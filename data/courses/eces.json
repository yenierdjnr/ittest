00:00:30.830\nWe're gonna spend some time as\nCherokee was saying, really,\n\n15\n00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.800\nI think very appropriately, talking about\ntime traveling a little bit, right?\n\n16\n00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.041\nWe're gonna go back and take a look,\nat least in this discussion, this episode.\n\n17\n00:00:38.041 --> 00:00:41.450\nGo back and take a look at the history\nof cryptography a little better, right?\n\n18\n00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.383\nAnd figure out what's gone before, what\nwe've done, kind of where we come from.\n\n19\n00:00:46.383 --> 00:00:48.775\nIn order to understand some\nof the more interesting and\n\n20\n00:00:48.775 --> 00:00:52.057\nexciting things that we're gonna be\ntalking about in upcoming episodes.\n\n21\n00:00:52.057 --> 00:00:56.733\nAs we continue to talk about,\nnot just how we apply encryption, but\n\n22\n00:00:56.733 --> 00:01:01.520\nthe different kinds of algorithms,\nsymmetric, asymmetric.\n\n23\n00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.720\nWhere encryption comes from.\n\n24\n00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.240\nHow we apply protections and\nwhat we use and\n\n25\n00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.817\nhow we use it in order to\naccomplish those particular goals.\n\n26\n00:01:08.817 --> 00:01:11.403\nSo when we think about\nthe history of cryptography,\n\n27\n00:01:11.403 --> 00:01:14.479\nwhat we're really thinking about is,\nand as Cherokee said.\n\n28\n00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.297\nYou're going back in time looking\nat what we've done before,\n\n29\n00:01:17.297 --> 00:01:18.953\nwhere does cryptography come from?\n\n30\n00:01:18.953 --> 00:01:23.124\nWhen we think about the history\nof cryptography we really have to\n\n31\n00:01:23.124 --> 00:01:24.987\ngo back thousands of years.\n\n32\n00:01:24.987 --> 00:01:27.380\nAnd that may sound\nsurprising to a lot of you.\n\n33\n00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.918\nWhen you think about the fact that\nencryption and cryptography is really,\n\n34\n00:01:31.918 --> 00:01:33.510\nat least today, anyway.\n\n35\n00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.967\nA computer driven, kind of modern thought\nprocess from a technology perspective.\n\n36\n00:01:35.967 --> 00:01:38.091\nWe use it in smartphones,\nwe use it in computers.\n\n37\n00:01:38.091 --> 00:01:44.583\nWe use it to protect bank transactions,\nwe use it to save card medical records.\n\n38\n00:01:44.583 --> 00:01:47.576\nWe use it for\nmost of the things we think about today.\n\n39\n00:01:47.576 --> 00:01:50.738\nGenerically lumped under\nthe concept of PII,\n\n40\n00:01:50.738 --> 00:01:54.313\npersonally identifiable information,\nP-I-I.\n\n41\n00:01:54.313 --> 00:01:57.262\nAnd the protection of those\nkinds of pieces of data,\n\n42\n00:01:57.262 --> 00:01:59.482\nthose kinds of pieces of information.\n\n43\n00:01:59.482 --> 00:02:04.143\nAnd as a result, we may think, and\nindeed in some respects we would be right,\n\n44\n00:02:04.143 --> 00:02:06.390\nthat this is a more modern approach.\n\n45\n00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.230\nA more modern thought\nprocess to what we do.\n\n46\n00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:15.490\nBut the need to provide confidentiality,\nprotect and safeguard private information.\n\n47\n00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.750\nWe'll use the air quotes for\nprivate, right?\n\n48\n00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.200\nWhatever that may have been classified\nas in the mind of person who creates it.\n\n49\n00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.468\nThe data owner over, basically\nthe entire recorded history of humanity.\n\n50\n00:02:27.468 --> 00:02:30.690\nGoing back thousands of years\nhas always been the case right?\n\n51\n00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.150\nWe've never really not\nhad a reason to somehow,\n\n52\n00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.800\nsome way think through the logic of\nhow we would protect something, right?\n\n53\n00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.821\nSo, if Cherokee and\n\n54\n00:02:38.821 --> 00:02:42.733\nI are talking, and I'm telling her\nsomething, let's just say off camera.\n\n55\n00:02:42.733 --> 00:02:46.500\nSo we're not talking to you, and\nyou're not hearing us right now.\n\n56\n00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.820\nAnd I say, hey Cherokee, keep that secret.\n\n57\n00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.230\nThere's an implied contract there, right?\n\n58\n00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.210\nI'm giving her,\nI'm sharing some information with her.\n\n59\n00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.940\nShe's hopefully gonna take that and\n\n60\n00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.870\ndo whatever she needs to do to protect\nthat data, that information in some way.\n\n61\n00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.810\nBut that just may be simply her\nnot telling anybody, right?\n\n62\n00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.203\nI mean, she just may simply keep\nthat information to herself.\n\n63\n00:03:07.203 --> 00:03:11.534\nBut she may also protect or\nprovide additional protections for\n\n64\n00:03:11.534 --> 00:03:12.929\nthat information.\n\n65\n00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:17.070\nThat involve one or more mechanisms,\nor one or more tools, or one or\n\n66\n00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.240\nmore techniques.\n\n67\n00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.950\nOr we could call those things and\n\n68\n00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.630\nrefer to them by a bunch of\ndifferent names and adjectives.\n\n69\n00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.590\nBut ultimately, she would apply some\nsort of cryptographic thought process or\n\n70\n00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.485\nprotection.\n\n71\n00:03:28.485 --> 00:03:33.190\nIf she was worried about, and\nI was worried about the integrity and\n\n72\n00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.720\nthe confidentiality of this data.\n\n73\n00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.291\nAnd these are very important words\nwhen we talk about cryptography and\n\n74\n00:03:39.291 --> 00:03:40.872\nthe history of cryptography.\n\n75\n00:03:40.872 --> 00:03:45.255\nWe mentioned them a lot as being two of\nthe three pillars of information security,\n\n76\n00:03:45.255 --> 00:03:46.980\nthe third being availability.\n\n77\n00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.082\nWe often talk about CIA,\nright, or the Iron Triangle.\n\n78\n00:03:50.082 --> 00:03:51.980\nYou hear it for two different ways.\n\n79\n00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.280\nBut ultimately when we think about\nencryption and we think about decryption.\n\n80\n00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.480\nAnd we think about\nthe protection of information.\n\n81\n00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.388\nWe're really gonna focus our\nconversations on the cryptography.\n\n82\n00:04:03.388 --> 00:04:08.420\nAnd as a result we're gonna focus on the\nconfidentiality and the integrity pieces.\n\n83\n00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.090\nAvailability is part of that,\nwe wanna think about availability.\n\n84\n00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.740\nBut if we make the mythical Iron Triangle,\nright out of, I'm off to the side here.\n\n85\n00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.198\nIf we make kind of that iron\ntriangle thought process.\n\n86\n00:04:19.198 --> 00:04:23.940\nAnd at one of the three areas we put\neach of the three items we talked about,\n\n87\n00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.420\nC, I, and A.\n\n88\n00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.220\nWe wanna always be aware of all three.\n\n89\n00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.680\nBut availability, while it's very critical\nto our conversation of cryptography.\n\n90\n00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.420\nBecause we wanna keep information\navailable for those authorized to see it,\n\n91\n00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.890\nbut keep it away from people that\nare not authorized to see it.\n\n92\n00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.022\nAnd we'll delve more into this thought\nprocess at length in some of our\n\n93\n00:04:42.022 --> 00:04:43.839\nfuture conversations on these topics.\n\n94\n00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:47.214\nBut we really wanna start\nout our conversation here by\n\n95\n00:04:47.214 --> 00:04:51.041\nfocusing on the idea of, and\nwe're gonna define the terms.\n\n96\n00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:53.580\nBut focusing on the idea\nof confidentiality,\n\n97\n00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.420\nessentially providing protection for data.\n\n98\n00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.280\nKeeping it away from bad people.\n\n99\n00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.880\nAnd allowing authorized people to see it.\n\n100\n00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.820\nSo keep good data away from bad people,\nis what I often tell my customers and\n\n101\n00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.460\nstudents when we talk about this.\n\n102\n00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.762\nAnd with regards to integrity, we want\nto think about the ability to be able\n\n103\n00:05:09.762 --> 00:05:12.441\nto change control and\nchange manage our data.\n\n104\n00:05:12.441 --> 00:05:16.184\nSo that data is not modified,\nis not changed without our knowledge and\n\n105\n00:05:16.184 --> 00:05:16.952\nour consent.\n\n106\n00:05:16.952 --> 00:05:20.462\nKnowledge and consent of the owner and\nprobably the custodian.\n\n107\n00:05:20.462 --> 00:05:22.750\nWe're gonna define those terms as well.\n\n108\n00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.834\n&gt;&gt; So, Adam [LAUGH] I've read in\nthe past that, royals used to, in order.\n\n109\n00:05:26.834 --> 00:05:29.094\nYou talked about about\nhumans keeping secrets and\n\n110\n00:05:29.094 --> 00:05:31.590\ntrying to keep that information secret.\n\n111\n00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.899\nThey would take their slaves and kind of\nshave their scalps, tattoo a message in,\n\n112\n00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:38.409\nlet their hair grow out and\nsend them on the way.\n\n113\n00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:40.120\nBut when we're talking\nabout today's society,\n\n114\n00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.490\nI don't think that'd be too acceptable,\nright?\n\n115\n00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:43.397\n&gt;&gt; Well, so that-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n116\n00:05:43.397 --> 00:05:44.920\n&gt;&gt; So probably not.\n\n117\n00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.051\nYou can look up here.\nThere's not much left to shave.\n\n118\n00:05:47.051 --> 00:05:48.951\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So potentially could do that but\n\n119\n00:05:48.951 --> 00:05:52.913\nI'm kind of anti the whole shave the head,\nput the tattoo on the scalp thing.\n\n120\n00:05:52.913 --> 00:05:54.303\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think that would be a little painful.\n\n121\n00:05:54.303 --> 00:05:57.944\nBut that's not just something that\nmay have been done historically.\n\n122\n00:05:57.944 --> 00:06:01.138\nBut that's also a plot line for\na more recent movie.\n\n123\n00:06:01.138 --> 00:06:06.048\n&gt;&gt; If you actually take a look\nat the Jackie Chan movies.\n\n124\n00:06:06.048 --> 00:06:09.556\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The one where he is [INAUDIBLE] police\n\n125\n00:06:09.556 --> 00:06:14.585\nguy and he's doing the whole\ninternational police thing.\n\n126\n00:06:14.585 --> 00:06:17.379\nI'm trying to think of name\nof the movie now, Rush Hour.\n\n127\n00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:20.127\nIt's Rush Hour 2 or\nRush Hour 3, one of the two.\n\n128\n00:06:20.127 --> 00:06:21.958\nWhere they're dealing\nwith the Chinese triads.\n\n129\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.019\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And the messenger for\n\n130\n00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:28.560\nthe triad with the list of triad\nbosses is a woman, it turns out.\n\n131\n00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.499\nWho has her head shaved, has the list\ntattooed on the back of her head and neck,\n\n132\n00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:33.281\nessentially.\n\n133\n00:06:33.281 --> 00:06:35.610\nAnd, she normally has a wig on.\n\n134\n00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:36.750\nShe's a performer.\n\n135\n00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.590\nHas a wig,\nlooks like she has a full head of hair.\n\n136\n00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:39.830\nBut, at some point, she takes it off, and\n\n137\n00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.390\nyou actually see the tattoo\non the back of her head.\n\n138\n00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.310\nSo, it's not just for\nhistory anymore, boys and girls.\n\n139\n00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.710\nWe actually see evidence of that\nin the real world, in modern day.\n\n140\n00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.045\nAll these kind of things occur, right?.\n\n141\n00:06:50.045 --> 00:06:53.840\nI mean, there are and\nhave been for thousands of years.\n\n142\n00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.360\nMany different ways for us to send and\n\n143\n00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.867\nreceive information\ncontextually on a timeline.\n\n144\n00:06:59.867 --> 00:07:02.724\nWhen you think about\nthe technology of the day,\n\n145\n00:07:02.724 --> 00:07:05.790\nsomething that was\npermanent like a tattoo.\n\n146\n00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:10.692\nThat could be entrusted to an individual\nby literally putting it on them,\n\n147\n00:07:10.692 --> 00:07:14.590\nand then having them-\n&gt;&gt; This evolution is just amazing.\n\n148\n00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:17.602\nThe way that we work, if you think\nabout it, and to where we're headed.\n\n149\n00:07:17.602 --> 00:07:21.260\n&gt;&gt; Well, the continuing advent of\ntechnology is always interesting to look\n\n150\n00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.620\nat from a timeline and\nfrom an arc perspective.\n\n151\n00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:29.120\nBut when you look at the limitations\nof the time, something like tattooing.\n\n152\n00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.120\nWhile it was permanent so\nyou would always carry it.\n\n153\n00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.812\nAnd you couldn't screw it up because\nsomebody read the message and\n\n154\n00:07:33.812 --> 00:07:34.548\nknew what it was.\n\n155\n00:07:34.548 --> 00:07:37.478\nSo long as you put it on there\nthe right way, it was permanently,\n\n156\n00:07:37.478 --> 00:07:40.373\nindelibly marked on you and\nthe message would be transmitted.\n\n157\n00:07:40.373 --> 00:07:44.405\nBut the problem is of course,\nsomebody captured you, right, in theory,\n\n158\n00:07:44.405 --> 00:07:46.071\nor found you as the messenger.\n\n159\n00:07:46.071 --> 00:07:47.235\nThey would have the message.\n\n160\n00:07:47.235 --> 00:07:49.462\nEven if it was in code,\nthey would have the message.\n\n161\n00:07:49.462 --> 00:07:53.272\nMore modern means where we are\ntransmitting electronic bits and bytes,\n\n162\n00:07:53.272 --> 00:07:54.091\nessentially.\n\n163\n00:07:54.091 --> 00:07:55.597\nLittle bits of data, ones and\n\n164\n00:07:55.597 --> 00:07:58.747\nzeroes that go through some\nsort of digital transformation.\n\n165\n00:07:58.747 --> 00:08:01.169\nOr multiple rounds,\nwhat we would call XORing,\n\n166\n00:08:01.169 --> 00:08:03.126\nmultiple rounds of transformations.\n\n167\n00:08:03.126 --> 00:08:07.011\nAnd we'll talk a lot about this\nwhole though process At some point,\n\n168\n00:08:07.011 --> 00:08:09.544\nwhen we go through those mechanisms today.\n\n169\n00:08:09.544 --> 00:08:12.734\nIt's not that much different in some\nrespects than what we would have\n\n170\n00:08:12.734 --> 00:08:13.510\ndone years ago.\n\n171\n00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:16.720\nThe difference is we're using different\ntools and we're using different\n\n172\n00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.500\ntechnologies, but the end result\nis the same, the need is the same.\n\n173\n00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.742\nKeep good data away from bad people.\n\n174\n00:08:21.742 --> 00:08:25.450\nFigure out how to translate that\ndata into a protected package.\n\n175\n00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:30.490\nAnd send it securely off to people that\nthen are gonna be able to receive it,\n\n176\n00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:32.170\ndecode it essentially.\n\n177\n00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:35.303\nDecrypt it and understand it and\nperhaps respond in kind.\n\n178\n00:08:35.303 --> 00:08:41.760\nThere have been, and continues to be,\nongoing conversations in many communities.\n\n179\n00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.726\nAbout the efficacy and the value of\nsecurity and the ways we apply it.\n\n180\n00:08:45.726 --> 00:08:51.610\nAnd there have been, and continue to be,\nmany let's say, revelations, right?\n\n181\n00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:54.654\nFrom time to time about the impact\nof the security mechanisms\n\n182\n00:08:54.654 --> 00:08:57.705\nbeing used by governments and\ngovernment driven entities.\n\n183\n00:08:57.705 --> 00:09:03.660\nBoth here in the United States and abroad,\nacross many countries in the world today.\n\n184\n00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:08.720\nJust look back over the timeline of\nthe last few years from the teens and\n\n185\n00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.340\nthe 2000s, 2010, 11, 12, etc.\n\n186\n00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:15.469\nYou will see multiple disclosures\noccurring from different parties.\n\n187\n00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.150\nMany from WikiLeaks,\nothers from other areas,\n\n188\n00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:22.510\nit doesn't matter who or\nwhat at the end of the day is behind them.\n\n189\n00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:27.028\nThere's ample evidence of the fact for\nevery mechanism that is being used to\n\n190\n00:09:27.028 --> 00:09:30.145\nprovide security,\nencryption and cryptography.\n\n191\n00:09:30.145 --> 00:09:33.610\nThere are more than adequate\ntools on the far side\n\n192\n00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:36.400\nof that conversation in the middle.\n\n193\n00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.955\nTo potentially interdict and\n\n194\n00:09:37.955 --> 00:09:40.886\ninteract with that data in\na way that allows us to see it.\n\n195\n00:09:40.886 --> 00:09:45.450\nAnd decrypt it if we are a government, or\nan entity that has access to these tools.\n\n196\n00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:47.848\nWhether it's occurring before\nthe data is encrypted.\n\n197\n00:09:47.848 --> 00:09:51.030\nWhether it is,\nas has come to light more recently,\n\n198\n00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:53.776\nmost likely the case in\nmany of these cases.\n\n199\n00:09:53.776 --> 00:09:56.560\nWhere we're not so\nmuch breaking the crypto graphy.\n\n200\n00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.745\nBut rather jumping in\nto the message stream,\n\n201\n00:09:58.745 --> 00:10:03.170\ninteracting with it through malware and\na variety of other techniques and methods.\n\n202\n00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.669\nAnd getting copies of what\nwe call the plain text,\n\n203\n00:10:05.669 --> 00:10:07.760\nthe data that has not been encrypted yet.\n\n204\n00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:11.088\nAnd we're grabbing before\nit goes through one or\n\n205\n00:10:11.088 --> 00:10:14.185\nmore of these programs\nthat does encrypt it.\n\n206\n00:10:14.185 --> 00:10:17.504\nOr in some respects, as has been\nproven beyond any reasonable doubt.\n\n207\n00:10:17.504 --> 00:10:21.444\nThrough collusion, through partnership,\nthrough unspoken and\n\n208\n00:10:21.444 --> 00:10:23.840\nuntalked about arrangements.\n\n209\n00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:28.295\nThere is ample evidence as well\nthat many technology companies,\n\n210\n00:10:28.295 --> 00:10:29.922\nvendors and entities.\n\n211\n00:10:29.922 --> 00:10:33.907\nHave allowed governments to have\naccess to their source code and\n\n212\n00:10:33.907 --> 00:10:36.057\naccess to their infrastructure.\n\n213\n00:10:36.057 --> 00:10:40.347\nIn ways that allow them to interact\nwith data at multiple phases or\n\n214\n00:10:40.347 --> 00:10:43.160\nplaces in the transmission chain.\n\n215\n00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:48.400\nAnd as a result, data may be interdicted,\nmay be compromised, copied, modified, etc.\n\n216\n00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:53.127\nBoth while it is in plain text form,\nand as we see and have had evidence of,\n\n217\n00:10:53.127 --> 00:10:54.437\nin encrypted form.\n\n218\n00:10:54.437 --> 00:10:58.868\nAnd there is really\nunfortunately no viable, good,\n\n219\n00:10:58.868 --> 00:11:03.600\nbeyond any reproach,\nbeyond any reasonable doubt way.\n\n220\n00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:08.302\nTo verify and validate that that\ndata has not been compromised in\n\n221\n00:11:08.302 --> 00:11:11.275\nthe average normal transaction space.\n\n222\n00:11:11.275 --> 00:11:13.525\nI'm not saying there aren't\nsecure methods out there.\n\n223\n00:11:13.525 --> 00:11:15.691\nI'm not saying there aren't ways\nto send and receive data securely.\n\n224\n00:11:15.691 --> 00:11:20.313\nWithout any liability or thought process\nabout the encryption being broken.\n\n225\n00:11:20.313 --> 00:11:22.646\nBut the reality of these conversations,\n\n226\n00:11:22.646 --> 00:11:26.185\nwe might as well lay it out right\nnow as we're getting started.\n\n227\n00:11:26.185 --> 00:11:29.213\nAnd we'll continue to come back to it,\nis beyond any doubts, so\n\n228\n00:11:29.213 --> 00:11:30.402\nyou have it in your mind.\n\n229\n00:11:30.402 --> 00:11:34.737\nIf you don't want anybody to see,\nread, hear, listen to,\n\n230\n00:11:34.737 --> 00:11:37.340\nunderstand what you are doing.\n\n231\n00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:40.521\nYou should not use an electronic\ndevice to send information today.\n\n232\n00:11:40.521 --> 00:11:45.417\nBecause the reality is that beyond\nany thought process we can share\n\n233\n00:11:45.417 --> 00:11:46.840\nwith you here.\n\n234\n00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.451\nIf somebody wants that\ninformation badly enough, and\n\n235\n00:11:49.451 --> 00:11:51.218\nI don't mean the average somebody.\n\n236\n00:11:51.218 --> 00:11:55.515\nI don't mean myself, Cherokee,\nany of us, just even you, generically.\n\n237\n00:11:55.515 --> 00:11:59.737\nUnless you work for an entity with three\nletters in its name, for a government,\n\n238\n00:11:59.737 --> 00:12:02.270\nin which case you do have\naccess to those tools.\n\n239\n00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:03.771\nAnd there are people out there that do.\n\n240\n00:12:03.771 --> 00:12:06.139\nThat's the whole reason we're\nhaving this conversation.\n\n241\n00:12:06.139 --> 00:12:10.066\nBut for an average individual, sending or\nreceiving something on Skype, sending and\n\n242\n00:12:10.066 --> 00:12:11.700\nreceiving something on Whatsapp.\n\n243\n00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:16.263\nSending and receiving something on any of\nthe numerous applications out there that\n\n244\n00:12:16.263 --> 00:12:18.540\nare secure at some level.\n\n245\n00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:21.870\nThat traffic, for the most part,\nis not monitored, and\n\n246\n00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:23.470\nnobody really pays attention to it.\n\n247\n00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:26.410\nThere may be a recording of it,\nsomewhere in a government data base.\n\n248\n00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:28.420\nBut, that doesn't mean\nthat it's been decoded.\n\n249\n00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.650\nIt simply means it's sitting\nthere in encrypted form.\n\n250\n00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:35.322\nAnd if someone decides you have now become\na person of interest, they may go back and\n\n251\n00:12:35.322 --> 00:12:37.320\nstart to look at that data.\n\n252\n00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.913\nBut, there are many tools,\ntechniques and approaches.\n\n253\n00:12:40.913 --> 00:12:45.452\nThat would allow a government or\nan entity with those kinds of\n\n254\n00:12:45.452 --> 00:12:50.260\nresources to take that kind of data and\npotentially decrypt it.\n\n255\n00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:54.450\nI say potentially because we don't\nknow for sure that that will happen.\n\n256\n00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:56.120\nWe don't know what the techniques and\ntools are.\n\n257\n00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:01.000\nFor the most part, despite what has\nbeen publicly discussed or Wikileaks and\n\n258\n00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.650\nother forums, right?\n\n259\n00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:03.980\nThere is evidence of that.\n\n260\n00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:08.470\nBut we just don't know for sure whether\nthose tools are being used today,\n\n261\n00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:10.000\nthey were used at some point.\n\n262\n00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.238\nFor everything you find out about,\n\n263\n00:13:11.238 --> 00:13:14.060\nthere are newer iterations of that\nstuff you're not hearing about.\n\n264\n00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:20.160\nBecause the Edward Snowdens of\nthe world have done this kind of work.\n\n265\n00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.676\nHave taken this data for a variety of\nreasons, moral, ethical, political, etc.\n\n266\n00:13:24.676 --> 00:13:27.690\nAnd have decided to make it public,\ngood or bad, right or wrong.\n\n267\n00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.910\nWe're not here to discuss that or\njudge that in any way.\n\n268\n00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:33.967\nAnd as a result they've\nput out a frozen snapshot,\n\n269\n00:13:33.967 --> 00:13:36.818\nessentially a moment in\ntime representation.\n\n270\n00:13:36.818 --> 00:13:40.933\nOf what was at that point anyway\nperhaps state of the art,\n\n271\n00:13:40.933 --> 00:13:43.520\nperhaps old, perhaps in process.\n\n272\n00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.880\nWe don't really know.\n\n273\n00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.460\nWe don't have the whole picture in other\nwords, it's very hard to tell for sure.\n\n274\n00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.010\nBut we know, at a certain point,\nthese tools they talked about,\n\n275\n00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:53.080\nthese techniques they would\nhave discussed were being used.\n\n276\n00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.570\nBut you don't know that\nat that moment in time,\n\n277\n00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:56.620\nthat was the only thing that was done.\n\n278\n00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.985\nAnd quite honestly, we don't know\nthat since then that there is not.\n\n279\n00:13:59.985 --> 00:14:03.365\nAnd I'm sure we can pretty much count on\nthe fact that there are newer techniques\n\n280\n00:14:03.365 --> 00:14:04.995\nand technology being used.\n\n281\n00:14:04.995 --> 00:14:06.827\n&gt;&gt; I'm just not privy to that information,\nAdam.\n\n282\n00:14:06.827 --> 00:14:08.127\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, none of us are.\n\n283\n00:14:08.127 --> 00:14:09.115\nRight.\nI mean, at least not right now, anyway.\n\n284\n00:14:09.115 --> 00:14:12.105\nBut, the reality is,\nthere are things like quantum computing\n\n285\n00:14:12.105 --> 00:14:14.435\nthat are becoming a reality\nin our world today.\n\n286\n00:14:14.435 --> 00:14:17.355\nIf you're not familiar with it,\ngo out and use Google.\n\n287\n00:14:17.355 --> 00:14:18.120\nLook it up.\n\n288\n00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.997\nThe idea of changing the way we build\nthe fundamental building blocks and\n\n289\n00:14:20.997 --> 00:14:22.711\nelements of computing from the ground up.\n\n290\n00:14:22.711 --> 00:14:28.423\nTo shift away from the traditional 45,\n50 plus year old model at this point.\n\n291\n00:14:28.423 --> 00:14:31.575\nOf transistors and\nsilicon and circuits and\n\n292\n00:14:31.575 --> 00:14:35.900\nreally go towards essentially\na very different model.\n\n293\n00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:37.178\nTo build computers from the ground up.\n\n294\n00:14:37.178 --> 00:14:40.827\nApplying and using the laws of physics and\nthe transmission of light.\n\n295\n00:14:40.827 --> 00:14:45.293\nTo be able to replace the transmission\nof electrical charges back and\n\n296\n00:14:45.293 --> 00:14:47.520\nforth across silicon chips.\n\n297\n00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.330\nAnd when that becomes a reality, and\n\n298\n00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:53.160\nit is today, quantum computing works,\nit's been done in labs.\n\n299\n00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.860\nThey are scaling it to make\nit commercially available.\n\n300\n00:14:55.860 --> 00:15:00.190\nAnd at some point in our lifetime, you\nwill have and will use quantum computers.\n\n301\n00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:05.315\nBut until that becomes a reality,\noutside of industrial, and\n\n302\n00:15:05.315 --> 00:15:08.035\nessentially educational and\nresearch areas.\n\n303\n00:15:08.035 --> 00:15:11.525\nWe don't really see that\ntechnology day-to-day today,\n\n304\n00:15:11.525 --> 00:15:14.685\nwe don't know what's being\ndone with quantum computers.\n\n305\n00:15:14.685 --> 00:15:18.145\nWe don't know if they are more advanced\nthan we've been lead to believe.\n\n306\n00:15:18.145 --> 00:15:22.642\nAnd we certainly don't know if they're\nbeing used in novel and innovative ways,\n\n307\n00:15:22.642 --> 00:15:23.889\nnon-commercially.\n\n308\n00:15:23.889 --> 00:15:27.242\nBy governments and security\napparatuses around the world today.\n\n309\n00:15:27.242 --> 00:15:29.858\nTo be able to take on normal cryptography.\n\n310\n00:15:29.858 --> 00:15:34.567\nAnd in the blink of an eye literally crack\nthe most advanced algorithms in the world\n\n311\n00:15:34.567 --> 00:15:36.950\nwe currently use commercially.\n\n312\n00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:40.429\nAnd I'm not saying there is that\npossibility, I'm not saying there is not.\n\n313\n00:15:40.429 --> 00:15:42.301\nYou're gonna hear a lot\nof this kind of back and\n\n314\n00:15:42.301 --> 00:15:44.630\nforth conversation in all these episodes.\n\n315\n00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:49.403\nAnd I'm not indicating that I'm\na conspiracy person who thinks that\n\n316\n00:15:49.403 --> 00:15:52.534\nthere are dark shadows\nbehind every corner.\n\n317\n00:15:52.534 --> 00:15:56.870\nBut I'm just pointing out to you\nthe reality of the world we live in.\n\n318\n00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:00.839\nThere is the modern world that we see and\nwe interact with commercially And\n\n319\n00:16:00.839 --> 00:16:04.561\nthere is the shadow world that we\ndon't necessarily interact with.\n\n320\n00:16:04.561 --> 00:16:07.533\nBut as IT professionals,\nas security professionals,\n\n321\n00:16:07.533 --> 00:16:11.265\nas in this case perhaps encryption\npeople that are looking to apply and\n\n322\n00:16:11.265 --> 00:16:13.620\nbecome specialists in cryptography.\n\n323\n00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:18.690\nThere is a whole separate world below the\nworld we live in that operates parallel\n\n324\n00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:24.030\nto us every day and enshrouds, envelopes,\nand interacts with everything we do.\n\n325\n00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:27.120\nAnd as a result, most people don't think\nabout it, don't stop, don't look at it,\n\n326\n00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.560\ndon't wanna know about it.\n\n327\n00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:31.580\nBut people that do what we do for\na living, what I do for a living, and\n\n328\n00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:34.070\nwhat some of you do for\na living or wanna do for\n\n329\n00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:37.010\na living, interact with that\nworld on a regular basis.\n\n330\n00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:40.950\nAnd that world has spooky,\nscary technology,\n\n331\n00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:44.160\nthe likes of which you just don't\nhave an idea how to fathom.\n\n332\n00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.870\nWe're not gonna talk about all that\nright now, we're gonna turn and\n\n333\n00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:49.510\nreally focus on the history\nof how we got here.\n\n334\n00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:52.390\nBut really starting up\nthe discussion about history\n\n335\n00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:56.200\nis really the need to look ahead to\nwhere we are and what we're doing\n\n336\n00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.200\nto understand the value of looking\nback and see how far we've come.\n\n337\n00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.120\nSo that's what we wanna spend some\ntime doing and talking about.\n\n338\n00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.680\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we're gonna talk about\nsome rudimentary types of ciphers here, or\n\n339\n00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:05.710\nhow did it start?\n\n340\n00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:08.750\n&gt;&gt; Well, so the idea really behind it\nis probably a good place to start,\n\n341\n00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:10.500\nis with the definition\nof what cryptography is.\n\n342\n00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.052\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So we've been talking at it and\n\n343\n00:17:12.052 --> 00:17:15.007\nabout it, we've thrown a bunch of terms,\nand techniques, and\n\n344\n00:17:15.007 --> 00:17:16.938\nthought processes on the table, right.\n\n345\n00:17:16.938 --> 00:17:20.293\nBut the idea behind it is really the study\nof secure communication mechanisms.\n\n346\n00:17:20.293 --> 00:17:24.397\nWhen we define cryptography,\nwe're defining the art and science,\n\n347\n00:17:24.397 --> 00:17:29.278\nthe thought process of how we communicate\nsecurely, what that means, the dos and\n\n348\n00:17:29.278 --> 00:17:30.710\ndon'ts, if you will.\n\n349\n00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:34.967\nI could write a note to Cherokee and give\nher on this piece of paper I'm not gonna\n\n350\n00:17:34.967 --> 00:17:38.787\nshow it to you, I'm gonna show you\nthe back of it, woo, right there.\n\n351\n00:17:38.787 --> 00:17:40.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You gotta make the woo sound,\n\n352\n00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:41.840\nthat's the cool part about cryptography.\n\n353\n00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:45.536\nSo I'm gonna give her, and there is\nsomething on the other side of this paper,\n\n354\n00:17:45.536 --> 00:17:46.888\nbut I'm not gonna show you.\n\n355\n00:17:46.888 --> 00:17:51.515\nBut if I send this to her securely,\nand this is a secure communication.\n\n356\n00:17:51.515 --> 00:17:53.142\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because as you see when I send it over\n\n357\n00:17:53.142 --> 00:17:56.035\nhere, there's nothing there,\nyou can't see me give it to her,\n\n358\n00:17:56.035 --> 00:17:57.630\nas far as you know she's not there.\n\n359\n00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:00.700\nEven though you hear her laughing,\nthat's really her doppelganger,\n\n360\n00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:01.730\nthat's not really her.\n\n361\n00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:04.320\nSo when she gets it, right,\nand she then reads it,\n\n362\n00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.760\nand then she gives it back to me.\n\n363\n00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.670\nDo the spooky ghost thing, make it float.\n\n364\n00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:10.518\n&gt;&gt; Oo, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Oo, okay.\n\n365\n00:18:10.518 --> 00:18:13.107\nSo when we do that and\nwe give it back, I mean,\n\n366\n00:18:13.107 --> 00:18:16.350\nthat is one form of a secure\ncommunication channel.\n\n367\n00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:20.992\nAnd 5,000 years ago this may have\nbeen the beginning of cryptography.\n\n368\n00:18:20.992 --> 00:18:24.969\nThis would have been, hey,\nI have something I wanna give you, but\n\n369\n00:18:24.969 --> 00:18:28.377\nI'm not gonna write it down and\nsend it in the normal way,\n\n370\n00:18:28.377 --> 00:18:31.379\nI'm gonna write it down\nnot with actual English.\n\n371\n00:18:31.379 --> 00:18:34.490\nAnd I don't know if you can see that,\nbut it's just a little thing,\n\n372\n00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:38.199\nit says D1 server, it's just a note I have\nfor something I have to take care of for\n\n373\n00:18:38.199 --> 00:18:41.210\na customer, one of the machines\nI have to get into later.\n\n374\n00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:43.337\nBut instead what it would've been,\n\n375\n00:18:43.337 --> 00:18:47.620\nwould've been probably hieroglyphics or\nperhaps pictographs of some kind,\n\n376\n00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:50.230\nessentially early\nrepresentations of language.\n\n377\n00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:54.735\nWe often go back and think 5,000, 6,000\nyears ago, now roughly recorded history,\n\n378\n00:18:54.735 --> 00:18:59.180\nand we often point to the Egyptian\ncivilization as being probably\n\n379\n00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:04.060\none of the earliest examples of\nformal written down language and\n\n380\n00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.380\ntransmission through hieroglyphics.\n\n381\n00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:08.950\nThe Phoenicians are actually credited with\nthe first established written down and\n\n382\n00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:10.280\ntransmitted alphabet.\n\n383\n00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:14.300\nAnd the idea of creating the ability to\nwrite things down and transmit them in\n\n384\n00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:19.270\na formal way is often attributed to these\ntwo cultures thousands of years ago.\n\n385\n00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:24.040\nYou could go back 30,000, 40,000 years\nto cave drawings, and cave painting.\n\n386\n00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.341\nThe caves in La Croix in France, and\n\n387\n00:19:26.341 --> 00:19:31.256\nthe Aboriginal paintings on Ayers Rock and\nthings like this in Australia and\n\n388\n00:19:31.256 --> 00:19:35.733\nother places around the world where\nthese cultures would have been.\n\n389\n00:19:35.733 --> 00:19:39.480\nNative cultures from tens of thousands\nof years ago and their ability to\n\n390\n00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:43.166\ncommunicate, that is an early form\nof language, it is an early form of\n\n391\n00:19:43.166 --> 00:19:47.550\ncommunication, it may or may not be\nclassified as cryptographic communication.\n\n392\n00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:51.906\nBecause a picture of a herd of animals\nbeing chased by stick figures with spears\n\n393\n00:19:51.906 --> 00:19:55.470\nreally was meant to describe\nthe fact that people were hunting,\n\n394\n00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:58.506\nprobably not to hide the fact\nthat they were hunting and\n\n395\n00:19:58.506 --> 00:20:02.990\nthat they were really out partying having\na drink on the beach or something.\n\n396\n00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:07.950\nIt was essentially meant to explain\nto other people that they were doing\n\n397\n00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:13.040\nexactly what the pictures implied, so it's\nnot so much cryptography in those very\n\n398\n00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:17.632\nearly exchanges but rather being able to\ncommunicate using some sort of language.\n\n399\n00:20:17.632 --> 00:20:22.669\nBut as we then move forward into\nthe 5,000, 4,000, 6,000 year ago range and\n\n400\n00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:26.997\nwe think about the earliest examples of\nthe ability to be able to communicate but\n\n401\n00:20:26.997 --> 00:20:30.503\nusing pictographs, so\nusing hieroglyphs, things like that.\n\n402\n00:20:30.503 --> 00:20:35.126\nWe tend to then start often referring to,\nas I said, the Egyptian culture as being\n\n403\n00:20:35.126 --> 00:20:39.414\nthe one that perhaps first really used\nthis idea where you would have various\n\n404\n00:20:39.414 --> 00:20:43.858\nhieroglyphs that meant a variety of\nthings depending on what you understood.\n\n405\n00:20:43.858 --> 00:20:47.277\nThe Aztec, certainly,\nculture, the Incan culture,\n\n406\n00:20:47.277 --> 00:20:50.551\nmuch more recent in some\nrespects than some of those,\n\n407\n00:20:50.551 --> 00:20:55.690\nwould certainly be examples of these where\nthey had their own writing, Sanskrit.\n\n408\n00:20:55.690 --> 00:21:00.095\nThere's so many examples throughout\nhistory of languages that would fall into\n\n409\n00:21:00.095 --> 00:21:04.232\nthis category where we used these\nkinds of communication mechanisms.\n\n410\n00:21:04.232 --> 00:21:07.092\nSome lost to time,\nsome of these languages we can't decipher,\n\n411\n00:21:07.092 --> 00:21:09.942\nwe don't understand today because\nnobody's left that speaks them.\n\n412\n00:21:09.942 --> 00:21:13.622\nAnd we don't have the point of reference\nand what we would call the key,\n\n413\n00:21:13.622 --> 00:21:18.672\nthe ability to translate that language\nbecause we know a picture of a bird\n\n414\n00:21:18.672 --> 00:21:21.652\ninside a circle equals something,\nwhatever that is, and\n\n415\n00:21:21.652 --> 00:21:24.638\nwe would need the dictionary essentially,\nright, to be able to translate that.\n\n416\n00:21:24.638 --> 00:21:29.240\nSo the idea of cryptography provides\na way to send secure communications,\n\n417\n00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:33.880\nsend data, send a message,\nhide it through the process of encrypting.\n\n418\n00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:38.650\nAnd then once we receive or send and\nreceive that information securely on\n\n419\n00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:42.720\nthe far side, have somebody who's\nknowledgeable in that information and\n\n420\n00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.970\nthat system, decrypt or decode.\n\n421\n00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:49.200\nYou could say encode, decode, encrypt,\ndecrypt, the terms are synonymous.\n\n422\n00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:53.240\nEssentially, take plain text,\ntranslate it through a system,\n\n423\n00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:57.130\nrender it into cypher text,\nsend the cypher text securely,\n\n424\n00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:01.230\ntranslate the cypher text on\nthe far side back into plain text.\n\n425\n00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:05.520\nThis is what we do when we are using\ncryptography, and we keep the unauthorized\n\n426\n00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:09.170\npeople from seeing the data and\ninteracting with it and understanding it.\n\n427\n00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:13.070\nBut we wanna be specific here,\nbecause seeing is a relative concept.\n\n428\n00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:20.010\nWhen we send data securely in a\ncryptographic system, we are sending data.\n\n429\n00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:24.230\nAnd data can be intercepted,\ncan be culled or\n\n430\n00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:28.450\ncopied by a bad actor through\nsome sort of man-in-the-middle,\n\n431\n00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:32.100\nsome sort of variety of\ndifferent kinds of attacks.\n\n432\n00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:38.210\nThey can tap the wire, they can redirect\nus, they can masquerade or spoof,\n\n433\n00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:43.580\nthere's a lot of ways they may intercept\nor interdict the system with this data.\n\n434\n00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:46.650\nBut the idea is not that they can't get\nthe data, people often say this and\n\n435\n00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:49.630\ndon't really take the time to\nexplain the difference, or\n\n436\n00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:53.930\ncreate the subtlety we need to understand\nthe shades of grey that exist here.\n\n437\n00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:55.930\nIt's not about seeing the data,\n\n438\n00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:59.330\nit's about understanding what\nyou're seeing in order to decrypt.\n\n439\n00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:03.780\nWe don't mind when we send out securely\nin a cryptographically secure system\n\n440\n00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:06.090\nthat you get the scrambled or\nencrypted data.\n\n441\n00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:08.890\nI mean, in theory we mind it,\nwe don't want you to get it,\n\n442\n00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:11.420\nwe would prefer you don't have\naccess to it in the first place.\n\n443\n00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:15.800\nBut if you get access to it,\nthe system then has to be strong enough\n\n444\n00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:19.770\nto prevent you from taking that data and\ndecrypting it.\n\n445\n00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:23.560\nSo as a bad actor,\nif you get the encrypted stream\n\n446\n00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:25.760\nthat doesn't necessarily mean\nyou're gonna find out what I sent,\n\n447\n00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:30.000\nit just means you have the working\npieces of the puzzle to play with.\n\n448\n00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.553\nBut if you don't have the very important,\nand\n\n449\n00:23:32.553 --> 00:23:35.632\nultimately the single most\nimportant thing, the key,\n\n450\n00:23:35.632 --> 00:23:40.350\nthe instructions essentially, that help\nyou to take that data that's encrypted and\n\n451\n00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:44.479\nunwind the encryption through a variety\nof mechanisms, techniques, and\n\n452\n00:23:44.479 --> 00:23:48.649\napproaches, and we'll get into how\nall that works in upcoming episodes.\n\n453\n00:23:48.649 --> 00:23:52.241\nBut generically unwinding that\nto be able to walk it backwards,\n\n454\n00:23:52.241 --> 00:23:57.095\nif you don't have that, you've got a bunch\nof random scrambled garbage that probably\n\n455\n00:23:57.095 --> 00:23:58.570\ndoesn't do you any good.\n\n456\n00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:02.964\nI tell my customers, my students,\nall the time I don't worry about people\n\n457\n00:24:02.964 --> 00:24:07.800\nintercepting your encrypted data once we\nset up encryption and you're using it.\n\n458\n00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:11.533\nI worry about you not configuring\nencryption the right way and\n\n459\n00:24:11.533 --> 00:24:16.200\nmaking the encryption choices that will\nallow bad actors to decrypt your data\n\n460\n00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.570\nbecause you use weak encryption.\n\n461\n00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:21.938\nYou don't use strong enough keys,\nbig enough work factors,\n\n462\n00:24:21.938 --> 00:24:25.649\nlarge enough keyspaces and again,\nwe'll define all these terms.\n\n463\n00:24:25.649 --> 00:24:28.106\nThis is about learning\nan entirely new vocabulary.\n\n464\n00:24:28.106 --> 00:24:30.320\nYou're gonna learn how\nto speak a new language.\n\n465\n00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:33.370\nForget about Rosetta Stone,\nforget about Babel, right.\n\n466\n00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:36.520\nThis is much better, because you're\ngonna learn something practical,\n\n467\n00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.563\nwhich you can actually\napply to everyday life.\n\n468\n00:24:38.563 --> 00:24:40.524\nNot that learning other\nlanguages isn't practical,\n\n469\n00:24:40.524 --> 00:24:42.530\nit's very important to\nspeak other languages.\n\n470\n00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:45.728\nBut we're gonna learn about\nthe specificity of this language through\n\n471\n00:24:45.728 --> 00:24:48.870\nthe conversations, and the show and\ntell, and interaction demo and\n\n472\n00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:50.623\ndiscussions that we're gonna have.\n\n473\n00:24:50.623 --> 00:24:54.420\nCherokee's actually gonna teach us\nall that vocabulary on her own.\n\n474\n00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:56.592\nI'm gonna go sit down,\nand I'm gonna watch, and\n\n475\n00:24:56.592 --> 00:24:58.359\nshe is gonna tell you about everything.\n\n476\n00:24:58.359 --> 00:25:01.800\nCuz she is so excited to talk about\nthis topics, you cannot imagine.\n\n477\n00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.944\nBefore we came on camera she was telling\nme I have to be able to do encryption,\n\n478\n00:25:04.944 --> 00:25:07.843\nthis is the coolest thing and you\nare just gonna stand there and talk and\n\n479\n00:25:07.843 --> 00:25:09.981\nI'm gonna do everything,\nthat's what she said.\n\n480\n00:25:09.981 --> 00:25:13.199\n&gt;&gt; And it actually is the coolest thing,\nI absolutely adore encryption.\n\n481\n00:25:13.199 --> 00:25:15.077\nBut Adam, I'm looking at the time,\n\n482\n00:25:15.077 --> 00:25:19.480\nI'm almost wondering if we should go ahead\nand, okay, I was gonna say wrap it up but.\n\n483\n00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.486\n&gt;&gt; Almost.\n&gt;&gt; Wanna just do a couple of examples here\n\n484\n00:25:21.486 --> 00:25:23.330\nbefore we-\n&gt;&gt; I just wanna finish just this general\n\n485\n00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:24.466\nthought process, absolutely.\n\n486\n00:25:24.466 --> 00:25:26.280\nWe're not gonna get into\nall these emphasis.\n\n487\n00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.955\nCherokee knows looking at our notes,\n\n488\n00:25:27.955 --> 00:25:30.267\nwe do have a lot of stuff to\ndiscuss with the history.\n\n489\n00:25:30.267 --> 00:25:32.141\nAnd we're gonna go through and\n\n490\n00:25:32.141 --> 00:25:35.898\ntalk about things like mono\nalphabet substitution ciphers.\n\n491\n00:25:35.898 --> 00:25:38.651\nWe're gonna talk about poly\nalphabetic substitution ciphers.\n\n492\n00:25:38.651 --> 00:25:41.070\nWe're gonna talk about a lot of\ndifferent thought processes.\n\n493\n00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:44.287\nWe're gonna demo and show you some\ncool stuff in an upcoming episode.\n\n494\n00:25:44.287 --> 00:25:47.920\nBut just to round out this conversation\nreally before we finish up.\n\n495\n00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.345\nYou have the idea, and\n\n496\n00:25:49.345 --> 00:25:54.375\nthe thing we really have to think about\nas we begin is focusing on the mechanics.\n\n497\n00:25:54.375 --> 00:25:58.280\nFocusing on getting encryption\nright at the beginning.\n\n498\n00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.646\nAnd if we're strong enough.\n\n499\n00:25:59.646 --> 00:26:05.033\nIf we are just making sure we're crossing\nour Ts, dotting our Is, as the person or\n\n500\n00:26:05.033 --> 00:26:09.750\nthe entity that is implying, or\ntherefore using the encryption.\n\n501\n00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:14.059\nAnd we do are job exercise due diligence\nand due care to terms that security and\n\n502\n00:26:14.059 --> 00:26:17.715\nIT professionals have to live by,\nunderstand and know, right.\n\n503\n00:26:17.715 --> 00:26:22.486\nIf we use those things as watch words,\nor guides, to our thought process,\n\n504\n00:26:22.486 --> 00:26:25.020\nthen the bad actors can circle all day.\n\n505\n00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:29.513\nThey can grab our encrypted data out\nof our transmission streams, but\n\n506\n00:26:29.513 --> 00:26:33.640\nthe likelihood that they will\ndecrypt our data is very minimal.\n\n507\n00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:36.610\nIt's not zero and\nwe have to be clear about this as well.\n\n508\n00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:39.765\nThere is always a possibility,\nperhaps remote,\n\n509\n00:26:39.765 --> 00:26:42.167\nperhaps real, and ever present, and\n\n510\n00:26:42.167 --> 00:26:47.739\ncertainly likely depending on our ability\nto successfully implement a crypto system.\n\n511\n00:26:47.739 --> 00:26:52.723\nThe entirety of the encryption engine,\nplain text, the key,\n\n512\n00:26:52.723 --> 00:26:55.460\nthe algorithm, the cipher text.\n\n513\n00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:58.979\nThat whole thought process together,\nright, or\n\n514\n00:26:58.979 --> 00:27:02.761\nthe whole enchilada as we say,\nis the crypto system.\n\n515\n00:27:02.761 --> 00:27:07.945\nDepending on how strong the crypto system\nis, there is perhaps a very small, perhaps\n\n516\n00:27:07.945 --> 00:27:12.913\na very big, perhaps something in between\nlikelihood, that a bad actor dedicated\n\n517\n00:27:12.913 --> 00:27:17.665\nwith resources, time, and the ability and\nmost importantly the patience for\n\n518\n00:27:17.665 --> 00:27:22.566\nsitting chat through it all can likely\nbreak the encryption and decode our data.\n\n519\n00:27:22.566 --> 00:27:26.307\nThe question is whether they can do it in\na what we would call a reasonable amount\n\n520\n00:27:26.307 --> 00:27:27.225\nof amount of time.\n\n521\n00:27:27.225 --> 00:27:32.651\nIn other words, if you get my encrypted\ndata but it takes you a million years\n\n522\n00:27:32.651 --> 00:27:37.836\nwith current technology to decrypt\nthat message there is an end point.\n\n523\n00:27:37.836 --> 00:27:39.419\nYou will decrypt that message\nat some point in the future,\n\n524\n00:27:39.419 --> 00:27:40.206\nthere's no doubt about it.\n\n525\n00:27:40.206 --> 00:27:42.596\n&gt;&gt; Because that data might be\nirrelevant at that point in time.\n\n526\n00:27:42.596 --> 00:27:45.747\n&gt;&gt; But, exactly right, by that\npoint in time, who knows whether or\n\n527\n00:27:45.747 --> 00:27:47.363\nnot that's gonna be important.\n\n528\n00:27:47.363 --> 00:27:49.324\nIt's very likely it won't be\nif it takes a million years.\n\n529\n00:27:49.324 --> 00:27:51.239\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And as a result,\n\n530\n00:27:51.239 --> 00:27:54.162\nwe say that it's always possible.\n\n531\n00:27:54.162 --> 00:27:57.153\nWe have to have in the back of our mind\nthe knowledge that at some point that data\n\n532\n00:27:57.153 --> 00:27:58.687\nwill be exposed if we wait long enough.\n\n533\n00:27:58.687 --> 00:28:03.782\nBut we talk about the reasonableness\nof the ability to decrypt.\n\n534\n00:28:03.782 --> 00:28:08.475\nAnd if that timeline is too long, then we\nsay that essentially, for our purposes,\n\n535\n00:28:08.475 --> 00:28:12.106\nit's not going to be decrypted,\nand therefore, it is secure.\n\n536\n00:28:12.106 --> 00:28:17.051\nBut if that timeline starts being chipped\naway at because technology gets better\n\n537\n00:28:17.051 --> 00:28:22.155\nevery year, and therefore our protection\nis lessened every year by a percentage.\n\n538\n00:28:22.155 --> 00:28:24.348\nAnd this is a direct correlation.\n\n539\n00:28:24.348 --> 00:28:25.815\nTechnology gets better,\n\n540\n00:28:25.815 --> 00:28:29.755\nour protection level is gonna be\nweakened as a result of this, right.\n\n541\n00:28:29.755 --> 00:28:32.211\nSo this is gonna be something\nwe have to think about, and\n\n542\n00:28:32.211 --> 00:28:34.894\nsomething called Moore's Law\nis gonna come into play here.\n\n543\n00:28:34.894 --> 00:28:36.625\nWe're gonna talk about that and\n\n544\n00:28:36.625 --> 00:28:41.048\ndo a little mathematical exercise with you\nto show you that a million years worth of\n\n545\n00:28:41.048 --> 00:28:44.930\nprotection today is actually not as\nstrong as you would think it is.\n\n546\n00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:48.269\nWithin ten years, which is a very\nreasonable amount of time for\n\n547\n00:28:48.269 --> 00:28:49.090\ncertain data.\n\n548\n00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:51.268\nWe could take that million year mark and\n\n549\n00:28:51.268 --> 00:28:55.550\ncut that down to something that\nmay actually be feasible to break.\n\n550\n00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:56.469\nAnd as a result,\n\n551\n00:28:56.469 --> 00:29:00.095\nif you're keeping business records\nunder guidelines and laws.\n\n552\n00:29:00.095 --> 00:29:03.190\nIn the US you have a federal\nregulation to keep it for seven years.\n\n553\n00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:06.012\nIn Germany and other countries,\nyou have to keep this as records for\n\n554\n00:29:06.012 --> 00:29:06.763\nten years by law.\n\n555\n00:29:06.763 --> 00:29:07.760\nIt varies around the world.\n\n556\n00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:12.224\nIf you're keeping business data for ten\nyears by statute and you're encrypting it,\n\n557\n00:29:12.224 --> 00:29:15.200\nand we can get into it prior\nto the execution of that data,\n\n558\n00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:18.435\nthat may still be incredibly\nrelevant to certain bad actors.\n\n559\n00:29:18.435 --> 00:29:22.124\nI'm not suggesting that ten years is or\nis not a long amount of time,\n\n560\n00:29:22.124 --> 00:29:25.424\nI'm just pointing out to you that\nto go from a million to ten or\n\n561\n00:29:25.424 --> 00:29:29.309\nless in the space of ten years is\nsomething that I would be significantly\n\n562\n00:29:29.309 --> 00:29:32.150\nconcerned about as\na security professional.\n\n563\n00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:36.750\nIf I had to safeguard that data and\nensure for my employers, for me, for\n\n564\n00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:39.064\nthose relying on that protection.\n\n565\n00:29:39.064 --> 00:29:40.694\nThat that data would stay secret,\n\n566\n00:29:40.694 --> 00:29:45.230\nwould stay protected through the natural\nretention period or lifetime of that data.\n\n567\n00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:49.225\nAnd so it's a lot of subtlety we've got to\nget into as we talk about cryptography.\n\n568\n00:29:49.225 --> 00:29:52.503\nThe history that we're gonna go through\non our next episode is gonna help you to\n\n569\n00:29:52.503 --> 00:29:55.533\nunderstand where we've come from and\nthe look ahead, that we're gonna\n\n570\n00:29:55.533 --> 00:29:59.140\ncontinue to engage in, is gonna help\nus understand where we're Boldly go.\n\n571\n00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:01.367\nAnd ultimately travel\ndown that road together.\n\n572\n00:30:01.367 --> 00:30:04.546\n&gt;&gt; Well I'm super excited because there\nis quite an interesting history with\n\n573\n00:30:04.546 --> 00:30:05.260\ncryptography.\n\n574\n00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:08.695\nAnd a lot of these algorithms they need\nto get analyzed for their relevance.\n\n575\n00:30:08.695 --> 00:30:12.443\nLike Adam was mentioning, sometimes\nthey'll have different standards every so\n\n576\n00:30:12.443 --> 00:30:13.646\noften, every few years.\n\n577\n00:30:13.646 --> 00:30:17.415\nBut there's a lot to learn, there's\na lot more behind, on the back scene.\n\n578\n00:30:17.415 --> 00:30:21.142\nSo stay tuned, and we're gonna go ahead\nand explain that in upcoming shows.\n\n579\n00:30:21.142 --> 00:30:23.586\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nsign out for this episode.\n\n580\n00:30:23.586 --> 00:30:25.693\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n581\n00:30:25.693 --> 00:30:28.017\n&gt;&gt; That' would be me,\nI'm Adam Gordon, hello.\n\n582\n00:30:28.017 --> 00:30:30.339\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] See you next time,\nhere at ITProTV.\n\n583\n00:30:30.339 -->

Francisco,\n\n3\n00:00:05.356 --> 00:00:06.980\nCalifornia [CROSSTALK].\n\n4\n00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.327\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.327 --> 00:00:12.050\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.790\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your ECES series.\n\n7\n00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.660\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.480\nIn the previous episode,\nwe were introduced to the concept of\n\n9\n00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.630\ncryptography and\na lot of the fundamentals.\n\n10\n00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.930\nBut in this episode we're gonna\ndelve deeper down that rabbit hole.\n\n11\n00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.400\nAnd with us today we have Mr.\nAdam Gordon in studios.\n\n12\n00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.020\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n13\n00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.710\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\nhopefully everybody's doing well.\n\n14\n00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.110\nAlways glad to be here.\n\n15\n00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.190\nAnd glad to be able to talk about\nencryption and rabbit holes.\n\n16\n00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.680\nWe're gonna somehow make that connection.\n\n17\n00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.650\nI'm not quite sure how but\nwe're gonna figure that out as we go.\n\n18\n00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.900\nSo let's talk a little bit\nmore about encryption,\n\n19\n00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.130\ncryptography, decryption, specifically\nlet's focus on some of the history.\n\n20\n00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.100\nI love talking about history,\nas I'm sure a lot of you do.\n\n21\n00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.250\nIt's always fun to look backwards, figure\nout where we've come from, look ahead,\n\n22\n00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.690\nfigure out where we're going.\n\n23\n00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.680\nBut when we talk about\nthe history of cryptography and\n\n24\n00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.470\nwe look at some of the ciphers or\nthe crypto systems that have gone before,\n\n25\n00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.270\nit's kind of interesting to go back and\nplay with and tinker with and\n\n26\n00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.130\nunderstand the mechanics of how some of\nthese earlier systems may have worked.\n\n27\n00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.324\nYou have a list of different\nconcepts that we can go through.\n\n28\n00:01:10.324 --> 00:01:14.402\nThere was something called\nthe monoalphabetic substitution cipher, or\n\n29\n00:01:14.402 --> 00:01:15.810\na series of these.\n\n30\n00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.733\nMono meaning one, right?\n\n31\n00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:21.353\nAnd alphabet, well, that's the series of\nletters and or the series of letters and\n\n32\n00:01:21.353 --> 00:01:25.930\nnumbers in some respects, depending on\nthe kind of system that we would use.\n\n33\n00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.580\nAnd so essentially these\nare single-alphabet ciphers.\n\n34\n00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.460\nWe would use one alphabet made up of,\nlet's say, in English letters A through Z.\n\n35\n00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.340\nIn a different language the equivalent\nof what those letters would have been or\n\n36\n00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.740\nthe representation of symbols\nthat would equal the letters or\n\n37\n00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.770\nthe ability to communicate\nin that language.\n\n38\n00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.008\nSo a single alphabet cipher,\nand there's four or\n\n39\n00:01:45.008 --> 00:01:47.312\nfive different examples\nhistorically we look at.\n\n40\n00:01:47.312 --> 00:01:49.370\nWanna run through them with you quickly.\n\n41\n00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.090\nThings like Atbash, Caesar ciphers,\nthe ROT13 cipher, that's always a fun one.\n\n42\n00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.020\nDaniel loves going on and\non about that one.\n\n43\n00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.760\nThe Scytale cipher, these are all\nexamples of monoalphabetic ciphers.\n\n44\n00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.840\nSo when we think of single-alphabet\nciphers and we think about something like\n\n45\n00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.960\nAtbash, which is one of the very earliest\ncipher systems we see in this area.\n\n46\n00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.670\nThis was used by scribes that were copying\n\n47\n00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.080\nancient Hebrew text actually, which is\nwhere we see this come from historically.\n\n48\n00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.190\nAnd as a result, it's a very simple\nsystem by today's standards.\n\n49\n00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.560\nYou've got to keep in mind that the filter\nthat we use to look back on this stuff\n\n50\n00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.570\nis perhaps several thousand years,\nin terms of the extended time line.\n\n51\n00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.550\nThis goes back to some of the earliest\nwritten records in terms of\n\n52\n00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.270\nthe original written records of the sages\nthat would have been writing down and\n\n53\n00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.760\ncreating the Jewish bible, the Hebrew\nbible, right, back thousands of years ago.\n\n54\n00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.360\nAnd the way they would have done this.\n\n55\n00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.420\nAnd so, this is gonna be a system that,\nto us, by today's standards\n\n56\n00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.710\nprobably sounds incredibly simplistic and\ndoesn't even make sense.\n\n57\n00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.830\nBecause we could look at that and\ngo, well, duh, right?\n\n58\n00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.420\nAll you do is just reverse the alphabet.\n\n59\n00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.964\nOf course, we could figure that out.\n\n60\n00:02:57.964 --> 00:03:01.048\n&gt;&gt; Well, Adam, when I was in middle\nschool, I thought it was really a smart\n\n61\n00:03:01.048 --> 00:03:03.881\nthing to do to keep my notes secret\nfrom anyone who would go ahead and\n\n62\n00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:05.971\nintersect them,\nlike the boys or the teachers.\n\n63\n00:03:05.971 --> 00:03:07.260\nBut you know, who knows?\n\n64\n00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.158\n&gt;&gt; Using this?\n\n65\n00:03:08.158 --> 00:03:09.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n66\n00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.250\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so reversing in other words,\n\n67\n00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.550\nthe letters you would\nessentially write it backwards?\n\n68\n00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So that's exactly what we would\n\n69\n00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.030\ndo, right?\n\n70\n00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.380\nAnd so with Atbash you're just taking\nthe alphabet and inverting it.\n\n71\n00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.680\nSo if we use English, and we say a, b, c,\nd, just in the normal chronological order\n\n72\n00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.720\nof our lettering system,\na would now become z, right?\n\n73\n00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.048\nAnd b would become y, and you could kind\nof invert that and go all the way through.\n\n74\n00:03:33.048 --> 00:03:36.798\nAnd so then as you wrote your notes or\ncommunicated, right, you would write\n\n75\n00:03:36.798 --> 00:03:40.916\nwhat seemed to be random, scrambled\nnonsense, it didn't make sense to anybody.\n\n76\n00:03:40.916 --> 00:03:41.752\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No one could figure this out.\n\n77\n00:03:41.752 --> 00:03:43.884\n&gt;&gt; Right, so the boys especially,\nand to the teachers, right?\n\n78\n00:03:43.884 --> 00:03:45.968\nSo when you wrote about\nthe boys they didn't know, and\n\n79\n00:03:45.968 --> 00:03:48.715\nteachers didn't know you were\nwriting about the boys either.\n\n80\n00:03:48.715 --> 00:03:52.915\nBut when you do that, then obviously if\nyou understand that and flip it around,\n\n81\n00:03:52.915 --> 00:03:55.965\nright, so your friends could read it or\nwhoever you were communicating with, not\n\n82\n00:03:55.965 --> 00:03:59.450\nthe boys, obviously, but everybody else\nthen they would know what Cherokee wrote.\n\n83\n00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.802\nGeorge is cute or something like that or\nwhatever it would have been.\n\n84\n00:04:02.802 --> 00:04:05.942\nAnd it would have looked not like George\nis cute, but it would have been obviously\n\n85\n00:04:05.942 --> 00:04:10.555\nshifted right, as we would say, or\ntransposed and essentially flipped over.\n\n86\n00:04:10.555 --> 00:04:14.721\nSo Atbash is merely just the idea of\ninverting the alphabet, starting from\n\n87\n00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:17.711\nthe back and working forward,\ninstead of starting from the front and\n\n88\n00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:21.611\nworking to the end, given\nthe chronological or linear progression of\n\n89\n00:04:21.611 --> 00:04:25.989\nthose letters in whatever ordered series\nthey would normally be presented in.\n\n90\n00:04:25.989 --> 00:04:30.162\nThe Caesar cipher is going to allow us,\nagain, to think through the logic of\n\n91\n00:04:30.162 --> 00:04:34.817\nshifting something, essentially what many,\nif not all, of these approaches do.\n\n92\n00:04:34.817 --> 00:04:36.500\n&gt;&gt; To transpose those characters?\n\n93\n00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.770\n&gt;&gt; To shift or transpose,\nessentially the same idea.\n\n94\n00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.550\nWe're gonna choose some number,\nessentially a count if you will,\n\n95\n00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.350\nthat we're gonna shift each\nletter of the message by.\n\n96\n00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:51.530\nAnd so we represent this by writing it\nout as a shorthand sequence if you will.\n\n97\n00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.100\nIf you wanna take a look at my screen for\n\n98\n00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.190\njust a sec,\nI'm gonna show you something real quick.\n\n99\n00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.020\nSet up just a little example for you.\n\n100\n00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.680\nSo in an Caesar cipher, we would\nsay we wanna use either the plus or\n\n101\n00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.650\nthe minus, and then a numerical\nvalue to represent the shift, right?\n\n102\n00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.720\nAnd so we see this is for multi-alphabet\nciphers, so we're gonna get to them in\n\n103\n00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.920\na couple of minutes, but the concept is\nthe same in terms of explaining the logic.\n\n104\n00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.350\nYou could see that we represent either\na plus or a minus value, right?\n\n105\n00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.958\nSo you can see that, and\nwhat we do is say +1, so\n\n106\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.697\nthat would mean shift by one letter.\n\n107\n00:05:24.697 --> 00:05:28.810\n-2, shift by one letter, or excuse me,\nshift by two letters, but shift back.\n\n108\n00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.588\nWhen we use the plus we go to the right or\ngo forward in the language,\n\n109\n00:05:32.588 --> 00:05:34.260\nwe just assume we go left to right.\n\n110\n00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.030\nAnd when we use the minus, we shift,\nbut we go to the left, or go backwards.\n\n111\n00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.890\nSo the idea would be the notation\nwould allow us to understand\n\n112\n00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.860\nhow many places we are shifting and\nin what direction.\n\n113\n00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.456\nAnd so as a result, right,\nwe would say A + 2, and\n\n114\n00:05:50.456 --> 00:05:55.337\nA + 2 would equal C in English,\nbecause we're jumping two spaces.\n\n115\n00:05:55.337 --> 00:05:59.340\nSo after A, right, comes B,\nand then C, right?\n\n116\n00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.900\nSo if we did something like this where\nwe said A, and then did + 2, right?\n\n117\n00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.550\nJust to short hand for notation.\n\n118\n00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.738\nWhat that really would equal is A, B, C.\n\n119\n00:06:09.738 --> 00:06:13.340\nAnd we're shifting by two places, right?\n\n120\n00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.984\nAnd so if we start with A and\nwe shift two places,\n\n121\n00:06:16.984 --> 00:06:21.449\njust highlight B and C,\nwe wind up with with an A + two, and\n\n122\n00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:26.667\nthe Caesar ciphers being the equivalent\nof the letter C in English.\n\n123\n00:06:26.667 --> 00:06:31.375\nNow obviously, this was done not in\nEnglish, but done in Roman, first of all.\n\n124\n00:06:31.375 --> 00:06:32.525\nAnd second of all,\n\n125\n00:06:32.525 --> 00:06:35.175\nthe numbering system would obviously\nalso have looked different.\n\n126\n00:06:35.175 --> 00:06:36.165\nBut the point is,\n\n127\n00:06:36.165 --> 00:06:40.245\nwhen we translate it into the modern day,\nthe equivalent is the same, right?\n\n128\n00:06:40.245 --> 00:06:43.705\nAnd so, a Caesar cipher is this\nidea of understanding the shift.\n\n129\n00:06:43.705 --> 00:06:46.960\nIf we did C minus 1, right?\n\n130\n00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.336\nThen what we would do here,\njust to make another note, if we did C- 1.\n\n131\n00:06:52.336 --> 00:06:57.188\nWhat that would equal is,\nstarting with C, right,\n\n132\n00:06:57.188 --> 00:07:00.800\nand then going backwards one to B.\n\n133\n00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:06.000\nAnd -1 means that B would be the one that\nwe actually use as the substitution for\n\n134\n00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.250\nthat particular letter in the cipher\nas we start writing out the message.\n\n135\n00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.630\n&gt;&gt; Now if we add the plus 1 wouldn't\nit kind of equal itself out there?\n\n136\n00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:19.730\n&gt;&gt; No, so if we do plus 1,\nlet's do D plus 1, right?\n\n137\n00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:21.930\nWhat you're doing is starting from D,\nso A, B, C, D, right?\n\n138\n00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:23.300\nAnd then what do you do?\n\n139\n00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.280\nYou add one.\n\n140\n00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.280\nSo after D comes E, right?\n\n141\n00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.450\nSo we would start with D just to\nknow that we're adding 1, right?\n\n142\n00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:30.292\nSo think of it this way.\n\n143\n00:07:30.292 --> 00:07:33.240\nD + 1 is really D, right?\n\n144\n00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.310\nAnd then we move 1 to the right and\nwe wind up with E.\n\n145\n00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.590\nThis is always the starting point, right?\n\n146\n00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.040\nAnd then whatever we do if we're,\n\n147\n00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.260\nyou don't really write it out\nthis way to figure it out.\n\n148\n00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.380\nI'm just starting with the,\nI'm putting the starting point there so\n\n149\n00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.650\nyou can see we're adding\nthose two places to show you.\n\n150\n00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:52.580\nBut, what we would say\nis D + 1 just equals E.\n\n151\n00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.223\nBecause we would know we\nshift by 1 to the right.\n\n152\n00:07:55.223 --> 00:07:59.390\nBut we would always add from the starting\npoint the original letter we use,\n\n153\n00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:03.692\nwhatever number follows the plus or\nminus, would be added or removed And that\n\n154\n00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:08.410\nsequential variation is where we land,\nand that's ultimately what we then use.\n\n155\n00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:09.170\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n156\n00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:10.620\n&gt;&gt; So that is the Caesar cipher.\n\n157\n00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.838\nThat's how we would do the Caesar cipher,\nokay?\n\n158\n00:08:12.838 --> 00:08:13.995\nWhat about ROT13?\n\n159\n00:08:13.995 --> 00:08:15.670\nThis is another popular one.\n\n160\n00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:17.350\nA lot of people talk about it.\n\n161\n00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:20.510\nYou got little software programs out there\nthat let you play with all these and\n\n162\n00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:21.350\nfigure out how they work.\n\n163\n00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.641\nWe're gonna actually do a cool demo for\nyou and\n\n164\n00:08:23.641 --> 00:08:26.595\nshow you what that looks like\nusing a tool called CrypTool.\n\n165\n00:08:26.595 --> 00:08:28.220\nThat we'll take a look at at some point.\n\n166\n00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:32.091\n&gt;&gt; Now, Adam, the name for this one\nseems pretty self-explanatory, rot,\n\n167\n00:08:32.091 --> 00:08:33.571\nrotate to the 13th level.\n\n168\n00:08:33.571 --> 00:08:35.335\nAre we looking at that or 13 shifts?\n\n169\n00:08:35.335 --> 00:08:37.352\n&gt;&gt; Characters or letters.\n\n170\n00:08:37.352 --> 00:08:38.224\n&gt;&gt; Characters, there we go.\n\n171\n00:08:38.224 --> 00:08:41.870\n&gt;&gt; So ROT13 is just short for\nrotate, as Cherokee was saying.\n\n172\n00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:45.280\nRotate in this case dash 13, 13 places.\n\n173\n00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.195\nYou could do ROT10.\n\n174\n00:08:46.195 --> 00:08:47.302\nYou could do ROT15.\n\n175\n00:08:47.302 --> 00:08:50.787\nThe idea is just how far down\nthe line sequentially and\n\n176\n00:08:50.787 --> 00:08:54.110\nlinearly do we rotate it essentially or\nshift.\n\n177\n00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:58.105\nSo ROT13 rotates all characters\n13 letters through the alphabet.\n\n178\n00:08:58.105 --> 00:09:03.053\nSo the idea is that, again if we're\nusing English as our starting point\n\n179\n00:09:03.053 --> 00:09:05.938\nIf you start with the letter a and\nrotate or\n\n180\n00:09:05.938 --> 00:09:11.190\ntranspose by shifting down 13 characters,\na becomes n and b becomes o.\n\n181\n00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:15.795\nAnd so you'd walk through the alphabet\nshifting 13 places as you go.\n\n182\n00:09:15.795 --> 00:09:19.469\nAnd then that becomes the key that\nallows you to then do the transposition,\n\n183\n00:09:19.469 --> 00:09:22.388\nand ultimately,\ndo the encryption and decryption.\n\n184\n00:09:22.388 --> 00:09:26.250\nSo ROT13 ciphers are simply\nshifting the entire alphabet\n\n185\n00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:28.850\n13 places off the starting point.\n\n186\n00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.481\nThe trick is, of course,\nif you start not with a, but\n\n187\n00:09:31.481 --> 00:09:35.355\nstart somewhere in the middle and do\nthe shift, you can vary that first of all.\n\n188\n00:09:35.355 --> 00:09:39.682\nSecond of all, without knowing where\nthe starting point was for the shift,\n\n189\n00:09:39.682 --> 00:09:42.859\nessentially knowing the key if you will,\nit's hard for\n\n190\n00:09:42.859 --> 00:09:45.440\nsomebody to do the overlay and\nfigure it out.\n\n191\n00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.147\nBut because there's only 26\nletters in the English alphabet,\n\n192\n00:09:48.147 --> 00:09:51.342\nif they put a little bit of time and\neffort in, they could do the transposition\n\n193\n00:09:51.342 --> 00:09:54.020\nwith each letter figuring out\nwhere you started the shift from.\n\n194\n00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.532\nIn the old days, hundreds,\nthousands of years ago,\n\n195\n00:09:57.532 --> 00:10:01.040\nclearly this was a very\nperson intensive effort.\n\n196\n00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.370\nYou had to sit for hours.\n\n197\n00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:05.929\nPerhaps groups of people sat for hours and\nthey had to manually work all this out.\n\n198\n00:10:05.929 --> 00:10:09.800\nThis was literally paper and\npencil or the equivalent, right?\n\n199\n00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.109\nTrying to scratch through all this.\n\n200\n00:10:11.109 --> 00:10:14.767\nToday, you plug this into a computer and\nwithin a few seconds for\n\n201\n00:10:14.767 --> 00:10:17.560\none of these basic ciphers,\nyou get the answer.\n\n202\n00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:22.068\nBecause a computer taking each letter\nin the alphabet, doing the shift 13,\n\n203\n00:10:22.068 --> 00:10:23.444\nin the case of ROT13.\n\n204\n00:10:23.444 --> 00:10:26.203\nAnd figuring out what that\nmessage looks like and\n\n205\n00:10:26.203 --> 00:10:30.722\nwhere you started is one of the most basic\nfunctions the computer can engage in.\n\n206\n00:10:30.722 --> 00:10:34.703\nAnd the computer is gonna be\nthe equivalent of thousands of individual\n\n207\n00:10:34.703 --> 00:10:39.170\npeople working on this simultaneously,\nright, from a timing perspective.\n\n208\n00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:43.060\nSo, it does, obviously,\nnot stand up to the test of time.\n\n209\n00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:48.630\nThese algorithms, these approaches, these\ncryptography solutions or substitution\n\n210\n00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:54.580\ncyphers that we talk about are very old\nschool, literally, oldest old school.\n\n211\n00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.915\nAnd while they're fun to talk about,\nthey're not practical to use if you\n\n212\n00:10:57.915 --> 00:11:00.670\nwanna protect information in\nany meaningful way today.\n\n213\n00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:03.870\nThey may be fun to play with in school\nlike Erica was suggesting, they're great\n\n214\n00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:07.670\nto get kids interested in cryptography\nbecause they're very rudimentary.\n\n215\n00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:10.470\nSo they're easy to understand and\nto work with.\n\n216\n00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:15.230\nAnd so it's great as an approachable to\ntrain and to get people interested in.\n\n217\n00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:19.330\nBut for real practical\ncryptographic protection today,\n\n218\n00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:22.610\nthere's really no value in these\ncuz they're so easily broken.\n\n219\n00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:26.370\nThat there's just no benefit to using them\nunless you wanted people to actually find\n\n220\n00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:27.410\nthe information.\n\n221\n00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:30.310\nIn which case, then, maybe, obviously,\nthere is a little bit of value there.\n\n222\n00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.983\nSo we have ROT13.\n\n223\n00:11:30.983 --> 00:11:32.542\nWe also have the scytale cipher.\n\n224\n00:11:32.542 --> 00:11:36.514\nOne of Cherokee's favorites because now\nshe knows how to pronounce it properly.\n\n225\n00:11:36.514 --> 00:11:38.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So the scytale cipher.\n\n226\n00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:42.635\nSo I know you were asking me a little\nbit before we came on about the scytale\n\n227\n00:11:42.635 --> 00:11:43.300\ncipher.\n\n228\n00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.180\nWe talked about how it works.\n\n229\n00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:49.870\nBut the idea of really being able to use a\npre-measured rod or a staff or a stick or\n\n230\n00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:53.520\nwhatever you would have laying around,\nand you would take that.\n\n231\n00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:57.480\nSo essentially, maybe it was,\na two foot long staff.\n\n232\n00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.544\nYou would chop it to\nthe length you wanted it.\n\n233\n00:11:59.544 --> 00:12:03.711\nYou would then take either a piece\nof papyrus or perhaps leather or\n\n234\n00:12:03.711 --> 00:12:09.310\nsome sort of fabric linen, whatever it was\nthat you had written the message out on.\n\n235\n00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:12.020\nAnd you would wrap it\nliterally cylindrically, so\n\n236\n00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.609\nyou would just circle\nthe rod wrapping as you go.\n\n237\n00:12:14.609 --> 00:12:17.880\nSo the edges essentially would match up,\nright?\n\n238\n00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:18.530\nWe don't wanna have overlap.\n\n239\n00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:19.504\nThat would be the one thing.\n\n240\n00:12:19.504 --> 00:12:24.892\nAnd then when you do that, you would\nthen have this stream of characters that\n\n241\n00:12:24.892 --> 00:12:31.410\nwere laid out across the various areas, or\nthe circumference of the staff or the rod.\n\n242\n00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:34.540\nAnd by turning to the appropriate\narea where you could then\n\n243\n00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:38.480\nexenterate the message from,\nthat would be the string essentially.\n\n244\n00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.900\nThink of it as a row, right,\nthat you would use to create the message.\n\n245\n00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:46.840\nAnd then the trick was, you would have\nto take that exact length of material,\n\n246\n00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.127\nleather or felt, whatever it was.\n\n247\n00:12:49.127 --> 00:12:51.559\nYou have to take that staff,\nthat exact length, and\n\n248\n00:12:51.559 --> 00:12:54.915\nreproduce it at the side where\nyou're sending the message.\n\n249\n00:12:54.915 --> 00:12:57.181\nAnd,as a result, then,\nbe able to wrap it the right way.\n\n250\n00:12:57.181 --> 00:12:59.054\nStart from the top or\nstart from halfway down.\n\n251\n00:12:59.054 --> 00:13:02.834\nAgain, what all the variables are,\nthese are the secrets, right?\n\n252\n00:13:02.834 --> 00:13:04.570\nThe things that nobody knew.\n\n253\n00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:06.420\n&gt;&gt; Like the diameter of that staff.\n\n254\n00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.976\n&gt;&gt; The diameter would be important.\n\n255\n00:13:07.976 --> 00:13:11.600\nThe length of the staff,\nhow far down the staff you chose to start.\n\n256\n00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:15.657\nSo they would have to somehow mark\nthe starting point inconspicuously.\n\n257\n00:13:15.657 --> 00:13:20.154\nSo they would notch it or perhaps put some\nsort of mark on it or maybe they would\n\n258\n00:13:20.154 --> 00:13:24.750\nwrap leather on it as a walking stick,\nwhich was common, right, to grab it.\n\n259\n00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:27.997\nBut then you would know you would start\nfrom halfway down the leather binding or\n\n260\n00:13:27.997 --> 00:13:28.841\nwhatever they did.\n\n261\n00:13:28.841 --> 00:13:33.420\nBut the point was somebody had to transmit\nthis in a way that was not obvious.\n\n262\n00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.753\nSo if you were going through enemy\nterritory and they stopped you on\n\n263\n00:13:36.753 --> 00:13:40.338\nthe road and said, hey, that's a nice\nstaff, where did you get that?\n\n264\n00:13:40.338 --> 00:13:43.246\nAnd they said, you're probably\na messenger, we're gonna take that.\n\n265\n00:13:43.246 --> 00:13:46.730\nAnd they found perhaps a strip of cloth or\nwhatever,\n\n266\n00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:51.655\nthe people that found you may not still\nknow how to reproduce the message.\n\n267\n00:13:51.655 --> 00:13:53.685\nCuz maybe they didn't know\nwhere on the staff or\n\n268\n00:13:53.685 --> 00:13:55.155\nthey didn't know where on the strip.\n\n269\n00:13:55.155 --> 00:13:57.235\nAnd there are all these variables\nyou had to account for.\n\n270\n00:13:57.235 --> 00:13:59.515\nBut ultimately, yeah, it was the diameter.\n\n271\n00:13:59.515 --> 00:14:00.785\nIt was the length.\n\n272\n00:14:00.785 --> 00:14:03.565\nIt was a lot of things that today,\nagain, we don't stop and\n\n273\n00:14:03.565 --> 00:14:04.645\nthink about this stuff, right?\n\n274\n00:14:04.645 --> 00:14:08.565\nWho stops and says, yeah, the\ncircumference of the rod and the length\n\n275\n00:14:08.565 --> 00:14:12.690\nand starting point would all be factors\nin how we would create this message.\n\n276\n00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:13.527\n&gt;&gt; Somebody thought about it.\n\n277\n00:14:13.527 --> 00:14:16.944\n&gt;&gt; Somebody did and\nback in that time period, I mean,\n\n278\n00:14:16.944 --> 00:14:22.090\nthis was cutting edge super spy,\nJames Bond, secret kinda stuff.\n\n279\n00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:26.050\nMy god, you've got this thing and you're\ngonna send it and nobody's gonna know.\n\n280\n00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:30.938\nAt the time, this was, literally,\nan unbreakable cryptosystem in the day.\n\n281\n00:14:30.938 --> 00:14:34.518\nBecause if you were captured,\nyou broke the rod in half or\n\n282\n00:14:34.518 --> 00:14:37.958\ntore up the piece of whatever or-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, burn it up.\n\n283\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.293\n&gt;&gt; Right, or whatever you did.\n\n284\n00:14:39.293 --> 00:14:41.758\nNobody could reproduce it unless they\ntortured you and you gave it to them.\n\n285\n00:14:41.758 --> 00:14:43.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You didn't know.\n\n286\n00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:46.230\nSo the point is you didn't\nwant to be the messenger.\n\n287\n00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:47.996\nCuz that was probably\na very dangerous job.\n\n288\n00:14:47.996 --> 00:14:49.212\nAnd you were likely to get killed, right?\n\n289\n00:14:49.212 --> 00:14:50.794\n&gt;&gt; I wonder what the saying\nwas before guns.\n\n290\n00:14:50.794 --> 00:14:51.917\nDon't shoot the messenger.\n\n291\n00:14:51.917 --> 00:14:53.241\nThey must've had some\nother kind of saying.\n\n292\n00:14:53.241 --> 00:14:55.923\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Probably something, right, or\n\n293\n00:14:55.923 --> 00:14:58.868\nmaybe don't shoot the messenger that comes\nfrom them, because if you shot them,\n\n294\n00:14:58.868 --> 00:15:00.590\nyou couldn't figure out\nwhat the message was.\n\n295\n00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:03.231\nIf you think about it, right, you\nneeded them alive to actually tell you.\n\n296\n00:15:03.231 --> 00:15:06.455\nSo this was kinda cool, and\nif you give me just one second here and\n\n297\n00:15:06.455 --> 00:15:08.610\nI actually will show you something.\n\n298\n00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:11.418\nJust one sec,\ncuz I have something else up and running.\n\n299\n00:15:11.418 --> 00:15:12.664\nBut let me just show you.\n\n300\n00:15:12.664 --> 00:15:15.010\nLet me just do a quick Google search here.\n\n301\n00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:18.394\nIf we do Scytale Cipher, and\nbefore we go to my machine,\n\n302\n00:15:18.394 --> 00:15:22.289\nyou can look at me looking down and\nnot at you for just one second.\n\n303\n00:15:22.289 --> 00:15:25.250\nBut let me just do this, I’m just gonna\nbring up a Google search for images.\n\n304\n00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:27.019\nYou could actually see a picture\nof what this looks like.\n\n305\n00:15:27.019 --> 00:15:28.760\nCould we go to my machine for a second?\n\n306\n00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.480\nThis is what we’re talking about, right?\n\n307\n00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:34.495\nSo, something like this, where you\nwould’ve had some sort of a staff or,\n\n308\n00:15:34.495 --> 00:15:38.253\nas you could see, and we wrap a string or\nsome sort of strip of leather,\n\n309\n00:15:38.253 --> 00:15:39.884\nwhatever it would have been.\n\n310\n00:15:39.884 --> 00:15:43.330\nPapyrus, as I said,\nsomething like that back then, around it.\n\n311\n00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.707\nAnd you could see that how they wrap it,\nthis one's a good example.\n\n312\n00:15:46.707 --> 00:15:52.840\nTroops, something like send more\ntroops to Southern flank and whatever.\n\n313\n00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:56.551\nBased on the wrapping the, obviously\nthe words line up and the letters line up.\n\n314\n00:15:56.551 --> 00:15:59.850\nBut if you wrapped it incorrectly,\nit wouldn't line up.\n\n315\n00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:02.377\nAnd at the time, as I said,\nthis is pretty ingenious stuff.\n\n316\n00:16:02.377 --> 00:16:07.271\nI mean Today we look at that and go yeah,\nright, that's like a child's toy.\n\n317\n00:16:07.271 --> 00:16:08.899\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, I mean,\n\n318\n00:16:08.899 --> 00:16:11.486\nit's like a Rubik's Cube but\njust for words.\n\n319\n00:16:11.486 --> 00:16:14.290\nBut back then,\nthis would have been revolutionary.\n\n320\n00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:16.850\nI mean, this really would\nhave changed the ability for\n\n321\n00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:21.320\nus to communicate successfully because\nwithout having all that detail,\n\n322\n00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.280\nthere really wouldn't have been a good\nway for you to reproduce this message.\n\n323\n00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.190\nAnd it's not like you\nwere playing telephone.\n\n324\n00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:29.530\nYou were sending it to somebody who may or\nmay not transcribe it correctly.\n\n325\n00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:34.825\nYou were sending it in written form, but\nif you secreted this strip of Papyrus or\n\n326\n00:16:34.825 --> 00:16:39.755\nthe strip of linen or whatever it was\ninto maybe the hemline of your clothes or\n\n327\n00:16:39.755 --> 00:16:42.175\nin a hat or something,\nit was secreted away.\n\n328\n00:16:42.175 --> 00:16:46.075\nAnd nobody found it and you just have\nthis piece of wood or whatever it would\n\n329\n00:16:46.075 --> 00:16:50.015\nhave been that may seem to the average\nbystander to just be random.\n\n330\n00:16:50.015 --> 00:16:50.725\n&gt;&gt; Normal, yeah.\n\n331\n00:16:50.725 --> 00:16:53.445\n&gt;&gt; Right, I mean maybe you're driving\nan ox cart full of wood because\n\n332\n00:16:53.445 --> 00:16:54.945\nthat's what you're doing and\n\n333\n00:16:54.945 --> 00:16:58.070\nsomewhere in there is a stick that\nactually translates the message.\n\n334\n00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:00.360\nHow would you know there's\na thousand sticks on the cart.\n\n335\n00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.640\nThink about the logic of it.\n\n336\n00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.485\nHide in plain sight.\n\n337\n00:17:02.485 --> 00:17:03.870\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Who's going to figure out\n\n338\n00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:06.800\nwhich stick it is, right,\nas long as you don't have a need\n\n339\n00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.440\nto burn all the sticks before you get to\nwhere you're going, you're probably okay.\n\n340\n00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.870\nBut yet, there would be so\nmany ways to secret this information\n\n341\n00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:17.050\nin such a way that nobody, in theory,\nwould find it that you know, at the time.\n\n342\n00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:20.610\nThis is perhaps not today\ncutting edge technology.\n\n343\n00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:23.890\nThe reality is it is\ncertainly a very impressive\n\n344\n00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:27.940\nuse of technology in the context of\nthat time period, if you think about it.\n\n345\n00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:29.230\nSo, it's kinda interesting.\n\n346\n00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.110\nThe idea is that really,\nall of these single alphabet,\n\n347\n00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:37.230\nall these single substitutions ciphers,\nthese monoalphabetic ciphers,\n\n348\n00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:40.220\nwhat they really were doing was\ntrying to preserve the message.\n\n349\n00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.596\nBut the key downfall of these systems,\n\n350\n00:17:42.596 --> 00:17:46.413\nthe weakness that really led to\nall of them being compromised,\n\n351\n00:17:46.413 --> 00:17:50.951\nnot just to modern technology, but\nthe ability to understand that certain\n\n352\n00:17:50.951 --> 00:17:55.651\nletters will reproduce themselves with\ncertain frequencies and language.\n\n353\n00:17:55.651 --> 00:17:56.620\n&gt;&gt; Pattern recognition.\n\n354\n00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:59.450\n&gt;&gt; Not so much pattern recognition,\nwe call it actually frequency analysis.\n\n355\n00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:00.280\n&gt;&gt; Frequency analysis.\n\n356\n00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:05.480\n&gt;&gt; So, pattern recognition is the idea of\nlooking for the next step in frequency\n\n357\n00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:10.120\nanalysis which is how many letters\nreproduce themselves at a certain\n\n358\n00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:15.965\nfrequency in the modern, let's say English\nlanguage or in German or French or Roman.\n\n359\n00:18:15.965 --> 00:18:18.658\nBack in the day,\nyou would use a, for instance,\n\n360\n00:18:18.658 --> 00:18:20.710\nin English a lot more than you use 1.\n\n361\n00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:24.570\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like playing Wheel of Fortune\nwhenever goes for those coveted letters,\n\n362\n00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:26.580\nfor what is it, R S T L E.\n\n363\n00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.810\n&gt;&gt; You would expect the most,\nright, in most words,\n\n364\n00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:30.260\nyou would have multiples, right?\n\n365\n00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:34.490\nAnd so there's actually scientific studies\nthat have been done to look at frequency\n\n366\n00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:35.580\npatterns of language.\n\n367\n00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.560\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And all modern languages have\n\n368\n00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.805\nhad this analysis done\n&gt;&gt; You could go out and google them,\n\n369\n00:18:39.805 --> 00:18:41.665\nand find information on them.\n\n370\n00:18:41.665 --> 00:18:43.305\nCryptographers know about all this,\n\n371\n00:18:43.305 --> 00:18:46.375\nit's programmed into all\nthe cryptography software we use today.\n\n372\n00:18:46.375 --> 00:18:49.035\nSo we use it as part of\nthe tool set to figure out, and\n\n373\n00:18:49.035 --> 00:18:52.815\nbreak certain approaches to cryptography.\n\n374\n00:18:52.815 --> 00:18:54.715\nAnd then we can look for\npatterns as a result.\n\n375\n00:18:54.715 --> 00:18:57.935\nSo when you take plain text,\nthe dog is blue,\n\n376\n00:18:57.935 --> 00:19:01.540\nyou have the letter e reproduced\ntwice in there, right.\n\n377\n00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.280\nThe and blue, right.\n\n378\n00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:07.764\nSo you would see that when we go from\nplain text thru the crypto system,\n\n379\n00:19:07.764 --> 00:19:12.552\nthru the encryption algorithm and key,\nto the cipher text on the backend,\n\n380\n00:19:12.552 --> 00:19:15.364\nthat the letter e would get reproduced,\nand\n\n381\n00:19:15.364 --> 00:19:18.785\nwould not necessarily be\nthe same as that character.\n\n382\n00:19:18.785 --> 00:19:22.449\nBut would be frequently produced\nmore than any other letter and so\n\n383\n00:19:22.449 --> 00:19:25.456\nwe can begin to tear apart\nthe cypher text [CROSSTALK].\n\n384\n00:19:25.456 --> 00:19:27.702\n&gt;&gt; I didn't even know I\nwas using this concept.\n\n385\n00:19:27.702 --> 00:19:31.270\nWhenever NSA you have Crypto Challenge,\nit's an app you can download on your\n\n386\n00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:35.290\nphone, go figure, and I always look for\nthose words like the, is, at,\n\n387\n00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:39.500\nlike little small words and\nthen kind of build upon those.\n\n388\n00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:41.360\n&gt;&gt; And that's one way of doing it.\n\n389\n00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.650\nIt's not exactly frequency analysis.\n\n390\n00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:45.150\nIt is more of a pattern.\n\n391\n00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:48.760\nAnalysis or recognition but\nthey're kind of linked together.\n\n392\n00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:49.350\nYou must do and\n\n393\n00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:52.790\nunderstand the frequency to really be\nable to then use the pattern concept.\n\n394\n00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:56.494\nBut these are modern approaches that we\nuse, and this is one of the reasons why,\n\n395\n00:19:56.494 --> 00:20:00.922\nwhile these approaches made sense 1,000,\n2,000 years ago before everybody knew,\n\n396\n00:20:00.922 --> 00:20:02.597\nnumber one, how to read and write.\n\n397\n00:20:02.597 --> 00:20:04.444\nAnd the few people that\ndid know how to read and\n\n398\n00:20:04.444 --> 00:20:07.080\nwrite were really interested in\nsending their stuff securely.\n\n399\n00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:11.700\nAnd not so much interested in looking at\nthe frequency of letters and words, and\n\n400\n00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.500\ndidn't have computers to expose patterns.\n\n401\n00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.430\nThey had people toiling away,\n\n402\n00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:20.590\nright, by candle light writing things\ndown, hand copying everything.\n\n403\n00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:22.020\nYet it was a very different time and\n\n404\n00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:26.320\nas a result, the ability to understand\nthose patterns was very limited.\n\n405\n00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.820\nThe knowledge to understand language\nin general was very limited,\n\n406\n00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:31.250\nback at the time that\nthis stuff was happening.\n\n407\n00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:33.960\nMost people didn't know how to,\nthey would see this, and\n\n408\n00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.810\nthey didn't understand what it was,\ncuz they didn't know how to read.\n\n409\n00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:39.470\nThey just didn't understand and never been\ntaught from the time they were growing up.\n\n410\n00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:40.820\nNever taught how to read and write.\n\n411\n00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:43.970\nMost people then were illiterate by\nwhat would we would think of as today's\n\n412\n00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:44.880\nstandards.\n\n413\n00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.120\nAnd as a result, the average person,\n\n414\n00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.690\nthe average soldier probably\ndidn't know how to read and write.\n\n415\n00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:51.710\nOnly officers probably did, and\n\n416\n00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:55.610\neven then maybe not them, maybe just\nthe aristocrats essentially, right?\n\n417\n00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:59.440\nAnd as a result the majority of the people\nthat were intercepting this stuff and\n\n418\n00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.070\nseeing it probably didn't have a clue\nwhat it was They just didn't look,\n\n419\n00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:03.830\nthey looked at it and, I don't know.\n\n420\n00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:07.150\nIt looks like pictures or something,\nI'm not even sure what to call it.\n\n421\n00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:09.690\nSo they wouldn't even have known what\nthey were looking at more often than not,\n\n422\n00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:15.040\nwhich is one of the reasons that for so\nlong, these approaches worked so well.\n\n423\n00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.540\nBecause most people didn't\nunderstand what they were seeing,\n\n424\n00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:19.830\neven when they had seen that information.\n\n425\n00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:21.340\nThey couldn't reproduce it.\n\n426\n00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:24.240\nSomebody said, hey, you saw that paper,\ntell us what was on it.\n\n427\n00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.980\nYou don't know how to read and write.\n\n428\n00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.480\nThere was something I\nhave no idea what it was.\n\n429\n00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:28.970\nI couldn't even draw it for\n\n430\n00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:31.840\nyou even if I wanted to because\nI don't know where to begin.\n\n431\n00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.980\nIt's like you're looking at it, but\nyou're not seeing it in that respect.\n\n432\n00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:36.320\nSo it's kind of interesting.\n\n433\n00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:39.510\nWe move on to multi-alphabet\nsubstitution ciphers.\n\n434\n00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:41.000\nWe're adding multiple alphabets.\n\n435\n00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.330\nThe monoalphabetic ciphers are the ones\nthat use the single alphabet.\n\n436\n00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:49.280\nMulti-alphabet ciphers, we add\nmultiple rounds to the substitution.\n\n437\n00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:53.140\nSo we can go back to my machine here for\njust a second.\n\n438\n00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:55.640\nThis is the example I was going\nto look at with you before,\n\n439\n00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:59.360\nlet's just get rid of the stuff down here,\npretend it wasn't here for\n\n440\n00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:04.280\njust a second just so that we can\nmake it easy for us to focus on.\n\n441\n00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:08.870\nAnd let me just move this over,\never so slightly,\n\n442\n00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:11.390\nright there, just so\nwe can see it right on the edge.\n\n443\n00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:13.810\nAnd what you're looking at is the idea,\n\n444\n00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:17.040\njust an example to help us work\nthrough it, as I was suggesting.\n\n445\n00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.380\nIn this case we're going to use three\nalphabets, as I put up in the notes.\n\n446\n00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:23.200\nSo we're going to have three\nalphabets being used to run through\n\n447\n00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.700\nthe substitution,\nyou know our notation system, plus or\n\n448\n00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:28.100\nminus and a numerical model.\n\n449\n00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.130\nWe've been through that and\n\n450\n00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:32.210\ntalked about that with the Cesaer\ncipher in the single shift.\n\n451\n00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:36.080\nWhen we take the plain text a dog, right,\n\n452\n00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:40.970\njust as an example and we put our notation\nsequence to the right of it just in\n\n453\n00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:46.150\nthe parentheses just to tell us how\nwe're gonna do the shift +1, -2, +1.\n\n454\n00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:51.310\nThose are the three shifts, right, one for\neach alphabet, but we have four letters.\n\n455\n00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:54.250\nSo this now presents an interesting\nchallenge cuz we're not\n\n456\n00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:58.150\ngonna be able to have, we could do four\nalphabets, in theory that would work.\n\n457\n00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:02.230\nBut if we're doing three and we have more\nthan three letters to shift we now have to\n\n458\n00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:05.800\ndo what's called round robining,\nessentially go through one to three and\n\n459\n00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:09.710\nthen start back again and just keep\ngoing until we run out of letters.\n\n460\n00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:12.855\nAnd so a dog, being done in a mono or\n\n461\n00:23:12.855 --> 00:23:17.628\nmulti-alphabetic shift with\nthree alphabets, +1 -2,\n\n462\n00:23:17.628 --> 00:23:22.380\n+1, we would line up and essentially\nwhat we would do is the following.\n\n463\n00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:23.400\nLet me just go over here.\n\n464\n00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:29.880\nAnd so we would put +1 under A, right?\n\n465\n00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:34.940\nAnd that would be the shift for A and\nwhen we do +1, A plus 1 is what?\n\n466\n00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:36.930\nThat's B, right at the bottom.\n\n467\n00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:39.090\nUnder D, right?\n\n468\n00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:45.205\nWe would do, oops under D we would do-\n&gt;&gt; Minus the C.\n\n469\n00:23:45.205 --> 00:23:46.830\n&gt;&gt; Minus the 2, right?\n\n470\n00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:48.586\nLet's move that over.\n\n471\n00:23:48.586 --> 00:23:50.760\nWe would do the -2, right?\n\n472\n00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:54.152\nSo D- 2 is going to wind up being what?\n\n473\n00:23:54.152 --> 00:23:55.308\n&gt;&gt; The B.\n&gt;&gt; The B, right.\n\n474\n00:23:55.308 --> 00:23:58.680\nAnd then for the O, right,\nwe were saying we would do +1 So\n\n475\n00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:02.266\nwe would do, I keep hitting\nthe down arrow instead of the over.\n\n476\n00:24:02.266 --> 00:24:05.678\n&gt;&gt; That's okay,\nI just had to say L-M-N-O in my head.\n\n477\n00:24:05.678 --> 00:24:07.250\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're a minnow?\n\n478\n00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:08.025\nWhat was that?\n\n479\n00:24:08.025 --> 00:24:10.300\n&gt;&gt; L-M-N-O you know how little kids,\nthey're, no.\n\n480\n00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.024\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we have +1, and for O+1,\n\n481\n00:24:13.024 --> 00:24:17.782\nwe would get L-M-N-O or\nhow most people pronounce it,\n\n482\n00:24:17.782 --> 00:24:20.895\nL-M-N-O, cuz they talk slowly.\n\n483\n00:24:20.895 --> 00:24:22.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then you would get what comes after\n\n484\n00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.410\nO, you would get P, right?\n\n485\n00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:24.320\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; So you would have\n\n486\n00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:24.980\n&gt;&gt; We have b.\n\n487\n00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:26.580\nSo we've done those three, but\n\n488\n00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:30.290\nnow the challenge is we're out\nof essentially alphabets, right?\n\n489\n00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:32.010\nSo we round robin start again.\n\n490\n00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:35.640\nInstead of having more shifts\nwe go back to plus one.\n\n491\n00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:38.750\nSo for g we would do plus one and\nthat leads to h.\n\n492\n00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:42.860\nSo if we had not just a dog, but\nif we had a sentence the dog is blue.\n\n493\n00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:47.230\nWe would do every block of three and\nthen a round robin back to the beginning.\n\n494\n00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:52.070\nWe would chunk the message, in other\nwords, into sets of three letters and\n\n495\n00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:56.280\nbe centrally substituting them and\nshifting them.\n\n496\n00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:56.910\n&gt;&gt; It's further.\n\n497\n00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:57.990\n&gt;&gt; And further obfuscate as we go.\n\n498\n00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:01.090\nSo the trick with\nthe multi-alphabet cyphers\n\n499\n00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:04.420\nis to understand the number of alphabets,\nwhich gives you the number\n\n500\n00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:07.390\nof the shifts you do before you\nstart repeating and round robining.\n\n501\n00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:10.050\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So, depending on how we set this up, if\n\n502\n00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:14.980\nit is a four alphabet, or a two alphabet,\nor a six alphabet, or whatever it is,\n\n503\n00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:19.300\nyou'd have that number of shifts, and then\nyou would start round robining as a result\n\n504\n00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:23.100\nof that as you walk through\n&gt;&gt; Which is, again, by today's standards\n\n505\n00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:28.590\nvery rudimentary but back then,\nagain, people didn't read and write.\n\n506\n00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:30.340\nThey didn't know this stuff.\n\n507\n00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:33.667\nThey went and the only thing\nthey probably knew how to do and\n\n508\n00:25:33.667 --> 00:25:37.325\nthey didn't learn how\nto read to do this was.\n\n509\n00:25:37.325 --> 00:25:41.775\nIf they went to pray whatever that meant\nfor them Jewish, Catholic, Buddhist,\n\n510\n00:25:41.775 --> 00:25:42.995\nwhoever whatever it was.\n\n511\n00:25:42.995 --> 00:25:45.095\nThey probably memorized the prayers.\n\n512\n00:25:45.095 --> 00:25:48.335\nThey didn't read them, because the average\nperson didn't know how to read.\n\n513\n00:25:48.335 --> 00:25:52.655\nBut from the time they were little,\ngoing to whatever that service was or\n\n514\n00:25:52.655 --> 00:25:55.485\nobserving their religion, they were\ntaught by rote essentially they would\n\n515\n00:25:55.485 --> 00:25:57.490\nmemorize the\n&gt;&gt; Religious prayers and\n\n516\n00:25:57.490 --> 00:25:59.450\nservices they needed to observe.\n\n517\n00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:01.920\nAnd so, they didn't know how to read.\n\n518\n00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:05.050\nThey just understood that they\ncould say whatever the prayer was.\n\n519\n00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:08.150\nSo this kind of stuff worked incredibly\nwell for a long time because,\n\n520\n00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:11.340\nagain, language, alphabet,\nshifting multiple alphabets.\n\n521\n00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:12.480\nI don't even know one.\n\n522\n00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.242\nNow you want me to learn three.\n\n523\n00:26:14.242 --> 00:26:15.654\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There was no way that the average\n\n524\n00:26:15.654 --> 00:26:17.200\nperson understood this stuff.\n\n525\n00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:21.630\nThat's why the aristocracy and\nthe people that were doing this and\n\n526\n00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:26.470\nthe spies, as we learn about in the more\nmodern history and the 15, 16, 17,\n\n527\n00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:29.870\n1800's and more modern recorded history.\n\n528\n00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:32.720\nAll those spies for\nthe most part are people that come from\n\n529\n00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.340\nthe educated classes, because they had\nto read and write in order to do this.\n\n530\n00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:36.430\n&gt;&gt; Still kind of like that today, Adam.\n\n531\n00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:40.030\n&gt;&gt; For the most part, but not necessarily.\n\n532\n00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:44.080\nI mean, when you think about, and you\nhear about some of these modern examples\n\n533\n00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.230\nof people doing these kinda things.\n\n534\n00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:49.000\nThey're certainly educated people,\nI'm not suggesting they're not.\n\n535\n00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.215\nBut today,\n\n536\n00:26:50.215 --> 00:26:54.605\npeople don't have to know how to do\nthis kind of stuff to use cryptography.\n\n537\n00:26:54.605 --> 00:26:58.458\nRemember, we have, as I hate to say,\nwe have an app for that, right?\n\n538\n00:26:58.458 --> 00:26:59.855\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So as you've said,\n\n539\n00:26:59.855 --> 00:27:01.255\nyou download the NSA challenge.\n\n540\n00:27:01.255 --> 00:27:02.015\nYou do it on your.\n\n541\n00:27:02.015 --> 00:27:04.665\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; There are so many things that make this\n\n542\n00:27:04.665 --> 00:27:08.665\npossible for us today that are helping\nus with computers and automation.\n\n543\n00:27:08.665 --> 00:27:09.895\n&gt;&gt; Not just reserved for the elite?\n\n544\n00:27:09.895 --> 00:27:11.295\n&gt;&gt; Not just reserved for the elite.\n\n545\n00:27:11.295 --> 00:27:13.580\nIt's very approachable for\nthe average individual.\n\n546\n00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:17.430\nBecause they can use computers and\ncomputers can, with software and\n\n547\n00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:19.930\nthings like that, help us to do this.\n\n548\n00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:23.510\nBut you don't sit down at a drawing\nboard any more with a piece of paper and\n\n549\n00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:25.280\nwork this stuff out by hand.\n\n550\n00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.110\nUnless you're doing something just for\nfun,\n\n551\n00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:29.430\nor you're doing it just to prove a point.\n\n552\n00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:32.380\nThis is the kind of\nstuff you do when you're\n\n553\n00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:35.740\nessentially just teaching students how\nto do it we do this kind of stuff but.\n\n554\n00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:39.760\nThis is all automated today, I open up\na program, I feed in the cipher text\n\n555\n00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:42.770\nthere's 20 different algorithms and\nit walks through all of them,\n\n556\n00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:46.410\nfigures it out and if it's in\nthere it'll find it very quickly.\n\n557\n00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:50.450\nSo it's much more technologically\ndriven today if you will.\n\n558\n00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:53.080\nWe also talk about something\nknown as a cipher disk,\n\n559\n00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.950\nthis is kind of a cool\nrelic of technology.\n\n560\n00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:57.940\nIt is literally a disk.\n\n561\n00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:00.980\nIt would have been a mechanical device,\na metal disk of some kind\n\n562\n00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:04.770\nthat you would have spun or somehow\nrotated and depending on how you set it,\n\n563\n00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:08.470\nit would then be able to drive\nthe encryption-decryption as a result.\n\n564\n00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:12.330\nSo we use it to encrypt,\nit was created back in the late 1400s.\n\n565\n00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:18.150\nSo this device is close to\n550 years old or so now.\n\n566\n00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:21.330\nInvented by a guy named Leon Alberti, so\n\n567\n00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:27.140\nhe comes up with this idea, and\nit was a poly alphabetic cypher.\n\n568\n00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:30.030\nEach time you turned the disk you\nessentially created a new cypher.\n\n569\n00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:32.500\nSo imagine again not using English\n\n570\n00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:35.500\nper se at the time the way we would\nthink of the English language today.\n\n571\n00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:40.670\nPerhaps Italian at the time, right,\nAlberti was Italian perhaps Portuguese,\n\n572\n00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:42.990\nperhaps Spanish, perhaps French.\n\n573\n00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:46.230\nI mean, these all would have\nbeen languages that major\n\n574\n00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:48.760\npowers of the day would\nhave had access to.\n\n575\n00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:53.050\nRoman, so you would have used probably,\nnot Roman, rather but\n\n576\n00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:55.650\nItalian, the language of the church,\nright.\n\n577\n00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:56.800\nSo you would have had that or\n\n578\n00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:01.640\nclassical Latin, you would have used\nthat probably, right, in that time?\n\n579\n00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.830\nAnd this could have been used and\nprobably was used by the church.\n\n580\n00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:08.100\nTo send and receive secure\ncommunications by the Vatican, or\n\n581\n00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:11.150\nwhat we would think of today as\nthe Vatican and the Catholic Church.\n\n582\n00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:12.400\nAt that time, and still for\n\n583\n00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:17.190\nmany hundreds of years after that, one of\nthe preeminent powers in the world, right?\n\n584\n00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:21.730\nIn terms of the fact that they controlled\nhuge amounts of money, land, armies.\n\n585\n00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:25.100\nThey were secretly communicating\nwith all the Heads of States and\n\n586\n00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:26.140\nall sorts of stuff.\n\n587\n00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:29.450\nI mean, this would have been a big deal\nback in the time when this was invented.\n\n588\n00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:34.490\nSo you can imagine somebody having\nliterally a small dial-like device,\n\n589\n00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:37.250\nprobably mounted on a piece of wood or\nsomething like that.\n\n590\n00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:40.210\nAnd you would have then seen\nthe ability for a scribe or\n\n591\n00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:43.590\nsomebody who was doing this encryption,\ndecryption to be able to set it.\n\n592\n00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:49.580\nThis can trace directly forward\n500 years to World War II and\n\n593\n00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:50.800\nthe periods between the first and\n\n594\n00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:56.930\nsecond world war coming out of the late\n1800s into the first half of the 1900s.\n\n595\n00:29:56.930 --> 00:30:00.120\nAnd we see the use of things\nlike the Enigma machine\n\n596\n00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.600\nby the Germans in World War II that\n\n597\n00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:07.290\nused a roto mechanical roto cipher system\nbuilt on the idea of cipher discs.\n\n598\n00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:12.244\nBut multiple cipher discs Control inside\nof a machine automated instead of a human\n\n599\n00:30:12.244 --> 00:30:17.069\nturning one dial you had multiple dials\nthat essentially would then be preset.\n\n600\n00:30:17.069 --> 00:30:21.298\nBut you could see a 500 year history\ndirectly from Alberti's invention to\n\n601\n00:30:21.298 --> 00:30:25.830\nthe enigma machine and what we would\nthink of is more or less the modern day.\n\n602\n00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:30.480\nThis is really what we point to as\nthe beginning of modern cryptography and\n\n603\n00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.820\nmodern cryptosystems.\n\n604\n00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:35.470\nThings like the enigma machine because\nthere are examples of early computers,\n\n605\n00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:40.130\nessentially early electro mechanical\nsystems that are to this day still use but\n\n606\n00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:41.320\nderivatives of them.\n\n607\n00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:44.310\nSo it's very fascinating to go back and\nlook at that history and\n\n608\n00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:46.430\nsee how that kind of comes together.\n\n609\n00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:48.230\nAnd we see the tracking of that.\n\n610\n00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:49.040\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool.\n\n611\n00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:52.790\n&gt;&gt; All right Adam, I think we are about\nout of time for this episode.\n\n612\n00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:55.250\nBut we do have a lot of other\ntechniques that we need to cover.\n\n613\n00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:58.035\nSo we’re gonna go ahead and\ncreate a part three, if you’re up for it.\n\n614\n00:30:58.035 --> 00:30:59.375\n&gt;&gt; Oh-uh, part three, yay.\n\n615\n00:30:59.375 --> 00:31:00.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We made it.\n\n616\n00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.658\n&gt;&gt; Wait, wait, let me do, part three.\n\n617\n00:31:01.658 --> 00:31:04.028\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Three.\n\n618\n00:31:04.028 --> 00:31:07.376\nAll right, so ladies and gentlemen stay\ntuned because like I just said we will\n\n619\n00:31:07.376 --> 00:31:09.260\nhave more information to cover for that.\n\n620\n00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:13.020\nI'm gonna go ahead and sign off for\nshow as your host Cherokee.\n\n621\n00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:13.990\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n622\n00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:15.980\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at IT PRO TV.\n\n623\n00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:16.932\n&gt;&gt; For part three.\n\n624\n00:31:16.932 --> 00:31:21.035\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n625\n00:31:21.035 --> 00:31:24.491\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n626\n00:31:24.491

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:11.328 --> 00:00:16.990\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your E/CES series,\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n4\n00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.640\nIn this episode, we will continue to\nlearn the history of cryptography.\n\n5\n00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.900\nAnd with us today we have Mr.\n\n6\n00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.860\nAdam Gordon in studios, thank you for\njoining us today, Adam.\n\n7\n00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.040\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome, welcome,\n\n8\n00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.530\nalways a pleasure to be here talking\nabout cryptography with you fine folks.\n\n9\n00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.830\nSo let's continue our conversation.\n\n10\n00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.360\nWe in the last episode had\nstarted to delve into some of\n\n11\n00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.740\nthe historical background.\n\n12\n00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.280\nWe talked about monoalphabetic\nsubstitutions, talked about multiple\n\n13\n00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.340\nalphabetic substitutions ciphers versus\npolyalphabetic multialphabetic ciphers.\n\n14\n00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.700\nWe went through and took a lot at\nsome of the ways and techniques and\n\n15\n00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.150\nthought processes around them.\n\n16\n00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.680\nTalked about sky tail cypher, talked about\nthe Caesar cipher, raw thirteen, ad bash.\n\n17\n00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.345\nJust went through and\ntalked about some of those.\n\n18\n00:00:58.345 --> 00:01:03.035\nAnd we also demoed and showed you\na little bit about how the shift, right,\n\n19\n00:01:03.035 --> 00:01:06.035\nforward or backwards with the plus or\nminus notation.\n\n20\n00:01:06.035 --> 00:01:10.212\nWould work for a Caesar cipher and\nhow we would then be able to read that and\n\n21\n00:01:10.212 --> 00:01:10.841\nsee that.\n\n22\n00:01:10.841 --> 00:01:13.975\nIf you haven't taken a look at that\nepisode, always encourage you to go back.\n\n23\n00:01:13.975 --> 00:01:17.575\nJust make sure chronologically,\nyou're kind of keeping up with us so\n\n24\n00:01:17.575 --> 00:01:21.355\nas we jump in and start talking about some\nof the additional historical background.\n\n25\n00:01:21.355 --> 00:01:24.580\nThe play fair cipher and\nsome of the things we'll talk about now,\n\n26\n00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.800\nthat it just contextually makes sense for\nyou.\n\n27\n00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.400\nSo that you have that background and\nyou have a sense of that.\n\n28\n00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.000\nBut if you have already, great.\n\n29\n00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.110\nIf not, no big deal, watch this and\nthen go back and watch us there.\n\n30\n00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.270\nAnd you'll have it all fall into place.\n\n31\n00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.920\nSo, let's start by talking\nabout an interesting cipher,\n\n32\n00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.210\none that's a personal favorite of mine\nbecause of the history associated with it.\n\n33\n00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.070\nBecause it's often attributed\nto the wrong individual,\n\n34\n00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.440\nwhich is kind of interesting just\nas this historical footnote.\n\n35\n00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.465\nThe Vigenère or Vigenere essentially,\nor sometimes referred to as\n\n36\n00:01:53.465 --> 00:01:56.800\nthe Vigenere cipher,\nit depends on how you pronounce it.\n\n37\n00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.031\nVigenere is often sometimes\ndiscussed as well, but\n\n38\n00:01:59.031 --> 00:02:00.913\nthat's a whole different pastry concept.\n\n39\n00:02:00.913 --> 00:02:02.945\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not a name of a gentleman who is named\n\n40\n00:02:02.945 --> 00:02:06.335\nfor or was the quote,\nunquote person behind the cipher.\n\n41\n00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:09.605\nBut actually the Vigenere\ncipher was invented by somebody\n\n42\n00:02:09.605 --> 00:02:12.515\ntotally different than who\nit's normally attributed to.\n\n43\n00:02:12.515 --> 00:02:18.520\nIt was invented by Giovan Battista Bellaso\nin the early, middle 1500s.\n\n44\n00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.780\nBut he doesn't normally get credit for\nthis, believe it or not.\n\n45\n00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.080\nNormally you hear about\nBlaze the Vigenère,\n\n46\n00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.550\nwho is the namesake of the cipher.\n\n47\n00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.160\nBut didn't have anything to do with\nit initially and developed and\n\n48\n00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.160\nworked on it after it was invented and\ncreated a stronger version of it.\n\n49\n00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.650\nBut it is often misattributed to him\n\n50\n00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.100\neven though he didn't really have\nanything to do with it initially.\n\n51\n00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.900\nSo poor Battista Bellaso, gets no credit\nand Vigenere gets all the credit.\n\n52\n00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.230\nSo go figure that out.\n\n53\n00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.970\nBut anyway, so\njust want to make you're aware of that.\n\n54\n00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.010\nBut ultimately,\n\n55\n00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.930\nwe encrypt using a series of [INAUDIBLE]\nciphers interwoven together.\n\n56\n00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.030\nWhich is taking the Caesar\nciphers from back in the day and\n\n57\n00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.250\nusing them, bringing them forward,\nbut combining them together.\n\n58\n00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.460\nAnd as a result of combining them or\n\n59\n00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.030\ninterweaving them,\ncoming up with a stronger solution.\n\n60\n00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.680\nWhich is obviously gonna be a little\ninteresting, a little bit of a derivative,\n\n61\n00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.190\nbut brings it forward a little bit.\n\n62\n00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.380\nWe based that and do the Caesar\nciphers around the keyword and\n\n63\n00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.500\nthen we use the polyalphabetic\ncipher system to be able to do this.\n\n64\n00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.940\nSo I'm gonna show you a picture of\nwhat this looks like in a minute.\n\n65\n00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:29.830\nSuccessfully used into what we would\nthink of as the somewhat modern day.\n\n66\n00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.820\nIt was not initially cracked\nuntil the late 1800s and\n\n67\n00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.280\n1863 is the first time successfully\nthat somebody published a paper\n\n68\n00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.640\nthat explained how to\nbreak the Vigenere cipher.\n\n69\n00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.440\nSo it was in play for probably 300\nyears being used successfully to\n\n70\n00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.540\nsecurely communicate before somebody\nfigured out, worked out the mathematics.\n\n71\n00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.034\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty impressive.\n\n72\n00:03:52.034 --> 00:03:53.010\n&gt;&gt; To actually be able to do that.\n\n73\n00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.780\nFrederick Casisky is the gentleman\nwho actually publishes the paper\n\n74\n00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:57.430\nin the late 1800s.\n\n75\n00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.200\nThat explains the mathematics and\nthe logic of how to break it and\n\n76\n00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.640\nas a result, it was used as I said for\nover 300 years.\n\n77\n00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.920\nLet's do the following,\njust give me one second here.\n\n78\n00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.860\nBut let's go to my machine\nreal quick if we could.\n\n79\n00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.150\nLet me just show you what a Vigenere\ncipher square actually looks like,\n\n80\n00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.860\nany one of these will work.\n\n81\n00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.760\nBut what you essentially get, so\n\n82\n00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.700\nzero in on one of these is you\nget a grid that looks like this.\n\n83\n00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.680\nAnd so you have again,\nusing English obviously as our language.\n\n84\n00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.230\nWe would change this if it was another\nlanguage with different characters, but\n\n85\n00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.560\nthe idea would be the same.\n\n86\n00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.490\nYou lay it out across the top here,\n\n87\n00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.110\nA through Z, going down the side\nhere A through Z this way.\n\n88\n00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.760\nAnd then I know it's kind of hard to see,\nyou have to zoom in.\n\n89\n00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.120\nSo let's just go ahead and\nlet's zoom in real quick,\n\n90\n00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.310\nsee if we could get that to be any bigger.\n\n91\n00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.650\nNot really much, but there we go,\nthat's a little bit better.\n\n92\n00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.880\nAnd then so what you could\nsee is that we lay out rows.\n\n93\n00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.700\nAnd so we're going across\nA through Z in the first one.\n\n94\n00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:59.790\nAnd notice we shift.\n\n95\n00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.610\nB starts the second one.\n\n96\n00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.802\nThen C, D, E, F, all the way down.\n\n97\n00:05:04.802 --> 00:05:08.550\nAnd by the time we get down,\nwe're starting with Z and then going to A.\n\n98\n00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.010\nAnd so as we shift all the way across and\n\n99\n00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.860\nthen we start to lay out the grid for\nhow we're gonna actually encrypt or\n\n100\n00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.910\ndecrypt the message, we've got a much\nmore complex system to work with.\n\n101\n00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.794\nBecause you're not just using\nA through Z in one way.\n\n102\n00:05:23.794 --> 00:05:28.860\nYou're using 26 lines, right,\nas you go through and looking at this.\n\n103\n00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.300\nAnd so\nit's actually a very complicated setup and\n\n104\n00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.720\nas a result, was highly successful.\n\n105\n00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.630\nBecause unless you knew the pattern\nto set up the square and\n\n106\n00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.060\nunless you knew the starting point and\n\n107\n00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.650\nunderstood how to lay out the grid,\nyou had no way of deciphering the message.\n\n108\n00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:44.200\nI mean you could but\n\n109\n00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.130\nit would just would take you forever\nbecause you had no way to figure it out.\n\n110\n00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.640\nSo it's kind of interesting when you\ntake a look at what this looks like.\n\n111\n00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.280\nAnd as a result of that, just get a sense\nof just how revolutionary this approach\n\n112\n00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.640\nwas back in the mid 1500s when\nBattista figures this out.\n\n113\n00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.280\nAt the time if you think about this,\nsomebody's sitting around.\n\n114\n00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.740\nNot a lot on TV back then,\nso not much to do.\n\n115\n00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.220\n&gt;&gt; I can't think of any modern encryption\nalgorithm that's lasted that long.\n\n116\n00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.810\n&gt;&gt; Well, no not modern ones,\n\n117\n00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.390\ncertainly because they just haven't\nbeen around that long to begin with.\n\n118\n00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:14.998\nSo that would certainly be-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, yeah.\n\n119\n00:06:14.998 --> 00:06:19.430\n&gt;&gt; Be accurate and true and I can't argue\nwith that logic because that is the case.\n\n120\n00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.380\nDepending on how you define modern, right?\n\n121\n00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.650\nHow long, how far back that timeline goes,\nso you're right.\n\n122\n00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.820\nBut I know what you're saying, it's not so\nmuch the time length, it is, but\n\n123\n00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.940\nnot really in the sense\nyou're talking about it.\n\n124\n00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.900\nIt's really more being able to stand\nup to the amount of time it would take\n\n125\n00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.230\nto go through that over time for\nthe attacks.\n\n126\n00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:39.270\nAnd you're right, modern crypto\nsystems Have not been time tested for\n\n127\n00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.500\nthis amount of time, for 300 years\n&gt;&gt; Sure\n\n128\n00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.610\n&gt;&gt; Compared to what this was.\n\n129\n00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.900\nAnd the fact that this stood up to\nthat amount of time, given the window,\n\n130\n00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.920\njust the technological window\nof how this all played out.\n\n131\n00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.750\nThis was before the advent\nof modern computers.\n\n132\n00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Modern computers are not developed\n\n133\n00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:59.230\nuntil the early to mid 1900s, the theories\nbehind them in the early 1900s\n\n134\n00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:00.820\n&gt;&gt; Practical application of it we don't\n\n135\n00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:05.450\nsee until the 1940s and we start to see\nmodern, what we would think of as modern\n\n136\n00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:09.540\ncomputers being built and prototyped and\nbeing used into the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n137\n00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.170\nAnd then obviously out beyond\nthat into the modern day.\n\n138\n00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:17.690\nSo I mean, that history goes back 70,\n80 years at this point from what we\n\n139\n00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:22.210\nwould think of as Modern prototypical\ncomputers nowhere near as long as this.\n\n140\n00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:23.290\nBut still impressive.\n\n141\n00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:24.350\n&gt;&gt; What are we looking at?\n\n142\n00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.640\nDes is our first solidified algorithm.\n\n143\n00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.550\nAnd that was what, 70s?\n\n144\n00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:29.690\nEarly 60s?\n\n145\n00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.150\n&gt;&gt; The math behind it would have\nbeen in the 60s into the 70s DES,\n\n146\n00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.080\nthe Data Encryption Standard.\n\n147\n00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:41.200\ndouble desk, triple desk, so 3-2 desk\nas a modern cryptographic algorithm.\n\n148\n00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.010\nWe moved past that in the last\nseveral years into AES,\n\n149\n00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:46.770\nthe Advanced Encryption Standard.\n\n150\n00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:48.686\nAnd RC4, RC5, and\n\n151\n00:07:48.686 --> 00:07:54.758\nthe 5 shy one hashing algorithms\nYou have RSA, the RSA algorithm.\n\n152\n00:07:54.758 --> 00:07:58.504\nThere's a host of modern algorithms, but\nnone of them have been around anywhere\n\n153\n00:07:58.504 --> 00:08:00.777\nnear as long as this system,\nas you were saying.\n\n154\n00:08:00.777 --> 00:08:02.512\nAnd you're absolutely\nright to point that out.\n\n155\n00:08:02.512 --> 00:08:04.665\nIt's a good observation.\n\n156\n00:08:04.665 --> 00:08:07.963\nOn your part, kudos, take a gold star\nout of petty cash when we're done.\n\n157\n00:08:07.963 --> 00:08:11.532\n&gt;&gt; How about I just take one\nof those Bigenere's instead?\n\n158\n00:08:11.532 --> 00:08:13.450\n&gt;&gt; Take one of those Bigenere's,\nthat would work also.\n\n159\n00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:14.780\nI prefer Bigenere's to Vigenere's,\n\n160\n00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.250\nmuch more enjoyable when you're\nsitting down to have a cup of coffee.\n\n161\n00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:21.080\nSo the play fair cipher is the other\none we want to talk about here as well.\n\n162\n00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.150\nAgain, little bit of\ninteresting history here.\n\n163\n00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:28.590\nInvented by somebody named Charles\nWheatstone in the mid to late 1800s,\n\n164\n00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:29.290\nabout 1854.\n\n165\n00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:33.360\nNamed for the benefactor, Lord Playfair,\nwho gets behind this thing,\n\n166\n00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.460\nis really pushing the use of it.\n\n167\n00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:38.200\nSo back then you said, yeah,\nI'll put my name on it.\n\n168\n00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.270\nAnd literally,\nthey put your name on it, right?\n\n169\n00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.720\nThey named it after you.\n\n170\n00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:45.920\nSo the Playfair cipher gets named for\nthis aristocrat who really gets behind and\n\n171\n00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.490\nstarts pushing him and using it.\n\n172\n00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.230\nBut Wheatstone is the guy who invented it.\n\n173\n00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:51.850\nWe never hear about him, we hear\nabout Lord Playfair all the time and\n\n174\n00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:52.970\nthe Playfair cipher.\n\n175\n00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:54.420\nBut the Playfair cipher's\nkinda interesting.\n\n176\n00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:55.800\nIt uses a five by five table.\n\n177\n00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:00.640\nSo it looks suspiciously like\nthe Vigenere Cipher table but\n\n178\n00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.900\nit's not set up the same way.\n\n179\n00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:05.200\nIf you saw a full one built out,\nAnd it was built at.\n\n180\n00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.840\nI'm gonna show you what it\nlooks like in a minute.\n\n181\n00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.530\nIt's a very small subset of that.\n\n182\n00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:11.230\nBut we take the keyword,\nwhatever that keyword will be.\n\n183\n00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:15.800\nWe lay it out, and then after that,\nwe insert the rest of the letters of\n\n184\n00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:19.220\nthe alphabet in order, skipping\nthe ones that have all ready been used.\n\n185\n00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:23.370\nIf you use a keyword like I'm about\nto show you the word keyword,\n\n186\n00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:25.120\nwe lay that out,\nthis is what it will look like.\n\n187\n00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.340\nSo we go to my machine here for\na minute, we'll take a look.\n\n188\n00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.060\nAnd can we go full screen just so\nwe can see that a little bit easier?\n\n189\n00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.950\nYou'll see here, and\nI describe it up above,\n\n190\n00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:35.200\nyou can certainly read\nthrough it while I'm talking.\n\n191\n00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.110\nBut I used the keyword, keyword.\n\n192\n00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:39.570\nAnd if you look,\nyou'll see it right there.\n\n193\n00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:43.050\nLet me just try to highlight that\nagain without letting go this time.\n\n194\n00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:44.850\nSo you'll see that's the keyword.\n\n195\n00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:46.590\nSo I laid out keyword.\n\n196\n00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:50.440\nAnd then after that to round\nout the five by five square.\n\n197\n00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:54.500\nYou'll see that I lay in the rest of the\nletters of the alphabet starting with A so\n\n198\n00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:58.080\nA, B, C but\nI skip D because D is part of keyword.\n\n199\n00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.010\nAnd then I went to F right,\nI skipped D and I skipped E because D and\n\n200\n00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:03.330\nE are there right?\n\n201\n00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:04.210\n&gt;&gt; L, M, N, O, P\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS]\n\n202\n00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:07.040\n&gt;&gt; And so I did that and then the G, H, I.\n\n203\n00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.470\nSkip J because J is combined\nwith I in that cipher, so\n\n204\n00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:15.610\nyou don't put a J in so\nI then L M N O, we skip O.\n\n205\n00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:18.010\nP Q skip R right?\n\n206\n00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:22.060\nS T U V W X I'm out of character\nI don't put the Y in right?\n\n207\n00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:25.640\nW X Y and\nZ I leave those out cause the length or\n\n208\n00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.440\nthe size of my keyword was big\nenough that it bumped them out.\n\n209\n00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.400\nSo you'd have to know that,\nknow the keyword, know the layout.\n\n210\n00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.980\nKnow I skipped J in order to\nfigure out the actually grid here\n\n211\n00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.750\nto then use this to drive\nthe encryption and decryption.\n\n212\n00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:44.590\nAnd the Playfair Cipher is interesting\nas I put in here in the notes,\n\n213\n00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:49.610\nalso because it's the first time that\nwe start to actually use, not only this\n\n214\n00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:53.870\nkind of a table, but we generate the key\ntable, we fill it in as I told you.\n\n215\n00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:57.590\nAnd then we fill in the remaining\nspaces when through all that, but\n\n216\n00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:00.150\nwe encrypt pairs of letters\nthat are called digraphs.\n\n217\n00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:05.290\nSo we chunk the letters of the message\ntogether into groups of two,\n\n218\n00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:07.900\ninstead of doing a single\none we do two letters.\n\n219\n00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:15.900\nSo if the message was the dog is blue,\nwe would chunk this.\n\n220\n00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.500\nAnd do this.\n\n221\n00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:19.930\nIf you think about it.\n\n222\n00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:22.160\n&gt;&gt; Excluding spaces here?\n\n223\n00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.960\n&gt;&gt; Well yeah, excluding spaces.\n\n224\n00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:24.590\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n225\n00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:26.420\n&gt;&gt; And we would do that.\n\n226\n00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:29.230\nIgnore the spaces between them.\n\n227\n00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:29.980\nI'm just putting spaces\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n228\n00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:30.880\nYep.\n&gt;&gt; in obviously just to\n\n229\n00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.400\nshow us how to chunk it.\n\n230\n00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:37.390\nBut we would take each two of these and\nwe would encrypt a block of\n\n231\n00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:42.590\ntwo letters into a single\nencrypted cipher text element.\n\n232\n00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:47.010\nGetting rid of and overcoming the concerns\nwith single alphabet ciphers,\n\n233\n00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:50.130\nwhich was frequencies we\ntalked about in prior episode.\n\n234\n00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.550\nBy encrypting two letters together and\n\n235\n00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:56.370\nrepresenting them with a single value,\nyou can't do frequency analysis because we\n\n236\n00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:58.790\nhide the frequency inside the encryption-\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n237\n00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:00.440\nwe're kind of moving down\nthis evolution chain.\n\n238\n00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.040\nWe're moving into block cyphers.\n\n239\n00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.580\n&gt;&gt; They're getting smarter, right?\n\n240\n00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:07.530\nBecause it's much harder to break because\nyou can't do the frequency analysis.\n\n241\n00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:12.100\nBecause you don't know, right, how often\nE appears, because E is being paired with\n\n242\n00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:16.210\nsomething else or A or whatever\nwould be much harder to do, right.\n\n243\n00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:19.920\nAnd so as a result becomes\nmuch much more difficult for\n\n244\n00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:23.570\nus to be able to break things that\nwere done with the Playfair Cipher.\n\n245\n00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:29.370\nPlayfair Cipher was used up into\nthe modern era, and was used into well,\n\n246\n00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:34.370\ninto the early 1900s by the British and\nby other European powers.\n\n247\n00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:38.120\nIt was considered unbreakable for\nat least that period of time anyway.\n\n248\n00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.760\nSo it's kinda interesting\nwhen you see this, right?\n\n249\n00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:45.848\nThen we talk about something\nknown as the ADFGVX cipher.\n\n250\n00:12:45.848 --> 00:12:46.663\n&gt;&gt; What?\n&gt;&gt; ADFGVX,\n\n251\n00:12:46.663 --> 00:12:51.923\nthere was a derivative of ADFGVV\nthe early version of the cipher,\n\n252\n00:12:51.923 --> 00:12:56.950\nand then ADV-ADFGVX becomes\nthe more recent version.\n\n253\n00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:00.410\nThis was actually used by\nthe Germany army in World War I,\n\n254\n00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:03.630\nit was considered a secure cipher and\nwas used by them.\n\n255\n00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:07.710\nInvented by somebody called\nColonel Fritz Nobel, or Nebel,\n\n256\n00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:12.390\nexcuse me, in 1918, right around\nthe end of the first world war, or\n\n257\n00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:14.460\nvery close to the end\nof the first world war.\n\n258\n00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:19.230\nSo it was used during the end of that\nperiod of time, to transposition Cipher.\n\n259\n00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:22.650\nUses what's called a Polybius square,\nwhich is another interesting approach.\n\n260\n00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:25.100\nWe'll show you an example\nof this in just a minute.\n\n261\n00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.480\nAnd it goes ahead and\n\n262\n00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:32.130\nuses a 36 letter alphabet to be able\nto do the in code and or the decode.\n\n263\n00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.680\nAnd so what we ultimately end\nup doing is the following.\n\n264\n00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.680\nLet me just scroll down here so\nwe can kinda see this.\n\n265\n00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.500\nIf we could go back to my machine\njust to show you what we have set up.\n\n266\n00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:41.320\nYou get a little history.\n\n267\n00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.720\nYou read through some of\nthe stuff I was just explaining.\n\n268\n00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:49.780\nBut what you'll see is we create a grid so\nyou have A D F G V X on the upper right.\n\n269\n00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.360\nAnd A D F G V X running\ndown the side here.\n\n270\n00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.310\nSo again, we lay it out so\nwe have, you know, kind of the L.\n\n271\n00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:56.520\nThe inverted L.\n\n272\n00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:59.330\nAnd then what we do is we insert.\n\n273\n00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:03.630\nAnd when I say 36 letter alphabet what\nI mean is the 26 letter English or\n\n274\n00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:05.140\nwhatever version of the alphabet.\n\n275\n00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:07.320\nPlus the number zero through nine.\n\n276\n00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:11.300\nSo when you add zero through nine,\ntotal of ten numbers,\n\n277\n00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:16.800\nplus the 26 letters of the alphabet in\nEnglish, you get a 36 letter number\n\n278\n00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:21.400\nhybrid combination that becomes a six\nby six square, instead of five by five.\n\n279\n00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.230\nAnd that.\n&gt;&gt; So the randomize is put in.\n\n280\n00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:27.760\nSo you could see, and I just zipped\nthis up quickly before we came on.\n\n281\n00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.540\nSo I went out had a couple of\nmy famous double espressos.\n\n282\n00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:31.060\n&gt;&gt; Woo hoo.\n\n283\n00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:32.520\n&gt;&gt; And sat down,\nwhipped this out right away.\n\n284\n00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.360\nAll right.\n\n285\n00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.450\nSo you see we have the A D F,\nG B X, A D F, G B X.\n\n286\n00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:37.878\nAnd I laid in numbers and letters.\n\n287\n00:14:37.878 --> 00:14:42.620\n1 Q 2 E T P W R U I 9.\n\n288\n00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:43.760\nThat is a.\n\n289\n00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:45.950\nO, right?\n\n290\n00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:48.590\nDown here is a zero,\nyou could see the difference.\n\n291\n00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:52.970\nAnd so we lay all this in, and\nthen what we do is we go and\n\n292\n00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:57.570\nfind the grid, the intersection,\nthe x y axis coordinates of the letter.\n\n293\n00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:01.360\nSo if the plain text is dog, D-O-G.\n\n294\n00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.810\nWe look for D in the grid here, right?\n\n295\n00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:08.850\nAnd so we go look for D and\nwe see that D is right down here.\n\n296\n00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:09.950\nLet's highlight it.\n\n297\n00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:14.750\nAnd so to represent D,\nwe take the column and row designation.\n\n298\n00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:18.650\nWe take D at the top and\nV as the intersection point.\n\n299\n00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:20.720\nThink of it as an Excel spreadsheet right?\n\n300\n00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.530\nThis is like cell F2 or whatever.\n\n301\n00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:27.910\nAnd so you look at that and\nsay okay, D would equal DV and so\n\n302\n00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:31.930\ncipher text for\nD becomes DV right down here.\n\n303\n00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:38.080\nAnd if we chunk these just to show you how\neach one represents one of the letters.\n\n304\n00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.980\nTo just move them out O.\n\n305\n00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:44.790\nRight O is right here so\nO is X and O is D and\n\n306\n00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:47.975\nyou could see down Down here XD and\nthen we have G, right?\n\n307\n00:15:47.975 --> 00:15:51.965\nSo you find G, and\nG is going to be right here.\n\n308\n00:15:51.965 --> 00:15:54.834\nAnd we have A and we have V.\n\n309\n00:15:54.834 --> 00:15:59.656\nAnd so, the cipher text for\ndog, right, would actually be\n\n310\n00:15:59.656 --> 00:16:04.391\nD-V-X-D-A-V using this\nparticular ADFGVX cipher.\n\n311\n00:16:04.391 --> 00:16:07.551\nA, B, C, 1, 2, 3, do, re, me,\nyou and me, see you later,\n\n312\n00:16:07.551 --> 00:16:10.570\nred fish, blue fish,\none fish, two fish, right?\n\n313\n00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:14.790\nSo all of that is going to then\nrepresent the cipher text.\n\n314\n00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:18.700\nAnd so when we send the cipher text\nmessage, the person that receives it\n\n315\n00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:22.480\nhas to have this exact grid laid out\nthis way to do the cross walk and\n\n316\n00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:26.110\nwalk it backwards in order to figure\nout how to decipher the message.\n\n317\n00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:28.140\n&gt;&gt; Otherwise it's just useless stuff,\nright?\n\n318\n00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:31.250\n&gt;&gt; Just random stuff that doesn't really\nmake a lot of sense to anybody, right?\n\n319\n00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:35.440\nIf you think about it, so\nthis was called the ADFGVX Cipher.\n\n320\n00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:40.140\nThis was, again, used in the more modern\ntimes, used by the German military,\n\n321\n00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:41.290\namong others.\n\n322\n00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:43.200\nIt was used for a while, but again,\n\n323\n00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.110\nit became something that\nultimately could be cracked.\n\n324\n00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:50.580\nAs people started to create communications\nthat were not just sent by writing,\n\n325\n00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:51.750\nand sent my human.\n\n326\n00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:54.020\nBut we started to broadcast through radio.\n\n327\n00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:57.120\nRadio starts to become important in\nthe end of the first world war into\n\n328\n00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.240\nthe second world war.\n\n329\n00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:02.320\nThe intervening time period there in the\n20s and 30's into the 40's and the 1900s.\n\n330\n00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:06.490\nBecomes a time where we start to\nreally see technology take off.\n\n331\n00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:12.070\nAnd as a result, we have technology that\nallows us to intersect these messages and\n\n332\n00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:15.410\nwork on them in near real time,\nand that becomes a problem for\n\n333\n00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:18.530\nwhat I would say are still\nsimplistic ciphers like this.\n\n334\n00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:22.980\nEven though they look complex, right but\nwhen you then have a group of people that\n\n335\n00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:27.600\ncan intersect and work with them they\nare not so complex as we come to find out.\n\n336\n00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.970\nSo we have this,\nwe talked about the Enigma machine,\n\n337\n00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:34.080\nkind of rounding out our history or\nour thought process,\n\n338\n00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.210\nthe arc of history with cryptography,\nhitting some of the key highlights.\n\n339\n00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:39.070\nWe talked about the Enigma machine.\n\n340\n00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:43.510\nIf you'll give me a second I will show\nyou what an Enigma machine looked like.\n\n341\n00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:45.600\n&gt;&gt; And this was used predominantly when,\nWorld War II?\n\n342\n00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:49.120\n&gt;&gt; The Enigma machine was used\nbetween the two world wars.\n\n343\n00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.990\nThe Japanese had a version of this.\n\n344\n00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:53.620\nThe Germans had a version\nof this that became,\n\n345\n00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:56.520\nwhat we think of as the Enigma\nmachine in Second World War.\n\n346\n00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:00.510\nBut this was a electrorotor-mechanical\nsystem in a box.\n\n347\n00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:01.910\nYou could see pictures of it.\n\n348\n00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:05.460\nActually went to,\nI was in Chicago several years ago.\n\n349\n00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.490\nJust click on a picture so you can see it.\n\n350\n00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:11.940\nI was in Chicago several years ago and\nwent to,\n\n351\n00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.260\nI was speaking at a security\nconference there, and\n\n352\n00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:20.210\nthey did the reception at\nthe Museum of Industry.\n\n353\n00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:24.490\nAnd they actually have a German U-boat\nthat was sunk, and they have\n\n354\n00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:29.110\none of the surviving Enigma machines that\nwas captured during the war on display.\n\n355\n00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:32.430\nSo actually got to see a real live\nEnigma machine which was kind of,\n\n356\n00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:34.260\nit was really actually very fascinating.\n\n357\n00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:38.580\nSo this is kind fo cool and you would see\nit looks like what we would think of as\n\n358\n00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:43.330\nbasically a strip down kind of basic\nversion of a manual type writer right?\n\n359\n00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:47.990\nNot sort of see these much anymore,\nwhen I went to school we had actual\n\n360\n00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:51.670\ntypewriters we didn't have even word\nprocessors let alone computers back then.\n\n361\n00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:55.150\nYou had good old fashion,\nput paper and roll it [SOUND] right,\n\n362\n00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:58.507\ngo back the other way,\ntypewriters that's what we used.\n\n363\n00:18:58.507 --> 00:18:59.766\nWe also had chisels and\n\n364\n00:18:59.766 --> 00:19:03.330\nstones where you could bang\nthings out when I was in school.\n\n365\n00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:06.530\nBut you could see here these are the\nrotors right up here, and they're spun.\n\n366\n00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:10.460\nIt's hard to tell in the picture,\nbut they're spun by a person.\n\n367\n00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:11.880\n&gt;&gt; They're dialed in.\n\n368\n00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.050\n&gt;&gt; They're dialed in essentially.\n\n369\n00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:16.640\nThere's a setting that then pops\nup in these windows right here\n\n370\n00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.700\nthat tells you what the letter or number\ncombination is for the sequence, and\n\n371\n00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:25.150\nthen as you are typing in as you can\nsee here on the keyboard you then\n\n372\n00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:30.640\nare transposing and shifting those letters\ninto whatever the encipherment will be.\n\n373\n00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:35.250\nAnd there was a way to add additional\ncomplexity by adding in and\n\n374\n00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:39.390\nplugging in additional items over so\nyou could extend this and\n\n375\n00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:42.210\nsome of the late versions\nin the war use six or\n\n376\n00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:46.510\nseven rotors and became very difficult for\nthe Allies to be able to crack.\n\n377\n00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:48.040\n&gt;&gt; Is that output gonna be on paper?\n\n378\n00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.340\nIs it gonna be electrical?\n\n379\n00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:51.330\n&gt;&gt; It actually went, it depended.\n\n380\n00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:56.370\nThey could print out on paper, but\nthey normally were able to then send that\n\n381\n00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:59.930\nover the wire using radio, or Morse code,\nor whatever they would have done.\n\n382\n00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:02.670\nSo they were actually\ntransmitting this electronically.\n\n383\n00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:04.160\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; Again, the beginnings of what you\n\n384\n00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.530\nwould think was a modern\n&gt;&gt; What we would think\n\n385\n00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:10.200\nof as a proto typical modern\ncomputing system for communications.\n\n386\n00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:13.150\nNowhere near as complex as what we\nhave today, but this would of been\n\n387\n00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:19.200\nthe beginnings of send and receive\nstations sending bits over the wire.\n\n388\n00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:19.900\nAnd as a result,\n\n389\n00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:23.650\nessentially were the very early\nforerunners of modern computing networks.\n\n390\n00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:24.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n391\n00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.480\n&gt;&gt; Closed circuit systems that\nreally were just two endpoints.\n\n392\n00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.950\nRight, this was not the Internet,\nthere was no Google back then.\n\n393\n00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:34.520\nRight, but you were communicating back and\nforth on a type of network, essentially.\n\n394\n00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.770\nSo, kinda interesting when\nyou take a look at that.\n\n395\n00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:38.230\nAll right, let's do the following.\n\n396\n00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:42.850\nI'm gonna switch over here, and just go to\na different machine, for just a second.\n\n397\n00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:44.490\nAnd we’re gonna do another demo,\n\n398\n00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:46.900\nI’m just gonna bring up\na different desktop for you.\n\n399\n00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.350\nIt looks identical to the first one,\nit is essentially the same machine.\n\n400\n00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:53.790\nBut through the magic of ITProTV, we’re\ngonna make it appear different to you.\n\n401\n00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:54.570\nIt is a different machine,\n\n402\n00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:58.860\nI’m just installing software on some\ndesktops and doing demos on others,\n\n403\n00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:03.180\njust based on how simple it is to get\nto certain resources we wanna show you.\n\n404\n00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:07.000\nWhat I want to show you\nhere is a couple of tools.\n\n405\n00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.220\nWe're gonna focus on Cryptool right now,\nCryptool 2, the current version.\n\n406\n00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:14.660\nFor those of you that want to play with\nsome of the ciphers we talked about,\n\n407\n00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:18.410\nexamine them, see what they look like,\nCryptool is a phenomenal resource.\n\n408\n00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:21.650\nIt's an open-source cryptography\ndevelopment platform,\n\n409\n00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:23.370\nfreely available on the web.\n\n410\n00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:26.310\nWe've got the URL in the show notes so\nyou can obviously go out and\n\n411\n00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:27.300\ntake a look at it.\n\n412\n00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:31.020\nThere's two versions of Cryptool, I'm\ngonna use the newer version, Cryptool 2,\n\n413\n00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.120\na little bit newer.\n\n414\n00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:37.270\nYou do need the .Net Framework for\nthis, it does say this right here.\n\n415\n00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:38.980\nIf we could just go full screen for\na minute, just so\n\n416\n00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:40.710\nthey could see all\nthe background material there.\n\n417\n00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:42.230\nYou'll see it does run on Windows,\n\n418\n00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:45.070\nwe do need the dot net framework\nto be able to make that work.\n\n419\n00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:46.610\nJust so you can see.\n\n420\n00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:48.810\nSo, there are nightly builds of this.\n\n421\n00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:52.980\nAnd you would just download the most\nrecent build off the web that is compiled.\n\n422\n00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.820\nThere's a little disclaimer there,\nhey, it's a work in progress.\n\n423\n00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:59.100\nSome features are always new,\nin beta, working,\n\n424\n00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:01.280\nnot working, kind of as is, right.\n\n425\n00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.050\nCaveat emptor, buyer beware.\n\n426\n00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:05.790\nBut download the latest stable builds.\n\n427\n00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:07.770\nThere is a little .zip\nfile you can download.\n\n428\n00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:11.490\nThere is an executable,\nI just downloaded the .exe installer.\n\n429\n00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:14.130\nSpun it up on Windows 10,\nI'm running Windows 10 desktop.\n\n430\n00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:16.690\nSo you can run this on any\nversion of Windows basically,\n\n431\n00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:20.840\nthat supports the .NET version\n4 framework, just so you know.\n\n432\n00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.060\nAnd then, there is a stable build here.\n\n433\n00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:26.780\nIf you want the rock solid, it's gonna\nwork no matter what build, go and\n\n434\n00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:28.430\ndo the stable version.\n\n435\n00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:32.870\nI downloaded the nightly build, the latest\nrelease and did that because we're gonna\n\n436\n00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:34.088\nlive on the edge here-\n&gt;&gt; Let's do it.\n\n437\n00:22:34.088 --> 00:22:35.250\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we're just gonna\n\n438\n00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:36.680\nhope that things work.\n\n439\n00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:37.270\nAnd if they don't?\n\n440\n00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:39.260\nWell, we're gonna blame somebody.\n\n441\n00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:40.461\nLet's blame Daniel, he's not around.\n\n442\n00:22:40.461 --> 00:22:41.393\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We can blame him.\n\n443\n00:22:41.393 --> 00:22:42.455\nSo I'm just gonna open this up.\n\n444\n00:22:42.455 --> 00:22:45.576\nI've already done the install, so we're\nnot gonna bother with, hey click here,\n\n445\n00:22:45.576 --> 00:22:46.700\nnext, next, next, right?\n\n446\n00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.090\nWe're just gonna spin it up for you.\n\n447\n00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:50.100\nBut I did want you to\nsee how it starts up.\n\n448\n00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:53.080\nSo it loads up here and\nthen once it goes up,\n\n449\n00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.900\ntakes just a minute to load the interface.\n\n450\n00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:57.560\nAnd then you're gonna have some options,\nkinda cool.\n\n451\n00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.290\nWe need to go back to full screen please.\n\n452\n00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:03.590\nSo you'll see here that we can\nsee the actual interface and\n\n453\n00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:07.940\nI already have the ADFGVX cipher up and\nrunning for us as a template.\n\n454\n00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:10.090\nSo, we can jump right in and\nplay with that one.\n\n455\n00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:13.760\nNice thing is you hover over the template,\ngives you a little history of it.\n\n456\n00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.130\nTells you how it was set up.\n\n457\n00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:16.500\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; Gives you a little information about\n\n458\n00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:17.500\nit, kinda cool.\n\n459\n00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:20.090\nRight, so the people that are maintaining\nthis, doing an awesome job.\n\n460\n00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:23.540\nOpen source software, as we've talked\nabout in some other shows in other\n\n461\n00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:27.510\ntopic areas, all maintained by a dedicated\ncommunity of individuals, typically.\n\n462\n00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:32.755\nEverybody contributes, usually minimal\nif any cost to acquire the software,\n\n463\n00:23:32.755 --> 00:23:36.230\nalmost without exception,\nit's always free.\n\n464\n00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:40.600\nThey may ask for donations to help support\ntheir efforts but essentially free.\n\n465\n00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.030\nSo you've got a dedicated group of people\nthat are just really passionate about\n\n466\n00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:48.170\ncryptography developing this platform,\nand they've done an incredible job.\n\n467\n00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:49.520\nA really, really awesome job.\n\n468\n00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.220\nCan't say enough good things about it.\n\n469\n00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:54.418\nReally encourage you to download\nthe tool and take a look at it.\n\n470\n00:23:54.418 --> 00:23:56.092\nSo what you get here when it opens up,\n\n471\n00:23:56.092 --> 00:23:58.590\nthere's a little area that\nlet's us kinda navigate.\n\n472\n00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:03.785\nWe have templates And so what we see\ndown here is we have Cryptography,\n\n473\n00:24:03.785 --> 00:24:07.412\nwe have Cryptanalysis,\nthese are categories.\n\n474\n00:24:07.412 --> 00:24:08.437\nWe have Hash functions.\n\n475\n00:24:08.437 --> 00:24:11.422\nWe'll be exploring some of\nthese in future episodes.\n\n476\n00:24:11.422 --> 00:24:13.670\nYou'll see me go back to\nthis tool from time to time.\n\n477\n00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:15.170\nWe have Mathematics, we have Codes,\n\n478\n00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:18.990\nwe have Protocols, we have Steganography\nexamples, and we have Tools.\n\n479\n00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:21.730\nSo we have a lot of different\nthings that we can use here.\n\n480\n00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:26.690\nWe're gonna go in, go all the way to the\ntop, we're gonna open up the Cryptography.\n\n481\n00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:29.468\nAnd we have a Classical and\na Modern area, and so\n\n482\n00:24:29.468 --> 00:24:31.977\nwe were talking about classical ciphers.\n\n483\n00:24:31.977 --> 00:24:36.465\nAnd so ADFGVX is there,\nthe Caesar Cipher's there,\n\n484\n00:24:36.465 --> 00:24:38.868\nthe Enigma cipher is there.\n\n485\n00:24:38.868 --> 00:24:43.753\nThe Hill Cipher we didn't talk about,\nM-138, different ones as you can see.\n\n486\n00:24:43.753 --> 00:24:48.740\nThe Navaho Code talking cipher,\nif you ever heard about that.\n\n487\n00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:51.858\nThe Windtalkers was what they were called,\nand there's a movie,\n\n488\n00:24:51.858 --> 00:24:55.547\nNicholas Cage is in that, during the\nSecond World War, based on a true story.\n\n489\n00:24:55.547 --> 00:25:00.433\nThe US Army recruited Native American\nIndian Navajo Indian members of\n\n490\n00:25:00.433 --> 00:25:05.748\nthe Navajo nation to use the Navajo\nlanguage as a code against the Japanese.\n\n491\n00:25:05.748 --> 00:25:10.691\nBecause nobody else spoke the language and\nit was an oral language, not written down.\n\n492\n00:25:10.691 --> 00:25:12.750\nSo if you didn't speak it,\nyou couldn't understand it.\n\n493\n00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:18.785\nIt was an unbreakable code to transmit and\nsend secure information during the war.\n\n494\n00:25:18.785 --> 00:25:22.337\nAnd there's very famous stories\nabout this because these people,\n\n495\n00:25:22.337 --> 00:25:23.583\nthe American Indians,\n\n496\n00:25:23.583 --> 00:25:26.963\nthe Navajos that were doing this\nwere essentially invaluable.\n\n497\n00:25:26.963 --> 00:25:30.229\nBecause if they got captured by\nthe Japanese and were tortured,\n\n498\n00:25:30.229 --> 00:25:32.900\nthey could essentially\ngive away the information.\n\n499\n00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:34.730\nThey could tell you how to break the code.\n\n500\n00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:37.507\nSo every one of them had\nprotectors assigned to them.\n\n501\n00:25:37.507 --> 00:25:41.529\nNicholas Cage plays one of these army\nguys that's protecting a code-talker,\n\n502\n00:25:41.529 --> 00:25:42.916\na Windtalker in the movie.\n\n503\n00:25:42.916 --> 00:25:46.372\nAnd were given orders that they had to\nkill these guys if they were in threat of\n\n504\n00:25:46.372 --> 00:25:47.182\nbeing captured.\n\n505\n00:25:47.182 --> 00:25:48.832\nBecause if they were captured alive,\n\n506\n00:25:48.832 --> 00:25:52.146\nthe thought process was the Japanese\nwould torture them until they talked.\n\n507\n00:25:52.146 --> 00:25:55.391\nSo every one of them, essentially,\nwas walking around with somebody\n\n508\n00:25:55.391 --> 00:25:58.530\ntrained to kill them, if they\nthought they were gonna be captured.\n\n509\n00:25:58.530 --> 00:25:59.980\nIt's a really fascinating story,\n\n510\n00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:02.160\njust when you think about\nthe history of some of this stuff.\n\n511\n00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.661\nSo there's a whole bunch of these here.\n\n512\n00:26:03.661 --> 00:26:06.545\nYou could see the Playfair Cipher's there,\nthey're all there.\n\n513\n00:26:06.545 --> 00:26:09.880\nIf you wanna go take a look at these,\nreally, really cool.\n\n514\n00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:15.000\nSo I loaded up the template for the\nADFGVX, so we're gonna go back to that.\n\n515\n00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.820\nSo, I'm gonna go up here and all you do\nis just double-click on this to load it.\n\n516\n00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:21.805\nI'm gonna bring this up and there we go.\n\n517\n00:26:21.805 --> 00:26:23.123\nCould we go full screen again, please?\n\n518\n00:26:23.123 --> 00:26:26.742\nWhat we'll see is that when\nyou bring up the interface,\n\n519\n00:26:26.742 --> 00:26:29.668\nwe have a graphical\nlayout of the algorithm.\n\n520\n00:26:29.668 --> 00:26:32.070\nAnd I'm gonna explain this to\nyou in a minute how it works.\n\n521\n00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:33.474\nThis is a flowchart, right?\n\n522\n00:26:33.474 --> 00:26:38.347\nThis looks like, and indeed is, a grid\nthat lays out all of the componentized or\n\n523\n00:26:38.347 --> 00:26:42.671\ncompartmentalized functions of\nthe algorithm broken out visually.\n\n524\n00:26:42.671 --> 00:26:45.660\nLetting you see them as it works and\nlets you play with them.\n\n525\n00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:46.590\nReally cool.\n\n526\n00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:49.369\nAnd then we have a little message area,\nlittle filter area,\n\n527\n00:26:49.369 --> 00:26:50.579\nall that stuff down here.\n\n528\n00:26:50.579 --> 00:26:53.463\nI'm just gonna get rid of this so\nthat we can see this full screen.\n\n529\n00:26:53.463 --> 00:26:55.620\nLittle bit easier to see\nwhat's happening in there.\n\n530\n00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:57.680\nAnd you may also wanna size this,\n\n531\n00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:01.240\nthe parameter area that starts\nout like this over here.\n\n532\n00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:04.534\nYou just wanna probably move that out of\nthe way, get that shoved over a little bit\n\n533\n00:27:04.534 --> 00:27:06.972\nso you got a little more screen and\nreal estate to work with.\n\n534\n00:27:06.972 --> 00:27:10.032\nThere's also this nice area down\nhere that lets me zoom in, and\n\n535\n00:27:10.032 --> 00:27:12.302\nI'm gonna use that to\nzoom in in just a minute.\n\n536\n00:27:12.302 --> 00:27:14.587\nBut you could see I'm at 100% right now,\nand\n\n537\n00:27:14.587 --> 00:27:16.832\nI can zoom in on a certain\ncomponent if I want to.\n\n538\n00:27:16.832 --> 00:27:19.533\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; So with the ADFGVX cipher, and\n\n539\n00:27:19.533 --> 00:27:23.810\nit's labeled,\neverything is labeled which is nice.\n\n540\n00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:26.060\nWe have the plain text area right here, so\n\n541\n00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:29.280\nthis is the information\nthat we want to encipher.\n\n542\n00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.390\nThis is gonna be what we\nwant to encode ultimately.\n\n543\n00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:36.340\nAnd so shpeel is the Word we're using,\nbut we can modify that, right?\n\n544\n00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:39.067\nSo we'll put something else\nin there in just a minute.\n\n545\n00:27:39.067 --> 00:27:42.602\nBut then once we're done with that,\nwe see the logical flow.\n\n546\n00:27:42.602 --> 00:27:46.598\nIt comes down into this function,\nthis component here,\n\n547\n00:27:46.598 --> 00:27:48.856\nwhich is our encrypt function.\n\n548\n00:27:48.856 --> 00:27:51.880\nAnd we have action encrypt,\ncipher variant.\n\n549\n00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:54.910\nI can reprogram the boxes and\nmake them do what I want.\n\n550\n00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:58.750\nI have the substitution password,\nso the actual password being used.\n\n551\n00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:04.450\nAnd then I can randomly generate the keys\nand then I have the decrypt function.\n\n552\n00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:07.280\nAnd then on the far right, I have\n\n553\n00:28:08.355 --> 00:28:12.925\nthe output function where I get the cipher\ntext and the decrypted cipher text.\n\n554\n00:28:12.925 --> 00:28:14.435\nSo this is gonna run through.\n\n555\n00:28:14.435 --> 00:28:15.965\n&gt;&gt; This is our whole crypto system?\n\n556\n00:28:15.965 --> 00:28:18.375\n&gt;&gt; This is, as we break my laptop,\nyes, thank you.\n\n557\n00:28:18.375 --> 00:28:22.027\nThis is our whole crypto\nsystem minus my laptop.\n\n558\n00:28:22.027 --> 00:28:25.062\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So Cherokee's absolutely right,\n\n559\n00:28:25.062 --> 00:28:27.422\nthis is my or our cryptosystem.\n\n560\n00:28:27.422 --> 00:28:30.347\nNotice how she took joint ownership of\nthat, even though I'm doing all the work.\n\n561\n00:28:30.347 --> 00:28:32.363\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But yes, it is our cryptosystem.\n\n562\n00:28:32.363 --> 00:28:33.658\nVery, very true.\n\n563\n00:28:33.658 --> 00:28:34.741\nAbsolutely correct.\n\n564\n00:28:34.741 --> 00:28:36.797\nAll right,\ngotta renegotiate my contract here.\n\n565\n00:28:36.797 --> 00:28:38.597\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Make sure I get full rights to that\n\n566\n00:28:38.597 --> 00:28:39.204\nwhen we do it.\n\n567\n00:28:39.204 --> 00:28:43.970\nSo what plain text do you wanna use,\nwhat do you wanna put in there?\n\n568\n00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:44.820\nChoose anything you want.\n\n569\n00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:45.580\n&gt;&gt; Coffee.\n\n570\n00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:47.450\n&gt;&gt; Coffee?\nOkay, good, no problem, let's do coffee.\n\n571\n00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:48.218\nCoffee's a good one.\n\n572\n00:28:48.218 --> 00:28:51.279\nAll right, so\nI'm gonna spell coffee, C-O-F-F-E-E.\n\n573\n00:28:51.279 --> 00:28:54.000\nIt's so\ngood we use two letters twice, right?\n\n574\n00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.050\nSo we get that whole\nfrequency thing going on.\n\n575\n00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:57.400\nAll right, so coffee's in there, right?\n\n576\n00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.024\nSo let's do that.\n\n577\n00:28:58.024 --> 00:28:59.445\nWe need to be full screen for this please.\n\n578\n00:28:59.445 --> 00:29:01.112\nSo let's go back, let's take a look.\n\n579\n00:29:01.112 --> 00:29:02.581\nSo coffee, okay?\n\n580\n00:29:02.581 --> 00:29:05.383\nAnd what we're gonna see is the following.\n\n581\n00:29:05.383 --> 00:29:09.455\nWe're gonna go ahead, and\nyou see right now nothing has been done,\n\n582\n00:29:09.455 --> 00:29:10.894\nno running of any kind.\n\n583\n00:29:10.894 --> 00:29:13.560\nAnd over here, let me just scroll\nover as we were a second ago.\n\n584\n00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:14.698\nNo output yet, right?\n\n585\n00:29:14.698 --> 00:29:17.245\nAnd so what we do once we set\nthis up is the following.\n\n586\n00:29:17.245 --> 00:29:19.354\nWe come up here,\ngot a little a play button,\n\n587\n00:29:19.354 --> 00:29:22.721\nstarts the execution in the current\nworkspace which is cool, right?\n\n588\n00:29:22.721 --> 00:29:25.342\nSo, we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna do that, let's run that.\n\n589\n00:29:25.342 --> 00:29:26.479\nIt runs through.\n\n590\n00:29:26.479 --> 00:29:29.231\nIt tells us that it's\nessentially been successful.\n\n591\n00:29:29.231 --> 00:29:31.800\nIt generates our information.\n\n592\n00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:37.096\nAnd you'll see up here on the right,\nthis is the encrypted cipher text string.\n\n593\n00:29:37.096 --> 00:29:41.864\nAnd this is actually our plain text,\nessentially, right?\n\n594\n00:29:41.864 --> 00:29:43.124\nThe decrypted cipher text.\n\n595\n00:29:43.124 --> 00:29:46.114\nThe message we started with,\ncoffee, would be encrypted.\n\n596\n00:29:46.114 --> 00:29:50.389\nAnd if we sent it, it would be that,\nthat's what we would send.\n\n597\n00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:51.419\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n598\n00:29:51.419 --> 00:29:53.234\n&gt;&gt; So that's how-\n&gt;&gt; That's faster than me trying to figure\n\n599\n00:29:53.234 --> 00:29:55.209\nthat out-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Than you' having a cipher\n\n600\n00:29:55.209 --> 00:29:56.897\nand having to first create the block.\n\n601\n00:29:56.897 --> 00:29:59.175\nAnd then actually running it through, but\n\n602\n00:29:59.175 --> 00:30:01.717\nthis is what the ADFGVX\ncipher would look like.\n\n603\n00:30:01.717 --> 00:30:04.627\nSo let's do one more, let's just go\nahead and let's load up one more.\n\n604\n00:30:04.627 --> 00:30:07.361\nDo you wanna do the Caesar Cipher?\n\n605\n00:30:07.361 --> 00:30:08.756\nYou want to do Playfair?\n\n606\n00:30:08.756 --> 00:30:09.630\nWhat do you wanna do?\n\n607\n00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:14.230\n&gt;&gt; Let's go in your favorite,\nand we will go with the Vigenère.\n\n608\n00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:16.520\n&gt;&gt; Vanier, let me just make sure\nVigenère is in here, one second.\n\n609\n00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:18.810\nThere's Vigenère right there, okay?\n\n610\n00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:20.350\nSo let's grab that one.\n\n611\n00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:21.485\nOkay, we'll do this.\n\n612\n00:30:21.485 --> 00:30:23.603\nGive me one second.\n\n613\n00:30:23.603 --> 00:30:25.225\nI don't know if it registered.\n\n614\n00:30:25.225 --> 00:30:27.672\n&gt;&gt; It's either that one, or\nthe someone in chat mentioned that one.\n\n615\n00:30:27.672 --> 00:30:29.737\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we actually haven't\ntalked that one yet, so let's-\n\n616\n00:30:29.737 --> 00:30:30.538\n&gt;&gt; Save it?\n\n617\n00:30:30.538 --> 00:30:31.853\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's do following.\n\n618\n00:30:31.853 --> 00:30:34.825\nLet me just go back here one second.\n\n619\n00:30:34.825 --> 00:30:38.003\nGo back, it's just not registering\nthe click, so let me just do it from here,\n\n620\n00:30:38.003 --> 00:30:39.124\njust to load it real quick.\n\n621\n00:30:39.124 --> 00:30:41.790\nYou know that whole mouse thing we\nkeep talking about on this machine?\n\n622\n00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:42.861\n&gt;&gt; Virtualization, yeah.\n\n623\n00:30:42.861 --> 00:30:44.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's do that.\n\n624\n00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:45.260\nThere we go.\nIt's loading now.\n\n625\n00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:46.620\nIt's just a matter of\ngetting it to load up.\n\n626\n00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:49.410\nAll right, so you can see the Vigenère\ncipher, a little bit different,\n\n627\n00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:51.878\ncause obviously it's got\na little bit of a different flow.\n\n628\n00:30:51.878 --> 00:30:55.830\nSo you could see here,\nwe have our plain text, we have our key.\n\n629\n00:30:55.830 --> 00:31:00.190\nThen we have our grid where we're\ndoing the encipherment through, so\n\n630\n00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:03.310\nit's gonna be the polyalphabetic, or\n\n631\n00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:07.060\nmultiple alphabets and\nthen we're gonna get out output over here.\n\n632\n00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:10.890\nSo we have our plain text,\nwhatever we choose to do.\n\n633\n00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:13.490\nThere's just variations\nof hello world in there,\n\n634\n00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:15.920\nbased on how we spell it\nin different languages.\n\n635\n00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.120\nSo let's do the following.\n\n636\n00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.250\nLet's just take all that out.\n\n637\n00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:23.330\nAnd what is it that we want to\nactually use for our plain text?\n\n638\n00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:24.450\n&gt;&gt; IT ProTV.\n\n639\n00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:25.350\n&gt;&gt; IT ProTV.\n\n640\n00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:27.140\nSo original, so original.\n\n641\n00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:32.056\nITProTV, we've got that.\n\n642\n00:31:32.056 --> 00:31:35.378\nAnd you can see our key here,\nour key is Turing,\n\n643\n00:31:35.378 --> 00:31:39.721\na very famous person in the history\nof cryptography, right?\n\n644\n00:31:39.721 --> 00:31:43.635\nIf you're not familiar with him you\nmay have seen a movie about his life,\n\n645\n00:31:43.635 --> 00:31:45.960\nbecause they did a famous movie about him.\n\n646\n00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:49.600\nWho plays him?\n\n647\n00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:50.628\n&gt;&gt; You're asking the wrong person.\n\n648\n00:31:50.628 --> 00:31:55.280\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, again, I'm just\nthinking of Benedict Cumberbatch plays\n\n649\n00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:00.108\nAlan Turing in the movie, and\nit's about his history as a mathematician.\n\n650\n00:32:00.108 --> 00:32:03.632\nHe was involved At Bletchley Park\nduring the second world war,\n\n651\n00:32:03.632 --> 00:32:05.837\nAlan Turing is the gentleman's name.\n\n652\n00:32:05.837 --> 00:32:09.807\nHe was involved as one of the lead\nmathematicians that built the decryption\n\n653\n00:32:09.807 --> 00:32:14.360\nsystems that allowed us to crack\nthe German and Japanese military ciphers.\n\n654\n00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:18.140\nAnd leads to the modern invention\nof what we think of as computers.\n\n655\n00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:21.040\nHis thought process, his writings, and\n\n656\n00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:26.080\nhis papers on the ideas mathematically and\nelectromechanically around\n\n657\n00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.530\ncomputers ultimately lead to establishment\nof all the technology we have today.\n\n658\n00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:32.070\nTuring was a brilliant,\nbrilliant mathematician.\n\n659\n00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:35.480\nHe was an Oxford don,\nhe was a very accomplished individual, and\n\n660\n00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:39.030\nwas part of that project, and\nwas one of the key instrumental movers and\n\n661\n00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:40.420\nshakers behind the scenes.\n\n662\n00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:43.170\nAnd us being able to read all that\ntraffic with his information and\n\n663\n00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:44.725\nthe way in which he approached this.\n\n664\n00:32:44.725 --> 00:32:49.180\nSo he's kind of a really seminal, really\nimportant figure in modern cryptography.\n\n665\n00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:51.210\nSo let's go back, let's take\na look at how we're gonna do this.\n\n666\n00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:55.580\nSo what we're gonna do is we'll leave\nhim as our key, right, since he is so\n\n667\n00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:57.040\nhistorically important to us.\n\n668\n00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:57.770\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n669\n00:32:57.770 --> 00:32:59.260\n&gt;&gt; And let's go ahead and\nlet's do the following.\n\n670\n00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:00.340\nLet's run this through.\n\n671\n00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:00.910\nWe'll do play.\n\n672\n00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:06.396\nAnd you could see here,\nITPro.TV with a key of Turing,\n\n673\n00:33:06.396 --> 00:33:09.300\nrun through the veneer cipher blocks.\n\n674\n00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:12.880\nAnd we see out over here that we get our\n\n675\n00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:18.060\ntext style put in cypher text\nb n g z b z o, it looks like.\n\n676\n00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:22.860\nAnd then a notice, just interestingly\nenough, I capitalized IT PRO,\n\n677\n00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:24.050\nleft t v lowercase.\n\n678\n00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:27.900\nThere's no impact on the actual\nencryption decryption, but\n\n679\n00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:31.760\nit outputs as you can see,\njust based on how the system is written,\n\n680\n00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.890\nit outputs in upper case\nlowercase the same way.\n\n681\n00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:37.360\nSo it's kind of interesting that it did\nthat because you see the ZO on the end.\n\n682\n00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:41.399\nRight, if I change it and we go back and\ndo this all capitals right,\n\n683\n00:33:41.399 --> 00:33:44.000\nyou see it changes for us in real time.\n\n684\n00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.090\nSo it's just a quirk of how the interface\nis written, and the real example,\n\n685\n00:33:48.090 --> 00:33:51.510\nif it were actually real example rather\nin the real implementation of this.\n\n686\n00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:54.540\nBack in the day that would have made\nno difference, cuz you would have done\n\n687\n00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:57.130\neverything in upper case or lower case,\njust depending on how you did it.\n\n688\n00:33:57.130 --> 00:34:00.830\nBut it's just interesting that here it\njust adjusts for us in real time, so\n\n689\n00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:01.820\nit's kind of cool.\n\n690\n00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:05.710\nSo we can do this, we actually also,\nyou can see here we can add an image,\n\n691\n00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:06.920\nwe can put in pictures.\n\n692\n00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:08.725\nWe could screen capture this stuff and\n\n693\n00:34:08.725 --> 00:34:13.610\nuse it if you're maybe doing a project for\nschool.\n\n694\n00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:15.860\nAnd you got to actually\nshow how this stuff works.\n\n695\n00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:17.941\nI use this with my students\nin cartography classes.\n\n696\n00:34:17.941 --> 00:34:19.394\n&gt;&gt; Now Adam, on the exam,\n\n697\n00:34:19.394 --> 00:34:23.400\nare we going to need to decipher\nfrom using these types of basic?\n\n698\n00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:24.010\n&gt;&gt; Good question.\n\n699\n00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:27.427\nYou may be given a grid and be asked\nto decipher a message or encipher it.\n\n700\n00:34:27.427 --> 00:34:29.010\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; It could be one way to do it.\n\n701\n00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:31.420\nYou won't have, obviously this\nsoftware makes it simple, right,\n\n702\n00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:32.540\nyou won't have this.\n\n703\n00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:36.430\nBut you may be given some basic thought\nprocesses that you may have to manipulate.\n\n704\n00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:40.800\nA lot of it may be just rote\nmemorization in the sense of, hey,\n\n705\n00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:44.060\nthis cypher was created by so\nand so, yo, who was this person?\n\n706\n00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:46.700\nI could see for\ninstance a list of ciphers on one side,\n\n707\n00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:50.770\na list of the names of people that created\nthem or facts about them on the other.\n\n708\n00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:53.290\nMix and match, drag and drop,\nthere's a lot of ways to choose.\n\n709\n00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:55.130\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; All sorts of stuff.\n\n710\n00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:58.440\nSo, you won't see this particular piece\nof software, but it's a great way for\n\n711\n00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:01.180\nyou to visualize these algorithms and\nplay with them.\n\n712\n00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:04.340\nAnd you can see if you go to the modern\nside, we've got the more modern ones.\n\n713\n00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:07.020\nWe were mentioning DAS and\ntriple DAS and all that.\n\n714\n00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:07.760\nAll of those are there.\n\n715\n00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.059\nYou could play with any and all of these,\nthis is part of that process.\n\n716\n00:35:10.059 --> 00:35:12.260\nSo it's really kind of neat software.\n\n717\n00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:15.599\nI love it, and just as i said I can't\nsay enough good things about the people\n\n718\n00:35:15.599 --> 00:35:18.408\nthat are behind it because of\nthe work they do and the ability for\n\n719\n00:35:18.408 --> 00:35:21.217\nus to then use it and to educate and\nto show and to interact with so\n\n720\n00:35:21.217 --> 00:35:24.105\nthat people can get a better\nunderstanding of this technology.\n\n721\n00:35:24.105 --> 00:35:25.980\nIt's a fabulous, fabulous tool.\n\n722\n00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:28.460\nSo cryptool.org,\nyou should definitely take a look at.\n\n723\n00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:29.780\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for\nsharing that with us.\n\n724\n00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:33.884\nAnd also adding to my playlist of movies\nthere that I need to watch, as well.\n\n725\n00:35:33.884 --> 00:35:35.790\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Windtalkers, great one.\n\n726\n00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:36.520\nReally good.\n\n727\n00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:38.690\n&gt;&gt; Looks like we're at the end\nof our first section here.\n\n728\n00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:41.360\nBut we do have additional chapters to go,\nso stay tuned.\n\n729\n00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:43.140\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this show.\n\n730\n00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.750\nRemember I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n731\n00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:45.680\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n732\n00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:49.479\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n733\n00:35:49.479 --> 00:35:55.559\n[MUSIC]\n\n734\n00:35:55.559 --> 00:35:58.705\nThank you for watching

00:00:11.673\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.673 --> 00:00:14.135\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your EICES series.\n\n5\n00:00:14.135 --> 00:00:16.583\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:20.616\nIn this episode, you will be given a set\nof definitions to help you navigate\n\n7\n00:00:20.616 --> 00:00:22.910\nthrough the sea of cryptography.\n\n8\n00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.280\nWith us today we have\nCaptain Adam Gordon to lead the way.\n\n9\n00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.090\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n10\n00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.150\n&gt;&gt; Well, that was quite\na nautical theme for navigation.\n\n11\n00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.510\nThat was so cute how she did that.\n\n12\n00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.550\nYay, good job.\n\n13\n00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.900\nI am your captain of cryptography.\n\n14\n00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.730\nIf we're gonna go,\nwe might as well go all the way.\n\n15\n00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:41.810\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n16\n00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.380\nLet's do it.\n\n17\n00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.110\n&gt;&gt; So, let's continue our conversation.\n\n18\n00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.530\nCherokee set us up really nicely for\nour conversation discussion.\n\n19\n00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.260\nIn this particular episode, what we're\ngonna do, she's gonna help me out.\n\n20\n00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.290\nAnd together, we're gonna spend\nsome time talking about vocabulary.\n\n21\n00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.930\nWe've been talking a lot up until\nnow about the concepts The ideas,\n\n22\n00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.470\nsome of the background and\nthe history, right?\n\n23\n00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.390\nSome of the interesting historic little\nfacts and things associated with this.\n\n24\n00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.170\nBut what we haven't really done until\nnow is actually laid out the specific\n\n25\n00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.800\nvocabulary and the strict definitions,\nright, of what these terms mean.\n\n26\n00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.230\nWe've talked about keys.\n\n27\n00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.740\nWe've talked about The idea of\nconfidentiality and integrity.\n\n28\n00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.090\nWe've talked about encrypt and\ndecrypt, encode,\n\n29\n00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.330\ndecode, encipher, decipher,\nplain text, cypher text.\n\n30\n00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.290\nBut we haven't really strictly defined\nthese terms, and what I wanna do, and\n\n31\n00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.980\nwhat we wanna do,\nis walk you through these terms,\n\n32\n00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.620\ngive you the ability to understand the\nvocabulary and the language that we speak\n\n33\n00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.010\nwith regards to encryption and\ndecryption, with regards to cryptography.\n\n34\n00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.230\nAnd then, as we go through that,\ntell you some stories,\n\n35\n00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.670\nhelp you to better understand the terms\nthrough example word and deed.\n\n36\n00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.770\nAnd hopefully, at the end of that\nconversation, and it may wind up\n\n37\n00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.600\nbeing a two part episode conversation, cuz\nwe do have a lot of terms to get through.\n\n38\n00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.140\nGive you the foundational\nknowledge that is we then\n\n39\n00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.050\ntake you further into these conversations,\nand go deeply into symmetric and\n\n40\n00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.380\nasymmetric cryptography, you have a better\nunderstanding of what we're gonna do,\n\n41\n00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.820\nhow we're gonna talk about it, and\nas ultimately certified encryption\n\n42\n00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.960\nspecialists, how you're gonna implement\ncryptography, and use it to protect, and\n\n43\n00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.320\nprovide for\nconfidentiality within the real world.\n\n44\n00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.280\nSo, let's begin,\nif we can go to the screen and\n\n45\n00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.330\ntake look at our Discussion points.\n\n46\n00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.290\nWe've got our vocabulary up on the screen.\n\n47\n00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.060\nWe're gonna do a little discussion/show\nand tell along the way here.\n\n48\n00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.070\nSo, we're gonna start with what would may\nactually look a little bit out of order\n\n49\n00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.650\nand we're gonna go down the list.\n\n50\n00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.195\nThere is.\nIs a method to the madness, believe or\n\n51\n00:02:37.195 --> 00:02:40.125\nnot, and\nwe're gonna start right at the beginning,\n\n52\n00:02:40.125 --> 00:02:43.765\nwith defining some of the basic terms or\nrather jump into certain area and\n\n53\n00:02:43.765 --> 00:02:46.435\ntalk about some functionality\nthat's not gonna\n\n54\n00:02:46.435 --> 00:02:50.967\ncircle back as we go through this list,\nto help us understand more broad concepts.\n\n55\n00:02:50.967 --> 00:02:54.697\nThe entire vocabulary list is gonna be\navailable as part of the show notes, so\n\n56\n00:02:54.697 --> 00:02:56.007\nyou're gonna have that.\n\n57\n00:02:56.007 --> 00:02:59.977\nAnd, encourage you to download that, take\na look at it, use it as a study guide,\n\n58\n00:02:59.977 --> 00:03:01.537\nessentially an outline or\n\n59\n00:03:01.537 --> 00:03:04.737\nthe beginning sketch of an outline\nyou could add your notes to.\n\n60\n00:03:04.737 --> 00:03:08.850\nWe, actually Cherokee and\nI were talking about it before the.\n\n61\n00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.970\nThe show and you know,\nI explained it to her.\n\n62\n00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.060\nMore like being literally the skeleton,\nright?\n\n63\n00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.110\nOr the outline you can build on so\nyou could add, as Cherokee was doing,\n\n64\n00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.335\nall the details and\nnotes she wants to make.\n\n65\n00:03:20.335 --> 00:03:21.910\n[LAUGH] Add to the conversation,\n\n66\n00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.750\nthings she wants to make sure we cover,\nkeeping me honest.\n\n67\n00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.290\nMaking sure I'm talking about\nthings that are important.\n\n68\n00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.930\nBut this will help you to be\nable to get the basics, right?\n\n69\n00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.280\nThe core functionality,\nmost important definitional concepts, but\n\n70\n00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.710\nthen add your own specificity for\nthings you wanna know or remember.\n\n71\n00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.700\nI also wanna know and\nthink about the concept here\n\n72\n00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.150\nof using flash cards as a good\nstudy guide or steady way to do,\n\n73\n00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.920\nor way to do studying If you will, a tool\nthat can help you to better prepare.\n\n74\n00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.040\nNot that we necessarily recommend or don't\nrecommend any one approach over another.\n\n75\n00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.260\nBut flashcards in\nparticular with vocabulary\n\n76\n00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.080\ntends to be helpful from a memorization\nand learning standpoint.\n\n77\n00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.790\nAnd it may be helpful to go out\nto a site like quizlet.com and\n\n78\n00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.820\nthey have all sorts of\nflash card sets there.\n\n79\n00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.240\nThey've go Crytopgraphy\nflash cards from CISSP,\n\n80\n00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.670\nfrom CASP,\nfrom other security certifications\n\n81\n00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.430\nthat will roughly be approximate to\nthe definitions we go through here.\n\n82\n00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.540\nWhen we talk about synchronous and\nasynchronous hashing, key clustering,\n\n83\n00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.660\nthese are concepts irrespective of\nthe vendor and the certification.\n\n84\n00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.410\nThey're defined the same way for\neverybody.\n\n85\n00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.770\nSo, if you get flash cards that address\nthem, and speak to them in one area,\n\n86\n00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.400\nyou're gonna be able to use those to\nstudy regardless of the Vendor and\n\n87\n00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.680\nthe specific exam that you may be\nsitting for or in some way going after.\n\n88\n00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.000\nSo, just keep that in\nmind as we get started.\n\n89\n00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.540\nPublic service announcement\nfrom us here at ITPro.TV,\n\n90\n00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.270\nhelping you to study better and\n\n91\n00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.700\nget ready to become certified encryption\nspecialists in this particular case.\n\n92\n00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.750\nSo, let's start by talking about\nkey clustering a little bit.\n\n93\n00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.230\nSo, do you ever when you go and?\n\n94\n00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.260\nCherokee, maybe you can either go home or\nyou go take the car or\n\n95\n00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.880\nwhatever you may do when you go out.\n\n96\n00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.000\nDo you have to a key chain\nwith more than one key on it?\n\n97\n00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.400\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; So, you probably have, like I said,\n\n98\n00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.600\nyour car key, all right,\nI'm sure your house key.\n\n99\n00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.130\nYou may have keys for other things,\na variety of things, whatever they may be.\n\n100\n00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.940\nAnd so the idea is you carry\naround a lot of keys with you.\n\n101\n00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.990\nAnd you have to figure out a way to\nunderstand which keys are useful and\n\n102\n00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.890\nmore specific to certain functions.\n\n103\n00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.280\nYou don't want to put your house key in\nthe car and try to start your car up.\n\n104\n00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.560\nThat doesn't work for a while, right?\n\n105\n00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.940\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So we want to keep track of our keys,\n\n106\n00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:22.970\nnumber one.\n\n107\n00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.320\nAnd we want to understand that grouping\nthem together by functionality, in theory,\n\n108\n00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.510\ncould be one way to do this.\n\n109\n00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:29.230\nBut.\n\n110\n00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.830\nWhat we have to understand is the key\nclustering here doesn't mean the same\n\n111\n00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.950\nthing as it does in the real world, where\nCherokee tries to keep track of her keys.\n\n112\n00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.710\n&gt;&gt; I've got Hello Kitty, and Anna and Elsa\nfor the house, and so forth and so forth.\n\n113\n00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.710\nThe guitar for the shed.\n\n114\n00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.235\nThe, or whatever.\n\n115\n00:05:43.235 --> 00:05:46.015\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so you've got the-\n&gt;&gt; You ever been to Home Depot?\n\n116\n00:05:46.015 --> 00:05:47.085\nThey have different little colors.\n\n117\n00:05:47.085 --> 00:05:50.035\n&gt;&gt; Right, they have the keys or\nlittle themes you can put on them,\n\n118\n00:05:50.035 --> 00:05:52.455\nalmost like wrapping your car or\nsomething.\n\n119\n00:05:52.455 --> 00:05:54.255\nRight, so I have like a tropical motif for\n\n120\n00:05:54.255 --> 00:05:58.475\nmy house key, because I'm usually in cold\nclimates quite often when I'm working.\n\n121\n00:05:58.475 --> 00:06:03.410\nSo, I have a little like Hawaiian flower,\ntropical motif thing going on from.\n\n122\n00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:04.930\n&gt;&gt; And now we all know.\n\n123\n00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.960\n&gt;&gt; And now we all know, and\nwe know you like Hello Kitty.\n\n124\n00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.290\nSo, we have two pieces\nof very important and\n\n125\n00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.270\ntotally useless information that\nwe've shared with you here.\n\n126\n00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.660\nSo, when we think about key clustering\nwith regards to cryptography,\n\n127\n00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:16.790\na little bit different, right?\n\n128\n00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.615\nWe're not worried about keeping track of\nall the keys and understanding what they\n\n129\n00:06:20.615 --> 00:06:23.617\ndo from a functionality perspective\nPer se, but indeed we are.\n\n130\n00:06:23.617 --> 00:06:26.948\nit's just kind of layer below\nwhat we have to define initially.\n\n131\n00:06:26.948 --> 00:06:29.675\nThe idea of key clustering\nis taking a key.\n\n132\n00:06:29.675 --> 00:06:34.179\nAnd the key itself is defined as\nthe item that allows us to either drive\n\n133\n00:06:34.179 --> 00:06:36.673\nthe encryption or decryption cycle.\n\n134\n00:06:36.673 --> 00:06:41.995\nIt's a secret ingredient, right, that we\nadd in to the encryption or decryption\n\n135\n00:06:41.995 --> 00:06:46.851\nformula that allow us to actually take\nplain text, add it to an algorithm,\n\n136\n00:06:46.851 --> 00:06:52.360\nuse the key to drive the process forward\nto an encrypt or reverse it and decrypt.\n\n137\n00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.910\nAnd by using the key to the algorithm,\nand the input, we get cypher text out.\n\n138\n00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:00.830\nWhereby using cipher text to key in\nthe algorithm as input we get plain text.\n\n139\n00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.570\nSo, any other way, depending on\nwhether we go forwards or backwards.\n\n140\n00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:07.640\nAnd so, the key itself is vital to\nour ability to be able to encrypt and\n\n141\n00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.490\ndecrypt and we'll talk in a bit\nabout different kinds of keys.\n\n142\n00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:14.750\nThere is a private key and there is\na public key, and if we have public and\n\n143\n00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.920\nprivate keys working together,\nwe have what's known as a key pair.\n\n144\n00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.570\nIf we have a single key,\nwe have only a private key.\n\n145\n00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.800\nAnd we then have to decide\nwhat kind of key we're using.\n\n146\n00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:29.340\nWe also want to be aware of the fact that\nprivate keys, like the name implies,\n\n147\n00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:33.160\nprivate, they have to be kept secret or\nkept secure as we say.\n\n148\n00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.336\nThere's actually a principle involved\nhere that we will refer to as\n\n149\n00:07:36.336 --> 00:07:37.629\nKerckhoffs' Principle.\n\n150\n00:07:37.629 --> 00:07:42.058\nAuguste Kerckhoffs, the gentleman who\ncame up with this idea in the late\n\n151\n00:07:42.058 --> 00:07:46.779\n1800s postulated and has come to be\nproven correct, and we refer to it now\n\n152\n00:07:46.779 --> 00:07:50.919\nas Kerckhoffs' Principle as a result\nThat the entire crypto system\n\n153\n00:07:50.919 --> 00:07:54.796\ncan be known to the adversary as\nlong as the private key itself.\n\n154\n00:07:54.796 --> 00:07:58.629\nIs kept secure, and as a result if\nwe keep the private key secure,\n\n155\n00:07:58.629 --> 00:08:02.882\nwe don't allow anybody to know what\nthe private key is except the owner,\n\n156\n00:08:02.882 --> 00:08:05.760\nthe person that uses it and\noperates the system.\n\n157\n00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.360\nAs long as we keep that secure then\n\n158\n00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.950\nthe attacker couldn't in\ntheory have the cipher text.\n\n159\n00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:15.190\nThe attacker may know the algorithm or\nalgorithms if there's more than one and\n\n160\n00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.250\nyou're choosing.\n\n161\n00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:20.110\nBut as long as we don't expose the private\nkey the attacker, the bad actor,\n\n162\n00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:23.330\nthe threat source, those individuals,\n\n163\n00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:28.360\nthose entities, they're not gonna be\nable to easily take that cipher text and\n\n164\n00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.620\nthe knowledge of that algorithm\nmaking up the crypto system and\n\n165\n00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.480\nthey're not gonna be able to do\nanything with it unless they get lucky.\n\n166\n00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.060\nThey may guess what the key\nis just by brute forcing,\n\n167\n00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:39.050\ngoing through multiple iterations.\n\n168\n00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:41.950\nBut, unless they actually\nhave knowledge of the key,\n\n169\n00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:45.922\nit would be an unlikely scenario that\nthey would decrypt that cypher text in\n\n170\n00:08:45.922 --> 00:08:49.658\na reasonable amount of time as we've\ntalked about in other episodes.\n\n171\n00:08:49.658 --> 00:08:53.423\nAnd so, key clustering is something that\npresents a significant challenge for\n\n172\n00:08:53.423 --> 00:08:55.333\nus because kinda like in the real world,\n\n173\n00:08:55.333 --> 00:08:57.970\ngrouping our keys together\nbased on function.\n\n174\n00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.985\nWe like that in the real world\ncuz that keeps us on track.\n\n175\n00:09:00.985 --> 00:09:02.460\nWe know we've got these five keys.\n\n176\n00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.477\nThey're hello kitty keys so\nthey work for, what did you say, home or\n\n177\n00:09:05.477 --> 00:09:06.631\nwhatever it was, right?\n\n178\n00:09:06.631 --> 00:09:09.190\nAnd we know we have those selections.\n\n179\n00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:11.140\nThe exact opposite's true\nin the crypto system.\n\n180\n00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.648\nIf we have key clustering,\nwe have a problem.\n\n181\n00:09:13.648 --> 00:09:16.761\nAny time we have sameness,\nany time we have a pattern,\n\n182\n00:09:16.761 --> 00:09:19.660\nany time we have something\nwe can anticipate.\n\n183\n00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:23.130\nWe can look ahead and more or\nless guess what is gonna happen?\n\n184\n00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:25.821\nThis is a weakness that is\nunacceptable in a cryptosystem.\n\n185\n00:09:25.821 --> 00:09:27.540\nBecause it's gonna lead to compromise.\n\n186\n00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.850\nAnd so, key clustering,\ndifferent encryption keys generating\n\n187\n00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:34.880\nsame cipher text from the same plain\ntext message creates a pattern, and\n\n188\n00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.200\nwhen we have patterns over time we\npotentially end up with a weakness\n\n189\n00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.530\nthat can lead to the exposure of\nthe plain text from the cipher text.\n\n190\n00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:48.432\nSo in other words we can decrypt in theory\none or more messages by guessing the key.\n\n191\n00:09:48.432 --> 00:09:52.180\nAnd as a result not only get that\nparticular plain text message, but\n\n192\n00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:56.453\nany plain text that had be in cipher,\nhad been run through the crypto system,\n\n193\n00:09:56.453 --> 00:09:57.850\nusing that key.\n\n194\n00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:01.926\nSo one thing if we use a one time key we\nusually literally throw it away at most we\n\n195\n00:10:01.926 --> 00:10:06.133\nexposed a single message we may lose the\nconfidentiality of that one message but\n\n196\n00:10:06.133 --> 00:10:09.899\nyou would have to guess the right key\nevery time and are always different\n\n197\n00:10:09.899 --> 00:10:14.080\nconsistently to be able to break\nthe system in an on going basis.\n\n198\n00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.290\nImpossible to do.\n\n199\n00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:18.600\nThe only truly unbreakable\ncryptosystem today that's implemented\n\n200\n00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.680\ncorrectly continues to be\nthe one-time pad, right?\n\n201\n00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.160\nSo that's not something we worry\nabout on a one-time use system.\n\n202\n00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.300\nBut most systems are not\ndesigned this way.\n\n203\n00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.360\nAnd even when they are, it's very\nhard to implement them successfully\n\n204\n00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.950\nbecause of a lot of the variables that go\ninto implementing a one-time system or\n\n205\n00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:36.360\na one-time pad.\n\n206\n00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.876\nSo the reality is, we tend to reuse keys.\n\n207\n00:10:38.876 --> 00:10:43.609\nAnd if we reuse them often enough without\nenough distance or time between the use of\n\n208\n00:10:43.609 --> 00:10:48.344\nthe key and the next use of the key, the\niteration, people may start to monitor and\n\n209\n00:10:48.344 --> 00:10:51.795\nthen Indeed develop\nan understanding of the pattern.\n\n210\n00:10:51.795 --> 00:10:55.150\nThis ultimately is what lead to\nthe breakdown and the problems with WEP,\n\n211\n00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:58.725\nthe Wired Equivalent Protocol, or\nthe Wired Equivalent Privacy Protocol.\n\n212\n00:10:58.725 --> 00:10:59.444\n&gt;&gt; Does initialization affect this?\n\n213\n00:10:59.444 --> 00:11:03.007\n&gt;&gt; That was used initially for\nWireless Trader 2.11.\n\n214\n00:11:03.007 --> 00:11:06.205\nIt was bad it was short IV.\n\n215\n00:11:06.205 --> 00:11:09.520\nThe IV was a 24 bit IV\ninstead of a bigger one.\n\n216\n00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.760\nAnd it was bad implementation\nof the RC4 algorithm.\n\n217\n00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.790\nThe algorithm itself, that under WEP.\n\n218\n00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:20.080\nRC4 is actually still a valid algorithm\nand it's still considered to be secure.\n\n219\n00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.277\nBut the problem, at least for\ncertain functions anyway.\n\n220\n00:11:22.277 --> 00:11:25.899\nBut the problem is it was implemented\npoorly because of a low or\n\n221\n00:11:25.899 --> 00:11:27.921\nsmall IV initialization vector or\n\n222\n00:11:27.921 --> 00:11:32.610\nrandomness injection of randomness\nat the beginning of the key stream.\n\n223\n00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:36.310\nAnd also a small workspace and\na small key factor.\n\n224\n00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:40.041\nThe amount of time it took to\nrepeat the keys was very small.\n\n225\n00:11:40.041 --> 00:11:42.550\nAnd the number of keys\nused was very small.\n\n226\n00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:45.812\nBecause in the beginning, nobody thought\nwireless would actually be popular.\n\n227\n00:11:45.812 --> 00:11:48.200\nAnd it turned out to\nbe incredibly popular.\n\n228\n00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.147\nSo much traffic was sent through it\nthat the key space was not big enough.\n\n229\n00:11:51.147 --> 00:11:53.700\nAnd we repeated keys so quickly.\n\n230\n00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:58.080\nThat monitoring software could pick up on\nthis get every permutation of the key and\n\n231\n00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:02.920\nessentially find every key needed to\ncrack the encryption in a very small\n\n232\n00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.010\namount of time.\n\n233\n00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:06.829\nAnd because of that we will be able to\nread all the traffic regardless of what\n\n234\n00:12:06.829 --> 00:12:07.383\nkey was used.\n\n235\n00:12:07.383 --> 00:12:10.016\nSo that was why ultimately\nWEP became a problem.\n\n236\n00:12:10.016 --> 00:12:13.410\nAnd key clustering was one of\nthe issues associated with this.\n\n237\n00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:16.650\nSo when different keys\ngenerate the same cipher text\n\n238\n00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:20.400\nCipher text is encrypted text or\noutput in our crypto system.\n\n239\n00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.440\nWhen it generates the same cipher\ntext from the same plain text.\n\n240\n00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:27.119\nPlain text is the unencrypted text like\nwhat you see on the screen in front of you\n\n241\n00:12:27.119 --> 00:12:27.636\ngoing in.\n\n242\n00:12:27.636 --> 00:12:30.500\nSo plain text is input,\ncipher text is output.\n\n243\n00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.500\nWhen we generate the same cipher\ntext from, as you can see,\n\n244\n00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.510\nthe same plaintext message using\ndifferent keys that's a problem.\n\n245\n00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:41.390\nBecause now we essentially have keys\nthat are operating the same way.\n\n246\n00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:44.285\nAnd if we get ahold of one or\nmore of those keys,\n\n247\n00:12:44.285 --> 00:12:46.524\nour chances of decrypting goes up.\n\n248\n00:12:46.524 --> 00:12:51.246\nBecause every key that generates the same\ninformation, is another opportunity for\n\n249\n00:12:51.246 --> 00:12:52.650\nus to unlock the system.\n\n250\n00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:56.299\nIt's like having multiple copies of your\nhouse key and given them to all your\n\n251\n00:12:56.299 --> 00:12:59.505\nfriends, and then wondering who's\ngonna open the door, right.\n\n252\n00:12:59.505 --> 00:13:01.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; When somebody shows up.\n\n253\n00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.879\nYou don't know who it is but\nyou know somebody has a copy of your key.\n\n254\n00:13:03.879 --> 00:13:07.612\nThis becomes a problem because the more\nkey's that are out there that operate\n\n255\n00:13:07.612 --> 00:13:10.542\nthe lock, the more likely it is\nthat somebody loses the key or\n\n256\n00:13:10.542 --> 00:13:11.960\nuses it incorrectly.\n\n257\n00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.840\nThey'll break into your\nhouse when you're not home.\n\n258\n00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.824\n&gt;&gt; Good thing I don't have any friends.\n\n259\n00:13:15.824 --> 00:13:17.490\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; That's not true.\n\n260\n00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:20.100\nYou have Hello Kitty,\nshe's everybody's friend, correct?\n\n261\n00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.680\nAll right, so synchronous and\nasynchronous and by the way,\n\n262\n00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.840\nif anybody wants to be Cherokee 's friend,\nlet us know.\n\n263\n00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.809\nWe'll make sure that we can give you\nan address where you can email her and\n\n264\n00:13:28.809 --> 00:13:29.402\nsay, hello.\n\n265\n00:13:29.402 --> 00:13:31.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Brighten her day, put a smile.\n\n266\n00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:32.280\nSmile for us.\n\n267\n00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.830\nPut a smile on this young lady's face,\nright?\n\n268\n00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:36.335\nThat one right there,\nthere you go look at that.\n\n269\n00:13:36.335 --> 00:13:38.065\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; See, she needs to smile more often.\n\n270\n00:13:38.065 --> 00:13:40.055\nAll right so we're gonna make\nsure we make some friends while\n\n271\n00:13:40.055 --> 00:13:41.002\nwe're talking about this.\n\n272\n00:13:41.002 --> 00:13:41.890\n&gt;&gt; All right, thank you Adam.\n\n273\n00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:44.080\n&gt;&gt; All right, so synchronous and\nasynchronous, let's talk about this.\n\n274\n00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:47.480\nSo you know people sometimes\nwill confuse synchronous and\n\n275\n00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.780\nasynchronous with symmetric and\nasymmetric.\n\n276\n00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.220\nNot that necessary\npeople to still know but\n\n277\n00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:56.330\nthey sometimes is rushed to define things\nand don't think or don't understand, or\n\n278\n00:13:56.330 --> 00:14:01.130\ntry that different terms we'll define\nsymmetric and asymmetric in a minute.\n\n279\n00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:04.530\nPrivate versus public private\nkey pair encryption, but\n\n280\n00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:09.630\nsynchronous versus asynchronous is\nthe idea of how we are setting up and\n\n281\n00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:11.290\ndoing the encryption deencryption.\n\n282\n00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:13.420\nAs you can see, synchronous encrypt or\n\n283\n00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:16.220\ndecrypt immediately in\na stream if you will.\n\n284\n00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:19.980\nAnd this will lead into our block and\nstream algorithm discussions\n\n285\n00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:23.940\nas we continue doing our definitions and\nthrowing out our crypto terms.\n\n286\n00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:28.460\nBut a stream cypher is gonna operate\nsynchronously for the most part.\n\n287\n00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:33.940\nIt's gonna operate on bits of data in\nline linearly one after the other without\n\n288\n00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:38.010\nchunking them, putting them into blocks\nand then operating on an entire block.\n\n289\n00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:43.210\nSo it operates continuously, whereas,\nan asynchronous solution, an asynchronous\n\n290\n00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:49.482\nalgorithm or an asynchronous\nencryption cycle puts stuff into ques.\n\n291\n00:14:49.482 --> 00:14:54.730\nSo when algorithm operates as a block\ncipher It operated asynchronously\n\n292\n00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:59.915\nbecause what we do is we take up a block\nof data let's say 64-bits of data or\n\n293\n00:14:59.915 --> 00:15:04.050\n128-bits or whatever maybe, and\nwe put that into a block and\n\n294\n00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:06.500\nthen we operate on that amount of data,\nbut\n\n295\n00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:10.450\nwe have to fill the container to get that\namount of data before we operate on it.\n\n296\n00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:14.360\nSo we move a box under big,\nif you could imagine this and\n\n297\n00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:18.230\njust close your eyes We drop a certain\namount into the bucket or the box, and\n\n298\n00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:20.190\nthen we move that box off and process it.\n\n299\n00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:22.897\nWe fill the next one, so\nit's like an assembly line.\n\n300\n00:15:22.897 --> 00:15:27.210\nBut there's a delay as we put together\n128 bits in order to operate on.\n\n301\n00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:31.665\nAnd if we don't have 128 bits or whatever\nthe magic number is, we have to then\n\n302\n00:15:31.665 --> 00:15:36.270\npad and add bits to the bucket, so that we\nactually have enough bits to operate on.\n\n303\n00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:39.546\nAnd we'll talk about the concept\nof padding and why it's important.\n\n304\n00:15:39.546 --> 00:15:43.606\nBut the idea is that we're not gonna\noperate in our continuous stream, but\n\n305\n00:15:43.606 --> 00:15:46.964\nrather a predetermined size or\namount of data in every block.\n\n306\n00:15:46.964 --> 00:15:50.178\nAnd so this is where we get the concept\nto stream and block cyphers from.\n\n307\n00:15:50.178 --> 00:15:54.806\nStream ciphers run synchronously,\nalthough they can be modified to run and\n\n308\n00:15:54.806 --> 00:15:55.970\nlook like blocks.\n\n309\n00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:59.020\nAnd we'll talk about that and\nhow that works and vice versa.\n\n310\n00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:02.140\nBlocks can be modified to run like\nstreams, so we can play with them and\n\n311\n00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:04.420\nmanipulate them around back and\nforth in theory.\n\n312\n00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:09.720\nBut synchronous solutions are going to\noperate as stream ciphers traditionally\n\n313\n00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:13.510\nwhereas asynchronous solutions\noperate as box ciphers traditionally.\n\n314\n00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:16.910\nSo we wanna make sure we're comfortable\nwith this and have a sense of this.\n\n315\n00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:19.151\nHash functions,\nvery interesting concept, and\n\n316\n00:16:19.151 --> 00:16:21.241\none that we're gonna\nactually take a look at.\n\n317\n00:16:21.241 --> 00:16:24.357\nLet me do a little show and tell and\ndemo with you here along the way.\n\n318\n00:16:24.357 --> 00:16:25.337\n&gt;&gt; Yay. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Yay,\nwe're gonna do that.\n\n319\n00:16:25.337 --> 00:16:29.906\nBut let's just scroll down here just so\nthat we can see the hash function,\n\n320\n00:16:29.906 --> 00:16:32.630\nkind of put it up at\nthe top of the screen.\n\n321\n00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:34.670\nExpose a few more of our definitions.\n\n322\n00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:37.945\nBefore we talk about hashes, let's\njust talk quickly about symmetric and\n\n323\n00:16:37.945 --> 00:16:40.960\nasymmetric, mention them and\njuxtapose them or\n\n324\n00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.910\ncompare them with synchronous and\nasynchronous.\n\n325\n00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:46.140\nLet's get those out of the way cuz\nthen we can group hash functions and\n\n326\n00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:47.450\ndigital symmetries together.\n\n327\n00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:50.370\nSomebody told me that would be\na good idea before we got started.\n\n328\n00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:52.091\nSo wanna make sure we do those.\n\n329\n00:16:52.091 --> 00:16:53.880\nIt was actually Cherokee's idea\nto talk about it that way.\n\n330\n00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.662\nSo I wanna give her credit for suggesting.\n\n331\n00:16:55.662 --> 00:16:57.600\nIt's actually a really good way\nof presenting that information.\n\n332\n00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.600\nWe're gonna talk about\nit that way in a minute.\n\n333\n00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.222\nBut symmetric and asymmetric,\n\n334\n00:17:01.222 --> 00:17:05.552\nI mentioned that symmetric encryption is\nsingle key encryption or private key only.\n\n335\n00:17:05.552 --> 00:17:08.730\nAnd we define it as single key\nuse to encrypt and decrypt.\n\n336\n00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:11.180\nSo imagine you have that single key for\nthe house, and\n\n337\n00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:15.550\nit's one key that opens not only the front\ndoor, but opens every door in the house.\n\n338\n00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:19.104\nAll the cabinets, anything you have,\nthe garage, whatever it may be.\n\n339\n00:17:19.104 --> 00:17:21.350\nIt's one key that does all of it.\n\n340\n00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:24.000\nAnd don't lose that key cuz,\nboy if you do, that's it,\n\n341\n00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.410\nyou're sleeping outside, right?\n\n342\n00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:29.080\nSo symmetrics single key only\nis how we remember that.\n\n343\n00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.850\nThe single key being the private key.\n\n344\n00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:34.320\nRemember Kershaw's Principle,\nkeep the key secret, right?\n\n345\n00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.340\nDon't expose the private key.\n\n346\n00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:38.014\nTell the bad actor everything else, right?\n\n347\n00:17:38.014 --> 00:17:41.300\nGive them the algorithm,\ngive them the cipher text.\n\n348\n00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.750\nEven tell them all the other\nsupporting elements, but\n\n349\n00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:45.190\ndo not expose the private key.\n\n350\n00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:46.120\nIf we don't do that,\n\n351\n00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:51.300\nif we keep the private key secure, chances\nare good the system will remain secure.\n\n352\n00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.100\nIt's easy for me.\n\n353\n00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:53.770\nI don't have to keep\ntrack of several keys.\n\n354\n00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:58.570\nBut it's also easy for an attacker if they\nwere able just to obtain that one key.\n\n355\n00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:01.600\n&gt;&gt; From an attack perspective, right, they\njust have to zero in on one single key.\n\n356\n00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.000\nSo that does make it easier for them.\n\n357\n00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.010\nSo we have to obviously make the key\nnot only incredibly hard to get,\n\n358\n00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:10.050\nbut we have to make it\nincredibly hard to guess.\n\n359\n00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:14.140\nBecause if we keep the key secure and\nthe bad actor has to do what we call brute\n\n360\n00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:18.060\nforce it, guessing, just iterating\nthrough every permutation or\n\n361\n00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:21.690\ncombination of the key, and\nthey have to try every one to guess.\n\n362\n00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:24.760\nIf we make the key very long and\nwe make it very difficult for\n\n363\n00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:28.820\nthem to guess as a result, it's less\nlikely that they will guess the key.\n\n364\n00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:31.210\nWe're obviously discounting the fact\nthey could steal it from us.\n\n365\n00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:32.670\nWe'll secure it, we'll safeguard it,\n\n366\n00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:35.360\nwe'll store it in such a way that\nthey don't know where to find it.\n\n367\n00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:40.250\nAsymmetric encryption is using two\ndifferent but mathematically related keys.\n\n368\n00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:42.810\nWe call this a public private key pair.\n\n369\n00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:46.600\nSo think about the fact\nthat symmetric single key,\n\n370\n00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:50.890\nasymmetric public private key\nis two kinds of keys, right.\n\n371\n00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:54.850\nI think of asymmetric as all keys,\npublic, private, all keys, at least for\n\n372\n00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:56.290\nme that's what works.\n\n373\n00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:59.470\nSymmetric, I think of a single key,\nprivate key only.\n\n374\n00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:02.600\nYou may come up with an equally good or\nbetter way to remember that.\n\n375\n00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:05.228\nI'm not saying you have to do it my way,\nI'm just pointing out,\n\n376\n00:19:05.228 --> 00:19:07.042\ncome up with some sort\nof way to in your mind.\n\n377\n00:19:07.042 --> 00:19:09.108\nRemember the difference between the two?\n\n378\n00:19:09.108 --> 00:19:11.440\nYou wanna be able to define these terms.\n\n379\n00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:15.520\nYou wanna be able to use them and\napply the knowledge if asked on an exam.\n\n380\n00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.460\nBut also in the real world,\nwhen you talk to peers and colleagues,\n\n381\n00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:22.120\nand people that do this and are\ninteracting around these technologies in\n\n382\n00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:26.010\nthe workplace, you have to make sure\nyou speak about the right solution.\n\n383\n00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:30.490\nIf you're doing symmetric encryption and\nyou refer to it as asymmetric encryption,\n\n384\n00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:32.610\nthey're gonna have a very different\nidea of what you're doing.\n\n385\n00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:35.480\nAnd the algorithms used\nare different as we'll find out.\n\n386\n00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:38.240\nAnd as a result they operate differently.\n\n387\n00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.470\nAnd they're used for different things.\n\n388\n00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:41.820\nSo it's very important to refer\nto them the right way, right?\n\n389\n00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.600\n&gt;&gt; I always think of symmetrics same,\nthat's my [INAUDIBLE], yeah.\n\n390\n00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:45.390\n&gt;&gt; Same or symbol,\n\n391\n00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:49.760\nall kind of in theory refers to the,\nI'm not gonna say same again.\n\n392\n00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.855\nRefers to the-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n393\n00:19:51.855 --> 00:19:52.894\n&gt;&gt; Specific idea that we were\n\n394\n00:19:52.894 --> 00:19:53.830\ntalking about.\n\n395\n00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:56.790\nCan you give me, I know you have\nsome examples you'd written down but\n\n396\n00:19:56.790 --> 00:20:00.090\ncan you give us just an example of\na symmetric algorithm real quick?\n\n397\n00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:02.170\n&gt;&gt; DES, triple DES.\n\n398\n00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:03.483\n&gt;&gt; DES.\n&gt;&gt; Blowfish, [CROSSTALK]\n\n399\n00:20:03.483 --> 00:20:04.460\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so any of those, right.\n\n400\n00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:07.360\nSo DES stands for\ndata encryption standard.\n\n401\n00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.980\nWe often we use algorithms\nthat are not spelled out,\n\n402\n00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.520\nwe just tend to use the abbreviations,\nor their names.\n\n403\n00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.630\nYou've heard me mention AES,\nthe advanced encryption standard.\n\n404\n00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:17.710\nSo DES is certainly an example.\n\n405\n00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:20.250\nBlowfish, another example,\nso there's a few there.\n\n406\n00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:21.060\nWhat about asymmetric?\n\n407\n00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.550\nYou got some on your list for\nthat as well?\n\n408\n00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:23.490\n&gt;&gt; I do, you know it.\n\n409\n00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:27.640\nWhat about RCA or ECC,\nelliptical curve cryptography?\n\n410\n00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:31.450\n&gt;&gt; All right, so, ECC is elliptical\ncurve cryptography, is a great one.\n\n411\n00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:33.350\n&gt;&gt; It's actually used\nin mobile devices and\n\n412\n00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:36.392\nsmartphones and\ntablets all over the place today.\n\n413\n00:20:36.392 --> 00:20:39.360\nWe'll talk more about how it's\nimplemented when we get into asymmetric.\n\n414\n00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:43.780\nBut it's actually a really neat concept,\nbecause it uses a three dimensional xy\n\n415\n00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:49.360\ngrid to essentially map out an elliptic\ncurve in space, and then plot random\n\n416\n00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:53.580\npoints on the curve to generate the keys,\nand then use those to drive encryption.\n\n417\n00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:58.160\nBut because it's such a easy thing\nto do in the math code processors of\n\n418\n00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.550\nmodern day computers, to do this kind of\nrendering because that's really what some\n\n419\n00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:07.530\nof the basic concepts that the CPU math\ncode processors are designed to do in real\n\n420\n00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:11.400\ntime that we can implement them with\nas little as about 5K of memory today.\n\n421\n00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.990\nSo it's very good for\n\n422\n00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:16.510\nimplementation in mobile platforms\nwhere we don't have a lot of resources.\n\n423\n00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:17.820\nSo it's actually used all the time.\n\n424\n00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:21.510\nYou guys, all of us, use it hundreds of\ntimes a day whenever you use your cell\n\n425\n00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:26.180\nphone, your tablet, any type of device\nthat does encryption on the fly.\n\n426\n00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:28.360\nIt's probably implementing ECC to do that.\n\n427\n00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.520\nSo it's actually a neat little algorithm.\n\n428\n00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:31.561\nThat's a good example of one.\n\n429\n00:21:31.561 --> 00:21:33.140\nAll right, very good, so we have that.\n\n430\n00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:36.980\nLet's go and let's talk or let's circle\nback to talking about hash functions.\n\n431\n00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:40.010\nSo a hash function is\nreally pretty interesting.\n\n432\n00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:42.960\nIt's a one way mathematical operation.\n\n433\n00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.780\nAnd when I say this to people they're\nlike, all right, so that means that we\n\n434\n00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:50.470\ncan't go the other way so there's no way\nto take a hash and do anything with it.\n\n435\n00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:51.030\nWell, not at all.\n\n436\n00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:53.390\nThere's actually a lot of\nthings we can do with it.\n\n437\n00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:57.350\nIt is an integrity mechanism,\nwhat we would call an integrity check.\n\n438\n00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:00.550\nThere are other names that can be used for\nthe hash function.\n\n439\n00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:01.631\nAs Cherokee knows,\n\n440\n00:22:01.631 --> 00:22:05.841\nwe went through a whole list of alternate\nnaming thought processes for these.\n\n441\n00:22:05.841 --> 00:22:08.526\nSo message digests, digital signatures,\n\n442\n00:22:08.526 --> 00:22:12.454\nintegrity verification or\nintegrity validation mechanisms.\n\n443\n00:22:12.454 --> 00:22:16.450\nHMAC is another one, right, the hashing.\n\n444\n00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:18.709\n&gt;&gt; NIC.\n&gt;&gt; Message authentication control, sorry,\n\n445\n00:22:18.709 --> 00:22:21.000\nI had to actually swallow\nbefore I said that.\n\n446\n00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So any message authentication control,\n\n447\n00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.540\na MAC, an HMAC,\n\n448\n00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:28.940\nthere's about ten different names on\nthe list out there floating around.\n\n449\n00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:33.990\nIf you play Geek Trivia, and hacking\ncomes up as the topic of conversation,\n\n450\n00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:36.830\nthen you could throw out and\nyou would win with.\n\n451\n00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:41.120\nBut generically we're gonna just\nessentially stick with hashing right now.\n\n452\n00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.760\nJust as the function,\nwe're gonna call it a hash function.\n\n453\n00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:44.560\nWe'll get into and\n\n454\n00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:48.350\ndifferentiate what that means with digital\nsignatures separately in just a minute.\n\n455\n00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:53.490\nBut generically a hash function takes\nwhatever the inputted message or\n\n456\n00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:54.150\ndata may be.\n\n457\n00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:55.710\nWe can hash a file.\n\n458\n00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:57.670\nWe can hash a text stream.\n\n459\n00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:00.420\nWe can hash an individual bit.\n\n460\n00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:05.490\nWe can hash all of the known combined\nwritten knowledge of humanity for\n\n461\n00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:09.200\nthe last 10,000 years,\nanything in between, right?\n\n462\n00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:13.380\nAnd we can take that,\nrun it through a hashing algorithm, and\n\n463\n00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:16.270\nwe are not encrypting, and\npeople often misunderstand,\n\n464\n00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:18.710\nmisrepresent and confuse this concept.\n\n465\n00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:21.280\nHashing is not a confidentiality control.\n\n466\n00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.630\nIt is not an encryption mechanism.\n\n467\n00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:26.769\nIt does not provide confidentiality,\nin other words.\n\n468\n00:23:26.769 --> 00:23:28.340\nIt is an integrity mechanism.\n\n469\n00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:31.500\nAn equally important protection\nthought process, but\n\n470\n00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:35.430\nit's about validation of\ninformation accuracy.\n\n471\n00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:38.120\nIt's changed management,\nI often tell my customers and\n\n472\n00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:41.700\nstudents, integrity is\nchanged management for data.\n\n473\n00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:42.611\nData has not been changed.\n\n474\n00:23:42.611 --> 00:23:46.967\nWe define a change as an add or\nremove or modify event, right?\n\n475\n00:23:46.967 --> 00:23:47.549\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n476\n00:23:47.549 --> 00:23:49.871\ndata has not been changed in any way.\n\n477\n00:23:49.871 --> 00:23:53.711\nSince we took the data,\nput it under integrity control,\n\n478\n00:23:53.711 --> 00:23:58.410\nwe can look backwards to that point\nin time from where we are now.\n\n479\n00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:00.790\nAnd if the comparison that we run,\n\n480\n00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:05.470\nwhich is the hash, shows up the same\nfrom that time period to now.\n\n481\n00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:09.000\nThe data has integrity, we say,\nthe data has not been modified.\n\n482\n00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.100\nIf even the slightest change occurs, and\n\n483\n00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:12.890\nI'm gonna show you this\nin real time in a minute.\n\n484\n00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:15.430\nIf even the slightest change occurs,\n\n485\n00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:18.570\nthen we know that the hash\nwill not be the same.\n\n486\n00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:21.440\nAnd if the hash is not the same\nwe do not have integrity.\n\n487\n00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.020\nWe don't know who changed it.\n\n488\n00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:25.390\nWe don't know what was\nchanged necessarily.\n\n489\n00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:28.630\nBut we do know that there has been\na modification, an add or remove,\n\n490\n00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:31.560\nand we know the data no\nlonger has integrity.\n\n491\n00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:36.684\nSo a hash function allows us to understand\nhow to fix data at a moment in time.\n\n492\n00:24:36.684 --> 00:24:40.573\nAnd then throughout the history\nof that data, both backwards and\n\n493\n00:24:40.573 --> 00:24:43.530\nforwards to the present moment.\n\n494\n00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:48.350\nCompare that data to the known point in\ntime that we put the data under hash or\n\n495\n00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:49.530\nintegrity control.\n\n496\n00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:52.200\nThis is used with forensic\nexamination of evidence.\n\n497\n00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.930\nThis is used to validate\nthe chain of custody of evidence.\n\n498\n00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:57.832\nCherokee knows all about that cuz\nwe talked about that extensively.\n\n499\n00:24:57.832 --> 00:25:00.390\nIn our EC-Council incident\nhandling shows that we've done.\n\n500\n00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:03.585\nEncourage you to take a look\nat that along with CHFI for\n\n501\n00:25:03.585 --> 00:25:08.271\nEC-Council if you're interested in some\nof the stuff we're talking about in\n\n502\n00:25:08.271 --> 00:25:12.965\nthe lateral relationships to the broader\nworld of IT security and forensics.\n\n503\n00:25:12.965 --> 00:25:16.460\nDone whole shows on those topics and\nit's really fascinating stuff.\n\n504\n00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:18.120\nSo definitely want to look at that.\n\n505\n00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:22.780\nBut generically hashing is the idea of\ncreating an integrity validation marker at\n\n506\n00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:24.480\na certain point in time on the data.\n\n507\n00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.790\nNow we have a little formula that\nI've created and come up with there.\n\n508\n00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:30.470\nAnd we'll just use it to\nrepresent the way a hash works.\n\n509\n00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:33.310\nThis is not to say you\nhave to know this formula.\n\n510\n00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:35.545\nYou will most likely never\nsee this formula on an exam,\n\n511\n00:25:35.545 --> 00:25:37.060\ncuz it came out of here.\n\n512\n00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:40.230\nAnd I don't write the exam questions so\nit's not coming our of here and\n\n513\n00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:42.080\ngoing on the paper for you to answer.\n\n514\n00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:43.040\nBut it is a good way for\n\n515\n00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:47.270\nyou to distill down the information\nrequired to understand how hashing works.\n\n516\n00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:48.810\nSo let's quickly take a look.\n\n517\n00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:51.500\nVariable data input of\nany size as I mentioned.\n\n518\n00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:55.280\nAnything from a single bit of data,\nthe letter a is a single bit of data.\n\n519\n00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:59.360\nAll the way up to everything in the known\nwritten history of the world, right?\n\n520\n00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:00.802\nYou ever seen the movie\nHistory of the World?\n\n521\n00:26:00.802 --> 00:26:01.971\n&gt;&gt;

Cool.\n&gt;&gt; So let me just switch over here,\n\n557\n00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:44.323\ngive me half a second.\n\n558\n00:27:44.323 --> 00:27:47.104\nLet me just get rid of this real quick,\ncuz we don't need this.\n\n559\n00:27:47.104 --> 00:27:52.649\nAnd then let me go over here.\n\n560\n00:27:52.649 --> 00:27:54.540\nLet's just bring this up real quick.\n\n561\n00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:58.810\nAnd I'm just gonna move this over, just so\nwe get it on the side of the screen here.\n\n562\n00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:02.590\nAnd we can see it a little bit better,\nthere we go, away from the window.\n\n563\n00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:06.580\nSo this is a free piece of software\nyou can download called HashCalc.\n\n564\n00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:09.320\nHashCalc's just a calculator,\nliterally it's a hash calculator.\n\n565\n00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.430\nYou go out on Google,\n\n566\n00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:13.870\ngoogle HashCalc, SlavaSoft is\nthe name of the company that does it.\n\n567\n00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:15.430\nYou will find a download link for it.\n\n568\n00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:18.030\nIt's free, we love free,\nfree is always fun.\n\n569\n00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:22.190\nSo we have this and there's many other\nforms of this kind of a software product.\n\n570\n00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:24.420\nWe're just gonna use this particular one.\n\n571\n00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:29.090\nAnd what I'm gonna do,\nI mentioned that I could hash a file,\n\n572\n00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:31.100\nI can hash a text string, a hex string.\n\n573\n00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:33.940\nWe're gonna do a text string,\njust to keep it simple, okay?\n\n574\n00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:38.510\nAnd so, the string that we're gonna hash\nis the following, I have it right here.\n\n575\n00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:44.330\nIt's gonna be the dog is green, you can\nsee it right there, let me just copy that.\n\n576\n00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:49.570\nAnd I'm going to run it through\nthe hashing calculator.\n\n577\n00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:53.090\nSo I'm just going to paste it there,\nthe dog is green, period.\n\n578\n00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:56.810\nAnd then I've already pre-selected\ncertain hashing algorithms.\n\n579\n00:28:56.810 --> 00:29:01.040\nYou'll see I have check marks here next\nto MD5, SHA-1, the two we talked about.\n\n580\n00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:05.010\nThere are others,\nthere's RIPEMD160, there's CRC,\n\n581\n00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:08.500\ncyclical redundancy check,\n32, etc., right?\n\n582\n00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.920\nSo we can take a look at that,\nsee what those are.\n\n583\n00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:12.470\nSo we're gonna choose a few.\n\n584\n00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:14.920\nBut we're only gonna really\nworry about MD5 and SHA-1.\n\n585\n00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.780\nThe others are there really just for show.\n\n586\n00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:19.600\nBecause otherwise, they get jealous,\nif they don't get any air time.\n\n587\n00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.326\nMD5 and SHA-1 steal the show.\n\n588\n00:29:21.326 --> 00:29:24.057\nSo we're gonna use them, so\nlet's go ahead, let's calculate this,\n\n589\n00:29:24.057 --> 00:29:26.480\nI'm just gonna hit Calculate,\nit's real simple.\n\n590\n00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.930\nAnd what hashing does,\n\n591\n00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:32.910\nis it generates a bit stream output\nof a certain fixed bit length.\n\n592\n00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:35.130\nThis is where those\nnumbers become important.\n\n593\n00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:38.360\nMD5 always generates 128 bit output.\n\n594\n00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:41.673\nWe're gonna see what the bits are,\nin just a minute I'll copy them and\n\n595\n00:29:41.673 --> 00:29:43.542\npaste them into the NotePad document.\n\n596\n00:29:43.542 --> 00:29:48.730\nSHA-1, really SHA-160\nputs out 160 bit output.\n\n597\n00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:52.190\nYou could see SHA-256,\nSHA-384, SHA-512 there.\n\n598\n00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:55.520\n&gt;&gt; Let me guess, 256.\n\n599\n00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:56.690\n&gt;&gt; Ding ding, right?\n\n600\n00:29:56.690 --> 00:30:01.027\nSo you get 256 bits,\n384, 512 respectively.\n\n601\n00:30:01.027 --> 00:30:06.640\nRIPEMD160 puts out 160 bits,\nso you get 160 bit output.\n\n602\n00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:09.180\nBut it's not just the bit stream output,\nbut\n\n603\n00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:13.520\nit is the order of the bits,\nthe 0s, 1s, the as through zs, and\n\n604\n00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:18.620\nthe order of them as well as the amount of\nthem, that equal the actual hash value.\n\n605\n00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:22.560\nOr the message digest, or the digital\nsignature or whatever we're doing.\n\n606\n00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:26.214\nSo we're gonna take the MD5 value,\ngonna copy that.\n\n607\n00:30:26.214 --> 00:30:28.180\nLet me grab that real quick.\n\n608\n00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:33.820\nAnd we're going to go ahead go over here\nand I'm gonna just hit space a few times.\n\n609\n00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:38.600\nI'm gonna paste that in so\nthat you can see that is the MD5 128 bit.\n\n610\n00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:44.077\nLet's just put 128 bits there.\n\n611\n00:30:44.077 --> 00:30:48.434\nOutput stream, or the hash value for\nthe sentence the dog is green,\n\n612\n00:30:48.434 --> 00:30:51.300\nwith the period at the end right there.\n\n613\n00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:55.304\nLet's go grab our SHA-1 output.\n\n614\n00:30:57.192 --> 00:31:00.250\nBoom, let's take that,\nlet's just minimize that.\n\n615\n00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:02.030\nWe'll put that here as well.\n\n616\n00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:05.070\nWhoops, hold on one second.\n\n617\n00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:07.990\nThat was the function key\ninstead of the control key.\n\n618\n00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:11.063\nAnd you can see it is longer, right?\n\n619\n00:31:11.063 --> 00:31:13.870\nSo it's 160 bits, we'll just put that\nthere to remind ourselves of that.\n\n620\n00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:14.390\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n621\n00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:19.630\n&gt;&gt; And so now, we have a frozen integrity\nmoment in time or integrity check or\n\n622\n00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:24.940\nhash value attributed to the sentence the\ndog is green with a period right there.\n\n623\n00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:27.742\nNow if we leave that alone and\nwe come back in an hour,\n\n624\n00:31:27.742 --> 00:31:31.882\nyou guys go take a break right, get\nsome coffee, mow the lawn, walk the dog,\n\n625\n00:31:31.882 --> 00:31:34.207\nfeed the dog, whatever it may be, right?\n\n626\n00:31:34.207 --> 00:31:36.645\nCome back in an hour, we're not taking\na break by the way, don't do that,\n\n627\n00:31:36.645 --> 00:31:37.314\nI'm only kidding.\n\n628\n00:31:37.314 --> 00:31:42.144\nBut if you left and came back, right, and\nwe went ahead and fast forwarded in time,\n\n629\n00:31:42.144 --> 00:31:45.111\nas we're about to do through\nthe magic of ITProTV,\n\n630\n00:31:45.111 --> 00:31:47.818\nDo we have like a time\nwarp kinda video visual?\n\n631\n00:31:47.818 --> 00:31:50.004\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, I don't have\nany kind of sound effect of that.\n\n632\n00:31:50.004 --> 00:31:51.018\n&gt;&gt; Or something like that?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n633\n00:31:51.018 --> 00:31:51.563\n&gt;&gt; Or like the,\n\n634\n00:31:51.563 --> 00:31:52.063\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n\n635\n00:31:52.063 --> 00:31:53.890\n&gt;&gt; The psychedelic kinda, there we go.\n\n636\n00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:57.715\nSo look, it's an hour ahead, awesome, it's\nlike Daylight Savings Time all over again.\n\n637\n00:31:57.715 --> 00:32:01.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So if we try this now, and we run\n\n638\n00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:07.170\nthe dog is Green., through the hashing\nalgorithm again, we should get the exact\n\n639\n00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:11.100\nsame output if it has not changed\n&gt;&gt; But as you probably have surmised\n\n640\n00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:16.090\nfrom my demo, if we change it in any way,\nI said even the smallest change.\n\n641\n00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:18.450\n&gt;&gt; I see that small change\n&gt;&gt; You do see that small change,\n\n642\n00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:20.820\nwe're missing something\nat the end of that line.\n\n643\n00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:25.010\nSo it's not just the actual bits\nthemselves in the sense of the letters,\n\n644\n00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:27.380\nbut it's the punctuation or\nanything associated with it.\n\n645\n00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:29.810\n&gt;&gt; I could change by removing a period.\n\n646\n00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:31.180\nI could add or remove a space,\n\n647\n00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:34.070\nyou asked me about the value\nof spaces in a prior episode.\n\n648\n00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:36.520\nAdding a space would\nmodify the hash string.\n\n649\n00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:41.400\nI could change the capitalisation,\nfrom uppercase G to lowercase g.\n\n650\n00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:46.550\nChange is change, add remove modify,\nwe don't joke around here at ITProTV,\n\n651\n00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:49.150\nwe're serious about our change,\nas we're about to show you.\n\n652\n00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:53.200\nIf I modify this data in any way and\nI'm running back through.\n\n653\n00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:56.430\nWe're gonna see that we actually\ndo get different output.\n\n654\n00:32:56.430 --> 00:33:00.570\nSo lets take a look at this right now-\n&gt;&gt; Now Adam we had a question in chat\n\n655\n00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:05.210\nabout using a particular hash\nvalue in forensic cases.\n\n656\n00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:06.990\nAnd you are actually\ndemonstrating that right now.\n\n657\n00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:11.800\nIf I were trying to modify\nevidence then if I already have\n\n658\n00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:16.310\na hash value then I would be comparing\nit to prove that authenticity or for\n\n659\n00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:17.870\nthat integrity, like you had mentioned.\n\n660\n00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:18.610\nCorrect?\n\n661\n00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:19.730\n&gt;&gt; So, yes.\n\n662\n00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:24.140\nIf we are gonna validate the integrity,\nthe authenticity, as you said.\n\n663\n00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:27.730\nThe chain of custody is what we would\ngenerically refer to it as, for\n\n664\n00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:29.190\nregards to forensics.\n\n665\n00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:31.030\nBut any or\nall of those terms are accurate.\n\n666\n00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:34.680\nIt's just that the broader conversation\ntakes place within the chain of custody\n\n667\n00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:35.940\nthought process.\n\n668\n00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:38.510\nOf evidence, and\nthe understanding of who's been\n\n669\n00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:41.390\nable to access that evidence under\nwhat conditions, to what end.\n\n670\n00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:44.410\nFor what reasons,\nwhile it's been under management,\n\n671\n00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:47.220\non its way towards potentially\nbeing evidence in a case, right?\n\n672\n00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:51.150\nSo when we think about chain of custody,\nauthenticity, all of that,\n\n673\n00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:53.940\nwe would take a hash value\nof whatever the evidence is.\n\n674\n00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:57.180\nThe hard drive, or whatever it may be,\nthe digital evidence.\n\n675\n00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:01.650\nWe would hash it at the point of\ncollection, and prior to examination.\n\n676\n00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:03.050\nSo we would collect it in the field.\n\n677\n00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:07.650\nWe would take it into the forensics\nclean room area that we work in.\n\n678\n00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:11.690\nWe would create a hash of that\nevidence at that moment in time.\n\n679\n00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:13.830\nThat hash represents the integrity,\n\n680\n00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:16.710\nthe validity of the evidence\nat the moment it was gathered.\n\n681\n00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:20.650\nAt that point, we can then examine the\nevidence using an alternate copy that was\n\n682\n00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:23.095\ndone with forensically sound mechanisms.\n\n683\n00:34:23.095 --> 00:34:24.950\nWrite-blockers are used.\n\n684\n00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:28.590\nWe make copies of the digital evidence in\na way that doesn't modify the original.\n\n685\n00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:31.590\nWe work off the copy, so\nthe original's always frozen and\n\n686\n00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:33.880\nstored securely for reference.\n\n687\n00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.580\nWe can hash at any point going forward.\n\n688\n00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:38.260\nAnd look at the comparison.\n\n689\n00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:41.850\nIf there's been any modification\ndue to our examination or whatever,\n\n690\n00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:45.590\nthat will show up because of as we're\nabout to see, the hash value will change.\n\n691\n00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:49.200\nSo it is used in forensic examination\nabsolutely, that exact way.\n\n692\n00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:49.810\nAll right, so\n\n693\n00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:54.020\nI've already run the dog is green\nwith no period through the hash calc.\n\n694\n00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:56.100\nAnd we now have our new hashes.\n\n695\n00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:58.300\nNow I know it's kind of hard to see so\nwe're gonna copy them and\n\n696\n00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:01.020\nput them back on the notepad,\njust to compare them.\n\n697\n00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:05.120\nBut I can tell you without even having\nto look that they have modified.\n\n698\n00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:06.730\nSo MD5 down here.\n\n699\n00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:12.270\nWe can see when we run the comparison\nbetween the one on the top.\n\n700\n00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:16.140\n&gt;&gt; Totally.\n&gt;&gt; 3f2bcc, cbe, or c9b, whatever.\n\n701\n00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:17.840\nYou can see it's changed right, and so\n\n702\n00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:23.470\nwe know that although it still is 128\nbits that it has indeed modified.\n\n703\n00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:29.250\nAnd if we look at the 160 the SHY1 we'll\nsee that stream has changed as well,\n\n704\n00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:32.020\nwe just copy that over so\nwe can take a look at that one.\n\n705\n00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:39.230\nAnd we will see that both\nindeed have modified.\n\n706\n00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:43.500\nAnd as a result we can tell\nthat there has been a change.\n\n707\n00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:45.870\nNow, we can clearly see the change, right?\n\n708\n00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:46.830\nWhere's Waldo, right?\n\n709\n00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:48.570\nWhat's different,\nwe can see the periods gone.\n\n710\n00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:51.560\nBut, if we didn't know that there\nwas a period there to begin with,\n\n711\n00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:56.490\nand our vision of the evidence was the dog\nis Green, no period, how would we know?\n\n712\n00:35:56.490 --> 00:36:00.170\nWe have no, necessarily, understanding\nof what may have gone on in the past.\n\n713\n00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:03.600\nAll we can do is compare\nwhat we now know to a hash\n\n714\n00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:05.830\nrepresenting the data from the past.\n\n715\n00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:10.330\nWe may in other words, not actually\nsee the dog as green period and\n\n716\n00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:11.260\nknow that's what we have.\n\n717\n00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:14.480\nCuz then we could compare the two and\nthen, of course it's changed.\n\n718\n00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:18.820\nBut if we don't know this,\nif in other words, all were given, right?\n\n719\n00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:24.740\nIs this, we're not told what\nthe original evidence is.\n\n720\n00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:27.740\nWe're just given a hash that\nrepresents the evidence.\n\n721\n00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:29.160\n&gt;&gt; Is it the same or not?\n\n722\n00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:32.230\n&gt;&gt; Just very simple,\nis this what we were given?\n\n723\n00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:35.920\nWell apparently no because the hash value,\nthe hash string is different.\n\n724\n00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:38.170\nSo many times we may not see the original,\n\n725\n00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:40.910\nwe will simply see the hash\nrepresenting the original.\n\n726\n00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:43.670\n&gt;&gt; That makes sense if you're looking at,\nfor instance, a hard drive and\n\n727\n00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:47.580\nyou're not able to examine every single\nbit of information within that hard drive.\n\n728\n00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:49.390\nYou're just looking for that hash value.\n\n729\n00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:51.220\n&gt;&gt; To represent all the bits\neven though we don't\n\n730\n00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:52.535\nnecessarily examine each one, as you-\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n731\n00:36:52.535 --> 00:36:55.510\n&gt;&gt; Said, so\nthat's one of the main reasons we do this.\n\n732\n00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:59.870\nAnd as I said, this can be done at any\nmoment in time and it immediately tells us\n\n733\n00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:03.600\nwhether we've had a change or not, and\nif we have, obviously we can tell that.\n\n734\n00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:07.640\nIf we haven't, we are happy because\nwe can know hey, it has not been.\n\n735\n00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.730\nNow, could somebody spoof the hash?\n\n736\n00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:13.240\nIf they're given the hash could they\nsay look, that was the hash I got.\n\n737\n00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:16.090\nWell yeah but all we have to do is run the\ncomparison to see whether it's legitimate\n\n738\n00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:20.510\nor not, so you'll remember we're\nnot representing the data with\n\n739\n00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:21.440\nconfidentiality.\n\n740\n00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:24.510\nWe're not encrypting it, trying to hide\ngood data from bad actors here, and\n\n741\n00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:26.070\nkeep it secret, right?\n\n742\n00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:28.350\nWe are taking known data and\n\n743\n00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:32.930\nvalidating the integrity,\nthe proof of origin, the authenticity.\n\n744\n00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:34.680\nThings like that with hashing.\n\n745\n00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:35.970\nIt's very different and\n\n746\n00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:40.160\nyou have to understand the very\nsignificant difference in approach and\n\n747\n00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:43.680\nthe difference in what we offer from\na protection standpoint in the outcome.\n\n748\n00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.350\nAs a result of that as\nwe compare these two.\n\n749\n00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:47.620\n&gt;&gt; Adam, I've got some bad news.\n\n750\n00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:50.600\nIt looks like we're out of time and we're\nonly a quarter way down our list here.\n\n751\n00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:52.020\nSo it looks like-\n&gt;&gt; That's not bad news,\n\n752\n00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:55.020\nit just means we're going to have\nlike part 12, that's all that means.\n\n753\n00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:56.664\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's all, that's all.\n\n754\n00:37:56.664 --> 00:37:59.949\nSo ladies and gentlemen, stay tuned\nbecause we're gearing up here for\n\n755\n00:37:59.949 --> 00:38:01.195\nour series of definitions.\n\n756\n00:38:01.195 --> 00:38:03.970\nSo we'll go ahead and sign off for\nthis particular episode.\n\n757\n00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:06.850\nRemember, I'm Cherokee\nBoose I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n758\n00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:10.799\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:11.564\n&gt;&gt; You are watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.564 --> 00:00:16.303\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your E\\CES Series,\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:16.303 --> 00:00:20.293\nIf you've been following along you'll know\nthis is actually part two where else in\n\n6\n00:00:20.293 --> 00:00:21.980\nthe previous episode.\n\n7\n00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.780\nAdam gave us an entire list\nof definitions to study and\n\n8\n00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.670\na little bit of movie homework as well.\n\n9\n00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.250\nBut we're going to pick right back up and\n\n10\n00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.230\ncontinue on with those cryptography\ndefinitions in this show.\n\n11\n00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.650\nSo thank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n12\n00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.685\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome, Captain Cryptography.\n\n13\n00:00:35.685 --> 00:00:36.475\nCryptography, signing on.\n\n14\n00:00:36.475 --> 00:00:39.243\nAll right, so,\nwe're gonna keep going where we left off.\n\n15\n00:00:39.243 --> 00:00:40.964\nCorrect me if I'm wrong,\n\n16\n00:00:40.964 --> 00:00:45.285\nwe had left off talking through\nhashing in our prior episode.\n\n17\n00:00:45.285 --> 00:00:47.865\nMentioned digital signatures,\nhadn't really talked about them.\n\n18\n00:00:47.865 --> 00:00:50.555\nWe need to kinda group them together and\nfigure that out.\n\n19\n00:00:50.555 --> 00:00:53.225\nSo we're gonna go back,\ntake a look at our list if we could, and\n\n20\n00:00:53.225 --> 00:00:56.805\nwe're gonna come back up where digital\nsignatures are, or at least see them.\n\n21\n00:00:56.805 --> 00:01:00.410\nIf we could see the screen, or rather my\nmachine, I should say, sorry about that.\n\n22\n00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.840\nAnd you will see that we left off\nright there with digital signatures.\n\n23\n00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.760\nNow, if you haven't\nseen the prior episode,\n\n24\n00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.350\nas Cherokee was saying, then me referring\nback to the discussion on hashing, and\n\n25\n00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.580\nreminding you of what we already saw\nmay not make a lot of sense to you.\n\n26\n00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.840\nAnd I'm not gonna redo the whole\ndiscussion of the demo again.\n\n27\n00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.070\nSo please make sure you've\nseen that before we continue.\n\n28\n00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.790\nIf you haven't,\nput us on hold here for a minute.\n\n29\n00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.020\nGo back take a look.\n\n30\n00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.620\nCome on back when you're ready\nwe'll be here patiently waiting and\n\n31\n00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:27.440\nwe'll be ready to go.\n\n32\n00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.930\nIf you have then obviously were gonna\ncontinue with our conversation.\n\n33\n00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.390\nSo we've picked up with the idea\nof hashing, creating that\n\n34\n00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.930\nintegrity check that validation\nthat data has not been modified.\n\n35\n00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.860\nWe use various algorithms, MD5, SHA1,\nRIPEMD160, CRC32, whatever it may be.\n\n36\n00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.039\nAnd we produce the hash value,\nthe bitstream output in a fixed bitstream\n\n37\n00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.095\namount, 128-bits,\n160-bits in the case of MD5 and SHA1.\n\n38\n00:01:53.095 --> 00:01:57.544\nAnd we use that to represent\nthe integrity of the data at that moment\n\n39\n00:01:57.544 --> 00:02:01.410\nin time that we do the capture or\nthe comparison.\n\n40\n00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.770\nDigital signatures takes that idea and\nattaches the full process of integrity.\n\n41\n00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:14.140\nFull process of hashing to the sending and\nreceiving of emails specifically.\n\n42\n00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.270\nAnd the hash value becomes known\nas the message digest as an MD.\n\n43\n00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.960\nMessage digest MD5,\nmessage digest algorithm.\n\n44\n00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.140\nSo, the idea with digitally signing\nan email is that we are hashing\n\n45\n00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.460\nthe email to prove the integrity of\nthe data, of the body of the email itself,\n\n46\n00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.320\nbut also to provide, and I mentioned these\nterms when we talked about hashing in\n\n47\n00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.590\nthe last episode of the non-repudiation\nand proof of origin of the data.\n\n48\n00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.980\nProof of origin implies that\nI actually sent the data and\n\n49\n00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.870\nthat you can prove that it was me.\n\n50\n00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.330\nAnd that non repudiation\nimplies that you can't deny\n\n51\n00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.180\nhaving done something right, essentially\nno I wasn't there I didn't do it.\n\n52\n00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.360\nWell we have evidence that you did because\nwe used a unique identifier of yours\n\n53\n00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.460\nthat in theory should only be known to\nyou in order to carry out this activity.\n\n54\n00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.551\nSo, either someone is impersonating you,\nright?\n\n55\n00:03:14.551 --> 00:03:19.218\nThey're masquerading or spoofing,\nterms we hear in security with regards to\n\n56\n00:03:19.218 --> 00:03:24.027\nsomebody altering the Information in the\nsystem under the guise of an authorized\n\n57\n00:03:24.027 --> 00:03:28.483\nuser when in fact they're not,\nthey are illegitimately impersonating or\n\n58\n00:03:28.483 --> 00:03:32.390\ntaking somebody's identify and\nputting it to bad use.\n\n59\n00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.920\nOr, you've exposed this\nunique identifier and\n\n60\n00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.820\nsomebody else has taken it on or\nit must be you, right?\n\n61\n00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:39.960\nIn other words you're lying,\n\n62\n00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.260\nright, because shame on you\nyou were there it was you.\n\n63\n00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.090\nNow this unique identifier that we use,\n\n64\n00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.030\nwe talked about this as\nwell on the last episode.\n\n65\n00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.610\nIf you had to guess what this is, what\n\n66\n00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.080\ndo you think the unique identifier would\nbe that we're gonna use to digitally sign?\n\n67\n00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.760\nWhat's gonna be that\ncritical key component?\n\n68\n00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.040\n&gt;&gt; A hash value?\n\n69\n00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.020\nNot the hash value.\n\n70\n00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.840\nThe hash value is the important part,\nbut it's how we get the hash value.\n\n71\n00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.370\nSo remember we talked about Mr.\nKirchhoff, Gus Kirchhoff's principle?\n\n72\n00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.300\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; The idea of not exposing one of those\n\n73\n00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.720\nkeys, and specifically which key?\n\n74\n00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.210\n&gt;&gt; Our private key.\n\n75\n00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:16.810\n&gt;&gt; Our private key, absolutely correct.\n\n76\n00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.890\nSo digital signatures is gonna allow us,\nor\n\n77\n00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.950\na digital signature allows us to provide\nand prove, beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n78\n00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.540\nAgain, there's always that little but,\nkind of the conversation,\n\n79\n00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.050\nthat little reasonable\ndoubt that we put in there.\n\n80\n00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.880\nThere's always the possibility\nsomebody could spoof or masquerade or\n\n81\n00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.240\npotentially steal our key and\nimpersonate us.\n\n82\n00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.180\nSo it's not 100% guaranteed.\n\n83\n00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.930\nBut what it is is a reasonable\nassumption and validity.\n\n84\n00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.550\nA reasonable assumption or proof.\n\n85\n00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.120\nThat it was,\nif the system is set up correctly.\n\n86\n00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.870\nAnd if we are following principle.\n\n87\n00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.630\nAnd if, there's a lot of and/ifs.\n\n88\n00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.120\nAnd if we are keeping\nour private key secure.\n\n89\n00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.490\nWe can safely and\n\n90\n00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.050\nreasonably operate at that point with the\nknowledge that the person that digitally\n\n91\n00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.500\nsigned the email could've only done so\nif they had access to the private key.\n\n92\n00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.850\nAnd since our private key in theory\nshould not be shared with anybody,\n\n93\n00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.610\nshould not be given to anybody under and\ncircumstances.\n\n94\n00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.380\nIf we as the owner are the only one who\nhas to find the key, The logic says or\n\n95\n00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.320\nthe thought process says,\n\n96\n00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.070\nwell then you're the only one\nthat could assign that message.\n\n97\n00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:25.490\nSo it's not unreasonable to assume that as\nlong as those operational constraints and\n\n98\n00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.610\nrequirements about key protection and\nprinciple are in play here.\n\n99\n00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.250\nBut the private key of\nthe individual must be kept secure.\n\n100\n00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.470\nSo let's talk about how\nthis actually works, right.\n\n101\n00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.520\nSo digital signatures provides\nauthenticity of a sender and\n\n102\n00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.030\nintegrity of a senders message,\nwe talked about that.\n\n103\n00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.810\nMessage is input into the hash function.\n\n104\n00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.130\nWell, we can see right above how\nwe input that variable data,\n\n105\n00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.770\nplus hashing algorithm,\nfixed bit stream output, or hash value.\n\n106\n00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.250\nIn the case of digital signature\nwe would simply substitute for\n\n107\n00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.450\nhash value, in parentheses,\nmessage digest.\n\n108\n00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:04.070\nCuz that's the hash value attached to the\nmessage and used as the digital signature.\n\n109\n00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.140\nThen the hash value's encrypted\nusing the private key of the sender.\n\n110\n00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.720\nResult of the two steps\nyields a digital signature.\n\n111\n00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.860\nSo the idea is that we\nwill hash the message, and\n\n112\n00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:19.620\nwe will use the private key of the sender\nwhoever is sending the message\n\n113\n00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:24.390\nto validate proof of origin,\nproof of identity.\n\n114\n00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.560\nNow when we use the private key,\npeople get concerned.\n\n115\n00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.930\nDoes that mean you're exposing the key?\n\n116\n00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.060\nYou said, Adam, never expose the key.\n\n117\n00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.180\nKeep it confidential.\n\n118\n00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.810\nKeep it secure.\n\n119\n00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.570\nDon't share it with anybody.\n\n120\n00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.850\nAre you gonna expose the key by\nusing the digital signature?\n\n121\n00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:41.110\nAnd are we sending the key or\n\n122\n00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.280\npresenting in such a way that people\ncould get it, the answers absolutely not.\n\n123\n00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.250\nIf you remember the definition\nof hash function right up above.\n\n124\n00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.990\nOne way mathematical operation reduces\nthe messenger data into a hash value or\n\n125\n00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.380\nmessage digest.\n\n126\n00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.640\nOne way implies we could go forward but\n\n127\n00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:03.410\nit's not reverse engineerable meaning it\nis, we say computationally infeasible.\n\n128\n00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:08.590\nIt is so difficult that it is considered\nimpossible under normal conditions\n\n129\n00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:13.040\nto reverse the hash and\nactually find the private key.\n\n130\n00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.460\nAnd so as a result, we're not gonna talk\nabout hash tables and rainbow tables and\n\n131\n00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.007\nall that just yet.\n\n132\n00:07:18.007 --> 00:07:19.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I wasn't going there.\n\n133\n00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:19.970\n&gt;&gt; Don't get too excited just yet.\n\n134\n00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:21.038\n&gt;&gt; I was thinking about eggs and omelets.\n\n135\n00:07:21.038 --> 00:07:23.670\nLet's\n&gt;&gt; And hashes?\n\n136\n00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:24.170\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n137\n00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:26.650\n&gt;&gt; What did you say computationally?\n\n138\n00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:27.970\n&gt;&gt; Computationally infeasible.\n\n139\n00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:28.790\n&gt;&gt; Infeasible.\n\n140\n00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.490\nI heard a good analogy one\ntime where you take the eggs,\n\n141\n00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:33.760\nyou scramble them all together and\nyou make an omelette.\n\n142\n00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.350\nThat's kind of the same concept.\n\n143\n00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:39.160\nIt's hard to dissect and\nput those eggs all back together.\n\n144\n00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.020\nWe call that the humpty dumpty analogy.\n\n145\n00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:41.590\n&gt;&gt; Okay cool I like it.\n\n146\n00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:43.040\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So if the dumpty falls off the wall\n\n147\n00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.690\nit's very hard to put him back together.\n\n148\n00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:45.630\nAll the king's horses,\n\n149\n00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:48.775\nall the king's men cannot put\nhumpty dumpty back together again.\n\n150\n00:07:48.775 --> 00:07:52.094\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Mother goose brought to you here\n\n151\n00:07:52.094 --> 00:07:52.607\nby ITPRO TV.\n\n152\n00:07:52.607 --> 00:07:56.000\nAll right we are, I like that that's\nthe scrambled diagonology we can now\n\n153\n00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.026\nincorporate that in our conversation\nI haven't heard that one.\n\n154\n00:07:59.026 --> 00:08:00.583\nWell before, actually, but I like that.\n\n155\n00:08:00.583 --> 00:08:03.533\nSo we can dissect and\nseparate out the eggs, in other words.\n\n156\n00:08:03.533 --> 00:08:04.160\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n157\n00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.869\n&gt;&gt; That's the point of the analogy\nwe don't know whose eggs are whose.\n\n158\n00:08:05.869 --> 00:08:06.455\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n159\n00:08:06.455 --> 00:08:08.325\n&gt;&gt; You just get everybody's all\nscrambled together in one place.\n\n160\n00:08:08.325 --> 00:08:13.659\nSo we're going to now call this\nscrambled egg Cherokee process,\n\n161\n00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:15.646\nCherokee scrambled eggs.\n\n162\n00:08:15.646 --> 00:08:18.302\nSo that is the basically the same idea I\nactually like that a lot I haven't heard\n\n163\n00:08:18.302 --> 00:08:20.610\nthat before but that's actually not\na bad way of thinking about it.\n\n164\n00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:23.023\nBecause it does put everything\ntogether in a common bowl.\n\n165\n00:08:23.023 --> 00:08:25.788\nYou kind of mix it all up which is\nwhat we're doing and it becomes so\n\n166\n00:08:25.788 --> 00:08:29.610\ndifficult to really separate out all\nthe parts like you were suggesting that.\n\n167\n00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.400\nIt means that we've basically\ndone our job right.\n\n168\n00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.550\nIf we scramble it and nobody can tell\nwhat's what, then nobody's able to see, or\n\n169\n00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:38.870\nunderstand, or divine the key.\n\n170\n00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:42.300\nAnd that's the goal of Kerckhoff's\nprinciple, keep the private key secure.\n\n171\n00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.770\nBut if we use the key to\nauthoritatively represent our identity\n\n172\n00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:50.300\nin a secure way without exposing it, we've\naccomplished something very important.\n\n173\n00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.800\nWhich is, we've proved beyond\na reasonable doubt it's us.\n\n174\n00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.397\nBut done so in a way that we have not\nexposed the one the thing that validates\n\n175\n00:08:56.397 --> 00:08:59.832\nus so that other people can impersonate\nus, which is the private key.\n\n176\n00:08:59.832 --> 00:09:04.809\nSo by using the private key to generate\nthat information we can take that private\n\n177\n00:09:04.809 --> 00:09:09.786\nkey and we can validate it against a\npublic key, we're talking about a public,\n\n178\n00:09:09.786 --> 00:09:11.737\nprivate key pair now, right?\n\n179\n00:09:11.737 --> 00:09:14.215\nSo we're talking about\nan asymmetric function,\n\n180\n00:09:14.215 --> 00:09:15.930\nas we defined in the last episode.\n\n181\n00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.660\nYou'll see I left them on the screen down\nthere specifically so we could go up and\n\n182\n00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:24.130\ndown in our conversations and\nall around the idea of digital signatures.\n\n183\n00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:27.080\nBut with an asymmetric system\npublic private key pair,\n\n184\n00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.100\nif I use the private key.\n\n185\n00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:33.230\nThen I can validate it with\nthe mathematically related corresponding\n\n186\n00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:34.360\npublic key.\n\n187\n00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.580\nPublic keys are available to anybody\nwho wants to see them freely.\n\n188\n00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.470\nWe store them in LDAP servers.\n\n189\n00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:41.830\nYou may know them as domain\ncontrollers in Windows.\n\n190\n00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:45.189\nEnvironments, if you use PGP.\n\n191\n00:09:45.189 --> 00:09:47.457\nYou may know PGP, pretty good privacy.\n\n192\n00:09:47.457 --> 00:09:50.063\nIf you use PGP,\nwe store them on key servers,\n\n193\n00:09:50.063 --> 00:09:54.215\ntypically Internet facing key servers\nto let you download the keys.\n\n194\n00:09:54.215 --> 00:09:56.497\nAnd/or you store them on\nwhat are known as key rings.\n\n195\n00:09:56.497 --> 00:09:59.811\nYou essentially have an app that stores\nthem and keeps track of them for\n\n196\n00:09:59.811 --> 00:10:00.833\nyou on your machine.\n\n197\n00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:02.763\nWhen you digitally sign and email,\n\n198\n00:10:02.763 --> 00:10:06.250\nyou're not in there figuring out\nthe mathematics and the bits.\n\n199\n00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:09.210\nYou hit a button and the mail program,\nOutlook or SendMail,\n\n200\n00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.660\nwhatever it is, does all this for you.\n\n201\n00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:16.379\nAnd when you wanna digitally sign the\nmessage, It pulls your private key in from\n\n202\n00:10:16.379 --> 00:10:20.394\nthe key store, the LDAP directory or\nthe local certificate store,\n\n203\n00:10:20.394 --> 00:10:23.865\non your system where the keys\nare gonna be made available.\n\n204\n00:10:23.865 --> 00:10:26.673\nMaybe through your TPM,\nyour trusted platform module or\n\n205\n00:10:26.673 --> 00:10:30.730\nyour HSM your hardware security module,\nwherever two keys are stored.\n\n206\n00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:32.170\nWe pull that key in,\n\n207\n00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:35.763\nmathematically we run the algorithms\nbehind the scenes in the software and\n\n208\n00:10:35.763 --> 00:10:40.380\nwe generate the to the message It's all\ndone in, literally, the push of a button.\n\n209\n00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:44.390\nYou just hit a button, you get out of\nthe way, and the app does everything.\n\n210\n00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:46.418\nAnd you just hit Send,\nand the system goes.\n\n211\n00:10:46.418 --> 00:10:48.274\nHave you ever gotten\na digitally signed email?\n\n212\n00:10:48.274 --> 00:10:49.123\n&gt;&gt; I have, military.\n\n213\n00:10:49.123 --> 00:10:49.901\n&gt;&gt; So when you get them.\n\n214\n00:10:49.901 --> 00:10:50.616\nYeah, that kind of stuff.\n\n215\n00:10:50.616 --> 00:10:52.125\nEspecially government, military do that.\n\n216\n00:10:52.125 --> 00:10:54.985\nIt comes in with that little\nred flag on it, or the ribbon.\n\n217\n00:10:54.985 --> 00:10:57.353\nLooks like a first place or\nsecond place ribbon at the state fair.\n\n218\n00:10:57.353 --> 00:10:58.028\n&gt;&gt; You won!\n\n219\n00:10:58.028 --> 00:10:59.817\n&gt;&gt; The blue one and the red one, right?\n\n220\n00:10:59.817 --> 00:11:01.077\nAnd so you get that and\n\n221\n00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:05.907\nif you don't have the right information\navailable meaning the public key is not in\n\n222\n00:11:05.907 --> 00:11:09.694\nyour system to validate the signature\nof the sender it comes up.\n\n223\n00:11:09.694 --> 00:11:12.602\nAnd alerts you and\nsays hey signature cannot be validated.\n\n224\n00:11:12.602 --> 00:11:16.730\nClick here or whatever the equivalent\nwould be based on the software you use.\n\n225\n00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:20.050\nAnd it goes out, it being the application,\nOutlook, whatever.\n\n226\n00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:23.714\nTries to get the public key from\nthe system, to validate the signature,\n\n227\n00:11:23.714 --> 00:11:26.368\nto prove it's really the person\nthat sent it to you.\n\n228\n00:11:26.368 --> 00:11:29.752\nAnd it does the match and if it does it\ncomes up and says signature is valid or\n\n229\n00:11:29.752 --> 00:11:30.360\nvalidated.\n\n230\n00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:34.267\nOr how ever it presents that information\nif it doesn't it lets you see the mail but\n\n231\n00:11:34.267 --> 00:11:37.139\nit just tells you that we can't\nvalid the signature because\n\n232\n00:11:37.139 --> 00:11:39.330\nsometimes public keys\nmay not be available.\n\n233\n00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.730\nYou may not be able to get\nto a server that has them.\n\n234\n00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:44.402\nMaybe they're not made available\noutside the organization.\n\n235\n00:11:44.402 --> 00:11:47.524\nThere's different reasons why you might\nnot be able to get the public key.\n\n236\n00:11:47.524 --> 00:11:51.095\nSo we could see it, it's just that it may\nnot be able to authoritatively [CROSSTALK]\n\n237\n00:11:51.095 --> 00:11:54.068\nprove it beyond a reasonable doubt\nat the moment we get the message.\n\n238\n00:11:54.068 --> 00:11:55.760\nSo that's what a digital signature is.\n\n239\n00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.000\nSo we'll talk more about this.\n\n240\n00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.108\nWe've got some cool little diagrams\nthat we're gonna take a look at.\n\n241\n00:12:00.108 --> 00:12:03.927\nAnd Bob and Alice are gonna join us for\nanother version of this program later on,\n\n242\n00:12:03.927 --> 00:12:05.126\nanother episode or two.\n\n243\n00:12:05.126 --> 00:12:08.195\nBob and Alice are our friends that we\nuse to talk about cryptography with.\n\n244\n00:12:08.195 --> 00:12:09.252\nThey're little stick figure people.\n\n245\n00:12:09.252 --> 00:12:10.103\nThey're very nice.\n\n246\n00:12:10.103 --> 00:12:11.938\n&gt;&gt; See,\nI told you that I do have some friends.\n\n247\n00:12:11.938 --> 00:12:13.926\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; She does, and they don't eat or\n\n248\n00:12:13.926 --> 00:12:14.655\ndrink anything.\n\n249\n00:12:14.655 --> 00:12:15.929\nYou can invite them over all the time.\n\n250\n00:12:15.929 --> 00:12:16.787\nThey're very great house guests.\n\n251\n00:12:16.787 --> 00:12:17.967\nThey never say a word.\n\n252\n00:12:17.967 --> 00:12:19.720\nThey just sit in the corner and\nthey don't do anything.\n\n253\n00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.640\nBut we're gonna invite them to spend\nsome time with us in an upcoming\n\n254\n00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.640\nepisode or two.\n\n255\n00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:27.100\nCherokee has put together some\ndiagrams for us and we're gonna use\n\n256\n00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.620\nthose to actually go through in a little\nmore depth this and show you some picture.\n\n257\n00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:34.450\nBut in the meantime, just make sure\nyou're understanding, comfortable, and\n\n258\n00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:38.970\nfamiliar with the concepts of hashing,\ndigital signature, symmetric and\n\n259\n00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:42.000\nasymmetric encryption,\nas we've been through already.\n\n260\n00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.820\nJust gonna scroll down here a little bit.\n\n261\n00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:48.680\nNow another part of what we were\ntalking about with digital signatures,\n\n262\n00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:52.360\nwas the idea that the private key\ncan be represented and stored, and\n\n263\n00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.030\nit can be represented and\nstored in a digital certificate.\n\n264\n00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:59.332\nAnd so we wanna bring in the certificates,\nthe certificate authority,\n\n265\n00:12:59.332 --> 00:13:02.585\nwhat we broadly and commonly call,\nor refer to as PKI.\n\n266\n00:13:02.585 --> 00:13:04.444\nPublic key infrastructure.\n\n267\n00:13:04.444 --> 00:13:08.514\nAnd what we wanna do is just little talk\nat several pictures we're gonna show you\n\n268\n00:13:08.514 --> 00:13:11.030\nhere in a minute about how PKI is set up,\nhow it works.\n\n269\n00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:14.140\nBut the building blocks of PKI,\nwe have digital certificates.\n\n270\n00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:17.600\nThese are gonna be used to identify\nthe holder as you can see when we are,\n\n271\n00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:21.510\nwhoever the holder is,\nthe identity of the certificate holder.\n\n272\n00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:26.153\nWhen we do that we have a certificate\nversion known as x.509v3 you can see it on\n\n273\n00:13:26.153 --> 00:13:30.749\nthe screen, current version of digital\ncertificates commonly used globally.\n\n274\n00:13:30.749 --> 00:13:35.547\nThat is the template version,\nv 3 version 3 of the certificate,\n\n275\n00:13:35.547 --> 00:13:39.700\ntemplate known as x.509 or\nthe standard x.509.\n\n276\n00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:43.654\nThe certificates themselves,\nthat particular standard, that template,\n\n277\n00:13:43.654 --> 00:13:46.162\nhave certain fields that\nare always published.\n\n278\n00:13:46.162 --> 00:13:49.380\nWe have a certificate holder name,\nthe validity period,\n\n279\n00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.250\nthe use of the certificates.\n\n280\n00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:55.430\nYou have the certificate key or\nthe sign in key and the hash and all that.\n\n281\n00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:57.830\nAll those fields are mapped out\non the certificate template.\n\n282\n00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:00.738\nAnd that's what we mean\nwhen we refer to X.509 v3.\n\n283\n00:14:00.738 --> 00:14:01.660\n&gt;&gt; Because they can't change.\n\n284\n00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:05.885\nOnce people already, so\nwe can't have a universal certificate for\n\n285\n00:14:05.885 --> 00:14:08.119\ndifferent types of certificates.\n\n286\n00:14:08.119 --> 00:14:10.669\nTo go back and say if I create\na certificate to validate you,\n\n287\n00:14:10.669 --> 00:14:13.279\nI can't go back and say, no,\nI meant to validate Cherokee.\n\n288\n00:14:13.279 --> 00:14:16.315\nI kind of thing, that once we put that\ninformation in, that it's good to go.\n\n289\n00:14:18.706 --> 00:14:19.487\nDoes that make sense?\n\n290\n00:14:19.487 --> 00:14:20.288\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no.\n\n291\n00:14:20.288 --> 00:14:20.954\nNot really.\n\n292\n00:14:20.954 --> 00:14:22.127\nYes, I understand what you're saying.\n\n293\n00:14:22.127 --> 00:14:24.558\nBut I'm saying no, I'm just mulling\nthrough in my mind what you just said.\n\n294\n00:14:24.558 --> 00:14:25.979\nSo what you said.\n\n295\n00:14:25.979 --> 00:14:27.446\nYes, technically.\n\n296\n00:14:27.446 --> 00:14:28.949\nBut let's adjust that just a little bit.\n\n297\n00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:29.481\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n298\n00:14:29.481 --> 00:14:33.853\n&gt;&gt; So it's not that we can't modify it\nbecause what we wanna say is we don't\n\n299\n00:14:33.853 --> 00:14:36.590\nmodify it or\nwe invalidate the certificate.\n\n300\n00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:37.280\nI know what you meant.\n\n301\n00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:40.030\nAnd I know that's essentially\nwhat you were trying to say.\n\n302\n00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:43.999\nBut lets make that a little clearer\nbecause it's not that we couldn't\n\n303\n00:14:43.999 --> 00:14:46.958\nmodify it,\nbecause in theory you can modify it, but\n\n304\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:51.278\nwhen you modify it, we then trend to\nrender that certificate invalidated.\n\n305\n00:14:51.278 --> 00:14:55.340\nAnd there's a lot of reasons why\ncertificates may be invalidated, but\n\n306\n00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:58.875\nwe also wanna understand that\ncertificates may also expire.\n\n307\n00:14:58.875 --> 00:15:01.646\nWe have what are called\nthe validity period, or the TTL,\n\n308\n00:15:01.646 --> 00:15:03.395\nyou can think of it different ways.\n\n309\n00:15:03.395 --> 00:15:05.641\nAnd during that period,\nthe certificate once issued,\n\n310\n00:15:05.641 --> 00:15:07.410\nas Cherokee rightly pointed out.\n\n311\n00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:10.150\nShe's right to call us out on this and\nmake us focus on the idea that\n\n312\n00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.930\ncertificates should be static,\nessentially, right, what you were saying.\n\n313\n00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:16.150\nWhen we issue them,\nit's really important to see them\n\n314\n00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:20.120\nas objects that are gonna be static,\nand uniquely used, and\n\n315\n00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.900\nbinding to the identity of the individual\nor the entity that we issue them to.\n\n316\n00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.320\nAnd as a result they\nshould not be modified but\n\n317\n00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.580\nif we do modify them and\nthere may be reason why we need to.\n\n318\n00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:35.520\nWe may invalidate it because maybe the\nnecessity for the certificate has changed.\n\n319\n00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:39.340\nMaybe somebody has somehow spoofed or\nmasqueraded and\n\n320\n00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:42.470\nthe certificate has become invalid and\nas a result we have to reissue it under\n\n321\n00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:47.300\nthe guise of a new Identity,\nor we have not paid our bill.\n\n322\n00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:48.230\nAnd so as a result,\n\n323\n00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:51.910\nsomebody reclaims their property because\ncertificates don't belong to us.\n\n324\n00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.632\nWe usually buy them or\nrent them from a third party.\n\n325\n00:15:54.632 --> 00:15:58.267\nEven if we self-sign them and issue them\nourselves, we may invalidate them and\n\n326\n00:15:58.267 --> 00:16:00.284\nreissue new ones for\na variety of a reasons.\n\n327\n00:16:00.284 --> 00:16:02.701\nSo it is a very good thought process.\n\n328\n00:16:02.701 --> 00:16:04.188\n100% in alignment with you.\n\n329\n00:16:04.188 --> 00:16:07.271\nBut we just want to make sure we\nunderstand that certificates typically as\n\n330\n00:16:07.271 --> 00:16:09.240\nyou said are issued for a period of time.\n\n331\n00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.350\nThey are static.\n\n332\n00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:15.530\nWe do modify them, but when we do so we\ntend to invalidate them and reissue them.\n\n333\n00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:19.120\nAnd as a result certificates\nmay change over time.\n\n334\n00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.180\nBut their usually only issued for\n\n335\n00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:25.190\na very specific purpose based\non the insure statement.\n\n336\n00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:27.540\nAnd the fields that we\nselect in order to do that.\n\n337\n00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:30.070\nAnd then as you pointed out,\nthey're static and should not change\n\n338\n00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:33.560\nduring the validity period, unless\nwe invalidate them and reissue them.\n\n339\n00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:36.665\nSo that's exactly correct, you wanna think\nof it that way, and that's what I was\n\n340\n00:16:36.665 --> 00:16:39.190\ntrying to get straight in my head\nas you were talking through that.\n\n341\n00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:42.369\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] And of course if we do\nretract those, we do wanna publish them on\n\n342\n00:16:42.369 --> 00:16:45.722\nour CRL list so people know about it and\nthey have a good idea not to trust them.\n\n343\n00:16:45.722 --> 00:16:49.251\n&gt;&gt; Well so it's interesting,\nthere's two approaches to the CRL.\n\n344\n00:16:49.251 --> 00:16:51.331\nWe're jumping out of order\nhere a little bit but\n\n345\n00:16:51.331 --> 00:16:53.731\nwe're gonna put this all back\ntogether as part of PKI.\n\n346\n00:16:53.731 --> 00:16:54.240\n&gt;&gt; Sorry.\n\n347\n00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:58.370\n&gt;&gt; CRL, or Certificate Revocation List,\nis the idea.\n\n348\n00:16:58.370 --> 00:16:59.522\nNever apologize for being right.\n\n349\n00:16:59.522 --> 00:17:01.030\nThere's nothing wrong with doing that.\n\n350\n00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.360\nWe just gotta expand our conversation\na little bit to include that.\n\n351\n00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:03.980\nThat's all.\n\n352\n00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:06.000\nBut what you said is absolutely correct,\nright?\n\n353\n00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.040\nApologize if you're wrong, but you're not\nwrong so never apologize if you're right.\n\n354\n00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.720\nSo the CRL, Certificate Revocation List,\nwhich Cherokee brought up,\n\n355\n00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:13.990\ntwo interesting things.\n\n356\n00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:18.590\nSo she said when we do that, people would\nknow if we invalidated the certificates.\n\n357\n00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:22.080\nSo not necessarily, and\nthis is the interesting part about PKI.\n\n358\n00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:27.050\nHistorically, up until several years ago,\nthe CRL process was manual.\n\n359\n00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:32.027\nMeaning you as the person who wanted to\ncheck the validity of the certificate.\n\n360\n00:17:32.027 --> 00:17:35.630\nThe person who's gonna accept the\ncertificate in theory, not the issuer, but\n\n361\n00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:37.260\nthe person who's gonna accept it.\n\n362\n00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.937\nHad to go out and validate against\nthe CRL that was published somewhere,\n\n363\n00:17:40.937 --> 00:17:44.090\neither downloaded, or\nsomehow validated against it.\n\n364\n00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:47.350\nBut there was not necessarily\nan automated process to do that.\n\n365\n00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:51.620\nYou may have to download a spreadsheet or\na list, and look at it to see whether or\n\n366\n00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:53.070\nnot the certificate was valid.\n\n367\n00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:56.807\nNow, you could automate that because you\nhad software that would go pull that\n\n368\n00:17:56.807 --> 00:17:59.638\nevery so often, do a cross walk,\nflag the certificates.\n\n369\n00:17:59.638 --> 00:18:02.118\nYou in theory could and\nindeed would automate it, but\n\n370\n00:18:02.118 --> 00:18:04.830\nit was not a standardized\nway of automating it.\n\n371\n00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:08.142\nA few years back we started\nusing something called OCSP,\n\n372\n00:18:08.142 --> 00:18:13.041\nthe online certificate status protocol,\nwhich allows us to automate the process,\n\n373\n00:18:13.041 --> 00:18:15.049\nthe CR revocation list checking.\n\n374\n00:18:15.049 --> 00:18:19.508\nSo that now applications will use those\nCSP as a standardized way to do this and\n\n375\n00:18:19.508 --> 00:18:23.350\nyes now we should be aware of it\nbecause it should be automated, but\n\n376\n00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:24.528\nnot all of the time.\n\n377\n00:18:24.528 --> 00:18:28.190\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] So most of our browsers\nsupport what was the acronym, OSCP.\n\n378\n00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:29.524\n&gt;&gt; All the current browsers,\n\n379\n00:18:29.524 --> 00:18:32.195\n[CROSSTALK] the current\nversions of them we should say.\n\n380\n00:18:32.195 --> 00:18:34.017\nSo not Netscape for instance, right, for\n\n381\n00:18:34.017 --> 00:18:36.253\nthose of you that are back\nin the 90s reminiscing.\n\n382\n00:18:36.253 --> 00:18:37.518\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But anything more current.\n\n383\n00:18:37.518 --> 00:18:41.101\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; So any current version of IE, Firefox,\n\n384\n00:18:41.101 --> 00:18:42.930\nSafari, Chrome.\n\n385\n00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:44.690\nAny of those all support the use of OCSP,\n\n386\n00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:46.970\nat least the most modern\nversions of them will.\n\n387\n00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:49.558\nSo yes, absolutely,\nthat's gonna be good to point out as well.\n\n388\n00:18:49.558 --> 00:18:51.098\nWell that's a high five right there.\n\n389\n00:18:51.098 --> 00:18:51.628\n&gt;&gt; Ooh.\n\n390\n00:18:51.628 --> 00:18:52.847\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're just spot on with all that\n\n391\n00:18:52.847 --> 00:18:53.354\nstuff today.\n\n392\n00:18:53.354 --> 00:18:56.553\nI'm going to have to keep dancing and stay\non my toes to answer all these questions.\n\n393\n00:18:56.553 --> 00:18:59.944\nAll right so digital certificates, talked\na little bit about the concept overall.\n\n394\n00:18:59.944 --> 00:19:03.513\nNow, where we go to see\ncertificates varies by application,\n\n395\n00:19:03.513 --> 00:19:05.900\nby operating system, by platform.\n\n396\n00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:09.030\nWe have certificates stores\nlocal in most machines.\n\n397\n00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:12.723\nThose of you used to using\na Microsoft-centric piece of software,\n\n398\n00:19:12.723 --> 00:19:15.334\nwhether it's an application,\na desktop etc.\n\n399\n00:19:15.334 --> 00:19:19.240\nYou may have seen certificates in\nInternet Explorer for instance.\n\n400\n00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.464\nChrome you can see them in there,\nall the browsers have them.\n\n401\n00:19:21.464 --> 00:19:24.065\nIt's just in Chrome you've got\nto go to advanced settings, and\n\n402\n00:19:24.065 --> 00:19:26.152\nthey're buried like\n[CROSSTALK] 25 layers deep.\n\n403\n00:19:26.152 --> 00:19:28.480\nThey really don't want you to see them,\nbut they're like, all right, look.\n\n404\n00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.140\nIf you get here, and\nyou can actually find them,\n\n405\n00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:34.920\nwe might as well show them to you cuz boy,\nyou really are tenacious.\n\n406\n00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:38.440\nAnd I either like, yeah,\nthey're right here, just close the door,\n\n407\n00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:39.820\nturn off the lights when you're done.\n\n408\n00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:43.633\nI mean it's so easy to find them in\ncertain browsers and others, literally.\n\n409\n00:19:43.633 --> 00:19:47.709\nThe first time I went to Chrome to try to\nfind certificates It was like I was on\n\n410\n00:19:47.709 --> 00:19:49.274\na treasure quest with a map.\n\n411\n00:19:49.274 --> 00:19:50.450\nAnd I had to take water and\n\n412\n00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:53.146\nI had to take food because it\nwas going to take three days.\n\n413\n00:19:53.146 --> 00:19:53.786\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] My gosh.\n\n414\n00:19:53.786 --> 00:19:55.841\n&gt;&gt; And then every time you click on\nanother link then you think okay it's\n\n415\n00:19:55.841 --> 00:19:56.344\nfinally there.\n\n416\n00:19:56.344 --> 00:19:58.395\nThey're like no, this,\nwe were just kidding before.\n\n417\n00:19:58.395 --> 00:20:03.106\n&gt;&gt; I think it's under like http and\nthen ssl and you've got to dig.\n\n418\n00:20:03.106 --> 00:20:03.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\n\n419\n00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:07.180\nyou need earth moving equipment and\nexplosives to be able to get to them.\n\n420\n00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:10.710\nSo wherever you go whatever you\ndo right you can see them there.\n\n421\n00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:15.700\nAnd there is in Windows and MMC, Microsoft\nManagement Consult, a shell you can add in\n\n422\n00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.520\nfor the certificate snap in to see\nthe certificates in local store.\n\n423\n00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.030\nThere's different ways to do that.\n\n424\n00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:22.980\nWe'll take a look real quick and take\na look at a certificate here in a minute.\n\n425\n00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:27.697\nBut the certification authority concept\nis the structure hierarchy of PKI.\n\n426\n00:20:27.697 --> 00:20:31.195\nSo what I wanna do just by talking\nthrough this with root and subordinate\n\n427\n00:20:31.195 --> 00:20:34.634\nCAs I wanna bring up the picture to\nhelp us to put this in perspective and\n\n428\n00:20:34.634 --> 00:20:36.380\ntalk through them real quick.\n\n429\n00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.328\nThere's also something known as the RA,\n\n430\n00:20:38.328 --> 00:20:40.617\nthe registration authority\nwhich is optional.\n\n431\n00:20:40.617 --> 00:20:43.717\nYou may or may not see it on PKI\nimplementations, depends on how you're\n\n432\n00:20:43.717 --> 00:20:46.780\nimplement it, we'll see that as\na picture just so you know what it is.\n\n433\n00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:50.352\nAnd there's something known as\nthe verification authority, the VA,\n\n434\n00:20:50.352 --> 00:20:53.578\nwhich is like an RA in some\ninstallations and implementations.\n\n435\n00:20:53.578 --> 00:20:57.437\nBut it's essentially the LDAP provider\nthat gives you directory services,\n\n436\n00:20:57.437 --> 00:20:59.646\nwhere certificates are typically stored.\n\n437\n00:20:59.646 --> 00:21:03.336\nAnd where you go to validate the identity\nof the issuance of the certificate,\n\n438\n00:21:03.336 --> 00:21:06.180\nand make sure that the certificate\nis actually accurate.\n\n439\n00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:08.650\nSo, we'll see that in the diagram as well,\njust so\n\n440\n00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:10.330\nyou know what the moving parts are.\n\n441\n00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:11.754\nBut let's bring this up,\n\n442\n00:21:11.754 --> 00:21:15.399\njust an image right off of\nthe Wikipedia site if I'm not mistaken.\n\n443\n00:21:15.399 --> 00:21:18.876\nWe found that out there Wikipedia\ncommons so we want to thank them for\n\n444\n00:21:18.876 --> 00:21:22.520\nthe ability to use this graphic\njust to help us talk about things.\n\n445\n00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:24.520\nSaved me the trouble of having\nto sketch this thing out,\n\n446\n00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:28.210\nbecause if I drew it you wouldn't be\nable to read what it says trust me.\n\n447\n00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:30.419\nI always wanted to be a doctor\nwhen I was growing up as a kid,\n\n448\n00:21:30.419 --> 00:21:31.961\nmy handwriting never quite recovered.\n\n449\n00:21:31.961 --> 00:21:32.489\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n450\n00:21:32.489 --> 00:21:37.368\nto this day my hand still thinks it's a\ndoctor even though I've moved on and I've\n\n451\n00:21:37.368 --> 00:21:41.991\nnow become a person who's not a doctor but\nstill writes like he was, right.\n\n452\n00:21:41.991 --> 00:21:43.605\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So actually I was, totally random,\n\n453\n00:21:43.605 --> 00:21:45.936\nthis is our random aside by the way,\ntotally random aside.\n\n454\n00:21:45.936 --> 00:21:49.008\nSo I was at a family function this past\nweekend before I came back up to do\n\n455\n00:21:49.008 --> 00:21:50.500\nthe show with you guys.\n\n456\n00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.382\nAnd it was my great uncle's 90th birthday.\n\n457\n00:21:52.382 --> 00:21:54.157\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; And it's a pretty big milestone,\n\n458\n00:21:54.157 --> 00:21:55.620\nit's a huge milestone.\n\n459\n00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:57.350\nAnd so we went, it was great.\n\n460\n00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:00.230\nDid a brunch and\nthe whole family came together.\n\n461\n00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:01.490\nIt was really nice.\n\n462\n00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:02.957\nAnd so normally somebody gets up,\n\n463\n00:22:02.957 --> 00:22:05.090\nsays a few words when they\ndo something like this.\n\n464\n00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:08.497\nSo instead of him getting up and\ntalking about,\n\n465\n00:22:08.497 --> 00:22:12.340\nhey, 90 years old,\nthis is awesome and whatever.\n\n466\n00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:13.990\nInstead he gets up says\nokay here's the deal.\n\n467\n00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:16.070\nMy great uncle's a big jokester.\n\n468\n00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:17.610\nHe gets up and says here's the deal.\n\n469\n00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:21.178\nI'm not going to bore you with a long\nspeech and stories instead I'm going to\n\n470\n00:22:21.178 --> 00:22:23.978\ntalk about all the people that\nhave come here for the party.\n\n471\n00:22:23.978 --> 00:22:25.467\nI'm going to say a little\nbit about everybody.\n\n472\n00:22:25.467 --> 00:22:29.661\nIn the family, a lot of you don't know\neach other cuz a lot of his friends he\n\n473\n00:22:29.661 --> 00:22:32.410\ngrew up with are there\nthat I've never met.\n\n474\n00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:34.934\nSo he's like I want you to meet my family\nand I wanna introduce everybody, so\n\n475\n00:22:34.934 --> 00:22:35.689\nthat's what he does.\n\n476\n00:22:35.689 --> 00:22:38.574\nSo he goes down the list cuz he's 90 and\nhe doesn't remember everything.\n\n477\n00:22:38.574 --> 00:22:42.644\nSo he's going down the list, and he's\nintroducing everybody, taking about them,\n\n478\n00:22:42.644 --> 00:22:45.120\ncalls on me and says,\nhey Adam, are you here?\n\n479\n00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.595\nStood up.\nI'm there with my family,\n\n480\n00:22:46.595 --> 00:22:47.404\nmy wife, my girls.\n\n481\n00:22:47.404 --> 00:22:49.290\nSo he said yeah,\nmake sure everybody stand up.\n\n482\n00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:51.669\nWe're in a room as big as this.\n\n483\n00:22:51.669 --> 00:22:53.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, makes everybody stand up.\n\n484\n00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.294\nSo stand up I wave.\n\n485\n00:22:55.294 --> 00:22:56.559\nYes, you know I'm here.\n\n486\n00:22:56.559 --> 00:22:59.216\nAnd he introduced me and he says,\nokay, and this is what he does, blah,\n\n487\n00:22:59.216 --> 00:22:59.980\nblah, blah.\n\n488\n00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:01.183\nAnd by the way, he has a PhD.\n\n489\n00:23:01.183 --> 00:23:02.493\nI don't have a PhD.\n\n490\n00:23:02.493 --> 00:23:06.779\nHe has a PhD in like computer security and\nhe just goes on and on and on.\n\n491\n00:23:06.779 --> 00:23:08.494\nAnd it's not what I have at all.\n\n492\n00:23:08.494 --> 00:23:12.600\nBut then afterwards, so my kids are now,\ncuz teenagers are idiots.\n\n493\n00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:16.651\nSo afterwards my girls are like do\nwe have to call you Doctor now?\n\n494\n00:23:16.651 --> 00:23:20.747\nSo yes, now I'm Dr Adam, so that's\nthe totally random aside and joke for\n\n495\n00:23:20.747 --> 00:23:22.100\nthis episode so.\n\n496\n00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:26.200\nI'm gonna explain this to you as if I\nwas Dr Adam even though I'm really not.\n\n497\n00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.910\nSo let's talk about PKI and\ncertificates right.\n\n498\n00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:31.700\nSo the idea here is that we have the CA,\n\n499\n00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:34.390\nthe certificate authority,\nwhich is sitting over here.\n\n500\n00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:36.290\nNow, there's two types of CAs.\n\n501\n00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:41.090\nThere is the root CA, and\nthere is the subordinate CA.\n\n502\n00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:44.170\nThink of this as a parent-child\nrelationship, essentially a hierarchy.\n\n503\n00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:49.470\nSo the root CA sits at the top of\nthe hierarchy issue certificates\n\n504\n00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:53.670\nto other certificate authorities\nthat are subordinates, below it.\n\n505\n00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:57.403\nSo the parent essentially gives\ncertificates to the children,\n\n506\n00:23:57.403 --> 00:23:58.515\nsubordinate CAs.\n\n507\n00:23:58.515 --> 00:24:02.417\nNow, the subordinate CAs will\nactually take those certificates,\n\n508\n00:24:02.417 --> 00:24:05.909\ngiving them permission to operate,\nand then turn around and\n\n509\n00:24:05.909 --> 00:24:07.905\nissue certificates of their own.\n\n510\n00:24:07.905 --> 00:24:12.777\nTwo individuals like our little sharply\ndressed gentleman here who wants to\n\n511\n00:24:12.777 --> 00:24:15.980\nget a certificate to be\nable to do something.\n\n512\n00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:19.420\nSo when we get a certificate\nin a PKI infrastructure\n\n513\n00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:21.590\nyou're not getting it\nfrom a root authority.\n\n514\n00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:25.970\nYou're getting it from a subordinate\nauthority that has been given permission\n\n515\n00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:28.630\nby the root to operate on it's behalf.\n\n516\n00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:29.560\nAnd the reason for\n\n517\n00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:34.180\nthis is that if you got a certificate\ndirectly from the root as a user, or\n\n518\n00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:38.250\na computer in the system, and that\ncertificate was spoofed for compromised\n\n519\n00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:42.820\nas we've talked about before, all\ncertificates from that root are seen as\n\n520\n00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:47.090\nbeing illegitimate at that point because\nthey could potentially have been spoofed.\n\n521\n00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:51.530\nAnd imagine for a minute the chaos\nthat would ensue if Microsoft or\n\n522\n00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:54.330\nGoogle or Amazon or VMWare or Citrix or\n\n523\n00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:57.550\nany of the big technology firms\naround the world, whoever they are,\n\n524\n00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:02.040\nall of them have root CAs that they\nuse to root certificates through.\n\n525\n00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:07.600\nImagine if that root CA at Microsoft for\ncertificates for software, digital\n\n526\n00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:12.810\nsigning of software, validity of software\nupdates, security updates, patches, etc.\n\n527\n00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:15.460\nImagine of that root CA was compromised.\n\n528\n00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:19.450\nEvery piece of software Microsoft\nhas put out under that certificate\n\n529\n00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:22.390\nStandard from that root would\nhave to be called back.\n\n530\n00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:23.030\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n531\n00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:26.140\n&gt;&gt; Would have to have new certificates\nissued, or it wold all be invalidated.\n\n532\n00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:29.810\nI mean, that would essentially\nbring the world as we know it,\n\n533\n00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:32.500\nin the corporate world anyway\non the desktops, to a halt.\n\n534\n00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:35.220\nBecause imagine,\nevery piece of corporate software we own\n\n535\n00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:38.520\nis signed under one of those\nroot CAs from Microsoft.\n\n536\n00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:39.790\nThat would be a huge issue.\n\n537\n00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:41.820\n&gt;&gt; So we're kind of going back to my eggs.\n\n538\n00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:42.790\nI don't know why.\n\n539\n00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:45.840\nBut we're not putting all of our\neggs in one basket, so to speak.\n\n540\n00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.570\nWe're separating our eggs\nout into multiple baskets.\n\n541\n00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:51.108\nAnd a lot of times-\n&gt;&gt; That's like egg 2.0 right there.\n\n542\n00:25:51.108 --> 00:25:52.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's strong egg fu.\n\n543\n00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.540\nThat is just really good egg Kung-fu.\n\n544\n00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:55.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we're separating them.\n\n545\n00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:59.500\nWe're not putting them all into one\nbasket, or a series of baskets are used,\n\n546\n00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:00.780\ngreat way of thinking about it.\n\n547\n00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:03.510\nBecause if we set up a stand off,\nessentially,\n\n548\n00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:08.150\na hierarchy that allows us to cut out from\nthe route to one or more subordinates.\n\n549\n00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:10.690\nThen if the subordinates CAs compromised,\n\n550\n00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:14.930\nthe certificates under that subordinates\nhave to be deadened and reissued,\n\n551\n00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:17.310\nessentially they have\nto be declared no good.\n\n552\n00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:20.220\nSo they have to be revoked,\nthat's the CRL process.\n\n553\n00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:22.090\nWe then re-issue them.\n\n554\n00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:25.840\nBut the rest of certificates around and\nlateral to them are not affected.\n\n555\n00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:26.350\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n556\n00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:29.106\nthis becomes a very important\npart of the process, absolutely.\n\n557\n00:26:29.106 --> 00:26:33.693\n&gt;&gt; Now, Adam, is it best practice for\nan organization like Microsoft or one of\n\n558\n00:26:33.693 --> 00:26:38.830\nthose you had mentioned to kind of bring\nthat root CA offline to keep it protected.\n\n559\n00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:43.170\nBecause of how integral and\nhow important it is to that hierarchy?\n\n560\n00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:45.380\nSo all root CAs, almost all, not all,\n\n561\n00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:49.520\nbecause some organizations don't take the\nroot CAs offline, they leave them online.\n\n562\n00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.210\nThey may self sign their own certificates,\n\n563\n00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:56.580\nmany small companies that use Microsoft\nand the Active Directory for instance.\n\n564\n00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:00.260\nNAD you have what's called ADCS,\nActive Directory Certificate Services and\n\n565\n00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:02.800\nuse self-sign initiative\ncertificates yourself.\n\n566\n00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:06.170\nYou have your own root CA,\nthe domain controllers become root CAs\n\n567\n00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:08.430\nwhen you add the certificate\nservices to them.\n\n568\n00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:11.610\nAnd you may not take them offline,\nyou just may leave them up and running.\n\n569\n00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:15.810\nBut they're inside the security perimeter,\nand they're protected by hopefully\n\n570\n00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:19.580\nmultiple layers of security or\ndefense, and defensive mechanisms.\n\n571\n00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:21.630\nBut the standard best practice,\n\n572\n00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:25.820\nespecially in commercial CA is\nto take the roots CAs offline\n\n573\n00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:29.510\nyou typically do them on a laptop or\nsome device with a removable hard drive.\n\n574\n00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:31.420\nYou pull the hard drive\nout of the machine,\n\n575\n00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:35.520\nyou put the hard drive in a vault and\nyou lock that up and store it there.\n\n576\n00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:38.840\nThat way the only way that security\nauthority is ever available\n\n577\n00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:40.990\nis when you mount that hard drive and\nput it back up.\n\n578\n00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:44.060\nThis is done today with virtual machines\nas well, you take the hard drive file,\n\n579\n00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:45.400\nyou store it somewhere so\n\n580\n00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:48.100\nyou gonna have to physically take\nthe hard drive out of a machine.\n\n581\n00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:52.650\nBut ultimately, yes, we would take\nthose CAs, root CAs, offline.\n\n582\n00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:55.980\nOnly bringing them online in\nstrictly controlled condition,\n\n583\n00:27:55.980 --> 00:28:00.400\nwhere we need to issue new certificates\nto additional subordinate CAs or\n\n584\n00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:03.980\nto reissue certificates because they're\nexpiring for the current subordinate CAs.\n\n585\n00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:07.470\nCuz certificates are issued for\na period of time, as we talked about.\n\n586\n00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:09.620\nIf you look at root certificates for\n\n587\n00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:13.590\nMicrosoft, you'll see those root\ncertificates are issued for 30, 40 years.\n\n588\n00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:15.030\nLike some crazy amount of time.\n\n589\n00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:15.770\n&gt;&gt; That is crazy.\n\n590\n00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:20.850\n&gt;&gt; Whereas, a subordinate CA certificate\nthat is issued to a user may be issued for\n\n591\n00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:23.670\na year, for that user to be able\nto validate their identity,\n\n592\n00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:26.020\ndigitally sign email,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n593\n00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:27.510\nSo there is a great disparity there\n\n594\n00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:28.580\na great change\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n595\n00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:31.180\n&gt;&gt; in the timing because we do\nnot want to have to reissue\n\n596\n00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:34.040\nsubordinate CA certificates\nvery often if we can avoid it.\n\n597\n00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.820\nBecause, every time we use that\nRoot CA there is a potential for\n\n598\n00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:39.310\ncompromise if somebody gets\nin the middle of that and\n\n599\n00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:42.200\nsomehow gets into stuff they\nare not supposed to see.\n\n600\n00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:46.860\nSo, subordinate CA's, Root CA's we\nhopefully have a better sense of that.\n\n601\n00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:50.230\nNow the RA which I mentioned may or\nmay not right here in the middle\n\n602\n00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:53.630\nBe something that you would see\nin all PKI implementations.\n\n603\n00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:54.880\nIt's optional, right?\n\n604\n00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.980\nYou don't necessarily need one,\nbut registration authority.\n\n605\n00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:02.820\nIt is used to proxy the certificate\nrequests on behalf of the user and\n\n606\n00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:03.910\nvalidate whether or\n\n607\n00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:08.000\nnot they are legitimate instead of\nhaving the user go directly to the CA.\n\n608\n00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.690\nWe go through the RA so the RA talks to\nthe supported CA on behalf of the user,\n\n609\n00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:16.960\nmaking it harder for that actor to be\nable to get directly to the certificate\n\n610\n00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.500\nauthority and potentially do harm.\n\n611\n00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:23.030\nAnd we can see that in the diagram because\nyou'll see the certificate authority\n\n612\n00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:27.560\nis over here, issuing the certificate,\nbut really should happen first, right?\n\n613\n00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:30.860\nThe person makes a request\nto get a certificate.\n\n614\n00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:34.240\nThat request goes to the RA,\nthe registration authority.\n\n615\n00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:38.270\nThat goes to the CA,\nwho has to validate whether or\n\n616\n00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:40.770\nnot that request is\ngoing to be legitimate.\n\n617\n00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:43.630\nIs the user a member of\nthe directory service?\n\n618\n00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:45.120\nAre they an authorized user?\n\n619\n00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:46.610\nAre they in good standing?\n\n620\n00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:47.490\nDo we like them?\n\n621\n00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:48.930\nHave they paid their bills?\n\n622\n00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:49.690\nAll that kind of stuff.\n\n623\n00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:51.460\nYeah, whatever the case maybe.\n\n624\n00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:54.670\nAnd then,\nif we find them to be valid, right?\n\n625\n00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:56.570\nOkay, issue the certificate.\n\n626\n00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:58.170\nThen the certificate's issued.\n\n627\n00:29:58.170 --> 00:30:00.430\nWe don't have a oops, no,\nno, okay, don't issue.\n\n628\n00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:03.840\nBut if we did, right, if you put a line\nthrough there, kind of like we have,\n\n629\n00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:04.410\nit's hard to see.\n\n630\n00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:07.830\nBut, let's say there was a line\nthrough there in theory, right?\n\n631\n00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:09.720\nThen, it would say, sorry, no good.\n\n632\n00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:11.240\nDon't issue the certificate.\n\n633\n00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.710\nThen this part right\nhere would never happen.\n\n634\n00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:16.070\nSo the RA is really the gatekeeper,\n\n635\n00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:19.920\nwhen we put one in, to stand between\nthe users and their requests for\n\n636\n00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:24.070\ncertificates and the certificate\nauthorities that issue certificates.\n\n637\n00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:28.950\nIt does all of the initial conversation\nand proxying on behalf of the user.\n\n638\n00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:34.410\nAnd then once the CA Is able to verify and\nvalidate the certificate\n\n639\n00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:37.790\nthen they can go ahead and say yeah,\nit already says it's good, we'll issue it.\n\n640\n00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:41.730\nBut the verification process involves\ngoing to the verification authority.\n\n641\n00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:45.740\nThat could be the LDAP provider, so\nthat may be a domain controller.\n\n642\n00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:50.100\nRemember in Windows all these roles\nessentially sit in one system.\n\n643\n00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:53.300\nAs the certificate server\ngenerically in Windows.\n\n644\n00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:56.690\nWe just put certificate services\non a domain controller, and\n\n645\n00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:58.610\nthat's where we see all these happening.\n\n646\n00:30:58.610 --> 00:31:02.300\nIt's just functionality how limits\nin services, that run in one box.\n\n647\n00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:05.130\n&gt;&gt; Do you deconstruct in\nthe intelligence via this diagram?\n\n648\n00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:08.800\n&gt;&gt; Right, but in certain implementations,\nin Linux based implementations for\n\n649\n00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.660\ninstance, and\nin commercial CAs that are not\n\n650\n00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:14.650\nbased just on Windows\n&gt;&gt; We actually see specific servers\n\n651\n00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:18.160\nassigned with these roles and\nthey perform just one piece of the puzzle.\n\n652\n00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:20.290\n&gt;&gt; And then you can get your\nHawaiian print clothing.\n\n653\n00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:24.590\n&gt;&gt; And then you can go to the store and\nbuy your tacky Hawaiian print clothing and\n\n654\n00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:28.820\nyou can get dressed for the beach luau\nthat we're having later on this afternoon,\n\n655\n00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:31.393\nfrom the merchant who has\nthe old style cash register.\n\n656\n00:31:31.393 --> 00:31:31.911\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There you go.\n\n657\n00:31:31.911 --> 00:31:34.080\n&gt;&gt; From the 1920s,\ncuz that's what we have there.\n\n658\n00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:37.460\nModern certificate technology for\nthe e-commerce front end.\n\n659\n00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:41.440\nBut the old fashioned clothing and\nthe old fashioned payment gateway, right.\n\n660\n00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:46.300\nSo that's what we mix here, the modern\nwith the old and retro look, so to speak.\n\n661\n00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:49.030\nSo we have all of our PKI items here.\n\n662\n00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:50.240\nJust wanted to show this to you.\n\n663\n00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:53.330\nLet's go back to our diagram here for\njust a second, or\n\n664\n00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:55.590\nrather our definitions if you will.\n\n665\n00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:57.390\nSorry I hit the wrong button there.\n\n666\n00:31:57.390 --> 00:31:58.514\nThat's what I meant to do.\n\n667\n00:31:58.514 --> 00:32:00.215\nRight idea but wrong minus sign.\n\n668\n00:32:00.215 --> 00:32:04.706\nSo you can see that when we use the\ncertificate authority We are gonna create,\n\n669\n00:32:04.706 --> 00:32:06.364\nthrough this idea of trust,\n\n670\n00:32:06.364 --> 00:32:10.760\nthis relationship where we can\nissue certificates hierarchically.\n\n671\n00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:13.030\nThe root CA only issues to subordinates.\n\n672\n00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:15.860\nSubordinates issue to users and\ncomputers on behalf of the root.\n\n673\n00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:21.720\nNow there are enterprise root CAs and\nthere are standalone root CAs.\n\n674\n00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:26.515\nAnd there are enterprise subordinate\nCAs and standalone subordinate CAs.\n\n675\n00:32:26.515 --> 00:32:30.540\nAn enterprise CA means that\nit is a certificate authority\n\n676\n00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:32.470\ntied to an LDAP provider.\n\n677\n00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:35.490\nIn other words it's a certificate\nauthority that has a domain controller\n\n678\n00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:37.540\nimplemented in the active directory.\n\n679\n00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:40.290\nThat is what we would\ncall an enterprise CA.\n\n680\n00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:44.320\nA standalone CA is a certificate\nauthority installed outside of\n\n681\n00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:45.610\nthe directory service.\n\n682\n00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:51.455\nIt's on a standalone server not connected\nto an LDAP provider, it stands alone.\n\n683\n00:32:51.455 --> 00:32:54.400\nIt's isolated in that respect\nif you think about it logically.\n\n684\n00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:59.300\nThat is what a standalone CA is, so\na root in subordinate CA's can be\n\n685\n00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:03.330\nof either enterprise or standalone type\ndepending on how they are implemented.\n\n686\n00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:06.760\nAs I said, in Windows we tend to\nput them on domain controllers,\n\n687\n00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:10.380\ninstall the ADCS service, and\neverything is just there.\n\n688\n00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:14.250\nIn Linux, Unix, and other systems\neven Windows in certain cases.\n\n689\n00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:18.409\nFrom a security stand point we will\nimplement certificate services to\n\n690\n00:33:18.409 --> 00:33:20.600\nintegrate into the LDAP directory.\n\n691\n00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:24.050\nBut in other times we'll implement\nthese standalone systems.\n\n692\n00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:26.650\nWhen we have to put them,\nfor instance, into a DMZ.\n\n693\n00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:28.680\nSo we want to be able to\nissue certificates, but\n\n694\n00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:31.630\nnot expose the back-end directory service,\nbut\n\n695\n00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:35.110\nstill provide certificates to\nsystems that have to get them.\n\n696\n00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:39.331\nWe may use standalone CAs, disassociated\nfrom that certificate, or rather,\n\n697\n00:33:39.331 --> 00:33:40.657\nfrom the LDAP provider.\n\n698\n00:33:40.657 --> 00:33:43.390\nSo, it just depends on how\nit's used to implement.\n\n699\n00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:45.760\n&gt;&gt; And there's a lot of different\nways you can implement them.\n\n700\n00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:48.000\nLike Adam was mentioning\nthere with our standalones.\n\n701\n00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.690\nAnd I think a lot of it has to\ndo with budget and company size.\n\n702\n00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:56.040\nBut, it looks like we're getting\nclose to time one this episode, so.\n\n703\n00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:58.720\n&gt;&gt; We are, but before we finish\nI just wanna make sure we see\n\n704\n00:33:58.720 --> 00:33:59.680\nthe definition of RA.\n\n705\n00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:02.400\nWe talked about it, I just wanna make\nsure we put it up on the screen so\n\n706\n00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.770\npeople don't wonder where it is and\nwhy we didn't define it.\n\n707\n00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:06.990\nCuz we do have it on the list,\nas you can see.\n\n708\n00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:08.560\nSo just below where we were,\n\n709\n00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:11.080\nI just was remiss in my scrolling\nwhile you were talking.\n\n710\n00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.460\nSo registration authority we\nwanted to find out as well.\n\n711\n00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:15.160\nAs you can see here, responsible for\n\n712\n00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:18.550\naccuracy of the information in the\ncertificate requests as we talked about.\n\n713\n00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:20.660\nAlso expect to perform user validation.\n\n714\n00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:23.420\nRemember, we may not see\nthe validation authority separate.\n\n715\n00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:27.830\nThis is typically all in one, so\nthe RA does the validation process.\n\n716\n00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:32.590\nAnd vets the user's provided information\nto make sure their certificate request is\n\n717\n00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:35.430\ngoing to be legitimate before\nwe issue the certificates.\n\n718\n00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:37.120\nJust want to make sure\nwe have that in there\n\n719\n00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:39.050\nas part of our conversation as we wrap up.\n\n720\n00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:40.900\n&gt;&gt; Sure, and\nit's not like we're finished here.\n\n721\n00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:43.725\nWe do have some additional\ninformation to cover.\n\n722\n00:34:43.725 --> 00:34:47.990\nSo stay tuned for, we're gonna be reaching\na part three at this point in time, so\n\n723\n00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:49.220\nstay tuned for that.\n\n724\n00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:51.810\nRemember, I'm your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n725\n00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:53.425\n&gt;&gt; I am Captain Cryptography.\n\n726\n00:34:53.425 --> 00:34:56.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] See you next\ntime here at ITProTV.\n\n727\n00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:59.125\n&gt;&gt; Take care everybody.\n\n728\n00:34:59.125 --> 00:35:04.895\n[MUSIC]\n\n729\n00:35:04.895 --> 00:35:06.920\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching IT Pro TV.\n\n",

00:00:12.496\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.496 --> 00:00:14.250\n&gt;&gt; From tier ECES series.\n\n5\n00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.400\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.890\nThis is actually a part three where we're\ncontinuing looking at different types\n\n7\n00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.070\nof cryptography definitions, and\n\n8\n00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.510\nwith us today in studios we have\nCaptain Cryptography himself.\n\n9\n00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.110\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n10\n00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.175\nThat's my new title?\n\n11\n00:00:29.175 --> 00:00:29.936\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know.\n\n12\n00:00:29.936 --> 00:00:33.169\n&gt;&gt; All right, so thank you very much,\nalways glad to sail into port and\n\n13\n00:00:33.169 --> 00:00:33.924\ntalk with you.\n\n14\n00:00:33.924 --> 00:00:36.511\nA little bit about cryptography,\nlet me continue our conversations,\n\n15\n00:00:36.511 --> 00:00:38.320\nwe're working through our vocabulary.\n\n16\n00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.570\nOur crypto-definitions as we have\ntitled the series of episodes.\n\n17\n00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.554\nRemind you as we did in the last one,\nif you haven't seen the prior two\n\n18\n00:00:45.554 --> 00:00:49.161\nconversations, wanna go back, take a look\nat them most likely it's gonna help you\n\n19\n00:00:49.161 --> 00:00:52.017\nhave the context and the flow for\nwhat we're talking about here.\n\n20\n00:00:52.017 --> 00:00:55.623\nThere's never a right or wrong order\nper se, to any of the material we go\n\n21\n00:00:55.623 --> 00:00:59.470\nthrough but in this particular case\nbecause we're laying out some ideas and\n\n22\n00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.210\nreally defining concepts,\nit's good foundational knowledge.\n\n23\n00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.446\nAnd you just want to make sure\nyou're keeping up with us so\n\n24\n00:01:05.446 --> 00:01:07.556\nyou know where we are where\nwe jump back into the list.\n\n25\n00:01:07.556 --> 00:01:10.355\nAnd you're not wondering hey why are they\ntalking about stuff that seems like it\n\n26\n00:01:10.355 --> 00:01:13.240\nwould be better talked about after\nyou talk about all that other stuff?\n\n27\n00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.390\nWell we aren't, but you haven't seen\npart one and two so make sure you take\n\n28\n00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.900\na look at episode one and two then\ncome on back and join us for this one.\n\n29\n00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.180\nWe're gonna jump back in pick up\nwhere we left off if we could please?\n\n30\n00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.870\nTake a look at our machine,\nput up our list,\n\n31\n00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.370\nwe left off having just finished\na rousing conversation about PKI.\n\n32\n00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.250\nIt was incredible and dynamic.\n\n33\n00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.372\nAnd it was all that and\na whole big bunch more.\n\n34\n00:01:36.372 --> 00:01:38.002\nSo do go back and take a look.\n\n35\n00:01:38.002 --> 00:01:42.132\nBut if you remember that, we left off\ntalking about the certificate authorities,\n\n36\n00:01:42.132 --> 00:01:46.203\nthe root, the subordinate, the enterprise,\nthe standalone, the RA, the VA,\n\n37\n00:01:46.203 --> 00:01:47.730\nwe went through all that.\n\n38\n00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.290\nThat took us up to and really sets us up\nto start talking about some terms that\n\n39\n00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.330\nwe've already actually defined.\n\n40\n00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.740\nWe're gonna jump through a bunch of\nthese real quick cuz we've already\n\n41\n00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:55.780\nspoken about them.\n\n42\n00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.980\nBut we've talked about plain text or\nclear text.\n\n43\n00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.580\nThat is the input traditionally as we\nstart to use our cryptosystem this is\n\n44\n00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.060\nthe information that we want to provide\nconfidentiality protections for,\n\n45\n00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.200\nto ensure that we are keeping\nthat data secret.\n\n46\n00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.169\nIt is the unencrypted version of the data\nthat we wanna protect, plain text or\n\n47\n00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:16.014\nclear text.\n\n48\n00:02:16.014 --> 00:02:20.680\nCypher text or cryptogram just multiple\nvocabulary terms that refer to\n\n49\n00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.065\nthe output of the cryptography process or\nthe crypto system.\n\n50\n00:02:25.065 --> 00:02:29.025\nWhen we put plain text through the crypto\nsystem by running it through the algorithm\n\n51\n00:02:29.025 --> 00:02:33.545\nwith the key in whatever\nprocesses specified.\n\n52\n00:02:33.545 --> 00:02:36.205\nThe output should be ciphertext or\ncryptogram.\n\n53\n00:02:36.205 --> 00:02:40.525\nThe encrypted version of the plain text\nis what we would say ciphertext is.\n\n54\n00:02:40.525 --> 00:02:41.613\nThe crypto system,\n\n55\n00:02:41.613 --> 00:02:45.205\nthe entire cryptographic operation\nis what is represented here.\n\n56\n00:02:45.205 --> 00:02:46.900\nThe algorithm, the key and\n\n57\n00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.744\nall key managements functions\nare part of the cryptosystem.\n\n58\n00:02:50.744 --> 00:02:52.396\nRemember, Mr. Kirchhoff?\n\n59\n00:02:52.396 --> 00:02:55.040\nWe talked about him in\nour prior two episodes.\n\n60\n00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.900\nHe is going to have told us,\nor did tell us,\n\n61\n00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.660\nthrough his principle, that the one thing\nwe cannot allow anybody to find out about\n\n62\n00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.970\nin the cryptosystem is the private key.\n\n63\n00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.559\nWe can expose the algorithm.\n\n64\n00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:08.500\nWe could expose the key\nmanagement functions,\n\n65\n00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.760\neverything else can be talked about, but\nthe private key must be kept secured.\n\n66\n00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.450\nGot to remember that.\n\n67\n00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.100\nEncryption and decryption.\n\n68\n00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.740\nEncryption is the act\nof taking plain text,\n\n69\n00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.070\nrunning it through the cryptosystem and\nproducing cipher text out the backend.\n\n70\n00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.850\nDecryption, that exact process in reverse,\ntaking ciphertext running it through\n\n71\n00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.220\nthe crypto system and ultimately producing\nplain text back out the other side.\n\n72\n00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.110\nSo the active encrypting or\ndecrypting is encryption or\n\n73\n00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.060\ndecryption, as we talk about.\n\n74\n00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.464\nThe key or cryptive variable\nwe've spoken about this as well.\n\n75\n00:03:41.464 --> 00:03:45.971\nThe key or the cryptovariable allows us,\njust moving this down a little bit and\n\n76\n00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:48.374\nthen of course moving it a little too far.\n\n77\n00:03:48.374 --> 00:03:53.085\nThat's what I get for scrolling instead\nof clicking there we go lets try\n\n78\n00:03:53.085 --> 00:03:56.397\nthis the right way the key or\nthe cryptovariable.\n\n79\n00:03:56.397 --> 00:03:57.877\nHey, I'm really good at cryptography.\n\n80\n00:03:57.877 --> 00:03:59.535\nI suck at using Microsoft Word.\n\n81\n00:03:59.535 --> 00:04:01.293\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So just so you know.\n\n82\n00:04:01.293 --> 00:04:02.580\nBut I'm not Captain Word.\n\n83\n00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.640\nI'm Captain Cryptography.\n\n84\n00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.562\nSo you would expect that.\n\n85\n00:04:04.562 --> 00:04:05.265\nSo there you go.\n\n86\n00:04:05.265 --> 00:04:06.519\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; But we do have training on how\n\n87\n00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:07.701\nto use Microsoft Word, do we not?\n\n88\n00:04:07.701 --> 00:04:09.302\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know of\na place that does that.\n\n89\n00:04:09.302 --> 00:04:11.270\n&gt;&gt; I know several places that do that.\n\n90\n00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:12.890\nSo I should probably go take a class.\n\n91\n00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.690\nAll right, so key or cryptovariable.\n\n92\n00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:15.440\nWe've talked about this.\n\n93\n00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.780\nThis is the input that controls the\noperation of the cryptographic algorithm.\n\n94\n00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.500\nIn plain English, it's the variable\nthat we never wanna show the bad actor.\n\n95\n00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.970\nThe private key is the one we keep secret.\n\n96\n00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.093\nRemember, the private-public key pair\nwhen we're talking about asymmetric\n\n97\n00:04:29.093 --> 00:04:29.961\ncryptography.\n\n98\n00:04:29.961 --> 00:04:33.735\nPublic-private key or all keys or\nwhatever else we came up with.\n\n99\n00:04:33.735 --> 00:04:35.876\nIt's the public key that we will expose.\n\n100\n00:04:35.876 --> 00:04:37.844\nIt's the private key\nthat we will keep secure.\n\n101\n00:04:37.844 --> 00:04:42.360\nIn symmetric or single key or same key\nencryption, it's private key only.\n\n102\n00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.860\nWe keep that key secure,\n\n103\n00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.360\nthat is what was talking about,\nthat is the private key we referred to.\n\n104\n00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.110\nIt is also,\nalthough not as commonly referred to, but\n\n105\n00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.040\nit's sometimes referred\nto as a cryptovariable.\n\n106\n00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.445\nSo you will often hear that in the more\nmathematical abstracted conversations\n\n107\n00:04:56.445 --> 00:04:57.785\naround cryptography.\n\n108\n00:04:57.785 --> 00:05:01.275\nThat's just a polite way of saying the\nreally geeky guys that get together and\n\n109\n00:05:01.275 --> 00:05:03.812\ngirls and talk about cryptography\nwhen they talk shop.\n\n110\n00:05:03.812 --> 00:05:07.631\nBut when they talk mathematics and\nthe actual underlying architecture and\n\n111\n00:05:07.631 --> 00:05:10.358\nreal hardcore heavy duty\nanalysis of cryptography,\n\n112\n00:05:10.358 --> 00:05:14.550\nwe refer to it as a crypto-variable in\nthe formulas, and that just means the key.\n\n113\n00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:15.628\nThat's just all we mean.\n\n114\n00:05:15.628 --> 00:05:20.720\nNon-repudiation talked about this when\nwe talked about digital signing right?\n\n115\n00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.870\nThe idea of not being able to say, or\n\n116\n00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.430\nnot being able to claim that\nyou did something, right?\n\n117\n00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.970\nSo the idea of non-repudiation.\n\n118\n00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.290\nI can't say it wasn't me.\n\n119\n00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.150\nYou've got authoritative proof it\nwas because I used my private key\n\n120\n00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.280\nin order to sign.\n\n121\n00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.900\nNow I stressed this when we talked\nabout this in the last episode.\n\n122\n00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.320\nI want to go back to this idea for\n\n123\n00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.080\na moment here and\nmake sure you're comfortable with this.\n\n124\n00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.130\nThe idea being that if you hear something\nmore than once hopefully it will stick and\n\n125\n00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:44.300\nyou will remember it.\n\n126\n00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.810\nSo when we think about digital signing and\nwe think about using our private key to\n\n127\n00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.980\nrepresent our identity and\nauthoritatively prove\n\n128\n00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:58.380\nthrough non-repudiation a proof of origin\nthat supposedly we sent the message.\n\n129\n00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.020\nAs well as through digitally\nsigning to validate\n\n130\n00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.710\nwith integrity that\nthe message was not modified.\n\n131\n00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.347\nWhen we think about non-repudiation\nwhat I have to correct my students and\n\n132\n00:06:07.347 --> 00:06:10.880\nmy customers about all the time when\nwe talk about this is the following.\n\n133\n00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.285\nThey'll say, okay well Adam,\nI'm digital signing so\n\n134\n00:06:13.285 --> 00:06:14.878\nthat means you have to know it's me.\n\n135\n00:06:14.878 --> 00:06:18.538\nYou always have to accept that it's\nme cuz I'm using my private key.\n\n136\n00:06:18.538 --> 00:06:20.414\nIf I keep my private key\nsecured it's always me, right?\n\n137\n00:06:20.414 --> 00:06:23.408\nBeyond any reasonable doubt,\nthat's what you said.\n\n138\n00:06:23.408 --> 00:06:28.278\nNot exactly what I said, what I said\nwas that we assume that that is\n\n139\n00:06:28.278 --> 00:06:32.015\na allowable and\ntherefore acceptable standard.\n\n140\n00:06:32.015 --> 00:06:37.521\nThere is reasonable doubt, and I stressed\nthe word reasonable when we talked about\n\n141\n00:06:37.521 --> 00:06:43.041\nit because what non-repudiation really\ntells us is that our private key was used.\n\n142\n00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:47.782\nIt doesn't tell us whose hands were on\nthe keyboard and who actually sat down and\n\n143\n00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:49.290\nsent the message.\n\n144\n00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:50.160\nIn other words,\n\n145\n00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.940\nwithout multi-factor authentication\nbeing added to the mix on the back end.\n\n146\n00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.790\nWithout us having overlapping, mutually\nreinforcing layers of controls and\n\n147\n00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.050\ncounter measure.\n\n148\n00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.320\nDefense in depth, as we often say.\n\n149\n00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:08.461\nSo that we know that if Cherokee was\nthe one was gonna send the message.\n\n150\n00:07:08.461 --> 00:07:12.683\nAnd she sends it and I get it, and\nthe only thing I can rely on is that I\n\n151\n00:07:12.683 --> 00:07:16.619\nvalidate her private key,\nwith her public private key pair.\n\n152\n00:07:16.619 --> 00:07:19.751\nAnd I see that it was her key\nthat was used I know her key,\n\n153\n00:07:19.751 --> 00:07:21.670\nher private key was used to sign.\n\n154\n00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:23.650\nI don't know if she\nactually wrote the message,\n\n155\n00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:26.930\nshe may have been standing at\nthe keyboard and actually did it.\n\n156\n00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.300\nShe may have used voice control and\nasked Siri to do it,\n\n157\n00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.990\nor Cortana, or whoever, right?\n\n158\n00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:35.935\nSo maybe in a mythical nameless,\nfaceless, voiceless entity who did it?\n\n159\n00:07:35.935 --> 00:07:38.892\nOr it could have been somebody\nimpersonating Cherokee,\n\n160\n00:07:38.892 --> 00:07:42.722\nbecause maybe Cherokee walked away\nfrom her machine, forgot to lock it.\n\n161\n00:07:42.722 --> 00:07:46.853\nOr maybe she did lock it, but maybe we\nbroke in and without her knowledge,\n\n162\n00:07:46.853 --> 00:07:50.000\nwe used her email program\nwhich stores her private key.\n\n163\n00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.489\nSo, we could have essentially\ngotten her key and used it.\n\n164\n00:07:53.489 --> 00:07:57.332\nBut it may have been me masquerading\nas Cherokee, sending that message and\n\n165\n00:07:57.332 --> 00:07:58.802\nyou never would have known.\n\n166\n00:07:58.802 --> 00:08:03.891\nSo, non-repudiation does not, in and\nof itself, by itself, authoritatively\n\n167\n00:08:03.891 --> 00:08:08.700\nbeyond any reasonable doubt,\nestablish the identity of the sender.\n\n168\n00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.950\nBut it does give us\nthe indication that it is likely\n\n169\n00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.770\nthe person whose private key was used.\n\n170\n00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:17.370\nBut if we want to go beyond that\nreasonable doubt barrier, we have to add\n\n171\n00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:21.680\nmultiple layers of authentication We\nhave to add in biometrics most likely.\n\n172\n00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:26.540\nSo, wouldn't be enough for me to just walk\nup to Cherokee's laptop when she goes to\n\n173\n00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:30.370\ntake a break and be able to just move\nthe mouse or the trackpad or whatever.\n\n174\n00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:34.500\nIt comes up I log in and I'm automatically\nin, I may have to provide a fingerprint\n\n175\n00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:38.200\nscan, a retina scan, a voice scan,\nwhatever I may add in.\n\n176\n00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:43.550\nSome sort of proof that it's really\nCherokee and not me as a secondary or\n\n177\n00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:47.550\nthird or tertiary way of combining\naccess controls together,\n\n178\n00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:51.660\nand we go from single to dual\nto multi factor authentication.\n\n179\n00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:56.900\nAs we go we become more secure,\nthere's less likelihood of spoofing.\n\n180\n00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.850\nOr vulnerabilities that could\nbe introduced into the system\n\n181\n00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:01.760\nthat can lead to masquerade or compromise.\n\n182\n00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.880\nSo, I just wanna make sure you're clear\non the concept of non-repudiation,\n\n183\n00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.870\nwhat it does and does not imply.\n\n184\n00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:11.550\nWe tend to just take it at face value and\nwe lump it together and say.\n\n185\n00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.305\nYeah, that means that Cherokee sent it.\n\n186\n00:09:13.305 --> 00:09:15.460\nNon-repudiation, yeah,\nshe had to have sent it.\n\n187\n00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:16.320\nNo problem.\n\n188\n00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.260\nNo, it really means her key,\nher private key was used.\n\n189\n00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.810\nBut anybody could have sent\nthe message if they got her key,\n\n190\n00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:24.750\nunless we add those additional factors.\n\n191\n00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:28.820\nAnd it's a very important distinction\nbecause people tend to take these things\n\n192\n00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:33.480\nand rely more on them than we should\nbecause we don't necessarily validate\n\n193\n00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:37.220\nthe counter measures of controls on the\nback end, we just take them for granted.\n\n194\n00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:40.760\nAnd we may be trusting in something\nthat actually is not trustworthy, and\n\n195\n00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:41.740\nthat could be a really big issue.\n\n196\n00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:45.360\n&gt;&gt; And it's nice we see a lot of companies\nthat are implementing multi-factor, or\n\n197\n00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.400\nat least dual factor\nauthentication nowadays.\n\n198\n00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:47.990\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n\n199\n00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:49.680\nYeah, Google is faced because-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n200\n00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.360\n&gt;&gt; All the big ones are either\nthrough external USB keys or\n\n201\n00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.510\nvarious ways of doing it, a lot of really\ngood stuff happening in the industry out\n\n202\n00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:57.990\nthere, really exciting\ntime to be doing this.\n\n203\n00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:01.590\nA lot of additional capabilities\nthat as security practitioners,\n\n204\n00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:06.200\nIT professionals, as potentially certified\nencryption specialists or whatever you\n\n205\n00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.950\nmay ultimately be or wanna be right\nthat we could take advantage of right?\n\n206\n00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:12.460\nSo really,\nexciting time to be doing this but\n\n207\n00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:14.530\nthere's always new techniques for every.\n\n208\n00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.580\nImplementation of a counter measure or\ncontrol we put in place that we think\n\n209\n00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.580\nwill safeguard and\nmake us happier to be doing this.\n\n210\n00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:22.650\nWe find out unfortunately,\nthe hard way, typically,\n\n211\n00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:25.820\nright, that there are a lot of\nthings out there that can violate or\n\n212\n00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:28.480\nbreak the trust and\nthe faith we put in those systems.\n\n213\n00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.350\nAnd we've just gotta always be skeptical.\n\n214\n00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:34.170\nI often tell my students, tell my\ncustomers trust, but verify, right?\n\n215\n00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:37.620\nCuz if you trust but\nverify you're less likely to get caught\n\n216\n00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.930\ntrusting something that may actually\nnot be what it seems to be.\n\n217\n00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:42.670\nSo it's important to do that or\na least, be aware of that.\n\n218\n00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:47.660\nWe talk about algorithms, these are the\nmathematical formulas that are used\n\n219\n00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:51.310\nto be able to actually or the mathematical\nprocess and formula that is used.\n\n220\n00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:52.730\n&gt;&gt; This is where I cry.\n\n221\n00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:53.400\nWhere you cry.\n\n222\n00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because you don't like the word math or\n\n223\n00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:56.410\nbecause-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n224\n00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:58.190\n&gt;&gt; It's hard or-\n&gt;&gt; It's hard,\n\n225\n00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:01.350\nsometimes these algorithms\nare just mind boggling.\n\n226\n00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:03.930\n&gt;&gt; They can be very difficult,\nthey are hard, but\n\n227\n00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:08.400\nthe good news about them is,\nagain we talked about this part.\n\n228\n00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.250\nThat a lot of these algorithms\nare now being implemented through\n\n229\n00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:11.970\nsoftware as you know.\n\n230\n00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:12.580\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n231\n00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.290\nso application-based in other words, or\n\n232\n00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:16.220\nhardware based where they're\n&gt;&gt; Is a control module, or\n\n233\n00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.210\nsomething in the system.\n\n234\n00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:22.210\nAnd you're using it, but you're not\nnecessarily having to do implement it\n\n235\n00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:26.170\nyourself, you're just simply having to\nensure that it's being used correctly.\n\n236\n00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:28.150\nSo, it is hard, and\nI don't wanna discount that.\n\n237\n00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:31.070\nBut the good news is you're not actually\nhaving to sit down with paper, pencil and\n\n238\n00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:34.350\nslide rule, or abacus, right,\nif you're really hardcore.\n\n239\n00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:34.954\n&gt;&gt; That would be, yes.\n\n240\n00:11:34.954 --> 00:11:36.360\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And having to do this\n\n241\n00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.080\n&gt;&gt; You actually are now able to\n\n242\n00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.450\nautomate a lot of this process, right.\n\n243\n00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.200\nSo that part is good, so, but\nthese are the mathematical formulas,\n\n244\n00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.840\nessentially, the algorithms\nthat are being used.\n\n245\n00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.340\nSo, when Cherokee mentioned one\nof our prior episodes, DES,\n\n246\n00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:53.610\nthe data encryption standard, or AES,\nor Blowfish, or Twofish, or RSA, or\n\n247\n00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:59.150\nECC, elliptic curve cryptography or\n\n248\n00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:01.810\nany of the various algorithms we\nmay have mentioned or will mention.\n\n249\n00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:04.720\nTiger, HAVAL, ElGamal,\nDiffie Hellman, you name it.\n\n250\n00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.070\nThere's hundreds of them out there, right?\n\n251\n00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:12.040\nWhatever they are, any or all of them are\ngoing to be some form of a mathematical\n\n252\n00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.730\nformula, essentially, that is used to\nimplement this kind of a function.\n\n253\n00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:19.590\nBut they are software based, implemented\nthrough software and hardware today and\n\n254\n00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:22.040\nthey are tough, but you know\n&gt;&gt; Rest assured,\n\n255\n00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.260\nthey only get tougher with time.\n\n256\n00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:24.335\nSo that's what you need to know.\n\n257\n00:12:24.335 --> 00:12:25.343\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] good.\n\n258\n00:12:25.343 --> 00:12:28.000\n&gt;&gt; They never get easier, cuz if they\nget easier, we can't use them any more.\n\n259\n00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.810\nThat's why we gotta get rid\nof them every so often and\n\n260\n00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:31.200\nget new ones that are more difficult.\n\n261\n00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.355\nThat's why DES was retired.\n\n262\n00:12:32.355 --> 00:12:34.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Triple DES because it was found to be\n\n263\n00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:35.800\npotentially compromisable.\n\n264\n00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:36.820\nTechnology had gotten so\n\n265\n00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:40.490\ngood that computing power was now\nable to break Triple DES encryption.\n\n266\n00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:44.070\nPotentially, and as a result we could\nno longer use it securely, at least for\n\n267\n00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:48.200\nsecure, confidential, highly confidential,\ntop secret information, the government and\n\n268\n00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:48.990\nthe military.\n\n269\n00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:52.890\nAnd so, several years ago we switched\nover from triple DES into AES which is\n\n270\n00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:53.780\na stronger.\n\n271\n00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.750\nA variable bit strength algorithm\nthat uses a different approach and\n\n272\n00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:59.970\nwe'll talk more about that at some point\nin one of our future, upcoming episodes.\n\n273\n00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:01.210\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; I invite you to come back and\n\n274\n00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:01.950\ntake a look at that.\n\n275\n00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:04.090\nCherokee's actually gonna\nvolunteer to present that-\n\n276\n00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:05.190\n&gt;&gt; I love talking about that.\n\n277\n00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:06.455\n&gt;&gt; She's gonna do the chart-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n278\n00:13:06.455 --> 00:13:07.083\n&gt;&gt; And she's gonna walk\n\n279\n00:13:07.083 --> 00:13:07.922\nyou through how the bits work.\n\n280\n00:13:07.922 --> 00:13:08.899\n&gt;&gt; Except for the algorithm portion,\n\n281\n00:13:08.899 --> 00:13:09.930\nall I'll do is [INAUDIBLE]-\n&gt;&gt; But no,\n\n282\n00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:11.235\nthat's the part you're gonna do cuz-\n\n283\n00:13:11.235 --> 00:13:12.051\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n284\n00:13:12.051 --> 00:13:13.051\n&gt;&gt; That's the hard way.\n\n285\n00:13:13.051 --> 00:13:14.501\nAll the other stuff is easy.\n\n286\n00:13:14.501 --> 00:13:15.981\nYou got to stand up there\n\n287\n00:13:15.981 --> 00:13:19.571\njust talk about stuff.\nIt's the hard stuff that you got to do.\n\n288\n00:13:19.571 --> 00:13:21.011\nYou want to do it\n\n289\n00:13:21.011 --> 00:13:23.031\nyou got to do the whole thing, right?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n290\n00:13:23.031 --> 00:13:24.991\n&gt;&gt; Right, we're going to talk about that,\n\n291\n00:13:24.991 --> 00:13:26.250\nI promised you.\n\n292\n00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:32.190\nCryptology, a study of\nthe technique of attempting\n\n293\n00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:36.220\nto defeat crypto systems,\nnot as somebody once tried to tell me.\n\n294\n00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:39.790\nCryptanalysis and Cryptology,\nthey got them confused.\n\n295\n00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:43.390\nNumber one, told me cryptology was\nthe study of ancient Egyptian crypts,\n\n296\n00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:44.605\nthat's not what it is.\n\n297\n00:13:44.605 --> 00:13:47.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz ancient Egyptians\n\n298\n00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:49.790\ndidn't have crypts\n&gt;&gt; They actually had tombs\n\n299\n00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:50.860\nwhere they buried their people.\n\n300\n00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:51.940\nCrypt is a generic term.\n\n301\n00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:54.980\nBut we don't study crypts in cryptology.\n\n302\n00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.220\nBut the idea is,\ncryptanalysis is the study,\n\n303\n00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:01.020\nas you can see,\nof ways to break crypto systems, right?\n\n304\n00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.610\nSo you and I were chatting a little\nbit between the sessions about this.\n\n305\n00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:07.270\nIt's the idea of cryptanalysis that is\nthe hardcore study of how we defeat\n\n306\n00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:08.260\ncrypto systems.\n\n307\n00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:12.620\n&gt;&gt; Whereas cryptology is the actual\nscience that deals with how we implement\n\n308\n00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:16.350\ncryptographic protections to\nensure secure communications.\n\n309\n00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:19.700\nSo, it's just understanding\nthe difference in the definitions there.\n\n310\n00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:23.430\nBut cryptology, as well as crypt analysis,\n\n311\n00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:25.490\njust wanna make sure we're\ncomfortable with those.\n\n312\n00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:27.410\nLet me just scroll down here a little bit.\n\n313\n00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:28.310\nWe have collision.\n\n314\n00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:32.610\nThis is where you see half-functions\ngenerate the same output for\n\n315\n00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:33.350\ndifferent inputs.\n\n316\n00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:37.060\nRemember we talked about, the very\nbeginning, the very first episode we did,\n\n317\n00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:38.530\nit seems like so many-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n318\n00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:40.970\n&gt;&gt; So many, many episodes ago.\n\n319\n00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:43.200\nBut we talked about key clustering,\n\n320\n00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.370\none of the very first vocabulary terms\nthat we talked about on our list and\n\n321\n00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:49.270\nremind you to take a look at the show\nnotes, download this entire list.\n\n322\n00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:51.660\nCuz we're providing it to\nyou as a Word document.\n\n323\n00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:54.010\nYou've got all the definitions that\nwe're going through on the screen here.\n\n324\n00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:57.730\nWe're talking about them, encourage you as\nwe did in one of the prior episodes to use\n\n325\n00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:59.910\nthis as a skeleton to start\nmaking your study notes from.\n\n326\n00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:03.550\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Maybe do some flashcards, right?\n\n327\n00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:05.980\nAnd maybe make those, and\nperhaps even create your own, or\n\n328\n00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.240\ndo it online, or whatever.\n\n329\n00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.810\nBut use that, and\nif you go back at the top of the list,\n\n330\n00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:12.390\nyou will see\n&gt;&gt; Key clustering was one of the very\n\n331\n00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:13.670\nfirst terms we talked about.\n\n332\n00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:16.730\nSo this is the idea of key clustering\nessentially from a different perspective.\n\n333\n00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:19.470\nWhen we're doing hash\nfunctions as opposed to\n\n334\n00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:21.470\nencrypting we're talking about collisions.\n\n335\n00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:26.040\nAnd remember, anything that creates\nsameness, anything that creates a pattern,\n\n336\n00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:29.590\nanything that creates frequency\nthat can be analyzed and\n\n337\n00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:32.920\nshown to be repetitious is bad.\n\n338\n00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.950\nWe don't wanna repeat\nanything when we encrypt.\n\n339\n00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:39.760\nBecause if we do, chances are good that if\nthat actor is paying attention and they\n\n340\n00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.610\nfind it, it's gonna expose a weakness that\nthey can use to compromise the system.\n\n341\n00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:47.408\nSo collisions, key clusters,\nany kind of sameness or repetition,\n\n342\n00:15:47.408 --> 00:15:48.525\nwanna get rid of it.\n\n343\n00:15:48.525 --> 00:15:51.298\nIf we can do that,\nwe're much more likely to be secure,\n\n344\n00:15:51.298 --> 00:15:53.842\nif we can't we're much\nmore likely to get hacked.\n\n345\n00:15:53.842 --> 00:15:56.465\nThat's the standing rule\nthat you wanna understand.\n\n346\n00:15:56.465 --> 00:15:57.739\nTo that end key space and\n\n347\n00:15:57.739 --> 00:16:01.720\nwork factor you heard me talk about\nthese in some of the other episodes.\n\n348\n00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:05.626\nBut not formally define them I mentioned\nwith regards to the quick start we talked\n\n349\n00:16:05.626 --> 00:16:09.141\nabout WEP, and how WEP has broken\nessentially because of the problems,\n\n350\n00:16:09.141 --> 00:16:10.560\n&gt;&gt; Highly non-random?\n\n351\n00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.520\n&gt;&gt; Well, the impact there was that\nit was highly non random, but\n\n352\n00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:19.790\nconcepts of key space work factor in IV\n&gt;&gt; Initialization vector are the building\n\n353\n00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:20.700\nblocks for all that right?\n\n354\n00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.550\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; The non random part is the way we\n\n355\n00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:24.770\nimplement and\nthe fact that we didn't do it correctly.\n\n356\n00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:29.335\nThe key space is the total number\npossible of all keys in the algorithm or\n\n357\n00:16:29.335 --> 00:16:31.781\nsecurity measure that is being used.\n\n358\n00:16:31.781 --> 00:16:36.970\nSo if I say my key space\nis ten to the 128th power.\n\n359\n00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:39.010\nTen with 128 zeros after it,\n\n360\n00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:43.490\nthat's the total number of keys that are\npotentially are available for me to use.\n\n361\n00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:45.820\nI'm gonna reach into that pool and\n\n362\n00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:50.050\nI'm gonna grab a key randomly,\nhighly random hopefully.\n\n363\n00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:55.249\nAnd as a result of that I'm going to\nuse that key to encrypt If I do that,\n\n364\n00:16:55.249 --> 00:16:56.936\nwhat are the chances?\n\n365\n00:16:56.936 --> 00:17:00.321\nI would ask myself as a security\npractitioner, as a ECES and\n\n366\n00:17:00.321 --> 00:17:03.560\na EC Council Certified\nEncryption Specialist.\n\n367\n00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.960\nOr a super duper encryption person, right?\n\n368\n00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.540\nI would say Captain Encryption,\nbut that's me.\n\n369\n00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You can't be me cuz I'm me, so\n\n370\n00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:13.480\nyou have to be Lieutenant Encryption,\nor Ensign Encryption.\n\n371\n00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.650\n&gt;&gt; Mate.\n&gt;&gt; Just can't be Captain.\n\n372\n00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:16.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Mate, Encryption Mate, right?\n\n373\n00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:17.880\nThat's like coffee mate but\nfor encryption.\n\n374\n00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.970\nBut you can't be captain encryption\ncuz that's already taken.\n\n375\n00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:26.200\nSo I have go to check my Gmail address\nnow, captainencryption@gmail.com.\n\n376\n00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:30.370\nSo the idea would be that with the key\nspace if I reach in there and randomly\n\n377\n00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:36.130\nchoose one of those keys out of the whole\namount it would be so infinitesimally.\n\n378\n00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:40.700\nUnlikely in the sense that the pool is so\nbig that the bad actor could reach in and\n\n379\n00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.420\ngrab that same key,\neven repeatedly reaching and\n\n380\n00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:46.570\ntrying to grab that key would be\nhighly unlikely they would get it.\n\n381\n00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:50.160\nSo the larger the key space\nthe less likely it is that we can\n\n382\n00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.200\nfind the key through brute force or\nother mechanisms.\n\n383\n00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.600\nUnless we either get incredibly lucky or\nwe're told what the key is.\n\n384\n00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:00.550\nNow let's bring in our standard,\nonce an episode movie reference, and\n\n385\n00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:01.580\nlet's see if you know this one.\n\n386\n00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.260\n&gt;&gt; Great, I'm gonna fail again.\n\n387\n00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.610\n&gt;&gt; No, you're gonna get this one\ncuz you've probably have seen this.\n\n388\n00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:08.080\nSo are you a Harry Potter fan?\n\n389\n00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:08.955\n&gt;&gt; I've watched the movies.\n\n390\n00:18:08.955 --> 00:18:11.400\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so, you've watched the movies.\n\n391\n00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.440\nThat's all we ask of you\nis that you watch movies.\n\n392\n00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.210\nSo if you've watched the movie.\n\n393\n00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:20.930\nYou remember the movie where Harry has\nto break into the Chamber of Secrets?\n\n394\n00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:24.720\nAnd so one of the levels he has to go\nthrough after they play Wizard's Chess,\n\n395\n00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.290\nhe has to go through and\nget the key to open the door?\n\n396\n00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:29.220\nRight, you remember the flying\nkeys with the wings?\n\n397\n00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:29.820\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n398\n00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:31.220\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so think about that.\n\n399\n00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:34.170\nWell, you're looking at me like you've\nno clue what I'm talking about.\n\n400\n00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:35.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's bits and pieces, Adam.\n\n401\n00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:36.620\nI'm piecing it together here.\n\n402\n00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:39.460\n&gt;&gt; All right, so if you think about\nthe flying keys in the Chamber of Secrets\n\n403\n00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:41.950\nwhere he goes and he has to grab,\nhe goes up on the broom.\n\n404\n00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:44.210\nRemember he's flying around,\ngets the key, right?\n\n405\n00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:46.800\nThe one with kind of the off balance wing,\nright?\n\n406\n00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:51.360\nAnd he gets the key, opens the door and\nthen all the other keys are like, knives,\n\n407\n00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.790\nthey fly at the door,\nright, like killer keys.\n\n408\n00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:57.470\nRight so if that was our key pool,\nif that was essentially our key space,\n\n409\n00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:58.980\nall the keys flying around.\n\n410\n00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:03.350\nHarry had to go in and find the key\nthat would open the door literally.\n\n411\n00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:05.190\nAnd so the key space was big.\n\n412\n00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:08.370\nThere were a lot of keys in the cave but\nthere obviously weren't enough.\n\n413\n00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:09.990\nBecause he was able to find the key.\n\n414\n00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:12.140\nSo the key space wasn't big\nenough in that example.\n\n415\n00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:13.400\n&gt;&gt; Too random.\nOr not enough.\n\n416\n00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.040\n&gt;&gt; Not random enough.\n\n417\n00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:14.705\n&gt;&gt; Not random enough.\n\n418\n00:19:14.705 --> 00:19:18.680\n&gt;&gt; I2f it was too random the key space\nwould have been big enough that he\n\n419\n00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:19.900\nwould not have found the key.\n\n420\n00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:24.150\nCuz if you remember, Hermione, and\nwhat is the other one's name, the boy.\n\n421\n00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:25.030\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n422\n00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:25.965\n&gt;&gt; Hermione's boy friend.\n\n423\n00:19:25.965 --> 00:19:28.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can see his face.\n\n424\n00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.660\nI can't remember his name.\n\n425\n00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:32.920\nAnyway, and I didn't read the books,\nand I have not seen most of the movies,\n\n426\n00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.310\nbut my wife loves Harry Potter.\n\n427\n00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:36.770\nSo, I get all the stories.\n\n428\n00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:39.870\nI can't remember his name,\nbut Hermione's boyfriend.\n\n429\n00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:43.520\nAnyway, he, both of them say well we don't\nknow which key it is, how can we tell?\n\n430\n00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.880\nHarry figures it out, cuz he sees the one\nlimping along with the broken wing Right.\n\n431\n00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.270\nTrust me, this stuff actually\nworks in the real world.\n\n432\n00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:51.710\nYou just need to watch more movies,\nthat's the problem.\n\n433\n00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:53.110\nAll right, so go back and\nwatch that tonight.\n\n434\n00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:54.010\nYou'll se what I'm talking about.\n\n435\n00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:55.760\nSo, that's the key space concept.\n\n436\n00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.240\nThe idea that the pool has to be really\nbig, has to be sufficiently random.\n\n437\n00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:03.140\nWe need a larger number of keys to\nprevent us from finding it, right,\n\n438\n00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.480\nbecause we don't wanna reaching and\ngrabbing, or the bad actor,\n\n439\n00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.250\nI should say, reaching and grabbing it.\n\n440\n00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:10.740\nNow, work factor, the time in that for\nrequired to break a protective measure.\n\n441\n00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:14.640\nWork factor is measure of the amount of\ntime it will take to break the crypto\n\n442\n00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.210\nsystem but\nit's done in years typically, right.\n\n443\n00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:21.530\nBecause if the crypto system is strong,\nit will take, and not just a year,\n\n444\n00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:24.250\nwe're talking 10 to\nthe 100th power years or\n\n445\n00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:27.730\nsomething crazy like that in\na very strong crypto system.\n\n446\n00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:30.330\nVery well built,\nwell implemented crypto system.\n\n447\n00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:34.230\nIt's gonna be very high work factor is\nwhat we say, or long amount of time.\n\n448\n00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:39.540\nThe rule of thumb is the larger\nthe keyspace, the bigger the pool of keys,\n\n449\n00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:43.230\nthe higher the work factor, the longer the\ntime it takes to break the cryptosystem.\n\n450\n00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:45.420\n&gt;&gt; Because not everyone has\nmagic like Harry Potter.\n\n451\n00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:48.090\n&gt;&gt; Not everyone has magic like\nHarry Potter, that's the explanation.\n\n452\n00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:49.380\n&gt;&gt; That's what I took\naway from that [LAUGH].\n\n453\n00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:52.120\n&gt;&gt; That's the explanation\nwe give to the nice people\n\n454\n00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.320\nthat are listening to us right now.\n\n455\n00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:58.820\nPay no attention to the woman behind the\ncurtain offscreen that you do not seek.\n\n456\n00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:01.350\nNo, it is essentially like that.\n\n457\n00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:04.230\nBut let's translate that back a little\nbit more into the real world.\n\n458\n00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:08.410\nSo what we're thinking of is that\nbecause the key space is so big, so\n\n459\n00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:13.010\nmany keys, that it takes a very long\namount of time to try every key,\n\n460\n00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:14.770\nlooking at all the wrong\nones to find the right ones.\n\n461\n00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:18.110\n&gt;&gt; Which equates to computing,\nor processing power, right?\n\n462\n00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:19.150\n&gt;&gt; It's a derivative of that.\n\n463\n00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:19.710\nBut ultimately,\n\n464\n00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:24.160\nthe way we figure out the key space being\nbigger equals a longer work factor.\n\n465\n00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.130\nMore keys to try takes more time.\n\n466\n00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:28.590\nSo the larger the key space,\nthe longer the work factor.\n\n467\n00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:30.910\nWe can cut that down, trim that.\n\n468\n00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:32.200\n&gt;&gt; Not the number of keys, but\n\n469\n00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.580\ncut down the work space by adding either\nindividuals to the mix having more people\n\n470\n00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:41.480\ntry keys or adding computers that\ncan do a lot of keys very fast.\n\n471\n00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:45.340\nSo the better the computing power and the\nmore computers you can bring to the table.\n\n472\n00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:48.210\nThe shorter the work time will be or\nthe work factor will be,\n\n473\n00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:51.670\nbecause we can cut that down, because\nmore keys are being tried per second.\n\n474\n00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:54.690\nSo bad Harry, he can create a botnet and\n\n475\n00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:57.370\nthen that will help him\nfind his key faster.\n\n476\n00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:58.300\n&gt;&gt; Bad Harry?\n\n477\n00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:01.150\nIf there was such a thing as Bad Harry,\nhe could.\n\n478\n00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:04.460\nWe would call that Dirty Harry\nin the old movies where\n\n479\n00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:07.390\nClint Eastwood played the cop who would\njust walk around shooting everybody.\n\n480\n00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:08.870\nSo there is a movie called Dirty Harry.\n\n481\n00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:11.560\nI have not heard of one called Bad Harry.\n\n482\n00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.500\nBut if there is such a thing as evil or\nbad Harry, if evil or\n\n483\n00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.240\nbad Harry created a botnet.\n\n484\n00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:19.690\nNot that he would create\na botnet to necessarily try this,\n\n485\n00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:22.310\nbut he would just bring\ntogether probably a grid,\n\n486\n00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:25.160\na whole bunch of computers that\nare controlled, essentially like a botnet.\n\n487\n00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.853\nAnd he would try to then have all of\nthem just go through multiples and keys.\n\n488\n00:22:27.853 --> 00:22:29.987\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say that, but\nI didn't know how rich he was,\n\n489\n00:22:29.987 --> 00:22:32.070\nif he could afford all\nthat extra hardware.\n\n490\n00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:35.180\nWell, if he's really bad, at good at being\nbad, he's probably hacked into a lot of\n\n491\n00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:36.890\nother computers and\nprobably stole everybody's money.\n\n492\n00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:38.320\nSo, he probably has\na whole bunch of money.\n\n493\n00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.180\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Or if he has the all powerful one wand,\n\n494\n00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:43.850\nhe could just make up money and\nthat wouldn't be an issue.\n\n495\n00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:44.440\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n496\n00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.765\nYou can just conjure them up, right?\n\n497\n00:22:45.765 --> 00:22:47.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Dumbledore's wand.\n\n498\n00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:49.760\n&gt;&gt; Then he would just conjure up\nthe keys and wouldn't need the computer.\n\n499\n00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:50.343\n&gt;&gt; He would just conjure the keys.\n\n500\n00:22:50.343 --> 00:22:51.589\nSo he wouldn't need.\n\n501\n00:22:51.589 --> 00:22:54.940\nWelcome to the Harry Potter\nhour here at ITProTV.\n\n502\n00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:59.250\nWe'll be answering questions about your\nneeds, with regards to wizardry and\n\n503\n00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:01.960\nhow we can better serve\nthem through cryptography.\n\n504\n00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.600\nSo key space and work factor,\nvery important to think about that.\n\n505\n00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.990\nAnd it is a good way of\nthinking about that, right.\n\n506\n00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:10.500\nJust think about the idea the bigger\nthe key space, the longer the work factor.\n\n507\n00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:13.670\nBecause the bigger the number of keys we\nhave to try, the more time it will take.\n\n508\n00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:17.200\nLinking those two together, ideally,\nvisualization vector, you mentioned this\n\n509\n00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.750\nwhen we were talking about WEP\na little bit in the last episode.\n\n510\n00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:23.940\nIt was one of the two contributory\nfactors that led to the failure of WEP\n\n511\n00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.920\nbecause the IV was small and mentioned\nit was implemented as a 24-bit IV.\n\n512\n00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.770\nIt should have been bigger.\n\n513\n00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:32.220\nAnd as a result of that,\nthe secret string that was injected\n\n514\n00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:36.830\nrandomly in the beginning was\nnot unfortunately long enough.\n\n515\n00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:39.920\nAnd because of that it was a problem\nbecause it led to compromise.\n\n516\n00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.122\nThat and\nthe fact that the key space was so small,\n\n517\n00:23:42.122 --> 00:23:44.444\nwe didn't use a very large number of keys,\nright?\n\n518\n00:23:44.444 --> 00:23:46.449\nHarry hadn't been able to\nget all the money together,\n\n519\n00:23:46.449 --> 00:23:48.377\nhe absolutely couldn't\nafford to buy a lot of keys.\n\n520\n00:23:48.377 --> 00:23:49.804\nSo make sure you know the IV,\n\n521\n00:23:49.804 --> 00:23:53.436\nthe initialization vector is\nessentially an injection of randomness.\n\n522\n00:23:53.436 --> 00:23:56.827\nIt's a random set of, or\na random string of characters we\n\n523\n00:23:56.827 --> 00:24:01.353\ninject into the beginning of the\nencryption run to add further complexity,\n\n524\n00:24:01.353 --> 00:24:05.450\nthrough obfuscation, so\nthat we are hiding what we're doing.\n\n525\n00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:08.990\nAnd you now have to guess the key,\nplus the initialization vector.\n\n526\n00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:13.630\nTo be able to truly unencrypted and\nunwind all the way back that solution so\n\n527\n00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:16.180\nwe get back to the original playing text,\nso it adds complexity.\n\n528\n00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:19.038\nThat's what the initialization\nfactor does.\n\n529\n00:24:19.038 --> 00:24:22.899\nEncoding, by the way, initialization\nfactor, when we talk about hashing and\n\n530\n00:24:22.899 --> 00:24:27.003\nstoring the hashing, that's what happens\nwhen Harry doesn't pay the power bill.\n\n531\n00:24:27.003 --> 00:24:30.140\nYou see, he's too busy spending\nall his money on the botnet.\n\n532\n00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.470\nForgets to pay the power bill and\nour screen goes dark.\n\n533\n00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:34.720\nThat's actually just me not moving\nmy mouse while we're talking,\n\n534\n00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:35.940\nhitting the time out.\n\n535\n00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:38.660\nBut what I was going to say\nwith initialization vector is,\n\n536\n00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:43.230\nwhat we talked about hashing and\nstoring passwords that are hashed.\n\n537\n00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:45.820\nThe hash value of the password\nif we do for authentication.\n\n538\n00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:48.679\nWhen we store them we also\ntalk about using IVs and\n\n539\n00:24:48.679 --> 00:24:50.568\nwe talk about salting the hash.\n\n540\n00:24:50.568 --> 00:24:52.596\nYou may have heard this\nterm before salting.\n\n541\n00:24:52.596 --> 00:24:54.657\n&gt;&gt; I was actually just going to ask\nyou that and about key stretching and\n\n542\n00:24:54.657 --> 00:24:56.337\nhow those two relate here in\nthis instance or compare.\n\n543\n00:24:56.337 --> 00:25:00.617\n&gt;&gt; So not so much key stretching but\nthe idea of salting specifically relates\n\n544\n00:25:00.617 --> 00:25:05.586\nto the IV because when we're salting the\nhash, we're adding initialization vector\n\n545\n00:25:05.586 --> 00:25:09.190\nrandom [CROSSTALK] into the hash\nthat has to be been broken out.\n\n546\n00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:14.290\nAnd essentially taken out of the mix when\nwe use the hash to validate the password.\n\n547\n00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:18.480\nSo when we store hash securely for\nauthentication purposes, for\n\n548\n00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:19.690\nuser name and passwords.\n\n549\n00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:22.923\nWe salt them to add an extra layer\nof protection to them, and that's\n\n550\n00:25:22.923 --> 00:25:26.799\nusing an IV specifically injected into\nthat stream to be able to add randomness.\n\n551\n00:25:26.799 --> 00:25:28.525\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; This isn't something we're doing\n\n552\n00:25:28.525 --> 00:25:30.777\nmanually, it's programmed into that\nsoftware typically, behind the scenes.\n\n553\n00:25:30.777 --> 00:25:32.534\n&gt;&gt; You would do it through software.\n\n554\n00:25:32.534 --> 00:25:37.120\nYou have to usually choose select to\nsalt the hashes when you store them.\n\n555\n00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:41.350\nIt's typically a setting in the directory\nservice and the LDAP provider's\n\n556\n00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:45.050\ndatabase where we store the hashes\nof the usernames and passwords.\n\n557\n00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:49.120\nYou would in Linux for instance you\ncan use the Etsy Shadow file to\n\n558\n00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:53.960\nstore the passwords in the hash securely\nby salting them or the equivalent of it.\n\n559\n00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:57.091\nIn Windows you would implement\nsalting as a feature or\n\n560\n00:25:57.091 --> 00:25:58.979\na function that's added in to.\n\n561\n00:25:58.979 --> 00:26:02.643\nAnd is either turned on automatically, in\nmany cases it is, or you would enable it\n\n562\n00:26:02.643 --> 00:26:05.845\nas a feature, depending on the version\nof the OS, you would enable it.\n\n563\n00:26:05.845 --> 00:26:09.350\nBut, once it's done,\nit's implemented through software.\n\n564\n00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:11.580\nCuz the directory service then does that.\n\n565\n00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:13.347\nBut you would have to typically\nenable it in some form.\n\n566\n00:26:13.347 --> 00:26:15.634\n&gt;&gt; Configure it.\n&gt;&gt; And then software takes it on and\n\n567\n00:26:15.634 --> 00:26:17.450\ndoes it for you, absolutely.\n\n568\n00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:21.562\nIn coding, the act, as you can see there,\nof changing message formats from one to\n\n569\n00:26:21.562 --> 00:26:23.899\nanother through the use\nof some sort of a code.\n\n570\n00:26:23.899 --> 00:26:27.020\nSo encoding or decoding,\nencrypting, decrypting.\n\n571\n00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:29.920\nEncoding is like encrypting,\ndecoding is decrypting.\n\n572\n00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.220\nIt's the same idea,\nthey're just synonyms for one another.\n\n573\n00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:34.300\nWe just continue to go through them.\n\n574\n00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:37.819\nAnd you can see decoding right there,\nthe reverse process from encoding.\n\n575\n00:26:37.819 --> 00:26:41.610\nConverting the encoded message\nback into plain text form.\n\n576\n00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:44.630\nWe talked about encoding and\ndecoding when we use CodeX, for\n\n577\n00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:46.390\naudio and video for instance.\n\n578\n00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:50.769\nWe encode or decode the streams to be able\nto transfer the data into the appropriate\n\n579\n00:26:50.769 --> 00:26:54.269\nform and that's just another way\nof using this thought process.\n\n580\n00:26:54.269 --> 00:26:56.873\nTransposition or\npermutation and substitution.\n\n581\n00:26:56.873 --> 00:26:59.817\nI know you had asked me about these\nwhen we're getting the list together and\n\n582\n00:26:59.817 --> 00:27:01.463\nsaid, you know, you have them on there.\n\n583\n00:27:01.463 --> 00:27:04.490\nAnd are those some of the terms that we\nmost likely have already defined, right,\n\n584\n00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:06.815\nas part of our conversations in\nsome of the earlier episodes.\n\n585\n00:27:06.815 --> 00:27:08.557\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; When we went through the historical\n\n586\n00:27:08.557 --> 00:27:11.260\nalgorithms and talked about some of\nthat and the answer is absolutely.\n\n587\n00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:13.975\nBut, it's still important for\nus to remind you of what these terms are,\n\n588\n00:27:13.975 --> 00:27:15.815\njust to make sure we're\ncomfortable with them.\n\n589\n00:27:15.815 --> 00:27:19.250\nTransposition or permutation.\n\n590\n00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:22.010\nThis is the slopping or\nshifting of blocks of text.\n\n591\n00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:26.850\nSo we talked about this where we took\na look at both transposition and or\n\n592\n00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:30.620\nsubstitution, changing some part of\nthe plain text or the cryptotext for\n\n593\n00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:31.760\ndifferent value.\n\n594\n00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:35.230\nWe talk about both of these with\nthings like the Caesar Cipher.\n\n595\n00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:38.240\nWe talked about them with\nthe Play Fair Cipher.\n\n596\n00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:43.190\nWe talked about it with the cypher,\nthe AFGVRX 123\n\n597\n00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:47.290\nthing that we talked about,\nall the different cyphers as you know.\n\n598\n00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:49.640\nWe did demos on some of these,\nCrypt Tool right so\n\n599\n00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:51.530\nwe took a look at a few of them and\nsaw how they worked.\n\n600\n00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:55.840\nBut substitution and transposition are\nconcepts you just wanna be familiar with.\n\n601\n00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.230\nThe rail thin cypher is\none that's often used for\n\n602\n00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:01.690\ntransposition, it's an old one we\ndidn't go through but you can see that.\n\n603\n00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:05.190\nThe idea is, or substitution,\nyou can see it from either perspective.\n\n604\n00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:10.469\nBut a lot of times these are used together\nas overlapping things we put into a crypto\n\n605\n00:28:10.469 --> 00:28:15.383\nsystem to further hide, obfuscate,\nor confuse and diffuse information.\n\n606\n00:28:15.383 --> 00:28:18.430\nAnd you'll see confusion and\ndiffusion right down there as well.\n\n607\n00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:20.940\nThese are also,\nalong with the avalanche effect.\n\n608\n00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:25.220\nThese are also all terms that are very\nimportant with regards to vocabulary,\n\n609\n00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:26.990\nbecause we have to\nunderstand their impact.\n\n610\n00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:30.168\nThe SP network,\nas in substitution permutation.\n\n611\n00:28:30.168 --> 00:28:34.533\nSo SP network below transposition or\npermutation and substitution right here,\n\n612\n00:28:34.533 --> 00:28:39.167\nis really just the idea of combining,\nas we've said, transposition, [CROSSTALK].\n\n613\n00:28:39.167 --> 00:28:41.627\nCommonly called permutation and\nsubstitution together.\n\n614\n00:28:41.627 --> 00:28:42.643\nSo we combine them together.\n\n615\n00:28:42.643 --> 00:28:43.265\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n616\n00:28:43.265 --> 00:28:48.003\n&gt;&gt; And as a result of that by doing\niterations of this just cycling through\n\n617\n00:28:48.003 --> 00:28:51.859\nmultiple rounds of substitutions and\npermutations, so\n\n618\n00:28:51.859 --> 00:28:55.360\nwe add confusion and\ndiffusion to the process.\n\n619\n00:28:55.360 --> 00:29:00.126\nWe make it much harder for the bad actor\nto unwind all those operations going\n\n620\n00:29:00.126 --> 00:29:02.557\nthe other way to be able to unencrypt.\n\n621\n00:29:02.557 --> 00:29:07.177\nSo the SP network is the idea of how\nmany times are we gonna substitute and\n\n622\n00:29:07.177 --> 00:29:09.030\npermutate as we go through.\n\n623\n00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:12.104\nAre we doing in 10 times,\n12 times, 20 times etc.\n\n624\n00:29:12.104 --> 00:29:14.959\nAnd by doing that we're\nadding more complexity.\n\n625\n00:29:14.959 --> 00:29:18.114\nAnd complexity is often referred\nto by us defining or bringing\n\n626\n00:29:18.114 --> 00:29:22.553\ninto the conversation the concepts of\nconfusion, diffusion, and the fact.\n\n627\n00:29:22.553 --> 00:29:25.661\nSo, these are three terms you\noften hear discussed as well.\n\n628\n00:29:25.661 --> 00:29:28.032\nConfusion is provided by\nmixing as you can see or\n\n629\n00:29:28.032 --> 00:29:32.417\nchanging the key values that are used\nduring the repeated rounds of encryption.\n\n630\n00:29:32.417 --> 00:29:34.877\nSo we're adding confusion by changing.\n\n631\n00:29:34.877 --> 00:29:39.027\nWe are diffusing or\ndiffusion by providing mixing or\n\n632\n00:29:39.027 --> 00:29:42.467\nrather by mixing up the location of\nthe plain text throughout the cipher text.\n\n633\n00:29:42.467 --> 00:29:45.017\nSo we are going to transpose and\n\n634\n00:29:45.017 --> 00:29:47.460\nsubstitute to create confusion and\ndiffusion.\n\n635\n00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:52.672\nAnd when we diffuse we are going after\nultimately what is known or what has\n\n636\n00:29:52.672 --> 00:29:58.925\nbeen re-branded as the avalanche effect\nbecause diffusion in the avalanche effect.\n\n637\n00:29:58.925 --> 00:30:03.862\nOr excuse me, confusion in the avalanche\neffect are going to be combinations of\n\n638\n00:30:03.862 --> 00:30:06.823\nthe same thing when we\ncombine these together.\n\n639\n00:30:06.823 --> 00:30:11.948\nWhat we're really thinking of is making\na minor change In some part of the system,\n\n640\n00:30:11.948 --> 00:30:13.376\nand amplifying that.\n\n641\n00:30:13.376 --> 00:30:16.619\nAnd magnifying as it goes out so\nthat if we shift one bit,\n\n642\n00:30:16.619 --> 00:30:19.655\nwe will then shift,\nthrough the avalanche effect,\n\n643\n00:30:19.655 --> 00:30:23.324\nwe wanna see an incremental change\nof other bits down the line.\n\n644\n00:30:23.324 --> 00:30:26.104\nAnd the bigger the magnified\nchange at the end of the process,\n\n645\n00:30:26.104 --> 00:30:28.619\nthe more confusion and\ndiffusion we've implemented,\n\n646\n00:30:28.619 --> 00:30:32.010\nthe less likely it is somebody\ncan understand what we've done.\n\n647\n00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:36.150\nSo the avalanche effect is the propagation\nof change, and the impact of that change\n\n648\n00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:40.260\nis it broadens and magnifies, or\nis amplified through the system.\n\n649\n00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:44.068\nYou hear this referred to outside in\nChaos Theory as the Butterfly Effect.\n\n650\n00:30:44.068 --> 00:30:45.970\nYou may generically have heard of this.\n\n651\n00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:49.819\nYou have the butterfly flapping its\nwings in the Amazon in the rainforest,\n\n652\n00:30:49.819 --> 00:30:53.854\nthrough a series of seemingly disconnected\nbut interconnected activities,\n\n653\n00:30:53.854 --> 00:30:56.375\nleads to a tsunami that\ntakes out half the world.\n\n654\n00:30:56.375 --> 00:30:57.840\n20 steps later.\n\n655\n00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:00.900\nBecause the idea is that everything\nbuilds on everything else, right?\n\n656\n00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:05.130\nAnd so, when a butterfly flaps its wings,\nit may disturb the air current around it.\n\n657\n00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:10.130\nThat disturbing of the air current\nmay send either spores or pollen.\n\n658\n00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:14.391\nOr some sort of information or\nsomething from a plant, scattering around.\n\n659\n00:31:14.391 --> 00:31:19.031\nAnd lead to the diffusion of different\nplant seeds in different areas at the base\n\n660\n00:31:19.031 --> 00:31:20.360\nof that tree.\n\n661\n00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:24.407\nThat diffusion over time may lead to\nadditional trees growing up that may take\n\n662\n00:31:24.407 --> 00:31:27.210\nmore chemicals out of the air,\ncreate more oxygen and\n\n663\n00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:29.960\nmaybe everybody's better off as a result,\nright?\n\n664\n00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:33.254\nSo, there's all these effects that happen\ndown the line is what we're talking about.\n\n665\n00:31:33.254 --> 00:31:34.100\nIt's the idea of the avalanche.\n\n666\n00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:35.240\n&gt;&gt; I had to look this up real quick,\n\n667\n00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.947\nbut it was Claude Shannon\nwho came up with that.\n\n668\n00:31:36.947 --> 00:31:37.540\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it was.\n\n669\n00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:38.604\n&gt;&gt; Who came up with that for\ndiffusion [CROSSTALK]\n\n670\n00:31:38.604 --> 00:31:39.676\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna talk about that in one of\n\n671\n00:31:39.676 --> 00:31:40.653\nour upcoming conversations in.\n\n672\n00:31:40.653 --> 00:31:41.397\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n673\n00:31:41.397 --> 00:31:44.900\n&gt;&gt; Symmetric cryptography, where we\ntalk about symmetric and asymmetric.\n\n674\n00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:47.042\nAnd actually define the concept\nof the avalanche effect.\n\n675\n00:31:47.042 --> 00:31:51.809\nLink it back to Shannon and his taking of\nthat concept of confusion and diffusion.\n\n676\n00:31:51.809 --> 00:31:53.333\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n&gt;&gt; Linking it to the new one and\n\n677\n00:31:53.333 --> 00:31:55.606\ntalking about that,\nit's an updated version of that.\n\n678\n00:31:55.606 --> 00:32:00.409\nShannon actually writes a seminal paper\nin 1949 in the Bell Laboratories Journal\n\n679\n00:32:00.409 --> 00:32:04.878\nthat leads, then, to a book about a year\nlater on mathematical theor,y with,\n\n680\n00:32:04.878 --> 00:32:07.967\nI forget the other gentleman's\nname he wrote it with.\n\n681\n00:32:07.967 --> 00:32:11.072\nBut he writes this article,\nthen writes this book, and\n\n682\n00:32:11.072 --> 00:32:14.940\nthat leads to the founding of\nwhat we call information theory.\n\n683\n00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:18.410\nWhich is the science and the mathematics\naround all the stuff we do today.\n\n684\n00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:20.660\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, he's a pretty important guy.\n\n685\n00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:24.190\nJust like Turing was, and we mentioned\nAlan Turing, one of our prior episodes.\n\n686\n00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:26.232\nShannon, in his own right, very,\n\n687\n00:32:26.232 --> 00:32:29.511\nvery big figure in the history\nof the back-end history.\n\n688\n00:32:29.511 --> 00:32:33.006\nNot so much of cryptography directly,\nbut information theory, which leads\n\n689\n00:32:33.006 --> 00:32:36.289\nto the modern electronical versions and\ntheories and thought processes\n\n690\n00:32:36.289 --> 00:32:39.967\nwe have around computing, and the\nimplementation of cryptography through it.\n\n691\n00:32:39.967 --> 00:32:43.153\nHe's a really big guy,\nwith regards to that stuff, very,\n\n692\n00:32:43.153 --> 00:32:44.890\nvery important person as well.\n\n693\n00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:47.037\nAll right, so\nwe have the avalanche effect.\n\n694\n00:32:47.037 --> 00:32:50.715\nJust quickly wrap up, two last things and\nI think we're just about on track to\n\n695\n00:32:50.715 --> 00:32:53.958\nfinish up here, and not have a part 25,\nor whatever we're up to.\n\n696\n00:32:53.958 --> 00:32:56.105\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz we should be able to wrap up our\n\n697\n00:32:56.105 --> 00:32:58.498\ndefinitions and\nour vocabulary conversations here with\n\n698\n00:32:58.498 --> 00:33:01.010\nyou at the end of this episode\nin the next couple of minutes.\n\n699\n00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:03.926\nSo, stream ciphers and\nblock ciphers we've talked about, and\n\n700\n00:33:03.926 --> 00:33:07.716\nyou've heard me refer before when we\ntalked about synchronous and asynchronous.\n\n701\n00:33:07.716 --> 00:33:10.479\nBack again in our first\nepisode around vocabulary,\n\n702\n00:33:10.479 --> 00:33:12.865\nwe talked about the idea\nthat synchronous and\n\n703\n00:33:12.865 --> 00:33:16.903\nasynchronous concepts are linked to\nthe ideas of stream and block ciphers.\n\n704\n00:33:16.903 --> 00:33:21.549\nThat synchronous systems are running in\na continuous linear progression or stream,\n\n705\n00:33:21.549 --> 00:33:25.691\nand they operate on one bit at a time\ncontinuously, like stream ciphers do.\n\n706\n00:33:25.691 --> 00:33:30.491\nSo stream ciphers are synchronous, right,\nwhereas asynchronous systems block or\n\n707\n00:33:30.491 --> 00:33:34.208\nchunk information together into\na certain amount of block bits,\n\n708\n00:33:34.208 --> 00:33:37.878\nlet's say 128 randomly, or\n64, or something like that.\n\n709\n00:33:37.878 --> 00:33:42.839\nSo imagine a box, we put 64 or\n128 items in the box, close the box up,\n\n710\n00:33:42.839 --> 00:33:44.370\nship it down the line.\n\n711\n00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:48.577\nAnd we operate in a block cipher on\nblocks of text, not one bit at a time,\n\n712\n00:33:48.577 --> 00:33:50.629\nthat's an asynchronous system.\n\n713\n00:33:50.629 --> 00:33:54.919\nSo we do wanna make sure we understand\nthe concepts of stream and block ciphers.\n\n714\n00:33:54.919 --> 00:33:58.418\nRemember we're going to think about\na cipher as being the algorithm, right, so\n\n715\n00:33:58.418 --> 00:34:00.388\nthat's how they're gonna be implemented.\n\n716\n00:34:00.388 --> 00:34:03.274\nAnd we're gonna come back and\nhave a conversation later on,\n\n717\n00:34:03.274 --> 00:34:06.219\nnot in this episode, but\nin future upcoming conversations,\n\n718\n00:34:06.219 --> 00:34:09.180\nabout both asymmetric and\nsymmetric cryptography systems.\n\n719\n00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:11.849\nAnd we're gonna talk about stream and\nblock ciphers, how they work.\n\n720\n00:34:11.849 --> 00:34:14.503\nAnd we're gonna show you some\ninteresting pictures and\n\n721\n00:34:14.503 --> 00:34:17.622\ndiscussions about block ciphers and\nhow they're implemented.\n\n722\n00:34:17.622 --> 00:34:21.702\nElectronic code booking,\ncipher block chaining, propagated cipher\n\n723\n00:34:21.702 --> 00:34:25.853\nblock chaining, and all these different\nways that we implement these.\n\n724\n00:34:25.853 --> 00:34:29.315\nAnd walk through the logic of how\nwe actually do the rounds, right,\n\n725\n00:34:29.315 --> 00:34:33.085\nthe transposition and the substitution,\nall the different rounds, and\n\n726\n00:34:33.085 --> 00:34:34.325\nsee how that operates.\n\n727\n00:34:34.325 --> 00:34:38.760\nWhere we put the IV and-or the key in,\nhow random it is, and all that stuff.\n\n728\n00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:41.396\nWe'll be going through all that\nas we continue this conversation.\n\n729\n00:34:41.396 --> 00:34:45.059\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good, Adam, thank you for at\nleast giving us a good foundation here for\n\n730\n00:34:45.059 --> 00:34:48.723\nour definitions, and then I look forward\nto looking at those individually and\n\n731\n00:34:48.723 --> 00:34:50.405\nreally dissecting those further.\n\n732\n00:34:50.405 --> 00:34:52.738\nAnd thank you, ladies and\ngentlemen, for joining us today.\n\n733\n00:34:52.738 --> 00:34:56.013\nBut we're gonna go ahead and sign off for\nthis show, remember, I'm your host,\n\n734\n00:34:56.013 --> 00:34:56.744\nCherokee Boose.\n\n735\n00:34:56.744 --> 00:34:58.079\n&gt;&gt; I'm

00:00:06.289\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:08.184\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.184 --> 00:00:11.948\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.948 --> 00:00:14.242\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your ECES series.\n\n7\n00:00:14.242 --> 00:00:16.630\n&gt;&gt; I'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.900\nIn this episode,\nwe'll be looking at symmetric encryption,\n\n9\n00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.997\nsymmetric cryptography,\nas well as hashing algorithms.\n\n10\n00:00:22.997 --> 00:00:25.686\nWith us today, we have Mr.\nAdam Gordon, in studio.\n\n11\n00:00:25.686 --> 00:00:27.480\nThank you for joining us today Adam.\n\n12\n00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.600\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome.\n\n13\n00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.875\nSymmetric encryption,\nsymmetric cryptography.\n\n14\n00:00:30.875 --> 00:00:34.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; E, single D encrypt it.\n\n15\n00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.140\nAnd we've talked about this before\nin some of our other conversations.\n\n16\n00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.292\nWe've talked about both private key,\nwhat we would call single key, same key.\n\n17\n00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:45.840\nAnd/or and\nbecause I have to give Cherokee credit,\n\n18\n00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.735\nshe actually came in before the show and\nsaid, hey, I made some props.\n\n19\n00:00:49.735 --> 00:00:51.089\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna give you keys, so\n\n20\n00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:52.168\nwe could talk about keys.\n\n21\n00:00:52.168 --> 00:00:55.678\nSo we're to talk about\nsingle key encryption,\n\n22\n00:00:55.678 --> 00:01:01.220\nbecause this is the key that you must\nkeep secret and not show it to anybody.\n\n23\n00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.813\nIt's the private key.\n\n24\n00:01:01.813 --> 00:01:03.741\nSo, when I hand the key to Cherokee.\n\n25\n00:01:03.741 --> 00:01:04.997\n&gt;&gt; Thanks.\n&gt;&gt; She's gonna keep track of it.\n\n26\n00:01:04.997 --> 00:01:08.639\nAnd make sure that we don't lose it and\nwe're gonna keep it secret, so\n\n27\n00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:09.640\nnobody can see it.\n\n28\n00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.990\n&gt;&gt; I can't even keep track\nof my phone [LAUGH].\n\n29\n00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.999\n&gt;&gt; Well don't lose that key cuz we're\ngonna have to redo the whole entire\n\n30\n00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:16.540\ndiscussion, if you lose that key.\n\n31\n00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.584\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; You won't be able to unencrypt it and\n\n32\n00:01:18.584 --> 00:01:20.850\nopen it up for everybody,\nso don't lose the key.\n\n33\n00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.430\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n\n34\n00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.080\n&gt;&gt; So she's the key keeper.\n\n35\n00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.260\nShe's gonna keep track of the keys for\nthis episode.\n\n36\n00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.650\nSo we're gonna talk about single key\nencryption, or what we call symmetric\n\n37\n00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.310\nencryption, symmetric cryptography,\nsingle key or private key.\n\n38\n00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.155\nThe idea behind this, and\nwe talked about this if you remember and\n\n39\n00:01:35.155 --> 00:01:37.962\nwe'd encourage you to take a look\nat our prior episodes on this.\n\n40\n00:01:37.962 --> 00:01:39.834\nWe went through three,\nI think it was three.\n\n41\n00:01:39.834 --> 00:01:43.790\nThree episodes on vocabulary and\ncryptography terminology.\n\n42\n00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.590\nAnd talked about single key or symmetric.\n\n43\n00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.240\nTalked about asymmetric.\n\n44\n00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.820\nTalked about synchronous, asynchronous.\n\n45\n00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.620\nTalked about streams and block cyphers.\n\n46\n00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.140\nTalked about initialization factors.\n\n47\n00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.660\nTalked about PKI.\n\n48\n00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.880\nWe talked about a lot of stuff.\n\n49\n00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.395\n&gt;&gt; We sure did.\n\n50\n00:01:59.395 --> 00:02:00.640\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All those other people that don't\n\n51\n00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.490\ndo any work around here, we did episodes\nfor days, got all that stuff done.\n\n52\n00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.610\nSo we went through all that.\n\n53\n00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.170\nEncourage you to go take a look,\nmake sure you have gone through that.\n\n54\n00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.980\nThose three episodes will be\nfoundational for this set of episodes.\n\n55\n00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.480\nWe're gonna through on symmetric.\n\n56\n00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.626\nThe episodes that will follow\nthis on asymmetric cryptography,\n\n57\n00:02:18.626 --> 00:02:20.465\nlooking at both sides, how it works.\n\n58\n00:02:20.465 --> 00:02:24.320\nWhen we add the second key in, with\nasymmetric of a public private key pair.\n\n59\n00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.799\nHow does that change what we do,\nhow does that reinforce what we do.\n\n60\n00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:29.562\nWe're going to go through\nall that with you, but\n\n61\n00:02:29.562 --> 00:02:31.895\nwe're going to focus on symmetric\ncryptography for right now.\n\n62\n00:02:31.895 --> 00:02:35.104\nI wanna start talking about the ideas\nbehind single key encryption.\n\n63\n00:02:35.104 --> 00:02:39.610\nWhen we have a private key,\na single key only, we have a challenge and\n\n64\n00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.970\nthe challenge is,\nhow do we use that key securely?\n\n65\n00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.216\nWe refer back to Kerckhoffs' Principle,\nwe've talked about this before.\n\n66\n00:02:46.216 --> 00:02:49.974\nMr. Kerckhoff said to us, hey,\ntell the bad actors everything, but\n\n67\n00:02:49.974 --> 00:02:51.257\nkeep one thing secret.\n\n68\n00:02:51.257 --> 00:02:52.232\nAnd that one thing is.\n\n69\n00:02:52.232 --> 00:02:53.841\n&gt;&gt; Ta da.\n\n70\n00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:54.352\n&gt;&gt; Ta da.\n\n71\n00:02:54.352 --> 00:02:55.864\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The private key,\n\n72\n00:02:55.864 --> 00:02:59.829\ndo not show the private key because\nif we show the private key,\n\n73\n00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.334\nif we expose it in some way or\nwe transfer it in some way,\n\n74\n00:03:03.334 --> 00:03:07.404\nthat winds up being insecure or\nsomehow leads to key exposure.\n\n75\n00:03:07.404 --> 00:03:11.540\nWe're gonna give away literally,\nthe key that opens up every message.\n\n76\n00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.860\nNot just a message, but\n\n77\n00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.030\nevery message that has been\nencrypted with this particular key.\n\n78\n00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.690\nAnd if we have been using this key for\nsometime,\n\n79\n00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.800\nwe potentially have\nexposed quite a deal or\n\n80\n00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.460\nquite a large amount of information,\nquite a big deal of information.\n\n81\n00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.500\nSo, we wanna keep in mind that we\nhave a significant challenge here.\n\n82\n00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.255\nAnd we're gonna show you what\nthis means in real time here.\n\n83\n00:03:31.255 --> 00:03:33.145\nWe're gonna do a little demo for you.\n\n84\n00:03:33.145 --> 00:03:36.833\nCherokee's been kind enough to help\nme put together some graphics,\n\n85\n00:03:36.833 --> 00:03:40.839\nwe're gonna use one of them to take\na look at symmetric key encryption, and\n\n86\n00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:43.143\nthe use of what the private\nkey looks like.\n\n87\n00:03:43.143 --> 00:03:44.318\nYou ready?\nWe are outstanding look at that.\n\n88\n00:03:44.318 --> 00:03:45.079\n&gt;&gt; They're just stick figures.\n\n89\n00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.865\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But you gotta introduce Bob and Alice,\n\n90\n00:03:48.865 --> 00:03:51.545\nit's always important to make\nsure that we introduce guests\n\n91\n00:03:51.545 --> 00:03:53.260\nappropriately when they\njoin us on the show.\n\n92\n00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.400\nSo, Bob and Alice are gonna join us here.\n\n93\n00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.890\nWe mentioned Bob and\nAlice in one of our prior episodes.\n\n94\n00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.060\nTalked about the fact that traditionally,\nwe use Bob and Alice to help us refer\n\n95\n00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.750\nto and explain through the different\naspects of cryptography.\n\n96\n00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.840\nWe Invited them to join\nus here this morning.\n\n97\n00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.590\nWe had to bribe them with\na little Starbucks coffee.\n\n98\n00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.340\nBut after that, they were ready to go.\n\n99\n00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.750\nSo Alice has a good hair day going on,\nwhich is very nice to see.\n\n100\n00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.332\nBob on the other hand,\nhe rolled out of bed this morning.\n\n101\n00:04:17.332 --> 00:04:19.230\nReally didn't do much to get ready for\nthe show.\n\n102\n00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.545\nBut you can see Alice is\nwearing a pretty dress.\n\n103\n00:04:20.545 --> 00:04:21.465\nSo she's all set and ready to go.\n\n104\n00:04:21.465 --> 00:04:22.460\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n105\n00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.397\n&gt;&gt; So Alice is gonna be the one who is\ngonna actually send the message in our\n\n106\n00:04:26.397 --> 00:04:27.280\nexample here.\n\n107\n00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.205\nAnd we can see that she's got a message\na little blue piece of paper there,\n\n108\n00:04:31.205 --> 00:04:32.803\nkind of teed up, ready to go.\n\n109\n00:04:32.803 --> 00:04:35.311\nAnd at the lower left\nhand corner under Alice,\n\n110\n00:04:35.311 --> 00:04:39.685\nwith a blue arrow arching up towards the\nmessage, we can see there's a circle and\n\n111\n00:04:39.685 --> 00:04:44.300\ninside we have what we now know will\nbe her private key, her symmetric key.\n\n112\n00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.500\nAnd so the easy part for this exchanges\nanalyse uses your private key,\n\n113\n00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.310\nsends a message over to Bob and gives Bob,\n\n114\n00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.132\nin whatever the message is but\ngives it to him in an encrypted form.\n\n115\n00:04:57.132 --> 00:05:01.100\nWe're applying confidentiality an\nencryption protections to the message in\n\n116\n00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.380\nthis case and as a result,\nwe are sending a secure transmission.\n\n117\n00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.960\nSo we have to think about\na couple of things here.\n\n118\n00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.710\nNumber one, where is Alice\ngonna keep that private key?\n\n119\n00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.880\nBecause we've said she has\nto keep it secure, and so\n\n120\n00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.560\nshe just can't leave it laying around.\n\n121\n00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.270\nI mean right now, it's in this circle\n\n122\n00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.240\ntheoretically protected by some\nsort of magical force field.\n\n123\n00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.760\n&gt;&gt; Bubble.\n\n124\n00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.980\n&gt;&gt; A bubble whatever it may be.\n\n125\n00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.830\nBut where does she keep it when she's\nnot actually pulling it out and\n\n126\n00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:26.420\nshe's gonna use it?\n\n127\n00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.940\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n128\n00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.640\n&gt;&gt; That's a big question for us.\n\n129\n00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.502\nAnd so, Alice would have some option.\n\n130\n00:05:30.502 --> 00:05:33.819\nShe may, depending on how\nshe chooses to set this up,\n\n131\n00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:37.893\nshe may decide to store that\nprivate key in an directory.\n\n132\n00:05:37.893 --> 00:05:40.896\nSo we've talked about Windows for\ninstance in Microsoft,\n\n133\n00:05:40.896 --> 00:05:44.150\nusing active directory\ncertificates services, ADCS.\n\n134\n00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:49.030\nAnd the ability to store that private key\nattached to a certificate most likely,\n\n135\n00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.180\nwith her user profile in the active\ndirectory would be one option for Alice.\n\n136\n00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.525\nSo that may be an option.\n\n137\n00:05:54.525 --> 00:05:59.110\nShe may choose to take that private\nkey store it in some sort of a TPM,\n\n138\n00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.048\na trusted platform module.\n\n139\n00:06:01.048 --> 00:06:03.672\nAn HSM, a hardware security module.\n\n140\n00:06:03.672 --> 00:06:06.593\nTPM is an internal piece of hardware,\n\n141\n00:06:06.593 --> 00:06:11.630\nthat is usually on motherboard\nintegrated as like crypto vault.\n\n142\n00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.850\nIt's basically going to be a little\narea with a secure processing\n\n143\n00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:21.060\ncapability build in, that is used to store\nyour digital identity, certificates,\n\n144\n00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.800\npasswords, things like that will need\nto be securely not only on machine.\n\n145\n00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.100\nIt's built in to the motherboard\nin most modern computers.\n\n146\n00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.366\nI have them on my laptops,\nhave them on my tablet.\n\n147\n00:06:31.366 --> 00:06:35.654\nWe use them to be able to do this based\non the software then they integrate with\n\n148\n00:06:35.654 --> 00:06:38.066\nthe hardware, so the operating system for\n\n149\n00:06:38.066 --> 00:06:40.549\ninstances would support\nthe use of the TPM.\n\n150\n00:06:40.549 --> 00:06:43.320\nVM ware supports this in their ESXI.\n\n151\n00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.900\nOperating system, Vista OS platform,\nmost modern operating systems support\n\n152\n00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.470\nit both for virtualization and\nfor non-virtualized uses.\n\n153\n00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:55.570\nSo Alice makes use to store her\nkeys in the TPM on a local machine.\n\n154\n00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:58.850\nThe HSM, the hardware security\nmodule is like a TPM, but\n\n155\n00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:00.770\nit's an external version of that.\n\n156\n00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.410\nIt would look to most of us\nprobably like a small USB drive,\n\n157\n00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:06.120\nthey essentially look like that.\n\n158\n00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.831\nBut you install them and\nuse them from outside the machine.\n\n159\n00:07:08.831 --> 00:07:14.535\nSo for rack mount servers, blades, things\nlike that that may not have built in TPMs.\n\n160\n00:07:14.535 --> 00:07:19.275\nOr if we need a portable version of a TPM\nthat can be moved between machines and\n\n161\n00:07:19.275 --> 00:07:22.620\nbecome a portable crypto vault,\nwe would use an HSM.\n\n162\n00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.950\nAnd so you could go out and\npurchase these, and\n\n163\n00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.610\nliterally they hook up\nthrough a USB-like interface.\n\n164\n00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.800\nAnd you would use them and\nshe could store her private key there.\n\n165\n00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.020\nAlice could also store the private\nkey on an external USB device,\n\n166\n00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.970\nsomething like USB thumb drive or\nan external drive.\n\n167\n00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.930\nAnd she could just plug it in\nwhenever she wants to use it.\n\n168\n00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:43.994\nSo an external key of some kind, or\n\n169\n00:07:43.994 --> 00:07:47.853\nrather an external storage system\nof some kind to store the key.\n\n170\n00:07:47.853 --> 00:07:51.598\nShe may, although we don't recommend\nthis certainly, write down the key and\n\n171\n00:07:51.598 --> 00:07:53.257\nhave to transcribe it an put it in.\n\n172\n00:07:53.257 --> 00:07:55.355\nBut there's the likelihood of error there.\n\n173\n00:07:55.355 --> 00:07:57.121\nThere's likelihood of compromise.\n\n174\n00:07:57.121 --> 00:07:59.673\nThere's the likelihood of\nlosing the piece of paper, or\n\n175\n00:07:59.673 --> 00:08:01.599\nlosing the information on the keys there.\n\n176\n00:08:01.599 --> 00:08:04.060\nSo, there's a lot of\nways this could be done.\n\n177\n00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.790\nBut we would hopefully council\nAlice to be smart about this, and\n\n178\n00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:10.400\nto focus on secure storage mechanisms,\nright?\n\n179\n00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.470\nIf we're dealing with cloud based\ncomputing, we may see Alice using the key.\n\n180\n00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:17.650\nAnd again,\nthe same thought processes are involved.\n\n181\n00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:21.340\nShe could be storing the key,\nand having key management and\n\n182\n00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:25.690\nkey escrow capabilities,\neither through the cloud vendor directly.\n\n183\n00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:28.340\nCloud vendors don't typically\nwanna have access to the keys,\n\n184\n00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:33.145\nthey'll have you generate them, they have\na Mechanism to do that, Amazon, AWS,\n\n185\n00:08:33.145 --> 00:08:37.245\nMicrosoft Azure, VMware,\nVMwares VCloud Air platform, etc.\n\n186\n00:08:37.245 --> 00:08:40.185\nThey all will give you\ncapabilities to generate keys,\n\n187\n00:08:40.185 --> 00:08:43.565\nbut they would like you as the customer\nto store them and manage them.\n\n188\n00:08:43.565 --> 00:08:45.545\nThey really don't wanna\nhave the liability, and\n\n189\n00:08:45.545 --> 00:08:46.835\nhaving to have to oversee them.\n\n190\n00:08:46.835 --> 00:08:49.620\nAnd as a result, have to deal with\nthem if something goes wrong.\n\n191\n00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:53.000\nSo, you will generate them and\ntypically store them somewhere securely.\n\n192\n00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.320\nSo, Alice may make a copy of this key\nan escrow with a trusted third party as\n\n193\n00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:01.680\na backup in case Bob loses a key or\nshe forgets it, something like that.\n\n194\n00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.180\nThere's a lot of different options here.\n\n195\n00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:10.480\nDifferent ways to go about this, security\nis a service of what we call CCAST today.\n\n196\n00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.920\nSo a cloud based purchase as\nyou go kind of thought process.\n\n197\n00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.030\nCould be brought to bear here around\nsomething like key management and\n\n198\n00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.630\nkey escrow.\n\n199\n00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:19.770\nSo there's a lot of\ndifferent ways to go and\n\n200\n00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.040\ncertainly options that\nAlice could explore.\n\n201\n00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.440\nBut however she does this she\nwould hopefully secure that key.\n\n202\n00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.610\nSo that part we can think is probably,\nhopefully well taken care of but\n\n203\n00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.260\nnow we run into a challenge, right?\n\n204\n00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:35.010\nSo Alice will practice due care and\ndue diligence, oversight and\n\n205\n00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:39.630\nmanagement of her key and\nfocusing on governance risk and compliance\n\n206\n00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:44.250\nrelated activities around key management\nto minimize the exposure of that key.\n\n207\n00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.700\nBut one of the things we have to\nworry about is along those lines,\n\n208\n00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:51.455\nhow does Alice take that key and\ntransfer it securely to Bob?\n\n209\n00:09:51.455 --> 00:09:54.580\nBecause sending the encrypted\nmessage is not the hard part here.\n\n210\n00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:58.310\nWe could send the encrypted message\nto Bob using any email platform,\n\n211\n00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:59.710\nit doesn't really matter.\n\n212\n00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:04.580\nBut the problem is Bob can't open and\ndecrypt the message unless he also\n\n213\n00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:07.400\nis in possession of that key,\nwhich is the bottom white arrow\n\n214\n00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.870\nkind of arching up towards up Bob, right,\nfrom our little key enclave there.\n\n215\n00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:15.230\nSo, we have to figure out how\nthat transmission takes place.\n\n216\n00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:19.990\nAnd this is the hardest part\nabout the key management and\n\n217\n00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:23.810\nthe symmetric encryption solution\nbecause there's only one key.\n\n218\n00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:28.710\nAnd every time we wanna use it, we have to\ntransfer it to whoever we're gonna send\n\n219\n00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:32.260\nthat information to, to ensure\nthey also have a copy of the key.\n\n220\n00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.070\nAnd this presents a significant\nchallenge for us.\n\n221\n00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:36.820\nBecause you can see we have\nan attacker lurking there,\n\n222\n00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:38.370\nat the bottom right-hand corner.\n\n223\n00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:41.040\nWe haven't said much about him or her yet.\n\n224\n00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.690\nBut waiting patiently there,\nwe've put a threat actor, a threat source,\n\n225\n00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:46.420\na bad actor, into the mix.\n\n226\n00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:50.360\nBut we're gonna show you that it may\nnot be hard for that attacker right?\n\n227\n00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.220\nTo interdict and\nsomehow get in between Alice and\n\n228\n00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.880\nBob and\nget a copy of that encrypted message.\n\n229\n00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.230\nBut really the goal is to\nget a copy of that key.\n\n230\n00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:02.050\nBecause the encrypted message by\nitself probably doesn't mean much to\n\n231\n00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:06.100\nthe attacker, certainly doesn't mean\nanything to Bob without the key and\n\n232\n00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.840\nis not gonna be of much use to anybody.\n\n233\n00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:12.160\nSo Alice sleeps well at night knowing\nthat her message is gonna be protected.\n\n234\n00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.580\nThis is confidentiality\nright from the center.\n\n235\n00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:18.210\nExactly what we've been talking\nas one of the three key pillars\n\n236\n00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:19.650\nof the information security.\n\n237\n00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:22.580\nRight, confidentiality,\nintegrity, and availability.\n\n238\n00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:26.325\nSo we're focusing on\nthe confidentiality aspect here.\n\n239\n00:11:26.325 --> 00:11:28.425\nBut the challenge is,\nhow do we move that private key over.\n\n240\n00:11:28.425 --> 00:11:30.165\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; So, what do you think will be some of\n\n241\n00:11:30.165 --> 00:11:33.105\nthe ways we could potentially\nsecurely transmit that key?\n\n242\n00:11:33.105 --> 00:11:34.235\nWell, what would we do?\n\n243\n00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:38.432\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so actually, I was sitting\nhere wondering from your perspective,\n\n244\n00:11:38.432 --> 00:11:40.192\nwhat would be the best option?\n\n245\n00:11:40.192 --> 00:11:42.171\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, you can't throw-\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, I al-\n\n246\n00:11:42.171 --> 00:11:43.275\n&gt;&gt; You can't throw the question back on\n\n247\n00:11:43.275 --> 00:11:45.205\nme, you've got to give me at least\none options before I answer.\n\n248\n00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:46.667\n&gt;&gt; All right, I'll give you two scenarios.\n\n249\n00:11:46.667 --> 00:11:48.542\n&gt;&gt; I will answer but\nyou've got to give me at least one first.\n\n250\n00:11:48.542 --> 00:11:50.272\n&gt;&gt; Okay, do you know Taylor Swift?\n\n251\n00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.590\n&gt;&gt; Do I know her personally?\n\n252\n00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:55.760\nI have not had the pleasure personally,\nbut I know of Taylor Swift.\n\n253\n00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:56.260\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n254\n00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.070\n&gt;&gt; So you're gonna flip this and\nnot do movies, you're gonna do music?\n\n255\n00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:00.859\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Just so before we random aside,\n\n256\n00:12:00.859 --> 00:12:02.401\nbecause this our random aside.\n\n257\n00:12:02.401 --> 00:12:05.222\nSo just so you understand\nwho you're doing music with.\n\n258\n00:12:05.222 --> 00:12:10.274\nI was in the music business for close\nto 20 years, and basically everything\n\n259\n00:12:10.274 --> 00:12:15.961\nfrom the early 1980s through probably\n2000 and beyond, I can do from memory.\n\n260\n00:12:15.961 --> 00:12:16.520\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n261\n00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:20.482\n&gt;&gt; So I was a DJ, I was a club manager,\nI was a promoter, you name it I did\n\n262\n00:12:20.482 --> 00:12:21.685\n&gt;&gt; So this is right up your ally then.\n\n263\n00:12:21.685 --> 00:12:24.478\n&gt;&gt; So I'm just saying,\nwe can do music trivia, but\n\n264\n00:12:24.478 --> 00:12:27.740\nmusic is like I'm even\nbetter movies with music.\n\n265\n00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:29.112\n&gt;&gt; Wow, that really sets the bar,\nall right.\n\n266\n00:12:29.112 --> 00:12:30.865\n&gt;&gt; So Taylor Swift, got it.\n\n267\n00:12:30.865 --> 00:12:32.132\n&gt;&gt; Taylor Swift, her friend.\n\n268\n00:12:32.132 --> 00:12:34.871\nDo you know who her male BFF is?\n\n269\n00:12:34.871 --> 00:12:37.088\n&gt;&gt; Ed Sheeran.\n\n270\n00:12:37.088 --> 00:12:38.146\n&gt;&gt; Ding, ding, ding, you got it.\n\n271\n00:12:38.146 --> 00:12:38.910\nOkay, cool.\n\n272\n00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:42.486\nSo Ed Sheeran, she wanted to\ncollaborate with him and do a song.\n\n273\n00:12:42.486 --> 00:12:47.347\nSo in order to get that song to Ed Sheeran\nfor him to view, she flew a carrier to,\n\n274\n00:12:47.347 --> 00:12:50.590\nwith an iPad with that song on it so\nhe could listen and\n\n275\n00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:52.530\nthen decide if they wanted to.\n\n276\n00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:53.671\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; To do it securely.\n\n277\n00:12:53.671 --> 00:12:55.274\n&gt;&gt; To do it securely-\n&gt;&gt; So nobody would pirate the song-\n\n278\n00:12:55.274 --> 00:12:55.991\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n279\n00:12:55.991 --> 00:12:56.572\n&gt;&gt; Or get it.\n\n280\n00:12:56.572 --> 00:12:59.970\nI'm gonna tell you a better about how\nyou transmit stuff securely in a minute.\n\n281\n00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:02.700\nHas nothing to do with music,\nhas to do with nuclear launch codes.\n\n282\n00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.270\n&gt;&gt; But I'm gonna tell you that\nstory in a minute, so go ahead.\n\n283\n00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:07.820\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nthat would be an example of out of bounds.\n\n284\n00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:12.030\n&gt;&gt; What we would call, I know what you're\nsaying, we don't call it out of bounds,\n\n285\n00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:14.300\nbut I understand what you're saying.\n\n286\n00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:15.955\n&gt;&gt; We're not using\nthe network to transmit that.\n\n287\n00:13:15.955 --> 00:13:18.857\n&gt;&gt; Right, so we would call that a.\n\n288\n00:13:18.857 --> 00:13:20.215\nYou said out of bound.\n\n289\n00:13:20.215 --> 00:13:21.075\n&gt;&gt; Out of band.\n\n290\n00:13:21.075 --> 00:13:21.852\n&gt;&gt; Out of band, thank you.\n\n291\n00:13:21.852 --> 00:13:22.514\n&gt;&gt; Yes, okay.\n\n292\n00:13:22.514 --> 00:13:23.258\n&gt;&gt; That's what I was trying to think of.\n\n293\n00:13:23.258 --> 00:13:24.860\nYeah, out-of-band communication strategy.\n\n294\n00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:25.835\n&gt;&gt; So there's a method there.\n\n295\n00:13:25.835 --> 00:13:27.136\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so there's a method for\nkey exchange.\n\n296\n00:13:27.136 --> 00:13:29.810\n&gt;&gt; But would it be more secure?\n\n297\n00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:34.160\nOr has someone performed risk analysis\nto compare the two on something like\n\n298\n00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:39.110\nsending in-band communications\nvia the network?\n\n299\n00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:43.630\nThe Internet, but using some kind of\nwrapper like with asymmetric encryption.\n\n300\n00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:47.410\n&gt;&gt; Well, so we could use hybrid encryption\nwhere we asymmetrically encrypt\n\n301\n00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:51.590\nthe symmetric key and then transfer\nthe key and the message separately, so\n\n302\n00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:55.660\nthat way we are assured that\nthe key cannot be compromised.\n\n303\n00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.370\nAnd that is ultimately where\nwe wind up down the road.\n\n304\n00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:00.040\n&gt;&gt; At some point with most of this,\n\n305\n00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:04.230\nbecause the challenge we have is\nyou can't put a body on a plane and\n\n306\n00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:06.730\nfly them around the world every time\nyou want to transmit a key, right?\n\n307\n00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:07.624\n&gt;&gt; Unless you're Taylor Swift.\n\n308\n00:14:07.624 --> 00:14:08.563\n&gt;&gt; Even if you're Taylor Swift.\n\n309\n00:14:08.563 --> 00:14:10.779\nI mean, you can do it,\nbut the problem becomes,\n\n310\n00:14:10.779 --> 00:14:13.979\nit's highly impractical number one\nbecause there is a delay in time.\n\n311\n00:14:13.979 --> 00:14:17.961\nAnd depending on, so to send\nthe song to him because there's not\n\n312\n00:14:17.961 --> 00:14:22.089\na immediate need like I need an answer\nnow, I could wait two days for\n\n313\n00:14:22.089 --> 00:14:25.285\nyou to listen to it whatever, that's okay.\n\n314\n00:14:25.285 --> 00:14:27.407\nBut how about communication\nthat take place in real time?\n\n315\n00:14:27.407 --> 00:14:27.987\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n316\n00:14:27.987 --> 00:14:31.441\n&gt;&gt; So that's just unfortunatly not\ngonna work really well And there\n\n317\n00:14:31.441 --> 00:14:35.790\nis a limit to time, distance, and money\nthat we could throw at a problem, right?\n\n318\n00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:37.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because at some point,\n\n319\n00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:41.450\nyou run out of the patience and the\nability to spend money on private jets.\n\n320\n00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:45.220\nAnd to send people around\nthe world just to transmit keys\n\n321\n00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.930\nin a business setting\nbecomes highly impractical.\n\n322\n00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:50.790\nSo that you could definitely do what\nyou said, it's a great example.\n\n323\n00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:53.590\nAnd we could do that, but\nit may not be practical for Bob and Alice,\n\n324\n00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:57.190\nbecause I'm thinking Alice's\ncheckbook probably is not at\n\n325\n00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:59.470\nthe same scale that Taylor Swift's may be.\n\n326\n00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:03.990\nSo she's probably not putting the courier\non the jet to send the key over to Bob.\n\n327\n00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:07.500\nBut we could use a hybrid scenario where\nwe use both symmetric and asymmetric,\n\n328\n00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:08.990\nso we'll talk about that in a minute.\n\n329\n00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:13.470\nSo my key exchange story that goes\nwith out of band transmission.\n\n330\n00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:16.890\nSo, I have a friend who has done this for\nmany, many years.\n\n331\n00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:19.490\nI may have mentioned this on one of\nour other shows or on other topics.\n\n332\n00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:23.350\nI think maybe CIS has some of the other\ntopics we talk about cryptography with.\n\n333\n00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:26.340\nI've probably told this story\nat some point in one of those.\n\n334\n00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:29.335\nBut, for many years,\nthis friend of mine has done work,\n\n335\n00:15:29.335 --> 00:15:33.915\nsomething similar to what you talked about\n&gt;&gt; But essentially what he does,\n\n336\n00:15:33.915 --> 00:15:38.041\nis he transfers launch codes and\nsecret codes for\n\n337\n00:15:38.041 --> 00:15:42.971\nthe military and\nthey put him in a situation where he's got\n\n338\n00:15:42.971 --> 00:15:47.105\na group of mongers very\nbig gentlemen with guns.\n\n339\n00:15:47.105 --> 00:15:52.685\nAnd they go into a building, wherever\nthis may be that they do the exchange.\n\n340\n00:15:52.685 --> 00:15:55.385\nHe walks in,\nit's just like in the movies, right.\n\n341\n00:15:55.385 --> 00:15:57.278\nThey give him the briefcase\nwith the shackle.\n\n342\n00:15:57.278 --> 00:15:58.608\nThey put it on his wrist.\n\n343\n00:15:58.608 --> 00:16:00.448\nSo it's a black briefcase.\n\n344\n00:16:00.448 --> 00:16:04.242\nAnd he is given inside this briefcase,\nit used to be years ago,\n\n345\n00:16:04.242 --> 00:16:07.691\nthese were paper based cuz\nthey'd have to be punched in.\n\n346\n00:16:07.691 --> 00:16:12.397\nThey changed to large tapes cuz they used\nto use these massive, mammoth, old style\n\n347\n00:16:12.397 --> 00:16:16.923\ncomputers with the big, what looked like\nquarter inch or half inch tape reels.\n\n348\n00:16:16.923 --> 00:16:20.011\nAnd so he would transfer reels of tape,\nthen eventually,\n\n349\n00:16:20.011 --> 00:16:21.530\nthey went to other methods.\n\n350\n00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:23.420\nYou do this now typically\non thumb drives or\n\n351\n00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.950\nother mechanisms that\nare used to transmit it.\n\n352\n00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:29.270\nBut essentially, he's given a briefcase\nwith codes that have to be transmitted\n\n353\n00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:31.730\nto various secure locations.\n\n354\n00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:36.540\nHe's escorted by these gentlemen, put in\na vehicle, and they drive in a convoy.\n\n355\n00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:38.230\nAnd they go from place to place, and\n\n356\n00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:41.760\nhe goes in and\ngives whoever's on duty these codes.\n\n357\n00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:46.130\nAnd this is, to this day, in some respects\nand certain instances, how this is done.\n\n358\n00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:50.920\nBecause although they can transmit them\nsecurely over the wire on closed networks,\n\n359\n00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.680\nsometimes they are too sensitive\nto be put on the wire.\n\n360\n00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:54.317\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n361\n00:16:54.317 --> 00:16:57.410\nthey need a human involved to\ndo some of these transmissions.\n\n362\n00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:00.490\nSo you could certainly do that, but\nagain, think about the money, the time.\n\n363\n00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:05.280\nThe effort involved with transferring\nthis way with, quote unquote,\n\n364\n00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:08.980\nan analog, an old school way,\noffline, off the grid, so to speak,\n\n365\n00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:10.925\noff the network of having to do this.\n\n366\n00:17:10.925 --> 00:17:13.100\nYou've got five or six security guys,\n\n367\n00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.480\nmaybe two security teams\nwould chase vehicles.\n\n368\n00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:20.200\nThis is complicated stuff,\ncosts time and money, and it's slow.\n\n369\n00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:23.550\nYou gotta send codes to a secure\nlocation outside the country.\n\n370\n00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:26.430\nYou gotta put this guy on\na military transport plane,\n\n371\n00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:28.030\nhave fighter jets escort them.\n\n372\n00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:29.910\nAnd it becomes very complicated, right?\n\n373\n00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:31.541\nSo it's not easy to do.\n\n374\n00:17:31.541 --> 00:17:34.370\nSo it is a method, there's no doubt\nabout it, you can definitely do it.\n\n375\n00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:37.330\nWhat else could Alice do,\nlet's put the diagram back up if we could.\n\n376\n00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:38.940\nSo let's take a look,\nlet's think through this.\n\n377\n00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:42.960\nSo Alice could do this out of band\ntransmission we were talking about, right?\n\n378\n00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:47.230\nShe could engage somebody,\nwhoever it is, as a trusted courier.\n\n379\n00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:49.940\nShe could engage a trusted\nnetwork perhaps,\n\n380\n00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:53.550\nsome sort of secure communication network\nthat may not be the normal Internet or\n\n381\n00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:55.410\nnetwork, like you were talking about.\n\n382\n00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:58.380\nSo maybe she calls Bob up on the phone,\nand says Bob,\n\n383\n00:17:58.380 --> 00:17:59.740\nI want you to write down the key.\n\n384\n00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:02.200\nThat would in theory be\nan out of band transmission\n\n385\n00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:05.450\nbecause it's separate from the network\nthat's being used to send the message.\n\n386\n00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:08.830\nBut could the attacker tap\ninto that communication line?\n\n387\n00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:09.390\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n388\n00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:10.400\n&gt;&gt; In theory, they could, right?\n\n389\n00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.130\nI mean, it wouldn't be unreasonable.\n\n390\n00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:15.570\nWe hear ample evidence of the fact that\nany electronic communication today\n\n391\n00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:17.300\nin theory can be monitored, right?\n\n392\n00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:20.580\nSo even if she does that,\nmaybe we have a problem.\n\n393\n00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.450\nPerhaps she writes the key\ndown as we've said and\n\n394\n00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:25.840\nsomehow tries to securely hand it to Bob.\n\n395\n00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.910\nMaybe she gets up and walks over to Bob,\nmaybe they're in the same office.\n\n396\n00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:31.110\nAnd she gives Bob the key physically,\nright?\n\n397\n00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:33.120\nMuch like we would do\nwith something like this.\n\n398\n00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.750\nI would write it down on a piece of paper,\nand I would hand it,\n\n399\n00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:40.260\nright, over, and maybe that's\nthe way we transmit, back and forth.\n\n400\n00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.040\nBut again, what would happen then?\n\n401\n00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.122\nMaybe you write it down,\n\n402\n00:18:43.122 --> 00:18:46.410\nbut what do you do, if you don't\ndestroy this piece of paper, right?\n\n403\n00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:49.820\nIf it doesn't get removed securely,\nmaybe you leave it laying around.\n\n404\n00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:51.530\nSo could somebody find it?\n\n405\n00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:52.485\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Perhaps they could,\n\n406\n00:18:52.485 --> 00:18:53.950\nright, that could be an issue.\n\n407\n00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:56.380\nAnd then of course,\nthe key has been exposed.\n\n408\n00:18:56.380 --> 00:19:00.220\nWhat if you write it down, you destroy the\noriginal, but leave the paper you wrote it\n\n409\n00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:03.170\ndown on, essentially laying\naround in the same place?\n\n410\n00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:05.093\nThere's all these issues\nassociated with this, right?\n\n411\n00:19:05.093 --> 00:19:09.090\nWe can run through 20 different\nscenarios we wanted from the same place.\n\n412\n00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:09.920\nThe challenge becomes,\n\n413\n00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:13.670\nhow do we securely transmit that\nkey with symmetric encryption?\n\n414\n00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:16.900\nAnd we don't have a lot of easy answers,\nbut let's skip over that for\n\n415\n00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.690\na minute cuz we do have answers,\nwe'll come back to them.\n\n416\n00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:21.850\nBut let's skip over that for a minute,\nlet's just go back to the diagram.\n\n417\n00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:24.250\nLet's assume for a moment that Alice and\n\n418\n00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:27.800\nBob have figured out a way to get\nthat key securely transferred.\n\n419\n00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:32.410\nThe most important thing we've gotta focus\non, and Cherokee brought this out in her\n\n420\n00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:35.590\npart of her answer to the question to\nthe challenge, hey, how do we do this?\n\n421\n00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:39.450\nWhen she said, have we done the risk\nanalysis on such a scenario, too?\n\n422\n00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:42.734\nCan we combine and create a hybrid\nsolution with those symmetric and\n\n423\n00:19:42.734 --> 00:19:43.760\nasymmetric?\n\n424\n00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:49.160\nAnd can we transfer the symmetric key by\nencrypting it asymmetrically to secure it?\n\n425\n00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:53.970\nSo what we wanna understand is that\nregardless how we do this, the one most\n\n426\n00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:58.860\nimportant thing Alice must always be aware\nand do is never transmit the symmetric\n\n427\n00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:04.470\nkey, in this example, with the encrypted\nmessage in the same process flow.\n\n428\n00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:08.330\nBecause if she sends the key with\nthe message, no matter how careful she is,\n\n429\n00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:12.510\nif our bad actor gets a copy\nof that transmission, he or\n\n430\n00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:15.470\nshe has gotten a copy of the key,\nalong with the message.\n\n431\n00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:16.460\nAnd the game's over, right?\n\n432\n00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:17.230\nThey've gotten everything.\n\n433\n00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:20.765\nSo let's put some lines in there maybe\nto represent couple of things we've been\n\n434\n00:20:20.765 --> 00:20:21.510\ntalking about.\n\n435\n00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:25.454\nSo we've been talking about\nthe fact that our attacker, right,\n\n436\n00:20:25.454 --> 00:20:27.972\nmay be able to grab\na hold of that message.\n\n437\n00:20:27.972 --> 00:20:33.823\nAnd this red line will, first one anyway,\nright, will indicate that the attacker\n\n438\n00:20:33.823 --> 00:20:39.270\nmay have the ability to be able to\nintercept in some way that message, right?\n\n439\n00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:44.050\nAnd so if the attacker can get a copy of\nthe message while it's on its way to Bob,\n\n440\n00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:47.940\nthe attacker has, to some degree,\nmade advances, right?\n\n441\n00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:50.070\nThey've gotten a copy of\nthe encrypted message, but\n\n442\n00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:55.780\nbecause it's encrypted without the ability\nto understand and decrypt the encryption.\n\n443\n00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:59.058\nTo essentially break it by either\nusing the key, or brute forcing it, or\n\n444\n00:20:59.058 --> 00:21:01.447\nsomehow finding it,\nthey don't really have much.\n\n445\n00:21:01.447 --> 00:21:03.068\nI mean, they have the encrypted bits, but\n\n446\n00:21:03.068 --> 00:21:05.640\nthey probably don't mean\na lot to the attacker, right?\n\n447\n00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:09.980\nSo, instead of, hey,\ndrinks at 5 after work, the attacker sees\n\n448\n00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:13.682\na random stream of alphanumeric garbage,\nright, that really doesn't mean much,\n\n449\n00:21:13.682 --> 00:21:17.740\nas we've talked about and shown you in\ncertain instances in other episodes.\n\n450\n00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:19.851\nBut and I know you have another red\nline hanging out down there, right?\n\n451\n00:21:19.851 --> 00:21:22.674\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n&gt;&gt; So if we add that second red line in,\n\n452\n00:21:22.674 --> 00:21:26.389\nand we attach one to the key and\nsay somehow the bad actor or\n\n453\n00:21:26.389 --> 00:21:30.494\nattacker is gonna get a copy of\nthe keys we talked about as well,\n\n454\n00:21:30.494 --> 00:21:33.920\nthen all of a sudden,\neverything changes, right?\n\n455\n00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:37.680\nBecause now, the attacker gets\nnot just the message, but\n\n456\n00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:41.560\ngets the ability to understand and\ndecrypt any and all messages that have\n\n457\n00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:46.340\never been sent and ever will be\nsent with this particular key.\n\n458\n00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:48.720\nAnd this is really where\nthe challenge comes in.\n\n459\n00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:53.790\nBecause if we don't find a way to securely\ntransmit that key, all of Alice's\n\n460\n00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:59.530\nefforts are for nothing because not only\nhas she exposed her individual message.\n\n461\n00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:02.589\nBut she's exposed all\nhistorical references and\n\n462\n00:22:02.589 --> 00:22:06.390\nall future use of that key for\nall time until we change the key.\n\n463\n00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:09.724\nAnd while we could certainly transmit and\nretransmit and send and\n\n464\n00:22:09.724 --> 00:22:13.430\nuse different keys every time,\nthis also becomes cumbersome, right?\n\n465\n00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:17.213\nAnd then we have to build an entire\nsystem around this new key management,\n\n466\n00:22:17.213 --> 00:22:18.930\nwe have to keep track of the keys.\n\n467\n00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:20.080\nWe have to use a big enough, so\n\n468\n00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:23.350\nwe talked about,\nin some of our last episodes, key space.\n\n469\n00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:27.600\nThe work factor has to be large enough, so\nthat it's unlikely the attacker can guess\n\n470\n00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.610\nthe key within a reasonable\namount of time.\n\n471\n00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:32.420\nThese are all things\nwe'd have to consider.\n\n472\n00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:34.870\nSo, Alice has her hands full, right,\nshe's got a lot of work here.\n\n473\n00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:37.660\nThis may not be as simple\nas it looks on the surface.\n\n474\n00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:41.310\nSo, we're gonna talk about some of these\nother options and things that she can do.\n\n475\n00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:46.274\nBut ultimately, Alice's challenge is not\nto securely transmit a message to Bob, but\n\n476\n00:22:46.274 --> 00:22:48.580\nto securely transmit a message.\n\n477\n00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:51.710\nAnd the key to decrypt\nthe message separately, but\n\n478\n00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:55.740\nboth have to be done in a secure way that\ndoes not expose either the message or\n\n479\n00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:59.350\nthe key, so that Bob and\nAlice can exchange information.\n\n480\n00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:03.720\nNow we haven't even brought in the fact\nthat when Bob wants to respond, right,\n\n481\n00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:08.190\nBob may use his private key to respond,\nwhich will complicate things further.\n\n482\n00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:10.820\nBecause now Alice has\ngot a copy of his key.\n\n483\n00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:14.590\nAlthough Bob could certainly used\nAlice's private key to respond back,\n\n484\n00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:19.050\nright, if he wanted to, but at some point,\nhe may wanna send his own secure messages.\n\n485\n00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:23.315\nAnd he may have to use his own key, and\nyou can see that as we start to scale this\n\n486\n00:23:23.315 --> 00:23:26.316\nup and add more people into\nthe transmission screen,\n\n487\n00:23:26.316 --> 00:23:31.330\nimagine the distribution list with ten\nusers on it, everybody has a private key.\n\n488\n00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:33.810\nEverybody wants to exchange private keys,\nso they can all send and\n\n489\n00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:35.550\nreceive to each other, right?\n\n490\n00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:39.570\nThat means everybody has to get the ten\nkeys securely sent to them, and\n\n491\n00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:43.910\nthey have to send ten copies of their key\nor nine copies to everybody else, right?\n\n492\n00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:47.460\nI mean, you do the math, this becomes-\n&gt;&gt; An exponential problem.\n\n493\n00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:49.245\n&gt;&gt; A major pain in the ass\nis what it becomes.\n\n494\n00:23:49.245 --> 00:23:52.698\nBut yes, it become an exponential\nproblem because we are creating a web of\n\n495\n00:23:52.698 --> 00:23:53.880\ndependencies, right?\n\n496\n00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.213\nAnd every time we add\nA user into that web.\n\n497\n00:23:56.213 --> 00:24:00.505\nThe exponential growth of the number\nof keys has to be transmitted and\n\n498\n00:24:00.505 --> 00:24:04.510\nsecurely managed goes up and\nthis becomes impossible to scale.\n\n499\n00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:05.780\nThere's no other way to put it.\n\n500\n00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:08.590\nIt becomes impossible to scale very,\nvery quickly.\n\n501\n00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:12.540\nThis is really the significant\nchallenge associated with this.\n\n502\n00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:16.070\nSo the moral of the story is,\nyou don't wanna be Alice, right?\n\n503\n00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:18.990\nCuz Alice has to work really\nhard You don't wanna be Bob,\n\n504\n00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:22.780\ncuz Bob has to in theory also work\nhard if he wants to send his own key.\n\n505\n00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:26.980\nWhat you wanna be is the attacker who\ngets lucky cuz Bob or Alice get careless.\n\n506\n00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:30.140\nAnd you wanna not work hard,\nget the message unencrypted, and\n\n507\n00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:33.230\nthen go sell that information to somebody,\nand then retire.\n\n508\n00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:35.840\nCuz that's what you wanna do,\nyou wanna be the attacker, right?\n\n509\n00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:39.280\nIn these scenarios if you think about\nit being the security professional,\n\n510\n00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.350\nbeing the certified encryption specialist,\n\n511\n00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:45.810\nbeing the IT admin,\nbeing the security overseer, right?\n\n512\n00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:49.540\nThe owner, the custodian, whatever you\nwant to call yourself, there's all these\n\n513\n00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:54.710\ndifferent names we attach to what we do,\nbut being the security person who's gotta\n\n514\n00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:58.350\noversee this and figure this out,\nthis is a lot of work.\n\n515\n00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:01.180\nBeing the attacker,\n&gt;&gt; You're already at a disadvantage.\n\n516\n00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:03.700\n&gt;&gt; Well, you are, but\nbeing the attacker's usually a lot easier.\n\n517\n00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:05.660\nYou just gotta be patient and\nwait for somebody to screw up.\n\n518\n00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:10.130\nBeing the security professional is really\ntough cuz you gotta not only be good but\n\n519\n00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:13.720\nyou gotta make sure you are always\non all the time, always good,\n\n520\n00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.290\nyou can never make a mistake.\n\n521\n00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:16.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I'm getting dizzy going back and\n\n522\n00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:19.630\nforth like this every time I speak,\nyou say something,\n\n523\n00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:22.985\nI'm like wow I gotta stop watching\nthe screen because I'm gonna get dizzy and\n\n524\n00:25:22.985 --> 00:25:24.760\nblack out here seeing it flip back and\nforth.\n\n525\n00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:25.260\n&gt;&gt; We don't need that.\n\n526\n00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:26.430\n&gt;&gt; No we don't want that to happen, right?\n\n527\n00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:29.910\nAll right so we want to keep in\nmind right that this is gonna be\n\n528\n00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:32.420\na significant challenge for\nus with symmetric encryption.\n\n529\n00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:35.450\nWe're just beginning our conversations\naround symmetric cryptography.\n\n530\n00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:38.360\nWe've got a lot of additional thing\nto talk about with you, but we wanted\n\n531\n00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:42.930\nto lay down this conceptual foundation,\nthis visual reference with a diagram.\n\n532\n00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:47.010\nReally help you to understand the pros and\nthe cons, the good and the bad here so\n\n533\n00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:49.570\nthat as we begin to delve\ninto some of these issues and\n\n534\n00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:53.880\nexplain them in upcoming episodes,\nwe can always refer back to this and\n\n535\n00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.370\nyou also have a point of reference\nif you need to review it.\n\n536\n00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:58.210\nAs you're studying, or\nif you want to get ready for the exam.\n\n537\n00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:02.120\nOr you just need to go brush up on it to\nmake sure you can explain it to somebody.\n\n538\n00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.710\nIt's a great way to start\nout the conversation and\n\n539\n00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:07.880\nhelp you to be focused on what we're\ngoing to be doing going forward.\n\n540\n00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.730\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nI think it is a great introduction, but\n\n541\n00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:11.596\nI have a feeling that we\nare not finished yet.\n\n542\n00:26:11.596 --> 00:26:16.089\nSo stay tuned, we do have some more\nECES headed your way but for this show,\n\n543\n00:26:16.089 --> 00:26:18.210\nwe'll go ahead and sign off.\n\n544\n00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:20.410\nRemember, I'm your show host,\nCherokee

you,\nthat's not gonna happen on this episode.\n\n19\n00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.990\nI'm gonna be very technically detailed,\nand spend a lot of time talking to you,\n\n20\n00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.800\nand continuing to talk to you,\nabout symmetric encryption.\n\n21\n00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.270\nCherokee's gonna be\nthe silent one this time.\n\n22\n00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.940\nShe's just gonna use hand signals.\n\n23\n00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.102\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna be miming from now on.\n\n24\n00:00:50.102 --> 00:00:53.321\nAll right, so symmetric encryption,\nas Cherokee was saying,\n\n25\n00:00:53.321 --> 00:00:57.264\nwe have already introduced to you to\nthe concepts of this in our prior episode.\n\n26\n00:00:57.264 --> 00:01:00.710\nIf you haven't watched that, definitely\nrecommend you go back, just take a look.\n\n27\n00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.904\nWe went through, did a nice little\noverview for you, went through,\n\n28\n00:01:03.904 --> 00:01:05.459\nshowed you who Bob and Alice are.\n\n29\n00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.283\nAnd introduced the concept of\nsome extra encryption using them,\n\n30\n00:01:08.283 --> 00:01:11.430\nwalked through a diagram to help\nus understand the challenges.\n\n31\n00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.450\nAnd the value of symmetric encryption,\nbut the significant issue associated\n\n32\n00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.300\nwith private key exchange,\nand how we focus on that.\n\n33\n00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.260\nWhat I wanna do is turn a little bit and\nfocus on the under the hood mechanics,\n\n34\n00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.740\nor the mathematics of encryption for\na few minutes.\n\n35\n00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.615\nNot, perhaps, because we want to scare\nyou off before we get into this.\n\n36\n00:01:29.615 --> 00:01:32.690\nIf everybody is rushing for the door\nright now, and hits the pause button.\n\n37\n00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.630\nWe're not gonna go down\nthe rabbit hole and\n\n38\n00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.060\nstart talking about crazy\nout of this world math.\n\n39\n00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.220\nQuite the opposite, right?\n\n40\n00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.976\nBut what we are gonna do is to show you\nhow to mathematically represent symmetric\n\n41\n00:01:42.976 --> 00:01:45.570\nencryption, which is actually\nkind of interesting.\n\n42\n00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.780\nAnd you and I were talking a bit about\nthis before we came on for the show.\n\n43\n00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.470\nAnd I had given you the formulas,\nwe were just setting them up.\n\n44\n00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.530\nAnd you had an interesting thought process\nfor me about the fact that sometimes\n\n45\n00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.040\ntrying to manage that stuff, put it\nout there and represent it for people.\n\n46\n00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.790\nCan be, not a little scary, but\n\n47\n00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.110\nperhaps the perception is that maybe\nit's a little too technical, right?\n\n48\n00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.020\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; And we talked about the fact that\n\n49\n00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.910\nit's not really technical, it's just\nthat this is what you gotta do and\n\n50\n00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.990\nhow you have to present this information.\n\n51\n00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.340\nIn order to talk through\nthe mathematics of it at this level,\n\n52\n00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.860\nthis is kind of the standard baseline.\n\n53\n00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.250\nAnd you'll see what I\nmean here in a minute.\n\n54\n00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.770\nWe'll put the formulas up,\nthey're very simple.\n\n55\n00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.250\nWe use letters to represent\nall the functions.\n\n56\n00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.070\nAnd we've discussed what they are with\nyou and put them into the notes.\n\n57\n00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.900\nYou understand what they are, but\nas I said to you, this is the baseline.\n\n58\n00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.670\nThis is how we actually\ntalk about this stuff.\n\n59\n00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.020\nAnd it's important for us to know that and\nto understand that, and important for\n\n60\n00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.240\nyou to know that and understand that.\n\n61\n00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.450\nNot because randomly walking down\nthe street or sitting on an airplane.\n\n62\n00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.090\nSomebody may break out and say,\nhey, can you quickly diagram for\n\n63\n00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.760\nme how we mathematically\nrepresent symmetric encryption.\n\n64\n00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.370\nIf they do,\nwalk away quickly in the other direction.\n\n65\n00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.000\nMake no sudden movements, but back away\nquickly, politely, and then run, right?\n\n66\n00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.510\nBecause you're not going to have that\nconversation with somebody in public,\n\n67\n00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.070\nlet's be honest.\n\n68\n00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.600\nIt's not something that most people sit\ndown and talk about on a regular basis.\n\n69\n00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.620\nThis may be the only time you\never see this, unless you study\n\n70\n00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.960\ncryptography in school, or you do this for\na living, or you teach this.\n\n71\n00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.790\nMost people aren't in the habit of talking\nabout the mathematics centered to light\n\n72\n00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:15.830\ncryptography.\n\n73\n00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.460\nIt's not a dinner time around the table,\nfamily time kind of topic.\n\n74\n00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.300\nBut, having said that,\nif you're gonna talk about cryptography,\n\n75\n00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.620\nif you wanna become and\nencryption specialist.\n\n76\n00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.050\nIf you are gonna be asked questions\nabout this at some time, right?\n\n77\n00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.856\nProbably good to understand\nthe foundational elements and\n\n78\n00:03:32.856 --> 00:03:34.771\nbe able to discuss them knowledgeably.\n\n79\n00:03:34.771 --> 00:03:39.260\nIn case you're asked about them or\nsee this formula somewhere, identified for\n\n80\n00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.740\nwhat it is, or formulas.\n\n81\n00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.430\nBecause there are two one for\nencryption, one for decryption.\n\n82\n00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.090\nWe wanna make sure you\nunderstand how that works.\n\n83\n00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.223\nSo, if we could please,\nlet's just take a look real quick and\n\n84\n00:03:48.223 --> 00:03:49.743\nit's amazing when I do that.\n\n85\n00:03:49.743 --> 00:03:51.043\nI plugged my finger in last night.\n\n86\n00:03:51.043 --> 00:03:52.094\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I charged it up so\n\n87\n00:03:52.094 --> 00:03:53.880\nthat it would be ready to go.\n\n88\n00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.580\nAnd when I do that it shows up\njust like that, which is awesome.\n\n89\n00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.420\nGreat job, thank you very much.\n\n90\n00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.030\nSo symmetric encryption\nexpressed mathematically.\n\n91\n00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.020\nLet's talk through this, let me actually\njust scroll down here like one click.\n\n92\n00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.790\nJust to make sure it's little bit\neasier to get right on the screen there\n\n93\n00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.110\nwhile we're talking.\n\n94\n00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.474\nAnd so the first formula up\nat the top there on the left,\n\n95\n00:04:15.474 --> 00:04:23.069\nsymmetric encryption expressed\nmathematically as C = E(k,p), right?\n\n96\n00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:26.220\nAnd so let's break down what we have,\nC as you could see there in the notes,\n\n97\n00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.940\nis cipher text.\n\n98\n00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.950\nWe are encrypting right?\n\n99\n00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.230\nSo we're gonna create encrypted text.\n\n100\n00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.556\nCipher text remembers the output, so what\nis essentially cipher text made up of?\n\n101\n00:04:35.556 --> 00:04:41.592\nIs what we are saying with this particular\nformula, cipher text is comprised of or\n\n102\n00:04:41.592 --> 00:04:46.642\nequal to an encryption function E\nwith a key, small lower case k.\n\n103\n00:04:46.642 --> 00:04:52.460\nAnd plaintext, small, lower case p being\npassed as parameters through a algorithm.\n\n104\n00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.320\nOr in this case through a cryptosystem\nthat allows us to create the encrypted\n\n105\n00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.056\ncipher text.\n\n106\n00:04:57.056 --> 00:05:01.403\nSo cipher text is represented as being the\nencryption function made up of the key and\n\n107\n00:05:01.403 --> 00:05:03.620\nthe plaintext combined together.\n\n108\n00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.850\nOperating through the cryptosystems,\n\n109\n00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.430\nspecifically the algorithm\nportion of the cryptosystem.\n\n110\n00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.400\nAnd that's the encryption function that\nthen allows us to create cipher text.\n\n111\n00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.590\nWhen we look at decryption,\nright, next one down.\n\n112\n00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.670\nSo we flip it, essentially, and\n\n113\n00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:22.008\nyou could see p has been brought\noutside to equal plaintext, right?\n\n114\n00:05:22.008 --> 00:05:26.370\nAnd you could see that inside we've\nsubstituted where the p would have been.\n\n115\n00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.680\nWe've substituted the C,\nto cipher text, right?\n\n116\n00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.380\nSo all we've got to swap two items around.\n\n117\n00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.210\nBut by flipping those two,\nwe've created the exact reverse function\n\n118\n00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.180\nthat allows us to run\nthis process backwards.\n\n119\n00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.220\nTaking the decryption function and\ndiagramming it out, or\n\n120\n00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.740\nrepresenting it in a formula.\n\n121\n00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.790\nSo we can take cipher text and\ntranslate it back into plaintext.\n\n122\n00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.060\nBecause if we can't do that, then,\nunfortunately, it's a very short trip,\n\n123\n00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.440\nright, we can't do too much.\n\n124\n00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.176\nSo we have P here, capital P\nrepresenting now our plaintext outside.\n\n125\n00:05:57.176 --> 00:05:58.838\nAnd what is plaintext equal to?\n\n126\n00:05:58.838 --> 00:06:02.479\nIt's equal to the encryption\nfunction being run with the key and\n\n127\n00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:03.510\nthe cipher text.\n\n128\n00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.620\nAnd applying the key to the cipher text,\nrunning that process through\n\n129\n00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.670\nthe algorithm, the encryption function,\npart of the cryptosystem.\n\n130\n00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:11.490\nWill then yield,\n\n131\n00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.140\nif it's done correctly, you have\nthe right key, will yield the plaintext.\n\n132\n00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.060\nSo this is the two ways we represent\nthe functions, the encrypt and\n\n133\n00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.000\nthe decrypt function mathematically.\n\n134\n00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.710\nAs I said, not complicated math, right?\n\n135\n00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.760\nWe're not talking about logarithms and\ncrazy formulas or\n\n136\n00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.900\nanything that's really hard to follow.\n\n137\n00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.340\nAll you need to do is look at it for\na minute, kind of catch your breath.\n\n138\n00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.990\nRead through the logic of what each\ncharacter or letter represents.\n\n139\n00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:41.860\nAnd it is an exact representation of what\nwe do done in a very simplistic way.\n\n140\n00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.170\nBut this is how you would see this\nnotated, if you looked at any text on\n\n141\n00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:49.350\ncryptography, book of any kind,\nanything that's an academic or\n\n142\n00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:53.040\njust a general book that talks about this,\nexplains the mathematics.\n\n143\n00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.870\nThese are the beginning formulas you will\nbegin to see, or at least start to see.\n\n144\n00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.860\nYou would get more complicated\nstuff beyond this,\n\n145\n00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.310\nbut we're culling that out and\nfiltering that out at this point, right?\n\n146\n00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.390\nWe want to get you excited\nabout the concept,\n\n147\n00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.210\nnot scare you off before we\ngo through the whole process.\n\n148\n00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:08.130\nSo, we've got both the encrypt and\ndecrypt functions.\n\n149\n00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:09.770\nMake sure you're comfortable with them,\n\n150\n00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.220\njust want to make sure we\nunderstand how they work.\n\n151\n00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.880\nAnd obviously plugging in here,\nwe would take the variables, right?\n\n152\n00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.460\nWe would actually take\nour plaintext stream.\n\n153\n00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.680\nWe would take our encryption function,\n\n154\n00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.970\nthat will be our algorithm\nas part of the cryptosystem.\n\n155\n00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:25.834\nWe would take our key, whatever that is,\nour public or private key, one or both,\n\n156\n00:07:25.834 --> 00:07:27.470\nand we would have our cipher text.\n\n157\n00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.780\nWe would be plugging in these pieces.\n\n158\n00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:33.220\nIn some cases plaintext would be\nsomething simple, the word decryption,\n\n159\n00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.310\nright up there.\n\n160\n00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.110\nCould be this entire set of notes.\n\n161\n00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:39.850\nMaybe, I don't know, three or four pages\nworth of stuff that we put together for\n\n162\n00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:40.730\nyou for show notes.\n\n163\n00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:43.910\nWhatever it is, all of that could be\nthe plaintext, wouldn't really matter.\n\n164\n00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:45.424\nAnd then, of course the output,\n\n165\n00:07:45.424 --> 00:07:49.110\nthe cipher text on the flip side would be\nwhatever we get out once we're through.\n\n166\n00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:51.321\nSo these will be items that are,\nessentially,\n\n167\n00:07:51.321 --> 00:07:52.825\nto become place holders for us.\n\n168\n00:07:52.825 --> 00:07:56.239\nWe would slot in the appropriate\ninformation as we go.\n\n169\n00:07:56.239 --> 00:07:59.439\nJust wanna make sure we have a sense of\nthat and we're comfortable with this,\n\n170\n00:07:59.439 --> 00:08:01.040\nhave an idea of how these work.\n\n171\n00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.090\nRemember, we're not asking\nyou to run these formulas.\n\n172\n00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:06.300\nWe're not asking you to use them directly.\n\n173\n00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.990\nWe're explaining what they are used for.\n\n174\n00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:12.140\nCould you see them at some point\nin a word problem, in a scenario,\n\n175\n00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.330\ncould you be asked about\na portion of them in the future?\n\n176\n00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.040\nNo doubt that could be the case.\n\n177\n00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:21.333\nObviously, your responsibility to figure\nout how to best use this information and\n\n178\n00:08:21.333 --> 00:08:22.079\nput it to use.\n\n179\n00:08:22.079 --> 00:08:24.959\nBut keep in mind that this is\nthe foundational elements,\n\n180\n00:08:24.959 --> 00:08:28.439\nor the foundational elements,\nto form the basis mathematically for\n\n181\n00:08:28.439 --> 00:08:31.923\nall of the cryptosystems,\nall the cryptography that we talk about.\n\n182\n00:08:31.923 --> 00:08:35.881\nBecause this is the baseline assumption\nthat we operate from with regards to how\n\n183\n00:08:35.881 --> 00:08:37.680\nwe encrypt and decrypt.\n\n184\n00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.328\nThe complexity of additional algorithms,\nmultiple rounds,\n\n185\n00:08:41.328 --> 00:08:45.658\nall the things we go through there,\nare gonna get added in as a subcontext or\n\n186\n00:08:45.658 --> 00:08:50.222\nthe substrata to this, as we build\ncomplexity around the encryption system.\n\n187\n00:08:50.222 --> 00:08:53.323\nBut this is just a very high level summary\nof what we would be doing, just so\n\n188\n00:08:53.323 --> 00:08:54.685\nwe're comfortable with that.\n\n189\n00:08:54.685 --> 00:08:55.690\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n190\n00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:58.780\n&gt;&gt; You were excited about the idea\nof learning more about this and\n\n191\n00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.220\ntalking about it, so\nthoughts, comments questions?\n\n192\n00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:04.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm just sitting here thinking\nabout it is very basic rudimentary.\n\n193\n00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:06.200\nYou're at my level right now, Adam.\n\n194\n00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:10.130\nWhen I first got Bruce Schneier,\nI got that book over that's on my desk,\n\n195\n00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:10.740\nmaybe I'll bring it in.\n\n196\n00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:11.860\n&gt;&gt; Applied Cryptography.\n\n197\n00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:13.720\n&gt;&gt; Applied Cryptography.\n\n198\n00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.240\nI think it's really cool because\nhe publishes those functions,\n\n199\n00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.510\nhe publishes the source code.\n\n200\n00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:21.345\nMaybe for another show we can bring it\nin and show what some of those advanced\n\n201\n00:09:21.345 --> 00:09:23.955\nalgorithms look like when we start\ntalking about them more in depth,\n\n202\n00:09:23.955 --> 00:09:25.810\nwe could show it on the hover cam,\nor something.\n\n203\n00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:28.631\nBecause my first thought was\nI cracked this book open,\n\n204\n00:09:28.631 --> 00:09:33.043\nI'd no clue what I was getting into, and I\nwasn't joking when I almost went into cry,\n\n205\n00:09:33.043 --> 00:09:35.886\nbecause I thought wow,\npeople are really this smart.\n\n206\n00:09:35.886 --> 00:09:39.433\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's not that people are smart or\n\n207\n00:09:39.433 --> 00:09:40.160\nnot smart.\n\n208\n00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.410\nBecause people certainly\nare what they are.\n\n209\n00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:46.990\nBut the idea is that, you got some people\nthat really, this is their passion.\n\n210\n00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:47.660\nThis is what they do.\n\n211\n00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.170\nBruce, for instance,\nPeter Schneier among them.\n\n212\n00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:53.320\nAnd you'll hear me refer to him in some of\nthe later episodes because we talk about\n\n213\n00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.170\nsome of the algorithms that he's been\nresponsible for: blowfish, twofish.\n\n214\n00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:01.472\nHe's been involved in algorithms creation\nfor many decades as a mathematicion-\n\n215\n00:10:01.472 --> 00:10:02.379\n&gt;&gt; Sure, from the beginning\n\n216\n00:10:02.379 --> 00:10:03.500\n&gt;&gt; From the top firm.\n\n217\n00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:07.904\nAnd is very well known in our field,\ncontinues to write to this day,\n\n218\n00:10:07.904 --> 00:10:10.376\nhas a blog many, many people follow,\n\n219\n00:10:10.376 --> 00:10:14.107\nis commenting all the time on\ngoing ons in our community.\n\n220\n00:10:14.107 --> 00:10:15.727\nBoth from the good, and the bad, and\n\n221\n00:10:15.727 --> 00:10:18.990\nthe ugly perspective about what he\nsees out in there in the world.\n\n222\n00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:22.600\nVery well respected in our community and\nworldwide as an IT and\n\n223\n00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.980\nsecurity professional.\n\n224\n00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:27.220\nAmong many others, we talked about\nsome that are no longer with us.\n\n225\n00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.460\nSome that are still here\ndoing this kind of work.\n\n226\n00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.060\nAnd there's many,\nmany people that do this.\n\n227\n00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:34.950\nBut the commonality we'll\nfind among most of them\n\n228\n00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:38.210\nis that they have that mathematical,\nthat engineering, that science background.\n\n229\n00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:42.646\nMost of these people that have contributed\nto this particular area, men and women,\n\n230\n00:10:42.646 --> 00:10:45.706\nand there have been many of both,\nare first and foremost,\n\n231\n00:10:45.706 --> 00:10:48.597\nprobably more than anything else,\nmathematicians.\n\n232\n00:10:48.597 --> 00:10:50.966\nBecause that's really where\nthe background comes from.\n\n233\n00:10:50.966 --> 00:10:55.059\nAnd they have that training formally,\ninformally, study in those fields, apply\n\n234\n00:10:55.059 --> 00:10:59.156\nthat knowledge, either through computer\nengineering or science based studies.\n\n235\n00:10:59.156 --> 00:11:01.877\nBut they tend to come from those\nbackgrounds because that's\n\n236\n00:11:01.877 --> 00:11:02.900\nthe mindset you need.\n\n237\n00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:06.460\nYou need to have kind of\nthat mathematical wiring and\n\n238\n00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:11.000\ncapability to envision an understand the\nmathematics that make our world possible.\n\n239\n00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:11.860\nNot me, by the way.\n\n240\n00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:15.720\nThat's why you don't see my name\nattached to any those algorithms, right.\n\n241\n00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.430\nJust I'm not wired that way.\n\n242\n00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:19.265\nI struggle-\n&gt;&gt; Ditto.\n\n243\n00:11:19.265 --> 00:11:21.429\n&gt;&gt; To get two plus two to\nequal four on a regular basis.\n\n244\n00:11:21.429 --> 00:11:23.091\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I'm usually good for\n\n245\n00:11:23.091 --> 00:11:26.510\ntwo plus two not equalling four at\nleast one or two of those rounds.\n\n246\n00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:30.429\nAnd so it's funny because, many years ago\nwhen I first started out, and you and\n\n247\n00:11:30.429 --> 00:11:33.704\nI were chatting a little bit over\nthe last couple days about, hey,\n\n248\n00:11:33.704 --> 00:11:34.836\nyou did this and this.\n\n249\n00:11:34.836 --> 00:11:35.755\nThis is kind of cool.\n\n250\n00:11:35.755 --> 00:11:36.490\nWhen you were here,\n\n251\n00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:41.610\nliving here doing this and I come from\na very kind of crazy, storied background.\n\n252\n00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:43.370\nWe're not gonna go into all that now but\n\n253\n00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:46.060\none of the things I wanted to do when I\nwas really young and I was first starting\n\n254\n00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:48.680\nout thinking about what I wanted to do\nhad nothing to do with this, by the way.\n\n255\n00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.120\nThis was like a happy accident.\n\n256\n00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.790\nI did not set out to do what I do for\na living, not even close.\n\n257\n00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:56.370\nI'd actually wanted to be\na doctor of all things.\n\n258\n00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:59.670\nI wanted to be a trauma surgeon and\nI went through early\n\n259\n00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:04.180\nstages of college thinking okay this is\nfor me Until I ran into the reality of, so\n\n260\n00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.460\nyou basically spend ten years doing\nnothing but match and science.\n\n261\n00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:08.770\nAnd the science part wasn't hard.\n\n262\n00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:12.160\nI did chemistry, biology,\nphysics, biochem, organic.\n\n263\n00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.170\nI was able to get through most of that,\nbut\n\n264\n00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:16.790\nit was the math that was just,\nthat was it.\n\n265\n00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:21.510\nAt that point I smarted up, as they say,\nand I realized it was not for me.\n\n266\n00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:23.640\nAnd then I went and did a total 180 and\n\n267\n00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:28.560\nwent into a field that you would think\nNot being in IT, not being in security,\n\n268\n00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.540\nif you look at it from the outside,\nyou don't know much about it.\n\n269\n00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:34.720\nYou look at it, people say, but\nyou gotta be doing math like all the time.\n\n270\n00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.390\nIt's computers, isn't that what you do?\n\n271\n00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:38.500\nAnd I said, farthest thing from it.\n\n272\n00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.160\nI never do math, right.\n\n273\n00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.590\nI mean the closest I get to math is\nsubnetting, and I can do that in my head.\n\n274\n00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:44.570\nI have no trouble with that.\n\n275\n00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:48.500\nI don't use, you can't use the online\ncalculators, that kind of stuff I don't\n\n276\n00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:52.310\nneed to because I do it all the time, and\nI teach and I work with it all the time\n\n277\n00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:54.970\nfor my customers, so\nI know it well enough that I could do it.\n\n278\n00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:57.400\nBut aside from that, that's about it.\n\n279\n00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.890\nI don't use math for\n\n280\n00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:04.060\nalmost anything I do, and I do a lot of\nthis kind of stuff on a regular basis.\n\n281\n00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:08.940\nIt's one of those myths and\nlegends about our Our chosen profession.\n\n282\n00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:11.790\nThere certainly is a lot of math\nin what we do, don't get me wrong.\n\n283\n00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:14.950\nBut you don't tend to have to interact\nwith it directly, as we've been kinda\n\n284\n00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:18.110\nhinting at and even directly come out and\nsaid a couple times in a few episodes.\n\n285\n00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:20.330\nBecause a lot of the times\nthe software extracts it now, right?\n\n286\n00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:24.400\nSo when you're doing encryption, or\ndecryption, you don't have to really,\n\n287\n00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.255\nI mean you should, let me be clear.\n\n288\n00:13:26.255 --> 00:13:28.090\nLet me be Crystal clear about this.\n\n289\n00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:31.730\nYou should understand the mechanics\nof the algorithms you're using\n\n290\n00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:34.050\nto properly apply them and\nuse them securely.\n\n291\n00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:35.740\nThere is no doubt about that, but\n\n292\n00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:40.310\nhaving said that most average users don't\ntake the time and not do they really need\n\n293\n00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:43.720\nto to understand how to encrypt\nthe message when they send via email.\n\n294\n00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.262\nThey don't understand.\n\n295\n00:13:44.262 --> 00:13:48.161\nThey just hit a button and it goes,\nand in theory everything works.\n\n296\n00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:51.377\nIt's the security professional,\nthe IT professional,\n\n297\n00:13:51.377 --> 00:13:55.577\nthe encryption specialist that needs\nto go that next several layers down and\n\n298\n00:13:55.577 --> 00:13:57.679\nreally understand the mathematics,\n\n299\n00:13:57.679 --> 00:14:01.637\nso we can properly oversee,\napply governance, risk and compliance.\n\n300\n00:14:01.637 --> 00:14:05.869\nAnd we can make sure we are and ensure\nthat we are, and all of those around us\n\n301\n00:14:05.869 --> 00:14:10.060\nthat we are responsible for operating\nsecurely and safely at all times.\n\n302\n00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.437\nBut it's rare that people\nreally go into this, right.\n\n303\n00:14:12.437 --> 00:14:15.228\nSo you're in good company because\nthe majority of the world is\n\n304\n00:14:15.228 --> 00:14:16.254\nright there with you.\n\n305\n00:14:16.254 --> 00:14:19.527\nBecause, most people, you would talk to\nthem about this, they just don't really\n\n306\n00:14:19.527 --> 00:14:22.970\nunderstand it at anything other than\na very basic, rudimentary level either.\n\n307\n00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:24.250\nAnd there's nothing wrong with that.\n\n308\n00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:29.130\nBy the way, as I said, you can operate\nsafely and securely, for the most part.\n\n309\n00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:32.940\nBecause the software these days is\ndesigned to eliminate a lot of that\n\n310\n00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:37.350\ncomplexity and make it easy for you to\ndo this in a secure and safe way, but\n\n311\n00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:41.380\nyou then have to have talented,\ntrained and dedicated professionals.\n\n312\n00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:46.230\nWomen, and men and lots of both hopefully\nthat are overseeing these systems, right?\n\n313\n00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:50.209\nManaging them and doing this on our\nbehalf, so that way we understand that\n\n314\n00:14:50.209 --> 00:14:54.270\nwe are able to sleep well at night,\nas I said with Alice on our last episode.\n\n315\n00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:56.642\nBecause Alice knows her\nkey is gonna be protected,\n\n316\n00:14:56.642 --> 00:14:58.860\nbecause she's taking the right steps.\n\n317\n00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:01.830\nShe has policies that she's been given,\nprocedures, and\n\n318\n00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:03.930\nguidelines that she's implementing and\nusing.\n\n319\n00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:07.560\nBecause people like myself,\nlike Cherokee, like all of you, have\n\n320\n00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.920\nbeen trained to do this the right way,\nand are using our skills to oversee and\n\n321\n00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:13.910\nto help manage, and\nto implement a secure process.\n\n322\n00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:15.720\nThat becomes very important.\n\n323\n00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.020\nLet's talk about what that secure\nprocess looks like a little bit.\n\n324\n00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.760\nWe went through some of our\nvocabulary in the prior episodes.\n\n325\n00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.290\nWe've talked about the reasons for you.\n\n326\n00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:24.670\nGo back and take a look at that.\n\n327\n00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:29.070\nSome of the terminology we use there,\noldies but goodies, diffusion, and\n\n328\n00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:29.620\nconfusion.\n\n329\n00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:33.000\nThere was a lot of that\naround our discussion,\n\n330\n00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.100\nboth diffusion of knowledge and\nconfusion around to understand it.\n\n331\n00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:38.530\nBut we defined those terms for\nyou, all kidding aside.\n\n332\n00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:41.530\nWe talked about substitution and\npermutation and transposition.\n\n333\n00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:43.210\nYou're gonna see those come back up again.\n\n334\n00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:47.809\nWe talked about the avalanche effect as\nwell and kind of the derivative of that\n\n335\n00:15:47.809 --> 00:15:51.788\nbeing a newer updated version or\ntake on the concept of diffusion.\n\n336\n00:15:51.788 --> 00:15:55.360\nBut I also mentioned in that discussion as\nyou had been very quick on the keyboard\n\n337\n00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.706\nwhile we were discussing that And\nyou had gone out and\n\n338\n00:15:57.706 --> 00:16:01.736\nsaid, let me quickly check on that and you\nthrew Claude Shannon's name in the ring.\n\n339\n00:16:01.736 --> 00:16:05.267\nAnd said, Shannon was the guy who actually\ncame up with this idea of the avalanche\n\n340\n00:16:05.267 --> 00:16:06.980\neffect when I was explaining it.\n\n341\n00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:07.920\nAnd I said, absolutely right.\n\n342\n00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:11.065\nAnd I went into a little bit of the\nhistory and the background on Shannon and\n\n343\n00:16:11.065 --> 00:16:11.941\nwhere he came from.\n\n344\n00:16:11.941 --> 00:16:16.076\nHe could actually been the one\nwho in the late 1940s,\n\n345\n00:16:16.076 --> 00:16:22.780\nalmost 1950 it was 1949, writes a seminal\narticle in the Bell Systems Journal.\n\n346\n00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:27.420\nWhich as in Bell Laboratories as in\nMa Bell as in what AT&amp;T is these days, but\n\n347\n00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:32.720\nback in the day, wrote a very\nfamous paper about the concepts of\n\n348\n00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.630\ncommunication theory of secrecy systems.\n\n349\n00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:38.060\nThat was the actual name of the article\ncommunications theory of secrecy systems.\n\n350\n00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:42.580\nSure I get that correct, seminal\nwork at the time for decades after,\n\n351\n00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:44.980\nstill to this day, is cited and\nquoted all the time.\n\n352\n00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:49.390\nHe lays down the foundational elements and\nthought processes in this article\n\n353\n00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:52.530\nthat lead to the founding of what I\ntalked about, which is information theory\n\n354\n00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:56.400\nas a science that we, to this day,\nstudy and continue to pursue.\n\n355\n00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.950\nAnd along with Warren Weaver, the guy's\nname I could not remember when we talked\n\n356\n00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:03.220\nabout it, but Shannon partners up\nwith a gentleman named Warren Weaver.\n\n357\n00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:06.560\nAbout a year or\ntwo later publishes a book called\n\n358\n00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:09.830\nMathematical Theory of Communication,\nagain another seminal work.\n\n359\n00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:13.373\nIf you study this area formally,\nyou go to college and go through and\n\n360\n00:17:13.373 --> 00:17:17.369\nlearn about cryptography, and\nsecurity engineering, things like this.\n\n361\n00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:20.585\nYou read these works,\nthese are foundational works in our study,\n\n362\n00:17:20.585 --> 00:17:22.120\nin our area of knowledge.\n\n363\n00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:25.580\nMathematical Theory of Communication\ncomes out, jointly published by them, and\n\n364\n00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:29.520\nit leads to the founding of\nInformation Theory as a science and\n\n365\n00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.940\na thought process that\nwe continue to pursue.\n\n366\n00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:35.450\nBut concepts that come out of\nInformation Theory are confusion,\n\n367\n00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:39.340\nare diffusion, and\nthen this idea is then built on by\n\n368\n00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:43.110\nanother seminal figure in our\nhistory called Horst Feistel.\n\n369\n00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:44.345\nIt's fun to say his name.\n\n370\n00:17:44.345 --> 00:17:46.101\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's say it three times fast,\n\n371\n00:17:46.101 --> 00:17:47.688\nstanding on one leg, right?\n\n372\n00:17:47.688 --> 00:17:51.590\nBut Horst Feistel is another huge,\n\n373\n00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:55.770\nhuge person in the, kind of,\nhistory of all of this.\n\n374\n00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:59.090\nAnd he builds on this\nconcept that Shannon laid out\n\n375\n00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:02.170\nalong with Weaver with\nregards to diffusion.\n\n376\n00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:04.750\nThat we've talked about and comes up\nwith this idea that I talked about on\n\n377\n00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.080\nthe vocabulary as well\nof the avalanche effect.\n\n378\n00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.550\nAnd we had written about that, or\nrather we had talked about that, you were\n\n379\n00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:14.060\nexplaining a little bit about that in\nthe beginning as I was talking through it.\n\n380\n00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:17.007\nBut the idea of information\ntheory is also important for\n\n381\n00:18:17.007 --> 00:18:19.713\nus to be aware of where it comes from,\nthe history.\n\n382\n00:18:19.713 --> 00:18:23.152\nAnd every so often we sprinkle some\nof these names in history in for\n\n383\n00:18:23.152 --> 00:18:25.277\nyou around these ciphers for instance,\n\n384\n00:18:25.277 --> 00:18:30.010\nwhen we talked about the Vigenere cipher\nand the Playfair cipher in prior episodes.\n\n385\n00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:30.910\nIn this area and\n\n386\n00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:34.210\nin some of the others you'll see as we\ncrank through some of the algorithms for\n\n387\n00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:37.970\nciphers that are associated with\nsymmetric, both stream and block.\n\n388\n00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:42.155\nFunctions in later episodes that will be\ncoming up and we'll talk about them and\n\n389\n00:18:42.155 --> 00:18:44.850\nwho was behind them and\nmaybe more than one person.\n\n390\n00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:47.170\nIn many cases these days,\nit's a joint effort.\n\n391\n00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:49.850\nYou may have as many as five,\nor six, or seven people\n\n392\n00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:53.460\nthat are involved in the creation\nof one or more of these algorithms.\n\n393\n00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:57.820\nIt's important for you to know this not\nbecause we're playing trivia with you, but\n\n394\n00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:00.020\nyou may, number one,\nhave to answer questions about this.\n\n395\n00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:03.970\nSo you may wanna know who the key\nfigures are that created these things.\n\n396\n00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:05.440\nThat may be important for you to know.\n\n397\n00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:10.460\nIn addition, as I said, I believe\nat least from my way of thinking,\n\n398\n00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:14.300\nfrom the time that I\ncome from when I came up.\n\n399\n00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.800\nThere wasn't,\nas I've talked about in other shows and\n\n400\n00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:20.420\nother episodes, there weren't as\nmany resources as there are today.\n\n401\n00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:24.130\nWhen I wanted to learn something\nback in the by-gone era when I\n\n402\n00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:27.290\nwent to school when I was learning\nabout a lot of the stuff.\n\n403\n00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:30.297\nI had to go to libraries and\nI have to look stuff up on books.\n\n404\n00:19:30.297 --> 00:19:33.805\nAnd I had to go and read about it because\nthere was no Internet the way there is\n\n405\n00:19:33.805 --> 00:19:37.190\ntoday in world wide web and\ncertainly Google didn't exist.\n\n406\n00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:39.620\nAnd all the things we have and\ntake for granted today,\n\n407\n00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.402\nwhere we could easily ask a question and\n\n408\n00:19:41.402 --> 00:19:45.301\nyou could get the answer almost before you\nget the question out of your mouth, right?\n\n409\n00:19:45.301 --> 00:19:49.620\nIt just didn't work that way and so I come\nfrom a background where if I wanted to\n\n410\n00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:53.600\nknow it I had to be passionate about\nI had to go out a figure it out.\n\n411\n00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.215\nAnd I had to remember it because\nif I didn't remember it I had to\n\n412\n00:19:56.215 --> 00:19:58.999\ngo through that whole process to\nlook it up again when I wanted it.\n\n413\n00:19:58.999 --> 00:20:01.700\nAnd it wasn't easy to go look stuff up.\n\n414\n00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:05.036\nIt wasn't like you sat at home and\njust, the information came to you.\n\n415\n00:20:05.036 --> 00:20:08.250\nYou went to a,\nprobably an academic library cuz your\n\n416\n00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:10.300\nneighborhood library didn't\nhave a lot of this stuff,\n\n417\n00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:14.565\nnot about encryption anyway and not\nabout these academic articles and books.\n\n418\n00:20:14.565 --> 00:20:17.132\nAnd you had to go look it up in\na college or university library and\n\n419\n00:20:17.132 --> 00:20:19.408\nthey may not even had it\ndepending on how big they were and\n\n420\n00:20:19.408 --> 00:20:21.653\nwhat kind of school they were and\nwhat they focused on.\n\n421\n00:20:21.653 --> 00:20:24.281\nAnd you may have had requested or\nwait a few weeks for\n\n422\n00:20:24.281 --> 00:20:27.835\nsomeone to snail mail it over to\nyou to get a copy of it, right?\n\n423\n00:20:27.835 --> 00:20:30.500\nAnd heaven help you if you had\nto look it up on microfiche if\n\n424\n00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.360\nyou don't know what that is,\nGoogle that, right?\n\n425\n00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:37.460\nSo the idea is that when I had to learn\nthis stuff, I had to learn it and\n\n426\n00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:38.130\nremember it.\n\n427\n00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:41.830\nSo part of that was learning about\nthe history of who these people were,\n\n428\n00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:45.350\ntheir contributions, talked about\nAllan Turing in a prior episode.\n\n429\n00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:49.430\nTalked about a lot of these key figures,\nbecause without knowing who they are,\n\n430\n00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:51.990\nyou really have no way of\nattributing these ideas to people.\n\n431\n00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.826\nAnd they are real ideas.\n\n432\n00:20:52.826 --> 00:20:53.830\nThey came from real people.\n\n433\n00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:58.200\nIt's really important for\nus as practitioners in these fields\n\n434\n00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:00.320\nto give credit to the people\nwho came before us.\n\n435\n00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:04.150\nNot just take for granted what they've\ndone and assume it was always that way.\n\n436\n00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:05.850\nBecause it wasn't always this way.\n\n437\n00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:10.570\nAnd there was a huge amount of history as\nwe've talked about, thousands of years,\n\n438\n00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:14.880\nwhere we were communicating securely, but\nusing none of this kind of stuff, right?\n\n439\n00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.010\nThis is all relatively modern and new.\n\n440\n00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:19.423\nAnd so it is important for\nus to look back every so often and\n\n441\n00:21:19.423 --> 00:21:22.845\nunderstand the history and where we're\ncoming from to ensure that we really give\n\n442\n00:21:22.845 --> 00:21:25.544\ncredit to the people that whose\nshoulders we're standing on.\n\n443\n00:21:25.544 --> 00:21:30.050\nAnd in many cases are the brains behind\nthe operation when we click the button.\n\n444\n00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:31.347\nCuz it's easy to click the button,\n\n445\n00:21:31.347 --> 00:21:33.777\nit's hard to understand what\nclicking the button actually does.\n\n446\n00:21:33.777 --> 00:21:37.322\nAnd it's harder to understand what had to\nhappen before we could click the button\n\n447\n00:21:37.322 --> 00:21:40.310\nfor the button to be clicked to\nactually work the right way.\n\n448\n00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:43.000\nBecause there was a lot\nof prior technology and\n\n449\n00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.540\nknowledge that's gone through many\niterations for us to get to this point.\n\n450\n00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:49.650\nWe talked a lot about Kerckhoffs,\nGus Kerckhoffs, Kerckhoffs' principle.\n\n451\n00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:51.770\nYou've heard me in several\nepisodes talk about it.\n\n452\n00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:56.036\nJust reminding you of who he is,\nwhere he comes from, why he's important.\n\n453\n00:21:56.036 --> 00:22:00.991\n1883 is where Kerckhoffs formulates or\nproposes that a cryptosystem should be\n\n454\n00:22:00.991 --> 00:22:05.377\nsecure, even if all the elements of\nthe system could be exposed or known,\n\n455\n00:22:05.377 --> 00:22:06.880\nexcept the key, right?\n\n456\n00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:10.220\nKeep the private key secure\nKerckhoffs essentially said, right?\n\n457\n00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.234\nThen everything else is okay.\n\n458\n00:22:12.234 --> 00:22:14.441\nGive it all away, but\nkeep that key secure.\n\n459\n00:22:14.441 --> 00:22:15.111\nWhere's our key?\n\n460\n00:22:15.111 --> 00:22:15.723\nYou got our key?\n\n461\n00:22:15.723 --> 00:22:17.430\n&gt;&gt; Right here.\n&gt;&gt; From our prior episode, right?\n\n462\n00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:19.527\n&gt;&gt; Woo hoo.\n&gt;&gt; There's our private key, right so\n\n463\n00:22:19.527 --> 00:22:23.410\nthe key master like Gozer the Gozerian\nfrom Ghost Busters the key master.\n\n464\n00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:25.711\nThere's your movie reference.\nYou ever see the original Ghost Busters?\n\n465\n00:22:25.711 --> 00:22:27.220\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Don't tell me the new one.\n\n466\n00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:27.918\n&gt;&gt; No I have, both.\n\n467\n00:22:27.918 --> 00:22:28.782\n&gt;&gt; No the original one,\n\n468\n00:22:28.782 --> 00:22:31.719\nokay because the original one That's\nthe better one of the two, right?\n\n469\n00:22:31.719 --> 00:22:33.372\nAnd number one, not number two.\n\n470\n00:22:33.372 --> 00:22:35.302\nThat crazy second and third one.\n\n471\n00:22:35.302 --> 00:22:38.671\nNot Viggo,but the first one, with the Stay\nPuff marshmallow guy, that's the one.\n\n472\n00:22:38.671 --> 00:22:41.045\nSo Gozer the Gozerian the key master,\nyou are now the key master.\n\n473\n00:22:41.045 --> 00:22:42.246\n&gt;&gt; Sweet.\n\n474\n00:22:42.246 --> 00:22:44.160\n&gt;&gt; The key mistress,\nnot the key master, right?\n\n475\n00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.190\nSo we have the keeper of the key, right?\n\n476\n00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:49.140\nAnd Cherokee is responsible for\nkeeping our product key secure.\n\n477\n00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:54.980\nSo the idea Kerckhoffs essentially\nespousing was, hey, focus on the key.\n\n478\n00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:55.889\nKeep the key secure.\n\n479\n00:22:55.889 --> 00:22:57.296\nGive away everything else.\n\n480\n00:22:57.296 --> 00:22:59.444\nTell everybody what\nalgorithm you're using.\n\n481\n00:22:59.444 --> 00:23:00.890\nTell them how you set it up.\n\n482\n00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:03.002\nTell them what they cipher text is.\n\n483\n00:23:03.002 --> 00:23:04.340\nGive it to them, we don't care.\n\n484\n00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:06.830\nBut you can't give away the key\ncuz if you give away the key,\n\n485\n00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:10.180\nwhat's gonna happen is everybody is gonna\nbe able to read all that information,\n\n486\n00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:12.640\nunderstand it and of course,\nwe're gonna have a problem.\n\n487\n00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.770\nSo you gotta keep the key secure.\n\n488\n00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:15.750\nVery very important to do that.\n\n489\n00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:18.855\nKerckhoffs is a smart guy as\nmany of these people were.\n\n490\n00:23:18.855 --> 00:23:24.070\nAnd he looked around him, observed\nhow this was all starting to happen.\n\n491\n00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:27.959\nIf you remember historically around this\ntime, you'd already have Vigenere cipher\n\n492\n00:23:27.959 --> 00:23:31.321\nfor probably close to 300 years\napproximately at this point, right.\n\n493\n00:23:31.321 --> 00:23:34.418\nSo the polyalphabetic cipher\ntables that we looked at.\n\n494\n00:23:34.418 --> 00:23:38.222\nYou had, by this point, the play fair\ncipher that had already been going on.\n\n495\n00:23:38.222 --> 00:23:42.128\nYou had advances in what\nwe'd think of as early and\n\n496\n00:23:42.128 --> 00:23:45.056\nmodern cryptography taking place.\n\n497\n00:23:45.056 --> 00:23:47.790\nAnd Kerckhoffs is\nexamining this landscape,\n\n498\n00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:49.970\nthinking about it from\na different perspective.\n\n499\n00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:51.930\nHe wasn't coming up with\na brand new crypto system.\n\n500\n00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:54.921\nHe wasn't coming up with\na new way of encrypting data,\n\n501\n00:23:54.921 --> 00:23:57.913\nhe looked at it from a different\nperspective and said,\n\n502\n00:23:57.913 --> 00:24:02.220\nhow are we going to ensure the viability\nand the secrecy of the system, right?\n\n503\n00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:05.668\nHe really examined it, not from the nuts\nand bolts mechanics perspective, but\n\n504\n00:24:05.668 --> 00:24:08.767\nrather from the usability perspective and\nthe security perspective.\n\n505\n00:24:08.767 --> 00:24:11.389\nReally one of the first people to do that,\nand\n\n506\n00:24:11.389 --> 00:24:15.876\nthink about it from outside of the actual\ncreation of a cryptosystem itself.\n\n507\n00:24:15.876 --> 00:24:18.632\nAnd thinking about the algorithm and\nthe approach,\n\n508\n00:24:18.632 --> 00:24:23.590\nrather than the management of the holistic\nenvironment that we have to operate it.\n\n509\n00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:26.650\nReally keen insight at that point in time,\nif you think about it.\n\n510\n00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:30.125\nBecause up until then, you'd have\nthe practitioners, the mechanics that\n\n511\n00:24:30.125 --> 00:24:33.778\nhad come up with whatever the cipher was,\nand say, okay, this is a better way.\n\n512\n00:24:33.778 --> 00:24:35.106\nBut that's all they did, and\n\n513\n00:24:35.106 --> 00:24:37.670\nI'm not minimizing that when\nI say that's all they did.\n\n514\n00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:38.828\nBut that's what they did.\n\n515\n00:24:38.828 --> 00:24:42.973\nThey didn't really think about it\nin the overarching ecosystem or\n\n516\n00:24:42.973 --> 00:24:45.200\nthe holistic view, right, of it.\n\n517\n00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:49.050\nThey just said, let's just use this\nparticular approach and that'll be it.\n\n518\n00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:52.520\nHe really changed the game in the sense\nof looking at it from the outside and\n\n519\n00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:55.460\nsaying, looking at it from the outside in,\n\n520\n00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:58.900\nwhat's the key weakness that we\nhave to focus on to ensure secrecy.\n\n521\n00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:00.220\nAnd let's make sure we stand on that.\n\n522\n00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:00.795\n&gt;&gt; Well, I don't.\n\n523\n00:25:00.795 --> 00:25:02.080\n&gt;&gt; So it's a very keen observation.\n\n524\n00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.937\n&gt;&gt; That's still an approach or\na perspective that we can respect today\n\n525\n00:25:04.937 --> 00:25:08.054\nthat can be applied in that sense,\nreally helps set you apart there yeah.\n\n526\n00:25:08.054 --> 00:25:10.085\n&gt;&gt; If you don't you can't\ndo symmetric cryptography.\n\n527\n00:25:10.085 --> 00:25:14.983\nIt's as valid today as it was 100 plus\nyears ago when he came up with it at\n\n528\n00:25:14.983 --> 00:25:16.410\nthis point, right?\n\n529\n00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:19.875\nBecause if we don't see that\nas being legitimate and\n\n530\n00:25:19.875 --> 00:25:23.262\na legitimating litmus test\naround the validity and\n\n531\n00:25:23.262 --> 00:25:28.554\nthe secrecy of the symmetric system,\nsymmetric cryptography doesn't work.\n\n532\n00:25:28.554 --> 00:25:33.070\nBecause if you throw Kerckhoffs'\nobservation his principle out the window.\n\n533\n00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:34.565\nYou can't use symmetric cryptography,\nright?\n\n534\n00:25:34.565 --> 00:25:35.501\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n535\n00:25:35.501 --> 00:25:39.661\n&gt;&gt; To your point, it's as important as\nfunctional here today in this moment,\n\n536\n00:25:39.661 --> 00:25:44.276\nregardless of when you're watching us as\nwell as it was 150 years ago when he first\n\n537\n00:25:44.276 --> 00:25:44.800\nsaid it.\n\n538\n00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.485\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Or whenever that is now based on when\n\n539\n00:25:46.485 --> 00:25:47.417\nyou're watching.\n\n540\n00:25:47.417 --> 00:25:49.247\nWoo, time travel, right?\n\n541\n00:25:49.247 --> 00:25:50.774\nSo just keep that in mind and\nthink about that. But it's also, again,\n\n542\n00:25:50.774 --> 00:25:54.451\nvery very important for us to be thinking\nabout this and understanding this, right?\n\n543\n00:25:54.451 --> 00:25:55.610\n&gt;&gt; So true Adam.\n\n544\n00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:58.500\nThose concepts are still as equally\nimportant today just as they\n\n545\n00:25:58.500 --> 00:25:59.520\nwere back then.\n\n546\n00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:00.770\nBut thank you for that information.\n\n547\n00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:02.740\nAnd thank you ladies and\ngentlemen for tuning in.\n\n548\n00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:05.610\nBut stay tuned,\nwe have more information headed your way.\n\n549\n00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:07.170\nFor this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n550\n00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:09.420\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n551\n00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:12.700\n&gt;&gt; I'm the purveyor of future information\ncoming your way, otherwise known as Adam.\n\n552\n00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:13.210\n&gt;&gt; And there you go.\n\n553\n00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:15.865\n[LAUGH] All right,\nsigning off here at ITProTV.\n\n554\n00:26:15.865 --> 00:26:16.945\nBye.\n\n555\n00:26:16.945 --> 00:26:24.680\n[MUSIC]\n\n556\n00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.593\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.190\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.847\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.847 --> 00:00:15.910\nWelcome to your ECES series,\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.962\nIf you've been following along, you'll\nknow that we've been looking at different\n\n7\n00:00:19.962 --> 00:00:23.865\nways to summarize symmetric encryption,\nand cryptography, as well as hashes.\n\n8\n00:00:23.865 --> 00:00:29.016\nNow, in the previous episode Mr.\nAdam Gordon, we spoke about some math.\n\n9\n00:00:29.016 --> 00:00:33.112\nAnd well, in this episode looks like we're\ngonna be talking a little bit more about\n\n10\n00:00:33.112 --> 00:00:34.910\nsome math and even executing it.\n\n11\n00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.900\nSo with us today we have Adam Gordon in\nstudios, thank you for joining us today.\n\n12\n00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.630\n&gt;&gt; Glad to be here.\n\n13\n00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.730\nActually, I'm just pondering\nthe execution of math in my mind as\n\n14\n00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.760\nCherokee introduced us.\n\n15\n00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.950\nI don't know what I'm gonna execute,\n\n16\n00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.070\nthat's such an interesting way to\nput what we're about to talk about.\n\n17\n00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.790\nWe'll see how we how that goes for us.\n\n18\n00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.840\nI'm hoping we don't have to execute\nanything other than perhaps your fear and\n\n19\n00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.150\nyour misconceptions about cryptography and\nmath.\n\n20\n00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.486\nCuz we are gonna try to dispel those and\nget rid of those for you.\n\n21\n00:01:00.486 --> 00:01:02.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So maybe that's a kinder,\n\n22\n00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.849\ngentler way of putting that statement,\ncuz that sounded so\n\n23\n00:01:05.849 --> 00:01:08.790\nharsh when you say execute math,\nsounded so harsh.\n\n24\n00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna try to make this fun and\n\n25\n00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.960\nexciting for you, all kidding aside.\n\n26\n00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.980\nMath can be scary, we talked a little\nbit about this in the last episode, and\n\n27\n00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.310\nit can be a little overwhelming.\n\n28\n00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.950\nAnd I share with you that I do have\nan innate fear of math, I think.\n\n29\n00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.340\nBut I do try to make it work for me and\n\n30\n00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.740\nwhen I talk to students, especially when\nI talk to customers about this stuff,\n\n31\n00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.900\nI try to give them the understanding\nthey need to be successful.\n\n32\n00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.120\nWanna do the same thing for\nyou here momentarily, but\n\n33\n00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.490\nalso try to make it approachable.\n\n34\n00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.770\nAnd I think striking that balance\nis what we're looking for,\n\n35\n00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.225\nand I'm interpreting what\nCherokee said that way.\n\n36\n00:01:39.225 --> 00:01:40.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As opposed\n\n37\n00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.990\nto standing math up against the wall.\n\n38\n00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.580\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry,\n\n39\n00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.172\nI think my fear was just kind of\nexuding through my personality there.\n\n40\n00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:48.456\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we're not gonna execute it,\n\n41\n00:01:48.456 --> 00:01:51.107\nwe are gonna attempt to enlighten and\nbroaden your horizons a little bit and\n\n42\n00:01:51.107 --> 00:01:54.195\nmake you more interested, and hopefully a\nlittle bit more knowledgeable about this.\n\n43\n00:01:54.195 --> 00:01:58.433\nSo we thought we would pick up our\nconversation thread from our last episode\n\n44\n00:01:58.433 --> 00:02:02.554\nhere, at this point where we talk a bit\nmore about math as Cherokee said.\n\n45\n00:02:02.554 --> 00:02:05.632\nAnd specifically,\nwanna talk about an interesting topic,\n\n46\n00:02:05.632 --> 00:02:09.309\none that is very important for what we do,\nbut a lot of times people don't\n\n47\n00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:13.810\neven really think about it or understand\nit per se, and that would be binary math.\n\n48\n00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.778\nAnd binary math, the thought process\nis before we get into it, we'll put up\n\n49\n00:02:17.778 --> 00:02:21.753\na picture here or a table we're gonna\nuse in just a second to talk through it.\n\n50\n00:02:21.753 --> 00:02:26.559\nBut binary math is the idea of being able\nto use base 2 notation as opposed to what\n\n51\n00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:29.312\nwe think of as decimal or\nbase 10 notation.\n\n52\n00:02:29.312 --> 00:02:34.241\nOur standard 0 through 9, move\nthe placeholder over or add a new column,\n\n53\n00:02:34.241 --> 00:02:39.410\n0 out the 1 column and start 10,\n11, 12, etc, as we go down.\n\n54\n00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.850\nAnd then, add another column and\n\n55\n00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.320\nwe have the hundreds and the thousands\nas we go through the numerical system.\n\n56\n00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.059\nThe ones that most of us around\nthe world have grown up with and\n\n57\n00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:49.947\nunderstand regardless of where we live.\n\n58\n00:02:49.947 --> 00:02:54.250\nThis is not a specific regional or\ncultural thing, this is generically how\n\n59\n00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.500\nalmost without exception, all of our\nnumber systems today are built on.\n\n60\n00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.200\nAt least the ones that we grow up with and\nlearn in school, there are many other\n\n61\n00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.180\nnumber systems, not to imply that base\n10 is the only one, by any means.\n\n62\n00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.930\nBut it's one that's commonly used by\nalmost everyone on the planet on a regular\n\n63\n00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:08.920\nbasis.\n\n64\n00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.750\nFor modern work, modern computing systems,\n\n65\n00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.000\nthings of that nature in terms of that\nkind of math, they do use both base 10,\n\n66\n00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.360\nbut also base 2 with regards to algorithms\nand cryptography in particular.\n\n67\n00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.330\nAnd so we know that we're\ncomfortable growing up with and\n\n68\n00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.255\nlearning about base 10.\n\n69\n00:03:25.255 --> 00:03:26.955\nTen fingers on our hands, typically,\n\n70\n00:03:26.955 --> 00:03:31.005\nmore often than not,\nusually ten toes on our feet as well.\n\n71\n00:03:31.005 --> 00:03:35.975\nAnd so, we are equipped fundamentally,\nand just by the normal way that we\n\n72\n00:03:35.975 --> 00:03:40.035\nlook at the world, and through nature to\nat least have a reference point for this.\n\n73\n00:03:40.035 --> 00:03:40.935\nAnd this is, believe it or\n\n74\n00:03:40.935 --> 00:03:45.245\nnot, historically, where we actually\nthink the concept of base 10 came from.\n\n75\n00:03:45.245 --> 00:03:49.830\nBecause people did, when they first\nstarted out, however many millennium ago\n\n76\n00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.030\nprobably counted on their fingers and,\nor their toes to figure stuff out.\n\n77\n00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.240\nAnd base 10 became a natural way to do\nthat because people were equipped, for\n\n78\n00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.210\nthe most part.\n\n79\n00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.210\nBarring an accident or some sort of\nproblem, or maybe they weren't born with\n\n80\n00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.460\nall of their fingers or toes, or\nperhaps lost one due to an accident.\n\n81\n00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.970\nThat most people would have been\nequipped to, in theory, count to ten,\n\n82\n00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.100\nor what we think of as ten today.\n\n83\n00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.980\nAnd historically,\n\n84\n00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.410\nwe think that's maybe where this came\nfrom, although nobody is sure, right?\n\n85\n00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.055\nIt could have been the aliens that\nflew down from Roswell and said,\n\n86\n00:04:17.055 --> 00:04:18.800\nyou're gonna count with ten and\nthat's what we're gonna do as well.\n\n87\n00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.610\n&gt;&gt; Beam me up.\n\n88\n00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:20.320\n&gt;&gt; Who knows, right?\n\n89\n00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.610\nBut the point is,\nthat's the story we're going with.\n\n90\n00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.450\nBut when we think about that,\nit's kind of interesting and\n\n91\n00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.840\nfunny when you think about the sense\nthat you have something that is just,\n\n92\n00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.380\nliterally we take for granted every day.\n\n93\n00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.780\nWe don't really think about it,\nwhen you grow up and\n\n94\n00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.810\nlearn how to interact with that kind of\na math system, you start buying things.\n\n95\n00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.920\nYou make change, you do whatever you do,\n\n96\n00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.775\nall of the things we\njust do automatically.\n\n97\n00:04:40.775 --> 00:04:44.470\nThen we stop and think about,\nyou look back and say, yeah, that is kinda\n\n98\n00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.300\nthe foundation of everything I know,\nit is the foundation of everything I do.\n\n99\n00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.170\nWhat if you grew up in\na different universe,\n\n100\n00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.320\nin a different world where instead\nof base 10, it was base 7 or base 6?\n\n101\n00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.290\nI mean, it would have been fundamentally\nthe same in the sense you would have been\n\n102\n00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.000\ncomfortable with that and\nthat's what you would know.\n\n103\n00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.630\nWe just happened to have settled\non base 10, however we got there.\n\n104\n00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.250\nSo we're not gonna talk about base 10,\n\n105\n00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.066\nbecause I think most\npeople understand that.\n\n106\n00:05:06.066 --> 00:05:08.908\nBut you're gonna see it as\na reference point in the diagram and\n\n107\n00:05:08.908 --> 00:05:10.339\nthe chart I'm about to put up.\n\n108\n00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:14.182\nAnd you're gonna see that as the reference\npoint counterpose to base 2.\n\n109\n00:05:14.182 --> 00:05:17.878\nAnd base 2, the idea of this\nthought process is our binary math\n\n110\n00:05:17.878 --> 00:05:22.006\nsystem that allows us to understand\nhow to do the same kinds of things.\n\n111\n00:05:22.006 --> 00:05:27.998\nBut to expand our system and then use\nthe thought process of base 2 to do it.\n\n112\n00:05:27.998 --> 00:05:31.571\nSo if we could take a look,\nmomentarily, there we go,\n\n113\n00:05:31.571 --> 00:05:33.950\nup at our binary math table now.\n\n114\n00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.040\nCorrect me if we're wrong but\nthis will be part of our show notes so\n\n115\n00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.417\npeople will have access to this document.\n\n116\n00:05:37.417 --> 00:05:38.383\n&gt;&gt; Yes, sir.\n\n117\n00:05:38.383 --> 00:05:41.835\n&gt;&gt; They can take a look at this download\nthis, so they don't have to reproduce it.\n\n118\n00:05:41.835 --> 00:05:44.860\nAlthough, they certainly could pause\nthe screen and start typing that out but\n\n119\n00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.570\nwe don't want you to go\nto all that trouble.\n\n120\n00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.618\nWe go to that trouble for you and we want\nyou to be able to benefit from that, so\n\n121\n00:05:50.618 --> 00:05:53.790\nwe're gonna give them a present,\nmake that available for everybody.\n\n122\n00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:54.570\n&gt;&gt; Merry Christmas.\n\n123\n00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.280\n&gt;&gt; Download that and get it from us,\nor Happy Hanukkah where of you maybe.\n\n124\n00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.118\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n125\n00:05:58.118 --> 00:06:01.545\n&gt;&gt; Whatever it may be, perhaps it's just\nMay 15th, and that's a fun day as well,\n\n126\n00:06:01.545 --> 00:06:02.452\nwho knows what it is.\n\n127\n00:06:02.452 --> 00:06:05.246\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, what we see in the table is our\n\n128\n00:06:05.246 --> 00:06:08.650\ntraditional decimal or base 10 notation,\nwe see that over here.\n\n129\n00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.690\nYou only see 0 through 8, but we'll scroll\ndown and see as it goes all the way down.\n\n130\n00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.470\nYou'll see our binary base 2\ncolumn here and our notation.\n\n131\n00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.060\nAnd so you could see, for instance, that\nin the beginning, we start out the same.\n\n132\n00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.465\n0 is essentially 0 in both.\n\n133\n00:06:21.465 --> 00:06:23.300\n1 is the same in both.\n\n134\n00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.880\nBut we start to diverge here when\nwe get to 2, interestingly enough.\n\n135\n00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.030\nLet's just highlight that if we can,\nI'm doing this sideways, see there we go.\n\n136\n00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.670\nCuz I'm looking up straight ahead at you\nlooking at the overhead, I'm not looking\n\n137\n00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.150\ndown to be able to see it so I have to,\nmy depth perception's a little off.\n\n138\n00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.060\nSo I have to make sure I can catch that.\n\n139\n00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.014\nSo you'll see we have base 10, and\n\n140\n00:06:42.014 --> 00:06:45.177\nin base 10 our system that\nwe're used to 2 is 2, right?\n\n141\n00:06:45.177 --> 00:06:49.805\nWe have two 1s essentially in the 1\ncolumn, 0 in the 10 column, and so\n\n142\n00:06:49.805 --> 00:06:51.310\nwe'd write that as 2.\n\n143\n00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:57.760\nIn the base 2 notation you'll see that we\nhave a 2 column and we have a 1 column.\n\n144\n00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.776\nAnd so if you think about this\nnot as a table read as a row but\n\n145\n00:07:01.776 --> 00:07:03.962\nrather as a series of columns.\n\n146\n00:07:03.962 --> 00:07:08.649\nWhat we're doing is we're putting a mark\nin the column that represents 2 and\n\n147\n00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:11.039\nwe mark with either a 0 or a 1, right?\n\n148\n00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:12.479\nThis is a binary system.\n\n149\n00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:13.164\n&gt;&gt; On or off.\n\n150\n00:07:13.164 --> 00:07:16.050\n&gt;&gt; So we use on or off,\nwhich is why we use it for computers.\n\n151\n00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.660\n0 or 1, right?\n\n152\n00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.400\nAnd so those are the only two numbers\nthat we will use to signify something\n\n153\n00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.710\nin our system.\n\n154\n00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.090\nAnd as a result, if we put a 1 there,\nwe're signifying essentially on, or\n\n155\n00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:31.040\nselect or whatever you wantna\ninterpret that as true, yes.\n\n156\n00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.760\nYou could think of different ways,\nbut essentially 1 equals I want that\n\n157\n00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:39.880\nto be available, 0 equals off or no or\nnegative or whatever you would imply.\n\n158\n00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.860\nAnd so when we do this, one zero,\nwhat we would interpret in a base 10\n\n159\n00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:48.780\nsystem is the number 10 is actually\nin base 2 in binary, the number 2.\n\n160\n00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:52.331\nBecause we're putting a 1 to\nsignify select in the 2 column and\n\n161\n00:07:52.331 --> 00:07:56.867\nwe're zeroing out the 1 column to the\nright, and so a 0 indicates no selection,\n\n162\n00:07:56.867 --> 00:07:58.414\n1 indicates a selection.\n\n163\n00:07:58.414 --> 00:08:03.699\nAnd so in a binary base 2 system, 1 0 is\nthe equivalent of 2 in the base 10 system.\n\n164\n00:08:03.699 --> 00:08:07.347\nWhich is a little bit crazy,\nuntil you start thinking about all that.\n\n165\n00:08:07.347 --> 00:08:11.660\nAnd then we begin to see that start to\nactually go kind of like this, right,\n\n166\n00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.022\nbecause they diverge as we\nstart to go through this.\n\n167\n00:08:15.022 --> 00:08:20.970\nNumber 3 now becomes an 11 in\nthe traditional way of just reading that\n\n168\n00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:26.750\nnumber, 1-1, because both columns\nhave a selection that is on or true.\n\n169\n00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:29.730\nAnd as a result,\nwe put a 1 in each column to signify that.\n\n170\n00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:33.644\nAnd so when we add the 2 column and\nthe 1 column together, and\n\n171\n00:08:33.644 --> 00:08:37.670\nwe put 1 in both to signify true for\nboth, we get the number 3.\n\n172\n00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:44.180\nAnd so 3 in binary base-2 is actually 11,\nor base-10 notation, known as 11.\n\n173\n00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:46.100\nAnd as we scroll down,\nlet me just do this so\n\n174\n00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.770\nthat we can just see this,\nwe'll keep the header, the binary, and\n\n175\n00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:53.330\nthe decimal there, so we can track,\nand just see what that looks like.\n\n176\n00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:57.350\nWe'll go down to 3, and we'll just\nhighlight as we go, let me see if I can,\n\n177\n00:09:00.137 --> 00:09:03.855\nThere we go, yeah, there, I had it.\n\n178\n00:09:03.855 --> 00:09:04.502\n&gt;&gt; Almost.\n\n179\n00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:08.950\n&gt;&gt; Okay, there we go, 25 clicks later, so\nwe have 3, and that's what we can see now.\n\n180\n00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:14.600\nIf we go down to 4, we'll see that 4,\nwe have to open up a third column, right.\n\n181\n00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:19.610\nBecause we now have the 1 column, we have\nthe 2 column, and now we're gonna open up\n\n182\n00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:25.370\na third column, you'll see it noted\nthere right here as the 4 column.\n\n183\n00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.635\nLet me just without undoing that.\n\n184\n00:09:27.635 --> 00:09:30.493\n[LAUGH] Let me do it this way.\n\n185\n00:09:30.493 --> 00:09:33.010\nWell, I can't, there we go, all right,\n\n186\n00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:36.170\nit's a matter of clicking\nthe right place with that mouse.\n\n187\n00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:40.560\nAnd we can see that when we add the third\ncolumn, right, and we're doing this from\n\n188\n00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:45.110\nright to left, right because we're adding\ncolumns this way, as we go, right.\n\n189\n00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.600\nIf you think about the same\nthing we do in base-10 notation.\n\n190\n00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.271\nWe start with the 1 and we add the 10\ncolumn, then we would add the 100 column,\n\n191\n00:09:51.271 --> 00:09:52.539\nthe 1000 column, etc.\n\n192\n00:09:52.539 --> 00:09:53.223\nAs we would go,\n\n193\n00:09:53.223 --> 00:09:57.320\nas placeholders, so we're building out\nfrom the right to the left going this way.\n\n194\n00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:02.432\nSo we have the 4 column, we 0 out the 1\nand the 2, and we put a placeholder to\n\n195\n00:10:02.432 --> 00:10:07.730\nsignify select in the 4 column indicating\na 1 for the 4, 0 for 2, 0 for 1.\n\n196\n00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:13.499\nTotal that up, the number 4 in\nbase-10 equals the designation 100 or\n\n197\n00:10:13.499 --> 00:10:17.917\nwhat we think of as base-10 notation,\nnumber 100,\n\n198\n00:10:17.917 --> 00:10:21.721\nsignifies 4 in base-2 or binary-2, right.\n\n199\n00:10:21.721 --> 00:10:25.161\nSo it is just kinda interesting\nwhen you start going through this.\n\n200\n00:10:25.161 --> 00:10:28.818\nNow the pattern you will find if\nyou start looking is that things\n\n201\n00:10:28.818 --> 00:10:34.130\nare chunked into blocks of 4, right,\nas we do 4, 0, 1, 2, 3 is a block of 4.\n\n202\n00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:37.583\nAnd then we add another column,\n4, 5, 6, and 7,\n\n203\n00:10:37.583 --> 00:10:41.230\nyou'll see as we go down,\nare all gonna use the 4.\n\n204\n00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:47.840\nAnd then once we get down here,\nwe will find Let me do it this way.\n\n205\n00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:52.130\nWe will find that, it's a matter of just\ngetting that little arrow right there.\n\n206\n00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:55.950\nWe will find that as we scroll down and\nwe go from 7 to 8,\n\n207\n00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:59.030\nlet me just bring this up in the middle\nof the screen so we could see this,\n\n208\n00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:04.497\nas we go from 7 and we cross over to 8,\nwhich would be our next\n\n209\n00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:10.220\ncolumn or our next add point\nwhere we will add another column.\n\n210\n00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:14.700\nWe can see that we now go to 8 and\nwe add a new column for 8.\n\n211\n00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:19.685\nAnd then we go down 1, 2, 3,\n4 for 8, right, as you can see.\n\n212\n00:11:19.685 --> 00:11:23.361\nRight, and then, but\nwith 8 as you can see, we're adding,\n\n213\n00:11:23.361 --> 00:11:26.926\nit's not just chunks of 4 now\nbecause now when we get to 8.\n\n214\n00:11:26.926 --> 00:11:31.660\nRemember, we've gotta fill in all those\nblocks, we gotta fill in the 1, the 2,\n\n215\n00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:33.030\nthe 4, the 8.\n\n216\n00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:36.460\nAnd so now it actually goes to 8\nbefore we actually add a new one.\n\n217\n00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:42.423\nAnd then as we go down, you'll see\nthat we get to 16, and we add 16, but\n\n218\n00:11:42.423 --> 00:11:48.310\nwe've gone through 1, 2, 3, 4,\n5, 6, 7, and 8 to get there.\n\n219\n00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:52.830\nBecause after we do the initial 2\nblocks of 4, we have 4 columns, and\n\n220\n00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.550\nwe have to placeholders\nthrough all of them\n\n221\n00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:58.600\nin order to signify all the numbers\nbefore we get down to 16.\n\n222\n00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.601\nAnd as we then do that,\nwe're going to add more, and\n\n223\n00:12:00.601 --> 00:12:02.066\nyou can go out the way out beyond 16.\n\n224\n00:12:02.066 --> 00:12:05.412\nYou can make this go all the way\nout to hundreds of places, but\n\n225\n00:12:05.412 --> 00:12:07.970\nthe idea is the same, the pattern holds.\n\n226\n00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:12.430\nAnd so you just wanna understand\nhow binary to notation works.\n\n227\n00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:15.990\nBecause this starts to form\nthe basis of how we build\n\n228\n00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:19.580\nall of our octets as we do\nthings like TCP/IP addressing.\n\n229\n00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:24.220\nAnd understand how to borrow bits,\nand do subnetting, at least for\n\n230\n00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.710\nIPv4, anyway, and certainly IPv6 as well.\n\n231\n00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:29.590\nAnd we have to understand this notation,\nright, because this becomes a way in which\n\n232\n00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:32.950\nwe essentially as we strip\ndown all communication and\n\n233\n00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:36.260\nwe look at the most basic elemental\nform of communication and\n\n234\n00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.010\ncomputers, it's all about the 1's and\nthe 0's.\n\n235\n00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:39.617\n&gt;&gt; Of course, it is.\n\n236\n00:12:39.617 --> 00:12:40.960\n&gt;&gt; Right, or as P.\n\n237\n00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.655\nDiddy once said it's all\nabout the Benjamins.\n\n238\n00:12:42.655 --> 00:12:44.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS}\n&gt;&gt; If you wanted play music trivia,\n\n239\n00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:45.410\nso I'm switching over to music now.\n\n240\n00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:46.160\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n241\n00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.570\nSo it's all about the Benjamins as P.\n\n242\n00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:48.890\nDiddy once said, right.\n\n243\n00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:51.260\nBut this is what forms the basis for\n\n244\n00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:55.310\neverything that we do because computers\nwill understand the binary notation.\n\n245\n00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:59.420\nThey have no idea what the equivalent\ntranslation will be unless we have\n\n246\n00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:01.549\na program that translates for them.\n\n247\n00:13:01.549 --> 00:13:02.670\nBut we do, obviously,\n\n248\n00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:07.050\nbecause computers know how to understand\nbase-10 notation and count to translate.\n\n249\n00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:11.430\nBut they use software and functions\nwithin processors, MathCo processors,\n\n250\n00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:16.020\nthings like that, in the CPU itself, or\nin the operating systems to do that.\n\n251\n00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.882\nMost basic fundamental machine\ncommunication langauge is\n\n252\n00:13:18.882 --> 00:13:19.974\nessentially binary.\n\n253\n00:13:19.974 --> 00:13:21.684\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it sounds great, Adam, but\n\n254\n00:13:21.684 --> 00:13:25.660\nsometimes we're not able to bring those\ncalculators into exams with us, right.\n\n255\n00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.870\nSo I don't know if I'm putting\nthe cart before the horse here,\n\n256\n00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:31.280\nbut I use the delta method sometimes.\n\n257\n00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:34.270\nAnd that's what really is my\nsaving grace because we all know,\n\n258\n00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:36.590\nwe've spoke about how I feel about math.\n\n259\n00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:37.290\n&gt;&gt; Well-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n260\n00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:38.170\n&gt;&gt; There's different ways to\n\n261\n00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:38.810\nget there, right.\n\n262\n00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:43.220\nSo if you're not comfortable doing\nthis all, and listen, I get it,\n\n263\n00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.400\nI'm not necessarily any more\ncomfortable than probably most of you.\n\n264\n00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.920\nAnd I'm not certainly comfortable enough\nto do a lot of it in my head, depending\n\n265\n00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:53.750\non the math we're talking about, but I\nthink you brought up two excellent points.\n\n266\n00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:56.029\nNumber one, we do have to face our fears.\n\n267\n00:13:56.029 --> 00:13:56.920\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; And overcome them and\n\n268\n00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.200\nat least acknowledge that there may be\nthings we're not comfortable doing, but\n\n269\n00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.050\nthat we still have to\nunderstand how to do.\n\n270\n00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.200\n&gt;&gt; To pass those exams, yeah.\n\n271\n00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.550\n&gt;&gt; Not just to pass the exam,\nthe exam is certainly part of it, but\n\n272\n00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:08.630\nI think more fundamentally as I think\nI pointed out in our last episode.\n\n273\n00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:12.910\nIf you're gonna be able to do this, and\ndo it authoritatively, and speak to people\n\n274\n00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:18.250\nknowledgeably, and represent yourself\nas a professional that does this,\n\n275\n00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:23.310\nand should be trusted to do this on\nbehalf of organizations, then you have to\n\n276\n00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:28.750\nunderstand enough of this to be able\nto explain it to an average lay person.\n\n277\n00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:32.050\nI'm not suggesting you should be able to\ngo toe to toe with any of the seminal\n\n278\n00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:33.525\nfigures of encryption and\n\n279\n00:14:33.525 --> 00:14:36.480\ncryptography throughout our history\nthat we've talked about here, right.\n\n280\n00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:40.390\nSitting down and hypothetically having\na conversation with the Alan Turings and\n\n281\n00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:42.990\nthe Claude Shannons and\nthe Bruce Schneiers of the world\n\n282\n00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:46.540\nis not necessarily the goal that you\ncan set for yourself, and I get that.\n\n283\n00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:47.510\nIt would be interesting,\n\n284\n00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:50.662\ndon't get me wrong, but you may not\nbe able to talk shop with them.\n\n285\n00:14:50.662 --> 00:14:55.160\nThere are several layers above where most\nof us operate and I get that, right.\n\n286\n00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:59.840\nBut you do have to if you\nwant to claim the title,\n\n287\n00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:04.360\nthe mantle, the representation of your\nskills actually and adequately for\n\n288\n00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.928\nan employer or for a customer, or\njust for a peer or a colleague.\n\n289\n00:15:07.928 --> 00:15:10.000\nI'm not suggesting for\na minute you would ever lie or\n\n290\n00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.230\nmisrepresent yourself, quite the opposite.\n\n291\n00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:15.030\nI'm just pointing out that you wanna\naccurately represent yourself and\n\n292\n00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.960\nyour skills.\n\n293\n00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:19.140\nAnd in order to do that,\nit's not just enough to say, yeah,\n\n294\n00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:22.370\nI have this piece of paper, I got\nthe certification, I passed this exam.\n\n295\n00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:24.800\nThat is part of it,\nit's very important part of it, but\n\n296\n00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.890\nthat's the beginning of a journey,\nnot the end result of which you wanna do.\n\n297\n00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:31.190\nAnd if we use the yellow\nbrick road analogy,\n\n298\n00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:32.460\nyou with me here on The Wizard of Oz?\n\n299\n00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:33.070\n&gt;&gt; I love Wizard of Oz.\n[LAUGH]\n\n300\n00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:33.671\n&gt;&gt; Okay, you saw that one, right?\n\n301\n00:15:33.671 --> 00:15:34.880\n&gt;&gt; I did, yes.\n\n302\n00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:35.382\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good,\n\n303\n00:15:35.382 --> 00:15:36.363\nif you haven't seen that one,\n\n304\n00:15:36.363 --> 00:15:38.650\nthen you're done,\nwe can't spend any more time together.\n\n305\n00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:41.420\nThat and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\nare base lines, right.\n\n306\n00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:45.722\nYou gotta see those when you're growing\nup as a kid, you show them to your kids.\n\n307\n00:15:45.722 --> 00:15:46.341\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n308\n00:15:46.341 --> 00:15:47.437\n&gt;&gt; They're great movies,\nright, even today.\n\n309\n00:15:47.437 --> 00:15:48.508\n&gt;&gt; Classic.\n\n310\n00:15:48.508 --> 00:15:50.073\n&gt;&gt; They're timeless,\nright, they're timeless.\n\n311\n00:15:50.073 --> 00:15:54.222\nSo if you follow the yellow brick road\nanalogy from Wizard of Oz, right,\n\n312\n00:15:54.222 --> 00:15:56.332\nit's the beginning of the journey,\n\n313\n00:15:56.332 --> 00:16:00.330\nit's where Dorothy engages in\nthe center of the square, right.\n\n314\n00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:02.342\nAnd everybody says, gathers around her,\nfollow the yellow brick road.\n\n315\n00:16:02.342 --> 00:16:05.997\nAnd she sees it start out as a spiral,\nbroadens to this road,\n\n316\n00:16:05.997 --> 00:16:10.729\nand essentially goes down Towards\nthe Emerald City, right, towards Oz, and\n\n317\n00:16:10.729 --> 00:16:13.400\nthis is the beginning of the journey for\nus.\n\n318\n00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:17.090\nThis is where you pass the exam,\nyou take this knowledge,\n\n319\n00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:21.460\nyou validate it, that's the beginning of\nhow you then apply this in the real world.\n\n320\n00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:24.620\nAnd take these skills and\nactually make them your own by using them,\n\n321\n00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:27.600\npracticing them, and\ninteracting with them on a regular basis.\n\n322\n00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.922\nThis is what becomes so important for us.\n\n323\n00:16:29.922 --> 00:16:34.642\nBecause if we don't do this, then we\nreally have no way of understanding how we\n\n324\n00:16:34.642 --> 00:16:39.144\ncan engage and what we can do to prove and\nvalidate our, not only our worth,\n\n325\n00:16:39.144 --> 00:16:44.070\nas I'm clicking on various things and\nnot paying attention to what I'm doing.\n\n326\n00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:48.390\nNot only our worth, but you have to be\nable to validate and prove to somebody\n\n327\n00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:51.380\nthat you can do more than simply\nregurgitate what you've been told, but\n\n328\n00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:54.510\nyou can take this synthesize it and\napply this knowledge.\n\n329\n00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:58.920\nTo explain problems and troubleshooting,\nfigure out reasons why things don't work.\n\n330\n00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:03.130\nIt's easy to say it's the computer,\ncuz it's just not doing whatever.\n\n331\n00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:05.382\nIt's hard to actually\ndiagnose what's wrong.\n\n332\n00:17:05.382 --> 00:17:08.330\nAnd because understanding\nsomething like base two notation,\n\n333\n00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:12.300\nor binary notation, you may never use\nthat to troubleshoot, let's be honest.\n\n334\n00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.740\nWhen was the last time\nin any of your careers,\n\n335\n00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:16.790\nany of our careers,\nsomebody sat you down and\n\n336\n00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:19.920\nsay hey, can you figure out what the base\ntwo problem is with that machine?\n\n337\n00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.000\nYou don't do that.\n\n338\n00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.470\nBut, as we pointed out to you, you use\nthis knowledge to be able to setup and\n\n339\n00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:27.040\ncreate network connectivity?\n\n340\n00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.970\nDo you use it to be able to figure out\nhow to connect machines together through\n\n341\n00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:32.740\nsubnetting, supernetting,\nclasses, Internet domain, routing,\n\n342\n00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:36.600\nand all the other stuff we hopefully\nknow how to do or learn how to do.\n\n343\n00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:37.410\n&gt;&gt; Of course.\n\n344\n00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:41.980\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, you may use a calculator,\nyou may not, right?\n\n345\n00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:43.680\nBut if you don't have one handy,\n\n346\n00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:47.450\nas Cherokee rightly points out,\ngoing into an exam, or in the real world.\n\n347\n00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:50.650\nThe exam is a pivot point, I understand\nit's a focal point, and I get that.\n\n348\n00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:53.765\nIt's a light at the end of the tunnel and\na goal you reach for.\n\n349\n00:17:53.765 --> 00:17:58.310\nBut when I have students get through their\nexams and then say to me hey, I passed,\n\n350\n00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:03.200\nthank you for teaching me and taking\nthe time and helping me or whatever.\n\n351\n00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.160\nThat is a cathartic moment.\n\n352\n00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.260\nIt's a great release.\n\n353\n00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:10.250\nYou're happy but that is then you\nactually take their knowledge and\n\n354\n00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:11.340\nstart to apply it.\n\n355\n00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:14.650\nAnd that's the hard part as far as I'm\nconcerned, not passing the exam, but\n\n356\n00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:17.670\ntaking the knowledge and actually\nusing it in the real world afterwards.\n\n357\n00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:20.590\nSo I think, at least from my perspective,\njust me right?\n\n358\n00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:24.190\nWith my particular opinion, but it is\nthe important one cuz I'm the one who's\n\n359\n00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:27.190\ntalking, so my opinion is the one\nthat matters right now, but\n\n360\n00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:31.410\nfrom my opinion, I think it's so important\nfor you to understand these basic skills.\n\n361\n00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:33.470\nI talk to people all the time.\n\n362\n00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:35.200\nThat never really learned,\nfor whatever reason.\n\n363\n00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:38.202\nEither they went to school but\nnobody took the time to teach them, or\n\n364\n00:18:38.202 --> 00:18:40.519\nthey're self-taught,\nas many of us are, and, or\n\n365\n00:18:40.519 --> 00:18:43.854\nthey think somebody taught them but\nthey just never really got it, right.\n\n366\n00:18:43.854 --> 00:18:47.334\nAnd nobody took the time to\nreally explain it the right way,\n\n367\n00:18:47.334 --> 00:18:49.430\nand as a result they're hesitant.\n\n368\n00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:50.180\nThey don't really get it.\n\n369\n00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:53.150\nThey're not comfortable with it,\nand they do it but\n\n370\n00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:57.687\nit's frustrating on a regular basis and\nthey just never really figured it out.\n\n371\n00:18:57.687 --> 00:19:01.463\nAnd I love to talked to those people I\nlove the opportunity trying to help them\n\n372\n00:19:01.463 --> 00:19:04.298\novercome that and\nreally understand it fundamentally.\n\n373\n00:19:04.298 --> 00:19:08.485\nBut I also hate to hear from those\npeople that that's where they wound up.\n\n374\n00:19:08.485 --> 00:19:10.692\nBecause it's so,\nI can imagine, frustrating for\n\n375\n00:19:10.692 --> 00:19:13.514\nthem because I'd been there and\nI know it's frustrating for me,\n\n376\n00:19:13.514 --> 00:19:16.971\nwhen you never really feel you've got\na good understanding of that knowledge.\n\n377\n00:19:16.971 --> 00:19:21.140\nYou just haven't mastered it, right, and\nyou have to rely on props and tricks.\n\n378\n00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:24.110\nNot that something like\nthe delta approach or\n\n379\n00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:26.450\nwhatever you're talking\nabout isn't a good idea.\n\n380\n00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:28.270\nIt's just that unfortunately,\n\n381\n00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:31.440\nit means that it's your mechanism\nthat makes the knowledge your own.\n\n382\n00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.730\nThat's the most important thing.\n\n383\n00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:36.210\nBut a lot of times people come\nto rely on those things, right?\n\n384\n00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:38.270\nAnd they don't always\nunderstand the fundamentals and\n\n385\n00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:40.520\nthe mechanics of how it works and why.\n\n386\n00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:43.360\nAnd then it's not as meaningful if\nthey don't really get it fully,\n\n387\n00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.470\nis all I'm suggesting.\n\n388\n00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:45.693\nNot that that's the case for\nCherokee at all.\n\n389\n00:19:45.693 --> 00:19:47.039\n&gt;&gt; No, I actually-\n&gt;&gt; But just so\n\n390\n00:19:47.039 --> 00:19:50.900\nyou feel comfortable with\nthat as a cautionary tale.\n\n391\n00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:54.110\nWe don't want you to feel you\nshouldn't learn the reasons why and\n\n392\n00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:56.150\nunderstand the who, what,\nwhen, where, why and how.\n\n393\n00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:57.560\nAs opposed to just simply\nusing the tool and\n\n394\n00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.450\nsaying, well, I can push the button and\ndo it, right?\n\n395\n00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:00.620\nAnd I know that's not\nwhat you were saying.\n\n396\n00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:03.510\nYou were saying it's important to do both.\n\n397\n00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:06.470\n&gt;&gt; For sure, I actually wanted to\nlearn how to start at the bottom and\n\n398\n00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:07.450\nwork my way up.\n\n399\n00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:09.960\nThis is years ago when I was\ntrying to learn subnetting.\n\n400\n00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:12.950\nI couldn't find anyone that\nknew how to do it around me and\n\n401\n00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:16.530\nit's not super common\nin where I had lived.\n\n402\n00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:18.892\nAnd I even put an ad\nonline to try to find it.\n\n403\n00:20:18.892 --> 00:20:21.530\n[LAUGH] And I still but then, you know\nwhat, I didn't have ITProTV at the time.\n\n404\n00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:23.080\n&gt;&gt; Is this the whole friend thing?\n\n405\n00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.123\nThis is like a of the whole friend thing?\n\n406\n00:20:24.123 --> 00:20:24.695\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We were talking about the friend thing\n\n407\n00:20:24.695 --> 00:20:25.759\nbefore.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We won't go there,\n\n408\n00:20:25.759 --> 00:20:26.770\nwe won't go there, yeah.\n\n409\n00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:27.394\nAll right, so\n\n410\n00:20:27.394 --> 00:20:30.880\nnot only does Cherokee need friends,\nshe needs friends who know how to subnet.\n\n411\n00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:31.690\n&gt;&gt; And you can, yeah.\n\n412\n00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:34.325\n&gt;&gt; It's important sub-criteria\nin the friendship search.\n\n413\n00:20:34.325 --> 00:20:38.540\nAll right, so you now chat and\nwe will figure out how to find you.\n\n414\n00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:39.388\n&gt;&gt; I'm good now, I'm good now.\n\n415\n00:20:39.388 --> 00:20:40.985\n&gt;&gt; A subnet, friend, right?\n\n416\n00:20:40.985 --> 00:20:42.710\nA special subneting friend.\n\n417\n00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:45.125\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So make sure, really important,\n\n418\n00:20:45.125 --> 00:20:47.387\nmake sure that you take some time,\n\n419\n00:20:47.387 --> 00:20:51.535\njust take a look at the thought\nprocess behind the binary math.\n\n420\n00:20:51.535 --> 00:20:54.335\nWe've given you the table,\nlook it up online and\n\n421\n00:20:54.335 --> 00:20:56.015\nget a little more understanding of it.\n\n422\n00:20:56.015 --> 00:20:58.065\nA binary table like that one\nthat I showed is pretty common,\n\n423\n00:20:58.065 --> 00:20:59.195\nyou can find them almost anywhere.\n\n424\n00:20:59.195 --> 00:21:00.595\nYou can make your own.\n\n425\n00:21:00.595 --> 00:21:02.310\nNot a big deal.\n\n426\n00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:06.700\nI find that sitting down and going\nthrough it to actual create the table,\n\n427\n00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.630\nto write it out,\nto get it ready for the show notes.\n\n428\n00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:12.370\nThat, number one, it refreshes my memory\nbecause I don't teach binary math on\n\n429\n00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:14.280\na regular basis anymore.\n\n430\n00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:15.890\nSo, I don't do it that often.\n\n431\n00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:19.045\nAlthough I use, as I've said,\nthe outcome of those skills, subnetting,\n\n432\n00:21:19.045 --> 00:21:20.810\nand stuff like that, every day.\n\n433\n00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:23.670\nI just don't go back to the well and\nactually start from, as you said,\n\n434\n00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:25.015\nthe ground up every time I do it.\n\n435\n00:21:25.015 --> 00:21:28.690\nBut having to sit down and\ndo that really made me sit down and think,\n\n436\n00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:31.630\nokay how am I gonna set this up,\nhow I'm gonna structure it,\n\n437\n00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:33.080\nhow are we gonna go through it with you.\n\n438\n00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:35.740\nAnd forced me to really think about it.\n\n439\n00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:37.440\nAnd you'll get back to the basics.\n\n440\n00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:41.000\nAnd I find when I'm studying for exams,\nwhen I'm doing that kind of stuff,\n\n441\n00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.340\nwe've talked about the value\nof flashcards before.\n\n442\n00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:46.310\nBut I find, at least I'm one of those\npeople I'm a kinesthetic learner.\n\n443\n00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:48.116\nI have to do it, right,\nin order to really figure it out.\n\n444\n00:21:48.116 --> 00:21:51.151\nI find making notes and\nmaking those notations or\n\n445\n00:21:51.151 --> 00:21:53.860\ngoing through the exercise on my own.\n\n446\n00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:56.880\nHey let me figure that table out, let\nme write it down, then I'll go look and\n\n447\n00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.130\nsee if I got it right.\n\n448\n00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:01.460\nAnd if I didn't I'll adjust it and\ntweak it a little bit if I did, great.\n\n449\n00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:03.420\nThat's how I internalize that node.\n\n450\n00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:05.740\nJust kinda how I've always been and\nhow I learn.\n\n451\n00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:08.262\nAnd that's the approach I use\nwith students when I teach is,\n\n452\n00:22:08.262 --> 00:22:10.798\nlet me give you the concept,\nlet me put it up, show it to you.\n\n453\n00:22:10.798 --> 00:22:13.895\nBut you're gonna do it to figure it\nout because that's how you're gonna\n\n454\n00:22:13.895 --> 00:22:15.130\nreinforce it right?\n\n455\n00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:18.090\nSo while we've been talking all of you\nbetter have been scribbling down and\n\n456\n00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:19.800\nmaking those binary map tables.\n\n457\n00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:23.400\nCherokee's gonna be popping over and\nshe's gonna be checking on everybody and\n\n458\n00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.350\nshe has gold stars or in this case.\n\n459\n00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:28.590\nShe has, not gold stars but,\noops I don't wanna ruin it, gold keys.\n\n460\n00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:29.830\nYou're gonna get a gold key.\n\n461\n00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:31.110\n&gt;&gt; And cameras in the microwaves.\n\n462\n00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:32.110\n&gt;&gt; And cameras in the microwaves.\n\n463\n00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:34.153\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so she's gonna check on you so\n\n464\n00:22:34.153 --> 00:22:35.550\nmake sure you made your chart up.\n\n465\n00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:37.887\nAll right so\nwe talked about binary math a little bit.\n\n466\n00:22:37.887 --> 00:22:40.995\nWhat I wanna talk about now,\nkinda rounding out or\n\n467\n00:22:40.995 --> 00:22:44.251\nadding the next layer to\nour discussion about math,\n\n468\n00:22:44.251 --> 00:22:48.996\nis the operations to go as part of binary\nmath that we also tend to hear about.\n\n469\n00:22:48.996 --> 00:22:53.855\nAnd oftentimes will say, yeah, x or-ing,\nor the binary or, or the binary and.\n\n470\n00:22:53.855 --> 00:22:57.045\nYou don't hear about them as often,\nyou tend to hear just about binary x or\n\n471\n00:22:57.045 --> 00:22:59.110\nor what we call exclusive or.\n\n472\n00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:00.290\nYou hear about that one.\n\n473\n00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:03.900\nBut again, ask somebody to sit down and\nexplain that to you, and if they are still\n\n474\n00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:06.820\nsitting there when you turn around,\nbecause they probably have run away.\n\n475\n00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:10.170\nThey struggle with this because most\npeople say, it's one of those things like,\n\n476\n00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:12.890\nyeah, I know about XORing,\nI can tell you what that is.\n\n477\n00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:14.430\nBut they can't really explain it to you,\n\n478\n00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:17.210\nbecause nobody ever took the time to\nexplain it to them, like you were saying.\n\n479\n00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:18.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Nobody\n\n480\n00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:20.120\nwas ever there to answer that ad.\n\n481\n00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.443\nAnd as a result, nobody knows how to XOR.\n\n482\n00:23:21.443 --> 00:23:25.851\nSo we're gonnawalk you through quickly,\nwhat binary and, binary or,\n\n483\n00:23:25.851 --> 00:23:29.840\nand binary x or, or\nwhat we would commonly call exclusive or.\n\n484\n00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:33.010\nThat's what x or is actually,\nformally defined as.\n\n485\n00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:34.232\nAn exclusive or.\n\n486\n00:23:34.232 --> 00:23:36.560\nWe're gonna talk about how\nthose work real quick, and\n\n487\n00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:37.890\njust make sure you're\ncomfortable with them.\n\n488\n00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:40.390\nWe're gonna use a few visual aids,\ncuz we gotta show you some numbers, and\n\n489\n00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:41.390\nshow you how this works.\n\n490\n00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:45.890\nSo if we could, please,\nmagic of modern ITProTV technology.\n\n491\n00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:47.740\nSo we're gonna go back to our notes,\nhere again.\n\n492\n00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:49.420\nThis is the show notes for you, right?\n\n493\n00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:52.490\nSo I wanna make sure,\nwhile you're following along, obviously.\n\n494\n00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:53.313\nI wanna make sure you pay attention.\n\n495\n00:23:53.313 --> 00:23:56.849\nI wanna remind you that you can always\npause what we're doing here at any moment.\n\n496\n00:23:56.849 --> 00:23:59.472\nCatch your breath, make some notes,\nyou'll see me scroll through so\n\n497\n00:23:59.472 --> 00:24:01.477\nyou can get a better shot of\neverything on the screen.\n\n498\n00:24:01.477 --> 00:24:06.205\nBut all of this is in the show notes, and\nwe're gonna give this to you to make sure\n\n499\n00:24:06.205 --> 00:24:10.950\nyou have this exact verbiage, this\nexact set of examples we're gonna use.\n\n500\n00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:14.350\nAnd all you have to do is translate that\ninto something that makes sense for you.\n\n501\n00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:16.730\nI would encourage you after I go\nthrough these explanations and\n\n502\n00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:18.390\nyou're studying after the fact.\n\n503\n00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:19.700\nI encourage you to go back and\n\n504\n00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:22.700\nmodify these numbers a little bit,\nput your own numbers in there.\n\n505\n00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:26.320\nI just randomly came up with a set\nof these to explain it to you.\n\n506\n00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:30.300\nYou can modify this sequence, do it on\nyour own, transpose it, if you will.\n\n507\n00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.330\nSo do something else, so\n\n508\n00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:33.440\nagain, internalize that\nknowledge by going through it.\n\n509\n00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:36.445\nAnd you'll say, hey, instead of 1100,\nlet me swap that, and\n\n510\n00:24:36.445 --> 00:24:38.950\nthen let me make sure it works and\napply the rules.\n\n511\n00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:42.900\nAnd if it does, hey now you know it, but\nyou've also done it, as opposed to hearing\n\n512\n00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:47.070\nme or Cherokee, or both of us as we go\nthrough this, talk to you about it, right?\n\n513\n00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:48.910\nSo I'm sure Cherokee's\ngoing to chime in here and\n\n514\n00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:51.940\nhave some things to say about\nthis as we go through as well.\n\n515\n00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:53.940\nSo let's talk about the binary operations.\n\n516\n00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:57.496\nThe binary AND, first we'll do that one,\nthen we'll go down to binary OR, and\n\n517\n00:24:57.496 --> 00:24:59.710\nbinary XOR is right down below there.\n\n518\n00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:00.770\nSo let's start with binary AND.\n\n519\n00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:01.999\nYou can see me define it here.\n\n520\n00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.200\nIf both numbers,\n\n521\n00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:08.220\nright, have a one in both places,\nthen the resulting number is a one.\n\n522\n00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:09.950\nIf not, the resulting number is a zero.\n\n523\n00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:11.239\nNow, couple of rules.\n\n524\n00:25:11.239 --> 00:25:16.028\nWhen we say both numbers and we say in\nboth places, we're doing a columnar\n\n525\n00:25:16.028 --> 00:25:20.550\nlook up a columnar compare,\nwhatever you would like to call it.\n\n526\n00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:24.160\nEssentially, we're stacking numbers up\non top of each other hence first and\n\n527\n00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.880\nsecond as you can see.\n\n528\n00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.900\nAnd we're not going row by row,\nwe're going down and\n\n529\n00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.890\nwe're comparing numbers from\ntop to bottom in a column.\n\n530\n00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:36.000\nAnd so when we say if both numbers have\na one in both places, we're looking at,\n\n531\n00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.340\nin this case, the one here, right.\n\n532\n00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:40.810\nAnd we're looking at the zero here.\n\n533\n00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:45.010\nAnd this is our first comparison\nin a columnar compare, and\n\n534\n00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:48.340\nthen the results at the bottom\nunder the little hash equal line,\n\n535\n00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:52.680\nwhatever you wanna call it, is now\na zero because we don't have two ones.\n\n536\n00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:53.550\nSo a one and a zero.\n\n537\n00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:55.430\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Or a zero and a zero, either way.\n\n538\n00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:56.160\n&gt;&gt; Zero and anything.\n\n539\n00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:58.060\n&gt;&gt; Equals essentially a zero.\n\n540\n00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:01.120\nAnd so\nyou'll see the resultant is a zero for\n\n541\n00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:04.260\nthe first column under\ncompare with the binary AND.\n\n542\n00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:07.351\nWhen we do the binary AND\ncomparison we shift one to the right,\n\n543\n00:26:07.351 --> 00:26:11.051\nwe keep going left to right until we\nrun out of columns, or time or screen.\n\n544\n00:26:11.051 --> 00:26:15.187\nBecause if I do this, there's no more\ncolumns, I can't look, see, gone.\n\n545\n00:26:15.187 --> 00:26:17.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; My hand never leaves my body during\n\n546\n00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:18.150\nthis presentation.\n\n547\n00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:20.960\nBut it does disappear from time to time,\nthen it comes back again.\n\n548\n00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:23.070\nAll right, so\nit would be great if I did this and\n\n549\n00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:25.480\nit came out on the screen right there and\nI was like moving.\n\n550\n00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:26.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Like all the way over.\n\n551\n00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:28.640\n&gt;&gt; We gotta get Megan to figure that out,\nthat will be really cool.\n\n552\n00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:31.750\nSo, we can do 1 and 0 we get a 0 right.\n\n553\n00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:32.580\nSo next one now.\n\n554\n00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:36.910\n1 and 1 what we know we have a 1 in both,\nwe get a 1.\n\n555\n00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:41.240\nSo, you could see the second column\nshows up as 1 when we do a comparison.\n\n556\n00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:46.153\nThe next two are at zeros, so\nwe get the resultant of the comparison\n\n557\n00:26:46.153 --> 00:26:51.264\nwith a binary AND with those two\nnumber sets we compared is 0100.\n\n558\n00:26:51.264 --> 00:26:55.932\nI'm not gonna make you put that in the\nbinary 2 notation and tell me what number\n\n559\n00:26:55.932 --> 00:27:00.710\nthat is, but right, you would be able to\ndo this comparison using a binary AND.\n\n560\n00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:03.550\nAnd this is what we would\nexpect to get as a result.\n\n561\n00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:06.880\nSo we want to think about\nthe logic of the binary AND, and\n\n562\n00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.490\nthink about what we would do with this.\n\n563\n00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:15.600\nWe are doing a comparison of individual\nbits, essentially bitwise comparison,\n\n564\n00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:19.970\nas somebody much wiser than me just\nmentioned in our chatrooms, so\n\n565\n00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:21.580\nI want to give credit where credit is due.\n\n566\n00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:22.345\nAppreciate that.\n\n567\n00:27:22.345 --> 00:27:26.170\nAnd the idea is that we\nare doing the comparison, and\n\n568\n00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:30.630\nwe're doing or we're engaging this\ncomparison to be able to understand\n\n569\n00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:32.650\nwhat the outcome of this comparison is.\n\n570\n00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:37.190\nSo that we can use the result\nto either validate or invalidate\n\n571\n00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:41.920\nsome sort of process or some thought that\nwe're having about whether these match up,\n\n572\n00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:44.100\nwhether they do something or\ndon't something.\n\n573\n00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:48.481\nSo when we're doing a binary AND, we are\ncomparing two sets of numbers looking for\n\n574\n00:27:48.481 --> 00:27:52.610\nan outcome, measuring that result\nagainst whatever we're expecting, but\n\n575\n00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:54.914\nwe use it with a very\nspecific set of rules.\n\n576\n00:27:54.914 --> 00:27:59.160\n1 in 1 equals a 1 in the comparison for\nthe result, 1 and 0 or 0 and\n\n577\n00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:03.950\n0 equals a 0, and as a result we\nwould then get whatever we see there.\n\n578\n00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:10.750\nWhen we move to the binary OR, scroll down\nso we can put that up at the top here, and\n\n579\n00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:15.490\nlet's just do this so we're not distracted\nby the binary XOR until we get there.\n\n580\n00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:19.810\nSo with the binary OR, check to see\nwhether there is a 1 in either or\n\n581\n00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:23.410\nboth numbers in a given place,\nif so, resulting number is 1.\n\n582\n00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:25.550\nIf not, resulting number is 0, right?\n\n583\n00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:29.330\nSo we're checking to see whether\nthere is a 1 in either or both.\n\n584\n00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:32.658\nWhen we did the and it was both, 1 and 2.\n\n585\n00:28:32.658 --> 00:28:37.251\nWhen we do the binary OR, 1 or\nthe other number has to have a 1 for\n\n586\n00:28:37.251 --> 00:28:40.180\nus to trigger the 1 in the result.\n\n587\n00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:41.470\nSo there's a difference here, right.\n\n588\n00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:46.880\nANDing is essentially together ORing\nis either/or, as we often say, right?\n\n589\n00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:50.750\nSo when we do the comparison column\nthere and look up our comparison here,\n\n590\n00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:54.000\n1st column, 1 and a 0,\nwe get a resultant of 1.\n\n591\n00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.380\n0 and 1, we get a resultant of\n1 in our 2nd columnar lookup.\n\n592\n00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:00.930\n1 and 0 in our 3rd columnar lookup,\nwe get a 1.\n\n593\n00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:03.614\nOur 4th column, two 0s, we get a 0.\n\n594\n00:29:03.614 --> 00:29:07.695\nSo, when we look at this\nparticular set of numbers,\n\n595\n00:29:07.695 --> 00:29:10.730\nwe get a different result because\nwe're using a different rule.\n\n596\n00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:13.270\nWe're doing an OR\ncomparison instead of an AND comparison.\n\n597\n00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:15.680\nWhat would this be useful for?\n\n598\n00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:19.360\nWell, if I want to compare two things\ntogether as opposed to comparing either\n\n599\n00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:24.080\nthing being true, I would use a binary OR\nfor either one, I would use a binary AND\n\n600\n00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:26.050\nfor both having to be true or not true.\n\n601\n00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:26.820\nStacking them up.\n\n602\n00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:29.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the first thing that comes\nto my head is the job of a router.\n\n603\n00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:32.330\nWhen you're looking at that network ID and\nthat subnet\n\n604\n00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:35.400\nmask using ANDing there as an example\ntrying to think like those machines, yeah.\n\n605\n00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.420\n&gt;&gt; Correct, so they both have to match.\n\n606\n00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:39.190\nThey both have to match or\nbe in the same grouping in order for\n\n607\n00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:41.890\nus to be able to claim ownership and\ntransfer packets.\n\n608\n00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:45.510\nEssentially, I'm a switch,\nAND/OR a router cuz we do lookups in both.\n\n609\n00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:47.990\nOne's a MAC table or a MAC address table.\n\n610\n00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:49.330\nAnd the other one is gonna be, of course,\n\n611\n00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:52.280\nwhat we commonly call our\nnormal routing table.\n\n612\n00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:53.780\nAbsolutely correct.\n\n613\n00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:55.810\nAll right, so binary XOR.\n\n614\n00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:59.950\nLet's talk about the binary, so what we\ncommonly call, or will uncommonly but\n\n615\n00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:01.950\nformally refer to as the exclusive OR.\n\n616\n00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:04.320\nYou commonly just call it,\nyou don't even call it binary XOR.\n\n617\n00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:07.020\nYou were able to say, I'm XOR-ing\nsomething, that's all they say, but\n\n618\n00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:09.010\nthey mean the binary XOR.\n\n619\n00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:11.040\nSo the XOR, or the exclusive OR, right?\n\n620\n00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.030\nThe binary XOR operation,\n\n621\n00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:15.590\nsometimes called the binary XOR\nfunction as well by the way,\n\n622\n00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:19.200\nif you want to get in on the technicality\non how it's actually gonna be described.\n\n623\n00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.860\nAlways produces a 1 for output.\n\n624\n00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:24.128\nIf either of its inputs is 1, and\n\n625\n00:30:24.128 --> 00:30:28.343\nproduces a 0 output if both of\nit inputs are 0s or 1, right?\n\n626\n00:30:28.343 --> 00:30:32.040\nSo let's think about this and\nlet's look at this rule, all right?\n\n627\n00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:37.070\nAlways produces a 1 as output\nif either of its inputs is a 1.\n\n628\n00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:38.250\nSo let's start with that.\n\n629\n00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:41.300\nIf either of the inputs is a 1,\nwe will put a 1 there.\n\n630\n00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:44.040\nSo let's do our columnar comparison,\nlet's take a look.\n\n631\n00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:48.870\nOur first columnar comparison, we have a 1\nand one in the 2 spots, we get a 1, right?\n\n632\n00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:52.870\nBoth of our column comparison\nitems here in the second one.\n\n633\n00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:57.316\nBoth 1s, don't get a 1, get a 0,\nbecause it says we will produce\n\n634\n00:30:57.316 --> 00:31:00.670\na 0 if outputting both is either all 0s or\nall 1s.\n\n635\n00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:04.140\nSo if we have both being same, we get a 0.\n\n636\n00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:10.102\nIf they are not the same we get a 1, and\nyou'll see we get a 1 and a 0 producing 1,\n\n637\n00:31:10.102 --> 00:31:15.821\ntwo 1's producing a 0, 1 and a 0\nproducing a 1, 0 and a 1 producing a 1.\n\n638\n00:31:15.821 --> 00:31:20.797\n&gt;&gt; Now Adam, I know you warned me about\nbinary being different than our ten-based\n\n639\n00:31:20.797 --> 00:31:22.150\nnumbering systems.\n\n640\n00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:23.549\nAnd this is not how my\nteacher in elementary school\n\n641\n00:31:23.549 --> 00:31:24.260\ntaught me how to do math.\n\n642\n00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:28.910\nAnd so I have to trust and\nbelieve that this information is correct.\n\n643\n00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:31.320\nSo these are called truth tables,\nis that correct?\n\n644\n00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:31.995\n&gt;&gt; Trust nothing.\n\n645\n00:31:31.995 --> 00:31:35.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Trust me or trust nothing.\n\n646\n00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:36.570\nThere is no truth in trust.\n\n647\n00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:37.400\nNo, there are.\n\n648\n00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.820\nAnd I\"m kidding, of course.\n\n649\n00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:41.410\nBut yes, they are sometimes also\nreferred to as truth tables.\n\n650\n00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:46.930\nThe urban myth and legend is because, yes,\nyou have to trust that the person that put\n\n651\n00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:51.100\nthem together wasn't off doing something\nelse and didn't pay attention.\n\n652\n00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:54.890\nBut rather that the outcomes\nare validated based on the rules.\n\n653\n00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:57.340\nAnd as long as you follow the rules,\nyou can go back.\n\n654\n00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:59.725\nAnd the actual funny thing, about\nthe reason they're called truth tables.\n\n655\n00:31:59.725 --> 00:32:02.883\nNot necessarily because we trust,\nin the fact that they're dumb.\n\n656\n00:32:02.883 --> 00:32:05.105\nBut, could you go back to the picture?\n\n657\n00:32:05.105 --> 00:32:05.794\nI want to point out\nsomething specific to this.\n\n658\n00:32:05.794 --> 00:32:06.485\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n659\n00:32:06.485 --> 00:32:09.899\nthe reason is Because you can validate\nby working backwards against the rules\n\n660\n00:32:09.899 --> 00:32:12.065\nto ensure that they\nare implemented correctly.\n\n661\n00:32:12.065 --> 00:32:16.115\nSo they are truth tables because\nyou can validate that they are true\n\n662\n00:32:16.115 --> 00:32:17.750\nby applying the rule.\n\n663\n00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:19.672\nThat's really why they're\ncalled truth tables.\n\n664\n00:32:19.672 --> 00:32:22.815\nAnd I'm making that up, you shouldn't\ntrust me, so there's no truth in anything.\n\n665\n00:32:22.815 --> 00:32:24.971\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I am being serious, though,\n\n666\n00:32:24.971 --> 00:32:27.381\nthat's the real reason why we\nwould actually call it that.\n\n667\n00:32:27.381 --> 00:32:28.091\nThe urban myth and\n\n668\n00:32:28.091 --> 00:32:30.794\nlegend is cuz you're supposed to\ntrust the people who create them.\n\n669\n00:32:30.794 --> 00:32:32.961\nBut there could be a raving\nlunatic that creates them,\n\n670\n00:32:32.961 --> 00:32:35.280\nyou don't know if they are doing\nthat the right way or not.\n\n671\n00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:37.248\nCould be somebody who's\ncounting on fingers and\n\n672\n00:32:37.248 --> 00:32:40.188\ntoes that doesn't understand how to do it,\nand they don't have a clue.\n\n673\n00:32:40.188 --> 00:32:41.443\n&gt;&gt; Forget the rest of those eight numbers.\n\n674\n00:32:41.443 --> 00:32:42.514\nWe only need two.\n\n675\n00:32:42.514 --> 00:32:43.875\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Forget all of that, right,\n\n676\n00:32:43.875 --> 00:32:44.719\nit's just totally irrelevant.\n\n677\n00:32:44.719 --> 00:32:47.305\nI'm using a base 12 system, and\nI'm just making it up as I go.\n\n678\n00:32:47.305 --> 00:32:49.796\nBut yeah, sometimes they\nare referred to as truth tables, and\n\n679\n00:32:49.796 --> 00:32:50.835\nthat is accurate as well.\n\n680\n00:32:50.835 --> 00:32:51.600\n&gt;&gt; Cool, thanks.\n\n681\n00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.080\n&gt;&gt; So the other interesting\nthing about this aside from\n\n682\n00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.130\nthe truth table thing which\nis actually really cool.\n\n683\n00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:57.546\nAnd I wasn't planning on\nbringing that up by the way, so\n\n684\n00:32:57.546 --> 00:32:58.642\nit's good that Cherokee mentioned that.\n\n685\n00:32:58.642 --> 00:33:00.563\nCuz that was not on my\nagenda to talk about, but\n\n686\n00:33:00.563 --> 00:33:04.400\nwe always want to add those little thing,\nand it's always good to know those things.\n\n687\n00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:07.834\nAnd it never hurts to have more\ninformation about a process and\n\n688\n00:33:07.834 --> 00:33:11.745\nhow it works rather than less cuz\nthat is part of unveiling the entire.\n\n689\n00:33:11.745 --> 00:33:13.316\nThe entire-\n&gt;&gt; Picture?\n\n690\n00:33:13.316 --> 00:33:14.487\n&gt;&gt; No.\nThe entire?\n\n691\n00:33:14.487 --> 00:33:15.571\nWhat did you just talk about?\n\n692\n00:33:15.571 --> 00:33:16.668\n&gt;&gt; Truth.\n[LAUGH]\n\n693\n00:33:16.668 --> 00:33:17.232\n&gt;&gt; There you go,\n\n694\n00:33:17.232 --> 00:33:20.566\nthe entire truth which forms part of the-\n&gt;&gt; The big picture.\n\n695\n00:33:20.566 --> 00:33:22.230\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There you go, exactly.\n\n696\n00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:23.838\nYou can tell,\nwe did not rehearse this ahead of time.\n\n697\n00:33:23.838 --> 00:33:26.667\nThis is totally live, and Cherokee's like,\nwhat the hell are you doing?\n\n698\n00:33:26.667 --> 00:33:28.536\nI don't know what you want me to say,\nstop doing that.\n\n699\n00:33:28.536 --> 00:33:32.002\nAll right, so let's talk about the other\nthe interesting thing associated\n\n700\n00:33:32.002 --> 00:33:34.920\nwith XORing,\nwhich is the fact that it's reversible.\n\n701\n00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:39.774\nUnlike the binary AND the binary OR,\nXORing Is actually reversible.\n\n702\n00:33:39.774 --> 00:33:42.500\nBut it's interesting because what you do,\nand I explained it here,\n\n703\n00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:43.913\nwe'll walk through it in a minute.\n\n704\n00:33:43.913 --> 00:33:48.280\nIf we XOR the resulted number, the\nresulted number is what's commonly labeled\n\n705\n00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.630\nin my little demos here as the result.\n\n706\n00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:51.730\nWe call it the resulted,\n\n707\n00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:55.910\nI just didn't bother to label it that\nbecause most people don't know that term.\n\n708\n00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:59.330\nYou know when I say result,\nmost of us having just been through basic\n\n709\n00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:01.840\nmath as you said, base 10,\nbase 2, or whatever it may be.\n\n710\n00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:05.090\nBut math in general,\nyou often hear result, all the time.\n\n711\n00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:05.980\nThat's the result of that.\n\n712\n00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:08.080\nSo people know the concept of result.\n\n713\n00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:10.830\nBut formally,\nwe actually refer to it as resultant,\n\n714\n00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:12.290\nthat's what we actually call it.\n\n715\n00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:14.736\nThe resultant number is merely\nthe item below the line.\n\n716\n00:34:14.736 --> 00:34:18.297\nIn this case, in our example here,\nit's the 1011.\n\n717\n00:34:18.297 --> 00:34:21.714\nSo, if we XOR the resulted\nnumber with the second number,\n\n718\n00:34:21.714 --> 00:34:23.740\nwe get back the first number.\n\n719\n00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:26.577\nIf we're resulted, or\nrather if we take the resulted, and\n\n720\n00:34:26.577 --> 00:34:30.020\nwe XOR with the first number,\nwe get the second number, right?\n\n721\n00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:33.153\nSo either way, if we do,\nessentially we take the result in and\n\n722\n00:34:33.153 --> 00:34:35.690\nXOR it with one of the two values,\nwe'll get the other one.\n\n723\n00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:39.310\nSo, you can reverse it to validate\nthat it was actually done correctly.\n\n724\n00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:42.470\nIt's part of the truth validation when\nwe're talking about truth tables.\n\n725\n00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:45.090\nSo if we evaluate this logic, do you\nwant to help me do this with real quick?\n\n726\n00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:45.990\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n727\n00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:47.278\n&gt;&gt; Okay, can you do it without\nthe rules on the screen, or\n\n728\n00:34:47.278 --> 00:34:48.267\ndo I have to leave\nthe rules on the screen?\n\n729\n00:34:48.267 --> 00:34:49.565\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, let's leave them there.\n\n730\n00:34:49.565 --> 00:34:51.219\n&gt;&gt; Gotta have the rules on the screen,\nright.\n\n731\n00:34:51.219 --> 00:34:52.430\nSo let's, all right.\n&gt;&gt; I'm good with ANDing, but\n\n732\n00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:53.550\nI have to look at the others.\n\n733\n00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:54.374\n&gt;&gt; No problem, no problem, sorry.\n\n734\n00:34:54.374 --> 00:34:56.090\nSo we got the rules, everybody's clear.\n\n735\n00:34:56.090 --> 00:34:57.570\nAll of you following along as well.\n\n736\n00:34:57.570 --> 00:34:58.750\nWe got all the rules up there, right?\n\n737\n00:34:58.750 --> 00:34:59.280\nThey're right on top.\n\n738\n00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:01.680\nSo take as second, make sure\nyou're comfortable with the rules.\n\n739\n00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:02.745\nAnd we can refer to them as we go.\n\n740\n00:35:02.745 --> 00:35:03.745\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But our goal is,\n\n741\n00:35:03.745 --> 00:35:06.787\nwe're gonna take the resultant,\nright here, 1011.\n\n742\n00:35:06.787 --> 00:35:10.065\nLet's just do the second one so\nwe can just do the comparison up,\n\n743\n00:35:10.065 --> 00:35:13.470\nIt'll be easy to see instead\nof jumping over and trying to.\n\n744\n00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:18.430\nSo let's essentially do the exclusive OR\nnow with this and the second one.\n\n745\n00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:20.270\nAnd our goal is to compare and\n\n746\n00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:24.450\nthen see whether what's here is\nactually accurate based on the rules.\n\n747\n00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:25.270\nDoes that make sense?\n\n748\n00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:26.950\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz if it's accurate\n\n749\n00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:28.892\nthen that means we reversed it.\n\n750\n00:35:28.892 --> 00:35:32.900\nAnd it actually does hold true that\nthe XOR not only was done correctly, but\n\n751\n00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:35.670\nthat it is reversible,\nif that makes sense just before we start.\n\n752\n00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:37.130\nSo, let's go through that.\n\n753\n00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:38.510\nSo let's do the comparison.\n\n754\n00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:41.990\nThe first columnar comparison going up,\n1 and a 0, right?\n\n755\n00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:47.690\nNow remember the first rule,\nproduce a 1 if either input is a 1, right?\n\n756\n00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:48.892\nSo 1 and a 0, what do we get?\n\n757\n00:35:48.892 --> 00:35:49.416\n&gt;&gt; 1.\n\n758\n00:35:49.416 --> 00:35:49.985\n&gt;&gt; We get a 1.\n\n759\n00:35:49.985 --> 00:35:52.670\nLet's do the next columnar comparison.\n\n760\n00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:53.720\nZero and one, what do we get?\n\n761\n00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:58.730\n&gt;&gt; If you have either both two zeros or\ntwo ones.\n\n762\n00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:00.693\n&gt;&gt; No, it's a zero and a one.\n\n763\n00:36:00.693 --> 00:36:04.204\nSo, we just did one zero\non the first column, right?\n\n764\n00:36:04.204 --> 00:36:05.651\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; We got a one, so-\n\n765\n00:36:05.651 --> 00:36:06.319\n&gt;&gt; We're going upwards?\n\n766\n00:36:06.319 --> 00:36:07.535\n&gt;&gt; Zero, yeah we're just going like this.\n\n767\n00:36:07.535 --> 00:36:11.800\nSo this way, we just go right up and\nsay, hey, that's the result.\n\n768\n00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:12.980\nSo if we do zero, one.\n\n769\n00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:15.297\nRemember, either input is a one,\nwe put a one.\n\n770\n00:36:15.297 --> 00:36:16.572\n&gt;&gt; We're working backwards,\nI'm sorry, Adam.\n\n771\n00:36:16.572 --> 00:36:18.017\nYep, so this is definitely not scripted.\n\n772\n00:36:18.017 --> 00:36:19.365\n[CROSSTALK] No, let's do this.\n\n773\n00:36:19.365 --> 00:36:21.392\n&gt;&gt; So let's try one more time, okay.\n\n774\n00:36:21.392 --> 00:36:23.164\nThis time, Cherokee's with us.\n\n775\n00:36:23.164 --> 00:36:25.570\n&gt;&gt; Zero and one.\n&gt;&gt; Zero one, we got a one.\n\n776\n00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:26.900\n&gt;&gt; All right, that's our one.\n\n777\n00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:28.610\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nwe've got the first column, right?\n\n778\n00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:29.420\nOne and a zero, we get a one.\n\n779\n00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:30.982\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Second column or comparison,\n\n780\n00:36:30.982 --> 00:36:31.875\nzero one, we get a one.\n\n781\n00:36:31.875 --> 00:36:35.310\n&gt;&gt; Same thing, just transposed,\nyeah, so we get a one.\n\n782\n00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:38.050\n&gt;&gt; So we're scrambling those eggs again,\nright, just like we talked about.\n\n783\n00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:39.251\nSo third one, what do we got?\n\n784\n00:36:39.251 --> 00:36:40.343\nWe got one zero.\n&gt;&gt; That falls to that second\n\n785\n00:36:40.343 --> 00:36:40.881\nportion of the rule.\n\n786\n00:36:40.881 --> 00:36:43.461\nSo the one and the one equals the zero.\n\n787\n00:36:43.461 --> 00:36:44.620\n&gt;&gt; For the fourth one.\n\n788\n00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:45.700\n&gt;&gt; For the fourth one, yep.\n\n789\n00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:49.910\n&gt;&gt; So all three, right, first three, one\none one and the fourth one, as you said,\n\n790\n00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:51.660\nfalls into the second part of the rule,\nright?\n\n791\n00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:55.210\nWhich is if we have both inputs\nbeing the same, we put a zero.\n\n792\n00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:57.630\n&gt;&gt; Right, up in the top right corner.\n\n793\n00:36:57.630 --> 00:37:01.450\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\nnow that we've compared the resultant\n\n794\n00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:04.520\nwith what is labeled the second\n&gt;&gt; Row.\n\n795\n00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:05.830\n&gt;&gt; Input, right?\n\n796\n00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:09.030\nAs a result, we generated the number\nthat is the first number.\n\n797\n00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:09.600\n&gt;&gt; The first row, yeah.\n\n798\n00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:12.260\n&gt;&gt; We reversed the binary XOR and\n\n799\n00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:15.280\nwe validated not only that it was\ndone correctly the first time.\n\n800\n00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:17.320\nBut we validated we can reverse it.\n\n801\n00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:18.580\n&gt;&gt; This is true.\n\n802\n00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:20.070\n&gt;&gt; This is absolutely true.\n\n803\n00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:23.985\nSo that's why I put that XORing is\nreversible, because it is gonna actually\n\n804\n00:37:23.985 --> 00:37:26.934\nallow us to reverse the process\nif it's done correctly.\n\n805\n00:37:26.934 --> 00:37:30.380\nAnd we should be able to do the same\nthing by using the resulted with\n\n806\n00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:31.327\nthe first value.\n\n807\n00:37:31.327 --> 00:37:34.736\nAnd we should through the comparison,\ngenerate the second number,\n\n808\n00:37:34.736 --> 00:37:35.921\nif we did it correctly.\n\n809\n00:37:35.921 --> 00:37:40.850\nBoth ways of doing it would be reversible\nto generate the missing value as long as\n\n810\n00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:46.205\nthe actual comparison itself to generate\nthe initial resultant was accurate.\n\n811\n00:37:46.205 --> 00:37:48.495\nThat's a unique feature of the binary XOR.\n\n812\n00:37:48.495 --> 00:37:52.455\nThe binary AND the binary OR\nare not reversible but the binary XOR is.\n\n813\n00:37:52.455 --> 00:37:54.904\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So it's just kind of interesting little\n\n814\n00:37:54.904 --> 00:37:59.368\nextra added benefit, or little feature if\nyou will, if you're bored you got nothing\n\n815\n00:37:59.368 --> 00:38:03.359\nto do, hey sit in the corner for a few\nminutes do a little binary XOR, right?\n\n816\n00:38:03.359 --> 00:38:04.780\n&gt;&gt; Hey,\nit's more then I knew before the show.\n\n817\n00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:08.194\nI only knew the symbol, the circle with\nthe little addition symbol inside of it.\n\n818\n00:38:08.194 --> 00:38:08.694\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n819\n00:38:08.694 --> 00:38:10.331\n&gt;&gt; Is what we think is the binary XOR,\n\n820\n00:38:10.331 --> 00:38:11.742\nwhich we'll see in a couple of\n\n821\n00:38:11.742 --> 00:38:13.468\nupcoming conversations.\n&gt;&gt; In the truth tables, yeah.\n\n822\n00:38:13.468 --> 00:38:14.539\n[LAUGH]\n\n823\n00:38:14.539 --> 00:38:16.202\n&gt;&gt; When we talk about how block ciphers\n\n824\n00:38:16.202 --> 00:38:17.482\nwork.\nRemember we were gonna go through all\n\n825\n00:38:17.482 --> 00:38:20.081\nthe diagrams they have put together.\nWe're gonna see the binary XOR symbol,\n\n826\n00:38:20.081 --> 00:38:23.271\nwhich as you correctly pointed out is our\ncircle with the little plus sign in it,\n\n827\n00:38:23.271 --> 00:38:25.302\nabsolutely correct.\nOr the x depending on how,\n\n828\n00:38:25.302 --> 00:38:29.090\nit's kinda what direction it's turned in.\nSometimes it looks like a plus or an x.\n\n829\n00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:31.020\nBut that's how we actually\ndo the binary XORs.\n\n830\n00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:35.310\nSo we've done binary AND,\nthe binary OR, the binary XOR.\n\n831\n00:38:35.310 --> 00:38:37.050\nAnd now we are binary out of here.\n\n832\n00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:37.575\nRight, cuz.\n\n833\n00:38:37.575 --> 00:38:38.543\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We are binary done.\n\n834\n00:38:38.543 --> 00:38:41.580\nAll right but\nthat's how we do binary math.\n\n835\n00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:43.420\nWe thought putting this all\ntogether in one episode,\n\n836\n00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:48.210\nspecific just to this, would be helpful to\ngive you the context of all of the pieces\n\n837\n00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:51.770\nyou have to use to understand the rest\nof the conversations we're gonna have.\n\n838\n00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:54.548\nBut I think that means that we're\ngonna say goodbye to this episode.\n\n839\n00:38:54.548 --> 00:38:56.414\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And bring back another one that's gonna\n\n840\n00:38:56.414 --> 00:38:59.088\nhelp us to go into things like\nsymmetric key cryptography,\n\n841\n00:38:59.088 --> 00:39:00.830\nusing what are we gonna talk about?\n\n842\n00:39:00.830 --> 00:39:01.826\nTransposition and substitution.\n\n843\n00:39:01.826 --> 00:39:03.201\n&gt;&gt; Okay, sounds good.\n\n844\n00:39:03.201 --> 00:39:04.890\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna talk also about block and\nstream ciphers.\n\n845\n00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:05.390\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n846\n00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:06.540\n&gt;&gt; Talk about some algorithms and\n\n847\n00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:10.040\nhow those work there, and some other\ninteresting things that are gonna continue\n\n848\n00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:13.380\nthe conversation around symmetric\nencryption, symmetric cryptography.\n\n849\n00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:15.315\nWe are using those terms interchangeably.\n\n850\n00:39:15.315 --> 00:39:16.991\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And hashing which actually we've talked\n\n851\n00:39:16.991 --> 00:39:19.880\nabout as being there, haven't really\ngotten to yet but it's gonna come up in\n\n852\n00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:22.660\na future episode, we're gonna have\nsome stuff to say about that.\n\n853\n00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:25.640\nSo you want to make sure you come back and\ntake a look for that as well.\n\n854\n00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.800\n&gt;&gt; Awesome,\nI think that was relatively painless.\n\n855\n00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:30.440\nAt least at my expense you guys\nare getting to learn out there.\n\n856\n00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:32.290\nSo hopefully you thought the same.\n\n857\n00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:35.690\nBut like Adam said, we do have more\ninformation to cover so stay tuned.\n\n858\n00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:37.580\nBut for this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n859\n00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:38.827\nRemember I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n860\n00:39:38.827 --> 00:39:40.344\n&gt;&gt; I'm a binary XOR.\n\n861\n00:39:40.344 --> 00:39:42.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] See you next\ntime here at ITPRO.TV-\n\n862\n00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:43.980\n&gt;&gt; Wait, I'm reversible, look, wait, wait,\n\n863\n00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:44.626\nI'm reversible, see.\n\n864\n00:39:44.626 --> 00:39:45.761\nReversible.\n&gt;&gt; Ain't that the truth.\n\n865\n00:39:45.761 --> 00:39:47.920\n&gt;&gt; Look, I just reversed, awesome.\n\n866\n00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:48.647\n&gt;&gt; Bye.\n\n867\n00:39:48.647 --> 00:39:56.365\n[MUSIC]\n\n868\n00:39:56.365 --> 00:39:58.838\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; You leave it there,\nsomeone may come along and steal it.\n\n35\n00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.400\nMegan's been eyeing that key\nwhenever you're not in the room.\n\n36\n00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.560\n&gt;&gt; I knew it.\n&gt;&gt; So she may come and\n\n37\n00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.740\nget it if you're not careful.\n\n38\n00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.626\nSo we're gonna talk about just\nthe idea of substitution and\n\n39\n00:01:37.626 --> 00:01:40.407\ntransposition along our way\nto defining something new.\n\n40\n00:01:40.407 --> 00:01:44.258\nWe didn't put this term, this new\nterm I'm about to throw out at you,\n\n41\n00:01:44.258 --> 00:01:45.643\nin the vocabulary show.\n\n42\n00:01:45.643 --> 00:01:49.040\nI just want to make sure that you heard\nabout it here in the context of symmetric\n\n43\n00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.460\ncryptography, but\nsomething called a key schedule.\n\n44\n00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.020\nWe're gonna take a look at that,\ntalk about what that is as well.\n\n45\n00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.320\nYou want to help me\nplay a game real quick?\n\n46\n00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.050\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n47\n00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.060\n&gt;&gt; You said it, you're very\nexcited about that, that's good.\n\n48\n00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.418\nLet's talk about substitution and\nlets talk about transposition.\n\n49\n00:02:02.418 --> 00:02:06.843\nSo, if I said to you, I wanna substitute\nsomething, from your perspective,\n\n50\n00:02:06.843 --> 00:02:10.276\nthe top of your head what are we\ngoing to do for substituting?\n\n51\n00:02:10.276 --> 00:02:11.332\nWhat would you describe that as?\n\n52\n00:02:11.332 --> 00:02:14.047\nHow are we gonna help everybody\nout there to remember and\n\n53\n00:02:14.047 --> 00:02:16.100\nunderstand what's substitution is?\n\n54\n00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.070\n&gt;&gt; Substitute, swap, there we go.\n\n55\n00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.430\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna substitute or swap?\n\n56\n00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.960\n&gt;&gt; Both starts with S, yeah.\n\n57\n00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.440\nYou don't like it?\n\n58\n00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.567\n&gt;&gt; Well.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n59\n00:02:24.567 --> 00:02:26.550\n&gt;&gt; I'm not liking swap for\n\n60\n00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.750\nsubstitution because I'm liking swap for\ntransposition.\n\n61\n00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.510\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So, if I'm liking swapping for\n\n62\n00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.160\ntransposition because when we transpose\nwe're swapping blocks, right?\n\n63\n00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.340\nSo if we use the adjective swapping for\nwhat we do for transposing.\n\n64\n00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.056\nThen if we're substituting could we\nmaybe use another thought process\n\n65\n00:02:48.056 --> 00:02:54.066\nthat perhaps in our last episode we\nspent quite a bit of time talking about?\n\n66\n00:02:54.066 --> 00:02:59.019\nMaybe we could think about instead of\nswapping, maybe we could think about\n\n67\n00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.967\nsomething with a circle and\na plus or an x in the middle of it.\n\n68\n00:03:02.967 --> 00:03:03.641\nWhat would that be?\n\n69\n00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:04.465\n&gt;&gt; Xori.\n\n70\n00:03:04.465 --> 00:03:08.900\n&gt;&gt; Xori, right, so, if we are going\nto do substitution, could we say that\n\n71\n00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.300\nsubstitution essentially is accomplished\nby Xori in the plain text with the key?\n\n72\n00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because that's\n\n73\n00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.100\nbasically what we think of\na substitution as being.\n\n74\n00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.060\nWe XOR the plain-text message with a key,\nand\n\n75\n00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.190\nby doing that,\nthat's what we're doing for substitution.\n\n76\n00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.270\nWhereas transposition is gonna be\nthe idea of swapping blocks of text.\n\n77\n00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.606\n&gt;&gt; Okay, am I losing this game.\n\n78\n00:03:29.606 --> 00:03:31.280\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, you're not losing the game.\n\n79\n00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.495\nWe haven't started playing yet-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n80\n00:03:32.495 --> 00:03:33.980\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because this was like the warm up\n\n81\n00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.050\nround-\n&gt;&gt; Man.\n\n82\n00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.580\n&gt;&gt; So that way you could help\nme to help everybody understand.\n\n83\n00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.620\nSo, if we think about that, right?\n\n84\n00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.560\nIf we're comfortable with those\ntwo thought processes we'll\n\n85\n00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.220\nhave explanations, right?\n\n86\n00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.640\nThen what we think about substitution,\nwhat we wanna remember\n\n87\n00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.120\nis the idea that we have to bring in this\nconcept of this exclusive work, right?\n\n88\n00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.590\nSo, help me then to explain it cuz maybe\nsomebody hasn't sen the last episode,\n\n89\n00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.940\nright, and maybe they haven't watched the\nwhole conversation that we wet through on\n\n90\n00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.550\nbinary math on XOR, the binary AND,\nthe binary OR, the exclusive or.\n\n91\n00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.570\nSo the game begins now, right?\n\n92\n00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:15.190\nAll right, so help then for\n200 points, right and a gold key.\n\n93\n00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.170\nHelp me to understand, define for\nus if you will, paint a picture\n\n94\n00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.430\nof somebody without a chart, without\nall the ones and zeroes and everything.\n\n95\n00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.840\nHelp us to walk through, and\njust help us to understand,\n\n96\n00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.020\nthe concept of the binary OR,\nessentially the exclusive OR.\n\n97\n00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.720\nHow would we describe to somebody,\ncuz we just said,\n\n98\n00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.610\nsubstitution is essentially XORing the\nplain text message with the key, right?\n\n99\n00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.870\nSo let's help everybody to understand,\n\n100\n00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.080\nif they haven't seen the episode yet,\nwhat we mean by XORing.\n\n101\n00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.880\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; Let's walk through it.\n\n102\n00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.240\n&gt;&gt; If this, then that.\n\n103\n00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.680\nMaybe that would be my most basic.\n\n104\n00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.890\n&gt;&gt; Okay, if this than that.\n\n105\n00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.090\nI like that, let's build on that.\n\n106\n00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.130\nSo if this, than that,\n\n107\n00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.330\nso if this is equal to something-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n108\n00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.300\n&gt;&gt; Then that would be\nequal to something else,\n\n109\n00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.220\nwe probably just wanna expand that, right.\n\n110\n00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.560\nJust because we know we kind\nof imply if this then that.\n\n111\n00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.230\nSays if this is equal to or not equal to,\nthen that is equal to or not equal to.\n\n112\n00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.000\nBut let's just make sure we\nstate that unequivocally so\n\n113\n00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.910\neverybody understands that.\n\n114\n00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.340\nWe don't wanna imply things and\nnot be clear, right?\n\n115\n00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.850\nSo I like that,\nit's a great way of thinking about it.\n\n116\n00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:15.740\nSo 200 points for you and\n\n117\n00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.420\nthe gold key because that's a great\nway of thinking about that.\n\n118\n00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.840\nIf you look on the back it actually\nhas Cherokee's name on it but\n\n119\n00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.340\nwe can't show that to you cuz it's secret.\n\n120\n00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.800\nIt's her private key, right?\n\n121\n00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.880\nSo there we go.\n\n122\n00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.780\nSecond private key, you have two.\n\n123\n00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.320\nNow you can be like doubly private,\nthat's great.\n\n124\n00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.660\nWell, if we think about if this then that,\nas essentially a way of thinking about\n\n125\n00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.960\nbinary exoring, then when we do the\ncomparison for the plain text, right, with\n\n126\n00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.780\nthe key, are we gonna have essentially two\nseparate values that we have to compare?\n\n127\n00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.420\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So one of them will be the plain text,\n\n128\n00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.090\nwe can think of it essentially as just a\nline of items, whatever they are, letters,\n\n129\n00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.440\nnumbers, whatever they may be.\n\n130\n00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.410\nAnd then another item, which is the key\nthat we're gonna use for the comparison.\n\n131\n00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.530\nAnd we're then gonna compare\nthe two using probably a set of\n\n132\n00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:59.940\nrules of some kind, right?\n\n133\n00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.990\nAnd those rules then have to be used\nto be able to create something.\n\n134\n00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.540\nWhat's the output of the binary XOR,\nessentially the XOR?\n\n135\n00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:08.530\n&gt;&gt; A resultant.\n\n136\n00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:09.373\n&gt;&gt; A resultant, right.\n\n137\n00:06:09.373 --> 00:06:11.326\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So the resultant, right,\n\n138\n00:06:11.326 --> 00:06:16.131\nis gonna be the output of the comparison\nbetween the two that's then going to give\n\n139\n00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:18.604\nus the ability to be\nable to either send and\n\n140\n00:06:18.604 --> 00:06:21.521\ntransmit that information\nin a secure fashion.\n\n141\n00:06:21.521 --> 00:06:26.010\nOr to use that comparison to then be able\nto drive some sort of activity, right.\n\n142\n00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.791\nJust depending on what we wanna do.\n\n143\n00:06:26.791 --> 00:06:28.933\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So, the idea behind this, and\n\n144\n00:06:28.933 --> 00:06:33.200\nthe reasons why we use substitution and\nwe use transposition,\n\n145\n00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.145\nis that if we do a single round\nwe get essentially resultant\n\n146\n00:06:37.145 --> 00:06:39.904\nthat is directly related to what we did.\n\n147\n00:06:39.904 --> 00:06:44.529\nAnd we talked about also that fact\nwhen we went through binary XOR,\n\n148\n00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:48.578\nthat binary XOR unlike binary and\nthe binary OR function,\n\n149\n00:06:48.578 --> 00:06:53.810\nthe two separate ones are not reversible\nbut the binary XOR is reversible.\n\n150\n00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:54.464\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n151\n00:06:54.464 --> 00:06:58.185\nthis is something we have to take note of\nand think about, because if we do only one\n\n152\n00:06:58.185 --> 00:07:00.732\nround of substitution or\none round of transposition.\n\n153\n00:07:00.732 --> 00:07:04.136\nAnd we have a direct\nability to reverse it and\n\n154\n00:07:04.136 --> 00:07:07.454\ngo right back to the plain text and\nthe key.\n\n155\n00:07:07.454 --> 00:07:10.779\nAnd we don't in any way\nscramble those eggs up,\n\n156\n00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:13.700\nto use your analogy from a prior episode.\n\n157\n00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.990\nI'm liking that more and\nmore as I use that.\n\n158\n00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.510\n&gt;&gt; I think I know where you're going\nwith this but I'm going to wait.\n\n159\n00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.710\n&gt;&gt; We're going to do rounds\n&gt;&gt; Multiple permutations.\n\n160\n00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.250\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna do multiple permutations,\nwhich are commonly called rounds.\n\n161\n00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.300\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Just call them rounds.\n\n162\n00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.180\nBut it's, it's exactly what you described.\n\n163\n00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.520\nWe're going to use rounds,\nmultiple runs or\n\n164\n00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:33.460\niterations through the substitution and\ntransposition in order to obfuscate,\n\n165\n00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:34.580\nto create-\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n166\n00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.420\n&gt;&gt; Confusion and diffusion.\n\n167\n00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:37.250\n&gt;&gt; I'm good at that.\n\n168\n00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:38.270\n&gt;&gt; And you are.\n\n169\n00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:41.910\nBut bring in confusion, diffusion,\nand, or the avalanche effect, right?\n\n170\n00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.790\nEssentially the three other vocabulary\nterms we've talked about in\n\n171\n00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:45.670\nprior episodes.\n\n172\n00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:49.333\nThis is why we keep reminding you at the\nbeginning of some of these episodes to go\n\n173\n00:07:49.333 --> 00:07:52.886\nback and look at some of the others\nsequentially because we're pulling back\n\n174\n00:07:52.886 --> 00:07:54.844\nthat knowledge and we are bringing it up.\n\n175\n00:07:54.844 --> 00:07:58.191\nBut we define those terms for\nyou early on, so that you can use them and\n\n176\n00:07:58.191 --> 00:07:59.713\nrefer to them as we go, right?\n\n177\n00:07:59.713 --> 00:08:02.982\nIt's very important to be able to do that,\nmay even wanna have.\n\n178\n00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:05.942\nThe show notes from those episode\nwhich just to remind you here in case\n\n179\n00:08:05.942 --> 00:08:07.500\nyou haven't seen them yet.\n\n180\n00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:11.685\nWe have a three or five page Word document\nwe put together with all the vocabulary.\n\n181\n00:08:11.685 --> 00:08:15.149\nAll the definitions to go through in\nthat show is downloadable it's part\n\n182\n00:08:15.149 --> 00:08:16.330\nof the show notes.\n\n183\n00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.915\nEncourage you that if you don't\nalready have that, get that, and\n\n184\n00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:21.410\ngo through these episodes with\nthat vocabulary in front of you so\n\n185\n00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:24.319\nthat when we talk about stuff like this\nyou can refer to it if you're not sure\n\n186\n00:08:24.319 --> 00:08:27.030\nwhat we're talking about and\nyou're comfortable with it, right?\n\n187\n00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:29.170\nBe very important to have that.\n\n188\n00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:31.271\nFlashcards obviously work good for that\nas well, as we've talked about before.\n\n189\n00:08:31.271 --> 00:08:35.143\nSo, we're gonna go through these multiple\nrounds like you were suggesting,\n\n190\n00:08:35.143 --> 00:08:38.810\nbecause we're gonna create confusion and\ndiffusion in the system.\n\n191\n00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:41.360\nAnd as results can be harder for\nus to do the reverse engineering,\n\n192\n00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.260\nand get all the way back, unless we\nhave all of those things lined up,\n\n193\n00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.560\nall of the pieces,\nthe random initialization vector,\n\n194\n00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.050\nthe injection of randomness that we've\ntalked about, and we have the key,\n\n195\n00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:55.240\nwhich we may or may not have if we're\na bad actor we hopefully don't have it.\n\n196\n00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.681\nFor a good actor we hopefully do.\n\n197\n00:08:56.681 --> 00:09:00.369\nAnd, we're gonna obviously then get the\nplain text back from the cipher text, so\n\n198\n00:09:00.369 --> 00:09:02.560\nit's important to know\nwe can reverse this, but\n\n199\n00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.874\nit's also important to know that we\ndon't wanna just have one reverse and\n\n200\n00:09:05.874 --> 00:09:09.777\nthen we're good, we wanna go through these\niterations to make it more complicated for\n\n201\n00:09:09.777 --> 00:09:14.050\nthe threat actor essentially to be able to\ngo and say, I wanna get that plain text.\n\n202\n00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:17.679\nAnd I wanna get and\nunwind that message and understand it.\n\n203\n00:09:17.679 --> 00:09:19.311\nI said we'd throw a new turn on here for\n\n204\n00:09:19.311 --> 00:09:21.410\nyou which is something\ncalled the key schedule.\n\n205\n00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:24.410\nSo the key schedule is actually\na very simple concept.\n\n206\n00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:28.620\nBut you don't often hear it referred to\noutside of formal academic conversations\n\n207\n00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:32.120\nabout cryptography because we just\ndon't really talk about it and\n\n208\n00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:36.580\nuse the formal name, even though we\ntalk about this function all the time.\n\n209\n00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:39.101\nAnd we just mention them indirectly\nwhen we talk about the rounds that we\n\n210\n00:09:39.101 --> 00:09:40.290\nwill go through.\n\n211\n00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:44.551\nSo the key schedule is the idea in\nsymmetric algorithms is where we see\n\n212\n00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:45.790\nthis use.\n\n213\n00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:50.840\nIt's an algorithm function that, given the\nkey, calculates what we call the sub keys\n\n214\n00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.174\nfor all these rounds of\nthe various ex-ORing or\n\n215\n00:09:54.174 --> 00:09:59.780\nthe exclusive-ORing that we will do right\nas we go through doing each subkey.\n\n216\n00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:00.670\nA unique key for\n\n217\n00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:05.180\neach round is generated to do the further\ncomparison, further confuse and obfuscate.\n\n218\n00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:09.369\nSo this key schedule is the actual\nalgorithm it's used to generate these\n\n219\n00:10:09.369 --> 00:10:13.078\nsubkeys for each unique round used\none time from the master key,\n\n220\n00:10:13.078 --> 00:10:16.786\nthe initial private key or\npublic key or whatever we're using,\n\n221\n00:10:16.786 --> 00:10:19.412\ndepending on the particulars\nof the system.\n\n222\n00:10:19.412 --> 00:10:21.745\nIn a symmetric system\nit's a private key only,\n\n223\n00:10:21.745 --> 00:10:24.543\nin a asymmetric system we have\na public private key pair,\n\n224\n00:10:24.543 --> 00:10:27.770\nwe in theory could use either one\ndepending on what we're doing.\n\n225\n00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:31.670\nIf we're digitally signing or\nwe are encrypting, or perhaps both as you\n\n226\n00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:35.140\nreminded us of in a prior episode,\nwe may do a hybrid solution.\n\n227\n00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:38.960\nSymmetrically encrypt the message and then\nasymmetrically secure the key to securely\n\n228\n00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:43.080\ntransmit Alice's key to Bob so\nwe can do that securely.\n\n229\n00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.390\nOne thing we want to talk about\nsymmetric encryption up until now, but\n\n230\n00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:47.020\nit's worth mentioning here.\n\n231\n00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:51.520\nSymmetric encryption, single key,\nprivate key only algorithms, are much,\n\n232\n00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:52.810\nmuch quicker.\n\n233\n00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:57.770\nOrders of magnitude faster to do bulk\nencryption than asymmetrical public,\n\n234\n00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:59.950\nprivate key systems are.\n\n235\n00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:00.864\nThere's many reasons for that.\n\n236\n00:11:00.864 --> 00:11:02.820\nOne of them is probably the obvious one.\n\n237\n00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.830\nTwice as many keys, more complex,\nmore things to do, slows things down.\n\n238\n00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:10.296\nSo when we use symmetric systems,\nwhich we use to do bulk encryption,\n\n239\n00:11:10.296 --> 00:11:14.117\nwe're very quick to encrypt, but\nwe know there's a fundamental weakness or\n\n240\n00:11:14.117 --> 00:11:18.263\nflaw potentially in the fact that we must\nprotect the key and securely transmit it.\n\n241\n00:11:18.263 --> 00:11:21.320\nSo Cherokee pointed out one\nof our prior conversations.\n\n242\n00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:25.116\nIt was an incredibly important\ninsight that she shared with us and\n\n243\n00:11:25.116 --> 00:11:27.885\nthat she gave us to think\nabout in that episode.\n\n244\n00:11:27.885 --> 00:11:31.200\nWhich is, hey, one of the ways we\ncould securely transmit the key.\n\n245\n00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.830\nThis was the Bob and Alice conversation\nabout symmetric encryption that we engaged\n\n246\n00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:36.690\nin with the diagram, right?\n\n247\n00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:40.504\nAnd when I asked her that we could\npotentially overcome this weakness.\n\n248\n00:11:40.504 --> 00:11:43.940\nOne of the things she said is, hey,\nlet's do a risk analysis on this.\n\n249\n00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:48.430\nAnd if we looked at the opportunity for\nus to not just symmetrically transmit but\n\n250\n00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:52.330\nto symmetrically encrypt and\nthen asymmetrically re-encrypt, and\n\n251\n00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:53.700\nthen transmit securely.\n\n252\n00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.930\nAnd it's a brilliant\nobservation on her part,\n\n253\n00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:58.990\nbecause it's the exact\nsolution that we engage in\n\n254\n00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:03.440\nto overcome not just the private key\nonly weakness of secure transmission.\n\n255\n00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.580\nBut the speed issue associated\nwith bulk encryption\n\n256\n00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.880\nbecause we have to encrypt\nhuge volumes of data.\n\n257\n00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.630\nAsymmetrical way encrypting\nit is gonna take a very\n\n258\n00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:15.040\nlong time compared to\nsymmetrically encrypting it.\n\n259\n00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.820\nSo from a performance stand point\nit's gonna be much better to use\n\n260\n00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:19.547\nsymmetric encryption of bulk encrypt.\n\n261\n00:12:19.547 --> 00:12:24.534\nTake the private key, right it's a good\nthing we have multiple sets of keys here,\n\n262\n00:12:24.534 --> 00:12:25.075\nright?\n\n263\n00:12:25.075 --> 00:12:25.956\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we're to take\n\n264\n00:12:25.956 --> 00:12:27.197\nour private key, all right?\n\n265\n00:12:27.197 --> 00:12:30.610\nAnd we are gonna encrypt our data, right?\n\n266\n00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:32.971\nSo, if we take our data.\n\n267\n00:12:32.971 --> 00:12:36.400\nYou always gotta have visuals,\notherwise it just doesn't work, right?\n\n268\n00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.802\nTake our data, encrypt it with our private\nkey, so now our data is going to be,\n\n269\n00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:43.826\nas you can see here,\nprotected with our private key.\n\n270\n00:12:43.826 --> 00:12:47.960\nWell, that's good, but then we gotta\nseparate the data and send it, right?\n\n271\n00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:51.160\nAnd we have to keep the key, and\nif we don't give somebody the key,\n\n272\n00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.440\nthey can't unencrypt the data,\nbut what Cherokee was saying,\n\n273\n00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:59.100\nhey let's overcome that, let's do this and\nlet's re-encrypt this whole thing,\n\n274\n00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:00.820\nwill you give me that\npiece of paper over there?\n\n275\n00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:01.930\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Let's re-encrypt\n\n276\n00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:03.680\nthis whole thing, right?\n\n277\n00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:08.760\nAnd lets encrypt this whole thing\nwith our public/private key pair.\n\n278\n00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.066\nGive me another key.\n\n279\n00:13:10.066 --> 00:13:12.600\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; All right and so what we're gonna do is\n\n280\n00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:16.774\nwe're gonna encrypt the data that was\nencrypted with the private key and\n\n281\n00:13:16.774 --> 00:13:20.963\nthe private key that encrypted the data\nwith a public/public key pair.\n\n282\n00:13:20.963 --> 00:13:23.960\nAnd what we're then gonna\ndo is separate the keys.\n\n283\n00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.430\nSo we'll talk more about this in\n\n284\n00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:27.910\nan upcoming episode with\nasymmetric encryption.\n\n285\n00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:31.530\nBut basically with the public\nprivate key pair, what we do is,\n\n286\n00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:32.340\nyou can probably guess.\n\n287\n00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:33.310\nThe public key is public.\n\n288\n00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:35.742\nIt's made available.\nThe private key is still kept secure,\n\n289\n00:13:35.742 --> 00:13:37.080\nstill kept private.\n\n290\n00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.960\nSo I'm gonna keep my private key.\n\n291\n00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.987\nI'm gonna use my public key\nto encrypt the data, right?\n\n292\n00:13:42.987 --> 00:13:45.546\nIf I do that, what happens?\n\n293\n00:13:45.546 --> 00:13:50.180\nWell, I send it and then what does\nsomebody have to have to unecrypt?\n\n294\n00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.120\nThey have to have the private key.\n\n295\n00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:51.741\nThat's not a good solution.\n\n296\n00:13:51.741 --> 00:13:53.189\nWe're back to the same issue.\n\n297\n00:13:53.189 --> 00:13:56.546\nSo most people think,\nI'll use the public key to encrypt.\n\n298\n00:13:56.546 --> 00:13:58.340\nNo, we don't use public key to encrypt.\n\n299\n00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.570\nThe way we do it with asymmetric\nencryption is the following.\n\n300\n00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:05.720\nWe use our private key to encrypt, but\nwe don't send and expose the private key.\n\n301\n00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.020\nBecause what we have to understand\nabout asymmetric encryption\n\n302\n00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.860\nis that the keys\nare asymmetrically matched.\n\n303\n00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.493\nEssentially, mathematically,\nthey're paired.\n\n304\n00:14:14.493 --> 00:14:17.270\nSo either key can be used\nto validate the other.\n\n305\n00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:20.990\nAnd one key's used for one function, and\nthe other key's the exact opposite and\n\n306\n00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:22.560\nused to undo that function.\n\n307\n00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:27.650\nAnd so if I encrypt with my private key,\nI can unencrypted with my public key.\n\n308\n00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:30.189\nIf I want to have that happen,\nor digitally sign, right?\n\n309\n00:14:30.189 --> 00:14:34.250\nSo the question becomes,\nwhich key do I use for which activity.\n\n310\n00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:35.310\nAnd we'll get more into this later.\n\n311\n00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:37.560\nNot worried about you getting\nall the specifics now.\n\n312\n00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.190\nI'm just showing you that\nwith asymmetric encryption,\n\n313\n00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:44.690\nif I encrypt with the private key, anybody\ncan decrypt with the public key, right?\n\n314\n00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:47.775\nAnd so what we actually do is we\ndon't encrypt with the private key,\n\n315\n00:14:47.775 --> 00:14:51.348\nwe digitally sign with the private key to\nprove who we are because everybody can\n\n316\n00:14:51.348 --> 00:14:53.372\nvalidate our identity with the public key.\n\n317\n00:14:53.372 --> 00:14:58.313\nBut if we wanna encrypt, right,\nwe can encrypt asymmetrically, and\n\n318\n00:14:58.313 --> 00:15:01.330\nif we use our public key to encrypt.\n\n319\n00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.260\nOnly the person that has\nthe private key can decrypt.\n\n320\n00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.780\nSo if we go into long term storage, and\n\n321\n00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:09.150\nwe wanna be the only one\nthat accesses this data,\n\n322\n00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:13.250\nencrypt it with a public key, I'm the only\nholder of the private key in theory\n\n323\n00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:17.270\nas a result I'm the one who can unlock\nthe encryption and bring the data back.\n\n324\n00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:19.988\nAnd in a hybrid system that\nmaybe what we wanna do.\n\n325\n00:15:19.988 --> 00:15:23.780\nIf we wanna be able to transmit securely\nthen we have to worry about which key we\n\n326\n00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:24.890\nuse and how we do that.\n\n327\n00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:27.922\nAnd we'll talk more about this\nin asymmetric encryption, but\n\n328\n00:15:27.922 --> 00:15:30.163\nthe point is we're gonna\nhave options right?\n\n329\n00:15:30.163 --> 00:15:33.561\nAnd as we combine the two together,\nwe're gonna then be able to use\n\n330\n00:15:33.561 --> 00:15:36.899\nthe outcome of that process and\nthose options, put back my data so\n\n331\n00:15:36.899 --> 00:15:40.212\nthat I have it for another day when\nwe want to do yet another demo.\n\n332\n00:15:40.212 --> 00:15:42.938\nI'm gonna put it in the special data\nholder here on my laptop right.\n\n333\n00:15:42.938 --> 00:15:44.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which is my\n\n334\n00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:45.950\nlittle mouse pad area there.\n\n335\n00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:50.920\nI'm gonna store our keys here securely\nas well in our Nefego HSM TPM key\n\n336\n00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:53.650\nvault tabletop solution here.\n\n337\n00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:56.070\nBut the idea would be that we're\ngonna actually use a hybrid solution.\n\n338\n00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:58.152\nWe're gonna talk more about\nthat in upcoming episodes.\n\n339\n00:15:58.152 --> 00:16:01.027\nBut with symmetric encryption,\nwe have this issue.\n\n340\n00:16:01.027 --> 00:16:04.177\nIt's very fast, but then we gotta\nworry about who gets the key.\n\n341\n00:16:04.177 --> 00:16:08.451\nIf we then Put the data into long term\nstorage and we encrypt the data and\n\n342\n00:16:08.451 --> 00:16:13.170\nthe key that was used to encrypt the data,\nagain or even just encrypt the key.\n\n343\n00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:17.580\nEither way, using an asymetric system\nwe can securely transfer the key and\n\n344\n00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.710\nthat's gonna overcome this issue for\nus, right?\n\n345\n00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:22.620\nSo we're gonna symmetrically and\nasymmetrically encrypt the solutions and\n\n346\n00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:25.460\nthat's gonna be of interest to\nus at some point in the future.\n\n347\n00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:29.020\nBut before we get there, we do have a few\nthings we have to talk about first.\n\n348\n00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:31.160\nSo two types of symmetric algorithms.\n\n349\n00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.930\nWe have block and stream algorithms.\n\n350\n00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:35.570\nIn other words,\nwe commonly call them ciphers by the way.\n\n351\n00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:37.360\nSo block and stream ciphers.\n\n352\n00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:41.210\nHow, in other words, in a symmetric\nsystem do we implement algorithms\n\n353\n00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:43.010\nthat allow us to do the encryption?\n\n354\n00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:46.630\nWhat are the mathematical formulas, the\npiece of the cryptosystem that actually\n\n355\n00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:50.670\ndoes the encryption and decryption, and\nsets up the rules of the structure?\n\n356\n00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:53.310\nWhat kinds of algorithms or\nciphers do we use?\n\n357\n00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:55.380\nWe have two types, block and cipher.\n\n358\n00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:55.955\nBlock and cipher.\n\n359\n00:16:55.955 --> 00:16:58.388\nBlock, cipher and\nstream cipher algorithms.\n\n360\n00:16:58.388 --> 00:17:00.563\nAnd we're gonna talk a little\nbit about them now, or\n\n361\n00:17:00.563 --> 00:17:02.596\nat least begin our\nconversation about them now.\n\n362\n00:17:02.596 --> 00:17:05.540\nI wanna talk about block algorithms first.\n\n363\n00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.150\nAnd you've heard me talk about\nthese in other episodes.\n\n364\n00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:10.670\nBlocks, very common, so is the stream.\n\n365\n00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:15.460\nBlock algorithms allow us to be\nable to set up a scenario where\n\n366\n00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:17.100\nI'm given a traditional block size.\n\n367\n00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:19.256\n64 bits, 128 bits.\n\n368\n00:17:19.256 --> 00:17:20.944\nThose are the two most common block sizes.\n\n369\n00:17:20.944 --> 00:17:23.570\n256 bits in some cases.\n\n370\n00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:28.290\nWe put that amount of data into\na block and we operate on the block.\n\n371\n00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:30.482\nCan I have that piece of paper back for\njust one more second?\n\n372\n00:17:30.482 --> 00:17:32.560\nWe're gonna use this to\nrepresent our block.\n\n373\n00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.820\nSo if this was our block and\n\n374\n00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:38.070\nwe had to fill the block up with\ndata the way we've done here,\n\n375\n00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:43.000\nin order to be able to process it, then\nthis would be one block in a block cipher.\n\n376\n00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.130\nAnd we would operate on this and\nwe would encrypt or\n\n377\n00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:48.410\ndecrypt this entire block or set of data.\n\n378\n00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:49.940\nBut until we fill the block up,\n\n379\n00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:52.860\nuntil we fill the box up,\nessentially, we don't operate on it.\n\n380\n00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:57.300\nSo block ciphers are slower\nthan stream ciphers, right?\n\n381\n00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:58.500\nBecause they are asynchronous.\n\n382\n00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.900\nThey are not gonna work\ncontinuously in a stream or\n\n383\n00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:05.555\nsynchronously, linear processing of every\nblock as they come through the system.\n\n384\n00:18:05.555 --> 00:18:08.735\nBut rather, they're gonna fill up and\nwait until they're full.\n\n385\n00:18:08.735 --> 00:18:10.832\nAnd then they're gonna move\ndown the assembly line, right?\n\n386\n00:18:10.832 --> 00:18:12.898\nAnd that's how we're gonna process them.\n\n387\n00:18:12.898 --> 00:18:17.709\nSo block ciphers are going to run slower\nthan stream cipher implementations and\n\n388\n00:18:17.709 --> 00:18:19.013\nsymmetric systems.\n\n389\n00:18:19.013 --> 00:18:22.449\nBecause streams are working on every\nbit in almost real time in a sense\n\n390\n00:18:22.449 --> 00:18:23.645\nthat they're linear.\n\n391\n00:18:23.645 --> 00:18:25.435\nThey just move through on a conveyor belt.\n\n392\n00:18:25.435 --> 00:18:27.420\nAnd we operate on each individual bit.\n\n393\n00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:30.890\nSo it's gonna be different based on how\nwe implement and how we approach, right?\n\n394\n00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:33.112\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I kind of have a thing for\nbaskets.\n\n395\n00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:35.719\nI don't know why, it's the truth.\n\n396\n00:18:35.719 --> 00:18:36.916\nAnd I have kids.\n\n397\n00:18:36.916 --> 00:18:39.174\nAnd so their toys are all over\nthe place and everything, so\n\n398\n00:18:39.174 --> 00:18:41.180\nwe're essentially filling\nup these baskets.\n\n399\n00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:45.644\nAnd earlier when you had mentioned, yeah,\nyou had talked about the 128 bit blocks.\n\n400\n00:18:45.644 --> 00:18:51.902\nSo what if I had a string of data and\nit was 1,280 bytes and\n\n401\n00:18:51.902 --> 00:18:57.567\nI have 100 baskets and\nI put 128 in each equally?\n\n402\n00:18:57.567 --> 00:19:00.086\nWell, I guess I did\na number incorrectly there.\n\n403\n00:19:00.086 --> 00:19:02.187\nBut if I had extra left over-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] If you had extra left over.\n\n404\n00:19:02.187 --> 00:19:03.071\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n405\n00:19:03.071 --> 00:19:06.282\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you hah 1,400 bits of data.\n\n406\n00:19:06.282 --> 00:19:11.526\nBut only ten baskets to put it in.\n\n407\n00:19:11.526 --> 00:19:14.629\nAnd it was 128 bits per\nbaskets you'd have left over.\n\n408\n00:19:14.629 --> 00:19:17.612\nAnd you'd have to either get more\nbaskets or you would have to,\n\n409\n00:19:17.612 --> 00:19:20.934\nwhen you ran out and bought extra baskets,\nif you bought too many, and\n\n410\n00:19:20.934 --> 00:19:24.618\nyou had a basket that was half full,\nwe'd have to do what's called padding.\n\n411\n00:19:24.618 --> 00:19:28.761\nWe'd have to add some extra toys\nfrom the neighbor or I don't know.\n\n412\n00:19:28.761 --> 00:19:29.629\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Go out and\n\n413\n00:19:29.629 --> 00:19:33.000\nbuy some dollar store toys or whatever,\nbut we'd have to pad them essentially.\n\n414\n00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.640\nPut filter and fluff in there\nthat's not really legitimate,\n\n415\n00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.305\nthat we don't care about,\nfrom the data perspective.\n\n416\n00:19:38.305 --> 00:19:42.175\nBut that is important so\nthat we can round out the basket.\n\n417\n00:19:42.175 --> 00:19:44.305\nBecause the basket has to be full for\nus to process.\n\n418\n00:19:44.305 --> 00:19:45.430\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n[LAUGH]\n\n419\n00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:46.503\n&gt;&gt; Right, so that would be what we would\n\n420\n00:19:46.503 --> 00:19:48.305\ncall it, and\nthere's a legitimate name for that.\n\n421\n00:19:48.305 --> 00:19:49.175\nWe call that padding.\n\n422\n00:19:49.175 --> 00:19:52.900\nWe actually add extra bits into\nwhatever the last block is in theory.\n\n423\n00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:57.040\nAt the end, if we don't have enough\nbits left over to fill it up, and\n\n424\n00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.140\nwe would call that padding.\n\n425\n00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:59.190\nSo, that's what we do.\n\n426\n00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.941\nSo, boys and girls,\nwhen you put your toys away,\n\n427\n00:20:01.941 --> 00:20:04.276\nalways borrow extra toys from your\nfriend and throw them in yours.\n\n428\n00:20:04.276 --> 00:20:07.770\nSo that way you die with the most toys and\nyou're happy.\n\n429\n00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:10.900\nAll right, so when we think\nabout block algorithms, right?\n\n430\n00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:11.790\nWhat are some examples?\n\n431\n00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:14.950\nSo, if I said you,\ngive me some examples of block algorithms,\n\n432\n00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:17.270\nwhat are some of the things\nyou may thing about?\n\n433\n00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:19.560\nGot any ideas of some-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] I have a nice list here.\n\n434\n00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:23.910\nI've got my DES, triple DES,\nAES, blowfish, two fish.\n\n435\n00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:25.984\nI think idea's on there too, yeah.\n\n436\n00:20:25.984 --> 00:20:26.768\n&gt;&gt; Idea's there?\n\n437\n00:20:26.768 --> 00:20:28.796\n&gt;&gt; Yep, skip jack, serpent.\n\n438\n00:20:28.796 --> 00:20:30.765\nI haven't heard of serpent,\nI'm excited about this one.\n\n439\n00:20:30.765 --> 00:20:31.846\n&gt;&gt; Serpent, okay, so\nwe'll talk about serpent.\n\n440\n00:20:31.846 --> 00:20:34.402\nWhat about the one at the top of your list\nthat you keep skipping over cuz you don't\n\n441\n00:20:34.402 --> 00:20:35.242\nknow how to pronounce it?\n\n442\n00:20:35.242 --> 00:20:36.765\nHow would that be?\n\n443\n00:20:36.765 --> 00:20:37.825\n&gt;&gt; You mentioned this name earlier.\n\n444\n00:20:37.825 --> 00:20:38.920\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n\n445\n00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:41.150\n&gt;&gt; It's, I wanna say German, Feistel?\n\n446\n00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:43.150\n&gt;&gt; So, very good, so the Feistel network,\n\n447\n00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:45.740\nwhich is what we commonly\nhear it referred to as.\n\n448\n00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:48.582\nWe also hear it called the Feistel\nfunction or the Feistel cipher.\n\n449\n00:20:48.582 --> 00:20:49.501\nHorst Feistel,\n\n450\n00:20:49.501 --> 00:20:53.900\nas I mentioned in a previous episode\nis the gentleman who's behind that.\n\n451\n00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.430\nAnd that is,\nalthough we don't often refer to it and\n\n452\n00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:58.880\ndon't often give credit\nwhere credit is due,\n\n453\n00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.290\nis actually underlying most of the other\nalgorithms that you just talked about.\n\n454\n00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:04.290\nBecause we implement the Feistel function.\n\n455\n00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:04.970\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; In\n\n456\n00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:06.790\nmost of those algorithms in one form or\nanother.\n\n457\n00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:09.780\nWe're gonna talk some more about\nthat as we go through them.\n\n458\n00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:11.228\nWe're actually gonna do a quick deep dive.\n\n459\n00:21:11.228 --> 00:21:13.094\n&gt;&gt; I really don't know if it's German.\n\n460\n00:21:13.094 --> 00:21:14.294\nIt just sounded like that to me.\n\n461\n00:21:14.294 --> 00:21:15.657\nSo don't write that in your notes.\n\n462\n00:21:15.657 --> 00:21:17.729\n&gt;&gt; Close, close, right, so\nwe're gonna do a deep dive.\n\n463\n00:21:17.729 --> 00:21:21.440\nThere may be a little Hungarian or Czech\nor something in there as well, who knows?\n\n464\n00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:25.047\nBut very interesting gentleman, if you\ndon't know anything about Horst Feistel,\n\n465\n00:21:25.047 --> 00:21:27.710\nmay be worth your time to Google and\nread up a little bit on him.\n\n466\n00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:32.830\nWe're not gonna share all the interesting\nnuggets that go historically with him.\n\n467\n00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:34.750\nBut he is a very, again, very big,\n\n468\n00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:38.480\nvery important figure in a lot of\nwhat we talk about with cryptography.\n\n469\n00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.184\nThe work he did underlies, as I said,\n\n470\n00:21:40.184 --> 00:21:42.649\nmany of the modern algorithms\nthat we talk about when.\n\n471\n00:21:42.649 --> 00:21:46.353\nWe talk about Feistel functions as being\nat the heart of most of these block\n\n472\n00:21:46.353 --> 00:21:47.080\nalgorithms.\n\n473\n00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:50.240\nSo a lot of that work has\nactually been taken and\n\n474\n00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.480\nused as the building blocks literally for\n\n475\n00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.730\nall of these newer implementations of\nthe algorithms that we talk about.\n\n476\n00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:58.863\nSo, let's talk a little bit more about\nthe Feistel network, Feistel cipher,\n\n477\n00:21:58.863 --> 00:22:01.808\nFeistel function, whatever you wanna\ncall it, just to give you a better,\n\n478\n00:22:01.808 --> 00:22:03.197\nkind of reference point for this.\n\n479\n00:22:03.197 --> 00:22:04.688\nCuz it is an important little footnote.\n\n480\n00:22:04.688 --> 00:22:07.965\nAnd a little important area that\nwe wanna spend a little on and\n\n481\n00:22:07.965 --> 00:22:09.610\ndig a little deeper on.\n\n482\n00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:13.670\nSo, when we think about how the Feistel\nnetwork works, we think about,\n\n483\n00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:14.600\nas we talked about,\n\n484\n00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:18.510\nsplitting up the blocks of plain text into\nthese baskets as we were talking about.\n\n485\n00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:20.510\nSo we're gonna chunk them or\nbreak them up.\n\n486\n00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:24.849\nBut let's just say, hypothetically,\nfor purposes of our conversation,\n\n487\n00:22:24.849 --> 00:22:27.250\nthat we could evenly split the blocks.\n\n488\n00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:30.115\nSo let's say we just divide\nit in half into two baskets.\n\n489\n00:22:30.115 --> 00:22:31.762\nWhatever the amount of text is,\n\n490\n00:22:31.762 --> 00:22:34.630\nlet's just say we evenly split\nit into two equal parts.\n\n491\n00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:36.330\nWe'll put each into a basket.\n\n492\n00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:38.171\nHowever big the basket is,\nwe're not worried about that right now.\n\n493\n00:22:38.171 --> 00:22:39.003\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n494\n00:22:39.003 --> 00:22:40.489\n&gt;&gt; We'll just split it\nequally into two parts.\n\n495\n00:22:40.489 --> 00:22:44.258\nAnd we term those parts L-0 and R-0.\n\n496\n00:22:44.258 --> 00:22:47.242\nL for left, R for right.\n\n497\n00:22:47.242 --> 00:22:51.264\nZero cuz we always start numbering\nat zero in any system that we use.\n\n498\n00:22:51.264 --> 00:22:52.427\n&gt;&gt; With you so far.\n&gt;&gt; With computers, right?\n\n499\n00:22:52.427 --> 00:22:54.816\nSo we got a left basket,\nwe got a right basket.\n\n500\n00:22:54.816 --> 00:22:57.474\nAnd we're calling our left basket L-0.\n\n501\n00:22:57.474 --> 00:22:59.167\nWe're calling our right basket R-0, okay?\n\n502\n00:22:59.167 --> 00:23:01.570\nSo far so good, right?\n\n503\n00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:04.800\nAnd then as long as the split is equal,\n\n504\n00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.650\nwe're using what is called\na traditional Feistel cipher.\n\n505\n00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:11.760\nRight, so what we would call just\na Feistel cypher, whatever we call\n\n506\n00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:15.440\na traditional, but a normal\nimplementation of the Feistel cypher.\n\n507\n00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:18.340\nRemember Feistel cypher,\nFeistel network, they're all the same,\n\n508\n00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:19.790\nthey're for the same thing.\n\n509\n00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:22.190\nLet's just call it\nthe Feistel cypher just so\n\n510\n00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:27.210\nwe're clear, but we're using a traditional\nimplementation of the Feistel cypher.\n\n511\n00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:29.560\nIf we split the load, the blocks,\n\n512\n00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:34.990\nthe bits Into two distinct\nbaskets of equal size, L-0, R-0.\n\n513\n00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:37.770\nIf we don't, if there's leftover,\nif something's not right,\n\n514\n00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:39.840\nif we don't have the ability\nto do it evenly,\n\n515\n00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.980\nit's an odd amount of data,\nwe have a solution for that.\n\n516\n00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:46.795\nIt's actually called the unbalanced\nFeistel cipher where we have an unbalanced\n\n517\n00:23:46.795 --> 00:23:50.365\nsplit, one basket is essentially\nlarger than the other.\n\n518\n00:23:50.365 --> 00:23:53.265\n&gt;&gt; So the remainder just gets added\nto which one, but how do you tell?\n\n519\n00:23:53.265 --> 00:23:55.779\n&gt;&gt; It's not so much important which\none it winds up in right now.\n\n520\n00:23:55.779 --> 00:23:56.649\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n521\n00:23:56.649 --> 00:23:58.920\n&gt;&gt; We just wanna know that normally\nwe strive for an equal split.\n\n522\n00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:03.389\nAnd if we don't have one, we actually\nhave a specific separate implementation\n\n523\n00:24:03.389 --> 00:24:05.242\ncalled an unbalanced Feistel cipher.\n\n524\n00:24:05.242 --> 00:24:06.251\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; That's really all we wanna\n\n525\n00:24:06.251 --> 00:24:06.755\nknow for now.\n\n526\n00:24:06.755 --> 00:24:10.661\nSo having the two baskets, L-0,\nR-0, equal in our world for\n\n527\n00:24:10.661 --> 00:24:15.151\nthe moment We're now gonna engage in\nwhat's known as the round function.\n\n528\n00:24:15.151 --> 00:24:18.473\nThe round function is commonly\nrefered to just as a capital F for\n\n529\n00:24:18.473 --> 00:24:19.924\nfunction, the capital F.\n\n530\n00:24:19.924 --> 00:24:22.149\nOr sometimes RF for round function, but\n\n531\n00:24:22.149 --> 00:24:25.190\nthe round function is applied\nto both halves, right?\n\n532\n00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:27.699\nSo we're gonna round both halves, L0, R0,\n\n533\n00:24:27.699 --> 00:24:31.780\nand the round function is simply referring\nto this function that we go through\n\n534\n00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:34.573\niteratively as we move\nthrough the Feistel cipher.\n\n535\n00:24:34.573 --> 00:24:38.048\nRemember we talked about the fact we\nwould go through multiple times to create\n\n536\n00:24:38.048 --> 00:24:39.231\nconfusion, diffusion.\n\n537\n00:24:39.231 --> 00:24:44.547\nAnd essentially spread out the information\ndoing our binary xor comparisons,\n\n538\n00:24:44.547 --> 00:24:47.650\nso that we don't leave\nit easily reversible.\n\n539\n00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:49.672\nWe're gonna go through those iterations\nwhere there's multiple rounds.\n\n540\n00:24:49.672 --> 00:24:51.385\nYou called them rounds, and\nit's exactly what we're gonna do.\n\n541\n00:24:51.385 --> 00:24:53.913\nAnd so the Feistel funtions,\n\n542\n00:24:53.913 --> 00:24:59.260\nthe Feistel cipher rather\nincorporates round functions.\n\n543\n00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:02.540\nAnd this is just the number of times we're\ngonna iterate through doing something,\n\n544\n00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:03.970\nhowever many rounds there are.\n\n545\n00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:06.950\nThe details of the round\nfunction whatever we do there,\n\n546\n00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:10.700\nhow we do it,\nexactly the specificity of mechanics.\n\n547\n00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:11.929\nIt varies by implementation of algorithms.\n\n548\n00:25:11.929 --> 00:25:17.110\nThere's a lot of differences there based\non the unique properties of the algorithm.\n\n549\n00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:18.623\nWe're not as concerned\nabout that right now.\n\n550\n00:25:18.623 --> 00:25:21.203\nWe're just concerned about\nunderstanding the broad concepts\n\n551\n00:25:21.203 --> 00:25:22.630\nof the structure Feistel cipher.\n\n552\n00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:28.540\nSo we understand that there is a need to\nsplit the data into different baskets.\n\n553\n00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:31.983\nAnd if the baskets are equal,\nwe call it a Feistel cipher.\n\n554\n00:25:31.983 --> 00:25:35.509\nIf the baskets are unequal size,\nwe call it unbalanced Feistel cipher.\n\n555\n00:25:35.509 --> 00:25:40.230\nAnd we then operate on those baskets using\na round function that iterates a number of\n\n556\n00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:42.210\ntimes, number of rounds.\n\n557\n00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:45.777\nSo you often hear an algorithm referred\nto as being 256-bits with 16 rounds.\n\n558\n00:25:45.777 --> 00:25:49.524\nThat means we're gonna iterate through and\n\n559\n00:25:49.524 --> 00:25:53.480\ndo the Feistel cipher processing 16 times.\n\n560\n00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:57.290\nThat's the number of rounds or the number\nof times around function will be applied.\n\n561\n00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:00.940\nThat's what you often hear or\nwill hear as part of the description.\n\n562\n00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:05.866\nThe output of each round function,\nso essentially what we would call\n\n563\n00:26:05.866 --> 00:26:09.753\nthe resultant as you reminded us of,\nis then xored with the other half.\n\n564\n00:26:09.753 --> 00:26:15.400\nSo we're gonna take the output of the\nround function on L0 on the left basket.\n\n565\n00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:21.020\nAnd the output of that round is gonna\nbe xored into the right basket,\n\n566\n00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:22.802\nR0, and compared.\n\n567\n00:26:22.802 --> 00:26:26.211\nAnd then the output of the right,\ngets moved over to the left.\n\n568\n00:26:26.211 --> 00:26:29.180\n&gt;&gt; This is sounding a lot like\ndata inscription standard.\n\n569\n00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:29.939\nAre we heading that way?\n\n570\n00:26:29.939 --> 00:26:32.460\n&gt;&gt; Well this underlies like I said-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Many of those.\n\n571\n00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:33.081\n&gt;&gt; Many modern outwards.\n\n572\n00:26:33.081 --> 00:26:33.955\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Desk and\n\n573\n00:26:33.955 --> 00:26:35.807\ntriple desk use Feistel ciphers.\n\n574\n00:26:35.807 --> 00:26:36.438\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n575\n00:26:36.438 --> 00:26:39.340\n&gt;&gt; As their base function,\nas do many other algorithms.\n\n576\n00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:43.359\nSo desk works with a little bit of\nmodification basically this way.\n\n577\n00:26:43.359 --> 00:26:48.081\nBecause DES is implemented a little bit\ndifferently than triple DES in a sense\n\n578\n00:26:48.081 --> 00:26:52.741\nthat, DES is a single round, not\nmultiple rounds, but a single endpoint.\n\n579\n00:26:52.741 --> 00:26:56.600\nTriple DES uses three keys, encrypt,\ndecrypt, encrypt again, right?\n\n580\n00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.340\nSo it's just a matter of how we implement.\n\n581\n00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:01.287\nBut essentially the Feistel\nciphers sit at the heart of that.\n\n582\n00:27:01.287 --> 00:27:04.194\nSo it is gonna be an explanation of that,\nand we're gonna get to that but\n\n583\n00:27:04.194 --> 00:27:05.074\nwe're not coming-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n584\n00:27:05.074 --> 00:27:06.324\n&gt;&gt; Episode, we haven't gotten there yet.\n\n585\n00:27:06.324 --> 00:27:09.840\nBut we're gonna do a whole discussion\non desk and go through that as well.\n\n586\n00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:13.080\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm excited, you're filling in\nthe little pieces there that I, yeah.\n\n587\n00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.087\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes when you read books and\n\n588\n00:27:15.087 --> 00:27:16.972\nyou see these diagrams, I said before,\n\n589\n00:27:16.972 --> 00:27:18.647\nI'll bring that book up-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n590\n00:27:18.647 --> 00:27:21.858\n&gt;&gt; Here in show, because there's a little\nbit that's lacking that you're filling in\n\n591\n00:27:21.858 --> 00:27:23.090\nthe blanks for.\n\n592\n00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:24.146\n&gt;&gt; Well so it's important-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n593\n00:27:24.146 --> 00:27:24.839\n&gt;&gt; To think about that, right?\n\n594\n00:27:24.839 --> 00:27:26.552\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So all right, so\n\n595\n00:27:26.552 --> 00:27:28.202\nthe filler in the blanks.\n\n596\n00:27:28.202 --> 00:27:30.208\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's gonna be my new title.\n\n597\n00:27:30.208 --> 00:27:34.548\n&gt;&gt; Well for those of you guys who don't\nread cryptography books to put yourself to\n\n598\n00:27:34.548 --> 00:27:37.787\nsleep at night,\nthis is pretty much all new and exciting.\n\n599\n00:27:37.787 --> 00:27:40.400\nAt least I would think,\nbecause for me it is.\n\n600\n00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:41.384\nBut maybe not-\n&gt;&gt; And most people don't need\n\n601\n00:27:41.384 --> 00:27:42.543\ncryptography book to put\nthemselves to sleep at night.\n\n602\n00:27:42.543 --> 00:27:43.647\n&gt;&gt; Everyone shares that passion.\n\n603\n00:27:43.647 --> 00:27:45.861\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's probably a new process for\n\n604\n00:27:45.861 --> 00:27:47.230\nalmost everybody out there.\n\n605\n00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:49.299\nLike we said, Cherokee does need a friend.\n\n606\n00:27:49.299 --> 00:27:51.512\nPreferably one who understands Xored,\nright?\n\n607\n00:27:51.512 --> 00:27:54.243\nSo if you're interested in applying,\nlet us know.\n\n608\n00:27:54.243 --> 00:27:57.390\nSo as I said,\nan example will be essentially right.\n\n609\n00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:00.900\nWe do this, take the output,\nthe resultant of the round function on L0.\n\n610\n00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:04.972\nMove it over to the right and Xored it,\nand the same for the output on the right,\n\n611\n00:28:04.972 --> 00:28:06.900\nmove it over to the left and Xored it.\n\n612\n00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:09.102\nSo we're doing one of these, right?\n\n613\n00:28:09.102 --> 00:28:12.896\nWe're crossing as we go, and you're\ngonna do this a given number of times.\n\n614\n00:28:12.896 --> 00:28:16.884\nThis is the number of rounds,\n12 rounds, 16 rounds, 8 rounds,\n\n615\n00:28:16.884 --> 00:28:19.120\nwhatever that magic number is.\n\n616\n00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.593\nThe main difference\nbetween the algorithms and\n\n617\n00:28:21.593 --> 00:28:25.375\nthe implementation is essentially\nthe number of rounds or iterations.\n\n618\n00:28:25.375 --> 00:28:28.957\nThe round function, how many times we\nengage in the number of rounds is really\n\n619\n00:28:28.957 --> 00:28:32.670\nthe key to finding characteristic of\nhow we implement these algorithms.\n\n620\n00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:34.161\nSo this is at the heart,\n\n621\n00:28:34.161 --> 00:28:38.200\nthis general high level thought\nprocess of the Feistel cipher.\n\n622\n00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:42.540\nIt's at the heart of most modern\nalgorithms we use in this category.\n\n623\n00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:47.902\nYou mentioned DES and\nDES certainly does triple D.\n\n624\n00:28:47.902 --> 00:28:53.400\nDES certainly does use this function and\nis broken out this way.\n\n625\n00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.582\nBut there are others that use\nFeistel functions as well.\n\n626\n00:28:55.582 --> 00:28:58.444\nIt's very common for Feistel\nciphers to see this at the heart of\n\n627\n00:28:58.444 --> 00:29:00.610\nmany of the algorithms\nthat we talk about here.\n\n628\n00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:05.413\nSo hopefully the idea of just\nbreaking down, helping you to better\n\n629\n00:29:05.413 --> 00:29:09.897\nunderstand the thought process\nbehind this very important.\n\n630\n00:29:09.897 --> 00:29:14.259\nBut often not really talked about and\nnot well understood subprocess that\n\n631\n00:29:14.259 --> 00:29:17.270\nis underlying a lot of\nthese other algorithms.\n\n632\n00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:18.823\nBy calling it out and explaining it,\n\n633\n00:29:18.823 --> 00:29:21.141\nhopefully it's helped to\nclarify a little bit for us.\n\n634\n00:29:21.141 --> 00:29:23.269\nSo that as we go into\nsome future episodes, and\n\n635\n00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:25.700\nwe drill into some of\nthese other algorithms.\n\n636\n00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:29.189\nWe have a better understanding of the\ndescriptions on things that are going on\n\n637\n00:29:29.189 --> 00:29:31.025\nwhen we talk about deaths for instance.\n\n638\n00:29:31.025 --> 00:29:38.206\nDropping its data into 64-bit buckets cuz\nwe break into 64-bit baskets, excuse me.\n\n639\n00:29:38.206 --> 00:29:39.971\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; 64-bit baskets, and\n\n640\n00:29:39.971 --> 00:29:43.010\nthe desk block size is 64-bits, right?\n\n641\n00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:44.457\nSo we're gonna break that up and\n\n642\n00:29:44.457 --> 00:29:46.986\nwe manipulate through 16 different rounds,\nright?\n\n643\n00:29:46.986 --> 00:29:49.282\nWe go through 16 separate\nsteps of encryption, and\n\n644\n00:29:49.282 --> 00:29:51.630\nthat's gonna be the rounds\nthat we go through.\n\n645\n00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:55.542\nA substitution, bit shifting,\nlogical operations are all used to\n\n646\n00:29:55.542 --> 00:29:58.573\nessentially go from\na 64-bit to a 56-bit key.\n\n647\n00:29:58.573 --> 00:30:03.160\nBecause we use a 64-bit true key or\nrather a full key.\n\n648\n00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:06.350\nBut in actual implementation of 56-bits\nand we'll talk about the reason why.\n\n649\n00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:09.889\nAnd how we lose those eight bits where\nthey go and actually what we use them for\n\n650\n00:30:09.889 --> 00:30:11.450\nin an upcoming episode.\n\n651\n00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:12.969\nGive you a little hook\nto draw you back in.\n\n652\n00:30:12.969 --> 00:30:13.677\n&gt;&gt; I know, I'm so excited.\n\n653\n00:30:13.677 --> 00:30:17.327\n&gt;&gt; Wanna talk about that, but\nwe go through and we do the scrambling and\n\n654\n00:30:17.327 --> 00:30:18.490\nthe swapping.\n\n655\n00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:20.497\nAnd we finally transpose\nthrough all those rounds, and\n\n656\n00:30:20.497 --> 00:30:22.130\nthat's how we pop out the back side,\nright?\n\n657\n00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:24.758\nSo we use those thought processes,\nbut we use,\n\n658\n00:30:24.758 --> 00:30:28.000\ndo you know what they're\ncalled by the way, for DES?\n\n659\n00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.907\nNow you understand the concept for\nthe Feistel cipher-\n\n660\n00:30:30.907 --> 00:30:31.654\n&gt;&gt; What?\n\n661\n00:30:31.654 --> 00:30:35.462\n&gt;&gt; But do you know we actually use what we\nname those special boxes that we call, or\n\n662\n00:30:35.462 --> 00:30:36.223\nthat we break?\n\n663\n00:30:36.223 --> 00:30:36.860\n&gt;&gt; S boxes.\n\n664\n00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:37.755\n&gt;&gt; Call them S boxes, correct.\n\n665\n00:30:37.755 --> 00:30:38.485\nYou know what s stands for?\n\n666\n00:30:38.485 --> 00:30:42.523\n&gt;&gt; Somewhere in my brain,\nbut not right now.\n\n667\n00:30:42.523 --> 00:30:43.392\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you had to guess and\n\n668\n00:30:43.392 --> 00:30:45.515\nwe're talking about cryptography-\n&gt;&gt; Substitution.\n\n669\n00:30:45.515 --> 00:30:46.140\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n670\n00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:46.794\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n671\n00:30:46.794 --> 00:30:48.065\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\n\n672\n00:30:48.065 --> 00:30:50.961\nwe're gonna use what are called\nthe S boxes, substitution boxes.\n\n673\n00:30:50.961 --> 00:30:52.516\nAnd we'll talk about how they work, and\n\n674\n00:30:52.516 --> 00:30:55.512\nessentially the fact that they basically\nare just a glorified lookup table.\n\n675\n00:30:55.512 --> 00:30:58.100\nAnd so we'll have that conversation\nwhen we come back as well.\n\n676\n00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:59.375\n&gt;&gt; Great, well I'm excited.\n\n677\n00:30:59.375 --> 00:31:03.050\nI'm ready to explore the rest of the\nFeistel network, did I say that correct?\n\n678\n00:31:03.050 --> 00:31:05.603\n&gt;&gt; Essentially, we're done talking\nabout Feistel, we may refer to it, but\n\n679\n00:31:05.603 --> 00:31:07.272\nwe're gonna use that now just to-\n&gt;&gt; That family?\n\n680\n00:31:07.272 --> 00:31:08.446\n&gt;&gt; Build on and we're gonna talk about-\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n681\n00:31:08.446 --> 00:31:11.970\n&gt;&gt; All the other algorithms in the block\narea, through all the block ciphers.\n\n682\n00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:16.357\nWe'll go through Idea and\nwe'll go through Serpent and\n\n683\n00:31:16.357 --> 00:31:19.073\nTwofish Blowfish, all of those.\n\n684\n00:31:19.073 --> 00:31:19.603\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n685\n00:31:19.603 --> 00:31:21.840\nthen we'll also talk about\nstream ciphers as well.\n\n686\n00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.860\n&gt;&gt; All right, well you heard the man,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n687\n00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:27.200\nStay tuned, we have more block\nciphers headed your way.\n\n688\n00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.180\nBut for this show we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off.\n\n689\n00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:30.698\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n690\n00:31:30.698 --> 00:31:31.385\n&gt;&gt; I am Adam Gordon.\n\n691\n00:31:31.385 --> 00:31:33.182\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPro.TV.\n\n692\n00:31:33.182 -->

00:00:12.434\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.434 --> 00:00:14.720\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your ECES series.\n\n5\n00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.080\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.280\nThis is actually the episode where we're\ncontinuing to look at our symmetric\n\n7\n00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.310\ncryptography and hashing functions.\n\n8\n00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.990\nBut specifically we'll be looking at\nblock algorithms within this episode.\n\n9\n00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.228\nWith us today we have Mr.\nAdam Gordon in studio.\n\n10\n00:00:30.228 --> 00:00:33.012\nThank you for joining us today, Adam\n&gt;&gt; Howdy.\n\n11\n00:00:33.012 --> 00:00:36.478\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A man of few words.\n\n12\n00:00:36.478 --> 00:00:40.289\nAll right, so, I'm glad to be here, as\nalways and glad to have the opportunity to\n\n13\n00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:44.130\ntalk with you and to continue talking\nwith Cherokee about symmetric encryption.\n\n14\n00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.197\nWe are, as she rightly pointed out, about\nto continue and delve deeper into our\n\n15\n00:00:48.197 --> 00:00:52.270\nconversations around block algorithms and\nblock cyphers how they work.\n\n16\n00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.270\nWe had left off in our last\nepisode if you haven't seen it I\n\n17\n00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.740\nencourage you to go back and take a look.\n\n18\n00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.687\nWe delved into and went a little\ndeeper into the Feistel network,\n\n19\n00:00:59.687 --> 00:01:01.302\nthe Feistel cipher how that works.\n\n20\n00:01:01.302 --> 00:01:05.460\nBroke that down, set the foundation and\nthe building blocks for\n\n21\n00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.618\nsome of the new conversations\nwe're gonna have now around DES,\n\n22\n00:01:09.618 --> 00:01:14.630\nTriple DES, X-DES, DES-X,\nif you'd prefer to call it either one.\n\n23\n00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.180\nMost people will call it DES-X [LAUGH] and\nalso whitening.\n\n24\n00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.080\nAnd we're gonna talk about just those\nthings and how they relate to DES.\n\n25\n00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.459\nBut a lot of people don't know about\nthe thing that you pointed out in our last\n\n26\n00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:29.977\nconversation, our last episode,\nwith regards to DES, which is, as I said,\n\n27\n00:01:29.977 --> 00:01:34.973\nthat we use, and are interacting with, the\nthought processes from the Feistel cipher\n\n28\n00:01:34.973 --> 00:01:37.186\nto actually drive what we do with DES.\n\n29\n00:01:37.186 --> 00:01:39.916\nAnd to do the lookups,\nas we talked about with the S-boxes.\n\n30\n00:01:39.916 --> 00:01:45.420\nSo if we could just give\nme half a second here.\n\n31\n00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.090\nIf we could just put up on the screen for\na moment, just the notes I have.\n\n32\n00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.636\nI just wanna be able to show everybody\nhere what we're gonna talk about when we\n\n33\n00:01:51.636 --> 00:01:54.761\nbreak this down, just sort of\nthe basic building blocks and facts.\n\n34\n00:01:54.761 --> 00:01:56.443\nIt is a 64-bit algorithm but\n\n35\n00:01:56.443 --> 00:02:00.990\nit operates at 56-bits because we take\nout an 8-bit parity block that is used.\n\n36\n00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.298\nSo we talk about this being a 56-bit\nalgorithm when we implement it.\n\n37\n00:02:06.298 --> 00:02:08.940\nAnd those 8-bits for\nparity are used exactly for that,\n\n38\n00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.660\nfor parity to keep us\nhonest to make sure we have\n\n39\n00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.960\nthe ability to be able to track our data,\nrecover it, things of that nature.\n\n40\n00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.657\nAnd so when we implement DES,\nwe implement it as a 56-bit algorithm,\n\n41\n00:02:19.657 --> 00:02:22.588\nwhich means the DES is a 56-bit solution.\n\n42\n00:02:22.588 --> 00:02:24.601\nAlthough you don't often hear about it,\n\n43\n00:02:24.601 --> 00:02:27.995\nyou won't really find any commercial\nimplementations of what we call\n\n44\n00:02:27.995 --> 00:02:31.170\nDouble DES or the number two\nin front of DES, double DES.\n\n45\n00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.700\nDouble DES really didn't take off,\nbut it was essentially DES times 2,\n\n46\n00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.360\nand so you would have a 112-bit solution,\n56-bits times 2.\n\n47\n00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.043\nTriple DES became the standard that\nmost people are familiar with.\n\n48\n00:02:43.043 --> 00:02:44.145\nIt's the very, very bottom of the screen.\n\n49\n00:02:44.145 --> 00:02:46.951\nWe'll talk about that in a minute,\nbut that's DES times 3.\n\n50\n00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:52.490\nSo that is 56-bits times 3, or\n168-bit solution when we implement it.\n\n51\n00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.537\nSo we do wanna know that,\ncuz we take those 8-bit for\n\n52\n00:02:55.537 --> 00:02:57.990\nparity out of every round as we implement.\n\n53\n00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.419\nAlso we do Double DES for\n\n54\n00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:04.283\ntaking away a total of 16-bits from\nthe overall 64-bit solution times 2.\n\n55\n00:03:04.283 --> 00:03:06.869\nSo a bit of math there\ncounting fingers into toes.\n\n56\n00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:10.410\nBut the way DES works all through is\nyou can see summarized at a high level\n\n57\n00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.120\nthe four key areas or points that we would\ntraditionally think about and go through.\n\n58\n00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.500\nData is divided into 64-bit blocks.\n\n59\n00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.308\nBut remember, we pair that back to\nan actually, ultimately a 56-bit key,\n\n60\n00:03:20.308 --> 00:03:21.473\nbecause of the parity.\n\n61\n00:03:21.473 --> 00:03:25.478\nAnd so, we manipulate that through\n16 separate steps to encrypt through\n\n62\n00:03:25.478 --> 00:03:29.053\nsubstitution bit shifting, and\nget that down to a 56-bit key.\n\n63\n00:03:29.053 --> 00:03:30.500\nWe talked about that.\n\n64\n00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.618\nData's then further scrambled, the egg\nanalogy, using a swapping algorithm, so\n\n65\n00:03:34.618 --> 00:03:38.678\nwe talked about swapping, talked about\nthe ability of swapping and transposing.\n\n66\n00:03:38.678 --> 00:03:40.570\nSo remember swapping is the x oring,\nright.\n\n67\n00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.410\nSo that's where we bring in our x oring,\nso\n\n68\n00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.830\nthat's how we're seeing this\nwhole thing come together.\n\n69\n00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.030\nAnd then we transpose one last time,\n\n70\n00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.740\nthat's where we are going to move\nthose bits around even more.\n\n71\n00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.240\nAnd then ultimately we talked about\nthe fact that DES, let's scroll down so\n\n72\n00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.320\nyou can see this.\n\n73\n00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.815\nDES is gonna be using, we talked about\nthis at the very end of the last episode,\n\n74\n00:04:00.815 --> 00:04:04.750\nS-boxes, as you wildly identify\nas a substitution box, right?\n\n75\n00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.190\nAnd we use eight substitution boxes.\n\n76\n00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.240\nAnd I call them lookup table,\ncuz that's really what they are.\n\n77\n00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.660\nThe substitution box is a matrix\nthat we use and we're gonna\n\n78\n00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.450\nput some data into it on one side and\nlook up against it on the other side.\n\n79\n00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.762\nSo we drop in some bits,\nwe look them up against what's there, and\n\n80\n00:04:20.762 --> 00:04:24.975\nthen we generate some sort of output, we\ncall that the result or resultant, right?\n\n81\n00:04:24.975 --> 00:04:29.010\nAs we talked about, and so\neach S-boxes you can see has a table.\n\n82\n00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.680\nThat's where the lookup table concept\ncomes from determines based on the bits we\n\n83\n00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.720\nput into it.\n\n84\n00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.670\nPassing bits in is the idea\nof putting in the information\n\n85\n00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.290\nthat we will do the lookup against.\n\n86\n00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.764\nWe do a substitution for\nthose bits based on the lookup table.\n\n87\n00:04:41.764 --> 00:04:45.258\nEach item passed into the box gets\nsubstituted out with the item that matches\n\n88\n00:04:45.258 --> 00:04:46.780\nit in the lookup table.\n\n89\n00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.680\nEach one of these boxes takes in 6-bits,\nand produces 4-bits on the outside.\n\n90\n00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.879\nAnd the middle 4-bits of the 6-bits\ninput are used to do the lookup and\n\n91\n00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:56.460\ndo the 4-bit replacement.\n\n92\n00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.475\nSo essentially we're dropping,\nright, when we take in 6-bits and\n\n93\n00:04:59.475 --> 00:05:02.759\nwe're producing 4-bits out,\nwe're doing the comparison on middle 4.\n\n94\n00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:04.669\nAnd we're gonna output those 4-bits, and\n\n95\n00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:06.989\nthen we're gonna walk through\nthat a series of times.\n\n96\n00:05:06.989 --> 00:05:11.183\nSo eight S-boxes are used to do\nthe substitutions as we go through over\n\n97\n00:05:11.183 --> 00:05:13.300\nmultiple rounds.\n\n98\n00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.640\nAnd that's how DES actually works.\n\n99\n00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.526\nNow, DES itself was implemented,\ncame about in the late 1970s and\n\n100\n00:05:19.526 --> 00:05:23.935\nit's been around for a long,\nlong time, but is no longer used.\n\n101\n00:05:23.935 --> 00:05:25.601\nNeither is Triple DES or Double DES.\n\n102\n00:05:25.601 --> 00:05:29.110\nAlthough, as I said, Double DES never\nreally implemented formally anyway.\n\n103\n00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.430\nFor the most part,\npeople went from DES to really Triple DES.\n\n104\n00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.670\nBecause what made Triple DES famous was\nthe idea that, or infamous depending on\n\n105\n00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.086\nyour point of reference I suppose,\nwas the idea that the federal\n\n106\n00:05:40.086 --> 00:05:43.904\ngovernment decided to use Triple DES\nto standardize on its algorithm.\n\n107\n00:05:43.904 --> 00:05:48.527\nInitially in the 70s, 80s and into the\nearly 90s before it was ruled no longer\n\n108\n00:05:48.527 --> 00:05:52.491\nsafe to use because of concerns and\nwe replaced it ultimately with AES,\n\n109\n00:05:52.491 --> 00:05:56.939\nthe advanced encryption standard,\nwhich we'll also talk about here in a bit.\n\n110\n00:05:56.939 --> 00:06:00.727\nBut the federal government in the US\nsettled on the use of Triple DES as\n\n111\n00:06:00.727 --> 00:06:04.843\nits algorithm of choice for secret\ncommunications and actually used it for\n\n112\n00:06:04.843 --> 00:06:05.970\nmany, many years.\n\n113\n00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.201\nAnd that's how DES or Triple DES became\nfamous and you people know about it.\n\n114\n00:06:10.201 --> 00:06:14.323\n&gt;&gt; So it that why you chose to look at DES\nfirst because that was really the first\n\n115\n00:06:14.323 --> 00:06:18.447\ntime that we saw an algorithm being\nformally represented when they created\n\n116\n00:06:18.447 --> 00:06:21.981\nwhat was it the federal register\nbasically asking the public for\n\n117\n00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:24.430\nhelp to collaborate on a secure algorithm?\n\n118\n00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.541\n&gt;&gt; Well, one of the reasons, probably-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n119\n00:06:27.541 --> 00:06:28.598\n&gt;&gt; I guess if we go back and\n\n120\n00:06:28.598 --> 00:06:32.500\nthink about it, maybe not what I really\nhad in my mind, to be honest with you.\n\n121\n00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.922\nJust really thinking about the logic of\nwalking through, how we break DES down\n\n122\n00:06:36.922 --> 00:06:40.820\nbecause DES is the foundation for\nTriple DES, how we do a Triple DES.\n\n123\n00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.980\nAnd we'll take a look at this in just a\nsecond, is essentially use three DES keys.\n\n124\n00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.280\nWe label them K1, K2, K3.\n\n125\n00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.873\nAnd we go through each one being 56-bits,\nas I said, so a total of 168-bits.\n\n126\n00:06:51.873 --> 00:06:55.422\nAnd we just go through and encrypt\nwith key one, decrypt with key two,\n\n127\n00:06:55.422 --> 00:06:58.673\nre-encrypt with key three and\nwe have keying options where each\n\n128\n00:06:58.673 --> 00:07:02.310\nkey can be different or all three can\nbe the same depending on what we do.\n\n129\n00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.310\nAnd so if we use the same key,\nwe're encrypting,\n\n130\n00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.225\ndecrypting and re-encrypting the same\nkey which is kind of pointless.\n\n131\n00:07:07.225 --> 00:07:09.422\nNobody implements that way but\nif you scramble them and\n\n132\n00:07:09.422 --> 00:07:12.957\nuse random keys that are different, you're\nencrypting and decrypting with different\n\n133\n00:07:12.957 --> 00:07:16.340\nkeys to further obfuscate and make it\nmore difficult for people to guess.\n\n134\n00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.100\nBut we just lay out DES first so\nthat we have the building blocks and\n\n135\n00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.750\nthe basic understanding of how\nwe then jump to Triple DES.\n\n136\n00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:26.279\nCuz the commercial implementations of\nDES that people are familiar with,\n\n137\n00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:28.799\nthat people really know about\nwhen they think of DES,\n\n138\n00:07:28.799 --> 00:07:32.229\nthey're really thinking about\nTriple DES more often than not, right.\n\n139\n00:07:32.229 --> 00:07:34.820\nBecause that's what most\npeople are familiar with.\n\n140\n00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:35.835\nThat's just why we talk about it that way.\n\n141\n00:07:35.835 --> 00:07:38.411\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; At least why I talked about it that\n\n142\n00:07:38.411 --> 00:07:39.430\nway, anyway.\n\n143\n00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:40.530\nSo there you go.\n\n144\n00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:43.764\nRight, so a little bit of history, a\nlittle bit of fun, little bit of facts and\n\n145\n00:07:43.764 --> 00:07:46.071\na whole lot of what's the big deal,\nwho cares, right.\n\n146\n00:07:46.071 --> 00:07:47.327\nBut we do need to talk about this stuff.\n\n147\n00:07:47.327 --> 00:07:51.658\nIt is important, as we have spoken about\nbefore, because if we don't understand,\n\n148\n00:07:51.658 --> 00:07:55.501\nand let's be clear about this, DES\nare commercially one of the most widely\n\n149\n00:07:55.501 --> 00:07:58.857\ndeployed and used algorithms in\nthe world for many, many years.\n\n150\n00:07:58.857 --> 00:08:03.040\nYou still see most software has desk or\ntriple desk as an option for\n\n151\n00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.190\n[INAUDIBLE] you may not choose to use it.\n\n152\n00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:07.710\nIt is no longer recommended for\n\n153\n00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:11.990\nuse in secure implementations\nwhere you have to stand up to,\n\n154\n00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.700\nthe kind of attacks that may be propagated\nagainst top secret information.\n\n155\n00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:19.280\nBut for normal transmission of,\njust average data.\n\n156\n00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.963\nWe're sending and receiving some data,\nmaybe through a VPN.\n\n157\n00:08:21.963 --> 00:08:24.020\nOr we're sending and receiving.\n\n158\n00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.138\nOver email, whatever the case may be.\n\n159\n00:08:25.138 --> 00:08:30.310\nAnd we're just looking to provide base\nlevel confidentiality protections.\n\n160\n00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:33.220\nStill in theory, perfectly acceptable and\nit's still widely deployed.\n\n161\n00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.080\nSo it is one of the most common\nAlgorithms that's been out there for\n\n162\n00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:36.860\na long, long time.\n\n163\n00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:40.920\nRSA is probably equally common,\nequally widely deployed,\n\n164\n00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.760\nmore stronger protection there.\n\n165\n00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.170\nCertainly AES, very common today.\n\n166\n00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:48.408\nThe one that is essentially gonna take\nover for DES starting in the late 1990s,\n\n167\n00:08:48.408 --> 00:08:49.249\ninto the 2000s.\n\n168\n00:08:49.249 --> 00:08:50.860\nBut all of these Algorithms,\n\n169\n00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:54.390\nwe still see evidence of them\nbeing used all over the place.\n\n170\n00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:57.920\nTriple DES, as I mentioned,\nis referred to as a key bundle Algorithm.\n\n171\n00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.590\nThree keys, k1 through three, and\nwe use those keys to encrypt, decrypt, and\n\n172\n00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:02.100\nreencrypt.\n\n173\n00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.970\nAnd that's the secret of triple DES.\n\n174\n00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:07.830\nThree processes giving us the 168 bit\n\n175\n00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:10.850\nkey solution that we talked about and\nreferred to.\n\n176\n00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.500\nWe also have something known as Desk X.\n\n177\n00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.620\nAnd often discussed but\npeople don't intend to know much about it.\n\n178\n00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:20.300\nI talked people about Desk and I mentioned\nDesk X and they don't really know or\n\n179\n00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:21.020\nhave heard of that.\n\n180\n00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.210\nOther than a few who have heard of it or\n\n181\n00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:23.820\nknew about it before we\nstarted to talk about it.\n\n182\n00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.300\n&gt;&gt; No.\nI'm kind of interested because I kind\n\n183\n00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:26.797\nof feel like.\n\n184\n00:09:26.797 --> 00:09:29.090\nWas a band-aid, because it didn't want to.\n\n185\n00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:32.440\nMaybe companies had already put in their\nmoney, their effort into their hardware,\n\n186\n00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.780\ntheir software when was created.\n\n187\n00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:38.760\nAnd then whenever the committee\nlooked at that, I forget,\n\n188\n00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.430\nis it every five years or so?\n\n189\n00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:43.170\nAnd they wanted to\ndeprecate that Algorithm.\n\n190\n00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:46.950\nThey said, okay,\nlook instead we'll give triple DES.\n\n191\n00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:50.030\nSo, where does DES-X fit\ninto that situation?\n\n192\n00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:55.510\n&gt;&gt; So, where DES-X comes in,\nit comes after DES and,\n\n193\n00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:58.370\ncertainly, after triple\nDES was implemented.\n\n194\n00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:02.250\nIt's just an additional thought process\nthat further creates confusion.\n\n195\n00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:05.300\nMakes it harder for\npeople to figure out they key.\n\n196\n00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.210\nResults in a process\ncome which is whitening.\n\n197\n00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:11.270\nAnd most people probably,\nif they know anything about it,\n\n198\n00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:14.130\nmay know it as the name whitening,\nor the concept of whitening.\n\n199\n00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:18.040\nBut they don't often equate DES-X and\nwhitening together, when in effect, DES-X\n\n200\n00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:21.560\nis what we refer to as the formal name for\nthe process that leads to whitening.\n\n201\n00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.320\nSo it's essentially the same thing.\n\n202\n00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:27.820\nJust from a trivia perspective but\nlet's talk about what it is.\n\n203\n00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.650\nSo, what is desk x actually?\n\n204\n00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:31.990\nIt's a variation on desk we x or\n\n205\n00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:37.045\nanother 64 bit key into the plain text\nbefore we actually apply the Algorithm.\n\n206\n00:10:37.045 --> 00:10:41.175\nSo if we think about the concept of\nthe IV, the initialization vector and\n\n207\n00:10:41.175 --> 00:10:45.835\nthe randomness that we often will append\nto data in the beginning of a process\n\n208\n00:10:45.835 --> 00:10:48.800\nto further confuse and\nobfuscate what we're doing.\n\n209\n00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.235\nDES-X is just that.\n\n210\n00:10:51.235 --> 00:10:54.585\nBut it's specifically the process\nname that we give to this.\n\n211\n00:10:54.585 --> 00:11:00.520\nWhen we do this in DES, we use a 64-bit\nkey we appended to the data into Chile.\n\n212\n00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:01.660\nSo we XOR it.\n\n213\n00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:02.880\nWe do the comparison.\n\n214\n00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.440\nWe take the results in,\nand then we use that.\n\n215\n00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.360\nAnd by simply XOR-ing the additional key,\n\n216\n00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.905\nwhich is what we call\nwidening their process.\n\n217\n00:11:10.905 --> 00:11:14.955\nWe're adding confusion because\nif you don't know that first key\n\n218\n00:11:14.955 --> 00:11:17.145\nplus all the other stuff we do,\nthere's no way for\n\n219\n00:11:17.145 --> 00:11:20.415\nyou to unwind the encryption totally and\nderive the plain text.\n\n220\n00:11:20.415 --> 00:11:24.555\nUnless you are lucky through group\nforcing and guess not just one key, but\n\n221\n00:11:24.555 --> 00:11:26.905\nyou have to guess potentially with DES,\n\n222\n00:11:26.905 --> 00:11:32.110\nwith triple DES with DES X applied you\nhave to guess a total of four keys\n\n223\n00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:37.000\nif the triple key bundle in DES in triple\nDES is actually all separate keys.\n\n224\n00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:37.620\n&gt;&gt; That's interesting.\n\n225\n00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.140\n&gt;&gt; You'd have to get a total of four keys.\n\n226\n00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:41.160\n&gt;&gt; I didn't know that that\nwas what is formally called.\n\n227\n00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.050\nI just called it rinse, wash and repeat.\n\n228\n00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.710\n&gt;&gt; For triple DES?\n\n229\n00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:47.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n230\n00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.760\n&gt;&gt; Rinse, wash and repeat.\n\n231\n00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.590\nAs opposed to the-\n&gt;&gt; No, no, the DES-X with the 64-bit,\n\n232\n00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:54.540\nand then running it through\nagain adding that extra key.\n\n233\n00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.520\n&gt;&gt; Well, we add the key on the front end,\nnot on the back end.\n\n234\n00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.170\nSo, we add it before we do anything else.\n\n235\n00:11:58.170 --> 00:11:59.792\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So the key is used to\n\n236\n00:11:59.792 --> 00:12:01.700\ninitially with DES-X, with whitening.\n\n237\n00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.270\nThen, that is then passed\nthrough Into triple devs,\n\n238\n00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:08.110\nwhich would then be 3 keys K1 K2 K3.\n\n239\n00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:11.730\nEncrypt, decrypt, and then re-encrypt.\n\n240\n00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:15.740\nSo, if that's why I asked were\nyou applying to rinse repeat and\n\n241\n00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:16.900\nwash whatever you say.\n\n242\n00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:20.410\nWhat were you applying that to,\nbecause it's not applied to the front end.\n\n243\n00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:24.480\nOn the whitening you would be applying\nthat thought process to the backend,\n\n244\n00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.400\nso let's append that.\n\n245\n00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.530\nLet's make that accurate.\n\n246\n00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:29.220\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Let's call DEZ X whitening\n\n247\n00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.810\nthe pre-soak, right.\n\n248\n00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:32.360\nSo, for stain removal.\n\n249\n00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:38.630\nThen, let's go through and do the wash and\nthen, the rinse and then, the dry.\n\n250\n00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:40.820\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Because if we do that, and\n\n251\n00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.021\nwe now call this the laundry analogy-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n252\n00:12:43.021 --> 00:12:45.160\n&gt;&gt; We've got the full laundry life cycle.\n\n253\n00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.390\nBy the way,\nthis is me thinking on my feet,\n\n254\n00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:49.770\ncoming up with something that\nmakes sense out of this.\n\n255\n00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:52.542\n&gt;&gt; I hope it makes sense to other people,\nyeah.\n\n256\n00:12:52.542 --> 00:12:54.289\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna do the whole laundry\n\n257\n00:12:54.289 --> 00:12:55.210\nanalogy today.\n\n258\n00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:55.940\nThat work, right?\n\n259\n00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:58.440\nAnd you can make that analogy\nthat's gonna work for you,\n\n260\n00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.275\nI have no clue where that came from.\n\n261\n00:13:00.275 --> 00:13:01.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, I like it.\n\n262\n00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:02.480\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n263\n00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.120\nAnd the output of these\nconversations is typically\n\n264\n00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.700\nI get new ways to think about\nthis stuff which is really great.\n\n265\n00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:09.450\nI like the whole egg thing we did.\n\n266\n00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:10.340\nI like this thing.\n\n267\n00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:13.900\nIt just took me a second to just put in\nperspective cause I had to understand what\n\n268\n00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:15.160\nyou were referring to.\n\n269\n00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.770\nBut if you get my logic on this, right.\n\n270\n00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.750\nSo the upfront, the widening.\n\n271\n00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:22.750\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Is actually idea of doing\n\n272\n00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:24.050\nthe 64 bit key.\n\n273\n00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:26.420\nAppend to the plain text data and\n\n274\n00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.390\nit before we ever touch it with triple\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n275\n00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:32.090\n&gt;&gt; Then,\nwe're gonna run that resultant through and\n\n276\n00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:35.320\nactually now take that and\nrun that through triple So\n\n277\n00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:39.620\nwe're gonna essentially do two separate\nfunctions and two separate operations.\n\n278\n00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:44.060\nAnd the triple operation bundled\ntogether is made up of three keys.\n\n279\n00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:48.420\nAnd those keys will encrypt, decrypt,\nand re-encrypt, and if we randomize and\n\n280\n00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:50.970\nchoose three different keys for\nevery one of those keys,\n\n281\n00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:55.390\nplus the fourth key, which is really\nthe 64-bit pre-key that we use, we've got\n\n282\n00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:58.155\na total of four keys we've got you had\nto guess in order to crack it totally.\n\n283\n00:13:58.155 --> 00:14:01.875\nSo, it makes Triple DES much stronger\nbecause we add yet another key to the mix.\n\n284\n00:14:01.875 --> 00:14:02.435\n&gt;&gt; More complexity.\n\n285\n00:14:02.435 --> 00:14:03.285\n&gt;&gt; More complexity.\n\n286\n00:14:03.285 --> 00:14:04.127\n&gt;&gt; Obfuscation.\nThere we go.\n\n287\n00:14:04.127 --> 00:14:05.552\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; More confusion, as we would say.\n\n288\n00:14:05.552 --> 00:14:06.096\nOr obfuscation.\n\n289\n00:14:06.096 --> 00:14:08.320\n&gt;&gt; Sorry.\n[LAUGH] Hopefully, not too much confusion.\n\n290\n00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.065\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, not too much.\n\n291\n00:14:10.065 --> 00:14:14.365\nBut the right amount if we are looking\nto augment or make Triple DES stronger,\n\n292\n00:14:14.365 --> 00:14:14.935\nas you were saying.\n\n293\n00:14:14.935 --> 00:14:17.235\nBecause we do those reviews,\nas you pointed out.\n\n294\n00:14:17.235 --> 00:14:22.640\nAnd yeah, we even with that we got to a\npoint where, with modern computing power,\n\n295\n00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.960\nwe found the triple DES\nwould be subjected to, and\n\n296\n00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:30.160\nsuccessfully subjected to brute force\nattacks, based on being able to guess\n\n297\n00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.400\nthe number of keys that would potentially\nbe available, and running through them.\n\n298\n00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.630\nJust based on the evergrowing\namount of computing power.\n\n299\n00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:37.470\n&gt;&gt; Processing power, yeah.\n\n300\n00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:40.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely,\nwhat we would refer to Moore's Law, and\n\n301\n00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:43.340\nusing Moore's Law, Gordon Moore,\none of the founders of Intel, right?\n\n302\n00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:46.190\nThe idea that ultimately, we, at the time,\n\n303\n00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:49.140\nroughly double computing power over so\nmany months.\n\n304\n00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:54.110\nWe're down to somewhere between 9 and\n12 months on average now and that number\n\n305\n00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:58.220\nchanges a little although we're plateauing\nand kid of bottoming out on how often we\n\n306\n00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.870\ncan double with our current silicone\nbased chip architecture, but-.\n\n307\n00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:02.629\n&gt;&gt; Which is a good thing.\n\n308\n00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:05.996\nWell, may or may not be a good thing.\n\n309\n00:15:05.996 --> 00:15:08.420\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot of conversations there\n\n310\n00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.950\nabout the fact that it may be\ngood because we can now more or\n\n311\n00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:15.650\nless baseline what our protection\nmay be from a security perspective.\n\n312\n00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:19.680\nIt's not a good thing if we\ncannot continue our ability to\n\n313\n00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.240\ncreate processing power on.\n\n314\n00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.220\nA platform, not necessarily this platform.\n\n315\n00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:26.790\nBut we talked, for\ninstance, in our first or\n\n316\n00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:30.420\nour second episode in this whole series\nabout the impact of quantum computing.\n\n317\n00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:33.510\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; And potentially what that may look like\n\n318\n00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:34.990\nwho knows how many years down the road.\n\n319\n00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:38.280\nVery soon, very much sooner,\nI think, than later.\n\n320\n00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.880\nIn our lifetimes, no doubt about it.\n\n321\n00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.830\nBut I'm talking soon,\nin the next three to five years, soon.\n\n322\n00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:44.990\nBecause quantum computing\nis already a reality.\n\n323\n00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:47.300\nIt exists, we are using quantum computers.\n\n324\n00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:50.537\nBut, they haven't been really\ncommercialized and are not existing\n\n325\n00:15:50.537 --> 00:15:54.459\noutside of large research institutions,\nlabs, and government entities today.\n\n326\n00:15:54.459 --> 00:15:57.162\nWhen we have quantum computers\nrunning the watch on your wrist,\n\n327\n00:15:57.162 --> 00:15:59.929\nthat's when we think it's really\ncommercialized and arrived.\n\n328\n00:15:59.929 --> 00:16:02.287\nThat's gonna take probably\nfive to ten years.\n\n329\n00:16:02.287 --> 00:16:06.578\nBut the ideas behind shifting that\narchitecture platform and being able to,\n\n330\n00:16:06.578 --> 00:16:11.133\nessentially, reinvent and change the\nentire dynamic, is gonna radically alter\n\n331\n00:16:11.133 --> 00:16:15.374\nwhat we think of in terms of computing\npower and the ability to go after this.\n\n332\n00:16:15.374 --> 00:16:18.893\nCuz then we need, as we talked about as\nwell, the ideas of quantum cryptography\n\n333\n00:16:18.893 --> 00:16:20.581\nbeing brought in to-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Yeah,\n\n334\n00:16:20.581 --> 00:16:22.314\nbecause we see that horizon approaching.\n\n335\n00:16:22.314 --> 00:16:25.031\n&gt;&gt; We do see it approaching, but\nwe have to change the fundamental\n\n336\n00:16:25.031 --> 00:16:27.900\nthought processes about how\nall these algorithms work.\n\n337\n00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:31.170\n&gt;&gt; Because all of this stuff we're\ntalking about, while it's obviously very\n\n338\n00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:35.160\nimportant and very timely,\nnow is based on a set of assumptions and\n\n339\n00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:39.330\narchitectures that won't hold true\nwhen we use quantum computers.\n\n340\n00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:43.055\nAnd you need new algorithms and\nnew cryptographic functions to be able to\n\n341\n00:16:43.055 --> 00:16:46.122\nexist in that new world,\nbe able to do things differently.\n\n342\n00:16:46.122 --> 00:16:48.982\nAnd quantum computing is gonna\nbe locked-stepped and joined\n\n343\n00:16:48.982 --> 00:16:52.781\nat the hip with quantum cryptography,\ncuz you can't have one without the other.\n\n344\n00:16:52.781 --> 00:16:56.129\n&gt;&gt; And the good news is Adam, you're\nprobably inspiring some young ladies and\n\n345\n00:16:56.129 --> 00:17:00.069\ngentleman, or old, whomever, right now to\ngo ahead and pioneer those new algorithms.\n\n346\n00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:03.074\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I could only aspire to something as\n\n347\n00:17:03.074 --> 00:17:03.788\ncool as that.\n\n348\n00:17:03.788 --> 00:17:05.814\nI don't know that that's happening, but\n\n349\n00:17:05.814 --> 00:17:09.480\nhopefully somebody somewhere's\nbeing inspired to do something.\n\n350\n00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.151\nAnd whoever you are,\nget moving and do it quickly,\n\n351\n00:17:12.151 --> 00:17:13.965\ncuz we need you to figure that out.\n\n352\n00:17:13.965 --> 00:17:15.309\nAll right, so let's continue talking.\n\n353\n00:17:15.309 --> 00:17:18.622\nWe talked about DES, we talked about\nTriple DES, we talked about DES X, slash,\n\n354\n00:17:18.622 --> 00:17:19.170\nwhitening.\n\n355\n00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:20.548\nCan refer to it either way.\n\n356\n00:17:20.548 --> 00:17:23.660\nWanna know these concepts,\nunderstand them, be comfortable with them.\n\n357\n00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:27.293\nIf you're planning on taking an exam some\npoint in the future, it would be good for\n\n358\n00:17:27.293 --> 00:17:28.094\nyou to know that.\n\n359\n00:17:28.094 --> 00:17:30.827\nIf you're planning on applying\nthis knowledge in the real world\n\n360\n00:17:30.827 --> 00:17:32.000\noutside of the classroom.\n\n361\n00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.310\nOutside of our time together here as we go\nthrough one or more episodes outside of\n\n362\n00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:40.290\na testing environment, then it will be\nhelpful for you to be able to understand,\n\n363\n00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:44.560\nto be able to explain these concepts\nto whoever you're dealing with.\n\n364\n00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.813\nIn the real world, I get asked\nthis all the time from customers.\n\n365\n00:17:46.813 --> 00:17:50.130\nI get this from students a lot but\nI get it from customers as well.\n\n366\n00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:51.750\nWhat would be your recommendation?\n\n367\n00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:52.965\nHow would you approach this?\n\n368\n00:17:52.965 --> 00:17:56.290\nWhat would you suggest we do\nto deal with this situation?\n\n369\n00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:59.936\nI get these opportunities to have these\nconversations on a regular basis.\n\n370\n00:17:59.936 --> 00:18:03.968\nAnd I look forward to them, cuz I love\ntalking about this with my customers,\n\n371\n00:18:03.968 --> 00:18:06.620\nwith students, with all of you,\nwith Cherokee.\n\n372\n00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:09.219\nWith anybody who's willing to sit and\nspend time, and\n\n373\n00:18:09.219 --> 00:18:11.888\nis interested generally,\nas she is, as all of you are.\n\n374\n00:18:11.888 --> 00:18:15.231\nIn this, you could see the genuine\nenthusiasm she has for\n\n375\n00:18:15.231 --> 00:18:16.770\nthis when we do our shows.\n\n376\n00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:18.242\nAnd when we talk about this stuff, and\n\n377\n00:18:18.242 --> 00:18:20.560\nyou could see how excited\nshe gets about this stuff.\n\n378\n00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.250\nBecause she's interested and\nshe studies it, she's learning about it.\n\n379\n00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:24.856\nShe knows a lot about it already and\n\n380\n00:18:24.856 --> 00:18:27.303\ncontinues to learn more as\nwe go through this stuff.\n\n381\n00:18:27.303 --> 00:18:29.739\nAnd she plays a mean game of checkers,\nby the way,\n\n382\n00:18:29.739 --> 00:18:31.770\nwhich has nothing to do with encryption.\n\n383\n00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:33.407\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [SOUND] Don't\ntell all my secrets.\n\n384\n00:18:33.407 --> 00:18:34.295\n&gt;&gt; She's a dead ringer for that.\n\n385\n00:18:34.295 --> 00:18:38.535\nSo if you ever get challenged to\na game of checkers, watch out for her.\n\n386\n00:18:38.535 --> 00:18:39.276\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n387\n00:18:39.276 --> 00:18:41.860\nAES, let's talk about\nadvanced encryption standard.\n\n388\n00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:43.357\nThis is what replaces DES.\n\n389\n00:18:43.357 --> 00:18:44.051\nWe were talking about this.\n\n390\n00:18:44.051 --> 00:18:47.643\nAs of 2001, formally, AES is nominated and\n\n391\n00:18:47.643 --> 00:18:52.750\nindeed does win the NSA Sponsor Contest\nfor a replacement for DES.\n\n392\n00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:53.620\nAnd as of 2001,\n\n393\n00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:57.260\nfederal government in the United States\nformally reaches into the hat and\n\n394\n00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:01.580\nout of the five finalists pulls out what\nwas then called the region doll algorithm.\n\n395\n00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:04.483\nRenamed AES when they decided to use it.\n\n396\n00:19:04.483 --> 00:19:09.427\nAnd as announced by NIST, in the United\nStates represented the federal government\n\n397\n00:19:09.427 --> 00:19:13.250\nas FIPS, federal information\nprocessing standard, 197.\n\n398\n00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:18.133\nSo when NIST formally renames the region\ndoll algorithm, taps it and says,\n\n399\n00:19:18.133 --> 00:19:21.413\nyou will formally replace DES,\nwe call it now AES,\n\n400\n00:19:21.413 --> 00:19:24.724\nthe advanced encryption\nstandard as of 2001.\n\n401\n00:19:24.724 --> 00:19:29.990\nAnd it was listed officially as FIPS 197,\nthat's how we actually refer to it.\n\n402\n00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:33.441\nAt least if you talk about it formally,\nthat's where you will find it.\n\n403\n00:19:33.441 --> 00:19:36.356\nI know you love going out to Google, so\nI'm gonna ask you to do a favor for me.\n\n404\n00:19:36.356 --> 00:19:37.385\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; While I'm on talking cuz I did not do\n\n405\n00:19:37.385 --> 00:19:38.305\nthis ahead of time and I should've.\n\n406\n00:19:38.305 --> 00:19:39.301\nI apologize.\n\n407\n00:19:39.301 --> 00:19:40.539\nWe're gonna fix it right now for you.\n\n408\n00:19:40.539 --> 00:19:45.115\nIf you don't mind going out, just\nlooking up NIST FIPS 197 real quick and\n\n409\n00:19:45.115 --> 00:19:49.640\nthat way we can throw up just a quick\ncitation and show everybody out there.\n\n410\n00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.381\n&gt;&gt; 1597?\n\n411\n00:19:50.381 --> 00:19:51.401\n&gt;&gt; No, 197.\n\n412\n00:19:51.401 --> 00:19:52.083\n&gt;&gt; 197.\n\n413\n00:19:52.083 --> 00:19:54.335\n&gt;&gt; It's F-I-P-S 197.\n\n414\n00:19:54.335 --> 00:19:57.280\nIt's probably FIPS-197 most likely.\n\n415\n00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.570\nBut you'll find the actual\nannouncement and standard for it.\n\n416\n00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:02.610\nCherokee'll work on that a second for\nus and\n\n417\n00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:05.560\nwe'll put that up just as soon as she\nhas that, she'll tell us she's ready.\n\n418\n00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.731\nBut AES can be implemented\nwith three key sizes.\n\n419\n00:20:08.731 --> 00:20:12.260\nSo we have 128-bit, 192-bit, 256-bit keys.\n\n420\n00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:17.225\nThe three different\nimplementations are referred to as\n\n421\n00:20:17.225 --> 00:20:21.560\nAES 128, AES 192, AES 256, and AES.\n\n422\n00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.120\nIt's great how I said that and\nit just appeared right there.\n\n423\n00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.380\nThat's awesome.\n\n424\n00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:26.180\nThank you, Megan, we appreciate that.\n\n425\n00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:29.908\nSo you can see the actual standard,\nthe announcement, if you will,\n\n426\n00:20:29.908 --> 00:20:33.768\nthat the Federal Information\nProcessing Standard Publication 197\n\n427\n00:20:33.768 --> 00:20:36.095\nwas used to announce\nthe advent of the AES.\n\n428\n00:20:36.095 --> 00:20:37.280\nAnd if you wanna go out and take a look,\n\n429\n00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.100\nwe're not gonna scroll\nthrough the whole thing.\n\n430\n00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:43.934\nBut you could see right there,\nthat is actually the formal document.\n\n431\n00:20:43.934 --> 00:20:45.001\nWill you capture the URL?\n\n432\n00:20:45.001 --> 00:20:46.843\nJust put that up so if people wanna go-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] I sure will.\n\n433\n00:20:46.843 --> 00:20:48.872\n&gt;&gt; Actually do that,\nthey can go look it up for themselves.\n\n434\n00:20:48.872 --> 00:20:50.287\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So we'll put that in the show notes for\n\n435\n00:20:50.287 --> 00:20:51.790\nyou just in case you're interested.\n\n436\n00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:53.990\nYou could always go Google it of\ncourse just like Cherokee did.\n\n437\n00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:56.268\nBut that way, you can actually read\nup on it if you're interested.\n\n438\n00:20:56.268 --> 00:20:57.668\nBy the way, just to be clear,\n\n439\n00:20:57.668 --> 00:21:00.696\ndon't need to read the standard in\norder [LAUGH] to take the exam.\n\n440\n00:21:00.696 --> 00:21:03.058\nDon't expect you to understand\neverything in there.\n\n441\n00:21:03.058 --> 00:21:03.711\nWe just want you to know\njust where it comes from.\n\n442\n00:21:03.711 --> 00:21:07.813\nBecause it's always important to be able\nto refer to the source documentation and\n\n443\n00:21:07.813 --> 00:21:11.686\nknow the actual history as well as\nthe implementation guidance behind this.\n\n444\n00:21:11.686 --> 00:21:13.721\nAnd you can see the various\nbit sizes there.\n\n445\n00:21:13.721 --> 00:21:18.640\nCryptographic keys are 128 192 and 256\nbits right there, so you can, whoa, hello.\n\n446\n00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:19.678\n&gt;&gt; Wow, you can really see them.\n\n447\n00:21:19.678 --> 00:21:20.408\n&gt;&gt; Okay, now we can see them.\n\n448\n00:21:20.408 --> 00:21:22.525\nWow, that was kinda scary.\n\n449\n00:21:22.525 --> 00:21:23.445\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, we could see it right there.\n\n450\n00:21:23.445 --> 00:21:24.966\n&gt;&gt; And my touchscreen is very sensitive.\n\n451\n00:21:24.966 --> 00:21:27.358\n&gt;&gt; This is why we don't let\nCherokee play with the touchscreen,\n\n452\n00:21:27.358 --> 00:21:29.300\nunless it's absolutely necessary.\n\n453\n00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:30.694\nLook, I can zoom in and out.\n\n454\n00:21:30.694 --> 00:21:31.570\nMom, look, wow, exciting.\n\n455\n00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:36.008\nAll right, so\nall three of the key standards, 128,\n\n456\n00:21:36.008 --> 00:21:39.700\n192, 128, 192, 256 bit keys.\n\n457\n00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:43.266\nThey all operate on a 128 bit block.\n\n458\n00:21:43.266 --> 00:21:46.505\nSo our basket size,\nnotice that basket size.\n\n459\n00:21:46.505 --> 00:21:47.421\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Thank you.\n\n460\n00:21:47.421 --> 00:21:52.780\n&gt;&gt; Our basket size for AES,\n128 bits per basket, just to be clear.\n\n461\n00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:54.772\nAnd by the way,\non the exam you will not see baskets.\n\n462\n00:21:54.772 --> 00:21:56.046\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's a Cherokee thing.\n\n463\n00:21:56.046 --> 00:21:57.900\nThat is not a real thing.\n\n464\n00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:01.400\nBut that's how she refers to it and\nit makes sense and I like the analogy.\n\n465\n00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:05.530\nIt works real well but basket is just\nanother way of us referring to the block\n\n466\n00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:07.240\nand just to be formal and clear.\n\n467\n00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:09.462\nWe talk about a 128 bit block size,\n\n468\n00:22:09.462 --> 00:22:12.944\nthat's the formal way that we\ndo refer to when we read up on.\n\n469\n00:22:12.944 --> 00:22:17.277\nWhen we study about, when we talk about\nformally how these algorithms work,\n\n470\n00:22:17.277 --> 00:22:19.740\nit's the block size that we refer to.\n\n471\n00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:23.110\nBut we can easily talk about it\nas a basket size as well, okay?\n\n472\n00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:29.800\nSo make sure we know 128 bits for that,\nwe use a substitution permutation.\n\n473\n00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.139\nAnd I have to say this slowly,\n\n474\n00:22:31.139 --> 00:22:34.958\nsubstitution permutation matrix rather\nthan a Feistel network or Feistel cipher.\n\n475\n00:22:34.958 --> 00:22:38.820\nSo unlike DES,\nwe aren't using a Feistel cipher here.\n\n476\n00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:41.504\nWe are using what's called\na substitution permutation matrix.\n\n477\n00:22:41.504 --> 00:22:46.706\nOne of the value adds and strengthening\nmechanisms that AES brought to the table\n\n478\n00:22:46.706 --> 00:22:51.597\nthat led primarily to its being chosen\nsuccessfully to be the successor for\n\n479\n00:22:51.597 --> 00:22:55.420\nDES was that it went away from\nthe original architecture.\n\n480\n00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:57.966\nAnd implemented changes that\nit made much more secure.\n\n481\n00:22:57.966 --> 00:22:59.820\nSo this is important to know.\n\n482\n00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:02.405\nWe operate on a different approach.\n\n483\n00:23:02.405 --> 00:23:05.940\nAnd you wanna make sure you're just\nfamiliar with the general idea about this.\n\n484\n00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:09.099\nBecause it is a different way\nof thinking about things.\n\n485\n00:23:09.099 --> 00:23:11.775\nAnd I'm gonna break down\nthe steps here for you.\n\n486\n00:23:11.775 --> 00:23:14.760\nWe're gonna take a look at them and\ntalk about them here.\n\n487\n00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:18.203\nJust a second, let me just fix my little\nshow note there, it had a little error.\n\n488\n00:23:18.203 --> 00:23:20.904\nAll right so let's just go and\nadd a tab out of place.\n\n489\n00:23:20.904 --> 00:23:21.803\nI'm just one of those people.\n\n490\n00:23:21.803 --> 00:23:24.134\nIt's gotta be lined up and\nit's all gotta be the way it was.\n\n491\n00:23:24.134 --> 00:23:26.300\nSo it was shifted out of the way there.\n\n492\n00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:28.460\nAll right, so I laid out\nthe general steps for you for AES.\n\n493\n00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:29.520\nJust wanna go through them.\n\n494\n00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:30.590\nMake sure, like we did with DES,\n\n495\n00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:33.050\nwe're comfortable with the high\nlevel thought process.\n\n496\n00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:34.030\nHow does it work?\n\n497\n00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:35.190\nWhat does it look like?\n\n498\n00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:38.870\nWe'll see here in step number 1,\nkey expansion.\n\n499\n00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:42.324\nSo round keys are derived from\nthe cipher key using the, remember,\n\n500\n00:23:42.324 --> 00:23:44.998\nthe original name of the AS\nalgorithm's Rijndael.\n\n501\n00:23:44.998 --> 00:23:48.095\nThat's how you pronounce R-I-J-N-D-A-E-L,\n\n502\n00:23:48.095 --> 00:23:50.860\nby the way,\nit's called Rijndael or Rijndael.\n\n503\n00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:52.700\nYou hear people use a slight variation.\n\n504\n00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:56.471\nBut either way, the Rijndael key schedule.\n\n505\n00:23:56.471 --> 00:23:58.351\nRemember, we talked\nabout the key schedule.\n\n506\n00:23:58.351 --> 00:24:02.775\nThat is the algorithm used To be able to\ngenerate the subkeys from the original\n\n507\n00:24:02.775 --> 00:24:06.550\nkey and the number of subkeys\nit will generate for the rounds.\n\n508\n00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:10.330\nSo key expansion is deriving\nusing the key schedule,\n\n509\n00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:14.700\nthe subkeys necessary to drive all the\nrounds, using an individual key per round\n\n510\n00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:18.570\nso that we further confuse and\nfurther obfuscate, as we talked about.\n\n511\n00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:22.830\nThe initial round, you'll see we do what's\ncalled add round key as a function.\n\n512\n00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:26.520\nEach byte of the state is combined with\nthe round key, using a bitwise XOR.\n\n513\n00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:28.040\nWell we know about XORing now.\n\n514\n00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.140\nSo we do that.\n\n515\n00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:35.960\nThen step 3, or item number 3 as we walk\ndown, is made up of 4 substeps, right?\n\n516\n00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.320\nSo you'll see the Rounds.\n\n517\n00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:41.390\nWe do SubBytes, ShiftRow,\nMixColumn and AddRoundKey.\n\n518\n00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:44.450\nSo we're going through four\ndistinct steps in the rounds.\n\n519\n00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:48.020\nAll four of these together equal\nthe processing that goes on in the round.\n\n520\n00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:51.990\nRemember we talked about the round\nfunction in the Feistel cipher, and\n\n521\n00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:55.270\nwe said that it varies by algorithm,\nvaries by implementation, and that it's\n\n522\n00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:59.320\na series of steps to where we would\nengage in that would be taking place.\n\n523\n00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:02.850\nIt wasn't as important to find what it\nwas specifically, unless you were talking\n\n524\n00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:05.910\nabout a very specific implementation for\na unique algorithm.\n\n525\n00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:08.860\nWe're just showing you what that\nimplementation looks like here\n\n526\n00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:10.270\nspecific to AES.\n\n527\n00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:13.200\nSo these steps,\nthe substeps one through four,\n\n528\n00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.610\nare what actually makes up what we would\ncall the round function, or the rounds,\n\n529\n00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:18.748\njust for generically as the rounds, right?\n\n530\n00:25:18.748 --> 00:25:22.660\nSo SubBytes, non-linear substitution\nstep where each byte is replaced\n\n531\n00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:24.520\nwith another recording tool lookup table.\n\n532\n00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:27.730\nWe call the lookup tables\nhere Rijndael S-boxes.\n\n533\n00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:30.190\nRemember, in DES we just\ncalled them S-boxes.\n\n534\n00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:33.280\nWe still call them S-boxes,\ncuz they are substitution boxes.\n\n535\n00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:36.040\nBut we simply tack on the name\nof the algorithm in the front.\n\n536\n00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.370\nAnd they call call them\nRijndael S-boxes to differentiate them\n\n537\n00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:42.420\nfrom other generic S-boxes\nassigned to other algorithms.\n\n538\n00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:45.080\nSo we just have a specificity tag there.\n\n539\n00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.576\nSo we do that with a look up table.\n\n540\n00:25:46.576 --> 00:25:51.360\nShift row, we\n\n541\n00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:56.880\ndo a transposition step, where each row of\nthe state is actually shifted cyclically.\n\n542\n00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:00.680\nCertain number of steps that we're\ncyclically doing transpositions and\n\n543\n00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:01.880\nshifting, right.\n\n544\n00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:05.780\nAnd then next column, a mixing operation\nwhere we are kind of scrambling,\n\n545\n00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:07.740\nit's kind of what you type\nabout the edges, right.\n\n546\n00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:09.950\nWe're operating on\nthe columns of the state,\n\n547\n00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:11.840\ncombining the four bytes in each column.\n\n548\n00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.220\nI didn't tell you that we actually,\n\n549\n00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:18.360\nin the transposition matrix that we use,\nwe actually refer to that as the state.\n\n550\n00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.480\nThat's actually what\nthe thought process is.\n\n551\n00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.000\nLet me just go back up\nhere in my notes for\n\n552\n00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.830\nyou real quick, you'll see that up here.\n\n553\n00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:27.386\nI just didn't use that name\nwhen I talked about it.\n\n554\n00:26:27.386 --> 00:26:31.070\nRemember, I said substitution-permutation\nmatrix is used and\n\n555\n00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:33.640\nwhat we call that is actually the state,\nso\n\n556\n00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:38.550\nthe substitution-permutation matrix being\nused, referred to as the state and that's\n\n557\n00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:44.130\nwhere we get that name from here in step,\nwhoops, let me go put that back there.\n\n558\n00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:46.740\nAnd that's what I get for\nrolling forward and backwards and\n\n559\n00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:48.620\nnot paying attention\nwhere I am on the screen.\n\n560\n00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:53.170\nThat's where we actually get in\nstep number three for the rounds,\n\n561\n00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:58.200\nin sub step number two where we talk about\neach row of the state being shifted.\n\n562\n00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.450\nThat's coming from\nthe substitution permutation\n\n563\n00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:02.810\nMatrix that we were talking about.\n\n564\n00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:04.720\nSo, that's where we get that, and\n\n565\n00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:08.230\nthe mixing columns as well,\nmixing operations we were talking about,\n\n566\n00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:11.770\nthat's where we are mixing the states\nto get those columns together.\n\n567\n00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:13.602\nAnd then we do an AddRoundKey.\n\n568\n00:27:13.602 --> 00:27:16.000\nWe're adding the round keys for\nfind out our steps there, and\n\n569\n00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.540\nremember the AddRoundKey comes\nfrom up here in the initial round.\n\n570\n00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:21.620\nRight AddRoundKey right here,\n\n571\n00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:24.770\neach byte of the state is combined\nwith the round key using bitwise XOR.\n\n572\n00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:27.630\nAgain, the state is that matrix\nthat we're referring to, right?\n\n573\n00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:31.900\nSo we're bringing this function in, and\ndoing all four of these in the rounds for\n\n574\n00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:34.800\nAES, and\nthen the final round when we're done,\n\n575\n00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:37.580\nright, many number of\nrounds we go through.\n\n576\n00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:39.530\nWhen we're done, we do a final round.\n\n577\n00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:42.950\nWe do subbyte, we do shiftrow,\nand do addroundkey.\n\n578\n00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:43.610\nIn other words,\n\n579\n00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:48.450\nwe do all of the things in the rounds with\none exception, we drop the mixed column.\n\n580\n00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:51.480\nWe don't do the mixed\ncolumn in the final round.\n\n581\n00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:54.510\nSo if we have a 16 round,\nround key function, or\n\n582\n00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:59.850\nexcuse me a 16 round function, we're gonna\ndo 15 rounds, one through four, right.\n\n583\n00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:03.030\nSubByte, ShiftRow, MixedColumn,\nAddRoundKey, every time.\n\n584\n00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:07.890\nSixteenth round, final round, is three\nof the four, no MixedColumn is used for\n\n585\n00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:08.580\nthe final round.\n\n586\n00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:11.950\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n&gt;&gt; And then when we're done, we are tired,\n\n587\n00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:13.851\nbecause we've been going around and\naround and around.\n\n588\n00:28:13.851 --> 00:28:14.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n589\n00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:16.150\n&gt;&gt; Gotta sit,\nwe're dizzy we gotta sit down.\n\n590\n00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:19.920\nBut when we're done, right,\nat the end we have our cypher text.\n\n591\n00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:24.770\nCuz remember, everything in the interim\nis gonna be translating and\n\n592\n00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:29.350\nmoving and iterating through\ninternally in the algorithm.\n\n593\n00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:34.050\nWe don't see that interim data, that\ninterim cipher text that's coming out of\n\n594\n00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:36.150\none and\nbeing fed into next rounding through.\n\n595\n00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:37.830\nWe only see it at the far side.\n\n596\n00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:42.180\nSo, we don't see all the interim data\nthat's being manipulated and moved on,\n\n597\n00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:47.540\nwe only get the final output at the end of\nfinal round, very, very final last thing.\n\n598\n00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:49.970\nWe see the cipher text\npopping up at that side.\n\n599\n00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:53.120\nSo, we don't actually get to see\nthat until we're totally done.\n\n600\n00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:56.060\nAnd so, there's a lot of\ninterim steps that go on, but\n\n601\n00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:58.080\nwe just don't actually\nhave visibility into them,\n\n602\n00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.880\nunless we're actually looking at this and\nseeing what it would look like.\n\n603\n00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:04.480\nNow, speaking of looking, thought it may\nbe interesting just to take a look at\n\n604\n00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.480\nwhat this may represent itself as.\n\n605\n00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:10.530\nYou've seen me use crypto tool,\nor crypt tool before.\n\n606\n00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:14.900\nWhen we talk about how this works, and\nI thought it would be interesting for\n\n607\n00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:17.410\nus to take a look at Crypt Tool and\n\n608\n00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:21.270\njust see what some of these\nalgorithms may look like.\n\n609\n00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:22.370\nSo what we wanna do, and\n\n610\n00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:26.250\njust give me one second here, is I thought\nit would be interesting to bring up.\n\n611\n00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:30.370\nAnd I just have to select AES,\nbecause I did not select it, so\n\n612\n00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:33.140\nlet me just do this, and let me do, oops.\n\n613\n00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:37.170\nI'll click here, let's bring up AES.\n\n614\n00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:39.990\nAnd let me just launch the AES.\n\n615\n00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:43.410\nYou'll see it load here,\nlet's launch the AES cipher,\n\n616\n00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:46.200\nand let's just take a look visually\nwhat AES actually looks like, right.\n\n617\n00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.770\nSo we did this in one of the other\nepisodes if you remember.\n\n618\n00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:51.430\nCan we go full, yeah, I was gonna say,\nthank you, we go full screen, you'll see,\n\n619\n00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:53.040\nand we'll draw to what\nwe're talking about.\n\n620\n00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:56.510\nWe actually did this in one of\nthe episodes and we went through,\n\n621\n00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:58.340\nwe took a look at the Vigenère cipher.\n\n622\n00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:00.440\nWe took a look at the Playfair, right?\n\n623\n00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:03.860\nThe ADVFGVX, right?\n\n624\n00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:06.080\nSo we went through and\ndid a bunch of these.\n\n625\n00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.620\nBut in this one, with AS,\nyou could see we have,\n\n626\n00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:14.020\nyou'll see some text input the quick\nbrown fox jumps over the lazy dog, right?\n\n627\n00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:15.930\nAnd then, we are gonna go through.\n\n628\n00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:18.090\nLet's just take a look visually\nat this before we run it.\n\n629\n00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:20.380\nWe're gonna then go through, and\n\n630\n00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:24.500\nwe have our AES cryptographic\nfunction right in here.\n\n631\n00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:26.790\nSo we have our encrypt action,\nkey size 128 bits.\n\n632\n00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:30.070\nWe're gonna take a look at and\ntalk about chaining.\n\n633\n00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:33.540\nAnd padding mode will come up when\nwe start talking about block and\n\n634\n00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:35.360\nstring ciphers and how they work.\n\n635\n00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:39.430\nBut we have our chaining mode, so that\nwe're gonna take the output of one round\n\n636\n00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:42.640\nand use it as the input for the next,\nso we're gonna pass it through.\n\n637\n00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:45.680\nIt becomes the input for\na certain number of rounds.\n\n638\n00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:49.150\nAnd that way, we're obfuscating\nfurther creating confusion and\n\n639\n00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:53.710\ndiffusion, because every time that\nwe get the Interim, cipher text,\n\n640\n00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:58.270\noutput, the resultant, we're gonna\nuse that and pass that through, so\n\n641\n00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:00.170\nthat it becomes the input for\nthe next round.\n\n642\n00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:05.190\nBut if we can't reverse that back and have\nthat show up exactly the right way for\n\n643\n00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:08.950\nthe number of rounds in reverse,\nwe won't get the original plain text back.\n\n644\n00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:11.430\nSo it makes it even harder as\nwe talked about to do this.\n\n645\n00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:12.929\nSo we've got all this.\n\n646\n00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:18.020\nAnd then, ultimately, over here,\nwe get out our output.\n\n647\n00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:19.240\nSo let's just take a look at this.\n\n648\n00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:20.330\nWe'll run this through.\n\n649\n00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:22.290\nAnd as I talked about in one\nof the earlier episodes,\n\n650\n00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:26.200\nwe did this, like this tool so\nmuch, CrypTool 2.0.\n\n651\n00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:29.150\nIt is an open-source\nvisualization tool for\n\n652\n00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:32.070\ncryptographic algorithms and\nshows you how they work.\n\n653\n00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:35.790\nYou could do development on the platform,\nwrite your own representations.\n\n654\n00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:39.520\nThe people that maintain this\ndo a phenomenal job, it's free.\n\n655\n00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.450\nWe told you where to find it in\none of the earlier episodes,\n\n656\n00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:43.190\nI encourage to go out and\nget a look at this.\n\n657\n00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:44.540\nDownload it, play with it.\n\n658\n00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:47.097\nYou just need the dot net framework 4.0 so\nit does run on\n\n659\n00:31:47.097 --> 00:31:50.472\na Windows environment using Dot net\nframework to do the representations.\n\n660\n00:31:50.472 --> 00:31:54.201\nAnd it's got all the templates for\nall the algorithms we're talking about so\n\n661\n00:31:54.201 --> 00:31:56.676\nyou can play with them and\nbetter understand them.\n\n662\n00:31:56.676 --> 00:31:59.638\nSo let's just take a look, we'll hit the\nplay button here, we'll run this through.\n\n663\n00:31:59.638 --> 00:32:04.037\nAnd when we do, let's go up here,\nso we can see that.\n\n664\n00:32:04.037 --> 00:32:05.048\nLet's scroll up.\n\n665\n00:32:05.048 --> 00:32:09.369\nWe could see that the output of\nthe quick brown fox jumps over or\n\n666\n00:32:09.369 --> 00:32:14.200\nthe quick brown whatever jumps over\nthe lazy whatever, what was it?\n\n667\n00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:15.896\nThe quick brown fox\njumps over the lazy dog.\n\n668\n00:32:15.896 --> 00:32:16.441\n&gt;&gt; Lazy dog.\n\n669\n00:32:16.441 --> 00:32:18.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, lazy dog, right?\n\n670\n00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:23.940\nSo that, when we are done,\nwinds up being this right here.\n\n671\n00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:27.110\nAnd that's what we would\nactually see as the cipher text.\n\n672\n00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:30.350\nWe would get that out using AES, right?\n\n673\n00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:32.970\nSo when we encrypt, it looks like that.\n\n674\n00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:37.130\nIf we run it backwards and we run it\nthrough the process going the other way,\n\n675\n00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:40.180\nwe would get the quick brown\nfox jumps over the lazy dog.\n\n676\n00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:43.090\nIf that's indeed what the plain\ntext was that we are gonna use.\n\n677\n00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:47.087\nSo when we talk about these algorithms,\nand we talk about how they work,\n\n678\n00:32:47.087 --> 00:32:49.848\nit's sometimes good to visualize them,\nright?\n\n679\n00:32:49.848 --> 00:32:51.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And to actually see them.\n\n680\n00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:55.030\nLet's go ahead, since we're here, let's\ntake a look at one more I pre-loaded,\n\n681\n00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:57.420\njust a couple of templates up so\nwe can look at them.\n\n682\n00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:00.092\nLet's take a look at Triple DES,\nyou wanna see Triple DES?\n\n683\n00:33:00.092 --> 00:33:00.870\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n684\n00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:02.578\n&gt;&gt; Why don't we do that one,\nso let's go ahead and\n\n685\n00:33:02.578 --> 00:33:04.680\nlet's take a look at\nTriple DES real quick.\n\n686\n00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:06.180\nWe'll load this one up.\n\n687\n00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:08.460\nAnd so we can see, Hello world!\n\n688\n00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:10.010\nThis is a test, right?\n\n689\n00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:11.890\nSo we can take this, right?\n\n690\n00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:14.070\nAnd we start to run this\nthrough the encrypt function.\n\n691\n00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:15.690\nYou can see it here.\n\n692\n00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:17.709\nAnd if this is our key, right,\n\n693\n00:33:17.709 --> 00:33:22.231\nremember we need the key of a certain\nbit length, whatever it may be.\n\n694\n00:33:22.231 --> 00:33:26.800\nAnd we run that through\nour DES encrypt function.\n\n695\n00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:31.350\nAnd then what we will have over here,\nlet's just scroll over.\n\n696\n00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:33.170\nThis is Triple DES by the way, right?\n\n697\n00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:36.240\nSo when we are done,\nwe'll get our output here, right?\n\n698\n00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:41.450\nSo let's just take a look, see what\nthis looks like, run that through.\n\n699\n00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:45.840\nAnd so when we run that and\ndo the combination with the key, right,\n\n700\n00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:52.550\nwe get a stream that looks like\nthis as our cipher text and\n\n701\n00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:57.580\ndown here, we get our, just to show us,\nremind us what it was, right?\n\n702\n00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:58.088\nThat's our plain text.\n\n703\n00:33:58.088 --> 00:34:01.580\nYou can see,\nessentially what they equate to.\n\n704\n00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:02.652\nIf we could probably put them both,\n\n705\n00:34:02.652 --> 00:34:04.883\nthere we go, probably put them both on\nthe same screen so you can see them.\n\n706\n00:34:04.883 --> 00:34:06.150\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n707\n00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:08.500\n&gt;&gt; So that's what Triple DES would\nlook like when we run it through.\n\n708\n00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:12.660\nSo when we're talking about some of these\nalgorithms, it's always good to go back,\n\n709\n00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:14.130\nat least on occasion anyway, right?\n\n710\n00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:15.950\nIt may be good to go back and\ntake a look and\n\n711\n00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:20.100\njust get a better sense of how these\nrun just to visualize them, right?\n\n712\n00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:20.733\nIt's always helpful to\ntake a look at that.\n\n713\n00:34:20.733 --> 00:34:23.253\n&gt;&gt; Well,\neven when you hovered over the name AES,\n\n714\n00:34:23.253 --> 00:34:26.725\nit had a huge paragraph there on the-\n&gt;&gt; It does, so it actually, that's nice,\n\n715\n00:34:26.725 --> 00:34:27.514\nyou can see it there.\n\n716\n00:34:27.514 --> 00:34:30.180\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot of information, more than-\n&gt;&gt; It tells us the history.\n\n717\n00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:31.180\nYou can probably get the pop-up.\n\n718\n00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:32.094\nI just had it right there.\n\n719\n00:34:32.094 --> 00:34:32.693\n&gt;&gt; Cool, so that's a ton.\n\n720\n00:34:32.693 --> 00:34:35.950\n&gt;&gt; It tells you, it comes from Wikipedia,\nit tells you exactly where to get it from.\n\n721\n00:34:35.950 --> 00:34:40.410\nYou do it on every template when you go\nin, and you go into the template itself.\n\n722\n00:34:40.410 --> 00:34:42.843\nIt actually brings up the little\nsummary or history of whatever it was.\n\n723\n00:34:42.843 --> 00:34:47.030\nAnd it actually shows you, a lot of\nthem are notated, not every one is but\n\n724\n00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:48.069\nmost of them are.\n\n725\n00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:51.527\nAnd AES has, it's probably the first\nseveral paragraph I would guess probably\n\n726\n00:34:51.527 --> 00:34:53.964\nfrom the Wikipedia entry,\nI'm guessing most likely.\n\n727\n00:34:53.964 --> 00:34:55.464\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha, I know you had mentioned it,\nbut I just saw that and\n\n728\n00:34:55.464 --> 00:34:56.280\nI was like whoa, that's a lot.\n\n729\n00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, kind of goes through,\ntells you what it is and\n\n730\n00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:00.450\njust tells you what the summary is.\n\n731\n00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:01.990\nSo it does show you, which is good.\n\n732\n00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:05.230\nIt also gives you the history,\na lot of stuff we've been talking about,\n\n733\n00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:07.150\ngives you the background and\nthe information.\n\n734\n00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:08.936\nBut as always, they're good to cite that.\n\n735\n00:35:08.936 --> 00:35:12.785\nThe people that are maintaining the tool\nare very good about citing where they get\n\n736\n00:35:12.785 --> 00:35:16.479\nthat from, so you know where to go back\nto, so they give you the information.\n\n737\n00:35:16.479 --> 00:35:21.276\nObviously standard disclaimer, most things\non Wikipedia are vetted pretty well and\n\n738\n00:35:21.276 --> 00:35:22.879\nare usually pretty spot on.\n\n739\n00:35:22.879 --> 00:35:26.476\nBut you always wanna read the little\ndisclaimers at the top of the entries.\n\n740\n00:35:26.476 --> 00:35:29.758\nSometimes it says hey,\nwe need some more references.\n\n741\n00:35:29.758 --> 00:35:33.187\nOr maybe this is out of date, and\nthis needs to be updated with this and so\n\n742\n00:35:33.187 --> 00:35:36.616\nyou always just wanna exercise a little\ndue care when you go out there and\n\n743\n00:35:36.616 --> 00:35:38.270\nlook at this information.\n\n744\n00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:39.880\nThings do change sometimes over time.\n\n745\n00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:43.437\nWe always wanna make sure that we're\nseeing the most accurate representation of\n\n746\n00:35:43.437 --> 00:35:44.335\nthis information.\n\n747\n00:35:44.335 --> 00:35:48.698\nAnd maybe cross referencing it with one or\nanother source would also be good.\n\n748\n00:35:48.698 --> 00:35:51.180\nSomething like maybe the book\nyou've been mentioning, right,\n\n749\n00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:54.218\nwould be one way to do that,\nor whatever the case may be.\n\n750\n00:35:54.218 --> 00:35:55.870\nSo just wanna think about that and\nbe aware of that,\n\n751\n00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:58.560\nbut it's a nice way to\nlook at the algorithms.\n\n752\n00:35:58.560 --> 00:35:59.924\nAnd hopefully bring them to life,\n\n753\n00:35:59.924 --> 00:36:02.852\ngive you a little ability to better\nunderstand them and see how they work.\n\n754\n00:36:02.852 --> 00:36:08.770\n&gt;&gt; Great, so in this episode, we were\nable to look DES, Triple DES, DES X, AES.\n\n755\n00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:11.870\nI have a feeling we have more to go,\nso stay tuned, ladies and gentleman.\n\n756\n00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:14.160\nBut for this show,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n757\n00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.270\nI'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n758\n00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:15.876\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n759\n00:36:15.876 --> 00:36:17.651\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n760\n00:36:17.651 -->

00:00:08.242\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:11.776\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.776 --> 00:00:13.819\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your ECES series.\n\n6\n00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:15.538\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:15.538 --> 00:00:19.733\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna\nbe looking at Doctor Seuss books.\n\n8\n00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:24.287\nWe've got blue fish,\nTwofish, Blowfish, Serpent.\n\n9\n00:00:24.287 --> 00:00:29.221\n[LAUGH] Something like that,\nno blue fish, Blowfish.\n\n10\n00:00:29.221 --> 00:00:31.340\nBut that book, the red fish blue fish.\n\n11\n00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.370\nSo with us today we have Mr Adam Gordon\nto help us through this nursery rhyme.\n\n12\n00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.140\nThank you for joining us today Adam.\n\n13\n00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.975\n&gt;&gt; Hello everybody.\n\n14\n00:00:37.975 --> 00:00:41.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's continue talking\n\n15\n00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.316\nabout as we have been for it seems\nlike I don't know six episodes now.\n\n16\n00:00:47.316 --> 00:00:51.738\nTalking about symmetric encryption,\nsymmetric cryptography.\n\n17\n00:00:51.738 --> 00:00:56.033\nWe're gonna round out our conversations\nhere about block ciphers.\n\n18\n00:00:56.033 --> 00:00:59.429\nWe're gonna talk about stream\nciphers here, little RC4,\n\n19\n00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:02.650\nlittle MD5 for\nhashing thrown in for good measure.\n\n20\n00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.320\nWe'll get to that as well,\nand if you're really,\n\n21\n00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.270\nreally good then Miss Cherokee is gonna\ntell you a nursery rhyme when we're done.\n\n22\n00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.180\nShe's gonna whip out her Mother Goose and\nsee if she can run through that.\n\n23\n00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.040\n&gt;&gt; But it has to be a Dr. Seuss one.\n\n24\n00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.151\n&gt;&gt; Mother Goose, Dr.\nSeuss it's all the same.\n\n25\n00:01:17.151 --> 00:01:17.975\n&gt;&gt; Okay, [LAUGH].\n\n26\n00:01:17.975 --> 00:01:20.046\n&gt;&gt; So I actually had a friend,\nwhen I was working at the U.N.\n\n27\n00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:21.284\nI worked at the U.N. for a while.\n\n28\n00:01:21.284 --> 00:01:26.370\nBasically I was there doing\na bunch of different stuff.\n\n29\n00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.230\nBut I had a friend when I was there,\nThe Model UN Program,\n\n30\n00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.970\nthe actual Model UN Program and\nthere, I'll never forget.\n\n31\n00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.330\nSo he was able to recite the entire\nbook of Green Eggs and Ham by memory.\n\n32\n00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.160\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n33\n00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.600\n&gt;&gt; So he had memorized the whole book.\n\n34\n00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.622\nAnd so.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n35\n00:01:44.622 --> 00:01:46.830\n&gt;&gt; We would be out somewhere just randomly\n\n36\n00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:47.680\ndoing something.\n\n37\n00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nWhere's that gonna get you?\n\n38\n00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.448\n&gt;&gt; Typically involving drinking.\n\n39\n00:01:49.448 --> 00:01:50.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; More often than not.\n\n40\n00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.770\nAnd he would be able to\njust break into verse.\n\n41\n00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.850\nAnd he could rip through Green Eggs and\nHam, cover to cover.\n\n42\n00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:58.382\n&gt;&gt; Nobody's business.\n\n43\n00:01:58.382 --> 00:02:00.982\n&gt;&gt; Just amazing, amazing.\n\n44\n00:02:00.982 --> 00:02:05.990\nHe went on to become, and still is,\nto this day, very involved in politics.\n\n45\n00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.960\nHe's actually a campaign analyst,\ncampaign manager kind of person.\n\n46\n00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.242\nGraduated from Georgetown School\nof Campaign Management there.\n\n47\n00:02:14.242 --> 00:02:18.010\nAnd does campaign management for\nall sorts of politicians.\n\n48\n00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.680\nBut, just really phenomenal memory.\n\n49\n00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.870\nJust crazy, crazy stuff.\n\n50\n00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.445\nSo now that we've had our random aside,\ntotally unrelated.\n\n51\n00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:26.820\nBut this one is totally your fault,\n\n52\n00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.060\nbecause you started down the whole\nDoctor Seuss, Mother Goose nursery rhyme.\n\n53\n00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.960\n&gt;&gt; But we are really gonna\nbe looking at Blowfish.\n\n54\n00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.915\n&gt;&gt; We are gonna to talk about Blowfish and\nTwofish.\n\n55\n00:02:35.915 --> 00:02:39.200\n[LAUGH] But that is the extent of what\nwe're gonna talk about with red fish,\n\n56\n00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.860\nblue fish, one fish, two fish.\n\n57\n00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.080\nFish for me, fish you you,\nBlowfish, and Twofish.\n\n58\n00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.605\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; So let's talk about those algorithms,\n\n59\n00:02:44.605 --> 00:02:45.634\nso let's start with Blowfish.\n\n60\n00:02:45.634 --> 00:02:49.280\nWe're just gonna run down the remaining\nlist on some of those block ciphers.\n\n61\n00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.827\nTalk just a little bit at a high\nlevel about what they are, one or\n\n62\n00:02:51.827 --> 00:02:53.136\ntwo sentences traditionally.\n\n63\n00:02:53.136 --> 00:02:55.654\nWe're gonna hit the highlight,\nand most likely who's behind it.\n\n64\n00:02:55.654 --> 00:02:58.753\nSo if there are some names there,\nmaybe valuable for you to know.\n\n65\n00:02:58.753 --> 00:02:59.892\nWe'll put those out.\n\n66\n00:02:59.892 --> 00:03:03.505\nWe're gonna talk about the key,\nmost likely, how big is the key?\n\n67\n00:03:03.505 --> 00:03:07.045\nIf it's random, in terms of arrange,\nlet's talk about that.\n\n68\n00:03:07.045 --> 00:03:12.920\nAnd if we have a block size, we're gonna\ntalk about that traditionally as well.\n\n69\n00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.770\nSo I'm gonna put some notes up just\nbecause it's gonna be hard for\n\n70\n00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.290\nyou to remember all this stuff.\n\n71\n00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.902\nI start spouting out names,\nand bit sizes, and everything.\n\n72\n00:03:18.902 --> 00:03:20.487\nSo we're gonna go to some notes just so\n\n73\n00:03:20.487 --> 00:03:22.426\nyou guys can see them\na little bit easier here.\n\n74\n00:03:22.426 --> 00:03:25.085\nAnd we'll just be able to\nrun through them real quick.\n\n75\n00:03:25.085 --> 00:03:27.778\nAll of this is in the show notes for\nyou'll so you'll have all this.\n\n76\n00:03:27.778 --> 00:03:30.541\nBut you could see Blowfish,\n16-round Feistel cipher.\n\n77\n00:03:30.541 --> 00:03:34.081\nYou know what that is now if you've\nbeen through our prior episodes and\n\n78\n00:03:34.081 --> 00:03:35.585\nconversations with us.\n\n79\n00:03:35.585 --> 00:03:40.335\nIf not we did a whole big discussion\non the Feistel cipher, Feistel network.\n\n80\n00:03:40.335 --> 00:03:42.305\nIt's referred to by different names.\n\n81\n00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:44.565\nYou may wanna go back,\nlisten to that episode and\n\n82\n00:03:44.565 --> 00:03:45.878\nmake sure you're comfortable with that.\n\n83\n00:03:45.878 --> 00:03:49.610\nBut 16 round Feistel\ncipher on a 64-bit block.\n\n84\n00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.535\nUnlike DES,\nwe can have a varying key size.\n\n85\n00:03:51.535 --> 00:03:55.307\nRemember, DES was gonna\nwork with a 56-bit key.\n\n86\n00:03:55.307 --> 00:03:56.189\nIt was not variables.\n\n87\n00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:57.109\nIt was 56 bits.\n\n88\n00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:03.320\n64 bit total, eight bits out for parity,\n56 bit actual key for DES, right?\n\n89\n00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.780\nThe Blowfish cipher is implanted\nwith a variable key size,\n\n90\n00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.560\nfrom 32 bits up to 448 bits.\n\n91\n00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.180\nDesigned by your favorite\nperson in the world, right?\n\n92\n00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.840\nThe person you always talk about,\nBruce Schneier, right?\n\n93\n00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.100\nSo we are mentioning him in a couple\nof different places, actually.\n\n94\n00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.670\nAs I believe I talked\nabout in a prior episode,\n\n95\n00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.440\nhis work is actually going to underly\nseveral algorithms, not just Blowfish.\n\n96\n00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.410\nBut we'll seem him as one of they key\ncontributors to several algorithms, so\n\n97\n00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.810\nwe'll call him out when he does.\n\n98\n00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.390\nSerpent, I know I mentioned\nthat one in the list, and\n\n99\n00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.870\nyou said you hadn't heard\nof that one before, right?\n\n100\n00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.550\nSo that's a new one for you.\n\n101\n00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.540\nAES is similar to Serpent in this respect.\n\n102\n00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.920\nOr you could say, I guess, in theory,\nSerpent is similar to AES,\n\n103\n00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.220\nhowever you would think of it.\n\n104\n00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.255\nBut Serpent has a block size of 128 bits.\n\n105\n00:04:45.255 --> 00:04:50.470\nJust like AES, variable key size,\n128, 192, or 256 bits.\n\n106\n00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.670\nSo similar to AES in that respect, right?\n\n107\n00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.529\nIt is also a substitution permutation\nnetwork, so it's very similar to AES.\n\n108\n00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:01.720\n32 rounds working with\nthe block of four 32 bit words.\n\n109\n00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.740\nEach round applies one of eight four\nby four four bit to four bit s boxes.\n\n110\n00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.180\nSo we've talked about\nthat with AES as well.\n\n111\n00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.890\n32 times in parallel,\nAES doesn't do 32 rounds.\n\n112\n00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.860\nThat's the key difference\nbetween Serpent and AES.\n\n113\n00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.910\nDesigned by Ross Anderson, Eli Biham,\n\n114\n00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.040\nor Biham I guess depending on how\nyour pronounce it, and Lars Goodson.\n\n115\n00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.740\nSo the three people that contributed\nto that one so it's not as common.\n\n116\n00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:25.811\nYou don't hear about it as often.\n\n117\n00:05:25.811 --> 00:05:28.331\nIt's just not deployed\nas often commercially so\n\n118\n00:05:28.331 --> 00:05:29.933\nyou just don't hear about it.\n\n119\n00:05:29.933 --> 00:05:31.710\nBut it is still a very viable algorithm.\n\n120\n00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.190\nAnd it's still in use today.\n\n121\n00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.145\nTwofish, another one designed by Mr.\nSchneier among others.\n\n122\n00:05:37.145 --> 00:05:41.510\nSo you can see John Kelsey, Doug Whiting,\nDavid Wagner, Chris Hall and\n\n123\n00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.040\nNiels Ferguson all contributed.\n\n124\n00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:50.010\nBut a block size 128 bits and\nkey sizes up to 250 bits for Twofish.\n\n125\n00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.970\nSkipjack, as you can see here.\n\n126\n00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.270\nYou and I were talking about Skipjack,\njust before we came on.\n\n127\n00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.350\nSo Skipjack, many people may or\nmay not remember.\n\n128\n00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.660\nIt depends really on how old you are.\n\n129\n00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.070\nBut if you're of a certain age or\nolder, you may remember a little\n\n130\n00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.778\nflap that occurred, back in the 1990s and\nearly 2000s, around this.\n\n131\n00:06:08.778 --> 00:06:14.580\nWhere the NSA, as in yes, that NSA, right?\n\n132\n00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.925\nWho's probably listening as we speak.\n\n133\n00:06:15.925 --> 00:06:18.885\nBut that NSA,\nthe one we all are familiar with,\n\n134\n00:06:18.885 --> 00:06:22.144\nthe National Security Agency\nin the United States.\n\n135\n00:06:22.144 --> 00:06:26.340\nTried to get involved in the hey,\nlet's make an algorithm business, right?\n\n136\n00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.320\nAnd so, under the guise of\nsomething known as the clipper chip\n\n137\n00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.600\nthey tried to push the commercial\nuse of the Skipjack algorithm.\n\n138\n00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.750\nAnd most people don't know it is Skipjack\nwhen I called it the clipper chip.\n\n139\n00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:36.840\nYou and I talked about it.\n\n140\n00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.280\nYou remember it more as a clipper chip.\n\n141\n00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.450\nYou didn't really make the connection\nwith Skipjack cuz most people don't\n\n142\n00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:42.340\nknow it is Skipjack.\n\n143\n00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.795\nBut they remember the whole\nthing around clipper chip.\n\n144\n00:06:44.795 --> 00:06:47.335\nThe idea was that they were\ngonna commercially produce.\n\n145\n00:06:47.335 --> 00:06:52.670\nAnd put these chips into basically every\npiece of electronic gear on the planet.\n\n146\n00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:54.600\nAnd they were gonna use as you can see,\nright?\n\n147\n00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.360\nThe algorithm would use an 80 bit key to\nencrypt or decrypt 64 bit data blocks.\n\n148\n00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.190\nHowever what's not there, and\n\n149\n00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:04.724\nwhat's most important is that\nthe NSA have the requirement.\n\n150\n00:07:04.724 --> 00:07:09.542\nThat you would escrow the decryption\nkey with a quote unquote holding entity\n\n151\n00:07:09.542 --> 00:07:12.413\nthat was really controlled by them, right?\n\n152\n00:07:12.413 --> 00:07:13.415\nAnd as a result,\n\n153\n00:07:13.415 --> 00:07:18.220\nthey would have a back door key to get\ninto any encryption done with this system.\n\n154\n00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.149\n&gt;&gt; Raised a few eyebrows.\n\n155\n00:07:19.149 --> 00:07:21.157\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nwhen that became public knowledge,\n\n156\n00:07:21.157 --> 00:07:23.700\nthat was basically the end\nto that conversation.\n\n157\n00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:24.650\nThat never went forward.\n\n158\n00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:25.958\nThis really never saw the light of day.\n\n159\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:29.174\nIn a meaningful way,\nit was never commercially implemented.\n\n160\n00:07:29.174 --> 00:07:33.890\nIn anything that would approach the vision\nof what they thought they could get.\n\n161\n00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.800\nBut there was this, and\nthis is well documented, you go back and\n\n162\n00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.750\nlook it up, read up on it if you'd like.\n\n163\n00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:42.758\nBut, this actually was something that\nwas tried in the United States, and\n\n164\n00:07:42.758 --> 00:07:44.485\nas I said did not work very well.\n\n165\n00:07:44.485 --> 00:07:46.892\nBut, out of it we get\nthe Skipjack algorithm,\n\n166\n00:07:46.892 --> 00:07:50.310\neven though it was not implemented\nformally in the clipper chip.\n\n167\n00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:53.187\nThe clipper chip was the actual\nhardware that was gonna be used\n\n168\n00:07:53.187 --> 00:07:55.303\nto do the encryption, decryption on board.\n\n169\n00:07:55.303 --> 00:07:57.685\nThat was the chip they were\ngonna produce and use.\n\n170\n00:07:57.685 --> 00:07:59.543\nBut it would implement\nthe Skipjack algorithm.\n\n171\n00:07:59.543 --> 00:08:01.430\nSo it's just kinda funny.\n\n172\n00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:04.870\nBut it did, and I mentioned this when we\ndid the deep dive on the Feistel network.\n\n173\n00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:08.040\nIt did use an unbalanced\nFeistel network with 32 rounds.\n\n174\n00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:13.060\nIf you remember, the unbalanced Feistel\nnetwork was the chunking of the data into\n\n175\n00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.830\nthe baskets slash actual blocks.\n\n176\n00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.980\nAnd the baskets would\nhave been unbalanced.\n\n177\n00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.050\nWouldn't have just had two of equal size,\n\n178\n00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:25.000\nwe would have had baskets with\nvarying sizes of bits in them.\n\n179\n00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.250\nThat would be the unbalanced\nFeistel network.\n\n180\n00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:29.370\nSo that's what Skipjack was.\n\n181\n00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:32.680\nIDEA stands for\nInternational Data Encryption Algorithm.\n\n182\n00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:33.760\nTry to spell those out for\n\n183\n00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.248\nyou when we have them if you\nmay not know what they are.\n\n184\n00:08:36.248 --> 00:08:39.160\nDesigned by Mr.\nMassey there, James Massey.\n\n185\n00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.310\nAnd I'm not even gonna attempt to\npronounce the name correctly cuz I\n\n186\n00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:44.090\nprobably will not be able to.\n\n187\n00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:51.342\nBut you could see,\nI'm gonna say X-U-E-J-I-A, Xuejia Li.\n\n188\n00:08:51.342 --> 00:08:53.070\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct or not.\n\n189\n00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:56.678\nSo I do apologize if I did\nmispronounce the name.\n\n190\n00:08:56.678 --> 00:09:00.180\nBut those two people actually created or\nwere behind IDEA.\n\n191\n00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.819\nOperates on a 64-bit\nblock with a 128-bit key.\n\n192\n00:09:03.819 --> 00:09:07.578\nAnd you could see we do series of eight\nidentical transformations for each round.\n\n193\n00:09:07.578 --> 00:09:11.110\nAnd then the output transformation\non the backend when we're done.\n\n194\n00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:14.870\nSo these are all of the block\nalgorithms that we have talked about,\n\n195\n00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:16.110\nor block ciphers.\n\n196\n00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:20.490\nWe also talked about the fact that we\ncan implement symmetric algorithms and\n\n197\n00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:24.098\nsymmetric cryptography through\nthe concept of a stream cipher.\n\n198\n00:09:24.098 --> 00:09:26.865\nAnd stream ciphers are gonna operate,\nremember,\n\n199\n00:09:26.865 --> 00:09:28.741\non a linear conveyor belt of bits.\n\n200\n00:09:28.741 --> 00:09:33.038\nThey're gonna operate one bit at\na time continuously instead of filling\n\n201\n00:09:33.038 --> 00:09:37.829\nup the basket or the actual block with a\ncertain number of bits before they operate\n\n202\n00:09:37.829 --> 00:09:41.620\nas an asynchronous as opposed\nto synchronous solution.\n\n203\n00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:45.615\nSo RC4, FISH and\nPIKE are examples of stream ciphers.\n\n204\n00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:49.355\nYou may or\nmay not have heard of some of these.\n\n205\n00:09:49.355 --> 00:09:52.623\nMost people have no idea what FISH and\nPIKE are when we talk about them.\n\n206\n00:09:52.623 --> 00:09:54.647\nBut they're simply just examples of this.\n\n207\n00:09:54.647 --> 00:09:55.584\n&gt;&gt; I think it's a type of fish.\n\n208\n00:09:55.584 --> 00:09:56.306\n&gt;&gt; A lot of people have heard of RC4.\n\n209\n00:09:56.306 --> 00:09:58.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Pike's a type of fish, exactly.\n\n210\n00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.510\nSo not far off from it, believe it or\nnot, when we talk about FISH and PIKE.\n\n211\n00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:05.960\nCuz PIKE is essentially a stronger\nimplementation of FISH.\n\n212\n00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.184\nTo improve on the security based\non a weakness that was found.\n\n213\n00:10:08.184 --> 00:10:10.332\n&gt;&gt; And we also have variance of RC, right?\n\n214\n00:10:10.332 --> 00:10:12.491\n&gt;&gt; So there's RC4, RC5, RC6.\n\n215\n00:10:12.491 --> 00:10:15.880\nThere's multiple RC algorithms\nthat are out there.\n\n216\n00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.730\nAnd most people are familiar with one or\nmore of them.\n\n217\n00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:20.520\nBut yes, there are variations as well.\n\n218\n00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:26.600\nSo RC4 comes to us from Ron Rivest, who is\none of the three principals behind RSA.\n\n219\n00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:32.470\nRon Rivest, Adleman, and\nShamir, so all three of them.\n\n220\n00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:35.675\nBut the R in RSA is also the R in RC.\n\n221\n00:10:35.675 --> 00:10:37.380\nAnd it is a name for him.\n\n222\n00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.830\nThe algorithms used,\nessentially as you could see there.\n\n223\n00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:43.210\nTo do encryption and decryption,\nwe simply are just XORing with the key.\n\n224\n00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:46.050\nIt's a relatively straightforward\nvariation on a theme.\n\n225\n00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:49.360\nVariable length key from 1 to 2048 bits.\n\n226\n00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:54.060\nNow, interestingly, for RC4 in particular,\nthere is some discussion out there.\n\n227\n00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:56.151\nAnd you can read up on\nthe Wiki page on RC4.\n\n228\n00:10:56.151 --> 00:10:58.440\nAnd it's an interesting\nreading if you go take a look.\n\n229\n00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:03.873\nYou can implement RC4 with as little as\n1-bit key all the way up to 2048 bits.\n\n230\n00:11:03.873 --> 00:11:06.554\nNow if you know anything about what\nwe've been talking about in the last\n\n231\n00:11:06.554 --> 00:11:07.322\nseveral episodes.\n\n232\n00:11:07.322 --> 00:11:09.493\nAnd have hopefully been\npaying attention and\n\n233\n00:11:09.493 --> 00:11:12.245\ntaken away some of the conversation and\nthe intent of it.\n\n234\n00:11:12.245 --> 00:11:16.070\nYou would know that the smaller the key,\nobviously, the weaker it is.\n\n235\n00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:18.840\nSo nobody would ever implement\nthis thing with a 1-bit key.\n\n236\n00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.980\nExcept just for purposes of demonstration.\n\n237\n00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:24.270\nAnd as I put there in the brackets,\nor the parentheses.\n\n238\n00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:25.820\nI never know what to call those things,\nby the way.\n\n239\n00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:26.767\nThis is our random aside.\n\n240\n00:11:26.767 --> 00:11:29.348\nIn case you're not familiar with\nour little thought process here,\n\n241\n00:11:29.348 --> 00:11:30.855\nI never know what to call those things.\n\n242\n00:11:30.855 --> 00:11:32.100\n&gt;&gt; Those are definitely parentheses.\n\n243\n00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:32.970\n&gt;&gt; Those are parentheses.\n\n244\n00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:34.837\nI always get them confused with braces and\nbrackets.\n\n245\n00:11:34.837 --> 00:11:38.450\nCuz I do a lot of PowerShell,\na lot of scripting, a lot of stuff.\n\n246\n00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:40.120\nAnd I always get confused.\n\n247\n00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:40.697\nI never know what to call them.\n\n248\n00:11:40.697 --> 00:11:43.549\nSo I always just refer to everything\nas parentheses even though they're\n\n249\n00:11:43.549 --> 00:11:44.420\nnot always.\n\n250\n00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:48.910\nBut in the parentheses there, a minimum of\n40 bits or higher to be considered secure.\n\n251\n00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:52.420\nSo really the key has to be at\nleast a 40-bit key to be secure.\n\n252\n00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:57.005\nClearly, if we go all the way up to\n2048 bits, way more secure than 40 bits.\n\n253\n00:11:57.005 --> 00:12:01.225\nBut the stronger the bit strength of\nthe key, the larger the key space,\n\n254\n00:12:01.225 --> 00:12:02.155\nthe higher the work factor.\n\n255\n00:12:02.155 --> 00:12:04.305\nWe've talked about all this stuff and\nwhy this is important.\n\n256\n00:12:04.305 --> 00:12:07.495\nBut know for RC4, minimum of 40 bits or\n\n257\n00:12:07.495 --> 00:12:10.295\nhigher to be considered secure,\njust so you know.\n\n258\n00:12:10.295 --> 00:12:12.975\nMost people think of RC4 and say, yeah,\n\n259\n00:12:12.975 --> 00:12:16.281\nanything from maybe 40\nto 256 bits is common.\n\n260\n00:12:16.281 --> 00:12:20.914\nSo you may sometimes see documentation\nthat says, the key size is between 40 and\n\n261\n00:12:20.914 --> 00:12:21.960\n256 bits.\n\n262\n00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.134\nBut it's actually between 1 and 2048.\n\n263\n00:12:25.134 --> 00:12:28.545\nBut commonly,\n40 is the minimum point we would accept.\n\n264\n00:12:28.545 --> 00:12:30.710\nSo as a result, we tend to start there.\n\n265\n00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:32.420\nSo you could see that.\n\n266\n00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:36.000\nAnd as a result, we refer to RC4 as\nbeing one of the stream ciphers.\n\n267\n00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.415\nWe also have FISH, which stands for,\nas you could see there, Fibonacci.\n\n268\n00:12:40.415 --> 00:12:42.200\nAnd that's how you do pronounce that.\n\n269\n00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.679\nThe Fibonacci shrinking cipher.\n\n270\n00:12:44.679 --> 00:12:46.880\nThat's what it's referred to commonly as.\n\n271\n00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.793\nSiemens, as in the German\nengineering company, Siemens,\n\n272\n00:12:49.793 --> 00:12:51.515\nactually put this out in 1993.\n\n273\n00:12:51.515 --> 00:12:54.890\nSo interesting, they do all sorts\nof stuff and they are behind this.\n\n274\n00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:57.494\nSoftware-based stream cipher,\nas you can see,\n\n275\n00:12:57.494 --> 00:13:00.860\nthat uses what's called\na Lagged Fibonacci generator.\n\n276\n00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:04.829\nCommonly, we refer to that as just\na derivative of a more general thought\n\n277\n00:13:04.829 --> 00:13:08.040\nprocess called pseudorandom\nnumber generators.\n\n278\n00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.550\nSo PRNGs is what they're\noften referred to as.\n\n279\n00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:13.786\nWe use those for a variety of functions.\n\n280\n00:13:13.786 --> 00:13:17.029\nAnd so a Lagged Fibonacci\ngenerator is just a specific\n\n281\n00:13:17.029 --> 00:13:19.557\ntype of pseudorandom number generator.\n\n282\n00:13:19.557 --> 00:13:22.680\nJust what it is, so FISH is that.\n\n283\n00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.910\nPIKE, as I said, and as you pointed out,\nyes, pike is a type of fish.\n\n284\n00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:27.185\nCan't fault the logic there.\n\n285\n00:13:27.185 --> 00:13:29.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's like all water is wet.\n\n286\n00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:30.720\nSo that's good to know.\n\n287\n00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.377\nSo yes, PIKE improves-\n&gt;&gt; Aren't you glad I'm here for\n\n288\n00:13:33.377 --> 00:13:34.998\nthose wonderful nuggets of information?\n\n289\n00:13:34.998 --> 00:13:36.285\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna start calling them\n\n290\n00:13:36.285 --> 00:13:36.796\nCherokeeisms.\n\n291\n00:13:36.796 --> 00:13:38.450\nI think that's what\nwe're gonna brand them.\n\n292\n00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:41.117\nAnd we're gonna package them at\nthe end in the show notes so\n\n293\n00:13:41.117 --> 00:13:43.740\nyou could trace all\nthe Cherokeeisms per episode.\n\n294\n00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.680\nBut yes, PIKE is a kind of FISH.\n\n295\n00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.214\nAnd it is,\nas I also pointed out when you said it.\n\n296\n00:13:48.214 --> 00:13:49.550\nAnd it's a great way to think about it.\n\n297\n00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:50.724\nI like, actually, what you said about it.\n\n298\n00:13:50.724 --> 00:13:52.925\nBecause as I added to it,\nI said, as an aside,\n\n299\n00:13:52.925 --> 00:13:56.154\nyou're gonna see that PIKE is\nessentially an improvement on FISH.\n\n300\n00:13:56.154 --> 00:14:01.990\nBecause it adds some, or addresses a known\nvulnerability which is found in FISH.\n\n301\n00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:05.514\nAnd the issue with FISH is that it's\nvulnerable to what's known as or\n\n302\n00:14:05.514 --> 00:14:08.700\nwhat's referred to as\na known-plaintext attack.\n\n303\n00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.282\nWhich is a kind of\nattack in cryptanalysis.\n\n304\n00:14:11.282 --> 00:14:15.460\nCryptanalysis is the ability or\nthe study of how we break crypto systems.\n\n305\n00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:19.850\nSo it's used as an attack to be able to\nattack certain kinds of algorithms if\n\n306\n00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:21.370\nthey're implemented and they're weak.\n\n307\n00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:25.829\nAnd known-plaintext attacks,\nwe have the plaintext, the name implies.\n\n308\n00:14:25.829 --> 00:14:30.382\nAnd we can work the plaintext through the\nsystem in a series of backs and forths.\n\n309\n00:14:30.382 --> 00:14:34.572\nLooking at the plaintext and seeing the\nresulting ciphertext without knowing or\n\n310\n00:14:34.572 --> 00:14:36.130\nhaving knowledge of the key.\n\n311\n00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:38.854\nCuz remember, what we are looking for\n\n312\n00:14:38.854 --> 00:14:43.633\nbased on Kerckhoffs's principle\nis knowledge of, dare I say it?\n\n313\n00:14:43.633 --> 00:14:44.338\nDare I show it?\n\n314\n00:14:44.338 --> 00:14:45.550\nWait, that's the wrong one.\n\n315\n00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:46.595\nDare I say it or show it?\n\n316\n00:14:46.595 --> 00:14:48.600\nThe key, the gold key is the private key.\n\n317\n00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.520\nThe key, so-\n&gt;&gt; We've been switching.\n\n318\n00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.305\n&gt;&gt; Whatever we've been doing.\n\n319\n00:14:51.305 --> 00:14:52.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Whatever that is,\n\n320\n00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:53.460\nthat's the private key.\n\n321\n00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:55.920\nSo, as a result, what we're looking for\n\n322\n00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.650\nhere is we're probably gonna\nknow some of the plaintext.\n\n323\n00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:01.906\nWe're gonna be able to get and\nfigure out by working through the system.\n\n324\n00:15:01.906 --> 00:15:04.265\nCuz remember, what did Kerckhoffs say?\n\n325\n00:15:04.265 --> 00:15:06.286\nHey, give them the ciphertext.\n\n326\n00:15:06.286 --> 00:15:07.939\nGive them the algorithm.\n\n327\n00:15:07.939 --> 00:15:08.856\nTell them what you’re doing.\n\n328\n00:15:08.856 --> 00:15:10.500\nJust don’t give them the key.\n\n329\n00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.492\nSo if we know the plaintext,\nwe can work it through the algorithm.\n\n330\n00:15:13.492 --> 00:15:18.070\nSee the ciphertext, and we can begin to\nstart doing analysis of how that works.\n\n331\n00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:20.846\nThat’s how known-plaintext\nattacks work over time.\n\n332\n00:15:20.846 --> 00:15:22.905\nThen we may be able to guess the key and\nderive it.\n\n333\n00:15:22.905 --> 00:15:25.010\nAnd that’s what ultimately is\nthe outcome of that attack.\n\n334\n00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:29.227\nSo PIKE improves on FISH because\nFISH was found to be vulnerable to\n\n335\n00:15:29.227 --> 00:15:31.152\nknown-plaintext attacks.\n\n336\n00:15:31.152 --> 00:15:34.270\nPIKE improves on it, tightens it up,\nmakes it less vulnerable.\n\n337\n00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:36.032\nIt's published by a guy\nnamed Ross Anderson.\n\n338\n00:15:36.032 --> 00:15:39.640\nSo you can see who's behind that there,\njust so you know.\n\n339\n00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:44.021\nSo those are some examples\nof the stream ciphers.\n\n340\n00:15:44.021 --> 00:15:47.510\nHow we would implement symmetric\nencryption using a stream cipher.\n\n341\n00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:49.623\nWhat about hashing and hashing functions?\n\n342\n00:15:49.623 --> 00:15:53.000\nWe've actually been talking about\nhashing for six episodes now.\n\n343\n00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.311\nBut we haven't really gotten to it.\n\n344\n00:15:54.311 --> 00:15:58.962\nBut indeed, we actually did But we got to\nit when we went through and defined all\n\n345\n00:15:58.962 --> 00:16:03.680\nthe vocabulary, cuz we did talk about\nhashing in the vocabulary episodes.\n\n346\n00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.440\nWe spent actually a pretty significant\namount of time explaining how\n\n347\n00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.800\nhashing worked, we went through,\nwe talked about it.\n\n348\n00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.560\nWe're gonna want to take a look,\nnot right now, but wanna take a look,\n\n349\n00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.370\nremember at the picture we have for\nhashing.\n\n350\n00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:15.080\nWe talked about that, and\n\n351\n00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.520\nhopefully you will be able to\nshow that to us in just a minute.\n\n352\n00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.740\nIf you remember where we did the symmetric\nalgorithm picture with Bob and Alice,\n\n353\n00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:23.594\nwe had one there for hashing,\njust wanna bring that back up real quick.\n\n354\n00:16:23.594 --> 00:16:24.199\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n355\n00:16:24.199 --> 00:16:25.314\n&gt;&gt; So we'll go to that in just a second.\n\n356\n00:16:25.314 --> 00:16:26.021\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n357\n00:16:26.021 --> 00:16:28.634\n&gt;&gt; I'm just giving Cherokee a heads up cuz\nI don't want her to get caught off guard\n\n358\n00:16:28.634 --> 00:16:29.911\nwhen I say, hey, can we look at data.\n\n359\n00:16:29.911 --> 00:16:31.293\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; She's like, what?\n\n360\n00:16:31.293 --> 00:16:31.857\n&gt;&gt; I'm glad you reminded me.\n\n361\n00:16:31.857 --> 00:16:34.308\n&gt;&gt; I'm out there looking at it like\nsomething totally unrelated, right?\n\n362\n00:16:34.308 --> 00:16:37.320\nSo we're gonna take a look at that in just\na second, she'll get that ready for us.\n\n363\n00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.610\nBut on hashing,\njust to remind us first of what that is,\n\n364\n00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:43.230\none way mathematical operation,\nwe talked about this.\n\n365\n00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:48.440\nReducing a message or data into a smaller\nfixed size or fixed length output.\n\n366\n00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:54.190\nWe call that traditionally a hash value\nwhen we are digitally signing a message or\n\n367\n00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:55.770\na digitally signing software.\n\n368\n00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:57.560\nWe call that a digital signature,\n\n369\n00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.200\nit's called a message to\ndigest when we hash an email.\n\n370\n00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.430\nThere's different names we refer to it as,\nbut\n\n371\n00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:05.540\nultimately what we are saying\nis we're hashing something.\n\n372\n00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:09.400\nNow, I came up a with little formula when\nwe did our vocabulary view I shared with\n\n373\n00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.700\nyou, put it back here in the notes for\nyou again.\n\n374\n00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.800\nVariable data input of any size,\n\n375\n00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:17.580\nplus hashing algorithm, two examples of\nhashing algorithms were listed there.\n\n376\n00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:24.236\nMD5, SHA1, there are some others we'll\ntalk about in just a minute, right?\n\n377\n00:17:24.236 --> 00:17:27.790\nMD-160, SHA-256, SHA-512, SHA-348,\nthere's a whole series of them.\n\n378\n00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:31.440\nBut whatever that algorithm is that\ngives us the fixed bit stream output, or\n\n379\n00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.620\ncommonly called a hash value.\n\n380\n00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:35.680\nThe secret with hashing, remember,\n\n381\n00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.710\nis to understand that that\nfixed bit stream output,\n\n382\n00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:44.310\nthe hash value size is determined by\nthe hashing algorithm that is implemented.\n\n383\n00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:47.865\nSo MD5 will always give\nus a 128 bit hash value.\n\n384\n00:17:47.865 --> 00:17:53.056\nSHA-1 always gives us 160 bit output or\nhash value right?\n\n385\n00:17:53.056 --> 00:17:58.795\nThen D-160 always gives us\na 160 bit hash value, SHA-256,\n\n386\n00:17:58.795 --> 00:18:05.720\n256 bit hash value you get the idea,\nright, CRC32, 32-bit hash value.\n\n387\n00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.700\nAll of these algorithms that are used for\n\n388\n00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:11.310\nhashing are gonna have\na fixed output size.\n\n389\n00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:15.940\nBecause we're not gonna represent\nthe actual data cryptographically from\n\n390\n00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:21.450\nthe perspective of confidentiality with\na hash, with this particular approach.\n\n391\n00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:25.400\nBut rather, we are representing it\nfrom an integrity perspective and\n\n392\n00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.360\nwe've gone through and\n\n393\n00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:30.220\ntalked about the idea that this is\nlike change management for our data.\n\n394\n00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:33.500\nFrozen in a moment in time, so\nthat we can then go back and\n\n395\n00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:37.160\nrefer to the data and\nvalidity that we have integrity.\n\n396\n00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:41.420\nHas the data changed in any way\nsince we applied the hash to it?\n\n397\n00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:45.440\nAnd the hash value should be\nidentical if the data is the same.\n\n398\n00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.250\nBut we did this demonstration\nwhere we ran hash calc,\n\n399\n00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:51.970\nthe little calculator that\ncalculates the hash values for us.\n\n400\n00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:56.506\nAnd we saw that when we modified the data,\nthe dog is green period, right,\n\n401\n00:18:56.506 --> 00:19:00.043\nversus the dog is green that\nwe saw different hash values.\n\n402\n00:19:00.043 --> 00:19:04.948\nAnd we saw the impact of making even\nthe slightest change in the input value or\n\n403\n00:19:04.948 --> 00:19:06.260\nthe original data.\n\n404\n00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.500\nSo we went through all this and\nwe talked about this.\n\n405\n00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:13.470\nWhat we also wanna remind ourselves of,\nis the idea of salting the hash,\n\n406\n00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:17.470\nusing a salt value to apply to the hash.\n\n407\n00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:20.200\nThe random bits that are used is\none of the inputs for the hash.\n\n408\n00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.610\nThe salt is gonna be intermixed\nwith the data, the message, or\n\n409\n00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:25.360\nwhatever it is that's gonna be hashed.\n\n410\n00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.670\nAnd we use this to further confuse and\nobfuscate,\n\n411\n00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:31.760\nas we've often talked about,\nthe information.\n\n412\n00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:36.633\nNow keep in mind when we use a hash value\nto represent the integrity of the data and\n\n413\n00:19:36.633 --> 00:19:41.362\nwe salt the hash, we're making it even\nharder for somebody to figure out what\n\n414\n00:19:41.362 --> 00:19:45.117\nthat data is and to modify it\nwithout direct knowledge of it.\n\n415\n00:19:45.117 --> 00:19:48.161\nCuz they have to know not just the data,\nbut\n\n416\n00:19:48.161 --> 00:19:53.760\nthe salt value as well to be able to use\nthat value, that hash value correctly.\n\n417\n00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.510\nBecause the hash value is\ngonna be a derivative or\n\n418\n00:19:56.510 --> 00:20:01.570\nrepresentation of both the actual data,\nbut also the salt value.\n\n419\n00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:05.420\nAnd if we don't separate the two,\nthen there is no way for\n\n420\n00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:08.520\nus to know which is which or\nwhich portion of the hash value is which.\n\n421\n00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:12.500\nAnd if we don't have both,\nwe can't reproduce the hash string and\n\n422\n00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:15.090\ntherefore we don't have an accurate\nrepresentation of the data.\n\n423\n00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:18.659\nWhich is good when we use it for\nsomething like storing passwords, right?\n\n424\n00:20:18.659 --> 00:20:21.329\nCuz when we solve the hash\nof the user password, or\n\n425\n00:20:21.329 --> 00:20:25.460\nusername which is really where we\ntraditionally see this being done.\n\n426\n00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:30.210\nIn directory systems where\nwe store the credential,\n\n427\n00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:32.010\nright, username and a password.\n\n428\n00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:36.310\nWe store the hash value of that in\nthe directory service and the LDAP lookup.\n\n429\n00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:40.190\nWe don't actually send our username and\npassword across the wire.\n\n430\n00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:43.930\nWe send a cryptographic hash\nrepresentation of that data,\n\n431\n00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:45.850\nwe send the hash value.\n\n432\n00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:49.950\nAnd we do a lookup at the point of\ncomparison on the domain controller in\n\n433\n00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:53.780\nWindows or at the LDAP provider,\nwhatever that is in open LDAP.\n\n434\n00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:56.720\nWe send the hash value,\nwe do a lookup through a lookup table.\n\n435\n00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:01.170\nAnd we say Cherokee is the username,\npassword is Cherokee,\n\n436\n00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:03.400\nlet's just say, right,\nif that's what it was.\n\n437\n00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:07.950\nAnd what Cherokee would send when she\nsits down, types her information and\n\n438\n00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:12.450\nhits Enter,\nis a hash value of those two actual items.\n\n439\n00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:14.180\nShe doesn't really send the password.\n\n440\n00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:17.980\nPeople often don't understand this and\nget confused and say, well, my password is\n\n441\n00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.880\ngonna potentially be vulnerable to\nsomebody sniffing it on the wire.\n\n442\n00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:21.480\nNot at all,\n\n443\n00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:25.760\nwhat it's actually they're gonna\nsniff is the hash value that we sent.\n\n444\n00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:29.690\nAnd that's okay because remember,\nthe hash does not expose the password.\n\n445\n00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:34.085\nUnless, and we'll talk about\nwhat's listed there right up here,\n\n446\n00:21:34.085 --> 00:21:36.405\nwhich is why salting is so effective.\n\n447\n00:21:36.405 --> 00:21:38.665\nUnless they have what's\nknown as a rainbow table and\n\n448\n00:21:38.665 --> 00:21:40.365\nthey execute a rainbow table attack.\n\n449\n00:21:40.365 --> 00:21:43.275\nWe'll talk about where that fits\nin here in just a second, right?\n\n450\n00:21:43.275 --> 00:21:47.715\nBut the idea here is that when we\nsend that hash value over the wire,\n\n451\n00:21:47.715 --> 00:21:53.340\nwe're sending a one-way value that cannot\ntypically be reverse engineered easily.\n\n452\n00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:56.700\nThere is that but, if, conversation that\nalways occurs that’s where the rainbow\n\n453\n00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:00.700\ntables come in, but we’re sending that and\nwhat we’re doing is comparing that\n\n454\n00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.530\nagainst the known value\nstored in the lookup system.\n\n455\n00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:08.120\nIf Cherokee's username and\npassword hashed out with MD5 or SHA-1 or\n\n456\n00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:13.010\nwhatever, is represented properly and\nthe comparison says yeah,\n\n457\n00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:17.290\nABC123 equals what Cherokee said,\nthat's what we have on file.\n\n458\n00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:20.420\nThen we validate her request to log on,\nand we let her in.\n\n459\n00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:24.110\nIf she sends a hash that doesn't match\nthe look up, we don't validate her,\n\n460\n00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:25.170\nwe don't let her in.\n\n461\n00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:28.510\nThis is how the comparison is done for\nauthentication.\n\n462\n00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:31.990\nSo salting becomes important\nbecause what salting does\n\n463\n00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:34.020\nis it adds a layer of randomness in.\n\n464\n00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:37.270\nSo that, when we send the hash value and\n\n465\n00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:41.540\nthe bad actor, right, is there to\nsniff the wire and get the hash value.\n\n466\n00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:45.140\nAnd then they try to use that\nhash value to do the comparison.\n\n467\n00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:48.150\nIf they don't understand all\nthe information about it,\n\n468\n00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:51.220\nthey're not gonna actually be\nable to look it up and derive.\n\n469\n00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:53.880\nNot the hash value and\ntry to spoof the lookup, but\n\n470\n00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:57.100\nrather, try to guess the username and\npassword or whatever we're talking about.\n\n471\n00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:01.620\nIt's probably the password that they're\ntrying to guess, by not brute forcing, but\n\n472\n00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:04.480\nby doing kind of a little\nsleight of hand trick.\n\n473\n00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.840\nWhich is what's called\na rainbow table attack.\n\n474\n00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.920\nAnd this is where the interesting\nthing comes in about this,\n\n475\n00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:13.350\nbecause we can take hashes,\nand we can then look them up.\n\n476\n00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:16.690\nAnd if we have this thing called\nRainbow Table, which you can Google and\n\n477\n00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:20.730\neasily find out about, it's\na pre-compiled list of all the hashes for\n\n478\n00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:23.780\nspecific passwords or\ncombinations of input.\n\n479\n00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:25.930\nAnd somebody has gone to the trouble\nof pre-compiling all of these.\n\n480\n00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:30.740\nSo When you do a lookup for rainbow\ntables, you go to projectrainbowcrack.org,\n\n481\n00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:31.330\nI think it is, right?\n\n482\n00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:33.715\nIf I'm not mistaken, or\nrainbowcrack.org, one of the two,\n\n483\n00:23:33.715 --> 00:23:36.421\nwe'll do a lookup real quick while\nwe're taking a look at the picture.\n\n484\n00:23:36.421 --> 00:23:37.073\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n485\n00:23:37.073 --> 00:23:39.720\n&gt;&gt; You wanna show us and\nI'll bring that up so we can see it.\n\n486\n00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:43.247\nBut when you go out there, you'll see they\nhave all the pre-computed rainbow tables.\n\n487\n00:23:43.247 --> 00:23:45.439\nSome of these are almost\na terabyte in size,\n\n488\n00:23:45.439 --> 00:23:49.527\nbecause if you do 0 through 7 characters\nthen you add the 8th and 9th, 10th,\n\n489\n00:23:49.527 --> 00:23:51.799\nwhatever, they get exponentially bigger.\n\n490\n00:23:51.799 --> 00:23:55.397\nJust google rainbow tables and then\nyou’ll get like project rainbow table or\n\n491\n00:23:55.397 --> 00:23:56.959\nRainbow crack or whatever it is.\n\n492\n00:23:56.959 --> 00:23:59.002\nOne of the very first references,\nI always forget what it is.\n\n493\n00:23:59.002 --> 00:24:01.210\nBut you'll find it there,\nyou can actually go to the site.\n\n494\n00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:05.510\nSo the rainbow table attack lets\nus steal those hash values,\n\n495\n00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:07.890\nlook them up if we have\na pre computed table.\n\n496\n00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:12.669\nAnd if we find a match for the hash value,\nwe translate that in the password.\n\n497\n00:24:12.669 --> 00:24:17.520\nIt's how we essentially reverse engineer\nthe hash to get the password by snooping.\n\n498\n00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.160\nThis is called a rainbow table attack.\n\n499\n00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:22.580\nSalting prevents that from\nhappening because what salting does\n\n500\n00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:25.320\nis it adds randomness into the hash value.\n\n501\n00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:29.580\nSo the lookup tables have the word\nCherokee, the name Cherokee.\n\n502\n00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:33.933\nLet's say all the derivatives, uppercase,\nlowercase, Cherokee spelled with o's,\n\n503\n00:24:33.933 --> 00:24:35.710\nCherokee spelled with zeros.\n\n504\n00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:39.380\nAll those things will be hashed out and\nprecomputed in the rainbow table.\n\n505\n00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:42.290\nIf Cherokee used any of those\nderivatives as her password,\n\n506\n00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:46.580\nwe would find them with a standard rainbow\ntable attack and a standard look up.\n\n507\n00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:51.120\nBut if we salted the hash,\ndidn't just use Cherokee's password,\n\n508\n00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:56.360\nspell Cherokee, let's say with one o and\none zero or whatever.\n\n509\n00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:59.720\nBut instead, or three's for\nthe e or whatever it would be.\n\n510\n00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.757\nBut if we added something else in,\nthat only Cherokee knew, and\n\n511\n00:25:02.757 --> 00:25:06.585\nthe person who computed the rainbow table\ndid not take into account the hash value\n\n512\n00:25:06.585 --> 00:25:07.953\nis not going to be looked up.\n\n513\n00:25:07.953 --> 00:25:10.654\nIt's not going to match,\nbecause now it's randomized and\n\n514\n00:25:10.654 --> 00:25:12.800\nit will not be able to be cracked easily.\n\n515\n00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:16.202\nSo this increases exponentially\nthe complexity of being able to\n\n516\n00:25:16.202 --> 00:25:19.226\nreverse engineer the hashes and\nbeing able to find them.\n\n517\n00:25:19.226 --> 00:25:20.686\nSo that's why salting is so important.\n\n518\n00:25:20.686 --> 00:25:23.417\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if we have time for this-\n&gt;&gt; Of course, we do.\n\n519\n00:25:23.417 --> 00:25:24.107\n&gt;&gt; But I was going to ask.\n\n520\n00:25:24.107 --> 00:25:26.429\nOkay, if we look at my screen here for-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n521\n00:25:26.429 --> 00:25:30.169\n&gt;&gt; A second,\ntell me how this relates, okay?\n\n522\n00:25:30.169 --> 00:25:34.302\nThis is how my mind, you already\nknow it's a little strange here.\n\n523\n00:25:34.302 --> 00:25:37.170\nBut if I take that sentence\nthat you had given us.\n\n524\n00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:39.709\n&gt;&gt; So just before you do that, just pull\nthat notepad down for half a second.\n\n525\n00:25:39.709 --> 00:25:40.543\n&gt;&gt; So they can see that?\nYeah.\n\n526\n00:25:40.543 --> 00:25:41.766\n&gt;&gt; Well let's just show people what we\n\n527\n00:25:41.766 --> 00:25:43.690\nwere talking about before we\nget into the explanation.\n\n528\n00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:45.442\nSo what I wanted to make sure-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n529\n00:25:45.442 --> 00:25:46.027\n&gt;&gt; Everybody sees cuz you went\n\n530\n00:25:46.027 --> 00:25:46.744\nto the trouble of bringing it up.\n\n531\n00:25:46.744 --> 00:25:48.792\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I just wanna make sure they know it,\n\n532\n00:25:48.792 --> 00:25:51.130\nis that this is one of\nthe sites I was talking about.\n\n533\n00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:52.547\nIt's not the only one, there's many,\n\n534\n00:25:52.547 --> 00:25:54.264\nmany sites out there to\nget rainbow tables from.\n\n535\n00:25:54.264 --> 00:25:58.656\nBut this is one I often send my students\nto, ProjectRainbowCrack.com, you could see\n\n536\n00:25:58.656 --> 00:26:02.400\nthe precomputed rainbow tables for\nthe NTLM, the LM, the MD5, right?\n\n537\n00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:06.540\nAnd you could see how big some of\nthem are, if you maybe go there.\n\n538\n00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:13.355\nLet me see for MD5, you could see that,\nno yeah, that's fine, just zoom over.\n\n539\n00:26:13.355 --> 00:26:16.326\nSo you can see for like 1 to 7,\n1 to 8, and 1 to 9,\n\n540\n00:26:16.326 --> 00:26:18.192\nhow big the key space is, right?\n\n541\n00:26:18.192 --> 00:26:21.415\nAnd the success rate, almost 100% success.\n\n542\n00:26:21.415 --> 00:26:25.652\nAnd you can see that depending on\nthe size, 1 to 8 is 460 gigs, right?\n\n543\n00:26:25.652 --> 00:26:29.010\nSo it's roughly half a terabyte in size,\nto be able to get that rainbow,\n\n544\n00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:30.630\nto be able to download that.\n\n545\n00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:34.629\nYou'd load that into a software cracking\nprogram, like PW Dom, PW Dom 2,\n\n546\n00:26:34.629 --> 00:26:39.207\nJohn the Ripper, L0phtCrack, Ophcrack,\nthere's all these different programs.\n\n547\n00:26:39.207 --> 00:26:43.869\nWhatever you would use, you load that\nin and execute the rainbow table attack\n\n548\n00:26:43.869 --> 00:26:48.245\nagainst the hashes that you are snooping\nfrom something like Ethereal,\n\n549\n00:26:48.245 --> 00:26:50.760\nperhaps Wireshark into a reversion.\n\n550\n00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.284\nMaybe use Cain &amp; Abel if\nit was a wireless network.\n\n551\n00:26:53.284 --> 00:26:55.598\nThere's are all different\nhacking tools you would use, but\n\n552\n00:26:55.598 --> 00:26:57.470\nyou would load it in and do the attack.\n\n553\n00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:59.204\nSo this is where you can\nactually download rainbow tables.\n\n554\n00:26:59.204 --> 00:27:03.490\nThe reason I recommend a site like\nthis is that this one's legitimate.\n\n555\n00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:05.212\nYou're not downloading malware or\n\n556\n00:27:05.212 --> 00:27:07.744\nanything in the guise as\na trojan of a rainbow table.\n\n557\n00:27:07.744 --> 00:27:09.897\nCuz you gotta be careful when you\ngo out to look for this stuff.\n\n558\n00:27:09.897 --> 00:27:12.420\nIf you don't know the site and\nyou're not sure it's legitimate-\n\n559\n00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:13.934\n&gt;&gt; You may end up blowing something up.\n\n560\n00:27:13.934 --> 00:27:14.651\n&gt;&gt; You may be downloading this.\n\n561\n00:27:14.651 --> 00:27:15.287\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n562\n00:27:15.287 --> 00:27:18.710\nyou may actually wind up blowing your\nmachine up with malware or who knows what.\n\n563\n00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:20.749\nSo this site is safe,\nyou can trust the site.\n\n564\n00:27:20.749 --> 00:27:23.952\nIt's why I often recommend it, I talk\nabout it, and I tell my students about it,\n\n565\n00:27:23.952 --> 00:27:25.330\nI'm telling you about it as well.\n\n566\n00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:27.215\nSo all right, so\nwe've just established that.\n\n567\n00:27:27.215 --> 00:27:28.704\nWe'll put the URL in the show notes so\nyou have it.\n\n568\n00:27:28.704 --> 00:27:32.230\nSo now, let's go through what you\nwanted to talk about it real quick.\n\n569\n00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:35.090\n&gt;&gt; So essentially, what those rainbow\ntables are doing, they're looking for\n\n570\n00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:35.752\nthat collision.\n\n571\n00:27:35.752 --> 00:27:40.252\nSo if we have that sentence\nthat you gave us, the dog or\n\n572\n00:27:40.252 --> 00:27:44.290\nnot dog, the dog is green, all right?\n\n573\n00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:48.891\nAnd you had a period there, let me try to\nzoom in, so that you guys can see that.\n\n574\n00:27:48.891 --> 00:27:49.448\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n575\n00:27:49.448 --> 00:27:54.782\n&gt;&gt; Sorry my fingers are on\nthe touch screen here, must be.\n\n576\n00:27:57.218 --> 00:27:58.396\nSorry.\n&gt;&gt; Just make the font bigger.\n\n577\n00:27:58.396 --> 00:27:58.978\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n578\n00:27:58.978 --> 00:28:00.127\n&gt;&gt; Making the font bigger-\n&gt;&gt; Hello.\n\n579\n00:28:00.127 --> 00:28:00.972\n&gt;&gt; Will be easier than zooming in.\n\n580\n00:28:00.972 --> 00:28:04.971\nAnd it will just stay big for the thing,\nso just do like 16 or 18 point and\n\n581\n00:28:04.971 --> 00:28:06.072\nwe'll able to see.\n\n582\n00:28:06.072 --> 00:28:08.357\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n583\n00:28:08.357 --> 00:28:09.595\n&gt;&gt; Because now we can see it no trouble.\n\n584\n00:28:09.595 --> 00:28:10.499\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, it's good.\n\n585\n00:28:10.499 --> 00:28:11.506\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good.\n\n586\n00:28:11.506 --> 00:28:16.289\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so if we say the dog is green,\nand let's just say I counted every single\n\n587\n00:28:16.289 --> 00:28:21.083\ncharacter including space in that period,\nwhich gives me 17 characters.\n\n588\n00:28:21.083 --> 00:28:23.720\nAnd we'll stick with our theme\nof fish since we've been kind of\n\n589\n00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:24.580\njoking about that.\n\n590\n00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:26.690\nSo funny fish, clown fish, all right?\n\n591\n00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:30.130\nAnd say, I came up with an algorithm,\na clown fish algorithm.\n\n592\n00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:35.311\nVery basic cuz it's a joke and we have\ncharacters times the number of words.\n\n593\n00:28:35.311 --> 00:28:36.815\nThe dog is green which is 4.\n\n594\n00:28:36.815 --> 00:28:39.190\n&gt;&gt; Times 17 characters.\n\n595\n00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:40.188\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so 4 times 17.\n\n596\n00:28:40.188 --> 00:28:41.587\n&gt;&gt; So 68, right, okay.\n\n597\n00:28:41.587 --> 00:28:42.387\n&gt;&gt; Good job.\n\n598\n00:28:42.387 --> 00:28:42.981\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n599\n00:28:42.981 --> 00:28:48.196\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but now if we change this to cat-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n600\n00:28:48.196 --> 00:28:52.038\n&gt;&gt; And we apply that same clown\nfish algorithm, and my hash value.\n\n601\n00:28:52.038 --> 00:28:53.015\n&gt;&gt; Same number of characters.\n\n602\n00:28:53.015 --> 00:28:54.462\n&gt;&gt; Same number of characters.\n\n603\n00:28:54.462 --> 00:28:57.679\n&gt;&gt; Same number of words-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n604\n00:28:57.679 --> 00:28:58.631\n&gt;&gt; So you still have 68.\n\n605\n00:28:58.631 --> 00:28:59.874\n&gt;&gt; So it's a week algorithm?\n\n606\n00:28:59.874 --> 00:29:04.955\n&gt;&gt; Well so\nwhat are we trying to establish?\n\n607\n00:29:04.955 --> 00:29:06.974\nSo your telling me a story, but\nI don't know where we're going.\n\n608\n00:29:06.974 --> 00:29:08.327\nSo I'm not sure whether it's weak or not.\n\n609\n00:29:08.327 --> 00:29:09.413\n&gt;&gt; I'm getting the same hash value.\n\n610\n00:29:09.413 --> 00:29:11.045\nSo that's my hash collision.\n\n611\n00:29:11.045 --> 00:29:12.218\n&gt;&gt; No your not getting\nthe same hash value.\n\n612\n00:29:12.218 --> 00:29:19.375\nBecause the hash would be different,\nbecause you changed dog for cat.\n\n613\n00:29:19.375 --> 00:29:23.578\nSo in other words, the input value is\ndifferent so the hash output is different.\n\n614\n00:29:23.578 --> 00:29:26.798\nUnless your changing the rules for\nyour clown fish algorithm.\n\n615\n00:29:26.798 --> 00:29:27.342\n&gt;&gt; For my clown fish.\n\n616\n00:29:27.342 --> 00:29:27.951\n&gt;&gt; Algorithm.\n\n617\n00:29:27.951 --> 00:29:29.306\n&gt;&gt; I was falling that\nparticular algorithm.\n\n618\n00:29:29.306 --> 00:29:31.470\n&gt;&gt; So instead of being based on the input,\n\n619\n00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:35.339\nbecause remember what the hash value\nis derived from and ultimately is\n\n620\n00:29:35.339 --> 00:29:39.610\ngenerated based on any hash value,\nregardless of what algorithm we use.\n\n621\n00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:40.500\nThis is universal,\n\n622\n00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:45.580\nso unless we fundamentally alter the way\nhashes work is what I'm suggesting to you.\n\n623\n00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:48.937\nThe way hashing works,\nregardless of algorithm,\n\n624\n00:29:48.937 --> 00:29:53.540\nis not that we would variable or\nwe would, not that we would pivot on and\n\n625\n00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:56.600\ntherefore change based\non the number of bits.\n\n626\n00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.512\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But rather we pivot and\n\n627\n00:29:58.512 --> 00:30:02.709\nchange based on the input of\nthe string that we are hashing.\n\n628\n00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:06.340\nOr in the case of the file,\nthe size of the file and\n\n629\n00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:08.730\nthe unique variable\nidentifiers of the file.\n\n630\n00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:12.284\nIf it's a hexadecimal input,\nit's the actual hex string A through F,\n\n631\n00:30:12.284 --> 00:30:13.479\n0 through 9, right?\n\n632\n00:30:13.479 --> 00:30:13.992\nThat kind of thing.\n\n633\n00:30:13.992 --> 00:30:15.243\nSo it's the input in other words.\n\n634\n00:30:15.243 --> 00:30:17.650\nThe point is generically, it's the input.\n\n635\n00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:21.152\nNow if you wanna save this, for\npurposes of our conversation,\n\n636\n00:30:21.152 --> 00:30:23.411\nthat the clown fish hashing algorithm.\n\n637\n00:30:23.411 --> 00:30:29.982\nThe input that it will use to establish\nthe hash value will be the number of bits.\n\n638\n00:30:29.982 --> 00:30:34.594\nBits being derived from the total\nnumber of characters times,\n\n639\n00:30:34.594 --> 00:30:37.800\nas you suggested, the number of words.\n\n640\n00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:43.078\nAnd that we will use the number of bits\nto drive the input value for the hash.\n\n641\n00:30:43.078 --> 00:30:46.625\nIf that's what you want to establish or\nwhat you want to talk about,\n\n642\n00:30:46.625 --> 00:30:49.750\nthen we can kind of make the hash\nwork the way it always does.\n\n643\n00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:52.463\nWe're not violating\nthe rules of cryptography.\n\n644\n00:30:52.463 --> 00:30:55.344\nWe're not gonna violate the laws of\nphysics or do anything bad like that.\n\n645\n00:30:55.344 --> 00:30:57.579\nCross the streams, any of that-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n646\n00:30:57.579 --> 00:30:58.342\n&gt;&gt; Crazy kind of stuff, in other words\n\n647\n00:30:58.342 --> 00:30:58.880\na terrible thing to say.\n\n648\n00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.335\n&gt;&gt; Tear a hole in the time, yeah.\n\n649\n00:31:01.335 --> 00:31:01.991\n&gt;&gt; Terrible outcomes, right?\n\n650\n00:31:01.991 --> 00:31:02.772\nSo we want to avoid that at all costs.\n\n651\n00:31:02.772 --> 00:31:04.534\nRemember what they said in Ghostbusters.\n\n652\n00:31:04.534 --> 00:31:08.440\nRemember, Egon said,\nnever cross the streams, right?\n\n653\n00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:13.136\nSo we're not gonna do that, but if you're\ngonna stipulate that that will become\n\n654\n00:31:13.136 --> 00:31:17.848\nthe value that we use for input to create\nthe hash value, as you were suggesting.\n\n655\n00:31:17.848 --> 00:31:20.670\nThen if we're clear about that, then yes,\n\n656\n00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:26.390\nwe could say that because although we're\nmodifying dog for cat and we're changing.\n\n657\n00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:30.823\nBut since we're gonna hash value\nbased on the number of bits defined\n\n658\n00:31:30.823 --> 00:31:33.633\nby number words times actual characters.\n\n659\n00:31:33.633 --> 00:31:38.169\nThat it is gonna derive the same hash\nvalue whether it says the dog is green or\n\n660\n00:31:38.169 --> 00:31:40.195\nthe cat is green period, right?\n\n661\n00:31:40.195 --> 00:31:41.946\nBecause we have 17-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n662\n00:31:41.946 --> 00:31:43.729\n&gt;&gt; Total characters time 4 words.\n\n663\n00:31:43.729 --> 00:31:44.262\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n664\n00:31:44.262 --> 00:31:47.788\n&gt;&gt; So the hash value will be same for\nboth those statements.\n\n665\n00:31:47.788 --> 00:31:50.794\nThat doesn't indicate that\nthe algorithm is weak,\n\n666\n00:31:50.794 --> 00:31:55.729\nit just indicates that it would generate\nthe same hash value, creating a collision.\n\n667\n00:31:55.729 --> 00:32:01.430\nWhich could indicate that it is more\nsusceptible to certain kinds of attacks.\n\n668\n00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:02.770\nIt may or may not be weak.\n\n669\n00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:08.510\nIt's just, I don't wanna jump to\nthe end result conclusion that given\n\n670\n00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:13.120\nthe manipulation you ask us to engage\nin to create the clown fish algorithm.\n\n671\n00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:16.480\nAnd big disclaimer here, there is no\nsuch thing as the clown fish algorithm.\n\n672\n00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.460\nAt the time we are talking about this and\nactually putting it down for\n\n673\n00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:20.850\nyou to watch, right?\n\n674\n00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:22.100\nThere may be one in the future.\n\n675\n00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:25.950\nI don't know, and if there is, well,\nbut right now there's no such thing as\n\n676\n00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:29.160\nthe clown fish algorithm here today,\nright as we're talking about this.\n\n677\n00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:32.860\nThis is merely just an exercise\nin just theorizing that\n\n678\n00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:34.730\nCherokee's asking us to engage in,\nreally quickly.\n\n679\n00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:39.610\nBut, if we did that, and, which is fine,\nwe could do that, yeah in that parameter.\n\n680\n00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:43.180\nIn that particular little small example.\n\n681\n00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:47.690\nIt would probably be weak, because it\nis generating the same hash value.\n\n682\n00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:50.740\nBut remember, the key criteria is that\n\n683\n00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:55.440\ndifferent inputs generate the same\noutputs, create a collision.\n\n684\n00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.031\nWe're not meeting that criteria.\n\n685\n00:32:57.031 --> 00:32:58.680\nWe're only meeting half of it.\n\n686\n00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.040\nWe're generating the same output.\n\n687\n00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:05.320\nBut essentially, right, the same\noutput is coming from the same input.\n\n688\n00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:07.110\nBecause it's 68 bits.\n\n689\n00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:09.580\nWe didn't specify different bits.\n\n690\n00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:13.412\nWe didn't specify that it could\nbe anything other than you said,\n\n691\n00:33:13.412 --> 00:33:14.660\nwell it's gonna be 68 bits.\n\n692\n00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:15.850\nIt's still 68 bits,\n\n693\n00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:19.570\neven though the deriving of those\nbits is done from different inputs.\n\n694\n00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:24.160\nYou didn't tell us if the input derivation\nfunction had to be different or\n\n695\n00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.940\nthe same to meet the criteria.\n\n696\n00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:29.815\nSo the only reason I'm saying,\nit's an interesting exercise.\n\n697\n00:33:29.815 --> 00:33:33.193\nBut we'd have to develop more logic\non how we create the algorithm-\n\n698\n00:33:33.193 --> 00:33:34.357\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm just trying to break\n\n699\n00:33:34.357 --> 00:33:36.152\nit down and\nkind of relate it to rainbow tables.\n\n700\n00:33:36.152 --> 00:33:39.909\nBecause some of us might maybe wanna\nunderstand the underworkings here.\n\n701\n00:33:39.909 --> 00:33:42.105\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let me give you\na better way of thinking about this.\n\n702\n00:33:42.105 --> 00:33:43.815\nSo the better way to\nthink about it would be\n\n703\n00:33:43.815 --> 00:33:45.505\nsomething that happened a few years ago.\n\n704\n00:33:45.505 --> 00:33:48.705\nWhich is, if you remember, LinkedIn,\nyou all probably know about LinkedIn.\n\n705\n00:33:48.705 --> 00:33:49.935\nI'm sure you do, as well.\n\n706\n00:33:49.935 --> 00:33:51.400\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; LinkedIn was hacked.\n\n707\n00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:55.981\nAnd the people that hacked LinkedIn dumped\nthe hash cables of all of the stored\n\n708\n00:33:55.981 --> 00:33:59.949\nusername and password combinations\nfrom the LinkedIn database.\n\n709\n00:33:59.949 --> 00:34:01.646\nThey got them,\nthey posted them on the Internet.\n\n710\n00:34:01.646 --> 00:34:03.220\nThis was a big deal.\n\n711\n00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:06.450\nThis happened about, I don't know, six,\nseven years ago, whatever it was now.\n\n712\n00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:09.650\nAnd at the time, and anytime,\nthis was a huge issue.\n\n713\n00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:13.085\nAnd so when this occurred people\nwere concerned because essentially\n\n714\n00:34:13.085 --> 00:34:17.298\ntheir user names and passwords had been\nmade public, not really, but they worked.\n\n715\n00:34:17.298 --> 00:34:18.184\n&gt;&gt; Not ClearTech's, but-\n&gt;&gt; Right and\n\n716\n00:34:18.184 --> 00:34:21.346\nso the better way to think about what\nyou asked us to go through right now\n\n717\n00:34:21.346 --> 00:34:23.770\nwith the cloud fish algorithm\nwould be this example.\n\n718\n00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:29.660\nWhich is when they dumped the hash\ndatabase from LinkedIn on the Internet.\n\n719\n00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:31.530\nYou could go out and\n\n720\n00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:36.010\ntake somebody's potential username or\npassword combination.\n\n721\n00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:40.610\nAnd if you have the hash you could\ncompare it to the known database.\n\n722\n00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:44.350\nAnd if you got a match you could then,\nthrough the lookup,\n\n723\n00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:46.570\nunderstand what their user name and\npassword was.\n\n724\n00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:50.490\nBecause essentially, they created\na rainbow table out of the username and\n\n725\n00:34:50.490 --> 00:34:53.160\npassword database and\nallowed you to do the lookup.\n\n726\n00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:57.521\nNow I think I've told this story in other,\nnot in these episodes but in other shows,\n\n727\n00:34:57.521 --> 00:34:59.435\nat some point I've told this story.\n\n728\n00:34:59.435 --> 00:35:03.190\nBut I was actually, you know timing is\neverything in this business, right?\n\n729\n00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:07.606\nSo I was in New York, I was gonna be\nspeaking at a security conference the next\n\n730\n00:35:07.606 --> 00:35:10.370\nmorning when this attack\noccurred overnight.\n\n731\n00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:13.168\nAnd it happened late at night, it was\nmade public around two in the morning or\n\n732\n00:35:13.168 --> 00:35:14.710\nsomething crazy like that.\n\n733\n00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:17.500\nSo not everybody knew about it first thing\nin the morning the following morning.\n\n734\n00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.940\nI happened to be up late working on\nmy presentation to get ready to speak\n\n735\n00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:24.530\nthe next day, and I saw this come\nover the wire, heard about this.\n\n736\n00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:28.506\nWhen I downloaded the database,\nand this is awesome.\n\n737\n00:35:28.506 --> 00:35:30.438\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; How could I ask for\n\n738\n00:35:30.438 --> 00:35:33.214\nsomething better than talking about this.\n\n739\n00:35:33.214 --> 00:35:37.454\nBecause I was speaking on something\nhaving to do with security awareness,\n\n740\n00:35:37.454 --> 00:35:41.442\nhow you have to do all this stuff and\njust corporate security culture.\n\n741\n00:35:41.442 --> 00:35:44.639\nKind of standard thought process you\nwould give in like a keynote speech,\n\n742\n00:35:44.639 --> 00:35:47.170\nsomething along those lines,\nhigh level, right?\n\n743\n00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:48.580\nAnd, so I was gonna do my whole thing.\n\n744\n00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:52.882\nI had a little Ted Talk thing set up and\nthe 10, 15 minute thing, and\n\n745\n00:35:52.882 --> 00:35:55.360\nthe five impactful slides and all that.\n\n746\n00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.260\nAnd then I said,\nthis is too good to pass up.\n\n747\n00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:00.690\nSo, because I knew everybody in\nthe audience the next morning\n\n748\n00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:02.200\nwas gonna start asking about this anyway.\n\n749\n00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.100\nI might as well beat them to the punch.\n\n750\n00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:06.540\nSo I went up, did my quick intro,\n\n751\n00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:10.270\nand said, hey, forget about all this\ncool stuff I was gonna talk about.\n\n752\n00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:11.800\nYou guys really wanna talk about this.\n\n753\n00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:14.556\nIf you don't know about this,\nthis is even more important.\n\n754\n00:36:14.556 --> 00:36:19.280\nAnd so I brought up the database and\nI said okay, great who wants to go first?\n\n755\n00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:20.023\nLets put this in a test.\n\n756\n00:36:20.023 --> 00:36:25.061\nLet me teach you practically here right\nnow in the real time how hashing,\n\n757\n00:36:25.061 --> 00:36:28.869\nhow rainbow tables,\nhow rainbow crack attacks work.\n\n758\n00:36:28.869 --> 00:36:31.720\nAnd why it's important to change\nyour passwords on a regular basis.\n\n759\n00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:34.440\nLets put this knowledge to practical use,\nin other words.\n\n760\n00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:37.410\nAnd I walked people in the audience\nup on the stage and I said okay,\n\n761\n00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:39.463\ndo you think you're on this list,\nyes or no.\n\n762\n00:36:39.463 --> 00:36:41.940\nI bet you I can tell you what\nyour user name and password is.\n\n763\n00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:42.540\nYou can't do that.\n\n764\n00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:46.510\nI said watch, and I said you don't tell me\nwhat your user name and password is, you\n\n765\n00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:50.560\njust tell me if you're, when we go through\nthis whole process if you're in there.\n\n766\n00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:53.310\nAnd so we went through, and\nwe did the whole thing.\n\n767\n00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:54.562\nAnd I showed them and said is that you?\n\n768\n00:36:54.562 --> 00:36:55.812\nGod that's me,I've gotta go change.\n\n769\n00:36:55.812 --> 00:37:01.250\nAnd we did this five or six times to show\neverybody how this works and that was it.\n\n770\n00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:03.470\nI spent the next hour and\na half free consulting for\n\n771\n00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:06.040\neverybody showing them that they\nhad to change their password.\n\n772\n00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:09.521\nBut it was a great opportunity to show\npeople how this all comes together.\n\n773\n00:37:09.521 --> 00:37:14.153\nSo if you wanna think about a practical,\nreal world demonstration of a rainbow\n\n774\n00:37:14.153 --> 00:37:18.801\ntable and a rainbow crack attack, go back\nand read up on the Linked In scandal.\n\n775\n00:37:18.801 --> 00:37:21.759\nWhat happened with them when they\nwere broken into and all this made,\n\n776\n00:37:21.759 --> 00:37:22.790\nwas made public.\n\n777\n00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:24.500\nThat's the exact kind of\nexample you're looking for.\n\n778\n00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:26.760\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n&gt;&gt; Because that's exactly what happened.\n\n779\n00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.440\nThat was the outcome of that,\n\n780\n00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:31.220\nwas that all this stuff got\ndumped out on the open internet.\n\n781\n00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:34.350\nOr if not,\nyou can talked to Miss Cherokee offline.\n\n782\n00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:37.903\nAnd you guys can work on creating\nthe blow fish, two fish, red fish,\n\n783\n00:37:37.903 --> 00:37:39.637\nclown fish algorithm together.\n\n784\n00:37:39.637 --> 00:37:41.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that will be the new name for\n\n785\n00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:42.040\nthe algorithm.\n\n786\n00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:45.120\nSo I know for\na fact that one does not exist.\n\n787\n00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:48.060\nAll right, so we have,\nnot only exceeded our time value.\n\n788\n00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:50.110\nBut have hopefully told you\nsome really interesting and\n\n789\n00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:51.760\nexciting stories along the way.\n\n790\n00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:54.854\nBut salting the hash,\njust to return back to that as we wrap up.\n\n791\n00:37:54.854 --> 00:37:58.551\nReally important concept, very important\nfor you to understand the impact\n\n792\n00:37:58.551 --> 00:38:02.570\nof this so we don't get it right and\nto know that we have to implement salting.\n\n793\n00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:06.290\nRemember it may be turned on automatically\nbut it may be something you have to\n\n794\n00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:10.011\nimplement as part of the security\naround storing those hashes, right,\n\n795\n00:38:10.011 --> 00:38:13.490\nin such a way that they are not gonna be\nsubjected to these look up attacks or\n\n796\n00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:14.670\nrainbow table attacks easily.\n\n797\n00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:17.430\nIt's gonna be an extra added\nvalue protection we wanna\n\n798\n00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:19.020\nadd on there if at all possible.\n\n799\n00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:19.800\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n800\n00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.325\nWell, we have covered\na lot of information.\n\n801\n00:38:21.325 --> 00:38:24.130\nHopefully, you guys,\nwe've sparked some interest there.\n\n802\n00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:27.077\nAnd you're thinking as much as I\nam now after this conversation.\n\n803\n00:38:27.077 --> 00:38:30.689\n&gt;&gt; Can we do, I meant to say before we\nwrapped up, is what I meant to say.\n\n804\n00:38:30.689 --> 00:38:33.647\n&gt;&gt; So if you, this is almost\nlike the Marvel movies where\n\n805\n00:38:33.647 --> 00:38:35.695\nyou know if you go see-\n&gt;&gt; At the end?\n\n806\n00:38:35.695 --> 00:38:39.418\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Dr. Strange or something and then\nat the end they have the cool trailer for\n\n807\n00:38:39.418 --> 00:38:40.141\nthe new movie.\n\n808\n00:38:40.141 --> 00:38:41.372\nBut if you got up and left you missed it.\n\n809\n00:38:41.372 --> 00:38:41.901\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n810\n00:38:41.901 --> 00:38:43.482\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we should do that.\n\n811\n00:38:43.482 --> 00:38:46.107\nWe should pretend we're leaving and\nthen, so we'll kind of walk off,\n\n812\n00:38:46.107 --> 00:38:47.082\npretend we're leaving.\n\n813\n00:38:47.082 --> 00:38:47.832\nWe're gonna come back.\n\n814\n00:38:47.832 --> 00:38:49.990\nAnd now we're gonna do the coolest\npart of the whole thing.\n\n815\n00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:52.105\nWe've got three additional,\nreally quick actually, it's four,\n\n816\n00:38:52.105 --> 00:38:54.562\nreally quick additional little items I\nwanna throw in there if you don't care.\n\n817\n00:38:54.562 --> 00:38:55.335\n&gt;&gt; Let's do it.\n&gt;&gt; Because, otherwise,\n\n818\n00:38:55.335 --> 00:38:56.765\nwe're gonna come back and\ndo a two minute episode.\n\n819\n00:38:56.765 --> 00:38:59.022\nAnd that's just gonna be crazy.\n\n820\n00:38:59.022 --> 00:39:02.093\nSo I just want to throw a couple of\nquick additional hashing algorithms out\n\n821\n00:39:02.093 --> 00:39:02.962\nthere for you.\n\n822\n00:39:02.962 --> 00:39:05.950\nJust so you can know what they are in\ncase you come across them and see them.\n\n823\n00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:08.390\nCan we just put my document back up for\njust a minute?\n\n824\n00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:09.170\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n825\n00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:12.130\nAnd can we do full screen only,\ncuz I can't scroll down any further so\n\n826\n00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:12.980\nyou won't be able to see it.\n\n827\n00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:15.130\nThank you very much,\nthat's bad planning on my part.\n\n828\n00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:18.095\nSo, you can see there are four\nadditional hashing algorithms.\n\n829\n00:39:18.095 --> 00:39:19.043\nFORK-256.\n\n830\n00:39:19.043 --> 00:39:22.580\nSo, what do you think the output on\nthe hash value would be for FORK-256?\n\n831\n00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:24.245\n&gt;&gt; 256.\n&gt;&gt; 256, there you go.\n\n832\n00:39:24.245 --> 00:39:27.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; RIPEMD-160, we talked about that.\n\n833\n00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:31.699\nRIPEMD stands for race integrity\nprimitives evaluation message digest.\n\n834\n00:39:31.699 --> 00:39:33.191\n&gt;&gt; Whooh.\n&gt;&gt; Say that three times fast, right?\n\n835\n00:39:33.191 --> 00:39:37.805\nSo it was developed by Hans Dobbertin,\nAntoon Bosselaers,\n\n836\n00:39:37.805 --> 00:39:40.251\nI believe, and Brett Preneel.\n\n837\n00:39:40.251 --> 00:39:45.210\nAnd the output value there,\nwe already talked about the 160 bits.\n\n838\n00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:48.585\nGOST, or GOST,\nyou often hear it referred to as GOST.\n\n839\n00:39:48.585 --> 00:39:52.980\nMispronounced as GOST but its Russian,\nso it's pronounced GOST or GOST.\n\n840\n00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:59.890\nDefined actually the Russian\nnational standard R34.11-94 as in\n\n841\n00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:04.190\nNovember of 1994, information technology\ncryptographic information security.\n\n842\n00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:05.584\nHash function was the formal name,\n\n843\n00:40:05.584 --> 00:40:07.633\nif you could say that in\nRussian you're ahead of me.\n\n844\n00:40:07.633 --> 00:40:08.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n845\n00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:11.470\nthe size of the output there is 256 bits.\n\n846\n00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:15.629\nAnd TIGER, which is one a lot of people\ndo hear about, designed by Ross Anderson,\n\n847\n00:40:15.629 --> 00:40:17.391\nas in the Ross Anderson from Pike.\n\n848\n00:40:17.391 --> 00:40:23.309\nSame Ross Anderson, but\nit's a Ross Anderson, and Eli Biham.\n\n849\n00:40:23.309 --> 00:40:27.062\nEli Biham was also involved with Serpent,\nI believe, right?\n\n850\n00:40:27.062 --> 00:40:28.280\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yes.\n&gt;&gt; If I'm not mistaken, with Schneider.\n\n851\n00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:29.740\nHe was one of the people there, in 1995.\n\n852\n00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:31.790\nTIGER is gonna output 192 bits.\n\n853\n00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:36.040\nSo I just wanted to throw this additional\nhashing algorithms out there for us.\n\n854\n00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:39.204\nSo we can wrap up on a high note,\nobviously with hashing.\n\n855\n00:40:39.204 --> 00:40:43.513\nBut also make sure we wrap up fully and\nformally all of our thought processes and\n\n856\n00:40:43.513 --> 00:40:46.940\nconversations around\nsymmetric cryptography.\n\n857\n00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:50.020\nAm I making things up or did you also\nwanna mention the birthday paradox, or\n\n858\n00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:50.840\nsave that for a later time?\n\n859\n00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:52.607\n&gt;&gt; No, that is for\nasymmetric, non-symmetric.\n\n860\n00:40:52.607 --> 00:40:53.789\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n&gt;&gt; We wanna mention it, but\n\n861\n00:40:53.789 --> 00:40:55.229\nit's a function that comes\nup in the asymmetric.\n\n862\n00:40:55.229 --> 00:40:57.480\n&gt;&gt; A little bit later, okay,\nthat was a little bit of our teaser then.\n\n863\n00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:58.033\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there you go.\n\n864\n00:40:58.033 --> 00:40:59.402\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat was our Marvel teaser preview.\n\n865\n00:40:59.402 --> 00:41:01.734\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, well, thank you\nladies and gentlemen for joining us today,\n\n866\n00:41:01.734 --> 00:41:02.419\nbut we are out of time.\n\n867\n00:41:02.419 --> 00:41:07.170\nSo please stay tuned in for\nthe next episode here at ITProTV.\n\n868\n00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:09.910\nBut we'll go ahead and sign off,\nremember I'm Cherokee Boos.\n\n869\n00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:10.955\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n870\n00:41:10.955 --> 00:41:11.909\n&gt;&gt; See you next time, bye.\n\n871\n00:41:11.909 --> 00:41:19.688\n[MUSIC]\n\n872\n00:41:19.688 --> 00:41:21.630\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.095 --> 00:00:19.152\nIf you've been following along, you know\nthat we've reached episode number seven\n\n7\n00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:21.100\nhere examining symmetric cryptography and\nhashes.\n\n8\n00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.850\nSo with us today we have Mr.\nAdam Gordon in studios.\n\n9\n00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.570\nThank you for joining us today Adam.\n\n10\n00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:29.070\n&gt;&gt; Hello.\n&gt;&gt; Hi.\n\n11\n00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.185\n&gt;&gt; That's all I'm saying, hello.\n\n12\n00:00:31.185 --> 00:00:32.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Nothing more.\n\n13\n00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.050\nIt's all episode right there,\nwe could stop right now, that would be it.\n\n14\n00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.530\nThat's all you have to know.\n\n15\n00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:37.420\nHopefully everybody is doing well.\n\n16\n00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.720\nI'm kidding, I'm kidding,\nhopefully everybody is doing well.\n\n17\n00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.210\nHopefully you are joining\nus having gone through and\n\n18\n00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.870\nit was a was a long progression to\nget here as Cherokee was saying.\n\n19\n00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.708\nEpisode seven, that must be some sort of,\n\n20\n00:00:47.708 --> 00:00:50.173\n[CROSSTALK] a significant\nnumber of episodes milestone.\n\n21\n00:00:50.173 --> 00:00:51.530\nThat's a big one.\n\n22\n00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.240\nLuckily we didn't put a one in front\nof that cuz that would be like\n\n23\n00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.110\nten more episodes,\n\n24\n00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.630\nand you don't wanna go through that cuz\nthat would be way too much information.\n\n25\n00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.750\nBut we're gonna spend episode seven here,\nare wrapping up and\n\n26\n00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.630\nreally putting a capstone around and\non top of all of our\n\n27\n00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.280\ninformation about symmetric encryption,\nsymmetric cryptography, hashing.\n\n28\n00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.060\nAnd really, talk through the last\nlittle piece of the puzzle\n\n29\n00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.230\nmentioned in a few of our prior episodes.\n\n30\n00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:22.382\nThe discussion around stream cyphers and\nblock cyphers, how symmetric encryption is\n\n31\n00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:27.300\ngoing to be operating in these different\nmodalities and how we see the synchronous\n\n32\n00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.800\nor stream ciphering and the asynchronous\nor block ciphering solution working.\n\n33\n00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.070\nDescribe them for you.\n\n34\n00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.880\nWhat we haven't done until now, what\nwe're gonna do is put some pictures and\n\n35\n00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.780\nwords together and we're gonna actually\nwalk through the different modalities or\n\n36\n00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.920\ndifferent ways in which the block\ncypher implementation may work and\n\n37\n00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.400\nhow we're gonna see that transpiring or\nwhat those different solutions look like.\n\n38\n00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.440\nExplain them along the way, talk a bit\nabout them, show you a couple of wrinkles\n\n39\n00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.520\nand tricks and twist in there where things\ndon't necessarily operate the way you'd\n\n40\n00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.030\nthink they would or\nappear the way that they will.\n\n41\n00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.310\nAnd we'll talk through that and\n\n42\n00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.240\nI know Cherokee is gonna help me out\nto keep me honest here along the way.\n\n43\n00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.990\nAnd I'm sure she's gonna throw in some\nobservations that are always gonna\n\n44\n00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.010\nbe helpful to us to further clarify\nwhat it is we're looking at.\n\n45\n00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.680\nSo, let's just remind everybody while\nwe're getting started, the main difference\n\n46\n00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.290\nhere between streams and blocks-\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n47\n00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.550\n&gt;&gt; If you don't mind helping me that-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n48\n00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.900\n&gt;&gt; It's probably a good place to start.\n\n49\n00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.100\nSo, if we define a stream cipher, right?\n\n50\n00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.110\nWhat do we actually think about?\n\n51\n00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.420\nHow does this stream cipher\noperate on the data?\n\n52\n00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.230\nWhat would be the key characteristics?\n\n53\n00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.170\n&gt;&gt; Bit by bit.\n\n54\n00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.150\n&gt;&gt; Bit by bit, exactly.\n\n55\n00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.800\nSo what we're thinking of, is.\n\n56\n00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.610\nI like to think of it as a conveyor belt.\n\n57\n00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.160\nWe could think of it different ways.\n\n58\n00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.040\nWe'll get to the whole basket\nthing in just a second.\n\n59\n00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.780\n&gt;&gt; Conveyor belt is good.\n\n60\n00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.760\n&gt;&gt; Conveyor belt is good, right?\n\n61\n00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So we think about data dropping in,\n\n62\n00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.080\nbit by bit, as you said.\n\n63\n00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.060\nAnd dropping onto a conveyor belt.\n\n64\n00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.750\nAnd just being moved through and\nprocessed one bit at a time.\n\n65\n00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.430\nAnd in this sequential or\nlinear progression.\n\n66\n00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.140\nContinuously, we're processing that data,\nright?\n\n67\n00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.770\nThat's gonna be the hallmark, or\nthe key, no pun intended, key.\n\n68\n00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:56.885\nWait, I can do this even better.\n\n69\n00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:59.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The key characteristic.\n\n70\n00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.350\nI love these, by the way.\n\n71\n00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.288\nThis was like the-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n72\n00:03:01.288 --> 00:03:02.510\n&gt;&gt; Most brilliant\n\n73\n00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.490\nstrategy you came up with.\n\n74\n00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.500\nAnd we got to give credit to Cherokee,\nshe came in and\n\n75\n00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.690\nsaid hey, I've got these cool\nprops that we've gotta use.\n\n76\n00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.220\nBut this is, I've been using, it's like\nDaniel and I play with them, like all,\n\n77\n00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.240\nduring our episodes coming up, you'll see\nsome additional episodes where Daniel and\n\n78\n00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.200\nI using these things and\nplaying around, I love this.\n\n79\n00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.680\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; This is just so cool,\n\n80\n00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.050\nso very, very cool.\n\n81\n00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.630\nSo the key criteria that we use as\nthe hallmark, or the unique identifying\n\n82\n00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.590\ncharacteristic, of a stream cipher is\nthat bit by bit processing of data.\n\n83\n00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.670\nWhat about the block cipher?\n\n84\n00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:31.650\nWhat do we think of there?\n\n85\n00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:32.480\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I'm not going to call it\n\n86\n00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.100\na basket cipher.\n\n87\n00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.560\nI'm going to call it a block cipher.\n\n88\n00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.230\nBut you describe it the way you always do.\n\n89\n00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.730\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n90\n00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.170\nSo I have to kind of relate it to things.\n\n91\n00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.480\nSometimes, that's how my mind processes.\n\n92\n00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.160\nLucille Ball.\n\n93\n00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.640\nAnd what was her female co-star?\n\n94\n00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.930\n&gt;&gt; Ethel?\n&gt;&gt; Ethel, okay.\n\n95\n00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:46.450\nSo those two,\n\n96\n00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.570\nI don't know if you are familiar with that\nfamous episode where they're working in\n\n97\n00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.390\na chocolate factory and all the little\nchocolates are on the conveyor belt?\n\n98\n00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.710\n&gt;&gt; Well that would be the stream, though.\n\n99\n00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:54.770\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; That would be the stream, right.\n\n100\n00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.183\nSo that's a classic episode for\nTV, absolutely.\n\n101\n00:03:57.183 --> 00:03:58.339\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right.\n\n102\n00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:59.730\nSo to clean that up a bit.\n\n103\n00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.600\nIn my mind,\nwhen we're thinking about block ciphers,\n\n104\n00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.170\nwe're now putting baskets on the conveyor\nbelt and putting all those little\n\n105\n00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.120\npieces of chocolate inside of\nthe baskets that are still going.\n\n106\n00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.240\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so the conveyor belt concept\nworks but what we're doing is creating\n\n107\n00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.250\na container to hold a certain amount\nof the chocolate or the bits.\n\n108\n00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And those containers baskets or blocks,\n\n109\n00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.100\nwhatever we would call them,\n\n110\n00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.930\nremember formally when we're describing\nthis we're calling them blocks right.\n\n111\n00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.120\nWe talk about a block cypher,\na block of bits, a block of data.\n\n112\n00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.983\nCherokee likes to use the basket analogy.\n\n113\n00:04:28.983 --> 00:04:30.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We've been talking about baskets, but\n\n114\n00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.720\nI just want to make sure you know you're\nnot going to see baskets on an exam.\n\n115\n00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.510\nThis is not a basket cypher,\nthere is no such thing, but\n\n116\n00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.350\nwe are just using that\nas a way to describe it.\n\n117\n00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.440\nSo as you said you can\ncontextualize it and\n\n118\n00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.090\nmake it make sense to you\nin terms of what you know.\n\n119\n00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.190\nI like the Lucy analogy, very cool,\nbig fan of old school t.v.\n\n120\n00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.520\nAnd so when we're looking at that\nepisode where the conveyor belt with all\n\n121\n00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.380\nthe chocolate streaming by We would\nbe putting the chocolate pieces into\n\n122\n00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.300\nthese baskets or these blocks and\nif we fill every space and\n\n123\n00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.750\nthen we get essentially a certain amount,\nlet's say 128 bits,\n\n124\n00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.940\n64 bits, we said those are traditional\nclassic block sizes for\n\n125\n00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.500\na block cypher that we would\noften then be able to operate.\n\n126\n00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.830\nBut we wait to operate\nrather until that block or\n\n127\n00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.380\nthat basket is full of chocolate, right.\n\n128\n00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.630\nThose bits are there.\n\n129\n00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.230\nWhat if we winded up with not enough bits?\n\n130\n00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.660\nSo let's say we have 60 bits,\nbut we need 64, what do we do?\n\n131\n00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.300\n&gt;&gt; That's where the bubble\nwrap comes into play.\n\n132\n00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.400\nYou just shove the rest of that remaining\nspace full with the bubble wrap.\n\n133\n00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.131\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and so we put bubble wrap in.\n\n134\n00:05:32.131 --> 00:05:33.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But what do we actually, but\n\n135\n00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.000\nwhat's the formal name for\nputting bubble wrap in?\n\n136\n00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.970\n&gt;&gt; That's gonna be called padding.\n\n137\n00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.030\n&gt;&gt; That's gonna be called padding, right?\n\n138\n00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.890\nSo we actually are padding the block,\nthat's the terminology we use for it.\n\n139\n00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.970\nPadding the block in order\nto add the bubble wrap,\n\n140\n00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.565\nor let's translate the bubble wrap back\nto [LAUGH] what we're talking about.\n\n141\n00:05:47.565 --> 00:05:50.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're adding extra bits in of a random\n\n142\n00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.060\nnature, essentially garbage,\njust background noise\n\n143\n00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.670\n&gt;&gt; But we're adding them in so\n\n144\n00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.020\nthat we can round out the block\nwhich is what we refer to it as.\n\n145\n00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.640\nAnd we're padding in order to ensure\nthat the block is at full size,\n\n146\n00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.600\nbecause the key criteria,\nthe hallmark of the block cypher\n\n147\n00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.330\nis that we operate on the predetermined\nblock based on the size of the bits.\n\n148\n00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.270\nSo the block must be full size in order\nto be able to do that in most cases.\n\n149\n00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.650\nWe'll find out there are some\nimplementations of block ciphers\n\n150\n00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.940\nwhere we don't need to\nhave padding taking place.\n\n151\n00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.720\nWe can operate on a less than fully\noutfitted or full size block.\n\n152\n00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.380\nWe'll talk about that just in\na couple of minutes, so we have that.\n\n153\n00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.910\nWe also have one other thing\nthat we talked about and\n\n154\n00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.520\nthat we're gonna bring in and we're gonna\ntalk about and show here in a minute.\n\n155\n00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.210\nWhich is, I know this is\na topic you like a lot as well,\n\n156\n00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:34.910\nwhich is this idea of randomness, right?\n\n157\n00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.760\nSo we talked about this\nrandom thought process.\n\n158\n00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.560\nThe idea of using a,\nwhat we call, an initial vector.\n\n159\n00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.200\nAn IV, or an initial\n\n160\n00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:51.110\nthought process of randomly inserting\na predetermined number of bits.\n\n161\n00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.040\nBut we bind them with the plain\ntext up front traditionally.\n\n162\n00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:00.120\nAnd we use that as the initialization or\nthe catalyst to start the reaction.\n\n163\n00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:05.470\nAnd then we use that IV and we\nare diffusing and propagating it through.\n\n164\n00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:08.350\nWe've talked about diffusion,\nconfusion, the avalanche effect.\n\n165\n00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:10.280\nWe've been through this vocabulary before.\n\n166\n00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.640\nWe're gonna diffuse those changes\nthrough the entire process\n\n167\n00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.970\ngoing through a number of round functions.\n\n168\n00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:17.700\nRounds.\n\n169\n00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.770\nWe're gonna use something called\nthe exclusive OR, or the binary XOR.\n\n170\n00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:25.070\nWe've talked about this and\nXORing is how we'll refer to it.\n\n171\n00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.580\nAs we're XORing we're doing\na number of these iterations,\n\n172\n00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:29.705\na number of these rounds, right?\n\n173\n00:07:29.705 --> 00:07:34.430\nAnd every time we do that we either gonna\nstand on that output or we're gonna\n\n174\n00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:39.005\ntake that output and use it as the IV\nchain and feed it in to the next round so\n\n175\n00:07:39.005 --> 00:07:43.133\nthat we're further propagating\nfurther creating diffusion and\n\n176\n00:07:43.133 --> 00:07:45.184\nconfusion through the system.\n\n177\n00:07:45.184 --> 00:07:50.056\nAnd because of that we're gonna see\nthe output, 6, 8, 12, 24 rounds whatever\n\n178\n00:07:50.056 --> 00:07:54.796\ndown stream as being cypher text, we're\nnot gonna see it immediately cypher text,\n\n179\n00:07:54.796 --> 00:07:58.134\nwhich is what we call\nthe intermediate resultant, right,\n\n180\n00:07:58.134 --> 00:07:59.969\nto use the terms we spoke about.\n\n181\n00:07:59.969 --> 00:08:03.079\nThe resultant is commonly\njust the cipher text output,\n\n182\n00:08:03.079 --> 00:08:07.740\nthat is the intermediate cipher text that\nbecomes the input for the next round.\n\n183\n00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:08.450\nWe don't see that.\n\n184\n00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:10.440\nWe talked about the fact that this box,\n\n185\n00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.880\nthis mythical block,\nis happening behind the scenes.\n\n186\n00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.940\nWe don't see it,\nit's hidden from our view,\n\n187\n00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:20.260\nand all we see is the plain text going in,\nwe know a bunch of stuff happens in\n\n188\n00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.800\nthe middle,\nwe see cipher text out the back end.\n\n189\n00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.210\nBut the magic inside is black box,\n\n190\n00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:26.307\nwe don't really see it,\nwe don't understand it.\n\n191\n00:08:26.307 --> 00:08:29.899\nAnd all the stuff that happens\ninside is hidden from our view,\n\n192\n00:08:29.899 --> 00:08:31.760\non purpose and by design.\n\n193\n00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.860\nBecause what we don't want to have happen\nis we don't want to be able to get\n\n194\n00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:37.650\neither as the bad actors,\nwe never want this to happen, but\n\n195\n00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:41.340\nwe prevent the good actors,\nthe people that own the data and\n\n196\n00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:44.170\non the process from seeing\nthe intermediate cipher text,\n\n197\n00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:48.480\nbecause we're afraid if we show it to you,\nthen maybe a bad actor finds it, right?\n\n198\n00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.050\nWe don't want to expose this,\n\n199\n00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:54.340\nbecause it's much more likely that\none of those intermediate outputs,\n\n200\n00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.775\nthose intermediate resultants,\ncan be used to reverse engineer,\n\n201\n00:08:57.775 --> 00:09:01.860\nbecause we haven't fully diffused,\nfully confused, and fully obfuscated.\n\n202\n00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.705\nWe haven't done all the rounds,\nin other words.\n\n203\n00:09:03.705 --> 00:09:06.040\nAnd what we want to do is prevent that.\n\n204\n00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:09.685\nAnd ensure confidentiality,\nby only allowing the final outputs.\n\n205\n00:09:09.685 --> 00:09:13.070\n24 rounds after the fact to be seen.\n\n206\n00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:16.026\nBecause it's gonna be very\ndifficult to unwind all that and\n\n207\n00:09:16.026 --> 00:09:18.104\ngo all the way back and reverse engineer.\n\n208\n00:09:18.104 --> 00:09:21.550\nAnd this is why we hide all\nthe internal workings, the mechanisms.\n\n209\n00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:24.100\nAnd all the intermediate\noutputs that are fed back in.\n\n210\n00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:27.190\nWe're gonna see all this happen\nin our diagrams as we go.\n\n211\n00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:31.340\nThat's a lot of work to do in like\nyou know, the next 20 or so minutes.\n\n212\n00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.890\nI didn't really eat a good breakfast this\nmorning, I don't know if I'm up to this.\n\n213\n00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:35.273\n&gt;&gt; My god.\n&gt;&gt; You may have to actually do this,\n\n214\n00:09:35.273 --> 00:09:36.207\nI may have to go sit down.\n\n215\n00:09:36.207 --> 00:09:37.442\nSo I'm gonna go rest you're\ngonna go do all this.\n\n216\n00:09:37.442 --> 00:09:38.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We have some chairs [LAUGH].\n\n217\n00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.760\n&gt;&gt; We do have chairs,\nwe should actually get comfortable,\n\n218\n00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:41.750\nwe could do this so we'd be cool.\n\n219\n00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:44.360\nAll right so I'm gonna roll up\nmy sleeves as I've already done.\n\n220\n00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.065\nI'm going to make sure I look pretty.\n\n221\n00:09:46.065 --> 00:09:49.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And now we're gonna get started.\n\n222\n00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:52.430\nSo if we can go to my machine,\nif you would please, outstanding.\n\n223\n00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:56.780\nAnd let's start by talking about the first\nof several different mechanisms or\n\n224\n00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:59.860\nmodels that block ciphers\ncan operate under.\n\n225\n00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.360\nWe call this one the electronic hood book,\nwhat's called ECB.\n\n226\n00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.160\nYou can see that up on the screen.\n\n227\n00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.500\nWhat we did is we put together\njust a little maybe sentence or\n\n228\n00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:10.950\ntwo at the most, maybe a small paragraph\nof text describing the concept.\n\n229\n00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:13.900\nWe have a little picture that\nhelps you to understand each one.\n\n230\n00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.560\nBecause traditionally,\npictures are worth 1,000 words,\n\n231\n00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.120\nwhen we create them\nthey're worth double that.\n\n232\n00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:22.230\nBecause our picture is much more\nimpressive than anybody else's.\n\n233\n00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.510\nMike, Daniel, they don't know\nhow to make pictures, right?\n\n234\n00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:25.565\nBut, Cherokee?\n\n235\n00:10:25.565 --> 00:10:26.417\n[SOUND] Good pictures.\n\n236\n00:10:26.417 --> 00:10:29.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So this picture is worth 2,000 words.\n\n237\n00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:32.610\nBut I'm only gonna give you a few\nof them in order to describe this.\n\n238\n00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:34.052\nSo what do we see with ECB?\n\n239\n00:10:34.052 --> 00:10:35.060\nThis is interesting.\n\n240\n00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:37.600\nWe're gonna come back to this\ntowards the end of our conversation.\n\n241\n00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:42.292\nRemind ourselves of this,\nbecause this is a very stand alone\n\n242\n00:10:42.292 --> 00:10:46.348\nkind of disassociated way\nof using a block site for.\n\n243\n00:10:46.348 --> 00:10:49.370\nAnd this is not, although it's very\ntraditional, we use it quite often.\n\n244\n00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:53.300\nThis is not the majority of what\nblock cipher operation looks like.\n\n245\n00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.160\nAnd we're gonna see why\nhere as we talk about this.\n\n246\n00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.440\nBecause we see the blank text on the left,\nlet's just look here.\n\n247\n00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.100\nAnd by the way, one,\ntwo, three operations.\n\n248\n00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:04.010\nEveryone's identical as you can see,\nthey stand alone essentially.\n\n249\n00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:07.280\nThey're siloed, but they're unique,\nthey're just copies of one another.\n\n250\n00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:11.460\nAnd so we see plain text up here,\nwhatever that would be.\n\n251\n00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:13.850\nOur favorite sentence,\nthe dog is green, no period or period,\n\n252\n00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:15.100\nwhatever you would like, right?\n\n253\n00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:18.320\nAnd we have the key and\nwe have the block cipher encryption, so\n\n254\n00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.480\nthis is where the algorithm is applied.\n\n255\n00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.970\nThis is where the magic happens,\nthis is the black box.\n\n256\n00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:24.680\nWe talked about running through.\n\n257\n00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.820\nAnd out at the bottom we get cipher text.\n\n258\n00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:30.010\nNow its pretty straightforward\nthought process here.\n\n259\n00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:35.020\nGood input in plain text, good key, good\nblock cipher, good ciphering taking place.\n\n260\n00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:39.760\nSo our crypto system is solid and then at\nthe bottom we get out output, cipher text.\n\n261\n00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.840\nBut what you'll notice here is that\nthe cipher text output is just that,\n\n262\n00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.580\nit's there, it's stand alone.\n\n263\n00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.900\nWe don't take the cipher text and\n\n264\n00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:52.590\nuse it to feed back into another\noperation, we start with more plain text.\n\n265\n00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:57.390\nAnd so, we only do one round,\none round function, what we call a round,\n\n266\n00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:01.580\nwe do one round of encryption when\nwe do electronic code booking.\n\n267\n00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.976\nEach block is encrypted independently, but\n\n268\n00:12:03.976 --> 00:12:08.530\nidentical plain text blocks are encrypted\ninto identical cipher text blocks.\n\n269\n00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:09.970\nThis is a problem, right?\n\n270\n00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:14.441\nThe dog is green three times, we get\nthe exact same cipher text out the bottom.\n\n271\n00:12:14.441 --> 00:12:16.963\nIf you remember,\nwhen you and I were talking,\n\n272\n00:12:16.963 --> 00:12:20.140\nand we were talking about patterns and\nsameness, right?\n\n273\n00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:24.320\nAnd we were stressing the fact that\ncollisions and any kind of pattern\n\n274\n00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:28.930\ndue to frequency analysis, we may be\nable to discover a weakness, right?\n\n275\n00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:32.044\nWhat we will call vulnerability in\nthe language of risk management and\n\n276\n00:12:32.044 --> 00:12:33.374\nin the language of security.\n\n277\n00:12:33.374 --> 00:12:34.812\nAnd those things are bad, right?\n\n278\n00:12:34.812 --> 00:12:37.530\nBecause potentially,\nthey give a bad actor a hook.\n\n279\n00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:41.080\nThey give them the ability to find\nsomething that they could use to pry open\n\n280\n00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.494\nthe system potentially and\ntake advantage of it.\n\n281\n00:12:43.494 --> 00:12:44.070\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n282\n00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:48.000\n&gt;&gt; So this would be a potential issue,\na concern for us,\n\n283\n00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.160\nknowing that if I encrypt the same plain\ntext at 20 different points in this\n\n284\n00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:58.280\nline over an hour, I'm gonna get\n20 identical cipher text outputs.\n\n285\n00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:02.160\nIf somebody finds that pattern because\nmaybe they're observing this traffic flow\n\n286\n00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.500\nfor 60 minutes.\n\n287\n00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.170\nThey're capturing all this traffic.\n\n288\n00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:09.340\nAnd they have an automated process that\nscans the output of those files and\n\n289\n00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:10.390\nsays, look.\n\n290\n00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:12.250\n20 different items match.\n\n291\n00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:13.410\nDing, ding, ding, right?\n\n292\n00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:17.680\nWe have 20 items that are identical,\nwe can now begin to develop a pattern or\n\n293\n00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:22.490\na frequency we can see to potentially use\nthat to our advantage as a bad actor.\n\n294\n00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:27.355\nSo although ECB is a legitimate thought\nprocess around implementation of block\n\n295\n00:13:27.355 --> 00:13:31.740\nciphers, to use all the time for\ncertain things, it's not\n\n296\n00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:35.491\none of the primary mechanisms or ways in\nwhich we would implement a block cipher.\n\n297\n00:13:35.491 --> 00:13:39.716\nIt's like using which is where it get's\nname, it's like using a code book.\n\n298\n00:13:39.716 --> 00:13:44.174\nThis is my code right and so\nmy code is abc123, if I encode that and\n\n299\n00:13:44.174 --> 00:13:49.530\nthat's my key, whenever I encode the same\ndata it spits out the same thing.\n\n300\n00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:51.180\nAnd that's really the challenge with this.\n\n301\n00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:54.315\nThere's no way to diffuse or confuse or\n\n302\n00:13:54.315 --> 00:13:59.255\ninject randomness through an IV and\nmultiple rounds or x ors,\n\n303\n00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:03.913\nround functions that are used\nto further propagate this.\n\n304\n00:14:03.913 --> 00:14:07.240\nAnd that's what we're gonna start adding\nin terms complexity here as we go, right?\n\n305\n00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.910\nSo we're gonna see that as we\nmove down to our next item,\n\n306\n00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:11.790\nlet's just scroll down here.\n\n307\n00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:14.200\nWe have cipher block chaining.\n\n308\n00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.210\nIt's called CBC.\n\n309\n00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:18.770\nJust expose this so we can see this.\n\n310\n00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:21.420\nCipher block chaining looks\na little bit different.\n\n311\n00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:24.630\nThe key word that we pivot\non here is chaining, right?\n\n312\n00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:27.223\nBecause chaining, as we were describing,\n\n313\n00:14:27.223 --> 00:14:29.962\nis gonna allow us to take\nthe output of one run.\n\n314\n00:14:29.962 --> 00:14:32.944\nYou'll see that down here as\nwe get our cipher text and\n\n315\n00:14:32.944 --> 00:14:36.522\nwe have our arrow that's pointing over and\nmaking it the input or\n\n316\n00:14:36.522 --> 00:14:40.080\nimplying that it will become\nthe input of the next round.\n\n317\n00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.750\nAnd this going to allow us to defuse and\nconfuse.\n\n318\n00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:45.740\nAnd not only that,\nthrough the round function,\n\n319\n00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:48.650\nthrough this thing which Cherokee is\ngoing to describe for us in a second.\n\n320\n00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:52.410\nBut before we do that, we also are,\nyou'll notice, adding a catalyst,\n\n321\n00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:55.300\nan initialization injection of randomness,\n\n322\n00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:59.290\ninitially an initialization vector that\nallows us, from the very beginning,\n\n323\n00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:03.720\nbefore we even start, to ensure\nthat we are as secure as we can be.\n\n324\n00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:08.200\nBecause by injecting\nthe initialization vector up front,\n\n325\n00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:12.050\nwe're inputting and creating confusion and\ndiffusion immediately.\n\n326\n00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:15.928\nAnd because of that, and remember\nthe ideas of confusion and diffusion.\n\n327\n00:15:15.928 --> 00:15:20.248\nClaude Shannon describes diffusion for\nus and the information theory and\n\n328\n00:15:20.248 --> 00:15:23.700\nthen remember Horst Feistel,\nthat's real fun to say.\n\n329\n00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:27.521\nHorst Feistel, Mr. Feistel,\ntakes that concept, improves on it,\n\n330\n00:15:27.521 --> 00:15:30.784\ncomes up with the concept of\nthe avalanche effect, right?\n\n331\n00:15:30.784 --> 00:15:33.308\nA complete avalanche,\naccording to Feistel,\n\n332\n00:15:33.308 --> 00:15:37.430\nwould be the idea of one bit changing and\nchanging all the cipher text output.\n\n333\n00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:40.928\nA partial avalanche or just an avalanche\nwould be some bits changing and\n\n334\n00:15:40.928 --> 00:15:43.917\nsome output changing, but\nnot the entire output changing.\n\n335\n00:15:43.917 --> 00:15:46.732\nSo what we want to see here,\nfrom the beginning,\n\n336\n00:15:46.732 --> 00:15:51.196\nis this idea that the initialization\nvector allows us to inject an additional\n\n337\n00:15:51.196 --> 00:15:55.935\ncontrol mechanism, an additional security\nfeature that makes it even harder for\n\n338\n00:15:55.935 --> 00:15:59.940\nthe bad actor to walk all the way back,\nreverse engineering as we go.\n\n339\n00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.160\nIn order to derive the plain text, right?\n\n340\n00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.368\nSo this is gonna be some of\nthe important features, and\n\n341\n00:16:04.368 --> 00:16:06.052\nimportant characteristics we see here.\n\n342\n00:16:06.052 --> 00:16:07.705\nAll right, I know you've been\npatiently waiting in here.\n\n343\n00:16:07.705 --> 00:16:08.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're dying to jump in and\n\n344\n00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:10.340\ntell me what this circle is.\n\n345\n00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.580\nSo let me just walk through the process,\nlet's get to it.\n\n346\n00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:13.630\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Then I want you to\n\n347\n00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:14.660\nremind us of what this is.\n\n348\n00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:17.840\nCuz You're the one in the power up, so\nthat actually describes this exact thing.\n\n349\n00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.650\nSo I want you to tell us\nwhat it is this time.\n\n350\n00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:20.615\nNo pressure by the way.\n\n351\n00:16:20.615 --> 00:16:21.994\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But if you get it wrong, or\n\n352\n00:16:21.994 --> 00:16:23.771\ndon't use the exact words, right?\n\n353\n00:16:23.771 --> 00:16:24.670\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n354\n00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:27.426\n&gt;&gt; Then we're going to take away your\nability to use your private key.\n\n355\n00:16:27.426 --> 00:16:28.072\n&gt;&gt; No more key master.\n\n356\n00:16:28.072 --> 00:16:30.440\n&gt;&gt; And no more key master, you're not\ngoing to do the key master anymore.\n\n357\n00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.140\nAll right, so we've got our plain text up\ntop here, right, we know what that is.\n\n358\n00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:36.130\nWe've got our initialization factor,\nwe've talked about this for IV.\n\n359\n00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:38.380\nNow, at that point we come this junction,\n\n360\n00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:40.540\nit's kind of an interesting symbol here,\nright.\n\n361\n00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:45.670\nAnd we see it repeated in the same place\napproximately across every operation.\n\n362\n00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:48.430\nSo let's discuss what that is,\ncuz Cherokee actually called this out and\n\n363\n00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:52.150\nidentified it for us in our prior episode,\nand it was a very,\n\n364\n00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:55.060\nvery important item, and\nI wanna make sure we hit on it here.\n\n365\n00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:57.740\nSo what does that represent graphically,\nand what does that actually do for us?\n\n366\n00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:00.620\n&gt;&gt; The exclusive OR or XOR.\n\n367\n00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:03.990\n&gt;&gt; The XOR or exclusive OR, absolutely,\nand you've described it for us exactly,\n\n368\n00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:06.140\ncuz you said you know,\na lot of times they'll diagram this.\n\n369\n00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:08.180\nAnd we'll see that as\nthe circle with either the X or\n\n370\n00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:11.450\nthe cross, depending on how it's turned,\njust kind of how you display it, right?\n\n371\n00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:13.745\nIf you turn it a hair kind of sideways,\nkind of like this.\n\n372\n00:17:13.745 --> 00:17:15.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It looks like an X, but\n\n373\n00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:17.670\nif you turn in back like this,\nit's kind of like a cross.\n\n374\n00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:18.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; If you stand on your head,\n\n375\n00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:20.830\nit looks the same, but\nexcept that you're upside-down.\n\n376\n00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:23.090\nSo I'm not doing that\none by the way because.\n\n377\n00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:23.618\n&gt;&gt; Don't ask me.\n\n378\n00:17:23.618 --> 00:17:24.188\n&gt;&gt; You don't wanna see me fall.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n379\n00:17:24.188 --> 00:17:25.931\n&gt;&gt; But if you do that, or\nif we turn the screen, but\n\n380\n00:17:25.931 --> 00:17:27.520\nI don't think we can rotate the screen.\n\n381\n00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:30.030\nThat would be kind of cool, but\nwe can't rotate the screen.\n\n382\n00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:32.333\nSo at home, while you're doing this, just\nkind of do this while you're watching.\n\n383\n00:17:32.333 --> 00:17:33.426\n&gt;&gt; Turn your laptop upside down.\n\n384\n00:17:33.426 --> 00:17:35.360\n&gt;&gt; And turn the laptop upside down and\nyou'll see it.\n\n385\n00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.560\nIt looks exactly like\nwhat we're describing.\n\n386\n00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:41.161\nAnd if you believe me I have a bridge\nto sell you somewhere in New York.\n\n387\n00:17:41.161 --> 00:17:44.804\nAll right, so initialization vector,\nas Cherokee was describing,\n\n388\n00:17:44.804 --> 00:17:49.230\nthe circle with the cross or the x\nrepresents the XOR exclusive OR function.\n\n389\n00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:55.100\nAnd remember the XOR is combining\nthe inputs together doing the comparison,\n\n390\n00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:58.160\ngenerating out a value,\nwhat we call a resultant, and\n\n391\n00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.560\nthen using that to then go ahead and\nact as the input.\n\n392\n00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.830\nAnd so we're taking plain text,\n\n393\n00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:06.440\nthe IV we're XORing,\nwe're importing that stream, right?\n\n394\n00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.910\nThat's gonna be remember,\nultimately ones and zeroes.\n\n395\n00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:10.910\nThat's our binary, right?\n\n396\n00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:15.440\nOR it's actually called in binary math,\nthe binary OR, which are the binary XOR,\n\n397\n00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:18.920\nexcuse me, which is commonly\nreferred to as the exclusive OR.\n\n398\n00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.523\nAnd so the binary XOR output,\n\n399\n00:18:20.523 --> 00:18:23.330\nthe resultant then comes in,\nwe combine it with the key,\n\n400\n00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:27.770\ndo the block cypher encryption,\nget the result in cypher text out.\n\n401\n00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:31.880\nThat cypher text doesn't stand on\nits own the way it did at ECB.\n\n402\n00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:37.340\nInstead what we now see is we\ntake that output we now use it as\n\n403\n00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:42.600\nthe new initialization vector along\nwith the plain text XOR again and\n\n404\n00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.620\nthen use that as the input for\nthe next round.\n\n405\n00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:50.700\nAnd our round function, number of rounds\nthat we're gonna do this for would simply\n\n406\n00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:54.780\nbe the number of times we reproduce this\ndiagram kind of going off to the right.\n\n407\n00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:58.200\nThis implies, and this is not accurate\nbecause you wouldn't do a three round, but\n\n408\n00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.290\nthis implies that we have\na three round solution.\n\n409\n00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:04.820\nYou typically have some\nsort of a even number.\n\n410\n00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:08.980\nSo you're gonna have a 4 round,\na 12 round, a 16 round, an 8 round.\n\n411\n00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:12.862\nThat's the number you would normally see\nassociated with a block algorithm and so,\n\n412\n00:19:12.862 --> 00:19:16.412\nwe would see, that this would probably\nbe at least a minimum of an 8 round, or\n\n413\n00:19:16.412 --> 00:19:20.019\na 16 round, but, you know, we can't\nreproduce all that cuz it would be like\n\n414\n00:19:20.019 --> 00:19:20.540\nthis big,\n\n415\n00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:21.099\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n416\n00:19:21.099 --> 00:19:22.893\nyou wouldn't be able to tell what it was.\nBut you get the idea, right?\n\n417\n00:19:22.893 --> 00:19:25.152\nFor purposes of demonstration,\nwe're just showing you a three round.\n\n418\n00:19:25.152 --> 00:19:29.230\nSo the idea would be that\nwe take this output here.\n\n419\n00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:35.310\nIt is now moved over and what we now do\nis use this as the initialization vector.\n\n420\n00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:38.480\nAnd, we combine it through the XOR\nthe with the plain text and\n\n421\n00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.340\nwe go back through again and\nwe're doing this multiple round, and,\n\n422\n00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:45.740\nas a result of this what we are doing\nis confusing and diffusing.\n\n423\n00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:49.710\nWe're pushing additional changes through,\nuntil we get to the output where we say\n\n424\n00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:53.980\nokay, this is the 12th round, and\nthen that final time is where we\n\n425\n00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:58.360\nactually take that cypher text, and\nwe no longer propagate it across, but\n\n426\n00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:02.210\nwe actually use it as the result in cipher\ntext that we're gonna operate with.\n\n427\n00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:05.060\nNow we could imply here if\nwe did three rounds and\n\n428\n00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:08.160\nthat the cipher text is outputted at\nthe bottom, that would be how it works.\n\n429\n00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:12.370\nBut with any number of rounds, the last\nround would simply be the final output and\n\n430\n00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:16.330\nwe no longer use that we simply or\nrather no longer propagate it forward and\n\n431\n00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:20.240\nuse it as input, but rather simply use\nit as output and that's where we go.\n\n432\n00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:25.510\nSo SB or CBC, cypher block chaining with\nencryption is gonna operate this way.\n\n433\n00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:29.890\nAnd you can see we just described this up\nabove and we take that thought process and\n\n434\n00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:30.810\nwe push it forward.\n\n435\n00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:34.034\nThis is a very common implementation for\nblock ciphers, right?\n\n436\n00:20:34.034 --> 00:20:36.090\nWe would see this often,\nvery, very common.\n\n437\n00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:37.126\nLet's scroll down.\n\n438\n00:20:37.126 --> 00:20:39.083\nI'm gonna add a little twist to this,\n\n439\n00:20:39.083 --> 00:20:42.040\nsomething known as propagating\ncipher block chaining.\n\n440\n00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:45.660\nNow I'm not gonna be able to keep\nthe text and the diagram together.\n\n441\n00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:48.590\nSo what we're gonna do is just quickly\ndescribe it, and then we'll take a look\n\n442\n00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:51.840\nat the diagram, but we can go back up and\nrefer to the text if we need to.\n\n443\n00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:56.910\nBut when we think about propagating cipher\nblock chaining we're thinking about CBC,\n\n444\n00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:59.800\nso the base cipher block\ntraining we just described, but\n\n445\n00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.510\nwe're using propagating, right.\n\n446\n00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:05.340\nAnd so what we're gonna do is we're gonna\nsee that there are gonna be two XORs,\n\n447\n00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:06.360\ninstead of one.\n\n448\n00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:10.085\nWe're gonna propagate the XOR\nfrom the plain text block and\n\n449\n00:21:10.085 --> 00:21:11.955\nwe're gonna move it across.\n\n450\n00:21:11.955 --> 00:21:15.428\nYou're gonna see this is\nkind of interesting, so\n\n451\n00:21:15.428 --> 00:21:18.248\nwhoops, scrolling down the wrong way.\n\n452\n00:21:18.248 --> 00:21:21.300\nAll right, so\nwhat we are doing here is the following.\n\n453\n00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.110\nWe are taking the plane text,\nwe are doing the IV,\n\n454\n00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:29.470\nwe are doing the initial XOR here, running\nit through and getting the cipher text.\n\n455\n00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:33.900\nSo this part right here take away\nthis little bracketed arrow and\n\n456\n00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.010\nthis secondary XOR right here.\n\n457\n00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:39.330\nSo take away like this little\nu over here on this side.\n\n458\n00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:42.560\nWhen we do this and\nwe remove that from just a second, and\n\n459\n00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.870\nwe just simply comes\nstraight down this way.\n\n460\n00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:50.520\nWhat we're seeing is the CBC,\nthis is the plain text, IV, XOR,\n\n461\n00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:55.610\nkey block cipher encryption cipher text,\nwe go all the way down for all that.\n\n462\n00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:58.640\nThat's the CBC portion,\nwhat we saw from before.\n\n463\n00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:02.340\nWell, we're adding in through propagation,\nthe p part, right?\n\n464\n00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:06.620\nThe propagating part is we're\ntaking this process and\n\n465\n00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:10.130\nwe're going to take this plain text IV,\nthe XOR of this,\n\n466\n00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:14.725\nwe're going to take this and we're going\nto XOR this again with the cypher text.\n\n467\n00:22:14.725 --> 00:22:20.730\nWe're adding a secondary XORing or\nsecondary exclusive OR further confusing,\n\n468\n00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:26.230\nfurther diffusing, further pushing\nthrough that randomness that we want and\n\n469\n00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:30.490\nmaking it even harder for\na bad actor to reverse engineer this,\n\n470\n00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:32.960\nbecause what we're getting is\nnow we're getting two, right?\n\n471\n00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:37.210\nNot one, but we're getting two XORS, it's\nkinda interesting when you think about it,\n\n472\n00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:41.760\nbecause when we do the CBC part,\njust here we have that one XOR.\n\n473\n00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:44.930\nBut now we're taking\nthe output of that XOR and\n\n474\n00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:48.780\nwe're taking the output of the cipher\ntext and we're XORing them again and\n\n475\n00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:52.650\nthat combined XOR now becomes\nthe new initialization vector.\n\n476\n00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:58.190\nThe new input IV for the next XOR around,\nagain we go plain text,\n\n477\n00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:03.295\ninput IV, XOR that, output that,\ntake that plus the cipher text,\n\n478\n00:23:03.295 --> 00:23:07.900\nXOR it again, move that Forward and\nmake that the input for the next round.\n\n479\n00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:10.190\nAnd again,\nremember this would be multiple rounds.\n\n480\n00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:13.968\nIf we did eight rounds we would see eight\ngoing forward, on the eighth round,\n\n481\n00:23:13.968 --> 00:23:15.595\nthe final output is received, so\n\n482\n00:23:15.595 --> 00:23:19.271\nthe cipher text at the end is what we\nwould show to whoever's running this.\n\n483\n00:23:19.271 --> 00:23:22.570\nAnd this is what we would send or\nwhat we would put in storage,\n\n484\n00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:25.080\nthis is the secure form of that data.\n\n485\n00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:30.120\nBut this uses two XORs per round\nin order to propagate further and\n\n486\n00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:33.690\nfurther drive in that confusion and\ndiffusion we're talking about.\n\n487\n00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:35.020\nPretty school stuff when\nyou think about it.\n\n488\n00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:38.276\nThis is a newer thought process\npropagating cyber block chaining.\n\n489\n00:23:38.276 --> 00:23:41.632\nWhen I say new, I wouldn't say super\nnew as in wow we just came up with this\n\n490\n00:23:41.632 --> 00:23:43.283\nbecause that would be cool if you and\n\n491\n00:23:43.283 --> 00:23:45.910\nI just created this while\nwe were standing here.\n\n492\n00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:48.200\nBut we wouldn't call\nit PCBC at that point,\n\n493\n00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.480\nwe'd probably call it something like C for\nCherokee.\n\n494\n00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwe have to put our names in there.\n\n495\n00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:55.569\n&gt;&gt; So that would be like the Cherokee\nBlock Propagation Cypher Mode thing or\n\n496\n00:23:55.569 --> 00:23:56.220\nwhatever.\n\n497\n00:23:56.220 --> 00:24:00.199\nBut instead, when I say newer,\nwhat I mean is some of these ones we've\n\n498\n00:24:00.199 --> 00:24:04.658\nbeen talking about, ECB, CBC, Have been\naround for a very, very long time.\n\n499\n00:24:04.658 --> 00:24:08.710\nPCBC is a newer thought process, that\ncomes around a little bit after some of\n\n500\n00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:13.014\nthe older ones have been in play for a\nwhile, to add some additional protection,\n\n501\n00:24:13.014 --> 00:24:15.510\nsend some additional\nlayers of control here.\n\n502\n00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:22.230\nSo we see PCBC, then we have cipher\nfeedback, let's bring this one up.\n\n503\n00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:25.393\nCipher FeedBack, what's called CFB,\nCipher FeedBack,\n\n504\n00:24:25.393 --> 00:24:28.120\nyou'll see allows encryption\nof partial blocks.\n\n505\n00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:31.700\nRemember, we talked about the fact that\nnormally we have to pad the block if\n\n506\n00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:32.670\nit's not full.\n\n507\n00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:36.980\nSo the first three of these that we've\nbeen talking about assume a full block.\n\n508\n00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:39.271\nIf it's not 128 bits, we have to pad it.\n\n509\n00:24:39.271 --> 00:24:41.645\nAlthough we didn't show\npadding in the diagram,\n\n510\n00:24:41.645 --> 00:24:44.770\nwe would be padding the block\nto get it to full size.\n\n511\n00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:48.060\nHere, we're saying, you know what,\nwe don't need a full block.\n\n512\n00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:50.260\nLet's go ahead and let's operate\nat what we call partial block, and\n\n513\n00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:52.860\nas a result, we eliminate the need to pad.\n\n514\n00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:54.773\nSo we're eliminating padding, and\n\n515\n00:24:54.773 --> 00:24:58.424\nwe're allowing ourselves to operate\non partial blocks if required.\n\n516\n00:24:58.424 --> 00:25:01.184\nCFB doesn't mean that we will\nalways have partial blocks,\n\n517\n00:25:01.184 --> 00:25:05.355\nit just means that if we do wind up with\npartial blocks, we won't have to pad them.\n\n518\n00:25:05.355 --> 00:25:08.680\nTraditionally, partial blocks wind\nup typically at the end of the run,\n\n519\n00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.492\nbecause we're chunking all the data.\n\n520\n00:25:10.492 --> 00:25:12.840\nAnd then whatever's left over at the very,\n\n521\n00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.652\nvery end of that stream is\nusually a partial block.\n\n522\n00:25:15.652 --> 00:25:16.402\n&gt;&gt; Your remainder.\n\n523\n00:25:16.402 --> 00:25:17.432\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, whatever the remainder is.\n\n524\n00:25:17.432 --> 00:25:21.132\nWe would call that a modulus operator\nwhen we're gonna talk about those and\n\n525\n00:25:21.132 --> 00:25:24.452\ndefine them in asymmetric cryptography\nin some upcoming episodes.\n\n526\n00:25:24.452 --> 00:25:27.362\nThe modulus operator's just\nthe remainder after you do the division.\n\n527\n00:25:27.362 --> 00:25:30.387\nThat's the fancy mathematical term for,\nwe have something left over,\n\n528\n00:25:30.387 --> 00:25:31.650\nwhat do we do with it, right?\n\n529\n00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:34.769\nSo that's what we're gonna do,\nwe're gonna put in a partial block, and\n\n530\n00:25:34.769 --> 00:25:35.890\nthat's what we'll see.\n\n531\n00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:38.413\nSo CFB allows us to get out\nfrom under padding, and\n\n532\n00:25:38.413 --> 00:25:41.530\ndo this without necessarily\nbuilding up the block fully.\n\n533\n00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:43.910\nYou'll see we have the IV here,\nwe have the key,\n\n534\n00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:48.990\nnotice that the XOR, right, is occurring\ndown here, as opposed to up here.\n\n535\n00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:53.430\nWe put the IV in with the key, we then\nXOR the plaintext to the ciphertext, or\n\n536\n00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:57.500\nexcuse me, XOR the plaintext,\nand get the resulting ciphertext.\n\n537\n00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:02.410\nWe take that output,\nthat becomes the new IV, run that through,\n\n538\n00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:04.900\nagain plaintext XOR at\nthe bottom to generate this.\n\n539\n00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:09.430\nSo the XORing's occurring at a different\nlevel than the model, different location.\n\n540\n00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:15.020\nAnd the plain text is being inserted,\nnot at the top as our initial input,\n\n541\n00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:17.950\nbut rather the initial\ninput comes from the IV.\n\n542\n00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:21.060\nAnd then we're using the plaintext\nto drive the XOR function,\n\n543\n00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:25.400\nallowing us to create and push through\nthe diffusion and confusion, but\n\n544\n00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.778\nfrom a different perspective.\n\n545\n00:26:26.778 --> 00:26:28.980\nSo it's just a matter of how\nwe choose to do this, and\n\n546\n00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:31.320\nwhere we choose to engage\nin these activities.\n\n547\n00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:35.860\nThis is called Cipher FeedBack mode, or\nwhat's commonly called CFB, right, so\n\n548\n00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:36.500\nwe have CFB.\n\n549\n00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.920\nLet's continue on.\n\n550\n00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:42.130\nWe have what's known as\nOutput FeedBack mode.\n\n551\n00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:46.949\nAgain, I'm not gonna be able to put,\nOutbook, Output FeedBack mode,\n\n552\n00:26:46.949 --> 00:26:48.693\nlet me speak slowly here.\n\n553\n00:26:48.693 --> 00:26:52.280\nLet me just try scrolling in,\nbecause I did not scroll properly.\n\n554\n00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.040\nLet's put OFB up,\njust quickly describe, and\n\n555\n00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.687\nthen we'll take a look at the diagonal\nspace and how it's broken down.\n\n556\n00:26:56.687 --> 00:26:58.735\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Remember that we're giving you this\n\n557\n00:26:58.735 --> 00:27:01.970\nwhole Word document as part of the show\nnotes, with all these diagrams.\n\n558\n00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:04.500\nSo you will be able to go through them and\nkinda split them out,\n\n559\n00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:05.660\ndo what you want with them.\n\n560\n00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:08.340\nFigure them out, use them as\nthe background or the skeleton for\n\n561\n00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:09.290\nyour own notes.\n\n562\n00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:12.070\nBut just the way we broke them down in\nthe document, and the kind of the spacing,\n\n563\n00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:14.990\nit's tough sometimes to get everything on\nthere and still make it look big enough,\n\n564\n00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:16.200\nso you can actually see it.\n\n565\n00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:19.100\nCuz again it was like this big when\nI squished it all together, and\n\n566\n00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:20.700\nit's really hard to squint and see.\n\n567\n00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.064\nCherokee didn't wear her glasses.\n\n568\n00:27:22.064 --> 00:27:22.682\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I\n\n569\n00:27:22.682 --> 00:27:23.910\ndon't have my seeing eye human with me.\n\n570\n00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:26.526\nSo, there will be no way for\nme to be able to figure that out either.\n\n571\n00:27:26.526 --> 00:27:28.220\nAll right, so OFB, what's this?\n\n572\n00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:31.910\nThis is, as you could see, a block,\nbut this is interesting, right?\n\n573\n00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:34.800\nOur block cipher is about to flip and\nbecome stream.\n\n574\n00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:39.182\nAnd I said there are certain times where\nblocks don't necessarily operate the way\n\n575\n00:27:39.182 --> 00:27:40.079\nthey appear to.\n\n576\n00:27:40.079 --> 00:27:42.839\nAnd OFB, which is what we're\ngonna talk about now, and\n\n577\n00:27:42.839 --> 00:27:46.870\nsomething known as counter mode, CTR,\nwhich we'll talk about in a minute.\n\n578\n00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:52.200\nThese last two mechanisms or modes, these\nmodalities, implement block ciphers and\n\n579\n00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:56.040\ntrick us, and make them appear, and\nindeed they operate as, streams.\n\n580\n00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.950\nSo we flip the block and\nmake it look like a stream.\n\n581\n00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:00.860\nSo it's a block that\noperates like a stream.\n\n582\n00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:03.270\nWhy we just don't call it a stream and\nsay it's a stream?\n\n583\n00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:05.050\nWell, then we would have\nnothing to talk about here,\n\n584\n00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:08.190\nand we actually have time left,\nso I had to make it this way.\n\n585\n00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:10.140\nCuz otherwise, what would we put here?\n\n586\n00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:13.590\nI could teach you how to make a great cup\nof coffee, but not everybody likes coffee.\n\n587\n00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:14.460\nThat could be a problem.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n588\n00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:15.709\n&gt;&gt; This is our random aside for\n\n589\n00:28:15.709 --> 00:28:16.910\nthe episode, by the way.\n\n590\n00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:23.460\nAll right, so we're gonna talk about OFB,\na block operating as a synchronous stream.\n\n591\n00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:26.410\nNow what would be the advantage of\na block operating like a stream?\n\n592\n00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:30.150\nIn other words, why would it be valuable\nfor us to take a block, 128 bits,\n\n593\n00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:34.910\nlet's say, hypothetically, in our basket,\nand convert that into a stream?\n\n594\n00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:39.270\nIs there value in that, is there some\nsort of thing that makes this worthwhile?\n\n595\n00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:41.950\n&gt;&gt; Maybe just a stable computing,\n\n596\n00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:46.070\nlike processing it would be more stable,\nthe flow.\n\n597\n00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:49.940\nMaybe faster, because instead of,\nI guess it would depend on\n\n598\n00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.270\nthe amount that's being encrypted\nat one particular time.\n\n599\n00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:53.940\nIs it one bit?\n\n600\n00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.700\n&gt;&gt; Well, when we operate as a stream,\nwe operate one bit at a time.\n\n601\n00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:58.639\n&gt;&gt; So yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We do, so right, we're operating,\n\n602\n00:28:58.639 --> 00:29:00.269\nwe're chunking the bits, right?\n\n603\n00:29:00.269 --> 00:29:02.244\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So just get that straight there so\n\n604\n00:29:02.244 --> 00:29:03.353\nwe could see that.\n\n605\n00:29:03.353 --> 00:29:05.474\nSo there is value in terms of the speed,\n\n606\n00:29:05.474 --> 00:29:08.810\nyou're absolutely right by\nthinking about it that way.\n\n607\n00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:12.150\nBecause the idea is that,\nsince we're operating continuously, right,\n\n608\n00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:14.320\nthe conveyor belt concept\nyou were talking about.\n\n609\n00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:17.310\nSo when we have that conveyor belt,\nremember as you probably know from\n\n610\n00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:20.505\nthe Lucy episode, doesn't slow down,\nonly speeds up, right?\n\n611\n00:29:20.505 --> 00:29:23.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So as a result, we're continuously\n\n612\n00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:27.470\noperating on each bit, we're getting those\nbits in and out of the system quickly.\n\n613\n00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:30.950\nWhen we're waiting to put them into\nthe baskets or the block, we have to wait\n\n614\n00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:35.150\nasynchronously for that block to be\nfilled up, to be able to work on a block.\n\n615\n00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:39.840\nAnd it takes longer to work on 128 or\n64, whatever the number may be,\n\n616\n00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:43.240\nof bits, than it is to work on\na single bit one after the other.\n\n617\n00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.720\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So there is actually a performance of\n\n618\n00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:49.440\nspeed factor here that would allow us to\ngain some benefit if we flip this and\n\n619\n00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.500\nmake it work like a stream.\n\n620\n00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:53.700\nThat's one of the key\nreasons why this may occur.\n\n621\n00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.330\nVery, very important to think about that,\n\n622\n00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:58.610\ngood observation in the sense that\nthis is the main reason we do this.\n\n623\n00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:00.310\nAll right, so let's take a look here,\nso what do we got?\n\n624\n00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:01.110\nWe have our IV, right?\n\n625\n00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:02.043\nWe know what that is now.\n\n626\n00:30:02.043 --> 00:30:05.040\nWe have our key, our block,\nright, we have our plain text.\n\n627\n00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:07.250\nWe have our XOR, we have our ciphertext.\n\n628\n00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:09.655\nThis looks a lot like what we saw before,\nright?\n\n629\n00:30:09.655 --> 00:30:14.528\nIf you think about it, this part right\nhere, except for the fact that plain text\n\n630\n00:30:14.528 --> 00:30:19.370\nis on the bottom, looks like what we\nwere just seeing with ECB and CBC.\n\n631\n00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:24.640\nWhen we looked at the ability\nto be able to do propagating\n\n632\n00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.500\ncipher feedback, we saw the two XORs.\n\n633\n00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:27.960\nSo it's not like two XORs.\n\n634\n00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:32.060\nBut what we saw just before, if we\nscroll up here for just a second, right?\n\n635\n00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:34.950\nSo if we come up here and we scroll, and\n\n636\n00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:40.170\nwe look at Cipher FeedBack mode right up\nhere, we see this exact diagram, right?\n\n637\n00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:44.880\nWe see this part is identical\nto the one we're looking at now,\n\n638\n00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:48.050\nexcept that we just see something\na little bit unusual going on over here.\n\n639\n00:30:48.050 --> 00:30:51.828\nSo as we scroll down, we're seeing\nthat this is very similar, right?\n\n640\n00:30:51.828 --> 00:30:55.350\nThis is very similar to CFB,\nCipher FeedBack.\n\n641\n00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:57.226\nBut what we're seeing here, and\n\n642\n00:30:57.226 --> 00:31:01.715\nit's really just nothing more than just\nthe angle of the [LAUGH] arrow, really.\n\n643\n00:31:01.715 --> 00:31:04.110\nCuz it's essentially gonna look the same.\n\n644\n00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:07.360\nThe only difference is that really what\nwe're saying here is with Output FeedBack\n\n645\n00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:12.160\nmode, we're gonna take this information,\nuse the output, use that as the IV,\n\n646\n00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:15.540\nthe Initialization Vector,\nand continue chaining.\n\n647\n00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:19.940\nAnd you can see this is essentially\na chain that pushes that output forward.\n\n648\n00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:23.144\nBut what we're doing is, you'll see,\nwe're chaining right here,\n\n649\n00:31:23.144 --> 00:31:25.335\nwe're chaining where we\ndo the plaintext XOR.\n\n650\n00:31:25.335 --> 00:31:27.307\nAnd we're pushing that forward, right?\n\n651\n00:31:27.307 --> 00:31:30.942\nSo it's just a matter of where\nwe integrate into the system,\n\n652\n00:31:30.942 --> 00:31:33.502\nwhere we're grabbing this from-\n&gt;&gt; The links?\n\n653\n00:31:33.502 --> 00:31:34.680\n&gt;&gt; And pushing it forward.\n\n654\n00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:38.200\nJust essentially the place we\nchoose to connect if you will.\n\n655\n00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:41.429\nBut the idea is that now we're operating\nas a stream because these bits are coming\n\n656\n00:31:41.429 --> 00:31:44.345\nout one at a time, and\nwe're pushing them forward continuously.\n\n657\n00:31:44.345 --> 00:31:46.435\nThis kinda looks like it is a block,\nright,\n\n658\n00:31:46.435 --> 00:31:48.295\nbecause we're talking about block cipher.\n\n659\n00:31:48.295 --> 00:31:52.134\nBut the reality is, is the bits drop out\nhere, we're pushing them continuously.\n\n660\n00:31:52.134 --> 00:31:56.306\nAnd as a result that's what we're getting,\nis we're XORing, we're XORing those bits\n\n661\n00:31:56.306 --> 00:31:59.978\none at a time, and that's the stream\nfunction We're pushing that through and\n\n662\n00:31:59.978 --> 00:32:01.555\nthat's what we then operate on.\n\n663\n00:32:01.555 --> 00:32:03.660\nSo it's kind of interesting\nthat we see that.\n\n664\n00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:05.150\nAnd then with OFB, that's what we see.\n\n665\n00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:09.120\nAnd then, like OFB, I told you the last\none, what's called the counter mode,\n\n666\n00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:12.590\nCTR mode,\nagain turns the block into a stream.\n\n667\n00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:16.430\nWe generate the next key stream block by\nencrypting successive values of a counter.\n\n668\n00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:20.270\nSo this is us iterating with\na numerical sequenced counter.\n\n669\n00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:21.950\nThe counter is initialized, right?\n\n670\n00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:26.220\nAs you can see, we're using a counter\nof all zeroes here to start.\n\n671\n00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:28.450\nAnd you can see, then we're moving to one,\nthen we're moving to two.\n\n672\n00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:32.930\nSo we're iterating as we go, and\nyou'll see we have the nonce, the random\n\n673\n00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:37.260\nchallenge, right, that is here combined\nwith the counter, that becomes the IV\n\n674\n00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:41.220\nthat goes through the system we get the\nplaintext text store, we get cypher text.\n\n675\n00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:43.600\nThis looks exactly like ECB,\n\n676\n00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.560\nthe very first time we did\nelectronic code booking, except for\n\n677\n00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:50.600\nthe fact that instead of nonce and\ncounter, we would have a plaintext appear.\n\n678\n00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:52.240\nRight, the plaintext would go up here.\n\n679\n00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.060\nIt would go up here, it would run through\nthe encryptor's system down here with\n\n680\n00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:58.010\nthe key and the cypher, and\nget ciphertext out the bottom.\n\n681\n00:32:58.010 --> 00:33:04.490\nSo this is like ECB, but it's ECB with a\nrandom challenge in nonce and the counter.\n\n682\n00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:08.170\nAnd then the counter iterating\nto create randomness as we go.\n\n683\n00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:11.070\nXOR with the plaintext to generate\nthe ciphertext at the bottom.\n\n684\n00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:15.920\nSo it has elements of ECB, but it adds\nthe unique counter that is gonna then\n\n685\n00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:20.970\nallow us to create the randomness we need\nas part of the confusion and diffusion.\n\n686\n00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:24.205\nThe challenge for the bad actor here,\nwould be we have no idea what the counter\n\n687\n00:33:24.205 --> 00:33:27.020\nsequence's at when it\nstarts how many rounds.\n\n688\n00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:30.230\nAnd as a result, we don't know\nwhat that randomness looks like\n\n689\n00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:32.170\nthat we have to work backwards to find.\n\n690\n00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:36.480\nYou think about the potential numerical\ncombinations that may exist here.\n\n691\n00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.100\nHow long, how many spots?\n\n692\n00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:40.690\nYou can see this one has, what did I do?\n\n693\n00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:41.580\nWe got two, four, six.\n\n694\n00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:44.540\nI'm thinking it's like eight or\nnine spots for the counter right?\n\n695\n00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:49.250\nAnd so if you think about it, if that\ncounter is ten sequence spaces long,\n\n696\n00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:53.210\nwe could have that number of\npossible numerical combinations.\n\n697\n00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:55.440\nSo we'd have to guess and\nwork through every one of them.\n\n698\n00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:59.140\nWe do have a finite number, but the idea\nwould be is it done in a reasonable amount\n\n699\n00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:03.980\nof time to find that particular item,\nwhatever that sequence counter is, that we\n\n700\n00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:07.750\nwould then have to use every round to go\nbackwards to be able to find the data.\n\n701\n00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:11.880\nVery hard to do, and the more or\nthe larger the space for the counter,\n\n702\n00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:13.200\nthe more spaces in other words,\n\n703\n00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:16.310\nthat potentially have to use,\nthe less likely it is we find this.\n\n704\n00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:19.130\nSo that's really one of the ways we\nsecure this that makes this possible.\n\n705\n00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:22.330\nWe don't use counter and\nwe don't use UFB very often.\n\n706\n00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:25.350\nWe don't tend to make blocks\nfrom streams all that often.\n\n707\n00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:27.920\nBut there are reasons why,\nas we talk about performance may be one.\n\n708\n00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:30.020\nAnd so we may see this occur.\n\n709\n00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:33.254\nBut cypher block chaining might be one of\nthe more common ones we tend to see with\n\n710\n00:34:33.254 --> 00:34:36.090\nthe block cypher it tends to work\nthat way more often than not.\n\n711\n00:34:36.090 --> 00:34:37.060\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n712\n00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:38.198\n&gt;&gt; Is that it?\n\n713\n00:34:38.198 --> 00:34:39.499\n&gt;&gt; I can make up\n&gt;&gt; Do we make.\n\n714\n00:34:39.499 --> 00:34:40.637\n&gt;&gt; Some other ther stuff.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, nope, I'm just--.\n\n715\n00:34:40.637 --> 00:34:41.650\n&gt;&gt; That's all the ones we gotta go to.\n\n716\n00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:45.350\n&gt;&gt; Cool, all right, that's it of\npart seven, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n717\n00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:48.550\nAnd thank you, Adam for joining us today,\nand thank you ladies and\n\n718\n00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:49.550\ngentlemen for tuning in.\n\n719\n00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:52.090\nBut we do have another chapter to cover,\nso stay tuned,\n\n720\n00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:54.420\nwe have more ECES headed your way.\n\n721\n00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:55.800\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n722\n00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:56.650\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam

00:00:08.220\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.017\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.017 --> 00:00:17.100\nAll right, greetings everyone and welcome\nto another exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.510\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.410\nAnd in today's' episode,\nwe are back with more of our ECES series.\n\n8\n00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.130\nThat's right, the EC-Council\nCertified Encryption Specialists.\n\n9\n00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.935\nAnd of course, joining us back in the\nstudio, yet again, our good friend, Mr.\n\n10\n00:00:30.935 --> 00:00:31.820\nAdam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:32.720\nAdam, welcome back, sir.\n\n12\n00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.820\nHow goes it today?\n\n13\n00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:34.480\n&gt;&gt; How goes it?\n\n14\n00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.180\nIt goes well, it goes well.\n\n15\n00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.880\nAnd hopefully it will go even better after\nwe get done talking a little bit more\n\n16\n00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.560\nabout not only encryption, but\n\n17\n00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.420\nspecifically about asymmetric encryption,\nright?\n\n18\n00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.340\nAlways an interesting topic.\n\n19\n00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.190\nWe spent, in our prior episodes,\na lot of time, Cherokee and I,\n\n20\n00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.980\ngoing through and\ntalking about symmetric encryption.\n\n21\n00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.070\nIf you haven't had a chance to take\na look at that symmetric cryptography,\n\n22\n00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.360\ndigital signatures.\n\n23\n00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.280\nRemind you about that.\n\n24\n00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.920\nEncourage you to go take a look,\ngot a whole series of episodes there.\n\n25\n00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.820\nWe're gonna go quick review of that.\n\n26\n00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.480\nDaniel agreed to act as my co-host/tour\nguide here, keep me on track.\n\n27\n00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna take a look\n\n28\n00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.130\nat some pictures here in a minute,\nand we're just going to quickly remind\n\n29\n00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.890\nourselves of what we did with\nsymmetric and digital signatures.\n\n30\n00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.150\nAnd then launch ourselves into\na discussion around asymmetric.\n\n31\n00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.920\nDaniel, if I ask you\nwhat we think probably\n\n32\n00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.050\nis the biggest difference between\nsymmetric and asymmetric cryptography.\n\n33\n00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.440\nWhat, from your perspective, in your mind,\n\n34\n00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.920\nwhat do you think would be\nprobably the biggest difference?\n\n35\n00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.070\n&gt;&gt; Probably the way\nthat they use the keys.\n\n36\n00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.540\nThere's a public and\na private key that are different.\n\n37\n00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.240\n&gt;&gt; The way that they use keys.\n\n38\n00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.222\nWe like visual aids here.\n\n39\n00:01:39.222 --> 00:01:39.879\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sure you brought some.\n\n40\n00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:40.400\nThese are actually kinda cool.\n\n41\n00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.800\n&gt;&gt; These are great, yeah.\n\n42\n00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.142\n&gt;&gt; So\nit is actually the way we use the keys.\n\n43\n00:01:44.142 --> 00:01:48.135\nWe're gonna talk about this, whether you\nhave a public key and-or private key, and\n\n44\n00:01:48.135 --> 00:01:49.865\nhow we go back and forth with those.\n\n45\n00:01:49.865 --> 00:01:52.205\nYou've seen me use these in\nsome of the other episodes.\n\n46\n00:01:52.205 --> 00:01:54.215\nWe're gonna play around with\nthem here a little bit as well.\n\n47\n00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:55.764\nBob and Alice are gonna join us again.\n\n48\n00:01:55.764 --> 00:01:57.636\nAlways like to have them\nsort of hanging out with us.\n\n49\n00:01:57.636 --> 00:01:58.755\n&gt;&gt; So kind of them.\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; They are so cool.\n\n50\n00:01:58.755 --> 00:02:01.317\nSo we're gonna have them take\na look at this with us as well.\n\n51\n00:02:01.317 --> 00:02:04.317\nWe're going to walk back through and\nit's exactly what Daniel said.\n\n52\n00:02:04.317 --> 00:02:06.027\nIt's the keys and how we use the keys.\n\n53\n00:02:06.027 --> 00:02:11.327\nAnd specifically, in symmetric it's\nthe use of single key or private key only,\n\n54\n00:02:11.327 --> 00:02:15.587\nversus in asymmetric the use of this key\npair that you were talking about and\n\n55\n00:02:15.587 --> 00:02:18.697\nhow we're then gonna make\nthose things work for us.\n\n56\n00:02:18.697 --> 00:02:23.057\nBut it's not just the public private key\nand it's not just, okay, I have both and\n\n57\n00:02:23.057 --> 00:02:24.120\nI use them.\n\n58\n00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.600\nIn asymmetric cryptography, it's\nthe subtlety of whose key gets used for\n\n59\n00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.420\nwhat particular event or\nwhat particular exchange.\n\n60\n00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.400\nAnd we're gonna delve into that and\nwe're gonna make sure we understand that.\n\n61\n00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.680\nCuz that really is the magic, right?\n\n62\n00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.410\nI mean, in theory, if you just say.\n\n63\n00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.760\nWell, I have two keys.\n\n64\n00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.720\nI'll use my private key, let's say,\nwhen I want to validate my identity.\n\n65\n00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.860\nI'll use my public key, when I wanna\nbe able to send something securely and\n\n66\n00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.100\nstore it, let's say, or\nput it somewhere so only I can see it.\n\n67\n00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.880\nThat's fine, but then what if you want\nto involve somebody in that exchange?\n\n68\n00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.100\nThen we got to be thinking\nabout not just our keys,\n\n69\n00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.470\nwe gotta be thinking about their keys.\n\n70\n00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.360\nAnd so we're to talk about that and\nhow all that works.\n\n71\n00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.140\nWe're gonna make sure we're\nready to go with that.\n\n72\n00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.120\nSo if we could take a look,\n\n73\n00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.440\njust some quick pictures,\nhelp us remember what we're doing here.\n\n74\n00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.352\nSo when we're thinking about\nsymmetric cryptography,\n\n75\n00:03:12.352 --> 00:03:16.853\nwe're thinking about the fact\nthat we are going to be\n\n76\n00:03:16.853 --> 00:03:21.970\nable to have the ability to be\nable to use our private key.\n\n77\n00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.790\nAnd we're gonna be able to,\nif we are Alice, let's say,\n\n78\n00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.030\nin this particular\ndiagram in our Exchange.\n\n79\n00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.730\nI woke up this morning,\nI kind of felt like Alice.\n\n80\n00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.735\nSo I thought I would\nbe Alice this morning.\n\n81\n00:03:31.735 --> 00:03:34.540\nI'm having a good hair day,\nas you can see, so I thought why not,\n\n82\n00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.830\nlet me be Alice.\n\n83\n00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:36.860\nYou wannna be Bob?\n\n84\n00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.370\n&gt;&gt; I'll be Bob.\n&gt;&gt; You're closer to no hair than I am.\n\n85\n00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.269\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've got a good Bob, right.\n\n86\n00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.792\n&gt;&gt; You've got a good Bob So we're gonna\nmake Daniel Bob in this particular\n\n87\n00:03:43.792 --> 00:03:46.170\nexchange, just so\nwe can kind of keep track of stuff.\n\n88\n00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.947\nSo if Alice is gonna be sending this\nmessage, yeah, whatever the data is,\n\n89\n00:03:48.947 --> 00:03:50.420\ndoesn't really matter.\n\n90\n00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.840\nAnd Alice wants to send it using, as you\ncould see up here, symmetric cryptography.\n\n91\n00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.282\nJust keep track of what we're doing,\nright?\n\n92\n00:03:56.282 --> 00:03:59.890\nSo she's gonna send this message\nusing symmetric or single key,\n\n93\n00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.150\nprivate key only cryptography.\n\n94\n00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.150\nThen this is Alice's\nprivate key right here, and\n\n95\n00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.180\nwhat's gonna happen is, Alice will\nuse the key to encrypt the data.\n\n96\n00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.350\nSo she will apply either confidentiality\nor integrity protections or both.\n\n97\n00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.950\nSo she'll either encrypt the data or\nshe will use the key to be able to\n\n98\n00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.940\nvalidate her identity through the ability\nto be able to digitally sign.\n\n99\n00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.772\nIn this case, we are not going to\ndigitally sign using symmetric\n\n100\n00:04:26.772 --> 00:04:28.867\ncryptography, but we are going to encrypt.\n\n101\n00:04:28.867 --> 00:04:31.740\nSo we'll apply\nconfidentiality protections.\n\n102\n00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.149\nSo we'll encrypt the data and Alice\nwill use her private key to do that, and\n\n103\n00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:36.518\nshe will send it over to Bob.\n\n104\n00:04:36.518 --> 00:04:40.160\nBob is gonna get that data, hopefully,\nand be able to interact with it.\n\n105\n00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.320\nSo, if I was to send\nthe data over to Daniel,\n\n106\n00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.290\nhe would get the encrypted bits and\nbe able to look at the message,\n\n107\n00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.050\nbut he couldn't really read the message,\nunderstand it, in its current form.\n\n108\n00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.480\nThis is the thing we talk about, right?\n\n109\n00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.860\nWhen we apply\nthe confidentiality protections,\n\n110\n00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.540\nwhat we get is an encrypted\nrepresentation of the data.\n\n111\n00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.030\nSo we go from plain text, through the\ncrypto system, applying the algorithm and\n\n112\n00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.830\nthe key.\n\n113\n00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.410\nAnd we, on the back end,\nwind up with what's called cipher text.\n\n114\n00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.690\nAnd we've talked about this in\nour definition discussions and\n\n115\n00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.790\nour use of the vocabulary along the way,\n\n116\n00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.750\nthrough all the different episodes\nwe've been through up until this point.\n\n117\n00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.840\nAnd so now,\nBob is the recipient of the cipher text.\n\n118\n00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.420\nBut the problem is that when Bob gets\nthe cipher text, he has no way of\n\n119\n00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:29.030\nunderstanding the true nature of the data\nunless along with the cipher text,\n\n120\n00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.770\nhe has somehow received a copy of the key\nthat would allow him to unlock or\n\n121\n00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.320\nread by deciphering, unencoding, and\n\n122\n00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.310\nconverting the cipher text back to\nplain text, the data that Alice sent.\n\n123\n00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.030\nThe data could be something as simple as\nBob, make sure you log on at 10 o'clock so\n\n124\n00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.540\nwe can have our conference call.\n\n125\n00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.080\nMaybe she's inviting him out for lunch.\n\n126\n00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.610\nMaybe she's sending him a recipe.\n\n127\n00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.080\nWe don't really know what it is.\n\n128\n00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.160\nDoesn't really matter.\n\n129\n00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.000\nWhatever it is, it's important and\n\n130\n00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.060\nit's important enough that Alice\nwanted to protect the data\n\n131\n00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.210\nby actually encrypting it to keep it\nsecret from our attacker down here.\n\n132\n00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.990\nHe's kind of lurking.\n\n133\n00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.480\nNow actually go back to half screen.\n\n134\n00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.471\nThat was kinda cool because we could\nsay the attacker's kind of lurking.\n\n135\n00:06:08.471 --> 00:06:08.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hiding, right,\n\n136\n00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.140\nthat's actually kind of neat.\n\n137\n00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.191\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; When we do that.\n\n138\n00:06:11.191 --> 00:06:12.616\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; So it's actually kind of pointing\n\n139\n00:06:12.616 --> 00:06:13.831\ntoward you, so that's kind of fun.\n\n140\n00:06:13.831 --> 00:06:14.364\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n141\n00:06:14.364 --> 00:06:15.992\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because eventually you wanna get it.\n\n142\n00:06:15.992 --> 00:06:16.682\nSee, it's actually right.\n\n143\n00:06:16.682 --> 00:06:18.670\nIt's pointing towards me\nbecause I really am not Alice.\n\n144\n00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:19.845\nI'm masquerading as Alice.\n\n145\n00:06:19.845 --> 00:06:21.115\nI'm really the attacker.\n\n146\n00:06:21.115 --> 00:06:21.840\nYou've uncovered my masquerade here.\n\n147\n00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.875\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n148\n00:06:23.875 --> 00:06:27.775\nSo you could see that I am kind\nof hiding the attacker partially,\n\n149\n00:06:27.775 --> 00:06:30.005\njust because the screen is\ncovering our attacker dude.\n\n150\n00:06:30.005 --> 00:06:33.915\nOur attacker dude out there, our little\nattacker person down on the corner.\n\n151\n00:06:33.915 --> 00:06:35.675\nBut the attacker is always lurking, right?\n\n152\n00:06:35.675 --> 00:06:37.365\nWe know they're always\nout there somewhere.\n\n153\n00:06:37.365 --> 00:06:39.615\nThey're always looking to do harm.\n\n154\n00:06:39.615 --> 00:06:41.295\nAnd in this exchange,\n\n155\n00:06:41.295 --> 00:06:45.970\nas we talk asymmetric cryptography,\nthe idea here is that we have a challenge.\n\n156\n00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.010\nAnd this challenge is not the hey,\n\n157\n00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:49.970\nlet's keep it secret from\nthe attacker challenge.\n\n158\n00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.110\nWe always have that.\n\n159\n00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:56.470\nBut the big challenge Alice faces and\nBob faces here is how do we securely\n\n160\n00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:02.310\ntransmit Alice's private key using this,\nwhatever this pathway is, right down here.\n\n161\n00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.650\nHow do we get the key to Bob so that\nway Bob can interact with the message,\n\n162\n00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:07.790\nunderstand it.\n\n163\n00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:11.690\nAnd perhaps, conversely, if we go the\nother way, how would Bob send his private\n\n164\n00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.080\nkey to Alice cuz maybe Bob\nwants to respond and do that.\n\n165\n00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.390\nAnd as a result, going back and forth,\nwe would have some issues here.\n\n166\n00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:23.510\nAnd this is where the attacker can\nactually jump in potentially and can\n\n167\n00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:29.430\ninteract to perhaps bring risk into the\nmixture and execute some sort of attack.\n\n168\n00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.763\nBecause the attacker most likely\ncan get the encrypted message.\n\n169\n00:07:32.763 --> 00:07:35.100\nThat's what this dotted line represents.\n\n170\n00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.438\nThe attacker down here\nbeing able to steal or\n\n171\n00:07:37.438 --> 00:07:40.978\nsomehow take off the top through\nsome sort of network monitoring or\n\n172\n00:07:40.978 --> 00:07:44.279\nsome sort of masquerade or\nspoof attack or whatever it may be.\n\n173\n00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:47.750\nMan in the middle,\nthere's all these different ways to do it.\n\n174\n00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:50.397\nThat the attacker may get\naccess to the encrypted bits.\n\n175\n00:07:50.397 --> 00:07:53.284\nHighly likely that that\ncan probably happen and\n\n176\n00:07:53.284 --> 00:07:58.191\nto be honest with you as a security\nprofessional, as an encryption specialist,\n\n177\n00:07:58.191 --> 00:08:03.169\nas an ethical hacker, whatever we, you\nmay be Whatever security we think about,\n\n178\n00:08:03.169 --> 00:08:05.287\nhowever we approach management.\n\n179\n00:08:05.287 --> 00:08:09.955\nWe're not as concerned about giving up the\nencrypted data as we are about protecting\n\n180\n00:08:09.955 --> 00:08:10.488\nthe key.\n\n181\n00:08:10.488 --> 00:08:13.764\nAnd, quite honestly, and\nI tell my customers this all the time, and\n\n182\n00:08:13.764 --> 00:08:14.453\nmy students.\n\n183\n00:08:14.453 --> 00:08:18.440\nI'm not concerned about the attacker\ngetting the encrypted data.\n\n184\n00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.201\nIf we've done our job correctly,\n\n185\n00:08:20.201 --> 00:08:24.771\nwe've applied the proper confidentiality\nprotections, and they're strong enough.\n\n186\n00:08:24.771 --> 00:08:27.984\nI'm not actually overly concerned,\nneither should you be,\n\n187\n00:08:27.984 --> 00:08:29.605\nabout the data being exposed.\n\n188\n00:08:29.605 --> 00:08:34.560\nBecause getting the confidential data\ndoesn't really do the attacker any good,\n\n189\n00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:37.890\nunless they can find the key and\nun-encrypt the data.\n\n190\n00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:41.640\nNow, is it possible they\ncould brute-force the data?\n\n191\n00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.450\nGet lucky,\n\n192\n00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:46.240\ntry enough keys over enough time that\nmaybe they will find the right key?\n\n193\n00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.000\nAnything is possible.\n\n194\n00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.590\nWe never say, beyond a reasonable doubt,\n\n195\n00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:52.400\nthat there is a guarantee that\nwe will never decrypt that data.\n\n196\n00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:56.615\nBut what we say is, it's highly\nunlikely in a reasonable amount of time\n\n197\n00:08:56.615 --> 00:08:59.745\nthat that data could be\ndecrypted by an attacker.\n\n198\n00:08:59.745 --> 00:09:02.886\nReasonable is a kind of sponge-y,\nstretch-y term, right.\n\n199\n00:09:02.886 --> 00:09:06.295\nIf we have a standard, let's say,\nseven-year retention period for\n\n200\n00:09:06.295 --> 00:09:09.083\nbusiness data,\nat least in the United States, anyway.\n\n201\n00:09:09.083 --> 00:09:11.520\nThen we would say, perhaps,\nif that's our policy,\n\n202\n00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.242\nthat the encryption has to hold up for\nat least seven years.\n\n203\n00:09:14.242 --> 00:09:16.801\nBecause, after that,\nwe're going to destroy the data.\n\n204\n00:09:16.801 --> 00:09:18.687\nAnd once we destroy the data,\nand once we destroy the data,\n\n205\n00:09:18.687 --> 00:09:19.986\nchances are good that it's worthless.\n\n206\n00:09:19.986 --> 00:09:21.930\nAt that point, it's meaningless anyway.\n\n207\n00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.610\nAnd if somebody were to\ndecrypt it in eight, nine,\n\n208\n00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:27.090\nten years,\nit would no longer have any value.\n\n209\n00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:30.510\nSo, we have to figure out\nwhat our retention period is.\n\n210\n00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:34.266\nWe have to figure out what the protection\nvalue of that data will be.\n\n211\n00:09:34.266 --> 00:09:36.005\nHow long does it have to be protected?\n\n212\n00:09:36.005 --> 00:09:37.700\nUnder what conditions?\n\n213\n00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.080\nIs it going to be in deep storage?\n\n214\n00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.480\nEssentially like archival storage,\nsomething like that.\n\n215\n00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.420\nIs it actively being used every day?\n\n216\n00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:45.690\nIs it in the cloud?\n\n217\n00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:50.000\nIs it in a situation where\nwe've bit split it, so\n\n218\n00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.820\nessentially chunked the data,\nstored it in multiple places?\n\n219\n00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.390\nYou have to bring all the pieces\nback together to be able to\n\n220\n00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:56.730\nreconstitute the data.\n\n221\n00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.042\nDo we have multiple copies of that data?\n\n222\n00:09:59.042 --> 00:10:01.585\nThere are a lot of variables that\nwill go into this conversation.\n\n223\n00:10:01.585 --> 00:10:05.570\nBut generically, we're not as\nconcerned about you, as the attacker,\n\n224\n00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:08.066\nbeing able to get\nthe actual encrypted data.\n\n225\n00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:09.780\nIf we've done our job correctly.\n\n226\n00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:10.948\nThis is a big deal.\n\n227\n00:10:10.948 --> 00:10:13.922\nBecause the trick with\napplying cryptography and\n\n228\n00:10:13.922 --> 00:10:15.911\nconfidentiality protections.\n\n229\n00:10:15.911 --> 00:10:20.790\nIs figuring out how to do it in such a way\nthat it stands up to the test of time.\n\n230\n00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:24.810\nBut also, and equally importantly,\nunderstanding that that's not a one and\n\n231\n00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:26.340\ndone kind of situation.\n\n232\n00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:30.460\nWe don't apply the protection,\ndrop the proverbial microphone, or\n\n233\n00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.800\nin this case the proverbial encryption\nkey and say, okay, we're done.\n\n234\n00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.820\nI can do that right here\nas a matter of fact.\n\n235\n00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:39.330\nI can say, okay, I applied\nthe encryption and I'm done, right?.\n\n236\n00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:40.630\nThat's the one and done kind of thing.\n\n237\n00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:42.360\nIt wasn't as dramatic as\nI thought it would be.\n\n238\n00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.360\nI thought it would be cooler.\n\n239\n00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.470\n&gt;&gt; You don't get a cool mic drop.\n\n240\n00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:48.050\n&gt;&gt; But we need that noise, so\nif I did that, we need the dropping noise.\n\n241\n00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:48.580\nOkay ready?\n\n242\n00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:49.790\nAll right, let's try it again.\n\n243\n00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:50.382\nSo I'm done.\n\n244\n00:10:50.382 --> 00:10:52.825\n[SOUND] See, that's, right.\n\n245\n00:10:52.825 --> 00:10:54.199\nSir, you are a genius.\n\n246\n00:10:54.199 --> 00:10:55.777\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, awesome.\n\n247\n00:10:55.777 --> 00:10:58.910\nAll right, so when we do that,\nright, it's not enough to say that.\n\n248\n00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:01.878\nBecause, when we do that,\nwe don't circle back.\n\n249\n00:11:01.878 --> 00:11:06.245\nIf we don't assess the validity,\nthe protection, of that control,\n\n250\n00:11:06.245 --> 00:11:09.882\ncountermeasure control,\nin other words, encryption.\n\n251\n00:11:09.882 --> 00:11:13.800\nIf we don't look at how strong that is,\nand is it still relevant?\n\n252\n00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.200\nAre we still applying the proper\nstrength of control for\n\n253\n00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.200\nthe duration of the retention period\nthroughout the retention period?\n\n254\n00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:25.280\nIf we're not assessing on a regular basis,\nwe probably have applied\n\n255\n00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.860\nan encryption solution that may or\nmay not be strong enough.\n\n256\n00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:29.520\nIt may be weak.\n\n257\n00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.280\nWe don't know.\n\n258\n00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.650\nMaybe today, it's good.\n\n259\n00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:34.602\nBut what about a year from now,\nwhat about two months from now,\n\n260\n00:11:34.602 --> 00:11:36.171\nwhat about seven years from now?\n\n261\n00:11:36.171 --> 00:11:39.565\nIn other words, what I'm\nsuggesting is as IT professionals,\n\n262\n00:11:39.565 --> 00:11:42.775\nas security professionals,\nas encryption specialists.\n\n263\n00:11:42.775 --> 00:11:45.366\nAs a lot of you will hopefully want to be.\n\n264\n00:11:45.366 --> 00:11:50.262\nYou have to understand that this is an\nongoing conversation in the business with\n\n265\n00:11:50.262 --> 00:11:52.758\nAlice and Bob, our proverbial actors.\n\n266\n00:11:52.758 --> 00:11:54.969\nAgainst our threat source, our bad actor,\n\n267\n00:11:54.969 --> 00:11:58.520\nour little attacker lurking\nat the bottom of the diagram.\n\n268\n00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.380\nThat attacker is always present.\n\n269\n00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.230\nThat attacker is ever patient.\n\n270\n00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:04.040\nThat attacker is ever vigilant.\n\n271\n00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.432\nThey're never going away.\n\n272\n00:12:05.432 --> 00:12:09.320\nThey're gonna be there all the time,\nwaiting for the opportunity to pounce.\n\n273\n00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:13.296\nWhat we have to do as Alice and/or Bob,\nright?\n\n274\n00:12:13.296 --> 00:12:17.081\nWhat we have to do is we have to ensure\nthat our protection, our controls,\n\n275\n00:12:17.081 --> 00:12:18.313\nour counter measures.\n\n276\n00:12:18.313 --> 00:12:22.889\nOur confidentiality solution that\nwe apply either through symmetric,\n\n277\n00:12:22.889 --> 00:12:26.950\ndigital signature, hashing,\nand or asymmetric encryption.\n\n278\n00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:31.672\nIs not only strong today, not only strong\ntomorrow, but is strong today, tomorrow,\n\n279\n00:12:31.672 --> 00:12:33.090\nand for everyday.\n\n280\n00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:36.890\nIn that retention policy chain,\nuntil that data has been\n\n281\n00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:40.540\nat the end of its life cycle,\nproperly disposed of, whenever that is.\n\n282\n00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.713\nThere's data that may be maintained for\nweeks, months, years.\n\n283\n00:12:43.713 --> 00:12:47.717\nThere's data, in many businesses,\nthat will sit around for\n\n284\n00:12:47.717 --> 00:12:50.880\nmuch longer than the average\nretention period.\n\n285\n00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:54.664\nBecause nobody's applied proper\ndocument management controls to it and\n\n286\n00:12:54.664 --> 00:12:56.610\nwe just leave it laying around.\n\n287\n00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:58.420\nThink about the stuff you\nput on your laptop, right?\n\n288\n00:12:58.420 --> 00:12:58.940\nMost of us do.\n\n289\n00:12:58.940 --> 00:12:59.470\nAll of us do.\n\n290\n00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:00.480\nAll of you do.\n\n291\n00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:05.340\nI've got documents on my laptop that are\nthere from the time I started the laptop,\n\n292\n00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:07.430\nessentially when I started gathering data.\n\n293\n00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:08.270\nYou've seen my desktop.\n\n294\n00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:09.180\nYou know what that looks like.\n\n295\n00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:12.169\n&gt;&gt; It's scary.\n&gt;&gt; From that time till now.\n\n296\n00:13:12.169 --> 00:13:13.241\nAnd that data may or\n\n297\n00:13:13.241 --> 00:13:18.084\nmay not be under changed management and/or\nretention policy control in a business.\n\n298\n00:13:18.084 --> 00:13:19.784\nBecause it's typically personal data,\nright?\n\n299\n00:13:19.784 --> 00:13:22.557\nIt's stuff that I may create,\nthat you may create.\n\n300\n00:13:22.557 --> 00:13:26.615\nThat may not necessarily fall into\nthe category of corporate data,\n\n301\n00:13:26.615 --> 00:13:30.755\ncorporate intellectual property\nthat may be managed with a policy.\n\n302\n00:13:30.755 --> 00:13:34.742\nAnd although we haven't talked about\nit here, in many of our other shows and\n\n303\n00:13:34.742 --> 00:13:36.995\nconversations and other security areas.\n\n304\n00:13:36.995 --> 00:13:41.026\nIn CISSP, in certified ethical hacking,\nin CHFI and\n\n305\n00:13:41.026 --> 00:13:45.424\nforensic examination,\nin incident handling, in SSCP.\n\n306\n00:13:45.424 --> 00:13:47.358\nI could go down the list it's\nlike alphabet soup, right?\n\n307\n00:13:47.358 --> 00:13:51.075\nIn any or all of those things,\nwe've talked about the value of policy.\n\n308\n00:13:51.075 --> 00:13:55.902\nAnd the need to have high-level direction\nfrom senior management that tells us\n\n309\n00:13:55.902 --> 00:13:57.711\nwhy we're doing something.\n\n310\n00:13:57.711 --> 00:14:01.843\nWhat we need to accomplish, and\ntranslating that into process and\n\n311\n00:14:01.843 --> 00:14:02.664\nprocedure.\n\n312\n00:14:02.664 --> 00:14:08.012\nGoing from strategic to operational to\ntactical execution to manage that flow and\n\n313\n00:14:08.012 --> 00:14:11.585\nthat outcome that we're looking for\nin the business.\n\n314\n00:14:11.585 --> 00:14:15.038\nRight, this is what policy,\nprocess, and procedure does.\n\n315\n00:14:15.038 --> 00:14:19.529\nAs a result, we need to be thinking\nabout the fact that applying encryption,\n\n316\n00:14:19.529 --> 00:14:21.891\napplying cryptographic protections.\n\n317\n00:14:21.891 --> 00:14:26.998\nApplying these counter measures to\na system only gets us through the door.\n\n318\n00:14:26.998 --> 00:14:31.098\nBut what we do on the other side,\nhow long that control is good for,\n\n319\n00:14:31.098 --> 00:14:33.457\nhow relevant it is, how strong it is.\n\n320\n00:14:33.457 --> 00:14:38.794\nAnd how much longevity it will have to\nafford us the level of protection we need,\n\n321\n00:14:38.794 --> 00:14:42.150\nthat is an ongoing\nconversation that is dynamic.\n\n322\n00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:44.740\nIt's shifting all the time,\nbecause those bad actors,\n\n323\n00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:49.470\nthose attackers are waiting to use\nthe latest technology that's out there.\n\n324\n00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:52.846\nAnd are gonna bring that to bear\nagainst our problem, which is,\n\n325\n00:14:52.846 --> 00:14:56.109\ncan they steal Alice's private\nkey as we were talking about?\n\n326\n00:14:56.109 --> 00:14:59.436\nAnd when they do that, if they find\na way to do that that's novel,\n\n327\n00:14:59.436 --> 00:15:00.537\nthat is innovative.\n\n328\n00:15:00.537 --> 00:15:04.398\nThat has not been thought through as part\nof the protection that we've applied,\n\n329\n00:15:04.398 --> 00:15:06.520\nthey may actually find a weakness, right?\n\n330\n00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:11.050\nA vulnerability, as we say, that may be\npresent that we have not accounted for.\n\n331\n00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:13.290\nAnd remember,\nwe don't know about all the risks.\n\n332\n00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:14.980\nWe don't know about all\nthe vulnerabilities.\n\n333\n00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:17.630\nA lot of them have been identified and\nwe know what they are.\n\n334\n00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:20.880\nAlgorithms that are proved to be weak\nshould be discontinued and not used.\n\n335\n00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:23.860\nDES, as we've talked about,\nis a good example of this.\n\n336\n00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:27.890\nAs of 2000, 2001,\nwe no longer are supposed to use DES for\n\n337\n00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:29.560\nhighly secure communications.\n\n338\n00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:33.760\nWe've replaced that, as we've talked\nabout in other conversations, with AES,\n\n339\n00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.360\nthe Advanced Encryption Standard.\n\n340\n00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:40.830\nA newer algorithm, stronger, allowing us\nto afford better protection over time.\n\n341\n00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:45.390\nBut, will something eventually lead\nus to understand that AES may be\n\n342\n00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:48.310\nweakened to the point that it could\nbe compromised in the future?\n\n343\n00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:48.960\nNo doubt about it.\n\n344\n00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.216\nDo I know when that will be?\n\n345\n00:15:50.216 --> 00:15:52.600\nNo idea, but\nI know that if we wait long enough and\n\n346\n00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:56.903\nwe get back together here in, I don't\nknow, five, ten, 20, 30 years We will,\n\n347\n00:15:56.903 --> 00:15:59.078\nI'll probably have a lot\nless hair by then.\n\n348\n00:15:59.078 --> 00:16:01.191\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But we will know, and\n\n349\n00:16:01.191 --> 00:16:05.690\nwe will be able to understand that at some\npoint, something will have to replace AES.\n\n350\n00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:07.610\nIt's inevitable,\nit's only a matter of time.\n\n351\n00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:09.080\nAnd so as a result,\n\n352\n00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:13.550\nif we're not constantly assessing that,\nwe're not doing our jobs correctly.\n\n353\n00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:15.960\nSo let's go back to the diagram,\njust so that we understand that, and\n\n354\n00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:16.820\nwe have sense of that.\n\n355\n00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:20.440\nOur attacker is lurking up there\nat the edge of the screen.\n\n356\n00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:25.060\nAnd what we see is that Alice has sent\nthe data as we said, Bob has received it.\n\n357\n00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.710\nBut if the attacker can either grab\n\n358\n00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:32.950\nthe encrypted bits with the upper\nright-hand most red-dotted line arrow,\n\n359\n00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:35.160\nthey've got half the information\nthey need, as we said.\n\n360\n00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.870\nWhat we really need,\nwhat the attacker wants,\n\n361\n00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:42.220\nthe attacker wants to be\nable to get the message.\n\n362\n00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:46.419\nBut the attacker really then, also needs\nto get a copy of Alice's private key and\n\n363\n00:16:46.419 --> 00:16:50.391\nthat's why we have the two arrows\ncircling down here towards the attacker.\n\n364\n00:16:50.391 --> 00:16:52.424\nBecause if the attacker gets both,\n\n365\n00:16:52.424 --> 00:16:56.626\nthen the attacker is able to not only\ndecrypt this message transmission,\n\n366\n00:16:56.626 --> 00:17:00.770\nbecause they can certainly at\nthat point read Alice's message.\n\n367\n00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:06.010\nBut they can decrypt every message that\nAlice has ever sent using this key.\n\n368\n00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:09.430\nAnd this is the other part of this that\nreally becomes problematic for us.\n\n369\n00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:14.070\nBecause if Alice doesn't change her key\noften, chances are good there's a lot of\n\n370\n00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:17.970\ndata that's been used and\nsent and received with this key.\n\n371\n00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:20.730\nAnd all of those communications\nmay become suspect and\n\n372\n00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:22.360\nthat's gonna be a major problem.\n\n373\n00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:23.380\nNot just for Alice, but for\n\n374\n00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:26.720\nBob and, in theory, anybody else that\nAlice has been communicating with.\n\n375\n00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:30.050\nWe may have other people that are not\nrepresented on the diagram in other words.\n\n376\n00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:33.570\nAnd remember, in symmetric encryption,\n\n377\n00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:37.970\nit's rare that we change out the private\nkey because Kirchhoff's principle,\n\n378\n00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:41.330\nwhich we've talked about in many of\nour episodes reminds us of the fact\n\n379\n00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:45.390\nthat the private key needs to be kept\nsecure and we need to think about that.\n\n380\n00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:49.004\nBut what Kirchhoff is implying, although\nwe don't come right out and say it is,\n\n381\n00:17:49.004 --> 00:17:52.035\nhey, if you even have the slightest\nsuspicion that that private key\n\n382\n00:17:52.035 --> 00:17:55.675\nhas been compromised, you should change\nit out because it's no longer secret.\n\n383\n00:17:55.675 --> 00:17:59.405\nBut we don't often change out private\nkeys, we tend to leave them in place,\n\n384\n00:17:59.405 --> 00:18:01.154\nbecause we don't tend to assume and\n\n385\n00:18:01.154 --> 00:18:04.564\nthink very often about the fact that\nthey may have been compromised.\n\n386\n00:18:04.564 --> 00:18:08.832\nAnd this is something we just have to\nconsider, because if we swap out those\n\n387\n00:18:08.832 --> 00:18:13.575\nprivate keys, if Alice's key is cycled\nevery 90 days, then even if the attacker\n\n388\n00:18:13.575 --> 00:18:18.387\ngets that key, there's very limited window\nof the amount of data that that attacker\n\n389\n00:18:18.387 --> 00:18:22.955\nmay be able to compromise as a result\nof getting access to that key.\n\n390\n00:18:22.955 --> 00:18:26.765\nAnd this is one of those compensation\ncontrols, one of those coping mechanisms.\n\n391\n00:18:26.765 --> 00:18:28.170\nYou can call it different things.\n\n392\n00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:32.446\nBut this is one of the strategies\nthat smart IT professionals,\n\n393\n00:18:32.446 --> 00:18:37.288\nsmart security professionals,\ncertified encryption specialists,\n\n394\n00:18:37.288 --> 00:18:40.677\npeople that understand not\njust the mechanics but\n\n395\n00:18:40.677 --> 00:18:45.517\nthe overarching needs of the entire\nsystem and the policy, process and\n\n396\n00:18:45.517 --> 00:18:49.009\nprocedures that go into\nmaking a secure Exchange.\n\n397\n00:18:49.009 --> 00:18:51.583\nAnd the oversight,\nthe governance, risk and\n\n398\n00:18:51.583 --> 00:18:54.610\ncompliance controls that\nneed to be in place.\n\n399\n00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:57.260\nWe talked about due care and\ndue diligence a lot.\n\n400\n00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:01.240\nYou bring all these things to bear and\nit's not enough to equal, hey,\n\n401\n00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:04.130\nlet's keep those key static and\nnever, ever change them.\n\n402\n00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:06.120\nIt actually pushes you in\nthe opposite direction.\n\n403\n00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:11.580\nIt says hey, Mr. and Mrs. ECES, Mr.\nand Mrs. certified encryption specialist.\n\n404\n00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:16.460\nYou should be the one advocating for key\nrotation, you should be modifying those\n\n405\n00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:20.760\nkeys and changing them out and\nnot reusing them on a regular basis.\n\n406\n00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:24.260\nBecause if you do that, you're implying\nthat you understand that there's\n\n407\n00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:27.310\na likelihood that attacker\ncould be successful.\n\n408\n00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:30.730\nAnd by the way there's nothing wrong\nwith admitting that the attacker\n\n409\n00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:33.220\nat a certain point in time may gain and\nadvantage.\n\n410\n00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:35.550\nThat's actually a very smart thing for\n\n411\n00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:38.300\na security professional to think about and\nto say.\n\n412\n00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:42.901\nI can be better than the attacker but only\nfor so long, because at some point I'm\n\n413\n00:19:42.901 --> 00:19:47.638\neither gonna do something that's gonna\nopen up a weakness or a vulnerability, or\n\n414\n00:19:47.638 --> 00:19:52.307\nthe attacker is gonna find a pathway in\nthat I have not understood, documented,\n\n415\n00:19:52.307 --> 00:19:53.155\nand managed.\n\n416\n00:19:53.155 --> 00:19:56.346\nAnd understood how to defend against,\nbecause nobody knew it was there.\n\n417\n00:19:56.346 --> 00:19:58.710\nCall these,\nzero-day exploits all the time.\n\n418\n00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:04.880\nAs a result of that, if I'm honest with\nmyself as a security professional.\n\n419\n00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.550\nIf I admit that I'm not\ngonna be perfect and\n\n420\n00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:11.170\nif I admit that it is highly\nlikely that if I leave\n\n421\n00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:15.730\na solution in place long enough,\nsomebody will find a way to break it.\n\n422\n00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:17.920\nI should be smarter than that.\n\n423\n00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.690\nSmarter than the average\nbear is we used to say.\n\n424\n00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:25.420\nSo if you wanna be smart, admit that\nyou're not gonna be perfect forever.\n\n425\n00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:28.260\nAdmit that you are likely\nto make a mistake.\n\n426\n00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:33.860\nProactively manage against that outcome\nand validate that that compromise\n\n427\n00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:38.050\nis not gonna occur unless you go really\nfar out of your way to make multiple\n\n428\n00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:43.460\nmistakes by taking one of the most obvious\npathways in away from the attacker.\n\n429\n00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.670\nTake away the ability to chip\naway at that transmission and\n\n430\n00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:50.250\nget that private key because\nit stays in place long enough.\n\n431\n00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:54.620\nRemember the warning that WEP shows us and\nillustrates for us.\n\n432\n00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:57.410\nSo we've talked about WEP before,\nwe'll talk about it again.\n\n433\n00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:00.480\nBut the fact that the key space was so\nsmall.\n\n434\n00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.370\nRemember the key space.\n\n435\n00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:03.470\nThe number of possible permutations or\n\n436\n00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:07.700\ncombinations of all keys available\nthat can be used to encrypt.\n\n437\n00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:13.390\nIf that key space is small, or\nrelatively speaking is small, the number\n\n438\n00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:16.700\nof keys pulled out of the pool is small\nenough that somebody can try them all in\n\n439\n00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:21.130\na reasonable amount of time, they get\nthe key whether or not you want them to.\n\n440\n00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:23.510\nAnd you've gotta understand,\nthat no matter how good you are,\n\n441\n00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:27.580\nif they want it badly enough,\nis gonna try to be better than you.\n\n442\n00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.730\nAdmit that, understand that, embrace that.\n\n443\n00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:33.800\nI tell my students and my customers\nall the time, you're not hiring me,\n\n444\n00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:37.190\nand you're not asking me to teach you,\nbecause I'm better than you.\n\n445\n00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:39.770\nYou're asking me to do work for\nyou, you're asking me to teach you,\n\n446\n00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:42.690\nbecause I can show you how\nto be as good as you can be.\n\n447\n00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:45.640\nSo that you can defend yourself and\nyou can figure\n\n448\n00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:50.070\nout how to be better than an attacker for\na period of time, but not forever.\n\n449\n00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:52.200\nBecause there is no such thing as forever.\n\n450\n00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.875\nWell the diamond people tell you there is.\n\n451\n00:21:53.875 --> 00:21:55.530\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's a lie, it's not true.\n\n452\n00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:56.610\nYou ever see Red?\n\n453\n00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:59.610\nThis is a random aside by the way.\n\n454\n00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:02.200\nGood to have you back by\nthe way as well because,\n\n455\n00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.100\nI love doing shows with Cherokee, also.\n\n456\n00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:07.310\nBut Cherokee just doesn't have the movie\nknowledge that you and I share.\n\n457\n00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:08.870\n&gt;&gt; Everybody's got their thing.\n\n458\n00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:11.430\n&gt;&gt; We've flipped over to music a little\nbit cuz she seems to be a little bit\n\n459\n00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:12.660\nbetter off with the music stuff.\n\n460\n00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:13.990\nBut I'm trying to educate her.\n\n461\n00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:16.350\nWe are trying to get her\nto watch more movies.\n\n462\n00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:19.060\nBut have you ever seen those episodes,\nnot movies, by the way.\n\n463\n00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:21.280\nIt's like a YouTube, web show kinda thing.\n\n464\n00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.600\nThe guy's name is Adam,\nwhich is kind of funny.\n\n465\n00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:29.094\nBut where he goes in and he takes apart-\n&gt;&gt; Adam ruins anything\n\n466\n00:22:29.094 --> 00:22:30.417\n&gt;&gt; Adam ruins everything, exactly.\n\n467\n00:22:30.417 --> 00:22:31.737\nSo have you seen any of those?\n\n468\n00:22:31.737 --> 00:22:33.091\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So have you seen the one he does on\n\n469\n00:22:33.091 --> 00:22:34.920\nthe De Beers and diamonds?\n\n470\n00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:35.470\n&gt;&gt; I have not.\n\n471\n00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:40.790\n&gt;&gt; If you have not watched Adam Ruins\nEverything, go out and Google for this.\n\n472\n00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:42.710\nYou'll see them on YouTube or\nwhatever they are.\n\n473\n00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:43.660\n&gt;&gt; Very entertaining.\n\n474\n00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:48.100\n&gt;&gt; They're awesome, but it's this guy who\nessentially takes these cherished myths,\n\n475\n00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.840\nlike diamonds are forever,\nand how great it is to\n\n476\n00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:56.890\nbuy your significant other a diamond to\nget engaged or whatever the case may be.\n\n477\n00:22:56.890 --> 00:23:02.060\nAnd he goes in and he essentially\njust tears this thing up and\n\n478\n00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:05.060\nshows you just the total inanity and\n\n479\n00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:08.470\nthe absolute ridiculousness that's\ninvolved in these urban myths.\n\n480\n00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:09.830\nAnd he takes one of them.\n\n481\n00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:13.230\nHe takes on this whole idea that you've\ngotta buy a diamond to get engaged.\n\n482\n00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:16.350\nAnd this is why, and historically\nwe've always done it this way.\n\n483\n00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:18.170\nSo this is just what you do.\n\n484\n00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:21.010\nSo be the sheep and just,\nyou know, blindly follow along.\n\n485\n00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:25.800\nAfter you watch this, if you have not\ngotten engaged yet and you're about to,\n\n486\n00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.350\nyou're never ever gonna look\nat this the same way again.\n\n487\n00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:30.500\nSo it's an awesome series, it really is.\n\n488\n00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:33.140\nBut he does some phenomenal stuff,\nwith all these different things.\n\n489\n00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:35.720\nBut the one on diamonds in particular,\nis just like,\n\n490\n00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:39.210\nyou basically find out it's just nothing\nmore than just an absolute marketing hype\n\n491\n00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:42.005\nthat the diamond people created, so\nthat they would be able to sell diamonds.\n\n492\n00:23:42.005 --> 00:23:42.550\nThat's all it was.\n\n493\n00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:45.590\n&gt;&gt; My favorite one was the one he did\nabout the lady that burned herself with\n\n494\n00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:47.080\nthe McDonald's coffee.\n\n495\n00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:50.480\nNot probably went down the way\nyou think it went down.\n\n496\n00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.653\nVery interesting history to that story.\n\n497\n00:23:53.653 --> 00:23:55.863\n&gt;&gt; That one I have not seen,\nI'll have to check that one out.\n\n498\n00:23:55.863 --> 00:23:57.156\nBut I've seen several of them.\n\n499\n00:23:57.156 --> 00:24:00.607\nEvery one I've seen has just been\nBetter than the last one, it's built,\n\n500\n00:24:00.607 --> 00:24:01.395\nit's awesome.\n\n501\n00:24:01.395 --> 00:24:04.960\nAll right, so anyway, now that we're\nback so let's go back to that diagram.\n\n502\n00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.814\nWe've been talking about symmetric, and\n\n503\n00:24:06.814 --> 00:24:10.119\nremember the theme of our episode here\nstarting now is asymmetric, right?\n\n504\n00:24:10.119 --> 00:24:13.780\nWe're just reviewing the background\nhere to get us up to asymmetric, but\n\n505\n00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:16.921\nI wanted to make sure we're clear\non the concept of symmetric.\n\n506\n00:24:16.921 --> 00:24:20.776\nWhy this exchange is important but\nthe challenge associated with it,\n\n507\n00:24:20.776 --> 00:24:23.651\nwhich is transmission of\nthe private key securely so\n\n508\n00:24:23.651 --> 00:24:25.957\nthe attacker cannot get the private key.\n\n509\n00:24:25.957 --> 00:24:29.854\n&gt;&gt; We'll call this Adam ruins symmetric\n&gt;&gt; Adam ruins [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK].\n\n510\n00:24:29.854 --> 00:24:32.340\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nlet's talk about digital signatures now.\n\n511\n00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:36.180\nSo what we can see here is\nthat we have our hashing,\n\n512\n00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:38.070\ndigital signature hashing discussion.\n\n513\n00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:40.930\nWe have this in the symmetric\nepisodes as well.\n\n514\n00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:42.670\nWe have Alice on the left there.\n\n515\n00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:47.140\nShe is sending, as you can see with\nthe big arrow arching over the top,\n\n516\n00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:51.280\na copy of her public key is being used or\nbeing sent somehow to Bob.\n\n517\n00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:52.800\nIt's probably available for download.\n\n518\n00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.440\nBob can find it on the web.\n\n519\n00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.940\nWho knows how he gets it,\nbut it's available.\n\n520\n00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:56.720\nIt's public, right?\n\n521\n00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:57.890\nWe give it out.\n\n522\n00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:02.280\nWhen we digitally sign,\nwe are using asymmetric solutions.\n\n523\n00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.400\nWe are using a public-private key pair,\nand\n\n524\n00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.590\nthe idea is that we're\ngonna have two keys.\n\n525\n00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:09.800\nWe're gonna keep, remember\nKerckhoffs' principle, one secure.\n\n526\n00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.160\nIn this case,\nthe private key is the red key, right?\n\n527\n00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.270\nSo we labeled it here so we could see it.\n\n528\n00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:16.040\nSo Alice's private key.\n\n529\n00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.085\nAlice's public key.\n\n530\n00:25:18.085 --> 00:25:22.650\nWe're gonna send a message to Bob,\nbut we are digitally signing it.\n\n531\n00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:26.730\nWe are validating the authenticity\nthrough proof of origin, and\n\n532\n00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:29.160\nthrough nonrepudiation of this message.\n\n533\n00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:33.800\nAlice is claiming that she sent it, and\nBob has to believe that, because it is\n\n534\n00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:39.160\nhighly unlikely that Alice did not send\nit, because of the use of her private key.\n\n535\n00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:44.160\nBecause when she signs the message\ncreating the hash value what\n\n536\n00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:47.250\nwe would call in this case a message\ndigest, cuz that's what the signature is\n\n537\n00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:51.510\ncalled when we attach it to a message and\nsend it via email, let's say.\n\n538\n00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:54.030\nCall it a message digest,\nor a digital signature.\n\n539\n00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:56.080\nThere's all these names we refer to it as.\n\n540\n00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:01.440\nBut when she uses the hash value to\nrepresent the integrity of the message,\n\n541\n00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:06.610\nand provide the proof of origin and\nnon repudiation,\n\n542\n00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:12.880\nthen what she's doing, she's essentially\ncertifying that her private key was used.\n\n543\n00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:17.399\nAnd because her private key was used, and\nif Kerckhoffs's principle holds true that\n\n544\n00:26:17.399 --> 00:26:21.340\nthe private key should never be exposed,\nthe logic in the solution is.\n\n545\n00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.960\nWell, if nobody but\nAlice knows her private key,\n\n546\n00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:28.170\nthen Alice could have really been the only\nuser who should have been able to do this.\n\n547\n00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:29.630\nNow, that may or may not be true,\n\n548\n00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:33.720\nas I pointed out in our conversations\naround this, because we make assumptions.\n\n549\n00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:37.460\nBut we also know, right, that when we make\nassumptions sometimes we assume correctly.\n\n550\n00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:39.580\nOther times, not so much, right?\n\n551\n00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:44.730\nAnd so the problem becomes that what we\nreally know when Alice digitally signs\n\n552\n00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:46.180\nthis message is.\n\n553\n00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:47.270\nAnd what we can validate and\n\n554\n00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:50.870\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt,\nis that Alice's private key was used.\n\n555\n00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:55.263\nBut what we don't really know is\nwhether Alice was the person that was\n\n556\n00:26:55.263 --> 00:26:58.909\nactually going in and\ndoing the signing and the sending.\n\n557\n00:26:58.909 --> 00:27:03.148\nOr was it somebody impersonating Alice\nwho has pretended to be her, but\n\n558\n00:27:03.148 --> 00:27:04.994\nhas access to her private key.\n\n559\n00:27:04.994 --> 00:27:08.136\nAnd that's why the attacker down\nhere is in our diagram, right,\n\n560\n00:27:08.136 --> 00:27:11.792\nbecause the attacker may be able to get\na copy of Alice's private key as we see\n\n561\n00:27:11.792 --> 00:27:13.527\nthrough this exchange right here.\n\n562\n00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:17.220\nAnd if the attacker does that,\nand then we,\n\n563\n00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:22.063\nsay the attacker is actually impersonating\nAlice, digitally signing the message.\n\n564\n00:27:22.063 --> 00:27:26.099\nBob will validate the message by looking\nat the public, private key pair,\n\n565\n00:27:26.099 --> 00:27:30.690\nusing Alice's public key to validate\nthe private key in the signature.\n\n566\n00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:32.460\nThat will come back,\nding, ding, ding, right?\n\n567\n00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:35.480\nThat will come back and\nshow positive, and show that yes,\n\n568\n00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.610\nindeed, Alice's private key\nwas used to digitally sign.\n\n569\n00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:41.250\nBut what we don't really see and\nwhat we have no way of knowing,\n\n570\n00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:45.530\nis that the attacker deployed Alice's\nprivate key in that exchange,\n\n571\n00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:47.690\nbecause he or\nshe was able to get a copy of it.\n\n572\n00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:52.050\nIn other words, there's no guarantee\nbeyond a reasonable doubt here\n\n573\n00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:56.600\nof the fact that Alice was\nthe actual physical person\n\n574\n00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:00.430\nwho did the actual sending and\nor signing and sending.\n\n575\n00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:05.383\nBut rather only we could certify beyond\na reasonable doubt through proof of origin\n\n576\n00:28:05.383 --> 00:28:10.122\nand non-repudiation that Alice's private\nkey was used to digitally sign and\n\n577\n00:28:10.122 --> 00:28:12.590\nsend this message on her behalf.\n\n578\n00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:16.500\nAnd this is a subtle but really important\npoint that we often don't pick up on,\n\n579\n00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:20.050\nbecause we often don't spend\nthe time to dissect this and\n\n580\n00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:25.770\nreally think about the fact that without\nadditional factors of authentication.\n\n581\n00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:28.310\nSo this is essentially\na single factor solution.\n\n582\n00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:32.971\nWe're using a attributable private key\nthat's only known to the holder, right?\n\n583\n00:28:32.971 --> 00:28:36.250\nSo something you know,\nsomething you have, something you are,\n\n584\n00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:40.180\nthese are the three factors of\nauthentication we often speak about.\n\n585\n00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:42.840\nWell, something you know or\nsomething you have.\n\n586\n00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.640\nYou could refer to this\nin either category,\n\n587\n00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.900\ndepending on how you would classify it.\n\n588\n00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:49.790\nBut typically we would say a private\nkey is something you have,\n\n589\n00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:51.670\nbecause you possess it, right?\n\n590\n00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:55.210\nAnd it's stored somewhere, so\nyou have knowledge of it, yes.\n\n591\n00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:59.230\nBut you would typically be said to\npossess it, and therefore you have it.\n\n592\n00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:00.990\nSo if we say this is something we have and\n\n593\n00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:05.420\nyou use this, then the problem\nbecomes we're only using one factor.\n\n594\n00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:08.790\nAnd that one factor could be\nclaimed by more then one actor.\n\n595\n00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:09.688\nThis is the challenge.\n\n596\n00:29:09.688 --> 00:29:14.023\nIf we add a second or\na third factor to this, making a dual or\n\n597\n00:29:14.023 --> 00:29:18.045\nmulti-factor authentication,\nwe add complexity, and\n\n598\n00:29:18.045 --> 00:29:21.565\nthe likelihood is going to go up,\nthat it really is Alice,\n\n599\n00:29:21.565 --> 00:29:25.495\nbecause she would have to validated\nher identity using multiple forms.\n\n600\n00:29:25.495 --> 00:29:30.485\nAnd the likelihood goes down that it's the\nthreat actor, the bad actor doing this,\n\n601\n00:29:30.485 --> 00:29:36.230\nbecause the likelihood of the attacker,\nthe threat actor having access to two or\n\n602\n00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:42.030\neven three forms or\nfactors of authentication is less likely.\n\n603\n00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:44.350\nEvery time we add another factor,\nit becomes less and\n\n604\n00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:47.470\nless likely that the attacker\nwill be able to claim all three,\n\n605\n00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:49.770\nespecially if we use something you are.\n\n606\n00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:53.310\nA biometric identification\nmechanism as part of that.\n\n607\n00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:56.866\nSome biometric identification mechanisms\nstronger than others clearly, right, so\n\n608\n00:29:56.866 --> 00:29:57.750\nwe want to know that.\n\n609\n00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:58.660\nBe aware of that.\n\n610\n00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:01.550\nBut, if we add in, could we go\nback to diagrams just a second?\n\n611\n00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:06.480\nIf we add in over here, the ability for\nAlice to use something she has,\n\n612\n00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.530\nher private key.\n\n613\n00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:11.800\nAnd we say in addition, we want\nAlice to be able to do a retina scan\n\n614\n00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:16.020\nas a biometric identification marker,\nto validate that this is really her\n\n615\n00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:20.390\nbefore we allow the digital signature to\nbe applied, and for her to send to Bob.\n\n616\n00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:23.680\nIf we do that, then it is so\n\n617\n00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:28.000\nunlikely that the attacker would be able\nto meet both thresholds, both criteria,\n\n618\n00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.610\nboth controls being able to certify and\npass through both tests.\n\n619\n00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:36.630\nHe may be able or she may be able to get\nthe private key, but almost impossible for\n\n620\n00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:40.250\nher or\nhim as an attacker to spoof a retina scan.\n\n621\n00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:42.860\nAlthough if you've seen Minority Report\nyou know that's not necessarily\n\n622\n00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:43.690\nthe case, right?\n\n623\n00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:46.910\nBut the reality is, it's very unlikely.\n\n624\n00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:51.300\nAnd as a result of that, we would\nprobably feel a lot more comfortable\n\n625\n00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:55.400\ncertifying the fact that when Bob\nvalidates Alice's private key\n\n626\n00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:59.570\nwith the public key match here to match\nthe signature, prove the identity.\n\n627\n00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:03.970\nThat we could really put a check mark\nthere and say yeah, that is Alice sending,\n\n628\n00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:07.650\nas well as Alice's proof of origin,\nthe non-repudiation.\n\n629\n00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:11.210\nAlice did definitely send it, and\nwe can prove and attribute it to her.\n\n630\n00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:12.040\nThat would be part of that.\n\n631\n00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:14.740\n&gt;&gt; I would love to see\nthe risk matrix chart\n\n632\n00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:16.715\nof Alice having her eye\nremoved by the attacker.\n\n633\n00:31:16.715 --> 00:31:18.380\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So there is a possibility, right?\n\n634\n00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:19.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right, it's possible.\n\n635\n00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:23.050\n&gt;&gt; I'm not saying it's unlikely,\nI'm just saying it is highly unlikely.\n\n636\n00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:25.120\n&gt;&gt; That impact is gonna be high though.\n\n637\n00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that is.\nThat's gonna be a wow,\n\n638\n00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.170\nthat really hurts, right?\n\n639\n00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:30.880\nSo it's going to be high risk and\ncertainly high impact, but\n\n640\n00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:35.350\nthe reality is is it likely that\nperhaps the attacker finds Alice,\n\n641\n00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:38.070\nholds her hostage,\nsomehow threatens her, and\n\n642\n00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:43.030\nmakes her use her retina or her iris\nagainst a reader, against her will?\n\n643\n00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:45.486\nLook, there's always that possibility,\nno doubt about it.\n\n644\n00:31:45.486 --> 00:31:49.971\nBut what we're suggesting is, it becomes\na lot more difficult for the attacker to\n\n645\n00:31:49.971 --> 00:31:54.066\norchestrate that, and the timing and\nall that coming together so that he or\n\n646\n00:31:54.066 --> 00:31:58.304\nshe could pretend essentially to be\nAlice in this exchange, very unlikely.\n\n647\n00:31:58.304 --> 00:31:59.895\nAlthough it would be kind\nof cool to watch, right?\n\n648\n00:31:59.895 --> 00:32:00.749\n&gt;&gt; Makes for a great movie.\n\n649\n00:32:00.749 --> 00:32:04.420\n&gt;&gt; If we could animate this,\nlike have the attacker walk up.\n\n650\n00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:07.814\nYou know, put her up against\nthe reader and then send it to Bob,\n\n651\n00:32:07.814 --> 00:32:09.238\nthat would be kinda cool.\n\n652\n00:32:09.238 --> 00:32:12.237\nThat's gonna be like gen 2\nof our diagramming software.\n\n653\n00:32:12.237 --> 00:32:16.290\nAll right, so we've done the digital\nsignature slash hashing, right?\n\n654\n00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:17.940\nWe've done the symmetric.\n\n655\n00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:21.350\nLet's quickly take a look at asymmetric so\nwe can set the tone for\n\n656\n00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:25.110\nthe upcoming conversations, and the rest\nof our episodes here around this theme.\n\n657\n00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:28.505\nBut we really wanted to do a good\nthorough review of this and a look ahead,\n\n658\n00:32:28.505 --> 00:32:32.088\nwith the pictures, to give you a better\nsense of what we're gonna be doing.\n\n659\n00:32:32.088 --> 00:32:35.500\nSo we could see all three\ntogether in one location.\n\n660\n00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:36.682\nSo let's go back,\nlet's take a look if we could.\n\n661\n00:32:36.682 --> 00:32:41.545\nWe are gonna go ahead here and\nwe are gonna go the other way.\n\n662\n00:32:41.545 --> 00:32:44.030\n[LAUGH] All right,\nI never do know my left from my right,\n\n663\n00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:45.480\nI'm always confused about that.\n\n664\n00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:48.040\nSo now we have asymmetric\ncryptography being applied here.\n\n665\n00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:50.568\nAnd so what we see again, Bob and Alice.\nAnd what we have is Alice being\n\n666\n00:32:50.568 --> 00:32:55.440\nable to again send some sort of\nmessage over to Bob as you can see.\n\n667\n00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.880\nAnd we have a private key in red,\nthere's private key on both sides.\n\n668\n00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.700\nWe have our attacker down here.\n\n669\n00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:04.660\nWe have Alice's public key, and\nwe can see Bob has his public key as well.\n\n670\n00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:07.170\nSo each of them has what's\ncalled a key pair, right?\n\n671\n00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:10.510\nAnd so the key pair made up of two keys,\npublic private.\n\n672\n00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:12.860\nAnd the idea is that we talked about this\nat the beginning of the episode right,\n\n673\n00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:13.761\nas we were getting into this.\n\n674\n00:33:13.761 --> 00:33:15.580\nWhose key is being used?\n\n675\n00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:20.280\nNot just what key, but now it's a question\nof which key it's a question of whose key?\n\n676\n00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:22.430\nSo now we have two variables\nwe have to keep track of here.\n\n677\n00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:23.546\nAnd this is where it gets interesting,\nright?\n\n678\n00:33:23.546 --> 00:33:27.186\nBecause the logical obvious choice\nis not always the one we may use and\n\n679\n00:33:27.186 --> 00:33:29.750\nthis why we gotta pay attention to things.\n\n680\n00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:33.560\nSo the first thing we have to establish\nis who is gonna be sending and\n\n681\n00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:35.120\nwho's gonna be receiving, right?\n\n682\n00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:41.825\nSo if Alice was to use her public key\nto be able to somehow send this data.\n\n683\n00:33:41.825 --> 00:33:45.176\nThe only key that could correspond and\nvalidate the identity and\n\n684\n00:33:45.176 --> 00:33:47.450\nunencrypt would be her private key.\n\n685\n00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:51.640\nWhich would be fine if we were\ndoing this in a way that nobody but\n\n686\n00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:54.500\nAlice needed to see the message, and\nnobody had knowledge of her key.\n\n687\n00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:58.403\nBut we know from our discussion\nsymmetric Encryption,\n\n688\n00:33:58.403 --> 00:34:01.800\nthat Perchov says, hey, keep the private\nkey secured don't give it away.\n\n689\n00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:02.700\nSo, the problem becomes,\n\n690\n00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:06.130\nif she uses her public key, everybody\nhas to have a copy of her private key.\n\n691\n00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:08.120\nThat's really not going to make sense.\n\n692\n00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:12.395\nIf she uses her private key,\nand sends the message.\n\n693\n00:34:12.395 --> 00:34:16.095\nAnybody with a copy of her public key,\nwhich could be anybody, would be able to\n\n694\n00:34:16.095 --> 00:34:20.445\nread the message, which affords no\nconfidentiality protection whatsoever,\n\n695\n00:34:20.445 --> 00:34:22.635\nwhich obviously proves\na challenge as well.\n\n696\n00:34:22.635 --> 00:34:26.645\nBecause if we're trying to send this\nsecure way that is gonna be kept secret,\n\n697\n00:34:26.645 --> 00:34:29.665\nthere's no value in allowing everybody in\nthe world to get a copy of the key and\n\n698\n00:34:29.665 --> 00:34:30.750\nread the message.\n\n699\n00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:35.345\nNow there may be, if Alice just actually\nwants to send a message to everybody and\n\n700\n00:34:35.345 --> 00:34:38.101\nshe wants to validate that she sent it,\nright?\n\n701\n00:34:38.101 --> 00:34:42.400\nSo if we in theory are looking to perhaps\ndigitally sign, right, and validate,\n\n702\n00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:44.680\nthen that may actually make sense.\n\n703\n00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:46.120\nBut we're not looking to do that.\n\n704\n00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:50.160\nWe're looking to apply cryptographic\nprotection that focus on confidentiality\n\n705\n00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:51.280\nin this conversation.\n\n706\n00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:56.210\nAnd as a result, Alice wants to send that\ndata securely to Bob, keep it secret, and\n\n707\n00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:58.500\nnot allow anybody else but Bob to read it.\n\n708\n00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:02.280\nRemember we have our attacker lurking\ndown here just waiting right?\n\n709\n00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:06.434\nLook at that suspicious kind of beady look\non that attacker's non extensive face.\n\n710\n00:35:06.434 --> 00:35:07.548\n&gt;&gt; Very shady [LAUGH].\n\n711\n00:35:07.548 --> 00:35:08.420\n&gt;&gt; Right non existant face.\n\n712\n00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:10.510\nSo, the attackers patiently waiting.\n\n713\n00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:11.780\nSo this is a challenge, right?\n\n714\n00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:14.820\nSo, if Alice uses either of her keys,\n\n715\n00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:16.690\nsounds like we're not\ngonna have a solution.\n\n716\n00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:18.720\nSo now we gotta figure out who's key.\n\n717\n00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.218\nWell clearly we know,\nwe're gonna go over to Bob, right?\n\n718\n00:35:20.218 --> 00:35:23.516\nBut who's key we're gonna use,\nbut not just who's key, but\n\n719\n00:35:23.516 --> 00:35:26.540\nwhich key in the key pair\nare we going to use, right?\n\n720\n00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:28.082\nBecause we know,\nif we go and say okay, Bob,\n\n721\n00:35:28.082 --> 00:35:29.513\nwe're gonna need to use one of your keys.\n\n722\n00:35:29.513 --> 00:35:34.458\nSo that Alice can send to you securely.\n\n723\n00:35:34.458 --> 00:35:37.920\nBob will be like,\nall right well I guess that makes sense.\n\n724\n00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:40.340\nBut remember,\nI can't give away my private key,\n\n725\n00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:42.560\nI've got no way to transmit that securely.\n\n726\n00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.720\nSo you can't really use my private key.\n\n727\n00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:47.830\nSo the only key left\nmust be Bob's public key.\n\n728\n00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:49.660\nSo we're gonna use Bob's public key.\n\n729\n00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:50.520\n&gt;&gt; Aptly named.\n\n730\n00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:51.443\n&gt;&gt; Aptly named.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n731\n00:35:51.443 --> 00:35:54.851\n&gt;&gt; BPK, Bob's Public Key.\n\n732\n00:35:54.851 --> 00:35:58.740\nSo when we use Bob's public key,\nthe challenge now becomes okay,\n\n733\n00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:00.358\nlet's move it over here, give it to Alice.\n\n734\n00:36:00.358 --> 00:36:05.140\nSo we could see that, but how does Alice\nactually get a copy of Bob's public key?\n\n735\n00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:07.668\nWell public keys are surprisingly enough,\npublic right?\n\n736\n00:36:07.668 --> 00:36:10.918\nSo they are available,\ntypically they are key servers, so\n\n737\n00:36:10.918 --> 00:36:13.330\nmay be we can get them\nthrough the internet.\n\n738\n00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:17.505\nLets say, you can typically go get one or\ndownload it, If you are in the directory,\n\n739\n00:36:17.505 --> 00:36:20.249\nso maybe Bob and\nAlice are both in an organization, and\n\n740\n00:36:20.249 --> 00:36:22.116\nthey share an common LDAP provider.\n\n741\n00:36:22.116 --> 00:36:26.400\nA domain controller or\nan open LDAP server whatever case maybe.\n\n742\n00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:30.160\nThose public keys are made available\nthrough the LDAP directory.\n\n743\n00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:34.160\nSo Alice may be able to go request\na copy of Bob's public key from the LDAP\n\n744\n00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.160\nprovider.\n\n745\n00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:38.620\nAnd remember, it's not Alice that's\nactually going to make the request.\n\n746\n00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:41.660\nIt's the software that Alice\nis doing to send the data.\n\n747\n00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:44.780\nIf this is an email then\nemail it's the email program.\n\n748\n00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:47.130\nIt's Outlook, it's Sendmail.\n\n749\n00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:48.670\nWhatever it may be.\n\n750\n00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:52.900\nIt's the software that's doing\nthe requesting, and the gathering, and\n\n751\n00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:54.740\nthe applying of the keys.\n\n752\n00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:59.030\nWe're just essentially typing in the bits,\nwe're pushing some buttons, right.\n\n753\n00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:04.100\nYou're specifying I want a signature, I\nwant to encrypt, I want this, I want that.\n\n754\n00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:06.580\nIt's you know,\nessentially a menu-driven solution, right?\n\n755\n00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:07.670\nWhen we think about it.\n\n756\n00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:09.835\nSo while we say we have to go out and\nget Bob's public key.\n\n757\n00:37:09.835 --> 00:37:14.303\nWhat we really are saying is we have to\nhave access to a key server that will\n\n758\n00:37:14.303 --> 00:37:17.765\nallow us to download and\nget a copy of Bob's public key.\n\n759\n00:37:17.765 --> 00:37:21.830\nAnd then, use that public\nkey as part of the process.\n\n760\n00:37:21.830 --> 00:37:25.730\nSo Alice will incorporate that\ninto her thought process.\n\n761\n00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:28.850\nAnd so,\nAlice has got a copy of Bob's public key.\n\n762\n00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:32.680\nAnd she now uses Bob's public\nkey to encrypt the message, and\n\n763\n00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:34.920\nsend it securely to Bob.\n\n764\n00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.454\nWell we know, based on the thought\nprocess of the key pair,\n\n765\n00:37:37.454 --> 00:37:41.067\nthat because the keys are mathematically\nrelated to one another, public private.\n\n766\n00:37:41.067 --> 00:37:46.220\nThat if one key is used to encrypt,\nthe other key is used to decrypt.\n\n767\n00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:49.390\nEach key has a specific function and so.\n\n768\n00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:54.290\nIf Bob's public key is used to encrypt,\nthen the only corresponding key that can\n\n769\n00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:59.010\nbe used to decrypt, would be Bob's\nmatching key pair, his private key.\n\n770\n00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:03.258\nIf Kerckhoffs principle holds secure\nhere and indeed is applied, and\n\n771\n00:38:03.258 --> 00:38:06.861\nthere is no way that that private\nkey has been compromised.\n\n772\n00:38:06.861 --> 00:38:09.715\nThen the only recipient who\ncan see that message, and\n\n773\n00:38:09.715 --> 00:38:13.240\ndecrypt it would be Bob with\nhis corresponding private key.\n\n774\n00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.690\nNow, the attacker has been\npatiently waiting down here.\n\n775\n00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:16.831\nWe probably should bring them in.\n\n776\n00:38:16.831 --> 00:38:17.907\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; At least,\n\n777\n00:38:17.907 --> 00:38:20.595\ngive them the opportunity to\ndo something here, right?\n\n778\n00:38:20.595 --> 00:38:22.798\nSo where would the attacker\ninsert themselves?\n\n779\n00:38:22.798 --> 00:38:27.656\nWhere in this conversation could\nthe attacker become either a force to\n\n780\n00:38:27.656 --> 00:38:32.020\nbe reckoned with,\ncould they get in there to do some harm?\n\n781\n00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:33.310\nOr could they cause mischief?\n\n782\n00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:36.620\nWell, the goal would be to get\na copy of not just one, but\n\n783\n00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:38.671\nmostly likely both private keys.\n\n784\n00:38:38.671 --> 00:38:41.790\nBecause remember,\nthis may be a bidirectional exchange.\n\n785\n00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:46.888\nBob, although, we haven't diagrammed it\nhere may choose to respond back to Alice.\n\n786\n00:38:46.888 --> 00:38:49.099\nHe would have to get a copy\nof Alice's public key, so\n\n787\n00:38:49.099 --> 00:38:51.074\nwe would have an exchange\ngoing the other way.\n\n788\n00:38:51.074 --> 00:38:57.340\nAnd Bob would send the message back to\nAlice encrypting it using her public key.\n\n789\n00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:01.250\nAnd, allowing only her with her\ncorresponding key pair private key\n\n790\n00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:02.880\nto read the message.\n\n791\n00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:07.780\nAnd as a result of that, if the attacker\nwas able to somehow gain, copies, and\n\n792\n00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:12.050\nknowledge of both private keys, knowing\nthat the public keys are available.\n\n793\n00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:14.570\nThey could,\nin theory be gotten very easily.\n\n794\n00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:16.880\nThey would have both key pairs.\n\n795\n00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:19.510\nNot only could they read and\ndecrypt the messages, but\n\n796\n00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:22.030\nthey actually could impersonate Bob or\nAlice.\n\n797\n00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:26.390\nAnd send as Bob and Alice's as well,\nif they got a copy of both the public and\n\n798\n00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:27.320\nthe private key.\n\n799\n00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:30.401\nSo at a minimum they would like to\nget the private keys to decrypt, but\n\n800\n00:39:30.401 --> 00:39:33.819\nthe attacker would most likely want to\nactually gain access to the key pair.\n\n801\n00:39:33.819 --> 00:39:37.344\nBecause then they can impersonate\nthe individual in both directions,\n\n802\n00:39:37.344 --> 00:39:40.270\nwhich would become much\nmore impactful obviously.\n\n803\n00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:42.344\nAnd so\nwhen we think about asymmetric encryption.\n\n804\n00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:46.690\nWe're thinking about the fact\nthat we are using a key pair,\n\n805\n00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:49.360\nmathematically related keys, so they are.\n\n806\n00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:51.320\nRemember the Wonder Twins on\nthe Justice League of America?\n\n807\n00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:52.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n808\n00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:52.990\nRight?\n\n809\n00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:54.335\nAnd then the crazy monkey Gleek?\n\n810\n00:39:54.335 --> 00:39:55.283\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, remember?\n\n811\n00:39:55.283 --> 00:39:56.767\n&gt;&gt; Shape of, form of, right?\n\n812\n00:39:56.767 --> 00:39:59.165\nSo when we have our key pair, right?\n\n813\n00:39:59.165 --> 00:40:02.282\nOur public and private keys\nTrying to standardize those and\n\n814\n00:40:02.282 --> 00:40:04.846\nhold them the way that they\nshow up on the screen.\n\n815\n00:40:04.846 --> 00:40:07.340\nI'm so directionally challenging like-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n816\n00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:08.280\n&gt;&gt; Horizontally and\n\n817\n00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:10.130\nvertically challenged it's just not funny.\n\n818\n00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:12.840\nIt's amazing I'm able to stand up\nright I'm walking a regular basis.\n\n819\n00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:16.120\nSo you could see that when I hold\nthese up, I have a key pair, right?\n\n820\n00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:19.010\nAnd if I keep my private key,\nlet's say the gold one is private,\n\n821\n00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:23.420\nI keep the private key secure and\nI use only my silver key.\n\n822\n00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:28.340\nMy public key to be able to as we saw,\nprovide the ability to somebody to grab my\n\n823\n00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:32.828\nkey and send me a secure message then\nyou want to help me out of here sir.\n\n824\n00:40:32.828 --> 00:40:36.631\nWhen Daniel wants to send me a message,\nwhat's Daniel gonna do?\n\n825\n00:40:36.631 --> 00:40:41.391\nDaniel is gonna reach and grab a copy of\nmy public key, right, he's gonna take that\n\n826\n00:40:41.391 --> 00:40:46.120\npublic key, he's gonna use it to encrypt\nthe message and send it back to me.\n\n827\n00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:49.130\nAnd so when he does that,\nthank you very much, right?\n\n828\n00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:52.979\nWhen he does that, when he sends me,\nlet's try that one more time.\n\n829\n00:40:52.979 --> 00:40:55.424\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I forgot to give him the message.\n\n830\n00:40:55.424 --> 00:40:56.021\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n831\n00:40:56.021 --> 00:40:57.285\n&gt;&gt; I almost sent him the key.\n\n832\n00:40:57.285 --> 00:40:59.905\nSo when he does that,\nhe's gonna send it back to me.\n\n833\n00:40:59.905 --> 00:41:00.705\nLook at that.\n\n834\n00:41:00.705 --> 00:41:04.515\nThere's the message encrypted\nwith my public key.\n\n835\n00:41:04.515 --> 00:41:08.575\nWhat key do I have to use\nto unlock that encryption?\n\n836\n00:41:08.575 --> 00:41:10.596\nTurn it in the lock.\nI have to use my public key,\n\n837\n00:41:10.596 --> 00:41:12.904\nis gonna be the transport mechanism.\n\n838\n00:41:12.904 --> 00:41:19.220\nI have to use my private key to be able\nto unencrypt and read the message.\n\n839\n00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:22.740\nAnd when I've done that I'm the only one\nin theory if that's done the right way\n\n840\n00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:24.540\nthat should be able to do that, right.\n\n841\n00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:29.304\nAnd so we wanna make sure we\nunderstand the importance of asymmetric\n\n842\n00:41:29.304 --> 00:41:34.154\ncryptography which is the additional\nkey affording us the ability to\n\n843\n00:41:34.154 --> 00:41:38.251\nextend our connection to somebody and\nswap public keys for\n\n844\n00:41:38.251 --> 00:41:42.784\nthe successful,\nsecure communication of encrypted traffic.\n\n845\n00:41:42.784 --> 00:41:46.013\nCertifying that only the private\nkey holder of the key pair,\n\n846\n00:41:46.013 --> 00:41:50.510\nassuming Perchov's principle is indeed\nbeing applied properly, should be able to\n\n847\n00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:55.100\nread the traffic, because everybody else\nwon't have a copy of the private key.\n\n848\n00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:57.630\nThis is the strength of\nthe asymmetric system.\n\n849\n00:41:57.630 --> 00:42:01.200\nThis is why it is considered and\nwidely used today, and has been used for\n\n850\n00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:04.070\ndecades to be the most efficient and\n\n851\n00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:08.890\ntherefore most secure way of transmitting\ndata when we are using a system\n\n852\n00:42:08.890 --> 00:42:11.550\nthat involves has being able to send and\nreceive between two people.\n\n853\n00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:14.732\nIf all we wanna do is symmetrically\nencrypt data for long-term storage\n\n854\n00:42:14.732 --> 00:42:18.284\nas the owner or the custodian, being the\nonly person who will gain access to it,\n\n855\n00:42:18.284 --> 00:42:21.804\nsymmetric encryption with a private key\nonly solution, makes a lot of sense.\n\n856\n00:42:21.804 --> 00:42:25.746\nCuz I don't have to worry about\ntransmitting the key, I just have to worry\n\n857\n00:42:25.746 --> 00:42:29.140\nabout having access to it to open\nup the data when I wanna see it.\n\n858\n00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:32.005\nAnd we talked about in the symmetric\nencryption discussions,\n\n859\n00:42:32.005 --> 00:42:35.303\nthat symmetric encryption is much\nfaster then asymmetric encryption,\n\n860\n00:42:35.303 --> 00:42:37.300\ncuz it's only using a single key.\n\n861\n00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:41.750\nSo we talked about the fact we would bulk\nencrypt data using symmetric encryption.\n\n862\n00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:45.480\nAnd then, because asymmetric\nencryption is typically slower\n\n863\n00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:50.230\nwe would asymmetrically encrypt\nthe symmetrically encrypted key.\n\n864\n00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:51.660\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n865\n00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:56.290\nwe could securely transmit potentially\nusing hybrid cryptography, we could\n\n866\n00:42:56.290 --> 00:43:01.420\nsymmetrically encrypt data, we could then\nasymmetrically encrypt the symmetric key.\n\n867\n00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:07.050\nTransmit the asymmetrically encrypted key\nand then allow somebody to open the data\n\n868\n00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:12.040\nup securely, overcoming the limitations\nof symmetric encryption, by applying\n\n869\n00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:16.250\nasymmetric cryptography to the problem\nof key management and key transfer.\n\n870\n00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:19.450\nAnd this is what we would commonly\nrefer to hybrid cryptography.\n\n871\n00:43:19.450 --> 00:43:21.680\nAnd this overcomes\na significant challenge.\n\n872\n00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:24.530\nAnd this is one of the ways that we\nactually do this because we gain\n\n873\n00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:27.300\nthe advantage of symmetric\nencryption speed.\n\n874\n00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:30.260\nWe gain the advantage of the protection\nwith the private key but\n\n875\n00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:33.700\nwe also overcome the limitation of\nkey management and key transmission.\n\n876\n00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:35.820\nSo that's gonna actually help us as well.\n\n877\n00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:39.524\nSo just some interesting stuff as\nwe're starting out our conversations\n\n878\n00:43:39.524 --> 00:43:43.107\naround the ideas here in the asymmetric\ncryptography solution that we\n\n879\n00:43:43.107 --> 00:43:44.516\nwanna go through with you.\n\n880\n00:43:44.516 --> 00:43:49.418\nAnd obviously a lot more to come in some\nup coming episodes about all the history,\n\n881\n00:43:49.418 --> 00:43:50.787\nall the fun facts, and\n\n882\n00:43:50.787 --> 00:43:55.281\nthe cool moving parts of solution\nthat go into asymmetric cryptography.\n\n883\n00:43:55.281 --> 00:43:57.986\nAnd we wanna make sure we have a sense\nof this and laid it out for you and\n\n884\n00:43:57.986 --> 00:43:59.377\ngave you a good visual reference.\n\n885\n00:43:59.377 --> 00:44:01.672\nSo not only can you study and\nbe successful,\n\n886\n00:44:01.672 --> 00:44:05.640\nyou gonna take the ECS exam but also you\ncan refer back to this and use it as a way\n\n887\n00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:10.070\nto really make sure you understand all\nthe concepts we've been talking about.\n\n888\n00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:10.780\n&gt;&gt; Very cool stuff.\n\n889\n00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:12.040\nIt's an interesting compare and\n\n890\n00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:15.880\ncontrast when it comes to looking\nat symmetric versus asymmetric.\n\n891\n00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:18.350\nHow they work differently,\nand why, obviously,\n\n892\n00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:21.108\nas Adam has said asymmetric\nhas been the gold standard for\n\n893\n00:44:21.108 --> 00:44:24.047\nencrypting data that wants to\ngo across the wire somewhere.\n\n894\n00:44:24.047 --> 00:44:28.930\nSo someone can encrypt and decrypt with,\nat least, some kind of safety.\n\n895\n00:44:28.930 --> 00:44:29.940\nVery interesting

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:10.515 --> 00:00:12.181\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:14.033\n&gt;&gt; All right Greetings everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:14.033 --> 00:00:16.988\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.988 --> 00:00:20.340\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode we are back with more of\n\n7\n00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.310\nour ECES series, and yeah it's not\na cool conference out in Vegas.\n\n8\n00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.630\nThat they do about neat stuff.\n\n9\n00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.980\nIt's a talking cryptography today and\n\n10\n00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.230\ndoing a part two on\nasymmetric cryptography.\n\n11\n00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.838\nJoining us back in the studio to continue\nthat conversation our good friend\n\n12\n00:00:33.838 --> 00:00:34.850\nMr. Adam Gordon.\n\n13\n00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.610\nAdam, welcome back, sir.\n\n14\n00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.420\n&gt;&gt; How do, how do.\n\n15\n00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.135\nSo, we're gonna continue talking,\nas Danel was suggesting.\n\n16\n00:00:40.135 --> 00:00:43.859\nA pick up where we left off, but fill\nin with some interesting hopefully, and\n\n17\n00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:46.629\nsome cool information about\nasymmetric cryptography.\n\n18\n00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.905\nIn our last episode, did a fairly\ndeep dive with some pictures and\n\n19\n00:00:50.905 --> 00:00:57.080\nexplanations around symmetric, asymmetric,\nand also talking about digital signatures.\n\n20\n00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.910\nWe reviewed back through how all that\nworks, making sure that we understand\n\n21\n00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.940\nwhat's going on there and just giving you\na general thought process around that to\n\n22\n00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.450\nreally set us up to be successful\nin this part of the conversation.\n\n23\n00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.200\nInvite you to go back and take a look\nat that, if you haven't seen it yet.\n\n24\n00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.980\nWe want to start off by talk\na bit about some topics that\n\n25\n00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.388\nalso come back to us from prior episodes.\n\n26\n00:01:17.388 --> 00:01:22.030\nWe went through extensive discussions\naround the vocabulary of cryptography, and\n\n27\n00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.990\nspent three episodes going\nthrough all the terms with you.\n\n28\n00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.797\nWe defined asymmetric, defined symmetric,\nsychronous, asychronous, block and\n\n29\n00:01:29.797 --> 00:01:32.510\ncipher or block and\ncipher I always do that.\n\n30\n00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.080\nBlock and stream cipher.\n\n31\n00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.200\nWe talked about diffusion,\nconfusion, the avalanche effect.\n\n32\n00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.160\nWant to make sure that we remember these\nterms, but especially the concepts\n\n33\n00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.050\nof diffusion, confusion and the avalanche\neffect with regards to asymmetric\n\n34\n00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.620\ncryptography, because they are important\nas forming the foundation for us.\n\n35\n00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.598\nWith regards to diffusion, we talked about\nthe fact that if we make changes to one\n\n36\n00:01:54.598 --> 00:01:58.703\ncharacter in the plain text it will affect\nmultiple characters in the ciphertext.\n\n37\n00:01:58.703 --> 00:02:03.615\nSo we are diffusing or spreading out\nthose changes and making them propagate\n\n38\n00:02:03.615 --> 00:02:08.142\nto create more, what we would ultimately\nsay is the ability to hide and\n\n39\n00:02:08.142 --> 00:02:11.300\ncreate obfuscation around our intent.\n\n40\n00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.410\nMake it harder to reverse engineer\nthe solutions, as we talked about.\n\n41\n00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.510\nConfusion, making that relationship\nbetween the statistical frequencies\n\n42\n00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.840\nof the ciphertext, as we talk about, and\nthe actual key as complex as possible.\n\n43\n00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.523\nThe idea here is that, when we\nare looking to hide what we're doing,\n\n44\n00:02:26.523 --> 00:02:30.669\nlooking to make it non-obvious,\nlooking to prevent reverse engineering.\n\n45\n00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:32.835\nThat the more confused we are generically,\n\n46\n00:02:32.835 --> 00:02:37.100\nif you think about this in the real world\nprobably makes a lot of sense, as well.\n\n47\n00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.040\nThe more confused we\nare about how things work.\n\n48\n00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.690\nThe more confused we are,\nthe more obfuscated,\n\n49\n00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.770\nthe more hidden that data information is,\nthe less likely it is that the bad actor\n\n50\n00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.610\ncan use that against us and figure out\nwhat to do to crack the encryption.\n\n51\n00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.790\nSo we use complex substitution\nalgorithms to create confusion.\n\n52\n00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.020\nWe do x or\nmultiple rounds as we talked about,\n\n53\n00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.710\nmultiple round function applied\nwith an exclusive or in x or.\n\n54\n00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.693\nTo be able to compare, derive the result\nand take the result and feed it back in.\n\n55\n00:03:06.693 --> 00:03:11.459\nAnd then ultimately, as we go through\nfigure out how to do all of that\n\n56\n00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.010\nmultiple times continuing\nto go back over it.\n\n57\n00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.971\nAnd as a result of\niterating through that so\n\n58\n00:03:17.971 --> 00:03:21.672\nmany different times,\nwe are then able to over time,\n\n59\n00:03:21.672 --> 00:03:26.630\nhopefully obscure and create confusion\naround what our end result is.\n\n60\n00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.529\nAnd how it relates back,\nthe end result being the ciphertext,\n\n61\n00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:31.618\nhow it relates back to\nwhere we started from.\n\n62\n00:03:31.618 --> 00:03:35.430\nOur starting point our input, referred\nto commonly as our plain text, right?\n\n63\n00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.200\nAnd so, that's all we're looking to do.\n\n64\n00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.979\nThe avalanche effect,\nwe talked about this as well,\n\n65\n00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:43.885\nsmall changes yielding major changes\ndown the road in terms of the output.\n\n66\n00:03:43.885 --> 00:03:47.733\nSo if we make smaller changes somewhere\nin the middle, in the beginning,\n\n67\n00:03:47.733 --> 00:03:51.518\nand we propagate those changes over time,\nwe want to have an amplified or\n\n68\n00:03:51.518 --> 00:03:53.210\nan amplification effect.\n\n69\n00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.920\nThink of an avalanche coming downhill,\nthat's where the concept comes from.\n\n70\n00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.570\nThink about the fact that, avalanches\nyou see them in movies all the time,\n\n71\n00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.850\ntend to start out as something small, and\n\n72\n00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.780\nthen they move quickly downhill gathering\nforce, gathering material as they go.\n\n73\n00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.240\nAnd as a result, if you happen to be\nunfortunate enough to be at the bottom of\n\n74\n00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.550\nthat, right, you're gonna get overwhelmed\nmost likely with a huge, massive\n\n75\n00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.830\namount of stuff that's come down the side\nof the mountain or wherever it is.\n\n76\n00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.510\nAnd so wanna think about this right.\n\n77\n00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.040\nSmall changes yielding large\neffects in the output.\n\n78\n00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.308\nSo if we are gonna be able\nto think about the logic and\n\n79\n00:04:26.308 --> 00:04:30.118\nthe impact of changing small\nnumbers of bits along the way.\n\n80\n00:04:30.118 --> 00:04:34.678\nWe want to amplify that and change in\nthe output large amounts of stuff to\n\n81\n00:04:34.678 --> 00:04:38.990\nfurther obfuscate,\nfurther ultimately confuse and diffuse.\n\n82\n00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.380\nThe information necessary, again,\nto think about reverse engineering.\n\n83\n00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.930\nRemember, we talked about the fact that\nthe Avalanche Effect was Horst Feistel's\n\n84\n00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.710\nconcept, the variation he creates on\nClaude Shannon's concept of Diffusion,\n\n85\n00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.360\nwhich is where Diffusion is\noriginally defined and comes from.\n\n86\n00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.295\nShannon's paper and Shannon's book\nthat lays out Information theory and\n\n87\n00:04:58.295 --> 00:05:02.615\nthe thought processes around it, are where\nthe concepts of Diffusion come from.\n\n88\n00:05:02.615 --> 00:05:07.057\nBut Feistel builds on that, modifies\na little bit, changes it, updates it and\n\n89\n00:05:07.057 --> 00:05:11.900\ncreates the concept of the avalanche\neffect and that's what we're seeing here.\n\n90\n00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:17.080\nChanges in one or more bits, ultimately is\ngonna affect perhaps if not all the bits,\n\n91\n00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.970\nand the majority of the bits,\nin the ciphertext.\n\n92\n00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.970\nIf we get a complete\nchain in the ciphertext,\n\n93\n00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.920\nwe call this a complete avalanche.\n\n94\n00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.500\nWe get a partial chain,\nit's just referred to as an avalanche.\n\n95\n00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.770\nSo, just wanna make sure we're\nfamiliar with these general concepts.\n\n96\n00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.990\nWe also wanna talk about entropy, but\nperhaps not the entropy that you think of,\n\n97\n00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.290\nor that I would think of, and\nI'm sure Daniel would think of,\n\n98\n00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.780\nmany of you would think of, with regards\nto the laws of thermodynamics, right?\n\n99\n00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:39.830\nNot that entropy.\n\n100\n00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.270\nBut we do talk about, and\nShannon talks about and\n\n101\n00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.800\ndefines in information theory,\nthe idea of entropy as well.\n\n102\n00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.500\nBut the entropy here is the measure\nof uncertainty associated with\n\n103\n00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.327\na random variable.\n\n104\n00:05:50.327 --> 00:05:55.254\nAnd so this idea of understanding\nhow entropy plays into cryptography,\n\n105\n00:05:55.254 --> 00:06:00.182\nis really understanding how to measure\nthe uncertainty associated with\n\n106\n00:06:00.182 --> 00:06:01.570\na random variable.\n\n107\n00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.577\nThis leads us to use random number\ngeneration, ultimately pseudo or\n\n108\n00:06:05.577 --> 00:06:08.547\nfull number generation used\nto then derive keys and\n\n109\n00:06:08.547 --> 00:06:11.463\nvalues to create keys is\nwhat we're looking for.\n\n110\n00:06:11.463 --> 00:06:15.195\nBecause if we can create enough\nrandomness, enough uncertainty,\n\n111\n00:06:15.195 --> 00:06:19.581\naround the generation, it's highly\nunlikely that somebody can find a pattern\n\n112\n00:06:19.581 --> 00:06:23.769\nthat may lead them to understand what\nthe key is, and how it was derived, and\n\n113\n00:06:23.769 --> 00:06:28.250\ntherefore guess the key and be able\nto Brute Force Ultimately the system.\n\n114\n00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.830\nSo we look at a measure of\nentropy Shannon's entropy,\n\n115\n00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.400\nas being able to understand how random,\nand\n\n116\n00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.630\ntherefore how unlikely it is that\nsomebody may be able to guess that.\n\n117\n00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.340\nKind of interesting when you think\nabout you have the thought process of\n\n118\n00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.200\nthe traditional definition of entropy\nin thermodynamics, and taking that,\n\n119\n00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.470\nkinda turning it a little bit, right?\n\n120\n00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.410\nModifying it if you will,\nturning it on its head a little bit.\n\n121\n00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.230\nAnd Shannon applying that concep,t but\ndefining it differently\n\n122\n00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.150\nwithin the boundary of the confines\nof information theory.\n\n123\n00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.430\nAnd then that coming back in,\n\n124\n00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:00.810\nand being applied over to our\ndiscussions here around cryptography.\n\n125\n00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:04.020\nIt's just fascinating when you look back\non some of the history of where this stuff\n\n126\n00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.451\ncomes from, as we've been\ntalking about in prior episodes.\n\n127\n00:07:06.451 --> 00:07:08.883\nAnd Looking at not only\nthe seminal figures,\n\n128\n00:07:08.883 --> 00:07:13.044\nthe people that really we stand on\nthe shoulders of as I've said before, with\n\n129\n00:07:13.044 --> 00:07:17.461\nregards to their ability to contribute,\nand really create these things that we in\n\n130\n00:07:17.461 --> 00:07:21.930\nmany cases use all the time and don't\nalways understand where they come from.\n\n131\n00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:23.770\nBut also, you just the thought process.\n\n132\n00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:27.570\nThe mindset of somebody that can sit down,\nlook at this and\n\n133\n00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:31.630\nthen come up with an innovative and\nnew way to explain it that incorporates.\n\n134\n00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:36.046\nIn some cases something like entropy as a\nthought process, which has been around for\n\n135\n00:07:36.046 --> 00:07:38.845\nhundreds of years,\nidentified very early on right,\n\n136\n00:07:38.845 --> 00:07:43.098\nas we see the greats of mathematics and\nscience like Newton and people like that.\n\n137\n00:07:43.098 --> 00:07:45.937\nComing up with all the laws\nthat essentially govern or\n\n138\n00:07:45.937 --> 00:07:50.165\nidentifying the themes, and calling them\nthe laws that govern modern world and\n\n139\n00:07:50.165 --> 00:07:52.750\nall the things we do and take for granted.\n\n140\n00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.710\nBut the reality is, taking those and\nadjusting them in some way.\n\n141\n00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:57.993\nIt's just kind of, at least I find it to\nbe, really interesting and fascinating.\n\n142\n00:07:57.993 --> 00:08:00.094\nBut you know, I'm one of those people,\nwhat can I tell you.\n\n143\n00:08:00.094 --> 00:08:00.778\n&gt;&gt; Agree to agree, Adam.\n\n144\n00:08:00.778 --> 00:08:02.307\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Agree to agree,\n\n145\n00:08:02.307 --> 00:08:02.841\n&gt;&gt; Fair enough,\n\n146\n00:08:02.841 --> 00:08:04.800\nand then we have Shannon's\nsource coding theorem.\n\n147\n00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.808\nOr source coding theorem as\nit's properly referred to.\n\n148\n00:08:07.808 --> 00:08:10.323\nThe idea that, and\nagain, he looks at this,\n\n149\n00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:12.990\nthis is Claude Shannon when I say Shannon.\n\n150\n00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:15.244\nHe's looking at all of this\nin information theory.\n\n151\n00:08:15.244 --> 00:08:19.033\nRemember, Shannon is one of the people\nthat sets up and ultimately does\n\n152\n00:08:19.033 --> 00:08:23.139\nthe background work that leads to the\nfounding of this school of thought known\n\n153\n00:08:23.139 --> 00:08:27.561\nas information theory that we use to this\nday to understand not only mathematics and\n\n154\n00:08:27.561 --> 00:08:31.410\nunderstand computers and\nunderstand how we process information.\n\n155\n00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:35.210\nBut really how a lot of what we think\nabout with cryptography is done and\n\n156\n00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:39.210\nhow we understand and see and\nthink about a lot of this today.\n\n157\n00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:40.050\nJust moving up so\n\n158\n00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:43.270\nI can see all my notes as we're talking,\nkeep track of where we are.\n\n159\n00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.720\nSo the idea of Shannon's\nsource coding theorem\n\n160\n00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.030\nalso comes to us out\nof information theory.\n\n161\n00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:52.456\nThe idea that it is impossible to compress\nthe data that we're thinking about.\n\n162\n00:08:52.456 --> 00:08:55.620\nSo using the plain text,\nlet's say, and working it through,\n\n163\n00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:59.324\nmoving through series of XORs and\niterations, and round functions, and\n\n164\n00:08:59.324 --> 00:09:00.840\nall the things we talk about.\n\n165\n00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.810\nIt's impossible to compress that\ndata such that the code rate\n\n166\n00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.290\nis less than the Shannon\nentropy of the source.\n\n167\n00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:09.030\nWe talked about entropy and\nShannon entropy a minute ago,\n\n168\n00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.910\nwithout it being virtually certain\nthat information will be lost.\n\n169\n00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:16.178\nIn other words, what the source coding\ntheorem stipulates is that we get to\n\n170\n00:09:16.178 --> 00:09:19.566\na certain point in the cryptographic\noperations that we run\n\n171\n00:09:19.566 --> 00:09:22.615\nthe risk of losing or\ncorrupting the original data and\n\n172\n00:09:22.615 --> 00:09:26.982\nthe meaning of it if we engage in certain\noperations beyond a certain point.\n\n173\n00:09:26.982 --> 00:09:31.360\nBecause we lose the ability\nto keep the data intact.\n\n174\n00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.230\nIn other words, the integrity of\nthe data is potentially compromised.\n\n175\n00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.767\nSo it's interesting as a thought process\nthat we have to take account of and\n\n176\n00:09:37.767 --> 00:09:40.026\nunderstand that this is\npotentially an issue.\n\n177\n00:09:40.026 --> 00:09:42.896\nAnd if you think about this in\nthe real world from a slightly\n\n178\n00:09:42.896 --> 00:09:46.529\ndifferent perspective, you probably,\nand just help me out with this for\n\n179\n00:09:46.529 --> 00:09:48.490\na minute if you don't mind, sir.\n\n180\n00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:52.010\nBut you've probably, I'm sure,\nwe've all encrypted data before, right?\n\n181\n00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:54.000\nThat's easy, not a big deal,\nwe do this all the time.\n\n182\n00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.910\nBut we've also probably zipped\nup a file or two in our time.\n\n183\n00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.320\nPerhaps with WinZip,\nperhaps with 7-Zip, perhaps with TAR,\n\n184\n00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.080\nwe tried unTARing something\nbefore we came on.\n\n185\n00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.990\nWhatever the case may be, we've all\nused compression programs of one kind or\n\n186\n00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:08.390\nanother is my point, right?\n\n187\n00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:12.330\nAnd you know that you can modify the\ncompression on data, can make it less or\n\n188\n00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:16.070\nmore in terms of the amount of\ncompression to get extra space or\n\n189\n00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:19.190\nessentially shrink down and\nget rid of the white space and\n\n190\n00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:22.440\nthe excess bits through de-duplication and\nthings of that nature.\n\n191\n00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.930\nThat allows us to get to a kernel,\n\n192\n00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:29.500\nor a core of data that Is smaller,\nand therefore more manageable.\n\n193\n00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.560\nBut we also hopefully know and\nunderstand that when we do that\n\n194\n00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:36.600\nwe get to a point where we can't\ncompress the data anymore.\n\n195\n00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:40.050\nBecause if we do,\nwe run the risk of essentially losing\n\n196\n00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:42.850\nthe understanding of the integrity and\nthe validity of that data.\n\n197\n00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:45.740\nNow in modern programs we\nhave built in controls that\n\n198\n00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.000\nwill prevent us from doing that.\n\n199\n00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.399\nIn other words, the compression algorithm\nused in the compression program says yeah,\n\n200\n00:10:51.399 --> 00:10:54.619\nI can only go this far,\n200% compression or whatever it is.\n\n201\n00:10:54.619 --> 00:10:57.280\nAfter that,\nyou don't have an option to go anymore.\n\n202\n00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.520\nIt's not like they have like a spinal tap.\n\n203\n00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.267\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I love that scene.\n\n204\n00:11:02.267 --> 00:11:02.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n205\n00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.051\n&gt;&gt; When the apps go past ten,\nand they're like, well,\n\n206\n00:11:06.051 --> 00:11:08.015\nwhy's it go up higher than ten?\n\n207\n00:11:08.015 --> 00:11:09.881\nBecause it's louder than net, right.\n\n208\n00:11:09.881 --> 00:11:14.698\nBecause we don't have that ability\nin the compression algorithms.\n\n209\n00:11:14.698 --> 00:11:17.770\nBecause the reality is we\nknow based on this idea of\n\n210\n00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:21.570\nShannon's source coding theorem\nthat if we go past that,\n\n211\n00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:24.620\nthat we're gonna run the risk\nof essentially ruining the data.\n\n212\n00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:29.240\nAnd so we see this applied, and\nwe see this idea applied in many places.\n\n213\n00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.790\nAgain, we kinda take it for granted.\n\n214\n00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:36.870\nWe don't really think about the fact that\nwhen we are essentially compressing data\n\n215\n00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:41.210\nthat we're worrying about a function that\nis actually related to encrypting data.\n\n216\n00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:44.130\nBut although the two are not\ndirectly related, let me be clear.\n\n217\n00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:46.840\nI'm not suggesting they are,\nbut I'm just pointing out\n\n218\n00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:51.300\nthat the impact of one activity\nhas ripple effects in other areas.\n\n219\n00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:55.880\nAnd that these two are interrelated behind\nthe scenes because of the theory behind\n\n220\n00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.920\nhow both these thought processes work and\n\n221\n00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.640\nthe reason why we can't do\ncertain things a certain way.\n\n222\n00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.280\nSo I always find that kind of stuff\ninteresting myself, as I said.\n\n223\n00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.009\nBut as Daniel said, we'll agree to agree-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n224\n00:12:06.009 --> 00:12:07.585\n&gt;&gt; Because I am just one of those people.\n\n225\n00:12:07.585 --> 00:12:10.630\nBut that's where we get Shannon's\nsource coding theorem from.\n\n226\n00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:14.910\nAll of this comes from information theory\nand the thought processes that he and\n\n227\n00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:17.750\nothers, Warren Lever, the gentleman\nhe wrote the original book with\n\n228\n00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:21.910\nabout mathematical theory and\nhow that leads to information theory.\n\n229\n00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:24.190\nHow they kind of saw the world and\nwhat they did.\n\n230\n00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:26.250\nWe talked about this in a prior episode.\n\n231\n00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:29.040\nWe also wanna talk a bit\nabout number groupings.\n\n232\n00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:33.820\nAnd this is kind of review back\nto preschool, primary school,\n\n233\n00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.940\ngrade school, high school, whatever you\nmay wanna think of it as when you did\n\n234\n00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:40.120\nvarious stages of math and\nlearned about the basics of math.\n\n235\n00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.228\nAnd we were talking about\nthis before we came on.\n\n236\n00:12:42.228 --> 00:12:44.600\nDaniel and I both agree,\nneither one of us individually or\n\n237\n00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.210\ntogether has enough smarts\nto be the math guy.\n\n238\n00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:49.870\nSo we're not gonna claim that title\nbecause we're both really not\n\n239\n00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.380\nwired that way, right?\n\n240\n00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:55.065\nBut the reality is that there are some\nbasic rules about mathematics.\n\n241\n00:12:55.065 --> 00:12:59.015\nYou can do addition, subtraction,\nmultiplication, division,\n\n242\n00:12:59.015 --> 00:13:02.910\nbefore identified activities,\nor operations, as we call them.\n\n243\n00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:04.640\nThere's the law of parentheses, right,\n\n244\n00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.500\nyou do everything in the parentheses\nfirst, then you work yourself out.\n\n245\n00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.010\nThere are basic rules that most\nof us probably are familiar with,\n\n246\n00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:12.360\neven if we're not real\ncomfortable with math.\n\n247\n00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.110\nThat's the extent of my basic\nrule knowledge by the way, right?\n\n248\n00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:18.150\nSo we get those things and\nwe're not going to teach you those again.\n\n249\n00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:19.990\nThis is not about rudimentary math, but\n\n250\n00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:22.933\nrather there are some rudimentary\nrules around number grouping.\n\n251\n00:13:22.933 --> 00:13:25.560\nSo we also learn when we\ngo through basic math.\n\n252\n00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.388\nWe just want to remind you of them because\nthen they roll forward and help us\n\n253\n00:13:29.388 --> 00:13:34.550\nunderstand things like prime numbers,\nco-primes, quotient, modulus operator.\n\n254\n00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:35.370\nDaniel claimed that one.\n\n255\n00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:36.040\nHe understands that one.\n\n256\n00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.230\nHe's gonna explain that one.\n\n257\n00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:40.190\nThe Fibonacci numbers,\nthe Fibonacci sequence.\n\n258\n00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:43.520\nThere are some things that are built\non the basic understandings of number\n\n259\n00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:47.760\ngroupings that we have to talk about to\nbetter understand asymmetric cryptography.\n\n260\n00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.570\nAnd so we wanna just quickly run you back\nthrough what those number groupings are,\n\n261\n00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:55.000\nreminding you that all of\nthis is in the show notes.\n\n262\n00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000\nSo I encourage you to download those,\nin case you need a little bit more\n\n263\n00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.010\ndefinition documentation, and ability\nto study and work with that knowledge.\n\n264\n00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:04.702\nNot just listening to us,\nin other words, but seeing it in print.\n\n265\n00:14:04.702 --> 00:14:07.050\nPut all the information we're\nsharing with you in the notes.\n\n266\n00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:08.200\nEncourage you to go take a look\n\n267\n00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.370\nas we always do download those and\nwork with them.\n\n268\n00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:13.290\nSo when we represent number groupings,\nwe're talking about different ways to\n\n269\n00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:16.510\nunderstand numbers and\nthe kinds of numbers that exist.\n\n270\n00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:20.880\nA big capital N is traditionally used for\nwhat are called natural numbers.\n\n271\n00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.910\nNatural numbers are anything from 1\nthrough almost infinity in theory, but\n\n272\n00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:30.250\nnot 0, not negatives,\nnot fractions, just whole integers,\n\n273\n00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:32.060\nas we would say, that are positive.\n\n274\n00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:35.650\nSo natural numbers, right, and\nI put there like 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.\n\n275\n00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:38.610\nJust because those are traditionally\nwhat we call natural numbers, right?\n\n276\n00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:43.119\nZ, capital Z, and it is important to know\nuppercase versus lowercase cuz most of\n\n277\n00:14:43.119 --> 00:14:45.043\nthese are gonna be uppercase, but\n\n278\n00:14:45.043 --> 00:14:48.910\nthe imaginary numbers is a lowercase\ni when we represent it that way.\n\n279\n00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:50.854\nSo we are case sensitive, right.\n\n280\n00:14:50.854 --> 00:14:55.353\nWe're a kinder, gentler number grouping\nfoundational thought process here.\n\n281\n00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:56.899\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we do wanna make sure we take\n\n282\n00:14:56.899 --> 00:15:00.558\nnote of the fact that when I say it's\ncapital N, it's important to know that\n\n283\n00:15:00.558 --> 00:15:04.578\nbecause in mathematical notation, there is\na standard that we use for all of this.\n\n284\n00:15:04.578 --> 00:15:08.200\nAnd if you write it as lowercase n,\nit means something totally different.\n\n285\n00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.020\nIt's not a natural number\ndesignation in the system, but\n\n286\n00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:13.590\nrather it means a variable most likely and\nsomething totally different.\n\n287\n00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:16.065\nSo you do wanna know\nthese are case sensitive.\n\n288\n00:15:16.065 --> 00:15:17.585\nSo natural numbers, capital N,\n\n289\n00:15:17.585 --> 00:15:21.405\ncapital Z, integers as opposed to capital\nI which would have made a lot more sense.\n\n290\n00:15:21.405 --> 00:15:24.315\nBut I guess you and I weren't around\nwhen they did this and nobody asked me.\n\n291\n00:15:24.315 --> 00:15:25.573\n&gt;&gt; They didn't ask me either.\n\n292\n00:15:25.573 --> 00:15:27.645\n&gt;&gt; I would've gone with capital I\npersonally, but that's just me.\n\n293\n00:15:27.645 --> 00:15:33.300\nSo capital Z for integers cuz, as I said,\nthat makes so much sense, but anyway.\n\n294\n00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:35.410\nIntegers, right, what makes up that group?\n\n295\n00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:39.130\nWe have natural numbers, we just defined\nthose, all positive whole numbers, right,\n\n296\n00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:42.140\nfrom one forward, no zero,\nno negatives, no fractions.\n\n297\n00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:45.801\nSo integers are natural numbers plus zero,\nplus negative numbers.\n\n298\n00:15:45.801 --> 00:15:50.050\nSo in other words, any number that can be\nwritten without a fractional component is\n\n299\n00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:51.755\nwhat an integer would be.\n\n300\n00:15:51.755 --> 00:15:53.188\nSo when we think about integers,\n\n301\n00:15:53.188 --> 00:15:56.273\nwe think about everything other\nthan essentially fractions, right?\n\n302\n00:15:56.273 --> 00:15:59.233\nSo three-fourths would not be an integer,\n\n303\n00:15:59.233 --> 00:16:02.677\nbut an actual number of one,\nzero, negative one.\n\n304\n00:16:02.677 --> 00:16:05.364\nAny or all of those would be an integer.\n\n305\n00:16:05.364 --> 00:16:07.018\nJust so we understand.\n\n306\n00:16:07.018 --> 00:16:08.666\nQ, capital Q.\n\n307\n00:16:08.666 --> 00:16:09.886\nRemember Q on Star Trek?\n\n308\n00:16:09.886 --> 00:16:11.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, are you kidding me?\n&gt;&gt; Deep Space, right?\n\n309\n00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:13.574\n&gt;&gt; No, that was Next Generation.\n&gt;&gt; No, it's Next Generation.\n\n310\n00:16:13.574 --> 00:16:15.140\n&gt;&gt; He was on Deep Space Nine\na couple times.\n\n311\n00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.120\n&gt;&gt; He showed up a couple times\non the cross-over episodes.\n\n312\n00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.900\nRight, but, yeah, on a, yeah.\n\n313\n00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:19.900\nAnyways, so on that one.\n\n314\n00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.070\nSo yeah, the Q character was kinda cool.\n\n315\n00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:25.060\nIt was like the funny hat he wore, like\nin the first couple, Farpoint Encounter.\n\n316\n00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:26.843\nFarpoint where he has the judge.\n\n317\n00:16:26.843 --> 00:16:28.624\n&gt;&gt; He's the judge, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; The crazy judge outfit and\n\n318\n00:16:28.624 --> 00:16:30.790\nhe's got the crazy hat and robes on.\n\n319\n00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:34.570\nI always thought that would be like\na cool Halloween costume or something.\n\n320\n00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:37.300\n&gt;&gt; And you know what?\nYou'd probably be very unique in your\n\n321\n00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:37.935\ncostume.\n\n322\n00:16:37.935 --> 00:16:40.657\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, nobody would get it, right?\n\n323\n00:16:40.657 --> 00:16:43.511\nBy the way, this is our random aside,\nin case you were wondering.\n\n324\n00:16:43.511 --> 00:16:47.432\nCuz it's also like if you're\na Big Bang Theory person, when they show,\n\n325\n00:16:47.432 --> 00:16:49.570\nthis is one of the early episodes.\n\n326\n00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:54.140\nBut when they do the Halloween party,\nPenny throws a Halloween party and\n\n327\n00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:58.140\nall the guys go as various characters.\n\n328\n00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:01.572\nAnd Sheldon shows up as,\n\n329\n00:17:01.572 --> 00:17:07.180\nhe's wearing this crazy black and\nwhite costume.\n\n330\n00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:10.016\nAnd, he's the,\nwhat the hell is the effect?\n\n331\n00:17:10.016 --> 00:17:13.302\nHe's the, you know when you hear a sound\ncoming and then it gets louder and\n\n332\n00:17:13.302 --> 00:17:14.845\nthen it goes away really quickly?\n\n333\n00:17:14.845 --> 00:17:16.093\n&gt;&gt; The doppler effect?\n&gt;&gt; The doppler effect, right,\n\n334\n00:17:16.093 --> 00:17:16.684\nthe doppler shift.\n\n335\n00:17:16.684 --> 00:17:18.930\nHe goes as the doppler effect or\nthe doppler shift.\n\n336\n00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:20.816\nSo he's got the black and white thing on.\n\n337\n00:17:20.816 --> 00:17:22.180\nAnd he has to explain it to everybody.\n\n338\n00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:23.830\nNobody gets what it is.\n\n339\n00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:27.226\nRight, because, everybody there is\ndressed up as cavemen, Batgirl and\n\n340\n00:17:27.226 --> 00:17:28.470\nall the normal stuff.\n\n341\n00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:29.845\nSo it's kinda, yeah,\nit would be like one of those.\n\n342\n00:17:29.845 --> 00:17:32.800\nYou'd be sitting around and in your\nmind you're the coolest person, but\n\n343\n00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.790\neverybody around you is like,\nwhat an idiot.\n\n344\n00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:35.616\nWhat the hell is that, right?\n\n345\n00:17:35.616 --> 00:17:37.280\nDon't have a clue what that is.\n\n346\n00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.300\nSo that would probably wind up being me.\n\n347\n00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:41.560\nBut I think that will be a cool costume.\n\n348\n00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.001\nIf I go as Q, it will be kind of cool.\n\n349\n00:17:43.001 --> 00:17:44.902\nI mean, you could do the obvious,\njust put a big Q on, but\n\n350\n00:17:44.902 --> 00:17:46.421\nthen everybody thinks you're the letter Q.\n\n351\n00:17:46.421 --> 00:17:48.659\nThey wouldn't think you're\nactually Q from there.\n\n352\n00:17:48.659 --> 00:17:53.641\n&gt;&gt; You could make a line waiting,\nsometimes they call that a queue.\n\n353\n00:17:53.641 --> 00:17:54.419\n&gt;&gt; They do, they do, right.\n\n354\n00:17:54.419 --> 00:17:58.213\nYou could have like five people attached\nwith string and it would be like-\n\n355\n00:17:58.213 --> 00:17:59.214\n&gt;&gt; A little velvet rope.\n\n356\n00:17:59.214 --> 00:18:01.059\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, something like that,\nthat would also work.\n\n357\n00:18:01.059 --> 00:18:04.142\nSo variations on a theme, variations on Q.\n\n358\n00:18:04.142 --> 00:18:07.640\nSo the big capital letter Q for\nrational numbers.\n\n359\n00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:09.300\n&gt;&gt; They'll never forget Q after this.\n\n360\n00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:10.950\n&gt;&gt; They will never forget it,\nthat's right.\n\n361\n00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:13.550\nThey won't remember the others,\nthey will never forget Q.\n\n362\n00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:16.610\nSo capital Q, right,\nremember capital and natural numbers.\n\n363\n00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:18.390\nCapital Z, integers.\n\n364\n00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:21.270\nCapital Q, rational numbers.\n\n365\n00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:24.850\nNumbers expressed as the ratios of\nintegers, what we would commonly call\n\n366\n00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:27.983\nfractions, are gonna fall into\nthe rational number category.\n\n367\n00:18:27.983 --> 00:18:30.600\nR, capital R for real numbers.\n\n368\n00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.620\nReal numbers include all rationals.\n\n369\n00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:34.090\nSo all the rational numbers.\n\n370\n00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:37.770\nThey include things like negative three,\na fraction,\n\n371\n00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:41.130\nwhatever it may be, and\nall the irrational numbers.\n\n372\n00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:45.850\nThings like the root or the square root of\ntwo, which would be something that's gonna\n\n373\n00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:48.980\nhave a remainder going after it for\nsome length of time, whatever that may be.\n\n374\n00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:53.510\nSo real numbers include all the rationals,\nas well as all the irrational numbers.\n\n375\n00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:58.150\nThat's a capital R and\nthen lowercase i, lowercase i,\n\n376\n00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:00.430\nsmall i, not big I, but small i.\n\n377\n00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:02.730\nImaginary numbers.\n\n378\n00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:05.836\nImaginary numbers, numbers whose square\nis going to be a negative are imaginary\n\n379\n00:19:05.836 --> 00:19:08.986\nnumbers, as opposed to numbers you dream\nup at night when nobody else is around and\n\n380\n00:19:08.986 --> 00:19:09.599\nnobody knows.\n\n381\n00:19:09.599 --> 00:19:10.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n382\n00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:14.440\nimaginary numbers are numbers whose\nsquare is gonna be a negative.\n\n383\n00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.400\nThat's how we group numbers together, or\n\n384\n00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.420\nat least the classical groupings\nthat we will find when we go out and\n\n385\n00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:24.750\nwe take a look or think about this and\nunderstand the basic background\n\n386\n00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:29.410\nwith regards to number theory, number\ngrouping and how we manage all that.\n\n387\n00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:32.600\nBuilding on those thought processes,\nwant to make sure we can define and\n\n388\n00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.620\nunderstand the concept of a prime number.\n\n389\n00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:37.290\nIf I asked you, sir, what is a prime\nnumber, what would you tell me?\n\n390\n00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:41.070\n&gt;&gt; It's something that's only\nmultiplied by one and itself, right?\n\n391\n00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:43.560\n&gt;&gt; So a number whose factors are one and\nitself, absolutely.\n\n392\n00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:46.230\nSo three would, for\ninstance, be an example.\n\n393\n00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:47.916\nMost people say, I don't know,\na few primes, right?\n\n394\n00:19:47.916 --> 00:19:50.250\nOne, three, five, something like that.\n\n395\n00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:51.174\nThose will be prime numbers, right?\n\n396\n00:19:51.174 --> 00:19:53.420\nSo three and five are examples of primes.\n\n397\n00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:57.705\nSo a prime number is any number whose\nfactor is gonna be one and itself, right?\n\n398\n00:19:57.705 --> 00:19:59.880\nCoprime numbers, how about coprime?\n\n399\n00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:00.740\n&gt;&gt; You lost me.\n\n400\n00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:04.161\nThat sounds like math and\nI'm starting to sweat now.\n\n401\n00:20:04.161 --> 00:20:04.709\n&gt;&gt; All right, all right.\n\n402\n00:20:04.709 --> 00:20:06.509\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let's give Daniel a moment to\n\n403\n00:20:06.509 --> 00:20:07.450\ncollect himself.\n\n404\n00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:08.960\nBe calm, be cool, be collected.\n\n405\n00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.110\nWhy don't you-\n&gt;&gt; I'll hold on to the golden key.\n\n406\n00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.640\n&gt;&gt; Have a key.\n\n407\n00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:12.516\n&gt;&gt; All right, thank you, thank you.\n&gt;&gt; Take a key.\n\n408\n00:20:12.516 --> 00:20:13.275\nTake two, they're small, right?\n\n409\n00:20:13.275 --> 00:20:14.069\n&gt;&gt; I feel better now, yes.\n\n410\n00:20:14.069 --> 00:20:16.274\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n411\n00:20:16.274 --> 00:20:17.840\nlet's talk about coprime numbers for\na minute.\n\n412\n00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:21.060\nSo if we think that and we know, right,\nthat primes are essentially, as we said,\n\n413\n00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:23.700\nnumbers that factor out,\nwith the factor being one and\n\n414\n00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:28.110\nitself, coprimes are numbers that have no\nfactors in common with another number.\n\n415\n00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:30.970\nSo three and\nseven are examples of coprimes, right?\n\n416\n00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:34.560\nBecause three and seven have\nnothing in common with each other.\n\n417\n00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.878\nIf you think about that,\nyou can't put three into seven,\n\n418\n00:20:36.878 --> 00:20:38.071\na whole without a remainder.\n\n419\n00:20:38.071 --> 00:20:41.694\nYou can't put seven into three without\nsome sort of negative or remainder or\n\n420\n00:20:41.694 --> 00:20:43.010\nsomething like that.\n\n421\n00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:44.590\nThey have nothing in common.\n\n422\n00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:48.220\nAnd as a result,\nthey are what we call coprime numbers.\n\n423\n00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.200\nSo numbers that have no factors\nin common with another number\n\n424\n00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.130\nare considered coprimes.\n\n425\n00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:55.060\nJust another way of thinking about this,\nright?\n\n426\n00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:59.320\nAnd those concepts, important again for\nthe thought processes around how we engage\n\n427\n00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:02.868\nin not only asymmetric cryptography,\nbut cryptography in general.\n\n428\n00:21:02.868 --> 00:21:07.478\nBut especially asymmetric cryptography,\nbecause one of the most common\n\n429\n00:21:07.478 --> 00:21:12.231\nasymmetric algorithms, RSA, is an\nalgorithm that allows us to be able to or\n\n430\n00:21:12.231 --> 00:21:16.987\nuses the basic concepts of prime numbers\nto be able to factor out large primes\n\n431\n00:21:16.987 --> 00:21:19.690\nto then generate the keys that we use.\n\n432\n00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:23.720\nSo it's actually at the heart of\nmany of the algorithms we use.\n\n433\n00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.880\nAnd these concepts, although they\nseem sometimes disconnected or\n\n434\n00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.540\nnot really sensical based on\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n435\n00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:31.940\nWell, this is all about cryptography,\nwhy are we talking about math stuff?\n\n436\n00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.976\nIf I wanted to learn math, I'd go back\nto school and do algebra, right, or\n\n437\n00:21:34.976 --> 00:21:36.010\nstuff like that.\n\n438\n00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:37.810\nOr I'd run away screaming and hysterical,\n\n439\n00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:41.120\nas both of us would probably\ndo if we had to do that again.\n\n440\n00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.410\nI often reflect back,\nthis is our second round on the side for\n\n441\n00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:45.050\nthe episode, by the way.\n\n442\n00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:48.580\nI think about the fact that I,\nlegitimately, and I freely admit this and\n\n443\n00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:51.820\ntalk about this with my kids, cuz I think\nit's important to let them know this.\n\n444\n00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:53.940\nI really struggled with math\nwhen I was in high school and\n\n445\n00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.530\nI went through it the first time.\n\n446\n00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:58.130\nI'm not wired that way,\nI was not good at it at all.\n\n447\n00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:02.340\nReally just did not understand it,\ncouldn't make it work for me.\n\n448\n00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:08.110\nAnd just I significantly just\ncould not get above that bar.\n\n449\n00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:10.620\nAnd it's funny because there\nwere things I wanted to do.\n\n450\n00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:12.440\nI think I shared in one\nof the prior episodes.\n\n451\n00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.950\nI actually wanted to be a doctor early on.\n\n452\n00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:16.530\nThat's what I wanted to do,\ninitially, be a trauma surgeon.\n\n453\n00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:18.320\nAnd you need math.\n\n454\n00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:21.281\nAnd I got to that point in college where-\n&gt;&gt; Your dream was shattered.\n\n455\n00:22:21.281 --> 00:22:23.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was going through,\nI could do the science part.\n\n456\n00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:27.120\nWhich is kinda funny cuz you need math for\nscience, but I did physics, did chemistry,\n\n457\n00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.800\ndid biology, did organic chem, bio-chem.\n\n458\n00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.420\nI mean, I got through all that stuff and\nI made it work.\n\n459\n00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:37.280\nBut just the actual math itself like\nbeyond college algebra when I had to go\n\n460\n00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:41.960\nin and contemplate, like I told you in\ngraduate school, I had to do statistics.\n\n461\n00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.930\nI mean, even to this day I cringe.\n\n462\n00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:47.999\nBut yet having kids and then having to as\na parent, and you're gonna start to see\n\n463\n00:22:47.999 --> 00:22:51.608\nthis as they get older, right,\ncuz yours are much smaller than mine.\n\n464\n00:22:51.608 --> 00:22:54.856\nBut as they get older, and\nyou start having to deal with hey, Daddy,\n\n465\n00:22:54.856 --> 00:22:57.045\nMommy, can you help me with homework?\n\n466\n00:22:57.045 --> 00:22:59.340\nAnd sure, let me help you with that.\n\n467\n00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:02.100\nAnd you start having to\nre-live the math thing.\n\n468\n00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.650\nBelieve it or not, as an adult,\nI don't know what happens.\n\n469\n00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:06.640\nSomething happens in your brain,\nI'm not sure what it is,\n\n470\n00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:09.390\nbut it became a lot easier for me.\n\n471\n00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:13.330\nAnd things that I never really thought\nI learned, things I didn't understand.\n\n472\n00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:14.665\nAnd had I really sat down and\n\n473\n00:23:14.665 --> 00:23:18.507\nthought about them, probably could not\nexplain them up until very recently.\n\n474\n00:23:18.507 --> 00:23:21.370\nAnd it's not like I went back and\ndid a bunch of math all of a sudden.\n\n475\n00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:25.740\nBut my older one, especially,\nis doing a lot of advanced AP classes,\n\n476\n00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:28.850\nthings like that, as she finishes up,\ngets ready to get into college.\n\n477\n00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:34.110\nAnd I had to go through some like wicked\nmath with her and with my younger one.\n\n478\n00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:37.140\nAnd their stuff that I can\nsit down look at now and,\n\n479\n00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:38.391\nit's like The Matrix, I mean-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n\n480\n00:23:38.391 --> 00:23:39.562\n&gt;&gt; It's like that moment where\n\n481\n00:23:39.562 --> 00:23:42.578\nall of a sudden you look at it and\ngo, yeah, I can actually, that is,\n\n482\n00:23:42.578 --> 00:23:44.760\nlike I see the girl in the red dress-\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n483\n00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.800\n&gt;&gt; It's crazy because nothing changed for\nme.\n\n484\n00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:52.975\nI didn't go back and study statistics or\nalgebra or calculus, heaven forbid, right?\n\n485\n00:23:52.975 --> 00:23:54.530\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Again, and trigonometry,\n\n486\n00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:55.120\nforget about it.\n\n487\n00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:58.099\nI don't know what a triangle versus\na polygon versus a square is to\n\n488\n00:23:58.099 --> 00:23:58.757\nsave my life.\n\n489\n00:23:58.757 --> 00:24:03.447\nBut I can actually make sense of this\nstuff now, where before I had like this,\n\n490\n00:24:03.447 --> 00:24:06.060\nlike zero, right, understanding of it.\n\n491\n00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:10.048\nAnd then sitting down with them I've\nactually come to understand that I Somehow\n\n492\n00:24:10.048 --> 00:24:12.975\nhave retained a lot and\nknow a lot more than I thought I did.\n\n493\n00:24:12.975 --> 00:24:15.439\nWhich-\n&gt;&gt; One math area that I was always decent\n\n494\n00:24:15.439 --> 00:24:16.560\nat was geometry.\n\n495\n00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:19.745\nApparently people struggle with geometry.\n\n496\n00:24:19.745 --> 00:24:21.984\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I have no spatial recognition,\n\n497\n00:24:21.984 --> 00:24:26.580\nno spatial envisioning capabilities\nto this day, I mean literally.\n\n498\n00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:28.278\nI think I've told you one\nof these stories before.\n\n499\n00:24:28.278 --> 00:24:30.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I struggled putting together a piece of\n\n500\n00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:31.430\nIKEA furniture.\n\n501\n00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:34.690\nI'm the guy who looks at the diagram,\nturns it upside down and goes,\n\n502\n00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:37.980\nthat's just I don't know,\nsquare, rectangle, what is this?\n\n503\n00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:39.960\nIt looks like a drawer but I'm not sure.\n\n504\n00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.340\nI always put that stuff\ntogether backwards.\n\n505\n00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:42.890\nI wind up having to take it apart.\n\n506\n00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:44.100\nPutting it back together\nagain it's like the-\n\n507\n00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:44.990\n&gt;&gt; Instead of just turning it around.\n\n508\n00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:45.930\n&gt;&gt; First time's a dry run.\n\n509\n00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:51.090\nYeah just, I just,\nI have zero spatial capabilities.\n\n510\n00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:53.842\nJust I'm not, my, I guess it's\nmy head I'm not wired that way.\n\n511\n00:24:53.842 --> 00:24:55.520\nI cannot look at something and\n\n512\n00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:58.480\nunderstand how to make it work\nin my head in three dimensions.\n\n513\n00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:01.540\nI just I really,\nno kidding I am like totally,\n\n514\n00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:04.570\nI'm not the person you wanna get stranded\non a desert island with if it involves\n\n515\n00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:07.010\nfiguring out geometry to get off,\nwe're dead.\n\n516\n00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:09.940\nYou might as well just jump in the water,\ndrown it'll be quicker.\n\n517\n00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:11.630\nBecause I'm not the person\nthat can help you.\n\n518\n00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:15.060\n&gt;&gt; Adam's IKEA projects always end\nup in flames, so that tells you.\n\n519\n00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:16.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah just-\n&gt;&gt; There's no fire involved.\n\n520\n00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:17.764\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, but\n\n521\n00:25:17.764 --> 00:25:20.204\nthere are things that I'm\nan idiot savant about.\n\n522\n00:25:20.204 --> 00:25:23.254\nI mean, things that other people\nlook at and go, there's no way.\n\n523\n00:25:23.254 --> 00:25:24.350\nAnd I'm like, it's fine.\n\n524\n00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:25.600\nYeah.\nLike, really?\n\n525\n00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.520\nYeah.\nIt's like that moment in Back To School.\n\n526\n00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:28.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Remember at the end,\n\n527\n00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.010\nwhere they're all yelling\nat him in the final.\n\n528\n00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:32.430\nAnd he's gonna run, and Rodney\nDangerfield's sitting there, He's dead.\n\n529\n00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:35.005\nAnd the last thing is like, Four?\n\n530\n00:25:35.005 --> 00:25:36.210\n[LAUGH].\n\n531\n00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:37.320\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's the answer.\n\n532\n00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.660\n&gt;&gt; I've just, that's me.\n\n533\n00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:41.810\nThere are certain things I can\nfigure out that are just, anyway,\n\n534\n00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:42.820\nwe're totally down the rabbit hole.\n\n535\n00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:44.670\n&gt;&gt; This side has gotten\na little bit crazy.\n\n536\n00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:46.850\n&gt;&gt; So let's get back to where we were,\nbecause we are talking about math.\n\n537\n00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:50.480\nSo we talked about prime and co-prime,\nlet's talk about Euler's totient So\n\n538\n00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.150\nEuler's totient is kind of interesting.\n\n539\n00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:55.810\nI know you were talking, you had, I think\nnot necessarily heard about this one.\n\n540\n00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:58.363\nBut I know you were familiar with some\nof the others, the modulus operator.\n\n541\n00:25:58.363 --> 00:25:59.337\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n&gt;&gt; As I said, for instance, so\n\n542\n00:25:59.337 --> 00:26:00.210\nwhich we'll get to in a minute.\n\n543\n00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:03.140\nBut Euler's totient,\nis kind of interesting.\n\n544\n00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:07.060\nThe idea here, right, is that we're\ngonna count the positive integers up for\n\n545\n00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:08.030\na given integer.\n\n546\n00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:10.330\nWe represent that number\ntypically as small n.\n\n547\n00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:12.900\nRemember, I said big N is\ngonna be the natural numbers.\n\n548\n00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:14.600\nSmall n in a formula or\n\n549\n00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:18.030\nnotation is typically referring\nto a variable replaced order for\n\n550\n00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:21.760\na number of something, so twice stress the\nimportance to understand the difference.\n\n551\n00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:25.228\nSo the idea here is that when we think\nabout Euler's totient, essentially what\n\n552\n00:26:25.228 --> 00:26:29.420\nwe're thinking about, is we looking about\nthe numbers that are relatively prime\n\n553\n00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:34.170\nto the number or co-prime to\nthe number associated with that number.\n\n554\n00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:37.360\nI know that sounds kinda confusing,\nlet's think about the logic of this.\n\n555\n00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:39.810\nLet's use, for instance,\nthe number seven, right?\n\n556\n00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:40.960\nSo if you think about the number seven,\n\n557\n00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:44.820\nthere are six numbers that\nare co-prime to seven, right?\n\n558\n00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:48.600\nSix, five, four, three, two, and one.\n\n559\n00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:53.570\nIn other words, all the numbers that come\nbelow that number, all the way down,\n\n560\n00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:56.660\nare co-prime to it because they\nhave nothing in common with it.\n\n561\n00:26:56.660 --> 00:27:00.710\nAnd this is what Euler's totient know\nfactors in common with her, I should say.\n\n562\n00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:02.280\nThis is what Euler's totient represents.\n\n563\n00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.450\nThe idea that we can measure a number and\n\n564\n00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:07.075\nlook at the co-prime\nnumbers associated with it.\n\n565\n00:27:07.075 --> 00:27:13.080\nDerive a value and perhaps use that\nvalue to drive either key creation,\n\n566\n00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:16.350\nmodification, the number of\nround functions we will do,\n\n567\n00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:19.880\nthere are various things that Euler's\ntotient maybe applied for use, use for or\n\n568\n00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:22.200\napply to in a crypto system.\n\n569\n00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:25.900\nBut again it's a mathematical concept,\na rule if you will, right?\n\n570\n00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:29.249\nA standard that we can measure against,\nwe can use.\n\n571\n00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:34.000\nAnd as a result of understanding it,\nwe can apply it in different ways\n\n572\n00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.820\nto the crypto system, deriving certain\nfunction value and/or capability,\n\n573\n00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:40.810\nas a result of use of it and\nknowledge of it.\n\n574\n00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:43.760\nSo it's just another one of those\npieces that gets built into\n\n575\n00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.390\nour understanding of this.\n\n576\n00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:48.655\nAnd it's formerly called\nthe Euler's totient.\n\n577\n00:27:48.655 --> 00:27:51.337\nSo, totient,\nT-O-T-I-E-N-T If you need to spell that,\n\n578\n00:27:51.337 --> 00:27:54.727\nin case somebody stops you on the way home\nand says, tell me how to spell totient?\n\n579\n00:27:54.727 --> 00:27:56.158\nYou'll actually understand that.\n\n580\n00:27:56.158 --> 00:27:56.910\nCuz it's not T-O-E,\n\n581\n00:27:56.910 --> 00:28:00.520\nthe way most people would think,\nas in toe, which I have in my socks.\n\n582\n00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.270\nWe haven't done socks by\nthe way in a long time.\n\n583\n00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:03.590\nCan we do socks real quick?\n\n584\n00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:05.030\n&gt;&gt; He's got at least eight of them.\n\n585\n00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:08.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I do, I can't get it up that\nhigh, maybe we can do the bottom.\n\n586\n00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:09.950\nThe long distance sock cam.\n\n587\n00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:10.800\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n588\n00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:14.750\n&gt;&gt; I am wearing my gray and kind of\npink stripes, which you kind of match.\n\n589\n00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:15.420\n&gt;&gt; Kind of match.\n\n590\n00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:16.228\n&gt;&gt; For sure.\n&gt;&gt; And I am gray.\n\n591\n00:28:16.228 --> 00:28:16.980\n&gt;&gt; And you're gray.\n\n592\n00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:19.130\nSo if we stood together against the wall,\n\n593\n00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:22.210\nwe'll blend in like the chameleon,\nnobody would see us, right?\n\n594\n00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:23.870\nWe'll have to do that jointly.\n\n595\n00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:26.760\nSo let's talk about modulus Operator.\n\n596\n00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.860\nYou told me you were actually\nfamiliar with the modulus operator.\n\n597\n00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:29.700\nRight?\nYou have a sense of that one.\n\n598\n00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:30.360\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nIt's basically\n\n599\n00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.860\nthe remainder of a division problem.\n\n600\n00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:33.030\n&gt;&gt; It is. Yeah. It's exactly that.\n\n601\n00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:34.310\nIt's nothing more than that.\n\n602\n00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:35.430\nIt's a great way of thinking about it.\n\n603\n00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:37.800\nSo we divide two things together.\n\n604\n00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.890\nSo you know, five mod two for\n\n605\n00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:42.540\ninstance which would be how\nwe'd write this mathematically.\n\n606\n00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:46.100\nA number, the word, or\nthe letters M-O-D short for modulus.\n\n607\n00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:48.660\n5 mod 2 equals what?\n\n608\n00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.750\nIt equals 1.\nSo you divide 2 into 5, two times and\n\n609\n00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:52.910\nwhat's the remainder, as you said?\n\n610\n00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:57.270\nThe remainder is what we\nactually spit out on the backend.\n\n611\n00:28:57.270 --> 00:29:01.990\nSo 5 mod 2 = 1 is 5 Modulus 2,\nwhat's the remainder of 5 divided by 2,\n\n612\n00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.530\nremainder is 1.\n\n613\n00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:04.510\n12 mod 5, right?\n\n614\n00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:07.510\nWhat's the remainder of\n12 being divided by 5?\n\n615\n00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:09.260\n12 mod 5 would be 2, right?\n\n616\n00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:12.070\nYeah exactly, so\nthe modulus operator is just\n\n617\n00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:17.210\nthe remainder left over after a division\nof the two principal numbers.\n\n618\n00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:20.630\nWe sometimes symbolize that\nas using a percent sign.\n\n619\n00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:24.480\nSo you sometimes see something\nlike 9 % 2 but spaced out,\n\n620\n00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.750\nright, just in the short\nhand of mathematics.\n\n621\n00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:29.080\nThat equals the modulus operator.\n\n622\n00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.470\nSo it's the same idea.\n\n623\n00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:33.600\nI think you were also comfortable with\nthe concept of the Fibonacci numbers and\n\n624\n00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.620\nthe Fibonacci sequence, right?\n\n625\n00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:35.193\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nI always thought that\n\n626\n00:29:35.193 --> 00:29:35.760\nwas really cool, right?\n\n627\n00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:39.370\nIt's just basically a sequence\nof numbers where each\n\n628\n00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:42.570\nprevious number kinda adds up to\nthe next number in the sequence.\n\n629\n00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:43.690\nOr the last two previous numbers.\n\n630\n00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:45.460\nYeah, right.\n&gt;&gt; Last two previous numbers gives you\n\n631\n00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:46.120\nthe next number.\n\n632\n00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:49.040\nSo you add together the prior two numbers,\nand\n\n633\n00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.250\nthat tells you what the next\nnumber in the sequence will be.\n\n634\n00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:54.060\nSo it is kind of cool, I put the beginning\nof the Fibonacci Sequence in the show\n\n635\n00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:54.980\nnotes for you actually.\n\n636\n00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:59.624\nAnd we're not gonna put it up,\nbut it goes, 1, 1, 2, 3,\n\n637\n00:29:59.624 --> 00:30:02.975\n5, 8, 13, 21, 35, 56, 91.\n\n638\n00:30:02.975 --> 00:30:06.430\nAnd so if you take 91 for\ninstance, just as an example.\n\n639\n00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:13.090\n91 in the Fibonacci sequence is derived\nfrom 35 and 56 which come right before it.\n\n640\n00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:16.480\nAdd 35 and 56 together,\nin other words, right, you get 91.\n\n641\n00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:19.070\nAnd that's how we generate the next one.\n\n642\n00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:24.310\nSo if 35, 56 and\n91 are those three sequence numbers and\n\n643\n00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:26.460\n91 is derived by adding 35 and 56.\n\n644\n00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:29.630\nThen if we add 56 and 91 together, we\n\n645\n00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:32.720\nwould get the next number in the Fibonacci\nSequence, and that's how it works.\n\n646\n00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:38.000\nYou're adding the prior two, and\nthen putting that ultimate output,\n\n647\n00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.690\nright, the resultant there, and then\nyou add the resultant the prior number,\n\n648\n00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:43.070\nand that gives you the next resultant.\n\n649\n00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:44.720\nAnd so it's kind of almost like Frogger,\nright?\n\n650\n00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:45.795\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThat's what [INAUDIBLE]\n\n651\n00:30:45.795 --> 00:30:46.494\n&gt;&gt; It's like Leapfrogger.\n\n652\n00:30:46.494 --> 00:30:47.019\nIt's kind of cool.\n\n653\n00:30:47.019 --> 00:30:48.139\nSo I like the Fibonacci numbers as well.\n\n654\n00:30:48.139 --> 00:30:51.900\nThey're also Kind of cool and they give\nus the ability as we'll talk about in\n\n655\n00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:57.170\nan upcoming episode to use that concept\nto be able to use Fibonacci sequencing or\n\n656\n00:30:57.170 --> 00:31:00.540\nFibonacci numbers to do\nrandom number generation.\n\n657\n00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:04.850\nSo pseudo random number generation PRNG's,\n\n658\n00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:07.050\nwhich are either software or\nhardware based.\n\n659\n00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:10.070\nOne of the ways they may\ngenerate the random sequences and\n\n660\n00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:13.800\nnumbers used to generate keys for\nasymmetric algorithms\n\n661\n00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.540\nis that they may actually use\nthe Fibonacci number sequence.\n\n662\n00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:20.310\nBut obviously extending it out,\nvery, very long sequences.\n\n663\n00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:24.330\nBut by using that thought process\nthey are actually using the points on\n\n664\n00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:29.110\nthe linear sequencing or line of the\nnumbers being generated to generate keys.\n\n665\n00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:32.220\nSo we actually see that being used for\npseudo random number generation.\n\n666\n00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:34.700\nAt least one of the ways we talk about\npseudo random number generation.\n\n667\n00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:35.690\nSo that's kind of cool.\n\n668\n00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:36.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, very cool.\n\n669\n00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:39.200\nAnd that's starting to get a look inside,\nright?\n\n670\n00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.320\nThere's nothing too crazy thus far.\n\n671\n00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:45.320\nI mean, I've seen some of these algorithms\nthat create these encryption schemes.\n\n672\n00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:46.820\nThey are beyond me.\n\n673\n00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:50.100\nThey're probably beyond most people,\nthey're very complex.\n\n674\n00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:54.500\nBut the concepts behind how they're\nworking is very helpful for us, so\n\n675\n00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.790\nthat we can understand at\nleast how they're working,\n\n676\n00:31:56.790 --> 00:32:01.760\nand maybe not necessarily the specifics\nof them, but the concepts behind that.\n\n677\n00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:05.280\nAdam, we're running a little short on time\nso we're gonna have to break this up and\n\n678\n00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:09.060\ncontinue down the asymmetric path,\nas it were.\n\n679\n00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:11.130\nSo but we do thank you for\njoining us thus far.\n\n680\n00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:13.810\nWe thank you guys for\njoining us thus far as well.\n\n681\n00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:17.240\nHopefully we will see you in part\nthree of Asymmetric Cryptography.\n\n682\n00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.560\nAs for this episode,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n683\n00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:21.630\ncall it a day, for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n684\n00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:22.523\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That was kinda cool while you were\n\n11\n00:00:26.037 --> 00:00:27.368\ntalking.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n12\n00:00:27.368 --> 00:00:28.312\n&gt;&gt; That's the new way we're gonna start\n\n13\n00:00:28.312 --> 00:00:28.820\nsaying hello here.\n\n14\n00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.189\nWe're gonna start doing this.\n\n15\n00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.350\nOr we could do this, whatever you prefer.\n\n16\n00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.085\nBut don't do this cuz that's kinda\nhard on the hand on the nose.\n\n17\n00:00:35.085 --> 00:00:37.946\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Anyway, good

00:00:42.741\nWe are glad to have you here!\n\n21\n00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:46.254\nAnd we are excited so we're going to\ncontinue talking about asymmetric\n\n22\n00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:50.090\nencryption, asymmetric cryptography,\nall things asymmetrical.\n\n23\n00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.600\nMeaning we have a public/private key pair\n\n24\n00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.980\nthat we are going to be talking about\nusing and/or interacting around\n\n25\n00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.910\nas opposed to our whole set of\ndiscussions from prior episodes.\n\n26\n00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.985\nDefinitely want to encourage\nyou to go take a look at those.\n\n27\n00:01:00.985 --> 00:01:03.148\nAll of them around symmetric encryption,\n\n28\n00:01:03.148 --> 00:01:05.800\na single key right a private\nkey only solution.\n\n29\n00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.080\nWe're gonna be switching\ngears as we have already for\n\n30\n00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.010\nthe last couple of episodes around this.\n\n31\n00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.465\nWant to remind you if you have not\nseen them yet we went ahead and\n\n32\n00:01:13.465 --> 00:01:14.933\nput together an episode.\n\n33\n00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:18.390\nDaniel and I did that because Cherokee\nwas not here for that particular one.\n\n34\n00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.693\nBut we did an episode specifically as we\nopened up the asymmetric conversation with\n\n35\n00:01:22.693 --> 00:01:26.454\nall the graphics that help us to not\nonly remember symmetry encryption.\n\n36\n00:01:26.454 --> 00:01:28.833\nAlso take a look at digital\nsymmetrism hashes but\n\n37\n00:01:28.833 --> 00:01:31.454\nwe also talked about how\nasymmetry encryption work.\n\n38\n00:01:31.454 --> 00:01:35.251\nBob and joined us for\nthat segment they missed you by the way,\n\n39\n00:01:35.251 --> 00:01:38.852\nthey said to say hello, but\nwe use that as kind of a launching off or\n\n40\n00:01:38.852 --> 00:01:41.433\nthe jumping off point for\nthis conversation.\n\n41\n00:01:41.433 --> 00:01:43.920\nAnd it would be helpful for\nyou to go back, take a look at that.\n\n42\n00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.291\nMake sure you're comfortable with what\nwe're gonna be talking about here, and\n\n43\n00:01:47.291 --> 00:01:48.393\nhow that comes together.\n\n44\n00:01:48.393 --> 00:01:53.224\nAlong with the discussions that Daniel and\nI also had prior to this one with regards\n\n45\n00:01:53.224 --> 00:01:57.950\nto number sequencing, number theory,\nand how we group numbers together.\n\n46\n00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.140\nWhat are natural numbers?\n\n47\n00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.430\nWhat are integers?\n\n48\n00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.175\nWhat are you know, different kinds or\ncategories of numbers that we look at,\n\n49\n00:02:05.175 --> 00:02:07.588\nwhat are primes, what are co-pines.\n\n50\n00:02:07.588 --> 00:02:08.893\n[LAUGH] Co-pines.\nWhat are co-primes,\n\n51\n00:02:08.893 --> 00:02:12.883\nwhat's the modulus operator,\nhow we get through all that background and\n\n52\n00:02:12.883 --> 00:02:15.597\nfoundational knowledge\nthat brings us forward.\n\n53\n00:02:15.597 --> 00:02:20.034\nSo that we can understand how to\nbuild in some of those functions and\n\n54\n00:02:20.034 --> 00:02:22.620\nuse them as we start to derive keys.\n\n55\n00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.275\nWe need to understand the coprime concept,\nthe modulus operator concept,\n\n56\n00:02:26.275 --> 00:02:29.315\nbecause we may use those as we\nactually start generating keys.\n\n57\n00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:30.584\nSo we want to be aware of all that.\n\n58\n00:02:30.584 --> 00:02:32.673\nIt's always important to think\nabout what we've done, so\n\n59\n00:02:32.673 --> 00:02:34.693\nthat we really have a way to\nunderstand how to go forward.\n\n60\n00:02:34.693 --> 00:02:38.598\nAnd make sure that we're able to\nunderstand the knowledge we're discussing,\n\n61\n00:02:38.598 --> 00:02:40.987\nput it into the context of\nthe discussion here but\n\n62\n00:02:40.987 --> 00:02:43.910\nin the broader context overall\nof asymmetric encryption.\n\n63\n00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.760\nSo I invite you to go back,\ntake a look at those.\n\n64\n00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.340\nAnd when you're ready, if you need to take\na pause for a couple minutes do that.\n\n65\n00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.300\nCome on back,\nwe'll be standing here waiting.\n\n66\n00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.839\nWe're gonna play freeze frame,\nwe're not gonna move.\n\n67\n00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:53.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then whichever one moves first,\n\n68\n00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.470\nthey get to do the rest of the episode.\n\n69\n00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.731\nThe other one gets to go sit down.\n\n70\n00:02:56.731 --> 00:02:58.390\nSo don't move, right?\n\n71\n00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.301\nAll right, so we're gonna continue on.\n\n72\n00:03:00.301 --> 00:03:02.265\nWe're gonna talk about the birthday\nproblem or the birthday paradox.\n\n73\n00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:03.779\nI know this is something that Cherokee and\n\n74\n00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:05.790\nI were chatting about\nbefore we got started.\n\n75\n00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.374\nWas of interest to her in particular.\n\n76\n00:03:07.374 --> 00:03:10.169\nI have a funny one, not a funny story,\ncuz if you had to go through it,\n\n77\n00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:10.952\nit wasn't funny.\n\n78\n00:03:10.952 --> 00:03:15.540\nBut for me, I've talked to you\nabout my struggles with math.\n\n79\n00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.068\nYou heard Daniel and\nI in prior episodes, if you saw them,\n\n80\n00:03:18.068 --> 00:03:19.986\nadmit that we both have\nproblems with math.\n\n81\n00:03:19.986 --> 00:03:21.603\nIt's the first step towards recovery,\nby the way,\n\n82\n00:03:21.603 --> 00:03:23.040\nyou must admit you have a problem.\n\n83\n00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.620\nAnd so, we assure you we're not exactly\nmath geniuses by any stretch of\n\n84\n00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.670\nthe imagination.\n\n85\n00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.220\nAnd I have no trouble telling my students\nand my customers this because you're not\n\n86\n00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.550\nasking me for math advice about how to\nfigure out a new mathematical formula.\n\n87\n00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.490\nI'm the first one to tell you\nthat's not my area of expertise.\n\n88\n00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.869\nBut when I was going through graduate\nschool, as anybody who may have gone\n\n89\n00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:46.267\nthrough graduate school will tell you\nif they made it all the way through.\n\n90\n00:03:46.267 --> 00:03:49.248\nYou do have to do a certain amount\nof math, specifically statistics,\n\n91\n00:03:49.248 --> 00:03:50.418\nwhether you like it or not.\n\n92\n00:03:50.418 --> 00:03:53.274\nAnd you have at least one\nstatistics course, in most cases,\n\n93\n00:03:53.274 --> 00:03:56.186\nyou have to go through because\nyou have to understand the basic\n\n94\n00:03:56.186 --> 00:03:59.280\nconcepts to be able to then produce\nreports and things like that.\n\n95\n00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.442\nSo at least in my day many, many moons\nago, when dinosaurs roamed the world,\n\n96\n00:04:03.442 --> 00:04:04.736\nthat was how you did it.\n\n97\n00:04:04.736 --> 00:04:08.788\nAnd so, when I did statistics I actually\nhad to deal with the birthday problem or\n\n98\n00:04:08.788 --> 00:04:12.010\nbirthday paradox,\nit’s a very common statistical problem.\n\n99\n00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.658\nIt’s not related to cryptography directly,\nbut\n\n100\n00:04:14.658 --> 00:04:17.881\nwe borrow it from math,\nbring it in here, and talk about it.\n\n101\n00:04:17.881 --> 00:04:21.216\nBecause the output of\nthis thought process and\n\n102\n00:04:21.216 --> 00:04:27.240\nthe importance of what it represents\nbecomes for us very critical pivot point.\n\n103\n00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.017\nBecause it allows us to\nunderstand our way clear,\n\n104\n00:04:30.017 --> 00:04:33.468\nsee our way clear to understanding\nthat the thought process.\n\n105\n00:04:33.468 --> 00:04:37.836\nAnd the ideas behind the birthday paradox\nmay actually be used to successfully\n\n106\n00:04:37.836 --> 00:04:39.220\nattack crypto system.\n\n107\n00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.400\nSo we're gonna take math,\nwe're gonna relate it to security and\n\n108\n00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.770\ncryptography and\nwe're gonna see how the two exist.\n\n109\n00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.216\nEssentially co-exist and\nhelp us to be better at defending and\n\n110\n00:04:48.216 --> 00:04:50.629\nproviding confidentiality protections.\n\n111\n00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:52.077\nSo that's what we're\ngonna talk about here.\n\n112\n00:04:52.077 --> 00:04:56.416\nSo the birthday problem or birthday\nparadox, common statistics problem,\n\n113\n00:04:56.416 --> 00:05:00.290\nhas nothing directly to do with\ncryptography but indirectly does.\n\n114\n00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.840\nSo let's first talk about the math.\n\n115\n00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.220\nWe pose a question and\n\n116\n00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.200\nif we could go to my machine here\nwe're going to show you that question.\n\n117\n00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.680\nRight up at the top of the scream,\nthe scream [LAUGH] listen to me,\n\n118\n00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.490\nthe screen,\ntalk slowly Adam and enunciate.\n\n119\n00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:13.900\nHow likely it is, or\n\n120\n00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.940\nhow likely is it that only two people in a\nroom of 23 would have the same birth date.\n\n121\n00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.002\nHow likely will it be,\nin other words, is the question.\n\n122\n00:05:21.002 --> 00:05:25.393\nThat we're asking how likely it is that\nany two people in a room randomly.\n\n123\n00:05:25.393 --> 00:05:28.778\nSo if we have 23 people sitting in a room.\n\n124\n00:05:28.778 --> 00:05:32.336\nThe question is, not if I say,\nCherokee you're person number one and\n\n125\n00:05:32.336 --> 00:05:36.195\npotentially Tanisha let's say\nwould be person number two, right?\n\n126\n00:05:36.195 --> 00:05:38.745\nShe's not the room per say but\nshe is here in spirit, right?\n\n127\n00:05:38.745 --> 00:05:43.640\nShe's outside helping us out, so\nif we incorporate her, you and me and\n\n128\n00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.860\nwe're three of those 23 people, right?\n\n129\n00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.165\nAnd we say the two of you is it likely\nthat two of you will have the same\n\n130\n00:05:49.165 --> 00:05:51.664\nbirthday and\nI specifically call out two people.\n\n131\n00:05:51.664 --> 00:05:52.673\nThe likelihood is very,\n\n132\n00:05:52.673 --> 00:05:55.274\nvery small that two of you would\nhave the same birthday, right?\n\n133\n00:05:55.274 --> 00:05:57.295\nAnd the answer is probably not,\nI'm guessing, right?\n\n134\n00:05:57.295 --> 00:05:59.042\n&gt;&gt; Not.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, are you sure?\n\n135\n00:05:59.042 --> 00:06:00.220\nWe haven't asked her, we don't know.\n\n136\n00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.050\nBut I'm guessing.\n\n137\n00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.993\nYou're saying you're sure, I don't know.\n\n138\n00:06:01.993 --> 00:06:02.720\n&gt;&gt; I'm pretty sure.\n\n139\n00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.950\n&gt;&gt; Okay, you're pretty sure, okay.\n\n140\n00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.117\nAll right, did we get an answer\nin the chat to say whether or\n\n141\n00:06:06.117 --> 00:06:07.056\nnot you're sure or not?\n\n142\n00:06:07.056 --> 00:06:08.740\nSo, I'm only kidding, right,\nwe don't know for sure.\n\n143\n00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.076\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't really matter,\n\n144\n00:06:10.076 --> 00:06:11.080\nit's not important.\n\n145\n00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.050\nMy point is that it is very, very small.\n\n146\n00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.320\nThe probability of a likelihood of calling\nout two specific people in this random, or\n\n147\n00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.550\nrather in this pool of 23, would be very,\nvery tiny that we would get a match.\n\n148\n00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.750\nBut if we say, in this pool of 23,\n\n149\n00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.310\nis it likely that only two people\nnot specifically joined but\n\n150\n00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.730\nrandomly any two people in the group of\n23 are likely to have the same birthday.\n\n151\n00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:38.341\nThe probability goes up to 50,\njust about 50%, just over 50%\n\n152\n00:06:38.341 --> 00:06:43.650\nthat two people randomly out of this\ngroup of 23 will have the same birthday.\n\n153\n00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:48.401\nThis is the birthday birthday paradox,\nbirthday problem conundrum that we work\n\n154\n00:06:48.401 --> 00:06:52.111\nthrough in statistics because as we\ngo through and we work out the math.\n\n155\n00:06:52.111 --> 00:06:55.692\nAnd we're going to spare you all the math,\nif you want to see all the math, and\n\n156\n00:06:55.692 --> 00:06:58.558\nit's a little involved,\njust go out and Google, or go out and\n\n157\n00:06:58.558 --> 00:07:01.030\nlook up birthday paradox or\nbirthday problem.\n\n158\n00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.950\nYou'll find multiple sites literally,\nall sorts of math sites out there,\n\n159\n00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.580\na lot of them have great explanations.\n\n160\n00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.726\nThey walk you through the detailed math,\nbut\n\n161\n00:07:08.726 --> 00:07:11.278\nthere's a lot of calculation\nthat has to take place.\n\n162\n00:07:11.278 --> 00:07:14.760\nThere's also some really cool online\ncalculators that you can use, that will\n\n163\n00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:18.150\nessentially create all the math for\nyou and give you all the probabilities.\n\n164\n00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:21.280\nSo it just kinda hides all the math and\nspits out the answers for you.\n\n165\n00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.980\nSo I encourage you to take a look at that,\nbut you could see I put together up here,\n\n166\n00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:29.530\nthe fact that if we have to do the math\nand figure out the total possible number\n\n167\n00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:32.590\nof combinations among\nthe group of 23 people, right?\n\n168\n00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:34.283\nWe need a lot of fingers and\ntoes for this one.\n\n169\n00:07:34.283 --> 00:07:38.653\nYou got to add 22 plus 21 plus\n20 all the way down to represent\n\n170\n00:07:38.653 --> 00:07:42.637\nall the possible combinations together and\nwe get 253.\n\n171\n00:07:42.637 --> 00:07:46.650\nSo there's 253 potential combinations.\n\n172\n00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:51.548\nWays in which we can combine 23 people\nuniquely in that room to figure out\n\n173\n00:07:51.548 --> 00:07:52.899\nwhat all of this is.\n\n174\n00:07:52.899 --> 00:07:56.579\nAnd then when we look at that,\nright, we go through and\n\n175\n00:07:56.579 --> 00:08:01.059\nwe understand ultimately that\n[COUGH] When we look at probability,\n\n176\n00:08:01.059 --> 00:08:05.859\nclearly, right, if we say that\nthe number of people goes up to 367,\n\n177\n00:08:05.859 --> 00:08:09.660\nas I point out in the next\nlittle block of text there.\n\n178\n00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:12.800\nBecause there's only 366\npossible birthdays in a year\n\n179\n00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.290\nif you include leap years.\n\n180\n00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:17.750\nWe discount leap year,\nthen there's only 365, right?\n\n181\n00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.460\nNormally most years February\nonly goes to 28 days, right?\n\n182\n00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:23.430\nBut we have a leap year and\nwhen we do we have February 29th.\n\n183\n00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:27.633\nSo if you include that,\n366 possible birthdays.\n\n184\n00:08:27.633 --> 00:08:29.448\nIf you put 367 people in a room,\n\n185\n00:08:29.448 --> 00:08:33.990\nyou got 100% guarantee that randomly\ntwo people will have the same birthday.\n\n186\n00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:37.260\nBecause you've represented\nevery possible thought process,\n\n187\n00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:41.910\nevery possible day would be\nrepresented there in some way, right?\n\n188\n00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:46.746\nBut look at that,\n99.9% probability with just 70 people.\n\n189\n00:08:46.746 --> 00:08:47.356\n&gt;&gt; Pretty good.\n\n190\n00:08:47.356 --> 00:08:53.160\n&gt;&gt; So, essentially, 70 people is\njust as good as four times as much.\n\n191\n00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Five times as much, in theory, right?\n\n192\n00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:59.120\nBecause when you think about it,\nwith 70 people randomly associating,\n\n193\n00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.730\nthe probability is almost 100% you'll\nget two people with the same birthday.\n\n194\n00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:06.270\nWhen we go down to only 23 people,\nwe're just over 50%.\n\n195\n00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.970\nIt's about 50.14 or something like that.\n\n196\n00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:11.290\nSo if we use this thought process,\n\n197\n00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:16.255\nbased on the statistical\nprobability of randomly matching\n\n198\n00:09:16.255 --> 00:09:21.730\ntwo people out of those 253 combinations\nto find the right birthday match.\n\n199\n00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:26.650\nAnd we apply that to cryptography and\nsay, given the fact that we can do this,\n\n200\n00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:29.110\nthe birthday attack,\nwhich is what we name this approach.\n\n201\n00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:32.860\nYou could see there, used to refer to\na class of brute force attacks based on\n\n202\n00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.900\nthis likelihood and\nthis outcome and this probability.\n\n203\n00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:39.110\nIf we do this, the idea then becomes,\nlet me just scroll down so\n\n204\n00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:41.240\nthat you can see this real\nquick while we're talking.\n\n205\n00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:47.630\nIf we do this you can see right here,\nright, that\n\n206\n00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:52.090\nwhen we apply this to cryptography, we can\nuse the same idea and say, you know what?\n\n207\n00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:53.940\nWe don't need the entire key space.\n\n208\n00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:56.540\nWe don't need all 4 gazillion.\n\n209\n00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:00.590\nIt's a really big word, by the way, right,\nand a really big number, 4 gazillion keys.\n\n210\n00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:05.250\nWhat we need instead is a subset of\nthat that represents the likelihood\n\n211\n00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:09.080\nthat there's a match because of the\nprobabilities that the birthday attack or\n\n212\n00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.780\nbirthday paradox are built on.\n\n213\n00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.470\nAnd so when we have an encryption\nalgorithm with a key space,\n\n214\n00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:16.780\nlet's say of 32 bits,\njust as an example here, right?\n\n215\n00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.640\nSo a key space of 32 bits.\n\n216\n00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.970\nWe could generate this number of keys.\n\n217\n00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:23.730\nNow this is not a number here and\nnot the sign for Verizon.\n\n218\n00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:25.440\nI know it's kid of off to\nthe side it's hard to see.\n\n219\n00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.960\nThat's the best way I could\nrepresent the square root, right?\n\n220\n00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.242\nSo this is indicating the square\nroot of this number of keys.\n\n221\n00:10:31.242 --> 00:10:37.523\nThis is 4,294,967,295 random keys\nexist in a 32-bit key space,\n\n222\n00:10:37.523 --> 00:10:42.802\nmeaning the total number of possibly\nunique combinations of all keys\n\n223\n00:10:42.802 --> 00:10:48.184\nin a 32-bit key space is 4.3 billion,\napproximately, right?\n\n224\n00:10:48.184 --> 00:10:50.371\nWhen we take the square root of that,\n\n225\n00:10:50.371 --> 00:10:55.350\nwe get about 65,000-ish number of keys,\napproximately, 65,535.\n\n226\n00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:59.130\nWith that, we have a 50% chance\nof finding the right key\n\n227\n00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:02.640\nin that subset because of the likelihood\nor the probability of the matches.\n\n228\n00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.090\nBecause what we're doing is,\nwe're eliminating,\n\n229\n00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:09.860\nright, the fact that roughly half\nthe keys out of that total key set\n\n230\n00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:13.450\nare probably going to be\nderivatives of the other keys.\n\n231\n00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:15.690\nThey're very close, in other words, right?\n\n232\n00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:18.990\nAnd we can eliminate a certain number\nof them and say, you know what,\n\n233\n00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:22.275\nwe're gonna get a guaranteed match\nout of a smaller set, most likely.\n\n234\n00:11:22.275 --> 00:11:24.285\nCuz we don't have to\nrandomly sample every key.\n\n235\n00:11:24.285 --> 00:11:27.255\nWe have to randomly sample\nthe right subset of keys.\n\n236\n00:11:27.255 --> 00:11:31.705\nAnd so when we think about this, and\nwe look through the lens of the birthday\n\n237\n00:11:31.705 --> 00:11:34.555\nproblem, or the probability of\nthe birthday problem that it presents for\n\n238\n00:11:34.555 --> 00:11:38.057\nus, we can see that we can actually\ntry a much smaller set of keys.\n\n239\n00:11:38.057 --> 00:11:41.559\nAnd there's a likelihood in that small\nset that we may find the right key,\n\n240\n00:11:41.559 --> 00:11:45.303\ndepending on the number that we've put\nin there, if we get to a critical mass.\n\n241\n00:11:45.303 --> 00:11:48.280\nSo for a guaranteed match,\nwe have to do every key, right?\n\n242\n00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:52.017\nWe have to literally try every key to\nguarantee 100% that we're gonna find it.\n\n243\n00:11:52.017 --> 00:11:53.540\n&gt;&gt; A numbers game.\n\n244\n00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:54.480\n&gt;&gt; It is a numbers game,\n\n245\n00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:59.010\nbut the idea would be that we have a good\nchance of getting a match with the subset.\n\n246\n00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:00.913\nThat good chance may be 50%.\n\n247\n00:12:00.913 --> 00:12:02.970\nIt may be that we're\nnot gonna get a match.\n\n248\n00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:06.630\nBecause for every key we try, there's\na yes or no, good or bad or a positive or\n\n249\n00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:07.650\nnegative outcome.\n\n250\n00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:13.170\nBut the idea is that it's,\ninstead of having to try 4.3 billion keys,\n\n251\n00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:17.390\nif we try a subset there's\na 50% likelihood in that subset\n\n252\n00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:19.778\nthat we will actually\nfind the right match.\n\n253\n00:12:19.778 --> 00:12:23.660\nAnd that's the probability we use to start\ndoing these attacks because if you think\n\n254\n00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:28.910\nabout it, while we could, with modern\ncomputers, we could 4.3 billion.\n\n255\n00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:32.050\nIf you do the math,\nlet's say hypothetically, you can do so\n\n256\n00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:33.250\nmany keys a second.\n\n257\n00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:34.250\nSo many keys a minute.\n\n258\n00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:35.110\nSo many keys an hour.\n\n259\n00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:36.270\nSo many keys a day.\n\n260\n00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.820\nYou can work out the math and\nsay how long that would take.\n\n261\n00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:43.440\nAnd it's probably not an unrealistic\namount of time, which is why a 32-bit key,\n\n262\n00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:47.300\nit's so small we don't think about\nthat as being realistic to use today.\n\n263\n00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.919\nIt could be broken in probably an hour or\nless.\n\n264\n00:12:49.919 --> 00:12:51.380\nIt's not gonna take very long.\n\n265\n00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:55.338\nBut the very strong key strings we'd\nbeen talking about that you see,\n\n266\n00:12:55.338 --> 00:12:57.902\ntalked about for instance with AES, right?\n\n267\n00:12:57.902 --> 00:13:00.030\n128, 192, 256 bits.\n\n268\n00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.535\nSignificantly larger than 32 bits and you\nthink about how many keys are in a 32-bit\n\n269\n00:13:06.535 --> 00:13:09.184\nkey space, what about a 256-key bit space.\n\n270\n00:13:09.184 --> 00:13:12.869\nIt's gonna be not just billions, but\ntrillions and out beyond that probably,\n\n271\n00:13:12.869 --> 00:13:14.400\nright, very, very big.\n\n272\n00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.625\nSo to try that number and\nget a guaranteed lock,\n\n273\n00:13:17.625 --> 00:13:21.210\n100% guaranteed we're gonna find the key,\nthere's no doubt about it we can do that.\n\n274\n00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:22.730\nBut it would take such a long time,\n\n275\n00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:26.110\nas we've talk about in some of these\nother conversations in other episodes,\n\n276\n00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:30.300\nthat it's unrealistic that it would\nhappen in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n277\n00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:31.880\nAnd as a result, we say you know what?\n\n278\n00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.270\nWhile you could do it, good luck.\n\n279\n00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:35.210\nLet us know how that turns out.\n\n280\n00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:39.430\nChances are good even if you try it,\nyou're very unlikely to be successful\n\n281\n00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:43.210\nin anything approaching real time or what\nwe would call a realistic amount of time.\n\n282\n00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:46.050\nBut if we use the probabilities\nof the birthday problem,\n\n283\n00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:48.860\nwe actually may be able to\nattack a subset of the keys,\n\n284\n00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:51.420\npotentially finding a match\nin a lot less time.\n\n285\n00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:54.095\nAnd this is the thought process\nbehind the birthday attack.\n\n286\n00:13:54.095 --> 00:13:56.640\nIt's kind of interesting when you\nthink about the logic of this, right?\n\n287\n00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:00.966\nAnd we make this point a couple of\ndifferent ways in our conversations.\n\n288\n00:14:00.966 --> 00:14:04.636\nAnd we talk about the fact that\n[COUGH] it's important for\n\n289\n00:14:04.636 --> 00:14:09.516\nus to understand that reasonable time\nis what we're after here, right?\n\n290\n00:14:09.516 --> 00:14:13.370\nAnd we want to understand and know this,\nbecause given enough time and\n\n291\n00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:18.370\nenough resources, any encryption,\nno matter how secure it is, can be broken.\n\n292\n00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:20.240\nWe have to be clear and\nunequivocal about this.\n\n293\n00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:24.930\nThere's no such thing as any kind of\nsystem that cannot be broken given enough\n\n294\n00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:28.628\ntime and\nenough opportunity to attack the system.\n\n295\n00:14:28.628 --> 00:14:32.180\nEven a one-time pad, which we have said\nin other shows and other episodes,\n\n296\n00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:36.620\nis the truly only unbreakable crypto\nsystem available to us today.\n\n297\n00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:40.470\nEven then, if you had enough time and\nunlimited resources,\n\n298\n00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:44.960\nyou could throw enough solutions at\nthat that you would find the key.\n\n299\n00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:50.300\nBut you would find the key, a key,\nonly one key that unencrypts one message.\n\n300\n00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:54.810\nBecause remember in a one-time pad,\nyou're talking about every message being\n\n301\n00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:58.720\nencrypted and decrypted with its own\nindividual key that's thrown away and,\n\n302\n00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.360\nin theory, not reused again.\n\n303\n00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.390\nSo even then, we could get lucky.\n\n304\n00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:06.220\nBut the reality is, even if we broke\nthat cryptosystem, we broke it for\n\n305\n00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:07.270\nonly one message.\n\n306\n00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:09.476\nWhat about the 100 messages came before or\nafter that one?\n\n307\n00:15:09.476 --> 00:15:11.580\nThey'd be encrypted with different keys.\n\n308\n00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:15.820\nAnd so, we always wanna understand\nthat there is the likelihood\n\n309\n00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.770\nthat a cryptosystem can be broken.\n\n310\n00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:22.100\nThe question is, how likely is it to be\nbroken in what we would consider to be\n\n311\n00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:23.790\na reasonable amount of time?\n\n312\n00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:27.590\nAnd if that reasonable amount of time\nis outside the retention period and\n\n313\n00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.970\nthe data's gone through\nits normal lifecycle and\n\n314\n00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:34.650\nwe have disposed of that data securely and\nproperly, who cares?\n\n315\n00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:36.460\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; At that point, it's irrelevant.\n\n316\n00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.620\nThe data's no longer important.\n\n317\n00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:42.010\nWe don't consider it to be viable anymore.\n\n318\n00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:43.145\nGo ahead and read it, who cares?\n\n319\n00:15:43.145 --> 00:15:44.730\nThere's no value in that, right?\n\n320\n00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:47.000\nBut if you broke it within\nthe retention period,\n\n321\n00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.700\nsay the retention period was a year.\n\n322\n00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:52.469\nTook you half a year to break it,\nthat cryptosystem is not valid, right?\n\n323\n00:15:52.469 --> 00:15:55.620\nIts not set up, its not done\nthe right way, its not strong enough.\n\n324\n00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:59.699\nBut if you break it a year and\na half after the retention period expires.\n\n325\n00:15:59.699 --> 00:16:02.521\nYeah, we just don't care, it's just\nnot worth our time and effort anymore.\n\n326\n00:16:02.521 --> 00:16:05.197\nSo we do want to make that distinction and\nunderstand that,\n\n327\n00:16:05.197 --> 00:16:07.720\nit is a very important\nthought process here.\n\n328\n00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.590\nI want to move on and talk a little bit\nabout pseudo random number generators.\n\n329\n00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:12.980\nI want to specifically talk about\nwhat's on the screen here for\n\n330\n00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:15.380\na minute,\nbecause this is kind of interesting.\n\n331\n00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:18.570\nThe German federal office for\ninformation, it's called BSI.\n\n332\n00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:22.672\nAnd where this standard that we use for\nunderstanding what PRNGs, or\n\n333\n00:16:22.672 --> 00:16:26.380\npseudo-random number generators\nare suitable for cryptography,\n\n334\n00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:29.170\none of the main standards we measure\nagainst, where it comes from.\n\n335\n00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:31.620\nIt's kind of interesting, and we'll talk\nabout the history of this in a second.\n\n336\n00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:36.070\nBut the idea of pseudo-random number\ngeneration, so what we want to think about\n\n337\n00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:40.020\nis the fact that we need, clearly, to be\nable to generate keys that are strong,\n\n338\n00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:43.460\nthat are secure, that are obviously big\nenough that they could withstand attacks.\n\n339\n00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:46.350\nUnlikely to be found,\nvery large key space, right?\n\n340\n00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:50.160\nHide in plain sight but have all those\nkeys around us, so that no matter who\n\n341\n00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.010\njumps in there randomly,\nvery unlikely they'll pull the right key.\n\n342\n00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:55.930\nAnd have the word factors we talked about,\nbe very high, right?\n\n343\n00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:58.790\nSo long, so much time involved,\n\n344\n00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:01.620\nunrealistic to break the cryptography\nin a reasonable amount of time.\n\n345\n00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.260\nWe've talked about these terms and\nwhy they are important, right?\n\n346\n00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.850\nSo we just want to remind ourselves\nof this as we get started, but\n\n347\n00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:11.740\nthe downfall of most crypto systems, even\nthe most modern ones is the ability to\n\n348\n00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:16.080\nbe truly random and generate randomness\nin every area that we leave it in.\n\n349\n00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:19.840\nNow I said truly random a minute ago,\nyou didn't call me on this and\n\n350\n00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:23.150\neverybody out there may or may not have,\nbut there's no such thing.\n\n351\n00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:26.150\nNo such thing as a truly random system.\n\n352\n00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:27.640\n&gt;&gt; What about a one time pad?\n\n353\n00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.610\n&gt;&gt; Even a one time pad.\n\n354\n00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:33.570\nBecause the problem is the implementation\nof that system is likely\n\n355\n00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:38.410\nto not be 100% standardized the way we\nwould thing of it as needed to be where\n\n356\n00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:41.050\nevery key is used one time,\nthrown away, never used again,\n\n357\n00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:44.560\nand that those pads stay synchronized and\nthere's no exposure.\n\n358\n00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:47.200\nIf we could achieve that,\nit would be a random\n\n359\n00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.860\nsystem in the sense that they keys\nthemselves are only used once.\n\n360\n00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:55.850\nBut here's the underside of that,\nhow randomly generated were those keys?\n\n361\n00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:59.510\nIt's not the system, it's the generation\nof the keys that we focus on.\n\n362\n00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:03.950\nThe problem we have with random\ngeneration, is that it's almost impossible\n\n363\n00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:09.480\nto achieve a truly random solution or\nsystem that generates something.\n\n364\n00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:15.540\nIn other words even the most seemingly\nrandom series of events and inputs as\n\n365\n00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:20.730\nvalues tend to as we find and we look at\nand we analyze over time develop patterns.\n\n366\n00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:23.700\nSo when we implement pseudo\nrandom number generators\n\n367\n00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.220\ntypically they're done in software,\nthey are not random,\n\n368\n00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:29.360\nthat's why we call them pseudo-random,\nthey're not true random.\n\n369\n00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.610\nWe could approach to\nrandomness using hardware,\n\n370\n00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:34.660\nand there are different ways to\nimplement random number generators.\n\n371\n00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:39.120\nBut with software,\nwe really can't achieve true randomness.\n\n372\n00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.860\nSo we talk about those\nbeing labeled as PRNGs,\n\n373\n00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:44.810\nor pseudo-random number generators,\nas opposed to TR,\n\n374\n00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:48.310\ntrue random number generators, because we\ndon't implement them through hardware.\n\n375\n00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:50.680\nEven the background noise,\nthe white noise in the universe.\n\n376\n00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:55.280\nSo from the earliest point of creation\nhas been shown, as NASA and other\n\n377\n00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:59.530\nscientific bodies around the world have\ndone analysis on this, looking for new and\n\n378\n00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:04.400\ninnovative ways to potentially leverage\nrandomness, to generate these keys.\n\n379\n00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.710\nThey've examined the background noise and\nthe patterns and\n\n380\n00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:08.730\nthere's actually a pattern there.\n\n381\n00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:10.990\nThere is some sort of pattern,\nthere is not true random.\n\n382\n00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:15.390\nSee even in that and as a result, we're\nfinding in nature that everything has\n\n383\n00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:18.890\na pattern at some level, that it's\nalmost impossible if not impossible\n\n384\n00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:22.280\nto actually find something that is truly,\ntruly random.\n\n385\n00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.250\nSo because of this, we run into an issue,\na fundamental block.\n\n386\n00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:28.520\nAt a certain point, everything repeats and\n\n387\n00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.880\nbecause of that we can't really\ntruly create random numbers,\n\n388\n00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:35.500\nwe can only approach or\napproximate that random generation.\n\n389\n00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:40.450\nAnd because of that, the implied issue\nthere is that everything we generate,\n\n390\n00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:41.290\nevery key we generate,\n\n391\n00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:45.580\nevery random generator we use has some\nsort of pattern associated with it.\n\n392\n00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:50.030\nWe may not know what it is, may be hard\nfor us to figure it out, but pseudo random\n\n393\n00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:53.290\nnumber generators, algorithms that\ncan create long runs of numbers.\n\n394\n00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:55.940\nBut notice it doesn't say infinitesimal,\nright?\n\n395\n00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:57.330\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Forever, going on to infinite,\n\n396\n00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:58.880\nwith good random properties, but\n\n397\n00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:03.170\neventually that sequence does repeat,\nthat's the challenge.\n\n398\n00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:05.630\nAnd so we talk about\npseudo-random number generation.\n\n399\n00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:08.790\nSo as a result what we need to\nunderstand is the following.\n\n400\n00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:12.180\nThere are several different standards\nout there that we can measure against.\n\n401\n00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:15.632\nBut the German Federal Office for\nInformation Security, it's called BSI,\n\n402\n00:20:15.632 --> 00:20:19.094\nhas established four criteria for\nthe quality of random number generators.\n\n403\n00:20:19.094 --> 00:20:23.361\nWe measure, in other words,\nagainst these criteria, K1, K2, K3, K4.\n\n404\n00:20:23.361 --> 00:20:28.562\nIn order for a PNRG, a pseudo number or\npseudo random number generator\n\n405\n00:20:28.562 --> 00:20:33.675\nto be considered acceptable for\ncryptography it must meet the K1 and\n\n406\n00:20:33.675 --> 00:20:38.190\nK2 standards to be ranked a K3 or\nK4, or it cannot be used.\n\n407\n00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:42.990\nSo in other words, if all the pseudo\nrandom number generator does is what's\n\n408\n00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:46.730\ndetailed down in the K1 or\nK2 areas, it's not good enough.\n\n409\n00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:50.560\nIt may be good for\nthings like slot machine and other stuff.\n\n410\n00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.630\nAnd we use pseudo random\nnumber generators for\n\n411\n00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:55.380\nthose kinds of machines for\nobvious reasons, so we\n\n412\n00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:59.620\ncan randomly generate patterns that will\nspin the wheel and say okay stop here.\n\n413\n00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:01.570\nThat kind of thing when we're\ndoing the digital ones today,\n\n414\n00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:03.340\nnot the mechanical ones,\nright, he old ones.\n\n415\n00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:05.280\nBut the new ones that are digital,\n\n416\n00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:08.000\nthey actually use pseudo\nrandom number generators, so\n\n417\n00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.520\nthey're constantly generating random\npatterns to see whether or not you win.\n\n418\n00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:16.050\nSo there are reasons why some of these,\nright, may be used at a lower level.\n\n419\n00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:19.910\nBut for cryptography, where somebody's\ngonna just beat on this thing unmercifully\n\n420\n00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:21.870\nover time,\nit's gotta meet a higher standard.\n\n421\n00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:25.010\nSo you could see the four standards here,\nK1, K2,\n\n422\n00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:28.060\nK3, K4, definitely want to make sure\nyou're familiar with them if you're\n\n423\n00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:31.650\nplanning on studying for\nan attempt to take the ECES exam.\n\n424\n00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:33.750\nMay be helpful to know what they are.\n\n425\n00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:37.800\nShould be very helpful and important for\nyou to be aware of the fact that we need\n\n426\n00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:41.920\nto meet the K3 and K4 standard barrier or\nthat bar, we need to be over.\n\n427\n00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:44.960\nAccording to the German BSI\nstandard to be suitable\n\n428\n00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:49.030\nif a PRNG is going to be\nclassified as being acceptable for\n\n429\n00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:51.750\nuse in a cryptographic solution,\nit must meet these standards.\n\n430\n00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:54.230\nSo wanna make sure you're familiar\nwith that, just so that you know,\n\n431\n00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:55.160\nit's interesting.\n\n432\n00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.760\nGo out and\nyou can Google the BSI standard,\n\n433\n00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.440\nyou'll find the references for it.\n\n434\n00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.320\nThere's a PDF out there, one in English,\nthere is one in German, but\n\n435\n00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.920\nyou would obviously have to know German\nto be able to speak it, to read it.\n\n436\n00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:08.530\nBut there's an English standard that\nis essentially the translation of that.\n\n437\n00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:10.620\nYou can find a PDF form you can download.\n\n438\n00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:12.250\nAnd if you're interested,\nyou can take a look at it.\n\n439\n00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:16.030\nAnd you could see, among all the things\nthat are there, it's about a 30 or\n\n440\n00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:17.150\n40 page standard.\n\n441\n00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:20.070\nThey go through all the math and how they\nderive all this, but they actually lay\n\n442\n00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:23.230\nout the logic behind these levels and\nwhy they're set up the way they are.\n\n443\n00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:24.260\nIt's kind of interesting.\n\n444\n00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:28.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so Adam, I know these\nare German-based, but in the industry,\n\n445\n00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:32.270\nare these levels accepted\nas just common terminology?\n\n446\n00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:34.580\n&gt;&gt; Many systems will relate to this.\n\n447\n00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:38.070\nThere are other standards worldwide, but\nthis is one of the more common ones, so\n\n448\n00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:41.280\nit's not the only one, but it's a very\nwell known one, let's put it that way.\n\n449\n00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:45.520\nIt is one that is often referenced, so\nyou will see it very often, to your point,\n\n450\n00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:46.500\nabsolutely.\n\n451\n00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.650\nAll right so let's talk about\njust a couple other things.\n\n452\n00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:51.790\nWanna talk about some examples of\npseudo random number generators.\n\n453\n00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:54.960\nGot some names here for you,\nsome different ways in which we do this.\n\n454\n00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:59.440\nThere's a whole list here, you have\nNaor-Reingold, you have Mersenne Twister,\n\n455\n00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.760\nor Mersenne Twister I guess\ndepending on how you pronounce it.\n\n456\n00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:05.720\nA Linear Congruential Generator,\nthat's a fun one to say.\n\n457\n00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.900\nLehmer Random Number Generator,\n\n458\n00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:12.650\nwhich is commonly referred to as a twisted\ngeneralized feedback shift register.\n\n459\n00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:15.799\nAnd then we have what is known\nas the Lag Fibonacci Generator.\n\n460\n00:23:15.799 --> 00:23:19.568\nWe talked about Fibonacci number sequences\nin one of the prior episodes here,\n\n461\n00:23:19.568 --> 00:23:22.034\nactually the one right before this,\nDaniel and I.\n\n462\n00:23:22.034 --> 00:23:23.804\nSo you want to be talking about or\n\n463\n00:23:23.804 --> 00:23:26.760\nthinking about what\nthe Fibonacci sequence is.\n\n464\n00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.810\nThe idea behind the Fibonacci numbers,\nremember, you are gonna be able to add\n\n465\n00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:34.650\nthe prior two numbers together\nto get the next number, right?\n\n466\n00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:39.270\nSo the idea is if let's say we\nsay I think was, what was it?\n\n467\n00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:41.291\nI have to go look at my\nnotes real quick and\n\n468\n00:23:41.291 --> 00:23:43.966\nI'll remember the sequence\nof the top of my head, but\n\n469\n00:23:43.966 --> 00:23:47.543\nif we take a look at the Fibonacci\nsequence, so there it is right there.\n\n470\n00:23:47.543 --> 00:23:48.973\nSo if we say for instance,\n\n471\n00:23:48.973 --> 00:23:53.722\nthe end of the Fibonacci sequence that we\ntalked about was 35 and 56, the initial.\n\n472\n00:23:53.722 --> 00:23:58.874\nSeven or eight lines of the sequence,\n1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 35, 56.\n\n473\n00:23:58.874 --> 00:24:02.947\nSo if we said 35 and\n56 were the last two in the sequence,\n\n474\n00:24:02.947 --> 00:24:08.094\nwhere we stopped, if we added 35 and\n56 together that generates 91.\n\n475\n00:24:08.094 --> 00:24:10.660\nThat's the next number in\nthe Fibonacci sequence.\n\n476\n00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:15.010\nThen we would add 56 and 91 together to\ngenerate the next number in the sequence.\n\n477\n00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:18.320\nThat's the pattern,\nthat's how the Fibonacci sequence works.\n\n478\n00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:22.241\nSo we're using that thought process for\nlag Fibonacci generators,\n\n479\n00:24:22.241 --> 00:24:25.290\nto randomly or\npseudo-randomly generate numbers.\n\n480\n00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:27.840\nThat's the idea behind this technology.\n\n481\n00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:30.390\nWe're not obviously using\nthe easily-derived ones.\n\n482\n00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:36.070\nWe're using some crazy long big ones that\nhappen a mile or two down the road, right?\n\n483\n00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:38.080\nBut that's the thought process here.\n\n484\n00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.992\nAnd so if we use addition, if we're adding\nWe call it an additive lag Fibonacci\n\n485\n00:24:41.992 --> 00:24:44.264\ngenerator, it's commonly called an ALFG.\n\n486\n00:24:44.264 --> 00:24:47.936\nIf we're multiplying which we can\ndo as well cuz it holds true for\n\n487\n00:24:47.936 --> 00:24:52.084\nmultiplication we're doing what's\ncalled the multiplicative lagged\n\n488\n00:24:52.084 --> 00:24:54.603\nFibonacci generator or\nMLFG as you can see.\n\n489\n00:24:54.603 --> 00:24:57.478\nIf we add an XOR operation,\nadd an exclusive or\n\n490\n00:24:57.478 --> 00:25:02.515\nwe're calling it a two-tap generalized\nshift back register or commonly a GFS.\n\n491\n00:25:02.515 --> 00:25:04.568\n&gt;&gt; Thank goodness for acronyms.\n\n492\n00:25:04.568 --> 00:25:06.216\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just to know-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n493\n00:25:06.216 --> 00:25:07.121\n&gt;&gt; Had I known when\n\n494\n00:25:07.121 --> 00:25:10.676\nI started down this road as\na security professional that this\n\n495\n00:25:10.676 --> 00:25:14.560\nis what I was gonna actually have\nto learn how to do and speak?\n\n496\n00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.031\nI would have probably thought\ndifferently about my career choice.\n\n497\n00:25:17.031 --> 00:25:21.809\nNot because I don't like what I do, but\nbecause literally we have an acronym for\n\n498\n00:25:21.809 --> 00:25:22.676\neverything.\n\n499\n00:25:22.676 --> 00:25:24.528\n&gt;&gt; Yes [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As you're about to see with some of\n\n500\n00:25:24.528 --> 00:25:25.780\nthe other ones we have here.\n\n501\n00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:30.655\nSo let's just talk about some of the other\nasymmetric algorithms that exist as well.\n\n502\n00:25:30.655 --> 00:25:32.380\nDiffie-Hellmann is the most popular one,\nor\n\n503\n00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:33.860\none of the most popular\nones you often hear about.\n\n504\n00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:37.200\nIt actually holds the title of\ndistinction, being the first publically\n\n505\n00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:41.000\ndescribed asymmetric algorithm,\nwhich is kinda cool in and of itself.\n\n506\n00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.358\nSo it is the one that everybody points\nto initially, and it's interesting,\n\n507\n00:25:45.358 --> 00:25:49.047\nhistorically it's not actually\nthe very first cryptographic or\n\n508\n00:25:49.047 --> 00:25:52.536\nasymmetric cryptographic\nalgorithm that was produced, but\n\n509\n00:25:52.536 --> 00:25:55.976\nthe one's that were produced\nthat did similar work to this.\n\n510\n00:25:55.976 --> 00:25:57.338\nUnfortunately, it never\nsaw the light of day.\n\n511\n00:25:57.338 --> 00:26:02.253\nBecause they were produced by, and\nprimarily because they were produced by\n\n512\n00:26:02.253 --> 00:26:06.629\npeople working for the British\nequivalent of our either NSA, CIA,\n\n513\n00:26:06.629 --> 00:26:10.310\nwhatever you wanna call it\nthe MI6 branch is there.\n\n514\n00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:13.000\nBut people in those spy\nagencies in Britain and\n\n515\n00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.160\nthe UK actually had done work on this\nroughly around the same time and\n\n516\n00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:20.420\nbeat Diffie and Helmann to\nthe punch with some of these exact.\n\n517\n00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:24.428\nThought processes and created some of\nthese exact asymmetric algorithms for\n\n518\n00:26:24.428 --> 00:26:28.261\nkey exchange but they never saw the light\nof day cuz they were classified.\n\n519\n00:26:28.261 --> 00:26:32.081\nAnd it didn't come out til years later\nhistorically that the gentlemen who were\n\n520\n00:26:32.081 --> 00:26:35.111\nbehind these things actually\nshould be given credit for them.\n\n521\n00:26:35.111 --> 00:26:38.983\nDiffie-Helmann rightfully deserve the\ncredit they got and nobody's taking that\n\n522\n00:26:38.983 --> 00:26:42.970\naway from them, but there were people\nthat actually did this before they did.\n\n523\n00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:45.086\nThey just were not in the public eye.\n\n524\n00:26:45.086 --> 00:26:47.190\nAnd so there's just some\ninteresting history here.\n\n525\n00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:49.162\nAs you go back and\nread up on the history of cryptography.\n\n526\n00:26:49.162 --> 00:26:52.382\nAbout, as we said in some other episodes,\nwhere some of this stuff comes from.\n\n527\n00:26:52.382 --> 00:26:53.796\nIt's kinda cool and\nspooky at the same time, right?\n\n528\n00:26:53.796 --> 00:26:54.381\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n529\n00:26:54.381 --> 00:26:57.495\n&gt;&gt; Two people diverge on a path\nin a forest right one goes left,\n\n530\n00:26:57.495 --> 00:26:59.345\none goes right and-\n&gt;&gt; They're thinking of the same\n\n531\n00:26:59.345 --> 00:26:59.972\nthing at the same time.\n\n532\n00:26:59.972 --> 00:27:01.378\n&gt;&gt; They always meet\nback in the middle yes.\n\n533\n00:27:01.378 --> 00:27:03.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it's is kinda interesting right?\n\n534\n00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:04.070\nIt's a hive mind,\n\n535\n00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:06.470\nit's like a whole bunch of people\nthey all just think the same thing.\n\n536\n00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:08.899\nSo Diffie-Helmann is a very\nwell known algorithm.\n\n537\n00:27:08.899 --> 00:27:10.970\nVery well known asymmetric algorithm.\n\n538\n00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:12.810\nIt is used as you can see for\nkey exchange.\n\n539\n00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:14.660\nGive you a little bit of\nthe background there.\n\n540\n00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:19.131\nWhat Phil Diffie and Martin Hellmann two\ngentleman behind that in the late 1970s.\n\n541\n00:27:19.131 --> 00:27:22.550\nIt is used to this day, it is implemented\nin a variety of different ways,\n\n542\n00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:25.270\nvery, very popular,\nvery important algorithm.\n\n543\n00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:29.255\nWe have RSA, you can see here,\ndeveloped by the three mathematicians.\n\n544\n00:27:29.255 --> 00:27:31.285\nSo I named two of them\nin the last go around.\n\n545\n00:27:31.285 --> 00:27:32.625\nI couldn't remember the third one.\n\n546\n00:27:32.625 --> 00:27:37.535\nBut RSA stands for the last name of\neach of the three contributories.\n\n547\n00:27:37.535 --> 00:27:39.785\nRon Rivest, Adi Shamir,\nand Leonard Adleman.\n\n548\n00:27:39.785 --> 00:27:42.837\nI think I screwed up Adleman,\nI don't think I remembered him.\n\n549\n00:27:42.837 --> 00:27:44.175\nBut again, late 1970s.\n\n550\n00:27:44.175 --> 00:27:46.675\nThe late 1970s seemed to be\na great time for this stuff.\n\n551\n00:27:46.675 --> 00:27:49.564\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Deffie-Helmann in 1976, RSA 1977 They\n\n552\n00:27:49.564 --> 00:27:53.440\nmust have been something in the water\nback then or something, I don't know.\n\n553\n00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:54.550\nIt was disco back then, right?\n\n554\n00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:55.670\nIt was like the disco era?\n\n555\n00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:56.450\nMaybe it was disco.\n\n556\n00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:59.870\nMaybe disco was the whole reason\nthat just all this stuff happened.\n\n557\n00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:01.380\nAnd then they stopped disco and\n\n558\n00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:03.740\nthen no good algorithms\ncame out after that, right?\n\n559\n00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:05.935\nBut then they brought it back and\nthen we had more algorithms.\n\n560\n00:28:05.935 --> 00:28:09.570\nWe may have just uncovered\nthe hidden link here, right?\n\n561\n00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:13.289\nForget about black helicopters and\nspooky guys with glasses.\n\n562\n00:28:13.289 --> 00:28:16.917\n&gt;&gt; I think we actually have a disco\nball set up there in the back.\n\n563\n00:28:16.917 --> 00:28:18.710\n&gt;&gt; I think it's all related to disco.\n\n564\n00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:20.382\nI think that's what Area 51's all about,\n\n565\n00:28:20.382 --> 00:28:22.150\nit's about the disco\nencryption connection.\n\n566\n00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:24.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think that's what it is,\n\n567\n00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:25.370\ndisco encryption.\n\n568\n00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:26.402\nThat could be something.\n\n569\n00:28:26.402 --> 00:28:27.760\n&gt;&gt; I think you're on to something.\n\n570\n00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:28.693\n&gt;&gt; I think I may be.\n\n571\n00:28:28.693 --> 00:28:31.500\nThere's somebody waiting outside who wants\nto talk to us as soon as we're done.\n\n572\n00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:32.534\nThey look kind of scary so maybe.\n\n573\n00:28:32.534 --> 00:28:35.584\n&gt;&gt; You guys thought I got fire last week\nwhen I didn't come back so who knows,\n\n574\n00:28:35.584 --> 00:28:36.922\nmaybe that's going to happen.\n\n575\n00:28:36.922 --> 00:28:37.915\n[LAUGH].\n\n576\n00:28:37.915 --> 00:28:40.114\n&gt;&gt; You can never tell here at ITPro.TV.\n\n577\n00:28:40.114 --> 00:28:43.806\nAll right so just with RSA, what we wanna\nunderstand is two really critical things,\n\n578\n00:28:43.806 --> 00:28:46.666\nvery important things if you're\ngonna prepare for the exam, and\n\n579\n00:28:46.666 --> 00:28:48.020\nin general, just so you know.\n\n580\n00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:51.603\nOne of them talks about, something we\ntalk about with number theory in our last\n\n581\n00:28:51.603 --> 00:28:53.243\nepisode, grouping with numbers.\n\n582\n00:28:53.243 --> 00:28:55.506\nWhich is the idea that RSA is based or\n\n583\n00:28:55.506 --> 00:29:00.034\nthe difficulty of factoring large\nprime numbers and using the output,\n\n584\n00:29:00.034 --> 00:29:03.751\nthe resultant of those factors\nto then generate the keys.\n\n585\n00:29:03.751 --> 00:29:06.680\nWhen we say large,\nwe're talking like really large numbers.\n\n586\n00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:10.040\nWe're not talking, one, three,\nfive, seven, those primes.\n\n587\n00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.680\nWe're talking hundred places or more,\n\n588\n00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:15.980\nlike massive numbers being used,\nvery difficult to do.\n\n589\n00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:18.510\nThis is what RSA,\nthe algorithm is based around.\n\n590\n00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:22.646\nAlso the key sizes for RSA is variable,\nyou can see it's fairly strong.\n\n591\n00:29:22.646 --> 00:29:24.515\nVery, very strong most people would say.\n\n592\n00:29:24.515 --> 00:29:27.731\nFrom 1,024 to 4,096 bits.\n\n593\n00:29:27.731 --> 00:29:32.400\nYou have 4,096 the key is a really,\nreally big key, right?\n\n594\n00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.364\nIf you think about the key space for that,\n\n595\n00:29:34.364 --> 00:29:37.846\nhow big the number of possible\ncombinations would be We don't have enough\n\n596\n00:29:37.846 --> 00:29:40.786\nzero's at the end of that number\nto be able to represent that.\n\n597\n00:29:40.786 --> 00:29:42.600\nVery, very large key space.\n\n598\n00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.770\nSo that's what RSA is all about.\n\n599\n00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:45.403\nWe have-\n&gt;&gt; And Adam,\n\n600\n00:29:45.403 --> 00:29:49.304\nthat's gonna be like the basic,\nmost popular underlying protocol or\n\n601\n00:29:49.304 --> 00:29:52.120\nalgorithm being used\non the internet today?\n\n602\n00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:52.800\n&gt;&gt; Well it's one of them.\n\n603\n00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:53.416\nIt's not the only one.\n\n604\n00:29:53.416 --> 00:29:56.683\nCertainly Diffie-Hellman remember\nis used for key exchanges, so\n\n605\n00:29:56.683 --> 00:29:59.157\nit's used to negotiate key\nexchange all the time.\n\n606\n00:29:59.157 --> 00:30:01.050\nWe talked about ECC, which is up there.\n\n607\n00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:02.710\nYou mentioned in one\nof our other episodes.\n\n608\n00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:04.120\nThat's very popular.\n\n609\n00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:07.355\nIt's used to set on mobile devices\ntoday to drive encryption.\n\n610\n00:30:07.355 --> 00:30:12.095\nThere's a version of ECC called EC or\nECC Diffie-Hellman, which is used for\n\n611\n00:30:12.095 --> 00:30:12.935\nkey exchange.\n\n612\n00:30:12.935 --> 00:30:15.872\nSo there's a lot of different algorithms\ndepending on what we're talking about.\n\n613\n00:30:15.872 --> 00:30:18.085\nRSA is certainly very ubiquitous.\n\n614\n00:30:18.085 --> 00:30:19.285\nIt is deployed almost everywhere today.\n\n615\n00:30:19.285 --> 00:30:22.510\nIt's very popular whether\nit is the most popular,\n\n616\n00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:27.093\nis it the Carmen Electra of the algorithm\nworld in terms of the Internet?\n\n617\n00:30:27.093 --> 00:30:29.642\nI don't know for\nsure definitively if it would be.\n\n618\n00:30:29.642 --> 00:30:31.682\nI can tell you it is very popular.\n\n619\n00:30:31.682 --> 00:30:34.504\nBut as I said, if you look at just\nwhere these algorithms are deployed,\n\n620\n00:30:34.504 --> 00:30:35.312\nhow they're used.\n\n621\n00:30:35.312 --> 00:30:37.277\n&gt;&gt; The ad they want is mobile devices,\nyeah.\n\n622\n00:30:37.277 --> 00:30:42.333\n&gt;&gt; Things like that just ECC may be more\npopular just based on the fact that it's\n\n623\n00:30:42.333 --> 00:30:47.310\nimplemented pretty much in every mobile\ndevices on the planet in one form or\n\n624\n00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:48.430\nanother.\n\n625\n00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:52.900\nAnd you've got billions, literally just\nbillions of these devices floating around.\n\n626\n00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:57.070\nJust by sheer volume in numbers,\nit may actually not be as popular, RSA,\n\n627\n00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:59.760\njust because they may not be\ninstalled in every device and\n\n628\n00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:03.000\nused whereas ECC would be\nthe underlying architecture.\n\n629\n00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.048\nSo I don't know, for\nme I just I couldn't tell you,\n\n630\n00:31:05.048 --> 00:31:07.202\nI don't know I guess the short\nanswer is I don't know.\n\n631\n00:31:07.202 --> 00:31:08.149\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n632\n00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:10.050\nit would be an interesting one to look up.\n\n633\n00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:13.970\nI'm not sure if you could find information\nand stats on that, I don't know, but\n\n634\n00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:15.290\nit would be interesting to see.\n\n635\n00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:17.940\nIf I had to make a guess,\nI would say that ECC\n\n636\n00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:21.280\nmay be more widely deployed because\nof its use in mobile platforms.\n\n637\n00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:23.810\nBut that RSA may be used more\n\n638\n00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:27.750\non a daily basis just because of the fact\nof where it's used and how it's used.\n\n639\n00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:30.414\nSo there maybe kind of a neck\nto neck thing going on there.\n\n640\n00:31:30.414 --> 00:31:32.884\nMenezes-Qu-Vanstone, MQV.\n\n641\n00:31:32.884 --> 00:31:36.544\nThis is also used for key agreements and\nis based off Diffie-Hellman.\n\n642\n00:31:36.544 --> 00:31:38.590\nIt comes a little bit\nlater than Diffie-Hellman.\n\n643\n00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:44.397\nIt is in or is incorporated as\nthe public key standard IEEE P1363.\n\n644\n00:31:44.397 --> 00:31:46.551\nIEEE is the international group or\n\n645\n00:31:46.551 --> 00:31:50.497\nbody that maintains a lot of these\nstandards and puts them out.\n\n646\n00:31:50.497 --> 00:31:54.192\nThe Electrical Engineers Associations,\nglobally.\n\n647\n00:31:54.192 --> 00:31:57.379\nIt is a very interesting group, you\ncould go out and look at their website,\n\n648\n00:31:57.379 --> 00:31:57.970\nieee.org.\n\n649\n00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:01.150\nAnd if you look up IEEE standard P1363,\n\n650\n00:32:01.150 --> 00:32:05.650\nyou'll actually see the underlying\narchitectural information and\n\n651\n00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:07.930\nthe structure information about MQV and\nhow it works.\n\n652\n00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:09.900\nSo, you can go look\nthat up if you want to.\n\n653\n00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:14.380\nDSA, Digital Security Algorithm, or\nexcuse me, Digital Signature Algorithm.\n\n654\n00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:19.218\nNot digital security think about\nsomething else but DSA, digital signature\n\n655\n00:32:19.218 --> 00:32:24.206\nalgorithm has a U.S. patent associated\nwith it as many of these may or may not,\n\n656\n00:32:24.206 --> 00:32:28.599\nthis one is patent 5,231,668\nfiled in the early 1990s,\n\n657\n00:32:28.599 --> 00:32:33.527\n1991 there to be precise, Mr.\nKravitz, David Kravitz was behind this.\n\n658\n00:32:33.527 --> 00:32:38.299\nThe interesting one about this, the U.S.\ngovernment adopts this in 1993 and\n\n659\n00:32:38.299 --> 00:32:43.137\nmakes it Phipps 186, remember we talked\nabout Phipps 197, which is how we see\n\n660\n00:32:43.137 --> 00:32:47.592\nAES coming on board with the Richard Daw\nalgorithm being able to replace DES.\n\n661\n00:32:47.592 --> 00:32:51.502\nWe see Phipps 186 being\nused here to represent, and\n\n662\n00:32:51.502 --> 00:32:55.667\nto formally reach out and\nsay we wanna use this and make this\n\n663\n00:32:55.667 --> 00:33:01.850\nthe Federal Information Processing\nStandard for digital signature algorithm.\n\n664\n00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:05.360\nAt the time, this was how information\nwas digitally signed, or at least for\n\n665\n00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:08.590\nmany years how information has been\ndigitally signed by the US Government,\n\n666\n00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:09.720\nusing this particular standard.\n\n667\n00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:14.210\nSo, remember FIPS, Federal Information\nProcessing Standard is just the naming\n\n668\n00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:17.240\nconvention, the guideline for\nhow we see this in the federal register.\n\n669\n00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:18.730\nThat's where we go to look at up.\n\n670\n00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:22.317\nWe have ECC, we talked about this,\nelectric, electric,\n\n671\n00:33:22.317 --> 00:33:24.267\nElliptic Curve Cryptography.\n\n672\n00:33:24.267 --> 00:33:27.016\nDon't listen to me, just pay attention\nto what I say not everything I say,\n\n673\n00:33:27.016 --> 00:33:28.030\nonly the important stuff.\n\n674\n00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:31.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So ECC, Elliptic Curve Cryptography.\n\n675\n00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:33.880\nWe talked about this before,\nyou just heard me go through it again.\n\n676\n00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.200\nThere are different derivatives there.\n\n677\n00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:40.350\nYou'll see there's Elliptic Curve\nDiffie Hellman, Elliptic Curve DSA, and\n\n678\n00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:45.340\nthere's Elliptic Curve MQV, for\nagreement and key exchange protocols.\n\n679\n00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:46.280\nSo we see that.\n\n680\n00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:48.990\nCould we go just to full screen for\na minute so I can get ElGamal up there\n\n681\n00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:52.010\nbecause I can't bring that one up\nit's at the bottom of the document.\n\n682\n00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:54.069\nElGamal, also an interesting one.\n\n683\n00:33:54.069 --> 00:33:55.719\nThis is based again on Diffie Hellman,\n\n684\n00:33:55.719 --> 00:33:57.670\ncomes a little bit later\nthan Diffie Hellman.\n\n685\n00:33:57.670 --> 00:34:02.148\nYou'll see invented by Taher Elgamal,\n\n686\n00:34:02.148 --> 00:34:07.426\nhence the name for this gentleman in 1984.\n\n687\n00:34:07.426 --> 00:34:09.878\nIt is found in PGP as well as in GNU,\n\n688\n00:34:09.878 --> 00:34:13.270\nsometimes called gnu\nprivacy guard software.\n\n689\n00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:15.350\nSo it's very commonly used today.\n\n690\n00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:18.890\nThere are three parts to it, the key\ngenerator, the encryption algorithm, and,\n\n691\n00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:20.300\nof course, the decryption algorithm.\n\n692\n00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:24.370\nAnd ElGamal still has\nthe distinction of being famous for\n\n693\n00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:26.990\na lot of different reasons\nbased on Diffie Hellman, etc.\n\n694\n00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:29.350\nBut, it was made publicly available and\n\n695\n00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:34.410\nput into the public space if you will, and\na lot of people learned about it that way,\n\n696\n00:34:34.410 --> 00:34:37.860\nso it just has the distinction for\nthat and it's history, as well.\n\n697\n00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:41.422\nBut it is also one that we often see used\ntoday, especially if you're using, or\n\n698\n00:34:41.422 --> 00:34:44.204\nat least depending on the PGP\nimplementation you're using.\n\n699\n00:34:44.204 --> 00:34:46.875\nIf you're using certain forms of PGP,\nthey're based on ElGamal, so\n\n700\n00:34:46.875 --> 00:34:48.200\nit's kind of interesting there.\n\n701\n00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:50.918\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nIt's always cool whenever developers or\n\n702\n00:34:50.918 --> 00:34:55.662\nmathematicians create something and then\nput it out for use in the public domain,\n\n703\n00:34:55.662 --> 00:34:57.270\nI think it's pretty neat.\n\n704\n00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:59.210\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; They're gifts to the world.\n\n705\n00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:00.280\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n\n706\n00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:03.230\n&gt;&gt; All right, I think that's about it for\nthis particular episode,\n\n707\n00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:05.630\nso we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this show.\n\n708\n00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:10.540\nBut stay tuned,\nwe do have more asymmetric cryptography.\n\n709\n00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:11.460\nDo we have any more?\n\n710\n00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:12.120\nNope, that's it.\n\n711\n00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:16.868\nAll right, we do have more ECES headed\nyour way, so I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n712\n00:35:16.868 --> 00:35:19.416\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon, and\nwe actually will indirectly talk about\n\n713\n00:35:19.416 --> 00:35:22.552\nasymmetric cryptography again, so\nCherokee's not wrong about that, but\n\n714\n00:35:22.552 --> 00:35:25.590\nit will be in the guise, and in the\nthought process of a prior conversation\n\n715\n00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:27.330\nabout applying cryptography\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n716\n00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:28.030\n&gt;&gt; And cryptanalysis.\n\n717\n00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:30.650\nSo we'll be seeing that coming up\nin some of the future discussions.\n\n718\n00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:31.170\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great, thank you so much.\n\n719\n00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:32.239\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n720\n00:35:32.239 --> 00:35:34.493\n&gt;&gt; Bye\n\n721\n00:35:34.493 --> 00:35:40.547\n[MUSIC]\n\n722\n00:35:40.547 --> 00:35:46.270\nThank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.447\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.447 --> 00:00:11.986\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.986 --> 00:00:14.090\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your E\\CES series.\n\n6\n00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.160\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.890\nIn this episode,\nwe'll be examining different\n\n8\n00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.870\nforms of applications of cryptography,\nand we'll be looking at stick figures.\n\n9\n00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.210\nWith us today we have Mr.\nAdam Gordon in the studios.\n\n10\n00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.670\nThank you for joining us, Adam.\n\n11\n00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.260\n&gt;&gt; Forms of applications of\ncryptography and stick figures.\n\n12\n00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; My God, that is so\n\n13\n00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.180\nawesome I can't even control myself.\n\n14\n00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.155\nLook at how excited I am.\n\n15\n00:00:35.155 --> 00:00:38.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can't control myself, very exciting.\n\n16\n00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.160\nHope I didn't scare any of you out there.\n\n17\n00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.570\nIf you have your own children or\npets, lock them away now.\n\n18\n00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.196\nAll right, so we're gonna continue\ntalking, as Cherokee was saying, about,\n\n19\n00:00:45.196 --> 00:00:46.250\nactually, really cool stuff.\n\n20\n00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.000\nWe do joke around quite a bit, but\n\n21\n00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.908\nwe are going to talk about\nsome interesting stuff.\n\n22\n00:00:49.908 --> 00:00:52.410\nBecause we're gonna actually\nget out of the hey,\n\n23\n00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.460\nlet's talk about the theory\nportion of our conversations.\n\n24\n00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.930\nAnd we've been doing quite a bit of that,\n\n25\n00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.970\nand hopefully it's been very valuable for\nyou.\n\n26\n00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.790\nI know it's been exciting and fun for us.\n\n27\n00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.770\nIt's always good to talk through\nthat stuff, understand the logic,\n\n28\n00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:04.640\nthe thought process.\n\n29\n00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.160\nThe who, what, when, where, why, and\nhow, if you will of how things operate.\n\n30\n00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.210\nBut we're gonna take a break from that for\na little bit.\n\n31\n00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.460\nI think we've done a pretty good job\nof laying all that down for you.\n\n32\n00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.160\nI encourage you to go back, take a look\nat some of that if you need a refresher.\n\n33\n00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.510\nOr really just brush up on\nsome of those mechanics, and\n\n34\n00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.840\nsome of the things\nassociated with those items.\n\n35\n00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.250\nBut we're gonna take a look at a more\npractical vision of cryptography now,\n\n36\n00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.295\nstick figures will help us to do that.\n\n37\n00:01:29.295 --> 00:01:30.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Never quite thought of that that\n\n38\n00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.600\nway before, but that is true.\n\n39\n00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.230\nBut what we are gonna do is look\nunder the hood a little bit\n\n40\n00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.320\nabout how we actually take\nthe theory of cryptography.\n\n41\n00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.880\nAnd how we start to apply\nit to the real world.\n\n42\n00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.660\nYou know, we've been joking around and\ntalking about keys, and certificates, and\n\n43\n00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.710\nPKI, and asymmetric, and symmetric.\n\n44\n00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.650\nAnd we've been talking about blocks and\nciphers.\n\n45\n00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.370\nHad a great, I keep doing that, blocks and\nciphers, block ciphers and string ciphers.\n\n46\n00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.460\nHad a great episode, if you haven't seen\nit I'd encourage you to go back take\n\n47\n00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.030\na look on how block ciphers work.\n\n48\n00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.310\nWent through and\ndiscussed all that at length,\n\n49\n00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.490\nwe spent a lot of time\ndeveloping those ideas with you.\n\n50\n00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.670\nBut what we haven't really done as much of\nis talk about how we actually go out and\n\n51\n00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:11.730\napply this stuff.\n\n52\n00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.480\nAnd when we're certified\nencryption specialists,\n\n53\n00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.240\nwe're not certified only in theory.\n\n54\n00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.390\nBut we're certified in the practicality\nand the hands on application of this.\n\n55\n00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.170\nSo this is an important subpart,\na subcomponent of the whole conversation\n\n56\n00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.270\nthat we're gonna be engaging in throughout\nall of our episodes for this entire show.\n\n57\n00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.110\nAnd so we wanna jump in and\nhave you help us,\n\n58\n00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.260\nand have us help you to better understand.\n\n59\n00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.720\nThe every day practically\nin some of the cryptography\n\n60\n00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.080\nthought processes we've been engaging in.\n\n61\n00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.010\nSo to that end,\n\n62\n00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.370\nlet's just remind ourselves first\nof where we are coming from.\n\n63\n00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.370\nWe've talked about asymmetric\ncryptography, public, private key pair.\n\n64\n00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.488\nWe've talked about the value of\nthe public key, the private key.\n\n65\n00:02:48.488 --> 00:02:51.752\nHow those two are mathematically\njoined related to one another.\n\n66\n00:02:51.752 --> 00:02:54.906\nBut, yet also, kept separate from\none another for most part except,\n\n67\n00:02:54.906 --> 00:02:57.580\ninitially, when they\nare going to be generated.\n\n68\n00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.202\nAnd when we do that, we are able to\ntake that private key as Kirchhoff's\n\n69\n00:03:02.202 --> 00:03:04.524\nprinciple says and keep it secret.\n\n70\n00:03:04.524 --> 00:03:08.459\nAnd we store that, and we keep that\nisolated away from prying eyes,\n\n71\n00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.925\nwe take our public public key,\nand we make that available.\n\n72\n00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:14.675\nWe talked about public key\nservers that can be available for\n\n73\n00:03:14.675 --> 00:03:16.766\ndownloading the public key for validation.\n\n74\n00:03:16.766 --> 00:03:18.874\nAnd we store that in the form\nof a certificate and\n\n75\n00:03:18.874 --> 00:03:22.265\nwe usually make that available through\na digital certificate of some kind.\n\n76\n00:03:22.265 --> 00:03:24.481\nWe're gonna take a look at\nthe practicality of that and\n\n77\n00:03:24.481 --> 00:03:26.031\nhow that works in a couple of minutes.\n\n78\n00:03:26.031 --> 00:03:31.130\nAnd we've talked about digitally signing,\nbe able to go through and validate\n\n79\n00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.320\nthe authenticity, the proof of origin,\nthe non repudiation, of a document.\n\n80\n00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.305\nPerhaps an email, perhaps signatures,\n\n81\n00:03:38.305 --> 00:03:41.550\ndigital signatures applied to\nsoftware to validate the software.\n\n82\n00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.330\nThat the company that's issuing\nit is doing so legitimately,\n\n83\n00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.470\nthat it's not being spoofed in any way.\n\n84\n00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.400\nSo Microsoft, Google,\nAmazon, Citrix, Cisco,\n\n85\n00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.760\ndon't wanna leave out any of those big\ntechnology companies, all of them, Oracle.\n\n86\n00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.730\nAny of these companies\nthat generate software,\n\n87\n00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.340\nall of them are digitally\nsigning their software.\n\n88\n00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.959\nAnd we're gonna, obviously, be able to\nsee evidence of that as we look at and\n\n89\n00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.754\nlook under the hood on those systems.\n\n90\n00:04:04.754 --> 00:04:08.490\nAnd see whether those digital certificates\nare indeed legitimate or not.\n\n91\n00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.210\nAnd the prove the efficacy,\nthe validity, of that software to ensure\n\n92\n00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.460\nit's not being modified, spoofed or\nmasqueraded in some way.\n\n93\n00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.660\nMaybe it leads to a malware infestation,\n\n94\n00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.220\nmaybe we download software\nthinking it's legitimate.\n\n95\n00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.822\nWe don't check the signature and\nas a result we get what we think is real\n\n96\n00:04:23.822 --> 00:04:27.072\nsoftware, but find out we got malware or\nsomething like that.\n\n97\n00:04:27.072 --> 00:04:28.391\n&gt;&gt; Extra presents.\n\n98\n00:04:28.391 --> 00:04:30.635\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Trojans, or things of that nature,\n\n99\n00:04:30.635 --> 00:04:32.308\nright, will come in those gift baskets.\n\n100\n00:04:32.308 --> 00:04:34.794\nSo we have to be careful about\nwhere those things come from and\n\n101\n00:04:34.794 --> 00:04:36.120\nwhere we are getting them from.\n\n102\n00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.346\nRemember, stranger danger,\nright, don't talk to strangers.\n\n103\n00:04:38.346 --> 00:04:39.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Mom and\n\n104\n00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:40.920\ndad were always correct about that.\n\n105\n00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.780\nRun the other way quickly when somebody\noffers you a strange basket of\n\n106\n00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:44.670\nbits, right?\n\n107\n00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:45.980\nThat's never a good thing.\n\n108\n00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.560\nSo we wanna think about the fact that\ndigital signature is very important as we\n\n109\n00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.260\nconsider this.\n\n110\n00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.235\nAnd digital signature and how we do that.\n\n111\n00:04:52.235 --> 00:04:56.090\nWent through that in great detail of\nwhose key we're using to what end,\n\n112\n00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.876\nhow we are doing that.\n\n113\n00:04:56.876 --> 00:04:59.628\nRemember we digitally signed\nusing our private key.\n\n114\n00:04:59.628 --> 00:05:03.035\nCuz we're not applying\na confidentiality protection.\n\n115\n00:05:03.035 --> 00:05:06.400\nWe're not keeping good data away\nfrom bad people by hiding it\n\n116\n00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.530\nwith digital centuries.\n\n117\n00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.145\nBut rather we are applying\nan integrity control.\n\n118\n00:05:10.145 --> 00:05:13.460\nWe're trying to ensure that\nthe data has not been modified or\n\n119\n00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.840\nin any way changed without knowledge or\nconsent of the owner.\n\n120\n00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.170\nAnd we're proving our identity and\nproving our intent by digitally signing.\n\n121\n00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.230\nAnd so as a result,\nwe use our private key.\n\n122\n00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.453\nBecause we're not exposing the key,\nwe're hashing the key and\n\n123\n00:05:27.453 --> 00:05:30.329\ncryptographically representing\nthe key with the data.\n\n124\n00:05:30.329 --> 00:05:34.034\nIn a form that allows somebody to\nvalidate the key, with our public key,\n\n125\n00:05:34.034 --> 00:05:35.860\nthe corresponding key pair.\n\n126\n00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.574\nThey download the key, or somehow acquire\nthe public key, run another hash,\n\n127\n00:05:39.574 --> 00:05:41.614\nessentially, to compare the signature.\n\n128\n00:05:41.614 --> 00:05:44.064\nAnd by doing that they can\nvalidate whether we sent it.\n\n129\n00:05:44.064 --> 00:05:47.804\nAnd, as a result, also validate whether\nthe data has been modified along the way\n\n130\n00:05:47.804 --> 00:05:49.950\nthrough transmission or\nanywhere that we go.\n\n131\n00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.710\nSo digital signatures\nare also very important\n\n132\n00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.250\non what we've been talking about.\n\n133\n00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.680\nBut the really underlying fundamental\ncarrier vessel, the thing\n\n134\n00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.650\nthat makes digital signatures possible\nis the idea of a digital certificate.\n\n135\n00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.791\nAnd we haven't shown you one yet,\nI know we've talked about it.\n\n136\n00:06:04.791 --> 00:06:07.700\nWe've hinted at it, if you will,\nwe're gonna have the big reveal.\n\n137\n00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.169\nNow we're gonna see if we\ncan time this exactly right.\n\n138\n00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:11.942\nSo I wanna make sure everyone\nis paying attention,\n\n139\n00:06:11.942 --> 00:06:13.550\nwe wanna make sure we get this right.\n\n140\n00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.098\nI wanna make sure that when I point,\nand I'm not doing it,\n\n141\n00:06:16.098 --> 00:06:18.299\nthis is a test by the way,-\n&gt;&gt; Is your finger charged?\n\n142\n00:06:18.299 --> 00:06:19.100\n&gt;&gt; What?\n&gt;&gt; Is your finger charged?\n\n143\n00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.520\n&gt;&gt; My finger is fully charged,\nat least during lunch I did.\n\n144\n00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.700\nSo, this is not the actual point check,\nthis is the demo point, this is the test.\n\n145\n00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.830\nBut when I do this for real,\nnot yet, but when I do it for real.\n\n146\n00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:29.560\nWhen I do that for\n\n147\n00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.510\nreal, what we're gonna bring up on\nthe screen is gonna be a certificate\n\n148\n00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:37.970\nmanagement console that's gonna then let\nus see local certificates on my machine.\n\n149\n00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.778\nSo the big reveal,\nwe need like a drum roll.\n\n150\n00:06:39.778 --> 00:06:42.346\nDaniel actually gave me a drum\nroll in what we were doing.\n\n151\n00:06:42.346 --> 00:06:44.440\nThat's exactly what we need,\nbut we need it when I'm ready.\n\n152\n00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.140\nBut we actually do this, cuz I was doing\na a key drop, I said, when I'm done and\n\n153\n00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.000\nI drop the key, but\nwe had no sound effect.\n\n154\n00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.350\nSo I actually said,\nyou know what you need to.\n\n155\n00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.510\n&gt;&gt; But that's not fair,\nI think Daniel was in a band, so.\n\n156\n00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:54.010\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n157\n00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:55.212\n&gt;&gt; But what he did was like,\n\n158\n00:06:55.212 --> 00:06:57.957\nhe did the whole thing, and\nso I dropped it, we did like,\n\n159\n00:06:57.957 --> 00:07:00.295\nwe had live sound effects.\nSo it was really cool, so\n\n160\n00:07:00.295 --> 00:07:01.225\nyou need to-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n161\n00:07:01.225 --> 00:07:02.825\n&gt;&gt; Outperform him, okay.\n\n162\n00:07:02.825 --> 00:07:04.677\n&gt;&gt; I don't know any sound effects.\n\n163\n00:07:04.677 --> 00:07:06.729\n&gt;&gt; We need something, come on, get ready-\n&gt;&gt; All right, I'm ready.\n\n164\n00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:08.913\n&gt;&gt; This is good, all right, so,\nhere we're gonna go, big reveal,\n\n165\n00:07:08.913 --> 00:07:10.018\nwe're gonna show you-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n166\n00:07:10.018 --> 00:07:11.340\n&gt;&gt; What a certificate looks like, okay.\n\n167\n00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.654\nSo we're ready, are we ready?\n\n168\n00:07:12.654 --> 00:07:13.952\n&gt;&gt; We're ready.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, awesome, so,\n\n169\n00:07:13.952 --> 00:07:14.838\non the count of three.\n\n170\n00:07:14.838 --> 00:07:17.564\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; All right, five, two, two and a half,\n\n171\n00:07:17.564 --> 00:07:19.320\nseven and three-quarters.\n\n172\n00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:19.830\nAre you ready?\n\n173\n00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:20.953\nI'm only kidding, all right.\n\n174\n00:07:20.953 --> 00:07:24.789\nOn the count of three, one, two, three.\n\n175\n00:07:24.789 --> 00:07:26.428\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; Wow,\n\n176\n00:07:26.428 --> 00:07:28.660\nthat was like an intense drum roll.\n\n177\n00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.172\nAll right, so\nhere we have our certificate [INAUDIBLE].\n\n178\n00:07:31.172 --> 00:07:33.140\nThat was awesome by the way,\ngood job, thank you so much.\n\n179\n00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right.\n&gt;&gt; It's a pleasure\n\n180\n00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:38.000\nworking with professionals that understand\nthe value of important sound effects.\n\n181\n00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.460\nSo we have our certificate MMC.\n\n182\n00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.936\nNow we've talked about\ncertificates before.\n\n183\n00:07:41.936 --> 00:07:44.700\nI did mention in one of the prior\nepisodes, hey we have them.\n\n184\n00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.760\nYou could go in any web browser,\nyou could find them.\n\n185\n00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.011\nYou and\nI talked about the fact that in Chrome,\n\n186\n00:07:49.011 --> 00:07:52.312\nyou know its a major undertaking\nthe drill through, and find them.\n\n187\n00:07:52.312 --> 00:07:56.212\nSo we just went in and installed or\nadded into a generic MMC,\n\n188\n00:07:56.212 --> 00:07:59.647\na Microsoft Management Console,\nin Windows 10.\n\n189\n00:07:59.647 --> 00:08:01.496\nI'm on a Windows 10 machine here demoing.\n\n190\n00:08:01.496 --> 00:08:06.779\nI just went in, run line MMC,\nenter blank MMC shell, went to file,\n\n191\n00:08:06.779 --> 00:08:12.040\nadd/remove for the components,\nchose a certificate console.\n\n192\n00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.620\nThe console for the certificates,\nas you can see.\n\n193\n00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.260\nInstalled that, brought it up.\n\n194\n00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.480\nAnd all we're doing is looking at some of\nthe different certificates in the machine.\n\n195\n00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.170\nSo, just wanted to show\nyou what one looks like.\n\n196\n00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.080\nDoesn't really matter\nwhere we get them from.\n\n197\n00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:27.753\nThe idea is, that all these certificates,\nmost of them anyway, not all of them,\n\n198\n00:08:27.753 --> 00:08:30.284\nsome of them are not gonna be x.509V3.\n\n199\n00:08:30.284 --> 00:08:35.529\nBut almost without exception\nall of them are x.509V3, as in,\n\n200\n00:08:35.529 --> 00:08:41.760\nthe certificate template standard\nx509 version three for the template.\n\n201\n00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.790\nThat is the standardized way and\nthe standardized mechanism and\n\n202\n00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.190\ntemplate we use to create\ncertificates today.\n\n203\n00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:51.730\nIt is the most commonly deployed\ncertificate template in the world.\n\n204\n00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:55.302\nWe've been using it since 199\nthe 1988 actually, believe it or not.\n\n205\n00:08:55.302 --> 00:08:57.839\nSo it's been around for a long time.\n\n206\n00:08:57.839 --> 00:09:01.790\nThe X509 standard and\nthis is how we represent certificates.\n\n207\n00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:04.765\nI thought I would show you a couple of\ncertificates, to show you what they are.\n\n208\n00:09:04.765 --> 00:09:08.947\nAnd then by way of doing that talk about\nsome of the fields that are common in\n\n209\n00:09:08.947 --> 00:09:13.873\ncertificates, wanna know what those are,\nthings like issuer name, serial number,\n\n210\n00:09:13.873 --> 00:09:17.126\nversion, signature algorithm,\nthe validity period.\n\n211\n00:09:17.126 --> 00:09:21.583\nWe talked about that before, how some are\nlike you shoot for a year traditionally,\n\n212\n00:09:21.583 --> 00:09:26.580\nothers it's ridiculous like 40 year, life\nspan they give it for root certificates.\n\n213\n00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:29.030\nAll that kind of stuff, so\nI'm gonna show you all that and\n\n214\n00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:31.601\nthen when we're done making\nsure we know what's in there.\n\n215\n00:09:31.601 --> 00:09:32.740\nWe're gonna go ahead.\n\n216\n00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:36.366\nCherokee worked really hard on\ngetting some graphics together for\n\n217\n00:09:36.366 --> 00:09:39.418\nus about PKI and\nwe're gonna take a look at some of that.\n\n218\n00:09:39.418 --> 00:09:43.060\nAnd round out our conversation taking\na look at these stick figures of lore and\n\n219\n00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.540\nmyth that you heard about\nin the opening of our show.\n\n220\n00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:46.620\nDon't want to forget about them.\n\n221\n00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.660\nSo let's start by talking about and\ntaking a look at some certificates.\n\n222\n00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:52.210\nNow, what I've done, I know it's a little\nbit hard to see because it is off to\n\n223\n00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:55.050\nthe side here,\nwe have different kinds of certificates.\n\n224\n00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:58.656\nI have trusted root certificate\nauthorities opened up as a folder here,\n\n225\n00:09:58.656 --> 00:10:01.741\nand I have intermediate\ncertificate authorities opened up.\n\n226\n00:10:01.741 --> 00:10:05.161\nAnd we're gonna take a look at\ncertificates from each one because I want\n\n227\n00:10:05.161 --> 00:10:08.239\nto show you the trust path, right,\nI want to demonstrate that or\n\n228\n00:10:08.239 --> 00:10:09.439\nshow that to you as well.\n\n229\n00:10:09.439 --> 00:10:14.060\nAnd so we're gonna start at the top of\nthe hierarchy with our trusted root CAs.\n\n230\n00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.621\nAnd when we go back and\ntake a look at the diagrams and\n\n231\n00:10:16.621 --> 00:10:20.390\nthe pki public key infrastructure\narchitecture in a couple minutes.\n\n232\n00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:23.705\nWe're gonna remind ourselves of this\ncuz we haven't really talked about pki,\n\n233\n00:10:23.705 --> 00:10:26.936\nwe actually spoke about it and talked\nabout route certificate authorities.\n\n234\n00:10:26.936 --> 00:10:28.755\nAnd talked about subordinate CAs or\n\n235\n00:10:28.755 --> 00:10:31.368\nin intermediate CAs\nare referred to differently.\n\n236\n00:10:31.368 --> 00:10:35.599\nSo we're gonna take a look at these but\nlet's start up at the root here.\n\n237\n00:10:35.599 --> 00:10:38.910\nLet's go to certificates, we have\nquite a number of them as you can see.\n\n238\n00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:41.980\nAnd we can randomly choose whichever\none it doesn't really matter.\n\n239\n00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:45.301\nYou have a favorite or\na preference there Cherokee?\n\n240\n00:10:45.301 --> 00:10:46.273\n&gt;&gt; DigiCert.\n\n241\n00:10:46.273 --> 00:10:48.128\n&gt;&gt; DigiCert okay let's do DigiCert.\n\n242\n00:10:48.128 --> 00:10:50.743\nSo let's do the DigiCert global root CA.\n\n243\n00:10:50.743 --> 00:10:53.073\nWe have a couple there it may be\nhard to see which one is which so\n\n244\n00:10:53.073 --> 00:10:56.201\nbecause I don't want you to walk up to the\nscreen and have to do this so you can see.\n\n245\n00:10:56.201 --> 00:10:58.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let's take a [CROSSTALK].\n\n246\n00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.578\n&gt;&gt; Peel my eyeballs open, yeah.\n\n247\n00:11:00.578 --> 00:11:03.899\n&gt;&gt; She's trying to like, yeah,\nI think I can see something with a d.\n\n248\n00:11:03.899 --> 00:11:04.629\n&gt;&gt; Something trust.\n\n249\n00:11:04.629 --> 00:11:06.576\nAlmost all of them have\nthe word trust in it.\n\n250\n00:11:06.576 --> 00:11:07.774\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Let me go with that.\nI'm going guess and\n\n251\n00:11:07.774 --> 00:11:09.604\nsay there's probably a sign in there.\n\n252\n00:11:09.604 --> 00:11:10.400\nWhy don't we try that one.\n\n253\n00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.725\nAll right so let's do Digicert.\n\n254\n00:11:11.725 --> 00:11:12.730\nWe'll do the roots CA.\n\n255\n00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:15.465\nSo we're just going to bring this up and\nI'm going to bring this over here and\n\n256\n00:11:15.465 --> 00:11:17.371\nkind of center it so\nwe can see it a little bit better.\n\n257\n00:11:17.371 --> 00:11:19.700\nNow what we have on the certificate,\non the general tab.\n\n258\n00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.800\nThis is going to follow the case for\nall certificates typically.\n\n259\n00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.010\nWe'll see a certificate\ninformation statement.\n\n260\n00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:29.740\nThis is the issue or statement that\ntells us what the purpose, in this case,\n\n261\n00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:33.130\npurposes, cuz there's more than one,\nthat the certificate is designed for.\n\n262\n00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:35.603\nSo what do we essentially issue it to do?\n\n263\n00:11:35.603 --> 00:11:39.279\nDo we issue it to digitally sign,\nto do encryption,\n\n264\n00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:44.711\nto do identity validation, to allow us\nto be able to protect email messages,\n\n265\n00:11:44.711 --> 00:11:48.920\nas I said, through digitally signing or\nencrypting?\n\n266\n00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.150\nAll these different things.\n\n267\n00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:53.831\nSo this one has an about six or\nseven different items on it.\n\n268\n00:11:53.831 --> 00:11:57.912\nAll issuance policies,\nensure identity of remote computer,\n\n269\n00:11:57.912 --> 00:12:00.960\nensure your identity to a remote computer.\n\n270\n00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:05.192\nSo validate who you are locally, validate\nwho you are remotely to somebody who you\n\n271\n00:12:05.192 --> 00:12:07.171\nare engaging in a conversation with.\n\n272\n00:12:07.171 --> 00:12:10.387\nProtecting so\nprobably in encrypt messages,\n\n273\n00:12:10.387 --> 00:12:13.370\nensure software came\nfrom software publisher.\n\n274\n00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:15.930\nThat's the digital signature we\ntalked about to validate software.\n\n275\n00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:19.880\nSo a lot of different reasons why\nthe certificate is issued and can be used.\n\n276\n00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.860\nWe have the issue two issue\nby valid from lines, so\n\n277\n00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:26.140\nwho is this certificate issued to,\nwho is it issued by?\n\n278\n00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.810\nIn this case it's a root CA,\n\n279\n00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:30.860\nit's a self-signed certificate\ncoming from the root CA.\n\n280\n00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:33.990\nSo issue two and\nissue by will be the same entity.\n\n281\n00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:36.559\nBut when we go down into\nan intermediate CA.\n\n282\n00:12:36.559 --> 00:12:38.580\nSo we'll go down in a minute,\nlook at a subordinate.\n\n283\n00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:43.530\nAnd we look at that, we'll see that issued\nto and issued by, are gonna differ.\n\n284\n00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:46.651\nThe issued to will be the entity\nthat holds the certificate.\n\n285\n00:12:46.651 --> 00:12:50.250\nThe issued by will be the root CA that we\nget it from hierarchically one level up in\n\n286\n00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:52.420\nthe chain, multiple levels up.\n\n287\n00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:56.680\nAnd the trust chain, and the validity\nperiod in this case, it's one of\n\n288\n00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:01.800\nthose crazy ones from 2006 to 2031, so\nit's got a 25 year life span for that.\n\n289\n00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.638\nNow, that's not uncommon by the way for\nroot CAs,\n\n290\n00:13:04.638 --> 00:13:09.136\nroot CA self signed certificates tend to\nbe issued for a very long period of time.\n\n291\n00:13:09.136 --> 00:13:12.263\nAnd we've talked about the reasons\nwhy in the prior episodes,\n\n292\n00:13:12.263 --> 00:13:14.800\nwhen we talked about this,\nwhere we stipulate it,\n\n293\n00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.950\nwe talk about the fact that we\nkeep these root CAs offline.\n\n294\n00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:20.470\nThe issuing CAs that give\nout these certificates.\n\n295\n00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:24.650\nAnd we don't allow them to interact\nwith users or computers directly and\n\n296\n00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:27.810\nthe reason is we don't want those\ncertificates become invalidated\n\n297\n00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:31.830\nbecause somebody can spoof or\nsomehow generate one erroneously.\n\n298\n00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:35.224\nAnd so these have a very long shelf\nlife because we don't tend to issue them\n\n299\n00:13:35.224 --> 00:13:35.841\nvery often.\n\n300\n00:13:35.841 --> 00:13:39.170\nWe wanna get them out the door and\nthen turn off that root CA.\n\n301\n00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:43.140\nStore it securely and then really not use\nit again unless absolutely necessary.\n\n302\n00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.460\nSo it's not unusual to\nsee long lifetimes or\n\n303\n00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.370\nlong validity periods here for\nroot CA certificates.\n\n304\n00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:49.460\nJust so we know.\n\n305\n00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:53.338\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so Adam, you're talking about,\ncontextually speaking, the role or\n\n306\n00:13:53.338 --> 00:13:55.528\nthe function of a particular certificate.\n\n307\n00:13:55.528 --> 00:13:59.026\nAnd like you said, some of them, if they\ndo expire, I don't know about you but\n\n308\n00:13:59.026 --> 00:14:02.210\nI've been on, browsing the web, and\nit gives a little notification.\n\n309\n00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:05.905\nIt won't prohibit you, per se,\nfrom navigating to that web page but\n\n310\n00:14:05.905 --> 00:14:09.209\nyou may receive notifications saying-\n&gt;&gt; Certificates expired or\n\n311\n00:14:09.209 --> 00:14:11.252\nperhaps non-valid or it can't be trusted.\n\n312\n00:14:11.252 --> 00:14:12.122\nYou see different ones.\n\n313\n00:14:12.122 --> 00:14:13.009\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n314\n00:14:13.009 --> 00:14:15.376\nit doesn't necessarily mean\nthis is a bad website but\n\n315\n00:14:15.376 --> 00:14:18.072\nit may just be that they didn't\npay the bill or whatever but.\n\n316\n00:14:18.072 --> 00:14:19.610\n&gt;&gt; Well, it could mean a lot of things.\n\n317\n00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:21.882\nSo it could mean certainly,\nright, they didn't,\n\n318\n00:14:21.882 --> 00:14:24.931\nperhaps if they're getting\na certificate from a actual commercial,\n\n319\n00:14:24.931 --> 00:14:27.062\nwe call it a commercial CA\nwhere they have to pay.\n\n320\n00:14:27.062 --> 00:14:27.570\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n321\n00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:29.150\n&gt;&gt; Then they may have\nnot paid their bills, so\n\n322\n00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:31.510\nthe certificate may have been revoked or\nmay not have been renewed.\n\n323\n00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:32.560\nThat is one option.\n\n324\n00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:36.347\nIf it's a self-signed\ncertificate from an internal CA,\n\n325\n00:14:36.347 --> 00:14:42.390\nthink Microsoft Windows Domain Controllers\nwith Certificate Services installed, ADCS.\n\n326\n00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:45.990\nOr the equivalent in a Linux Unix\nsolution, where you have your own CA,\n\n327\n00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:50.070\nyour own certificate authority, and\nyou're issuing your own certificates for\n\n328\n00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:51.340\nuse internally.\n\n329\n00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:54.280\nYou could have that certificate expire\njust because you forgot to renew\n\n330\n00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.800\nit in the validity period, ran out.\n\n331\n00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.780\nThat happen to customers all the time.\n\n332\n00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:59.490\nConstantly getting phone calls.\n\n333\n00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:00.950\nHey, our certificates have ran out.\n\n334\n00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:01.809\nThey expired.\n\n335\n00:15:01.809 --> 00:15:02.970\nNothing works.\n\n336\n00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:05.508\n&gt;&gt; Yes [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; And as a result, what do we do?\n\n337\n00:15:05.508 --> 00:15:10.020\nNow you know there's different issues here\nbecause if you're using a certificate for\n\n338\n00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:11.935\ninstance to validate a website, and\n\n339\n00:15:11.935 --> 00:15:14.734\nattach that let's say\nhypothetically to a website.\n\n340\n00:15:14.734 --> 00:15:17.577\nAnd that certificate expires and\nis no longer valid,\n\n341\n00:15:17.577 --> 00:15:19.925\nthat website cannot be authenticated.\n\n342\n00:15:19.925 --> 00:15:22.005\nYou can't log in and access the website.\n\n343\n00:15:22.005 --> 00:15:25.195\nSo it could be actually that\nthings do stop working.\n\n344\n00:15:25.195 --> 00:15:27.895\nIt may not just be I can keep browsing.\n\n345\n00:15:27.895 --> 00:15:29.364\nIt may be guess what,\n\n346\n00:15:29.364 --> 00:15:33.477\nthere's nothing there even though\nit is cuz until you reissue, or\n\n347\n00:15:33.477 --> 00:15:38.408\nyou modify the website's security\nparameters to not use certificates right?\n\n348\n00:15:38.408 --> 00:15:39.028\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n349\n00:15:39.028 --> 00:15:41.812\n&gt;&gt; You could drop down that\nauthentication requirement and\n\n350\n00:15:41.812 --> 00:15:44.360\nmake it something\ndifferent than what it is.\n\n351\n00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.089\nBut if you're using certificates for\nauthentication and validation, and\n\n352\n00:15:47.089 --> 00:15:50.124\nthat certificate expires, that website's\nnot coming up until you fix that.\n\n353\n00:15:50.124 --> 00:15:51.567\n&gt;&gt; You don't have to tell me that.\n\n354\n00:15:51.567 --> 00:15:55.520\nLast week with Remote Desktop Services,\nnot having those certificates correct,\n\n355\n00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.107\nit's not gonna work correctly.\n\n356\n00:15:57.107 --> 00:15:57.790\n&gt;&gt; It will not.\n\n357\n00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:58.856\nYou won't be able to validate.\n\n358\n00:15:58.856 --> 00:15:59.624\nYou won't be able to authenticate.\n\n359\n00:15:59.624 --> 00:16:00.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n360\n00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.992\n&gt;&gt; Now, as I said, we can get around\nthat as The owner of that site,\n\n361\n00:16:03.992 --> 00:16:08.421\nis the owner of the rdp environment,\nwe could drop down the requirement for\n\n362\n00:16:08.421 --> 00:16:10.768\nauthentication using certificates.\n\n363\n00:16:10.768 --> 00:16:14.690\nBut remember we're essentially\nlowering our protection profile and\n\n364\n00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:18.212\nmaybe inviting bad actors in\nthe front door if they realize that\n\n365\n00:16:18.212 --> 00:16:20.485\nwe're not as protected as we should be.\n\n366\n00:16:20.485 --> 00:16:24.172\nSo, we never wanna recommended\nthat as an actual compensating\n\n367\n00:16:24.172 --> 00:16:27.312\ncontrol mechanism that says,\nI forgot to do that.\n\n368\n00:16:27.312 --> 00:16:31.321\nLet me, essentially, dumb down my\nsecurity to lowest common denominator,\n\n369\n00:16:31.321 --> 00:16:32.129\nuntil I fix it.\n\n370\n00:16:32.129 --> 00:16:33.029\n&gt;&gt; Make it work.\n\n371\n00:16:33.029 --> 00:16:34.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's not a good idea.\n\n372\n00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:38.360\nWe'd rather see you go out and fix the\nproblem, pay the bill, renew certificate,\n\n373\n00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:42.480\nwhatever it is, and keep the protection\nsecure at the highest level.\n\n374\n00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.100\nBut there are many reasons\nwhy these may not happen.\n\n375\n00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.330\nYou also may see in the real world,\n\n376\n00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:50.875\nyou've probably seen this a lot as\nwell where you will get that annoying\n\n377\n00:16:50.875 --> 00:16:54.640\npop-up on a website before you get through\nwhere it has the certificate warning page.\n\n378\n00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:58.810\nIt says, site not trusted, as you were\nsaying, or site not authenticated, or\n\n379\n00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:00.260\nyou see different messages.\n\n380\n00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.442\nBut it comes up with the red shield\ngreen thing and you're kind of like,\n\n381\n00:17:03.442 --> 00:17:04.461\nwhich one do I choose?\n\n382\n00:17:04.461 --> 00:17:07.257\nAnd red is always bad, but you've got\nto click on the red one to continue.\n\n383\n00:17:07.257 --> 00:17:08.421\nAnd it's very confusing.\n\n384\n00:17:08.421 --> 00:17:09.858\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so you get that,\n\n385\n00:17:09.858 --> 00:17:12.761\nespecially you get that\ninternally in many environments.\n\n386\n00:17:12.761 --> 00:17:16.310\nI deal with my Microsoft-centric\ncustomers on this all the time.\n\n387\n00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:19.750\nWe get this with Systems Center, with\ncertificate enrollment for end points,\n\n388\n00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:24.080\nwith SCCM, System Center Configuration\nManager, when we're doing that.\n\n389\n00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:27.539\nWe see this with any kind of\ninfrastructure that uses self signed\n\n390\n00:17:27.539 --> 00:17:29.085\ncertificates internally.\n\n391\n00:17:29.085 --> 00:17:32.581\nBecause if you don't install the\ncertificates into the certificate store,\n\n392\n00:17:32.581 --> 00:17:36.022\nlike what we're talking about up here,\nand make them available locally and\n\n393\n00:17:36.022 --> 00:17:39.838\napprove them so that they are registered\nand available, we get the warning prompt,\n\n394\n00:17:39.838 --> 00:17:41.080\nlike you were saying.\n\n395\n00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:44.302\nBecause we don't trust\nthe origination point.\n\n396\n00:17:44.302 --> 00:17:47.854\nYou as the user do not trust the target\nwhere you're trying to connect to.\n\n397\n00:17:47.854 --> 00:17:50.470\nYou have no knowledge of it,\nyou don't know who it is, or what it is.\n\n398\n00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:53.560\nNow that doesn't prevent you,\nas you said from actually engaging and\n\n399\n00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:57.530\ngoing through that, but\nit does cause an additional usually one or\n\n400\n00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:01.260\ntwo clicks to have to be generated,\nclick through that.\n\n401\n00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:02.850\nYou may not be able to\nauthenticate directly,\n\n402\n00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:05.670\nyou might have to click through\nseveral screens before you get there.\n\n403\n00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:09.088\nEnd users tend to get confused by this,\nand they say well the sites broken,\n\n404\n00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:10.942\nit's not working, or it's not secure.\n\n405\n00:18:10.942 --> 00:18:14.474\nIf we've done a good job of doing our\nsecurity awareness and training, and\n\n406\n00:18:14.474 --> 00:18:18.550\nraised everybody's threat awareness and\noperational or situational awareness.\n\n407\n00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:20.640\nThey may be going, no,\nI can't click on that.\n\n408\n00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.980\nCherokee kept saying, red is bad,\ndon't click on it when you see it.\n\n409\n00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:26.480\nSo they're stuck sitting at the screen,\nthey can't log in.\n\n410\n00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.720\nSo there are reasons why this\ncan go sideways on you, right?\n\n411\n00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:33.200\nBut again, the idea would be\nmanage certificates effectively.\n\n412\n00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.970\nInstall them,\ntrust them love them, care for\n\n413\n00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:38.760\nthem, cherish them as you would\nanything that's important.\n\n414\n00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.216\nAnd if you do that you're less\nlikely to have these issues.\n\n415\n00:18:41.216 --> 00:18:44.830\nSo it is a very important distinction and\none that you're right to call out.\n\n416\n00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:48.730\nSo we do have the general tab here and\nthen we have our details here.\n\n417\n00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:52.102\nThis is where we get into all the things\nthat are the fields that tend to get\n\n418\n00:18:52.102 --> 00:18:52.725\nmapped out.\n\n419\n00:18:52.725 --> 00:18:55.640\nI know it may be hard to see so\nI'll highlight some of them just so\n\n420\n00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:56.853\nas we go down you can tell.\n\n421\n00:18:56.853 --> 00:18:59.820\nYou can see version here and\nit does say V3 under value.\n\n422\n00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.320\nThis is the X509V3 V3,\n\n423\n00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:07.330\nthe version 3 template that we're\ntalking about, that is a V3 template.\n\n424\n00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:10.810\nWe do have a serial number,\na unique thumbprint identifier for\n\n425\n00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:14.010\nthis particular certificate,\neveryone is uniquely identified.\n\n426\n00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:17.120\nSignature algorithm,\nwhat are we using to do our signature,\n\n427\n00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.330\nour SHA1 RSA algorithm is being used here.\n\n428\n00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:22.560\nOur hash algorithm is SHA1,\n\n429\n00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:28.400\nif you remember our conversations\nabout hashing in our earlier episodes.\n\n430\n00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.956\nWe are using here a hashing algorithm,\n\n431\n00:19:30.956 --> 00:19:36.750\nSHA1 really called SHA 160, puts out\n160 bit value for the hash output.\n\n432\n00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:40.170\nSo we would see 160 bit output for\nthat, when we use that.\n\n433\n00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:42.370\nWe have the issuer, who is the assurer.\n\n434\n00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:45.486\nWe have the fully qualified name for\nthe issuer,\n\n435\n00:19:45.486 --> 00:19:49.522\nthe distinguished name is what\nwe refer to it as the CNO, UONC.\n\n436\n00:19:49.522 --> 00:19:52.800\nSo DigiCert, you can see here,\nif you can see that.\n\n437\n00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.610\nIf not,\nget a little closer to the screen, right?\n\n438\n00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:55.900\nI don't bite, I promise.\n\n439\n00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:59.542\nAnd you can see that DigiCert\nis actually the issuer.\n\n440\n00:19:59.542 --> 00:20:02.603\nAnd we can see here, thank you very much.\n\n441\n00:20:02.603 --> 00:20:05.440\nWe could see the valid from, and\nwe could see the validity period.\n\n442\n00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.610\nNow we saw that, cuz we saw that on\nthe front end on the general tab.\n\n443\n00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:10.775\nBut we see valid from, valid to.\n\n444\n00:20:10.775 --> 00:20:14.878\nWe see subject, so we could see\nthe subject that this was issued to.\n\n445\n00:20:14.878 --> 00:20:15.842\nWe could see that.\n\n446\n00:20:15.842 --> 00:20:19.554\nWe see the public key,\nit's an RSA 2048 bit key.\n\n447\n00:20:19.554 --> 00:20:22.807\nIn case you've never seen an RSA\n2048 bit key before it looks\n\n448\n00:20:22.807 --> 00:20:25.880\nkind of like the Matrix,\nthis is the cool part, watch.\n\n449\n00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:28.842\nKind of squint a little bit, and I'm\ngoing to go up and down really quickly.\n\n450\n00:20:28.842 --> 00:20:31.971\nAnd if you look really quick, you can see\nthe girl in the red dress is right there\n\n451\n00:20:31.971 --> 00:20:33.680\nin the middle of the matrix, right?\n\n452\n00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.830\nSo that's what it looks like,\ncuz it looks kind of like the waterfall,\n\n453\n00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:38.580\nright, of all the individual\nlittle bits in the matrix.\n\n454\n00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.012\nYou wonder where they\nget these ideas from.\n\n455\n00:20:40.012 --> 00:20:42.380\nThey were probably sitting up one night,\nit was two in the morning.\n\n456\n00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:46.389\nThey're tired, right, and they're going up\nand down on the certificate thing going,\n\n457\n00:20:46.389 --> 00:20:47.950\nhow can we make a movie out of this.\n\n458\n00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:51.824\nThe brothers, the Wachowski brothers and\nthey're like, that's it right there.\n\n459\n00:20:51.824 --> 00:20:55.011\nThat's the matrix, and\nthat's where it came from, boys and girls.\n\n460\n00:20:55.011 --> 00:20:57.304\nThat's not the story, by the way,\nI'm just making it up.\n\n461\n00:20:57.304 --> 00:20:59.122\nBut I'm sticking to it, if anybody asks.\n\n462\n00:20:59.122 --> 00:21:01.780\nSo we have the public\nkey parameters in here.\n\n463\n00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:06.090\nGot our Subject Key Identifier,\nunique string, authority key identifier.\n\n464\n00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:08.955\nPortions of the unique\nidentifier that is broken out.\n\n465\n00:21:08.955 --> 00:21:10.268\nWe have our key usage statement.\n\n466\n00:21:10.268 --> 00:21:11.483\nWhat's it used for?\n\n467\n00:21:11.483 --> 00:21:16.007\nDigital signature, certificate,\nsigning, offline CRL signing,\n\n468\n00:21:16.007 --> 00:21:19.120\nCRL signing online and offline.\n\n469\n00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:19.880\nWe could see this.\n\n470\n00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:26.152\nWe have our basic constraints,\nno constraints, here, for path length.\n\n471\n00:21:26.152 --> 00:21:30.490\nAnd we have our friendly name of\nthe assure digicert, and we have,\n\n472\n00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:32.819\njust some additional fields here.\n\n473\n00:21:32.819 --> 00:21:36.371\nAnd so we have all of this information\nthat's mapped in the certificate.\n\n474\n00:21:36.371 --> 00:21:38.596\nAnd this is part of\nthe standard V3 template,\n\n475\n00:21:38.596 --> 00:21:42.180\nwhich means any certificate I go look\nat is gonna have all these fields.\n\n476\n00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:43.900\nThere's gonna be different information,\nof course, for\n\n477\n00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:45.780\neach field, but\nthey will have the standard field.\n\n478\n00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:48.247\nSo you do wanna know what\nthe common fields are.\n\n479\n00:21:48.247 --> 00:21:51.050\nIt will be very important for\nyou to be aware of that for the exam.\n\n480\n00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:55.298\nNow we can go through and we can look\nat and see, if you pull down here,\n\n481\n00:21:55.298 --> 00:21:59.202\nthat there are certain fields\nthat are going to be filterable.\n\n482\n00:21:59.202 --> 00:22:03.090\nSo we can see just Version 1 fields,\nthe Version 1 template fields.\n\n483\n00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:04.590\nWe could see extensions only.\n\n484\n00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:07.997\nSo we could subdivide the information,\nessentially it's filtering it out.\n\n485\n00:22:07.997 --> 00:22:12.794\nCritical extensions, and properties only,\nso it's broken up by categories.\n\n486\n00:22:12.794 --> 00:22:15.279\nAnd if we want to subdivide\nthat we can certainly do that.\n\n487\n00:22:15.279 --> 00:22:17.700\nBut we can see, by default, we see all.\n\n488\n00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:22.555\nAnd then the certification path is gonna\nbe the trust hierarchy where we get this\n\n489\n00:22:22.555 --> 00:22:26.045\nfrom and how many levels or\nlayers of trust we go through.\n\n490\n00:22:26.045 --> 00:22:30.205\nNow, this is a root CA certificate, so\nit is at the first, or highest, level.\n\n491\n00:22:30.205 --> 00:22:32.560\nBecause it's self signed,\nit's issued to itself.\n\n492\n00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:36.823\nBut when we get rid of this one, and\nlet's go down to the intermediate or\n\n493\n00:22:36.823 --> 00:22:39.470\nsubordinate CA that we were talking about.\n\n494\n00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:41.890\nI don't have a DigiCert\nintermediate CA certificate so\n\n495\n00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:43.801\nwe're going to use the Kimodo one instead.\n\n496\n00:22:43.801 --> 00:22:48.157\nJust because I don't have one\nfrom DigiCert installed here, but\n\n497\n00:22:48.157 --> 00:22:52.206\nlet's go over here and\nlet's go to the certification path.\n\n498\n00:22:52.206 --> 00:22:54.226\nAnd then we'll see, can we go\nfull screen for just a second, so\n\n499\n00:22:54.226 --> 00:22:55.740\nI can zoom in a little bit more on that?\n\n500\n00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:58.170\nSo you'll see that we\ndo have a trust path,\n\n501\n00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:02.210\na certification path here, this is the\ncertificate we're looking at right now.\n\n502\n00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:07.014\nIt was issued by a route CA above us, and\nwe actually can go up and we can see and\n\n503\n00:23:07.014 --> 00:23:11.462\ngo up one level and view the certificate\nfrom up above in the cert path.\n\n504\n00:23:11.462 --> 00:23:15.610\nAnd we can actually tell the information\nabout that certificate or validate that\n\n505\n00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:19.960\nand see, we'll just put that off to side\nso that you can see it, that it matches.\n\n506\n00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:25.480\nSo we actually in the subordinate CA is we\nlook at the trust hierarchy or trust path.\n\n507\n00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:30.071\nThe certification path shows us where we\ncame from, essentially gives us that view\n\n508\n00:23:30.071 --> 00:23:33.498\nall the way back up and\nwe can validate every step in the chain.\n\n509\n00:23:33.498 --> 00:23:35.793\nNow, there is other thing,\nstay on full screen for second,\n\n510\n00:23:35.793 --> 00:23:37.381\ncuz I wanna show you one other thing here.\n\n511\n00:23:37.381 --> 00:23:40.190\nAnd you have to be able to see\nit full screen to understand it.\n\n512\n00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:44.495\nWhen we look here and Cherokee,\nwe were talking about this, right?\n\n513\n00:23:44.495 --> 00:23:45.554\nYou were mentioning hey,\n\n514\n00:23:45.554 --> 00:23:47.920\ncertain certificates come\nup that may not be valid.\n\n515\n00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.303\nThere may be something wrong, and\nthey may be expired or whatever.\n\n516\n00:23:50.303 --> 00:23:54.110\nWe will see them with a little red circle\nand a white x, typically on the side,\n\n517\n00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:56.815\nwhen we look at them here,\nbecause there is a problem.\n\n518\n00:23:56.815 --> 00:23:59.583\nIntegrity of this certificate\ncannot be guaranteed,\n\n519\n00:23:59.583 --> 00:24:02.660\nthis certificate may be corrupted or\nmay have been altered.\n\n520\n00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:04.595\nIn other words, there's a warning here,\n\n521\n00:24:04.595 --> 00:24:06.756\nthis is the exact thing\nyou were talking about.\n\n522\n00:24:06.756 --> 00:24:11.038\nWe can see that, and we see that it\nshows on the root certification path\n\n523\n00:24:11.038 --> 00:24:12.840\nthat there is a problem.\n\n524\n00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:16.860\nSo visually we get this warning in lots of\ndifferent ways, when we would use it and\n\n525\n00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:18.400\nactually connect with it we would see it,\n\n526\n00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:21.730\nbut we also see it here\nin the certificate store.\n\n527\n00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:24.920\nSo we can see all the different\ninformation in the fields that we map.\n\n528\n00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:28.487\n&gt;&gt; Now, what was that fancy\nterm that you used for,\n\n529\n00:24:28.487 --> 00:24:33.710\nI was gonna say a third party CA, or\na public CA, but it started with a c.\n\n530\n00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:35.818\n&gt;&gt; A commercial.\n&gt;&gt; Just a commercial CA?\n\n531\n00:24:35.818 --> 00:24:36.855\n&gt;&gt; Commercial CA.\n\n532\n00:24:36.855 --> 00:24:39.647\nA commercial CA is simply\na certificate authority,\n\n533\n00:24:39.647 --> 00:24:43.080\nan issuing authority that we\nrefer to that sells certificates.\n\n534\n00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:43.970\n&gt;&gt; Commercial's not too fancy.\n\n535\n00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:45.501\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, it's not fancy.\n\n536\n00:24:45.501 --> 00:24:46.287\n&gt;&gt; What was I thinking of?\n\n537\n00:24:46.287 --> 00:24:47.109\n&gt;&gt; No, not at all.\n\n538\n00:24:47.109 --> 00:24:49.503\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's very plebian, and ordinary, and\n\n539\n00:24:49.503 --> 00:24:52.540\ngeneric, but if you think of it\nas fancy then I'll go with that.\n\n540\n00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:54.520\nBut the commercial CA title, the name,\n\n541\n00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:59.900\njust the thought process is just simply\nthe term we use to refer to companies or\n\n542\n00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:04.240\ngroups like RSA, Thawte, Verisign,\nthat sell certificates, GoDaddy,\n\n543\n00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:07.150\nthat are in the business of commercially\nmaking certificates available.\n\n544\n00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:09.506\nWe just call them commercial CAs,\nthat's just what we refer to them as.\n\n545\n00:25:09.506 --> 00:25:12.765\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I noticed some of those,\nif you're going to maybe a financial\n\n546\n00:25:12.765 --> 00:25:16.262\ninstitution or something,\nthey have that high assurance certificate.\n\n547\n00:25:16.262 --> 00:25:20.746\nWhenever I think the company, the entity,\nhas to provide additional information to\n\n548\n00:25:20.746 --> 00:25:24.060\nauthenticate before getting,\nobtaining that certificate.\n\n549\n00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:25.956\n&gt;&gt; So there are different\ncategories of certificates.\n\n550\n00:25:25.956 --> 00:25:26.746\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n551\n00:25:26.746 --> 00:25:29.986\n&gt;&gt; You say high assurance, and\nthere are different categories that we can\n\n552\n00:25:29.986 --> 00:25:33.010\nessentially acquire, we really rent them,\nwe don't buy them and\n\n553\n00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:37.230\nown them unless we digitally, or excuse\nme, self sign these digital certificates.\n\n554\n00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:41.615\nWe don't really own them, because what\nwe're doing is we're paying a fee,\n\n555\n00:25:41.615 --> 00:25:46.068\na yearly fee, to a commercial CA to issue\na certificate and essentially extend\n\n556\n00:25:46.068 --> 00:25:49.457\nthe trust of that certificate and\nthat brand to us for a fee.\n\n557\n00:25:49.457 --> 00:25:53.456\nAnd we rent that, because if we violate\nthe rules of ownership, or usage, or\n\n558\n00:25:53.456 --> 00:25:57.026\nborrowance, they revoke that\ncertificate as we've talked about,\n\n559\n00:25:57.026 --> 00:26:00.855\nand if we don't pay our bills as\nyou've suggested, they revoke it.\n\n560\n00:26:00.855 --> 00:26:03.692\nSo we really are just borrowing\ncertificates from them for a period\n\n561\n00:26:03.692 --> 00:26:07.877\nof time, and we're paying them to extend\ntheir good name and their trust to us and\n\n562\n00:26:07.877 --> 00:26:13.472\nenvelop us, put us inside the perimeter\nof trust that they have given their name.\n\n563\n00:26:13.472 --> 00:26:17.786\nAnd so, there are different categories\nof grades of certificates that you can\n\n564\n00:26:17.786 --> 00:26:23.036\ngo out and essentially acquire,\nif you will, for a fee from these CAs.\n\n565\n00:26:23.036 --> 00:26:27.016\nHigh assurance is one,\nthere are a very large, or\n\n566\n00:26:27.016 --> 00:26:31.176\nthere is a very large amount of\ninformation somebody would have to provide\n\n567\n00:26:31.176 --> 00:26:33.888\nas part of the application process\nto get some of these certificates.\n\n568\n00:26:33.888 --> 00:26:37.930\nThey wanna see financials\nfrom the company you are.\n\n569\n00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:42.200\nSo if you go and try to get a certificate\nfrom Verisign, from Thawte,\n\n570\n00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:46.660\nfrom RSA as an individual,\na private certificate just for\n\n571\n00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:48.397\nyou to represent you, you won't have to-\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee.com?\n\n572\n00:26:48.397 --> 00:26:50.590\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, something like that.\n\n573\n00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:53.386\nYou won't have to present a lot\nof additional information, but\n\n574\n00:26:53.386 --> 00:26:55.111\nthey're gonna wanna know who you are.\n\n575\n00:26:55.111 --> 00:26:59.038\nThey're gonna probably want email,\nand phone number, and\n\n576\n00:26:59.038 --> 00:27:03.900\nbusiness information about you,\nthey may ask for references typically.\n\n577\n00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:07.724\nBut when you get into like hey, we wanna\nbe able to sell stuff to people, and\n\n578\n00:27:07.724 --> 00:27:09.971\nwe wanna be able to do\nelectronic commerce,\n\n579\n00:27:09.971 --> 00:27:13.730\nand meet PCI DSS compliance requirements,\nand things like that.\n\n580\n00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:16.946\nThose certificates that validate some\nof those sites you've gotta provide\n\n581\n00:27:16.946 --> 00:27:20.212\nfinancials, you've gotta be a registered\ncompany, they want your Dunn and\n\n582\n00:27:20.212 --> 00:27:23.820\nBradstreet registration, they want\nauditable financials for a few years.\n\n583\n00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:28.800\nI mean, it's a very, incredibly,\nmicroscopically detailed process.\n\n584\n00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:32.590\nBecause what they're doing is they're\nsaying look, everybody trusts us,\n\n585\n00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:34.390\nif we're gonna put our\ngood name on the line and\n\n586\n00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:37.595\nsay we trust you,\nyou gotta be squeaky clean.\n\n587\n00:27:37.595 --> 00:27:42.191\nBecause if you screw it up, you blow it\nfor not just you, but you blow it for us,\n\n588\n00:27:42.191 --> 00:27:45.060\nand we can't then sell that trust anymore.\n\n589\n00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:49.359\nSo they are incredibly, they being\nthe issuer, they are the commercial CA,\n\n590\n00:27:49.359 --> 00:27:53.793\nincredibly, incredibly focused on being\nable to validate every aspect of your\n\n591\n00:27:53.793 --> 00:27:56.490\nbusiness, your life, what you claim.\n\n592\n00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:58.912\nAnd they monitor your usage\nwith a microscope, and\n\n593\n00:27:58.912 --> 00:28:02.910\nif they see anything they don't like that\ncertificate gets pulled automatically,\n\n594\n00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:05.240\nimmediately, without even a question.\n\n595\n00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.330\nSo it's a very involved process, so yeah,\n\n596\n00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:11.700\nthere is a very high degree of validation\nthat goes with commercial CAs typically.\n\n597\n00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:12.384\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n598\n00:28:12.384 --> 00:28:16.104\n&gt;&gt; Very cool, some would say,\nwhat was the term you used?\n\n599\n00:28:16.104 --> 00:28:17.464\n&gt;&gt; Fancy?\n\n600\n00:28:17.464 --> 00:28:19.038\n&gt;&gt; Fancy, some would say fancy.\n\n601\n00:28:19.038 --> 00:28:21.898\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I wouldn't say that, I would not, but\n\n602\n00:28:21.898 --> 00:28:23.617\nCherokee does, Cherokee would say that.\n\n603\n00:28:23.617 --> 00:28:25.210\n&gt;&gt; Not like our diagrams that\nwe're about to look at, though.\n\n604\n00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:26.750\n&gt;&gt; Not like our diagrams\nwe're about to look at.\n\n605\n00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:28.189\nAll right, so before-\n&gt;&gt; Which I have right here on my own.\n\n606\n00:28:28.189 --> 00:28:30.997\n&gt;&gt; You do, and so before we go there,\nbefore we go there,\n\n607\n00:28:30.997 --> 00:28:33.415\nwanna talk about some\ndifferent extensions.\n\n608\n00:28:33.415 --> 00:28:34.952\nWe talked about what's in a certificate.\n\n609\n00:28:34.952 --> 00:28:36.356\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Wanna talk about the file\n\n610\n00:28:36.356 --> 00:28:40.225\nextensions associated with certificates\nbecause not all certificates are going to,\n\n611\n00:28:40.225 --> 00:28:44.165\nessentially, be created the same way,\nnot all certificates do the same things.\n\n612\n00:28:44.165 --> 00:28:47.099\nAnd we often think about the .cer\nextension for certificates, it's pretty,\n\n613\n00:28:47.099 --> 00:28:49.835\nat least if you know about certificates,\nit's probably pretty common.\n\n614\n00:28:49.835 --> 00:28:54.615\nAnd you would think about that, or perhaps\n.crt, you may see one or both of those,\n\n615\n00:28:54.615 --> 00:28:56.677\nthose are common, .der, right.\n\n616\n00:28:56.677 --> 00:28:58.347\nSo there's a lot of different extensions.\n\n617\n00:28:58.347 --> 00:29:01.552\nThere's .pem for privacy enhanced mail,\nor what are called PEM certificates.\n\n618\n00:29:01.552 --> 00:29:08.782\nThere's p7b, p7c, pkcs, # or number seven,\nyou may know that commonly PKCS number 12,\n\n619\n00:29:08.782 --> 00:29:13.805\nthese are different standards\nthat we issue against, and .pfx.\n\n620\n00:29:13.805 --> 00:29:16.665\nSo let's just talk about these for\na minute more than we already have,\n\n621\n00:29:16.665 --> 00:29:19.643\nlet me just quickly define them for\nyou and tell you what they are.\n\n622\n00:29:19.643 --> 00:29:22.133\nSo .pem, as I said, privacy enhanced mail.\n\n623\n00:29:22.133 --> 00:29:26.350\nThese extensions, or these certificates\nrather, are the ones that you will often\n\n624\n00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:30.210\nsee when we issue a certificate and\nwe go out and we copy the key.\n\n625\n00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:32.764\nEspecially if you do\nself signed certificates,\n\n626\n00:29:32.764 --> 00:29:36.627\nyou will see them where the issuer\nstatement starts with a bunch of lines,\n\n627\n00:29:36.627 --> 00:29:40.860\nand then it says begin certificate,\nthen another series of dashed lines.\n\n628\n00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:43.660\nAnd then you have the whole\ncertificate key itself, and\n\n629\n00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:46.186\nthen below it has another\nset of dashed lines,\n\n630\n00:29:46.186 --> 00:29:49.390\nit says end certificate in capitals,\nand then another set of dashed lines.\n\n631\n00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:52.478\nSo it's got the body of a certificate\nbetween these two brackets, and\n\n632\n00:29:52.478 --> 00:29:55.509\nyou need the whole thing with the quotes\nin order to be able to copy it,\n\n633\n00:29:55.509 --> 00:29:58.468\nthat's a PEM certificate,\nthat's what it often will look like.\n\n634\n00:29:58.468 --> 00:30:02.653\nIt's a base 64 encoded digital, or encoded\ndistinguished encoding rule certificate.\n\n635\n00:30:02.653 --> 00:30:06.194\nMeaning it uses base 64 encoding and\nit is a DER, or\n\n636\n00:30:06.194 --> 00:30:11.266\na distinguished encoding rules\ncertificate enclosed between the open and\n\n637\n00:30:11.266 --> 00:30:15.860\nclosed statements of begin certificate and\nend certificate.\n\n638\n00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:19.420\nThat's what a .pem or .pem certificate\nwill look like, or a PEM certificate.\n\n639\n00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:24.466\nA .cer, .crt, .der is going to\nbe different extensions for,\n\n640\n00:30:24.466 --> 00:30:28.490\nas I said, DER,\ndistinguished encoding rules.\n\n641\n00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:32.460\nGotta keep looking that up cuz I\nnever remember what DER stands for.\n\n642\n00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:35.230\nBut distinguished coding rules,\nthese are just extensions for\n\n643\n00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:36.960\ndifferent types of certificates.\n\n644\n00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.180\nThese are typically binary encoded, so\n\n645\n00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:42.330\nyou'll see them as\na binary encoded string.\n\n646\n00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:45.970\nBut sometimes we may also see base 64\nencoded certificates operating this way,\n\n647\n00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:48.412\nit just depends on how they're saved off.\n\n648\n00:30:48.412 --> 00:30:53.620\nPKCS #7, or PKCS standard 7,\nthis is signed data structures,\n\n649\n00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:57.530\nthis is essentially, typically,\na CRL, a certificate revocation list.\n\n650\n00:30:57.530 --> 00:31:02.854\nMore often than not we'll meet this\nparticular standard, so with .p7b,\n\n651\n00:31:02.854 --> 00:31:06.510\n.p7c, and/or PKCS #7,\n\n652\n00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:10.730\ntypically that structure is usually\ngonna be transmitting data itself so\n\n653\n00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:15.925\nit's typically a CRL usually more often\nthan not, certificate revocation list.\n\n654\n00:31:15.925 --> 00:31:19.260\n.p12, or PKCS #12 structures or\n\n655\n00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:23.850\ncertificates, typically these will have\nour actual certificate certificates.\n\n656\n00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:26.960\nThese are the public and private keys\nthat we often are dealing with, and\n\n657\n00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:30.010\nthey are password protected,\nas files more often than not.\n\n658\n00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:33.580\nYou may download these as a zip and\nthen typically you'll import them,\n\n659\n00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:36.470\nso you'll actually open them up, and\nrun a little wizard to import them,\n\n660\n00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:38.840\nand load them up, and\nthat's how we often see them.\n\n661\n00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:41.140\nYou probably had to do that when you\nwere setting up the remote desktops,\n\n662\n00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:41.860\nyou had to bring in the certificates,\nright?\n\n663\n00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:44.760\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and they're very important to\nnote, because if you don't have these\n\n664\n00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:47.632\nextensions noted properly and\nexported properly it's not going to work.\n\n665\n00:31:47.632 --> 00:31:50.200\n&gt;&gt; Or you export in a different form,\nright, the one that you're not-\n\n666\n00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:50.903\n&gt;&gt; Right different formats, yes.\n\n667\n00:31:50.903 --> 00:31:51.730\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n668\n00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:53.731\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you get an option when you\nessentially create the certificate and\n\n669\n00:31:53.731 --> 00:31:54.814\nexport it\n&gt;&gt; So pay attention.\n\n670\n00:31:54.814 --> 00:31:56.194\n&gt;&gt; If you have to choose the right one or\n\n671\n00:31:56.194 --> 00:31:59.049\nyou're exporting in a form that\ndoesn't match for their usage, right?\n\n672\n00:31:59.049 --> 00:31:59.675\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n673\n00:31:59.675 --> 00:32:01.704\n&gt;&gt; And then that's where you wind\nup with issues, right, absolutely.\n\n674\n00:32:01.704 --> 00:32:06.701\nAnd then PFX, .pfx,\nactually the predecessor to .p12,\n\n675\n00:32:06.701 --> 00:32:11.328\nbut the PKCS #12 standard,\nPFX was the predecessor.\n\n676\n00:32:11.328 --> 00:32:15.375\nIt came before, so it was just an earlier\nversion of, what we think of now,\n\n677\n00:32:15.375 --> 00:32:16.300\nas PKCS #12.\n\n678\n00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:19.350\nSo PFX certification,\nor, PFX certification,\n\n679\n00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:22.730\nPFX extension on a certificate is\njust an earlier version of that.\n\n680\n00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:26.710\nYou tend to see a lot of PFXs still,\nself sign certificates, ABCS for\n\n681\n00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:29.840\ninstance, you may get that option and\noutput that way.\n\n682\n00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:31.030\nIt's just a standard format but\n\n683\n00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:34.840\nit's just an earlier version, that's\nwhat it would be, so we do have that.\n\n684\n00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:37.540\nI know that we wanted to go to our\nstick figures and talk about them, but\n\n685\n00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:41.935\nI'm thinking it may take a little\nbit longer than the two shakes of\n\n686\n00:32:41.935 --> 00:32:45.180\nthe tail that we have left on our\ntiming here to go through this episode.\n\n687\n00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:48.333\nSo, do you concur Dr. Boose [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I do, I'm sorry guys,\n\n688\n00:32:48.333 --> 00:32:51.891\nI didn't mean to disappoint you in\nmy artistic abilities here, but-\n\n689\n00:32:51.891 --> 00:32:53.263\n&gt;&gt; Its was kind of a, it was a feint,\n\n690\n00:32:53.263 --> 00:32:56.135\nshe threw out the stick figures but\nshe's gonna have to pull it back.\n\n691\n00:32:56.135 --> 00:32:57.297\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; But the good news is,\n\n692\n00:32:57.297 --> 00:33:00.831\nif you come back and join us for the next\nepisode we're gonna start off with stick\n\n693\n00:33:00.831 --> 00:33:04.365\nfigure mania, and you are gonna see more\nstick figures than you are gonna be able\n\n694\n00:33:04.365 --> 00:33:06.220\nto shake a stick at, no pun intended.\n\n695\n00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:07.840\n&gt;&gt; Nobody can deny that.\n&gt;&gt; But you should come back and\n\n696\n00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:08.635\njoin us for that,\n\n697\n00:33:08.635 --> 00:33:11.660\ncuz it is gonna be stick-figure-tastic\nhere in just a little bit.\n\n698\n00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:16.450\n&gt;&gt; All right, well that's about as\nmuch wonderfulness as I can handle for\n\n699\n00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:19.230\none episode, so we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this one.\n\n700\n00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:20.750\nRemember, I'm Cherokee

and\nshow you those stick figures.\n\n7\n00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.540\nWith us today, we have Mr.\n\n8\n00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.490\nAdam Gordon in studios, thank you for\njoining us today, Adam.\n\n9\n00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.860\n&gt;&gt; Hello, hello,\nI'm feeling very stick figure-like.\n\n10\n00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.940\nI was gonna do a stick figure, but\n\n11\n00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.005\nI couldn't really figure out how to\ndo one quickly, spur of the moment.\n\n12\n00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:40.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So instead we're gonna show\n\n13\n00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.630\nyou one in just a moment, but\nas we did promise, as Cherokee said.\n\n14\n00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.942\nShe worked really hard on those diagrams,\nwe're gonna give her a chance to put them\n\n15\n00:00:47.942 --> 00:00:50.961\nup and help us educate you\na little bit with regards to PKI,\n\n16\n00:00:50.961 --> 00:00:53.444\nwith regards to certificate\ninfrastructure.\n\n17\n00:00:53.444 --> 00:00:56.310\nAnd before we throw the diagrams up,\nwe will in just a moment.\n\n18\n00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.400\nBut when we think about PKI, and we\ntalked about this in some prior episodes.\n\n19\n00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.804\nBut when we think about PKI,\n\n20\n00:01:02.804 --> 00:01:06.210\nwe have to think about a couple of\nkey thought processes or concepts.\n\n21\n00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.180\nNumber one, hierarchy, right, and\n\n22\n00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.490\nthe thought process of how\ndo we relate through a,\n\n23\n00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.790\neither hierarchical order, parent, child,\ngrandchild, and we think of it that way.\n\n24\n00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.978\nOr a root CA, intermediate,\nand perhaps subordinate CA,\n\n25\n00:01:20.978 --> 00:01:22.588\nif we use the language of PKI.\n\n26\n00:01:22.588 --> 00:01:26.034\nHow do we relate inheritance,\nand by extension trust,\n\n27\n00:01:26.034 --> 00:01:28.171\nthrough the PKI infrastructure?\n\n28\n00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:30.151\nSo we're gonna talk a bit about that and\n\n29\n00:01:30.151 --> 00:01:32.440\ntalk some more about\nthat with the diagrams.\n\n30\n00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.520\nBut a key theme for you to think about and\n\n31\n00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.480\nlook at as we start to develop\nour thought process here.\n\n32\n00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.720\nWe're also gonna think about what\nhappens when things go really well\n\n33\n00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.840\nwith certificates.\n\n34\n00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.250\nCertificates are issued,\npeople use them, machines use them,\n\n35\n00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.900\nwe can validate our identity,\nwe can digitally sign,\n\n36\n00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.890\ninfrastructure can be authenticated,\ndo all sorts of stuff.\n\n37\n00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.900\nBut what happens when\nthey go horribly wrong?\n\n38\n00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.770\nAnd we've talked about some situations,\nright, if people don't pay their bills,\n\n39\n00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.720\nas Cherokee reminded us of.\n\n40\n00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.200\nOr if for\nsome reason that certificate expires and\n\n41\n00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.100\nperhaps we're not paying attention to\nthat, you've had some experience with that\n\n42\n00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.030\nas well from what you related to us,\nso those kind of things can happen.\n\n43\n00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.530\nAnd we're gonna be on the lookout for\n\n44\n00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.450\ndiscussing the concept of what we call the\nCRL, the certificate revocation list, so\n\n45\n00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.550\nwe're gonna take a look at that and\ntalk about that.\n\n46\n00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.890\nWe're also gonna bring in some of\nthe optional components, that may or\n\n47\n00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.900\nmay not be part of a normal\nPKI implementation,\n\n48\n00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.800\nbecause there are different\nways we can deploy PKI.\n\n49\n00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.150\nA single tier, or one-level hierarchy,\nessentially a certificate authority\n\n50\n00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.410\nof one, so we're gonna talk about that as\nan all-in-one kind of thought process.\n\n51\n00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.630\nWe may then see a built out hierarchy\nwhere we have either a single or\n\n52\n00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.880\nmultiple level hierarchy with a root,\nperhaps an intermediate, and\n\n53\n00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.650\na subordinate, or\nperhaps just a root and a subordinate.\n\n54\n00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.490\nSo we're gonna look at different levels,\nbut we're gonna bring in some optional\n\n55\n00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.220\ncomponents that may or\nmay not normally exist.\n\n56\n00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.620\nEspecially if we do\na single level hierarchy,\n\n57\n00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.460\nwhere we have just one root\nCA that acts as a root CA,\n\n58\n00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.380\nan issuing and subordinate CA,\nan authenticator all in one.\n\n59\n00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.050\nWe would not see broken out separately the\nrole of something called a registration\n\n60\n00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.980\nauthority, and\n\n61\n00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.170\nperhaps a validating authority\ndepending on how we choose to do this.\n\n62\n00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.560\nAnd so we'll draw you out\na little bit on those issues and\n\n63\n00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.640\nthose differences as we go\nthrough these diagrams.\n\n64\n00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.540\nAnd then in addition,\nwe're gonna take a look at and\n\n65\n00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.860\ntalk about ways that we can use that CRL,\nthat certificate revocation list,\n\n66\n00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.440\nto validate whether or\nnot a certificate is legitimate.\n\n67\n00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.370\nAnd we do this, historically it's\nbeen a very person intensive or\n\n68\n00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.890\nmanually intensive process where\nwe have to download a CRL,\n\n69\n00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.700\ntypically into an application, and\nhave the application work through that.\n\n70\n00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.830\nWe do have an automation capability we can\nthrow in there, something known as OCSP,\n\n71\n00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.420\nthe online certificate status protocol,\nso we'll take a look at that.\n\n72\n00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.180\nAlso something known as server based\ncertificate validation protocol, SCVP,\n\n73\n00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.490\nwhich is not as well known as OCSP.\n\n74\n00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.489\nA lot of people don't realize that exists,\nit's actually been around for\n\n75\n00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.803\na while, based on an RFC standard,\nRFC 5055, and we'll talk about that and\n\n76\n00:04:03.803 --> 00:04:04.965\nwhat that is as well.\n\n77\n00:04:04.965 --> 00:04:09.056\nAnd if we have any time left after\nthat I'm gonna do a handstand.\n\n78\n00:04:09.056 --> 00:04:09.849\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n79\n00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.035\nthat's gonna be cool because\nI cannot do handstands, so\n\n80\n00:04:12.035 --> 00:04:13.592\nwe're gonna see if that works out well.\n\n81\n00:04:13.592 --> 00:04:17.858\nI remember, this is our random aside for\nour episode by the way, I remember years\n\n82\n00:04:17.858 --> 00:04:22.248\nago, and this is a long time, you can tell\nI'm not the youngest of people anymore,\n\n83\n00:04:22.248 --> 00:04:24.218\nbut I did gymnastics when I was a kid.\n\n84\n00:04:24.218 --> 00:04:27.001\nYou may have, I don't know if you\nwere into that kind of stuff, but\n\n85\n00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:30.240\nI did when I was a kid and I was\nactually pretty good at it for a while.\n\n86\n00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.460\nNot good enough like crazy\nOlympic gold good, but\n\n87\n00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.620\ngood like it was cool when you're eight\nyears old and that's what you do good.\n\n88\n00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.850\nSo I did gymnastics when I was a little\nkid and I had a lot of fun doing it, and\n\n89\n00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:40.780\nI was actually really good.\n\n90\n00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.820\nI used to be able to tumble,\nI did the bars, did all sorts of stuff.\n\n91\n00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.360\nThen I became an adult,\nand something happened and\n\n92\n00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.000\nI can no longer do a handstand,\nI can't even do a cartwheel.\n\n93\n00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.465\n&gt;&gt; I could never do\na cartwheel my entire life, so\n\n94\n00:04:51.465 --> 00:04:52.687\nyou're- [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's tragic,\n\n95\n00:04:52.687 --> 00:04:53.690\nI used to be able to do all that stuff.\n\n96\n00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:59.720\nWhen I was a little kid I was nimble and I\nwas probably all of 25 pounds soaking wet.\n\n97\n00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.850\nBut when you're little I guess you're\nflexible and you can do that stuff.\n\n98\n00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.563\nBut when you become an adult all of\na sudden those things just don't\n\n99\n00:05:05.563 --> 00:05:08.041\nwork the right way anymore, so\nI can no longer do that stuff.\n\n100\n00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:11.893\nBut when I used to be able to do it,\nboy it was a lot of fun, it was cool.\n\n101\n00:05:11.893 --> 00:05:14.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now that I'm done reminiscing,\n\n102\n00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.460\nwe need that crazy kind of cool background\nlike when you do the reminiscing thing in\n\n103\n00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.780\nthe movies or in the cartoons.\n\n104\n00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:19.340\n&gt;&gt; Psychedelic.\n\n105\n00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they do the kind of shimmery\nthing and you do the flashback.\n\n106\n00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.286\nWe need all those effects, we gotta get\nsomebody working on all that stuff,\n\n107\n00:05:25.286 --> 00:05:26.027\nthat would be so cool.\n\n108\n00:05:26.027 --> 00:05:29.137\n&gt;&gt; I'm telling you, sound bars,\nor the sound effect panels.\n\n109\n00:05:29.137 --> 00:05:31.498\n&gt;&gt; Not only, we need sound effects,\nwe need that too, but\n\n110\n00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:33.725\nwe need the visual effects,\nthat would be cool too.\n\n111\n00:05:33.725 --> 00:05:35.098\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n112\n00:05:35.098 --> 00:05:37.810\nspeaking of visual effects,\nwe are gonna go and are we ready?\n\n113\n00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, our visual aid is up.\n\n114\n00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.790\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so we are gonna go if we could,\nthere we go, right up over there,\n\n115\n00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:43.543\nright there.\n\n116\n00:05:43.543 --> 00:05:45.119\nSo we're gonna talk about certificates.\n\n117\n00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:48.426\nSo this is what we call\na one-level hierarchy, or\n\n118\n00:05:48.426 --> 00:05:51.669\nsimply just a all-in-one deployment for\nPKI.\n\n119\n00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:55.885\nAnd we'll see here, great labeling and\ngreat stick figuring by the way,\n\n120\n00:05:55.885 --> 00:05:57.041\nI see Alice and Bob.\n\n121\n00:05:57.041 --> 00:05:59.698\nAlthough that could be Bob's evil twin,\nthe thread actor,\n\n122\n00:05:59.698 --> 00:06:01.426\nthe bad actor from our other diagrams.\n\n123\n00:06:01.426 --> 00:06:04.130\nYou may have just taken him and\ncould have spruced him up a little.\n\n124\n00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.150\n&gt;&gt; You'll never know.\n&gt;&gt; We'll never know.\n\n125\n00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.580\nWe don't know who he is,\nhe's the unknown quantity, but\n\n126\n00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.880\nwe have your traditional\nusers and/or computer.\n\n127\n00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.750\nSo remember certificates can be issued\neither to a user, or a computer, or\n\n128\n00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.560\na device of some kind, right,\nin theory that could be a cellphone,\n\n129\n00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.680\ncould be a mobile device,\na tablet, whatever it may be.\n\n130\n00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.671\nAlso, we have things that\nare consuming certificates\n\n131\n00:06:21.671 --> 00:06:22.935\ndown there at the bottom, right.\n\n132\n00:06:22.935 --> 00:06:27.687\nBut what we have is our root and issuing\nCA, so the big machine up at the kinda\n\n133\n00:06:27.687 --> 00:06:31.462\ncenter of that diagram with\narrows radiating down from it,\n\n134\n00:06:31.462 --> 00:06:35.762\nis going to be where users are gonna\ngo to request certificates, but\n\n135\n00:06:35.762 --> 00:06:37.897\nalso to get them in a single step.\n\n136\n00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:42.159\nAnd we do have our little square tile\ncertificate sitting up there, and\n\n137\n00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:45.581\nwe have our x 509v3\ncertificate represented there.\n\n138\n00:06:45.581 --> 00:06:48.781\nSo the interesting thing about\nthis particular solution,\n\n139\n00:06:48.781 --> 00:06:51.469\nas I mentioned all-in-one,\nis that the root and\n\n140\n00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:55.191\nissuing CA functionality obviously\nclearly exists in one machine.\n\n141\n00:06:55.191 --> 00:06:59.961\nBut because of that we are going to,\nin a [COUGH] nontraditional way,\n\n142\n00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:05.233\ndeploy PKI inside of an infrastructure,\ninside of an organization that,\n\n143\n00:07:05.233 --> 00:07:10.338\nalthough it works, although it is\nperfectly fine, it is a legitimate,\n\n144\n00:07:10.338 --> 00:07:16.197\nwell documented, time tested practice in\narchitectural design to do it this way,\n\n145\n00:07:16.197 --> 00:07:21.770\nthere are some security liabilities we\nhave to think about with this, right.\n\n146\n00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:25.480\nAnd we do have to be aware of the fact\nthat although we can do this,\n\n147\n00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.310\nit does open us up\npotentially to liability.\n\n148\n00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:32.600\nBecause we are allowing the root CA, and\nwe talked about the value of the root\n\n149\n00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.825\nCA in our prior conversation,\nour prior episode around certificates, and\n\n150\n00:07:36.825 --> 00:07:40.335\nthe need to establish that hierarchy,\nthat chain of trust, right.\n\n151\n00:07:40.335 --> 00:07:44.552\nBut also the cut out that the intermediate\nand subordinate CAs provide so\n\n152\n00:07:44.552 --> 00:07:47.180\nthat you don't talk\ndirectly to the root CA,\n\n153\n00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.931\npotentially exposing certificates\nfrom the root CA directly.\n\n154\n00:07:50.931 --> 00:07:54.837\nAnd if they are compromised, allowing\nus to essentially go into business for\n\n155\n00:07:54.837 --> 00:07:59.101\nourselves, right, and not only see, and\nauthenticate, and interact with our own\n\n156\n00:07:59.101 --> 00:08:03.271\nDevices, but potentially compromise\neverything that is linked to that Root CA.\n\n157\n00:08:03.271 --> 00:08:05.289\nAnd so while we understand and\n\n158\n00:08:05.289 --> 00:08:08.610\nwe certainly acknowledge\nthat this may be done.\n\n159\n00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.070\nI've seen this done for many students and\n\n160\n00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:14.620\ncustomers, talked about this over\nthe years with many individuals.\n\n161\n00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.197\nTalked through different\narchitectural thought processes, and\n\n162\n00:08:17.197 --> 00:08:20.428\nthis has been the desired outcome for many\nof them, and I have no trouble with that.\n\n163\n00:08:20.428 --> 00:08:24.441\nBut I always tell my customers and my\nstudents If you're going to go this way,\n\n164\n00:08:24.441 --> 00:08:25.984\nyou have to accept the risk and\n\n165\n00:08:25.984 --> 00:08:29.220\nthe liability associated\nwith this deployment model.\n\n166\n00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.260\nAnd you have to not only document that.\n\n167\n00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.060\nGood oversight, good risk management.\n\n168\n00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:33.770\nGood governance.\n\n169\n00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:36.210\nGood risk control and compliance.\n\n170\n00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:39.100\nBut we also have to put\nin compensating controls.\n\n171\n00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:42.720\nAnd additional counter measures that\nwill help to offset the liability.\n\n172\n00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:47.010\nAssociated with single use root CA and\nself-signing certificates,\n\n173\n00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:50.030\nwhich is essentially what\nwe're typically doing here.\n\n174\n00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.651\nWhen we issue our own certificates,\nwe're self-signing.\n\n175\n00:08:52.651 --> 00:08:56.097\nSelf-signing doesn't mean that Cherokee or\nI sit there, sign every certificate and\n\n176\n00:08:56.097 --> 00:08:56.718\nhand them out.\n\n177\n00:08:56.718 --> 00:09:01.248\nBut what it means is that the CA itself\nIs authenticating the certificates and\n\n178\n00:09:01.248 --> 00:09:04.395\nyou're not getting them\nfrom a trusted third party.\n\n179\n00:09:04.395 --> 00:09:08.541\nWe've used that terminology in our\nlast episode around certificates, but\n\n180\n00:09:08.541 --> 00:09:11.800\nwe had come to talk about\nas a commercial CA right?\n\n181\n00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.122\nSo, what did you call it?\n\n182\n00:09:14.122 --> 00:09:15.168\n&gt;&gt; Fancy.\n&gt;&gt; A fancy C.\n\n183\n00:09:15.168 --> 00:09:17.366\nI was gonna say high but that's.\n\n184\n00:09:17.366 --> 00:09:21.099\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] I normally just would\nsay public or third party, but\n\n185\n00:09:21.099 --> 00:09:22.938\nI guess third party\n&gt;&gt; It could be a lot of things.\n\n186\n00:09:22.938 --> 00:09:25.474\n[CROSSTALK] They are all\nkind of reuse them.\n\n187\n00:09:25.474 --> 00:09:29.251\nYou do hear everybody will use different\nterminologies, you're absolutely right,\n\n188\n00:09:29.251 --> 00:09:31.372\nyou hear because there is\nno standardization for\n\n189\n00:09:31.372 --> 00:09:34.330\nsome of this stuff as you're\nrightly pointing out.\n\n190\n00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.570\nYou do hear a lot of these different\nterms kind of just thrown out there, and\n\n191\n00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:40.620\neverybody just assumes that's\nwhat you meant, right.\n\n192\n00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.640\nSo we do hear commercial as I said,\nthat's the more formal name, but\n\n193\n00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.840\nyou do hear third party.\n\n194\n00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.340\nYou do hear other terms\nused to describe this.\n\n195\n00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:49.956\nSo you're not in any way\nwrong by saying that,\n\n196\n00:09:49.956 --> 00:09:52.988\nit's just that it's part of the confusion\nthat associates itself around this topic.\n\n197\n00:09:52.988 --> 00:09:55.338\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because it would be great if we just\n\n198\n00:09:55.338 --> 00:09:57.197\npicked one term and said it's always this.\n\n199\n00:09:57.197 --> 00:09:57.740\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n200\n00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:58.737\n&gt;&gt; And\nat least that way we would all know.\n\n201\n00:09:58.737 --> 00:10:01.680\nSo you're right because you do\nhear those other terms a lot.\n\n202\n00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.451\nYou're absolutely correct.\n\n203\n00:10:02.451 --> 00:10:06.457\nBut we would traditionally call it\na commercial CA, one that you're buying or\n\n204\n00:10:06.457 --> 00:10:10.900\nexchanging money for a good or service,\nin this case, a certificate from them.\n\n205\n00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:12.200\nYou're not self signing.\n\n206\n00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.430\nYou're getting a certificate\nfrom VeriSign,\n\n207\n00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:20.230\nRSA, whoever is that commercial CA,\nyou're getting it from them and\n\n208\n00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:22.820\nthey are passing that trust along to you,\nas we talked about.\n\n209\n00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.290\nBut vetting you, in some cases, very,\n\n210\n00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:29.510\nvery carefully before they extend\nthat trust, which is the term we use.\n\n211\n00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:31.800\nThey will extend that trust to you.\n\n212\n00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.519\nAnd so when we do it ourselves.\n\n213\n00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:38.010\nIt's an all in one solution, if we can\ngo back to diagram for just a second.\n\n214\n00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:43.440\nWhat we're seeing is that the root and/or\nissuing CA traditionally is probably\n\n215\n00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.950\nin the Windows world anyway, in the\nMicrosoft world with the active directory.\n\n216\n00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:50.840\nThis would be a domain controller that\nhas active directory certificate services\n\n217\n00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:55.630\nADCS installed as a role that is\nbeing used to issue certificates.\n\n218\n00:10:55.630 --> 00:11:00.640\nIf this is a non Microsoft world\nthis is a stand alone machine or\n\n219\n00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:04.110\nsomehow an integrated machine\ninto a directory service,\n\n220\n00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:06.870\ninto an ldap provider of some kind.\n\n221\n00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:09.020\nAnd this may be an ldap server,\n\n222\n00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:12.110\nit may also be a different\nmachine that leverages ldap.\n\n223\n00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:16.490\nBut traditionally in the all in\none we normally see that as being\n\n224\n00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:18.420\nthe ldap provider.\n\n225\n00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.220\nTaking on that additional role,\nif it is what we call and\n\n226\n00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:25.460\nenterprise route CA,\nan integrated inside the directory CA.\n\n227\n00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:27.630\nIf it is a stand alone route CA,\n\n228\n00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:30.050\nthen this is a machine that\nis outside the directory.\n\n229\n00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:32.370\nIt's what you would think\nof commonly as a workgroup.\n\n230\n00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:37.010\nIt just stands alone and is not part of\nan LDAP directory and authentication and\n\n231\n00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.660\nvalidation of user request takes place\n\n232\n00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.020\nagainst the box itself with\nwhatever credentials are provided.\n\n233\n00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:48.290\nAnd or perhaps through a third party look\nup of some kind, but we're not looking up\n\n234\n00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:51.730\ninto an LDAP directory because\nwe're not part of that directory or\n\n235\n00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:52.940\npart of that domain.\n\n236\n00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:54.670\nSo we have different options here.\n\n237\n00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:58.370\nBut this is essentially just an all\nin one or one level hierarchy.\n\n238\n00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:02.060\nLet's go, if we could,\nto our second diagram.\n\n239\n00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:04.900\nWe'll give Cherokee just a second to\nadjust that for us while we're talking.\n\n240\n00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.690\nThis is what we call a two tier hierarchy.\n\n241\n00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:11.080\nSo what we're gonna see here\nis some interesting stuff.\n\n242\n00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:15.560\nGreat organization and\nspace management there, by the way.\n\n243\n00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:16.754\n&gt;&gt; We'll see how the next one goes.\n\n244\n00:12:16.754 --> 00:12:17.720\n&gt;&gt; That was awesome.\n\n245\n00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.990\nGot that out there real quick,\nI appreciate that.\n\n246\n00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:24.320\nSo what we're looking at here is\nthe idea of actually two distinctly\n\n247\n00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.750\ndifferent processes going on.\n\n248\n00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.790\nIf you remember as we're getting started,\n\n249\n00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:31.940\nI mentioned that we would bring in\nsome of these things that are perhaps\n\n250\n00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:35.430\noptional that don't always exist\nin every PKI implementation.\n\n251\n00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:39.514\nAnd we have, off to the left,\nwe are seeing a registration authority,\n\n252\n00:12:39.514 --> 00:12:42.646\nwith an ldap provider,\ndoing some authentication and\n\n253\n00:12:42.646 --> 00:12:46.275\nvalidation of certificate request for\nus, before issuance.\n\n254\n00:12:46.275 --> 00:12:50.760\nAnd then off to the right, we see the root\nCA, going directly to a subordinate, or\n\n255\n00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.560\nissuing CA, and\nissuing certificates directly.\n\n256\n00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.280\nSo while we have an all\nin one dialogue here.\n\n257\n00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:00.230\nWe actually are showing you two\ndistinctly different visions of the same\n\n258\n00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:01.352\nthought process.\n\n259\n00:13:01.352 --> 00:13:04.732\nSo that we can illustrate both ways\nin which you may see this deployed.\n\n260\n00:13:04.732 --> 00:13:07.388\nOr both ways in which,\nyou may see this architect.\n\n261\n00:13:07.388 --> 00:13:11.990\nAs in as in enterprise,\nencryption specialist,\n\n262\n00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:17.920\ncertified EC Counsel encryption\nspecialist, as a potential ESA,\n\n263\n00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:22.510\nEnterprise Security Architect,\nas a IT Security Professional.\n\n264\n00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.767\nAs anybody who [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Network admin, network engineer?\n\n265\n00:13:24.767 --> 00:13:26.330\n&gt;&gt; Any of those, roles, right?\n\n266\n00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:30.620\nAnybody who may be called on\nto either offer guidance, and\n\n267\n00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:33.570\nto perhaps implement a PKI solution.\n\n268\n00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:36.916\nOr to take over management of one,\nthat may have already been architected or\n\n269\n00:13:36.916 --> 00:13:38.343\nimplemented by somebody else.\n\n270\n00:13:38.343 --> 00:13:42.527\nOr too, as a consultant perhaps,\nspeak knowledgeably about what\n\n271\n00:13:42.527 --> 00:13:45.890\nthe customer is either looking to do or\nis doing.\n\n272\n00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:50.720\nAs an auditor, being asked to look at\nthis infrastructure, validate it, and\n\n273\n00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:54.635\nor take a look at the risks\nassociated with different choices.\n\n274\n00:13:54.635 --> 00:13:57.825\nThere's a lot of different\nways in which people interact\n\n275\n00:13:57.825 --> 00:13:59.305\naround this thought process.\n\n276\n00:13:59.305 --> 00:14:02.527\nAnd having done a lot of these\nthings over the years and\n\n277\n00:14:02.527 --> 00:14:06.892\ncontinuing to do many of them today,\nas a consultant to some architect,\n\n278\n00:14:06.892 --> 00:14:10.418\nas a trainer, as a manager,\nas a security professional.\n\n279\n00:14:10.418 --> 00:14:14.832\nI see a lot of these different deployments\nin the wild, so to speak, right.\n\n280\n00:14:14.832 --> 00:14:17.156\nWe see a lot of different\nways of doing this.\n\n281\n00:14:17.156 --> 00:14:21.036\nAnd, while a lot of my customers will\n\n282\n00:14:21.036 --> 00:14:26.216\nuse a fairly traditional standardized\nthought process, one or more CAs.\n\n283\n00:14:26.216 --> 00:14:29.694\nSo we would have on the right\nhand side here, a root CA and\n\n284\n00:14:29.694 --> 00:14:34.433\nwe would then have one or more\nsubordinate, or subordinate/issuing CAs.\n\n285\n00:14:34.433 --> 00:14:38.028\nBecause they may be\nsubordinate CAs at one level.\n\n286\n00:14:38.028 --> 00:14:40.548\nThey could be subordinate\nCAs in multiple levels.\n\n287\n00:14:40.548 --> 00:14:42.898\nWe'll take a look at a three\ntier hierarchy in a minute.\n\n288\n00:14:42.898 --> 00:14:48.542\nBut the idea is that whatever levels we\nput in, whatever different gradations or\n\n289\n00:14:48.542 --> 00:14:54.281\narchitectural standards that we apply to\nset up multilevel hierarchies for PKI.\n\n290\n00:14:54.281 --> 00:15:00.690\nUltimately we call those sub CAs exactly\nthat subordinate and or issuing CAs.\n\n291\n00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:03.560\nAnd so when we set up a root and\nthen the root is going to\n\n292\n00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.810\nissue a certificate to one or\nmore of these subordinate CAs.\n\n293\n00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:09.750\nAnd that certificate is then\ngonna give that subordinate or\n\n294\n00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:14.600\nissuing CA the ability to issue\ncertificates on behalf of that root\n\n295\n00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.170\nto essentially be trusted by the root.\n\n296\n00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:21.550\nTo then represent it and\nto speak authoritatively on it's behalf.\n\n297\n00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:25.501\nAnd then those subordinate or\nissuing CAs they are gonna go ahead and\n\n298\n00:15:25.501 --> 00:15:29.325\nthey are gonna hand out certificates\nto as you can see computers.\n\n299\n00:15:29.325 --> 00:15:33.721\nAnd users at the bottom there based on\nwhoever shows up and whoever requests\n\n300\n00:15:33.721 --> 00:15:38.298\na certificate or whatever shows up and\nwhatever requests a certificate.\n\n301\n00:15:38.298 --> 00:15:40.090\nAssuming that the whoever or\n\n302\n00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:44.530\nwhatever is able to validate their\nidentity beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n303\n00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:48.065\nGive it whatever standards we have\nasked for validation to follow.\n\n304\n00:15:48.065 --> 00:15:52.369\nSingle, dual, multifactor authentication,\nuser name and password only,\n\n305\n00:15:52.369 --> 00:15:56.292\nuser name and password plus something\nelse, whatever the case may be.\n\n306\n00:15:56.292 --> 00:15:57.894\nThere's all these variables,\n\n307\n00:15:57.894 --> 00:16:02.107\nwe're not gonna go into every permutation\nof that thought process But you hopefully\n\n308\n00:16:02.107 --> 00:16:05.743\nhave a good sense of that based on our\nconversations up until this point.\n\n309\n00:16:05.743 --> 00:16:09.263\nAnd certainly I'm sure first hand\nknowledge of some of the things that you\n\n310\n00:16:09.263 --> 00:16:12.170\ndo on a regular basis\nassociated with this idea.\n\n311\n00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:16.690\nAnd if that's all we do, just a root down\nto the subordinate subordinate issues,\n\n312\n00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:17.710\nthen it's pretty straightforward.\n\n313\n00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:19.660\nIt's on the right hand side,\nand that's all we do.\n\n314\n00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:23.650\nNotice the root CA is\nlabeled as being offline.\n\n315\n00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:27.790\nAnd the root CA is labeled as being\noffline, thank you, appreciate that\n\n316\n00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:31.760\nlittle visual for us there Miss Cherokee,\nthat was perfect use of the cursor.\n\n317\n00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:36.621\nSo with the root CA being labeled offline,\nwhat we're looking at there is the fact\n\n318\n00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:39.933\nthat the root CA once it does\nissue certificates to one or\n\n319\n00:16:39.933 --> 00:16:43.263\nmore of these subordinate\nCAs will be stored securely.\n\n320\n00:16:43.263 --> 00:16:45.240\nWe've talked about this in prior episodes.\n\n321\n00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.890\nTaken offline literally,\n\n322\n00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:51.440\nstored securely in a way that does not\nallow a bad actor, I'm still thinking that\n\n323\n00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:55.060\nour stick figure guy down there is\nmasquerading as a threat actor.\n\n324\n00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:59.255\nSo our bad actor, who may or may not be in\nthis diagram, but that threat actor will\n\n325\n00:16:59.255 --> 00:17:03.142\nnot be able to get into that root CA,\nbecause it's not available, at least\n\n326\n00:17:03.142 --> 00:17:07.181\nnot with a significant amount of effort\nanyway, will not be able to get to it.\n\n327\n00:17:07.181 --> 00:17:09.935\nAnd because of that it is\nconsidered to be more secure.\n\n328\n00:17:09.935 --> 00:17:14.072\nBecause if we left the root CA online,\nand we allowed it to be available and\n\n329\n00:17:14.072 --> 00:17:18.752\npotentially just in business issuing\ncertificates with the appropriate requests\n\n330\n00:17:18.752 --> 00:17:22.294\nbeing made and that appropriate\ncredentials being provided,\n\n331\n00:17:22.294 --> 00:17:26.012\nwe've given the a hacker a bad actor,\na significant advantage.\n\n332\n00:17:26.012 --> 00:17:29.140\nBecause now if they can\nget to the root CA,\n\n333\n00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.180\nthey may very well be able\nto get a certificate.\n\n334\n00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:35.207\nBut with it offline, traditionally\ntaken apart, let's pretend for\n\n335\n00:17:35.207 --> 00:17:38.082\njust a minute that this is our hard drive,\nright.\n\n336\n00:17:38.082 --> 00:17:42.350\nIt's a USB stick, but pretend this\nis the hard drive of the root CA.\n\n337\n00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:46.610\nIf we would take this out of the machine\nthat represents the root CA or\n\n338\n00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:49.440\nif it's a virtual machine,\ncuz we do this in virtual machines today,\n\n339\n00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:54.380\nunbind the VMDK file or the VHDX file or\nwhatever the hard drive\n\n340\n00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:58.362\nrepresents itself as based on the vendor\nthat we're using to virtualize.\n\n341\n00:17:58.362 --> 00:17:59.524\nIf we take that and\n\n342\n00:17:59.524 --> 00:18:04.180\nwe store it somewhere physically\nseparate from the actual interface.\n\n343\n00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:07.649\nWhether it's in a vault, whether it's\nin a secure hard drive somewhere,\n\n344\n00:18:07.649 --> 00:18:08.490\nwho knows what.\n\n345\n00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:11.270\nBut whatever we do with it,\nwe separate them out so\n\n346\n00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:15.310\nthat somebody can't just power the machine\non and off we go, they've gotta actually\n\n347\n00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:19.670\ngo unlock the vault, get the hard drive,\nplug it in, and then power on the machine.\n\n348\n00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:24.179\nWe could add these layers of complexity in\nterms of overlapping mutually reinforcing\n\n349\n00:18:24.179 --> 00:18:27.685\nlevels of controls, commonly called\ndefense in depth when we talk\n\n350\n00:18:27.685 --> 00:18:30.840\nabout it from an architecture perspective,\nright?\n\n351\n00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.265\nAnd if we do that,\nthis adds not only complexity,\n\n352\n00:18:34.265 --> 00:18:39.171\nbut most importantly, adds security\nto our overall thought process.\n\n353\n00:18:39.171 --> 00:18:41.460\nAnd we want to equate those terms,\nby the way.\n\n354\n00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:45.180\nA lot of times people get a little\nuptight about that whole conversation.\n\n355\n00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:46.280\nIt's too complex.\n\n356\n00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.090\nThat means that we can't do it.\n\n357\n00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:50.520\nWell, no, complexity is not a bad thing.\n\n358\n00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:53.376\nComplexity in many cases can\nmean it's more difficult, and\n\n359\n00:18:53.376 --> 00:18:55.114\nyou've gotta be prepared for that.\n\n360\n00:18:55.114 --> 00:18:57.656\nBut that's why you need\nto step up your game, and\n\n361\n00:18:57.656 --> 00:19:01.624\nmake sure you understand how to do these\nthings as a security professional,\n\n362\n00:19:01.624 --> 00:19:03.750\nas a certified encryption specialist.\n\n363\n00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:09.280\nBut complexity, if handled correctly,\nif implemented properly equals,\n\n364\n00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:14.170\nnot in every case, but in many cases,\nif done correctly equals more security.\n\n365\n00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:16.510\nAnd we have to be willing\nto understand that.\n\n366\n00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:20.137\nI'm not suggesting that every time\nwe make something more complex,\n\n367\n00:19:20.137 --> 00:19:21.460\nit becomes more secure.\n\n368\n00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:25.440\nYou can be incredibly secure\nwith a very simple architecture.\n\n369\n00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.220\nI'm not suggesting that\nthat's not the case,\n\n370\n00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:32.335\nI just wanna point out that as we\nadd layers of controls to overlap,\n\n371\n00:19:32.335 --> 00:19:38.050\nmutually reinforce, and counteract other\nissues, we do tend to add complexity.\n\n372\n00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:40.839\nBut we are also adding security\nif we do it correctly.\n\n373\n00:19:40.839 --> 00:19:44.645\nAnd this is a thought process that\nyou have to wrap your head around\n\n374\n00:19:44.645 --> 00:19:48.655\nIn the real world and understand how\nto bring to the table and deploy to\n\n375\n00:19:48.655 --> 00:19:53.640\nthe benefit of your customer and deploy\nto the benefit of your organization.\n\n376\n00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.470\nBecause if you can embrace this idea,\n\n377\n00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:58.730\nyou're gonna be better\noverall what at you do.\n\n378\n00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:03.150\nYour security will be overall\nbetter within your organization.\n\n379\n00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:08.140\nAnd you will be able to withstand more\nattacks over a longer period of time\n\n380\n00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:12.550\nsuccessfully as a result of creating\narchitectures that are more robust.\n\n381\n00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:14.884\nThis is just the nature of\nwhat we do every day, yes?\n\n382\n00:20:14.884 --> 00:20:16.644\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nif we think about that concept, Adam, and\n\n383\n00:20:16.644 --> 00:20:18.175\nyou were talking about in real life.\n\n384\n00:20:18.175 --> 00:20:22.084\nMaybe if I was using something\nlike an m-of-n control,\n\n385\n00:20:22.084 --> 00:20:26.890\nstating have to have two of the five\nof my IT staffers present in order to\n\n386\n00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:31.442\nobtain that VHD file or VHGX or\nwhatever versions you had said.\n\n387\n00:20:31.442 --> 00:20:33.952\nSo maybe I store it in\na safety deposit box and\n\n388\n00:20:33.952 --> 00:20:36.562\nI give you the key to\nthe safety deposit box, but\n\n389\n00:20:36.562 --> 00:20:40.312\nsomeone else on the team the password for\nthat encrypted hard drive.\n\n390\n00:20:40.312 --> 00:20:45.098\nSo then both people have to be present so\nAdam can't go in and\n\n391\n00:20:45.098 --> 00:20:47.895\nchange a few things all on his own.\n\n392\n00:20:47.895 --> 00:20:50.747\nIt would have to kind of be a joint effort\nin getting two people on board to do\n\n393\n00:20:50.747 --> 00:20:51.391\nsomething bad.\n\n394\n00:20:51.391 --> 00:20:52.891\nMaybe a little more difficult.\n\n395\n00:20:52.891 --> 00:20:56.901\nIt is, it's a little more complicated, but\nyou're getting that additional security.\n\n396\n00:20:57.921 --> 00:21:01.571\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a great example of one\nway we could implement that, right.\n\n397\n00:21:01.571 --> 00:21:03.325\nSplitting up as you suggest.\n\n398\n00:21:03.325 --> 00:21:05.520\nAnd we're bringing in a couple\nof key concepts here.\n\n399\n00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.670\nYou call that m-of-n in terms of\nthe thought process around the controls.\n\n400\n00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:12.035\nBut let's actually define\nspecifically what that breaks into.\n\n401\n00:21:12.035 --> 00:21:16.270\nCuz you described some really important\nconcepts architecturally that we build on.\n\n402\n00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:18.300\nYou described separation of duties.\n\n403\n00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:20.100\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; As part of what you were describing,\n\n404\n00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:21.768\nas one or more of the controls.\n\n405\n00:21:21.768 --> 00:21:27.860\nYou also described what we would call\neither a two person or a two key solution.\n\n406\n00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:30.920\nYou hear it referred to differently\ntraditionally depending on whether you\n\n407\n00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.071\ncome from a more military,\ngovernment background or\n\n408\n00:21:33.071 --> 00:21:34.780\na more private sector background.\n\n409\n00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:39.270\nBut the two person rule, which is\na established methodology as well,\n\n410\n00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:40.642\nis another element of what you describe.\n\n411\n00:21:40.642 --> 00:21:43.550\nWe would need more than\none person involved and\n\n412\n00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:46.490\nmultiple levels of\nauthentication occurring\n\n413\n00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:49.190\nto be able to essentially access or\nunlock the hard drive, right.\n\n414\n00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:53.579\nAnd so when we bring all that together,\nit's a great way of thinking through\n\n415\n00:21:53.579 --> 00:21:57.694\nthe complexity issue I was discussing,\nbut also the desired outcome,\n\n416\n00:21:57.694 --> 00:22:02.358\nwhich as you rightly identified, would\nbe a much more secure implementation for\n\n417\n00:22:02.358 --> 00:22:04.853\nus to be able to control or\nseek to control.\n\n418\n00:22:04.853 --> 00:22:09.015\nAnd not only seek to control, but also\naudit and verify and validate the actual\n\n419\n00:22:09.015 --> 00:22:13.780\nproper use of, which are other things that\nyou called out as part of that as well.\n\n420\n00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:18.050\nAuditing or a audit trail, a verification\nand validation thought process, so\n\n421\n00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:22.420\nthat if we do use the hard drive,\nwe have an authoritative chain and\n\n422\n00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:25.088\nwe can specify who did it and\nunder what conditions.\n\n423\n00:22:25.088 --> 00:22:28.600\nSo that would be a great opportunity for\nus to build in all those layers.\n\n424\n00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:32.620\nBut then also make sure that because all\nthose things hopefully are firing off\n\n425\n00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:34.130\nin the right sequence together, right?\n\n426\n00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:36.280\nIf we are doing it the right way,\n\n427\n00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.380\nevery one of them reinforces\nthe one that went before.\n\n428\n00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:43.120\nAnd if we drop out anywhere along\nthe chain there, because maybe some or\n\n429\n00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.910\nmore of those controls can't be met,\nright?\n\n430\n00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:48.250\nIt's not me or it's not you or\nI don't have the right key or\n\n431\n00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:51.710\nyou don't or we're not in the right place\nat the right time doing the things and\n\n432\n00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:54.150\nthe sequence we need to do to access it.\n\n433\n00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:56.520\nWe hopefully stop\nsomebody from getting in.\n\n434\n00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:59.248\nAnd that's the exact thing that\nwe want with defense in depth.\n\n435\n00:22:59.248 --> 00:23:03.144\nWe don't expect that every layer of\nthe multiple layers that overlap\n\n436\n00:23:03.144 --> 00:23:06.110\neach other are gonna be able\nto withstand an attack.\n\n437\n00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:06.750\nQuite the opposite,\n\n438\n00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:11.410\nwe assume many of them will fold and will\nbuckle under the pressure of an attack.\n\n439\n00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:15.610\nWhat we're looking for is the ability\nto stack enough layers together, right,\n\n440\n00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:19.470\none before the other, so\nwe can absorb the attack and stop it\n\n441\n00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:23.590\nbefore it does reach the hard drive in\nour case or whatever we're talking about.\n\n442\n00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:27.120\nAnd the goal is not to defend\nthe outermost perimeter layer, but\n\n443\n00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.560\nrather defend the innermost\nsecure sanctum.\n\n444\n00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:34.804\nAnd if we can stop the attack somewhere\nalong that line, we've been successful.\n\n445\n00:23:34.804 --> 00:23:37.530\nAnd that's the thing that you have to wrap\nyour head around and really understand.\n\n446\n00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:40.762\nThink about literally a target, a\nbulls-eye, with multiple layers of rings,\n\n447\n00:23:40.762 --> 00:23:44.101\na dartboard's a good example of this, if\nyou have a visual for any of those things.\n\n448\n00:23:44.101 --> 00:23:48.597\nYou know, it's not about getting the right\namount of rings, either standing up or\n\n449\n00:23:48.597 --> 00:23:52.002\nfalling down, it's about having so\nmany layers between us and\n\n450\n00:23:52.002 --> 00:23:56.500\nthe outside attacker that it's unlikely\nthey're gonna get through all of them and\n\n451\n00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:59.454\nget to that bullseye,\nwhatever that is in the center,\n\n452\n00:23:59.454 --> 00:24:02.694\nthe hard drive in our case or\nwhatever you were suggesting.\n\n453\n00:24:02.694 --> 00:24:06.262\nAnd preventing exposure of\nthe innermost protected ring.\n\n454\n00:24:06.262 --> 00:24:09.961\nIf we can do that, we're successful,\nand that's all we gotta worry about.\n\n455\n00:24:09.961 --> 00:24:13.009\nI don't care if you blow through\n10 of my 11 layers of protection,\n\n456\n00:24:13.009 --> 00:24:15.240\nas long as the 11th layer holds secure.\n\n457\n00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:18.170\nAnd the other thing a lot of people\noften misunderstand about defense and\n\n458\n00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:23.330\ndepth as a thought process, it's not\nabout, hey let's stop you at layer 2.\n\n459\n00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:26.610\nIt's about let's hopefully stop you\ncertainly don't get me wrong when I say\n\n460\n00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:29.290\nthat, but\nwhat I mean is it's not about hard stop.\n\n461\n00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:31.707\nIt may be about delaying\nyou long enough and\n\n462\n00:24:31.707 --> 00:24:34.731\nmaking you work hard enough\nthrough each layer that,\n\n463\n00:24:34.731 --> 00:24:38.649\nthe likelihood of us finding you,\nand detecting the attack goes up.\n\n464\n00:24:38.649 --> 00:24:44.620\nAnd goes up significantly the more time it\ntakes and the more delaying we can cause.\n\n465\n00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:46.400\nAnd it may be enough to simply say,\n\n466\n00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.930\nyou know what given another 30 minutes you\nwould have gotten all the way through.\n\n467\n00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:53.523\nBut before I delayed you long enough,\nI found you before you got in,\n\n468\n00:24:53.523 --> 00:24:56.740\nthat's still a success, and\nin our book that's still a win.\n\n469\n00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:59.700\nSo defencing depths is something\nwe really gotta fit in through and\n\n470\n00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:04.490\nlogically understand how to implement\nto your advantage as a defender.\n\n471\n00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:06.495\nBut to the detriment to the attacker,\n\n472\n00:25:06.495 --> 00:25:10.201\nbecause it may sometimes literally\nbe allowing them through a layer.\n\n473\n00:25:10.201 --> 00:25:14.942\nBut allowing them through but delaying\nthem long enough that, their monitoring or\n\n474\n00:25:14.942 --> 00:25:17.720\ndetective controls may actually kick in.\n\n475\n00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:21.400\nAnd you may be able to actually\nthen find the attacker,\n\n476\n00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:24.660\ntrace back the attacker at least\nprevent the attack through\n\n477\n00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:28.190\napplication of other controls that will\nmodify the interface in real time.\n\n478\n00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:30.300\nThinking about something like an IPS here,\nright so\n\n479\n00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.280\nmaybe of intrusion preventions system.\n\n480\n00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:35.730\nWe can modify interfaces, cut off access,\n\n481\n00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:38.970\nwhatever the case may be that's\ngonna get us to where we need to be.\n\n482\n00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:42.087\nSo its a great way of thinking about it,\nlike the M event concept a lot, and\n\n483\n00:25:42.087 --> 00:25:44.867\nthe idea of being able to bring\nthose multiple layers of control.\n\n484\n00:25:44.867 --> 00:25:46.440\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; So real good example.\n\n485\n00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:50.104\nCan we go back up to the graphic,\njust because we want to compile it back.\n\n486\n00:25:50.104 --> 00:25:51.100\n&gt;&gt; I switched while you were talking.\n\n487\n00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:51.810\n&gt;&gt; You switched while we were?\n\n488\n00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:54.490\nCan we go back, because we've got to talk\nabout it, if you don't mind, no problem.\n\n489\n00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:56.350\nWe just gotta talk about\nthe RA piece off to the side,\n\n490\n00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:58.830\nwe didn't get a chance to really\ntalk about that in depth.\n\n491\n00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:03.180\nSo can we perhaps just zoom just\na wee bit, okay, great awesome.\n\n492\n00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:06.030\nSo just watch Cherokee adjust,\nadjust that for us there.\n\n493\n00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:09.880\nWe really did a pretty deep dive on\nthat thought process off to the right.\n\n494\n00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:10.750\nI just wanted to go back and\n\n495\n00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:13.210\njust bring in the whole\nregistration authority concept and\n\n496\n00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:16.470\njust talk through the logic of what that\nis, and why it may or may not be used.\n\n497\n00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:20.450\nSo off to the left what we\ncan see we have our root CA.\n\n498\n00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:24.140\nAnd again we have an issuing or\nsubordinate CA there at the second level.\n\n499\n00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:27.260\nAnd what we're seeing there is we\nhave a registration authority.\n\n500\n00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:32.480\nThe box that is labeled registration\nauthority right above it there is our box,\n\n501\n00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.000\nyeah that one right there thank you.\n\n502\n00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.168\nI was gonna go and move my mouse,\nbut then I'm like wait a second.\n\n503\n00:26:36.168 --> 00:26:37.139\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's on my machine.\n\n504\n00:26:37.139 --> 00:26:38.880\n&gt;&gt; I'm not controlling this diagram,\nit's on your machine.\n\n505\n00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:41.225\nSo with the registration authority,\n\n506\n00:26:41.225 --> 00:26:46.790\nwhat we have is we have another function\nthat may be assigned to a system in a PKI.\n\n507\n00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:50.809\nThis, again,\nmay be a separate standalone solution, so\n\n508\n00:26:50.809 --> 00:26:55.740\nit may stand outside of the traditional\nroot CA, subordinate CA role.\n\n509\n00:26:55.740 --> 00:27:00.327\nIf it is used and when it is, it acts and\nyou can see that the little stick figure,\n\n510\n00:27:00.327 --> 00:27:03.620\nthe male stick figure,\nI'm guessing down there.\n\n511\n00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:10.040\nThe nondescript one, right, so\nthat entity is asking or that user, right?\n\n512\n00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:11.810\nIs asking for certificates to be issued,\n\n513\n00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:14.720\nthat's what the error going up\nto the left is representing.\n\n514\n00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:18.580\nBut instead of going directly to\nsubordinate ca, they are going to\n\n515\n00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:22.730\nthe registration authority,\ntheir request is gonna be filed there.\n\n516\n00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:26.340\nThe registration authority and the LDAP\nprovider are talking to verify and\n\n517\n00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:30.010\nvalidate the authentication of\nthe credentials and whatever.\n\n518\n00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:34.260\nAnd then once the user hopefully is\nfound to be a legitimate user, then\n\n519\n00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:39.930\nthe registration authority sends a message\nover to the subordinate or issuing CA.\n\n520\n00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:43.740\nStick figure Bob is cleared for\na certificate, and\n\n521\n00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:46.920\nthen the subordinate issuing\nstate issues the certificate.\n\n522\n00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:51.220\nSo when we use the RA we're front\nloading the authentication and\n\n523\n00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:54.185\ninteraction process with what\nwe call in the [INAUDIBLE].\n\n524\n00:27:54.185 --> 00:27:56.275\nLanguage of PCAT would call it an entity,\n\n525\n00:27:56.275 --> 00:28:00.025\nif it's a computer it's a non-person\nentity, it's called an NPE.\n\n526\n00:28:00.025 --> 00:28:02.285\nIf it is a user it's\njust called an entity,\n\n527\n00:28:02.285 --> 00:28:05.425\nan entity is just a fancy term\nthat we use for the person or\n\n528\n00:28:05.425 --> 00:28:08.995\nthe entity, the thing that is\nrequesting the certificate, right.\n\n529\n00:28:08.995 --> 00:28:15.090\nSo a person entity and or a non-person\nentity, so whoever is asking for\n\n530\n00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:18.570\nthe certificates they will go\nthrough the RA if we break that out.\n\n531\n00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:22.460\nIf we don't we don't front load and\noff load that process, we have then go\n\n532\n00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:26.500\ndirectly to the subordinate CA, so it's\njust a matter of how we set that up right.\n\n533\n00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:29.670\nSo if we could go back,\ngo back to the one hierarchy,\n\n534\n00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:31.820\nno before we do that go\nback to one hierarchy.\n\n535\n00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:36.020\nJust remember here we have all of that\nhappening in just one system right.\n\n536\n00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:39.140\nSo everything there is taking\nplace where the user and\n\n537\n00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:43.570\nthe computer is talking to the root\nat initial CA, and that whole\n\n538\n00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:47.470\nconversation takes place inside one box\nand then they get their certificates.\n\n539\n00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:49.860\nWe didn't make those\nhours by directional but\n\n540\n00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:52.600\nwe are implying that of course it's\na two way conversation, right?\n\n541\n00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:57.220\nJust so you know, so two headed hours cost\nmore money, because we had an hour budget.\n\n542\n00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:58.315\n&gt;&gt; Short budget.\n\n543\n00:28:58.315 --> 00:29:00.420\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We couldn't make it work.\n\n544\n00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:05.040\nWe decided on a fourth diagram instead\nof extra arrowheads, call us silly, but\n\n545\n00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.240\nthat's what we did.\n\n546\n00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.190\nOkay so let's go to our third one,\n\n547\n00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:12.790\nthe third hierarchy that you have there,\nwe'll adjust that for just a second.\n\n548\n00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:15.159\nSo what we're going here is just\nblowing this out a little bit more,\n\n549\n00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:19.280\nadding in an additional\nlayer of hierarchy.\n\n550\n00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:22.500\nSo we have our root which is offline,\nare intermediate CA's,\n\n551\n00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:27.110\nwhich also are offline, and\nthen our issuing CA's which are online.\n\n552\n00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:31.152\nAnd the idea here would be that this is\nprobably a much larger company, this may\n\n553\n00:29:31.152 --> 00:29:35.330\nbe a global entity, may be operating in\nmultiple regions of the world in theory.\n\n554\n00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:40.334\nAnd so, think of Microsoft, think of\nGoogle, think of an Amazon, think of\n\n555\n00:29:40.334 --> 00:29:45.810\nCisco large large global companies,\nright, Boeing, huge huge company.\n\n556\n00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:50.330\nThis kind of companies that operate in\nmultiple countries perhaps are gonna own,\n\n557\n00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:55.020\nand in many cases they will own their own\ninternal certificate architecture and\n\n558\n00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:55.715\ninfrastructure.\n\n559\n00:29:55.715 --> 00:29:59.730\nThey'll have their own CA's,\nthey will have their own intermediate CAs\n\n560\n00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:04.220\nthat will issue subordinate CA\ncertificates, by region typically,\n\n561\n00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:08.190\nand then they'll bring those subordinate\nCAs online on the third tier.\n\n562\n00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:11.760\nSo you may see one for La Tom,\nfor the Latin American region,\n\n563\n00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:15.300\nyou may see one for Asia Pac for\nthe Asian Pacific theater.\n\n564\n00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:18.750\nYou may see one for\nthe Middle East and or Europe, right?\n\n565\n00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:20.950\nSo you will see a lot\nof times by region or\n\n566\n00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:26.380\nby geography that these issuing CAs are\nstood up and then these CAs will deal with\n\n567\n00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:31.380\ninfrastructure requests, user requests,\ncomputer requests at the local level.\n\n568\n00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:32.550\nAnd then, as a result,\n\n569\n00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:36.480\nwe have a breakdown of the certificate\nof hierarchy in such a way that we can\n\n570\n00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:41.560\nisolate those regional entities, and we\ncan further secure, further protect them.\n\n571\n00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:48.070\nIf somebody were to, in this scenario be\nable to get to an intermediate CA and\n\n572\n00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:52.670\nthe CR intermediate C in the left has\nissued certificates to issuing CAs.\n\n573\n00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:54.780\nIf they were able to\nget to that issuing or\n\n574\n00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:59.160\nintermediate CA at the second level,\nthey could potentially invalidate all\n\n575\n00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:01.990\nthe certificates that came\nfrom that intermediate CA.\n\n576\n00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:07.100\nSo the reason we take that offline as well\nright is that we want to, again, create\n\n577\n00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:12.140\nthis level of protection and isolation for\nthe top tiers of our hierarchy.\n\n578\n00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:17.470\nTo ensure that certificates being\nissued to other CAs are validated and\n\n579\n00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:21.290\nprotected and that they cannot,\nat least without tremendous effort,\n\n580\n00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:25.050\ncannot be invalidated or\ncannot be masqueraded or spoofed.\n\n581\n00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:28.770\nAnd this is a very important part of how\nwe think about this architecture, right?\n\n582\n00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:32.084\nSo, we see that there, we can see that's\ngoing on, we see we have a little server.\n\n583\n00:31:32.084 --> 00:31:35.962\nI guess off to the right there getting a\ncertificate directly from that issuing CA\n\n584\n00:31:35.962 --> 00:31:39.620\nand then we have some other computers\noff to the left along with users.\n\n585\n00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:43.330\nWe have one more diagram we\nwanna talk to you about as well,\n\n586\n00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:44.800\nthe web of trust, right?\n\n587\n00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.620\nSo this is our traditional mesh or\n\n588\n00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:49.550\nweb, Web-\n&gt;&gt; Topology.\n\n589\n00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:52.710\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, I was gonna say technology\nor terminology, I was looking for\n\n590\n00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:54.110\nthe topology word.\n\n591\n00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:58.610\nThis is why you must always have a team\nof people hosting and presenting because,\n\n592\n00:31:58.610 --> 00:32:00.600\none person will forget something and\n\n593\n00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:03.490\nthat other person is supposed to\nbe here to actually help them out.\n\n594\n00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:04.786\nSo high five, good job.\n\n595\n00:32:04.786 --> 00:32:08.493\nAll right, awesome, but we didn't get\nthat on camera, one more time over here.\n\n596\n00:32:08.493 --> 00:32:12.576\nI love that dissociated arm that comes out\nof the window out of nowhere sometimes, so\n\n597\n00:32:12.576 --> 00:32:13.279\nit's great.\n\n598\n00:32:13.279 --> 00:32:14.296\nAll right, so thank you very much.\n\n599\n00:32:14.296 --> 00:32:15.471\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI'm sure I'll hear about it later.\n\n600\n00:32:15.471 --> 00:32:16.961\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, you won't,\n\n601\n00:32:16.961 --> 00:32:19.390\nI make people do that all the time,\nit's okay.\n\n602\n00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:21.190\nSo what we are looking at here, right, and\n\n603\n00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:23.230\nthis is kind of\nan interesting one as well.\n\n604\n00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:25.760\nWe think of this almost like\na web as we said, or a mesh,\n\n605\n00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:26.980\nthat's what we would call it.\n\n606\n00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:32.240\nAnd the idea here is that every box on any\nof those connection points can talk to,\n\n607\n00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:37.230\ninteract with, communicate with, and\nultimately can extend trust and/or trust,\n\n608\n00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:39.580\nbe trusted by, any other one.\n\n609\n00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:43.476\nAnd so what we have is every box\nis connected to every other one in\n\n610\n00:32:43.476 --> 00:32:44.880\nan overlapping mesh.\n\n611\n00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:48.429\nAnd so if one of the connections were\nto somehow mysteriously disappear or be\n\n612\n00:32:48.429 --> 00:32:52.309\nbroken, we would still have the ability to\nreach another one of those boxes through\n\n613\n00:32:52.309 --> 00:32:56.319\nan alternate communication mechanism, or\nanother channel as we would say, right.\n\n614\n00:32:56.319 --> 00:32:59.847\nWe're not gonna remove one of those\narrows and still show you the path, but\n\n615\n00:32:59.847 --> 00:33:02.580\nyou get the general idea and\nwe certainly can do that.\n\n616\n00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:05.910\nIf you just imagine that one of\nthe vertical arrows either on the left or\n\n617\n00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:08.710\nthe right were removed,\nand then you trace back\n\n618\n00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:12.720\nfrom whatever box needs to connect\nto that box without that arrow.\n\n619\n00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:15.190\nYou could see that it's a two\nstep process at that point\n\n620\n00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:18.900\ninstead of a direct one step process, but\nwe can still get to where we need to be.\n\n621\n00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:22.300\n&gt;&gt; Maybe a little more practical\nin a lot of implementations if\n\n622\n00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:24.020\nthere's not a direct link to all of those.\n\n623\n00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:26.830\nAnd I've seen quite a bit in books that\n\n624\n00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:29.640\npeople will have\na certificate signing party.\n\n625\n00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:32.450\nAdam, have you ever been to one of\nthese certificate signing parties for\n\n626\n00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:33.680\nthis type of configuration?\n\n627\n00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:34.960\n&gt;&gt; A certificate signing party?\n\n628\n00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; What kind of\n\n629\n00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:38.080\nblack magic heresy is that?\n\n630\n00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:38.726\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n631\n00:33:38.726 --> 00:33:40.030\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I've never heard of\n\n632\n00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:41.560\na certificate signing party before.\n\n633\n00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:42.330\n&gt;&gt; Okay, just curious.\n\n634\n00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:44.250\n&gt;&gt; Is that like a west coast thing?\n\n635\n00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:46.280\n&gt;&gt; I've read it in several textbooks,\nyeah.\n\n636\n00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:50.361\n&gt;&gt; Textbooks written by reputable\npeople or by cartoon characters?\n\n637\n00:33:50.361 --> 00:33:51.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know,\n\n638\n00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.516\nI'm not saying that doesn't happen,\nI just, I've never been invited.\n\n639\n00:33:52.516 --> 00:33:54.810\n&gt;&gt; I've always wondered about that.\n\n640\n00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:56.022\nNo, nor have I, yeah.\n\n641\n00:33:56.022 --> 00:33:56.588\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I've never been invited\n\n642\n00:33:56.588 --> 00:33:57.109\nto a certificate party.\n\n643\n00:33:57.109 --> 00:33:59.326\nI've been invited to a lot\nof parties over the years,\n\n644\n00:33:59.326 --> 00:34:02.075\nnone of them have the words\ncertificate signing in front of them.\n\n645\n00:34:02.075 --> 00:34:03.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Had they had\n\n646\n00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:04.620\nthat I probably would not have attended.\n\n647\n00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:09.720\nSo I've never been a party, no pun\nintended, to a certificate signing party.\n\n648\n00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:14.443\nI would imagine, and please feel\nfree to correct me if I'm wrong, but\n\n649\n00:34:14.443 --> 00:34:19.661\nI would imagine that it, as you imply,\nhas to do with signing certificates.\n\n650\n00:34:19.661 --> 00:34:24.227\nI do know of processes where, all\nkidding aside, people will get together,\n\n651\n00:34:24.227 --> 00:34:27.108\ndo the issuance of\nthe certificates from a root or\n\n652\n00:34:27.108 --> 00:34:29.516\nintermediate out to the subordinates.\n\n653\n00:34:29.516 --> 00:34:34.123\nThat will be done in a very secure,\ncontrolled environment, and\n\n654\n00:34:34.123 --> 00:34:37.391\nthen those certificates are hand carried,\nor\n\n655\n00:34:37.391 --> 00:34:41.360\nsecurely transmitted to stand\nup the subordinate CAs.\n\n656\n00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.310\nI don't know if that's what we are now\ncalling a certificate signing party,\n\n657\n00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:45.450\nI'm not quite sure.\n\n658\n00:34:45.450 --> 00:34:49.740\nBut in all the years I've been doing this\nI've never been invited to a certificate\n\n659\n00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:53.680\nsigning party, so I can't speak\nknowledgeably to that kind of a party.\n\n660\n00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:58.434\nBut if there is one and it is something\nwe can go to, somebody send us a note,\n\n661\n00:34:58.434 --> 00:35:03.490\nlet us know, and Cherokee and I will\nshow up, and boy are we gonna have fun.\n\n662\n00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:04.811\nWe're gonna bring Bob and Alice with us,\n\n663\n00:35:04.811 --> 00:35:06.730\nthey know how to party\nlike there's no tomorrow.\n\n664\n00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:09.244\nSo we definitely will check into that,\nI've never heard of one though,\n\n665\n00:35:09.244 --> 00:35:10.410\nI don't know what that would be.\n\n666\n00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:14.441\nBut I do wanna quickly talk about OCSP and\nSCVP.\n\n667\n00:35:14.441 --> 00:35:16.162\nWe mentioned them-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because you have to have time for\n\n668\n00:35:16.162 --> 00:35:17.430\nyour hand stand, so yep.\n\n669\n00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:19.510\n&gt;&gt; I do have to have time for\nmy handstand.\n\n670\n00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:22.800\nAnd we ran out of time so I don't know\nif I'm gonna get to do one, shucks,\n\n671\n00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:25.360\nthat's just too, too unfortunate.\n\n672\n00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:28.410\nBut let's talk quickly about OCSP and\nSCVP.\n\n673\n00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:31.430\nWe talked about the idea of CRL,\ncertificate revocation list, right.\n\n674\n00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:34.003\nAnd the idea that if we go\nto a certificate server,\n\n675\n00:35:34.003 --> 00:35:38.295\na certificate authority, and we see a list\nof certificates that have been issued,\n\n676\n00:35:38.295 --> 00:35:40.160\nwe can track this in the interface.\n\n677\n00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:43.070\nWe can see which certificates are out\nthere, what they're used for,\n\n678\n00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:45.881\nhow long they're valid for,\nall the standard stuff we went through\n\n679\n00:35:45.881 --> 00:35:48.940\nwith you in the prior episode where\nwe talked about certificates.\n\n680\n00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:51.600\nIf somebody gets up to no good, or\nsomebody doesn't pay their bill,\n\n681\n00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:55.170\nor somebody breaks the rules or\ndoes something silly,\n\n682\n00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:58.540\ngoes to a certificate party,\nhas too many certificates to drink and\n\n683\n00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:00.930\nall of a sudden it gets out of control,\nwhatever that may be.\n\n684\n00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:02.550\nYou didn't catch that,\nyou weren't paying attention,\n\n685\n00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:04.398\nI did the whole joke about\nthe certificate party thing.\n\n686\n00:36:04.398 --> 00:36:06.058\n&gt;&gt; I heard you.\n&gt;&gt; So, you didn't hear me, you weren't-\n\n687\n00:36:06.058 --> 00:36:07.280\n&gt;&gt; We're not getting out of control\n\n688\n00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:07.797\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n689\n00:36:07.797 --> 00:36:11.085\nif something like that happens then\nwe may, as the owner of the CA,\n\n690\n00:36:11.085 --> 00:36:14.869\nhave the right and indeed we do have\nthe right, to revoke that certificate.\n\n691\n00:36:14.869 --> 00:36:17.534\nWe create what's known as a CRL,\ncertificate revocation list,\n\n692\n00:36:17.534 --> 00:36:20.010\nessentially a list of certificates\nthat have been revoked.\n\n693\n00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:24.068\nIt is published by the CA that owns\nthe certificate in question, so\n\n694\n00:36:24.068 --> 00:36:27.780\nevery CA publishes their own\ncertificate revocation list.\n\n695\n00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:30.190\nBut as I mentioned,\nwe can do this a few different ways.\n\n696\n00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:34.970\nHistorically, old school, you would\ndownload this as a document, a text file.\n\n697\n00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:37.010\nAnd you would then have\nto go through it and\n\n698\n00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:40.340\nhave either a piece of software\nthat parses it looking for good or\n\n699\n00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:44.200\nbad certificates, or you would have\nto manually review it yourself.\n\n700\n00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:47.770\nEffective, but a little time intensive and\nnot the easiest way to do it.\n\n701\n00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:50.990\nSo along comes online\ncertificate status protocol, and\n\n702\n00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:53.350\nserver based certificate\nvalidation protocol.\n\n703\n00:36:53.350 --> 00:36:55.040\nOCSP is real time protocol,\n\n704\n00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:58.880\nit lets us verify certificates through\na software interface, traditionally.\n\n705\n00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:03.720\nSo we can check in real time against\nthe CA and see whether or not that\n\n706\n00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:07.307\ncertificate is valid, is available,\nis online, has not been revoked.\n\n707\n00:37:07.307 --> 00:37:11.360\nCertificate based certificate validation,\nor server based certificate validation\n\n708\n00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:17.850\nprotocol, SCVP, I'd mentioned RFC 5055,\nit is referenced there,\n\n709\n00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:22.610\nit is the RFC that creates, and stands up,\nand establishes the framework for this.\n\n710\n00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:24.230\nIt is an Internet protocol, so\n\n711\n00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:28.970\nyou can look up RFC 5055, read up on it\nif you have not heard about it before.\n\n712\n00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:32.670\nBut this determines the path between\nthe X.509 digital certificate and\n\n713\n00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:34.140\nthe trusted root.\n\n714\n00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:36.290\nWe call this delegated path discovery,\n\n715\n00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:39.980\nand the validation of that path\ndelegated path validation.\n\n716\n00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:46.980\nSo DPD for delegated path discovery and\nDPV, delegated path validation,\n\n717\n00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:51.320\naccording to a standardized validation\npolicy that's applied at the CA.\n\n718\n00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:54.680\nThe reason this is important, and\nI showed you this in the last episode\n\n719\n00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:57.488\nwhere we looked at in the certificate\nitself the details so\n\n720\n00:37:57.488 --> 00:38:02.000\nwe looked at the certification path,\nis that we can walk backwards up that path\n\n721\n00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.450\nlooking at certificates and\nchecking the validity of each one\n\n722\n00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:09.020\nto ensure that we are getting\ncertificates from a valid source.\n\n723\n00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:13.584\nSo SCVP is critical to allow us to\ndo that, and it's based on an ROC\n\n724\n00:38:13.584 --> 00:38:18.738\nstandard which allows us to implement\nthat protocol the same way everywhere,\n\n725\n00:38:18.738 --> 00:38:21.700\nand make sure that it works the same\nway everywhere that it is used,\n\n726\n00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:24.920\nwhich is a very important concept for\nus as well.\n\n727\n00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:28.520\n&gt;&gt; It looks like we're really out of time,\nbut you did have the classes that you\n\n728\n00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:29.638\nwanted to-\n&gt;&gt; No handstand?\n\n729\n00:38:29.638 --> 00:38:32.629\n&gt;&gt; So it's a toss up between\nthe classes of the certificates, or\n\n730\n00:38:32.629 --> 00:38:35.090\nthe handstand, what do you think, guys?\n\n731\n00:38:35.090 --> 00:38:35.775\n&gt;&gt; Should we vote?\n\n732\n00:38:35.775 --> 00:38:38.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Why don't you vote in real time and\n\n733\n00:38:38.730 --> 00:38:42.140\nthen we'll take those results and\ndo absolutely nothing with them.\n\n734\n00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:45.240\nCuz by the time you vote, we're not\ngonna be here to do the handstand.\n\n735\n00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.620\nSo all right, I'm gonna do a handstand for\nyou, are you ready?\n\n736\n00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:50.290\nCan we do, do we have a tabletop\ncamera that we can do?\n\n737\n00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:52.140\nAll right, so I'm gonna do a handstand,\nare you ready?\n\n738\n00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:53.310\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna do it on the table.\n\n739\n00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:53.890\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; This is\n\n740\n00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:54.910\ngonna be awesome, I'm gonna go-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n741\n00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:55.580\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go up in the air.\n\n742\n00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:56.410\n&gt;&gt; Should I stand back?\n\n743\n00:38:56.410 --> 00:38:57.550\n&gt;&gt; No, no, you stay right there.\n\n744\n00:38:57.550 --> 00:39:00.040\nI'm gonna go up in the air,\nI'm gonna flip over,\n\n745\n00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:02.010\nand then I'm gonna do a handstand\nright here on the table.\n\n746\n00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:02.850\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; You ready?\n\n747\n00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:04.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, close your eyes.\n\n748\n00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.270\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n&gt;&gt; All right, you ready?\n\n749\n00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:07.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, here we go, open your eyes.\n\n750\n00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:08.770\nOkay, watch handstand, you ready?\n\n751\n00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:09.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n752\n00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:11.910\n&gt;&gt; I'm standing on my hand.\n\n753\n00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:13.195\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Handstand, look.\n\n754\n00:39:13.195 --> 00:39:15.802\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I even did one with toes up.\n\n755\n00:39:15.802 --> 00:39:17.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Ta-da!\n\n756\n00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:17.986\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n757\n00:39:17.986 --> 00:39:18.850\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, okay so we voted-\n\n758\n00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:19.910\n&gt;&gt; Man of his word, right there.\n\n759\n00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:20.460\n&gt;&gt; You got the handstand.\n\n760\n00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:21.170\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there we go.\n\n761\n00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:25.450\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right, so\nwe will deal with certificate classes, and\n\n762\n00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:29.180\nwe will deal with all the other stuff,\nall the goodness that we still have to do.\n\n763\n00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:30.890\nBut that is gonna be-\n&gt;&gt; All right, we'll hold you to it.\n\n764\n00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:32.080\n&gt;&gt; I gotta rest after the handstand, so\n\n765\n00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:33.835\nwe're gonna have to come back,\ndo another episode.\n\n766\n00:39:33.835 --> 00:39:36.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, thank you ladies and\ngentlemen for hanging with us.\n\n767\n00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:40.590\nAnd like Adam said, we do have more\ninformation to cover, so stay tuned.\n\n768\n00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:44.590\nBut we're gonna go ahead and sign off for\nthis episode, remember I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n769\n00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:47.760\n&gt;&gt; I am Adam Gordon,\nhandstander extraordinaire.\n\n770\n00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:50.090\n&gt;&gt;

They also cover the different classes available through commercial CAs. Next, Cherokee and Adam discuss  different trust models. Additionally, they explore various authentication protocols. Adam spends a little extra time explaining Kerberos with a special movie theater analogy.",

00:00:12.090\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.450\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your ECES series,\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.041\nAnd this is actually a part three\nwhere we're gonna continue looking at\n\n6\n00:00:19.041 --> 00:00:20.257\napplications of cryptography.\n\n7\n00:00:20.257 --> 00:00:24.344\nJust as Adam had promised, we will be\npicking up with our certificate classes.\n\n8\n00:00:24.344 --> 00:00:26.220\nAnd who better to explain them?\n\n9\n00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.650\nWell, than the man, the legend himself,\nMr Adam Gordon, thank you for\n\n10\n00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.570\njoining us today.\n\n11\n00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.080\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome,\n\n12\n00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.372\nI was actually thinking you were\ngoing to explain certificate classes.\n\n13\n00:00:34.372 --> 00:00:37.004\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was so tired from that hand stand I\n\n14\n00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:40.892\nneed to rest my hands, I don't know\nif I could use it to explain so\n\n15\n00:00:40.892 --> 00:00:45.000\nI may have to be only unihand as\nopposed to bimodal here for a moment.\n\n16\n00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwe'll get you an ice pack [LAUGH].\n\n17\n00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.790\n&gt;&gt; All right so as long as I can\ntake a rest afterwards then we'll\n\n18\n00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:49.450\nprobably be okay.\n\n19\n00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.620\nSo glad to be back with you as always, and\n\n20\n00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.150\ncertainly always glad to be here with you,\nwith Cherokee.\n\n21\n00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.630\nWe're gonna continue talking about\ncertificates but from a slightly different\n\n22\n00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.460\nperspective, we're gonna broaden\nthat conversation out a little bit.\n\n23\n00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.728\nWe have talked about PKI,\nwe have shown you our stick fantastic,\n\n24\n00:01:06.728 --> 00:01:11.083\nstick fast magorical diagrams that\nCherokee put together for us.\n\n25\n00:01:11.083 --> 00:01:15.103\nWhat we thought we would do next,\nis circle back to a topic that Cherokee\n\n26\n00:01:15.103 --> 00:01:17.793\nactually brought up in\nthe very first episode.\n\n27\n00:01:17.793 --> 00:01:20.573\nAnd if you haven't seen it,\nI always encourage you to go back,\n\n28\n00:01:20.573 --> 00:01:23.196\ntake a look at that from a,\njust a continuity perspective,\n\n29\n00:01:23.196 --> 00:01:25.700\nwhen we have more than one\nepisode in the sequence.\n\n30\n00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.740\nHaving all of those together, kinda\nwatching, going through them understanding\n\n31\n00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.370\nthem in sequence,\nhelps you to keep up with where we are and\n\n32\n00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.760\nwhat we are doing just by building\nthat foundational knowledge.\n\n33\n00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.950\nBut in that episode, Cherokee was\nasking about it, we talked a little bit\n\n34\n00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.650\nabout it when she asked about,\nalthough we didn't specifically say, yeah,\n\n35\n00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.980\nthere are different\nclasses of certificates.\n\n36\n00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.050\nShe did call out the idea that there may\nbe different types of certificates that\n\n37\n00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.825\nwill get issued for different reasons.\n\n38\n00:01:48.825 --> 00:01:51.845\nAnd we explored that a little bit,\nwe thought it would be good to go back and\n\n39\n00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:54.188\nreally just formally call\nout the certificate classes,\n\n40\n00:01:54.188 --> 00:01:55.923\nexplain a little bit about what they are.\n\n41\n00:01:55.923 --> 00:02:00.290\nThere are commonly five classes that\nare defined, class one through class five.\n\n42\n00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.898\nSo it's a relatively simple numbering\nsystem, class one, class two,\n\n43\n00:02:03.898 --> 00:02:08.525\nclass three, class four, and surprising,\nalthough not unknown class five, right.\n\n44\n00:02:08.525 --> 00:02:10.075\nSo let's talk about what each one is,\n\n45\n00:02:10.075 --> 00:02:14.500\nclass one, these are general\ncertificates meant for individuals.\n\n46\n00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.130\nMyself, you, Cherokee, any of us could\nhave one or more class one certificates.\n\n47\n00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.180\nThey're usually used for email, so for\ndigitally signing and securing email.\n\n48\n00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.362\nClass two certificates for organizations\nwhere you have to prove identities.\n\n49\n00:02:26.362 --> 00:02:29.684\nSo if a company needs a certificate\nto validate their identity,\n\n50\n00:02:29.684 --> 00:02:32.339\nthey would typically get\na class two certificate.\n\n51\n00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:36.283\nWhen we are doing class three\ncertificates, these are for server and for\n\n52\n00:02:36.283 --> 00:02:38.298\nsoftware signing identification.\n\n53\n00:02:38.298 --> 00:02:41.748\nSo companies that are not just\nvalidating their identity, but\n\n54\n00:02:41.748 --> 00:02:46.045\nare looking to validate their product or\nauthorize use of a server with a secure\n\n55\n00:02:46.045 --> 00:02:50.426\ncommunication channel, would traditionally\nuse a class three certificate.\n\n56\n00:02:50.426 --> 00:02:54.736\nThink, web servers think\nMicrosoft signing their code and\n\n57\n00:02:54.736 --> 00:02:57.070\nusing a digital cert to do that.\n\n58\n00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.038\nThese will be examples,\nright, of class three.\n\n59\n00:03:00.038 --> 00:03:03.302\nClass four, online business\ntransactions between companies.\n\n60\n00:03:03.302 --> 00:03:07.959\nSo think about either edifact transactions\nif you're familiar with that with\n\n61\n00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.142\ne-commerce, processing of orders back and\nforce.\n\n62\n00:03:11.142 --> 00:03:15.152\nE-commerce in general, so if we\nare using an electronic payment gateway,\n\n63\n00:03:15.152 --> 00:03:18.803\nneed a certificate to validate that,\nsomething along those lines.\n\n64\n00:03:18.803 --> 00:03:23.582\nAnd class five, for private organizations\nor governmental related security items,\n\n65\n00:03:23.582 --> 00:03:28.164\nthese would be things that are used where\none government agency is validating their\n\n66\n00:03:28.164 --> 00:03:32.240\ninternal network for another\ngovernment agency, something like that.\n\n67\n00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.270\nThey would use a class five certificate\nto do that at a higher level of security.\n\n68\n00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.580\nSo that's what we see, just as a general\nwalk through our standard classes.\n\n69\n00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.530\nYou could go to any commercial\ncertificate authority any commercial CA,\n\n70\n00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.400\nand you could read up on or\nfind out what kinds of classes or\n\n71\n00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.730\ncertificates they may make available.\n\n72\n00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.029\nIf you go to RSA, you've heard me mention\nThera sign with wait, there's many,\n\n73\n00:03:58.029 --> 00:03:59.309\nmany of them out there.\n\n74\n00:03:59.309 --> 00:04:02.964\nAll of them will have new information\ntypically on their website about services\n\n75\n00:04:02.964 --> 00:04:05.429\nthey offer, how much it costs,\nwhat the process is.\n\n76\n00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:08.330\nThey always have a FAQ of some kind,\nan F-A-Q.\n\n77\n00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.530\nAnd you can usually read up\non all that and find out.\n\n78\n00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.260\nAnd most of them,\n\n79\n00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.500\nalmost without exception,\nall commercial CAs, will offer multiple\n\n80\n00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.720\nclasses of certificates just depending\non what they do and how they do it.\n\n81\n00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.350\nYou may not be able to get a class\nfive certificate from everyone, but\n\n82\n00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.580\nyou can certainly get classes one through\nfour traditionally with no trouble.\n\n83\n00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.810\nSo, do you have a question?\n\n84\n00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:28.470\n&gt;&gt; No question.\n\n85\n00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.400\n&gt;&gt; You look like you may have\nthe question thing going on.\n\n86\n00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.197\n&gt;&gt; I may.\n&gt;&gt; It was the happy question face.\n\n87\n00:04:32.197 --> 00:04:35.105\nBut it was the misnomer,\nyou didn't have a question,\n\n88\n00:04:35.105 --> 00:04:37.340\ncuz you looked almost like you\nwere quizzical there for a second.\n\n89\n00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.120\nWe have this whole nonverbal communication\nlanguage thing that goes on when you're\n\n90\n00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.710\nonly looking at me Cherokee's\nholding up cue cards.\n\n91\n00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.700\nAnd she's like making noise, so that you\ndon't see it, but she's dancing around,\n\n92\n00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.130\nshe has like a whole headdress she puts on\nto get my attention, it's really crazy.\n\n93\n00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.060\nOne of these times we'll actually have to\nshow them when you're off camera doing\n\n94\n00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.910\nthat so they could see what goes\non when you're just looking at me.\n\n95\n00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.720\nWhen you look at me you think there's\nlike nothing going on, she's over there,\n\n96\n00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.270\nshe's got an easy chair she's having tea,\nshe's just kicking back.\n\n97\n00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You don’t see any of that, all right so\n\n98\n00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.240\nI misread that signal, I apologize, I\nthought she actually wanted to jump in or\n\n99\n00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.330\nsay something or\nhad a question there real quick.\n\n100\n00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.945\nSo we also,\nalong with certificate classes,\n\n101\n00:05:13.945 --> 00:05:16.390\nwanna talk a bit about the certificate\nmanagement life cycle, right.\n\n102\n00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.730\nBecause, when we think about classes\nof certificate we think about\n\n103\n00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.700\nwhat certificates are issued for,\nwhat they're good for essentially,\n\n104\n00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.640\nwhat they're used for, but we have to also\ntalk about this concept of the life cycle.\n\n105\n00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.850\nCertificates from creation\nall the way through usage and\n\n106\n00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.110\nultimately through destruction or\nend of life.\n\n107\n00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.050\nWhat does that look like, and\nwhen we think about a life cycle\n\n108\n00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.660\nwe think about that entire cradle,\nthe grave thought process.\n\n109\n00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:40.930\nWe start with the set up and\n\n110\n00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.460\ninitialization phase, so\nhow are certificated gonna be created,\n\n111\n00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.210\nwhat are we gonna do that allows\nus to request them securely?\n\n112\n00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.450\nHow do we validate an authorized\nour request and prove who we are?\n\n113\n00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:57.140\nHow do we generate the necessary moving\nparts, the key pairs for instance for\n\n114\n00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.770\nthe certificate?\n\n115\n00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.964\nHow do we generate\nthe certificate itself and\n\n116\n00:05:59.964 --> 00:06:02.420\nor how do we disseminate the certificate,\nright?\n\n117\n00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.045\nThese are all the moving parts,\nI'm not gonna let you ask a question now.\n\n118\n00:06:05.045 --> 00:06:06.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I gave you that chance,\n\n119\n00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:07.810\nyou fooled me last time,\n\n120\n00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.020\nI'm thinking you're not really\nwanting to ask a question.\n\n121\n00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.640\nI'm gonna keep going.\n\n122\n00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.350\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right.\n\n123\n00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:12.280\n&gt;&gt; All right, now I'm gonna stop,\n\n124\n00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.590\nso Cherokee is out, does wanna say\nsomething, or ask a question real quick.\n\n125\n00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.030\nSo what is it that you wanna throw out?\n\n126\n00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.550\n&gt;&gt; It's not too significant,\nI just wanted to say that the things I do\n\n127\n00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.870\nthink about when you're saying\nthese are little off the wall.\n\n128\n00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.190\nSo I try to refrain sometimes, Adam,\nbecause when we think about that\n\n129\n00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.600\ncertificate life cycle, the first thing\nthat comes to mind is The Lion King.\n\n130\n00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.330\nDo you remember the circle of life?\n\n131\n00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:31.870\n&gt;&gt; Mufasa.\n\n132\n00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:32.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n133\n00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.960\n&gt;&gt; Circle of life, love it.\n\n134\n00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:34.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n135\n00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.300\n&gt;&gt; I went to see it,\n\n136\n00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.750\nwe took the kids to see it-\n&gt;&gt; On Broadway?\n\n137\n00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.240\n&gt;&gt; Well not on Broadway, but\nwhen they traveled around, we saw it.\n\n138\n00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But yeah, we went to\n\n139\n00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.330\nsee it down in Miami at the big\ntheater down there, took the kids.\n\n140\n00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.850\nIt was a lot of fun, but\nmy mom got the tickets, and so\n\n141\n00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.820\nwe sat up in the balcony,\nand so, my girls go.\n\n142\n00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.120\nAnd I have two girls, you may or\n\n143\n00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.480\nmay not have heard me talk\nabout them in some other shows.\n\n144\n00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.770\nBut one of them is a slightly\nolder teenager than the other one.\n\n145\n00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.030\nThey're separated by three and a half\nyears, so at the time, they were probably,\n\n146\n00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.050\nI don't know,\nabout maybe 14 my oldest one.\n\n147\n00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:12.020\nSo maybe about 10 almost 11 for\nmy little one and so we take them both and\n\n148\n00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:15.000\nmy little one i,s, we're sitting up in\nthe balcony, we're kinda high up and\n\n149\n00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.335\nhave to look down and\nwe do this whole thing, it's phenomenal.\n\n150\n00:07:18.335 --> 00:07:19.825\nAnd she had been so excited about going,\n\n151\n00:07:19.825 --> 00:07:22.695\nthis is was like, all her idea,\nshe told my mom, her grandmother.\n\n152\n00:07:22.695 --> 00:07:26.545\nI wanna go see it, grandma gets\nthe tickets, we go, we get done and\n\n153\n00:07:26.545 --> 00:07:30.035\nshe turns to my wife and\nshe says, that was awesome, but\n\n154\n00:07:30.035 --> 00:07:31.740\nI couldn't see anything the whole time.\n\n155\n00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.610\nI don't know what, I all I saw were,\ncuz we were high enough up and\n\n156\n00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.790\nthere was somebody in the wayand it was,\nso she couldn't really see.\n\n157\n00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.130\nSo it was, we wound up having\nto do a redo, and do over.\n\n158\n00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:41.096\n&gt;&gt; It sounded nice yeah.\n\n159\n00:07:41.096 --> 00:07:41.890\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n160\n00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:44.600\nit was the redo on the Circle of Life.\n\n161\n00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.705\nBut yeah, you could think of that,\nthat would be one way of thinking of it.\n\n162\n00:07:47.705 --> 00:07:49.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This was our random aside,\n\n163\n00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.480\nbrought to you by Cherokee Boose.\n\n164\n00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.380\nIn case you had missed that, that was\nour random aside for this episode.\n\n165\n00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.580\nCan we un-random and continue on?\n\n166\n00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:59.337\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Are you sure?\n\n167\n00:07:59.337 --> 00:08:00.047\n&gt;&gt; As long as I keep\nthose thoughts to myself.\n\n168\n00:08:00.047 --> 00:08:00.605\n&gt;&gt; Are you good?\nOkay,\n\n169\n00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:03.809\nall right, no, no, continue to share\nthem with us cuz I know I love them,\n\n170\n00:08:03.809 --> 00:08:06.935\nI know the people out there That we\nare talking with, love them as well.\n\n171\n00:08:06.935 --> 00:08:10.171\nIt gives them an opportunity\nto interact with us,\n\n172\n00:08:10.171 --> 00:08:13.109\nto see what your thought\nprocess may be like.\n\n173\n00:08:13.109 --> 00:08:15.359\nPerhaps take a break, get up,\nget something to drink, come on back.\n\n174\n00:08:15.359 --> 00:08:17.707\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then we get back to business.\n\n175\n00:08:17.707 --> 00:08:18.587\n&gt;&gt; So here we are.\n\n176\n00:08:18.587 --> 00:08:21.718\nBut, no.\nI do like the whole idea of the [SOUND]\n\n177\n00:08:21.718 --> 00:08:25.917\nthought process with regards\nto the circle of life.\n\n178\n00:08:25.917 --> 00:08:27.007\nIt's a good way of thinking about it.\n\n179\n00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:29.039\nI mean, a life cycle, in general, is that.\n\n180\n00:08:29.039 --> 00:08:31.392\nIt's some sort of cyclical\nprocess we go through.\n\n181\n00:08:31.392 --> 00:08:32.557\nAnd we do need to think about it.\n\n182\n00:08:32.557 --> 00:08:34.169\nHowever, we frame the conversation.\n\n183\n00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:35.685\nSo I think that's a good one.\n\n184\n00:08:35.685 --> 00:08:36.630\nI like that a lot.\n\n185\n00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:39.731\nWe'll call that\nthe Lion King Certificate Life Cycle.\n\n186\n00:08:39.731 --> 00:08:40.971\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n&gt;&gt; That's gonna be awesome.\n\n187\n00:08:40.971 --> 00:08:43.737\nAll right, so,\nphase two in the certificate life cycle.\n\n188\n00:08:43.737 --> 00:08:45.470\nWe talked about setup and initialization.\n\n189\n00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:46.428\nWhat about administration?\n\n190\n00:08:46.428 --> 00:08:50.024\nNow that we've, in theory, generated\nour certificates, disseminated them,\n\n191\n00:08:50.024 --> 00:08:50.921\ngot them out there.\n\n192\n00:08:50.921 --> 00:08:52.897\nHow do we actually then\nkeep track of them?\n\n193\n00:08:52.897 --> 00:08:54.351\nHow do we know who has them?\n\n194\n00:08:54.351 --> 00:08:55.551\nWhat they're used for?\n\n195\n00:08:55.551 --> 00:08:57.020\nHow long they're good for?\n\n196\n00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:58.357\nHow do we store the keys?\n\n197\n00:08:58.357 --> 00:08:59.402\nWhere do we store them?\n\n198\n00:08:59.402 --> 00:09:03.203\nSo things like key storage, retrieval and\nvalidation of the certificate, backup or\n\n199\n00:09:03.203 --> 00:09:05.841\nescrow, and, of course,\nrecovery of the certificate for\n\n200\n00:09:05.841 --> 00:09:07.880\nsome reason where a key\nneed to be recovered.\n\n201\n00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.709\nAll this would be considered part\nof an administration capability.\n\n202\n00:09:11.709 --> 00:09:14.452\nWhat about cancellation and\nthe history phase?\n\n203\n00:09:14.452 --> 00:09:16.593\nGenerically, when things go wrong, right?\n\n204\n00:09:16.593 --> 00:09:18.540\nWe've talked about revoking certificates.\n\n205\n00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.067\nSo, certificates can expire.\n\n206\n00:09:20.067 --> 00:09:21.542\nThey may have to be renewed.\n\n207\n00:09:21.542 --> 00:09:24.960\nThey may be revoked, suspended,\nand/or destroyed, right?\n\n208\n00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.180\nSo we have all those activities going on.\n\n209\n00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:29.530\nSo that's in our cancellation and\nhistory phase.\n\n210\n00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:34.860\nWe have to keep track of certificates\nissued even after they're no longer good.\n\n211\n00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:38.359\nWe have to know that they were issued,\nknow to who, for what period of time, and\n\n212\n00:09:38.359 --> 00:09:38.942\nto what end.\n\n213\n00:09:38.942 --> 00:09:41.590\nSo it's important to track that\nhistorically because you don't wanna\n\n214\n00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:44.281\nreissue a certificate to somebody\nthat hasn't paid their bill the first\n\n215\n00:09:44.281 --> 00:09:44.865\ntime, right?\n\n216\n00:09:44.865 --> 00:09:47.160\nThat would not always be a good thing.\n\n217\n00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.931\nSo, we wanna know who the bad people\nare that don't pay their bills, and\n\n218\n00:09:49.931 --> 00:09:51.351\nnot give them another certificate.\n\n219\n00:09:51.351 --> 00:09:53.132\nUpdating and patching vulnerabilities.\n\n220\n00:09:53.132 --> 00:09:55.240\nThis is also part of our life cycle.\n\n221\n00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:59.253\nWho is going to be the person documented\nthat can recover the certificate,\n\n222\n00:09:59.253 --> 00:10:01.740\nif necessarily, on behalf of the user?\n\n223\n00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:06.711\nWho is the recovery agent, is what we\nwould call it, who has that capability?\n\n224\n00:10:06.711 --> 00:10:09.649\nWhat are or where are the recovery agents?\n\n225\n00:10:09.649 --> 00:10:13.916\nWe need EFS, Encrypting File System\nrecovery agents in the Microsoft world.\n\n226\n00:10:13.916 --> 00:10:16.837\nWe'll talk a little bit about EFS and\nit's bigger brother,\n\n227\n00:10:16.837 --> 00:10:19.712\nnewer version Bitlocker coming\nup in an upcoming episode.\n\n228\n00:10:19.712 --> 00:10:21.999\nSo, we'll talk some more about that.\n\n229\n00:10:21.999 --> 00:10:24.489\nKey recovery, in general, is part of this.\n\n230\n00:10:24.489 --> 00:10:28.412\nAnd we have to think about the fact, and\nthis brings up something really important,\n\n231\n00:10:28.412 --> 00:10:31.894\ngenerically, at a higher level than\njust PKI and certificates that we talk\n\n232\n00:10:31.894 --> 00:10:34.934\nabout a lot with regards to security,\nwhich is documentation and\n\n233\n00:10:34.934 --> 00:10:38.283\nhow important documentation is,\noverall, to this thought process.\n\n234\n00:10:38.283 --> 00:10:42.069\nIf we don't have good documentation,\nif we don't know who the recovery and\n\n235\n00:10:42.069 --> 00:10:44.730\nescrow agents are,\nif we don't keep that up to date,\n\n236\n00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:48.008\nthen what happens when we show up and\nsay, I'd to recover my key.\n\n237\n00:10:48.008 --> 00:10:48.960\nI've lost it.\n\n238\n00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.060\nAnd we no longer have that ability,\nbecause the escrow agent or\n\n239\n00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:55.041\nthe key recovery function has\nbeen modified in some way, and\n\n240\n00:10:55.041 --> 00:10:58.569\nmaybe we're no longer listed as\nrecovery agent, when before we were?\n\n241\n00:10:58.569 --> 00:11:02.922\nSo, documenting this kinda stuff also\nbecomes very, very important for us.\n\n242\n00:11:02.922 --> 00:11:07.238\nSo, updating and keeping track of that,\nbut also patching vulnerabilities.\n\n243\n00:11:07.238 --> 00:11:09.736\nHave we updated\nthe underlying architecture?\n\n244\n00:11:09.736 --> 00:11:10.658\nThe infrastructure?\n\n245\n00:11:10.658 --> 00:11:11.924\nThe operating system?\n\n246\n00:11:11.924 --> 00:11:14.629\nThe servers?\nAll that stuff associated with this?\n\n247\n00:11:14.629 --> 00:11:17.299\nYou don't tend to get security\nvulnerabilities associated with\n\n248\n00:11:17.299 --> 00:11:18.278\ncertificates per say.\n\n249\n00:11:18.278 --> 00:11:21.634\nBut you do get security vulnerabilities\nassociated with the underlying\n\n250\n00:11:21.634 --> 00:11:23.732\ninfrastructure that issues certificates.\n\n251\n00:11:23.732 --> 00:11:26.672\nSo, keeping up to date with that,\ndoing our patch management and\n\n252\n00:11:26.672 --> 00:11:28.864\nvulnerabilities assessment, and therefore,\n\n253\n00:11:28.864 --> 00:11:31.919\npatching those things,\nalways very important for us to consider.\n\n254\n00:11:31.919 --> 00:11:34.162\nSo, that's just something that\nwe would wanna think about.\n\n255\n00:11:34.162 --> 00:11:38.704\nBut all those phases together would create\nthe circle of certificate life that we\n\n256\n00:11:38.704 --> 00:11:42.664\noften talk about, more commonly\ncalled the certificate life cycle.\n\n257\n00:11:42.664 --> 00:11:45.352\nSo we wanna make sure we're\nfamiliar with that and\n\n258\n00:11:45.352 --> 00:11:47.320\nmake sure we have a sense of that.\n\n259\n00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.596\nAll of you, any of you that are out\nthere listening to us that are gonna be\n\n260\n00:11:50.596 --> 00:11:54.364\ninterested in becoming ECES, EC-Council\nCertified Encryption Specialists,\n\n261\n00:11:54.364 --> 00:11:57.819\nyou're gonna wanna make sure you\nunderstand the certificate life cycle.\n\n262\n00:11:57.819 --> 00:12:01.749\nWill be very important for you to think\nabout that and just have a sense of that.\n\n263\n00:12:01.749 --> 00:12:04.919\nRemember, we've talked about trust\nmodels in our prior episode,\n\n264\n00:12:04.919 --> 00:12:08.431\nwent through the diagrams and\nshowed you the different authority models.\n\n265\n00:12:08.431 --> 00:12:11.785\nThe single authority,\nthe hierarchical trust, the web of trust.\n\n266\n00:12:11.785 --> 00:12:15.035\nJust reminding you about how\nthose things may get implemented.\n\n267\n00:12:15.035 --> 00:12:18.046\nAnd remember, the certificate\nlife cycle fits into that because\n\n268\n00:12:18.046 --> 00:12:20.674\nwhatever the model is,\nwe're issuing certificates and\n\n269\n00:12:20.674 --> 00:12:23.371\nmanaging them through that\nlifecycle according to that.\n\n270\n00:12:23.371 --> 00:12:24.019\nYes, ma'am?\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n271\n00:12:24.019 --> 00:12:26.758\nearlier in the previous episode,\nI don't remember.\n\n272\n00:12:26.758 --> 00:12:28.132\nIt was the word commercial.\n\n273\n00:12:28.132 --> 00:12:31.930\nAnd I said it was just a public,\na third-party CA.\n\n274\n00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:35.946\nBut a question that I've had a lot from\nstudents when it comes to those trust\n\n275\n00:12:35.946 --> 00:12:40.184\nmodels, Adam, would be, they say,\nI've heard this term federated trust.\n\n276\n00:12:40.184 --> 00:12:41.720\nWhat is a federated trust?\n\n277\n00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:45.058\nSo when we look at those,\njust kinda point that out.\n\n278\n00:12:45.058 --> 00:12:48.268\nIf you do hear that term federated trust,\nand I think we've covered this previously.\n\n279\n00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:52.985\nBut if you haven't watched that\nshow it just means, for instance,\n\n280\n00:12:52.985 --> 00:12:56.229\nif I'm trying to vouch for\nyou to Adam, okay?\n\n281\n00:12:56.229 --> 00:12:57.389\nAnd I say, you know what?\n\n282\n00:12:57.389 --> 00:12:57.980\nI know this person.\n\n283\n00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:59.009\nThey're a really great person.\n\n284\n00:12:59.009 --> 00:13:00.379\nAdam, you should really trust them.\n\n285\n00:13:00.379 --> 00:13:03.510\nSo then, indirectly, Adam trusts you.\n\n286\n00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:05.577\nAnd that would be a federated trust.\n\n287\n00:13:05.577 --> 00:13:09.552\nWhich, also, that's something you hear\nassociated with these types of trust\n\n288\n00:13:09.552 --> 00:13:11.699\nmodels, too, if you ever hear that term.\n\n289\n00:13:11.699 --> 00:13:13.308\n&gt;&gt; So we do hear federated trust.\n\n290\n00:13:13.308 --> 00:13:14.897\nWe also hear transitive trust.\n\n291\n00:13:14.897 --> 00:13:15.908\n&gt;&gt; Transitive as well, yes.\n\n292\n00:13:15.908 --> 00:13:19.000\n&gt;&gt; Transitive trust would be another model\nand theory, another way of describing it.\n\n293\n00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.560\nSo we often hear federated trust talked\nabout in terms of federation services,\n\n294\n00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:28.530\na broader thought process, a lot of times\nassociated with cloud capabilities today,\n\n295\n00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:31.137\ncloud deployments, things of that nature.\n\n296\n00:13:31.137 --> 00:13:36.451\nBut the idea federation, generically,\nis the idea of extending trust.\n\n297\n00:13:36.451 --> 00:13:38.386\nThat's the term we use,\nas you were describing.\n\n298\n00:13:38.386 --> 00:13:44.414\nExtending trust to\nan non-trusted third party.\n\n299\n00:13:44.414 --> 00:13:45.696\nNot a non trusted third-party.\n\n300\n00:13:45.696 --> 00:13:47.155\nProbably not the right\nway of describing that.\n\n301\n00:13:47.155 --> 00:13:51.396\nTo a unknown and, at this point, not\nincorporated inside of our circle of trust\n\n302\n00:13:51.396 --> 00:13:55.575\nparty, meaning, in plain old-fashioned\nEnglish, what we're saying is,\n\n303\n00:13:55.575 --> 00:13:58.838\nI have a business relationship,\nlike you were describing.\n\n304\n00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:02.525\nAnd two companies wanna be able to share\nresources and trust each other, but\n\n305\n00:14:02.525 --> 00:14:04.496\nthey don't have a formal association.\n\n306\n00:14:04.496 --> 00:14:07.149\nThey don't share a common LDAP directory.\n\n307\n00:14:07.149 --> 00:14:11.110\nThey don't have a way of interacting\nwith each other that way.\n\n308\n00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:17.060\nSo, we then extend the trust from one\ncompany to another through federation.\n\n309\n00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:20.050\nAnd so, federation allows us to\nbind those two entities together,\n\n310\n00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:23.130\nallow them to trust each other\nunder certain strict and\n\n311\n00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:27.270\ncontrolled conditions using policies and\ncertain things that go into that.\n\n312\n00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:31.290\nAnd as a result, we then can allow them\nto trust each other, share resources,\n\n313\n00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:34.760\ndo business together, process payments,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n314\n00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.150\nSo federation is certainly\nused in that respect.\n\n315\n00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:40.746\nTransitive trust, which is another\nthought process we hear about,\n\n316\n00:14:40.746 --> 00:14:43.544\ngenerically associated\nwith trust relationships.\n\n317\n00:14:43.544 --> 00:14:46.990\nNot necessarily associated\nwith certificates per say.\n\n318\n00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:51.129\nBut, the thought process of what\ntransitive trusts imply is directly\n\n319\n00:14:51.129 --> 00:14:54.440\nassociated with PKI in\na certificate infrastructure.\n\n320\n00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:58.777\nThe idea that if A trusts B, generically.\n\n321\n00:14:58.777 --> 00:15:04.607\nAnd if B trusts C, generically,\nas just three common entities.\n\n322\n00:15:04.607 --> 00:15:08.570\nBut A and\nC do not trust each other directly.\n\n323\n00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:13.241\nThen, because they both trust B, they can\nnow indirectly trust each other cuz they\n\n324\n00:15:13.241 --> 00:15:17.111\ninherit that trust from the common\nentity that you were describing,\n\n325\n00:15:17.111 --> 00:15:20.129\nwhat I will call B just in\nthat relationship, right?\n\n326\n00:15:20.129 --> 00:15:25.178\nSo, if you imagine a triangle for just\na minute, giving us a visual here, right?\n\n327\n00:15:25.178 --> 00:15:25.870\nYou're gonna help me out.\n\n328\n00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:26.762\nSo, put your arm over here.\n\n329\n00:15:26.762 --> 00:15:27.574\n&gt;&gt; Okay, okay.\n\n330\n00:15:27.574 --> 00:15:28.710\n&gt;&gt; So if we imagine a triangle, right?\n\n331\n00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:30.373\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And okay, well, no.\n\n332\n00:15:30.373 --> 00:15:33.258\nWe wanna see it the other way cuz\nwe wanna focus on the triangle.\n\n333\n00:15:33.258 --> 00:15:33.759\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n334\n00:15:33.759 --> 00:15:37.464\nwe're gonna call A the very\ntop of the triangle.\n\n335\n00:15:37.464 --> 00:15:39.231\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna call B the lower left-hand\n\n336\n00:15:39.231 --> 00:15:40.068\nside of the triangle.\n\n337\n00:15:40.068 --> 00:15:40.928\nYour left is fine.\n\n338\n00:15:40.928 --> 00:15:41.455\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n339\n00:15:41.455 --> 00:15:43.820\nthen we're gonna call C the lower\nright-hand side of the triangle, right?\n\n340\n00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:44.389\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n341\n00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:47.106\n&gt;&gt; So, because we can see that A and B.\n\n342\n00:15:47.106 --> 00:15:48.022\nSo, show me A and B for a second.\n\n343\n00:15:48.022 --> 00:15:48.791\n&gt;&gt; A and B.\n\n344\n00:15:48.791 --> 00:15:49.318\n&gt;&gt; A and B are gonna trust each other.\n\n345\n00:15:49.318 --> 00:15:55.264\nAnd B is not gonna be\nable to trust C directly.\n\n346\n00:15:55.264 --> 00:15:58.120\nWe're gonna drop the bottom out of\nthe triangle for just a second, right?\n\n347\n00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.722\nAnd what we're gonna see is that they\nboth have to go through A, up here,\n\n348\n00:16:01.722 --> 00:16:03.509\nright, in order to see each other.\n\n349\n00:16:03.509 --> 00:16:06.289\nSo now, if we wanna create\na transitive trust, right?\n\n350\n00:16:06.289 --> 00:16:09.572\nWe could say that because A and B, and\nB and C trust each other, but B and\n\n351\n00:16:09.572 --> 00:16:12.913\nC have no direct connection, We could\nsay that they both go through A and\n\n352\n00:16:12.913 --> 00:16:14.606\nas a result they inherit the trust.\n\n353\n00:16:14.606 --> 00:16:15.206\n&gt;&gt; I like it, yeah.\n\n354\n00:16:15.206 --> 00:16:17.529\n&gt;&gt; Right?\nAnd so that's what we're talking about.\n\n355\n00:16:17.529 --> 00:16:18.051\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n356\n00:16:18.051 --> 00:16:19.732\n&gt;&gt; Thank you,\nbecause you were the one who did\n\n357\n00:16:19.732 --> 00:16:20.780\nthe fine pointing-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n358\n00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.800\n&gt;&gt; And allowed us to understand all that.\n\n359\n00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.060\nAnd so as a result,\nwhen you talk about a trust transitivity,\n\n360\n00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:29.500\nthe extension of trust\nthrough the association.\n\n361\n00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:32.200\nAnd this is how we see the trust chain or\nthe hierarchy for\n\n362\n00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.540\ncertificates playing out.\n\n363\n00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:36.490\nBecause the root issues\na certificate to the subordinate and\n\n364\n00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:39.240\nthen the subordinate through,\nlet's say if it's an intermediate.\n\n365\n00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:43.870\nWe'll have a subordinate below it and\nso we have A, B, C down the chain and\n\n366\n00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:47.235\nthen issuer issues a certificates\nto the end use or computer.\n\n367\n00:16:47.235 --> 00:16:50.960\nWho can then trace that certificate\nall the way back up to the root and\n\n368\n00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:56.256\ntrust it because of that inheritance\nof trust all the way down the chain.\n\n369\n00:16:56.256 --> 00:16:59.086\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE].\n\n370\n00:16:59.086 --> 00:17:03.642\n&gt;&gt; So that's, awesome job, okay very good.\n\n371\n00:17:03.642 --> 00:17:08.580\nAll right, so lets continue talking\nabout some other things associated here\n\n372\n00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:13.310\nwithe the thought process just beyond\nthe mere issuance of certificates beyond\n\n373\n00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:17.020\nthe PKI infrastructure beyond\nthe certificate classes,\n\n374\n00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.440\nbeyond the life cycle,\nwe now have certificates.\n\n375\n00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.970\nWe've talked extensively\nabout how to use them.\n\n376\n00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:24.210\nBut what you now have to think about is,\nand remember, the theme for\n\n377\n00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.220\nthis entire series of episodes is.\n\n378\n00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:29.420\nThe application, or\napplications, of cryptography.\n\n379\n00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.780\nHow do we use cryptography\nin the real world?\n\n380\n00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:35.050\nTo actually start to achieve some of\nthese end results that we're looking for.\n\n381\n00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:35.980\nWhat are the building blocks?\n\n382\n00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:36.610\nWhat are the pieces?\n\n383\n00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:37.570\nWhat are the tools?\n\n384\n00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:40.175\nBut also how do we\nactually then implement.\n\n385\n00:17:40.175 --> 00:17:45.320\nSo, see certificates coming to bear and\n\n386\n00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:48.160\nbe used effectively to allow\nus to communicate securely.\n\n387\n00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:52.410\nWe need secure authentication protocols to\ndo this and so when I think about secure\n\n388\n00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:55.310\nauthentication protocols, Cherokee,\nwhen I ask you, I should say,\n\n389\n00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:58.660\nto think about them, what are some of\nthe protocols that may pop into your head?\n\n390\n00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.470\nWhat are some things that\nwill be on your list?\n\n391\n00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:04.250\nDefinitely Kerberos because we were\nworking on a diagram before the show.\n\n392\n00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:09.060\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so Kerberos is on the list for\ncertainly an authentication mechanism.\n\n393\n00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:09.780\n&gt;&gt; An authentication, yes.\n\n394\n00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:13.690\n&gt;&gt; That would be considered secured,\nbut on in of itself\n\n395\n00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:14.940\n&gt;&gt; Aside from curb roast, and\n\n396\n00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:18.290\nwe will talk about curb roast, but are\nthere some others maybe older ones that\n\n397\n00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:21.470\nmay or may not be considered useable or\nsecured today.\n\n398\n00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:24.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if we go back to my Dr Seuss\nthinking I always, I don't know why,\n\n399\n00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:29.830\nI think of path like hop on pop path\nlike an unsecure part of authentication,\n\n400\n00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:30.990\nI see that on your list here.\n\n401\n00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:33.080\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so we have pap we also\nhave something that is like.\n\n402\n00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:37.900\nIt's a little bit more secure, known as\nS PAP or Shiva PAP which improves on PAP.\n\n403\n00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:40.760\nProprietary may not have been used and\nyou may not now about it.\n\n404\n00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.850\nWe also have CHAP, an oldie but\na goody, most people are aware of\n\n405\n00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:48.570\nCHAP although a lot of them know it as MS\nCHAP, Microsoft's implementation of CHAP.\n\n406\n00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:53.580\nBut Microsoft essentially takes\nthe initial non-Microsoft\n\n407\n00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:55.900\nimplementation of CHAP, and modifies it.\n\n408\n00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.850\nWhich is how it becomes\nas popular as it does.\n\n409\n00:18:57.850 --> 00:18:59.830\nSo.\n&gt;&gt; And we should be using version two,\n\n410\n00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:00.840\nat least, for [INAUDIBLE].\n\n411\n00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.840\n&gt;&gt; MS- CHAP V2 is the more recent version.\n\n412\n00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:06.070\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nAnd is actually going away\n\n413\n00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:09.590\nin certain respects in some of\nthe newer implementations in Microsoft.\n\n414\n00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:13.880\nYeah, there's transformation that takes\nplace in our industry on an ongoing basis.\n\n415\n00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:17.000\nBut we think historically and\nperhaps into the current day for\n\n416\n00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:17.970\nauthentication protocols.\n\n417\n00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:20.900\nOne, I mention PAP,\npassword authentication protocol.\n\n418\n00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:22.650\nOldie and not a goody, right?\n\n419\n00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:23.860\nAs we often say.\n\n420\n00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.550\nWill transmit user names and\npasswords in the clear.\n\n421\n00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:31.350\nWhich is why it was so problematic,\nand really is not used much anymore.\n\n422\n00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:34.270\nBut surprisingly,\nwe tend to use it all the time.\n\n423\n00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:35.870\nWe just don't always realize it.\n\n424\n00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:42.040\nWhen we send and we use basic HTTP\nauthentication on a website, we actually\n\n425\n00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:46.080\nare using Papp to transmit usernames and\npasswords, but they're not encrypted.\n\n426\n00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.970\nAnd you may do this internally to\na website that's behind a firewall or\n\n427\n00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:52.790\nto test environment,\nwhere you set up a website.\n\n428\n00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:57.650\nIf you go into either IS or the Apache\nmanagement interface for the Apache\n\n429\n00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:02.170\nweb server on the Linux Unit site and\nyou have options to set up authentication.\n\n430\n00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:05.700\nIf you choose basic authentication, you\nare actually using Papp as the overlying\n\n431\n00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:10.010\nprotocol to transmit, so you may not think\nabout it, but pap still is out there.\n\n432\n00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:14.080\nMuch like the [INAUDIBLE] it just\nscampers and hides away in the shadows.\n\n433\n00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:16.730\nSo, we have Papp even though\nits not recommended and\n\n434\n00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:19.480\ncertainly not normally used,\n[INAUDIBLE] s dash pap, or\n\n435\n00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:23.970\ns pap as we call it is pap just with\nthe extension of encryption for\n\n436\n00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:27.460\npasswords and password transmission,\nuser name and password transmission.\n\n437\n00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:32.320\nSo secure path is which is what Shiva\nis often referred to as incorrectly.\n\n438\n00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:35.590\nBut is referred to that way is\nmerely path with encryption and\n\n439\n00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:38.780\nit's actually formally and\nproperly called Shiva Path.\n\n440\n00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:43.350\nSome proprietary protocol limitation\nthat was widely thought about,\n\n441\n00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:44.200\nwidely discussed.\n\n442\n00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.595\nBut not as widely developed and\n\n443\n00:20:45.595 --> 00:20:48.550\nimplemented.CHAP as we talked\nabout challenge handshake\n\n444\n00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:52.730\nauthentication protocol,\nthis is used very commonly today.\n\n445\n00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:55.920\nMost vendors have CHAP implementation,\nVM ware for\n\n446\n00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:00.760\ninstance uses it to authenticate their\nstorage connections out to their.\n\n447\n00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.953\nA solutions or\nat least on the SAN side anyway,\n\n448\n00:21:02.953 --> 00:21:06.430\nwe can use that to authenticate as\nan extra added layer of security.\n\n449\n00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:09.800\nMicrosoft supports it as we said, although\nsupported through the implementation\n\n450\n00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.760\nof their proprietary MS CHAP and\nMS CHAP v2.\n\n451\n00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:16.800\nBut CHAP allows us to calculate\na hash after the user logs in,\n\n452\n00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.650\nshares the hash with the client system.\n\n453\n00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:22.330\nWe then periodically validate the hash\nto ensure that nothing has changed.\n\n454\n00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:26.070\nThis is a basic integrity,\nbasic authentication thought process.\n\n455\n00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:28.390\nThe challenge part is just\nthe sending of the challenge and\n\n456\n00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:31.620\nthen the responding to ensure that we're\nstill using the same credential, and\n\n457\n00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:34.830\ntherefore essentially\nare the same user logged in.\n\n458\n00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:37.420\nIf we ask you to provide your\npassword every 30 minutes and\n\n459\n00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:41.850\nthe hatch comes back consistently\nthe same, we know it's In theory,\n\n460\n00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:45.350\nwhat we really know, and\nI've talked about this before, right?\n\n461\n00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:48.170\nWhat we know is that whoever is sitting\nat the other end of the keyboard\n\n462\n00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:49.270\nknows your password.\n\n463\n00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:50.570\nWe don't necessarily know it's you,\n\n464\n00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:54.030\nbut we do know it's somebody who\nhas access to your credentials.\n\n465\n00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:55.910\nWe wanna be clear about that distinction.\n\n466\n00:21:55.910 --> 00:22:00.360\nWe talked about this with regards\nto integrity mechanisms and\n\n467\n00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.990\ndigital signing in prior episodes.\n\n468\n00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:07.730\nWe talked about this in the thought\nprocess around the idea that as we\n\n469\n00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:12.470\nsend a digital signature to authenticate\nwho we are, if we're signing an email for\n\n470\n00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:14.550\ninstance, right, with a message digest,\n\n471\n00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:18.580\nthe has value that's specific to\nthe digitally signing of that message.\n\n472\n00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:19.670\nWhen we do that,\n\n473\n00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:24.350\nwhat we really know when we talk about\nvalidation of the proof of sender.\n\n474\n00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:26.650\nSo proof of origin non-repudiation.\n\n475\n00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:30.430\nWhat we really know is that\nsomebody with your credential\n\n476\n00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:31.720\nwas on the other end sending?\n\n477\n00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:35.300\nWe don't know if it was really you\nunless we add additional factors of\n\n478\n00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:39.880\nauthentication into that mix and make you\nprove it's you beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n479\n00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.870\nSo, I always wanna stipulate that.\n\n480\n00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:43.240\nI always wanna clarify that.\n\n481\n00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:46.930\nWe talked about these kinds of\nexplanations because we just theoretically\n\n482\n00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:49.810\nsay, yeah, 'we challenge you and\nyou provided, so it must be you'.\n\n483\n00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:51.440\nWell, no it's not you.\n\n484\n00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.710\nIt could be anybody who has\naccess to your credential.\n\n485\n00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:58.470\nIt could be somebody making you do\nthat by coercing you and it's not,\n\n486\n00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:02.060\nalthough it is technically you,\nit's not you because you wanna be there,\n\n487\n00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:04.260\nit's because somebody's\nforcing you to do it, right?\n\n488\n00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:07.400\nSo there's all these variables\nto go in this conversation.\n\n489\n00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.340\nThat as security professionals,\nwe have to take into account or\n\n490\n00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:14.200\nconsider, which is why we don't\ntend to use simplistic mechanisms,\n\n491\n00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:19.450\nlike without additional factors of\nauthentication to further reinforce and\n\n492\n00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:23.220\noverlay and\nvalidate that really is the right user.\n\n493\n00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:26.150\nAnd that they are able to validate\nthat beyond a reasonable doubt, so\n\n494\n00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:28.280\nwe just wanna make sure\nwe're aware of that.\n\n495\n00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.010\nObviously, if you can't\nvalidate the thought process,\n\n496\n00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:34.550\nyou're not able to provide the challenge,\nwe disassociate the session.\n\n497\n00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:36.340\nWe assume it's not you, we cut you off.\n\n498\n00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:37.948\nRemember MS as we talked about,\n\n499\n00:23:37.948 --> 00:23:39.997\n[CROSSTALK] the client\nspecific extension of chat.\n\n500\n00:23:39.997 --> 00:23:40.519\nWhat?\n\n501\n00:23:40.519 --> 00:23:41.679\n&gt;&gt; Like meet in the middle attacks.\n\n502\n00:23:41.679 --> 00:23:45.705\nSo, if someone were to obtain\ninformation pertaining to a session.\n\n503\n00:23:45.705 --> 00:23:48.695\nIf I send that challenge,\nlike you just mentioned,\n\n504\n00:23:48.695 --> 00:23:52.895\nthey may be able to obtain a little\nbit of information for a conversation.\n\n505\n00:23:52.895 --> 00:23:56.475\nBut they'll get the nix if,\nafter they send that additional,\n\n506\n00:23:56.475 --> 00:23:57.355\nthat random challenge.\n\n507\n00:23:57.355 --> 00:23:59.345\n&gt;&gt; They would be cut off, correct.\n\n508\n00:23:59.345 --> 00:24:01.785\nThe session would essentially be\nnullified because they don't know how\n\n509\n00:24:01.785 --> 00:24:02.325\nto validate it.\n\n510\n00:24:02.325 --> 00:24:05.720\nOr we validated it but validated\nnegatively, which means it's not you.\n\n511\n00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.930\nSo we would cut you off, so that is\na great example of where that would occur.\n\n512\n00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:11.417\nYou did mention curb roast, I want to talk\nabout curb roast a little bit as well.\n\n513\n00:24:11.417 --> 00:24:14.142\nWe are not going to go there yet\nbut I know you have a diagram, so\n\n514\n00:24:14.142 --> 00:24:16.720\njust make sure we have that\navailable as I know you will do.\n\n515\n00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.784\nWhen we're ready for it.\n\n516\n00:24:17.784 --> 00:24:19.742\nBut let's talk about Kerberos for\na minute.\n\n517\n00:24:19.742 --> 00:24:23.083\nSo, Kerberos is another way of\nthinking about authentication,\n\n518\n00:24:23.083 --> 00:24:24.490\npretty common these days.\n\n519\n00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:27.080\nIt's been common since\nthe advent of Windows 2000.\n\n520\n00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:30.340\nMicrosoft makes Kerberos as\nfamous as it is, or infamous,\n\n521\n00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:32.110\ndepending on your point of view,\nI suppose.\n\n522\n00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:36.930\nBecause they take the generic version of\nKerberos, again, not Microsoft specific.\n\n523\n00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:40.610\nAnd they implemented some minor touches,\ntweaks, and variations\n\n524\n00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:45.090\ninside Windows 2000 as we shift to what we\nthink of today as the Active Directory.\n\n525\n00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:45.890\nAnd as a result,\n\n526\n00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:50.500\nstarting with Windows 2000 all the way\nthrough the modern day we have Kerberos\n\n527\n00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:54.410\nrunning under the hood as our primary\nauthentication mechanism in Windows.\n\n528\n00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:57.880\nNot the only one, but\nthe primary one we use on a regular basis.\n\n529\n00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:01.140\nIt allows the user to login,\nthe authentication server\n\n530\n00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:04.910\nwill verify the identity and\ncontact the tick and granting server.\n\n531\n00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:07.404\nWe're gonna run through the vocabulary\nof all the moving parts,\n\n532\n00:25:07.404 --> 00:25:09.596\nwhat we call the components\nof Kerberos here in a minute.\n\n533\n00:25:09.596 --> 00:25:11.558\nWe're gonna stick this\nup on the screen for\n\n534\n00:25:11.558 --> 00:25:14.130\nyou, as soon as I just fix\na little typo that I had there.\n\n535\n00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:15.250\nSo we're gonna fix that.\n\n536\n00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:16.730\nWe'll put that up in just a second, but\n\n537\n00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:21.520\nbefore we do, we talk about this\nidea of users authenticating.\n\n538\n00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:25.840\nAnd requesting authentication by\nvalidating their identity at what's called\n\n539\n00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:28.350\na TGS, a ticket granting server.\n\n540\n00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:31.250\nBut the ticket granting server has\nto interact with something known\n\n541\n00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:33.690\nas an authentication server, an AS.\n\n542\n00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:39.100\nAnd so the idea is that ultimately,\nthis the server that authorizes the user.\n\n543\n00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:42.220\nAnd a lot of times, especially in\nthe Windows implementation of Kerberos,\n\n544\n00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:45.340\nthere is a Linux, Unix,\nnon-Windows version that can be used.\n\n545\n00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:49.320\nAnd Kerberos was initially designed to be\nused in Linux Unix, and not in Windows.\n\n546\n00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.550\nIt's a product of research\ndone at MIT years ago,\n\n547\n00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:53.730\nunder the code name Project Athena.\n\n548\n00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:56.830\nAnd so it actually comes to us\nfrom a non-Microsoft world.\n\n549\n00:25:56.830 --> 00:26:00.280\nBut when we implement it in Microsoft,\nremember, it's the domain controller that\n\n550\n00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:03.800\nbecomes the focal point of the nexus,\nright, the pivot point for all this.\n\n551\n00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:08.040\nAnd so domain controllers are KDCs,\nkey distribution servers or\n\n552\n00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.650\nkey distribution centers you hear\nthem referred to differently.\n\n553\n00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:15.990\nBut the idea basically is that they\nform the role and all the thought\n\n554\n00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:19.480\nprocesses around the roles in Kerberos\nare centered around the domain controller.\n\n555\n00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.380\nAnd so when we implement,\nwe have all these systems and\n\n556\n00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:25.510\nthese roles sitting in the domain\ncontroller traditionally in Windows.\n\n557\n00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:29.340\nWe'd break them out and talk about them\nseparately, but a lot of times the TGS,\n\n558\n00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:32.850\nthe ticket granting server,\nthe AS, the authentication server.\n\n559\n00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:36.670\nBoth those functions are sitting in\nthe domain controller in Windows\n\n560\n00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:37.790\nin one machine.\n\n561\n00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:40.920\nBut they are services that\nsimply run under Windows and\n\n562\n00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:44.028\nprovide those capabilities\nunder the guise of Kerberos.\n\n563\n00:26:44.028 --> 00:26:47.830\nSo we're gonna put up a list of all\nthe components here in a minute, but\n\n564\n00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:51.410\nremember that depending on how you\nimplement Kerberos, you may see a single\n\n565\n00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:55.450\nmachine that does all this, as opposed\nto broken out individual machines.\n\n566\n00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:59.340\nAlthough, in many diagrams,\nyou will see the TGS and\n\n567\n00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:03.290\nthe AS role broken out, but\nyou will see them together.\n\n568\n00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:07.200\nOften labeled on one server because\nthat's typically how it's done.\n\n569\n00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.230\nSo just understand the subtlety there, but\n\n570\n00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:13.560\nwe get that and then we send the encrypted\nticket back to the user's machine\n\n571\n00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:16.820\nto represent their identity and\nprove that they're authorized.\n\n572\n00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:20.830\nWhen a user then wants to\naccess resources In the system,\n\n573\n00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:25.920\nthey provide that encrypted ticket,\ncalled a TGT, a ticket granting ticket.\n\n574\n00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:32.010\nAnd they use that TGT in order to be\nable to then send in a request that is\n\n575\n00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:37.180\ngonna be validated by the authentication\nserver on the ticket granting service.\n\n576\n00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:41.900\nAnd that ticket granting services is gonna\nlook at this and go you'd like to talk to\n\n577\n00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:46.120\na DNS server, a web server, file and\nprint server, whatever the resource is.\n\n578\n00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.200\nYou want access?\n\n579\n00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.130\nYou need a special ticket to do that.\n\n580\n00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:52.740\nHere's an ST, right, a service ticket.\n\n581\n00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:56.980\nThis ticket can be used for you to be able\nto connect to that machine and interact.\n\n582\n00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:02.760\nAnd so we get that access from the master\nTGT ticket by making a request and\n\n583\n00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:07.550\nproving our identity, and then having a\nsecondary ticket issue that we can claim,\n\n584\n00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:11.640\nessentially, or use for\none-time access to that resource.\n\n585\n00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:14.570\nWe establish a session,\nan open communication channel,\n\n586\n00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:18.130\nwe use the resource, and when we're done\nwe essentially get rid of that session.\n\n587\n00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:22.120\nWe break it down and then we have to get\nanother ST, another session ticket or\n\n588\n00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.930\nservice ticket,\nevery time we go to connect.\n\n589\n00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:29.210\nSo before you jump in with\nthe out of the box analogy.\n\n590\n00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:32.110\nLet me throw one out there for\nyou that you may or may not know about.\n\n591\n00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:35.372\nThis is very contextual to how old you\nare, where you grew up and whether or\n\n592\n00:28:35.372 --> 00:28:37.119\nnot you've ever had this experience.\n\n593\n00:28:37.119 --> 00:28:37.780\nBut I know and\n\n594\n00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:41.939\nI'm assuming you've probably taken your\nkids to Disney World at some point.\n\n595\n00:28:41.939 --> 00:28:43.853\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Perhaps many times, I'm sure,\n\n596\n00:28:43.853 --> 00:28:45.510\nas all parents tend to do.\n\n597\n00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:49.450\nBut when I was a kid growing up because\nif you've taken them to Disney World,\n\n598\n00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:52.320\nyou never experienced this\nunless you did it as a kid.\n\n599\n00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.829\nBut as I kid when I was growing up and\n\n600\n00:28:53.829 --> 00:28:56.758\nremember you look at me I'm a little\nbit long in the tooth, right?\n\n601\n00:28:56.758 --> 00:29:00.257\nSo when I was a kid going to Disney World,\ndecades ago you,\n\n602\n00:29:00.257 --> 00:29:03.557\ndidn't pay this ridiculously\nlarge amount of money.\n\n603\n00:29:03.557 --> 00:29:04.182\n&gt;&gt; It's huge.\n\n604\n00:29:04.182 --> 00:29:10.098\n&gt;&gt; And go in and just get, okay, $100 in\nchange a day US and we'll give you a pass.\n\n605\n00:29:10.098 --> 00:29:12.440\nAnd you could just go right\nin as often as you want.\n\n606\n00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:16.530\nIt wasn't like that, you paid, certainly\nto get in, but you paid an entrance fee.\n\n607\n00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:18.780\nAnd then you went and\ngot books of tickets.\n\n608\n00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:23.600\nAnd when you got books of tickets, you got\na certain number of tickets in the book\n\n609\n00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:27.180\nto ride on certain rides, like Space\nMountain was a certain kind of ticket and\n\n610\n00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:29.170\ntook a certain amount, and whatever.\n\n611\n00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:32.920\nAnd then you would buy more ticket books\nwhen you wanted to go on more rides.\n\n612\n00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:35.060\nSo this was a very different\nway of doing it back them.\n\n613\n00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:38.420\nBut that's what it was like when\nI grew up going to Disney World.\n\n614\n00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:39.090\nAnd so\n\n615\n00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:44.280\nwhen you think about that, it is kind of\nlike that Kerberos analogy where you would\n\n616\n00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:48.940\nget the general approval to be authorized,\nyou'd pay your entrance fee to go in.\n\n617\n00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:52.150\nBut then you had to go and\nget tickets to do individual things, and\n\n618\n00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:55.250\nbe given session or\nservice specific tickets.\n\n619\n00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:57.203\nAnd you'd always run out of\nSpace Mountain tickets, but\n\n620\n00:29:57.203 --> 00:29:59.450\nyou'd have a whole bunch of leftover for\nthe PeopleMover.\n\n621\n00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:01.429\nCuz nobody wanted to go on\nthe PeopleMover, right?\n\n622\n00:30:01.429 --> 00:30:02.591\nThat was my most fun ride in the world.\n\n623\n00:30:02.591 --> 00:30:03.570\nCuz you got to sit down and relax.\n\n624\n00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:05.443\n&gt;&gt; The Carousel of Technology,\nwhat about that?\n\n625\n00:30:05.443 --> 00:30:07.810\nThe Carousel of Progress,\nI loved that one.\n\n626\n00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:09.770\nThat one, and again,\ndepending on how old you are,\n\n627\n00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:12.160\nyou may not remember this because\nthey certainly don't have it now.\n\n628\n00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:14.570\nAnd they may not have had it when\nyou were going there as a kid.\n\n629\n00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:16.900\nBut they had a sky tram,\nan actual cable car.\n\n630\n00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:17.750\n&gt;&gt; I remember that, yes.\n\n631\n00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:18.430\n&gt;&gt; You remember that one.\n\n632\n00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:22.160\nThat would go from Tomorrow Land over\ninto where It's a Small World was.\n\n633\n00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.750\nAnd you would get off right there,\nand you would then be able to go down.\n\n634\n00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:28.030\nAnd so you would ride that back and\nforth, and that was also cool.\n\n635\n00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:30.340\nThat was really, cuz then you could\nride and look at everybody and\n\n636\n00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:32.290\nsee where everybody was and it was great.\n\n637\n00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:35.610\nSo that was kinda the cool Disneyland,\nDisney World story.\n\n638\n00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:38.260\nSo it's Disney World not Disneyland,\nbut Disney World story.\n\n639\n00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:43.510\nSo we bring in all sorts of knowledge and\nthrow it in the blender here at ITProTV.\n\n640\n00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:45.720\nAnd sometimes we get a really\ncool protein smoothie.\n\n641\n00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:46.960\nOther times, yeah,\n\n642\n00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.730\nyou start over again because it just\ndoesn't make what you were hoping for.\n\n643\n00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:50.510\n&gt;&gt; Soylent.\n\n644\n00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:51.375\n&gt;&gt; Soylent Green.\n\n645\n00:30:51.375 --> 00:30:52.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Soylent Green,\n\n646\n00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:53.870\nyou ever see Soylent Green?\n\n647\n00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:54.370\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; See the movie?\n\n648\n00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:55.117\n&gt;&gt; But it's a real thing now.\n\n649\n00:30:55.117 --> 00:30:56.060\n&gt;&gt; Charlton Heston?\n\n650\n00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:58.240\n&gt;&gt; It is now, but\nit comes from the movie Soylent Green.\n\n651\n00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.572\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I know.\n&gt;&gt; Which is a whole different concept we\n\n652\n00:30:59.572 --> 00:31:00.255\ndon't wanna talk about.\n\n653\n00:31:00.255 --> 00:31:01.117\n&gt;&gt; We don't wanna talk about that.\n\n654\n00:31:01.117 --> 00:31:04.500\n&gt;&gt; But a cool movie if you have\nnot seen it nonetheless, right?\n\n655\n00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:07.323\nAll right so let's,\nwe do have, are we ready?\n\n656\n00:31:07.323 --> 00:31:09.738\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; We're ready.\n\n657\n00:31:09.738 --> 00:31:10.580\n&gt;&gt; We are ready, okay.\n\n658\n00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:13.497\nCan we please put up Cherokee's\nmachine for just a moment?\n\n659\n00:31:13.497 --> 00:31:17.750\nLet's talk about just a visual\nhere real quick on Kerberos.\n\n660\n00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:20.445\nWe'll go back, we'll take a look at\ncomponents in a minute on my machine.\n\n661\n00:31:20.445 --> 00:31:23.678\nBut this is kind of an interesting\ndiagram, so as Cherokee and\n\n662\n00:31:23.678 --> 00:31:27.986\nI were talking about how we are gonna just\ncreate a picture so to speak of Kerberos.\n\n663\n00:31:27.986 --> 00:31:30.533\nAnd how we're gona put that together,\nCherokee said, wait,\n\n664\n00:31:30.533 --> 00:31:32.987\nwait I think I have great picture-\n&gt;&gt; I can't take credit for this one.\n\n665\n00:31:32.987 --> 00:31:33.802\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm not saying you are.\n\n666\n00:31:33.802 --> 00:31:35.395\nI am gonna give credit when credit is due.\n\n667\n00:31:35.395 --> 00:31:37.180\nBut I think I have great picture?\n\n668\n00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:37.970\nRonnie?\n\n669\n00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:38.740\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n670\n00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:41.080\nSo, I got it.\n\n671\n00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:43.330\nSo Ronnie had created this one.\n\n672\n00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:46.510\nOne of the other show hosts here at\nITProTV had created this diagram for\n\n673\n00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:47.670\nanother set of shows.\n\n674\n00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:50.340\nAnd she said, wait, this is gonna be\nawesome, you're gonna love this, right?\n\n675\n00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:52.510\nSo let's look at this one,\nsee if you like this one.\n\n676\n00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:54.930\nAnd so she brought it up and\nof course it has to do with movies.\n\n677\n00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:56.630\nSo I thought, well this is awesome,\nwe've gotta use this.\n\n678\n00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:57.970\nSo, thank you, Ronnie.\n\n679\n00:31:57.970 --> 00:31:59.990\nThank you, Cherokee.\n\n680\n00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:01.740\nLet's talk about the movie analogy for\nKerberos.\n\n681\n00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:03.891\nCuz I thought this was\nsuch an insightful and\n\n682\n00:32:03.891 --> 00:32:07.740\nbrilliant way to actually talk about\nKerberos, I think this is just awesome.\n\n683\n00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:09.620\nSo Ronnie did a great job with this.\n\n684\n00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:12.591\nI really wanna give him credit because\nthis is a pretty cool way to describe it.\n\n685\n00:32:12.591 --> 00:32:15.018\nAnd a way that will hopefully allow\nyou to remember, most importantly.\n\n686\n00:32:15.018 --> 00:32:16.674\nWhich is why I think it's so cool.\n\n687\n00:32:16.674 --> 00:32:18.687\nCuz most of us have had this\nexperience at some point,\n\n688\n00:32:18.687 --> 00:32:19.999\nwhere you've gone to the movies.\n\n689\n00:32:19.999 --> 00:32:22.611\nAnd you wanna be able to get a ticket,\nand they ask you okay,\n\n690\n00:32:22.611 --> 00:32:23.873\nwhat movie are you here for?\n\n691\n00:32:23.873 --> 00:32:27.448\nAnd by the way before we even get to that,\ndo you have a military ID, or\n\n692\n00:32:27.448 --> 00:32:30.128\nare you a senior citizen,\nI start to get that [CROSSTALK]\n\n693\n00:32:30.128 --> 00:32:31.284\n&gt;&gt; If it's rated R.\n\n694\n00:32:31.284 --> 00:32:32.930\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Is it rated R, right.\n\n695\n00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:33.809\nAre you a student?\n\n696\n00:32:33.809 --> 00:32:36.380\nDo you have a student ID cuz we\nwanna give you a discount, right.\n\n697\n00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:39.963\nSo, you show up and\nagain I'm gonna ask you to point just.\n\n698\n00:32:39.963 --> 00:32:40.970\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I can't control.\n\n699\n00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:44.190\nSo you're there, a little stick figure,\nright there, and\n\n700\n00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:47.820\nyou're making a request and\nyou go to the box office right?\n\n701\n00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:49.120\nAnd there's a person at the box office,\n\n702\n00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:53.060\nthey ask you for, you say can I have a\nticket, they say okay, do you have an ID?\n\n703\n00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:54.100\nAre you old enough?\n\n704\n00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:55.840\nCan you prove who you are,\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n705\n00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:59.520\nSo you exchange some information\nto validate who you are, and\n\n706\n00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:03.330\nunder what conditions we can authorize\nyou and grant you a ticket, right?\n\n707\n00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:04.880\nAnd so this is the whole exchange.\n\n708\n00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.160\nAnd so we have a client at\nthe bottom there, you know,\n\n709\n00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.860\nin theory if you think about\nthe user being a client.\n\n710\n00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:10.990\nAnd we have, in the background,\n\n711\n00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:14.130\nyou'll see in the upper right behind\nthe box office we have the KDC,\n\n712\n00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:17.950\nwhich I thought was the popcorn maker for\na minute until I looked at that carefully.\n\n713\n00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:21.977\nBut we have the KDC, which is going to\nthe be the Key Distribution Center.\n\n714\n00:33:21.977 --> 00:33:26.384\nThat is the domain controller slash\nAS authentication server slash tgs,\n\n715\n00:33:26.384 --> 00:33:31.218\nticket granting server all those functions\nwe talked about are gonna be rolled up\n\n716\n00:33:31.218 --> 00:33:31.880\nin there.\n\n717\n00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:34.820\nAnd so\nthe box office is gonna then be able to or\n\n718\n00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:38.270\nthe entity the person In the box office.\n\n719\n00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:41.430\nSays, okay, you showed me this\ninformation, show me your ID,\n\n720\n00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:43.540\npay the right amount of money,\n\n721\n00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:46.540\nthis is the movie you want to go see,\nhere's your tickets.\n\n722\n00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:49.660\nSo they gave us the TG at\nthe lower left hand corner there.\n\n723\n00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:51.200\nThe ticket granting ticket.\n\n724\n00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:53.630\nSo that's what we got essentially for\nour money.\n\n725\n00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:55.470\nAnd then we walk over, so\n\n726\n00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:59.360\nyou know kind of go inside the theater and\nwe meet the person who's at\n\n727\n00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:02.740\nthe little area there where they take\nyour tickets whoever that would be.\n\n728\n00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:05.520\nI love the fact that no matter how we\ndo this, we've always got a Bob and\n\n729\n00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:06.191\nan Alice right?\n\n730\n00:34:06.191 --> 00:34:08.420\nThere's never like two Alice's,\nnever two Bob's,\n\n731\n00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:10.173\n[CROSSTALK] it's always a Bob and\nan Alice.\n\n732\n00:34:10.173 --> 00:34:13.290\nI mean they always have a man and\na woman generically as stick figures.\n\n733\n00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:14.910\nThey always have the wavy arms.\n\n734\n00:34:14.910 --> 00:34:17.110\nAlice always has the great hair day and\nthe cool skirt.\n\n735\n00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:20.250\nAnd Bob looks like a shlump cuz he's\nnever dressed nicely no matter what.\n\n736\n00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:21.652\nI don't know why Alice stays with Bob,\n\n737\n00:34:21.652 --> 00:34:23.446\nshe should get somebody\nwho's a better dresser.\n\n738\n00:34:23.446 --> 00:34:25.589\n[CROSSTALK] I mean,\nyou would think after all these years,\n\n739\n00:34:25.589 --> 00:34:26.820\n[CROSSTALK] she's have learned.\n\n740\n00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:30.900\nA least, minimum,\nmake him put on a pair of eyes and a nose.\n\n741\n00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:33.825\nMaybe a set of glasses, at least shoes.\n\n742\n00:34:33.825 --> 00:34:37.180\nGuy's walking around with no shoes,\ngot no hands, no fingers.\n\n743\n00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:38.390\nHow does he hold the ticket?\n\n744\n00:34:38.390 --> 00:34:41.130\nThese are all questions we\ngotta figure out, right?\n\n745\n00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:42.667\nBut on another episode, not now.\n\n746\n00:34:42.667 --> 00:34:43.187\nSo,\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n747\n00:34:43.187 --> 00:34:45.068\nshe's gotta figure out a way\nto tear this ticket in half.\n\n748\n00:34:45.068 --> 00:34:47.930\n&gt;&gt; And she has no hands, no arms, right.\n\n749\n00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:49.710\nShe has arms but no hands, no fingers.\n\n750\n00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:51.021\nShe's gonna use the force.\nThat's what she's gonna do.\n\n751\n00:34:51.021 --> 00:34:51.787\nShe's gonna use the force.\n\n752\n00:34:51.787 --> 00:34:52.656\n&gt;&gt; All right, I like it.\n\n753\n00:34:52.656 --> 00:34:56.557\n&gt;&gt; So Bob shows up there with his TG,\nhis Ticket Granting ticket, right?\n\n754\n00:34:56.557 --> 00:34:59.980\nAnd it's a little bit hard to read,\nbut you can see the dialogue.\n\n755\n00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:02.540\nEssentially, it would be,\nhey, ticket please, right?\n\n756\n00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:05.600\nOur female usher, or\nwhoever that is, or Alice character.\n\n757\n00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.270\nCan you please give me your ticket, right?\n\n758\n00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:10.150\nYou're supposed to go to this\nBob hands the ticket to her.\n\n759\n00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:12.182\nShe reads it, and she says okay great,\n\n760\n00:35:12.182 --> 00:35:15.150\nyou're going over to theater\nnumber whatever, right?\n\n761\n00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:20.859\nIt says you're gonna be in theater 43 for\nthe matinee showing in five minutes.\n\n762\n00:35:20.859 --> 00:35:22.340\nKeep your ticket stub, right?\n\n763\n00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:25.778\nSo okay, that's where you're gonna go.\n\n764\n00:35:25.778 --> 00:35:28.086\nNow it actually should be feet are 42,\nnot 43,\n\n765\n00:35:28.086 --> 00:35:30.640\ncuz 42 is on the right-hand\nside of that diagram.\n\n766\n00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:33.500\nLittle typo in the balloon,\nbut no big deal, right?\n\n767\n00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.562\nSo it should be in feet are 42, right?\n\n768\n00:35:35.562 --> 00:35:37.020\nAnd so we're gonna go over there.\n\n769\n00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:38.560\nSo Bob says, okay, no problem.\n\n770\n00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:40.580\nI'm gonna hold onto my ticket, right?\n\n771\n00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:42.810\nAnd then I'm gonna go where I need to go.\n\n772\n00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:45.318\nAnd so okay, he goes off,\ndoes his thing, gets his popcorn,\n\n773\n00:35:45.318 --> 00:35:47.650\ngets his oversized drink\nridiculously priced, right?\n\n774\n00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:49.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then goes over, gets ready and\n\n775\n00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:53.640\nthen we have another person\nthere in front of door 42 and\n\n776\n00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:57.040\nshe says hey, can I see your\nticket stub before I let you in,\n\n777\n00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:58.870\ncuz she's validating that\nhe's in the right place.\n\n778\n00:35:58.870 --> 00:36:03.130\nNow, if it really was supposed to be\ntheater 43 and he shows up at theater 42,\n\n779\n00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:06.725\nthen he shouldn't be let in based\non the ticket he has right.\n\n780\n00:36:06.725 --> 00:36:11.348\nSo he may have to get another ticket\nspecific to this particular theater, or\n\n781\n00:36:11.348 --> 00:36:14.034\nif it really is supposed to be theater 42.\n\n782\n00:36:14.034 --> 00:36:18.265\nWe just have a little typo there,\nright then he in theory could be let in\n\n783\n00:36:18.265 --> 00:36:22.035\nbecause he has the right ticket for\nthat particular theater.\n\n784\n00:36:22.035 --> 00:36:25.545\nBut what we're missing here is the ST,\nthe secondary ticket that would allow him\n\n785\n00:36:25.545 --> 00:36:30.170\nentry Into the specific theater or\nto consume the specific network service\n\n786\n00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:33.065\nright above the dialog box that you\nsee at the edge of the picture there.\n\n787\n00:36:33.065 --> 00:36:38.510\nAnd what would happen is Bob would have\nto actually go back to the box office,\n\n788\n00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:42.338\nassuming that he was supposed\nto go to theater 43 but\n\n789\n00:36:42.338 --> 00:36:44.740\nreally wound up at theater 42.\n\n790\n00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:50.248\nHe has to go back to the box office,\nrequest another ticket for theater 42, and\n\n791\n00:36:50.248 --> 00:36:55.850\nbe given that specific ticket that would\nallow Alice to let him into theater 42.\n\n792\n00:36:55.850 --> 00:37:01.450\nAnd then, show up and present his ST,\nalong with his TGT, both tickets,\n\n793\n00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:06.110\nto then allow for validation and\ntherefore single use or use of.\n\n794\n00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:10.237\nThe network service or to see the movie\nthrough the yellow spooky door portal\n\n795\n00:37:10.237 --> 00:37:11.875\nthere which is,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n796\n00:37:11.875 --> 00:37:12.655\n&gt;&gt; Kind of creepy,\n\n797\n00:37:12.655 --> 00:37:14.717\ncuz it looks like it's kind of rumpled,\nand\n\n798\n00:37:14.717 --> 00:37:17.025\nmaybe shifting in real time and,\nI don't know.\n\n799\n00:37:17.025 --> 00:37:18.539\nIt's like a Poltergeist kind of thing,\nI'm thinking.\n\n800\n00:37:18.539 --> 00:37:20.256\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But it still works for me.\n\n801\n00:37:20.256 --> 00:37:23.067\nSo.\n&gt;&gt; Bob might not even have access to\n\n802\n00:37:23.067 --> 00:37:26.016\nour network service number 42 there.\n\n803\n00:37:26.016 --> 00:37:29.160\nYou know if we think about you\nknow principal of least privilege.\n\n804\n00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:30.265\nOr whatever.\nSo that's why it's so\n\n805\n00:37:30.265 --> 00:37:31.947\nimportant to go ahead and\nto authenticate right?\n\n806\n00:37:31.947 --> 00:37:34.800\n&gt;&gt; It is because he may as you rightly\npoint out he may not be authorized.\n\n807\n00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:38.372\nMaybe he didn't pay for the right\ntheater or rather the right movie.\n\n808\n00:37:38.372 --> 00:37:42.536\nOr maybe he is not old enough or\nperhaps doesn't belong seeing it.\n\n809\n00:37:42.536 --> 00:37:45.146\nWhatever the case may be there may be\nall these reasons why he may not be\n\n810\n00:37:45.146 --> 00:37:45.930\nauthorized.\n\n811\n00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:47.900\nBut we would not want to let him in.\n\n812\n00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:50.940\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying to think of how we could\nwork in the five minute time off\n\n813\n00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:51.501\nset there.\n\n814\n00:37:51.501 --> 00:37:53.776\nIf everyone's on the same\npage with the same time but\n\n815\n00:37:53.776 --> 00:37:55.680\nmaybe like a walkie talkie or something.\n\n816\n00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:59.359\n&gt;&gt; Well time synchronization is really\nwhat we're talking about with Kerberos\n\n817\n00:37:59.359 --> 00:38:01.805\nspecific to Windows it's\na five minute variable.\n\n818\n00:38:01.805 --> 00:38:04.701\nAnd that is extensible,\nby the way, it's the default but\n\n819\n00:38:04.701 --> 00:38:07.909\nit can be extended out and\nyou can have an offset that's longer.\n\n820\n00:38:07.909 --> 00:38:11.141\nBut generically the idea of time\nsynchronization to keep the ticket\n\n821\n00:38:11.141 --> 00:38:11.940\nsynchronized.\n\n822\n00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:13.337\n&gt;&gt; And the process flowing.\n\n823\n00:38:13.337 --> 00:38:17.645\n&gt;&gt; As we're going is important so I mean,\nyou could say that the time from when Bob\n\n824\n00:38:17.645 --> 00:38:20.470\nis issued the TG,\nthe ticket granting ticket.\n\n825\n00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:22.214\n&gt;&gt; That's the time on the ticket.\n\n826\n00:38:22.214 --> 00:38:25.930\n&gt;&gt; Maybe his, his ST, if he gets\na secondary ticket specific for the movie.\n\n827\n00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:26.445\n&gt;&gt; Good one.\n\n828\n00:38:26.445 --> 00:38:29.307\n&gt;&gt; And then the time he shows up to\nactually go into the theater would be that\n\n829\n00:38:29.307 --> 00:38:30.640\nfive-minute offset.\n\n830\n00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:33.610\nAnd if he takes longer than that,\nthe ticket's no longer valid.\n\n831\n00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:35.247\nWe give his seat to somebody else.\n\n832\n00:38:35.247 --> 00:38:35.901\n&gt;&gt; That's great.\n\n833\n00:38:35.901 --> 00:38:37.328\n&gt;&gt; Because Bob's just SOL when.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n834\n00:38:37.328 --> 00:38:38.866\n&gt;&gt; When that happens, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Look at that, on the fly.\n\n835\n00:38:38.866 --> 00:38:39.941\nGenius.\n\n836\n00:38:39.941 --> 00:38:43.717\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so Bob better not stand\nin that line at concession stand for\n\n837\n00:38:43.717 --> 00:38:44.770\ntoo longer.\n\n838\n00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:48.571\nFlirt with Alice at that first checkpoint\nfor too longer or he's not getting a seat.\n\n839\n00:38:48.571 --> 00:38:51.859\nHave you been to recently,\nthis is happened to me recently.\n\n840\n00:38:51.859 --> 00:38:55.091\nAnd I'm curious, because when I started\ngoing to the movies years ago as a kid,\n\n841\n00:38:55.091 --> 00:38:58.276\nI'm old enough that I actually remember\nseeing Star Wars the original movie in\n\n842\n00:38:58.276 --> 00:39:00.110\nthe theater when it came out, right.\n\n843\n00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:02.960\nSo I actually went to see it when\nit first came out in the theater.\n\n844\n00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:04.760\nNone of this watching on TV junk.\n\n845\n00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:07.000\nI saw it for real on the big screen.\n\n846\n00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.823\nBut when you went to the movie theater\nyears ago, you bought your ticket,\n\n847\n00:39:10.823 --> 00:39:12.620\nyou walked in, and you got a seat.\n\n848\n00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:14.073\nYou sat wherever you wanted.\n\n849\n00:39:14.073 --> 00:39:18.720\nNone of this reserved seating,\ncinema draft theater, uber experience,\n\n850\n00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:19.760\nlazy boy stuff.\n\n851\n00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:21.690\nYou just sat in an uncomfortable seat.\n\n852\n00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:24.377\nAnd you sat like this, it was like being\non an airplane and you watched a movie,\n\n853\n00:39:24.377 --> 00:39:25.950\nbut you sat anywhere you wanted.\n\n854\n00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:27.510\nLately in the last few years,\n\n855\n00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:29.730\nthey've got this whole upscale\nmovie experience thing, right?\n\n856\n00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:34.530\nSo I know we talked about the fact\nthat here the one theatre is down for\n\n857\n00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:35.740\nrepairs and all that.\n\n858\n00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:36.988\nSo you have to go to another theater.\n\n859\n00:39:36.988 --> 00:39:41.040\nBut when you go, I'm assuming they\nhave theaters like this up here.\n\n860\n00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:42.314\n&gt;&gt; I haven't been to a fancy one.\n\n861\n00:39:42.314 --> 00:39:44.566\n&gt;&gt; You've not been to a fancy one where\nyou reserve your seat ahead of time?\n\n862\n00:39:44.566 --> 00:39:45.860\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n863\n00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:47.328\n&gt;&gt; So boy, are you in for a treat.\n\n864\n00:39:47.328 --> 00:39:48.137\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, now,\n\n865\n00:39:48.137 --> 00:39:51.615\nin some of these up scale theaters,\nthey are actually,\n\n866\n00:39:51.615 --> 00:39:54.170\nit's like buying an airline ticket.\n\n867\n00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:58.599\nYou have to check in, online, you can go\nin ahead of time and buy your ticket but\n\n868\n00:39:58.599 --> 00:40:00.633\nyou reserve your seat on a seat map.\n\n869\n00:40:00.633 --> 00:40:04.487\nAnd then you show up and they actually\nsay okay, not just here is AC but\n\n870\n00:40:04.487 --> 00:40:08.270\nyou're sitting in like seat\nnumber five in row three, right?\n\n871\n00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:10.694\nSo that part while you would think\nit is but here's the challenge.\n\n872\n00:40:10.694 --> 00:40:14.508\nSo I go to see, I figure out what\nmovie it was recently, I took my kids,\n\n873\n00:40:14.508 --> 00:40:17.957\nmy wife, I think we had some of\nmy sister in law's kids with us.\n\n874\n00:40:17.957 --> 00:40:22.135\nSo we had or maybe my wife's cousins or\nsomething, we had like a significant,\n\n875\n00:40:22.135 --> 00:40:24.730\na large group like Ten people\nwith us go to the movies.\n\n876\n00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:29.258\nSo we went and bought all these tickets,\nbought almost an entire row,\n\n877\n00:40:29.258 --> 00:40:32.120\nand we had literally\nseats one through ten.\n\n878\n00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:34.947\nSo we get all these,\nwe go in, we go to sit down.\n\n879\n00:40:34.947 --> 00:40:39.562\nThere is a family that's already there\nsitting in some of the seats that we had\n\n880\n00:40:39.562 --> 00:40:41.200\nbought and were reserved.\n\n881\n00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:45.260\nAnd so we said to the gentleman,\nthe father, look, here's the deal.\n\n882\n00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:47.948\nWe have these seats,\nwe need you guys to move down,\n\n883\n00:40:47.948 --> 00:40:50.769\nyour seats are kind of over\nthere towards the far end.\n\n884\n00:40:50.769 --> 00:40:51.530\nWe're not moving.\n\n885\n00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:53.609\nWhat do you mean you're not moving?\n\n886\n00:40:53.609 --> 00:40:54.941\nWell, we're not moving,\nthese are our seats.\n\n887\n00:40:54.941 --> 00:40:56.790\nSo, we had this whole conversation.\n\n888\n00:40:56.790 --> 00:41:00.701\nGentlemen refused to get up and move, and\nI felt bad because now we had to sit and\n\n889\n00:41:00.701 --> 00:41:03.858\nI thought we were potentially\ntaking somebody else's seats.\n\n890\n00:41:03.858 --> 00:41:07.660\nBecause one person screws\nthe seating map up, everybody's off.\n\n891\n00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:10.415\nSo he made a big deal,\nthis would not move, and\n\n892\n00:41:10.415 --> 00:41:15.233\nwe wound up not having to sit in his seats\npartially but in somebody else's seat.\n\n893\n00:41:15.233 --> 00:41:16.924\nSo, it became this whole big mess.\n\n894\n00:41:16.924 --> 00:41:20.745\nAnd finally the ushers had to come,\nand the manager had to come, and\n\n895\n00:41:20.745 --> 00:41:23.303\nhe just wasn't getting\nout of those chairs.\n\n896\n00:41:23.303 --> 00:41:26.674\nIt was ridiculous, and I'm thinking\nI'm paying all this extra money so\n\n897\n00:41:26.674 --> 00:41:30.225\nI can essentially be inconvenienced and\nnot be able to enjoy the movie.\n\n898\n00:41:30.225 --> 00:41:32.374\nBoy, this is a thing I\nwanna go do time and again.\n\n899\n00:41:32.374 --> 00:41:34.570\nSo, this is why I no longer\ngo to movie theaters.\n\n900\n00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:37.698\n&gt;&gt; So you're saying Kerberos\nover real life movies any day?\n\n901\n00:41:37.698 --> 00:41:41.116\n&gt;&gt; I'm just saying that when you have to\npay exorbitant amounts of money to reserve\n\n902\n00:41:41.116 --> 00:41:45.090\na seat in the theater, and you can't get\nthat seat, that's not a good outcome.\n\n903\n00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:47.250\nThat's what I'm saying.\n&gt;&gt; Some people's kids.\n\n904\n00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:48.652\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, no, you see,\nit was the father.\n\n905\n00:41:48.652 --> 00:41:49.427\nI mean, it wasn't the kids.\n\n906\n00:41:49.427 --> 00:41:50.121\n&gt;&gt; I mean, some people's.\n\n907\n00:41:50.121 --> 00:41:51.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n908\n00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:54.570\nYeah, well yeah, somewhere, some how,\nsome way he had parents, that's very true.\n\n909\n00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:58.002\nAnd they clearly did not teach him how to\nplay nicely with others in the sandbox, so\n\n910\n00:41:58.002 --> 00:41:59.211\nthat is part of the problem.\n\n911\n00:41:59.211 --> 00:42:00.450\nAnd if we can go to my machine for\n\n912\n00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:02.801\na minute just to wrap up this\nconversation on Kerberos..\n\n913\n00:42:02.801 --> 00:42:06.620\nI just wanna show you quickly what\nthe moving parts, the components are, for\n\n914\n00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:07.470\nKerberos.\n\n915\n00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:09.660\nSo, I promised you we'd\nquickly list them for you.\n\n916\n00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:13.059\nYou can see there we have\nwhat's called the Principal,\n\n917\n00:42:13.059 --> 00:42:17.193\nthis is essentially just the entity\nthat is requesting the ticket.\n\n918\n00:42:17.193 --> 00:42:19.799\nIt's a user and/or a computer,\nor a server, or\n\n919\n00:42:19.799 --> 00:42:21.527\na client of some kind of client.\n\n920\n00:42:21.527 --> 00:42:23.865\nIt's just a user in\nthe language of Kerberos.\n\n921\n00:42:23.865 --> 00:42:27.128\nAuthentication server, the AS,\nwe talked about this role.\n\n922\n00:42:27.128 --> 00:42:29.024\nThe TGS, talked about this.\n\n923\n00:42:29.024 --> 00:42:33.539\nThe KDC, the key distribution center,\nthis role we talked about as well.\n\n924\n00:42:33.539 --> 00:42:37.531\nI mentioned that Kerberos comes to us from\nLinux-Unix outside of the Windows world\n\n925\n00:42:37.531 --> 00:42:38.435\ninitially.\n\n926\n00:42:38.435 --> 00:42:42.646\nThe realm is what we refer\nto a domain-like environment\n\n927\n00:42:42.646 --> 00:42:45.342\nto be outside of the Windows world.\n\n928\n00:42:45.342 --> 00:42:48.830\nIt's the boundary within an organization,\nsecurity boundary entity.\n\n929\n00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:51.174\nEach realm will have its\nown authentication and\n\n930\n00:42:51.174 --> 00:42:54.582\nticket granting services associated\nwith it in the Kerberos model.\n\n931\n00:42:54.582 --> 00:42:56.220\nThink of realm,\nthink of domain and Windows,\n\n932\n00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:58.480\nthey're essentially\nsynonymous with one another.\n\n933\n00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.512\nTicket Granting Ticket,\nwe talked about that.\n\n934\n00:43:00.512 --> 00:43:02.590\nThe ticket itself, we talked about that.\n\n935\n00:43:02.590 --> 00:43:07.213\nAnd the Session Key, which is temporary\nencryption key that is used for\n\n936\n00:43:07.213 --> 00:43:10.385\nthe exchange of that\ninformation as a one-off.\n\n937\n00:43:10.385 --> 00:43:11.701\nWe've spoken about all these things.\n\n938\n00:43:11.701 --> 00:43:14.667\nSo, these are all the different\ncomponents associated with Kerberos.\n\n939\n00:43:14.667 --> 00:43:16.720\nJust wanted to make sure you\ngot a chance to see them.\n\n940\n00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:20.645\nWe were referring to them, so I wanted to\nmake sure you had a way to associate those\n\n941\n00:43:20.645 --> 00:43:24.112\nreferences with some definitions\nthat you could note and, of course,\n\n942\n00:43:24.112 --> 00:43:25.013\nyou could study.\n\n943\n00:43:25.013 --> 00:43:26.661\nAnd I'm sure you're comfortable with,\n\n944\n00:43:26.661 --> 00:43:28.600\nas we wrap up our conversation\nhere on Kerberos.\n\n945\n00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:29.356\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great.\n\n946\n00:43:29.356 --> 00:43:30.619\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; We do have some\n\n947\n00:43:30.619 --> 00:43:35.320\nmore information to cover, so stay tuned\nand grab your popcorn for the show.\n\n948\n00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:37.040\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this show.\n\n949\n00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:38.681\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n950\n00:43:38.681 --> 00:43:42.230\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon, otherwise known\nas the ticket granting server.\n\n951\n00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:44.108\n&gt;&gt; And we won't charge you a million\ndollars for this popcorn either.\n\n952\n00:43:44.108 --> 00:43:44.662\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n953\n00:43:44.662 --> 00:43:46.906\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n954\n00:43:46.906

00:00:08.172\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.172 --> 00:00:11.548\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.548 --> 00:00:13.328\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your ECES series.\n\n6\n00:00:13.328 --> 00:00:15.580\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.275\nIn this episode, we'll be looking\nat technology such as PGP,\n\n8\n00:00:20.275 --> 00:00:23.564\nsome wireless technologies, SSL and TLS.\n\n9\n00:00:23.564 --> 00:00:26.900\nAnd with us today, we have Mr.\nAdam Gordon in studios.\n\n10\n00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.018\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n11\n00:00:28.018 --> 00:00:30.989\nAnd it's always a surprise with our-\n&gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be a surprise if Daniel was\n\n12\n00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:32.394\nhere and\nhe popped up when you said Adam Gordon?\n\n13\n00:00:32.394 --> 00:00:34.457\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I was thinking you're saying,\n\n14\n00:00:34.457 --> 00:00:37.319\nyou're not looking, you're just\nsaying it's me, but if I had run out,\n\n15\n00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:38.378\nwe should do that one time.\n\n16\n00:00:38.378 --> 00:00:39.969\nWe should have like Ronnie or\nDaniel ot Mike-\n\n17\n00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:40.666\n&gt;&gt; More surprises.\n\n18\n00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:42.266\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Pop up, instead of me and\n\n19\n00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:43.721\nyou'll be like, my God, what happened?\n\n20\n00:00:43.721 --> 00:00:48.399\nAnyway, so here we are just being random,\nit's random day here at ITPro.TV.\n\n21\n00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:51.704\nSo we're gonna talk about random stuff,\nbut it's actually not random at all.\n\n22\n00:00:51.704 --> 00:00:52.882\nThere is not only a rhyme or\n\n23\n00:00:52.882 --> 00:00:56.647\na reason, methodology to how we present\nthe information, but there is a purpose.\n\n24\n00:00:56.647 --> 00:00:59.867\nAnd let's talk more broadly as we\ncontinue to build out our knowledge in\n\n25\n00:00:59.867 --> 00:01:03.928\nthese episodes, specifically around\nthe applications of cryptography.\n\n26\n00:01:03.928 --> 00:01:07.748\nAround not just the knowledge we need\nto understand how to secure something,\n\n27\n00:01:07.748 --> 00:01:11.768\nand not just the mechanisms like\nKerberos so we can use to authenticate.\n\n28\n00:01:11.768 --> 00:01:16.599\nBut now some of the broader ways in which\nwe see this thought process applied to\n\n29\n00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:19.829\ninformation transmission securely,\nas you said.\n\n30\n00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:24.139\nSo things like VPN,\nweb access, SSLTLS, wireless,\n\n31\n00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:26.909\nso Wi-Fi and\nencryption on the Wi-Fi solution.\n\n32\n00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.498\nWe're continuing to build and\nadd layers to this thought process.\n\n33\n00:01:30.498 --> 00:01:34.052\nThis picture that we're building around\nhow cryptography can be applied in\n\n34\n00:01:34.052 --> 00:01:37.129\nthe real world, and so\nwe're gonna continue that journey.\n\n35\n00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:41.630\nYou mentioned PGP probably a great place\nfor us to think about jumping back in.\n\n36\n00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.000\nSo pretty good privacy, created by a\ngentleman named Phil or Philip Zimmermann.\n\n37\n00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.111\nInteresting little thought process\nthat went along with this thing cuz he\n\n38\n00:01:50.111 --> 00:01:53.824\ngot himself in trouble with the US\ngovernment who came after him and\n\n39\n00:01:53.824 --> 00:01:55.830\nsued him over PGP back in the 90s.\n\n40\n00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.410\nAnd ultimately it's interesting cuz these\nthings tend to go away and come back.\n\n41\n00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:06.465\nSo he goes off, Mr. Zimmermann does,\ncreates another iteration of PGP.\n\n42\n00:02:06.465 --> 00:02:11.127\nAnd then PGP winds up getting sold and\nis now a commercially available product.\n\n43\n00:02:11.127 --> 00:02:12.597\nCuz he gave it out for free and\n\n44\n00:02:12.597 --> 00:02:16.690\nrefused to divulge certain information\nabout how it worked and what it was.\n\n45\n00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.076\nAnd there was this whole little\ntiff that went on for a while.\n\n46\n00:02:19.076 --> 00:02:24.080\nBut basically, PGP is now owned by I\nthink Symantec, if I'm not mistaken.\n\n47\n00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.434\nAlthough they've bought up half\nthe world so, I think it's them.\n\n48\n00:02:27.434 --> 00:02:31.194\nBut it's now a commercially available\nencryption suite that you can use and\n\n49\n00:02:31.194 --> 00:02:32.540\nmany businesses do.\n\n50\n00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.521\nThere's something called OGP,\nwhich is also out there.\n\n51\n00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:37.652\nThere's other PGP knockoff clients,\n\n52\n00:02:37.652 --> 00:02:41.290\nI actually have one on in\nmy Blackberry that I use.\n\n53\n00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.640\nSo it is an interesting little program,\nbut the generic thought process is,\n\n54\n00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.817\nand people often confuse this and\nget this wrong.\n\n55\n00:02:46.817 --> 00:02:50.594\nThey think PGP is a protocol or\nan algorithm for encryption or\n\n56\n00:02:50.594 --> 00:02:52.080\nsecure transmission.\n\n57\n00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.486\nIt's actual piece of software that is\ndesigned to allow the average person to\n\n58\n00:02:56.486 --> 00:03:00.096\nmaking cryption and\ndecryption highly available and usable.\n\n59\n00:03:00.096 --> 00:03:04.580\nBut it's a piece of software it's\nnot an app, it's not an algorithm,\n\n60\n00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.017\nit's not a protocol.\n\n61\n00:03:06.017 --> 00:03:10.937\nAnd it's implemented using PGP software\nin a variety of different ways\n\n62\n00:03:10.937 --> 00:03:14.636\nto be able to allow you to encrypt and\ndecrypt easily.\n\n63\n00:03:14.636 --> 00:03:19.036\nAnd share encryption and decryption\ncapabilities with others easily through\n\n64\n00:03:19.036 --> 00:03:21.510\na common software based extended network.\n\n65\n00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.230\nThis idea of trust that we've been talking\nabout on one of the prior episodes.\n\n66\n00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.990\nSo it's just and\n\n67\n00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.910\ninteresting little aside to the footnotes\nin the history of cryptography.\n\n68\n00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.860\nBut PGP is a certificate based\napplication and piece of software.\n\n69\n00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.810\nSo use a certificates, and\nwe talked about certificates before.\n\n70\n00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.750\nBut there are certain specific things that\nare included in the PGP certificates.\n\n71\n00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.080\nYou may wanna know what they are.\n\n72\n00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.664\nIf you could throw my machine for\njust a second,\n\n73\n00:03:43.664 --> 00:03:45.500\nwe'll show you some notes\non that real quick.\n\n74\n00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.663\nYou could see PGP version number,\ncertificate holders public key,\n\n75\n00:03:49.663 --> 00:03:54.844\ncertificate holders information, digital\ncertificate of the certificate owner.\n\n76\n00:03:54.844 --> 00:03:56.914\nCertificate validity period,\nand of course,\n\n77\n00:03:56.914 --> 00:03:59.160\npreferred symmetric algorithm for the key.\n\n78\n00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.441\nThese are the main things that\nare gonna be incorporated there,\n\n79\n00:04:02.441 --> 00:04:05.244\nthe six main things we see\ninside the PGP certificate.\n\n80\n00:04:05.244 --> 00:04:07.524\nSi just good to know that,\nbe aware of that, and\n\n81\n00:04:07.524 --> 00:04:09.299\nhave a sense of that if ever comes up.\n\n82\n00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.598\nIf you're ever asked at\nsome point in the future,\n\n83\n00:04:11.598 --> 00:04:14.026\nif somebody stops you on the street,\nout of breath.\n\n84\n00:04:14.026 --> 00:04:17.700\nHey, what was that fifth item on\nthat list for PGP certificates?\n\n85\n00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.900\nYou should be able to hopefully,\nsay certificate validity period\n\n86\n00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.020\nas you're running quickly down\nthe street the other way.\n\n87\n00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.075\nScream it over your shoulder,\nmake sure they hear you, right?\n\n88\n00:04:25.075 --> 00:04:26.795\nBut run away quickly.\n\n89\n00:04:26.795 --> 00:04:30.470\nRandom story and random side,\nas you know we're very good for this here.\n\n90\n00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.970\nI am very good for this here,\nI should say ITPro.TV.\n\n91\n00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.038\nMost other people don't break into random\nasides unless they're presenting with me.\n\n92\n00:04:36.038 --> 00:04:39.780\nBut I was sitting at an airport\nwaiting on a flight as I often am,\n\n93\n00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.196\ncuz I do travel a great deal for\nwhat I do.\n\n94\n00:04:42.196 --> 00:04:45.589\nAnd I'm sitting at the bar there\nkind of hanging out watching TV,\n\n95\n00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:49.390\nwaiting on the flight,\nI've had my computer open doing some work.\n\n96\n00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.196\nSomebody sits down next to me and\norders a drink,\n\n97\n00:04:51.196 --> 00:04:52.615\nand is just kind of doing their thing.\n\n98\n00:04:52.615 --> 00:04:56.320\nAnd at some point looks over, sees my\ncomputers, sees what I'm working on,\n\n99\n00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.399\ndoing a bunch of different stuff,\nand says, hey what do you do?\n\n100\n00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:02.570\nYou've got some interesting software and\nthings on your computer.\n\n101\n00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:03.313\nWhat is it you do for a living?\n\n102\n00:05:03.313 --> 00:05:07.565\nWe start talk a little about what I do at\nleast what I divulge that I do in public\n\n103\n00:05:07.565 --> 00:05:09.101\nto people anyway, right?\n\n104\n00:05:09.101 --> 00:05:12.500\nAnd so we talked about that, talk about\nwhat this person does, and okay, great,\n\n105\n00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.270\nwhatever.\n\n106\n00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.470\nVery nice, good to meet you,\ngood to meet you.\n\n107\n00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.530\nTurns out we wind up\nbeing on the same flight,\n\n108\n00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.181\nrandom events being what they are,\nwind up sitting next to each other, right?\n\n109\n00:05:21.181 --> 00:05:23.074\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you never know, right?\n\n110\n00:05:23.074 --> 00:05:26.201\nAnd so we're on the plane,\nwe're sitting next to each other,\n\n111\n00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:29.397\nboth have our laptops out,\nwe're both working, doing stuff.\n\n112\n00:05:29.397 --> 00:05:32.279\nAnd I'm using at that time anyway,\nI was using PGP, and for\n\n113\n00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:36.100\nsomething I was communicating with\na client or sending an email or something.\n\n114\n00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.362\nAnd I had PGP and I was using it,\nand so the person next to me,\n\n115\n00:05:40.362 --> 00:05:42.168\nwho I made friends with.\n\n116\n00:05:42.168 --> 00:05:45.854\nLooks over, and says, PGP,\nthis is so cool, I use PGP, and so\n\n117\n00:05:45.854 --> 00:05:47.480\nwe start talking about PGP.\n\n118\n00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.097\nAnd we're talking about how it works, and\nhow they use it, and what they use it for\n\n119\n00:05:51.097 --> 00:05:51.998\nand all this stuff.\n\n120\n00:05:51.998 --> 00:05:55.373\nAnd so you just you never know where\nthis kind of stuff will come up\n\n121\n00:05:55.373 --> 00:05:56.380\nin the real world.\n\n122\n00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.895\nPeople use this technology all the time,\nyou just may not realize it or may not\n\n123\n00:06:00.895 --> 00:06:03.845\nrealize that other people are using it\nthe same way you are, you just never know.\n\n124\n00:06:03.845 --> 00:06:06.560\nSo never take anything for\ngranted when it comes to PGP.\n\n125\n00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.866\nCuz you will find more often enough\nthat a lot of people are using it,\n\n126\n00:06:09.866 --> 00:06:11.905\nand this is something to just be aware of.\n\n127\n00:06:11.905 --> 00:06:14.275\nSo let's talk about something\nelse everybody uses,\n\n128\n00:06:14.275 --> 00:06:18.170\nsomething that is ubiquitous as we say,\nwireless and Wi-Fi, right?\n\n129\n00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:19.700\nQuick little quiz for you without looking.\n\n130\n00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.876\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Do you know what WEP stands for?\n\n131\n00:06:22.876 --> 00:06:24.628\n&gt;&gt; Wired Equivalent Privacy.\n\n132\n00:06:24.628 --> 00:06:25.572\n&gt;&gt; That's good.\n\n133\n00:06:25.572 --> 00:06:27.536\nI should not spell everything\nout in my notes from now on.\n\n134\n00:06:27.536 --> 00:06:28.972\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We'll see if you can get\n\n135\n00:06:28.972 --> 00:06:29.569\nthat on the fly.\n\n136\n00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:32.956\nHow about WPA?\n\n137\n00:06:32.956 --> 00:06:37.046\n&gt;&gt; Wi-Fi Protected Access.\n\n138\n00:06:37.046 --> 00:06:38.460\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, very, very good.\n\n139\n00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.429\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, all right,\n\n140\n00:06:40.429 --> 00:06:42.290\nI can't fool Cherokee today.\n\n141\n00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:44.229\nWe're gonna come up with some other\nones later she's never heard of.\n\n142\n00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:47.289\nI'm gonna make up an acronym,\nmake it sound all official and\n\n143\n00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:50.357\nclaim that she just is ridiculous for\nnot knowing what it is.\n\n144\n00:06:50.357 --> 00:06:51.389\nBut don't tell her.\n\n145\n00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:52.653\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right, so\n\n146\n00:06:52.653 --> 00:06:53.598\nyou're absolutely right.\n\n147\n00:06:53.598 --> 00:06:55.277\n&gt;&gt; I don't think you have\nto make anything up that.\n\n148\n00:06:55.277 --> 00:06:55.982\nI'm sure you'll get to one.\n\n149\n00:06:55.982 --> 00:06:57.537\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm sure you'll know,\n\n150\n00:06:57.537 --> 00:06:58.525\nregardless of what it is.\n\n151\n00:06:58.525 --> 00:07:03.972\nSo WEP and WPA, and of course WPA2, WPA2\nEnterprise are very common protocols, and\n\n152\n00:07:03.972 --> 00:07:09.431\nalgorithms, and implementations, you could\nhear them referred to different ways.\n\n153\n00:07:09.431 --> 00:07:13.752\nBut these are things that we will be using\nand do use all the time to set up and\n\n154\n00:07:13.752 --> 00:07:17.401\nmaintain security for\nWi-Fi based systems for encryption.\n\n155\n00:07:17.401 --> 00:07:20.050\nSo WEP,\nwe've talked about WEP in prior episodes.\n\n156\n00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.201\nWe know WEP is not to be used,\nlet me underscore that, not.\n\n157\n00:07:23.201 --> 00:07:25.874\nSee, this is where we need the visuals,\nwhere we could say not, and we have-\n\n158\n00:07:25.874 --> 00:07:26.678\n&gt;&gt; A big flasher flashing, yeah.\n\n159\n00:07:26.678 --> 00:07:29.788\n&gt;&gt; A big not flashing on the screen\nin red, with the buzzing sound,\n\n160\n00:07:29.788 --> 00:07:30.774\nwhere they do that.\n\n161\n00:07:30.774 --> 00:07:31.575\n&gt;&gt; Danger, danger.\n\n162\n00:07:31.575 --> 00:07:32.294\n&gt;&gt; Not, right?\n\n163\n00:07:32.294 --> 00:07:33.446\nAnd it would flash-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n164\n00:07:33.446 --> 00:07:34.381\n&gt;&gt; With a big red X, and\n\n165\n00:07:34.381 --> 00:07:36.251\nyou would hear that so that people know,\n\n166\n00:07:36.251 --> 00:07:38.564\nvisually it will imprint\non their subconscious.\n\n167\n00:07:38.564 --> 00:07:40.286\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And scare the heck out of them,\n\n168\n00:07:40.286 --> 00:07:41.910\nthat they should never use WEP, right?\n\n169\n00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:42.531\nSo we need that.\n\n170\n00:07:42.531 --> 00:07:44.572\nThis is when we [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Especially when it has a name like\n\n171\n00:07:44.572 --> 00:07:46.480\nWired Equivalent Privacy,\nit's very misleading.\n\n172\n00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:51.988\nWell I guess at the time that they weren't\nassuming that you were using any type of,\n\n173\n00:07:51.988 --> 00:07:54.199\nSecurity on that wired network.\n\n174\n00:07:54.199 --> 00:07:57.303\nSo people,\nthey kind of think wired is more secure so\n\n175\n00:07:57.303 --> 00:07:59.060\nit might be equivalent to that.\n\n176\n00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.610\nBut no, don't go down that path at all.\n\n177\n00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:03.950\n&gt;&gt; No, they should have called\nit really bad implementation and\n\n178\n00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:05.820\ncrappy security protocol or something.\n\n179\n00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:09.620\nCuz it just unfortunately was not\nimplemented correctly, as we talked about.\n\n180\n00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:13.071\nThe reality is, that WEP could have\nactually been implemented, and\n\n181\n00:08:13.071 --> 00:08:16.641\nto this day, been made something that\nwe would still use had they made,\n\n182\n00:08:16.641 --> 00:08:20.270\nthey being the people that implemented\nit and created a standard for it,\n\n183\n00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.250\nhad made different choices.\n\n184\n00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:26.940\nThis is an example of not really being\naware of certain fundamental facts about\n\n185\n00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.990\nhow technology works and\nnot understanding how to scale this\n\n186\n00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:34.690\ninto a future where there\nmay be tremendous adoption.\n\n187\n00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:36.960\nAs opposed to thinking it's just\nnot going to be very popular.\n\n188\n00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.780\nBecause the key breakdown,\n\n189\n00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:43.770\nthe key shortfall here with WEP was the\nfact that the keyspace was so small, and\n\n190\n00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:48.430\nthe initialization vector was so\nsmall that keys were being repeated.\n\n191\n00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:51.000\nAnd you know at the time nobody thought\n\n192\n00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.430\nthat this was gonna be\na popular transmission medium.\n\n193\n00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:56.290\nNobody thought that this would be so\npopular, so\n\n194\n00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:59.120\nmuch traffic would go through it that\nthe key space would be an issue.\n\n195\n00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.570\nAnd by the time they figured it out,\n\n196\n00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.060\npeople were busting WEP\ncryptography left and right.\n\n197\n00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:07.570\nAnd decrypt and everything and\nit became essentially a non starter.\n\n198\n00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:10.310\nSo we use RC4 which is a stream\n\n199\n00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:13.400\ncypher which is very strong\nif implemented correctly.\n\n200\n00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:18.170\nTo secure the data, we use a CRC32\ncheck sum for error checking, so\n\n201\n00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:23.010\na cyclic redundancy check 32 bit\ncheck sum and we use a 40 bit\n\n202\n00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:28.110\nkey which unfortunately was too small and\na 24 bit iv which again was too small.\n\n203\n00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:32.600\nAnd as a result WEP kinda came in and\nwent so quickly because we used it but\n\n204\n00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.450\nit was just unfortunately broken\nalmost immediately not secure.\n\n205\n00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:36.375\nThe funny part is,\n\n206\n00:09:36.375 --> 00:09:39.756\nit is still around and you still see\nit in many hardware implementations.\n\n207\n00:09:39.756 --> 00:09:43.870\nMeaning when you see wireless switches,\nrouters things like that and\n\n208\n00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:47.750\nyou pull down and look at what you can\nchoose on a lot of these wireless access\n\n209\n00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:50.830\npoints you still see WEP there\neven though it should not be used\n\n210\n00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:53.150\ncuz they just never programmed\nit out of the firmware.\n\n211\n00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:56.270\nIt's almost like a floppy drive,\nyou wonder why you still have one.\n\n212\n00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.010\nThere really isn't a legitimate need\nthese days to use one, for the most part.\n\n213\n00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:00.745\n&gt;&gt; We all know Adam's secret now.\n\n214\n00:10:00.745 --> 00:10:02.850\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But we still do have that ability, and\n\n215\n00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:06.380\nwe still have drive letter\nA hard coated to be the floppy,\n\n216\n00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.640\nas opposed to being recovered, and\nbeing used in a non floppy environment.\n\n217\n00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:10.705\nI'm gonna start a campaign.\n\n218\n00:10:10.705 --> 00:10:12.790\nNon-floppys, all right?\n\n219\n00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:16.424\nGet rid of all the drive A designations,\nand recover drive A.\n\n220\n00:10:16.424 --> 00:10:19.154\n&gt;&gt; Well, people nowadays,\nthey just know it as the saving symbol.\n\n221\n00:10:19.154 --> 00:10:22.900\nTo save, save and save as,\nyou see it on a lot of software.\n\n222\n00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:23.400\n&gt;&gt; You do.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n223\n00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:23.900\n&gt;&gt; You do.\n\n224\n00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:24.640\nBut what does that have to do\n\n225\n00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:25.300\nwith a floppy disks?\n\n226\n00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:25.900\n&gt;&gt; It's the icon.\n\n227\n00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.560\n&gt;&gt; You mean,\nbecause they see the picture you mean.\n\n228\n00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.290\n&gt;&gt; They put the little, and\nkid's these days they just see and\n\n229\n00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:30.570\nthey think of that's the save button.\n\n230\n00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:31.810\nAnd you're like no that's a floppy.\n\n231\n00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:33.150\n&gt;&gt; That's true, but\nthey don't know what that is.\n\n232\n00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:33.932\n&gt;&gt; No they don't know.\n\n233\n00:10:33.932 --> 00:10:34.760\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's true.\n\n234\n00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:35.290\nThat's true.\n\n235\n00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:38.230\nA lot of people just call them\nthe save as, I guess that's true.\n\n236\n00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:39.000\nThat's very true.\n\n237\n00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.750\nAlright, so that was our random aside.\n\n238\n00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:42.020\nThat Cherokee dragged me into.\n\n239\n00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:43.170\nSo, high five for that.\n\n240\n00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:44.000\nYou did it again.\n\n241\n00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:44.550\n&gt;&gt; Sorry.\nOkay.\n\n242\n00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:45.410\nI'm learning.\n\n243\n00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:47.290\n&gt;&gt; I was trying but you did it again.\n\n244\n00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:49.070\nAll right.\nSo, WiFi protected access,\n\n245\n00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.730\nyou defined this one for us as well.\n\n246\n00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:54.270\nWPA is the first attempt to replace WEP,\nright?\n\n247\n00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:57.320\nBecause WEP clearly didn't do very good,\nwe had a lot of problems with it,\n\n248\n00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.490\npeople were reading our information.\n\n249\n00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:01.020\nUnacceptable, can't do that.\n\n250\n00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:02.740\nSo we gotta figure it out.\n\n251\n00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.360\nInstead of retooling WEP.\n\n252\n00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.300\nAnd saying, let's change the way we\nimplement because they knew that if they\n\n253\n00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.790\ndid that,\nnobody would believe that it was secure.\n\n254\n00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:12.300\nSo they did retool it but\nthey also renamed it.\n\n255\n00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.090\nSo now we get Wi-fi Protected Access WPA.\n\n256\n00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:21.190\nWe replaced RC4 with something known as\nTKIP Temporal Key Integrity Protocol,\n\n257\n00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:24.690\n128 bit per packet keys.\n\n258\n00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:26.620\nWe have a much stronger key right?\n\n259\n00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:29.380\nRoughly three times stronger\nthan what WEP would've used.\n\n260\n00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.630\nAnd we dynamically generate new keys for\neach packet.\n\n261\n00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:34.160\nThat was the big thing with TKIP.\n\n262\n00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.720\nEverybody thought that was gonna\nbe the phenomenal fix we needed.\n\n263\n00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:38.770\nBut boy, were they wrong.\n\n264\n00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:42.640\nBecause they implemented TKIP\nincorrectly and it didn't go very well.\n\n265\n00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.220\nAnd WPA again,\nalthough it was good for a time,\n\n266\n00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:49.960\nalso fell victim to being\nessentially decrypted over time,\n\n267\n00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.350\nbecause again, traffic flow,\nkey space, things like that.\n\n268\n00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:54.419\n&gt;&gt; It really didn't last that long\nbefore they created the WPA2,\n\n269\n00:11:54.419 --> 00:11:55.660\nit was kinda like a band-aid for WEP.\n\n270\n00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.030\n&gt;&gt; It didn't, that would appeal\nto a WPA2 enterprise as well.\n\n271\n00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:59.681\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So, it was out there for\n\n272\n00:11:59.681 --> 00:12:03.739\nbit, it was stronger, definitely was\nbetter, but it was not good enough.\n\n273\n00:12:03.739 --> 00:12:07.340\nAnd so we then go to WPA2,\nessentially 2nd generation WPA.\n\n274\n00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:12.400\nThis is based on IEEE 802.11i\nstandards for wireless.\n\n275\n00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:17.931\nActually the first implementation that\nfully implements 802.11i as a standard,\n\n276\n00:12:17.931 --> 00:12:22.794\nand gets it fully implemented the right\nway, WEP and WPA, chipped away at it,\n\n277\n00:12:22.794 --> 00:12:26.550\ntried elements of it but\ndidn't implement it fully.\n\n278\n00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:31.290\nSo we use AES, we swap out TKIP and\nwe swapped out of course RC4.\n\n279\n00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:34.470\nWe use AES, Advanced Encryption Standard,\nwe've talked about that.\n\n280\n00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:36.180\nThat replaces DES if you remember.\n\n281\n00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:42.260\nWith CCMP another protocol that is used\nto do a cypher block chaining, and\n\n282\n00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.280\nto do all the things we talked\nabout that make this more secure.\n\n283\n00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.480\nAnd so we provide enhanced\nconfidentiality, integrity, and\n\n284\n00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.310\nauthentication with WPA2.\n\n285\n00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:52.470\nSo it is seen as being much stronger and\n\n286\n00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:56.260\nbecause of the use of AES it's\nconsidered to be usable and acceptable.\n\n287\n00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.620\nBut for usually non Enterprise,\n\n288\n00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:04.320\nnon commercial use meaning you in\nthe home and for private use we use WPA2.\n\n289\n00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:09.870\nWPA2 Enterprise is used, which builds\non to WPA2 but really just adds one\n\n290\n00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:15.490\nadditional feature which is the ability to\nbe able to use radio servers for triple A.\n\n291\n00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:19.110\nAuthentication, auditing and\naccess control.\n\n292\n00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:21.265\nAnd so we also use EAP,\n\n293\n00:13:21.265 --> 00:13:24.980\nextensible authentication\nprotocol to do authentication.\n\n294\n00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:28.680\nAnd people sometimes don't\nunderstand what EAP is.\n\n295\n00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:29.660\nIt is a protocol.\n\n296\n00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:33.390\nBut it is actually a extensible\nprotocol that provides a framework so\n\n297\n00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:37.610\nthat we can attach new authentication\nmechanisms instead of having to create\n\n298\n00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:42.280\na brand new protocol every time, we can\nloop them in under the guise of EAP.\n\n299\n00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.220\nAnd attach them so.\n\n300\n00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:44.310\n&gt;&gt; Very flexible.\n\n301\n00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:47.420\n&gt;&gt; It is very flexible so\nwe will use things like smart cards.\n\n302\n00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:50.140\nThe military and government called\nthem CAC cards for the most part,\n\n303\n00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:52.480\ncommon access control\ncards here in the US.\n\n304\n00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.180\nSo when you want to use a CAC\ncard with a digitally embedded or\n\n305\n00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.510\nan embedded certificate in a digital chip.\n\n306\n00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:01.230\nIn the card you can do that\nthrough the EAP framework and\n\n307\n00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:03.140\nextend that to be able to do that.\n\n308\n00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:05.470\nWe see things like EAP with TLS.\n\n309\n00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:07.960\nWe're gonna talk about TLS\nhere in a minute in SSL.\n\n310\n00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.370\nLooping in TLS, transport layer security,\n\n311\n00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:14.200\ncan be done for enhanced authentication\nthrough the EAP framework.\n\n312\n00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:18.150\nSo WPA2 Enterprise gives us the ability\nto deploy a radius server and\n\n313\n00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:23.190\nto use EAP to extend authentication\noptions on the thought process or\n\n314\n00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:26.010\nthe solution around user validation.\n\n315\n00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:28.270\nWhich makes it a much\nstronger implementation.\n\n316\n00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:34.270\nAlso, just so you know, WPA2 Enterprise\ncommonly referred to as WPA-802.1x.\n\n317\n00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:37.340\nSo that's what we often see referred to.\n\n318\n00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:42.190\nReally, more commonly, 802.1X generically\nas shorthand is what we often see and\n\n319\n00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:45.190\nwhat we mean when we talk\nabout WPA2 Enterprise.\n\n320\n00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:47.690\nSo, just so you're aware of that.\n\n321\n00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:51.200\n&gt;&gt; And sometimes not to\nget confused with 802.11X.\n\n322\n00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:55.438\nSometimes people in books,\nthey'll put the X just when\n\n323\n00:14:55.438 --> 00:14:59.700\nthey're talking about\nthe 802.11 family also.\n\n324\n00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:02.290\nSo don't let that little tiny\nnumber one throw you off there.\n\n325\n00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:05.700\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nOkay, thank you.\n\n326\n00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:09.270\nLittle bit of extra trivia\ndrilling down into the black hole.\n\n327\n00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:12.720\n&gt;&gt; Hey I've taken enough exams\nwhere I see the a b c and d and\n\n328\n00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.380\nMicrosoft they go up to g and h and j.\n\n329\n00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:16.910\n&gt;&gt; They do.\n\n330\n00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:20.420\n&gt;&gt; You see a couple of them and they are\nonly a few letter or characters off and\n\n331\n00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.600\nyou're like okay.\n\n332\n00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.290\n&gt;&gt; Got to pay attention to the results.\n\n333\n00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:24.862\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n334\n00:15:24.862 --> 00:15:27.805\n&gt;&gt; Mistress of the minutiae,\nthat's what we're going to start calling\n\n335\n00:15:27.805 --> 00:15:31.240\nMiss Cherokee over here, but\nit is very important for us to know that.\n\n336\n00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.680\nIt is actually we joke around\nabout some of that stuff, but\n\n337\n00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.810\nit is really important to make that\ndistinction and be aware of that as well.\n\n338\n00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:38.665\nAppreciate you bringing that up for us.\n\n339\n00:15:38.665 --> 00:15:41.270\nWha's say we talk about SSL and\nTLS for just a moment.\n\n340\n00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:42.160\nSo,\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n341\n00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:42.960\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's do that.\n\n342\n00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.100\nSo SSL, right.\n\n343\n00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:45.518\nSo secure socket layer, right.\n\n344\n00:15:45.518 --> 00:15:47.935\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; So we talk about probably one of\n\n345\n00:15:47.935 --> 00:15:51.859\nthe most commonly known and\ncommonly referred to.\n\n346\n00:15:51.859 --> 00:15:56.245\nWays to authenticate and\nto use authentication.\n\n347\n00:15:56.245 --> 00:15:58.940\nIt is ubiquitous,\nit is essentially everywhere today.\n\n348\n00:15:58.940 --> 00:15:59.810\nIt underlies and\n\n349\n00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:03.350\nforms the backbone of most of what we've\ndone on the Internet/World Wide Web,\n\n350\n00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:07.590\nfor better part of the last\n20 to 30 years at this point.\n\n351\n00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:09.236\nActually, a little bit of trivia for you.\n\n352\n00:16:09.236 --> 00:16:10.355\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Do you know who actually created\n\n353\n00:16:10.355 --> 00:16:10.992\nthe SSL standard?\n\n354\n00:16:10.992 --> 00:16:11.820\n&gt;&gt; I do not.\n\n355\n00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:14.990\n&gt;&gt; You do not, have you ever heard\nof a company called Netscape?\n\n356\n00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:16.600\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I have, I do know this now.\n\n357\n00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:20.548\nYes, that was implemented,\nyeah, what, 1995ish?\n\n358\n00:16:20.548 --> 00:16:21.561\nMaybe mid 90s?\n\n359\n00:16:21.561 --> 00:16:23.684\n&gt;&gt; Early mid 90s, so\nbeen around for a lot.\n\n360\n00:16:23.684 --> 00:16:25.294\nBut Netscape's no longer\na company in its own right.\n\n361\n00:16:25.294 --> 00:16:26.837\n&gt;&gt; I do remember that now,\nyou're pulling the cob webs out.\n\n362\n00:16:26.837 --> 00:16:30.168\n&gt;&gt; But they had the cool little ship's\nwheel symbol, the captains with big\n\n363\n00:16:30.168 --> 00:16:30.681\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n364\n00:16:30.681 --> 00:16:32.048\n&gt;&gt; Wood wheel, like a ship, for\n\n365\n00:16:32.048 --> 00:16:33.970\ntheir symbol, for their browser.\n\n366\n00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:36.170\nAwesome browser, right?\n\n367\n00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:37.186\nThe first commercially successful-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n368\n00:16:37.186 --> 00:16:38.562\nwe didn't have any other\noption at that time.\n\n369\n00:16:38.562 --> 00:16:39.437\n&gt;&gt; No, well, you did.\n\n370\n00:16:39.437 --> 00:16:42.550\nIE started coming online,\nand people were using it.\n\n371\n00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:46.265\nChrome was not around,\ncertainly things like Firefox and or\n\n372\n00:16:46.265 --> 00:16:48.565\nSafari had not made their\nway onto the scene yet.\n\n373\n00:16:48.565 --> 00:16:52.839\nBut you basically had Netscape, they owned\nthe internet browser world for many years.\n\n374\n00:16:52.839 --> 00:16:55.148\nThey were the preeminent browser and\nthe only one for\n\n375\n00:16:55.148 --> 00:16:57.862\na period of time that was of\nany significance commercially.\n\n376\n00:16:57.862 --> 00:17:00.302\nThen Microsoft comes along,\nsays we could do better.\n\n377\n00:17:00.302 --> 00:17:04.422\nCreates IE which did not necessarily\ndo as good in the beginning but\n\n378\n00:17:04.422 --> 00:17:07.118\nhas become a great\nbrowser in its own right.\n\n379\n00:17:07.118 --> 00:17:10.947\nThen they kinda duked it out, and\neventually IE as we know probably,\n\n380\n00:17:10.947 --> 00:17:13.332\nmost of us anyway took over, more or less.\n\n381\n00:17:13.332 --> 00:17:15.638\nAnd Netscape kind of just disappeared, but\n\n382\n00:17:15.638 --> 00:17:19.856\nthey actually came out with the SSL\nstandard, they're responsible for that.\n\n383\n00:17:19.856 --> 00:17:22.943\nSo just a little bit of interesting\ntrivia and lore there for you.\n\n384\n00:17:22.943 --> 00:17:23.976\nBut SSL how does it work?\n\n385\n00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:26.159\nA lot of people use it,\nwe use it all the time everyday,\n\n386\n00:17:26.159 --> 00:17:27.693\nwe just don't always think about it.\n\n387\n00:17:27.693 --> 00:17:32.046\nBut we have almost a little four step\nthought process we can go through\n\n388\n00:17:32.046 --> 00:17:35.650\nwhen the browser,\nthe Internet Explorer application,\n\n389\n00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:38.590\nwhatever it is, Chrome, Safari, Firefox.\n\n390\n00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:40.139\nIt doesn't matter what it is,\n\n391\n00:17:40.139 --> 00:17:43.366\nany web browser today asks the web\nserver to prove its identity.\n\n392\n00:17:43.366 --> 00:17:48.328\nSo we're saying, hey, can you validate for\nus who you are, if I'm the web browser and\n\n393\n00:17:48.328 --> 00:17:51.528\nif Cherokee in our example here\nis gonna be the web server,\n\n394\n00:17:51.528 --> 00:17:54.698\nwe would start the conversation by\nsaying can you validate who you are?\n\n395\n00:17:54.698 --> 00:17:56.678\nSo I want to know who I'm talking too,\n\n396\n00:17:56.678 --> 00:18:01.008\nthe server sends back a copy of its\nSSL certificate to me in the browser.\n\n397\n00:18:01.008 --> 00:18:02.558\nSo I say who are you?\n\n398\n00:18:02.558 --> 00:18:05.868\nI get a copy back of the certificate\nfrom the web browser.\n\n399\n00:18:05.868 --> 00:18:07.968\nLoads up in my Internet Explorer or\n\n400\n00:18:07.968 --> 00:18:11.850\nmy web browser whatever it is from the web\nserver I should say not from the browser.\n\n401\n00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:13.620\nThe browser, I will check that,\n\n402\n00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:17.450\nmy application checks it to see if it's\nfrom a CA that I know and I trust.\n\n403\n00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:22.340\nSo, are you trustworthy, can I tell that\nyou are legitimately who you claim to be?\n\n404\n00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:26.240\nAnd if you are, I will then communicate\nwith you, if you're not, then I may or\n\n405\n00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.380\nmay not communicate with you,\nit will just depend.\n\n406\n00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:31.720\nBut this is generically how SSL works,\nit's a very straightforward process.\n\n407\n00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:34.360\nAll we're doing is essentially\ntrading certificates back and\n\n408\n00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.180\nforth to validate our identity, and\n\n409\n00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:39.550\nas long as the certificate are valid,\nthey are authenticated.\n\n410\n00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:42.068\nSo, we can out it them against\nthe CA they're not revoked.\n\n411\n00:18:42.068 --> 00:18:45.697\nThey are legitimate, we normally will\ntrust the person we're talking to, and\n\n412\n00:18:45.697 --> 00:18:49.181\nwe'll open up the website or do business\nor whatever it is you're gonna do.\n\n413\n00:18:49.181 --> 00:18:52.134\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Bank of America checking my,\nor whoever for\n\n414\n00:18:52.134 --> 00:18:56.885\nyour status, how much money you have in\nyour account before you write out checks.\n\n415\n00:18:56.885 --> 00:19:00.416\nOr who still uses checks, but you want to\nmake sure that information is accurate to\n\n416\n00:19:00.416 --> 00:19:02.886\nhave that mutual authentication, right?\n\n417\n00:19:02.886 --> 00:19:06.965\n&gt;&gt; So you will, now there may be other\nmechanisms besides just SSL that are used\n\n418\n00:19:06.965 --> 00:19:09.019\nwhen we get into things like banking.\n\n419\n00:19:09.019 --> 00:19:12.725\nSo for financial services,\nstock trades, banks,\n\n420\n00:19:12.725 --> 00:19:16.110\nchecking your balance, things like that.\n\n421\n00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:19.230\nThere is more than just an SSL\ncertificate that goes back and forth.\n\n422\n00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:23.320\nWe're gonna use different and\nadditional forms of authentication,\n\n423\n00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:27.580\nperhaps a PIN,\nperhaps another mechanism aside from that.\n\n424\n00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:32.340\nWe use single session keys so\nthat nobody can spoof or masquerade and\n\n425\n00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:33.820\ndo a man in the middle attack.\n\n426\n00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:36.460\nThere's a lot of additional\nfunctionality protection and\n\n427\n00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:39.440\ncapabilities brought to\nbear on those transactions.\n\n428\n00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:43.840\nBut they are secured and\nthey certainly are using SSL and or\n\n429\n00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:47.080\nTLS depending on what\nthe website is using these days.\n\n430\n00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:52.449\nTLS kind of taking slowly but surely,\nfor SSL, it's the future if you will.\n\n431\n00:19:52.449 --> 00:19:54.953\nBut there is gonna be that element,\nthere's no doubt about it but\n\n432\n00:19:54.953 --> 00:19:56.737\nwe will see additional\nprotection measures.\n\n433\n00:19:56.737 --> 00:20:00.842\nNot just a single certificate alone which\nin theory, could be spoofed and that's one\n\n434\n00:20:00.842 --> 00:20:04.616\nof the reasons why we don't just use,\na single certificate and nothing else.\n\n435\n00:20:04.616 --> 00:20:05.906\nCuz we wanna make sure it really is you.\n\n436\n00:20:05.906 --> 00:20:07.601\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That you really are checking your\n\n437\n00:20:07.601 --> 00:20:09.278\naccount and\nnot looking at somebody elses or-\n\n438\n00:20:09.278 --> 00:20:10.058\n&gt;&gt; That's why we\n\n439\n00:20:10.058 --> 00:20:12.790\nget time after we are idle for\nX amount of minutes.\n\n440\n00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:16.275\n&gt;&gt; We have session time outs, we have\nsingle session keys to prevent replay\n\n441\n00:20:16.275 --> 00:20:19.420\nattacks, there is a lot of additional\ncapabilities we bring to bare.\n\n442\n00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:22.757\nBut even on the authentication side\nthose are all after we authenticate.\n\n443\n00:20:22.757 --> 00:20:27.480\nBut even with authentication, we have\nthings like picture pass, we may use a key\n\n444\n00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:31.820\nfob for some sort of a challenged\nresponse, so some sort of a token.\n\n445\n00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.950\nIn highly secure environments you'll\nbe asked to go through a series of\n\n446\n00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:38.555\nauthentication steps or additional\ncapabilities will be brought to bear,\n\n447\n00:20:38.555 --> 00:20:40.545\nyou already validated additional factors.\n\n448\n00:20:40.545 --> 00:20:44.415\nSo there's a lot of other stuff that\ngoes on, it's not just certificates.\n\n449\n00:20:44.415 --> 00:20:45.615\nBecause certificates by themselves,\n\n450\n00:20:45.615 --> 00:20:49.505\nalthough they are consider to be\nrelatively secure, can be spoofed\n\n451\n00:20:49.505 --> 00:20:53.495\nif a bad actor tries hard enough and\nhas the right access and capabilities.\n\n452\n00:20:53.495 --> 00:20:56.265\nAnd we obviously wanna defend against\nthat and protect against that.\n\n453\n00:20:56.265 --> 00:21:00.333\nSo help me, if you will, if you don't\nmind, and even if you do, help me anyway.\n\n454\n00:21:00.333 --> 00:21:00.987\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n455\n00:21:00.987 --> 00:21:02.024\n&gt;&gt; So we talked about SSL.\n\n456\n00:21:02.024 --> 00:21:02.703\n&gt;&gt; I'm scared.\n\n457\n00:21:02.703 --> 00:21:03.566\n&gt;&gt; So we talked about\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n458\n00:21:03.566 --> 00:21:05.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, nothing like that.\n\n459\n00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:07.470\nLet's talk about TLS,\nTransport Layer Security.\n\n460\n00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:09.880\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Kind of next gen technology,\n\n461\n00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:14.320\nnext gen thought process up from SSL,\nSSL's been around forever and a day.\n\n462\n00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.270\nIt's good, but\nyou often hear people say, yeah, but\n\n463\n00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:17.760\nwe need something a little bit stronger.\n\n464\n00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:18.781\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; TLS has really\n\n465\n00:21:18.781 --> 00:21:23.000\nbeen put forward as ultimately replacing\nSSL, this is kind of the thought process.\n\n466\n00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.840\nBut we have a bit of explaining\nto do with TLS, right?\n\n467\n00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:30.280\nWe wanna think about this and understand\nhow TLS works, cuz you say to people, SSL,\n\n468\n00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:32.100\nTLS, one or the other or both.\n\n469\n00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:36.170\nEither they don't know about either,\nor they think they know but\n\n470\n00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:38.630\nthey're really describing SSL\nwhen they're describing TLS,\n\n471\n00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:40.360\ncuz maybe they don't\nunderstand the difference.\n\n472\n00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.640\nOr they aren't clear that\nthey're not the same thing,\n\n473\n00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.370\nthey think it's just the name for\none thing.\n\n474\n00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:46.823\nCuz you often see them\nwritten SSL/ TLS together, so\n\n475\n00:21:46.823 --> 00:21:48.852\na lot of people just\nassume it's one thing.\n\n476\n00:21:48.852 --> 00:21:50.948\n&gt;&gt; Or even if they say https and\n\n477\n00:21:50.948 --> 00:21:56.520\nthey say, it's http with ssl\nwhen really it's http with TLS.\n\n478\n00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.810\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, so you know it's almost\nlike the TCP/IP thing, right?\n\n479\n00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:02.098\nYou see it written and you see just\nwe get used to saying it's TCP/IP but\n\n480\n00:22:02.098 --> 00:22:03.873\nit's actually to distinguish\ndifferent protocols.\n\n481\n00:22:03.873 --> 00:22:04.826\n&gt;&gt; Right, protocol suite.\n\n482\n00:22:04.826 --> 00:22:08.970\n&gt;&gt; That happened to just be referred\nto together and it's a protocol suite.\n\n483\n00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:12.350\nAnd so SSL and\nTLS are distinctly different things,\n\n484\n00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:14.750\nlet's start with that right\nbecause they are different.\n\n485\n00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:18.182\nThey do work differently so transport\nlayer security is going to function and\n\n486\n00:22:18.182 --> 00:22:20.924\nbehave differently, so\nwe do just wanna be aware of that, but\n\n487\n00:22:20.924 --> 00:22:23.917\nwe're gonna talk through this\nyou're gonna, help me to do this.\n\n488\n00:22:23.917 --> 00:22:27.525\n&gt;&gt; If you're configuring something on\nthe server for authentication or for\n\n489\n00:22:27.525 --> 00:22:30.666\nour security here, and\nwe have those little radio buttons, and\n\n490\n00:22:30.666 --> 00:22:34.795\nyou're usually see like the option, what\nyou wanna select to who you want to allow,\n\n491\n00:22:34.795 --> 00:22:37.080\nand they have the different versions.\n\n492\n00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:43.990\nSo you can allow people to connect\nVia TLS or SSL to your web server per se.\n\n493\n00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:46.800\nBut, it's an option but by doing so\n\n494\n00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.820\nyou're decreasing the security\nof that web server.\n\n495\n00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:53.450\n&gt;&gt; Well, not necessarily you're\ndecreasing it if you use a lower level\n\n496\n00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:54.620\nauthentication mechanism.\n\n497\n00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:57.338\nBut remember,\nTLS is not considered to be insecure.\n\n498\n00:22:57.338 --> 00:23:00.323\n&gt;&gt; Well, if I allow SSL\nversion one also [INAUDIBLE].\n\n499\n00:23:00.323 --> 00:23:04.940\n&gt;&gt; So, it's a question of what version or\nwhat level of that implementation.\n\n500\n00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:09.467\nWe just want to be clear about that,\nnot the Cherokee said anything wrong, but,\n\n501\n00:23:09.467 --> 00:23:11.664\njust clarifying the way she said it, so\n\n502\n00:23:11.664 --> 00:23:16.325\nthat we clearly understand that it's not\nthat if you choose TLS over SSL by itself,\n\n503\n00:23:16.325 --> 00:23:20.890\nthat you necessarily are allowing or\ndisallowing secure communication.\n\n504\n00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:22.890\nBoth are considered secure.\n\n505\n00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:26.630\nTLS is considered more secure\ntoday because of the way it works.\n\n506\n00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:31.518\nBut, in certain implementations first\nof all TLS can actually be less secure.\n\n507\n00:23:31.518 --> 00:23:34.968\nSecond of all because of the negotiation\nof the lowest common denominator concept\n\n508\n00:23:34.968 --> 00:23:36.719\nfor the authentic mechanism supported.\n\n509\n00:23:36.719 --> 00:23:40.591\nWhich we'll get to in just a second but\npreview [SOUND] spoiler alert,\n\n510\n00:23:40.591 --> 00:23:43.594\nthat's how it works, but\nbefore we get there right,\n\n511\n00:23:43.594 --> 00:23:47.619\nbut the issue is also which is why I\nwanna make sure we're clear on this.\n\n512\n00:23:47.619 --> 00:23:49.714\nThat if you choose SSL as you said,\n\n513\n00:23:49.714 --> 00:23:54.320\nyou then have to choose a version of\nSSL cuz there could be SSL version one.\n\n514\n00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right,or version two is different\n\n515\n00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:59.990\nversion of implementations and clearly the\nolder the version the less secure it is.\n\n516\n00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:01.490\n&gt;&gt; That's usually how it goes.\n\n517\n00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:02.500\n&gt;&gt; Always how it goes.\n\n518\n00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:05.760\nSo that's just what we wanna\nmake sure we're clear on there,\n\n519\n00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:10.550\nbecause it could actually be\nthat SSL can be very secure.\n\n520\n00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:13.690\nIf you implement the most recent\nversion and you use it the right way\n\n521\n00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:16.300\nversus an older version,\nwhich may not be as secure, right?\n\n522\n00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:19.070\nBut yes,\nyou can typically toggle between them.\n\n523\n00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:21.970\nYou do normally have an opportunity or\nan ability if you are the owner of\n\n524\n00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:24.520\nthat server to specify\nthe authentication mechanism.\n\n525\n00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:25.750\nYou're absolutely correct about that,\n\n526\n00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:29.080\nso lets broaden our discussion\na little bit around TLS.\n\n527\n00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:32.120\nSo essentially Client Server,\njust like everything else, right.\n\n528\n00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:35.600\nMe using my web browser,\nCherokee being the web server here.\n\n529\n00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:36.870\nYou want to flip things around?\n\n530\n00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:38.910\nYou want to be the client,\nyou want me to be the web server?\n\n531\n00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:40.200\n&gt;&gt; Whatever.\n&gt;&gt; A little variety.\n\n532\n00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.570\nChange things up a little bit.\n\n533\n00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:42.340\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n534\n00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:43.216\n&gt;&gt; Don't want you to get bored,\nright, it's very important.\n\n535\n00:24:43.216 --> 00:24:43.963\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n536\n00:24:43.963 --> 00:24:45.330\n&gt;&gt; I gotta keep you interested.\n\n537\n00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:46.520\nI need you for two more shows.\n\n538\n00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:47.460\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I gotta make sure you wanna\n\n539\n00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:48.420\nstick around.\n\n540\n00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:49.770\nLet's give you the option.\n\n541\n00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:51.190\nYou're gonna be the web server.\n\n542\n00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:52.030\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm sorry.\n\n543\n00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:53.140\nI'm gonna be the web server.\n\n544\n00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:54.310\nWho's on first, what's on second?\n\n545\n00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:55.500\nI don't know.\nThe web server.\n\n546\n00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:58.420\nAll right, so you ever see Abbott and\nCostello, you're gonna be the client.\n\n547\n00:24:58.420 --> 00:24:59.321\n&gt;&gt; I'm connecting.\n\n548\n00:24:59.321 --> 00:25:00.660\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna be the client,\nyou're gonna connect.\n\n549\n00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.590\nI'm gonna be as the server or\nsense, all right?\n\n550\n00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:05.078\nSo, you and I are gonna-\n&gt;&gt; I'm shopping, I do that a lot online.\n\n551\n00:25:05.078 --> 00:25:07.840\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nCherokee is gonna go with shopping,\n\n552\n00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.600\nI'm gonna go with providing goods and\nservices.\n\n553\n00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.950\nSo, I'm gonna be the server,\nyou're gonna be the client.\n\n554\n00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:13.260\nSo we're gonna have to negotiate.\n\n555\n00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:14.820\nSo we're gonna handshake, right?\n\n556\n00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:17.800\nLike everything starts off where\ntraditionally, you're gonna connect and\n\n557\n00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:21.120\nsay hey, I'd like to establish\nyour communication securely.\n\n558\n00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.110\nSo we're gonna negotiate\nthrough a handshake.\n\n559\n00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:23.980\nLet's shake hands.\n\n560\n00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:26.600\nSo you're gonna say hi, I'm Cherokee.\n\n561\n00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.820\nI wanna be able to prove who I am and\nI want you to prove who you are.\n\n562\n00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:33.450\nAnd I'm gonna say hi, I'm Adam,\nthe web server, nice to meet you.\n\n563\n00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:34.380\nHow much money do you have?\n\n564\n00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:36.150\nAnd is your credit rating\ngood before I let you shop.\n\n565\n00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:37.230\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So I wanna make sure you could\n\n566\n00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:38.080\nspend enough money.\n\n567\n00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.654\nWe don't ask about that,\nI'm only kidding about that.\n\n568\n00:25:39.654 --> 00:25:41.630\nBut we're gonna have a handshake\nprocedure, right, so\n\n569\n00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:45.620\nwe're going to have to\nexchange information\n\n570\n00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:50.390\nthat's going to allow us to establish\nat some sort of common level.\n\n571\n00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:54.270\nHow we're gonna be able to not just\ncommunicate, but communicate securely.\n\n572\n00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:57.550\nSo that we can authenticate our\ncommunications and ultimately provide for\n\n573\n00:25:57.550 --> 00:25:58.400\nsecurity.\n\n574\n00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:03.950\nBut it becomes a question now of,\nhow secure can I be as a server?\n\n575\n00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:06.050\nHow secure can you be as the client?\n\n576\n00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:08.510\nAnd can we reach some sort\nof mutually agreed upon\n\n577\n00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:12.290\ncommon level that allows both of us\nto feel comfortable communicating?\n\n578\n00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:17.300\nSo this is gonna be a little bit different\nthan SSL, which is, hey, who are you?\n\n579\n00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:18.830\nHere's my certificate.\n\n580\n00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:21.420\nOkay, I validated the certificate,\nnow I'm good.\n\n581\n00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:24.970\nWhich is a level of communication,\nis a level of handshake.\n\n582\n00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:29.260\nBut doesn't give either party the ability\nto choose how they're going to\n\n583\n00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:32.780\ncommunicate and negotiate for\nthe lowest common denominator.\n\n584\n00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:38.870\nBut also hopefully, the strongest possible\ncommunication platform that both support.\n\n585\n00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:40.810\nThis is a different approach with TLS.\n\n586\n00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:45.020\n&gt;&gt; I have a thought, but\nI'm trying not to interject here.\n\n587\n00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:48.210\nBut if I'm shopping,\nAdam, I've noticed that\n\n588\n00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:53.250\ndifferent websites will allow\nme to use HTTP without SSL.\n\n589\n00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:55.140\nOr TLS as I'm browsing the catalog and\n\n590\n00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:58.710\nonly switch over during that\ncheck-out process to help with speed.\n\n591\n00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:03.690\n&gt;&gt; It does, well, it helps the speed, but\nif you think about the logic, it's not so\n\n592\n00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:04.850\nmuch speed.\n\n593\n00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:09.066\nIt's more about the fact that\nyou don't need to encrypt and\n\n594\n00:27:09.066 --> 00:27:13.043\nlayer in the level of protection\nwe give you with HTTPS.\n\n595\n00:27:13.043 --> 00:27:16.240\n&gt;&gt; For all the shoot or else.\n&gt;&gt; SSL, TLS, whatever that backend is.\n\n596\n00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:20.390\nWe don't need that when you're browsing\nthe catalog and not exchanging client\n\n597\n00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:25.080\nspecific PII, personally identifiable\ninformation, PII is the acronym, right?\n\n598\n00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:29.093\nWhen you're not exposing your account\ninformation, credit card information, and\n\n599\n00:27:29.093 --> 00:27:32.505\nwhatever the case would be right,\nwhy would be bother encrypting that?\n\n600\n00:27:32.505 --> 00:27:35.673\nWhen all you're doing is looking at shoes,\nyou just don't really care.\n\n601\n00:27:35.673 --> 00:27:38.493\nBut when you go to check out,\nwe do then need to implement\n\n602\n00:27:38.493 --> 00:27:42.339\nthat encryption protection,\nthat bubble that's gonna envelop all that.\n\n603\n00:27:42.339 --> 00:27:43.898\n&gt;&gt; Yes, sir.\n\n604\n00:27:43.898 --> 00:27:45.790\n&gt;&gt; So at that point we do that.\n\n605\n00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:48.630\nIt is partly performance,\nthere certainly is a performance gain when\n\n606\n00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:51.250\nwe're not overlaying encryption\non top of everything.\n\n607\n00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:54.400\nBut it's also the fact that we just\ndon't really need that level of security\n\n608\n00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.868\nbecause you may not number one, buy.\n\n609\n00:27:55.868 --> 00:28:01.150\nAnd number two,\nit does complicate our ability to\n\n610\n00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:06.300\nbe able to move information back and forth\nthrough those systems in a timely way.\n\n611\n00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:09.180\nBut also for other things on\nthe backend that we're doing.\n\n612\n00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:12.320\nLogging, tracking,\na whole bunch of stuff that goes on and\n\n613\n00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.840\nit's usually easier to do\nthat when it's not encrypted.\n\n614\n00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.060\nSo as a result, it's easier for\n\n615\n00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:18.740\nus just to keep track of a lot of\nthat stuff without encryption.\n\n616\n00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:23.320\nAnd then when you do the gateway payment\nprocessing, because of PCI DSS and\n\n617\n00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:26.100\nother requirements that\nwe may have to follow.\n\n618\n00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:27.960\nWe have to implement encryption and\n\n619\n00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.070\nauthentication in order to\nvalidate that transaction.\n\n620\n00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:31.450\nThat's where we see it kick in.\n\n621\n00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:33.700\nNow some vendors just do HTTPS for\neverything.\n\n622\n00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:35.140\nThey just don't care, right?\n\n623\n00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:38.930\nSo again, it's not 100%,\neven if you're not buying something.\n\n624\n00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:41.590\nThere are certain websites\nyou'll go to that just start out\n\n625\n00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:43.530\nwith an encrypted secured connection.\n\n626\n00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:45.940\nEven if all you're doing is looking\nat publicly available information.\n\n627\n00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:48.890\nAnd they don't bother to deal\nwith the secure or not secure.\n\n628\n00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:50.260\nThey just do everything secure.\n\n629\n00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:54.690\nSo there isn't necessarily a always do\nit this way or else kinda mentality.\n\n630\n00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:57.570\nBut it is important for us to\nunderstand that there is a distinction.\n\n631\n00:28:57.570 --> 00:28:59.180\nAnd it's very good of\nyou to point that out.\n\n632\n00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:03.690\nBecause HTTP,\nnon secure traffic can be browsed.\n\n633\n00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:06.717\nEssentially it's like looking at can you\nspot my screen up for just a second?\n\n634\n00:29:06.717 --> 00:29:08.630\nIt would be essentially looking like this.\n\n635\n00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:10.060\nIf we did a network capture-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n636\n00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:13.000\n&gt;&gt; We would see this little description\nthat I'm showing you right now\n\n637\n00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.110\nhow TLS works.\n\n638\n00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:15.540\nYou would see this streaming.\n\n639\n00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:17.595\n&gt;&gt; The output of a program\nsuch as Wireshark.\n\n640\n00:29:17.595 --> 00:29:19.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you would see the bits and\n\n641\n00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:21.680\nyou have to put them together because\nobviously it's going to be packetized.\n\n642\n00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.080\nSo you're not gonna see a whole paragraph.\n\n643\n00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:23.720\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n644\n00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.510\n&gt;&gt; There'll be like five or\nten packets, but\n\n645\n00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:28.400\nyou'll be able to literally stitch them\ntogether and read it if you wanted to.\n\n646\n00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.250\nThe minute we overlay\nthe encryption with HTTPS,\n\n647\n00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:36.360\nthat becomes random garbled alphanumeric\noutput that looks like the matrix.\n\n648\n00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.800\nYou're not actually gonna read it or\nat least not be able to read it anyway.\n\n649\n00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.325\nSo that is an important distinction.\n\n650\n00:29:41.325 --> 00:29:43.195\nSo we said we would be negotiating, right?\n\n651\n00:29:43.195 --> 00:29:44.315\n&gt;&gt; That happens.\n&gt;&gt; We got up here, so\n\n652\n00:29:44.315 --> 00:29:46.645\nwe could talk through it real\nquick while we're talking.\n\n653\n00:29:46.645 --> 00:29:49.225\nWe're gonna negotiate, right,\nwhich is in the second and\n\n654\n00:29:49.225 --> 00:29:51.055\nthird sentence there, the handshake.\n\n655\n00:29:51.055 --> 00:29:54.535\nWe give out this list,\nboth of us, of the hashing and\n\n656\n00:29:54.535 --> 00:29:56.365\nencryption standards we support.\n\n657\n00:29:56.365 --> 00:30:00.345\nThis is where we're gonna get to\nessentially that lowest common denominator\n\n658\n00:30:00.345 --> 00:30:01.505\nthat I was talking about.\n\n659\n00:30:01.505 --> 00:30:04.352\nThe server which in our\nexample would be me.\n\n660\n00:30:04.352 --> 00:30:09.020\nI'm gonna pick that strongest\nlevel that we both support and\n\n661\n00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:13.290\nthen I'm going to implement that and\nuse that to communicate.\n\n662\n00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:17.230\nAnd I'm going to notify you and say okay,\nCherokee, we had four options, we both\n\n663\n00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:23.270\nsupport options one, two, and three,\nI only support four, so we can't use four.\n\n664\n00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:25.920\nStrongest is three,\none being the lowest and three,\n\n665\n00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.350\nfour being the highest\nLet's go with three.\n\n666\n00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:28.910\nWhatever three is.\n\n667\n00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:31.820\nIt doesn't matter what it is,\nbut let's go with three, right?\n\n668\n00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:35.780\nSo then I'm gonna say, the server is\ngonna say, this is the strongest one and\n\n669\n00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:36.770\ninform the client.\n\n670\n00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:38.200\nThis is what we're using.\n\n671\n00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.190\nSo the server is gonna make the choice.\n\n672\n00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:44.380\nWe notify the clients so\nnow you're gonna say okay no problem.\n\n673\n00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:45.920\nCherokee's got money burning\na hole in her pocket.\n\n674\n00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.000\nShe wants to buy a pretty pair of shoes.\n\n675\n00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.060\nSo we're then gonna go ahead and\nwe're going to validate that, so\n\n676\n00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:54.260\nwe have some certificates going back and\nforth, right?\n\n677\n00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:57.931\nSo we send our certificates back and\nforth to identify ourselves.\n\n678\n00:30:57.931 --> 00:31:02.108\nX509 certificates as we call out there and\nthen we're going to and\n\n679\n00:31:02.108 --> 00:31:04.700\nthis is the instant part about TLS.\n\n680\n00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:05.880\nWe're going to encrypt.\n\n681\n00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.280\nYou're going to encrypt the client.\n\n682\n00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:11.140\nIt's going to encrypt the random number\nwith the server's public key and\n\n683\n00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:13.140\nsend the result back from the server.\n\n684\n00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:16.020\nSo you're gonna take my public key\nfrom the server when I send you\n\n685\n00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:18.360\nthe certificate,\nyou gonna have my public key.\n\n686\n00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:22.115\nYou're gonna take my public key, you're\ngonna take a randomly generated number.\n\n687\n00:31:22.115 --> 00:31:26.190\nWe've talked about PRNG, pseudo random\nnumber generators and how that works.\n\n688\n00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:27.800\nYour gonna generate a random number,\n\n689\n00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:32.230\nyour gonna encrypt that whole thing,\nthe certificate information.\n\n690\n00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:33.949\n&gt;&gt; Plus the number.\n&gt;&gt; With the random number and\n\n691\n00:31:33.949 --> 00:31:35.970\nyour gonna send it back to me.\n\n692\n00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:39.435\nBut since you use my public key, I'm\nthe only one that can decrypt it because I\n\n693\n00:31:39.435 --> 00:31:41.100\nused my corresponding private key.\n\n694\n00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:43.104\nMr. and Mrs. Asymmetric right here, right.\n\n695\n00:31:43.104 --> 00:31:47.561\nSo I'm gonna use my private key as\nthe server, I'm gonna decrypt that.\n\n696\n00:31:47.561 --> 00:31:52.182\nAnd then I'm gonna take that information\nand I'm gonna generate key material that\n\n697\n00:31:52.182 --> 00:31:56.220\nwill then be used, that we both have\naccess to, to encrypt and decrypt.\n\n698\n00:31:56.220 --> 00:32:00.460\nBecause we both now have the random\nnumber that's used as a seed value,\n\n699\n00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:01.980\nto be able to generate our keys.\n\n700\n00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:04.890\n&gt;&gt; Perhaps we use Diffie–Hellman for\nthat key exchange negotiation?\n\n701\n00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:07.073\n&gt;&gt; We could use a variety\nof different things for it.\n\n702\n00:32:07.073 --> 00:32:10.386\nIt may or may not be Diffie-Hellman, just\ndepending on how we're implementing it.\n\n703\n00:32:10.386 --> 00:32:11.912\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But the idea is that we're\n\n704\n00:32:11.912 --> 00:32:14.884\ngonna use that random number\nthought process, to move a seed\n\n705\n00:32:14.884 --> 00:32:18.850\nvalue that's gonna become essentially\na known secret between the two of us.\n\n706\n00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:21.045\nWe're gonna use that to start to\ninitializing the generation of our keys.\n\n707\n00:32:21.045 --> 00:32:22.020\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n&gt;&gt; So it's actually kind of\n\n708\n00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:23.200\ninteresting, right?\n\n709\n00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.690\nBecause that allows us to bring together\nthe thought process of asymmetric\n\n710\n00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:30.880\nencryption, and the thought process of\nnot only using asymmetric encryption but\n\n711\n00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:32.770\na handshake that will negotiate.\n\n712\n00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:37.620\nAnd therefore establish the strongest\nover protection supported between\n\n713\n00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:39.750\nthe two parties using\ndigital certificates.\n\n714\n00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:43.740\nSo the exchange of the public key through\nthe ex 5 online certificate standard.\n\n715\n00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:48.050\nAnd then the use of that seed value, that\nrandomization, what we refer to as the IV,\n\n716\n00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:49.600\nthe initialization vector.\n\n717\n00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.860\nThat's securely transmitted, so\nthat nobody else knows what it is,\n\n718\n00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:55.440\nto establish a secure communication\nin what we call the session.\n\n719\n00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.198\nAnd that's what's then ultimately\nused to allow us to encrypt and\n\n720\n00:32:58.198 --> 00:32:59.650\nto securely communicate.\n\n721\n00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:01.890\n&gt;&gt; Adam if you wanted to broaden\nthat a little bit further and\n\n722\n00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:05.720\nhave additional options, that's where EAP,\nit would come into play there.\n\n723\n00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.680\nWe could use EAP TLS if we had other\nmechanisms, like you mentioned,\n\n724\n00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.900\nlike that RSA token or\nsomething like that.\n\n725\n00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:15.230\n&gt;&gt; So if we wanted to add additional or\ndifferent layers of authentication,\n\n726\n00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:17.320\nwe could implement them through EAP.\n\n727\n00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:21.770\nAs I mentioned, TLS is actually\nimplemented as EAP with TLS,\n\n728\n00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:23.450\nas one possible thought process.\n\n729\n00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:26.610\nSo we do see that being used,\nor potentially being used.\n\n730\n00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:28.820\nSo there are other ways EAP can\nbe brought to bear and used.\n\n731\n00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:31.868\nIt's not just with TLS,\nas I said, it's with smart cards.\n\n732\n00:33:31.868 --> 00:33:34.793\nBut EAP with TLS is actually\nhow we use smart cards,\n\n733\n00:33:34.793 --> 00:33:37.430\nthat's the actual mechanism we use for\nsmart cards.\n\n734\n00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:40.610\nBecause that's specific to\nthe digital certificate exchange,\n\n735\n00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:42.430\nwhich is what typically\nsmart cards are used for.\n\n736\n00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:45.920\nThey gonna have your certificate or your\nkeys embedded in them and that's how we\n\n737\n00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:49.230\ntranslate the certificate, and exchange\nthem through the use of VAP or TLS.\n\n738\n00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:52.080\nThat's exactly how we would do it,\nand least in that one case, anyway,\n\n739\n00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.340\nthat's what we would do.\n\n740\n00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:54.550\nAbsolutely correct.\n\n741\n00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:55.880\n&gt;&gt; What's next on our list here?\n\n742\n00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.730\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nif you're gonna let me go over time,\n\n743\n00:33:57.730 --> 00:33:59.509\nwe could talk about all\nsorts of cool VPN stuff.\n\n744\n00:33:59.509 --> 00:34:00.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n745\n00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:00.940\n&gt;&gt; But if you're not,\n\n746\n00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:03.100\nthen you're gonna wait for\nme to talk about that on the next episode.\n\n747\n00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:04.840\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna make me be\nthe Debbie Downer here.\n\n748\n00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:05.590\nThat's all right.\n\n749\n00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:07.100\n&gt;&gt; No, no.\nI'm just simply pointing out that-\n\n750\n00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:08.090\n&gt;&gt; We are out of time.\n\n751\n00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:09.180\n&gt;&gt; We are out of time.\n\n752\n00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:12.101\nAnd while we always wanna keep going and\ntalk to you about all the cool stuff,\n\n753\n00:34:12.101 --> 00:34:13.325\nwe don't wanna get yelled at.\n\n754\n00:34:13.325 --> 00:34:17.100\n[LAUGH] So, we're gonna stop and\ncomeback in another episode.\n\n755\n00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:19.462\nBut in that upcoming episode, just so\nyou know, we're gonna talk about VPN, so\n\n756\n00:34:19.462 --> 00:34:21.252\nthat's gonna one of the [CROSSTALK]\nthings or stuff to get to.\n\n757\n00:34:21.252 --> 00:34:23.040\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n758\n00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:25.987\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna talk about EFS, the\nEncrypting File System in BitLocker, so\n\n759\n00:34:25.987 --> 00:34:27.170\nwe'll talk a bit about that.\n\n760\n00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:32.370\nWe're also probably gonna talk\nabout the NSA Crypto Suite.\n\n761\n00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:36.590\nSuite A and Suite B and\nhow the algorithms were graded by NSA.\n\n762\n00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:39.100\nAnd how we are actually able to use\nthem and consume them publicly.\n\n763\n00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:40.640\nWe'll give you a little insights and\nall that,\n\n764\n00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:42.375\nthat will be in the upcoming episode.\n\n765\n00:34:42.375 --> 00:34:42.975\nAll right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n766\n00:34:42.975 --> 00:34:46.025\n&gt;&gt; And you don't have to have your\ntop secret clearance for that either,\n\n767\n00:34:46.025 --> 00:34:48.115\nwe're just gonna go ahead and\ncontinue on here.\n\n768\n00:34:48.115 --> 00:34:50.465\nSo, stay tuned,\nwe're gonna sign off for this show.\n\n769\n00:34:50.465 --> 00:34:52.155\nRemember I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n770\n00:34:52.155 --> 00:34:53.045\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n771\n00:34:53.045 --> 00:34:54.683\n&gt;&gt; See you next time at IT Pro TV.\n\n772\n00:34:56.627 --> 00:35:02.560\n[MUSIC]\n\n773\n00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:05.401\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:08.270\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.582\nYou're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.582 --> 00:00:13.432\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your ECES series.\n\n6\n00:00:13.432 --> 00:00:16.060\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.133\nThis is actually a continuation of\na previous episode, I should say now.\n\n8\n00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:23.190\nWhere we're continuing to look\nat applications of cryptography.\n\n9\n00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.500\nWith us today,\nwe have Mr Adam Gordon in studios.\n\n10\n00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.265\nThank you for joining us Adam.\n\n11\n00:00:27.265 --> 00:00:27.985\n&gt;&gt; Hi.\n\n12\n00:00:27.985 --> 00:00:30.921\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Hi.\n\n13\n00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:31.588\n&gt;&gt; It was, just hi.\n\n14\n00:00:31.588 --> 00:00:32.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right.\n\n15\n00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.490\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n16\n00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.030\nSo I am here, you are here, hopefully.\n\n17\n00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.360\nHopefully we are here together.\n\n18\n00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.170\nAnd Cherokee is here, which means we\ngonna have a very fun, exciting and\n\n19\n00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.320\nrandom conversation.\n\n20\n00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.470\nI have a feeling about VPNs.\n\n21\n00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.928\nSo let's talk about VPN, some other\nthings, let's talk about VPNs, EFS,\n\n22\n00:00:46.928 --> 00:00:50.427\nBitlocker as I mentioned in\nthe outro of our prior episodes,\n\n23\n00:00:50.427 --> 00:00:52.569\nif you haven't seen that by the way.\n\n24\n00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:57.261\nWe've talked a lot about the practical\napplications of cryptography\n\n25\n00:00:57.261 --> 00:01:02.031\nfrom various levels and various points,\nwe've gone deeply into PKI,\n\n26\n00:01:02.031 --> 00:01:07.758\ndeeply into certificates, talked about\ndigital signatures, talked about the ways\n\n27\n00:01:07.758 --> 00:01:13.355\nin which our certificates are structured,\ntalked about certificate life cycle.\n\n28\n00:01:13.355 --> 00:01:18.441\nWe've spoken about how wireless\nencryption is carried out,\n\n29\n00:01:18.441 --> 00:01:25.103\ndifferent standards that we use there,\nWEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA2 Enterprise.\n\n30\n00:01:25.103 --> 00:01:29.592\nWe talked about a lot of different things\nthat are building blocks that continue\n\n31\n00:01:29.592 --> 00:01:34.283\nto expand our knowledge and our thought\nprocesses around how we apply cryptography\n\n32\n00:01:34.283 --> 00:01:37.205\nin the real world,\nin all of these prior episodes.\n\n33\n00:01:37.205 --> 00:01:39.050\nI'm not saying you have to\nnecessarily go back and\n\n34\n00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.660\nwatch them in order, but\njust indicating that\n\n35\n00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.220\nwe're picking up on themes that we've\ntalked about in those other episodes here.\n\n36\n00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.580\nAnd so we just wanna make sure you're\ncomfortable with where all that knowledge\n\n37\n00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.240\nis coming from.\n\n38\n00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.940\nAnd if you're not sure about something,\nalways invite you to go back and\n\n39\n00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:51.810\ntake a look.\n\n40\n00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.460\nCome on back when you've seen it and\npick us back up here,\n\n41\n00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.160\nand we'll be happy to continue\nthis conversation with you.\n\n42\n00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.180\nSo let's talk about VPNs,\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n43\n00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.040\n&gt;&gt; And what they are.\n\n44\n00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.010\nSo if I asked you to give us a high level\ndefinition of what a VPN is, what would\n\n45\n00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.610\nyou tell our kind folk in studio\naudience land out there for IT Pro TV?\n\n46\n00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.990\nHow would we describe what a VPN\nis to somebody if they asked us?\n\n47\n00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.060\nWhat would you tell them?\n\n48\n00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.020\n&gt;&gt; All right, I would try to work\nthe word tunneling in there,\n\n49\n00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.250\nbecause they probably read it or heard\nit or seen it in some context already.\n\n50\n00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.693\nSo tunneling is kind of establishing\nan end to end communication.\n\n51\n00:02:25.693 --> 00:02:30.789\nVPN's are a more modern approach\nto having a private connection,\n\n52\n00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:35.440\nwhether it be from site to host,\nhost to host, site to site.\n\n53\n00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.860\nBut it's a way that I can communicate\nover a public network privately.\n\n54\n00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.230\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so like that.\n\n55\n00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.010\nThe way we can communicate over\na public network privately.\n\n56\n00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.890\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; It's a great wat of thinking about VPN.\n\n57\n00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.950\nWe bring tunneling in there and\nwe're gonna talk about tunneling here,\n\n58\n00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.800\nwith some of the protocols\nthat work with VPNs.\n\n59\n00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.050\nBut the idea of being able to extend that\nprivate network through a public network.\n\n60\n00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.610\nBut to do so securely through a tunnel\nis the mechanism, the thought process,\n\n61\n00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.190\nthe underlying reasons why VPNs are so\nimportant to us, and have been for many,\n\n62\n00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.370\nmany years now.\n\n63\n00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.775\nBecause we need that capability to be able\nto reach into our private networks from\n\n64\n00:03:10.775 --> 00:03:15.310\noutside and access data, content,\nmaterial, information, variety of forms in\n\n65\n00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.108\na way that will not expose it to people\nthat are not supposed to see it.\n\n66\n00:03:19.108 --> 00:03:23.540\nSo doing that over the public network is\nexactly what VPNs are designed to do.\n\n67\n00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.080\nWe do have common protocols, all of them\nwill revolve around using tunneling in\n\n68\n00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.500\nsome way, as you described,\nthat we could use to set up VPNs.\n\n69\n00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.960\nWe often think about things, like, PPTP,\nPoint-to-Point Tunneling Protocol,\n\n70\n00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.030\nan oldie, but a goodie, although we\ndon't tend to use it as much anymore.\n\n71\n00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.905\nWe think about L2TP,\nLayer 2 Tunneling Protocol.\n\n72\n00:03:40.905 --> 00:03:43.603\nWe've got an interesting little\nconversation, we'll have about that.\n\n73\n00:03:43.603 --> 00:03:44.739\nNot as interesting and\n\n74\n00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.505\nobvious as some people make it out to\nbe because the interesting thing about\n\n75\n00:03:48.505 --> 00:03:51.700\nL2TP is that it actually does\nnothing to encrypt our traffic.\n\n76\n00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.890\nThat is only an authentication.\n\n77\n00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.370\nI think it is nothing more than that.\n\n78\n00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.220\nPeople don't often realize that and\nwhen we talk about L2TP, we have to talk\n\n79\n00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.050\nabout it in respect to IPsec and\nyou'll often hear almost that exception.\n\n80\n00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.850\nYou always hear.\n\n81\n00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.202\nPeople say I'm using an L2TP with or\nplus, or someway indicating that they're\n\n82\n00:04:09.202 --> 00:04:12.082\nadding IPsec to the mix VPN\nbecause we can't really,\n\n83\n00:04:12.082 --> 00:04:15.282\nalthough technically we could\ndo an L2TP tunnel for VPN and\n\n84\n00:04:15.282 --> 00:04:19.634\nwe would certainly be able to establish\na communication channel it would miss and\n\n85\n00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:23.540\nbe lacking the one fundamental thing\nthat Cherokee described you need.\n\n86\n00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.297\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you could create it but\nthat's kind of the point, right?\n\n87\n00:04:26.297 --> 00:04:29.370\nWell,-\n&gt;&gt; Most people wanna have that encryption\n\n88\n00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.261\nwith their-\n&gt;&gt; You need not just the authentication,\n\n89\n00:04:31.261 --> 00:04:32.293\nyou need the encryption.\n\n90\n00:04:32.293 --> 00:04:32.997\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n91\n00:04:32.997 --> 00:04:37.180\nthe whole idea of a VPN would be\nlost if we just did L2TP by itself.\n\n92\n00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.370\nSo, we break out IPSec separately and\nsay, and by the way, we also use IPSec.\n\n93\n00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.510\nBut really, you never see L2TP\nimplemented without IPsec.\n\n94\n00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.478\nSo, it's really an L2TP plus IPsec VPN.\n\n95\n00:04:48.478 --> 00:04:50.750\nSo just wanna think about that and\nbe aware of that.\n\n96\n00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.690\nSo these are the common tunneling\nprotocols that are used.\n\n97\n00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.275\nSo let's talk about PPTP and where it\ncomes from historically for a minute.\n\n98\n00:04:57.275 --> 00:05:03.100\nPoint-to-Point-Tunneling Protocol\nworks at layer 2 as L2TP does as well.\n\n99\n00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.440\nLayer 2 of the OSI model,\nthe data link layer.\n\n100\n00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.760\nThey both work at layer\n2 of the OSI model.\n\n101\n00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.640\nTake a slightly different approach to how\nthey populate and therefore how they work.\n\n102\n00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.970\nBut, both work at layer 2.\n\n103\n00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.330\nPPTP provides both authentication and\nencryption capabilities.\n\n104\n00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.580\nSo, it does natively encrypt,\nunlike L2TP, which does not.\n\n105\n00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.623\nWe use EAP,\nour friend from our last episode,\n\n106\n00:05:25.623 --> 00:05:29.685\nExtensible Authentication Protocol\nand/or CHAP to provide\n\n107\n00:05:29.685 --> 00:05:31.723\nthe authentication for PPTP.\n\n108\n00:05:31.723 --> 00:05:35.300\nSo we use some of the prior authentication\nprotocols we've spoken about.\n\n109\n00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.530\nAnd on the encryption side or\nthe confidentiality side of PPTP,\n\n110\n00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.700\nwe use MPPE,\nMicrosoft Point to Point Encryption.\n\n111\n00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:49.550\nAnd MPPE is actually a Microsoft\nspecific implementation of DES.\n\n112\n00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.150\nSo they actually take DES and\n\n113\n00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.510\nthey actually had wizards at Microsoft,\nyears ago.\n\n114\n00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.820\nTook DES, modified it, implemented\nit in a slightly different guise and\n\n115\n00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.430\ncalled it MPPE.\n\n116\n00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.470\nAnd we only, only, only, only,\nvery important to stress,\n\n117\n00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.860\nonly can use PPTP over\nstandard IP network.\n\n118\n00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.280\nMeaning standard traditional\nethernet network, no problem.\n\n119\n00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.620\nBut unlike L2TP which is more flexible and\n\n120\n00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.850\naffords us additional connection\nnetwork topology capabilities.\n\n121\n00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.170\nI got it right this time, right?\n\n122\n00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.900\nSo X.25, ATM, frame,\n\n123\n00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.650\nyou may or may not be familiar with\nthese particular network types.\n\n124\n00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.445\nBut if you're not, I'm sure we have some\ninteresting conversations that we can have\n\n125\n00:06:29.445 --> 00:06:31.087\nthrough Network+, for instance.\n\n126\n00:06:31.087 --> 00:06:35.310\nOf course we'll look at some of\nthe episodes and shows we have there.\n\n127\n00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.840\nProbably any of the introductory Cisco\nmaterial we have at ITPRO.TV in our\n\n128\n00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.810\nlibrary around CCENT and or CCNA would\nprovide a good overview of Frame,\n\n129\n00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.300\nATM and\nall sorts of other stuff including X25.\n\n130\n00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.240\nX25 is kind of an oldy used on\ntelepathy systems more often than not.\n\n131\n00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.189\nBut we certainly do see other network\nconnectivity types needed and\n\n132\n00:06:56.189 --> 00:07:00.076\nPPTP would not be supported there,\nonly on standard IP networks.\n\n133\n00:07:00.076 --> 00:07:03.600\nL2TP can be used to create VPNs\nacross these other network types, so\n\n134\n00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.381\nit is more flexible which kind of\ninteresting so we wanna be aware of that.\n\n135\n00:07:07.381 --> 00:07:09.868\nBut L2TP, as I talked about,\nis actually, and\n\n136\n00:07:09.868 --> 00:07:12.900\nthere's another thing\npeople don't often know.\n\n137\n00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:18.520\nL2TP is actually PPTP combined with\na Cisco proprietary protocol called L2F,,\n\n138\n00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.790\nLayer 2 Forwarding, which is why we firmly\nanchor it at Layer 2 of the OSI model.\n\n139\n00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:27.700\nAnd so, we combine L2F and PPTP together,\nand as a result we get what's commonly now\n\n140\n00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:33.030\nreferred to as L2TP, but without\nencryption capabilities without IPsec.\n\n141\n00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:34.270\nAnd so we often, as we said,\n\n142\n00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:38.640\nwe'll refer to L2TP with IPsec\nwhen we talk about VPNs.\n\n143\n00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:43.720\nLayer 2 of the OSI model, we combine\nPPTP and Cisco's L2F protocol together.\n\n144\n00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:48.446\nWe do get additional methods that\nare available to us for authentication.\n\n145\n00:07:48.446 --> 00:07:53.694\nRemember PPTP uses either EAP,\nExtensible Authentication Protocol, and\n\n146\n00:07:53.694 --> 00:08:00.011\nor CHAP, not MS-CHAP, not Microsoft CHAP,\nbut CHAP Generically to do authentication.\n\n147\n00:08:00.011 --> 00:08:04.690\nWe get those two mechanisms without TTP,\nbut we also get others.\n\n148\n00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:07.810\nWe get in addition to that we also get,\n\n149\n00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.660\nwhat do we get, we get PAP,\nSPAP and we get MS-CHAP.\n\n150\n00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:16.770\nSo we actually do bring in\nMS-CHAP Microsoft specific CHAP with L2TP.\n\n151\n00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:20.470\nSo we're blending Microsoft, Sysco,\nand all this stuff in a blender, and\n\n152\n00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:23.580\nwe pour it out, and\nyou get L2TP without IPsec.\n\n153\n00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.090\nAnd when we add IPsec,\n\n154\n00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:28.020\nwe get the additional capability\nto be able to then bring in\n\n155\n00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:32.980\nthe encryption mechanisms required to\nprovide confidentiality for that VPN.\n\n156\n00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:36.870\nSo L2TP VPNs with IPsec\nadd that capability.\n\n157\n00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:41.420\nAnd then we have a fourth type of VPN or\nif you think of L2TP with IPsec together,\n\n158\n00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:42.405\nwould be a third type.\n\n159\n00:08:42.405 --> 00:08:45.240\nIf you broke IPsec out separately,\nit'd be a fourth type.\n\n160\n00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:49.293\nUp to you to decide, but\nPPTP, L2TP with IPsec,\n\n161\n00:08:49.293 --> 00:08:52.778\nthird type would then an SSL and\nor TLS VPN.\n\n162\n00:08:52.778 --> 00:08:53.723\nWe talked about SSL and\n\n163\n00:08:53.723 --> 00:08:56.980\nTLS in our last discussion in the last\ndiscussion in the last episode.\n\n164\n00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:00.339\nThis allows us to establish VPNs\nvia the web through a web browser.\n\n165\n00:09:00.339 --> 00:09:02.037\n&gt;&gt; Lightweight.\n\n166\n00:09:02.037 --> 00:09:05.255\n&gt;&gt; Lightweight and gets rid of\nthe overhead of separate application,\n\n167\n00:09:05.255 --> 00:09:06.949\nconfiguration required for that,\n\n168\n00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:10.130\nhelp desk support to maintain\nthat when people screw it up.\n\n169\n00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:11.850\nSo it is a little bit easier to do.\n\n170\n00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:13.670\nIt's very common today.\n\n171\n00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:16.850\nMany, many people are using,\nthey actually call it VPNless VPNs,\n\n172\n00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:17.620\nwhich is kinda silly.\n\n173\n00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:18.990\nBut that's what they call it.\n\n174\n00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:22.010\nBut it's an application less VPN,\nmeaning you don't need a client.\n\n175\n00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:23.960\nYou simply use a standard web browser or\n\n176\n00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.845\na web capable program that could\nsupport SSL-TLS transactions.\n\n177\n00:09:27.845 --> 00:09:30.735\nAnd then we establish a secure\ntunnel as we talked about in\n\n178\n00:09:30.735 --> 00:09:32.355\nthe prior episode to do that.\n\n179\n00:09:32.355 --> 00:09:36.415\nAnd through the negotiation and\nthe standardization of the authentication\n\n180\n00:09:36.415 --> 00:09:38.655\nencryption mechanism\nlowest common denominator.\n\n181\n00:09:38.655 --> 00:09:42.515\nWith TLS, we set up a secure communication\nchannel and that's how the VPN runs.\n\n182\n00:09:42.515 --> 00:09:46.005\nSo, those are our main VPN types and\nthe way in which they will work..\n\n183\n00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:49.776\nAny thoughts, questions,\ncomments, concerns,\n\n184\n00:09:49.776 --> 00:09:53.664\nplease send them in [INAUDIBLE] here,\naddress them to Cherokee at ITProTV.\n\n185\n00:09:53.664 --> 00:09:54.170\nAll right.\n\n186\n00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:59.160\nSo just kidding around but any questions\nabout VPNs, something you wanna add?\n\n187\n00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.750\n&gt;&gt; I haven't really used a lot\nof the VPN services that\n\n188\n00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:03.520\nare readily available online.\n\n189\n00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.710\nAnd it might be something to consider\nreally investigating one before you choose\n\n190\n00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:12.130\nto do so if you're not setting that up\nin-house and you're using a third-party.\n\n191\n00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:14.820\nBecause I've seen articles where certain,\n\n192\n00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:19.270\nnot all governments are,\nhow do I say this?\n\n193\n00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:23.610\nSometimes governments can request\nrecords from a particular company and\n\n194\n00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:24.370\nthey either have to.\n\n195\n00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:27.630\nThey're looking at how long,\nsometimes people want that anonymity\n\n196\n00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:32.570\nthese VPN services will have to forfeit or\n\n197\n00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:35.710\nrelinquish these logs to\ndifferent government entities.\n\n198\n00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:39.690\nBut some of these VPN services\nclaim not to maintain logs,\n\n199\n00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:41.780\nso they can't forfeit them.\n\n200\n00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:46.122\nSo do your homework before you choose the\nVPN service if you are using a provider.\n\n201\n00:10:46.122 --> 00:10:49.163\nMaybe that would be only suggestion there.\n\n202\n00:10:49.163 --> 00:10:54.220\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n203\n00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:55.540\nso I was just waiting on you to finish.\n\n204\n00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:59.360\nSo it is Cherokee brings out some really\nreally important point about this,\n\n205\n00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:04.070\nwhich is that we tend to take for granted\nwhen we're talking about cryptography.\n\n206\n00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:08.910\nThe idea that because we attach that word,\nwe encrypt our data which you\n\n207\n00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:12.610\nsay one of VPN is essentially is designed\nto do the most important element of it.\n\n208\n00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:15.802\nThat because we encrypt our data,\nthat it's gonna be secure forever.\n\n209\n00:11:15.802 --> 00:11:18.570\nWe're gonna transmit it securely and\nit's always gonna be secure.\n\n210\n00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:22.210\nAnd that couldn't be anything further from\nthe case to be quite honest with you.\n\n211\n00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:25.780\nCherokee was quite polite about it,\nlet me be non-politically correct and\n\n212\n00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:28.540\njust come right out and say it,\ncuz I don't really care who I offend.\n\n213\n00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:33.010\nThe reality is that many entities,\nprimarily governments and\n\n214\n00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:36.240\ncertainly three letter acronym\nagencies that work for them.\n\n215\n00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:41.900\nHave the capability and in many cases\nperhaps the necessity and need, either\n\n216\n00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:46.630\nthrough some sort of a law or because\nof other situations and circumstances.\n\n217\n00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:49.820\nTo show up proverbially on the door\nstep of these technology vendors,\n\n218\n00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:50.980\nas you were suggesting.\n\n219\n00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:58.650\nAnd politely or otherwise, encourage\nthem to give information up to show log,\n\n220\n00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:03.600\nand perhaps also give access to data\nstreams, either in real time or recorded.\n\n221\n00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.700\nOf transactions that may be occurring,\nhave occurred,\n\n222\n00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:10.880\nor positioned themselves to monitor\nthem when they will occur in the future.\n\n223\n00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.790\nAnd I'm not suggesting and\nI wanna be clear about this and\n\n224\n00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:15.810\nI talk about this in other episodes and\nin other shows.\n\n225\n00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:20.160\nYou have to understand a couple of things\nabout the rules of engagement today\n\n226\n00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.320\nin our world if you use anything\nthat is gonna be bits and bytes and\n\n227\n00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.750\nit's transmitted digitally.\n\n228\n00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:28.500\nYou have to assume number one,\nno matter how big your protection,\n\n229\n00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.800\nno matter how good the encryption,\nno matter how careful you are.\n\n230\n00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.990\nThat if somebody wants to listen in and\n\n231\n00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:37.360\nrecord what you are doing\nThey will find a way to it.\n\n232\n00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:41.450\nYou have to assume in other words\nthat everything you do electronically\n\n233\n00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:43.865\nis potentially subject to monitoring.\n\n234\n00:12:43.865 --> 00:12:44.960\nWhether it is or not,\n\n235\n00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.120\nI am not suggesting you look over your\nshoulder, that you look under rocks and\n\n236\n00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:52.550\nthat you see people with dark sunglasses,\nright, there all the time.\n\n237\n00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:56.480\nBut you do have to understand\nthat the technology\n\n238\n00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:01.200\nthat exists today that allows\nus to envision these solutions.\n\n239\n00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.190\nThere is equally impressive technology on\nthe other side of that divide that allows\n\n240\n00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:10.550\nus to, in many cases, get around those\nsolutions in one form or another.\n\n241\n00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:15.160\nAnd we continue to see disclosures on this\nin some cases daily; certainly weekly,\n\n242\n00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.740\nmonthly, yearly basis.\n\n243\n00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.970\nOver the last number of years about just\nthe shenanigans that governments get up to\n\n244\n00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:21.490\nbehind the scenes with this stuff.\n\n245\n00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:24.730\nAnd the partnerships that are created\nwith technology companies and\n\n246\n00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:29.680\nall the things that go on in order to\nfacilitate this access at many points\n\n247\n00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.510\nin that transmission chain.\n\n248\n00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:34.110\nYou cannot assume as\na security professional,\n\n249\n00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:38.410\nas a certified ethical hacker,\nas a certified forensics investigator.\n\n250\n00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:41.670\nCertainly as a certified\nencryption specialist\n\n251\n00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:45.030\nas anything that has to do with IT or\nsecurity today.\n\n252\n00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:50.070\nThat just because you send it securely\nmeans that it's gonna stay secure forever.\n\n253\n00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:53.230\nAnd as a result of that,\nyou have to think about and\n\n254\n00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:55.330\ngive good counsel to the people\nwho are relying on you.\n\n255\n00:13:55.330 --> 00:14:00.230\nAnd think about the fact that information\nthat should not see the light of day\n\n256\n00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:03.790\nmay not necessarily be able to\nbe transmitted electronically.\n\n257\n00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:06.960\nAnd we may have to go to the alternate\nsystems and alternate mechanisms.\n\n258\n00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:10.570\nTo be able to securely transmit that data,\nstore it, maintain it, and\n\n259\n00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:15.040\nuse it in situations where there\nis legitimate questionable\n\n260\n00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.550\nactivity that can go on that\nmay expose this information.\n\n261\n00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:22.670\nI don't want you to think for a minute,\nas you listen to us, as you hear us chat,\n\n262\n00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:23.920\nas we chat with you.\n\n263\n00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.830\nThat everything you do is automatically\ngonna be recorded in some massive\n\n264\n00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:30.360\ndata sink in the sky somewhere.\n\n265\n00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.620\nThere maybe evidence of your transactions,\nbut\n\n266\n00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:34.150\nthat doesn't mean\nsomebody's looking at them.\n\n267\n00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:39.430\nAnd simply means that they maybe captured\nas part of a much broader thought process.\n\n268\n00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:44.010\nBut if you're not doing anything, that\nanybody feels as worthy of inspection,\n\n269\n00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:46.350\nthen there may not be any reasons for\nthem to look at it.\n\n270\n00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:48.500\nThat may or\nmay not give you comfort and may or\n\n271\n00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.260\nmay not let you sleep well at night.\n\n272\n00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.600\nBut the point is ultimately that\nyou have to assume as a security\n\n273\n00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.720\nprofessional today.\n\n274\n00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.860\nThat somewhere, somehow,\n\n275\n00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:59.625\nsomebody at some point in time is\nmonitoring that communication.\n\n276\n00:14:59.625 --> 00:15:02.515\nAnd they may or\nmay not be able to get the essence of that\n\n277\n00:15:02.515 --> 00:15:04.795\ninformation by decrypting it,\nwe've talked about this.\n\n278\n00:15:04.795 --> 00:15:06.155\nAnd if you're smart and\n\n279\n00:15:06.155 --> 00:15:11.315\nyou apply very strong cryptographic\nprotections to your transmissions.\n\n280\n00:15:11.315 --> 00:15:15.645\nThe average individual, the average bad\nactor, is not gonna be able to decode that\n\n281\n00:15:15.645 --> 00:15:18.020\ninformation in a reasonable\namount of time.\n\n282\n00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:21.210\nBut you also have to understand that\ngovernments are not average actors.\n\n283\n00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:25.690\nAnd that entities that have those\ncapabilities, those resources, and\n\n284\n00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:27.890\nthose tools are not average.\n\n285\n00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:32.530\nAnd that they can bring to bear\ninformation management solutions,\n\n286\n00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:36.170\ntechnology, resources,\nthat we may have no knowledge of.\n\n287\n00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:39.740\nAnd that may be able to break even\nthe strongest commercially available,\n\n288\n00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:43.670\npublicly available encryption in\nminutes and we just don't know.\n\n289\n00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:45.580\nI mean the government was able to hack,\n\n290\n00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.710\nnot that the iPhone is the ultimate\nend all be all in encryption.\n\n291\n00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:52.630\nBut clearly the FBI in the last couple\nof years was able to go in and hack\n\n292\n00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:57.376\ninto the Apple security solution and break\niPhone encryption to see information.\n\n293\n00:15:57.376 --> 00:16:00.139\nWell publicized case, took place in 2016.\n\n294\n00:16:00.139 --> 00:16:01.823\nSo you may or may not be aware of that.\n\n295\n00:16:01.823 --> 00:16:05.284\nThere's ample evidence of not\nonly the American government, but\n\n296\n00:16:05.284 --> 00:16:09.550\nmultiple governments around the world,\neavesdropping on their own citizens and\n\n297\n00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:12.639\nothers, and using technology\nthat has not been known about\n\n298\n00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:14.951\nuntil it has been outed\nin some form to do so.\n\n299\n00:16:14.951 --> 00:16:20.471\nThere was recent discussion in the early\npart of 2017 around the fact that the NSA,\n\n300\n00:16:20.471 --> 00:16:24.267\nthe CIA in particular,\nhave many tools and capabilities.\n\n301\n00:16:24.267 --> 00:16:28.692\nIt came out through WikiLinks that\nthere are many tools that are used to\n\n302\n00:16:28.692 --> 00:16:33.225\ninterdict and to grab that traffic\nbefore it actually gets encrypted.\n\n303\n00:16:33.225 --> 00:16:36.570\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Well, what we're seeing is,\n\n304\n00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:40.207\nit's interesting when you look at\nwhat comes out through WikiLinks and\n\n305\n00:16:40.207 --> 00:16:43.290\nthen you read the expert\ndebunking of all this stuff.\n\n306\n00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:47.248\nSo it's interesting that all the tools,\nthe majority of them anyway, that came out\n\n307\n00:16:47.248 --> 00:16:52.460\nthrough latest Wikileaks exposure of\nCIA methods in the first quarter or\n\n308\n00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:57.930\nso of 2017, that the majority of those\ntools are actually incredibly simplistic,\n\n309\n00:16:57.930 --> 00:16:59.900\nwhen you go back and\nlook at what was talked about.\n\n310\n00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.920\nAnd almost without exception,\nall those mechanisms and\n\n311\n00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:07.115\nall those approaches were targeted to\ngetting the data, through malware and\n\n312\n00:17:07.115 --> 00:17:11.150\nthrough a variety of manipulations, before\nit actually hit the encryption chain.\n\n313\n00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:15.810\nIn other words, while it was in the system\nin an app in some form before it actually\n\n314\n00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:19.980\nwent into the encryption and\nwas encrypted, they were trying to,\n\n315\n00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:23.410\nin other words, grab that data while\nit was still in plain text form because\n\n316\n00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:27.090\nit is very difficult to\ndecrypt that data effectively\n\n317\n00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:29.480\nin a reasonable amount of time\nif you don't have the key.\n\n318\n00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.620\nWithout that knowledge,\nit becomes very difficult to do.\n\n319\n00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:35.720\nSo they were just using plain,\nold-fashioned common sense.\n\n320\n00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.200\nYou gotta give them credit for that.\n\n321\n00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.120\nHey, where's the easiest\nplace to steal the data?\n\n322\n00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.980\nWell, let's steal it before they encrypt\nit cuz if we get it then, we don't have to\n\n323\n00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:45.770\nworry about coming up with all\nthe whizbang science tools to decrypt it.\n\n324\n00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:48.430\nAll we've gotta do is just make sure\nwe get it before they encrypt it.\n\n325\n00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:50.183\nAnd now that we know that, right,\n\n326\n00:17:50.183 --> 00:17:52.550\nobviously we may take\ndifferent approaches.\n\n327\n00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:55.855\nBut for years, apparently,\nthese tools were being used to steal data\n\n328\n00:17:55.855 --> 00:17:58.725\noff systems prior to encryption,\nand nobody was the wiser.\n\n329\n00:17:58.725 --> 00:18:02.207\nSo we just have to understand that\nwhen we use tools like this, right,\n\n330\n00:18:02.207 --> 00:18:04.036\nwhen we use VPN and things like that,\n\n331\n00:18:04.036 --> 00:18:08.300\nthere is in our mind this thought process\nthat, well, we're safe, we're secure.\n\n332\n00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:11.010\nIt's VPN, so it's gonna be encrypted.\n\n333\n00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:13.850\nWell, what about all the people on the\nback end that manage all that software in\n\n334\n00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:16.950\nthe cloud, as you were saying,\nor third-party VPN vendors?\n\n335\n00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:18.450\nEverything is a service today, right.\n\n336\n00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:21.960\nWhen you buy something as a service,\nyou're buying it anonymously\n\n337\n00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.842\nfrom a company that you really have no\nknowledge of at the end of the day.\n\n338\n00:18:24.842 --> 00:18:28.256\nI mean, most of us, many of us,\nuse cloud services on a regular basis.\n\n339\n00:18:28.256 --> 00:18:31.437\nBut how much do you really know\nabout the cloud service provider?\n\n340\n00:18:31.437 --> 00:18:35.035\nHow much do you know about your data as it\nstreams through their networks and beyond,\n\n341\n00:18:35.035 --> 00:18:36.768\nand is stored there for a period of time?\n\n342\n00:18:36.768 --> 00:18:38.447\nYou really don't know anything\nabout what they're doing at all.\n\n343\n00:18:38.447 --> 00:18:41.338\nI mean, you think you do,\nbut you really don't, right.\n\n344\n00:18:41.338 --> 00:18:43.350\n&gt;&gt; Take a fine-tooth comb and\nread some of those EULAs, and\n\n345\n00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:46.510\nyou might be a little surprised at-\n&gt;&gt; EULAs and SLAs as well,\n\n346\n00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:48.980\nyour hosting agreements,\nall those things, your contracts.\n\n347\n00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:51.040\nI mean, there's a lot of stuff in there.\n\n348\n00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:55.957\nIn many cases, there's often a clause that\nsays they have, being the cloud vendor,\n\n349\n00:18:55.957 --> 00:19:00.602\nthe right, the necessity and the need to\nbe able to comply with any legally served\n\n350\n00:19:00.602 --> 00:19:04.495\nsearch warrant or court papers that\ndictate that they have to give up\n\n351\n00:19:04.495 --> 00:19:07.749\ninformation in the jurisdiction\nwhere that is served.\n\n352\n00:19:07.749 --> 00:19:11.403\nAnd that they're essentially putting you\non notice that your data may be put into\n\n353\n00:19:11.403 --> 00:19:12.638\nthe hands of a government or\n\n354\n00:19:12.638 --> 00:19:16.149\nthird party agency if somebody brings\njustifiable cause or reason to light.\n\n355\n00:19:16.149 --> 00:19:18.364\nMeaning, they show up with\na FISA search warrant or\n\n356\n00:19:18.364 --> 00:19:21.196\nwhatever it may be in the various\ncountries and say, hey, we want\n\n357\n00:19:21.196 --> 00:19:24.879\neverything that Cherokee's been been doing\ncuz we think she's shopping too much.\n\n358\n00:19:24.879 --> 00:19:25.723\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n359\n00:19:25.723 --> 00:19:27.303\ngot to stop her from buying shoes.\n\n360\n00:19:27.303 --> 00:19:30.074\nSo they may show up and\nserve a warrant of some kind,\n\n361\n00:19:30.074 --> 00:19:34.199\nor a cease and desist order will be\nserved, a search warrant will be served,\n\n362\n00:19:34.199 --> 00:19:37.228\netc., on a cloud vendor,\nthey may have to turn over all\n\n363\n00:19:37.228 --> 00:19:40.731\nthe logs of everything Cherokee's IP\nhas been tagged as doing.\n\n364\n00:19:40.731 --> 00:19:44.633\n&gt;&gt; I think they'll be\nsignificantly underwhelmed [LAUGH].\n\n365\n00:19:44.633 --> 00:19:47.912\n&gt;&gt; You've got a spiffy new pair of shoes\non that you weren't wearing yesterday,\n\n366\n00:19:47.912 --> 00:19:48.567\nI don't know.\n\n367\n00:19:48.567 --> 00:19:50.312\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So she's been out shopping, but\n\n368\n00:19:50.312 --> 00:19:53.983\nshe's got at least one new pair of shoes\nI've seen in the last several episodes.\n\n369\n00:19:53.983 --> 00:19:56.165\nBut the outcome would be,\nas you were suggesting,\n\n370\n00:19:56.165 --> 00:19:58.264\nthat potentially that\ndata may be compromised.\n\n371\n00:19:58.264 --> 00:20:01.518\nIt may be given to somebody who may not\nhave, normally, the reason to see it.\n\n372\n00:20:01.518 --> 00:20:03.159\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; And that is very important for\n\n373\n00:20:03.159 --> 00:20:05.070\nus to think about and to be aware of.\n\n374\n00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:06.810\nAll right, so\na good conversation about VPNs.\n\n375\n00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:08.119\nMake sure we're thinking about that.\n\n376\n00:20:08.119 --> 00:20:11.289\nWhat about encryption on the local entity,\nthe local machine?\n\n377\n00:20:11.289 --> 00:20:12.940\nWe have different ways of doing this.\n\n378\n00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:16.590\nMicrosoft's had what's called the EFS,\nthe Encrypting File System out, for many,\n\n379\n00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:17.610\nmany years now.\n\n380\n00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:19.720\nBeen around for many, many moons.\n\n381\n00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.530\nAnd we certainly continue\nto stay in the latest,\n\n382\n00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:26.370\nlatest versions of their operating\nsystems to still see EFS in play.\n\n383\n00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:29.000\nWe also have, starting with Windows 7,\n\n384\n00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.980\nsomething known as BitLocker, which is\na different way of doing encryption.\n\n385\n00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:37.440\nEFS is really focused on encrypting files\nand directories in the file system,\n\n386\n00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.180\nitself, at the file system level.\n\n387\n00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:42.540\nIt's not what we would call\nwhole disk encryption.\n\n388\n00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.900\nAnd BitLocker is whole disk encryption.\n\n389\n00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:48.100\nIt allows us to actually encrypt\nthe entire hard drive and\n\n390\n00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:53.400\napply encryption through a key\nencryption scheme to the hard drive.\n\n391\n00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:58.305\nBitLocker requires the use of what we\ncall a TPM, Trusted Platform Module,\n\n392\n00:20:58.305 --> 00:21:01.330\nan internal chip, hardware chip typically,\n\n393\n00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:05.670\nin the motherboard of the system that\nwill let us act like a cryptovault.\n\n394\n00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:09.580\nWe store our credentials, our keys,\nour certificates, in that chip.\n\n395\n00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:14.240\nAnd we can then onboard in real time,\nencrypt and decrypt or, essentially,\n\n396\n00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:17.090\nunencrypt the drive and\nre-encrypt it on demand.\n\n397\n00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:21.590\nAnd because of that, the onboard keys are\nstored so we can unencrypt the drive or\n\n398\n00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:24.160\nencrypt the drive at startup and\nwork with it.\n\n399\n00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:27.546\nBut if you don't have a TPM,\nyou could still implement BitLocker.\n\n400\n00:21:27.546 --> 00:21:29.444\nYou can use it with an external USB drive.\n\n401\n00:21:29.444 --> 00:21:32.782\nAnd you just have to plug the drive in,\nwhether it's a USB stick or\n\n402\n00:21:32.782 --> 00:21:33.823\nwhatever it may be.\n\n403\n00:21:33.823 --> 00:21:36.812\nBut you have to plug it in when\nyou actually are booting up so\n\n404\n00:21:36.812 --> 00:21:41.021\nwe can load the encryption keys, validate\nthat the drive is encrypted properly,\n\n405\n00:21:41.021 --> 00:21:44.139\nwe have the right key to access it,\nand unencrypt the drive.\n\n406\n00:21:44.139 --> 00:21:49.060\nNow, the nice thing about BitLocker is\nthe encryption attributes are sticky.\n\n407\n00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:52.966\nThey stay with the drive, meaning,\nbecause we you do it at the drive level,\n\n408\n00:21:52.966 --> 00:21:55.041\nif you take the drive out of the machine,\n\n409\n00:21:55.041 --> 00:21:59.430\nload the drive up into another system\nas a data drive, it's still encrypted.\n\n410\n00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:02.141\nIf you did that with EFS\nencryption on a file or a folder,\n\n411\n00:22:02.141 --> 00:22:05.505\nit is limited to the file system,\nunique and specific, to windows.\n\n412\n00:22:05.505 --> 00:22:07.338\n&gt;&gt; You could circumvent that.\n\n413\n00:22:07.338 --> 00:22:11.012\nYou could circumvent it because it\nis limited and specific to NTFS,\n\n414\n00:22:11.012 --> 00:22:15.078\nthe Microsoft file system, or at least\none of the Microsoft file systems.\n\n415\n00:22:15.078 --> 00:22:17.590\nThere are others besides NTFS now.\n\n416\n00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:21.880\nBut for years,\nNTFS was Microsoft's own file system.\n\n417\n00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:25.440\nThere was FAT, which was not Microsoft\nspecific, but it's still implemented and\n\n418\n00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.310\nused as a file system, even to this day.\n\n419\n00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:33.470\nAnd the problem with it, with EFS,\nwas if you transferred EFS encrypted\n\n420\n00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:38.350\ndocuments to a FAT partition, you stripped\nout the EFS protection attributes, and\n\n421\n00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:40.080\nyou could then unencrypt the data.\n\n422\n00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:44.228\nSo there was a problem there because the\nencryption is not supported on non-NTFS\n\n423\n00:22:44.228 --> 00:22:44.962\npartitions.\n\n424\n00:22:44.962 --> 00:22:47.815\nSo we just have to be aware of that and\nunderstand that.\n\n425\n00:22:47.815 --> 00:22:53.045\nSo the key with EFS will be that you're\ndoing file system specific encryption,\n\n426\n00:22:53.045 --> 00:22:54.616\nfile and folder level.\n\n427\n00:22:54.616 --> 00:22:59.521\nBitLocker is operating system specific,\nmeaning it's unique to Windows,\n\n428\n00:22:59.521 --> 00:23:00.885\nspecific to that OS.\n\n429\n00:23:00.885 --> 00:23:03.610\nBut it's considered whole\ndrive encryption, and\n\n430\n00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:06.600\ngives us a much stronger\nlevel of protection.\n\n431\n00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:11.560\nWe do wanna know and understand that we\nuse keys represented by certificates to do\n\n432\n00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:15.090\nencryption and decryption,\nboth with EFS and with BitLocker.\n\n433\n00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:18.874\nYou should be backing up those keys and\nhave a process in place to deal with that.\n\n434\n00:23:18.874 --> 00:23:22.749\nPut some notes in, the show notes for\nyou about how to backup and\n\n435\n00:23:22.749 --> 00:23:25.180\nhow to potentially restore an EFS key.\n\n436\n00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:27.920\nJust in case you've never done it before,\nyou wanna be aware of it.\n\n437\n00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.520\nWe have a program in\nWindows called Cipher.\n\n438\n00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:34.400\nYou can open up a Windows command line,\ntype in Cipher and take a look at it.\n\n439\n00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.350\nAs a matter of fact, if you give me just\nhalf a second while we're doing this,\n\n440\n00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:39.050\nI will show you this real quick.\n\n441\n00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:41.860\nIf you could just bring up my machine for\njust one moment.\n\n442\n00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:42.533\nYou can see right there.\n\n443\n00:23:42.533 --> 00:23:45.026\nAnd if we type in Cipher.\n\n444\n00:23:45.026 --> 00:23:48.805\nAnd as we can do in Windows, if we're\nnot familiar with how a program works,\n\n445\n00:23:48.805 --> 00:23:51.403\nalways encourage you to add\na little forward slash,\n\n446\n00:23:51.403 --> 00:23:55.299\nquestion mark at the end to look at the\nhelp file, which is always important cuz\n\n447\n00:23:55.299 --> 00:23:59.221\nyou want to see how the program works,\nsee what switches are available for it.\n\n448\n00:23:59.221 --> 00:24:00.507\nUnderstand a little bit more about it.\n\n449\n00:24:00.507 --> 00:24:03.876\nSo if you're not familiar with cipher,\njust scroll back up to the top so\n\n450\n00:24:03.876 --> 00:24:04.910\nyou can see this.\n\n451\n00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:07.140\nIt's got a long help file as you can see.\n\n452\n00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:07.890\nAnd they were there for\n\n453\n00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:10.700\nfive days scrolling until they\ngot to the top of the window.\n\n454\n00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:13.610\nAll right, so\nyou can see here that cipher displays or\n\n455\n00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:17.510\nalters encryption of directories or\nfiles on NTFS partitions.\n\n456\n00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:21.610\nSo this is the command line tool\nthat can be used to both back up and\n\n457\n00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:24.070\nthen be used to restore\npotentially our keys, or\n\n458\n00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:26.700\nat least play a part in\nthe restoration activity.\n\n459\n00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:31.370\nWe'll have to open up the security policy\nmanagement console on the local machine in\n\n460\n00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:35.040\norder to be able to do the restore by\nmanipulating the group policy locally.\n\n461\n00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:41.320\nAdding in the exported EFS\nrecovery agent certificate.\n\n462\n00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:44.610\nSo we would be able to back that up,\nback up that key here.\n\n463\n00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:47.640\nTake that and\nyou can see down here with cipher,\n\n464\n00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:53.200\nwe have the ability to do cipher add user,\nciipher cert hash, cert file, etc.\n\n465\n00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:57.390\nWe can export and create that cipher\nforward slash p filename.cert.\n\n466\n00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:01.460\nSo we have all these\ndifferent options we can use.\n\n467\n00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:05.770\nOnce we've gone through and done this,\nand we do cipher forward slash small, or\n\n468\n00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:06.670\nlowercase, r.\n\n469\n00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:10.520\nLet me just scroll down and\nshow you this here.\n\n470\n00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:13.145\nLet me get to,\ngive me just half a second here.\n\n471\n00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:18.310\nJust do that real quick and, wait hold on.\n\n472\n00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:19.840\nI don't want that.\n\n473\n00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:20.420\nI wanted that.\n\n474\n00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:21.340\nI just hit the wrong one.\n\n475\n00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:22.590\nThere we go.\nWhen it's all white,\n\n476\n00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:26.030\nyou can't actually see\nthe top of the screen.\n\n477\n00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:28.245\nWhat I just wanted to\nshow you here was this.\n\n478\n00:25:28.245 --> 00:25:32.185\nYou'll see forward slash r, right there.\n\n479\n00:25:32.185 --> 00:25:34.595\nGenerates EFS recovery key and\ncertificate.\n\n480\n00:25:34.595 --> 00:25:38.995\nThat's the command, the slash,\nthe switch is what I'm thinking of.\n\n481\n00:25:38.995 --> 00:25:42.205\nThat's a switch that we're gonna\nuse with cipher in order to\n\n482\n00:25:42.205 --> 00:25:43.905\ngenerate that recovery key and export it.\n\n483\n00:25:43.905 --> 00:25:48.675\nSo cipher forward slash r and then you'll\ncolon file name is what we would type in,\n\n484\n00:25:48.675 --> 00:25:51.915\npath, c colon whatever and\nwe would have that.\n\n485\n00:25:51.915 --> 00:25:55.645\nAnd then once we use that or have that,\nI'll show you the other part in a minute,\n\n486\n00:25:55.645 --> 00:25:59.530\nwe'll open up the security policy MMC,\nand I'll show you that.\n\n487\n00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:03.770\nWe would then import that certificate to\nallow us to then act as a recovery agent.\n\n488\n00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:05.640\nBut notice by default there,\n\n489\n00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:10.860\nforward slash r creates a 2048-bit RSA\nrecovery key and certificate, right?\n\n490\n00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:14.690\nSo, we get a 2048-bit\nRSA key automatically\n\n491\n00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:16.840\nunless we choose something different.\n\n492\n00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:20.090\nWe could choose ECC,\nECC as in your favorite.\n\n493\n00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:21.240\nWhat's ECC, remember?\n\n494\n00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.920\n&gt;&gt; Elliptical curve cryptography.\n\n495\n00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:23.980\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely correct.\n\n496\n00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:27.670\nAnd then we can modify the key size,\nas you can see, and we get a lower or\n\n497\n00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:30.600\nsmaller key size, but\nwe have a variable key size there.\n\n498\n00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:33.510\nSo there's some subtlety you\nhave to be aware of with this to\n\n499\n00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:35.090\nbetter understand how it works.\n\n500\n00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:38.750\nSo we've done that part, let's take\na look at one more thing here real quick.\n\n501\n00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:39.950\nJust do WIN+R.\n\n502\n00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:43.350\nWe'll open up an MMC,\nactually we'll do secpol.\n\n503\n00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:47.650\nSo secpol.mmc and whoops,\ndid I type that correctly?\n\n504\n00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.090\nMsc, I typed mmc.\n\n505\n00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:54.190\nMsc is what I meant.\n\n506\n00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:57.280\n&gt;&gt; I think you typed it again.\n\n507\n00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.570\n&gt;&gt; No, I just don't have,\nno, you know why?\n\n508\n00:26:58.570 --> 00:26:59.210\nThis is a native.\n\n509\n00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:00.020\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I can't see that far.\n\n510\n00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:03.760\n&gt;&gt; No, I did type it cuz when\nNate set up the VM for me,\n\n511\n00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:06.470\nhe made himself the administrator and\ndidn't give me admin rights.\n\n512\n00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:09.800\nSo I can't launch the MSC natively.\n\n513\n00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:13.940\nBut what you would do if you just go ahead\nand type in and then give me a second.\n\n514\n00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:16.850\nI will scroll down so you can see it\nin the notes here just so you know.\n\n515\n00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:23.230\nIf you, right there, if you go ahead and\n\n516\n00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:27.120\nyou type in the notes I gave you the step\nby step and I highlight it there.\n\n517\n00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.830\nIf you type in on a Windows machine with\nadmin rights cuz they don't trust me to\n\n518\n00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:34.200\nhave admin rights on the machine so\nI don't have them but if you type in,\n\n519\n00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.230\nI normally get prompted.\n\n520\n00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:37.970\nAnd I will do it with an admin,\n\n521\n00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:40.160\nI'll do it from a command line\nthat has admin rights in a second.\n\n522\n00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.980\nYeah, but I just forgot,\nhe didn't give me the rights.\n\n523\n00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:44.100\nSo that's why it gave me\nerror when I typed it.\n\n524\n00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:48.310\nBut if you type in secpol.msc, you will\nthen get the rights or seat to do this.\n\n525\n00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:53.050\nSo, give me a second, let me actually\nlaunch a command line that has rights.\n\n526\n00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:55.290\nAnd then we can go in and do this.\n\n527\n00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:58.680\nSo give me one second, there we go.\n\n528\n00:27:58.680 --> 00:27:59.571\nNow wait, hold on.\n\n529\n00:28:01.691 --> 00:28:02.700\nYa know what we're gonna do?\n\n530\n00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.333\nWe're gonna do the following.\n\n531\n00:28:08.304 --> 00:28:12.587\nWe're gonna let you in on a little secret\nbehind the scenes and show you how\n\n532\n00:28:12.587 --> 00:28:17.290\nwe actually create all the lab magic\nhere at ITProTV when we are presenting.\n\n533\n00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:19.740\nWe're gonna bring up\nour Windows 7 machine,\n\n534\n00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:22.810\ncuz I'm just not gonna mess around with\nit and we're just gonna do it over here.\n\n535\n00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:25.480\nAnd we're just gonna thumb our nose at\nNate and not tell him that we did it.\n\n536\n00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.570\nSo shh,\ndon't say anything to him when I do this.\n\n537\n00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:30.620\nAll right, so we're gonna go in here and\nwe're just gonna launch a command line\n\n538\n00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:33.680\nfrom here, because in this environment\nactually I have full admin rights so\n\n539\n00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.630\nwe'll just do it right\nfrom here in Windows 7.\n\n540\n00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:38.920\nSo let me just open up\naccessories here really quickly.\n\n541\n00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.990\nLet's get a command prompt there,\n\n542\n00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:44.860\nlet's run that as an admin and\nthat'll just make it so much easier.\n\n543\n00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:48.110\nThere we go, whoops, there we, come on.\n\n544\n00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:54.601\nThere we go, all right so from there,\nright, we can type in secpol.msc.\n\n545\n00:28:54.601 --> 00:28:59.731\nAnd when we do that,\nwe'll get our security policy,\n\n546\n00:28:59.731 --> 00:29:02.471\nlocal security policy MMC.\n\n547\n00:29:02.471 --> 00:29:07.004\nWe can bring that up and then what we\nwould do is we would come in here, and\n\n548\n00:29:07.004 --> 00:29:09.662\nwe would go in to our public key policies.\n\n549\n00:29:09.662 --> 00:29:11.413\nWe would go in to our EFS area,\n\n550\n00:29:11.413 --> 00:29:15.360\nyou'll notice no encrypting\nfile system policy is defined.\n\n551\n00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.960\nWe would right-click Add\ndata recovery agent.\n\n552\n00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.210\nWe'd run this little wizard here.\n\n553\n00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:23.840\nClick there, and one of the first\nthings we have to do is go in and\n\n554\n00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:28.730\nselect our recovery agents and\nbring in our CER file, our .cer,\n\n555\n00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:31.130\none of our certificate\nextensions that we talked about.\n\n556\n00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:35.990\nAnd we would be importing that certificate\nthat we created from the command line\n\n557\n00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:40.706\nin the other part of the demo where I ran\ncipher forward slash r colon file path.\n\n558\n00:29:40.706 --> 00:29:44.210\nI would take that certificate,\nbring it in here and\n\n559\n00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:47.435\nthen I would load that and that would\nallow me to act as the recovery agent and\n\n560\n00:29:47.435 --> 00:29:50.945\nunencrypt the data that\nhad been encrypted.\n\n561\n00:29:50.945 --> 00:29:54.665\nThat either we lost the key to unencrypt\nor that another user has encrypted,\n\n562\n00:29:54.665 --> 00:29:58.695\nand then I have to master or\nhave the master recovery for, and then,\n\n563\n00:29:58.695 --> 00:29:59.490\nI would be able to read it.\n\n564\n00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:00.535\nI'd be able to unencrypt it.\n\n565\n00:30:00.535 --> 00:30:03.915\nSo this is what you would actually do if\nyou follow the steps in the show notes\n\n566\n00:30:03.915 --> 00:30:04.745\nto be able to run through.\n\n567\n00:30:04.745 --> 00:30:06.375\nYou just have to have that\nlittle certificate file.\n\n568\n00:30:06.375 --> 00:30:08.475\nYou bring it in and\nyou'd be able to do that with no trouble.\n\n569\n00:30:08.475 --> 00:30:12.330\nSo as they say, bing bang boom,\nand there you are right there.\n\n570\n00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:15.641\nDespite his best efforts to the contrary\nto prevent me from demoing it.\n\n571\n00:30:15.641 --> 00:30:17.390\nNate, right?\n\n572\n00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:18.150\nBut we got in there.\n\n573\n00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:21.020\nI just forgot that he had not given\nme permission on that machine.\n\n574\n00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:24.630\nAt least you can see what that looks like,\nand you can see of course how\n\n575\n00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:28.602\nwe are presenting that thought process and\nwhat we're doing with it.\n\n576\n00:30:28.602 --> 00:30:31.150\nOkay, so just wanted you to be\nable to take a look at that.\n\n577\n00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:34.340\nLet me just bring my notes back\nup while we're here talking so\n\n578\n00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:36.220\nyou could see the steps we put in there.\n\n579\n00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:38.720\nWe talked a bit about Bitlocker as well.\n\n580\n00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:42.360\nAnd I wanted to just go through a list\nwith you about some common mistakes\n\n581\n00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:44.800\nthat lead to weak\ncryptographic implementations.\n\n582\n00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:48.280\nWe've talked a lot about\nhow these things happens.\n\n583\n00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:51.070\nAnd we've been saying in various\nepisodes all the way through\n\n584\n00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:52.070\nall of our conversations, hey,\n\n585\n00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:55.720\ndon't do this, do this this way,\nmake sure you to remember to do this.\n\n586\n00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.550\nAnd we've been talking\nthrough these things.\n\n587\n00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:59.719\nBut I wanna bring them together\nkind of in a list for you.\n\n588\n00:30:59.719 --> 00:31:02.932\nPut them all out there so\nthat we understand how that we should\n\n589\n00:31:02.932 --> 00:31:07.411\nbe thinking about or looking at overcoming\nthese things that can be of concern to us.\n\n590\n00:31:07.411 --> 00:31:09.020\nSo we got a few things here.\n\n591\n00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:11.498\nUse a standard modulus in our safe.\n\n592\n00:31:11.498 --> 00:31:17.750\nRemember the modulus is gonna be\nthe remainder, the output, right?\n\n593\n00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:20.250\nThe small modulus makes\ncryptanalysis easier.\n\n594\n00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:25.040\nThe larger the modulus, the harder\nit is to guess what we're doing.\n\n595\n00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:30.430\nAnd so, we wanna use larger keys,\nlarger prime numbers, larger factoring.\n\n596\n00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:34.780\nSo we use these ridiculously large\nnumbers to be able to generate keys\n\n597\n00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:37.280\nbecause it makes it harder for\nus to do the cryptanalysis.\n\n598\n00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:41.090\nAnd remember we are gonna be talking\nabout cryptanalysis in upcoming episodes\n\n599\n00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:44.020\nabout how cryptanalysis works,\nthe study, the art,\n\n600\n00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:46.510\nthe science of breaking\ncryptographic systems.\n\n601\n00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:49.649\nSo how do we attack them, how do we\nlook for weaknesses, things like that.\n\n602\n00:31:49.649 --> 00:31:52.649\nSo we don't wanna use small,\nas we've been talking about key spaces,\n\n603\n00:31:52.649 --> 00:31:55.804\nsmall work factors We want large ones,\nso we've been talking about that.\n\n604\n00:31:55.804 --> 00:31:59.060\nUsing seeds for symmetric algorithms\nthat are not random enough.\n\n605\n00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:02.100\nThese will be initialization vectors or\ninitial seeds.\n\n606\n00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:04.140\nGotta use large IVs.\n\n607\n00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:05.940\nLarger the seed, larger the key space,\n\n608\n00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:08.230\nlarger the work factor,\nharder it is to decrypt.\n\n609\n00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:09.790\nSo we've been talking about that.\n\n610\n00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:12.558\nHard coded cryptographic secrets or\nelements.\n\n611\n00:32:12.558 --> 00:32:16.819\nNothing worse than looking at software,\nexamining code and\n\n612\n00:32:16.819 --> 00:32:22.417\nfinding that the developers have hard\ncoded credentials put in information and\n\n613\n00:32:22.417 --> 00:32:26.111\nreferenced it in the code and\nthat we know what it is.\n\n614\n00:32:26.111 --> 00:32:27.231\nThat's never acceptable.\n\n615\n00:32:27.231 --> 00:32:30.470\nYou should be using variables for\nthat and obfuscating those variables.\n\n616\n00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:34.753\nSo that you're passing through this\ninformation in a way that is not gonna\n\n617\n00:32:34.753 --> 00:32:35.728\ncompromise it.\n\n618\n00:32:35.728 --> 00:32:39.430\nIf we hard code them and we put them into\nthe system and we enter them there so\n\n619\n00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:43.612\nthat everybody knows what they are, then\nall somebody has to do is get the program,\n\n620\n00:32:43.612 --> 00:32:45.853\nbreak it open,\ndecompile it and look at it.\n\n621\n00:32:45.853 --> 00:32:47.640\nAnd they'll find the information.\n\n622\n00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:51.490\nSo we never wanna see hard coded\ncredentials or cryptographic secrets.\n\n623\n00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:53.159\nCryptographic secrets\nare simply credentials.\n\n624\n00:32:53.159 --> 00:32:54.295\nUsernames and passwords.\n\n625\n00:32:54.295 --> 00:32:57.923\nThat's just fancy cryptographic talk for\na password or an element,\n\n626\n00:32:57.923 --> 00:32:59.872\nsome sort of a key or anything alike.\n\n627\n00:32:59.872 --> 00:33:01.130\nWe don't wanna see that.\n\n628\n00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:03.530\nWe wanna see variables that obfuscate.\n\n629\n00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:05.550\nWe don't wanna use keys\nthat are too short.\n\n630\n00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:06.570\nWe don't wanna reuse keys.\n\n631\n00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:08.080\nWe talked about these issues.\n\n632\n00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:11.990\nUsing insecure or unsecure key escrow,\nnever a good idea.\n\n633\n00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:15.530\nYou talked about extending trust\nto known third parties and\n\n634\n00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:17.610\nthe concerns about that if\nwe don't know who they are.\n\n635\n00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:20.180\nSo stranger danger is what\nwe would say there, right?\n\n636\n00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:23.624\nDon't give strangers the ability to store\nyour key because you don't know who\n\n637\n00:33:23.624 --> 00:33:25.412\nthey are and they may use it against you.\n\n638\n00:33:25.412 --> 00:33:28.234\nUse of an insecure\ncryptographic block mode.\n\n639\n00:33:28.234 --> 00:33:31.716\nWe talked about different ways in\nwhich block ciphers are implemented.\n\n640\n00:33:31.716 --> 00:33:33.951\nRemember ECB, electronic code book.\n\n641\n00:33:33.951 --> 00:33:35.949\nCBC, cypher block chaining.\n\n642\n00:33:35.949 --> 00:33:39.275\nPCBC, propagating cipher block chaining.\n\n643\n00:33:39.275 --> 00:33:44.450\nCounter and OFB, which are blocks\nthat are made to work like streams.\n\n644\n00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:46.694\nWe talked about a whole bunch of\nthese in one of the prior episodes.\n\n645\n00:33:46.694 --> 00:33:49.512\nEncourage you to go back and\ntake a look if you don't remember that.\n\n646\n00:33:49.512 --> 00:33:54.481\nBut I called out the fact that ECB is\nfairly insecure because it does simply\n\n647\n00:33:54.481 --> 00:33:56.895\none round and we're done, right?\n\n648\n00:33:56.895 --> 00:34:00.905\nPlain text running through the key in the\ncryptosystem, cipher text out the bottom.\n\n649\n00:34:00.905 --> 00:34:05.758\nNo connection, no rounding, no chaining\nof any kind 2x or multiple times,\n\n650\n00:34:05.758 --> 00:34:07.783\nno xoring, nothing like that.\n\n651\n00:34:07.783 --> 00:34:09.191\nSo it's very simplistic.\n\n652\n00:34:09.191 --> 00:34:10.910\nIt really doesn't afford\na lot of protection.\n\n653\n00:34:10.910 --> 00:34:14.690\nSo I told you we don't really implement\nthat although it is something that we see.\n\n654\n00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:16.700\nAnd that is considered insecure.\n\n655\n00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:19.078\nUser proprietor cryptographic algorithms.\n\n656\n00:34:19.078 --> 00:34:22.676\nThis idea of blackbox algorithms\nthat nobody really understands but\n\n657\n00:34:22.676 --> 00:34:27.463\nwe're being told by a vendor, hey, trust\nme, right, implement this, is problematic.\n\n658\n00:34:27.463 --> 00:34:30.371\nCuz we don't really know if\nthere are weaknesses there.\n\n659\n00:34:30.371 --> 00:34:35.115\nIf you remember the story about Skipjack\nand the Clipper chip that we talked about,\n\n660\n00:34:35.115 --> 00:34:39.587\nthis was the NSA's attempt in the United\nStates to be able to essentially foist\n\n661\n00:34:39.587 --> 00:34:41.911\na proprietary algorithm on the public.\n\n662\n00:34:41.911 --> 00:34:45.090\nThinking that nobody would realize\nthat they had backdoor keys.\n\n663\n00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:47.880\nWell, we know that really didn't\nwork out very well, right?\n\n664\n00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:51.538\nBut that would be the challenge with this,\nis that if the vendor has implemented\n\n665\n00:34:51.538 --> 00:34:55.307\nan algorithm and we don't know enough\nabout it, we don't really understand it,\n\n666\n00:34:55.307 --> 00:34:56.907\nhow do we know if it's good or bad?\n\n667\n00:34:56.907 --> 00:34:57.988\nI mean, it may be secure but\n\n668\n00:34:57.988 --> 00:35:00.626\nit also may give them the ability\nto read everything we're doing.\n\n669\n00:35:00.626 --> 00:35:03.149\nSo this is a significant challenge for\nus as well.\n\n670\n00:35:03.149 --> 00:35:05.644\nSo we do wanna be aware of that and\njust think about that.\n\n671\n00:35:05.644 --> 00:35:10.766\nBecause this hitlist of common concerns,\nand mistakes can lead to,\n\n672\n00:35:10.766 --> 00:35:15.465\nnot only exposure of data, so\nviolation of confidentiality.\n\n673\n00:35:15.465 --> 00:35:18.884\nBut also can lead to breaches of\nintegrity, data could be modified without\n\n674\n00:35:18.884 --> 00:35:21.820\nour knowledge or consent, and\nbreaches of availability.\n\n675\n00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:24.093\nThe three pillars of information\nsecurity management.\n\n676\n00:35:24.093 --> 00:35:27.684\nData could be removed from systems in\ncritical times when it's supposed to\n\n677\n00:35:27.684 --> 00:35:28.204\nbe there.\n\n678\n00:35:28.204 --> 00:35:31.542\nAnd we may not be able to engage\nin activities when we need to.\n\n679\n00:35:31.542 --> 00:35:34.060\nAnd authorized people may not be able\nto see data when they're supposed to.\n\n680\n00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:38.369\nSo this list can really help\nus as security professionals,\n\n681\n00:35:38.369 --> 00:35:42.948\nas certified encryption specialist\nto focus on the criteria.\n\n682\n00:35:42.948 --> 00:35:46.998\nWe have to make sure we implement the\ncontrol mechanisms we have to make sure\n\n683\n00:35:46.998 --> 00:35:49.266\nare there to prevent the kind of attacks.\n\n684\n00:35:49.266 --> 00:35:52.542\nAnd to forestall the behavior\nthat may lead to compromise, so\n\n685\n00:35:52.542 --> 00:35:55.000\nthis is gonna be very important,\nforestall.\n\n686\n00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.130\nThat's a big SAT vocabulary\nword right there.\n\n687\n00:35:57.130 --> 00:36:00.820\nThat's like a double score in Scrabble,\nright?\n\n688\n00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:01.803\nI'm cool, you should like me.\n\n689\n00:36:01.803 --> 00:36:03.384\n&gt;&gt; Dictionary.com, there you go.\n\n690\n00:36:03.384 --> 00:36:05.631\nThesarus.com too,\nuse that one all the time.\n\n691\n00:36:05.631 --> 00:36:06.918\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a good one, yeah.\n\n692\n00:36:06.918 --> 00:36:08.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, thank you for those tips.\n\n693\n00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:09.091\nI appreciate that.\n\n694\n00:36:09.091 --> 00:36:09.827\n&gt;&gt; You are welcome.\n\n695\n00:36:09.827 --> 00:36:11.167\nAre you telling me we're out of time?\n\n696\n00:36:11.167 --> 00:36:12.700\n&gt;&gt; We have reached that time.\n\n697\n00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:14.609\n&gt;&gt; I do not accept your proclamation.\n\n698\n00:36:14.609 --> 00:36:16.214\nI insist we have more time.\n\n699\n00:36:16.214 --> 00:36:18.081\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Wait, wait, here.\n\n700\n00:36:18.081 --> 00:36:20.485\nI'd like to buy some more\ntime with my private key.\n\n701\n00:36:20.485 --> 00:36:22.416\n&gt;&gt; You know what,\nI wish I knew that secret.\n\n702\n00:36:22.416 --> 00:36:24.989\nMaybe you can share it with\nus in the next episode.\n\n703\n00:36:24.989 --> 00:36:25.928\n&gt;&gt; You are just no fun.\n\n704\n00:36:25.928 --> 00:36:26.989\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna\n\n705\n00:36:26.989 --> 00:36:28.417\ncall you Debbie Downer now cuz\nyou are being a Debbie Downer.\n\n706\n00:36:28.417 --> 00:36:29.773\n&gt;&gt; I know, I am a Debbie Downer, sorry.\n\n707\n00:36:29.773 --> 00:36:31.892\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we do have to take off,\nbut we're coming back, correct?\n\n708\n00:36:31.892 --> 00:36:32.473\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great.\n\n709\n00:36:32.473 --> 00:36:33.187\n&gt;&gt; We have another episode?\n\n710\n00:36:33.187 --> 00:36:33.761\n&gt;&gt; That's the deal.\n\n711\n00:36:33.761 --> 00:36:34.289\n&gt;&gt; You promise?\n\n712\n00:36:34.289 --> 00:36:35.196\n&gt;&gt; I promise.\n\n713\n00:36:35.196 --> 00:36:36.176\n&gt;&gt; Shake on it, pinky promise?\n\n714\n00:36:36.176 --> 00:36:37.387\nThat's what my little one makes me do.\n\n715\n00:36:37.387 --> 00:36:38.787\nDoes that yours do that?\n\n716\n00:36:38.787 --> 00:36:40.554\nMy little one, all the time she makes-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] [INAUDIBLE] that yet.\n\n717\n00:36:40.554 --> 00:36:42.196\n&gt;&gt; No, she makes me do pinky promises.\n\n718\n00:36:42.196 --> 00:36:44.454\nWhen she wants me to do something,\nshe's like, do you pinky promise?\n\n719\n00:36:44.454 --> 00:36:47.538\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is my almost, now,\n\n720\n00:36:47.538 --> 00:36:48.880\n14 year old daughter.\n\n721\n00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:49.788\n&gt;&gt; What about to everyone else?\n\n722\n00:36:49.788 --> 00:36:51.002\nLet's pinky promise, there we go.\n\n723\n00:36:51.002 --> 00:36:51.705\n&gt;&gt; We're coming back for another episode.\n\n724\n00:36:51.705 --> 00:36:53.805\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat's our virtual pinky promise, okay.\n\n725\n00:36:53.805 --> 00:36:55.357\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nwe're gonna come back, cool.\n\n726\n00:36:55.357 --> 00:36:57.570\n&gt;&gt; All right, we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this show.\n\n727\n00:36:57.570 --> 00:37:00.704\nRemember, I'm your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n728\n00:37:00.704 --> 00:37:01.912\nWho are you?\n\n729\n00:37:01.912 --> 00:37:03.116\n&gt;&gt; I'm nothing, I pinky promised,\nI don't have to say anything.\n\n730\n00:37:03.116 --> 00:37:04.955\n&gt;&gt; You're boycotting this, okay.\n\n731\n00:37:04.955 --> 00:37:06.035\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I promised I'm coming back.\n\n732\n00:37:06.035 --> 00:37:07.273\nI don't have to tell them who I am.\n\n733\n00:37:07.273 --> 00:37:08.469\nIf they tune back in, they'll know who I\nam when you introduce me the next time.\n\n734\n00:37:08.469 --> 00:37:09.687\n&gt;&gt; They'll know, that's

00:00:08.263\n[CROSSTALK]\n[SOUND]\n\n4\n00:00:08.263 --> 00:00:11.557\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.557 --> 00:00:13.544\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your ECES series.\n\n6\n00:00:13.544 --> 00:00:15.524\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:15.524 --> 00:00:19.708\nAnd just as pinkie promised we're back\nin the studios to give you some more\n\n8\n00:00:19.708 --> 00:00:22.080\napplications of cryptography.\n\n9\n00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.730\nJoining me today, we have Mr.\nAdam Gordan in studios.\n\n10\n00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:25.890\nThank you, Adam.\n\n11\n00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.120\n&gt;&gt; I got you a present.\n\n12\n00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.652\n&gt;&gt; You did?\n\n13\n00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:29.020\n&gt;&gt; I did.\nI got you a present.\n\n14\n00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.090\nYou wanna close your eyes and\nI'll give you the present?\n\n15\n00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.880\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, hold out your hand.\n\n16\n00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.000\nSo I got you this.\n\n17\n00:00:37.122 --> 00:00:37.866\n&gt;&gt; A banana.\n\n18\n00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:39.120\n&gt;&gt; A banana.\n\n19\n00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.900\n&gt;&gt; Hello.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it is the perfect color that\n\n20\n00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.210\ngoes with our key.\n\n21\n00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.950\n&gt;&gt; That's kind of random.\n\n22\n00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:45.730\n&gt;&gt; It is, isn't it?\n\n23\n00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.120\nIt's like almost the same color.\n\n24\n00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is.\n&gt;&gt; It's even got\n\n25\n00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.260\nthe same brown marks on it cuz I aged it\nfor like just the right amount of time.\n\n26\n00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.790\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n\n27\n00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:52.490\n&gt;&gt; Isn't that cool?\n\n28\n00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.520\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; So it can be our banana key now.\n\n29\n00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.308\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n30\n00:00:55.308 --> 00:00:59.090\nthat's your present cuz you've been doing\nsuch a great job with all of the analogies\n\n31\n00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.020\nand discussions that we've been having.\n\n32\n00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.950\n&gt;&gt; They let me eat, if I get x\namount of shows in, I can have food.\n\n33\n00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:03.570\n&gt;&gt; That's right!\nWe do!\n\n34\n00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.870\nShe gets a banana, so\nthat is why we gave her one.\n\n35\n00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.310\nBut what we wanna continue\ntalking about here, and\n\n36\n00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.590\nwe've been doing such a great job, and\nagain, I do really all kidding aside,\n\n37\n00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.010\nall seriousness, wanna thank Cherokee.\n\n38\n00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.750\nShe brings a lot of really interesting\ninsights, observations, and\n\n39\n00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.190\nalso the fun stories to our discussions,\nand\n\n40\n00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.800\nhas taught me some new things about\nhow to view the conversations we have.\n\n41\n00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.494\nI, to this day,\n\n42\n00:01:25.494 --> 00:01:28.889\nstill think about the egg analogy that she\nshared with us in some prior episodes.\n\n43\n00:01:30.745 --> 00:01:33.530\nAnd really just giving us a different\ninsight, a different look,\n\n44\n00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.290\na different way of\nexamining this information.\n\n45\n00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.240\nAnd it's so important to have more than\none perspective as we talk about this.\n\n46\n00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.005\n&gt;&gt; Always.\n&gt;&gt; And so, it's really critical,\n\n47\n00:01:41.005 --> 00:01:42.025\nreally important for\n\n48\n00:01:42.025 --> 00:01:45.780\nall of you to be able to be thinking\nabout what we're talking about here.\n\n49\n00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.760\nInternalize that knowledge,\nmake it your own.\n\n50\n00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.755\nHave an understanding of the theory.\n\n51\n00:01:49.755 --> 00:01:50.542\nObviously, clearly,\n\n52\n00:01:50.542 --> 00:01:54.030\nthere's some bedrock baseline\nfoundational knowledge you gotta know.\n\n53\n00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.370\nBut don't be afraid to then take that and\nexplain it in a way that makes sense to\n\n54\n00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.960\nyou, as long as you capture the essence\nof what we're talking about.\n\n55\n00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.130\nAnd that's what Cherokee does really well.\n\n56\n00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.787\nAnd so, glad to have her joining me for\nthis conversation as she has been for\n\n57\n00:02:05.787 --> 00:02:08.700\nall of our episodes in\nthe entire show with just one or\n\n58\n00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.290\ntwo where we let Daniel\nsneak in the studio.\n\n59\n00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.180\nBut, yeah, you know wasn't as\ngood as when Cherokee was here.\n\n60\n00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.350\nSo let's continue talking.\n\n61\n00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.740\nSo what are we gonna talk about now?\n\n62\n00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.140\nWe're gonna talk about steganography and\nsteganalysis, if I'm not mistaken.\n\n63\n00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.150\nAnd steganosaurus,\nin case you like those as well.\n\n64\n00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.810\nWe can throw those in.\n\n65\n00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.480\nI don't have my cool little steganosaurus.\n\n66\n00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.500\nI have a little wax one, a little dinosaur\none that I used to keep in my car,\n\n67\n00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.370\nbut then it got really hot-\n&gt;&gt; It melted?\n\n68\n00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.895\n&gt;&gt; And he melted.\n\n69\n00:02:30.895 --> 00:02:32.505\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And now we just call him Puddles.\n\n70\n00:02:32.505 --> 00:02:34.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah, that's his name now.\n\n71\n00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.340\nBut steganography and steganalysis.\n\n72\n00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.470\nSo, lets think about steganogrophy.\n\n73\n00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.050\nWe were chatting just before we\ncame on about steganogrophy.\n\n74\n00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.860\nDidn't get very far, because we started\na conversation, and then well you know.\n\n75\n00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.825\n&gt;&gt; I could probably explain it,\nbut I'd have to be a little vague.\n\n76\n00:02:48.825 --> 00:02:50.210\n[INAUDIBLE] fill in the blank.\n\n77\n00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.660\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, lets not be vague,\nlets not explain that.\n\n78\n00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.970\nLets just keep it high level,\nand lets not overly confuse and\n\n79\n00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.830\nobfuscate the people that we're\ntalking to about steganography.\n\n80\n00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.440\nBut let's just talk at a high\nlevel about the thought process.\n\n81\n00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.390\nSo the idea behind steganography is\nthe idea of hiding in plain sight, right?\n\n82\n00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.625\nEssentially, we're thinking about\nthe ability to hide a secret message or\n\n83\n00:03:09.625 --> 00:03:14.265\nsome sort of data, whatever it may be,\ninside of a common carrier.\n\n84\n00:03:14.265 --> 00:03:15.605\nAnd can you bring back up the banana,\n\n85\n00:03:15.605 --> 00:03:17.595\nthere was actually reason\nthat I gave you the banana.\n\n86\n00:03:17.595 --> 00:03:20.775\nIt wasn't just because I wanted to give\nyou, I did wanna give you a present, but\n\n87\n00:03:20.775 --> 00:03:23.865\nI also wanna to use it as analogy for\nsteganography, right?\n\n88\n00:03:23.865 --> 00:03:24.665\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n89\n00:03:24.665 --> 00:03:27.320\nif we think about the banana,\nthis thing right here.\n\n90\n00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.020\nNotice that the banana is whole, intact.\n\n91\n00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.370\nIt is a banana, it is not an orange\nmasquerading as a banana.\n\n92\n00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.030\nSo it is a banana.\n\n93\n00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.010\nBut the bananas are interesting for\nseveral reasons.\n\n94\n00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.570\nFull of potassium and\nall good sorts of stuff.\n\n95\n00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But in addition,\n\n96\n00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.930\nyou have an outer wrapper and\nthen inside you have of course the banana.\n\n97\n00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.450\nSo it's like steganography,\n\n98\n00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.600\nbecause inside of the banana\nskin we have hidden the banana.\n\n99\n00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.350\nBut if you have never\nseen a banana before,\n\n100\n00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.810\nif you're not familiar with one, you would\nthink the banana is simply the yellow,\n\n101\n00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.310\ngreenish kind of skin or fruit or\nwhatever you think it is this way, right?\n\n102\n00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.660\nBut if you open up the banana, then you\nactually see there's something inside,\n\n103\n00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.760\nsomething different, something\nhidden inside of the original thing.\n\n104\n00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.950\nWe call this the container or\nthe carrier, right?\n\n105\n00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.280\nAnd then inside,\nwe refer to this as the payload.\n\n106\n00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.840\nSo if the banana itself is the payload,\nthen the skin,\n\n107\n00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.110\nthe outer wrapper,\nis what we hide it inside of.\n\n108\n00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.710\nThis is the thought process\nbehind steganography.\n\n109\n00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.390\nBet you never woke up this morning\nthinking you'd be explaining staganometry\n\n110\n00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:21.360\nwith a guy with a banana?\n\n111\n00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.940\n&gt;&gt; Never in my dreams.\n\n112\n00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.760\n&gt;&gt; That's the value of ITProTV\nright there, boys and girls.\n\n113\n00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.250\nThat is yours, thank you very much.\n\n114\n00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.580\n&gt;&gt; I'm actually allergic to bananas.\n\n115\n00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.320\n&gt;&gt; In that case let's keep this over here,\nand shame on me for\n\n116\n00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.110\ngiving it to you without checking first.\n\n117\n00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.430\nShould I get a full allergy history?\n\n118\n00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.410\n&gt;&gt; It's not even allergy,\nit's an intolerance, whatever that means.\n\n119\n00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.260\n&gt;&gt; So what you're just trying to say\npolitely is that you just really\n\n120\n00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.060\ndon't like bananas?\n\n121\n00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.780\n&gt;&gt; Kind of.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so it's okay.\n\n122\n00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.540\nBanana is not gonna get\nit's feelings hurt, right?\n\n123\n00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.388\nJust say that, it's okay,\nit will just go away on it's own,\n\n124\n00:04:46.388 --> 00:04:47.430\nyou won't have to worry about it.\n\n125\n00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.472\nAll right, so the idea behind\nstaganography is this idea of actually of\n\n126\n00:04:50.472 --> 00:04:52.480\nhiding something inside of something else.\n\n127\n00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.240\nNow, we can do this in a lot\nof different ways, of course.\n\n128\n00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.960\nBananas are just one way of\nexplaining that visually.\n\n129\n00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.960\nCertainly not what we actually do.\n\n130\n00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.210\nWe don't have a banana steganography tool.\n\n131\n00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.930\nBut we do have all sorts of tools that\nallow us to hide things in audio files,\n\n132\n00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.190\nvideo files, pictures,\ndata, other documents.\n\n133\n00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.090\nThere's all different ways we\ncan engage in steganography.\n\n134\n00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.650\nWe often will commonly use what is\nreferred to as the LSB approach, or\n\n135\n00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.660\nleast significant bit replacement concept,\nwhere we take a lot of the white space,\n\n136\n00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.820\nthis area inside of a typical file that\nreally doesn't hold anything significant\n\n137\n00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:35.045\nbut is just there as padding, extra space,\nmetadata, who knows what it might be,\n\n138\n00:05:35.045 --> 00:05:38.400\nbut stuff that's not central and\ncore to what we're doing.\n\n139\n00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.600\nAnd we'll replace those bits with the\nactual bits that we're looking to hide or\n\n140\n00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.100\nsprinkle inside.\n\n141\n00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:49.010\nAnd if we do that in a way that\ndoes not overly expose those bits,\n\n142\n00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:53.570\nbut rather seamlessly interweaves\nthem into the existing data,\n\n143\n00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:58.660\nthen the application of that\nsteganography, stegoing a file or\n\n144\n00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.420\nstegoing the data as we say, hides\nthe actual message that we're looking to\n\n145\n00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:08.550\nsecret inside the normal data and\ndoesn't make it appear as if it's there.\n\n146\n00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:09.950\nThere are many examples of this.\n\n147\n00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.790\nBut if you think about from the art world,\ncouple of very famous artists that you may\n\n148\n00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.970\nbe familiar with, Seurat who is known for\npainting with dots.\n\n149\n00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.410\nSeurat knew a lot about dots,\nif you remember after school TV.\n\n150\n00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:25.460\nAnd also, another equally famous painter,\nSalvador Dali.\n\n151\n00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.640\nYou may or may not have heard of\neither one of these artists, but\n\n152\n00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.620\nthey are both very famous in their\nown right for a lot of reasons.\n\n153\n00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.850\nBut Seurat's work is globally known,\nworld wide, famous all over the world.\n\n154\n00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.500\nAnd the interesting thing about Seurat,\nand it's also the interesting thing about\n\n155\n00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:45.140\nsome Dali's work because they both use\nperspective shift to be able to paint and\n\n156\n00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:49.940\ncreate illusion, Seraut painted with dots\nas opposed to brush stokes of color.\n\n157\n00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.600\nAnd so, if you stood up front and\nvery close,\n\n158\n00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.460\nalmost immediately on top\nof a Seurat painting,\n\n159\n00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.170\nyou don't actually see the picture,\nyou see the individual dots of color.\n\n160\n00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:03.070\nIt's very hard to make out shapes and\nunderstand the overall aspects of\n\n161\n00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:07.310\nthe picture, but as you step back to\na focal plane distance of 5 feet, 10 feet\n\n162\n00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:12.510\nwhatever it is, all of a sudden the\nindividual dots morph into a landscape.\n\n163\n00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.350\nAnd you literally will see\nthe entire picture come to life.\n\n164\n00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:19.300\nYou see individual people, you see water,\nyou see boats, you see all sorts of stuff.\n\n165\n00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.520\nDali has a very famous picture,\nmany, many of them, but\n\n166\n00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.810\none of particular I'm thinking of,\nthe head of Lincoln.\n\n167\n00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.100\nIf you've never seen it,\nyou can Google it.\n\n168\n00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.170\nBut if you look up his\nportrait of Lincoln,\n\n169\n00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:31.680\nit's hanging in the Dali Museum in St.\nPete in Florida.\n\n170\n00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.980\nAnd I actually went to\nsee it not too long ago.\n\n171\n00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.120\nAnd my wife and I did this, was so cool.\n\n172\n00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.020\nSo you go and the picture is actually\nthere, it's literally probably-\n\n173\n00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:41.790\n&gt;&gt; I've been there, it's cool.\n\n174\n00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:44.210\n&gt;&gt; You can walk up to it, and literally\nyou can stand right in front of it.\n\n175\n00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:45.450\nBut it's there on the wall.\n\n176\n00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:48.660\nAnd if you take the tour,\nthey do this whole big like, let me\n\n177\n00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:52.653\ndo the reveal thing, and we dont want to\ndo that we just went and kind of hung out.\n\n178\n00:07:52.653 --> 00:07:56.053\nAnd we kinda mooched onto someone else's\ntour, and just walked around listened\n\n179\n00:07:56.053 --> 00:07:58.457\na little bit, then we go off and\nlook at another picture.\n\n180\n00:07:58.457 --> 00:08:00.185\nDon't tell anybody,\nyou're not supposed to do that.\n\n181\n00:08:00.185 --> 00:08:02.994\nBut when we got to the Lincoln thing,\nthe Lincoln painting, so\n\n182\n00:08:02.994 --> 00:08:05.750\nthey have a line on the floor\nwhere you're supposed to stand.\n\n183\n00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.980\nSo they tell you stand behind the line,\nit comes into focus, stand in front of it,\n\n184\n00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:09.560\nyou can't see it.\n\n185\n00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.980\nIf you've been there,\ndid you do the Lincoln painting when you-\n\n186\n00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:13.990\n&gt;&gt; I can't remember, it was a while ago.\n\n187\n00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:16.938\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so if you haven't seen it,\nyou can't really Google it and\n\n188\n00:08:16.938 --> 00:08:20.331\nget a picture and get an understanding\nof it on, you gotta see it in person.\n\n189\n00:08:20.331 --> 00:08:24.190\nBut the idea is it's all these what\nlook like random squares, right?\n\n190\n00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:28.080\nAnd if you stand too close to it,\nyou have no idea there's a portrait there.\n\n191\n00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:33.120\nYou step back to this line that they have,\nand all of a sudden Lincoln's head\n\n192\n00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.130\ncomes into view, and literally you\nsee a portrait of Abraham Lincoln.\n\n193\n00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:39.510\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; But it materializes out of thin air.\n\n194\n00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.170\nIt is the freakiest thing in the world.\n\n195\n00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:42.066\nSo, it is really,\n\n196\n00:08:42.066 --> 00:08:46.150\nreally interesting because these are two\npractical examples of steganography\n\n197\n00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:50.990\nWe're hiding something inside of\nthe common carrier, inside the painting.\n\n198\n00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:55.760\nThere are these hidden items of data\nthat when looked at a certain way,\n\n199\n00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:56.750\nsuddenly become apparent.\n\n200\n00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:59.270\nBut if you don't look at them a certain\nway, you don't know they're there.\n\n201\n00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:01.130\nSo this are just practical\nexamples of this.\n\n202\n00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:05.523\nBut we have vocabulary, and I mentioned it\nalready, but just to go over it formally\n\n203\n00:09:05.523 --> 00:09:07.870\nfor you, that is important\nwith regards to steganography.\n\n204\n00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.670\nI mentioned the payload,\nI mentioned the carrier.\n\n205\n00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:13.320\nI don't believe I mentioned\nthe actual channel itself,\n\n206\n00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.912\nbut let's talk about all three.\n\n207\n00:09:14.912 --> 00:09:17.810\nThe payload is the data to\nbe covertly communicated,\n\n208\n00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:19.290\nso it's what we want to hide.\n\n209\n00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:21.170\nThe carrier is the signal or the stream or\n\n210\n00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:24.270\nthe file itself that we're gonna\nhide the payload inside of.\n\n211\n00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:25.610\nThat was whole banana thing,\n\n212\n00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:27.870\nthe outer part of the banana\nis gonna be the carrier.\n\n213\n00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:31.500\nThe inside itself, the fruit,\nis the payload, we talked about that.\n\n214\n00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.840\nWe're gonna now commonly refer to that\nas the banana analogy going forward.\n\n215\n00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.030\nAnd then the channel is\nthe actual medium that is used.\n\n216\n00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:41.130\nThis may be things like a still photo,\nvideo, music.\n\n217\n00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:47.390\nSo the actual overarching category\nthat we are using to contain the data.\n\n218\n00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:50.570\nSo if it is a still photo,\na picture, if it is written word,\n\n219\n00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:52.990\nif it is something like that,\nwe call that the channel.\n\n220\n00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:56.270\nSo the ideas behind steganography\nare fairly straightforward.\n\n221\n00:09:56.270 --> 00:10:01.510\nWe actually go into great detail\non how to deal with steganography\n\n222\n00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:05.840\nin another set of shows not\nrelated to the ECES topics at all.\n\n223\n00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.050\nBut another EC council course.\n\n224\n00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:11.270\nThe certified hacking\nforensic investigator CHFI.\n\n225\n00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:14.940\nI do a whole series on steganography\nthere in much greater detail.\n\n226\n00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:18.730\nWe demo steganography tools for you,\nshow you how to stego a picture and\n\n227\n00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:21.210\nthen unstego it, and show you the results.\n\n228\n00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:22.920\nSo you may wanna take a look at those.\n\n229\n00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.810\nIf you are subscribing to the whole\nITProTV library, you'll have a chance to\n\n230\n00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:30.370\nsee my smiling face yet\nagain going through that with you.\n\n231\n00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:33.690\nDaniel actually presented that\nmaterial with me, so we do those.\n\n232\n00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:34.940\nSo, kind of interesting there, but\n\n233\n00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.190\nyou could certainly learn more\nabout steganography in general,\n\n234\n00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:38.790\njust by reading up a little bit on it.\n\n235\n00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:42.510\nSteganalysis is the ability to\nbe able to analyze images and\n\n236\n00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:44.695\ndetect whether there's been\nsteganography applied.\n\n237\n00:10:44.695 --> 00:10:46.400\nAnd we have tools that\nallow us to do this.\n\n238\n00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.650\nSo we can use StegDetect.\n\n239\n00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:52.980\nThere's a whole bunch of different tools\nthat can be used to examine something and\n\n240\n00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:56.480\nto see whether or not it actually\nhas steganographically modified data\n\n241\n00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.300\nsitting inside of it.\n\n242\n00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.370\nSo we can essentially examine or\n\n243\n00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:02.910\nanalyze a file looking for\nevidence of manipulation, looking for\n\n244\n00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:06.180\nevidence of modification of the least\nsignificant bits or the whitespace.\n\n245\n00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:09.420\nSo kind of interesting when you think\nthrough that, but that's what we do.\n\n246\n00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.510\nThere are two methods, or\n\n247\n00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:14.980\ntwo methodologies,\nthat steganalysis typically will employ.\n\n248\n00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:15.800\nOne is called RQP.\n\n249\n00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:21.760\nThis is Raw Quick Pair method, or\nthe raw quick pair method analysis.\n\n250\n00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.360\nThe other is called Chi square.\n\n251\n00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.170\nC, h, i. I. Chi square.\n\n252\n00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:27.970\nI guess sometimes people\nwould mispronounce it, chai.\n\n253\n00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:31.460\nCuz I've heard people say chai,\nbut chai is spelled as C, H, A, I.\n\n254\n00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:32.580\nIf I'm not mistaken, right?\n\n255\n00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:33.160\n&gt;&gt; Chai lattes, yeah.\n\n256\n00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.710\n&gt;&gt; Like chai lattes except we're\ntalking about chi squares.\n\n257\n00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:38.810\nBut, so\nit's a chi square analysis method as well.\n\n258\n00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:43.687\nThe RQP method is based on statistical\nanalysis of the numbers of\n\n259\n00:11:43.687 --> 00:11:48.668\nunique colors and close color\npairs within the image map itself.\n\n260\n00:11:48.668 --> 00:11:50.656\nSo we're looking at all\nthe different colors and\n\n261\n00:11:50.656 --> 00:11:52.970\npotential combinations of colors,\ncolor pairs.\n\n262\n00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:55.520\nWe analyze all those, and then we look for\n\n263\n00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:00.500\nleast significant bits that are gonna be\nleft over, and we look for LSB embedding.\n\n264\n00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:04.000\nIn other words, manipulation of\nthe data in the least significant bits.\n\n265\n00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.360\nBecause normally, least significant\nbits would essentially be white space.\n\n266\n00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.810\nAnd if we do this in an image,\n\n267\n00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:12.650\nif that white space has been manipulated\nwith data, and it's not truly white but\n\n268\n00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:16.430\nhas value associated with it,\nit will stand out when we do the analysis.\n\n269\n00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:17.940\nSo it's interesting,\nit's almost like crating a-\n\n270\n00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:18.850\n&gt;&gt; But not just to our naked eye,\n\n271\n00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:20.160\nthis is something that we would need\n\n272\n00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.920\nto use software unless-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no,\n\n273\n00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:25.040\nyou can't do this with the naked eye, you\ngotta have computer software to do this.\n\n274\n00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.693\nBut it would be like taking the color\nwheel, right, from like a paint store,\n\n275\n00:12:28.693 --> 00:12:32.181\nholding up the color wheel and saying,\nokay, all the colors map out, and\n\n276\n00:12:32.181 --> 00:12:36.119\nthan all the stuff over here that's not on\nthe color wheel, let's examine all that\n\n277\n00:12:36.119 --> 00:12:39.356\nstuff and see if there's anything\nin there that may be of interest.\n\n278\n00:12:39.356 --> 00:12:42.866\nCuz that's over simplifying, but\napproximately what we would be doing with\n\n279\n00:12:42.866 --> 00:12:45.464\nthis particular analysis,\nlooking at pairs of colors.\n\n280\n00:12:45.464 --> 00:12:47.420\nRed has a lot of different shades of red.\n\n281\n00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.190\nSo we look at different shades, but\n\n282\n00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:50.960\nthen if it's yellow we'd\nlook at shades of yellow.\n\n283\n00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.520\nAnd then when we get\neverything eliminated,\n\n284\n00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.960\nwhatever's left over's where we focus.\n\n285\n00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.415\nSo it's kind of interesting approach.\n\n286\n00:12:55.415 --> 00:12:57.542\nChai square, now you've got me saying it.\n\n287\n00:12:57.542 --> 00:12:59.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Chi-square analysis.\n\n288\n00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.510\nThis is also mathematical.\n\n289\n00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:05.500\nAll these approaches are manipulating and\nusing math in some way.\n\n290\n00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:09.430\nBut we're doing a calculation and\na comparison.\n\n291\n00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:12.810\nWe're looking at theoretical\nversus actual calculated\n\n292\n00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:14.460\npopulation differences of the bits.\n\n293\n00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.980\nMeaning, we're looking at\nthe overall number of bits, and\n\n294\n00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.850\nthen we're looking at information\ncontained in those bits.\n\n295\n00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:22.790\nAnd then we're looking\nat what the theoretical\n\n296\n00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:25.930\namount of information in the file\nshould be versus what the actual\n\n297\n00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:28.350\namount of information in the file\ncontained in the bits is.\n\n298\n00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:32.410\nAnd the delta between those two is\nthen used to examine the file bits and\n\n299\n00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:34.920\nsee whether or\nnot there's been manipulation.\n\n300\n00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.680\nThese are, again,\nsoftware based approaches,\n\n301\n00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:41.360\nas Cherokee pointed out, that we will\nuse to attempt to understand whether or\n\n302\n00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.360\nnot there has been stagenogrophy applied.\n\n303\n00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.120\nAnd if there is, to what to degree, and\n\n304\n00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.580\ntry to separate it essentially\nfrom the rest of the data.\n\n305\n00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:52.190\nIn theory, stitching back together and\nreproducing what that may look like.\n\n306\n00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:55.630\nSo, just interesting approaches,\nall software driven, may or\n\n307\n00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:57.390\nmay not ever interact with them.\n\n308\n00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:59.370\nIf you're not a forensic investigator,\n\n309\n00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:02.150\nit's highly unlikely you\nwould be interacting with\n\n310\n00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:06.170\nany kind of steganographic information in\nthe first place because unless somebody\n\n311\n00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:10.040\njust does it to test it and gives you\na file, you wouldn't even see it anyway.\n\n312\n00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.730\nBut unless they told you it was\nsteganographically modified, and\n\n313\n00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:16.035\nyou downloaded a tool to play with it to\nsee it, you'd have no way of knowing it.\n\n314\n00:14:16.035 --> 00:14:18.100\nYou'd have to do this kind of stuff for\na living and\n\n315\n00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:21.420\nhave tools that allow you to see this to\nactually understand what's happening.\n\n316\n00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:24.504\nBut it is kind of interesting, so it's\njust one of those things that you wanna\n\n317\n00:14:24.504 --> 00:14:26.402\nbe aware of when we think\nabout cryptography and\n\n318\n00:14:26.402 --> 00:14:28.357\nthe applications in\nthe world of cryptography.\n\n319\n00:14:28.357 --> 00:14:32.430\nThis is one of those places where we\ndo actually see cryptography being\n\n320\n00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:35.328\nbrought to bear and\nbeing used all the time because\n\n321\n00:14:35.328 --> 00:14:38.503\nbad actors trying to secret\ninformation out of a system\n\n322\n00:14:38.503 --> 00:14:43.150\nare gonna usually use steganography to\nsend it out without us being aware of it.\n\n323\n00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:46.400\nSo it is a fairly common thing\nthat we come across when we do\n\n324\n00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.970\nforensic investigations.\n\n325\n00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:51.960\nIt's fairly common when we do\nthe analysis after an attack and\n\n326\n00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.480\nlook at what may have occurred.\n\n327\n00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:58.130\nIt's a common approach and technique we\nmay use for vulnerability assessments and\n\n328\n00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:02.438\nor for penetration testing where we may\ntry to sneak data into a system and or\n\n329\n00:15:02.438 --> 00:15:05.180\nsneak data out of a system\nas proof we were there.\n\n330\n00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.870\nOr to infect a system during\na vulnerability assessment,\n\n331\n00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:09.060\nsee how weak it may be.\n\n332\n00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:12.896\nSo there are reasons why these approaches\nmay be used in the broader context of\n\n333\n00:15:12.896 --> 00:15:14.146\ninformation security.\n\n334\n00:15:14.146 --> 00:15:15.922\nSo it's just kind of interesting, right?\n\n335\n00:15:15.922 --> 00:15:18.151\nPlus it's really cool geeky stuff,\nso it's fun to do, right?\n\n336\n00:15:18.151 --> 00:15:19.045\n&gt;&gt; I think it is amazing, yeah.\n\n337\n00:15:19.045 --> 00:15:20.508\n&gt;&gt; It is kinda cool when\nyou think about it.\n\n338\n00:15:20.508 --> 00:15:24.949\nAll right, so let's talk a little bit\nabout one of our favorite three-letter\n\n339\n00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:28.460\nacronym agencies, the NSA,\nthe National Security Agency.\n\n340\n00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:32.790\nThe NSA has for many, many years\n\n341\n00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:37.800\nkept kind of a two-tiered running\nsystem of cryptographic algorithms.\n\n342\n00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.040\nThey have what are known\nas Suite A algorithms.\n\n343\n00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.278\nSuite as in S, U, I, T, E.\n\n344\n00:15:42.278 --> 00:15:44.467\nSuite A and Suite B.\n\n345\n00:15:44.467 --> 00:15:47.765\nSuite A algorithms are gonna be\nconfidential, they are not published,\n\n346\n00:15:47.765 --> 00:15:50.862\nthey are used for secret,\ntop secret government communications.\n\n347\n00:15:50.862 --> 00:15:55.067\nAnd we have no knowledge of them other\nthan the fact that whatever's on this list\n\n348\n00:15:55.067 --> 00:15:58.163\nIs used by government entities\nto securely communicate.\n\n349\n00:15:58.163 --> 00:16:00.600\nWe don't know what's on the list,\nwe have no knowledge of it.\n\n350\n00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:04.570\nBut the Suite A Cryptographic\nsolution is not made public.\n\n351\n00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:07.020\nSo, we don't really know about it,\nbut we know it exists.\n\n352\n00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:11.760\nThe Suite B Cryptography, suite from\nthe NSA is commercially available and\n\n353\n00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:12.890\nit's used all the time.\n\n354\n00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:16.440\nIt's implemented in most modern\nsoftware in one form or another.\n\n355\n00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:20.960\nAnd when we use it,\nwe are using algorithms,\n\n356\n00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:25.650\nhashing algorithms, public and\nprivate key pair algorithms, and\n\n357\n00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:31.120\nall sorts of key exchange solutions\nthat are recommended by NSA,\n\n358\n00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.820\nthat have been published to\nmade available and test it and\n\n359\n00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:39.580\nbedded through NIST, at a been certified\nfor use by the federal government for\n\n360\n00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:42.550\ncommunication that takes place in\nthe real world outside of the top\n\n361\n00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:47.049\nsecret channels that are used by Suite\nA or used to propagate through Suite A.\n\n362\n00:16:47.049 --> 00:16:51.380\nAnd that's a whole bunch of stuff on the\nsuite B list that we can be made aware,\n\n363\n00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:53.030\nwe're gonna show you\nthis in just a second.\n\n364\n00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:55.968\nWe have a nice little list of stuff and\nwe'll publish it up for you.\n\n365\n00:16:55.968 --> 00:17:00.660\nIn addition, algorithms are ranked\naccording to this thought process or\n\n366\n00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:04.480\nclassified in a scale from\ntype one to type four.\n\n367\n00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.610\nType one being the highest classification,\nthe most secure.\n\n368\n00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:11.190\nType four being the lowest classification,\nnot formally certified for\n\n369\n00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:14.210\nany government usage although they\nmay be used in the private sector.\n\n370\n00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:16.930\nI already show you some examples of\nthe algorithms that exist on this\n\n371\n00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:17.730\nlist as well.\n\n372\n00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:20.810\nSo, we can took a look\nreal quick on my screen.\n\n373\n00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:22.160\nWe will see, can you go full screen?\n\n374\n00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.100\nCuz we're blocking half of what's there,\nand I can't scroll down anymore.\n\n375\n00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:27.590\nCan we go full screen, please,\nso we could take a look at that?\n\n376\n00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:28.670\nThank you very much.\n\n377\n00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:31.360\nSo, you could see there that\nthe algorithms are classed by\n\n378\n00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:32.800\ntype one through type four.\n\n379\n00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.100\nType one highest, type four lowest.\n\n380\n00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.660\nGave you some examples of these, are these\nare not the most recent examples by\n\n381\n00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:41.750\nthe way, but they certainly\nare in usually will find them or\n\n382\n00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:43.080\nat least find the information about them.\n\n383\n00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.895\nUp there somewhere new,\nAS is relatively new but some, I mean,\n\n384\n00:17:45.895 --> 00:17:46.705\nyou may never have heard of.\n\n385\n00:17:46.705 --> 00:17:49.385\nYou probably have not heard of type one\n\n386\n00:17:49.385 --> 00:17:51.875\nalgorithms before unless you're\nin the government or military.\n\n387\n00:17:51.875 --> 00:17:53.445\nYou may not have come across these.\n\n388\n00:17:53.445 --> 00:17:55.395\n&gt;&gt;

Makes sense.\n\n404\n00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:39.020\n&gt;&gt; Type four, as I said, not certified for\ngovernment usage, but there may\n\n405\n00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:43.330\nbe public or private sector algorithms\nthat exist on the list at that level.\n\n406\n00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:46.660\nSo, things that would be not tested and\ncertified for government use but\n\n407\n00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.940\nare still available would\nfall into that category.\n\n408\n00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:53.551\nThe commercial NSA Suite, which is\nthe Suite B solution that we talked about,\n\n409\n00:18:53.551 --> 00:18:56.500\nare includes the following algorithms for\nvarious things.\n\n410\n00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:57.780\nYou could see them there.\n\n411\n00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:02.130\nFor encryption, AES, which is,\nas you know, the fifth 197 standard.\n\n412\n00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:04.560\nWe talked about that in prior episodes.\n\n413\n00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:09.152\nHashing, SHA or Secure Hashing Algorithm,\n\n414\n00:19:09.152 --> 00:19:13.690\nFipps 180-4, Digital signature, we have\nEllipticurve digital signature algorithm,\n\n415\n00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:18.032\none of your favorites, CCDSA and\nalso RSA for digital signature.\n\n416\n00:19:18.032 --> 00:19:20.912\nBoth Fipps 186-4,\nyou'll see for key change,\n\n417\n00:19:20.912 --> 00:19:25.360\nwe have Ellipticurve Diffie-Hellman,\nso we've talked about that before.\n\n418\n00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.130\nThat's NIST SP 856 A.\n\n419\n00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:32.021\nThe key exchange, Diffie-Hellman itself,\nnot just elliptic curve,\n\n420\n00:19:32.021 --> 00:19:33.330\nbut Diffie-Hellman.\n\n421\n00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:37.100\nRC 3526 and also key exchange RSA.\n\n422\n00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:41.630\nLet's test the 856 B, I believe Rev one,\nif I remember correctly, but\n\n423\n00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:43.680\nthat should be the most recent version for\nthat.\n\n424\n00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:48.960\nBut you'll see these are all specified\nin the commercial NSA Suite in Suite B.\n\n425\n00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.620\nAre that can either be used or\nmade available and\n\n426\n00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:55.550\ntalked about outside of top secret\ncommunications for the government and\n\n427\n00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:59.330\nare published and are bedded and you can\nactually can find information about.\n\n428\n00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:02.970\nAnd are used by the federal government for\nnon-top secret communication and\n\n429\n00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:05.500\nfor commercial in\n\n430\n00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:09.210\nprivate sector commercial communication\nare implemented in a lot of systems as\n\n431\n00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:13.100\nwell because a lot of businesses will\nrefer to the MSA commercial suite.\n\n432\n00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.580\nAnd implement Aspect 7 for\nvarious cryptographic protection.\n\n433\n00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.680\nSo, we see that as well.\n\n434\n00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:23.500\nWe would consider this to be obviously\nvetted and therefore, more often than not,\n\n435\n00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:25.220\nwe would call them secure.\n\n436\n00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:27.150\nMost of the things on this list,\nas you can see,\n\n437\n00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:30.570\nto this day continue to be talked\nabout and are considered secure.\n\n438\n00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:34.130\nBut keep in mind, just like Desks would've\nbeen on this list at a certain point years\n\n439\n00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:37.075\nand years and years ago,\nthings do change over time, right.\n\n440\n00:20:37.075 --> 00:20:41.240\nIn over time, what was considered secure\nnow may not be secure in the future.\n\n441\n00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.380\nAnd we just want to know that\nat some point that may change.\n\n442\n00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:48.645\nBut at least for now, that would be what\na traditional sweepy list may look like.\n\n443\n00:20:48.645 --> 00:20:51.530\n&gt;&gt; You've covered several\ndifferent implementations,\n\n444\n00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:54.140\nboth in our personal lives and\nbusiness entities.\n\n445\n00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:57.410\nWe've even talked about governments and\nwe've had a few tangents here and\n\n446\n00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:00.950\nthere, but I think that brings us to\nthe end of this particular chapter.\n\n447\n00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:02.990\nSo, thank you, Adam, for joining us today.\n\n448\n00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:04.942\nAnd thank you ladies and\ngentlemen for tuning in.\n\n449\n00:21:04.942 --> 00:21:06.714\nBut we're gonna go ahead and sign off for\n\n450\n00:21:06.714 --> 00:21:10.168\nthis show, see you next time here at\nITProTV, remember I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n451\n00:21:10.168 --> 00:21:11.516\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:16.055\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:16.055 --> 00:00:19.308\nIn this episode we'll begin\ndiscussing cryptanalysis.\n\n8\n00:00:19.308 --> 00:00:22.145\nAnd with is today,\nwe have Mr Adam Gordon in studios.\n\n9\n00:00:22.145 --> 00:00:24.190\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n10\n00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.677\n&gt;&gt; Howdy, howdy, howdy.\n\n11\n00:00:25.677 --> 00:00:29.727\n[COUGH] I would say happy, happy,\nhappy, but I'm just happy, happy.\n\n12\n00:00:29.727 --> 00:00:30.712\nNot happy, happy, happy.\n\n13\n00:00:30.712 --> 00:00:32.771\nSo, howdy is

00:00:38.125\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, we're gonna continue talking.\n\n17\n00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:42.712\nAnd I thought it would be, not only\ninteresting, but important for us to spend\n\n18\n00:00:42.712 --> 00:00:47.509\na little bit of time talking about all\nthe other thing I've already spoken about,\n\n19\n00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:50.240\nwhich is cryptanalysis\nof the cryptography.\n\n20\n00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.772\nAnd what I mean by that is,\n\n21\n00:00:51.772 --> 00:00:56.652\nhow do we take all the information we've\nbeen through in all these prior episodes,\n\n22\n00:00:56.652 --> 00:01:00.993\nsymmetric, asymmetric cryptography,\nhashing, digitally signing?\n\n23\n00:01:00.993 --> 00:01:05.608\nHow do we encrypt, how do we decrypt\nwhen we have knowledge of the system?\n\n24\n00:01:05.608 --> 00:01:07.223\nAnd how do we understand the system?\n\n25\n00:01:07.223 --> 00:01:11.777\nWhatever the cryptosystem may be,\nthe algorithm, the key, the plain text,\n\n26\n00:01:11.777 --> 00:01:15.436\nthe cypher text,\nthe number of round functions, the XORing.\n\n27\n00:01:15.436 --> 00:01:17.460\nAll the things we've been\nthrough that we've talked about.\n\n28\n00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.440\nHow do we take all of that?\n\n29\n00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.206\nHow do we then from the attacker\nperspective step back and\n\n30\n00:01:23.206 --> 00:01:27.363\nbegin to think about how we can\nuse pieces of that information to\n\n31\n00:01:27.363 --> 00:01:29.488\npotentially break the system?\n\n32\n00:01:29.488 --> 00:01:34.293\nAnd this is the thought process and the\nconversation about the thought process,\n\n33\n00:01:34.293 --> 00:01:39.096\nthat allows a certified encryption\nspecialist, an IT security professional,\n\n34\n00:01:39.096 --> 00:01:40.805\nto think like the attacker.\n\n35\n00:01:40.805 --> 00:01:46.208\nThis is where we decide, where we\nunderstand how to go on the offense so\n\n36\n00:01:46.208 --> 00:01:50.981\nthat we have a better defense\nagainst these kinds of attacks.\n\n37\n00:01:50.981 --> 00:01:54.971\nAnd we can proactively, if possible,\ntry to prevent them before they occur.\n\n38\n00:01:54.971 --> 00:01:57.563\nNow, we're gonna remind ourselves of\na couple of things as we get started.\n\n39\n00:01:57.563 --> 00:02:00.887\nNumber one, we've talked\nextensively in many of our prior\n\n40\n00:02:00.887 --> 00:02:05.819\nepisodes about Kerckhoffs' principle, the\nidea of keeping the private keys secure.\n\n41\n00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:10.739\nAllowing, in theory, the attacker,\nthe bad actor, the threat source, whatever\n\n42\n00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.729\nyou wanna call them, to have access to,\nand, potentially, directly get firsthand\n\n43\n00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:20.475\ninformation, and knowledge of almost\nevery other aspect of the cryptosystem.\n\n44\n00:02:20.475 --> 00:02:22.980\nWe would allow them to see\nthe cypher text in theory, right?\n\n45\n00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.190\nThat wouldn't be a problem.\n\n46\n00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.141\nWe would tell them, if they wanted\nto know or somehow found out,\n\n47\n00:02:27.141 --> 00:02:29.011\nwhat the algorithm that was being used.\n\n48\n00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:30.850\nHey, we're using RSA, right?\n\n49\n00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.410\nSo we would let them know that.\n\n50\n00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.187\nWhat we wouldn't expose to\nthem would be the private key.\n\n51\n00:02:35.187 --> 00:02:38.556\nThey may find the public key if\nthey could zero in on the user, or\n\n52\n00:02:38.556 --> 00:02:41.890\ngroup of users,\nthat may be involved in a transaction.\n\n53\n00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.840\nRemember we may use the sender's\nprivate or public key, or\n\n54\n00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.568\nthe recipient's private or public key,\ndepending on what we're doing.\n\n55\n00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:53.315\nSo for instance, if an attacker,\nperhaps named Jessica, for instance.\n\n56\n00:02:53.315 --> 00:02:54.893\nLet's just say that's our attacker.\n\n57\n00:02:54.893 --> 00:02:59.548\nIf Jessica was gonna go out and\ntry to potentially grab information about\n\n58\n00:02:59.548 --> 00:03:02.686\na secure communication\nbetween Cherokee and I.\n\n59\n00:03:02.686 --> 00:03:08.079\nAnd Jessica knew that the both\nof us were the parties involved,\n\n60\n00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:13.901\nshe may be able to go out and\nfind Cherokee's and/or my public key.\n\n61\n00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:17.280\nShe may in theory as an attacker\nbe able to get the public key.\n\n62\n00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.069\nBut Kerckhoff says keep\nthat private key secure.\n\n63\n00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.964\nAnd if we do that then it's gonna be a lot\nless likely that an attacker can gain\n\n64\n00:03:24.964 --> 00:03:28.712\nenough information that they\ncan actually figure out what\n\n65\n00:03:28.712 --> 00:03:32.410\nthe message is that we're sending back and\nforth.\n\n66\n00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.197\nDo you have your key?\n\n67\n00:03:33.197 --> 00:03:33.881\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n68\n00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:34.629\n&gt;&gt; You do?\nOkay, well, you didn't have it,\n\n69\n00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:35.235\nyou went and grabbed it from storage,.\n\n70\n00:03:35.235 --> 00:03:37.675\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But she has.\n\n71\n00:03:37.675 --> 00:03:38.786\n&gt;&gt; There we go, there we go.\n\n72\n00:03:38.786 --> 00:03:40.265\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee has her private key.\n\n73\n00:03:40.265 --> 00:03:42.317\nSo, remember she's the key mistress.\n\n74\n00:03:42.317 --> 00:03:45.815\nShe's keeping track of our keys,\nshe's securely storing them for us.\n\n75\n00:03:45.815 --> 00:03:46.733\nWell, for herself anyway, right?\n\n76\n00:03:46.733 --> 00:03:50.273\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And as a result, she's gotta make sure,\n\n77\n00:03:50.273 --> 00:03:53.442\nno matter what happens,\nthat she keeps that private key secure.\n\n78\n00:03:53.442 --> 00:03:57.516\nSo what we're gonna focus on in\nthis episode is a discussion around\n\n79\n00:03:57.516 --> 00:04:02.607\ncryptanalysis, the idea, the art, the\nprocess, the thought process of how we,\n\n80\n00:04:02.607 --> 00:04:06.775\nas bad actors, would attempt to\nbreak cryptography protections.\n\n81\n00:04:06.775 --> 00:04:11.907\nConfidentiality that has been applied by\nsomebody like you, a certified encryption\n\n82\n00:04:11.907 --> 00:04:17.100\nspecialist, an IT professional,\na security professional of some kind.\n\n83\n00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.764\nSo, we're gonna try to decipher\nmessages by gaining bits and\n\n84\n00:04:20.764 --> 00:04:25.072\npieces of the information that may or\nmay not be readily available to us.\n\n85\n00:04:25.072 --> 00:04:29.207\nMaybe we'll figure out how to trick\nCherokee into giving up that key if we can\n\n86\n00:04:29.207 --> 00:04:29.733\ndo that.\n\n87\n00:04:29.733 --> 00:04:31.665\nMaybe we'll send her out of the room-\n&gt;&gt; I might have a price.\n\n88\n00:04:31.665 --> 00:04:33.877\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or we may send you out of the room,\n\n89\n00:04:33.877 --> 00:04:35.646\nright, on an errand, quote unquote.\n\n90\n00:04:35.646 --> 00:04:36.969\n&gt;&gt; Doughnuts, that's it!\n\n91\n00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:38.025\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Something like that, right?\n\n92\n00:04:38.025 --> 00:04:39.045\n&gt;&gt; Cupcakes.\n&gt;&gt; And while you're out,\n\n93\n00:04:39.045 --> 00:04:40.170\nwe may try to steal that key.\n\n94\n00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.354\nNow you mentioned having a price.\n\n95\n00:04:41.354 --> 00:04:44.918\nInteresting, there was a study\ndone a few years back in Europe,\n\n96\n00:04:44.918 --> 00:04:46.773\nin the UK actually of all places.\n\n97\n00:04:46.773 --> 00:04:51.300\nAnd one of those random surveys\nthat people often will do.\n\n98\n00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.103\nAnd they stop people on\nthe street,people doing the survey.\n\n99\n00:04:54.103 --> 00:04:57.257\nAnd in a business area, kind of a down\ntime district where you would have a lot\n\n100\n00:04:57.257 --> 00:04:58.903\nof office workers, people like that.\n\n101\n00:04:58.903 --> 00:05:01.437\nAnd they said to them hey,\nwe're doing a quick survey.\n\n102\n00:05:01.437 --> 00:05:03.410\nCan we ask you some questions?\n\n103\n00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.810\nAnd it was around whether or not people\nwould give up passwords at work.\n\n104\n00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.098\nWhat would it take if we were to\ntry to get a password from you.\n\n105\n00:05:11.098 --> 00:05:12.357\nDo you have a price, essentially.\n\n106\n00:05:12.357 --> 00:05:13.238\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n107\n00:05:13.238 --> 00:05:18.066\nthe average outcome of this was\nultimately that most people would\n\n108\n00:05:18.066 --> 00:05:21.850\ngive up their password at work for\na chocolate bar.\n\n109\n00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:22.789\nNot just-\n&gt;&gt; Shut up, no way.\n\n110\n00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:23.941\n&gt;&gt; Not just, not just a, no no.\n\n111\n00:05:23.941 --> 00:05:28.026\nNot just a chocolate bar, but\na Snickers chocolate bar.\n\n112\n00:05:28.026 --> 00:05:28.602\n&gt;&gt; That's crazy.\n\n113\n00:05:28.602 --> 00:05:31.653\n&gt;&gt; So I had a banana yesterday for you.\n\n114\n00:05:31.653 --> 00:05:33.775\nAnd I know that didn't go well,\nyou didn't like that.\n\n115\n00:05:33.775 --> 00:05:37.310\nCheck out the prior episode about the\nwhole, I like bananas but not really thing\n\n116\n00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.593\nthat Cherokee and I went through-\n&gt;&gt; Banana pudding, maybe.\n\n117\n00:05:40.593 --> 00:05:41.829\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But no, no you had your chance.\n\n118\n00:05:41.829 --> 00:05:44.101\nThe banana people called,\nthey're not happy.\n\n119\n00:05:44.101 --> 00:05:47.988\nBut that's a whole separate story,\nbut Snickers bar was-\n\n120\n00:05:47.988 --> 00:05:48.837\n&gt;&gt; I can't believe that seriously-\n\n121\n00:05:48.837 --> 00:05:50.608\n&gt;&gt; Was the actual lowest common\n\n122\n00:05:50.608 --> 00:05:55.631\ndenominator, people said they'd sell\ntheir companies out for a Snickers bar.\n\n123\n00:05:55.631 --> 00:05:58.555\nSo, you never know,\nyou joke around people having a price.\n\n124\n00:05:58.555 --> 00:06:00.239\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Having a price.\n\n125\n00:06:00.239 --> 00:06:03.774\nBut sometimes it may just be, and\nif you get them on the right day,\n\n126\n00:06:03.774 --> 00:06:08.430\nit may just be nothing more than the\nleftover Halloween candy, and we're in.\n\n127\n00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.683\nSo, just keep that in\nmind as we get started.\n\n128\n00:06:10.683 --> 00:06:14.167\nBut the idea is gonna be, we're gonna\ntry to figure out different approaches,\n\n129\n00:06:14.167 --> 00:06:16.305\ndifferent ways that we\ncan come at this problem.\n\n130\n00:06:16.305 --> 00:06:21.254\nThis problem is, I've got several blank\nspaces on this mythical chart I'm\n\n131\n00:06:21.254 --> 00:06:26.069\ntrying to create about how I can map\nout the transactions that are secure.\n\n132\n00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:30.773\nAnd how as an attacker, I can figure\nout where the point of weakness is.\n\n133\n00:06:30.773 --> 00:06:33.930\nI've got the plain text sitting over here.\n\n134\n00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:38.507\nBut it's highly unlikely I'm gonna find\nthat, because if I have the plain text\n\n135\n00:06:38.507 --> 00:06:42.971\nthen what I have is, in theory, a very,\nvery important piece of the puzzle.\n\n136\n00:06:42.971 --> 00:06:46.860\nAnd we're gonna talk about an attack where\nwe may actually have the plain text.\n\n137\n00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.067\nSo we may be able to choose our plain\ntext, and the result in cipher text.\n\n138\n00:06:51.067 --> 00:06:53.393\nThis will be what's called\na chosen plain text attack.\n\n139\n00:06:53.393 --> 00:06:54.555\nWe'll talk about that in a minute.\n\n140\n00:06:54.555 --> 00:06:57.580\nBut we may have the plain text,\nthat would be one piece of the puzzle.\n\n141\n00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.800\nWe may understand the algorithm,\nthat's another piece to the puzzle.\n\n142\n00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:06.402\nWe may understand one of the two keys,\nthe public key in theory.\n\n143\n00:07:06.402 --> 00:07:08.340\nCuz, typically,\nwe're not gonna know the private key.\n\n144\n00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.051\nIf we know the private key, we're done.\n\n145\n00:07:10.051 --> 00:07:11.698\nWe don't need the chocolate,\nwe don't need anything.\n\n146\n00:07:11.698 --> 00:07:14.250\nWe go home, that's it, we're done.\n\n147\n00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:15.980\nSo we don't probably have the private key.\n\n148\n00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.273\nOur goal, always, is to find\nthe private key without exception.\n\n149\n00:07:19.273 --> 00:07:22.349\nBut we may know the public key\nin a private-public key pair, or\n\n150\n00:07:22.349 --> 00:07:23.518\nan asymmetric system.\n\n151\n00:07:23.518 --> 00:07:26.857\nSo, we may not know one of the two keys,\nwe may know one of the two keys.\n\n152\n00:07:26.857 --> 00:07:31.518\nAnd, we may or may not have cypher text,\nwhich is the outcome of that process.\n\n153\n00:07:31.518 --> 00:07:35.751\nSo there are many different things\nthat we may either need to find,\n\n154\n00:07:35.751 --> 00:07:40.610\nmay already have knowledge of, or\nmay need to somehow figure out.\n\n155\n00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:46.072\nWhat we're gonna talk about is how do we\nput things into those boxes, or baskets.\n\n156\n00:07:46.072 --> 00:07:50.450\nHow do we put things into baskets\nthat allow us, as attackers,\n\n157\n00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:55.257\nto start to populate enough items\nthat we can make educated guesses.\n\n158\n00:07:55.257 --> 00:08:00.657\nBecause ultimately what cryptanalysis\nis about Is filling in as many of those\n\n159\n00:08:00.657 --> 00:08:06.389\nblanks, and then deriving, either\nthrough aggregation, through inference,\n\n160\n00:08:06.389 --> 00:08:11.900\nthrough combination, and, or\neducated guesses, the ideas that we see.\n\n161\n00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.600\nAnd seeing if we can arrange them in\nsuch a way that we can derive the key.\n\n162\n00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.250\nThe trick always is find the private key.\n\n163\n00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:21.950\nUnlock the system, so we can run it\nforwards and backwards, encrypt and\n\n164\n00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:25.840\ndecrypt essentially on\ndemand with that key.\n\n165\n00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.690\nAnd remember,\nwhen we get the private key, right,\n\n166\n00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:32.070\nthis is the really important thing\nabout this entire thought process.\n\n167\n00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:34.410\nIt's not just, okay, I declare victory,\n\n168\n00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:38.240\nI declare that I was able to\ndecrypt this one message, right?\n\n169\n00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.955\nWe may have plain text as we've said.\n\n170\n00:08:40.955 --> 00:08:45.385\nWe may see the plain text of several\nmessages along with the corresponding\n\n171\n00:08:45.385 --> 00:08:46.250\ncypher text.\n\n172\n00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:48.220\nThis is the chosen plain text attack.\n\n173\n00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.890\nAnd we'll describe this in\nmore detail in just a moment.\n\n174\n00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:54.860\nBut we don't see all messages that\nhave been through the system, right?\n\n175\n00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.160\nThis is the thing.\n\n176\n00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.902\nAnd if we get the private key,\nwe can un-encrypt,\n\n177\n00:08:59.902 --> 00:09:05.122\nwe can decrypt any message that has\never been sent, that is being sent,\n\n178\n00:09:05.122 --> 00:09:09.231\nthat ever will be sent with\nthis particular set of keys.\n\n179\n00:09:09.231 --> 00:09:11.930\nThis public private key pair,\nor if it's symmetric,\n\n180\n00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:15.730\nthis individual private key,\nuntil that key is no longer used.\n\n181\n00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:18.293\nAnd so if we can get the private key,\n\n182\n00:09:18.293 --> 00:09:23.910\nwe have access to everything that is\nin the system, not just one message.\n\n183\n00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:25.540\nWe often talk about this\nfrom the perspective,\n\n184\n00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:27.970\nwe're gonna break a single message,\nand we're done, right?\n\n185\n00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:28.960\nYou see that in the movies.\n\n186\n00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.450\nWe decrypted this one message.\n\n187\n00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.260\nWe know the outcome, right,\nand we're successful.\n\n188\n00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:34.750\nYeah, but it's not just about that.\n\n189\n00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:37.060\nIt's about reading all traffic.\n\n190\n00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:40.651\nWe just often make it appear as\nif it's about a single instance.\n\n191\n00:09:40.651 --> 00:09:42.010\nIt's not about a single instance.\n\n192\n00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:45.360\nIn many cases, I actually have\nplain text that I can read.\n\n193\n00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.240\nIt's about understanding how to\nmanipulate the system without\n\n194\n00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:52.920\nthe knowledge of the owner, so I could\ncontinue to read that data over time.\n\n195\n00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.620\nThat's really what the goal\nof cryptanalysis is.\n\n196\n00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.350\nSo, just wanna be thinking\nabout that as we get started,\n\n197\n00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:00.210\nlay down that thought process.\n\n198\n00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:02.610\nPerhaps add a chocolate bar to the mix for\ngood measure.\n\n199\n00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:03.880\nWe'll see how that goes.\n\n200\n00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.580\nChocolate banana walnut bread,\nalways good too, like that.\n\n201\n00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:10.420\nSo, appreciate whoever threw\nthat in the chat there for us.\n\n202\n00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:14.380\nBut what we're gonna do is\nfocus on some of these attacks.\n\n203\n00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:17.675\nWe've defined the concept\nof cryptanalysis for you.\n\n204\n00:10:17.675 --> 00:10:20.740\nWe've talked about some of the tools and\ntechniques that go into this.\n\n205\n00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.088\nWe've talked about on prior\nepisodes frequency analysis.\n\n206\n00:10:23.088 --> 00:10:27.511\nWe actually had some stuff to say about\nthat when we were talking about hashing\n\n207\n00:10:27.511 --> 00:10:31.746\nand talking about cracking of various\napproaches or thought processes.\n\n208\n00:10:31.746 --> 00:10:36.064\nAnd the prevalence of certain letters and\ncertain words in whatever language we're\n\n209\n00:10:36.064 --> 00:10:39.591\ntalking about, and every language\nhas frequency analysis tables,\n\n210\n00:10:39.591 --> 00:10:42.235\nmost of them anyway,\nthat have been done for them.\n\n211\n00:10:42.235 --> 00:10:45.238\nYou can go out and\nGoogle frequency analysis for English,\n\n212\n00:10:45.238 --> 00:10:49.405\nfrequency analysis for French, and\nyou'll find there are academic studies and\n\n213\n00:10:49.405 --> 00:10:52.605\ntables that have actually been\ncreated around these things.\n\n214\n00:10:52.605 --> 00:10:54.697\nAnd if you do this kind of work for\na living,\n\n215\n00:10:54.697 --> 00:10:57.154\nthis is some of the stuff\nthat you spend time with.\n\n216\n00:10:57.154 --> 00:11:02.354\nBecause you start to understand that\nfrequency analysis is at the heart of many\n\n217\n00:11:02.354 --> 00:11:07.869\nof the approaches we try to use to reverse\nengineer this encryption solution, when\n\n218\n00:11:07.869 --> 00:11:13.360\nwe start to use the tools to chip away at\nit or to guess what the outcome may be.\n\n219\n00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.461\nSo we would look for\nin either the encrypted cypher text or\n\n220\n00:11:16.461 --> 00:11:19.885\nthe hash string or whatever it may be,\nthat we're targeting,\n\n221\n00:11:19.885 --> 00:11:24.485\nwe will look at the prevalence of certain\nrepetitions, right, certain patterns.\n\n222\n00:11:24.485 --> 00:11:28.822\nSo we've talked about the fact from the\nvery beginning of our conversations from\n\n223\n00:11:28.822 --> 00:11:32.428\nthis entire show, all the episodes,\nalmost without exception.\n\n224\n00:11:32.428 --> 00:11:36.950\nAnd every one of them somewhere, Cherokee\nor I've mentioned that a pattern of any\n\n225\n00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:42.580\nkind is gonna lead to not only disruption\nin the system if somebody finds it.\n\n226\n00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:46.280\nBut can lead to the system failing because\nthe bad actor may pick up on that.\n\n227\n00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.901\nAnd if they're good and they are smart\nenough to understand the pattern,\n\n228\n00:11:49.901 --> 00:11:54.100\nsee it for what it is and use it, they\nmay be able to decrypt what's going on or\n\n229\n00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.150\nunderstand how to use\nthat to their advantage.\n\n230\n00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:59.630\nSo frequency analysis is one of\nthe most important tools we have,\n\n231\n00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:02.080\nunderstanding that whole thought process,\nright?\n\n232\n00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.328\nWe've also talked about,\nalthough we didn't name it formally,\n\n233\n00:12:05.328 --> 00:12:07.947\nwe talked about derivatives\nof frequency analysis.\n\n234\n00:12:07.947 --> 00:12:11.214\nWe generically say frequency analysis,\nthat's what we do.\n\n235\n00:12:11.214 --> 00:12:14.686\nBut there actually are specific\nmethodologies that employ frequency\n\n236\n00:12:14.686 --> 00:12:15.600\nanalysis.\n\n237\n00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.110\nOne of them is called the Kasiski Test.\n\n238\n00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:18.653\n&gt;&gt; What?\n&gt;&gt; Try to say that three\n\n239\n00:12:18.653 --> 00:12:19.183\ntimes fast, right?\n\n240\n00:12:19.183 --> 00:12:21.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm not saying it again,\n\n241\n00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:22.467\nyou should have paid\nattention the first time.\n\n242\n00:12:22.467 --> 00:12:23.293\n&gt;&gt; Kasiski.\n\n243\n00:12:23.293 --> 00:12:27.660\n&gt;&gt; Kasiski, right, K-A-S-I-S-K-I, Kasiski.\n\n244\n00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:28.650\nIt's the Kasiski Test,\n\n245\n00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:32.540\nKasiski Method, there's different\nnames you hear it referred to by.\n\n246\n00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:36.200\nIt's named for the gentleman who actually\ndiscovered, or came up with this approach,\n\n247\n00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.030\nthis idea.\n\n248\n00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:39.500\nIt's a variation of frequency analysis.\n\n249\n00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:43.880\nAnd the idea is we use it to attack\npolyalphabetic substitution cyphers.\n\n250\n00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.930\nThink of vignette cypher here, right?\n\n251\n00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:47.660\nSo think about a cypher like that.\n\n252\n00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:52.760\nAnd we would use it to understand how to\nfind the repetitions, the patterns, and\n\n253\n00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:57.635\nthen to analyze them, and then try to\nwork backwards to use methodologies and\n\n254\n00:12:57.635 --> 00:13:00.943\ntechniques to then break\nthe patterns we find down.\n\n255\n00:13:00.943 --> 00:13:04.944\nSo we can actually understand what the\nplain text and ultimately how it relates\n\n256\n00:13:04.944 --> 00:13:08.350\nto the cypher text would be in decrypt,\nas a result, find the key.\n\n257\n00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:10.550\nRemember, the goal is\nalways to find the key.\n\n258\n00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:12.510\nSo keep in mind that\nthere are derivatives.\n\n259\n00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:16.050\nThere are different styles,\ndifferent approaches that we may find.\n\n260\n00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:19.010\nIf you go out and\nyou Google frequency analysis,\n\n261\n00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:21.790\nyou'll find a lot of different\ninformation about it, but\n\n262\n00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:25.650\nwhat you have to do is narrow\nyour search a little bit, right?\n\n263\n00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:27.850\nBecause it's not just frequency analysis.\n\n264\n00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:32.740\nIt's frequency analysis with\ncryptography or with cryptanalysis or\n\n265\n00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:35.670\ndifferent approaches you would use\nto find out about these methods.\n\n266\n00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:40.156\nBecause frequency analysis itself, as I\nsaid, is not just a cryptographic tool or\n\n267\n00:13:40.156 --> 00:13:40.868\ntechnique.\n\n268\n00:13:40.868 --> 00:13:44.016\nIt's used for many other things,\nwe use it in medicine,\n\n269\n00:13:44.016 --> 00:13:47.099\nwe use it in all sorts of places\nto do a variety of things,\n\n270\n00:13:47.099 --> 00:13:50.660\nincluding predicting what may\noccur as a result of inputs.\n\n271\n00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:54.560\nAnd so it's a common approach and\nit's not just used by us, but\n\n272\n00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.400\nit's adopted by us because it works very\nwell for what we're looking to do, right?\n\n273\n00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.363\nSo think about that.\n\n274\n00:13:59.363 --> 00:14:02.065\nIf you're in the habit of going\nto the track and gambling,\n\n275\n00:14:02.065 --> 00:14:03.399\nit's also very good there.\n\n276\n00:14:03.399 --> 00:14:05.484\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you pick up on that particular\n\n277\n00:14:05.484 --> 00:14:09.580\nthought process, you can imagine what it\nmay be used for in those scenarios, right?\n\n278\n00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:12.664\nRemember, card counting is\nillegal in those places, okay?\n\n279\n00:14:12.664 --> 00:14:16.110\nAll right, so having said that, what are\nsome of these attacks I keep referring to?\n\n280\n00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:19.251\nI mentioned shows and\nplain text attack already,\n\n281\n00:14:19.251 --> 00:14:24.336\nwe'll talk about that cypher text only,\nrelated key, linear cryptanalysis,\n\n282\n00:14:24.336 --> 00:14:28.093\ndifferential cryptanalysis,\nintegral cryptanalysis.\n\n283\n00:14:28.093 --> 00:14:30.652\nStop me when you hear something\nyou like cryptanalysis,\n\n284\n00:14:30.652 --> 00:14:32.750\nany and all of these approaches, right?\n\n285\n00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:36.949\nThese are named attacks,\nthese are actual categories or types or\n\n286\n00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:41.909\ndescriptions of specific attacks that we,\nas cryptanalysts, will use, or\n\n287\n00:14:41.909 --> 00:14:45.980\npeople that are attempting to\nanalyze cryptography will use.\n\n288\n00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.276\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And remember, right,\n\n289\n00:14:48.276 --> 00:14:52.140\nto be successful as somebody who\nis going to defend against these,\n\n290\n00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:56.694\nyou have to think and put yourself in the\nmindset of the person who is attempting\n\n291\n00:14:56.694 --> 00:14:59.880\nto use the attacks to break\nyour protections, right?\n\n292\n00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.370\nSo you have to think like the bad actor.\n\n293\n00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:05.185\nYou have to become, right,\nthe bad actor in your mind,\n\n294\n00:15:05.185 --> 00:15:08.700\nyou have to be thinking how\nwould I attack this system.\n\n295\n00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:13.710\nAre there weaknesses that, with this\napproach, I could use against this system?\n\n296\n00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:17.648\nSometimes it's hard for security\nprofessionals to do this because we have\n\n297\n00:15:17.648 --> 00:15:20.220\nhubris, we think well, I'm perfect, right?\n\n298\n00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:24.750\nHow can I have designed a system or\nput something in place that is weak?\n\n299\n00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:25.540\nHow could I, in other words,\n\n300\n00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.690\nhave made a mistake,\nis generically what I'm suggesting.\n\n301\n00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:30.400\nAnd the idea, thank you,\nthat's good, wave again.\n\n302\n00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.208\nThank you very much,\nI like it when you wave.\n\n303\n00:15:32.208 --> 00:15:33.196\n&gt;&gt; Did it go in your shot?\n\n304\n00:15:33.196 --> 00:15:35.160\n&gt;&gt; No, no, you didn't go in the shot.\n\n305\n00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.530\nYou did one of these.\n\n306\n00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:38.820\nAnd I was just acknowledging\nthe fact you waved, that's all.\n\n307\n00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.930\nI'm just playing with Cherokee,\nshe wants to ask a question.\n\n308\n00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:43.169\nWe're gonna let her do\nthat in just one second.\n\n309\n00:15:43.169 --> 00:15:48.135\nBut what I was just suggesting is,\nyou have to be that security professional\n\n310\n00:15:48.135 --> 00:15:51.008\nthat is willing to admit and\nacknowledge and\n\n311\n00:15:51.008 --> 00:15:55.529\nembrace the fact That you're not\ngonna be able to stop every attack.\n\n312\n00:15:55.529 --> 00:15:56.934\nYou're not gonna be perfect.\n\n313\n00:15:56.934 --> 00:16:00.525\nYou don't have the knowledge,\nthe skills, the capabilities,\n\n314\n00:16:00.525 --> 00:16:04.710\nthe tools to understand every attack\nthat may be launched against you.\n\n315\n00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:07.500\nBecause you're not gonna\nanticipate everything.\n\n316\n00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:10.655\nAnd there's absolutely nothing\nwrong with that by the way.\n\n317\n00:16:10.655 --> 00:16:15.385\nI love talking to students,\nI love talking to customers about the fact\n\n318\n00:16:15.385 --> 00:16:19.804\nthat we're gonna do our best to\ntry to defend against attackers.\n\n319\n00:16:19.804 --> 00:16:24.448\nBut there's always the unknown element,\nthe unknown risk, the unqualified,\n\n320\n00:16:24.448 --> 00:16:27.780\nunquantified, uncategorized opportunity.\n\n321\n00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:32.247\nThe vulnerability, the weakness that the\nattacker has figured out that we may or\n\n322\n00:16:32.247 --> 00:16:36.986\nmay not have defended against or have even\nunderstood was a reality, a possibility.\n\n323\n00:16:36.986 --> 00:16:41.239\nAs a security professional if you\nunderstand that you have to always\n\n324\n00:16:41.239 --> 00:16:45.731\nanticipate that there's something\nthat you' re not accounting for.\n\n325\n00:16:45.731 --> 00:16:49.224\nTo the best of your abilities,\nthink through the logic of that.\n\n326\n00:16:49.224 --> 00:16:50.805\nThat doesn't mean you could plan for\n\n327\n00:16:50.805 --> 00:16:53.869\neverything it simply means that you\nshould be as prepared as you can be.\n\n328\n00:16:53.869 --> 00:16:58.043\nAnd understand that when something\nbad happens it may be happening for\n\n329\n00:16:58.043 --> 00:17:00.870\nreasons totally beyond your control.\n\n330\n00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:04.290\nDon't go crazy and\ngo looking for every answer.\n\n331\n00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:07.480\nGo and try to figure out\nhow to stop the attack and\n\n332\n00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.400\nthen work backwards after the fact.\n\n333\n00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.400\nLearn from that experience.\n\n334\n00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.150\nBecome better the next time.\n\n335\n00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:15.430\nAnd then stop that attack from recurring.\n\n336\n00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:17.520\nThat's the ultimate\noutcome that we look for.\n\n337\n00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.960\nWe're not gonna stop everything\nas security professionals.\n\n338\n00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.190\nPeople who tell you\ndifferently are lying to you,\n\n339\n00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:23.820\nthey're just not telling you the truth.\n\n340\n00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:24.630\nNobody's that good.\n\n341\n00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:27.680\nI don't care who they are,\nI don't care what they do for a living.\n\n342\n00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:31.590\nYou just can't be, because there's unknown\nquantities that operate in these systems\n\n343\n00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:33.180\nthat we have no knowledge of.\n\n344\n00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:36.170\nSomebody figures it out, but we may not\nhave been the one that figured it out,\n\n345\n00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:37.300\nso we don't know.\n\n346\n00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:40.580\nSo, Miss Cherokee, you wanted to throw\nyour hat in the ring here, proverbially.\n\n347\n00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.140\nI would say literally, but\nyou're not wearing a hat.\n\n348\n00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.926\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I really don't have too\nmuch to the add to the conversation,\n\n349\n00:17:44.926 --> 00:17:48.210\nother than I really like the fact that\nyou were talking about having that bias,\n\n350\n00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:49.889\nor that kind of egotistical approach.\n\n351\n00:17:49.889 --> 00:17:52.970\nThinking, I created this system,\nit must be great.\n\n352\n00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:56.201\nThey might not be able to see those\nvulnerabilities or weaknesses.\n\n353\n00:17:56.201 --> 00:18:00.070\nSo that would be the value of having a\nthird party penetration tester come in, or\n\n354\n00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:02.620\nsome kind of unbiased perspective.\n\n355\n00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:06.970\n&gt;&gt; It would be one of the things,\npen testing, vulnerability assessments,\n\n356\n00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:09.730\naudits, there's all these things\nthat fall into this category.\n\n357\n00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:13.520\nAnd every one of them brings a very\nspecific unique set of skills,\n\n358\n00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:19.350\nopportunities, and observations,\nas you're pointing out from third parties.\n\n359\n00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:21.470\nThey may or\nmay not have a vested interest.\n\n360\n00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:25.130\nThey may or may not be biased because\nwe will typically do both internal and\n\n361\n00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:26.550\nexternal versions of these.\n\n362\n00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:29.000\nSo if it's an internal pen test,\n\n363\n00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.310\nan internal vulnerability assessment\nbeing done by members of our team,\n\n364\n00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:39.100\nand, or a pre-audit where typically\nwe're preparing internally.\n\n365\n00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:43.930\nUsually under the guidance or\nwith the help of perhaps our internal IA,\n\n366\n00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:48.670\nour internal information assurance,\nour internal auditing teams and\n\n367\n00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:51.540\nperhaps with some guidance\nfrom an outside auditor.\n\n368\n00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.060\nThere may be a mixture of both?\n\n369\n00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:56.690\nBecause we do tend to hire third\nparties from outside certainly.\n\n370\n00:18:56.690 --> 00:19:00.700\nBut we also if we're smart do a lot of our\nown assessment work throughout the year.\n\n371\n00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:05.370\nSo that way we kind of ride on both\nsides of that divide looking for\n\n372\n00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:06.090\nthe opportunities,\n\n373\n00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:09.460\nas you were pointing out, to figure out\nabout the things we may have missed.\n\n374\n00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:12.060\nSo it definitely is\nimportant to bring that up.\n\n375\n00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.760\nBut it will be both, and\nI don't use the word bias,\n\n376\n00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:18.190\nonly cuz I think there's maybe a negative\nconnotation associated with that that\n\n377\n00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:19.860\npeople come up with in their mind.\n\n378\n00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:20.740\nI don't view it that way.\n\n379\n00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:25.591\nBut if you say biased, and some people\nthink, that's a negative, I'm kind of in\n\n380\n00:19:25.591 --> 00:19:30.390\nfavor or not in favor of certain things,\nand I'm excluding things in my mind.\n\n381\n00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:35.430\nI prefer to think of it more as\nmerely the perspective we come from.\n\n382\n00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:38.167\nIf we work for the company,\nwe're going to potentially\n\n383\n00:19:38.167 --> 00:19:41.312\nhave a very different vantage point,\nas you were pointing out,\n\n384\n00:19:41.312 --> 00:19:44.475\na different context,\na different way of interpreting things.\n\n385\n00:19:44.475 --> 00:19:48.010\nBecause we have knowledge\nof what goes on inside.\n\n386\n00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:52.405\nThat an external actor, a higher\nthird party, an external pen testing\n\n387\n00:19:52.405 --> 00:19:57.609\norganization, an external vulnerability\nassessment service will perhaps have or\n\n388\n00:19:57.609 --> 00:20:02.322\nnot have depending on the nature of\nthe engagement, what we hire them to do.\n\n389\n00:20:02.322 --> 00:20:06.480\nIs it a white box, black box or\ngrey box test, blind, double blind,\n\n390\n00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.510\ndifferent terms we use for this?\n\n391\n00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:12.336\nBut ultimately if they're coming in and\nthe goal is hey,\n\n392\n00:20:12.336 --> 00:20:14.817\nattack us with everything you have.\n\n393\n00:20:14.817 --> 00:20:19.341\nAnd other than this IP subnet where we've\ngot critical mission systems that you\n\n394\n00:20:19.341 --> 00:20:24.000\ncannot touch, and this is often what we'll\ndo in these scenarios, we'll hire or\n\n395\n00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.180\ncontract with a third party.\n\n396\n00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:29.350\nBut it's gonna be a double-blind test\nwhere they don't know anything other than\n\n397\n00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:30.710\nvery minimal information.\n\n398\n00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:34.430\nThey know the company name and\nthey're given a time window, two weeks or\n\n399\n00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:35.900\nwhatever it will be.\n\n400\n00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:40.120\nWe sketch out some very basic\nstatement of work, kind of parameters.\n\n401\n00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:42.540\nHey you're not going to go into\nthese subnets like I said.\n\n402\n00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:45.870\nIf you see anything with this kind of\na name on it you ignore it because\n\n403\n00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.680\nyou can't take down those systems.\n\n404\n00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:51.315\nBut other than that that's essentially\nall the external actor knows.\n\n405\n00:20:51.315 --> 00:20:55.645\nAnd if it's a double blind test, we don't\ntell our internal teams they're coming.\n\n406\n00:20:55.645 --> 00:20:58.795\nSo, we have them show up and\njust do their normal stuff\n\n407\n00:20:58.795 --> 00:21:01.755\nbecause we wanna see how good\nour external defenses are.\n\n408\n00:21:01.755 --> 00:21:03.004\n&gt;&gt; How to react?\n&gt;&gt; We wanna see how good\n\n409\n00:21:03.004 --> 00:21:04.825\nour monitoring is internally.\n\n410\n00:21:04.825 --> 00:21:09.505\nIf it's a blind test, we typically\nwill not tell the external actors or\n\n411\n00:21:09.505 --> 00:21:10.255\nthe internal team.\n\n412\n00:21:10.255 --> 00:21:12.495\nIt's a question of which\nteam we want to focus on.\n\n413\n00:21:12.495 --> 00:21:14.750\nBut one team will have\nknowledge of the other team.\n\n414\n00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:15.940\nBut both teams don't.\n\n415\n00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:19.130\nAnd so there's a lot of ways to do this,\nbut ultimately it's about the amount of\n\n416\n00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:22.960\ninformation that you are able to garner,\nand how you put that to use.\n\n417\n00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:27.780\nAnd the bias is, or the perspectives,\nthe context that we have is,\n\n418\n00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.290\nwhat we're really trying to test.\n\n419\n00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:31.950\nHow good are our defenses,\nas you were just saying?\n\n420\n00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:33.570\nAnd how good are we at planning?\n\n421\n00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:34.950\nAnd what's the outcome of that?\n\n422\n00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:38.350\nAnd we've gotta be realistic,\nand be willing to admit, and\n\n423\n00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:41.640\nbe told firsthand that maybe\nwe're not as good as we are.\n\n424\n00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.590\nBecause maybe there\nare things we're missing.\n\n425\n00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:47.410\nMaybe under normal circumstances\nthat thought process works.\n\n426\n00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:50.084\nBut maybe in this scenario,\nas crazy as it is,\n\n427\n00:21:50.084 --> 00:21:52.701\nmaybe under that scenario it doesn't work.\n\n428\n00:21:52.701 --> 00:21:55.596\nAnd we haven't thought through\nwhat that scenario looks like, or\n\n429\n00:21:55.596 --> 00:21:59.070\nperhaps put countermeasures and controls\nin place to mitigate that scenario.\n\n430\n00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:03.150\nCuz it's so unlikely, we just haven't\nthought about it being used against us.\n\n431\n00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:07.910\nBut, the thing I tell my customers all\nthe time about highly unlikely scenarios\n\n432\n00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:11.250\nis they do happen,\nthey just don't happen very often.\n\n433\n00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:13.840\nOnce in a 100 year events do occur.\n\n434\n00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.160\nThey just occur once in\na 100 years on average.\n\n435\n00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:20.140\nYou don't wanna be the person, the entity,\nthe group, that forgot to plan for\n\n436\n00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:21.770\nthat once in a 100 year event.\n\n437\n00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:24.410\nAnd then be the recipient of\nthat once in a 100 year event\n\n438\n00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:25.910\nis what I tell my customers.\n\n439\n00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:29.600\nIt may be too expensive,\nmay be too time consuming.\n\n440\n00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:33.210\nIt may be too unrealistic and\nwe have to talk then about risk and\n\n441\n00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:34.740\nacceptance of risk.\n\n442\n00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:35.720\nAnd governance risk and\n\n443\n00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:39.190\ncompliance is the back end of\nevery one of these conversations.\n\n444\n00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:43.450\nBut my customers have to write that\ndown on a piece of paper certified and\n\n445\n00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:47.970\nsigned it that they're willing to accept\nthat risk if they're not gonna address it.\n\n446\n00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:51.980\nAnd as a result, they've chosen to\ndeal with that risk on a certain way.\n\n447\n00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:54.148\nBut we have to audit for that,\nand we have to document that.\n\n448\n00:22:54.148 --> 00:22:57.770\nAnd we have to validate the customers\nto understand that risk.\n\n449\n00:22:57.770 --> 00:22:59.990\nThat's our job as security professionals.\n\n450\n00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:02.480\nIf we let that though\nprocess go unchallenged,\n\n451\n00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.210\nthen we're not doing our jobs.\n\n452\n00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:06.289\nAnd so we do have to admit\nthat we're not perfect.\n\n453\n00:23:06.289 --> 00:23:09.360\nWe do have to admit there\nare things we may not be aware of.\n\n454\n00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:11.610\nWe do have to admit that we're willing and\n\n455\n00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:15.380\nopen to the feedback from external third\nparties that may help us to be better.\n\n456\n00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:17.870\nOtherwise, we just can't\ndo our job effectively.\n\n457\n00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:19.590\nYou could be good at a lot of things, but\n\n458\n00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:21.390\nyou can't be good at everything,\nis the problem.\n\n459\n00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:24.870\nThe idea of the Renaissance\nperson is important, and\n\n460\n00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:26.880\nyou wanna strive to be\nas good as you can be.\n\n461\n00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:31.080\nBut, in this game, things change so\nquickly that it's very difficult for\n\n462\n00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:32.380\nyou to master everything.\n\n463\n00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:35.300\nAnd it's a very important\nthought process to start from.\n\n464\n00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:39.435\nBecause if we do that,\nquick movie reference here.\n\n465\n00:23:39.435 --> 00:23:42.129\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee's cringing, she's like,\n\n466\n00:23:42.129 --> 00:23:45.780\nGod I was hoping I was gonna get through\nthis without another movie reference.\n\n467\n00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:47.827\nAre you an Indiana Jones fan?\n\n468\n00:23:47.827 --> 00:23:50.910\n&gt;&gt; I just remember monkey brains.\n\n469\n00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:52.105\nFrom my childhood.\n\n470\n00:23:52.105 --> 00:23:53.774\nAnd I think that's all I\ntook away from that [LAUGH].\n\n471\n00:23:53.774 --> 00:23:56.100\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so the short answer would be, no.\n\n472\n00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:56.910\n&gt;&gt; Correct [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n473\n00:23:56.910 --> 00:24:01.070\nall right, so yes,\nmonkey brains was one of the references.\n\n474\n00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:03.238\nBut I was thinking about [LAUGH].\n\n475\n00:24:03.238 --> 00:24:05.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Monkey brains [LAUGH].\n\n476\n00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.240\nI was thinking about Indiana Jones,\n\n477\n00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:10.430\nthe movie where they're\ngoing after the Holy Grail.\n\n478\n00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:15.012\nAnd in that particular movie,\nas they're moving into the end result\n\n479\n00:24:15.012 --> 00:24:19.831\nwhere they're gonna find the grail,\nand the Indiana Jones character,\n\n480\n00:24:19.831 --> 00:24:24.334\nHarrison Ford, has to go through\nall the different kind of tests and\n\n481\n00:24:24.334 --> 00:24:29.627\nthe different security measures that were\nmeant to keep them out of the temple,\n\n482\n00:24:29.627 --> 00:24:33.583\nPetra, where they are trying to find,\nright, the grail.\n\n483\n00:24:33.583 --> 00:24:36.708\nAnd one of them is,\nhe has to go through the whole.\n\n484\n00:24:36.708 --> 00:24:40.211\nHe got's got the floor laid out with all\nthe different stones that spell out God's\n\n485\n00:24:40.211 --> 00:24:41.920\nname and all this kinda stuff.\n\n486\n00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:45.898\nAnd he says, at one point,\nthat man has to bow before God.\n\n487\n00:24:45.898 --> 00:24:48.587\nAnd he's gotta know that has to,\nthe translation of that code is,\n\n488\n00:24:48.587 --> 00:24:49.595\nhe's gotta bend down and\n\n489\n00:24:49.595 --> 00:24:52.443\ndo this whole somersault thing to\nget through all the security stuff.\n\n490\n00:24:52.443 --> 00:24:54.184\n&gt;&gt; So he doesn't get his head\nchopped off or something like that?\n\n491\n00:24:54.184 --> 00:24:54.852\n&gt;&gt; Right so, with the spinning.\n\n492\n00:24:54.852 --> 00:24:55.443\n&gt;&gt; Okay [LAUGH].\n\n493\n00:24:55.443 --> 00:24:58.647\n&gt;&gt; It's monkey brains, right, so\nyou got more than that out of it, right.\n\n494\n00:24:58.647 --> 00:25:02.220\nSo, yeah,\nhe has to essentially be humble, right.\n\n495\n00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:05.210\nHe has to humble himself.\n\n496\n00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:06.410\nAnd the act of humbling himself,\n\n497\n00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:10.535\nby lowering himself, allows him to\nget through that particular maze.\n\n498\n00:25:10.535 --> 00:25:12.390\nAnd it's the same idea here.\n\n499\n00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:14.180\nYou've gotta bring humility and\n\n500\n00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:17.740\nyou've gotta be humble as a security\nprofessional to be able to do your job.\n\n501\n00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:21.610\nWhen I talk to people that just feel\nthat they know everything, they have all\n\n502\n00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:25.420\nthe answers, I know I'm gonna have a lot\nof work when I talk to those customers\n\n503\n00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:28.700\nbecause they're gonna convince\nthemselves that everything's great.\n\n504\n00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:31.000\nAnd I'm just gonna be waiting there\nto pick up the pieces, right.\n\n505\n00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.685\nI love those kind of engagements.\n\n506\n00:25:32.685 --> 00:25:36.955\nI don't love the fact that those customers\ndon't understand the risks that they face.\n\n507\n00:25:36.955 --> 00:25:40.972\nBut I love the fact that they believe\neverything will always be good because\n\n508\n00:25:40.972 --> 00:25:43.725\nit's just all bright,\nshiny, purple unicorns.\n\n509\n00:25:43.725 --> 00:25:46.615\nBut then they see the reality of\nthe world and it's purple squirrels, and\n\n510\n00:25:46.615 --> 00:25:48.270\nthey're just sadly disappointed.\n\n511\n00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:50.545\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so chosen-plaintext attack.\n\n512\n00:25:50.545 --> 00:25:52.067\nLet's talk about some of\nthese kinds of attacks.\n\n513\n00:25:52.067 --> 00:25:56.124\nSo the chosen-plaintext attack\nis gonna be the attack,\n\n514\n00:25:56.124 --> 00:26:00.012\nas I indicated,\nwhere we have both the ciphertext, so\n\n515\n00:26:00.012 --> 00:26:04.086\nthe enciphered text that\ncorresponds to the plaintext.\n\n516\n00:26:04.086 --> 00:26:05.357\nAnd we have both of these.\n\n517\n00:26:05.357 --> 00:26:07.117\nWe can choose the plaintext.\n\n518\n00:26:07.117 --> 00:26:09.897\nWe can therefore get the outcome,\nthe ciphertext.\n\n519\n00:26:09.897 --> 00:26:11.237\nAnd by working backwards and\n\n520\n00:26:11.237 --> 00:26:15.167\nforwards in the system, we can begin\nto do frequency analysis fine patterns.\n\n521\n00:26:15.167 --> 00:26:19.502\nAnd, as I said, this is often what\nis done to try to derive the key.\n\n522\n00:26:19.502 --> 00:26:24.330\nSo chosen-plaintext attacks allow\nus to manipulate a cryptosystem,\n\n523\n00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:28.570\ngenerating plaintext that\nwe choose as input, and\n\n524\n00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:32.840\nthen getting the outcome, the ciphertext,\nto begin to see how things are enciphered.\n\n525\n00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.970\nSo there's a famous story,\nseveral famous stories.\n\n526\n00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:40.178\nBut one of them from the second World War,\nwhere in occupied Europe at the time,\n\n527\n00:26:40.178 --> 00:26:44.376\nyou had many resistance cells,\nthe French and the British, and\n\n528\n00:26:44.376 --> 00:26:48.966\nall of these different entities that\nwere operating in Nazi Germany,\n\n529\n00:26:48.966 --> 00:26:53.899\nNazi Europe rather, I should say,\nwhen the occupation was taking place.\n\n530\n00:26:53.899 --> 00:26:56.353\nAnd you had all these underground\ncells that had spies and\n\n531\n00:26:56.353 --> 00:26:58.205\nwere keeping an eye on what was happening.\n\n532\n00:26:58.205 --> 00:27:03.072\nOne of the ways in which the information\nthat came back from the resistance from\n\n533\n00:27:03.072 --> 00:27:06.980\nthe underground was being used\nwas the allies would say, hey,\n\n534\n00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:11.710\nwe need to find out about this military\ntroop train, or whatever it was.\n\n535\n00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:14.920\nWe need you to, whatever\nthe underground cell would have been,\n\n536\n00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:19.010\nto manipulate information\nbetween this army post,\n\n537\n00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:21.860\nlet's say, and headquarters as they\nwere transmitting over the radio.\n\n538\n00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:24.830\nWe need you to get them to send\ncertain kinds of messages so\n\n539\n00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:27.960\nwe can see what the code is,\nright, and understand the key.\n\n540\n00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:32.500\nAnd so there was a famous story where\none of these resistance cells was\n\n541\n00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:36.730\noperating near where they had a major,\na huge train depot,\n\n542\n00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:40.190\na big switching station for\nall the trains, a big train yard.\n\n543\n00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:42.080\nAnd they would go in at night and\n\n544\n00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:45.220\nthey would shoot out the light\nbulb on the platform.\n\n545\n00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:47.800\nAnd they would then force\nthe Germans in the morning.\n\n546\n00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:48.930\n&gt;&gt; To request supplies?\n\n547\n00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:51.380\n&gt;&gt; To request, essentially,\na new light bulb and\n\n548\n00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:54.870\nput in a report that said light\nbulb broken or shot out at night.\n\n549\n00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:58.860\nAnd so they were choosing the plaintext,\nand they were manipulating what that would\n\n550\n00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:03.270\nbecome because they were seeing the radio\ntransmissions getting the enciphered text.\n\n551\n00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:04.990\nAnd then they could,\nover a series of days,\n\n552\n00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:08.610\nstart to zero in on what the keys were\nthat were being used and rotated.\n\n553\n00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:10.955\nSo just one of those\nstories that comes out, but\n\n554\n00:28:10.955 --> 00:28:13.690\nis interesting when you start to\nsee how this is actually applied.\n\n555\n00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:15.065\nSo chosen-plaintext attacks.\n\n556\n00:28:15.065 --> 00:28:18.180\nCiphertext-only attacks,\nas the name implies,\n\n557\n00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:21.010\nyou probably think,\nwe only have the ciphertext, right,\n\n558\n00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:24.550\nwhich is a very common starting point for\nmost of these attacks.\n\n559\n00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:26.041\nWe can run sniffers.\n\n560\n00:28:26.041 --> 00:28:27.944\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You mentioned Ethereal or\n\n561\n00:28:27.944 --> 00:28:29.995\nWireshark in a few of our episodes.\n\n562\n00:28:29.995 --> 00:28:33.880\nNetwork Chemistry, Packetizer,\na tool I often use and I talk about,\n\n563\n00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:37.265\nsimilar tool to what we were just\ntalking about with Ethereal, Wireshark.\n\n564\n00:28:37.265 --> 00:28:41.120\nThere's EtherApe,\nthere is the Microsoft Network Monitor,\n\n565\n00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.590\nthere's all these different\ntools that you can use.\n\n566\n00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:46.020\nWhatever you like, but\nyou're getting the encrypted bits,\n\n567\n00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:48.250\nthe stream and the flow of information.\n\n568\n00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:51.500\nWhen we have that, and\nall we have is that,\n\n569\n00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:54.930\nit's probably the toughest of the attacks,\nright, cuz all we have is the ciphertext.\n\n570\n00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:56.950\nBut it is a category of attacks.\n\n571\n00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:59.560\nWe may start to work backwards\non the ciphertext and\n\n572\n00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:01.390\nsee if we can find patterns.\n\n573\n00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:03.948\nBut it's a lot harder without\nthe plaintext to match it to.\n\n574\n00:29:03.948 --> 00:29:08.370\nSo clearly ciphertext-only attacks,\nmuch more difficult than chosen-plaintext\n\n575\n00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:12.490\nattacks, at least from\nthe perspective of how we operate,\n\n576\n00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:15.730\nhow we actually may gain advantage,\nand how long it may take us.\n\n577\n00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:18.090\nWe have what are called\nrelated-key attacks.\n\n578\n00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:21.034\nRelated-key attacks are similar to\nchosen-plaintext attacks, right.\n\n579\n00:29:21.034 --> 00:29:22.261\nThey're gonna be very similar.\n\n580\n00:29:22.261 --> 00:29:27.325\nBut the idea is that where a\nchosen-plaintext attack implies plaintext\n\n581\n00:29:27.325 --> 00:29:32.979\nand ciphertext from a single cryptosystem,\nusing a single set of keys, right.\n\n582\n00:29:32.979 --> 00:29:37.890\nSo, in theory, one private key or one\npublic, private key pair is being used.\n\n583\n00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:40.160\nWhat the related-key attack implies,\n\n584\n00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:45.150\nit's essentially two chosen-plaintext\nattacks executed in parallel.\n\n585\n00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:48.538\nBut you're getting the plaintext\nenciphered into ciphertext,\n\n586\n00:29:48.538 --> 00:29:52.551\nyou're getting those streams,\nusing two different, but related, keys.\n\n587\n00:29:52.551 --> 00:29:56.576\nSo we would have two streams of text,\nplaintext, ciphertext,\n\n588\n00:29:56.576 --> 00:29:59.782\nbeing encrypted using two\ndistinctly different,\n\n589\n00:29:59.782 --> 00:30:03.596\nbut mathematically or\ncryptographically related, keys.\n\n590\n00:30:03.596 --> 00:30:07.301\nA primary key that generates subkeys,\nright, are related,\n\n591\n00:30:07.301 --> 00:30:11.480\nthose keys have to be closely related for\nthese attacks to work.\n\n592\n00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:14.090\nNow, this category of\nattack is actually newer.\n\n593\n00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:18.285\nThis is not the kind of thing you would\nhave seen 70, 80 years ago, right,\n\n594\n00:30:18.285 --> 00:30:21.797\nwhen we just started to do some\nof this basic cryptanalysis work.\n\n595\n00:30:21.797 --> 00:30:25.519\nBut, rather, very recently,\nmaybe the last 15, 20 years,\n\n596\n00:30:25.519 --> 00:30:27.722\nwith wireless systems in particular.\n\n597\n00:30:27.722 --> 00:30:31.154\nAnd we talked a lot in one of our\nprior episodes, when we talked\n\n598\n00:30:31.154 --> 00:30:35.850\nabout the applications of cryptography,\nwe did a whole series of episodes on that.\n\n599\n00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:36.704\nRemember that was a lot of fun, right.\n\n600\n00:30:36.704 --> 00:30:38.453\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And we did all that, but\n\n601\n00:30:38.453 --> 00:30:42.722\nin one of those episodes we spoke about\nwireless encryption standards, right.\n\n602\n00:30:42.722 --> 00:30:45.368\nWe talked about different protocols\nthat could be used there.\n\n603\n00:30:45.368 --> 00:30:47.300\nSo we talked about WEP.\n\n604\n00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:50.070\nWe don't like WEP, right, that wasn't\nvery fun, but we talked about WEP.\n\n605\n00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:55.070\nWe did talk about, if you remember,\nWPA, WPA2, WPA2-Enterprise.\n\n606\n00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:59.537\nWe talked about the different mechanisms\nand methodologies employed there, and\n\n607\n00:30:59.537 --> 00:31:04.132\nhow these different protection techniques,\nas we kind of grew up through the uses of\n\n608\n00:31:04.132 --> 00:31:08.340\nwireless and understood more about how\nto protect wireless transmissions,\n\n609\n00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.428\nbecame more likely to be successful.\n\n610\n00:31:10.428 --> 00:31:14.906\nAnd how we use WPA2-Enterprise today\nbecause it is seen as being highly secure.\n\n611\n00:31:14.906 --> 00:31:17.440\nAt least right now,\nit's seen as being highly secure, right.\n\n612\n00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:22.040\nThe use of radio server, the\nimplementation of extended authentication\n\n613\n00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:25.640\nparameters, things like EAP, we talked\nabout that and why it's important.\n\n614\n00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:30.456\nThe use of AES as the primary underlying\nalgorithm to do the cryptography,\n\n615\n00:31:30.456 --> 00:31:31.838\nstrong encryption.\n\n616\n00:31:31.838 --> 00:31:36.377\nSo when we use wireless systems,\nwe are deriving keys from,\n\n617\n00:31:36.377 --> 00:31:38.426\ntypically, a master key.\n\n618\n00:31:38.426 --> 00:31:42.411\nAnd we're using those keys in routes,\nright, or we're using them iteratively.\n\n619\n00:31:42.411 --> 00:31:44.760\nBut then we're getting rid of them,\nwe're not repeating them.\n\n620\n00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:48.460\nIf the keys are going to be\nmathematically related to each other,\n\n621\n00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:50.760\na related key attack may actually work.\n\n622\n00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:54.290\nSo we tend to see this kind\nof attack taking place on\n\n623\n00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:57.210\ninformation that we gather through\nwireless sniffing, more often than not.\n\n624\n00:31:57.210 --> 00:31:59.280\nThat's where we tend to\nsee this being successful.\n\n625\n00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:02.528\nBecause the keys have to be\nessentially in hierarchy of some kind,\n\n626\n00:32:02.528 --> 00:32:06.356\nsome sort of chain where the primary key\ncan be or the secondary, tertiary keys\n\n627\n00:32:06.356 --> 00:32:09.727\nwe get can somehow be related back and\ntraced back up to a primary key.\n\n628\n00:32:09.727 --> 00:32:11.635\nSo its kind of a little twist on that,\n\n629\n00:32:11.635 --> 00:32:15.735\nbut it's essentially just two chosen\nplain text attacks that take place.\n\n630\n00:32:15.735 --> 00:32:18.535\nBut we get the information with two\nkeys that are very closely related.\n\n631\n00:32:18.535 --> 00:32:22.015\nWe have linear cryptanalysis,\nthe idea behind this, so\n\n632\n00:32:22.015 --> 00:32:25.660\nif you just think about the logic\nof the naming convention.\n\n633\n00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:29.779\nAnd I like the naming conventional use for\nthese attacks, because even if we're not\n\n634\n00:32:29.779 --> 00:32:33.781\nsure about what they are, the name itself\nkind of gives you a hint, kind of implies\n\n635\n00:32:33.781 --> 00:32:37.752\nwhat the attack may look like, what it may\nbe focused on, how we may carry it out.\n\n636\n00:32:37.752 --> 00:32:41.956\nShows in plain text, cipher text only,\nright related key, I mean those pretty\n\n637\n00:32:41.956 --> 00:32:46.070\nmuch give away, now that we've\nexplained them exactly what they are.\n\n638\n00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:47.910\nSo linear cryptanalysis.\n\n639\n00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:51.942\nThis is a known plain text attack, so\nwe've talked about cipher text only,\n\n640\n00:32:51.942 --> 00:32:54.084\nwe've talked about chosen plain text,\n\n641\n00:32:54.084 --> 00:32:58.137\na known plain text attack is just an\nattack that has access to the plain text.\n\n642\n00:32:58.137 --> 00:33:00.668\nBut what we're doing is we're going in and\n\n643\n00:33:00.668 --> 00:33:03.912\nwe're using what's called\na linear approximation.\n\n644\n00:33:03.912 --> 00:33:08.287\nWe are trying to operate on this\ninformation that is generated in\n\n645\n00:33:08.287 --> 00:33:11.284\nthe cipher text by taking\none bit at a time and\n\n646\n00:33:11.284 --> 00:33:16.440\ntrying to figure out through\nmanipulation whether or not we're close.\n\n647\n00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:19.219\nYou ever play Minesweeper?\n\n648\n00:33:19.219 --> 00:33:22.992\n&gt;&gt; You know I don't really\nunderstand fully how it works.\n\n649\n00:33:22.992 --> 00:33:24.960\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but you've seen it, right?\n\n650\n00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You have a sense of what it looks like.\n\n651\n00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:28.420\nAll right, so,\n&gt;&gt; I don't remember all the mathematics\n\n652\n00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:29.690\nbehind it, it was a long time ago.\n\n653\n00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:32.220\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right.\nBut you're familiar with the general idea?\n\n654\n00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:33.620\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; The concept which is, yeah,\n\n655\n00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:34.540\nyou have a grid, right?\n\n656\n00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:39.170\nClearly, and when you use the grid,\nthe grid is all covered,\n\n657\n00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:41.740\nit's all the squares, in other words,\nyou don't know what's underneath it.\n\n658\n00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:47.111\n&gt;&gt; And it's essentially a combination\nof concentration and, you know, luck.\n\n659\n00:33:47.111 --> 00:33:52.582\nBecause, if you remember, where obviously\nthe flags are or things that you find,\n\n660\n00:33:52.582 --> 00:33:56.218\nthen you could begin, right, to figure out\n&gt;&gt; Mapping out where those bombs are.\n\n661\n00:33:56.218 --> 00:33:58.250\n&gt;&gt; Mapping out essentially\nwhere the mines may be.\n\n662\n00:33:58.250 --> 00:33:59.473\nSo there is a methodology,\n\n663\n00:33:59.473 --> 00:34:02.940\nthere actually is a thought process that\nyou can use to try to figure this out.\n\n664\n00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:07.292\nBut the analogy here is that with\nMinesweeper, what you're trying to do is\n\n665\n00:34:07.292 --> 00:34:11.520\nfigure out what's around you, right,\nin theory, in all these areas.\n\n666\n00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:13.109\n&gt;&gt; Well they give you those numbers, and\nso the numbers, they mean something, yes.\n\n667\n00:34:13.109 --> 00:34:15.400\n&gt;&gt; Right, the one, the two,\nthe three, the four and five.\n\n668\n00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:17.823\nRight, so it means that you're\nwithin a certain number of squares.\n\n669\n00:34:17.823 --> 00:34:18.897\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right, in theory,\n\n670\n00:34:18.897 --> 00:34:20.480\nfrom where a mine may be.\n\n671\n00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:24.682\nAnd so if you pay attention to all the\nwarning signs, the math, all that stuff,\n\n672\n00:34:24.682 --> 00:34:27.405\nand you're not just one\nof those random clickers.\n\n673\n00:34:27.405 --> 00:34:30.760\nYou know, one, two, boop, and then you\nblew up, and you start over again.\n\n674\n00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:33.410\nBut if you actually try to\nunderstand the mathematics and\n\n675\n00:34:33.410 --> 00:34:38.230\nyou work it out,\nyou are using a very specific design.\n\n676\n00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:39.017\nA very specific approach.\n\n677\n00:34:39.017 --> 00:34:40.920\nAnd you're being methodical.\n\n678\n00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:43.560\nThis is similar to linear cryptanalysis,\nright?\n\n679\n00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:47.330\nBecause we're using that approach to\nunderstand where things are and trying to\n\n680\n00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:50.520\nunderstand, if we manipulate certain\nthings, what that outcome will look like.\n\n681\n00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:54.400\nSo when we think about linear\ncryptanalysis, we are trying to\n\n682\n00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:58.400\nunderstand and approximate the behavior of\nthe block cipher and trying to understand\n\n683\n00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:02.375\nhow slight changes remember confusion,\ndiffusion, avalanche effect.\n\n684\n00:35:02.375 --> 00:35:06.685\nHow slight changes may not lead\nto further encipherment, but\n\n685\n00:35:06.685 --> 00:35:08.065\nactually lead to decipherment.\n\n686\n00:35:08.065 --> 00:35:10.465\nBecause we're able to reverse engineer and\nwork backwards.\n\n687\n00:35:10.465 --> 00:35:12.241\nSo it's kind of an interesting attack.\n\n688\n00:35:12.241 --> 00:35:15.665\nGiven enough plain text pairs on\nthe corresponding cipher text,\n\n689\n00:35:15.665 --> 00:35:19.645\nwe actually may be able to derive bits\nof information about the key doing this.\n\n690\n00:35:19.645 --> 00:35:22.610\nSo we're gonna have chosen\nplain text like features.\n\n691\n00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:26.730\nPlain text, cipher text, we're gonna work\non those two, moving bits around and\n\n692\n00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:28.600\nshifting them in different ways.\n\n693\n00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:30.160\nTrying to see what that outcome is.\n\n694\n00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:31.810\nThe dog is blue, okay,\n\n695\n00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:36.095\nthat enciphers into whatever the string\nwould be, abc123 or whatever that is.\n\n696\n00:35:36.095 --> 00:35:41.365\nSo let's try the dog is blue, but\nlet's spell blue b-l-u instead of b-l-u-e.\n\n697\n00:35:41.365 --> 00:35:43.165\nLet's start manipulating in other words.\n\n698\n00:35:43.165 --> 00:35:47.055\nAnd as we linearly, in sequence,\nmanipulate individual bits,\n\n699\n00:35:47.055 --> 00:35:48.185\nwe see changes.\n\n700\n00:35:48.185 --> 00:35:51.815\nAnd if we do enough of this, right, we may\nbe able to derive what the key looks like.\n\n701\n00:35:51.815 --> 00:35:54.935\nThat's the thought process anyway\nbehind linear cryptanalysis.\n\n702\n00:35:54.935 --> 00:35:57.775\nWe gotta have a large volume\nof data to analyze and\n\n703\n00:35:57.775 --> 00:36:01.180\nremember, there's no guarantee here\nthat we're gonna be successful.\n\n704\n00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:04.715\nWe are chipping away at this and\nguessing at various aspects and\n\n705\n00:36:04.715 --> 00:36:08.340\nyou ever hear the analogy\nabout how you eat an elephant?\n\n706\n00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:09.165\n&gt;&gt; One bite at a time.\n\n707\n00:36:09.165 --> 00:36:10.760\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; One bite at a time, right?\n\n708\n00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:13.890\nAnd so,\n&gt;&gt; I don't eat elephants, FYI guys and\n\n709\n00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:15.100\nladies out there.\n\n710\n00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:17.780\n&gt;&gt; That's because they're like bananas,\nit's a banana thing for her.\n\n711\n00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:19.210\n&gt;&gt; I have an elephant intolerance.\n\n712\n00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:21.370\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so no elephants, no bananas.\n\n713\n00:36:21.370 --> 00:36:24.710\nI now know what I should not get you for\nyour birthday, right?\n\n714\n00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:27.840\nSo, no elephant bananas\nunder any circumstances.\n\n715\n00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:30.773\nBut you know, when you think about how\nyou eat elephants, one bite at a time,\n\n716\n00:36:30.773 --> 00:36:31.282\nas you said.\n\n717\n00:36:31.282 --> 00:36:35.764\nWhat we're suggesting is, large problems\nthat are incredibly complex, right,\n\n718\n00:36:35.764 --> 00:36:37.108\nhave to be taken apart and\n\n719\n00:36:37.108 --> 00:36:42.320\nbroken into more manageable pieces that we\ncan manipulate, work with, and understand.\n\n720\n00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:44.780\nAnd if we're good at doing this,\nwe're going to be good,\n\n721\n00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:47.340\nultimately, at being able\nto break things down.\n\n722\n00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:52.740\nWe're going to be much better at figuring\nout how to do this kind of analysis.\n\n723\n00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:56.420\nI know we're getting\nclose to finishing up.\n\n724\n00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:58.100\nBut I have two more I just\nwanna quickly throw out,\n\n725\n00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:02.120\ndifferential and integral, or\nintegral, excuse me, cryptanalysis.\n\n726\n00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:04.320\nI have to pronounce and\nenunciate correctly.\n\n727\n00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:07.990\nBut I did just wanna mention with\nlinear cryptanalysis that when we're\n\n728\n00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:12.260\nthinking about this, remember, like\nanything else, this is our best effort.\n\n729\n00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:18.270\nIt may or may not yield results and the\ncategories linear, differential, integral.\n\n730\n00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:22.510\nThese are highly complex\nmathematical enterprises.\n\n731\n00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:26.570\nThese are really difficult\napproaches to deploy and use.\n\n732\n00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:27.600\nThey're not easy.\n\n733\n00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:29.840\nThere are tools that help\nus to do these things.\n\n734\n00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:31.190\nBut they are difficult.\n\n735\n00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:34.510\nThe mathematics associated\nwith the bit-shifting and\n\n736\n00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:37.890\nthe manipulation to try to\nfigure this out are complex.\n\n737\n00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:41.270\nAnd we've talked about some mathematics\nthat are, a little bit complex,\n\n738\n00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:42.620\nwe've tried to make them approachable and\n\n739\n00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:45.310\nunderstandable as we've gone\nthrough episodes with you.\n\n740\n00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:48.640\nBut when you look at some of\nthe formulas associated with this stuff,\n\n741\n00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.120\nit is difficult.\n\n742\n00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:53.540\nAnd I'm not suggesting you can't do it,\nI'm just pointing out that.\n\n743\n00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:57.400\nIt sounds, how hard could that be,\nI'll shift some bits and figure it out.\n\n744\n00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.650\nIt sounds easy until you try to do it.\n\n745\n00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:03.900\nThese things are hard for many reasons,\nthe mathematics is one of them, and\n\n746\n00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:07.650\nyou really need to understand\nnot just how to do this, but\n\n747\n00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:10.420\nhave an understanding of\nthe math to be truly successful.\n\n748\n00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:13.900\nBecause it's not enough to push a button\nand hope that that's just gonna work.\n\n749\n00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:16.880\nBecause you have to actually understand\nthe underlying mechanics to really be\n\n750\n00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.400\ngood at this stuff.\n\n751\n00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:21.210\nWe have differential cryptanalysis.\n\n752\n00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:23.758\nThis is specific to\nsymmetric key algorithms.\n\n753\n00:38:23.758 --> 00:38:27.680\nSo differential cryptanalysis\nis a specific targeted approach\n\n754\n00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:31.330\nthat we use to try to break\nsymmetric key cryptography.\n\n755\n00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:33.228\nSingle key, private key only, right?\n\n756\n00:38:33.228 --> 00:38:34.600\nSo you use,specifically there.\n\n757\n00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:37.590\nInvented by Eli Biham and Adi Shamir.\n\n758\n00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:40.530\nWe've talked about these gentlemen\nbefore in various places.\n\n759\n00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:43.270\nAdi Shamir is one of\nthe principals involved with RSA.\n\n760\n00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:45.130\nSo you've heard me speak about him before.\n\n761\n00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:47.665\nAnd we've talked talked about Mr.\nBiham as well.\n\n762\n00:38:47.665 --> 00:38:50.905\nHe was involved in several of\nthe algorithms that we talked about\n\n763\n00:38:50.905 --> 00:38:52.985\nwhen we went through things like Tiger,\nand and and\n\n764\n00:38:52.985 --> 00:38:56.955\nall those algorithms we went through\nin symmetric and asymmetric.\n\n765\n00:38:56.955 --> 00:38:59.955\nWe talked about him, he was involved\nwith Schneer, Bruce Schneer,\n\n766\n00:38:59.955 --> 00:39:04.175\nyour buddy, right, in several different\nalgorithms that were created.\n\n767\n00:39:04.175 --> 00:39:05.865\nAnd actually have become very famous.\n\n768\n00:39:05.865 --> 00:39:08.520\nHe was involved in a couple of those,\nso you may remember his name.\n\n769\n00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:12.567\nWe examine differences in input and how\nthat will affect, ultimately, the output.\n\n770\n00:39:12.567 --> 00:39:16.170\nSo again, we're looking at,\ncan I manipulate the input?\n\n771\n00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:20.716\nCan I then see the effect, the avalanche\neffect that Feistel talks about,\n\n772\n00:39:20.716 --> 00:39:25.625\nthat Horst Feistel, that we've referred\nto many, many times, spoke about and\n\n773\n00:39:25.625 --> 00:39:26.870\ncreated this idea.\n\n774\n00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:28.230\nAnd documented it for\n\n775\n00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:31.975\nus out of Claude Shannon's concept of\ndiffusion that we've also spoken about.\n\n776\n00:39:31.975 --> 00:39:35.541\nThis idea of the avalanche effect is\nreally what we're playing on here with\n\n777\n00:39:35.541 --> 00:39:37.080\ndifferential cryptanalysis.\n\n778\n00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:39.979\nIf we can manipulate the bits\non the front end and\n\n779\n00:39:39.979 --> 00:39:44.766\nunderstand that impact on the backend,\nwe can again start to work backwards,\n\n780\n00:39:44.766 --> 00:39:48.537\nnarrowing our focus scoping and\ntailoring Filtering down and\n\n781\n00:39:48.537 --> 00:39:53.670\ntrying to see what those exact chains\nequal, we may be able to find the key.\n\n782\n00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:57.610\nRemember we've talked about this before,\nthe secret here without exception,\n\n783\n00:39:57.610 --> 00:40:03.080\nmassive, massive key spaces,\nincredibly long work factors, right?\n\n784\n00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:07.810\nIf our key spaces are big and our work\nfactors are extended as a result of that,\n\n785\n00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:11.940\neven with these methods, it's highly\nunlikely that somebody will be successful\n\n786\n00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:14.460\nin what we would refer to as\na reasonable amount of time.\n\n787\n00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:16.850\nAnd that's what we're going for,\n\n788\n00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:21.959\nis protection that is afforded to\nthe encrypted message or encrypted data.\n\n789\n00:40:21.959 --> 00:40:25.810\nNothing lasts forever cause we said,\ngiven enough time and resources,\n\n790\n00:40:25.810 --> 00:40:28.940\nsomebody will eventually\nbreak the cryptography.\n\n791\n00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:33.730\nBut rather last long enough to\noutlast the retention period and\n\n792\n00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:35.846\noutlast the usefulness of that data.\n\n793\n00:40:35.846 --> 00:40:39.570\nThat is the bar, that is the gold\nstandard that we measure by.\n\n794\n00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:44.580\nNot forever but whatever the accepted time\nperiod is we define that as being, we\n\n795\n00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:48.360\ncall that attention period traditionally,\nthat's what we're targeting, right?\n\n796\n00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:50.201\nLast one, integral cryptanalysis,\n\n797\n00:40:50.201 --> 00:40:53.488\nremember all three of these that\nhave cryptanalysis in their name.\n\n798\n00:40:53.488 --> 00:40:57.755\nAll mathematical approaches\nthat are more complex but\n\n799\n00:40:57.755 --> 00:41:04.340\nuse some advanced mathematics to be\nessentially executed if you will and used.\n\n800\n00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:08.560\nSo, integral cryptanalysis,\nsimilar to differential cryptanalysis, but\n\n801\n00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:11.410\nwe use a slightly different technique and\nmodification.\n\n802\n00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:18.100\nWe use sets of, or even multi-sets, so\nlots of different sets of plain-text.\n\n803\n00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:20.770\nSo, it's like a chosen plain-text attack,\n\n804\n00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:23.590\nwhere we're choosing the plain-text,\nseeing the cipher text.\n\n805\n00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:27.349\nAnd what we're doing is we're holding\nconstant portions of the plain-text and\n\n806\n00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:29.750\nmanipulating other portions as we go.\n\n807\n00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:32.850\nAnd through all those manipulations,\nlooking for\n\n808\n00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:35.880\nvariations that we can then zero in on.\n\n809\n00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:38.490\nReally there's a theme here if\nyou have been paying attention,\n\n810\n00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:41.030\nyou've been listening to\nthe different explanations.\n\n811\n00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:43.581\nEvery one of them,\nalmost without exception,\n\n812\n00:41:43.581 --> 00:41:46.655\nis gonna try to manipulate one or\nmore inputs in some way.\n\n813\n00:41:46.655 --> 00:41:48.888\nTo then see what the outputs are and\n\n814\n00:41:48.888 --> 00:41:53.893\nwork backwards through that manipulation\nchain changing things and holding\n\n815\n00:41:53.893 --> 00:41:59.450\nthings constant in various combinations to\nbetter understand what our options are.\n\n816\n00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:03.953\nWhat those different outcomes are, and\neliminate possible and obvious wrongs and\n\n817\n00:42:03.953 --> 00:42:06.520\nzero in on possible and obvious rights.\n\n818\n00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:08.850\nAnd that's what we're doing\nby narrowing our pool,\n\n819\n00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:11.590\nour selection pool through\nthis manipulation processes.\n\n820\n00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:15.050\nBut every one of this crypt\nanalysis approaches involves\n\n821\n00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:17.710\nhaving information that\nwe can hold constant.\n\n822\n00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:22.790\nAnd then through specific manipulations of\nthat information, looking it outcomes and\n\n823\n00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:25.500\nthen filtering out what those\noptions maybe as a result.\n\n824\n00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:28.070\nThat's really the secret\nof what we do here.\n\n825\n00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:29.020\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds great.\n\n826\n00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:34.200\nWell, I don't know if our plan is to\ncontinue to take these concepts and\n\n827\n00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:37.680\nthen show how we could execute\nthose in the next episode.\n\n828\n00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:38.660\nI'm trying to do a teaser here.\n\n829\n00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:39.300\nAdam, what do you think?\n\n830\n00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:44.480\nA cliffhanger!\n\n831\n00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.630\n&gt;&gt; I don't know,\nI don't know, I'm not sure.\n\n832\n00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:49.240\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nwe'll have to leave them guessing here.\n\n833\n00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:51.240\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna do my evil laugh,\nyou didn't get me-\n\n834\n00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:52.020\n&gt;&gt; You have an evil laugh?\n\n835\n00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:53.840\n&gt;&gt; I don't,\nI was just hoping you would do one for me,\n\n836\n00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:55.490\ncuz my throat is sore-\n&gt;&gt; Ha ha ha!\n\n837\n00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:57.170\n&gt;&gt; One more time?\nMuah-ha-ha.\n\n838\n00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:58.440\n&gt;&gt; No, no-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n839\n00:42:58.440 --> 00:42:59.610\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna do it.\n\n840\n00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:02.180\nShowing her is like giving\nthe whole magic away.\n\n841\n00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:04.340\nI was gonna make it look like I,\nforget it, we blew that one.\n\n842\n00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:05.295\nWe're not gonna do that one.\n\n843\n00:43:05.295 --> 00:43:05.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right.\n\n844\n00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:07.820\n&gt;&gt; Anyway, yes, we are gonna come back.\n\n845\n00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:09.330\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And we are gonna talk in our next\n\n846\n00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:11.130\nepisode, not just talk about,\n\n847\n00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:14.180\nbecause we do a lot of talking,\nwe also wanna do a little showing.\n\n848\n00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:17.740\nWe've talked about rainbow tables before,\ntalked about the idea of how to use them,\n\n849\n00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:19.790\nthought we would actually\njust do a little demo.\n\n850\n00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:24.150\nAnd actually show everybody out there how\nwe could take a rainbow table, put it into\n\n851\n00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:29.500\na software package that affords us\nthe ability to do these kinds of attacks.\n\n852\n00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:31.030\nAnd just show you how to set that up.\n\n853\n00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:33.640\nSo we'll actually take a look at that\nas a part of password cracking and\n\n854\n00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:36.160\nwe'll wrap up our conversations\naround cryptanalysis.\n\n855\n00:43:36.160 -->

00:00:08.468\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.468 --> 00:00:12.336\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.336 --> 00:00:16.580\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your ECES series,\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.130\nThis episode is actually a continuation\nof a previous discussion\n\n7\n00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.470\nfocused around cryptanalysis.\n\n8\n00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.620\nAnd with us today we have Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.090\nAdam Gordon in the studio to help\nus continue this conversation.\n\n10\n00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.530\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n11\n00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:29.482\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n12\n00:00:29.482 --> 00:00:33.760\nSuch a nice, pleasant experience here\nat ITPro.TV, everybody's so friendly.\n\n13\n00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.350\nThank you for being here,\nthank you for saying things.\n\n14\n00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, thank you, thank you.\n\n15\n00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.460\nI love it when people are gracious.\n\n16\n00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.800\nSo I do appreciate the opportunity\nto spend time with you, and\n\n17\n00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.440\nto spend time with all of you.\n\n18\n00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.800\nLet's talk a little bit more as Cherokee\nsaid, cuz this is a continuation,\n\n19\n00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.122\na part deux, as we say, or duet-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n20\n00:00:51.122 --> 00:00:52.611\n&gt;&gt; Depending on where you come from.\n\n21\n00:00:52.611 --> 00:00:54.485\nSo let's talk a bit more\nabout cryptanalysis.\n\n22\n00:00:54.485 --> 00:00:56.885\nIn the last episode,\nif you did not get a chance to watch it,\n\n23\n00:00:56.885 --> 00:00:59.220\nprobably wanna make sure you go back,\ntake a look.\n\n24\n00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.447\nWe talked a little bit about the different\ntacks that can be used to break\n\n25\n00:01:03.447 --> 00:01:05.218\ncryptography protections.\n\n26\n00:01:05.218 --> 00:01:09.965\nTalk about chosen plaintext,\nciphertext only, linear cryptanalysis,\n\n27\n00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:15.460\ndifferential cryptanalysis, integral\ncryptanalysis, related key attacks.\n\n28\n00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.003\nA whole bunch of stuff to say\nabout how that stuff work, and\n\n29\n00:01:19.003 --> 00:01:23.196\nwe wanna think about the fact that\nthe resources required to be able to\n\n30\n00:01:23.196 --> 00:01:25.669\nsuccessfully perform cryptanalysis.\n\n31\n00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:30.142\nThere are three things, three inputs,\nthat we must have in order to be able\n\n32\n00:01:30.142 --> 00:01:33.140\nto be successful with\nregards to cryptanalysis.\n\n33\n00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.364\nYou have any idea what they are?\n\n34\n00:01:34.364 --> 00:01:40.023\n&gt;&gt; Time, memory, and I don't remember.\n\n35\n00:01:40.023 --> 00:01:41.193\n&gt;&gt; We have all the time\nin the world at least-\n\n36\n00:01:41.193 --> 00:01:42.062\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n37\n00:01:42.062 --> 00:01:42.933\n&gt;&gt; 30 minutes of it anyway.\n\n38\n00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:44.930\n&gt;&gt; I wanna say budget, but\nI don't think that's it.\n\n39\n00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.315\n&gt;&gt; No, not budget, but your close though,\nso time memory, right.\n\n40\n00:01:48.315 --> 00:01:50.886\nYou said time, you said memory\ndefinitely two of the three and\n\n41\n00:01:50.886 --> 00:01:53.864\nthe most obvious one in some respect so\nwe don't always think about it.\n\n42\n00:01:53.864 --> 00:01:56.759\nBecause you would think well maybe I\nneed money, I need resources, right?\n\n43\n00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.336\nAbsolutely, but what are we gonna operate\non, what are we trying to understand?\n\n44\n00:01:59.336 --> 00:02:01.900\n&gt;&gt; The secret, the information.\n\n45\n00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.940\n&gt;&gt; And what do we generically\ncall the secret information?\n\n46\n00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:05.445\n&gt;&gt; Data.\n\n47\n00:02:05.445 --> 00:02:06.522\n&gt;&gt; That's what we call it, exactly.\n\n48\n00:02:06.522 --> 00:02:10.550\nSo we need time, we need memory,\nand we need data.\n\n49\n00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.290\nOr in some way,\nwe need information, right?\n\n50\n00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.910\nWe need the ability to unrestricted,\nright?\n\n51\n00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.635\nBe able to work on it, and\nwe need the capacity in our system.\n\n52\n00:02:19.635 --> 00:02:23.436\nWe say memory, we essentially just mean\nthe resources, the computing power,\n\n53\n00:02:23.436 --> 00:02:24.125\nthe storage.\n\n54\n00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:28.365\nTo be able to manipulate work with\nthe data and interact with it.\n\n55\n00:02:28.365 --> 00:02:31.650\nAnd indirectly that does mean money,\ncuz we also have to fund those activities.\n\n56\n00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.840\nAnd so we would wrap that around with the\nidea of the budget of some kind as well.\n\n57\n00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.680\nSo we absolutely need all of\nthose things to be successful.\n\n58\n00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.040\nBut in addition to\nneeding those resources,\n\n59\n00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.520\nwe also have to talk a little bit\nabout how we measure success.\n\n60\n00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.708\nIt's easy to say, hey, I did this.\n\n61\n00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:51.210\nI broke the cryptographic protection.\n\n62\n00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.401\nHere's the plain text, here's what they\ncypher text was and here's the key.\n\n63\n00:02:55.401 --> 00:02:59.461\nBut how do we really know for sure and\nwhat kind of success are we claiming and\n\n64\n00:02:59.461 --> 00:03:00.850\nwhat do we call that?\n\n65\n00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:01.733\nWe have different categories of success.\n\n66\n00:03:01.733 --> 00:03:05.964\nIn other words, that we can shoot for\napproximations of different activities and\n\n67\n00:03:05.964 --> 00:03:07.865\nthey yield different results.\n\n68\n00:03:07.865 --> 00:03:09.413\nCuz we don't know who\nalways get the magic key.\n\n69\n00:03:09.413 --> 00:03:14.770\nI mean, it's very unlikely that we will\nactually be successful and find the key.\n\n70\n00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.530\nSo more often than not,\nit's a graded scale of success.\n\n71\n00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.690\nWe got something, but\nperhaps didn't get everything, and so\n\n72\n00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:22.740\nthis is what we need to think about.\n\n73\n00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.651\nSo we would classify success\nin some different ways.\n\n74\n00:03:25.651 --> 00:03:27.814\nIf we have what's called a total break,\n\n75\n00:03:27.814 --> 00:03:31.200\nthe ability to be able to get\nthe key is what we're describing.\n\n76\n00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.120\nIf the attack or\nthe cryptanalysis is successful and\n\n77\n00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.130\nthe cryptoanalyst is able\nto create a total break.\n\n78\n00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.420\nThey have actually found the key, that's\nthe golden standard that we shoot for,\n\n79\n00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.370\nbut where that we get there, right?\n\n80\n00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.160\nWe don't know who is get the keys.\n\n81\n00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.030\nIn a matter of fact more often than not,\nwe may not get the key.\n\n82\n00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.422\nSo that is one, but\nmaybe not be the way we met for success.\n\n83\n00:03:50.422 --> 00:03:53.580\nWhat about the global deduction?\n\n84\n00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.372\nThat's an interesting one,\nso global deduction.\n\n85\n00:03:55.372 --> 00:04:00.377\nGlobal deduction implies that the attacker\ndiscovers the equivalent algorithm or\n\n86\n00:04:00.377 --> 00:04:05.550\nthat we call functionally equivalent\nalgorithm for encryption and decryption.\n\n87\n00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.420\nSo we understand that very important\nelement in the middle of the cryptosystem,\n\n88\n00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.160\nthe mechanics of what's making it work,\nbut we don't actually get the key.\n\n89\n00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.980\nSo we understand or derive the algorithm\nand the settings around it, and\n\n90\n00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.166\nhow it's used.\n\n91\n00:04:20.166 --> 00:04:21.851\nIt's AES 192-bit with\nthis number of rounds.\n\n92\n00:04:21.851 --> 00:04:25.460\nWe would figure all that out, but\nwe wouldn't actually have the key.\n\n93\n00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.270\nThat's called a global deduction, at least\nin the language of what we're talking\n\n94\n00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.830\nabout or sometimes referred\nto as a local deduction.\n\n95\n00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.266\nWe talked about global deduction, we could\ntalk about something called the local\n\n96\n00:04:37.266 --> 00:04:39.625\ndeduction or\nsometimes called an instance deduction.\n\n97\n00:04:39.625 --> 00:04:43.093\nIt's essentially the same thing.\nThe attacker discovers additional plain\n\n98\n00:04:43.093 --> 00:04:44.670\ntext or ciphertext.\n\n99\n00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.169\nRemember we tend to operate\non both sides of that divide,\n\n100\n00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:49.001\nthat may not have been previously known.\n\n101\n00:04:49.001 --> 00:04:53.314\nSo we deduce some of the supporting\noutside of the actual\n\n102\n00:04:53.314 --> 00:04:55.280\nalgorithm in the key.\n\n103\n00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.140\nBut we don't actually get the algorithm or\nthe key,\n\n104\n00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.620\nwe're just getting\nthe pieces on either side.\n\n105\n00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.540\nRemember we're nibbling away, right?\n\n106\n00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.885\nI'm not gonna use the word elephant,\ncuz I know you have the whole-\n\n107\n00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:03.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n108\n00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:04.994\n&gt;&gt; Elephant banana,\n\n109\n00:05:04.994 --> 00:05:09.180\nthing going on that's just ugly, so\nwe're not gonna talk about that.\n\n110\n00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.210\nBut we are nibbling away at those aspects,\nright?\n\n111\n00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.290\nWe're just kinda thinking about what's\non the edges, and trying to find them.\n\n112\n00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.620\nWhat about information deduction?\n\n113\n00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.190\nInformation deduction, another category or\nway of measuring success.\n\n114\n00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.130\nWe gain information or\nunderstanding about a plain text or\n\n115\n00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.770\ncypher text that was not previously known.\n\n116\n00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.748\nSo it's similar to instance or\nlocal deduction.\n\n117\n00:05:29.748 --> 00:05:34.270\nBut in instance and local deduction,\nwe are actually finding plain text or\n\n118\n00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.380\nciphertext previously unknown.\n\n119\n00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.080\nIn the information deduction, we\nare understanding more information about\n\n120\n00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.750\nthose plain text or\nciphertext that was not known before.\n\n121\n00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.610\nBut not finding them themselves, right?\n\n122\n00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.660\nSo there is a small but important\ndistinction between those two categories.\n\n123\n00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.120\nOne is about finding new information,\nthe other one is about finding information\n\n124\n00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.970\nabout what we've already found that may be\nnew or novel that we have not seen before.\n\n125\n00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.800\nAnd then distinguishing algorithm,\nthis is where we can distinguish or\n\n126\n00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.050\nunderstand cypher from some\nsort of random permutation.\n\n127\n00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.130\nIn other words,\nwe essentially can deduce the algorithm or\n\n128\n00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.700\nunderstand it based on\ninformation we find.\n\n129\n00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.470\nSo we say we're successful if we deduce\nthe algorithm, if we are able to deduce\n\n130\n00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:22.090\ninformation or deduce locally or\nglobally, or have a total break, right?\n\n131\n00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.257\nThis is the language we would often use to\nclassify to categorize different success\n\n132\n00:06:26.257 --> 00:06:27.574\nlevels we may encounter.\n\n133\n00:06:27.574 --> 00:06:29.243\nSo just some interesting stuff, right?\n\n134\n00:06:29.243 --> 00:06:29.905\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n135\n00:06:29.905 --> 00:06:32.057\n&gt;&gt; You could also just say yeah,\nI did it, that would also be equally.\n\n136\n00:06:32.057 --> 00:06:33.073\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n137\n00:06:33.073 --> 00:06:34.520\nyou gotta throw something\ndown when you do that,\n\n138\n00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.730\nthen it's equally cool or impressive.\n\n139\n00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.185\n&gt;&gt; Drop your mic.\n&gt;&gt; Drop the mic, well we did-\n\n140\n00:06:37.185 --> 00:06:38.262\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n141\n00:06:38.262 --> 00:06:39.244\n&gt;&gt; The drop the key thing, but\n\n142\n00:06:39.244 --> 00:06:40.916\nthen we gotta do the whole\nkey drumroll thing.\n\n143\n00:06:40.916 --> 00:06:44.433\nAnd we agreed that drumrolls are good,\nbut-\n\n144\n00:06:44.433 --> 00:06:45.143\n&gt;&gt; Not my strong suit.\n\n145\n00:06:45.143 --> 00:06:46.238\n&gt;&gt; Not your strong suit.\n\n146\n00:06:46.238 --> 00:06:48.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we're not gonna go with that.\n\n147\n00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.160\nAll right, so we did promise\nall of the good folk out there\n\n148\n00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.810\nin ITPro.TV land that we\nwould show them something.\n\n149\n00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.280\nAnd we said, we would show them how\nto do a little password cracking.\n\n150\n00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.800\nNow we're gonna do something novel.\n\n151\n00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.270\nWhile we're talking, Cherokee and\nI are going to switch places and\n\n152\n00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.512\nwe're actually gonna have\nCherokee do the demonstration.\n\n153\n00:07:06.512 --> 00:07:07.516\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Would that be cool?\n\n154\n00:07:07.516 --> 00:07:10.135\n&gt;&gt; Shape shifting sure, I'll try it.\n\n155\n00:07:10.135 --> 00:07:10.927\n&gt;&gt; You wanna try it?\n\n156\n00:07:10.927 --> 00:07:12.186\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you're gonna pretend to be me.\n\n157\n00:07:12.186 --> 00:07:12.973\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n158\n00:07:12.973 --> 00:07:15.349\n&gt;&gt; Right, so just gotta concentrate.\n\n159\n00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:17.261\n&gt;&gt; Concentrate really hard-\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n160\n00:07:17.261 --> 00:07:19.266\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so no, but Cherokee is actually\n\n161\n00:07:19.266 --> 00:07:20.950\ngonna help me with this we're not\ngonna put her on the spot and\n\n162\n00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:22.200\nmake her do the demonstration.\n\n163\n00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.620\nBut I am gonna ask her to help\nme with this in one respect.\n\n164\n00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.068\nSo what I would like Cherokee to do,\nand we didn't plan this ahead of time.\n\n165\n00:07:28.068 --> 00:07:30.822\nSo she's gonna need a second to\nprepare while we do this, but\n\n166\n00:07:30.822 --> 00:07:33.207\ncould you bring up the project\nrainbows site for me.\n\n167\n00:07:33.207 --> 00:07:36.048\nSo as I'm actually doing, and\ndon't rush we got plenty of time.\n\n168\n00:07:36.048 --> 00:07:39.163\nBring it up and\nthen we'll go to it in a minute.\n\n169\n00:07:39.163 --> 00:07:41.714\nBut that way once I show it, and\nthen we bring up the software and\n\n170\n00:07:41.714 --> 00:07:43.900\nthen we're going to start\ntalking about how to do it.\n\n171\n00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.408\nWe could still occasionally cut\nto your machine and see it,\n\n172\n00:07:46.408 --> 00:07:49.533\ninstead of flipping through 25\ndifferent screens to get there, okay?\n\n173\n00:07:49.533 --> 00:07:51.786\nSo let me give Cherokee\njust a second to get ready.\n\n174\n00:07:51.786 --> 00:07:54.943\nBut general thought process, what we're\nabout to do here is the following.\n\n175\n00:07:54.943 --> 00:07:59.251\nWe talked about password cracking in\none or two episodes prior to this.\n\n176\n00:07:59.251 --> 00:08:02.710\nTalked about the ideas of rainbow\ntables and why they're important.\n\n177\n00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:06.178\nAnd we thought, you know, hey, wouldn't it\nbe cool if we just brought those together,\n\n178\n00:08:06.178 --> 00:08:08.908\ngave you a quick little idea of what\nit may look like in the real world for\n\n179\n00:08:08.908 --> 00:08:10.138\nyou to do something like this.\n\n180\n00:08:10.138 --> 00:08:11.680\nSo set up a little demo.\n\n181\n00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.361\nWe're gonna use a favorite tool of mine,\none of the tools we use often.\n\n182\n00:08:14.361 --> 00:08:15.925\nA tool called Cain and Abel.\n\n183\n00:08:15.925 --> 00:08:17.175\nIt's kind of an oldie, right?\n\n184\n00:08:17.175 --> 00:08:18.105\nBut it's a goodie.\n\n185\n00:08:18.105 --> 00:08:21.765\nYou can use L0phtCrack,\npwdump, pwdump2, Ophcrack.\n\n186\n00:08:21.765 --> 00:08:23.731\nThere's different tools you\ncould use to do this, but\n\n187\n00:08:23.731 --> 00:08:25.110\nwe're gonna demo with Cain and Abel.\n\n188\n00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:29.117\nI'm gonna show you, in other words, how we\ndump the hashes from the system and then\n\n189\n00:08:29.117 --> 00:08:33.025\nwe're going to look at different kinds of\nattacks we can use mount against them.\n\n190\n00:08:33.025 --> 00:08:35.867\nAnd one of the attacks is\na rainbow table attacks.\n\n191\n00:08:35.867 --> 00:08:38.009\nWe're just going to show you\nhow we will integrate that and\n\n192\n00:08:38.009 --> 00:08:39.967\nhow you would actually\nexecute that in the system.\n\n193\n00:08:39.967 --> 00:08:41.957\nSo what we're going to\ndo is just start out.\n\n194\n00:08:41.957 --> 00:08:46.474\nAnd we're going to, you just want\nto go to project-rainbow.com.\n\n195\n00:08:46.474 --> 00:08:50.270\n[CROSSTALK] ,com, all one word.\n\n196\n00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:53.630\nAnd then there you'll be able to just,\nyou know, have the main page loaded up.\n\n197\n00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:56.057\nSo what we're gonna do\nis we're gonna go and\n\n198\n00:08:56.057 --> 00:08:58.953\njust quickly remind you of\nwhat rainbow tables are.\n\n199\n00:08:58.953 --> 00:09:03.646\nRemember, these are the pre-computer hash\ntables that we, somebody has gone out and\n\n200\n00:09:03.646 --> 00:09:05.455\ngone to the trouble of creating.\n\n201\n00:09:05.455 --> 00:09:07.520\nIt may have been us,\nit may have been somebody else.\n\n202\n00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.880\nA lot of times we'll download\nthem from the Internet.\n\n203\n00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.210\nSo we won't actually have\nto create them ourselves.\n\n204\n00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:16.870\nAnd we'll go out and we will use one or\nmore of these tables.\n\n205\n00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:21.087\nWe'll import them into a tool\nof some kind, as I mentioned.\n\n206\n00:09:21.087 --> 00:09:25.070\nL0phtCrack, OphCrack, pwdump,\nJohn the Ripper, Cain and Abel.\n\n207\n00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:28.510\nThere's just hundreds of\nthese tools that you can use.\n\n208\n00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:32.931\nEvery one of them works essentially the\nsame way, and as result we're going to go\n\n209\n00:09:32.931 --> 00:09:36.182\nahead and we're then going to\nbring that information in and\n\n210\n00:09:36.182 --> 00:09:40.082\nallow us to use it to run against\nthe hashes that either we've sniffed or\n\n211\n00:09:40.082 --> 00:09:42.580\nthat we've somehow\nmanaged to get a hold of.\n\n212\n00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:46.025\nSo what we're gonna do is take\na look at the RainbowCrack site or\n\n213\n00:09:46.025 --> 00:09:48.210\nthe project RainbowCrack tables.\n\n214\n00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:49.650\nI'll do it on my machine, no big deal.\n\n215\n00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:51.080\nJust bring up, if you could, right?\n\n216\n00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:57.030\nThat's what it would look like if we\nwere able to bring the [CROSSTALK].\n\n217\n00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:00.290\nIt may or may not be, no big deal,\nwe'll just do it here, no problem.\n\n218\n00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:02.760\nSo we have the project\nRainbowCrack website.\n\n219\n00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.470\nWe've given you this URL before.\n\n220\n00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:06.250\nIt'll be in the show notes again for\nthis episode,\n\n221\n00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:07.720\njust to remind you where to find it.\n\n222\n00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.890\nSo you could go in here and you can go and\n\n223\n00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:14.000\nyou can download just by going\nup here to rainbow tables.\n\n224\n00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.315\nYou can go and\ntake a look at the rainbow tables.\n\n225\n00:10:16.315 --> 00:10:18.907\nLet me just click there so\nwe can get that to actually go and\n\n226\n00:10:18.907 --> 00:10:20.698\nyou can see the list of rainbow tables.\n\n227\n00:10:20.698 --> 00:10:23.200\nWe'd shown you this in a prior episode.\n\n228\n00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.181\nWe have our LM rainbow tables,\nour NTLM rainbow tables, and\n\n229\n00:10:26.181 --> 00:10:28.235\nyou would download the appropriate one.\n\n230\n00:10:28.235 --> 00:10:33.002\nIf you want the ASCII character set for\nup to seven plain text length character\n\n231\n00:10:33.002 --> 00:10:37.520\npasswords or hashes,\nyou would go through, download this one.\n\n232\n00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:42.060\nAlmost 100% guarantee that the hash that\nyou have will be contained in this rainbow\n\n233\n00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.970\ntable, that kind of thing.\n\n234\n00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:46.660\nAnd you could see, depending on\nwhat we're doing, one to eight,\n\n235\n00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:50.140\nyou could see the factor of difficulty\ngoes up based on the number\n\n236\n00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:52.920\nof possible permutations on the key space.\n\n237\n00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.420\nAnd you know, we're at 96.8% success.\n\n238\n00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:56.794\nI'd still take those odds.\n\n239\n00:10:56.794 --> 00:11:00.682\nI mean, a 3% chance that I'm gonna\nnot find the hash is a pretty good\n\n240\n00:11:00.682 --> 00:11:01.698\nchance, right?\n\n241\n00:11:01.698 --> 00:11:03.110\nSo we just want to think about that.\n\n242\n00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:05.570\nSo we would download\nthe appropriate rainbow table.\n\n243\n00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.714\nSo let's assume you've done\nthat in some form, right?\n\n244\n00:11:07.714 --> 00:11:10.310\nAnd then what we're gonna\ndo is the following.\n\n245\n00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:13.739\nWe're gonna come up here and\nit got turned off, how did that happen?\n\n246\n00:11:13.739 --> 00:11:14.563\nGive me one second.\n\n247\n00:11:14.563 --> 00:11:16.130\nJust have to connect back in.\n\n248\n00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:18.779\n&gt;&gt; Should we throw out a disclaimer\nabout using these types of tools?\n\n249\n00:11:18.779 --> 00:11:20.154\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely not.\n\n250\n00:11:20.154 --> 00:11:22.900\n[LAUGH] No, we should, I'm only kidding.\n\n251\n00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:26.150\nLet me just start my VM back up, it got\nturned off by accident when we were.\n\n252\n00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:28.618\nWhen we were waiting on\nthe demo to get spun up and\n\n253\n00:11:28.618 --> 00:11:30.852\nwe were doing some work behind the scenes.\n\n254\n00:11:30.852 --> 00:11:32.352\nI think I may have hit the wrong button.\n\n255\n00:11:32.352 --> 00:11:36.430\nSo yeah, it is important to be\nable to think about the fact,\n\n256\n00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:41.770\nas Cherokee was pointing out, that these\ntools and techniques like this are things\n\n257\n00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:46.680\nthat we don't deploy lightly and certainly\nwe don't want to use without the proper\n\n258\n00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:51.440\nthought process, oversight, and\nunderstanding of risk and liability.\n\n259\n00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.730\nIt's very, very important for\nus to consider the fact and\n\n260\n00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:59.860\nbe aware of the fact that we are showing\nyou tools and techniques that\n\n261\n00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:04.490\ncan certainly be used for good, but\nalso can be used for not so good, right?\n\n262\n00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:07.020\nAnd if you use them incorrectly or\n\n263\n00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:12.640\nin some way use them without paying\nattention to the concerns, capabilities,\n\n264\n00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:16.270\nand rules that we would put in place\nto prevent bad things from happening.\n\n265\n00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:19.470\nThen you may do damage without meaning\nto and that's very important for\n\n266\n00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:20.820\nyou to be aware of and to understand.\n\n267\n00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:24.358\nSo it is a good idea for\nyou to just exercise a little due care and\n\n268\n00:12:24.358 --> 00:12:26.692\ndue dilligence here, very important.\n\n269\n00:12:26.692 --> 00:12:29.147\nLet me just bring up Cain and\nAbel, I just had it open before,\n\n270\n00:12:29.147 --> 00:12:31.240\nwe'll just bring it back up so\nyou can see it.\n\n271\n00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.720\nThis is the tool Cain and Abel.\n\n272\n00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.960\nOxid.it is the name of\nthe group that is behind this.\n\n273\n00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.750\nYou may have seen this tool before.\n\n274\n00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:42.779\nAnd what we're gonna do is come\nover here to our cracker tab, so\n\n275\n00:12:42.779 --> 00:12:45.824\nwe have little tabs in here for\ndifferent kinds of activities.\n\n276\n00:12:45.824 --> 00:12:47.043\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a little sniffer.\n\n277\n00:12:47.043 --> 00:12:48.006\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a sniffer.\n\n278\n00:12:48.006 --> 00:12:52.797\nDoes a lot of different things,\ndoes wireless sniffing, let's you go and\n\n279\n00:12:52.797 --> 00:12:57.770\ncrack a Cisco VPN passwords, RSA,\ntokens, all sort of different stuff.\n\n280\n00:12:57.770 --> 00:12:59.850\nWe do a bunch of different stuff,\nkind of a cool tool.\n\n281\n00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:03.940\nWe're gonna go to the LM and\nNTLM hash area here,\n\n282\n00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.470\nI'll just move this over just a wee bit so\nyou can see that right there.\n\n283\n00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:08.636\nThere's currently no hashes in here,\nright?\n\n284\n00:13:08.636 --> 00:13:11.130\nWe can see there's nothing\nin the system loaded up.\n\n285\n00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:15.635\nSo we go up here, we just do a capture,\nor in this case, an add slash capture.\n\n286\n00:13:15.635 --> 00:13:17.965\nWe're gonna import hashes\nfrom the local system.\n\n287\n00:13:17.965 --> 00:13:20.315\nI can include password history hashes.\n\n288\n00:13:20.315 --> 00:13:22.165\nI can import them from a text file.\n\n289\n00:13:22.165 --> 00:13:25.552\nI can go out and\nget them from the SAM file database.\n\n290\n00:13:25.552 --> 00:13:28.761\nYou know, in Windows, you're gonna\nfind this if you just go browse for\n\n291\n00:13:28.761 --> 00:13:29.625\na second, right?\n\n292\n00:13:29.625 --> 00:13:34.544\nSo if we go in here,\nlet me just move this over, and\n\n293\n00:13:34.544 --> 00:13:38.994\nwe can go in and\ninside of the Windows system,\n\n294\n00:13:38.994 --> 00:13:42.858\nwe can go in and\nwe can go into Windows and\n\n295\n00:13:42.858 --> 00:13:47.576\nwe can go in under Windows and\ndo the following.\n\n296\n00:13:50.656 --> 00:13:52.223\nWhere are we going?\n\n297\n00:13:52.223 --> 00:13:53.047\nDown there.\n\n298\n00:13:54.962 --> 00:13:58.830\nAnd in the system 32,\nin the config directory,\n\n299\n00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:02.433\nwe would typically find our SAM file,\nright?\n\n300\n00:14:02.433 --> 00:14:06.212\nSo we could go in and we could pull\nthat up for instance and bring that in.\n\n301\n00:14:06.212 --> 00:14:08.221\nThere's different ways for\nus to get information, right?\n\n302\n00:14:08.221 --> 00:14:10.093\nBut what I'm gonna do\nis I'm gonna go in and\n\n303\n00:14:10.093 --> 00:14:12.230\nI'm just gonna import it\nfrom the local system.\n\n304\n00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:15.980\nEssentially tell it to go find it for\nme without me having to browse to it.\n\n305\n00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.170\nSo let's just click there.\n\n306\n00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:20.050\nIt'll bring those up, there's three\nof them that we're gonna use here.\n\n307\n00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:23.690\nWe're gonna go in and find,\nI have an Adam1 user I created.\n\n308\n00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:26.770\nWe have the admin account that I'm logged\nin under and we have the guest account\n\n309\n00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:29.240\nwhich is disabled,\nit's not being used traditionally, right?\n\n310\n00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:32.330\nSo we have as you can see,\nalthough, they trail off,\n\n311\n00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.010\nit's gonna be hard to see the whole half.\n\n312\n00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:36.530\nBut we do have the NT hash,\nthe LM hash here.\n\n313\n00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:39.050\nSo we've dumped the hashes because\nwe're on the local machine.\n\n314\n00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:44.010\nNow the reality is you may not get\nthe opportunity to be on the local machine\n\n315\n00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:44.900\nall the time, right?\n\n316\n00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:48.600\nSo you may be sniffing to find these\nhashes being sent and received.\n\n317\n00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.450\nAnd you may pull them out of the air and\nload them up from a file.\n\n318\n00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:53.520\nSo there's different\nways these would appear.\n\n319\n00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.600\nBut what we wanted to do\nwas to take a look at\n\n320\n00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:58.600\ndifferent ways that we can launch attacks.\n\n321\n00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:04.220\nWe have dictionary attacks where we can go\nin and load up dictionary files or lists.\n\n322\n00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:08.230\nThese would be precompiled\nlists of passwords\n\n323\n00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:11.290\nthat would be used to reverse engineer or\n\n324\n00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:16.430\nfigure out what the hashes are gonna\npotentially be, or the password may be.\n\n325\n00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:17.570\nSo we could do this.\n\n326\n00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:19.390\nWe could do a brute force attack.\n\n327\n00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:20.460\nWe could go in and,\n\n328\n00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:24.868\nagain, have just a list of things\nwe want to throw at this system.\n\n329\n00:15:24.868 --> 00:15:28.200\nOr we could do the crypt analysis\nattacks that we were talking about, and\n\n330\n00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.040\nyou see we have a whole category for this.\n\n331\n00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:34.584\nAnd we have rainbow tables, by Ophcrack,\n\n332\n00:15:34.584 --> 00:15:41.060\nRainbowcrack, Winrtg or\nWinRTG, I guess you would say.\n\n333\n00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:44.910\nBut if we do something like Rainbowcrack,\nwhich is what we were just talking about,\n\n334\n00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:50.920\nwe could go in and you'll see that\nwe're able to have our rainbow files.\n\n335\n00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.589\nWe have to add the table in here.\n\n336\n00:15:52.589 --> 00:15:54.908\nSo we would have to go out and\nhave a table downloaded.\n\n337\n00:15:54.908 --> 00:15:58.278\nI haven't downloaded one because,\nas you can see, in many cases there Half\n\n338\n00:15:58.278 --> 00:16:01.279\na terabyte or bigger it would take\na long time to get one downloaded,\n\n339\n00:16:01.279 --> 00:16:04.020\nwe're just giving you the idea\nof what you would do here.\n\n340\n00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:05.700\nBut you would bring in this\ntable once you've done it.\n\n341\n00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:08.957\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] And this is kind of where\nthat memory portion falls into play too.\n\n342\n00:16:08.957 --> 00:16:11.955\nBecause you need that storage,\nit's not necessarily memory, but\n\n343\n00:16:11.955 --> 00:16:13.750\nkind of focusing around the budget too.\n\n344\n00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:17.160\nHaving a system that could\nhandle this utility.\n\n345\n00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.150\n&gt;&gt; Having the raw computing power,\nthe hard drive space,\n\n346\n00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:23.203\nthe computing capabilities all\nof that stuff will be part\n\n347\n00:16:23.203 --> 00:16:25.702\nof the resources needed for\nthis absolutely.\n\n348\n00:16:25.702 --> 00:16:29.843\nAnd so we would add the table or tables in\nand then once we're done and we got all\n\n349\n00:16:29.843 --> 00:16:33.940\nthat setup you'll see that we can then\ngo ahead and just simply click start.\n\n350\n00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:37.600\nAnd once this runs, it takes as long\nas it takes whatever it may be,\n\n351\n00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.850\neventually we will then be able to.\n\n352\n00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:42.460\nIf we do have a hash table,\n\n353\n00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:47.690\na rainbow table that has been created that\npotentially has that character set in it\n\n354\n00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:52.570\nthen we actually would eventually find our\nmatch it would just be a matter of time.\n\n355\n00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:55.580\nSo we can execute a whole bunch\nof different attacks here,\n\n356\n00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.940\nif we take a look at\nthe dictionary attack.\n\n357\n00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:00.070\nWe would have to load up dictionary files.\n\n358\n00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:03.210\nWe'd have to have those loaded up in\nthe configuration of the tool we'd specify\n\n359\n00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:08.470\nwhat dictionaries we'd wanna use but\nyou can see we can do passwords,\n\n360\n00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:12.000\nreverse them, double,\nlower case, upper case, etc.\n\n361\n00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.560\nWe could do all that and\nthen once we figured that out,\n\n362\n00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.210\nwe would be able to hopefully\nbe successful there as well.\n\n363\n00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:20.960\nWe could go in with bruit force.\n\n364\n00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:25.920\nAnd with bruit force, we specify\nthe different predefined character sets or\n\n365\n00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:26.950\na custom character set.\n\n366\n00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:30.660\nAgain it will be up to us to decide,\nbut you'll see here,\n\n367\n00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:35.320\nwe have our different options, upper case,\nalpha numeric, special characters,\n\n368\n00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:39.280\nonly numeric, only alpha,\nonly lower case, only upper case.\n\n369\n00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.690\nHere we have a lot of different options or\n\n370\n00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:46.650\nwe can do a custom character set and\nthen we can specify exactly what we want.\n\n371\n00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:49.490\nSo for instance, if I know for a fact that\n\n372\n00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:54.270\ncertain characters are not included in\nthis potential password or this hash.\n\n373\n00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:58.530\nI may drop those out and\nspeed up the potential cracking\n\n374\n00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:02.930\ntime because it will take a less time to\ndo that based on eliminating the number of\n\n375\n00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:05.900\nrounds we have to go through based on all\nthe characters we would have to test.\n\n376\n00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:09.980\nSo we could go through any of these and\nactually then if we are successful\n\n377\n00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:13.170\ngenerate on the outcome,\nwhat would be our password right.\n\n378\n00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:16.620\nAnd then we also can just\nsimply test the password right?\n\n379\n00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:20.460\nWe actually can come in as you could see\nhere, and we could test the password and\n\n380\n00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.030\nsee whether or not it matches.\n\n381\n00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:23.570\nSo we could actually put a password in,\n\n382\n00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:26.850\nsee if we are lucky enough just\nto get a guess as a one off.\n\n383\n00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:30.760\nBut with a tool like this, we also can\ndo rainbow crack online, which is nice.\n\n384\n00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.950\nYou can do this against an online system.\n\n385\n00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:36.480\nSo we actually have a lot of different\ncapabilities in a tool like this,\n\n386\n00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.620\nwhich is nice.\n\n387\n00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:41.890\nAll the different tools operate\nslightly variable to this but\n\n388\n00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:44.290\nthey have the basic concepts in them.\n\n389\n00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:47.838\nAnd so this is without going into\nthe actual step by step mechanics and\n\n390\n00:18:47.838 --> 00:18:51.339\nwaiting the 20 30 minutes or\nwhatever it may take to break this.\n\n391\n00:18:51.339 --> 00:18:54.501\nThis is what would actually be\ndone if we were going through\n\n392\n00:18:54.501 --> 00:18:57.350\nan executing a password cracking attack.\n\n393\n00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:01.077\nOr if we were going to try to\nuse a rainbow table attack\n\n394\n00:19:01.077 --> 00:19:05.416\nto tell us what the password hash is and\nderive the password.\n\n395\n00:19:05.416 --> 00:19:08.503\nThese are the approaches that we would\nuse, and this is one of the different\n\n396\n00:19:08.503 --> 00:19:11.390\nkinds of tools that may actually be\nvaluable for us in this respect.\n\n397\n00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:14.920\nSo hopefully this makes a little sense\nto you now that you've seen it and\n\n398\n00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.420\nyou're able to understand it.\n\n399\n00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.320\nYou can download tools like Cain and\nAble and\n\n400\n00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.580\nmany of these other\ntools from the Internet.\n\n401\n00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:22.740\nYou can find them out there if you\njust go out and look for them.\n\n402\n00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:26.340\nA lot of them are free, some of them\nhave demos that you can work with and or\n\n403\n00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:28.260\ndemo databases you can play with.\n\n404\n00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.604\nAnd demo licenses that can be applied.\n\n405\n00:19:30.604 --> 00:19:34.320\nFor instance, they can get a 15-day\ntrial or something like that.\n\n406\n00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.822\nThese days, if you wanna play with it.\n\n407\n00:19:35.822 --> 00:19:38.890\nCain and Abel is essentially free,\nyou don't have to license it.\n\n408\n00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:42.840\nBut keep in mind that,\nas we pointed out, as Cherokee was right\n\n409\n00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:47.060\nto remind us to point out,\nthat you are playing with a tool that,\n\n410\n00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:50.580\nin the hands of a trained professional,\ncan be used to do good.\n\n411\n00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:54.671\nBut you playing with the tool that in the\nhands of somebody who's either not trained\n\n412\n00:19:54.671 --> 00:19:58.355\nproperly or perhaps looking specifically\nto do harm not suggesting that,\n\n413\n00:19:58.355 --> 00:19:59.594\nthat would be you at all.\n\n414\n00:19:59.594 --> 00:20:03.927\nBut even inadvertently without meaning\nto do harm can actually be used to\n\n415\n00:20:03.927 --> 00:20:08.136\ncreate unintended consequences,\nunintended on look for outcomes.\n\n416\n00:20:08.136 --> 00:20:11.910\nSo if you do have to be careful there are\na lot of policies typically in place in\n\n417\n00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:13.370\nmany of your work places.\n\n418\n00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:17.073\nThat would prohibit the use of these\ntools unless you have either the proper\n\n419\n00:20:17.073 --> 00:20:20.893\nexception granted or you're a member of\nthe team that has been given rights to\n\n420\n00:20:20.893 --> 00:20:22.562\ndeploy these tools internally.\n\n421\n00:20:22.562 --> 00:20:26.018\nAnd you don't wanna just randomly spin\none of these tools up on a machine\n\n422\n00:20:26.018 --> 00:20:29.520\nto work even on the virtual machine,\neven on a isolated network.\n\n423\n00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.900\nUnless you have\nthe appropriate permission,\n\n424\n00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:33.930\nbecause that can get you\ninto a lot of trouble.\n\n425\n00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:36.830\nPeople start asking questions,\nwhy are you doing this?\n\n426\n00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:38.269\nAnd you don't want to\nhave those conversations.\n\n427\n00:20:38.269 --> 00:20:40.400\nIt's never a good thing.\n\n428\n00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.510\nSo keep in mind you want to play with\nthese tools, we encourage you to think\n\n429\n00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:46.116\nabout doing any and all the things\nthat we do here to show you and\n\n430\n00:20:46.116 --> 00:20:48.241\nhelp you to better\nunderstand this information.\n\n431\n00:20:48.241 --> 00:20:53.740\nBut do it in a secure, do it in a safe,\ndo it in a really well thought out way.\n\n432\n00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:55.700\nVirtualization is a great opportunity for\n\n433\n00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:58.590\nyou to have advantages here\nto do this kind of stuff.\n\n434\n00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:03.270\nBut do it at home on machines unowned or\nnot owned by corporate entities,\n\n435\n00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:06.250\non your own machines isolated\nfrom everything else, so\n\n436\n00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:09.360\nthat nobody's gonna have any\nquestions about what you're doing.\n\n437\n00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.850\nAnd also keep in mind that with regards to\nthese tools connecting to the Internet.\n\n438\n00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:16.770\nYour ISP may have something to say about\nthat if they find evidence of you using\n\n439\n00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:20.340\nthese tools outbound right to\ntry to connect to systems and\n\n440\n00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:21.860\ninteract with them on the web.\n\n441\n00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.606\nThey monitor for this kinda behavior\njust so you know, you don't wanna\n\n442\n00:21:24.606 --> 00:21:27.710\nget one of those nasty little cease and\ndesist letters in the mail.\n\n443\n00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:31.390\nSo just make sure you are aware of the\nfact that there is liability associated\n\n444\n00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:33.210\nwith doing these kinds of things.\n\n445\n00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:35.871\nI know you are probably\nwell aware of that, but\n\n446\n00:21:35.871 --> 00:21:39.898\nyou just wanna make sure that you\nare acting, as you always try to do and\n\n447\n00:21:39.898 --> 00:21:42.371\nwe all try to do when we\ndo this kind of work.\n\n448\n00:21:42.371 --> 00:21:45.220\nWith the best possible thoughts and\nintentions in mind.\n\n449\n00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.385\nAnd make sure that your deeds and\n\n450\n00:21:46.385 --> 00:21:49.995\nyour actions are equal to that thought\nprocess is what we're suggesting.\n\n451\n00:21:49.995 --> 00:21:51.055\nIs that a good disclaimer?\n\n452\n00:21:51.055 --> 00:21:51.675\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like it.\n\n453\n00:21:51.675 --> 00:21:53.365\n&gt;&gt; Should we have them\ninitial the screen
