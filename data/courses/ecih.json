everybody.\n\n8\n00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:17.790\nHopefully everyone's doing well.\n\n9\n00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.690\nLooking forward to spending time with you.\n\n10\n00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.660\nWhen we talk about the EC Council\nCertified Incident Handler material,\n\n11\n00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.810\nwhat we're really focusing on is\nthe understanding of what it means to\n\n12\n00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.520\nbe an incident responder,\nan incident handler, an incident manager.\n\n13\n00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.470\nAs an IT security professional, we're\ngonna be talking about the methodology,\n\n14\n00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.370\nthe techniques,\nthe thought process, the tools and\n\n15\n00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.260\nthe strategies associated\nwith incident handling and\n\n16\n00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.020\nincident response in the enterprise or in\nthe organizations that you all represent.\n\n17\n00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.750\nWe'll be talking about\nthings like risk assessment.\n\n18\n00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.420\nWhy is risk so important?\n\n19\n00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.480\nWhat does risk have to do\nwith incident handling?\n\n20\n00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.330\nWell, come on back and talk to us and\n\n21\n00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.210\nwe'll be happy to talk\nabout that with you.\n\n22\n00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.590\nWhat about instant response and\nhandling steps?\n\n23\n00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.310\nWhat about the concept of the CERT,\nthe C, E, R, T, the CSIRT, C, S, I, R,\n\n24\n00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.270\nT, computer security instant response,\ncomputer emergency response.\n\n25\n00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.180\nWe'll define and talk about these terms.\n\n26\n00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.840\nWe're gonna talk about how to handle\nnetwork and security related incidents.\n\n27\n00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.380\nHow to handle malicious code incidents.\n\n28\n00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.610\nWhat happens when somebody\ninfects us with malware?\n\n29\n00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.290\nHow do we address those concerns?\n\n30\n00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.220\nHow do we handle insider threats when\nsomebody that we work with perhaps is\n\n31\n00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.650\nthe threat source, the bad actor, that is\nengaging in activity that leads to risk?\n\n32\n00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.510\nHow do we address that?\n\n33\n00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.690\nHow do we find that out?\n\n34\n00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.320\nCome back and join us, and\nwe'll be talking more about that.\n\n35\n00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.490\nForensic analysis and incident response.\n\n36\n00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.500\nHow do we know, once we find out\nthat there's been an incident and\n\n37\n00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.270\nwe have evidence that points us in that\ndirection, how do we deal with that?\n\n38\n00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.750\nAnd how do we capture that evidence\nin a way that allows us to establish\n\n39\n00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.870\nbeyond reasonable doubt a chain\nof custody of evidence?\n\n40\n00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.550\nAnd the ability to handle that evidence so\nthat if and\n\n41\n00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.050\nwhen it is necessary to show up in a court\nof law and to describe what we found,\n\n42\n00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.710\nand to testify as to the events\nthat occurred, we could do so\n\n43\n00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.170\nauthoritatively and we can stand on\nthe evidence that we have captured and\n\n44\n00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.180\nwe have cataloged,\nwe have reported on, we have analyzed.\n\n45\n00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.370\nBecause we've done so\nin a forensically sound way.\n\n46\n00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.130\nWe'll talk about incident reporting,\nincident recovery.\n\n47\n00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.460\nAnd of course, topic near and\n\n48\n00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.780\ndear to my heart and Cherokee's,\nwe'll be talking about security policy and\n\n49\n00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.800\nlaw and the impact of policy and\nlaw on the incident handling profession.\n\n50\n00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.460\nEncourage you to all come on back,\ntake a look at all that with us.\n\n51\n00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.500\nSpend some time with us.\n\n52\n00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.270\nAnd as always,\nmake sure that you are selective and\n\n53\n00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.910\nwatch what you want to understand and\nfind out about in this series of episodes.\n\n54\n00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.660\nBut keep in mind, there may be a part one,\npart two, part three.\n\n55\n00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.350\nWe often encourage you to watch\nthose episodes in sequential order.\n\n56\n00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.600\nIf you missed something,\ngo back and watch them again.\n\n57\n00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.520\nThat's why we're record them and\n\n58\n00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.860\nwhy you can play them back\nwhenever you wanna look at them.\n\n59\n00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.200\nLooking forward to spending time with you.\n\n60\n00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.400\nAs always, please come on back and see us.\n\n61\n00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.340\nAnd when you do,\nmake sure you bring comfy clothes.\n\n62\n00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.542\nWhat did you say, popcorn?\n\n63\n00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:50.430\n&gt;&gt; Popcorn. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Bring popcorn and\nbring a notepad and make some notes and\n\n64\n00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.050\nwrite down all those\nthings that are important.\n\n65\n00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.694\nAnd make sure that as you're doing so\n\n66\n00:02:53.694 --> 00:02:56.559\nyou thinking about how you're\ngonna prepare for this exam and or\n\n67\n00:02:56.559 --> 00:03:00.061\nthe information necessary to relay this\nto your professional field, and to do\n\n68\n00:03:00.061 --> 00:03:03.669\nthis in the real world as you look to\nbecome more educated, more knowledgeable,\n\n69\n00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:07.097\nand of course, more valuable to your\norganization as an incident handler.\n\n70\n00:03:08.527 --> 00:03:11.798\n[SOUND]\n\n",
