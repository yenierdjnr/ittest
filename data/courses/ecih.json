more about it.\n\n3\n00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.550\nBecause right now,\nAdam Gordon is going to go ahead and\n\n4\n00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.510\nexplain, well,\nwhat to expect within this show series.\n\n5\n00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.140\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n6\n00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.190\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n7\n00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:16.810\nHello, everybody.\n\n8\n00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:17.790\nHopefully everyone's doing well.\n\n9\n00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.690\nLooking forward to spending time with you.\n\n10\n00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.660\nWhen we talk about the EC Council\nCertified Incident Handler material,\n\n11\n00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.810\nwhat we're really focusing on is\nthe understanding of what it means to\n\n12\n00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.520\nbe an incident responder,\nan incident handler, an incident manager.\n\n13\n00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.470\nAs an IT security professional, we're\ngonna be talking about the methodology,\n\n14\n00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.370\nthe techniques,\nthe thought process, the tools and\n\n15\n00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.260\nthe strategies associated\nwith incident handling and\n\n16\n00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.020\nincident response in the enterprise or in\nthe organizations that you all represent.\n\n17\n00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.750\nWe'll be talking about\nthings like risk assessment.\n\n18\n00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.420\nWhy is risk so important?\n\n19\n00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.480\nWhat does risk have to do\nwith incident handling?\n\n20\n00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.330\nWell, come on back and talk to us and\n\n21\n00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.210\nwe'll be happy to talk\nabout that with you.\n\n22\n00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.590\nWhat about instant response and\nhandling steps?\n\n23\n00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.310\nWhat about the concept of the CERT,\nthe C, E, R, T, the CSIRT, C, S, I, R,\n\n24\n00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.270\nT, computer security instant response,\ncomputer emergency response.\n\n25\n00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.180\nWe'll define and talk about these terms.\n\n26\n00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.840\nWe're gonna talk about how to handle\nnetwork and security related incidents.\n\n27\n00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.380\nHow to handle malicious code incidents.\n\n28\n00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.610\nWhat happens when somebody\ninfects us with malware?\n\n29\n00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.290\nHow do we address those concerns?\n\n30\n00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.220\nHow do we handle insider threats when\nsomebody that we work with perhaps is\n\n31\n00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.650\nthe threat source, the bad actor, that is\nengaging in activity that leads to risk?\n\n32\n00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.510\nHow do we address that?\n\n33\n00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.690\nHow do we find that out?\n\n34\n00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.320\nCome back and join us, and\nwe'll be talking more about that.\n\n35\n00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.490\nForensic analysis and incident response.\n\n36\n00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.500\nHow do we know, once we find out\nthat there's been an incident and\n\n37\n00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.270\nwe have evidence that points us in that\ndirection, how do we deal with that?\n\n38\n00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.750\nAnd how do we capture that evidence\nin a way that allows us to establish\n\n39\n00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.870\nbeyond reasonable doubt a chain\nof custody of evidence?\n\n40\n00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.550\nAnd the ability to handle that evidence so\nthat if and\n\n41\n00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.050\nwhen it is necessary to show up in a court\nof law and to describe what we found,\n\n42\n00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.710\nand to testify as to the events\nthat occurred, we could do so\n\n43\n00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.170\nauthoritatively and we can stand on\nthe evidence that we have captured and\n\n44\n00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.180\nwe have cataloged,\nwe have reported on, we have analyzed.\n\n45\n00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.370\nBecause we've done so\nin a forensically sound way.\n\n46\n00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.130\nWe'll talk about incident reporting,\nincident recovery.\n\n47\n00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.460\nAnd of course, topic near and\n\n48\n00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.780\ndear to my heart and Cherokee's,\nwe'll be talking about security policy and\n\n49\n00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.800\nlaw and the impact of policy and\nlaw on the incident handling profession.\n\n50\n00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.460\nEncourage you to all come on back,\ntake a look at all that with us.\n\n51\n00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.500\nSpend some time with us.\n\n52\n00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.270\nAnd as always,\nmake sure that you are selective and\n\n53\n00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.910\nwatch what you want to understand and\nfind out about in this series of episodes.\n\n54\n00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.660\nBut keep in mind, there may be a part one,\npart two, part three.\n\n55\n00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.350\nWe often encourage you to watch\nthose episodes in sequential order.\n\n56\n00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.600\nIf you missed something,\ngo back and watch them again.\n\n57\n00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.520\nThat's why we're record them and\n\n58\n00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.860\nwhy you can play them back\nwhenever you wanna look at them.\n\n59\n00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.200\nLooking forward to spending time with you.\n\n60\n00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.400\nAs always, please come on back and see us.\n\n61\n00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.340\nAnd when you do,\nmake sure you bring comfy clothes.\n\n62\n00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.542\nWhat did you say, popcorn?\n\n63\n00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:50.430\n&gt;&gt; Popcorn. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Bring popcorn and\nbring a notepad and make some notes and\n\n64\n00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.050\nwrite down all those\nthings that are important.\n\n65\n00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.694\nAnd make sure that as you're doing so\n\n66\n00:02:53.694 --> 00:02:56.559\nyou thinking about how you're\ngonna prepare for this exam and or\n\n67\n00:02:56.559 --> 00:03:00.061\nthe information necessary to relay this\nto your professional field, and to do\n\n68\n00:03:00.061 --> 00:03:03.669\nthis in the real world as you look to\nbecome more educated, more knowledgeable,\n\n69\n00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:07.097\nand of course, more valuable to your\norganization as an incident handler.\n\n70\n00:03:08.527 --> 00:03:11.798\n[SOUND]\n\n",

All right, greetings, everyone and\n\n4\n00:00:13.815 --> 00:00:16.720\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.270\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowry and\nin today's episode,\n\n6\n00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.580\nwe are kicking off our new series on\nthe certified incident handler series.\n\n7\n00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.720\nAnd of course joining me in the studio,\nthe man who handles all sorts of\n\n8\n00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.690\nincidents, you know him, you love him,\nhe's our good friend, Mr Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.760\nAdam, welcome back, so\nglad to have you, how's it going?\n\n10\n00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.294\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Thank you very much.\nIt's going well, good to be back, and\n\n11\n00:00:35.294 --> 00:00:39.780\nalways nice to be able to spend sometime\nhere with the lovely people at ITPro TV.\n\n12\n00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.110\nDaniel is not included in that but\neverybody else is included in that.\n\n13\n00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.260\nYou are lovely, I'm only kidding.\n\n14\n00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.111\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n15\n00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:47.867\nwe're gonna talk a little bit\nabout incident handling, and\n\n16\n00:00:47.867 --> 00:00:51.488\nspecifically I thought we would start\nout if that's okay with you, really that\n\n17\n00:00:51.488 --> 00:00:55.217\nkind of chanting, for just a few minutes\nat a high level About what incidents are,\n\n18\n00:00:55.217 --> 00:00:58.550\nwhat the concept of a security\nincident is, where it comes from.\n\n19\n00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.170\nWe have lots of different definitions,\nright, in theory, for what an incident is.\n\n20\n00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.030\nAn incident could be something\nthat has an unknown or\n\n21\n00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.990\nunintended consequence, for instance.\n\n22\n00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.170\nSo if we just think about\nthat as a starting point,\n\n23\n00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.570\nwe can begin to think about\nwhat our definition may be.\n\n24\n00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.200\nSo let me ask you a question Dan.\n\n25\n00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.440\nI know you're always want to help me\nout when we have these conversations.\n\n26\n00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.520\nSo from your experience, and\nyou had a lot of experience in\n\n27\n00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.300\nthese kind of variance given all\nthe work you've done over the years and\n\n28\n00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.890\nyou're like shutting about\nthe various things you've done.\n\n29\n00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.110\nWhat would be a typical security of\nincident that you may have seen or paharbs\n\n30\n00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.370\nhave experienced some of the places\nyou have been and things you've done.\n\n31\n00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.760\n&gt;&gt; A lot of them tend to revolve\naround authorize access of a resource.\n\n32\n00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.400\nPeople like to go sniffing around,\nsee what they can find,\n\n33\n00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.320\nwhat can they get ahold of, and that\nusually trips an alarm for us to go hey,\n\n34\n00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.540\nyou're not supposed to be going there.\n\n35\n00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.510\nSo that's always been a big one.\n\n36\n00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.530\nEven physical access as well,\npeople get snoopy and\n\n37\n00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.420\nthey wanna see what's\nbehind those closed doors.\n\n38\n00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.700\nAll of a sudden you\nfind somebody who's not\n\n39\n00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.290\nauthorized to be in an area of\nthe building that they are currently in.\n\n40\n00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.740\nYou have to let them know,\nokay, you can't go here.\n\n41\n00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.900\nHow did you get through this by the way?\n\n42\n00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.790\nTry to figure out how that went down and\nthen fix the security measures so\n\n43\n00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.720\nthat they can't be repeated.\n\n44\n00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.870\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so essentially either\nsomebody winds up in a place where\n\n45\n00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.630\nthey're not supposed to be\n&gt;&gt; Perhaps on purpose, hopefully not.\n\n46\n00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.810\nHopefully they're not looking\nto do this on purpose.\n\n47\n00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.590\nBut whether they got there on purpose,\n\n48\n00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.970\nor just by accident the door was open,\nmaybe they were curious.\n\n49\n00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.060\nHey, I've always wanted to\nknow what's behind that door.\n\n50\n00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.860\nNever had the opportunity, now it's open,\nlet me go and take a look.\n\n51\n00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.270\nBut somehow, some way, we wind up with\neither a person, or a group of people,\n\n52\n00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.330\nperhaps, engaging activities that\nlead to potential compromise.\n\n53\n00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.600\nMaybe the exposure of information.\n\n54\n00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.640\nPerhaps the exposure of\nsome confidentiality and/or\n\n55\n00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.270\na breach of integrity along the way,\nand we'll talk about those terms and\n\n56\n00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.530\nwhat they are as we get into\nour conversations here.\n\n57\n00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.500\nBut, if we start with a base line of an\nincident being an event of some kind that\n\n58\n00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.640\nleads to an unwanted, un-looked for,\nundesired outcome, and we add in computer\n\n59\n00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.350\nand security to that mix, and we think\nabout computer security incidents being\n\n60\n00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.730\nincidents that lead to unwanted outcomes,\nbut have negative consequences.\n\n61\n00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.960\nAnd usually from our perspective,\n\n62\n00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.470\nare gonna happen because of somebody\nviolating security controls.\n\n63\n00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.880\nWe begin to be able to think\nabout the broad expanse.\n\n64\n00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.800\nThe broad thought process of what\nwe may be looking to engage.\n\n65\n00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.700\nAnd as potentially incident handlers,\nand as people,\n\n66\n00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.250\nsecurity professionals, IT professionals,\n\n67\n00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.800\nthat are looking ultimately to figure\nout how to deal with these issues.\n\n68\n00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.310\nWe have to constantly be\nthinking about is that activity?\n\n69\n00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.630\nIs that thought process?\n\n70\n00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.260\nIs that activity that somebody's engaging\nin, authorized or not, as Daniel said?\n\n71\n00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.010\nWere they able to walk into this area\nwithout credentials and if so, why?\n\n72\n00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.549\nAnd one of the most important things\nwe have to think about when it comes to\n\n73\n00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.580\nincident handling is this idea\nof can we get to the root cause?\n\n74\n00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.540\nWe're going to keep\ncoming back to this and\n\n75\n00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.980\nthinking about this from a lot\nof different perspectives.\n\n76\n00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.780\nWe'll talk a little bit later on in some\nof our other discussions about risk and\n\n77\n00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.870\nthe impact of risk and why it's so\n\n78\n00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.160\nimportant to understand how to\nnot only qualify and quantify.\n\n79\n00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.460\nMeasure risk, but also understand what's\nat the heart of the risk behavior that\n\n80\n00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.580\nwe're seeing, engaging in some cases,\nor at least trying to avoid in others.\n\n81\n00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.310\nAnd so root cause, root cause analysis\nbecomes very, very important as well.\n\n82\n00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.370\nAnd we have to be thinking,\nabout how we get to root cause.\n\n83\n00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.680\nHow do we understand the events that led\nthat person to be in that hallway or\n\n84\n00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.240\nin that room or whatever it is, whatever\nthe situation is that we're talking about,\n\n85\n00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.260\nthe one Daniel described as one of many.\n\n86\n00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.380\nHow did I sit down at my computer,\nopen up a share or\n\n87\n00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.480\nan access to a share that I\nwasn't supposed to see and\n\n88\n00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.930\nlook at a spreadsheet that has\nconfidential contact information?\n\n89\n00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.990\nI have these conversations\nwith customers all the time.\n\n90\n00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.730\nI spend a lot of time in the field\nauditing work or doing audit work for\n\n91\n00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:45.480\ncustomers.\n\n92\n00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.180\nI spend a lot of time configuring\nmanaging, setting up and\n\n93\n00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.420\nbuilding infrastructure for\ncustomers, and I spend a lot of time\n\n94\n00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.570\nhelping them to understand how to do those\nthings in a secure and thoughtful way.\n\n95\n00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.110\nAnd when breaches occur, and they will\noccur, it's only a matter of time,\n\n96\n00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.390\nwe have to be thinking about what\ncould we have done differently.\n\n97\n00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.970\nBut not because we wanna assess and\nlay blame at the feet of somebody.\n\n98\n00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.140\nThis is often one of the things\nyou have to coach, or\n\n99\n00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.080\nwork people through,\nwhen we do this kind of work,\n\n100\n00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.830\nand we show up after the fact,\nand we then respond to incidents.\n\n101\n00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.677\nIncident handling is about understanding\nand documenting, and detailing, and\n\n102\n00:05:18.677 --> 00:05:22.132\nultimately telling the story of what\nwent on, what led us from hey this was\n\n103\n00:05:22.132 --> 00:05:24.861\na wonderful day,\nlook at how cool things are going to wow,\n\n104\n00:05:24.861 --> 00:05:27.007\ncouldn't have gotten\nany worse if we tried.\n\n105\n00:05:27.007 --> 00:05:30.913\nAnd how do we walk through the story that\ntakes us from Point A to Point B, and\n\n106\n00:05:30.913 --> 00:05:34.943\nwhat were the key milestones, the touch\npoints on the way, that occurred and\n\n107\n00:05:34.943 --> 00:05:37.733\ninstead of going the right way,\nwent the wrong way and\n\n108\n00:05:37.733 --> 00:05:41.910\ncompounded themselves over time into\nactivities that led to compromise.\n\n109\n00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.260\nWe have to tell that story,\ntell it authoritatively.\n\n110\n00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.880\nNot be scared and\nnot be afraid to describe it.\n\n111\n00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.920\nBut we also have to understand that\nit's not about laying blame at\n\n112\n00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.770\nthe feet of the person or the entity or\n\n113\n00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.310\nthe combination of those things that led\nto the compromise first and foremost.\n\n114\n00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.520\nIt may very well be at\nsome point about blame.\n\n115\n00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.390\nThere may be culpability,\nthere may be blame to go around\n\n116\n00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.410\nPeople may have acted incorrectly,\nhopefully, not on purpose.\n\n117\n00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:09.460\nBut even accidentally, we still may\nneed to ascribe blame to them and\n\n118\n00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:10.260\nhold them accountable and\n\n119\n00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.760\nresponsible so we could figure out\nwhat to do differently the next time.\n\n120\n00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.420\nBut whether that's the ultimate outcome or\n\n121\n00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.470\nnot, it's our job as first responders\nultimately as incident responders.\n\n122\n00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.690\nTo be able to tell\nthe story authoritatively.\n\n123\n00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.090\nAnd to tell it from the perspective\nof understanding and\n\n124\n00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:29.370\nuncovering as much information as we can\nto validate that the story is legitimate.\n\n125\n00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.960\nWe're not looking, in other words\nfirst and foremost, to say aha, right?\n\n126\n00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.260\nThat aha moment that you hear about and\nwe see in all these detective movies.\n\n127\n00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.100\nIt was so and so, right,\ndoing this this way.\n\n128\n00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.960\nYeah, that's important.\n\n129\n00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.049\nWe wanna be able to get there.\n\n130\n00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.490\nBut I will often tell customers\nwhen I do this kind of work for\n\n131\n00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.150\nthem, it's as much about being able\nto understand the mechanics and\n\n132\n00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:52.880\nthe methodical steps that took place to\nget us here as it is about understanding\n\n133\n00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.570\nthe who, as opposed to simply the what,\nthe when, the where.\n\n134\n00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:57.490\nAnd we've got to combine\nthose things together.\n\n135\n00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.780\nSo as we begin our conversations, I want\nto make sure you're comfortable with this\n\n136\n00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.840\nidea because what we don't want you to\nthink about incident handling Is that is\n\n137\n00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:09.060\nultimately just simply pointing the finger\nat somebody because while that's important\n\n138\n00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.450\nthat's not gonna solve the problem that\nultimately led to the breach in the first\n\n139\n00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.260\nplace and while that particular activity,\nthat behavior and\n\n140\n00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.830\nthat person may not repeat because\nyou've taken steps to prevent it.\n\n141\n00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:23.220\nIf we don't truly understand what led\nto the breach, the weaknesses that\n\n142\n00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:27.380\nwe call vulnerability, and the threats,\nthe potential to do harm and\n\n143\n00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.900\nthe risk, the aggregation of those things,\nand the likelihood that they will occur\n\n144\n00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.930\nare still there in the system\nin one way or another, right?\n\n145\n00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.440\nAnd they're not going to easily disappear.\n\n146\n00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.920\nThey're not going to be remediated or\n\n147\n00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.850\nmitigated in any way unless we take steps\nto better fully understand those things.\n\n148\n00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:44.810\nAnd so we have to really be\nwilling to tell those stories and\n\n149\n00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:48.030\nunderstand a little bit about that\nas part of what we're talking about.\n\n150\n00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.280\nSo, keep that in mind as\nwe begin our conversation.\n\n151\n00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.720\nI think it's very important for\nus to be thinking about those things.\n\n152\n00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:55.744\nWhat about assets, right?\n\n153\n00:07:55.744 --> 00:07:58.454\nWe often talk about assets\nof being the focal point in\n\n154\n00:07:58.454 --> 00:08:01.301\ninformation security\nmanagement of our activities.\n\n155\n00:08:01.301 --> 00:08:03.370\nWe build and talk about building.\n\n156\n00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:08.198\nDefense-in-Depth architecture's multiple\noverlapping layers of controls that help\n\n157\n00:08:08.198 --> 00:08:12.451\nus to reinforce what we're doing and\nto ensure that if one thing, one control,\n\n158\n00:08:12.451 --> 00:08:17.024\none countermeasure were to be breached or\nsomehow nullified, that others would be in\n\n159\n00:08:17.024 --> 00:08:21.490\nplace in order to essentially absorb that\nattack and prevent that from occurring.\n\n160\n00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:24.982\nSo when we build out our\nDefense-in-Depth architecture,\n\n161\n00:08:24.982 --> 00:08:29.438\nwe have to be thinking about redundancy\nand reliability in depth of control.\n\n162\n00:08:29.438 --> 00:08:32.157\nSo that's gonna be important, but\nwe also have to be thinking about,\n\n163\n00:08:32.157 --> 00:08:33.550\nwhat is it that we're protecting?\n\n164\n00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:34.465\nWhat is an asset?\n\n165\n00:08:34.465 --> 00:08:35.755\nHow do we define that?\n\n166\n00:08:35.755 --> 00:08:38.146\nIs it the information in the spreadsheet?\n\n167\n00:08:38.146 --> 00:08:42.861\nIs it the knowledge of what the IP\naddress range is for our network?\n\n168\n00:08:42.861 --> 00:08:46.122\nIs it the ability to be able to\nunderstand who an authorized user is?\n\n169\n00:08:46.122 --> 00:08:48.794\nAny of all these things\nare pieces of information.\n\n170\n00:08:48.794 --> 00:08:51.099\nAll of them potentially\nare assets to an attacker,\n\n171\n00:08:51.099 --> 00:08:53.617\ndepending on what it is they're\nlooking to do, and what\n\n172\n00:08:53.617 --> 00:08:57.172\nthe ultimate outcome is of the activities\nthat they're looking to engage in.\n\n173\n00:08:57.172 --> 00:09:00.960\nIn other words, assets have to be\ndefined broadly in the beginning\n\n174\n00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.630\nof our conversations to better understand\nhow we then narrowly focus, tailor and\n\n175\n00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:09.553\nscope our activities to focus in on or\nessentially be able to apply our\n\n176\n00:09:09.553 --> 00:09:13.749\ncountermeasures in a meaningful way\nto those assets that have meaning and\n\n177\n00:09:13.749 --> 00:09:16.961\nare important and\nneed to be protected by the business.\n\n178\n00:09:16.961 --> 00:09:20.300\nSo really, the question we would often\nstart out with to think about is,\n\n179\n00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.185\nis every piece of information an asset?\n\n180\n00:09:22.185 --> 00:09:26.287\nBecause you could ask this two ways, is\nevery asset that we have worth protecting\n\n181\n00:09:26.287 --> 00:09:29.142\nor is everything that we have\na valuable asset, right?\n\n182\n00:09:29.142 --> 00:09:31.014\nIn other words,\nif you think about that and\n\n183\n00:09:31.014 --> 00:09:34.663\nthen if you could also look at this from\nthe perspective of what are assets, right?\n\n184\n00:09:34.663 --> 00:09:37.046\nBecause not everything\nis worth protecting, but\n\n185\n00:09:37.046 --> 00:09:39.551\neverything in theory can\nbe classified as an asset.\n\n186\n00:09:39.551 --> 00:09:42.040\nThe chair, and\nthe fans sitting across from us,\n\n187\n00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.016\nright here in the studio as\nwe're talking are assets, but\n\n188\n00:09:45.016 --> 00:09:48.922\nthey may not be as worthy of protection\nas information stored on a computer.\n\n189\n00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:50.316\nInformation is an asset.\n\n190\n00:09:50.316 --> 00:09:51.995\nPeople are assets.\n\n191\n00:09:51.995 --> 00:09:56.222\nThe information that is available to\nothers through interaction with them is\n\n192\n00:09:56.222 --> 00:09:56.813\nan asset.\n\n193\n00:09:56.813 --> 00:09:58.310\nBut there are also hard assets, right?\n\n194\n00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:03.565\nComputers and a variety of other assets\nthat may or may not be important to us.\n\n195\n00:10:03.565 --> 00:10:06.505\nSo we all have to think about\nwhat is not just an asset, but\n\n196\n00:10:06.505 --> 00:10:08.908\nwhat is important to\nthe business as an asset.\n\n197\n00:10:08.908 --> 00:10:11.776\nHow do we define those things,\nreally then becomes the focal point for\n\n198\n00:10:11.776 --> 00:10:12.951\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n199\n00:10:12.951 --> 00:10:13.945\nSo, yeah, go ahead.\n\n200\n00:10:13.945 --> 00:10:17.401\n&gt;&gt; I would just say, and this really\nbrings up a great point when you start\n\n201\n00:10:17.401 --> 00:10:19.451\ntalking about what is and is not an asset,\n\n202\n00:10:19.451 --> 00:10:23.220\nespecially when it comes to digital\nassets, things that are on a computer.\n\n203\n00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:28.193\nJust because it's on my server doesn't\nnecessarily mean that it is something that\n\n204\n00:10:28.193 --> 00:10:30.618\nis extremely valuable with my company.\n\n205\n00:10:30.618 --> 00:10:32.102\nI might be the CEO of the company.\n\n206\n00:10:32.102 --> 00:10:35.374\nI put Aunt Polly's apple pie\nrecipe in the network share.\n\n207\n00:10:35.374 --> 00:10:36.491\nIt's getting backed up every night.\n\n208\n00:10:36.491 --> 00:10:39.155\nIt's getting a little security\nit probably doesn't need, but\n\n209\n00:10:39.155 --> 00:10:41.484\nif I lose it we're not talking\nabout the end of the game.\n\n210\n00:10:41.484 --> 00:10:44.838\nIf we're talking about Aunt Polly's\napple recipe, and we make apple pie for\n\n211\n00:10:44.838 --> 00:10:46.799\na living, and\nthat's the recipe we use, and\n\n212\n00:10:46.799 --> 00:10:50.481\nall of a sudden it's being disseminated,\nnow we've got ourselves a real problem.\n\n213\n00:10:50.481 --> 00:10:51.793\n&gt;&gt; Potentially, right?\n\n214\n00:10:51.793 --> 00:10:53.385\nAnd of course,\nwe don't wanna piss off Aunt Polly.\n\n215\n00:10:53.385 --> 00:10:53.885\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; She's a nice woman.\n\n216\n00:10:53.885 --> 00:10:54.491\n&gt;&gt; She's very nice.\n\n217\n00:10:54.491 --> 00:10:55.377\n&gt;&gt; Very nice, let's be clear about\n\n218\n00:10:55.377 --> 00:10:55.972\nthat.\n&gt;&gt; She will kill\n\n219\n00:10:55.972 --> 00:10:56.551\nyou.\n[LAUGH]\n\n220\n00:10:56.551 --> 00:10:57.643\n&gt;&gt; And she makes good apple pies, so\n\n221\n00:10:57.643 --> 00:10:59.047\nwe wanna make sure we\nstay on her good side,\n\n222\n00:10:59.047 --> 00:10:59.759\nright?\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n223\n00:10:59.759 --> 00:11:02.165\n&gt;&gt; But we do wanna make sure we understand\n\n224\n00:11:02.165 --> 00:11:05.784\nthat there are assets and\nthen there are assets, right?\n\n225\n00:11:05.784 --> 00:11:08.592\nAnd Daniel's point is essentially a great\n\n226\n00:11:08.592 --> 00:11:12.066\none for two reasons.\nNumber one, he focuses our attention\n\n227\n00:11:12.066 --> 00:11:16.587\non the fact that as I was suggesting, not\nevery asset is important to the business,\n\n228\n00:11:16.587 --> 00:11:20.427\nalthough many things are assets.\nAnd those that are important to the\n\n229\n00:11:20.427 --> 00:11:25.223\nbusiness have to have or will have varying\nlevels of importance, which means that we\n\n230\n00:11:25.223 --> 00:11:29.672\nmay protect some more than others, right?\nAnd to your point, you have the recipe for\n\n231\n00:11:29.672 --> 00:11:33.207\napple pie being on the system and\nbeing backed up and afforded, as you said,\n\n232\n00:11:33.207 --> 00:11:36.139\na certain level of protection, right?\nIt's backed up.\n\n233\n00:11:36.139 --> 00:11:37.363\nThere is redundancy.\n\n234\n00:11:37.363 --> 00:11:38.836\nWe could probably restore it if necessary.\n\n235\n00:11:38.836 --> 00:11:40.620\nThere may be access control associated\n\n236\n00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.385\nwith it, even though we may or\nmay not be worried about that.\n\n237\n00:11:43.385 --> 00:11:45.422\nSo there are levels of protection, but\n\n238\n00:11:45.422 --> 00:11:47.891\nwe're not putting it in\nthe vault under lock and\n\n239\n00:11:47.891 --> 00:11:52.153\nkey behind two defensive perimeters with\narmed guards, barbed wire and whatever\n\n240\n00:11:52.153 --> 00:11:56.644\nother protections we may put in place.\nBecause it may not be as critical as\n\n241\n00:11:56.644 --> 00:11:59.164\nthe secret recipe for Coca-Cola or\n\n242\n00:11:59.164 --> 00:12:04.624\nwhatever a super-duper secret item maybe\nthat we would throw in the vault and\n\n243\n00:12:04.624 --> 00:12:06.287\nprotect, right?\nAnd so\n\n244\n00:12:06.287 --> 00:12:08.946\nwe wanna understand that\nasset classification and\n\n245\n00:12:08.946 --> 00:12:13.149\nunderstanding the definition of what\nequals an asset worthy of protection, and\n\n246\n00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:16.667\nat what level that asset must be\nprotected, is part of what we have to\n\n247\n00:12:16.667 --> 00:12:19.996\nunderstand as incident handlers.\nBecause once we show up and\n\n248\n00:12:19.996 --> 00:12:21.898\nstart responding to an incident,\n\n249\n00:12:21.898 --> 00:12:25.899\ndepending on what that incident has\nessentially laid out in front of us,\n\n250\n00:12:25.899 --> 00:12:30.592\nwhat the things are that have happened?\nWhat systems or what system if there's\n\n251\n00:12:30.592 --> 00:12:34.539\nonly one, have been targeted?\nWhat may or may not have been taken away?\n\n252\n00:12:34.539 --> 00:12:36.178\nWhat may or may not have been compromised?\n\n253\n00:12:36.178 --> 00:12:38.151\nWhat may or may not have been modified?\n\n254\n00:12:38.151 --> 00:12:40.272\nThese are questions we have to understand\n\n255\n00:12:40.272 --> 00:12:41.246\nvery quickly.\nBut\n\n256\n00:12:41.246 --> 00:12:44.528\nwe then have to weigh the answers\nto those questions against what\n\n257\n00:12:44.528 --> 00:12:46.788\nthe asset inventory of the business is.\nAnd\n\n258\n00:12:46.788 --> 00:12:50.867\nif we find out as you said that a bunch of\ninformation may have been compromised, but\n\n259\n00:12:50.867 --> 00:12:54.381\nit was information that really had no\nvalue to speak of to the business.\n\n260\n00:12:54.381 --> 00:12:56.278\nThen while this incident is important for\n\n261\n00:12:56.278 --> 00:12:58.659\nus to take note of,\nwhile we do have to be aware of it,\n\n262\n00:12:58.659 --> 00:13:01.855\nwhile we do have to respond to it and\nwalk through our methodology, and\n\n263\n00:13:01.855 --> 00:13:04.400\nwe'll go through what all\nthose things are in due time,\n\n264\n00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.616\nwe may not then take any action.\nWe just may simply file a report and say,\n\n265\n00:13:07.616 --> 00:13:11.098\nhey, guess what?\nThis happened, we need to be aware of it.\n\n266\n00:13:11.098 --> 00:13:12.541\nWe should take steps at some point in\n\n267\n00:13:12.541 --> 00:13:15.874\nthe future, so that this doesn't happen\nto other really valuable information.\n\n268\n00:13:15.874 --> 00:13:17.863\nBut no outcome at this point in time is\n\n269\n00:13:17.863 --> 00:13:21.302\nwarranted other than simply awareness.\nAnd that may very well be\n\n270\n00:13:21.302 --> 00:13:24.811\nthe outcome we look for.\nBut if it's information as assets are,\n\n271\n00:13:24.811 --> 00:13:29.399\nthat has critical value to the company, we\nnow all of a sudden have a very different\n\n272\n00:13:29.399 --> 00:13:32.443\nset of activities.\nBecause we have to do everything we just\n\n273\n00:13:32.443 --> 00:13:35.833\ndescribed, but now we also have to\ntake not only remediative action,\n\n274\n00:13:35.833 --> 00:13:39.396\nbut we probably have to wind up at some\npoint filing a report that may lead to\n\n275\n00:13:39.396 --> 00:13:41.658\na court case.\nAnd we may wind up testifying or\n\n276\n00:13:41.658 --> 00:13:45.276\nat least telling our story in front\nof people that can then take action,\n\n277\n00:13:45.276 --> 00:13:47.112\ndepending on what we're doing.\nSo\n\n278\n00:13:47.112 --> 00:13:48.926\nthis becomes very important.\nSo\n\n279\n00:13:48.926 --> 00:13:53.373\nhow we classify assets is one of the most\nimportant things we have to think about.\n\n280\n00:13:53.373 --> 00:13:54.854\nBut there's a disconnect here and\n\n281\n00:13:54.854 --> 00:13:57.337\nthis is the dichotomy.\nThis is the break that we often have\n\n282\n00:13:57.337 --> 00:13:59.875\nto think about.\nBecause the incident handlers are often\n\n283\n00:13:59.875 --> 00:14:02.841\nnot the same people that do ask\na classification in the business.\n\n284\n00:14:02.841 --> 00:14:04.283\nAs a matter of fact, it's very\n\n285\n00:14:04.283 --> 00:14:08.224\nrare that as an incident handler, an IT\nprofessional, security professional that\n\n286\n00:14:08.224 --> 00:14:12.507\nis gonna be involved in incident handling.\nIn a small to medium-sized network,\n\n287\n00:14:12.507 --> 00:14:15.831\nwhere you may have a small team,\na group or an army of one or\n\n288\n00:14:15.831 --> 00:14:19.920\ntwo or three people, and everybody\ndoes a lot of very similar things,\n\n289\n00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.844\nyou may fill many roles, wear many hats.\nYou may be an incident responder.\n\n290\n00:14:23.844 --> 00:14:26.462\nYou may be an IT admin professional.\n\n291\n00:14:26.462 --> 00:14:27.990\nYou may be a security professional.\n\n292\n00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:30.201\nAnd if you are doing all those things at\n\n293\n00:14:30.201 --> 00:14:34.698\nonce, then you very well may play a part\nin not only doing incident handling,\n\n294\n00:14:34.698 --> 00:14:38.155\nbut also asset classification.\nSo you may very well find yourself\n\n295\n00:14:38.155 --> 00:14:41.281\nsitting in both camps.\nBut in larger businesses, very,\n\n296\n00:14:41.281 --> 00:14:46.224\nvery geographically distributed networks\nwhere you have thousands of users, and\n\n297\n00:14:46.224 --> 00:14:50.107\nyou have tens or perhaps hundreds\nof IT professionals globally,\n\n298\n00:14:50.107 --> 00:14:53.330\nyou're gonna have specialization.\nAnd as a result,\n\n299\n00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:56.850\nyou very well may be on a team\nthat does incident response, but\n\n300\n00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:01.796\nthat team may not have responsibility for\nasset classification, asset management,\n\n301\n00:15:01.796 --> 00:15:05.702\nasset identification.\nAnd as a result, you may not know anything\n\n302\n00:15:05.702 --> 00:15:10.284\nabout what those assets are before you\nshow up and actually decide to engage in\n\n303\n00:15:10.284 --> 00:15:14.425\nyour activity, which is incident handling.\nLet's figure out what went on.\n\n304\n00:15:14.425 --> 00:15:16.493\nSo telling that story maybe difficult\n\n305\n00:15:16.493 --> 00:15:20.121\nbecause you may not have direct\nknowledge of what the assets were.\n\n306\n00:15:20.121 --> 00:15:22.332\nAnd my point is you're gonna have to\n\n307\n00:15:22.332 --> 00:15:25.795\npartner with other people to be a good,\na successful and\n\n308\n00:15:25.795 --> 00:15:29.682\na thorough incident handler.\nAnd this generically the same way we\n\n309\n00:15:29.682 --> 00:15:33.412\nwould talk about doing anything\nwith regards to IT and or security.\n\n310\n00:15:33.412 --> 00:15:35.810\nYou're gonna have to form partnerships and\n\n311\n00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:40.017\nrely on people that may be doing other\nthings, so that they can help you and you\n\n312\n00:15:40.017 --> 00:15:43.897\ncan help them to be better at your jobs.\nAnd if you´re not able to form those\n\n313\n00:15:43.897 --> 00:15:47.268\nalliances, form those partnerships,\ninteract with those people,\n\n314\n00:15:47.268 --> 00:15:49.945\nit's very hard to do our job.\nBecause without a full and\n\n315\n00:15:49.945 --> 00:15:53.988\ncomplete understanding of the picture that\nwe are trying to put together, the jigsaw\n\n316\n00:15:53.988 --> 00:15:57.443\npuzzle winds up being incomplete.\nAnd I don´t know about you, but\n\n317\n00:15:57.443 --> 00:16:00.823\nI could tell you from first-hand\nexperience that although,\n\n318\n00:16:00.823 --> 00:16:05.178\nI'm somebody who can certainly extrapolate\nand aggregate a lot of data and make\n\n319\n00:16:05.178 --> 00:16:09.406\nconclusions based on what I see I don't\nlike to make guesses if I can avoid it.\n\n320\n00:16:09.406 --> 00:16:11.511\nI would much rather make decisions and\n\n321\n00:16:11.511 --> 00:16:14.820\nreport out on facts that I\nhave first hand knowledge of.\n\n322\n00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:18.750\nAnd that I figured out authoritatively\nare legitimately representing\n\n323\n00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:20.610\nthe situation we find ourselves in.\n\n324\n00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:24.250\nIn other words, I don't like to fill in\nthe blanks, if possible, with guess work.\n\n325\n00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:28.210\nIn the field I would much prefer to fill\nin the blanks with as much valid and\n\n326\n00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:30.750\nvalidated knowledge that I can.\n\n327\n00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:34.667\nSo as a result, I really do look to those\npeople in those situations that can help\n\n328\n00:16:34.667 --> 00:16:37.850\nme to better understand\nthe environment that I'm in.\n\n329\n00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:42.432\nI get called in a lot as an external\nconsultant/professional, if you will,\n\n330\n00:16:42.432 --> 00:16:44.839\nto do this work for customers on demand.\n\n331\n00:16:44.839 --> 00:16:47.190\nBecause they may not have\nthese skills on staff.\n\n332\n00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:49.860\nAnd as a result,\nI may be working in environments,\n\n333\n00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:53.000\nI often am working in environments,\nthat are strange and\n\n334\n00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.870\nunknown because I'm not a day to\nday member of that admin function.\n\n335\n00:16:56.870 --> 00:17:00.841\nI don't operate on those networks on\na regular basis and as a result of that,\n\n336\n00:17:00.841 --> 00:17:04.763\nI have to rely on those around me in\norder to provide that guidance, right?\n\n337\n00:17:04.763 --> 00:17:06.090\nIt's very important.\n\n338\n00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:09.850\nAnd so really, to be a successful incident\nhandler, you have know a lot of things,\n\n339\n00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:11.555\ndo a lot of things, have skills.\n\n340\n00:17:11.555 --> 00:17:12.350\nThere's no doubt about that.\n\n341\n00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:15.160\nDon't wanna minimize\nthe level of proficiency and\n\n342\n00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.780\ntechnical prowess that\ngoes into doing this.\n\n343\n00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:21.910\nBut you also have to be able to and\nwilling to form those alliances and\n\n344\n00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:23.910\nengage in those dialogues\nwith other people.\n\n345\n00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:27.390\nYou'd be surprised how far a good\ncup of coffee and a smile and\n\n346\n00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:29.970\na goodwill gesture gets\nyou in this business.\n\n347\n00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:33.960\nBecause people will be willing, for the\nmost part, to sit and talk with you and\n\n348\n00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.120\nhelp you to understand what\nyou need to accomplish.\n\n349\n00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.733\nIf you're willing to spend\nthe time to get to know them and\n\n350\n00:17:38.733 --> 00:17:40.647\nshow them the courtesy that they are due.\n\n351\n00:17:40.647 --> 00:17:43.262\nAnd it's an important lesson for\nall of us starting out,\n\n352\n00:17:43.262 --> 00:17:45.420\nregardless of where we are in our career.\n\n353\n00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.870\nTo remember that it's\nalways important to ask for\n\n354\n00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:50.930\nhelp from others when we need it\nbecause we don't know everything.\n\n355\n00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:55.070\nThere's never a day that goes by, in what\nI do professionally, in what I do in\n\n356\n00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:59.110\nterms of learning and teaching,\nall the activities that I'm engaged in.\n\n357\n00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:01.889\nThere's never a day that goes\nby that isn't, in my mind,\n\n358\n00:18:01.889 --> 00:18:05.200\na successful day if I haven't\nlearned something new, right?\n\n359\n00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:08.020\nSo I have to constantly be out there\nlearning things, interacting with people,\n\n360\n00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:11.330\nunderstanding better my environment and\nthe environments of the clients and\n\n361\n00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:12.750\nthe customers that I support.\n\n362\n00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:15.426\nOr I'm not doing my job as an IT\nprofessional, as a security professional.\n\n363\n00:18:15.426 --> 00:18:18.106\nSo it's very important for\nus to think about that.\n\n364\n00:18:18.106 --> 00:18:19.630\nWhen we've figured out assets and\n\n365\n00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:22.680\nhow to define them, we then have\nto focus on the next level down.\n\n366\n00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.862\nAnd the next level down is\ndata classification, right?\n\n367\n00:18:25.862 --> 00:18:29.353\nOr classification of assets,\nbut mainly data classification.\n\n368\n00:18:29.353 --> 00:18:33.628\nWe've already talked about asset\nclassification in our discussion to this\n\n369\n00:18:33.628 --> 00:18:36.660\npoint but\ndata as a very specific kind of asset.\n\n370\n00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:40.710\nAnd make no mistake,\npeople are assets, data is an asset or\n\n371\n00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:44.950\ncan be considered assets, if we're tied on\nmultiple sets from multiple types of data,\n\n372\n00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:47.230\nas Daniel indicated in\nhis comments before.\n\n373\n00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:49.554\nAnything can be an asset but\nwhen we classify,\n\n374\n00:18:49.554 --> 00:18:53.503\nwe're really thinking about classifying\ndata in particular in this regard.\n\n375\n00:18:53.503 --> 00:18:55.343\nAnd when we classify data,\n\n376\n00:18:55.343 --> 00:19:01.023\nwhile there are many schemes that we can\nuse to classify data, secret, top secret,\n\n377\n00:19:01.023 --> 00:19:06.320\neyes only, for official use only,\npublic, private, high, medium, low.\n\n378\n00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.790\nI mean, the list is almost endless,\nand the varieties and\n\n379\n00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:11.810\nthe combinations and\nrecombinations of those schemes\n\n380\n00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:16.740\nis really up to the individuals that are\nmanaging those systems as data custodians.\n\n381\n00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:19.650\nAnd the creators of the data,\nthe data owners.\n\n382\n00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:22.610\nAnd it's up to them to\ndecide what that system or\n\n383\n00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:24.595\nthat classification scheme will look like.\n\n384\n00:19:24.595 --> 00:19:27.710\nThere's no right and wrong, in other\nwords, is what I'm suggesting to you here.\n\n385\n00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:30.190\nI may have shared with you in\none of our prior discussions,\n\n386\n00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:31.910\nDaniel's certainly heard\nme talk about this before.\n\n387\n00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:34.700\nSome of the work I do in\nthe government and the military\n\n388\n00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:38.930\naround the world leads to some interesting\nconversations about data classifications.\n\n389\n00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:39.930\nThere are many,\n\n390\n00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:44.000\nmany different schemes beyond the ones you\nsee on TV or heard about in movies that\n\n391\n00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.860\nyou may not be aware of unless\nyou actually work in these areas.\n\n392\n00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.510\nI think I'll share with\nyou the one from NATO,\n\n393\n00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:54.578\nthey have a classification called cosmic,\nthat is above top secret, above official.\n\n394\n00:19:54.578 --> 00:19:59.220\nYeah, they have all these interesting and\nreally just kind of specific to industry,\n\n395\n00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:02.310\nspecific to vertical kind of designations.\n\n396\n00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:04.810\nAnd so\nthere's really no one way to do this.\n\n397\n00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:07.615\nWhat you have to take away from\nthis as a message, is not hey,\n\n398\n00:20:07.615 --> 00:20:09.652\nit's gonna be this particular way or else.\n\n399\n00:20:09.652 --> 00:20:13.415\nBut rather, regardless of\nthe classification scheme we use,\n\n400\n00:20:13.415 --> 00:20:15.450\nit has to be well documented.\n\n401\n00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:19.971\nHas to be officially communicated from the\ntop down in terms of a policy, a process,\n\n402\n00:20:19.971 --> 00:20:23.425\nand a procedure that pushes out and\nstandardizes how we do this.\n\n403\n00:20:23.425 --> 00:20:26.720\nMust be implemented relentlessly\nacross the board and standardized.\n\n404\n00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:27.990\nEverybody must follow it.\n\n405\n00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:32.170\nAnd it has to be auditable and\nit has to be verifiable, right?\n\n406\n00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:34.580\nWe have to be able to randomly sample and\n\n407\n00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:36.980\nmake sure that all data is\nclassified the right way.\n\n408\n00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:40.070\nAnd we have to be able to verify that\nwith an audit trail that that data\n\n409\n00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:42.280\nis indeed being classified and\nused that way.\n\n410\n00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:45.260\nIf we can't do these things,\nclassification's meaningless.\n\n411\n00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:48.840\nI can say data's top secret but\nif I don't have the countermeasures and\n\n412\n00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:53.340\ncontrols in place to support that, I don't\nhave the system defined to support that.\n\n413\n00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:56.040\nI don't have the policies\nin place to enforce that.\n\n414\n00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:59.430\nAnd I don't have the ability to audit\nthat, then all it is is a word.\n\n415\n00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:00.860\nTwo words actually, top secret, right?\n\n416\n00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:03.930\nThat's all it is and, as a result,\nit's really nothing of any value.\n\n417\n00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:04.898\nThere's no significance,\n\n418\n00:21:04.898 --> 00:21:08.045\nno reliability there, right [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; It loses all its meaning because you\n\n419\n00:21:08.045 --> 00:21:11.998\ndon't have that whole system put in place\nto keep that top secret thing actually\n\n420\n00:21:11.998 --> 00:21:12.651\ntop secret.\n\n421\n00:21:12.651 --> 00:21:14.240\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely correct and,\nas a matter of fact,\n\n422\n00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.640\nit actually starts out with no meaning.\n\n423\n00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.090\nRight, because if you think about it,\nthere's no way to enforce and\n\n424\n00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:18.795\nimplement that.\n\n425\n00:21:18.795 --> 00:21:21.310\nSo we're paying lip service to it.\n\n426\n00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:22.420\nThis is what we would say, right?\n\n427\n00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:26.370\nAnd while it sounds impressive, there's\nnothing to back it up to your point, and\n\n428\n00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:28.020\nit's a hollow kind of system really.\n\n429\n00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:29.280\nIt has no substance, right?\n\n430\n00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.200\nSo that's gonna be an issue.\n\n431\n00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:34.000\nNow having said that, right,\nwe can classify data, as I said,\n\n432\n00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:34.860\nin many different ways.\n\n433\n00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:40.070\nBut traditionally what you will often\nsee is something like, top secret,\n\n434\n00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:44.590\nsome sort of high, medium, low, top\nsecret, secret, official, whatever it is.\n\n435\n00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:47.790\nI ran through several of\nthem just now with you.\n\n436\n00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:51.470\nBut as I said, keep in mind, while\nthere's no specific do it this way or\n\n437\n00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:52.920\nelse kinda format.\n\n438\n00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.890\nThe idea's that whatever you use,\n\n439\n00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:59.950\nthere must be a define system that's\nbroadly communicated, widely available and\n\n440\n00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:01.890\nimplemented, and\nstandardized across the board.\n\n441\n00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:03.877\nRegardless of what it may be,\n\n442\n00:22:03.877 --> 00:22:09.370\nthere should be some sort of distinction\nbetween secret and publicly available.\n\n443\n00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:13.078\nMeaning, whatever's kept confidential,\nwhatever will be available to anybody,\n\n444\n00:22:13.078 --> 00:22:16.796\nthere's probably some sort of in between\nwhere you'd need to be an authorized user.\n\n445\n00:22:16.796 --> 00:22:19.790\nBut then there's different grades\nof whatever that would be.\n\n446\n00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:22.620\nSo we wanna think about\na system that looks that way.\n\n447\n00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:25.090\nWhatever it is, however you implement it,\n\n448\n00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:27.930\nwe just have to think about the fact\nthat it's not just enough to say,\n\n449\n00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:31.280\nyeah, everything is just kept secret and\nnobody sees anything.\n\n450\n00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.130\nWe could do that,\n\n451\n00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:35.290\nbut that's probably not a really\neffective way to interact with that.\n\n452\n00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:39.008\nIf our long term goal is simply to\nclassify all data as secret and\n\n453\n00:22:39.008 --> 00:22:43.580\nprevent anybody from seeing it that's\nnot an authorized user in the system.\n\n454\n00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:46.572\nThen we probably just need two\ndesignations, authorized and\n\n455\n00:22:46.572 --> 00:22:47.787\nunauthorized, right?\n\n456\n00:22:47.787 --> 00:22:50.528\nAnd then all data is available\nto authorized users, but\n\n457\n00:22:50.528 --> 00:22:53.110\nno data should be available\nto unauthorized users.\n\n458\n00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:56.640\nAnd that may very well be\na legitimate way to classify.\n\n459\n00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:00.615\nBut the problem with that is,\nyou then have simply one level of access.\n\n460\n00:23:00.615 --> 00:23:04.439\nRegardless of how secret or\nessentially, how normal that data is,\n\n461\n00:23:04.439 --> 00:23:06.460\neverybody's seeing everything.\n\n462\n00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:09.110\nAnd that may or may not be a good thing,\n\n463\n00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:12.370\nbecause what we often find\nis that there are levels,\n\n464\n00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:17.040\nright, or gradations of data secrecy or\nsecurity that have to be applied.\n\n465\n00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.145\nSo it's not just about see everything or\nsee nothing.\n\n466\n00:23:19.145 --> 00:23:23.226\nIt's rather about,\nwhat can I see as an authorized user?\n\n467\n00:23:23.226 --> 00:23:26.850\nAnd at what level do I operate at\nversus what level the data's at?\n\n468\n00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:29.070\nSo this is the thing that we\nhave to start thinking about.\n\n469\n00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:31.840\nAnd again, as incident handlers,\nkeep in mind,\n\n470\n00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:36.240\nthe chances are good we're not\nimplementing, managing, setting up,\n\n471\n00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.390\nand having anything to do\nwith any of these systems.\n\n472\n00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:40.790\nWe're simply looking at\nthem after the fact.\n\n473\n00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:44.422\nPoking them, looking where the holes are\nat or looking to see where the holes are.\n\n474\n00:23:44.422 --> 00:23:48.268\nAnd finding the weaknesses that led to\nthe exposure, bringing them to light,\n\n475\n00:23:48.268 --> 00:23:51.680\ndocumenting them authoritatively,\nand then stepping back.\n\n476\n00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.060\nWe may have nothing to do with\nthese systems normally and\n\n477\n00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:57.210\nhave no direct knowledge of how\nthey operate or how they're set up.\n\n478\n00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:59.386\nWe just may simply report\non them after the fact.\n\n479\n00:23:59.386 --> 00:24:03.366\nSo we have to be clear about the fact\nthat, the more we can verify.\n\n480\n00:24:03.366 --> 00:24:07.032\nThe more we can validate, the more that we\ncan audit The more likely it is we could\n\n481\n00:24:07.032 --> 00:24:10.182\nbe authoritative as incident\nresponders about what is happening.\n\n482\n00:24:10.182 --> 00:24:13.338\nI love to sit with customers and\nwalk through audits with them and\n\n483\n00:24:13.338 --> 00:24:16.153\nask them to show me and\nhelp me to understand what they do.\n\n484\n00:24:16.153 --> 00:24:19.620\nAnd, be presented with documentation\nthat validates those things.\n\n485\n00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:23.460\nI don't like as much doing my job\nwhen I'm sitting with customers and\n\n486\n00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:25.370\nI say, okay can we verify that?\n\n487\n00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:26.360\nCan we randomly sample that?\n\n488\n00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:30.410\nCan you show me the documentation and\nunfortunately,\n\n489\n00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:31.530\nthere are silence in the room.\n\n490\n00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:33.195\nYou hear the birds chirping,\nright, or things like that.\n\n491\n00:24:33.195 --> 00:24:35.620\nAnd, they're not able to do that.\n\n492\n00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:37.351\nAnd it's important to think about that,\nright.\n\n493\n00:24:37.351 --> 00:24:43.040\nThe time to build that documentation,\nthe time to have that auditable solution.\n\n494\n00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:47.030\nThe time to verify is before clearly,\nand I'm sure you know this,\n\n495\n00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:49.010\nright, before the incident occurs.\n\n496\n00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:53.500\nBecause, so many incidents will be\nprevented by having just the simple\n\n497\n00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:56.920\nactivity and action of going and looking\nat what we're supposed to be doing.\n\n498\n00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.930\nAnd ensuring that it's happening, right?\n\n499\n00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:02.870\nThe concept of trust but verify is not\njust something that we speak about.\n\n500\n00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:04.070\nIt's something we should be doing.\n\n501\n00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:07.170\nAnd we make it very clear,\nat least I make it clear to my customers.\n\n502\n00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:11.190\nAnd I make it clear to my students that\nthis is not an opt-in kind of thing.\n\n503\n00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:13.584\nThis is a hey, you do it this way or\nelse kind of thing, all right?\n\n504\n00:25:13.584 --> 00:25:16.839\nIf you want to be good at this,\nyou have to look at everything we do,\n\n505\n00:25:16.839 --> 00:25:19.740\nanything anybody does,\nwith a skeptical eye.\n\n506\n00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:22.250\nI could be the best security\npartitioner in the world,\n\n507\n00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:23.780\nI'm gonna make a mistake\nlike everybody else.\n\n508\n00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:26.080\nThere's no doubt about it,\nit's just a matter of time, right?\n\n509\n00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:28.781\nAnd, if I'm not willing to admit that,\nand say you know,\n\n510\n00:25:28.781 --> 00:25:30.658\nI'm not 100% sure this is correct,\n\n511\n00:25:30.658 --> 00:25:34.319\nLet me get somebody who can look at this\nobjectively, to validate that for me.\n\n512\n00:25:34.319 --> 00:25:36.930\nI'm not doing my job as\nfar as I'm concerned.\n\n513\n00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:38.980\nOr as far as anybody else is concerned.\n\n514\n00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.480\nAnd, you should never be afraid to\nchallenge the common wisdom and\n\n515\n00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.430\nthe assumptions about a system.\n\n516\n00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:45.230\nEspecially instance of a handler.\n\n517\n00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:48.558\nSomebody showing up to figure out after\nthe fact and unwind what went wrong,\n\n518\n00:25:48.558 --> 00:25:51.224\nyou're gonna have to challenge\nevery assumption there is.\n\n519\n00:25:51.224 --> 00:25:54.722\nBecause, one or more of those assumptions\nare the exact reason that you're sitting\n\n520\n00:25:54.722 --> 00:25:57.930\nin the spot you're in doing\nwhat you're doing right now.\n\n521\n00:25:57.930 --> 00:25:59.410\nMeaning, if you're\nresponding to an incident.\n\n522\n00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:00.940\nI know not right now, because you're-\n&gt;&gt; Because you're watching the show.\n\n523\n00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:02.109\n&gt;&gt; Clearly,\nyou're hanging out with us right now,\n\n524\n00:26:02.109 --> 00:26:02.688\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n525\n00:26:02.688 --> 00:26:03.491\n&gt;&gt; But, I mean later, the right now\n\n526\n00:26:03.491 --> 00:26:04.076\nthat comes after that.\n\n527\n00:26:04.076 --> 00:26:04.780\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] They could be doing both.\n\n528\n00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:05.773\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Well, yeah fun.\n\n529\n00:26:05.773 --> 00:26:06.500\nHope not, right.\n\n530\n00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:07.101\nYou want them to focus.\n\n531\n00:26:07.101 --> 00:26:08.909\n&gt;&gt; We've got an incident and Adam Gordon's\ntalking about this very thing.\n\n532\n00:26:08.909 --> 00:26:10.505\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly why you should be doing\n\n533\n00:26:10.505 --> 00:26:11.206\nonly one thing at a time.\n\n534\n00:26:11.206 --> 00:26:12.213\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n535\n00:26:12.213 --> 00:26:13.251\n&gt;&gt; But, what I meant was and\n\n536\n00:26:13.251 --> 00:26:16.814\nI know you know what I I'm suggesting, but\njust simply, when the right time comes and\n\n537\n00:26:16.814 --> 00:26:20.181\nyou are responding, the reason you're\nthere at that time acting in the capacity\n\n538\n00:26:20.181 --> 00:26:23.647\nyou're acting in, is because one or more\nof the assumptions that everybody made is\n\n539\n00:26:23.647 --> 00:26:26.300\nincorrect and\nclearly didn't pan out the right way.\n\n540\n00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:29.402\nIf you don't feel comfortable challenging\nthose assumptions, I got news for\n\n541\n00:26:29.402 --> 00:26:31.713\nyou, you're gonna have a real\ntough time doing this job.\n\n542\n00:26:31.713 --> 00:26:32.951\n&gt;&gt; You're in the wrong business.\n\n543\n00:26:32.951 --> 00:26:35.230\n&gt;&gt; Cuz,\nyou're just not gonna be successful.\n\n544\n00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:37.890\nAnd we've talked about this is so\nmany other conversations we've had in so\n\n545\n00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:39.230\nmany other areas, right?\n\n546\n00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:41.700\nIt's a tough position to find yourself in,\nright?\n\n547\n00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.110\nI understand politically\nthat in a company,\n\n548\n00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:46.580\nespecially one that you\nmay work directly for.\n\n549\n00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:48.900\nIt may be really hard to\nsay to somebody above you,\n\n550\n00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:53.120\nthat you think something they did or\npotentially had authorize to be done,\n\n551\n00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.940\nwas done, incorrectly or\nas result lead to this compromise.\n\n552\n00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:58.953\nIt's hard to have the accountability\nconversation, I get that I really do.\n\n553\n00:26:58.953 --> 00:27:01.110\nAnd, I feel for\npeople that have to have it.\n\n554\n00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:05.526\nIn situations where, it could mean that\nthe outcome is negative for them but\n\n555\n00:27:05.526 --> 00:27:07.466\nyou take on this responsilbity.\n\n556\n00:27:07.466 --> 00:27:11.730\nYou got to step up and awesomely do this,\nthis is what we get paid to do.\n\n557\n00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:14.550\nIt's the uncomfortable conversation so\nwe're asked to have.\n\n558\n00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:16.850\nIt's the uncomfortable facts\nwe're asked to uncover.\n\n559\n00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:20.340\nIt's the things that, went wrong\nthat we're there to talk about or\n\n560\n00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:20.900\nbring to light.\n\n561\n00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:25.480\nIf it was all sunshine, roses and\nunicorns, it would be an easy job right?\n\n562\n00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.120\nBut, the reality is I have\na lot more hair on my head,\n\n563\n00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:31.180\nit wouldn't be gray, it would be dark\nthe way it used to be years ago and\n\n564\n00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:33.720\nit's not because of\nincidents that it's gray.\n\n565\n00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:35.940\nIt's because when you have\nkids this is what happens.\n\n566\n00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:39.990\nBut, the reality is, you gotta have\nthose uncomfortable conversation.\n\n567\n00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:43.960\nA lot of what we do, a lot of what\ni do every day is tremendously,\n\n568\n00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.260\ntremendously important companies,\na lot of it's fun and\n\n569\n00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:50.570\nexciting, but it's tremendously important\nfor the exact reasons we just described\n\n570\n00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:54.290\nbecause we bring to light the concerns\nthat they have to face head on.\n\n571\n00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:57.020\nI tell customers up front when I\nengage in these activities with them.\n\n572\n00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:59.060\nWhen they call up and say,\nhey we need you to come and do this.\n\n573\n00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:01.420\nWe have the okay let's be honest and open.\n\n574\n00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:02.640\nLet's put all of our cards on the table,\n\n575\n00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.550\ntalk about what we're\ngonna do conversation.\n\n576\n00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:06.240\nI make it very clear to them up front,\n\n577\n00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.680\nwe're gonna talk about things\nyou're uncomfortable talking about.\n\n578\n00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:11.530\nI'm gonna show you things in\nthe course of this discussion and\n\n579\n00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:13.930\ninvestigation that you're\nnot gonna wanna see.\n\n580\n00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:17.240\nIf you're not interested in that\nhappening we should probably\n\n581\n00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.200\ntalk about that right now.\n\n582\n00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:18.750\nWe should agree.\n\n583\n00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:21.480\nWe're not gonna be partners and\nthis is not gonna work,\n\n584\n00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:25.310\nbecause if you're not willing to listen\nof the ugly truth, there's no reason for\n\n585\n00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:28.150\nme to spend time and spend your money\ndoing what your asking me to do,\n\n586\n00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:30.770\nbecause that's the conversation\nwere gonna have.\n\n587\n00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:33.060\nI'm gonna find things that are wrong,\nI promise you that.\n\n588\n00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:36.060\nOr, we wanna be talking about the fact\nyou had a breach in the first place,\n\n589\n00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:37.880\nbecause something clearly went wrong.\n\n590\n00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.920\nQuestion is,\ndo you really want to know what it is?\n\n591\n00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:43.190\nAnd I'm just stressing this\nto you as we get started,\n\n592\n00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:45.830\nnot because I wanna scare you off,\nnot because I don't want you to do this.\n\n593\n00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:47.800\nI want you to feel comfortable doing this.\n\n594\n00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.990\nI want you to have fun doing this,\nit's important.\n\n595\n00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:52.280\nBut, I want you to understand\nthe gravity of and\n\n596\n00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:55.990\nthe importance of the conversations you're\ngonna have with customers internally and\n\n597\n00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:57.770\nexternally around incident handling.\n\n598\n00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:00.250\nIt's about the ugly truths that\noccur in our networks, and\n\n599\n00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:02.010\nyou gotta be willing expose that.\n\n600\n00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:05.390\nBut this is the trick, and this is\nwhat I tell customers all the time.\n\n601\n00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:07.080\nI'm gonna tell you some things\nyou don't wanna hear and\n\n602\n00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.490\nshow you things you don't wanna see.\n\n603\n00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:10.028\nBut, at the end of that discussion,\n\n604\n00:29:10.028 --> 00:29:12.568\nI'm gonna show you how to make\nsure they never happen again.\n\n605\n00:29:12.568 --> 00:29:16.823\nAnd I'm out here to help you make sure\nthat the bad things that happen dont keep\n\n606\n00:29:16.823 --> 00:29:19.620\nhappening for\nthe reasons that they happen.\n\n607\n00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:21.670\nI'm not here to make all\nyour pain go away and\n\n608\n00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:24.010\nI'm not here to tell you you're\nnever gonna have a problem again.\n\n609\n00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:26.280\nSomebody else is gonna come along,\ndo something else bad to you,\n\n610\n00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:27.250\nI promise you that.\n\n611\n00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:28.200\nBut, it's not gonna be for\n\n612\n00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:31.720\nthe same reasons we're talking about now,\nif you're willing to be honest and\n\n613\n00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:35.470\nopen with me, and you're willing to\ntake the outcome of our conversation and\n\n614\n00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:38.690\ncreate actionable to-do's that will\nultimately lead to better outcomes.\n\n615\n00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:40.420\nBut it's an incremental game, right?\n\n616\n00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:44.300\nFor every two steps we take forward,\nwe take three steps back in this business,\n\n617\n00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:47.330\nand we've gotta constantly\nbe willing to understand.\n\n618\n00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:50.540\nI've seen some handlers as security\nprofessionals, generically.\n\n619\n00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:56.490\nWe stand on the front lines and it's our\njob to make sure that the same silly and\n\n620\n00:29:56.490 --> 00:29:59.020\nstupid activities don't lead\nto the same mistakes over and\n\n621\n00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:02.400\nover again, because we get smarter and\nbetter at what we do over time.\n\n622\n00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:06.980\nAnd if we're willing to face that reality,\nundertake that responsibility and\n\n623\n00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:09.670\nact accordingly, ourselves,\nour customer, and\n\n624\n00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:12.210\neverybody around us will be the better for\nit.\n\n625\n00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:14.743\nBut, this is what it means\nto be an handler ultimately.\n\n626\n00:30:14.743 --> 00:30:17.490\nAnd this is the responsibility you\nhave to be willing to take on.\n\n627\n00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:20.080\nOtherwise, that could teach you how to\nmake the perfect cup of espresso which is\n\n628\n00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.880\nalso an equally great outcome.\n\n629\n00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:24.875\nIf you know anything about me, you know\nhow passionate I am about espresso, but\n\n630\n00:30:24.875 --> 00:30:26.262\nthat is for another conversation and\n\n631\n00:30:26.262 --> 00:30:28.740\nfor another time good sir 'cuz I\nthink our clock has ticked down.\n\n632\n00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.504\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nour clock has ticked down, but\n\n633\n00:30:30.504 --> 00:30:32.770\nAdam you were dropping some\nserious truth bombs on us.\n\n634\n00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:33.376\nWe have to.\n\n635\n00:30:33.376 --> 00:30:35.120\n&gt;&gt; TBs.\n&gt;&gt; Understand it, that's right, TBs.\n\n636\n00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:35.880\n&gt;&gt; Not FBs.\n\n637\n00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:36.508\n&gt;&gt; Not FBs.\n&gt;&gt; TBs.\n\n638\n00:30:36.508 --> 00:30:37.243\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Truth bombs.\n\n639\n00:30:37.243 --> 00:30:37.745\n&gt;&gt; Truth bombs.\n\n640\n00:30:37.745 --> 00:30:39.310\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and\nwe all understand this, right?\n\n641\n00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:40.660\nThat's gonna be part of the job.\n\n642\n00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:43.420\nIt's not just knowing facts and\nfigures about, security and\n\n643\n00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:47.320\nhandling an incident when someone happens,\nand what to do and the steps to take.\n\n644\n00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:50.780\nIt's working with the people\nthat maybe have caused this,\n\n645\n00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:53.480\nmaybe it was their fault, and you have\nto deal with them and let them know,\n\n646\n00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:56.560\nhey, it was this thing\nthat you did specifically.\n\n647\n00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:58.450\nAnd, that can be a hard\nconversation to have.\n\n648\n00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:01.080\nSo, if you don't have\nthe intestinal fortitude,\n\n649\n00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:03.650\nas it were, you might wanna get you some\n\n650\n00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:07.620\nbecause that day is a coming if this is\nthe line of work you're gonna get into.\n\n651\n00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:10.200\nAnd Adam, you did a great\njob of explaining that, and\n\n652\n00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:12.320\nputting it right out there\nat the very beginning so\n\n653\n00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:15.580\nwe have no misunderstandings\nto our audience out there.\n\n654\n00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:17.410\nBut you're right,\nwe are out of time for this episode.\n\n655\n00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:20.050\nWe're gonna have to continue\nthis conversation in a part two.\n\n656\n00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:22.000\nHopefully, we'll see\nyou good people there.\n\n657\n00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:22.900\nAdam, thanks for joining us.\n\n658\n00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:24.330\nAnd we do thank you for watching.\n\n659\n00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:27.440\nSigning off

our\nconversation where we left off.\n\n21\n00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.930\nWe were talking in our last discussion\n\n22\n00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.720\nabout some of the background\nthought processes.\n\n23\n00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.550\nWe talked about the importance\nof root cause analysis, spoke\n\n24\n00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.460\nabout the importance of understanding\nhow to have the accountability and\n\n25\n00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.340\nresponsibility conversation with\nthe people that you are working with.\n\n26\n00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.000\nAnd we defined some basic terms.\n\n27\n00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.620\nTalked about assets, talked about how to\nclassify data, how important things are in\n\n28\n00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.440\nunderstanding that importance with\nregards to incident handling.\n\n29\n00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.200\nBut we have to build on that knowledge\nas Daniel was suggesting and\n\n30\n00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.560\nadd some more information and\ndepth to our conversation.\n\n31\n00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.830\nSo let's talk about some\ncommon terminology.\n\n32\n00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.000\nWe have the concepts of information\nsystems, data ownership and\n\n33\n00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.140\ndata custodianship.\n\n34\n00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.950\nFor information ownership,\ninformation custodianship,\n\n35\n00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.360\nyou can view them either way.\n\n36\n00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.620\nI mentioned data ownership and\n\n37\n00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.540\ncustodianship in the bottom conversation\nand passing just as common on the side,\n\n38\n00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.960\nbut we didn't wanna go on\nthe detail of what they represent.\n\n39\n00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.460\nSo, I want to make sure we're\ncomfortable with these terms.\n\n40\n00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.720\nVocabulary is so important to what\nwe do in information security.\n\n41\n00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.460\nUnderstanding the baseline or\n\n42\n00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.260\nthe general thought process that we\nengage in as part of a dialogue.\n\n43\n00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.580\nMaking sure everybody is on the same page.\n\n44\n00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.740\nAnd that we are speaking the same language\nand meaning the same things when we speak\n\n45\n00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.720\nabout those terms is very\nimportant criteria for success.\n\n46\n00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.510\nAnd so information system,\nsometimes referred to as the ISMS,\n\n47\n00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.620\nthe Information Security\nManagement System,\n\n48\n00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.870\nbut generically the IS, the information\nsystem, is the computer, or\n\n49\n00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.070\nthe targeted system that we are going to\nbe looking at, managing, interacting with.\n\n50\n00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.350\nIn this case, with regards to\ninstant handling, examining, and\n\n51\n00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.310\nmost likely doing some sort\nof triage with, right?\n\n52\n00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.210\nIt's the system that modifies raw data,\ncreates it, manipulates it, manages it,\n\n53\n00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.420\nstores it, uses it, presents it, etcetera,\nall of the activities we would think\n\n54\n00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.540\nabout, and allows users to interact\nwith that data in one or more\n\n55\n00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.320\nways with regards to whatever it is that\nthey need to do to accomplish their jobs.\n\n56\n00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.780\nAll of us, in other words, use\ninformation systems on a regular basis.\n\n57\n00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.340\nWe all have computers or mobile devices or\n\n58\n00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.550\nsome sort of electronic device\nthat accesses data today.\n\n59\n00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.676\nProbably more than one.\n\n60\n00:02:46.676 --> 00:02:49.050\nI have a tablet, I have a laptop,\n\n61\n00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.020\nI have two laptops sitting on\nthe desk here in front of me.\n\n62\n00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.610\nI have a smart phone, although most people\nmake fun of if because it's a Blackberry,\n\n63\n00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.500\nbut it is still a good\nphone none the less.\n\n64\n00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.940\nIt's a more intelligent phone\nthan most people realize.\n\n65\n00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.260\nAlthough, these days, with all the\nproblems going on with my older version,\n\n66\n00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.160\nI can no longer run almost any\nof the apps that I did have.\n\n67\n00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.790\nThe small number of apps that I\ndid have on it no longer work.\n\n68\n00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.430\nAs we make our change over to\nthe Android operating system.\n\n69\n00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.870\nBut nonetheless, it is a smart phone.\n\n70\n00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.780\nAnd any of these devices, all of them are\ninformation systems in one way or another.\n\n71\n00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.950\nI can create, interact with,\nmodify, consume, use, and\n\n72\n00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.340\nmanipulate data using them.\n\n73\n00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.550\nThat's definition of\nan information system.\n\n74\n00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.650\nIt allows us to share and\nprocess information and\n\n75\n00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.690\nto interact with it in one or more ways.\n\n76\n00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.350\nInformation ownership, data ownership is\nabout the creation of that information.\n\n77\n00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.100\nWe classify owners as the people\nthat are data creating\n\n78\n00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.170\ninformation in one form or another.\n\n79\n00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.470\nAnd then are going to ultimately have the\nfinal say as to who gets to access that\n\n80\n00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.860\ndata under what conditions and\nto what end or for what purpose.\n\n81\n00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.270\nAnd so ownership is all about\nunderstanding that, number one,\n\n82\n00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.540\nit's the first and most important\ncriteria, you have created something.\n\n83\n00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.880\nAnd then number two, that you have rights\nto then decide from an information\n\n84\n00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.390\nmanagement and account control\nperspective, access control, who will or\n\n85\n00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.370\nwill not be given rights to that data.\n\n86\n00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.570\nOwnership implies final\ndecision making authority,\n\n87\n00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.780\nwhereas custodianship is the role or\n\n88\n00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.080\nthe act of implementing the access control\nthoughts and requirements from owners.\n\n89\n00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.150\nSo if an owner says to me, I would like\nAdam to be able to have this level of\n\n90\n00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.800\naccess and Daniel to have that level of\naccess, the custodian has to go out and\n\n91\n00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.240\nimplement that system, and then monitor\nthe data and ensure that Adam and\n\n92\n00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.240\nDaniel both have rights to\nwhatever specification or\n\n93\n00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.540\nlevel the owner has actually laid out for\nus.\n\n94\n00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.140\nSo custodianship is about the interaction,\nthe day to day oversight and\n\n95\n00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.130\nmanagement of data, whereas\nownership is about the creation and\n\n96\n00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.450\nthe overarching responsibility for\nthat data in the organization from\n\n97\n00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.822\na governance perspective as well as from\na axis control perspective, ultimately.\n\n98\n00:04:56.822 --> 00:05:00.480\nWant to make sure we differentiate between\nthese roles, because it's very important\n\n99\n00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.610\nto know that there ultimately\ntypically is one owner for data.\n\n100\n00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.430\nAnd there may by more than one custodian,\ndepending on where data lives, and\n\n101\n00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.280\nin how many systems that data may or\nmay not be accessible through.\n\n102\n00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.330\nAnd I'm not talking about end users\nthat consume data, I'm talking about\n\n103\n00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.050\nthe custodians that interact with data,\nto manage and to oversee it,\n\n104\n00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.750\nbecause if the data is stored in\nmultiple places through replication or\n\n105\n00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.260\nsome sort of cloud-based\ndistribution technology,\n\n106\n00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.730\nthere may be multiple administrators that\nact essentially in the role of custodian.\n\n107\n00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.770\nAnd we have to keep that in mind,\nand think about that, and\n\n108\n00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:33.830\nunderstand that as well.\n\n109\n00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.880\nSo, it is something just to bear in mind.\n\n110\n00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.740\nBut we want to make sure we have a good,\nformal,\n\n111\n00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.280\nthorough understanding of\nthe definitions of these terms,\n\n112\n00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.170\nfrom the vocabulary perspective\nthey are very important.\n\n113\n00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.170\nI speak of vocabulary and\n\n114\n00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.740\nI thinks they're important,\nwhat about the information warfare?\n\n115\n00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.365\nA topic we hear so much about these days.\n\n116\n00:05:50.365 --> 00:05:53.365\nAlthough we hear the discussions about so\nmany different ways.\n\n117\n00:05:53.365 --> 00:05:56.360\nWe hear cyber war, cyber warfare.\n\n118\n00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.530\nWe hear all sort of stories about things\nthat have going on, either between one or\n\n119\n00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.990\nmore countries, or between actors\nrepresenting those countries proxies, and\n\n120\n00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.530\nthis term is often used and misused very,\nvery liberally these days, but\n\n121\n00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:14.200\ngenerically, the idea of information\nwarfare is the idea of using\n\n122\n00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:19.360\ncomputers and work Information systems\nto be able to execute attacks or\n\n123\n00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.740\nsomehow execute access illegally and\nagainst the policies and\n\n124\n00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.870\nprocedures in place on those\nsystems against other systems.\n\n125\n00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.670\nIn other words, traditionally what\nwe would define as hacking, right?\n\n126\n00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:31.950\nAnd the idea of cyber warfare or\n\n127\n00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.770\ninformation warfare is really\nthe fundamental idea of being able to use\n\n128\n00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.710\ninformation systems to attack\nother information systems.\n\n129\n00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:44.390\nAnd the actors that are doing so are cyber\nwarriors, people we often hear about and\n\n130\n00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:45.620\ntalk a lot about today.\n\n131\n00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.540\nWhen you are defending your\nsystems against others,\n\n132\n00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.305\nyou're acting in a defensive role.\n\n133\n00:06:50.305 --> 00:06:53.675\nWhen you are engaging this activity\noffensively against others,\n\n134\n00:06:53.675 --> 00:06:55.785\nyou're acting in an offensive manner.\n\n135\n00:06:55.785 --> 00:06:59.765\nHackers may be deployed on both ends\nof that spectrum, ethical hackers,\n\n136\n00:06:59.765 --> 00:07:03.505\nas we've certainly spoken about in\nother courses and other conversations,\n\n137\n00:07:03.505 --> 00:07:08.725\nare acting, usually on the defensive side\nto prevent those attacks, where as hackers\n\n138\n00:07:08.725 --> 00:07:12.610\nthat act in bad faith, that are out\nprobably for fun and profit, most likely.\n\n139\n00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.790\nAre acting on the offensive side\nto see if they can break in.\n\n140\n00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:17.950\nBoth sets of activities\nhave to be monitored and\n\n141\n00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:21.170\nlooked at closely by incident handlers,\nbecause we have to be aware of\n\n142\n00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:24.460\nwhat activities are taking place in\norder to better understand the story and\n\n143\n00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.560\nthe scope of whatever we may\nbe asked to investigate.\n\n144\n00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.490\nAnd we may not know on the surface\nwhether it was a friendly or\n\n145\n00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:32.620\nan unfriendly act that we're\nbeing asked to investigate.\n\n146\n00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.300\nAnd so we get in and\nstart moving around a little bit and\n\n147\n00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.680\nunderstanding what's been going on.\n\n148\n00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.767\nThere are many instances in my career\nover the many years I've been doing this,\n\n149\n00:07:40.767 --> 00:07:45.038\nmany decades that I've been doing this,\nthat I've been asked to investigate some\n\n150\n00:07:45.038 --> 00:07:48.718\nsort of an event or undertake\nan investigation on behalf of a customer.\n\n151\n00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:52.970\nAnd it turns out that a lot of the time\nit certainly is nefarious activity.\n\n152\n00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:56.516\nIt is somebody being up to no good and\nwe clearly identify that.\n\n153\n00:07:56.516 --> 00:08:00.272\nMuch rarer and off in the corner\nas a business case, as it were.\n\n154\n00:08:00.272 --> 00:08:04.229\nBut occasionally, we find evidence of the\nfact that these are activities that were\n\n155\n00:08:04.229 --> 00:08:08.210\nengaged in legitimately by the legitimate\nactors inside the organization.\n\n156\n00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.260\nBut because their activities\nwere not properly documented,\n\n157\n00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.820\nthey perhaps didn't follow the proper\nchange management procedures.\n\n158\n00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:18.822\nMaybe they didn't notify the appropriate\npeople or take those activities during\n\n159\n00:08:18.822 --> 00:08:22.476\nnormal maintenance windows, or you know\nwhatever the case may be that they\n\n160\n00:08:22.476 --> 00:08:26.550\nwould normally do in order to prevent this\nkind of activity from raising red flags.\n\n161\n00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:30.168\nAnd as a result we are sometimes\ndiagnosing activities that prove to be\n\n162\n00:08:30.168 --> 00:08:31.088\nlegitimate, but\n\n163\n00:08:31.088 --> 00:08:35.580\non the surface look illegitimate because\nof the way in which they were executed.\n\n164\n00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.850\nEssentially, somebody violated a policy or\nforgot to dot an I or cross a t or\n\n165\n00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:41.260\nfollow a procedure.\n\n166\n00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.980\nAnd that comes out later, and that's okay.\n\n167\n00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.820\nWe figure that out and it's not\nthe end of the world by any means.\n\n168\n00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:49.758\nBut it is important to understand\nthat these policies and procedures,\n\n169\n00:08:49.758 --> 00:08:51.143\nas I trip over my tongue.\n\n170\n00:08:51.143 --> 00:08:53.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; These procedures exist for a reason.\n\n171\n00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:57.510\nAnd one of the things that we\noften have to think about and\n\n172\n00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:00.660\nI really try to impress on students and\ncustomers when I teach or\n\n173\n00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.890\nwork with them is that these\nthings exist for a reason, right?\n\n174\n00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:04.562\nWe don't operate in a vacuum.\n\n175\n00:09:04.562 --> 00:09:07.483\nWe don't tell stories just because\nthey're interesting to hear.\n\n176\n00:09:07.483 --> 00:09:11.670\nAnd we don't try to enforce upon you,\nand impress upon you, the importance of\n\n177\n00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:15.548\nstandardized behavior, because we\nhave nothing better to do, right.\n\n178\n00:09:15.548 --> 00:09:19.663\n[LAUGH] I mean I gotta lot better things\nto do than stand around and for the 20th\n\n179\n00:09:19.663 --> 00:09:23.928\ntime that month explain to somebody why\nthey need to do something a certain way.\n\n180\n00:09:23.928 --> 00:09:26.664\nYou know, I don't just, I fundamentally,\n\n181\n00:09:26.664 --> 00:09:31.010\nlegitimately have better ways to\nspend my time as do all of you.\n\n182\n00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:32.600\nBut that's part of our job, right.\n\n183\n00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.054\nThat's what information security\nprofessionals have to sign on to do.\n\n184\n00:09:36.054 --> 00:09:39.933\nWe have to be willing to explain to people\nthe reasons why we have to do things\n\n185\n00:09:39.933 --> 00:09:43.568\na certain way because not everybody\nunderstands the importance of and\n\n186\n00:09:43.568 --> 00:09:45.360\nthe reasons why we do things.\n\n187\n00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.386\nBut we also have to be smart\nabout what we do, right?\n\n188\n00:09:47.386 --> 00:09:51.125\nAnd I'm a firm believer in\nworking smarter and not harder.\n\n189\n00:09:51.125 --> 00:09:53.538\nAs catchy as a term as that may be and\n\n190\n00:09:53.538 --> 00:09:57.130\nas kitschy as a phrase as\nthat may sound like today.\n\n191\n00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.882\nI fundamentally believe\nthat if we work hard at it,\n\n192\n00:09:59.882 --> 00:10:02.890\nwe can actually not work as\nhard as crazy as that sounds,\n\n193\n00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:06.538\nbecause I do believe that if we're\nreally good at telling stories.\n\n194\n00:10:06.538 --> 00:10:11.488\nIf we're good at documenting, if we're\ngood at explaining and we're good at\n\n195\n00:10:11.488 --> 00:10:16.438\nasking people to pay attention and listen,\nthen we do a lot less work on the back\n\n196\n00:10:16.438 --> 00:10:21.080\nend as instant responders than we\ndo on the front end, explaining.\n\n197\n00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.020\nBut the challenge, unfortunately,\n\n198\n00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:27.430\nvery often is, we don't institutionalize\nthat knowledge and that thought process.\n\n199\n00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:31.528\nAnd as a result, we do a really good job\nup front with a certain group of people at\n\n200\n00:10:31.528 --> 00:10:32.907\na certain moment in time.\n\n201\n00:10:32.907 --> 00:10:36.840\nKind of frozen, if you will,\nas we explain things.\n\n202\n00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:41.763\nAnd that groups goes off, and\nhas drunk the Kool-Aid, so to speak.\n\n203\n00:10:41.763 --> 00:10:43.270\nAnd operates accordingly.\nBut then we get new people coming\n\n204\n00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:44.680\ninto the business over time.\n\n205\n00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.770\nAnd if we're not focused on training and\nawareness,\n\n206\n00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:51.150\nwhich is the absolute\nbottom bedrock assumption\n\n207\n00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:56.230\nthat we need to figure out how to overcome\nand use to our advantage in any business.\n\n208\n00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:59.265\nIf we're not good at translating\nthat knowledge forward, and\n\n209\n00:10:59.265 --> 00:11:02.414\nit's not tribal knowledge stuck\nin our heads that's verbally,\n\n210\n00:11:02.414 --> 00:11:04.500\nkind of spread around the campfire.\n\n211\n00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.420\nBut rather is institutionalized\ndocumented and\n\n212\n00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:11.370\nhas become part of a cultural\nethos of the organization.\n\n213\n00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:15.520\nThen if we're able to achieve\nthat level we work less hard\n\n214\n00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.700\nin order to maintain that status.\n\n215\n00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:23.044\nBut if it's verbal tribal\nknowledge passed down by elders,\n\n216\n00:11:23.044 --> 00:11:28.403\nright In special ceremonies at\nnight when nobody is around.\n\n217\n00:11:28.403 --> 00:11:29.205\nI promise you,\nyou're gonna be chasing what I call\n\n218\n00:11:29.205 --> 00:11:29.828\npurple squirrels for the rest of life.\n\n219\n00:11:29.828 --> 00:11:30.372\nYou know why they're\ncalled purple squirrels?\n\n220\n00:11:30.372 --> 00:11:33.081\nHave you ever seen a purple squirrel,\nthey don't exist, [LAUGH] right?\n\n221\n00:11:33.081 --> 00:11:35.042\nBecause they're just phantom creatures.\n\n222\n00:11:35.042 --> 00:11:38.846\nYou're gonna be constantly chasing those\nshadows, trying to get rid of them in your\n\n223\n00:11:38.846 --> 00:11:42.613\nnetworks, because people are gonna have\nthe wrong idea about what they have to do.\n\n224\n00:11:42.613 --> 00:11:46.843\nAnd why because when you play telephone\nand you essentially push knowledge through\n\n225\n00:11:46.843 --> 00:11:50.721\nan organization verbally, it changes\nright and that's just the way it is.\n\n226\n00:11:50.721 --> 00:11:54.628\nYou start out with we need to do this\nthis way for this reason, and three or\n\n227\n00:11:54.628 --> 00:11:58.410\nfour generations later when it comes\nback around you wind up hearing\n\n228\n00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:02.510\nwe're having a party tonight, or\nthere is drinks at five at the bar.\n\n229\n00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:05.370\nI mean you hear all the crazy stuff\nthat doesn't really pertain to what\n\n230\n00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:07.800\nyou're doing and\nthis is the challenge we have.\n\n231\n00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:11.100\nPeople look at what I do for a living,\nwhat you do, what we do for a living,\n\n232\n00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:16.110\nall of you listening to us and they think\nit's incredibly complicated and difficult.\n\n233\n00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:19.270\nAnd don't get me wrong,\nI'm not selling short what all of you do.\n\n234\n00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.750\nSecurity, IT, administration.\n\n235\n00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:26.210\nAll the stuff we all do and say to others\nwe do, is incredibly difficult stuff.\n\n236\n00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:26.750\nI've done it.\n\n237\n00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:28.870\nI do it and\nI understand how difficult it is.\n\n238\n00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:29.890\nBelieve me.\n\n239\n00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:30.760\nI've done it for decades.\n\n240\n00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.200\nI know exactly how difficult it is.\n\n241\n00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.120\nI was much taller and I had hair\nwhen I started out doing this right?\n\n242\n00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.495\nAnd look at me now.\nI'm only 12 and a half inches high and\n\n243\n00:12:38.495 --> 00:12:40.760\nI have almost no hair on my head.\n\n244\n00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:45.630\nBut the reality is, that for\nall the difficult things we do,\n\n245\n00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:48.730\nwhat we do, you have to have a passion for\nanything you to do be good at it, but\n\n246\n00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:51.780\nwhat we do is not incredibly difficult.\n\n247\n00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:54.250\nIt's just incredibly\ndifficult because people\n\n248\n00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.860\nrefuse to understand how to make it easy.\n\n249\n00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.560\nAnd is incredibly difficult because\npeople don't pay attention to\n\n250\n00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.820\nthe common sense things\nthat would make it easier.\n\n251\n00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.970\nAnd that's one of the things that\nwe have to think about as security\n\n252\n00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:04.970\nprofessionals right?\n\n253\n00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:08.650\nIf we can get people to pay attention\nto details, educate them and\n\n254\n00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:12.760\nhave them educate others the right way,\nand we standardize our responses to\n\n255\n00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.730\nsituations, our jobs become a lot\neasier as instance handlers.\n\n256\n00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:19.870\nAnd this is one of the unspoken\nsecrets of instant handling.\n\n257\n00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:23.910\nYou've gotta be good at awareness and\ntraining prior to the event in order to\n\n258\n00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:26.509\nbe able to respond\neffectively after the event.\n\n259\n00:13:26.509 --> 00:13:29.616\nAnd this is the thing they don't often\nteach you and they don't tell you that we\n\n260\n00:13:29.616 --> 00:13:32.790\njust kinda keep this knowledge that we\ndon't often share with people, right?\n\n261\n00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:35.650\nBut this is the important thing,\nthis is the secret ingredient.\n\n262\n00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:37.390\n&gt;&gt; And the river is always changing.\n\n263\n00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:40.310\nYou never step in the same river\ntwice as they like to say.\n\n264\n00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:43.971\nJust because you learn something today\ndoesn't mean that you don't need to learn\n\n265\n00:13:43.971 --> 00:13:45.150\nsomething new tomorrow.\n\n266\n00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:48.518\nIt's a constantly evolving and\nrevolving atmosphere.\n\n267\n00:13:48.518 --> 00:13:51.955\nJust because somebody went\nthrough awareness training for\n\n268\n00:13:51.955 --> 00:13:56.697\nsecurity in your company doesn't mean that\nthey are prepared ten weeks from now to\n\n269\n00:13:56.697 --> 00:13:58.838\nhandle something that might be new.\n\n270\n00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:02.783\nSo there's always this constant\nreiteration of stuff they should know and\n\n271\n00:14:02.783 --> 00:14:06.054\nnew stuff that they did to know so\nit's always us coming at it.\n\n272\n00:14:06.054 --> 00:14:09.410\nAnd you start thinking of are users,\nagain,\n\n273\n00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:13.559\nthey don't want to get how would\nyou say is the best way to\n\n274\n00:14:13.559 --> 00:14:17.911\nget our users to really take\nthat kind of thing seriously.\n\n275\n00:14:17.911 --> 00:14:24.893\nAnd to, for us to impart that knowledge\nin an effective way that they can use it.\n\n276\n00:14:24.893 --> 00:14:26.030\n&gt;&gt; So, it's a great question.\nSo, you know I think there's\n\n277\n00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.690\na couple of things.\n\n278\n00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:30.680\nObviously, coercion and\nbribery are at the top of the list,\n\n279\n00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.070\nthere's no doubt about that.\n\n280\n00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:34.696\nBut aside from those things.\n\n281\n00:14:34.696 --> 00:14:35.826\nAnd I am kidding by the way, right?\n\n282\n00:14:35.826 --> 00:14:37.630\nYou definitely do not coerce users.\nThat is unacceptable behavior.\n\n283\n00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:39.570\nBribery perhaps but no coercion.\n\n284\n00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:42.300\nBut aside from things like training and\nawareness, right?\n\n285\n00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.730\nAll seriousness for just the moment\ncuz Daniel asked some very good but\n\n286\n00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:47.580\nalso very serious and important question.\n\n287\n00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:52.328\nSo we have to obviously focus on security,\nand training and awareness.\n\n288\n00:14:52.328 --> 00:14:53.880\nBut that's tough, as Daniel said.\nIt may not be enough just to\n\n289\n00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.920\ncontinuously have the mantra of hey,\n\n290\n00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.470\nyou gotta do it this way, because\npeople get tired of hearing it, right.\n\n291\n00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:01.746\nSo I firmly believe that while\nawareness and training are important,\n\n292\n00:15:01.746 --> 00:15:04.388\nI think it's the activities\nwe engage in everyday, right?\n\n293\n00:15:04.388 --> 00:15:05.286\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; We talk a lot and\n\n294\n00:15:05.286 --> 00:15:09.110\npay lip service a lot to the idea of,\nwalk the walk and talk the talk.\n\n295\n00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.600\nBut I think when you're an administrator,\n\n296\n00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.720\nthat operates from the perspective of,\nI am a user first and foremost and\n\n297\n00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:19.560\nI behave the same way that I\nexpect my users to behave.\n\n298\n00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.240\nAnd I don't carve out exceptions for\nmyself.\n\n299\n00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:26.940\nBut rather, I operate as if I am a user\nand therefore bound by the same rules.\n\n300\n00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:30.040\nI think it's the example that you set, in\nother words, and leading from the front.\n\n301\n00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:33.960\nAs we often hear, is what I would say\nis the best answer to the question,\n\n302\n00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.670\nbecause I think it is\nthe most impactful right?\n\n303\n00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:41.608\nWhen people see that the professionals\nthat are supposed to be in charge,\n\n304\n00:15:41.608 --> 00:15:44.385\nthat are supposed to know better,\n\n305\n00:15:44.385 --> 00:15:49.298\nare doing the random stuff that\nthey are being told not to do.\n\n306\n00:15:49.298 --> 00:15:49.916\nIt's very hard for\nan average user to say yeah,\n\n307\n00:15:49.916 --> 00:15:50.650\nwell, I won't do that even\nthough you're doing that.\n\n308\n00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:53.064\nMonkey see, monkey do.\nI think if we behave the way we intend and\n\n309\n00:15:53.064 --> 00:15:56.520\nexpect our users to behave,\nand we're public about that,\n\n310\n00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.954\nthen I think that is much more important.\n\n311\n00:15:58.954 --> 00:16:01.392\nSo I do think that's,\nat least from my perspective,\n\n312\n00:16:01.392 --> 00:16:03.028\nthe approach I would take, right?\n\n313\n00:16:03.028 --> 00:16:07.010\nSo I would lead by example,\nto answer Daniel's question.\n\n314\n00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:10.820\nand I think that's very important for\nsecurity professionals to think about.\n\n315\n00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:14.930\nBecause we often forget that first and\nforemost, we are users in those systems,\n\n316\n00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:19.700\nand people look at us that way, and\nthey have to understand what they see, and\n\n317\n00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.850\nhave it make sense based\non what we're telling them.\n\n318\n00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:24.710\nOr they're gonna feel that there's\nsome sort of a caste system.\n\n319\n00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:26.750\nThere's different levels\nof acceptable behavior,\n\n320\n00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.280\nand that's not the message we wanna send.\n\n321\n00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:33.620\nI wanna absolute bare minimum\nacceptable standard of behavior\n\n322\n00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.600\nthat everybody follows,\nmeaning everybody behaves the same way.\n\n323\n00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.733\ni don't want there to be exceptions,\nand rules for this person, and\n\n324\n00:16:39.733 --> 00:16:41.471\nthat person under these conditions.\n\n325\n00:16:41.471 --> 00:16:45.901\nIf I can avoid it I understand political\nrealities I know there are sea level\n\n326\n00:16:45.901 --> 00:16:50.401\nexecutives or senior leaders and\nthis expect to the treated differently and\n\n327\n00:16:50.401 --> 00:16:51.870\nacting fully.\n\n328\n00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:54.390\nI can be my head against local data so\nI can change.\n\n329\n00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:58.290\nSo either I accept that and manage that\naccordingly but they make everybody else\n\n330\n00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:04.510\nbehave with relatively similar behavior\npatterns, or I spend all my time\n\n331\n00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:07.890\nchasing purple squirrels trying to figure\nout why nobody pays attention to anything.\n\n332\n00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:11.970\nSo I'd rather be up front with my\ncustomers and explain to them that, and\n\n333\n00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:14.890\nI have this conversation with CEO\nlevel executives all the time.\n\n334\n00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:18.725\nYou have two choices to make, either\nyou have different levels of acceptable\n\n335\n00:17:18.725 --> 00:17:22.861\nbehavior in this business, and therefore\nyou're going to invite a lot more risk.\n\n336\n00:17:22.861 --> 00:17:26.427\nThis business you're gonna have to\naddress that or if you're serious about\n\n337\n00:17:26.427 --> 00:17:30.680\nmitigating risk, and minimizing incidents,\nthen everybody be place by the same rules.\n\n338\n00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.720\nI don't care how important you\nthink you are in the business.\n\n339\n00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:37.240\nGood user behaviors could use a behavior\nwhether you run the company or\n\n340\n00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.290\nwhether you answer phones or\nanything in between.\n\n341\n00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:43.890\nAnd so I think it's important to be honest\nand upfront with everybody, and again,\n\n342\n00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:45.930\nI do understand, big disclaimer, right?\n\n343\n00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:48.730\nWe gotta get that red disclaimer arrow\nlight we talked about working, so\n\n344\n00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:50.910\nwe can just have it pop up\nwhen I'm talking, right?\n\n345\n00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:52.120\nBig disclaimer.\n\n346\n00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:55.800\nI understand that, politically,\nit's very difficult and perhaps impossible\n\n347\n00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:00.790\nin many of your organizations to go to\nyour head of the company and say hey,\n\n348\n00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:03.000\nyou need to play by the same\nrules that everybody else does.\n\n349\n00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.583\nI get that, cuz I have it all the time.\n\n350\n00:18:04.583 --> 00:18:08.214\nI'm in a unique position, I dont work for\nmany of the companies I consult for\n\n351\n00:18:08.214 --> 00:18:11.900\nand, as a result I dont have to worry\nabout that because, I can say honestly to\n\n352\n00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:15.872\nthe person that called me in, look here's\nthe deal you want to solve your problem,\n\n353\n00:18:15.872 --> 00:18:18.580\nhere's what you do if you\ncan't make that work in this.\n\n354\n00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:21.260\nI get that lets talk about\nother things that will work but\n\n355\n00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:26.930\nunderstand this equals more\nrisk in those conversations.\n\n356\n00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:29.300\nWe're gonna have some very thorough and\n\n357\n00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:34.010\nvery interesting conversations about\nrisk coming up in future discussions.\n\n358\n00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:37.520\nBut what I often find about risk,\nis that when you lay bare what risk is in\n\n359\n00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:42.870\nthe business, for the senior leaders who\nmay have a behavioral attention problem,\n\n360\n00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:46.480\nthat they often get it, because that's\nthe one thing they're focused on.\n\n361\n00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:50.990\nDollar signs and risk are two of the big\nthings the c level suite understands.\n\n362\n00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:55.440\nAnd when you can couch your argument and\nbuild your business case in those terms,\n\n363\n00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:00.210\nand it's a stark conversation with them\nabout risk equaling more dollars spend.\n\n364\n00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:04.060\nAnd as a result, more liability for the\nbusiness, it's something they actual pay\n\n365\n00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.950\nattention to, believe it or not,\nand they will find value on that.\n\n366\n00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:10.190\nAnd I think ultimately you will\nfind that those conversations,\n\n367\n00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:14.210\nnot only become more profitable, but also\nput you in a better light as a security\n\n368\n00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:18.230\npractitioner and instant handler, because\nthey now have new found respect for\n\n369\n00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:21.599\nyour ability to understand\nthe business from their perspective.\n\n370\n00:19:21.599 --> 00:19:22.159\n&gt;&gt; Do you put their.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n371\n00:19:22.159 --> 00:19:24.168\nthey're more likely to follow\nyour guidance as a result.\n\n372\n00:19:24.168 --> 00:19:29.230\n&gt;&gt; Do you put their hubris inside of your\n&gt;&gt; What's the word,\n\n373\n00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:32.105\nrisk management chart or whatever?\n\n374\n00:19:32.105 --> 00:19:35.031\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we were talking about, what Daniel's\n\n375\n00:19:35.031 --> 00:19:38.543\nasking about, we had a conversation\noffline between our conversations about\n\n376\n00:19:38.543 --> 00:19:42.213\ndifferent ways of looking at risk, in\na RACI chart, in a risk assessment matrix,\n\n377\n00:19:42.213 --> 00:19:45.630\nand some of the other things that we\nwill come up and we will talk about.\n\n378\n00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:46.370\nAnd if you haven't seen them,\n\n379\n00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:48.790\nyou don't know what they are, make sure\nyou tune in for those discussions,\n\n380\n00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:50.570\nthey'll be very enlightening for you.\n\n381\n00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:54.933\n&gt;&gt; So Daniel is essentially asking, hey,\ndo you essentially capture that, and\n\n382\n00:19:54.933 --> 00:19:56.198\ndo you document that?\n\n383\n00:19:56.198 --> 00:19:56.872\n&gt;&gt; How do you qualify that?\n\n384\n00:19:56.872 --> 00:19:58.250\n&gt;&gt; On a line item somewhere.\n\n385\n00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:00.340\nDo you then have the ability to say but\nI told you so, right?\n\n386\n00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:01.820\nI mean, it's right there.\n\n387\n00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:06.290\nLook, the reality of the world is such\nthat, I've learned over the years that\n\n388\n00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:10.760\nI've done this that you can be that\nperson that wants to look backwards and\n\n389\n00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:13.390\nsay, but I told you so, it's right here.\n\n390\n00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:16.800\nYou guys,\nyou should have paid attention to me.\n\n391\n00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.690\nThere's an old saying,\nit's one thing to be an idiot,\n\n392\n00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:22.070\nit's another to be opening your mouth and\nprove it in public all the time, right?\n\n393\n00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:26.270\nAnd you could extrapolate that and insert\ncertain adjectives around the word idiot,\n\n394\n00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:30.020\nand other adjectives come to mind,\nthere are idiot and other things, right?\n\n395\n00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.010\nMy point is very simply this.\n\n396\n00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:36.800\nThe reality is I know,\nbecause I've been doing this long enough,\n\n397\n00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.780\nwhat the outcomes are gonna be\nregardless of decisions you make.\n\n398\n00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:43.030\nI don't need to remind you after\nthe fact that you made a mistake,\n\n399\n00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:44.730\nthose people know that already.\n\n400\n00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:48.430\nThe smart security professional is the\nperson that understands how to take that\n\n401\n00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:51.610\ndialog Into a positive\ndirection over time and\n\n402\n00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:54.870\nshow the decision makers had\nto be better the next time.\n\n403\n00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:57.600\nI can remind you all the time you\nscrewed up and made a mistake.\n\n404\n00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.970\nBut all I´m gonna do is create\nan enemy going forward and\n\n405\n00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:01.790\ncreate an antagonistic relationship,\nright?\n\n406\n00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:04.790\nRight, whereas what I\nneed is I need a partner\n\n407\n00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:07.980\nin the ability to be able to go forward\nand minimize risk in the business.\n\n408\n00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:11.250\nAnd as an incident handler,\nI have to build those relationships and\n\n409\n00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:14.645\nI have to build partnerships in order\nto make the business more secure,\n\n410\n00:21:14.645 --> 00:21:16.805\nthat's the job of\nthe security professional.\n\n411\n00:21:16.805 --> 00:21:18.855\nI have to minimize risks,\nthis is all that GRC.\n\n412\n00:21:18.855 --> 00:21:23.745\nGovernance Risk and Compliance activities,\nand if I'm not able to minimize risk,\n\n413\n00:21:23.745 --> 00:21:26.585\nbecause let's make sure we\nunderstand each other right?\n\n414\n00:21:26.585 --> 00:21:28.145\nAnd hopefully Daniel\nwill agree with me and\n\n415\n00:21:28.145 --> 00:21:32.105\nI'm sure he will, that there's no such\nthing as a zero risk solution right?\n\n416\n00:21:32.105 --> 00:21:35.170\nThere's never a way to get\nto no risk in the business,\n\n417\n00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:36.850\nthere's always what we call residual risk,\nright?\n\n418\n00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:39.840\nOr remnant risk that's left\nover in anything we do.\n\n419\n00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.230\nSo the reality is, by the way,\n\n420\n00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:44.662\nthat was the place where you\nwere supposed to agree with me.\n\n421\n00:21:44.662 --> 00:21:46.293\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was shaking\nmy head in agreement.\n\n422\n00:21:46.293 --> 00:21:48.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, he was off camera,\nyou just didn't see it.\n\n423\n00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:51.500\nBut I just want that affirmation for\neverybody out there who knows you're still\n\n424\n00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:55.270\nhere, because they see me talking,\nbut they don't see you very often.\n\n425\n00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:57.280\nBut Daniel was, all kidding aside,\nshaking his and\n\n426\n00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.860\nagreeing with me while I was saying that.\n\n427\n00:21:58.860 --> 00:21:59.965\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is such an important\n\n428\n00:21:59.965 --> 00:22:00.775\nconcept, right?\n\n429\n00:22:00.775 --> 00:22:04.435\nGovernance, risk and compliance is\nall about making sure we minimize,\n\n430\n00:22:04.435 --> 00:22:06.192\nmitigate risk to a minimum level.\n\n431\n00:22:06.192 --> 00:22:09.910\nNot get rid of it all, if anybody tells\nyou you're friendly, run away from them.\n\n432\n00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:12.087\nThey're idiots, they don't know\nwhat they're talking about and\n\n433\n00:22:12.087 --> 00:22:14.264\nthey're lying to you\n&gt;&gt; They'll sell you a bridge in a few\n\n434\n00:22:14.264 --> 00:22:16.497\nminutes\n&gt;&gt; They'll sell you two bridges and\n\n435\n00:22:16.497 --> 00:22:18.160\na reality TV show on top of it.\n\n436\n00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.447\n[LAUGH] Right?\nThey'll do both.\n\n437\n00:22:19.447 --> 00:22:22.715\nBut this is the reality,\nright, we have to understand,\n\n438\n00:22:22.715 --> 00:22:24.837\nthere is no way to get rid of all risk.\n\n439\n00:22:24.837 --> 00:22:28.323\nI've never seen a solution all the years\nthat I've been doing this that equal zero\n\n440\n00:22:28.323 --> 00:22:31.810\nrisk because there's always unknown\nquantities you cannot account for.\n\n441\n00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:35.146\nThat will appear as part of just\nthe general running of that system that we\n\n442\n00:22:35.146 --> 00:22:37.016\nhave no way of anticipating how to time.\n\n443\n00:22:37.016 --> 00:22:41.443\nAnd so as a result we have to be focus on\nunderstanding how to control what we know\n\n444\n00:22:41.443 --> 00:22:44.478\nand anticipating what we\ncan realistically assume.\n\n445\n00:22:44.478 --> 00:22:47.487\nAnd then being prepared to respond\nto whatever is unknown but\n\n446\n00:22:47.487 --> 00:22:49.480\nwill happened guaranteed, right?\n\n447\n00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.720\nNo matter what, go to sleep tonight\nknowing that's something unusual and\n\n448\n00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.880\nunbeknownst to you is gonna occur,\nwhen you show up at work the next day and\n\n449\n00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.150\nyou'll be better prepared.\n\n450\n00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:59.510\nI often your my students and\nI tell the kids at this as well,\n\n451\n00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:02.420\nyou can plan to be successful or\nyou can plan to fail.\n\n452\n00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:06.450\nThe choice is yours if you want to plan\nto be successful at doing what we do you\n\n453\n00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:09.720\nneed to understand that you have\nto be prepared for the unknown.\n\n454\n00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.510\nIf you want to plan to fail, assume you\nknow everything and everything is good,\n\n455\n00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:14.000\nand it's never gonna change.\n\n456\n00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:14.520\nI've got this,\n\n457\n00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.975\nit's under control, those are the people\nthat scare me quite honestly, right?\n\n458\n00:23:17.975 --> 00:23:20.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not the people that are sitting around\n\n459\n00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.240\nwaiting for the other shoe to drop,\n\n460\n00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.850\nthose are the people I wanna hang out\nwith cuz those are people that get it.\n\n461\n00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:28.340\nThey know that something is gonna happen\nand they have to be on the lookout and\n\n462\n00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:29.710\nbe prepared for when it does.\n\n463\n00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:32.970\nThe people that think everything is good,\nthose are the people that are really,\n\n464\n00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:33.870\nreally scary.\n\n465\n00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:36.100\nBecause they just don't understand\nthat things are not good.\n\n466\n00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's the whole burying\nyour head in the sand mentality.\n\n467\n00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:41.880\nI don't see any problem, so\ntherefore there is no problem.\n\n468\n00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.320\nThat's not the best way\nto go about things.\n\n469\n00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:44.010\n&gt;&gt; No, there's a lot of problems,\n\n470\n00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:46.780\nthey're just happening around me while\nyou've got your head buried in the sand.\n\n471\n00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:49.469\nYou're just not seeing them but\nthere are lots of problems, right?\n\n472\n00:23:49.469 --> 00:23:52.351\nSo what are some of the possible examples\nof things that could be used for\n\n473\n00:23:52.351 --> 00:23:53.322\ninformation warfare?\n\n474\n00:23:53.322 --> 00:23:55.931\nWe've been talking about\ninformation warfare, cyber warfare.\n\n475\n00:23:55.931 --> 00:23:59.577\nYeah I know there's a list of things I put\ntogether in the show notes that you can\n\n476\n00:23:59.577 --> 00:24:03.223\ncertainly take a look at but think of any\nkind of malware as probably the classic\n\n477\n00:24:03.223 --> 00:24:06.452\nexample, viruses, Trojans, worms,\nspyware, bots you name it.\n\n478\n00:24:06.452 --> 00:24:07.900\nAll the stuff today.\n\n479\n00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:08.760\nAny of that kind of stuff.\n\n480\n00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:11.070\nRoot kits, real nasty, form of malware.\n\n481\n00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:14.880\nAny or all of these are examples of\ninformation warfare propagators, right?\n\n482\n00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:18.720\nSoftware that can spread information\nwarfare from one system to another.\n\n483\n00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:21.930\nAll you have to do is just look at\nthe headlines of all the things that\n\n484\n00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:26.690\nare going on around us today to\nunderstand the impact these things have.\n\n485\n00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:29.263\nThere's so\nmany examples of systems being hacked or\n\n486\n00:24:29.263 --> 00:24:31.953\nbeing modified with illegitimate\nsoftware that leads\n\n487\n00:24:31.953 --> 00:24:35.528\nto another propagation of some sort\nof an attack factor somewhere else.\n\n488\n00:24:35.528 --> 00:24:39.700\nSo these are classic examples and warning\nsigns you wanna be on the lookout for.\n\n489\n00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:42.490\nWhat about the pillars of\ninformation security management?\n\n490\n00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:43.862\nWhat are those pillars,\n\n491\n00:24:43.862 --> 00:24:48.380\nthose bedrock things that we build all of\nour information security knowledge on?\n\n492\n00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:51.500\nThere are three items we talk about\nno matter what the conversation is,\n\n493\n00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.850\nno matter what the topic is,\nno matter what the certification may be.\n\n494\n00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:57.930\nThese are standards, and\nthey are the same no matter where we go.\n\n495\n00:24:57.930 --> 00:24:58.794\nWant to help me out with these, big guy?\n\n496\n00:24:58.794 --> 00:24:59.835\nWhat are they?\n&gt;&gt; I'm guessing\n\n497\n00:24:59.835 --> 00:25:04.265\nyou're going toward the CIA triad,\nthe whole confidentiality, integrity, and,\n\n498\n00:25:04.265 --> 00:25:06.367\nwhat's the other one, availability.\n\n499\n00:25:06.367 --> 00:25:07.757\n&gt;&gt; And availability,\nwhich you almost missed.\n\n500\n00:25:07.757 --> 00:25:09.112\n&gt;&gt; I almost missed.\n&gt;&gt; Because you were not prepared to you.\n\n501\n00:25:09.112 --> 00:25:10.925\nYou almost did not have it available.\n\n502\n00:25:10.925 --> 00:25:12.793\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But confidentiality integrity and\n\n503\n00:25:12.793 --> 00:25:13.509\navailability.\n\n504\n00:25:13.509 --> 00:25:17.810\nSo let's define those terms,\nbecause these are super important, right?\n\n505\n00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:21.980\nSuper important in terms of\nthe knowledge that the classic\n\n506\n00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:26.320\ninformation security professional\nIT Professional needs to have.\n\n507\n00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:29.060\nConfidentiality, the idea\nof essentially keeping good\n\n508\n00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:30.760\ndata away from bad people, right?\n\n509\n00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:31.680\nAnd I mean, it's more than that, but\n\n510\n00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:34.080\nI'm oversimplifying\nthe definition just generically.\n\n511\n00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:37.443\nWe keep information that has been\nidentified as being important,\n\n512\n00:25:37.443 --> 00:25:40.756\nassets that have been classified\nas being in need of protection.\n\n513\n00:25:40.756 --> 00:25:45.739\nWe focus on them, we apply countermeasures\nand controls to ensure that they will be\n\n514\n00:25:45.739 --> 00:25:49.741\nkept away from people not authorized\nto see or interact with them.\n\n515\n00:25:49.741 --> 00:25:53.228\nSo confidentiality protections\nare all about keeping data or\n\n516\n00:25:53.228 --> 00:25:57.540\nassets away from people that are not\nauthorized to interact with them.\n\n517\n00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:00.520\nWe usually implement this protection\nthrough counter measures and\n\n518\n00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.980\ncontrols that take the form of\nencryption more often than not.\n\n519\n00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:07.677\nNumber one way, we implement\nconfidentiality protections, would be to\n\n520\n00:26:07.677 --> 00:26:11.851\nencrypt data, because it assures beyond\nany reasonable doubt that the data even if\n\n521\n00:26:11.851 --> 00:26:15.505\nfalls into the hands of the bad actor\nwill be unlikely to be compromised.\n\n522\n00:26:15.505 --> 00:26:19.413\nAnd we'll talk more about why that maybe\nthe case in upcoming conversations with\n\n523\n00:26:19.413 --> 00:26:21.420\nregards to how encryption works.\n\n524\n00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:25.721\nSo confidentiality,\nkeeping good data away from bad people.\n\n525\n00:26:25.721 --> 00:26:27.250\nWhat about integrity?\n\n526\n00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:30.070\nIntegrity is the idea of\nessentially change management.\n\n527\n00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:31.220\nChange control, right?\n\n528\n00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:34.371\nMaking sure that data is not\nmodified without the knowledge and\n\n529\n00:26:34.371 --> 00:26:37.521\nconsent of the data owner and\nof course, with the knowledge and\n\n530\n00:26:37.521 --> 00:26:39.135\nconsent of the data custodian.\n\n531\n00:26:39.135 --> 00:26:41.913\nWho implements the requirements for\naccess and\n\n532\n00:26:41.913 --> 00:26:46.502\naccess control around confidentiality\non behalf of the owners we specified.\n\n533\n00:26:46.502 --> 00:26:49.753\nSo if you think of integrity as\nessentially change control for\n\n534\n00:26:49.753 --> 00:26:53.752\ndata, what we're talking about is\nensuring, and a change by the way in this\n\n535\n00:26:53.752 --> 00:26:57.064\ncase is defined as any activity\nthat leads to an add, a remove,\n\n536\n00:26:57.064 --> 00:26:59.287\nor a modify of the data in some way.\n\n537\n00:26:59.287 --> 00:27:03.287\nAdd new data to the existing data, modify\nexisting data, remove existing data.\n\n538\n00:27:03.287 --> 00:27:07.840\nAdd, remove or modify is how we\ndefine change and change activities.\n\n539\n00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:11.510\nChange activities around data without\nthe knowledge of consent of ownership and\n\n540\n00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:12.240\nwithout the knowledge and\n\n541\n00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:16.460\nconsent of the custodian is\nclassified as breaking integrity.\n\n542\n00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.220\nThe way we implement\nintegrity controls and\n\n543\n00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:22.250\ncountermeasures, classic examples will\nbe things like digitally signing or\n\n544\n00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:25.700\ndigital signatures associated\nwith the validation of files.\n\n545\n00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:29.220\nHashing would be another example\nof an integrity control.\n\n546\n00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.277\nAvailability, the idea of\nensuring that the data,\n\n547\n00:27:32.277 --> 00:27:37.211\nthe assets that we've have talked about,\nthat need to be available, that need to be\n\n548\n00:27:37.211 --> 00:27:41.882\naccessible to the authorized users that\nneed to see and interact with the data.\n\n549\n00:27:41.882 --> 00:27:47.032\nWill be there during the authorized\naccess times or windows that we have said\n\n550\n00:27:47.032 --> 00:27:52.722\nusers between the standard business hours\nof nine to five can access this data.\n\n551\n00:27:52.722 --> 00:27:56.002\nWell, availability then is focused on\nensuring that the data is going to be\n\n552\n00:27:56.002 --> 00:27:57.835\nthere between the hours of nine and five.\n\n553\n00:27:57.835 --> 00:27:59.790\nBut it's more than that, it's broader.\n\n554\n00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:01.790\nIt's not just accessibility to data.\n\n555\n00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:06.221\nIt's the thought process of architect in\nredundancy into our systems that ensures\n\n556\n00:28:06.221 --> 00:28:08.130\nthat every level, at every layer.\n\n557\n00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:11.168\nThat all the supporting elements,\nhardware, software, and\n\n558\n00:28:11.168 --> 00:28:14.834\nall the things in between that have to\nbe there for that data to be available,\n\n559\n00:28:14.834 --> 00:28:16.380\nwill indeed be working.\n\n560\n00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:20.730\nRedundant power supplies,\nredundant network paths, redundant systems\n\n561\n00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:24.980\nof a variety of types so that if one thing\nwere to fail, something else steps in and\n\n562\n00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:28.510\ncontinues and creates continuity\nof that service and system.\n\n563\n00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:31.420\nSo we think about things like\nensuring that we have more\n\n564\n00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:33.750\nthan one domain controller\nin case one were to fail.\n\n565\n00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:35.670\nWe have backup power supplies and\n\n566\n00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:39.750\nback up generators in case those power\nsupplies fail because they run down.\n\n567\n00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:40.910\nWe have dual network cards.\n\n568\n00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:41.651\nWe have dual power supplies.\n\n569\n00:28:41.651 --> 00:28:43.456\nWe have all sorts of duality and\n\n570\n00:28:43.456 --> 00:28:47.920\nall sorts of redundancy built into\nour systems around availability.\n\n571\n00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:49.799\nSo, as Daniel said, the CIA triad,\n\n572\n00:28:49.799 --> 00:28:53.925\nthe iron triangle is what you often hear\nit referred to as as well, of information\n\n573\n00:28:53.925 --> 00:28:57.888\nsecurity is about these three pillars\nof information security management.\n\n574\n00:28:57.888 --> 00:29:00.490\nConfidentiality, integrity and\navailability.\n\n575\n00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:03.900\nYou need to know them, you need to\nunderstand them, you need to embrace them.\n\n576\n00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:07.310\nBut most importantly if asked,\nyou need to be able to define them.\n\n577\n00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:10.270\nAs surprising as that may be\nat certain points in time.\n\n578\n00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:13.430\nRemember you may at some point be\nthinking, well I'd like to actually become\n\n579\n00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:17.860\ncertified as ECIH as an EC Counsel\nIncident Handler and if you are going to\n\n580\n00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:20.840\ngo down that road, and I would encourage\nall of you to think about doing that.\n\n581\n00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:24.140\nIf you're going to do that you need to\nensure that you can answer question about\n\n582\n00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:25.690\nall the things were talking about and\n\n583\n00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:29.255\ncertainly speak knowledgeably about the\ntopics that we bring up for conversation.\n\n584\n00:29:29.255 --> 00:29:32.400\nBut especially things like vocabulary\nterms that we spend time going\n\n585\n00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.274\nthrough with you.\n\n586\n00:29:33.274 --> 00:29:35.930\nThat we go out of our way to\nmake sure we define for you.\n\n587\n00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:39.562\nThose are fair game on exams, and\nI would not be surprised if you were asked\n\n588\n00:29:39.562 --> 00:29:43.548\nquestions about those kinds of definitions\nand how to apply those definitions to\n\n589\n00:29:43.548 --> 00:29:47.195\na variety of circumstances and\nscenarios in a variety of different ways.\n\n590\n00:29:47.195 --> 00:29:50.300\nSo you do wanna make sure\nyou're comfortable with the and\n\n591\n00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:51.880\nthink through the logic.\n\n592\n00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.362\nOf that thought process as we,\n\n593\n00:29:53.362 --> 00:29:56.269\nnot only wrap up our conversations\nin this particular area.\n\n594\n00:29:56.269 --> 00:30:00.118\nBut more broadly as we continue to have\nthem around these topics offer you other\n\n595\n00:30:00.118 --> 00:30:03.968\ndefinitions and other thought processes\nwill be equally important to you with\n\n596\n00:30:03.968 --> 00:30:05.555\nregards being successful.\n\n597\n00:30:05.555 --> 00:30:07.205\n&gt;&gt; That's right, it does help\nwhen we're all speaking the same\n\n598\n00:30:07.205 --> 00:30:07.976\nlanguage, right, folks.\n\n599\n00:30:07.976 --> 00:30:10.043\nThat the terms of\ndefinitions that I'm using,\n\n600\n00:30:10.043 --> 00:30:12.585\nthat Adam's using are the same\nones that you understand.\n\n601\n00:30:12.585 --> 00:30:15.175\nAnd we're gonna continue\nto lay those foundations.\n\n602\n00:30:15.175 --> 00:30:18.680\nPour the concrete truck over here and\ngive you some more foundational knowledge.\n\n603\n00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.645\nBut we're not gonna be able\nto do it in this episode.\n\n604\n00:30:20.645 --> 00:30:22.125\nWe are out of time.\n\n605\n00:30:22.125 --> 00:30:23.728\nWe do appreciate you\nguys joining us today.\n\n606\n00:30:23.728 --> 00:30:28.497\nAdam, we always appreciate you stopping\nby but like I said, it is that time for\n\n607\n00:30:28.497 --> 00:30:32.713\nus to sign off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n608\n00:30:32.713 --> 00:30:35.867\n&gt;&gt; I'm an iron triangle,\nfull of information security.\n\n609\n00:30:35.867 --> 00:30:37.163\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n610\n00:30:37.163 --> 00:30:37.671\n&gt;&gt; Take care.\n\n611\n00:30:37.671 --> 00:30:40.285\n&gt;&gt; Bye.\n\n612\n00:30:40.285 --> 00:30:46.306\n[MUSIC]\n\n613\n00:30:46.306 --> 00:30:49.341\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

episode of ITPRO.TV\n&gt;&gt; I'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n6\n00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.260\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.300\nwe are back with more on our EC Council\ncertified incident handler series.\n\n8\n00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.150\nAnd of course joining us\nback in the studio again,\n\n9\n00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.950\ncontinuing on our conversation on\nour introduction to that very topic,\n\n10\n00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.490\nour good friend Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.420\nAdam we're glad to have you back,\nhow's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.520\nIt is going well.\n\n13\n00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.330\nI would hazard a guess to say\nspectacularly, but we'll.\n\n14\n00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.870\n&gt;&gt; Leave that to you to decide after\nwe get done with this conversation.\n\n15\n00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.560\nSo, we're gonna continue\nwhere we left off.\n\n16\n00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.170\nWe were defining some vocabulary terms for\n\n17\n00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.580\nyou last time we had the pleasure\nof spending time with you.\n\n18\n00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.600\nWe're gonna pick up on that concept\nfrom the confidentiality, integrity and\n\n19\n00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.360\navailability conversation we had and\nbroaden that conversation out to what goes\n\n20\n00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.700\non beyond Just CIA, out beyond\nthe boundary of the iron triangle.\n\n21\n00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.920\nWe have to think about an acronym,\nand it's not an acronym per say,\n\n22\n00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.240\nit's just a way for you to remember all\nof terms we're about to throw at you.\n\n23\n00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.090\nBut I like to think of it as arttv,\nartt a-r-t-t-v as in ARTTV.\n\n24\n00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.730\n&gt;&gt; ARTTV.\n\n25\n00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.030\nNot RV, but ARTTV.\n\n26\n00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.500\nAlmost the same thing.\n\n27\n00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.960\nBut ARTTV stands for attack, risk,\nthreat, threat source, and vulnerability.\n\n28\n00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.710\nWe're gonna define those five,\nfive terms for\n\n29\n00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.650\nyou here, as part of\nthe discussion around vocabulary.\n\n30\n00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.440\nThat is important as we've\ntalked about for you to master,\n\n31\n00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.330\nand to be comfortable with.\n\n32\n00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.390\nIn order to understand how to\nspeak the same language, and\n\n33\n00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.600\nbeyond the same page as reminded\nus about in our last conversation.\n\n34\n00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.630\nSo, let's think about\nthe concept of an attack.\n\n35\n00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.760\nAn attack is a deliberate action.\n\n36\n00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.070\nOne that takes place with premeditation.\n\n37\n00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.710\nSomething somebody has to go out,\nthink about, plan for, and\n\n38\n00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.160\nthen ultimately execute.\n\n39\n00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.460\nIt is typically negative, so\n\n40\n00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.590\nit more often than not causes harm\n&gt;&gt; Which would be an important\n\n41\n00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.790\nthought process for\nus to engage in as well.\n\n42\n00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.120\nWhen we think about\nattacking a computer system,\n\n43\n00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.460\nwe focus the activity on\nan information system of some kind.\n\n44\n00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.650\nThat attack is seeking to do harm to\na computer system and/or to the assets,\n\n45\n00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.330\nthe data, and the other assets\nassociated with that computer system.\n\n46\n00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.240\n&gt;&gt; By exploiting what is referred\nto as a known vulnerability.\n\n47\n00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.170\nA vulnerability you will\ncome to find is a weakness.\n\n48\n00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.540\nSo, we're exploiting\nweaknesses in the system, and\n\n49\n00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.140\nseeking to do so\nin some sort of threatening way.\n\n50\n00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.740\nWe, in other words,\n\n51\n00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.400\nare violating the security of that\nsystem in order to be able to attack it.\n\n52\n00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.530\nAnd that's what an attack is defined as.\n\n53\n00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.490\nIt's an act of aggression looking to do\nharm and then to do harm against one or\n\n54\n00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.160\nmore assets by exploiting weaknesses,\n\n55\n00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.990\nexploiting vulnerabilities that\nare found within the system.\n\n56\n00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.680\nA risk, the idea of risk, want to devote\nsome conversation time to risk in upcoming\n\n57\n00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.950\nconversations, but a risk generally is\nreally the way we measure the extent,\n\n58\n00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.280\nor measure the thought process around\nthe likelihood that something,\n\n59\n00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.480\nwhatever the target of the activity\nthat's negative, the attack,\n\n60\n00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.400\nwill be, so typically\nthe computer system or the asset.\n\n61\n00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.790\nMeasure the extent to which the entity or\n\n62\n00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.070\nthe target it threatened by\npotential circumstances or\n\n63\n00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.680\nsome sort of event, and is usually\nmade up of two specific functions,\n\n64\n00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.240\nthe adverse impact that would arise If\nthat attack or event were to occur so\n\n65\n00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.910\nin other words the negative outcome and\nthe likelihood that it is going to occur.\n\n66\n00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.850\nAnd so when we think about risk we think\nabout how likely is it that the negative\n\n67\n00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.020\noutcome is going to occur, and how badly\nis it gonna hurt us when it does, right?\n\n68\n00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.580\nYou know some risks are minimal in nature,\nright.\n\n69\n00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.420\nThere's a risk that while standing here,\nwell I'm actually leaning in theory.\n\n70\n00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.540\nBut while spending time with you here at\nthe pulpit, at the podium talking to you,\n\n71\n00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.870\ncuz I like to lean when I talk.\n\n72\n00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.960\nIt's a little bit easier for me.\n\n73\n00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.780\nSo, if I wasn't so tall I wouldn't\nhave to lean to be on camera.\n\n74\n00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.530\nIf I was shorter I could just stand up and\nit wouldn't be a problem.\n\n75\n00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:53.500\nBut because I am so\n\n76\n00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.120\nshort to begin with leaning makes it\neven tougher to show up on camera.\n\n77\n00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.750\nSo, when we talk about this and\nwe think about for instance the threat,\n\n78\n00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.190\nthe potential risk associated with\nleaning, I could be leaning here and\n\n79\n00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.900\nmaybe knock the podium over right.\n\n80\n00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.400\nI could clean on it and push it and\nmaybe it comes out of the floor that it's\n\n81\n00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.800\nmounted to here, and go slide and\nacross and bangs on the wall over there.\n\n82\n00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.780\nOur computers go with it and\nof course here,\n\n83\n00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.070\nhandy little ITPRO.TV mug goes with it\nas well and we have water on the floor.\n\n84\n00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.650\nThat would be our potential\nnegative outcome, right.\n\n85\n00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.040\nBut, as risks go it's probably pretty\nminimal one cuz this thing is anchoring\n\n86\n00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.180\npretty well into the concrete here,\nit's not going anywhere, right?\n\n87\n00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.690\nIt's more likely that something like\na loud noise from outside That would be\n\n88\n00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.340\nthe perfect cue for the garbage truck\nto show up and start shaking the bin.\n\n89\n00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.350\nSome sort of noise from outside may\ninterrupt our ability to be able to talk\n\n90\n00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.070\nand therefore cause us to have to\nredo this conversation with you,\n\n91\n00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.760\nbut we're not going to have a dramatic\npause while that happens because\n\n92\n00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.930\nwe've taken steps to ensure that\nthat's not going to be the case.\n\n93\n00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.410\nBut the risk is the idea that if that did\noccur, how negative would that impact be?\n\n94\n00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.210\nWould it lead to the destruction of\nour ability to communicate with you?\n\n95\n00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.570\nAnd have this conversation?\n\n96\n00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.900\nAnd maybe for\nyou to understand the vocabulary?\n\n97\n00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:03.520\nCould.\n\n98\n00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.820\nWould it lead to a delay in our ability\nto send this information out to you?\n\n99\n00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.410\nIt may, but\nthen how likely is it to occur?\n\n100\n00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.220\nWell we've been waiting,\nthere's been no loud noise.\n\n101\n00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.310\nProbably not very likely.\n\n102\n00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:13.290\nThankfully, right.\n\n103\n00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.440\nSo, when we think about risk,\nwe have to measure likelihood And\n\n104\n00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.440\nwe have to measure impact of occurrence.\n\n105\n00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.980\nWe talked about probability impact and\n\n106\n00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.500\nexposure a lot with risk,\nwhat's called pie, P-I-E.\n\n107\n00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.210\nThe idea of a pie probability impact\nexposure matrix is the idea of measuring\n\n108\n00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.980\nwhen risks will happen,\nhow likely they are to occur, and\n\n109\n00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.150\nif they do occur, how much are they\ngonna negatively impact us?\n\n110\n00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.750\nAnd, we could look at\nthis in different ways.\n\n111\n00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.190\nWe'll talk about Probability and\nexposure and impact later.\n\n112\n00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.060\nBut we also talk about something I\nmentioned in a prior conversation,\n\n113\n00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.650\nwhich is a risk assessment and\n\n114\n00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.050\nthe way we measure potential\nliability associated with risk.\n\n115\n00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.820\nAnd how much risk we're\nwilling to take on and\n\n116\n00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.200\nmanage is through doing a risk assessment.\n\n117\n00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.540\nHow we may look at different ways of doing\nthat and different ways of understanding.\n\n118\n00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.960\nThe risks associated with us.\n\n119\n00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.310\nYou do this all the time if you think\nabout what you do on a daily basis.\n\n120\n00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.580\nGetting out of bed in\nthe morning is a risky activity.\n\n121\n00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:03.710\nYou have to assess whether or\n\n122\n00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.790\nnot that you're gonna like the outcome of\nwaking up and going to work every day.\n\n123\n00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.330\nAnd more of us thought more about that,\nthe answer may be, not so much,\n\n124\n00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.610\nwe spend more time in bed.\n\n125\n00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.270\nBut driving to work is a risky activity,\nright?\n\n126\n00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.550\nBeing on the road today can lead\nto negative outcomes if you really\n\n127\n00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:18.070\nthink about that.\n\n128\n00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.170\n&gt;&gt; You've been here before.\n\n129\n00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.770\n&gt;&gt; I have been here before, I have.\n\n130\n00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.260\nAnd I've driven here before so\n\n131\n00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.330\nI can certainly speak first hand and\nknowledgeably about such activities.\n\n132\n00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.360\nI also live in a major metropolitan\narea and I can speak to you.\n\n133\n00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.300\nExtensively without driving there, and\nhow much fun it is, as many of you,\n\n134\n00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.890\nI'm sure, will be aware of as well.\n\n135\n00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.240\nYou know if we just got\nrid of cell phones.\n\n136\n00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.710\n&gt;&gt; It would do a lot for\nthe good of the traffic.\n\n137\n00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.020\n&gt;&gt; It would make the likelihood of risk\noccurring while you're driving a lot less.\n\n138\n00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.190\n&gt;&gt; I like how you think, sir.\n\n139\n00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.465\n&gt;&gt; I just-\n&gt;&gt; I'm just saying.\n\n140\n00:06:43.465 --> 00:06:46.435\nPhones may be smart, but people that use\nthem are definitely not all the time.\n\n141\n00:06:46.435 --> 00:06:49.235\n&gt;&gt; All in favor of removing the cell\nphones from driving, say aye.\n\n142\n00:06:49.235 --> 00:06:50.595\nAye.\n&gt;&gt; I would vote for that.\n\n143\n00:06:50.595 --> 00:06:51.245\n&gt;&gt; The ayes have it.\n\n144\n00:06:51.245 --> 00:06:52.355\nMotion passes, right?\n\n145\n00:06:52.355 --> 00:06:54.122\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't care if they're voice\n\n146\n00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:54.829\nactivated or not.\n\n147\n00:06:54.829 --> 00:06:58.109\nThere's absolutely no reason you should\nbe using one while you are operating\n\n148\n00:06:58.109 --> 00:07:00.220\na vehicle moving at a great rate of speed.\n\n149\n00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.350\nEspecially heavy I mean if you're\ndriving a like a little trike or\n\n150\n00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:05.770\nsomething like a little hot wheels car.\n\n151\n00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.440\n&gt;&gt; It's not gonna do a lot of damage\nagain it goes back to the risk.\n\n152\n00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.060\nRight?\n\n153\n00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.670\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n154\n00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:13.450\nWhat I'd risk and also the scale of impact\nspecifically the risk this is one of\n\n155\n00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:14.570\nthe things we gotta think about.\n\n156\n00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.470\nBy the way for those of you that are new\nto the Daniel and Adam experience\n\n157\n00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.800\nwe do have this random from asides\ntime time in our conversations.\n\n158\n00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.920\nBut I promise you,\nwe ultimately bring it back.\n\n159\n00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.380\nWe get to where we're going,\nas we're about to right now.\n\n160\n00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:31.710\nSo, we've talked about ad attack and\nrisk as part of the art conversation.\n\n161\n00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:34.310\nWhat about the two t's threat and\nthreat source?\n\n162\n00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.850\nSo threats, right,\nare something we have to think about.\n\n163\n00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:38.190\nWe've talked about risk, right.\n\n164\n00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.540\nBut threat,\nthe idea that the circumstance or\n\n165\n00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.740\nevent we're gonna be monitoring that\nwe're looking at that We potentially\n\n166\n00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.540\nare concerned about is going\nto adversely impact us.\n\n167\n00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:49.960\nIn otherwards, the threat that this\nis going to have negative impact and\n\n168\n00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.900\nconsequence right,\nis part of what we have to consider.\n\n169\n00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.090\nIt can impact negatively the asset,\nan individual business,\n\n170\n00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:59.655\nany combination of those things,\nand or all of those things, right?\n\n171\n00:07:59.655 --> 00:08:03.588\nAnd also in addition, most likely\nto lead to a denial of service or\n\n172\n00:08:03.588 --> 00:08:04.742\ninability to use.\n\n173\n00:08:04.742 --> 00:08:06.040\n'The asset in some way.\n\n174\n00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:12.320\nSo the threat is really the measure of\nhow likely something is to occur, right.\n\n175\n00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.030\nYou know when we think about this,\n\n176\n00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:19.420\nright, any negative consequence\nthat will come out of an activity,\n\n177\n00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:23.460\nthat is going to impact us in some\nway is potentially threatening to us.\n\n178\n00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:28.000\nAnd people will often kind of intermingle\nand co-mingle these two terms, right?\n\n179\n00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.870\nThey will say, well risk and threat,\nit's kind of the same thing,\n\n180\n00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.020\nit's really, more or\nless they're related to each other.\n\n181\n00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.930\nAbsolutely, they are,\nthere's no doubt about it.\n\n182\n00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:36.940\nYou can't have one without the other,\nlet's start with that.\n\n183\n00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.900\nBut they are distinctly different,\nwe define them differently.\n\n184\n00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:43.516\nRisk is broader than just\nthe likelihood that something is\n\n185\n00:08:43.516 --> 00:08:45.618\ngonna negatively impact us.\n\n186\n00:08:45.618 --> 00:08:49.505\nRight, the threat is the likelihood that\nsomething's gonna negatively happen to us.\n\n187\n00:08:49.505 --> 00:08:53.185\nRisk is the threat of the likelihood\nthat something will happen but\n\n188\n00:08:53.185 --> 00:08:56.295\nit is also the consequence\nassociated with that happening.\n\n189\n00:08:56.295 --> 00:09:00.565\nAnd the measurement of those two things\nreally is what we pair together with risk.\n\n190\n00:09:00.565 --> 00:09:01.985\nThreat source, the intent and\n\n191\n00:09:01.985 --> 00:09:06.545\nmethod targeted at the intentional\nexploitation of a vulnerability.\n\n192\n00:09:06.545 --> 00:09:09.785\nLet me talk formal in an info speak for\na minute.\n\n193\n00:09:09.785 --> 00:09:10.765\nThe idea, in other words,\n\n194\n00:09:10.765 --> 00:09:15.090\nin plain old fashioned language that\n[COUGH] the way in which we go about\n\n195\n00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:19.270\nexecuting this attack, creating\nthe negative consequence and outcome.\n\n196\n00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:23.140\nAnd the vector sometimes people will\ncall it, that we use to exploit\n\n197\n00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:26.570\nthe vulnerability, the weakness we\nfind that we take advantage of.\n\n198\n00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:29.300\nAnd the bad actor that is able to do that\n\n199\n00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.790\nis all part of what the threat\nsource really represents.\n\n200\n00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:34.650\nWhere is the threat coming from,\nthat's what the threat source points to.\n\n201\n00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:37.480\nThat's what helps us to understand,\nis it a bad actor?\n\n202\n00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.930\nIs it a system that's been overtaken,\nand either botted or\n\n203\n00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:43.050\nrouted or has some sort of malware on it?\n\n204\n00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.440\nIs there somebody controlling that,\nand if so, to what end?\n\n205\n00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.050\nThis is what the threat source\nhelps us to understand.\n\n206\n00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:51.570\nThe ability to be able to\nexploit a vulnerability.\n\n207\n00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:52.660\nAnd the actor or\n\n208\n00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:56.210\nthe entity that is taking advantage of\nthat is what the threat source represents.\n\n209\n00:09:56.210 --> 00:10:00.250\nAnd then the V in ARTV, vulnerability,\nwe've been talking about this all along.\n\n210\n00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:04.370\nThis is the weakness or\nweaknesses that we look to exploit.\n\n211\n00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:08.060\nVulnerabilities are gonna come\nin a variety of sources and\n\n212\n00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:09.540\ncome from a variety of places.\n\n213\n00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.510\nThey may be something as simple\nas a patch that was not applied\n\n214\n00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:13.190\nwhen it should've been.\n\n215\n00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:14.550\nAnd as a result or\n\n216\n00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:18.370\na consequence of that inability to\nfocus on that attention to detail,\n\n217\n00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:22.610\nwe've left open this system to compromise\nbecause we're not plugging a hole, right?\n\n218\n00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:23.670\nThat could be one thing.\n\n219\n00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:26.440\nThe vulnerability may come from\na patch that was applied, but\n\n220\n00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:30.280\nthe vendor put out a patch that for\nsome reason was bad.\n\n221\n00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.090\nAnd you applied it in good faith and\n\n222\n00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:35.400\nyou opened yourself up to a vulnerability\nbecause the patch blows up your system.\n\n223\n00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.880\nIn other words,\nyou could do all the right things and\n\n224\n00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.000\nvulnerabilities can still happen, right?\n\n225\n00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.750\nSo good things happen to good people,\ngood things happen to bad people.\n\n226\n00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:47.380\nBad things happen to good people,\nbad things happen to bad people, right.\n\n227\n00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.922\nThe reality is, stuff happens\nto people all the time, right.\n\n228\n00:10:50.922 --> 00:10:54.010\n[LAUGH] And we just gotta make sure,\nto the best of our abilities,\n\n229\n00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:58.230\nthat when it comes to vulnerabilities,\ncomes to weaknesses, we anticipate and\n\n230\n00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:01.340\nplan for as much as we can,\nas we've suggested is important to you.\n\n231\n00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:05.290\nAnd we try to minimize, and again we\ncome back to the idea of mitigation.\n\n232\n00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:09.040\nWe try to minimize the negative impact,\nthe consequence of our actions\n\n233\n00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.336\nby anticipating and planning and\ncontrolling as much as we can.\n\n234\n00:11:12.336 --> 00:11:15.950\nBut when a vendor puts out a bad patch and\nwe have no way of knowing that and\n\n235\n00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:19.670\nwe apply it, thinking it's good, there's\nnot much we can do in that situation\n\n236\n00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:22.347\nbecause essentially,\nif we held off applying the patch.\n\n237\n00:11:22.347 --> 00:11:27.500\nAnd we're late to the game, well in this\nparticular case, yeah, that would have\n\n238\n00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:31.520\nbeen a good outcome, but 99.9 times out\nof 100 that may lead to vulnerability and\n\n239\n00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.240\ncompromise anyway, but\nfor different reasons.\n\n240\n00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.250\nSo it's kind of the damned if you do,\ndamned if you don't scenario.\n\n241\n00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:39.430\nNow the good news is that\nalmost without exception,\n\n242\n00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:42.460\npatches from vendors\nare applied all the time,\n\n243\n00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:45.570\nand they almost never leave it\ncompromised because they're bad.\n\n244\n00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:49.050\nIs it likely that you'll get a bad patch,\nno, it's not very likely, but\n\n245\n00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:51.070\nis there a possibility, absolutely.\n\n246\n00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:53.720\nMathematically we can prove that,\nright, we know.\n\n247\n00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:57.990\nAny of you that have been doing this long\nenough, that have been around long enough,\n\n248\n00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:02.500\nthat remember NT 4.0, that great\nWindows operating system that it was,\n\n249\n00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.630\nif you remember NT 4.0 Service Pack 6 and\n6a.\n\n250\n00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:09.276\nAnd the debacle around Microsoft putting\nout the initial service pack and\n\n251\n00:12:09.276 --> 00:12:13.533\nthe fact every machine it touched blew up,\nwhere the blue screen of death comes from.\n\n252\n00:12:13.533 --> 00:12:17.071\nYou will know and remember that\nsometimes vendors put out bad patches.\n\n253\n00:12:17.071 --> 00:12:20.495\nAnd it's not a Microsoft thing,\nCisco's done, Citrix has done it,\n\n254\n00:12:20.495 --> 00:12:22.480\nVMware's done it, Oracle has done it.\n\n255\n00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.920\nEvery major technology vendor in\nthe planet has had at least one or\n\n256\n00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.910\nmore of these stories associated\nwith their name over the years.\n\n257\n00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:32.110\nSo this is just a technology thing,\nright, things are complex, and\n\n258\n00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:34.405\nsometimes we just don't get\nit right the first time.\n\n259\n00:12:34.405 --> 00:12:37.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if that were not the case,\nthey wouldn't have the ability to actually\n\n260\n00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:40.990\nremove the update or the packs or\nwhatever, because these things do happen.\n\n261\n00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:46.200\nWe have both worked in the industry for\nlong enough to know that\n\n262\n00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.390\nit is going to occur, this is why\nyou need to do things like testing.\n\n263\n00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:53.990\nHave a group of people out there that\nare on your bleeding edge, per se, so\n\n264\n00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:58.330\nthat they would find out these things\nbefore it goes into your systems, by and\n\n265\n00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:00.130\nlarge, blowing up the entire thing.\n\n266\n00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:02.790\nAnd we're left with the lovely\nblue screen of death everywhere,\n\n267\n00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:04.190\nthat was never a good time.\n\n268\n00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:06.080\n&gt;&gt; No, well,\nit was if it was somebody else's-\n\n269\n00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, then you could point and laugh.\n\n270\n00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:10.072\n&gt;&gt; If it happened to your friend,\nyou could laugh about it all day,\n\n271\n00:13:10.072 --> 00:13:12.100\nremember days of laughter\nat other people's expense.\n\n272\n00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.910\nThat's part of the fun of doing this but\nif it's your system,\n\n273\n00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:15.690\nit's a very serious thing.\n\n274\n00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:16.200\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n275\n00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.643\n&gt;&gt; Seriously and it should not happen.\n\n276\n00:13:17.643 --> 00:13:19.112\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Just be aware of that.\n\n277\n00:13:19.112 --> 00:13:22.275\nAll right, so we've talked about some\nof the most important vocabulary we can\n\n278\n00:13:22.275 --> 00:13:26.280\ndefined attack, certainly threat,\nthreats, or vulnerability risks.\n\n279\n00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.130\nThese are operational terms,\nyou need to understand,\n\n280\n00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:32.410\nyou need to internalize, you need to\nbe able to speak knowledgeably about.\n\n281\n00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:35.138\nYou need to be able to apply to all\nthe upcoming conversation that we're\n\n282\n00:13:35.138 --> 00:13:35.645\ngonna have.\n\n283\n00:13:35.645 --> 00:13:38.247\nIn addition, what about types\nof computer security incidents?\n\n284\n00:13:38.247 --> 00:13:41.782\nWe've defined what security incidents are,\ncomputer security incidents,\n\n285\n00:13:41.782 --> 00:13:45.635\nhaving negative consequences, outcomes\nthat we don't foresee in the system.\n\n286\n00:13:45.635 --> 00:13:47.445\nBut there are many different\ncategories and types, right,\n\n287\n00:13:47.445 --> 00:13:50.865\nthings like getting infected with malware,\nthings like unauthorized access.\n\n288\n00:13:50.865 --> 00:13:54.165\nDaniel talked about this early on,\nwhere he said this a good example,\n\n289\n00:13:54.165 --> 00:13:56.475\nlet me tell you this generic\nstory about something.\n\n290\n00:13:56.475 --> 00:13:59.495\nAnd right, he talked about the idea\nthat users are wandering around,\n\n291\n00:13:59.495 --> 00:14:02.790\nunchallenged in systems and\nthe problems that can lead to.\n\n292\n00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:06.760\nI firmly believe, a little puddle of\nwater on the floor, electrical charge,\n\n293\n00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.010\nyou don't have too many people\nwalking around unauthorized.\n\n294\n00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:10.930\nOne or two,\nyou get a little stray every so often,\n\n295\n00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:13.250\nbut generally you keep\nthe herd in place and\n\n296\n00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:15.820\nyou don't have to herd cats too much\nwhen you make examples out of people.\n\n297\n00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:19.140\n&gt;&gt; Maybe an electrical charge is\nthe proper motivation for many people.\n\n298\n00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:22.210\n&gt;&gt; Properly applied,\nelectrical stimulus can do wonders for\n\n299\n00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:23.600\nyour ability to minimize risk.\n\n300\n00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.615\nI am not suggesting by the way that this\nis appropriate behavior, let me be clear.\n\n301\n00:14:26.615 --> 00:14:28.037\n&gt;&gt; You draw you own conclusion ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n302\n00:14:28.037 --> 00:14:31.648\n&gt;&gt; We are just merely giving you\nknowledge what you do is up to you.\n\n303\n00:14:31.648 --> 00:14:33.885\nAll right so unauthorized use of services,\n\n304\n00:14:33.885 --> 00:14:36.731\nthis is a big one this happens\nall the time in companies.\n\n305\n00:14:36.731 --> 00:14:40.020\nPeople may go out and surf the Internet,\nfor instance, during work hours.\n\n306\n00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.970\nAnd while a lot of times\nthat's perfectly legitimate,\n\n307\n00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:44.650\nwhen you're streaming the World Cup\nwhen you're supposed to be working,\n\n308\n00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:47.340\nthat's probably not authorized\nuse of services, right.\n\n309\n00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:48.670\nSo this can lead to compromise,\n\n310\n00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:52.100\nthis can lead to denial of service,\nbecause you may download\n\n311\n00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.560\nsoftware that you're not supposed to have\nthat could attach to an internal resource.\n\n312\n00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:59.030\nThis could suck bandwidth out of\nthe system that is actually useful for\n\n313\n00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.390\nother things besides looking at the\nWorld Cup or whatever you may be doing.\n\n314\n00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:05.860\nI like the World Cup, by the way,\nI think it's awesome, I love football, but\n\n315\n00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:08.240\nthe reality is-\n&gt;&gt; Put it on the radio.\n\n316\n00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.090\n&gt;&gt; No,\nI think it's perfectly legitimate for\n\n317\n00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:13.530\nyou to look at those things I just don't,\nas we would all agree,\n\n318\n00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:16.300\nall kidding aside, that you should do so\nduring working hours.\n\n319\n00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:19.540\nOn corporate assets when there's a policy\nthat says you're not supposed to,\n\n320\n00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:22.720\nthen you're violating the policy and\nyou're acting inappropriately.\n\n321\n00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:26.470\nEspionage, fraud and theft,\nemployee sabotage, denial or\n\n322\n00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:28.420\ndistributed denial of service of attacks.\n\n323\n00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:33.360\nThese are all examples of things that\ncan go horribly wrong and that as\n\n324\n00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:37.780\nincident handlers, we may get called\non to have to address and deal with.\n\n325\n00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:40.810\nAnd one of the ways we aggregate\nthis information, think about it,\n\n326\n00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:44.170\nand better understand it, is by looking\nat some of the trends in our industry.\n\n327\n00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:45.640\nSo if we can go to my machine for\n\n328\n00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.250\na minute, wanna talk about trending\nwith you for a minute or two.\n\n329\n00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:51.117\nWanna show you a couple of\ninteresting things that may or\n\n330\n00:15:51.117 --> 00:15:53.195\nmay not be things that you're aware of.\n\n331\n00:15:53.195 --> 00:15:56.149\nYeah, we're gonna go out and search\nthe web as they will, or as they say, and\n\n332\n00:15:56.149 --> 00:15:58.795\nuse the oracle of the Internet,\nI love referring to Google that way.\n\n333\n00:15:58.795 --> 00:16:00.638\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They should rebrand themselves Forget\n\n334\n00:16:00.638 --> 00:16:01.349\nthis ABC garbage.\n\n335\n00:16:01.349 --> 00:16:04.398\nThey should call themselves the oracle\nof the internet because I think they've\n\n336\n00:16:04.398 --> 00:16:05.420\nearned that title.\n\n337\n00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:06.450\nThey know everything about everything.\n\n338\n00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:07.470\n&gt;&gt; You should go trademark that.\n\n339\n00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:08.050\nLike immediately.\n\n340\n00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:08.580\n&gt;&gt; I should.\n\n341\n00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:11.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right up there with Hurricane Pete's.\n\n342\n00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:11.822\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Every time [CROSSTALK].\n\n343\n00:16:11.822 --> 00:16:12.774\n&gt;&gt; This is what we do every time.\n\n344\n00:16:12.774 --> 00:16:17.020\n&gt;&gt; Earth shatteringly good ideas that we\nnever fail to, we always fail to act on.\n\n345\n00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:18.380\nWe never act on.\n\n346\n00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:20.770\nAll right, so what I've done\non this particular screen, and\n\n347\n00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:22.920\nyou can see it's just\nobviously using Google.\n\n348\n00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.750\nI've just typed in a very simple search\nterm, but one that would be incredibly\n\n349\n00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:29.650\nimpactful for us as incident handlers,\nas security professionals.\n\n350\n00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:31.680\nTypes of security breaches in computers.\n\n351\n00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.360\nWho knows what we will find as\nwe spin the roulette wheel of\n\n352\n00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.520\ninformation knowledge out on the internet.\n\n353\n00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:41.240\nWe find 31.7 million hits in less than.\n\n354\n00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:43.300\nSix seconds.\n\n355\n00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:47.720\nSo, many scary things we can extrapolate\nabout that whole conversation, but\n\n356\n00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.020\nthat's not what we're here\nto talk about right now.\n\n357\n00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:51.300\nBecause of all those things,\n\n358\n00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:53.580\nonly about ten about them were\nactually relevant to our conversation.\n\n359\n00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So, looks incredibly impressive,\n\n360\n00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:57.860\nuntil you start digging into five or\nsix or seven screens later.\n\n361\n00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:59.770\nI find out there's absolutely\nnothing relevant there\n\n362\n00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:00.700\nto what we're talking about.\n\n363\n00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:03.930\nBut more importantly What will\nyou find when you do this\n\n364\n00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:05.520\nat some point in your systems?\n\n365\n00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:08.920\nUnderstanding that you're gonna be\nwatching this at some point in the future,\n\n366\n00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.510\nyou may not be watching\nit live with us now.\n\n367\n00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:11.220\nAs a matter of fact,\n\n368\n00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:13.880\npretty confident most of you are not\nwatching it now with us live.\n\n369\n00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.190\nSo, reality is, you may see this a day,\na week, a month,\n\n370\n00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:20.210\na year from the time that we're developing\nthis content and bringing it to you live.\n\n371\n00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:22.130\nThe good news is no matter\nwhen you type this string in,\n\n372\n00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:23.870\nyou're gonna see similar results.\n\n373\n00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:28.900\nYou may not see IBM 2016 Cost of Data\nBreach, but you'll see something, perhaps.\n\n374\n00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:29.790\nWho knows what.\n\n375\n00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:34.480\nThe reality is, what you're gonna see is\na lot of links to various cyber reports on\n\n376\n00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:38.360\ndata breaches and trending activity, and\nthat's what I wanted to show you, right?\n\n377\n00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:41.240\nYou could go out and\nclick on any one of these links and\n\n378\n00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:46.040\nyou would find information about the last\n12 or 24 months worth of activity.\n\n379\n00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:50.320\nOn the net when I go and I search for\nthe Verizon data breach report.\n\n380\n00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.690\nThe DBIR report which is what many\n\n381\n00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:55.800\ninformation security\nprofessionals will look at.\n\n382\n00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.510\nThe IBM report that was on\ntop of the prior screen.\n\n383\n00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:01.620\nIt is gonna be partnering\nwith the Ponemon Institute.\n\n384\n00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:05.420\nSo, the Ponemon Institute another great,\nreputable resource for\n\n385\n00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:06.850\nthis kind of information.\n\n386\n00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:12.130\nIBM has an entire security division\nthat put out these kind of data.\n\n387\n00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:15.680\nThere are many many organization around\nthe world that you can look to for\n\n388\n00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:20.340\nthese kind of information, but the DBIR,\nthe Data Breach Information and\n\n389\n00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:25.400\nInvestigation Report that Verizon puts\nout every year is very very important and\n\n390\n00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:31.710\nif you take a look The 2016 report which\nwas just released in the last week or so.\n\n391\n00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:37.240\nYou will find that the,\nwhich was released in 2017,\n\n392\n00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.960\nbut is a look back at the prior year,\nright, just to be clear.\n\n393\n00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:43.780\nYou will find that, and this is\nthe interesting headline on the cover\n\n394\n00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:48.250\nof this one, 89% of breaches had a\nfinancial or Espionage related motive for\n\n395\n00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:51.750\nthe last look back, or the last year's\nworth of data that's been gathered.\n\n396\n00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:53.130\n&gt;&gt; That's a big slice of that pie.\n\n397\n00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:57.690\n&gt;&gt; That is almost nine out of ten\nactivities that they profiled across\n\n398\n00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:00.950\nthe world, had some sort of financial or\nespionage related motive.\n\n399\n00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:04.190\nNow, espionage is on that list of\npotential attack vectors we talked about\n\n400\n00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:07.140\nthat can lead to incidents that\nwe would have to investigate.\n\n401\n00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:11.230\nEspionage is a very narrowly defined and\nvery specific and targeted activity.\n\n402\n00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:14.390\nBut when you think about\nthe fact that many entities and\n\n403\n00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:18.750\nmany individuals on behalf of entities are\nbeginning to attack each other with a very\n\n404\n00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:23.780\nspecific narrowly defined focus in mind,\nwhich is to steal information or assets.\n\n405\n00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:26.240\nAnd gain an advantage,\nthis activity doesn't become so\n\n406\n00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.530\nsurprising when you think about it.\n\n407\n00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:32.890\nRight, so we go under the covers a little\nand look at the information, aside from\n\n408\n00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:36.630\nthe obvious you know, who are the sponsors\nwho have looked out, that kind of thing.\n\n409\n00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:40.230\nIf we look at the table of contents\nwe'll see victim demographics.\n\n410\n00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:42.660\nCan we go full screen so\nwe can see that a little bit more clearly.\n\n411\n00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:45.460\nYou'll see victim demographics,\nbreech trends,\n\n412\n00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:47.080\nwe're going to take a look\nat those real quick.\n\n413\n00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.980\nPoints of focus,\nthere's that word we were talking about,\n\n414\n00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.020\nvulnerabilities, ie weaknesses.\n\n415\n00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:56.420\nSome indications of what those are,\nincident classification patterns.\n\n416\n00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:59.590\nWhat good incident responder wouldn't\nwant to understand the demographics and\n\n417\n00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:00.380\nthe patterns, right?\n\n418\n00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:02.730\nYou'd be looking at this,\nthis would be very important.\n\n419\n00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:06.620\nSo, let's go in Let's take a look\nat some of the demographics.\n\n420\n00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.370\nNo locale, industry, or\n\n421\n00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:11.900\norganization is bullet proof when\nit comes to the compromise of data.\n\n422\n00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:15.940\nIn other words, everybody is potentially\nequally going to be culpable and\n\n423\n00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:17.440\nequally going to have a problem here.\n\n424\n00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:22.500\nI mean, everybody potentially is going\nto have to be on the lookout for\n\n425\n00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.290\nthe signs of an incident and\nwhat they are, and\n\n426\n00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:26.310\nwe'll talk about some of\nthe signs of an incident.\n\n427\n00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:29.830\nWhat they may look like and some things to\nbe aware of here in just a couple minutes.\n\n428\n00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:32.470\nBut, yeah,\nwe have some demographic data here and\n\n429\n00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:35.570\nwhen you take a look at it,\nthis breaks down by industry.\n\n430\n00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:39.040\nYou could see here when we look\nat the accommodation industry,\n\n431\n00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:42.580\nyou look at agriculture,\nyou look at education, entertainment, etc.\n\n432\n00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:44.720\nWe could see all sorts\nof different trends.\n\n433\n00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:48.400\nAnd some industries have a much higher\nprofile than others obviously, right?\n\n434\n00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.440\nBut ultimately everybody is affected.\n\n435\n00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:56.930\nWhen we look at trending and we look at\nsome of the trends that they put out,\n\n436\n00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:01.300\nwe can see that the largest\nshare there in blue, external.\n\n437\n00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:01.920\nRight?\n\n438\n00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.660\nIs showing us that there's a great amount\nof activity coming in from outside.\n\n439\n00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:09.480\nYeah, this is an ongoing raging debate in\nour industry about whether the majority of\n\n440\n00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:14.620\nhacking and threat related activity comes\nfrom inside or outside the firewall, and\n\n441\n00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:18.240\nstudies show continuously that while\nwe see activity on both sides.\n\n442\n00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:22.100\nNo doubt about it, insider threat and\nattack vectors are very important to pay\n\n443\n00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:25.640\nattention to and some of the worse\nattacks come from insider activity.\n\n444\n00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:29.150\nBut we see relentless activity\ncoming from outside the firewall.\n\n445\n00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:34.350\nAPT, advanced persistent threat vectors,\nare always at the top of everybody's list.\n\n446\n00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:37.070\nIt's the unrelenting hacking, and\n\n447\n00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:41.320\nnibbling away at our defenses that takes\nplace from outside, that leads to most.\n\n448\n00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.980\nYou know, inbound activity in\nterms of seeing threat and\n\n449\n00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:49.370\nrisk because those are the attacks that\nover time will be successful just because\n\n450\n00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:52.870\nwe just don't ever, unfortunately,\nhave enough defenses, right?\n\n451\n00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:55.580\nWe relax our guard for\neven just a minute, and\n\n452\n00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:57.350\nsomebody's there to take advantage of us.\n\n453\n00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:00.190\nYou're going past all the charts and\nthings like that, and\n\n454\n00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:04.920\njust taking a look at, Some of the other\ndata that may of be of interest here,\n\n455\n00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.220\nlet me just scroll down real quick.\n\n456\n00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.390\nWe look at things like phishing and\nactivities around.\n\n457\n00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:12.980\nMajority of phishing cases\n\n458\n00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:17.260\nfeature phishing as a means to\ninstall persistent malware.\n\n459\n00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:20.580\nAnd this is something that we as incident\nhandlers have to be thinking about,\n\n460\n00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.170\nwe have to be aware of.\n\n461\n00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:27.130\nIt's not the fact that somebody is going\nout, going to a website on purpose,\n\n462\n00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:30.440\nand looking to bring malware into\nthe organization, and act badly.\n\n463\n00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:33.500\nIt's the fact that our good users\nare being tricked by bad people,\n\n464\n00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:37.030\ninto making bad decisions [INAUDIBLE]\nWithout the knowledge of the circumstance,\n\n465\n00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:39.550\nand the impact that is\ncausing this challenge.\n\n466\n00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:44.090\n&gt;&gt; West just had a friend, I think, today,\nget a phone call from Microsoft, saying.\n\n467\n00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:46.820\nWe're calling to help you clear\nthe viruses off of your computer.\n\n468\n00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:48.100\nWe've detected them.\n\n469\n00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:51.010\nAnd he said, Microsoft is calling you?\n\n470\n00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:53.140\nAnd I said, yeah that's what they said.\n\n471\n00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:54.400\nYeah, that's not Microsoft.\n\n472\n00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:55.910\nMicrosoft does not call you, nor\n\n473\n00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:59.350\ndo they care whether or not your machine\nis infected with a bunch of viruses.\n\n474\n00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:00.030\nThey have no care-\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n475\n00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:02.190\nto be fair, I'm sure they do care\nbecause they do provide, right?\n\n476\n00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:03.660\n&gt;&gt; Well as far as like\ntheir operating system.\n\n477\n00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:04.590\n&gt;&gt; We wanna put things in the same light.\n\n478\n00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:05.580\n[INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Well, what you wanna say, and\n\n479\n00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:08.390\nwhile I understand what you're saying is,\nwe just don't wanna give the wrong message\n\n480\n00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:12.220\nto the kind people out there, especially\nthose that may work for Microsoft, right?\n\n481\n00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:14.970\nWe love you, you're very nice people,\nbut what Daniel's trying to say, and\n\n482\n00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:16.250\nhe's absolutely right about this.\n\n483\n00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:19.490\nA big entity like Microsoft\ndoesn't have the resources and\n\n484\n00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:23.340\nthe focus to interact with a single\nindividual in this kind of scenario, and\n\n485\n00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:26.020\nmake a proactive or\neven reactive call to them.\n\n486\n00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:30.070\nBut certainly they provide anti-malware,\nanti-virus software and\n\n487\n00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:31.250\nthey are concerned, right?\n\n488\n00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:33.570\nAbout the security of\ntheir overall product but\n\n489\n00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:36.810\nnot at the individual level in\nthe micro causing like this.\n\n490\n00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:37.960\nThey would never call you and\n\n491\n00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:42.045\nsay hey, we've detected a problem, just\nlike your bank will never call you and\n\n492\n00:23:42.045 --> 00:23:45.155\nsay, we need your password,\ncuz we have to reset your account.\n\n493\n00:23:45.155 --> 00:23:46.605\nThose kind of things just don't happen.\n\n494\n00:23:46.605 --> 00:23:48.682\nAnd that's what we have to\neducate our users about, right?\n\n495\n00:23:48.682 --> 00:23:53.492\nAnd that's really the important message,\nis if we can get the people on the end of\n\n496\n00:23:53.492 --> 00:23:58.394\nthose phishing phone calls to understand\nthat they should be a little skeptical.\n\n497\n00:23:58.394 --> 00:24:02.285\nAnd the worst thing you could do is say\nyes to somebody without asking why.\n\n498\n00:24:02.285 --> 00:24:05.034\nThe best thing you can do is make them\nwait five minutes while you validate\n\n499\n00:24:05.034 --> 00:24:06.128\nwhat they're telling you.\n\n500\n00:24:06.128 --> 00:24:08.780\nIt may be an inconvenience to them,\nbut this is not about them.\n\n501\n00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.810\nIt's about your safety, right.\n\n502\n00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:13.487\nMom and dad were right years ago when\nthey said stranger danger, right.\n\n503\n00:24:13.487 --> 00:24:15.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Don't talk to strangers, right.\n\n504\n00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:18.800\nAnd the reality is if a stranger,\nlike in this example is calling you,\n\n505\n00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:22.340\nlisten I would love it if those kind of\ncompanies were proactive in calling me,\n\n506\n00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:24.100\nI think that would be\nthe best thing in the world.\n\n507\n00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:26.893\nBut knowing what I know about our\nindustry, as Daniel pointed out,\n\n508\n00:24:26.893 --> 00:24:28.078\nthat just doesn't happen.\n\n509\n00:24:28.078 --> 00:24:31.955\nSo indicating to people that that's a\nfalse claim when they get that phone call\n\n510\n00:24:31.955 --> 00:24:35.670\nis so important for us as incident\nhandlers, as security professionals.\n\n511\n00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:37.800\nBecause we are the voice of reason,\n\n512\n00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:40.853\nwe are the people that\nare suppose to know better and\n\n513\n00:24:40.853 --> 00:24:45.980\nif we can authoritatively tell people hey\nthis is not happening this is not real.\n\n514\n00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:49.518\nDon't take this seriously, then that's\nsomething that's important that we've\n\n515\n00:24:49.518 --> 00:24:51.877\ngotta be able to communicate broadly and\nloudly about.\n\n516\n00:24:51.877 --> 00:24:54.260\nSo this is the kind of\nstuff we wanna think about.\n\n517\n00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:58.021\nWhen I said, hey, we should focus\non the categories and incidents and\n\n518\n00:24:58.021 --> 00:25:02.421\nthe signs of incidents that are occurring\nto the points that we were just looking at\n\n519\n00:25:02.421 --> 00:25:03.974\nin this data breach report.\n\n520\n00:25:03.974 --> 00:25:06.904\nThere are two kinds of incidents\nthat we wanna think about or\n\n521\n00:25:06.904 --> 00:25:08.760\ncategories of incidents right?\n\n522\n00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:11.632\nThere are precursors and\nthere are indications, right,\n\n523\n00:25:11.632 --> 00:25:12.984\nthat we wanna think about.\n\n524\n00:25:12.984 --> 00:25:16.374\nA precursor incident is something\nthat happens prior to the incident.\n\n525\n00:25:16.374 --> 00:25:19.798\nIt's the things that go on prior to the\nincident actually occurring to indicate\n\n526\n00:25:19.798 --> 00:25:23.170\nthe possibility of the occurrence, the\nlining up of all the things that have to\n\n527\n00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:26.464\nbe there in order for us to say\ndefinitively, yeah, that's gonna happen.\n\n528\n00:25:26.464 --> 00:25:27.750\nBut it hasn't happened yet.\n\n529\n00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:31.770\nThese are the red flags that go up ahead\nof time that if we're paying attention to,\n\n530\n00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:35.140\ncould warn us that there is something\nthat we should either stop or\n\n531\n00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:37.860\nmitigate or interact with or\npotentially question.\n\n532\n00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:41.280\nWhen somebody calls and says they're from\nMicrosoft, that's a precursor incident.\n\n533\n00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.780\nWe should be raising a red flag and\n\n534\n00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:46.580\nsaying, but wait a second, as we talked\nabout that's not likely to happen,\n\n535\n00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:52.620\nnot unless we have a support contract with\nthem, whatever, and that's not the case.\n\n536\n00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:54.820\nAn individual at home, not gonna happen.\n\n537\n00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:57.232\nSo that's something to think about,\nright, and\n\n538\n00:25:57.232 --> 00:26:00.115\nthat's the kind of activity\nthat we would want to focus on.\n\n539\n00:26:00.115 --> 00:26:03.556\nAnd we would wanna educate our users\nabout, those that we're responsible for,\n\n540\n00:26:03.556 --> 00:26:05.030\nand make them pay attention to it.\n\n541\n00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:08.480\nI tell my customers and my students\nall the time as I said already,\n\n542\n00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:12.500\nit's better to question and\nstop and pause and\n\n543\n00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:16.200\nreflect than it is just to say yes because\nyou're worried about upsetting somebody.\n\n544\n00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:19.060\nWorst that'll happen is legitimate person\non the other end of that phone that's\n\n545\n00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:22.535\nreally trying to do the right thing for\nyou, will work with you and\n\n546\n00:26:22.535 --> 00:26:24.065\nunderstand that you have\nto validate who they are.\n\n547\n00:26:24.065 --> 00:26:26.876\nIt's the people that are looking to\ndo harm that are gonna get really\n\n548\n00:26:26.876 --> 00:26:29.688\nuptight about your questioning that\nare gonna push and say come on,\n\n549\n00:26:29.688 --> 00:26:30.893\nyou just gotta do, come on.\n\n550\n00:26:30.893 --> 00:26:31.965\nDon't you know this is important?\n\n551\n00:26:31.965 --> 00:26:32.855\nWe gotta take care of this.\n\n552\n00:26:32.855 --> 00:26:35.010\nThose are the people you\nwanna stay aware from.\n\n553\n00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:38.686\nIf you're questioning my authority and\nmy ability to do something for you, if I'm\n\n554\n00:26:38.686 --> 00:26:42.111\nlegitimate I should be able to take the\ntime to step back and explain it to you.\n\n555\n00:26:42.111 --> 00:26:45.930\nNow, there's always a what if,\nbut in every situation right?\n\n556\n00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:49.670\nIf this is a life and death scenario, I\nunderstand that you may need to just trust\n\n557\n00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:52.650\npeople, and deal with them and\nask questions later.\n\n558\n00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:56.040\nI'm not suggesting in those situations\nthat that may or may not be the outcome.\n\n559\n00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.980\nBut, let's be honest, somebody\ncalling to tell you they found a virus\n\n560\n00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:01.186\non your machine,\nit's not a life or death scenario.\n\n561\n00:27:01.186 --> 00:27:04.410\nYou can afford to take five minutes and\nvalidate who they are before you say yes.\n\n562\n00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:06.690\nAnd as a result,\nprobably save yourself and\n\n563\n00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:08.450\neverybody around you a lot of time and\ntrouble.\n\n564\n00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:09.670\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n565\n00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:13.110\nIndication incidents,\nthese are, are gonna imply,\n\n566\n00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:14.920\nrather, that the incident\nhas already occurred.\n\n567\n00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.280\nIn other words,\nlooking back after the fact and\n\n568\n00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:19.480\nseeing indicators of the incident.\n\n569\n00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:22.898\nWe see log entires that show that\nthere was suspicious activity.\n\n570\n00:27:22.898 --> 00:27:27.820\nWe see probably an upgrade or\n\n571\n00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:30.840\nan uptick in network activity\nright around certain shares.\n\n572\n00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:36.190\nWe may see timestamps going off\nkinda of on the deep end, and\n\n573\n00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:40.340\nlog entries being mysteriously rewritten,\nand all the other suspicious activity.\n\n574\n00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:42.650\nWe may see increased processor activity,\nand\n\n575\n00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:45.910\nwho knows what else around a machine that\nmay have been infected or compromised.\n\n576\n00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:50.200\nWe may see a lot of activity at\nthe firewall, or at the IDS, or the IPS,\n\n577\n00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:53.290\nthe intrusion detection,\nintrusion prevention systems.\n\n578\n00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:57.310\nThese are indicators after the fact\nthat there has been a breach, right?\n\n579\n00:27:57.310 --> 00:27:59.620\nAnd these are things we would\nneed to be aware of as well.\n\n580\n00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:02.990\nIt would be great if we picked up on this\nbeforehand, but the reality is a lot of\n\n581\n00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:06.560\nthese activities occur, and\nwe have to diagnose them after the fact.\n\n582\n00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:10.485\nRemember as instant handlers, it's gonna\nbe our job more often than not to look\n\n583\n00:28:10.485 --> 00:28:13.181\nbackwards and\nreflect on what's already occurred and\n\n584\n00:28:13.181 --> 00:28:17.003\ntry to decipher the signs as oppose to\nproactively stopping it ahead of time.\n\n585\n00:28:17.003 --> 00:28:18.689\nIt would be great if we could do that, but\n\n586\n00:28:18.689 --> 00:28:21.171\nthe reality is we don't often\nget the chance to do that, and\n\n587\n00:28:21.171 --> 00:28:24.270\nthat's something that we have to think\nabout and just be aware of as well.\n\n588\n00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:29.150\nWhen we think about incident categories\nand categorization of incidents,\n\n589\n00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:31.150\njust like classification of data.\n\n590\n00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:35.415\nThere is no right and wrong here, but we\noften think about high, middle and low or\n\n591\n00:28:35.415 --> 00:28:39.745\nlow, medium, high as being the levels or\nthe categorization of incidents that we\n\n592\n00:28:39.745 --> 00:28:43.232\nwould often look to or\nwanna think about or potentially point to.\n\n593\n00:28:43.232 --> 00:28:45.380\nWhen we think about low level Incidence.\n\n594\n00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:48.765\nWe think about things that don't have\na tremendous amount of impact on us.\n\n595\n00:28:48.765 --> 00:28:49.965\nSomebody going in and\n\n596\n00:28:49.965 --> 00:28:53.840\nhaving to reset their password cuz\nthey got locked out of an account.\n\n597\n00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:57.560\nBecause they essentially just entered\nit incorrectly one too many times and\n\n598\n00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.710\nviolated security policy\nthat is an incident.\n\n599\n00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:02.140\nWe have to classify that,\nwe have to log it, we have to track it.\n\n600\n00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.830\nBut it was self-inflicted and\n\n601\n00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:06.310\nit really doesn't do anything more\nthan just inconvenience the user for\n\n602\n00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:10.270\na couple of minutes while they have to\nreset themselves and it's not a big deal.\n\n603\n00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:13.190\nIt's a low level, or at least\nan example of a low level incident.\n\n604\n00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:16.421\nMaybe unsuccessful scans and\nprobes against the network.\n\n605\n00:29:16.421 --> 00:29:19.321\nWe wanna take notice of the fact\nthey're happening at the firewall,\n\n606\n00:29:19.321 --> 00:29:21.271\nwe wanna log them,\nwe wanna be aware of them but\n\n607\n00:29:21.271 --> 00:29:23.378\nif they were not successful\nif they were blocked.\n\n608\n00:29:23.378 --> 00:29:25.735\nAgain low level incidence\nnot a lot of impact,\n\n609\n00:29:25.735 --> 00:29:29.140\npotentially not a lot of\nnegative consequences or outcome.\n\n610\n00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:33.018\nWhat about medium level or\nmidlevel incidents?\n\n611\n00:29:33.018 --> 00:29:36.170\nMaybe somebody gets fired,\nunfriendly employee termination, right.\n\n612\n00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:38.750\nThat can lead to a lot of\npotential complications,\n\n613\n00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:44.370\nmaybe they seek to take advantage of their\nhatred or concern over being fired and\n\n614\n00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:48.170\nthey look to spread malware in the company\nbefore we revoke their access.\n\n615\n00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:52.470\nMaybe they keep their laptop and company\nresources and don't turn them in and\n\n616\n00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:54.970\nthat can lead to complications and\nconcerns.\n\n617\n00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:58.530\nMaybe illegal, as Daniel was talking\nabout, illegal access to a building or\n\n618\n00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:00.678\nillegal access to a secure\narea of a building.\n\n619\n00:30:00.678 --> 00:30:04.586\nThat could be a middle-level or mid-level\nincident that can lead to potential\n\n620\n00:30:04.586 --> 00:30:06.870\ncompromise and significant liability.\n\n621\n00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:08.900\nBut we have to assess it for\nwhat it is, right?\n\n622\n00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:12.190\nThese are examples, right,\nof things that may be in that category.\n\n623\n00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:13.994\nWhat about high-level incidents?\n\n624\n00:30:13.994 --> 00:30:17.389\nIncidents at the high level or\nhighest level of our categorization,\n\n625\n00:30:17.389 --> 00:30:22.190\ndenial-of-service attacks, successful\nhack attacks, infestation with malware.\n\n626\n00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:26.610\nRooting a system, stealing a username and\npassword, successfully logging on and\n\n627\n00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:30.860\ncompromising other systems, any or all of\nthese activities would be classified as\n\n628\n00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:33.915\nhigh level or\nworthy of a lot of time and attention.\n\n629\n00:30:33.915 --> 00:30:36.870\nAnd we have to think about what\nthey are and also understand\n\n630\n00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:41.230\nhow to prioritize the incidents that are\noccurring based on this categorization.\n\n631\n00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:43.950\nIt's not enough just to say low,\nmedium, high.\n\n632\n00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:47.160\nYeah you had to reset your password,\nwe have a self service mechanism for that.\n\n633\n00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:49.070\nWe'll make a log entry, no big deal.\n\n634\n00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:52.821\nWe have to prioritize these incidents\nbecause we have to understand how to\n\n635\n00:30:52.821 --> 00:30:53.734\nrespond to them.\n\n636\n00:30:53.734 --> 00:30:57.136\nIt's not just about categorizing them and\nunderstanding what they are, but\n\n637\n00:30:57.136 --> 00:30:58.350\nthen what is our response.\n\n638\n00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:00.320\nAre we responding in kind?\n\n639\n00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.524\nSomebody has to self-service and\nreset their password.\n\n640\n00:31:02.524 --> 00:31:04.650\nAs an instance handler,\nI don't really need to do anything,\n\n641\n00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:06.820\nI just need to be aware\nof the fact it happened.\n\n642\n00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:11.420\nLater when I do an audit, and I just\nwanna take note of it, but nothing more.\n\n643\n00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:13.780\nCertainly not immediate\nreal time response or\n\n644\n00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:15.880\nnot almost immediate real time response.\n\n645\n00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:18.490\nBut simply just notification and\nawareness, nothing more.\n\n646\n00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:22.010\nBut if I have an active denial of\nservice attack taking place, and\n\n647\n00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:25.476\nMalware's being propagated\nthrough a body to rooted machine.\n\n648\n00:31:25.476 --> 00:31:28.561\nI have to respond immediately\nat that point of contact and\n\n649\n00:31:28.561 --> 00:31:32.932\nI have to bring everything I have with me\nand I have to overwhelm that incident with\n\n650\n00:31:32.932 --> 00:31:36.167\na response enforce that will\nstop that attack in real time.\n\n651\n00:31:36.167 --> 00:31:40.427\nIf I don't do that, I've lost the ability\nto be able to control that situation and\n\n652\n00:31:40.427 --> 00:31:43.022\ncatastrophic damage and failure can occur.\n\n653\n00:31:43.022 --> 00:31:47.772\nPrioritizing the incidents based on\nthis categorization, based on our\n\n654\n00:31:47.772 --> 00:31:53.022\nability to respond becomes the second part\nor the secondary leg of categorization.\n\n655\n00:31:53.022 --> 00:31:55.283\nIt's not enough just to categorize,\nwe have to then prioritize.\n\n656\n00:31:55.283 --> 00:31:58.181\nSo we have to understand\nthe technical effects and\n\n657\n00:31:58.181 --> 00:32:02.601\nthe criticality of the incident in order\nto be able to respond effectively.\n\n658\n00:32:02.601 --> 00:32:04.415\nDaniel, if I said to you,\n\n659\n00:32:04.415 --> 00:32:09.365\nThat we have potentially piece of\nmalware that's infected a system but\n\n660\n00:32:09.365 --> 00:32:14.600\nwe're not sure what it is and\nwe're not sure how devastating it may be.\n\n661\n00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:17.527\nAs a security professional,\nas an IT professional, as an handler,\n\n662\n00:32:17.527 --> 00:32:18.253\nwhat do you think?\n\n663\n00:32:18.253 --> 00:32:20.570\nWhat comes to mind about\nwhat we would need to do and\n\n664\n00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:22.900\nneed to know in order to\ndeal with that situation?\n\n665\n00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:26.210\n&gt;&gt; The first think I'd do is get\nthat machine off of my network ASAP.\n\n666\n00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:28.930\nIt's no longer going to be able to\nphone home if that's what it's doing.\n\n667\n00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:31.770\nOr any other thing that's gonna get\nisolated cuz that's what we wanna do.\n\n668\n00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:34.060\nWe wanna triage that as soon as possible.\n\n669\n00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:37.600\nAnd then we'll jump into to it, to kinda\ntry to figure out what it's doing,\n\n670\n00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:38.290\nhow it's working.\n\n671\n00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:40.878\nIs it ransom ware,\nis it just malware, is it spyware?\n\n672\n00:32:40.878 --> 00:32:44.366\nWhat is it that's happening and then\nfrom there, once we've discerned that,\n\n673\n00:32:44.366 --> 00:32:46.680\nwe'll figure out the impact\nto our business.\n\n674\n00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:49.907\nHas any compromise occurred other than\njust the installation of the malware?\n\n675\n00:32:49.907 --> 00:32:53.505\nHas files been mangled or\ncompromised in some way?\n\n676\n00:32:53.505 --> 00:32:54.490\nAnd you'll have to move in.\n\n677\n00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:57.080\nIt all just comes down\nto what has happened and\n\n678\n00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.010\nfollowing the bread crumbs\nwhere they lead you.\n\n679\n00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:02.171\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and what Daniel describes is\nexactly what we would wanna hear or\n\n680\n00:33:02.171 --> 00:33:03.251\nwhat we would wanna do.\n\n681\n00:33:03.251 --> 00:33:07.220\nThe other thing I wanna add, and Daniel's\nexplanation is spot-on, 100% accurate.\n\n682\n00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:11.350\nThe only thing I want to add to it is I\nwant to throw two terms that he described\n\n683\n00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:12.760\nbut didn't call out by name.\n\n684\n00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:16.080\nBut I think a really important for you\nto be aware of around this conversation.\n\n685\n00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:21.269\nSo what Daniel was describing essentially\nwas a response that would be methodical,\n\n686\n00:33:21.269 --> 00:33:23.169\nwould be hopefully planned and\n\n687\n00:33:23.169 --> 00:33:27.937\nwould be enacted based on a series of\nsteps that are documented ahead of time.\n\n688\n00:33:27.937 --> 00:33:33.023\nAnd we would find those steps and that\nresponse plan typically in our business\n\n689\n00:33:33.023 --> 00:33:37.970\ncontinuity plan RBCP DRP disaster\nrecovery discontinuity planning.\n\n690\n00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:40.745\nAnd probably our incident response\nplan as a subset of that.\n\n691\n00:33:40.745 --> 00:33:44.865\nAnd that would be driven in alignment with\nsomething known as, and Daniel again,\n\n692\n00:33:44.865 --> 00:33:47.981\ntalked about this, but\ndidn't call it right out, our SLAs.\n\n693\n00:33:47.981 --> 00:33:52.749\nOur Service Level Agreements that would be\nused to govern, are gonna provide services\n\n694\n00:33:52.749 --> 00:33:56.404\nin the first place, because the only\nway we know have to respond and\n\n695\n00:33:56.404 --> 00:34:00.912\nprioritize our response and then restore\nservices aligned with the necessity for\n\n696\n00:34:00.912 --> 00:34:03.350\nour response to measure them against.\n\n697\n00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:04.270\nThe service contract,\n\n698\n00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:07.620\nthe commitment that we have with\nthe business to provide certain services.\n\n699\n00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:12.680\nIf we lose the ability to be able\nto use color printing, that may or\n\n700\n00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:15.000\nmay not be important in\nthe grand scheme of things, but\n\n701\n00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.620\nthe use of email is probably\na lot more important.\n\n702\n00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:20.800\nAnd while we want to restore\nservices in both cases,\n\n703\n00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:24.530\nwe may move a lot more quickly and\nauthoritatively and effectively to\n\n704\n00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:28.510\nrestore email than we may color printing\nbased on what Daniel was describing.\n\n705\n00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:30.860\nWe would isolate the machine\nthat's been infected.\n\n706\n00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:33.530\nFirst thing he said,\ncut it off from the network so\n\n707\n00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:35.770\nthat whatever it's already done is done.\n\n708\n00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:36.870\nBut it's not going to do anything else.\n\n709\n00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:39.020\nAt least we're hoping it won't\nbe able to do anything else and\n\n710\n00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:40.760\nthen let's assess where we are.\n\n711\n00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:43.180\nHow significant and\nimpactful the damage has been.\n\n712\n00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:45.210\nLet's put a border of\ncontainment around it.\n\n713\n00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:50.350\nLet's make sure that we're isolating\nit and respond to restore services.\n\n714\n00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:53.840\nOutside that border, and then let's\ntriage what's going on inside, and\n\n715\n00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.830\nlet's make sure we can understand it and\nprevent it from occurring again.\n\n716\n00:34:56.830 --> 00:34:59.550\nThis is driven directly by our BCDPR.\n\n717\n00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:03.870\nSo, our DRBCP disaster recovery\nbusiness continuity plans, and\n\n718\n00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:06.910\nby our SLAs, one or more,\ndepending on what we are talking about.\n\n719\n00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:10.190\nAdding all this together helps us to\nunderstand the technical as well as\n\n720\n00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:15.360\nthe technicality and criticality, I should\nsay, of the attack or of the incident.\n\n721\n00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.690\nAnd weighing these two things and\n\n722\n00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:19.781\nunderstanding how to respond to them\nis what incident handlers are doing, or\n\n723\n00:35:19.781 --> 00:35:21.742\nat least we should be doing,\non a regular basis.\n\n724\n00:35:21.742 --> 00:35:25.709\nAnd this is gonna be very important for\nus to think about, and to understand In\n\n725\n00:35:25.709 --> 00:35:29.630\nthe grand scheme of things, how to\nexecute on and execute on successfully.\n\n726\n00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:33.994\n&gt;&gt; Adam, a lot of talk today about\nincidents, and what they look like,\n\n727\n00:35:33.994 --> 00:35:37.523\nhow we can respond to them, and\nthat's starting to build that foundation.\n\n728\n00:35:37.523 --> 00:35:39.540\nIt's the whole purpose of this course.\n\n729\n00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:41.980\nSo we're starting to dip\nour toe into that water.\n\n730\n00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:45.310\nAdam, you've done a good job of\ngiving us the breadth of that,\n\n731\n00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:47.670\nas you can see it is quite wide.\n\n732\n00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:51.310\nSo we'll have a lot to cover in\nour series as things unfold.\n\n733\n00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:53.520\nThat being said,\nAdam we are well out of time for\n\n734\n00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:57.090\nthis episode, we do look forward to\nseeing you in our upcoming episodes.\n\n735\n00:35:57.090 --> 00:36:00.190\nWe do thank you guys for watching,\nbut that being said, it is time for\n\n736\n00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:01.080\nus to sign off.\n\n737\n00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.882\nFor ITProTV I've been you're host,\nDaniel Lawry.\n\n738\n00:36:03.882 --> 00:36:04.832\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n739\n00:36:04.832 --> 00:36:05.773\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next

00:00:13.580\nwatching ITProTV\n&gt;&gt; All right greetings everyone and\n\n4\n00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.298\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.298 --> 00:00:20.870\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we're back with more of our EC\n\n6\n00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.462\ncouncil certified incident handler series.\n\n7\n00:00:23.462 --> 00:00:26.976\nAnd of course joining us back in\nthe studio to continue our conversation,\n\n8\n00:00:26.976 --> 00:00:30.436\ncontinue to build some foundational\nknowledge, our good friend, Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:30.436 --> 00:00:31.140\nAdam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.940\nAdam, welcome back, man.\n\n11\n00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.578\nHow's it going today?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It is going well.\n\n12\n00:00:33.578 --> 00:00:34.726\nIt is going well.\n\n13\n00:00:34.726 --> 00:00:38.806\nBased on our conversation before we came\non camera it's going fabulously well,\n\n14\n00:00:38.806 --> 00:00:39.870\nI should say.\n\n15\n00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.276\nSo I'm looking forward to having yet\nanother conversation with everybody.\n\n16\n00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:43.949\nTalking some more about incident handling.\n\n17\n00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.178\nAnd we left off in our last conversation\ntalking a little bit about how we\n\n18\n00:00:48.178 --> 00:00:51.283\nstructure incident handling,\nwhat it looks like,\n\n19\n00:00:51.283 --> 00:00:53.980\nwhat's the vocabulary associated with it.\n\n20\n00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.350\nWe talked about ARTV, or\nas I thought about it after the fact,\n\n21\n00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.720\nART TV cuz it could have been since\nit's two Ts, the acronym for you attack,\n\n22\n00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.450\nrisk, threat, threat source and\nvulnerabilities.\n\n23\n00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.200\nSo we went through that\nvocabulary with you,\n\n24\n00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.958\ntried to help you to\nbetter understand that.\n\n25\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.830\nAnd those terms are gonna be important.\n\n26\n00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.500\nWe talked about confidentiality,\nintegrity, and availability.\n\n27\n00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.620\nAnd why those terms are so\nimportant to what we talk about.\n\n28\n00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.530\nI wanna continue our conversations\naround incident response,\n\n29\n00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.070\nand what the concept of\nincident response looks like.\n\n30\n00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.887\nSo, Daniel if I say to you,\n\n31\n00:01:22.887 --> 00:01:27.074\nsomebody is breaking in to our\nserver over in the server room and\n\n32\n00:01:27.074 --> 00:01:31.981\nwe've gotta go figure out what to do\nabout that, what would you say to me.\n\n33\n00:01:31.981 --> 00:01:33.862\nWhat would be kind of the first\nthing that jumps into your mind?\n\n34\n00:01:33.862 --> 00:01:36.044\nWhat are you thinking and\nwhat do we need to address?\n\n35\n00:01:36.044 --> 00:01:37.496\n&gt;&gt; I'd say hold my beer and watch this.\n\n36\n00:01:37.496 --> 00:01:40.259\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Remember, no violence.\n\n37\n00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.036\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Violence is never the answer, right?\n\n38\n00:01:42.036 --> 00:01:45.393\n&gt;&gt; So, obviously we would probably\nwanna get eyes on the problem,\n\n39\n00:01:45.393 --> 00:01:47.490\nyou said someone is breaking into.\n\n40\n00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.938\nWe're gonna call authorities if we feel\nlike this is a criminal violation, wanna\n\n41\n00:01:51.938 --> 00:01:56.328\nget somebody with the authority to make\nan arrest, to come and help us with that.\n\n42\n00:01:56.328 --> 00:01:58.470\nAnd then we're just\ngonna follow procedure.\n\n43\n00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.880\nHopefully we have a procedure outlined\non how to handle said incident so\n\n44\n00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.130\nthat we can follow those various\nsteps to be in alignment with that.\n\n45\n00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.370\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nwhat Daniel basically laid out for\n\n46\n00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.810\nus is,\nthe definition of incidence response.\n\n47\n00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.560\nHe told us that we need some\nsort of structured excuse me,\n\n48\n00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.520\nstructured approach, right?\n\n49\n00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.540\nIn other words,\nwe need a plan as Daniel said.\n\n50\n00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.120\nNot just a plan, but\nwe need a plan that covers several things.\n\n51\n00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.940\nWe've got to be able to respond\nto the initial incident,\n\n52\n00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.896\nwe may have to bring in additional\npeople or capabilities.\n\n53\n00:02:27.896 --> 00:02:30.442\nHe mentioned law enforcement that may or\nmay not be appropriate,\n\n54\n00:02:30.442 --> 00:02:33.633\ndepending on what's happening of course,\nbut we have to at least have the ability\n\n55\n00:02:33.633 --> 00:02:36.440\nto understand how to deal with\nthat if that becomes a necessity.\n\n56\n00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.740\nWe may need to be able to confront\nsomebody who is either physically or\n\n57\n00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.340\nlogically present in\nthe system in some way, or\n\n58\n00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.920\nvirtually I guess,\ndepending on what we would think of.\n\n59\n00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.200\nAnd as a result, we need to be able\nto understand what resources we have,\n\n60\n00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.870\nwhat capabilities we possess, and how to\nbring those to bear in order to minimize\n\n61\n00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.840\nthe damage and\nthen figure out how to restore normalcy.\n\n62\n00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.640\nAnd so incident responses about all these\nthings, it's about having the structured\n\n63\n00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.860\napproach and this plan that lets us\nmanage the various incidents, the various\n\n64\n00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.030\nthings that may go on, whether or not\nwe have anticipated all of them or not.\n\n65\n00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.520\nWe've talked in prior discussions\nabout the fact that planning and\n\n66\n00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.090\nbeing prepared is so\nimportant to what we do.\n\n67\n00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.730\nYeah, we can't anticipate everything,\nright?\n\n68\n00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:18.820\nI mean, let's be honest.\n\n69\n00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.540\nHow many times have you woken up\nin the morning gotten in the car,\n\n70\n00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.790\ndriven to work or wherever you're going.\n\n71\n00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.860\nYou get stuck in traffic because you\ndon't realize that there's an accident or\n\n72\n00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:27.820\nwhatever the case may be,\n\n73\n00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.170\nit's just a variable in your\ndaily commute and it happens.\n\n74\n00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.860\nYou may not be able to anticipate it,\nmaybe you have Waze or\n\n75\n00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.680\nsome sort of app that lets you do that,\nbut maybe you're not paying attention, or\n\n76\n00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.570\nmaybe you are but\nmaybe it doesn't update it in real time.\n\n77\n00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.810\nMy point is there's all these variables\nand possibilities to play out.\n\n78\n00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.890\nWe can't anticipate a plan for everything.\n\n79\n00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.000\nWhat we have to do is plan to be\nsuccessful by being aware of our\n\n80\n00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.480\nsurroundings and understanding that\nthe unknown is not something to be feared.\n\n81\n00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.850\nBut rather something to address\nin the most likely and therefore,\n\n82\n00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.820\nhopefully, most successful way possible,\ngiven the resources we possess.\n\n83\n00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.772\nThe people that are successful, in other\nwords, at being incident handlers,\n\n84\n00:04:05.772 --> 00:04:08.387\nare not the people that are omnipotent and\nknow how to tell the future.\n\n85\n00:04:08.387 --> 00:04:10.059\nI mean, that would be great, right?\n\n86\n00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:12.880\nBut it just doesn't work, unfortunately.\n\n87\n00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.302\nThe reality is people are successful at\nwhat we do are the people that understand\n\n88\n00:04:17.302 --> 00:04:20.272\nhow to marshall resources and\nbring them together and\n\n89\n00:04:20.272 --> 00:04:23.110\nfocus them at the point of\ninflection to impact that\n\n90\n00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.060\nsituation positively with\na minimal amount of disruption.\n\n91\n00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.610\nSo when we think about\nhaving incident response,\n\n92\n00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.610\nwe think about having the broad structure,\nthe plan Daniel talked about laid out, but\n\n93\n00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.100\nthis is the trick, we keep coming\nback to this time and again.\n\n94\n00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.150\nWe have to broadly communicate that,\n\n95\n00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.550\nmake everybody aware of that plan\nthrough training and awareness.\n\n96\n00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.840\nMake sure they understand that, and\n\n97\n00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.820\nthat they, they being everybody\ninvolved in the business.\n\n98\n00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.590\nWho may, in some way, be touched by this\nincident, or be part of this response, and\n\n99\n00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.710\nthat everybody understands what their job,\ntheir responsibility, their role is.\n\n100\n00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.885\nYou know at home, when I am home cuz\nI'm not home all that often, but\n\n101\n00:04:59.885 --> 00:05:01.551\nwhen I am home on occasion, right?\n\n102\n00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:05.520\nThe place I go to do my laundry and\nrest my weary head from time to time.\n\n103\n00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.321\nWhen I am home, and we have,\nas many families do, a list of chores.\n\n104\n00:05:10.321 --> 00:05:15.180\nThings that your kids have to do,\nyou have to do, your wife does, whatever.\n\n105\n00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.159\nYour significant other,\nspouse, whoever it may be.\n\n106\n00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:18.894\n[COUGH] And we go through that and\n\n107\n00:05:18.894 --> 00:05:22.080\nI constantly have this\nconversation with my wife.\n\n108\n00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.181\nHey the girls are or\nare not able to do this or that this week.\n\n109\n00:05:25.181 --> 00:05:29.620\nThey're busy with soccer, band,\nschool, socializing, whatever.\n\n110\n00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.720\nAnd you know we need to get this\nservice done, are they gonna do it?\n\n111\n00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.438\nAnd you have to have that rhythm and\nthat plan, and\n\n112\n00:05:35.438 --> 00:05:37.525\nthat assessment of the current need.\n\n113\n00:05:37.525 --> 00:05:40.242\nAnd the understanding of how\nto adjust that as you go.\n\n114\n00:05:40.242 --> 00:05:42.465\nAnd it's all about communication right?\n\n115\n00:05:42.465 --> 00:05:45.745\nIf you're not communicating positively,\nopenly, honestly,\n\n116\n00:05:45.745 --> 00:05:48.225\neffectively, you're not\ndoing incident response,\n\n117\n00:05:48.225 --> 00:05:50.445\nyou're not doing incident handling\nin a way that makes sense.\n\n118\n00:05:50.445 --> 00:05:53.561\nBecause what's gonna happen is, you're\ntalking about stuff with a very small,\n\n119\n00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:54.644\nselect group of people, but\n\n120\n00:05:54.644 --> 00:05:57.054\nthose people don't know how to\nreach out to those around them.\n\n121\n00:05:57.054 --> 00:05:59.376\nAnd this is a team, a communal effort.\n\n122\n00:05:59.376 --> 00:06:03.734\nEverybody in the business is gonna play a\npart in some way in incident response and\n\n123\n00:06:03.734 --> 00:06:06.620\nincident handling because\neverybody in the business\n\n124\n00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.070\nis gonna be affected by the incident.\n\n125\n00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.910\nAnd whether they sit back and watch,\nwhether they get in the way, whether they\n\n126\n00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.600\nactively or passively support what you do,\nthey're gonna be a part of this.\n\n127\n00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.160\nAnd if they're not prepared,\nand they're not aware, and\n\n128\n00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.380\nthey're not trained, then you're\nunfortunately gonna probably have a train\n\n129\n00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.140\nwreck as opposed to a response, right?\n\n130\n00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.950\nSo keep this in mind and understand this.\n\n131\n00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.270\nThe goal with incident management,\n\n132\n00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.990\nand incidence response ultimately,\nis to minimize disruption.\n\n133\n00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.930\nMinimize the negative costs associated\nwith this threat from a threat source.\n\n134\n00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.550\nThe risk in other words that we engage and\ntry to minimize Is, first and\n\n135\n00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.260\nforemost, disruption,\nloss of access, loss of service,\n\n136\n00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:48.000\nbreach of confidentiality, violation\nof integrity, lack of availability.\n\n137\n00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.420\nBut all those things translate\ninto dollars and cents, right?\n\n138\n00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.830\nI mean, ultimately, that costs money.\n\n139\n00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.220\nImagine, for a minute.\n\n140\n00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.573\nI have this conversation\na lot with customers.\n\n141\n00:06:55.573 --> 00:06:58.696\nImagine for a minute that we're Amazon,\nDaniel and I.\n\n142\n00:06:58.696 --> 00:07:00.054\nI'm Am and he's Zon, right?\n\n143\n00:07:00.054 --> 00:07:01.993\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So imagine we're Amazon.\n\n144\n00:07:01.993 --> 00:07:05.315\nAnd imagine that we are providing\nall the services to you that Amazon\n\n145\n00:07:05.315 --> 00:07:06.750\nprovides, right?\n\n146\n00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.450\nEverything in the world\nyou can buy from them.\n\n147\n00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:10.660\nBy the way, I saw this.\n\n148\n00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:11.478\nThis is just one of our random asides.\n\n149\n00:07:11.478 --> 00:07:12.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Random aside for the day.\n\n150\n00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:13.927\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna call a quick time out,\nrandom aside.\n\n151\n00:07:13.927 --> 00:07:15.983\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Then we'll get back to business here.\n\n152\n00:07:15.983 --> 00:07:19.500\nBut this actually a really cool factoid\nwith regards to what we're talking about.\n\n153\n00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:24.420\nSo I read recently that if you were to buy\none of everything, on Amazon's website.\n\n154\n00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.079\nIt's currently available\nthrough their website.\n\n155\n00:07:26.079 --> 00:07:28.029\nYou know how much money it\nwould take you to buy one?\n\n156\n00:07:28.029 --> 00:07:29.550\nOne of everything they sell?\n\n157\n00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:30.548\n&gt;&gt; One of everything they sell.\n\n158\n00:07:30.548 --> 00:07:31.129\n&gt;&gt; One of everything they sell.\n\n159\n00:07:31.129 --> 00:07:34.845\n&gt;&gt; I'll make a wild guess and\nsay $2 billion.\n\n160\n00:07:34.845 --> 00:07:35.843\n&gt;&gt; You would be close sir.\n\n161\n00:07:35.843 --> 00:07:37.886\nYou would buy two thirds\nof what they had for sale.\n\n162\n00:07:37.886 --> 00:07:39.650\nThree billion.\n\n163\n00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.613\nThat's with a b,\nthat's McDonald's numbers right?\n\n164\n00:07:41.613 --> 00:07:46.907\nBillion sold, $3 billion to buy one of\neverything that they currently sell.\n\n165\n00:07:46.907 --> 00:07:49.308\nThat is a ridiculous amount of stuff.\n\n166\n00:07:49.308 --> 00:07:51.468\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot of stuff and\na lot of money to buy.\n\n167\n00:07:51.468 --> 00:07:53.245\n&gt;&gt; That's [CROSSTALK] a bunch of junk.\n\n168\n00:07:53.245 --> 00:07:54.800\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You'd have a bunch of everything.\n\n169\n00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.104\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You'd have\n\n170\n00:07:56.104 --> 00:07:57.345\nlots of good stuff and everything.\n\n171\n00:07:57.345 --> 00:07:59.524\nWhere would you store it?\nYou would need a $3 billion building.\n\n172\n00:07:59.524 --> 00:08:02.204\n&gt;&gt; You'd have to spend another 3\nbillion to store it all [CROSSTALK]\n\n173\n00:08:02.204 --> 00:08:04.623\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, but or rent space for\n\n174\n00:08:04.623 --> 00:08:05.128\nthem.\n\n175\n00:08:05.128 --> 00:08:06.092\n&gt;&gt; Just acquire Amazon.\n\n176\n00:08:06.092 --> 00:08:07.919\n&gt;&gt; The cloud.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, that's right.\n\n177\n00:08:07.919 --> 00:08:09.919\n&gt;&gt; You could buy it but\nnot actually take delivery.\n\n178\n00:08:09.919 --> 00:08:11.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n&gt;&gt; So it would stay in the cloud.\n\n179\n00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:12.820\nBut my point with Amazon is,\n\n180\n00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.279\nit's not that it takes $3 billion\nto buy everything they have.\n\n181\n00:08:15.279 --> 00:08:19.010\nBut rather, imagine we're Amazon,\nimagine we're providing services to you.\n\n182\n00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.070\nAnd imagine we have a service outage.\n\n183\n00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:25.280\nImagine the incident response of\na company like this, how highly honed and\n\n184\n00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.200\ndeveloped it is.\n\n185\n00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.100\nThis is a company, by the way,\nnot the only company but\n\n186\n00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:33.765\na company, that understands their revenue\nstream down to the penny and the second.\n\n187\n00:08:33.765 --> 00:08:37.445\nIf they have a disruption in their web\ntraffic, they're not making money.\n\n188\n00:08:37.445 --> 00:08:40.607\nBecause think about this,\nAmazon has, for the most part,\n\n189\n00:08:40.607 --> 00:08:42.767\nno brick and mortars on the retail side.\n\n190\n00:08:42.767 --> 00:08:44.515\nThey have pop-up stores,\nright, here and there.\n\n191\n00:08:44.515 --> 00:08:47.555\nBut essentially,\nyou don't walk into the Costco\n\n192\n00:08:47.555 --> 00:08:50.275\nmodel where they've got warehouses\nfull of stuff and you go buy.\n\n193\n00:08:50.275 --> 00:08:52.870\nThis is all smoke in mirrors,\nit's all up in the cloud.\n\n194\n00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:57.705\nSo if they can't get traffic in and out of\ntheir sites and they can't process orders,\n\n195\n00:08:57.705 --> 00:08:59.330\nthey're not making money.\n\n196\n00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.605\nAnd they know down to the penny and\nthe second what that disruption costs.\n\n197\n00:09:02.605 --> 00:09:04.630\nImagine incident response,\n\n198\n00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:06.760\nimagine being a fly on the wall\nin one of those meetings, right?\n\n199\n00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.290\nWeb is down, I mean,\nimagine in roughly November of last year,\n\n200\n00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:12.160\nthe Mirai botnet attack.\n\n201\n00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.147\nIt took down DNS in certain sectors\nof the country and the world.\n\n202\n00:09:16.147 --> 00:09:18.872\nAnd made it very difficult for\na period of about 24 hours for\n\n203\n00:09:18.872 --> 00:09:20.480\npeople to get on the web.\n\n204\n00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.720\nAmazon was affected, Netflix was affected.\n\n205\n00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.565\nMost of the major web-\n&gt;&gt; We were.\n\n206\n00:09:24.565 --> 00:09:27.480\n&gt;&gt; ITProTV was, lot of people were.\n\n207\n00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.420\nImagine the chaos, and the disruption, and\n\n208\n00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.680\nthe incident response that went\non at all these companies.\n\n209\n00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.892\nBut imagine sitting in Amazon's incident\nmanagement meeting around the fact that\n\n210\n00:09:35.892 --> 00:09:36.922\nthey were offline.\n\n211\n00:09:36.922 --> 00:09:40.702\nAnd how much money they're losing,\nevery second, every minute,\n\n212\n00:09:40.702 --> 00:09:42.440\nevery hour that they are down.\n\n213\n00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.542\nI mean, we're talking real money.\n\n214\n00:09:44.542 --> 00:09:46.654\nThat's not like peanuts,\nthat's a lot of money.\n\n215\n00:09:46.654 --> 00:09:48.835\n&gt;&gt; For\nthem downtime is a no no whatsoever,\n\n216\n00:09:48.835 --> 00:09:51.090\nbecause they are completely web driven.\n\n217\n00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:53.172\n&gt;&gt; You can't go offline,\nI mean, if you think about it,\n\n218\n00:09:53.172 --> 00:09:56.630\ntalk about the ultimate issues associated\nwith availability and redundancy.\n\n219\n00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:57.890\nWe talk about these terms.\n\n220\n00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:00.968\nBut this is a company that lives and\ndies by availability, right?\n\n221\n00:10:00.968 --> 00:10:02.960\nClearly, confidentiality\nintegrity as well.\n\n222\n00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.810\nDon't get me wrong, all three\nare vital to their business model.\n\n223\n00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:08.450\nBut if they don't have availability,\nthey're out of business.\n\n224\n00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:09.318\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I mean, that's it,\n\n225\n00:10:09.318 --> 00:10:10.960\nthey might as well shut down and\ngo home, right?\n\n226\n00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.190\nBecause there's nothing there.\n\n227\n00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:16.170\nSo when you think incident response on\nthis level, you gotta think about the fact\n\n228\n00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:19.400\nthat there are companies that this\nis what they plan for every day.\n\n229\n00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:23.370\nI mean, they drill on the assumption it's\ngonna happen and hope it never does.\n\n230\n00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:26.500\n&gt;&gt; I wonder how large that\nincident response team was that\n\n231\n00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.410\nhandled something like that?\n\n232\n00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:29.120\nAnd what they were gonna do,\nfigure that out?\n\n233\n00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:34.310\nDid they have even a procedure in\nplace for that level of an outage?\n\n234\n00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you've got to think, and\nI mean, this was a unique attack and\n\n235\n00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.270\nit still is reverberating through\nthe world even to this day.\n\n236\n00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:41.710\nThere's still chatter about it.\n\n237\n00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:46.210\nThere were subsequent attacks using\nthis botnet after the initial one.\n\n238\n00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:50.327\nThere are now software items out there\nthat in theory deal with the Mirai issue.\n\n239\n00:10:50.327 --> 00:10:54.060\nBut the reality is it still,\nit pointed out a huge liability for\n\n240\n00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:58.300\nus with regards to the architecture and\nthe design of certain systems.\n\n241\n00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:01.624\nDNS is incredibly resilient and\ndid not go offline, but\n\n242\n00:11:01.624 --> 00:11:06.840\nit became a bottleneck because of the DDOS\nattack against the infrastructure.\n\n243\n00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:11.050\nAnd the reality is, I'm sure companies\nlike that, Microsoft, Amazon,\n\n244\n00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:15.370\nGoogle, VMWare, Cisco, Citrix,\nall these companies, Oracle.\n\n245\n00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:18.059\nThat are in this cloud and\nin these provisioning businesses today,\n\n246\n00:11:18.059 --> 00:11:19.860\nthey've gotta plan for this stuff, right?\n\n247\n00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:23.401\nBecause you gotta think about the fact\nthat you've got a massive target,\n\n248\n00:11:23.401 --> 00:11:27.474\nmassive bullseye on the front end of your\nwebsites when you're a company like this.\n\n249\n00:11:27.474 --> 00:11:30.310\nBecause everybody in the world\nis looking to take you down.\n\n250\n00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:33.759\nI mean, this is the, the mountain you\nplant a flag on as hacker, that's it,\n\n251\n00:11:33.759 --> 00:11:34.834\nyou're done, right?\n\n252\n00:11:34.834 --> 00:11:35.725\nYou throw the microphone down.\n\n253\n00:11:35.725 --> 00:11:37.310\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n254\n00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:37.920\n&gt;&gt; Game over, right?\n\n255\n00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:41.600\nSo if they could take somebody\nlike this out, that's the goal.\n\n256\n00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:47.150\nWe talked about espionage and\ncyber espionage or information warfare.\n\n257\n00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:50.482\nIn one of our prior conversations\nwe defined the terminology for you,\n\n258\n00:11:50.482 --> 00:11:52.560\ntalked a bit about the idea behind it.\n\n259\n00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.627\nThe use of malware and/or\nsoftware to attack a system,\n\n260\n00:11:55.627 --> 00:11:58.310\nthe mitigation that needs\nto be involved there.\n\n261\n00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:01.380\nThe fact that governments may be\ninvolved in this kind of activity.\n\n262\n00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:04.830\nYou're seeing more and\nmore evidence of this all the time today.\n\n263\n00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:09.020\nNot just the shenanigans that went on\naround the US election in the last year,\n\n264\n00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.920\nbut more broadly, you look at,\ncertainly, China.\n\n265\n00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.120\nYou look at Russia, you look at\nNorth Korea, you look at the Israelis,\n\n266\n00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:20.360\nyou look at us, the United States,\nyou look at our European allies and NATO.\n\n267\n00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:23.445\nThere's so much stuff that goes on\nthat we just don't hear about, but\n\n268\n00:12:23.445 --> 00:12:25.802\nthatis happening behind\nthe scenes in this area.\n\n269\n00:12:25.802 --> 00:12:29.660\nAll of these countries have\ninformation cyber warfare divisions,\n\n270\n00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:30.779\nsome highly developed.\n\n271\n00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:35.740\nAll of them being used to gather and\ncreate recon and\n\n272\n00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:38.220\nintelligence opportunities for\ntheir governments.\n\n273\n00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.302\nMore often than not,\nbeing used in a passive way but\n\n274\n00:12:40.302 --> 00:12:43.555\nwe've seen ample evidence of the fact\nthey're also being used aggressively.\n\n275\n00:12:43.555 --> 00:12:47.750\nAnd openly, in some cases,\nto attack individuals or other areas.\n\n276\n00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:50.320\nOther entities with regards to\nhot spots around the world.\n\n277\n00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.370\nI mean, this is stuff that goes on,\n\n278\n00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:54.190\nthis is not the realm of science\nfiction in movies anymore, right?\n\n279\n00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:55.980\nThis is real and this is happening.\n\n280\n00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.980\nAnd this is the new battleground\nin the world today.\n\n281\n00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:00.830\nYou wanna go out and get a career and\n\n282\n00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:03.650\nunderstand how to do something\nincredibly interesting and exciting?\n\n283\n00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:07.170\nFigure out how to get into cyber defense\nand figure out how to take those skills\n\n284\n00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:09.790\nand go learn how to work for\none of these entities.\n\n285\n00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:13.400\nThe work you get to do is just\nunbelievably interesting and exciting, but\n\n286\n00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.700\nit's also highly secret.\n\n287\n00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.480\nYou don't get to talk about a lot of it,\nright?\n\n288\n00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.670\nBut it's the ultimate pinnacle for\nincident response, if you think about it.\n\n289\n00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:22.870\nThis is the bleeding edge of what\nwe're talking about doing today.\n\n290\n00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:25.800\nSo when you think about incident response,\nwe're thinking about, and\n\n291\n00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.000\nDaniel just pointed this out.\n\n292\n00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.270\nHow did the security teams respond?\n\n293\n00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:30.110\nWhat did that plan look like?\n\n294\n00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:31.760\nDid they anticipate that?\n\n295\n00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:36.100\nImagine having to draw up that BCP,\nDRP incident response plan.\n\n296\n00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:39.090\nAround a DNS outage that\naffects your systems when\n\n297\n00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:41.410\nyou're one of the largest\nretailers in the world on the web.\n\n298\n00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:44.867\nI mean, that's a hypothetical what if\nscenario that you sit in a room and\n\n299\n00:13:44.867 --> 00:13:47.312\nscratch your head and go,\ncould this even happen?\n\n300\n00:13:47.312 --> 00:13:49.328\nAnd if it does, where do I begin?\n\n301\n00:13:49.328 --> 00:13:50.102\n&gt;&gt; What do you do, yeah.\n\n302\n00:13:50.102 --> 00:13:51.598\n&gt;&gt; What do I do,\nhow do I address this, right?\n\n303\n00:13:51.598 --> 00:13:54.658\nBut somebody, a group of somebodies,\ncuz this isn't just one person.\n\n304\n00:13:54.658 --> 00:13:58.120\nA group of somebodies had to figure\nthis out, go through the logic and\n\n305\n00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.923\nthe planning cycles to have a plan.\n\n306\n00:13:59.923 --> 00:14:00.978\nBecause, as Amazon,\n\n307\n00:14:00.978 --> 00:14:04.539\nyou can't not have a plan because you\nknow at some point it's gonna happen.\n\n308\n00:14:04.539 --> 00:14:08.258\nAnd if you think about the logic of this,\nright,\n\n309\n00:14:08.258 --> 00:14:13.714\nyou can afford to go offline in many\nareas of the Amazon response chain.\n\n310\n00:14:13.714 --> 00:14:15.130\nBut you can't go offline on the front end.\n\n311\n00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:19.040\nIf you can still take orders in, and\nyou can accept payment, essentially.\n\n312\n00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.840\nBut then you slow down on the back end\nwith order processing, with shipping,\n\n313\n00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:23.630\nthings like that.\n\n314\n00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:25.997\nIn other words,\nyour supply chain backs up, but\n\n315\n00:14:25.997 --> 00:14:28.036\nyou are still accepting on the front end.\n\n316\n00:14:28.036 --> 00:14:31.125\nYou're probably okay cuz you have\na buffer for several days, right?\n\n317\n00:14:31.125 --> 00:14:33.565\nYou can apologize to people\nif shipping's a little late,\n\n318\n00:14:33.565 --> 00:14:35.525\nyou can offer them free shipping.\n\n319\n00:14:35.525 --> 00:14:37.245\nYou can give them a credit,\n\n320\n00:14:37.245 --> 00:14:39.775\nthere's stuff that you can do to\noffset some of those activities.\n\n321\n00:14:39.775 --> 00:14:42.085\nBut you can't offset the fact\nthat people wanna buy and\n\n322\n00:14:42.085 --> 00:14:44.375\nwhen they hit the buy button, they can't.\n\n323\n00:14:44.375 --> 00:14:48.055\nThey'll either go elsewhere or\nyou hope they come back at some point.\n\n324\n00:14:48.055 --> 00:14:49.330\nThey may not, who knows?\n\n325\n00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:53.520\nBut you can't absorb that and still make\nthat good in the eyes of the customer.\n\n326\n00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:54.840\nSo that's the one area where,\n\n327\n00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:59.750\nI'm sure without fail, they've done\ntremendous planning to figure it out.\n\n328\n00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:03.644\nYou may or may not know a lot about Amazon\nand we don't pick on any one company and\n\n329\n00:15:03.644 --> 00:15:05.131\nuse them as an example per se.\n\n330\n00:15:05.131 --> 00:15:07.625\nBut they happen to be an interesting\ncompany for a lot of reasons.\n\n331\n00:15:07.625 --> 00:15:10.977\nI don't know if you've ever heard\nof the concept of the Chaos Monkey?\n\n332\n00:15:10.977 --> 00:15:15.448\nSo the Chaos Monkey is the actual\nname of a software that Amazon uses.\n\n333\n00:15:15.448 --> 00:15:18.438\nThey developed it and\nthey use it to do stress testing and\n\n334\n00:15:18.438 --> 00:15:21.376\nsecurity testing on their\nsystems on a regular basis.\n\n335\n00:15:21.376 --> 00:15:24.760\nThey run this behind the scenes all\nthe time, looking for holes and\n\n336\n00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:27.433\nvulnerabilities and\nweaknesses and bottlenecks.\n\n337\n00:15:27.433 --> 00:15:30.963\nAnd then essentially they go out and\nthey, in real-time, mitigate this.\n\n338\n00:15:30.963 --> 00:15:35.197\nSo this is essentially a dynamic stress\ntest that they do on their systems all\n\n339\n00:15:35.197 --> 00:15:36.000\nthe time.\n\n340\n00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.160\nSo they're constantly, and\nthey're not the only company.\n\n341\n00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.670\nMicrosoft does this, all the big names\nwe just mentioned, they all do it.\n\n342\n00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:45.100\nBut the reality is that they\nare experts at this kinda stuff.\n\n343\n00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:46.460\nThis is what they do.\n\n344\n00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.260\nPeople look at a company like that and\nsay, they're great at selling stuff.\n\n345\n00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:50.528\nThey happen to sell stuff.\n\n346\n00:15:50.528 --> 00:15:54.798\nWhen I talk about companies like this,\nthey're companies that are excellent at\n\n347\n00:15:54.798 --> 00:15:57.325\nproject and process and\nincident management.\n\n348\n00:15:57.325 --> 00:16:00.511\nThat happen to also do other things\nbecause this is what they're\n\n349\n00:16:00.511 --> 00:16:01.340\nreally good at.\n\n350\n00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:01.967\nPeople don't realize that.\n\n351\n00:16:01.967 --> 00:16:05.056\nBut if they're not good at this, they're\nnot doing all the other stuff, right?\n\n352\n00:16:05.056 --> 00:16:06.155\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthe other stuff goes by the wayside.\n\n353\n00:16:06.155 --> 00:16:10.030\n&gt;&gt; They happen to sell stuff, because\nthey need to fund these activities.\n\n354\n00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:13.000\nBut if they're not good at this,\nat incident response,\n\n355\n00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.240\nthey're not selling anything, because\nthere's no way you're gonna get in, right?\n\n356\n00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.251\nSo what actions will carry\nout to minimize the damage.\n\n357\n00:16:18.251 --> 00:16:22.573\nHow security team reacts as well\nas how quickly we are able achieve\n\n358\n00:16:22.573 --> 00:16:26.907\nrestoration of service these\nare the key roadmap markers right?\n\n359\n00:16:26.907 --> 00:16:27.784\nThe key flags or\n\n360\n00:16:27.784 --> 00:16:32.445\nmilestone we gotta look at with regards to\ninstance response these are the markers\n\n361\n00:16:32.445 --> 00:16:36.582\nthe tell signs right about successful\ninstance responses are gonna be.\n\n362\n00:16:36.582 --> 00:16:40.891\nWe generally think about instant response,\nincluding all things we talked about.\n\n363\n00:16:40.891 --> 00:16:43.940\nIt's got to have the step-by-step\nresponse plan, as Daniel pointed out.\n\n364\n00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.743\nIt's got to have the resources,\nand the capacity and\n\n365\n00:16:46.743 --> 00:16:48.806\nthe capability to execute on the plan.\n\n366\n00:16:48.806 --> 00:16:51.764\nIt's got to have broad awareness\nof communication of what everybody\n\n367\n00:16:51.764 --> 00:16:52.740\nneeds to do.\n\n368\n00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:57.299\nWe got to ensure maximization of\nrestoration, minimization of interruption,\n\n369\n00:16:57.299 --> 00:16:58.979\nas part of the response plan.\n\n370\n00:16:58.979 --> 00:17:01.520\nYou've got to get back to\nnormal as quickly as possible.\n\n371\n00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.800\nWe've gotta be able to exercise\ndue care and due diligence and\n\n372\n00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.690\nroot cause analysis to\nlearn from our mistakes and\n\n373\n00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:10.180\nensure they don't get propagated and\nrepeat themselves.\n\n374\n00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:13.700\nSo we've gotta take the knowledge\nwe gain from incident response,\n\n375\n00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.480\nturn it into, essentially,\nproactive planning for\n\n376\n00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:20.190\nthe next cycle, to plug those gaps,\ntake care of those vulnerabilities.\n\n377\n00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:23.700\nAnd ultimately, stop the same activity\nfrom happening again and again.\n\n378\n00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:25.720\nWe have to break that cycle.\n\n379\n00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:28.350\nAnd we have to have, as Daniel also\npointed out, legal preparation or\n\n380\n00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:32.840\npreparedness to be able to prosecute\na attack in a court of law if we\n\n381\n00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:37.080\ncan prove that there was malfeasance and\nwrongdoing that violated the law.\n\n382\n00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.520\nSo incident response has\nto address all these areas.\n\n383\n00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.082\nAnd we have to respond in\na forensically sound way,\n\n384\n00:17:43.082 --> 00:17:46.190\nwe'll talk more about this in\nsome upcoming conversations.\n\n385\n00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:50.750\nI'd encourage you to cross pollinate this\nknowledge with our CHFI conversations that\n\n386\n00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:54.998\nwe've had about incident response and\nultimately forensic investigations and\n\n387\n00:17:54.998 --> 00:17:57.090\nforensic handling of evidence.\n\n388\n00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:00.367\nBut you've got to understand that\ninstance responses isn't just as Daniel\n\n389\n00:18:00.367 --> 00:18:01.220\njoked about.\n\n390\n00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:03.214\nHold my beer and\nwatch what happens, right?\n\n391\n00:18:03.214 --> 00:18:06.450\nGo over there, and let's just bust\nthe place up and stop what's going on.\n\n392\n00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:10.691\nNot that he was indicating that would\nhappen, just joking around about it, but\n\n393\n00:18:10.691 --> 00:18:13.304\nthe reality is It's a lot\nmore than just show up.\n\n394\n00:18:13.304 --> 00:18:15.367\nAnd throw the bad guy against the wall,\nand\n\n395\n00:18:15.367 --> 00:18:19.370\nmake sure that we don't have too much\nof a bar fight, that wrecks everything.\n\n396\n00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:22.309\nYou got into a lot more than that, as a\nmatter of fact, we've gotta be meticulous.\n\n397\n00:18:22.309 --> 00:18:26.357\nAnd methodical with regards to how we\napproach that incident from the time we're\n\n398\n00:18:26.357 --> 00:18:30.226\nmade aware of it till the time that it\nis officially declared over and we're,\n\n399\n00:18:30.226 --> 00:18:32.212\nin theory, hopefully back to normal.\n\n400\n00:18:32.212 --> 00:18:33.975\n&gt;&gt; Cuz this is a details game, right?\n\n401\n00:18:33.975 --> 00:18:35.635\n&gt;&gt; This is all about details, yeah.\n\n402\n00:18:35.635 --> 00:18:39.130\nIf we're not methodical and\nwe're not planning\n\n403\n00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:42.900\nour five steps ahead thought processes\nas to what we're going to do.\n\n404\n00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:47.086\nWe're gonna make a mistake that's very\nlikely to cause us to not be able to bring\n\n405\n00:18:47.086 --> 00:18:51.170\nthis case to trial and that may or may\nnot be a big deal at the end of the day.\n\n406\n00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:53.060\nNot every incident, response,\n\n407\n00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.650\nnot every investigation needs\nto end in a court of law but\n\n408\n00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:59.330\nwe have to understand that the likelihood\nand probability of that is high.\n\n409\n00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:04.655\nEspecially if there is a significant\ndollar value associated with the damage,\n\n410\n00:19:04.655 --> 00:19:09.982\nif there is significant disruption and\nor loss of confidentiality or integrity\n\n411\n00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:15.164\nthat may violate some sort of either\nlegal or regulatory compliance regime.\n\n412\n00:19:15.164 --> 00:19:19.933\nThen we are most likely looking at a\nresponse that will involve us some sort of\n\n413\n00:19:19.933 --> 00:19:21.509\nlegal issue or concern.\n\n414\n00:19:21.509 --> 00:19:25.353\nAnd if that's the case and we make even\nthe slightest mistake because we're\n\n415\n00:19:25.353 --> 00:19:29.556\nnot methodical and we're not planning and\nwe're not paying attention to detail,\n\n416\n00:19:29.556 --> 00:19:33.950\nthen we are, if we're not meticulous,\nwe're gonna suffer the consequences.\n\n417\n00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:36.700\nI've seen a lot of investigations\ngo sideways with regards to\n\n418\n00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:41.310\nincidence response because, not because\nthings were done in an inappropriate or\n\n419\n00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:43.870\nincorrect way, but\nbecause they were done out of order.\n\n420\n00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:44.790\nBelive it or not.\n\n421\n00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:48.480\nAnd somebody went and said, okay hey,\nlet's safeguard this system.\n\n422\n00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:52.140\nLet's unplug it, let's just isolate it\nlike you were suggesting we would do.\n\n423\n00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.320\nAbsolutely correct, but they did so\n\n424\n00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:58.370\nbefore they had figured out that there was\na methodology that had to be followed.\n\n425\n00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:02.290\nThat they had a photograph and document\nall the evidence in current state, so\n\n426\n00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:03.700\nthat once they unplugged it and\n\n427\n00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:07.580\nessentially safeguarded it that we\ncould reconstruct what was going on.\n\n428\n00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:11.810\nAnd something as small as that and\nexecution of a process that out of order,\n\n429\n00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:16.780\nout of sequence can lead to\nthe of evidence and that's a huge\n\n430\n00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:20.740\nissue on our community and what we do in\nterms of what we are talking about here.\n\n431\n00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:22.840\nIt's a big, big deal for us,\nwe go to think about that and\n\n432\n00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.630\nobviously we wanna make sure\nwe're aware of those things.\n\n433\n00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:28.960\nSo the step by step response\nplan very very important for\n\n434\n00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:33.260\nus to be knowledgeable about, be trained\non, be executing on regular basis.\n\n435\n00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:34.910\nPractice, practice, practice, right.\n\n436\n00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:39.610\nPractice mom and dad always used to\nsay practice make perfect, right and\n\n437\n00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:43.640\nIf we're not aware, if we're not training,\nif we're not practicing, chances are good\n\n438\n00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.480\nwhen the time comes for the big show,\nwe're gonna forget something.\n\n439\n00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:49.535\nThat's just the reality\nof what we have to do.\n\n440\n00:20:49.535 --> 00:20:52.088\nAs I've shared with you,\nI travel a great deal,\n\n441\n00:20:52.088 --> 00:20:54.780\nespecially these days I've\nbeen traveling a lot.\n\n442\n00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:57.987\nEvery so often, I don't know if you ever\nhave one of these moments, I have them,\n\n443\n00:20:57.987 --> 00:21:00.691\nI find, a little bit more as I get\nolder than I did when I was younger.\n\n444\n00:21:00.691 --> 00:21:04.579\nBut I'm in strange hotels on\na regular basis in foreign countries\n\n445\n00:21:04.579 --> 00:21:07.335\ndoing what I do I travel\nall over the world, and\n\n446\n00:21:07.335 --> 00:21:11.810\nI was just out of the country right before\nI came here to do this set of shows.\n\n447\n00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:14.260\nAnd I'm gonna be out of the country\nagain in about three weeks.\n\n448\n00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:16.390\nAnd so I mean I travel a great deal and\n\n449\n00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:20.350\nwhen I was travelling the last trip I\nwoke up one night in a hotel maybe two,\n\n450\n00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:26.340\nthree in the morning and I sat up in bed\nand I had to think of myself for a second.\n\n451\n00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:28.368\nWhere am I what time zone am I in.\n\n452\n00:21:28.368 --> 00:21:30.690\nAnd what the hell am I doing here right.\n\n453\n00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:32.371\nBecause I just, I don't.\n\n454\n00:21:32.371 --> 00:21:36.162\nYou just, you sometimes you do so much\nthat you forget what you're doing right.\n\n455\n00:21:36.162 --> 00:21:39.715\nYou've got to think about the fact that\nif you practice on a regular basis and\n\n456\n00:21:39.715 --> 00:21:42.340\nbecome second nature it's\neasier to think about that.\n\n457\n00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:45.480\nI literally have to think ahead, okay,\nwhere am I going to be next week.\n\n458\n00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.560\nWho am I working for,\nwhat am I gonna be doing?\n\n459\n00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.120\nAnd I gotta make sure I'm\nprepared all the time,\n\n460\n00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.220\nbecause I'm not doing\nthe same thing every week.\n\n461\n00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:55.110\nI'm doing a variety of things\nin a huge number of areas.\n\n462\n00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:58.080\nInfrastructure, data center management,\n\n463\n00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.060\ncloud security,\nall this stuff I work with and work in.\n\n464\n00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:02.100\nAnd it's different every week.\n\n465\n00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.680\nIn some cases,\nmultiple things in a week, right?\n\n466\n00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.740\nIf I'm helping a client to build out\na data center, I'm doing five or\n\n467\n00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:08.930\nsix different things at once.\n\n468\n00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:12.620\nIf I'm dealing with incident response and\nauditing for a customer, I'm dealing with\n\n469\n00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:16.190\na bunch of different stuff from different\ndisciplines and it's not all one thing.\n\n470\n00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:19.235\nI don't just, literally as some people do,\njust do one or\n\n471\n00:22:19.235 --> 00:22:22.542\ntwo things on a regular basis based\non the kind of job they have.\n\n472\n00:22:22.542 --> 00:22:26.398\nSo it's that variety that's to me, very\nexciting but also leads to the, hey where\n\n473\n00:22:26.398 --> 00:22:28.476\nam I and what am I doing, moments\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n474\n00:22:28.476 --> 00:22:29.280\n&gt;&gt; Every so often.\n\n475\n00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.221\nYou gotta plan, you gotta make\nsure you know what you're doing.\n\n476\n00:22:31.221 --> 00:22:32.120\nIncident handling.\n\n477\n00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.040\nWe talked about this as well.\n\n478\n00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.160\nWe're just talking a little\nbit about incident response.\n\n479\n00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.100\nThe two are essentially\nsides of the same coin.\n\n480\n00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:38.910\nIncident response,\n\n481\n00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:42.550\nincident handling, are really parts\nof what we call incident management.\n\n482\n00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:45.270\nAnd they kinda hang underneath\nincident management.\n\n483\n00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:48.263\nSet of procedures and\npolicies that we use to prepare for\n\n484\n00:22:48.263 --> 00:22:52.539\nand execute our response to incidents or\nwhat incident handling's all about.\n\n485\n00:22:52.539 --> 00:22:56.086\n[LAUGH] It can be mean that I may not get\nbored on occasion when I'm doing these\n\n486\n00:22:56.086 --> 00:22:59.575\nkind of things, but reality is it also\nmeans that I have to pay attention to\n\n487\n00:22:59.575 --> 00:23:01.640\ndetail and really be meticulous, right.\n\n488\n00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:03.841\nAnd unfortunately,\nI don't have apps for that anymore.\n\n489\n00:23:03.841 --> 00:23:06.068\nWe talked about because Blackberry\nis getting me out of the hey,\n\n490\n00:23:06.068 --> 00:23:07.192\nwe're making phone business.\n\n491\n00:23:07.192 --> 00:23:09.397\nSo, I've gotta come up with a new plan for\nthat.\n\n492\n00:23:09.397 --> 00:23:10.599\nAnother random aside by the way.\n\n493\n00:23:10.599 --> 00:23:12.886\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] My kids are constantly hawking\n\n494\n00:23:12.886 --> 00:23:17.118\nme, hey you gotta get an iPhone, you gotta\nget an iPhone cuz that's what they have.\n\n495\n00:23:17.118 --> 00:23:20.381\nSo, keep saying to me,\nlook this is what I've chosen, and for\n\n496\n00:23:20.381 --> 00:23:22.055\n20 years it's been great me.\n\n497\n00:23:22.055 --> 00:23:25.421\nIt's a business platform, Blackberry,\nyou've heard me rant about it before in\n\n498\n00:23:25.421 --> 00:23:28.430\nprior conversations, and\nI'm committed to this platform.\n\n499\n00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:32.040\nSo I'm excited about the fact that they\nannounced the new phone this last week.\n\n500\n00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:35.000\nThat although it's gonna be Android based,\nwhich is not a bad thing at all.\n\n501\n00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.170\nBut that they're still\ncommitted to having a platform.\n\n502\n00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:39.590\nSo I can keep saying no\nthank you to Apple, and\n\n503\n00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:42.090\nI can keep working with\nmy beloved Blackberry.\n\n504\n00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:43.650\nCuz I do love them so much.\n\n505\n00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:46.530\nSo when we think about\nincident handling and we think\n\n506\n00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:51.123\nabout this set of procedures and policies\nand processes that we wanna come up with.\n\n507\n00:23:51.123 --> 00:23:54.709\nThe key here documentation right we gotta\nthink about the fact we have to write\n\n508\n00:23:54.709 --> 00:23:55.670\nthings down.\n\n509\n00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:59.116\nWe gotta know what we are gonna do have\nan authoratative repository of knowledge.\n\n510\n00:23:59.116 --> 00:24:02.993\nBe able to go there and say definitively\nhey it says step one do this step two do\n\n511\n00:24:02.993 --> 00:24:06.929\nthis step three call this person and step\nfour this is what we need to expect And\n\n512\n00:24:06.929 --> 00:24:10.506\nif that's not followed, we should\nbe able to have responsibility and\n\n513\n00:24:10.506 --> 00:24:13.508\naccountability around that and\nunderstand why, right?\n\n514\n00:24:13.508 --> 00:24:16.575\nWhen we wing it, so to speak, quote,\nunquote, is when we get in trouble,\n\n515\n00:24:16.575 --> 00:24:17.277\nin other words.\n\n516\n00:24:17.277 --> 00:24:19.873\nAnd within some handling,\nwe don't wanna wing things, right?\n\n517\n00:24:19.873 --> 00:24:23.963\nWe gotta have a prioritized set of plans,\nand an execution thought\n\n518\n00:24:23.963 --> 00:24:29.068\nprocess around them that's gonna lead us\nto be successful no matter what it is.\n\n519\n00:24:29.068 --> 00:24:32.420\nWe've got to include procedures not\njust for handling, but also, for\n\n520\n00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:34.980\non the flip side,\nreporting on what we've done, and\n\n521\n00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:39.830\nmaking sure that stakeholders are aware\nof our progress at all times.\n\n522\n00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:43.770\nIt is so important for\nus to be able to, not only report, but\n\n523\n00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:49.810\nto report at an audience relevance level,\nmeaning that we share information in a way\n\n524\n00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:53.410\nthat the people we're communicating\nwith understand the importance of it and\n\n525\n00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:58.130\ncan make decisions and have insights based\non that knowledge that are meaningful and\n\n526\n00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:59.300\nrelevant to them.\n\n527\n00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:02.888\nNothing worse than sitting in a room\nhaving a conversation with a customer,\n\n528\n00:25:02.888 --> 00:25:04.579\na stakeholder, whoever it may be.\n\n529\n00:25:04.579 --> 00:25:07.865\nA student, whatever the relationship is,\nand they have that glassy,\n\n530\n00:25:07.865 --> 00:25:11.453\nkinda doe-eyed look, like you know\nthey're there but they're not there.\n\n531\n00:25:11.453 --> 00:25:13.490\nThey're just not getting it, right?\n\n532\n00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:15.103\nThat's just horrible, right?\n\n533\n00:25:15.103 --> 00:25:17.630\nAnd as a result we're just\nnot reaching our audience.\n\n534\n00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:21.418\nWe're talking above them or\nbelow them, or maybe through them, but\n\n535\n00:25:21.418 --> 00:25:23.588\nwe're not talking with them, right?\n\n536\n00:25:23.588 --> 00:25:28.675\nAnd this is the thing that we really need\nto understand as security professionals,\n\n537\n00:25:28.675 --> 00:25:33.919\nas IT administrators, as people that wanna\nbe doing what we do as incident handlers.\n\n538\n00:25:33.919 --> 00:25:37.399\nIf you're not able to create relevancy\nin the mind of your customer,\n\n539\n00:25:37.399 --> 00:25:41.539\nthe mind of your stakeholder, the mind of\nthe person you are working on behalf of,\n\n540\n00:25:41.539 --> 00:25:42.980\nyou're not doing your job.\n\n541\n00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:46.546\nI don't care how good you are at\nthe tactical execution of all the things\n\n542\n00:25:46.546 --> 00:25:47.744\nwe're talking about.\n\n543\n00:25:47.744 --> 00:25:49.854\nThat's all good, and\nthere's nothing wrong with that.\n\n544\n00:25:49.854 --> 00:25:51.013\nYou've gotta be good at that stuff.\n\n545\n00:25:51.013 --> 00:25:53.450\nBut, that's the easy part,\nbelieve it or not, right?\n\n546\n00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:57.557\nThe hard part is translating that into\na story that tells the people that\n\n547\n00:25:57.557 --> 00:26:00.843\nare asking for\ncommunication what the status update is in\n\n548\n00:26:00.843 --> 00:26:03.797\na relevant way they can latch onto and\nunderstand.\n\n549\n00:26:03.797 --> 00:26:08.769\nAnd if you're not able to do that,\nthen that's a skill you can learn.\n\n550\n00:26:08.769 --> 00:26:11.130\nWe called it soft skills when\nwe were chatting offline, right?\n\n551\n00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:13.030\nSoft skills are business skills.\n\n552\n00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:14.970\nThat's the kinda thing you've gotta learn.\n\n553\n00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:18.098\nOne of the most important skills you\ncan have an an incident handler and\n\n554\n00:26:18.098 --> 00:26:21.547\na security professional is understanding\nhow to communicate efficiently,\n\n555\n00:26:21.547 --> 00:26:24.107\neffectively, and\nrelevantly to the people around you.\n\n556\n00:26:24.107 --> 00:26:26.410\nAll the other stuff we\ncan teach you how to do.\n\n557\n00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:27.320\nUsing tools?\n\n558\n00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:28.315\nIt's hard, don't get me wrong.\n\n559\n00:26:28.315 --> 00:26:29.791\nBut, you can learn how to do that.\n\n560\n00:26:29.791 --> 00:26:31.430\nYou can learn programming languages.\n\n561\n00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:32.484\nYou can learn how to script.\n\n562\n00:26:32.484 --> 00:26:34.180\nBut, if you don't know\nhow to talk to people.\n\n563\n00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:37.870\nUnfortunately, we don't work\nin an isolated environment.\n\n564\n00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:38.990\nWe don't work in a bubble.\n\n565\n00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:41.950\nWe're not those people that are in\nthe shadows all the time that nobody sees.\n\n566\n00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:45.680\nWe're the face and the voice of\nincident response in the organization.\n\n567\n00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:48.920\nWe're on the front lines and\npeople are going to wanna talk to us,\n\n568\n00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:52.040\nand they're gonna wanna\nunderstand what we're doing.\n\n569\n00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.940\nAnd if we can't tell that compelling\nstory, it's gonna be very difficult for\n\n570\n00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:57.350\nus [LAUGH] to do that, right?\n\n571\n00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:58.225\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n572\n00:26:58.225 --> 00:27:01.015\nWe've gotta be able to make\nrecommendations and provide strategies and\n\n573\n00:27:01.015 --> 00:27:03.309\nguidance as a part of incident handling,\nvery important.\n\n574\n00:27:03.309 --> 00:27:05.925\nHow do we estimate the cost\nof an incident, right?\n\n575\n00:27:05.925 --> 00:27:09.045\nWhen we think about it, I was talking\nabout this with Amazon a little bit ago.\n\n576\n00:27:09.045 --> 00:27:11.649\nThey know down to the second and\nthe penny what it costs them, right?\n\n577\n00:27:11.649 --> 00:27:14.679\nWe're talking about tangible\nversus intangible costs,\n\n578\n00:27:14.679 --> 00:27:18.088\nbeing able to understand the tangible,\nthe hard costs, right?\n\n579\n00:27:18.088 --> 00:27:21.848\nThe dollars and cents, as we were\ntalking about, but also the intangible,\n\n580\n00:27:21.848 --> 00:27:23.625\nthe impact to reputation, right?\n\n581\n00:27:23.625 --> 00:27:26.649\nAnd the impact to perception\nin the mind of the customer.\n\n582\n00:27:26.649 --> 00:27:29.775\nThese are important concepts\nthat we have to think about and\n\n583\n00:27:29.775 --> 00:27:34.090\nunderstand how to manage as incident\nresponders because we're making decisions\n\n584\n00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:38.592\nabout restoring services and about the\nimpact to confidentiality, integrity, and\n\n585\n00:27:38.592 --> 00:27:41.217\navailability in the business\nthat have direct and\n\n586\n00:27:41.217 --> 00:27:44.370\nindirect consequences to\nthe viability of that business.\n\n587\n00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:47.542\nAnd if we're not making the right\ndecisions because we don't\n\n588\n00:27:47.542 --> 00:27:48.823\nunderstand the impact,\n\n589\n00:27:48.823 --> 00:27:52.730\nwe may be making mistakes that can\nliterally lead to a business going under.\n\n590\n00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:53.667\nThey could go out of business.\n\n591\n00:27:53.667 --> 00:27:58.147\nAnd I've seen that happen, unfortunately,\nwith regards to incident response, where\n\n592\n00:27:58.147 --> 00:28:02.044\nincident response has not been aligned\nwith business need and requirement.\n\n593\n00:28:02.044 --> 00:28:05.792\nAnd down the road those decisions have led\nto that business losing faith from their\n\n594\n00:28:05.792 --> 00:28:08.300\ncustomers and, ultimately,\ngoing out of business.\n\n595\n00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:11.020\nThat's a really big deal when\nyou think about it, right?\n\n596\n00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.730\nWe talked about needing incident\nreporting and why it is so\n\n597\n00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:17.060\nimportant, why audience relevancy is so\nimportant.\n\n598\n00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:18.660\nIt's the process of gathering information,\n\n599\n00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:20.750\ncommunicating it broadly\nout to everything.\n\n600\n00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:23.410\nWhat are things that should be included\nin that audience relevance statement\n\n601\n00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:24.350\nand that report?\n\n602\n00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:27.879\nCertainly, a summary executive\nhigh-level vision of what's gone on.\n\n603\n00:28:27.879 --> 00:28:31.770\nSo, the particulars, or as they used to\nsay on Dragnet, just the facts ma'am.\n\n604\n00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:34.454\nSo, you wanna think about that.\n\n605\n00:28:34.454 --> 00:28:36.174\nThe intensity of the breach,\nin other words.\n\n606\n00:28:36.174 --> 00:28:38.519\nWanna tell that story,\nhelp us to understand it.\n\n607\n00:28:38.519 --> 00:28:44.268\nCircumstances that led to revolution, or,\nexcuse me, the revealing of revolution.\n\n608\n00:28:44.268 --> 00:28:45.181\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You wanna have revolution.\n\n609\n00:28:45.181 --> 00:28:47.085\nThe revealing of the vulnerability.\n\n610\n00:28:47.085 --> 00:28:49.660\nAnd of course,\nthe uncovering of the incident, right?\n\n611\n00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:52.510\nSo, we wanna understand the story\nbehind it, what led up to it,\n\n612\n00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:56.290\nwhat the circumstances were, in effect,\nand tell that story, lay that out.\n\n613\n00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:59.570\nWanna understand the shortcomings in the\narchitecture and the design that may have\n\n614\n00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:03.150\nled to the weakness, so we can identify\nthe places where we need to bring\n\n615\n00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:08.250\nmitigation and some sort of recovery\ncapability to and change what's going on.\n\n616\n00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:12.880\nSo we may have to document what's called\nESA, the Enterprise Security Architecture,\n\n617\n00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.800\nand understand then how to\nplace flags on those areas,\n\n618\n00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.400\nright, where we have uncovered\nweaknesses and address those.\n\n619\n00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.907\nSo, wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n620\n00:29:19.907 --> 00:29:23.060\nAny log activity and logs that may\nbe related to the intruder and\n\n621\n00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:25.515\nthe intruder activity\nshould be at least cited.\n\n622\n00:29:25.515 --> 00:29:29.291\nWe don't need page after page\nof detailed log entries.\n\n623\n00:29:29.291 --> 00:29:33.564\nBut, we wanna know, hey, this firewall log\nfrom this device during this time period,\n\n624\n00:29:33.564 --> 00:29:35.860\nthat's where we need to focus our effort.\n\n625\n00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:37.940\nThat's where we found\nevidence of the breach, and\n\n626\n00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:41.160\nwe wanna have a forensically\nsound capture and copy of that.\n\n627\n00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.868\nAnd we wanna then know that that\nsafeguard is part of the outcome of\n\n628\n00:29:43.868 --> 00:29:44.766\nthe investigation.\n\n629\n00:29:44.766 --> 00:29:47.840\nAnd we wanna have, most importantly,\nand people often miss this.\n\n630\n00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:51.900\nWhat do you think the number one thing is\nwith regards to incident reporting and\n\n631\n00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:54.249\nresponse that we need\nto ensure is accurate?\n\n632\n00:29:54.249 --> 00:29:55.097\nWhat would you say if I asked?\n\n633\n00:29:55.097 --> 00:29:56.209\nWhat do you think the number one thing is?\n\n634\n00:29:56.209 --> 00:29:57.081\n&gt;&gt; Let’s see here.\n\n635\n00:29:57.081 --> 00:30:01.683\nI'd guess its some form of integrity to\nthe actual proof that we're collecting.\n\n636\n00:30:01.683 --> 00:30:08.427\nSo, maybe a hashing algorithm\nagainst the those things?\n\n637\n00:30:08.427 --> 00:30:09.996\nSo, Daniel's in the right area.\n\n638\n00:30:09.996 --> 00:30:12.802\nHe's kind of in the ballpark, but\nhe's circling around the one thing.\n\n639\n00:30:12.802 --> 00:30:13.860\nAnd he made a great guess.\n\n640\n00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:16.904\nHe said, hashing to provide integrity,\nand that's definitely up there.\n\n641\n00:30:16.904 --> 00:30:18.080\nThere's no doubt about it.\n\n642\n00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.938\nBut, what people often miss with this,\nright?\n\n643\n00:30:19.938 --> 00:30:22.570\nWe can create integrity and hash evidence.\n\n644\n00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:27.692\nBut, if we can't validate that across our\nsystems, everything was done at the proper\n\n645\n00:30:27.692 --> 00:30:32.393\nmoment in time or it seems to be in line\nbecause of NTP, Network Time Protocol and\n\n646\n00:30:32.393 --> 00:30:35.510\ntime synchronization,\nthen we may have a problem.\n\n647\n00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:39.496\nBecause unless we're dealing with one\nsystem in one locale and it's isolated,\n\n648\n00:30:39.496 --> 00:30:42.614\nthere typically are multiple\nsystems involved in the breach.\n\n649\n00:30:42.614 --> 00:30:47.156\nAnd if those time synchronization events\nhave been decoupled that's usually part of\n\n650\n00:30:47.156 --> 00:30:51.318\nthe attack, ultimately, and leads to\nother concerns because now logs may not\n\n651\n00:30:51.318 --> 00:30:54.239\nbe accurate because they may\nhave been tampered with.\n\n652\n00:30:54.239 --> 00:30:58.288\nAnd the time stamping that takes place\nmay not be accurate on purpose to hide\n\n653\n00:30:58.288 --> 00:30:59.430\nactivity.\n\n654\n00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:00.990\nAnd we may have decoupled and\n\n655\n00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:05.605\ndesynchronized time synchronization in\nsystems that may lead to lack of services,\n\n656\n00:31:05.605 --> 00:31:09.570\nsuch as the ability to logon an\nauthenticate in an LDAP directory through\n\n657\n00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:13.993\nKerberos or other systems is impacted\nby time synchronization being modified.\n\n658\n00:31:13.993 --> 00:31:17.240\nSo, we would look at and want to ensure\nthe use of time synchronization,\n\n659\n00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:20.080\nas well as what you suggested,\ncuz you're absolutely right.\n\n660\n00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.953\nIt's right up there, almost neck and\nneck with time synchronization.\n\n661\n00:31:22.953 --> 00:31:24.483\nIntegrity and hashing, or\n\n662\n00:31:24.483 --> 00:31:29.147\ndigitally signing of evidence to ensure\nlack of monkey business going on, right?\n\n663\n00:31:29.147 --> 00:31:30.673\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We don't wanna play with that evidence.\n\n664\n00:31:30.673 --> 00:31:32.790\nWe want it to be forensically sound.\n\n665\n00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:36.379\nAnd Daniel's discussion around the idea\nthat hashing would allow us to do that is\n\n666\n00:31:36.379 --> 00:31:37.606\ngonna be accurate as well.\n\n667\n00:31:37.606 --> 00:31:40.799\nBut NTP, Network Time Protocol,\nthe use of it in time synchronization,\n\n668\n00:31:40.799 --> 00:31:44.456\nnumber one issue we have to address, with\nregards to incident response handling and\n\n669\n00:31:44.456 --> 00:31:47.083\nmanaging of incidents overall,\nwhen we look at evidence and\n\n670\n00:31:47.083 --> 00:31:49.578\nforensically sound gathering\nprocedures around that.\n\n671\n00:31:49.578 --> 00:31:51.663\nSo, it's kinda some interesting\nstuff when you think about it.\n\n672\n00:31:51.663 --> 00:31:52.423\n&gt;&gt; It is very interesting.\n\n673\n00:31:52.423 --> 00:31:55.072\nI would not have thought about NTP,\nbut you're right.\n\n674\n00:31:55.072 --> 00:31:56.191\nIt's very important.\n\n675\n00:31:56.191 --> 00:31:58.507\nIf you can't verify the time\nthen you can just say, well,\n\n676\n00:31:58.507 --> 00:32:00.607\nyou just made that whenever\nyou felt like making it.\n\n677\n00:32:00.607 --> 00:32:01.927\n&gt;&gt; And we don't know when\nthe attack may have occurred.\n\n678\n00:32:01.927 --> 00:32:03.240\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; It may have occurred at 2\n\n679\n00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.071\no'clock local time.\n\n680\n00:32:04.071 --> 00:32:05.608\nBut, that may be, essentially,\n\n681\n00:32:05.608 --> 00:32:08.260\na red herring that we put in there\nto make it look like it did.\n\n682\n00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:10.087\nWhen, in fact, it occurred two days or\nthree days prior.\n\n683\n00:32:10.087 --> 00:32:10.591\nWho knows?\n\n684\n00:32:10.591 --> 00:32:12.801\nAt that point, in other words,\nanything is possible and\n\n685\n00:32:12.801 --> 00:32:15.853\nwe have no way of authoritatively saying\nexactly when the incident occurred.\n\n686\n00:32:15.853 --> 00:32:16.799\nThat's the issue.\n\n687\n00:32:16.799 --> 00:32:17.452\nThat's the challenge.\n\n688\n00:32:17.452 --> 00:32:18.556\n&gt;&gt; That's very cool.\n\n689\n00:32:18.556 --> 00:32:20.573\nWell, that being said,\nI'm looking at our clock.\n\n690\n00:32:20.573 --> 00:32:23.892\nAnd now, we've had a very\ngood foundational knowledge,\n\n691\n00:32:23.892 --> 00:32:27.751\na body of knowledge built up that,\nhopefully, you guys will be able\n\n692\n00:32:27.751 --> 00:32:32.220\nto springboard off of and move in to our\nnext few episodes, avoiding that whole\n\n693\n00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:36.855\ndecapitated poultry syndrome that plagues\nmany of us, [LAUGH] from time to time.\n\n694\n00:32:36.855 --> 00:32:38.950\nThat being said, Adam,\nthank you for joining us today.\n\n695\n00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:41.296\nWe do thank our good viewers for watching.\n\n696\n00:32:41.296 --> 00:32:45.295\nBut, that being said, it is that time for\nus to sign off for ITProTV.\n\n697\n00:32:45.295 --> 00:32:46.985\nI've been your host Daniel

everyone.\n\n7\n00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:16.813\nAnd welcome to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.813 --> 00:00:18.510\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n9\n00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.260\nAnd in today's episode,\nwe are back with more on our,\n\n10\n00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.850\nwhat is it, the ECEIH incident handler,\nthat's right.\n\n11\n00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.410\nThat's the series we're\nworking with today.\n\n12\n00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.000\nAnd of course, joining me in the studio,\nour good friend, Mr Adam Gordon.\n\n13\n00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.970\nAdam, welcome back man.\n\n14\n00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.010\nHow's it going today?\n\n15\n00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.393\n&gt;&gt; Good, good, there was a risk there\nthat you were gonna get that wrong.\n\n16\n00:00:35.393 --> 00:00:36.224\nI thought we were gonna be-\n&gt;&gt; There's so\n\n17\n00:00:36.224 --> 00:00:37.018\nmany acronym\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n18\n00:00:37.018 --> 00:00:38.280\n&gt;&gt; Certified chicken pluckers or\n\n19\n00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.400\nsomething today.\n\n20\n00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.420\nSo, we're here to talk about risk and\nas the standards has demonstrated for us,\n\n21\n00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.400\nrisk is everywhere.\n\n22\n00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.080\nIt's all around us and\nnipping at our heels,\n\n23\n00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.355\nespecially when we're doing things live,\nright?\n\n24\n00:00:48.355 --> 00:00:51.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, when we're talking about risk we're\n\n25\n00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.920\ngoing to continue our conversation with\nregards to and handling risk We've defined\n\n26\n00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.560\nrisk for you in prior discussions,\nbut it's always important to revisit\n\n27\n00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.650\ndefinitions like this, understand them and\nmake sure we're comfortable with them.\n\n28\n00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.290\nRisk especially plays such a vital role,\n\n29\n00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.600\nsuch a central pivotal role in what we\ndo with regard to incident handling.\n\n30\n00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.320\nIf we're not able to understand, manage,\nand assess risk on a regular basis,\n\n31\n00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.890\nWe really have no way of understanding\nwhether we're on task, or on target, and\n\n32\n00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.360\nor in the right place doing the right\nthing in regards to incident handling.\n\n33\n00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.230\nSo, one person's risk\nin other words may or\n\n34\n00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.750\nmay not be perceived by\nother people the same way.\n\n35\n00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.310\nAnd, that is important for\nus to consider and think about.\n\n36\n00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.299\nSo, risk classic definition\nwe've often talked about.\n\n37\n00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.590\nMeasure the extent to which an entity\nis threatened by a potential\n\n38\n00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.410\ncircumstance or event.\n\n39\n00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.560\nIn other words, essentially it is\nreally the idea of understanding\n\n40\n00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.370\nwhat the potential negative\nconsequences are of activities, right?\n\n41\n00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:43.960\nThat's what we really talk about.\n\n42\n00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.330\nAnd, it's made up as I said in the prior\ndiscussion around the definition of two\n\n43\n00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.360\ndistinct things.\n\n44\n00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.610\nThe ability to understand the bad or\nnegative consequence that will occur,\n\n45\n00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.620\nif something goes wrong and\nhow likely it is that, that will happen.\n\n46\n00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.710\nSo, how likely it is that it's going\nto happen and much is it gonna hurt?\n\n47\n00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.170\nIs what we often talk about.\n\n48\n00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.227\nAnd, if we understand and fundamentally\nmanage, those two expectations.\n\n49\n00:02:05.227 --> 00:02:08.020\nIf we have knowledge of and\nawareness of those things,\n\n50\n00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.481\nwe can begin to talk about assess manage,\nand interact with it, and\n\n51\n00:02:11.481 --> 00:02:14.990\nof course hopefully learn how to minimize,\nor mitigate risk.\n\n52\n00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.880\nAnd that is part of what\nwe're here to talk about.\n\n53\n00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.860\nHow do we manage risk?\n\n54\n00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.670\nHow do we identify it, how do we know it?\n\n55\n00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.742\nAnd ultimately when it is there,\nit is something we are asked to address.\n\n56\n00:02:23.742 --> 00:02:27.543\nHow do we respond in kind with\nappropriate, and indeed hopefully,\n\n57\n00:02:27.543 --> 00:02:29.150\noverwhelming force?\n\n58\n00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.910\nBeat the tar and the snot out of risk,\nin other words, right.\n\n59\n00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.730\nAnd make sure that we\npummel it into submission.\n\n60\n00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.395\nBut nicely-\n&gt;&gt; Stack the deck in our favor.\n\n61\n00:02:36.395 --> 00:02:38.220\n&gt;&gt; Nicely, you always wanna say\nplease before you beat up risk.\n\n62\n00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.610\nIt's always important to do that, right?\n\n63\n00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.220\nAnd yes, stack the deck in our favor,\nStanley was saying, right?\n\n64\n00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.980\nCheating is not a bad thing when\nit comes to dealing with risk.\n\n65\n00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.850\nAnd what I mean by that is,\nall kidding aside, we wanna win.\n\n66\n00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:50.800\nI mean, think about this.\n\n67\n00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.120\nAs security professionals,\nas incident handlers,\n\n68\n00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.420\nas IT professionals, we wanna be better\nthan the people that are attacking us.\n\n69\n00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.900\nWe wanna be the ones,\nthat safeguard our network.\n\n70\n00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.640\nThere's nothing wrong with that.\n\n71\n00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.630\nAnd you should have that thought\nprocess in mind at all times.\n\n72\n00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:05.670\nWe want to come out on top.\n\n73\n00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.414\nWe want to win, but\nin order to do that, and\n\n74\n00:03:07.414 --> 00:03:09.987\nthis is the part that people\noften miss and don't understand.\n\n75\n00:03:09.987 --> 00:03:13.432\nAnd, I spend a lot of time talking\nabout with customers, with students,\n\n76\n00:03:13.432 --> 00:03:15.420\nwith clients all over the world.\n\n77\n00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.770\nYou've got to be willing\nto act like the attacker.\n\n78\n00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.160\nYou've got to be able to understand them.\n\n79\n00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.740\nYou've got to be in their mind.\n\n80\n00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.060\nAnd understand what it is\nthey're capable of doing.\n\n81\n00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.460\nAnd I wanna be clear,\nI wanna draw a very unequivocal and very,\n\n82\n00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.530\nvery clear line in the proverbial\nsand here of our conversation.\n\n83\n00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.900\nWe are not suggesting,\nnotice I made this we so\n\n84\n00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.510\nI'm looping you into this with me, right?\n\n85\n00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.380\nI'm sharing the risk with\nDaniel while we're talking.\n\n86\n00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.420\nWe are not suggesting I,\nto be clear and fair to gain,\n\n87\n00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.870\nthat we're not suggesting that\nyou should become a hacker, nor\n\n88\n00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.880\nam I suggesting that you should act like\none on the negative side of that fence.\n\n89\n00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.610\nBut, I am pointing out to you that in\norder to understand your adversary, and\n\n90\n00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.110\nknow what they're capable of,\n\n91\n00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.620\nallows you to be more successful at\ndefending against those actions.\n\n92\n00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.140\nYou must become essentially,\n\n93\n00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.520\nwhat you fight in the sense that you\nmust understand the knowledge necessary.\n\n94\n00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.610\nAnd, the capabilities and skills necessary\nto take on the activities that the bad\n\n95\n00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.200\nactor is looking to accomplish and\nessentially propagate against you.\n\n96\n00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.588\nBecause, if you understand those thing and\nyou can then counter them,\n\n97\n00:04:16.588 --> 00:04:20.429\nyou gonna be much more successful, much\nmore likely to be successful at creating\n\n98\n00:04:20.429 --> 00:04:24.120\nthe positive outcome that is some\nhandlers are being charged with creating.\n\n99\n00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.464\nEither proactively, hopefully anticipating\nand blocking or reactive after the fact\n\n100\n00:04:29.464 --> 00:04:34.700\nat same with the couple and those actions\ndissecting them or simply examining them.\n\n101\n00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.530\nAnd learning from them to prevent\nthem from happening again.\n\n102\n00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.590\nEither way, you have to become\nin the mind of the attacker.\n\n103\n00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.110\nSomebody to be feared, because you\nare an equal and you are an adversary that\n\n104\n00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.630\nunderstands how to react if provoked and\nthis is very important for\n\n105\n00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.100\nyou to understand with regards\nto instant management.\n\n106\n00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.500\nSo, when we think about risks, we think\nabout understanding the bad outcomes.\n\n107\n00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.200\nAnd the likelihood of those outcomes.\n\n108\n00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.870\nAnd that's important for us,\nat the beginning of our conversation.\n\n109\n00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.920\nWhen we plan for risk and understand,\nright, what risk is, we have to\n\n110\n00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.030\nthink about the fact that risk and change\nmanagement are two sides of the same coin.\n\n111\n00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.530\nYou don't often hear\npeople talk about this.\n\n112\n00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.250\nAnd unfortunately from my perspective,\nwe don't talk about it enough.\n\n113\n00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.310\nBut if you're gonna be\ngood at risk management,\n\n114\n00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.740\nyou've gotta be good at change management\nbecause the only way that you control risk\n\n115\n00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.930\nis by identifying the controlling\nopportunities for change.\n\n116\n00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.730\nManaging them, documenting them,\nstandardizing the approach to them.\n\n117\n00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:32.010\nAnd documenting them unequivocally and\nauthoritatively,\n\n118\n00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.070\nso that we understand what the impact\nof that change Will be, has been and\n\n119\n00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.390\nwill continue to be as it\nripples throughout our systems.\n\n120\n00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.050\nIf you're not gonna change management in\nother words, you're not going to be good\n\n121\n00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.100\nat risk management because you're gonna\nallow unregulated, unlooked for, and\n\n122\n00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.330\nunaccounted for change to occur and\nthat's how risk creeps into a business.\n\n123\n00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.430\nThe vulnerabilities are exposed\nbecause unregulated and\n\n124\n00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.760\nManaged change is allow to occur.\n\n125\n00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.590\nSo, change and risk management\nare two sides of the same coin.\n\n126\n00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.290\nAnd we need to understand that.\n\n127\n00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.420\nTo be good at risk management, you have\nto be good at change management, and\n\n128\n00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.470\nif you go to change management, you have\nto be good at risk identification and\n\n129\n00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:08.450\nrisk management.\n\n130\n00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.680\nRisk analysis, risk identification,\nrisk management, risk assessment,\n\n131\n00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.130\nall the things that go into that.\n\n132\n00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:15.790\nBecause, if you're not\ngood at understanding and\n\n133\n00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.590\nidentifying risk, how you can possibly\nunderstand the opportunities for\n\n134\n00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.940\nchange that will let you minimize risk.\n\n135\n00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.430\nAnd how to manage those and implement\nthem successfully in the business.\n\n136\n00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:30.127\nI mean, this is just essentially and\nvery clearly in my mind anyway, but\n\n137\n00:06:30.127 --> 00:06:35.671\nobviously not to everybody, very clearly\nthe opportunity, the next is to crossover\n\n138\n00:06:35.671 --> 00:06:40.907\npoint that we look for and the opportunity\nto deal with change and risk in such a way\n\n139\n00:06:40.907 --> 00:06:46.470\nthat we can turn unknown and negative into\nqualified quantified positive outcomes.\n\n140\n00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.886\nThis is the control of chaos that we\nlook for with regards the security and\n\n141\n00:06:49.886 --> 00:06:53.694\nincidence management, so understand and\nvalue the people that deal with change\n\n142\n00:06:53.694 --> 00:06:56.340\nmanagement and the business for\nwhat they are.\n\n143\n00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:01.040\nThey're helping you to deal with risk and\nIf you manage risk, understand and\n\n144\n00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.050\nvalue the people that manage change.\n\n145\n00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.460\nAnd vice versa,\nif you deal with change, understand and\n\n146\n00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.090\nvalue the people that manage risk.\n\n147\n00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:08.530\nBecause it's a partnership, and\n\n148\n00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.660\nit's a dynamic way of dealing\nwith the uncertainty and unknown.\n\n149\n00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:12.830\nIn our world, right.\n\n150\n00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.170\nSo, disaster recovery planning,\n\n151\n00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:18.230\nwhat we call DRP and\nbusiness continuity planning, BCP.\n\n152\n00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.750\nThese days,\n\n153\n00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:23.960\noften combined into a BCDR acronym just\ngenerically called BCDR these days.\n\n154\n00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.900\nI wanna,\nI often thought as a kid growing up.\n\n155\n00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.830\nAnd as I started out in this industry\nthat, the perfect job for me, I mean like\n\n156\n00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:34.719\nthe job, to this day I would love,\nIf somebody came and offered me this job.\n\n157\n00:07:34.719 --> 00:07:37.920\nI would chuck what I'm doing in a heart\nbeat this would be where I'm going.\n\n158\n00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.340\nI would retire doing this.\n\n159\n00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:42.100\nI always thought and I've never been\nproven right or wrong I dont know,\n\n160\n00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.990\nI have a sneaking suspicion\nthat this does exist.\n\n161\n00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:47.617\nI've always thought that there\nwas an office somewhere,\n\n162\n00:07:47.617 --> 00:07:51.098\nthat people sat around in a room, they\nthrew darts at a wall full of balloons,\n\n163\n00:07:51.098 --> 00:07:54.689\nand whatever popped out of the balloon was\nthe acronym or name of the thing that we\n\n164\n00:07:54.689 --> 00:07:57.877\nultimately decided to,\nespecially in the government and military.\n\n165\n00:07:57.877 --> 00:08:02.538\nI've somewhere in the Pentagon, there's an\noffice that does this just to come up with\n\n166\n00:08:02.538 --> 00:08:06.694\nnames for Essentially operations and stuff\nbecause they speak their own language.\n\n167\n00:08:06.694 --> 00:08:09.621\nI mean you've got some exposure\nto it on the government side,\n\n168\n00:08:09.621 --> 00:08:11.890\nI do a lot of work government and\nmilitary.\n\n169\n00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:14.440\nNot just in the US but\naround the world, and\n\n170\n00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.860\nI'm never at a loss for words typically.\n\n171\n00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.290\nI talk to some of these\npeople I do business with and\n\n172\n00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:23.380\nI don't speak their language,\nI mean I don't have a clue what it is.\n\n173\n00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.900\nAnd I thought the coolest job in\nthe world would be sit in the room,\n\n174\n00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:30.120\nthrow the darts at the ceiling or at the\nboard, or whatever room full of balloons.\n\n175\n00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.204\nPaper pops out, ECPW, okay,\nthat's what we're calling this, and\n\n176\n00:08:33.204 --> 00:08:34.481\nthat's what it's gonna be.\n\n177\n00:08:34.481 --> 00:08:37.805\nAnd that's seemingly random but\nI have a sense that's how it's done.\n\n178\n00:08:37.805 --> 00:08:41.737\n&gt;&gt; I think the culmination of that was and\nhere's our random assignment for\n\n179\n00:08:41.737 --> 00:08:43.762\nthe day and a movie random aside.\n\n180\n00:08:43.762 --> 00:08:45.750\n&gt;&gt; I love it when we\nintegrate movies with this.\n\n181\n00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:51.060\n&gt;&gt; It was Beverly Hills Cop 2 or\n3, I think it was 2.\n\n182\n00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:54.592\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Where Judge Reinhold his character had\n\n183\n00:08:54.592 --> 00:08:59.680\ncreated, and\nthey had this long egg on the JCC, ODGAJ.\n\n184\n00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.910\nAnd then he was the head\nof that department, and\n\n185\n00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:06.710\nit was just a whole joke built around the\nfact that they make this insane acronyms\n\n186\n00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:08.600\nfor all these government entities.\n\n187\n00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.700\n&gt;&gt; It's just, it's crazy,\nwe work in an industry, all of us,\n\n188\n00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.650\nright anybody who's fortunate\nenough to do what we do.\n\n189\n00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:17.300\nAnd it is something that I feel fortunate\nto be able to do everyday, not just to\n\n190\n00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.360\nteach and do the stuff I do, but I love\nIT, I love security, I love what I do.\n\n191\n00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.950\nAnd I've done it for such a long time\nbecause I'm so passionate about it and\n\n192\n00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:25.690\nwe're fortunate to do what we do.\n\n193\n00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:28.350\nBut we work in a business\nthat has a language unto\n\n194\n00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.816\nits own as many businesses do but I mean\nthe acronyms are constantly thrown at you.\n\n195\n00:09:31.816 --> 00:09:36.480\nBCDR used be BCDRP now\nit's BCDR I mean some\n\n196\n00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:41.010\nwicked genius sits in a room somewhere\nlike a Svengali that's manipulating all of\n\n197\n00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:45.345\nthis stuff because normal people, I got\nnews for you, they don't talk this way.\n\n198\n00:09:45.345 --> 00:09:50.215\nI talk to friends outside of\nmy environment that I work in,\n\n199\n00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:52.835\nI just talk to normal people that say,\nhey, what are you doing?\n\n200\n00:09:52.835 --> 00:09:56.820\nI'll take my kids to soccer, I'll sit on\nthe field with the other moms and dads and\n\n201\n00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.600\nyou all talk to people that I don't have\nany direct relationship within business.\n\n202\n00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.530\nAnd they're like what do you do,\n\n203\n00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:03.650\nand I tell them what I do and\nthey're like that's ridiculous,\n\n204\n00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:07.320\nhow could you possibly understand\nall that stuff it's, it's insane.\n\n205\n00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.160\n&gt;&gt; You just do.\n\n206\n00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.440\n&gt;&gt; But you have that, that's what it is,\nso anyway if well yeah,\n\n207\n00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.970\nif I had one dream job it would\nbe to understand how that works.\n\n208\n00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:17.700\nCuz when I worked for Microsoft I was\nconvinced there was an office somewhere at\n\n209\n00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:18.720\nMicrosoft that did this.\n\n210\n00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.013\nI could never find where it was, but I was\nalways convinced I was one step behind cuz\n\n211\n00:10:22.013 --> 00:10:24.419\nthey kept moving the office around so\nI could never find it.\n\n212\n00:10:24.419 --> 00:10:25.683\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I'm convinced that\n\n213\n00:10:25.683 --> 00:10:28.580\nthere's a group of people that\nthis is what they do for a living.\n\n214\n00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:32.310\nThey just make our lives more\ncolorful with their acronyms so BCDR,\n\n215\n00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:34.870\nbusiness continuity disaster recovery.\n\n216\n00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:39.030\nWhen we think about BCDR, disaster\nrecovery planning, business continuity\n\n217\n00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:42.760\nplanning, we have to think about the fact\nthat risk is linked to these activities.\n\n218\n00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.780\nAnd that risk is ever-present, clearly and\n\n219\n00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:49.820\nomnipotent in its tendril-like ability to\nbe able to get into everything, right?\n\n220\n00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:53.740\nIt's the octopus in the room instead\nof the 800 pound gorilla in the room.\n\n221\n00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:56.590\nAnd because of that, we have to\nunderstand that when we're planning for\n\n222\n00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.900\nbusiness continuity\nand/or disaster recovery.\n\n223\n00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.792\nAnd we have to understand how\nto engage and standardize and\n\n224\n00:11:01.792 --> 00:11:04.041\ndocument the steps\ninvolved in those plans.\n\n225\n00:11:04.041 --> 00:11:06.372\nWe have to take risk into account,\nif we're not managing risk,\n\n226\n00:11:06.372 --> 00:11:08.539\nwe're not gonna be successful\nat any of these activities.\n\n227\n00:11:08.539 --> 00:11:11.482\nAnd incident response is\na subset of these activities,\n\n228\n00:11:11.482 --> 00:11:13.620\nit's directly related to both of them.\n\n229\n00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.450\nAnd we must incorporate and\n\n230\n00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:18.674\nunderstand the managed risk as part of\nthe conversation around these steps.\n\n231\n00:11:18.674 --> 00:11:22.491\nTo that end, I know that we have in the\nshow notes we've given you two formulas\n\n232\n00:11:22.491 --> 00:11:26.222\nfor risk and how we define and understand\nrisk, wanna share them with you.\n\n233\n00:11:26.222 --> 00:11:30.014\nWe have risk equal to threat times\nvulnerability times consequences.\n\n234\n00:11:30.014 --> 00:11:32.267\nThis is how you often\nhear risk discussed or\n\n235\n00:11:32.267 --> 00:11:34.589\npeople will often talk\nabout risk this way.\n\n236\n00:11:34.589 --> 00:11:37.437\nThey'll say risk is made\nup of these three criteria,\n\n237\n00:11:37.437 --> 00:11:39.413\nthese three contributory factors.\n\n238\n00:11:39.413 --> 00:11:43.669\nThreats, whatever they may be,\nvulnerabilities, whatever they are, and\n\n239\n00:11:43.669 --> 00:11:45.180\nthe consequences of them.\n\n240\n00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.835\nAnd when we multiply them together\nwe get a sense of risk, well,\n\n241\n00:11:47.835 --> 00:11:49.910\nthis is not a real mathematical formula,\nright?\n\n242\n00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:52.680\nPeople tend to misunderstand that,\nyou can't say okay, so\n\n243\n00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.550\nrisk is gonna be the sum\ntotal of all the threats.\n\n244\n00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:59.010\nLet's put a number to that,\nthat's 2.2, and vulnerabilities,\n\n245\n00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:01.880\nthat's 1.7 to the second, and\nit's not like that, right?\n\n246\n00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.620\nI mean you can't just do the math,\n\n247\n00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:08.780\nwe're just trying to show you that\nrisk is a multifaceted, right?\n\n248\n00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:12.823\nComponentized thought process that we\nhave to break down and understand how to\n\n249\n00:12:12.823 --> 00:12:17.127\ninteract with, in order to truly get a\nsense of its impact, its worth, its value.\n\n250\n00:12:17.127 --> 00:12:21.268\nAnd its overall thought process around\nhow we manage it because when we\n\n251\n00:12:21.268 --> 00:12:23.946\nlook at risk and\nsay generically high level.\n\n252\n00:12:23.946 --> 00:12:26.923\nOkay it's the measurement of all the\nthings that potentially could go wrong and\n\n253\n00:12:26.923 --> 00:12:28.040\nhow badly they could hurt us.\n\n254\n00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:31.326\nWell, what does that mean, does that\nmean I got out of bed this morning and\n\n255\n00:12:31.326 --> 00:12:33.060\nI didn't have any coffee?\n\n256\n00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:35.350\nSo that's a negative and\nthat's a risk, it is,\n\n257\n00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:37.850\nright, I'm not going to be\nas sharp as I should be.\n\n258\n00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:40.960\nMay not be as engaging as I should be,\nright?\n\n259\n00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.950\nBut the reality is it may not be an\nimpactful risk, maybe it's not a big deal,\n\n260\n00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:46.570\nmaybe I don't work with people\nthat require me to be that way,\n\n261\n00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:50.180\nso not having coffee may or\nmay not matter.\n\n262\n00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.880\nBut are there big risks,\n\n263\n00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.010\nrisks we have to account for,\nthings we need to be aware of?\n\n264\n00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:57.990\nAbsolutely, understanding threat,\nunderstanding vulnerability,\n\n265\n00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:01.360\nunderstanding consequence,\nunderstanding potential weaknesses.\n\n266\n00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.048\nThe impact they're gonna have and\n\n267\n00:13:03.048 --> 00:13:07.250\nthe likelihood that they're gonna occur,\nmeasuring those things,\n\n268\n00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:10.430\nunderstanding them, somehow coming up\nwith a way to frame that conversation.\n\n269\n00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:13.420\nThat's important,\nthat's what the definition of risk equals.\n\n270\n00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:17.000\nAnother way of looking at risk, and\nagain, these formulas are relative,\n\n271\n00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.760\nthey're not mathematical,\nwe don't tend to put numbers to them.\n\n272\n00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:23.960\nThe big raging debate in our industry is\nokay, smart guy, you've got this formula,\n\n273\n00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.270\nhow do you actually do that, right?\n\n274\n00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:29.950\nI mean, you say risk is equal to threats\ntimes vulnerability times consequence,\n\n275\n00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:31.970\nbut can we really put numbers\nto all that and do we get-\n\n276\n00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:33.530\n&gt;&gt; And have a value to the threat?\n\n277\n00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:34.260\n&gt;&gt; Right, I mean, yeah.\n\n278\n00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:35.530\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, what is a pound of\n\n279\n00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:36.080\nthreat cost right?\n\n280\n00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.770\nI mean, that's the kind of the funny\nraging debate that people have\n\n281\n00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:40.970\nabout that, right?\n\n282\n00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:45.040\nBut the reality is, it's not meant to be\nthat, and that's what people miss, right?\n\n283\n00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:49.130\nThat's the subtlety of what we do,\nit's understanding that, yes,\n\n284\n00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:51.370\nit's a way of framing the conversation.\n\n285\n00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:53.550\nIt's a way of putting it into perspective,\nbut\n\n286\n00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:55.780\nit's not a way of distilling\nit down to a number.\n\n287\n00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:59.683\nRisk doesn't equal five right or\nc, doesn't equal five or c,\n\n288\n00:13:59.683 --> 00:14:01.710\nit's just not that simple.\n\n289\n00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:05.460\nIf it was, we would be much better at\ndealing with risk kind of in a lot less\n\n290\n00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:10.200\nvolatility and a lot less unsure\noutcomes that we address, right?\n\n291\n00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.002\nWe would be aware of everything and\neverything would work.\n\n292\n00:14:12.002 --> 00:14:14.513\nBut because we know that we\ncan't anticipate everything,\n\n293\n00:14:14.513 --> 00:14:18.076\nbecause we know we can't totally get rid\nof all risk, there's always residual risk\n\n294\n00:14:18.076 --> 00:14:20.909\nleft in a system somewhere,\nwhether we've identified it or not.\n\n295\n00:14:20.909 --> 00:14:24.901\nIt's not about the absolutes, it's\nabout the thought process that helps to\n\n296\n00:14:24.901 --> 00:14:29.142\nbreak risk down Into the fundamental or\nconstituent parts that allows us to better\n\n297\n00:14:29.142 --> 00:14:33.030\nunderstand it, and therefore,\nultimately figure out how to address it.\n\n298\n00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:37.810\nHopefully proactively, occasionally, maybe\nvery often we miss that opportunity and\n\n299\n00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:39.600\nas a result, maybe reactively.\n\n300\n00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.730\nBut whether it's proactive or\n\n301\n00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:45.450\nreactive if we don't show up at all,\nthat's the negative, right?\n\n302\n00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:48.930\nWe show up late, but we know what we're\ndealing with, I'd rather have that person\n\n303\n00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.640\nworking for me than the person\nthat just never gets it and\n\n304\n00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.980\ndoesn't get out of bed and\nshow up in the first place, right?\n\n305\n00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.350\nSo it's about whether it's reactive or\nproactive,\n\n306\n00:14:56.350 --> 00:15:00.280\nunderstanding the building blocks, the\nconstituent parts of what make risk up.\n\n307\n00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.680\nAnd that's what this definition or\n\n308\n00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:05.370\ntwo formulas to sets our visions\nof the world with regards to risk.\n\n309\n00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.722\nWe're trying to share with\nyou before Daniel jumps in,\n\n310\n00:15:07.722 --> 00:15:09.860\nhe was asking if he can\nkind of jump in right here.\n\n311\n00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:13.890\nGive me just one second just to recap\nthis right cuz it's so important,\n\n312\n00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:16.180\nso fundamental, so\ncentral to what we're talking about.\n\n313\n00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.868\nAnd also important if you're\nplanning on trying to certify and\n\n314\n00:15:18.868 --> 00:15:20.298\ntake the ECIH exam potentially.\n\n315\n00:15:20.298 --> 00:15:23.248\nYou gotta understand how to discuss\nrisk in these standardized ways cuz\n\n316\n00:15:23.248 --> 00:15:24.426\nyou may get asked about it and\n\n317\n00:15:24.426 --> 00:15:27.590\nyou're obviously going to have to\nreproduce that knowledge at some point.\n\n318\n00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:32.141\nSo risk can be thought of as either\nequaling threat times vulnerability times\n\n319\n00:15:32.141 --> 00:15:36.272\nconsequence, and/or also risk can\nalso be thought about as equaling\n\n320\n00:15:36.272 --> 00:15:39.930\nevents times probability of\noccurrence times consequence.\n\n321\n00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:42.920\nAnd there's a general theme there,\nconsequence is always mentioned,\n\n322\n00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.870\nprobability of occurrence,\nlikelihood is always mentioned.\n\n323\n00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:48.577\nEvents or exposure, and\nvulnerabilities and weaknesses,\n\n324\n00:15:48.577 --> 00:15:50.548\nthey're always there in some way, right?\n\n325\n00:15:50.548 --> 00:15:53.610\nSo understanding one, or\nboth of these though processes,\n\n326\n00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:54.967\nis very important for us.\n\n327\n00:15:54.967 --> 00:15:59.594\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, it seems that risk\nseems to be a very relative concept, or\n\n328\n00:15:59.594 --> 00:16:02.072\nabstraction Of your context, right?\n\n329\n00:16:02.072 --> 00:16:06.790\nA risk here in this context might\nnot be a risk in another context.\n\n330\n00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:09.067\nSo, you have to take out [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Incredible situational,\n\n331\n00:16:09.067 --> 00:16:12.395\nit's an incredible situational and\nit's an excellent observation to make.\n\n332\n00:16:12.395 --> 00:16:17.086\nBecause the context is really the key\nto find a criteria that helps us, and\n\n333\n00:16:17.086 --> 00:16:22.384\nsome handlers, and so the responders to\nthe professionals, IT administrators,\n\n334\n00:16:22.384 --> 00:16:27.020\nwhatever we maybe, helps us to focus\nin on the likelihood at the impact.\n\n335\n00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.870\nBecause a risk that is\nvery unlikely to occur but\n\n336\n00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:34.380\nhas the strong negative outcome is\nsomething we have to be aware of, right?\n\n337\n00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:38.740\nThe one's in a 100 year threat\njust happens once in 100 years and\n\n338\n00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:42.670\nif we're in business for 100 years, we're\nlikely to see that happen at some point.\n\n339\n00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:46.870\nBut if we're not, then the context to\nthat risk may not matter to us and\n\n340\n00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:47.930\nit may not be important.\n\n341\n00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:51.630\nBut risks that occur everyday, even though\nthey may not be very impactful, but\n\n342\n00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:55.470\nthe buildup of that impact over\ntime is gonna still hurt us,\n\n343\n00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:57.850\nis something that we may have\nto take even more seriously.\n\n344\n00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:01.330\nBecause although it's small and\nincremental, those changes and\n\n345\n00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.630\nthose damages over time lead to\nsignificant negative outcomes.\n\n346\n00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:06.382\nAnd so\ncontext is exactly what risk is all about.\n\n347\n00:17:06.382 --> 00:17:08.350\nIt's the lens, right?\n\n348\n00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:11.010\nOr, the framework that\nwe view risk through.\n\n349\n00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:14.920\nMy risk or one person's risk may or\nmay not be important to another person,\n\n350\n00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.020\nas Daniel so aptly suggested,\n\n351\n00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:20.470\nbecause the context may be very different,\nright, as we talked about.\n\n352\n00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:23.570\nIf you're not online dealing with web\nservices as part of your business,\n\n353\n00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:26.490\nyou could care a less about the moray\nweb bot and the fact that it took\n\n354\n00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:30.260\ndown DNS services at the end of\n2016 cuz it just didn't impact you.\n\n355\n00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.030\nI have customers who heard about that and\nsaid, well, that's horrible.\n\n356\n00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:35.891\nBut you know what, we just didn't\nhave exposure it sucks if we did.\n\n357\n00:17:35.891 --> 00:17:37.941\nAnd obviously if it did,\nit would have been an issue, but\n\n358\n00:17:37.941 --> 00:17:39.870\nthankfully it just didn't affect us.\n\n359\n00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:41.570\nWasn't a big deal.\n\n360\n00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:44.620\nConsequence is all about what\nwe deal with with risk, right?\n\n361\n00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.270\nSo it is that lens that we would bring\ninto focus or take out of focus.\n\n362\n00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:49.680\nThat's a good way of thinking about that,\nI like that a lot, actually.\n\n363\n00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.601\nYou should take the rest of the show off.\n\n364\n00:17:51.601 --> 00:17:53.220\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Take a load off.\n\n365\n00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:54.214\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to have a Coke and a smile.\n\n366\n00:17:54.214 --> 00:17:56.185\n&gt;&gt; You earned a break for\nthat one, that was a good one.\n\n367\n00:17:56.185 --> 00:17:57.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so risk policy, right?\n\n368\n00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.500\nHow do we deal with risk?\n\n369\n00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.840\nWe've talked about the concepts of risk,\n\n370\n00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.415\ntalked about the way in which we\nframe the definition of risk, but\n\n371\n00:18:04.415 --> 00:18:08.640\nwe need to have policy in order to frame\nthe dialogue from senior leadership,\n\n372\n00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:13.125\nsenior stakeholders in the businesses,\ndown to everybody else to give us answers\n\n373\n00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:16.838\nto two fundamentally important questions,\nwhy and what, right.\n\n374\n00:18:16.838 --> 00:18:18.800\nThis is really what policy addresses.\n\n375\n00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:23.020\nThe strategic imperative of the business\nis really addressed through policy.\n\n376\n00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:25.100\nAnd so business requirements are framed,\n\n377\n00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:30.110\ndialogue is engaged in, information\nis communicated in a high-level,\n\n378\n00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:33.500\nsignificant but strategic way\nfrom the perspective of policy.\n\n379\n00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.320\nPolicy is not tactical.\n\n380\n00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.190\nIt is not about go here,\ndo this and then expect this.\n\n381\n00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:42.660\nIt's strategic, it's about the high\nlevel conversation of why, route calls,\n\n382\n00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:43.840\nwhy we're doing this.\n\n383\n00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:46.300\nAnd what, what are we here to do,\nwhat are we here to accomplish.\n\n384\n00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.980\nLet's lay out the details in procedure and\nprocess, but\n\n385\n00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:53.870\nlet's create the high level statement\nof intent with regards to policy.\n\n386\n00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:56.630\nAnd policies should come from\nsenior leaders in the business,\n\n387\n00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:58.480\nwhether they're called stakeholders,\n\n388\n00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:02.520\nthey're called c-level executives,\nthey're called decision makers.\n\n389\n00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.080\nI hear them referred to by\nlots of different titles\n\n390\n00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:09.710\nwhen I talk with customers in the field,\nwhen I deal with businesses.\n\n391\n00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:12.620\nThere's a variety of titles ascribed,\nenrolled and\n\n392\n00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:18.380\nsubscribed to this thought process,\nright, the people that are making policy.\n\n393\n00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:21.560\nNot as important to know what to call\nthem, what's more important is to\n\n394\n00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:25.420\nunderstand that they are the thought\nleaders in the business that are giving\n\n395\n00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:30.790\nguidance and direction with regards to\nbusiness alignment, business requirement,\n\n396\n00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:34.240\nalignment with the business to be\nable to pursue those objectives.\n\n397\n00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.891\nAnd that's what policy should indicate.\n\n398\n00:19:35.891 --> 00:19:38.430\nNow we have lots of different\nkinds of policies, right?\n\n399\n00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:41.470\nYou got policies for\nusage of the Internet,\n\n400\n00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:44.230\nyou got policies for\nmobile device management.\n\n401\n00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:46.990\nWe got policies for\nhundreds of different occurences and\n\n402\n00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:50.240\nactivities, and all of them\nare equally important and valuable.\n\n403\n00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:53.170\nBut the policy that\nwe're talking about and\n\n404\n00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:56.290\nfocusing on here is a policy\nwith regards to risk.\n\n405\n00:19:56.290 --> 00:20:00.170\nAnd the risk management and\nrisk policy overall in the business\n\n406\n00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:03.620\nneeds to be clearly articulated and\nstated unequivocally.\n\n407\n00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.150\nAre we gonna be risk averse?\n\n408\n00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:06.760\nAre we going to be conservative?\n\n409\n00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:10.780\nIn other words, in our approach to risk\nare we going to be less conservative,\n\n410\n00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:13.272\na little bit more confrontational and\nout in front?\n\n411\n00:20:13.272 --> 00:20:17.050\nOr we're gonna be a little bit less likely\nto be conservative in regards to risk.\n\n412\n00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:18.840\nAre we gonna take more chances?\n\n413\n00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:21.170\nThese are things we have\nto think about and decide.\n\n414\n00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:24.340\nAnd the risk policy should frame\nthe dialogue around risk and\n\n415\n00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:28.670\nhelp set the tone for us in the business,\nand drive incident response and\n\n416\n00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:30.500\nincident handling as a result of that.\n\n417\n00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.691\nA set of ideas that ultimately\nare to be gathered up, discussed,\n\n418\n00:20:33.691 --> 00:20:36.601\nbroadly communicated,\nwildly accepted and understood.\n\n419\n00:20:36.601 --> 00:20:40.848\nAnd that drive the general thought\nprocess in the business around how we\n\n420\n00:20:40.848 --> 00:20:41.990\naddress risk.\n\n421\n00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:44.290\nThis is what a policy speaks to and\n\n422\n00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:47.540\nthe policy should definitely have certain\nelements and steps associated with it.\n\n423\n00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:48.440\nLet's talk about what they are.\n\n424\n00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.951\nThere's seven overall that we\nkind of clearly articulate or\n\n425\n00:20:50.951 --> 00:20:53.373\nidentify just wanna make sure\nwe're familiar with them.\n\n426\n00:20:53.373 --> 00:20:57.550\nThe policies should help us to establish\na context, as I was just discussing.\n\n427\n00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:01.530\nHelps to provide the answers\nto the questions why and what.\n\n428\n00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:04.754\nWhat's the context of\nthe risk we're gonna address?\n\n429\n00:21:04.754 --> 00:21:06.048\nWhy are we addressing these things?\n\n430\n00:21:06.048 --> 00:21:10.260\nWhat are the criteria in otherwards, that\nrisk evaluation and assessment should take\n\n431\n00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:13.790\nplace surrounding, establishing\nthe context as Daniel talked about.\n\n432\n00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:16.018\nIt's so fundamental, so\nimportant to what we do.\n\n433\n00:21:16.018 --> 00:21:19.041\nIf we don't context, we have no way\nof understanding whether we should be\n\n434\n00:21:19.041 --> 00:21:21.260\ndiscussing or\nindeed even acknowledging this risk.\n\n435\n00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:23.480\nI mean, it would may be important,\nbut it may not be.\n\n436\n00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:27.113\nMaybe we're spending time and money and\nresources in areas that really have\n\n437\n00:21:27.113 --> 00:21:30.812\nno impact on our business and as a result,\nwe really just shouldn't do that.\n\n438\n00:21:30.812 --> 00:21:33.942\nWe should move on and do something\nelse cuz we're misappropriating,\n\n439\n00:21:33.942 --> 00:21:36.860\nmisallocating resources and\nthat's a bad outcome, right?\n\n440\n00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.930\nThat's a risk in and of itself,\nbut a risk for a different reason.\n\n441\n00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:43.133\nA risk because we don't understand clearly\nwhat we should be doing as opposed\n\n442\n00:21:43.133 --> 00:21:44.921\nto what we are thinking\nwe should be doing.\n\n443\n00:21:44.921 --> 00:21:46.640\nAnd that's also very important.\n\n444\n00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.820\nSo establishing a context, very important.\n\n445\n00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:53.130\nRisk identification, the policy should\nup to identify risks, what are they?\n\n446\n00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:56.380\nWhat kind of risks that we\nare addressing are they web related?\n\n447\n00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.660\nAre they mobile device related?\n\n448\n00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:00.460\nAre they Internet related?\n\n449\n00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:02.353\nI said web already web twice it's so\ngood I mentioned it twice.\n\n450\n00:22:02.353 --> 00:22:05.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Are they Voice over IP related,\n\n451\n00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:10.750\nare they gonna be confidentiality or\nintegrity or availability related?\n\n452\n00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:13.960\nIn other words we have so\nmany different kinds of policies, and\n\n453\n00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:17.790\nwe have to think about the fact\nthat every policy addresses\n\n454\n00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:20.720\nthese kinds of concerns and\nrisks in a silo, right.\n\n455\n00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:24.050\nThe mobile device matter from\npolicy addresses risks and\n\n456\n00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:26.190\nconcerns about mobile device platforms.\n\n457\n00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:28.950\nThe proper and\nappropriate use of social media and\n\n458\n00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:32.940\nsocial networks in general should\naddress those risks and concerns.\n\n459\n00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:35.750\nBy the way if you don't have\nthose policies in your businesses\n\n460\n00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:38.740\ntoday definitely time to\nthink about getting one.\n\n461\n00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:43.470\nThink about the negative consequences and\npotential impact of misuse or\n\n462\n00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:48.050\nlack of proper guidance around appropriate\nuse on social media with regards for\n\n463\n00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:49.370\na company's image today.\n\n464\n00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:50.847\nAs crazy as that may sound, right?\n\n465\n00:22:50.847 --> 00:22:53.696\nThink about the crazy stuff\npeople do on social media and\n\n466\n00:22:53.696 --> 00:22:56.590\nthis gets people in trouble all the time,\nright.\n\n467\n00:22:56.590 --> 00:23:00.000\nAnd yet we don't, in many companies have\nclear guidance as to what that should or\n\n468\n00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:00.980\nshould not be.\n\n469\n00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:04.464\nI'm shocked, literally, I'm shocked\nall the time when I do auto work or\n\n470\n00:23:04.464 --> 00:23:07.229\nconsultancy work for customers and\nI ask about policies.\n\n471\n00:23:07.229 --> 00:23:09.340\nAnd, yeah,\nwe've got all the standard ones.\n\n472\n00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:13.001\nWe've got the Internet policy, got\nthe mobile device policy, remote access,\n\n473\n00:23:13.001 --> 00:23:16.550\nwe have password policy, all the biggies,\nright, all the standard ones.\n\n474\n00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:18.620\nAnd I say hey, great, that's all good,\nwhat about social media?\n\n475\n00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:19.960\nHow are you guys addressing that?\n\n476\n00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:23.600\nDo you have a policy about people\nbeing tagged in photographs wearing,\n\n477\n00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.320\njust go Daniel.\n\n478\n00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:25.980\nGo to shot for Daniel for\njust one minute for me,\n\n479\n00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.035\ncuz I'm not wearing my ITProTV shirt.\n\n480\n00:23:28.035 --> 00:23:29.002\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There you go,\n\n481\n00:23:29.002 --> 00:23:31.830\nright, so what we logo wear, where we\nactually, go back, go back, go back.\n\n482\n00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:33.710\nWait, we gotta do this right\ncuz I love doing this.\n\n483\n00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:34.960\nIt's the disembodied hand.\n\n484\n00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.582\n&gt;&gt; There it is, floating, so disturbing.\n\n485\n00:23:37.582 --> 00:23:38.940\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n486\n00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:43.490\nwhen we go to ITProTV we look at\nthat logoware, as we call it, right?\n\n487\n00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:44.477\nDo we have a policy for that?\n\n488\n00:23:44.477 --> 00:23:46.671\nMany companies will have\ntravel policies and\n\n489\n00:23:46.671 --> 00:23:50.140\nnot allow you to wear those shirts\nwhen you're on the road travelling.\n\n490\n00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:52.706\nAnd some may, right, some may say no,\nthat's good advertising,\n\n491\n00:23:52.706 --> 00:23:53.567\nwe want you to do that.\n\n492\n00:23:53.567 --> 00:23:57.578\nSome companies may have a policy that\nsays we can't take photographs and\n\n493\n00:23:57.578 --> 00:24:02.245\ntag you in a photograph wearing a company\nlogo, piece of log wear, because we don't\n\n494\n00:24:02.245 --> 00:24:07.020\nwant that potential negative outcome on\nsocial media reflecting on the business.\n\n495\n00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:10.150\nCompanies are waking up to this\nbecause this is a huge issue.\n\n496\n00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:12.830\nBut for\nyears this has kinda been under the radar.\n\n497\n00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:15.550\nCompanies has been dealing with\nit by not dealing with it.\n\n498\n00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:16.450\nAnd that's a risk.\n\n499\n00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:17.920\nThat's something we need to address.\n\n500\n00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.020\nSo risk identification very important.\n\n501\n00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:21.560\nRisk analysis, number three.\n\n502\n00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:22.720\nRisk analysis.\n\n503\n00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.060\nHow do we focus on determination of risk.\n\n504\n00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:30.810\nAnd how do we understand what\nrisk will be for identification.\n\n505\n00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:34.440\nAnd then how do we analyze risk and\nexamine it and understand whether or\n\n506\n00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:35.860\nnot the existing controls and\n\n507\n00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:40.170\ncountermeasures we already have in place\nare gonna be appropriate to the risk.\n\n508\n00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:43.530\nOr whether we have to plan for\nand implement new controls and\n\n509\n00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:44.480\ncountermeasures.\n\n510\n00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:48.490\nThat may step up our game so to speak,\nand give us a little more coverage, and\n\n511\n00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:51.640\npotentially minimize the liability\nassociated with the risk.\n\n512\n00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.680\nSo we have to be constantly churning and\nlooking at these risks\n\n513\n00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.610\nto understand whether we're\naddressing them appropriately or\n\n514\n00:24:57.610 --> 00:25:00.650\nwhether new risks are cropping up\nthat we may not have a plan for.\n\n515\n00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:03.800\nAnd if we don't, it's only a matter of\ntime before they come home to roost and\n\n516\n00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.150\nwe have to be prepared for them.\n\n517\n00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:06.860\nSo risk analysis very important.\n\n518\n00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:08.680\nWhat about risk evaluation.\n\n519\n00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.860\nThe ability to understand as we said\nthrough identification, analysis and\n\n520\n00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:12.750\nevaluation.\n\n521\n00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:15.770\nThis whole thought process\nof what the risk is and\n\n522\n00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:17.430\nif we're addressing it appropriately.\n\n523\n00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:20.450\nAnd is it an appropriate and\ncontextual risk now.\n\n524\n00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:22.440\nOr is it perhaps no longer a risk.\n\n525\n00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:25.920\nOr is it one that's just coming online\nthat we have not been aware of until now.\n\n526\n00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:29.200\nThis is something that can\nchange with business cycles and\n\n527\n00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:32.200\nwith just general events that\nare going on in the world.\n\n528\n00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:36.410\nSometimes at certain times of the year\nthere are tremendous risks from\n\n529\n00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:39.100\nweather related disruptions that don't\noccur during other times of the year,\n\n530\n00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:39.980\nfor instance.\n\n531\n00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:42.310\nAnd it's the kind of thing we have\nto think about and be aware of.\n\n532\n00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:44.020\nSo risk evaluation.\n\n533\n00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:45.540\nEstimating risk levels and\n\n534\n00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:48.950\ntheir impact at any given moment in\ntime is part of what we need to do.\n\n535\n00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:51.650\nOn treating the risk,\nhow do we actually address the risk and\n\n536\n00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:55.060\nhow do we try to minimize its impact and\naddress it head on.\n\n537\n00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:57.389\nKeeping in mind concepts like due care and\ndue diligence.\n\n538\n00:25:57.389 --> 00:26:01.575\nMaking sure we understand the impact\nwe can have with our actions.\n\n539\n00:26:01.575 --> 00:26:03.635\nAnd the oversight,\nthe governance risks, and\n\n540\n00:26:03.635 --> 00:26:07.405\ncompliance focus we need to bring to\nthe table as incidence responders.\n\n541\n00:26:07.405 --> 00:26:10.855\nI really think, certified incident\nhandler is a great thought process,\n\n542\n00:26:10.855 --> 00:26:14.800\ngreat certification, obviously for\nvaluable information.\n\n543\n00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:19.550\nBut I think it should be certified\ninformation handler slash appropriate,\n\n544\n00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:23.060\nor some way dealing with bringing\nin risk to that conversation,\n\n545\n00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:25.990\nnot just certified information,\ncertified incident handler.\n\n546\n00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:26.520\nBut also,\n\n547\n00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:30.970\nI think it should also be something along\nthe lines of end risk practitioner.\n\n548\n00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:34.030\nBecause if you're not dealing with\nrisk and being a risk manager,\n\n549\n00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:36.760\nyou really can't be good at what\nwe do as incident handlers In and\n\n550\n00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:38.780\nof itself because you're\njust not armed properly.\n\n551\n00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:41.880\nYou're not prepared, you're not trained,\nyou don't have the right tools.\n\n552\n00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:44.310\nAnd I think you have to bring\nrisk into that conversation, and\n\n553\n00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:47.800\nthe treatment of risk is really a very\nimportant part of incident handling.\n\n554\n00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:48.480\nAnd then-\n&gt;&gt; But that would\n\n555\n00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.555\nmake a comically long acronym.\n\n556\n00:26:49.555 --> 00:26:51.940\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's my whole point here.\n\n557\n00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:53.015\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying to push for-\n\n558\n00:26:53.015 --> 00:26:54.145\n&gt;&gt; Trying to weave that in there.\n\n559\n00:26:54.145 --> 00:26:57.145\n&gt;&gt; The creation of that job role that\nI'm looking to carve out for myself.\n\n560\n00:26:57.145 --> 00:26:59.075\nI wanna be able to kick back\non the desert island at some\n\n561\n00:26:59.075 --> 00:26:59.875\npoint-\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n562\n00:26:59.875 --> 00:27:00.635\nJust throw darts.\n\n563\n00:27:00.635 --> 00:27:03.180\n&gt;&gt; Just throw darts and say okay,\nthat's what we're calling it today.\n\n564\n00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.010\nChina just called up and\nsaid they need a new acronym.\n\n565\n00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:06.227\nLet's come up with one.\n&gt;&gt; Good to go [CROSSTALK].\n\n566\n00:27:06.227 --> 00:27:06.913\n&gt;&gt; Or India, or who knows where.\n\n567\n00:27:06.913 --> 00:27:09.099\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Could take orders from everywhere.\n\n568\n00:27:09.099 --> 00:27:12.270\nIt would be a great cool\nopportunity to do that.\n\n569\n00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:14.400\nSo treating risk, number five.\n\n570\n00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.610\nWhat about modern reviewing.\n\n571\n00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:16.360\nWe've talk about that,\n\n572\n00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:20.220\nthe ongoing oversight,\nthe ongoing compliance thought process.\n\n573\n00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.300\nAnd then communication and consultation.\n\n574\n00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:23.360\nEssentially reporting and\n\n575\n00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:27.120\njust documenting and clearly communicating\narticulating what we're talking about.\n\n576\n00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.690\nSo, when we talk about these things\nthat are building blocks and\n\n577\n00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:33.960\ncomponents of the policy, we really\nwanna make sure we understand the seven\n\n578\n00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.720\nkey areas that we need to focus on.\n\n579\n00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:40.510\nNot to say that every policy has to be\nbuilt to enumerate all these things.\n\n580\n00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:42.630\nBut rather,\nthat these are key touch points.\n\n581\n00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:46.910\nKey areas that we have to focus on\nspecifically with regards to risk\n\n582\n00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:51.780\nas we identify and contain and ultimately\ndocument and discuss risk in the business\n\n583\n00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:54.810\nBecause without knowledge of these things,\nit's almost impossible for\n\n584\n00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:58.220\nus to have and articulate and\nmeaningful conversation about risk.\n\n585\n00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:01.840\nAnd if we can't do that, we have no way\nof understanding how to address risk\n\n586\n00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.370\nin a way that really will\nlead to positive outcomes.\n\n587\n00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:07.345\nThis is the challenge, the negative that\nwe have to constantly be fighting against.\n\n588\n00:28:07.345 --> 00:28:10.020\nSo the seven areas that\nwe wanna focus on and\n\n589\n00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:14.766\nmake sure we're really thinking about and\nmaking sure we're comfortable\n\n590\n00:28:14.766 --> 00:28:19.255\nwith regards to the policy statements\nare important for you to keep in kind.\n\n591\n00:28:19.255 --> 00:28:20.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Build the contest,\n\n592\n00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:24.470\nestablishing your context,\nrisk identification, risk analysis,\n\n593\n00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:30.390\nrisk evaluation, risk treatment, monitor\nand review and ultimately communication.\n\n594\n00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:34.110\nAnd essentially broad and wide and\naudience-relevant and appropriate\n\n595\n00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:37.620\ncommunication is what we want to make sure\nwe're talking about and thinking about.\n\n596\n00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:41.182\nIf we're good with these then we have\na well thought out, well-structured,\n\n597\n00:28:41.182 --> 00:28:43.000\nwell-articulated policy.\n\n598\n00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.200\nCan we go to my machine for just a minute,\n\n599\n00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.700\nspeaking of policy I\nwanna show you something.\n\n600\n00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.700\nHey, look at that what\na cool little picture.\n\n601\n00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:52.060\nAll right, so you got me standing here and\n\n602\n00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:54.345\nthrough I always get this\nwrong through the beautiful.\n\n603\n00:28:54.345 --> 00:28:55.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Modern and\n\n604\n00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:58.350\nI gotta go this way now because I came in\npoint through the beautiful modern aspect\n\n605\n00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:59.970\nof technology look what\nwe have on the screen.\n\n606\n00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:02.281\nThat is such an unnatural thing for\nme to be doing.\n\n607\n00:29:02.281 --> 00:29:04.174\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; By the way to do that because I'm used\n\n608\n00:29:04.174 --> 00:29:04.695\nto doing this.\n\n609\n00:29:04.695 --> 00:29:06.022\n&gt;&gt; So funny.\n&gt;&gt; But I have to be over there.\n\n610\n00:29:06.022 --> 00:29:08.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then I have to go like this.\n\n611\n00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:09.350\nIt's just crazy.\n\n612\n00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:11.510\nAnyway let's talk about what\nwe're here to talk about.\n\n613\n00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:14.990\nSo I wanna show you just a couple of\nthings regards some resources on the web\n\n614\n00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:19.010\nand help us not just to address\nto deal with risk but broadly\n\n615\n00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:22.970\nhow to identify manage it but also I wanna\nshow you place we get policy template if\n\n616\n00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:26.472\nyou're not familiar with them and\nmay not know we're talking about policy.\n\n617\n00:29:26.472 --> 00:29:27.459\nHey we gotta write this thing.\n\n618\n00:29:27.459 --> 00:29:29.135\nIt's gotta have all these moving parts.\n\n619\n00:29:29.135 --> 00:29:30.770\nGotta have seven things.\n\n620\n00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:33.070\nAdam went on and on about this,\nit must be important.\n\n621\n00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:35.270\nHow the heck am I gonna build that policy.\n\n622\n00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:37.740\nAnd it may be hard if you've\nnever done this before and\n\n623\n00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:40.560\nare not familiar with it to\nunderstand how to write a policy.\n\n624\n00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:43.480\nI remember the first couple times I\nhad to do this for customers, and\n\n625\n00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.830\nthey said okay great Adam,\nwe need this, this and this.\n\n626\n00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:47.930\nAnd I'm thinking to myself okay great.\n\n627\n00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:49.580\nHow am I gonna do that.\n\n628\n00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:51.860\nI mean,\nnobody ever showed me how to do this.\n\n629\n00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:52.730\nI had to figure how to do it for\n\n630\n00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:57.490\nmyself and back in the day,\nwe're talking over 30 years ago now.\n\n631\n00:29:57.490 --> 00:30:01.180\nBefore all these great tools we had,\nlike Google, like the Internet,\n\n632\n00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:04.680\nlike the worldwide web where we didn't\njust share this information and\n\n633\n00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:08.520\nyou could go out and indeed find it\nfrom others that have blazed the trail,\n\n634\n00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.040\nit was a lot harder to figure\nout how to do this stuff.\n\n635\n00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:12.440\nAnd unfortunately,\n\n636\n00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:16.220\nI didn't have mentors in my life that\nshowed me how to do these things.\n\n637\n00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:19.960\nI had to figure that path out for\nmyself as I got into this field.\n\n638\n00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:24.865\nAnd as a result, I always promised myself\nwhen I figured this stuff out that if I\n\n639\n00:30:24.865 --> 00:30:28.245\never found myself in a situation where\nI was teaching or was able to share\n\n640\n00:30:28.245 --> 00:30:30.990\nthat knowledge I would never give it\nto anybody under any circumstance.\n\n641\n00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:32.165\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm only kidding.\n\n642\n00:30:32.165 --> 00:30:34.915\nI made a promise to myself\nthat I would share it.\n\n643\n00:30:34.915 --> 00:30:39.435\nThat I would spread that knowledge around\nto people that are coming up because\n\n644\n00:30:39.435 --> 00:30:41.675\nI remember the struggles I\nhad when I was starting out,\n\n645\n00:30:41.675 --> 00:30:43.360\ntrying to figure out how to get it right.\n\n646\n00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:46.340\nAnd always in the back of my mind\nthat little nagging voice was saying,\n\n647\n00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:47.700\nis this what the customer wants.\n\n648\n00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:48.610\nIs this the right thing.\n\n649\n00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:53.010\nIs this gonna help them or\nto just screw it up, to get it wrong.\n\n650\n00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:55.020\nAnd are they gonna be unhappy with that.\n\n651\n00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:58.460\nAnd you never wanna have that\nsituation where you give something\n\n652\n00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:01.755\nconfidently to a customer, they look\nat you and go, what are you thinking.\n\n653\n00:31:01.755 --> 00:31:03.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Did you not have that conversation.\n\n654\n00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:05.340\nWere you not there when\nwe talked about this.\n\n655\n00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:08.370\nThat's never a good conversation to have,\nso I get it.\n\n656\n00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:08.970\nI really do.\n\n657\n00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:12.500\nAnd if you're sitting up there, listening\nto this, and you're thinking to yourself,\n\n658\n00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:15.280\nI would love to figure out how to\ndo what you just described, but\n\n659\n00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:16.550\nI just don't know where to begin.\n\n660\n00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:18.310\nThis part of the conversation is for you.\n\n661\n00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:21.250\nThis is what we're going to do to help\nyou figure that out because there\n\n662\n00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:22.430\nare resources out there.\n\n663\n00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:24.230\nAnd there are places you\ncan go to figure this out.\n\n664\n00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:26.410\nWhat we're looking at first, so\nwe can go full screen just so\n\n665\n00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:28.100\nwe can make it a little bit easier for\neverybody to see.\n\n666\n00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:29.320\nLook at that, beautiful.\n\n667\n00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:33.770\nNow I could do this all day and\nnobody would see cuz now it's all good.\n\n668\n00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:37.930\nSo when we look at the machine screen\nthat's in front of you on the web,\n\n669\n00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:41.320\nand we're gonna have all these\nURL's in the show notes for you.\n\n670\n00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.120\nSo if you can't copy\nthem off the screen or\n\n671\n00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:45.210\nyou're just not quick enough\nto capture them, no worries.\n\n672\n00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:46.604\nYou could always pause and\ncertainly grab it.\n\n673\n00:31:46.604 --> 00:31:48.888\nBut we're gonna make sure you\nhave them in the show notes and\n\n674\n00:31:48.888 --> 00:31:50.449\nyou'll be able to go to these websites.\n\n675\n00:31:50.449 --> 00:31:53.260\nBig disclaimer, cuz you never know when\nyou're gonna listen to this stuff.\n\n676\n00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:57.176\nIf you're listening to it, two months,\nsix months, a year after we recorded,\n\n677\n00:31:57.176 --> 00:31:58.800\noccasionally websites do move.\n\n678\n00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:01.050\nThey do change URLs, do get updated.\n\n679\n00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:03.990\nJust understand we'll do our best\nto make sure they're accurate, but\n\n680\n00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:05.090\nuse common sense.\n\n681\n00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:08.140\nIf you go there, it's not what you\nexpect to see, hunt around a little bit.\n\n682\n00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:09.930\nI'm sure you'll be\nsuccessful at finding them.\n\n683\n00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:13.370\nJust because you never know,\nthe internet is a dynamic place and\n\n684\n00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:15.770\nit does,\nfrom time to time update and change.\n\n685\n00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:21.780\nAll right, so what we're looking at\nhere is the NIST, CSRC NIST.gov website.\n\n686\n00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:25.420\nComputer Security Division, Computer\nSecurity Resource Center specifically.\n\n687\n00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:28.080\nNIST's website is well\nknown in our industry.\n\n688\n00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:30.110\nHopefully a lot of you\nare familiar with it.\n\n689\n00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:33.490\nIf you're not, it's definitely something\nas a security professional you wanna\n\n690\n00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:34.710\nbecome familiar with.\n\n691\n00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:38.300\nAnd it is gonna be where we find\nthe special publication documents.\n\n692\n00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:41.930\nThe, what we call SP documents\nthat are going to be used.\n\n693\n00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:45.390\nAnd there's three categories, you can see\nthere that I wanna point out to you and\n\n694\n00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:49.160\njust make sure you're comfortable\nwith because these are going to,\n\n695\n00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.940\njust scroll over a little bit.\n\n696\n00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:51.640\nThere we go.\n\n697\n00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:56.560\nThese are going to help us to\nunderstand the different areas so\n\n698\n00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:59.600\nwe can look policy information\nup with regards to NIST.\n\n699\n00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.420\nYou'll see NIST SP800 Computer Security.\n\n700\n00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:03.806\nNow the interesting thing,\n\n701\n00:33:03.806 --> 00:33:06.990\nwe often reference SP800 as\nthe standard that we use, right?\n\n702\n00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:13.806\nFor computer security, and\nwe talk a lot about them.\n\n703\n00:33:13.806 --> 00:33:15.045\nNIST SP800 37R1, NIST SP800 39,\nNIST SP800 160, 161, 80, 81, etc.\n\n704\n00:33:15.045 --> 00:33:21.193\nAll these different ones.\n\n705\n00:33:21.193 --> 00:33:24.257\nAnd you'll hear me talk about some\nof them in upcoming conversations,\n\n706\n00:33:24.257 --> 00:33:25.185\nyou can look them up.\n\n707\n00:33:25.185 --> 00:33:30.095\nBut if you notice there, computer\nsecurity, December 1990 to present, right?\n\n708\n00:33:30.095 --> 00:33:32.055\nRight here.\n\n709\n00:33:32.055 --> 00:33:34.540\nThis is an ongoing development cycle.\n\n710\n00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:39.070\nIt's been going on now for over 20 years,\nright, and closer to 30 now.\n\n711\n00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:43.140\nAnd as a result, has a very long\nhistory and a lot of depth to it.\n\n712\n00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:46.920\nSo you wanna make sure you're aware of\nthat, and you can go look at this library\n\n713\n00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:50.095\ncatalog and search for all these different\nstandards that we're talking about.\n\n714\n00:33:50.095 --> 00:33:53.920\nNIST SP 800 cybersecurity,\n2015 to present.\n\n715\n00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:55.760\nOnly a few years at this point.\n\n716\n00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:58.540\nThis deals with an area we've been\ntalking about, cyber security.\n\n717\n00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:02.260\nAnd all the things associated,\nspecifically with things like cloud, and\n\n718\n00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:05.160\nvirtualization and stuff of that nature.\n\n719\n00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:10.209\nSP500, computer systems technology,\n1997 to present, right?\n\n720\n00:34:10.209 --> 00:34:12.230\nThis is a slightly, or 1977.\n\n721\n00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:13.423\nExcuse me for presence.\n\n722\n00:34:13.423 --> 00:34:15.700\nThis is the oldest of\nthe three categories.\n\n723\n00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:19.900\nThis deals with a lot of the foundational\npolicy documents that lay out\n\n724\n00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:21.590\nthe things that we take for granted today.\n\n725\n00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:22.860\nHow do computers talk?\n\n726\n00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:23.910\nWhat's a network?\n\n727\n00:34:23.910 --> 00:34:27.908\nWhat are protocols that we use and\nthe reasons why use them the way we do?\n\n728\n00:34:27.908 --> 00:34:29.960\nSo, this is a lot of\nthe foundational background,\n\n729\n00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:34.780\nkinda basement level knowledge that a lot\nof our discussions are built around.\n\n730\n00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:37.572\nSo you wanna make sure you have a chance\nto go out and take a look at this site.\n\n731\n00:34:37.572 --> 00:34:41.140\nIt's gonna provide you a lot of\ninteresting guidance for various things.\n\n732\n00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:43.700\nThere are several NIST documents specific\n\n733\n00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:46.530\nto incident handling that we do\nwanna make sure you're aware of.\n\n734\n00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:49.070\nAnd we'll take a look at some point,\nand actually, since we're here,\n\n735\n00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:51.479\nlet's just go real quick,\nto the NIST library catalog.\n\n736\n00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:53.420\nClick on that.\n\n737\n00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:57.460\nI wanted to show you real quick how to do\na search here just that you understand\n\n738\n00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:58.870\nwhat to look for.\n\n739\n00:34:58.870 --> 00:35:03.160\nAnd when you go out and you find or\ngo out and look up in this catalog,\n\n740\n00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:07.680\nyou're gonna find that you have a listing\nof all, in this case the SP800 areas,\n\n741\n00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:12.300\nare all the documents associated\nwith the SP800 catalog.\n\n742\n00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:16.992\nAnd then you can go ahead and\nyou can take a look and\n\n743\n00:35:16.992 --> 00:35:19.580\nthe NIST sites been having a little\nbit of problems coming up.\n\n744\n00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:20.450\nLet's try one more time!\n\n745\n00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:24.210\nIt's been a little finicky I\nunnoticed over the last day or so.\n\n746\n00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:25.390\nWe'll be trying to get to it.\n\n747\n00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:28.270\nSo sometimes, it just goes down for\na small period of time.\n\n748\n00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:30.470\nThe reality is,\nthey're always doing work on these things,\n\n749\n00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:31.330\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to the internet.\n\n750\n00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:32.720\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to the internet, absolutely.\n\n751\n00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:33.860\nSometimes, it's hard to get to.\n\n752\n00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:35.240\nLet's do it a different way.\n\n753\n00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.710\nLet's go back here real quick and\nlet's try this.\n\n754\n00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:40.430\nLet's just click here and\nsee if we can go directly there.\n\n755\n00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:43.780\nAnd sometimes that will just\nallow us to bring it up.\n\n756\n00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:45.010\nThere we go, right down there.\n\n757\n00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:47.220\nSometimes the catalog comes up,\nother times you just click on it,\n\n758\n00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:48.530\nyou can bring it up this way.\n\n759\n00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:51.400\nAnd so when you go down,\nwhat you'll find is, just scroll down and\n\n760\n00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:54.760\nwe have a listing, as you can see,\nof all the different documents here.\n\n761\n00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:58.610\nAnd the nice thing is that\nthey are gonna be listed.\n\n762\n00:35:58.610 --> 00:36:02.385\nThey're not chronological,\nyou'll see they jump around based on date.\n\n763\n00:36:02.385 --> 00:36:08.600\nSP 800-164 is October 2012, 163 is\nJanuary of 2015, that kind of thing.\n\n764\n00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:13.590\nBut they are listed by number, so the\nhigher the number, right, in these series.\n\n765\n00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:17.820\nTypically, the newer the standard but\nnot always because there are drafts and\n\n766\n00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:19.330\nthen there are updates.\n\n767\n00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:22.100\nBut one of the ones I wanna\n\n768\n00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:25.430\npoint out to you is NIST SP 800-161\nsupply chain risk management.\n\n769\n00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:28.403\nThis is one of the key things\n[INAUDIBLE] handing needs to look at but\n\n770\n00:36:28.403 --> 00:36:32.188\nit's often overlooked with regards to risk\nmanagement which is what's the impact\n\n771\n00:36:32.188 --> 00:36:35.240\nin the supply chain down stream and\nupstream with regards to risk.\n\n772\n00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:37.890\nSo we have to think about that and\nbe aware of that.\n\n773\n00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:41.800\nAnd that's one of the ones that we often\nlook at or at least are thinking about.\n\n774\n00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.725\nThere is also, just gonna scroll\ndown a little quickly here,\n\n775\n00:36:43.725 --> 00:36:44.809\nI don't wanna make anyone dizzy.\n\n776\n00:36:44.809 --> 00:36:50.230\nBut just come down here into the lower\narea, of the numerical sequence.\n\n777\n00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:51.240\nLet's just get down to there.\n\n778\n00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:56.159\nLet's go down a little further.\n\n779\n00:36:56.159 --> 00:36:59.790\nAnd there we are right there.\n\n780\n00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:04.483\nSo we can look at a bunch\nof different things but\n\n781\n00:37:04.483 --> 00:37:10.193\nNIST SP 861 Rev 2 right now which is the\nmost recent revision as of April of 2012.\n\n782\n00:37:10.193 --> 00:37:13.090\nYou'll see computer security and\nsome handling guide.\n\n783\n00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:16.410\nRight, and this is the NIST standard for\ninstant handling.\n\n784\n00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:19.290\nAnd when you click on\na document like this,\n\n785\n00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:21.170\nyou click on the link typically, right.\n\n786\n00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:23.370\nSo let's hold down the Shift key,\nbring up the PDF,\n\n787\n00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:25.920\nyou'll see it loads right up,\nreal easy to do.\n\n788\n00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:29.410\nAnd then you can go in and\nyou'll get through a document like this.\n\n789\n00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:34.630\nTake a look at it and read through\nthe guidance that comes from the NIST\n\n790\n00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:37.800\nfoundational elements of,\nin this case, incident handling.\n\n791\n00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:40.390\nNow, to put this in perspective\ncuz we have people that\n\n792\n00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:42.860\nare listening to this from\nall over the world, right.\n\n793\n00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:47.653\nNIST is a United States government entity,\nbut it is well respected worldwide.\n\n794\n00:37:47.653 --> 00:37:49.316\nIt is seen as being impartial and\n\n795\n00:37:49.316 --> 00:37:53.240\na thought leader in our community\nwith regards to guidance like this.\n\n796\n00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:54.240\nAnd it's well respected.\n\n797\n00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:57.040\nIt's right up there with ISO and\nISO standards.\n\n798\n00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:00.358\nAnd typically you'll often hear\npeople reference both NIST and\n\n799\n00:38:00.358 --> 00:38:03.501\nISO in the same breath when they\ntalk about these standards.\n\n800\n00:38:03.501 --> 00:38:10.180\nAnd so NIST SP 861 Rev 2 or R2, it's\nthe current standard for incidenthandling.\n\n801\n00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:13.260\nWith regards to risk and\nrisk management, ISO 31000,\n\n802\n00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:17.730\nthe ISO standard for risk management and\nrisk identification.\n\n803\n00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:21.950\nMaybe something to look at if you're\ninterested in examining and talking about\n\n804\n00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:26.060\nrisk and understanding it from the\nperspective of ISO and where that sits.\n\n805\n00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:28.370\nIt's one of the standards\nthat's very important.\n\n806\n00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:31.510\nWe also wanna think about\nsome of the other areas\n\n807\n00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:34.620\non the web that may be valuable,\nwe'll come back to these again in awhile.\n\n808\n00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:37.160\nBut just wanted to quickly\nshow you the C cert,\n\n809\n00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:41.600\nthe computer security instant response\nteam website, what it may look like,\n\n810\n00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:44.460\na typical C cert may\nlook something like this.\n\n811\n00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:48.690\nThis is one of the ones that's available,\njust at ccert.org.\n\n812\n00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:52.860\nYou may see the United States cert,\nthe computer emergency response team,\n\n813\n00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:56.560\nUS cert website under The Department\nof Homeland Security.\n\n814\n00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:00.060\nAnd this is another site that instant\nresponders will wanna take a look at, and\n\n815\n00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:00.980\ncertainly be aware of.\n\n816\n00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:03.218\nIt's something to be aware of and\n\n817\n00:39:03.218 --> 00:39:07.230\nto consider with regards not only to risk\nmanagement, but in some handling overall.\n\n818\n00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:08.740\nAnd vulnerability assessment,\n\n819\n00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:11.375\nand we'll talk more about this\nin upcoming conversations, but\n\n820\n00:39:11.375 --> 00:39:15.080\nwith regards to risk and risk management,\nhave to be aware of vulnerabilities.\n\n821\n00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:17.630\nAnd the cert area, or the cert site,\n\n822\n00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:21.090\noften maintains as many certs\ndo a vulnerability database.\n\n823\n00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:24.170\nIt's part of the US CERT under\nthe Homeland Security Office.\n\n824\n00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:26.350\nBut it's in partnership\nwith Carnegie-Mellon.\n\n825\n00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:28.455\nYou could see the Software\nEngineering Institute, the SEI.\n\n826\n00:39:28.455 --> 00:39:32.060\nAnd Carnegie-Mellon maintains\nthe Vulnerability Notes Database.\n\n827\n00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:34.300\nAnd you could see the most\nrecent vulnerabilities.\n\n828\n00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:37.190\nThere's one up there from\njust a few days ago, right?\n\n829\n00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:39.440\nAnd you could see that every\none of these is listed.\n\n830\n00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:42.333\nAnd you can drill down and get more\ninformation about it, read up on it,\n\n831\n00:39:42.333 --> 00:39:43.889\nunderstand what's going on with it.\n\n832\n00:39:43.889 --> 00:39:47.777\nAnybody using the huge satellite modems,\n[CROSSTALK] right, so\n\n833\n00:39:47.777 --> 00:39:50.446\nGotta think about that and\nbe aware of that.\n\n834\n00:39:50.446 --> 00:39:54.910\nThere's also the national vulnerability\ndatabase, just click there.\n\n835\n00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:58.390\nThis is maintained, again, through\nthe Department of Homeland Security.\n\n836\n00:39:58.390 --> 00:40:00.930\nBut also in partnership with\nthe US Cert through NIST.\n\n837\n00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:02.980\nThere's a couple of different\nways to get the information.\n\n838\n00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:06.008\nAnd then that's your\nvulnerability database.\n\n839\n00:40:06.008 --> 00:40:08.871\nThis is also gonna be a very important\ncomponent of what we talked about\n\n840\n00:40:08.871 --> 00:40:09.510\nand what we do.\n\n841\n00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:12.060\nAnd so\nall these sites are gonna be helpful for\n\n842\n00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:16.520\nus with regards to risk assessment,\nrisk management, risk analysis and\n\n843\n00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:21.335\ngeneral awareness because as an incident\nhandler, as a security professional.\n\n844\n00:40:21.335 --> 00:40:24.225\nIf we're not keeping up on\nwhat's going on, the latest\n\n845\n00:40:24.225 --> 00:40:28.605\nvulnerabilities being exposed, the latest\nissues and concerns in our industry and\n\n846\n00:40:28.605 --> 00:40:31.980\nacross multiple silos in our industry,\nit's very difficult for\n\n847\n00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:35.290\nus to be relevant to the companies\nthat we're servicing, right?\n\n848\n00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:36.810\nAnd I get asked all\nthe time by students and\n\n849\n00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:38.900\nby customers, hey,\nwhat do you read, what do you track?\n\n850\n00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:39.880\nWhat do you listen to?\n\n851\n00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:41.770\nHow do you know all this stuff, right?\n\n852\n00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:44.340\nI mean, I don't go to sleep\nat night through osmosis and\n\n853\n00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:45.398\nit bleeds into my head in some way.\n\n854\n00:40:45.398 --> 00:40:46.224\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That'd be great.\n\n855\n00:40:46.224 --> 00:40:48.400\n&gt;&gt; You have podcasts in your headphones,\nright?\n\n856\n00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.274\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can remember,\nsince you did movies.\n\n857\n00:40:50.274 --> 00:40:51.736\nYou remember Back to School,\n\n858\n00:40:51.736 --> 00:40:55.006\nI think if was Back to School\nwith Rodney Dangerfield, right?\n\n859\n00:40:55.006 --> 00:40:55.969\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n860\n00:40:55.969 --> 00:40:58.732\n&gt;&gt; And so you remember, at one point,\nhe's got the headphones on, and\n\n861\n00:40:58.732 --> 00:41:01.710\nhe's trying to learn everything to\nget ready for his exams, right?\n\n862\n00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:02.650\nIt doesn't work that way.\n\n863\n00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:03.560\nOr Johnny Mnemonic,\n\n864\n00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:06.830\nanother classic cinemagraphic\nmasterpiece with Keanu Reeves,\n\n865\n00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:09.730\nwhere you just plug the chip into your\nhead and expand your memory, right?\n\n866\n00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:11.030\nDoesn't work that way.\n\n867\n00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:14.150\nAnd so you gotta think about the fact\nthat as a security professional,\n\n868\n00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:18.240\nwe've gotta be out beating the bushes and\nreally understanding what all\n\n869\n00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.940\nthe resources are and taking advantage\nof them that are available to us.\n\n870\n00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:23.120\nAnd some of these sites\nare a selection of them.\n\n871\n00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:25.010\nThere are many more, obviously, right?\n\n872\n00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:28.960\nAnd there are by country,\ncerts in each country that you can go to,\n\n873\n00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:30.980\nyou can look at and you can be aware of.\n\n874\n00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:34.770\nAnd certainly there\nare gonna be the country or\n\n875\n00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:38.120\nlocalized versions of these\nvulnerability databases as well, right.\n\n876\n00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:40.800\nSo just keep that in mind and\nbe aware of that.\n\n877\n00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:49.120\nBut the reality is that as a result\nof that, as a result of that,\n\n878\n00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:53.830\nI think that it's important for us just to\nunderstand for you to understand, right.\n\n879\n00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:58.740\nThat we wanna make sure that you're at\nleast thinking about some of the relevant\n\n880\n00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:00.960\nresources that may be available to you,\n\n881\n00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:04.270\nand that you wanna make sure you\nunderstand how to access them.\n\n882\n00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:07.230\nBecause as I suggested when we\nstarted this part of the conversation,\n\n883\n00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:10.800\nif somebody would have taken the time\nto show me how to do all this stuff.\n\n884\n00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.700\nGranted, back in the age of\nthe dinosaurs where I started out,\n\n885\n00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:15.420\na lot of this stuff didn't exist.\n\n886\n00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:19.370\nBut the reality is that now that it does,\nup and coming security professionals,\n\n887\n00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:22.680\na lot of times you may not be aware of\nthese things and you may be doing stuff,\n\n888\n00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:25.820\ncertainly doing good work and doing\nhard work and doing everything right.\n\n889\n00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:29.020\nBut it would be so much easier if you\njust knew about these resources, right?\n\n890\n00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:32.140\nAnd so we wanna make sure that broadly and\nwidely available communicated to you and\n\n891\n00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:33.800\nthat you are able to\ntake advantage of that.\n\n892\n00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:37.530\nSo hopefully that makes sense, hopefully\nthat helps those of you out there looking\n\n893\n00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:41.080\nto do this and\nbecome certified in professionally.\n\n894\n00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:43.940\nThe more tools you put in your tool chest,\nthe more prepared you're gonna\n\n895\n00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:46.580\nbe over time to respond to any kind of\nincidents that you may come up against.\n\n896\n00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:50.180\n&gt;&gt; Well, Adam I'm sure our audiences\nare very thankful for your guidance and\n\n897\n00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:52.880\nwisdom to that, and\nwe surely do appreciate it.\n\n898\n00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:56.500\nAnd now it's forever enshrined in this\nlovely episode that we're creating today.\n\n899\n00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:59.410\nSpeaking of this episode though,\nwe are super out-of-time.\n\n900\n00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:04.500\nWe have totally blown our allotted spot,\nbut it was all for good reasons, right.\n\n901\n00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:08.240\nThat being said, we're gonna\ncontinue this conversation on risk.\n\n902\n00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.580\nWe have a lot more to talk about,\nrisk assessment.\n\n903\n00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:13.180\nThis is an in depth conversation,\nthat is for sure.\n\n904\n00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:16.060\nWe're looking forward to seeing you\nback here, Adam to continue that.\n\n905\n00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:18.040\nHopefully, you guys will join us as well.\n\n906\n00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:20.430\nBut that being said,\nit is time for us to sign off.\n\n907\n00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:22.990\nFor IT.PROTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n908\n00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:23.800\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n909\n00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:24.950\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next

00:00:12.195\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:16.990\nAll right, greetings everyone and welcome\nto another great episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.540\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we are back with more on our ECIH\n\n6\n00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:28.320\nseries, that's right the EC Council\nCertified Handler for those in the know.\n\n7\n00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.800\nThat is coming back in the studio\ntoday to help us with that endeavor,\n\n8\n00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.910\ncontinue our conversation on risk,\nour good friend Mr Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.570\nAdam welcome back good sir, how goes it?\n\n10\n00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.350\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, so those who are not\nin the know are they excluded,\n\n11\n00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.870\nis it a club thing?\n\n12\n00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.270\n&gt;&gt; It is, you have to be in the know\nto be a member of our club and\n\n13\n00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.510\ntalk about incident handling.\n\n14\n00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.610\n&gt;&gt; Just gotta keep that on the down low.\n\n15\n00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.730\n&gt;&gt; Do we give out membership cards?\n\n16\n00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.960\n&gt;&gt; There's meetings on Thursdays yeah.\n\n17\n00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.940\n&gt;&gt; With a handshake,\nwe use a secret handshake.\n\n18\n00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.560\nAnd a cool pair of socks\nthat goes with it.\n\n19\n00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.320\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n20\n00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.510\n&gt;&gt; All right anyway so let's get\ndown to some serious business and\n\n21\n00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.970\ntalk some more about incident handling.\n\n22\n00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.400\nSpecifically we're talking about risk and\nhow risk is so important, so\n\n23\n00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.820\nfundamental to what we do with regards to\nsecurity, regards to incident handling,\n\n24\n00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:07.790\nincident management.\n\n25\n00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.440\nMade the case for\nyou in our last conversation that risk and\n\n26\n00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.580\nchange, risk management,\nchange management, are joined at the hip,\n\n27\n00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.090\nessentially two sides of the same coin.\n\n28\n00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.350\nPartners in the conversation about\nhow we keep ourselves secure,\n\n29\n00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.180\nhow we respond to things that may go wrong\nand how we plan to deal with those things\n\n30\n00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.820\nto the best of our ability even though\nwe may not anticipate what they are.\n\n31\n00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.970\nHaving said that and having thought\nabout that and hopefully if you've\n\n32\n00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.310\nseen that conversation, gone through\nit with us, then you're able to\n\n33\n00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.900\njump right back in with where we're\ngonna pick up here with risk assessment.\n\n34\n00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.020\nIf you haven't, just a quick word for you,\nit may actually be valuable for you to go\n\n35\n00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.500\nback and take a look at that episode, go\nthrough that conversation with Daniel and\n\n36\n00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.560\nI before you listen to what to do in this.\n\n37\n00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.176\nOnly because a lot of the themes and\n\n38\n00:01:48.176 --> 00:01:52.083\nthe basic information that we're laying\ndown in this particular episode are gonna\n\n39\n00:01:52.083 --> 00:01:55.285\nbuild onto some of the stuff that\nwe talked about from the prior one.\n\n40\n00:01:55.285 --> 00:01:59.036\nAnd it may be helpful for you just to keep\nus and have a better understanding of\n\n41\n00:01:59.036 --> 00:02:02.560\nwhere we wind up in some things we're\ndiscussing as a result of that.\n\n42\n00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.750\nBut as always, encourage you to go back\nand listen to anything we've done and\n\n43\n00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.700\nreview it as often as necessary as we\ncontinue to add some more knowledge.\n\n44\n00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.191\nAnd what do we say,\npay that forward, as it were?\n\n45\n00:02:12.191 --> 00:02:12.796\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n46\n00:02:12.796 --> 00:02:16.129\ngive you some more information that'll\nhelp you to better understand how to be\n\n47\n00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.060\nultimately a successful incident handler.\n\n48\n00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.150\nAnd that's what we're here to talk about.\n\n49\n00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.530\nSo, let's talk about risk assessment.\n\n50\n00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.180\nRisk overall, as we have identified,\nis really the idea of understanding\n\n51\n00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.290\nthe potential liability, and the potential\nimpact of negative consequence.\n\n52\n00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.550\nHow likely is it to happen?\n\n53\n00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.590\nHow much is gonna hurt us when it does?\n\n54\n00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.340\nAnd then figuring out what we're\ngonna do to address that if and\n\n55\n00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.045\nindeed when it becomes necessary.\n\n56\n00:02:39.045 --> 00:02:42.320\n[INAUDIBLE] I'm gonna interrupt you for\na second, I know you're busy keeping track\n\n57\n00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.810\nof all sorts of stuff that we do when\nwe're doing one of these discissions.\n\n58\n00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.240\nBut I'm gonna ask for your input here for\njust a minute and you're always so\n\n59\n00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.000\nkind to provide it to me.\n\n60\n00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.910\nAnd to help us to better understand\nthe conversation at hand.\n\n61\n00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.541\nSo when we think about risk,\nwe think about risk assessment, right set\n\n62\n00:02:56.541 --> 00:03:01.270\nthe guidelines and procedures that help us\nbetter understand and interact with risk,\n\n63\n00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.040\nweigh the value of, and the impact of the\npotential liability associated with it.\n\n64\n00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.697\n[COUGH] From your perspective, given what\nyou have done and what you know about\n\n65\n00:03:08.697 --> 00:03:12.804\nrisk, are there certain things we should\nbe telling people that we're talking with,\n\n66\n00:03:12.804 --> 00:03:14.963\nthat we're having this conversation with?\n\n67\n00:03:14.963 --> 00:03:16.151\nWhat are some of the key things,\n\n68\n00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:19.720\nthe most important things we should think\nabout with regards to risk assessment?\n\n69\n00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.900\nIs there a methodology?\n\n70\n00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:21.610\nIs there a plan?\n\n71\n00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.340\nIs there a call to action if you will?\n\n72\n00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.620\nWhat do we want to tell?\n\n73\n00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.580\n&gt;&gt; Well if there's not one,\n\n74\n00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.540\nyou definitely need to get one cuz\nthat's a very important thing.\n\n75\n00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.880\nWe've kind of actually been discussing\nthat as per our previous episode.\n\n76\n00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.170\nBut yeah, there are certain\nthings that you should definitely\n\n77\n00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.630\nkeep your mind engaged in, right?\n\n78\n00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.590\nWhen we're specifically\ntalking about incidence and\n\n79\n00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.680\ntechnology insecurity, you have to\nthink of things like data collection.\n\n80\n00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.750\nYou have to think of things like integrity\nof the forensic evidence as it were.\n\n81\n00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.710\nWe talked about this at length when\nit came to the CHFI course ware.\n\n82\n00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.260\nIt was a very important factor\nthat we make sure that everything\n\n83\n00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.880\nis maintained in a proper way,\nfollow proper procedure and\n\n84\n00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.710\nall that because we don't\nwant to contaminate anything.\n\n85\n00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.690\nSo there is a risk of contamination,\ntherefore, we need to have\n\n86\n00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.790\na methodology set forth in front of us so\nthat we might not contaminate.\n\n87\n00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.190\nOr at least mitigate as much\nof that risk as possible.\n\n88\n00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.322\nAnd basically with every topic\nthat goes forward from there,\n\n89\n00:04:21.322 --> 00:04:26.170\nyou need to have some sort of risk\nassessment that goes on each one of those\n\n90\n00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.362\ntopics and\nthen that whole scenario as a whole.\n\n91\n00:04:29.362 --> 00:04:32.870\n&gt;&gt; Whole scenario as a whole, I'm going\nto quote you on that, I like that.\n\n92\n00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.410\nIt was so good you said it twice.\n\n93\n00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.820\nThe whole scenario as a whole.\n\n94\n00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.010\nI 100% agree with what Daniel was saying\nand the reason I asked him to chime in and\n\n95\n00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.450\nwork through this is, it's important not\nonly to hear it from one person but,\n\n96\n00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.160\nwhen you hear very similar thought\nprocesses from multiple people,\n\n97\n00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.830\nperhaps presented slightly differently but\nultimately to the same end.\n\n98\n00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.509\nHopefully it makes more sense for\nyou because your getting multiple\n\n99\n00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:57.665\nperspectives, but your hearing those\nperspectives wind up in the same place.\n\n100\n00:04:57.665 --> 00:05:01.980\nAnd ultimately at the end of that\nconversation, it helps you to,\n\n101\n00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.150\nin your mind, fixate on the things\nthat are key and important.\n\n102\n00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.750\nAnd you mentioned something that\nI think is drilling down on and\n\n103\n00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.510\nshowing a little bit more.\n\n104\n00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.900\nYou mention the plan, you mention\nthe thought process of forensically sound\n\n105\n00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.220\ninvestigative procedure, managing\nthe risk, documenting it, identifying it.\n\n106\n00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.860\nWhat better way to do\nthat then with a picture?\n\n107\n00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.190\nIf you would please, maestro, let's take a\nlook here on my machine for just a moment.\n\n108\n00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.950\nWhat we're going to see is one of the many\nways that we can document risk and\n\n109\n00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:30.860\nunderstand it.\n\n110\n00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.470\nYou've seen, and we'll go, there we go,\nwe'll go full-screen, I was going to say,\n\n111\n00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:34.400\nin just a minute.\n\n112\n00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.330\nYou'll see we have risk assessment\nmatrix in the Google search bar there,\n\n113\n00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.718\nvery simple set of\nsearch terms to look up.\n\n114\n00:05:40.718 --> 00:05:44.190\nI encourage you to do this on your\nown machine while we're talking or\n\n115\n00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.440\nput us on pause for a moment and\nthen just go out and take a look yourself.\n\n116\n00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.780\nAnd you'll find something very\nsimilar to what we're looking at here.\n\n117\n00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.340\nI went ahead and just used the image icon\nhere because we just want to see pictures\n\n118\n00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.690\nas opposed to all references.\n\n119\n00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.770\nSpecifically because I want to show you\none of the ways that we do risk assessment\n\n120\n00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.380\nand how we can graphically display\nthe output of this process and\n\n121\n00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.160\nwalk you through it.\n\n122\n00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.130\nI think it's a really important\nconcept for us to spend a moment on.\n\n123\n00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:11.710\nI'm gonna choose this little\nthree by three matrix here.\n\n124\n00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.930\nUsually it's one of the ones that comes\nup right near the top of the screen when\n\n125\n00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.750\nyou do the search so\nit's usually pretty simple to find.\n\n126\n00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.740\nLet's just click on it and\nbring it up in a little more detail here.\n\n127\n00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.740\nAnd you could see it right here,\npretty easy for us to take a look at,\n\n128\n00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.900\na little three by three matrix.\n\n129\n00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.070\nAnd by the way,\nthere are many derivatives,\n\n130\n00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.220\nmany different ways of\npotentially looking at this.\n\n131\n00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.940\nThis is not the only way you would see\na risk matrix or risk assessment matrix\n\n132\n00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:41.180\ndefined, but it's a very common way\nusing what are known as stoplight KPIs,\n\n133\n00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.480\nred, yellow, green, sometimes referred\nto as a rag, red, amber, green chart.\n\n134\n00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.140\nJust depends on how you have seen that,\nwhat the reference point is for you.\n\n135\n00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:55.020\nProject management centrics, security\ncentric, you hear this from different\n\n136\n00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.200\nperspectives and different visions\nof how we manage information.\n\n137\n00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.378\nBut essentially gets the same place,\nright?\n\n138\n00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:04.580\nThe idea is that you'll more often\nthan not see likelihood on one side,\n\n139\n00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.480\nsometimes likelihoods on the bottom,\n\n140\n00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.730\nconsequences on the upper left-hand\nmatrix, depends on how it's set up.\n\n141\n00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.250\nBut likelihood and consequence,\n\n142\n00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:16.610\nas we've been talking about, are the two\ncritical components we measure here.\n\n143\n00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.460\nAnd so sometimes likelihood is\nalso displayed as probability,\n\n144\n00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.780\nhow probable is it that\nsomething will happen?\n\n145\n00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.700\nHow likely is it that\nsomething will happen?\n\n146\n00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.310\nEssentially the same vocabulary more or\nless, right?\n\n147\n00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.120\nConsequences, typically consequences,\n\n148\n00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:34.720\nsometimes you see that as exposure,\nso again, the same thing roughly.\n\n149\n00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.990\nConsequences exposure, language may vary\na little bit, outcome is roughly aligned.\n\n150\n00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.847\nAnd what you'll find is, depending on how\nbig the matrix is, I like the three by\n\n151\n00:07:43.847 --> 00:07:48.410\nthree, only because it's very simple,\nit's easy, it's very simple to work with.\n\n152\n00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:50.018\nIt fills up the screen nicely, but\n\n153\n00:07:50.018 --> 00:07:52.691\nit's also easy to use from\nan explanatory perspective.\n\n154\n00:07:52.691 --> 00:07:54.605\nWhen you get into some\nof these larger ones,\n\n155\n00:07:54.605 --> 00:07:57.452\nit just gets a little complicated,\nas you were mentioning when we\n\n156\n00:07:57.452 --> 00:08:00.169\ntalked about this this morning\na little bit before we went on.\n\n157\n00:08:00.169 --> 00:08:02.946\nAnd that it can get a little unruly or\nunwieldy right?\n\n158\n00:08:02.946 --> 00:08:06.451\nIt may be hard to figure that out,\nbut this one's nice, it's compact,\n\n159\n00:08:06.451 --> 00:08:08.200\na little to easy to follow.\n\n160\n00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.220\nOne the likelihood scale on the left,\nlikely, unlikely,\n\n161\n00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:16.410\nhighly unlikely, top to bottom,\nconsequences bottom moving left to right.\n\n162\n00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:20.960\nSlightly harmful, harmful, extremely\nharmful, you can substitute in a variety\n\n163\n00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:26.820\nof declarative or explanatory items in\nthose boxes, low medium high, right\n\n164\n00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:31.300\nis the same thing essentially as slightly\nharmful, harmful, extremely harmful.\n\n165\n00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:35.210\nSo what's there is not as important\nas understanding the conceptual idea\n\n166\n00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:36.100\nbehind this.\n\n167\n00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.270\nBut how likely is it to happen and\n\n168\n00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:40.790\nif it does happen how much\nis it going to hurt us.\n\n169\n00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:45.070\nThose are the two defining criteria that\nwe've talked about with regards to risk,\n\n170\n00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:48.170\nand that's what we wanna see here,\nand what we wanna measure.\n\n171\n00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:52.612\nAnd so when we look at something\nthat's highly unlikely to happen, and\n\n172\n00:08:52.612 --> 00:08:55.574\nwe look at something\nthat is slightly harmful,\n\n173\n00:08:55.574 --> 00:09:00.846\nwe see the x,y axis kind of intersection\nand the crossover that find a cell, right?\n\n174\n00:09:00.846 --> 00:09:05.930\nAnd this is insignificant risk, it's green\nlover-left hand corner of the matrix.\n\n175\n00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:08.110\nSomething we should pay attention to,\nright?\n\n176\n00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:11.720\nIf nothing else is going on wanna\ntry to spend some resources and\n\n177\n00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.220\ntime to mitigate this.\n\n178\n00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:16.826\nBut in the grand scheme of things,\nmay not be as impactful and\n\n179\n00:09:16.826 --> 00:09:20.432\nas important as some of the risk\nthat shift out to the right and\n\n180\n00:09:20.432 --> 00:09:23.210\nup to the top of the diagram\nas we move through.\n\n181\n00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:25.274\nHighly unlikely to unlikely to likely, and\n\n182\n00:09:25.274 --> 00:09:28.790\nout from slightly harmful to\nharmful to extremely harmful.\n\n183\n00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:33.700\nAnd as we move up and over and\nwe wind up at very likely to happen right,\n\n184\n00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.040\nand the intersection of extremely harmful,\nand\n\n185\n00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:40.470\nvery likely to happen is extreme risk at\nthe upper right hand corner in red right?\n\n186\n00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:43.790\nThis is the category of risk\nthat must be front and center.\n\n187\n00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:48.660\nMust be always at the top of any list\nof prioritize remediation activities we\n\n188\n00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.920\nwould engage in or things we look\nto mitigate into somehow address.\n\n189\n00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.210\nThose are risks that are gonna\nhappen continuously,\n\n190\n00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:59.840\nand they're gonna be, when they happening\ninflicting significant damage or\n\n191\n00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:04.260\nsignificant loss of viability\nin the system, service, etc.\n\n192\n00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.670\nAnd we don't want them to happen\nanymore than absolutely necessary.\n\n193\n00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:11.592\nSo a very simple graphical representation\nof risk, but one that I find,\n\n194\n00:10:11.592 --> 00:10:15.578\nregardless of where I am in the world,\nregardless of who I'm talking to,\n\n195\n00:10:15.578 --> 00:10:17.471\nregardless of any of the factors.\n\n196\n00:10:17.471 --> 00:10:21.470\nOr to use the words that Daniel used in\none of our prior episodes, the context of\n\n197\n00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:26.160\nthe risk, which Daniel went out of his way\nto explain to us, is incredibly important.\n\n198\n00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:31.069\nAs we think about risk and the value of\nit, the context irrespective of what it\n\n199\n00:10:31.069 --> 00:10:35.007\nis, this simple diagram just works,\npeople get it, right?\n\n200\n00:10:35.007 --> 00:10:38.896\nI mean the colors for the most part, are\nuniversal, everybody understands that red\n\n201\n00:10:38.896 --> 00:10:43.220\nis typically bad, green is usually okay,\nyellow is marginal between the two, right?\n\n202\n00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:46.990\nPeople can follow the simplistic but\neasily understood and\n\n203\n00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:50.430\neasily identified framing of\nlikelihood in consequence here.\n\n204\n00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:54.470\nAnd it's a pretty straightforward\nconversation as a way\n\n205\n00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:57.480\nto share the thought process and\nalso the liability and\n\n206\n00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.230\nthe burden of understanding\nhow to assess risk.\n\n207\n00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:02.300\nWhen we think about\nthe sets of guidelines and\n\n208\n00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:06.630\nprocedures that help us to identify and\nassess risk, using something like this\n\n209\n00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:10.960\nis really gonna be valuable because\nremember, people learn In different ways.\n\n210\n00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.530\nThey're auditory learners,\npeople that listen and\n\n211\n00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:15.500\nas a result of that\nare able to understand.\n\n212\n00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:19.630\nThere's kinesthetic learners, people that\ntouch, that have to interact and do.\n\n213\n00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:22.410\nThere are visual learners,\npeople that look at things,\n\n214\n00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:24.890\nsomething like this and understand it.\n\n215\n00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:28.090\nAnd what we don't often realize and think\nabout is that people don't tend to be just\n\n216\n00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:32.185\none kind of learner, they tend to\nbe blended or hybrid learners.\n\n217\n00:11:32.185 --> 00:11:36.800\nAnd we tend to see the people that\nreinforce knowledge and create context\n\n218\n00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:41.110\nfrom a variety of stimuli and sources,\ntend to remember more and learn in\n\n219\n00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:45.380\na deeper and, therefore, more functional\nway than if they just go with one.\n\n220\n00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:48.750\nAnd as a result, it's usually good to talk\nabout stuff, but also talk about it with\n\n221\n00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:52.920\nregards to seeing it and then, indeed,\nactually accessing it and doing it.\n\n222\n00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.410\nRemember, the goal here of risk assessment\nis to identify and measure the risk\n\n223\n00:11:56.410 --> 00:12:00.880\nultimately, throw it into a bucket\ncategory and then understand its impact,\n\n224\n00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.610\nbut, and this is something people don't\noften think about, is risk a static or\n\n225\n00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:06.230\na dynamic thought process?\n\n226\n00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:07.650\n&gt;&gt; It's gotta be a dynamic one.\n\n227\n00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:08.690\n&gt;&gt; Gotta be dynamic, right?\n\n228\n00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:09.940\nAnd so, as a result,\n\n229\n00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:14.270\nif we think about this, is a risk that\nmay be highly unlikely to occur and\n\n230\n00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:18.050\nslightly harmful, and therefore\ncategorized, and rightly so right now,\n\n231\n00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:21.390\nas insignificant, is it always going to\nstay there, is it always going to be that?\n\n232\n00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:25.680\nCould it move up and out and\nperhaps dynamically adjust, given context,\n\n233\n00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.510\ncircumstance, and variables?\n\n234\n00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:30.680\nAbsolutely, no doubt about it,\nbusiness cycles,\n\n235\n00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:34.000\nweather, all sorts of different\nthings can affect that.\n\n236\n00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.880\nI just heard over the last 24\nhours that the northeast is\n\n237\n00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.340\ngoing to go through a major warming and\nthen a major cooling trend again.\n\n238\n00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:45.230\nSomething strange like a 30 to 40 degree\nswing, in the next 24 to 48 hours.\n\n239\n00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:48.630\nYeah, that's gonna lead to all\nsorts of problems with weather.\n\n240\n00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:51.750\nYou're gonna have snow melting, and\nyou're gonna then have potential flooding,\n\n241\n00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:54.750\nit's gonna refreeze as it gets much\ncolder, you're gonna have ice and\n\n242\n00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:55.510\nall sorts of stuff.\n\n243\n00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:59.090\nAnd that kinda stuff can lead\nto unforseen risk and or\n\n244\n00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:04.070\npotentially unanticipated activities\nthat may lead to risky behavior.\n\n245\n00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:07.100\nAnd these are the kind of things we have\nto think about as incident handlers.\n\n246\n00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:10.860\nThe concept of risk being dynamic is so\ncritical to what we do right?\n\n247\n00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:13.900\nBecause if we don't understand\nthe risk is dynamic, and\n\n248\n00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:18.730\nwe categorize a risk in someway as\npotentially let's say being a low risk.\n\n249\n00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:22.870\nBecause it may be harmful but it's highly\nunlikely to occur and then all of a sudden\n\n250\n00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:28.400\ncircumstances change and that risk gets\nbumped up into a medium or even high risk.\n\n251\n00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:32.530\nThen that's really something that we would\nmiss as a warning sign and literally could\n\n252\n00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:36.000\nbe on the wrong side of that conversation,\nso we do need to understand that.\n\n253\n00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.550\nAlso, we need to be able to train people\nto be able to use a tool like this.\n\n254\n00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:41.510\nIt's a fairly simple tool,\nit's relatively straightforward,\n\n255\n00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:45.770\nfive minutes of a conversation,\nand a quick understand of how to\n\n256\n00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:49.690\nuse this tool would probably be enough for\nthe average individual to understand it.\n\n257\n00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:52.614\nBut if we don't take that time,\nif we don't do the training,\n\n258\n00:13:52.614 --> 00:13:54.753\nwe don't spread the awareness, we don't,\n\n259\n00:13:54.753 --> 00:13:58.611\nessentially preach the gospel around\nsecurity awareness and risk management.\n\n260\n00:13:58.611 --> 00:14:01.703\nAs a result, incident handling to\nthe masses in the organization,\n\n261\n00:14:01.703 --> 00:14:04.633\nwe're gonna be walking around\nwith a bunch of people that don't\n\n262\n00:14:04.633 --> 00:14:08.430\nunderstand unfortunately how to become\npart of that early warning system.\n\n263\n00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.580\nI like the conceptual\nidea of see something,\n\n264\n00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:14.470\nsay something, as a methodology and\na thought process.\n\n265\n00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:19.000\nAnd, when we think about the fact that\nthe eyes and ears of the organization\n\n266\n00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.130\nare the average people, just\nthe information workers on the frontlines\n\n267\n00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:26.120\nevery day that we're going to be out\nthere interacting with our systems.\n\n268\n00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.900\nIt's highly unlikely that most of\nus as security professionals and\n\n269\n00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.990\nincident handlers are going to\nbe able to see every risk and\n\n270\n00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:34.790\nunderstand every activity\nthat leads to risk firsthand.\n\n271\n00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:37.090\nAs a matter of fact, I can guarantee\nyou this is not going to happen.\n\n272\n00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:41.180\nThat's why we automate system monitoring,\nthat's why we have continuous monitoring,\n\n273\n00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:44.400\nand all sorts of other tools and\ntechniques that we use today.\n\n274\n00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.040\nBecause systems are just too complex.\n\n275\n00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:51.990\nLet's be honest, there's way too much\ngoing on and as a result, unfortunately,\n\n276\n00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:55.690\nno real good way to bring focus to bear\nfrom a human perspective on everything.\n\n277\n00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:59.850\nSo if we're not incorporating and\nengaging all the eyes and\n\n278\n00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:04.340\nears of the organization in meaningful and\nforthright activities that help us to be\n\n279\n00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:07.470\nbetter armed, And\nbetter prepared by early warning.\n\n280\n00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:10.550\nIt's very difficult for us to be able\nto do this and do this affectively.\n\n281\n00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:14.260\nAnd we're successful at this kinda\ncampaigns because everybody understands\n\n282\n00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.990\nthat when they see something unusual,\nthey have to report it to whatever, or\n\n283\n00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:22.330\nthrough whatever mechanism or to whatever\ncircumstance that may present itself.\n\n284\n00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.700\nThey have to report it to\nthe appropriate authorities.\n\n285\n00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:27.350\nSo again think about what\nyou do in your world, right?\n\n286\n00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:33.860\nIf you today, in your organization don't\nhave a say something policy in place.\n\n287\n00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.527\nHow much more effective could\nyou be in instant handling and\n\n288\n00:15:36.527 --> 00:15:39.195\ninstant response if you\nimplemented something like that,\n\n289\n00:15:39.195 --> 00:15:42.630\nand I don't know is it a small percentage\npoint gain, is it a massive shift?\n\n290\n00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:47.017\nIn resource, actually resources being\napplied to problems and as a result,\n\n291\n00:15:47.017 --> 00:15:49.795\nactual results coming back,\nit's hard to say.\n\n292\n00:15:49.795 --> 00:15:51.716\n&gt;&gt; You could use your risk\nmetrics chart to figure that out.\n\n293\n00:15:51.716 --> 00:15:53.091\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We may be able to.\n\n294\n00:15:53.091 --> 00:15:54.523\nWe could adjust it for that.\n\n295\n00:15:54.523 --> 00:15:57.852\nBut more importantly, I'm willing to\nbet you and I will go on record and\n\n296\n00:15:57.852 --> 00:16:00.570\nsay this to you right now,\nthat I'm willing to bet you that\n\n297\n00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:04.398\nif you did implement a see something say\nsomething policy, just as one example and\n\n298\n00:16:04.398 --> 00:16:06.370\nthere are many examples like this.\n\n299\n00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:10.110\nBut if you implemented one, I'm willing\nto bet you right here, right now,\n\n300\n00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:15.790\nthat you will see a shift and an uptick\nin your preparedness and a downtick\n\n301\n00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:21.080\nin activities that lead to compromise\ngoing unchallenged and under reported.\n\n302\n00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:25.500\nAnd if I'm wrong, I'm willing to put\nmoney on the line and have you email me.\n\n303\n00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.650\nAnd I will give you a dollar for\nevery incident you find.\n\n304\n00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:30.704\nMy email is daniel_lowry-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n305\n00:16:30.704 --> 00:16:32.450\n&gt;&gt; @itpro.tv.\n\n306\n00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.070\nService guarantee from Mr. Lowrie.\n\n307\n00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:34.644\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n308\n00:16:34.644 --> 00:16:37.697\n&gt;&gt; I am kidding about that part,\nthere is no money back guarantee on that.\n\n309\n00:16:37.697 --> 00:16:41.581\nBut having said that, I am willing to bet\nyou, and I'm being serious about this,\n\n310\n00:16:41.581 --> 00:16:45.151\nthat I think because I've seen this\ntime and again over many, many years.\n\n311\n00:16:45.151 --> 00:16:48.779\nThat companies that go down this road and\nimplement the kind of\n\n312\n00:16:48.779 --> 00:16:53.249\nsituational awareness that we're\ntalking about definitely see a downtick\n\n313\n00:16:53.249 --> 00:16:57.610\nin unreported and unchallenged\nactivity that leads to compromise.\n\n314\n00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:00.810\nI'm not suggesting that means your are\ngoing to stop have break ins and issues,\n\n315\n00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:04.310\nwhat I'm suggesting is to be clear that\nwhen those things occur you are going to\n\n316\n00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:09.330\nbe aware of them sooner and more able to\nrespond and minimize their impact, just so\n\n317\n00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:12.290\nwe understand and are on the same page.\n\n318\n00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:14.360\nBecause I think it is important\nto put that out there,\n\n319\n00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:17.730\nthis is one of those simple\nthings that we can do.\n\n320\n00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:20.230\nBut that is so impactful for\nwhat we talk about and\n\n321\n00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:23.380\nhow we remediate and\ncreate situational awareness.\n\n322\n00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:25.810\nAnd we call it situational\nawareness in many areas.\n\n323\n00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:29.230\nBut the ability for people to\nunderstand that something's unusual and\n\n324\n00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:31.650\ntherefore bring to bear focus and\n\n325\n00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:36.380\nintent around that unusualness by\nbringing it to the attention of others,\n\n326\n00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:40.170\nis such a critical thing that it\nshould not be underrepresented,\n\n327\n00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:43.540\nin terms of the importance it creates for\nus with regards to risk assessment.\n\n328\n00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:45.020\nSo, this is one of the tools you can use.\n\n329\n00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:47.460\nIt's not the only one but\nit's a very valuable one.\n\n330\n00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.620\nYou may have a derivative of this,\n\n331\n00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.660\nyou may have something different,\nyou may see this differently.\n\n332\n00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:55.440\nAnd if we go back and take a look at some\nof the other charts that just represent\n\n333\n00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:59.980\nthis and we just take a look here for one\nsecond at some of the different ways you\n\n334\n00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:04.030\ncan see this, and just see the examples\nwithout clicking down through all of them.\n\n335\n00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:07.380\nYou can see there's larger matrices\nhere with different colors.\n\n336\n00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:10.410\nYellow is also gonna have an orange\ncomponent it cuz maybe there's\n\n337\n00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:14.230\ngradations of caution and\nwe have different activity thresholds and\n\n338\n00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:17.930\ndifferent levels of commitment\nto resources as a result.\n\n339\n00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.420\nWe could see lots of different\nways to represent this.\n\n340\n00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:22.170\nThere's some that deal with numbers,\n\n341\n00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:27.045\nthere's some that are just open to\ninterpretation, there's high, medium, low,\n\n342\n00:18:27.045 --> 00:18:31.875\nscale down accordingly over there as\nopposed to simply just doing the color.\n\n343\n00:18:31.875 --> 00:18:34.935\nThere's lots of different ways to\ndo this so there's no right or\n\n344\n00:18:34.935 --> 00:18:38.475\nwrong but what's wrong is not\ndoing this in the first place.\n\n345\n00:18:38.475 --> 00:18:41.985\nWhat's right is figuring out how\nto take this and localize it for\n\n346\n00:18:41.985 --> 00:18:46.290\nwhat you're needs are and\nmake it appropriate for your organization.\n\n347\n00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:50.950\nI often have the conversation with people\nabout the concept of one size fits one,\n\n348\n00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:52.370\nnot one size fits all.\n\n349\n00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:54.260\nAnd when we talk about security and\n\n350\n00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:58.060\nwe talk about the thought processes\nof incident handling, risk abatement,\n\n351\n00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:01.465\nrisk assessment, risk management,\nrisk identification,\n\n352\n00:19:01.465 --> 00:19:06.565\nbusiness impact analysis, disaster and\ncontinuity planning, so BCDR,\n\n353\n00:19:06.565 --> 00:19:11.265\nall these things are lumped into the same\ngeneral thought process around risk.\n\n354\n00:19:11.265 --> 00:19:16.070\nWhen we talk about these activities,\n100% guarantee and rely on and\n\n355\n00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:19.095\nwill stand behind the statement\nthat there are definitive right and\n\n356\n00:19:19.095 --> 00:19:22.490\nwrong methodologies you can follow\nin these areas, no doubt about it.\n\n357\n00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:27.060\nThere is and are methodologies for change\nmanagement, for risk assessment, for\n\n358\n00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:31.460\nthings like that that are time-tested and\nproven to work well.\n\n359\n00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:35.540\nI'm not suggesting that you shouldn't\ngo with a standardized approach.\n\n360\n00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:36.910\nBut what I am suggesting is,\n\n361\n00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:40.740\nthat you should also not be afraid to take\nthat standardized approach off the shelf.\n\n362\n00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:44.950\nAnd customize it to the unique\nvariables that exist in your world and\n\n363\n00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:49.590\nto make it more valuable to you to better\naddress the context that Daniel spoke\n\n364\n00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:52.990\nabout with regards to understanding\nhow to operate in your world.\n\n365\n00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:56.676\nWhat I hate to see when I talk to\ncustomers when I go on site is a rigid\n\n366\n00:19:56.676 --> 00:20:00.700\nadherence to a methodological approach\nthat doesn't work for them and\n\n367\n00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.589\nthat they're struggling with.\n\n368\n00:20:02.589 --> 00:20:05.290\nBut because somebody told them it's\nthis way or else, that they're doing it.\n\n369\n00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:07.570\nAnd they're not getting\nthe results they need and\n\n370\n00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:10.710\nthey know that there's a better path but\nthey're afraid to go down that road.\n\n371\n00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:13.520\nI would much prefer to\nhear from a customer,\n\n372\n00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:17.730\nhey we're trying this can you help us\nfigure out how to adjust it to our world.\n\n373\n00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:18.870\nRather than we're doing this and\n\n374\n00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:21.820\nwe have no idea what we're doing and\nit doesn't seem to be working.\n\n375\n00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:26.090\nBut because everybody else does it we're\njust being, essentially, a blind sheep.\n\n376\n00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:27.420\nWe're being led down that road, right?\n\n377\n00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:28.200\nWe're gonna do this as well.\n\n378\n00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:28.853\n&gt;&gt; The lemming, as it were.\n\n379\n00:20:28.853 --> 00:20:29.788\n[LAUGH] The lemming.\n\n380\n00:20:29.788 --> 00:20:30.430\n&gt;&gt; A lemming, right.\n\n381\n00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:31.340\nYeah, right.\nSo\n\n382\n00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:34.000\nthere's nothing wrong with the herd\nmentality in certain cases,\n\n383\n00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.260\nbut it can get you in a lot of trouble\nif you run off the cliff, right?\n\n384\n00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:41.440\nBecause everybody in front of you runs off\nthe cliff, it's not a good idea, right?\n\n385\n00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.040\nUsually there's a lot of people\nat the bottom of that cliff that\n\n386\n00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.960\nlooking up upon reflection would say\nthey would've chosen differently, right?\n\n387\n00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.620\nYou remember in here,\nwe talk about movies, right?\n\n388\n00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:51.530\nSo I'll give you one that I always love.\n\n389\n00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:55.715\nSo if you remember in Indiana Jones Jones\nand the Holy Grail, right,\n\n390\n00:20:55.715 --> 00:20:57.675\nThe crusade for the Holy Grail.\n\n391\n00:20:57.675 --> 00:21:01.585\nSo when he finally get,\nwhen Indiana Jones gets to the cave,\n\n392\n00:21:01.585 --> 00:21:03.965\nright, where the Knights Templar are,\nright?\n\n393\n00:21:03.965 --> 00:21:06.415\nSo you got the two, well, the one old\nknight, cuz the other one had passed away,\n\n394\n00:21:06.415 --> 00:21:08.485\nbut you have the old knight who's there,\nright?\n\n395\n00:21:08.485 --> 00:21:10.985\nAnd they're talking and\nthey go through the whole thing.\n\n396\n00:21:10.985 --> 00:21:14.625\nAnd the bad villains,\nright, the Nazi gentlemen,\n\n397\n00:21:14.625 --> 00:21:18.880\nthe guy who's represented the Nazis,\nand the doctor, the woman are there and\n\n398\n00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:23.250\nshe chooses the grail cup for\nhim the bad guy drinks from it, dies.\n\n399\n00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:27.930\nThen the knight turns to\nIndiana Jones in deadpan and\n\n400\n00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:32.770\nsays he chose poorly,\nchoose wisely, right?\n\n401\n00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:35.440\nSo same thing with the matrix with\nthe blue pill, red pill, right?\n\n402\n00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.100\nYou gotta choose wisely, right?\n\n403\n00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:39.030\nUpon reflection I would've\ntaken the other pill.\n\n404\n00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:41.292\n&gt;&gt; Why why didn't I choose the blue pill?\n\n405\n00:21:41.292 --> 00:21:42.211\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n406\n00:21:42.211 --> 00:21:44.801\ncuz you know red is the international\ncolor of danger, right, so\n\n407\n00:21:44.801 --> 00:21:46.920\nthat would have potentially given it away.\n\n408\n00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:50.914\nBut the point here is, don't be\nafraid to take this off the shelf and\n\n409\n00:21:50.914 --> 00:21:52.246\ncreate the context and\n\n410\n00:21:52.246 --> 00:21:57.104\nthe necessity to understand how to apply\nthis in your world and have it make sense.\n\n411\n00:21:57.104 --> 00:22:03.070\nI love to see customers, students,\npractitioners give good advice and really\n\n412\n00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:08.958\nadjust the requirements of the needs\nof the organization to the methodology.\n\n413\n00:22:08.958 --> 00:22:12.708\nAnd make sure, right, that they\nare aligning the two in such a way that\n\n414\n00:22:12.708 --> 00:22:16.717\nthe methodology in the requirements\nare in agreement and as a result of that\n\n415\n00:22:16.717 --> 00:22:20.620\nthey are able to really create\nthe outcomes they are looking for.\n\n416\n00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:25.410\nWhat I hate to see is a rigid and very\ndoctrinal approach to the methodology that\n\n417\n00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:29.690\ndoesn't take into account local variances\nand unfortunately really overlooks and\n\n418\n00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:31.950\ndiscounts a lot of things that\nimportant to the business,\n\n419\n00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:33.650\nthat's just a negative outcome for\neverybody.\n\n420\n00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:35.000\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n421\n00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.190\nRisk assessment is so\nimportant for what we do, so\n\n422\n00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:40.550\ncritical to the outcomes\nwe're looking to achieve.\n\n423\n00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:42.330\nWhen we think about documentation,\n\n424\n00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:45.170\ncreating the risk assessment\nmatrix is half the battle.\n\n425\n00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:48.000\nThe other half we talked about\nalready is the dynamic need for risk.\n\n426\n00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.100\nYou gotta have a schedule to go back and\nreassess these things.\n\n427\n00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:53.310\nAnd, again, there's no right and\nwrong here.\n\n428\n00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:57.310\nIt's not that you need to do\nthis once a year, twice a year.\n\n429\n00:22:57.310 --> 00:23:00.240\nI get that question from people\nall the time, how often?\n\n430\n00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.490\nThere's no such thing as too often, but\n\n431\n00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:06.289\nthere is such a thing as overcompensating,\n[LAUGH] right?\n\n432\n00:23:06.289 --> 00:23:09.373\nYou don't need to check on a risk\nassessment every month to make sure it's\n\n433\n00:23:09.373 --> 00:23:12.360\nvalid, aligned, and\nthat it's dynamically doing it's job.\n\n434\n00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.280\nYou're probably spending\ntoo much time on it.\n\n435\n00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:19.230\nOnce a quarter, every six months,\nat least once a year,\n\n436\n00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:21.400\nminimally, it has to be assessed.\n\n437\n00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:26.680\nBut I'll tell a lot of my customers, do\nthis as part of your BCVR refresh cycle.\n\n438\n00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.660\nWhen you're planning and getting ready for\nyour audit, you're doing the upgrade and\n\n439\n00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:33.730\nthe refresh on the BCVR plan,\nyou're checking for alignment and\n\n440\n00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:36.420\nvalidating that, yeah,\nwe still offer cloud services.\n\n441\n00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:38.050\nWe still need to be planning for that.\n\n442\n00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:39.816\nHey, you know what,\nwe got rid of the fax machine,\n\n443\n00:23:39.816 --> 00:23:41.392\nlet's kill that part of the plan and\nretool.\n\n444\n00:23:41.392 --> 00:23:45.200\nWhen you're doing all that work, whatever\nthe business cycle is around that for\n\n445\n00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.281\nthe year, that's a great time to go and\ndo the risk assessment and\n\n446\n00:23:48.281 --> 00:23:50.145\nensure that you still have alignment.\n\n447\n00:23:50.145 --> 00:23:51.441\nNow what we haven't really talked about.\n\n448\n00:23:51.441 --> 00:23:53.655\nAnd we'll get into more in one\nof our other conversations.\n\n449\n00:23:53.655 --> 00:23:57.194\nBut, I want to throw out there,\nsince we're having the conversation,\n\n450\n00:23:57.194 --> 00:23:58.130\nis the role of BIA.\n\n451\n00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:01.610\nThe business impact analysis\naround the risk assessment.\n\n452\n00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:03.590\nAnd partnered with it, essentially.\n\n453\n00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:05.910\nCombined in lockstep with it.\n\n454\n00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:07.880\nThe risk assessment.\n\n455\n00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.990\nAnd the outcome out it is gonna be\ncritical to our understanding of\n\n456\n00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:12.000\nto address RES.\n\n457\n00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.860\nBut what we often see and\nunderstand and hopefully you\n\n458\n00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:18.570\nare aware this is lot if you're not\nyou're about to become aware of it\n\n459\n00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:22.310\nis the link that's between risk assessment\nand the business impact analysis.\n\n460\n00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:25.847\nThe BIA the business impact\nanalysis helps us to understand\n\n461\n00:24:25.847 --> 00:24:30.457\nthe prioritize ranking of services in\nthe business at frozen moment in time.\n\n462\n00:24:30.457 --> 00:24:33.732\nAnd allows us to then\nwork with that ranking,\n\n463\n00:24:33.732 --> 00:24:37.181\nthat prioritized thought\nprocess to adjust and\n\n464\n00:24:37.181 --> 00:24:42.940\nlevel set the restoration plan for\nthose services during the CDR events.\n\n465\n00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:48.130\nThat is a direct derivative of\nan outcome of the risk assessment and\n\n466\n00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:51.090\nthe risk thought process we\nare engaging and talking about here.\n\n467\n00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:56.250\nAnd so we need to understand that these\nthings all essentially are commingling,\n\n468\n00:24:56.250 --> 00:25:00.740\nthey're enabling one another, and we have\nto understand that success in one area\n\n469\n00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:03.470\nleads to success in multiple\nareas in this regard.\n\n470\n00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:06.110\nIf we blow the risk assessment\nout of the water, and\n\n471\n00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:09.340\ndon't get it right,\nwe can't possibly do a good BIA and\n\n472\n00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:13.520\nwithout a good BIA, there's no way for\nus to understand what services Have to be\n\n473\n00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:17.880\naddressed when there's an outage due to an\nincident that we then have to respond to.\n\n474\n00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:21.970\nWe're gonna be fixing color printing, when\nwe should be fixing email, in other words.\n\n475\n00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:25.890\nAnd that's gonna lead to an imbalance and\nunfortunately negative outcomes.\n\n476\n00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:29.160\nAnd these are all parts of\nthe risk assessment methodology\n\n477\n00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:32.300\nthat we have to be thinking about and\nwe have to be addressing.\n\n478\n00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:34.312\nThere is [SOUND] excuse me.\n\n479\n00:25:34.312 --> 00:25:37.680\nA way for\nus to walk through a risk assessment.\n\n480\n00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.040\nThere is a formal methodology.\n\n481\n00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.410\nI want to share that with you.\n\n482\n00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:42.340\nReally think about and talk about that.\n\n483\n00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:45.740\nNIST has a risk assessment methodology.\n\n484\n00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:46.770\nIt's a nine step.\n\n485\n00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:48.420\nOr at least made up of nine primary steps.\n\n486\n00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:50.360\nI want to just go through\nthat with you quickly.\n\n487\n00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:53.190\nKind of help you to understand and\nthink through the process of that.\n\n488\n00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:55.770\nHere to keep me honest and\nmake sure I come up with nine terms and\n\n489\n00:25:55.770 --> 00:26:00.050\nif I don't, you're going to reach out and\nset me straight.\n\n490\n00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:01.980\nOkay?\nSo let's run through those nine steps\n\n491\n00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:02.480\nreal quick for you.\n\n492\n00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.260\nLet's make sure we\nunderstand what they are.\n\n493\n00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:06.980\nWe don't need the risk assessment matrix\nup on the screen, we'll just talk.\n\n494\n00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:07.740\nNo big deal.\n\n495\n00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:09.780\nSo system characterization.\n\n496\n00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:12.880\nThe NYST risk assessment methodology.\n\n497\n00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:13.980\nNine primary steps.\n\n498\n00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:20.020\nLet's do nine, five and four, or five and\nfour, or five and four, either or.\n\n499\n00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:20.520\nThat's nine.\n\n500\n00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:21.915\n&gt;&gt; As long as there is nine, right?\n\n501\n00:26:21.915 --> 00:26:22.682\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; As long as there's nine.\n\n502\n00:26:22.682 --> 00:26:24.590\nCircle of nine,\nthat's what we're talking about.\n\n503\n00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:27.260\nSo let's do the nine\nsystem characterizations.\n\n504\n00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:29.030\nStep number one in the methodology.\n\n505\n00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:30.900\nWe need to understand the system\nwe're assessing, right?\n\n506\n00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:34.050\nIn other words, is it a Windows\n7 work station with service pack\n\n507\n00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:34.980\none running Office 2016?\n\n508\n00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:38.956\nOr is it a Macintosh machine or\nis it a Linux machine?\n\n509\n00:26:38.956 --> 00:26:40.790\nOr is it a Windows server?\n\n510\n00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:42.010\nOr is it a virtual machine?\n\n511\n00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:43.270\nThis is important.\n\n512\n00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:47.250\nThere are variances and\ndifferences that must be accounted for.\n\n513\n00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:50.908\nAnd if we don't have good understanding\nof that, then how are we gonna possibly\n\n514\n00:26:50.908 --> 00:26:53.929\ndo all the other things and\nunderstand what the liabilities are?\n\n515\n00:26:53.929 --> 00:26:57.710\nThis gets down to with\nsystem characterization.\n\n516\n00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:59.360\nIdentifying and profiling in the system,\n\n517\n00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:03.520\nbut most importantly, the linkage here\nwould be back to something from the ITIL\n\n518\n00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:07.130\nframework that we often talk about\nwhich is configuration management.\n\n519\n00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:08.990\nIf you have good configuration management.\n\n520\n00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:09.900\nIf you have a CMDB.\n\n521\n00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.240\nA configuration management database.\n\n522\n00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.510\nAnd you have CIs, configuration items.\n\n523\n00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:19.450\nEntries in the CMDB that document for\nyou what your system build is.\n\n524\n00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:21.750\nHow would set up what\nyour baseline looks like.\n\n525\n00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:23.640\nIf you can rely on those things, and\n\n526\n00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:28.050\nyou have continuous monitoring that will\nstamp, essentially, those systems and\n\n527\n00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:32.397\nsay yes, at any given moment in time, that\nis the build, that if not, they will be\n\n528\n00:27:32.397 --> 00:27:36.875\nre-mediated back to the baseline away from\nthe deltas that have led to the changes.\n\n529\n00:27:36.875 --> 00:27:39.498\nIf that whole system is\nrunning behind the scenes,\n\n530\n00:27:39.498 --> 00:27:43.771\nsystem characterization is relatively\nstraightforward, right, because we can\n\n531\n00:27:43.771 --> 00:27:48.350\nbuild that understanding of the system\ndirectly from the outputs of that process.\n\n532\n00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:50.560\nIf we don't have any of the stuff\nI just mentioned to you,\n\n533\n00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:52.940\nwe can still do system characterization.\n\n534\n00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:55.830\nBut it's gonna be a lot more\nperson intensive to get it done\n\n535\n00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:57.830\nbecause we're not gonna\nhave the baselines and\n\n536\n00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:02.640\nthe standardization we need to rely on the\nfact that that system is built that way.\n\n537\n00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.100\nAnd if we can't validate that.\n\n538\n00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:06.930\nWe're gonna have to go figure it out\nourselves, and that's gonna take time.\n\n539\n00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:10.320\nAnd when we figure it out, there's no way\nto guarantee that that's gonna stay in\n\n540\n00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:15.080\nplace, and that that system is still gonna\noperate that way two months from now,\n\n541\n00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:17.390\nsix months from now,\nwhenever the case may be.\n\n542\n00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:21.100\nBut if we have all the control mechanisms\nin place behind the scenes The CMDB,\n\n543\n00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:25.320\nthe CI, so configuration management\ndatabase, the configuration items,\n\n544\n00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.850\nthe entries in the database.\n\n545\n00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:29.090\nWe have change management to support that.\n\n546\n00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:33.770\nIf we have continuous monitoring and\nremediation taking place to adjust\n\n547\n00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:37.500\nback to the baseline when we see deviation\nfrom norm, we're gonna be able to\n\n548\n00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:41.070\nrely on system characterization\nas an output of that process.\n\n549\n00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:43.040\nSo system characterization is number one.\n\n550\n00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.970\nThreat identification is number two.\n\n551\n00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:50.130\nWe've talked a lot about threat and\nthreat source and vulnerabilities and\n\n552\n00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:52.510\nattack and risk and\nidentified all those terms.\n\n553\n00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:54.720\nYou should know what they are,\nif you don't go back and\n\n554\n00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.140\nlisten to those discussions.\n\n555\n00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:58.400\nAnd make sure you're up to\ndate with your definitions.\n\n556\n00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:01.180\nBut threats and\nthreat identification is important.\n\n557\n00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:02.880\nThis is something we\nneed to understand right.\n\n558\n00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:06.940\nWe need to understand the potential\nimmediate risk, that may exist\n\n559\n00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:11.360\nif a threat source, a bad actor can\ntake advantage of a vulnerability and\n\n560\n00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:12.860\nuse that weakness against us.\n\n561\n00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:14.385\nBut, if there's no vulnerability,\n\n562\n00:29:14.385 --> 00:29:17.780\nthen there's likely to be no threat\nbecause there's no weakness to that\n\n563\n00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:22.220\nstraight actor, that's red source that\nthat actor can take advantage of, right?\n\n564\n00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:25.540\nSo, we need to have throughout\nidentification to understand for\n\n565\n00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:29.650\nchasing something that's legitimate, or\nif we were essentially overreacting to\n\n566\n00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:33.520\nsomething that's probably not gonna\nbe an issue, very unlikely to happen.\n\n567\n00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.220\nRight, you wanna keep that in mind.\n\n568\n00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:37.510\nThere are different types of\nthreats there are human threats,\n\n569\n00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:39.070\nthere are technical threats.\n\n570\n00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:41.690\nWanna understand the difference\nbetween those make sure we're\n\n571\n00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:42.780\ncomfortable with them.\n\n572\n00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:46.530\nTactical threats are things\nlike I miss configure system,\n\n573\n00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:48.540\nI didn't apply the patch\nwhere I should have,\n\n574\n00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:52.750\nI didn't document the right way human\nthreats are, I made a mistake, right.\n\n575\n00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:57.110\nI'm in there operating, I went ahead and\nput in the wrong user name and password.\n\n576\n00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:59.200\nAnd as a result maybe I locked myself out.\n\n577\n00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.160\nSo there is different kinds of threats.\n\n578\n00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:06.020\nThreat identification, in other words,\nhas to rely on both sides of that divide.\n\n579\n00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:08.930\nAnd there's a two-step\nprocess we engage in.\n\n580\n00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:11.230\nLift out threat source identification,\n\n581\n00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:15.000\nhave to understand where the threat source\nis, the bad actors are coming from.\n\n582\n00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.350\nWhat they are, who they are, and all the\nthings that we need to know about them.\n\n583\n00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:22.380\nAnd we also need to have or at least think\nabout and try to understand determination\n\n584\n00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:27.310\nor motivation and/or the kinds of\nactions that they may be engaging in.\n\n585\n00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:31.920\nSo if we are facing a bad actor\nas a threat source that is highly\n\n586\n00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:36.580\nmotivated because they're being paid by\na foreign entity to steal information\n\n587\n00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:40.100\nfrom an espionage perspective, that's\nsomething we wanna try to understand.\n\n588\n00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.310\nBecause they're likely,\n\n589\n00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:44.570\nto take certain actions that\nother actors may not take, right?\n\n590\n00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:46.040\nThey may not be as motivated.\n\n591\n00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.730\nIf it's somebody who's just kinda\ndriving by randomly, sees an opening,\n\n592\n00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:53.050\ntries to break in, but\nreally doesn't have any agenda,\n\n593\n00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:57.460\nthey don't have an they're not\nbeing paid by somebody, may or\n\n594\n00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:01.340\nmay not be of interest to them when they\nget in, they're less likely to go the next\n\n595\n00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:05.710\nstep and take those next steps and act in\nan aggressive way when they're challenged.\n\n596\n00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:07.300\nThey just disappear, right?\n\n597\n00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.350\nAnd as a result we need to\ntry to understand that.\n\n598\n00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:11.420\nNow, this is one of those gray areas,\nright?\n\n599\n00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:13.150\nCan you understand people's motivation?\n\n600\n00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:14.140\nCan you get in there heads?\n\n601\n00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:16.100\nCan you know what's driving them?\n\n602\n00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:16.920\nProbably not.\n\n603\n00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:17.480\nLet's be honest.\n\n604\n00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:21.130\nWe talked about this, we say it's\nimportant, we encourage you to do it.\n\n605\n00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:25.360\nBut we know at least, we should know\nthat's highly unlikely that you're gonna\n\n606\n00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:28.570\nbe able to really discern a lot\nof this at least not upfront.\n\n607\n00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:31.490\nYou make it's after the fact,\nyou may understand.\n\n608\n00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:34.440\nAfter the fact when you do\nthe debunking of the incident.\n\n609\n00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:38.640\nYou do the after incident report and maybe\nyou're lucky enough to catch somebody.\n\n610\n00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.470\nOr at least see tell tale\nsigns of what they've done.\n\n611\n00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:43.550\nAnd you can then interrogate them and\nunderstand what's happened.\n\n612\n00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:45.060\nMaybe you get the motivation angle.\n\n613\n00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:48.463\nBut the reality is while it's going on,\nit's very unlikely you're gonna know.\n\n614\n00:31:48.463 --> 00:31:50.135\nUnless it's politically motivated.\n\n615\n00:31:50.135 --> 00:31:54.238\nThey make it clear through activity,\nthrough slogans, through defacement,\n\n616\n00:31:54.238 --> 00:31:57.791\nthrough things like that That this\nhad something to do with you know,\n\n617\n00:31:57.791 --> 00:32:00.260\nXYZ, this is my agenda,\nthis is my manifesto.\n\n618\n00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:03.340\nThis is why I'm here,\nyou get a percentage of that.\n\n619\n00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:05.370\nBut the reality is most attacks?\n\n620\n00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:07.878\nThey're not motivated by those things,\npeople have an agenda but\n\n621\n00:32:07.878 --> 00:32:11.220\nthey're not usually making it publicly\navailable and sharing it with you.\n\n622\n00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:13.826\nAnd the other reality,\nbrutal though it is to admit to and\n\n623\n00:32:13.826 --> 00:32:15.250\nyou have to know about this is.\n\n624\n00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:19.515\nThe people that are good at what they do,\nthe hackers that get in and are ghosts and\n\n625\n00:32:19.515 --> 00:32:20.477\njust come and go.\n\n626\n00:32:20.477 --> 00:32:21.647\nYou're never gonna find them and\n\n627\n00:32:21.647 --> 00:32:24.490\nyou're never gonna know what motivates\nthem cuz they're not gonna leave behind\n\n628\n00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:27.060\nanything that's gonna identify\nthem in the first place.\n\n629\n00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:28.796\nIt's the people that are careless,\n\n630\n00:32:28.796 --> 00:32:32.164\nit's the people that really don't\nknow what they're doing, right?\n\n631\n00:32:32.164 --> 00:32:36.335\nThat of people that we tend to catch, the\nexperts, the professionals that are doing\n\n632\n00:32:36.335 --> 00:32:39.644\nthis, that are motivated by\npolitical agendas, by money, etc.\n\n633\n00:32:39.644 --> 00:32:42.971\nThey're usually highly paid because\nthey're good and if they're good,\n\n634\n00:32:42.971 --> 00:32:44.036\nthey're like ninjas.\n\n635\n00:32:44.036 --> 00:32:45.701\nI mean, they just come and\ngo in the darkness,\n\n636\n00:32:45.701 --> 00:32:47.387\nyou just don't know they're there, right?\n\n637\n00:32:47.387 --> 00:32:51.256\nIt's really cool to watch them work if you\ncan observe them, but they're gonna get in\n\n638\n00:32:51.256 --> 00:32:54.659\nand out, you're just not gonna have\nthat any evidence t hat's tangible.\n\n639\n00:32:54.659 --> 00:32:57.289\nAnd the only thing you can leave\nbehind is probably misinformation,\n\n640\n00:32:57.289 --> 00:32:59.554\npurposely planted to distract you so\nthat they can go off and\n\n641\n00:32:59.554 --> 00:33:01.430\ndo something else without\nyou being aware of it.\n\n642\n00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:05.130\nSo system characterization,\nthreat identification,\n\n643\n00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:07.460\ntwo different types of threats,\nhuman and technical.\n\n644\n00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:10.920\nWanna make sure we understand threat\nsource identification, and determination\n\n645\n00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:15.040\nand motivation are the two steps in\nthe threat identification process.\n\n646\n00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.760\nItem number three,\nidentify the vulnerabilities.\n\n647\n00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.780\nGotta find those weaknesses, right?\n\n648\n00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:20.840\nIt's like Pokemon,\ngotta catch them all, right?\n\n649\n00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:23.288\nIdentify vulnerabilities, very important.\n\n650\n00:33:23.288 --> 00:33:26.684\nIf we don't know what the weaknesses are,\nhow could we possibly put our defenses in\n\n651\n00:33:26.684 --> 00:33:28.734\nplace in the areas where\nthey can do the most good.\n\n652\n00:33:28.734 --> 00:33:32.071\nNow, that sounds easy, but then you say,\nbut Adam, if we knew all the weaknesses,\n\n653\n00:33:32.071 --> 00:33:35.320\nall the vulnerabilities, we wouldn't\nhave to worry about anybody breaking in.\n\n654\n00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:38.410\nWe would just stand on the border and\njust protect ourselves, and\n\n655\n00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:39.440\nthat would be the end of it.\n\n656\n00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:41.250\nRemember, Few Good Men, right?\n\n657\n00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:43.400\nHaving breakfast with Jack right out\nthere in the middle of the field in\n\n658\n00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:44.910\nGuantanamo, right?\n\n659\n00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:48.310\nI eat breakfast 100 yards away from\npeople trying to kill me, right?\n\n660\n00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:51.745\nThat's a great line by the way, I love\nthat movie, it's just a great movie.\n\n661\n00:33:51.745 --> 00:33:55.426\nBut the reality is that we can\nanticipate a lot of stuff, but\n\n662\n00:33:55.426 --> 00:33:58.085\nwe're not gonna anticipate everything.\n\n663\n00:33:58.085 --> 00:33:59.790\nI mean, let's be honest, right?\n\n664\n00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:02.570\nAre you gonna be able to find every\nvulnerability in every piece of software\n\n665\n00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:06.510\nin every system that you run,\ntoday, tomorrow, a year from now?\n\n666\n00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:07.990\nIf you can, you and\n\n667\n00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:10.380\nI should partner up cuz we're\ngonna make a lot of money, right?\n\n668\n00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:12.370\nThere's just no way to do this.\n\n669\n00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:14.550\nI mean there are just\nunknown vulnerabilities,\n\n670\n00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:18.830\nunknown weaknesses that exist very deeply\nin the configurations of the software of\n\n671\n00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:22.630\nthose systems that have not come to\nlight because nobody's done the things\n\n672\n00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:25.140\nthat would bring them to light\nuntil somebody figures it out.\n\n673\n00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:27.045\n&gt;&gt; Right, just because you can't\nknow them all doesn't mean you\n\n674\n00:34:27.045 --> 00:34:29.070\nshouldn't be attempting to try to do that.\n\n675\n00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:31.600\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely not, and more importantly,\njust because you can't know them all,\n\n676\n00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:33.020\ndoesn't mean they don't exist, right?\n\n677\n00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:35.940\nI mean, this is that ostrich head in\nthe sand that we talk about, right?\n\n678\n00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:39.400\nIf you bury your head in the sand and\npretend it's not there, it's still there,\n\n679\n00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:42.010\nyou're just not seeing it when\nit comes to get you, right?\n\n680\n00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:45.144\nAnd you may be that person that doesn't\nwanna know about it till it happen,\n\n681\n00:34:45.144 --> 00:34:45.807\nthat's fine.\n\n682\n00:34:45.807 --> 00:34:47.853\nBut I'd rather be eyes wide open, right?\n\n683\n00:34:47.853 --> 00:34:50.650\nCaveat emptor, buyer beware, right?\n\n684\n00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:54.890\nI would rather be eyes wide open,\nsee it coming, and have a chance to react.\n\n685\n00:34:54.890 --> 00:34:58.337\nAs a security professional,\neven if it means that you get past me.\n\n686\n00:34:58.337 --> 00:35:01.239\nBut if I have a good enterprise\nsecurity architecture and\n\n687\n00:35:01.239 --> 00:35:02.754\ndefense in depth mentality.\n\n688\n00:35:02.754 --> 00:35:06.918\nAnd I've built out my infrastructure in\nsuch a way that I've got overlapping,\n\n689\n00:35:06.918 --> 00:35:11.096\nmutually reinforcing levels and\nlayers of controls, and counter-measure.\n\n690\n00:35:11.096 --> 00:35:12.761\nYou may get past one or more of them.\n\n691\n00:35:12.761 --> 00:35:14.668\nYou may even get past\nthe majority of them.\n\n692\n00:35:14.668 --> 00:35:17.148\nOn occasion,\nyou may even get past all of them, but\n\n693\n00:35:17.148 --> 00:35:21.368\nthat doesn't mean that you're gonna get in\nand out without being recorded, caught.\n\n694\n00:35:21.368 --> 00:35:24.902\nAnd/or somehow that you're gonna leave\nbehind enough information that I'm\n\n695\n00:35:24.902 --> 00:35:28.339\ngonna be able to figure out where you\nlive and find you at some point, right?\n\n696\n00:35:28.339 --> 00:35:30.190\nI think that's the ultimate goal of this.\n\n697\n00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:32.137\nI may not be able to\nstop you on the way in.\n\n698\n00:35:32.137 --> 00:35:34.470\nI may not be able to prevent\nyou from getting back out.\n\n699\n00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:39.579\nBut if I can get enough information about\nyou as you transit through our systems.\n\n700\n00:35:39.579 --> 00:35:42.387\nI'm gonna find you at some point,\nit's only a matter of time and\n\n701\n00:35:42.387 --> 00:35:44.900\nthat's what incident\nresponse may boil down to.\n\n702\n00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:47.380\nIt may be a reactive\nresponse after the attack.\n\n703\n00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:50.770\nBut if you have enough information,\nyou may be able to respond appropriately\n\n704\n00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:54.650\nthe next time that same perpetrator or\nsame attack's propagated against you.\n\n705\n00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:56.473\nAnd that's something to consider and\nbe aware of.\n\n706\n00:35:56.473 --> 00:35:59.703\nIn other words there are shades of grey\nwhen it comes to winning and loosing.\n\n707\n00:35:59.703 --> 00:36:02.190\nThat's what I'm trying to suggest\nto you and in this business.\n\n708\n00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:05.450\nPeople will say defensively, you gotta\nstop all the tax at the gate way.\n\n709\n00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:07.370\nIf you don't do that,\nyou're not doing your job.\n\n710\n00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:08.460\nI couldn't disagree more.\n\n711\n00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:11.160\nI just do not buy into\nthat mentality at all.\n\n712\n00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:13.200\nI think that is a very\nimportant statement.\n\n713\n00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:15.480\nI think it's an important criteria\nto measure yourself against.\n\n714\n00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.720\nIt's a valuable goal we\nshould reach towards.\n\n715\n00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:20.824\nBut it's unrealistic to say that\nyou're going to achieve that and\n\n716\n00:36:20.824 --> 00:36:24.161\nit's unrealistic to say,\nthat's what you bet success or failure on.\n\n717\n00:36:24.161 --> 00:36:27.615\nBecause people are gonna be better\nthan you, everyday no matter what.\n\n718\n00:36:27.615 --> 00:36:29.280\nAnd you're always gonna come up and\n\n719\n00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.956\nsomebody that understands\nthat system better than you.\n\n720\n00:36:31.956 --> 00:36:34.190\nAnd can find a weakness\nyou have not uncovered.\n\n721\n00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:35.169\nIt's only a matter of time.\n\n722\n00:36:35.169 --> 00:36:38.405\nAnd if your mentality is I\neither stop you or I lose,\n\n723\n00:36:38.405 --> 00:36:42.037\nyou might as well go home right now,\nstop watching this.\n\n724\n00:36:42.037 --> 00:36:46.134\nDon't interact with us cuz you're not\ngonna be able to be successful in this\n\n725\n00:36:46.134 --> 00:36:49.370\norganizational thought\nprocess called IT security.\n\n726\n00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:51.570\nAnd you're not gonna enjoy what you do.\n\n727\n00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:56.530\nBecause you're gonna be unfortunately\nhanded a series of stunning losses\n\n728\n00:36:56.530 --> 00:37:00.200\nat your own expense because\nthings are not gonna go your way.\n\n729\n00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:01.290\nAnd to be brutally honest with you,\n\n730\n00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:03.780\nI want you to understand that,\nnot because I wanna scare you off.\n\n731\n00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:05.610\nQuite the opposite, I want you to do this.\n\n732\n00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:06.770\nI want you to be passionate about it.\n\n733\n00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:09.410\nI want you to feel like Daniel and\nI feel about this, and\n\n734\n00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:12.230\neverybody else who does this for\na living feels.\n\n735\n00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:14.450\nBut I want you to be\nhonest with yourself and\n\n736\n00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:17.800\nhonest with your employer about\nwhat you can and cannot do.\n\n737\n00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:22.960\nAnd I want you to be realistic about what\nexpectations are and what success equals.\n\n738\n00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:26.060\nI tell customers all the time, it's okay\n\n739\n00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:30.460\nif something bad happens as long as we\naddress it and it doesn't keep happening.\n\n740\n00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:35.080\nIt's not okay if we don't address it, and\nthe same thing happens to you ten times in\n\n741\n00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:37.950\na row because you don't learn\nyour lesson the first night.\n\n742\n00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:39.530\nThen, that's a negative outcome.\n\n743\n00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:40.720\nI didn't do my job.\n\n744\n00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:41.715\nI failed you.\n\n745\n00:37:41.715 --> 00:37:44.737\nBut if I stop that after the first or\nsecond time, and\n\n746\n00:37:44.737 --> 00:37:46.463\nit doesn't happen anymore.\n\n747\n00:37:46.463 --> 00:37:50.140\nThen I've done my job and\nwe're both safer as a result of that.\n\n748\n00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:51.900\nThat's the methodology.\n\n749\n00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:54.780\nAnd the idea and the thought process,\nthe cultural ethos,\n\n750\n00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:58.180\nyou need to have around this in\nyour mind as we talk through this.\n\n751\n00:37:58.180 --> 00:37:59.780\nSystem characterization, number one.\n\n752\n00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:01.710\nThread identification, number two.\n\n753\n00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:03.318\nIdentify vulnerabilities, number three.\n\n754\n00:38:03.318 --> 00:38:05.690\nRemember, you can't identify\nall vulnerabilities.\n\n755\n00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:08.740\nThere are unknown ones and\nit's okay not to know everything, right?\n\n756\n00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:13.990\nControl analysis, identify and\nunderstand based on identification of\n\n757\n00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:17.850\nvulnerabilities and threat identification,\nand system characterization.\n\n758\n00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:20.550\nWhich controls and\ncountermeasures are in place now?\n\n759\n00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:24.570\nWhich ones are successful given\nthe threat profile we face?\n\n760\n00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:27.870\nAnd which ones are not successful,\nnot gonna be helpful?\n\n761\n00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:31.420\nAnd which ones don't exist that may\nbe necessary to be brought online or\n\n762\n00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:34.740\nimplemented to offset\nthis particular threat or\n\n763\n00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:36.700\nvulnerability that we\nare trying to address.\n\n764\n00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:40.410\nIn other words,\nunderstand the as-is current state\n\n765\n00:38:40.410 --> 00:38:44.350\nagainst the liabilities you\nare cataloging and facing.\n\n766\n00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:45.930\nAre you up to the task, if so, great.\n\n767\n00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:49.191\nIf not, what do we gotta do to bridge\nthat gap between where we are and\n\n768\n00:38:49.191 --> 00:38:50.480\nwhere we wanna be?\n\n769\n00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:53.030\nThis is an as is to be conversation,\nright?\n\n770\n00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:56.310\nAnd then we get into likelihood,\ndetermination, and\n\n771\n00:38:56.310 --> 00:39:00.130\ncost benefit analysis around whether\nwe can afford those counter measures\n\n772\n00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:02.810\nin order to offset the risk and\nthe threat that we're facing.\n\n773\n00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:04.940\nAnd this becomes part of\nthe methodology as well.\n\n774\n00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:07.100\nSo we have system characterization.\n\n775\n00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:09.690\nThreat identification,\nidentify vulnerabilities,\n\n776\n00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:12.730\ncontrol analysis,\nlikelihood determination.\n\n777\n00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:15.890\nHow likely is it that what we're\ntalking about is gonna happen, right?\n\n778\n00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:16.980\nVery important to understand that.\n\n779\n00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:20.710\nImpact analysis, number six.\n\n780\n00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:22.750\nHow, when it does happen,\nhow likely is it to happen?\n\n781\n00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:25.090\nWhen it does,\nas we've talked about before,\n\n782\n00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:26.470\nhow bad is it gonna hurt us, right?\n\n783\n00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:30.300\nSo what's it gonna cost us and\nhow much is it gonna take to fix that?\n\n784\n00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:32.086\nNumber seven, risk determination.\n\n785\n00:39:32.086 --> 00:39:34.427\nSo we wanna think about all\nthe things we've talked about.\n\n786\n00:39:34.427 --> 00:39:38.448\nAnd then overall, what's the perception of\nthe risk within the organization shaped by\n\n787\n00:39:38.448 --> 00:39:40.857\nall of these other factors\nwe've been discussing?\n\n788\n00:39:40.857 --> 00:39:43.985\nProbability of occurrence,\nhard tangible and soft or\n\n789\n00:39:43.985 --> 00:39:48.955\nintangible costs associated with that\noccurrence, we've been talking about that.\n\n790\n00:39:48.955 --> 00:39:52.428\nAnd also, the controls and/or\nthe countermeasures that are deployed to\n\n791\n00:39:52.428 --> 00:39:53.667\naddress these concerns.\n\n792\n00:39:53.667 --> 00:39:59.248\nRisk determination is the summation of\nall the other six steps we've identified,\n\n793\n00:39:59.248 --> 00:40:03.882\nbrought together and cataloged in\na top to bottom, side to side way.\n\n794\n00:40:03.882 --> 00:40:08.638\nThat allows us to understand tangibly, and\nintangibly what the impact to risk is, and\n\n795\n00:40:08.638 --> 00:40:11.430\nwhat it's gonna do to us if it does occur.\n\n796\n00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:13.255\nNumber eight, what are we at,\nnumber eight?\n\n797\n00:40:13.255 --> 00:40:13.755\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n798\n00:40:13.755 --> 00:40:14.660\n&gt;&gt; Right, number eight, there we go.\n\n799\n00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:16.090\nI'm a little challenged by fingers.\n\n800\n00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:16.800\nBut you know what I can do?\n\n801\n00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.705\nI can do that with no trouble.\n\n802\n00:40:18.705 --> 00:40:20.072\nYou know what that is?\n\n803\n00:40:20.072 --> 00:40:21.927\n&gt;&gt; Well, that is the-\n&gt;&gt; Live long and prosper.\n\n804\n00:40:21.927 --> 00:40:25.296\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\nthis is the Jewish thing, right?\n\n805\n00:40:25.296 --> 00:40:26.624\n&gt;&gt; No, this is the Spock thing.\n\n806\n00:40:26.624 --> 00:40:30.124\n&gt;&gt; This is the Spock thing but\nthis is also a Jewish thing.\n\n807\n00:40:30.124 --> 00:40:31.455\n&gt;&gt; That's just the person who\ndoesn't know how to do this.\n\n808\n00:40:31.455 --> 00:40:31.957\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n809\n00:40:31.957 --> 00:40:33.164\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n810\n00:40:33.164 --> 00:40:34.456\n&gt;&gt; I cold have swore-\n&gt;&gt; If you do that.\n\n811\n00:40:34.456 --> 00:40:34.956\nThat's for somebody who can't do this.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n812\n00:40:34.956 --> 00:40:37.023\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's all that is, at least as\n\n813\n00:40:37.023 --> 00:40:41.484\nfar as I know, I don't know, there may be\na secret Jewish thing that goes like this.\n\n814\n00:40:41.484 --> 00:40:42.189\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think there is,\n\n815\n00:40:42.189 --> 00:40:42.794\n&gt;&gt; But I'm jewish and I've never\n\n816\n00:40:42.794 --> 00:40:45.318\nheard of that thing, so I don't know.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'll have to look that up cuz now\n\n817\n00:40:45.318 --> 00:40:47.350\nit's gonna bug me [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Maybe, but I didn't get\n\n818\n00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:50.067\nthat in my welcome packet when they said,\nhere you are, this is what it means,\n\n819\n00:40:50.067 --> 00:40:52.730\nthey didn't say by the way,\nthere's this thing, so I don't know.\n\n820\n00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:55.470\nBut you may be right,\nI could be wrong, you never know.\n\n821\n00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:58.200\nBut anyway, back to what we're talking\nabout, that was our random aside for\n\n822\n00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:59.570\nthis episode by the way.\n\n823\n00:40:59.570 --> 00:41:02.550\nSo risk determination,\ncontrol recommendations,\n\n824\n00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:06.240\ngotta think about which controls\nmay be offered today that are good.\n\n825\n00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:07.230\nBut as I said earlier,\n\n826\n00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:10.108\nwhich ones are not being offered\nthat we may need to bring to bear.\n\n827\n00:41:10.108 --> 00:41:13.564\nWe have to as in instead of responders and\nrisk assessors make those those\n\n828\n00:41:13.564 --> 00:41:16.624\nrecommendations and figure out\nhow to then say hey, by the way,\n\n829\n00:41:16.624 --> 00:41:20.850\nwe should be doing this, this, and this,\nin order to offset these concerns.\n\n830\n00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:22.660\nAnd finally, results documentation.\n\n831\n00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:24.280\nGotta document everything we do.\n\n832\n00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:27.540\nAny conversation, anything we have in this\nentire area of all these conversations.\n\n833\n00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:29.867\nIf I never, ever say, hey, by the way,\n\n834\n00:41:29.867 --> 00:41:33.990\nwe should always document it at\nthe last statement, then call me on it.\n\n835\n00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:37.130\nBecause the last statement we make always\nis by the way, that you document that.\n\n836\n00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:39.930\nAnd if you did, did you do so\nin a way that everybody understands.\n\n837\n00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:43.466\nSo not just results documentation,\nbut thorough communication,\n\n838\n00:41:43.466 --> 00:41:44.775\naudience appropriate.\n\n839\n00:41:44.775 --> 00:41:49.070\nAnd everybody aware of how to interact\nwith it is what we're after here.\n\n840\n00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:51.700\nThese are the nine\nmethodological steps that NIST\n\n841\n00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:54.060\nhas put together with\nregards to risk assessment.\n\n842\n00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:56.670\nWanna make sure you're comfortable\nwith them in this conversation.\n\n843\n00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:58.210\nVery important.\n\n844\n00:41:58.210 --> 00:42:01.230\nGenerically, in any of our episodes,\nwe've talked about this stuff.\n\n845\n00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:03.500\nWhenever we have a procedure, a process,\n\n846\n00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:07.120\na set of steps,\nlinear progression through an idea.\n\n847\n00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:08.650\nThose are key indicators for\n\n848\n00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:11.730\nyou that maybe that's something you wanna\npay attention to for several reasons.\n\n849\n00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:15.560\nNumber one, obviously important from\na process perspective, to be able to take\n\n850\n00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:19.300\nthat in the real world and apply that, to\nmake sure you're doing it the right way.\n\n851\n00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:23.300\nNumber two, love to ask questions about\nthat kind of stuff on the exam, right?\n\n852\n00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:25.176\nHey, what's that nine step process?\n\n853\n00:42:25.176 --> 00:42:27.650\nIt's in an order here,\ngot four different options for you.\n\n854\n00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:29.190\nWhich one makes the most sense?\n\n855\n00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:31.630\nEasily see lots of ways\nto ask those questions.\n\n856\n00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:33.900\nMaybe a drag and drop,\nright, that says, hey,\n\n857\n00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:37.040\nhere's ten steps on the left,\nhere's nine boxes.\n\n858\n00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:37.930\nWhat order do they go in?\n\n859\n00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:40.200\nAnd by the way,\nwhich ones are ones don't apply?\n\n860\n00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:42.690\nI mean, I can think of lots of\nways to ask those questions.\n\n861\n00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:45.060\nThankfully, for you,\nI'm not writing those questions.\n\n862\n00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:49.560\nBut, if I was, I'd be doing one or more of\nthose things, and as a guide for you for\n\n863\n00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:51.330\nstudying, you should be\ndoing the same thing.\n\n864\n00:42:51.330 --> 00:42:54.100\nThink about how to take this knowledge and\napply it, and\n\n865\n00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:57.410\nmake sure you understand,\nnot just how to memorize and regurgitate.\n\n866\n00:42:57.410 --> 00:42:59.010\nThat's the easy part, right?\n\n867\n00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:02.230\nBut how can you take it contextually,\napply it to a scenario or\n\n868\n00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:04.860\na word problem, and\nmake the right determination?\n\n869\n00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:07.684\nBecause that's another kind of question\nthat you're likely to see on not just\n\n870\n00:43:07.684 --> 00:43:08.250\nthis example.\n\n871\n00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:11.410\nBut any of these examples associated\nwith any of the bodies of knowledge and\n\n872\n00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:13.170\nareas that we talk about, right?\n\n873\n00:43:13.170 --> 00:43:15.180\nIt's not just about blind memorization.\n\n874\n00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:18.460\nIf you can't apply the knowledge,\nyou're not actually able to show\n\n875\n00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:22.940\nunderstanding of and\nthe ability to apply that knowledge.\n\n876\n00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:25.180\nYou're not using the knowledge\nappropriately and you're not gonna be,\n\n877\n00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:28.040\nunfortunately, you're not gonna be\ngood at doing this in the real world.\n\n878\n00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:32.020\nIt's a true test of how well you're able\nto take these skills and translate them.\n\n879\n00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:32.914\nSo, it's just something to consider,\nsomething to think about.\n\n880\n00:43:32.914 --> 00:43:37.700\n&gt;&gt; Adam, talking a lot about risk today.\n\n881\n00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:41.145\nAnd it was nice to see the risk matrix,\nwe're not out there in the wind all by\n\n882\n00:43:41.145 --> 00:43:43.590\nourselves, trying to figure\nthings out on our own.\n\n883\n00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:47.214\nI mean you might be doing that, but know\nthis, there are helps out there for you.\n\n884\n00:43:47.214 --> 00:43:49.450\nYou just have to be able\nto know where they're at.\n\n885\n00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:53.130\nAdam, you have steered us in that right\ndirection yet again, we appreciate that.\n\n886\n00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:55.180\nAnd we do appreciate you guys for\nwatching, but\n\n887\n00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:58.060\nwe are well out of time for this episode.\n\n888\n00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:01.557\nWe are gonna have to move into more\nrisk in part three, the riskening,\n\n889\n00:44:01.557 --> 00:44:02.522\nif that's a word.\n\n890\n00:44:02.522 --> 00:44:03.540\nI'm making it up right now.\n\n891\n00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:04.450\n&gt;&gt; Is it like the awakening?\n\n892\n00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:05.090\nThe riskening?\n\n893\n00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:06.070\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, it'll be fun.\n\n894\n00:44:06.070 --> 00:44:07.000\n&gt;&gt; Or the quickening.\n&gt;&gt; We'll have a good time doing it.\n\n895\n00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.050\n&gt;&gt; It's the Highlander.\n\n896\n00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:09.090\n&gt;&gt; That's right, the Highlander series.\n\n897\n00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:09.750\nThat's right.\n\n898\n00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:11.830\nSo, join us there in part three.\n\n899\n00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:15.660\nBut as for this one, it's time for us to\nsign off for ITProTV, I've been your host,\n\n900\n00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:16.600\nDaniel Lowry.\n\n901\n00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:18.860\n&gt;&gt; I'm a very likely to happen risk.\n\n902\n00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:19.800\nBut I'm fun to play with.\n\n903\n00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:20.980\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n904\n00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:22.416\n&gt;&gt; See you all next time,\neverybody, take

00:00:08.243\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.243 --> 00:00:12.118\n&gt;&gt; You're watch ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.118 --> 00:00:13.910\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.390\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.620\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode, we are back.\n\n8\n00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.690\nThat's right,\nwith more on our ECIH series.\n\n9\n00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.160\nThat's right-\n&gt;&gt; You did very well.\n\n10\n00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.510\n&gt;&gt; I know, I like to enunciate.\n\n11\n00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:29.640\n&gt;&gt; You do.\n&gt;&gt; Really, add some pause-\n\n12\n00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.760\n&gt;&gt; Very slow, methodical, very melodical.\n\n13\n00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.895\n&gt;&gt; And that being said, you hear\nthe disembodied voice standing next to me\n\n14\n00:00:34.895 --> 00:00:37.075\ncracking wise because he is wise.\n\n15\n00:00:37.075 --> 00:00:38.765\nOur good friend, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n16\n00:00:38.765 --> 00:00:39.435\nAdam, welcome back, man.\n\n17\n00:00:39.435 --> 00:00:42.187\n&gt;&gt; I've been accused of being many things,\nwise is typically not one of them.\n\n18\n00:00:42.187 --> 00:00:43.675\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I do appreciate that\n\n19\n00:00:43.675 --> 00:00:44.655\nvote of confidence.\n\n20\n00:00:44.655 --> 00:00:47.515\nI'm doing well,\nhopefully everybody out there is also.\n\n21\n00:00:47.515 --> 00:00:51.915\nSo we're gonna continue our conversations\nalong the lines of risk and\n\n22\n00:00:51.915 --> 00:00:56.630\nwhat risk may or may not mean to you\nin the general thought process, in\n\n23\n00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.400\nthe context of the business, and certainly\nin relationship to incident handling.\n\n24\n00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.520\nWe've been talking a lot, especially\nin our last episode, about risk,\n\n25\n00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.865\nrisk assessment,\nrisk analysis, risk management.\n\n26\n00:01:06.865 --> 00:01:10.126\nEncourage you to go back, take a look at\nthat, make sure you have the context for\n\n27\n00:01:10.126 --> 00:01:11.840\nthe conversation rolling forward here.\n\n28\n00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.946\nIf you haven't been through that it's\ndefinitely a very good episode for\n\n29\n00:01:14.946 --> 00:01:15.859\nyou to take a look at.\n\n30\n00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:19.276\nI think it lays down a lot of the\nfoundational thought process, right, and\n\n31\n00:01:19.276 --> 00:01:22.108\nthe dialogue that we're having and\ncontinuing to have here.\n\n32\n00:01:22.108 --> 00:01:27.334\nLeft off talking about the nisk\nrisk assessment methodology,\n\n33\n00:01:27.334 --> 00:01:30.005\nnine steps involved with that.\n\n34\n00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:31.810\nMake sure you're familiar with that.\n\n35\n00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.710\nThe end of the last conversation,\ngonna pull that forward a little bit,\n\n36\n00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.400\nand look at risk and risk management,\n\n37\n00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.020\nrisk assessment,\nfrom a slightly different perspective.\n\n38\n00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.740\nHow do we think about risk\nassessment in the workplace, right?\n\n39\n00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.140\nI mean generically we can approach this\nfrom a lot of different perspectives, but\n\n40\n00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.980\nwe have to think about the workplace and\nassessment of risk and how we may do that.\n\n41\n00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.650\nSomething a little bit more tangible,\npractical, and\n\n42\n00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.570\nreal, with regards to\nwhat we do every day.\n\n43\n00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.520\nWant to walk you through general\nthough process there, right.\n\n44\n00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.870\nWe may have three or four, maybe five,\n\n45\n00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.060\nsteps that we'd want to engage and\nthink about.\n\n46\n00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.020\nThings such as identification of hazards,\nright, what may or\n\n47\n00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.910\nmay not be problematic in the workplace,\nand what we would want to consider, and\n\n48\n00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.340\ncertainly take advantage of.\n\n49\n00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.220\nI don't know, and\n\n50\n00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.700\nwe don't often show you the floor in the\nstudio while we're doing work here, but\n\n51\n00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.680\nI know that we certainly have the caution\ntape around where the monitors are.\n\n52\n00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.160\nI don't know if we could get\na shot of the electroduct\n\n53\n00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.740\nthat's sitting down here\ncovering the wires.\n\n54\n00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:25.930\nI don't if we have a camera for that.\n\n55\n00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.560\nBut we have a lot of wiring on the floor\nin the studio and we have the plastic kind\n\n56\n00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.470\nof coverage that goes over it, it's almost\nlike a little mat that we lay down to make\n\n57\n00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.410\nsure nobody, specifically myself probably\nmore than anybody else, trips over it.\n\n58\n00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.200\nBut you've probably seen this kinda stuff\nif you've worked in data centers or\n\n59\n00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.260\nworked in areas where there's\na lot of wiring, right.\n\n60\n00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.280\nIt's just a way to create safety, right,\nfor people that are walking around and\n\n61\n00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.260\ninteracting.\n\n62\n00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.900\nAnd so the idea is that when we identify\nhazards, we're able to go through and\n\n63\n00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.400\nvery quickly and hopefully easily identify\nareas that may be problematic, and create\n\n64\n00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.710\nsome sort of warning or some sort of\nmechanism to identify the danger, right.\n\n65\n00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.706\nAnd make sure that as a result,\npeople are paying attention.\n\n66\n00:03:04.706 --> 00:03:08.440\nWe need to determine who can be harmed and\nunder what circumstances by\n\n67\n00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.880\nwhatever activities you may engage in or\nidentify as being hazardous.\n\n68\n00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.100\nSo, if we're worried about a trip hazard,\nthen we would say that anybody that\n\n69\n00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.500\noperates in this area, that walks back and\nforth, may be harmed by this.\n\n70\n00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.660\nAnd obviously want to make sure that\nwe're taking steps to prevent that.\n\n71\n00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:22.380\nIt's very, very important.\n\n72\n00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.110\nYou know, I was in the last couple\nof months, I was working for\n\n73\n00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.293\na customer in their data center and\n\n74\n00:03:28.293 --> 00:03:33.690\nI was moving some materials and\nsome equipment, things like that, around.\n\n75\n00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.830\nAnd I had a group of people that were\nhelping me, we're moving some racks and\n\n76\n00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:37.790\nthings like that.\n\n77\n00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.730\nAnd you've been in data centers,\n\n78\n00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.920\nwe have raised flooring in a lot\nof these data centers, right.\n\n79\n00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.570\nThere's plenum and crawl space\nboth above and below typically.\n\n80\n00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.030\nAnd you have air flow that's being\ncreated underneath the floor,\n\n81\n00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.350\nwhich is why you have the raised floor.\n\n82\n00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.720\nSo somebody pulled up a bunch of tiles,\nthey were doing some work, and\n\n83\n00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.590\ndidn't put up the standard,\nhey, here's the cones,\n\n84\n00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.460\ncaution, big hole in\nthe floor kind of thing.\n\n85\n00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.430\nAnd so they just, they didn't fence it off\nin any way and they just left it open.\n\n86\n00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.730\nI guess they probably thought, okay,\nI'm gonna run out, get something,\n\n87\n00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:05.550\ncome right back.\n\n88\n00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.230\nWho's gonna walk around and\nfall in the hole?\n\n89\n00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.650\nWell, that was a really dumb idea,\n\n90\n00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.710\nright, because clearly that's\nexactly what happened.\n\n91\n00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.293\nAnd so, it wasn't me otherwise I\nwouldn't be telling you this story.\n\n92\n00:04:14.293 --> 00:04:16.661\nAnd I can laugh about it now,\nthankful nobody got hurt.\n\n93\n00:04:16.661 --> 00:04:20.120\nBut one of the guys who was moving\none of the racks of equipment,\n\n94\n00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.102\nwas moving the rack, didn't realize\nthat there was literally this four\n\n95\n00:04:24.102 --> 00:04:26.581\nby four hole in the floor,\nand stepped off and\n\n96\n00:04:26.581 --> 00:04:30.840\nwound up, they're usually about two\nthree feet depending on where you are.\n\n97\n00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.068\nTwo, two and a half feet down\njust come did one of these and\n\n98\n00:04:33.068 --> 00:04:35.632\nliterally disappeared, right,\nand became half the man he was.\n\n99\n00:04:35.632 --> 00:04:36.504\n&gt;&gt; Yeah he did.\n\n100\n00:04:36.504 --> 00:04:40.139\n&gt;&gt; Thankfully, the rack didn't tip over,\nnothing happened cuz everybody around\n\n101\n00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.277\nunderstood what was\nhappening immediately and\n\n102\n00:04:42.277 --> 00:04:44.370\njumped in to prevent\nany significant damage.\n\n103\n00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.512\nYou can imagine if the rack had gone in\nthe hole with him, he would have been\n\n104\n00:04:47.512 --> 00:04:50.260\ncrushed and just obviously that\ncould have been catastrophic.\n\n105\n00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.450\nSo we joke around about some of this stuff\nsometimes just to explain it to you,\n\n106\n00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.060\nbut a significant liability that we\nwould have been looking at there,\n\n107\n00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.430\nhad this person, obviously,\nhurt themselves in any significant way.\n\n108\n00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.160\nSo determining who could be harmed and\nhow will be very important.\n\n109\n00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.600\nAnalyzing risk and checking to\nmake sure we have precautions, or\n\n110\n00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.950\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n111\n00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.720\nYou know, I love when I walk through\na Costco or whatever it may be, and\n\n112\n00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.200\nyou see there's a spill on the floor and\nthey have the spill cone.\n\n113\n00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.020\nYou know, they put it out,\n\n114\n00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.370\nthe big yellow kinda tent caution,\nwet floor, that kinda thing.\n\n115\n00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.680\nSo again I'm in the data center, right,\n\n116\n00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.740\nbut I'm in one of my customers'\ndata centers down in the Caribbean.\n\n117\n00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.710\nAnd [COUGH] culturally things are a little\ndifferent depending on where you go\n\n118\n00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:32.590\nin the world, right.\n\n119\n00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.710\nAnd so in this particular data center\nthey have a cleaning crew that\n\n120\n00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.130\ncomes through and\ncleans the entire office every day.\n\n121\n00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.980\nAnd they go into the data center and\nthey clean the data center,\n\n122\n00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.310\nwhich is not unusual.\n\n123\n00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.240\nBut one of the unusual things is\nthat floor in the data center,\n\n124\n00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.320\nportion of it anyway, kind of the ramps up\nand stuff, or poured concrete much like\n\n125\n00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.140\nwhat we have here in the studio,\nterrazzo concrete floor.\n\n126\n00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.260\nYou got the raised platform and\n\n127\n00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.670\nthe removable tiles but\nthe beginnings area is of it.\n\n128\n00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.510\nSo they come in every night and\nthey mop the concrete areas, right,\n\n129\n00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:03.920\njust wash them down.\n\n130\n00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.350\nSo they put out the hey, don't trip,\ndon't slip, wet floor kind of sign.\n\n131\n00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.450\nI actually took a picture of it,\nI have it somewhere.\n\n132\n00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.560\nBut you don't see that stuff in data\ncenters typically because you think about\n\n133\n00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.070\nit, you don't want water\nin the data center.\n\n134\n00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.820\nWhat if somebody knocks a bucket of\nwater over and fries all the equipment?\n\n135\n00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.980\nSo you got to think about all this\nstuff and how it plays out, right.\n\n136\n00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.920\nSo analyzing risks, checking for\nother precautions to make sure\n\n137\n00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.690\nwe have the appropriate issues and\nthings associated with that addressed.\n\n138\n00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.700\nImplement results of risk assessment.\n\n139\n00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.550\nFigure out what the category and\nthe cataloging of risk is and then move\n\n140\n00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.230\nto implement precautionary things that\nwill prevent that from happening.\n\n141\n00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:39.490\nAnd review the risk assessment.\n\n142\n00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:40.530\nWe talked a lot about this and\n\n143\n00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:44.110\ntalked about the fact that reviewing\nwhat we're doing in an ongoing basis\n\n144\n00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:48.260\nto ensure not only compliance but\nalso alignment and relevancy.\n\n145\n00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.330\nIt's gonna be very important for\n\n146\n00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.890\nus to be able to do those things and\nunderstand that what we're doing today is\n\n147\n00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:57.090\nstill relevant to address the risks that\nwe may have identified a year ago or more.\n\n148\n00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.490\nI have a couple customers that\nI went through this recently\n\n149\n00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.560\nwhere we did an assessment,\nkinda top to bottom, to get ready for\n\n150\n00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.750\nan audit of their controls and\nall their systems and things like that.\n\n151\n00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.580\nAnd we went through the BCDR plans and\nthe incident response plans,\n\n152\n00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:12.610\ndid kind of a top to bottom.\n\n153\n00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:16.190\nYou typically call this a pre-audit,\nright, in the audit language.\n\n154\n00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.730\nYou go in and do a pre-audit to\nget them ready for the audit.\n\n155\n00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:21.910\nIt's essentially an audit but\nit's not a formal audit.\n\n156\n00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.310\nAnd so, yeah,\nyou give them the unofficial findings.\n\n157\n00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.270\nHey these are areas you're\ngonna have to work on.\n\n158\n00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.809\nThis was good, you gotta fix this,\nit's the audit before the audit, right.\n\n159\n00:07:30.809 --> 00:07:31.318\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n160\n00:07:31.318 --> 00:07:32.708\n&gt;&gt; And so as a result,\n\n161\n00:07:32.708 --> 00:07:35.548\nthey tend to be much more successful\nwhen it comes to the real audit, and\n\n162\n00:07:35.548 --> 00:07:36.990\nit works well for everybody.\n\n163\n00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:41.190\nYou get twice the amount of business, they\nget to be successful, everybody's happy.\n\n164\n00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:45.700\nSo we did a pre-audit for them, and\nin doing it we went through and\n\n165\n00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.226\nI sit my clients down when\nI do this kind of work, and\n\n166\n00:07:49.226 --> 00:07:54.397\nI want to see the current configuration\nmanagement builds on the systems.\n\n167\n00:07:54.397 --> 00:07:55.746\nI want to see what they're doing.\n\n168\n00:07:55.746 --> 00:07:58.103\nI want to align that with process and\nprocedure.\n\n169\n00:07:58.103 --> 00:08:01.537\nAnd policy, and I wanna see if there's\nanything that they're not doing that they\n\n170\n00:08:01.537 --> 00:08:04.780\nshould be, but also stuff that they\nare doing that's no longer relevant.\n\n171\n00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.960\nBecause those are big\nred flags in an audit.\n\n172\n00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.540\nAnd we wanna get rid of\nthe documentation and the references and\n\n173\n00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.350\nthe process, procedure, policy stuff for\nstuff you're not doing anymore because\n\n174\n00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:17.015\nthat's getting in the way of\nthe stuff you should be doing.\n\n175\n00:08:17.015 --> 00:08:18.423\nAn auditor's gonna look at that and say,\n\n176\n00:08:18.423 --> 00:08:21.009\nwhy is all this stuff still on the books\nif you haven't done it in five years.\n\n177\n00:08:21.009 --> 00:08:23.100\nI mean, why are you doing it?\n\n178\n00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.553\nSo we went through, we found some\nstuff that they had recently retired,\n\n179\n00:08:25.553 --> 00:08:26.730\nthey're just not doing anymore.\n\n180\n00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:29.671\nWe said, okay, let's remove that and\nlet's just make sure you clean this up and\n\n181\n00:08:29.671 --> 00:08:30.920\neverything's fine.\n\n182\n00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.439\nBut we keep coming back to this.\n\n183\n00:08:32.439 --> 00:08:34.596\nAnd I mentioned this in\nsome prior episodes,\n\n184\n00:08:34.596 --> 00:08:37.012\nalthough not in this\nparticular topic area.\n\n185\n00:08:37.012 --> 00:08:39.907\nBut every so often, I'll see that\npeople still use fax machines.\n\n186\n00:08:39.907 --> 00:08:43.458\nAnd it's interesting because, at least in\nthe US and in many portions of the world,\n\n187\n00:08:43.458 --> 00:08:45.500\nfax machines are still very prevalent.\n\n188\n00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.690\nDo you know why we still have\nto use fax machines, by the way?\n\n189\n00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:50.528\n&gt;&gt; I'm guessing it has something to do\nwith land lines are more prevalent than\n\n190\n00:08:50.528 --> 00:08:51.394\nmaybe digital lines.\n\n191\n00:08:51.394 --> 00:08:53.580\n&gt;&gt; It's a good thought process.\n\n192\n00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.150\nIt's actually not the main driver,\nnot the main reason.\n\n193\n00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:57.840\nIt may be in certain areas,\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n194\n00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.360\nThat's probably a really good thought\nprocess in areas of the world where that\n\n195\n00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.720\nis still the case because you may\nhave a lot more older technology.\n\n196\n00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.130\nPerhaps the infrastructure's not as built\nout, and that certainly could be the case.\n\n197\n00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:10.940\nBut there's actually a legal reason why\nfax machines have to still be used,\n\n198\n00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.180\nbelieve it or not.\n\n199\n00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:15.078\nIt is considered to be\nthe only acceptable form for\n\n200\n00:09:15.078 --> 00:09:19.157\ndigitally transmitting your\nsignature under many country's laws.\n\n201\n00:09:19.157 --> 00:09:23.659\nBecause at the time that this technology\nwas introduced, if you think about 30,\n\n202\n00:09:23.659 --> 00:09:25.717\nprobably close to 40 years ago now,\n\n203\n00:09:25.717 --> 00:09:29.410\nwe didn't have scanners in\nthe traditional sense we have them now.\n\n204\n00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:31.950\nAlthough a fax machine\nwas essentially that.\n\n205\n00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:35.973\nAlthough we had photocopiers, they were\nnot considered to be able to be used to be\n\n206\n00:09:35.973 --> 00:09:39.419\ncreating a legally binding copy of\na contract with a signature on it.\n\n207\n00:09:39.419 --> 00:09:44.316\nThe fax machine was considered to be the\nonly mechanism that was defined as being\n\n208\n00:09:44.316 --> 00:09:45.047\nlegal, and\n\n209\n00:09:45.047 --> 00:09:49.840\nas a result was used and has been used\nhistorically and continues to be.\n\n210\n00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.600\nAnd the reason many companies can't get\nrid of fax services and fax machines is\n\n211\n00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.680\nif they have to transmit a document that's\nlegally binding and they have to send\n\n212\n00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:02.330\nan original but they can't send it quickly\nbecause of let's say post or whatever.\n\n213\n00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:03.380\nHas to go immediately.\n\n214\n00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.225\nIt's the only acceptable method to do so.\n\n215\n00:10:05.225 --> 00:10:08.220\nThey can't scan a PDF and\nemail it and have that be binding it,\n\n216\n00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.430\nit's not accepted.\n\n217\n00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:12.730\nWhich is just kinda fascinating in today's\nmodern world when you think about some of\n\n218\n00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:16.770\nthis stuff, how some of these legacy\nsystems still exist and no reasons why.\n\n219\n00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:19.950\nCuz every time I see a customer on\nthe fax train I ask the same question.\n\n220\n00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:20.760\nWhat's the purpose?\n\n221\n00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:21.920\nWhy do we still have it?\n\n222\n00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:26.050\nAnd I understand what the answer typically\nis, and I expect it, but every so\n\n223\n00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:28.220\noften you'll get answer that has\nnothing to do with that and I'm like,\n\n224\n00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.680\nokay, just so you understand,\nis it because of this?\n\n225\n00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.250\nAnd if it's this, we need to keep it.\n\n226\n00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:34.060\nIf it's not, let's get rid of it.\n\n227\n00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:35.760\nThere's better ways to deal with this,\nright?\n\n228\n00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.553\nBut it's usually a legally binding reason.\n\n229\n00:10:37.553 --> 00:10:38.448\nIt's kind of interesting.\n\n230\n00:10:38.448 --> 00:10:39.654\n&gt;&gt; It's very interesting.\n\n231\n00:10:39.654 --> 00:10:44.499\nIt leads you into a whole interesting\nidea of the fact that the legal\n\n232\n00:10:44.499 --> 00:10:49.730\nsystem is always a couple of steps\nbehind the technological systems.\n\n233\n00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:51.240\nThey're always ahead of them,\nthey're having to play catchup.\n\n234\n00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz if they leapfrog,\nyou think about it.\n\n235\n00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.768\nThey go into the modern day and\nsay okay, great.\n\n236\n00:10:56.768 --> 00:10:59.576\nWe'll use cloud services like DocuShare or\nDocuSign or whatever, and\n\n237\n00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:00.427\nwe'll accept that.\n\n238\n00:11:00.427 --> 00:11:03.960\nAnd a lot of companies do,\ndon't get me wrong, and they use that.\n\n239\n00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.232\nBut laws have not necessarily caught up\nwith that, and so if you wind up in court\n\n240\n00:11:08.232 --> 00:11:12.220\ndisputing a contract,\nthat contract may not be seen as binding.\n\n241\n00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:16.070\nBecause it was not presented in a way\nthat actually is gonna be binding.\n\n242\n00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:18.830\nI'm not saying that is or is not the case,\nI'm just pointing out that\n\n243\n00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:21.930\nthat may be a problem depending on what\ncountry you're in and what the law says.\n\n244\n00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:24.830\nSo it's kinda interesting,\nit's just an interesting little aside.\n\n245\n00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:28.680\nAnyway, back to the conversation at hand,\nwe're not here to talk about fax machines.\n\n246\n00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.793\nOn risk and risk analysis, so\nlet's talk a little bit more about risk.\n\n247\n00:11:31.793 --> 00:11:34.510\nWe talked about risk assessment,\nhow to do that in the workplace.\n\n248\n00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:36.410\nLet's talk about risk analysis, right?\n\n249\n00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:39.730\nThe idea of understanding risk, and\nputting it into the context and\n\n250\n00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:43.790\nthe environmental variables and primers\nwe operate in is also very important.\n\n251\n00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:44.570\nIdentifying risk and\n\n252\n00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:48.960\npotential losses that may result from them\nis really what risk analysis is all about.\n\n253\n00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.770\nWhen we think about risk analysis, we can\nframe this with regards to a formula.\n\n254\n00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:54.900\nWe have several of them we share with you.\n\n255\n00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.650\nCouple more coming up in\njust a couple of minutes.\n\n256\n00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.930\nBut risk analysis,\nwhat do we think of that as being?\n\n257\n00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.110\nTraditionally dramatic pause so\nI can actually catch my breath.\n\n258\n00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.940\nSo risk analysis.\n\n259\n00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:05.450\nWhat does that actually translate into?\n\n260\n00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:08.600\nWe would say this is made up\nof three constituent parts.\n\n261\n00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:12.820\nRisk assessment plus risk\nmanagement plus risk communication.\n\n262\n00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:16.480\nRisk assessment plus risk\nmanagement plus risk communication\n\n263\n00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.200\nequals risk analysis overall.\n\n264\n00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:18.800\nIn other words,\n\n265\n00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:22.355\nrisk analysis is made up of these\nthree component parts and elements.\n\n266\n00:12:22.355 --> 00:12:23.800\nWe wanna add them together and\n\n267\n00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.550\nunderstand how they are interacting in\norder to understand what risk analysis is.\n\n268\n00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:31.840\nAgain, keep in mind, this is not meant\nto represent a mathematical formula\n\n269\n00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.950\nthat you should think about trying\nto actually go out and execute on.\n\n270\n00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:39.160\nIn other words, we don't give\na numerical value to risk access.\n\n271\n00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:43.250\nWe don't give a numerical value or\na dollar value to risk management and say,\n\n272\n00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:47.080\nadd the two together and get seven,\nand that's what risk analysis equals.\n\n273\n00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.470\nThis is simply meant to represent,\nconceptually,\n\n274\n00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:54.800\nthe constituent parts that make up\nthe thought process of risk analysis,\n\n275\n00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.690\nnot that you should go out,\ntry to execute this formula.\n\n276\n00:12:57.690 --> 00:12:59.850\nCuz I get that every so\noften from a student, or\n\n277\n00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:03.820\nsomebody in class where they'll say,\nwell, how do I make that work?\n\n278\n00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:04.674\nShow me how I do that.\n\n279\n00:13:04.674 --> 00:13:08.140\nAnd it's not the mathematics,\nit's just the way we represent it.\n\n280\n00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.760\nSo I just want to be clear about that,\nright?\n\n281\n00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.580\nIt's not a numerical thing,\nit's a compartmentalized component thing.\n\n282\n00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:16.080\nWe're adding them together\nto equal the whole, and\n\n283\n00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.950\nthe whole activity is risk analysis.\n\n284\n00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:22.001\nSo risk assessment, understanding what\nrisks are, weighing them, valuing them,\n\n285\n00:13:22.001 --> 00:13:24.410\ncategorizing them, prioritizing them.\n\n286\n00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:26.430\nRisk management, the oversight and\n\n287\n00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:30.040\nthe governance and compliance\nactivities around risk activities.\n\n288\n00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:35.090\nAssessment, analysis and understanding\nhow to catalogue and categorize.\n\n289\n00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:37.928\nAnd risk communication,\nbroadly interpreting and\n\n290\n00:13:37.928 --> 00:13:42.441\nspending time making sure we are, in an\naudience relevant and audience aware way,\n\n291\n00:13:42.441 --> 00:13:44.712\nbroadly disseminating that knowledge.\n\n292\n00:13:44.712 --> 00:13:48.750\nThose three activities, or pillars,\nare what make up risk analysis overall.\n\n293\n00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:52.170\nSo wanna make sure we understand\nthe constituent parts of risk analysis,\n\n294\n00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:55.000\nhow it comes together, and\nwhy it is so important.\n\n295\n00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.565\nHelps us to identify and\nto understand the assets,\n\n296\n00:13:57.565 --> 00:13:59.840\nwhich are the resources\nof an organization.\n\n297\n00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.970\nWe've identified assets, and\ntalked about them before.\n\n298\n00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:06.560\nWhat the disruptive events are that\nare likely to threaten an organization,\n\n299\n00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.740\nso threats that we may face.\n\n300\n00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:09.900\nWhat are the vulnerabilities,\n\n301\n00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:13.820\nthe weaknesses that the organization\nmay have, that threat actors, right,\n\n302\n00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:16.490\ncan take advantage of,\nbad actors that look to do us harm?\n\n303\n00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:18.128\nThe losses we may entail or\n\n304\n00:14:18.128 --> 00:14:21.567\nhave thrust upon us as a result\nof risk being realized.\n\n305\n00:14:21.567 --> 00:14:24.786\nAnd the safeguards, the preventative\nmeasures we put in place to offset\n\n306\n00:14:24.786 --> 00:14:28.500\nthe vulnerabilities, commonly call\nthose countermeasures or controls.\n\n307\n00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:32.860\nAll of those together are gonna be part of\nwhat risk analysis helps us to identify\n\n308\n00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:33.730\nand to understand.\n\n309\n00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:36.372\nSo wanna make sure we\nare aware of those things and\n\n310\n00:14:36.372 --> 00:14:39.079\nhave a way really good in\nour mind of stabilizing,\n\n311\n00:14:39.079 --> 00:14:43.342\nthinking through the logic of, and\ncementing that information in our heads.\n\n312\n00:14:43.342 --> 00:14:48.740\nWhat are the two approaches, the two\ncommon approaches for risk analysis?\n\n313\n00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:49.550\nWe have two.\n\n314\n00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:52.610\nWe speak about quantitative\nand/or qualitative risk analysis.\n\n315\n00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:56.290\nWhen we think about quantitative risk\nanalysis, we think about a numbers-driven,\n\n316\n00:14:56.290 --> 00:15:01.130\nkind of hard value, dollars and cents,\nkind of approach, where we can assign and\n\n317\n00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:05.550\nascribe a either cost or\nvalue to everything we do and\n\n318\n00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:09.190\nthen weigh that against countermeasures\nand see whether it's a good or bad idea.\n\n319\n00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:12.730\nWe often say we want $5\nsolutions to $5,000 problems,\n\n320\n00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:15.414\nnot $5,000 solutions to $5 problems.\n\n321\n00:15:15.414 --> 00:15:19.340\nAnd the way we figure that out is\nthrough quantitative assessment.\n\n322\n00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:22.950\nSo quantitative assessment or\nanalysis is gonna be one approach.\n\n323\n00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:27.220\nAlso qualitative analysis,\nmore of a soft way at looking at things.\n\n324\n00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:30.100\nIt's not driven by numbers and\ndollars and cents.\n\n325\n00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:33.550\nBut rather it's more of\nan opinion-driven solution.\n\n326\n00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:36.933\nMore of a thought process than\nmaybe based on perception.\n\n327\n00:15:36.933 --> 00:15:41.250\nSo we're not gonna come up with\na $5,000 or $5 price tag for\n\n328\n00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:44.114\na control based on a qualitative analysis.\n\n329\n00:15:44.114 --> 00:15:49.427\nBut rather, we're gonna be able to\nunderstand the intangible thought process,\n\n330\n00:15:49.427 --> 00:15:52.278\nor intangibles associated with that risk.\n\n331\n00:15:52.278 --> 00:15:57.127\nSo it may be an impact to our Reputation\nor perception in the mind of a customer,\n\n332\n00:15:57.127 --> 00:16:01.620\nthat were way with a qualitative\nassessment or a qualitative analysis.\n\n333\n00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:06.408\nWhereas, when we think about quantitative\nassessment analysis, we're thinking about\n\n334\n00:16:06.408 --> 00:16:10.701\nthe impact financially in the dollars and\ncents associated with that activity.\n\n335\n00:16:10.701 --> 00:16:13.970\nSo, when we think about\nquantitative analysis.\n\n336\n00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:17.320\nWe're thinking about a formula that\nsome of you are probably familiar with.\n\n337\n00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:22.830\nYou've heard us talk about it in other\nareas, in CISSP, in CHFI, in CEH and\n\n338\n00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:27.700\nSSEP, in CCSP, ABC123,\nyou and me, do re mi.\n\n339\n00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:28.730\nHere we are, Dr.\n\n340\n00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:33.540\nSeuss Theodore Geisel displaying and\ndistributing for you risk analysis today.\n\n341\n00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:34.810\nI actually saw, random aside.\n\n342\n00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:36.520\nThis is our random aside by the way.\n\n343\n00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.602\nIn this conversation right now.\n\n344\n00:16:37.602 --> 00:16:38.320\n&gt;&gt; You beat me to it.\n\n345\n00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.361\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We have to come up\n\n346\n00:16:39.361 --> 00:16:41.550\nwith a better hand signal\nthan the time-out signal.\n\n347\n00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:44.770\nWe gotta do an R, I gotta figure how to\ndo an R, I don't know if I could do that,\n\n348\n00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:45.690\nbut anyway.\n\n349\n00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:46.890\nSo part of our random aside,\n\n350\n00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:51.560\nso I saw a really cool thing last night\non TV when I was just had some down time.\n\n351\n00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.490\nAnd, had to do with Dr Seuss, right?\n\n352\n00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:56.070\nSo,\n&gt;&gt; Was it about the pronunciation of\n\n353\n00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:56.588\nhis name?\n\n354\n00:16:56.588 --> 00:16:57.570\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, not that.\n\n355\n00:16:57.570 --> 00:16:59.790\n&gt;&gt; I saw something yesterday about\nthe pronunciation of his name.\n\n356\n00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:01.550\nHis name is actually pronounced Seuss.\n\n357\n00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:03.530\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; Dr. Seuss.\n\n358\n00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:05.350\n&gt;&gt; Dr. Seuss instead of Dr.,\nthat I did not know.\n\n359\n00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:06.220\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] We Americanized it, yeah.\n\n360\n00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:07.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n&gt;&gt; And, probably everybody in the world\n\n361\n00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:11.660\nhas grown up saying Dr. Seuss, I did not\nknow it was Dr. Seuss, so that was cool.\n\n362\n00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.950\nI did know that his real\nname is Theodore Geisel.\n\n363\n00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:16.440\nBut I did not know that he\ncalled himself Dr Seuss.\n\n364\n00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.140\nBut I learned a couple\nof new things about him,\n\n365\n00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:21.710\nnumber one, so interesting little factoid.\n\n366\n00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:25.340\nHis first book was denied by 22 publishers\nbefore someone finally published it.\n\n367\n00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:27.817\nHe published 40 books in his lifetime,\n\n368\n00:17:27.817 --> 00:17:30.240\nsold over half a billion, with a B\n&gt;&gt; Whoa.\n\n369\n00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:35.340\n&gt;&gt; Copies of his combined works and yet 22\npublishers said, you're out of your mind.\n\n370\n00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:36.050\nThis is never gonna work.\n\n371\n00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:38.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It just goes to show you, right?\n\n372\n00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.970\nNot everybody knows what\nthey're talking about.\n\n373\n00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:44.640\nBut in addition to that, he started out\nas an advertising person before, which is\n\n374\n00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:48.380\nfairly commonly well known, before he\nactually became the person that he wound\n\n375\n00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:53.110\nup being, which was to write these\nfabulous and this world famous books.\n\n376\n00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:55.950\nBut he also wrote under other pseudonyms,\nwhich I did not know.\n\n377\n00:17:55.950 --> 00:18:01.000\nNot just his Dr. Seuss slash Seuss, but\nrather there were like two other names.\n\n378\n00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.930\nI don't know what they were,\nthey talked about them and I've forgot.\n\n379\n00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:07.600\nBut he wrote, apparently, under other\npseudonyms as well, which I did not know.\n\n380\n00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:08.680\n[CROSSTALK] I was not aware of that.\n\n381\n00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.280\nSo, just kind of interesting,\nI love Dr. Seuss.\n\n382\n00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:12.540\nNow, I have to call him Dr. Seuss.\n\n383\n00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:13.309\nI love Dr. Seuss!\n\n384\n00:18:13.309 --> 00:18:14.810\nForget about it, I'll call him Dr.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n385\n00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:17.160\n&gt;&gt; But I love Dr.\nSeuss, so i did not know this.\n\n386\n00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:22.110\n&gt;&gt; We read how\nGrinch Stole Christmas last night.\n\n387\n00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:24.230\nI've got little ones.\n\n388\n00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:25.910\n&gt;&gt; I have the big ones.\n\n389\n00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:27.310\n&gt;&gt; Fox in Socks.\n\n390\n00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:30.190\nOr-\n&gt;&gt; Red Fish, Blue Fish,\n\n391\n00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:30.972\nOne Fish, Two Fish.\n\n392\n00:18:30.972 --> 00:18:31.931\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] That's a great one.\n\n393\n00:18:31.931 --> 00:18:34.180\n&gt;&gt; Right, just out of there,\nthey're so awesome.\n\n394\n00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:35.073\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, good stuff.\n\n395\n00:18:35.073 --> 00:18:37.401\n&gt;&gt; I mean, so many kids around\nthe world grew up reading that stuff.\n\n396\n00:18:37.401 --> 00:18:38.260\n&gt;&gt; We give it two thumbs up.\n\n397\n00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.550\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, two thumbs up, absolutely.\n\n398\n00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:44.310\nBut, let's get back to talking\nabout quantitative analysis.\n\n399\n00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:45.870\nSo, a formula here, right.\n\n400\n00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:48.860\nSo, the formula which a lot of you\nprobably know, depending of course,\n\n401\n00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:50.690\nwhat your background is,\nyou may have heard of this.\n\n402\n00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:54.730\nCertainly if you have any background with\nIT security, with project management\n\n403\n00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:57.730\ngenerically, you've probably have\nheard something along these lines.\n\n404\n00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:00.450\nBut we talk about ALE\nequals three times hour.\n\n405\n00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:03.720\nLet me define that for you,\nbreak that down, explain what that is.\n\n406\n00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:08.760\nI know in the notes where I have to spell\nthat for you but ALE, as in the stuff you\n\n407\n00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:14.370\ndrink after work which is always fun and\nexciting Annualized loss expectancy, ALE,\n\n408\n00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:19.930\nthe acronym,\nis made up of two constituent parts.\n\n409\n00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:27.890\nSLE, single loss expectancy, times ARO,\nannualized rate of occurrence.\n\n410\n00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:31.590\nSo, annualized loss expectancy is equal to\n\n411\n00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:34.880\nsingle loss expectancy times\nannual rate of occurrence.\n\n412\n00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.370\nSo, what do we learn from this.\n\n413\n00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:40.300\nWell, let's put some dollars and\ncents to this conversation.\n\n414\n00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:44.890\nSo, let's say that I have\nan annualized loss expectancy.\n\n415\n00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:47.850\nI'm looking at a year long or\ntwelve month long\n\n416\n00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:52.500\nperspective on how much this\npotential risk is going to cost me.\n\n417\n00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.250\nAnd that's what I'm trying to\nfigure out through analysis right.\n\n418\n00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:58.930\nSo, if I look at what it cost\na single time when a vert occurs, and\n\n419\n00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:03.510\nhow often I expect it to occur,\nI can come up with a longterm vision.\n\n420\n00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:06.930\nSo, if I say every activity,\nevery time the risk is realized,\n\n421\n00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:10.930\nevery breach costs me,\nlet's keep it simple, $100 right?\n\n422\n00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:12.010\nVery simple number.\n\n423\n00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:14.480\nSo, if it costs $100 every\ntime it happens, and\n\n424\n00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:20.100\nit happens once a month over a 12 month\ncycle, 12 times 100 equals $1200,\n\n425\n00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:24.690\nthat this potential risk is gonna\ncost me over the course of the year.\n\n426\n00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:27.660\nThat's how I would use the formula\nto come up with a value.\n\n427\n00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:31.130\nThe ALE, the annualized loss expectancy,\nis the all up value for\n\n428\n00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:35.960\nthe time period in dollars and cents\nthat this negative impact of the risk\n\n429\n00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.490\nIt's going to essentially\nhave to be addressed by.\n\n430\n00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:39.550\nRight?\nSo, this is what it's\n\n431\n00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:41.570\ngoing to cost me if it goes unchallenged.\n\n432\n00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:44.920\nNow, when I say we want $5,000 solutions,\n$5,000 problems.\n\n433\n00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.020\nWhat I was getting at is the fact\nthat we want to understand,\n\n434\n00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:53.820\nhow to come up with a counter measure of\ncontrol, that is less than or equal to\n\n435\n00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:59.670\nthe ale value in order to apply a control\nthat can minimize, mitigate the risk.\n\n436\n00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:04.740\nAnd, as a result, hopefully be less\nexpensive than the projected losses.\n\n437\n00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.450\nBut this is something people don't\noften realize and think about.\n\n438\n00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:10.630\nYou have to think about not just okay for\ntwelve months, $1,200.\n\n439\n00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:13.670\nIf I spend less than that I'm good,\nif I spend that I'm okay but\n\n440\n00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:16.160\nwhat if I spend more than that,\nam I still okay?\n\n441\n00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:19.060\nIt depends on how long I keep\nthat system in operation for.\n\n442\n00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:24.430\nThe actual self time or\nlife time of an IT system varies.\n\n443\n00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:27.139\nBut, we're talking about an average\ncomputer, average server,\n\n444\n00:21:27.139 --> 00:21:28.898\nit's probably three to five years on that,\n\n445\n00:21:28.898 --> 00:21:31.381\nat least that's the depreciation\ncycle more often than not.\n\n446\n00:21:31.381 --> 00:21:34.510\nAnd, usually systems are bought and\noperated for at least that long, right?\n\n447\n00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:38.320\nSo, it's not just hey, one year, but\nit may actually be times three for\n\n448\n00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.600\nit at the beginning of\nthat acquisition cycle.\n\n449\n00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.586\nWhich means it maybe $3600.\n\n450\n00:21:42.586 --> 00:21:46.650\nThe ALE, the annualized loss\nexpectancy of 1200 multiplied\n\n451\n00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:49.950\nby the number of years I may\nkeep that system online.\n\n452\n00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:55.655\nSo if it's 3 times 1200 or 3600, and\nnow I look at it and say, okay, if I spend\n\n453\n00:21:55.655 --> 00:22:00.700\n$1200 for a counter measure, I recoup\nthat after the first year of operation.\n\n454\n00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:04.970\nI'm essentially netting two years of\noperation by minimizing that loss.\n\n455\n00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:10.222\nI'm netting $2,400 on my $1,200\ninvestment against a $3,600 liability.\n\n456\n00:22:10.222 --> 00:22:12.770\nAnd as a result, it's actually\na really good countermeasure.\n\n457\n00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:16.510\nSo, I have to think about not just\nwhat it costs for one year, but\n\n458\n00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:18.340\nwhat it may cost for\nthe lifetime of that system.\n\n459\n00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:21.290\nNow, if you have a system that may go for\n15,\n\n460\n00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:23.900\n20 years, you obviously gotta\ndo the math and figure this out.\n\n461\n00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:28.020\nBut this is part of what understanding\nhow to do risk analysis implies.\n\n462\n00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.850\nWe've gotta look at the,\nnot just the immediacy and\n\n463\n00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:32.770\nthe horizon of the single year event.\n\n464\n00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:35.550\nBut rather, we have to factor\nin the lifetime of the system,\n\n465\n00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:39.410\nthe operational horizon of that\nsystem to understand it, truly and\n\n466\n00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:42.280\nunderstand how to weigh that or\nessentially assess that impact.\n\n467\n00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.680\nJust something to think about\nwith quantitative assessment.\n\n468\n00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:49.720\nWith qualitative analysis or assessment,\nI use those terms interchangeably\n\n469\n00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:54.440\nby the way, but with analysis, qualitative\nanalysis, soft values, tangible and\n\n470\n00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.640\nintangible, we're focusing on intangible.\n\n471\n00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:01.270\nRIsk can often be measured as\nbeing the following formula.\n\n472\n00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:06.030\nA tax success plus criticality, so\nput those together kinda in a bracket.\n\n473\n00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:08.470\nAdd those two together,\nminus counter measures,\n\n474\n00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.620\ncounter measure cost, leads to risk.\n\n475\n00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:13.240\nNow again, we're not really\nlooking at hard numbers and\n\n476\n00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.900\nwe're not looking at\na formula in this case.\n\n477\n00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:18.540\nAttack success plus criticality\nminus counter measure.\n\n478\n00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:20.630\nThat can be mathematically manipulated and\n\n479\n00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:24.360\ndrawn out the way that the quantitative\nanalysis formula can, right.\n\n480\n00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.710\nThis is more about intangibles,\n\n481\n00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:30.290\nmore about perception, opinion, and\nthe importance of those things.\n\n482\n00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:32.980\nWe may not have hard numbers to\nput into this particular formula,\n\n483\n00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:36.580\nbut what we're getting at is we have\nto understand what people think.\n\n484\n00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:38.140\nWas the attack successful?\n\n485\n00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.270\nOkay.\n\n486\n00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:40.370\nHow successful was it,\n\n487\n00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:43.894\nhow critical was it how much damage\nshould it do what the perception of that?\n\n488\n00:23:43.894 --> 00:23:47.741\nWhat are the counter measures that we\nhave in place are they perceived as being\n\n489\n00:23:47.741 --> 00:23:51.646\nimportant, and then we can access and\nanalyse whether on not that risk is still\n\n490\n00:23:51.646 --> 00:23:55.552\nsomething that is important for us to\naddress perhaps it has been minimized And\n\n491\n00:23:55.552 --> 00:23:58.007\nas a result,\nwe no longer need to worry about it.\n\n492\n00:23:58.007 --> 00:24:01.724\nSo we have to think about the fact that,\nwhen it comes to qualitative analysis,\n\n493\n00:24:01.724 --> 00:24:03.775\nwe're not gonna be looking at numbers, but\n\n494\n00:24:03.775 --> 00:24:07.310\nrather often dealing with people's\nopinions and perceptions.\n\n495\n00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:11.010\nAnd because of that, we don't see it\nas a mathematical formula per say.\n\n496\n00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:15.400\nBut we do see it as a way to represent the\nthought process of how we have to derive\n\n497\n00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.460\nrisk in order to understand it and\nanalyze it.\n\n498\n00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:18.630\nI don't want you to be trying\n\n499\n00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:19.580\nto fit numbers into-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n500\n00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:20.380\n&gt;&gt; Risk equals\n\n501\n00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:24.900\nattacks assess plus criticality minus\ncountermeasures and understand that may or\n\n502\n00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:26.640\nmay not be something that makes sense.\n\n503\n00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.686\nBut you certainly can fit\nnumbers into times arrow, and\n\n504\n00:24:29.686 --> 00:24:32.180\nmanipulate that formula mathematically,\nright?\n\n505\n00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:35.320\nTo understand a derived value\nat the end that does make sense.\n\n506\n00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:38.174\nYou can hold it in your hand and\nassess and weigh against, so we have both.\n\n507\n00:24:38.174 --> 00:24:41.981\nWe wanna understand that both are\nimportant to our overall analysis of risk.\n\n508\n00:24:41.981 --> 00:24:42.962\nIt's very important for\n\n509\n00:24:42.962 --> 00:24:46.340\nus to be able to derive the understanding\non both sides of the equation.\n\n510\n00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:49.382\nWhat are the four accepted strategies for\naddressing risk?\n\n511\n00:24:49.382 --> 00:24:51.187\nWhat do you think those are gonna be?\n\n512\n00:24:51.187 --> 00:24:54.520\nAnd we often talk about these, and again,\nyou may have some background with this.\n\n513\n00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.880\nYou may already be saying to yourself,\nwell, I know what those are.\n\n514\n00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:57.999\nThere are one, two, three, four.\n\n515\n00:24:57.999 --> 00:24:59.660\nAnd you're gonna fill in\nthe blanks no problem.\n\n516\n00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:03.712\nBut if you're not familiar with them,\nthen we're not gonna tell you.\n\n517\n00:25:03.712 --> 00:25:04.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We are gonna tell you.\n\n518\n00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:05.420\n&gt;&gt; It's our secret.\n\n519\n00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:08.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're gonna keep it secret\nbecause you have not earned the right to\n\n520\n00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:09.090\nunderstand this knowledge.\n\n521\n00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:10.074\nNo, we are gonna tell you.\n\n522\n00:25:10.074 --> 00:25:10.640\nWe're gonna tell you right now.\n\n523\n00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:15.070\nBut before I do that, I just wanna point\nout that, again, cross pollination\n\n524\n00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:18.530\nacross different disciplines is so\ncritical to what we do to be successful.\n\n525\n00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:21.890\nA lot of our thought processes come\nto us from project management.\n\n526\n00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:26.206\nCome to us from frameworks like ITill,\nlike COBIT, like VAL IT,\n\n527\n00:25:26.206 --> 00:25:30.677\nlike MOR, measurement of risk, and\nall these other frameworks and\n\n528\n00:25:30.677 --> 00:25:33.670\nthought processes we can\napply to what we do.\n\n529\n00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:35.030\nAnd you may or may not know some of these.\n\n530\n00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:36.485\nYou may or may not have heard of them.\n\n531\n00:25:36.485 --> 00:25:37.958\nYou may not understand them,\nand that's okay.\n\n532\n00:25:37.958 --> 00:25:39.560\nThere's nothing wrong with that.\n\n533\n00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:43.310\nBut when we think about these, we\nunderstand that these kinds of activities,\n\n534\n00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:45.150\nthe ones I'm about to discuss with you,\n\n535\n00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:47.990\nthe strategies for addressing risk,\ncome to us from more than one place.\n\n536\n00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:50.940\nAnd they're common to many disciplines and\nthought processes.\n\n537\n00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:53.380\nAnd as a result,\nthey are best practices, and\n\n538\n00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:56.560\nwe encourage you to think about them and\nfollow them as such.\n\n539\n00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.720\nKnow them if asked about them,\ncertainly, but\n\n540\n00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.900\nalso understand how to apply\nthem in the real world.\n\n541\n00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:03.640\nIn no particular order,\nno prioritized ranking,\n\n542\n00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.970\nsimply just walking down the list, right?\n\n543\n00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:08.170\nWe have the ability to avoid risk.\n\n544\n00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:10.070\nWe have the ability to accept risk.\n\n545\n00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:13.590\nWe have the ability to mitigate,\nmitigate means minimize, minimize risk.\n\n546\n00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:17.130\nAnd the ability to transfer risk,\nright, in one form or another.\n\n547\n00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:20.120\nSo when we think about the four\nstrategies, we can avoid risk.\n\n548\n00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.665\nJust simply say, I'm not gonna\nengage in that kind of activity,\n\n549\n00:26:22.665 --> 00:26:24.391\nnot going to engage in\nthat kinda behavior.\n\n550\n00:26:24.391 --> 00:26:25.767\nNot gonna do it, right?\n\n551\n00:26:25.767 --> 00:26:27.210\nJust not gonna do it, right?\n\n552\n00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:27.786\n&gt;&gt; Not gonna do it.\n\n553\n00:26:27.786 --> 00:26:28.464\n&gt;&gt; Not gonna do it, exactly.\n\n554\n00:26:28.464 --> 00:26:29.759\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can't do the accent.\n\n555\n00:26:29.759 --> 00:26:32.090\nBut that's what I was going after,\nnot gonna do it.\n\n556\n00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:33.130\nAcceptance, right?\n\n557\n00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:35.130\nWe're going to accept risk.\n\n558\n00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:37.710\nOften you hear people say, well,\nit's the price of doing business, right?\n\n559\n00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:38.450\nI'm just gonna do that.\n\n560\n00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:41.660\nThat's just kinda what we gotta do,\nthat's acceptance of risk.\n\n561\n00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:43.396\nMitigation can minimize risk.\n\n562\n00:26:43.396 --> 00:26:47.080\nI can engage in activities\nthat will make it less likely\n\n563\n00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:48.510\nthat that risk is going to occur.\n\n564\n00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:52.070\nAnd if it does occur,\nthat it's less likely or\n\n565\n00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:55.080\nvery unlikely they it will\ncause us significant harm.\n\n566\n00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:57.360\nSo as a result,\nI may put countermeasures in place,\n\n567\n00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.730\nwhich is often what mitigation is about.\n\n568\n00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:02.470\nCountermeasures and\ncontrols will get deployed\n\n569\n00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:05.980\nthat can minimize the impact of\nrisk should the risk still occur.\n\n570\n00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:07.505\nSo I use the classic example,\n\n571\n00:27:07.505 --> 00:27:10.259\nbecause I live in the southeast\nof the United States.\n\n572\n00:27:10.259 --> 00:27:13.596\nAnd six months out of the year, we have\nlovely weather events called hurricanes.\n\n573\n00:27:13.596 --> 00:27:15.319\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; May be familiar with them depending on\n\n574\n00:27:15.319 --> 00:27:15.958\nwhere you live.\n\n575\n00:27:15.958 --> 00:27:18.176\nWe have the equivalent of\nthem all over the world.\n\n576\n00:27:18.176 --> 00:27:21.797\nWe typhoons, and cyclones, and all sorts\nof stuff that are gonna be named for\n\n577\n00:27:21.797 --> 00:27:22.925\nthese kinds of storms.\n\n578\n00:27:22.925 --> 00:27:25.142\nNor'easters up in the northeast,\nsame idea.\n\n579\n00:27:25.142 --> 00:27:25.910\nI think our name is the coolest,\n\n580\n00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:26.585\nthe hurricane's-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, hurricane.\n\n581\n00:27:26.585 --> 00:27:27.669\n&gt;&gt; The coolest, rIght?\n\n582\n00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:30.973\nBut, if you live with this kind of\nweather event certain times a year,\n\n583\n00:27:30.973 --> 00:27:32.716\nyou know that you have to go outside.\n\n584\n00:27:32.716 --> 00:27:35.441\nYou have to take all the stuff that could\nblow around on the yard in if there's\n\n585\n00:27:35.441 --> 00:27:36.049\na storm coming.\n\n586\n00:27:36.049 --> 00:27:38.481\nYou have to put up shutters\nto protect the windows.\n\n587\n00:27:38.481 --> 00:27:40.424\nAll the kind of stuff you\nhave to do to minimize or\n\n588\n00:27:40.424 --> 00:27:43.449\nmitigate the potential liability\nassociated with the risk of the storm.\n\n589\n00:27:43.449 --> 00:27:44.986\nRight, so that's the kind of stuff we do.\n\n590\n00:27:44.986 --> 00:27:48.361\nTransference or transferring of\nrisk is essentially giving the risk\n\n591\n00:27:48.361 --> 00:27:51.830\nto somebody else in exchange for\nsomething, typically money.\n\n592\n00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:53.996\nClassic examples are insurance.\n\n593\n00:27:53.996 --> 00:27:56.630\nYou buy insurance, transferring risk.\n\n594\n00:27:56.630 --> 00:28:00.021\nCloud services and essentially\noutsourcing, your ability to manage your\n\n595\n00:28:00.021 --> 00:28:03.080\ninfrastructure by paying\nsomebody to do it on your behalf.\n\n596\n00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:06.670\nAnother classic example of transference\nwith regards to risk management and\n\n597\n00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:07.724\nmitigation, right?\n\n598\n00:28:07.724 --> 00:28:10.711\nI mean, you could view that potentially\neither way as a mitigation or\n\n599\n00:28:10.711 --> 00:28:11.750\na transference event.\n\n600\n00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:15.563\nBut we tend to classify cloud services as\ntransference events because essentially\n\n601\n00:28:15.563 --> 00:28:19.326\nyou're handing off infrastructure to\nsomebody else, asking them to manage it.\n\n602\n00:28:19.326 --> 00:28:22.470\nAnd you're paying them on\nbehalf of the business.\n\n603\n00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:24.261\nSo it's a transference of risk.\n\n604\n00:28:24.261 --> 00:28:25.690\nThey're taking on the liability.\n\n605\n00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:29.420\nSo make sure we understand the strategies\nassociated with risk management.\n\n606\n00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:31.230\nAlso wanna talk about\ncost benefit analysis.\n\n607\n00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:33.760\nI mentioned it quickly before,\nbut the understanding of\n\n608\n00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:37.880\nthe value of that countermeasure and\nmeasuring ROI, the return on investment.\n\n609\n00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:42.400\nTo understand what we're getting back with\nregards to the investments we make around\n\n610\n00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:45.570\nthe ability to validate controls and\ncountermeasures and the minimization or\n\n611\n00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:46.790\nmitigation activities.\n\n612\n00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:48.738\nImportant for\nus to engage in those behaviors.\n\n613\n00:28:48.738 --> 00:28:52.450\nWe also wanna think about the ability\nto measure residual risk, right?\n\n614\n00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:55.737\nI've mentioned before that there is\nalways risk left over in any system,\n\n615\n00:28:55.737 --> 00:28:56.700\nno matter what we do.\n\n616\n00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:00.520\nWanna understand that there's no\nsuch thing as a zero risk solution.\n\n617\n00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:04.520\nWe strive for that, it's that golden light\nat the end of the tunnel that we always\n\n618\n00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:05.960\nmove towards, but\nwe never quite get there.\n\n619\n00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:09.159\nBecause there's always unknown quantities,\nalways unknown risk, or\n\n620\n00:29:09.159 --> 00:29:11.550\nrisk that goes unmitigated or\nunchallenged.\n\n621\n00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:13.780\nAnd as a result,\nis always inherent in the system.\n\n622\n00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:16.080\nSo wanna think about that.\n\n623\n00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:19.422\nAgain, we could frame that\nusing a formula of a type.\n\n624\n00:29:19.422 --> 00:29:22.806\nBut you could say residual risk is\nessentially equal to inherent risk\n\n625\n00:29:22.806 --> 00:29:24.735\nmultiplied by the control risk.\n\n626\n00:29:24.735 --> 00:29:27.740\nAn inherent risk will be defined\nas stretch times vulnerability.\n\n627\n00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:32.334\nBut the reality is, again, it's very hard\nto put numbers to that and say, okay, so\n\n628\n00:29:32.334 --> 00:29:34.751\nas a result my residual risk is two,\nright?\n\n629\n00:29:34.751 --> 00:29:35.281\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n630\n00:29:35.281 --> 00:29:36.839\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or if you remember Back to School,\n\n631\n00:29:36.839 --> 00:29:40.063\nat the end where Rodney Dangerfield's\ncharacter's sitting there doing\n\n632\n00:29:40.063 --> 00:29:40.740\nall the exams.\n\n633\n00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:43.296\nWhere he's getting that grilling,\njust that huge grilling.\n\n634\n00:29:43.296 --> 00:29:46.983\nAnd the Sam Kinison character screaming\nat him, going, just answer the question.\n\n635\n00:29:46.983 --> 00:29:48.165\nAnd he says, four?\n\n636\n00:29:48.165 --> 00:29:50.741\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that's the answer, right?\n\n637\n00:29:50.741 --> 00:29:52.296\nSo it's one of those things, right?\n\n638\n00:29:52.296 --> 00:29:53.723\nI mean, it's not like that.\n\n639\n00:29:53.723 --> 00:29:56.072\nIt's not that epiphany moment where\nthe number pops in your head, and you go,\n\n640\n00:29:56.072 --> 00:29:57.070\nokay, that's it.\n\n641\n00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:58.910\nThis formula, again,\nis really just meant for\n\n642\n00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:02.260\nyou to frame the conversation\naround the moving parts and\n\n643\n00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:07.180\nunderstand how risk is going to be\nessentially constituted, right?\n\n644\n00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:09.280\nWhat makes up, what are the moving parts?\n\n645\n00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:11.270\nWhat are the things we have\nunderstand that make up risk?\n\n646\n00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:13.781\nInherent risk times the controls we apply,\nand\n\n647\n00:30:13.781 --> 00:30:18.170\ninherent risk being essentially\na summation of threats and vulnerability.\n\n648\n00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:21.600\nIs meaning for us to look at our\nlandscape and assess it and say,\n\n649\n00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.756\nhave we accounted for all the threats?\n\n650\n00:30:23.756 --> 00:30:25.440\nDo we understand all the vulnerabilities?\n\n651\n00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:29.600\nIf we have those things and we have\ncontrols that are supposed to offset them,\n\n652\n00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.580\nhow good of a job are we doing there?\n\n653\n00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:34.167\nAnd if we're offsetting all of\nthe risks we've identified,\n\n654\n00:30:34.167 --> 00:30:36.520\nand we have controls in place,\nand they are equitable.\n\n655\n00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:38.374\nWe've done a quantitative analysis and\n\n656\n00:30:38.374 --> 00:30:42.138\nunderstand the value of those controls is\npositive, then maybe we're on the road\n\n657\n00:30:42.138 --> 00:30:45.190\ntowards understanding how to\ndeal with risk the right way.\n\n658\n00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:47.875\nBut we have to then understand\nthat there's always residual risk.\n\n659\n00:30:47.875 --> 00:30:52.248\nThat there are gonna be either threats in\nvulnerabilities that have not been clearly\n\n660\n00:30:52.248 --> 00:30:56.500\nidentified, or have been but are not being\nmitigated properly cuz the controls in\n\n661\n00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.550\nplace are not functioning correctly.\n\n662\n00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:01.120\nAnd that's what this formula,\nquote unquote,\n\n663\n00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.850\nis supposed to help us to understand and\npotentially point us to.\n\n664\n00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:05.496\nSo just to understand that, right?\n\n665\n00:31:05.496 --> 00:31:08.712\nIf we don't reduce risk to the acceptable\nlevel, we have to step back and\n\n666\n00:31:08.712 --> 00:31:10.780\ngo back and iterate through this again.\n\n667\n00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:14.890\nAnd understand that there may be\nmore than one bite at the apple or\n\n668\n00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:17.660\ntime around the wheel that we\nhave to take to get it right.\n\n669\n00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:20.010\nNot every control is\napplied the right way.\n\n670\n00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:22.760\nNot every risk is mitigated\nthe right way the first time.\n\n671\n00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.430\nYou may have to do it more\nthan once to get it right, and\n\n672\n00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:26.620\nyou gotta think about that and\nbe aware of that.\n\n673\n00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:30.560\nAnd finally, with regards to risk and\nrisk analysis, risk assessment, and\n\n674\n00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:33.590\nall the things we talked about, wanna\nagain reference NIST here for a minute.\n\n675\n00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:36.060\nThe NIST approach to controls,\nimplementation.\n\n676\n00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.120\nHow do we implement controls?\n\n677\n00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:39.070\nTalked a lot about controls and\ntheir value.\n\n678\n00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:43.183\nTalked about assessing them, analyzing\nthem, understanding if the ROI is there\n\n679\n00:31:43.183 --> 00:31:46.640\nthrough cost benefit analysis and\nquantitative risk analysis.\n\n680\n00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.021\nBut how do we actually implement them?\n\n681\n00:31:48.021 --> 00:31:48.840\nWhat do we do?\n\n682\n00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.600\nSeven step process, right?\n\n683\n00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:51.709\nSeven step process.\n\n684\n00:31:51.709 --> 00:31:53.183\nWanna go through here real quickly.\n\n685\n00:31:53.183 --> 00:31:57.922\nWanna prioritize our actions, want to\nevaluate recommended control options,\n\n686\n00:31:57.922 --> 00:32:01.278\nunderstanding that there may\nbe more than one solution.\n\n687\n00:32:01.278 --> 00:32:02.504\nGotta figure out what the best one is.\n\n688\n00:32:02.504 --> 00:32:06.106\nMost cost effective, most relevant,\nmost functional, most appropriate for\n\n689\n00:32:06.106 --> 00:32:07.435\nthe organization.\n\n690\n00:32:07.435 --> 00:32:10.250\nGotta conduct the cost benefit\nanalysis as we talked about.\n\n691\n00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:12.630\nSelect the appropriate\ncontroller controls.\n\n692\n00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:14.640\nAssign responsibility for them.\n\n693\n00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:18.294\nNothing worse than saying I found\nthe perfect control, it's cost effective,\n\n694\n00:32:18.294 --> 00:32:19.240\nwe can do it.\n\n695\n00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:21.829\nAnd then nobody goes ahead and takes\nresponsibility for it and gets it done.\n\n696\n00:32:21.829 --> 00:32:26.020\nAnd then we get hit by the exact threat or\nrisk that we were talking about.\n\n697\n00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:28.450\nEverybody stands around afterwards going,\nokay whose fault was it?\n\n698\n00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:28.990\nWell, I don't know.\n\n699\n00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:29.663\nI didn't do that.\n\n700\n00:32:29.663 --> 00:32:30.904\nIt wasn't me, right?\n\n701\n00:32:30.904 --> 00:32:33.740\nI'm not the one that had that whole issue,\nright?\n\n702\n00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:35.082\nSo I mean, that's what we gotta do.\n\n703\n00:32:35.082 --> 00:32:37.112\nYou don't wanna look at each\nother after the fact and say,\n\n704\n00:32:37.112 --> 00:32:38.550\nI thought you did it, right?\n\n705\n00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:39.730\nThat's never a good conversation.\n\n706\n00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:43.780\n&gt;&gt; I like doing the whole\n[LAUGH] it was that guy.\n\n707\n00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:46.250\n&gt;&gt; Assign responsibility,\nvery important right?\n\n708\n00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:48.640\nSo put Daniel's name on the line\nnext hour whenever we come up.\n\n709\n00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:51.635\nBut that, develop a safeguard and\nlimitation plan, right?\n\n710\n00:32:51.635 --> 00:32:54.864\nSo have that not just responsibility line,\nbut actually the plan that says Daniel is\n\n711\n00:32:54.864 --> 00:32:57.760\ngonna do it, and by the way,\nthis is what Daniel's gonna do.\n\n712\n00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.210\nAnd make sure that Daniel does it.\n\n713\n00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:03.000\nThen implement the selected controls,\nactually do what we said we're gonna do.\n\n714\n00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.820\nAnd although it's not a step\nI'll add an eighth step, but\n\n715\n00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:09.250\nlet's be clear, this is Adam adding it,\nnot NIST saying it.\n\n716\n00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:12.150\nGo back and spot check in order to\nmake sure through verification and\n\n717\n00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:14.020\nvalidation that it's being done.\n\n718\n00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:17.330\nWe often say inspect what you expect,\nright?\n\n719\n00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:18.650\nTrust but verify.\n\n720\n00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:21.950\nI would say that in Russian, but\nnot everybody would understand it.\n\n721\n00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:26.410\nBut the idea is that,\nyou gotta understand, you gotta know\n\n722\n00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:29.360\nthat what people say they're gonna do,\ndespite their best efforts, and\n\n723\n00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:33.420\ndespite their trustworthiness, doesn't\nalways get done for a variety of reasons.\n\n724\n00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:38.383\nAnd if you learn nothing else from all of\nour time together, learn to be skeptical.\n\n725\n00:33:38.383 --> 00:33:42.183\nAll right, it's one of the most important\ntools you put in your toolbox as\n\n726\n00:33:42.183 --> 00:33:46.470\na security practitioner, as an IT\nprofessional, as an incident handler.\n\n727\n00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:47.880\nQuestion everything around you.\n\n728\n00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:52.370\nNot because you want to be that person\nwho is just never ever satisfied.\n\n729\n00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:53.550\nQuite the opposite.\n\n730\n00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:56.360\nI'm more than willing to accept\na logical explanation if\n\n731\n00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.200\nsomebody offers me one that's plausible.\n\n732\n00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:01.060\nBut I want to see proof of it before\nI'm willing to put it down on paper and\n\n733\n00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:03.310\nsign my name next to it and\nsay I believe, right?\n\n734\n00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:07.330\nBecause if you can't convince me, then\nit's just unlikely that it's occurring\n\n735\n00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:10.250\nthat way, not because I'm\nthe idiot who says no no no,\n\n736\n00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:13.040\nbut rather I'm the skeptical person\nthat wants you to show it to me.\n\n737\n00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:17.720\nAnd that's what the mentality, the thought\nprocess of risk analysis, risk assessment,\n\n738\n00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:20.450\nrisk management needs to be,\ntrust but verify.\n\n739\n00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:24.284\nIf I can validate what you're doing and\nI can show that it's being done, there's\n\n740\n00:34:24.284 --> 00:34:28.361\nan audit and verification, validation and\ntranscription trail that we I can look at.\n\n741\n00:34:28.361 --> 00:34:31.131\nI have proof beyond reasonable\ndoubt that we're doing everything\n\n742\n00:34:31.131 --> 00:34:32.420\nwe can to minimize risk.\n\n743\n00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:35.840\nAnd that's what we need to have, and\nthat's where we need to find ourselves\n\n744\n00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:39.190\nat the end of our conversations around\nrisk with regards to incident handling.\n\n745\n00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:42.380\n&gt;&gt; He who is most paranoid wins this game,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n746\n00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:43.872\nAt least in riskful ways.\n\n747\n00:34:43.872 --> 00:34:45.437\n[LAUGH] That being said, Adam,\n\n748\n00:34:45.437 --> 00:34:49.360\nI know you got a couple other things we\nwant to talk about when it comes to risk.\n\n749\n00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:50.020\n&gt;&gt; Cool little demo.\n\n750\n00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:50.900\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; We'll take a look at\n\n751\n00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:52.240\nsome risk management software.\n\n752\n00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:55.090\n&gt;&gt; How we can actually start quantifying,\n\n753\n00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:58.060\nworking with risk, do some risk analysis,\nthat kind of stuff.\n\n754\n00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:00.110\nLooking forward to that,\nhopefully you are as well.\n\n755\n00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:03.150\nBut we are out of time for this episode,\nso thank you for joining us.\n\n756\n00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:07.530\nBut signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n757\n00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:08.442\n&gt;&gt; I'm skeptical.\n\n758\n00:35:08.442 --> 00:35:12.554\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And we'll see you next time.\n\n759\n00:35:12.554 --> 00:35:18.557\n[MUSIC]\n\n760\n00:35:18.557 --> 00:35:20.525\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.297\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.297 --> 00:00:12.149\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.149 --> 00:00:13.669\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n6\n00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:16.880\nAnd welcome to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.110\nI'm your host Daniel Lawrie.\n\n8\n00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.370\nAnd in today's episode we are back\nwith more on our ECIH series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.660\nAnd of course,\njoining us back in the studio again,\n\n10\n00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.170\nfinishing up our conversation on risk,\nour good friend Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.790\nAdam, welcome back sir and,\nwhat are we going to learn today?\n\n12\n00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.740\n&gt;&gt; You know today, today,\nwhat should we do today?\n\n13\n00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.760\nI am thinking that today,\nright here, right now, today,\n\n14\n00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.770\nthat we should learn about,\nlet's take a look we should learn about.\n\n15\n00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.040\nOne more time you can do it.\n\n16\n00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.620\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n17\n00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.850\nThis is live boys and girls.\n\n18\n00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.280\n&gt;&gt; Your magic finger\nis a little off there.\n\n19\n00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.620\n&gt;&gt; It's just a little rusty.\n\n20\n00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.330\nI haven't been using it\nhas often I need to.\n\n21\n00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.800\nTheir's not as much charge\nin that finger right now.\n\n22\n00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.270\nWe're going to learn about and actually\ndo a little demo for you, building on\n\n23\n00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.320\nthe conversation we had the last time in\nthe last episode around wrapping up risk.\n\n24\n00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.210\nWe've done three episodes around risk.\n\n25\n00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.020\nReally, hopefully, done a pretty good and\nthorough job of discussing with you.\n\n26\n00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.490\nThought it would be a good\nidea to demonstrate for\n\n27\n00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.350\nyou what a typical risk assessment,\nrisk management tool may look like.\n\n28\n00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.400\nWhat do individuals that do incident\nresponse, security professionals,\n\n29\n00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.180\nIT professionals that do this for\n\n30\n00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.370\na living, what kind of tools\ndo they have in their toolbox?\n\n31\n00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.400\nWhat do they look like and as a result,\nwhat are some of the things we can expect\n\n32\n00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.460\nto see if we go out and\nview this for real?\n\n33\n00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.160\nSo we are going to take a look at this\nsoftware called pillar, pillar/ear or\n\n34\n00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.780\near/pillar depending on how\nyou choose to frame it.\n\n35\n00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.530\nYou'll see ear environment for\nthe analysis of risk.\n\n36\n00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.980\nPillar, risk analysis and management tool.\n\n37\n00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.100\nyou can download this tool and\ndemo it for free.\n\n38\n00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.580\nYou do have to get a license.\n\n39\n00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.640\nYou can follow the website\ninformation on how to get a license,\n\n40\n00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.790\nwe'll provide you the URL to do that.\n\n41\n00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.810\nVery straightforward, very easy to\ninstall and work with, very simple.\n\n42\n00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.650\nYou'll get this little window in the back\nwhen you launch it, just tells you more or\n\n43\n00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.850\nless what's going on with it.\n\n44\n00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.370\nYou could ignore that for\nthe most part, no big deal.\n\n45\n00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.776\nGot our little starting\nscreen here with our license.\n\n46\n00:02:03.776 --> 00:02:05.810\nWe are going to go ahead and\nclick on that and\n\n47\n00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.620\nonce we do we get the launch window\nhere and you'll see that we can go in,\n\n48\n00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.890\nI have applied my eval license, so\nyou could see it's sitting right there.\n\n49\n00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.100\nAnd then I have risk analysis and\nmanagement.\n\n50\n00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.440\nI could do quantitative excuse me or\nqualitative so\n\n51\n00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.960\nwe've talked about\nthe difference between the two.\n\n52\n00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.910\nWe'll take a look at those.\n\n53\n00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.090\nI could also engage in\nbusiness impact analysis BIA.\n\n54\n00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.100\nAnd this is continuity management,\nBCM planning as well.\n\n55\n00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.680\nAnd I could do qualitative or\nquantitative analysis around those.\n\n56\n00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.810\nSo I've got a pretty robust set of tool\nrelated items that I can interact with.\n\n57\n00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.040\nLet's take a look at\nquantitative analysis on risk.\n\n58\n00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.530\nTake a look here, we'll load this up.\n\n59\n00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.170\nGo into Project.\n\n60\n00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.870\nAnd I've already opened up, and\n\n61\n00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.190\nI'm using the sample data\nthat is loaded with the tool.\n\n62\n00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.670\nIt's example_en.mgr.\n\n63\n00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.470\nSo I've just gone in and found that file.\n\n64\n00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.770\nIt's going to reload it, so\nI'm just going to bring it back up.\n\n65\n00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.190\nAnd it says that I have some security\nprofiles that I may want to keep or\n\n66\n00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.550\ndiscard from a prior session.\n\n67\n00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:02.750\nI'm just going to keep them.\n\n68\n00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.390\nAnd you may see these prompts when\nyou use the tool, no big deal.\n\n69\n00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.030\nJust hit retain,\nyou'll see a couple of them there and\n\n70\n00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.820\nyou'll see it just does some stuff\nin the background, sets up and\n\n71\n00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.370\ngives us a summary of\nwhat's happening there.\n\n72\n00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.100\nWe'll click okay, and then it loads as\na tool let's just make that full screen,\n\n73\n00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.120\na little bit easier to interact with.\n\n74\n00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.200\nAnd the tool right now is set to\nrestricted it's got a red bar across\n\n75\n00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.420\nthe top this is the appropriate, or rather\nthe level that we are using the tool at.\n\n76\n00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.516\nRed equals expert,\nI can go into basic or medium.\n\n77\n00:03:30.516 --> 00:03:33.680\nWe're just going to use basic and\nset it to green just so\n\n78\n00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.700\nthat way we can interact with some of\nthe basic information and do a demo.\n\n79\n00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.110\nObviously, if you know more about\nthe tool, you use it on a regular basis,\n\n80\n00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.300\nyou would use it at an expert level, but\nthat gets a little more involved and\n\n81\n00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.050\nwe're not going to go\nthrough all the features.\n\n82\n00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:51.180\nSo when we're doing a quantitative\nanalysis, where we start out is,\n\n83\n00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.550\nas we always do with everything,\nwe click on project data.\n\n84\n00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.630\nAnd you'll see that we have information\nabout our project file here.\n\n85\n00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.020\nIf we were creating a brand new\nfile we would give it a name.\n\n86\n00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.460\nWe'd specify it here.\n\n87\n00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.340\nWe'd specify the project classification,\nrestricted or whatever it may be.\n\n88\n00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.560\nAnd we'd open that up,\nyou know top secret, secret, confidential.\n\n89\n00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.400\nThis is the categorization.\n\n90\n00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.780\nAnd classification conversation\nwe've had and prior discussions,\n\n91\n00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.470\nwe will come up with our own\nclassification and then apply it here.\n\n92\n00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.650\nOurs by default in the demo add\nto set to restrict it, right?\n\n93\n00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.590\nSo you put in what you want there.\n\n94\n00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.060\nGive it a description,\ndate of operation all that kind of stuff.\n\n95\n00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.960\nAnd once we're done with all\nthat we would save that.\n\n96\n00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.799\nWe would then go in and\ntake a look at the security domains.\n\n97\n00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.890\nThe security domains here.\n\n98\n00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.180\nYou'll see the base and internet.\n\n99\n00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.670\nWe've got those added here.\n\n100\n00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.040\nWe could go in and we can either edit\none of the ones highlight in edit,\n\n101\n00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.980\none of the ones that is there.\n\n102\n00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.530\nAnd or, we could go ahead, and\nwe could create a brand new one.\n\n103\n00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:51.880\nAs you could see here, give it a code,\n\n104\n00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.370\ngive it a name, and put in some\nadditional security domains, right?\n\n105\n00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.990\nSo, you and me decide to classify\nsomething and put it in and\n\n106\n00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.120\nadd it myself, and then I could use\nthat to then drive analysis further on,\n\n107\n00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.840\nas I begin to understand and\nexplore what's going on,\n\n108\n00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.430\nI could delete them of course and\nmove them up and down.\n\n109\n00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.820\nAnd reorder them in necessary, as well.\n\n110\n00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.810\nAnd then I have project phases.\n\n111\n00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.650\nAnd again I can see the different\nphases that are detailed here.\n\n112\n00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.260\nRemember this is demo data.\n\n113\n00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.070\nI can create my own and\nobviously would go in and do that so\n\n114\n00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.110\nthat I could specify the different phases\nof the project that I want to examine and\n\n115\n00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.570\nI would order those and\nmake sure those are available as well.\n\n116\n00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.580\nOnce I get the basic project data and\ndescriptive data out of the way,\n\n117\n00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.310\nI can go in and start looking\nat the risk analysis section.\n\n118\n00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.840\nI have assets and\nI can click identification, go in and\n\n119\n00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.990\nsee a list of assets.\n\n120\n00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.180\nThey are predefined as we said in\nthe test set, but I can add them in.\n\n121\n00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.850\nSo you'll see here essential\nassets information and services.\n\n122\n00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.540\nSo I have in person assets,\n\n123\n00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:56.600\nremote assets, internal services,\nthings like archives are there.\n\n124\n00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.150\nI may have a technical area\nhere where I can drill down.\n\n125\n00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:05.180\nI have equipment, subcontracted\nservices facilities, personnel.\n\n126\n00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.620\nI can choose to add, as you can see,\nby right-clicking here, a new layer, so\n\n127\n00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.630\nI can add additional items,\nI can edit it, I can add new assets.\n\n128\n00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:18.010\nSo if I choose new asset,\nI can program in a new asset and specify\n\n129\n00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:22.220\nfrom the asset classes on the right here\nwhat kind of asset it's going to be.\n\n130\n00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.060\nI have hardware, I have software.\n\n131\n00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.280\nI have all sorts of things.\n\n132\n00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.230\nIf I open this up under hardware,\nyou'll see that I have a virtual machine.\n\n133\n00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.710\nLet's say I want to specify\na hardware virtual host and\n\n134\n00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.520\nI'm going to give this a name of\n\n135\n00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:44.900\nvirtual server.\n\n136\n00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.520\nAnd once I've specified that,\nI can go ahead,\n\n137\n00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.800\nlet me scroll down here so\nyou can see the bottom.\n\n138\n00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:57.350\nI can go ahead and put in the rest of\nthis information, add this up and down,\n\n139\n00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.410\nspecify information sources, what domain\nit will be a member of, is it the internet\n\n140\n00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:05.460\ndomain, is it the corporate domain,\nwhere am I going to attach the asset.\n\n141\n00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.390\nRight, so I'll be able to do all that.\n\n142\n00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:11.580\nSpecify all the information, and\nwhen I'm done I could save that off, and\n\n143\n00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.190\nthen once I've done that I would be able\nto have that asset available, right?\n\n144\n00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:16.880\nDo I want to save my changes, yes or no?\n\n145\n00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.830\nLet's say I did save it.\n\n146\n00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.620\nI would see it available here and I can\ninteract with it and I can obviously then\n\n147\n00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:29.240\nuse these assets to drive a examination\nof the risks and a documentary\n\n148\n00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.350\nrecord is being created of all the things\nthat I want to be able to use.\n\n149\n00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:35.740\nAnd so you see,\nyou've got actual assets themselves,\n\n150\n00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:40.970\nidentifying the classes, the valuation\nof the assets Is available here as well.\n\n151\n00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:45.090\nI can go in and I can assign monetary\nvalues to each of the assets, and\n\n152\n00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:46.110\nunderstand what they are.\n\n153\n00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:48.400\nRemember, quantitative money based, right?\n\n154\n00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.126\nSo dollar values.\n\n155\n00:07:49.126 --> 00:07:53.646\nSo, I can program in the monetary\nvalue of all of these assets, and\n\n156\n00:07:53.646 --> 00:07:56.172\nI can go in and specify what they are.\n\n157\n00:07:56.172 --> 00:08:01.014\nAnd then once I've done all that,\nI can go ahead, and I can look at threats.\n\n158\n00:08:01.014 --> 00:08:05.418\nRight, so do I have different\nkinds of threats based on\n\n159\n00:08:05.418 --> 00:08:08.210\nthe criteria that I specify here?\n\n160\n00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.910\nI can go ahead and add them up and\ndeep detail out what they are and\n\n161\n00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:13.320\naccount for them.\n\n162\n00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.640\nI can also go in and\n\n163\n00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:18.670\nI can look at identification valuation\nof threats, I can look at safeguard.\n\n164\n00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:22.710\nSafe guards are controls or\ncounter measures so I can add those in,\n\n165\n00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:26.500\nidentify them create valuation\nassociated with them.\n\n166\n00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.860\nI can look at impact and risk, accumulated\nvalues, right, deflected values.\n\n167\n00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:36.600\nSo I can aggregate up all the information\nand all of the impact can be assessed, as\n\n168\n00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.740\nwell as the value of the countermeasures,\nand I can then make my determinations.\n\n169\n00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.760\nSo I have a very detailed and\n\n170\n00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.670\nvery thorough set of tools\nthat I can play with here.\n\n171\n00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:50.020\nAnd then once I've done all this, put in\nthe additional protections that I may want\n\n172\n00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:53.010\nto catalog out and essentially deal with.\n\n173\n00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:59.440\nOnce I've done all this, I can then\nbring up a report and I can go ahead and\n\n174\n00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:05.070\nI can either create a report here and\nlook at graphs, or I can have text output.\n\n175\n00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:07.180\nI can do a report from template.\n\n176\n00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:12.639\nSo, let's say I want to do a ISO\n27,000 compliance report, right?\n\n177\n00:09:12.639 --> 00:09:15.168\nAnd I can do that from\nthe 2013 to the 2005 edition.\n\n178\n00:09:15.168 --> 00:09:19.890\nNow, you'll see the eval license doesn't\ngive full access to all the reports.\n\n179\n00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:20.820\nSo obviously,\n\n180\n00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.970\nI'm not going to be able to pull up\na detailed report like an ISO report.\n\n181\n00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:27.350\nBut, in the fully licensed version\nof this product I would be able to\n\n182\n00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:31.760\nhave a report that's templated out and\nstructured around the ISO 27000 standard.\n\n183\n00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:38.300\nAnd as a result of that I could then use\nthat format to drive audit findings or\n\n184\n00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.800\npresent information to senior managers and\ndo a variety of things.\n\n185\n00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.040\nSo I can look at the risk analysis report.\n\n186\n00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.580\nAnd again, the reports are not necessarily\ngonna be available in the evaluation\n\n187\n00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:51.630\nedition, but I at least want you to\nsee some of the items that are there.\n\n188\n00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:55.430\nI can look at a risk summary in\nthe text form and see, okay,\n\n189\n00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:59.960\nclassification, assets will be selected,\nso I'll go in and select all\n\n190\n00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.750\nthe different assets that may be\navailable, make sure I make my selections.\n\n191\n00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.680\nInformation sources, security domains,\n\n192\n00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.500\netc, you can see all the different things,\ndetail that on the demo data.\n\n193\n00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:14.210\nAnd then, once I've done that,\neither HTML or RTF where I make my choice,\n\n194\n00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.060\neither by layer or by domain.\n\n195\n00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:19.230\nAgain, I would then be able to\nclick OK and generate the report.\n\n196\n00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:22.130\nAnd so I would get all those reports,\nvalue models, long and\n\n197\n00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:25.450\nshort, I can go in and\nsee all this kind of stuff.\n\n198\n00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:30.060\nI also have security profiles, right, that\nI may be able to build that are related to\n\n199\n00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.920\nin this case ISO 27,002,\nwhich is the code of practice and\n\n200\n00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.710\ncontrols for the ISMS, the Information\nSecurity Management System.\n\n201\n00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:42.030\nI'd be able to profile those and\nuse those against the actual tool here and\n\n202\n00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.830\nunderstand the risks associated with this,\nright.\n\n203\n00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:51.480\nIf I go in, let me just, one second,\nthere we go, we just cancel out of there.\n\n204\n00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:55.950\nIf I go in and decide that I don't wanna\nsave my chain, so let's just relaunch\n\n205\n00:10:55.950 --> 00:11:00.450\nthe tool, look at another way of\nexamining what's going on in here.\n\n206\n00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:03.430\nOkay, so I did quantitative,\nlet's look at qualitative, right?\n\n207\n00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:06.440\nWe took a look at what the quantitative\nanalysis may look like.\n\n208\n00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.710\nLet's open up the same project and\nlet's just open up our\n\n209\n00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:16.720\ndefault data and again,\njust do the same thing.\n\n210\n00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:21.500\nSwitch our level,\ngo into basic and then same idea,\n\n211\n00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.050\nwrite project risk analysis reports.\n\n212\n00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:26.048\nSo when we go in.\n\n213\n00:11:28.862 --> 00:11:33.990\nWe can generate these reports, this one\nactually does the graph and shows me.\n\n214\n00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:35.450\nAnd, again, it's clearly marked, right?\n\n215\n00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:38.680\nHey, eval,\nno mistaking what this is, right?\n\n216\n00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.180\nBut I can see that I can graph out\nsome of the information that's there.\n\n217\n00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:45.510\nNow, the color coding on this without\na key really doesn't make a lot of sense,\n\n218\n00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:49.010\nbut I'll generate one that actually\nmay show us a little bit more.\n\n219\n00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:52.350\nSo let's take a look at one that\nmay actually be a little bit more\n\n220\n00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:53.560\nvaluable here.\n\n221\n00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:57.720\nLet's look at a value of assets, right?\n\n222\n00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.060\nLet's draw that out.\n\n223\n00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:04.990\nAnd we can see, that the information\ntracking up top, scale zero to ten.\n\n224\n00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:09.850\nDown here, I see personal assets,\nremote assets, in person, etc.\n\n225\n00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:13.180\nAgain, I would need a color coded\nkey to truly understand this, and\n\n226\n00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.230\nthere's my legend, right,\nit can bring that out.\n\n227\n00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:19.040\nBut you can imagine I wanna use data\nthat's actually going to be valuable, and\n\n228\n00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.630\nreal to my organization,\nbut I could see this.\n\n229\n00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:24.490\nI can also export out to CSV,\nwhich is nice.\n\n230\n00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:27.420\nSo when I do that, and\nI export out to CSV and\n\n231\n00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:31.120\nlet's just take a look at what\nthey may look at for one second.\n\n232\n00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:35.210\nSo I've got an exported spreadsheet\nalready for accumulated risks that\n\n233\n00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:39.080\nwe can look at, and just bring up\nthat I exported out as a CSV file.\n\n234\n00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.160\nAnd we'd be able to look at that, right?\n\n235\n00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:48.220\nSo you can see that,\nsee if I can do this, I can never\n\n236\n00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:52.070\nget that to work the right way when I want\nto extend that out, extend it all out.\n\n237\n00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:54.070\nThere we go, okay.\nSo, you know this goes out to CSV.\n\n238\n00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:57.965\nThis particular export may not be all\nthat valuable without the understanding\n\n239\n00:12:57.965 --> 00:13:00.679\nof the data, but again,\nI could export all this out and\n\n240\n00:13:00.679 --> 00:13:03.111\nI could begin to work with\nthis in the CSV format.\n\n241\n00:13:03.111 --> 00:13:05.571\nWhat would be valuable\nwith the CSV export,\n\n242\n00:13:05.571 --> 00:13:07.940\ncan I import that into another tool?\n\n243\n00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:08.990\nDo reporting with in another form,\n\n244\n00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:10.465\nI can do all sorts of stuff\nwith that data, right.\n\n245\n00:13:10.465 --> 00:13:11.950\nSo, using a tool like this,\nlet's go back in here.\n\n246\n00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:15.550\nSo, using a tool like this,\nlet's go back in here.\n\n247\n00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:18.050\nUsing a tool like this\nto be able to bring out\n\n248\n00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:21.740\nsome of the information could\nactually be very valuable, right?\n\n249\n00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:25.620\nWe may be able to benefit\nfrom some of this,\n\n250\n00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:29.990\nlet me see,\naccumulate a risk on the asset side.\n\n251\n00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:37.700\nAnd let's just put those assets in there,\nbring those in and do that.\n\n252\n00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:43.922\nLet's just draw that and\nwe can get a nice overview chart.\n\n253\n00:13:43.922 --> 00:13:47.560\nAnd you can see you know the spiderweb\nchart just kind of looking down,\n\n254\n00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.700\nit's different ways of documenting this,\nI'm putting this in.\n\n255\n00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:55.250\nI could switch it and I can change it,\nlook at the sideways, graphs.\n\n256\n00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:59.618\nIt's got the bar graph,\nI could do the cone or the explosion,\n\n257\n00:13:59.618 --> 00:14:04.238\nI could do the star, like there's\nall these different graphs and\n\n258\n00:14:04.238 --> 00:14:08.858\nit's a very, very responsive and\nvery flexible kind of tool that\n\n259\n00:14:08.858 --> 00:14:12.985\ngives me the capability to do\nall these different things.\n\n260\n00:14:12.985 --> 00:14:15.883\nScroll over a little bit so we can\nget back up there and close that out.\n\n261\n00:14:15.883 --> 00:14:19.906\nYou know in addition to all that,\n\n262\n00:14:19.906 --> 00:14:25.660\nwhat I can also do is\nyou'll notice under here.\n\n263\n00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:33.510\nJust like I showed you before,\nwe can't generate the text reports here,\n\n264\n00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:34.500\nbut same idea.\n\n265\n00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:38.902\nI can go in and I can choose how to\nactually generate whatever this is,\n\n266\n00:14:38.902 --> 00:14:42.810\nmark it accordingly, and then generate\nthe output for that format and\n\n267\n00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:46.640\nallow myself to then export that file,\nand give it to somebody, right.\n\n268\n00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:51.980\nSo this is actually going to prove to be,\nI think you'll find a valuable tool.\n\n269\n00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.650\nIf you wanna be able to work with it, you\ncan select and import your own templates,\n\n270\n00:14:56.650 --> 00:15:00.960\nand do all sorts of risk assessment and\nrisk analysis as a result.\n\n271\n00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.060\nAnd so this is one of the tools\nthat we often will use and\n\n272\n00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:08.730\nit'll interact when we are doing in the\nfield, doing actual work like this, and\n\n273\n00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:13.230\nactually able to bring the bear,\nif we go into expert here,\n\n274\n00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:16.840\nright, and just add more capabilities.\n\n275\n00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.930\nWe have the ability to be\nable to bring the bear.\n\n276\n00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:23.820\nYou get a little bit more information and\nmore assessment of it.\n\n277\n00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:27.220\nAnd this kind of a tool though this\nmay not be the only tool that we use.\n\n278\n00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:30.630\nBut this kind of a tool will give\nus the output, the reports and\n\n279\n00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:33.695\neverything we need in order to be\nable to present this information.\n\n280\n00:15:33.695 --> 00:15:38.395\nLet me show you one other aspect, or\nway of looking at information here.\n\n281\n00:15:38.395 --> 00:15:41.255\nAgain, let's do\nBusiness Impact Analysis down below.\n\n282\n00:15:41.255 --> 00:15:45.124\nLet's go back, let's look at Quantitative\nAnalysis under here real quick.\n\n283\n00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:59.396\nJust bring this in and open this up,\nscroll over here so you can see this.\n\n284\n00:16:03.797 --> 00:16:10.790\nAll right, so again we have our assessment\nof the assets, the threats, the impact.\n\n285\n00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:14.000\nBut notice we got something called Backup\nEquipment, right, so we're dealing with\n\n286\n00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.200\nbusiness impact analysis and disaster\nrecovery, business continuity management.\n\n287\n00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.640\nSo we're adding in assets that\nhave to do with backup and\n\n288\n00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.730\nhow we're going to be able to manage that.\n\n289\n00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:27.460\nWe can bring in our SLA information and\nprovide that if we wanted to, so\n\n290\n00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:29.410\nwe'd have the ability\nto interact with that.\n\n291\n00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:32.570\nWe've also got our controls\nas we said are safeguard.\n\n292\n00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:35.870\nSo we can certainly look at\nany one of those things and\n\n293\n00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:40.320\nadd in essential information services,\n\n294\n00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:43.410\nedit the targets,\nall the kind of stuff that we can add in.\n\n295\n00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:48.520\nWe also have the ability to be able to go\nin, bring in our security procedures and\n\n296\n00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:49.620\nour policies.\n\n297\n00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:53.420\nSo we're able to document all of\nthis information, specifically\n\n298\n00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:57.990\nas part of our safe guards, so we'll be\nable to bring in and add in our policies.\n\n299\n00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:02.632\nSo we can go in and look at our\ncontrols and our counter measures, and\n\n300\n00:17:02.632 --> 00:17:06.712\nbring them in, document each one,\nand them measure them.\n\n301\n00:17:06.712 --> 00:17:11.112\nYou could see the safeguards\nare listed and if we scroll over,\n\n302\n00:17:11.112 --> 00:17:14.917\njust move down just a little bit and\nas we scroll over,\n\n303\n00:17:14.917 --> 00:17:18.552\nwe can see that we have,\nit's hard to read I know but\n\n304\n00:17:18.552 --> 00:17:22.969\nwe have the ability to be able to\nspecify for each one of these.\n\n305\n00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:27.230\nWhat it is, so\nprotection of media, for instance,\n\n306\n00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:32.080\nwe could open that up, see the\nsub-categories, we can go in and, again,\n\n307\n00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:35.840\nthese little pins open up and indicate\nthat there is something down below.\n\n308\n00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:40.260\nAnd we can go in and we can specify the\ninformation necessary to code these, and\n\n309\n00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:44.460\nspecify what level they operate at and\nhow we're assessing them.\n\n310\n00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:49.070\nAnd, based on these controls and how they\nmap, we then get a full rendering of\n\n311\n00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:52.540\nthe information about how we actually\ndocument our policies, and our procedures,\n\n312\n00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:55.980\nour safeguards, our countermeasures,\nand all the things that go into this.\n\n313\n00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:59.580\nSo it's a very detailed, very intricate\ntool, they provide training for\n\n314\n00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.220\nthis tool online as part of\nthe acquisition and the license,\n\n315\n00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:05.120\nso you can interact and\nlearn about how to use it.\n\n316\n00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.423\nOn average,\nit takes somebody probably about three or\n\n317\n00:18:07.423 --> 00:18:09.875\nfour sessions to prefigure out\nhow to use a tool like this,\n\n318\n00:18:09.875 --> 00:18:12.742\nit seems very complicated on the surface,\nbut it's actually not.\n\n319\n00:18:12.742 --> 00:18:17.396\nOnce you get a for the templates and\nthe flow make it work very easily and\n\n320\n00:18:17.396 --> 00:18:21.540\nthen once we've done all that, we have\nresidual impact in risk which again is\n\n321\n00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:26.581\nunique to this particular thought process,\nwith the accumulated values, values,\n\n322\n00:18:26.581 --> 00:18:29.573\nwe can go in and we can look at\nthe impact and the risk, and\n\n323\n00:18:29.573 --> 00:18:33.950\nunderstand what the ultimate output\nmay be, potential current target.\n\n324\n00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:37.800\nUnderstand how to weigh all that and\nassess the values because we're doing\n\n325\n00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.730\na quantitative assessment, and understand\nthe impact to the business based on\n\n326\n00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:45.270\neither the acquisition or loss of\nthe service, and how we detail that.\n\n327\n00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:48.870\nThen we have our DR plan here, we can\nbring in the disaster recovery plan and\n\n328\n00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:53.430\nyou can see that we are able to assign\nvalues based on a timeline here for\n\n329\n00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:57.160\nall the assets and\ndetail out our disaster recovery plan and\n\n330\n00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.480\nhow we're going to do with assets.\n\n331\n00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:02.650\nSo we're able to set up our timelines and\nable to assign value.\n\n332\n00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:07.257\nFor those timelines as we move through and\nbring all that information to bear in one\n\n333\n00:19:07.257 --> 00:19:10.884\ntool so that we can document\neverything and have it in one place.\n\n334\n00:19:10.884 --> 00:19:16.157\n&gt;&gt; I really like this kind of tool,\nbecause it allows us to instead of having,\n\n335\n00:19:16.157 --> 00:19:21.682\njust coming at you like a paper or just\nour own ideas that we have one spot, it's\n\n336\n00:19:21.682 --> 00:19:27.950\nalmost like, computer management, right\nas you run a network or you run a system.\n\n337\n00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:30.384\nI have one spot that I go into and\nI control everything, and\n\n338\n00:19:30.384 --> 00:19:31.537\nthat's what this allows.\n\n339\n00:19:31.537 --> 00:19:32.330\n&gt;&gt; So it's centralized.\n\n340\n00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:33.706\n&gt;&gt; Right, centrally,\nthat's the word I'm looking for.\n\n341\n00:19:33.706 --> 00:19:34.882\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Aggregation of all of our data.\n\n342\n00:19:34.882 --> 00:19:36.204\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; Allows us to do that.\n\n343\n00:19:36.204 --> 00:19:39.966\n&gt;&gt; Multiple people can work in it, it's\ngot sharp and shiny nice little pies, and\n\n344\n00:19:39.966 --> 00:19:43.520\ndiagrams, and graphs, and all of\nthe good stuff which management loves.\n\n345\n00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:47.236\nBecause you start throwing jargon\nat them and they go yeah, yeah,\n\n346\n00:19:47.236 --> 00:19:50.523\nI wonder when tea time is,\nbecause that's important to me.\n\n347\n00:19:50.523 --> 00:19:53.328\nRight, you can give them something\nthat they can latch on and\n\n348\n00:19:53.328 --> 00:19:57.400\nkeep them away from that whole I want to\npass out from watching this kind of stuff.\n\n349\n00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.940\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and see there's many, many\ndifferent ways to find a tool like this.\n\n350\n00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:02.140\nRight, so lets just do something,\n\n351\n00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:05.130\nwe've looked at the tool, right,\nlet's just get rid of that for a minute.\n\n352\n00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:09.124\nLets go out and lets do find,\nlets fire up the Internet browser here for\n\n353\n00:20:09.124 --> 00:20:11.640\njust a moment, alright, and if we look at,\n\n354\n00:20:15.588 --> 00:20:19.693\nRisk management tools and\njust do a quick search,\n\n355\n00:20:19.693 --> 00:20:24.873\nyou'll see that there are all\nsorts of tools that will come up,\n\n356\n00:20:24.873 --> 00:20:30.955\nand by no means are we going to be\nlacking for opportunities to find tools.\n\n357\n00:20:30.955 --> 00:20:33.377\nBut you'll see there's a bunch of them,\nand\n\n358\n00:20:33.377 --> 00:20:37.329\nyou can engage with whatever ones you\nthink may or may not be valuable, but\n\n359\n00:20:37.329 --> 00:20:40.030\nthere are many,\nmany different tools out there.\n\n360\n00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:42.150\nSome from vendors we know, the SCI,\n\n361\n00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:45.220\nthe software enterprise\ninstitute at Carnegie Mellon.\n\n362\n00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:47.130\nSo we can take a look at\ntools that they have,\n\n363\n00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:50.750\nthere's all sorts of different tools,\nsome are free, some you pay for.\n\n364\n00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.900\nRight, but the idea is that it\nwouldn't be hard to find tools.\n\n365\n00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:56.150\nWhat's hard,\nis to find tools that work well for you,\n\n366\n00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:59.570\ngiven the kind of environment you operate\nin, and what you're looking to accomplish,\n\n367\n00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:04.270\nand Pillar Ear may or\nmay not be the right tool for you.\n\n368\n00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:07.040\nThere are so\nmany others that exist out there as well,\n\n369\n00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:10.100\nthat you may want to\ninvestigate and/or work with.\n\n370\n00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:12.960\nAnd so, really from the incident handler,\n\n371\n00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:17.100\nthe IT security manager,\nThe IT security professional perspective.\n\n372\n00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.490\nYou build out the tool set,\n\n373\n00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:23.510\ntake recommendations from people that you\nare either gonna look favorably on and\n\n374\n00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:26.060\nwant to get their opinion,\ntry out different tools.\n\n375\n00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:29.330\nI love the fact that a lot of the vendors\ntoday will give you demos and let you say,\n\n376\n00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:33.220\nokay here's license for a week or\nwhatever and go and play with it.\n\n377\n00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:36.580\nTake advantage of that, beat on the tool,\nsee how it works, see if you like it.\n\n378\n00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:39.950\nIf you like it use it, if you don't\nHey you know, so you use the tool,\n\n379\n00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:40.560\nyou didn't care for it.\n\n380\n00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:44.370\nNo big deal, now you know better, and then\nif the business is gonna pay for the tool,\n\n381\n00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:46.810\ncuz you know a lot of these\ntools will cost money.\n\n382\n00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:51.650\nI mean the license I think for this tool\nis probably about $1000, something like\n\n383\n00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:55.680\nthat, right, so not the most expensive\nthing in the world, but not cheap either.\n\n384\n00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:59.298\nAnd, I'm not suggesting you have to go out\nand buy it yourself, but if you work for\n\n385\n00:21:59.298 --> 00:22:02.762\na company, you may be asked to make\nrecommendation about what that tool is, or\n\n386\n00:22:02.762 --> 00:22:04.304\nwhich one we think you should use.\n\n387\n00:22:04.304 --> 00:22:07.276\nYou may wanna be aware of that and\nobviously takes steps to recommend\n\n388\n00:22:07.276 --> 00:22:10.730\na tool that you're comfortable with more\nlikely to be successful as a result.\n\n389\n00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:13.560\nSo wanted to take opportunity and\ngive you some insights\n\n390\n00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.760\ninto what a typical dashboard and\ntypical tool may look like for\n\n391\n00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:19.750\nthis but remember there are many\nmany ways to get to this point.\n\n392\n00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:22.720\nI have customers that have build their\nown tools from the grounds up customers\n\n393\n00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:25.910\nthat are using SharePoint as the back\nend to do all the hosting and,\n\n394\n00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:30.560\nset up the web parts and the dashboarding,\nthe business intelligence assessment.\n\n395\n00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:34.160\nMany vendors create tools that\nintegrate into tools like SharePoint\n\n396\n00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.400\nto create that work flow and that ability.\n\n397\n00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.820\nAnd this is typically part of an asset\nmanagement thought process so\n\n398\n00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:41.410\nyou may see configuration management,\n\n399\n00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:44.560\nasset management packages,\nthat is a risk assessment component.\n\n400\n00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.880\nSo, there's lots of different ways\nto do this, the real question,\n\n401\n00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.930\nwhat makes sense for\nyou at the end of the day?\n\n402\n00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:52.590\n&gt;&gt; Well, Adam, we do appreciate you\nwalking us through using the pillar tool\n\n403\n00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:55.089\nand seeing it's functionality and\nreminding us,\n\n404\n00:22:55.089 --> 00:22:57.779\nit's not the only a person\nwith their name in the ring.\n\n405\n00:22:57.779 --> 00:23:02.610\nYou can check out many multiple different\nones, go to our favorite search engine.\n\n406\n00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:05.620\nFind the one that works for us,\nget comfortable with it and\n\n407\n00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:09.155\nthen start building a repertoire\nof those types of tools.\n\n408\n00:23:09.155 --> 00:23:11.835\nSo that as we bounce around\nfrom client to client\n\n409\n00:23:11.835 --> 00:23:14.835\nwe have a little more experience\nthan just with one thing.\n\n410\n00:23:14.835 --> 00:23:15.585\nThat being said,\n\n411\n00:23:15.585 --> 00:23:20.215\nwe appreciate you joining us today and\nwe've really sunk our teeth into risk.\n\n412\n00:23:20.215 --> 00:23:25.427\nLooking forward to moving on Into\nother areas of expertise that\n\n413\n00:23:25.427 --> 00:23:27.807\nan ECIH will need to know.\n\n414\n00:23:27.807 --> 00:23:31.637\nAnd you guiding us down that path, that\nbeing said, it looks like we are done for\n\n415\n00:23:31.637 --> 00:23:32.547\nthis episode.\n\n416\n00:23:32.547 --> 00:23:38.537\nWe do appreciate you joining us today,\nwe appreciate Adam for speaking.\n\n417\n00:23:38.537 --> 00:23:42.277\nBut signing off from ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n418\n00:23:42.277 --> 00:23:43.087\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n419\n00:23:43.087 --> 00:23:46.194\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n420\n00:23:46.194 --> 00:23:52.081\n[MUSIC]\n\n421\n00:23:52.081 --> 00:23:54.040\nThank you for watching IT Pro TV.\n\n",

watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.083 --> 00:00:13.050\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n5\n00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.980\nGreetings everyone and welcome to\nanother great episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.340\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n7\n00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.070\nin today's episode we are back\nwith more on our ECIH series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.910\nThat's right.\nThe UC Counsel Certified Incident Handler,\n\n9\n00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.210\nif that's what you're here for,\nthen you've come to the right place.\n\n10\n00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.330\nAnd, of course, joining us in the studio\nto guide us through that endeavor our\n\n11\n00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.550\ngood friend and mentor, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n12\n00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:34.410\nAdam, welcome back sir.\n\n13\n00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.570\nHow goes it today?\n\n14\n00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.210\n&gt;&gt; It goes well.\n\n15\n00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.350\nI'm feeling very bright\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n16\n00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.990\n&gt;&gt; And very-\n&gt;&gt; Something different about you.\n\n17\n00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.310\n&gt;&gt; There is.\n&gt;&gt; There's a glow.\n\n18\n00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.412\n&gt;&gt; There is a [LAUGH] pinkish\nhue to my character today.\n\n19\n00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:47.592\nHopefully, that will work well for\neverybody out there.\n\n20\n00:00:47.592 --> 00:00:48.553\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If not,\n\n21\n00:00:48.553 --> 00:00:49.760\nyou may want to tune in tomorrow.\n\n22\n00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.640\nWe'll see how that goes.\n\n23\n00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.800\nBut anyway, we're gonna continue\ntalking about incident handling.\n\n24\n00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.500\nWe thought we'd spend some time with\nyou talking about the steps involved\n\n25\n00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.250\nwith incident handling.\n\n26\n00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.070\nWe spent a lot of time up until\nnow what incidents can be,\n\n27\n00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.640\nhow they occur, what are the risks\ninvolved, that we may have to address as\n\n28\n00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.550\na security professional, as an IT\nprofessional, as incident handler.\n\n29\n00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.110\nAnd there is a methodology here and\na thought process at work.\n\n30\n00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.620\nWe want to go through it with you,\n\n31\n00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.670\nhow do we identify an incident,\nwhat are some of the warning signs?\n\n32\n00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.080\nWe'll start talking about that.\n\n33\n00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.040\nBut we're gonna move through what incident\nhandling is talk about the steps involved,\n\n34\n00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.060\nwhat's into the management, what are\nincident policies, all the things we have\n\n35\n00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.880\nto be aware of as we continue building\nour knowledge around incident management,\n\n36\n00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.130\nincident handling, and\nall of the associated concerns\n\n37\n00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.230\nthat we would have to address in\norder to do this successfully.\n\n38\n00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.742\nSo let's start up by talking\nabout what an incident is.\n\n39\n00:01:44.742 --> 00:01:46.950\nWhen we think about incidents,\n\n40\n00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.800\nwe often talk about the fact that things\nare instant or describe them that way,\n\n41\n00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.640\nbut we don't always have a clear\nunderstanding of what that may means.\n\n42\n00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.200\nSo, Daniel do you mind helping\nme out here for a minute?\n\n43\n00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.400\nI know you're always up for a challenge,\nso if I said to you describe for\n\n44\n00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.550\nme, define for me in your mind, in your\nwords, what you think an incident is?\n\n45\n00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:07.520\nWhat comes to mind?\n\n46\n00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.340\n&gt;&gt; I would think an incident is anything\nthat happen out side of skip of\n\n47\n00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.890\nnormal operations.\n\n48\n00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.670\n&gt;&gt; All right, so anything that happens\noutside the skip of normal operations.\n\n49\n00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.490\nSo would that means that\nif it not normal for\n\n50\n00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.190\nit to rain outside the rain\nwould then will be a incident?\n\n51\n00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.320\n&gt;&gt; No, because rain or\nunless your business is effect by rain,\n\n52\n00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.210\nthen yes it would be.\n\n53\n00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.910\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so now we're incorporating\nsomething very important,\n\n54\n00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.890\nnot just anything that happens outside\nthe normal scope of operations, but things\n\n55\n00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.000\nthat happen outside the normal scope of\noperations that may impact our business.\n\n56\n00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.710\nAnd is that impact to the business gonna\nhave to be negative perhaps in order for\n\n57\n00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.010\nit to rate the classification\nof an incident?\n\n58\n00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.980\n&gt;&gt; I would think that it would\ntypically be something negative, but\n\n59\n00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.060\nnot necessarily.\n\n60\n00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.030\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nAnd\n\n61\n00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.190\nDiego's obviously right to hedge\nhis bets a little bit here, right?\n\n62\n00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.500\nBecause incidents, and this is one of\nthe funny things about what we do, right?\n\n63\n00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.920\nVocabulary language is so\nimportant to what we do and\n\n64\n00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.580\ngetting everybody to literally\nbe on the same page,\n\n65\n00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.130\nspeak the same language,\ncan at times be a challenge,\n\n66\n00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.450\nright, as I'm sure we both have many\nstories about and know all too well.\n\n67\n00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.270\nAnd when you say something to somebody,\nif you're not clear and you don't have\n\n68\n00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:22.230\nthe context around what that means, there\nmay be a difference in interpretation.\n\n69\n00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.930\nAnd when we think about\nwhat an incident is,\n\n70\n00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.240\nI like where Daniel was\ngoing with the definition.\n\n71\n00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.780\nI like things that happen outside\nthe normal operational parameters in\n\n72\n00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:30.690\nthe business.\n\n73\n00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.520\nBut I like adding that those\nthings will have an impact on our\n\n74\n00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.590\nability to operate or to be able to create\nnormalcy, however we would think of that.\n\n75\n00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.650\nAnd while most of those impacts\ntraditionally are classified as negative,\n\n76\n00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.120\nnot all are.\n\n77\n00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.690\nBut ultimately,\nif the impact leads to a disruption or\n\n78\n00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.630\nsomehow an interruption of our\nability to create normalcy,\n\n79\n00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.640\nthen it should be\nclassified as an incident.\n\n80\n00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.670\nNow, that doesn't always mean that\nthere's a negative consequence because\n\n81\n00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.860\nmaybe I turned something off and\nI turned it right back on again.\n\n82\n00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.080\nThere was a small disruption,\nprobably didn't really affect anybody.\n\n83\n00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.810\nProbably didn't cost us\nanything significant.\n\n84\n00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.160\nMay or may not have been negative is my\npoint, but it still led to disruption in\n\n85\n00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.410\nservice, disruption in our\nability to have normalcy.\n\n86\n00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.830\nSo I like what Daniel described for us.\n\n87\n00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:23.270\nI like the way we put it together,\nbut I want to be clear with you that\n\n88\n00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.220\nmost definitions of incidence involve\nthe attachment of the concept\n\n89\n00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.500\nof negative outcome in order to validate\nthat that is indeed an incident.\n\n90\n00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.820\nSo what I would suggest, as a working\ndefinition for us for this episode and\n\n91\n00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.080\nfor our discussions in general, is\nanything happening outside the boundaries\n\n92\n00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.300\nof normal operations that involves\ndisruption or interruption to normalcy.\n\n93\n00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.154\nAnd it has a negative outcome or\nconsequence associated with it.\n\n94\n00:04:49.154 --> 00:04:51.855\nDon't ask me to repeat that because\nnever gonna get that right again.\n\n95\n00:04:51.855 --> 00:04:53.749\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But if we think about the fact there's\n\n96\n00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:55.464\ndisruption of service and normalcy, and\n\n97\n00:04:55.464 --> 00:04:58.649\nthere's usually a negative consequence\nassociated with that disruption,\n\n98\n00:04:58.649 --> 00:05:01.310\nthat's a great place for\nus to start with regards to incidents.\n\n99\n00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.764\nNow-\n&gt;&gt; Tell me more about that thing\n\n100\n00:05:02.764 --> 00:05:03.268\nyou just said.\n\n101\n00:05:03.268 --> 00:05:06.110\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Could you repeat that please?\n\n102\n00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.052\nSo are all incidents as I said negative?\n\n103\n00:05:08.052 --> 00:05:09.800\nOf course, they're not all negative.\n\n104\n00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.543\nAre all incidents gonna have the same\nlevel of disruption associated with them,\n\n105\n00:05:13.543 --> 00:05:16.240\nand therefore,\nthe same negative consequence?\n\n106\n00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.790\nAbsolutely not.\n\n107\n00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.330\nWe're gonna prioritize, right?\n\n108\n00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.370\nSo somebody locking themselves\nout of their account.\n\n109\n00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.790\nWhen they try to log in, and\nperhaps our default threshold was two or\n\n110\n00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.390\nthree bad log ons, and they, for\n\n111\n00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.750\nwhatever reason, surpassed that\nthreshold without being successful.\n\n112\n00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.020\nYeah, that's an incident.\n\n113\n00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.460\nIt may not be a negative incident\noverall but it's negative for\n\n114\n00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.010\nthe person that got locked out.\n\n115\n00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.220\nBut the reality is it may not really\nimpact anybody all that significantly\n\n116\n00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.710\nin the grand scheme of things cuz\nas long as it's a legitimate user\n\n117\n00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.360\nthat's being locked out and\nthey're locked out for legitimate reasons.\n\n118\n00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.720\nThey just forgot their password or for\n\n119\n00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.970\nsome reason the keyboard\ndoesn't work the right way.\n\n120\n00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.970\nYou get that sometimes\nin virtual machines,\n\n121\n00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.230\ntrying to translate that through the key\nstrokes, don't always work the right way.\n\n122\n00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:02.320\nWhatever the case may be, if they get\nlocked out due to just normal operations\n\n123\n00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.460\nand as a result they have to\nreset their password, but\n\n124\n00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.750\nwe have a self-service solution\nthat allows them to do that.\n\n125\n00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.830\nIs that really a negative\nincident at the end of the day?\n\n126\n00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:10.470\nIt's an incident.\n\n127\n00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.530\nWe wanna track it.\n\n128\n00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.480\nWe wanna be aware of the fact\nthrough logging that it occurred.\n\n129\n00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.060\nWanna have a record of it,\nin other words, right?\n\n130\n00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.700\nWanna audit it, wanna have\ntransaction visibility into that.\n\n131\n00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.200\nBut in the grand scheme of things, the\nuser was intravenous for a couple minutes.\n\n132\n00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.290\nNo confidentiality, integrity or\navailability was compromised.\n\n133\n00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.550\nReally nothing significant in\nany way shape or form occurred.\n\n134\n00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:36.200\nBut if a bad actor, a threat source,\nthat is taking advantage of or\n\n135\n00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.930\nexploiting a weakness,\na vulnerability is introducing risk\n\n136\n00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.740\ninto our world by hacking into\na legitimate user account and\n\n137\n00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.680\ndoing so successfully,\nthen that is a significant incident.\n\n138\n00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.520\nAnd if we're not aware of that,\nwe're not documenting that.\n\n139\n00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.470\nWe're not prioritizing that.\n\n140\n00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:53.900\nAnd we're not assessing that and\n\n141\n00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.350\nultimately responding to it,\nwe're gonna have a problem, right?\n\n142\n00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.640\nThis is the heart and soul,\nthis is what we're here to talk about.\n\n143\n00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.040\nThis is what we do with incident handling,\nand incident response and\n\n144\n00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.760\nincident management.\n\n145\n00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:08.910\nSo there definitely are gradations or\nprioritizations that have to occur.\n\n146\n00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.890\nWith regards to incident,\nincident identification and\n\n147\n00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.310\nultimately incident handling.\n\n148\n00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:17.340\nNot all incidents are equal and\nnot all responses are equal either.\n\n149\n00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:21.943\nWe should not call out the cavalry to deal\nwith the user that legitimately locked\n\n150\n00:07:21.943 --> 00:07:26.065\nthemselves out or legitimately resets\ntheir password through our self\n\n151\n00:07:26.065 --> 00:07:30.255\nservice mechanism, identifying\nthemselves through a single, dual or\n\n152\n00:07:30.255 --> 00:07:33.503\nmulti-factor authentication\nprocess along the way.\n\n153\n00:07:33.503 --> 00:07:37.061\nI, by the way, a big advocate of\nquadruple authentication factors.\n\n154\n00:07:37.061 --> 00:07:40.497\nI think you should have to do all three\nthings and then beg forgiveness for\n\n155\n00:07:40.497 --> 00:07:42.582\nyour system administrator before you get,\n\n156\n00:07:42.582 --> 00:07:45.532\nallowed to be able to resetting\nyour password and get back in.\n\n157\n00:07:45.532 --> 00:07:49.366\nJust because you get habitual offenders,\nI don't know if you see this in our track,\n\n158\n00:07:49.366 --> 00:07:52.390\nbut certain people that are just\ncontinuously locking themselves\n\n159\n00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:54.497\nup cuz they can't\nremember their passwords.\n\n160\n00:07:54.497 --> 00:07:56.095\nI believe they should be allowed to work,\n\n161\n00:07:56.095 --> 00:07:57.887\nbut they should be made\nexamples of in public.\n\n162\n00:07:57.887 --> 00:07:59.402\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think public humiliation on\n\n163\n00:07:59.402 --> 00:08:01.240\nthe square is usually a good way to go.\n\n164\n00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.410\nWe can't tar and feather anymore.\n\n165\n00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:04.030\nThat's actually been outlawed, but.\n\n166\n00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:04.910\n&gt;&gt; It is effective.\n\n167\n00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:05.420\n&gt;&gt; It is, though.\n\n168\n00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:06.670\nI mean, one or two keelhauling, right?\n\n169\n00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:10.440\nOne or two people and you don't have to\nmake an example of to many after that.\n\n170\n00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.950\n&gt;&gt; No [LAUGHTER]\n&gt;&gt; You know you don't want to be that\n\n171\n00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:12.790\nfirst person.\n\n172\n00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:13.730\n&gt;&gt; Really, I'm not doing that.\n\n173\n00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.510\n&gt;&gt; But you know, third or fourth person in\nline you're going to change your behavior\n\n174\n00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:19.070\nif that's what happens to\nthe first couple to go through.\n\n175\n00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:23.550\nSo, want to make sure that we understand,\nlegitimately,\n\n176\n00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:29.530\nwe want to tailor our response to\nthe effects if you will, right?\n\n177\n00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:31.350\nOr the scale of the incident.\n\n178\n00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:33.780\nSomebody lock themselves out legitimately,\nas I've said,\n\n179\n00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:38.140\nwe're not gonna have a full blown\nincident response associated with this.\n\n180\n00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:41.080\nWe're simply gonna document\nthe fact they're self-servicing.\n\n181\n00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.210\nWe're gonna have an audit entry,\nwe're gonna have a log entry.\n\n182\n00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:46.870\nAnd aside from that,\nthere's probably nothing that will go on.\n\n183\n00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:49.650\nWe may randomly sample that\nuser account at some point,\n\n184\n00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:50.950\nvalidate its legitimate user.\n\n185\n00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:54.350\nBut we're not gonna have anybody respond\nand really do anything significant.\n\n186\n00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:56.660\nBut if we detect hacking as I suggested.\n\n187\n00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:57.620\nBad actors, right?\n\n188\n00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:01.360\nThreat sources, exploiting\nvulnerabilities and introducing risk.\n\n189\n00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:05.130\nThat's something we have to bring\na full incident response down around.\n\n190\n00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:08.120\nAnd I'm sure that we're gonna be able\nto figure out how to deal with that,\n\n191\n00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:12.000\nremediate and mitigate that issue and\ninsure it does not happen again.\n\n192\n00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:12.770\nThat's the.\n\n193\n00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:14.690\nProcess we're going to go\nthrough at a high level.\n\n194\n00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:18.230\nSince I'm handling them at the end of the\nday, it's really a set of procedures that\n\n195\n00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:23.230\nwe figure out, we define, and\nwe ultimately broadly communicate and\n\n196\n00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:27.700\nstandardize so we can follow to address\nthe things that are recurring that\n\n197\n00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.630\nare outside the boundaries of normalcy\nas Daniel was sharing with us.\n\n198\n00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:31.190\nRight?\n\n199\n00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:35.480\nWe address the consequences of a threat\nthat may be introduced into the system and\n\n200\n00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.390\nbring risks or one or\n\n201\n00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:41.520\nmore risks into the business as a result\nof being able to go unchallenged.\n\n202\n00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.190\nSo, as incident handling is the idea\nof being able to come up with these\n\n203\n00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:48.770\nprocedures that allow us to address\nthreats and ensure that vulnerabilities\n\n204\n00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:51.820\nare not exploited by threat\nsources that lead to risks.\n\n205\n00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:53.850\nThis is what incident\nhandling will be defined as.\n\n206\n00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:57.680\nWhat are the functions of incident\nhandling that we have to engage in?\n\n207\n00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.720\nThere are three.\n\n208\n00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.715\nThree, three, look three.\n\n209\n00:09:59.715 --> 00:10:02.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; One, two, three, right?\n\n210\n00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:03.350\nSo there are three.\n\n211\n00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:05.460\nI can count to five by the way.\n\n212\n00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:06.320\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; And I don't have to use more\n\n213\n00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.320\nthan one hand or toe in order to do that.\n\n214\n00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.130\nSo, we have three functions\nof incident handling overall.\n\n215\n00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:13.020\nI wanna make sure we're\nfamiliar with these.\n\n216\n00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:18.300\nResponse, Analysis and\nReporting are the three broad categorical\n\n217\n00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:22.230\nideas that we deal with regards to instant\nhandling, we're dealing with response.\n\n218\n00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.090\nWe've been talking a bit about response,\n\n219\n00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:27.200\nhow that would happen,\nwe've talked about analysis a little bit.\n\n220\n00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.440\nIs it a legitimate use for\n\n221\n00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:32.460\nlocking themselves out under\nnormal operational circumstances.\n\n222\n00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:37.200\nIs it a hacker, a threat source or some\nkind of bad actor who's taking advantage\n\n223\n00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.540\nof a legitimate user account under\nthe guise of masquerading or\n\n224\n00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.960\nsomehow infiltrating,\nhow do we figure that out.\n\n225\n00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:47.410\nAnd then we talked about the auditabiliy,\nthe traceability, the validation,\n\n226\n00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:51.920\nand the verification with reporting that\nwould take place to allow us to understand\n\n227\n00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:52.960\nthat these things have occurred.\n\n228\n00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.860\nAnd have a complete and accurate record,\nright, of what goes on there.\n\n229\n00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:00.120\nSo as a broad set of functions, these\nare the three that we would engage in or\n\n230\n00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.440\nengage around and\nwanna make sure we understand.\n\n231\n00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.790\nWe wanna make sure we're\ncomfortable with these and\n\n232\n00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:09.720\nhave a sense of them because these help\nus categorically from very high level,\n\n233\n00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:14.370\nto be able to drill down as we start\nto develop the methodology around\n\n234\n00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:17.280\nincidence handling and\nput things into the proper buckets.\n\n235\n00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.890\nRight?\nOr the proper areas of categorization for\n\n236\n00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:22.860\nus and help us to understand how\nincidence handling should take place.\n\n237\n00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:26.470\nThe main purpose of incident response and\nits handling minimize loss and\n\n238\n00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:27.990\nensure recovery in a timely fashion.\n\n239\n00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:30.520\nRight?\nSo if we're gonna deal with incidence\n\n240\n00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:34.600\nthat are gonna have negative consequences,\nwe've gotta minimize their impact,\n\n241\n00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.900\nwe gotta make sure that we are able\nto recover as quickly as possible,\n\n242\n00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:43.440\nwe gotta to ensure that normalcy or\nnormal operations are restored,\n\n243\n00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.900\nnot just in a timely fashion, but\nin a way that allows us to ensure\n\n244\n00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:53.235\nthat those concerns don't get propagated\nforward and continue to plague us, right?\n\n245\n00:11:53.235 --> 00:11:55.625\nIt's one thing to say yeah,\nwe got everything back to normal, but\n\n246\n00:11:55.625 --> 00:11:57.595\nthen a month later,\nthe same thing happens.\n\n247\n00:11:57.595 --> 00:12:00.025\nAnd every month,\nwe have that continuing to go on.\n\n248\n00:12:00.025 --> 00:12:01.065\nThat's not a good thing.\n\n249\n00:12:01.065 --> 00:12:04.935\nWe haven't root caused analyzed the\nincident, figured out what was wrong, and\n\n250\n00:12:04.935 --> 00:12:07.795\nactually mitigated it in a successful way.\n\n251\n00:12:07.795 --> 00:12:08.775\nRather, we've simply just,\n\n252\n00:12:08.775 --> 00:12:12.205\nyou often hear people talk about this,\nkicking the can down the road.\n\n253\n00:12:12.205 --> 00:12:15.545\nWe've just pushed it down the road\na little bit, so it'll happen again,\n\n254\n00:12:15.545 --> 00:12:18.310\nand may or\nmay not happen when we're around, but\n\n255\n00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:20.110\nsomeone else is gonna\nhave to deal with it.\n\n256\n00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:22.220\nThat's not the outcome we're looking for.\n\n257\n00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:26.280\nIncident and incidence handling should\nbe all about at the end of the day if we\n\n258\n00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:30.360\nare successful, at figuring out\nwhat the root cause analysis\n\n259\n00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.190\nlooks like on this particular incident,\nor group of incidents.\n\n260\n00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:37.170\nThere may be more than one, and\ncoming up with countermeasures, controls,\n\n261\n00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:42.580\nthat will be put in place, or modified\naugmented in some way if already there.\n\n262\n00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.330\nAdjusted fine tuned whatever\nyou want to call that,\n\n263\n00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:49.300\nto be able ensure that this particular\nvulnerability will set a vulnerability so\n\n264\n00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:52.875\nwe're exploited by the thread source\nare not going to plague us, this again.\n\n265\n00:12:52.875 --> 00:12:57.525\nWe're going to constantly, without fail,\nhave continuing evolution of\n\n266\n00:12:57.525 --> 00:13:00.455\nthe threat vectors and\nthe attack vectors that we face.\n\n267\n00:13:00.455 --> 00:13:04.625\nWe have to understand this, and be aware\nof this as security professionals and\n\n268\n00:13:04.625 --> 00:13:09.035\nincidence handlers, we have to understand\nultimately that, regardless of how good we\n\n269\n00:13:09.035 --> 00:13:14.845\nare, we're going to continuously face\nan onslaught of recycled, brand new,\n\n270\n00:13:14.845 --> 00:13:19.070\nand some combination of the two incidents\nthat are going to just keep coming.\n\n271\n00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:21.490\nRight.\nIt's not as if we do our job, show up and\n\n272\n00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:24.420\ndeclare victory and we're done would\nbe great if that was the case,\n\n273\n00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:27.990\nbut you know, this one and\ndone concept doesn't work for us, right.\n\n274\n00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:29.870\nYou're going to face\nthis on an ongoing basis.\n\n275\n00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:30.830\nAll the time.\n\n276\n00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:34.570\nYou know we're seeing, quite often,\nespecially these days,\n\n277\n00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:35.980\nyou know, the end of the year.\n\n278\n00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.680\nThe beginning of the new year\nhere in twenty seventeen,\n\n279\n00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:42.750\nwe're seeing a continuous advent of old\nattacks that are being recycled and\n\n280\n00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:46.060\nreused in order to be able\nto get into networks.\n\n281\n00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:49.410\nJust like skinny ties made it come back,\nright, from 1980s and bolos.\n\n282\n00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:50.080\nRemember bolos?\n\n283\n00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.480\nBolos made a come back,\nright, so string ties.\n\n284\n00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:56.500\nAnd I'm glad I held on to all my string\nties because I was back in fashion for\n\n285\n00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:57.900\na period of time but you know,\n\n286\n00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:01.170\nthe reality is, everything that's\nold is new again at some point.\n\n287\n00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:03.920\nLow and slow attacks,\nfragmentation attacks.\n\n288\n00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:08.050\nThings that we've known about for,\nin some cases, decades, and have\n\n289\n00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:12.090\ncontinued to battle against and thought\nhad gone away, are now making comebacks.\n\n290\n00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:13.660\nMicrosoft over the last year or\n\n291\n00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:18.790\nso had to reintroduce macro level\nsecurity and turn it back on and off.\n\n292\n00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:21.480\nIt's because they've turned\nit off because they thought\n\n293\n00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.230\nmacro viruses were a thing of the past and\nwe didn't need it.\n\n294\n00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:25.630\nWho is going to use a macro virus?\n\n295\n00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:27.760\nWhen was the last time you\nheard about one of those?\n\n296\n00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.800\nBut attackers pay attention to this stuff.\n\n297\n00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.120\nThey say look,\nsomebody let their guard down.\n\n298\n00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.280\nThere's a vulnerability there.\n\n299\n00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.720\nWe can take advantage of that.\n\n300\n00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.050\nAnd as a result,\n\n301\n00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:42.070\nmacro viruses made a huge roaring comeback\nas APTs as Advanced Persistent Threats.\n\n302\n00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:45.000\nAnd we actually saw\nguidance from Microsoft\n\n303\n00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.950\nin the middle to end of\n2016 that indicated that\n\n304\n00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:52.260\nmacro level security has to be re-enabled\nin their products if it was disabled\n\n305\n00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:56.210\nbecause there is such a strong\nprevalence of this activity going on.\n\n306\n00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:57.525\nThat you're not gonna be protected.\n\n307\n00:14:57.525 --> 00:14:59.070\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; That's a huge issue when\n\n308\n00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:00.046\nyou think about it.\n\n309\n00:15:00.046 --> 00:15:03.915\n&gt;&gt; [COUGH] You would think they would know\nthat if they let that, they reopen that\n\n310\n00:15:03.915 --> 00:15:07.783\nhole in the fence that eventually the bad\nactors are going to realize that and\n\n311\n00:15:07.783 --> 00:15:09.660\nstart flowing back through it.\n\n312\n00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:10.704\nWhy would they have turned it off?\n\n313\n00:15:10.704 --> 00:15:12.189\nWas it affecting performance?\n\n314\n00:15:12.189 --> 00:15:12.968\nOr they just said.\n\n315\n00:15:12.968 --> 00:15:14.211\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; No, no, not at all.\n\n316\n00:15:14.211 --> 00:15:18.371\nIt was such an old school thing,\nI mean literally.\n\n317\n00:15:18.371 --> 00:15:20.455\nRight, when was the last time you\nheard about a boot sector virus?\n\n318\n00:15:20.455 --> 00:15:21.750\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; When was the last time you\n\n319\n00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:26.230\nabout some of, these things that we talk\nabout, that we know about as in-the-field\n\n320\n00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:28.360\nprofessionals, as people that do this for\na living.\n\n321\n00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:32.180\nAnd that have done this in some cases for\ndecades, you would know about.\n\n322\n00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:36.800\nBut many of you listening to us\ntalking may have that background.\n\n323\n00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.000\nAnd certainly that time and that depth.\n\n324\n00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:39.650\nIn the field.\n\n325\n00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:40.680\nBut some of you may not.\n\n326\n00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:44.037\nSome of you are starting out, you're a\nlittle bit newer to this thought process.\n\n327\n00:15:44.037 --> 00:15:46.270\nAnd some of the things we're\njust rattling off here.\n\n328\n00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:48.173\nBoot sector viruses, and things like that,\n\n329\n00:15:48.173 --> 00:15:50.536\nyou may never have heard of\nJust may never know about it.\n\n330\n00:15:50.536 --> 00:15:53.924\n&gt;&gt; Now, we don't hear about them because\nwe've been protecting against them.\n\n331\n00:15:53.924 --> 00:15:55.554\nAs soon as we stop\nprotecting against them,\n\n332\n00:15:55.554 --> 00:15:57.305\nwe're gonna start hearing\nabout them again.\n\n333\n00:15:57.305 --> 00:15:58.760\n&gt;&gt; Well, you would think, right?\n\n334\n00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.090\nAnd I mean, your point's well taken.\n\n335\n00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:00.890\nI'm not disputing it,\n\n336\n00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:06.252\nI'm just pointing out that there's\ngenerational shift in everything we do.\n\n337\n00:16:06.252 --> 00:16:08.939\n&gt;&gt; And so,\nthere's generational shift in companies,\n\n338\n00:16:08.939 --> 00:16:13.840\nthere's generational shift in industries,\nthere's generational shift in mindsets.\n\n339\n00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:16.704\nThe people that thought this\nwas important, at Microsoft,\n\n340\n00:16:16.704 --> 00:16:19.400\nI'm sure somewhere still\nthink it's important.\n\n341\n00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.520\nBut whether they were the people making\ndecisions about it at the time that\n\n342\n00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.630\nthe decision was made or the guidance\nwas put out that you may not need\n\n343\n00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:30.340\nthis anymore, obviously if I had to guess,\nI would say probably not.\n\n344\n00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:32.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because clearly that was an issue.\n\n345\n00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:33.830\nBut things change.\n\n346\n00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:37.720\nAnd it's not so much hey,\nwouldn't be good to keep doing that?\n\n347\n00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.827\nI think that's not\nthe mindset we often see,\n\n348\n00:16:39.827 --> 00:16:42.000\nI think it's out of sight out of mind,\nright?\n\n349\n00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.465\nI think that's the issue because what\nhappens is you don't see it this being\n\n350\n00:16:46.465 --> 00:16:50.510\na threat for a period of time and\npeople tend to just get complacent and\n\n351\n00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:55.046\nthe tend to forget about the fact that\nthis kind behavior leads to essentially\n\n352\n00:16:55.046 --> 00:16:59.190\ninsecurity, instability, and\nultimately vulnerability.\n\n353\n00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:00.848\nAnd I don't think it's on purpose and\nI don't think anybody is saying it is and\n\n354\n00:17:00.848 --> 00:17:01.537\nI know you're not saying it is.\n\n355\n00:17:01.537 --> 00:17:02.448\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n356\n00:17:02.448 --> 00:17:06.007\n&gt;&gt; I don't think it's on purpose and\nI don't think anybody does, I think it's\n\n357\n00:17:06.007 --> 00:17:09.623\njust literally lack of understanding\nbecause it's out of sight out of mind and\n\n358\n00:17:09.623 --> 00:17:11.150\nnobody thinks about it.\n\n359\n00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:14.101\nAnd so people start taking\na different course of action\n\n360\n00:17:14.101 --> 00:17:18.029\nbecause they don't understand\nthe value of the protection mechanism.\n\n361\n00:17:18.029 --> 00:17:22.027\nObviously, clearly, from our\nperspective as security professionals,\n\n362\n00:17:22.027 --> 00:17:23.710\nas incident handlers.\n\n363\n00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:25.601\nHey, you know what?\nWe didn't do a good job of making it\n\n364\n00:17:25.601 --> 00:17:27.190\nclear that this was important.\n\n365\n00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:32.430\nSo shame on us for not continuing to\ngo out there and be an advocate, right?\n\n366\n00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:34.565\nAnd to evangelize the need for this.\n\n367\n00:17:34.565 --> 00:17:37.220\nSo that's clearly where we lay the blame.\n\n368\n00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.156\nBut ultimately, and\n\n369\n00:17:38.156 --> 00:17:41.692\nit comes back to something we talked about\nin almost every episode without fail,\n\n370\n00:17:41.692 --> 00:17:44.616\nbecause I'm so passionate about it,\nI believe so strongly in it.\n\n371\n00:17:44.616 --> 00:17:48.750\nIt's awareness and it's security\nawareness and training that wins the day.\n\n372\n00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:53.100\nIf you teach the new generations coming\nup behind you that is important and\n\n373\n00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:57.410\nthis is why, they're less likely to make\nthe same mistakes that we make, right?\n\n374\n00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:01.920\nEven though we may protect them from\nthemselves, if we're not around to tell\n\n375\n00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:05.340\nthem it's a bad idea, who's gonna\ntell them why they shouldn't do it?\n\n376\n00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:08.740\nAnd if they see it as being the path\nof least resistance not to do it\n\n377\n00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:11.570\nbecause they don't understand\nthe impact and the liability,\n\n378\n00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:14.370\nmaybe they're gonna take that route\njust because nobody's told them hey,\n\n379\n00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:16.050\nguess what,\nyou play with fire you get burned, right?\n\n380\n00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:17.644\n&gt;&gt; So that, just generational gap,\nthey're so-\n\n381\n00:18:17.644 --> 00:18:18.555\n&gt;&gt; It may be.\n\n382\n00:18:18.555 --> 00:18:21.680\n&gt;&gt; Far removed from the idea of\nthe threat they just don't realize it.\n\n383\n00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.175\n&gt;&gt; I mean at least in my perspective,\nfrom what I've seen just historically.\n\n384\n00:18:25.175 --> 00:18:27.503\nI think that has a lot to do with it.\n\n385\n00:18:27.503 --> 00:18:31.685\nI mean, people make stupid mistakes all\nthe time, there are a lot of reasons.\n\n386\n00:18:31.685 --> 00:18:34.215\nSometimes, they just do stupid\nthings cuz let's be honest,\n\n387\n00:18:34.215 --> 00:18:35.935\nthey're just not really smart.\n\n388\n00:18:35.935 --> 00:18:40.877\nBut there's other times when they make\nbad decisions because of a lack of\n\n389\n00:18:40.877 --> 00:18:42.100\nunderstanding.\n\n390\n00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:46.442\nIn other words, not because they're\njust not smart about what they do but\n\n391\n00:18:46.442 --> 00:18:49.245\nrather they're just not\naware of the issues and\n\n392\n00:18:49.245 --> 00:18:53.950\nconcerns associated with the decision\nthey're about to make, right?\n\n393\n00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:56.650\nAnd I think that has a lot to do with it.\n\n394\n00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:58.478\nBut nonetheless, it happens.\n\n395\n00:18:58.478 --> 00:19:02.620\nAnd just what we need to understand as\nincident responders is we may not be there\n\n396\n00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:04.650\nand more often than not, we're not.\n\n397\n00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:05.610\nWe've talked about this, right?\n\n398\n00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:08.591\nWe're typically in the reaction business,\nnot the proaction business.\n\n399\n00:19:08.591 --> 00:19:12.359\nSo if we're not proactively stopping\nyou from shooting yourself in the foot,\n\n400\n00:19:12.359 --> 00:19:16.010\nwe just gotta show up with Band-Aids and\nMercurochrome afterwards.\n\n401\n00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:18.960\nThen we've gotta be prepared\nto deal with the fallout.\n\n402\n00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:22.860\nBecause if you do something that's gonna\nlead to compromise, we have to go in and\n\n403\n00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:23.470\nclean up the mess.\n\n404\n00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:25.170\nI mean, that's what we do, right?\n\n405\n00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:27.417\nWe are the janitors of\nthe IT service community.\n\n406\n00:19:27.417 --> 00:19:28.476\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We clean up, and\n\n407\n00:19:28.476 --> 00:19:29.996\nthat's not a bad thing.\n\n408\n00:19:29.996 --> 00:19:31.366\nAnd I'm not saying that as a joke,\n\n409\n00:19:31.366 --> 00:19:33.689\nI'm not trying to imply that\nas being in any way negative.\n\n410\n00:19:33.689 --> 00:19:35.146\nIt's just the reality.\n\n411\n00:19:35.146 --> 00:19:39.085\nWe are the people that come in behind\nother people that have made a mess and\n\n412\n00:19:39.085 --> 00:19:42.183\nwe have to then clean that back up,\nput it back together,\n\n413\n00:19:42.183 --> 00:19:46.910\nmaintain the environment in the short\nproper operation, that's what we do.\n\n414\n00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:50.280\nAnd so\nthe responders fall into that category.\n\n415\n00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:54.940\nWe often are left at the end of the day\nwith the task of cleaning up and\n\n416\n00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:57.660\nensuring normalcy or return to normalcy.\n\n417\n00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:59.630\nIt's an incredibly important function.\n\n418\n00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:02.930\nBut it's one that unfortunately,\nmore often than not,\n\n419\n00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:07.170\nhas to pick up where people that\nhave made these mistakes leave off.\n\n420\n00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:10.810\nThey go off and say, oops, I'm sorry,\nlet me know when it's back and working.\n\n421\n00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:12.171\nI'm going to be over there\ngetting a cup of coffee.\n\n422\n00:20:12.171 --> 00:20:14.654\nLet me know when things\nare back to normal.\n\n423\n00:20:14.654 --> 00:20:16.490\nThat's part of the challenge.\n\n424\n00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:18.940\nSo that's just something\nwe've got to think about or\n\n425\n00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:20.105\nat least be aware of, anyway.\n\n426\n00:20:20.105 --> 00:20:23.380\nIncident response, we should have\nthis detailed methodical plan.\n\n427\n00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:25.460\nSo what does that detailed\nmethodical plan look like?\n\n428\n00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:29.509\nWell, it's probably important to first of\nall think about the fact that we have some\n\n429\n00:20:29.509 --> 00:20:31.017\ngoals for incident response.\n\n430\n00:20:31.017 --> 00:20:33.745\nWe wanna make sure we're gonna\nhit what this methodical,\n\n431\n00:20:33.745 --> 00:20:38.495\ndetailed plan, that's gonna help us\nensure security of personnel, of assets,\n\n432\n00:20:38.495 --> 00:20:41.465\nof the organization,\nof the infrastructure.\n\n433\n00:20:41.465 --> 00:20:45.017\nCarry out the steps to handle an incident,\ndocument it,\n\n434\n00:20:45.017 --> 00:20:48.267\nreturn to normal,\nmaintain the criminal evidence or\n\n435\n00:20:48.267 --> 00:20:52.187\nthe evidence involved with this incident\nin a forensically sound way and\n\n436\n00:20:52.187 --> 00:20:55.867\nultimately if necessary, lead to\nthe prosecution of the perpetrator.\n\n437\n00:20:55.867 --> 00:20:58.067\nThese are the things incident\nresponse should do but\n\n438\n00:20:58.067 --> 00:20:59.418\nwhat are the goals ultimately?\n\n439\n00:20:59.418 --> 00:21:03.257\nWhat are the line items that we nail and\nlist out?\n\n440\n00:21:03.257 --> 00:21:05.902\nThere are 11 in my mind that I\nthink we should be aware of and\n\n441\n00:21:05.902 --> 00:21:06.679\nwanted to talk about.\n\n442\n00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:10.570\nNumber one, determining whether\nthe incident has occurred or not.\n\n443\n00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:11.575\nDo we actually have an incident?\n\n444\n00:21:11.575 --> 00:21:14.473\nA lot of times,\nwe'll be called on to respond but\n\n445\n00:21:14.473 --> 00:21:17.280\nthe reality is we may\nnot have an incident.\n\n446\n00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:20.990\nThere may not be an incident in our mind,\nbased on our definition as incident\n\n447\n00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:24.890\nresponders even though in the mind of\nthe customer, the mind of the front line\n\n448\n00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:27.645\nprofessional who may have stumbled\nacross this, there maybe.\n\n449\n00:21:27.645 --> 00:21:32.360\nSo we have to decide ultimately, whether\nthere's something worth pursuing, and\n\n450\n00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:38.140\nif there is, we then go through our plan,\nour process, and execute our steps.\n\n451\n00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:40.980\nBut if there isn't, we should stop\nright there, and say okay, thank you,\n\n452\n00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:44.150\nit's always good for you to say something,\nalways wanna come out and check.\n\n453\n00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:46.480\nNever have a problem doing that,\nbut guess what,\n\n454\n00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.910\nthis time, looks like everything's okay,\nnothing here, right?\n\n455\n00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:52.700\nEverybody go back, right, go back to\nwhat you're doing, nothing to look at,\n\n456\n00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:53.790\nright, keep moving.\n\n457\n00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:54.818\nSo there's nothing going on.\n\n458\n00:21:54.818 --> 00:21:59.651\nAnd that in and of itself's important,\nthat sanity check, that logic gate that we\n\n459\n00:21:59.651 --> 00:22:04.210\npass through to say whether or not there\nactually is an incident before we bring\n\n460\n00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:09.060\nout the entire response engine is the\nfirst primary goal of incident response.\n\n461\n00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:12.590\nCuz what we don't wanna have happen\nis spend the time, energy, and\n\n462\n00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:15.370\nresources of the incident\nresponse professionals and\n\n463\n00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:18.248\nteam, chasing those false incidents,\nright?\n\n464\n00:22:18.248 --> 00:22:21.747\nWe don't wanna be off over here dealing\nwith something that really isn't important\n\n465\n00:22:21.747 --> 00:22:22.496\nand functional.\n\n466\n00:22:22.496 --> 00:22:26.747\nWhen over here, there really is a primary\nincident going on, and we're not able to\n\n467\n00:22:26.747 --> 00:22:31.570\nrespond now because we've split our\nattention, and we're centrally distracted.\n\n468\n00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:34.530\nAnd believe it or not,\nthis is actually a hacking methodology\n\n469\n00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:39.360\nat a proven time tested approach that\nthreat sources, bad actors will use.\n\n470\n00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.680\nCreate a diversionary incident somewhere,\nwhere we draw, essentially,\n\n471\n00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:45.720\nthe response mechanisms of\nthe organization over to deal with.\n\n472\n00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.760\nAnd then while they're busy doing that,\n\n473\n00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:51.530\nwe sneak in over here in the back door\nthat we've created, and we go to work.\n\n474\n00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:54.330\nAnd you're not seeing this cuz you're\npaying attention to whatever's going\n\n475\n00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:55.300\non over there.\n\n476\n00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:56.830\nIt's the Wizard of Oz concept,\n\n477\n00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:58.711\npay no attention to the man\nbehind the curtain right?\n\n478\n00:22:58.711 --> 00:22:59.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's not important.\n\n479\n00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:01.720\nWhat's important is the big scary green,\n\n480\n00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.120\nsmokey head that's screaming\nat you in the front here.\n\n481\n00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:08.963\nAnd so if we can distract and we can\ndistort the operational environment as\n\n482\n00:23:08.963 --> 00:23:12.009\na hacker, as a threat source,\nas a bad actor,\n\n483\n00:23:12.009 --> 00:23:16.798\nwe may be able to distract the incident\nresponders and lead them astray.\n\n484\n00:23:16.798 --> 00:23:21.191\nAnd so we have to be very good upfront\nat understanding how to focus on\n\n485\n00:23:21.191 --> 00:23:26.046\nthe reality and get rid of or dispel the\nthings that are gonna get in the way of\n\n486\n00:23:26.046 --> 00:23:30.362\nthat to understand how to tell\nan accurate or be able to identify and\n\n487\n00:23:30.362 --> 00:23:31.857\nbe able to talk about.\n\n488\n00:23:31.857 --> 00:23:35.918\nAnd indeed respond to accurate incidents\nthat legitimately in need of our attention\n\n489\n00:23:35.918 --> 00:23:39.430\nand dispel the rumors around incidents\nthat may or may not be there.\n\n490\n00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:41.220\nSo step number one, the goals.\n\n491\n00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:42.915\nMake sure we understand\nwhat an incident is.\n\n492\n00:23:42.915 --> 00:23:46.185\nNumber two, limit the impact of the\nincident on the business or the network,\n\n493\n00:23:46.185 --> 00:23:46.903\nwhatever it is.\n\n494\n00:23:46.903 --> 00:23:47.681\nIn other words,\n\n495\n00:23:47.681 --> 00:23:51.485\nmitigation needs to be an important\nthought process with regards to a goal.\n\n496\n00:23:51.485 --> 00:23:53.430\nNot just do we have an incident but\nif we do,\n\n497\n00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:57.504\nlet's mitigate it to ensure It's not gonna\nhurt us anymore than absolutely necessary.\n\n498\n00:23:57.504 --> 00:24:02.481\nPrevent future attacks, we need to\nensure that just because you were smart\n\n499\n00:24:02.481 --> 00:24:07.090\nenough to get us today, shame on me\nif you fool me once, right or no.\n\n500\n00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:08.390\n&gt;&gt; Shame on you, yeah.\n\n501\n00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:12.350\n&gt;&gt; Shame on you if you fool me once,\nshame on me if you fool me twice, right?\n\n502\n00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:16.800\nI gotta practice that off camera,\nI had it straight, and then just,\n\n503\n00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.530\nI got turned around, what can I tell you.\n\n504\n00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:21.057\nBut this is what happens when you\ntalk about a million things and\n\n505\n00:24:21.057 --> 00:24:22.923\nyou're wearing a very\nbright colored shirt.\n\n506\n00:24:22.923 --> 00:24:23.450\n&gt;&gt; That's right, it's distracting [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n507\n00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:25.340\nyou can't focus cuz it's distracting.\n\n508\n00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:27.450\nI should have followed your advice and\nworn sunglasses, so\n\n509\n00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:28.760\nI wouldn't have been distracted.\n\n510\n00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:32.300\nAll right, so when we think about shame,\nright, on me or shame on you,\n\n511\n00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:37.190\nwhat we're really talking about is\nthe idea that, as I've said before,\n\n512\n00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:39.730\nyou're gonna have to understand\nas an incident responder\n\n513\n00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:42.720\nthat there are things that are gonna\nhappen yours not gonna stop.\n\n514\n00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:45.540\nBut you have to be prepared\nto then understand them, and\n\n515\n00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:47.690\nprevent them from happening\nagain the next time.\n\n516\n00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:50.770\nBecause we cannot,\nunder any circumstances,\n\n517\n00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:55.760\nsee repetition of these events occurring,\nif there's a legitimate way to diagnose,\n\n518\n00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:59.460\nunderstand and mitigate them,\nthat is our primary responsibility.\n\n519\n00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:04.030\nWe talk about due care and due diligence,\nand you hear me use these terms.\n\n520\n00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:08.940\nThe idea of due care is the idea of\nunderstanding how to apply the proper\n\n521\n00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:15.280\nprocedures, the proper policy, the proper\nthought process to daily operations,\n\n522\n00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:18.660\nto ensure that the things we do,\ndon't lead to negative outcomes but\n\n523\n00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:21.600\nrather lead to the reinforcement\nof positive behavior.\n\n524\n00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:26.630\nDue diligence is the oversight associated\nwith that, to ensure that we're managing\n\n525\n00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:30.140\neverybody to do those things, and\nthen when we see risks occurring\n\n526\n00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:34.110\nwe try to move immediately to put\nresources in place to mitigate them.\n\n527\n00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:37.290\nWe have to understand that both these\nconcepts are critical to what we do,\n\n528\n00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:41.060\nbecause without due care and due diligence\nthere's no way for us to reinforce\n\n529\n00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:45.230\nthe fact that if something does happen we\nhave to take steps to document it, and\n\n530\n00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:48.180\nultimately mitigate it so\nit doesn't re-occur.\n\n531\n00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:50.320\nAnd if we're not successful at doing that,\n\n532\n00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:53.790\nwe've got to continuously\niterate until we are successful.\n\n533\n00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:55.730\nThis is the methodology\nwe need to think about.\n\n534\n00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:59.780\nSo, determining whether incidents have\noccurred, limiting the impact, and\n\n535\n00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:02.750\npresenting future repetition\nare all important goals.\n\n536\n00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:05.450\nWhat about supporting communication\nof accurate information?\n\n537\n00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:08.390\nGot to be able to have bi-lateral,\nbi-directional,\n\n538\n00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:12.170\nup and down, the management and\nacross the organizational chain for\n\n539\n00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:16.120\ncommunication but direct, clear and\nunequivocal communication.\n\n540\n00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:18.490\nSo important to what we do, right?\n\n541\n00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:21.468\nIf we're not communicating in\na way that everybody understands,\n\n542\n00:26:21.468 --> 00:26:25.031\nhow could we possibly expect everybody\nto walk away with the same outcomes, and\n\n543\n00:26:25.031 --> 00:26:28.405\nthe same results, and the same thought\nprocess about what they need to do.\n\n544\n00:26:28.405 --> 00:26:30.770\nThis comes back to the idea of\ntraining and awareness, right?\n\n545\n00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:33.860\nEverybody's responsibility in\nthe organization no matter what they do,\n\n546\n00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:37.800\nis to play a part of the overall security\nposture of the organization, and\n\n547\n00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:40.320\nto positively reinforce\nthat through their actions,\n\n548\n00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:42.850\ntheir words and their deeds, very,\nvery important to think about that.\n\n549\n00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:48.190\nNumber five, create guidelines and\ncontrol measures that will allow us to\n\n550\n00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:53.050\nproperly handle evidence, recover from\nthe incident, and ensure the forensic\n\n551\n00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:57.200\nhandling and sound application\nforensic principles to that evidence.\n\n552\n00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:00.790\nSo, we gotta make sure that when\nsomebody shows up and says, my god,\n\n553\n00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:02.790\nthere's a computer\nthat's been compromised.\n\n554\n00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:06.760\nLet me try to isolate that computer, and\nthey start unplugging stuff left and\n\n555\n00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.110\nright, and turning things off,\n\n556\n00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:10.460\nthat's not the forensically\nsound way to deal with things.\n\n557\n00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:12.610\nWe'll talk about it,\nsome upcoming episodes,\n\n558\n00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:16.300\nwhat would be the forensically sound way,\nbut just rest assured that\n\n559\n00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:19.540\nI can promise that that's not the\nappropriate way to deal with that, right?\n\n560\n00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:22.970\nAnd so as a result, we need to\nensure that people understand that.\n\n561\n00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:27.523\nSo here's a little scenario, right,\nshould an average information worker, you,\n\n562\n00:27:27.523 --> 00:27:31.950\nmyself, Daniel, anybody who just plays\nthe role of a normal, average employee in\n\n563\n00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:35.808\na business, not a security professional,\nnot an instrument handler,\n\n564\n00:27:35.808 --> 00:27:39.223\njust anybody that you could think\nof that you work with that may or\n\n565\n00:27:39.223 --> 00:27:42.040\nmay not have any special\nknowledge of these things.\n\n566\n00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:45.981\nShould they be given some general\ntraining, guidance, awareness,\n\n567\n00:27:45.981 --> 00:27:49.855\ninformation, that allows them not\nto become an incident handler but\n\n568\n00:27:49.855 --> 00:27:53.858\nto understand what not to do, and\nwhat to do, in order to facilitate and\n\n569\n00:27:53.858 --> 00:27:56.860\nsome handling being done successfully?\n\n570\n00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:57.887\nYou should be shaking your heads,\nit's absolutely, right?\n\n571\n00:27:57.887 --> 00:28:00.342\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI thought it was a rhetorical question.\n\n572\n00:28:00.342 --> 00:28:02.160\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, it is, but\n\n573\n00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.010\nI want everybody out there to ponder it.\n\n574\n00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:07.700\nSo that's why I'm saying you should\nunderstand the value of this, right?\n\n575\n00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:09.690\nWhat I'm suggesting is basic\nsecurity awareness and\n\n576\n00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:14.140\ntraining, with regards to even the most\nentry level positions in business,\n\n577\n00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:16.810\nshould incorporate things like\nsee something, say something.\n\n578\n00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:20.380\nWe've talked about this thought process\nbefore, something unusual is occurring.\n\n579\n00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:23.380\nLet me not become a superhero and\ntry to figure it out myself.\n\n580\n00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:26.420\nLet me call the people that\nknow how to deal with this, and\n\n581\n00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:29.270\nlet me be a superhero by informing them,\nand\n\n582\n00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:33.890\nletting them do their job, right, that's\nwhat I tell my customers and my students.\n\n583\n00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:35.390\nEverybody is a superhero, right?\n\n584\n00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:36.852\nEverybody gets an award, right?\n\n585\n00:28:36.852 --> 00:28:38.570\nEverybody gets a trophy, right?\n\n586\n00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:42.677\nEverybody's a superhero but everybody\nhas special powers, and your powers as\n\n587\n00:28:42.677 --> 00:28:46.291\nan average, general employee in\na business your superhero power is to\n\n588\n00:28:46.291 --> 00:28:51.010\nbe able to identify there's something\nwrong, and call for the cavalry, right?\n\n589\n00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:54.250\nThat's all we want you to do,\nwe don't want you to solve the problem,\n\n590\n00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:58.000\nwe don't want you to go ahead and\nstart trying to reconfigure the system\n\n591\n00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.060\nbecause that's not your superpower,\nit's not what you're good at.\n\n592\n00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:04.280\nYou're good at sounding the alarm, and\ngetting the people that know how to\n\n593\n00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.690\ndeal with it to come and\npay attention to you, right?\n\n594\n00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:09.810\nAnd if you understand that and\ncan communicate that effectively\n\n595\n00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:14.520\nto everybody in the organization,\nthen you are a superhero, right?\n\n596\n00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.020\n&gt;&gt; Amen.\n&gt;&gt; Put on your cape and your mask,\n\n597\n00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:21.400\nit's what we need the background or have\nthe fan, and the cape's flowing, right?\n\n598\n00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.293\n&gt;&gt; The music of triumph, yeah.\n\n599\n00:29:23.293 --> 00:29:25.421\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I could do one of these,\nI just saw Dr.\n\n600\n00:29:25.421 --> 00:29:27.950\nStrange on the plane when\nI was flying back in.\n\n601\n00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:32.835\nAnd again, see, I love that movie,\nand the cape of levitation, right?\n\n602\n00:29:32.835 --> 00:29:33.750\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n603\n00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:36.870\n&gt;&gt; It likes you, that line where the guy\nis like, yeah, it likes you, and\n\n604\n00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:39.540\nit's hitting him in the face,\nthe part where he's like, stop that.\n\n605\n00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:42.150\nHe's talking to the cape,\nBenedict Cumberbatch, I love that movie,\n\n606\n00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:43.080\nit's a great movie.\n\n607\n00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.670\nProbably one of the better\nones Marvel's done.\n\n608\n00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:45.290\n&gt;&gt; I haven't seen it yet.\n\n609\n00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:46.314\n&gt;&gt; You haven't, bro,\nyou gotta see it, it's really cool.\n\n610\n00:29:46.314 --> 00:29:48.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's on my list,\nyeah, it's on my list [LAUGH].\n\n611\n00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.966\n&gt;&gt; This is a random aside from movie talk,\nby the way.\n\n612\n00:29:50.966 --> 00:29:52.480\n&gt;&gt; We do love our movie talk.\n&gt;&gt; We should label this instead of\n\n613\n00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.260\nhandling the movies.\n\n614\n00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:54.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Right, that would be the win.\n\n615\n00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:57.650\nBut if you have not seen it,\nit is a really good movie,\n\n616\n00:29:57.650 --> 00:29:58.820\nyou definitely should see it.\n\n617\n00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:01.340\nAnd by the way, just so you know, and\nif you, I'm not gonna spoil it for\n\n618\n00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:04.028\nanybody who hasn't seen it, but just so\nyou know with a lot of these movies,\n\n619\n00:30:04.028 --> 00:30:05.507\nyou probably seen somebody you may know.\n\n620\n00:30:05.507 --> 00:30:09.058\nBut if you haven't seen it when you do\nwatch it stay through to the absolute,\n\n621\n00:30:09.058 --> 00:30:10.346\nabsolute, absolute end.\n\n622\n00:30:10.346 --> 00:30:13.229\nAnd if you watch it at home because\nthere's stuff that happens when\n\n623\n00:30:13.229 --> 00:30:14.773\nthe credits are rolling at the end,\n\n624\n00:30:14.773 --> 00:30:18.065\nthat you would normally if you're in\nthe movie you get up and walk out you miss\n\n625\n00:30:18.065 --> 00:30:21.616\nsome of the best stuff in the entire movie\nhappens after the credits are rolling and\n\n626\n00:30:21.616 --> 00:30:24.800\nthese small vignettes that they\npop up randomly out of nowhere.\n\n627\n00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:28.132\nSo you gotta make sure you watch the whole\nthing without spoiling it for anybody,\n\n628\n00:30:28.132 --> 00:30:30.340\nyou gotta watch the whole thing,\nit's really cool.\n\n629\n00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:33.406\nAll right, so we've got the idea of the\nfirst five, we're creating guidelines, and\n\n630\n00:30:33.406 --> 00:30:34.405\ncontrol measures.\n\n631\n00:30:34.405 --> 00:30:37.865\nOn number six, safeguarding privacy rights\nrecognized either through policy or\n\n632\n00:30:37.865 --> 00:30:40.448\nlaw, where we gotta\nensure confidentiality,\n\n633\n00:30:40.448 --> 00:30:44.982\ngotta ensure that our response\ncreates the opportunity for\n\n634\n00:30:44.982 --> 00:30:48.802\nconfidentiality to continue to be applied\nto information that must be protected.\n\n635\n00:30:48.802 --> 00:30:52.847\nWhether we're talking about PII,\nPersonally Identifiable Information,\n\n636\n00:30:52.847 --> 00:30:56.950\nP-I-I as an acronym, or\nwe're talking about just,\n\n637\n00:30:56.950 --> 00:31:01.170\nindustrial information or some sort of\na proprietary IP intellectual property,\n\n638\n00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:02.860\nwhatever it is in the organization.\n\n639\n00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:06.850\nIf it's medical records, if it's account\ninformation, doesn't matter what it is,\n\n640\n00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:11.100\nit all is in need of protection at\nsome level, and has to be protected.\n\n641\n00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:14.935\nAnd we have to ensure that as part of\nincident handling, what we can't allow to\n\n642\n00:31:14.935 --> 00:31:19.630\nhappen is that incident handling exposes\nthe very information that we're normally\n\n643\n00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:23.500\ndesigning our systems to protect as\npart of the response if we can avoid it.\n\n644\n00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:27.570\nI'm not saying that that may not happen,\nand I'm not saying the response may not\n\n645\n00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:32.590\ninvolve extraordinary steps that may\nlead to things getting worse before\n\n646\n00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:36.100\nthey get better because of the nature\nof the incident, these things do occur.\n\n647\n00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:39.640\nThe other catastrophic system failure,\nthe reality is you may have to take\n\n648\n00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:41.670\na extraordinary step to\nbring everything back.\n\n649\n00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:45.490\nAnd in the mean time, you may lead things\nthat are not in a compromise state in\n\n650\n00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:48.230\norder to do that, I get that,\nright, that's the reality.\n\n651\n00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:51.912\nWhat I'm suggesting to you is,\nthough, that, if at all possible,\n\n652\n00:31:51.912 --> 00:31:54.331\nwe take steps to minimize\nthe impact of that.\n\n653\n00:31:54.331 --> 00:31:58.558\nAnd we try to maximize confidentiality\nprotections with regards to personally\n\n654\n00:31:58.558 --> 00:32:01.719\nidentifiable, or\nany kind Of confidential information.\n\n655\n00:32:01.719 --> 00:32:05.739\nIdentify illegal activities and\ntake actions necessary to make sure we can\n\n656\n00:32:05.739 --> 00:32:08.750\nprosecute the perpetrators\nif at all possible.\n\n657\n00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:12.860\nProvide useful information and\nrecommendations to senior leaders and\n\n658\n00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:17.320\nmanagers in the business, so they can\naccurately make decisions that will\n\n659\n00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:19.890\nlead to the minimization\nof risk going forward.\n\n660\n00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:23.100\nSo when someone says, hey,\nbased on what happened, what should we do?\n\n661\n00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:24.372\nWhat are our options?\n\n662\n00:32:24.372 --> 00:32:26.914\nYou wanna be there prepared to talk\nknowledgeably about what you could do\n\n663\n00:32:26.914 --> 00:32:27.757\ndifferently, right?\n\n664\n00:32:27.757 --> 00:32:30.387\nSo that's gonna be a part of\nthe responsibility, it's number 8.\n\n665\n00:32:30.387 --> 00:32:35.540\nNumber 9, Swift detection, reporting, and\ncontainment, and recovery of an incident.\n\n666\n00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:38.850\nIn other words, as we said,\nminimize risks, minimize impact,\n\n667\n00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:42.330\nminimize negative outcome,\nmaximize restorability and\n\n668\n00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:45.610\nmaximize return to normalcy so\nthat we can get back to work.\n\n669\n00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:48.840\nNumber 9, number 10, limit the exposure\nand compromise the business data,\n\n670\n00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:49.900\nwe talked about that.\n\n671\n00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:53.100\nAnd number 11, secure the organization's\nreputation and assets.\n\n672\n00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:55.920\nMake sure that the damage is minimal, but\n\n673\n00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:59.860\nmake sure that customers maintain\nfaith and reliability in the business.\n\n674\n00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:03.040\nAnd that they understand that,\nwhile we all make mistakes,\n\n675\n00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.110\nwe're gonna do our best to ensure\nthat we don't make them again.\n\n676\n00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:08.600\nThis is obviously gonna be very important\nfor us to think about and we need\n\n677\n00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:13.125\nan incident response plan that helps us to\naddress these issues and these concerns.\n\n678\n00:33:13.125 --> 00:33:16.500\nAnd the incident response\nplan is ultimately gonna be,\n\n679\n00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:20.860\nyou have a set of instructions that\nwe are gonna roll out and follow.\n\n680\n00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:22.500\nI think of it as the IKEA model, right?\n\n681\n00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:26.110\nBecause if you ever put together a piece\nof IKEA furniture you know, they've\n\n682\n00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:29.000\ngot the little booklet in there, the\nlittle stick figure, and the furniture.\n\n683\n00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.290\nNo matter what, I always manage to\nput the thing together backwards,\n\n684\n00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:33.580\nno matter how hard I try to get it right.\n\n685\n00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:36.690\nI'm one of those people that's\nnot wired for that stuff.\n\n686\n00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:39.400\nI can do a lot of things really well.\n\n687\n00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:41.920\nI'm not wired to putting together\nfurniture when it comes out of a box,\n\n688\n00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:42.590\nit's just not me.\n\n689\n00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:46.210\nBut, you know, I've learned something\nabout myself as a result of doing this.\n\n690\n00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:49.440\nBecause I've learned as I've gotten\nolder that it's okay to admit you can't\n\n691\n00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:53.230\ndo things and get other people to do\nthem if they're willing to help you.\n\n692\n00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:54.900\nBecause that's okay, right?\n\n693\n00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:58.340\nSo I got out of that, hey I could do it\nall phase and I realized it's okay for\n\n694\n00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:02.590\nme to say, hey would you mind helping me\ndo that and by the way here's some cash.\n\n695\n00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:04.635\nJust make sure you do it well, right?\n\n696\n00:34:04.635 --> 00:34:06.971\nSo now my kids are in charge of\nputting their own furniture,\n\n697\n00:34:06.971 --> 00:34:08.151\nworks out a lot better for me.\n\n698\n00:34:08.151 --> 00:34:09.446\nAnd, I' happy.\n\n699\n00:34:09.446 --> 00:34:10.596\n&gt;&gt; They get extra Starbucks money.\n\n700\n00:34:10.596 --> 00:34:13.970\n&gt;&gt; And they get extra Starbucks money, so\nit works out well for everybody [LAUGH].\n\n701\n00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:14.890\nSo the incident plan,\n\n702\n00:34:14.890 --> 00:34:17.850\nthe thing I just wanna stress as we\nwrap up this particular conversation.\n\n703\n00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:21.780\nThe incident plan is like that set\nof instructions, it's the guideline.\n\n704\n00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:25.014\nBut here's the thing, is there one set\nof instructions that IKEA puts out for\n\n705\n00:34:25.014 --> 00:34:27.174\nevery piece of furniture\nregardless of what it is?\n\n706\n00:34:27.174 --> 00:34:30.425\nTo me it looks like there is because I\nalways get it wrong regardless but no,\n\n707\n00:34:30.425 --> 00:34:32.350\nwe know hopefully, you know, right?\n\n708\n00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:34.280\nThat there is more than\none set of instructions.\n\n709\n00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:37.280\nAs a matter of fact, there's uniquely\ntailored set of instructions for\n\n710\n00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.810\nevery kind of furniture you buy.\n\n711\n00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:40.690\nOr ever kind of product,\nwhatever it is, right?\n\n712\n00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:45.140\nA chair gets put together differently\nthan a credenza, or a table, or a desk.\n\n713\n00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:49.420\nAnd as a result, you need different\nplans to address different products.\n\n714\n00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:50.810\nSame thought process here.\n\n715\n00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:52.650\nAre all incidents the same?\n\n716\n00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:53.920\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; That was not rhetorical, so\n\n717\n00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:54.815\nI'm glad you answered that.\n\n718\n00:34:54.815 --> 00:34:56.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Are all incidents the same?\n\n719\n00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:56.830\nAbsolutely not.\n\n720\n00:34:56.830 --> 00:34:59.480\nShould all incident\nresponse plans be the same?\n\n721\n00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.780\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely not, right.\n\n722\n00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:02.715\nI could do this all day.\n\n723\n00:35:02.715 --> 00:35:03.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No.\n&gt;&gt; Just go like this, and\n\n724\n00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:04.430\nwe hear no, right.\n\n725\n00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:07.630\nSo, incident response\nplans must be tailored\n\n726\n00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:09.780\nto the specificity of the incident.\n\n727\n00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:12.696\nNow this is a challenge,\nbecause pulling them off the shelf,\n\n728\n00:35:12.696 --> 00:35:16.456\nthey're not always gonna be tailored\nspecifically to the needs of the business\n\n729\n00:35:16.456 --> 00:35:18.042\nat the time the incident occurs.\n\n730\n00:35:18.042 --> 00:35:23.124\nWhat you need is a general thought\nprocess, and a set of guidelines,\n\n731\n00:35:23.124 --> 00:35:28.382\nand broad parameters that can be used\nto channel and control response,\n\n732\n00:35:28.382 --> 00:35:32.781\nand then tailor them as you go\nto the needs and specificity.\n\n733\n00:35:32.781 --> 00:35:36.137\nTry saying that three times fast,\nthe needs and specificity of\n\n734\n00:35:36.137 --> 00:35:40.030\nthe particular circumstances you\nfind yourself responding to.\n\n735\n00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:41.170\nVery important thought process.\n\n736\n00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:44.550\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, incident response\nis definitely a huge apple for\n\n737\n00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:45.710\nus to take a bite out of.\n\n738\n00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:48.630\nAnd we were unable to do\nit in this one episode.\n\n739\n00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:50.710\nSo we're definitely gonna\nhave to move on to another.\n\n740\n00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:53.310\nAdam we look forward to meeting you there\nand hearing what you have to say about\n\n741\n00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:56.570\nthat very topic, hopefully you\ngood folks will join us as well.\n\n742\n00:35:56.570 --> 00:36:00.100\nThat being said it looks like it is\ntime for us to sign off, for ITPro TV,\n\n743\n00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:02.320\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n744\n00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:02.900\n&gt;&gt; I am, who am I?\n\n745\n00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:04.780\n&gt;&gt; You're an incident response.\n\n746\n00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:06.150\n&gt;&gt; I thought I was a superhero.\n\n747\n00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:08.855\nI'm bright guy, that's me.\n\n748\n00:36:08.855 --> 00:36:10.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We'll see you next time.\n\n749\n00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:13.115\n&gt;&gt; Take care everybody.\n\n750\n00:36:13.115 -->

00:00:17.540\neveryone, and welcome to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.818\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n8\n00:00:19.818 --> 00:00:24.250\nin this episode we are continuing\non with more on our ECIH series.\n\n9\n00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.210\nAnd, of course,\njoining us back in the studio yet\n\n10\n00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.100\nagain, our good friend Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.250\nAdam, welcome back, sir.\n\n12\n00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.170\nHow goes it today?\n\n13\n00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.764\n&gt;&gt; Howdy.\n\n14\n00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:32.078\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not just how-\n\n15\n00:00:32.078 --> 00:00:32.706\n&gt;&gt; How do.\n\n16\n00:00:32.706 --> 00:00:35.380\n&gt;&gt; But howdy, how do, howdy, how about.\n\n17\n00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Cover it all.\n\n18\n00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.389\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's talk a little bit about, or\n\n19\n00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:44.070\na little bit more, I should say, about\nincident handling, incident response.\n\n20\n00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.502\nWe're gonna continue our conversation.\n\n21\n00:00:45.502 --> 00:00:48.243\nJust reminding you,\nif you have not seen the prior episode,\n\n22\n00:00:48.243 --> 00:00:51.683\ndefinitely important for you to take\na look at that before we jump in here only\n\n23\n00:00:51.683 --> 00:00:54.883\ncuz you'll kinda miss the thread\nof the conversation we're having.\n\n24\n00:00:54.883 --> 00:00:58.069\nAnd it may not make as much sense to you\nbased on what we're about to jump into and\n\n25\n00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:59.150\ncontinue talking about.\n\n26\n00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.410\nSo we left off talking about\nthe incident response plan, why it's so\n\n27\n00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.668\nimportant, what the goals are, why we have\nto do the things we do, reasons behind it,\n\n28\n00:01:06.668 --> 00:01:07.840\nthe motivation.\n\n29\n00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.330\nWho executes on that plan,\nreally is the next question, and\n\n30\n00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.798\nthat execution of the plan is left\nto the incident response team.\n\n31\n00:01:13.798 --> 00:01:17.621\nAnd the incident response team is a group\nof very talented individuals made up of\n\n32\n00:01:17.621 --> 00:01:21.046\ndifferent areas of the company\nrepresenting different disciplines,\n\n33\n00:01:21.046 --> 00:01:22.543\nhaving different knowledge.\n\n34\n00:01:22.543 --> 00:01:26.645\nAll brought together so that they can be\nthe experts that will ultimately go out\n\n35\n00:01:26.645 --> 00:01:30.010\nand figure out how to respond\nto whatever's happening.\n\n36\n00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.070\nYou know, I think back,\nwe often talk about movies and TV shows,\n\n37\n00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.060\nthings like that.\n\n38\n00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.734\nI think back to Mission Impossible,\nthe original series,\n\n39\n00:01:36.734 --> 00:01:40.531\nthe TV series from the 1960s, because\nyou don’t really see this in the movies,\n\n40\n00:01:40.531 --> 00:01:43.010\nthe newer movies,\nthey don’t just do it the same way.\n\n41\n00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.946\nBut in the old TV series, if you remember,\nPeter Graves was Mr. Phelps,\n\n42\n00:01:47.946 --> 00:01:52.733\nand you had Martin Landau and\nBarbara Bain, his wife, and everybody.\n\n43\n00:01:52.733 --> 00:01:54.430\nIt was a great show, right?\n\n44\n00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.390\nAnd you would see in the beginning,\nhe would go out, and Mr.\n\n45\n00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.500\nPhelps, the character who\nkinda coordinates and\n\n46\n00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.820\nplays the incident manager role,\nincident coordinator role for the team.\n\n47\n00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.540\nHe would go out, get his marching orders,\nsomewhere in the middle of nowhere, and\n\n48\n00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.910\nthen magically afterwards be\ntransported back to the cool,\n\n49\n00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.200\nhip, 60s bachelor pad somewhere,\nright, in the penthouse.\n\n50\n00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.870\nAnd he'd be sitting around figuring\nout who was gonna, essentially,\n\n51\n00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.730\nplay a part in that week's episode and\nbe on the incident team.\n\n52\n00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.820\nAnd he would go through the portfolio\nof all the pictures, of all the people.\n\n53\n00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.637\nAnd he'd throw the pictures of\nthe people on the desk, or on the table.\n\n54\n00:02:30.637 --> 00:02:34.298\nAnd then the next thing you know,\nthey would be in the room meeting,\n\n55\n00:02:34.298 --> 00:02:37.833\ntalking about the plan and\nhow they’re going to essentially take\n\n56\n00:02:37.833 --> 00:02:40.749\non the villain or\nwhoever the subject of the show was.\n\n57\n00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:42.365\nAnd forming that team,\n\n58\n00:02:42.365 --> 00:02:46.095\nchoosing your experts based on\nthe requirements of the mission\n\n59\n00:02:46.095 --> 00:02:49.515\nis really what the incident response team\nis designed to help you to accomplish.\n\n60\n00:02:49.515 --> 00:02:50.835\nIt’s an incident handler.\n\n61\n00:02:50.835 --> 00:02:53.725\nAre you gonna have the same people on\nthe incident response team all the time?\n\n62\n00:02:53.725 --> 00:02:56.809\nYou may have a core group of people\nthat are just gonna always be there.\n\n63\n00:02:56.809 --> 00:03:01.795\nBut can an incident response team be\nphysical, everybody's in the same place?\n\n64\n00:03:01.795 --> 00:03:03.010\nSure, absolutely.\n\n65\n00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.190\nCan it be virtual,\ncan you have people that call in and\n\n66\n00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.570\nare experts on demand that you\nwill just access as needed?\n\n67\n00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.160\nOf course.\nCan it be a hybrid where you have\n\n68\n00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.478\nthe elements of both?\n\n69\n00:03:12.478 --> 00:03:15.110\nCertain people that are there\npresent physically all the time,\n\n70\n00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.500\nothers that are remote and\nmaybe on demand?\n\n71\n00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.040\nAbsolutely.\nToday, there really isn't a right or\n\n72\n00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.550\nwrong way to do this.\n\n73\n00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.650\nThe only wrong thing about\nforming an incident response team\n\n74\n00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.390\nis not incorporating the necessary skills\nrequired to respond to the incidents.\n\n75\n00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.955\nAnd not understanding that all areas of\nthe company need to have representation in\n\n76\n00:03:33.955 --> 00:03:35.952\nthe incident resolution process.\n\n77\n00:03:35.952 --> 00:03:38.950\nThey need to be communicated with,\nthey need to be represented.\n\n78\n00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.200\nAnd if the incident involves\nthat aspect of the business,\n\n79\n00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.910\nyou need to have people that understand it\nas being the leads and the experts that\n\n80\n00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.450\nwill help you to deal with, minimize,\nand ultimately address the concerns.\n\n81\n00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.120\nIf somebody attacks the HR,\nthe financial services, and\n\n82\n00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.330\nreporting systems, you don't want the\nperson that is answering the phones for\n\n83\n00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.280\nthe business being the lead on\nthe incident response team.\n\n84\n00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.260\nNot because they're not gonna add\nsomething of value, quite the opposite.\n\n85\n00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.600\nThey're gonna give us valuable insight\ninto things, but their area of expertise\n\n86\n00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.040\nis not gonna be in the area where those\nsystems that are being affected lies.\n\n87\n00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.006\nAnd as a result, they may not be the most\nappropriate choice to be on that team,\n\n88\n00:04:18.006 --> 00:04:19.752\ngiven the circumstances.\n\n89\n00:04:19.752 --> 00:04:22.202\nOr as Daniel's reminded\nus in other episodes,\n\n90\n00:04:22.202 --> 00:04:25.370\nthe context of the incident\nthat we're addressing.\n\n91\n00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.471\nAnd so we need to understand as we start\nthis conversation that incident response\n\n92\n00:04:29.471 --> 00:04:32.063\nteams have to be generated,\nhave to be populated,\n\n93\n00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:35.834\nbased on the contextual needs of\nthe incident that we're responding to.\n\n94\n00:04:35.834 --> 00:04:38.540\nIt's a very important thought\nprocess when you think about it.\n\n95\n00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.410\nTo that end, we have incident response\nhandling steps that we identify,\n\n96\n00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.240\nthat we have documented and that we should\nin our incident response manifesto,\n\n97\n00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.370\nour plan, and our guides that we share\nwith everybody, have detailed out.\n\n98\n00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.885\nThere's traditionally 17 steps\nthat we outline and highlight.\n\n99\n00:04:55.885 --> 00:04:59.260\nWanna share them with you, if we can,\nusing my, let me try that one more time.\n\n100\n00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.432\nIf we can-\n&gt;&gt; Look at that, that was perfect.\n\n101\n00:05:01.432 --> 00:05:03.765\n&gt;&gt; Actually, it would be great if\nI could do like one of these, and\n\n102\n00:05:03.765 --> 00:05:05.064\nit would show up because-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n103\n00:05:05.064 --> 00:05:06.337\n&gt;&gt; Start coming from the top down and\n\n104\n00:05:06.337 --> 00:05:09.890\njust pop up off to the side, but that's a\nwhole other conversation for another time.\n\n105\n00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.230\nSo let's just quickly take a look.\n\n106\n00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.615\nI thought, since there are so many steps\ninvolved in the process, that I would at\n\n107\n00:05:15.615 --> 00:05:19.405\nleast put a list together for\nyou on the screen, quickly highlight them.\n\n108\n00:05:19.405 --> 00:05:21.155\nWe're gonna have an in-depth\nconversation around them,\n\n109\n00:05:21.155 --> 00:05:22.635\ngo through them in the next few minutes.\n\n110\n00:05:22.635 --> 00:05:25.985\nBut this way, you could see what we're\nreferring to as we talk about them,\n\n111\n00:05:25.985 --> 00:05:28.895\ninstead of just trying to keep them all\nstraight in your head when I rattle five\n\n112\n00:05:28.895 --> 00:05:30.995\nor ten of them off all at once.\n\n113\n00:05:30.995 --> 00:05:33.425\nThey are obviously gonna be\ncaptured in the show notes.\n\n114\n00:05:33.425 --> 00:05:34.960\nYou'll have an authoritative list.\n\n115\n00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.410\nDaniel's gonna keep me honest about that,\n\n116\n00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.860\nand he's also gonna spell check, just in\ncase I missed anything along the way.\n\n117\n00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.660\nSo Incident Response/Handling Steps.\n\n118\n00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.860\nYou could see we start off at\nthe top with Identification.\n\n119\n00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.880\nUnderstanding what it is,\ndo we have an incident?\n\n120\n00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.079\nIf we do have an incident,\nwhat kind of incident?\n\n121\n00:05:51.079 --> 00:05:53.337\nWe've talked about that and\nwhy that's important.\n\n122\n00:05:53.337 --> 00:05:55.937\nIncident Recording, Initial Response,\n\n123\n00:05:55.937 --> 00:06:00.290\ncommunicating the incident to all\nthe people that may be affected.\n\n124\n00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.990\nContainment, building those barriers\nthat are gonna isolate the systems, and\n\n125\n00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.350\nas a result, allow us to minimize\nthe damage, or minimize the impact.\n\n126\n00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.020\nFormulating a Response Strategy.\n\n127\n00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.799\nWhat are we gonna do?\n\n128\n00:06:11.799 --> 00:06:12.660\nHow are we gonna do it?\n\n129\n00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:13.600\nWhen am I gonna do it?\n\n130\n00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.740\nWhere are we gonna do it?\n\n131\n00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.350\nWe're gonna answer those questions.\n\n132\n00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:20.620\nAnd remember, we're gonna take the general\nresponse thought-process off the shelf.\n\n133\n00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.923\nBut then we have to tailor it,\nwe have to scope and tailor.\n\n134\n00:06:22.923 --> 00:06:27.248\nEssentially, narrowly focus it in to\nensure that the things that we're gonna do\n\n135\n00:06:27.248 --> 00:06:29.729\nare gonna make sense,\ngiven the parameters,\n\n136\n00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:33.720\ngiven the context of the situation\nwe find ourselves addressing.\n\n137\n00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.160\nIncident Classification.\n\n138\n00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.980\nGotta know what kinda\nincident we're dealing with.\n\n139\n00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:42.330\nIs it a threat actor, a threat source,\na bad actor of some kind that's hacked in?\n\n140\n00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.440\nIs it a self-inflicted wound?\n\n141\n00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.830\nIs it a vulnerability based\non a misconfiguration?\n\n142\n00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.690\nIs it a bad piece of software that's\nmade its way into the system?\n\n143\n00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:51.860\nThere's all these possibilities.\n\n144\n00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.770\nWe've gotta understand what it is.\n\n145\n00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:54.940\nIncident Investigation.\n\n146\n00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.420\nWe gotta start poking around,\n\n147\n00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.390\nstart figuring out what it is we're\ndoing and how we're going to address it.\n\n148\n00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:04.846\nData Collection, come up with and\nunderstand how to gather all the pieces of\n\n149\n00:07:04.846 --> 00:07:09.161\ninformation and evidence that may be\nvaluable to help us tell the story and\n\n150\n00:07:09.161 --> 00:07:13.356\nultimately, understand how to\nrespond to this particular incident.\n\n151\n00:07:13.356 --> 00:07:16.439\nForensic Analysis, gotta accurately, and\n\n152\n00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:20.169\nwith a very specific set of procedures and\npolicies and\n\n153\n00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:25.293\nmethodical steps in mind, address\nthe evidence that we find and collect.\n\n154\n00:07:25.293 --> 00:07:29.131\nAnd Data Collection, number 9,\nForensic Analysis, number 10,\n\n155\n00:07:29.131 --> 00:07:33.555\nEvidence Protection, number 11,\nall go together under the general header,\n\n156\n00:07:33.555 --> 00:07:37.543\nthe general banner, general thought\nprocess of forensic procedures.\n\n157\n00:07:37.543 --> 00:07:42.513\nAnd forensic investigative procedures are\nused to be able to accurately identify,\n\n158\n00:07:42.513 --> 00:07:47.133\ncollect, document, and then work with and\nprotect that evidence throughout\n\n159\n00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:51.410\nthe life cycle, or the chain of custody,\nthat we will often talk about.\n\n160\n00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:52.600\nSo we have all that.\n\n161\n00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:58.202\nNotification of External Agencies If\nnecessary and appropriate.\n\n162\n00:07:58.202 --> 00:07:59.900\nIf they can add value.\n\n163\n00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.285\nIf they need to be notified because\nof policy or regulatory compliance.\n\n164\n00:08:03.285 --> 00:08:05.780\nAnd/or because they can.\n\n165\n00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:06.529\nHello.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n166\n00:08:06.529 --> 00:08:08.019\n&gt;&gt; And/or because they can.\n\n167\n00:08:08.019 --> 00:08:10.705\nHey look, everybody deserves\na rest at a certain point in time.\n\n168\n00:08:10.705 --> 00:08:13.567\nMy machine just decided it was\ngonna take one right now, right?\n\n169\n00:08:13.567 --> 00:08:16.421\nThat's what you get for not moving the\nmouse around when the screen goes dark.\n\n170\n00:08:16.421 --> 00:08:20.749\nSo, Notifying External Agencies,\nif they can add value.\n\n171\n00:08:20.749 --> 00:08:21.850\nVery important to think about that.\n\n172\n00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:25.287\nSo, for instance,\nwould you notify the FBI?\n\n173\n00:08:25.287 --> 00:08:27.590\nWould you notify local law enforcement?\n\n174\n00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:33.670\nWould you notify a US cert or some sort of\ncert based on whatever country you're in?\n\n175\n00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:38.246\nWould you notify another agency\nthat may be able to help?\n\n176\n00:08:38.246 --> 00:08:39.870\nThe answer is yes or no.\n\n177\n00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:40.931\nIt's hard to say.\n\n178\n00:08:40.931 --> 00:08:44.650\nIt would depend partially on the policies\nyou have in place in the business.\n\n179\n00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.843\nIt would depend partially on,\nas I said, the legalities and\n\n180\n00:08:47.843 --> 00:08:52.619\nthe regulatory issues associated with that\nbreak-in or that incident, whatever it is.\n\n181\n00:08:52.619 --> 00:08:54.272\nYou may not have a choice in other words,\nright?\n\n182\n00:08:54.272 --> 00:08:56.625\nBy law,\nyou may have to notify these parties.\n\n183\n00:08:56.625 --> 00:08:57.857\nBut, you may not.\n\n184\n00:08:57.857 --> 00:08:58.880\nIt really just depends.\n\n185\n00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.614\nSo, that's gonna be one of those\nthings you put an asterisk next to.\n\n186\n00:09:01.614 --> 00:09:03.625\nYou say, it would be good to do that.\n\n187\n00:09:03.625 --> 00:09:06.615\nBut, if there's an option,\nare they gonna add value?\n\n188\n00:09:06.615 --> 00:09:10.950\nCuz what you don't wanna have happen is\nnotify these agencies, have them come in\n\n189\n00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:15.285\nand dramatically complicate and extend\nthe incident response, and allow you,\n\n190\n00:09:15.285 --> 00:09:18.873\nunfortunately, not to get back to\nnormal as quickly as possible.\n\n191\n00:09:18.873 --> 00:09:22.070\nBecause they're doing the things\nthat they are designed to do, but\n\n192\n00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.437\nas a result are extending\nthat recovery process.\n\n193\n00:09:24.437 --> 00:09:25.307\nThat would not be a good outcome.\n\n194\n00:09:25.307 --> 00:09:26.342\n&gt;&gt; The red tape gun comes out.\n\n195\n00:09:26.342 --> 00:09:27.222\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, right.\n\n196\n00:09:27.222 --> 00:09:28.180\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n197\n00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.610\n&gt;&gt; Let me have five copies of that,\n\n198\n00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:33.050\nand could you take three days to\ngenerate them for me please, right?\n\n199\n00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:37.650\nSo, then eradication, system recovery, or\nsystems recovery if there's more than one.\n\n200\n00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:40.144\nIncident documentation.\n\n201\n00:09:40.144 --> 00:09:42.000\nIncident damage and cost assessment.\n\n202\n00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.430\nAnd of course, finally, as we've always\nsaid, review and update response policies.\n\n203\n00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:48.500\nGo back and figure out,\nare lessons learned?\n\n204\n00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:53.425\nAnd a reintegration and reiteration of\nthose lessons into future responses.\n\n205\n00:09:53.425 --> 00:09:55.768\nSo, this is the general thought process,\n\n206\n00:09:55.768 --> 00:09:58.965\nthe high level step-by-step\nmethodology we engage in.\n\n207\n00:09:58.965 --> 00:10:02.407\nWhat we wanna do is drill down a little\nbit, talk in more depth about these steps,\n\n208\n00:10:02.407 --> 00:10:03.673\nbreak them down a little bit,\n\n209\n00:10:03.673 --> 00:10:06.888\nunderstand more about them over the next\nfew minutes of our conversation.\n\n210\n00:10:06.888 --> 00:10:10.189\nWe're gonna do that, or at least take\nan opportunity to do that now with you.\n\n211\n00:10:10.189 --> 00:10:13.156\nLet's go through, we'll leave this up, and\nwe'll just kind of talk to it as we go.\n\n212\n00:10:13.156 --> 00:10:15.962\nThat way we can be reminded of\nit as we kinda go through and\n\n213\n00:10:15.962 --> 00:10:18.015\ndiscuss the various intricacies here.\n\n214\n00:10:18.015 --> 00:10:19.806\nSo, with regards to\ninstant identification,\n\n215\n00:10:19.806 --> 00:10:21.069\nwhat are we thinking about here?\n\n216\n00:10:21.069 --> 00:10:24.462\nAs I indicated, do we actually have\nan incident in the first place, right?\n\n217\n00:10:24.462 --> 00:10:26.704\nSo, validating that\nan incident has occurred.\n\n218\n00:10:26.704 --> 00:10:28.152\nVery important to think about that.\n\n219\n00:10:28.152 --> 00:10:31.417\nWe don't wanna go chasing those\npurple squirrels if we can avoid it.\n\n220\n00:10:31.417 --> 00:10:35.222\nSo, if we don't have a tried and true\ndefined incident based on our criteria\n\n221\n00:10:35.222 --> 00:10:38.374\nwe wanna know that up front, so\nwe don't get down to step 10 or\n\n222\n00:10:38.374 --> 00:10:41.823\n12 before we figure out the hard\nway that whatever we're doing is,\n\n223\n00:10:41.823 --> 00:10:45.885\nunfortunately, not realistically gonna\nyield the results we were hoping for.\n\n224\n00:10:45.885 --> 00:10:48.536\nSo, first and foremost,\nvalidate we have an incident.\n\n225\n00:10:48.536 --> 00:10:50.360\nIdentify the nature of that incident.\n\n226\n00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:54.654\nSo, know what it is so we can then, as we\nbegin the response thought process and\n\n227\n00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:58.383\nprocedures, route that incident\ninto the appropriate channels.\n\n228\n00:10:58.383 --> 00:10:59.901\nIdentify and protect evidence.\n\n229\n00:10:59.901 --> 00:11:01.060\nThat's gonna be important.\n\n230\n00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:04.625\nAnd also, log and make a report of\nwhatever anomalies are observed,\n\n231\n00:11:04.625 --> 00:11:08.250\nso that way we understand what it\nis we're beginning to address.\n\n232\n00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:11.856\nIf we show up and find that the computer\nthat is normally supposed to be\n\n233\n00:11:11.856 --> 00:11:15.522\nproviding email support for\nus is in three pieces laying on the floor,\n\n234\n00:11:15.522 --> 00:11:19.582\nthat's a little bit different than\nshowing up and everything looks normal.\n\n235\n00:11:19.582 --> 00:11:23.502\nBut, then through further investigation we\nfind out that there's been some sort of\n\n236\n00:11:23.502 --> 00:11:25.156\nunauthorized log on to the system,\n\n237\n00:11:25.156 --> 00:11:28.983\nbut we were not aware of that until we\ndid some additional investigation, right?\n\n238\n00:11:28.983 --> 00:11:31.673\nSo, it depends on what you see\nwhen you walk in, essentially.\n\n239\n00:11:31.673 --> 00:11:34.520\nAnd we have to understand that not\neverything is what it appears to be on\n\n240\n00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:35.610\nthe surface, right?\n\n241\n00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:39.390\nEverything can look normal but we can find\nout very quickly things are not normal.\n\n242\n00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:41.466\nEverything could look\ntotally disrupted but\n\n243\n00:11:41.466 --> 00:11:45.134\nwe could find out that that's expected\nbased on the behavior that's going on.\n\n244\n00:11:45.134 --> 00:11:48.191\nSomebody's in the middle of swapping\nout a server in the rack and\n\n245\n00:11:48.191 --> 00:11:49.840\nthey've taken that server down.\n\n246\n00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.554\nIt's laying sideways on the floor and\nthey're about to put a new one up.\n\n247\n00:11:53.554 --> 00:11:57.011\nThat would be something that may look\nunusual to us when we walk in without\n\n248\n00:11:57.011 --> 00:11:59.458\nthe prior context and\nknowledge of that activity.\n\n249\n00:11:59.458 --> 00:12:03.261\nBut, when we understand the context of the\nmaintenance window that's being exercised,\n\n250\n00:12:03.261 --> 00:12:05.472\nit looks perfectly normal and\nlegitimate, right?\n\n251\n00:12:05.472 --> 00:12:07.272\nSo, we have to think about that and\n\n252\n00:12:07.272 --> 00:12:10.740\nunderstand that with regards\nto incident identification.\n\n253\n00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:14.887\nWhat kind of actions may you take with\nregards to incident identification?\n\n254\n00:12:14.887 --> 00:12:16.994\nThings like audit log collection.\n\n255\n00:12:16.994 --> 00:12:19.237\nWanna look at logs and audit them.\n\n256\n00:12:19.237 --> 00:12:22.151\nBut general, collect all the logs,\nsecurity logs,\n\n257\n00:12:22.151 --> 00:12:25.922\napplication logs, network service logs,\nweb service logs, etc.\n\n258\n00:12:25.922 --> 00:12:27.390\nLook at various logs.\n\n259\n00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:30.112\nLook at incident reporting and\nassessment tools you may have.\n\n260\n00:12:30.112 --> 00:12:32.780\nHas there been a ticket\nopened on the help desk?\n\n261\n00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:34.665\nIf so, what's that ticket say?\n\n262\n00:12:34.665 --> 00:12:37.974\nIs there an issue in the IDS or\nIPS that's bubbled up?\n\n263\n00:12:37.974 --> 00:12:41.204\nThe Intrusion Detection or\nIntrusion Prevention System.\n\n264\n00:12:41.204 --> 00:12:45.225\nThat maybe something that's on the radar\nscreen that we have to be aware of.\n\n265\n00:12:45.225 --> 00:12:47.373\nHas somebody reported an incident, but\n\n266\n00:12:47.373 --> 00:12:50.354\nmay have just sent an email\nto an individual responder?\n\n267\n00:12:50.354 --> 00:12:52.280\nAll these things have to be thought about.\n\n268\n00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:57.140\nCollect and protect information in\nthe systems and systems themselves.\n\n269\n00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:00.311\nAre we using a Syslog or\na SIEM system of some kind?\n\n270\n00:13:00.311 --> 00:13:03.808\nS-I-E-M, Security Information\nEvent Management system.\n\n271\n00:13:03.808 --> 00:13:04.741\nSo, are we using that?\n\n272\n00:13:04.741 --> 00:13:08.811\nIf so, do we have central\naggregation of logs and information?\n\n273\n00:13:08.811 --> 00:13:12.179\nAnd can we go to that central system and\npull down the records?\n\n274\n00:13:12.179 --> 00:13:13.450\nAre they authoritative?\n\n275\n00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:14.480\nAre they legitimate?\n\n276\n00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.990\nHave they been compromised?\n\n277\n00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:16.844\nHow do we know?\n\n278\n00:13:16.844 --> 00:13:18.136\nAre they time synchronized?\n\n279\n00:13:18.136 --> 00:13:20.730\nAnd, is that time synchronization\nworking properly?\n\n280\n00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:22.603\nWe've talked about the value\nof some of this before.\n\n281\n00:13:22.603 --> 00:13:25.120\nSo, we have to think about those\nthings and understand them.\n\n282\n00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.579\nWhat about incident recording, right?\n\n283\n00:13:27.579 --> 00:13:28.610\nMoving down to step 2.\n\n284\n00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:30.375\nWhat are some things to think about there?\n\n285\n00:13:30.375 --> 00:13:32.732\nCapturing details, like the date and\ntime of the incident.\n\n286\n00:13:32.732 --> 00:13:34.090\nWhen did it occur?\n\n287\n00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:35.550\nUnder what circumstances?\n\n288\n00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:36.113\nAt what time?\n\n289\n00:13:36.113 --> 00:13:37.290\nAt what location?\n\n290\n00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:39.012\nWho was involved, right?\n\n291\n00:13:39.012 --> 00:13:42.060\nSo, the who, what, when, where, why,\nand how, essentially, questions.\n\n292\n00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.690\nFive Ws and the H,\nwould be things we wanna think about.\n\n293\n00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:46.600\nSo, date and time of incident occurrence.\n\n294\n00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.350\nDate and time of incident detection.\n\n295\n00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:54.206\nIncidents may occur seconds,\nmoments, days, weeks, months,\n\n296\n00:13:54.206 --> 00:13:56.644\nyears before they are detected.\n\n297\n00:13:56.644 --> 00:13:59.662\nThere have been ample evidence,\nor there is ample evidence,\n\n298\n00:13:59.662 --> 00:14:02.910\nmany stories of the fact that some\nof these very large scale hacking\n\n299\n00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:04.724\nstories that we hear about, right?\n\n300\n00:14:04.724 --> 00:14:07.320\nThe Home Depots,\n\n301\n00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:12.527\nthe Heartland breach, the-\n&gt;&gt; Target.\n\n302\n00:14:12.527 --> 00:14:15.431\n&gt;&gt; Target breach, the JP Morgan Chase,\n\n303\n00:14:15.431 --> 00:14:19.249\nwhich was attacked at\nthe beginning of 2016.\n\n304\n00:14:19.249 --> 00:14:20.075\n&gt;&gt; Sony.\n\n305\n00:14:20.075 --> 00:14:21.782\n&gt;&gt; Sony Pictures, certainly.\n\n306\n00:14:21.782 --> 00:14:22.687\nA couple of different SONYs.\n\n307\n00:14:22.687 --> 00:14:23.452\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's true.\n\n308\n00:14:23.452 --> 00:14:24.868\n&gt;&gt; They've unfortunately\nmade the list a few times.\n\n309\n00:14:24.868 --> 00:14:26.646\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's not enough just to say Sony,\n\n310\n00:14:26.646 --> 00:14:29.071\ncuz there's about four or\nfive associated with them at this point.\n\n311\n00:14:29.071 --> 00:14:33.070\nHow'd you like to be the incident manager\nthat gets to sit in that set of meetings\n\n312\n00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:34.573\nover a year and a half at Sony?\n\n313\n00:14:34.573 --> 00:14:35.309\n&gt;&gt; I quit, I quit.\nI'm gonna go be a truck driver.\n\n314\n00:14:35.309 --> 00:14:37.067\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; At that point, you can't even show up.\n\n315\n00:14:37.067 --> 00:14:39.738\nYou're so embarrassed,\nyou can't even walk in the room.\n\n316\n00:14:39.738 --> 00:14:40.802\nLike, you again?\n\n317\n00:14:40.802 --> 00:14:41.500\nRight?\nWhat\n\n318\n00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:42.935\nare we here to talk about this time,\nright?\n\n319\n00:14:42.935 --> 00:14:44.876\nSo, there's a list that goes on and on.\n\n320\n00:14:44.876 --> 00:14:45.789\nAny of these, right?\n\n321\n00:14:45.789 --> 00:14:49.552\nMany of these really big ones, when we\ngo back and look at the timeline and\n\n322\n00:14:49.552 --> 00:14:51.972\nstart to unravel it\nthrough investigations.\n\n323\n00:14:51.972 --> 00:14:54.845\nWe walk through all these steps, and\nget down towards the middle and,\n\n324\n00:14:54.845 --> 00:14:56.269\nultimately, down to the bottom.\n\n325\n00:14:56.269 --> 00:15:00.837\nDocumentation, damage and cost assessment,\nreview and update response policies.\n\n326\n00:15:00.837 --> 00:15:04.753\nAs we fully understand and\nunravel and document that story,\n\n327\n00:15:04.753 --> 00:15:08.823\nwe often find that the delta\nbetween incident occurrence, and\n\n328\n00:15:08.823 --> 00:15:13.613\nincident detection, in some cases was\nmonths, or even a year or longer.\n\n329\n00:15:13.613 --> 00:15:17.940\nBecause the people that were executing\nthese attacks were good enough that they\n\n330\n00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.147\nwent unrecognized for such a long time.\n\n331\n00:15:20.147 --> 00:15:21.329\nIt was the case at Target.\n\n332\n00:15:21.329 --> 00:15:22.598\nIt was the case at Home Depot.\n\n333\n00:15:22.598 --> 00:15:25.100\nIt was the case with Sony\nover numerous events.\n\n334\n00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.667\nIt was the case with Heartland.\n\n335\n00:15:27.667 --> 00:15:32.305\nSome of the biggest breaches in\ninformation security history to date have\n\n336\n00:15:32.305 --> 00:15:36.659\ngone unreported or unrecognized for\na very extended period of time.\n\n337\n00:15:36.659 --> 00:15:38.820\nSo, it's important to capture\nthe delta between those two.\n\n338\n00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.168\nVery important to know about that.\n\n339\n00:15:40.168 --> 00:15:41.360\nWho reported the incident?\n\n340\n00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.900\nWanna know who actually\nmade the identification.\n\n341\n00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.735\nWe can go back and interact with them.\n\n342\n00:15:45.735 --> 00:15:49.799\nDetails of the incident\nitself that we are reporting.\n\n343\n00:15:49.799 --> 00:15:51.222\nThings like the description.\n\n344\n00:15:51.222 --> 00:15:55.294\nSo, we have to have a general description\non what was going on, the systems that may\n\n345\n00:15:55.294 --> 00:15:58.627\nbe affected or involved,\nat least at this stage, as far as we know.\n\n346\n00:15:58.627 --> 00:16:01.194\nAny information that may\nhave come up on the screens.\n\n347\n00:16:01.194 --> 00:16:05.342\nError messages, log files,\nall that kind of stuff should be captured,\n\n348\n00:16:05.342 --> 00:16:09.160\ngathered, created as part of\nthe initial incident report.\n\n349\n00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.330\nWhat about incident response?\n\n350\n00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.864\nLet's move down to step number three here.\n\n351\n00:16:12.864 --> 00:16:14.286\nIncident response.\n\n352\n00:16:14.286 --> 00:16:15.441\nWhat do we think about there?\n\n353\n00:16:15.441 --> 00:16:18.470\nA little bit more depth\nto our conversation.\n\n354\n00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:21.460\nThe initial investigation has to\nbe included here so we have to be\n\n355\n00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:24.870\nthinking about what we're gonna do now\nthat we've identified we have an incident.\n\n356\n00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:27.040\nWe figured out some of\nthe pertinent details,\n\n357\n00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.480\nwe've been given our marching orders,\nso to speak, right?\n\n358\n00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.230\nNow we have to go and start investigating.\n\n359\n00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:33.370\nSo we're gonna sit down and\ndeal with that.\n\n360\n00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:36.090\nWe're gonna obviously start\nto sort out the details,\n\n361\n00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:40.320\nfigure out how to separate the fact from\nfiction, what is important, what may or\n\n362\n00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.950\nmay not be fact versus fiction.\n\n363\n00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:44.830\nBuild the incident response team.\n\n364\n00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:46.760\nSo we're gonna throw those\npictures on the table,\n\n365\n00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:49.300\nstart figuring out the people\nwe need to call in and\n\n366\n00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.870\nstart figuring out the help we're\ngonna need to actually address this.\n\n367\n00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:55.690\nWe're gonna determine the type of incident\nthat's occurred, so we're gonna be able to\n\n368\n00:16:55.690 --> 00:17:00.030\nstart classifying ultimately further\ndown the list there around number seven.\n\n369\n00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:02.615\nWe're gonna be able to assess\nthe impact of the incident.\n\n370\n00:17:02.615 --> 00:17:04.885\nSo we're gonna have to figure that out and\nunderstand that.\n\n371\n00:17:04.885 --> 00:17:08.310\nThat will lead us eventually down\nthe road to item number 16 to be\n\n372\n00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:11.800\nable to do a damage and\ncost assessment later on in the process.\n\n373\n00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:16.590\nReport individuals or reporting to\nthe individuals about the occurrence\n\n374\n00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:21.210\nof the incident that may be on the front\nlines and make sure that they understand\n\n375\n00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:24.600\nthat there's been a breach or there's\nbeen an incident, they're systems maybe\n\n376\n00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:28.650\neffected and standby there's gonna\nbe more evidence, more information.\n\n377\n00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:32.680\nBut for instance, in many organizations\nwe have a line of business owners right.\n\n378\n00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:36.520\nPeople that essentially are line\nmanagers that own databases,\n\n379\n00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.960\nthat own directory services, that own\nmessaging, that are on web services.\n\n380\n00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:44.478\nThere may not be just an all out IT\nfunction that takes care of everything.\n\n381\n00:17:44.478 --> 00:17:47.060\nThere are sub divisions and\nspecialties within it\n\n382\n00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:50.240\nthat typically have people that\nare on the hook to manage this.\n\n383\n00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.970\nWe have to get in touch with that manager,\n\n384\n00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:56.260\nthat owner of that system, make them aware\nof the fact that there's been a breach.\n\n385\n00:17:56.260 --> 00:18:00.680\nIf we don't do that, then we're gonna have\na problem responding because we're not\n\n386\n00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.880\ngonna get the proper authority and\nthe proper support, proper buy-in from\n\n387\n00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:08.320\nthat manager to free up resources and get\nsystem access when we have to go in and\n\n388\n00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:12.230\ndo the and the ultimate response\nthat we need to engage in.\n\n389\n00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:13.900\nSo this is gonna become important.\n\n390\n00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:17.990\nAnd this brings up a very important fact,\na very critical fact for\n\n391\n00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:22.430\nus as incident responders, which is we\nneed to have accurate documentation.\n\n392\n00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:26.180\nAnd information about the organizational\nstructure, the org chart,\n\n393\n00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:30.720\nor the tree if you will of organization,\nright, in the business.\n\n394\n00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.340\nWho is that line of business owner?\n\n395\n00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:35.680\nDoes Daniel own databases,\nor does he own messaging?\n\n396\n00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.700\nAnd if he owns one and\n\n397\n00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.200\nI'm addressing the other,\nI'm not talking to the right person.\n\n398\n00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.830\nI've got to figure out who that is.\n\n399\n00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:45.620\nSo, it's important for us as incident\nresponders to have access to\n\n400\n00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:49.630\nan understanding of this information\nto be able to verify and validate it so\n\n401\n00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:53.780\nthat we can be focused and out of\nthe gate as quickly as possible with our\n\n402\n00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:57.930\ncommunications because nothing worse,\ntrust me, nothing worse then sounding\n\n403\n00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:02.230\nthe alarm bell and tell the wrong person\nthere's been a breach in their systems and\n\n404\n00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:05.996\ngetting them all riled up only to find\nout it's not them you're talking to and\n\n405\n00:19:05.996 --> 00:19:07.900\nit's not their systems your addressing.\n\n406\n00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.420\nSomebody totally different and\nbecause the org chart,\n\n407\n00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:13.520\njust your knowledge of that layout and\n\n408\n00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:17.750\nthat org chart is not accurate, you've\nessentially become Chicken Little, right?\n\n409\n00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:20.740\nYou're crying that the sky is falling,\nand that's not happening.\n\n410\n00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:21.983\nOr Peter and the Wolf, right, [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; It's like\n\n411\n00:19:21.983 --> 00:19:25.458\nannouncing the winners at the Oscars,\nthat's people all worked up, and [LAUGH]\n\n412\n00:19:25.458 --> 00:19:29.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I didn't watch that firsthand.\n\n413\n00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.640\nWe talked about the issues\nwith reality TV.\n\n414\n00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:36.160\nI classify that into the reality TV\nconcept for me I figure, and look,\n\n415\n00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.220\nit's just me, but\nthere's some news you wanna see live.\n\n416\n00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.530\nThere's some things that are truly,\nlegitimately important.\n\n417\n00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:44.410\nI'm not in anyway saying that the Oscars\naren't an important event for\n\n418\n00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:45.640\npeople that want to see them or\nwatch them.\n\n419\n00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.220\nI think they're exciting, you should, but\n\n420\n00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.320\nthere's also stuff that you can\njust read about after the fact.\n\n421\n00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:52.240\nAnd it's just as compelling\nwhen you find out who won\n\n422\n00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.920\nif you read about it the next day, right?\n\n423\n00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.870\nAt least, that's just my take on it\nanyway, I'm just not a big TV person.\n\n424\n00:19:56.870 --> 00:20:00.083\nSo I didn't watch it live, but then\nagain I made the wrong choice because,\n\n425\n00:20:00.083 --> 00:20:02.491\nclearly the comedy of errors\nthat occurred [CROSSTALK].\n\n426\n00:20:02.491 --> 00:20:05.010\nEspecially with Warren Beatty\nof all people, right?\n\n427\n00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:07.790\nIt was probably classic to watch\nhim try to work through that, so.\n\n428\n00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:13.310\nAnyway, point being, we want to make sure\nwe're spot on with our communication.\n\n429\n00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:15.790\nAnd although we don't say it here,\nand we don't often talk about it,\n\n430\n00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:19.230\nit's one of those kind of\nunspoken untalked about,\n\n431\n00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:22.850\nbut critical pieces of information\nthat make you successful.\n\n432\n00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:25.140\nIt's one of those you learn the hard way,\nlessons, right.\n\n433\n00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.510\nYou learn it, and\nthen you never have it happen again, but\n\n434\n00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:30.840\nif you don't know it, it can plague\nyou until you figure it out, right.\n\n435\n00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.250\nSo I'm trying to give you\nthe benefit of some insights and\n\n436\n00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:34.560\nreal world experience here.\n\n437\n00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.700\nMake sure you're up to date right?\n\n438\n00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:38.880\nOn what those people are, who they are,\n\n439\n00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.720\nto the best of your ability because\nif you're not I promise you\n\n440\n00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.760\nyou're gonna pick up the phone or send an\nemail to the wrong people at some point.\n\n441\n00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.630\nAnd you don't wanna be on\nthe receiving end of that conversation\n\n442\n00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:49.110\nit just never ends well right.\n\n443\n00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:53.240\nSo please be aware that, also understand\nwith regards to initial response right?\n\n444\n00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:56.430\nThis forms the basis,\nthis is the critic pivot point.\n\n445\n00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:58.810\nStep three, right here,\nfor everything we do,\n\n446\n00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:01.180\nultimately, for\ncomprehensive incident response.\n\n447\n00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:02.290\nIf we get it right here,\n\n448\n00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:06.440\nif we nail the details initially in\ninitial response, everything we do.\n\n449\n00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:10.320\nAnd you can see there's 13 other steps\nwe gotta engage in after this, right?\n\n450\n00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:13.290\nIf we get this right,\neverything else flows and\n\n451\n00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:15.000\nwe get comprehensive incident response.\n\n452\n00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.690\nWe get this wrong, we're gonna waste time,\nenergy and resources.\n\n453\n00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:22.500\nWe may miss something and ultimately\ndrop a ball, but we are unfortunately,\n\n454\n00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:25.700\nnot going to be as authoritative and\nas focused as we need to be.\n\n455\n00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:27.519\nSo, it's gonna really be a big issue.\n\n456\n00:21:27.519 --> 00:21:30.090\nCommunication, very critical,\nas I've been suggesting.\n\n457\n00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:34.755\nGotta make sure we minimize the impact of\nthe incident by maximizing communication.\n\n458\n00:21:34.755 --> 00:21:37.840\nBut communication that leads\nto better coordination and\n\n459\n00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.130\nthe sharing of information\namong the interested parties.\n\n460\n00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:42.250\nVery important for\nus to think of that, right?\n\n461\n00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:45.350\nSo that takes us down,\nwe did communication,\n\n462\n00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:46.680\nwe kind of talked about that, step four.\n\n463\n00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.290\nStep five, containment,\nas I hit the wrong button here.\n\n464\n00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:51.880\nGive me just a second here to scroll\nback up to where I need to be as I'm\n\n465\n00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.180\ntracking across both my machines here.\n\n466\n00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:54.960\nSo containment.\n\n467\n00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:55.850\nWhat is containment all about?\n\n468\n00:21:55.850 --> 00:22:00.670\nWhen we think about containment, I think\nabout the idea of mitigation, right,\n\n469\n00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:02.470\nthe ability to be able to minimize.\n\n470\n00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:05.230\nAnd people often think, okay,\ncontainment means I'm gonna eradicate.\n\n471\n00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:07.060\nNo, eradication happens lower down.\n\n472\n00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.150\nthat's item number 13, right?\n\n473\n00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:11.860\nEradication is hey,\nlet's get rid of the infection.\n\n474\n00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:14.740\nLet's get rid of whatever the issue and\nconcern is and\n\n475\n00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:18.670\nas a result of that let's them\nreturn to normal in step 14.\n\n476\n00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:21.010\nContainments about putting up a barrier,\n\n477\n00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:25.070\na protection perimeter,\nthat allows up to prevent further spread.\n\n478\n00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:29.450\nNot about getting rid of everything that's\nalready occurred and returning normal.\n\n479\n00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:32.780\nWhat I don't, in other words, wanna have\nyou understand about containment, what I\n\n480\n00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:36.340\ndon't want you to think it is, is hitting\nthe reset button and everything's good.\n\n481\n00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:40.110\nContainment's about let's stop and\ngo no further and then let's work\n\n482\n00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:44.770\ninward from the protection perimeter to\nstart dissecting and ultimately removing\n\n483\n00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:48.740\nthe things that are gonna be problematic\nover the next several stages until we get\n\n484\n00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:52.720\nto the point where we're comfortable to\neradicate and then ultimately to recover.\n\n485\n00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:56.020\nBut notice that happens at almost\nthe very end of this cycle.\n\n486\n00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:56.570\nStep 13 and\n\n487\n00:22:56.570 --> 00:23:00.710\n14 is where we get rid of what's going\non and we try to return to normal.\n\n488\n00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:02.450\nWe're only up at step five right now.\n\n489\n00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:03.370\nright?\nI mean, there's a lot\n\n490\n00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:05.860\nof stuff we got to do\nbefore we get to hey,\n\n491\n00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:09.400\nlet's un-infect that system by\nrunning a malware removal tool.\n\n492\n00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.870\nLet's restart and\nmake sure that there's no root kit.\n\n493\n00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:15.560\nLet's then go ahead and recover\nthat system, put it back to normal.\n\n494\n00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:19.800\nMaybe we reimage, or we reapply a base\nline through a remediation tool.\n\n495\n00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.210\nWhatever we're gonna do.\n\n496\n00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:23.750\nAnd then we'll document what we did and\n\n497\n00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:26.140\nhopefully if all goes well\nwe'll declare victory, right.\n\n498\n00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.890\nBut that's gonna happen almost at the very\nend, so you gotta make sure that you\n\n499\n00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:31.990\nunderstand containment is not about\nputting everything back to normal.\n\n500\n00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:36.310\nContainment is about stopping the spread,\nallowing it to go no further.\n\n501\n00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:38.760\nYou shall not pass, right,\nas what we say, right?\n\n502\n00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.830\nSo, no further with containment.\n\n503\n00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:42.120\n&gt;&gt; I was thinking of Star Trek.\n\n504\n00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.010\nThey get into a battle in space,\n\n505\n00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:48.980\nand there's been a hole breach on\nsection three start a containment field.\n\n506\n00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:49.790\n&gt;&gt; Containment field?\n\n507\n00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:50.520\n&gt;&gt; Like a force field!\n\n508\n00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:51.570\n&gt;&gt; They start a containment, right.\n\n509\n00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:53.410\nStop the bleeding.\n\n510\n00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:54.260\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n511\n00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.860\nApply the space tourniquet\nto the spaceship and\n\n512\n00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:58.910\nthen from that point forward, continue on.\n\n513\n00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:00.686\nSo it's exactly what,\nwe're mixing our metaphors here right?\n\n514\n00:24:00.686 --> 00:24:01.414\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n515\n00:24:01.414 --> 00:24:01.950\n&gt;&gt; All right, so.\n\n516\n00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:04.156\nWell you get the idea,\nyou know what we're talking about.\n\n517\n00:24:04.156 --> 00:24:06.651\nAll right, so\nnow Formulating a response strategy.\n\n518\n00:24:06.651 --> 00:24:07.642\nItem number six.\n\n519\n00:24:07.642 --> 00:24:08.977\nSo what are we doing here?\n\n520\n00:24:08.977 --> 00:24:13.821\nWe're focusing in on, and remember,\nwe just put up the force field.\n\n521\n00:24:13.821 --> 00:24:15.572\nThe containment vessel.\n\n522\n00:24:15.572 --> 00:24:18.201\nSo we're putting out\nthe protection perimeter and\n\n523\n00:24:18.201 --> 00:24:19.859\nsaying you shall go no further.\n\n524\n00:24:19.859 --> 00:24:20.740\nNow, what are we gonna do?\n\n525\n00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:23.200\nWe've essentially stabilized.\n\n526\n00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.510\nIf we've done this correctly,\n\n527\n00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:29.100\nstabilize the spread of the incident\nprevent it from getting any further.\n\n528\n00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:34.630\nNow, we have to step back and we've to\nsay, what is the thing we're dealing with?\n\n529\n00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:35.460\nWhat is the incident?\n\n530\n00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:36.850\nWhat are we gonna do?\n\n531\n00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:42.840\nWhat do we have to understand and know and\ndecide on so we can respond effectively?\n\n532\n00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:47.340\nSo formulating a response strategy is\nabout taking inventory, essentially.\n\n533\n00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:49.310\nTaking stock of the situation.\n\n534\n00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:53.580\nBeginning to understand what it is we're\nfacing and through the next several\n\n535\n00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:58.020\nsteps as you can see, classification,\ninvestigation, data collection,\n\n536\n00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:03.240\nforensically sound collection,\nprotection and management of evidence.\n\n537\n00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:07.140\nBeing prepared, being position to be\nable to them move in to eradicate and\n\n538\n00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:08.660\nultimately restore service.\n\n539\n00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:13.470\nSo when we formulate a response strategy\nwe're dealing with trying to figure out\n\n540\n00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:15.690\nwho would be the most\nappropriate resources?\n\n541\n00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:17.380\nWhat kinda tools do we need?\n\n542\n00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.060\nAre we communicating\nwith the right people?\n\n543\n00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:20.560\nWe have the right support?\n\n544\n00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:21.340\nIf so, great!\n\n545\n00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:25.430\nLet's put together a plan If not, let's\nstep back and figure out the who, what,\n\n546\n00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:30.050\nwhen, where why and how so\nwe understand that what we're about to do\n\n547\n00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:34.520\nis gonna be targeted towards the most\nlikely opportunities to be successful.\n\n548\n00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:37.490\nAnd that's what we have to consider and\nmake sure we're aware of.\n\n549\n00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:41.960\nIncident classification is gonna be how we\nultimately allow the security management\n\n550\n00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.710\nfunction or the incident response and\nmanagement coordination functions.\n\n551\n00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:48.610\nTo understand what the incident is and\n\n552\n00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:51.620\ncreate that classification\nscheme ahead of time.\n\n553\n00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:55.450\nHigh, medium, low impact,\nit's a system breach, it's a hull breach,\n\n554\n00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:56.750\nas Daniel said.\n\n555\n00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:59.348\nProbably have a classification for\nthat if you're on a starship but\n\n556\n00:25:59.348 --> 00:26:00.541\nmost people probably don't.\n\n557\n00:26:00.541 --> 00:26:03.560\nBut is it an email issue?\n\n558\n00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.035\nIs it a malware issue?\n\n559\n00:26:05.035 --> 00:26:06.725\nIs it a hacking issue?\n\n560\n00:26:06.725 --> 00:26:08.065\nIs it a credential issue?\n\n561\n00:26:08.065 --> 00:26:11.445\nThese are things that we would have\nto come up with classifications for\n\n562\n00:26:11.445 --> 00:26:13.605\nbecause we have to deal with\nthese things differently.\n\n563\n00:26:13.605 --> 00:26:15.255\nIs it a high, medium, or low impact?\n\n564\n00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:19.120\nVersus, is it an access control issue or\n\n565\n00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.940\nis it the fact that somebody\nplaced malware on a system?\n\n566\n00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:25.890\nHowever, we classify we've got to\nfigure out what it is we're addressing.\n\n567\n00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:27.254\nIf all we do is say, my God,\n\n568\n00:26:27.254 --> 00:26:30.388\nwe've got a security issue,\nI don't really know what that means.\n\n569\n00:26:30.388 --> 00:26:32.900\nI mean that could mean so\nmany different things.\n\n570\n00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:35.630\nIt could mean any or\nall the things I described and more.\n\n571\n00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:38.450\nSo what we have to understand\nultimately is that we have to\n\n572\n00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:43.120\ncome up with a way to describe and\nclarify what we're dealing with.\n\n573\n00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:47.500\nAnd put things into buckets or\nlittle areas, little shelves and boxes,\n\n574\n00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:51.800\nso that people can clearly articulate and\nunderstand how to tell that story so\n\n575\n00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.400\nthat we can then respond accordingly.\n\n576\n00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.110\nSo this becomes very important.\n\n577\n00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:59.080\nSo the steps to be implemented during\nclassification are categorization,\n\n578\n00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:02.170\nprioritization, and resource allocation.\n\n579\n00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:07.150\nCategorization, prioritization, and\nresource allocation as I just described.\n\n580\n00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:09.950\nThis all takes place under\nincident classification.\n\n581\n00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:12.096\nWhat about investigation overall?\n\n582\n00:27:12.096 --> 00:27:14.170\nSo moving down and\nthinking about step eight.\n\n583\n00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:15.880\nWe're roughly half way through now.\n\n584\n00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:20.950\nIn the investigation phase, this is where\nwe actually are going to try to identify\n\n585\n00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:25.790\nwho the perpetrators are and or who are\nthe threat sources, the bad actors, right,\n\n586\n00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:30.500\nthat have taken advantage of or somehow\nexploited a vulnerability or weakness.\n\n587\n00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:33.240\nSo we have uncovered, or\nthey have uncovered in the system.\n\n588\n00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.090\nSo this is where we\nstart to actually go in.\n\n589\n00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:41.060\nWe start to lay hands on the machines or\nexamine the operational theater,\n\n590\n00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:44.290\nthe environment that may have\nbeen affected by this incident.\n\n591\n00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:48.810\nBut we are now, roughly, half way through\nthis thought process and we have yet\n\n592\n00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:50.800\nto actually start touching the systems.\n\n593\n00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:54.910\nIt's just now, halfway through,\nthat we begin to feel confident and\n\n594\n00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:57.150\ncomfortable in all\nthe planning we've done.\n\n595\n00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:02.110\nAll the thought process,\nall the layout of all of the mechanics and\n\n596\n00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:06.350\nthe tools necessary to be successful,\nall that's taken place.\n\n597\n00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:08.100\nNow, we're ready to go in and\n\n598\n00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:12.660\nactually start to be able to examine\nthe affected system of systems and\n\n599\n00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:16.920\nto derive some understanding of, and\nbegin to make some thought processes or\n\n600\n00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:20.310\nconclusions around what we're\ngonna do to restore it over time.\n\n601\n00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:21.510\nBut this is halfway through.\n\n602\n00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:25.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's interesting, it was\na lot of ground work that needs to be done\n\n603\n00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:29.630\nbefore, like Adam said, that we start\nactually laying hands on systems,\n\n604\n00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:31.850\nmachines, infections,\nwhatever the case is.\n\n605\n00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:36.710\nBut it's necessary, if you don't make\nthose categorizations on the threats.\n\n606\n00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:38.810\nWhat is what, who should I be talking to?\n\n607\n00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:42.570\nYou don't have that plan, you're just\ngonna be running around trying everything\n\n608\n00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:45.710\nand the kitchen sink, and\nhopefully something sticks methodical,\n\n609\n00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:49.910\nsystematic approaches to these\nprocesses is the better way to go.\n\n610\n00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:54.436\nIt reduces time, allows you to triage\na whole lot fast and then get to the more\n\n611\n00:28:54.436 --> 00:28:59.105\nfun stuff which is hey, let's jump on\nthis computer, let's find out who this\n\n612\n00:28:59.105 --> 00:29:03.892\nperson is and then eradicate them, or\ntheir bugs that they put on our computer.\n\n613\n00:29:03.892 --> 00:29:07.839\nBut that being said, we're gonna have\nto do that part in a second episode, or\n\n614\n00:29:07.839 --> 00:29:08.770\na third episode.\n\n615\n00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:10.350\nWe're on part three now.\n\n616\n00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:12.040\nBut all good stuff, a lot of fun.\n\n617\n00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:14.160\nAdam, thanks for joining us again today.\n\n618\n00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:18.685\nWe look forward to seeing you in our part\nthree on this incident response steps that\n\n619\n00:29:18.685 --> 00:29:19.613\nwe need to take.\n\n620\n00:29:19.613 --> 00:29:23.250\nWe look forward to seeing you as well,\nbut it is that time for us to sign of.\n\n621\n00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:26.420\nFor IT Pro TV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n622\n00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:27.363\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n623\n00:29:27.363 --> 00:29:28.525\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n624\n00:29:31.045 --> 00:29:36.699\n[MUSIC]\n\n625\n00:29:36.699 -->

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.476 --> 00:00:14.375\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:14.375 --> 00:00:16.849\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.834\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode we are going to\n\n7\n00:00:21.834 --> 00:00:26.334\nkeep continuing moving forward\non the journey that is the ECIH.\n\n8\n00:00:26.334 --> 00:00:30.263\nThat's right, and joining us back at\nthe studio again we're continuing our\n\n9\n00:00:30.263 --> 00:00:33.040\nconversation on our\nincident response steps.\n\n10\n00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.920\nThings that we need to do,\nthe program and the procedure that is.\n\n11\n00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.920\nAnd to lend us to that what we need to do,\nour good friend Mr Adam Gordon.\n\n12\n00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.170\nAdam, welcome back again, sir.\n\n13\n00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.839\nHow goes it again?\n\n14\n00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.420\nThe thumbs up.\n\n15\n00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.380\nHe's gonna mime the whole show.\n\n16\n00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.120\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.130\n&gt;&gt; I'm not gonna talk for\n\n18\n00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.320\nthe entire episode,\nI'm gonna use cue cards.\n\n19\n00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.941\nAre you ready?\n\n20\n00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:51.461\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n21\n00:00:51.461 --> 00:00:53.021\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nyou remember that scene in Say Anything?\n\n22\n00:00:53.021 --> 00:00:53.821\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Where he's got his\n\n23\n00:00:53.821 --> 00:00:54.380\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n24\n00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.405\n&gt;&gt; That's what we're gonna do.\n\n25\n00:00:55.405 --> 00:00:58.552\nIf you haven't seen that movie, another\ngreat movie for you to take a look at.\n\n26\n00:00:58.552 --> 00:01:01.480\nAll right, anyway,\nlet's continue [LAUGH] where we left off.\n\n27\n00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.420\nWe were talking about incident handling\nrespond steps as the intercept.\n\n28\n00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.890\nGot roughly about halfway through\nout list in the last episode.\n\n29\n00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.640\nGonna remind you as I sometimes do but\nespecially for this one.\n\n30\n00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.950\nIf you have not seen our last episode,\n\n31\n00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.920\nwe're about to pick up halfway\nthrough this list and conversation.\n\n32\n00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.740\nIt's not gonna make too much sense to you.\n\n33\n00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.540\nGo back and take a look at the prior one.\n\n34\n00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.470\nMake sure you're up to date on\nthe list we're talking about.\n\n35\n00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.000\nAnd then, we're gonna be able to\nobviously bring you up to speed and\n\n36\n00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.160\ncontinue from here.\n\n37\n00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.590\nBut you're gonna wanna view that\nbefore you [LAUGH] view this,\n\n38\n00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.790\notherwise it's gonna be out of sequence,\nit's not gonna make a lot of sense to you.\n\n39\n00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.520\nIf we could, one more time.\n\n40\n00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.150\nIf we could.\n\n41\n00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.160\nNo, no, that way, right.\n\n42\n00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.410\nIf we could,\n&gt;&gt; To the right.\n\n43\n00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:36.190\n&gt;&gt; To the right, there we go.\n\n44\n00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.930\nIf we could, all right.\n\n45\n00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.320\nSo, thank you very much.\n\n46\n00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.110\nWe're gonna pick up with our incident\nresponse and handling steps.\n\n47\n00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.650\nWe left off, if I'm not mistaken sir,\nkeep me honest.\n\n48\n00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.360\nData collection, we were talking, right?\n\n49\n00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.529\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; I believe about data collection.\n\n50\n00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:48.520\n&gt;&gt; That's correct.\n&gt;&gt; We had mentioned the fact that\n\n51\n00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.240\nthis is where we're gonna to start through\n\n52\n00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.402\nincident investigations\nwhere we actually left off.\n\n53\n00:01:52.402 --> 00:01:54.110\nWe're gonna pick up with data collection,\nbut\n\n54\n00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.260\nit's an investigation as we're making the\npoint at very end of our conversation is\n\n55\n00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.162\nwhere we begin to engage with\nthe machine or the system or\n\n56\n00:02:03.162 --> 00:02:07.140\nwhatever that has been affected by\nthe incident and we start to actually\n\n57\n00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.950\nput hands on as Daniel said on the systems\nand we being to understand what's there.\n\n58\n00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.480\nWe begin our investigatory process.\n\n59\n00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.550\nData collections and forensic analysis,\nsteps nine and ten, and I would jump or\n\n60\n00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.590\ncollect and kind of roll ups step eleven,\nevidence protection, as well under this.\n\n61\n00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.630\nOur subsets essentially are going\nto be processes of data collection,\n\n62\n00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.630\nexcuse me, of incident investigation.\n\n63\n00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.520\nIn other words, incident\ninvestigation itself is really made\n\n64\n00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.510\nup of the ideas of data collection,\nforensic analysis and\n\n65\n00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.580\nthe protection of evidence as things we do\nto in order to drive the investigation.\n\n66\n00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.280\nRemember our ultimate goal here\nanswering the who, what, when, where,\n\n67\n00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.740\nwhy and how questions to how\nthings could have occurred.\n\n68\n00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.790\nDocumenting authoritatively and\ndescribing and telling that story.\n\n69\n00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.640\nSo that we can then understand what\nwe need to do to remediate and\n\n70\n00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.160\nmitigate the concerns that we are finding.\n\n71\n00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.140\nThis is what we're doing\nin the investigation and\n\n72\n00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.200\nthe collection, analysis and\nevidence protection phases.\n\n73\n00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.170\nThe guards of data collection,\nwe're gathering facts.\n\n74\n00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.150\nTrying to understand what is and\n\n75\n00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.060\nis not accurate about\nthe current state of the system.\n\n76\n00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.580\nAnd let's be clear, we are weighing and\n\n77\n00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.670\nessentially understanding by developing\nan understanding of the as is, right?\n\n78\n00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.110\nThe current state of the system, or\nsystems if there's more than one,\n\n79\n00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.540\nthat have been affected here.\n\n80\n00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.450\nWhatever that is good, bad or ugly.\n\n81\n00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.680\nRight or wrong, right?\n\n82\n00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.940\nCompelling or not.\n\n83\n00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:28.910\nBoring or exciting.\n\n84\n00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.780\nI'll keep going until you tell me\nthat I've found a set of descriptors\n\n85\n00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.970\nthat are accurate,\nwhatever they may be, right?\n\n86\n00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.570\nThe idea here, is that we have to\naccurately, or as accurately as possible,\n\n87\n00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.500\ncapture the current state of the systems,\nso that we can understand the drift,\n\n88\n00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.110\nthe delta, the difference between\nwhat is currently going on and\n\n89\n00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.970\nwhat the baseline says should be going on.\n\n90\n00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.500\nAnd that's how we do our comparison.\n\n91\n00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.470\nAnd if we're successful, and\nwe do this properly, and\n\n92\n00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.930\nwe have the right kind of documentation\nassociated with the system,\n\n93\n00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.550\nwe should then be able to understand\nfairly quickly what the problems are and\n\n94\n00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.150\nwhat the incidents specifically\nrelates to through data collection.\n\n95\n00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.380\nBut the trick is of course we need to\nunderstand there are different areas that\n\n96\n00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.470\nwe may we gather our evidence from\nthere is host space evidence,\n\n97\n00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.870\nevidence that may occur on individual\nmachine that we have to understand.\n\n98\n00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.640\nThere is logs locally on a machine, there\nmaybe settings that have to be understood,\n\n99\n00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.210\nscreens that we have to\ncapture things of that nature,\n\n100\n00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.870\nthere maybe network based information and\nevidence that we have to capture.\n\n101\n00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.920\nNetwork traffic captures through IDS and\nIPS and firewall and\n\n102\n00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.610\nrouter logs would be\nexamined in this case.\n\n103\n00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.640\nThe ability to understand how to connect\nto a certain system or whether or\n\n104\n00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.380\nnot we're able to do that accurately\nwould be something to consider.\n\n105\n00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.890\nAnd then, there's category\ngenerically lumped into as other.\n\n106\n00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.710\nThere may be supporting systems that are\navailable that we have to interact with.\n\n107\n00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.190\nMay be peripherals that\nare attached to a certain machine.\n\n108\n00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.580\nThat would have to be investigated\nand/or examined for evidence.\n\n109\n00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.860\nWe may have a USB thumb drive, for\n\n110\n00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.120\ninstance they have one attached\nto the machine, right?\n\n111\n00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.720\nThat kind of stuff would\nbe in the other category.\n\n112\n00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.230\nSo, we wanna make sure we understand there\nare multiple areas of evidence that we\n\n113\n00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.700\nwould have to focus on, and make sure\nthat we are thinking about in order to be\n\n114\n00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.040\nfocused properly at the right level\nwith regards to capturing evidence\n\n115\n00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.120\nfrom all the different areas that\nwould lead us to be able to make\n\n116\n00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.560\nthe proper determination about the state\nof the incident and how wide ranging and\n\n117\n00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.740\nimpactful it may or may not be.\n\n118\n00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.170\nWith regards for forensic analysis,\nthis is where we're analyzing and\n\n119\n00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.690\nreviewing the data, but doing so\nin a forensically sound manner.\n\n120\n00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.430\nThe idea's that we're gonna\nfollow the rules of evidence and\n\n121\n00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.540\nmake sure that we engage in\nevidentiary procedures that insure\n\n122\n00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.430\nchain of custody is\nmaintained at all times.\n\n123\n00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.230\nWe have an accurate log and representation\nof where the evidence has been.\n\n124\n00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:47.580\nUnder whose protection.\n\n125\n00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.600\nHow it's been addressed?\n\n126\n00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.110\nHow it's been interacted with?\n\n127\n00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.040\nAnd we can validate at any\nstage of the lifecycle.\n\n128\n00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.000\nfor the entire duration of that\nevidence being in our possession or\n\n129\n00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.120\nin the possession of the response\nteam when we capture that evidence,\n\n130\n00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.980\nwhat we call \"bagging and tagging\".\n\n131\n00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.930\nWhere we initially find that evidence and\nwe document it and remove it for\n\n132\n00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.360\nfurther investigation and storage,\nbacking, whatever facilities we may use.\n\n133\n00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.560\nWe're following forensic\ninvestigation procedures and\n\n134\n00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.960\nforensic analysis procedures.\n\n135\n00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.990\nSo, I want to make sure we're aware of\nthe fact that these things are methodical.\n\n136\n00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.860\nThey are meticulous.\n\n137\n00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.110\nYou must follow a very prescribed\nset of steps in order to engage\n\n138\n00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.160\nin these activities.\n\n139\n00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.220\nHave to make sure that evidence protection\nis at the forefront of everything we do.\n\n140\n00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.850\nAt every stage of the incident response\nhandling steps, all 17 of them.\n\n141\n00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.880\nWe should always be thinking\nabout evidence protection\n\n142\n00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.640\nas being a fundamental issue and\na concern for\n\n143\n00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.525\nus, but it is especially important\nas we get into steps 8 and\n\n144\n00:06:44.525 --> 00:06:48.665\n9 and 10, where we're we putting hands on\nthe machine and we're gathering evidence.\n\n145\n00:06:48.665 --> 00:06:51.455\nAnd we now have tangible information and\n\n146\n00:06:51.455 --> 00:06:55.435\ntangible data that we have to\nactually safeguard and interact with.\n\n147\n00:06:55.435 --> 00:06:59.170\nIt's important at every stage but\nit becomes critical as we actually produce\n\n148\n00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.380\nevidence that we have to interact with,\nand we also document and then remove,\n\n149\n00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.390\nand we've talked about some of the things\nlike dont just walk up to a machine and\n\n150\n00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:10.270\nstart unplugging things or start turning\nthings off without understanding or\n\n151\n00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.820\ncapturing accurately.\n\n152\n00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:12.890\nThe current state of the machine.\n\n153\n00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.820\nSo for instance,\nif we were to look at my machine or\n\n154\n00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.970\nmachines that are sitting on the desk\nhere, I know you can't really see them\n\n155\n00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.210\nper say but I'll describe what's going on\nto you here, you'd see I've got three or\n\n156\n00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.910\nfour cables coming out of\nthe machine that I'm displaying.\n\n157\n00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.950\nI've got a mouse that's a USB\nmouse plugged in on one side,\n\n158\n00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:32.000\nI have a USB drive on the other.\n\n159\n00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.840\nI've got a video out cable, so\n\n160\n00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.600\na display cable here,\ngot a power cable in the machine.\n\n161\n00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:41.840\nAnd we have to capture the order of\nthese cables, where they are, and\n\n162\n00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:42.710\nwhat side of the machine.\n\n163\n00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:44.050\nHow they're plugged in.\n\n164\n00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:48.849\nCentrally, the configuration and the\nspecification of these to understand part\n\n165\n00:07:48.849 --> 00:07:53.033\nof the evidence that's being captured\nassociated with this machine.\n\n166\n00:07:53.033 --> 00:07:55.455\nSo that we could accurately speak to, and\n\n167\n00:07:55.455 --> 00:07:59.538\nreproduce that evidence, either in\na court of law, or at an inquiry,\n\n168\n00:07:59.538 --> 00:08:04.244\nor at a hearing of some kind later So that\nwe have an accurate documentation of what\n\n169\n00:08:04.244 --> 00:08:09.250\nthe current state of the system was when\nwe came upon it, started to investigate.\n\n170\n00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.000\nBecause otherwise what can happen is,\n\n171\n00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.950\nsomebody can claim that that's\nnot how the system was set up.\n\n172\n00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:16.960\nSomebody can claim that that's\nnot indeed what was going on.\n\n173\n00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.570\nOr you didn't have that thumb drive in\ntheir at them, you had a different one.\n\n174\n00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:22.550\nNo wonder you found these things but\n\n175\n00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:24.440\ndidn't find these because\nthey weren't there.\n\n176\n00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.210\nWell, that may or\nmay not be the case, hard to say.\n\n177\n00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:31.540\nBut unless we know for\nsure what is there, call me a liar, right?\n\n178\n00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:35.707\nIt's my word against whoever\nis claiming the opposite, and\n\n179\n00:08:35.707 --> 00:08:40.215\nthere is no way to definitively\nknow who is right and who is wrong.\n\n180\n00:08:40.215 --> 00:08:41.970\nI'm not saying-\n&gt;&gt; Reasonable doubt.\n\n181\n00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:43.210\nWell, reasonable doubt, right?\n\n182\n00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:44.670\nI'm not saying that one person may or\n\n183\n00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:46.880\nmay not be more or\nless believable than the other.\n\n184\n00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.720\nI'm just pointing out that when you have\ncompetitive opinions about something,\n\n185\n00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.870\nit's sometimes very hard to discern which\none may be the accurate one, right?\n\n186\n00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:56.370\nSo, we wanna just understand that.\n\n187\n00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:57.309\nAnd so, as a result.\n\n188\n00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:02.980\nOne of the primary things we need to focus\non with regards to forensic analysis and\n\n189\n00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.130\nevidence protection is this methodical,\n\n190\n00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.990\nmeticulous approach to\nhow we capture evidence.\n\n191\n00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:13.490\nAnd you can't just walk up and\nsay okay, computer's being impounded.\n\n192\n00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:15.450\nAnd go ahead, put it in a bag.\n\n193\n00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:16.740\nLet's take it back to the shop.\n\n194\n00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:17.970\n&gt;&gt; You can't do that?\n\n195\n00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:18.768\nYou can't.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n196\n00:09:18.768 --> 00:09:21.150\n&gt;&gt; But when you do,\nwhat we call that actually?\n\n197\n00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:22.920\nWe have a name for that.\n\n198\n00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.670\n&gt;&gt; A resume generating event?\n\n199\n00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:25.660\n&gt;&gt; No.\nWe call it a Daniel.\n\n200\n00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:26.460\nThat's what we call it.\n\n201\n00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.300\nWe call it a Daniel.\n\n202\n00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:31.920\nSo if you do a Daniel, then you lead to an\nRGE, which is a resume generating event.\n\n203\n00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:36.040\nYou don't wanna have that happen, so all\njoking aside [LAUGH] right you certainly,\n\n204\n00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.980\nlook people do all sorts\nof crazy things and\n\n205\n00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.890\nI'm not suggesting that\npeople don't do this, but\n\n206\n00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:45.415\nwhat we're trying to point out in a light\nhearted way is that if people do this.\n\n207\n00:09:45.415 --> 00:09:50.125\nYou essentially have probably blown any\nopportunity to be able to take that\n\n208\n00:09:50.125 --> 00:09:54.255\nevidence and present it in anything\nbeyond a written report that may or\n\n209\n00:09:54.255 --> 00:09:57.495\nmay not be accurate, because there's\nno way to validate what you found and\n\n210\n00:09:57.495 --> 00:10:01.055\nno way to assure beyond a reasonable\ndoubt the term Daniel used.\n\n211\n00:10:01.055 --> 00:10:02.745\nI like that term a lot.\n\n212\n00:10:02.745 --> 00:10:03.985\nReasonable doubt, right?\n\n213\n00:10:03.985 --> 00:10:05.500\nBecause that's the standard.\n\n214\n00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.710\nThat is the standard that we\nmeasure against in a court of law.\n\n215\n00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:12.150\nIf there's reasonable doubt\nthen we're not allowed to\n\n216\n00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:15.400\nsay authoritatively that that did occur,\nwe're not allowed to introduce\n\n217\n00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.715\nthat evidence in an authoritative way\nif there's reasonable doubt because.\n\n218\n00:10:18.715 --> 00:10:21.095\nChances are good that it is accurate but\n\n219\n00:10:21.095 --> 00:10:23.705\nchances are also good that\nit may not be accurate.\n\n220\n00:10:23.705 --> 00:10:28.325\nAnd we can't bias or\nin any way impact the impartiality of that\n\n221\n00:10:28.325 --> 00:10:31.135\nproceeding by introducing evidence\nthat may not be accurate.\n\n222\n00:10:31.135 --> 00:10:34.245\nThat's one of the tenets of any\nkind of law system anywhere in\n\n223\n00:10:34.245 --> 00:10:35.925\nthe world regardless of where you are.\n\n224\n00:10:35.925 --> 00:10:39.770\nSo, we do need to understand\nthat as security professionals,\n\n225\n00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.160\nas incident handlers,\nthis is our most fundamental,\n\n226\n00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.690\nour most core,\nour most important responsibility.\n\n227\n00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:48.560\nIt’s our most solemn\nresponsibility in the things we\n\n228\n00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.260\nmust take seriously no matter what.\n\n229\n00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.800\nWe joke a lot about a lot of stuff, but\nit’s important for you to understand\n\n230\n00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.780\nthe importance and the sanctity of this\nparticular conversation here beer.\n\n231\n00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:01.300\nBecause if you don’t get this right,\nit's not that you haven't done your job,\n\n232\n00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:03.170\nbut you haven't done it the right way.\n\n233\n00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:04.940\nAnd if you don't do it the right way,\n\n234\n00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:08.730\nthen unfortunately you haven't done\nanything of value for the organisation.\n\n235\n00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:10.210\nYou may have stopped the breach.\n\n236\n00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:12.590\nYou may have returned\nthe system to normalcy.\n\n237\n00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:14.290\nYou may have saved the day.\n\n238\n00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:17.740\nBut unfortunately,\nyou have left out the most important part.\n\n239\n00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:21.240\nYou've left out the ability to then go\nafter the people that caused the damage.\n\n240\n00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:25.590\nAnd potentially make them accountable and\nif necessary if there is an option\n\n241\n00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:27.890\nrecover damages from them monetarily,\nright among other things.\n\n242\n00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:31.100\n&gt;&gt; Yup you won the battle but\nyou lost the war as it were.\n\n243\n00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.703\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like my explanation.\n\n244\n00:11:32.703 --> 00:11:35.110\n&gt;&gt; That's because your a very selfish man.\n\n245\n00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:38.770\n&gt;&gt; It was longer but\nI like talking so that was just.\n\n246\n00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:42.050\nI'm going with that but yes you lost.\n\n247\n00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:44.080\nYou won the battle but lost the war.\n\n248\n00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:44.760\nI like that.\nThat's\n\n249\n00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.430\na good of thinking about it as well.\n\n250\n00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:50.440\nSo just make sure you understand\nthe concept here of forensic analysis.\n\n251\n00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.550\nKeeping in mind that we've done\na whole series, Daniel and I, on CHFI,\n\n252\n00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:59.690\nanother EC counsel certification,\nthe forensic investigative credential.\n\n253\n00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:02.955\nWe go in depth for God,\nit seemed like a year, right?\n\n254\n00:12:02.955 --> 00:12:04.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Forever and a day.\n\n255\n00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:07.900\nWe go in depth there into what\nthis exact process looks like.\n\n256\n00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:08.780\nThat certification,\n\n257\n00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:12.190\nthat series of episodes we did on\nthat entire body of knowledge.\n\n258\n00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:14.470\nIf you have access to it,\nI encourage you to watch it at some point.\n\n259\n00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:17.800\nIf not, think about reading up on it\na little bit, understand more about it.\n\n260\n00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:22.160\nBut that particular area of knowledge\nright there takes item number 10 and\n\n261\n00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.550\nnumber 11 on this screen,\n\n262\n00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:28.170\nblows it up into an entire discussion\nof exactly what to do there.\n\n263\n00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:31.200\nWe're giving you just a very high level\ndiscussion on what that looks like.\n\n264\n00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.860\nWe get into the very specific nitty gritty\ndetails of what that looks like in those\n\n265\n00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:35.450\nconversations.\n\n266\n00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:38.310\nSo, encourage you just to at least\nthink about that as a way to build\n\n267\n00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:39.150\nknowledge there.\n\n268\n00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:42.830\nBecause incident handlers\nhave to be forensically\n\n269\n00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:45.320\ntrained to do their job the right way or,\nand\n\n270\n00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.490\nthis is important, you'll have to\nthen partner with people that are.\n\n271\n00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:53.670\nNobody says you as an incident handler\nhave to necessarily be the person\n\n272\n00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:57.380\nthat understands how to forensically\nanalyse and protect evidence properly.\n\n273\n00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:00.860\nBut you have to have people on the\nincident response team that know how to do\n\n274\n00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:05.250\nthat and those are the people that should\nbe deployed to deals with steps 9, 10,\n\n275\n00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:06.310\nand 11, right?\n\n276\n00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:07.620\nAs opposed to perhaps, you.\n\n277\n00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.860\nIf you are the incident manager.\n\n278\n00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:13.090\nIf you are somebody who\nhas skills in other areas,\n\n279\n00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:14.880\nyou may be doing different things.\n\n280\n00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.590\nBut remember, it's a team effort.\n\n281\n00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:20.640\nIt's not an individual that does\nall of these steps necessarily.\n\n282\n00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.990\nI play a lot of these different\nroles on various teams,\n\n283\n00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:25.870\ndepending on the needs of\nthe customers I deal with.\n\n284\n00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:30.540\nI spent a great deal of time actually\ndoing incident investigation, collection,\n\n285\n00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:31.860\nforensic analysis of data.\n\n286\n00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.190\nIt's one of the things\nthat I know a lot about.\n\n287\n00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:38.210\nBut I also spend a lot of time dealing\nwith initial incident recording and\n\n288\n00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:42.370\nresponse, and overseeing and\nmanaging incident response teams.\n\n289\n00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:47.010\nOn demand on behalf of customers that have\nthat capability developed internally but\n\n290\n00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:50.020\nneed the project management\noversight experience\n\n291\n00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:53.220\nto coordinate that from a more\nsenior security perspective.\n\n292\n00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:57.150\nSomebody who has the policy and the\nmanagement background to understand how to\n\n293\n00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:00.670\ncoordinate those responses is\nequally important to the team.\n\n294\n00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:03.000\nSo, you may fall into one or\nmore of these categories.\n\n295\n00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.030\nSo, just understand that and\nidentify that as well.\n\n296\n00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:09.060\nNotification of external agencies,\nwe've talked about this.\n\n297\n00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:14.060\nI mentioned that we would do this if and\nwhen there was a policy and\n\n298\n00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:18.450\nor there is a thought process\nfrom a regulatory perspective\n\n299\n00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:21.040\nthat would drive us to\nhave a need to do this.\n\n300\n00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:24.720\nthere's no reason to go outside\nthe organization If there is\n\n301\n00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.170\nno crime that's been committed you\ndon't have to call law enforcement\n\n302\n00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:30.450\nbecause somebody put\nmalware on your computer.\n\n303\n00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:34.080\nIt's not required but\nif they put malware on your computer and\n\n304\n00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.510\nn the process stole\n$50,000 worths of good and\n\n305\n00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.670\nservices from your company then\nyou better call law enforcement.\n\n306\n00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:43.270\nBecause now there's been\na crime that's been committed.\n\n307\n00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:46.340\nThere's a financial wrong\nthat has to be righted, and\n\n308\n00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.100\nlaw enforcement has to\nbe involved to do that.\n\n309\n00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:52.620\nAnd in a way, it may allow you to go after\nthe perpetrators and seek remuneration,\n\n310\n00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.280\nessentially seek damages, right.\n\n311\n00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:59.090\nBut if all they did was break into one\nmachine, put some malware on there, and\n\n312\n00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:00.610\nthat was the end of it.\n\n313\n00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:03.810\nLaw enforcement's just, unfortunately,\nnot the appropriate pathway for\n\n314\n00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:06.860\nyou to engage with cuz they're not gonna\nhave anything that they can offer you\n\n315\n00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.990\nthat's gonna be of help in that situation,\nright?\n\n316\n00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:12.510\nThey're gonna politely tell you that they\njust are not gonna be the responding\n\n317\n00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:16.030\nagency you should be talking to and\nyou should deal with that internally.\n\n318\n00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:20.350\nSo you wanna make sure you understand\nthat When it comes down to regulatory\n\n319\n00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:26.040\ncompliance and statutory compliance\nyou have to be educated ahead of time\n\n320\n00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:31.170\nas to what those requirements may be and\nknow that is there is a regulatory concern\n\n321\n00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:36.860\nthat you take the steps as early in\nthe process you need to ensure compliance\n\n322\n00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:41.010\nthis is one of those tricky things right\nIf you're in a regulated industry,\n\n323\n00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:46.030\nfinance for instance, healthcare,\ninsurance, biopharmaceuticals,\n\n324\n00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:50.600\noil and natural gas and extracted\nminerals, and those kind of industries.\n\n325\n00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.809\nAll of them, without exception,\nnot just here in the United States but\n\n326\n00:15:53.809 --> 00:15:57.199\nin many countries around the world,\nare regulated by their governments.\n\n327\n00:15:57.199 --> 00:16:00.712\nThe appropriate agencies based on\nwhatever country you may be involved in.\n\n328\n00:16:00.712 --> 00:16:04.942\nAnd if you are operating one or more of\nthose industries, you have a legal and\n\n329\n00:16:04.942 --> 00:16:09.440\nregulatory responsibility to uphold as\npart of being a security professional,\n\n330\n00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.370\nan IT professional, and instant responder.\n\n331\n00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:17.163\nIf you're not educated on what that is,\nyou have a major problem [LAUGH] on your\n\n332\n00:16:17.163 --> 00:16:22.034\nhands, because you're gonna unfortunately\nwind up being either too early or\n\n333\n00:16:22.034 --> 00:16:25.530\ntoo late to the party with\nregards to what you need to do.\n\n334\n00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:29.721\nThere is never such a there is\nusually not such a thing as calling in\n\n335\n00:16:29.721 --> 00:16:32.467\nthe appropriate authorities too early but\n\n336\n00:16:32.467 --> 00:16:37.591\nthe problem maybe that you may put a phone\ncall into company X, business unit Y.\n\n337\n00:16:37.591 --> 00:16:40.802\nWhatever it is whatever\nthe regulatory concern is outside and\n\n338\n00:16:40.802 --> 00:16:45.080\nsay hey we think we have a breach or\nan instance that needs to be investigated.\n\n339\n00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.990\nThey're gonna ask you some information.\n\n340\n00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:49.820\nIf you can't answer those questions,\nthey're gonna say great,\n\n341\n00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:53.220\ncall us back when you actually know what\nyou have on your hands, because we may or\n\n342\n00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:54.800\nmay not be able to help you.\n\n343\n00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.520\nSo when I say too early to the party,\n\n344\n00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.380\nwhat I mean is,\nyou have to have done identification.\n\n345\n00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:03.180\nYou have to have engaged in incident\nrecording and initial response.\n\n346\n00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:08.251\nAnd communication of the incident in order\nto validate that those steps are good and\n\n347\n00:17:08.251 --> 00:17:11.230\nthat you can then talk to\nthe regulatory agency.\n\n348\n00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.528\nSo that they can be made\naware of the incident and\n\n349\n00:17:13.528 --> 00:17:16.370\nthey can choose how to attach and\ninteract with you.\n\n350\n00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:18.760\nIf you can't explain to them\nwhat's going on authoritatively,\n\n351\n00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.350\nthey're not gonna be able to interact\nwith you in a meaningful way.\n\n352\n00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:24.480\nSo there is such a thing as being\ntoo early to the party here, but\n\n353\n00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.950\nalso being too late.\n\n354\n00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:31.894\nIf you notify the external agency after\nthe fact when you have finished step 17.\n\n355\n00:17:31.894 --> 00:17:36.448\nAnd there's a regulatory or a legal and\nstatutory concern that says you need to\n\n356\n00:17:36.448 --> 00:17:40.770\nnotify them, you know back up around\nstep four and you don't do that.\n\n357\n00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:44.698\nYou may actually be subject to search,\nseizure, fine and\n\n358\n00:17:44.698 --> 00:17:48.158\njail time as a result of violating one or\nmore laws.\n\n359\n00:17:48.158 --> 00:17:49.772\nAnd heads of companies and\n\n360\n00:17:49.772 --> 00:17:53.807\nIT professionals that manage\nsystems in companies are not immune\n\n361\n00:17:53.807 --> 00:17:58.650\nfrom prosecution just because the system\nwas broken into by somebody else.\n\n362\n00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:01.855\nWe may not prosecute you in other words\nfor the breach, we may prosecute you for\n\n363\n00:18:01.855 --> 00:18:05.315\nnot following the regulatory\nrequirements for reporting the breach.\n\n364\n00:18:05.315 --> 00:18:09.848\nAnd that's equally problematic and you\ncould be equally culpable to the incident\n\n365\n00:18:09.848 --> 00:18:13.671\nor for the incident because you did\nnot report it in a timely fashion.\n\n366\n00:18:13.671 --> 00:18:14.842\nYou could go to jail.\n\n367\n00:18:14.842 --> 00:18:16.412\nThere may be financial penalties.\n\n368\n00:18:16.412 --> 00:18:17.867\nWho knows what there could be.\n\n369\n00:18:17.867 --> 00:18:19.512\nThere's a lot of concerns here.\n\n370\n00:18:19.512 --> 00:18:21.632\nAnd so\nyou really have to educate yourself and\n\n371\n00:18:21.632 --> 00:18:26.362\nunderstand those issues as part of this\nprocess as being an incident responder.\n\n372\n00:18:26.362 --> 00:18:27.502\nIt's very, very important.\n\n373\n00:18:27.502 --> 00:18:31.422\nPeople don't often understand that there\nmay be liabilities that they're actually\n\n374\n00:18:31.422 --> 00:18:33.462\non the hook for\ndepending on what we're doing.\n\n375\n00:18:33.462 --> 00:18:36.620\nEradication involves removal of the cause\nof the incident, as I mentioned.\n\n376\n00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:41.130\nThat's where we go in, we actually try to\nget rid of the malware, undo the settings,\n\n377\n00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:42.350\nwhatever it was.\n\n378\n00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:45.650\nAnd then system recovery, that's\nwhere we actually put the system back\n\n379\n00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:48.520\nto whatever would be classified as quote,\nunquote normal, right?\n\n380\n00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:53.465\nSo normal operational environmental\ncapabilities to restore things\n\n381\n00:18:53.465 --> 00:18:54.644\nof that nature.\n\n382\n00:18:54.644 --> 00:18:57.372\nIt helps to have baselines for\nthis kind of stuff of course, so\n\n383\n00:18:57.372 --> 00:18:59.109\nthink about that and keep that in mind.\n\n384\n00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:06.350\nIncident documentation should be as\nthorough, as detailed, and as applicable\n\n385\n00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:10.420\nin terms of understanding what's going\non to the specific incident as possible.\n\n386\n00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:11.685\nBut there are some baselines.\n\n387\n00:19:11.685 --> 00:19:14.015\nThings that we just have to\nhave there no matter what.\n\n388\n00:19:14.015 --> 00:19:16.915\nWe should describe the breach\nin as much detail as we can.\n\n389\n00:19:16.915 --> 00:19:17.975\nWe should understand and\n\n390\n00:19:17.975 --> 00:19:22.225\nhave a good, thorough story around the\ndetails of actions that will take place.\n\n391\n00:19:22.225 --> 00:19:24.417\nThings like who was involved.\n\n392\n00:19:24.417 --> 00:19:26.157\nWhat was the incident timeline?\n\n393\n00:19:26.157 --> 00:19:29.907\nWhat was the root cause or what is\nthe root cause analysis of the incident?\n\n394\n00:19:29.907 --> 00:19:34.547\nSo wanna answer those question, be able\nto profoundly explain them in detail and\n\n395\n00:19:34.547 --> 00:19:37.183\nallow for broad communication of them.\n\n396\n00:19:37.183 --> 00:19:39.603\nThe four important\nelements in any security\n\n397\n00:19:39.603 --> 00:19:42.993\nthought process around documentation\nreally deal with answering.\n\n398\n00:19:42.993 --> 00:19:45.749\nIt's actually the five overall, right?\n\n399\n00:19:45.749 --> 00:19:47.413\nWell no, actually it's the five Ws of the.\n\n400\n00:19:47.413 --> 00:19:48.743\nIt's the sixth overall.\n\n401\n00:19:48.743 --> 00:19:49.783\nLet me get them correctly.\n\n402\n00:19:49.783 --> 00:19:53.573\nBut it is the who, what, when, where, why\nand how conversation that we talk about.\n\n403\n00:19:53.573 --> 00:19:58.703\nDocumentation really needs to address and\ndeal with the answers to those questions.\n\n404\n00:19:58.703 --> 00:20:00.960\nIf it does so successfully, It's thorough.\n\n405\n00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:03.410\nIt's good, it's at the right level.\n\n406\n00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:07.180\nIf we have blanks or holes in that story,\nwe need to go back to the well and\n\n407\n00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:09.140\ndo a little more digging,\nas they say, right?\n\n408\n00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:10.950\nSo, incident damage and cost assessment.\n\n409\n00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:15.570\nThis may be a quantitative risk analysis,\nor\n\n410\n00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:19.690\nrisk assessment of the incident to\nunderstand what it may cost us.\n\n411\n00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:23.300\nThis may be a qualitative, even though\nqualitative doesn't necessarily lead\n\n412\n00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:26.860\ndirectly to a dollars and\ncents damage assessment.\n\n413\n00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:31.330\nBut it may lead to the tangible and\nintangible understandings of those costs.\n\n414\n00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:32.917\nSo think about quantitative qualitative.\n\n415\n00:20:32.917 --> 00:20:35.260\nWe've talked about that\nin other conversations.\n\n416\n00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:37.185\nWe may be doing some of that here.\n\n417\n00:20:37.185 --> 00:20:41.811\nCBA, cost benefit analysis, looking at\nthe ROI, the return on investment around\n\n418\n00:20:41.811 --> 00:20:45.723\nthe counter measures and\nthe liabilities that we're encountering.\n\n419\n00:20:45.723 --> 00:20:48.783\nAnd all those things would get\nlumped into this kind of a step and\n\n420\n00:20:48.783 --> 00:20:50.560\nthis kind of conversation.\n\n421\n00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.350\nReview and update response policies.\n\n422\n00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:54.490\nThis is, sometimes it's called the PIR.\n\n423\n00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:56.180\nA post implementation review.\n\n424\n00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:57.720\nSometimes called a post mortem.\n\n425\n00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:01.174\nSometimes called a lessons learned\nproject management kinda 101, right?\n\n426\n00:21:01.174 --> 00:21:05.400\nYou hear one or more of those terms very\noften in project management conversations.\n\n427\n00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:09.640\nThis is about looking back after the fact,\ndissecting and\n\n428\n00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.800\nunderstanding the key takeaways,\ndocumenting them.\n\n429\n00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:16.120\nAnd then rolling that knowledge\nforward through an iterative and\n\n430\n00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:20.600\na continual improvement process\nthat allows us to become smarter.\n\n431\n00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.600\nSo that we don't repeat\nthe same mistakes over and\n\n432\n00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:23.950\nover and over again over time right?\n\n433\n00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:27.430\nSo if we know for\na fact that we were hacked and\n\n434\n00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:31.410\nthe incident occurred because we did not\napply the latest security patches from\n\n435\n00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:34.530\nthe vendor in a timely fashion\nwell you know guess what?\n\n436\n00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:38.770\nWe should learn that going forward we\ngotta tighten up that patch management and\n\n437\n00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:43.380\npatch application cycle so that we don't\nhave a six or seven or eight week lag or\n\n438\n00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:44.600\nwhatever it would have been.\n\n439\n00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:48.710\nBut rather we have a maybe two to\nfour week lag, or one week lag, or\n\n440\n00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:51.900\nwhatever we find is the appropriate\narea that we settle on.\n\n441\n00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:54.850\nThis is not about hey,\nit's gonna be exactly that.\n\n442\n00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:58.300\nRather let's broadly apply guidance and\nknowledge that makes us smarter,\n\n443\n00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:02.610\nand then let's obviously operationalize\nthat and localize that to the needs,\n\n444\n00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:04.240\nthe context of our situation.\n\n445\n00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:07.850\nBut let's take the broad idea and\nfigure out how to apply it to our systems.\n\n446\n00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:10.160\nThat's really what incident response,\nin terms of review and\n\n447\n00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.350\nupdate response policy, speaks to.\n\n448\n00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:16.340\nAnd why it's so important for\nus to be aware of those things.\n\n449\n00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:18.603\nAll right, so\nas we wrap up our conversation,\n\n450\n00:22:18.603 --> 00:22:21.273\nwith regards to instant response and\nhandling steps,\n\n451\n00:22:21.273 --> 00:22:24.712\nwanna make sure we understand that\nit's the start to finish, right.\n\n452\n00:22:24.712 --> 00:22:29.201\nThe entire life cycle here, steps 1\nthrough 17 that we need to understand,\n\n453\n00:22:29.201 --> 00:22:30.630\nyou need to understand,\n\n454\n00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:34.840\nif you're looking to become\na certified instant response handler.\n\n455\n00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:37.600\nYou're gonna be expected to speak\nknowledgeably about these steps.\n\n456\n00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.600\nYou should be able to summarize,\n\n457\n00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.350\nexplain a little bit about\nwhat happens in each step.\n\n458\n00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:44.240\nMaybe a sentence or two would be good.\n\n459\n00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:47.710\nYou don't have to go into the detail\nthat some of these conversations have\n\n460\n00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:51.130\nled to with our discussion with you,\nbut if you can distil that down,\n\n461\n00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:54.970\nsummarize that, capture the essence of it,\nI think you're in a good place.\n\n462\n00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:57.350\nI think you have a good amount of\nknowledge if you could do that.\n\n463\n00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:59.450\nIf you're doing this\nalready professionally,\n\n464\n00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:02.630\nyou're applying these steps and you're\ninteracting with them on a daily basis.\n\n465\n00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:07.160\nJust keep in mind that the localized\nknowledge you bring to\n\n466\n00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:10.770\nthe table in this kind of\na discussion is incredibly valuable.\n\n467\n00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:13.110\nBut for purposes of exam preparation,\n\n468\n00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:17.690\nwe have to broaden that conversation\nback out to the theory as well, right?\n\n469\n00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:20.980\nAnd we have to understand that\nyou may bundle steps 9, 10, and\n\n470\n00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:22.750\n11 together as I suggested.\n\n471\n00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:26.495\nI do and many practitioners do in\nthe real world and simply say,\n\n472\n00:23:26.495 --> 00:23:30.394\nwe do forensically sound data\ncollection and analysis, right?\n\n473\n00:23:30.394 --> 00:23:32.068\nWe kind of bundle all that together.\n\n474\n00:23:32.068 --> 00:23:34.470\nBut for purposes of exam preparation,\n\n475\n00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:37.780\nyou should definitely be prepared to\nunderstand that those steps are seen as\n\n476\n00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:40.440\nbeing distinctly different\nin our methodology here.\n\n477\n00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.140\nAnd we don't wanna miss that.\n\n478\n00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:46.070\nAnd miss out on the opportunity to be\ncorrect if asked about it, because we\n\n479\n00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:50.160\nsimply bundle them and say, yeah,\nit's kind of all that in just one area.\n\n480\n00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:53.658\nAnd we miss the subtlety of being\nable to answer the right questions.\n\n481\n00:23:53.658 --> 00:23:55.917\nSo just some thoughts,\njust some things to consider and\n\n482\n00:23:55.917 --> 00:23:59.310\nthink about as we wrap up the conversation\nhere with regards to instance handling.\n\n483\n00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:03.220\n&gt;&gt; Well there are definitely a lot of\nsteps involved in instant handling and\n\n484\n00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:06.230\nthe good news is Adam you've done\na great job of Itemizing them,\n\n485\n00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:07.420\ngiving us some methodology.\n\n486\n00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:10.809\nThings we might not even\nhave thought to do.\n\n487\n00:24:10.809 --> 00:24:14.026\nSome of the people that have come together\nand made sure that each one of those\n\n488\n00:24:14.026 --> 00:24:16.451\nthings are accounted for or\nput in a checklist as it were.\n\n489\n00:24:16.451 --> 00:24:20.114\nSo that we have a nice method of logical\nprogression moving through these things,\n\n490\n00:24:20.114 --> 00:24:23.630\nnot forgetting anything,\nmaking sure everything is done correctly.\n\n491\n00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:27.160\nSo that, at the end of the day,\nif there was a bad actor or threat actor,\n\n492\n00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.920\nwe might be able to prosecute if\nthat's the road we need to take.\n\n493\n00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:33.294\nOr at least mitigate and\ncontrol the problem that has occurred,\n\n494\n00:24:33.294 --> 00:24:34.864\nthe incident that occurred.\n\n495\n00:24:34.864 --> 00:24:36.100\n&gt;&gt; I prefer seek and\ndestroy, but that's just me.\n\n496\n00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.813\n&gt;&gt; Seek and destroy, there you go.\n\n497\n00:24:37.813 --> 00:24:38.426\n&gt;&gt; Eradicate.\n\n498\n00:24:38.426 --> 00:24:39.351\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n499\n00:24:39.351 --> 00:24:42.018\nthat's where we get a gun,\nwe add a little bit of this.\n\n500\n00:24:42.018 --> 00:24:43.638\nAnd we go find the guy\nthat did this stuff.\n\n501\n00:24:43.638 --> 00:24:44.902\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n502\n00:24:44.902 --> 00:24:45.611\n&gt;&gt; That's a joke.\n\n503\n00:24:45.611 --> 00:24:49.875\n[LAUGH] That being said, it is time for\nus to sign off for ITPro.TV.\n\n504\n00:24:49.875 --> 00:24:53.600\nI do thank you guys for watching, but\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n505\n00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:54.809\n&gt;&gt; I am Adam Gordon.\n\n506\n00:24:54.809 --> 00:24:55.967\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you next

00:00:12.570\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.510\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, welcome\nto another great episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.050\nI am your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n6\n00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.880\nin today's episode we are back\nwith more on our ECIH series.\n\n7\n00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.656\nAnd of course joining us back for\nthat conversation is our good friend,\n\n8\n00:00:28.656 --> 00:00:32.521\nmentor, our magi,\nis that what it is, a magi?\n\n9\n00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:34.009\nThe guy [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I have no clue where you're going\n\n10\n00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:34.630\nwith this some.\n\n11\n00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.770\nI'm just gonna smile politely, say yes and\nnot make any sudden movements so\n\n12\n00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.910\nthat you don't get violent.\n\n13\n00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.790\nSo yes, that's exactly what it was.\n\n14\n00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.290\nThank you for that thoroughly and\na very confusing introduction sir,\n\n15\n00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.020\nI appreciate that.\n\n16\n00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.860\nSo it is always a pleasure to\nbe back here with you Daniel and\n\n17\n00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.950\nof course all your alter egos as well.\n\n18\n00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.000\nAnd let us continue our discussion.\n\n19\n00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.470\nWe were here talking if I'm not mistaken\nabout incident matter were we not?\n\n20\n00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:57.100\n&gt;&gt; We were.\n\n21\n00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.840\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we are gonna continue\ntalking about incident handling,\n\n22\n00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.850\nincident management and\nall things incident related.\n\n23\n00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.350\nAnd when we talked in\nour last conversations\n\n24\n00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.950\nabout as I think you called it my\nlong list of incident handling steps.\n\n25\n00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:10.710\n&gt;&gt; A myriad.\n\n26\n00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.780\n&gt;&gt; A myriad of steps.\n\n27\n00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.938\nAll 17 of them if you have not seen those\ntwo episodes that go through that with\n\n28\n00:01:15.938 --> 00:01:20.159\nyou, obviously I would encourage you to\ntake a look at the stuff that's prior to\n\n29\n00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.821\nthis episode to have the context and\nthe flavor of what we're doing.\n\n30\n00:01:23.821 --> 00:01:28.863\nKind of like seasoning be an instant\nincident management seasoning.\n\n31\n00:01:28.863 --> 00:01:31.565\nYou could just sprinkle it liberally\nacross the organization and\n\n32\n00:01:31.565 --> 00:01:33.147\nyou would have incident management.\n\n33\n00:01:33.147 --> 00:01:34.807\n&gt;&gt; Next to Mrs.\nDash at the local grocery store-\n\n34\n00:01:34.807 --> 00:01:35.567\n&gt;&gt; It would be Mr.\n\n35\n00:01:35.567 --> 00:01:37.441\nIncident Management and Mrs. Dash.\n\n36\n00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:40.131\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The yield in the egg.\n\n37\n00:01:40.131 --> 00:01:43.637\n&gt;&gt; Yet another product developed here\nat IT Pro TV by Adam and myself.\n\n38\n00:01:43.637 --> 00:01:45.850\n&gt;&gt; In the minds of Daniel and Adam.\n\n39\n00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.225\nThey're just scary what comes out\nof the confluence of time and\n\n40\n00:01:49.225 --> 00:01:51.510\nopportunities we spend time together.\n\n41\n00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.788\n&gt;&gt; God help us [LAUGH].\n\n42\n00:01:52.788 --> 00:01:54.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All of us.\n\n43\n00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.280\nAll right, so, when we are talking about\nincident management, we're gonna and\n\n44\n00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.700\nkind of pick up the thread.\n\n45\n00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.890\nFrom where we have been with\nregard to incident handling,\n\n46\n00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.390\nwe talked a lot about the steps involved.\n\n47\n00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.940\nWhat do we do?\n\n48\n00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.670\nWhat's the methodology, as you said,\nthe myriad of steps we have to go through?\n\n49\n00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.950\nThe specifics and the mechanics of\nwhat we need to do in what order, and\n\n50\n00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.150\nto what end and for what purpose.\n\n51\n00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.700\nWhat we then have to think about and\nfocus on is what is the coordination and\n\n52\n00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.260\nthe coordinating activities and the role\nof coordination in incident handling.\n\n53\n00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.977\nThis is where incident\nmanagement comes in.\n\n54\n00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:28.837\nLike all good systems, like all good\nprocesses, like all good activities,\n\n55\n00:02:28.837 --> 00:02:33.049\nwe have people and experts that\nare gonna be able to execute and do.\n\n56\n00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:37.472\nWe have people and experts that are gonna\noversee and help us to ensure we're doing\n\n57\n00:02:37.472 --> 00:02:40.670\nthe right things at the right time,\nfor the right reason.\n\n58\n00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.440\nBut also, first and foremost, they're\ngonna coordinate all those activities of\n\n59\n00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.130\nall the individuals that are executing\nto ensure that we get to the end result.\n\n60\n00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.340\nThe point that we want to be at\nin a way that makes sense, and\n\n61\n00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.850\nthat we can actually provide or\nfind value through.\n\n62\n00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.160\nAnd so if we don't have management, if we\ndon't have coordination and oversight,\n\n63\n00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.790\nit's difficult for us to understand if\nwe have been able to declare a victory,\n\n64\n00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.750\nbecause we've done something successfully.\n\n65\n00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.680\nIt's difficult for us to communicate\nthat value to stakeholders, and\n\n66\n00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.780\nto decision makers in the business.\n\n67\n00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.103\nAnd it's difficult for all of the\nconstituents, all of the individual actors\n\n68\n00:03:16.103 --> 00:03:19.705\nthat are executing one or\nmore of the steps in incident handling,\n\n69\n00:03:19.705 --> 00:03:22.739\nto understand if their\nactivities have come to an end.\n\n70\n00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.440\nIf they have to continue, if they have to\npartner, if they have to report out, up,\n\n71\n00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.290\nor around what is going on.\n\n72\n00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.311\nAnd we need that overarching glue\nthat kinda holds this together and\n\n73\n00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:34.941\nprovides direction to us.\n\n74\n00:03:34.941 --> 00:03:38.993\nAnd this is where incident management\ncomes in and then management to support\n\n75\n00:03:38.993 --> 00:03:42.565\nhandling of diagnosis of and\nultimately the resolution of events.\n\n76\n00:03:42.565 --> 00:03:47.508\nHere is what incident management speaks\nto, the main objectives with regards to\n\n77\n00:03:47.508 --> 00:03:51.954\nincident management, I mean things\nthat we are looking to accomplish.\n\n78\n00:03:51.954 --> 00:03:53.866\nAre going to be, I should say.\n\n79\n00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:55.920\nThe ability for us,\nas I mentioned, is to coordinate.\n\n80\n00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.130\nTo really act as the communication\npathway and the manager\n\n81\n00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.600\nof information and flow back and forth\nwith regards to what we are doing, right?\n\n82\n00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.870\nSo wanna think about that,\nwanna have a sense of that.\n\n83\n00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.690\nWhen we often talk about management,\nright, just generically.\n\n84\n00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.610\nWhether you're having a conversation\nwith a peer, a colleague,\n\n85\n00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.060\na co-worker, anybody, and\nyou mention management, right.\n\n86\n00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.550\nWhat you often hear and think about,\n\n87\n00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:24.270\nis this more senior level overseeing\nkind of activity enrolling.\n\n88\n00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.790\nThat's what incident management\nshould be thought of, but\n\n89\n00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.970\nwe also wanna put it\nin the proper context.\n\n90\n00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.400\nIncident managers are part of\nthe incident response team.\n\n91\n00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.015\nThey are simply a coordinating effort\nof coordinating thought process in and\n\n92\n00:04:37.015 --> 00:04:38.867\namong the members of the team.\n\n93\n00:04:38.867 --> 00:04:43.136\nSo, wanna prevent incidence and\nattacks by making sure we're tightening up\n\n94\n00:04:43.136 --> 00:04:46.039\ncommunication, tightening\nup the coordination.\n\n95\n00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:50.737\nRequired to ensure that the proper\ncontrols and counter measures are applied\n\n96\n00:04:50.737 --> 00:04:55.071\nthat we're doing so in a timely fashion,\nthat we have documentation,\n\n97\n00:04:55.071 --> 00:05:00.170\nauditability, and visibility and\nverification, to the things we are doing.\n\n98\n00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.028\nWanna create awareness and\nfocus on awareness and\n\n99\n00:05:03.028 --> 00:05:07.188\nthe dissemination of knowledge\nthrough standardized communication.\n\n100\n00:05:07.188 --> 00:05:11.900\nAnd clear and positive communication in\nand among the members of the organization.\n\n101\n00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.320\nWanna monitor and test infrastructure.\n\n102\n00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.484\nConstantly probing for, looking for\nweaknesses, number of vulnerabilities or\n\n103\n00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:19.217\nweaknesses.\n\n104\n00:05:19.217 --> 00:05:24.677\nSo things like vulnerability assessments,\npenetration tests would be carried out and\n\n105\n00:05:24.677 --> 00:05:27.934\ndone under the guise of\nperhaps incident managers.\n\n106\n00:05:27.934 --> 00:05:32.599\nAnd communicate information to the other\nteam members about the incidents that\n\n107\n00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:36.091\nare going on either active that\nare being chased right now.\n\n108\n00:05:36.091 --> 00:05:39.049\nOr perhaps recently in the past\nthat have been finished up and\n\n109\n00:05:39.049 --> 00:05:40.910\nthat we wanna essentially close out.\n\n110\n00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.705\nCreate the historical conduit,\nso we can go back and\n\n111\n00:05:44.705 --> 00:05:48.232\nresearch incidents over time and\nallow us to learn from them and benefit\n\n112\n00:05:48.232 --> 00:05:52.316\nfrom the investment of time and energy\nthat was made to mitigate those incidents.\n\n113\n00:05:52.316 --> 00:05:56.039\nThey need all of these things are gonna\nbe a part of the responsibilities and\n\n114\n00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:58.298\nthe ultimate goals of incident management.\n\n115\n00:05:58.298 --> 00:06:01.576\nThere's a lot of different activities\nthat incident managers may engage in.\n\n116\n00:06:01.576 --> 00:06:05.375\nWe have a long laundry list of things\nthat potentially fond of this but\n\n117\n00:06:05.375 --> 00:06:09.437\nsome of the more obvious ones I\nmentioned vulnerability assessments so,\n\n118\n00:06:09.437 --> 00:06:11.483\nengaging vulnerability analysis.\n\n119\n00:06:11.483 --> 00:06:15.729\nMaybe an activity that incidence\nmanagement would interact with,\n\n120\n00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:19.008\nintrusion detection and or\nintrusion prevention so\n\n121\n00:06:19.008 --> 00:06:23.924\nthe use of over side of application of\ndesign and deployment of IDS intrusion,\n\n122\n00:06:23.924 --> 00:06:27.710\ndetection, IPS intrusion\nprevention solutions.\n\n123\n00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.970\nInstant in clarification, classification,\ncategorization, initial incidence support,\n\n124\n00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.330\nperhaps system recovery after an incident.\n\n125\n00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.760\nWe mentioned security awareness training,\nincident analysis, any and\n\n126\n00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.690\nall of these things or\nactivities that instant management\n\n127\n00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.760\nwould traditionally engage in and or\nfind themselves doing on a regular basis.\n\n128\n00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.510\nAnd when I talk to a lot of customers,\n\n129\n00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.900\nspeak to a lot of individuals\nabout incidence response or\n\n130\n00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:58.070\nengage in dialogs around how to do\nthese kinds of activities I often\n\n131\n00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.270\nfind an interesting distinction at least\nin many of the customers I deal with.\n\n132\n00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.310\nA lot of customers get the idea of\nincidence response they understand\n\n133\n00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.270\nwhy it's important.\n\n134\n00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.890\nThey understand the value of\nhaving trained professionals\n\n135\n00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:14.160\nthat know how to deal with computer\nsecurity related concerns,\n\n136\n00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:19.580\nwhether it's a breakout of a virus,\nwhether it is a hacking incident,\n\n137\n00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.560\nwhether it is espionage,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n138\n00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.210\nIt doesn't really matter,\nthey understand the value of that.\n\n139\n00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.040\nBut what they often don't\nreally differentiate around or\n\n140\n00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.430\namong is the roles that take\nplace within incident handling.\n\n141\n00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:34.865\nThey say well I need a trained\nteam of security professionals, or\n\n142\n00:07:34.865 --> 00:07:38.986\nI hear a lot these days, first responders,\njust as a general term, you know,\n\n143\n00:07:38.986 --> 00:07:42.118\nwhich is certainly appropriate,\nbut is not descriptive.\n\n144\n00:07:42.118 --> 00:07:46.643\nPer says, it's just a general tag we would\ngive to anybody in any role in theory.\n\n145\n00:07:46.643 --> 00:07:48.624\nAnd they show up and help to understand,\n\n146\n00:07:48.624 --> 00:07:52.490\nmake sense of what's going on as some of\nthe first people on the scene often do.\n\n147\n00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.765\nI so hear first responder used a lot.\n\n148\n00:07:55.765 --> 00:08:00.900\nBut what I don't hear is incident\nhandler and or incident manager.\n\n149\n00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:06.230\nI tend to hear IT does that,\nor I hear security does that.\n\n150\n00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:10.798\nI don't hear a differentiation or\nsee in the minds of my customers.\n\n151\n00:08:10.798 --> 00:08:14.646\nAnd perhaps even you see this out in the\nreal world as you're interacting with your\n\n152\n00:08:14.646 --> 00:08:17.770\norganization, with your colleagues,\nwith your peers.\n\n153\n00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.160\nYou may have first hand experience\nof what I'm describing.\n\n154\n00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:24.370\nI just don't hear in the minds of those\ncustomers and those students very often,\n\n155\n00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:30.550\nthe differentiation between security,\nIT, and incident handling, and response.\n\n156\n00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:34.390\nI see and hear that it kind of\nis lumped together into one,\n\n157\n00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:36.810\ngeneral descriptive bucket if you will,\nright?\n\n158\n00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:42.200\nAnd as a result while it certainly is,\nit's not confusing and it may or may not\n\n159\n00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:47.180\nbe appropriate to respond and to correct\nand say no, it's this, this or this.\n\n160\n00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.998\nReally depends on the culture\nof the organization.\n\n161\n00:08:48.998 --> 00:08:53.266\nBut what I'm pointing out to you is that\nthe language we use in our conversations\n\n162\n00:08:53.266 --> 00:08:54.390\nhere with you.\n\n163\n00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:57.493\nAnd as you're going through with this\nwith us maybe different than what you\n\n164\n00:08:57.493 --> 00:08:58.850\nhear in the real world.\n\n165\n00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:01.685\nAnd I want you to understand and\nbe aware of that, embrace that,\n\n166\n00:09:01.685 --> 00:09:03.272\nthere's nothing wrong with that.\n\n167\n00:09:03.272 --> 00:09:07.530\nThis is not a one size fits\nall kind of conversation.\n\n168\n00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:11.660\nIt can be a one size fits one\ncultural dissolution of this\n\n169\n00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:15.100\ninformation in to something that's\nrelevant for your organization.\n\n170\n00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.161\nBut what we have to understand and\n\n171\n00:09:17.161 --> 00:09:21.588\nknow about that is that regardless\nof the frame of reference we create.\n\n172\n00:09:21.588 --> 00:09:25.670\nIf we don't then do a good job of\ndefining what that standard is.\n\n173\n00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:29.975\nDefining that point of reference or\nthat context that we looked to create and\n\n174\n00:09:29.975 --> 00:09:34.147\nbroadly disseminate and communicate\nthat so everybody speaks about it,\n\n175\n00:09:34.147 --> 00:09:37.865\nunderstands it, thinks of it\nthe same way then we have a problem.\n\n176\n00:09:37.865 --> 00:09:40.820\nBecause we're speaking\nat odds to one another.\n\n177\n00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.852\nWe're speaking from\ndifferent perspectives.\n\n178\n00:09:42.852 --> 00:09:45.030\nAnd we're not referring\nto things the same way.\n\n179\n00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.893\nAnd as a result there's a lot\nof confusion typically.\n\n180\n00:09:47.893 --> 00:09:53.773\nWe need to call security for that, and or\nwe may need to call incidence response.\n\n181\n00:09:53.773 --> 00:09:57.478\nAnd if we're not taking the right steps\nand doing the right things at the right\n\n182\n00:09:57.478 --> 00:10:01.730\ntime in a timely fashion, we may actually\nget in the way of that response happening.\n\n183\n00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:05.580\nBecause we send people off on wild\ngoose chases to go get resources or\n\n184\n00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.970\nfind things or whatever that just\nare not referred to that way, right?\n\n185\n00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:13.020\nAnd I have that happen sometimes\nwhen I deal with customers\n\n186\n00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.070\nin various geographies around the world.\n\n187\n00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:21.060\nIf I'm not skilled and learned in\nthe local specificity of their language or\n\n188\n00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:25.980\ntheir specific contextual response or\nframe of reference for something.\n\n189\n00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.910\nThen I may call it something and\nit may be called something else, right?\n\n190\n00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.910\nA wrench is called a wrench\nhere in the United States.\n\n191\n00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:35.080\nIt's called spanner in certain parts\nof the world, for instance, right?\n\n192\n00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:39.140\nAnd a elevator,\nlike the one that we have behind us here.\n\n193\n00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.150\nWe should take a ride on that some day,\njust go up and\n\n194\n00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:42.650\ndown, and film while we're doing that.\n\n195\n00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:45.750\nAn elevator, here in the United States and\nin many other parts of the world,\n\n196\n00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:46.660\nit's called an elevator.\n\n197\n00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:49.260\nIt's also called the lift in\nmany parts of the world, right?\n\n198\n00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:53.070\nI won't go into what a bathroom, and water\ncloset, and loo may be referring to, but\n\n199\n00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:55.400\nyou get the general idea,\ndepending on where you come from, right?\n\n200\n00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:59.980\nMy point is, geography and\nculture has to play a very important part.\n\n201\n00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:03.430\nAs a subcontext to what we do everyday.\n\n202\n00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:07.980\nI work and interact with people all\nover the world at a regular basis.\n\n203\n00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.670\nIf I'm not sensitive to that\nas a security professional,\n\n204\n00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:14.150\nif I'm not going out of my way to\nunderstand how to create relevancy\n\n205\n00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:18.550\nin my conversations with them, in order\nto make them feel more comfortable.\n\n206\n00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:22.200\nAnd allow them to help me to help them,\nI'm not doing my job.\n\n207\n00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.810\nAnd I'm not doing it the right way.\n\n208\n00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:27.356\nAnd I'm actually contributing\nto the incident being\n\n209\n00:11:27.356 --> 00:11:32.254\nmore profound because I'm delaying\nresponse and delaying litigation.\n\n210\n00:11:32.254 --> 00:11:35.992\nAnd that's actually a complicated\nfactor that's in my direct control, and\n\n211\n00:11:35.992 --> 00:11:39.230\nthat I can compensate for\nif I'm smart and I pay attention.\n\n212\n00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:43.260\nBut you have to understand that to know\nthat, otherwise inadvertently, and again,\n\n213\n00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.020\nit's usually not on purpose.\n\n214\n00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:48.850\nBut inadvertently, you could actually get\nin the way of that response happening and\n\n215\n00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:50.140\nmake things worse.\n\n216\n00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:51.780\nSo, it's just something to consider.\n\n217\n00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:55.630\nWe don't often talk about some of\nthe subtle things as part of the general\n\n218\n00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:59.080\ntapestry of what we put together\nwith regards to incident response.\n\n219\n00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:03.370\nBut it is a really important subcontextual\nthought process that I want to at least\n\n220\n00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:06.094\nshare with you and and\nmake you aware of so to speak.\n\n221\n00:12:06.094 --> 00:12:10.885\n&gt;&gt; It is amazing how language can be\na great barrier to getting things done.\n\n222\n00:12:10.885 --> 00:12:14.172\nIf everyone is talking passed to each\nother, might not been able or be using\n\n223\n00:12:14.172 --> 00:12:18.180\nthe exact same terms but in a different\nway, with different meaning behind them.\n\n224\n00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.330\nAnd that can cause all kinds of confusion.\n\n225\n00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:20.940\nSo like Adam said,\n\n226\n00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:24.000\nit can become very important to make\nsure that everybody's on the same page\n\n227\n00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.708\nabout what you're talking about when\nit comes to resources, and procedures.\n\n228\n00:12:27.708 --> 00:12:31.690\nOtherwise, you got the whole, my favorite\nthing is the decapitated poultry syndrome.\n\n229\n00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.665\n&gt;&gt; Yes, chicken with your head cut off,\nabsolutely correct.\n\n230\n00:12:35.665 --> 00:12:36.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, thank you for\n\n231\n00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:40.290\nthat overly complex simplification\nof an answer, I appreciate that.\n\n232\n00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:41.614\nBut Daniel's absolutely right.\n\n233\n00:12:41.614 --> 00:12:45.570\nIt's a great summary of the point\nwe made which is as we both said.\n\n234\n00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:48.360\nAnd I think hopefully hearing it\nfrom more than one perspective\n\n235\n00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.740\nallows you to understand\nthe importance of it.\n\n236\n00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.810\nIt's rare that we take the time in\na serious way to take in a side and\n\n237\n00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:55.270\nboth speak about the same thing.\n\n238\n00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:56.530\nAnd really focus on it.\n\n239\n00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:58.880\nBut when we do it's obviously\nbecause it is important.\n\n240\n00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.980\nAnd it's something we feel\nyou need to understand.\n\n241\n00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.070\nAnd really be aware of this as well.\n\n242\n00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:03.110\nSo good job sir.\n\n243\n00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.920\nAppreciate that.\n\n244\n00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.573\nWait, wait, let's do it, right here.\n\n245\n00:13:05.573 --> 00:13:06.814\n&gt;&gt; There you-\n&gt;&gt; Look at that.\n\n246\n00:13:06.814 --> 00:13:07.318\nAwesome.\n\n247\n00:13:07.318 --> 00:13:08.263\n&gt;&gt; Take a picture.\n\n248\n00:13:08.263 --> 00:13:09.510\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n249\n00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:10.364\nThat's the money shot, right?\n\n250\n00:13:10.364 --> 00:13:11.038\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n251\n00:13:11.038 --> 00:13:13.570\n&gt;&gt; All right, so incident management\nprocess steps, what are they?\n\n252\n00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:17.110\nLet's talk quickly about\nthe mirror five that we focus on.\n\n253\n00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:21.260\nAs with any process, any linear\nprogression, any system that we outline\n\n254\n00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:25.470\nfor you that is going to be in order,\nthat should be in your mind.\n\n255\n00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:28.580\nSomething that triggers a response\nalong the lines of, let me go run and\n\n256\n00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:29.930\nget my flash cards.\n\n257\n00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:34.691\nLet me make a note, let me make sure that\nif I'm gonna pursue a certification around\n\n258\n00:13:34.691 --> 00:13:37.147\nthis knowledge, that I take note of this.\n\n259\n00:13:37.147 --> 00:13:40.227\nBecause chances are good that I may\nbe asked about it at some point in\n\n260\n00:13:40.227 --> 00:13:41.240\nthe future.\n\n261\n00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:44.345\nWe need to have like the little arrow that\ncomes up over my shoulder, ding, ding,\n\n262\n00:13:44.345 --> 00:13:46.325\nding, right,\nthe little exam light or something.\n\n263\n00:13:46.325 --> 00:13:48.724\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you were sufficiently warned.\n\n264\n00:13:48.724 --> 00:13:50.644\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You have been warned, exactly.\n\n265\n00:13:50.644 --> 00:13:52.406\nAlright so\nlet's talk about what these steps are.\n\n266\n00:13:52.406 --> 00:13:53.573\nVery important to know what they are.\n\n267\n00:13:53.573 --> 00:13:58.077\nPreparation, excuse me,\npreparation, protection, detection,\n\n268\n00:13:58.077 --> 00:13:59.690\ntriage, and response.\n\n269\n00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:06.110\nSo preparation, protection, detection,\ntriage, and response, PPDTR.\n\n270\n00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:09.110\nI can't come up with a good crazy\nacronym for that one like ARTTV or\n\n271\n00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:11.460\nany of the others that I've come up with,\nright?\n\n272\n00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:15.020\nSo preparation, right,\ngotta have all the tools necessary.\n\n273\n00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:18.910\nGotta have all of the things we need\norganized and ready to go, right?\n\n274\n00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:23.230\nPrior preparation makes for success,\nright, is what we often say.\n\n275\n00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:24.810\nPlan to be successful.\n\n276\n00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:26.730\nSo, get the toolkit together.\n\n277\n00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.500\nUnderstand who we have to\ncontact if we have a problem.\n\n278\n00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.760\nTalked about the value of\nunderstanding the of the business and\n\n279\n00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.480\nhow important it is to\nknow who to talk to.\n\n280\n00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.570\nThese are the kind of things\nthat will go into preparation.\n\n281\n00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:40.302\nProtection, make sure we have counter\nmeasures and controls in place that\n\n282\n00:14:40.302 --> 00:14:44.048\nare actively being used to mitigate and\nminimize known vulnerabilities.\n\n283\n00:14:44.048 --> 00:14:47.261\nAnd reiterate and check and\niterate through that on a regular\n\n284\n00:14:47.261 --> 00:14:51.890\nbasis to ensure we're still relevant and\naligned with business requirements.\n\n285\n00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:55.930\nNothing worse than protecting against\nsomebody's activities that are no longer\n\n286\n00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:58.530\nhappening and\nnot anticipating the ones that are.\n\n287\n00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.240\nAnd not being prepared to, obviously,\n\n288\n00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.190\ntake the steps necessary to\nprotect against those onslaughts.\n\n289\n00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:04.570\nThat's gonna be problematic.\n\n290\n00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:07.580\nSpeaking of onslaughts,\nreally cool movie you do have to see.\n\n291\n00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.150\nThose of you that have not seen it,\nit is good and\n\n292\n00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.210\nif you have seen it then\nyou know how good it is.\n\n293\n00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.700\nThe one with Matt Damon that came\nout recently, The Great Wall.\n\n294\n00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've seen that.\n\n295\n00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.260\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n&gt;&gt; Excellent film?\n\n296\n00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:20.158\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n297\n00:15:20.158 --> 00:15:20.837\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; If you're in to special\n\n298\n00:15:20.837 --> 00:15:21.534\neffects especially.\n\n299\n00:15:21.534 --> 00:15:24.204\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like Dungeons and Dragons\n\n300\n00:15:24.204 --> 00:15:29.149\nmeets like the Chinese Empire with like\njust gratuitous violence that's non stop.\n\n301\n00:15:29.149 --> 00:15:30.620\n&gt;&gt; You had me at gratuitous violence.\n\n302\n00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:31.996\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And if that wasn't enough,\n\n303\n00:15:31.996 --> 00:15:33.548\nCrouching Tiger Hidden Dragon?\n\n304\n00:15:33.548 --> 00:15:35.277\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So just things flying everywhere.\n\n305\n00:15:35.277 --> 00:15:37.150\n&gt;&gt; Those crazy fight scenes.\n\n306\n00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:38.860\n&gt;&gt; Crazy, ridiculous martial arts.\n\n307\n00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:40.900\nAll that-\n&gt;&gt; I've gotta go.\n\n308\n00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:42.141\nI'll back in a little a while.\n\n309\n00:15:42.141 --> 00:15:43.552\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If we hurry, we get on the road,\n\n310\n00:15:43.552 --> 00:15:44.934\nwith ten minutes we could be there.\n\n311\n00:15:44.934 --> 00:15:46.661\n&gt;&gt; Let's do it. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Right?\nSo, awesome movie.\n\n312\n00:15:46.661 --> 00:15:47.991\nDefinitely wanna check that out right.\n\n313\n00:15:47.991 --> 00:15:48.932\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n314\n00:15:48.932 --> 00:15:51.300\nI forgot to mention that last time\nwhen we're talking about movies.\n\n315\n00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.187\nAnyway, back to what\nwe were talking about.\n\n316\n00:15:53.187 --> 00:15:54.527\n[LAUGH] So\nwe're talking about preparation,\n\n317\n00:15:54.527 --> 00:15:55.592\nwe're talking about protection.\n\n318\n00:15:55.592 --> 00:15:57.278\nWhat about detection,\nright, what goes on there?\n\n319\n00:15:57.278 --> 00:16:02.486\nWell all the preparation in the world, all\nthe current protection we have, is good.\n\n320\n00:16:02.486 --> 00:16:04.954\nBut if we're not paying attention\nto what's happening and\n\n321\n00:16:04.954 --> 00:16:07.571\nconstantly monitoring, and\nlooking at what's happening and\n\n322\n00:16:07.571 --> 00:16:10.384\nunderstanding that when things\nhappen that we're not prepared for\n\n323\n00:16:10.384 --> 00:16:13.470\nthat we get alerted to them, then\nwe're going to get caught by surprise.\n\n324\n00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:15.837\nSomebody's going to creep up behind us,\nright, and\n\n325\n00:16:15.837 --> 00:16:19.370\njust steal that chair right out from\nunder us when we're not paying attention.\n\n326\n00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:21.747\nThat's a pretty apropos\nreference right there.\n\n327\n00:16:21.747 --> 00:16:23.027\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you think about that, right.\n\n328\n00:16:23.027 --> 00:16:24.452\nSo making sure [LAUGH],\n\n329\n00:16:24.452 --> 00:16:29.280\nmaking sure that we understand what's\ncontinuously going on around us.\n\n330\n00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:33.060\nWe commonly call it continuous monitoring\nin the business, as you would say.\n\n331\n00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:36.795\nLook at what's happening and have\nan ability to be able to report on that.\n\n332\n00:16:36.795 --> 00:16:41.322\nTriage, when something does happen,\nwhen the bad things aren't detected and\n\n333\n00:16:41.322 --> 00:16:43.030\nwe're not prepared to deal with them and\n\n334\n00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:46.080\nthe incident occurs,\nlet's figure out how bad it is.\n\n335\n00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.890\nLet's do some quick\nassessment in the field,\n\n336\n00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:51.590\nprioritize the things that\nare really problematic.\n\n337\n00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:54.930\nPush off to the side and\ngive them a lower priority\n\n338\n00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.600\nsome of the things that are not\nas problematic and can wait.\n\n339\n00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.200\nAnd let's make sure we put resources\nto bear and put them into play\n\n340\n00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.590\nat the point of inflection where\nthey're gonna have the most good\n\n341\n00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:08.220\navailable to us in terms of the value\nwe're gonna create by mitigating.\n\n342\n00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:10.730\nAnd let's minimize the damage\nas quickly as possible.\n\n343\n00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:14.520\nAnd response is then driven by triage,\nresponse is okay.\n\n344\n00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:17.290\nWe've got a prioritize dealing with x,\ny and z.\n\n345\n00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:19.070\nLet's go get those things done, and\n\n346\n00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:22.440\npush off to the side some of the other\nstuff that may or may not be important.\n\n347\n00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.570\nSo we wanna make sure we understand\nthe incident management process steps.\n\n348\n00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:29.490\nThe incident management team has to drive\nthis process and I have all the tools,\n\n349\n00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:33.980\ncapabilities, resources necessary in order\nto execute on all of these activities.\n\n350\n00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:36.390\nVery, very important for\nus to understand that.\n\n351\n00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:40.350\nThe incident management team should be,\nas we talked about,\n\n352\n00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:44.370\nmade up of individuals that are going\nto be specialists in these areas.\n\n353\n00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:48.220\nSorry for talking down at you there for\na minute, looking down at my machine.\n\n354\n00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:52.240\nI hit the wrong button and all of\na sudden my note that I was about to\n\n355\n00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:55.290\ntalk about with you went from being in\nfront of me to being at the bottom and\n\n356\n00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:56.430\nI was at the top of the page.\n\n357\n00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:58.910\nThat's what happens when\nyou're not paying attention.\n\n358\n00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:01.220\nSo incident management teams are,\nas we said,\n\n359\n00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:04.960\ngroups of people that are brought\ntogether that have special knowledge,\n\n360\n00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.310\nspecial activities, special capabilities\nthat they're going to bring to the table.\n\n361\n00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:10.050\nYou need the database specialists.\n\n362\n00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:11.720\nYou need the firewall specialists.\n\n363\n00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:15.410\nYou need the person who understands\nhow to deal with code and\n\n364\n00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:18.122\nunderstand and look at code\nfrom a developer's perspective.\n\n365\n00:18:18.122 --> 00:18:21.370\nYou need the person who specializes\nin networking and routing.\n\n366\n00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:25.420\nAll these people have to part of the\nincident response team cuz we wanna make\n\n367\n00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:29.840\nsure that this group of professionals are\ngonna be able to speak knowledgeably and\n\n368\n00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.490\nsupport each other around the activities\nnecessary to mitigate and\n\n369\n00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:34.970\nminimize the damage.\n\n370\n00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:38.650\nCompose it of people from different skills\nsets in different areas of the business.\n\n371\n00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:42.100\nHave on demand the ability to\noutsource those skills if needed,\n\n372\n00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.935\nto call them in from the outside.\n\n373\n00:18:43.935 --> 00:18:49.390\nI mentioned several times that I often\nplay the role, or at least am asked\n\n374\n00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:54.510\nto play a contributory part, as a member\nof a team from the outside perspective.\n\n375\n00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:58.180\nI'm not, in other words, working for many\nof the companies I do business with and\n\n376\n00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:01.510\nwork for on a regular basis,\nas a full-time employee.\n\n377\n00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:04.320\nI'm typically just a hired\nexpert that gets called in in\n\n378\n00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:09.330\norder to provide guidance or\nprovide support in a certain area or\n\n379\n00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:11.690\nis asked advice of, things like that.\n\n380\n00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:14.930\nI get emails and phone calls from\ncustomers and clients all the time, and\n\n381\n00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:18.040\nstudents all the time, saying, hey,\ncan you help us to understand this?\n\n382\n00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:21.590\nCan you explain this, can you\nrecommend somebody who can do this?\n\n383\n00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:22.695\nI always say Daniel.\n\n384\n00:19:22.695 --> 00:19:23.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I always send Daniel, no matter what.\n\n385\n00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:24.410\n&gt;&gt; He just calls me.\n\n386\n00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:26.370\n&gt;&gt; Regardless of what it is,\nyou need your car fixed,\n\n387\n00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:29.600\nyou need a firewall tuned, you need\na knife sharpened, Daniel's the guy.\n\n388\n00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:30.610\n&gt;&gt; I can do that [LAUGH].\n\n389\n00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:32.040\n&gt;&gt; I just keep sending them Daniel.\n\n390\n00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:35.690\nEventually, I figure, they'll either\nstop asking or they'll hire Daniel.\n\n391\n00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:38.210\nEither way, it works out.\n\n392\n00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:40.730\n&gt;&gt; Well I tell them, I say if you\nneed to contact me, just call Adam.\n\n393\n00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:42.390\n&gt;&gt; And then he'll tell you how to contact,\nworks out well.\n\n394\n00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:43.640\n&gt;&gt; The circle is viciously\nperpetuated [LAUGH].\n\n395\n00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.800\n&gt;&gt; The circle of misinformation,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n396\n00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.561\n&gt;&gt; Continues to be propagated around,\n\n397\n00:19:47.561 --> 00:19:48.532\naround and around.\n\n398\n00:19:48.532 --> 00:19:52.954\nSo incident response teams need to be,\nobviously, focused on the ability to deal\n\n399\n00:19:52.954 --> 00:19:56.237\nwith the basic blocking and\ntackling of incident response.\n\n400\n00:19:56.237 --> 00:19:58.512\nBut also when they need\nto bring in specialists,\n\n401\n00:19:58.512 --> 00:20:01.453\nthey have to either have those\nskills available or, as I said,\n\n402\n00:20:01.453 --> 00:20:04.320\ndon't be afraid to go out and\nfind them in the field, right.\n\n403\n00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.440\nYou may go out and say, hey,\nI need somebody who understands Python,\n\n404\n00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.700\nand we just don't have a Python developer.\n\n405\n00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:14.400\nLet's see who we can find, and maybe\nwe pay somebody to bring somebody in.\n\n406\n00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.658\nBurt the point is you gotta\nknow that's what you need.\n\n407\n00:20:16.658 --> 00:20:19.510\nSo you gotta think about the ability\nto be able to develop and\n\n408\n00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:23.520\nexamine processes inside the business,\nand assess whether they are valid or not.\n\n409\n00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:28.374\nConstantly looking for ways to improve and\nupdate our incident management, and,\n\n410\n00:20:28.374 --> 00:20:33.312\nas a result, our proactive stance against\nthe nature of the threat that we may face.\n\n411\n00:20:33.312 --> 00:20:36.766\nManage a response to all\nthe incidents that may be occurring.\n\n412\n00:20:36.766 --> 00:20:39.610\nThis is part of what the incident\nresponse team may need to do.\n\n413\n00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:44.260\nExamine any changes in legal and\nregulatory frameworks that may impact\n\n414\n00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:47.929\nour ability to do our job, and have a\nsense of those, understand what they are.\n\n415\n00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:52.600\nReview and recommend technologies\nthat may exist out in the wild\n\n416\n00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:56.520\nthat could be a value brought in to the\nbusiness, and may augment and update our\n\n417\n00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:00.580\nability to be able to respond and\nreply to threats and deal with incidents.\n\n418\n00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:02.360\nThis is an important part of what we do.\n\n419\n00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:07.520\nEstablish relationships with vendors,\nlocal law enforcement, any agencies\n\n420\n00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:11.750\nthat may be helpful and beneficial, or\nvendors that may be helpful or beneficial.\n\n421\n00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:15.290\nAnd people often leave out and forget\nabout things like local user groups.\n\n422\n00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:17.470\nYou and I were talking about VMUG,\nI think, yesterday,\n\n423\n00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:18.398\nright off camera a little bit.\n\n424\n00:21:18.398 --> 00:21:21.140\nSo VMUG, right, without necessarily\n\n425\n00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:24.030\ngoing into the details of whatever\nuser group in the world may be.\n\n426\n00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:25.188\nBut there's many of them.\n\n427\n00:21:25.188 --> 00:21:29.570\nThere's Oracle RAC user groups, there's\njust a whole bunch of different ones.\n\n428\n00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:33.760\nWhatever it may be, if you need to be\ninvolved with that particular area of\n\n429\n00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:37.680\nspecialty, or you have a need in your\nbusiness because of that technology,\n\n430\n00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.170\nyou should find if there is\na local user group or not.\n\n431\n00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:44.680\nThere may be an Inferguard chapter\nin your area, associate with them.\n\n432\n00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.380\nThere's all these different ways, right.\n\n433\n00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:50.990\nMany of the certification groups like\nISACA And ISC squared have chapters or\n\n434\n00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:54.240\nlocal area groups that\nyou can affiliate with.\n\n435\n00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:57.430\nAnd these are great places,\nnot only to network and\n\n436\n00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:59.500\nmeet other professionals\nthat do what you do, but\n\n437\n00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:02.830\nto find out about things that\nare going on, trends in the industry.\n\n438\n00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:04.830\nThey often put on meetings.\n\n439\n00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:07.580\nThey often bring in speakers,\nthings like that.\n\n440\n00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:09.850\nThey sponsor workshops,\nall sorts of stuff.\n\n441\n00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:13.570\nAnd it's just such a valuable resource for\nus, as security professionals,\n\n442\n00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:14.430\nto be involved with.\n\n443\n00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:15.930\nSo you wanna think about that.\n\n444\n00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:19.810\nAlso making sure that you're\ndoing your due diligence.\n\n445\n00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:21.771\nKeep your ear to the ground,\nplay with new technology,\n\n446\n00:22:21.771 --> 00:22:23.076\nfind out what's going on out there.\n\n447\n00:22:23.076 --> 00:22:26.166\nIf somebody says, hey,\nhave you heard about x, y, z, and\n\n448\n00:22:26.166 --> 00:22:30.079\nyou don't know what that is, go out and\nread up on it a little bit, figure it out.\n\n449\n00:22:30.079 --> 00:22:34.183\nUnderstand whether or not that's impactful\nto you, your industry, your vertical, and\n\n450\n00:22:34.183 --> 00:22:34.940\nyour business.\n\n451\n00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:36.283\nAnd if it is, what do you doing about it?\n\n452\n00:22:36.283 --> 00:22:38.192\nAnd if it's not, okay, no big deal,\n\n453\n00:22:38.192 --> 00:22:40.970\nbut at least you're aware of\nit if it comes up, right.\n\n454\n00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:44.200\nThere isn't a day that goes by that I\ndon't find out about some sort of new\n\n455\n00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:48.060\ntrend or technology or\nissue or concern that affects\n\n456\n00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:51.920\none of my customers somewhere because of\nall the different verticals I work in.\n\n457\n00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:55.740\nBut there's so much out there going on\ntoday, just so many crazy things, right.\n\n458\n00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:58.960\nI mean, it's a great time, I guess,\nif you think about it, right,\n\n459\n00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:02.020\nto be doing what we're doing just\nbecause of the advents in technolog.\n\n460\n00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:03.570\nBut it's also incredibly challenging.\n\n461\n00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:07.070\nIf you think about the fact there's so\nmuch that we've got to master and\n\n462\n00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:09.520\nunderstand, it's really hard to keep up.\n\n463\n00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:13.195\nI had this conversation with my kids\nrecently, my older daughter recently.\n\n464\n00:23:13.195 --> 00:23:17.910\nBecause we were talking a little bit about\ntechnology and just all the stuff her and\n\n465\n00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:21.650\nher friends do, how they keep in touch and\nthings like that.\n\n466\n00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:23.511\nAnd I was just remarking on the fact,\n\n467\n00:23:23.511 --> 00:23:26.745\nwhen I was a kid her age growing up,\nwe didn't have all these things.\n\n468\n00:23:26.745 --> 00:23:29.750\nIf you wanted to talk to your friend,\nyou got out of the house, you went and\n\n469\n00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:32.520\nfound them, and\nyou actually talked to them face to face.\n\n470\n00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:36.239\nShe sits in a room as all teenagers do,\nnever gets out of her bed, and\n\n471\n00:23:36.239 --> 00:23:38.148\nis in touch with the entire world.\n\n472\n00:23:38.148 --> 00:23:41.995\nShe's got her little command center,\nher computer, her laptop,\n\n473\n00:23:41.995 --> 00:23:43.424\nher tablet, her phone.\n\n474\n00:23:43.424 --> 00:23:44.727\nI mean, other than having to eat and\n\n475\n00:23:44.727 --> 00:23:45.676\ngo to the bathroom,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n476\n00:23:45.676 --> 00:23:46.371\n&gt;&gt; She would never,\n\n477\n00:23:46.371 --> 00:23:48.230\never have to leave the room Literally,\nright?\n\n478\n00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:50.747\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna be that ship\non WALL-E before too long.\n\n479\n00:23:50.747 --> 00:23:52.410\nEverybody's just floating around [LAUGH].\n\n480\n00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:57.020\n&gt;&gt; It's kinda crazy, but if you think\nabout it, that's kinda where we are.\n\n481\n00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:00.530\nI mean, people in my generation,\ndepending on how old you are,\n\n482\n00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:03.190\nperhaps younger than me,\nperhaps older than me.\n\n483\n00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:06.590\nBut people of a certain age\ngroup in a certain generation,\n\n484\n00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:07.780\nwe appreciate technology.\n\n485\n00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:09.420\nDon't get me wrong,\nit's what I do for a living.\n\n486\n00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:11.010\nBut I tell people all the time.\n\n487\n00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:13.514\nI know those anti-technology\ntechnologist you wanna meet.\n\n488\n00:24:13.514 --> 00:24:15.680\nYou and I talked about this a lot\n&gt;&gt; Same way [LAUGH].\n\n489\n00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:16.720\n&gt;&gt; When i go home.\n\n490\n00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.700\nForget this stuff.\n\n491\n00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:19.390\nIt does not exist.\n\n492\n00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:21.670\nI actually read books the old fashion way.\n\n493\n00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:25.500\nI take them off the shelf, I blow\nthe dust off and I hold them in my hand.\n\n494\n00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.790\nWhen I wanna get a book,\nI actually either although,\n\n495\n00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:31.280\nthey don't exist much anymore go to\nthese mythical places called bookstores\n\n496\n00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.860\nwhere you used to find mythical\nthings called books on shelves.\n\n497\n00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:38.100\nOr even more mythical, I'm gonna go\nold school on you, I go to libraries.\n\n498\n00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:39.822\nOoh.\nNow that's one you don't hear often about.\n\n499\n00:24:39.822 --> 00:24:44.310\nBut, I for what I do,\nyou look at what I do for a living, and\n\n500\n00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:47.770\nI have this conversation with my wife\nall the time, I get home at night and\n\n501\n00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:49.880\nyou need to do this, this, and\nthis for the girls on the computer.\n\n502\n00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.880\nI'm like you don't understand,\nI'm done working.\n\n503\n00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.240\nThe word computer doesn't\nexist when I leave work.\n\n504\n00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.320\nIf you want it done,\nyou go on the computer and figure it out.\n\n505\n00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:59.140\n&gt;&gt; I'm not the house's tech support.\n\n506\n00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:00.960\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm my families tech support,\n\n507\n00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:01.910\nand you're probably the same way.\n\n508\n00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:02.830\nI get that.\n\n509\n00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:06.810\nSomething breaks, my sister-in-law needs\na computer fixed, I get a phone call.\n\n510\n00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:10.410\nMy nephews or my niece need something\ninstalled I get the phone call.\n\n511\n00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:12.760\nUncle Adam,\ncan you give us Office or whatever.\n\n512\n00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:16.210\nI don't have a problem with all that,\nI'm happy to do that for them.\n\n513\n00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:19.311\nBut I don't want to play with\ntechnology when I leave work.\n\n514\n00:25:19.311 --> 00:25:21.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; The last thing I wanna\n\n515\n00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.118\nsee is a computer.\n\n516\n00:25:22.118 --> 00:25:25.960\nSo when you deal with this kind of\nstuff and you have to keep up with it.\n\n517\n00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:31.180\nI spend a significant amount of my time\noutside of work doing work related\n\n518\n00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:35.260\nstuff because I've just gotta read up on\nwhat's going on and keep track and stuff.\n\n519\n00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:36.740\nI mean, I read periodicals.\n\n520\n00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:39.770\nI mean, stuff you would just\nthink is absolutely insane like\n\n521\n00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:43.960\nEnvironmental Control Monthly and\nBuilding Automation.\n\n522\n00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:47.300\nBecause this is the kind of\nstuff because of the work we do.\n\n523\n00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:50.100\nI've got to understand\nthe impact in Scata, ICS and\n\n524\n00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:53.570\ncyber physical systems from a security\nstandpoint with all of this stuff.\n\n525\n00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:56.110\nI gotta read these crazy publications that\n\n526\n00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:58.380\npeople that install air conditioners for\nliving read.\n\n527\n00:25:58.380 --> 00:25:59.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n528\n00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:01.550\n&gt;&gt; Not because they're not interesting but\nbecause it bears\n\n529\n00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:05.890\ndirectly on what a lot of my clients have\nconcerns with that I have to speak to.\n\n530\n00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:08.060\nHey, our building is managed and\nautomated.\n\n531\n00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:09.870\nWe don't have a clue what that means.\n\n532\n00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:11.240\nAre there liabilities there.\n\n533\n00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:14.160\nFrom and incident handling perspective,\nyou better believe there are.\n\n534\n00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.270\nCan you speak to them knowledgeably.\n\n535\n00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:16.830\nI don't know.\n\n536\n00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:19.340\nIf you can't, I'm not suggesting\nyou're not good at your job.\n\n537\n00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:21.040\nI'm just pointing out\nthat if you can't and\n\n538\n00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.950\nyour customer or\nyour business needs you to, you\n\n539\n00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:27.940\nbetter start figuring out how to know more\nabout that, cuz that's part of your job.\n\n540\n00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:29.100\nIt's part of what we do.\n\n541\n00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:34.520\nWhen the hackers come in through\nthe interface of that HVAC system and\n\n542\n00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:38.390\nlearn how to jump from there into the rest\nof the building and you don't figure that\n\n543\n00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:41.190\nout, they're gonna be in and\nout before you know what happened.\n\n544\n00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:42.330\nThat's just the reality.\n\n545\n00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:44.690\nIf you don't believe me, just go watch\nany of the newest movies that are out.\n\n546\n00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:46.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You'll see that happening all the time.\n\n547\n00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:51.340\nTo sum all the other thing, this is\na wrap up quickly as we finish up here.\n\n548\n00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:52.874\nThe members of the instant response teams,\n\n549\n00:26:52.874 --> 00:26:55.280\nwho's typically on\nan instant response team.\n\n550\n00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:59.410\nWe talk about all the different skills\nthat are there but what about some of\n\n551\n00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:04.750\nthe roles, things like the information\nsecurity function, so the CISO, the CSO\n\n552\n00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:10.350\nrole in a business Chief Information\nSecurity Officer, Chief Security Officer.\n\n553\n00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:16.710\nWhat about the Technology Officer,\nCTO, Chief Technology Officer, CIO,\n\n554\n00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:18.170\nChief Information Officer.\n\n555\n00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:20.880\nA lot of my customers\nthese days have CROs,\n\n556\n00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:26.550\nChief Risk Officers, a fairly common\nthought process we hear about today.\n\n557\n00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:30.700\nIA, Information Assurant, so the\ngovernment and military sector, very big.\n\n558\n00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:34.210\nI have a lot of customers that\nhave information privacy officers.\n\n559\n00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:38.140\nSo, IPOs, or CPOs,\nchief privacy officers, things like that.\n\n560\n00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:40.740\nThey vary again,\nby region or by geography.\n\n561\n00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:45.050\nNetwork and system administrators,\ninternal auditing functions,\n\n562\n00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:48.980\nthese are the kind of roles you wanna\nsee and have represented on these teams.\n\n563\n00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:51.320\nWhat about incident\nresponse team structure?\n\n564\n00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:54.880\nI've talked a bit about this before,\ncentralized versus decentralized.\n\n565\n00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:58.140\nYou know we may have an all up\nall in one centrally managed and\n\n566\n00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:02.090\ncontrolled function that is in\nheadquarters, where ever that would be,\n\n567\n00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:04.230\nand deploys into the field as needed.\n\n568\n00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:08.610\nWe may have a decentralized function that\nmay exist in several regional areas and\n\n569\n00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:11.130\nis either virtual, or physical,\nor a hybrid of the two.\n\n570\n00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:13.730\nYou also have what's called\na coordination team role.\n\n571\n00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:17.340\nA role that essentially just provides\nadvice and guidance and support to other\n\n572\n00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:22.208\nteams, but does not respond necessarily\nin and of themselves to incidents.\n\n573\n00:28:22.208 --> 00:28:24.630\nSo just wanna think about that and\n\n574\n00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:27.180\nbe aware of that,\ncuz that's something else to consider.\n\n575\n00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:30.820\nAnd also, we talked a lot about\nincident response, incident handling,\n\n576\n00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:31.560\nincident management.\n\n577\n00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:34.380\nKind of this trifecta\nthat we put together.\n\n578\n00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:35.450\nI should probably do this right.\n\n579\n00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:37.460\nThe Trifecta, if that's a triangle.\n\n580\n00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:38.910\nI could try to do this thing again, but\n\n581\n00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:40.660\nwe're not gonna have\nthat whole conversation.\n\n582\n00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:44.110\nSo the trifecta thing,\nwhere we have incident handling.\n\n583\n00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:48.230\nIncident response and incident management\nor any combination if you do this.\n\n584\n00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:50.520\nBut what's their relationship there.\n\n585\n00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:51.930\nI use a triangle just to represent it,\n\n586\n00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:54.460\nbut what is the relationship\nbetween these three?\n\n587\n00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:56.200\nThis is important to think about as well.\n\n588\n00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:00.460\nIncident response, ultimately,\nis a function that gets carried out by and\n\n589\n00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:01.900\nthrough incident handling and\n\n590\n00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:06.810\nis coordinated as a service from\nthe perspective of incident management.\n\n591\n00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:09.120\nAnd so\nwe wanna understand how to coordinate and\n\n592\n00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:12.080\nreally understand the relationship\nbetween these three.\n\n593\n00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:16.250\nBecause understanding how these interact\nwith each other helps us to be better at\n\n594\n00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:19.180\nwhat we're doing with regards to\nincident handling and response.\n\n595\n00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:20.700\nVery, very important to think about that.\n\n596\n00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:24.997\n&gt;&gt; Adam, incident response is another one\nof those very large topics that we have to\n\n597\n00:29:24.997 --> 00:29:29.249\napproach and approach here when it comes\nto it being an incident handler per se.\n\n598\n00:29:29.249 --> 00:29:33.225\nA lot of information here is probably\ngonna be something you wanna go through\n\n599\n00:29:33.225 --> 00:29:34.353\nover and over again.\n\n600\n00:29:34.353 --> 00:29:38.196\nGet a lot of those definitions, concepts,\nburied deeply into the brain so\n\n601\n00:29:38.196 --> 00:29:41.185\nthat when you do some exam or\nyou get out to the real world and\n\n602\n00:29:41.185 --> 00:29:45.343\nstart practically working in this field\nyou have a great understanding of that.\n\n603\n00:29:45.343 --> 00:29:48.078\nAnd Adam, you did a great\njob guiding us through that.\n\n604\n00:29:48.078 --> 00:29:49.040\nWe appreciate that.\n\n605\n00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:53.050\nThat being said, we're looking at\nthe clock and by gone it is time for\n\n606\n00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:56.080\nus to call another day, we do appreciate\nyou guys for joining us though,\n\n607\n00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:57.730\nfor signing off for ITPro TV,\n\n608\n00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:00.850\nI've been your host Daniel Larry,\n&gt;&gt; I'm HVAC\n\n609\n00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:02.435\nsupport professional number two.\n\n610\n00:30:02.435 -->

of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.000\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode we continue on with more\n\n7\n00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.920\non our EIC or ECIH, gonna say\nthat backwards it's gonna be fun.\n\n8\n00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.870\nIt's completely different acronym.\n\n9\n00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.950\nAnd joining us back in\nthe studio of course,\n\n10\n00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.670\nour mentor, our pedagogue,\nas it were, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.010\nAdam, welcome back sir, how goes it?\n\n12\n00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.730\n&gt;&gt; Pedagogue, you are just breaking out\nthat SAT vocabulary, are you not, sir?\n\n13\n00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.450\n&gt;&gt; I have a good English vocabulary.\n\n14\n00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.880\n&gt;&gt; I guess, I'm impressed!\n\n15\n00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.835\nSo it is going well, it is going well.\n\n16\n00:00:42.835 --> 00:00:44.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hope it is going well for all of you.\n\n17\n00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.780\nWe are going to continue\nour conversations here\n\n18\n00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.230\n&gt;&gt; Under the banner of ECIH.\n\n19\n00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.640\nRegardless of what Daniel thinks,\nwe may be here to talk about.\n\n20\n00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.592\n&gt;&gt; You do what I tell you.\n\n21\n00:00:53.592 --> 00:00:55.090\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, no problem.\n\n22\n00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.820\nSo we're gonna talk about CSIRTs,\n\n23\n00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.430\nspecifically computer security\nincident response teams.\n\n24\n00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.440\nWhat are they?\n\n25\n00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.430\nWhy do we need one?\n\n26\n00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.850\nAnd why should you care?\n\n27\n00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.050\nI don't have good answers for any of those\nso we should just call this done and\n\n28\n00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.650\ndo something else.\n\n29\n00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.230\nWhat do you think?\n\n30\n00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.550\n&gt;&gt; Well, thanks for watching, everyone.\n\n31\n00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.410\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it was a good episode.\n\n32\n00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.090\nHigh five!\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n33\n00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.160\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, all right!\n\n34\n00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.860\nSee you next time.\n\n35\n00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.480\n&gt;&gt; Now let's actually\nget down to business.\n\n36\n00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.820\nI'm just joking around with you here.\n\n37\n00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.390\nSo we are gonna talk about SEI CERTS.\n\n38\n00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.420\nThe idea behind a SEI CERT with\nregards to incident response.\n\n39\n00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.340\nSo interesting when we think about\nthe fact that we've talked about\n\n40\n00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.990\nincident response teams.\n\n41\n00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.750\nWe've talked about incident handling,\nincident management and the whole idea\n\n42\n00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.010\nof how we are gonna bring together\n&gt;&gt; Those resources, those individuals and\n\n43\n00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.910\nthe knowledge they have allow them\nto be coordinated in such a way\n\n44\n00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.518\nthat we can hopefully respond to any\nincident, identify it, minimize it.\n\n45\n00:01:45.518 --> 00:01:48.055\nAnd obviously then deal\nwith the outcome of it and\n\n46\n00:01:48.055 --> 00:01:50.685\ntry to get back to normal as easily and\nas quickly as possible.\n\n47\n00:01:50.685 --> 00:01:52.465\nWe've been through that\nwhole methodology with you.\n\n48\n00:01:52.465 --> 00:01:53.205\nEncourage you to go back,\n\n49\n00:01:53.205 --> 00:01:56.285\ntake a look at those episodes if you\nhaven't had the chance to do so.\n\n50\n00:01:56.285 --> 00:01:59.905\nUnder the heading of incidence\nresponse steps and what we do there.\n\n51\n00:01:59.905 --> 00:02:01.435\nBut with regards to C-certs,\n\n52\n00:02:01.435 --> 00:02:03.725\nwe're broadening our\nconversation just a little bit.\n\n53\n00:02:03.725 --> 00:02:06.355\nThe idea of computer security\nincidence response teams\n\n54\n00:02:06.355 --> 00:02:08.685\nis certainly incidence response,\nno doubt about it.\n\n55\n00:02:08.685 --> 00:02:11.380\nBut incidence response\nfocused at the nexus,\n\n56\n00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.790\nat the inflection point\nof computer security.\n\n57\n00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.700\nWhat are we doing there?\n\n58\n00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.300\nTeams of trained professionals, right,\nthat are gonna be responsible for\n\n59\n00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.330\ndealing with incidents\nspecific to computer security.\n\n60\n00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.380\nSo, if we have a Incident where\nsomebody is able to physically\n\n61\n00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.480\nbreach the facility we're in by faking\ntheir way through a checkpoint with either\n\n62\n00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.650\na stolen ID or a stolen social engineering\nploy, or whatever the case may be.\n\n63\n00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.430\nThat's an incident.\n\n64\n00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.870\nIt is a security incident, but\n\n65\n00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.640\nit probably has nothing to do with\ncomputers quite honestly, right.\n\n66\n00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.410\nBut if somebody puts malware onto\nour system, or somehow hacks into\n\n67\n00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.020\na database and gains access to corporate\nfiles, customer records, who knows what.\n\n68\n00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.860\nThat's a computer security incident,\nright?\n\n69\n00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.080\nSo we have to differentiate, and\n\n70\n00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.330\nthink about the fact that there\nare different kinds of incidents.\n\n71\n00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.900\nAnd hopefully not a surprise, we may need\ndifferent kinds of incident responders,\n\n72\n00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.670\nand incident response teams, instead of\nresponse teams to address those incidents,\n\n73\n00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.520\nas we consider their impact, and\nwhat else may come from that.\n\n74\n00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.530\nPrimary function, primary job\nrole of the C cert is to review,\n\n75\n00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.680\nultimately receive and\nrespond to incidents and\n\n76\n00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.440\nunderstand how to deal with them from\nthe computer security perspective.\n\n77\n00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.336\nSo when we think about\nthe role of the C-cert,\n\n78\n00:03:25.336 --> 00:03:28.394\nwe're really thinking\nabout a sub speciality.\n\n79\n00:03:28.394 --> 00:03:31.630\nAn area focused exclusively\non computers security.\n\n80\n00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.600\nComputer security related activities and\nconcerns.\n\n81\n00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.872\nAnd this is again although it's perhaps so\nspecial if a broad one.\n\n82\n00:03:37.872 --> 00:03:40.390\nI mean think about what\ncomputers are involved today.\n\n83\n00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.700\nIt's very hard to think about\njarminal stamining as we discussed\n\n84\n00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.980\nwith regards to computers if you don't\ninvolve your computer in some way.\n\n85\n00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.940\nAnd so when we think about this and\nthink about what's going on.\n\n86\n00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.270\nIt may actually be something that is\nvery broad reaching in the organization.\n\n87\n00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.780\nA C cert may actually involve\nalmost any aspect of incident\n\n88\n00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.850\nresponse in an organization today.\n\n89\n00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.575\nBecause most of the systems that\nwe deal with are computer related.\n\n90\n00:04:04.575 --> 00:04:05.905\nAnd so we have to think about that.\n\n91\n00:04:05.905 --> 00:04:10.475\nI mentioned in my example a moment ago,\nperhaps some sort of access control\n\n92\n00:04:10.475 --> 00:04:14.857\ninteraction with a bad actor, and\nyou being able to get through a system.\n\n93\n00:04:14.857 --> 00:04:19.100\nThough ven then, you're probably\nchecking IDs in through a computer.\n\n94\n00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.100\nRight, so maybe a card swiped,\nor maybe a card scanned.\n\n95\n00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.240\nThere's a computer on\nthe other end of that system.\n\n96\n00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.240\nAnd so, we may actually see that as being\na computer security related incident.\n\n97\n00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.360\nUnless it is a guard asking you,\ninteracting with you verbally, essentially\n\n98\n00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.460\ninterviewing you and asking you questions\nbefore they let you through a checkpoint.\n\n99\n00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.130\nAnd they're essentially getting up and\nopening they gate, right, and\n\n100\n00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.690\nallowing you in.\n\n101\n00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.520\nAnd it's all manual, then there's\nprobably computers somewhere involved.\n\n102\n00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.510\nWe could make the case and\n\n103\n00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.700\ntheory that that may be a computer\nsecurity related incident.\n\n104\n00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.370\nSo, keep that in mind and\nunderstand that today, very broadly,\n\n105\n00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.125\nalmost everything we do may fall\nunder the guise of C certs.\n\n106\n00:04:55.125 --> 00:04:57.865\nEven though we may or\nmay not actually differentiate that way.\n\n107\n00:04:57.865 --> 00:05:01.165\nWhat are the goals of the C Cert,\nthe things that we set out to accomplish,\n\n108\n00:05:01.165 --> 00:05:02.205\nthings we wanna do.\n\n109\n00:05:02.205 --> 00:05:04.585\nManage problems associated\nwith the incident,\n\n110\n00:05:04.585 --> 00:05:06.005\nvery important to think about that.\n\n111\n00:05:06.005 --> 00:05:07.365\nReduce and control damage and\n\n112\n00:05:07.365 --> 00:05:10.915\npotential negative consequences\nas a result of the incident.\n\n113\n00:05:10.915 --> 00:05:13.970\nAnd also provide effective response and\nrecovery.\n\n114\n00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.770\nSo we want to be able to minimize\nthe impact of the incident,\n\n115\n00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.680\nreturn to normalcy as soon as possible,\nand\n\n116\n00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:26.870\nif at all possible try to not only\nmanage the problem, minimize the impact.\n\n117\n00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.780\nBut we also want to think\nabout being proactive and\n\n118\n00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.660\ntrying to prevent problems before\nthey occur, as we've talked about and\n\n119\n00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.160\nhave really stressed\nthe importance of as well.\n\n120\n00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.090\nMaking sure that we understand and\nthat we are aware of the fact that\n\n121\n00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.650\nit's not just about, hey,\nsomething happened, let's respond.\n\n122\n00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.140\nI mean,\nthat is a very big part of what we do.\n\n123\n00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.390\nBut proactive incident response,\nalthough it's much harder to achieve,\n\n124\n00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.660\nis equally important,\nif we can do it and do it well.\n\n125\n00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.160\nBecause it minimizes the likelihood\n\n126\n00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.930\nthat incidents that do occur will get\nout of hand and cause tremendous damage.\n\n127\n00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.210\nAnd so we have to think about ways we\ncan constantly be on the lookout for\n\n128\n00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.230\nopportunities to be more\nsuccessful at being proactive.\n\n129\n00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.800\nAnd this is one of the challenges,\nwhen you think about this, right?\n\n130\n00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.280\nBecause if we have the proverbial\ncrystal ball of security, and\n\n131\n00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.390\nwe understood how to deal with those\nissues because we can anticipate them,\n\n132\n00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.090\nwell, that would be such an easy thing,\nright?\n\n133\n00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.170\nI mean, it wouldn't be very hard at all to\nbe able to do these things, but we know\n\n134\n00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:26.910\nthat it's very difficult to anticipate\nwhere somebody's gonna break in.\n\n135\n00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.230\nWhat vulnerability are they\ngonna take advantage of?\n\n136\n00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.180\nWhat time and day will that occur and\n\n137\n00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.330\non whose account will that\nactivity be registered?\n\n138\n00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.400\nAnd against what system?\n\n139\n00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.880\nAnd if we knew those things,\nthen our job would be easy,\n\n140\n00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.280\nit wouldn't really be a big deal.\n\n141\n00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.990\nAnd we could all probably work very easy\nhours, we wouldn't have to work very hard,\n\n142\n00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.860\nwouldn't have to get up early, stay late,\nall that kind of stuff, right?\n\n143\n00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.010\nJust wouldn't be an issue.\n\n144\n00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:53.181\nBut, last time I checked, that wasn't part\nof the toolkit that they give you when\n\n145\n00:06:53.181 --> 00:06:56.808\nthey sign you up and say hey, do you\nwanna be in IT, or in IT security, or\n\n146\n00:06:56.808 --> 00:06:58.873\nan incident management professional.\n\n147\n00:06:58.873 --> 00:07:01.720\nThey simply say good bye good luck.\n\n148\n00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.360\nHere's a computer you may\nnot know how to use it and\n\n149\n00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.150\nlet us know if there is\nany questions right?\n\n150\n00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.410\nAnd so\nanticipation of the events is important.\n\n151\n00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:13.840\nBut we can also do harm if we\nanticipate in the wrong direction for\n\n152\n00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.270\nthe wrong reasons with\nthe wrong thought process.\n\n153\n00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.050\nAnd this is the tight rope that\nwe don't often hear about but\n\n154\n00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.400\nwe balance on every diamond\ninformation security.\n\n155\n00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.980\nWe're asked to be an opponent, we're\nasked to be all things to all people,\n\n156\n00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.850\nand understand how to be proactive,\nand anticipate.\n\n157\n00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:31.770\nBut, then we're held accountable, and\nwe're castigated when we're wrong, right?\n\n158\n00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.030\nI mean, damned if you do,\ndamned if you don't, I guess, right,\n\n159\n00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:35.790\nis how you would phrase that.\n\n160\n00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:39.640\nAnd so the problem, in part, with this is,\n\n161\n00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.940\nwe have to figure out ways to try\nto be smarter than the attacker.\n\n162\n00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.021\nBut at the same time, we have to be humble\nenough to understand that we're not gonna\n\n163\n00:07:47.021 --> 00:07:48.353\nbe able to anticipate everything.\n\n164\n00:07:48.353 --> 00:07:51.495\nAnd as a result, we sometimes have\nto lay and wait for the attacker,\n\n165\n00:07:51.495 --> 00:07:55.523\nhoping we're gonna catch them, as opposed\nto anticipating what they're gonna do and\n\n166\n00:07:55.523 --> 00:07:57.090\ntrying to prevent them.\n\n167\n00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:59.814\nAnd it's hard to know which to do when,\nright?\n\n168\n00:07:59.814 --> 00:08:02.746\nI've talked about before the fact\nthat it's one thing to be thought\n\n169\n00:08:02.746 --> 00:08:06.730\nof as an idiot, it's another thing to open\nyour mouth and prove that you are, right?\n\n170\n00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:09.338\nAnd so, perception is part of what we do.\n\n171\n00:08:09.338 --> 00:08:13.701\nYou want the perception of the security\nteam, the incident response team in\n\n172\n00:08:13.701 --> 00:08:17.120\nthe business to be that we\nare better than our adversaries.\n\n173\n00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.590\nThat we can protect you, and\nthat we will keep you safe.\n\n174\n00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:24.232\nBut you can't go overboard and\nmake it appear as if you do no wrong.\n\n175\n00:08:24.232 --> 00:08:26.199\nBecause the reality is you're\ngonna do wrong all the time,\n\n176\n00:08:26.199 --> 00:08:27.230\nyou're gonna make mistakes.\n\n177\n00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:28.620\nIt's just reality of what we do.\n\n178\n00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.761\nWe're gonna be over here when in fact\nsomebody's actually looking to do\n\n179\n00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:33.156\nsomething in a different area.\n\n180\n00:08:33.156 --> 00:08:35.950\nWe're gonna make a mistake\nbecause we're gonna over or\n\n181\n00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:37.860\nunder guess as to what's happening.\n\n182\n00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:40.170\nAnd we're gonna respond with\nthe wrong tool at the wrong time for\n\n183\n00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:41.070\nthe wrong reason.\n\n184\n00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:45.020\nCuz we're not clear on what the incident\nis and we have to do more analysis and\n\n185\n00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.440\nwe're being pushed to come\nup with an answer, right?\n\n186\n00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.220\nNever had one of those things happen,\nright?\n\n187\n00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.770\n&gt;&gt; Mm.\n&gt;&gt; I love the conversation where\n\n188\n00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:54.320\nemails out and the boss is standing over\nyour shoulder going, is it ready yet?\n\n189\n00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:54.998\nIs it ready?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n190\n00:08:54.998 --> 00:08:55.506\n&gt;&gt; Is it ready yet?\n\n191\n00:08:55.506 --> 00:08:56.786\nIt's almost like an are we there yet,\n\n192\n00:08:56.786 --> 00:09:00.130\none of those, except you can't stop and\nthrow them out of the car, right?\n\n193\n00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:03.540\nSo when you're under that\nconstant pressure, right?\n\n194\n00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.060\nFrom the powers that be\nto get some stuff done,\n\n195\n00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.290\nyou may make mistakes just because\nyou're not able to think clearly.\n\n196\n00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:10.750\nAll of this is the brutal,\n\n197\n00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:14.080\ndark reality of what we do everyday\nthat people don't often tell you about.\n\n198\n00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.842\nBut if it was all easy, if it was all\nroses, everybody would be doing it, right?\n\n199\n00:09:17.842 --> 00:09:19.300\nI mean that's just the reality.\n\n200\n00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:22.460\nThe problem is we don't have a lot of\npeople that are skilled doing this\n\n201\n00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:23.120\nand we need more.\n\n202\n00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.560\nAnd we talked about that as well and\nwhy that's so important.\n\n203\n00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:29.520\nSo when we think about the we think about\nthe goals, want to understand those.\n\n204\n00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.330\nWhat about the strategy,\nwhat's the strategy?\n\n205\n00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:36.440\nWhat's the mindset, what's the things that\nwe've got to have and be thinking about?\n\n206\n00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.690\nWe should be positioning ourselves as\na single point of contact for any and\n\n207\n00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:42.835\nall Incident reporting\nmanagement in the organization.\n\n208\n00:09:42.835 --> 00:09:45.875\nIf anything goes wrong,\nit should be washing up on our shore.\n\n209\n00:09:45.875 --> 00:09:49.035\nWe should be looking constantly\nat help desk tickets, and\n\n210\n00:09:49.035 --> 00:09:50.535\nlooking at what's going on.\n\n211\n00:09:50.535 --> 00:09:53.195\nAre we seeing escalation\noccurring the right way?\n\n212\n00:09:53.195 --> 00:09:56.075\nAre incidents flowing into our offices, or\n\n213\n00:09:56.075 --> 00:09:57.865\nare we being made aware\nof them in some way?\n\n214\n00:09:57.865 --> 00:10:01.400\nIf not, we gotta partner with and\nwork with the powers that be to figure out\n\n215\n00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.840\nhow to re-route that traffic and make sure\nit's showing up where it needs to be.\n\n216\n00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.250\nAgain, this goes into this idea in\nthis conversation we often talk about,\n\n217\n00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:11.790\nabout whether it's IT,\nwhether it's security,\n\n218\n00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:16.380\nwhether it's CSIRT incident response,\nincident handling, incident management.\n\n219\n00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:22.590\nWhether it's a variety of different names\nthat are used to refer to essentially,\n\n220\n00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:23.890\nthis function.\n\n221\n00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:25.290\nFill in the gap, fill in the blank.\n\n222\n00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:27.070\nWhatever is in your world, right?\n\n223\n00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.990\nThe issue's not what you call it.\n\n224\n00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:32.440\nThe issue is making sure that\nwhatever everybody calls it\n\n225\n00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.408\nis where all that stuff goes,\n[LAUGH] right?\n\n226\n00:10:34.408 --> 00:10:36.430\nSo as long as it's the security function,\ngreat.\n\n227\n00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:38.610\nJust make sure security\nfinds out about everything.\n\n228\n00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:39.480\nI don't care what you call it,\n\n229\n00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.690\njust wanna make sure that it's\ngoing to the right place, right?\n\n230\n00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:44.088\n&gt;&gt; We'll make a team and\ncall it Purple Squirrels, and hire you.\n\n231\n00:10:44.088 --> 00:10:45.610\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I would love to be,\n\n232\n00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:47.190\n&gt;&gt; You'd actually chase purple squirrels.\n\n233\n00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:49.445\n&gt;&gt; I would love to be the coach\nof the Purple Squirrel franchise.\n\n234\n00:10:49.445 --> 00:10:52.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's almost as cool as the job that I\n\n235\n00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:52.930\ntold you I long for.\n\n236\n00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:54.870\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n&gt;&gt; Which is the Director of\n\n237\n00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:57.418\nthe TLA department,\nThree Letter Acronym department, right?\n\n238\n00:10:57.418 --> 00:10:59.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I want to be the DTLA.\n\n239\n00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.950\n&gt;&gt; The DTLA?\n\n240\n00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:02.070\n&gt;&gt; The Director of the TLA.\n\n241\n00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:02.760\n&gt;&gt; The DoDTLA!\n\n242\n00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.420\n&gt;&gt; The DoDTLA, right, exactly.\n\n243\n00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:07.950\nSo, I wanna be the director of\nthe Three Letter Acronym department.\n\n244\n00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:12.208\nBut whatever it is, whether I'm\nthe coach of the Purple Squirrels.\n\n245\n00:11:12.208 --> 00:11:14.320\nT shirts coming soon,\nwe're gonna be able to market jerseys.\n\n246\n00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.831\nOr, whatever it is, just the goal is\nto make sure that information is routed\n\n247\n00:11:18.831 --> 00:11:21.000\ncorrectly in the organization.\n\n248\n00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.540\nBecause the worst thing we can do is\ndelay our ability to understand and\n\n249\n00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.620\nrespond with regards to\nincident management.\n\n250\n00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:28.505\nIf we do that, chances are good,\n\n251\n00:11:28.505 --> 00:11:33.240\n[COUGH] we've handed the adversary\nthe biggest advantage we can give them.\n\n252\n00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:37.500\nBecause we've actually helped them to\npropagate that attack and make it worse.\n\n253\n00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.490\nBecause they've given us\nthe ability to respond.\n\n254\n00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:43.910\nAnd we've essentially dropped the ball and\nsaid, no, we're gonna kinda do this and\n\n255\n00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:44.940\nfigure out where it goes for\n\n256\n00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.770\nabout 20 minutes before anybody\neven thinks about looking at it.\n\n257\n00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:51.600\nAnd by the time that happens, well,\nwe know they're gonna try to come and go.\n\n258\n00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.060\nAnd they're probably gonna get away,\nright,\n\n259\n00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.490\ncuz we're just not paying attention.\n\n260\n00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:59.770\nSo if we could be focused we're gonna be\na lot more likely to catch the bad people,\n\n261\n00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:01.680\nthe threat source, the bad act right.\n\n262\n00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.992\nIdentify and analysis the impact caused by\ncertain threats is another strategy item\n\n263\n00:12:05.992 --> 00:12:06.670\nfor C Serts.\n\n264\n00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:11.368\nWe gotta be able to understand and\nbring that focus, that attention, that\n\n265\n00:12:11.368 --> 00:12:16.228\nanalytical perspective to the incident and\ndebunk and figure out what it is.\n\n266\n00:12:16.228 --> 00:12:20.013\nAnd then communicate that broadly, widely,\nand effectively to all the teams that have\n\n267\n00:12:20.013 --> 00:12:22.795\nto go into action in order to be\nable to figure out how to respond.\n\n268\n00:12:22.795 --> 00:12:23.995\nThis becomes crucial.\n\n269\n00:12:23.995 --> 00:12:26.115\nIt's really it's all about\nintelligence at the end of the day.\n\n270\n00:12:26.115 --> 00:12:28.905\nWe've got to disseminate broadly,\nwidely and quickly, but\n\n271\n00:12:28.905 --> 00:12:33.515\nalso accurately intelligence that helps\nour responders to go into the field and\n\n272\n00:12:33.515 --> 00:12:35.035\nfigure out how to fight fires.\n\n273\n00:12:35.035 --> 00:12:39.985\nThis is what we often do, find or\ndevelop solutions that are unique,\n\n274\n00:12:39.985 --> 00:12:43.730\nand specific and\ncontextual to mitigate problems on demand.\n\n275\n00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:46.210\nWe're not gonna have all the answers,\nwe're not gonna have all the tools,\n\n276\n00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:49.840\nwe're not gonna know what we have to do\nuntil you describe the incident to me.\n\n277\n00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:53.003\nWhat i have to have is a bench and\na tool bench and people that I\n\n278\n00:12:53.003 --> 00:12:57.058\ncan deploy into those scenarios that\nare gonna figure it out dynamically and\n\n279\n00:12:57.058 --> 00:12:59.678\nthey're gonna come up\nwith the answers we need.\n\n280\n00:12:59.678 --> 00:13:02.180\nThat's what we are looking for.\n\n281\n00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:06.620\nAnd also at the end of the day,\nmake sure we are relentless, and clear and\n\n282\n00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.680\npositive communication up and\ndown the management chain, so\n\n283\n00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.320\nthat stakeholders, senior managers,\nleaders can make accurate and\n\n284\n00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.760\ninformed decisions based\non good intelligence.\n\n285\n00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.515\nBecause without that,\ndespite our best efforts, right,\n\n286\n00:13:18.515 --> 00:13:20.510\nwe could be just spot\non with our response.\n\n287\n00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:21.969\nBut if the stakeholders,\n\n288\n00:13:21.969 --> 00:13:26.411\nthe powers that be in the organization\nare getting just incorrect or unclear and\n\n289\n00:13:26.411 --> 00:13:31.320\nincomplete intelligence, they're not gonna\nmake the decisions that are necessary to\n\n290\n00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:34.870\ngive us the support we need to\ncontinue doing what we got to do.\n\n291\n00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:36.550\nIt would be very difficult to do that.\n\n292\n00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:40.160\nSo we have to really focus on clear and\npositive communication as well.\n\n293\n00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.720\nIt's very, very important.\n\n294\n00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.900\nYou'll have a lot of different ways of\nreferring to the CSERT as I mentioned.\n\n295\n00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.750\nThere's all these different names,\nthought processes.\n\n296\n00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:51.810\nWe hear computer incident response teams,\nCIRT, C-I-R-T a lot.\n\n297\n00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:56.630\nWe hear incident handling team,\nincident response team, IHT, IRT.\n\n298\n00:13:56.630 --> 00:14:01.040\nSecurity emergency response team,\nSERT but spelled S-E-R-T.\n\n299\n00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:05.180\nWe hear security incident response\nteam SIRT spelled SI R T.\n\n300\n00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.395\nThere's all these different ways of\nreferring to this thought process.\n\n301\n00:14:08.395 --> 00:14:10.850\nDoesn't really matter,\nas I said, what it is.\n\n302\n00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:15.170\nWhat matters is everybody is clear on the\nacronym, everybody understands the goal,\n\n303\n00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:19.730\nand everybody is then understanding the\nmechanism and the methodology to allow for\n\n304\n00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:23.510\ncommunication and\nenabling action around that intelligence.\n\n305\n00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:25.330\nThat's really what's\ngonna be most important.\n\n306\n00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:26.650\nYou know when I walk into a company, and\n\n307\n00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:30.340\nI can tell you, almost immediately when I\nwalk into the company to do an audit or\n\n308\n00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:34.160\nI'm asked to come in and spend some\ntime talking with and consulting or\n\n309\n00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.750\nwhatever I may do in regards to helping\ncustomers better understand their\n\n310\n00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:42.070\nenvironment, their technology, their needs\nand how they're going to deploy things.\n\n311\n00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:43.394\nYou know, whatever the case is.\n\n312\n00:14:43.394 --> 00:14:47.099\nI can tell almost immediately within\na few minutes of being there, whether or\n\n313\n00:14:47.099 --> 00:14:50.747\nnot I'm gonna be successful at what I need\nto do just based on a general read of\n\n314\n00:14:50.747 --> 00:14:52.400\nthe culture of the organization.\n\n315\n00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:56.504\nYou know if I see everybody communicating\nand I see them using common language and\n\n316\n00:14:56.504 --> 00:14:58.434\ntalking about things in a common way,\n\n317\n00:14:58.434 --> 00:15:01.932\nI have a pretty good idea that they\nprobably got good documentation,\n\n318\n00:15:01.932 --> 00:15:06.071\nthey've got a good central thought\nprocess around collaboration and culture.\n\n319\n00:15:06.071 --> 00:15:08.260\nThey've probably got a good\nchain of management process.\n\n320\n00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.170\nThey probably have a decent\nincident response solution and\n\n321\n00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:15.880\nthey're gonna be able to understand how to\ncommunicate information and share broadly.\n\n322\n00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:20.190\nIf I walk in and I see kind of\na tribal mentality, a lot of silos,\n\n323\n00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:25.070\ndifferent little groups of people, or\nislands dissociated from one another,\n\n324\n00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:28.320\nkinda drifting free,\nI know it's gonna be a challenge, right?\n\n325\n00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:32.715\nBecause I know just based on years of\nexperience, that it's gonna be difficult\n\n326\n00:15:32.715 --> 00:15:35.880\nfor me to work with more than\none group and be successful.\n\n327\n00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:39.958\nBecause there's a lack of ability to\nbe able to translate that data, right,\n\n328\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.770\nessentially, and create that commonality.\n\n329\n00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:45.456\nThat culture that allows us\nto communicate effectively,\n\n330\n00:15:45.456 --> 00:15:47.167\nbecause we speak the same language.\n\n331\n00:15:47.167 --> 00:15:51.453\nAnd so that's a very big tell,\na very big telling sign around whether or\n\n332\n00:15:51.453 --> 00:15:55.610\nnot we can afford to be able to spend\ntime doing things And if so, how?\n\n333\n00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:57.514\nAnd how successful are we gonna be?\n\n334\n00:15:57.514 --> 00:15:59.820\nSo what's the importance\nof the C Cert ultimately?\n\n335\n00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.600\nRight, we need to describe that and\ncommunicate that.\n\n336\n00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.190\nWe need a mission statement, we need\nsomething that trumpets to the world\n\n337\n00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:10.240\nour abilities and also tells them how to\nhold us accountable because we're clearly\n\n338\n00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:13.990\ndefining for everybody around us what\nthe expectations are to measure us by.\n\n339\n00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:15.680\nThat's what a mission statement does.\n\n340\n00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:20.640\nSo the mission statement should first\ninform us without fail always in any\n\n341\n00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:24.460\norganization for any reason always\nhave the support of senior leadership.\n\n342\n00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.230\nOne of the most important\nthings we can do is get by and\n\n343\n00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:32.020\nfrom the very beginning, from senior\nleadership, get them to sign off on and\n\n344\n00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:34.350\nsupport through action word indeed.\n\n345\n00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:38.050\nOur desire, our goal, our mission and\nwhat we're looking to accomplish.\n\n346\n00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:41.180\nIf we have that,\nessentially the sky's the limit, right?\n\n347\n00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:44.080\nIf we don't, good luck trying to get\nanything done because you're just not\n\n348\n00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.660\ngonna have the resources to do it.\n\n349\n00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.580\nAnd even if you get lucky\nenough to figure it out,\n\n350\n00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:49.240\nno one's gonna pay any\nattention to you anyway.\n\n351\n00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.260\nBecause no one's gonna take you seriously.\n\n352\n00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.080\nSo if you don't have\nsenior management support.\n\n353\n00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.090\nYou're done before you start,\nunfortunately.\n\n354\n00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:58.510\nIt's one of the most important\nthings we talk about.\n\n355\n00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:00.810\nIn addition,\nwe need to be able to establish and\n\n356\n00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:03.310\nreally think through from\na mission statement perspective.\n\n357\n00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:05.820\nThe fact that we wanna be able\nto establish a service and\n\n358\n00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:09.300\nquality point of reference and\nframework in the organization.\n\n359\n00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.410\nThrough the use of the C CERT\nto drive incident response.\n\n360\n00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:15.630\nAnd as a result,\nthis is one of the key touchstones.\n\n361\n00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:19.300\nThe milestones that we look to establish\nthrough the use of a mission statement.\n\n362\n00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.420\nThe definition of our policy and procedure\nshould be driven through the mission\n\n363\n00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:25.920\nstatement and the quality of service\nthat we provide needs to be clear and\n\n364\n00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.920\narticulate through the mission\nstatement as well.\n\n365\n00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:31.140\nThese are the things that are necessary\nfor us to be able to figure out how to\n\n366\n00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:34.780\ncommunicate effectively within\nthe framework of the mission statement.\n\n367\n00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:39.391\nIf we're not able to do that, difficult\nfor us to understand how and when and\n\n368\n00:17:39.391 --> 00:17:43.877\nwhere and why we're gonna be successful\nand how we measure that success.\n\n369\n00:17:43.877 --> 00:17:45.777\nI love and I do a lot of work\nwith different industries.\n\n370\n00:17:45.777 --> 00:17:51.670\nI do a lot of work on the service\nindustries I love the service industries.\n\n371\n00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:53.720\nI think they're so vital to what we do and\n\n372\n00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:57.000\nthey're vital to all of ability\nto consume and to be successful.\n\n373\n00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.770\nPeople work incredibly hard in these\nindustries and are under appreciated.\n\n374\n00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:04.220\nWithout any discussion or\nwithout anything else needing to be said.\n\n375\n00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.680\nCuz you just don't make enough money\nwhen you're working these industries,\n\n376\n00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.330\ntaking care of people and\nservicing their needs.\n\n377\n00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:14.060\nWe would all probably do a lot more and be\nbetter off if we remember that more often.\n\n378\n00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:16.950\nBut you know what I work with\nsome of these industries.\n\n379\n00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:19.220\nAnd you think about drive throughs\nespecially in this regard.\n\n380\n00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:22.920\nWith regards to mission statements and\nhow we measure success and\n\n381\n00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.530\nwhat success equals.\n\n382\n00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:27.810\nWhen you go to a typical drive through,\nwe're talking usually for\n\n383\n00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:28.760\na restaurant of some kind.\n\n384\n00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:32.240\nSo a fast food establishment,\ncoffee shop, take your pick.\n\n385\n00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:32.980\nWhatever it could be.\n\n386\n00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:34.370\nDry cleaner perhaps.\n\n387\n00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:35.660\nLots of places have drive through.\n\n388\n00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:39.200\nRight, but there's certain places\nyou go to that you just know\n\n389\n00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.870\nthat the experience is gonna be good,\nand you know that you may have to wait.\n\n390\n00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:44.050\nI have no trouble being patient.\n\n391\n00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:47.620\nLook, I understand I'm not the only\nperson that needs to get something,\n\n392\n00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:48.720\nI'm not the only person.\n\n393\n00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.790\nThat's important,\nI don't have any of those issues.\n\n394\n00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:55.180\nBut you know what I can't tolerate, and\nI really have trouble tolerating is,\n\n395\n00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:58.720\nbeing made to wait because people\nare just not good at doing their job.\n\n396\n00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.500\nI understand that if there's a lot of\npeople and you only have two people,\n\n397\n00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.500\nyou're just gonna have to be patient,\nthey'll get to you.\n\n398\n00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:06.490\nBut if there's only two people\nworking behind the desk, and\n\n399\n00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:09.470\nthose two people both together\ndon't equal one person,\n\n400\n00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:13.290\nI get really frustrated really\nquickly when I'm being made to wait.\n\n401\n00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:17.130\nAnd so when I think of mission statements\nand I think of looking at missions\n\n402\n00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:21.690\nstatements and seeing what people, what\nentities claim is what they're trying to\n\n403\n00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:26.440\ndo, I view that as, essentially, a service\npromise, as many of us probably do.\n\n404\n00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:29.690\nAnd if you go to the trouble of publishing\nthat and putting it up and saying this is\n\n405\n00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:34.250\nwhat we're gonna do and then you don't\ndo that you're essentially lying to me.\n\n406\n00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:36.140\nAnd I don't know you that well.\n\n407\n00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:40.560\n[LAUGH] So lying to me is just,\nit is what it is but my point is that,\n\n408\n00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:44.500\nif your going to make a mission\nstatement create a value promise and\n\n409\n00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:47.600\na service promise by stating\nwhat your looking to do.\n\n410\n00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:49.510\nAnd then you have to live up to it.\n\n411\n00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:52.050\nBecause people come to rely\non the fact that that's\n\n412\n00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:53.880\nthe expectation that you've given them.\n\n413\n00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:54.690\nAnd that's what you're gonna do.\n\n414\n00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:55.860\nYou're promising them something.\n\n415\n00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:58.730\nSo when we think about creating\na C Cert mission statement,\n\n416\n00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:02.340\nwe think about the fact, which you should\nthink about the facts and some handlers\n\n417\n00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:06.680\nthat you're creating a value brand and a\npromise around that service commitment and\n\n418\n00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.650\nthat you have to be willing\nto stand on that and\n\n419\n00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:11.180\ndeliver on that inside\nof the organization.\n\n420\n00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:13.980\nWe also talked about\nthe C Cert constituency.\n\n421\n00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.770\nWhat is the constituency?\n\n422\n00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:20.710\nAnd I know that this gentleman right here,\nright over here, this one over here.\n\n423\n00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:21.290\n&gt;&gt; That, that.\n\n424\n00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:22.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, him, right there.\n\n425\n00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:24.980\nI know he knows how to spell constituency.\n\n426\n00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:25.600\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n427\n00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.580\n&gt;&gt; He does.\n&gt;&gt; I can do it.\n\n428\n00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:27.705\n&gt;&gt; I'm not gonna tell you how I know.\n\n429\n00:20:27.705 --> 00:20:29.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I'm gonna tell you that I do know\n\n430\n00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.100\nhe knows how to spell constituency.\n\n431\n00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.840\nAnd it's not an easy word to spell.\n\n432\n00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.020\n&gt;&gt; It's tricky.\n&gt;&gt; As he also knows.\n\n433\n00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:35.580\nBut he also knows how\nto spell it correctly.\n\n434\n00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.040\nAnd I do appreciate that by the way.\n\n435\n00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:37.900\n&gt;&gt; No problem.\n&gt;&gt; So thank you for\n\n436\n00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:39.300\ntaking care of that for us.\n\n437\n00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:40.770\nSo constituency, yeah.\n\n438\n00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:43.470\nWe were talking a bit about this\nbefore we decided to do this episode.\n\n439\n00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:46.420\nEpisode and get this show done for\nyou right now and you know the idea of\n\n440\n00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:50.040\nconstituency is the idea of the audience\nthat we are serving, right?\n\n441\n00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:56.400\nSo the CCERT constituency is the audience\nthat the CCERT is bound to serve.\n\n442\n00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.940\nIs it a one organization CCERT?\n\n443\n00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:02.850\nWere just operating within,\nwhat we call internal organization.\n\n444\n00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:05.100\nAre we a regional or federal or\n\n445\n00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:10.250\na national CCERT that is taking care\nof an area of geography, a country.\n\n446\n00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:13.250\nAre we, in other words, in the US CERT?\n\n447\n00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:15.130\nAre we a German government CERT?\n\n448\n00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:18.120\nThere's all these different\nones that exist by country.\n\n449\n00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.120\nBut many companies have\ntheir own internally.\n\n450\n00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:25.200\nSo the constituency, it's really the idea\nof the audience that we are attached to,\n\n451\n00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.100\nessentially, and\nthat we're committed to service.\n\n452\n00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.330\nSo, wanna think about that.\n\n453\n00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:32.360\nThe relationship of the CCERT to\nthe constituency is interesting.\n\n454\n00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.820\nSo we have three different\npotential grades, or\n\n455\n00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:37.030\nareas of relationship that we can look at.\n\n456\n00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:40.580\nWe can have a full, we can have a shared,\nor we can have none.\n\n457\n00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:42.930\nAnd when we think about\na full relationship, or\n\n458\n00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:47.550\nwe think about the full authorization for\nthe CCERT, what we're thinking about is\n\n459\n00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:51.600\nthat the CCERT's been given, essentially,\nthe blind trust of the organization and\n\n460\n00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.830\nbeen told, you have full authority\nto operate on our behalf.\n\n461\n00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:58.400\nAnd react in any and similar situation and\ntake appropriate steps and\n\n462\n00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.650\napply counter measures.\n\n463\n00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:01.600\nAnd you do what you need\nto do to keep us safe.\n\n464\n00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:06.490\nThat's, essentially, what we would think\nof as that relationship in that way.\n\n465\n00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:11.100\nWhen we think of a shared relationship,\nthe teacher acts in partnership with\n\n466\n00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:15.890\nthe organization, but has to consult in\norder to achieve the desired outcomes,\n\n467\n00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:19.870\nit has to seek permission and engage\nin a dialogue before they go out and\n\n468\n00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:21.180\nactually remediate.\n\n469\n00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:23.990\nAnd then if we have none as\nthe relationship category,\n\n470\n00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:27.000\nwe are strictly asked to\nact in an advisory or\n\n471\n00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.030\nconsultancy capacity when we are sought\nout by the organization or by the entity.\n\n472\n00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:35.103\nThey will come and ask us our opinion.\n\n473\n00:22:35.103 --> 00:22:38.740\nPerhaps ask us to define\na course of action but\n\n474\n00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:41.520\nthen the customer may earn through\nthe task and may go of and\n\n475\n00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:45.310\ndo their own things we are most\nlikely not involved in that response.\n\n476\n00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:48.030\nWe simply are the purveyors of the advice.\n\n477\n00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:49.460\nFor lack of a better way describing it.\n\n478\n00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:52.500\nSo when we think about the relationships,\nand\n\n479\n00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.910\nthink about how those are gonna evolve,\nand\n\n480\n00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:58.420\nultimately how they are framed,\nwanna understand the logic of this.\n\n481\n00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:02.060\nBecause, if we invest in\nthe resources to build a CCert\n\n482\n00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:05.090\ncapability inside our own company,\nwe essentially own that.\n\n483\n00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:08.190\nIt's ours, and\nwe're fully empowering it to keep us safe.\n\n484\n00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:12.280\nBut if we're gonna rely on an external\nCCert, we may not give them that same\n\n485\n00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.930\npower of authority,\nbecause we don't control them directly.\n\n486\n00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:16.140\nAnd so, we have to think about that and\n\n487\n00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:18.630\nunderstand how that\nrelationship may evolve, right?\n\n488\n00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:22.808\nIt's the 3 shades of grey, as opposed\nto 50 shades of grey conversation.\n\n489\n00:23:22.808 --> 00:23:26.230\nSo the CCERT place in\nthe organization is interesting and\n\n490\n00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:30.300\nprofound because we don't always\nhave access to the full CCERT or\n\n491\n00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:33.120\nthe resources associated with\nit because we may not have\n\n492\n00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:37.460\nthe ability to be able to afford to\nkeep a CCERT inside the organization.\n\n493\n00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:40.725\nBudgetary and other concerns\nmay prevent us from doing that.\n\n494\n00:23:40.725 --> 00:23:45.094\nBut we may be able to, especially these\ndays, with everything as a service,\n\n495\n00:23:45.094 --> 00:23:48.454\nkind of on demand,\ncloud based solutions, we can rent, or\n\n496\n00:23:48.454 --> 00:23:53.230\nget access to this expertise, if necessary\nSo there's a lot of different variables\n\n497\n00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:57.150\nthat go into the C search role in\nthe organization and its place.\n\n498\n00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:59.870\nThere's no right and wrong but\nwe just have to understand that it may be\n\n499\n00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:03.880\nfully embedded and it may be an external\nor a kind of a shared responsibility or\n\n500\n00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:07.190\nit could just be a consultants fee\nthat is available just on demand.\n\n501\n00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:08.940\nPay as you go kind of thing, right?\n\n502\n00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:13.310\nCSIRT as a service, so\nCSIRT ASS, essentially.\n\n503\n00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:14.010\n&gt;&gt; That's fun.\n[LAUGH]\n\n504\n00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:14.520\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n505\n00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:16.880\nSo different types of CSIRTs.\n\n506\n00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:19.480\nWe mentioned there's the embedded,\nor the internal one.\n\n507\n00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:22.995\nThere's the national CSIRT, I mentioned\nregional or federal or national,\n\n508\n00:24:22.995 --> 00:24:24.787\ndepending on the geography.\n\n509\n00:24:24.787 --> 00:24:27.745\nThe CSIRT as an analysis center,\nkind of looking at, and\n\n510\n00:24:27.745 --> 00:24:31.655\ncreating a clearing house where they\ndisseminate information and pull it out,\n\n511\n00:24:31.655 --> 00:24:36.747\nupdates, and and things like that,\nso the US-SIRT through\n\n512\n00:24:36.747 --> 00:24:39.997\nthe Department of Homeland Security\nfulfills this function in the US.\n\n513\n00:24:39.997 --> 00:24:42.797\nMany of the national CSIRTs will do this.\n\n514\n00:24:42.797 --> 00:24:47.287\nThe SCI, the Software Engineering\nInstitute at Carnegie Mellon,\n\n515\n00:24:47.287 --> 00:24:50.497\nruns the MITRE database,\nthe vulnerability database.\n\n516\n00:24:50.497 --> 00:24:54.537\nThey act in an advisory and\na information-sharing capacity for\n\n517\n00:24:54.537 --> 00:24:56.057\ninformation security professionals.\n\n518\n00:24:56.057 --> 00:24:58.760\nLots of examples of this\nkind of activity that go on.\n\n519\n00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:02.540\nThe CSIRT as a vendor team or\nincident response team, where essentially\n\n520\n00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:06.930\nthey're the pay as you go model, you buy\ntheir services and use them on demand.\n\n521\n00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:09.500\nSo, there's a lot of companies\nout there that specialize in\n\n522\n00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:10.810\ncertain kinds of activities.\n\n523\n00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:14.010\nIn the forensics space, for\ninstance, you see this a lot where\n\n524\n00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:17.790\ncompanies need incident response, and\nthey need forensic incident response.\n\n525\n00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:20.750\nThey'll go out and rent or\nbuy that from a company.\n\n526\n00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:24.191\nAll these on demand IT management\nsolutions you hear about today any and\n\n527\n00:25:24.191 --> 00:25:26.940\nall these things will kind of\nfall into this category, so\n\n528\n00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:30.010\njust thinking about some of\nthat kind of stuff, right?\n\n529\n00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:34.470\nBest practices that we may wanna follow\naround how a CSIRT gets spun up, what it\n\n530\n00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:38.730\nlooks like, how we actually walk through\nthe lifecycle of getting it organized.\n\n531\n00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:40.779\nThere's usually seven steps\nwe often think about here.\n\n532\n00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:45.840\nFirst and foremost, no matter what we do,\nwe always start out at the same place,\n\n533\n00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.910\nright, it's the follow\nthe yellow brick road analogy.\n\n534\n00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:50.840\nYellow brick road always starts out as the\nlittle point in the middle of the center\n\n535\n00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.680\nsquare and then it kind of winds\naround and it goes out and\n\n536\n00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:59.100\nbecomes this very long, yellow brick road.\n\n537\n00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:00.630\nAptly named, of course, right?\n\n538\n00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:03.380\nIt's not follow the purple road,\nit's follow the yellow brick road.\n\n539\n00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:04.890\nSo the first thing we do, time and\n\n540\n00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:07.420\nagain without fail,\nalways obtain management support.\n\n541\n00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:08.470\nWe talked about this, right?\n\n542\n00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:09.830\nSenior management support.\n\n543\n00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:12.030\nStakeholder support here or\nfor two different ways.\n\n544\n00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:14.460\nWhatever it is,\nnumber one at the top of list,\n\n545\n00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:17.620\nif we don't have that, might as well not\neven show up and do anything else, right?\n\n546\n00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:19.410\nGotta have management support.\n\n547\n00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:21.590\nGotta then determine the strategic plan.\n\n548\n00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:23.945\nGotta build a management and say,\nit's okay, this is what we want to do.\n\n549\n00:26:23.945 --> 00:26:25.325\nGreat, Adam, no problem.\n\n550\n00:26:25.325 --> 00:26:29.155\nBut guess what, we need to have a plan\nthat we're gonna get behind and support.\n\n551\n00:26:29.155 --> 00:26:31.635\nSo go back, figure it out,\ncome back and tell us.\n\n552\n00:26:31.635 --> 00:26:32.465\nLet's all agree.\n\n553\n00:26:32.465 --> 00:26:34.575\nAnd then once we have it in writing,\nthat's what we're gonna do.\n\n554\n00:26:34.575 --> 00:26:36.105\nNo problem, I got that.\n\n555\n00:26:36.105 --> 00:26:37.835\nGather relevant information.\n\n556\n00:26:37.835 --> 00:26:41.805\nYou check with peers and colleagues,\nexamine what other companies are doing.\n\n557\n00:26:41.805 --> 00:26:45.415\nLearn from their good and\nbads, do's and don'ts.\n\n558\n00:26:45.415 --> 00:26:47.610\nCheck the industry,\nfind out what's relevant.\n\n559\n00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:52.535\nTalk to other practitioners,\nfind out what they're doing.\n\n560\n00:26:52.535 --> 00:26:55.230\nYou investigate inside\nthe other organization.\n\n561\n00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:58.880\nInterview people, find out what their\nneeds, concerns, wants, desires, hopes,\n\n562\n00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.080\ndreams are, right?\n\n563\n00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.110\nAll that kinda stuff,\n\n564\n00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:05.310\nput it all together in the blender and\nthen come up with a way to address those.\n\n565\n00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:06.420\nDesign the vision, right?\n\n566\n00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:08.330\nSo we gotta then distill that down.\n\n567\n00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:12.020\nCommunicate the vision, cuz remember,\nbroad, wide communication very,\n\n568\n00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:13.350\nvery critical.\n\n569\n00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:14.880\nImplement the actual CSIRT.\n\n570\n00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.800\nWe don't actually turn this thing on and\n\n571\n00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:19.050\ngo live until almost the end\nof the process, right?\n\n572\n00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:21.830\nImplement the CSIRT\nafter all the planning,\n\n573\n00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:26.550\nthe collaboration, communication,\nnegotiation, and politicking is done.\n\n574\n00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:28.020\nActually go ahead and do it.\n\n575\n00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:32.110\nAnd then last but not least,\nannounce that the CSIRT is operational.\n\n576\n00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:35.930\nTell everybody that you're in business and\nmake sure they understand the value of\n\n577\n00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:38.550\nwhat you're doing and\nshow them the success, right?\n\n578\n00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:39.960\nShow me the money, as we say.\n\n579\n00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.700\nShow me the success.\n\n580\n00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.440\nGo out and solve a problem.\n\n581\n00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:47.170\nGo out stop an incident and then announce\nto the world that you're there and\n\n582\n00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:48.460\nthat you're doing a good job, right?\n\n583\n00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:51.190\nThis becomes very important for\nus to think about,\n\n584\n00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:56.610\nbecause this is the practice methodology,\nthe process we're supposed to engage in\n\n585\n00:27:56.610 --> 00:28:01.100\nin order to be able to spin the CSIRT up\nand ensure that it's gonna be successful.\n\n586\n00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:02.630\nVery, very important for us, too.\n\n587\n00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:04.420\nYou'll kinda think through\nthe logic of that,\n\n588\n00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:07.930\nespecially if we don't have all\nthose things done up top, right?\n\n589\n00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:09.640\nWe don't have the management buy in.\n\n590\n00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.020\nWe don't have the strategy.\n\n591\n00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:14.790\nWe don't have the plan, the vision and\nwe just rush to declare victory and say,\n\n592\n00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:16.920\nokay, we're open for business.\n\n593\n00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:19.880\nAnd then things go horribly wrong, and\neverybody stands around going, well,\n\n594\n00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:23.220\nwhy did we rush to say we could do this,\nwhen we don't even know what we're doing?\n\n595\n00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:24.560\nI mean, what was the point of that, right?\n\n596\n00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:28.020\nWe screwed it up worse than if we just\nlet it, kind of left it alone and\n\n597\n00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:29.290\ndidn't bother with it in the first place.\n\n598\n00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:30.145\n&gt;&gt; So a government thing.\n\n599\n00:28:30.145 --> 00:28:32.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, essentially.\n\n600\n00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.840\nKind of like that.\n\n601\n00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.460\nI was trying to be politically correct and\nnot go down that road, but\n\n602\n00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:37.430\nsince you stepped into the swamp.\n\n603\n00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:38.260\nAbsolutely.\n\n604\n00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:40.300\nDon't act like the government,\nessentially, right?\n\n605\n00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:41.510\nWe don't want to do that.\n\n606\n00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:44.490\nBut just think about the logic of\nwhat we're suggesting here, right?\n\n607\n00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:47.828\nThere is a method to the madness, in other\nwords, is what I'm kind of putting across.\n\n608\n00:28:47.828 --> 00:28:51.860\nAnd we wanna make sure we have all of our\nducks in a row and that we are able to\n\n609\n00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:55.830\nactually create the success that we are\npromising before we actually operational.\n\n610\n00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:57.370\nVery, very important.\n\n611\n00:28:57.370 --> 00:28:58.000\n&gt;&gt; Excellent stuff.\n\n612\n00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.810\nWe're talking CSIRTs today.\n\n613\n00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:01.800\nDefinitely an interesting topic.\n\n614\n00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:02.630\nA lot to think about.\n\n615\n00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:03.900\nWhat goes inside of a team?\n\n616\n00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:04.550\nWhy are we there?\n\n617\n00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:06.860\nGet the mission statement, constituencies.\n\n618\n00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:12.180\nLots of things that we need take into\naccount when we're developing our CSIRT.\n\n619\n00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:13.750\nIs it redundant to say team after that?\n\n620\n00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:16.150\nI guess it would be cuz the T in CCIRT.\n\n621\n00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:17.300\n&gt;&gt; Just do CSIRT.\n\n622\n00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:18.223\n&gt;&gt; Just the CSIRT.\n\n623\n00:29:18.223 --> 00:29:19.004\nThere you go.\n\n624\n00:29:19.004 --> 00:29:22.060\n[LAUGH] Don't be redundant,\npeople, with your acronyms.\n\n625\n00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:25.460\nBut I know you got a little bit\nmore that we need to talk about in\n\n626\n00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:27.030\nregards to CSIRT stuff.\n\n627\n00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:29.800\n&gt;&gt; But I'm looking at our clock, we're\nabout out of time for this episode, so\n\n628\n00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:32.240\nit looks like we're gonna\nhave to roll into a part two.\n\n629\n00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:35.910\nWe do thank you guys for watching,\nthough, but does look like it's time

00:00:12.447\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.447 --> 00:00:14.318\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:14.318 --> 00:00:17.450\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.790\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n7\n00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.510\nin today's episode we are back\nwith more on our ECIH series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.210\nAnd of course joining us in the studio yet\nagain, our good friend and mentor,\n\n9\n00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.160\nMr Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.610\nAdam, welcome back sirm how goes it today?\n\n11\n00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.978\n&gt;&gt; It goes well as opposed to not going\nwell, which is always a good thing.\n\n12\n00:00:32.978 --> 00:00:34.589\n&gt;&gt; That's good.\n&gt;&gt; As opposed to a bad thing.\n\n13\n00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:35.487\n&gt;&gt; It's good that you're good.\n\n14\n00:00:35.487 --> 00:00:36.453\n&gt;&gt; We'll just say that I'm good.\n\n15\n00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:37.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we'll be good with that and\n\n16\n00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.211\nwe'll move along.\n\n17\n00:00:38.211 --> 00:00:40.850\n&gt;&gt; I'm good.\n&gt;&gt; So hopefully you're all good as well.\n\n18\n00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.730\nWe're gonna continue our conversations\nabout Incident Handling.\n\n19\n00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.790\nWe've been speaking\nabout the CSIRT concept,\n\n20\n00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.500\ncomputer security\ninformation response team.\n\n21\n00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.810\nHow do we form that,\nwhat does that look like,\n\n22\n00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.670\nwhat's the importance of it,\nwhy do we need it?\n\n23\n00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.176\nAnd where we left off in our\nlast episode discussing things,\n\n24\n00:00:58.176 --> 00:01:01.971\nthat's really around the concepts\nsurrounding the [INAUDIBLE].\n\n25\n00:01:01.971 --> 00:01:04.682\nWanted to double a little deeper\ntalk about the instant or\n\n26\n00:01:04.682 --> 00:01:06.610\nresponse team from a role perspective.\n\n27\n00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.340\nWhat are some of the roles\nwe're gonna see,\n\n28\n00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.120\nwhat do they look like,\nwho are the people indoor?\n\n29\n00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.680\nWhat are the roles that fulfill\nthe various activities and\n\n30\n00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.120\nresponsibilities that a team\nlike this would need?\n\n31\n00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.842\nRemember, we're typically going to\nbe mapping to not to individuals,\n\n32\n00:01:21.842 --> 00:01:24.657\nI'm not gonna say Daniel\nis my incident coordinator.\n\n33\n00:01:24.657 --> 00:01:29.565\nBut rather I'm gonna say I need\nan incident coordinator, let's assign that\n\n34\n00:01:29.565 --> 00:01:34.186\nrole to maybe one or more people, but\nif we say it's Daniel all the time.\n\n35\n00:01:34.186 --> 00:01:38.303\nProblem is, if Daniel is not there\nlike we may not know who to go to and\n\n36\n00:01:38.303 --> 00:01:41.265\ndoor we may not have a fall\nback right an altar nd so\n\n37\n00:01:41.265 --> 00:01:45.537\nwe wanna think this from a row\nperspective As supposed to from me.\n\n38\n00:01:45.537 --> 00:01:49.977\nHey it's this persons perspective and\nit's general methodology for teens, right?\n\n39\n00:01:49.977 --> 00:01:52.317\nRegardless of where we are what we do,\n\n40\n00:01:52.317 --> 00:01:57.040\nif I have a set of roles I'm a domain\nadmin I'm a backup operator.\n\n41\n00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:04.014\nI am a key master, little Ghostbuster\nreference for you, the right?\n\n42\n00:02:04.014 --> 00:02:09.838\nAnd the key master, so if I am the PKI\nperson who does public key infrastructure,\n\n43\n00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:14.222\nmanages certificates deals\nwith keys in the organization.\n\n44\n00:02:14.222 --> 00:02:18.591\nI dont wanna be known as Adam the key guy,\nI wanna be known as Pki administrator,\n\n45\n00:02:18.591 --> 00:02:21.854\nbecause then if somebody else\nis either cross-training or\n\n46\n00:02:21.854 --> 00:02:26.027\ncomes in behind me, and back stops me,\nor just we have more than one person,\n\n47\n00:02:26.027 --> 00:02:28.250\nmaybe Daniel and I share that role.\n\n48\n00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.090\nRight, you dont wanna be known as the\nindividual, because the problem is you tie\n\n49\n00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.650\nthat in the minds of the users\nto that person as a role,\n\n50\n00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.900\nand then when that person's not in role,\nthey're lost.\n\n51\n00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.232\nThey just don't know what to do, right?\n\n52\n00:02:41.232 --> 00:02:43.285\nI mean this becomes major issue.\n\n53\n00:02:43.285 --> 00:02:47.792\nAnd so I much prefer when I talk with\ncustomers, when I talk with students,\n\n54\n00:02:47.792 --> 00:02:51.313\nwhen I you do this kind of work\nto get people to think about.\n\n55\n00:02:51.313 --> 00:02:55.352\nLet's define the role, let's write up\na role responsibility description,\n\n56\n00:02:55.352 --> 00:02:59.942\nlet's make sure everybody understands what\nthe role is, let's definitely tell people\n\n57\n00:02:59.942 --> 00:03:03.550\nwho is mastering that role right now and\nwho is gonna be.\n\n58\n00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.919\nBut let's make sure in our BCDR\ndocumentation, our business continuity\n\n59\n00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:14.202\ndisaster recovery documentation,\nin our IRP incident response plan,\n\n60\n00:03:14.202 --> 00:03:19.067\nin our general documentation for\nour configuration management.\n\n61\n00:03:19.067 --> 00:03:22.978\nOur baseline builds our CIs,\nour configuration items in all the places,\n\n62\n00:03:22.978 --> 00:03:27.012\nwherever we write this stuff down,\nand there are many, many places where,\n\n63\n00:03:27.012 --> 00:03:28.940\nin theory, we would do this.\n\n64\n00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.060\nLet's make sure that we have the role\ndesignated, and then we have a fill\n\n65\n00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.750\nin the blank kind of concept for whoever\nis on point, or on call for that role.\n\n66\n00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.510\nBut we understand it's the role first, and\nthe person that it happens as opposed to\n\n67\n00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.210\nit's Adam, and by the way Adam\ndoes all these things, right.\n\n68\n00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.930\nBecause that's just realistically gonna\nbe a very problematic way to approach\n\n69\n00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:49.690\nmanagement of this.\n\n70\n00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.400\nSo when we think about this and we talk\nabout incident response team roles,\n\n71\n00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.920\nlet's in your mind make sure\nthat you're thinking that way.\n\n72\n00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.000\nAnd if you're not, and\ncurrently your organization culturally or\n\n73\n00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.700\noperationally just doesn't\noperate this way that's okay.\n\n74\n00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.320\nThere's nothing wrong with that,\nright, there's no right and\n\n75\n00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.470\nwrong with regards to, hey,\nI'm doing it this way.\n\n76\n00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.970\nIs that a good or bad thing?\n\n77\n00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.720\nThe fact that you've assigned\nresponsibility, the fact you have somebody\n\n78\n00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.050\ndesignated to do tha,t is the most\nimportant thing you can do.\n\n79\n00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.140\nWhat we want to do is just fine tune,\ntweak that a little bit.\n\n80\n00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.620\nLet's make sure that it's easy to\ndiagnose and understand where to go and\n\n81\n00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.860\nwhere to go and report that information.\n\n82\n00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.500\nRegardless of who may be the name\non the line, is all I'm suggesting.\n\n83\n00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.740\nAnd with small and\n\n84\n00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.490\nmedium customers, I find that\nit's usually person based, right?\n\n85\n00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.550\nIt's it's Daniel, or it's Adam,\n\n86\n00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.980\nbecause you're small enough as a business\nthat that's just how you do things, right?\n\n87\n00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.000\nWhen you're small, so\nit is kind of that mom and pop,\n\n88\n00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.420\nthat entrepreneur mentality\nwe often hear about, and\n\n89\n00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.800\nbecause everybody's kind of in\nthere doing a lot of stuff.\n\n90\n00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.540\nAnd everybody wears a lot of hats,\nwe've got to think along those lines, but\n\n91\n00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.050\nas we get bigger, and bigger's a relative\nthing, there's no magic number.\n\n92\n00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.550\nI say this to people all the time,\nI say well how big is you get bigger,\n\n93\n00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.590\nhow big is that, what is that number?\n\n94\n00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.360\nIs is 100, is it 500, is it 1,000?\n\n95\n00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.700\nYeah, I think it depends on the size and\nthe geography of the organization.\n\n96\n00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.460\nI think geographical distribution\n\n97\n00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.180\nof resources tends to lead you to have\nto operate as a quote unquote bigger\n\n98\n00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.350\norganization than it does when\nyou're centralized, first of all.\n\n99\n00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.230\nAs you distribute your different\ninformation management capabilities to\n\n100\n00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.760\ndifferent regions,\noffices, geographies, etc.\n\n101\n00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.620\nYou tend to have to scale a lot more\nquickly than you do if you're centralized\n\n102\n00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.515\nin one location,\nI think that there are magic numbers.\n\n103\n00:05:34.515 --> 00:05:39.000\n1,000 or more seats and\nendpoints is usually a tipping point for\n\n104\n00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.260\na lot of these kinds of determinations,\nlicensing,\n\n105\n00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.330\nscalability on enterprise\nplatform management.\n\n106\n00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.360\nIt's just a lot of things that,\nwhen you get up to that level and\n\n107\n00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.110\nbeyond, you start to think of\nin a different way, right?\n\n108\n00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.580\nSo I think it depends but\n\n109\n00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.860\nmy point at the end of the day is,\nwhatever big equals in your world, right?\n\n110\n00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.930\nWhen you get to that inflexion point or\nthat tipping point and\n\n111\n00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.830\nall of a sudden,\nit's not about hey there's one or\n\n112\n00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.620\ntwo people that do this but there's\na team of people that do this, right?\n\n113\n00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.259\nAnd when you have that team and it's\nnot a team of one or an army of one but\n\n114\n00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:12.878\nit's an actual team, right?\n\n115\n00:06:12.878 --> 00:06:16.723\nYou have lots of people,\nwhen you get to that point, that's when we\n\n116\n00:06:16.723 --> 00:06:21.379\nneed start making sure role definition is\nthe primary lead in the documentation,\n\n117\n00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:24.092\nas opposed to person-named responsibility.\n\n118\n00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:27.815\nAnd that's a very subtle, but important\ndistinction that you just need to think\n\n119\n00:06:27.815 --> 00:06:29.850\nabout and make sure you're aware of.\n\n120\n00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:30.910\nSo what are some of these roles?\n\n121\n00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:31.800\nIncident coordinator,\n\n122\n00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.030\nI mentioned that one already,\nwe've given Daniel that responsibility.\n\n123\n00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.390\nIncident manager,\nincident analyst, constituency.\n\n124\n00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:41.360\nHow do we define, we've talked\nabout this in our prior episode,\n\n125\n00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.320\nhow do we define our audience,\nright, our theater of operations?\n\n126\n00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.240\nWe call it con-ops when we talk about\ndesigning and defining in the enterprise\n\n127\n00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.660\nsecurity architecture, our conceptual\nidea or concept of operations.\n\n128\n00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.110\nSo what's the constituency,\nwhat's the audience?\n\n129\n00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:01.490\nAdministration, these are the roles that\ntake care of the paperwork, the blocking\n\n130\n00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.230\nand tackling behind the scenes of how\nto keep the team organized, how do we\n\n131\n00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:09.600\nget the licensing we need, how do we spend\nthe money to acquire talent and software.\n\n132\n00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.400\nAll that kind of stuff's just admin,\n\n133\n00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.040\noversight, HR typically another\nrole that gets called out.\n\n134\n00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.560\nHow do we deal with the person, or\n\n135\n00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.700\nthe human capital and capability and asset\nequation of thinks like public relations,\n\n136\n00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.450\nPR, how do we deal with communication and\nmarketing, messaging?\n\n137\n00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:29.520\nAnd today this is even more important,\n\n138\n00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.150\nwhen you think about the social\nmedia multiplier, right?\n\n139\n00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.412\nThat we often have to\nengage around this today.\n\n140\n00:07:36.412 --> 00:07:41.608\nToday in the modern enterprise It's not\njust about let's control communication and\n\n141\n00:07:41.608 --> 00:07:47.094\nlet's make sure we're tight on email,\nthere's Twitter, there's Skype, there's,\n\n142\n00:07:47.094 --> 00:07:52.164\nI don't know help me out here, what are\nsome of the other social media mechanisms?\n\n143\n00:07:52.164 --> 00:07:52.815\n&gt;&gt; Facebook, LinkedIn [LAUGH].\n\n144\n00:07:52.815 --> 00:07:56.932\n&gt;&gt; Facebook, you're talking to the most\nanti-social media person around.\n\n145\n00:07:56.932 --> 00:08:01.035\nSo LinkedIn, whatever the case may be,\nthere's all these different things.\n\n146\n00:08:01.035 --> 00:08:05.042\nBut I don't want say like Vine and\nstuff like that, it's so yesterday, right?\n\n147\n00:08:05.042 --> 00:08:08.136\nI said, actually I had this conversation,\nI don't know if I told you this.\n\n148\n00:08:08.136 --> 00:08:10.240\nI had this conversation with\none of my older daughter,\n\n149\n00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.190\none of my daughters,\nmy teenager not my tween.\n\n150\n00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:17.960\nAnd we were talking and\nI'm like what are you using to communicate\n\n151\n00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.400\nwith your friends, because I figure\nI'll go right to the source, right,\n\n152\n00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.480\nget the most recent updated information.\n\n153\n00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.880\nAnd I know, at least for a while,\nVine was a really big, hot thing.\n\n154\n00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.160\nShe's like yeah, we don't use Vine\nanymore, that's so yesterday.\n\n155\n00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.839\nI'm like yesterday?\n\n156\n00:08:30.839 --> 00:08:34.468\nYeah, I'm literally we just don't use it\nanymore, we use this other stuff now,\n\n157\n00:08:34.468 --> 00:08:37.340\nSnapchat, Twitter,\nall this other stuff, whatever.\n\n158\n00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:41.400\nAnd I'm like okay, great, so every\nother day there's a new thing, right?\n\n159\n00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:45.500\nAnd that's fine, but the challenge for\nus as IT security administrators and\n\n160\n00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:46.980\nsecurity professionals..\n\n161\n00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:50.940\nAs [INAUDIBLE] handlers is\nare those elements making their way\n\n162\n00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:51.750\ninto the business?\n\n163\n00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:56.530\nAre people using those communication\nstreams to be able to share information?\n\n164\n00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:57.860\nProvide updates?\n\n165\n00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:02.040\nI have virtual incident handling and\nC-Cert teams that I'm involved with\n\n166\n00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:06.960\nthat use not Twitter and necessarily\nVine and things like that, Facebook.\n\n167\n00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.050\nBut they do use electronic secure but\n\n168\n00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:14.160\nelectronic chat communication platforms to\nbe able to send and receive information.\n\n169\n00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.200\nBecause we don't all work\nin the same place, right?\n\n170\n00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.230\nSo something like WhatsApp or\none of those secure\n\n171\n00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:23.390\ncommunication platforms may be used\nto be able to send messages back and\n\n172\n00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:26.860\nforth, because maybe email\nhas been compromised.\n\n173\n00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:31.940\nSo maybe email as a system cannot be\nused as the primary method or maybe\n\n174\n00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:38.150\nthe file sharing solution, SharePoint,\nDropbox, Drop or rather Dropbox Box.\n\n175\n00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:42.570\nWhatever it is SkyDrive,\nwhatever you may use OneDrive now, right?\n\n176\n00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:46.630\nWhatever it is maybe those access points\naren't available because of a denial\n\n177\n00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:50.320\nservice or distributed denial service\nattack against infrastructure.\n\n178\n00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.445\nAnd as a result, you have to\ncome up with a non organization,\n\n179\n00:09:54.445 --> 00:09:58.280\nnon-enterprise based mechanism that's\naltering the communication channel.\n\n180\n00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:02.190\nRight, not a covert channel but\nan alternate communication channel\n\n181\n00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:06.730\nthat is not regulated through the normal\nservice channel, so it's not disrupted.\n\n182\n00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:09.274\nAnd that maybe something as simple\nas picking up a cellphone and\n\n183\n00:10:09.274 --> 00:10:10.429\ncalling somebody, right.\n\n184\n00:10:10.429 --> 00:10:14.072\nBut my point is you have to have\nthat thought process sitting in your\n\n185\n00:10:14.072 --> 00:10:15.839\nmind documented ahead of time.\n\n186\n00:10:15.839 --> 00:10:19.530\nYou have to have the call tree,\nyou have to know what's going on.\n\n187\n00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:22.900\nYou hear all these stories\nall the time about\n\n188\n00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:27.230\npeople that go in incident response\nmode and go to pull the call tree up.\n\n189\n00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:30.685\nAnd they find out the call tree's not\nactive because everybody changed their\n\n190\n00:10:30.685 --> 00:10:33.530\ncellphone numbers and\nyou can't reach anybody, right?\n\n191\n00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:37.570\nOr you hear the stories about the fact\nthat yeah, we store all that documentation\n\n192\n00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:41.650\ncuz we harp on the importance of,\nthe need for documentation.\n\n193\n00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:45.310\nWe beat on that relentlessly and\nrightly, so you have to have it.\n\n194\n00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:48.060\nAnd so we tell you, hey do that,\neverybody goes okay, great,\n\n195\n00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:51.290\nwe'll put it up in SharePoint or\nwherever we put in our ECM,\n\n196\n00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:53.160\nin our enterprise content\nmanagement system.\n\n197\n00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.160\nIt's electronic, we'll put it there,\neverybody can get to it.\n\n198\n00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.110\nWell, that's great until the attack\nagainst the infrastructure you were\n\n199\n00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:02.660\nresponding to happens to be that that\nsystem is part of the casualty list.\n\n200\n00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:06.910\nHow do you get to your instance\ncall list and your team list and\n\n201\n00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:10.860\nyour plan if is sitting in the cloud and\nyou can't get to the cloud?\n\n202\n00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:14.080\nRight, and I tell this to people and\nthey're like well, yeah,\n\n203\n00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.900\nI didn't really think about that.\n\n204\n00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:21.790\nWell okay, that's why you need to step\nback and plan prior to the event.\n\n205\n00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:24.820\nHave an analog hard copy of this.\n\n206\n00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.830\nRight, as crazy as that sounds.\n\n207\n00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:29.780\nI walk around with all\nsorts of stuff on my laptop\n\n208\n00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:32.000\nthat's mirrored to 25 different places.\n\n209\n00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.320\nBut I also have hard copies\nof stuff that are printed out\n\n210\n00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.870\nthat people look at me strangely.\n\n211\n00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:39.430\nI walk in with my little Moleskine book,\nright?\n\n212\n00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:40.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n213\n00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:44.280\n&gt;&gt; I got all my junk and papers and\nstuff crammed in there, right?\n\n214\n00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.710\nBut then when I'm the guy who\neverybody calls and they say well,\n\n215\n00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:49.070\nwe can't get the stuff,\nyou remember what it is.\n\n216\n00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:50.820\nWell yeah,\nI probably have a note on it somewhere.\n\n217\n00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.720\nBecause I know that when you\ncan't get to it electronically,\n\n218\n00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.390\nyou gotta have that backup analog copy.\n\n219\n00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:58.130\nSurprisingly, not so surprisingly, but\n\n220\n00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:01.710\na lot of my clients especially\nin healthcare and finance.\n\n221\n00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:05.130\nHave reverted, started to revert it\nback in the last couple of years\n\n222\n00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:09.260\nto hard copy paper storage for\nspecific kinds of record.\n\n223\n00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:13.180\nAs a fail safe fallback against hey,\neverything is backed up,\n\n224\n00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.970\nit's in the cloud,\nwe're duplicating it, whatever.\n\n225\n00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:19.300\nBut if any or all that stuff is DDossed or\n\n226\n00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:23.550\nDOSed and they can't get to it, they've\ngot to still be able to run the business.\n\n227\n00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:28.990\nAnd as a result, they're actually\ninvesting in secure archival storage,\n\n228\n00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:30.480\ntemperature control long term.\n\n229\n00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.550\nJust dumping a bunch\nof paper in the vault.\n\n230\n00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:36.870\nFor business records for instance, you\ngotta hold them for seven years by law.\n\n231\n00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:41.000\nAnd ten years in Germany by law\nbased on the way the German law is.\n\n232\n00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.110\nAnd a lot of my customers are starting\nto actually put that stuff back.\n\n233\n00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:48.690\nMicrofiche, all that kind of stuff\nthat we would know about in theory for\n\n234\n00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:50.090\nyears gone by.\n\n235\n00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:53.720\nSome of you may not have a clue what I\njust said with microfiche, microfilm.\n\n236\n00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.980\n&gt;&gt; Those things were awesome.\n\n237\n00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, those readers were cool, right?\n\n238\n00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:59.050\nA little like one by one,\ntwo by two square,\n\n239\n00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:00.480\nyou have the entire New York Times, right.\n\n240\n00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.900\nI mean it was just really cool.\n\n241\n00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.320\nAnd you can actually still get\nthis technology and use it.\n\n242\n00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.475\nI have a lot of customers that\nare reverting back to this stuff.\n\n243\n00:13:07.475 --> 00:13:10.147\nSo, it's interesting when you\nstart to think about this, right.\n\n244\n00:13:10.147 --> 00:13:11.640\n&gt;&gt; All things old are new again, right.\n\n245\n00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.520\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think it's not so\nmuch things old are new again.\n\n246\n00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.080\nI think that certainly part of it, but\n\n247\n00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.720\nI think it's also things that\nactually work well, right.\n\n248\n00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:25.870\nAnd are proven time-tested,\nthat technology may have advanced past.\n\n249\n00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:29.100\nBut the reality is that\nbaseline technology that is\n\n250\n00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.050\na little bit more person intensive, right.\n\n251\n00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:34.390\nIt requires a little more effort and\ntime use, not as automated,\n\n252\n00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:39.310\nnot as just hit the button, sit back and\nwait for it to happen kind of technology.\n\n253\n00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:43.430\nBut we're finding more and\nmore that because these attacks can be so\n\n254\n00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:47.180\ndevastating and so\npervasive in terms of the coverage.\n\n255\n00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:50.400\nThat we may not have the opportunity\nto get into the cloud or\n\n256\n00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:54.880\nget stuff out of the cloud as a result or\nthe fallout of this attack.\n\n257\n00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:58.750\nIf they being the bad actors,\nthe threat source, right?\n\n258\n00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:02.000\nIf they set off the proverbial\nnuclear bomb, right?\n\n259\n00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.800\nThe fallout's gonna touch everything for\na 40 mile radius.\n\n260\n00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.330\nIf you're inside that blast zone,\n\n261\n00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:11.010\nyou better have an alternate plan\nbecause you're done otherwise, right?\n\n262\n00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:12.230\nI mean it's just the way it is.\n\n263\n00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:14.970\nSo we need to be thinking\nas security professionals,\n\n264\n00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:17.880\nas IT professionals, as incident handlers.\n\n265\n00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.730\nWe need to be thinking outside\nof the technology box.\n\n266\n00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:25.170\nThis is one of the most important\nconversations, important lessons that\n\n267\n00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:28.920\nI talk about and I impart to my customers\nand my students on a regular basis.\n\n268\n00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.300\nIf you can't get beyond the boundaries and\n\n269\n00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.690\nlimitations of your current\ntechnology platform.\n\n270\n00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:36.820\nYou don't know how to operate\nwithout that technology,\n\n271\n00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.640\nwhat are you gonna do when\nit's unavailable, right.\n\n272\n00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:44.650\nI remember when I went to\nqualify as a VM more certified\n\n273\n00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:48.610\ninstructors at VCI and I went through\nthe whole boot camp thing you gotta do.\n\n274\n00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:50.413\nIt's a very involved process,\n\n275\n00:14:50.413 --> 00:14:54.099\nbut one of the things that I actually\nhad to do that they made me do.\n\n276\n00:14:54.099 --> 00:14:58.247\nAnd this varies for everybody, but\nin my interviews and my train back and\n\n277\n00:14:58.247 --> 00:15:02.230\nall that kind of stuff,\nat a certain point you've seen me teach.\n\n278\n00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:05.270\nI wander around and\nI do all sorts of crazy stuff normally.\n\n279\n00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:09.260\nI'm actually anchored in concrete to the\nplatform I'm standing in front of here.\n\n280\n00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.520\nThey've shackled me to the console so\nI can't move.\n\n281\n00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.929\n&gt;&gt; Some ski boots that we've\nanchored into the floor [CROSSTALK].\n\n282\n00:15:13.929 --> 00:15:14.776\n&gt;&gt; Actually, I've got gravity boots on.\n\n283\n00:15:14.776 --> 00:15:16.144\nBut normally I'd be wandering around.\n\n284\n00:15:16.144 --> 00:15:18.701\nIf this was me teaching in a classroom,\n\n285\n00:15:18.701 --> 00:15:22.222\nI would not be standing in\nany one place for very long.\n\n286\n00:15:22.222 --> 00:15:26.380\nBut you seeing me teach and knowing that.\n\n287\n00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.950\nThe two guys I had to\nteach back to from VMware.\n\n288\n00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:32.840\nAt one point they pulled me aside and\nsaid okay, listen, here's the deal.\n\n289\n00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:36.710\nFor this next upcoming teach,\nright, you've got no resources.\n\n290\n00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:38.360\nYour computers broken.\n\n291\n00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.730\nYou've got no Internet.\n\n292\n00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:45.660\nYou've got no anything other\nthan two pens and a flip chart.\n\n293\n00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:48.600\nThey brought it in the room, put it in\nthe corner and said okay, here's the deal.\n\n294\n00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:52.891\nBasically, you're teaching the section\non distributed switches and\n\n295\n00:15:52.891 --> 00:15:55.115\nyou can do nothing but essentially.\n\n296\n00:15:55.115 --> 00:15:56.390\nAnd by the way, you cannot move.\n\n297\n00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:57.155\nThat was the other thing.\n\n298\n00:15:57.155 --> 00:16:00.373\nThey're like you're gonna go stand over\nthere in the corner by the chart, And\n\n299\n00:16:00.373 --> 00:16:03.170\nthat's the only, you have like\na two foot radius around the chart.\n\n300\n00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:04.706\nSo you can move around and draw, right?\n\n301\n00:16:04.706 --> 00:16:06.148\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But basically you could be in front of\n\n302\n00:16:06.148 --> 00:16:07.260\nthe chart talking and drawing.\n\n303\n00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.090\nYou cannot move and\nyou could only use the chart and\n\n304\n00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:11.730\nthe two color markers we gave you.\n\n305\n00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:13.556\nAnd by the way, good luck.\n\n306\n00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:16.693\nAnd you got 30 minutes,\ncuz it's tightly timed,\n\n307\n00:16:16.693 --> 00:16:20.696\nyou gotta finish if the episode or\nthe, not the episode we're at.\n\n308\n00:16:20.696 --> 00:16:26.470\nThe module, the information you're\nteaching is slated at 30 minutes.\n\n309\n00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:30.024\nYou gotta come in anywhere between 29 and\n31.\n\n310\n00:16:30.024 --> 00:16:33.050\nThey give you a minute or two variable or\neither side to end early or\n\n311\n00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:34.680\nbe over a little bit based on Q&amp;A.\n\n312\n00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.850\nSo you have to number one,\nmanage your time.\n\n313\n00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:38.810\nNumber two, you have to use\nwhatever the resources are.\n\n314\n00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:41.750\nBecause they said, look, what happens\nif you show up at a client site, or\n\n315\n00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:44.340\nyou're in class, the projector breaks.\n\n316\n00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:47.130\nAnd your computer for\nwhatever reason is just not working,\n\n317\n00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:48.040\ncan't get to the Internet.\n\n318\n00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.510\nWhat are you gonna do, right?\n\n319\n00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:54.589\nSo, and it's a perfectly valid point and\nas a trainer, I constantly, and\n\n320\n00:16:54.589 --> 00:16:59.609\nthis is what I've done for over 30\nyears as a teacher, as a consultant.\n\n321\n00:16:59.609 --> 00:17:03.730\nI show up on site and I've taught in\nsome pretty crazy places over the years.\n\n322\n00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:08.059\nI mean, you're one step removed from\na grass shack on the beach kind of thing.\n\n323\n00:17:08.059 --> 00:17:10.847\nAnd every plan I had, I had resource,\nI had this, I had that,\n\n324\n00:17:10.847 --> 00:17:12.410\nnone of it's working.\n\n325\n00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:14.200\nAnd I still gotta be able to stand up and\n\n326\n00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.890\nexplain to customers and\nstudents what I'm doing.\n\n327\n00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:18.950\nI can't just throw the towel and\nsay, okay, guess what?\n\n328\n00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:20.380\nI'll come back when you have Internet,\nright?\n\n329\n00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:22.110\nCall me when things get better.\n\n330\n00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:23.880\nSo you've got to always be prepared.\n\n331\n00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.230\nAnd the Boy Scout motto, right?\n\n332\n00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:26.380\nAlways be prepared.\n\n333\n00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:29.390\nIf you operate that way\nas an incident handler,\n\n334\n00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:31.600\nthen this is the thing\nyou gotta think about.\n\n335\n00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.523\nBecause when the five things on\nthe list ahead of the last option fail,\n\n336\n00:17:35.523 --> 00:17:37.795\nit's time for the last option, right?\n\n337\n00:17:37.795 --> 00:17:39.250\nAnd you got to make sure it's ready.\n\n338\n00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:42.562\nSo incident coordinator,\nincident manager, incident analyst,\n\n339\n00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:45.414\nconstituency administration,\nHR, public relations.\n\n340\n00:17:45.414 --> 00:17:50.810\nThese are all roles that are typically\nfound on most incident response teams.\n\n341\n00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:52.140\nMake sure you're familiar with them.\n\n342\n00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.494\nWhat kind of services does the provide?\n\n343\n00:17:54.494 --> 00:17:58.197\nThis is also important, we have three\ncategories, right, we tend to think about.\n\n344\n00:17:58.197 --> 00:18:01.380\nWe have reactive services,\ntalked a lot about this already.\n\n345\n00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.390\nWe have proactive services and\n\n346\n00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:08.430\nwe have also quality management or\nquality of service, QoS-related oversight.\n\n347\n00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:12.655\nAnd quality assurance and\nquality assessment kind of services.\n\n348\n00:18:12.655 --> 00:18:14.899\nLet me give you some examples of\neach kind of category here, right?\n\n349\n00:18:14.899 --> 00:18:18.761\nWhen we're thinking of reactive, we're\nthinking about things that may fall in\n\n350\n00:18:18.761 --> 00:18:21.616\nthe categories of incident handling,\nalerting, right?\n\n351\n00:18:21.616 --> 00:18:24.200\nThese are traditional reactive services.\n\n352\n00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.710\nAfter the fact, something has happened.\n\n353\n00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:29.790\nLet's tell you what's going on and\ngive you the opportunity to respond.\n\n354\n00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:33.460\nThat's what reactive\ncategorized services may be.\n\n355\n00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:35.335\nWhat about proactive?\n\n356\n00:18:35.335 --> 00:18:39.030\nTrying to do things ahead of time and\neither change, modify, or\n\n357\n00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:42.320\nsomehow impact the incidents\nthat have not occurred yet.\n\n358\n00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.266\nSo we can minimize, mitigate,\nthe impact, or perhaps,\n\n359\n00:18:45.266 --> 00:18:47.683\nzero them out,\nif we're lucky enough to do so.\n\n360\n00:18:47.683 --> 00:18:49.633\nWhat are things that may occur there?\n\n361\n00:18:49.633 --> 00:18:50.569\nThings like auditing,\n\n362\n00:18:50.569 --> 00:18:53.674\nyou've heard me talk about auditing in\nsome of my prior discussions with you.\n\n363\n00:18:53.674 --> 00:18:57.989\nSystems, like an IDS, an intrusion\ndetection system, would be good example of\n\n364\n00:18:57.989 --> 00:19:02.480\nproactive capabilities and services\nthat we may provide and/or put in place.\n\n365\n00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:06.116\nThat would allow us to be able to try\nto get ahead of the curve, right,\n\n366\n00:19:06.116 --> 00:19:08.709\nin theory and\nto be able to do that successfully.\n\n367\n00:19:08.709 --> 00:19:12.240\nWhat about quality management,\nquality of service, QS kind of stuff?\n\n368\n00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.900\nThings like risk analysis\nwould fall into this category.\n\n369\n00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:18.240\nBusiness continuity, disaster recovery\nplanning fall into this category.\n\n370\n00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:22.040\nWe're trying to take a baseline,\nmodify that as necessary.\n\n371\n00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:25.258\nIntuitively assess that to ensure\nit's aligned going forward.\n\n372\n00:19:25.258 --> 00:19:27.858\nAnd we're applying that and as a result,\n\n373\n00:19:27.858 --> 00:19:31.320\ntrying to raise the bar on\nthe quality of what we do.\n\n374\n00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.640\nAnd minimize the impact of the incident.\n\n375\n00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.950\nYou may make the argument that\nsomething like a BCDR plan or\n\n376\n00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:39.340\na risk analysis solution.\n\n377\n00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.870\nCould, in theory,\nfall under the category of proactivity.\n\n378\n00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:45.120\nAnd I wouldn't necessarily argue with you.\n\n379\n00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:50.200\nBut the distinction we make is that\nproactive activities, proactive services.\n\n380\n00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:54.890\nAre done in order to assess\nwhere we currently are.\n\n381\n00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:58.760\nAnd, again,\nto minimize the impact of known risks or\n\n382\n00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.861\nknown threats, known vulnerabilities.\n\n383\n00:20:01.861 --> 00:20:05.311\nQuality management, quality of\nservice kind of stuff is done, again,\n\n384\n00:20:05.311 --> 00:20:07.750\nin an ongoing way,\ntypically scheduled, right?\n\n385\n00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:12.830\nBut we're doing it so that we can\nensure that if something does go wrong.\n\n386\n00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:16.594\nWe can recover and that we can\nminimize the impact of that and\n\n387\n00:20:16.594 --> 00:20:20.521\ntry to prevent it from occurring as well,\nif at all possible.\n\n388\n00:20:20.521 --> 00:20:23.430\nSo I wanna make sure we're thinking\nabout those different services.\n\n389\n00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:27.600\nWe talked a lot about policy and why\npolicy is so important in the business.\n\n390\n00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.181\nRemember policy at a high level,\n\n391\n00:20:30.181 --> 00:20:35.906\na general statement of intent answers\ntwo main questions, why and what.\n\n392\n00:20:35.906 --> 00:20:38.260\nComing from senior management,\nstakeholders,\n\n393\n00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:40.230\nsenior thought leaders in the business.\n\n394\n00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:42.449\nDifferent ways of referring to them,\nthose people,\n\n395\n00:20:42.449 --> 00:20:44.139\nit's always a good one as well, right?\n\n396\n00:20:44.139 --> 00:20:47.185\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; C-suite, whatever it may be, but\n\n397\n00:20:47.185 --> 00:20:50.190\nwe're answering the strategic imperative,\nright?\n\n398\n00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:54.066\nWe're thinking about, from a strategy\nperspective, root cause, why?\n\n399\n00:20:54.066 --> 00:20:56.606\nAnd laying out the high level what,\n\n400\n00:20:56.606 --> 00:21:01.017\nthe high level road map of what\nwe're looking to accomplish.\n\n401\n00:21:01.017 --> 00:21:06.005\nAnd then the procedure and the process\nthat is defined as a distilled result of\n\n402\n00:21:06.005 --> 00:21:11.394\nthe policy, will further iterate down,\nwill further kinda peel back the layers.\n\n403\n00:21:11.394 --> 00:21:16.118\nAnd go from this very high level, down to\nground level where we execute tactically,\n\n404\n00:21:16.118 --> 00:21:17.391\nright, step by step.\n\n405\n00:21:17.391 --> 00:21:20.301\nSo policy is seen as being strategic.\n\n406\n00:21:20.301 --> 00:21:26.901\nProcess is seen as being operational and\nthen procedure is seen as being tactical.\n\n407\n00:21:26.901 --> 00:21:30.720\nThree very important concepts and\nframing terms we wanna think about.\n\n408\n00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:33.530\nIf policy is strategic,\nit's very high level, right?\n\n409\n00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:36.710\nIt's not gonna tell you,\ngo there, open that cabinet,\n\n410\n00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:39.590\nlog on with this credential,\npush this button.\n\n411\n00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:44.360\nWait for output, when it says successful,\nclose window, right, repeat as needed.\n\n412\n00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.744\nThat's a procedure, right?\n\n413\n00:21:46.744 --> 00:21:49.363\nThat is something that's a procedure,\nright?\n\n414\n00:21:49.363 --> 00:21:52.249\nThat's step-by-step,\nthat's very tactical, right?\n\n415\n00:21:52.249 --> 00:21:54.564\nSo the taking of the strategy and\n\n416\n00:21:54.564 --> 00:22:00.500\nthe distilling it into a managerial\noversight framework is the process, right?\n\n417\n00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:05.505\nWrite the process up and then the\nprocedure that implements that process and\n\n418\n00:22:05.505 --> 00:22:10.080\nis auditable, verifiable, and\nis defined and repeated as needed.\n\n419\n00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:15.170\nAnd executed by some sort of practitioner,\nfront line person, that's very tactical.\n\n420\n00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:17.880\nSo we have three distinct\nareas we focus on.\n\n421\n00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:19.600\nBut the policy is very important, right?\n\n422\n00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:25.069\nBecause the policy helps us to understand\nand helps us to communicate broadly what\n\n423\n00:22:25.069 --> 00:22:30.475\nthe intent and the focus needs to be for\neverybody involved in these activities.\n\n424\n00:22:30.475 --> 00:22:31.597\nThe reasons why we do it and\n\n425\n00:22:31.597 --> 00:22:34.950\nwhat we're looking to accomplish\nare what we're looking for here.\n\n426\n00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:39.100\nSo when we think of policy, we think of\npolicy being made up traditionally of four\n\n427\n00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:42.320\ndistinct areas or contributing\nfactors that we wanna think about.\n\n428\n00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:46.620\nWe think of attributes,\ncontent validation, and\n\n429\n00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:49.250\nwe think of also implementation,\nmaintenance, and enforcement, right?\n\n430\n00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:52.493\nSo when we think about attributes,\nwe're thinking about\n\n431\n00:22:52.493 --> 00:22:56.008\nthings like managerial approval and\nusability of the policy.\n\n432\n00:22:56.008 --> 00:22:59.940\nThese are attributes or things that\nwe would look at, we would measure,\n\n433\n00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:01.883\nwe would assess, we would verify.\n\n434\n00:23:01.883 --> 00:23:03.883\nAnd remember,\nwe've stressed time and again,\n\n435\n00:23:03.883 --> 00:23:06.287\nif you don't have senior\nmanagement approval and buy in.\n\n436\n00:23:06.287 --> 00:23:09.075\nYou've got no ability to go forward,\nno right,\n\n437\n00:23:09.075 --> 00:23:11.523\nno consent on behalf\nof the organization or\n\n438\n00:23:11.523 --> 00:23:15.580\nenterprise to engage in the activities\nthat you are engaging in.\n\n439\n00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:17.240\nYou may be doing something\nthat's valuable.\n\n440\n00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.410\nYou may be doing something\nthat's absolutely correct.\n\n441\n00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:23.390\nBut you are not doing something that\nhas been authorized to be done and\n\n442\n00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:27.050\nhas been given the green light by\nthe decision makers who have to approve it\n\n443\n00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:27.970\nin order to validate it.\n\n444\n00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:29.460\nSo that's a very important thing.\n\n445\n00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:33.210\nSo attributes like management approval and\nusability would be examples.\n\n446\n00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:35.280\nContent, what are examples of this?\n\n447\n00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:38.310\nThings like role identification,\nso who's in what role,\n\n448\n00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:40.870\nwhat role is gonna be defined this wave?\n\n449\n00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:42.210\nWe've talked about this.\n\n450\n00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:44.930\nGlossary of terms,\nwhat's the language we're gonna use and\n\n451\n00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:49.360\ntalk about in the framing of the policy\nand with regards to implementation.\n\n452\n00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:52.030\nSo these kinds of things would\nfall into the content bucket.\n\n453\n00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:53.220\nWhat about validation?\n\n454\n00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:56.920\nRight, classic example of validation\ncontrol would be use cases, right?\n\n455\n00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:00.755\nHow do we go through and actually\nfigure out the what if scenarios or\n\n456\n00:24:00.755 --> 00:24:04.396\nthe Operational environments\nthat this policy will address.\n\n457\n00:24:04.396 --> 00:24:05.922\nWe come up with use cases, and\n\n458\n00:24:05.922 --> 00:24:09.850\nthen we validate them against the policy\nto ensure that they make sense.\n\n459\n00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:12.260\nWhat about implementation,\nmaintenance, and enforcement?\n\n460\n00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:14.479\nHow do we deal with those\naspects of policies?\n\n461\n00:24:14.479 --> 00:24:16.907\nThings like feedback loops,\n\n462\n00:24:16.907 --> 00:24:22.061\nhow do we iterate through a lessons\nlearned post event review?\n\n463\n00:24:22.061 --> 00:24:22.803\nA post mortem.\n\n464\n00:24:22.803 --> 00:24:27.232\nA iterative feedback loop of some\nkind that allows us to do CSI,\n\n465\n00:24:27.232 --> 00:24:32.917\ncontinual service improvement, where we\npush back feedback into the system and\n\n466\n00:24:32.917 --> 00:24:36.111\nadjust as needed ongoing to refine, right?\n\n467\n00:24:36.111 --> 00:24:39.429\nThis is what a traditional thought\nprocess would be around that.\n\n468\n00:24:39.429 --> 00:24:42.549\nAnd that's something that we just want to\nmake sure we're aware of that we think\n\n469\n00:24:42.549 --> 00:24:43.256\nabout, as well.\n\n470\n00:24:43.256 --> 00:24:47.666\nSo understanding the four contributory\nfactors, the four things that make us, or\n\n471\n00:24:47.666 --> 00:24:50.753\nhelp us to make up policy and\nframe it would be a good idea and\n\n472\n00:24:50.753 --> 00:24:54.667\nsomething that I would definitely\nspend some time focusing on, as well.\n\n473\n00:24:54.667 --> 00:24:58.120\nWhat's typical Case looked like\nfrom a C-Cert perspective, right?\n\n474\n00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:02.935\nWe think about case management and what a\nC-Cert does and how we may deal with that.\n\n475\n00:25:02.935 --> 00:25:04.082\nWhat does that look like?\n\n476\n00:25:04.082 --> 00:25:07.354\nWell typically,\nwe've got six distinct areas or steps or\n\n477\n00:25:07.354 --> 00:25:09.152\nideas that we would focus on.\n\n478\n00:25:09.152 --> 00:25:12.117\nWe would want to keep a log of everything\nwe do that's a whole documentation thing\n\n479\n00:25:12.117 --> 00:25:13.482\nthat we keep coming back to, right?\n\n480\n00:25:13.482 --> 00:25:15.359\nHave that on going dialogue and\n\n481\n00:25:15.359 --> 00:25:19.335\nthe information management\ncapability to keep track of things.\n\n482\n00:25:19.335 --> 00:25:22.662\nInform the appropriate people\nwhen you've opened up a case.\n\n483\n00:25:22.662 --> 00:25:25.032\nWho are the parties of interest,\nas we would say?\n\n484\n00:25:25.032 --> 00:25:27.587\nWho are the line of business owners,\nas we talked about?\n\n485\n00:25:27.587 --> 00:25:31.053\nWho are the members of the constituency\nthat have to be informed to use\n\n486\n00:25:31.053 --> 00:25:33.690\nthe language that we've\nbeen talking about.\n\n487\n00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:36.373\nMaintain a list of contacts,\nwe talked about how important that is.\n\n488\n00:25:36.373 --> 00:25:38.872\nUnderstand the org charts of the business.\n\n489\n00:25:38.872 --> 00:25:42.600\nAnd remember, it's about role first and\nthen person second, right?\n\n490\n00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:47.069\nWe keep coming back to that idea, because\nthere's maybe more than one person that\n\n491\n00:25:47.069 --> 00:25:51.370\ninhabits a role and there maybe more\nthan one role assigned to one person.\n\n492\n00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:53.837\nAnd you wanna understand how to deal\nwith those variances as needed.\n\n493\n00:25:53.837 --> 00:25:57.722\nRelease information when appropriate and\nto the appropriate parties,\n\n494\n00:25:57.722 --> 00:26:01.090\nthrough the appropriate and\nauthorized channels.\n\n495\n00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:04.110\nFollow up analysis, so you're gonna go\nback, obviously examine everything.\n\n496\n00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:06.680\nMake sure we understand and\ncan tell a compelling story.\n\n497\n00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.620\nAnd then finally, summarize all that.\n\n498\n00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:13.270\nGenerate a report, we said reporting's\nalways the last step we engage in.\n\n499\n00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:16.700\nTraditionally, wanna make sure we're\naware of that and understand that, and\n\n500\n00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:22.180\nensure that we are able to not only tell\na compelling story to the stakeholders and\n\n501\n00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:26.860\nto the people and the Members\nof the constituency by role and\n\n502\n00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:30.550\nby area in the business or\nthe organization, the need to be informed.\n\n503\n00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:34.780\nBut remember, we may be sharing this\ninformation more broadly, maybe sharing it\n\n504\n00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:38.920\noutside the organization with law\nenforcement, with vendors, with partners.\n\n505\n00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:43.650\nAnd this is something that has to be\ndone in order to perhaps meet a legal or\n\n506\n00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:47.860\nregulatory obligation, but it may also\nhave to be done because we have to inform\n\n507\n00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:51.630\nthem of risks that have been\nintroduced into our business.\n\n508\n00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:56.240\nBut because of a lateral relationship,\neither a federation or a supply chain\n\n509\n00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:01.660\ndependency, we may now be introducing risk\nor propagating risk into their world.\n\n510\n00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:05.180\nAnd we need to make sure we inform them\nof that, it's very, very important.\n\n511\n00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:08.000\nTalked about the importance\nin this documentation\n\n512\n00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.240\nin several of our discussions\nin prior episodes.\n\n513\n00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:14.050\nTook you out to the NIST website,\nshowed you the distinction between SP 800,\n\n514\n00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:18.430\nSP 1,500, et cetera, all the different\ncategories, the documentation.\n\n515\n00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:21.430\nShowed you a couple of\ndocuments would be valuable.\n\n516\n00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:24.790\nOne of them was the NIST document\nof supply chain risk management.\n\n517\n00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:26.890\nAnother one was\nthe incident handler guide.\n\n518\n00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:31.355\nWanna remind you of those, just because\nthey are important in many, many areas,\n\n519\n00:27:31.355 --> 00:27:35.058\nbut especially here,\nas we're talking about incident handling.\n\n520\n00:27:35.058 --> 00:27:37.310\nAnd I made this point when we\ntalked about it the first time.\n\n521\n00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:38.869\nRisk management, in general,\n\n522\n00:27:38.869 --> 00:27:42.288\nis an incredibly important topic\nwith regards to incident handling.\n\n523\n00:27:42.288 --> 00:27:45.523\nBut supply chain risk and\nawareness of supply chain risk,\n\n524\n00:27:45.523 --> 00:27:50.080\nboth up Streaming downstream in the supply\nchain depending on where you are in that\n\n525\n00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:52.990\nrelationship by vendor and\nby dependency web.\n\n526\n00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:56.302\nBecause you may be a vendor\nthat pushes information and\n\n527\n00:27:56.302 --> 00:27:58.320\npushes services down to others.\n\n528\n00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.728\nBut you may also be consuming from\nsomebody above you in a supply chain\n\n529\n00:28:01.728 --> 00:28:03.250\nrelationship, right?\n\n530\n00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:06.430\nSo you may have upstream providers,\nin other words, in vendors, and\n\n531\n00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:09.330\nyou may have downstream\npeople that depend on you.\n\n532\n00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:11.420\nWhen we look at risk in that relationship,\n\n533\n00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:15.490\nwe have to understand where we are and\nreport risk up and down the chain\n\n534\n00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:19.240\nin the appropriate fashion to ensure\nthat everybody is being proactive.\n\n535\n00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:22.730\nBut if they have to be reactive that\nthey're reacting to the right risks and\n\n536\n00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:25.480\nthe right threats that have been\nidentified because of vulnerabilities.\n\n537\n00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.760\nThis becomes very important\nwhen your primary ISP or\n\n538\n00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:32.660\nprimary internet service provider or\nCSP cloud service provider,\n\n539\n00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:37.040\nwhen they go offline or there's\nsomething wrong and they have an outage.\n\n540\n00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.620\nThey usually will notify you, right?\n\n541\n00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:40.530\nWell, you may log on and\nfind out they're offline.\n\n542\n00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:42.550\nUsually you'll get a notification.\n\n543\n00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:47.090\nIf they violate their SLA terms and as a\nresult there maybe some sort of financial\n\n544\n00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:50.400\npenalty due to service outage, you'll\ndefinitely get communication from them,\n\n545\n00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:53.480\nmaybe after the fact, but\nwe'll get communication from them.\n\n546\n00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.580\nAnd they'll work with you to\nfigure out what that looks like.\n\n547\n00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:59.350\nWe're gonna give you a credit of so much\non your bill or whatever it is, right?\n\n548\n00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:02.897\nThat's an example of supply\nchain risk being propagated and\n\n549\n00:29:02.897 --> 00:29:06.167\ncommunication around that\nbeing addressed downstream\n\n550\n00:29:06.167 --> 00:29:09.449\nfrom the primary vendor to\nyou as the customer, right?\n\n551\n00:29:09.449 --> 00:29:11.000\nSo this is the kind of\nthing we're talking about.\n\n552\n00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.802\nSo wanna make sure we're aware of this and\nwe think about this,\n\n553\n00:29:14.802 --> 00:29:20.130\nbecause It's one of the key vocal points\nthat we have to consider and handlers.\n\n554\n00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:24.485\nIt's not just our risk, in other words,\nthat we're managing in the business,\n\n555\n00:29:24.485 --> 00:29:28.714\nit's all the partners and vendors that\nwe partner and consume with through and\n\n556\n00:29:28.714 --> 00:29:31.363\nas a result of that we have\nto at least be aware of.\n\n557\n00:29:31.363 --> 00:29:33.279\nWe're not directly online or\n\n558\n00:29:33.279 --> 00:29:37.840\ndirectly rather on the hook to\nmanage their risk on their behalf.\n\n559\n00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.530\nBut we have to hold them accountable and\n\n560\n00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:42.390\nensure that they're managing their\nrisk to the best of their abilities.\n\n561\n00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:46.080\nAnd if we're smart, we negotiate\nthis into our contracts with them,\n\n562\n00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.490\nthat risk management needs\nto be done a certain way.\n\n563\n00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:51.790\nCommunication has to be set up and\nestablished and reactive and or\n\n564\n00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:55.920\nproactive channels have to be used\nas necessary to keep us in the loop.\n\n565\n00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:59.640\nAnd if we're not doing that, shame on\nus for not thinking about that, and\n\n566\n00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:02.100\nunderstanding the importance\nof it as incident handlers.\n\n567\n00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:04.520\nBut it's a great opportunity\nto go back to the business,\n\n568\n00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:08.840\nand reinvigorate that thought process,\nand create a change that will be\n\n569\n00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:12.580\nincredibly impactful going forward the\nnext time you'd negotiate these contracts.\n\n570\n00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:13.920\nWe can do RFPs.\n\n571\n00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:19.510\nRFQ's and you do RFI's, a request for\nproposals, questions, information, etc.\n\n572\n00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:22.300\nYou walk through that contracting process.\n\n573\n00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:26.330\nYou should be incorporating for\nyour vendors that are submitting to you,\n\n574\n00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:29.350\nmeet these proposals,\na questionnaire about risk management,\n\n575\n00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:31.900\nrisk assessment, and\nhow they handle incident management.\n\n576\n00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:34.769\nAnd if you're not getting that information\nfrom them, shame on you, right?\n\n577\n00:30:34.769 --> 00:30:37.870\nThere's just no good reason for\nyou not to be doing that today.\n\n578\n00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:40.390\nIt's a very, very critical element\nof what we're talking about and\n\n579\n00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:41.266\nwhat we are doing here.\n\n580\n00:30:41.266 --> 00:30:44.090\nAt least,\nattempting to show you how to do here.\n\n581\n00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:48.843\nBecomes very, very timely, because\ncustomers and companies that are not\n\n582\n00:30:48.843 --> 00:30:53.905\nasking for this information are getting\na lot of rude surprises after the fact.\n\n583\n00:30:53.905 --> 00:30:57.750\nWhen they find out the companies\nare dealing with, don't have viable\n\n584\n00:30:57.750 --> 00:31:02.259\nincident handling or risk assessment,\nrisk management capabilities in place.\n\n585\n00:31:02.259 --> 00:31:05.615\nAnd as a result, they're opening\nthemselves up to liability and risk,\n\n586\n00:31:05.615 --> 00:31:08.320\nwhich is now essentially\nbecoming a shared risk, right?\n\n587\n00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.320\nAnd this becomes a very\nbig concern of ours.\n\n588\n00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:13.200\nSo, just some things to think about and\nconsider.\n\n589\n00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.587\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely a lot of\ninformation that we have to take in.\n\n590\n00:31:15.587 --> 00:31:19.859\nYou don't want to, like Adam's been\neluding to, just try to figure out as you\n\n591\n00:31:19.859 --> 00:31:23.620\ngo, use these methodical systems\nthat have been developed.\n\n592\n00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:26.770\nPeople have looked at this from\na logical standpoint and go,\n\n593\n00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:29.194\nwhat would be the next\nprogression from here?\n\n594\n00:31:29.194 --> 00:31:32.082\nHow can we cover ourselves,\nmake a contingency,\n\n595\n00:31:32.082 --> 00:31:35.100\nmake a contingency for our contingencies?\n\n596\n00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:36.530\nThings of that nature.\n\n597\n00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:39.900\nIt's really the business that we're in,\nit's trying to make sure\n\n598\n00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:42.010\nthat we cover all of our basis that\nwe have, all our ducks in a row, so\n\n599\n00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:46.600\nthat when it comes time to actually\npresenting this information to someone\n\n600\n00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:51.600\nas a viable solution or that there's a\nproblem, you can lay that out in a logical\n\n601\n00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:55.140\nway that they can understand, and\nthen we can attack that problem.\n\n602\n00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:58.420\nThat being said, Adam I know you\ngot a little bit more to go, but\n\n603\n00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:00.800\nwe're a little bit out of time [LAUGH] for\nthis episode.\n\n604\n00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:03.190\nSo looks like we'll roll into a Part 3 for\nthat.\n\n605\n00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:06.450\nWe do thank you for joining us today,\nand we thank you guys for watching.\n\n606\n00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:09.741\nBut, signing off for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n607\n00:32:09.741 --> 00:32:10.620\n&gt;&gt; I'm an unqualified

00:00:08.417\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.417 --> 00:00:10.999\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:12.322\n[MUSIC]\n\n6\n00:00:12.322 --> 00:00:13.966\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n7\n00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:17.104\nAnd welcome to another\nexciting episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n8\n00:00:17.104 --> 00:00:19.163\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n9\n00:00:19.163 --> 00:00:23.100\nin today's episode we are back\nwith more on our ECIH series.\n\n10\n00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.775\nAnd, of course, joining us in the studio,\nyet again, one more time, our good friend,\n\n11\n00:00:26.775 --> 00:00:27.567\nMr. Adam Gordon.\n\n12\n00:00:27.567 --> 00:00:29.410\nAdam, welcome back sir, how it goes it?\n\n13\n00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.770\n&gt;&gt; Good for the last time, apparently,\naccording to what you just said, so\n\n14\n00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:34.910\nI'm out of here.\n\n15\n00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.310\nOnly kidding, it's going very well.\n\n16\n00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.490\nWe're gonna continue our conversations.\n\n17\n00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.450\nWe're gonna round out our\nconversation about CSIRTs and SIRTs.\n\n18\n00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.944\nAnd also, if you remember,\nCerts is the mint.\n\n19\n00:00:46.944 --> 00:00:47.912\n&gt;&gt; I do, of course.\n\n20\n00:00:47.912 --> 00:00:49.206\n&gt;&gt; They're not around anymore, are they?\n\n21\n00:00:49.206 --> 00:00:50.340\n&gt;&gt; I think they are.\n&gt;&gt; I haven't seen them in years, are they?\n\n22\n00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.946\n&gt;&gt; I think they're still around,\nthey're just not as popular.\n\n23\n00:00:51.946 --> 00:00:54.117\n&gt;&gt; Altoids just came in and\ntook over that market.\n\n24\n00:00:54.117 --> 00:00:54.893\n&gt;&gt; They tend to do that.\n\n25\n00:00:54.893 --> 00:00:56.955\n&gt;&gt; And between them and\nMentos they just killed.\n\n26\n00:00:56.955 --> 00:00:57.645\n&gt;&gt; They're monsters.\n\n27\n00:00:57.645 --> 00:00:59.075\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just, I don't know.\n\n28\n00:00:59.075 --> 00:01:00.655\nAnyway, good times.\n\n29\n00:01:00.655 --> 00:01:03.525\nGood times with the old school\nthought processor on mints.\n\n30\n00:01:03.525 --> 00:01:06.276\nWe'll talk about SIRTs and\nwhat they are as well,\n\n31\n00:01:06.276 --> 00:01:09.631\nthe way in which we differentiate\nbetween CSIRTs and SIRTs.\n\n32\n00:01:09.631 --> 00:01:13.075\nAnd we'll get through all that, but\nwhat I wanted to started out with and\n\n33\n00:01:13.075 --> 00:01:15.730\njust really draw you,\nliterally draw you a picture of,\n\n34\n00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.515\nis the relationship between a SIRT and\nits constituency.\n\n35\n00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:22.840\nYou've heard me talk about this before,\nbut I wanna just paint you a picture and\n\n36\n00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.140\nactually give credit where credit is due,\nbecause Daniel painted us a picture.\n\n37\n00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.610\nHe was kind enough to create\nthe diagram for us, but\n\n38\n00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.480\nI wanna show off his\nsplendid artistic work.\n\n39\n00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.010\nAnd quickly just give you a visual on this\nbefore we jump into our conversation about\n\n40\n00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.950\nwhat a CERT,\na Community Emergency Response Team, or\n\n41\n00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.940\nComputer Emergency Response Team will be,\n\n42\n00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.510\na little bit of a different\ntake on what a CCERT is.\n\n43\n00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.810\nIf we go to my machine here for\njust a minute, we can take a look.\n\n44\n00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.620\nWe'll see that we have our\npicture of what a traditional\n\n45\n00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.090\nSIRT capability may look like.\n\n46\n00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.100\nSo up here at the top you'll see\nwe have our traditional SIRT,\n\n47\n00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.010\nwe labeled it a Coordinating SIRT.\n\n48\n00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.170\nPut a little P under there that\ndesignate parent versus child.\n\n49\n00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.020\nBecause we may have a hierarchy, so\n\n50\n00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.950\nthere may be more than one\nSIRT that we're working with.\n\n51\n00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.220\nAnd so, for instance,\nwe may see that there is a national,\n\n52\n00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.890\na federal, a regional kinda SIRT that's\nexternal to the business, right?\n\n53\n00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.460\nSo we may reference that.\n\n54\n00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.300\nWe've given you some examples of those.\n\n55\n00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.095\nAnd then we may have our own internal\nSIRT, a Coordinating SIRT, that is a child\n\n56\n00:02:25.095 --> 00:02:29.838\nof that, that references that, but\nis directly linked to our constituency.\n\n57\n00:02:29.838 --> 00:02:35.090\nAnd you could see down here in the middle\ntier we've label that in the rectangle.\n\n58\n00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.266\nGood use of color there,\nby the way, my good sir.\n\n59\n00:02:37.266 --> 00:02:39.870\nThank you, very bright and vibrant yellow.\n\n60\n00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.990\nAnd we see we have C=Child,\nwhich just simply designates that this\n\n61\n00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.868\nrelationship between the Coordinating\nCSIRTs is one of a secondary/primary,\n\n62\n00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:51.230\nor parent/child kind of relationship.\n\n63\n00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.380\nAnd then the Constituency,\n\n64\n00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.740\nin the oval down here at the bottom,\nis really just meant to describe or\n\n65\n00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.370\ndesignate for us the idea that we have our\naudience, right, whatever that may be.\n\n66\n00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.560\nAnd that our audience that\nthe CSIRT is going to be servicing\n\n67\n00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.240\nis defined and connected to, in this case,\nthe child Coordinating SIRT.\n\n68\n00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.930\nAnd that's where that particular\nrelationship develops.\n\n69\n00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.420\nSo just wanted to make sure\nwe got a chance to see that.\n\n70\n00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.480\nSometimes a picture literally\nis gonna be the way to go, and\n\n71\n00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.390\nit does give you that visual reference.\n\n72\n00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.010\nIt helps us to better understand\nwhat that relationship looks like.\n\n73\n00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.679\nWe may just see a single SIRT and\na Constituency.\n\n74\n00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:32.699\nSo we may remove, let's say perhaps,\neven the middle or the top SIRT,\n\n75\n00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:36.250\ndoesn't really matter which one\nwe would take out of the loop.\n\n76\n00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.030\nBut one of them would disappear, and\nwe would have an alternate scenario where\n\n77\n00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.930\nwe just have our primary SIRT\nbeing the internal SIRT.\n\n78\n00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.095\nRemember, we talked about internal,\nexternal, advisory,\n\n79\n00:03:47.095 --> 00:03:49.692\ndifferent kinds of CSIRT categories.\n\n80\n00:03:49.692 --> 00:03:53.295\nAnd we would remove one of those\nin the relationship, in theory,\n\n81\n00:03:53.295 --> 00:03:57.814\nand simply just have a direct one to one\nrelationship between the Constituency and\n\n82\n00:03:57.814 --> 00:04:00.920\nthe CSIRT, and\nthat would be an internal designation.\n\n83\n00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.460\nSo it could look different ways\ndepending on what you're diagramming or\n\n84\n00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.760\npotentially what your particular set up or\narchitecture may be.\n\n85\n00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.678\nJust wanna make sure you're\ncomfortable with that, and\n\n86\n00:04:10.678 --> 00:04:12.208\nthat you have a sense of that.\n\n87\n00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.370\nAll right, having said that, what I'd\nlike to do is, I'd like to go ahead and\n\n88\n00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.860\nhave a little bit of a conversation\nwith you around the idea of a CERT.\n\n89\n00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.660\nWhat a CERT is, C-E-R-T,\nCommunity Emergency Response Team.\n\n90\n00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.720\nAlso commonly referred to as\nComputer Emergency Response Team.\n\n91\n00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.297\nThis is designed to provide aid and\nresource and capabilities to individuals,\n\n92\n00:04:32.297 --> 00:04:36.345\nto communities, and/or to organizations\nthat may have problems and\n\n93\n00:04:36.345 --> 00:04:38.165\nare obviously gonna benefit from that.\n\n94\n00:04:38.165 --> 00:04:41.605\nCERTs will traditionally use\nseveral different methodologies.\n\n95\n00:04:41.605 --> 00:04:45.645\nI wanna spend a few minutes going through\nthe methodology thought process with you.\n\n96\n00:04:45.645 --> 00:04:50.745\nWe have a methodology called OCTAVE, and\nthen there's some variations of OCTAVE.\n\n97\n00:04:50.745 --> 00:04:55.527\nSo we'll be able to take a look at or\nthink about OCTAVE as a method itself.\n\n98\n00:04:55.527 --> 00:04:57.526\nWe also have OCTAVE Allegro, OCTAVE-S,\n\n99\n00:04:57.526 --> 00:05:00.520\nwe'll take a look at some of\nthese different derivatives.\n\n100\n00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:07.140\nBut OCTAVE is gonna stand for\nOperationally Critical Threat, Assess.\n\n101\n00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:12.050\nLet me try that again,\nOperationally Critical Threat, Asset,\n\n102\n00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.290\nnot Asset, you don't say asset,\nwe say asset, right?\n\n103\n00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.870\nOperationally Critical Threat,\nAsset and Vulnerability Evaluation.\n\n104\n00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.570\nThat's what the acronym OCTAVE stands for.\n\n105\n00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.723\n&gt;&gt; You need to get the right\nemphasis on the syllable.\n\n106\n00:05:22.723 --> 00:05:26.793\n&gt;&gt; You do have to get the right emphasis\non the syllable to say asset correctly and\n\n107\n00:05:26.793 --> 00:05:28.360\npronounce it as asset.\n\n108\n00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.920\nSo make sure just that you know that\nit is an asset, and I know you do.\n\n109\n00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.250\nBut Operationally Critical Threat,\nAsset and\n\n110\n00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.620\nVulnerability Evaluation is what\nthe OCTAVE methodology is defined as.\n\n111\n00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.860\nA set of tools, and techniques and\nmechanisms that we will use in order to\n\n112\n00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.136\nfigure out our operational environment,\nand understand it better and manage it.\n\n113\n00:05:47.136 --> 00:05:50.550\nIt's typically a methodolgy that gets\nimplemented using small three to five\n\n114\n00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.545\nperson teams and a series of meetings\nthat are then gonna sketch out and\n\n115\n00:05:54.545 --> 00:05:57.325\nmanage through the logic\nof what we need to do.\n\n116\n00:05:57.325 --> 00:06:02.505\nThink about risk based information\nassessment, so we're thinking about ways\n\n117\n00:06:02.505 --> 00:06:06.380\nin which we can understand better what\nthe operational risk environment may be.\n\n118\n00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.790\nAnd we do risk evaluations\nusing this methodology.\n\n119\n00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.220\nSo it's an interesting\nway to approach this.\n\n120\n00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.680\nLet's go ahead and do the following, I'm\njust gonna scroll down here one minute so\n\n121\n00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.700\nwe can take a look.\n\n122\n00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.790\nIf you would go to my machine,\nlet's just put up a little\n\n123\n00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.170\nset of notes I've created for\nus to drive the conversation.\n\n124\n00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:26.300\nAgain, a little bit too much\nknowledge just to verbally relay\n\n125\n00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.700\nwithout being able to\nkeep track of it all.\n\n126\n00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.740\nSo thought a little chart,\nor a little table every so\n\n127\n00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.940\noften is a good thing,\nbreaks up the monotony,\n\n128\n00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.650\nplus you don't have to look at my\nsmiling face while I'm talking to you.\n\n129\n00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.890\nSo it's probably a good break for\nyou as well.\n\n130\n00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.530\nSo I mentioned there are three OCTAVE\nmethods, you'll see them there.\n\n131\n00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.640\nOCTAVE itself, OCTAVE-S,\nand OCTAVE-Allegro.\n\n132\n00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.910\nWe'll go through each one quickly and\ntalk about them.\n\n133\n00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.240\nBut OCTAVE, as you can see,\nthree phased approach.\n\n134\n00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.890\nWe go through and look at organizational\nand technology related issues.\n\n135\n00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:57.910\nWe run this as a series of workshops,\nas I suggested.\n\n136\n00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.480\nIt's usually an interdisciplinary\nthought process.\n\n137\n00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.220\nYou have members from different\nareas of the business taking part\n\n138\n00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.070\nin this three to five person team meeting.\n\n139\n00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:11.380\nAnd the three phases are gonna have\nsub-processes associated with them,\n\n140\n00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:12.520\nas you can see.\n\n141\n00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.350\nPhase 1,\nBuild Asset Based Threat Profiles.\n\n142\n00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.530\nAnd underneath there we\nhave four processes,\n\n143\n00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:21.420\nIdentify Senior Management Knowledge,\nIdentify operational area management\n\n144\n00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.940\nknowledge, Identify staff knowledge,\nand Create threat profiles.\n\n145\n00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:29.890\nSo these are the actionable processes\nthat we would engage in in Phase 1 of\n\n146\n00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.860\nthe OCTAVE method, referred to as\nBuilding Asset Based Threat Profiles.\n\n147\n00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.560\nIn Phase 2,\nIdentify Infrastructure Vulnerabilities.\n\n148\n00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.030\nProcesses 5 and 6,\nIdentify the key components, and\n\n149\n00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:45.420\nevaluation of the selected components\nto ensure that we understand what\n\n150\n00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:50.090\nthe vulnerability assessment will look\nlike, what the vulnerability map may be.\n\n151\n00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.885\nIn Phase 3,\nDevelop Security Strategy Plans.\n\n152\n00:07:52.885 --> 00:07:56.351\nSo take all the information\nderived in Phases 1 and\n\n153\n00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:58.857\n2 through Processes 1 through 6.\n\n154\n00:07:58.857 --> 00:08:03.160\nAnd distill that down by developing\na security strategic plan,\n\n155\n00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.470\nin order to engage in conducting\na risk analysis process seven.\n\n156\n00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:11.150\nBut ultimately in process eight,\ndevelopment of protection strategies.\n\n157\n00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:14.010\nAnd when you think about the logic of\nthis and kind of the thought process,\n\n158\n00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:19.340\nas we go down from phase one,\nwe kind of move down and we\n\n159\n00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:23.790\ngo through these individual processes and\nwe get a lot of background information.\n\n160\n00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:29.350\nAnd we get all of the information maps\nthat we need to understand who the key\n\n161\n00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:34.800\nplayers are, what the key technologies\nare, what are the likely threat profiles.\n\n162\n00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.950\nThink of threat profiles as use cases by\nthe way we could even just put that in\n\n163\n00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:43.720\nhere kind of in brackets just so\nyou have a sense of that, right.\n\n164\n00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:47.740\nWe don't formally call them use cases in\nthe methodology but I'm using that as\n\n165\n00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:51.390\na way to refer to something that you\nprobably a little more familiar with.\n\n166\n00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:55.410\nYou don't often hear people say I need to\ngo develop threat profile but you do hear\n\n167\n00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:59.560\npeople talk a lot about the fact that they\nare using and are developing use cases.\n\n168\n00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.430\nAnd essentially they're the same thing.\n\n169\n00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:06.250\nThreat profiles are the story we\ntell around what the threat may be,\n\n170\n00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:09.690\nor threats we may be facing,\nand what we have to assess.\n\n171\n00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:12.610\nAnd those are then used as\nthe basis to understand how to\n\n172\n00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:16.960\nidentify vulnerabilities in\nthe infrastructure based on that scenario.\n\n173\n00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:21.110\nAnd a scenario's another keyword\nwe may use along with use cases.\n\n174\n00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:22.689\nBe happy to put that in there as well.\n\n175\n00:09:25.148 --> 00:09:27.825\nRight, and so\nwhether they're use cases or scenarios,\n\n176\n00:09:27.825 --> 00:09:30.520\nthat's what the threat\nprofile's really referred to.\n\n177\n00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.580\nJust to give you a better sense of that.\n\n178\n00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:35.800\nAnd then based on that,\nwe'll identify the key components and\n\n179\n00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:39.000\nthe evaluation of those components\ntake place in phase two.\n\n180\n00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.830\nIn phase three,\nwe then do an all up risk analysis.\n\n181\n00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:46.260\nAnd based on that, we developer\ntailor protection strategies for\n\n182\n00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.210\nthe specific threat profiles\nthat we've generated.\n\n183\n00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:52.690\nSo if we say we think there's\na threat against web services,\n\n184\n00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:56.810\nbased on the use of\nApache Server build 5.2,\n\n185\n00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:02.680\nset up this way with this infrastructure\non the back end to support it.\n\n186\n00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:07.260\nP-GRASS or open PostGIS database,\nwhatever it may be,\n\n187\n00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.980\nthen that's the protection strategy\nthat we're gonna ultimately come up with\n\n188\n00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:14.630\nbased on the threat profile and\nthe risk analysis in OCTAVE, right.\n\n189\n00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:18.090\nSo it's a pretty detailed,\nright, pretty thorough, and\n\n190\n00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:20.730\npretty intense method\nthat we are engaging in.\n\n191\n00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:25.480\nWe're looking at all of the different\nareas, potentially, that may be impacted.\n\n192\n00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.760\nNow, when we look at OCTAVE S, just\nbring this up to the top of the screen.\n\n193\n00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.110\nAnother derivative of OCTAVE,\n\n194\n00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:32.680\na slightly different approach,\nlittle bit more streamline.\n\n195\n00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:37.560\nSometimes people call this OCTAVE light,\nbecause it streamlines.\n\n196\n00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.600\n&gt;&gt; It has half the calories.\n\n197\n00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.710\n&gt;&gt; And has half the calories.\n\n198\n00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:41.760\nAnd it's twice as tasty, right?\n\n199\n00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.590\nBut OCTAVE S is how it is referred to.\n\n200\n00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:46.050\nS for streamlined.\n\n201\n00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:50.860\nSo a streamlined process,\nslightly different set of worksheets and\n\n202\n00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.350\nworkshops that we go through, but\n\n203\n00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.530\nessentially produces the same\nresults as the OCTAVE method.\n\n204\n00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.810\nThat actually should be workshops,\nnot worksheets.\n\n205\n00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:00.430\nI'll correct that and\nmake sure we change that.\n\n206\n00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:01.600\nLet me just do that right now.\n\n207\n00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.140\nI didn't catch that when I was typing.\n\n208\n00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.230\nThat should be workshops.\n\n209\n00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:09.650\nAll right, so workshops there we go but\nproduces the same results\n\n210\n00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:13.510\nagain three to five people teams that are\ngoing through this but it's limited and\n\n211\n00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:15.930\nthis is the part that is the streamlining.\n\n212\n00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:19.950\nIt is limited to the exploration of\nthe computer infrastructure itself so\n\n213\n00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:23.080\nwe're really just looking at the amount\nof network infrastructure, but\n\n214\n00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.370\nthe computer infrastructure itself.\n\n215\n00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:29.640\nNot the broad encompassing\narchitecture of the entire system.\n\n216\n00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.120\nMeaning the network and\nall the supporting elements.\n\n217\n00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.000\nSo it's a little bit\nmore limited in focus.\n\n218\n00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.638\nAnd OCTAVE Allegro, as we can see here.\n\n219\n00:11:37.638 --> 00:11:40.810\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] Histamine blocker, right?\n\n220\n00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:41.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly right.\n\n221\n00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.290\nTake this one, you have high pollen\ncounts in your neighborhoods.\n\n222\n00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.810\nSo, another streamline variation of OCTAVE\n\n223\n00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:50.560\nfocuses traditionally on\ninformation assets, as you can see.\n\n224\n00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.160\nIs again a work style,\n\n225\n00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:56.050\nworkshop kind of style collaborative\nenvironment thought process.\n\n226\n00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:59.230\nSimilar to what team scrum, for instance,\nright, if you're doing agile scrum.\n\n227\n00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:01.680\nIt's almost like that where you're\nfocusing in on a sprint and\n\n228\n00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.620\nyou're dealing with a very narrowly\ndefined set of thought processes.\n\n229\n00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:11.600\nWe go through and do asset identification,\nand we base our assessment on or\n\n230\n00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:16.630\naround those assets that are identified,\nbut we also look at information for\n\n231\n00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:20.360\nthose assets in terms of\na connectivity web, right?\n\n232\n00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.780\nSo what assets are dependent on others?\n\n233\n00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:24.590\nAnd them we're gonna\nlook at that as a result.\n\n234\n00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:27.922\nWe have eight steps and\nfour phases in this particular one.\n\n235\n00:12:27.922 --> 00:12:30.538\nYou'll see the four phases\nlisted here in the steps.\n\n236\n00:12:30.538 --> 00:12:32.870\nWe don't really name the phases we\njust say we have phase one, two,\n\n237\n00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:33.760\nthree, and four.\n\n238\n00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.980\nSo phase one there's one step,\n\n239\n00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.480\nestablishment of a risk\nassessment criteria.\n\n240\n00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.135\nPhase two, our steps two and three\ndeveloping information asset profiles,\n\n241\n00:12:42.135 --> 00:12:46.880\nidentify information asset containers, so\nwhat kind of information are we looking\n\n242\n00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.070\nat, where is that information,\nlet's map that out.\n\n243\n00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:54.250\nPhase three, identify areas of concern,\nidentify threat scenarios again,\n\n244\n00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:57.075\nthreat scenarios, use cases,\nright, things like that.\n\n245\n00:12:57.075 --> 00:13:01.050\nPhase four, identify risk,\nanalyze risk, and\n\n246\n00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:02.820\nultimately select mitigation approaches.\n\n247\n00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:07.240\nVery similar to OCTAVE except\nthat we're just changing around\n\n248\n00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:11.080\nthe language we use in some of the steps\nbut we wind up in the same place.\n\n249\n00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:15.750\nWe ultimately identify risk, analyze\nit through the use of scenario driven\n\n250\n00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:19.000\nassessment and once we've done\nthat we then go through and\n\n251\n00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.060\ncome up with whatever our mitigation\napproach may be obviously based on\n\n252\n00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:26.950\nwhatever the most appropriate outcome will\nbe given the scenario or the case study or\n\n253\n00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:30.900\nthe used case that were attempting to\naddress with this particular method.\n\n254\n00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:34.020\nSo we get these questions a lot,\nhey what I do this once and\n\n255\n00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:35.300\nwould it cover everyday?\n\n256\n00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.820\nDo I do this iteratively?\n\n257\n00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.190\nHow often do I do it?\n\n258\n00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:39.800\nYou know these are great\nquestions to ask right?\n\n259\n00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.290\nCuz if haven't done this\nbefore you may not know.\n\n260\n00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:46.190\nSo clearly this is an iterative model,\nmeaning you may do this multiple times\n\n261\n00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:50.000\ngiven the use of threat scenarios or\nuse cases.\n\n262\n00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.310\nCuz you may develop a variety of them and\nhave to test them and\n\n263\n00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:54.400\nassess them as you go.\n\n264\n00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.920\nSo this is definitely seen as an iterative\nprocess where you may engage in rounds or\n\n265\n00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.330\nmultiples of this.\n\n266\n00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.040\nThis is something that should\nbe re-invigorated and,\n\n267\n00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:07.140\nessentially, gone back to and\nreevaluated over periods of time.\n\n268\n00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:10.510\nSo, if you do this, let's say at\nthe beginning of a business cycle,\n\n269\n00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:15.460\nwhether it's a calendar or\na fiscal year that runs, for\n\n270\n00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:19.910\nsome sort of September to September for\nthe federal government that kind of thing\n\n271\n00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:23.170\nwhatever it may be, if you do this\nat the beginning of that cycle,\n\n272\n00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:26.550\nis it every three months,\nis it every six months, is it once a year?\n\n273\n00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:30.730\nAgain no right and wrong from a time\nperspective per se, but we know that you\n\n274\n00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:35.510\nneed to do this more then once in a given\nperiod of time because risks do change.\n\n275\n00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:39.320\nThreats do modify, multiply and morph.\n\n276\n00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.630\nAnd we have to understand there will be\nnew vulnerabilities that will come about\n\n277\n00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:45.590\nthat we're not anticipating\nin the first round of this.\n\n278\n00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:51.210\nSo traditionally we will recommend\nthat this gets done every six months,\n\n279\n00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:54.680\nmaybe once a quarter, maybe once a year.\n\n280\n00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:58.530\nI like to try, as I've shared with\nyou before, to get my customers,\n\n281\n00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.670\nmy students, my people I work with.\n\n282\n00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:05.200\nTo think about this as being an extension\nof strategic planning in the business.\n\n283\n00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:09.540\nIf you're doing a yearly, annual strategic\nplanning cycle all up and around that,\n\n284\n00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:11.700\nyou're doing your audit preparation work,\n\n285\n00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:15.740\nyour BCDR, refresh,\nyour risk assessment refresh.\n\n286\n00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:19.590\nThen all that planning and all that work\nis kind of done with a maybe two to three\n\n287\n00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:23.920\nmonth arc around that cycle,\nall these things feed each other, right?\n\n288\n00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:28.550\nSo if you do a full refresh on\nthe OCTAVE methodology and assessment.\n\n289\n00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:31.285\nYou can use this to drive your\nbusiness impact analysis,\n\n290\n00:15:31.285 --> 00:15:35.030\nyou can use this to drive\nyour update on the BCDR plan.\n\n291\n00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:37.980\nYou can use this to drive\nthe refresh on strategic planning.\n\n292\n00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.940\nYou can use this to update\nyour documentation, so\n\n293\n00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.940\nall those things will feed each other.\n\n294\n00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:46.220\nWe wanna make sure we're thinking\nabout that because it is important.\n\n295\n00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:50.120\nThese are streams that get pollinated\nindividually traditionally, right?\n\n296\n00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:54.726\nBut we do wanna cross them at some point\nand have them essentially feed each other,\n\n297\n00:15:54.726 --> 00:15:57.418\nso we can benefit from\nthe work we do in one area.\n\n298\n00:15:57.418 --> 00:16:00.333\nAnd ensure that it is being updated,\nand therefore accounted for,\n\n299\n00:16:00.333 --> 00:16:03.161\nin all of the other areas that\nare gonna benefit from it, as well.\n\n300\n00:16:03.161 --> 00:16:08.037\n&gt;&gt; So Adam, I see that all these\ndifferent These different OCTAVE\n\n301\n00:16:08.037 --> 00:16:12.361\nmethods have their focus,\nper se, is it beneficial for\n\n302\n00:16:12.361 --> 00:16:18.380\nus to maybe do all three of them in\na given system, or is that overkill?\n\n303\n00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:20.920\n&gt;&gt; So it's another great question, right?\n\n304\n00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:25.400\nEssentially, do we get everything we need\nout of only one, or do we need to sample\n\n305\n00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:30.040\nor perhaps have a, what do they call them,\nthe sampler platter of Octave methods.\n\n306\n00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.100\nA little bit of each, right?\n\n307\n00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.600\nA little buffet, take a little bit\nof this, a little bit of that.\n\n308\n00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.490\n&gt;&gt; Tapas, [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; There you go, OCTAVE tapas.\n\n309\n00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:40.750\nSo it's a great thought process that\nDaniel asked us to focus on here,\n\n310\n00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:44.030\nbecause there are situations,\nno doubt about it,\n\n311\n00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:47.670\nwhere one of those approaches by\nitself may not be enough, right?\n\n312\n00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:50.700\nBecause if we do OCTAVE all\nUp As the general OCTAVE method,\n\n313\n00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:54.850\nwe tend to be able to get the more\nstreamlined information as part of that.\n\n314\n00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:56.540\nBut if we're not thinking about, and\n\n315\n00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:01.000\nit really comes down to how we craft\nour threat scenarios or our use cases.\n\n316\n00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.110\nRight, cuz we do a very broad coverage,\nbut we don't develop enough use cases,\n\n317\n00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:10.080\nwe're not gonna delve into,\nperhaps as deeply as we may need to,\n\n318\n00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:15.480\nthe system and the information\ndependency web architecture for\n\n319\n00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:21.020\nassets that Allegro and Streamline\nhelp us to focus in on as subsets.\n\n320\n00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:24.180\nSo it's a good idea to\nbe thinking about that.\n\n321\n00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:25.410\nCould you do it all in one?\n\n322\n00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:28.770\nYeah, absolutely, if you develop enough\nthreat scenarios and use cases and\n\n323\n00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:32.770\ndo the assessment iteratively, yeah,\nabsolutely, you could get to it all.\n\n324\n00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:36.935\nBut if you wanna be able to focus just\nin on the computer system itself,\n\n325\n00:17:36.935 --> 00:17:39.650\nStreamlined is that\nmethodology that does that,\n\n326\n00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:43.470\nversus the broader assessment of\nthe organizational architecture.\n\n327\n00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:46.420\nIf you need to focus in on\nthe information assets and\n\n328\n00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:50.890\ndependencies between them, Allegro helps\nus to do that as a methodology, where that\n\n329\n00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:55.000\nmay get lost in the All Up method\noverall for OCTAVE cuz we may not have\n\n330\n00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.580\nthe scenarios created to be able to bring\nthat general focus to bear, if you will.\n\n331\n00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.740\nSo I think it's a great question,\nvery timely, good to ask.\n\n332\n00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:04.800\nAnd it's a good thing to think\nabout as incident handlers.\n\n333\n00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:08.439\nWhat are the outcomes we're looking to\nachieve is really what Daniel is asking us\n\n334\n00:18:08.439 --> 00:18:10.380\nto consider, in kind of a roundabout way.\n\n335\n00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:14.955\nWill this one or multiple assessment\napproach feed those requirements and\n\n336\n00:18:14.955 --> 00:18:16.550\ngive us what we need?\n\n337\n00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:19.582\nAnd the answer is, like all good answers,\nit depends, right.\n\n338\n00:18:19.582 --> 00:18:20.359\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n339\n00:18:20.359 --> 00:18:24.073\nwe have to think about what the strategic\nrequirements are we're assessing,\n\n340\n00:18:24.073 --> 00:18:28.122\nbut we may, to Daniel's point, have to run\nmore than one set or series of assessments\n\n341\n00:18:28.122 --> 00:18:32.079\nusing one or more methodology in order to\naddress all the strategic requirements.\n\n342\n00:18:32.079 --> 00:18:34.370\nSo it's a very good thought process for\n\n343\n00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:38.840\nus to at least air out and\ntalk about as we're going through this.\n\n344\n00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:42.850\n&gt;&gt; Very cool stuff,\nthese computer emergency response teams.\n\n345\n00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:47.790\nObviously they kinda have their own\nsubsets when it comes to response teams,\n\n346\n00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:51.600\nper se, or in and of themselves, so it's\nnice for us to make those distinctions.\n\n347\n00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.690\nWhat's the difference between something\nlike a C-CERT versus a CERT, and\n\n348\n00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:57.520\nwhat kind of methodologies do they use?\n\n349\n00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:01.980\nObviously, these OCTAVE methods are very\nbeneficial for those types of teams.\n\n350\n00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.280\nSo learn them, apply them as necessary.\n\n351\n00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:05.384\nLather, rinse, repeat.\n\n352\n00:19:05.384 --> 00:19:07.426\n[LAUGH] That being said, Adam,\n\n353\n00:19:07.426 --> 00:19:12.280\nis there anything else we need to cover\nwhen it comes to CCERT in general?\n\n354\n00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.201\n&gt;&gt; Just one quick thing,\nsince we're talking about it.\n\n355\n00:19:14.201 --> 00:19:18.070\nAnd just let me talk and\nperhaps we could talk for a moment.\n\n356\n00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:19.545\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; I just wanna bring up quickly, and\n\n357\n00:19:19.545 --> 00:19:21.225\nI'm gonna move to the side\nhere just to do this.\n\n358\n00:19:21.225 --> 00:19:23.785\nI wanna bring up quickly, cuz we did\nthis in one of the prior episodes.\n\n359\n00:19:23.785 --> 00:19:25.955\nBut it's probably real timely\nto do it here as well.\n\n360\n00:19:25.955 --> 00:19:28.420\nJust give me a moment to bring up my\nweb browser while I'm talking to you.\n\n361\n00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:30.065\nCuz I really didn't\nthink ahead to do this.\n\n362\n00:19:30.065 --> 00:19:34.558\nBut I brought up a bunch of different\nwebsites in one of the first areas we had\n\n363\n00:19:34.558 --> 00:19:38.068\nour discussion in, and\none of them was the US-CERT site.\n\n364\n00:19:38.068 --> 00:19:40.405\nAnd I just want to bring\nthat back up real quick and\n\n365\n00:19:40.405 --> 00:19:42.460\njust make sure that we're able to do that.\n\n366\n00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.070\nIf you go to my screen,\nI have it up and running right now.\n\n367\n00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:48.060\nSo you'll see, I just went to Google\nhere real quick, no big deal, right?\n\n368\n00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.890\nThe oracle of the Internet,\nas I refer to it.\n\n369\n00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:55.300\nAnd you'll see I just typed in US-CERT for\nthe United States CERT,\n\n370\n00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:58.620\nComputer Emergency Response Team or\nReadiness Team.\n\n371\n00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:01.510\nAnd you'll see that we have\na link here to the main site.\n\n372\n00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:02.936\nAnd I showed this site to you before.\n\n373\n00:20:02.936 --> 00:20:05.280\nYou could see the US-CERT site.\n\n374\n00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:09.258\nIt's up underneath the Department\nof Homeland Security as much or\n\n375\n00:20:09.258 --> 00:20:12.177\nmany of these kinds of\nresources are these days.\n\n376\n00:20:12.177 --> 00:20:16.070\nAnd you'll see that we have a Home tab.\n\n377\n00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.690\nAbout Us.\n\n378\n00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:17.530\nPublications.\n\n379\n00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:18.363\nAlerts &amp; Tips.\n\n380\n00:20:18.363 --> 00:20:19.481\nRelated Resources.\n\n381\n00:20:19.481 --> 00:20:21.563\nBut if we go into Alerts &amp; Tips,\n\n382\n00:20:21.563 --> 00:20:26.052\nwe'll see that we can bring up\nthe National Cyber Awareness System.\n\n383\n00:20:26.052 --> 00:20:27.671\nWe can take a look at current activity.\n\n384\n00:20:27.671 --> 00:20:28.998\nAlerts.\n\n385\n00:20:28.998 --> 00:20:30.740\nBulletins, things like that.\n\n386\n00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:33.578\nSo if we go into Current Activity,\nwe can take a look and\n\n387\n00:20:33.578 --> 00:20:37.770\nsee there's a Cisco release of a security\nupdate that recently took place.\n\n388\n00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:41.210\nLook like Apple also released\na security update recently.\n\n389\n00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:43.476\nSo you get a kind of a running list.\n\n390\n00:20:43.476 --> 00:20:46.430\nWe may not be up-to-date\non what Apple's been doing.\n\n391\n00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:48.379\nMaybe we just haven't had\ntime to figure that out.\n\n392\n00:20:48.379 --> 00:20:53.060\nIt's a good place to get that centrally\naggregated information that may help us.\n\n393\n00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:54.250\nI may say, hey, you know what?\n\n394\n00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:55.770\nI'm running an Apple product,\n\n395\n00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:59.370\ndidn't realize there was security update,\nmaybe I should check that out.\n\n396\n00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:02.500\nAnd we can go and we can take a look and\nread the full entry right here.\n\n397\n00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.160\nAnd so we could go and\nsee what this is, and\n\n398\n00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.310\njust go down and scroll down,\ntake a look at this.\n\n399\n00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:12.270\nAnd so we can see, looks like you\ngo to the Apple security page for\n\n400\n00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:15.950\nLogic Pro X, and apply a necessary update,\ntells us a little bit about it.\n\n401\n00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:18.550\nSo, whatever the vulnerability was,\nthat's where we would go,\n\n402\n00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:19.635\nthere's a link right there.\n\n403\n00:21:19.635 --> 00:21:22.430\nSo this kind of stuff\nbecomes very helpful.\n\n404\n00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:26.420\nAnd again, most countries in\nthe world have some sort of CSRT or\n\n405\n00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:29.430\nCERT capability that\nthey run as an entity.\n\n406\n00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:32.460\nAnd that is usually managed by\nthe government, or managed by\n\n407\n00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:36.280\nan arm associated with the government,\nlike NIST for instance, associated with\n\n408\n00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:40.600\nthe US government, but not directly\nthe front end of the US government.\n\n409\n00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:44.790\nAnd as a result, they're gonna\nbe able to provide this for you.\n\n410\n00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:50.194\nAnd if you go and\njust go to Google, just overall and\n\n411\n00:21:50.194 --> 00:21:57.501\njust do something like country cert,\nright, or country computer.\n\n412\n00:22:01.607 --> 00:22:03.120\nCERT or something like that.\n\n413\n00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:07.130\nYou'll get a list of national CERTs,\nright, from the CERT division.\n\n414\n00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:09.730\nCSRTs by country, ENISA creates and\n\n415\n00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:12.615\nhas a really cool interactive map\nthat you can drill through, and\n\n416\n00:22:12.615 --> 00:22:16.980\nthis is the European Information Security\nAssociation for the European Union, right?\n\n417\n00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.890\nSo they're going to maintain that,\nwhich is actually really kind of cool.\n\n418\n00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:21.660\nLet's take a look at\nthat since we're here.\n\n419\n00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:22.750\nReal quick.\n\n420\n00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:27.000\nAnd this one is actually a lot of,\ngot a lot of interesting information.\n\n421\n00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:33.014\nSo when we scroll down, just get rid\nof our little cookie prompt there.\n\n422\n00:22:33.014 --> 00:22:36.474\nWhen we scroll down, we can see,\nyou have the map we could search for\n\n423\n00:22:36.474 --> 00:22:38.320\nthe name of WAN if we know what it is.\n\n424\n00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.170\nBut we also can go, and\nthey have a nice listing here.\n\n425\n00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:47.343\nSo they show us each one, whichever one it\nis, from Austria or Azerbaijan, Belgium.\n\n426\n00:22:47.343 --> 00:22:49.421\nYou kind of go through,\nthey do it alphabetical.\n\n427\n00:22:49.421 --> 00:22:51.957\nAnd so we can see the different\nones that are listed.\n\n428\n00:22:51.957 --> 00:22:54.325\nCzech Republic has a bunch,\nFrance has a bunch.\n\n429\n00:22:54.325 --> 00:22:57.305\nSo as you scroll down, and\nlet me do this quickly.\n\n430\n00:22:57.305 --> 00:23:00.360\n[SOUND] That's everything,\ndid you get all that?\n\n431\n00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:01.184\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n432\n00:23:01.184 --> 00:23:01.968\n&gt;&gt; What was number 25?\n\n433\n00:23:01.968 --> 00:23:02.674\nQuickly.\n\n434\n00:23:02.674 --> 00:23:03.844\n&gt;&gt; It was the United Kingdom.\n\n435\n00:23:03.844 --> 00:23:04.630\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n436\n00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:07.790\nSo you can see we have all\nof the different ones here.\n\n437\n00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:11.480\nAnd so, you know, if we just randomly\nwanted to be able to highlight one and\n\n438\n00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:12.530\ntake a look at it.\n\n439\n00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:17.410\nWe could see that there's European Union,\nnon-European Union related items.\n\n440\n00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:20.030\nThere's O2 Cert in the UK.\n\n441\n00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:24.137\nThere's St. Andrews CSRT,\nGEANT CERT, WAR-CSRT, etc.\n\n442\n00:23:24.137 --> 00:23:26.260\nThese are all UK-related ones, right?\n\n443\n00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:30.890\nAnd so it's nice because they\ngive us this information, but\n\n444\n00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:34.220\nthen we can also go in and\nwe can take a look.\n\n445\n00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:36.570\nWe can download this list as a CSV.\n\n446\n00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:40.100\nWe can download kind of\nan executive summary.\n\n447\n00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:41.770\nBut we could also download the full PDF.\n\n448\n00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:45.860\nAnd so when you do the full PDF and\ndownload that.\n\n449\n00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:49.047\nAnd then once we get that, we actually\nthen can open that up, right, and\n\n450\n00:23:49.047 --> 00:23:51.550\ntake a look at it,\nwhich would be kind of cool.\n\n451\n00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:52.626\nThere we go.\nIt's coming down right now.\n\n452\n00:23:52.626 --> 00:23:57.554\nAnd so we get the information\nwith their website URL and\n\n453\n00:23:57.554 --> 00:24:01.530\njust the associated information about it.\n\n454\n00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:03.480\nAnd it's however many pages it is.\n\n455\n00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:07.130\nBut the point is, we have accurate\ninformation that as an incident handler\n\n456\n00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:11.270\nwould help us to better understand where\nsome of these resources are around,\n\n457\n00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:16.090\nat least in the EU anyway, in the European\nassociated countries that are either\n\n458\n00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:18.100\npartners or non-partners of the EU.\n\n459\n00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:21.234\nBut we can get a general listing\nof the majority of them, right.\n\n460\n00:24:21.234 --> 00:24:22.700\nAnd there's other lists to list.\n\n461\n00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:26.040\nThe entire global catalog,\nwhich is bigger than this.\n\n462\n00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:27.050\nThis is a subset of them.\n\n463\n00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:29.930\nBut if these kind of resources\nmay be helpful, if you're\n\n464\n00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:33.140\nactually on the lookout in the country and\ntrying to say, hey, is there one or\n\n465\n00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:36.870\nmore CSRTs in my country that I may or\nmay not be able to leverage, right.\n\n466\n00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:38.843\nOr I need to connect to and\nhow to I find them.\n\n467\n00:24:38.843 --> 00:24:41.701\nSo this will give you a list that's\nup to date and authoritative and\n\n468\n00:24:41.701 --> 00:24:44.060\nbe a great way for\nyou to be able to find some resources.\n\n469\n00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:47.147\nSo since you asked, I just thought I'd,\nand I meant to do this earlier, so\n\n470\n00:24:47.147 --> 00:24:49.980\nI do apologize for not bringing\nit up sooner in our discussion.\n\n471\n00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:52.810\nBut I thought this would at least be\na valuable way to just close this out and\n\n472\n00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:54.730\nadd another resource to the list for\neverybody.\n\n473\n00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:56.890\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nanother tool in the tool kit, right?\n\n474\n00:24:56.890 --> 00:24:58.880\nIt never hurts any of us, that's for sure.\n\n475\n00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:03.140\nAdam, we do thank you for walking us\nthrough all this information about CSRTs\n\n476\n00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:07.463\nand things that are pertinent to our exam\nand as we become an incident handler in\n\n477\n00:25:07.463 --> 00:25:10.108\npractice, we can do that\npractically as well.\n\n478\n00:25:10.108 --> 00:25:13.170\nThat being said, it does look like\nit is time for us to sign off.\n\n479\n00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:15.150\nWe do thank you guys for joining us.\n\n480\n00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:17.960\nBut for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n481\n00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.536\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n482\n00:25:22.068 --> 00:25:24.638\n[MUSIC]\n\n483\n00:25:24.638 --> 00:25:30.255\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.035 --> 00:00:12.770\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n5\n00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.921\nGreetings everyone and welcome to\nanother great episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:20.214\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:20.214 --> 00:00:23.130\nwe're moving on with\nmore on our ECIH series.\n\n8\n00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.980\nAnd of course, joining us in the studio\nin the hot seat, our Master Blaster,\n\n9\n00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.140\nthe good man himself, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.970\nAdam, welcome back, sir.\n\n11\n00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:30.780\nHow's it going.\n\n12\n00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.910\n&gt;&gt; Master Blaster.\n\n13\n00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.375\nThat is from the second,\nI think of those, right.\n\n14\n00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:35.965\nHe's the-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n15\n00:00:35.965 --> 00:00:36.925\n&gt;&gt; He knows where it is.\n\n16\n00:00:36.925 --> 00:00:37.785\nI know where it is.\n\n17\n00:00:37.785 --> 00:00:39.905\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, from out Mad Max.\n\n18\n00:00:39.905 --> 00:00:40.525\n&gt;&gt; Wasteland.\n\n19\n00:00:40.525 --> 00:00:42.385\n&gt;&gt; Mad Max, but\nit's Mad Max beyond Thunder Dome.\n\n20\n00:00:42.385 --> 00:00:43.185\n&gt;&gt; It's beyond Thunder Dome, yes.\n\n21\n00:00:43.185 --> 00:00:44.575\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was the second one.\n\n22\n00:00:44.575 --> 00:00:45.635\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; With Tina Turner.\n\n23\n00:00:45.635 --> 00:00:46.645\n&gt;&gt; It's a great film.\n\n24\n00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:47.235\n&gt;&gt; They're all great.\n\n25\n00:00:47.235 --> 00:00:48.895\n&gt;&gt; I love them, I love them.\n\n26\n00:00:48.895 --> 00:00:50.387\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Talk about violence.\n\n27\n00:00:50.387 --> 00:00:51.055\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cars.\n\n28\n00:00:51.055 --> 00:00:54.770\n&gt;&gt; Full of it\n&gt;&gt; Mohawks and-\n\n29\n00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:55.690\n&gt;&gt; Crazy vehicles.\n\n30\n00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.160\n&gt;&gt; Crazy vehicles,\nthat was a good set of movies right there.\n\n31\n00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.440\nAll right, so here we are talking\nabout cinematographic masterpieces\n\n32\n00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.425\nof the late 20th and early 21st century.\n\n33\n00:01:06.425 --> 00:01:10.800\n[LAUGH] We're gonna talk a little\nbit about in this particular series\n\n34\n00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.830\nof episodes we're gonna switch\nour attention a little bit.\n\n35\n00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.820\nUp until now we've been talking\nabout the background information,\n\n36\n00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.680\nthe thought processes, the architecture,\nthe design, and the execution and\n\n37\n00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.260\nwhat it means to set up and\nbe able to respond to incidents.\n\n38\n00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.430\nNow we're gonna actually dig a little\ndeeper, dig under the covers, get through\n\n39\n00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.830\nall the theory, talk about some of the\ninteresting stuff that actually happens.\n\n40\n00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.180\nLet's talk about where\nthose incidents come from.\n\n41\n00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.240\nWhat kind of attacks are we gonna face.\n\n42\n00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.640\nWhat kind of tools do we have to\nuse to respond to those attacks?\n\n43\n00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.710\nAnd Daniel's volunteered to actually\nbe a live fire test subject for us.\n\n44\n00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.450\nAnd we're gonna see if we can actually\nchase him down the road here.\n\n45\n00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.860\nAnd see if we can actually execute\nsome of these attacks in real time.\n\n46\n00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.460\nWe're gonna do a little show and\ntell for you.\n\n47\n00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.690\nNot right now, but in a little bit\nwe're gonna take a look at some tools,\n\n48\n00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:56.970\ntake a look at Nessus.\n\n49\n00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.720\nTake a look at end graph,\ntake a look at Wireshark.\n\n50\n00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.550\nGo and take a look at some of the tools\nof the trade that the incident handler\n\n51\n00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.850\nis gonna be using as a result\nof that have a better sense\n\n52\n00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.500\nof some of the attacks that\nwe're gonna probably face.\n\n53\n00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.430\nAnd more often than not may already\nbe facing although we may not\n\n54\n00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.490\nrealized they're happening.\n\n55\n00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.410\nWe're gonna take a look at that as well.\n\n56\n00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.890\nSo we're gonna talk or\nstart talking about DOS and D-DOS or\n\n57\n00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.290\ndistributed denial of service and\ndenial of service attacks.\n\n58\n00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.220\nWhat are they.\n\n59\n00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.490\nWhy are they important.\n\n60\n00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.020\nWhy should you care.\n\n61\n00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.670\nComing to a theater soon near you.\n\n62\n00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.130\nSo denial of service attacks, DOS attacks.\n\n63\n00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.430\nCommon attack, probably one of the more\ncommon ones we face, quite honestly.\n\n64\n00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.460\nWhere one threat source, one bad actor\nis attempting to attack an individual\n\n65\n00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.530\nsystem or perhaps a network and cut off\naccess through that gateway to a system.\n\n66\n00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.010\nAnd it's a one to one attack essentially\nmano a mano as they say, right.\n\n67\n00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.650\nGuns at dawn walking down the street.\n\n68\n00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:59.090\nIt's a bad actor attempting to take down\none system and to do so in a targeted way.\n\n69\n00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.430\nThey're using some sort of a tool, some\nsort of a mechanism in order to do that.\n\n70\n00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.870\nBut it's their machine against your\ndefensive perimeter essentially.\n\n71\n00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.690\nWe're looking to take out the system or\ncut off access to the service and\n\n72\n00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.660\nas a result, I impact that system or\nthat service negatively.\n\n73\n00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.150\nWhen we think about DOS and\n\n74\n00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.580\nall the service attacks,\nwe think about the lone threat source.\n\n75\n00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.580\nThe lone bad actor sitting\nin a dark room somewhere and\n\n76\n00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.170\nattempting to do or get up to their\nnefarious deeds and get up to no good.\n\n77\n00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.870\nAgainst us as a defender or us as\nan incident responder, whatever it may be.\n\n78\n00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.450\nRemember we stand on the border,\nwe stand on the perimeter of our networks\n\n79\n00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.230\nlooking out for\nthose attacks that are coming in.\n\n80\n00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.870\nNow how do we tell that we're\nhaving DOS activity or traffic.\n\n81\n00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.880\nThere may be a variety of warning signs.\n\n82\n00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.990\nWe may have intrusion detection systems,\nIDSes, we may have firewall and\n\n83\n00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.470\nrouter monitoring capabilities that\nare gonna alert us in some way.\n\n84\n00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.230\nWe may be using a SIEMS, the Security\nInformation Event Management System\n\n85\n00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.830\nthat's aggregating login, bringing it back\nto essential solutions somewhere behind\n\n86\n00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.140\nthe perimeter, for defense, and allowing\nus to interact with that in almost near or\n\n87\n00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.290\nnear real time looking at dashboards,\nheads up displays.\n\n88\n00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.220\nThings like that.\n\n89\n00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.690\nProducts like Solar Winds,\n\n90\n00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.200\nthe Orion product from Solar Winds or,\nwhat do we have.\n\n91\n00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.870\nWe have Mandian's Fire Eye product.\n\n92\n00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.350\nWe have Mandia's.\n\n93\n00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.590\n&gt;&gt; SpiceWorks.\n\n94\n00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:28.680\nNagios is now on.\n\n95\n00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.640\n&gt;&gt; Nagios.\n\n96\n00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.200\nYou got a whole bunch of\nthese different ones.\n\n97\n00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.010\nThere's all these different parameter\nmonitoring platforms, especially given\n\n98\n00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.860\nthe nature of distributive architecture,\nCloud, and virtual environments today.\n\n99\n00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.370\nGot all sorts of different stuff.\n\n100\n00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.730\nWhatever we may be using there.\n\n101\n00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.390\nThe idea is when they find it\nby doing that, but in addition,\n\n102\n00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.380\nwe may just find localized evidence\nof it on the machines being targeted.\n\n103\n00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.610\nMaybe there has been an attempt\nto re-write the firewall rules,\n\n104\n00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.310\nopening or\nblocking certain kinds of traffic.\n\n105\n00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.830\nMaybe there's been a malware attack and\nwe've got a rootkit or\n\n106\n00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.510\na trojan or some sort of malware of\nsome kind being inserted on the system.\n\n107\n00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.410\nAnd maybe our malware screen or\nAV screen has picked them up.\n\n108\n00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.570\nOr perhaps it hasn't depending on how\nyou'll obviously under the radar so\n\n109\n00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.390\nto speak that malware has been inserted.\n\n110\n00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.580\nWe may have a rat or remote access trojan\nthat backdoor that's system and we may or\n\n111\n00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.670\nmay not realize that.\n\n112\n00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.170\nBut you know we can do something\nas simple as running net stat\n\n113\n00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.240\non the machine to be able to understand\nwhether or not we have open ports.\n\n114\n00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.170\nAs matter of fact, if we could,\nlet's just stop come over here for\n\n115\n00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:31.410\na second if you don't mind.\n\n116\n00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.750\nTake a look at my machine, we're quickly\ndo a little real time demonstration.\n\n117\n00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.050\nTotally off the cuff here.\n\n118\n00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.380\nI've got a few things running, and\nas I said, we'll get into some of these.\n\n119\n00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:42.730\nYou can see some icons down here,\n\n120\n00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.090\nyou may realise that little shark fin down\nthere, doing a little Wireshark capture.\n\n121\n00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.170\nFor those of you from the old school,\nthe ethereal capture.\n\n122\n00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:52.650\nI prefer ethereal personally.\n\n123\n00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.070\nRight, I'm gonna go for this sexy cool,\nWireshark kind of names.\n\n124\n00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.340\nBut Wireshark was a product that was\ncalled ethereal back in the day.\n\n125\n00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.540\nIt's been rebranded.\n\n126\n00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.080\nYou can see I've got Zenmap running,\n\n127\n00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.190\nwe'll get to that in a while,\nNMaps windows port.\n\n128\n00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.560\nI've got ngrep running in a command\nline there, we'll take a look at that.\n\n129\n00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.520\nAnd I've got as running in\nthe Cloud right now, doing a scan.\n\n130\n00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.020\nWe'll take a look at some\nof the output of that.\n\n131\n00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.990\nThat's all, you know obviously,\njust straightforward stuff but\n\n132\n00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.330\nwhat we're going to do as well is.\n\n133\n00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.470\nI'm going to go in and open up another\ncommand prompt here real quick so\n\n134\n00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.910\njust bear with me here for\none second while I do that.\n\n135\n00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:25.600\nLet me open up my accessories.\n\n136\n00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.100\nLet me go in.\n\n137\n00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:32.050\nLet's run that as an administrator cuz it\nis Windows after all and why would we give\n\n138\n00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.907\npeople administrative rights out of\nthe box cuz that makes no sense.\n\n139\n00:06:35.907 --> 00:06:38.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Although it makes life a lot easier for\n\n140\n00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.348\neverybody when we do.\n\n141\n00:06:39.348 --> 00:06:42.600\nWhat we see is I've got a lot of traffic\ncoming in and out of this machine.\n\n142\n00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.550\nI'm actively scanning,\nI'm running stuff against the web.\n\n143\n00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.550\nI'm capturing and looking at all that.\n\n144\n00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:48.710\nBut if I was looking for\n\n145\n00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:53.670\nevidence, tell-tale signs, of some\nsort of remote access Trojan activity.\n\n146\n00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.270\nI don't need all this fancy\nsoftware that captures all that.\n\n147\n00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.740\nI don't need no stinking\nbadges as they say.\n\n148\n00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.140\nAll we need is the knowledge\nof networking and\n\n149\n00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.760\nthe basic network stack in any machine.\n\n150\n00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.630\nNot just in Windows but\nthere's an equivalent of a tool like this\n\n151\n00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.940\nthat runs on almost every\noperating system on the planet.\n\n152\n00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:14.640\nWe can go in and look at Netstat and\nwe can go in and\n\n153\n00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:19.200\nwe can take a look at our adapter and\nwe can see what kind of connections\n\n154\n00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.470\nare coming in and out inbound and\noutbound on what protocols,\n\n155\n00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:27.100\non what address with what ports as you\ncan see trying to be developed here.\n\n156\n00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.740\nStandard stuff, and then we can\nsee where they're coming from and\n\n157\n00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.560\nwe can see what kind of state they're in.\n\n158\n00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.720\nIf I run through this and\nI start to see some strange ports,\n\n159\n00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:41.240\nlike 59,000 or whatever the case may be,\n59, 300, whatever.\n\n160\n00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.470\nAnd I'm looking at that going,\nwell, what would that be.\n\n161\n00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:44.670\nI'm not quite sure.\n\n162\n00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:49.470\nDon't know why I'm running that on TCP or\nUDP as you can see at the bottom there.\n\n163\n00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:53.110\nI would not have a complete indication\nauthoritatively beyond a reasonable\n\n164\n00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:53.820\ndoubt to what that is.\n\n165\n00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.561\nBut I have a beginning point to\nstart my investigation from.\n\n166\n00:07:56.561 --> 00:08:00.738\nAnd so, it could be something as simple as\njust running NetStat on a local machine to\n\n167\n00:08:00.738 --> 00:08:02.902\nget a quick peek at\nwhats going on in there.\n\n168\n00:08:02.902 --> 00:08:05.172\nWouldn't necessarily take more than that,\n\n169\n00:08:05.172 --> 00:08:08.576\nI could run other software that\nwould profile the machines, ccan,\n\n170\n00:08:08.576 --> 00:08:13.240\nlook for open ports, do things like that,\nNMAP, and Zen Map, it's Windows port.\n\n171\n00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.310\nEssentially, we do\nthe same thing as Netstat,\n\n172\n00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:18.107\nbut they do it with additional parameters,\ncapabilities, and\n\n173\n00:08:18.107 --> 00:08:21.237\nGUI interface that gives you more depth,\ngives you more information.\n\n174\n00:08:21.237 --> 00:08:25.655\nBut one of the main components of the scan\nis, essentially running nets data under\n\n175\n00:08:25.655 --> 00:08:29.940\nthe hood to get that port protocol,\nand address inbound outbound map.\n\n176\n00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:34.300\nAll network scanners, whether it's\nWireshark, whether it's Network Chemistry,\n\n177\n00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:36.210\none of my favorite ones that I use.\n\n178\n00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:40.480\nWhatever it may be, all of them are\nessentially gathering this traffic, and\n\n179\n00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.430\nlooking at it.\n\n180\n00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:44.640\nSo we're getting this information\nfrom a variety of sources.\n\n181\n00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.410\nThe question is are we aware of it,\ndo we understand the telltale signs, and\n\n182\n00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:51.740\ncan we look at that information and\nsee what's there?\n\n183\n00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.510\nNow depending on the nature of the attack,\nright, we may or\n\n184\n00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.160\nmay not be able to tell\nsomething from this.\n\n185\n00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.790\nBut if we're seeing a huge\namount of bandwidth being\n\n186\n00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.220\nLaunched either out of this machine\nthrough outbound traffic or\n\n187\n00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:07.020\na huge amount being thrown against this\nmachine inbound to deny a service.\n\n188\n00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:11.210\nThen we would see evidence of that using a\ntool like this, we may go into the Windows\n\n189\n00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:15.170\nfirewall, and look for crazy rules that\nhave been added or somehow modified.\n\n190\n00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:18.950\nAnd that would, again be unique to\nthe individual operating system.\n\n191\n00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:20.249\nCould we do the same thing in Linux?\n\n192\n00:09:20.249 --> 00:09:23.991\nYeah, you go to the Linux-based firewall,\nwhether it's old school IP tables and\n\n193\n00:09:23.991 --> 00:09:27.320\nIP chains looking at that stuff,\nwe'll talk a bit about that later.\n\n194\n00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.490\nWhether it's a newer derivative of\nsome of the new firewalls you may use,\n\n195\n00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:33.750\nwhatever it may be, can you go in and\nlook for rule sets and\n\n196\n00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:35.190\nperhaps see modification in there?\n\n197\n00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:36.140\nOf course you could, right?\n\n198\n00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:37.740\nIt wouldn't be hard to do,\nwe could go in here,\n\n199\n00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:41.400\nwe could go to the control panel\nin the case of Windows 7, right?\n\n200\n00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.722\nWe could go in, go down to the bottom\nhere, go to the Windows firewall,\n\n201\n00:09:45.722 --> 00:09:48.183\nthe equivalent of it what ever it may be.\n\n202\n00:09:48.183 --> 00:09:50.443\nYou'll see that the fire\nwall's turned off right now,\n\n203\n00:09:50.443 --> 00:09:52.790\nthat may be a tell tale sign\nin of it's self, right?\n\n204\n00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:55.030\nNow I've gone ahead and\ndropped the firewall down for\n\n205\n00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:58.510\ndemonstration purposes so that we\ncan run scans and things like that.\n\n206\n00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:01.870\nWe can do pinging and you know do a lot\nof stuff we would normally want to do\n\n207\n00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:05.140\nto show you things that would be\nblocked by default by a firewall,\n\n208\n00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:07.110\nso that's expected behavior.\n\n209\n00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:11.760\nBut if you go in and find a firewall that\nsupposed to be running in a disabled\n\n210\n00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:16.490\nstate, that is as we say in the trade,\na hit and a half for you, right?\n\n211\n00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:21.140\nIf you don't understand at that point that\nthere's something significantly different,\n\n212\n00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.880\nthen there was the last time\nyou check on this machine,\n\n213\n00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.780\nyou've chosen the wrong\nline of work my friend.\n\n214\n00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:30.280\nYou need to really reevaluate your career\noptions as an IT professional, and\n\n215\n00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.750\ndealing with incident handling, because\nyou're missing the most obvious clue,\n\n216\n00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.540\nthe one that's just\nstaring you in the face.\n\n217\n00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:36.750\nSomebody's disabled the firewall.\n\n218\n00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:41.090\nAnd not somebody, something that was\nlaunched by somebody most likely malware,\n\n219\n00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.880\nthat either remoted in,\nopened up a backdoor,\n\n220\n00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.220\nallowed the attacker to get\nin purposely disable this, or\n\n221\n00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:50.940\nlaunch malware itself as a rootkit or\nsome derivative of that.\n\n222\n00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.820\nThrough a trojan or some sort of a bot or\n\n223\n00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:57.000\nwhatever it may be,\nthat as part of it's insidious\n\n224\n00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:01.310\nintegration into the system essentially\nturned off your firewall, right?\n\n225\n00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:04.190\nSo this may in and\nof itself be the most obvious sign.\n\n226\n00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:08.700\nWe often say, hiding in plain sight is the\nbest way, right, to be able to essentially\n\n227\n00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.970\ndo something, cuz everybody looks,\nhe goes it can't be that obvious, right?\n\n228\n00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.640\nFirewall's off, come on,\nthat can't be that.\n\n229\n00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.752\n&gt;&gt; The firewall could be on, but\nyou have to go in, look at the rules,\n\n230\n00:11:17.752 --> 00:11:20.043\nmaybe there's a crazy\nrule that's not locked.\n\n231\n00:11:20.043 --> 00:11:22.470\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so we're gonna take\na look at that right now, right?\n\n232\n00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:25.550\nSo if we go in and we wanna go in and\nactually take a look, right?\n\n233\n00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:26.266\nWe could go in.\n\n234\n00:11:28.634 --> 00:11:32.394\nAnd give it just a second here,\nthere we go, and\n\n235\n00:11:32.394 --> 00:11:36.460\nwe just gotta bring up\nthe firewall interface.\n\n236\n00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:40.070\nSo go to Advanced Settings in Windows,\nat least in Windows 7, anyway, we go and\n\n237\n00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:41.880\ngo to Advance Settings, so\nI'm not gonna turn it on.\n\n238\n00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.610\nBut as you said,\nI wanna see the rules, right?\n\n239\n00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:44.990\nSo we're gonna go over and take a look,\n\n240\n00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:47.140\nwe have inbound rules,\nwe have outbound rules, right?\n\n241\n00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:50.430\nSo it's important to understand that\nrules may be unidirectional, right?\n\n242\n00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:52.770\nThey're not necessarily bidirectional and\nby design and\n\n243\n00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:54.520\nby default they're normally not.\n\n244\n00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:59.330\nWe may choose to create a bidirectional\nrule path because we wanna allow\n\n245\n00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.590\ntraffic inbound and outbound under\nthe same protocol, and port set for\n\n246\n00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:04.750\ncertain things like web traffic,\nfor instance.\n\n247\n00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.490\nSo we may have the option to do that, but\n\n248\n00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:11.030\na lot of times, we may only allow traffic\ninbound under certain conditions, and\n\n249\n00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:13.620\noutbounded going the other way\nunder different conditions.\n\n250\n00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:16.245\nSo we may very well see\ndifferent sets rules, so\n\n251\n00:12:16.245 --> 00:12:17.875\nwe gotta think about that, right?\n\n252\n00:12:17.875 --> 00:12:18.385\nSo we may go and\n\n253\n00:12:18.385 --> 00:12:22.015\nwe may take a look at the inbound rules,\nwe'll see there are quite a few of them.\n\n254\n00:12:22.015 --> 00:12:24.475\nNow in Windows in particular\nadd many firewalls,\n\n255\n00:12:24.475 --> 00:12:28.225\ndepends on the nature of the interface but\nit's usually fairly standardize.\n\n256\n00:12:28.225 --> 00:12:32.205\nThe green circle with the white check\ntends indicate rules on inactive,\n\n257\n00:12:32.205 --> 00:12:34.836\nasterisks assuming of course\nfirewall is turned on, right?\n\n258\n00:12:34.836 --> 00:12:35.482\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In our case,\n\n259\n00:12:35.482 --> 00:12:39.106\nwe have active rules that would be\navailable if the firewall is enables but\n\n260\n00:12:39.106 --> 00:12:39.640\nclearly.\n\n261\n00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.790\nThey're not running right now,\ncause firewall itself is turned off, but\n\n262\n00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:45.950\nwe also see we have a gray\ncircle of some kind,\n\n263\n00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:50.740\nwith a white check, that indicates\nthe rule that is not turned on.\n\n264\n00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.100\nSo even if we enable the firewall,\nthat rule will not be active,\n\n265\n00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.960\nnow we have a handy little column here,\nwe can CSRT by, or\n\n266\n00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.850\nCSRT by, we could sort by,\nor CSRT by, either way.\n\n267\n00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:01.770\nAnd so as a result we could\nsearch very easily here, and\n\n268\n00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:04.110\nsee what rules are not turned on or are.\n\n269\n00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:07.050\nWe may find the rules that should\nbe turned on have been turned off,\n\n270\n00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:09.850\nwe may find rules that have been\nmodified and have been added in.\n\n271\n00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:13.170\nYeah, the one thing that I don't care for\nparticularly, in this.\n\n272\n00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:17.700\nLet me just scroll over here so we can\nsee, that I don't particularly care for\n\n273\n00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.850\nin our interface here,\nwe have a lot of information.\n\n274\n00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:22.490\nWe have protocol port,\nremote port etc, but\n\n275\n00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:25.600\nthe one thing that we dont see here and\nyou'll see,\n\n276\n00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.720\nyou may or may not be able to tell,\nI'm right clicking but it's hard to see.\n\n277\n00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:33.230\nSo let me go here to view and\nlet's go to add remove columns, right.\n\n278\n00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:36.230\nNow the one thing I dont care for\nby default are in the views,\n\n279\n00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:39.680\nthe fact that we dont have an ability and\nyou'll look and see that,\n\n280\n00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:43.810\neven if we had it in, we dont have an\nability to see when the rule was created.\n\n281\n00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:46.720\nThere is no data timestamp\non rule creation\n\n282\n00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.430\nthat would give us an easy\nindication in a way,\n\n283\n00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:53.090\nto understand of rules have been added at\na certain point in time in the interface.\n\n284\n00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:55.290\nSo I don't really care for that, and\n\n285\n00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:57.860\nthat particular way in which\nthis is handled in Windows.\n\n286\n00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.040\nThat's just me but\nI would wanna see that and\n\n287\n00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:04.230\nwanna know that, because that\nwould allow us to be able to tell\n\n288\n00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:07.710\nthat something's been modified in\na certain reasonable period of time.\n\n289\n00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:10.830\nNow can I go to the log for\nthe firewall and find that information?\n\n290\n00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:11.780\nSure I can, but\n\n291\n00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:15.400\nit would be nice if I was able to\nexpose it here is all I'm suggesting.\n\n292\n00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:19.180\nSo while this is not a hey what\nfeatures would you change session for\n\n293\n00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:22.790\nWindows, but given the opportunity,\nyou always want to throw it out there.\n\n294\n00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:24.440\nYou never know who may be listening\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n295\n00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:27.424\n&gt;&gt; Somebody who's in charge of\nfirewalls may catch this and\n\n296\n00:14:27.424 --> 00:14:28.927\nsay that is an awesome idea.\n\n297\n00:14:28.927 --> 00:14:30.571\n&gt;&gt; We should do that.\n\n298\n00:14:30.571 --> 00:14:32.070\n&gt;&gt; We should do that and\nwe should go do that right now.\n\n299\n00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:35.010\nAnd if they do do that by the way and\nyou are that person, please email me and\n\n300\n00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:37.860\nlet me know so that I know that you did,\nthat would be great.\n\n301\n00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:41.090\nBut you could see that we\ncan modify the view here and\n\n302\n00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:44.190\nwe do wanna understand that and\nknow that that may be yet another way.\n\n303\n00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:46.320\nNow could we look at\nconnection security rules?\n\n304\n00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.040\nWe may have those, they're not set up,\n\n305\n00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:52.600\nwe may have the ability to specify inbound\nfrom this IP, inbound on this port,\n\n306\n00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.610\ninbound from this protocol,\noutbound same way, right?\n\n307\n00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:58.540\nWe could do something like that,\nwe can look at monitoring, right?\n\n308\n00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:01.970\nWe can look at the firewall itself, we\ncould look at connection security rules,\n\n309\n00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:04.250\nwe do have in-depth tools\nthat are available here.\n\n310\n00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:07.580\nNot to mention what we can do from\nthe command line with PowerShell and\n\n311\n00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.260\nsome of the, now the scripting\nlanguage capability that we have but\n\n312\n00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.510\njust in general,\nfrom a command line, right?\n\n313\n00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:17.640\nSo there's a lot of things that we could\ndo that would give us information and\n\n314\n00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.930\nhelp us to better understand\nsome of the tell-tale signs\n\n315\n00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.380\nthat may be warning us that\nsomething is happening here.\n\n316\n00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:27.840\nAgain, we'd have to think about that,\nhave to know that, but a attack may on\n\n317\n00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:33.160\nthe surface not necessarily bubble up\nimmediately and, flash and set off warning\n\n318\n00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.510\nlights and bells and whistles, even DDOS,\ndistributed denial of service attack.\n\n319\n00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:39.790\nIt may not set off those\nalarm bells right away but\n\n320\n00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:41.750\nwe have to be ever vigilant, right?\n\n321\n00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:44.950\nEver looking for those opportunities\nto understand what's happening.\n\n322\n00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:49.390\nIf we see there's a slowdown in\nthe general operational environment\n\n323\n00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:51.850\nthat could lead to all sorts\nof questions on our behalf.\n\n324\n00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:56.977\nSomething as simple as figuring out,\nright, that we may have\n\n325\n00:15:56.977 --> 00:16:02.707\na issue that we have to take a look\nat from a performance perspective.\n\n326\n00:16:02.707 --> 00:16:06.892\nOne of the most underrated and\nundervalued, and yet most valuable tools\n\n327\n00:16:06.892 --> 00:16:11.019\nIn the arsenal for the incident handler,\nthat's on a Windows system.\n\n328\n00:16:11.019 --> 00:16:13.660\nIt's task manager, people just\noverlook this tool all the time.\n\n329\n00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:14.800\nDon't think about it.\n\n330\n00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.169\nDon't say well, I could learn so\nmuch from that, let me take a look.\n\n331\n00:16:18.169 --> 00:16:21.546\nBut the reality is, this is one of\nthe most valuable tools you have.\n\n332\n00:16:21.546 --> 00:16:26.099\nNow, can you use command line versions\nthis strong let's say, the SYS internals,\n\n333\n00:16:26.099 --> 00:16:27.459\nWIN internals tool set?\n\n334\n00:16:27.459 --> 00:16:28.960\nPS List for instance, autoruns.\n\n335\n00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:32.166\nThere's lots of different options,\nright, to get to this.\n\n336\n00:16:32.166 --> 00:16:35.159\nCan you do some Linux units with top and\nproc and list?\n\n337\n00:16:35.159 --> 00:16:36.369\nAbsolutely, right?\n\n338\n00:16:36.369 --> 00:16:37.824\nI mean, you can get this information.\n\n339\n00:16:37.824 --> 00:16:39.323\nThis is not unique to Windows.\n\n340\n00:16:39.323 --> 00:16:41.698\nYou should be able to do this on\nany operating system on the planet.\n\n341\n00:16:41.698 --> 00:16:45.892\nBut my point is, that looking at what's\ncurrently running and understanding what's\n\n342\n00:16:45.892 --> 00:16:49.730\nthere, is such a valuable thought\nprocess for us as incident handlers.\n\n343\n00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:53.726\nBecause we are gonna get a snapshot\nas to what may be going on.\n\n344\n00:16:53.726 --> 00:16:57.329\nNow, having said that, right, before\neverybody gets up in arms out there and\n\n345\n00:16:57.329 --> 00:16:59.305\nsays okay, Adam, yeah that's awesome.\n\n346\n00:16:59.305 --> 00:17:01.500\nBut what about all the stuff that stealths\nitself that doesn't show up in the GUI?\n\n347\n00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:04.520\nWhat about all the root kits that\nare there but you don't see?\n\n348\n00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:05.512\nAbsolutely, I get all that.\n\n349\n00:17:05.512 --> 00:17:06.176\nI know that.\n\n350\n00:17:06.176 --> 00:17:10.092\nYou're not gonna get 100% accurate\npicture of every process that's running.\n\n351\n00:17:10.092 --> 00:17:12.288\nI know that, and\nI know you know that as well.\n\n352\n00:17:12.288 --> 00:17:16.926\nBut what I'm suggesting is that there\nis an opportunity to get a baseline and\n\n353\n00:17:16.926 --> 00:17:18.890\nsee if something is wrong here.\n\n354\n00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:23.159\nAnd we should never avoid or underestimate\nthe value of all the different pieces\n\n355\n00:17:23.159 --> 00:17:25.963\nof information that we can\nuse to cross reference and\n\n356\n00:17:25.963 --> 00:17:28.720\ncorrelate what the current\nstate of the system is.\n\n357\n00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:33.639\nBecause the more data points we have, the\nmore ability to understand from different\n\n358\n00:17:33.639 --> 00:17:37.220\nperspectives what’s happening\nwe bring to the table.\n\n359\n00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:41.225\nThe more likely it is that our mechanism\nfor understanding, interpreting and\n\n360\n00:17:41.225 --> 00:17:45.118\nanalyzing that data and the results of\nthat, are going to be more accurate.\n\n361\n00:17:45.118 --> 00:17:49.005\nAnd so we should never overlook the most\nobvious things, not because they're not\n\n362\n00:17:49.005 --> 00:17:52.980\nvaluable, not because they're not obvious,\nnot because they're not there.\n\n363\n00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.330\nWe should use them for\nthose exact reasons, right?\n\n364\n00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:58.494\nAnd we tend to, I hear this a lot\nfrom security professionals.\n\n365\n00:17:58.494 --> 00:18:00.252\nYeah, I don't need to bother with that.\n\n366\n00:18:00.252 --> 00:18:03.005\nI got this $10,000 tool\nthat we use all the time.\n\n367\n00:18:03.005 --> 00:18:06.402\nLet me hook this thing up and\nlet's go ahead and diagnose your system.\n\n368\n00:18:06.402 --> 00:18:09.093\nTwo hours later I'm still waiting for\na report on what's running, right?\n\n369\n00:18:09.093 --> 00:18:14.034\nSometimes simple and\nsimplicity is the best approach, right?\n\n370\n00:18:14.034 --> 00:18:16.423\nIt doesn't have to be\ncomplicated to be good,\n\n371\n00:18:16.423 --> 00:18:18.769\nit just has to tell you\nwhat you what you need.\n\n372\n00:18:18.769 --> 00:18:21.394\nAnd just because something doesn't\ncost money doesn't mean you\n\n373\n00:18:21.394 --> 00:18:23.500\nlook down your nose at it and\nsay it's not valuable.\n\n374\n00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:27.973\n&gt;&gt; It is very interesting at how effective\nyou can be at diagnosing problems,\n\n375\n00:18:27.973 --> 00:18:29.043\nfinding issues.\n\n376\n00:18:29.043 --> 00:18:32.457\nIf you're just really good at using\nthe tools that are already built into your\n\n377\n00:18:32.457 --> 00:18:33.580\noperating system.\n\n378\n00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:34.797\nThere's a myriad and\n\n379\n00:18:34.797 --> 00:18:39.198\na plethora of different tools that you\ncan definitely discover many things.\n\n380\n00:18:39.198 --> 00:18:42.545\nAnd just, you just kinda have to\nbundle it together, get a process for\n\n381\n00:18:42.545 --> 00:18:44.240\nfinding those things out.\n\n382\n00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:48.063\nAnd then you'll, I did it every day for\neight years as a systems administrator.\n\n383\n00:18:48.063 --> 00:18:49.599\nIt was very helpful.\n\n384\n00:18:49.599 --> 00:18:51.007\n&gt;&gt; No doubt about it, right?\n\n385\n00:18:51.007 --> 00:18:52.710\nI mean, when you look at this you say,\n\n386\n00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:54.904\nokay I have multiple\nChrome processes running.\n\n387\n00:18:54.904 --> 00:18:56.736\nClearly, right,\ngiven what I'm doing, right?\n\n388\n00:18:56.736 --> 00:18:59.101\nBut something as simple\nas open file location.\n\n389\n00:18:59.101 --> 00:19:01.140\nHey, take me to where that process is.\n\n390\n00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.021\nWhat is that folder all of a sudden's\ndoing there it was never there\n\n391\n00:19:04.021 --> 00:19:04.802\nbefore, right?\n\n392\n00:19:04.802 --> 00:19:07.332\nWhat about ending the process or\nthe process tree.\n\n393\n00:19:07.332 --> 00:19:11.616\nAgain, malware that's really been\narchitected to do this the right way is\n\n394\n00:19:11.616 --> 00:19:13.867\nnot gonna show up here traditionally.\n\n395\n00:19:13.867 --> 00:19:16.027\nOr it's gonna show up\nunder its stealth name and\n\n396\n00:19:16.027 --> 00:19:19.537\nyou are not gonna potentially realize\nthat one of those five chrome instances\n\n397\n00:19:19.537 --> 00:19:21.324\nactually is malware running, right?\n\n398\n00:19:21.324 --> 00:19:24.305\nBut my point is you would still\nwanna do an investigation here.\n\n399\n00:19:24.305 --> 00:19:25.931\nCreate a dump file, see what's going on.\n\n400\n00:19:25.931 --> 00:19:26.803\nLook at priority.\n\n401\n00:19:26.803 --> 00:19:28.885\nGo to services, see what it's attached to.\n\n402\n00:19:28.885 --> 00:19:31.831\nThere's lots of ways for\nyou to leverage this information.\n\n403\n00:19:31.831 --> 00:19:35.079\nOne that a lot of people don't realize\nthey could do as well is bring up\n\n404\n00:19:35.079 --> 00:19:38.775\nthe properties of whatever's running\nthis thing, and just take a look at it.\n\n405\n00:19:38.775 --> 00:19:40.190\nIs it something you're familiar with?\n\n406\n00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:41.313\nDo you know where it's from?\n\n407\n00:19:41.313 --> 00:19:44.597\nDo you know, and again, can we get\nto when it was installed and where?\n\n408\n00:19:44.597 --> 00:19:46.258\nYeah, we get that right here.\n\n409\n00:19:46.258 --> 00:19:47.763\nNow, can that information be modified?\n\n410\n00:19:47.763 --> 00:19:49.136\nYeah, that can be modified.\n\n411\n00:19:49.136 --> 00:19:51.090\nThat's not accurate all the time.\n\n412\n00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:54.947\nYou gotta look at this with a jaundiced\neye, a grain of salt, right,\n\n413\n00:19:54.947 --> 00:19:56.085\nin the wound there.\n\n414\n00:19:56.085 --> 00:19:57.577\nYou gotta be a little bit skeptical.\n\n415\n00:19:57.577 --> 00:19:59.524\nBut that doesn't mean we\nignore what you find.\n\n416\n00:19:59.524 --> 00:20:05.042\nIt just means that we've gotta\nunderstand that this is one datapoint.\n\n417\n00:20:05.042 --> 00:20:06.737\nOne piece of the puzzle.\n\n418\n00:20:06.737 --> 00:20:09.695\nBut without this, and\nthen cross referencing this with three or\n\n419\n00:20:09.695 --> 00:20:10.639\nfour other things.\n\n420\n00:20:10.639 --> 00:20:15.230\nIt's impossible to say definitively\nwhether that chrome.exe executable is\n\n421\n00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:16.417\nlegitimate or not.\n\n422\n00:20:16.417 --> 00:20:21.168\nOr whether it's sitting in the C program\nfiles x86 Google Chrome etc., etc., path,\n\n423\n00:20:21.168 --> 00:20:23.117\nwhether that's legitimate or not.\n\n424\n00:20:23.117 --> 00:20:26.423\nNow could I do the right thing,\ngo out and either know that,\n\n425\n00:20:26.423 --> 00:20:29.016\ncheck that on another\nmachine as a reference?\n\n426\n00:20:29.016 --> 00:20:31.424\nGo to [LAUGH] Google Google, right?\n\n427\n00:20:31.424 --> 00:20:32.419\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n428\n00:20:32.419 --> 00:20:35.234\n&gt;&gt; Could I go to Google Google and\nsee what their install path is?\n\n429\n00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:36.890\nYou could do all these things.\n\n430\n00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:38.827\nAre you thinking about that\nas an incident handler?\n\n431\n00:20:38.827 --> 00:20:39.784\nI don't know.\n\n432\n00:20:39.784 --> 00:20:41.351\nI'm thinking about that, right?\n\n433\n00:20:41.351 --> 00:20:44.915\nI know Daniel's thinking about that but\nwe're the ones that are helping you to\n\n434\n00:20:44.915 --> 00:20:47.780\nunderstand that you should be\nthinking about it, is my point.\n\n435\n00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.437\nAnd if you're doing this, good for\n\n436\n00:20:49.437 --> 00:20:51.933\nyou because this is exactly\nwhat you need to be doing.\n\n437\n00:20:51.933 --> 00:20:55.330\nIf you're not, that's okay but\nwhy haven't you started?\n\n438\n00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:58.894\nAnd you should be doing it, going forward,\nbecause this is the exact methodology\n\n439\n00:20:58.894 --> 00:21:01.644\nthat's gonna help you to get out\nof the gate and be successful.\n\n440\n00:21:01.644 --> 00:21:03.273\nNow, is this the only thing you gotta do?\n\n441\n00:21:03.273 --> 00:21:05.386\nNo, you need those expensive tools,\nin some cases.\n\n442\n00:21:05.386 --> 00:21:08.164\nYou need to go through five or\nsix different iterations.\n\n443\n00:21:08.164 --> 00:21:10.612\nYou gotta look at a bunch\nof different stuff.\n\n444\n00:21:10.612 --> 00:21:14.360\nBut this is the starting point,\nthis is the stuff that helps to filter and\n\n445\n00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:18.610\neliminate the obvious things that are okay\nand the obvious things that are wrong.\n\n446\n00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:23.870\nAnd then from there, you zero in on\nthe stuff that looks of interest to you,\n\n447\n00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:27.780\nand may or may not be something that\nis representing itself the right way.\n\n448\n00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.827\nOr it is not representing\nitself the right way, right?\n\n449\n00:21:29.827 --> 00:21:34.360\nSo don't underestimate the value,\nthe power of the free, and the built in,\n\n450\n00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:35.351\nas Daniel said.\n\n451\n00:21:35.351 --> 00:21:37.677\nThe plethora and the myriad,\nI like that a lot.\n\n452\n00:21:37.677 --> 00:21:39.372\nGood SAT vocabulary.\n\n453\n00:21:39.372 --> 00:21:43.986\nWe could bill this as not only certified\nincident handling but also SAT prep.\n\n454\n00:21:43.986 --> 00:21:45.279\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nhey we're trying to cover-\n\n455\n00:21:45.279 --> 00:21:46.110\n&gt;&gt; It is that time of the year, right?\n\n456\n00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:47.543\n&gt;&gt; Trying to cover all our bases\nhere ladies and gentlemen.\n\n457\n00:21:47.543 --> 00:21:50.768\n&gt;&gt; We are everything to everybody\nhere at ITProTV, boys and girls.\n\n458\n00:21:50.768 --> 00:21:53.877\nEverything to everybody,\nno matter what you need, it is right here.\n\n459\n00:21:53.877 --> 00:21:55.077\n&gt;&gt; For you [LAUGH].\n\n460\n00:21:55.077 --> 00:21:56.819\n&gt;&gt; Daniel and Adam,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n461\n00:21:56.819 --> 00:21:57.859\n&gt;&gt; Right here.\n\n462\n00:21:57.859 --> 00:21:59.225\nAll right, so we're talking\nabout denial of service attacks.\n\n463\n00:21:59.225 --> 00:22:01.554\nDistributed denial of service attacks,\nsame idea, right?\n\n464\n00:22:01.554 --> 00:22:06.431\nExcept that instead of one to one, we're\ntalking about a group of machines simply\n\n465\n00:22:06.431 --> 00:22:10.557\ncalled the botnet these days, or\na set of zombied machines, right?\n\n466\n00:22:10.557 --> 00:22:12.408\nSo, the zombie apocalypse, when it comes,\n\n467\n00:22:12.408 --> 00:22:14.712\nthat's all because of\ndistributed denial of service.\n\n468\n00:22:14.712 --> 00:22:18.812\nRight, so, either a DDoS attack would\ntypically be a group of machines that\n\n469\n00:22:18.812 --> 00:22:20.423\nhave been botted or zombied.\n\n470\n00:22:20.423 --> 00:22:24.563\nOr in some way modified by a bad actor or\nthreat source that's managed to\n\n471\n00:22:24.563 --> 00:22:27.950\nget malware onto them, or\nit's somehow taken them over.\n\n472\n00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:29.534\nAnd it's now using them,\n\n473\n00:22:29.534 --> 00:22:33.136\ncoordinated in some way to\nattack again a single endpoint,\n\n474\n00:22:33.136 --> 00:22:37.920\na single entry point to a network,\na single machine, whatever it may be.\n\n475\n00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:41.580\nSo multiple machines now\nbeing deployed to attack one\n\n476\n00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:44.550\nis a distributed denial of service, right?\n\n477\n00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:48.840\nSo when you see evidence of multiple\ninbound IPs on the firewall,\n\n478\n00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:52.671\non the network scan on,\nthe netstat, whatever it may be.\n\n479\n00:22:52.671 --> 00:22:57.158\nAnd you've got 10, 20, 30, 100,\n1,000 machines sending traffic your way,\n\n480\n00:22:57.158 --> 00:22:59.867\nthat's indicative of\na distributed denial of service.\n\n481\n00:22:59.867 --> 00:23:04.310\nAs opposed to one machine doing that\ncommunication for a denial of service.\n\n482\n00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:06.187\nWhat are some of the ways we\ncan deal with these attacks?\n\n483\n00:23:06.187 --> 00:23:08.144\nCan we absorb them?\n\n484\n00:23:08.144 --> 00:23:11.200\nIn theory,\ndepending on how strong our network is,\n\n485\n00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.290\nwhat about degrading the service?\n\n486\n00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:14.755\nNotifying people there's\ngonna be a slowdown.\n\n487\n00:23:14.755 --> 00:23:17.746\nWe're still gonna try our best but\nwe may not be able to be up to full speed.\n\n488\n00:23:17.746 --> 00:23:18.448\nYou could do that.\n\n489\n00:23:18.448 --> 00:23:19.905\nWhat about shutting down?\n\n490\n00:23:19.905 --> 00:23:23.301\nEssentially throwing in the towel,\nsaying no more email.\n\n491\n00:23:23.301 --> 00:23:26.495\n&gt;&gt; Well then it's basically with\nthe denial of service attack has won\n\n492\n00:23:26.495 --> 00:23:27.245\nat that point.\n\n493\n00:23:27.245 --> 00:23:28.156\nIf we shut down the servers.\n\n494\n00:23:28.156 --> 00:23:30.999\n&gt;&gt; Totally it has, but all I'm saying\nis what response strategies, right?\n\n495\n00:23:30.999 --> 00:23:34.769\nWhen you think about this we often,\nagain, we overlook the obvious, right?\n\n496\n00:23:34.769 --> 00:23:37.570\nWe may have to essentially\nlose in order to win,\n\n497\n00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:40.130\nis what I'm suggesting to you, right?\n\n498\n00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:44.011\nBecause what may have to happen is we may\nhave to shut down for a period of time In\n\n499\n00:23:44.011 --> 00:23:47.375\norder to figure out how to come\nback stronger and avoid the attack.\n\n500\n00:23:47.375 --> 00:23:52.302\nAs opposed to trying to fight the fire in\nreal time and losing ground all the time,\n\n501\n00:23:52.302 --> 00:23:52.814\nright?\n\n502\n00:23:52.814 --> 00:23:58.763\nI mean sometimes it's better to\nessentially declare non-victory, right?\n\n503\n00:23:58.763 --> 00:23:59.842\nSay okay, look, you got me.\n\n504\n00:23:59.842 --> 00:24:03.432\nI gonna off to the corner there,\nlick my wounds, figure it out.\n\n505\n00:24:03.432 --> 00:24:05.630\nBut when I come back, boy,\nyou better watch out.\n\n506\n00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:08.926\nI'm gonna be stronger because\nit's very hard to fight the fire.\n\n507\n00:24:08.926 --> 00:24:13.422\nAnd also, essentially, be able to figure\nout how to maintain system survivability\n\n508\n00:24:13.422 --> 00:24:16.863\nwhile you are actually trying\nto short the defenses sometimes.\n\n509\n00:24:16.863 --> 00:24:18.800\nI'm not saying it is a good or\na bad strategy.\n\n510\n00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:23.092\nI'm just pointing out that sometimes you\nmay have to actually absorb the attack and\n\n511\n00:24:23.092 --> 00:24:25.563\ncontinue working if you\nhave that capability.\n\n512\n00:24:25.563 --> 00:24:27.965\nSometimes you can do that but\nin a limited way.\n\n513\n00:24:27.965 --> 00:24:31.697\nSometimes you can't stop that attack long\nenough to get your head above water long\n\n514\n00:24:31.697 --> 00:24:33.172\nenough to get out from under it.\n\n515\n00:24:33.172 --> 00:24:35.912\nSo you essentially let it happen, right?\n\n516\n00:24:35.912 --> 00:24:39.500\nThey tell you, let it roll over you.\n\n517\n00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:43.090\nAnd then, I don't know if you ever do any\nswimming, those of you who like to swim,\n\n518\n00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:44.200\nif you like surf.\n\n519\n00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.100\nBut if you're out in the ocean, and\nthey tell you if you get stuck in a rip\n\n520\n00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.750\ncurrent, or\nyou're gonna get hit with a huge wave.\n\n521\n00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:51.940\nI mean, they tell you,\nlet it roll over you, go with the current.\n\n522\n00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:53.870\nAnd when you get to\na point where it weakens,\n\n523\n00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:55.155\nwhich it will-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n524\n00:24:55.155 --> 00:24:56.520\n&gt;&gt; Then you're able to swim out of it.\n\n525\n00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:58.340\nSometimes you've just got\nto go with the flow, right.\n\n526\n00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:00.540\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes.\n&gt;&gt; And so that's important too.\n\n527\n00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.740\nSo just relax, take it easy.\n\n528\n00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:03.942\nRight, have a cigar.\n\n529\n00:25:03.942 --> 00:25:05.428\nDrink a Scotch.\n\n530\n00:25:05.428 --> 00:25:06.170\nHave a soda.\n\n531\n00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:07.181\nHave a Fresca.\n\n532\n00:25:07.181 --> 00:25:07.844\nRemember the Fresca?\n\n533\n00:25:07.844 --> 00:25:08.447\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n534\n00:25:08.447 --> 00:25:09.282\n&gt;&gt; You remember Fresca?\n\n535\n00:25:09.282 --> 00:25:10.025\nI love Fresca.\n\n536\n00:25:10.025 --> 00:25:12.000\nIt went away for a long time,\nyou can actually find it again.\n\n537\n00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:12.520\n&gt;&gt; It's back.\n\n538\n00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:13.100\n&gt;&gt; It is back.\n\n539\n00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:16.600\nI don't drink soda, but I remember that\nfondly from when I was a kid growing up.\n\n540\n00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:20.250\nIf you've never had a Fresca, by the way,\nreally awesome great fruit flavored soda.\n\n541\n00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:22.610\nPeople hear that and\nthey're like, that doesn't work.\n\n542\n00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:24.640\nBut it's actually really good,\nbelieve it or not.\n\n543\n00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.440\nAnd so remember DOS, DDOS attacks, right?\n\n544\n00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.040\nWe can block them, we can prevent\nthem doing a variety of things.\n\n545\n00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:33.282\nBut probably the most important thing\nwe need to do here is figure out how to\n\n546\n00:25:33.282 --> 00:25:36.392\nmanage our network access,\nour bandwidth and our gateways, right?\n\n547\n00:25:36.392 --> 00:25:38.747\nWe may have to work\nupstream with our provider.\n\n548\n00:25:38.747 --> 00:25:43.992\nSo the ISP or the CSP, if it's a cloud\nbased system may have to be brought in and\n\n549\n00:25:43.992 --> 00:25:46.033\nwe may have to work with them.\n\n550\n00:25:46.033 --> 00:25:49.367\nBecause they're the ones that could\ndo the filtering upstream and\n\n551\n00:25:49.367 --> 00:25:52.416\nprevent the attack packets from\ngetting in a lot of the time.\n\n552\n00:25:52.416 --> 00:25:55.748\nIf it's just a simple system\nin our network, let's say, and\n\n553\n00:25:55.748 --> 00:25:59.657\nwe're being attacked by another machine\nthat's been taken over by a bad\n\n554\n00:25:59.657 --> 00:26:03.132\nactor inside as an insider threat,\nthat's a different story.\n\n555\n00:26:03.132 --> 00:26:05.373\nThat's essentially something\nwe manage internally.\n\n556\n00:26:05.373 --> 00:26:08.385\nBut if this is inbound traffic\ncoming in from the outside.\n\n557\n00:26:08.385 --> 00:26:10.335\nFrom the web, from the internet,\nfrom the cloud or\n\n558\n00:26:10.335 --> 00:26:12.635\nthrough the cloud,\nthis is something different.\n\n559\n00:26:12.635 --> 00:26:14.055\nWe got to get other people involved,\n\n560\n00:26:14.055 --> 00:26:17.210\nbecause other networks are being\nused to propagate this attack.\n\n561\n00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:19.470\nAnd that's something we've got\nto think about and be aware of.\n\n562\n00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:21.390\nAnd again, as an incident responder,\n\n563\n00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:24.590\nthis is one of the things that we\nhave to think about and understand.\n\n564\n00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:27.500\nHow do we handle the DOS, or DDOS attacks.\n\n565\n00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:28.570\nLots of different things to do,\n\n566\n00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:31.830\nbut firewall configuration\nof the gateway perimeter.\n\n567\n00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:34.260\nGotta make sure we talked about this,\ndemonstrated this, right?\n\n568\n00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:37.625\nMake sure firewalls are programmed\nto block the obvious.\n\n569\n00:26:37.625 --> 00:26:39.290\nDon't allow inbound ping from outside.\n\n570\n00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:40.710\nThere's no good reason for that.\n\n571\n00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:43.000\nI see that all the time.\n\n572\n00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.831\nWe've been doing audit work, not all\nthe time, a lot of people know this now.\n\n573\n00:26:45.831 --> 00:26:48.503\nBut I see enough of it still\nthat it's still prevalent.\n\n574\n00:26:48.503 --> 00:26:53.276\nNo good reason for anybody on the outside\nthat does not directly have an ability to\n\n575\n00:26:53.276 --> 00:26:57.362\nconnect to your network through your\nVPN securely to be pinging you.\n\n576\n00:26:57.362 --> 00:26:58.743\nYou're talking to strangers, right?\n\n577\n00:26:58.743 --> 00:27:02.520\nSo the big stranger danger light should\ncome on when you see that kind of traffic.\n\n578\n00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:07.330\nThere is absolutely zero, zero legitimate\nreasons you can offer me that inbound\n\n579\n00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:11.232\nping from a stranger would be\ntraffic you actually wanna engage.\n\n580\n00:27:11.232 --> 00:27:13.484\nAgain, I'm not talking\nabout a known entity.\n\n581\n00:27:13.484 --> 00:27:16.911\nAnd I'm not talking about a unique\nsituation where you need to diagnose\n\n582\n00:27:16.911 --> 00:27:17.490\na problem.\n\n583\n00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:19.710\nAnd you're working with\nsomebody to do that.\n\n584\n00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:21.360\nThose are known quantities.\n\n585\n00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.800\nThat's something you're engaging in.\n\n586\n00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.420\nThat's not a stranger, right?\n\n587\n00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:27.310\nA stranger drives by and says,\nlet me see what's inside.\n\n588\n00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:28.310\nNo, we don't want that.\n\n589\n00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:30.610\nSo block that traffic.\n\n590\n00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:31.660\nLet me be clear.\n\n591\n00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:33.640\nThere is no good reason.\n\n592\n00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:36.130\nNothing good comes from\ntalking to strangers, right?\n\n593\n00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:37.600\nSo, make sure you're aware of that.\n\n594\n00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.690\nSo, firewall is being used to block that.\n\n595\n00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:43.370\nBorder router's being configured to\neliminate this kind of traffic as well.\n\n596\n00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:45.150\nPrevent amplification attacks.\n\n597\n00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:48.290\nPrevent unknown inbound traffic that\n\n598\n00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:51.100\nis coming in under the guise\nof illegitimate traffic.\n\n599\n00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:53.000\nThere are ways to do these things, right.\n\n600\n00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.071\nYou have to make sure\nyou're aware of that.\n\n601\n00:27:54.071 --> 00:27:58.796\nTraffic flow rates need to be [INAUDIBLE]\nof the ISP upstream has to be has to be\n\n602\n00:27:58.796 --> 00:28:01.199\nable to know that there's a problem.\n\n603\n00:28:01.199 --> 00:28:04.636\nAnd they do, and they may cut back\non inbound traffic as a result.\n\n604\n00:28:04.636 --> 00:28:05.878\nBut you have to work with them and\n\n605\n00:28:05.878 --> 00:28:07.678\nunderstand what those\nparameters look like.\n\n606\n00:28:07.678 --> 00:28:12.233\nWhen they see a tremendous cutaway of\nthe traffic coming down the pipe towards\n\n607\n00:28:12.233 --> 00:28:13.715\nyour inbound public IP.\n\n608\n00:28:13.715 --> 00:28:16.210\nThey're gonna flag that and\nstart monitoring that.\n\n609\n00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:19.360\nAnd if that traffic looks unusual,\nthey're gonna cut it off.\n\n610\n00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.810\nBut you need to understand what\nthose thresholds may look like.\n\n611\n00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:23.340\nSo, you wanna know that.\n\n612\n00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:28.370\nWhat about making sure that we're, again,\nusing IDSIPS software and filtering?\n\n613\n00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:29.630\nWe talk about the fence and\n\n614\n00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:35.460\ndepth in overlapping mutually\nreinforcing layers of protection.\n\n615\n00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:37.010\nEnclaves, protection boundaries,\n\n616\n00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:38.770\nprotection profiles,\nwhatever you want to call it.\n\n617\n00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:40.250\nBut concentric rings, right?\n\n618\n00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:44.880\nThink of essentially a bullseye, but\nthink of a bullseye, then we have five or\n\n619\n00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:45.750\nsix rings.\n\n620\n00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:46.894\nRemember the skee ball?\n\n621\n00:28:46.894 --> 00:28:47.876\nYou ever play skee ball\nwhen you were a kid?\n\n622\n00:28:47.876 --> 00:28:48.973\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So if you remember,\n\n623\n00:28:48.973 --> 00:28:52.168\nif you play skee ball remember the target\nyou would throw the ball up against?\n\n624\n00:28:52.168 --> 00:28:55.279\nYou have the small one in the middle that\nessentially was 100 points or whatever.\n\n625\n00:28:55.279 --> 00:28:58.181\nAnd then you have the outer\nrings where you got to nothing.\n\n626\n00:28:58.181 --> 00:29:01.419\nAnd if you think about that,\nthat's the classic graphic,\n\n627\n00:29:01.419 --> 00:29:03.940\nthe classic example of defense and depth.\n\n628\n00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:06.595\nWe should call it skeet ball\narchitecture instead of defense and\n\n629\n00:29:06.595 --> 00:29:09.556\ndepth because this is what we need,\nthis is what we're talking about.\n\n630\n00:29:09.556 --> 00:29:11.786\nWe're talking about all\nthose protection rings.\n\n631\n00:29:11.786 --> 00:29:14.586\nAnd we know, right, fundamentally.\n\n632\n00:29:14.586 --> 00:29:16.041\nAnd we should know and\nhopefully you do know.\n\n633\n00:29:16.041 --> 00:29:19.909\nThat as threat source, as a bad actor,\nwe're anticipating that one or\n\n634\n00:29:19.909 --> 00:29:23.660\nmore of those rings are gonna be\nbreached as an attack is propagated.\n\n635\n00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:26.539\nThe goal is not to stop\nthe attack at the outer layer.\n\n636\n00:29:26.539 --> 00:29:29.047\nThat's ridiculous, you're never gonna\nbe able to do that all the time.\n\n637\n00:29:29.047 --> 00:29:33.552\nThe goal is to absorb that inbound attack\nwithout the final layer being breached.\n\n638\n00:29:33.552 --> 00:29:37.348\nIf you get five layers deep in a six\nlayer architecture but I stop you.\n\n639\n00:29:37.348 --> 00:29:40.450\nI still declare victory because\nyou have not gotten into\n\n640\n00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:45.070\nthe innermost protected sanctum where all\nthe systems are, what we need, right?\n\n641\n00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:46.670\nI mean that's really what\nwe have to think about.\n\n642\n00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:50.509\nBut, even if you manage to get all\nthe way in, and let's be honest, so\n\n643\n00:29:50.509 --> 00:29:52.410\nlet's be clear about this.\n\n644\n00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:54.040\nAll right, this does happen.\n\n645\n00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:55.830\nYou can breach that inner layer, right.\n\n646\n00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:58.755\nThere are attacks that will just blow past\neverything we put in front if them no\n\n647\n00:29:58.755 --> 00:29:59.301\nmatter what.\n\n648\n00:29:59.301 --> 00:30:02.870\nJust open up the newspaper,\nturn on the news, anywhere in the world,\n\n649\n00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:05.605\nwherever you are listening to us now or\nin the future.\n\n650\n00:30:05.605 --> 00:30:08.226\nAnd take a look at the last 24 hours and\n\n651\n00:30:08.226 --> 00:30:11.630\nGoogle what's happened\nin computer security.\n\n652\n00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:14.285\nYou'd see ample evidence of attacks\nthat are successful all the time\n\n653\n00:30:14.285 --> 00:30:15.410\nwithout fail, right?\n\n654\n00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:18.140\nSo it's not about hey, let's keep\nthe bad people out all the time.\n\n655\n00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.180\nWe know bad people get in, right?\n\n656\n00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:23.220\nBut we don't wanna set a table for them,\ninvite them in and have drinks, right?\n\n657\n00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:25.296\nWe wanna make it as uncomfortable for\nthem as possible.\n\n658\n00:30:25.296 --> 00:30:29.229\nIf I delay you long enough so that\nit's six, seven, eight layers deep and\n\n659\n00:30:29.229 --> 00:30:32.735\nit takes you time to navigate\nthrough all those layers and get in.\n\n660\n00:30:32.735 --> 00:30:36.470\nThe thought process is along the way\nyou're gonna leave evidence behind.\n\n661\n00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:39.440\nI'm gonna see evidence and\ntelltale signs that I'm gonna find you.\n\n662\n00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:44.200\nI'm gonna declare or rather be alerted\nto the fact that this is going on.\n\n663\n00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.920\nI may not stop you,\nI may not stop you this time.\n\n664\n00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:50.270\nBut I'm gonna know you came and went, and\nI'm gonna be there the next time, right?\n\n665\n00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:51.250\nRest assured.\n\n666\n00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:54.800\nSo understand that a deep enough\ndefensive in-depth architecture\n\n667\n00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:57.579\nis critical to our ability to\nbe successful here as well.\n\n668\n00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:01.980\nRestrict all incoming and outgoing\ntraffic that does not need to be there.\n\n669\n00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:04.670\nGet rid of all unnecessary software and\nservices, right?\n\n670\n00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:06.350\nStrip down the boxes, harden them up.\n\n671\n00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:08.510\nWe've talked a lot about\nthis thought process.\n\n672\n00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:12.240\nDevelop containment policies and\nstrategies that include as we said,\n\n673\n00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:15.020\nmultiple layers of counter measures,\nright?\n\n674\n00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:19.400\nSo don't just rely on one border\ngateway device like a firewall.\n\n675\n00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:22.560\nHave a firewall but\nalso have a router that does filtering.\n\n676\n00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:24.490\nHave an IDS and an IPS.\n\n677\n00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:28.550\nHave all sorts of systems that mutually\noverlap and enforce one another.\n\n678\n00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:31.820\nBy doing that we're gonna be able\nto build this defense in depth and\n\n679\n00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:32.920\nthis is what we need to do.\n\n680\n00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:37.220\nAnd by doing these kind of things\nwe're gonna be able to survive.\n\n681\n00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:39.690\nAnd ultimately absorb these\ninbound attacks when they occur,\n\n682\n00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:42.200\nand then if necessary, respond in kind.\n\n683\n00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:42.830\nWe may or may not.\n\n684\n00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:45.124\nThat's a conversation for\nanother day, not for now.\n\n685\n00:31:45.124 --> 00:31:48.392\nBut whatever we do,\nwe're gonna be able to respond and\n\n686\n00:31:48.392 --> 00:31:51.741\nunderstand how to respond\nfrom a position of strength.\n\n687\n00:31:51.741 --> 00:31:54.822\nCuz we have knowledge,\nwe understand what's going on as a result,\n\n688\n00:31:54.822 --> 00:31:55.640\nvery important.\n\n689\n00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:58.227\n&gt;&gt; Denial of service attacks are a nasty,\nnasty thing and\n\n690\n00:31:58.227 --> 00:32:01.839\nthey're something that like you have\nsaid are very common unfortunately.\n\n691\n00:32:01.839 --> 00:32:04.922\nSo we have to be able to assess them,\nsee them happening,\n\n692\n00:32:04.922 --> 00:32:06.738\nknow what it is that causes them.\n\n693\n00:32:06.738 --> 00:32:10.465\nAnd then how to prevent\nthese things from occurring.\n\n694\n00:32:10.465 --> 00:32:13.657\nAdam, we thank you for\nreminding us of this or\n\n695\n00:32:13.657 --> 00:32:16.755\ninforming us of this if we are unaware.\n\n696\n00:32:16.755 --> 00:32:20.175\nThat being said, I know we've got more\nto cover but we are well out of time for\n\n697\n00:32:20.175 --> 00:32:20.835\nthis episode.\n\n698\n00:32:20.835 --> 00:32:23.475\nSo, it looks like we will have\nto come back for a part two.\n\n699\n00:32:23.475 --> 00:32:24.955\nHopefully we'll see you guys there,\nbut for\n\n700\n00:32:24.955 --> 00:32:28.900\nas for now, signing off for\nITProTV I've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n701\n00:32:28.900 -->

00:00:17.012\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.012 --> 00:00:19.039\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n8\n00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.479\nin today's episode we are back with\nmore of course on our ECIH series.\n\n9\n00:00:23.479 --> 00:00:27.187\nAnd joining us back in Thunderdome,\nour good friend Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:27.187 --> 00:00:27.947\nAdam, welcome back man.\n\n11\n00:00:27.947 --> 00:00:28.509\nHow's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:30.240\n&gt;&gt; Thunderdome, I like that.\n\n13\n00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.926\nThat is good.\n\n14\n00:00:30.926 --> 00:00:31.646\n&gt;&gt; Cuz we need a theme.\n\n15\n00:00:31.646 --> 00:00:32.950\n&gt;&gt; Right, but we don't-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n16\n00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.009\n&gt;&gt; Have the elastic bands and\n\n17\n00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:34.942\nthe poles-\n&gt;&gt; And the chain saws.\n\n18\n00:00:34.942 --> 00:00:35.598\n&gt;&gt; And the yeah.\n\n19\n00:00:35.598 --> 00:00:36.813\n&gt;&gt; Don't forget that.\n\n20\n00:00:36.813 --> 00:00:37.334\n&gt;&gt; Cuz that's Thunderdome.\n\n21\n00:00:37.334 --> 00:00:38.438\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Boys and girls.\n\n22\n00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:39.719\n&gt;&gt; Two men enter, one man leave.\n\n23\n00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.966\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, it's like Legoland, only with-\n\n24\n00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:42.879\n&gt;&gt; Blood.\n\n25\n00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:44.454\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; With good blood and guts.\n\n26\n00:00:44.454 --> 00:00:45.566\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n27\n00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.070\n&gt;&gt; So I am doing well, I am doing well.\n\n28\n00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.643\nHopefully everybody out there is also.\n\n29\n00:00:48.643 --> 00:00:53.679\nWe are gonna continue, we are going to\npush through and persevere, as they say.\n\n30\n00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:56.274\nOur conversations are on network\nsecurity incidence management.\n\n31\n00:00:56.274 --> 00:00:58.854\nWhen what we are talking about and\nthinking about,\n\n32\n00:00:58.854 --> 00:01:00.296\nas I step on my power supply.\n\n33\n00:01:00.296 --> 00:01:02.048\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What we're talking about,\n\n34\n00:01:02.048 --> 00:01:04.923\nthinking about, the ideas behind\nnetwork security instances.\n\n35\n00:01:04.923 --> 00:01:06.492\nSo we talked in our last episode,\n\n36\n00:01:06.492 --> 00:01:10.089\nabout the fact that there are a variety\nof incidents that we have to address.\n\n37\n00:01:10.089 --> 00:01:13.366\nBut really focused in on DOS,\ndenial service, DDOS,\n\n38\n00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:15.798\ndistributing denial service attacks.\n\n39\n00:01:15.798 --> 00:01:19.212\nDid a little show and tell,\ntalked about the value of a file wall,\n\n40\n00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:22.620\ntalked about the value of built\nin tools like task manager.\n\n41\n00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.051\nTalk about the command line,\nusing something like netstat.\n\n42\n00:01:26.051 --> 00:01:30.272\nWe didn't really get into nbtstat or arp,\nbut we coulda looked at those as well,\n\n43\n00:01:30.272 --> 00:01:32.519\nin theory to understand what's going on.\n\n44\n00:01:32.519 --> 00:01:37.370\nAnd how we could see information\nabout potentially an inbound\n\n45\n00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.709\nattack against an endpoint.\n\n46\n00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:43.350\nAnd we also talk about\nthe importance of defence in depth.\n\n47\n00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.707\nThis idea of building concentric\nrings of countermeasures and\n\n48\n00:01:46.707 --> 00:01:50.199\ncontrols outbound from where we\nwanna ultimately be protected.\n\n49\n00:01:50.199 --> 00:01:52.315\nAnd laying enough of those systems and\n\n50\n00:01:52.315 --> 00:01:57.081\nthose architecture thought processes in\nplace that we're gonna push the protection\n\n51\n00:01:57.081 --> 00:02:00.870\nboundary out far enough that we're\ngonna absorb inbound attacks.\n\n52\n00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.990\nThey may even be successful and\nget all the way in.\n\n53\n00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.080\nBut we're gonna delay hopefully\nlong enough that we can find\n\n54\n00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.438\nevidence of these attacks or\nstop them before they reach us.\n\n55\n00:02:09.438 --> 00:02:12.703\nAnd we wanna think about the fact\nthat as an incident responder,\n\n56\n00:02:12.703 --> 00:02:15.376\nwe may actually be able to manage and\ninteract with.\n\n57\n00:02:15.376 --> 00:02:17.527\nAnd monitor at different choke points,\nright?\n\n58\n00:02:17.527 --> 00:02:19.910\nOn the inbound and\noutbound traffic streams.\n\n59\n00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.330\nWe focused on the idea of the endpoint and\nsaying okay, let's look at the firewall,\n\n60\n00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.100\nlet's look at this, let's look at that.\n\n61\n00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.486\nLet's see evidence of that, but we could\npush that out easily as I suggested to\n\n62\n00:02:30.486 --> 00:02:33.287\nthe firewall, to the IDS,\nthe IPS, the router.\n\n63\n00:02:33.287 --> 00:02:36.760\nAnd at different levels to proxy,\nin theory, right?\n\n64\n00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.250\nOr whatever the gateway may be and\nwe could be looking at that.\n\n65\n00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.910\nWe could push it upstream as I suggested,\nall the way up to the ISP and\n\n66\n00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.740\nhave them help us and\nlook at that traffic.\n\n67\n00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.720\nSo there's lots of different\nplaces that as incident managers,\n\n68\n00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.370\nincident handlers, incident responders,\n\n69\n00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.690\nthat we could be there's valuable\nintelligence that we can indeed extract.\n\n70\n00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.820\nAnd extrapolate that intelligence to\nbetter understand what's happening.\n\n71\n00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.440\nSo just wanna make that point, reinforce\nthat, have you be thinking along those\n\n72\n00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.320\nlines as we move from that conversation\ninto some additional areas that\n\n73\n00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.400\nare gonna be valuable for us with\nregards to network security incidents.\n\n74\n00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.860\nWhat about unauthorized access?\n\n75\n00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.774\nI know we talked about this before, and\nwhen we talk about the idea of access\n\n76\n00:03:15.774 --> 00:03:20.688\ncontrol, how we validate, verify,\nand authorize user identity in order\n\n77\n00:03:20.688 --> 00:03:24.605\nto ensure that we're granting\naccess to the appropriate.\n\n78\n00:03:24.605 --> 00:03:28.449\nWe authorize the correct users\nunder the proper conditions for\n\n79\n00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:31.280\nthe right reasons to the right resources.\n\n80\n00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.280\nWe have to think about access control, and\nthis sounds sometimes like, it's so easy,\n\n81\n00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.490\nand I have this conversation\na lot with people.\n\n82\n00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.570\nWell how hard can access control be,\nright?\n\n83\n00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.925\nJust put a lock on the door and only give\nkeys to people that belong there, right?\n\n84\n00:03:43.925 --> 00:03:45.960\nI mean how challenging would that be?\n\n85\n00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.480\nBut the reality is,\n\n86\n00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.840\nit's very challenging because clearly\nwe know people lose their keys.\n\n87\n00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.100\nWe know people lose their\ncredit cards too, as you and\n\n88\n00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.945\nI were just talking about, right?\n\n89\n00:03:52.945 --> 00:03:53.842\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n90\n00:03:53.842 --> 00:03:55.096\n&gt;&gt; But they lose their keys at\n\n91\n00:03:55.096 --> 00:03:56.100\ndrive thru's.\n\n92\n00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.233\nAt all sorts of places,\nthey leave them behind.\n\n93\n00:03:58.233 --> 00:04:01.480\nI've left keys and or\nother things around before.\n\n94\n00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.210\nMost of us probably have, although not\na lot of us will admit that in public.\n\n95\n00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:06.866\nBut that's the reality, right?\n\n96\n00:04:06.866 --> 00:04:10.813\nBut people do, and when people lose\nkeys in key management, by the way,\n\n97\n00:04:10.813 --> 00:04:14.954\none of the most important aspects of\naccess control that we need to focus on as\n\n98\n00:04:14.954 --> 00:04:18.539\nan incident responder,\nincident handler, incident manager.\n\n99\n00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:23.255\nHow well are we documenting, controlling,\nand managing thee key life cycle.\n\n100\n00:04:23.255 --> 00:04:26.353\nSo we better understand where those\nkeys are and what they're doing.\n\n101\n00:04:26.353 --> 00:04:29.948\nAnd if we don't have knowledge of them,\nhow do we then understand how to cancel\n\n102\n00:04:29.948 --> 00:04:32.520\nthem and\nverify that they're out of the system?\n\n103\n00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.570\nThese are the subtle but important areas\nof key management of access control,\n\n104\n00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.495\nof the kind of conversations we have\nthat sometimes go overlooked and or\n\n105\n00:04:40.495 --> 00:04:41.920\nunderrepresented.\n\n106\n00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.420\nWhen we talk about the importance of and\nthe value of these kinds of controls and\n\n107\n00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.360\ncounter measures.\n\n108\n00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.270\nIt's easy in other words, to say that we\nshould just simply lock down resources,\n\n109\n00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.200\nput some security in front of them and\n\n110\n00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.770\ncall that done with\nregards to access control.\n\n111\n00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.587\nBut that's not the hard part,\nthat is the easy part.\n\n112\n00:04:59.587 --> 00:05:03.937\nThe hard part is implementing that\nin a coherent, concise, controlled,\n\n113\n00:05:03.937 --> 00:05:08.010\naudible and verifiable way that can\nbe managed to the betterment of and\n\n114\n00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.856\nultimately the advantage\nof the organization.\n\n115\n00:05:10.856 --> 00:05:16.110\nAnd to deny access to those unauthorized\nusers that don't belong in the system.\n\n116\n00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.953\nBut in addition to verify that if they\ndo manage to get past those gateways,\n\n117\n00:05:19.953 --> 00:05:21.977\nthose sentries, those trump points.\n\n118\n00:05:21.977 --> 00:05:26.052\nThat we have a record of that and we can\nthen go back and verify what happened,\n\n119\n00:05:26.052 --> 00:05:29.640\nand forensically as we'll talk\nabout in upcoming episodes.\n\n120\n00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.210\nUnderstand how to unwind that\ninformation and examine it, so\n\n121\n00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.790\nwe can authoratatively say we did or\ndid not have it.\n\n122\n00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.767\nThis is the soft underbelly, right?\n\n123\n00:05:37.767 --> 00:05:41.428\nOf access control that we need to\nfocus on, and the soft underbelly and\n\n124\n00:05:41.428 --> 00:05:45.150\nthe dark side of the story for any and\nall of these control mechanisms and\n\n125\n00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.906\ncountermeasures we talk about.\n\n126\n00:05:46.906 --> 00:05:52.760\nIt's not in other words, just about\nhow good we are at implementing.\n\n127\n00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.570\nIt's about how we react when things\ngo wrong despite our best efforts to\n\n128\n00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.710\nimplement that we're really here to talk\nabout with regards to insert handling.\n\n129\n00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.370\nBecause we have to, as I keep saying\nto you, admit to ourselves and\n\n130\n00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.350\nbe honest with ourselves, our customers,\n\n131\n00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.370\nour clients, others that we're not\nalways gonna have all the answers.\n\n132\n00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.063\nAnd we're not always gonna be successful\nat stopping all of those attacks.\n\n133\n00:06:12.063 --> 00:06:16.410\nWoe, to the security professional,\nI often tell my students and my customers.\n\n134\n00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.670\nWoe to the security professional that\ntells you that they know everything and\n\n135\n00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.610\nthat everything is fine.\n\n136\n00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.670\nBecause everything is not fine and\nthey don't know everything.\n\n137\n00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:28.990\nBecause if they did, they'd be out\nfighting fires right now instead of\n\n138\n00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.570\ntelling you that things are fine.\n\n139\n00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.850\nBecause we know that\nthings are going wrong,\n\n140\n00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.510\nwe just don't necessarily see\nevidence of it all the time.\n\n141\n00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:38.500\nAnd so when I tell customers I believe,\n\n142\n00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.880\nI think I am somewhat confident\nthat at the moment we're okay,\n\n143\n00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.750\nthat's different than definitively\neverything is good go home, no problem.\n\n144\n00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.580\nThere's always that nagging voice\nin the back of my head that says,\n\n145\n00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.460\nthere's something going on I just\nhave not seen evidence of it,\n\n146\n00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.780\nI don't know what it is right?\n\n147\n00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.640\nI don't know where it is, I don't know\nwhat it will be, but I can tell you\n\n148\n00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.510\nthat there's something that we're gonna\nhave to pay attention to at some point.\n\n149\n00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:04.478\nIt's one of the few things we can\nguarantee, we can rely on, that death and\n\n150\n00:07:04.478 --> 00:07:05.151\ntaxes, right?\n\n151\n00:07:05.151 --> 00:07:07.234\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The three,\n\n152\n00:07:07.234 --> 00:07:10.246\nthe trifecta if you will of the knowns.\n\n153\n00:07:10.246 --> 00:07:12.617\nSo unauthorized access,\nvery important for us to consider.\n\n154\n00:07:12.617 --> 00:07:16.760\nWhat about unauthorized access, how do we\ngain unauthorized access for any means?\n\n155\n00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.442\nSocial engineering, for instance,\n\n156\n00:07:18.442 --> 00:07:22.289\nsomebody tricks somebody into giving us a\ncredential, trick them into letting us in.\n\n157\n00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:25.590\nWe may be able to brute force our way in.\n\n158\n00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:29.010\nJust hack away at it, guess it,\nwhatever you may wanna call that.\n\n159\n00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.550\nWe may exploit vulnerabilities\nin the operating system.\n\n160\n00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.660\nMay exploit vulnerabilities\nin the network architecture.\n\n161\n00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:38.980\nMay exploit misconfigurations and\nor weaknesses in software.\n\n162\n00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.580\nThere's all these different\nattack vectors, locations, right?\n\n163\n00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:48.030\nThat we can essentially, potentially, come\nat you from to gain unauthorized access.\n\n164\n00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:52.679\nRemember, the idea behind this is that\nbecause we're not aware of every weakness,\n\n165\n00:07:52.679 --> 00:07:55.768\nbecause we can't possibly\nknow every vulnerability.\n\n166\n00:07:55.768 --> 00:08:00.322\nThere may be things that we think and\nwe take for granted are okay that today,\n\n167\n00:08:00.322 --> 00:08:01.116\nindeed are.\n\n168\n00:08:01.116 --> 00:08:03.544\nBut tomorrow may become a vulnerability,\nmay become a weakness.\n\n169\n00:08:03.544 --> 00:08:07.269\nWe have not accounted for them, cuz we\nhad no reason to think they would be,\n\n170\n00:08:07.269 --> 00:08:09.130\nnow all of a sudden they are.\n\n171\n00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.620\nAnd so there's always this unknown\nthat is behind the scenes,\n\n172\n00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.000\nthat we have to be aware of.\n\n173\n00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.460\nInsider threats, another huge one.\n\n174\n00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:20.320\nWe're gonna do a whole episode\ncoming up on insider threats.\n\n175\n00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.980\nJust the importance of that alone,\n\n176\n00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:26.060\nbecause people that are on the inside\nthat are authorized at a certain level.\n\n177\n00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:29.870\nBut perhaps, not authorized at the level\nthat they want to gain access at\n\n178\n00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:33.740\nto take on some sort of, system,\nand gain access, gain advantage.\n\n179\n00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:37.730\nYou carry out some sort of,\nnegative deed inside the organization, and\n\n180\n00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:40.250\ncreate a negative consequence,\nnegative outcome.\n\n181\n00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:44.760\nThose people, those opportunists,\nwe have to watch them even more carefully.\n\n182\n00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.050\nBecause they're already on the inside.\n\n183\n00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:47.920\nThey're already trusted\nat a certain level.\n\n184\n00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.380\nThey already have access\nat a certain level.\n\n185\n00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:54.320\nWe take for granted, unfortunately, a lot\nof the times that the people we work with,\n\n186\n00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.600\nwork for, and work around\nare not gonna get up to no good.\n\n187\n00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:04.020\nAnd studies show, right, that most of the\nattacks we deal with that are successful,\n\n188\n00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.050\nunfortunately, come from\nthe inside in some way.\n\n189\n00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:09.500\nAnd this is an issue,\nthis is a concern for us.\n\n190\n00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.680\nI'm not suggesting that you\nlook around the room and\n\n191\n00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:15.030\nsay that five out of the ten\npeople that you just sat down and\n\n192\n00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.760\nbroke bread with over lunch\nare bad actors, but guess what?\n\n193\n00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.360\nFive out of ten people\nyou just sat down and\n\n194\n00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.130\nbroke bread with over lunch probably are.\n\n195\n00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:24.120\nQuestion is which five?\n\n196\n00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:24.630\n&gt;&gt; Which five.\n\n197\n00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:27.190\n&gt;&gt; It's always the people that want\nmore than they bring to the table and\n\n198\n00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:28.250\nare not willing to share.\n\n199\n00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:30.830\nI find those are the people\nthat are the bad actors.\n\n200\n00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:32.780\n&gt;&gt; Person that's always like,\nyou gonna eat that?\n\n201\n00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You're not gonna have that, right?\n\n202\n00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:34.990\nI'm gonna have that.\n\n203\n00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:37.350\n&gt;&gt; That's the one right there,\nthe overly needy one.\n\n204\n00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:40.210\nThat's the one that usually\nwinds up being the bad actor.\n\n205\n00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:41.090\nI'm kidding, of course.\n\n206\n00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:42.750\nI have no way of knowing\nwho the bad actor is.\n\n207\n00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.917\n&gt;&gt; So horrible gambling debts and.\n\n208\n00:09:44.917 --> 00:09:45.448\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n209\n00:09:45.448 --> 00:09:45.951\n&gt;&gt; Might be him.\n\n210\n00:09:45.951 --> 00:09:48.281\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; I have a need for\nfour bottles of soda but\n\n211\n00:09:48.281 --> 00:09:51.430\nI could only afford three.\nWhat will you pay me if I can provide you\n\n212\n00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:52.340\nwith information?\n\n213\n00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:52.984\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n214\n00:09:52.984 --> 00:09:57.943\n&gt;&gt; So the reality is that we have to think\nabout the fact that sometimes it's easy\n\n215\n00:09:57.943 --> 00:09:58.564\nto spot.\n\n216\n00:09:58.564 --> 00:10:01.140\nIt's, hey, it's the person with\nthe chip on their shoulder.\n\n217\n00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:02.440\nIt's the person that's never happy.\n\n218\n00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:06.590\nIt's the person that's always working late\nand doing strange things at strange hours.\n\n219\n00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:09.135\nThey may or may not be the bad actors,\nby the way, but\n\n220\n00:10:09.135 --> 00:10:12.085\nthe point is they're acting in a way that\nat least gives us an idea that we should\n\n221\n00:10:12.085 --> 00:10:13.995\npay more attention to them and find out.\n\n222\n00:10:13.995 --> 00:10:16.095\nBut it could be the quiet\nperson who's just head's down,\n\n223\n00:10:16.095 --> 00:10:20.305\ndoing everything normal,\nthat doesn't look suspicious at all.\n\n224\n00:10:20.305 --> 00:10:21.925\nHide in plain sight.\n\n225\n00:10:21.925 --> 00:10:22.925\n&gt;&gt; Best place.\n&gt;&gt; Could be me.\n\n226\n00:10:22.925 --> 00:10:25.705\nMaybe that signal's streaming into\nyour machine right now encoded\n\n227\n00:10:25.705 --> 00:10:30.615\nwith malware that's taking over your\nmachines as we are talking to you.\n\n228\n00:10:30.615 --> 00:10:32.630\nRemember Halloween?\n\n229\n00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:36.974\nWhere they send the signal, it was one of\nthe original Halloween I forget which one.\n\n230\n00:10:36.974 --> 00:10:41.460\nBut they send the signal to control the\nkids when they put on the pumpkin masks?\n\n231\n00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.320\nThere's the audio signal in the TV?\n\n232\n00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.460\n&gt;&gt; I don't recall that.\n\n233\n00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah there was the audio\nsignal in the TV and\n\n234\n00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:50.410\nthen it turns them into these raving\n&gt;&gt; Like monster lunatics over Halloween.\n\n235\n00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:50.940\n&gt;&gt; That sounds fun.\n\n236\n00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it could be that.\n\n237\n00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:53.190\nSo more on this story.\n\n238\n00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:55.446\nDon't put on the Halloween mask for\nyour Halloween [CROSSTALK].\n\n239\n00:10:55.446 --> 00:10:58.769\n&gt;&gt; That makes me think of the X-Files\nepisode where they had special black boxes\n\n240\n00:10:58.769 --> 00:11:00.720\ninstalled in people's cable televisions.\n\n241\n00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.460\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, there was that one.\n\n242\n00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:02.330\n&gt;&gt; They're doing the same thing, yeah.\n\n243\n00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.475\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that was essentially\nthe same thing, absolutely correct.\n\n244\n00:11:04.475 --> 00:11:06.815\n&gt;&gt; We are not responsible For\nany mayhem you may incur.\n\n245\n00:11:06.815 --> 00:11:07.340\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes so\n\n246\n00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.990\nif there actually is\na secret carrier signal.\n\n247\n00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:11.050\n&gt;&gt; It's not us.\n\n248\n00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:12.820\n&gt;&gt; In this has nothing to do with us.\n\n249\n00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.100\nThere's a disclaimer on the bottom\nof the screen that will come up-\n\n250\n00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.750\n&gt;&gt; Flashing, flashing.\n\n251\n00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:17.300\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n252\n00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:18.540\nBut you never know.\n\n253\n00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.330\nMy point is you don't know.\n\n254\n00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:21.670\nWe'll talk more about this.\n\n255\n00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:23.310\n&gt;&gt; Particular concept\nfrom another episode.\n\n256\n00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:27.580\nBut you just generically, there's so\nmany different places and ways, and\n\n257\n00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:31.130\nopportunities, and\nthread vectors, that bad actors,\n\n258\n00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:33.130\nthat threat sources can take advantage of.\n\n259\n00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:35.540\nAnd unauthorized access can\ncome from most anywhere.\n\n260\n00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:36.360\nWhat about vendors?\n\n261\n00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.190\nWhat about partners?\n\n262\n00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:41.490\nWhat about federation\nrelationships that in theory,\n\n263\n00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.600\nimply that we're transiting trust.\n\n264\n00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.510\nBut we don't for\n\n265\n00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:48.660\nsure how those people they were\nentrusting, we gonna respond in as we\n\n266\n00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:53.790\nare when this concerns with issues that we\nhave to be aware of and we think about.\n\n267\n00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:58.330\nWhat about something for unauthorized\naccess what are gonna do when prepare for\n\n268\n00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.760\nthat well adding in logging.\n\n269\n00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.720\nCreating what others can do?\n\n270\n00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.390\nKeep auditable, traceable,\n\n271\n00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:07.190\nverifiable, factual records of\neverything that's going on.\n\n272\n00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.880\nRandomly sample and\ncross check our assumptions with reality.\n\n273\n00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.360\nHey, we're supposed to be\nworking only from nine to five,\n\n274\n00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.610\nsomebody's here after seven o'clock.\n\n275\n00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:16.120\nWhy are they here?\n\n276\n00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.340\nDo they have an exception?\n\n277\n00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:18.990\nHave they been granted permission?\n\n278\n00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:22.110\nAre they authorized and if so,\nunder what conditions and by who?\n\n279\n00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:23.720\nAnd if not, why are they here?\n\n280\n00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.540\nThese are the kind of things\nwe want to think about, so\n\n281\n00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.030\nmaking sure we understand that.\n\n282\n00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:31.550\nNetwork and host based intrusion\ndetection and intrusion prevention.\n\n283\n00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:33.880\nWireless, throw that on top, as well.\n\n284\n00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:39.310\nWether we do a NID, a network based IDS,\na NIP, a network based IPS, a HID,\n\n285\n00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:43.690\na host based IDS A HIP, a host-based IPS.\n\n286\n00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:45.830\nA WIP, a wireless-based IPS.\n\n287\n00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:50.017\nOr WID, wireless-based,\nor host-based, a HID.\n\n288\n00:12:50.017 --> 00:12:53.680\nWireless, a host-based wireless IDS.\n\n289\n00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.520\nWhatever we do, right,\nI've got acronyms on the brain.\n\n290\n00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:57.044\n&gt;&gt; You do.\nThey're all [CROSSTALK].\n\n291\n00:12:57.044 --> 00:12:59.440\n&gt;&gt; I'm actually surprised I got through\nfive or six without screwing that up.\n\n292\n00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.050\n&gt;&gt; That's not too bad.\n\n293\n00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:04.200\n&gt;&gt; That's actually pretty good, cuz\nnormally I'm like done on the third one.\n\n294\n00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.100\nScrambling my alphabets and\nI'm talking in Greek.\n\n295\n00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.950\nRight, so whatever it might be,\nit doesn't really matter.\n\n296\n00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:13.040\nThe point is that these are the kinds\nof things we want to think about,\n\n297\n00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:18.590\nbecause if we can monitor at the third,\nfourth, fifth layer out from\n\n298\n00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:23.080\nthe machine as well as monitor several\nlayers closer in on the machine itself\n\n299\n00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:28.040\nwe're gonna have multiple chances to catch\nthat activity and potentially record it.\n\n300\n00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.380\nSo wanna think about.\n\n301\n00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:30.460\nUsing a SIEM system,\n\n302\n00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:33.500\nI mentioned this before,\nsecurity information event management.\n\n303\n00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.600\nCentralized logging those of you\nthat have been doing this a while,\n\n304\n00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.590\nyou probably would think of that\nmore as a syslog solution which\n\n305\n00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:41.680\nmost of you would probably know it as.\n\n306\n00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.000\nA more modern version,\n\n307\n00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.940\nmore modern interpretation of\nthat is the sims system, right.\n\n308\n00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:46.950\nThe idea is the same.\n\n309\n00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:51.090\nWhether it's Splunk or whatever you\nmay use, doesn't really matter.\n\n310\n00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:54.370\nBut the point is if you're centrally\naggregating and pulling logs in from\n\n311\n00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:59.490\nmultiple systems, you're running deep\npacket analysis, business intelligence,\n\n312\n00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:03.490\nrealtime data visualization and\nanalytic stacks against this data.\n\n313\n00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:08.790\nAnd you're then presenting that data in\ndashboard form, through widgets, whatever.\n\n314\n00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:14.830\nYou're doing but looking for through\ndeep analysis Information and patterns\n\n315\n00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:18.880\nthat may not emerge to the naked eye or\nmay not be obvious to people because it's\n\n316\n00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:23.520\nsuch different in disparate points of data\nthat are coming in from different places.\n\n317\n00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.620\nThis is the strength of tools like this.\n\n318\n00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:29.030\nThe ability to aggregate\ncollateral data points and\n\n319\n00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:32.320\nbring together a much broader picture\nis what we're looking at here, and\n\n320\n00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.160\nso this kind of stuff\nBecomes important as well.\n\n321\n00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:40.810\nHaving detailed response procedures for\na variety of possible outcomes.\n\n322\n00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:45.020\nWe see that somebody's attempting to break\nin to the file server, third, fourth,\n\n323\n00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:47.620\nfifth bad login in a row at\n2 o'clock in the morning.\n\n324\n00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:51.195\nWe should have an IPS that automatically\ncuts off that inbound IP address,\n\n325\n00:14:51.195 --> 00:14:56.510\nre-program the fire wall, and blocks\ntraffic from that particular end point.\n\n326\n00:14:56.510 --> 00:15:00.320\nAnd maybe we capture the mac address and\nthat information as well, so\n\n327\n00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:04.570\nwe understand if it comes back in\na different form from a different IP.\n\n328\n00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:06.090\nBut it's still the same endpoint.\n\n329\n00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:08.550\nthat we can still identify\nthat traffic and block it.\n\n330\n00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:11.110\nthere's all these things\nwe'd have to think about.\n\n331\n00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:14.510\nWhenever we see unauthorized access\nhappening, clearly logging, but\n\n332\n00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:16.610\nalso alerting in multiple forms.\n\n333\n00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:20.750\nDon't just create an alert entry in\nthe log and assume somebody will read it.\n\n334\n00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:25.830\nSend an SMS text message, send a console\nmessage, send an email, right?\n\n335\n00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:29.770\nWhatever the case may be, we've got lots\nof options To do these things today.\n\n336\n00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:31.340\nBut somehow, some way,\n\n337\n00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:35.380\nlet multiple people through multiple\nchannels know that this is going on.\n\n338\n00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:38.540\nProtecting and\nsecure remote access inbound and\n\n339\n00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:43.540\nremote access outbound to other\nremote solutions using encryption.\n\n340\n00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.010\nNumber one.\n\n341\n00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:47.970\nNumber one, number one with\na bullet as we used to say.\n\n342\n00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:50.001\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Number one way to prevent\n\n343\n00:15:50.001 --> 00:15:52.306\nconfidentiality breaches and\n\n344\n00:15:52.306 --> 00:15:57.628\nintegrity compromise is to use\nencryption on all remote connections.\n\n345\n00:15:57.628 --> 00:15:58.995\nAnd some people will take that further and\n\n346\n00:15:58.995 --> 00:16:00.924\nsay well let's encrypt all\ntraffic behind the firewall.\n\n347\n00:16:00.924 --> 00:16:04.732\nLet's use IP SAC or whatever the case may\nbe, let's use that to encrypt everything.\n\n348\n00:16:04.732 --> 00:16:06.828\nAnd there's good and bad with that, right?\n\n349\n00:16:06.828 --> 00:16:08.170\nI mean it makes sense in certain levels.\n\n350\n00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:10.952\nYou may have a problem\nwith certain services,\n\n351\n00:16:10.952 --> 00:16:13.430\nusing IPSec to encrypt everything.\n\n352\n00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:16.190\nCould slow down traffic and\nmay get in the way of certain things.\n\n353\n00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:17.770\nSo there may be some problems there.\n\n354\n00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:21.210\nBut in general, the more\nencryption you put in, the better.\n\n355\n00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:24.750\nThere's never a bad time to encrypt\ntraffic the urban myths and\n\n356\n00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:30.340\nlegends around encryption that imply that\ntraffic will slow down if we encrypt.\n\n357\n00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:34.180\nYeah, traffic definitely slows down\nif we encrypt, no doubt about it.\n\n358\n00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:38.130\nBut can we offset that traffic impact,\nthat negative impact,\n\n359\n00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:40.290\nthat slowdown through acceleration?\n\n360\n00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:41.910\nThrough hardware based accelerators?\n\n361\n00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:44.470\nCan we do that with other mechanisms?\n\n362\n00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:45.950\nAbsolutely.\n\n363\n00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:47.500\nNo issues, no worries there at all.\n\n364\n00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:51.690\nIt's a question of just making the good\ndecisions, the right decisions,\n\n365\n00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:54.430\nknowledgable decisions within the ESA,\n\n366\n00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:57.890\nwithin the enterprise security\narchitecture, in order to figure that out.\n\n367\n00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:59.850\nBut we need to be thinking\nabout about those things.\n\n368\n00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:02.660\nWhat about making sure that\npublicly available and\n\n369\n00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:07.490\npublicly accessible resources\nare published out into a DMZ of some kind,\n\n370\n00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:10.460\na demilitarized zone,\nmaking them available?\n\n371\n00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:14.900\nBut in a standoff way that doesn't allow\nexternal users all the way in behind both\n\n372\n00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:18.520\nprotection perimeters to\nthe internal core of the network?\n\n373\n00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.500\nAgain, this is kind of network\nsecurity at its most basic,\n\n374\n00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.450\nelementary level that we're talking about.\n\n375\n00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:26.990\nBut it's the basic, elementary stuff\nthat is usually the difference\n\n376\n00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:29.940\nbetween a successful and\na non-successful attack.\n\n377\n00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:33.330\nIt's the forgetting to\ncreate the DMZ standoff.\n\n378\n00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:35.630\nIt's the forgetting to\nprogram the firewall.\n\n379\n00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:36.670\nIt's the basic blocking and\n\n380\n00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:40.760\ntackling that often is at the heart\nof most of the analysis that we do.\n\n381\n00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.940\nWe cause analysis when figure out\nwhat's wrong, and we say, you know,\n\n382\n00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:45.690\nhad we done this, this, and this.\n\n383\n00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:48.980\nChances are good this attack may not\nhave occurred and we tend to find one or\n\n384\n00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:51.380\nmore of these items on that list,\nbelieve it or not.\n\n385\n00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:54.420\nAs crazy as that sounds,\npeople not using DMZs today,\n\n386\n00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:59.050\nthat would be a big red flag but\nthe reality is you tend to find that not\n\n387\n00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:03.700\neverybody understands the value of this as\npotentially problematic as that may be.\n\n388\n00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:08.330\nHardening boxes, disabling all unused\nservices, all unnecessary software.\n\n389\n00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:11.900\nAnother great way for\nus to minimize the attack surface.\n\n390\n00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:16.050\nWe call this thought process overall,\nASR, Attack Surface Reduction, right?\n\n391\n00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:18.130\nWhen we think about\nattack surface reduction,\n\n392\n00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:23.170\nand we think about figuring out\nhow to minimize the available\n\n393\n00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:27.450\nhooks that an attacker can go after and\ntake advantage of on a system.\n\n394\n00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:28.840\nThis is another one of those things.\n\n395\n00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:33.200\nWe have lots of names for this, but for\ninstance one example, for many years,\n\n396\n00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:38.490\nWindows servers, not desktops, not Windows\n7, Windows 10 endpoint but a server.\n\n397\n00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:43.100\nServer 12, Server 2008,\nServer 16, whatever it may be.\n\n398\n00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.310\nWe could be cool and time travel,\nand say Server 2020, and\n\n399\n00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:46.640\nwe'd be relevant for,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n400\n00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.400\n&gt;&gt; Lord knows how many more years, right?\n\n401\n00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.520\nBut whatever server it may be, right?\n\n402\n00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:55.480\nUnlike a Linux Unix box, which\ninstalls with a minimal footprint, and\n\n403\n00:18:55.480 --> 00:19:00.720\na minimal set of exposed services\nthat are available, Windows,\n\n404\n00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:04.530\nas we probably all know,\nhas a little but more involved with it.\n\n405\n00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:07.340\nThere are more services spun\nup traditionally by default.\n\n406\n00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:08.750\nOne of the ones that was\nalways a mystery to me and\n\n407\n00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:11.310\ncontinues to be was the audio service,\nright?\n\n408\n00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:13.120\nFor streaming media, things like that.\n\n409\n00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:16.210\nI understand that you may\nwant to listen to audio and\n\n410\n00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:17.980\nhave sound on certain machines.\n\n411\n00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:22.390\nBut I don't know about you, I'm not in the\nhabit of watching movies on my production\n\n412\n00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:26.070\nservers, I'm not in the habit\nof streaming Pandora or\n\n413\n00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:31.810\ndealing with Netflix or running\niTunes on the desktop on my server.\n\n414\n00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:33.830\nAt least you shouldn't be,\nand I hope you're not.\n\n415\n00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:36.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if that's happening,\nthat's like, danger, Will Robinson,\n\n416\n00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:37.530\nstop doing that now.\n\n417\n00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:38.200\n&gt;&gt; Well yeah, my point is,\n\n418\n00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.920\nso what on earth do we need a Windows\naudio service for on a server?\n\n419\n00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.370\n&gt;&gt; Good point.\n&gt;&gt; Now I understand that there\n\n420\n00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:48.250\nare legitimately reasons why you may, and\nI'm not implying that the Windows audio\n\n421\n00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:52.860\nservice is the gateway to all hacking\nthat takes place on Windows servers.\n\n422\n00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:53.690\nQuite the opposite.\n\n423\n00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:56.760\nIt's really not a point of contention for\nthe most part.\n\n424\n00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.590\nBut the fact that that\nservice installs and\n\n425\n00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:03.830\nis active out of the box on certain builds\nof Windows, depending on what version\n\n426\n00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:07.520\nyou're running, is an issue if you're\nnot building media streaming service.\n\n427\n00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.560\nI get the fact that you need it\nwhen you wanna stream media.\n\n428\n00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.340\nI do understand why it's there.\n\n429\n00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:15.510\nBut my point is if you're not in\nthe streaming media business you have no\n\n430\n00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:18.920\nbusiness running an audio service on\na production server that's a domain\n\n431\n00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:23.230\ncontroller, it's absolutely zero value in\nthat being there, it's actually a negative\n\n432\n00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:26.830\nand a consequential vulnerability\nthat may or may not be exploited.\n\n433\n00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:30.610\nAnd when we do a risk assessment on\nthat box even though its not a high\n\n434\n00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:34.580\nvalue target, its high risk in the sense\nthat the window serves itself,\n\n435\n00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:37.990\nprobably can't be exploited,\nthere is the possibility\n\n436\n00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:40.330\nthat somebody will come up with\na vulnerability that can attach to that.\n\n437\n00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:40.960\nWho knows?\n\n438\n00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.570\nThere may all ready be ones out there.\n\n439\n00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:45.490\nMy point is,\nwhy would you do something like this,\n\n440\n00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:47.730\nwhen we know that there's\nnothing good that comes of it.\n\n441\n00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:53.040\nAnd this is not a, hey let's take apart\nMicrosoft and Microsoft's OS conversation.\n\n442\n00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.850\nBut just using it as one example for you.\n\n443\n00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:59.647\nAs a security professional, as an IT\nadministrator, as an incident responder,\n\n444\n00:20:59.647 --> 00:21:02.290\nincident handler, incident manager.\n\n445\n00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:04.530\nWhatever you consider\nyourself to be today,\n\n446\n00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:07.820\nwhatever you would like to be\nin the future in this field,\n\n447\n00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:11.060\nin this general thought process\nthat we are all operating under.\n\n448\n00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:14.970\nWe have to all take responsibility for\nthe systems we manage.\n\n449\n00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:18.120\nWe have to be aware of them and\nwe have to know how to manage them\n\n450\n00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.130\nto the best of our abilities to\nmake them as secure as possible.\n\n451\n00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:25.290\nAnd leaving services and applications\nrunning that have no business being there\n\n452\n00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:28.010\nis just one of the things you\ngotta learn how not to do.\n\n453\n00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:30.220\nI don't know how else to put it,\nI'm just gonna be blunt.\n\n454\n00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:31.340\nYou just can't do it.\n\n455\n00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:32.943\nJust don't do it.-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n456\n00:21:32.943 --> 00:21:34.729\n&gt;&gt; You do it better than I do, right?\n\n457\n00:21:34.729 --> 00:21:37.657\nI can't do the-\n&gt;&gt; Not gonna do it, not at this juncture.\n\n458\n00:21:37.657 --> 00:21:39.390\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n459\n00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:41.340\nYou just shouldn't be doing it, right?\n\n460\n00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:42.880\nAnd so, wanna think about that.\n\n461\n00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.720\nWe know about the value of firewalls,\nI mean years ago,\n\n462\n00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:49.210\nit was unlikely that you'd have a host\nbased firewall that you would be using.\n\n463\n00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:53.050\nYou had to download a third party one,\ninstall it on something like Windows 95,\n\n464\n00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:56.530\nor Windows 98, or\nheaven help us, Millenium.\n\n465\n00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:59.600\nRemember that gloriously fine\nMicrosoft operating system?\n\n466\n00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.240\n&gt;&gt; Ran it for years.\n\n467\n00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.695\nWindows Millenium, the mistake edition.\n\n468\n00:22:01.695 --> 00:22:03.850\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's what happens when you need to\n\n469\n00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:06.560\nput something out, but have not\ndone the homework to get it right.\n\n470\n00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:10.070\nAnd so you rush to market just because,\nboys and girls, and\n\n471\n00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:11.700\nthat's not a good thing.\n\n472\n00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:15.600\nBut most, most Microsoft operating\nsystems very good overall.\n\n473\n00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.155\nMillenium, not so much, right?\n\n474\n00:22:17.155 --> 00:22:18.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But the one thing I miss\n\n475\n00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:20.040\nmore than anything on, not Millenium.\n\n476\n00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:20.900\nI don't miss that.\n\n477\n00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:23.500\nBut probably the best game of all times?\n\n478\n00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.460\nMicrosoft operating systems.\n\n479\n00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:26.430\nPinball.\n\n480\n00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:28.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's right,\nI used to have Pinball.\n\n481\n00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:29.510\nI forgot about that.\n\n482\n00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:30.430\nThey took that away?\n\n483\n00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:33.660\n&gt;&gt; Well it hasn't been in me\nin the core for a long time.\n\n484\n00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:36.215\nSo like Mt windows 74 workstation,\n\n485\n00:22:36.215 --> 00:22:38.235\nyou have pinball, Windows 95,\n98, you had pinball.\n\n486\n00:22:38.235 --> 00:22:42.845\n&gt;&gt; You know there's a hack for, I say\na hack, it's basically a cheat code for\n\n487\n00:22:42.845 --> 00:22:45.385\nMinesweeper where you\ncan find all the mines.\n\n488\n00:22:45.385 --> 00:22:46.563\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you can find all those.\n\n489\n00:22:46.563 --> 00:22:48.915\n[LAUGH] When I get bored and\nI got nothing to do on a plane, and\n\n490\n00:22:48.915 --> 00:22:50.985\nI'm tired of talking to people\nthen I'll actually go into,\n\n491\n00:22:50.985 --> 00:22:54.575\nlet me pretend to be working mode and\neither solitaire or minesweeper.\n\n492\n00:22:54.575 --> 00:22:56.415\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Pinball depending on what I'm running.\n\n493\n00:22:56.415 --> 00:23:00.430\nIf I happen to have a machine I can\nrun Amazon I'll usually spin up an NT4\n\n494\n00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:02.710\nworkstation just to play\npinball cuz I love that game.\n\n495\n00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:03.950\n&gt;&gt; It's amazing, it was good.\n\n496\n00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:05.370\n&gt;&gt; It was a really cool game.\n\n497\n00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:08.450\nAnd recently last few weeks\nI actually believe it or\n\n498\n00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:09.810\nnight the guy who invented Pac-Man died.\n\n499\n00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:10.540\n&gt;&gt; Did he really?\n\n500\n00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, 92 years old.\n\n501\n00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:13.420\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's a shame.\n\n502\n00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.530\nBig Pac-Man players\naround here at ITProTV.\n\n503\n00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:18.290\n&gt;&gt; Gentleman who invented,\nJapanese gentleman.\n\n504\n00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:19.510\nI think he was 92 years old.\n\n505\n00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:23.390\nPassed away earlier at the very,\nvery beginning of the year, actually.\n\n506\n00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:24.440\nSo yeah, unfortunately.\n\n507\n00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.800\nBut yeah, these things happen.\n\n508\n00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:30.130\nSo [LAUGH] that was a random aside,\nby the way, in case you have not.\n\n509\n00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:33.760\nIf you're new to our experience,\nthe Daniel and Adam experience.\n\n510\n00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.710\nThe random aside comes\nwith the experience.\n\n511\n00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:38.370\nIt's a side, when you get the order,\nyou get the side with it.\n\n512\n00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:40.420\nAnd the random aside happens\nduring every episode.\n\n513\n00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.070\nThat was our random aside.\n\n514\n00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:43.250\nSo instance handling, right,\n\n515\n00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:46.520\ndifferent ways that we can be\nthinking about, being proactive.\n\n516\n00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.850\nThese are all important things\nwe should be considering,\n\n517\n00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:49.970\nwe should be thinking about.\n\n518\n00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:53.300\nWhat about inappropriate usage and\ninappropriate usage incidents.\n\n519\n00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:56.635\nPeople taking and\nessentially re-apportioning or\n\n520\n00:23:56.635 --> 00:24:01.490\nredirecting corporate resources and\nnot using them in an appropriate way.\n\n521\n00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:04.799\nSo, we take a computer that\nthe company gives us and we go out and\n\n522\n00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:08.930\nwe surf the web, but we do so here at work\nwhen we're supposed to be doing work.\n\n523\n00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:09.948\nInstead we are streaming.\n\n524\n00:24:09.948 --> 00:24:12.281\nYeah, I don't know,\nwatching Netflix or who knows what.\n\n525\n00:24:12.281 --> 00:24:15.226\nMaybe we're making personal\nphone calls on corporate assets,\n\n526\n00:24:15.226 --> 00:24:18.310\nand they're long distance, and\nwe're charging the company.\n\n527\n00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:20.980\nThere's all these examples of\nwhat inappropriate usage may be.\n\n528\n00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:25.420\nAgain, the idea would be, this is the kind\nof stuff that we may have to respond to\n\n529\n00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:28.280\nas incident managers and\nwe need to think about that.\n\n530\n00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.130\nAre we auditing for this behavior?\n\n531\n00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:31.650\nAre we thinking about those things?\n\n532\n00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:33.690\nDo we have a way of understanding them?\n\n533\n00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:36.910\nWe should have policies that tell\npeople what they can and cannot do.\n\n534\n00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:40.260\nWe should have acceptable use policies.\n\n535\n00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:42.240\nWe should have Internet policies.\n\n536\n00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.110\nWe should have mobile device management\npolicies, all these different policies.\n\n537\n00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:47.960\nSpoke about some of these\nin prior episodes as well,\n\n538\n00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:49.670\nyou're just thinking\nabout that kind of stuff.\n\n539\n00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:52.750\nWhat about multiple\ncomponent system incidents?\n\n540\n00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:56.100\nSystem incidents that involve multiple\nsystems or components of them.\n\n541\n00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:59.980\nSometimes it's a DOS attack, a one-on-one\nattack against a single system.\n\n542\n00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:03.770\nOther times, as we said,\n[COUGH] Pardon me.\n\n543\n00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:06.400\nOther times as we've said, there could be\n\n544\n00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:10.010\na distraction that's been created on\npurpose where we attack a system, and\n\n545\n00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:13.860\nthen the actual goal or target of\nthe real attack is somewhere else, and\n\n546\n00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:16.865\nwe've now have multiple systems\nthat are involved, right?\n\n547\n00:25:16.865 --> 00:25:19.245\nMultiple components in\nour multiple systems.\n\n548\n00:25:19.245 --> 00:25:24.345\nThis is a whole different kind of\nincident than me just sitting here using\n\n549\n00:25:24.345 --> 00:25:28.740\nsome malware and attempting to attack\nDaniel's machine while we're working.\n\n550\n00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:30.300\nInstead, I'll launch three or\n\n551\n00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:33.945\nfour different attacks simultaneously\nagainst different systems to hide\n\n552\n00:25:33.945 --> 00:25:37.201\nin the chaos, right essentially and\nyou'll not be found easily.\n\n553\n00:25:37.201 --> 00:25:38.529\nSo we have to think about this as well.\n\n554\n00:25:38.529 --> 00:25:40.872\nThe combination of two or\nmore attacks in or\n\n555\n00:25:40.872 --> 00:25:45.303\non systems simultaneously are gonna be\nqualified as multiple component error or\n\n556\n00:25:45.303 --> 00:25:50.070\nmultiple system involved incidents, and\nthese are much tougher to figure out.\n\n557\n00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:54.920\nThe responsibility of the incident manager\nincident handler is broader because now,\n\n558\n00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:58.350\nwe have to survey and\naddress multiple systems.\n\n559\n00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:02.130\nWe may or may not understand the\nconnection between them on the surface.\n\n560\n00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:04.550\nIt may be hard to experience,\nand understand, and\n\n561\n00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:07.060\nsee that these are indeed related.\n\n562\n00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:09.930\nThere's lots of different\nthings that may go on.\n\n563\n00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:10.820\nSo, it's very difficult for\n\n564\n00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:13.200\nus to understand sometimes\nwhat may be happening.\n\n565\n00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.180\nAnd we have to understand and\nbe aware of, or\n\n566\n00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:20.642\nat least think about the fact that\nthese attacks may be separate, right?\n\n567\n00:26:20.642 --> 00:26:24.700\nThey maybe isolated, but they may also\nactually be tell tell signs of a broader\n\n568\n00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:29.160\nplan, right, to gain control in\na much broader way of our network or\n\n569\n00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:33.130\nperhaps use our network as a stepping\nstone to get into other systems.\n\n570\n00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:36.800\nRemember, we talked about the idea of\nsupply chain risk up and down, right?\n\n571\n00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:40.460\nThe supply chain before through\nfederation, through partnership,\n\n572\n00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:45.120\nthrough vendor relationships, more and\nmore companies are opening themselves up\n\n573\n00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:49.570\nto allowing outsiders coming in to\nuse a variety of their systems.\n\n574\n00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:53.470\nAnd because of that, we talked about the\npropagation of risk, that's a big issue,\n\n575\n00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:58.660\nbut you have to understand that we\nmay want to attack company A, but\n\n576\n00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:01.800\nI may not be able to go at company\nA directly because company A may be very\n\n577\n00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:06.870\nheavily defended on the front end from\njust an anonymous inbound connection at\n\n578\n00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:08.780\nthe firewall or whatever,\nthat's probably blocked.\n\n579\n00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:13.340\nBut if I can compromise one of the\nsatellite companies that are vendors or\n\n580\n00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:17.470\nfederated partners of company A, and I can\nget into them because maybe they're not as\n\n581\n00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:22.310\nheavily defended, and I can then escalate\nmy way up the chain through back channel\n\n582\n00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:26.820\nconnections that are probably not as\nheavily monitored and as heavily defended.\n\n583\n00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:31.530\nBecause once I get in behind a trusted\npartner's protection parameter.\n\n584\n00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:32.390\n&gt;&gt; There's some trust there.\n\n585\n00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:35.470\n&gt;&gt; I am most likely trusted\nby the primary target.\n\n586\n00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:38.400\nAnd then the burden of proof and\ntherefore the ability\n\n587\n00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:42.200\nto transit that network to get in,\nis probably a lot lower.\n\n588\n00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:45.980\nAnd this is something that, again,\na lot of security professionals and\n\n589\n00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:48.160\na lot of incident handlers miss.\n\n590\n00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:51.880\nWe spend all our time and\nenergy focusing up front\n\n591\n00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:55.670\non let's protect company A cuz that's\nwhere the big rocks are, right?\n\n592\n00:27:55.670 --> 00:28:00.680\nWell, yeah, absolutely, but\nif your back doors are not protected,\n\n593\n00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:04.920\nthen all the good security and\nthe intentions on the front end\n\n594\n00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:08.080\nare worthless as soon as somebody looks\nbehind the curtain and says, what about\n\n595\n00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:11.590\nall those things over there that are wide\nopen that nobody is paying attention to.\n\n596\n00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:13.720\nWhy am I going to kill myself\ntrying to come through here.\n\n597\n00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:16.160\nI'll go sneak around the back\nwhere nobody's looking and\n\n598\n00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.890\nyou keep beating away up here, right?\n\n599\n00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:20.945\nI'll set up a botnet that's\ngonna just slam you with\n\n600\n00:28:20.945 --> 00:28:22.510\nDDoS up here to keep you busy.\n\n601\n00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:25.890\nAnd I'll just go walk around the backend\nand help myself to whatever I want.\n\n602\n00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:27.550\nAnd that's what happens, right?\n\n603\n00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:31.230\nSo we have to think about the fact that,\na lot of times,\n\n604\n00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:34.090\nit's not the direct frontal\nassaults that are successful.\n\n605\n00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:38.710\nThose are the fakes, those are essentially\nthe fake attacks that keep us busy so\n\n606\n00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:40.790\nthat somebody can come\nin from somewhere else,\n\n607\n00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:43.250\nthat we're not normally\npaying attention to.\n\n608\n00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:45.320\nI mean this is essentially\nthe storyline for\n\n609\n00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:48.500\nevery good spy and sci-fi movie out there.\n\n610\n00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.550\nDon't pay attention to\nwhat's going on here,\n\n611\n00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:53.970\nbecause we really have the fake thing\ngoing on, now we're gonna go over here.\n\n612\n00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:56.200\nBut I mean, you've got to figure that out,\nright, that's the important thing.\n\n613\n00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.970\nSo just keep in mind as we wrap\nup this particular conversation,\n\n614\n00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:01.260\nthis episode here.\n\n615\n00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:03.693\nThat this is the stuff\nthat really makes for\n\n616\n00:29:03.693 --> 00:29:07.887\nthe successful incident handling,\nthe successful incident managing,\n\n617\n00:29:07.887 --> 00:29:11.930\nthe successful incident responding\nthat we're talking about.\n\n618\n00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:15.160\nThe ability as we keep talking about\nis to not only be outside the box, but\n\n619\n00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:19.340\nyou have to be able to see the entire\nlandscape, the threat landscape, and\n\n620\n00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:22.210\nreally understand what the battle\nfield looks like, right?\n\n621\n00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:26.330\nThis is situation awareness at\nits most basic elemental level,\n\n622\n00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:30.140\nyou can't just be focused on a tunnel\non one specific point if you're\n\n623\n00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:32.250\ngonna be good at what we\nare talking about doing.\n\n624\n00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:36.050\nYou gotta be able to strategically\nenvision the entire platform.\n\n625\n00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:39.360\nAnd, all of the interconnections\nthat are happening, and\n\n626\n00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.840\nsee where those pieces are, and\n\n627\n00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:44.870\nhow they're moving in order to be able to\nunderstand how to bring resources to bear,\n\n628\n00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:48.820\nand respond in real time in those areas\nwhere you're gonna be most impactful.\n\n629\n00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:52.300\n&gt;&gt; It's definitely easier to get myopic\nwhen it comes to computer security.\n\n630\n00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:53.900\nYou think, I've got servers.\n\n631\n00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:55.630\nI got to protect my servers.\n\n632\n00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:58.824\nAnd yet your hosts are completely\nvulnerable, right?\n\n633\n00:29:58.824 --> 00:30:00.880\nYour desktop hosts, or maybe your printer,\n\n634\n00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:04.110\nsomething else that's connected\nthat you thought was insignificant.\n\n635\n00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:06.850\nLike Adam said, you've got to be able\nto look at the entire landscape,\n\n636\n00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:10.570\nthe entire game board as it were and\nfigure out where our\n\n637\n00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:15.130\nevery possible attack might come from,\nand then plan a contingency for that.\n\n638\n00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:17.950\nSo when it comes down\nto unauthorized access,\n\n639\n00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:22.705\ndon't forget people trying to use access\nthat they have in inappropriate ways,\n\n640\n00:30:22.705 --> 00:30:24.575\nyou have to know how to\nhandle those things.\n\n641\n00:30:24.575 --> 00:30:28.615\nAdam we appreciate you reminding us in\nthe different methods that we might\n\n642\n00:30:28.615 --> 00:30:31.075\nuse to mitigate those types of things.\n\n643\n00:30:31.075 --> 00:30:35.681\nAs well as reminding us that we've gotta\nkeep our eye on the entire game board.\n\n644\n00:30:35.681 --> 00:30:38.706\nThat being said though, it looks like\nwe're out of time for this episode,\n\n645\n00:30:38.706 --> 00:30:41.923\nso we'll have to come back for one more\ncuz Adam's got some really cool tools and\n\n646\n00:30:41.923 --> 00:30:43.243\nthings that he wants to show us.\n\n647\n00:30:43.243 --> 00:30:44.771\nSo we're gonna have to\ntake a look at that.\n\n648\n00:30:44.771 --> 00:30:48.299\nThat being said, it is time for\nus to sign out, we do appreciate for\n\n649\n00:30:48.299 --> 00:30:49.373\njoining us though.\n\n650\n00:30:49.373 --> 00:30:51.490\nFor ITPRO.TV I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowery.\n\n651\n00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:52.112\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n652\n00:30:52.112 --> 00:30:55.275\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n653\n00:30:55.275 --> 00:31:01.235\n[MUSIC]\n\n654\n00:31:01.235 --> 00:31:06.300\nThank you for

00:00:06.668\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.668 --> 00:00:07.812\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:07.812 --> 00:00:12.441\n&gt;&gt; You are watching ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.441 --> 00:00:14.353\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n7\n00:00:14.353 --> 00:00:17.230\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n8\n00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.434\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n9\n00:00:19.434 --> 00:00:23.170\nin todays episode we are back\nwith more on our ECIH series.\n\n10\n00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.050\nAnd of course joining us in our studio,\nThunderdome as we've been so\n\n11\n00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.911\naffectionately referring it to as-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n12\n00:00:28.911 --> 00:00:31.039\n&gt;&gt; Is a good friend, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n13\n00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:32.252\nAdam, welcome back, man.\n\n14\n00:00:32.252 --> 00:00:33.689\nYou do run Bordertown, by the way.\n\n15\n00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:35.214\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But\n\n16\n00:00:35.214 --> 00:00:36.834\nwe don't have any pigs running around.\n\n17\n00:00:36.834 --> 00:00:38.033\nThe power, that's the whole thing.\n\n18\n00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:39.037\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n19\n00:00:39.037 --> 00:00:41.003\n&gt;&gt; You need the whole underground-\n&gt;&gt; Methane.\n\n20\n00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:42.467\n&gt;&gt; Methane system for delivery of power.\n\n21\n00:00:42.467 --> 00:00:46.804\nSo we are gonna continue our\nconversations, I've relocated to\n\n22\n00:00:46.804 --> 00:00:52.521\nthe extreme left hand corner of the podium\nand we’re gonna do a little show and tell.\n\n23\n00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:56.985\nAnd take a look at some of the tools\nthat are involved with network security\n\n24\n00:00:56.985 --> 00:00:58.429\nincident management.\n\n25\n00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:02.656\nWhat are some things you keep hearing me,\ncertainly hearing Daniel on occasion refer\n\n26\n00:01:02.656 --> 00:01:05.253\nto this idea of the toolbox\nthat we want to build out.\n\n27\n00:01:05.253 --> 00:01:09.787\nAs incident managers, as practitioners,\nput things in our toolbox.\n\n28\n00:01:09.787 --> 00:01:12.185\nMake sure we can use\nthem when appropriate.\n\n29\n00:01:12.185 --> 00:01:15.558\nBut we don't often take the time to\nshow you what some of those tools are.\n\n30\n00:01:15.558 --> 00:01:16.410\nWe have and certainly,\n\n31\n00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.570\nin some of our episodes have\ninvolved a little show and tell.\n\n32\n00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.923\nWe do try to weave that in, but I wanna\nspend some time with you in this episode\n\n33\n00:01:23.923 --> 00:01:27.412\npretty much exclusively going\nthrough some tools with you.\n\n34\n00:01:27.412 --> 00:01:31.368\nWe got a nice list of some common tools,\nand some ones that are not so common.\n\n35\n00:01:31.368 --> 00:01:35.411\nLittle old school, remember Ether Aid,\nremember Saint, some old school tools.\n\n36\n00:01:35.411 --> 00:01:35.998\n&gt;&gt; Saint is old.\n\n37\n00:01:35.998 --> 00:01:37.824\n&gt;&gt; Saint's old, right&gt;\n&gt;&gt; That's old.\n\n38\n00:01:37.824 --> 00:01:41.594\n&gt;&gt; You may not know about some of these,\nyou may have heard of things like\n\n39\n00:01:41.594 --> 00:01:45.642\ncertainly Nmap, may have heard of Ngrep,\nmay or may now know about Ntop.\n\n40\n00:01:45.642 --> 00:01:49.813\nMentioned IP tables, IP chains, so I've\ngiven you a little list of about 8, 9,\n\n41\n00:01:49.813 --> 00:01:53.884\n10 of them that are just defined as\nsensor 240, they're in the show notes.\n\n42\n00:01:53.884 --> 00:01:55.756\nDaniel will make sure we have that for\nyou,\n\n43\n00:01:55.756 --> 00:01:58.211\nI encourage you to take a look at those,\ndownload them.\n\n44\n00:01:58.211 --> 00:02:02.292\nMake sure you're familiar with them, and\nhave a little sense of what they are.\n\n45\n00:02:02.292 --> 00:02:04.898\nBut we're gonna demonstrate\nsome of them for you here.\n\n46\n00:02:04.898 --> 00:02:08.065\nSpend a little time with them,\nget to know them if you will.\n\n47\n00:02:08.065 --> 00:02:12.894\nAnd make them our friends, so that when we\ndo need to call on them they will come and\n\n48\n00:02:12.894 --> 00:02:14.263\nthey will help us out.\n\n49\n00:02:14.263 --> 00:02:19.046\nIf we could, take a look at our screen,\nyou'll see upon my machine that\n\n50\n00:02:19.046 --> 00:02:23.454\nthe first that we're gonna take\na look at is an oldie but a goodie.\n\n51\n00:02:23.454 --> 00:02:26.464\nAnd yet\nit is a newie in the sense that Nessus,\n\n52\n00:02:26.464 --> 00:02:30.030\nwhich is a vulnerability\nassessment scanning tool,\n\n53\n00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.359\nused to be a tool that you would download,\nrun as a localized piece of software.\n\n54\n00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:39.203\nFor many, many years, it was at the top\nof just about everybody's list and\n\n55\n00:02:39.203 --> 00:02:40.170\nit still is.\n\n56\n00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.960\nBut it was bought by\na company called Tenable,\n\n57\n00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.930\nas you can see up there on the screen,\nseveral years back.\n\n58\n00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.581\nIt's now a cloud based platform as well\nas a platform that you can download and\n\n59\n00:02:48.581 --> 00:02:50.280\nrun locally if necessary.\n\n60\n00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.586\nThe nice people at Tenable do give\nus the ability to be able to have\n\n61\n00:02:53.586 --> 00:02:54.566\na demonstration,\n\n62\n00:02:54.566 --> 00:02:58.321\nseven day trial license that fully\nallows you to explore their product.\n\n63\n00:02:58.321 --> 00:02:59.579\nWe wanna thank them for that.\n\n64\n00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.579\nIt is good when we can take advantage\nof these kinds of demonstrations.\n\n65\n00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:04.974\nIt's good when practitioners,\n\n66\n00:03:04.974 --> 00:03:08.272\nand people that wanna learn about these\ntools have an option to play with them.\n\n67\n00:03:08.272 --> 00:03:11.590\nAnd get to know them before they make\na commitment to deploy them, and buy them.\n\n68\n00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.517\nSo it's always good when venders\nstep up and do that for us, and\n\n69\n00:03:14.517 --> 00:03:17.074\nwanna recognize that, and\ncall that out when they do.\n\n70\n00:03:17.074 --> 00:03:20.897\nAnd when you take a look at the Nessus\nwebsite, and you could certainly go and\n\n71\n00:03:20.897 --> 00:03:24.441\ndo this on your own if you wann be able\nto install and play with the tool.\n\n72\n00:03:24.441 --> 00:03:28.460\nYou'll find that it's very simple to be\nable to see those different categories,\n\n73\n00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.675\nNessus Manager, Nessus Professional, and\n\n74\n00:03:30.675 --> 00:03:32.967\nyou can learn a little\nbit more about each one.\n\n75\n00:03:32.967 --> 00:03:35.836\nThere's a free trial option there,\nyou click that,\n\n76\n00:03:35.836 --> 00:03:37.503\nyou go to a page where you go in.\n\n77\n00:03:37.503 --> 00:03:40.240\nYou put some information in,\nthey'll email you a license code,\n\n78\n00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.040\ntypically within 24 hours,\npretty quick to get that.\n\n79\n00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.610\nReally very simple to download, the one\nthing I will tell you about Nessus just so\n\n80\n00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.640\nyou know, so you're not caught off guard.\n\n81\n00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.680\nA very thorough tool,\n\n82\n00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.740\nwe're gonna take a look at it and take\na look at how it runs in just a minute.\n\n83\n00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.276\nFirst time install, set it up, you have to\nsync it, and download a bunch of updates,\n\n84\n00:03:57.276 --> 00:03:58.731\nplugins, patches, etc.\n\n85\n00:03:58.731 --> 00:04:02.242\nAnd it's gonna take a while for it to do\nit's thing and actually be ready to go.\n\n86\n00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:06.394\nSo don't do this and come back in five\nminutes and expect to be up and running.\n\n87\n00:04:06.394 --> 00:04:10.330\nIt'll take you a good hour, hour and\na half from the time you install,\n\n88\n00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.282\nput that license in,\nget in there and configure it.\n\n89\n00:04:13.282 --> 00:04:16.170\nAnd then say,\nokay I'd like to actually run a scan.\n\n90\n00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.260\nIt's gonna take a while to sync up and\ndownload for\n\n91\n00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.560\nyou, so just be aware of that.\n\n92\n00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.250\nIt's not a bad thing, it's just the thing\nthat you gotta know about first time\n\n93\n00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.080\nyou're gonna run the tool.\n\n94\n00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.310\nAfter that it doesn't auto update\nmuch like many of these tools do.\n\n95\n00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.468\nYeah, every 24 hours it's looking for\nstuff, that kinda thing, so\n\n96\n00:04:29.468 --> 00:04:30.742\nit'll be quick after that.\n\n97\n00:04:30.742 --> 00:04:34.342\nBut the initial one it takes\na little bit of time to setup.\n\n98\n00:04:34.342 --> 00:04:37.427\nWhen we do install, we do configure.\n\n99\n00:04:37.427 --> 00:04:41.158\nYou will see that you get essentially a\nweb based home page that’s you log into on\n\n100\n00:04:41.158 --> 00:04:41.944\nthe local host.\n\n101\n00:04:41.944 --> 00:04:44.787\nNow another little interesting\nlittle tidbit for you,\n\n102\n00:04:44.787 --> 00:04:48.307\nI am running on this particular\ndemo machine, a Windows 7 machine.\n\n103\n00:04:48.307 --> 00:04:53.470\nInitially, I think IE8 is the default\nin Windows 7 if I remember correctly.\n\n104\n00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.597\nAnd I was having trouble getting in and\ngetting the homepage to launch in IE.\n\n105\n00:04:57.597 --> 00:04:59.861\nBecause you need to connect securely and\n\n106\n00:04:59.861 --> 00:05:04.040\nI could not get an HTTPS connection\nto come up and render the right way.\n\n107\n00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.020\nNot because we don't support that\nin IE8 that's not the reason, but\n\n108\n00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.920\nbecause the code for\nthe web page no longer runs and\n\n109\n00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.430\nthe old browsers not supported anymore.\n\n110\n00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.724\nSo I had to take that URL,\n\n111\n00:05:13.724 --> 00:05:17.855\ngo over to our trusty friend Chrome, load\nthat up, go through the ten minutes of\n\n112\n00:05:17.855 --> 00:05:21.511\nclicking through are you really sure\nyou wanna connect not securely?\n\n113\n00:05:21.511 --> 00:05:24.092\nIt's absolutely impossible to do this,\nit's an advanced feature,\n\n114\n00:05:24.092 --> 00:05:24.889\nare you really sure?\n\n115\n00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:26.821\nIf you're really sure\nwe'll let you connect.\n\n116\n00:05:26.821 --> 00:05:29.578\nAnd I finally was able to get\nChrome to say, okay, bring it up.\n\n117\n00:05:29.578 --> 00:05:34.150\nAnd you could see it does give me the,\nhey, you're not secure connection.\n\n118\n00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.156\nAnd I love the fact they\ncross out HTTPS just\n\n119\n00:05:36.156 --> 00:05:36.690\nto-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n120\n00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.746\n&gt;&gt; Really belabor the point in red\nthat you're not connecting securely.\n\n121\n00:05:39.746 --> 00:05:45.107\nBut you do connect local host and then\nport 8834, and then you have to log in.\n\n122\n00:05:45.107 --> 00:05:47.259\nSo we're gonna do that right now.\n\n123\n00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:54.281\nWe'll go in and type in our\nsuper secret username, ITProTV1.\n\n124\n00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:59.144\nDon't use that boys and girls, cuz that\nwill tell people where you're from and\n\n125\n00:05:59.144 --> 00:06:00.458\nwhat you're doing.\n\n126\n00:06:00.458 --> 00:06:04.047\nWe'll type in our password, the one that\nNate gave me, super secret password.\n\n127\n00:06:04.047 --> 00:06:04.547\nPassword is the-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n128\n00:06:04.547 --> 00:06:06.039\n&gt;&gt; Password we're using, and\n\n129\n00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:10.092\nyou could see that it does tell you you've\ngot some many days left in the demo.\n\n130\n00:06:10.092 --> 00:06:11.942\nSee mine comes up got a few days left.\n\n131\n00:06:11.942 --> 00:06:14.237\nI'm in the middle of running a scan and\n\n132\n00:06:14.237 --> 00:06:19.190\nwe are running kinda a general scan around\nthe network just looking for machines,\n\n133\n00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.789\nhad that running for a while.\nWe're just gonna go and\n\n134\n00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:23.984\ntake a look while it's running take\na look at some of the features.\n\n135\n00:06:23.984 --> 00:06:25.814\nBells and whistles that we have here, but\n\n136\n00:06:25.814 --> 00:06:27.950\nwhen you start out,\nyou log into the webpage.\n\n137\n00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.640\nEssentially looks like this,\nexcept you won't have a scan here,\n\n138\n00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.840\nit'll be empty, right?\n\n139\n00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.760\nAnd you would go and\ngo to New Scan right here,\n\n140\n00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.000\nand I'll show you how to create\na New Scan in just a minute.\n\n141\n00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.762\nBut you would just answer some questions\non the form, either hit Save and\n\n142\n00:06:39.762 --> 00:06:42.609\nthen launch it from the catalogue\nhere under my scans.\n\n143\n00:06:42.609 --> 00:06:46.434\nAnd or you will go in, and\nyou will simply launch it right from\n\n144\n00:06:46.434 --> 00:06:50.043\nthe configuration page and\nit goes off, does its stuff.\n\n145\n00:06:50.043 --> 00:06:50.820\nIt's pretty straight forward.\n\n146\n00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.786\nYou walk away, you come back at some\npoint and you'll be able to do that.\n\n147\n00:06:53.786 --> 00:06:56.914\nNow the nice thing about New Scan,\nlet's go in and take a look.\n\n148\n00:06:56.914 --> 00:07:01.534\nIn the demo, see that there is\nthe upgrade bar across many of the scans\n\n149\n00:07:01.534 --> 00:07:06.406\nthat will require you to have a full\nlicense and to be able to pay to use it.\n\n150\n00:07:06.406 --> 00:07:07.972\nBut you could see the basic scans,\n\n151\n00:07:07.972 --> 00:07:10.950\nan advanced scan is just a scan\nwithout the benefit of the wizard.\n\n152\n00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.993\nYou gotta go in and\nkinda know what you're doing to set it.\n\n153\n00:07:13.993 --> 00:07:15.312\nI make it sound all impressive.\n\n154\n00:07:15.312 --> 00:07:19.474\nIt's really just a normal scan without the\nbenefit of the little preconfigured wizard\n\n155\n00:07:19.474 --> 00:07:21.194\nthat makes all the choices for you.\n\n156\n00:07:21.194 --> 00:07:24.710\nBut you can go in, you can do\na bash Shellshock Detection Scan.\n\n157\n00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.930\nSo we have a built in profile\nthat looks for the weakness and\n\n158\n00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:29.890\nvulnerability, good to know that.\n\n159\n00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.700\nGot a basic network scan, just goes out,\ndoes a quick ping sweep, looks for\n\n160\n00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.280\nactive hosts, maybe profiles a few ports.\n\n161\n00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:40.656\nGot a credentialed, path audit, or\nexcuse me, credential patch audit.\n\n162\n00:07:40.656 --> 00:07:42.874\nWe can go in, and\nauthenticate the host and\n\n163\n00:07:42.874 --> 00:07:45.961\nenumerate missing updates based\non the profile we create.\n\n164\n00:07:45.961 --> 00:07:48.899\nHow many widows updates are missing,\nhow many Apple updates,\n\n165\n00:07:48.899 --> 00:07:50.128\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n166\n00:07:50.128 --> 00:07:54.868\nWe can go in, do a host discovery,\ngo out and find hosts and open ports,\n\n167\n00:07:54.868 --> 00:07:56.136\nthings like that.\n\n168\n00:07:56.136 --> 00:08:01.427\nThere's a malware scan, you have profile\nscans for things like PCI, DSS complianc,e\n\n169\n00:08:01.427 --> 00:08:06.930\nCloud infrastructure audit scans, it's\nvery thorough, very, very robust tool.\n\n170\n00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:10.410\nIt's an incredible resource for\nthe security professional and\n\n171\n00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:14.570\nfor the incident responder to be able to\nuse and have access to a tool like this.\n\n172\n00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:18.060\nBut obviously, you have to spend money\nto get the full feature of the tool.\n\n173\n00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.600\nSo just wanna show that to you.\n\n174\n00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.290\nWe've already programmed in our scan.\n\n175\n00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:24.030\nBut if we were to create a scan,\nlet's just take a look.\n\n176\n00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:28.780\nGo into a basic network scan just\nto show you what one may look like.\n\n177\n00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.850\nThere we go.\nYou got a little form here\n\n178\n00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:31.360\nas you could see.\n\n179\n00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.450\nYou fill in the name,\nwhatever you wanna call the scan, right?\n\n180\n00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:41.810\nSo maybe something like,\nITProTV2 or whatever.\n\n181\n00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:44.540\nThen specify where you\nwanna store the scan.\n\n182\n00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:49.040\nPut in the target range of the IP or\nIP address block you wanna scan.\n\n183\n00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.860\nNotice we also have the ability to add\na file and upload a target file so\n\n184\n00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:56.540\nwe can have essentially a spreadsheet or\na document that would upload and\n\n185\n00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:57.280\ngive us a range.\n\n186\n00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.070\nSo that's nice.\n\n187\n00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.940\nWe can do that if we're doing\na comma separated value.\n\n188\n00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.690\nParse solution there.\n\n189\n00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:06.010\nWe go ahead and we could schedule that,\nset that up, enable scheduling,\n\n190\n00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:09.330\nput a little calendar out there, figure\nout when we want to automate and run that.\n\n191\n00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.670\nWe've got some notification options,\nright?\n\n192\n00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:15.870\nSet up our SMTP server so\nwe have a notification coming back to us.\n\n193\n00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:16.740\nWe could set that up.\n\n194\n00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:20.280\nWe can also filter our results so\nwe can go in and\n\n195\n00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.880\ndo that and filter out certain things and\nadd others.\n\n196\n00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:23.506\nSo that's nice.\n\n197\n00:09:23.506 --> 00:09:28.060\nStack multiple email recipients in there\nso we can send that to one or more people.\n\n198\n00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:32.440\nDiscovering we go in, just scroll\ndown here so you could take a look.\n\n199\n00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:36.731\nAnd we have the different scan types\nthat are available to us in this\n\n200\n00:09:36.731 --> 00:09:38.135\nparticular choice for basic.\n\n201\n00:09:38.135 --> 00:09:40.918\nEssentially a port scan common,\nport scan all, or\n\n202\n00:09:40.918 --> 00:09:43.457\ncustom custom mean just\ndefine the port list.\n\n203\n00:09:43.457 --> 00:09:48.180\nAnywhere from one port, up to 65,535,\nyou decide what you wanna do.\n\n204\n00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:52.840\nWe have the well known ports, which\nare the ones that are the common ones, and\n\n205\n00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:53.910\nthen a more robust skin.\n\n206\n00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:58.270\nSo, you figure all that out, and you'll\nsee that we're going to ping using TCP,\n\n207\n00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:00.470\nlooking at ARP and things of that nature.\n\n208\n00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.850\nAnd then when we're done,\nwe can look at some report items, right?\n\n209\n00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:08.030\nSo we'll be able to go in and specify\nhow we want the report to be processed.\n\n210\n00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:12.080\nShow missing patches that may have been\nsuperseded, display and designate a host\n\n211\n00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.671\nby their DNS name, so you have varies\noptions right so all that's good.\n\n212\n00:10:15.671 --> 00:10:19.133\nAnd then in this case under advanced,\nwe can go in and\n\n213\n00:10:19.133 --> 00:10:21.897\nspecify are we gonna scan the normal way?\n\n214\n00:10:21.897 --> 00:10:26.462\nAnd it gives you profile what the normal\nscan is, 30 simultaneous host max,\n\n215\n00:10:26.462 --> 00:10:28.930\n4 simultaneous checks per host max.\n\n216\n00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:32.450\nFive second network timeout,\nor do we wanna modify that and\n\n217\n00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:36.310\ndo a little bandwidth option where we\nmay not have so many hosts running,\n\n218\n00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:38.390\nmaybe not as much simultaneous activity.\n\n219\n00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:41.180\nSo pretty detailed when\nyou think about it.\n\n220\n00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:44.550\nWe got the ability just about to\ncustomize every aspect of this thing.\n\n221\n00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:45.900\nAnd this is the basic one.\n\n222\n00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.850\nIf you wanted to do the customer advanced\none, you'd have access to every one of\n\n223\n00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:50.570\nthese features and\nbe able to program them in depth.\n\n224\n00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:52.530\nSo this is kind of nice.\n\n225\n00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:56.190\nSo we're gonna obviously skip that\nbecause we've already done that.\n\n226\n00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:01.910\nWe're just gonna go back in, go to our\nscanner and we're gonna go take a look.\n\n227\n00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:06.360\nAnd what we'll do here is just one second,\nlet me scroll back up here.\n\n228\n00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.440\nAnd let's just go in here to scans and\nthen we'll pull up our active scan and\n\n229\n00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.230\ntake a look at what's\nactually going on and\n\n230\n00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:13.810\njust get a little information about it.\n\n231\n00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:14.860\nSo, we'll click on it.\n\n232\n00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.130\nOne of the nice things I\nlike about this as well and\n\n233\n00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:18.370\nI've been showing this to Daniel on and\n\n234\n00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:21.630\noff, behind the scenes a couple of\ntimes as we've been getting ready for\n\n235\n00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:24.638\nother episodes, is, you know, it's just\nbuilding and it's running in real time.\n\n236\n00:11:24.638 --> 00:11:28.850\nSo I could go in while the scan's running\nand I can actually take a look at it And\n\n237\n00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:31.040\nI can see what's happening which is nice.\n\n238\n00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.048\nAnd so you could see here that I've\ngot a list of all the hosts, and\n\n239\n00:11:34.048 --> 00:11:36.151\nwe would scroll down,\nwe would see them all.\n\n240\n00:11:36.151 --> 00:11:40.130\nBut there's currently 155 hosts\nthat have been recognized.\n\n241\n00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:45.310\nThere are 249, 250 vulnerabilities\nthat have been identified.\n\n242\n00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:50.900\nWe have nine remediation items\nthat are recommended and\n\n243\n00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:54.670\nwe have information about, that we got\na little scan detail broken out here.\n\n244\n00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:58.840\nGot a nice little colored chart that\nbreaks out and shows us a bunch of stuff.\n\n245\n00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.680\nI can highlight any one area and\n\n246\n00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:05.130\nI could see 55% of the vulnerabilities\nare just information related.\n\n247\n00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:07.295\nHey, you're running this,\nhey are you aware of that?\n\n248\n00:12:07.295 --> 00:12:11.260\n12% seem to be critical,\nbased on whatever criteria we're using.\n\n249\n00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:15.400\nYou could see on any one machine,\nwe've got a color coded bar here for\n\n250\n00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.360\nall the vulnerabilities\nthat may have been found.\n\n251\n00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.426\nAnd it breaks down the number for\nus by each one.\n\n252\n00:12:19.426 --> 00:12:24.220\n6% are low, 16% are medium,\netc, high and critical.\n\n253\n00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.580\nSo it's nice.\n\n254\n00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:29.570\nIt gives us all this information and\nallows us to figure that out.\n\n255\n00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.580\nIn addition,\nI can pull up any one machine,\n\n256\n00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.250\nlet's just grab this one as one example.\n\n257\n00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:40.793\nAnd you'll see that I can work\nmy way down and as I do that,\n\n258\n00:12:40.793 --> 00:12:43.641\nit gives me some information here.\n\n259\n00:12:43.641 --> 00:12:48.017\nIt tells me the MAC address,\nthe IP, shows me the elapsed time,\n\n260\n00:12:48.017 --> 00:12:50.600\nshows me the information on this.\n\n261\n00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.070\nBreaks down the vulnerabilities for\n\n262\n00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:54.980\nme, based on the percentage\non the individual machine.\n\n263\n00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:58.680\nTells me what they are,\nwe have an OpenSSL vulnerability,\n\n264\n00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:03.740\nwe have a VNC server on authenticated\naccess, and have a share mountable.\n\n265\n00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:07.560\nWhatever the case may be, you can just go\nthrough and kinda see every one of these.\n\n266\n00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.350\nAnd it tells you what they are.\n\n267\n00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:13.000\nAnd as we go down, we can see\nthe information ones down below.\n\n268\n00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.960\nShows us device type,\nethernet card manufacturer detection,\n\n269\n00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.830\niSCSI target detection,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n270\n00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:21.450\nAnd if we wanna drill in and\n\n271\n00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:24.080\ntake a look at any one of these,\nwe could go bring that up.\n\n272\n00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.550\nSay, okay, for this particular one, for\n\n273\n00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:30.090\nethernet card manufacturer detection,\ncan actually take a look.\n\n274\n00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:31.549\nAnd we can see what's going on there.\n\n275\n00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:33.456\nWe can see information.\n\n276\n00:13:33.456 --> 00:13:36.940\nIt's not a risk,\nit's just simply an information item.\n\n277\n00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:40.630\nAnd it just tells us a little bit about\nthis and tells us what it is, right?\n\n278\n00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:45.050\nAnd so it's nice because we can\ngo through and we can see and\n\n279\n00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:48.460\ndrill down in great detail on\nwhat all of these things are.\n\n280\n00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:51.600\nNow Nessus is not the only scanner out\nthere that does vulnerability assessment.\n\n281\n00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:56.210\nI mentioned Saint, there are many others\nthat are out there that you can use.\n\n282\n00:13:56.210 --> 00:14:00.420\nThere's a whole bunch of them, a lot of\nthem almost [INAUDIBLE] are cloud-based\n\n283\n00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.970\nand you certainly can leverage them in\nreal time through the Internet, through\n\n284\n00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:08.380\nthe World Wide We,b as well as a locally\ninstalled, on-prem hosted kind of thing.\n\n285\n00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.531\nYou have options and\noptions are always a good thing.\n\n286\n00:14:10.531 --> 00:14:15.224\nBut the fact that we can run this kind of\na scan and get information like this back,\n\n287\n00:14:15.224 --> 00:14:19.170\neven in a demo environment,\nlet alone in the real world, is great.\n\n288\n00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:21.910\nAnd we want to obviously understand\nthat and be aware of that.\n\n289\n00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:25.210\nThere's my laptop machine that\nwe're demoing off of right there.\n\n290\n00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:27.060\nThat's the one that I'm actually using.\n\n291\n00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:30.530\nSo that's my machine that I'm running, so\nit scans me as well as everybody else.\n\n292\n00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:34.020\nBecause you have to be, you know\nautocratic to a point, could also be\n\n293\n00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:37.390\ndemocratic and say, well I'm gonna scan\neverybody, I should scan myself as well.\n\n294\n00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:39.330\nSo lead by example as we say.\n\n295\n00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:40.924\nSo, you could see all of that here.\n\n296\n00:14:40.924 --> 00:14:43.840\nSo this is at a high level\nwhat Nessus would look like.\n\n297\n00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:47.940\nWe can then take this information,\nwe could export it, create reports,\n\n298\n00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:51.170\nfilter it, share with people,\ndo all sorts of stuff with this, right?\n\n299\n00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:54.692\nSo, hopefully, from your perspective,\n[INAUDIBLE] pretty interesting tool.\n\n300\n00:14:54.692 --> 00:14:57.560\n&gt;&gt; The brass loves stuff like this,\nbecause there's pictures and there's\n\n301\n00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:01.460\ncolors, it's all sharp, and it really\nhelps them out cuz they need that [LAUGH]\n\n302\n00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.390\n&gt;&gt; It does, no, they do, absolutely right.\n\n303\n00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:07.970\nIt's the shiny object that everybody\nloves to be able to pick up, turn around,\n\n304\n00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:08.970\nand play with, right?\n\n305\n00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:10.470\nBecause it's compelling, right?\n\n306\n00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:12.510\nSo we wanna understand that, see that.\n\n307\n00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:15.260\nSo that's an example of\na vulnerability scanner.\n\n308\n00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:15.760\nWhat about.\n\n309\n00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:22.370\nLet's take a look at a ooh, a command\nline item that we have run in here.\n\n310\n00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:25.220\nWe're in right now EnGrip.\n\n311\n00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:26.250\nYou may or may not be familiar.\n\n312\n00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:28.970\nLet me just scroll up here real quick,\nright.\n\n313\n00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:31.980\nSo EnGrip command line tool,\nI'm running it in Windows, as you can see.\n\n314\n00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:34.786\nIf you are going to run this by the way,\nyou download it from the web,\n\n315\n00:15:34.786 --> 00:15:36.965\ndrop it into a root directory\nwhere you wanna put it.\n\n316\n00:15:36.965 --> 00:15:40.475\nJust don't make the mistake of running\nit with a normal command prompt [LAUGH].\n\n317\n00:15:40.475 --> 00:15:43.099\nYou need that running with admin\ncredentials to be able to see\n\n318\n00:15:43.099 --> 00:15:43.980\nanything of value.\n\n319\n00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:47.456\nYou could see I've made sure I had the\nadministrator credentials associated with\n\n320\n00:15:47.456 --> 00:15:50.140\nmy command prompt,\notherwise you're not gonna get very far.\n\n321\n00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:53.681\nAnd EnGrip has been running in\nthe background, it's just listening and\n\n322\n00:15:53.681 --> 00:15:56.828\nreporting out on packets it finds\nthat are streaming in and out.\n\n323\n00:15:56.828 --> 00:15:58.991\nAnd you can see we're just finding stuff.\n\n324\n00:15:58.991 --> 00:16:02.476\nThere's a browser request for\nsome information coming in right there,\n\n325\n00:16:02.476 --> 00:16:05.200\nso there's a bunch of\ndifferent stuff happening.\n\n326\n00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.537\nI'm gonna break this real quick, right?\n\n327\n00:16:06.537 --> 00:16:10.868\nYou can see I've received 11,300 packets,\n0 have been dropped.\n\n328\n00:16:10.868 --> 00:16:16.017\nThat's because I have have hands of\nVelcro, they drop nothing, all right?\n\n329\n00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:22.650\nBut what we wanna see with ngrep is not so\nmuch the output, because that's easy.\n\n330\n00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:23.411\nIt's just packets streaming by.\n\n331\n00:16:23.411 --> 00:16:26.251\nIf you've used Snort,\nused ngrep, used ntop,\n\n332\n00:16:26.251 --> 00:16:30.450\nany of these command line tools,\nyou've seen this kind of stuff.\n\n333\n00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:32.040\nAnd you've seen that this\nis just what happens.\n\n334\n00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.120\nIt goes streaming through.\n\n335\n00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.870\nCan you output this to a file?\n\n336\n00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:37.230\nAbsolutely, we're gonna take\na look at the help file and\n\n337\n00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:38.260\njust talk about some of this.\n\n338\n00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:42.120\nBut the value of tools like this\nis understanding the options\n\n339\n00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.790\nthat you have when you use them.\n\n340\n00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:46.877\nAlways, without exception,\nalways read the help file, right.\n\n341\n00:16:46.877 --> 00:16:51.150\n\\?, is your friend when it\ncomes to tools like this.\n\n342\n00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:52.180\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot of words, Adam.\n\n343\n00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:53.833\n\\??\n\n344\n00:16:53.833 --> 00:16:54.797\n&gt;&gt; No, look on the screen.\n\n345\n00:16:54.797 --> 00:16:55.830\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Those are the options.\n\n346\n00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:57.663\nThat's why I said you have\nto read the help file,\n\n347\n00:16:57.663 --> 00:16:59.871\nbecause there's no way I could\nexplain all of that to you.\n\n348\n00:16:59.871 --> 00:17:00.627\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But these are all\n\n349\n00:17:00.627 --> 00:17:03.466\nthe switches that help us to\nunderstand how a tool like this works.\n\n350\n00:17:03.466 --> 00:17:06.060\nAnd it sounds easy on the surface.\n\n351\n00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.020\nHey, just run ngrep and\nboom, you're good, right?\n\n352\n00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:12.280\nBut there's, as Daniel said,\nprobably 20, 25 options in there\n\n353\n00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:15.072\nthat you can use in order to get\nthis thing to do what you want.\n\n354\n00:17:15.072 --> 00:17:16.690\nAnd unless you take a look at it,\n\n355\n00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:20.750\nchances are good it's not really gonna\nbehave the way you're hoping for.\n\n356\n00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:25.510\nSo there's quite a bit of stuff here, and\nyou should take some time to take a look.\n\n357\n00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:31.328\nSo something like, for instance, this,\nright, where we do ngrep and we do -w.\n\n358\n00:17:31.328 --> 00:17:34.919\nAnd notice, by the way,\nthese are case sensitive.\n\n359\n00:17:34.919 --> 00:17:37.636\nI would just highlight, right,\n\n360\n00:17:37.636 --> 00:17:42.972\nthat capital W there versus lowercase W,\nthere may or may not be,\n\n361\n00:17:42.972 --> 00:17:48.340\nand there is, as you can see here,\na lowercase w right up here.\n\n362\n00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:54.270\nWhich is the word regex, right, expression\nmust match as a word versus capital W,\n\n363\n00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:58.670\nwhich is set the dump format to by lines,\nsingle, whatever.\n\n364\n00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:01.890\nYou gotta make sure you use the\nappropriate switch if it's case sensitive.\n\n365\n00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:04.980\nOtherwise you're not getting\nthe right output here, right?\n\n366\n00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:06.660\nSo make sure you're doing that.\n\n367\n00:18:08.375 --> 00:18:13.510\nIf we do by line, let's say, and\nwe do port for port number, and\n\n368\n00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:19.469\nwe specify, we don't really have a web\nitem open right now, but we could do 443.\n\n369\n00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:25.445\nAnd we'll then begin to be starting to\nfilter your CIP or IPv6 and port 443.\n\n370\n00:18:25.445 --> 00:18:28.584\nSo any traffic coming and\ngoing on port 443 in and\n\n371\n00:18:28.584 --> 00:18:31.300\nout of this machine\nwould then be captured.\n\n372\n00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:35.580\nAnd then what we would have to do is,\nobviously, we'd have to come down here.\n\n373\n00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:38.440\nWe would have to go in and open up.\n\n374\n00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.150\nSo let's just go in and\ndo this real quick.\n\n375\n00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:43.585\nAnd we'll open up and\nhave something running here.\n\n376\n00:18:43.585 --> 00:18:47.500\nWe just click and bring up this.\n\n377\n00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:53.834\nAnd let's go in and let's do, a secure-\n&gt;&gt; Google is secure, isn't it?\n\n378\n00:18:53.834 --> 00:18:55.920\nIsn't it HTTPS?\n\n379\n00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:56.960\n&gt;&gt; It may be by default, I don't know.\n\n380\n00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:57.830\n&gt;&gt; I think it is.\n\n381\n00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:58.610\n&gt;&gt; It's not coming up.\n\n382\n00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:01.390\nYou see, it blocks the protocol for\nthe homepage.\n\n383\n00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:03.733\nSo I know bank sites are secure so\nit's generic.\n\n384\n00:19:03.733 --> 00:19:04.308\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n385\n00:19:04.308 --> 00:19:06.948\n&gt;&gt; You know for\na fact that the bank site is secure.\n\n386\n00:19:06.948 --> 00:19:10.231\nSo you know if you've just clicked through\na couple of these screens you'll see\n\n387\n00:19:10.231 --> 00:19:11.170\neverything is HTTPS.\n\n388\n00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:15.000\nWe know we're generating some traffic, not\nthat we're gonna do anything there, but\n\n389\n00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.020\njust we're generating packets in and out.\n\n390\n00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:19.905\nWe know for a fact that this kind\nof stuff is happening, right?\n\n391\n00:19:19.905 --> 00:19:25.840\nAnd so if we then go back and\nwe take a look in here,\n\n392\n00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.220\nright, we're not seeing Apple because\nthey didn't bother to output it.\n\n393\n00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:30.220\nBut we are capturing those packets.\n\n394\n00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:32.005\nThey are in there.\nAnd if I stop the capture,\n\n395\n00:19:32.005 --> 00:19:34.681\nyou'll see that I have\n63 packets received.\n\n396\n00:19:34.681 --> 00:19:36.560\nSo I'm getting that traffic.\n\n397\n00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:39.860\nIt's just a matter of using the switches\nto understand how to output it.\n\n398\n00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:45.630\nI could use a -f out to file to actually\ndrop that traffic into a file buffer.\n\n399\n00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:48.210\nI could just port it with a pipe and\noutput.\n\n400\n00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:50.090\nIt's all sorts of\ndifferent stuff I can do.\n\n401\n00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:54.146\nBut ngrep will allow me to grab network\npackets the old-fashioned hardcore way,\n\n402\n00:19:54.146 --> 00:19:57.161\nright, from the command line,\nand then be able to see them.\n\n403\n00:19:57.161 --> 00:20:00.032\nBut a lot of people are not\nreal comfortable doing\n\n404\n00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:02.780\nstuff like this because\nit's a command line.\n\n405\n00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:06.290\nIt may be hard to understand how to\nbe able to work with the packets,\n\n406\n00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:08.370\nmaybe hard to understand what\nthe packets are telling us.\n\n407\n00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:13.070\nSo it may be easier to use a graphical\ninterface to do some screen capture, and\n\n408\n00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:14.130\na packet capture, right?\n\n409\n00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:17.005\nSo let's go down here and\nlet's do the following.\n\n410\n00:20:17.005 --> 00:20:19.100\nActually, go back up here and\ndo the following.\n\n411\n00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:20.400\nLet's get out of there.\n\n412\n00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:24.220\nAnd let's spin up our\nold friend Wireshark.\n\n413\n00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:26.680\nAnd let's bring up our protocol analyzer.\n\n414\n00:20:28.075 --> 00:20:30.700\nSame idea as ngrep but we have a graphical\ninterface that's going to make it\n\n415\n00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:33.190\neasier for\nus to capture the traffic, right?\n\n416\n00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:34.391\nSo let's take a look up here.\n\n417\n00:20:34.391 --> 00:20:38.506\nYou'll see when we start this up that we\nare gonna have a nice little interface\n\n418\n00:20:38.506 --> 00:20:40.230\nlist here, which I like.\n\n419\n00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:42.380\nIt's nice,\nit's got all the different adapters.\n\n420\n00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:45.605\nAnd I can go in, highlight the adapter\nthat I wanna use, in this case,\n\n421\n00:20:45.605 --> 00:20:48.750\nmy LAN connection, right,\nor whatever it may be.\n\n422\n00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:54.050\nAnd I can go in and I can then decide on\nmy capture options if I wanna do that.\n\n423\n00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:57.630\nOr I could just go ahead and click\nStart right here and start a capture.\n\n424\n00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:58.606\nSo let me just start the capture up.\n\n425\n00:21:01.049 --> 00:21:01.720\nThere we go.\n\n426\n00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.313\nAnd we're just gonna start\nbringing traffic in.\n\n427\n00:21:03.313 --> 00:21:07.577\nAnd we'll see that there's a bunch of\ntraffic streaming in on the capture\n\n428\n00:21:07.577 --> 00:21:10.690\ninterface, and\nwe're able to see all this traffic.\n\n429\n00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:13.595\nIt's color coding, certain things are\nbeing filtered and highlighted as we go.\n\n430\n00:21:13.595 --> 00:21:17.620\nAnd we can just watch what's going on\nover here, and see all sorts of stuff.\n\n431\n00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:21.350\nThere's Dropbox traffic,\nthere's SSL traffic,\n\n432\n00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:24.250\nthere's message of the day traffic,\nthere's sync traffic.\n\n433\n00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:24.931\nThere's all sorts of stuff.\n\n434\n00:21:24.931 --> 00:21:28.007\nAnd once I've got a certain\namount of traffic, or\n\n435\n00:21:28.007 --> 00:21:32.987\nhowever much I may wanna capture, hard\nto say, I could stop the buffer capture,\n\n436\n00:21:32.987 --> 00:21:37.100\nhit Stop and essentially just go ahead and\npull out a packet.\n\n437\n00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:39.290\nLet's just say this one right here.\n\n438\n00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:44.445\nThis looks like it is a SYN handshake of\nsome kind or a SYN packet of some kind.\n\n439\n00:21:44.445 --> 00:21:48.014\nAnd we can go ahead and we can\nexamine that packet and open it up and\n\n440\n00:21:48.014 --> 00:21:50.000\nsee what's going on with it.\n\n441\n00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.940\nSo we can see information\nabout the frame down here.\n\n442\n00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:55.580\nJust bring this down,\na little bit easier for you to see.\n\n443\n00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:58.470\nCan we go full screen here so\nI can just have a little bit more room?\n\n444\n00:21:58.470 --> 00:21:59.280\nThere we go.\n\n445\n00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:03.360\nAnd you can see that I can\nopen up the frame buffer.\n\n446\n00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:06.860\nI can see the top or\nthe header of the information frame.\n\n447\n00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:08.600\nI can interact with it,\nsee what's going on.\n\n448\n00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.230\nI see the frame number there.\n\n449\n00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:11.872\nI can see the delta capture.\n\n450\n00:22:11.872 --> 00:22:13.370\nTime offsets, so\n\n451\n00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:18.870\nI can tell when the packet came in\nversus what was going before and after.\n\n452\n00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:20.930\nI can see that it's an ethernet frame.\n\n453\n00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:23.690\nI can see that it's an IPv4 frame,\n\n454\n00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:26.950\nsource and destination,\nIP address are right there.\n\n455\n00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:30.420\nI can see that there's also TCP\ninformation there, source port,\n\n456\n00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:32.280\ndestination port and sequencing.\n\n457\n00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:35.980\nSo I can open up any portion of\nthe packet and I can look at and\n\n458\n00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:37.650\nsee what flags are set.\n\n459\n00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:42.080\nThis is a SYN packet, so I'm gonna see\nthe SYN flag is set right there, so\n\n460\n00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:42.840\nI can see that.\n\n461\n00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:46.390\nMaybe part of a three-way handshake\nperhaps, hard to say for sure, but\n\n462\n00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:48.750\nmost likely that is part\nof what's going on.\n\n463\n00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:51.690\nAnd I can see the Window's size value,\n\n464\n00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:55.970\nI can see information about whether\nthe checksum has been verified or not.\n\n465\n00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:58.040\nSo I can delve into any\none of these packets or\n\n466\n00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:01.630\ngroups of them and\nexamine them in realtime using this tool.\n\n467\n00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:05.660\nI have the ability to do an analysis\nusing the Analysis menu,\n\n468\n00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:10.060\napply column filters, apply all sorts of\ndifferent ways of seeing this information.\n\n469\n00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:11.850\nI can look for enabled protocols.\n\n470\n00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:16.520\nI can use a decode option to look at hex\nand bring that out and understand that.\n\n471\n00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.470\nI can look at statistics.\n\n472\n00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:21.970\nSo I can go and\nget summary information on the capture.\n\n473\n00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:26.440\n&gt;&gt; I love being able to do that follow\nTCP stream and just look at the entire\n\n474\n00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.291\nconversation in one big window and\ngo that's what's going on.\n\n475\n00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:31.920\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yes, so you can go in.\n\n476\n00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:36.060\nYou can see here, right, we could see\nif we go in and pull up conversations,\n\n477\n00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:37.390\nDan was just suggesting.\n\n478\n00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:41.180\nI could look at ethernet packets,\nsee your address direction back and forth.\n\n479\n00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:46.131\nSee where stuff's coming to and\nfrom, IPv4, IPv6, TCP UDP.\n\n480\n00:23:46.131 --> 00:23:49.592\nNice thing about this is I can see that\nthe things that are grayed out means\n\n481\n00:23:49.592 --> 00:23:52.713\nthere's none of that kind of\ntraffic on the site, no Bluetooth,\n\n482\n00:23:52.713 --> 00:23:56.839\nwhich Shouldn't be surprising, because\nI'm not using bluetooth on this machine.\n\n483\n00:23:56.839 --> 00:24:02.753\nI have no fiber, I have no FDDI,\nno wireless, no 8O2.11, no IPX.\n\n484\n00:24:02.753 --> 00:24:04.633\nCuz you see that very often these days,\nright?\n\n485\n00:24:04.633 --> 00:24:05.758\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Every day, right.\n\n486\n00:24:05.758 --> 00:24:07.586\n&gt;&gt; NCPRCP, etc.\n\n487\n00:24:07.586 --> 00:24:08.347\nNo token ring, right?\n\n488\n00:24:08.347 --> 00:24:12.091\nSo I can see that there's none\nof that kind of traffic, so\n\n489\n00:24:12.091 --> 00:24:15.523\nit's nice to be able to go\nin as not only a responder.\n\n490\n00:24:15.523 --> 00:24:20.425\nBut also a somebody who is looking to find\ninformation and able to profile here.\n\n491\n00:24:20.425 --> 00:24:23.951\nThe point that Daniel was making about be\nable to highlight something and follow\n\n492\n00:24:23.951 --> 00:24:27.491\nstream down here, we can actually follow\nthe conversation take a look at that.\n\n493\n00:24:27.491 --> 00:24:30.170\nI like this [INAUDIBLE],\nI also mention other tool,\n\n494\n00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:32.426\npacketize from what chemistry that I use.\n\n495\n00:24:32.426 --> 00:24:35.926\nIt's similar to this, I like the way it\nbreaks down the traffic a little bit more,\n\n496\n00:24:35.926 --> 00:24:38.897\nit gives the graphical interface\non the breakdown and the protocol.\n\n497\n00:24:38.897 --> 00:24:42.131\nIn a slightly different way it's easier\nto see, at least from my perspective.\n\n498\n00:24:42.131 --> 00:24:44.653\nIt's a little bit easier to interact\nwith,but any one of these tools,\n\n499\n00:24:44.653 --> 00:24:45.970\nSentry does the same thing.\n\n500\n00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:48.304\nMicrosoft redesigned their\nnetwork capture program.\n\n501\n00:24:48.304 --> 00:24:52.924\nNetwork Analyser recently and Network\nMonitor, new tool interface pretty cool,\n\n502\n00:24:52.924 --> 00:24:54.318\nso it's also very nice.\n\n503\n00:24:54.318 --> 00:24:58.350\nSo pretty cool to use, so\nthis is what a typical program or\n\n504\n00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:01.379\npacket analysis solution will look like.\n\n505\n00:25:01.379 --> 00:25:05.386\nIf we're not using command line version\nlike Ngrep, but rather actually going in\n\n506\n00:25:05.386 --> 00:25:08.941\nand using something like Wireshark,\nwe'll be able to see this as well.\n\n507\n00:25:08.941 --> 00:25:11.289\nYou can see, I can quit with or\nwithout saving,\n\n508\n00:25:11.289 --> 00:25:14.772\ngetting rid of the capture if I don't\nwant it, using a tool like this.\n\n509\n00:25:14.772 --> 00:25:17.746\nI've also got the ability\nto be able to go in and\n\n510\n00:25:17.746 --> 00:25:22.799\nto do some scanning using Zenmap, the\nWindows port of Nmap as you can see here.\n\n511\n00:25:22.799 --> 00:25:25.498\nWe've gone ahead, I've gone ahead,\nI should say, and\n\n512\n00:25:25.498 --> 00:25:29.057\nI'm gonna just scroll over so we can\nsee this on the bottom here real quick.\n\n513\n00:25:29.057 --> 00:25:32.323\nThere we go, and I've gone ahead and\nI've done two scans.\n\n514\n00:25:32.323 --> 00:25:35.831\nI've scanned eccouncil.org,\nwhich is apropos and fitting.\n\n515\n00:25:35.831 --> 00:25:40.727\nIt's something we're talking about,\nEC-Council related information, and\n\n516\n00:25:40.727 --> 00:25:45.760\ndone a scan using the tool pointed it\nat the web URL, www.eccouncil.org.\n\n517\n00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:50.579\nAnd nice thing about Nmap is you choose,\nthe kind of scan you would like, so\n\n518\n00:25:50.579 --> 00:25:53.272\nintense, intense with our without UDP.\n\n519\n00:25:53.272 --> 00:25:57.490\nIntense with or without TCP,\nwhat ports, quick scan, ping scan,\n\n520\n00:25:57.490 --> 00:25:59.490\nregular scans slow scan, etc.\n\n521\n00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:03.409\nThen you hit Scan, and\nit creates the script for you,\n\n522\n00:26:03.409 --> 00:26:06.647\nit just puts out the basic language for\nyou.\n\n523\n00:26:06.647 --> 00:26:07.912\nThis one is pretty straightforward.\n\n524\n00:26:07.912 --> 00:26:11.163\nAnd then it does the scan, and\nyou can see the output of the scan here.\n\n525\n00:26:11.163 --> 00:26:16.834\nWe can see that it started up and I'm\nusing the most recent version of Nmaps,\n\n526\n00:26:16.834 --> 00:26:19.681\nversion 7.x there, as you can see.\n\n527\n00:26:19.681 --> 00:26:23.075\nIt ran and it did the prescan,\nset it up, connect it.\n\n528\n00:26:23.075 --> 00:26:28.780\nWas able to respond, fun for a port open,\nfound a host doing the ping when down.\n\n529\n00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:31.664\nDid all the different staff\nkind of summarizes it for us,\n\n530\n00:26:31.664 --> 00:26:34.540\ngives me some information\ndown here at the bottom.\n\n531\n00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:37.285\nShows me the open port,\nshows me the connection strengths.\n\n532\n00:26:37.285 --> 00:26:40.420\nShows me DNS look ups, gives me all.\n\n533\n00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:46.996\nI can go in, I can break out the details\nhere, just open this up if I want to.\n\n534\n00:26:49.928 --> 00:26:52.240\nJust take a look at some\nof the general information,\n\n535\n00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.540\ndo a little filtering if I wanna see that.\n\n536\n00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:57.982\nI can go in, look at the ports in\nthe host, see the open protocol and\n\n537\n00:26:57.982 --> 00:26:59.472\nport traffic that's here.\n\n538\n00:26:59.472 --> 00:27:02.374\nI can look at the topology,\nthis is one of the ones I like,\n\n539\n00:27:02.374 --> 00:27:06.000\nwhere I can look at the actual trace\nroute and I can see all the paths.\n\n540\n00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.131\nYou have to obviously zoom in and zoom out\nto be able to be able to make heads or\n\n541\n00:27:09.131 --> 00:27:09.942\ntails out of this.\n\n542\n00:27:09.942 --> 00:27:14.671\nYpu can move it around so it's kinda nice,\nsee what it is, stretch it out,\n\n543\n00:27:14.671 --> 00:27:15.884\ninteract with it.\n\n544\n00:27:15.884 --> 00:27:19.771\nSo you can look here and\nlook at different types of output, right?\n\n545\n00:27:19.771 --> 00:27:24.470\nSo host details, I can go in and just\nright click and move between the tabs.\n\n546\n00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:27.676\nSo I can see the host detail here,\nlooks like a little family of penguins,\n\n547\n00:27:27.676 --> 00:27:29.706\nthat clearly doesn't mean Windows, right?\n\n548\n00:27:29.706 --> 00:27:30.393\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, probably not.\n\n549\n00:27:30.393 --> 00:27:32.028\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's probably got a little Linux stuff\n\n550\n00:27:32.028 --> 00:27:32.561\ngoing on there.\n\n551\n00:27:32.561 --> 00:27:34.759\nWe can see last boot time,\nI can see up time here.\n\n552\n00:27:34.759 --> 00:27:37.079\nIt looks like number of\nports that were scanned.\n\n553\n00:27:37.079 --> 00:27:40.442\nGot an IP address, no Mac address,\nbut got the external IP.\n\n554\n00:27:40.442 --> 00:27:44.157\nCuz this is obviously a web server so\nwe're not necessarily have a front end,\n\n555\n00:27:44.157 --> 00:27:47.758\nwe may be looking at a proxy, sort of\npublished [INAUDIBLE] item probably you\n\n556\n00:27:47.758 --> 00:27:50.123\nbeing made available\nthrough a secure gateway.\n\n557\n00:27:50.123 --> 00:27:53.543\nSo you'll see we have the name here,\nwe've got the operating system,\n\n558\n00:27:53.543 --> 00:27:54.975\nmost likely a Linux variant.\n\n559\n00:27:54.975 --> 00:27:59.805\nFrom 3X to 4X on the Kernel Build roughly\noccurred to about 90% most likely, so\n\n560\n00:27:59.805 --> 00:28:01.780\nvery likely that's the case.\n\n561\n00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:06.550\nGot the port center available,\ngot the OS class or\n\n562\n00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:09.940\nclasses that we think is being use,\nwe saw that.\n\n563\n00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:14.353\nGot the TCP sequence, so\nI could see information in here.\n\n564\n00:28:14.353 --> 00:28:20.319\nTCP and IPID Sequence, I think I just\nget some general information about this.\n\n565\n00:28:20.319 --> 00:28:24.090\nI can see the kind of scan or\nscans that have been run.\n\n566\n00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:29.012\nI also did a scan on just a local gateway\nhere on our network and did that as well.\n\n567\n00:28:29.012 --> 00:28:32.022\nYou can see this scan,\ngot some open ports on this one, and\n\n568\n00:28:32.022 --> 00:28:34.550\nwe can see just general\ninformation about this.\n\n569\n00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:37.667\nSo it's very simple to go out and\nscan and stack up those scans and\n\n570\n00:28:37.667 --> 00:28:40.451\nfind one or more machines and\nreport out on them, right?\n\n571\n00:28:40.451 --> 00:28:43.606\nAnd this is a pretty common tool as well,\nZenmap, don't get fooled,\n\n572\n00:28:43.606 --> 00:28:46.015\nit's Nmap it's just a Windows\nport of Nnap, right?\n\n573\n00:28:46.015 --> 00:28:48.050\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Because Nmap is many of these tools\n\n574\n00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:50.700\ndid, started life as\na Linux Unix derivative.\n\n575\n00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:53.121\nAnd eventually everybody said,\nhey that's cool, but\n\n576\n00:28:53.121 --> 00:28:55.191\nit would work great if we\ncan do this in Windows.\n\n577\n00:28:55.191 --> 00:28:57.497\nAnd as a result,\nsomebody built a front end for it and\n\n578\n00:28:57.497 --> 00:29:00.180\nthat's what we've been using for\nthe last number of years.\n\n579\n00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:01.090\nSo this is Nmap,\n\n580\n00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:04.937\nit's just Nmap with a graphical\nnice GUI that's running in Windows.\n\n581\n00:29:04.937 --> 00:29:08.450\nCall it Zenmap, and that's what you'll\nfind when you go to downloading, right?\n\n582\n00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:09.530\nBut these are examples,\n\n583\n00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:13.490\nkind of just samplings of different\ntools that we can drill through.\n\n584\n00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:19.380\nWe can use and as incident handlers,\nincident responders, incident managers.\n\n585\n00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:20.950\nWe can start profiling and\n\n586\n00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:25.100\nunderstanding network infrastructure,\nnetwork security incidents.\n\n587\n00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:29.180\nAnd better understand information that's\ngonna help us not only respond, but\n\n588\n00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:30.910\nalso to secure and defend.\n\n589\n00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:32.870\nRemember, you have the hought process,\n\n590\n00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:36.399\nwe have to engage in when we're thinking\nabout these kinds of activities.\n\n591\n00:29:36.399 --> 00:29:39.610\nAnd also the kinds of tools that\nwe wanna put into our toolbox.\n\n592\n00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:41.004\nDon't be surprised by the way,\n\n593\n00:29:41.004 --> 00:29:44.424\nif you're taking the ECIH exam if you're\nasked about one or more of the tools.\n\n594\n00:29:44.424 --> 00:29:46.560\nMaybe not the exact ones\nwe've talked about.\n\n595\n00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.819\nYou may not get asked about\nNEFSYS in its current form.\n\n596\n00:29:48.819 --> 00:29:51.160\nMaybe they'll ask you about another tool,\nwho knows?\n\n597\n00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:54.644\nBut they may very well, and I would think\nvery highly likely that you'll get asked\n\n598\n00:29:54.644 --> 00:29:56.579\nabout a vulnerability\nscanner of some kind.\n\n599\n00:29:56.579 --> 00:29:58.360\nGenerically as a class of tools,\n\n600\n00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:02.753\nvery likely you will get asked about a\nnetwork capture program, a network monitor\n\n601\n00:30:02.753 --> 00:30:06.760\nprogram of some kind like what we\nwere just looking at with Wireshark.\n\n602\n00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:11.190\nVery likely, you'll get asked about or\nas a category of tools be asked to\n\n603\n00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:14.960\nunderstand, interact with and talk about\na tool that does network profiling and\n\n604\n00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.780\nscanning like Zenmap or\nwhatever tool you may use.\n\n605\n00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:20.128\nIn other words, it may not so\nmuch be an individual tool.\n\n606\n00:30:20.128 --> 00:30:22.098\nBut the class of tools\nin the categories and\n\n607\n00:30:22.098 --> 00:30:25.930\nthe types that incident handlers\nare expected to be comfortable with.\n\n608\n00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:27.150\nI would be very,\n\n609\n00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:33.040\nvery focussed on the fact that you gonna\nbe asked about different types of tools.\n\n610\n00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:36.511\nWe gave you a list in the and some common\nones, give you more explanation of them.\n\n611\n00:30:36.511 --> 00:30:39.398\nAlways got to pay attention to that, but\nif you 're not comfortable with using\n\n612\n00:30:39.398 --> 00:30:42.320\nthese tools, and you may not be and\nthere's nothing wrong with that.\n\n613\n00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.460\nNobody says you have to use these tools.\n\n614\n00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:48.900\nBut I am suggesting to you that you start\npracticing with tools in these categories,\n\n615\n00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:51.666\nwhichever ones you may feel\nmost comfortable with.\n\n616\n00:30:51.666 --> 00:30:55.143\nAnd get to know them, understand them,\nunderstand how they work,\n\n617\n00:30:55.143 --> 00:30:57.339\nunderstand the logic of why they work, and\n\n618\n00:30:57.339 --> 00:31:01.200\nunderstand how to use them to your\nadvantage as an incident responder.\n\n619\n00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.105\nThat is gonna be very\nvaluable information for you.\n\n620\n00:31:03.105 --> 00:31:05.570\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right,\nAdam hits the nail right on the head.\n\n621\n00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:10.170\nYou have to build up a repertoire like he\nsaid, maybe not these tools specifically,\n\n622\n00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:13.280\nbut at least inside of their\ncategories in which they are used.\n\n623\n00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:16.860\nOf course, the ones we're showing you\nare probably the most commonly used ones.\n\n624\n00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:19.800\nSo it probably wouldn't hurt\nyou to download, install,\n\n625\n00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:21.820\nplay with and start working with this.\n\n626\n00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:24.390\nYou can scan your own machine\nall day long and no one cares,\n\n627\n00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:26.560\nno one's are gonna throw you in jail for\nthat.\n\n628\n00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:29.130\nSo practice on your own machines,\nmaybe build a small virtual lab.\n\n629\n00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:31.869\nYou've got some spare laptops or\nsomething laying around,\n\n630\n00:31:31.869 --> 00:31:33.650\nyou can play with this stuff.\n\n631\n00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:34.980\nAnd don't forget, read the manual.\n\n632\n00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:38.680\nI kind of made a joke about\nthe output being very verbose.\n\n633\n00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:41.940\nYeah, it is, and the manuals tend\nto be very long and complex.\n\n634\n00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:47.140\nBut if you even grasp 10% of it, 50% of\nit, you are a force to be reckoned with.\n\n635\n00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:49.941\nMost people don't understand half\nthe things that their tools can do.\n\n636\n00:31:49.941 --> 00:31:54.359\nSo if you get behind the wheel of\nthat Ferrari, you're gonna be a very,\n\n637\n00:31:54.359 --> 00:31:56.000\nvery well versed person.\n\n638\n00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000\nAnd something somebody's gonna\nwant to have in their club.\n\n639\n00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.050\nThat being said Adam,\nwe do appreciate you joining us.\n\n640\n00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:05.058\nAnd showing us some of the tools that\nmight be available to us that we might\n\n641\n00:32:05.058 --> 00:32:08.520\nneed to use or be aware of for\nour exam and real life as well.\n\n642\n00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.514\nBut it is that time for\nus to go ahead and sign off.\n\n643\n00:32:11.514 --> 00:32:14.164\nFor ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n644\n00:32:14.164 --> 00:32:15.162\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n645\n00:32:15.162 --> 00:32:16.425\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n646\n00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:24.412\n[MUSIC]\n\n647\n00:32:24.412 --> 00:32:27.130\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

00:00:12.142\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.142 --> 00:00:13.553\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n5\n00:00:13.553 --> 00:00:16.550\nAnd welcome to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.112\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:20.112 --> 00:00:22.970\nwe are coming back with\nmore on our ECIH series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.027\nAnd of course, joining us in the studio,\nyet again, our sensei, our mentor.\n\n9\n00:00:26.027 --> 00:00:28.840\nThat is, the good man himself,\nMr Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.470\nAdam, welcome back,\nmy man, how's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.500\n[LAUGH].\n\n12\n00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.220\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\nMy Kung Fu is strong today.\n\n13\n00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.890\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n14\n00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.910\n&gt;&gt; My Kung Fu is strong, and\nhopefully yours will be as well.\n\n15\n00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.365\nBecause we are here to talk about\na topic that requires strong Kung Fu,\n\n16\n00:00:42.365 --> 00:00:44.090\nstrong karma.\n\n17\n00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.540\nWe need to talk about malware, viruses,\nand things that go bump in the night,\n\n18\n00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.370\nas they say.\n\n19\n00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.620\nNo good incident response, no good\nincident handling, no good incident\n\n20\n00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.480\nmanagement story that we can tell, we can\ndiscuss and/or relate doesn't somewhere\n\n21\n00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.875\nhave in it the idea that there was malware\non a machine or malware somewhere in\n\n22\n00:01:03.875 --> 00:01:07.800\na system that led to a compromise\nthat ultimately, we had to address.\n\n23\n00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.958\nIf you think about the way that more often\nthan not, we are called into action when\n\n24\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:15.827\nwe are doing incident response,\nit's because something has gone wrong.\n\n25\n00:01:15.827 --> 00:01:19.220\nI mean, let's be honest, when things\ngo right, we don't have a lot to do.\n\n26\n00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.567\nWe've talked about being prepared.\n\n27\n00:01:20.567 --> 00:01:24.402\nWe've talked about the importance\nof making sure that we plan so\n\n28\n00:01:24.402 --> 00:01:29.850\nthat the bad things don't happen, and when\nthey do, that we minimize their impact.\n\n29\n00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.170\nBut we know that really the fun begins\nwhen the bad stuff starts happening and\n\n30\n00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.940\nwe have to go respond and figure out\nhow to not only stop the bad stuff but\n\n31\n00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.640\nthen put things back to normal.\n\n32\n00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.510\nAnd a lot of the time,\nnot all the time, but a very,\n\n33\n00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.470\nvery large percentage of the time,\nthe bad things we wind up stopping,\n\n34\n00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.980\nthe things we have to figure out how to\ntake apart and put back together again and\n\n35\n00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.100\nultimately return to normalcy through,\ninvolve malware in one form or another.\n\n36\n00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.500\nWe used to talk years ago about malware\nas being a separate category in and\n\n37\n00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.930\nof itself and then we would talk about\nthings like Trojans and viruses and worms.\n\n38\n00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.850\nToday when we say malware,\nwe generically mean pretty much any kind\n\n39\n00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.000\nof software that has a negative\nimpact that is in some way going to\n\n40\n00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000\ndeliver and/or propagate a payload\nthat leads to compromise.\n\n41\n00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.990\nAnd so malware itself is a descriptive\ncategory and a term that encompasses many\n\n42\n00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.260\nof the things that we would, in some\ncases, depending on how far back we go,\n\n43\n00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.850\nperhaps break out and\ntalk about separately as well.\n\n44\n00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:39.030\nViruses, trojans, worms,\nthings of that nature, spyware, adware,\n\n45\n00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.230\nall these kinds of things, all generically\ntoday come up under the guise of malware.\n\n46\n00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.550\nSo as we begin to talk about malware,\nwe begin to talk about instant response,\n\n47\n00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.950\nwe're talking about software\nthat is of a dark nature.\n\n48\n00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.795\nSoftware that comes from somewhere,\nnot controlled by us, most likely.\n\n49\n00:02:55.795 --> 00:02:58.920\nSomewhere unknown to us, but\nthat's looking to do us harm.\n\n50\n00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.360\nThere are viruses, there are worms, let's\ntalk about the difference between them.\n\n51\n00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.320\nVery subtle, but very important and\n\n52\n00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.740\ndistinct difference that we have to be\naware of, especially if you're planning on\n\n53\n00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.220\nanswering some questions at\nsome point in the future and\n\n54\n00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.040\nperhaps putting some letters after\nyour name as a result of doing that.\n\n55\n00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.860\nBut whether you're doing that or not,\njust as an in the field practitioner,\n\n56\n00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.880\nsomebody who as a security professional,\nas an IT professional,\n\n57\n00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.300\nas a network administrator, as anybody\ndoing anything in these fields today.\n\n58\n00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.110\nYou need to understand the different\nbetween these terms cuz you have to\n\n59\n00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.880\nunderstand how to address them.\n\n60\n00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.648\nViruses are gonna be executed or\nbrought into a system,\n\n61\n00:03:34.648 --> 00:03:38.500\ntypically through an attachment or\ndelivery through a program of some kind.\n\n62\n00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.930\nBut a user needs to interact\nwith them in some way.\n\n63\n00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.320\nHelping them to spread and replicate\nby executing or clicking on them or\n\n64\n00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.960\nopening an attachment that's been\ninfected or whatever the case may be.\n\n65\n00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.380\nBut viruses do not self-replicate.\n\n66\n00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.480\nViruses require help in order to spread.\n\n67\n00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.260\nThink about how you get\nsick in the real world.\n\n68\n00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.180\nIf you catch the flu, catch some sort\nof a bug, and you typically get it from\n\n69\n00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.530\nsomebody who's sick and gives it to\nyou through some sort of transmission\n\n70\n00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.580\nmechanism, and then you go on and spread\nthe good word to other people, right?\n\n71\n00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.970\nAnd that's how viruses are propagated\nin the computer world as well.\n\n72\n00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.810\nWorms, on the other hand,\nare self-replicating.\n\n73\n00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.514\nOnce we kick them off, spawn them, and\nsomehow generate them, we step away.\n\n74\n00:04:19.514 --> 00:04:24.034\nAnd unless there was some sort of\nbreak in the transmission chain due to\n\n75\n00:04:24.034 --> 00:04:26.650\na cutting of the network capabilities.\n\n76\n00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.330\nSo we isolate the machine.\n\n77\n00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.540\nNo longer allow the virus, or\nexcuse me, the worm to propagate.\n\n78\n00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.970\nThat worm will continue to go out and\n\n79\n00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.770\ninfect systems on its own without having\nto be spread by human interaction.\n\n80\n00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.442\nOne of the most successful\nworms of all time,\n\n81\n00:04:39.442 --> 00:04:42.010\nit's probably the most successful\npiece of malware of all time,\n\n82\n00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.050\nwhen we look at overall coverage based\non number of machines affected and\n\n83\n00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.942\nthose that were available at the time,\nwas the Robert Morris worm.\n\n84\n00:04:49.942 --> 00:04:54.235\nThis was the first example of malware of\na worm in the wild that was spread by\n\n85\n00:04:54.235 --> 00:04:58.265\naccident if you go back and\nunderstand the history of what happened.\n\n86\n00:04:58.265 --> 00:05:02.472\nBut ultimately, when you look at\nthe amount of machines that were effected\n\n87\n00:05:02.472 --> 00:05:04.875\non the networks connected at the time, and\n\n88\n00:05:04.875 --> 00:05:09.081\nthe coverage this worm was able to\nachieve, it almost took advantage of and\n\n89\n00:05:09.081 --> 00:05:13.423\nessentially connected to every machine\nthat was connected up to what we would\n\n90\n00:05:13.423 --> 00:05:17.492\nthink of now as the Internet, but\nyears ago was a very early form of that,\n\n91\n00:05:17.492 --> 00:05:21.710\nmuch less pervasive than it is today,\nmuch smaller than it is today.\n\n92\n00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.600\nBut achieved almost 100% coverage\nacross that network at the time.\n\n93\n00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.490\nThat is yet to be duplicated, thankfully.\n\n94\n00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.630\nIf you think about the potential liability\nassociated with a worm running wild today.\n\n95\n00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.570\nThose of you that are old\nenough that remember Slammer,\n\n96\n00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:42.531\nremember Code Red, Nimda, some of these\nworms that ran wild back in the last 15,\n\n97\n00:05:42.531 --> 00:05:46.790\n20 years or so, or in the last 10 years,\nor whatever the case may have been.\n\n98\n00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.580\nBut if you remember being in this\nindustry and working, if you\n\n99\n00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.868\nare old enough to have actually been doing\nthis at the time these worms were around,\n\n100\n00:05:53.868 --> 00:05:57.800\nand you lived through them firsthand\nyou know how destructive and\n\n101\n00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.980\nhow potentially problematic worms can be.\n\n102\n00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:03.370\nAlso, more importantly,\nhow incredibly difficult they are to stop.\n\n103\n00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.328\nIf you remember Slammer in particular and\nCode Red.\n\n104\n00:06:06.328 --> 00:06:08.343\nThe minute you brought a machine up,\n\n105\n00:06:08.343 --> 00:06:12.760\nconnecting it to not only to your network,\nbut just to the outside world.\n\n106\n00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.400\nEven through gateways,\nfirewalls, filters, etcetera.\n\n107\n00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.520\nWithin about 30 seconds, if that machine\nhad a vulnerability on it that would allow\n\n108\n00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.660\nthe worm to propagate, that machine\nwas probably attacked and infected and\n\n109\n00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.010\nwas then essentially re-exporting that\nworm out to all machines on the inside\n\n110\n00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.080\nof the firewall that could be affected.\n\n111\n00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.360\nAnd this thing spread so quickly that\nit was almost impossible to bring\n\n112\n00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.480\nsystems up without them being infected.\n\n113\n00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.370\nSo it can be very, very problematic when\nworms run amok, thankfully we don't see\n\n114\n00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:44.150\nthem very often these days, but\nwhen we do, you know, they are very, very\n\n115\n00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.635\ndifficult for us as incident responders\nand incident handlers to address.\n\n116\n00:06:47.635 --> 00:06:50.440\nTrojans, another category of\nmalware that we like to talk about.\n\n117\n00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.959\nPrograms masquerading inside of other\nprograms that are up to no good.\n\n118\n00:06:55.959 --> 00:07:00.160\nSo you think about a program that's\na nice shiny, happy program, right?\n\n119\n00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.296\nWallpaper, hey, let me download that\nparticular program, let me run that.\n\n120\n00:07:04.296 --> 00:07:06.868\nAnd inside,\nyou get the wallpaper program, but\n\n121\n00:07:06.868 --> 00:07:09.815\nyou get something that's\na surprise as well, as Dan and\n\n122\n00:07:09.815 --> 00:07:13.980\nI were chatting before we came on for\nthis particular episode, right?\n\n123\n00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.530\nAnd so\nif somebody sends you an attachment,\n\n124\n00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:20.110\nyou download a piece of software,\nhowever you get there, that seemingly on\n\n125\n00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.035\nthe surface looks totally innocuous, how\ndo you really know what's inside of it?\n\n126\n00:07:24.035 --> 00:07:28.530\nUnless you broke that software open,\nexamined it by taking it apart, and were\n\n127\n00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:32.000\nable to understand what you were looking\nat from a code perspective, you may have\n\n128\n00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.920\nno way of knowing what that program\nactually does or may have involved in it.\n\n129\n00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.710\nAnd this is the danger of malware,\nthis is the danger of Trojans.\n\n130\n00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:44.468\nWe don't know what's wrapped up inside,\nand it's the internal secondary program\n\n131\n00:07:44.468 --> 00:07:48.569\nthat is hidden from view that gets\nexecuted that really does the damage.\n\n132\n00:07:48.569 --> 00:07:51.585\nSo you may be getting a lot more than\nyou bargained for, right, when you go to\n\n133\n00:07:51.585 --> 00:07:54.578\ndownload something from a website that\nyou may or may not be familiar with.\n\n134\n00:07:54.578 --> 00:07:58.937\nAnd, you know, no matter how much training\nwe do, No matter how much education we do,\n\n135\n00:07:58.937 --> 00:08:03.239\nawareness we do, telling people hey, don't\ngo to these places things are too good to\n\n136\n00:08:03.239 --> 00:08:06.168\nbe true, somebody offers you\nMicrosoft Office for free,\n\n137\n00:08:06.168 --> 00:08:10.020\nit's probably not Office and\nit's definitely not gonna be free.\n\n138\n00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:12.340\nYou may not pay for it, but\nyou will pay for it later.\n\n139\n00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.880\nYou just may not pay for\nit upfront with money, right?\n\n140\n00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.060\nThese are things that people\nunfortunately don't really listen to.\n\n141\n00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.510\nThese are lessons that you\nhave to learn the hard way.\n\n142\n00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:25.760\nI remember being a kid and I remember in\nmy grandmother's house, there was a lamp,\n\n143\n00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:26.380\none of those, hey,\n\n144\n00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:30.210\ndon't touch it deals, like special\nsuper duper lamp, don't touch it.\n\n145\n00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.240\nI remember touching it and\nnothing happens.\n\n146\n00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.810\nSo I'm like all right, well, whatever.\n\n147\n00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:35.470\nSo I'll just play with whatever I want.\n\n148\n00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:37.440\nWell, it wasn't don't touch\nit cuz you would break it,\n\n149\n00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.730\nit was don't touch it because\nit wasn't wired properly.\n\n150\n00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:41.100\nIt wasn't grounded and\n\n151\n00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.690\nif you touched it when it was on,\nyou would light up like a Christmas tree.\n\n152\n00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:48.290\nAnd so I remember, you know,\nthinking I knew better.\n\n153\n00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:52.390\nAnd of course I went to touch it when\nit happened to have been plugged in and\n\n154\n00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:55.325\nmy eyes spun around my sockets, right?\n\n155\n00:08:55.325 --> 00:08:55.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because, you know,\n\n156\n00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:56.814\nI got zapped [CROSSTALK]\neverything wasn't grounded.\n\n157\n00:08:56.814 --> 00:08:57.758\n&gt;&gt; A wake up call that day?\n\n158\n00:08:57.758 --> 00:09:01.495\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that was quite a wake up call I\nremember to this day what that felt like,\n\n159\n00:09:01.495 --> 00:09:04.830\nand so the reality is there are some\nlessons that you just have to learn\n\n160\n00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:08.624\nthe hard way, no matter how much we tell\nyou to the contrary, there are certain\n\n161\n00:09:08.624 --> 00:09:12.930\nthings you're just gonna have to be\nstupid about and figure out for yourself.\n\n162\n00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.670\nDon't let this be one of them,\nis what I'm suggesting to you, right?\n\n163\n00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:16.720\nAnd I know it's not you.\n\n164\n00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.550\nI know it's not the people that\nare listening to me and are listening to\n\n165\n00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:23.780\nus right now that we have to worry about,\nbecause I know you get it, right.\n\n166\n00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:26.800\nThe whole reason you're here,\nwhole reason you do what you do,\n\n167\n00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.200\nis because you understand\nthe importance of this.\n\n168\n00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.850\nIt's the people that you have to reach,\nin your networks, in your organization.\n\n169\n00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:33.400\nThe people, two,\n\n170\n00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.930\nthree levels down stream from us,\nthat are the people that may not get it.\n\n171\n00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:41.050\nAnd the people that we have to figure\nhow to create awareness around and\n\n172\n00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:44.470\nin their minds create a sense\nof urgency around the fact that\n\n173\n00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:46.700\nthese things can be problematic, right?\n\n174\n00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.980\nThey can hurt us and\nit may not be easy to come back from that.\n\n175\n00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.940\nAnd they can cause catastrophic damage and\nloss and so\n\n176\n00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.210\nwe have to find ways to raise awareness.\n\n177\n00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:59.390\nMaking examples available to people,\nshowing them the impact of this,\n\n178\n00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.760\nis one way to do it, but\nthere are lots of ways, right?\n\n179\n00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.740\nSo for instance, speaking of lots of ways,\nif we could take a field trip,\n\n180\n00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.550\neverybody have their permission slips?\n\n181\n00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:08.680\nLet me see them, hold them up,\nlet's see them signed.\n\n182\n00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.430\nWe need partners, join hands, right?\n\n183\n00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:13.160\nAnd make sure you pick your seats on\nthe bus, it's gonna be a long trip.\n\n184\n00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.430\nLet's take a look real quick\nright over here, if we could.\n\n185\n00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:19.110\nRight over here if we could,\nthird times the charm.\n\n186\n00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:20.759\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n&gt;&gt; Right over here if we could,\n\n187\n00:10:20.759 --> 00:10:21.670\nright over there.\n\n188\n00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:23.700\n&gt;&gt; To the right, always to the right.\n\n189\n00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.446\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI don't know my right from my left.\n\n190\n00:10:25.446 --> 00:10:26.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Your other right.\n\n191\n00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.470\n&gt;&gt; Anyway right over there on\nthe screen in front of us.\n\n192\n00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:30.920\nLet's take a look and\nwhat I just wanted to show you.\n\n193\n00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.950\nThis is nothing in particularly special,\nthis is nothing outrageous,\n\n194\n00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:35.050\nnot a special tool.\n\n195\n00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:38.930\nThis is just hey let me just go out on\nthe internet and ask an obvious question.\n\n196\n00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:42.370\nBut what an important question we can\nask and what resources we can find.\n\n197\n00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:47.300\nYou see Google is up,\nyou'll see malware information database,\n\n198\n00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:52.090\nright, or at least the attempt\nto spell database right, and\n\n199\n00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:55.717\nyou can see three simple words,\nI googled it, what did I get back?\n\n200\n00:10:55.717 --> 00:10:59.930\nI got 47.2 million hits\nin less than one second.\n\n201\n00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:00.850\nAnd as we've all agreed,\n\n202\n00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:04.230\nthere's about 47.2 million references that\nare probably not valuable right there.\n\n203\n00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But the first five or\n\n204\n00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:07.500\nsix certainly are.\n\n205\n00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.050\nBut when you see what we get here,\nwhat are some of the things we find?\n\n206\n00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:11.870\nWell let's just take a look\nreal quick shall we?\n\n207\n00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:15.710\nI've got the Recent Malware McAfee\nLabs Threat Center from Intel,\n\n208\n00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:17.590\nwe're gonna take a look\nat that in just a minute.\n\n209\n00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:21.650\nThe MIST, the Malware Information Sharing\nPlatform and Threat Sharing Project,\n\n210\n00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:23.290\nis also a really good one.\n\n211\n00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:26.790\nYou've got ESG Threats,\nto name a software threat database.\n\n212\n00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:27.600\nThere's a whole bunch of them.\n\n213\n00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.860\nSymantec is there.\n\n214\n00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.832\nAll the major AV vendors,\nright, just pop right up.\n\n215\n00:11:31.832 --> 00:11:33.104\nI don't have to know who they are.\nI don't have to know what they are.\n\n216\n00:11:33.104 --> 00:11:34.803\nI just have to know that I should go ask.\n\n217\n00:11:34.803 --> 00:11:41.146\nAnd I pulled up just the first one,\nto take a look at real quick.\n\n218\n00:11:41.146 --> 00:11:44.360\nLet me just bring this up so\nyou can see this.\n\n219\n00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.610\nView recent malware right here.\n\n220\n00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.780\nYou'll see Intel Security, McAfee.\n\n221\n00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:53.820\nAnd you'll see that we can search\nthe threat library direct detect.\n\n222\n00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:56.520\nDetection names of recent malware,\n\n223\n00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.770\nI do have to learn how to actually\nspeak coherently when I do this.\n\n224\n00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:03.150\nAnd you'll see we have\na listing based on type here,\n\n225\n00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:07.880\nsome malware, type malware, trojans,\nhoaxes, vulnerabilities, etc.\n\n226\n00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.290\nWe have sub-type, is it a backdoor?\n\n227\n00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:11.458\nAn exploited trojan, whatever.\n\n228\n00:12:11.458 --> 00:12:17.820\nWe have a day and a reference to the year\nand month, where this was found.\n\n229\n00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.240\nWe have a risk rating here.\n\n230\n00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:25.430\nAnd so you'll see things like Android\nfake app, what do we have here?\n\n231\n00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:30.390\nJS trojan, Android mortar,\nwe have all these different items,\n\n232\n00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:31.680\nyou click on any one of them.\n\n233\n00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.480\nDoesn't really matter what it is.\n\n234\n00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.850\nAnd it brings us out,\ngives us a little risk assessment,\n\n235\n00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:40.080\ngives us the ability to\ndownload current updates and\n\n236\n00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:44.020\ngives us an overview of where it is,\nhow prevalent it is in the world.\n\n237\n00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.430\nIf we have something that's running amok,\n\n238\n00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:47.430\nwe would obviously see\nreal time intelligence.\n\n239\n00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:52.400\nYou hover, you see there's zero\ninformation on these countries,\n\n240\n00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.849\nmaybe there's no outbreak right now,\nbut you get a sense of that obviously.\n\n241\n00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:59.220\nWe could also see characteristics.\n\n242\n00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:00.890\nWe could see symptomology.\n\n243\n00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:03.650\nMethod of infection, very important\nthat we obviously know that.\n\n244\n00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:05.280\nRemoval, important to know that.\n\n245\n00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.670\nAny and all of the AV vendors will have\nthis kind of information out there\n\n246\n00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:10.410\nabout These kinda of items.\n\n247\n00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:13.370\nIt's just up to us as incident\nresponders to understand that and\n\n248\n00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:14.680\ntake advantage of that.\n\n249\n00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.790\nI usually, when I do work for\ncustomers and\n\n250\n00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:22.160\nif I'm doing this kind of a hey, let's\ncreate security awareness campaign thing.\n\n251\n00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.980\nI will usually pick on of these a month,\nprofile it and\n\n252\n00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:31.140\nsend it in like a little email and\na link out to, as a general email blast or\n\n253\n00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:36.050\na news blast to the organization and\nsay, hey, have you seen this?\n\n254\n00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:36.730\nOr are you aware of this?\n\n255\n00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:39.620\nYou may not be infected by this,\nbut what would happen if you were?\n\n256\n00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:40.710\nHow would you know?\n\n257\n00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:43.660\nIt is getting people to think\nabout those kinda things,\n\n258\n00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:46.280\nhelps to spread the knowledge and\nspread the awareness.\n\n259\n00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.670\nWe come back to this idea time and again\nof see something, say something, right?\n\n260\n00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:53.930\nIf we can enable 1000 information\nworkers in our organization,\n\n261\n00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:58.570\nto become eyes and ears for the incident\nresponse function of the organization.\n\n262\n00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:03.160\nHow much more powerful are we than if we\nrely on a dedicated team of five, six, or\n\n263\n00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:07.480\nseven individuals that can't be in all\nplaces at all times, and can't possibly\n\n264\n00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:11.480\nhave knowledge of everything that's going\non within those systems in real time.\n\n265\n00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.040\nJust think about the logic of that, right?\n\n266\n00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:17.340\nWe're essentially flying blind one way and\nwe've got eyes everywhere the other way.\n\n267\n00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:18.462\nWhich one would you rather have?\n\n268\n00:14:18.462 --> 00:14:23.360\nI'd rather have 1,000 people helping\nme to become more responsive and\n\n269\n00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.870\nmore focused on protecting them than\ntrying to do it with six or seven people.\n\n270\n00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:29.610\nThat's just the law of numbers\nit tells you obviously you're\n\n271\n00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:32.820\ngonna be a lot more\nsuccessful at finding things.\n\n272\n00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:36.400\nEven if 999 of those people don't ever\nhave anything that they contribute,\n\n273\n00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.680\nbecause they don't see anything,\n\n274\n00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.820\njust because they're not\naware of something going on.\n\n275\n00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.960\nAll it takes is one person to report one\nitem, that may be the difference between\n\n276\n00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:47.440\na catastrophic system attack being stopped\nand it being allowed to happen, and\n\n277\n00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.410\nhaving to be re-mediated after the fact.\n\n278\n00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:51.110\nSo I want people paying attention.\n\n279\n00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:53.580\nI want people to understand and\nto know about that, right.\n\n280\n00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:55.310\nThat's really the though process here.\n\n281\n00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:59.010\nSo Wanted to just show you that and\ngive you a sense of that.\n\n282\n00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:00.920\nWe can go through that list and\nlook at any of those and\n\n283\n00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.090\nyou're seeing very similar concepts there.\n\n284\n00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:07.250\nBut this is the idea of how we look\nat spyware, malware of any kind,\n\n285\n00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:08.660\ntrojans, viruses, worms.\n\n286\n00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:09.550\nHow we deal with it.\n\n287\n00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:12.820\nWhat are some of the preparation steps we\nmade have to deal with or think about for\n\n288\n00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:13.500\ngirth to handling.\n\n289\n00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.750\nI mentioned things like create awareness.\n\n290\n00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:18.100\nBut, you know, keeping AV viruses, or\n\n291\n00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:22.950\nrather AV definitions up to date in your\nAV and malware engine is very important.\n\n292\n00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:23.500\nRight?\n\n293\n00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.590\nSo we set the stuff to auto download and\nto auto update.\n\n294\n00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:29.840\nSo we may try to automate a lot of that so\nwe're not relying on individuals.\n\n295\n00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.930\nTo opt in and click and\ndo updates on their own.\n\n296\n00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:33.410\nThat's one way to think about this.\n\n297\n00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:37.130\nRunning daily scans on systems,\naggregating that information,\n\n298\n00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:40.430\nmaking sure we know if there's\nan outbreak or a hot spot somewhere.\n\n299\n00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:44.541\nLooking at trending with systems like this\nto understand if there are outbreaks of\n\n300\n00:15:44.541 --> 00:15:47.997\nmalware that we should be aware of,\nwhere they're coming from, and\n\n301\n00:15:47.997 --> 00:15:49.145\nhow they attack here.\n\n302\n00:15:49.145 --> 00:15:53.383\nWhat's the method of infection, as you can\nsee right there, what's the attack vector\n\n303\n00:15:53.383 --> 00:15:57.450\nare we sustainable because we have systems\nthat are running in that configuration or\n\n304\n00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:00.278\nwe run that particular of system\nwhatever the case may be?\n\n305\n00:16:00.278 --> 00:16:05.250\nI talk to people all the time\nabout malware on mobile platforms.\n\n306\n00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:09.250\nBecause a lot of people don't think about\nthe fact that they're running an iPhone or\n\n307\n00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:10.370\nthey're running an Android phone.\n\n308\n00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:14.335\nAnd they say, there's no malware,\nwe don't get malware on Apple.\n\n309\n00:16:14.335 --> 00:16:18.926\nWell, what was it, like the old,\nnot Wheel of Fortune,\n\n310\n00:16:18.926 --> 00:16:22.020\nthe one with I just blew this totally.\n\n311\n00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This was all supposed to be\n\n312\n00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.270\nspontaneous, and\nI just totally screwed it up.\n\n313\n00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:26.090\nFamily Feud, right?\n\n314\n00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:26.600\n&gt;&gt; Survey says?\n\n315\n00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.230\n&gt;&gt; I was thinking Newkirk from\nHogan's Heroes, I couldn't remember.\n\n316\n00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:32.080\nFamily Feud, right,\nsurvey says, the big X, right?\n\n317\n00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.530\nWrong, right, because the reality is,\n\n318\n00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:38.890\nthat there is ample evidence that we\nhave malware on Android platforms.\n\n319\n00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:43.820\nThere's ample evidence that we have\nAndroid as well as Apple I keep wanting\n\n320\n00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:47.150\nto say Apple Android, Apple malware right.\n\n321\n00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.360\nWe know all you have to do is go out and\nGoogle it.\n\n322\n00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.970\nThere are hundreds of examples of\nthis taking place on these platforms.\n\n323\n00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:56.690\nNo where near the amount that is\noccurring in Windows don't get me wrong\n\n324\n00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:57.660\nfar and away.\n\n325\n00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:01.430\nNumber one platform attack has been\nWindows historically year in and year out.\n\n326\n00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:05.080\nBut recently as of the end of\nlast year the end of 2016.\n\n327\n00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:09.280\nAndroid overtook Microsoft as the number\ndeployed operating system on the planet.\n\n328\n00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.450\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n329\n00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:14.630\n&gt;&gt; Not because they own corporate desktops\nbecause of the use of that platform and\n\n330\n00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:17.180\nall of the mobile devices that we have.\n\n331\n00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:22.110\nPhones, tablets, laptops, probably not\nlaptops, but certainly phones and tablets.\n\n332\n00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:22.610\nRight?\n\n333\n00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:26.980\nSo if you think about the fact that the\nnumber one deployed operating system today\n\n334\n00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:29.330\nis an Android based operating system.\n\n335\n00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:33.604\nEven though the bulk of those systems are\nnot corporate owned and corporate managed,\n\n336\n00:17:33.604 --> 00:17:35.755\nthat's an even scarier thought process.\n\n337\n00:17:35.755 --> 00:17:40.050\nBecause they're not under central MDM,\nMobile Device Management Systems.\n\n338\n00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:43.200\nFor the most part, they're being\nindividually managed by users\n\n339\n00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.349\nwho probably don't pay a lot\nof attention to security.\n\n340\n00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:51.200\nThat is a coming tsunami of problems that\nwe are going to have to face in the next\n\n341\n00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.900\nseveral years and\nyou heard it here first by the way.\n\n342\n00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:57.740\nWhen it does happen replay this as\nthe zombie apocalypse is about to\n\n343\n00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:00.730\nland at your doorstep and\nfondly remember a time.\n\n344\n00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:03.600\nWhen it was still safe to\nsurf the web using a phone.\n\n345\n00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.260\nBecause I promise you, and\nI'm not trying to be overly dramatic.\n\n346\n00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:11.880\nBut I promise you we are gonna see\nample evidence of amplification attacks\n\n347\n00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.950\nagainst Android platforms because of the\nfact they're not being centrally managed.\n\n348\n00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:20.135\nThis is a huge, huge ticking time bomb for\nus as incident responders and\n\n349\n00:18:20.135 --> 00:18:21.268\ncenter handlers.\n\n350\n00:18:21.268 --> 00:18:22.660\nPeople are not talking about this.\n\n351\n00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.750\nThey're just assuming it's gonna be okay.\n\n352\n00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:27.150\nNobody's gonna think to go out and\nattack Android.\n\n353\n00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:28.650\nWhy would they?\n\n354\n00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:30.470\nWell, I could think of lots of reasons,\nright-\n\n355\n00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:31.480\n&gt;&gt; Cuz everybody's got one now [LAUGH]\n\n356\n00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.100\n&gt;&gt; Cuz everybody in the world has one, and\n\n357\n00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:36.250\nwhere do most people store\na lot of sensitive PII?\n\n358\n00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:38.160\nPersonally identifiable information-\n&gt;&gt; And how-\n\n359\n00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.470\n&gt;&gt; Credit card information,\n\n360\n00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:40.470\nall that kinda stuff.\n\n361\n00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:43.450\nin their mobile phones,\nas stupid as that sounds.\n\n362\n00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:46.560\n&gt;&gt; How secure is your average\nend user on their own,\n\n363\n00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.240\nif you left them to their own devices?\n\n364\n00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.940\nWhich, if it is their own device,\n&gt;&gt; You literally are leaving them\n\n365\n00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:51.490\nto their own device.\n\n366\n00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:53.600\n&gt;&gt; You're literally leaving\nthem to their own devices,\n\n367\n00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:57.630\nthey're gonna be, it's just rife\n&gt;&gt; With a, and\n\n368\n00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:59.940\nripe for the picking so they say.\n\n369\n00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.730\n&gt;&gt; Ripe with opportunity and\nrife with vulnerability right.\n\n370\n00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:04.930\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; I mean this is just, this is a really,\n\n371\n00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:09.320\nreally problematic situation\nwe find ourselves looking at,\n\n372\n00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:10.420\nunfolding slowly but surely.\n\n373\n00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:12.370\nIt's almost like watching\na train wreck in slow motion.\n\n374\n00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:13.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It, it's so\n\n375\n00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:15.420\ncompelling you can't\ntake your eyes off it,\n\n376\n00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:18.710\nyet at the same time you know how horrible\nit's gonna be when it finishes right.\n\n377\n00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:20.240\nSo, you know, it's just one example.\n\n378\n00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:21.360\nThere are many of these.\n\n379\n00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.460\nAnd I'm not suggesting that that means\nthat you shouldn't use these devices.\n\n380\n00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:27.280\nI'm not suggesting for a minute, doesn't\nmean that you can't use them securely.\n\n381\n00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:31.800\nWhat I'm simply pointing out to you is\nthat you have to understand that just\n\n382\n00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:36.010\nbecause we, as professionals, know how to\ndo this, the average person, to Daniel's\n\n383\n00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:40.570\npoint, is probably not going to be able to\nunderstand how to do this successfully.\n\n384\n00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:44.460\nAnd that is the person that we have to\nworry about because that's the majority\n\n385\n00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.220\nof the usage that's taking place.\n\n386\n00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:49.930\nAnd what's even scarier is that these\ndevices are being connected back to\n\n387\n00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:53.360\ncorporate assets, which may or\nmay not be managed properly.\n\n388\n00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:56.720\nAnd if they're not put under mobile\ndevice management in some form but\n\n389\n00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:00.250\nallowed to connect in\nwithout policy based and\n\n390\n00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:04.010\ncontrol based Management\nbeing put into this device.\n\n391\n00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:07.630\nYou're essentially letting a cannon\nloose inside the system with no control.\n\n392\n00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:09.740\nAnd it's just going to randomly start,\nyou know,\n\n393\n00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:12.360\ngoing off wherever it feels\nthat it's most appropriate.\n\n394\n00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:15.420\nYou know people look at me in\nshock when I say there's malware\n\n395\n00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:16.530\nin the Google Play Store.\n\n396\n00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:18.910\nThere's malware in the iStore,\nthe iTunes store.\n\n397\n00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:20.920\nNo there's not, those vendors are secure.\n\n398\n00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.430\nWell of course they're secure, but\n\n399\n00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:27.660\nthere's ample defined, and quantifiable\nevidence of the fact that there have been\n\n400\n00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:31.430\napps that have made it past every security\nscreening mechanism put in place.\n\n401\n00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:34.490\nHave been made available for\ndownload, have been downloaded\n\n402\n00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:38.800\nonly to find out after the fact,\nthat they indeed were illegitimate.\n\n403\n00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.280\nThey were spreading malware.\n\n404\n00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.440\nGoogle's been hit.\n\n405\n00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.620\nMicrosoft and their store has been hit.\n\n406\n00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:44.640\nApple has been hit.\n\n407\n00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:48.420\nEvery vendor, every major vendor,\nhas been hit, multiple times, by the way.\n\n408\n00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.410\nNot just once or twice, right?\n\n409\n00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:53.800\nIt's just ou don't often hear about\nthis because people just don't,\n\n410\n00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:58.300\nfor a variety of reasons tend to\npublicize this, but it is going on.\n\n411\n00:20:58.300 --> 00:20:59.780\nYou have to be aware of it.\n\n412\n00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:01.940\nIt's stuff like this we\nhave to think about.\n\n413\n00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:06.520\nSo, establishing policies to deal with\nmalware and the use of mobile devices and\n\n414\n00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.590\nhow we deal with all that from\na management prospective.\n\n415\n00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:10.490\nVery important.\n\n416\n00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:12.838\nInstalling AV software and\nanti-malware software,\n\n417\n00:21:12.838 --> 00:21:15.490\nkeeping up-to-date on all endpoints,\nvery important.\n\n418\n00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:17.740\nChecking and\nscanning all downloaded files and\n\n419\n00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:21.500\nattachments through filters to make sure,\nto the best of our ability,\n\n420\n00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:25.280\nthat we're not downloading known\nbad things would be important.\n\n421\n00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.620\nProblem is stuff that's encrypted\nmay not be able to be scanned,\n\n422\n00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:29.440\nso we may have issues with some of that.\n\n423\n00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:30.120\nGotta be aware of that.\n\n424\n00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.950\nHow about checking all removable media for\ninfection?\n\n425\n00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:36.470\nWhen was the last time you plugged\none of these little devices in right.\n\n426\n00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:38.620\nI don't know if you can see that,\nit's probably hard to see.\n\n427\n00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:40.510\nBut I'm holding up a thumb drive.\n\n428\n00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:42.670\nI don't know if you could zoom by\nthe way while I'm holding this.\n\n429\n00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:43.970\nYou may be able to, I'm not sure.\n\n430\n00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:47.140\nCan you zoom in while I'm talking\nreal quick and just, can we see that.\n\n431\n00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.425\nWell okay that was one way I suppose.\n\n432\n00:21:49.425 --> 00:21:50.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Wasn't quite what I had in mind\n\n433\n00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:51.420\nbut it works.\n\n434\n00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:54.330\nBut you can see that it's so small.\n\n435\n00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:57.350\nThe reason I wanted you to zoom\nin is that you can see how\n\n436\n00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:59.110\ntiny this thing is when I turn it over.\n\n437\n00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:01.880\nI mean this is probably,\nlet me hold it up and\n\n438\n00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:05.840\nyou can see, it's roughly the length,\nwait let me get it over here.\n\n439\n00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:11.220\nI can't do this all at once, but\nyou can see there it's roughly that long.\n\n440\n00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:12.990\nRight that part of my finger\nits basically that amount.\n\n441\n00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:16.110\nI mean we talking on entry mark its\nnot that okay that's a little crazy\n\n442\n00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:18.180\nyou like do one of these and step back and\n\n443\n00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:21.230\nI can there we are because you\nright up against my nose right.\n\n444\n00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:23.720\nSo its so small that its so\n\n445\n00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:27.890\neasy to bring that into an organization\nwith nobody realizing what it is right.\n\n446\n00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:30.500\nI mean correct me if I'm wrong you told\nme when I borrowed this from you right\n\n447\n00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:33.490\nyou just came in and found it sitting on\nthe desk and decided to use it right.\n\n448\n00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:34.330\n&gt;&gt; That's correct.\n&gt;&gt; Didn't necessarily\n\n449\n00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:35.450\nknow where it came from.\n\n450\n00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:38.010\nNo.\n&gt;&gt; Boy that was a yeah, you should be.\n\n451\n00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:39.320\n&gt;&gt; No, I know where it came from.\n\n452\n00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:39.960\nIt came from Dom.\n\n453\n00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.030\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But somebody left it for you,\n\n454\n00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:44.440\nyou picked it up, started using it,\nwhich was fine but think about it.\n\n455\n00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:49.405\nWe have a specific attack, we execute\nwhen we do pen testing that goes along\n\n456\n00:22:49.405 --> 00:22:52.795\nthe lines of what Dan described and\nhe obviously, knew where it came from.\n\n457\n00:22:52.795 --> 00:22:55.545\nI was being a little exaggerated\nwhen I talked about this,\n\n458\n00:22:55.545 --> 00:22:57.575\nbut we do what's called\na parking lot attack.\n\n459\n00:22:57.575 --> 00:23:00.565\nWe scatter devices like this\nliterally in the parking lot,\n\n460\n00:23:00.565 --> 00:23:03.095\nwhen we get out to do pen tests and\nwe see who picks them up,\n\n461\n00:23:03.095 --> 00:23:06.155\nbrings them into the building,\nplugs them in without checking them first.\n\n462\n00:23:06.155 --> 00:23:08.690\nYou know what kind of stuff we\ncan put on a device like this?\n\n463\n00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:11.050\nLooks real small,\nyou know how much stuff this holds?\n\n464\n00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:13.840\nAll we need is one little text\nfile it's about a kilobyte in size\n\n465\n00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.350\nto take over an entire\nnetwork from the inside out.\n\n466\n00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:19.780\nNot hard to do when you're\nable to transport data\n\n467\n00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:21.410\nin that kind of a compact format.\n\n468\n00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:24.640\nAnd let's not forget about\nthe fact that this looks obvious,\n\n469\n00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.900\nthis looks like a USB thumb drive.\n\n470\n00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.990\nWhat about the USB drives that don't\nlook anything like USB drives right?\n\n471\n00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:33.320\nThey look like a variety of other things,\nI've seen them looking like earrings.\n\n472\n00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.980\nI've seen them looking like jewelry, I've\nseen them looking like bluetooth headsets,\n\n473\n00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:40.270\nall sorts of, the tops of a pen, you\npull it out, it's got the little thing.\n\n474\n00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:41.990\nWe've all seen this kind of stuff, right?\n\n475\n00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:46.010\nAnd would it be hard to bring something\nlike that in somewhere, plug it in?\n\n476\n00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:49.985\nWhat about media players,\nwhat about dare I say Zunes?\n\n477\n00:23:49.985 --> 00:23:51.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm a big advocate of the Zune,\n\n478\n00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:52.740\nI still have one, I use it all the time.\n\n479\n00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:54.960\nI think I'm the only person on\nthe planet to want to admit to that.\n\n480\n00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:55.726\n&gt;&gt; Everybody's out there going, what?\n\n481\n00:23:55.726 --> 00:23:57.495\n&gt;&gt; What the hell is that?\n\n482\n00:23:57.495 --> 00:24:00.103\n&gt;&gt; Microsoft made a media player?\n\n483\n00:24:00.103 --> 00:24:01.122\nBut Zune, forget about a Zune.\n\n484\n00:24:01.122 --> 00:24:02.288\nSo you can't use that anywhere.\n\n485\n00:24:02.288 --> 00:24:05.384\nBut, you know, what about some\nsort of an iPod or iDevice, or\n\n486\n00:24:05.384 --> 00:24:08.400\nthe equivalent whatever it is,\nor the cheap knock-offs.\n\n487\n00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.960\nCan you bring one of those things in,\nplug it in to tether it, sync it up?\n\n488\n00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:12.870\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n489\n00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:13.940\nPeople do it all the time.\n\n490\n00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:15.750\nYou know that's essentially\njust a hard drive.\n\n491\n00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:19.930\nCould you put files on there aside from\nmusic, store them there, and execute them?\n\n492\n00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:21.350\nAbsolutely.\n\n493\n00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:24.431\nWhen I do pen tests, guess what guys,\nhow do you think we bring this kind of\n\n494\n00:24:24.431 --> 00:24:26.980\nstuff into your organizations\nwithout being seen, right?\n\n495\n00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:28.740\nBecause nobody takes a look at that and\n\n496\n00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:32.260\nsays twice there must be something\nbad in there, don't bring that in.\n\n497\n00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:34.773\nThe only people smart enough to\ndo that are the government and\n\n498\n00:24:34.773 --> 00:24:36.158\nmilitary offices that I work in.\n\n499\n00:24:36.158 --> 00:24:39.326\nWhere they won't allow you to bring\nthis stuff in, cuz they know better.\n\n500\n00:24:39.326 --> 00:24:42.800\nBut in average corporate environments\npeople don't challenge that stuff.\n\n501\n00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.145\nYou could walk in with a bazooka.\n\n502\n00:24:44.145 --> 00:24:46.160\nNobody would give you a second look,\nright?\n\n503\n00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:49.974\nSo the reality is that there's so\nmany ways that this stuff infiltrates\n\n504\n00:24:49.974 --> 00:24:53.920\ninto networks today,\nwe've got to be on guard all the time.\n\n505\n00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:57.250\nOne of the biggest things you can do as\nincident responders to prevent this kinda\n\n506\n00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:01.230\nstuff, create an ant-tethering,\nanti-use policy around these devices.\n\n507\n00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:05.372\nI love when I go on site and\ndo auto work and I walk through, you know,\n\n508\n00:25:05.372 --> 00:25:09.690\nin the general cube farm and\nI see just row after row, acre after acre.\n\n509\n00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:12.319\nIt's almost like watching The Matrix\nwhere they pan back through the shot and\n\n510\n00:25:12.319 --> 00:25:13.970\nyou see all the human batteries, right?\n\n511\n00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:18.480\nI see all of this opportunity as\na bad actor because I see everybody\n\n512\n00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:22.550\nwith their phones, and their device is\nplugged in and being charged and tethered.\n\n513\n00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:23.487\nEven a cellphone or\n\n514\n00:25:23.487 --> 00:25:27.070\nsmartphone today has either onboard\nand/or external memory storage.\n\n515\n00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:28.820\nYou know what kinda stuff\nyou could put in there?\n\n516\n00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:30.240\nWe've already talked about this right?\n\n517\n00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:35.370\nYou tether that device to a corporate\nowned asset and you hook it up wirelessly.\n\n518\n00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:38.530\nNow we've successfully bridged\nthe outside and the inside right?\n\n519\n00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:40.570\nTogether.\nAnd you've opened up a pathway for\n\n520\n00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:41.800\na hacker.\n\n521\n00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:45.536\nPerhaps, depending on how you set that up,\nto potentially get right into the machine.\n\n522\n00:25:45.536 --> 00:25:48.790\nNow, many corporations,\nto be fair, scan those systems.\n\n523\n00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:50.212\nThey block those ports.\n\n524\n00:25:50.212 --> 00:25:52.550\nThey don't allow those\ndevices to be initialized.\n\n525\n00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:54.410\nThey may allow them to power up to charge.\n\n526\n00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:56.695\nThey won't allow them to be\nmounted as a storage device.\n\n527\n00:25:56.695 --> 00:25:58.370\nBut, what about the ones that don't?\n\n528\n00:25:58.370 --> 00:25:59.940\nAll it takes is one, by the way, right?\n\n529\n00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:02.540\nGot to think about this kind of stuff.\n\n530\n00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:04.310\nThis is where incident handling,\n\n531\n00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:08.330\nincident response with regards to malware\nbecomes a big deal for us, right?\n\n532\n00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:12.210\nWe have to think about the fact that\nto identify infected hosts, you know,\n\n533\n00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:15.770\nwe can do this front line and center,\nfirst hand, by sitting down and\n\n534\n00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:16.600\nmanually looking at it.\n\n535\n00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:17.780\nWe've been talking about that.\n\n536\n00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:20.100\nWe can use active identification\nthrough scanning.\n\n537\n00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:21.450\nWe've talked about that as well.\n\n538\n00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:23.721\nWe could forensically examine\na host after the fact.\n\n539\n00:26:23.721 --> 00:26:24.973\nAnd unwind what's happened.\n\n540\n00:26:24.973 --> 00:26:27.820\nWe talked about this and\nthe issues and concerns here.\n\n541\n00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.690\nThere's lots of ways to do this.\n\n542\n00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:33.180\nBut we have to understand\nthat the best of all worlds\n\n543\n00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:36.970\nis to prevent it before it is allowed\nto touch the system in the first place.\n\n544\n00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:40.780\nIf I have to remediate the system after\nthe fact, if I have to forensically\n\n545\n00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:44.417\nexamine the system and undo the damage,\nI've already lost, right?\n\n546\n00:26:44.417 --> 00:26:46.940\nAll I'm doing is cleaning up\nsomebody else's mess at that point.\n\n547\n00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:49.750\nI'm hoping I do a good job,\nand let's hope I do.\n\n548\n00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:54.790\nBut the reality is I'm unfortunately\nreacting as opposed to being proactive.\n\n549\n00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:58.430\nAnd we're never coming from a position\nof strength when we're reacting.\n\n550\n00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:00.560\nWe're always playing by\nsomebody else's rules.\n\n551\n00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.660\nAnd this is what we have to realize and\nthink about with regards to malware.\n\n552\n00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:09.240\n&gt;&gt; Malware, bad stuff,\ndon't get it cuz it's bad.\n\n553\n00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:10.290\nYou don't want it.\n\n554\n00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:12.540\nWe've gone through a few\ndifferent types of malware.\n\n555\n00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:15.810\nNow hopefully you have a good\nfoundational knowledge of the differences\n\n556\n00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:19.590\nbetween a worm or a virus or a trojan,\nspyware, things of that nature.\n\n557\n00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:22.180\nIt's good be able to\ncategorize exactly what it is\n\n558\n00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:24.760\nthat you might be dealing with or\nthat you need to deal with.\n\n559\n00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.240\nAnd then of course what do we do\nto prevent these types of things?\n\n560\n00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:31.910\nWhat's the methodology we need to\ntake steps necessary to prevent and\n\n561\n00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:37.240\nthen end or mediate or remediate these\nproblems if they do occur, hopefully not.\n\n562\n00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.380\nI've been down that road, though.\n\n563\n00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:43.210\nAnd it is something that's probably going\nto happen if you work in this business for\n\n564\n00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:44.400\nany length of time.\n\n565\n00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.921\nAdam, thank you so much for\nexplaining malware to us.\n\n566\n00:27:47.921 --> 00:27:51.720\nIf you didn't know what it was before,\nhopefully you surely do now.\n\n567\n00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:54.340\nThat being said, I'm looking at our\nclock and we are well out of time for\n\n568\n00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:55.180\nthis episode.\n\n569\n00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:58.690\nWe do appreciate you guys for\njoining us, but signing off for ITProTV,\n\n570\n00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:01.040\nI've been your

from\n\n3\n00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:05.170\nSan Francisco.\n\n4\n00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.495\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.495 --> 00:00:11.891\nYou're watching IPProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.891 --> 00:00:15.752\nAll right, greetings everyone, and welcome\nback to another great episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.752 --> 00:00:19.712\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode, we are moving on.\n\n8\n00:00:19.712 --> 00:00:24.196\nTrudging forward with more on our,\n[LAUGH] ECIH.\n\n9\n00:00:24.196 --> 00:00:25.194\n&gt;&gt; Did you say Trojan forward or\ntrudging forward?\n\n10\n00:00:25.194 --> 00:00:25.920\n&gt;&gt; Trudging, trudging forward.\n\n11\n00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.560\nTrudging, that's right.\n\n12\n00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.840\nThat's right.\n&gt;&gt; I thought you were trying to bring that\n\n13\n00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.420\ntheme through from our last episode.\n\n14\n00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.656\n&gt;&gt; We move forward with intensity.\n\n15\n00:00:30.656 --> 00:00:31.600\nAll right.\n\n16\n00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.220\nAnd of course helping us move forward\nis our good friend, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n17\n00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.190\nAdam, welcome back, sir.\n\n18\n00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.280\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, thank you very much.\n\n19\n00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.660\nGood to be back with everybody.\n\n20\n00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.090\nSo we're gonna talk a little about,\na little bit more about, I should say,\n\n21\n00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.120\nwhat we've been talking a lot\nabout already, concepts,\n\n22\n00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.050\nincident handling, incident response.\n\n23\n00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.190\nTake a slightly different approach.\n\n24\n00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.740\nI mentioned in one of our earlier\nepisodes the concept of insider threats,\n\n25\n00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.450\nwhy they're so important,\nwhy we have to pay attention to them,\n\n26\n00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.580\ntold you we'd have a little\nbit more to say about them.\n\n27\n00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.060\nAnd so here we are,\na little bit more to say about them.\n\n28\n00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.295\nInsider threats, bad.\n\n29\n00:00:58.295 --> 00:01:00.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Outsider threats, even worse, right?\n\n30\n00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.955\nSo we wanna make sure we understand,\nall joking aside,\n\n31\n00:01:03.955 --> 00:01:07.841\nwanna make sure we understand that as\nI indicated in my earlier remarks,\n\n32\n00:01:07.841 --> 00:01:10.516\nthat a lot of the activity\nwe have to worry about and\n\n33\n00:01:10.516 --> 00:01:13.857\nbe on guard against comes from outside,\ncertainly, right?\n\n34\n00:01:13.857 --> 00:01:17.160\nUnknown strangers,\nstranger danger, all that.\n\n35\n00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.100\nBut a lot of that activity comes\nfrom people we know, we work with,\n\n36\n00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.430\nand are on the inside, trusted.\n\n37\n00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.780\nAnd known to us.\n\n38\n00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.199\n&gt;&gt; Everybody's got that weird uncle,\nright?\n\n39\n00:01:25.199 --> 00:01:27.780\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Everybody does, everybody does.\n\n40\n00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.600\nBut, you know, aside from wierd family\nmembers and things of that nature,\n\n41\n00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.170\nwe gotta think about the fact that, and as\nI mentioned earlier, when we talked about\n\n42\n00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.560\nthis, somebody who's already on the inside\nas a trusted coworker, a colleague,\n\n43\n00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.080\na peer, whatever you would call them.\n\n44\n00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.235\nAnd somebody who already has access to\nsystems, has knowledge of our networks,\n\n45\n00:01:45.235 --> 00:01:51.380\nunderstands procedure process, understands\nessentially where the landmines are and\n\n46\n00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.020\nhow to navigate around them, is a much\nmore, much, much more formidable foe.\n\n47\n00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.130\nI had to say that seriously so I didn't\nsay formidable, I said formidable foe.\n\n48\n00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.881\nSo I didn't say formidable for.\n\n49\n00:02:02.881 --> 00:02:04.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or whatever it would have come\n\n50\n00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.340\nout backwards as.\n\n51\n00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.630\n&gt;&gt; But you know when you think about\nthe fact that people on the inside,\n\n52\n00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.560\nwith insider knowledge, doing stuff and\ntrying to gain advantage, can reek so\n\n53\n00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.690\nmuch more havoc than people who are on\nthe outside and have to guess about this.\n\n54\n00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.720\nBecause they already understand\nsome of the most important things\n\n55\n00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.700\nthat outsiders and strangers may not.\n\n56\n00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.010\nThey understand where\nthe monitoring mechanisms are,\n\n57\n00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.690\nthey understand what the dos and\ndon'ts are that can lead\n\n58\n00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.720\nto suspicion being raised, and\ntherefore compromised, being found out.\n\n59\n00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.690\nAnd they know that if they're\nessentially what we often call low and\n\n60\n00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.850\nslow, if they are taking their time\nbeing methodical and being patient.\n\n61\n00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.675\nAmple opportunities will arise for them\nto be able to operate in the system, and\n\n62\n00:02:43.675 --> 00:02:47.220\nmost likely operate in a way that we\nmay not find to be problematic and\n\n63\n00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.040\nmay not raise red flags around.\n\n64\n00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.770\nAnd this is the danger of insider attacks.\n\n65\n00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.320\nAnd this is the danger that as incident\nmanagers, incident responders,\n\n66\n00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.320\nincident handlers, we have to think about.\n\n67\n00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.100\nBecause it's the people that are trusted\nby us that can do the most harm.\n\n68\n00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.930\nIt's not to say we shouldn't trust people.\n\n69\n00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.160\nIt's not to say that we shouldn't give\npeople the opportunity to do things and\n\n70\n00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.540\nnot necessarily be looking over\ntheir shoulder all the time.\n\n71\n00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.625\nBut we come back to this idea of trust but\nverify.\n\n72\n00:03:14.625 --> 00:03:18.375\nThere's nothing wrong with trusting\nsomebody with keys and passwords.\n\n73\n00:03:18.375 --> 00:03:22.845\nBut put a system in place to monitor their\nuse and that way, even if it's not them,\n\n74\n00:03:22.845 --> 00:03:26.575\nbut it's somebody that takes advantage of\ntheir credential pretending to be them,\n\n75\n00:03:26.575 --> 00:03:29.655\nwe'll have a record of the fact\nthat something went wrong, right?\n\n76\n00:03:29.655 --> 00:03:30.965\nIt would be foolish.\n\n77\n00:03:30.965 --> 00:03:38.550\nFoolhardy of you or of your organization\nto allow this kind of behavior to go on.\n\n78\n00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.563\nIf you could prevent it and or\nmonitor and find out about it,\n\n79\n00:03:41.563 --> 00:03:44.592\nsimply by putting systems in\nplace that don't single out.\n\n80\n00:03:44.592 --> 00:03:47.010\nDon't target any one individual.\n\n81\n00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.320\nBut monitor everything that\neverybody does equally.\n\n82\n00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.700\nWe're not looking to say,\nwell it must be Bob, so\n\n83\n00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:53.980\nlet's just really pay attention to Bob.\n\n84\n00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.540\nAnd we know if we stick with Bob long\nenough that where going to find that\n\n85\n00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.850\nBob's doing this.\n\n86\n00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.740\nEverybody should be monitored equally\n\n87\n00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.460\nfrom the head of the organization to the\nperson in the most entry level position.\n\n88\n00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.010\nEverybody has the same opportunity and\nsame chance to do right and wrong.\n\n89\n00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.340\nAnd we should treat everybody equally and\nfairly.\n\n90\n00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.840\nNobody is guilty by extension or\nby assumption.\n\n91\n00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.630\nBut nobody is gonna be\nable to do something\n\n92\n00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.370\nthat can lead to compromise\nwithout us having a record of it.\n\n93\n00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.950\nAnd that's what the thought process should\nbe, and what we should be thinking about.\n\n94\n00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.980\nNot guilty until proven innocent,\nnot guilty by association, but\n\n95\n00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.210\nrather we should ensure that everybody\nhas ample opportunity to do their job and\n\n96\n00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.090\ndo it well.\n\n97\n00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.760\nBut we should monitoring all the time and\nlooking for\n\n98\n00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.210\nthe outliers that lead to compromise.\n\n99\n00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.530\nAnd those are the things that\nwe spend time focusing on.\n\n100\n00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.560\nNow, not everybody likes that\nthought process, by the way.\n\n101\n00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.620\nNot everybody feels that's appropriate.\n\n102\n00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.010\nNot everybody feels that that is something\nthat they're comfortable with, and\n\n103\n00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.640\nI understand that, I respect that opinion.\n\n104\n00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.040\nLet me be clear with all of you and\n\n105\n00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.230\nwith clear with anybody who may watch\nthis at any point in the future.\n\n106\n00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.710\nYou make have to make decisions\nas security professionals,\n\n107\n00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.840\nas incident handlers, as organizations\nabout what level of privacy and\n\n108\n00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.590\nprotection you feel it's appropriate\nto afford your employees.\n\n109\n00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.480\nBut, the thing you have to do beyond that,\nis then unequivocably and\n\n110\n00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.420\nclearly communicate to them what\nthe expectation of privacy is\n\n111\n00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.150\nin the the organization,\nwhile using organization assets.\n\n112\n00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.970\nSo there is no, let me underscore the word\nno, no misunderstanding about where\n\n113\n00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.700\npeople are and are not able to operate,\nand what they are and are not able to do.\n\n114\n00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.950\nWithout scrutiny, right?\n\n115\n00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.760\nThis is something you\nhave to be clear about.\n\n116\n00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.890\nIf the organizational culture says,\nwe're gonna observe everybody equally.\n\n117\n00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.690\nAnd again, let me be clear,\nwe're not singling people out.\n\n118\n00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.860\nThat is wrong and unacceptable behavior\nunless it is very narrowly defined during\n\n119\n00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.350\nthe course of an investigation where there\nwas already suspicion of wrongdoing.\n\n120\n00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:54.938\nAnd you have gone through proper HR,\nproper legal, proper policy based and\n\n121\n00:05:54.938 --> 00:05:59.582\nsenior management based channels\nto receive authorization.\n\n122\n00:05:59.582 --> 00:06:02.866\nAnd document the fact that you\nare now gonna focus on one or\n\n123\n00:06:02.866 --> 00:06:07.384\nmore individuals because of likelihood\nof suspicion, and you're gonna do so\n\n124\n00:06:07.384 --> 00:06:12.360\nin some very structured, very formal, and\nvery rigidly managed and overseen ways.\n\n125\n00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.539\nIt's the only time that kind of\nbehavior is acceptable and only for\n\n126\n00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:18.603\nthe duration of the time it takes\nto figure out whether they are or\n\n127\n00:06:18.603 --> 00:06:22.570\nare not doing the things that they have\npotentially been thought of as doing.\n\n128\n00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.432\nAnd once we have evidence unequivocally\neither way, we stop that monitoring and\n\n129\n00:06:26.432 --> 00:06:29.270\nwe either prosecute a case, or\nwe destroy that evidence and\n\n130\n00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.371\nmake it clear that they're no\nlonger under suspicion, right?\n\n131\n00:06:32.371 --> 00:06:35.524\nBut that's the only time this is\nacceptable behavior to single out\n\n132\n00:06:35.524 --> 00:06:36.760\nan individual.\n\n133\n00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.240\nHaving said that,\nthere are reasons why you may do that.\n\n134\n00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.760\nYou have to be aware of that.\n\n135\n00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.860\nBut what I'm suggesting is broadly\nmonitoring equally everybody.\n\n136\n00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.217\nMeaning when somebody picks up\nthe phone in an organization,\n\n137\n00:06:47.217 --> 00:06:50.778\nuses a corporate owned asset,\nthey may be subject to recording.\n\n138\n00:06:50.778 --> 00:06:56.083\nAnd that's perfectly acceptable, as long\nas the policy clearly states and everybody\n\n139\n00:06:56.083 --> 00:07:00.949\nis made aware of it, that any phone call\nmade on a corporate asset at any moment in\n\n140\n00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:05.330\ntime may be subject to monitoring and\nmay very likely be recorded.\n\n141\n00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.010\nAs long as you notify people,\n\n142\n00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.730\nyou have given them the opportunity\nto opt in or opt out.\n\n143\n00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.210\nIf they want to have a private\nconversation with a doctor,\n\n144\n00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.510\nwith a family member,\nwhoever, doesn't matter.\n\n145\n00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:18.460\nAnything that's not for public\nconsumption, then they should take it\n\n146\n00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.040\noutside the building, get on a cell phone\nthat doesn't belong to the company.\n\n147\n00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.100\nGo somewhere where they're not gonna\nbe heard and have that phone call.\n\n148\n00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.700\nAnd that's perfectly fine.\n\n149\n00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.820\nBut, they shouldn't do it on a phone\nsitting at their desk that runs across our\n\n150\n00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.990\ncorporate network as a corporate-owned and\ncorporate-managed asset.\n\n151\n00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.410\nThat would be inappropriate.\n\n152\n00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:39.520\nAnd if we have those usage policies in\nplace, people can't fight against that and\n\n153\n00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.060\nsay, but, I didn't know.\n\n154\n00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:41.805\nWell, Mr.\n\n155\n00:07:41.805 --> 00:07:46.040\nand Mrs. Jones clearly signed the employee\nhandbook here that says that you read it.\n\n156\n00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.350\nAnd part of reading it implies you\nshould know our policies, right?\n\n157\n00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:52.320\nBut it's not enough for us to assume\nyou read it once five years ago and\n\n158\n00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.610\ntherefore you remember.\n\n159\n00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:57.655\nWe should be, and we keep coming back to\nthis, executing training and awareness.\n\n160\n00:07:57.655 --> 00:08:02.195\nAnd part of that should be on a refresh\ncycle, quarterly, semi-annually, annually,\n\n161\n00:08:02.195 --> 00:08:04.567\nreminding people of\nthese kinds of policies.\n\n162\n00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:09.203\n&gt;&gt; And ensuring that everybody understands\nthat part of the expectation of\n\n163\n00:08:09.203 --> 00:08:14.400\nprivacy is the expectation of protection\nand we have to balance those two.\n\n164\n00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.547\nAnd oftentimes in corporate environments,\nthe expectation of privacy is\n\n165\n00:08:18.547 --> 00:08:23.106\nzero to very minimally existent and the\nexpectation of protection is very broad.\n\n166\n00:08:23.106 --> 00:08:27.224\nBecause we're gonna sacrifice that\nexpectation of privacy in favor\n\n167\n00:08:27.224 --> 00:08:29.354\nof expectation of protection, but\n\n168\n00:08:29.354 --> 00:08:33.614\nwe're gonna clearly tell you that\nthat's the case at least we should,\n\n169\n00:08:33.614 --> 00:08:38.018\nas I indicated and assuming we do,\nthen there really is no grey area here.\n\n170\n00:08:38.018 --> 00:08:40.570\nYou understand everything you\ndo is subject to monitoring.\n\n171\n00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:43.410\nAnd if you do something that is\nnot supposed to be done which is\n\n172\n00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:46.750\nwhy we monitor,\nwe're most likely gonna find out about it.\n\n173\n00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:50.570\nThat's how we deal with the insider\nthreat and this is a very important and\n\n174\n00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:54.180\nvery timely conversation at any\nmoment in time, but especially\n\n175\n00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:58.380\ngiven the kinds of issues and concerns\nthat we see in the workplace today.\n\n176\n00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:02.810\nInappropriate usage of corporate assets,\ninappropriate usage of social media.\n\n177\n00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.203\nThere's all sorts of things that go on.\n\n178\n00:09:06.203 --> 00:09:11.066\nInappropriate exfiltration of data through\na corporate system whether it's account\n\n179\n00:09:11.066 --> 00:09:15.931\ninformation, personally identifiable\ninformation, corporate IP, intellectual\n\n180\n00:09:15.931 --> 00:09:19.862\nproperty, industrial espionage,\nthe use of data loss prevention,\n\n181\n00:09:19.862 --> 00:09:24.394\nDOP technology, DRM and IRM, data rights\nand information rights management,\n\n182\n00:09:24.394 --> 00:09:28.018\ntechnologies to prevent\nunauthorized usage and duplication.\n\n183\n00:09:28.018 --> 00:09:32.647\nThese are tools and technologies that\nincident managers, incident handlers,\n\n184\n00:09:32.647 --> 00:09:36.255\nincident practitioners and\nprofessionals, and security and\n\n185\n00:09:36.255 --> 00:09:40.680\nIT professionals should be aware of and\nshould be deploying and using.\n\n186\n00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:45.020\nSpam filtering for email, attachment\nfiltering for email, inbound and\n\n187\n00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:49.910\noutbound call monitoring, printing and\nmonitoring of printing information using\n\n188\n00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:52.580\naccount numbers that tie\nback to individuals.\n\n189\n00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.197\nSo, we know who printed what.\n\n190\n00:09:54.197 --> 00:09:58.351\nMaking sure that we understand what's\non someone's hard drive by scanning and\n\n191\n00:09:58.351 --> 00:10:00.717\nusing software that tells us what's there.\n\n192\n00:10:00.717 --> 00:10:02.790\nMonitoring what they do\nwith their applications,\n\n193\n00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:05.496\nare they going to appropriate,\ninappropriate places on the web?\n\n194\n00:10:05.496 --> 00:10:06.295\nWe wanna know.\n\n195\n00:10:06.295 --> 00:10:08.370\nWe should be able to look\nat what's in your cache and\n\n196\n00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:10.410\nunderstand what you've been doing.\n\n197\n00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:14.086\nAgain, you may not feel that's\nappropriate behavior as an individual.\n\n198\n00:10:14.086 --> 00:10:18.378\nI respect that and I understand that, but\nyou have to understand that if you opt\n\n199\n00:10:18.378 --> 00:10:22.343\ninto a usage policy that allows for\nthis to happen, you have given up your\n\n200\n00:10:22.343 --> 00:10:26.848\nopportunity and right to voice your\nopinion and say, I don't feel comfortable.\n\n201\n00:10:26.848 --> 00:10:29.079\nNot that, that opinions not important, but\n\n202\n00:10:29.079 --> 00:10:31.964\nyou've opted in and\ntherefore that is the accepted norm.\n\n203\n00:10:31.964 --> 00:10:33.735\nYou have to make a choice in other words.\n\n204\n00:10:33.735 --> 00:10:37.779\nIf the company decides this is what\nthey're going to do in order to safeguard\n\n205\n00:10:37.779 --> 00:10:41.823\nthe average individual and all\nthe corporate assets, you're gonna have to\n\n206\n00:10:41.823 --> 00:10:46.121\nunderstand the behavior you feel is\nappropriate from your own perspective, but\n\n207\n00:10:46.121 --> 00:10:50.605\nmay run afoul of the corporate policy has\nto be conducted on non-corporate assets on\n\n208\n00:10:50.605 --> 00:10:51.909\nnon-corporate time.\n\n209\n00:10:51.909 --> 00:10:52.565\nYou go home and\n\n210\n00:10:52.565 --> 00:10:56.232\ndo it on a machine that has nothing to do\nwith your corporate entity and that may or\n\n211\n00:10:56.232 --> 00:10:58.827\nmay not be acceptable, but\nthat's up to you to decide.\n\n212\n00:10:58.827 --> 00:11:01.804\nIt has nothing to do with\nthe company at that point, but\n\n213\n00:11:01.804 --> 00:11:05.691\ninsider threats are very difficult for\nus to address in certain cases,\n\n214\n00:11:05.691 --> 00:11:10.096\nbecause we have to have these policies in\nplace and these procedures in place that\n\n215\n00:11:10.096 --> 00:11:13.766\nlock down what we're doing and\nreally focus our attention there.\n\n216\n00:11:13.766 --> 00:11:15.105\nInsiders can be anybody.\n\n217\n00:11:15.105 --> 00:11:18.380\nCurrent employees, former employees\nthat may still have access,\n\n218\n00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.628\ncuz it was not removed for\nvariety of reasons.\n\n219\n00:11:20.628 --> 00:11:25.014\nSomebody in HR and management that may\nhave rights to other areas, other systems,\n\n220\n00:11:25.014 --> 00:11:28.964\nother individual's records that cannot\nbe seen by everybody may decide to\n\n221\n00:11:28.964 --> 00:11:32.224\ngo through and look at information\nin an inappropriate way for\n\n222\n00:11:32.224 --> 00:11:33.625\ninappropriate reasons.\n\n223\n00:11:33.625 --> 00:11:34.713\nMaybe business partners.\n\n224\n00:11:34.713 --> 00:11:38.977\nWe've talked about federation and\nvendor relationships, and risk up,\n\n225\n00:11:38.977 --> 00:11:40.566\nand down the supply chain.\n\n226\n00:11:40.566 --> 00:11:43.598\nThese are areas that we need\nto focus on and be aware of.\n\n227\n00:11:43.598 --> 00:11:46.789\nThe anatomy of an insider attack\nis as I've already described,\n\n228\n00:11:46.789 --> 00:11:50.571\nsomebody who already intimately\nunderstands our business, our process,\n\n229\n00:11:50.571 --> 00:11:54.526\nour way of doing things, knows essentially\nwhere the land mines are as I said and\n\n230\n00:11:54.526 --> 00:11:56.498\nknows where the skeletons are buried.\n\n231\n00:11:56.498 --> 00:11:57.449\nYou think about that.\n\n232\n00:11:57.449 --> 00:11:59.610\nThey have credentials and trust already.\n\n233\n00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:00.706\nThey are on the inside.\n\n234\n00:12:00.706 --> 00:12:02.334\nThere's no guesswork there.\n\n235\n00:12:02.334 --> 00:12:03.878\nThey already know where everything is.\n\n236\n00:12:03.878 --> 00:12:07.283\nThey deploy malware, they activate\nmalware, they hack systems and\n\n237\n00:12:07.283 --> 00:12:08.169\ngain advantage.\n\n238\n00:12:08.169 --> 00:12:11.646\nThis is the five step methodology that\nwe have to think about and be aware of.\n\n239\n00:12:11.646 --> 00:12:15.814\nWe wanna make sure we understand that and\nthat we take that into account.\n\n240\n00:12:15.814 --> 00:12:19.281\nWhat about the ways different techniques\nare used to may be able to be used to\n\n241\n00:12:19.281 --> 00:12:20.394\ndetect cyber threats?\n\n242\n00:12:20.394 --> 00:12:22.852\nI've mentioned these already,\nbut let's go back and\n\n243\n00:12:22.852 --> 00:12:24.728\nmake sure we're comfortable and clear.\n\n244\n00:12:24.728 --> 00:12:28.804\nWe can correlate behavior looking at\ndifferent things that are going on in\n\n245\n00:12:28.804 --> 00:12:32.896\ndifferent systems to say, well,\nif you're doing this, this and this.\n\n246\n00:12:32.896 --> 00:12:36.845\nWe're detecting these kinds of\nthings maybe that's behavior that\n\n247\n00:12:36.845 --> 00:12:41.417\nis problematic and maybe if we piece\ntogether activity from different areas,\n\n248\n00:12:41.417 --> 00:12:46.510\nthen we can correlate that and make sure\nthat all makes sense and understand that.\n\n249\n00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:48.241\nMaybe anomaly detection would be used.\n\n250\n00:12:48.241 --> 00:12:49.107\nWhat are outliers?\n\n251\n00:12:49.107 --> 00:12:52.322\nWhat are outlying behaviors that\npeople don't normally engage in but\n\n252\n00:12:52.322 --> 00:12:53.257\nall of a sudden are?\n\n253\n00:12:53.257 --> 00:12:54.593\nNobody works at 2 o'clock in the morning.\n\n254\n00:12:54.593 --> 00:12:57.966\nAll of a sudden, you're in the office\nevery night at 2 o'clock in the morning\n\n255\n00:12:57.966 --> 00:12:59.817\nfor two weeks straight showing up to work.\n\n256\n00:12:59.817 --> 00:13:03.331\nThat's unusual, unless you're on\na project that somebody's told you, hey,\n\n257\n00:13:03.331 --> 00:13:06.949\nthis is when you're there and this is what\nyou're doing and you've got some sort of\n\n258\n00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:10.020\nauthorization to do that for a manager and\nyou may very well have that.\n\n259\n00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:11.798\nThere's nothing wrong with\nthat if that's the case.\n\n260\n00:13:11.798 --> 00:13:14.775\nBut if you don't, you're just randomly\nshowing up at 2 in the morning,\n\n261\n00:13:14.775 --> 00:13:15.889\nthat's a little unusual.\n\n262\n00:13:15.889 --> 00:13:17.048\nWe wanna know what's going on with that.\n\n263\n00:13:17.048 --> 00:13:19.061\nWe would call that anomaly detection.\n\n264\n00:13:19.061 --> 00:13:21.614\nWhat about pattern discovery, looking for\n\n265\n00:13:21.614 --> 00:13:25.271\nbehavioral items that occur in\nsome sort of sequential order or\n\n266\n00:13:25.271 --> 00:13:29.894\nsome sort of repetitious order that\nindicate certain things may be happening.\n\n267\n00:13:29.894 --> 00:13:34.338\nIf end of month close out every\nmonth around financials takes place\n\n268\n00:13:34.338 --> 00:13:38.082\naround the 28th, 29th,\n30th, whatever it is.\n\n269\n00:13:38.082 --> 00:13:43.152\nAnd on the 27th, you're always showing\nup in the accounting office having to\n\n270\n00:13:43.152 --> 00:13:48.391\ndo maintenance on the accounting systems\nand upload software and deal with that.\n\n271\n00:13:48.391 --> 00:13:51.178\nWe may find that pattern three or\nfour months in and wonder,\n\n272\n00:13:51.178 --> 00:13:54.191\nbecause those systems don't need\nto be addressed every month,\n\n273\n00:13:54.191 --> 00:13:56.499\ncertainly not right around\nin a month's close.\n\n274\n00:13:56.499 --> 00:13:59.698\nBut if you're in there every month\nmaking sure you have backdoor access,\n\n275\n00:13:59.698 --> 00:14:02.227\nso you can get it and\nsee all of the financial data when it's\n\n276\n00:14:02.227 --> 00:14:05.440\naggregated over the next couple of\ndays and that's your cover to do that.\n\n277\n00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.846\nPattern discovery may find that.\n\n278\n00:14:07.846 --> 00:14:10.964\nSo this is the kind of thing that we need\nto be looking at and thinking about.\n\n279\n00:14:10.964 --> 00:14:14.649\nBecause again, this kind of behavior\ncan obviously be problematic.\n\n280\n00:14:14.649 --> 00:14:16.035\nWe wanna know what's going on.\n\n281\n00:14:16.035 --> 00:14:19.477\nHiding in plain sight as we often say\nis sometimes the most effective way to\n\n282\n00:14:19.477 --> 00:14:22.642\nexecute these kind of attacks,\nbecause it may be very difficult for\n\n283\n00:14:22.642 --> 00:14:24.767\npeople to understand what they're seeing.\n\n284\n00:14:24.767 --> 00:14:26.820\nYou act like you belong.\n\n285\n00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.660\nAct authoritative, challenge people and\n\n286\n00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.324\nit's very unlikely that they're\ngonna challenge you back.\n\n287\n00:14:31.324 --> 00:14:35.119\nMeaning, chances are good you can cover\na lot of this abhorrent behavior simply by\n\n288\n00:14:35.119 --> 00:14:38.819\nbeing right out in front about it and\nsaying, of course, I'm here doing this.\n\n289\n00:14:38.819 --> 00:14:41.528\nI have every to right to be this\nis what I'm supposed to be doing,\n\n290\n00:14:41.528 --> 00:14:42.866\nwhat are you talking about?\n\n291\n00:14:42.866 --> 00:14:43.763\nI don't know, maybe I'm wrong.\n\n292\n00:14:43.763 --> 00:14:46.860\nI mean,\nhow often does that kind of stuff happen?\n\n293\n00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:50.430\nHard to say, but the people that are real\nadamant about defending themselves\n\n294\n00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:53.480\nare typically the people that have\nsomething to hide more often than not.\n\n295\n00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.500\nI mean, think about it.\n\n296\n00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.107\nI'm not wild about somebody coming and\nsaying, I wanna look at your machine.\n\n297\n00:14:57.107 --> 00:14:58.450\nWe think you're doing something wrong.\n\n298\n00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:01.480\nBut if I have nothing to hide, then I\nhave no reason not to let you as long as\n\n299\n00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.385\nyou have a legitimate reason to look\nat my machine in the first place.\n\n300\n00:15:04.385 --> 00:15:05.711\nBut if I'm up to no good, yeah,\n\n301\n00:15:05.711 --> 00:15:08.771\nI'm gonna stand on my First Amendment\nrights like there's no tomorrow.\n\n302\n00:15:08.771 --> 00:15:10.009\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And tell you forget about it,\n\n303\n00:15:10.009 --> 00:15:10.827\nyou're not touching this.\n\n304\n00:15:10.827 --> 00:15:11.827\nIt doesn't belong to you.\n\n305\n00:15:11.827 --> 00:15:14.361\nI've got new for you, it doesn't\nbelong to us belongs to the company,\n\n306\n00:15:14.361 --> 00:15:15.342\nit doesn't belong to you.\n\n307\n00:15:15.342 --> 00:15:18.896\nJust because you rent it from us everyday,\nit doesn't mean it's yours.\n\n308\n00:15:18.896 --> 00:15:24.073\nSo, gotta think about that and\njust have that thought process in mind.\n\n309\n00:15:24.073 --> 00:15:25.903\nWhen we're detecting insider threats,\n\n310\n00:15:25.903 --> 00:15:28.370\nwe can think of it from a lot\nof different perspectives.\n\n311\n00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:32.451\nA lot of this begins with HR as we're\nhiring people and doing background checks,\n\n312\n00:15:32.451 --> 00:15:35.091\nand thinking about where\nthey're coming from, and\n\n313\n00:15:35.091 --> 00:15:37.988\nwhat they represent themselves\nas versus what they are.\n\n314\n00:15:37.988 --> 00:15:41.547\nDo you have a policy that says,\nyou do background checks on all new hires?\n\n315\n00:15:41.547 --> 00:15:43.677\nDo you do credit checks and\nreference checks?\n\n316\n00:15:43.677 --> 00:15:46.486\nAnd these kind of things\nare pretty standard today.\n\n317\n00:15:46.486 --> 00:15:48.668\nBut for a long time,\nthey may not have been and\n\n318\n00:15:48.668 --> 00:15:50.630\nmany companies that I work with do them.\n\n319\n00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:52.530\nMany companies that I work with don't.\n\n320\n00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:56.538\nA lot of companies troll social media\ntoday looking at your profiles to figure\n\n321\n00:15:56.538 --> 00:16:00.610\nout who you are and what you do, and\nhow you represent yourself when you're not\n\n322\n00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:03.959\nspit polished, and shine sitting\nin a chair trying to get a job.\n\n323\n00:16:03.959 --> 00:16:07.166\nAnd, if they don't like what they see,\nthen they're not calling you back for\n\n324\n00:16:07.166 --> 00:16:07.810\nan interview.\n\n325\n00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:10.540\nI have this conversation\nwith my kids all the time.\n\n326\n00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:14.831\nThe mistakes you make,\nthese days at 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,\n\n327\n00:16:14.831 --> 00:16:18.820\n15 years old on social media,\nmay come back to haunt you five,\n\n328\n00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:20.860\nten years later when you're\nout looking for a job.\n\n329\n00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.410\nYou may not even think about it.\n\n330\n00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:26.430\nBut those are the kind of things that\npeople today have to worry about.\n\n331\n00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:29.985\nPeople of a certain generation may not\nhave those profiles sitting out on\n\n332\n00:16:29.985 --> 00:16:30.750\nsocial media.\n\n333\n00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:34.430\nAnd they might not have that history for\nyou to look at, right?\n\n334\n00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:36.710\nBut a lot of people do.\n\n335\n00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:39.751\nI make no bones about the fact that I'm\nout on social media in certain areas.\n\n336\n00:16:39.751 --> 00:16:42.622\nI tell people all the time, I'm on\nLinkedIn if you have a legitimate reason\n\n337\n00:16:42.622 --> 00:16:45.280\nto look me up professionally or\nwanna connect with me I invite you to.\n\n338\n00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.200\nI invite all of your who\nare listening to this too.\n\n339\n00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.898\nLove to connect with clients and students.\n\n340\n00:16:48.898 --> 00:16:51.830\nAlways stay connected to them,\nunderstand what their doing.\n\n341\n00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:53.350\nI love that, I think that's great.\n\n342\n00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:57.270\nBut I don't use LinkedIn as a social\nplatform to explain to the world that I'm\n\n343\n00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:00.948\nhaving coffee at 5 in the morning at\nthis particular place and check in,\n\n344\n00:17:00.948 --> 00:17:02.115\nthat's not what I do.\n\n345\n00:17:02.115 --> 00:17:05.349\nI'm not on those kind of social\nmedia networks actively and\n\n346\n00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:08.950\nI'm not using those kind of\nsocial media networks actively.\n\n347\n00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:12.110\nBecause I don't find there to be\nany professional value in them.\n\n348\n00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:13.260\nBut as a result,\n\n349\n00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:17.260\nI also don't have a social media trail\nthat follows me everywhere I go.\n\n350\n00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.590\nPeople can't look at it and\ntell you where I've been and\n\n351\n00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:22.800\nwhere I'm going and\nwhat I do every moment of every day.\n\n352\n00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.740\nThat's just not the kind of stuff\nyou wanna share with people, right?\n\n353\n00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:29.420\nBut at the same time you should be looking\nat that information as an incident\n\n354\n00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:33.080\nhandler, incident manager,\nincident responder, security professional.\n\n355\n00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:37.439\nThat's very big telltale sign about\nwhat people are, what they do, and\n\n356\n00:17:37.439 --> 00:17:40.659\nhow they behave when they're\noutside of the office.\n\n357\n00:17:40.659 --> 00:17:44.645\nAnd I'm not suggesting, and let me be\nclear because I get into this conversation\n\n358\n00:17:44.645 --> 00:17:48.515\na lot with people, I'm not suggesting\nthat it's okay to spy on people.\n\n359\n00:17:48.515 --> 00:17:49.245\nQuite the opposite.\n\n360\n00:17:49.245 --> 00:17:50.755\nI don't feel that's appropriate at all.\n\n361\n00:17:50.755 --> 00:17:55.190\nBut what I am suggesting to you is that\npublicly available information that people\n\n362\n00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:59.174\nhave gone out of their way to put out\nthere and associate with themselves in\n\n363\n00:17:59.174 --> 00:18:02.965\na way that allows others to find out\nabout it without breaking the law,\n\n364\n00:18:02.965 --> 00:18:05.623\nis perfectly fair game\nas far as I'm concerned.\n\n365\n00:18:05.623 --> 00:18:07.492\nAnd I don't think there's\nanything wrong with that.\n\n366\n00:18:07.492 --> 00:18:11.816\nI'm not saying that you scam somebody into\nmaking you a Facebook friend to see their\n\n367\n00:18:11.816 --> 00:18:13.690\nprofile when they kept it private.\n\n368\n00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:16.772\nThat's not appropriate behavior, and\nthat's not something you should do.\n\n369\n00:18:16.772 --> 00:18:20.737\nBut If they left their profile open and\nanybody can see it and you go out and\n\n370\n00:18:20.737 --> 00:18:21.582\nrun a search and\n\n371\n00:18:21.582 --> 00:18:26.070\nfind it there's something wrong with\nlooking at that absolutely nothing at all.\n\n372\n00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:29.343\nAnd that's the kind of stuff that\nI'm talking about when I say look at\n\n373\n00:18:29.343 --> 00:18:31.883\nbackground information,\ndevelop a full picture and\n\n374\n00:18:31.883 --> 00:18:33.587\nunderstanding of the individual.\n\n375\n00:18:33.587 --> 00:18:37.513\nYou'll know who they are and know more\nabout them than just what they present as\n\n376\n00:18:37.513 --> 00:18:41.378\na facade when they're in the office,\nwhich may very well be that person, but\n\n377\n00:18:41.378 --> 00:18:44.730\nmay also be very different than\nwhat that person is in other areas.\n\n378\n00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:48.247\nThis is part of understanding what\nthe insider threat may be, right?\n\n379\n00:18:48.247 --> 00:18:51.730\nExamine, respond to\nsuspicious behavior we find.\n\n380\n00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:54.072\nAnticipate, manage\nnegative workplace issues.\n\n381\n00:18:54.072 --> 00:18:56.371\nSomebody's gonna be terminated that day,\n\n382\n00:18:56.371 --> 00:18:59.830\nyou need to know that's probably\nnot gonna end well, right?\n\n383\n00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:01.250\nMake sure you anticipate that,\n\n384\n00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:04.930\nunderstand that employment verification\ncredit checks, we talked about that.\n\n385\n00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:07.304\nMake sure you have an information\nsecurity policy and\n\n386\n00:19:07.304 --> 00:19:09.104\nusage policy in the employee handbook.\n\n387\n00:19:09.104 --> 00:19:10.460\nWe talked about that as well.\n\n388\n00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:12.020\nHave everybody sign off on it.\n\n389\n00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.663\nMonitor and\nsecure not just the physical but\n\n390\n00:19:14.663 --> 00:19:17.172\nthe logical assets of the organization.\n\n391\n00:19:17.172 --> 00:19:19.930\nMake sure that you have\nasset tags on everything.\n\n392\n00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:23.280\nMake sure you have the ability to be\nable to locate those assets if needed,\n\n393\n00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.330\nremote wipe those assets if needed.\n\n394\n00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:27.784\nThese are the kind of things that you\nhave to think about today, right?\n\n395\n00:19:27.784 --> 00:19:30.997\nWith regards to things like network\nsecurity, we've talked about this,\n\n396\n00:19:30.997 --> 00:19:34.108\nmaking sure you're monitoring inbound and\noutbound network traffic,\n\n397\n00:19:34.108 --> 00:19:35.170\nlooking at usage.\n\n398\n00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:36.726\nRight, these are the kind of\nthings you wanna think about.\n\n399\n00:19:36.726 --> 00:19:40.925\nHave password policies,\nhave multi-factor authentication in place,\n\n400\n00:19:40.925 --> 00:19:45.539\nso people can't simply log on with a\nstolen username and password credentials.\n\n401\n00:19:45.539 --> 00:19:49.137\nSomebody looses an employee ID,\nhave a mandatory report period.\n\n402\n00:19:49.137 --> 00:19:53.111\nAnd if they don't report that ID as\nmissing, that maybe grounds for dismissal.\n\n403\n00:19:53.111 --> 00:19:56.699\nRight, in the military and the government,\nyou lose your CAC card or your smart card,\n\n404\n00:19:56.699 --> 00:19:59.750\nand you don't report that,\nyou actually can go to jail, right.\n\n405\n00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:04.012\nI mean it's that serious,\nbecause the access that credential may\n\n406\n00:20:04.012 --> 00:20:06.913\ngive a bad actor can\npotentially cost lives.\n\n407\n00:20:06.913 --> 00:20:10.637\nAnd I'm not saying that in your business,\nin our businesses for the most part,\n\n408\n00:20:10.637 --> 00:20:12.310\nit's quite that dramatic.\n\n409\n00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:15.930\nBut there are businesses where it may be,\nand you have to understand that.\n\n410\n00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:18.499\nAnd these things are given to you and\nentrusted to you.\n\n411\n00:20:18.499 --> 00:20:22.253\nAnd if they're used incorrectly, we have\nevery right and every responsibility to\n\n412\n00:20:22.253 --> 00:20:25.270\ncall you on that and make sure that\nwe understand what's going on.\n\n413\n00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:29.500\nSo think about that and make sure that\nyou're just aware of these kind of things.\n\n414\n00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:33.792\nWhat about, and this is always a touchy\nsubject and a sore subject for\n\n415\n00:20:33.792 --> 00:20:37.653\npeople to discuss, but\nwhat about administrators, right?\n\n416\n00:20:37.653 --> 00:20:40.950\nWhat about people that are supposed\nto oversee the other people?\n\n417\n00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:43.990\nWho watches the watchers is\nwhat I'm suggesting to you.\n\n418\n00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:47.686\nBecause when you think about this, you\nhave this conversation with administrators\n\n419\n00:20:47.686 --> 00:20:50.925\nand I have it with them all the time,\nthey say well we know better, right.\n\n420\n00:20:50.925 --> 00:20:52.349\nYou ever hear that conversation?\n\n421\n00:20:52.349 --> 00:20:54.784\nThat always, without exception,\nends poorly.\n\n422\n00:20:54.784 --> 00:20:57.770\nJust so you know in case you\nhaven't had that conversation.\n\n423\n00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:00.780\nBecause that's usually the conversation\nI'm having with somebody\n\n424\n00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:04.130\nwhen I'm cleaning up their mess\nbecause they did not know better.\n\n425\n00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:06.270\nOr if they did,\nthey didn't exercise good judgment and\n\n426\n00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:09.090\nshow me that they knew better\nthrough action indeed.\n\n427\n00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:12.350\nAs opposed to playing lip\nservice to the idea, right?\n\n428\n00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:15.300\nMonkey see, monkey do, right?\n\n429\n00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:18.840\nAnd do as I say, not as I do,\nare not good methodologies for\n\n430\n00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:21.095\nmanagement in the corporate world.\n\n431\n00:21:21.095 --> 00:21:24.910\nAdministrators should be playing by\nthe same exact rules as everybody else.\n\n432\n00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:27.350\nI don't care who you are,\nI don't care how long you've been there,\n\n433\n00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:31.000\nI don't care what you think you know, I\ndon't care how important you feel you are,\n\n434\n00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.550\nI don't care what you know about\nour systems that nobody else knows,\n\n435\n00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:36.890\nyou have a normal user\naccount like everybody else.\n\n436\n00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:40.130\nYou use that every day, and\nthe only time you use admin credentials\n\n437\n00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:42.460\nis when you're on a system\nthat is being audited and\n\n438\n00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:45.310\nthat you have to access it at\nthat level to do something.\n\n439\n00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:48.297\nAnd you understand that there's\na trail associated with that logon.\n\n440\n00:21:48.297 --> 00:21:51.420\nYou don't use your admin credential\nas your normal logon every day.\n\n441\n00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:55.650\nThat's the most ridiculous thing\nI hear whenever I hear it.\n\n442\n00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:58.150\nI don't understand why that happens,\nI just don't.\n\n443\n00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:00.190\nThat's just one of the most\nridiculous things in the world.\n\n444\n00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:02.510\nAnd yet, it happens all the time.\n\n445\n00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:04.321\nIn many, many situations, and\n\n446\n00:22:04.321 --> 00:22:08.145\nit's one of the primary reasons\nthat breaches are as dramatic, and\n\n447\n00:22:08.145 --> 00:22:12.124\nas impactful as they are, because\nwe know exactly who the admins are.\n\n448\n00:22:12.124 --> 00:22:14.193\nWe know how to go after those credentials,\n\n449\n00:22:14.193 --> 00:22:16.930\nif we get them we've got\naccess to everything.\n\n450\n00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:20.175\nIf we get you a normal user account,\nwe may be able to figure out other stuff,\n\n451\n00:22:20.175 --> 00:22:23.800\nit's gonna take us longer, and it's gonna\nbe harder to do without getting caught.\n\n452\n00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.580\nRemember this is a game of degrees, right.\n\n453\n00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:27.750\nThis is a game of time.\n\n454\n00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:31.230\nIf takes long enough to do something,\nchances are good\n\n455\n00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:35.210\nproper monitoring is gonna catch you and\nwe're gonna find out about it.\n\n456\n00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:39.742\nIf you could escalate a privilege through\nan escalation attack directly to the root\n\n457\n00:22:39.742 --> 00:22:43.885\nadmin credential, or whatever you call\nthat depending what OS you're on,\n\n458\n00:22:43.885 --> 00:22:45.070\nroot, admin, ect.\n\n459\n00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:49.028\nIf I can get to that end point that's\ngame over as far as I'm concerned.\n\n460\n00:22:49.028 --> 00:22:50.622\nIf I have your root credential,\n\n461\n00:22:50.622 --> 00:22:53.582\nyour admin credential I can\ntake your entire network away.\n\n462\n00:22:53.582 --> 00:22:55.548\nIt doesn't take long at all.\n\n463\n00:22:55.548 --> 00:22:59.427\nI can lock you out of every system, and\nI can shut down your monitoring and\n\n464\n00:22:59.427 --> 00:23:00.889\nI can decide what does, and\n\n465\n00:23:00.889 --> 00:23:05.365\ndoesn't work because you've probably\nhave if you're letting that happen.\n\n466\n00:23:05.365 --> 00:23:07.474\nHave probably used that\nsame admin credential and\n\n467\n00:23:07.474 --> 00:23:10.100\nset it up as the main credential\non almost every system.\n\n468\n00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:11.592\nWhich means if I get it for one,\n\n469\n00:23:11.592 --> 00:23:14.014\nI probably can get into\nalmost anything I want to.\n\n470\n00:23:14.014 --> 00:23:17.339\nAnd as silly as some of this conversation\nmay sound to you because you do things\n\n471\n00:23:17.339 --> 00:23:21.074\ndifferently, you know better, imagine all\nthe people out there that don't do things\n\n472\n00:23:21.074 --> 00:23:23.770\ndifferently, and don't know better.\n\n473\n00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:26.760\nAnd what kind of situational\nawareness they do or\n\n474\n00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:31.350\ndon't have and how much instant response\nthey probably are gonna need, right.\n\n475\n00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:35.690\nI mean this is where the life\nsupport systems have to really be\n\n476\n00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:40.220\nfocused because these networks, these\nsystems are in critical, critical danger.\n\n477\n00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:41.150\nThey just don't realize it.\n\n478\n00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:43.420\nThis is one of the big issues\nwith insider threats today.\n\n479\n00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:46.069\nSo we have to think about all these\ndifferent areas and concerns,\n\n480\n00:23:46.069 --> 00:23:47.478\nwhen we address insider threats.\n\n481\n00:23:47.478 --> 00:23:50.640\nPaying attention to what is normal and\ndeviation from norm.\n\n482\n00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.969\nIt's probably the biggest, and best,\nand most impactful thing we can do.\n\n483\n00:23:53.969 --> 00:23:57.499\nBut in addition, just monitoring,\nand telling everybody look,\n\n484\n00:23:57.499 --> 00:24:00.660\nno matter what you do,\nno matter who you are no exceptions.\n\n485\n00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:01.887\nEverybody's gonna be the same.\n\n486\n00:24:01.887 --> 00:24:04.221\nEverybody is gonna be paying\nattention to what we're doing and\n\n487\n00:24:04.221 --> 00:24:07.304\neverything that you do and everything I do\nis gonna be monitored We're not gonna use\n\n488\n00:24:07.304 --> 00:24:09.197\nthat against you,\nunless you do something wrong,\n\n489\n00:24:09.197 --> 00:24:12.200\nin which case, you're absolutely\nright we're gonna use it against you.\n\n490\n00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.590\nWe're gonna try to take you to court and\n\n491\n00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:16.100\nwe're gonna put you in jail\ncuz you shouldn't be doing it.\n\n492\n00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:18.770\nBut if you're not doing anything wrong,\nyou have nothing to worry about.\n\n493\n00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:21.980\nAll we're doing is simply monitoring\neverybody's behavior, and as long as you\n\n494\n00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:26.210\ndo what you're being paid to do, you show\nup to work everyday, you follow the rules,\n\n495\n00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:28.610\nthere's absolutely no reason why you\nshould even give it a second thought.\n\n496\n00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:29.970\nIf that's the mentality and\n\n497\n00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:33.400\nthe culture of the organization,\nthat's an organization I wanna work for.\n\n498\n00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.220\nThat's an organization\nI wanna be a part of.\n\n499\n00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:37.210\nThat's an organization that is secure.\n\n500\n00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:39.760\nThat's an organization that\nunderstands incident management.\n\n501\n00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:44.444\nThat's an organization that has\na culture of security that is looking to\n\n502\n00:24:44.444 --> 00:24:47.916\nsafeguard both individuals,\nassets, data, etc.\n\n503\n00:24:47.916 --> 00:24:51.302\nAnd not at the expense of any one\nindividual or any one asset, but for\n\n504\n00:24:51.302 --> 00:24:52.840\nthe betterment of all.\n\n505\n00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.910\nAnd that's the kind of organization\nthat you want to be a part of as an IT\n\n506\n00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:57.170\nsecurity professional.\n\n507\n00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:59.850\n&gt;&gt; Wow, the insider is definitely\nin a unique perspective,\n\n508\n00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:03.360\nor position should I say,\nto cause some real damage.\n\n509\n00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.790\nBecause there is that layer of\ntrust that we give to them,\n\n510\n00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:09.680\nwe're bringing them into\nthe circle of trust, right.\n\n511\n00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:13.700\nThat you have access to systems that\nmost people do not and, because of that,\n\n512\n00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:18.690\nwe have to really lay down a layer of,\nI'm going\n\n513\n00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:21.960\nto allow you to do this because I think\nthat you're going to handle it correctly,\n\n514\n00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:26.320\nso if they can be got to or\nthey turn against us as a thread actor,\n\n515\n00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:31.000\nthen we're in a real world of hurt\nbecause they have such a sensitive area.\n\n516\n00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.700\nIt's like being behind the chain mail,\nas it were, with a knife.\n\n517\n00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.540\nThe armor outside is doing\nme no good because there's\n\n518\n00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:39.700\nalready something underneath\nthere that can cause me damage.\n\n519\n00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:40.930\nSo, we have to be on the lookout.\n\n520\n00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:44.420\nThat's why we do things like do credit\nchecks, make sure that they have\n\n521\n00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:48.070\na good background that they're not doing\nthings, we're watching on social media,\n\n522\n00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:54.300\nthat can harm us as a company or just open\nus up to attack through their own vector.\n\n523\n00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:59.010\nThat being said, now that we realize\nthat threat actors can be on the inside.\n\n524\n00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:03.010\nWe have to be on the lookout for them,\nfollow Adam's advice to deal with that,\n\n525\n00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:04.400\nand if an incident does occur,\n\n526\n00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:08.460\nfollow his steps that he has given\nyou to remediate those incidents.\n\n527\n00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:10.790\nAdam, thank you for\nwalking us through this.\n\n528\n00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:13.890\nA lot of information when it\ncomes to insider threats.\n\n529\n00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:17.590\nDefinitely make sure that you guys go\nthrough that information a few times.\n\n530\n00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:20.620\nFigure out exactly what\ncan be gleaned from that.\n\n531\n00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:24.170\nBut I'm looking at our clock, and it\nseems like we've come out of time for yet\n\n532\n00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:25.420\nanother one of our great episodes.\n\n533\n00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:26.790\nHopefully you, guys, have enjoyed it.\n\n534\n00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:29.780\nWe definitely enjoy you guys,\njoining us every day.\n\n535\n00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:33.730\nBut we're gonna go ahead and sign off for\nITProTV, I've been your host,\n\n536\n00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:34.840\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n537\n00:26:34.840 -->

watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.242 --> 00:00:13.870\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n5\n00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.350\nWelcome to another great\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.600\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n7\n00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.460\nin today's episode we are moving\non with more on our ECIH series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.150\nAnd of course joining us back yet again\nfor another round of insider threats,\n\n9\n00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.780\nour good friend Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.570\nAdam welcome back today,\nhow's it going man?\n\n11\n00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.360\n&gt;&gt; How do?\n\n12\n00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.130\nOr Howdy?\n\n13\n00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.040\nDepending on where you're from I suppose.\n\n14\n00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.380\nIt kind of goes well.\n\n15\n00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.870\nWe are gonna continue\ntalking a little about,\n\n16\n00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.230\nactually showing you a little\nabout insider threats.\n\n17\n00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.820\nTalked a lot about it in the last episode.\n\n18\n00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.930\nHopefully, that's something\nyou've taken a look at, if not,\n\n19\n00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.420\nencourage you to go do that, as always and\nmake sure you're caught up with Daniel and\n\n20\n00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.820\nI as we continue to race through our\nincident handling conversations.\n\n21\n00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.510\nWe're gonna pause long enough to do\na little show and tell with you.\n\n22\n00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.630\nThought we would show you some of\nthe things, concerns, issues and tools.\n\n23\n00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.620\nThat may be associated\nwith insider threats.\n\n24\n00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.674\nYou had a lot of times when we're\nthinking about insider threats, and\n\n25\n00:01:03.674 --> 00:01:05.475\nwe talked about this in our discussion.\n\n26\n00:01:05.475 --> 00:01:09.035\nYeah, were dealing with people that\nare on the inside that are trusted by us.\n\n27\n00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:12.610\nBy us I mean the company,\nthe organization, the enterprise.\n\n28\n00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.619\nAnd as a result, we probably don't\nnecessarily, as we've established,\n\n29\n00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.373\npay as much attention to some\nof the things that may or\n\n30\n00:01:19.373 --> 00:01:22.775\nmay not be going on with them as\nwe would with strangers, right?\n\n31\n00:01:22.775 --> 00:01:26.944\nAnd that's fairly common when we work with\npeople and we do establish a rapport,\n\n32\n00:01:26.944 --> 00:01:29.060\na relationship, trust with them.\n\n33\n00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.910\nWe may or may not necessarily feel\nthat they should be monitored and\n\n34\n00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.340\nthat they should be observed.\n\n35\n00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.900\nThe same way with somebody\nthat we don't know shall be.\n\n36\n00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.710\nBut, this also opens up as we'll\ndiscuss the opportunities for\n\n37\n00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.130\nthem to potentially take\nadvantage of that trust.\n\n38\n00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.300\nRight, to play on and if you will,\nand to use it to their advantage.\n\n39\n00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.640\nAnd so, one of the ways that we can\ndemonstrate that and talk about,\n\n40\n00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.550\nthat would mean some of the tools\nthat would allow us to have set that,\n\n41\n00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.150\nis what I thought we've\nspent a few minutes on.\n\n42\n00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.710\nSo, if I said you did just\nbefore we go in and take a look.\n\n43\n00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.660\nAnd Daniel, first question,\nhave I shown you, told you, or\n\n44\n00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.126\ngiven you any indication\nof what I'm about to do.\n\n45\n00:02:03.126 --> 00:02:03.700\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n46\n00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.464\n&gt;&gt; Wrong answer.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n47\n00:02:04.464 --> 00:02:04.964\n&gt;&gt; Let's try that again.\n\n48\n00:02:04.964 --> 00:02:05.625\nRemember,\n\n49\n00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:09.650\nI said you only get a chocolate\nchip cookie if you're good, right?\n\n50\n00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.450\nSo, my point is Daniel doesn't\nknow what I'm about to do.\n\n51\n00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.026\n&gt;&gt; No idea.\n\n52\n00:02:13.026 --> 00:02:16.160\n&gt;&gt; But, what I'm gonna ask him is\npretty important question, right?\n\n53\n00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.920\nA question that a lot of us would wanna be\nthinking about I wanna Daniel's take on\n\n54\n00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.090\nbefore we actually go in.\n\n55\n00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.580\nWe'll take a look at the demo.\n\n56\n00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.450\nSo, if I ask you instead to you\nfrom an insider threat perspective.\n\n57\n00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.370\nWhat do you think would be let's\nsay either a category software or\n\n58\n00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.852\na type of software or tools and\nkind that an insider threat.\n\n59\n00:02:35.852 --> 00:02:39.950\nAn insider of that act that's looking to\ndo us harm from inside the organization.\n\n60\n00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.160\nWhat would be on the list of\nthings they may try to run,\n\n61\n00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.570\nthey may try to use against us?\n\n62\n00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.708\nWhat are some of those\nthings you may seek?\n\n63\n00:02:45.708 --> 00:02:47.468\n&gt;&gt; Probably some type of recording\nsoftware is always great, right?\n\n64\n00:02:47.468 --> 00:02:48.254\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n65\n00:02:48.254 --> 00:02:51.640\n&gt;&gt; To capture keyboard strokes,\nthings of that nature.\n\n66\n00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.757\nA web page screenshots,\nthat can definitely play heck on\n\n67\n00:02:55.757 --> 00:03:00.150\nany infrastructure,\nsensitive information getting out.\n\n68\n00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.450\nSo, that's where I would go.\n\n69\n00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.440\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nSo, that category recording software,\n\n70\n00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.480\nright, broadly we tend to refer to\nthat as keylogger software just\n\n71\n00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.470\nas a general term in our industry.\n\n72\n00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.600\nBut Daniel's absolutely right, that'll be\nat the top of the list, top of my list,\n\n73\n00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.240\ntop of his list, and through the magic\nof the the finger, there we go.\n\n74\n00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.005\nAnd I almost got it right so\nit went up as opposed to that way.\n\n75\n00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:21.860\n&gt;&gt; Right now, I'm It's the right way.\n\n76\n00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.440\n&gt;&gt; That was almost the right way, and\n\n77\n00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.610\nthrough the magic of our\ndemonstration environment.\n\n78\n00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.550\nWhat do we have on the screen but\na piece of key login software?\n\n79\n00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.070\nAmazing I tell you, absolutely amazing.\n\n80\n00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:39.600\nJust, the ability to be able to be on\nomnipotent that you possess when we talk.\n\n81\n00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.040\nJust never ceases to astound me, sir.\n\n82\n00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.090\nAll right, so the keylogger software\nis what we thought we would\n\n83\n00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.710\nspend a few minutes\njust showing you about.\n\n84\n00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:46.990\nNow keep in mind,\n\n85\n00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.950\nthere are 1,000 varieties of\nthis kind of software out there.\n\n86\n00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.400\nThis is just one of many.\n\n87\n00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.680\nThis may have features and functions\nthat you may or may not see in others.\n\n88\n00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.731\nIt's just used merely to\ndemonstrate the concept for you,\n\n89\n00:03:59.731 --> 00:04:01.754\nnot because it in any way shape or form.\n\n90\n00:04:01.754 --> 00:04:05.930\nWe think this is a good or\na bad or even a marginal product.\n\n91\n00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.670\nBut simply, just an average\nexample of a actual keylogger, and\n\n92\n00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:11.910\nI use it because I love the name.\n\n93\n00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.330\nThe keylogger's name is Actual Keylogger.\n\n94\n00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.710\nAs opposed to any other kind of keylogger.\n\n95\n00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:19.640\n&gt;&gt; Not actual keylogger [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or the non-keylogger keylogger.\n\n96\n00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.240\n&gt;&gt; That's what you should make your\nkeylogger called, not a keylogger.\n\n97\n00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.220\n&gt;&gt; Not a keylogger, right.\n\n98\n00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.130\nSomething other than a keylogger, right.\n\n99\n00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.090\nSo, with this particular\npiece of software,\n\n100\n00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.030\nlike many keyloggers, is something that\nwould be installed by a threat source,\n\n101\n00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.190\nby a bad actor, typically, on a machine,\nwhatever they're looking to target.\n\n102\n00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.230\nYou would install this\nin a variety of ways.\n\n103\n00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.070\nWe talked about, in some of our prior\nepisodes, around malicious code.\n\n104\n00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.160\nWe spoke about malware generically,\nthe idea that you may see this\n\n105\n00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.440\ndownloaded through the guise of a trojan,\nsome sort of program that looks good.\n\n106\n00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.050\nYou download it, this thing gets\ninstalled in the background.\n\n107\n00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.200\nSomebody may download this\nwithout knowing what it is,\n\n108\n00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.920\nexecute it without realizing it.\n\n109\n00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.190\nSome bad actor may go and\npurposely plant this on another machine\n\n110\n00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.350\nsecretly to get it running, so that nobody\nknows it's there to capture information.\n\n111\n00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.950\nThere's a variety of ways that this\nstuff may get into the environment.\n\n112\n00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.229\nBut, if we're thinking and\n\n113\n00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:13.115\nfocusing on in this discussion\nwhat an insider threat would be.\n\n114\n00:05:13.115 --> 00:05:17.177\nIt would be somebody that uses this\nsoftware to target specific machines\n\n115\n00:05:17.177 --> 00:05:20.650\nto attempt to get information\nfrom them that may be valuable.\n\n116\n00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.350\nLet's take a look at how we set this up.\n\n117\n00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.800\nAnd then, let's talk about the kind\nof information that we may get\n\n118\n00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.680\nusing a tool like this.\n\n119\n00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.330\nSo, if we go into the settings\nright over here on the left,\n\n120\n00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.700\nas you can see,\nyou'll see we have a little settings area.\n\n121\n00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.570\nWe go an click on full screen for\na minute, let's just take a look.\n\n122\n00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.860\nA little more depth in that so\nwe can see it better.\n\n123\n00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.090\nYou'll see in the settings area,\nwe've got general settings.\n\n124\n00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.250\nPretty straight forward.\n\n125\n00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.560\nWhere do we wanna keep the log for\nthis particular piece of software?\n\n126\n00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.780\nSo, where are we gonna get the output\nof all the stuff we're gonna capture.\n\n127\n00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.330\nHow are we gonna find that?\n\n128\n00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.690\nYou'll see program files X86,\nAK monitoring logs, right.\n\n129\n00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.430\nSo yeah, we would have that path and\nwe could change that or modify it,\n\n130\n00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.450\nput it anywhere we want.\n\n131\n00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.360\nWhat's text log maximum size?\n\n132\n00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.650\nSo, how big will it get?\n\n133\n00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.070\nWhat is the screenshot maximum size?\n\n134\n00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.530\nHow big will the screenshots be?\n\n135\n00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.800\nWe're gonna be able to take\nscreenshots of things,\n\n136\n00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:13.820\nbe able to log all keystrokes clear log\nfiles when they've seen maximum size.\n\n137\n00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.670\nMy or may not wanna do that, right?\n\n138\n00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.340\nEncrypt the log files so that they can't\nbe opened up by somebody snooping around\n\n139\n00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.790\nunless they know the password.\n\n140\n00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:21.810\nThings like that.\n\n141\n00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.770\nDo you wanna start this\nat the system load?\n\n142\n00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.850\nRight, that's where we start to get\nobviously the ability to be able to\n\n143\n00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:29.500\nhide this software, bury it so\n\n144\n00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.640\npeople don't know it's running\nstart monitoring it loading.\n\n145\n00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.700\nHide at start up, right?\n\n146\n00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.210\nSo when we do this,\n\n147\n00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.850\nwhat's gonna happen is this thing\nwill burrow itself into the system.\n\n148\n00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:41.180\nIt will come up as soon as\nthe system is ready to go.\n\n149\n00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.320\nIt will hide so it won't be available in\nthe systray, and you won't see it yet\n\n150\n00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.360\nit will be running in the background\nall of the time, right?\n\n151\n00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.411\nAnd that's exactly what we wanna have\nhappening with this kinda stealth\n\n152\n00:06:50.411 --> 00:06:50.920\nsoftware.\n\n153\n00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.342\nWe don't want to see it,\nwe don't wanna know it's there.\n\n154\n00:06:53.342 --> 00:06:56.202\nWell, obviously if the tar machine\nwe do wanna know it's there,\n\n155\n00:06:56.202 --> 00:06:58.968\nfrom the bad actor's perspective\nright the inside of threat.\n\n156\n00:06:58.968 --> 00:07:01.119\nThey wanna be able to\nsteal the software and\n\n157\n00:07:01.119 --> 00:07:03.540\nmake it appear if it's not there, right?\n\n158\n00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.470\nSo with hiding, remove the program\nshortcut from the desktop menu,\n\n159\n00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:10.860\nremove the program from\nthe start program menu, right?\n\n160\n00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.620\nRemove from add or remove programs,\nhide program folder.\n\n161\n00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.937\nYou can run the program via start run\nmenu, typing in the opened window and\n\n162\n00:07:18.937 --> 00:07:21.170\nthen specify what you wanna type.\n\n163\n00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:24.800\nSo clearly, we've got a lot of\noptions here that would allow us\n\n164\n00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.940\nto be able to really\nstealth this software.\n\n165\n00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.250\nAnd this, by the way,\nis a relatively simplistic key log, right?\n\n166\n00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:34.930\nThis is not one of the super duper,\nlet me really go all rootkit on you.\n\n167\n00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.676\nAnd really try to burrow in and\nmake it appear as if I don't exist,\n\n168\n00:07:38.676 --> 00:07:40.120\nninja kind of software.\n\n169\n00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.400\nThis is pretty basic.\n\n170\n00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.950\nWe've got some hotkeys,\nwe could specify here.\n\n171\n00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:47.714\nPassword settings if we do the encrypt and\nthen we do that password, right.\n\n172\n00:07:47.714 --> 00:07:50.041\nWe have to enable the password and set it,\n\n173\n00:07:50.041 --> 00:07:54.244\nthat we know if somebody sees the files\nthey won't be able to get into them.\n\n174\n00:07:54.244 --> 00:08:00.367\nRight, we set a little password here,\njust to make sure that we know what it is.\n\n175\n00:08:04.072 --> 00:08:08.054\nUse our standard super-duper,\nextra special secret ITProTV password,\n\n176\n00:08:08.054 --> 00:08:10.730\notherwise known as password\nexclamation point.\n\n177\n00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.585\nWe're not gonna tell you.\n\n178\n00:08:12.585 --> 00:08:13.489\n[CROSSTALK] That's the password.\n\n179\n00:08:13.489 --> 00:08:16.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All of you listening, right?\n\n180\n00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:16.870\n&gt;&gt; You're on a list.\n\n181\n00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:17.409\n&gt;&gt; You're on the list.\n\n182\n00:08:17.409 --> 00:08:18.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're coming to get you.\n\n183\n00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:19.650\nAnd you'll see now,\n\n184\n00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:22.850\nwe can reset the default settings\nobviously if we need to go in and do that.\n\n185\n00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:26.140\nSo we can go in and set those settings up.\n\n186\n00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.580\nWe can go in,\n\n187\n00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:32.700\nyou'll see here, to the log area, specify\nthe kind of activity we want to grab.\n\n188\n00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:37.660\nKeystrokes, screenshots, save,\nrun and or close the applications.\n\n189\n00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:40.600\nYou'll look at the clipboard,\nanything in the clipboard lets gather and\n\n190\n00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.240\ncapture some of that.\n\n191\n00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.940\nSay file and directory chains,\nthings we moved around.\n\n192\n00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:48.940\nLet's know where stuff is,\nright record, start-up and shutdown.\n\n193\n00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.520\nSave documents send to\nthe printer that's a big one.\n\n194\n00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.920\nRight documents being sent out to\nthe printer it's gonna copy all of those.\n\n195\n00:08:54.920 --> 00:09:00.440\nLet's say we might actually get this\nstuff on to a C-level executives machine,\n\n196\n00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.240\nmay be in the accounting department or\nsomething like that.\n\n197\n00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.650\nWe're gonna get copies of financials,\ncopies of all sorts of stuff.\n\n198\n00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:07.960\nWho knows what, right.\n\n199\n00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.400\nAnd then under each one, right,\n\n200\n00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:13.900\nspecify what keystrokes do we want,\nall keystrokes characters only.\n\n201\n00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.880\nRight, so\nwe can be a little selective there.\n\n202\n00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.420\nWhat kind of screenshots do we want?\n\n203\n00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:19.110\nScreenshots of active Windows?\n\n204\n00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:20.720\nWhat kind of image quality?\n\n205\n00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.450\nRight?\nCapture the cursor.\n\n206\n00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:24.180\nSo let's make sure we do that.\n\n207\n00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:27.270\nHow, what's the interval,\nhow long between screenshots do we want?\n\n208\n00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:31.530\nDo we want to be screenshotting\nevery 30 seconds, every two minutes,\n\n209\n00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:32.750\nthat kind of thing.\n\n210\n00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.800\nRight?\nStop taking screenshots if the system goes\n\n211\n00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.070\nidle for so many minutes,\n\n212\n00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:39.790\nso you're not just capturing\nthe lockout screen, that kind of thing.\n\n213\n00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:42.110\nRight?\nSo we can do a test screenshot and\n\n214\n00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:45.170\nthat's what we'll see there,\nnot too shabby, right?\n\n215\n00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:47.482\nWe can blow that up, zoom in there.\n\n216\n00:09:50.033 --> 00:09:50.840\nSee that pretty clearly.\n\n217\n00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.744\n&gt;&gt; Looks pretty good.\n\n218\n00:09:54.579 --> 00:09:56.627\n&gt;&gt; The word the.\n\n219\n00:09:56.627 --> 00:09:57.915\nIs made up of how many pixels?\n\n220\n00:09:57.915 --> 00:09:58.531\n&gt;&gt; The cursed.\n\n221\n00:09:58.531 --> 00:10:03.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n222\n00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.283\n&gt;&gt; You could see that's at 70% screen\n\n223\n00:10:05.283 --> 00:10:06.510\ncapture quality.\n\n224\n00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:07.560\nTo me, that's not bad, right?\n\n225\n00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.803\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; To think about it, it's pretty decent.\n\n226\n00:10:08.803 --> 00:10:11.032\n&gt;&gt; Maybe a little space on the captures.\n\n227\n00:10:11.032 --> 00:10:11.592\n&gt;&gt; Right!\n\n228\n00:10:11.592 --> 00:10:13.360\nYeah, not as big.\n\n229\n00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Obviously, go 100%.\n\n230\n00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:15.120\nSo you know.\n\n231\n00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.010\nA little bit bigger,\nwon't get as many, right?\n\n232\n00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:18.290\nSo applications, right?\n\n233\n00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:19.800\nWe've got that saved.\n\n234\n00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.830\nRun application,\nsave closed applications clipboard.\n\n235\n00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:25.650\nHow big do we want the clipboard\ndata capture to be?\n\n236\n00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:28.790\nIf there's limitation,\nhow many captured characters?\n\n237\n00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:30.590\nSaved documents, as we said.\n\n238\n00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:33.030\nAll kinds of files, what do we wanna do?\n\n239\n00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:37.910\nFiles record all files, files accept\nsystem files anything created by the user,\n\n240\n00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:40.420\nspecify which directories you wanna watch.\n\n241\n00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.070\nSo maybe there's a certain directory\nthat you wanna drill in on.\n\n242\n00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:47.460\nMaybe a payroll or\nreports, who knows what?\n\n243\n00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.689\nAnd you could actually go through and\nspecify that, right?\n\n244\n00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.570\nOn the computer itself,\nright start shutdown,\n\n245\n00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:58.360\ninternet based activity, save all\ninternet connections, websites visited.\n\n246\n00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:02.720\nLook at the protocol selections we have,\nnormal, secure, FTP and others,\n\n247\n00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.950\nso forgetting other stuff we're\ngoing to capture all that, right,\n\n248\n00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:10.790\nso again a lot of details here and then\nfrom a report sending standpoint, this is\n\n249\n00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:15.226\nthe part that also gets to be something\nthat could be incredibly problematic for\n\n250\n00:11:15.226 --> 00:11:17.370\nus on the defense side, great for\n\n251\n00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:20.690\nthe insider threat, the attacker,\nthe threat source, right.\n\n252\n00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:21.620\nDon't send reports.\n\n253\n00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:24.720\nSend reports via email,\nvia local network, via FTP.\n\n254\n00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.360\nWe could set them up and\nif we have an email relay, right.\n\n255\n00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:32.010\nSo we could just set up an email solution,\nprogram it in, boom we're done.\n\n256\n00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.230\nWhat kinda logs do we wanna send?\n\n257\n00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:36.430\nSending report format.\n\n258\n00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:38.200\nWhat kinda format do we want?\n\n259\n00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.520\nAnd when do we send?\n\n260\n00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.580\nWhat's the time offset for sending?\n\n261\n00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.560\nAnd how do we batch that information\nout on the system, right?\n\n262\n00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:49.390\nSo this would allow us to be able to set\nthese reports up and just essentially\n\n263\n00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:53.660\nremotely deliver them every couple\nhours as long as the thing's running.\n\n264\n00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:54.251\nYou think about that.\n\n265\n00:11:54.251 --> 00:11:57.339\nThat's, and this is again,\nthis a basic one.\n\n266\n00:11:57.339 --> 00:11:57.947\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the scary stuff.\n\n267\n00:11:57.947 --> 00:11:59.114\n&gt;&gt; That's the scary stuff.\n\n268\n00:11:59.114 --> 00:12:00.270\n&gt;&gt; And like you said, this is basic.\n\n269\n00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:04.270\nThis isn't like some amazing tool you\ncan pay super amounts of money for\n\n270\n00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:08.160\nyou've seen out in the wild\nthat's just awesomely developed.\n\n271\n00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.460\nThis is a very basic,\nvery simple interface.\n\n272\n00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:11.530\nEasy to use.\n\n273\n00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:13.012\nAnd yet also very powerful.\n\n274\n00:12:13.012 --> 00:12:14.588\n&gt;&gt; Incredible so when you think about it.\n\n275\n00:12:14.588 --> 00:12:18.386\nSo I just gonna haven't saved all the\nsettings so just you know we have a kind\n\n276\n00:12:18.386 --> 00:12:21.778\nof configure the way we want that\nwhat the little prop up was for me.\n\n277\n00:12:21.778 --> 00:12:24.658\nAnd then I have to have a turn obviously\njust turn this on, right and so,\n\n278\n00:12:24.658 --> 00:12:27.634\nI go in and I, you will click start\nmonitoring, he will do that a minute and\n\n279\n00:12:27.634 --> 00:12:30.715\ncapture some staff, now this is you\nmay have noticed here I'm registered.\n\n280\n00:12:30.715 --> 00:12:34.625\nSo, this is a demo virtual talked\nat the value demo software before.\n\n281\n00:12:34.625 --> 00:12:39.757\nYou get this you get certain number\nof demo, tried with this and or days.\n\n282\n00:12:39.757 --> 00:12:43.137\nThis one will give you a little pop-up\nthat says hey, you can register.\n\n283\n00:12:43.137 --> 00:12:45.237\nIf you don't register,\nyou run this on register.\n\n284\n00:12:45.237 --> 00:12:47.367\nYou can only collect for 40 minutes.\n\n285\n00:12:47.367 --> 00:12:48.447\nThen it will stop.\n\n286\n00:12:48.447 --> 00:12:51.227\nBut if you register it,\nit basically removes the restrictions.\n\n287\n00:12:51.227 --> 00:12:54.307\nSo if you see that, if you're playing\nwith this one and you see that pop up,\n\n288\n00:12:54.307 --> 00:12:55.767\njust you know why it's there.\n\n289\n00:12:55.767 --> 00:12:57.967\nIt's because it's\nthe unregistered version, right?\n\n290\n00:12:57.967 --> 00:12:59.450\nSo let's start this monitoring.\n\n291\n00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:00.790\nGo ahead and we'll do that.\n\n292\n00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:01.780\nYou could see it's running.\n\n293\n00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:04.290\nStop obviously will allow to stop that.\n\n294\n00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:07.630\nNow what we're gonna do,\nwe do have website open.\n\n295\n00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:11.130\nSo we'll just go in and I don't know..\n\n296\n00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:15.140\nJust click on something doesn't\nreally matter what, right.\n\n297\n00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.300\nJust click on a couple\nof different things.\n\n298\n00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:20.780\nJust get some information going here.\n\n299\n00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:21.280\nAnd.\n\n300\n00:13:24.842 --> 00:13:27.390\nBring up Google and,\njust do a couple things.\n\n301\n00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:30.850\nWe'll type something in there real quick,\njust while we're waiting for\n\n302\n00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:32.300\nthat to go out.\n\n303\n00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.640\nLet's do.\n\n304\n00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.470\nKey logger software, right?\n\n305\n00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:41.940\nOf course it would help if I click in\nthere to actually type as opposed to\n\n306\n00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:43.455\nusing the force strength to.\n\n307\n00:13:43.455 --> 00:13:44.491\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There we go,\n\n308\n00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:49.020\nits I am,I was telling you that whole\nthing about the whole key stroke thing.\n\n309\n00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:50.980\nIt's just not going through.\n\n310\n00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:51.810\nAll right, no big deal.\n\n311\n00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:53.660\nWe went ahead and we brought that up.\n\n312\n00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:54.810\nNot a problem.\n\n313\n00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:59.040\nAnd let's go ahead and let's open.\n\n314\n00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.030\nA spreadsheet will open\nup a little program here,\n\n315\n00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:03.820\njust give it a couple of\nthings to capture real quick.\n\n316\n00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:05.610\nLeave that open.\n\n317\n00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:12.517\nLet's go ahead and let's open up Notepad.\n\n318\n00:14:21.012 --> 00:14:26.248\nI would type a little\nlow item out in there\n\n319\n00:14:26.248 --> 00:14:32.250\nin this is a test for key loggers right.\n\n320\n00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:35.080\nAnd we just leave that open.\n\n321\n00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:39.620\nAnd then, let's go ahead and\nlet's do the following.\n\n322\n00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:45.050\nLet's open up the Windows Explorer.\n\n323\n00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:46.270\nLet's go over here.\n\n324\n00:14:47.505 --> 00:14:50.345\nAnd let's go to the path, and\n\n325\n00:14:50.345 --> 00:14:55.525\nyou could see already the path that\nwe're storing all of the logs in, right,\n\n326\n00:14:55.525 --> 00:14:58.755\nfor the program, just copied it when we\nwere doing the config, just so you know,\n\n327\n00:14:58.755 --> 00:15:02.035\nwe'd have it easy to just throw in in\nthere without having to type it all in.\n\n328\n00:15:02.035 --> 00:15:04.225\nAnd you could see, without me\neven going to the directory, and\n\n329\n00:15:04.225 --> 00:15:06.965\nI'll go in there in a minute,\nyou see all the data files that are there.\n\n330\n00:15:06.965 --> 00:15:09.385\nThese are all the files that are being\ncreated as I'm monitoring, right?\n\n331\n00:15:09.385 --> 00:15:13.870\nSo we could see all of that already and\nsee all the stuff that's in here\n\n332\n00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:18.660\nsome have items in them, some you can\nsee app data's there, right key data for\n\n333\n00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:21.720\nright key stroke is there,\nURL data so is on the web.\n\n334\n00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.690\nWe haven't done a screen capture yet\nbecause it goes every five minutes,\n\n335\n00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:26.720\nI didn't change that so\nwe will get a screen capture for\n\n336\n00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.280\nif we let it run long enough we'll\ncome back and take a look at it and\n\n337\n00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.770\nwe will leave it running while we do\nthe anti key logger which is part two, and\n\n338\n00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:35.070\nthen we'll come back, we'll take a look,\nwe'll see we'll have one there.\n\n339\n00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:37.689\nBut you could see that all the data\nis starting to get created and\n\n340\n00:15:37.689 --> 00:15:40.904\nstart to be captured and if we let that\nrun long enough, we'll just leave that\n\n341\n00:15:40.904 --> 00:15:43.593\nrunning and then we'll stop monitoring and\nwe'll take a look.\n\n342\n00:15:43.593 --> 00:15:45.539\nWe'll see we'll have a bunch of stuff,\nright?\n\n343\n00:15:45.539 --> 00:15:50.346\nSo now we're showing you how an insider\npotentially an insider threat goes in and\n\n344\n00:15:50.346 --> 00:15:53.271\nstarts to scrape information\nout of the system.\n\n345\n00:15:53.271 --> 00:15:57.360\nLet 's show you how we defend against\nthat because obviously as an incident\n\n346\n00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.135\nresponder.\n\n347\n00:15:58.135 --> 00:16:00.854\nAs an incident manager,\nas a security professional,\n\n348\n00:16:00.854 --> 00:16:05.045\nit's not enough just to say hey, by the\nway, you may or may not have this running,\n\n349\n00:16:05.045 --> 00:16:07.970\nbut let's put proactive thought\nprocesses to bear here.\n\n350\n00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:11.870\nLet's put some software in place, that if\nwe tried to install something like this\n\n351\n00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:15.260\nwould hopefully pick it up and prevent\nthis from happening in the first place.\n\n352\n00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:21.280\nSo we call those anti-keylogger software\nor some sort of derivative of that.\n\n353\n00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.560\nI'm gonna show you what\none of these may be.\n\n354\n00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:24.420\nLet's leave this up.\n\n355\n00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:25.890\nWe'll just minimize it so\nwe'll have it here but\n\n356\n00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:29.160\nwe'll minimize it down to\nthe taskbar here so we can see it.\n\n357\n00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.270\nCan we go back full-screen\ncuz I need to be able to see.\n\n358\n00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:32.280\nNope, back to my machine.\n\n359\n00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.410\nYeah, there we go, thank you.\n\n360\n00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:36.490\nAnd you'll be able to see the corner\nthere to be able to get to the next item.\n\n361\n00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:40.145\nSo, I'm gonna start this program\nover here called SpyShelter Premium.\n\n362\n00:16:40.145 --> 00:16:41.275\nI've already got it running.\n\n363\n00:16:41.275 --> 00:16:45.395\nWhen I say start what I mean is,\nI've launched it, but I've disabled it so\n\n364\n00:16:45.395 --> 00:16:47.665\nthat it doesn't pick up on\nthe keylogger already being there.\n\n365\n00:16:47.665 --> 00:16:50.635\nPrevent it so we could do part\none that we're just showing you.\n\n366\n00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:52.095\nNow I'm gonna go in,\nI'm gonna bring it up.\n\n367\n00:16:52.095 --> 00:16:54.865\nAnd I'm gonna show you what it does,\nand we'll take a look at that piece.\n\n368\n00:16:54.865 --> 00:16:57.565\nSo we're gonna go in here,\njust come down to the CIS tray.\n\n369\n00:16:57.565 --> 00:16:59.503\nWe'll see we have it running right here.\n\n370\n00:16:59.503 --> 00:17:03.040\nI'm gonna right-click on it,\njust go ahead and open it up.\n\n371\n00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.390\nAnd that will bring up the interface for\nus.\n\n372\n00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:08.750\nAnd scroll up, there we go.\n\n373\n00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:13.420\nAnd so you can see here\nSpyShelter Anti-Keyloggers.\n\n374\n00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:16.300\nThis is the other side of the mirror.\n\n375\n00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:19.870\nThis is the part you would run,\nhopefully install proactively\n\n376\n00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:22.510\nto prevent keyloggers from being\nput there in the first place.\n\n377\n00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:25.060\nThis is like anti-malware,\nanti-virus software.\n\n378\n00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.480\nYou should be running it on all\nyour systems automatically.\n\n379\n00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:31.230\nSo that way if somebody does try to infect\nyou, you've got a leg up on them and\n\n380\n00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:35.030\nhopefully your defense will absorb\nthis and prevent it from happening.\n\n381\n00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:36.940\nYou'll see it's been disabled.\n\n382\n00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:38.730\nSo I can obviously turn this on.\n\n383\n00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:41.310\nAnd when I do,\nwhat does it find immediately.\n\n384\n00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:43.230\nLook at that,\nimmediately comes up and says,\n\n385\n00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:45.570\nhey, there's something\nrunning in the system.\n\n386\n00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:47.490\nThat doesn't look like it belongs there.\n\n387\n00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:48.550\nWhat's going on with that.\n\n388\n00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:52.920\nNow it's nice that it does give me\nthe option to say no, no, that's okay.\n\n389\n00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.700\nWe should have that key log running there.\n\n390\n00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:56.060\nLet's go ahead and allow that.\n\n391\n00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:59.340\nI could deny it,\nI could terminate with extreme prejudice.\n\n392\n00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.030\n&gt;&gt; That's the Arnold key right there.\n\n393\n00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:03.350\n&gt;&gt; Have you seen those new commercials\nhe's been doing recently for\n\n394\n00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:07.470\nthe gaming thing with the-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the war stuff, yeah.\n\n395\n00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:08.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, mobile strike, yeah.\n\n396\n00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:09.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's it, mobile strike.\n\n397\n00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:12.675\nIt's amazing what happens after\nyou're the Governor of California.\n\n398\n00:18:12.675 --> 00:18:13.925\nit's just all down hill from there.\n\n399\n00:18:13.925 --> 00:18:15.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Mobile strike commercials.\n\n400\n00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you're stuck doing Mobile Strike\ncommercials that's where you are.\n\n401\n00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:20.760\nSo you could see that it\npicks this up right away.\n\n402\n00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:25.460\nSo even if I had managed to get\nthis installed, it's right there.\n\n403\n00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:29.270\nI mean just the minute I turn down\nthe protection now, had I had this running\n\n404\n00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:32.190\nbefore I even installed the key logger it\nwould have come up before configure and\n\n405\n00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:33.560\nstarted it working.\n\n406\n00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:35.040\nSo yeah, we just wanna know that.\n\n407\n00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.250\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n408\n00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:41.910\nI'm gonna click allow just to\nmake sure that this is allowed.\n\n409\n00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:43.720\nYou could see it's picking up on this.\n\n410\n00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:47.732\nIt's really picking up on.\n\n411\n00:18:47.732 --> 00:18:48.474\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n412\n00:18:48.474 --> 00:18:50.640\n&gt;&gt; Now I'm just gonna allow it,\njust so it lets it run so\n\n413\n00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.330\nwe can get the screen capture\nstuff in the background.\n\n414\n00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:54.380\nBut I just wanted to show you\nsome of the settings here,\n\n415\n00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:56.010\njust on the anti key logger site.\n\n416\n00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:59.900\nWe have a sense cuz If I turn it off, then\nI can't start enabling all the features.\n\n417\n00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.910\nBut you'll see,\nit's a very simple interface,\n\n418\n00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:03.416\nturn on and off little slider there.\n\n419\n00:19:03.416 --> 00:19:09.200\nAnti-keylogger, clipboard protection,\nanti-get text, so don't let it grab text,\n\n420\n00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:14.410\nsystem protection, keystroke encryption,\nanti-kernel road keylogge.\n\n421\n00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:17.820\nSo it's got all the protections here,\nright, including sound.\n\n422\n00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:22.810\nCuz we have keyloggers that actually will\ndo sound recording, believe it or not.\n\n423\n00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:24.510\nSo, they'll turn on the microphone.\n\n424\n00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:25.720\nWe have ones that will turn on the webcam.\n\n425\n00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.470\nYou can see it right there as well.\n\n426\n00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:30.680\nAnd they will capture not\njust your screen captures but\n\n427\n00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.290\nthey will take pictures of the webcam,\nof the surrounding area.\n\n428\n00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:34.910\nThey'll record the audio.\n\n429\n00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:40.820\nAs I've said, some of the more advanced\nones are incredibly, incredibly technical\n\n430\n00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:45.580\nand this is why we don't allow you to\nbring mobile electronics in unregulated,\n\n431\n00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:49.860\nunsecure, unmanaged electronics into\nsecure environments like military bases,\n\n432\n00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.020\ncertain government offices.\n\n433\n00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:55.210\nBecause if you have this kind of software\nrunning on it, not the anti key logger,\n\n434\n00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:57.920\nbut the key logger that\nwould do this kinda stuff,\n\n435\n00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:01.810\nthey could turn those devices into\nrecording microphones and video cameras.\n\n436\n00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:05.180\nAnd they could see everything going on\naround you without you even realizing it.\n\n437\n00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:08.240\nHow many of us put our cell\nphone down on the table and\n\n438\n00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.240\nprobably don't think about it at all,\n\n439\n00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:16.080\nabout the fact that the microphone video\ncamera, cuz every device has them today.\n\n440\n00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:18.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Can be turned on or remote controlled.\n\n441\n00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.080\nHow many people think about that.\n\n442\n00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.900\nI don't think most people do.\n\n443\n00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:24.830\nSo you have protection for\nall this kind of stuff, as you can see.\n\n444\n00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:28.110\nWe could set up rules here that\nwill allow us, as you can see,\n\n445\n00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:30.130\nI allowed connectivity\nfrom these programs.\n\n446\n00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:33.800\nSo it starts populating saying\nokay we'll allow that to run.\n\n447\n00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.750\nBut kind of like a firewall interface,\nlet's set the rules up, allow,\n\n448\n00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:39.621\ndeny, move them up and\ndown, standard interface.\n\n449\n00:20:39.621 --> 00:20:41.230\nPretty straightforward.\n\n450\n00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:43.230\nYou can see any one of\nthese rules if I go in and\n\n451\n00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:45.070\nI just tag an edit on it real quick.\n\n452\n00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:49.030\nAnd you can see all of the detail\nof what this rule does.\n\n453\n00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:50.550\nAllow this to take place.\n\n454\n00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:53.150\nSo in this case, it's screenshotting.\n\n455\n00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:55.670\nAllow it to take place but\nyou'll see allow, deny, default.\n\n456\n00:20:55.670 --> 00:21:00.310\nPretty simple interface but\nyou could see all of the 20 some odd,\n\n457\n00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:02.880\n25 some odd things we're looking at here.\n\n458\n00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:06.970\nAccess to system debug,\nphysical memory access, reading memory of\n\n459\n00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:11.330\nprotected processes, modified\nprotected files, clipboard monitoring.\n\n460\n00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:14.092\nI mean, you look at this stuff,\nthis is incredibly detailed.\n\n461\n00:21:14.092 --> 00:21:19.460\nAnd so\nsoftware like this is gonna allow us\n\n462\n00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:23.820\nto create some pretty in-depth monitoring\nrules around what does and doesn't happen.\n\n463\n00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.780\nHere's my log window\ntelling me what's going on.\n\n464\n00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:30.410\nSo the anti-keylogger log that\nshows me essentially what\n\n465\n00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:32.960\nthe anti-keylogger is able to do.\n\n466\n00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:36.460\nI'm taking a look at all this,\nand I can see any one of these.\n\n467\n00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:37.940\nI can view the log file.\n\n468\n00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.060\nYes, I can go in.\n\n469\n00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:42.720\nIt's just central text file no big deal,\nbut I can go in and see it.\n\n470\n00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.150\nIf I want to clear the log,\nI have the option to do that.\n\n471\n00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:47.000\nWhat apps are restricted.\n\n472\n00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.350\nSo I can run apps in here if I want to,\nor restrict them.\n\n473\n00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:56.330\nAnd I would be able to then\npopulate this keystroke encryption.\n\n474\n00:21:56.330 --> 00:22:01.070\nI can go in and specify that keystrokes\nwhether will not be encrypted and\n\n475\n00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:04.160\nallow encryption to take place\nin other words on keystroking.\n\n476\n00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:09.070\nSo I can protect certain keystrokes\neven if a key logger manager is to run.\n\n477\n00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:13.270\nWon't be able to see anything that the\nkeystrokes will automatically be encrypted\n\n478\n00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:16.420\nwhich if you think about it is\nan extra added layer of protection.\n\n479\n00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:18.800\nThat is incredibly valuable.\n\n480\n00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.460\nBecause if I encrypt\nkeystrokes of all processes,\n\n481\n00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:26.000\neven if the key logger somehow gets\nunder this and manages to run,\n\n482\n00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.870\nall it's gonna get is garbled stuff\nbecause the keystrokes will be encrypted.\n\n483\n00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:31.619\nWon't be able to read them,\nwon't know what they are.\n\n484\n00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.580\nThat's obviously going to\nbe very valuable for us.\n\n485\n00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.130\nAnd we have the ability to go in and\n\n486\n00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:40.272\ndrill down with a little\nbit more advanced settings.\n\n487\n00:22:40.272 --> 00:22:43.040\nWe're gonna enable support for\nforeign languages, things like that.\n\n488\n00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:46.270\nAnd we have some settings on\nthe system here, as well.\n\n489\n00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:48.690\nWhat language are we running by default.\n\n490\n00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:52.270\nYou'll add restricted runs, check for\nupdates, you know things like that,\n\n491\n00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:53.530\ngeneral stuff.\n\n492\n00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:57.810\nAnd when we're running this kind\nof software we're able to control\n\n493\n00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:01.750\nwhat the key logger does and\nobviously how that is happening.\n\n494\n00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:04.330\nLet's go in and\ntake a look here at the logs.\n\n495\n00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:07.420\nWe do have screen shot data on us,\nwe have at least one picture there.\n\n496\n00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:09.560\nAs you can see there is\na one kilobyte item, so\n\n497\n00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.410\nit looks like we do have some data.\n\n498\n00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:14.960\nWe're probably done at least one screen\nshot since we started running this.\n\n499\n00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:20.530\nAnd so if we go in and\ncome back here, bring this back up.\n\n500\n00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:23.200\nAnd let's just go ahead,\nlet's stop monitoring.\n\n501\n00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.870\nWe've been running it for\nseveral minutes now.\n\n502\n00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:31.855\nAnd then if we wanna go ahead and\nwe wanna go to our internet activity area,\n\n503\n00:23:31.855 --> 00:23:35.490\nwebsites visited will see\nwhat website were visited.\n\n504\n00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:37.500\nYou could see what was collected here.\n\n505\n00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:41.169\nIn the tool, I went to google and\nfrom google I didn't do anything but\n\n506\n00:23:41.169 --> 00:23:42.518\nyou can see I went there.\n\n507\n00:23:42.518 --> 00:23:43.750\nIt gives me the URL.\n\n508\n00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:47.110\nShows me down here by the way\nwhat the user name is.\n\n509\n00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:49.609\nShows me the website I went to for\nevery entry.\n\n510\n00:23:49.609 --> 00:23:51.906\nYou can see each one that I went to.\n\n511\n00:23:51.906 --> 00:23:54.745\nThe one about snow in Hawaii,\nyou could see that one.\n\n512\n00:23:54.745 --> 00:23:57.379\nGives me the URL,\nit gives me day and time stamp.\n\n513\n00:23:57.379 --> 00:24:00.697\nShows me what that is When I come in here,\nand I go,\n\n514\n00:24:00.697 --> 00:24:03.309\nI can see just on the general tabs here.\n\n515\n00:24:03.309 --> 00:24:04.980\nIf I just go through the general stuff.\n\n516\n00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:06.520\nI see all the key strokes.\n\n517\n00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:11.860\nSo, I went in, right, looks like I went\nthere and I did a control and enter.\n\n518\n00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:14.020\nFor notepad,\nshows me the key strokes there.\n\n519\n00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:18.150\nShows me what I did in notepad.\n\n520\n00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.340\nStart menu shows me what I did there, so\n\n521\n00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:23.970\nthose are all the key strokes\nthat I was engaging in.\n\n522\n00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:25.750\nGot two screenshots, right?\n\n523\n00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:27.630\nEach one right there\nshows me what they are.\n\n524\n00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:30.900\nIt tells me the list of\napplications that were run.\n\n525\n00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.780\nSo, I could see all that, right?\n\n526\n00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:35.360\nIf there was any clipboard information,\nor anything like that,\n\n527\n00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.460\nI would capture that as well.\n\n528\n00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:38.880\nI could go in.\n\n529\n00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.160\nTake a look here, right?\n\n530\n00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.570\nFigure out what data I want,\n\n531\n00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:46.310\nkinda show me everything in a report,\ncreate one page report, multi-page report,\n\n532\n00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:50.220\njust kinda figure out how I wanna\nsee it in HTML, etc, right?\n\n533\n00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:52.440\nCreate reports, so just let that go ahead.\n\n534\n00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:55.930\nWe'll throw that up on the desktop here\nreal quick just to take a look at it.\n\n535\n00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:58.270\nAll right, so yep,\nlet's take a look at that.\n\n536\n00:24:58.270 --> 00:24:59.750\nLet's view that.\n\n537\n00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:03.190\nSo, let's allow that.\n\n538\n00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:05.410\nRight.\nAnd then there's my key logger report\n\n539\n00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:06.520\nright there.\n\n540\n00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:09.520\nShows me all the detailed entries and\n\n541\n00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:12.310\ninformation along with screen captures\n&gt;&gt; Screenshots\n\n542\n00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:15.110\n&gt;&gt; Invented that I can go to look at.\n\n543\n00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:17.660\nI could just click on it,\nthere's my screen capture right there.\n\n544\n00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:19.950\nSo, I can just go pull it up and\ninteract with it.\n\n545\n00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:21.510\nYou can see the URL location,\n\n546\n00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:25.410\nthe address is local to the machine and\nthe C users directory.\n\n547\n00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:26.460\nI'm Sally.\nToday by the way,\n\n548\n00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:27.990\nit's my alter ego for today.\n\n549\n00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:30.900\nRight, so I'm feeling a little bright and\nbubbly so\n\n550\n00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:32.490\nI thought I'd be a Sally this morning.\n\n551\n00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:34.950\nAnd so, you could see here,\nright, that I could zoom in,\n\n552\n00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:36.770\nI could see whatever's going on.\n\n553\n00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:40.820\nI just got the basic capture of the\ndesktop because remember, I didn't have,\n\n554\n00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:43.310\nprobably I didn't have anything up at\nthe time that I was running it, so\n\n555\n00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:45.130\nas a result,\nthat’s just what we're seeing.\n\n556\n00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:50.760\nSo, I could see all of this and\nit gives me detailed information here, and\n\n557\n00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:55.720\nwhen you look at what we're getting this\ncould a treasure trove of information for\n\n558\n00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:58.590\na bad actor when you think about it,\nright.\n\n559\n00:25:58.590 --> 00:25:59.730\nI mean, this is good stuff.\n\n560\n00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:01.990\nSo, this is pretty cool.\n\n561\n00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:03.290\nIt gives me the URLs.\n\n562\n00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:07.860\n&gt;&gt; It should give you the heebie jeebies,\nthe I feel paranoid now.\n\n563\n00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.970\nBecause this is a pretty detailed report.\n\n564\n00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:14.350\nThe information that can be gathered\nthrough something as a simple key logger\n\n565\n00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:17.350\ncan be very exposing, as it were.\n\n566\n00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:21.610\n&gt;&gt; And remember, we decided hey, don't\n&gt;&gt; Exfiltrate these reports,\n\n567\n00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:24.310\njust leave them on the local machine,\nwe'll come pick them up, right?\n\n568\n00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:26.250\nBut we offer delivery service, right?\n\n569\n00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:28.280\nWe'll send them to you, free of charge.\n\n570\n00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:32.650\nI mean, this software will ship these\nreports out every so many minutes.\n\n571\n00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:37.680\nAnd again, who's gonna look for this\nkind of traffic in the network stream?\n\n572\n00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:38.250\nHighly unlikely.\n\n573\n00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:41.020\nYou'll find this kind of traffic goes\nout as a text file, basically, or\n\n574\n00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:42.690\nin this case in HTML file.\n\n575\n00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:45.320\nI said HTML,\nwe can easily do this as a text file.\n\n576\n00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.300\nHow many text files are on\nthe average machine?\n\n577\n00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.580\nYou're gonna find one more and notice it?\n\n578\n00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:52.240\nAnd is it gonna be of any interest\nto you compared to all the others?\n\n579\n00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.870\nProbably not.\nRight, when you think about it.\n\n580\n00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:55.780\nSo, when you look at this kind of stuff.\n\n581\n00:26:55.780 --> 00:27:00.310\nThis is the pro con if you will but\nprobably more likely be the light and\n\n582\n00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:03.460\nthe dark side of this arguing\nabout insider threats.\n\n583\n00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:04.815\nThis is one example.\n\n584\n00:27:04.815 --> 00:27:07.145\nOf how an insider threat\ncould be propagated, but\n\n585\n00:27:07.145 --> 00:27:10.795\nalso an example of how we defend against\nthat same insider threat, right?\n\n586\n00:27:10.795 --> 00:27:13.535\nBecause for every potential attack vector,\n\n587\n00:27:13.535 --> 00:27:17.275\nwe as incident responders have to\ncome up with a way to counter that.\n\n588\n00:27:17.275 --> 00:27:20.540\nAnd if we can counter it proactively,\nBetter for us.\n\n589\n00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:23.920\nAnd you can see that we offered\nan option to counter this proactively.\n\n590\n00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:29.260\nBut even if that option had, for some\nreason, been bypassed or somehow modified,\n\n591\n00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:32.470\nwe showed you that the simple application\nof encryption of the keystrokes\n\n592\n00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:36.010\nin the anti key logger would potentially\nprevent a lot of this from happening.\n\n593\n00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:36.610\nNot all of it.\n\n594\n00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:39.110\nWe'd still be screen capturing,\nthat wouldn't be stopped.\n\n595\n00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:41.750\nBut the keystroke capture,\nthe URL capture,\n\n596\n00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:43.900\nall that stuff would\nprobably not have happened.\n\n597\n00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:46.100\nNow, Adam, do employers have the right.\n\n598\n00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.420\nWe got a question coming\nout of the chat room.\n\n599\n00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:49.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Asking about the legalities of this for\n\n600\n00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:53.900\nan employer to put keylogging\nsoftware on their client machines.\n\n601\n00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:57.270\nWould all they have to do is put that\nin the acceptable use policy and say,\n\n602\n00:27:57.270 --> 00:27:58.880\nwe're gonna be monitoring.\n\n603\n00:27:58.880 --> 00:27:59.660\nBuyer beware.\n\n604\n00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:02.010\nOr just beware we're gonna be doing it.\n\n605\n00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:06.050\n&gt;&gt; So, the answer is absolutely not\nnecessarily in the acceptable use policy.\n\n606\n00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:09.760\nWhere you would probably see this\nwould be in a user handbook or\n\n607\n00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:11.530\nin an employee handbook.\n\n608\n00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:18.270\nYou would see it in, perhaps there may be\na disclaimer as you log on to the machine\n\n609\n00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:22.430\nas there is in many organizations\nthat says corporate property.\n\n610\n00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:25.780\nAnything done on here is subject to\nmonitoring as a general disclaimer.\n\n611\n00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:28.300\nYou won't go into detail and\nsay we run this kind of software.\n\n612\n00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:31.540\nBut, in general,\nany activity on this machine or\n\n613\n00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:34.230\non a corporate asset is\nsubject to monitoring.\n\n614\n00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:37.590\nAnd that is a broad statement that\ncovers this kind of activity.\n\n615\n00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:42.680\nSo, the answer is yes, it is certainly\nlegal in the sense that is allowable as\n\n616\n00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:47.850\nlong as the company has gone through the\nmotions of making it clear to anybody who\n\n617\n00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:53.000\nuses that system that they're subject to\nmonitoring and then that's perfectly fine.\n\n618\n00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.680\nBut as we said in our prior\ndiscussion in the other episode\n\n619\n00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:00.000\nwhere I went through this exact\nconversation and stressed this.\n\n620\n00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.610\nIt is up to the employee to\nunderstand their requirements and\n\n621\n00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:08.040\ntheir responsibilities as they\noperate the corporate asset.\n\n622\n00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:12.070\nIt is up to the employer to make\nthose clear and to be unequivocal.\n\n623\n00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:17.200\nSo there is an expectation that\nthe employer must say, we are monitoring.\n\n624\n00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:22.110\nThere is an expectation then that\nthe employer will inform all employees and\n\n625\n00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:26.230\nthat those employees must sign off and\nacknowledge understanding of and\n\n626\n00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:29.065\nhaving being told that that\nexpectation is in place.\n\n627\n00:29:29.065 --> 00:29:34.220\nAnd then, at that point,we are allowed\nas an employer to do this,the employee.\n\n628\n00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:34.910\nCan't turn around and\n\n629\n00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:38.850\nsay to us, by the way, you should have no\nrecord of that stuff, that's personal.\n\n630\n00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:42.090\nWell, you shouldn't have done that on a\ncorporate asset, because you knew we were\n\n631\n00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:45.300\nmonitoring, and that would be pretty\nmuch the extent of the conversation.\n\n632\n00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:49.060\nSo, yeah, absolutely we can do this, but\nwe have to have a clear non-equivocal\n\n633\n00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:52.760\nin policy, and we have to make sure that\nthat is applied to everybody equally.\n\n634\n00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:57.370\nThere can be no favoritism or exceptions\ncarved out to that kind of a rule.\n\n635\n00:29:57.370 --> 00:30:00.210\nUnless, and I did go through this\n\n636\n00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:04.960\nparticular scenario in the last\nepisode on our conversation as well.\n\n637\n00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:08.810\nThere are exceptions to every rule, so\nwe can carve out machines and areas and\n\n638\n00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:11.930\nusers that may not be subject to\nmonitoring under certain conditions for\n\n639\n00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:13.200\ncertain reasons.\n\n640\n00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:18.250\nAnd as a result of that we could\nspecify those in a Addendum,\n\n641\n00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:23.100\nor some sort of follow-on to the policy\nas an acknowledged exception, and we\n\n642\n00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:27.830\ncan measure and monitor and manage against\nthose but we have to document them.\n\n643\n00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:30.770\nWe can't just verbally agree to the fact,\nbetween Daniel and\n\n644\n00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:33.880\nI, that we're not going to monitor\nDaniel's machine and that'll be okay.\n\n645\n00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:37.900\nWe gotta put it in writing,\nsign off on it, have a record of it so\n\n646\n00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:41.430\nthat if anyone ever comes and\nwants to check that We have auditability,\n\n647\n00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:45.380\ntraceability, transaction verification and\nvalidation and we know why.\n\n648\n00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:46.870\nAnd if we do those things and\n\n649\n00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:50.940\nyes it is perfectly acceptable\nto do this kind of stuff.\n\n650\n00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:54.150\nBut if we don't follow those\nrules then we have a problem.\n\n651\n00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:56.480\nRight?\nThis may not be acceptable behavior.\n\n652\n00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:59.850\nWell, it looks like I'm going to go to the\nInternet as soon as I possibly can, and\n\n653\n00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:02.727\ndownload an anti-keylogger program and\ninstall it on my computer,\n\n654\n00:31:02.727 --> 00:31:05.225\nespecially since Adam's here\nin the studio so [CROSSTALK].\n\n655\n00:31:05.225 --> 00:31:07.940\n&gt;&gt; You never know,\nremember that phone drive I gave ya.\n\n656\n00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:09.540\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nhe did give me a phone drive.\n\n657\n00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:10.580\n&gt;&gt; There you go right there.\n\n658\n00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:13.125\n&gt;&gt; I'm completely compromised.\n\n659\n00:31:13.125 --> 00:31:17.230\n[LAUGH] Adam, thanks for showing us\nkeyloggers, very cool stuff Very scary\n\n660\n00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:21.950\nstuff, but it's something we need to\nknow about, have a working knowledge of.\n\n661\n00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:25.170\nAnd how to counteract someone\nthat might be using something\n\n662\n00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:26.610\nas a threat against our networks.\n\n663\n00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:29.940\nThat being said, I'm looking at the clock,\nwe have run out of time for this episode.\n\n664\n00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:33.380\nThanks so much for joining us, Adam, and\nthank you guys so much for watching.\n\n665\n00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:38.080\nBut it's time to sign off, for ITPRO.TV\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie,\n\n666\n00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:40.990\nI'm a stealthy keylogger coming\nsoon to a machine near you.\n\n667\n00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:42.760\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n668\n00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:45.324\n&gt;&gt;

series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.480\nWe're jumping back in\nthe hopper with that.\n\n9\n00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.670\nAnd joining us in the hopper,\nour good friend and\n\n10\n00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.420\nour guiding star, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.170\nAdam, welcome back, sir.\n\n12\n00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.910\nHow's it going?\n\n13\n00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:30.790\n&gt;&gt; In the hopper?\n\n14\n00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:31.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Like Anthony Hopper?\n\n15\n00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.460\n&gt;&gt; Anthony Hopper.\n\n16\n00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.241\n&gt;&gt; Or a TV hopper?.\n\n17\n00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:34.171\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n18\n00:00:34.171 --> 00:00:35.316\n&gt;&gt; Or a popcorn hopper?\n\n19\n00:00:35.316 --> 00:00:35.817\nI am good.\n\n20\n00:00:35.817 --> 00:00:36.318\nI am good.\n\n21\n00:00:36.318 --> 00:00:38.330\nHopefully, you guys are as well.\n\n22\n00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.540\nWe're gonna talk a little bit\nmore about incident handling.\n\n23\n00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.130\nSpecifically, thought we'd spend some\ntime talking about forensics and\n\n24\n00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.810\nincident handling.\n\n25\n00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.480\nAnd how the two, forensic analysis and\nincident handling, kinda go hand in hand.\n\n26\n00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.170\nWe've talked in some other\nepisodes prior to this\n\n27\n00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.950\nabout the concepts of forensic analysis.\n\n28\n00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.850\nHow we manage incident response from\na forensically sound standpoint.\n\n29\n00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.560\nWhat do we need to do to safeguard data?\n\n30\n00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.940\nHow do we address those\nconcerns when we show up and\n\n31\n00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.080\ndeal with a potential crime scene or\nan incident scene?\n\n32\n00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.610\nAnd what are we gonna do to safeguard\nall the stuff that may go on there?\n\n33\n00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:10.600\nGotta think about all that.\n\n34\n00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.670\nI thought we dig a little bit deeper into\nsome of that today or at least right now.\n\n35\n00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.350\nTalk a bit about that.\n\n36\n00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.560\nWhen we think about computer forensics or\ngenerally just forensics overall,\n\n37\n00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.800\nwe're thinking about a science that is\nreally focused on or a discipline that is\n\n38\n00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.210\nfocused on looking at the ability to be\nable to gather evidence in a sound manner,\n\n39\n00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.070\nand then safeguard that evidence through\na series of meticulously planned, thought\n\n40\n00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.410\nout, and executed steps that establish\nwhat we refer to us chain of custody.\n\n41\n00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.550\nWe understand the concept as being,\n\n42\n00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.150\ndo we have knowledge of\nthe state of that evidence.\n\n43\n00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.970\nEvidence being whatever we've gathered\nfrom the particular target environment\n\n44\n00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.060\nthat we're examining.\n\n45\n00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.180\nDo we understand the state of that\nevidence at every moment in time?\n\n46\n00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.770\nFrom the time we come upon it and we first\nexamine it, document its current state,\n\n47\n00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.550\ncapture it in some way that allows us to\nsafeguard that state and understand it.\n\n48\n00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.080\nAnd then, store it and work with it,\n\n49\n00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.640\npotentially, through\nthe end of that life cycle.\n\n50\n00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.060\nWhether it is showing up at trial.\n\n51\n00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.700\nWhether it is to create an analysis and\nthen report on it,\n\n52\n00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.180\nand perhaps, at that point, give it back\nif we find there's no longer any value.\n\n53\n00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.030\nOr to destroy it, depending on what\nhappens at the end of that ultimate chain.\n\n54\n00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.500\nBut throughout that entire time from\ndiscovery through acquisition through\n\n55\n00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.900\nanalysis, through storage, however long\nthat takes out through the end of that,\n\n56\n00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.490\nto establish a forensically sound\nhandling pattern and set of\n\n57\n00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.540\nactivities in an environment that allow us\nto account for the state of that evidence.\n\n58\n00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.750\nEvery moment in time, unequivocally,\nwithout any failures or\n\n59\n00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.220\ngaps is what we talk about with regards\nto the chain of custody of evidence.\n\n60\n00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.640\nAnd so, thinking about that combing\nelements of law and computer science to\n\n61\n00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.870\ncollect and analyze data from one or more\nsystems, networks, wireless communication,\n\n62\n00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.570\nenvironments, whatever the case maybe,\nstorage devices, things of that nature.\n\n63\n00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.360\nIn a way that's admissible as\nevidence in a court of law\n\n64\n00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.350\nis really what computer\nforensics focuses on.\n\n65\n00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.150\nIt's what we think about,\nit's what we define it as.\n\n66\n00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.610\nThere's a methodology associated with\nforensics as I was saying and suggesting,\n\n67\n00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.770\nand at a high level, that methodology\nis made up of five key steps.\n\n68\n00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.030\nWanna know what they are?\n\n69\n00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.740\nObviously, important for you as a security\nprofessional, as an IT administrator,\n\n70\n00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.330\nas a potential incident handler,\nto have understanding of this.\n\n71\n00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.870\nIt's important for you in the real world\nto understand what the methodology is so\n\n72\n00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.340\nyou can execute it properly.\n\n73\n00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.080\nSupport and understand also that if you're\nasked questions about this hypothetically\n\n74\n00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.340\nat some point, you would want to be\nable to answer them authoritatively.\n\n75\n00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.810\nIt's also important to understand\nthat you need to be trained\n\n76\n00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.310\nto do this properly, right?\n\n77\n00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.930\nThis is something I can't\nstress enough to you.\n\n78\n00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.020\nThis is not the kind of thing,\nthis being forensic analysis.\n\n79\n00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.830\nThis is not the kind of thing that\nyou just read a book on and go, yeah,\n\n80\n00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.410\nI could do that, right, no problem.\n\n81\n00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.390\nI watched the YouTube video, no big deal.\n\n82\n00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.560\nI can go ahead, I could do that and\nI will be fine, right?\n\n83\n00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.150\nI mean, you could in theory.\n\n84\n00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.700\nI'm not suggesting that you\ncouldn't acquire the skills.\n\n85\n00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.120\nWhat I'm suggesting is that having the\nskills is different from understanding how\n\n86\n00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.380\nto execute those skills in\na forensically sound way.\n\n87\n00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.190\nWe could teach you easily how to\nacquire data from a hard drive.\n\n88\n00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.080\nAnd to do so in a way that would\nallow you to capture that data, but\n\n89\n00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.900\ndoing so using the proper forensics tools.\n\n90\n00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.510\nA right blocker, for instance.\n\n91\n00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.110\nA device that allows data to be pulled\nout of a system going one way, but\n\n92\n00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.620\ndoesn't allow bidirectional communication\ncoming back in to the target drive, or,\n\n93\n00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.110\nexcuse me, to the source drive.\n\n94\n00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.990\nSo, that way, we're not able to disrupt or\nin any way add or modify the data that\n\n95\n00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.940\nis there guaranteeing the integrity\nof that data in the current state and\n\n96\n00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.520\nat the moment we capture it.\n\n97\n00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.520\nThat is something you need\nto be trained to do and\n\n98\n00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.230\nbe trained to understand\nhow to do properly.\n\n99\n00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.200\nThe lack of a use of right blockers\nindicates that that drive data, or\n\n100\n00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.640\nwhatever data you capture,\nis not forensically sound,\n\n101\n00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.140\ncannot be used as evidence.\n\n102\n00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.320\nAnd Without using a write blocker, you\nwill destroy any possibility of gathering\n\n103\n00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.540\nany evidence from that system because the\nevidence will be seen as being tainted.\n\n104\n00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.920\nNo matter what you do at that point,\nyou've probably modified timestamps,\n\n105\n00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.140\nsystem status, system data, etcetera.\n\n106\n00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.400\nAnd now, you've essentially wiped out\nany opportunity for us to be able\n\n107\n00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.650\nto use the data that we may find there to\nbe able to establish cause and effect and\n\n108\n00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.100\nto do so\nin a way that is beyond reproach, and\n\n109\n00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.635\nleads to the opportunity to present\nthat data to make definitive and\n\n110\n00:05:28.635 --> 00:05:30.605\ndeclarative statements about what may or\nmay not have happened.\n\n111\n00:05:30.605 --> 00:05:35.785\nAnd draw conclusions that can be presented\nin a court of law, in a court of inquiry,\n\n112\n00:05:35.785 --> 00:05:39.005\nbefore a panel of people that may\nwanna understand more about it,\n\n113\n00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:40.707\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n114\n00:05:40.707 --> 00:05:44.917\nAnd so, we have to understand that\nthe methodology involved is very,\n\n115\n00:05:44.917 --> 00:05:49.337\nvery important for practitioners but\ntraining to become and\n\n116\n00:05:49.337 --> 00:05:53.067\nto understand how to become a forensics\nexpert, to understand how to do this\n\n117\n00:05:53.067 --> 00:05:56.057\nproperly, is critical for\nyour ability to do this successfully.\n\n118\n00:05:56.057 --> 00:05:58.827\nSo, the methodology, five steps,\nimportant to know them.\n\n119\n00:05:58.827 --> 00:05:59.457\nKnow them in order.\n\n120\n00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:06.290\nPreservation, identification, extraction,\ninterpretation, and documentation.\n\n121\n00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.940\nSo, making sure we understand\nthe preservation of the crime scene,\n\n122\n00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.710\nof the evidence of whatever it may be,\nthe incident involved.\n\n123\n00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.228\nIdentification of all the items that\nhave to be ultimately gathered from,\n\n124\n00:06:17.228 --> 00:06:19.100\nanalyzed, and documented.\n\n125\n00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.700\nExtraction, the ability to pull data,\npull evidence out of one or\n\n126\n00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.820\nmore of those systems, but\nagain in a forensically sound way.\n\n127\n00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.850\nInterpretation is essentially\nanalysis of the extracted data.\n\n128\n00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.260\nAnd then documentation is reporting,\nright?\n\n129\n00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.566\nBeing able to write up what we found,\ndo so in an audience-friendly,\n\n130\n00:06:35.566 --> 00:06:39.770\naudience-relevant and appropriate manner,\nand communicate broadly and widely.\n\n131\n00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.930\nTo whoever may need to see that in\na way that makes sense for them, and\n\n132\n00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:48.610\nreproduce information about the incident,\nthat we can then draw conclusions from.\n\n133\n00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.600\nHaving done all that,\nwe've met the five criteria.\n\n134\n00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.880\nThe five key checkpoints or milestones\nthat we have to execute on in order to say\n\n135\n00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.630\nthat we've done things and executed things\nin a way that is forensically sound.\n\n136\n00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.630\nSo, we do want to make sure we're\naware of that and understand that.\n\n137\n00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.080\nAlso the main objectives regards\nto computer for instance, right?\n\n138\n00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.320\nSo, if I ask you Daniel cuz you've been so\n\n139\n00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.040\nsilent there,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n140\n00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.540\n&gt;&gt; For the last few minutes.\n\n141\n00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.702\nBut if I ask you, what do you think\nsome of the main objectives, right,\n\n142\n00:07:14.702 --> 00:07:15.883\nof our computer friends?\n\n143\n00:07:15.883 --> 00:07:17.284\nWhat would be on the top of your head?\n\n144\n00:07:17.284 --> 00:07:18.422\nWhat would be in your list?\n\n145\n00:07:18.422 --> 00:07:20.262\n&gt;&gt; First thing I would think of\nis the gathering of the evidence.\n\n146\n00:07:20.262 --> 00:07:23.734\nTo figure out, what is evidence\nthat's going to lead us to?\n\n147\n00:07:23.734 --> 00:07:25.686\nHow this happened?\n\n148\n00:07:25.686 --> 00:07:28.770\nWhy this happened and who did this?\n\n149\n00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:30.910\nThat's what would be the top of my list.\n\n150\n00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.070\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nessentially identification of evidence.\n\n151\n00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.340\nAnd perhaps through\nthe identification of evidence,\n\n152\n00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:39.150\nstart to begin to be able to sketch\na story or sketch out a picture, right?\n\n153\n00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:43.000\nCreating picture in our minds begin to\ntell the story of what that incident may\n\n154\n00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.050\nhave been, what the motivations were, what\nthe reasons were, things of that nature.\n\n155\n00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:50.597\nSo, being able to recover, being able to\nanalyze, being able to interpret that\n\n156\n00:07:50.597 --> 00:07:54.156\ndata, but to do so in a forensically sound\nway would be one of the key objectives.\n\n157\n00:07:54.156 --> 00:07:57.048\nAlso, how to do so\nin a time sensitive way, right?\n\n158\n00:07:57.048 --> 00:07:58.120\nThis is also important.\n\n159\n00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.968\nWe don't wanna take Hours,\ndays, months, years, right,\n\n160\n00:08:01.968 --> 00:08:05.306\n[LAUGH] to examine this incident and\nthis crime scene.\n\n161\n00:08:05.306 --> 00:08:07.874\nThere may be an issue\nassociated with time and\n\n162\n00:08:07.874 --> 00:08:11.331\nthe loss of the ability to\nunderstand certain kinds of data.\n\n163\n00:08:11.331 --> 00:08:13.210\nBecause it is perishable,\nbecause it is dynamic.\n\n164\n00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:14.688\nIt is what we call volatile.\n\n165\n00:08:14.688 --> 00:08:18.496\nAnd if we don't have the right\nresponse at the right time based on\n\n166\n00:08:18.496 --> 00:08:20.670\nthe volatility of the evidence.\n\n167\n00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:22.177\nWe may lose the opportunity\nto capture that evidence.\n\n168\n00:08:22.177 --> 00:08:25.830\nSo, being time-sensitive\nbecause of evidence volatility.\n\n169\n00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:30.210\nIs also one of the key thought processes\nand main objectives of computer forensics.\n\n170\n00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:33.392\nCapturing evidence in a time-sensitive way\n\n171\n00:08:33.392 --> 00:08:37.470\nbased on what we call order\nof volatility of evidence.\n\n172\n00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:39.392\nSome evidence is more perishable and\n\n173\n00:08:39.392 --> 00:08:41.878\ntherefore needs to be\ncaptured before others.\n\n174\n00:08:41.878 --> 00:08:44.178\nMemory register data, cache data,\n\n175\n00:08:44.178 --> 00:08:48.560\nthings like that that's in the dynamic\nmemory or RAM of a system.\n\n176\n00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.420\nIs much more important to capture.\n\n177\n00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:54.207\nBecause once we turn the machine\noff that data is gone forever.\n\n178\n00:08:54.207 --> 00:08:59.676\nVersus the state of the machine,\nthe cabling around the machine,\n\n179\n00:08:59.676 --> 00:09:03.110\nthe peripherals that are plugged in.\n\n180\n00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.260\nYou can turn the machine off and\n\n181\n00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.160\nessentially none of that would change,\nright?\n\n182\n00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.810\nThe wiring itself would\nstill be in the same place.\n\n183\n00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:11.690\nAnd the fact that I have\na mouse attached to the machine\n\n184\n00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:15.280\nvia the right-hand side\nUSB port would not change.\n\n185\n00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:18.361\nAnd as a result, if I powered off\nthe machine, I would still be able to take\n\n186\n00:09:18.361 --> 00:09:20.767\na picture of all that, and\nthat would be perfectly fine.\n\n187\n00:09:20.767 --> 00:09:24.970\nBut what's in memory would evaporate\nthe second the power is gone.\n\n188\n00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:28.705\nAnd so there's definitely an important\nneed for a forensic analyst.\n\n189\n00:09:28.705 --> 00:09:33.664\nFor an incident handler that is doing\nthe job of the forensic investigator to\n\n190\n00:09:33.664 --> 00:09:35.921\nunderstand order of volatility.\n\n191\n00:09:35.921 --> 00:09:40.291\nBecause if we don't capture cached data,\ncache, as in C-A-C-H-E, or\n\n192\n00:09:40.291 --> 00:09:43.490\ncash-ay, as some people like to say,\nright?\n\n193\n00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:48.030\nCache data, register data that's\nin memory, those kind of things.\n\n194\n00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:48.730\nWe're done, right?\n\n195\n00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:51.940\nAnd so, for instance, one thing, if we can\njust take a look at my machine here for\n\n196\n00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.430\njust one second.\n\n197\n00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.443\nWe're gonna pretend you're not\nlooking at Helix right now.\n\n198\n00:09:55.443 --> 00:09:57.478\nCuz that's gonna be\nan upcoming demonstration for\n\n199\n00:09:57.478 --> 00:09:59.520\nyou in regards to how we\ndo some forensic analysis.\n\n200\n00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.450\nBut I just wanted to\nshow you one quick thing.\n\n201\n00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:05.330\nWith regards to the order of volatility\nand why it's so important to do this.\n\n202\n00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:09.496\nAnd I've done this\ndemonstration in other systems,\n\n203\n00:10:09.496 --> 00:10:12.467\nin other episodes for other reasons.\n\n204\n00:10:12.467 --> 00:10:15.342\nBut I'm gonna do it here with you\nnow again just to make sure we're\n\n205\n00:10:15.342 --> 00:10:16.350\ncomfortable with it.\n\n206\n00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:19.940\nLet me just change the background\non this real quick, and\n\n207\n00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:23.380\nyou can see this particular\ndemo is a realtime demo.\n\n208\n00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:26.181\nI didn't plan for it ahead of time,\nso I don't have my font size and\n\n209\n00:10:26.181 --> 00:10:27.041\neverything set up.\n\n210\n00:10:27.041 --> 00:10:29.800\nSo we're just gonna quickly\nmodify the background here so\n\n211\n00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.010\nyou guys can see this a little bit better.\n\n212\n00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:35.880\nCuz normally when we do this in the\ncommand line, we already have it set up,\n\n213\n00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:36.730\ncomes up like that.\n\n214\n00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:38.410\nIt's a lot easier for you guys to see.\n\n215\n00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:40.488\nNow you know all my secrets and\nyou know I get that, right?\n\n216\n00:10:40.488 --> 00:10:42.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, [SOUND] don't tell anybody, right?\n\n217\n00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:44.805\nAll right, so what I just wanna\nshow you quickly was this.\n\n218\n00:10:44.805 --> 00:10:47.310\nAnd for instance when we go out and\n\n219\n00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:51.536\nwe d o an IP config.display\nDNS is one example, right?\n\n220\n00:10:51.536 --> 00:10:55.763\nWe do an IP config display DNS.\n\n221\n00:10:55.763 --> 00:11:01.406\nYou could see all that information that\nis sitting there on the DNS cache or\n\n222\n00:11:01.406 --> 00:11:04.625\nthe resolver cache on the local machine.\n\n223\n00:11:04.625 --> 00:11:09.895\nNow if I,\ninstead of doing ipconfigdisplaydns,\n\n224\n00:11:09.895 --> 00:11:13.163\nif I add that to a file, right?\n\n225\n00:11:13.163 --> 00:11:16.334\nNow let me track real quick\nhere maybe one second and\n\n226\n00:11:16.334 --> 00:11:21.069\njust make sure that I can put that in the\nC drive so that I have a place to start.\n\n227\n00:11:21.069 --> 00:11:25.490\nLet me just put that in\nIntel directly real quick.\n\n228\n00:11:31.939 --> 00:11:36.395\nSo we're gonna output\nthat to the text file,\n\n229\n00:11:36.395 --> 00:11:41.570\nhere dnschace.txt, just so\nwe have a record of it.\n\n230\n00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:43.310\nSo we know what's there, right?\n\n231\n00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:48.188\nNow, when I do that and then I come\nback and instead of outputting that.\n\n232\n00:11:48.188 --> 00:11:53.808\nAnd instead of doing Displaydns,\nI do, do we have some dramatic music?\n\n233\n00:11:53.808 --> 00:11:56.271\n[SOUND] I do Flushdns.\n\n234\n00:11:56.271 --> 00:11:59.500\nThis is gonna clear that result recache,\nright?\n\n235\n00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:00.760\nI'm sure a lot of you probably know this.\n\n236\n00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.011\nThis is no surprise, right?\n\n237\n00:12:02.011 --> 00:12:03.906\nSuccessfully cleared that resolver cache.\n\n238\n00:12:03.906 --> 00:12:07.980\nSo if I then go back and\ndo display DNS again.\n\n239\n00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:11.080\nI get nothing,\ncould not display DNS resolver cache.\n\n240\n00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.970\nBecause essentially the cache is gone now.\n\n241\n00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:16.350\nI was smart, I captured that\nI have it in a file, right?\n\n242\n00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:17.850\nSo I do have a record of it.\n\n243\n00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:18.691\nThis is the exact kind\n\n244\n00:12:18.691 --> 00:12:21.181\nof thing we're thinking about\nwith order volatility of data.\n\n245\n00:12:21.181 --> 00:12:22.981\nAnd forensically examining and\n\n246\n00:12:22.981 --> 00:12:26.040\nunderstanding the impact\nof decisions we make.\n\n247\n00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.740\nWhen we forensically examine evidence.\n\n248\n00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:31.694\nThis is not, by the way, the proper\nway to forensically capture that data.\n\n249\n00:12:31.694 --> 00:12:35.902\nThis is just a quick and dirty example\nof what can happen if you're not paying\n\n250\n00:12:35.902 --> 00:12:39.270\nattention to details and\nyou shut down the machine.\n\n251\n00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:40.860\nBecause that data would be gone.\n\n252\n00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.390\nNow I do have a record of it,\nthat is absolutely correct.\n\n253\n00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:46.230\nI didn't do it in a foresnically\nsound way because I captured it to\n\n254\n00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:49.980\nthe system itself,\nmodifying the system that I'm examining.\n\n255\n00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:52.200\nAnd that's not an acceptable procedure.\n\n256\n00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.610\nI would have captured that\nto another system and\n\n257\n00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:58.410\nbeen able to take that out without\nimpacting the actual system I'm examining.\n\n258\n00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.840\nThat would have been the foresnically\nsound way to do this.\n\n259\n00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:05.000\nBut I just wanna show you that\nthe impact of making good or\n\n260\n00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.560\nbad decisions can either allow us to\ncapture or lose that information.\n\n261\n00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.340\nIt's very important for\nus to understand that and\n\n262\n00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:16.040\nbe aware of that as we're talking\nabout not just order of volatility.\n\n263\n00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:20.380\nBut we're talking about in general, how do\nwe approach capturing data from a machine,\n\n264\n00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:21.010\nand what do we do?\n\n265\n00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:24.430\nSo we've talked about the main\nobjectives of computer forensics.\n\n266\n00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:27.665\nThe role of computer forensics overall\nwe've talked about that as well.\n\n267\n00:13:27.665 --> 00:13:30.352\nThe idea of being able to help to\ndetermine what the incident was.\n\n268\n00:13:30.352 --> 00:13:35.170\nHow it happened, who was involved,\nthe who, what, when, where, why, and how.\n\n269\n00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:39.190\nFive ws in the age conversation, these are\nreally the roles of computer forensics,\n\n270\n00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:41.411\nor really any kind of\nforensics examination.\n\n271\n00:13:41.411 --> 00:13:46.450\nWhen it comes to an incident, we wanna\nput answers down on paper unequivocally.\n\n272\n00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:50.186\nAnd authoritatively say beyond reasonable\ndoubt based on examination of evidence.\n\n273\n00:13:50.186 --> 00:13:53.737\nThat that is indeed what has happened or\nwhatever the reason is,\n\n274\n00:13:53.737 --> 00:13:55.330\nthat is why it's happened.\n\n275\n00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:56.540\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n276\n00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:00.170\nWe have different types of computer\nforensics we can engage in.\n\n277\n00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:01.890\nThere is disk forensics.\n\n278\n00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:05.370\nYou just saw me examining information\non the local machine here.\n\n279\n00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:08.770\nThere's network forensics,\nlooking at traffic back and forth.\n\n280\n00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:14.570\nOne of our prior episodes, we did\na little show and tell demo of ngrep and\n\n281\n00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:15.990\nalso Wireshark.\n\n282\n00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:19.520\nThose are two examples of how\nwe would capture data that is\n\n283\n00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:22.780\ngonna be used potentially forensically\nin an investigation off the network.\n\n284\n00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:25.590\nSo network monitoring would be used here.\n\n285\n00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:29.095\nEmail forensics, looking at email,\nemail caches, things like that.\n\n286\n00:14:29.095 --> 00:14:32.290\nInternet-based forensics,\nlooking at web traffic.\n\n287\n00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:35.351\nUnderstanding what goes on,\nwhere you went, what you did.\n\n288\n00:14:35.351 --> 00:14:39.015\nWe may look at the Internet Explorer, or\nwhatever the web browser of choice is.\n\n289\n00:14:39.015 --> 00:14:43.463\nCaches, looking at the URLs you've\ngone to, cookies that are there,\n\n290\n00:14:43.463 --> 00:14:47.530\nsoftware that's been downloaded,\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n291\n00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:50.980\nSource code forensics,\nlooking at the code itself.\n\n292\n00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:53.150\nAnd using either a hex editor or\n\n293\n00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:56.940\na compiler decompiler tool to\nbe able to get under the hood.\n\n294\n00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:00.380\nAnd actually look at that code\nwould be of interest to us.\n\n295\n00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:03.320\nSo these are all different areas,\nif you will,\n\n296\n00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.110\nor types of forensics\nthat we may practice.\n\n297\n00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:08.882\nWhat about the process itself?\n\n298\n00:15:08.882 --> 00:15:13.650\nWe talked at a high level about\nforensics and a process for forensics.\n\n299\n00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:17.320\nBut let's kind of use the language of\ncomputer forensics to rebrand that\n\n300\n00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:17.869\nprocess.\n\n301\n00:15:17.869 --> 00:15:20.295\nIt's the same five steps.\n\n302\n00:15:20.295 --> 00:15:23.286\nI just wanna call them out from\nthe perspective of computers and\n\n303\n00:15:23.286 --> 00:15:24.759\nhow they would operate there.\n\n304\n00:15:24.759 --> 00:15:28.476\nSo preparation, collection,\nexamination, analysis,\n\n305\n00:15:28.476 --> 00:15:32.281\nand reporting would be the five\nsteps that we would involve.\n\n306\n00:15:32.281 --> 00:15:35.595\nOr think about with regards\nto computer forensics.\n\n307\n00:15:35.595 --> 00:15:39.185\nPreparation, collection,\nexamination, analysis,\n\n308\n00:15:39.185 --> 00:15:44.130\nand reporting instead of\ndocumentation it's reporting, right?\n\n309\n00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:46.170\nInstead of extraction, right?\n\n310\n00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:50.164\nIt's examination, that kind of thing,\nor collection rather.\n\n311\n00:15:50.164 --> 00:15:53.356\nJust think about the fact that we\ndo have the same kind of steps, but\n\n312\n00:15:53.356 --> 00:15:56.097\nwe're just naming them\nsomething slightly different.\n\n313\n00:15:56.097 --> 00:15:59.663\nBut we do still wanna make sure\nwe understand the reasons why we\n\n314\n00:15:59.663 --> 00:16:04.100\nneed the methodology, and how\nthe methodology plays into that for us.\n\n315\n00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:06.100\nLet's take a look, since we're here.\n\n316\n00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:10.000\nLet me just minimize this for\na second, let's go in and\n\n317\n00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.880\nlet's take a look at a tool that can be\nused to do some system forensics as well.\n\n318\n00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:17.700\nI mentioned the Helix tool, you could\nsee up on the screen in front of you.\n\n319\n00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:21.585\nNow, Helix, let me just bring up the web\nbrowser here real quick, just so you know.\n\n320\n00:16:21.585 --> 00:16:27.225\nHelix is an ISO, a Linux ISO, that is\na forensics ISO, incident response ISO.\n\n321\n00:16:27.225 --> 00:16:28.885\nIt's no longer being maintained.\n\n322\n00:16:28.885 --> 00:16:32.485\nThe last working version you can download\nis the one I'm showing you here,\n\n323\n00:16:32.485 --> 00:16:35.165\nwhich is the 2009 R1 build.\n\n324\n00:16:35.165 --> 00:16:36.675\nSo it's a few years old at this point.\n\n325\n00:16:36.675 --> 00:16:37.905\nIt still has some good tools in it,\n\n326\n00:16:37.905 --> 00:16:41.855\nsome basic things the access\nFDK tool kit is there.\n\n327\n00:16:41.855 --> 00:16:43.840\nSo we'll take a look at how\nto do disk imaging with it.\n\n328\n00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:47.460\nBut you just want to know that it is an\nolder tool that is not being maintained.\n\n329\n00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:50.990\nThere are newer versions of this kind\nof tool that you can look at but\n\n330\n00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:53.230\nit's still a very relevant tool for\nsome of the stuff we do.\n\n331\n00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:56.405\nYou could go out and\nfind downloads for it.\n\n332\n00:16:56.405 --> 00:16:59.160\nE-fense is one of the sites\nwhere you can download it.\n\n333\n00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.290\nIt doesn't cost you anything even\nthough they have a little web\n\n334\n00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:03.590\ncart kind of thing going on.\n\n335\n00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:04.540\nYou just, you know, order it.\n\n336\n00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:05.500\nIt's free.\n\n337\n00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:09.810\nTakes you I think about 24 48 hours\nto get the licence from them once you\n\n338\n00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:13.480\ndownload the download link, that sort of\nstuff, just so you can actually use it.\n\n339\n00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.400\nBut it's a relatively simple and\nstraightforward process.\n\n340\n00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.210\nIf you go out to DistroWatch,\nI don't know if you guys are familiar,\n\n341\n00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:23.440\nif you do a lot of Linux stuff, but\ndistrowatch.com, one of the sites\n\n342\n00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:28.110\nwe often use to keep\ntrack of Linux distros,\n\n343\n00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:31.900\nthinks like that on Helix,\nkind of tells you about it, OS type.\n\n344\n00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.730\nIt's based on Debian and Ubuntu.\n\n345\n00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:38.010\nAnd gives you a little information about\nit, and just the maintenance of it.\n\n346\n00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:39.950\nSo, you could see it is discontinued.\n\n347\n00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:43.020\nIt's not being maintained anymore, but\nyou can certainly go out and download it.\n\n348\n00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:44.000\nIt's fun to play with.\n\n349\n00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.241\nYou put it on a CD, or\non a USB device, and you boot up,\n\n350\n00:17:47.241 --> 00:17:52.141\nit's one of those autoboot active CD's,\nmuch like Knoppix or some of the others\n\n351\n00:17:52.141 --> 00:17:56.343\nthat you can boot live and\nyou can see I'm running it on Windows 10.\n\n352\n00:17:56.343 --> 00:17:59.300\nSo you can see I've got my Windows\n10 machine in the background here.\n\n353\n00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:00.310\nI've just booted it up actually.\n\n354\n00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:03.750\nI have just a little external\nCD drive that I plugged in.\n\n355\n00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:06.520\nSo I'm just literally running it\nfrom the outside of the machine.\n\n356\n00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.640\nThe really ironic part is I'm\nrunning it on a Macintosh.\n\n357\n00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Running Windows 10 is a VM in\n\n358\n00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:10.748\nboot camp.\n\n359\n00:18:10.748 --> 00:18:12.580\nRunning.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n360\n00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:13.450\n&gt;&gt; Of that.\n\n361\n00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:16.500\nSo when you think about what we do to\ndemo this stuff, it is kinda crazy.\n\n362\n00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.200\nYou wouldn't do this in\nthe real world obviously.\n\n363\n00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.260\nYou would have it running\ndirectly on a real machine.\n\n364\n00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.750\nBut for\npurposes of our demonstration environment,\n\n365\n00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:25.630\nI'm running it twice removed\non a virtual platform.\n\n366\n00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:26.150\nBut anyway,\n\n367\n00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:28.810\nthe point is when you go into this tool,\nit's got some interesting features.\n\n368\n00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:30.100\nLet's just quickly take a look.\n\n369\n00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:31.360\nTo guard some of the stuff we're doing.\n\n370\n00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.653\nYou have a little system information,\na little overview.\n\n371\n00:18:33.653 --> 00:18:37.250\nYou can go in here, it shows you the OS,\ngives you the basic breakdown of it,\n\n372\n00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:38.390\nthat kinda stuff.\n\n373\n00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:40.480\nCan we go full stream to\nsee that a little bit more?\n\n374\n00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.454\nSo you'll see we can go and\nwe can see that.\n\n375\n00:18:42.454 --> 00:18:46.411\nYou'll see on your desktop machine,\ngot the loop back address there.\n\n376\n00:18:46.411 --> 00:18:49.300\nMr. Nade is there, we always gotta\nsneak him in there somewhere, right?\n\n377\n00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:50.340\nSo you'll see that.\n\n378\n00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:53.230\nAnd we've got the drive breakdown,\nshows you everything going on.\n\n379\n00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:54.590\nNow this is just the overview.\n\n380\n00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:57.310\nThe interesting thing about Helix,\nyou click on this little icon,\n\n381\n00:18:57.310 --> 00:19:01.620\nthis little arrow here, and it opens\nup another window or another page, and\n\n382\n00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.550\nit tells you down at the bottom right\npage something of something so you know.\n\n383\n00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:08.260\nIt's got all the running processes so\nit tells us what's running, which is nice.\n\n384\n00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:12.224\nYou go, you highlight one of these and\nyou'll see it gives you, it's hard to see\n\n385\n00:19:12.224 --> 00:19:15.663\nbut it gives you the process ID at\nthe bottom, the PIT, so you can cross\n\n386\n00:19:15.663 --> 00:19:19.890\nreference that with information obviously\nto capture that, so that's kinda nice.\n\n387\n00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:23.355\n&gt;&gt; It's not the brightest thing to put\nthe black text on that gray background.\n\n388\n00:19:23.355 --> 00:19:25.790\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a little, but\n\n389\n00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:26.310\nit was the 2000s.\n\n390\n00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:28.320\nEverybody was just kinda hokie back then.\n\n391\n00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:31.590\nSo you could see we go in for acquisition,\n\n392\n00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:36.540\nlive acquisition, little camera icon,\n35 millimeter SLR going on there.\n\n393\n00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:40.040\nSo you'll see we've got a source that\nwe're capturing, we can choose physical\n\n394\n00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:44.100\nmemory, we can do a memory dump here,\nwe can do physical drive dump, right,\n\n395\n00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:48.450\nSD card or USB device which is actual\nCD that I'm mounting, right, so\n\n396\n00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:51.230\nwe can drive or\ncapture any of the drives that we want.\n\n397\n00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:56.670\nAcquired image, we could specify where\nto store that image, give it a name.\n\n398\n00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:59.130\nAnd then we can even split it onto CDs.\n\n399\n00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:01.530\nBack in the day you would chunk\nthe image if it was too big.\n\n400\n00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:03.630\nYou could do all that, so\nwe have that capability.\n\n401\n00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:08.610\nSo again, page one of something, we could\ngo in and we could do AccessData FTK\n\n402\n00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:11.540\nimager, remember I said we have\nthe AccessData FTK Imager.\n\n403\n00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:14.420\nSo the imager's kinda cool\nbecause what the imager does.\n\n404\n00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:18.340\nIs so rounded up here really quick this\nlet's us do a live capture of all hard\n\n405\n00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:20.780\ndrives and\nthen do a friends examination of that.\n\n406\n00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:21.340\nRight.\n\n407\n00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:26.290\nSo we can either add an evidence and\nsimply dd one drive or we can mount all\n\n408\n00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:30.830\nthe drives that are attached to this click\nmount all attached all drives you'll see\n\n409\n00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:35.710\ngood capping everything coming up there so\nit's loading NTFS Partitions.\n\n410\n00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:37.340\nYou see I have two drives.\n\n411\n00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:41.850\nI have my C drive, which is where\nI am set up and running, and\n\n412\n00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:45.610\nthen I've got my Boot Camp partitions,\nand so I've got my Mac hard drive,\n\n413\n00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:49.750\nEFS partition, got all the different\nstuff in here, so kind of interesting.\n\n414\n00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:51.880\nBoot Camp NTFS, right?\n\n415\n00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.120\nEtc.\nI can go in\n\n416\n00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:59.080\nI can go see my Windows partition,\nor I go in and see Program Files and\n\n417\n00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.020\ngo in and see what's running there.\n\n418\n00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:04.170\nI can go in under here.\n\n419\n00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:08.800\nAgain go in, essentially see,\nfor instance, Intel.\n\n420\n00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.700\nThat's where I was storing all that stuff.\n\n421\n00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:15.370\nThe DNS cache text right there\nthat I just loaded, so I can find\n\n422\n00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:19.540\nthe file that I just created from\nthe IP Config display DNS dump, right?\n\n423\n00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:21.420\nWe just did that a couple minutes ago.\n\n424\n00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:25.140\nYou can see it's right there\non the access data FTK imager\n\n425\n00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:27.820\nin the appropriate partitions to\nhave to know where to go look.\n\n426\n00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:31.010\nYou see I'm looking at it live and\nsee that when I highlight the file\n\n427\n00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:33.280\nMatt's receiving the contents\nof it right down here.\n\n428\n00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:36.980\nSo you could see that I can look at that,\nI can see a picture here.\n\n429\n00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:39.830\nIt doesn't display the picture,\nit may not have the right filter for it.\n\n430\n00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:44.170\nBut I could see the file, I can certainly\nsee this, so I can interact with data\n\n431\n00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:48.090\nthat's being captured, you see I\nright-clicked, I can export the file, I\n\n432\n00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:52.430\ncould add it to a custom image and capture\nit for a forensically sound image and\n\n433\n00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:55.740\nI'm gonna create off using a read\nblocker and have that as evidence.\n\n434\n00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:58.760\nI'm displaying the information\nright there from via text file.\n\n435\n00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:03.210\nSo I can grab this information and\nI can actually see it and\n\n436\n00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:04.130\nI can interact with it.\n\n437\n00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:06.510\nAll right,\nthe same thing with the image file, right?\n\n438\n00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:09.190\nIf I go and you know I could go out and\nexplore that file and\n\n439\n00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:10.330\nput it somewhere if I need to.\n\n440\n00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:14.570\nSo I can capture a drive image.\n\n441\n00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:18.320\nAnd then I could use that drive\nimage to then be able to create\n\n442\n00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:22.710\na integrity sort of I\ncopy using a harsh right?\n\n443\n00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:28.270\nAnd once I harsh and digitally sign\nthe image I have a forensically sound copy\n\n444\n00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:33.300\nthat is in every way the same bid for\nbid of the original but\n\n445\n00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:37.330\ni can work examine use essentially\nonline keeping the original data,\n\n446\n00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:41.080\nthe original hard drive\nall it's contents intact.\n\n447\n00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.420\nI would digitally sign and\nhatch the original drive.\n\n448\n00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:47.820\nI would digital sign and hash the image,\nthe two should match and as long as they\n\n449\n00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:52.400\nmatch I know that I have a forensically\nsound duplicate copy in images.\n\n450\n00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:56.630\nIn every way identical, and\ntherefore I can use that,\n\n451\n00:22:56.630 --> 00:23:03.310\nI can use that,in order to be able to\ndo my comparisons, do my analysis,\n\n452\n00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:07.910\nessentially do whatever I need to do to\nextract, examine, build my case, etc.\n\n453\n00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:12.260\nBut by doing that I'm not operating on\nthe original drive, I keep it intact,\n\n454\n00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:15.870\nI have the integrity, I operate on\nthe duplicate when I show up to\n\n455\n00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:20.820\ngive my report, and I'm either testifying,\nor I'm interacting with law enforcement or\n\n456\n00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:25.740\nwhatever, I'm able to certify\nthat the original the copy and\n\n457\n00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:29.820\ntherefore, all the evidence found in\nthe copy will be identical to the original\n\n458\n00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:35.030\nbecause the hashes, the digital signatures\nmatch and as a result, no big deal, right?\n\n459\n00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:35.870\nThis is good, right?\n\n460\n00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:39.830\nThis is what we want to see, this is going\nto be important for us to understand and\n\n461\n00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:40.840\nbe aware of.\n\n462\n00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:43.800\nBeing able to use a tool like this,\nalso very important, right?\n\n463\n00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.370\nSo, we have this tool in here.\n\n464\n00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:49.125\nLet's get out of this we go back look\nthere we go go back to where we were.\n\n465\n00:23:49.125 --> 00:23:52.791\nSo, we've this kind of tool right,\nso we also can go ahead and\n\n466\n00:23:52.791 --> 00:23:55.411\ncan do live RAM acquisition, live memory.\n\n467\n00:23:55.411 --> 00:23:56.086\nOf the system.\n\n468\n00:23:56.086 --> 00:23:59.843\nWe could use either Winen or Mantech MDD.\n\n469\n00:23:59.843 --> 00:24:01.680\nThere's a tool called Redline.\n\n470\n00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:04.730\nIt's not installed and\navailable here but you can use Redline,\n\n471\n00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:07.280\nwhich is a more popular,\nkind of a newer tool.\n\n472\n00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:12.860\nGot a nice interface, lets you generate\nan actual package that you save off and\n\n473\n00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:14.780\nyou go run on the target machine, and\n\n474\n00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:19.370\nas a result of that you're able to go\nin and you're able to then actually\n\n475\n00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:22.550\nexecute a batch file that\ngenerates all of the captures.\n\n476\n00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:25.940\nLoads them onto an external drive, you\nbring them back to the machine where you\n\n477\n00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:28.890\ngenerated the package and\nthen you examine them.\n\n478\n00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:31.400\nYou actually bring them up and you can\ngo through them, so, it's kind of nice.\n\n479\n00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.000\nThese are kind of old school tools,\nthey are command line,\n\n480\n00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.040\nthey run a little bit differently.\n\n481\n00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.110\nI'm not going to do a lot\nof memory capturing,\n\n482\n00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:39.060\nI got 16 gigs of memory on this thing.\n\n483\n00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:40.790\nIt's gonna take a while to dump it and\n\n484\n00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:43.620\nit doesn't behave well in\nthe virtual environment.\n\n485\n00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:47.080\nIt's not really designed to\nextrapolate virtual ram twice\n\n486\n00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.000\nfrom the physical machine.\n\n487\n00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.960\nThese tools, these older tools,\njust don't understand that.\n\n488\n00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.760\nThe new tools Tools can do it, but\nthe old tools, they just don't like it,\n\n489\n00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.270\nit just doesn't go very well.\n\n490\n00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:58.140\nBut you can see the idea behind this,\nand what we would do.\n\n491\n00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:02.110\nWhen we go over here,\nWindows Forensic Toolchest, we can go in,\n\n492\n00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:03.270\nwe can run a tool like this.\n\n493\n00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:07.895\nAgain, command line we could go in go in,\nwe could set up a detailed examination.\n\n494\n00:25:07.895 --> 00:25:10.495\nAnd I'll actually just show you\nwhat the config looks like in this.\n\n495\n00:25:10.495 --> 00:25:12.845\nWe're not gonna run it, but\nI will show it to you real quickly.\n\n496\n00:25:12.845 --> 00:25:17.295\nFirst responder utility, we could do\nincident report collection, set up Netcat\n\n497\n00:25:17.295 --> 00:25:20.805\nas a listener to be able to grab all our\nfiles and view the things we need to do.\n\n498\n00:25:20.805 --> 00:25:22.605\nIt's a very powerful set of tools.\n\n499\n00:25:22.605 --> 00:25:26.935\nLet's take a look at the set up here\nreal quick on Windows Forensics toolkit.\n\n500\n00:25:26.935 --> 00:25:31.880\nWe'll specify where we're going to\nput this into our new folder there,\n\n501\n00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:36.560\nsays you want to run tools executables\nthat may take a long time to run.\n\n502\n00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:39.890\nThere's a bunch of tools that will be\nsetup and run to profile the system,\n\n503\n00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:43.130\nsome will be very quickly\nothers will take longer.\n\n504\n00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:47.070\nSo what do you want to do take an hour to\nrun them, yeah we'll run them no big deal.\n\n505\n00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:49.420\nDo you wanna run tools that\ncan write to the system,\n\n506\n00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:52.150\nagain are we forensically\nexamining the system.\n\n507\n00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:56.750\nIf we are writing to the system\nbig no no right, we can't do that.\n\n508\n00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:59.235\nBut things like Sniffer,\nfor instance, right?\n\n509\n00:25:59.235 --> 00:26:02.895\nIn Mac and MD Check,\nthese are gonna look at files and\n\n510\n00:26:02.895 --> 00:26:06.655\nperhaps modify timestamps,\naccess, things like that.\n\n511\n00:26:06.655 --> 00:26:08.045\nSo we have to be careful about that.\n\n512\n00:26:08.045 --> 00:26:09.665\nWe may or may not wanna do that, right?\n\n513\n00:26:09.665 --> 00:26:11.195\nSo it's up to us, right?\n\n514\n00:26:12.355 --> 00:26:13.835\nAnd it does even tell you\nthere in the warning.\n\n515\n00:26:13.835 --> 00:26:14.575\nIt says hey, by the way,\n\n516\n00:26:14.575 --> 00:26:17.945\nif you do this you're probably gonna\ncompromise the system even more, right?\n\n517\n00:26:17.945 --> 00:26:20.663\nSo we have to give the case a name,\nwe'll do, IT.\n\n518\n00:26:23.255 --> 00:26:25.682\nProTV2 or whatever.\n\n519\n00:26:28.053 --> 00:26:29.351\nGive it a name of the investigator.\n\n520\n00:26:31.531 --> 00:26:39.000\nWe'll call it Danad, Dan and Adam, right.\n\n521\n00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.350\nAll right, so we got that.\n\n522\n00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:42.780\nSo hey, we're about to run all that,\nis that okay?\n\n523\n00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:47.710\nAbsolutely, then we get the little\nWindows Forensics tool chest, a little\n\n524\n00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:51.720\nCool little DOS graphic, that was back\nin the day where you designed a graphic,\n\n525\n00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:55.820\nyou know, by doing ASCII characters,\nto run through a series of screens here.\n\n526\n00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:58.400\nYou're essentially going to\nask it how to configure stuff,\n\n527\n00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:02.170\nso, it says you're providing, in\ninteractive mode you're going to run this.\n\n528\n00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:03.280\nAre you sure you want to?\n\n529\n00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:04.920\nYes, let's begin right?\n\n530\n00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:07.390\nWhat's the path and\nfile name for the config file.\n\n531\n00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:10.370\nCreates a default wft.config file,\nyou'd run that,\n\n532\n00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:13.760\nyou could go modify that if you want to\nput it somewhere, modify it differently.\n\n533\n00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:17.250\nWhat's the tool path that you would\nlike to use, the default is the root.\n\n534\n00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:19.030\nWhat is the OS or the path?\n\n535\n00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:21.540\nWhat is the OS path for\nthe commands you would like to use?\n\n536\n00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:25.030\nThe auto command, the auto default,\nor you specify a directory,\n\n537\n00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:26.600\nwhere's the command shell?\n\n538\n00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.060\nNow if you hit auto on this,\n\n539\n00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:31.410\nit's not gonna work cuz I'm not\non the root of the Windows shell.\n\n540\n00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:36.530\nSo I'd have to be in C:\nWindows/System32/Command.exe specified or\n\n541\n00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:39.160\nedit the command of the config\nfile to tell it that.\n\n542\n00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:44.059\nSo I'm gonna have to actually put that in,\nso I'm gonna type in a director path here.\n\n543\n00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:51.710\nAnd it's not enough just to\nsay see Windows System 32, you\n\n544\n00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:55.270\ngot to tell it what command shell to use,\nso you got to specify the whole thing,\n\n545\n00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:58.285\nthen it says, okay, I can find it,\nno problem, otherwise gives you an error.\n\n546\n00:27:58.285 --> 00:28:02.065\nAll right, so destinations can\ninclude a bunch of different things,\n\n547\n00:28:02.065 --> 00:28:04.385\nwhat's a destination path and\ndirectory we wanna use?\n\n548\n00:28:04.385 --> 00:28:06.645\nThat's where I told it to run, we do that.\n\n549\n00:28:06.645 --> 00:28:09.647\nWhat drives you wanna use,\nyou can specify whatever drive you would\n\n550\n00:28:09.647 --> 00:28:14.707\nYou would wanna use, if not use, specify\nauto, I could do C colon back slash or\n\n551\n00:28:14.707 --> 00:28:17.947\nwhatever it may and\nspecify different kinds of things, right?\n\n552\n00:28:17.947 --> 00:28:19.517\nSo I could just go in and do that.\n\n553\n00:28:19.517 --> 00:28:21.657\nAnd then what is the investigator name?\n\n554\n00:28:21.657 --> 00:28:22.827\nWe already have that.\n\n555\n00:28:22.827 --> 00:28:24.617\nWhat is the case name?\n\n556\n00:28:24.617 --> 00:28:25.627\nWe have that.\n\n557\n00:28:25.627 --> 00:28:30.587\nWhat hash format do you want to use, MD5,\nshy one, we specify what hash we want\n\n558\n00:28:30.587 --> 00:28:35.170\nto use, MD5 is our default Do you\nwant to run tools that are slow?\n\n559\n00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:35.910\nYes or no?\n\n560\n00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:40.270\nDo you want to run tools that can\nwrite back to the source, yes or no?\n\n561\n00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:42.280\nRight, do you want to use HTML reporting?\n\n562\n00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:43.680\nDefault is yes.\n\n563\n00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:45.230\nDo you want to enable prompting, yes or\n\n564\n00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:49.535\nno specified you wanted to automatically\nopen the completed report, yes or no?\n\n565\n00:28:49.535 --> 00:28:53.675\nAll right, so then it basically\ngives us our entire string.\n\n566\n00:28:53.675 --> 00:28:57.275\nYou can see it's building the command line\nand building out all the switches and\n\n567\n00:28:57.275 --> 00:28:58.195\neverything for us.\n\n568\n00:28:58.195 --> 00:29:01.205\nAnd it says okay, great, are you\nsure you wanna do this pretty much?\n\n569\n00:29:01.205 --> 00:29:02.485\nThis is what we're gonna do.\n\n570\n00:29:02.485 --> 00:29:05.315\nNow I'm not gonna execute this,\nthis would take a couple hours to run, but\n\n571\n00:29:05.315 --> 00:29:05.815\nyou get the idea.\n\n572\n00:29:05.815 --> 00:29:07.695\nFrom here you would say yes,\nand it's gonna go off and\n\n573\n00:29:07.695 --> 00:29:09.975\ndo all its stuff and\neventually it'll finish up.\n\n574\n00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.180\nSo this is\nthe Windows Forensics Tool Chest, right?\n\n575\n00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:15.190\nYou could set this up, you can run this.\n\n576\n00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:18.910\nWe could also go in and\nby the way from here, right?\n\n577\n00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:24.240\nWe can go in, just give that a second\nto spinning up, give it one second.\n\n578\n00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:28.470\nYou'll see we can also go in, we could\ndo a command shell, file recovery,\n\n579\n00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:32.150\nrootkit reviewer,\nscreen captures, SSH, right?\n\n580\n00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:34.250\nAll sorts of stuff, VMC Right, so\n\n581\n00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:36.480\nwe have all sorts of different\ntools we could do here.\n\n582\n00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:41.020\nWe could hash a file,\ndo a quick file hash, can also go in here,\n\n583\n00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:42.570\nthe third screen.\n\n584\n00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:45.870\nWe've got a bunch of old school stuff,\nagain, these are old.\n\n585\n00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:47.130\nThese tools are a little old, right?\n\n586\n00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:49.580\nSo, you got the PST Password Viewer.\n\n587\n00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:54.090\nYou got the Mozilla Cookie Viewer Right\nyou got the ie information,\n\n588\n00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:56.650\nwe can go in a grab all\nthat kind of stuff.\n\n589\n00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:58.110\nNetwork password viewer, so\n\n590\n00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:01.030\nit does all the forensics on all\nthe different utilities right.\n\n591\n00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:04.700\nWe could do a USB device drill down,\ndo the registry where I go in and\n\n592\n00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:06.585\ndo the registry and\ntake a look at the registry viewer.\n\n593\n00:30:06.585 --> 00:30:09.375\nRight you're about to\nrun your registry key\n\n594\n00:30:09.375 --> 00:30:11.585\nthat kind of registry program\nrather that kind of thing.\n\n595\n00:30:11.585 --> 00:30:14.715\nSo you could go and you could see we\ncould go in and do a registered scan.\n\n596\n00:30:14.715 --> 00:30:17.962\nAnd all it's really doing\nis essentially a right but\n\n597\n00:30:17.962 --> 00:30:20.912\nthis is bringing up the registry,\nlets you do a search.\n\n598\n00:30:20.912 --> 00:30:24.562\nBut the nice thing is you go out and\ntarget a remote computer and\n\n599\n00:30:24.562 --> 00:30:27.292\nor the local machine,\nsearch for certain strings.\n\n600\n00:30:27.292 --> 00:30:29.332\nYou know sometimes these old tools, right?\n\n601\n00:30:29.332 --> 00:30:30.866\nOld school tools.\n\n602\n00:30:30.866 --> 00:30:34.046\nThat Windows registry hasn't really\nchanged that much in probably close to\n\n603\n00:30:34.046 --> 00:30:35.056\nthirty years, right?\n\n604\n00:30:35.056 --> 00:30:36.226\nIf you think about it.\n\n605\n00:30:36.226 --> 00:30:38.506\nAnd, while a tool like\nthis may not be good for\n\n606\n00:30:38.506 --> 00:30:41.626\ncertain stuff because obviously,\nclearly there are limitations\n\n607\n00:30:41.626 --> 00:30:45.126\nto an older tool like this as I explain\nwith things like live memory dumps, right?\n\n608\n00:30:45.126 --> 00:30:48.226\nSome of that stuff may not work\nbecause of the nature of the new OS,\n\n609\n00:30:48.226 --> 00:30:51.870\nbut a registry is a registry, right.\n\n610\n00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:53.850\nAnd going in and just hacking away out and\n\n611\n00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:56.780\ndoing the file search,\nthat's gonna work regardless, right.\n\n612\n00:30:56.780 --> 00:31:01.540\nSo that's why I said some of these old\nschool tools are still really valuable\n\n613\n00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:05.880\nbecause they are gonna give you\nthe ability to do a lot of baseline stuff.\n\n614\n00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:09.780\nThat just as incident responder\nyou gotta have the basic tools.\n\n615\n00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:11.890\nJust like you need three\nkinds of screwdrivers,\n\n616\n00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:14.030\nright, or\ntwo kinds of screwdrivers in your toolkit.\n\n617\n00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:16.660\nYou need the flat head, you need\nthe Phillips, you need a couple different\n\n618\n00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:20.020\nlengths, right, in order to just be\nable to handle anything you find.\n\n619\n00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:21.190\nYou need a hammer, right?\n\n620\n00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:22.810\nYou need a wrench, that kind of stuff.\n\n621\n00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:25.740\nSo we wanna think about the fact\nthat this kind of tools,\n\n622\n00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:28.110\neven though they may seem a little old and\nhokey.\n\n623\n00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:30.600\nEven though they may not be up\nto the task to do everything\n\n624\n00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:33.470\nthat they able to just deploy tool\nlike this that boots off a CD.\n\n625\n00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:34.820\nIt comes up and\n\n626\n00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:37.920\nwith a couple clicks of the mouse can get\nyou into the registry and do what you\n\n627\n00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:42.170\nneed to do forensically making sure it's\nnot writing back, this is valuable, right.\n\n628\n00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:44.836\nThis is old school but\nthis is valuable, so keep that in mind.\n\n629\n00:31:44.836 --> 00:31:46.905\nLet's go back, I wanna show you\na couple of other things here.\n\n630\n00:31:46.905 --> 00:31:51.501\nIf we go back full screen please, you'll\nsee we'll be able to go in Be able to do\n\n631\n00:31:51.501 --> 00:31:54.514\na browse on the entire file\nsystem right from here.\n\n632\n00:31:54.514 --> 00:31:57.170\nNow I had it set up, you see,\nI've got stuff in the recycle bin.\n\n633\n00:31:57.170 --> 00:32:01.600\nOne of the things I like about this,\nit profiles every user on the system and\n\n634\n00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:04.490\ntheir security IDs, and\nlets you browse, and\n\n635\n00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:06.630\nlets you see what's in\nthe recycle bin by user.\n\n636\n00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:09.260\nSo you can see that I've\ngot a bunch of files there,\n\n637\n00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.720\nright, there's some text files,\nvarious things in there.\n\n638\n00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:12.850\nPNGs, etc.\n\n639\n00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:15.360\nProfiles, the file tells you what it is,\nright?\n\n640\n00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:19.030\nI can calculate the hash on the file\njust by clicking right down here so\n\n641\n00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:23.050\nI can see every user profile on\nthe box and see what they've done.\n\n642\n00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:27.980\nI can see that this one up here just\nhas nothing in the recycle beneath.\n\n643\n00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:30.400\nThere is that one, right,\nbut this active one hashtab.\n\n644\n00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.430\nSo I'm able to profile the file system,\n\n645\n00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:34.830\nsee everything that's in\nthere which is kinda nice.\n\n646\n00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:38.730\nI can browse for photographs so\nI can load up a directory, scan for\n\n647\n00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:41.050\nfiles I can find the file.\n\n648\n00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:44.190\nI can go ahead and open it up,\nI can enlarge it, I can work with it.\n\n649\n00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:46.020\nYou could do all sort\nof stuff in here right?\n\n650\n00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:49.960\nSo this is a very powerful\nlocalized set of tools and\n\n651\n00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:54.910\nthe nice thing about it is, when I'm done,\nI just go ahead and I exit, I close it.\n\n652\n00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:57.550\nDo you wanna save a PDF\nlog file of your actions?\n\n653\n00:32:57.550 --> 00:33:00.380\nYeah, right.\nI'll save that, no big deal right?\n\n654\n00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:01.120\nPut it over there.\n\n655\n00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:03.560\nIt's gonna pop up there for us, right?\n\n656\n00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:05.750\nAnd once we're done, right?\n\n657\n00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:07.540\nThat's it, right?\n\n658\n00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:11.760\nIs it feels good yet cuz it's running\non a CD so I just unplug the CD-ROM and\n\n659\n00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:15.700\nmachine still running and you wanna do was\ndoing I'm not in any way compromising or\n\n660\n00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:17.070\ninteracting not doing anything about it.\n\n661\n00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:19.830\nAnd so, it's nice because it\nallows us to be able to run.\n\n662\n00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:22.650\nIn real time on that machine, but\nit's portable, literally, right?\n\n663\n00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:25.310\nAll I have to do is just unplug, right?\n\n664\n00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:28.270\nAnd take with, right?\n\n665\n00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:28.830\n&gt;&gt; Voila!\n\n666\n00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:30.190\n&gt;&gt; Voila!\nAll I have to\n\n667\n00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:31.770\ndo is just take that\nwith me anywhere I go.\n\n668\n00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:34.480\nI actually had to buy one of these\nrecently, cuz I had to reload\n\n669\n00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:38.550\na couple of older laptops kind of like\nthese that don't have the built-in ones.\n\n670\n00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:41.560\nAnd I'm thinking here I used to have like\nall this kind of stuff when I have all\n\n671\n00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:43.410\nthe hardware and stuff in the office.\n\n672\n00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:45.600\nI couldn't find one, I had to go buy one,\nbut they're like $10 today.\n\n673\n00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.160\nI mean, when you think about what\nwe used to pay for these things.\n\n674\n00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.320\n&gt;&gt; They were insanely expensive.\n\n675\n00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:51.054\n&gt;&gt; I mean, the shipping was almost\nas much as the CD-ROM itself.\n\n676\n00:33:51.054 --> 00:33:51.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was crazy\n&gt;&gt; Crazy.\n\n677\n00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:53.370\n&gt;&gt; It's kinda nuts, right?\n\n678\n00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:57.260\nBut it's such a valuable tool also,\njust think about the real world.\n\n679\n00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:59.270\nAgain just not to overestimate and\n\n680\n00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:03.270\noversell it but an external CD and\nbelieve it or not, floppy disk?\n\n681\n00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:04.790\nAs crazy as that sounds.\n\n682\n00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:09.680\nExternal CD DVD and also external\nfloppy for systems that just don't have\n\n683\n00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:13.630\nthat capability anymore because\nmost of these modern small\n\n684\n00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:18.100\nfootprint laptops don't have built-in\n&gt;&gt; CD-ROM DVDs, right?\n\n685\n00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:20.950\nAnd not everybody carries around\nan old dinosaur like I do.\n\n686\n00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:23.620\nAnd so as a result,\nyou may need to run a tool like this, but\n\n687\n00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:24.960\nnot necessarily be able to do it.\n\n688\n00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:29.145\nOr what if you show up and the CD-ROM on\nthe internal unit itself's broken or been\n\n689\n00:34:29.145 --> 00:34:32.825\ndisabled by a hacker, cuz they don't want\nyou to run those kind of tools, right?\n\n690\n00:34:32.825 --> 00:34:34.355\nWell, there you go, plug it in.\n\n691\n00:34:34.355 --> 00:34:39.005\nYou usually have a drive or a bay, right,\nsome sort of USB connection that you can\n\n692\n00:34:39.005 --> 00:34:41.605\nrun it through, so it's important to\njust think about this kind of stuff.\n\n693\n00:34:41.605 --> 00:34:44.835\nThis is the basic stuff that\nexperience shows you and\n\n694\n00:34:44.835 --> 00:34:47.015\nthat you learn through\nyears of doing this.\n\n695\n00:34:47.015 --> 00:34:50.545\nBut starting out new, if some of you\njust have not been doing this as long as\n\n696\n00:34:50.545 --> 00:34:55.670\nperhaps myself or Daniel have, it's\nthat kind of just hard won in real world\n\n697\n00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:59.920\nexperience and advice that you need to\njust think about taking advantage of it,\n\n698\n00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:02.540\nbecause it could save you\na lot of time and trouble.\n\n699\n00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:05.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Adam, I do and I love the fact\nthat there individuals or groups of\n\n700\n00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:10.010\nindividuals out there that are creating\nthese toolkits, these live distros.\n\n701\n00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:13.450\nHave all these tools built inside of them,\nmake it really easy for us to start\n\n702\n00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:17.200\nplaying with things not that we can't\nbuild our own toolkits but if someone's\n\n703\n00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:20.480\nalready done it for me why not go out\nthere and download things like Helix.\n\n704\n00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:23.060\nYou know I'm into the whole\nethical hacking thing so\n\n705\n00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:27.090\nI have a copy of Kali Linux it\nmakes my life a whole lot easier.\n\n706\n00:35:27.090 --> 00:35:30.890\nI don't have to amass these things for\nmyself, it's already done, just grab\n\n707\n00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:34.710\na copy of Kali and I'm off to the races\nnow I know I can go grab a copy of Helix.\n\n708\n00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:38.960\nSo if I wanna do some forensics work,\nI can have that at the ready and\n\n709\n00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:42.170\nmake my life a little bit\nsmoother in the transition.\n\n710\n00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:45.520\nThat being said, look at our clock,\nwe've run out of time for this episode!\n\n711\n00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:47.700\nLots of great information in here,\nthough, people.\n\n712\n00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:51.790\nDefinitely watch this episode a few times,\nunderstand the forensics process.\n\n713\n00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:54.540\nEspecially as it pertains\nto computer forensics,\n\n714\n00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:58.850\nas that's what we're talking about,\nget the idea solidified in your mind.\n\n715\n00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:02.790\nSo that when it comes time to, maybe,\ntaking an exam, or just working it out in\n\n716\n00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:06.060\npracticality, you know exactly what\nthat methodology looks like and\n\n717\n00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:07.360\nhow it's supposed to be played out.\n\n718\n00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.670\nAdam, thanks for joining us today.\n\n719\n00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:12.350\nWe do thank our audience for\nwatching but, time to sign off.\n\n720\n00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:15.380\nFor ITProTV, I've been you host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n721\n00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:16.010\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n722\n00:36:16.010 -->

00:00:12.156\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.156 --> 00:00:16.029\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your ECIH show,\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.448\nIn this episode, we'll be looking at our\nforensic analysis and incident reporting.\n\n6\n00:00:20.448 --> 00:00:22.892\nThis is actually a part two so\nwith us today,\n\n7\n00:00:22.892 --> 00:00:27.540\nwe have the distinguished Adam Gordon\nto help us through this topic.\n\n8\n00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.220\nThank you for joining us today Adam.\n\n9\n00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.846\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Cherokee,\nalways a pleasure to be here.\n\n10\n00:00:30.846 --> 00:00:34.210\nAnd let's talk a little bit about what\nwe're gonna do, as we always do, right?\n\n11\n00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.404\nCherokee wasn't here for\nour last episode actually, so\n\n12\n00:00:36.404 --> 00:00:39.436\nmaybe good to just fill you in but also\nmake sure everybody's on the same page.\n\n13\n00:00:39.436 --> 00:00:43.765\nWe have been talking about forensic\nanalysis as she was just saying and during\n\n14\n00:00:43.765 --> 00:00:48.640\nthe whole discussion we've been having,\nwe've been looking at incident response.\n\n15\n00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.820\nHow the incident responders,\n\n16\n00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.570\nincident handlers, incident managers,\nhow do they deal with the issues and\n\n17\n00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.570\nconcerns associated with\na security breach of some kind.\n\n18\n00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.270\nThis particular case really have\nbeen drilling down a little be on\n\n19\n00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.240\nthe forensic aspects of the responder,\n\n20\n00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.120\nwhat's the methodology,\nwhat's the thought process involved?\n\n21\n00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.550\nHow do we establish chain of custody,\nhow do we handle evidence properly?\n\n22\n00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.120\nHow do we deal with evidence volatility,\n\n23\n00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.740\norder of volatility of evidence,\nwhat are the areas we look at?\n\n24\n00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.100\nNetwork forensics, computer forensics,\ndisk forensics, storage, Internet, email.\n\n25\n00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.027\nAll these categories, right?\n\n26\n00:01:24.027 --> 00:01:29.070\nOf places where information may scurry\noff to hide during an incident.\n\n27\n00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.643\nBecause the threat source, the bad actor,\nmay have engaged in some behavior,\n\n28\n00:01:33.643 --> 00:01:35.084\nleft behind something.\n\n29\n00:01:35.084 --> 00:01:38.809\nAnd as a result, if we could find that\nclue, that trail may lead us to who they\n\n30\n00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:42.240\nare, where they've come from,\nwhat they were looking to do.\n\n31\n00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.921\nThe concept of Kerckhoffs' principle,\nwhich we didn't really talk about and\n\n32\n00:01:44.921 --> 00:01:45.609\ncall out formally.\n\n33\n00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:49.931\nBut we talked about in other areas,\ncertainly in our CHFI conversations,\n\n34\n00:01:49.931 --> 00:01:53.200\nif you wanna follow up and\ndrill down a little more.\n\n35\n00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.250\nOn forensics, entire set of episodes\nthere that really goes in depth into\n\n36\n00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.120\nwhat we're talking about here.\n\n37\n00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.000\nBut in Kerckhoffs's principle, the idea\nis that whenever you have a transaction\n\n38\n00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.613\nbetween, let's say somebody who commits\na crime, an incident in our case.\n\n39\n00:02:08.613 --> 00:02:11.179\nAnd the machine or the entity or\nthe organization, or\n\n40\n00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:14.200\nthe area where that's been done,\nthe idea is that the criminal\n\n41\n00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.280\nleaves something behind and\ntakes something with them.\n\n42\n00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.044\nThat's what Kerckhoffs's principle\nrepresents in the study of criminalistics\n\n43\n00:02:20.044 --> 00:02:20.611\nand forensics.\n\n44\n00:02:20.611 --> 00:02:24.521\nAnd the idea behind this being that,\nif the bad actor,\n\n45\n00:02:24.521 --> 00:02:28.180\nthe threat source has some sort of agenda,\nright?\n\n46\n00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.060\nAnd they're gonna come in and potentially,\nthey're gonna wanna steal my mouse.\n\n47\n00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.990\nI like my mouse,\nI'm very attached to it by the way.\n\n48\n00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.231\nIt's blue, it's pretty,\nit's got a red light on the back.\n\n49\n00:02:35.231 --> 00:02:37.260\nIt's very nice mouse, right?\n\n50\n00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.382\nI don't want anybody to take it, but\nif they come in and try to steal my mouse.\n\n51\n00:02:40.382 --> 00:02:43.917\nThen if I show up on Monday morning and\nsee the mouse as gone,\n\n52\n00:02:43.917 --> 00:02:46.440\nI know something has been removed.\n\n53\n00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.407\nBut in addition to that, I can tell\nmost likely, more often than not,\n\n54\n00:02:50.407 --> 00:02:53.569\ndespite what you see on crime\ndramas on the big screen and\n\n55\n00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.750\nin TV, more often people\nleave things behind, right?\n\n56\n00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.040\nThere may be a fingerprint, maybe\nthere's DNA, who knows what there is.\n\n57\n00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.102\nMaybe they were sloppy and left something\non the table, whatever it may be, right?\n\n58\n00:03:05.102 --> 00:03:07.160\n&gt;&gt; So Adam,\nit's interesting you say fingerprint.\n\n59\n00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.890\nSo when we look at this\ntype of information,\n\n60\n00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.830\nare we really talking\nabout any kind of logs\n\n61\n00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.490\nwhenever we're performing any analysis\nto say okay, who acts as this component.\n\n62\n00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.387\nAnd kinda like seeing what\ntracks they left behind.\n\n63\n00:03:18.387 --> 00:03:20.057\n&gt;&gt; So it's a great though process.\n\n64\n00:03:20.057 --> 00:03:22.464\nWe could talk about a lot\nof different things.\n\n65\n00:03:22.464 --> 00:03:23.922\nA fingerprint generically, right?\n\n66\n00:03:23.922 --> 00:03:26.560\nCould be almost anything,\nas Cherokee is pointing out.\n\n67\n00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.570\nIt could be a log,\nan entry in a log, right?\n\n68\n00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.853\nIt could be perhaps the absence\nof entries in logs, right?\n\n69\n00:03:30.853 --> 00:03:33.120\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; The antithesis of what she was just\n\n70\n00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.636\nsaying, which is hey,\ndid they leave behind a line and\n\n71\n00:03:36.636 --> 00:03:39.770\na log that says I tried to log in and\nI failed.\n\n72\n00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.650\nWell they may have, but\nthe threat source, the bad actor,\n\n73\n00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.930\nmay have been smart enough to realize\nthat that may be a tell tale sign.\n\n74\n00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.093\nMaybe if they modify the log and\nremove that entry,\n\n75\n00:03:49.093 --> 00:03:52.228\nthen hopefully they're covering\ntheir tracks from their perspective.\n\n76\n00:03:52.228 --> 00:03:57.119\nBut if we're smart enough, maybe we're\nlooking at that log, noticing a gap or\n\n77\n00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:59.530\nnoticing some sort of oddity, right?\n\n78\n00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.440\nMaybe those entries don't line up,\n\n79\n00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.940\nmaybe they'll look proper, maybe there's\njust something weird about them.\n\n80\n00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.190\nAnd if we spend a little bit of time\nlooking at them, maybe we'll uncover that.\n\n81\n00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.040\nAnd so\nthis idea of what gets left behind and\n\n82\n00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.170\nwhat is taken with is one of the things\nwe look at from a forensics perspective.\n\n83\n00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.710\nWe've talked a lot about\nthe fact that digital evidence\n\n84\n00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:21.380\nis really defined as\nsomething that adds value.\n\n85\n00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.168\nIt has to be probative in value.\n\n86\n00:04:23.168 --> 00:04:29.000\nIt has to add value, add explanatory\nvalue to the incident in a positive way.\n\n87\n00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.370\nA way that allows us to understand and to\nthrough analysis ultimately tells a story.\n\n88\n00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.330\nBut it has to do so in a way that does\nnot jaundice or in any way bias or\n\n89\n00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:39.550\nmodify the facts.\n\n90\n00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.795\nIn other words,\nif we can't establish chain of custody,\n\n91\n00:04:42.795 --> 00:04:48.080\ncan't establish and understand definitely\nthat the evidence has not been modified,\n\n92\n00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.205\nintegrity is intact.\n\n93\n00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:53.189\nWe've ensure that through proper handling\nprocedures, through digital signatures,\n\n94\n00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:55.852\nhashing, all things we've talked about or\nbeen through.\n\n95\n00:04:55.852 --> 00:04:59.851\nIf those things are not present,\nthe evidence is most likely not useful and\n\n96\n00:04:59.851 --> 00:05:02.582\nwill as we've talked about,\nmore often than not,\n\n97\n00:05:02.582 --> 00:05:05.410\nnot be allowed to be\npresented in a court of law.\n\n98\n00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.862\nYou may still use that inside\nthe organization, right?\n\n99\n00:05:07.862 --> 00:05:10.954\nIn other words, you may be able\nto create an incident report,\n\n100\n00:05:10.954 --> 00:05:14.759\ntell the story of the incident,\neven though you may not have forensically,\n\n101\n00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:17.360\nsoundly analyzed and\ngathered the evidence.\n\n102\n00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.409\nIt may not in other words, meet the bar or\nthe expectation for value and for\n\n103\n00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:23.444\npresentation before a court of law.\n\n104\n00:05:23.444 --> 00:05:27.131\nThat doesn't come to use internally,\nbut it does mean that when\n\n105\n00:05:27.131 --> 00:05:31.060\nyou go outside the organization to\ngo to bringing law enforcement.\n\n106\n00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.916\nWe've talked about this, how do you\napproach external law enforcement?\n\n107\n00:05:34.916 --> 00:05:37.508\nWhat level or\nwhat art of responses they come in,\n\n108\n00:05:37.508 --> 00:05:40.494\nwhen they come in does that\nchange the rules of the game?\n\n109\n00:05:40.494 --> 00:05:44.793\nThe answer is absolutely, and when you\ndo those kind of things at that point,\n\n110\n00:05:44.793 --> 00:05:48.499\nevidence that has not been handled\ncorrectly is more often than not\n\n111\n00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:49.240\nthrown out.\n\n112\n00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.514\nUnfortunately, it's just\nnot seen as being valuable.\n\n113\n00:05:51.514 --> 00:05:54.414\nIt doesn't exist, in the eyes of\nthe law and the eyes of the court.\n\n114\n00:05:54.414 --> 00:05:55.947\nAnd this is a big deal, right?\n\n115\n00:05:55.947 --> 00:05:58.367\nBecause if we screw it up,\nlet's be honest,\n\n116\n00:05:58.367 --> 00:06:00.825\nthat's what we're talking about, right?\n\n117\n00:06:00.825 --> 00:06:02.378\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If we make a mistake, and\n\n118\n00:06:02.378 --> 00:06:04.413\nwe don't handle evidence the right way.\n\n119\n00:06:04.413 --> 00:06:08.535\nThen the problem becomes, that evidence\nmay be of limited to no value.\n\n120\n00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:10.983\nAnd we may perfectly, with the evidence,\n\n121\n00:06:10.983 --> 00:06:14.390\nbe able to prove beyond a doubt\nthat Cherokee took my mouse.\n\n122\n00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.770\nShe came over here, grabbed it when\nI wasn't looking and we have video.\n\n123\n00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.580\nWe could see that she did it, right?\n\n124\n00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.370\nBut if that isn't dealt with properly,\n\n125\n00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.220\nessentially it's like that\nevidence doesn't exist.\n\n126\n00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.553\nEven though we're looking at it,\nwe know she did it, right?\n\n127\n00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:29.289\nWe can't hold her accountable,\ncan't say she's guilty,\n\n128\n00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:32.600\nbecause the court will never see\nthat evidence as being legitimate.\n\n129\n00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.120\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nAdam you got to tell me here,\n\n130\n00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.280\nwhat can I do, are there any guidelines or\ncharacteristics that I\n\n131\n00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.520\ncould follow to help prevent that\nevidence from being thrown out.\n\n132\n00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.350\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so\n\n133\n00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:46.159\nwe talk about the fact that digital\nevidence has characteristics, right?\n\n134\n00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:50.814\nWe often talk about them as being things\nthat have to either be done or attached or\n\n135\n00:06:50.814 --> 00:06:53.110\nin some way associated with evidence.\n\n136\n00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.174\nWe often refer to these as the Bs.\n\n137\n00:06:55.174 --> 00:06:56.674\nWe call them the five Bs, right?\n\n138\n00:06:56.674 --> 00:06:58.002\nThe five Bs of evidence.\n\n139\n00:06:58.002 --> 00:07:00.786\nSo when we talk about\nthe characteristics of evidence,\n\n140\n00:07:00.786 --> 00:07:05.040\nwe think about the five Bs as in, you\nshould be this, you should be that, right?\n\n141\n00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.900\nYou should be or\nthe evidence should be admissible.\n\n142\n00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.027\nIt should be authentic,\nit should be complete.\n\n143\n00:07:10.027 --> 00:07:13.312\nIt should be believable and\nit should be reliable.\n\n144\n00:07:13.312 --> 00:07:14.520\nNo particular order, right?\n\n145\n00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.380\nJust generically 5 things, but\n\n146\n00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:20.740\nwe say that the characteristics of\ndigital evidence for it to be valid.\n\n147\n00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.179\nFor it to be adding probative value, for\n\n148\n00:07:23.179 --> 00:07:26.637\nit to be seen as being legitimate\nin the eyes of the court.\n\n149\n00:07:26.637 --> 00:07:31.114\nUltimately to be able to be presented\nat trial if necessary to further\n\n150\n00:07:31.114 --> 00:07:32.280\nthe discussion.\n\n151\n00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.648\nAnd create the evidence that may or\nmay not prove guilt or\n\n152\n00:07:35.648 --> 00:07:38.820\ninnocence before a court, before a jury.\n\n153\n00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:43.360\nEvidence must stand up to these five\ncharacteristics or prove and show and\n\n154\n00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.580\nhave these characteristics\nassociated with them.\n\n155\n00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:49.048\nHas to be admissible, authentic,\ncomplete, reliable, and believable.\n\n156\n00:07:49.048 --> 00:07:51.906\nAnd you know these are graded scales,\nright?\n\n157\n00:07:51.906 --> 00:07:55.378\nIn the sense that what I may think is\nbelievable may not necessarily be what\n\n158\n00:07:55.378 --> 00:07:57.340\nCherokee thinks is believable, right?\n\n159\n00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.955\nOur thought process may lead us to\ndifferent conclusions about the evidence.\n\n160\n00:08:00.955 --> 00:08:01.518\nThat's fine.\n\n161\n00:08:01.518 --> 00:08:06.151\nIf we say that based on video\nwe see somebody on the video\n\n162\n00:08:06.151 --> 00:08:10.685\ndoing something, may or\nmay not be somebody who's,\n\n163\n00:08:10.685 --> 00:08:14.678\nhow tall are you Cherokee probably about-\n&gt;&gt; 5' 7''.\n\n164\n00:08:14.678 --> 00:08:16.600\n&gt;&gt; 5' 7'', so about 5' 7'', right?\n\n165\n00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:21.250\nDressed in black and\nhas hair roughly the same colour but\n\n166\n00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:22.950\nwe can't see Cherokee's face.\n\n167\n00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.580\nWe may or may not know it's her.\n\n168\n00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:29.260\nBut at least we understand\nthat somebody who's 6.5 or\n\n169\n00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:33.060\n4 foot 12 like 5 feet is probably\nnot the person on the video.\n\n170\n00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:37.370\nSo we can start to understand and\neliminate but also zero in on things.\n\n171\n00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.520\nBased on how evidence maybe presented.\n\n172\n00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.270\nSo we have to think about what that means.\n\n173\n00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:44.640\nAnd obviously, some of those things are\na little more elastic than others, right?\n\n174\n00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.490\nBut ultimately,\nwe wanna make sure we understand that.\n\n175\n00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:52.905\nTo that end, let's take a look at and\ntalk a bit about some of the tools Tools,\n\n176\n00:08:52.905 --> 00:08:56.435\nright, that we can use to get\ninformation to do some of this.\n\n177\n00:08:56.435 --> 00:09:00.835\nAnd one of our prior episodes took\na look at the Helix Linux CD,\n\n178\n00:09:00.835 --> 00:09:04.145\nthe live boot CD,\nwent through some of the tools there.\n\n179\n00:09:04.145 --> 00:09:08.435\nWindows Forensic Toolchest,\ntook a look at how to do memory dumps,\n\n180\n00:09:08.435 --> 00:09:10.985\ntook a look at the FTK Imager.\n\n181\n00:09:10.985 --> 00:09:15.005\nWent through and talked about how\nto look for pictures on a drive and\n\n182\n00:09:15.005 --> 00:09:16.300\nall sorts of stuff.\n\n183\n00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.190\nI thought we'd turn a little bit,\nand just do a little bit of\n\n184\n00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:23.730\na focus on another set of tools that\nare really interesting, really valuable.\n\n185\n00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:27.320\nOften a lot of times many administrators\non the Windows side do know about them.\n\n186\n00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.400\nSome don't, and if you're not familiar\nwith them, great time for you to spend\n\n187\n00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.840\na few minutes learning about them, and to\ngo out, download them and play with them.\n\n188\n00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.090\nWe're going to sample a small\nsubset of these tools.\n\n189\n00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:41.220\nThere are many of them, I'm gonna show\nyou anywhere from maybe five to seven,\n\n190\n00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:45.200\nmaybe ten of them if we can do so in\na timely fashion, here in a few minutes.\n\n191\n00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.990\nCherokee's going to keep\nme honest with time.\n\n192\n00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:47.830\nBut you can see,\n\n193\n00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:51.681\nif we go to full screen just take a little\nbit broader look at this, we do put.\n\n194\n00:09:51.681 --> 00:09:54.209\n&gt;&gt; Adam these are,\nthis is going to be you've mentioned\n\n195\n00:09:54.209 --> 00:09:56.975\nthe other the previous tools worked for\nwhat Linux based.\n\n196\n00:09:56.975 --> 00:10:00.350\nBut when we look at these tools these\nare going to be Microsoft technology based\n\n197\n00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:02.730\ntools they were developed\nby Mark Russinovich and\n\n198\n00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:03.570\n&gt;&gt; That's really what we're gonna\n\n199\n00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.400\nbe focusing on right now,\nwhat you're showing us?\n\n200\n00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and the tools we mentioned before\nare a mixture of Linux and Windows.\n\n201\n00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.870\nWe actually did the Helix Live boot CD and\nused it against a Windows machine.\n\n202\n00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:15.310\nIt can run on either one.\n\n203\n00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:18.200\nBut there are Linux tools,\nthey are certainly based in Linux.\n\n204\n00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.040\nThese are, as you rightly point out,\nWindows-based tools, right?\n\n205\n00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.840\nSo they'll run on a Windows machine.\n\n206\n00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.313\nThey are developed by Mark.\n\n207\n00:10:25.313 --> 00:10:28.600\nUsed to be associated with a separate\ncompany Microsoft bought several\n\n208\n00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.520\nyears back.\n\n209\n00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.300\nIs now, one of the wizards and\ngurus at Microsoft,\n\n210\n00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:36.560\nwhen it comes to the Winternals,\nand syst internals toolsets.\n\n211\n00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.500\nThe guts of Windows, so to speak,\nhow we use tools to assess and\n\n212\n00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.750\nunderstand those things.\n\n213\n00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:43.670\nYou could see if we go back to full\nscreen just as I was going to point out.\n\n214\n00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:46.840\nYou could see just up in the browser\nwe always try to start off by doing\n\n215\n00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.470\nshowing you where we find the stuff.\n\n216\n00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:51.130\nWe usually will put these\nURLs in the show notes so\n\n217\n00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:53.800\neverybody knows how to find this\nif they want to go out and see it.\n\n218\n00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.980\nBut just went to Google and did a quick\nGoogle search for sysinternals or\n\n219\n00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.490\nwindows sysinternals right.\n\n220\n00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:03.760\n&gt;&gt; And this isn't any kind of subscription\nbased tool this is free of charge right?\n\n221\n00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:04.690\nThis is free of charge.\n\n222\n00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:07.970\nYou download them, well we've already down\nthe download, but you can see right here,\n\n223\n00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:09.130\ndoesn't cost anything.\n\n224\n00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:12.200\nJust do a quick search for\nthat term in the rectangle right up here.\n\n225\n00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.420\nYou'll get a link,\nlots of tech net as you can see.\n\n226\n00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.855\nThe whole suite is about 22 megs in size,\n\n227\n00:11:17.855 --> 00:11:20.841\nyou could download individual\ntools if you want to.\n\n228\n00:11:20.841 --> 00:11:24.277\nThey actually have a set of tools for\nthe nano server For 2016, so\n\n229\n00:11:24.277 --> 00:11:26.730\nyou can run it there if you're interested.\n\n230\n00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:27.920\nSo lots of different options.\n\n231\n00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.680\nSo just to start out with that,\nwhat I've done is I've created a little\n\n232\n00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.880\nhit list of tools that we're\ngonna take a quick look at.\n\n233\n00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.925\nSo it's just sitting there in the Notepad.\n\n234\n00:11:35.925 --> 00:11:39.700\nSo you could see the tools that we're\ngonna focus on, just run from the command\n\n235\n00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.030\nline, that way we have a sense\nof the ones that we're gonna do.\n\n236\n00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:45.000\nAnd you could see just right behind here,\nI just have the tools sitting in\n\n237\n00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.750\nthe directory in the rooted C drive,\nin a folder called CisINT.\n\n238\n00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.530\nJust created a folder,\nextracted the tools.\n\n239\n00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:54.610\nThey download as a zip file,\njust broke them all out, put them there.\n\n240\n00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:55.420\nAnd I just went through and\n\n241\n00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.700\npulled out some tools we're gonna quickly\nload up and take a look at, right?\n\n242\n00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:02.150\nSo what we'll do is just put the command\nprompt on top of this just so\n\n243\n00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.220\nwe can kinda see.\n\n244\n00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:04.410\nI'm gonna just move this down.\n\n245\n00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:06.900\nWe'll kinda do this is we\ncan make that work and\n\n246\n00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:09.850\nthat way it can kinda walk\nthrough one at a time, right?\n\n247\n00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:14.068\nSo accesschk, as you can see here.\n\n248\n00:12:14.068 --> 00:12:17.430\n64-bit versus 32-bit,\njust a quick word for you on this.\n\n249\n00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:20.180\nI'm running, as you've seen in some\nof the other demos, Windows 7.\n\n250\n00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.860\nI'm doing a 64-bit build of Windows 7.\n\n251\n00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:26.350\nThere are many of these tools will\nnot have a 3264 bit designation\n\n252\n00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:27.460\nyou just run them.\n\n253\n00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.950\nBut some are gonna be designated that way,\n\n254\n00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.340\nobviously just choose the appropriate\nversion for your OS right?\n\n255\n00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:33.490\nIf we're gonna be doing that.\n\n256\n00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:36.500\nSo when we look at\nsomething like accesscheck.\n\n257\n00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:40.720\nAnd my biggest challenge with these is\nspelling correctly, so forgive me ahead of\n\n258\n00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.950\ntime but I'm probably gonna make one or\nmore type of mistakes as we go.\n\n259\n00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:44.080\n&gt;&gt; I am right there with you.\n\n260\n00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.160\n&gt;&gt; So when we go ahead and\nwe type in a tool like this right,\n\n261\n00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.390\nif we're not sure what it does right,\nalways and without exception.\n\n262\n00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:50.930\nJust go ahead, as we've talked about.\n\n263\n00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:52.170\nThrow the little /?\n\n264\n00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:53.260\nup there.\n\n265\n00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:54.620\nTake a look at the help file.\n\n266\n00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:57.030\nIt's never a bad idea to see\nwhat's going on with it.\n\n267\n00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:59.820\nJust so you know, there's usually\nswitches associated with it.\n\n268\n00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:04.370\nIt usually tells you what the tool\nis gonna do or how it's gonna work.\n\n269\n00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:07.230\nSomething like that, I'm not gonna\ndo that for everyone of the two but\n\n270\n00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:10.290\nyou get the general idea and\ncan get a sense of that, right.\n\n271\n00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:13.210\nAnd so if we do access check 64 in\n\n272\n00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:16.900\nthis case you see we still need\nswitches in order to make the two run.\n\n273\n00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.380\nAnd so you would wanna take note of those.\n\n274\n00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:21.010\nThere's a couple of these tools\nI'm not gonna actually demo, but\n\n275\n00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:23.060\njust bring up the help file on,\njust to show you.\n\n276\n00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:25.540\nBecause there's so\nmany tool switches an options.\n\n277\n00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:28.140\nYou'd have to go through and do a bunch\nof different stuff to get them working.\n\n278\n00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.810\n&gt;&gt; So Adam, what are we looking\nat here with access check 64?\n\n279\n00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:31.790\nWhat's our goal?\n\n280\n00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:32.930\nWhy would we use this?\n\n281\n00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:35.320\n&gt;&gt; So, what\n&gt;&gt; Would be done with a tool like this.\n\n282\n00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.160\nYou can see right up at the top,\nand let's just highlight it so\n\n283\n00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.230\nthat way we can kinda see it.\n\n284\n00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:43.260\nRight, this is gonna give us effective\npermissions on securable objects.\n\n285\n00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:47.160\nIn other words, as an incident handler,\nas a forensic analyst,\n\n286\n00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.770\nas somebody who's responding.\n\n287\n00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:52.270\nWe're gonna often be put in the position\nwhere we need to look at a machine, or\n\n288\n00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:55.830\na group of machines, and we need to\nunderstand what's been done to it or\n\n289\n00:13:55.830 --> 00:14:00.190\ndone with it in order to achieve some\nsort of nefarious end, some bad result.\n\n290\n00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:03.285\nAnd so a lot of time\n&gt;&gt; Files are modified.\n\n291\n00:14:03.285 --> 00:14:07.005\nA lot of times files or software,\nis either added, removed or\n\n292\n00:14:07.005 --> 00:14:08.925\nmodified in these events.\n\n293\n00:14:08.925 --> 00:14:12.365\nAnd we need to understand what\nthe baseline may look like on a system in\n\n294\n00:14:12.365 --> 00:14:15.205\norder to see whether or\nnot certain files have been modified.\n\n295\n00:14:15.205 --> 00:14:18.715\nHas somebody change\nthe permissions on a directory?\n\n296\n00:14:18.715 --> 00:14:19.305\nOn a file?\n\n297\n00:14:19.305 --> 00:14:21.080\nWhatever the case may be.\n\n298\n00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.350\n&gt;&gt; And so when we use a tool like this,\n\n299\n00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:26.660\nwhat it does,\ndepending on the switches that you use.\n\n300\n00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:30.350\nIt will run a report out for you,\nyou can export to a text file or\n\n301\n00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:31.770\nwhatever you wanna do.\n\n302\n00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:35.280\nAnd it will give you a listen\nof what the permissions are.\n\n303\n00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:40.300\nAnd you can see we have things like\nregistry key capability there with the -k.\n\n304\n00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.220\nWe can do files that are gonna\ngo out to a printer.\n\n305\n00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.110\nAnd so, we can output that way.\n\n306\n00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:48.448\nWe can do a directory,\nparse the sub-directories,\n\n307\n00:14:48.448 --> 00:14:52.730\navoid the sub-directories, look at an\nindividual file, look at a group of files.\n\n308\n00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:57.790\nSo this is really just a very\nfancy attribute reader and\n\n309\n00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:02.000\npermission assessor tool that will\ngive us the ability to understand\n\n310\n00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.530\nwhat goes on with one or\nmore of these files.\n\n311\n00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:08.400\nSame kind of concept but\nfrom a slightly different perspective.\n\n312\n00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.030\nLet's just clear the screen so we have\nan easy way to keep track of things.\n\n313\n00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:15.900\nWhen we look at accessenum,\na lot of these tools will load.\n\n314\n00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:19.660\nThere's usually a, and you're\nprobably not gonna see it very often\n\n315\n00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.470\nin this demo because I've\nalready loaded the tools.\n\n316\n00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:24.390\nSo they're not gonna come up\nwith a licensing disclaimer.\n\n317\n00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:27.860\nBut there's always a license disclaim that\ncomes up the first time you run the tool,\n\n318\n00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.160\nyou just have to accept it and\n\n319\n00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.660\nthen it usually loads a GUI\nof some kind like this.\n\n320\n00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.300\nOr the command line will kick in,\njust depending on what the tool does.\n\n321\n00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.810\nAccess enum, access enumeration.\n\n322\n00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:37.656\nThe nice thing about these tools,\n\n323\n00:15:37.656 --> 00:15:38.921\nyou can tend to tell what\nthey are based on the name.\n\n324\n00:15:38.921 --> 00:15:42.330\n&gt;&gt; I know, I was gonna ask you,\nit seems pretty self-explanatory.\n\n325\n00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:43.330\n&gt;&gt; More or less, a lot of them are.\n\n326\n00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:44.560\nA couple of them are a little weird,\n\n327\n00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.740\nbut most of them are pretty much gonna\nbe what you would think they would be.\n\n328\n00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:51.318\nAnd so what this does is,\nthis displays who has access to items,\n\n329\n00:15:51.318 --> 00:15:53.654\nwhether directory or registered key is.\n\n330\n00:15:53.654 --> 00:15:57.448\nSo it's a slightly different\ntake on the access check.\n\n331\n00:15:57.448 --> 00:16:00.697\nIt's a GUI that will give us more or\nless the same kind of information.\n\n332\n00:16:00.697 --> 00:16:04.433\nSo you'll see the default directory that\nI have got a set up here is C:\\\\Windows.\n\n333\n00:16:04.433 --> 00:16:07.338\nI can go to the registry, go to\nthe directory just figure out what I want\n\n334\n00:16:07.338 --> 00:16:10.260\nthere, there's a little pull down so\nthat I can browse, right.\n\n335\n00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.915\nFind a specific area hit Scan and\nobviously the C://Windows\n\n336\n00:16:13.915 --> 00:16:16.685\ndirectory departs that it will\ntake a little while to go through.\n\n337\n00:16:16.685 --> 00:16:20.225\nWe're not just going to let that run in\nthe background, but you can see that.\n\n338\n00:16:20.225 --> 00:16:22.505\nCould we just go full-screen real quick so\nwe can see that a little bit bigger?\n\n339\n00:16:22.505 --> 00:16:23.835\nYou can see that running.\n\n340\n00:16:23.835 --> 00:16:26.570\nSo you see it's just parsing the files,\njust going through there.\n\n341\n00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:29.630\nAnd as it's going through,\nyou can see it's just loading them up.\n\n342\n00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.240\nAnd we can see,\nwe'll just scroll over just so\n\n343\n00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:36.110\nyou can see, for C &gt; Windows,\nyou'll see we have the permission there.\n\n344\n00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:41.700\nRead for the administrator and\nthe NT service account, and trusted users.\n\n345\n00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.290\nWhoever else has rights to that.\n\n346\n00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:46.570\nAnd we have right and there may\nbe a deny permission if there is,\n\n347\n00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:47.660\nthat'll be registered.\n\n348\n00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:49.680\nSo these are the simple permissions.\n\n349\n00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.970\nWe're not talking about the detailed,\nvery granular.\n\n350\n00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:55.260\nTwo different kinds of reads,\n\n351\n00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.900\nthree different kinds of rights in\nthe special permission category.\n\n352\n00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:00.330\nWe're looking at very high\nlevel basic permissions.\n\n353\n00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:02.160\nBut it's a little piece of the puzzle.\n\n354\n00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:07.120\nAnd the thing you have to remember\nabout this when we do incident and\n\n355\n00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:11.500\nforensic analysis work, we're not gonna\nhave necessarily more often than not.\n\n356\n00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:15.240\nUnless it's a pretty very obvious\nkinda open and shut kinda thing.\n\n357\n00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:19.720\nYou walk in and the computer is laying on\nthe ground, and there's a chalk outline\n\n358\n00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:23.100\nnext to it and the computer was\nused to hit the person on the head.\n\n359\n00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:26.950\nYou gotta do some digging typically\nto figure stuff out, especially when\n\n360\n00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:31.970\nwe're dealing with files and permissions\nand all the things that go on inside of\n\n361\n00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:35.000\nsystem that may have a million or\nmore lines of code running in it.\n\n362\n00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.380\n&gt;&gt; So, Adam, I was thinking about that and\nfrom looking at it from\n\n363\n00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:43.850\na digital forensics investigative\nkind of context, we're not trying to\n\n364\n00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:48.490\nrun these tools like other system admins\nor network admins would be just as\n\n365\n00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:52.330\nnormal monitoring techniques\n&gt;&gt; We would be performing this locally\n\n366\n00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:55.460\nusually on that copy of the hard\ndrive that has already been created,\n\n367\n00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:57.090\nis that how we would be using these tools?\n\n368\n00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:59.430\n&gt;&gt; Correct, so\nwe talked in our last episode.\n\n369\n00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:01.610\nIf you haven't seen it, encourage\nyou to go back, just take a look and\n\n370\n00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:04.790\nget some of the background thought\nprocesses that Cherokee and\n\n371\n00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:06.500\nI are discussing with you now.\n\n372\n00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.370\nBut the exact thing Cherokee just said,\nright,\n\n373\n00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:11.430\nto remind you of the fact that\nwe're using this typically\n\n374\n00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:15.030\non a forensically sound\ncopy of the original data.\n\n375\n00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:17.670\nSo this would not be run\nthe way we're doing it here.\n\n376\n00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:20.280\nAs we gave you a big disclaimer in\nthe last show about the same thing we did\n\n377\n00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.670\nhelix, we would typically not\ndo it against the local machine\n\n378\n00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:26.200\nbecause we would fear it\nin deem it correct in\n\n379\n00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.730\nour assumption that we would\nmodify evidence, right?\n\n380\n00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:29.810\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n&gt;&gt; To your point,\n\n381\n00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:32.680\nwhat we would do instead is\nmake a forensically sound copy,\n\n382\n00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.600\na bit-stream copy of that drive\n&gt;&gt; We would do that with\n\n383\n00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.300\na drive imaging program.\n\n384\n00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.500\nWe've shown you FTK Imager.\n\n385\n00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:44.150\nThere's DD, the Linux command\nline tool that does imaging.\n\n386\n00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:46.720\nWe mentioned some tools in\nthe show notes for this episode.\n\n387\n00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.290\nThere's a list of them at the end\nwith some syntax and stuff.\n\n388\n00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:50.870\nEncourage you to take a look at those.\n\n389\n00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:53.170\nDD's on that list, there's many others.\n\n390\n00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:56.080\nThere is config LS and things like that.\n\n391\n00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.390\nJust some letting stools like\nthat maybe they are valued to and\n\n392\n00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:59.920\nyou wanna know a little more about.\n\n393\n00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:05.180\nBut we would run this against a friends\nwith sound copy of the dialogue or\n\n394\n00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:06.190\nthe hard drive Right?\n\n395\n00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:10.840\nAnd then in doing so not worried about\nmodifying the original because obviously\n\n396\n00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:14.680\nif we did, that's it, game over,\nthe evidence is no longer valid.\n\n397\n00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:18.890\nSo, we would wanna look at this but the\nother thing I was just gonna mention was,\n\n398\n00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:20.460\nthese are just basic permissions.\n\n399\n00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.650\nThis is one piece of\na much broader puzzle.\n\n400\n00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:25.720\nWe're not gonna typically of one tool\nthat gives us everything we need.\n\n401\n00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:30.700\nI mean we do in some cases, but more often\nthan not we're gonna run multiple tools\n\n402\n00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:35.840\nto assess information, cross-referencing\nand reinforcing the findings as we go.\n\n403\n00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:39.760\nAnd if we get the same information\nfrom two or three different sources,\n\n404\n00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.930\nwe tend to say that that's\nan authoritative understanding.\n\n405\n00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:44.900\nBut if we get different\nanswers from two or\n\n406\n00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:47.780\nthree different tools, then we\nprobably have some confusion, right?\n\n407\n00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:50.650\nThere may be something we have\nto dig deeper in and clarify.\n\n408\n00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:52.480\nJust wanna keep that in\nmind to think about that.\n\n409\n00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.290\n&gt;&gt; So we're just kind of on a little\nhunt looking for some golden nuggets or\n\n410\n00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:59.590\nsome leads that may bring us on that\nright path to continue our investigation.\n\n411\n00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:01.100\n&gt;&gt; That's a great way of\nthinking about it, yeah.\n\n412\n00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:02.965\nI mean, it's like a treasure hunt, right?\n\n413\n00:20:02.965 --> 00:20:04.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, all right,\n\n414\n00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:05.970\nso let's look at another tool.\n\n415\n00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:07.650\nThis one is one I like a lot.\n\n416\n00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:11.840\nAutoruns, this is, we'll just bring\nthis up so you can see it up here.\n\n417\n00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:15.230\nThis is a tool that a lot of people\ntend to use for a variety of things.\n\n418\n00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:16.610\nIf you get malware in your system,\n\n419\n00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:19.150\nthis is the kind of tool that may\nhelp you figure out it's there.\n\n420\n00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:21.570\nIf you have root kit,\nit may help you to figure out it's there.\n\n421\n00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:27.300\nThis is like a combination of task\nmanager with the process list and\n\n422\n00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:30.350\na combination of other areas.\n\n423\n00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:31.600\nLooking at drivers,\n\n424\n00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:36.440\nlooking at services, looking at tasks,\nlooking at the Windows Explorer.\n\n425\n00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:40.420\nYou got a lot of the gooey tools\nthat are variables in Windows and\n\n426\n00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:44.540\ndifferent places, brought together, so\nwe can see exactly what's happening.\n\n427\n00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:49.020\nBut the nice thing about this\naside from that Is, we'll see for\n\n428\n00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:52.150\ninstance register keys here,\nyou could see I have one highlighted.\n\n429\n00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:56.480\nLet's just go and\nlet's take a look at spy,\n\n430\n00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:03.450\nthe anti key logger software that we used\nfor one of our prior episodes right?\n\n431\n00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:05.600\nSo when we look at spy shelter.\n\n432\n00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.320\nRight, what we can do is, you take a look.\n\n433\n00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.190\nWe can delete that,\nremove that registry key right from here.\n\n434\n00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:12.570\nWe can go to the image,\nfind out where it's running.\n\n435\n00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:14.740\nVerify it, so we can go out on the web and\n\n436\n00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:17.300\nsee if it looks like it's\nlegitimate software or not.\n\n437\n00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:22.770\nCheck one more of that known none enter\nno work antivirus websites for reporting.\n\n438\n00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:25.816\nHey is this known extension,\nis this file potentially malware?\n\n439\n00:21:25.816 --> 00:21:28.158\nSo we could right-click and\ngo up to the web and\n\n440\n00:21:28.158 --> 00:21:30.230\nsee whether there is a report on that.\n\n441\n00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:31.730\nRight just inside the GUI realtime.\n\n442\n00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:32.850\nSo what are they looking for\n\n443\n00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:37.880\nwhen they're verifying like digitally\nsigned drivers or any kind of hash values?\n\n444\n00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.680\nWe typically would look for\ndigitally signed drivers so\n\n445\n00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.800\nessentially it has stinger value.\n\n446\n00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:48.820\nWe may be looking at a known\nreference point as a driver,\n\n447\n00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:53.830\nnot a driver, a signature, an uploaded\nsignature for the anti virus program.\n\n448\n00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:56.870\nIf we saw that a certain\nfile either something,\n\n449\n00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:59.820\nsomething dot dll or\nsomething, something, dot.\n\n450\n00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:04.810\nYou know, exe or whatever it may be but\nif it was named a certain way or if it had\n\n451\n00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:08.370\ncertain properties, all those things would\nbe part of a profile typically, right?\n\n452\n00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:11.330\nAnd then we would see them or\nat least when we do the assessment,\n\n453\n00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.850\nwe would be able to go out and say, look\nthat's funny that looks just like that\n\n454\n00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:17.960\nfile that potentially may give us\na virus signature that we would match.\n\n455\n00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:19.800\nSo we look for that kind of stuff.\n\n456\n00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:23.250\nWe can go to process explorer so\nwe can see what's happening with it.\n\n457\n00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:26.950\nSo you this tool is very valuable\nbecause we can go through and\n\n458\n00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:29.710\nsee by category different\nthings that are happening,\n\n459\n00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:31.710\nas you just see me kinda\nclicking through here.\n\n460\n00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:35.400\nAll the registry keys associated\nwith these various areas,\n\n461\n00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.310\ndo we have any schedule tasks?\n\n462\n00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:40.120\nA lot of times,\nmalware is inserted into a system and\n\n463\n00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:43.910\nburied in the command line with\nthe Windows AT command or Task Scheduler.\n\n464\n00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:46.830\nAnd you don't know it's running unless\nyou go to look at a complete listing of\n\n465\n00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:49.350\nall the scheduled tasks that are there to,\n\n466\n00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:53.760\nevery hour, check on the deployment status\nand redeploy or something like that.\n\n467\n00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.290\nSo this tool will expose that.\n\n468\n00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:56.900\nI mean, when was the last you went and\n\n469\n00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.360\nlooked at all the scheduled\ntasks in your system?\n\n470\n00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.175\nYou may not even realize that you can.\n\n471\n00:23:01.175 --> 00:23:02.385\nYou may not know how to do that.\n\n472\n00:23:02.385 --> 00:23:07.015\nIt's just not something we typically do\nand there's not an easy way to do that.\n\n473\n00:23:07.015 --> 00:23:09.325\nSo this would give you that visibility,\nright?\n\n474\n00:23:09.325 --> 00:23:11.885\nSo it's got a lot of really\nneat little features.\n\n475\n00:23:11.885 --> 00:23:13.985\nWe could see all the services\nthat are running.\n\n476\n00:23:13.985 --> 00:23:15.825\nSo you could see them here.\n\n477\n00:23:15.825 --> 00:23:21.490\nAgain, go in, find any of the,\nthere we go, find any of the services.\n\n478\n00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:22.990\nWe could stop a service, delete it.\n\n479\n00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:24.710\nThere's all sorts of stuff we can do here.\n\n480\n00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:27.810\nSo auto runs is a pretty neat little tool.\n\n481\n00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:29.270\nGuess my mouse does not translate, what?\n\n482\n00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:30.570\n&gt;&gt; You know what?\nActually, can you do that again?\n\n483\n00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:31.250\nOr did you close it?\n\n484\n00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:31.780\nYou're inside of it.\n\n485\n00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:33.140\n&gt;&gt; Can I click,\nyou want me to open it back up?\n\n486\n00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:35.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI saw something that I wanted to mention.\n\n487\n00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:38.430\nI didn't know this til I was\nwatching a demonstration one day\n\n488\n00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:40.300\nfrom Mark Resinovich.\n\n489\n00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:43.230\nWhen you clicked on that it\nsaid check with virus total.\n\n490\n00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:44.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Which they've integrated with that.\n\n491\n00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:46.070\nWhich is a database like you\n\n492\n00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.607\nwere mentioning\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n493\n00:23:46.607 --> 00:23:51.648\n&gt;&gt; Checking those profiles\nwhere security professionals\n\n494\n00:23:51.648 --> 00:23:56.480\nwill add any kind of bad software or\nbad IP addresses.\n\n495\n00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:00.065\nIt's basically a database of\nany kind of known Bad actors.\n\n496\n00:24:00.065 --> 00:24:02.156\nSo it's actually integrated\nwith this software.\n\n497\n00:24:02.156 --> 00:24:04.070\nIt's pretty cool.\n\n498\n00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:06.062\n&gt;&gt; It's a little slow to come up, but yes.\n\n499\n00:24:06.062 --> 00:24:07.060\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I clicked on it.\n\n500\n00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:07.760\nIt is coming up.\n\n501\n00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:08.980\n&gt;&gt; Just rewind it real quick.\n\n502\n00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:09.810\nLook for virus total.\n\n503\n00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:11.640\n&gt;&gt; I right-clicked and I clicked on it.\n\n504\n00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:12.880\nIt's just-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n505\n00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.430\n&gt;&gt; It comes up with a little\nprompt that says you gotta\n\n506\n00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:16.090\naccept the terms of service now.\n\n507\n00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:18.830\nAnd so, that's what we're\nwaiting on is the thing to load.\n\n508\n00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:19.340\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But yeah, no,\n\n509\n00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:20.970\ncuz while you were talking, I did that.\n\n510\n00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:22.306\nI actually clicked on it to bring it up.\n\n511\n00:24:22.306 --> 00:24:23.294\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Well, you know me,\n\n512\n00:24:23.294 --> 00:24:24.375\nI can multitask here.\n\n513\n00:24:24.375 --> 00:24:25.990\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it will load.\n\n514\n00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:26.700\nThere it is right there.\n\n515\n00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:29.810\nIt takes a minute to load in the demo\nenvironment cuz it's a little slow going\n\n516\n00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:33.100\nout through all the layers of\nvirtualization that we're running.\n\n517\n00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:37.280\nRemember, this is a Windows 7 VM running\non top of a Windows 10 VM running on\n\n518\n00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.742\na Macintosh machine that's\nrunning in bootcamp.\n\n519\n00:24:39.742 --> 00:24:40.803\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it's about four\n\n520\n00:24:40.803 --> 00:24:43.560\nlayers of abstraction before\nwe get to the outside world.\n\n521\n00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:44.990\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n&gt;&gt; But as Cherokee was saying,\n\n522\n00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:46.430\nyou can see behind the scenes there,\n\n523\n00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:48.670\nother than just accepting\nthe virus total terms of service.\n\n524\n00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:50.870\nYou do that one time and then it comes up.\n\n525\n00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:53.825\nIt's an interactive site where you\nessentially are able to go and\n\n526\n00:24:53.825 --> 00:24:58.265\nsearch, you could upload suspicious\ncode and have them assess it for you.\n\n527\n00:24:58.265 --> 00:25:00.165\nWe've talked a little about that in CEH,\n\n528\n00:25:00.165 --> 00:25:03.785\nwe talked about writing, malware,\nwriting code, things like that.\n\n529\n00:25:03.785 --> 00:25:06.380\nWe walk you through the logic\nof how to use online sandboxes\n\n530\n00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:08.292\nWhich essentially is what this looks like.\n\n531\n00:25:08.292 --> 00:25:11.660\nDaniel talked about that,\nsome of his malware\n\n532\n00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:14.810\nexploit shows where he's written code and\ndone some of that stuff.\n\n533\n00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:16.160\nHe tends to talk about this kind of stuff.\n\n534\n00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.650\nSo, no it's a great point to make,\nright, that it is integrated,\n\n535\n00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:20.580\nwhich is one of the really cool things.\n\n536\n00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:24.630\nAbout this kind of a tool set which\nis hey, everything is in one place.\n\n537\n00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:28.170\nWhat I like about tools, and\nyou've heard, those of you that have seen\n\n538\n00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:31.710\nepisodes that I've done in the past or\nhave seen me do other shows.\n\n539\n00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:34.410\nYou've heard me on many\noccasions talk about\n\n540\n00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:37.640\ntwo things that I think\nare incredibly valuable about tools.\n\n541\n00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.910\nOne, if they're not free, the fact that\nvendor is willing to go out on a limb,\n\n542\n00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:43.340\ngive you a demo,\ngive you the right to use the tool.\n\n543\n00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:45.630\nAnd we like that,\nwe call that out when we see that.\n\n544\n00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:47.040\nWe talked about that with Nessus, for\n\n545\n00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:50.945\ninstance, the fact that they give you\nthe 14-day or 7-day free trial or\n\n546\n00:25:50.945 --> 00:25:53.740\n14-day trial, depending on what you do so\nyou can get used to the tool.\n\n547\n00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:54.920\nWe like that a lot.\n\n548\n00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.370\nWe also like the fact that\na lot of tools are free.\n\n549\n00:25:57.370 --> 00:26:00.550\nYou know a lot times in our industry,\npeople just overlook the fact that\n\n550\n00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:03.300\nthere are tools out there, although\nthey're free and they may be basic,\n\n551\n00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.710\ndon't have a lot of bells and\nwhistles, right?\n\n552\n00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:07.090\nThey're not shiny and cool.\n\n553\n00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:10.660\n&gt;&gt; Might be a learning curve, it might\nbe not as user-centric or user-friendly.\n\n554\n00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:11.370\n&gt;&gt; They may be.\n\n555\n00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:14.422\nBut the point is they're free and\nthey do the job the same way, right?\n\n556\n00:26:14.422 --> 00:26:16.592\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; My point is, why go out and\n\n557\n00:26:16.592 --> 00:26:18.107\nspend all that money.\n\n558\n00:26:18.107 --> 00:26:19.000\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; I mean, look, I get it.\n\n559\n00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.560\nI mean corporate budgets,\nyou've got money.\n\n560\n00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:23.755\nBoss says, go get me a tool,\nyou go buy a tool.\n\n561\n00:26:23.755 --> 00:26:28.280\nBut, why would you spend X number of\ndollars on something that you could\n\n562\n00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:31.380\nfigure out how to do the same way,\nyou just put a little time, and,\n\n563\n00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:33.910\nas Cherokee said,\na little sweat equity in.\n\n564\n00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:35.520\nFrom my perspective, and\nagain this is just me,\n\n565\n00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:40.670\nI've been doing this a long time, I think\nthere's value in learning how to do that.\n\n566\n00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:44.190\nBecause when that fancy bright shiny\nnew tool doesn't work in the Cloud,\n\n567\n00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:48.040\ncuz you lost connectivity, or something\ngoes wrong, and you gotta figure it out\n\n568\n00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:50.820\non the ground, locally,\ncuz you gotta come up with an answer.\n\n569\n00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:54.310\nYou better have something in your back\npocket, in your toolkit other than yeah,\n\n570\n00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:55.490\nwe don't have Internet connectivity.\n\n571\n00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:57.360\nWhy don't we wait until that gets fixed so\n\n572\n00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.020\nwe can use-\n&gt;&gt; And a lot of times,\n\n573\n00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:00.320\nthat's what you're paying for\nis that customer support, right?\n\n574\n00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:04.970\nTo help you learn that software and\nthen be there for you, kind of\n\n575\n00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.900\nlike as a crutch in case, but that's-\n&gt;&gt; My point is just ultimately that\n\n576\n00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:13.800\nwe don't wanna underestimate\nwhat we tag with the word free.\n\n577\n00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.730\nBecause a lot of times people\nsay you get what you pay for.\n\n578\n00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:17.600\nSo if it's free, how good could it be?\n\n579\n00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:18.850\nWell, I got news for you.\n\n580\n00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:22.110\nSome of the best security tools that\nhave ever been created that to this day\n\n581\n00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:25.980\nare still being used started out as free\ntools that somebody had an idea about.\n\n582\n00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:27.990\nAnd created and said, we should use that.\n\n583\n00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:30.490\nThat's where Nessus came from,\nthat's where Nmap came from,\n\n584\n00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:31.870\nit's where Same came from.\n\n585\n00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:36.060\nIt's where Ethereal, now Wireshark came\nfrom, it's where Etheraid came from,\n\n586\n00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:39.240\nI can go down the list,\nthere's a thousand tools, right?\n\n587\n00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.000\nEvery one of the system turtle\ntools we're showing you are free.\n\n588\n00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.890\nRight, somebody came up with the bright\nidea and said this will be good,\n\n589\n00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:45.940\nwhy don't we do this?\n\n590\n00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:51.300\nSo, a lot of times, those tools are not as\ngood, better than what you're paying for.\n\n591\n00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:52.000\nAnd I want to be clear,\n\n592\n00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.290\nI'm not suggesting that tools you pay for\nare bad, I don't think that at all.\n\n593\n00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:58.360\nI don't think any of the vendors\nthat put their time, energy, and\n\n594\n00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:01.480\nmoney into creating those tools or\ndoing the wrong thing.\n\n595\n00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.130\nIt's just that you don't always have\nto spend money to solve a problem.\n\n596\n00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:06.310\nAnd that's a really important concept for\n\n597\n00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:11.240\nyou, as a security professional, as an\nincident handler, as an IT professional.\n\n598\n00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:13.790\nTo understand, whether you're starting\nout, whether you've been doing this for\n\n599\n00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:14.870\na million years.\n\n600\n00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:15.990\nLike me, right?\n\n601\n00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:17.360\nOr any where in between.\n\n602\n00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:21.380\nBecause sometimes simple is good,\nand simple gets the job done.\n\n603\n00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:23.200\nOther times you need complex, right?\n\n604\n00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:27.110\nAnd you need to have both tools in your\ntoolkit, in order to better understand\n\n605\n00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:30.590\nhow to be a responder, an incident\nresponder, incident management,\n\n606\n00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:34.800\nincident handling that is going to be able\nto deal with any issue, any surprise,\n\n607\n00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.820\nany unknown that you come across.\n\n608\n00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:39.060\nI usually will deploy in\nthe field with three or\n\n609\n00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:41.010\nfour different tools\nthat do the same thing.\n\n610\n00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:44.750\nBecause I know that not every tool\nis gonna work on every system and\n\n611\n00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:46.050\nnot every tool is gonna work every time.\n\n612\n00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:50.230\nAnd if I only have one tool,\nI'm not MacGyver, so if I.\n\n613\n00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:51.630\nIf I don't have more than one tool-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n614\n00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:53.260\n&gt;&gt; I'm not making stuff up as I go,\n\n615\n00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:54.600\nif you get that reference, right?\n\n616\n00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:57.480\nIf you don't,\nhave you seen the new MacGyver show?\n\n617\n00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:59.390\nDo you know they remade it?\n\n618\n00:28:59.390 --> 00:28:59.914\n&gt;&gt; I have not, sorry.\n\n619\n00:28:59.914 --> 00:29:00.570\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You have not, okay.\n\n620\n00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:02.310\nSo, we talk a lot about TV and\nmovies, as you know,\n\n621\n00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:05.490\nsome of you, who have seen my shows\nCherokee is new to this concept.\n\n622\n00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:08.470\nSo she may not have been studying\nenough last and paying attention.\n\n623\n00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:10.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I will leave you,\nyes, disappointed in that.\n\n624\n00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:11.900\n&gt;&gt; But\nare you familiar with the original show?\n\n625\n00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:13.640\n&gt;&gt; Sure, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so they actually have remade it.\n\n626\n00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.050\nOr at least they're\nattempting to remake it.\n\n627\n00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:16.360\nIt's not as good as the original.\n\n628\n00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:17.490\nBut they're actually remaking it now.\n\n629\n00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:19.060\nThere's like a new series out there.\n\n630\n00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:20.550\nAnd that's really the key here Adam,\nright?\n\n631\n00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:24.810\nIs knowing what tools are available, and\nthen in what situation to go ahead and\n\n632\n00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:25.470\nuse those tools.\n\n633\n00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:28.880\nThat's what's gonna make the human aspect,\nmake you special, and\n\n634\n00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.560\ngood at your particular job, right?\n\n635\n00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.082\n&gt;&gt; I like being special and good.\n\n636\n00:29:32.082 --> 00:29:33.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It makes me feel warm and\n\n637\n00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:35.820\nfuzzy inside\n&gt;&gt; I'm all happy.\n\n638\n00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:39.630\nSo we have a couple more tools I\nwanna go through if we could, and\n\n639\n00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:42.562\nthen I know we're getting\nclose to the magic hour.\n\n640\n00:29:42.562 --> 00:29:44.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let me run through these quickly,\n\n641\n00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:46.350\nat least just quickly high-level\ndiscuss what they are.\n\n642\n00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:49.390\nThen you can tell me that we're out\nof time and pull me off stage and\n\n643\n00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:49.910\nwe'll wrap up.\n\n644\n00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:50.720\nHow does that go?\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great.\n\n645\n00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.710\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n&gt;&gt; Could we just go to full screen\n\n646\n00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:54.530\nreal quick, that way I can zip\nthrough a couple of things.\n\n647\n00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:55.200\nThank you, sir.\n\n648\n00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.570\nAll right, so coreinfo,\nlet's just talk about this one.\n\n649\n00:29:57.570 --> 00:29:59.590\nThis one's actually a neat little tool.\n\n650\n00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:03.260\nThis goes through and\nprofiles all of the information,\n\n651\n00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:05.180\nlet me just move this over here,\nwhile we're doing this,\n\n652\n00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:10.060\nall the information on the CPU and\nthe memory allocation in the cores.\n\n653\n00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:12.170\nA lot of times you're\nnot sure what's running,\n\n654\n00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:13.870\nyou're not sure how the system's set up.\n\n655\n00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:16.920\n&gt;&gt; You can't profile the system\nsometimes when it's on, and\n\n656\n00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:18.770\nyou may not understand\nif it's been modified.\n\n657\n00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:22.740\nSo a tool like this will actually\nhelp us to understand that and\n\n658\n00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:27.355\nget a little bit more profile, and\njust a layout of not only the memory, but\n\n659\n00:30:27.355 --> 00:30:29.895\nthe process or\narchitecture which can be valuable.\n\n660\n00:30:29.895 --> 00:30:33.445\nWe've got listdll.64, you can\nprobably tell what that does, right,\n\n661\n00:30:33.445 --> 00:30:39.055\nlists all our dlls, logon sessions 64 or\n32 does all the logon sessions.\n\n662\n00:30:39.055 --> 00:30:42.072\nSee a lot of time you may,\nespecially in Windows systems.\n\n663\n00:30:42.072 --> 00:30:45.152\nYou have the ability to be able to\nhave a user logged on and switch.\n\n664\n00:30:45.152 --> 00:30:47.872\nYou could switch live right between\nthe users, and have essentially,\n\n665\n00:30:47.872 --> 00:30:49.032\nanother session running.\n\n666\n00:30:49.032 --> 00:30:51.182\nAnd you may not realize when\nyou walk up to a machine,\n\n667\n00:30:51.182 --> 00:30:53.032\nthere's more than one user logged in.\n\n668\n00:30:53.032 --> 00:30:56.602\nThis tool, will pull down that\ninformation, and tell you hey,\n\n669\n00:30:56.602 --> 00:30:59.562\nthere's a session for Cherokee,\nand one for Adam on this machine,\n\n670\n00:30:59.562 --> 00:31:02.452\neven though you're only logged\non right now, and seeing one.\n\n671\n00:31:02.452 --> 00:31:05.520\nYou will then actually have a no\nHave an ability to know that.\n\n672\n00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:08.880\nAnd that's so critical with regards\nto forensic examination and\n\n673\n00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.330\ngathering the volatile evidence.\n\n674\n00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:14.480\nBecause if we shut the machine down and\nonly gather the current logon session.\n\n675\n00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:17.890\nAnd we don't gather, let's say your\nsession if you're the alternate user,\n\n676\n00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:19.270\nI've lost all that data, right?\n\n677\n00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:20.630\nI have no way of knowing it's there.\n\n678\n00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:24.140\nSo this tool, if we run it, will actually\ngive you a list, so it's kind of nice.\n\n679\n00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:26.300\nWe have the PS series of tools.\n\n680\n00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:28.560\nThere's a whole bunch, PS info, PS lists-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n681\n00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:29.920\nthat's gonna be referencing\nthe process list?\n\n682\n00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:31.000\n&gt;&gt; Those are the process list.\n\n683\n00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.010\nYes, exactly.\nSo process info, process list.\n\n684\n00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:37.150\nThis is essentially like Task Manager,\nbut on steroids.\n\n685\n00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:41.710\nIt's gonna give us more like what top or\nproc or list does in Linux/Unix, which is\n\n686\n00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:45.630\na very complete and very full listing of\nall the attributes of the processes, not\n\n687\n00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:49.230\nthe three or four things we tend to see in\nTask Manager, right, more often than not.\n\n688\n00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:50.859\nSo we've got those.\n\n689\n00:31:50.859 --> 00:31:56.210\nWe've got RAMMap, which actually is,\nalso with VMMap, a very cool set of tools.\n\n690\n00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:58.301\nThese map the actual live\nmemory of a process and\n\n691\n00:31:58.301 --> 00:31:59.929\nshow you what's happening with it.\n\n692\n00:31:59.929 --> 00:32:02.510\nI'm gonna demo one of those for\nyou in just a minute.\n\n693\n00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:04.770\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; And then we have tcpview,\n\n694\n00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:07.420\nwhich really just does\nthe networking information,\n\n695\n00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:09.110\nshows us what's going on\nwith the network stack.\n\n696\n00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:10.170\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So all that stuff,\n\n697\n00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:12.220\nalmost like a network monitor.\n\n698\n00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:13.560\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But with a little bit of a different\n\n699\n00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:14.420\nfocus, right?\n\n700\n00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:17.600\nSo let's take a look at rammap real quick.\n\n701\n00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:18.940\nAnd just see what this does.\n\n702\n00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:22.290\nSo rammap and that's one of those\nfunny ones that has two m's so\n\n703\n00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:23.690\nyou gotta spell it the right way.\n\n704\n00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:26.750\nAll right, so when you do rammap,\nyou'll see it comes up.\n\n705\n00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:29.850\nCan we go full screen just to see\nthis a little bit easier to see?\n\n706\n00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:32.230\nSo when we go in,\nyou'll see we have use counts,\n\n707\n00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:35.310\nwe have processes,\npriority summary, physical pages.\n\n708\n00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:36.350\nThese are all tabs, right,\n\n709\n00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:38.930\nand everything's color coded\nin the ram stack here.\n\n710\n00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:43.270\nAnd it's broken out, so we can see what\nprocesses are running that are private and\n\n711\n00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:45.050\nhow much memory they're taking, right?\n\n712\n00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:49.800\nAnd we can go in and we can see what's\nkind of set up and what individual just\n\n713\n00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:52.470\nwant me to click here,\nwhat all the individual processes are.\n\n714\n00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:54.730\nWe see the PIDs, so we see the process ID.\n\n715\n00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:56.530\nWe see the memory breakdown.\n\n716\n00:32:56.530 --> 00:32:57.700\nWe can also go in.\n\n717\n00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:59.270\nWe can see the physical range of memory.\n\n718\n00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:01.280\nSo we can see the memory map.\n\n719\n00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.260\nWe can see a file summary of\neverything that is running.\n\n720\n00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:08.250\nThen we can open up and\nwe can see file details,\n\n721\n00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:12.340\nwe have to scroll of course, but\nwe can see the actual memory map and and\n\n722\n00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:16.950\nwhat memory is being used and, you know,\nis it in stand by, is it active.\n\n723\n00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:22.240\nSo we can actually drill through and\nin real time without doing a full.\n\n724\n00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.800\nOffline memory dump,\nlook at memory in real time.\n\n725\n00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.810\nNow, this is not gonna give us\ndetailed information about what\n\n726\n00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:29.630\nis in a certain sector of memory.\n\n727\n00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:31.990\nBut, it's gonna tell us\nwhat's attached to memory.\n\n728\n00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:34.450\nSo that, we can, other words, understand\nwhat's using what area of memory.\n\n729\n00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:35.690\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; You can think of it that way, right.\n\n730\n00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:36.960\n&gt;&gt; So,\nwhat we might be able to identify, and\n\n731\n00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:41.310\nkind of arbitrary programs that\nare using like for a memory buffer for\n\n732\n00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:43.530\nlike attacks or anything like\nthat with this particular tool.\n\n733\n00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:46.220\n&gt;&gt; We would have a chance of at\nleast seeing what's active and\n\n734\n00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:49.720\nthen using some other tools along with\nthat to be able to zero on the exact thing\n\n735\n00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:50.320\nyou were talking about.\n\n736\n00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:55.370\nSo either a buffer overflow or\nsome sort of a in-memory attack what we're\n\n737\n00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:58.130\ntrying to jump from one memory\nstream to another, right?\n\n738\n00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:01.990\nSo we were breaking isolation maybe in\nthe VM containment area, so virtual\n\n739\n00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:05.370\nmachine attacks are often propagated\nby trying to attach to the memory and\n\n740\n00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:09.020\njump between memory sectors, so\nthat could be something we would see.\n\n741\n00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:10.630\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; Speaking of virtual machines, so\n\n742\n00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:14.260\nlet's look at the virtual version of this,\nwhich is the vmap, right.\n\n743\n00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:18.890\nSo you can see here vmap or vmmap,\nwhich is going to be virtual memory map.\n\n744\n00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:22.050\nSo let's just take a look at that one,\nlet me just scroll down here and\n\n745\n00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:23.150\nwe'll finish up with that.\n\n746\n00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:29.230\nSo when we do virtual machine memory,\nwe select or launch a process,\n\n747\n00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:34.060\nso let's take a look at Chrome.exe and\nthen it will allow us,\n\n748\n00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:36.780\nand we can go back in and\nchange the process map, but\n\n749\n00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:41.410\nit allows us to drill down as you can\nsee and look at the virtual memory map.\n\n750\n00:34:41.410 --> 00:34:44.450\nSo if we're running,\neither through a page file or\n\n751\n00:34:44.450 --> 00:34:48.740\na virtual memory allocation of some kind\nas we often do on systems, we're gonna\n\n752\n00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:52.440\nread what's in the virtual memory buffers,\nnot just what's actually a live round.\n\n753\n00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.760\nSo we're seeing two\nsides of the same coin.\n\n754\n00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.580\nBut again, this is something\nthat from a forensic standpoint,\n\n755\n00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:59.810\npeople don't often remember and\nthink about.\n\n756\n00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:02.990\nWe have physical memory, but\nwe also have virtual memory in there.\n\n757\n00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:04.410\nAnd I'm not talking\nabout virtual machines.\n\n758\n00:35:04.410 --> 00:35:09.350\nTell you about physical or virtual,\nboth machines use both physical RAM, but\n\n759\n00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:12.050\nalso use a paging solution or\n\n760\n00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:16.000\na swap-file, it's referred to different\nways, and that is virtual memory.\n\n761\n00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.740\nAnd we have to understand that there's\nessentially stuff written in the hard\n\n762\n00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:21.370\ndrive that is also part of the memory\npath, and that's what we're seeing here.\n\n763\n00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:24.540\n&gt;&gt; All right, it looks like we've\nmade it through the end of our list.\n\n764\n00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:25.910\nAre we finished here, Adam?\n\n765\n00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:26.690\n&gt;&gt; We are.\n\n766\n00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:28.410\nLet's just make sure\neverybody can see the list so\n\n767\n00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:30.190\nif they wanna go back,\nthey can take a look.\n\n768\n00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:32.040\nSome of the ones we didn't\ngo a chance to go through.\n\n769\n00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:34.620\nBut you can see that this is\na small sampling of the tools.\n\n770\n00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:36.700\n&gt;&gt; Plus you also listed some in\nthe show notes, as well, so.\n\n771\n00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:40.433\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well we did list separate ones,\nnot part of sys internal's toolset.\n\n772\n00:35:40.433 --> 00:35:42.350\nThose are more Linux tools primarily, so\n\n773\n00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:45.420\nit's kind of the alter ego of\nthis toolset on the Linux side.\n\n774\n00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:47.980\nBut there is a list, and definitely want\nto remind you to take a look at that.\n\n775\n00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:50.798\nBut just keep in mind,\nthere's probably another 30 or\n\n776\n00:35:50.798 --> 00:35:54.740\n40 tools in this sys internals tool set\noverall that are actually available.\n\n777\n00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:56.930\nYou would just have to go in and\nplay with them.\n\n778\n00:35:56.930 --> 00:36:00.005\nAnd if you want, just to have a quick idea\n\n779\n00:36:00.005 --> 00:36:04.595\nyou can see here this is the entire\nlisting just as I scroll down.\n\n780\n00:36:04.595 --> 00:36:09.335\nThese are all the tools and the associated\nhelp files that go with them\n\n781\n00:36:09.335 --> 00:36:12.587\nwhen you download the 21, 22 megabytes of\nstuff that's what you get right there.\n\n782\n00:36:12.587 --> 00:36:15.787\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for introducing us\nto these free but wonderful tools.\n\n783\n00:36:15.787 --> 00:36:18.027\nI think we have a lot of\nhomework ahead of us now.\n\n784\n00:36:18.027 --> 00:36:20.097\nBut that's about it for\nthis particular show.\n\n785\n00:36:20.097 --> 00:36:22.497\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nsign off as your show host.\n\n786\n00:36:22.497 --> 00:36:23.947\nI'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n787\n00:36:23.947 --> 00:36:25.017\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n788\n00:36:25.017 --> 00:36:26.850\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n789\n00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:27.836\n&gt;&gt; Take care, everybody.\n\n790\n00:36:27.836 --> 00:36:33.842\n[MUSIC]\n\n791\n00:36:33.842 --> 00:36:35.660\nThank you for watching

00:00:12.067\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.067 --> 00:00:13.684\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your ECIH series.\n\n5\n00:00:13.684 --> 00:00:14.370\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.130\nAll right, so\nlet's think about this for a second.\n\n7\n00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.010\nAn incident has just occurred.\n\n8\n00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.910\nWell, who should be\nreporting the incident, and\n\n9\n00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.470\nwhat should they be reporting?\n\n10\n00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.890\nWell, with us today we have Mr.\n\n11\n00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.640\nAdam Gordon to help us through these\ntopics and explain all these issues.\n\n12\n00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.240\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n13\n00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.121\n&gt;&gt; You are just too kind, Cherokee.\n\n14\n00:00:34.121 --> 00:00:35.294\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you are so nice,\n\n15\n00:00:35.294 --> 00:00:37.390\nshe's always saying please and thank you.\n\n16\n00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.050\nYou never hear a bad word\ncome out of her mouth.\n\n17\n00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.803\nShe's always smiling.\n\n18\n00:00:40.803 --> 00:00:42.936\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's just so nice, so nice.\n\n19\n00:00:42.936 --> 00:00:45.730\nAll right, so I am happy to be here,\nhopefully you are as well.\n\n20\n00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:46.571\nWe know Cherokee is.\n\n21\n00:00:46.571 --> 00:00:48.587\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We've established that already beyond\n\n22\n00:00:48.587 --> 00:00:52.105\na reasonable doubt, so we're gonna\ntalk a bit about incident responding.\n\n23\n00:00:52.105 --> 00:00:55.315\nWhat do incident responders do,\nhow do they do it, right?\n\n24\n00:00:55.315 --> 00:00:57.425\nCherokee and\nI were chatting before we came on,\n\n25\n00:00:57.425 --> 00:01:00.025\nwhat's an incident responder\ngonna do when they show up?\n\n26\n00:01:00.025 --> 00:01:00.715\nWhat do they report?\n\n27\n00:01:00.715 --> 00:01:01.955\nWhat are they supposed to be aware of?\n\n28\n00:01:01.955 --> 00:01:03.270\nThese are things.\n\n29\n00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.080\nThat as incident handlers, incident\nresponders, incident managers, IT security\n\n30\n00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.640\nprofessionals, IT professionals,\nnetwork admins, a lot of times.\n\n31\n00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.430\nEither we have questions about,\nwanna know more about.\n\n32\n00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.560\nWe may not understand in\ncertain situations what to do.\n\n33\n00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.140\nIn others, it may be self-evident.\n\n34\n00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.820\nWell, I showed up and\nthere was a big skull and\n\n35\n00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.505\ncrossbones flashing on the screen.\n\n36\n00:01:23.505 --> 00:01:24.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Think there was something wrong with\n\n37\n00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.440\nthat machine, right?\n\n38\n00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.550\nWhereas other times, they show up and\nit looks normal, right?\n\n39\n00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.990\nI mean, just Windows desktop,\nLinux desktop.\n\n40\n00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.210\nEverything looks good, but yet there's a\nrootkit or malware lurking underneath and\n\n41\n00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.130\nwe're just not aware of that.\n\n42\n00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.430\nWe did a whole episode and demonstration\nin that episode if you remember\n\n43\n00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.540\non insider threats, and we took a look\nat keyloggers, pretty cool episode.\n\n44\n00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.410\nIf you haven't seen it, definitely invite\nyou go back take a look I did a whole demo\n\n45\n00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.640\non what a key logger could do and\nhow we solve the keyloggers, but\n\n46\n00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.040\nalso how we detect them using\nanti-key logger technology, right.\n\n47\n00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.440\nSo, for every problem,\nthere is a solution as we say, right.\n\n48\n00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.415\nSo the reality is, The part we don't tell\nyou is the people that write the key\n\n49\n00:02:01.415 --> 00:02:04.275\nlogger software are the same people who\nwrite the anti-key logger software.\n\n50\n00:02:04.275 --> 00:02:05.105\nBut we don't tell you that.\n\n51\n00:02:05.105 --> 00:02:06.555\nYou're not supposed to know that.\n\n52\n00:02:06.555 --> 00:02:10.845\nSo the reality is ultimately that\nthere are so many different things.\n\n53\n00:02:10.845 --> 00:02:13.125\nThere is a kinda of a thought process,\nright?\n\n54\n00:02:13.125 --> 00:02:15.885\nHey, we should know these things and\nreport these things kinda list.\n\n55\n00:02:15.885 --> 00:02:17.725\nAnd we're gonna go through\nthat in just a second.\n\n56\n00:02:17.725 --> 00:02:22.210\nBut there's so many variables, so\nmany differences and subtleties.\n\n57\n00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.780\nIn every incident that we face.\n\n58\n00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.480\nIn the over 30 years I've been doing this,\n\n59\n00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.350\nright, I can't tell you the number\nof times that I've come up to, or\n\n60\n00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.630\ncome upon an incident scene that I've\nbeen asked to deal with as part of either\n\n61\n00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.875\na response team, a cert,\na C cert, whatever it may be.\n\n62\n00:02:38.875 --> 00:02:43.600\nAnd/or as an auditor Having to look\nat a system as a forensic examiner,\n\n63\n00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.590\nhaving to look at a system,\nyou are just being a first responder.\n\n64\n00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.400\nJust being the person on the scene\nthat happens to discover that\n\n65\n00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.570\nsomething's gone wrong.\n\n66\n00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.870\nAnyway all these things are gonna happen\nto you over time if you do this long\n\n67\n00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.950\nenough and while there are similarities,\nright almost for that exception all of\n\n68\n00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.430\nthem involve computers that we are talking\nabout computer related incidents in\n\n69\n00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.080\nsecurity breaches so there's a commonality\nthere but are all computers the same?\n\n70\n00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.150\nNot really.\n\n71\n00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.160\nI mean, just look at our desktop as\nwe're presenting to you here, right?\n\n72\n00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.980\nGot an Apple machine, got a couple\nof Wintel, Intel kinda clones.\n\n73\n00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.780\nBoth are Dells, right?\n\n74\n00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.220\nBut there's subtlety and\nvariety in that makeup.\n\n75\n00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.230\nWhat OS are you running\non that monstrously large\n\n76\n00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.900\ntable weight that you've\ngot going on over there?\n\n77\n00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:25.400\n&gt;&gt; Windows 10.\n\n78\n00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.540\n&gt;&gt; You got Windows 10, right?\n\n79\n00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.670\nOkay, so I'm old.\n\n80\n00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.060\nI'm running Windows 7, right,\n\n81\n00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.315\non my My piece of junk here is being\nheld by electrical tape on the corner.\n\n82\n00:03:33.315 --> 00:03:35.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] He's not kidding.\n\n83\n00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.610\n&gt;&gt; I'm not kidding.\n\n84\n00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.140\nI point it out in most shows.\n\n85\n00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.650\nIf you actually see it I've got a big\npiece of electrical tape sitting on\n\n86\n00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.690\nthe corner where I dropped it and\nit cracked up.\n\n87\n00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.240\nBut this machine's been all over the world\nwith me, you just can't kill this thing.\n\n88\n00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.020\nThey had this thing\nprobably about seven years.\n\n89\n00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.850\nAnd-\n&gt;&gt; I know, they make\n\n90\n00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:48.950\nfun of me for having this.\n\n91\n00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.910\nBut this is actually my\nthird as they progress-\n\n92\n00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:52.430\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n93\n00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.930\n&gt;&gt; I've been given the same series.\n\n94\n00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.602\n&gt;&gt; So\njust a continuously larger version of it.\n\n95\n00:03:56.602 --> 00:03:58.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because you can feed and\n\n96\n00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.700\nhouse a family of four.\n\n97\n00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.090\n&gt;&gt; I know,\nthat's what they make fun of me about.\n\n98\n00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.250\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty big\n&gt;&gt; But whatever it may be, right?\n\n99\n00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.870\nOn the Apple machine\nI've got running here,\n\n100\n00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.400\nwe're running whatever the latest\nBuild the Mac OS X would be, but\n\n101\n00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.330\nwe're running bootcamps\nyou see in other episodes.\n\n102\n00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.130\nSo essentially a virtualization platform\nSimilar to parallels, for instance.\n\n103\n00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.130\nYou could run a WinTel desktop.\n\n104\n00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.860\nI've got a Windows 10 machine running as\nthe core base that I'm demoing out of, and\n\n105\n00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.740\nthen I remote into another set of virtual\nmachines that are running a variety\n\n106\n00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.710\nof OSs, right?\n\n107\n00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.300\n&gt;&gt; So if I had to deal with instant\nresponse in this little network/enclave\n\n108\n00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.260\nhere I'd have to have skills spanning\nmultiple operating systems, right?\n\n109\n00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Different platforms,\n\n110\n00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.780\ndifferent hardware or thought processes\nbecause the hardware on the Macintosh side\n\n111\n00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.740\nis different than the hardware\non the [INAUDIBLE] side.\n\n112\n00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.170\nIn the sense that we have hard drives.\n\n113\n00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.590\nHard drive is essentially a hard drive.\n\n114\n00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.700\nWe've got memory it's essentially memory.\n\n115\n00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.810\nBut it's made by a different\ncompany typically.\n\n116\n00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.120\nIt may be configured and\nmanaged differently.\n\n117\n00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.780\nIndeed it is as we know.\n\n118\n00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.030\nAnd as a result things are gonna look and\nfeel, and\n\n119\n00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.430\nhave to be dealt with from\na slightly different perspective.\n\n120\n00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.010\nAnd as incident responders, one of\nthe most important things we can do, is be\n\n121\n00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:13.370\nopen to the fact that there are things\nthat we have to Understand and ascertain\n\n122\n00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.130\nas opposed to assume and then operate\non that assumption because when and\n\n123\n00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:24.216\nyou probably know the right.When we assume\nright,we make,you can fill in the blank.\n\n124\n00:05:24.216 --> 00:05:24.746\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n125\n00:05:24.746 --> 00:05:26.930\n&gt;&gt; We make mistakes that\nwhat I was gonna say.\n\n126\n00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.780\nRight, we make fools of ourselves, right.\n\n127\n00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.580\nBecause the problem is that we\noperate from the position and\n\n128\n00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.900\nthe thought process, the point of\nknowledge, the inflection point,\n\n129\n00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.140\nthat unfortunately is not always accurate.\n\n130\n00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.690\nBecause we don't tend to look\nat what's going on around us,\n\n131\n00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.020\nwe think we know everything,\nor we know better, right.\n\n132\n00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.590\nAnd as a result we overlook things,\n\n133\n00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.930\nthat's one of the biggest mistakes\nincident responders can make And\n\n134\n00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.840\nas we're generating these reports,\nwe really do wanna remain objective.\n\n135\n00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.290\nBecause ultimately, we can't\n\n136\n00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:58.930\nreally always foresee if this case is\ngoing to litigation or anything like that,\n\n137\n00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.200\nand we wanna stay objective so\nthat we can present this information And\n\n138\n00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.780\nnot have it thrown out because it is\none sided or something like that.\n\n139\n00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.940\n&gt;&gt; It's a very good point\nthat Cherokee's making.\n\n140\n00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.420\nYeah, we don't, and we actually,\nI'll even take it a step further.\n\n141\n00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:12.440\nI love what she just said.\n\n142\n00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.450\nI think it's 100% accurate.\n\n143\n00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.110\nBut let's make it even more impactful.\n\n144\n00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.210\nIt's not that we don't know.\n\n145\n00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.540\nWhat we actually need to do is\nassume with every case we deal with.\n\n146\n00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.770\nEvery incident that we respond to,\neverything we do that it will wind up,\n\n147\n00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:25.400\nright, in a court.\n\n148\n00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.040\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Because potentially\n\n149\n00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.670\n&gt;&gt; He can't and\n\n150\n00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.050\nI'm not saying everyone will, right?\n\n151\n00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.640\nThe majority of them don't let's be\nhonest but if we were to assume and\n\n152\n00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.640\nmake a mistake and say,\nwell this one won't, this one will and\n\n153\n00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.200\nwe treated them differently,\nwe wouldn't meet the bar and\n\n154\n00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.590\nthe expectation for\nhow we present evidence.\n\n155\n00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:45.450\nHow we gather it, how we prepare and\nit's better to be more thorough and\n\n156\n00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:50.210\nforensically sound, even with something\nminor and over essentially, right,\n\n157\n00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.830\ndeal with those issues by over\ncompensating them, making sure that\n\n158\n00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.900\nthey've done the right way because then if\nit doesn't show up in the court of law,\n\n159\n00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.640\nokay no big deal, we spent time, did the\nright way, took a little longer but guess\n\n160\n00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.320\nwhat, if we ever have to go back to it, we\nknow it's gonna be able to depressant it,\n\n161\n00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.850\nif we don't As we said,\nessentially we blew it, right?\n\n162\n00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.620\nYou get one chance, and if you don't\nget it right, like in Microsoft,\n\n163\n00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.150\nthere's no oops, undo,\nI didn't mean to do that button.\n\n164\n00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:17.425\nLike, can I go back and capture bad guy\nagain, and this time actually be serious?\n\n165\n00:07:17.425 --> 00:07:18.555\nThat just, that doesn't work, right?\n\n166\n00:07:18.555 --> 00:07:21.045\nI mean, it'd be cool if it did,\nbut it doesn't.\n\n167\n00:07:21.045 --> 00:07:24.545\nYou do it right or, you know,\nas my grandfather used to say,\n\n168\n00:07:24.545 --> 00:07:26.885\nthings that are worth doing,\nright, are worth doing right.\n\n169\n00:07:26.885 --> 00:07:28.325\nIf you don't do them\nright the first time--\n\n170\n00:07:28.325 --> 00:07:28.865\n&gt;&gt; Don't do them at all.\n\n171\n00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:30.145\n&gt;&gt; You shouldn't be doing them at all,\nright?\n\n172\n00:07:30.145 --> 00:07:32.537\nExactly.\nAnd, you know, if you are,\n\n173\n00:07:32.537 --> 00:07:35.177\nand you whoever is watching right now,\n\n174\n00:07:35.177 --> 00:07:39.185\nwhoever is consuming this\ninformation over time, right.\n\n175\n00:07:39.185 --> 00:07:43.037\nYou need to assess yourself, and\nyou are the best judge Of your character,\n\n176\n00:07:43.037 --> 00:07:45.435\nyour personality, your abilities, right?\n\n177\n00:07:45.435 --> 00:07:48.524\nIf you're not one of those\npeople that's meticulous,\n\n178\n00:07:48.524 --> 00:07:51.415\nif you're not one of those\npeople that's patient,\n\n179\n00:07:51.415 --> 00:07:55.556\nif you're not one of those people that\nunderstands the value of process and\n\n180\n00:07:55.556 --> 00:07:59.725\ninstead and listen there's nothing\nwrong with being that kind of person.\n\n181\n00:07:59.725 --> 00:08:02.274\nThere's also nothing wrong with\nbeing opposite kind of person.\n\n182\n00:08:02.274 --> 00:08:03.511\nIt's takes all types, right?\n\n183\n00:08:03.511 --> 00:08:06.662\nAnd we have to have all types to\nbe able to do all sort of stuff.\n\n184\n00:08:06.662 --> 00:08:11.325\nBut if you're the person that can't follow\nprocedure, that doesn't like rules,\n\n185\n00:08:11.325 --> 00:08:13.500\nthat doesn't [CROSSTALK] get the idea.\n\n186\n00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.165\nYou shouldn't be doing this,\nis all I'm saying, right?\n\n187\n00:08:16.165 --> 00:08:19.075\nDifferent career path for you,\ngot a lot of other things for you to do,\n\n188\n00:08:19.075 --> 00:08:20.175\nit's not gonna be this.\n\n189\n00:08:20.175 --> 00:08:23.805\n&gt;&gt; I know, I actually worked as\na curator for an art gallery.\n\n190\n00:08:23.805 --> 00:08:26.597\nAnd sometimes I would try to\narrange artists to show up for\n\n191\n00:08:26.597 --> 00:08:28.821\na particular events, promotional things.\n\n192\n00:08:28.821 --> 00:08:31.685\nAnd I couldn't even get a hold of people\nsometimes, I'm like, where have you been?\n\n193\n00:08:31.685 --> 00:08:32.851\nI've been trying to get a hold of you for\ntwo weeks.\n\n194\n00:08:32.851 --> 00:08:37.550\nAnd they're like I've been sitting down by\nthe river, finding nature, and all this.\n\n195\n00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:42.203\nAnd I'm just like, yeah, [LAUGH] I'm\ndefinitely in this kind of category.\n\n196\n00:08:42.203 --> 00:08:45.840\nAnd some people, like you said, it's just\ncompletely different personalities and\n\n197\n00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.320\nhow they handle things.\n\n198\n00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:51.129\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so, if you are type A,\nthen this is for you, right?\n\n199\n00:08:51.129 --> 00:08:53.885\nBecause you're gonna have that focus,\nyou're gonna be,\n\n200\n00:08:53.885 --> 00:08:56.805\nessentially, just conceptually\nable to put things in a box and\n\n201\n00:08:56.805 --> 00:08:59.090\nunderstand that that's how you do them.\n\n202\n00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:03.530\nIf you're more that laidback nature\nseeker that Cherokee was just describing.\n\n203\n00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:06.146\nAnd I, as I've shared with\nyou in some episodes before,\n\n204\n00:09:06.146 --> 00:09:08.060\nI have two lovely daughters.\n\n205\n00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:12.349\nAnd both absolutely fabulous people and\nbeautiful young ladies, but\n\n206\n00:09:12.349 --> 00:09:16.890\nincredibly and startling different\nfrom personality perspective.\n\n207\n00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.450\nAs many children are,\nif you have kids, you know.\n\n208\n00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:23.110\nThere's a composite make up of their\nparents but they vary greatly.\n\n209\n00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:26.210\nAnd yet in many ways, they're\nmirror images of us and what we do.\n\n210\n00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:31.020\nSo you have to understand that if you just\ncannot bring yourself to follow rules and\n\n211\n00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:31.794\nbe patient.\n\n212\n00:09:31.794 --> 00:09:35.621\nAll kidding aside, this is just\nnot a good career path for you.\n\n213\n00:09:35.621 --> 00:09:39.736\nBecause you're gonna have to do that\nnonstop, without fail, strictly,\n\n214\n00:09:39.736 --> 00:09:43.671\nevery time you show up and put on your\ngame face to do incident response.\n\n215\n00:09:43.671 --> 00:09:48.024\nBecause if you drop the ball and\neven the most minute thing is not\n\n216\n00:09:48.024 --> 00:09:51.569\ndone according to the standard and\nthe procedure.\n\n217\n00:09:51.569 --> 00:09:55.970\nThat's grounds for dismissal when we look\nat that evidence critically later on.\n\n218\n00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:59.620\nWe may not find that out till three, four,\nfive steps in the road at some point.\n\n219\n00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:03.650\nBut if, as Cherokee suggested, this thing\nshows up in a court of law at some point.\n\n220\n00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:05.140\n&gt;&gt; And I have to testify.\n\n221\n00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:07.440\n&gt;&gt; And you may be an expert witness.\n\n222\n00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.470\n&gt;&gt; Okay, expert witness.\n\n223\n00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:12.270\nThe other counsel will probably try to\ndiscredit me in multiple ways, right?\n\n224\n00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:13.440\n&gt;&gt; Not even try, they will, right?\n\n225\n00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.280\nThere's no doubt about it.\n\n226\n00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.890\nThere's no try or try not, right?\n\n227\n00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:20.962\nAs Yoda said, do or do not,\nthere is no try, right?\n\n228\n00:10:20.962 --> 00:10:25.040\nI mean, it's very simple, words of\nwisdom from somebody this big, right?\n\n229\n00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:29.490\nSo either you do it or you don't, because\nif you try to do it and screw it up,\n\n230\n00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:33.500\nthat prosecuting attorney or the defense,\ndepending on what side you may be on.\n\n231\n00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:37.820\nThat other opposing party,\nbefore it ever gets to trial in discovery,\n\n232\n00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.570\nis gonna know that you screwed up and\ndid not follow procedure.\n\n233\n00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:42.860\nAnd you're never ever gonna\nget out of the gate with this.\n\n234\n00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.400\nI mean, you're done before you start,\nessentially, is what happens.\n\n235\n00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.090\nSo having said that,\nlet's talk about what starting and\n\n236\n00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:50.540\nbeing done actually looks like.\n\n237\n00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:52.310\nI love when that works the right way.\n\n238\n00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:54.290\nAll right, so,\nI charge my finger overnight.\n\n239\n00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.310\nI plugged it in,\nmade sure I had plenty of power.\n\n240\n00:10:56.310 --> 00:11:00.080\nBecause last time I did this in\nthe other show, we were a little slow,\n\n241\n00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.120\ndidn't come right up.\n\n242\n00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.976\nBecause my finger was not\nrunning at full capacity.\n\n243\n00:11:02.976 --> 00:11:06.209\nAll right, so we have up here just\nsome things that we wanna make\n\n244\n00:11:06.209 --> 00:11:08.090\nsure we can go through with you.\n\n245\n00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:10.950\nYou know when there's a long enough\nlist while I could rattle this\n\n246\n00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:12.610\nthing off verbally and give it to you.\n\n247\n00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:15.310\nIt's hard, I know, for\nyou guys to keep track of, it's hard for\n\n248\n00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:19.180\nus to keep track of and-\n&gt;&gt; You could even screenshot this and\n\n249\n00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:20.681\nput it in your notes.\n\n250\n00:11:20.681 --> 00:11:22.510\n&gt;&gt; We could, absolutely, and\nthey are in the show notes, right?\n\n251\n00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:23.026\n&gt;&gt; So no need.\n\n252\n00:11:23.026 --> 00:11:24.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you will be able to\nsee them in the show notes.\n\n253\n00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:27.441\nBut if you want to take a picture,\nI'll do one and wait, let me go.\n\n254\n00:11:27.441 --> 00:11:28.190\n&gt;&gt; Ta da!\n[LAUGH]\n\n255\n00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:30.330\n&gt;&gt; I'll do this and\n\n256\n00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:31.780\nyou can screenshot the whole thing.\n\n257\n00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:36.455\nI'll even Autograph it for you and\nyou could as well, if you'd like.\n\n258\n00:11:36.455 --> 00:11:39.250\n$5 in the lobby after the show,\nas many as you would like.\n\n259\n00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:40.660\nWe have a 3 for 5 sale.\n\n260\n00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:43.190\nYou can buy 3 and\nit will cost you $5 each.\n\n261\n00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:46.080\nOkay, so the details to be reported\nat the time of the breach are.\n\n262\n00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.970\nSo this is the kinda list, right,\nagain, that Cherokee was pointing out,\n\n263\n00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:53.100\nwas thinking about, was talking\nabout as we opened up the show.\n\n264\n00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.360\nAnd she was saying, hey,\nis there a methodology?\n\n265\n00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.420\nAre there steps, what do we do?\n\n266\n00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.000\nHow do we know what do we put out there?\n\n267\n00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.560\nThere definitely is, but as I've stressed\nbefore and talked about with you before,\n\n268\n00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.810\nwhile there is kind of a baseline,\na minimum, hey, this is acceptable.\n\n269\n00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:08.430\nIt's a standard kind of thing.\n\n270\n00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:12.120\nDo you report every one of these\nthings every time without fail?\n\n271\n00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.460\nWe'd like to see all this stuff,\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n272\n00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:19.895\nBut there may be stuff on\nhere that is circumstantial.\n\n273\n00:12:19.895 --> 00:12:22.470\nThere may be stuff on here that is\ncontextual to the certain event.\n\n274\n00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:24.897\nAnd you may have more detail in\nsome areas and less in others,\n\n275\n00:12:24.897 --> 00:12:26.630\ndepending on the kind of event.\n\n276\n00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:29.088\nSo there's no right and\nwrong in most things.\n\n277\n00:12:29.088 --> 00:12:33.350\nIn this case, as you've often heard\nme say, showing up and doing it and\n\n278\n00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:35.610\nlocalizing and\nmaking it you're own is important.\n\n279\n00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:38.370\nBut in this particular case,\nthere is a right and wrong.\n\n280\n00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:42.280\nThere is a minimum expectation\nof what has to be reported.\n\n281\n00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.750\nAnd we do need to know these\nthings because if we don't,\n\n282\n00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:47.030\nwe're just not telling a complete and\naccurate story.\n\n283\n00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:49.930\nAnd it's not like we get to keep\ngoing back and adding more detail.\n\n284\n00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:52.360\nWe gotta really lay it all out there and\nunderstand it.\n\n285\n00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.240\nBecause we get one chance at gathering\nthis stuff at the point of connection,\n\n286\n00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.220\nat the point of interaction.\n\n287\n00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.320\nWhen we are on scene,\ndoing the initial assessment,\n\n288\n00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.680\nthe triage, the evidence collection.\n\n289\n00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.210\nWe can always go back\nto the evidence later.\n\n290\n00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:08.570\nYou see that in crime dramas and\nmovies all the time, right?\n\n291\n00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:11.980\nThey pull it out of a box and\nthey always examine it after the fact.\n\n292\n00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:15.900\nAnd I'm not suggesting you can't do that,\nbut what I'm suggesting is then.\n\n293\n00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:20.375\nWhen you do that, it's usually more\ndifficult to understand these things\n\n294\n00:13:20.375 --> 00:13:24.260\nthan when you capture them at the initial\npoint when they're all laid out, right and\n\n295\n00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.465\nyour kinda there and\nyour interacting with them in one place.\n\n296\n00:13:26.465 --> 00:13:30.642\nCuz if you have to put back together 10 or\n15 pieces of evidence in a certain\n\n297\n00:13:30.642 --> 00:13:34.706\norder and kinda lay them out in a certain\nway to reproduce that crime scene.\n\n298\n00:13:34.706 --> 00:13:39.428\nIt's a lot more convoluted and complicated\nto get all that done six months later.\n\n299\n00:13:39.428 --> 00:13:42.160\nAnd go off notes and pictures, and\nmake sure everything's identical,\n\n300\n00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.880\nwhen you got it all sitting there in\nfront of you the first time, right?\n\n301\n00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:49.320\nSo being slow and methodical is a really\ncritical skill for incident handling.\n\n302\n00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.490\nSo, you can see here, things that we\nwanna be able to report on, right?\n\n303\n00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:54.530\nDate and time and\nlocation and the incident.\n\n304\n00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:56.130\nWell, that's obviously very important,\nright?\n\n305\n00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:58.930\nWhen did it happen, where,\nunder what circumstances?\n\n306\n00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:02.626\nWas there Colonel Mustard with\nthe candlestick in the kitchen at 2\n\n307\n00:14:02.626 --> 00:14:03.556\nin the morning?\n\n308\n00:14:03.556 --> 00:14:07.695\nOr was it somebody else on the staircase\nwhen you were trying to do something\n\n309\n00:14:07.695 --> 00:14:08.556\nelse, right?\n\n310\n00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:11.470\nWhatever it may be, so we need to know.\n\n311\n00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:12.780\nNobody got the Clue reference.\n\n312\n00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.970\nYou didn't even laugh at that one,\nI don't even know if you know with that.\n\n313\n00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:16.275\nYou ever play the game\nClue when you were a kid?\n\n314\n00:14:16.275 --> 00:14:17.870\n&gt;&gt; I do, yeah, my son loves it.\n\n315\n00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:19.941\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nthat was like a Clue reference, right?\n\n316\n00:14:19.941 --> 00:14:21.141\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That was Colonel Mustard.\n\n317\n00:14:21.141 --> 00:14:22.181\n&gt;&gt; I got it.\n&gt;&gt; Classic Clue character.\n\n318\n00:14:22.181 --> 00:14:24.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Mrs.\nPeacock in the kitchen with the knife.\n\n319\n00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:25.715\n&gt;&gt; You got it after the fact.\n\n320\n00:14:25.715 --> 00:14:27.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, exactly, right,\n\n321\n00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:28.300\nsomething like that.\n\n322\n00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.090\nSo we may have that stuff,\nwhat about contact information, right?\n\n323\n00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:34.409\nGotta get information for all the\nwitnesses, all the people that are gonna\n\n324\n00:14:34.409 --> 00:14:36.949\nbe there that we may have to\nfollow up with after the fact.\n\n325\n00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:39.587\nGotta have our own contact information\nas the incident responder and\n\n326\n00:14:39.587 --> 00:14:40.505\nthe incident handler.\n\n327\n00:14:40.505 --> 00:14:43.118\nSo that somebody who\ngets handed this later,\n\n328\n00:14:43.118 --> 00:14:45.260\nknows how to find us as well, right?\n\n329\n00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.000\nThis is all very important stuff.\n\n330\n00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.090\nCircumstances that revealed or led to our\nunderstanding that there was an incident.\n\n331\n00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:52.460\nHey, we got a phone call.\n\n332\n00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.110\nSomebody explained there seemed\nto be malware on the machine.\n\n333\n00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:58.573\nWe got a ticket that was opened up at\nthe service desk or the help desk,\n\n334\n00:14:58.573 --> 00:14:59.470\ngot an email.\n\n335\n00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:02.100\nThere's all these ways we may\nget notified there's an issue.\n\n336\n00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.830\nGotta think through that,\ngotta have a notation of that.\n\n337\n00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:06.939\nIf it was a phone call,\nmaybe there's a recording of that.\n\n338\n00:15:06.939 --> 00:15:09.830\nYou see that a lot on crime dramas,\nwith the 911 tape.\n\n339\n00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:12.040\nSo I may play them back after the fact.\n\n340\n00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.760\nYou're probably not recording all the\nphone calls that come into the help desk.\n\n341\n00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.720\nBut if somebody submitted an email or\n\n342\n00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.846\nopened up a ticket, there's gonna\nbe an actual record of that, right?\n\n343\n00:15:20.846 --> 00:15:25.120\nIn the help desk system or in the\nsoftware, you should be able to pull that\n\n344\n00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.570\nticket and reproduce that as\npart of the evidence file.\n\n345\n00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:30.800\nSo that's the kind of stuff we're\ntalking about, when we talk about this.\n\n346\n00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:35.308\nWe will often use, not often,\nwe do use forms for all this stuff.\n\n347\n00:15:35.308 --> 00:15:40.600\nWe have pre-made forms, templates that are\nset up so you can enter all this stuff.\n\n348\n00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.892\nA lot of it's done electronically today.\n\n349\n00:15:41.892 --> 00:15:45.120\nYears ago, you'd write all\nthis stuff out by hand, right?\n\n350\n00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.570\nThese days it's all done on computers.\n\n351\n00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:48.845\nSo you have just a template that comes up,\n\n352\n00:15:48.845 --> 00:15:51.777\nwe've shown you some\ndifferent forensic software.\n\n353\n00:15:51.777 --> 00:15:57.507\nI mentioned the Access FTK Imager, we took\na look at the Windows Forensic Toolchest.\n\n354\n00:15:57.507 --> 00:16:01.883\nIn there, we took a look at Helix in\nother episodes There's a place for\n\n355\n00:16:01.883 --> 00:16:05.962\ncase notes in most of those views\nin case you got a gold standard for\n\n356\n00:16:05.962 --> 00:16:10.090\nforensic software, and\nincident response software today.\n\n357\n00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:13.800\nWhen you use these kinds of packages,\nevery one of them has these templates,\n\n358\n00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:17.660\nhas these areas where you enter all\nthis stuff, the coroners toolkit.\n\n359\n00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:20.745\nThere's all of these different ones in\nLinux, and you're next whatever it may be,\n\n360\n00:16:20.745 --> 00:16:22.886\nyou just go through and\nenter on the appropriate screens.\n\n361\n00:16:22.886 --> 00:16:26.760\nYou sit there and just kinda type this\nstuff out, but it has to all be captured,\n\n362\n00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:30.600\nsaved off as what we call artifacts,\nand then becomes part of the file.\n\n363\n00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.010\nAnd then that file becomes transferable,\nyou can essentially give it to people and\n\n364\n00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:34.700\nlet them access it.\n\n365\n00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:38.950\nSo just make sure you're aware of that,\nsummary of hosts involved, what machine or\n\n366\n00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:40.450\nmachines were targeted.\n\n367\n00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:43.312\nSo host is just a fancy term we use for\nour individual endpoint,\n\n368\n00:16:43.312 --> 00:16:44.340\nthe machine, right?\n\n369\n00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:48.454\nIf it is a little bit unusual today\nbecause host can mean several things,\n\n370\n00:16:48.454 --> 00:16:52.028\nit always means the end point,\nbut remember a host can also mean\n\n371\n00:16:52.028 --> 00:16:55.640\na physical machine is being used for\nun virtual machines.\n\n372\n00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.750\nSo we may have different\nenvironments we respond to today.\n\n373\n00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:03.160\nSo the host is really just meant to say,\nwhatever the target of the incident was or\n\n374\n00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:06.350\ntargets, if it was more than one,\nthat's what we're gonna detail there.\n\n375\n00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:09.080\nWhat machine or machines and\nhow does that look?\n\n376\n00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:12.540\n&gt;&gt; So Adam, also, would this include other\ntypes of networking equipments such as,\n\n377\n00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:16.640\nswitches, or routers, or anything that's\nbuilding up a log that could just\n\n378\n00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.160\nadditionally support your argument or\nyour findings?\n\n379\n00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:24.133\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so if they are involved in\nsome way, so even if they're tangential or\n\n380\n00:17:24.133 --> 00:17:27.956\nif the attack transitive through that\nnetwork corridor to get to the end point.\n\n381\n00:17:27.956 --> 00:17:30.927\nSo if I wanna get to your machine,\nand I'm on my machine, and\n\n382\n00:17:30.927 --> 00:17:33.850\nI gotta go through our network\nto do that to your point.\n\n383\n00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:35.961\nThe hosts involved would\nbe the two machines and\n\n384\n00:17:35.961 --> 00:17:38.765\nwe could figure out which one\nwas used to start the attack.\n\n385\n00:17:38.765 --> 00:17:42.055\nBut certainly the endpoint, but then\nwe would look at things like firewalls,\n\n386\n00:17:42.055 --> 00:17:46.945\nrouters, IDS, intrusion detection,\nIPS, intrusion prevention.\n\n387\n00:17:46.945 --> 00:17:51.697\nThere may be proxies, there may be\na variety of logs from different areas,\n\n388\n00:17:51.697 --> 00:17:54.477\nwe may have a SEM,\nsolution of security information or\n\n389\n00:17:54.477 --> 00:17:57.087\nsecurity incident,\nevent management solution.\n\n390\n00:17:57.087 --> 00:18:00.627\nWe may have the old fashioned CIS log,\nthought process is kinda the same thing.\n\n391\n00:18:00.627 --> 00:18:03.693\nSo there may be lots of different\nsystems that may have touched or\n\n392\n00:18:03.693 --> 00:18:06.563\nin some way allowed this to occur.\n\n393\n00:18:06.563 --> 00:18:10.493\nThe challenge that we have with this,\nthat Cherokee is kind of pointing\n\n394\n00:18:10.493 --> 00:18:13.613\nout in the comment, is not so much,\nokay, do we know the endpoint?\n\n395\n00:18:13.613 --> 00:18:15.373\nWe know that, that's obvious, right, but\n\n396\n00:18:15.373 --> 00:18:18.816\nit's the broader, as you point out,\necosystem, right?\n\n397\n00:18:18.816 --> 00:18:22.356\nThe broader holistic vision of what\nthat network looks like, that may\n\n398\n00:18:22.356 --> 00:18:26.571\nnot always be clear to us initially and\nescape us as we start the investigation.\n\n399\n00:18:26.571 --> 00:18:29.388\nCuz I may not realize that the attack,\nhypothetically,\n\n400\n00:18:29.388 --> 00:18:32.688\nto place from left corner of the desk,\nI was able to get to you.\n\n401\n00:18:32.688 --> 00:18:35.418\nMaybe I'm in another studio, maybe I'm\nin another part of building, maybe I'm\n\n402\n00:18:35.418 --> 00:18:39.748\noutside, maybe I'm coming in remotely,\nand I have to cross through a gateway.\n\n403\n00:18:39.748 --> 00:18:45.308\nAnd that's kinda the snooping around and\nfiguring it out part, right?\n\n404\n00:18:45.308 --> 00:18:48.810\nBecause that's what we are doing, we're\ninvestigated trying to paint that picture.\n\n405\n00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:51.320\nAnd so ultimately that\ncircle does broaden, right?\n\n406\n00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.200\nIt definitely does get wider,\nbut usually in the beginning,\n\n407\n00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.860\nit's very narrowly defined\nbecause we may not realize all\n\n408\n00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:57.890\nthe things that were involved in that-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n409\n00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:00.240\n&gt;&gt; And so\nwe start to do that investigation.\n\n410\n00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.832\nSo it does definitely tend to get broader,\nright?\n\n411\n00:19:02.832 --> 00:19:04.990\nWe do tend to see more as we go,\nabsolutely.\n\n412\n00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:08.190\nSo we have summary of hosts involved,\ndescription of the activity,\n\n413\n00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:09.420\nwhat do we think happened?\n\n414\n00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:12.430\nTell the story, well,\nas far as we can tell,\n\n415\n00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:15.870\nthe user was working on the machine,\nopened up a web browser,\n\n416\n00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:21.780\nwent to what they thought was www.ITPro.tv\nand something happened, right?\n\n417\n00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:24.570\nWe kinda get that narrative from them so\nthat we can understand and\n\n418\n00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:26.900\ndescribe broadly what was going on.\n\n419\n00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:27.870\nWhat is the type of incident?\n\n420\n00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:31.680\nTypically there's classification and\ncategorization that takes place here.\n\n421\n00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:36.565\nDo we have an incident capability or\nincident categorization capability,\n\n422\n00:19:36.565 --> 00:19:38.486\nit says low, medium, high?\n\n423\n00:19:38.486 --> 00:19:42.000\nDo we say that it is on\na scale of one to five?\n\n424\n00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.040\nFive being the worst,\none being the lowest.\n\n425\n00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:48.263\nThere's different ways to classify but\nwhatever that internal categorization is\n\n426\n00:19:48.263 --> 00:19:52.739\nand classification scale is, that's what\nwe're using and referring to so sit tight.\n\n427\n00:19:52.739 --> 00:19:57.455\nSo we may just say computer hacking,\nwe may say physical access,\n\n428\n00:19:57.455 --> 00:19:59.380\ncontrol violation.\n\n429\n00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.680\nSomebody walked through a door and\npiggy backed so\n\n430\n00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.440\nthere were two people coming\nthrough on one card swipe.\n\n431\n00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.610\nThere's all these different things we\nmay say but we have to come up with what\n\n432\n00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:11.070\nthat internal thought process is,\nwhatever that categorization may be.\n\n433\n00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:15.021\nThat will be unique, by the way,\nto the organization, the enterprise and\n\n434\n00:20:15.021 --> 00:20:16.353\nthe incident response.\n\n435\n00:20:16.353 --> 00:20:21.339\nSo we as incident responders may have our\nown categorizations that we use if we\n\n436\n00:20:21.339 --> 00:20:26.170\nwork for a company, if we're internal\nas a Csert, we talk about different\n\n437\n00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:30.930\nCsert types, internal, external,\nadvisory, things like that.\n\n438\n00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:36.400\nIf we're internal, we follow the process\nprocedure policy of the organization,\n\n439\n00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.380\nor the entity, the enterprise.\n\n440\n00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:41.290\nAnd that's typically laid out as part of\nincident response to the management of it.\n\n441\n00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:45.480\nBut remember, we've spent a lot of time in\nprior episodes painting the picture of how\n\n442\n00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.500\nincident response becomes\npart of risk management, and\n\n443\n00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:50.390\nhow these two are paired together, right?\n\n444\n00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:55.020\nEssentially lock step together, and that\nthis is driven from the broader context\n\n445\n00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:58.500\nof enterprise security architecture,\nwe call the ESA in the business.\n\n446\n00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:02.770\nAnd that if we work internal at our\ndedicated as an embedded resources in\n\n447\n00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:06.410\nthe business with this security\nIT focus and function and\n\n448\n00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:10.870\ncapability, that we're being driven by\nthose internal policies and standards, and\n\n449\n00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:12.750\nso that's just something\nthat we have to think about.\n\n450\n00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:17.820\nBecause I've seen lots of different type\nof incident categorizations being used.\n\n451\n00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:19.580\nThere are industry standards, but\n\n452\n00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:23.350\nthere are also a variety\nof localized circumstantial\n\n453\n00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:25.910\nsolutions that are put in place,\ndepending on the nature of the incident.\n\n454\n00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:29.700\nSo don't be afraid to let your\ncreative flair show there, but\n\n455\n00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:33.110\njust understand that we may see variety,\nright?\n\n456\n00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:35.603\nThere's not necessarily just high,\nmedium, low, and that's all we ever see,\n\n457\n00:21:35.603 --> 00:21:37.243\nthere may be a lot of different\n[INAUDIBLE] processes-\n\n458\n00:21:37.243 --> 00:21:39.770\n&gt;&gt; Right, even just from me being more.\n\n459\n00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:41.630\nI'm not, obviously, a deep as you are,\n\n460\n00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:43.172\nbut just from the different vendor-\n&gt;&gt; You're very deep.\n\n461\n00:21:43.172 --> 00:21:47.992\n&gt;&gt; Certification vendors,\nwe've got internal, external, man-made,\n\n462\n00:21:47.992 --> 00:21:51.120\nall sorts of categorizations there.\n\n463\n00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.880\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n464\n00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.060\nWhat were we saying?\n\n465\n00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:54.957\nI'm kidding.\n&gt;&gt; Nature of the data involved-\n\n466\n00:21:54.957 --> 00:21:56.406\n&gt;&gt; I'm only kidding, I'm only kidding.\n\n467\n00:21:56.406 --> 00:21:57.888\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right so, type of incident,\n\n468\n00:21:57.888 --> 00:21:58.390\nwe talked about that.\n\n469\n00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:01.320\nNature of the data involved, you can see\nI put it in parentheses there private,\n\n470\n00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.210\npublic, corporate.\n\n471\n00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:04.150\nRemember, we have different types of data,\nright?\n\n472\n00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:07.650\nWhen we have private data, PI, personally\nidentifiable information, may have\n\n473\n00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:12.420\npublicly available data, somebody's\nFacebook page, or whatever it may be.\n\n474\n00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:16.760\nCorporate data, intellectual properties,\ncorporate IP falls into this,\n\n475\n00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:20.040\nthere's lots of different stuff\nthat spans the gamut here, right?\n\n476\n00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:23.620\nAnd so we have to understand\nthat an attack on a machine,\n\n477\n00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:27.000\nmy machine, this machine,\nCherokee's machine.\n\n478\n00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.450\nI'm sure she's got personally\nidentifiable information on her laptop,\n\n479\n00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:32.930\nshe's probably also got\ncorporate data on her laptop,\n\n480\n00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:36.560\nstuff for ITPRO.TV, show notes,\nall sorts of stuff, right?\n\n481\n00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:40.000\nSo there's a mixture of stuff\ntypically on most people's computers,\n\n482\n00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:40.880\nwe gotta understand that.\n\n483\n00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:45.114\nAnd we have to be aware of that, because\nwe have to categorize, and capture, and\n\n484\n00:22:45.114 --> 00:22:49.228\nunderstand the impact of all the different\ntypes of data that may be exposed and\n\n485\n00:22:49.228 --> 00:22:49.876\nbreached.\n\n486\n00:22:49.876 --> 00:22:54.414\nAnd made available, through a lack of\nconfidentiality protections being applied\n\n487\n00:22:54.414 --> 00:22:58.110\nbecause of the breach, so\nwe wanna be thinking about that.\n\n488\n00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:01.499\nOther individuals that are involved,\ndoes that circle broaden wide, and\n\n489\n00:23:01.499 --> 00:23:03.538\ndo we have other actors, good, or, bad, or\n\n490\n00:23:03.538 --> 00:23:07.395\nneutral that have become part of the story\nand part of the tapestry of this incident.\n\n491\n00:23:07.395 --> 00:23:10.701\nAnd we have to identify them, we have\nto make sure we know how to reach them,\n\n492\n00:23:10.701 --> 00:23:12.906\nwe have to have follow up information for\nthem, so\n\n493\n00:23:12.906 --> 00:23:15.430\nthere's a lot of stuff that has to happen.\n\n494\n00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:17.570\nImpact or\nimpacts identified after the incident,\n\n495\n00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:20.540\nif any,\ndid somebody get our account information,\n\n496\n00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:23.570\nif they did, what was the impact of that,\nright, those kind of things.\n\n497\n00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:25.321\n&gt;&gt; Adam I have a question\nabout the individuals.\n\n498\n00:23:25.321 --> 00:23:30.456\nSo I've always kinda wondered this,\nlooking at selecting your witnesses,\n\n499\n00:23:30.456 --> 00:23:34.959\nif you decided to use any,\nwe also wanna keep in mind maybe selecting\n\n500\n00:23:34.959 --> 00:23:39.541\nthe right kind of witnesses too\nbecause like we spoke about earlier,\n\n501\n00:23:39.541 --> 00:23:45.174\nwe don't want to open a vulnerability for\nour defense at all in that manner, right?\n\n502\n00:23:45.174 --> 00:23:48.915\n&gt;&gt; So yeah,\nit's a very good point to make.\n\n503\n00:23:48.915 --> 00:23:51.850\nWe don't really select\nwitnesses per se at this point.\n\n504\n00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:53.701\n&gt;&gt; That'd be more of the legal counsel-\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n505\n00:23:53.701 --> 00:23:55.237\nlet's kind of break it into two parts.\n\n506\n00:23:55.237 --> 00:23:57.777\nI understand what you're asking,\nit's a very good point of clarification.\n\n507\n00:23:57.777 --> 00:23:59.607\nBut let's tell two stories around this.\n\n508\n00:23:59.607 --> 00:24:00.743\nSo can we put the list back up,\n\n509\n00:24:00.743 --> 00:24:02.930\nbecause I want to refer to it\nas part of what the answer is.\n\n510\n00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:06.600\nSo what's happening here is we're going\nthrough initial incident response, right?\n\n511\n00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:10.760\nWe're showing up, something bad's\nhappened, they call in the incident\n\n512\n00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:14.020\nresponse team and\nwe're figuring out what's going to happen.\n\n513\n00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.620\nWe're the people to put the little\nyellow cones down with the numbers and\n\n514\n00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:17.910\nput the caution tape around and\n\n515\n00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:19.280\ntake the pictures and-\n&gt;&gt; We're not there yet.\n\n516\n00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:21.380\n&gt;&gt; Right, we're that,\nthat's what we're doing.\n\n517\n00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:23.550\nSo what I'm saying is [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; We're not there for the selection part.\n\n518\n00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:27.580\n&gt;&gt; Well so what we're doing now is\nwe're identifying all the things and\n\n519\n00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:28.150\nthe key players.\n\n520\n00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:32.380\nWe are identifying individuals that may\nbe of interest as the term we would use.\n\n521\n00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:34.500\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n&gt;&gt; They're not witnesses at this point.\n\n522\n00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:35.530\nIn the traditional sense, yes,\n\n523\n00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:37.320\nthey may have witnessed\nsomething that happened there.\n\n524\n00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:41.060\nGenerically called witnesses, but they're\npeople of interest, meaning people that\n\n525\n00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:44.470\nhave information that we want to\nbe able to most likely hear from.\n\n526\n00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:47.420\nWant to have them tell us their story,\nwant to capture that.\n\n527\n00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:51.980\nBut as an incident responder, we are not\nthe person who makes the determination\n\n528\n00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:54.370\nas to who will be a witness\nif we go to trial.\n\n529\n00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:56.430\n&gt;&gt; I see.\n&gt;&gt; So ultimately, we tell that story,\n\n530\n00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:59.500\nwe document it,\nwe may be an expert witness ourselves.\n\n531\n00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.360\nWe often are called to testify and\n\n532\n00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:04.700\noften are called to tell\nthe story about what we found.\n\n533\n00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:07.820\nBut, the prosecution or the defense,\n\n534\n00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:11.000\nwhoever the lawyers are that\nare gonna be involved in one or\n\n535\n00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.900\nboth sides of that case, they are gonna\nbe, through a process known as discovery,\n\n536\n00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:19.030\nthey are going to be given all\nthe information that the other side has,\n\n537\n00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:22.210\nhas access to and essentially has\nbuilt up as part of their case.\n\n538\n00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:24.430\nThat includes things like a witness list,\nso you know,\n\n539\n00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:26.980\nwho are the potential people\nthat the defense wants to call.\n\n540\n00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:30.680\nThe prosecution has the right to see that\nlist and be able to interview them ahead\n\n541\n00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:34.890\nof time and understand who they are and\nyou get their side of the story,\n\n542\n00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:37.990\njust like the defense has rights to do so\nto the prosecution.\n\n543\n00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:39.920\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Very equal in that respect, right.\n\n544\n00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:44.970\nSo those witnesses, people that are going\nto have something valuable to offer to\n\n545\n00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:48.540\ncreate in the minds of the people that\nare gonna hear this case of the judge,\n\n546\n00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:51.880\nthe compelling story that will\nhopefully prove their point and\n\n547\n00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.070\nessentially discredit the other side.\n\n548\n00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:58.110\nThose are decisions made by the opposing\ncouncils, so not made by us.\n\n549\n00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:00.720\nSo, we are in charge of\ngiving them as complete and\n\n550\n00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.960\naccurate a picture, and\noptions of what has happened.\n\n551\n00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.130\nBut then, in terms of defining that,\n\n552\n00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:07.960\nthat's something that typically\nwe don't play a part in.\n\n553\n00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.730\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n&gt;&gt; More often than not.\n\n554\n00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:11.900\nAll right, so responses if any,\nwhat did we do?\n\n555\n00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:14.910\nDid we put anti-malware on the system?\n\n556\n00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:15.940\nDo we disinfect it?\n\n557\n00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:19.300\nDo we decide we're gonna shut it down,\ntake it,\n\n558\n00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:21.300\nreplace the hard drive that went bad?\n\n559\n00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:23.490\nJust tell the story of what happened,\nwhat did we do?\n\n560\n00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:25.850\nThat's really what response is all about,\nright?\n\n561\n00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:27.640\nSo when we're thinking\nabout the details for\n\n562\n00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:30.540\nthe reported time of\nthe breach this is that list.\n\n563\n00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:33.830\nSomebody said to you hey, what are the ten\nthings you gotta do and you had\n\n564\n00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:37.570\nto answer a question about it, this is the\nstuff you wanna know right here, right?\n\n565\n00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:39.790\nSo make sure you're familiar with this.\n\n566\n00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:42.670\nI put a note there just since we're here,\nwe'll just quickly go down the list cuz I\n\n567\n00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:45.340\nwanna talk about the US\ncert categories as well.\n\n568\n00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:47.120\nI put a note there,\nremember the importance of time,\n\n569\n00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:49.310\nNTP, network time protocol, right?\n\n570\n00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:51.040\nWe've talked in other episodes and\n\n571\n00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:55.880\nother shows about the fact that NTP\ntime specification, in terms of knowing\n\n572\n00:26:55.880 --> 00:27:00.670\nthat every machine in an organization is\nsynced and is running at the same time.\n\n573\n00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:05.020\nSo that logs are time stamped accurately,\naccess control is accurate,\n\n574\n00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.240\nthings of that nature.\n\n575\n00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:10.460\nYou can't under estimate and\nover estimate the importance of this.\n\n576\n00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:13.500\nIf you don't have good NTP, good time and\n\n577\n00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:18.400\ngood control of time, you have no basis\nto build any kind of incident chain and\n\n578\n00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:22.310\nany kind of forensic information\nthat can be seen as being valuable.\n\n579\n00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:25.630\nBecause if we can't validate\nthat 5:00 AM on this machine,\n\n580\n00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:29.640\nit's the same as 5:00 AM on every\nother machine in this organization,\n\n581\n00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.540\nthen time stamps are not accurate.\n\n582\n00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:35.020\nAnd whatever happened at 5:00 AM may\nactually have happened in a different time\n\n583\n00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:36.720\nbecause we have no way of knowing for\nsure.\n\n584\n00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:40.560\nWe call this time drift,\nwhere the systems are not synchronized.\n\n585\n00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:44.650\nAnd if we have time drift, we have\na fundamental issue with regards to\n\n586\n00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:48.350\nforensic examination and incident response\ncuz we can't authoritatively establish\n\n587\n00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:50.070\nwhen something accurately took place.\n\n588\n00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:52.660\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, if you even think\nabout the security cameras,\n\n589\n00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:55.870\nthe systems running those machines,\nthe security cameras.\n\n590\n00:27:55.870 --> 00:28:00.220\nAnd if you look at that timeline and\ntrying to find a good alibi and\n\n591\n00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:03.740\nthings like that that's gonna\npunch holes in your defense there.\n\n592\n00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:08.200\n&gt;&gt; It is, and one of the tell tale signs\nor warning signs of hacking that may have\n\n593\n00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:11.530\ntaken place, it's an incident responder\nthat we look for, is if we know for\n\n594\n00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:14.780\na fact we have NTP running and\nwe find machines that are decoupled,\n\n595\n00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:18.570\nessentially desynchronized, they're not\nrunning and are not time synced and\n\n596\n00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:21.485\nthere is time drift but\nonly on certain machines.\n\n597\n00:28:21.485 --> 00:28:24.395\nThat's usually an indicator that\nthose machines have been the target\n\n598\n00:28:24.395 --> 00:28:25.155\nof an attack.\n\n599\n00:28:25.155 --> 00:28:29.145\nThey've been desynchronized specifically\nto throw off the logging and\n\n600\n00:28:29.145 --> 00:28:30.985\nthe time stamps on the machines, so\n\n601\n00:28:30.985 --> 00:28:34.245\nwe don't have an accurate representation\nof when the attack took place.\n\n602\n00:28:34.245 --> 00:28:36.900\nSo this would, in and\nof itself, be a warning sign.\n\n603\n00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:39.840\nWhen we see, it's not always because\nthere are legitimate reasons why\n\n604\n00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:43.050\ncertain machines may become unsynchronized\njust through the normal course of\n\n605\n00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:44.080\noperations, right.\n\n606\n00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.730\nThings can happen in other words.\n\n607\n00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:50.790\nWe never wanna assume but we do wanna take\nnote of and verify interesting facts.\n\n608\n00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:54.350\nAnd we would very easily be able to\ntell if that decoupling had happened as\n\n609\n00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:59.190\na result of just some normal operational\nissue, the NTP server stopped working,\n\n610\n00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:00.410\nwe stopped synchronizing.\n\n611\n00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:03.220\nAnd we just happen to be at\nthe beginning of that episode,\n\n612\n00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.410\nunrelated to the incident or\nyeah, somebody hacked in and\n\n613\n00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:09.040\ndecoupled those five machines but\neverything else was left alone.\n\n614\n00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:10.520\nSo we have to understand that.\n\n615\n00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.480\nOne other thing just to talk about\nto round us out here, the US CERT.\n\n616\n00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:16.270\nWe've talked about US CERT before,\ntaking you out to the website,\n\n617\n00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:19.840\nremember, under Department of\nHomeland Security in the United States,\n\n618\n00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.990\nwe see a lot of these responder agencies.\n\n619\n00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:28.080\nSo the US CERT is the US federal\ngovernment's information or\n\n620\n00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.420\ncomputer emergency response team.\n\n621\n00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:33.680\nAnd so this is the team that gets\nthe phone call when there's a problem from\n\n622\n00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:34.960\na federal agency.\n\n623\n00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.730\nThis is the group that\nputs out advisory and\n\n624\n00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:39.980\nupdate information for\nany entity that wants to consume that.\n\n625\n00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:42.820\nWe've been through that and\nshown that to you in other episodes.\n\n626\n00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:47.210\nBut they use a categorization ranking,\nand you can see CAT 0 through CAT\n\n627\n00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:50.610\n6 displayed here for\nyou as to basically what an incident is.\n\n628\n00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:53.630\nWhen we talk about categorizing incidents\nas one of the things we wanna do and\n\n629\n00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:57.260\ncapture in our reporting, there may\nbe a standardized methodology and\n\n630\n00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:58.690\nthis is an example of one.\n\n631\n00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:02.270\nYou could see CAT 0, Exercise or\nNetwork Defense Testing.\n\n632\n00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:06.500\nYou'll CAT 3 Malicious Code CAT 6\nInvestigation, they've laid out\n\n633\n00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:11.430\na standardized categorization so that they\ncan easily attach incidents that occur and\n\n634\n00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:15.740\nin their reporting here this is a CAT 2\nthis is a DoS or denial of service attack.\n\n635\n00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:19.120\nAnd then they can update and report,\nbased on that categorization.\n\n636\n00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:22.410\nSo, you wanna have some sort\nof categorization built out,\n\n637\n00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:24.540\nthis is a great example of\none that exists out there.\n\n638\n00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:28.230\nIt would be good for you to know this, if\nyou're planning on taking the ECIH exam.\n\n639\n00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:31.060\nYou may get asked about it\nin the relation to US-CERT.\n\n640\n00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:34.980\nDo other countries have their own version\nof this with their own cert teams?\n\n641\n00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:38.710\nAbsolutely, may look identical or\nsimilar to this?\n\n642\n00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:42.230\nIt may, may look slightly different,\nit may, hard to say, right?\n\n643\n00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:45.810\nWe didn't put up the 200 that exists\nfrom a survey country in the world,\n\n644\n00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:47.650\nwe just used the random sampling of 1.\n\n645\n00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:50.890\nBut a lot of the standardization\nthat we see in this industry\n\n646\n00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:53.028\nwill look very similar to this just so\nyou understand, okay?\n\n647\n00:30:53.028 --> 00:30:53.641\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n648\n00:30:53.641 --> 00:30:54.254\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n649\n00:30:54.254 --> 00:30:56.010\n&gt;&gt; Well, thanks you Adam so much for\n\n650\n00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:59.220\ntaking the time to explain those ten\nareas of interest in addition to\n\n651\n00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:03.540\nthose US CERT categorizations but that\nabout does it for this particular show.\n\n652\n00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:05.710\nWe're out of time so\nI'm gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n653\n00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:08.020\nAs your show host I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n654\n00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:08.930\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:08.330\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.945\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:16.834\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your ECIH series,\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.834 --> 00:00:20.070\nAnd this episode will be\nlooking at incident recovery.\n\n7\n00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.276\nAnd with us today we have Mr. Adam Gordon\nin studio to help us cover this topic.\n\n8\n00:00:23.276 --> 00:00:25.440\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n9\n00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.799\n&gt;&gt; Hello everybody, so\nhopefully everybody's doing well.\n\n10\n00:00:27.799 --> 00:00:31.318\nWe're gonna talk a bit more or\ncontinue talking I should say,\n\n11\n00:00:31.318 --> 00:00:34.095\nabout incident handling,\nincident response,\n\n12\n00:00:34.095 --> 00:00:37.363\nwhat it means to be a incident\npractitioner of some kind.\n\n13\n00:00:37.363 --> 00:00:40.739\nWhen we think about being incident\nresponder we think about incident\n\n14\n00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.960\nrecovery, the idea is that we're\ngonna show up on site, right?\n\n15\n00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.152\nWe're gonna have some sort of\nconcern we're gomma address, or\n\n16\n00:00:47.152 --> 00:00:49.232\nhave been asked to come in and to address.\n\n17\n00:00:49.232 --> 00:00:52.012\nAnd people look to us to\nbe that voice of reason,\n\n18\n00:00:52.012 --> 00:00:56.532\nthat stability that they need to have\nbrought back through a sense of normalcy\n\n19\n00:00:56.532 --> 00:01:00.442\nreturning to what's a probably\nvery chaotic, very disruptive.\n\n20\n00:01:00.442 --> 00:01:01.443\nAnd most likely,\n\n21\n00:01:01.443 --> 00:01:05.970\nvery unusual set of circumstances in\noperational environment for them.\n\n22\n00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.910\nAnd it's important for\nus as we start this conversation,\n\n23\n00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.040\nreally think about the fact\nthat if we overreact,\n\n24\n00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.890\nif we get all kinda flustered and crazy,\nand we go to pieces so to speak ourselves.\n\n25\n00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.115\nIt's gonna be very hard for us not only do\nour job, but for us to assure the person\n\n26\n00:01:21.115 --> 00:01:25.108\nor whoever the entity is that we're\ndealing with things are gonna be okay.\n\n27\n00:01:25.108 --> 00:01:28.932\nA lot of times the most important thing\nyou need to do with regards to dealing\n\n28\n00:01:28.932 --> 00:01:32.452\nwith an incident is just to assure\nthe people that are involved that,\n\n29\n00:01:32.452 --> 00:01:34.595\nwhatever's happened, it'll be okay.\n\n30\n00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:38.545\nYou'll figure it out, and that if they\ncould just relax and help you by not\n\n31\n00:01:38.545 --> 00:01:42.384\ngetting in the way, but simply being\navailable if you need something.\n\n32\n00:01:42.384 --> 00:01:46.335\nAnd in the meantime,\njust kinda take a deep breath and relax.\n\n33\n00:01:46.335 --> 00:01:49.625\nIt's gonna make things so much easier for\neverybody, for you as the first or\n\n34\n00:01:49.625 --> 00:01:52.135\nincident responder if you're\nthere on scene first or\n\n35\n00:01:52.135 --> 00:01:53.790\nhave been called in after the fact.\n\n36\n00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.220\nFor the victim or victims,\nwhoever they may be.\n\n37\n00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.410\nAnd of course, broadly for the team\nat large because more often than not,\n\n38\n00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.960\nyou're not the only person responding.\n\n39\n00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.749\nYou may be part of a team,\nwe talked a lot about this methodology,\n\n40\n00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:06.779\nthis thought process.\n\n41\n00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:11.429\nThis mentality of being a member of a cert\nor a C-cert and the fact that you may\n\n42\n00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:15.700\nbring to the table one or\nmore specialties or areas of knowledge.\n\n43\n00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.620\nAnd that may be what we call on you for,\nand so you may be the database person,\n\n44\n00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.240\nyou may be the firewall person.\n\n45\n00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.430\nYou may be the person who\nunderstands how to do memory dumps\n\n46\n00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.590\nbetter than anybody else.\n\n47\n00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.020\nThat's your thing, that's your specialty,\nthat's your superpower, as we say, right?\n\n48\n00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.789\nBut whatever that may be,tThat's only one\npiece of a broader puzzle with regards to\n\n49\n00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:34.328\nresponse.\n\n50\n00:02:34.328 --> 00:02:39.130\nIt's very rare in other words,\nthat incident response is an army of one.\n\n51\n00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.120\nIt's almost without exception gonna be\na group of very talented, dedicated and\n\n52\n00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.080\nvery specialized and specially trained\n\n53\n00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.300\nindividuals that form a team that may\nnot always respond to every incident.\n\n54\n00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.627\nIf we don't have a database,\n\n55\n00:02:53.627 --> 00:02:56.607\nin theory if we know ahead of time\nthere's no databases involved.\n\n56\n00:02:56.607 --> 00:03:00.243\nWe may not need the person that does\ndatabases traditionally as part of that\n\n57\n00:03:00.243 --> 00:03:01.290\nincident response.\n\n58\n00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.994\nBut if they happen to also understand how\nto do other things that may be pertinent\n\n59\n00:03:04.994 --> 00:03:07.167\nto response, maybe they come along, right?\n\n60\n00:03:07.167 --> 00:03:08.119\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; So Adam-\n\n61\n00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.640\n&gt;&gt; Just keep that in mind.\n\n62\n00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.460\n&gt;&gt; In the previous episode,\nwe are talking about incident reporting.\n\n63\n00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.980\nAnd although you were just mentioning not\neveryone may have to wear numerous hats,\n\n64\n00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.730\nhow does that relate\ninto incident recovery?\n\n65\n00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:20.597\nIs it happening in tandem?\n\n66\n00:03:20.597 --> 00:03:22.170\nAre we delegating?\n\n67\n00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.490\nWhat's going on?\n\n68\n00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.791\n&gt;&gt; Well so it would depend, right?\n\n69\n00:03:25.791 --> 00:03:30.050\nA lot of times, while people\nmay have a primary hat, right?\n\n70\n00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.050\nTo use the analogy and\nthat's what they may go with.\n\n71\n00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.012\nYou may be the first responder on site\nwhich means, you may be literally an army\n\n72\n00:03:37.012 --> 00:03:40.504\nof one, you may by yourself,\nnobody else may be with you initially.\n\n73\n00:03:40.504 --> 00:03:43.070\nYou may have to do a variety of things.\n\n74\n00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.270\nYou may be called out as\npart of the second or\n\n75\n00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.860\nthird wave to deal with the examination\nof an established scene.\n\n76\n00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.882\nOnce the first responders have\nyou initially taken care of,\n\n77\n00:03:52.882 --> 00:03:54.373\nwhatever may have occurred.\n\n78\n00:03:54.373 --> 00:03:59.065\nWe use this language, and people\nare referred to as first responders really\n\n79\n00:03:59.065 --> 00:04:03.770\nbecause we think of more life safety\nrelated, life impact related issues.\n\n80\n00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.010\nThere's a car accident, there's a fire.\n\n81\n00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.625\nThere's some sort of event where you\ndo have fire and police personnel.\n\n82\n00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:14.166\nTrue first responders showing up and\ndealing with life safety issues and\n\n83\n00:04:14.166 --> 00:04:15.627\nhaving to stabilize people.\n\n84\n00:04:15.627 --> 00:04:20.095\nAnd maybe get them to a hospital and\nmake sure they're gonna be okay.\n\n85\n00:04:20.095 --> 00:04:24.634\nAnd then other people may come along, and\ndeal with other officers, other firemen,\n\n86\n00:04:24.634 --> 00:04:27.108\nother paramedics,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n87\n00:04:27.108 --> 00:04:30.888\nMay deal with the car wreck and\nget the things off to the side, and\n\n88\n00:04:30.888 --> 00:04:33.330\nwhatever the case may be with that.\n\n89\n00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.441\nWe're not typically dealing with those\nkinds of issues, thankfully, right?\n\n90\n00:04:36.441 --> 00:04:41.310\nAs computer Incident responders, we're not\nnormally dealing with life and death and\n\n91\n00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.900\nlife safety related issues,\nalmost without exception.\n\n92\n00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.331\nAnd as a result,\nwe use the term first responder, but\n\n93\n00:04:47.331 --> 00:04:49.501\nit's not really the traditional use,\nright?\n\n94\n00:04:49.501 --> 00:04:51.549\nIt's just a person that, in theory,\n\n95\n00:04:51.549 --> 00:04:55.392\njust simply the first security\nprofessional that happens to show up and\n\n96\n00:04:55.392 --> 00:04:59.700\ndeal with that incident, is just as a\ngeneric label we call it first responder.\n\n97\n00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.407\nBut we're not the same people that\nmay go into harm's way, right?\n\n98\n00:05:03.407 --> 00:05:07.926\nIn a real world scenario to deal with\nthose incredibly difficult situations\n\n99\n00:05:07.926 --> 00:05:09.900\nto safeguard life, right?\n\n100\n00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.060\nBut having said that,\nwe may do a variety of things.\n\n101\n00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.180\nWhen it comes to incident recovery,\nwe may have to show up and\n\n102\n00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.120\nmay have to stabilize a machine.\n\n103\n00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.323\nMeaning maybe there's malware or root kit,\nsomething like that on the machine that's\n\n104\n00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:25.724\nbeing used to control and\nattack other machines.\n\n105\n00:05:25.724 --> 00:05:28.390\nAnd maybe we have to very\nquickly figure that out and\n\n106\n00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.970\nisolate that machine by cutting off its\nnetwork access hypothetically, right?\n\n107\n00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.111\nMaybe this machine, whatever the machine\nis that we're talking about,\n\n108\n00:05:37.111 --> 00:05:39.793\nmaybe this machine has\nalready been attacked.\n\n109\n00:05:39.793 --> 00:05:42.014\nAnd now it's a question of\njust understanding it and\n\n110\n00:05:42.014 --> 00:05:43.184\nthen recovering, right?\n\n111\n00:05:43.184 --> 00:05:47.557\nA sense we just isolating the machine\ntaking essentially all the valuable\n\n112\n00:05:47.557 --> 00:05:50.108\nforensic information that we can gather.\n\n113\n00:05:50.108 --> 00:05:54.530\nAnd then trying to put the pieces back\ntogether, and we may reimage the machine.\n\n114\n00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:59.461\nWe may restore the operational environment\nof the machine by removing malware and\n\n115\n00:05:59.461 --> 00:06:03.404\ncertifying the machine is clean\nat least the best of our ability.\n\n116\n00:06:03.404 --> 00:06:05.200\nThere's a lot of different\nthings we may do.\n\n117\n00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.463\nSo we may wear multiple hats,\nwe may do multiple things.\n\n118\n00:06:07.463 --> 00:06:12.180\nWe may report on multiple things, and\na lot of times if it's something simple.\n\n119\n00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.670\nHey, I think I have malware and\nmaybe it's just one person that responds.\n\n120\n00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.441\nMaybe you don't need\na whole army of people, but\n\n121\n00:06:18.441 --> 00:06:23.376\nwhen this is a large scale breach, a huge\nincident, an attack against infrastructure\n\n122\n00:06:23.376 --> 00:06:27.250\nthat is from the outside that is\nperpetrated by one or more hackers.\n\n123\n00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.434\nYou're probably gonna need a larger number\nof people, however many there may be,\n\n124\n00:06:31.434 --> 00:06:33.350\nwhatever that may look like.\n\n125\n00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.583\nSo when we think about incident\nrecovery and incident response,\n\n126\n00:06:35.583 --> 00:06:37.298\nit's really about restoring normalcy,\nright?\n\n127\n00:06:37.298 --> 00:06:39.240\nWe were chatting a little bit you and\nI, right?\n\n128\n00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.774\nBefore the show and you asked about and\nkinda made the connection,\n\n129\n00:06:42.774 --> 00:06:44.173\nI think it's a great one.\n\n130\n00:06:44.173 --> 00:06:48.670\nAbout the fact that incident recover\nreally becomes part of the concept of\n\n131\n00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:49.621\nBCDR, right?\n\n132\n00:06:49.621 --> 00:06:51.988\nWe're talking about business continuity,\ndisaster recovery.\n\n133\n00:06:51.988 --> 00:06:54.491\nAnd you brought out the fact that\nthis is essentially part of that.\n\n134\n00:06:54.491 --> 00:06:57.550\nIt's almost like an extension\nof what we would do.\n\n135\n00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.585\nAnd it is, the incident response plan and\n\n136\n00:06:59.585 --> 00:07:02.331\nthe incident recovery\ncapabilities that we engage in.\n\n137\n00:07:02.331 --> 00:07:05.600\nAnd the steps we go through\nmethodically to do so.\n\n138\n00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.490\nContextual though they may be, and\nobviously situationally unique and\n\n139\n00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.270\ntailored to that particular circumstance.\n\n140\n00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:16.570\nBut we come off that general\nplaybook of the BCDR plans,\n\n141\n00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.730\nbis continuity disaster recovery plans.\n\n142\n00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:22.020\nAnd incidence response is a subset\nof that traditionally and\n\n143\n00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.600\nwe want to view it that way and really\nunderstand it from that perspective.\n\n144\n00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.132\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n145\n00:07:27.132 --> 00:07:27.933\n&gt;&gt; What?\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n146\n00:07:27.933 --> 00:07:28.841\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, thank you.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Good job, Adam.\n\n147\n00:07:28.841 --> 00:07:30.898\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Wait, are we on the screen?\n\n148\n00:07:30.898 --> 00:07:31.972\nThere we go.\n\n149\n00:07:31.972 --> 00:07:34.186\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There we go, outstanding.\n\n150\n00:07:34.186 --> 00:07:37.020\nAll right, so\nI'm glad Cherokee thinks it was perfect.\n\n151\n00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.978\nThat really does warm my heart.\n\n152\n00:07:37.978 --> 00:07:38.844\n&gt;&gt; Just for clarifying for me, yeah.\n\n153\n00:07:38.844 --> 00:07:40.092\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Makes me feel so special.\n\n154\n00:07:40.092 --> 00:07:41.938\nAll right, so what does it involve?\n\n155\n00:07:41.938 --> 00:07:44.239\nWhen Cherokee and\nI were talking about this,\n\n156\n00:07:44.239 --> 00:07:48.540\nshe actually asked me about this, said\nthis is essentially what it is, right?\n\n157\n00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.127\nShe specifically said, hey,\nbased on how you describe it and\n\n158\n00:07:51.127 --> 00:07:54.432\nbased on what you say it is, that's what\nmakes me think of it this way, right?\n\n159\n00:07:54.432 --> 00:07:58.360\nYou said involves designing,\ndocumenting, implementing, testing and\n\n160\n00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.225\nmaintaining of the procedures\nto help us to mitigate,\n\n161\n00:08:01.225 --> 00:08:03.800\nminimize from our\nmitigation to minimization.\n\n162\n00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.793\nMItigating the risks associated with\nthe incident negative impacts and\n\n163\n00:08:07.793 --> 00:08:10.488\nconsequence and\nreturn to normal stream right.\n\n164\n00:08:10.488 --> 00:08:13.974\nSo we wanna get back to normal\nafter the incidents and do so\n\n165\n00:08:13.974 --> 00:08:19.220\non a thoughtful formalize structured and\nlegitimate auditable and verifiable way.\n\n166\n00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.820\nA little bit war.\n\n167\n00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:24.210\nSo I wanna make sure till recovery\nultimate helps us to minimize\n\n168\n00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:28.490\nthe negative impact, make the bad things\ngo away make our ability to be able to do\n\n169\n00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:32.320\nwhat we normally do as part of our\naverage, every day use come back, right?\n\n170\n00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.260\nI just wanna make the pain go away and\nget back to normal.\n\n171\n00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.510\nIt's really what incident response\nis all about at the end of the day.\n\n172\n00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:40.400\nIncidence response, incidence recovery\nis really about making sure that\n\n173\n00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.820\nafter something bad has happened,\nthat we have mechanisms, tools,\n\n174\n00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.340\nprocedures, knowledge, and capability.\n\n175\n00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:50.820\nBrought to bear, to get back to normal\nas soon as possible, and verify and\n\n176\n00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:55.550\nvalidate that the bad thing that happened,\nnumber one, is not gonna to happen again.\n\n177\n00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:57.260\nCuz we do root cause analysis.\n\n178\n00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:02.228\nWe understand, hopefully,\nif we're successful, what the problem was,\n\n179\n00:09:02.228 --> 00:09:04.176\nor problems, more than one.\n\n180\n00:09:04.176 --> 00:09:08.342\nAnd as a result of that, we can document\nand figure out how to modify and\n\n181\n00:09:08.342 --> 00:09:13.440\nchange behavior, so as a result, we can\nhopefully prevent it from happening again.\n\n182\n00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.078\nThis is gonna also be a very\nimportant thought process.\n\n183\n00:09:16.078 --> 00:09:20.020\n&gt;&gt; Now, Adam, you've given us some great\nsolutions and perfect guidelines so far.\n\n184\n00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:23.123\nAre there any steps or\nany kind of tips you could you give us\n\n185\n00:09:23.123 --> 00:09:26.175\nhere as to how to go ahead and\nperform into the recovery?\n\n186\n00:09:26.175 --> 00:09:27.577\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely not,\nI have no idea what you're talking about.\n\n187\n00:09:27.577 --> 00:09:29.547\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What are we here to speak about?\n\n188\n00:09:29.547 --> 00:09:31.320\nIsn't this something other than-\n&gt;&gt; Wait, what?\n\n189\n00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:31.896\nWrong show.\n\n190\n00:09:31.896 --> 00:09:34.050\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, let's start over again.\n\n191\n00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:35.280\nNo, absolutely, let's talk about it.\n\n192\n00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:40.530\nIt's actually a great thought process, and\na great segue, into the exact methodology\n\n193\n00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:44.580\nor thought process we would engage in\nthat we need that to think about, right?\n\n194\n00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.520\nSo what are the steps?\n\n195\n00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.220\nThat was just me hitting\nmy toe against the podium.\n\n196\n00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.130\nI wasn't paying attention.\n\n197\n00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:50.520\nSo incident recovery steps.\n\n198\n00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.340\nRight?\nWhat are they?\n\n199\n00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.800\nUsually we can identify\nfour recovery steps.\n\n200\n00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:59.170\nWe have restoration, validation,\noperations, and monitoring.\n\n201\n00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:00.410\nAnd so when we think about it,\n\n202\n00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:02.440\nthe word system would be in front\nof everyone of those, right?\n\n203\n00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.700\nSystem operations, systems validation\nright cuz we're talking about one or\n\n204\n00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:06.260\nmore systems.\n\n205\n00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.740\nSo when we think about restoration\nwe're thinking about being able to,\n\n206\n00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:13.690\nif at all possible get that\nsystem back into it's prior\n\n207\n00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:17.310\nconditioned good operating state right,\nwhat is normal.\n\n208\n00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:20.877\nFor that, and if that is normal,\nhow do we then go back to normal?\n\n209\n00:10:20.877 --> 00:10:24.598\nBut before we go back to normal, and\nsay yeah, we're definitely there,\n\n210\n00:10:24.598 --> 00:10:25.566\nstep two comes in.\n\n211\n00:10:25.566 --> 00:10:29.450\nWe have to validate that what we have\ndone is actually gonna equal normal.\n\n212\n00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:33.310\nAnd so this may involve and\nlooking at things like a baseline.\n\n213\n00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:37.210\nWhat is the acceptable normal operating\nenvironment and thought process and\n\n214\n00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:38.710\ncoverage for that machine?\n\n215\n00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:40.400\nIn other words,\nhow do we know what normal is?\n\n216\n00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:44.990\nIf I say I restored a system, and\nI'm validating and certifying I did, but\n\n217\n00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.820\nI have no knowledge of what\nit looked like before.\n\n218\n00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.290\nLet me play pin the tail on the system.\n\n219\n00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:52.650\nI'll close my eyes and I'll say that's\nnormal, but how do I really know?\n\n220\n00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:54.670\nSo we do have to take this in two steps.\n\n221\n00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:56.819\nWe gotta go back to normal.\n\n222\n00:10:56.819 --> 00:11:00.271\nBut we have to validate that based on\nan understanding of what normal is,\n\n223\n00:11:00.271 --> 00:11:03.723\nand an application of that baseline,\ntypically, more often than not,\n\n224\n00:11:03.723 --> 00:11:07.140\nis what we use as a yardstick or\na measuring way to do that, yeah.\n\n225\n00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:08.520\n&gt;&gt; Now Adam, I have a question.\n\n226\n00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.260\nI know each individual situation\nis going to be unique.\n\n227\n00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.486\nBut what if we're talking about\na very small company, and\n\n228\n00:11:13.486 --> 00:11:16.039\nmaybe there's an incident that has\noccurred in a mom and pop shop.\n\n229\n00:11:16.039 --> 00:11:20.080\nAnd my step one,\nyou said step one was system restoration.\n\n230\n00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:23.028\nWhat if that directly conflicts\nwith what we spoke about earlier\n\n231\n00:11:23.028 --> 00:11:24.568\nduring our evidence gathering?\n\n232\n00:11:24.568 --> 00:11:29.297\nFor instance, if I have to take this\nmachine down to go ahead and perform my\n\n233\n00:11:29.297 --> 00:11:34.028\nimages and so forth, and it's actually\ncausing a halt in my production or\n\n234\n00:11:34.028 --> 00:11:39.632\nthat business continuity there, I mean we\nmight get put in those situations, right?\n\n235\n00:11:39.632 --> 00:11:40.885\n&gt;&gt; Very likely we could.\n\n236\n00:11:40.885 --> 00:11:43.490\nInstance response is an interesting field.\n\n237\n00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:48.090\nWe talk about the theory and\nthe thought process of what we should do,\n\n238\n00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:49.820\nwhy we should do it, how we should do it.\n\n239\n00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:53.605\nWhat the good people are supposed to\ndo to make the bad people go away, and\n\n240\n00:11:53.605 --> 00:11:56.598\nsafeguard our systems so\nthat bad things don't happen.\n\n241\n00:11:56.598 --> 00:11:59.768\nAnd we think about it from that\nperspective often, and we say, well,\n\n242\n00:11:59.768 --> 00:12:02.660\nif we just do these things\neverything will be okay.\n\n243\n00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:05.560\nBut the reality is, as we talked\nabout in not only other shows, but\n\n244\n00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.020\nwe're talking about again here because\nCherokee's asking us to focus on it.\n\n245\n00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:11.470\nAnd it's a great thing for\nus to be aware of is incident responders,\n\n246\n00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:14.082\nincident handlers,\nincident managers, right?\n\n247\n00:12:14.082 --> 00:12:16.970\nWe don't always have,\nnumber one, all the answers.\n\n248\n00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.516\nNumber two,\nwe don't always have the luxury and\n\n249\n00:12:19.516 --> 00:12:23.864\nthe capability of doing the things that we\nhave specified in our thought process and\n\n250\n00:12:23.864 --> 00:12:25.745\nour procedures and our standards.\n\n251\n00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:29.793\nThat should be done because contextually\nwe just may not be able to do them for\n\n252\n00:12:29.793 --> 00:12:31.450\na variety of reasons, right.\n\n253\n00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:35.800\nSo if, as you suggest, it's a small\nmom and pop shop chances are good,\n\n254\n00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.580\nquite honestly, they're probably not gonna\nhave a forensics capability internally.\n\n255\n00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.470\nI mean more often than not they\nmay not understand those things\n\n256\n00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:46.240\nthere may be an IT professional, and\nI'm sure they are good at what they do.\n\n257\n00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.170\nBut they may not really understand\nincident response formally.\n\n258\n00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:51.790\nThey may not understand\nforensics formally.\n\n259\n00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:55.801\nThey may know enough to be able to reboot\na system, maybe they can remove malware.\n\n260\n00:12:55.801 --> 00:12:58.350\nMaybe they're an expert,\nmaybe they know more than me.\n\n261\n00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:59.240\nIt's hard to say.\n\n262\n00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.491\nBut chances are good on average, right,\n\n263\n00:13:01.491 --> 00:13:05.608\nwe would think more often than not that\nin a smaller mom and pop environment,\n\n264\n00:13:05.608 --> 00:13:09.146\nif we're lucky to have a dedicated\nfull-time IT professional,\n\n265\n00:13:09.146 --> 00:13:13.328\nthey're probably gonna be that person\nwho knows a lot of different things and\n\n266\n00:13:13.328 --> 00:13:15.643\nknows how to do a lot\nof different things but\n\n267\n00:13:15.643 --> 00:13:19.167\nmay not be an expert in depth in\nsome of these particular things.\n\n268\n00:13:19.167 --> 00:13:19.948\n&gt;&gt; Wide but shallow.\n\n269\n00:13:19.948 --> 00:13:22.798\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\nthey may be a Swiss army knife, but\n\n270\n00:13:22.798 --> 00:13:27.230\nthey may not be able to necessarily\nget very deep in any one area.\n\n271\n00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:32.050\nAnd as a result, their activities,\nas Cherokee indicated, may be right at\n\n272\n00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:36.465\nthe time and may be really focused on\ncontinuity getting back to normal, but\n\n273\n00:13:36.465 --> 00:13:40.000\nthey may be sacrificing the ability\nto understand the forensic and\n\n274\n00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.705\nincident aspects of that\nin order to do that.\n\n275\n00:13:42.705 --> 00:13:47.125\nRestarting the system to clear an error\nessentially destroys forensics evidence,\n\n276\n00:13:47.125 --> 00:13:48.602\nbecause evidence is volatile.\n\n277\n00:13:48.602 --> 00:13:51.077\nIt's in memory when we reboot\nsomething they just appear?\n\n278\n00:13:51.077 --> 00:13:52.963\nWe shut it off and all just appears.\n\n279\n00:13:52.963 --> 00:13:55.586\nWe may not be able to understand\nhow to remove that malware,\n\n280\n00:13:55.586 --> 00:13:56.957\nyou'll see this happen a lot.\n\n281\n00:13:56.957 --> 00:14:01.268\nYou probably have heard or seen this\nhappen in systems and companies and\n\n282\n00:14:01.268 --> 00:14:03.380\nentities you've been associated\nwith as well, right.\n\n283\n00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.152\nWhere we find there's an issue,\n\n284\n00:14:05.152 --> 00:14:09.204\nany other traditional IT response when\nyou have a problem on a user point is,\n\n285\n00:14:09.204 --> 00:14:13.727\nwe'll spend maybe five to ten minutes\ndiagnosing and troubleshooting on average.\n\n286\n00:14:13.727 --> 00:14:17.613\nAnd after that, we hit the, hey,\nlet's image that machine button, and\n\n287\n00:14:17.613 --> 00:14:18.900\nproblem goes away.\n\n288\n00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:19.750\nWe don't care what it is.\n\n289\n00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:21.727\nIf we can't figure it out\nin five to ten minutes,\n\n290\n00:14:21.727 --> 00:14:22.846\nmaybe a little bit longer-\n\n291\n00:14:22.846 --> 00:14:23.655\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Depending on\n\n292\n00:14:23.655 --> 00:14:24.770\nthe size of the organization.\n\n293\n00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:29.550\nBut if we don't have an answer, this is\nnot like hey, let's get out the books and\n\n294\n00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:33.230\nlet's, we're gonna spend hours\non this thing and figure it out.\n\n295\n00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:35.239\nWe just don't have that luxury,\ntypically I mean,\n\n296\n00:14:35.239 --> 00:14:38.050\nwe gotta run a business you gotta\nmake a living people gotta work.\n\n297\n00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:40.160\nI can't spend two hours\nworking on your machine.\n\n298\n00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.220\n&gt;&gt; Trying to find that root cause.\n\n299\n00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:42.493\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, whether or not it's working.\n\n300\n00:14:42.493 --> 00:14:47.016\nI mean, if I can't figure it out in five\nor ten minutes using the five or six or\n\n301\n00:14:47.016 --> 00:14:51.670\nwhatever it is standardized things on\nthe script that helps us works off.\n\n302\n00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:55.250\nWe're gonna reimage our machine I promise\nyou the problem is gonna go away but\n\n303\n00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:58.460\nhere's the challenge with that methodology\nI often point out to my customers and\n\n304\n00:14:58.460 --> 00:14:59.400\nto my students.\n\n305\n00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.030\nYeah, that problem goes away\nfrom period to time but\n\n306\n00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:05.180\nchance we go what is called\nkicking the can down the road.\n\n307\n00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:09.050\nEssentially by reapplying an image,\nwhich is a clean baseline,\n\n308\n00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:13.250\na good generic starting point for\nthe reset on that machine.\n\n309\n00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:17.944\nThat's a great methodology if that image\nis clean and pristine, and doesn't in and\n\n310\n00:15:17.944 --> 00:15:20.124\nof itself hold the keys to the problem,\n\n311\n00:15:20.124 --> 00:15:23.119\nbecause the issue is buried\nin that image somewhere.\n\n312\n00:15:23.119 --> 00:15:27.640\nAnd we haven't addressed that, you used\nthe word, root cause of that problem.\n\n313\n00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:32.132\nAnd what we're often doing by ignoring\nour opportunity to troubleshoot and\n\n314\n00:15:32.132 --> 00:15:36.203\nrespond in depth, but rather very\nshallow response and then reset,\n\n315\n00:15:36.203 --> 00:15:39.591\nis we're essentially walking\naway from the root cause.\n\n316\n00:15:39.591 --> 00:15:43.716\nWe just don't know and don't find\nout what that root cause truly is.\n\n317\n00:15:43.716 --> 00:15:48.822\nAnd as a result of that, We lose that\nopportunity to truly respond, validate,\n\n318\n00:15:48.822 --> 00:15:54.709\nrestore, right, through response validate,\noperate, and monitor over the long term.\n\n319\n00:15:54.709 --> 00:15:57.737\nWe're essentially just jumping right to,\nhey let's just reset,\n\n320\n00:15:57.737 --> 00:16:00.992\nand we'll get 30, 60, 90 days out\nof it before it goes bad again.\n\n321\n00:16:00.992 --> 00:16:03.743\nNo big deal, we'll just reimage it again.\n\n322\n00:16:03.743 --> 00:16:04.843\nAnd that might be enough.\n\n323\n00:16:04.843 --> 00:16:08.916\nSo there are definitely reasons, times,\nand situations where this will occur,\n\n324\n00:16:08.916 --> 00:16:09.870\nno doubt about it.\n\n325\n00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:13.620\nAnd we have to be acknowledging that,\nand say, look here, this is the reality.\n\n326\n00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:17.511\nThere are many, many companies that\njust can't afford full-time IT and\n\n327\n00:16:17.511 --> 00:16:19.720\nsecurity professionals in these areas.\n\n328\n00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.216\nIt's a great expense to\na company to keep one or\n\n329\n00:16:22.216 --> 00:16:26.508\nmore people on staff that are capable of\ndoing these kind of things full-time.\n\n330\n00:16:26.508 --> 00:16:27.100\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n331\n00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.440\n&gt;&gt; You're talking about a maybe 50,\n60,000 position,\n\n332\n00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:33.410\nwho knows what they pay, depending on\nwhere you live and what you do today.\n\n333\n00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:37.170\nEven if it's more or less, it's a lot\nof money for a small, as you said,\n\n334\n00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:38.920\nmaybe a small mom and pop company.\n\n335\n00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:40.900\nRight, that's a lot of inventory, right?\n\n336\n00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:41.530\nAmong other things.\n\n337\n00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:44.080\nSo gotta think about that, and that\nbrings us to another interesting point,\n\n338\n00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.620\nwhich is contingency planning.\n\n339\n00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:48.390\nRight?\nThe idea that if we don't have\n\n340\n00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:53.190\nthose full-time skills, if we don't\nknow that we can rely on the incident\n\n341\n00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:56.390\nresponder to come in and be able to\nfigure out and root cause our problem,\n\n342\n00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:59.150\nand diagnose it and\nmake sure it's gonna get dealt with, but\n\n343\n00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:02.190\nrather, we're going to hit\nthe reset button 15 minutes in.\n\n344\n00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:05.000\nThen, we gotta have contingency\nplanning in place that says okay,\n\n345\n00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.770\nwe gotta try this, this, this and this.\n\n346\n00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:08.310\nThen, this is gonna happen.\n\n347\n00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:11.460\nAnd depending on what the outcome is,\nwe may have other branches or\n\n348\n00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:13.430\nlogic flows we have to address.\n\n349\n00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:15.395\nContingency planning is\nessentially what if?\n\n350\n00:17:15.395 --> 00:17:16.315\nWhat if this happens?\n\n351\n00:17:16.315 --> 00:17:17.445\nWhat if that happens?\n\n352\n00:17:17.445 --> 00:17:20.665\nWhat are we gonna do when things\ndon't go according to plan, right?\n\n353\n00:17:20.665 --> 00:17:24.065\nThat's really the concept of\nlet's always try to be prepared.\n\n354\n00:17:24.065 --> 00:17:26.805\nLet's anticipate, if we can,\nor if then, right?\n\n355\n00:17:26.805 --> 00:17:28.355\nSo another way of thinking about it.\n\n356\n00:17:28.355 --> 00:17:32.335\nBut we've gotta understand that not\neverything goes the way we think it will\n\n357\n00:17:32.335 --> 00:17:36.085\non paper when everything is just all good\nand we're sitting in the room going, yeah,\n\n358\n00:17:36.085 --> 00:17:38.830\nwell, if this did happen,\nwell then, we would do that.\n\n359\n00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:41.830\nIt may not work that way in the real\nworld, a lot of times we throw\n\n360\n00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:46.180\nthe playbook out of the window within the\nfirst five minutes because we show up and\n\n361\n00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:50.200\nnothing has happened in the way it says\nit should in the policy statement.\n\n362\n00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.790\nThings are just not the way\nthey're supposed to be.\n\n363\n00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:57.326\nThe good incident responder understands\nthat these are guidelines that we have to\n\n364\n00:17:57.326 --> 00:18:01.136\nadhere to and follow but that\nthe specificity of the circumstance and\n\n365\n00:18:01.136 --> 00:18:04.749\na set of issues associated with\nan incident may vary greatly, and\n\n366\n00:18:04.749 --> 00:18:07.465\nwe may not be able to go\noff that list at all times.\n\n367\n00:18:07.465 --> 00:18:08.674\nWe may have to think outside the box.\n\n368\n00:18:08.674 --> 00:18:11.390\nThere are certain rules we cannot violate.\n\n369\n00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:14.120\nWe must follow a chain\nof custody of evidence.\n\n370\n00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.710\nWe must pay attention to order of\nvolatility for evidence gathering.\n\n371\n00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:21.330\nWe must use forensically sound\nevidence handling procedures.\n\n372\n00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:26.411\nBut having said that, there's always more\nthan one way to get to the end point and\n\n373\n00:18:26.411 --> 00:18:30.985\nit's not a prescriptive, rigid\nmethodology that always wins the day.\n\n374\n00:18:30.985 --> 00:18:35.509\nI've had to deal with some incredibly\ncrazy out there, left field scenarios\n\n375\n00:18:35.509 --> 00:18:40.285\nin my career with regards to this kind of\nstuff that they just don't put in books.\n\n376\n00:18:40.285 --> 00:18:42.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They don't tell you is gonna happen.\n\n377\n00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:46.300\nAnd this is the kinda stuff that if you\ndo this long enough, you're gonna see.\n\n378\n00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.000\nIt would be great if everything was just,\nshow up, there's a desktop so\n\n379\n00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.100\nI'm gonna put malware on it.\n\n380\n00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.140\nHere's the malware file,\njust go remove it.\n\n381\n00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:55.390\nThat's easy stuff, but\nit just doesn't always happen that way.\n\n382\n00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:58.500\nAnd when it doesn't, it's fun and\nexciting, it's challenging.\n\n383\n00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.560\nI look forward to every\nday that I do this, and\n\n384\n00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.970\nI look forward to the mundane but\nalso the unusual.\n\n385\n00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:07.330\nBut the reality is, that when it does\nhappen, the people that are really good at\n\n386\n00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:11.310\nthis stuff understand that they've\nalways got a baseline set of rules and\n\n387\n00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:15.120\nassumptions and mechanisms in their\nback pocket that they can fall back on.\n\n388\n00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:18.570\nBut that they're gonna have to think\noutside that box to get the job done\n\n389\n00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:19.990\nif they wanna be successful.\n\n390\n00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:21.720\nYou gotta be better than the bad people.\n\n391\n00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:26.360\nAnd you gotta be willing to figure out how\nto do what they did to understand how to\n\n392\n00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.990\nunwind it, so you can then diagnose it and\nultimately, tell that story.\n\n393\n00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:31.680\n&gt;&gt; Adam Gordon aka The Chameleon,\n\n394\n00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.870\nto be able to evolve depending on\nthe way that that situation plays out.\n\n395\n00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:35.980\nRight?\n\n396\n00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:37.551\n&gt;&gt; I'd prefer Gila monster myself.\n\n397\n00:19:37.551 --> 00:19:39.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's just me, but\n\n398\n00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:42.300\nI'm thinking more like Komodo dragon,\nGila monster.\n\n399\n00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.770\nChameleons, they're soft and\ncuddly and they change colors.\n\n400\n00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:48.360\nYou ever see that pain\ncommercial with the chameleons?\n\n401\n00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.820\nYou ever-\n&gt;&gt; Is it like a Pantone commercial?\n\n402\n00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:53.226\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well yeah, so there's the two\nchameleons and their changing colors,\n\n403\n00:19:53.226 --> 00:19:55.354\nthey're standing on the paint,\nlittle chips.\n\n404\n00:19:55.354 --> 00:19:56.067\nYou know like the ones you get at\n\n405\n00:19:56.067 --> 00:19:56.909\nthe [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n406\n00:19:56.909 --> 00:19:57.784\n&gt;&gt; They're moving around,\nthey're changing all\n\n407\n00:19:57.784 --> 00:19:58.534\nthe different colors and their talking.\n\n408\n00:19:58.534 --> 00:20:01.518\nIt's like a husband and wife,\nI want to paint the room and,\n\n409\n00:20:01.518 --> 00:20:04.260\nso I think of that when\nI think of chameleons.\n\n410\n00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:06.370\nI'm not that warm and cuddly,\nI'm just not that fuzzy.\n\n411\n00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:07.260\nAll right so five [LAUGH]\n\n412\n00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:08.540\nmajor components of the-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n413\n00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:09.072\n&gt;&gt; IT Contingency Plan.\n\n414\n00:20:09.072 --> 00:20:11.062\nWhat is the IT Contingency Plan?\n\n415\n00:20:11.062 --> 00:20:14.270\nWe talked about contingency planning but\nreally what is it?\n\n416\n00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:15.350\nWhat is it made up of?\n\n417\n00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:16.490\nWhat do we mean?\n\n418\n00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:17.150\nWhat do we say.\n\n419\n00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:20.180\nWhat do we do?\nWhat, what, what.\n\n420\n00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:21.360\nWhat should we put on that list?\n\n421\n00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.440\nSo what are the five key things\nthat a contingency plan often is\n\n422\n00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.370\ngonna be made up of.\n\n423\n00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:27.320\nWe need supporting information.\n\n424\n00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.570\nWe need to understand detailed\nconcepts of what the plan's gonna be.\n\n425\n00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:33.500\nSo think of this as almost like the who,\nwhat, when, where, why, and how, right?\n\n426\n00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:36.080\nFive W's and the H,\ngotta answer those questions.\n\n427\n00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.610\nNotification, activation, right?\n\n428\n00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:41.790\nHow are we gonna notify and\nactivate the appropriate team members and\n\n429\n00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.870\nparticipants in the plan if the plan\nhas to be called into effect?\n\n430\n00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:47.730\nRemember, the contingency plan is,\nhey, the servers are down.\n\n431\n00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:51.440\nWe've gotta fail over\nto our alternate site.\n\n432\n00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:54.845\nThat is what we would\ntraditionally call a BC/DR event.\n\n433\n00:20:54.845 --> 00:20:58.105\nThat is a disaster recovery under\nbusiness continuity plan, but\n\n434\n00:20:58.105 --> 00:21:01.565\nit's also sometimes called a continuity\nwhich gives me a contingency plan.\n\n435\n00:21:01.565 --> 00:21:03.125\nIt just depends on who you're talking to.\n\n436\n00:21:03.125 --> 00:21:06.485\nWe're essentially talking about\nthe same kinds of activities.\n\n437\n00:21:06.485 --> 00:21:08.270\nSo these plans have to be detailed.\n\n438\n00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:11.090\nThey have to be meticulous, you have\nto be told what your role will be,\n\n439\n00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:15.050\nthere has to be notification\nmechanisms in politic, call trees and\n\n440\n00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:17.140\nthings like that are set up ahead of time.\n\n441\n00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:21.060\nWe need a recovery solution, so we have\nto understand what the steps will be\n\n442\n00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:24.760\nto drive recovery, what's the sequence\nof activities that will go on there.\n\n443\n00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.790\nStep one, do this, step two, do that.\n\n444\n00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:30.130\nSo, somebody's gotta go to\nthe recovery site, go in there,\n\n445\n00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:32.920\nturn on the power,\nset up the systems, log in.\n\n446\n00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:36.720\nReceive the tapes, load the backup data,\nsynchronize the systems.\n\n447\n00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:40.250\nThis is a detailed plan,\nyou gotta have multiple steps,\n\n448\n00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:45.050\nreconstitution or essentially restoring\nthe original state of the original site or\n\n449\n00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:48.540\nthe primary site if you're on\na secondary site or individual machine.\n\n450\n00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:53.850\nHow do we bring back to normal that\nthought process, and how do we ultimately\n\n451\n00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:58.680\nthen get to the point where we can declare\nvictory and terminate recovery options or\n\n452\n00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:02.190\nrecovery operations so we can get to\nthe point where we are back to normal?\n\n453\n00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:04.530\nHow do we know what that\nline in the sand is?\n\n454\n00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:07.650\nAnd as a result of that,\nhow do we know when we are successful?\n\n455\n00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:08.980\nThis is all part of that.\n\n456\n00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:13.200\nAnd also, the appendices, all\nthe documentation that supports the plan.\n\n457\n00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.150\nWhat is the call tree?\n\n458\n00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:15.940\nWhere is it?\nIs it in share point?\n\n459\n00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:19.390\nIs it a laminated card everybody\ncarries around with them?\n\n460\n00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:21.260\nThis is the kinda thing\nyou gotta think about.\n\n461\n00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:24.360\nI have customers, I've shared these\nstories in some of the other episodes and\n\n462\n00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.290\nother shows that I've done.\n\n463\n00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:29.360\nAnd I'll get a phone call from a customer.\n\n464\n00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:33.990\nI'm in the field and they'll say,\nhey, we're having this or\n\n465\n00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:36.420\nthat issue or funny story.\n\n466\n00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:40.640\nBy the way, stories that are funny never\nstart out by being told as funny stories.\n\n467\n00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:43.187\nWhen we say funny story at the beginning\nof a phone call in IT profession\n\n468\n00:22:43.187 --> 00:22:44.885\n[CROSSTALK] It's pretty\nmuch gonna end badly.\n\n469\n00:22:44.885 --> 00:22:47.234\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We just might as well jump to that and\n\n470\n00:22:47.234 --> 00:22:50.590\nyou might as well just get right to it and\njust tell me, yeah we messed up and\n\n471\n00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:51.650\nwe need your help.\n\n472\n00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:52.970\nCuz it's never funny.\n\n473\n00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:55.570\nWhen I hear about it I promise you\nat the end of the day I never laugh.\n\n474\n00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:56.550\nIt's just not funny.\n\n475\n00:22:56.550 --> 00:23:00.220\nIt's just your way of trying to set\nme up to tell me you made a mistake.\n\n476\n00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:01.010\nI get that, right?\n\n477\n00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:01.920\nYou didn't do what I told you to do.\n\n478\n00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.220\nIt's okay.\n\n479\n00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.310\nPeople make mistakes.\n\n480\n00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:06.750\nBut, let's just get to that\ncuz that's the cool part.\n\n481\n00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:09.040\nNot the, well,\nwould you believe that we did this,\n\n482\n00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.610\ndespite your best efforts to\nthe contrary to tell us not to?\n\n483\n00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:15.590\nSo when I get the hey, funny story, phone\ncalls, what ultimately happens in this\n\n484\n00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:20.540\nregard a lot of the times is, these days,\nespecially given the nature of technology,\n\n485\n00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:25.030\ncloud virtualization, etc., a lot of\nthis information's being stored in ECM,\n\n486\n00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:28.320\nEnterprise Content Management\nsystems today, the SharePoints,\n\n487\n00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:30.790\nthe Documentums,\nthe Websphere's of the world.\n\n488\n00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:33.530\nAnd we put these call trees,\n\n489\n00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:38.240\nthese plan appendices, the plans\nthemselves, all this stuff's electronic.\n\n490\n00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.590\nWe put it up in these systems, say, yeah,\nwell, we'll get it when we need it.\n\n491\n00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:44.590\nWell, great, what if the incident is\nthat essentially that system is gone?\n\n492\n00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:47.594\nSo, you're telling me that\neverything is there, but\n\n493\n00:23:47.594 --> 00:23:50.680\nnow that we can't get there,\nwe don't have anything.\n\n494\n00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.304\nSo, how does that work?\n\n495\n00:23:52.304 --> 00:23:54.290\n&gt;&gt; You gotta love those situations, Adam.\n\n496\n00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:58.150\nI'm telling you, you call up and\nyou call into network connectivity or\n\n497\n00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:01.120\nthe Internet is broken and then someone,\na technician, might say okay,\n\n498\n00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:02.910\nwell let's go ahead nad try\nto remote into your system.\n\n499\n00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:05.544\nAnd it's like we don't\nhave Internet connection.\n\n500\n00:24:05.544 --> 00:24:08.144\nOr, we saw last week with AWS services,\n\n501\n00:24:08.144 --> 00:24:12.284\nwhen we have those types of problems and\nthe providers are down.\n\n502\n00:24:12.284 --> 00:24:15.667\nWe're kind of stuck dead in the water and\nwe have to think back to, well,\n\n503\n00:24:15.667 --> 00:24:18.090\nour contingency plan or our plan B, right?\n\n504\n00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:20.940\n&gt;&gt; Well, you have to think back to it if\nyour contingency plan involves you making\n\n505\n00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:22.010\nsure that if that didn't work,\n\n506\n00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:24.075\nthat you have an alternate\nsomewhere that you can get to.\n\n507\n00:24:24.075 --> 00:24:24.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The laminated card.\n\n508\n00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.430\n&gt;&gt; If your contingency plan was you\nwould connect to SharePoint and\n\n509\n00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:30.320\nget the plan,\nthen that's not a good contingency plan.\n\n510\n00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:34.640\nAnd my point is that a lot of my\ncorporate customers, my customers,\n\n511\n00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:35.750\na lot of people I deal with.\n\n512\n00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:36.800\nEspecially in certain verticals,\n\n513\n00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:41.140\nI mentioned this a couple of the other\nepisodes, in the ECIH body of knowledge\n\n514\n00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:45.250\nwe've been walking through, have gone\nback to old-school analog systems.\n\n515\n00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:49.460\nThey are creating hard copies\non either microfiche, microfilm,\n\n516\n00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:54.273\njust paper records and putting them in\nfireproof file cabinets and vaults,\n\n517\n00:24:54.273 --> 00:24:56.394\nin multiple locations locally.\n\n518\n00:24:56.394 --> 00:25:00.973\nWhere if something happens and they cannot\nget to these pieces of information,\n\n519\n00:25:00.973 --> 00:25:04.200\nthey've got hard copies on\nsite that they can refer to.\n\n520\n00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:08.060\nBecause that's the only way you're gonna\nbe able to deal with a contingency that\n\n521\n00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:10.070\ninvolves massive system outage.\n\n522\n00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:12.430\nIf your plan is we're\ngonna use the systems, and\n\n523\n00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:14.440\nthe systems are affected,\nthat's not a plan.\n\n524\n00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:17.887\nThat's, you might as well just\ndeclare you're done, right.\n\n525\n00:25:17.887 --> 00:25:21.646\nDeclare no victory and essentially go home\nbecause the bad guys won because you're\n\n526\n00:25:21.646 --> 00:25:25.150\nnot gonna be able to execute your plan and\nthat's gonna be a major liability.\n\n527\n00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:27.059\nIt's a major risk for\nthe business, by the way.\n\n528\n00:25:27.059 --> 00:25:30.057\nAnd when we do audit work, and\nwe talk about this with customers,\n\n529\n00:25:30.057 --> 00:25:30.936\nwe point this out.\n\n530\n00:25:30.936 --> 00:25:34.945\nIf you can't show me your documentation\nwhen I come inside to do an audit,\n\n531\n00:25:34.945 --> 00:25:38.645\nin some form other than let me log\ninto the website and show it to you.\n\n532\n00:25:38.645 --> 00:25:41.409\nIf you don't have that backup\nto that documentation,\n\n533\n00:25:41.409 --> 00:25:44.000\nthat's a finding traditionally, today.\n\n534\n00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.510\nEnough of those, and you get to have us\ncome back and do an audit for you again,\n\n535\n00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:48.570\nbecause you failed.\n\n536\n00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:49.537\nThat's just the way it is.\n\n537\n00:25:49.537 --> 00:25:52.946\nYou don't pass Go, you don't collect $200,\nthat's a Monopoly reference for\n\n538\n00:25:52.946 --> 00:25:55.840\nthose of you out there that may or\nmay not be old enough to remember that.\n\n539\n00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So I'm reaching on the shelf,\nI'm grabbing my old Trapper Keeper.\n\n540\n00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:01.864\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, that kind of stuff, that\nessentially you need, all kidding aside,\n\n541\n00:26:01.864 --> 00:26:02.990\nyou need that kind of stuff.\n\n542\n00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:06.796\nI am constantly having this conversation\nwith customers on a regular basis.\n\n543\n00:26:06.796 --> 00:26:10.182\nWhat do you do when the call tree is\nunavailable because you can't get it on\n\n544\n00:26:10.182 --> 00:26:12.820\nyour phone cuz you can't search for\ncontacts?\n\n545\n00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:14.700\nDo you have a list somewhere?\n\n546\n00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:18.833\nIn hospitals if you look at the badges\nthat emergency responders wear, nurses,\n\n547\n00:26:18.833 --> 00:26:20.372\ndocs, especially in the.\n\n548\n00:26:20.372 --> 00:26:22.447\nOn the back of them,\nthey have a lot of things.\n\n549\n00:26:22.447 --> 00:26:24.800\nThey have codes for what the codes are.\n\n550\n00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:28.538\nThey've got phone numbers and stuff and\ninformation about things that they may\n\n551\n00:26:28.538 --> 00:26:31.282\nneed because they may not be\nable to get it in an emergency.\n\n552\n00:26:31.282 --> 00:26:34.350\nThey can't take the time to go walk\nover and look it up in a book.\n\n553\n00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:36.090\nThey gotta have it right there and\nbe able to look at it and\n\n554\n00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:39.360\ngo okay, this is the number I need for\nthe blood bank or whatever it is.\n\n555\n00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.830\nThat's the kind of mentality that we need.\n\n556\n00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:45.813\nWe need to have that stuff ready at hand,\nnot rely on the fact that electrons\n\n557\n00:26:45.813 --> 00:26:49.627\nare gonna show up and line up in\nthe right order on our screen every time.\n\n558\n00:26:49.627 --> 00:26:53.240\nBecause when that machine doesn't turn on,\nthat's endgame.\n\n559\n00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:55.173\nI mean you're done if you\ndon't have an alternate plan.\n\n560\n00:26:55.173 --> 00:26:59.143\nSo we call that also not only an incident\nplan, but we have to have what's called\n\n561\n00:26:59.143 --> 00:27:03.083\na con-ops, a contingency, or excuse me,\na continuity of operations plan.\n\n562\n00:27:03.083 --> 00:27:07.725\nHow do we continue operations even under\nthe dire circumstances we may face?\n\n563\n00:27:07.725 --> 00:27:09.896\nWe call this con-ops in\nsecurity engineering.\n\n564\n00:27:09.896 --> 00:27:12.883\nAlternate site recovery is\nessentially what con-ops or\n\n565\n00:27:12.883 --> 00:27:15.005\ncontinuity of operations is all about.\n\n566\n00:27:15.005 --> 00:27:18.300\nCold, warm, hot site, mobile site,\nmirrored site in real time.\n\n567\n00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:19.760\nWhat do we do, how do we do it?\n\n568\n00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:22.115\nWe're not gonna have that\nwhole conversation, but\n\n569\n00:27:22.115 --> 00:27:26.520\njust thinking about the logic of that is\nwhat continuity of operations is about.\n\n570\n00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:32.130\nThe BC, business continuity, and BCDR,\nis all about how do we get back to normal?\n\n571\n00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:35.467\nHow do we go to an alternate site and\nwork, and restore normalcy,\n\n572\n00:27:35.467 --> 00:27:37.176\nuntil we can either return home?\n\n573\n00:27:37.176 --> 00:27:38.945\nBecause DR, disaster recovery,\n\n574\n00:27:38.945 --> 00:27:42.669\nis about stabilizing the environment\nin the aftermath of the disaster.\n\n575\n00:27:42.669 --> 00:27:45.350\nAnd then BC is about returning to normal.\n\n576\n00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:50.441\nReturning to normal may involve going to\nan alternate site, and working there for\n\n577\n00:27:50.441 --> 00:27:55.186\na period of time, while we restore and\nfix the initial incident or concern.\n\n578\n00:27:55.186 --> 00:27:57.230\nOr it may involve just being\nable to stay where you are, and\n\n579\n00:27:57.230 --> 00:28:00.570\nsimply turning things off and turning them\nback on, or whatever the case may be.\n\n580\n00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:04.074\nBut we make this exact distinction\nbetween these activities for this reason.\n\n581\n00:28:04.074 --> 00:28:08.007\nGetting back to normal,\nbusiness continuity planning, BCP, right,\n\n582\n00:28:08.007 --> 00:28:10.008\ninvolves several specific things.\n\n583\n00:28:10.008 --> 00:28:11.735\nWe need to know what they are as well.\n\n584\n00:28:11.735 --> 00:28:16.220\nA BIA, this is impact analysis, we've\ntalked about this, why this is so critical\n\n585\n00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:20.783\nin our risk assessment, risk management,\nrisk analysis conversations early on.\n\n586\n00:28:20.783 --> 00:28:25.343\nRemember, this is the way we look at all\nservices, all systems in the business,\n\n587\n00:28:25.343 --> 00:28:28.897\nprioritize and rank them based\non importance to the business at\n\n588\n00:28:28.897 --> 00:28:31.460\na flashpoint, a given moment in time.\n\n589\n00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:36.010\nAnd then we use that priority ranking\nto drive our restoration activities.\n\n590\n00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:39.523\nSo the BIA, the output of\nthe BIA becomes the input for\n\n591\n00:28:39.523 --> 00:28:41.798\nrestoration during BCDR events.\n\n592\n00:28:41.798 --> 00:28:46.271\nBecause we have to understand what is most\nimportant and what is less important in\n\n593\n00:28:46.271 --> 00:28:50.590\na graded scale towards the bottom for\nthe business for the following reason.\n\n594\n00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:53.230\nAnd people don't often understand\nwhat I'm about to explain to you.\n\n595\n00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:55.888\nOr they miss it and misinterpret it.\n\n596\n00:28:55.888 --> 00:28:59.187\nGiven a scenario, and let's just quickly\nhave a little dialog about this.\n\n597\n00:28:59.187 --> 00:29:03.792\nSo if I said to you Cherokee, hey we've\nhad a system, massive system outage and\n\n598\n00:29:03.792 --> 00:29:06.010\nwe need to start restoring services.\n\n599\n00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:09.890\nSo we have done our BIA, right, we've\ndone our Business Impact Analysis, and\n\n600\n00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:10.640\nwe have a ranking.\n\n601\n00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:14.145\nLet's just say that in most companies,\nemail is either the number one or\n\n602\n00:29:14.145 --> 00:29:15.815\nnumber two, more often than not.\n\n603\n00:29:15.815 --> 00:29:18.530\nVOIP maybe right up there with\nemail depending on what you do.\n\n604\n00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:21.923\nWeb [COUGH] excuse me, web services\nright up there, so something like that.\n\n605\n00:29:21.923 --> 00:29:23.500\nBut let's just say it's email, and then-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n606\n00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:25.670\n&gt;&gt; It's web services, and\nit's VOIP, one, two three.\n\n607\n00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:28.410\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n&gt;&gt; So given that order,\n\n608\n00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:31.250\nwould we want to restore\nthe most critical,\n\n609\n00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:34.890\nbeing email, would we wanna restore\nthe most critical service first?\n\n610\n00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:38.150\n&gt;&gt; Or we would want to start\nwith lower-level services, and\n\n611\n00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:40.435\nthen restore up the chain\ntoward the most critical?\n\n612\n00:29:40.435 --> 00:29:42.270\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What do you think we would want to do?\n\n613\n00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:45.043\n&gt;&gt; I feel like you're giving\nme a trick question here, but\n\n614\n00:29:45.043 --> 00:29:47.816\nif I were sitting there\nbleeding out in emergency room,\n\n615\n00:29:47.816 --> 00:29:50.719\nI'd want someone to work on me first,\nthe most critical.\n\n616\n00:29:50.719 --> 00:29:54.546\n&gt;&gt; Okay so from a triage perspective,\nwhen we deal with life safety, absolutely.\n\n617\n00:29:54.546 --> 00:29:56.420\nBut this is the exact opposite approach.\n\n618\n00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:59.709\nAnd this is the dialogue that\nactually almost everybody has and\n\n619\n00:29:59.709 --> 00:30:03.192\nmore often than not quite honestly\nrespond the way Cherokee does.\n\n620\n00:30:03.192 --> 00:30:06.333\nWhich is most people think logically in\nour minds, well, it's the most critical\n\n621\n00:30:06.333 --> 00:30:10.040\nthing, let's get that back up and running,\nright, cuz we need that, we need email.\n\n622\n00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:12.530\nBut here's the problem, and\nthis is what most people don't understand.\n\n623\n00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:16.181\nWhere not dealing with as Cherokee\nindicated maybe a life safety issue where,\n\n624\n00:30:16.181 --> 00:30:19.000\nyeah, if I'm horribly injured and\nyou've got a hangnail,\n\n625\n00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.510\nwe should probably take\ncare of me first right.\n\n626\n00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:24.428\nAbsolutely, in that case no doubt about\nit, I don't disagree with Cherokee at all.\n\n627\n00:30:24.428 --> 00:30:27.730\nBut when we think about restoring\nservices it's a little bit different.\n\n628\n00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:30.641\nIf i was to restore the most\ncritical system to the business,\n\n629\n00:30:30.641 --> 00:30:34.521\nemail in our example, first, and I have\nnot stabilized the environment fully,\n\n630\n00:30:34.521 --> 00:30:36.090\nmaybe I missed something.\n\n631\n00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:37.587\nMaybe there's still malware,\n\n632\n00:30:37.587 --> 00:30:41.079\nmaybe there's a bad actor that's put\na remote access trojan in a system and\n\n633\n00:30:41.079 --> 00:30:44.145\nis waiting for us to bring it back up so\nthey can take it down again.\n\n634\n00:30:44.145 --> 00:30:45.750\nWho knows what that is, variety of things.\n\n635\n00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:49.448\nMy point is, if stabilization and\nverification and validation has not\n\n636\n00:30:49.448 --> 00:30:53.760\nbeen totally successful, if we have not\nmitigated all the risks and minimized them\n\n637\n00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:57.701\nto the best of our abilities, and\nwe bring back up that most crucial system,\n\n638\n00:30:57.701 --> 00:31:00.988\nwe may actually make the incident worse,\nrather than better.\n\n639\n00:31:00.988 --> 00:31:04.860\nBecause we may have tanked a system\nthat survived the initial onslaught.\n\n640\n00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:07.791\nAnd exposed it to the attacker to\nallow them to essentially take it out\n\n641\n00:31:07.791 --> 00:31:08.456\npermanently.\n\n642\n00:31:08.456 --> 00:31:12.796\nSo it's the exact opposite methodology,\nwe actually want to start with the lowest\n\n643\n00:31:12.796 --> 00:31:15.170\nlevel systems and\nrestore in reverse order.\n\n644\n00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:16.650\nBecause if we blow up the color printer,\n\n645\n00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:19.566\nchances are good nobody's going to care\nright, on our way towards restoring,\n\n646\n00:31:19.566 --> 00:31:22.063\ncoloring printing being lower on\nthe list right, traditionally.\n\n647\n00:31:22.063 --> 00:31:26.744\nBut if we do that, and that's okay,\nthen let's add the next level.\n\n648\n00:31:26.744 --> 00:31:28.720\nLet's put the photocopier on.\n\n649\n00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:29.998\nLet's turn on the coffee maker.\n\n650\n00:31:29.998 --> 00:31:31.486\nAnd that's really critical, by the way.\n\n651\n00:31:31.486 --> 00:31:35.170\nCoffee is near the top, so we don't\nwanna blow that up if we can avoid that.\n\n652\n00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:39.560\nBut my point is, you restore in reverse\norder so that way as you build stability\n\n653\n00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:43.230\nand build reliability back into\nthe system, and we build security\n\n654\n00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:46.900\nback into the system and safeguards,\nand we know things are running well.\n\n655\n00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:49.780\nWe feel more confident turning\non those higher-level systems.\n\n656\n00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:52.562\nSo, it would be the exact\nopposite of that thought process.\n\n657\n00:31:52.562 --> 00:31:54.653\nAnd so, the BIA helps us to do this and\n\n658\n00:31:54.653 --> 00:31:58.173\nthis is a very crucial part of\nbusiness continuity planning.\n\n659\n00:31:58.173 --> 00:32:00.610\nRisk assessment, risk management,\nmentioned these.\n\n660\n00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:02.204\nWe talked a lot about these and\nwhat they are.\n\n661\n00:32:02.204 --> 00:32:04.318\nRisk monitoring, risk, risk, risk.\n\n662\n00:32:04.318 --> 00:32:09.177\nEverything that we do with regards to\nBCP is about dealing with minimizing and\n\n663\n00:32:09.177 --> 00:32:13.676\naddressing risk in a fundamental way\nto understand how to minimize it.\n\n664\n00:32:13.676 --> 00:32:14.875\nRemember, we can never zero it out.\n\n665\n00:32:14.875 --> 00:32:16.878\nThere's always residual risk left over.\n\n666\n00:32:16.878 --> 00:32:18.874\nSo when we deal with incident recovery,\n\n667\n00:32:18.874 --> 00:32:22.159\nwe have to understand it's we're\ngonna do our best to deal with and\n\n668\n00:32:22.159 --> 00:32:26.150\naddress the risks, that led to the\nvulnerability being realized, the weakness\n\n669\n00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:29.900\nbeing addressed, and exploited by\nthe threat source, the bad actor.\n\n670\n00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:32.770\nWe have to identify that,\ntry to minimize that, but\n\n671\n00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:36.100\nunderstand there may be other\nvulnerabilities that we are not aware of.\n\n672\n00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:38.290\nThere could be other circumstances\nwe have not foreseen or\n\n673\n00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:41.030\nunderstood that will lead\nto future compromise.\n\n674\n00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:43.960\nThis is not about, let's make\nthe world safe forever, I wish it was,\n\n675\n00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:45.440\nit would be great, but it's not.\n\n676\n00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:49.990\nIt's about, let's make our world\nas safe as we can make it today.\n\n677\n00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:52.570\nAnd let's stand on that fence,\nlet's stand on that border,\n\n678\n00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:56.620\nlet's stand on that perimeter and\nbe ever vigilant, ever watchful.\n\n679\n00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:59.580\nAnd try to ensure to\nthe best of our abilities,\n\n680\n00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:01.360\nthat they don't fool us again, right?\n\n681\n00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:04.250\nI mean, that's the thing,\nfool me once, right shame on me,\n\n682\n00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:06.730\nfool me twice, right, shame on you.\n\n683\n00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:07.600\nNo, that's backwards, right?\n\n684\n00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:08.943\nYeah, I always get them backwards, right?\n\n685\n00:33:08.943 --> 00:33:11.450\nFool me once, shame on you,\nfool me twice, shame on me, right?\n\n686\n00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:12.490\nI didn't do my job,\n\n687\n00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:15.931\nI really always do get that backwards\nevery time I do that, right?\n\n688\n00:33:15.931 --> 00:33:17.931\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I didn't do my job I was not paying\n\n689\n00:33:17.931 --> 00:33:18.630\nattention.\n\n690\n00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:21.615\nIf you get by me twice with the same\nexact exploit doing the same thing,\n\n691\n00:33:21.615 --> 00:33:22.890\nI should be better than that.\n\n692\n00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:24.690\nYou need to be better than that,\n\n693\n00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:28.100\nif you're gonna be successful\nat doing incident recovery.\n\n694\n00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:31.939\nBecause you have to understand that the\nincident recovery plan is the statement\n\n695\n00:33:31.939 --> 00:33:32.511\nof action,\n\n696\n00:33:32.511 --> 00:33:36.480\nthat we're gonna execute on relentlessly\nto return to normal after an incident.\n\n697\n00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:39.298\nWe gotta know this, and we gotta\nunderstand how to plan for this, and\n\n698\n00:33:39.298 --> 00:33:42.570\nwe've gotta understand that incident\nrecovery planning is really a process.\n\n699\n00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:46.260\nAnd let's just walk through what that\nprocess looks like looks like while we're\n\n700\n00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:48.390\nwrapping up, but\nwe gotta execute the steps.\n\n701\n00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:49.230\nIf we're not doing this and\n\n702\n00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:53.050\ndoing it well, then things are just\ngonna go from bad to worse very quickly.\n\n703\n00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:56.314\nAnd they're gonna continue to go from bad\nto worse on a regular basis cuz we're not\n\n704\n00:33:56.314 --> 00:33:57.508\ngonna get ahead of the curve.\n\n705\n00:33:57.508 --> 00:34:00.210\nSo what does incident recovery\nplanning ultimately look like?\n\n706\n00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:03.830\nTalked a lot about the thought process,\nbut what are those steps?\n\n707\n00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:07.090\nGotta establish the insider response team,\ngotta know the players.\n\n708\n00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:07.870\nWho's gonna help us out?\n\n709\n00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:09.230\nWho are the knowledge experts?\n\n710\n00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:10.156\nWho do we need?\n\n711\n00:34:10.156 --> 00:34:14.324\nI talked about the Mission Impossible\nanalogy in one of the other episodes,\n\n712\n00:34:14.324 --> 00:34:18.426\nwhere Daniel and I were talking and\nI explained the old school, old style,\n\n713\n00:34:18.426 --> 00:34:21.310\nold TV show way of dealing\nwith Mission Impossible.\n\n714\n00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:23.840\nI don't know if you ever saw the old\nTV show, the black and white TV show,\n\n715\n00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:28.240\nbut if you ever saw the original TV\nshow episodes, you had Mr. Phelps.\n\n716\n00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:32.000\nHe would get his assignment,\nhe would then open up his portfolio of\n\n717\n00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.840\nMission Impossible team members,\nthe impossible mission force.\n\n718\n00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:36.375\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n719\n00:34:36.375 --> 00:34:39.527\nthey would pull out the pictures and\nactually throw the portfolio pictures on\n\n720\n00:34:39.527 --> 00:34:42.112\nthe table, to show you who is\ngonna be on that week's episode.\n\n721\n00:34:42.112 --> 00:34:44.880\nAnd it's that idea of picking\nyour team members, right?\n\n722\n00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:46.646\nWho's the expert in databases?\n\n723\n00:34:46.646 --> 00:34:48.700\nWho's the expert in whatever?\n\n724\n00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:50.770\nAnd I want those people,\nI gotta build my team.\n\n725\n00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:53.453\nPerform risk assessments and\nbusiness impact analysis, so\n\n726\n00:34:53.453 --> 00:34:55.250\ntalked all about that just a minute ago.\n\n727\n00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:58.490\nAssign responsibilities to team members,\nwho's doing what?\n\n728\n00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:00.440\nHey I want to be the Firewall person,\nit's what I want to do,\n\n729\n00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:01.850\nthat's my area of expertise.\n\n730\n00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:06.770\nSo my responsibility now on paper,\nin the org chart, in the plan is\n\n731\n00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:09.130\ngonna be to deal with Firewall\nrelated incidents and occurrences.\n\n732\n00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:12.160\nSo you gotta know who to call,\nwho do you call?\n\n733\n00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:12.700\n&gt;&gt; Ghostbusters.\n\n734\n00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:14.484\n&gt;&gt; There you go,\nGhostbusters, exactly right.\n\n735\n00:35:14.484 --> 00:35:18.514\nDevelop policies and procedures,\ngotta have the overarching guidance\n\n736\n00:35:18.514 --> 00:35:22.090\nfrom senior leadership,\nsenior management, stake holders.\n\n737\n00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:27.030\nAnd we gotta have the detailed drill down\nprocess and procedures that are gonna take\n\n738\n00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:31.060\nstrategy, operationalize and ultimately\ncreate tactical elements for them.\n\n739\n00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:34.660\nSo we can deal with and\nrespond at the point of inflection and\n\n740\n00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:37.430\nreally understand how to\nimmediately do what we need to do.\n\n741\n00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:40.910\nDocument those procedures, we don't\ndocument stuff, we're not doing our job.\n\n742\n00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:43.859\nIt can't be tribal knowledge\nwalking around in someone's head,\n\n743\n00:35:43.859 --> 00:35:45.184\nit's gotta be written down.\n\n744\n00:35:45.184 --> 00:35:48.160\nThat way we can standardize it,\neverybody understands how to do it.\n\n745\n00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:52.610\nAnd everybody knows that they need to show\nup and do these five things this way for\n\n746\n00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:53.480\nthis reason.\n\n747\n00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:56.138\nDocumentation is so\ncritical to what we do.\n\n748\n00:35:56.138 --> 00:35:59.488\nOrganize and get organized to handle\nincidents, have all the tools,\n\n749\n00:35:59.488 --> 00:36:02.949\nthe techniques, the knowledge,\nmake sure you got your go bag, right,\n\n750\n00:36:02.949 --> 00:36:04.560\nyour deployment kit ready to go.\n\n751\n00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:08.410\nAs an incident responder, you're gonna\nget called out to a variety of scenes,\n\n752\n00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:11.910\na lot of times at strange hours,\nyou gotta carry with you your laptop and\n\n753\n00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:12.850\nwhatever else you may need.\n\n754\n00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:16.320\nI don't know if you're a fan of NCIS,\nif you watch that TV show or\n\n755\n00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:19.140\nnot, but if you've ever seen it,\nyou know that whenever they get called\n\n756\n00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:21.390\nout to a crime scene they all\ngrab their backpacks, right?\n\n757\n00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:23.350\nThey go running out the door\nbecause that's their go bag.\n\n758\n00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:24.780\nAnd that's the term you often here.\n\n759\n00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:29.580\nSo my go bag consists of my little held\ntogether laptop and some electrical tape,\n\n760\n00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:32.130\nin case I need to make\nrepairs in the field.\n\n761\n00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:36.446\nI have a couple of laptops and a tablet\nI travel with, a variety of cables,\n\n762\n00:36:36.446 --> 00:36:40.294\nI have network cables, power cables,\nUSB cables, you name it.\n\n763\n00:36:40.294 --> 00:36:42.640\nI've got a million thumb\ndrives just stuck in there so\n\n764\n00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.630\nI have random stuff that\nI can use if I need to.\n\n765\n00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:47.370\nAnd I've got some other odds and\nends, right?\n\n766\n00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:49.702\nThat's essentially the bag I\ntravel with wherever I go.\n\n767\n00:36:49.702 --> 00:36:50.806\n&gt;&gt; All of your software tools,\nlike you showed us.\n\n768\n00:36:50.806 --> 00:36:52.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'll usually have software tools.\n\n769\n00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:55.410\nSo I'll have that stuff either on one or\nmore machines, or I'll have it on\n\n770\n00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:58.340\nan external drive, that's some\nexternal USB drives, things like that.\n\n771\n00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:02.270\nSo I have all that stuff, that's all\npart of my, organized to handle incident\n\n772\n00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:05.246\nmethodology and mentality,\nin my step, that's in my go bag.\n\n773\n00:37:05.246 --> 00:37:08.122\nYou gotta think that out, or think that\nthrough, rather, and have that available.\n\n774\n00:37:08.122 --> 00:37:11.757\nTest, train, and rehearse,\ncan't say enough, and I've said a lot,\n\n775\n00:37:11.757 --> 00:37:12.836\nI'm gonna say more.\n\n776\n00:37:12.836 --> 00:37:17.147\nCan't say enough times, how important\nawareness, and training, and availability\n\n777\n00:37:17.147 --> 00:37:20.940\nof information is for those that have\nto participate, gotta focus on that.\n\n778\n00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:25.040\nAnd finally, ongoing management, just\noversight, this is the governance risk and\n\n779\n00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:26.540\ncompliance conversation.\n\n780\n00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:31.100\nDue care and due diligence, making sure\nultimately that we are overseeing this,\n\n781\n00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:33.130\nand that it is being refreshed and\nupdated and\n\n782\n00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:37.430\nrefined as necessary, to address ongoing\nthreats and concerns in the business.\n\n783\n00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:38.480\nVery, very important.\n\n784\n00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:41.550\nSo we want to make sure we understand\nthe steps involved with incident recovery.\n\n785\n00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:44.669\nWant to know and\nunderstand the general thought process,\n\n786\n00:37:44.669 --> 00:37:48.310\nas Cherokee reminded us in\nthe beginning the link back to BCDR.\n\n787\n00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:50.202\nThe importance of risk management and\n\n788\n00:37:50.202 --> 00:37:53.048\nbusiness impact analysis\nwith regards to restoration.\n\n789\n00:37:53.048 --> 00:37:57.186\nAnd the concept of contingency planning\nand continuity of operations all very\n\n790\n00:37:57.186 --> 00:38:00.360\nimportant with regards to\nwhat we talk about here.\n\n791\n00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:03.658\n&gt;&gt; Yes, Adam, thank you for pointing out\nthe relationship there, and also really\n\n792\n00:38:03.658 --> 00:38:08.550\noutlining those post-incident activities\nthat we should be paying attention to,\n\n793\n00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:10.780\nshortly there after that\nincident has occurred.\n\n794\n00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:13.706\nAnd thank you so much, ladies and\ngentlemen for tuning in today, but\n\n795\n00:38:13.706 --> 00:38:15.586\nthat's about it for this particular show.\n\n796\n00:38:15.586 --> 00:38:17.868\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nsign off as your host, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n797\n00:38:17.868 --> 00:38:19.068\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n798\n00:38:19.068 --> 00:38:20.718\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here, at ITPRO.TV.\n\n799\n00:38:20.718 --> 00:38:28.496\n[MUSIC]\n\n800\n00:38:28.496 -->

00:00:12.266\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPROTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.718\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your ECIH series.\n\n5\n00:00:14.718 --> 00:00:17.182\nI'm show your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.182 --> 00:00:19.852\nIn this episode,\nwe will be looking at security and law.\n\n7\n00:00:19.852 --> 00:00:23.910\nAnd I'm really thankful to have Mr Adam\nGordon in studios today because, well,\n\n8\n00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.669\nsome of these topics can get a little\nconfusing when we're looking at legal\n\n9\n00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:28.880\nstatutes and so forth.\n\n10\n00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.020\nSo thank you so much for joining us today.\n\n11\n00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.545\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\nIt's always nice to\n\n12\n00:00:32.545 --> 00:00:36.681\nget to hang out on a lovely day such as\ntoday and talk about things that are so\n\n13\n00:00:36.681 --> 00:00:40.040\nimportant to what we do with\nregards to incident handling.\n\n14\n00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.640\nThroughout the series we've been\ngoing through around the ECIH body of\n\n15\n00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.660\ninformation, we've spoken about so\nmany different topics that help incident\n\n16\n00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.380\nresponders, incident manager, incident\nhandlers to be successful at what they do.\n\n17\n00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.820\nTalk about methodology,\n\n18\n00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.840\ntalk about strategy, talked about\nprocedure, talked about policy.\n\n19\n00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.340\nTalked about all these different things\nthat we have to become masters of and\n\n20\n00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.020\nunderstand how to deploy.\n\n21\n00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.890\nIn order to, not only take care\nof the immediate issues and\n\n22\n00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.920\nconcerns associated with incident\nresponse, but broadly understand how to\n\n23\n00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.550\ndiagnose and treat the underlying risk\nsituations and vulnerabilities that lead\n\n24\n00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.350\nto these exposures in the first place,\nand mitigate them.\n\n25\n00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.390\nAnd we've hopefully done\na good job of doing that.\n\n26\n00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.490\nYou'll of course, be the judge of that\nas you go through our material and\n\n27\n00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.130\nhelp yourselves and those around you\nbecome better at incident response.\n\n28\n00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.080\nBut the capstone to this,\nkinda the whole thing coming together,\n\n29\n00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.985\nthe whole enchilada as they say,\nis really about security policy and law.\n\n30\n00:01:34.985 --> 00:01:37.325\nAnd as Cherokee was talking\nabout as we got started,\n\n31\n00:01:37.325 --> 00:01:39.255\nit is sometimes a complicated subject.\n\n32\n00:01:39.255 --> 00:01:41.715\nBut the thing that you have to\nreally remember, thing you and\n\n33\n00:01:41.715 --> 00:01:43.865\nI were chatting a little bit\nabout before we got started,\n\n34\n00:01:43.865 --> 00:01:46.585\nis while it can be sometimes\na little confusing.\n\n35\n00:01:46.585 --> 00:01:50.585\nThere are some things that people may\nassume or perhaps view one way and\n\n36\n00:01:50.585 --> 00:01:52.625\nmaybe it is or is not the case.\n\n37\n00:01:52.625 --> 00:01:56.170\nIt's the most important thing that you\ncan do, which is to ask the questions.\n\n38\n00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.430\nHey how do I clarify that?\n\n39\n00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.640\nWhat does that mean?\n\n40\n00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.690\nIs this the way I interpret that?\n\n41\n00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.250\nDoes that make sense?\n\n42\n00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.500\nOr am I perhaps seeing it in\na way that doesn't make sense?\n\n43\n00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.800\nAnd can I then broaden that\ninterpretation, understand it so\n\n44\n00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.185\nthat it is applicable, right?\n\n45\n00:02:10.185 --> 00:02:13.410\nAnd it's the idea that we don't wanna\nassume, we've often talked about this, but\n\n46\n00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.840\nrather we wanna clarify.\n\n47\n00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.440\nBecause if we ask and we clarify,\nwe're gonna be able to not only speak\n\n48\n00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.660\nknowledgeably for ourselves, but also give\nguidance, which is one of the key things\n\n49\n00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.920\nwe have to do, to those around us so\nthat they act in the right way.\n\n50\n00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.520\nThey expect the right responses, and they\ndo the right things at the right time for\n\n51\n00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.780\nthe right reasons.\n\n52\n00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.740\nAnd so it's clarity of purpose,\nclarity of execution that we seek here.\n\n53\n00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.260\nWhen we talk about, for instance in\nprior episodes, forensic examination and\n\n54\n00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.150\nforensic thought processes around data\nmanagement and incident response.\n\n55\n00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.900\nWe talked about a methodology that has to\nbe followed and a way of doing things that\n\n56\n00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.220\nif executed meticulously and methodically\nand standardized in its approach,\n\n57\n00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.080\nwill lead to the positive outcomes,\ngood results we want.\n\n58\n00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.600\nWhich is we can procure, say that three\ntimes fast, we can procure evidence but\n\n59\n00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.550\ndo so in a way that allows us to have\nthe opportunity to present that evidence\n\n60\n00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.280\nin a court of law if required to at\nthe end of some sort of a process.\n\n61\n00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.710\nSo it's about understanding\nthe mechanics and\n\n62\n00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.260\nthe definitional criteria\nthat we operate under.\n\n63\n00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.950\nThat's what we're gonna spend some\ntime talking about here, right.\n\n64\n00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.760\nSecurity policies, as we know,\nare really the basis for what we do.\n\n65\n00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.730\nWe've defined them in IT,\nin incident response,\n\n66\n00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.700\nas the strategic statements of intent that\nanswers primary two questions primarily.\n\n67\n00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.350\nThe why and the what,\nreally gives us guidance and alignment\n\n68\n00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.640\nfrom senior leadership stakeholders in the\nbusiness that are at the highest levels.\n\n69\n00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.810\nShows us the requirements the business is\nchasing and how to align to support them.\n\n70\n00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.620\nAnd gives us guidance to\nwhy we're doing things and\n\n71\n00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.840\nwhat we're gonna do in\norder to be aligned.\n\n72\n00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.470\nSo we have to think\nabout what policy is and\n\n73\n00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.320\nunderstand policy as the launching pad.\n\n74\n00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.760\nThe starting point for\nour conversations with regards to,\n\n75\n00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.690\nhow do we then bring law in from\nthe outside, whether it's the 4th\n\n76\n00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.480\nAmendment of the US Constitution,\nwhether it's the Privacy Protection Act.\n\n77\n00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.793\nAnd we'll talk about these things, you may\nor may not know what they are, but you\n\n78\n00:04:13.793 --> 00:04:17.350\ncertainly benefit from them if you live\nin the United States on a regular basis.\n\n79\n00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.560\nEven if you don't,\n\n80\n00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.460\nyou still need to understand the general\nthought processes associated with these.\n\n81\n00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.880\nSo we'll speak about these\nin just a couple of minutes.\n\n82\n00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.970\nBut characteristics of good security\npolices, as we've talked about before,\n\n83\n00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.640\nare really important for\nus to understand and to hit on.\n\n84\n00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.850\nSo Cherokee, if I said to you,\nwhat from your perspective,\n\n85\n00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.830\nright, do you think would be\nsome of the characteristics,\n\n86\n00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.750\nsome of the things that would us\nto make up good security policies?\n\n87\n00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.170\nWhat would be on your list?\n\n88\n00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.570\n&gt;&gt; Well, first of all, I would try to be\nas detailed as possible because I'd wanna\n\n89\n00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.810\ninclude systems that I was going to\nprotect, how I was going to protect them,\n\n90\n00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.250\nwhat I was not going to protect.\n\n91\n00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.740\nI guess kind of a scope,\nif I were in project management,\n\n92\n00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:53.690\nif I wanted to compare it that way.\n\n93\n00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.570\n&gt;&gt; So, scope or statement of work, right,\nin terms of that or a project charter.\n\n94\n00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.860\nAnd all those things together really\nare combined to gives us that scooping and\n\n95\n00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.370\ntailoring, that focus and\nthat ability to be able to be specific\n\n96\n00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.270\nabout the things we do and\ndon't wanna include.\n\n97\n00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.250\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so those are gonna be important.\n\n98\n00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.050\nSo we have to understand that.\n\n99\n00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.930\nShould policies be broadly communicated,\nwidely understood?\n\n100\n00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.390\n&gt;&gt; I think that that's normally\nsomething that is communicated,\n\n101\n00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.060\nprobably with that on-boarding process.\n\n102\n00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.730\nAt least that's how I would\ndo it if you were to task me.\n\n103\n00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.970\nSo having good communication with\nthe human resource department, or\n\n104\n00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.040\nmaybe you have some other\nindividual to explain.\n\n105\n00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.980\nAnd then offer that employee the ability\nto ask questions for anything that might\n\n106\n00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.890\nhave been included in that security\npolicy that they did not understand.\n\n107\n00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:42.890\nBecause I would probably,\nmost definitely want their signature so\n\n108\n00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:46.710\nthat there wasn't any kind of argument\nafterwords looking like, I didn't know or\n\n109\n00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:47.670\nI didn't understand.\n\n110\n00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.750\nAnd we could say, look,\nyou had ample opportunity.\n\n111\n00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:50.920\nHow does that sound?\n\n112\n00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:51.800\n&gt;&gt; So, acknowledgement, sure.\n\n113\n00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.030\nSo some sort of ability to be able\nto communicate broadly and widely,\n\n114\n00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.940\nstandardizing, and then\nacknowledgement of said communication.\n\n115\n00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.660\nThe only thing I would add from what you\nsaid, and I agree 100% with what you said,\n\n116\n00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.440\nbut we just wanna broaden\nthat out just a little bit.\n\n117\n00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.830\nIt would certainly be a good idea to\ndo first touch at point of intake,\n\n118\n00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.800\nif you will, right, so\nnew employees on-boarding.\n\n119\n00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.270\nAlways good to get that out of\nthe way right up front, but\n\n120\n00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.870\nthis needs to be an on-going discussion,\ndialogue of a business, right.\n\n121\n00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.810\nSo we don't train once, and then walk away\nand say well five years nothing's changed,\n\n122\n00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.690\nyou should know that,\nright, you remember, right?\n\n123\n00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.590\nWe have to do this in an ongoing way, and\nso it's about not just the initial touch,\n\n124\n00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.480\nas Cherokee points out, but\nit's also about the ongoing\n\n125\n00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.500\neffort to create awareness and\nrefresh that training.\n\n126\n00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.910\nMaybe once a year, maybe twice a year.\n\n127\n00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.050\nIt depends, there's no right and\n\n128\n00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.920\nwrong with regards to wow, we must do this\nevery quarter versus we do it once a year.\n\n129\n00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.780\nBut there has to be some sort of on going\neffort on the part of the organization\n\n130\n00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.440\nto not only substantiate their claim\nif they have a standardized process\n\n131\n00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.360\nthrough policy.\n\n132\n00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.400\nBut that everybody understands it,\nwhen there are changes\n\n133\n00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.990\npush those updates out and make sure\nthey're broadly and widely communicated.\n\n134\n00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.080\nSo, very important.\n\n135\n00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.610\nWe have to make sure policy is auditable,\nso we have a way to verify and\n\n136\n00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:01.520\nvalidate that.\n\n137\n00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.190\nSo it's got to be enforceable with\ntools and some sort of technique and\n\n138\n00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.020\nprocess that allows us to say yes or\nno definitively somebody is or\n\n139\n00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.730\nis not following that policy.\n\n140\n00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.910\nSo these are gonna be things\nthat we have to understand and\n\n141\n00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.360\nthink about as characteristics.\n\n142\n00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.400\nHaving said that, a lot of people often\nstruggle with how do I create a policy?\n\n143\n00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.980\nWhere do I find the requirements,\nthe methodology,\n\n144\n00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.610\nthe thought process,\nthe templating to do so?\n\n145\n00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:30.060\nI remember starting out, and I've talked\nabout this in another episode before with\n\n146\n00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:34.540\nyou, I remember starting out many,\nmany moons ago now as we talk about.\n\n147\n00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.760\nDecades ago in this industry,\n\n148\n00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:41.650\nwhen there was no easily accessible,\nhey, go out and Google it kind of thing.\n\n149\n00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:42.420\nYou wanted to find it,\n\n150\n00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:46.400\nyou went to a library and then somebody\nwrite it down and publish a book on it.\n\n151\n00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.123\nYeah, you made it up.\n\n152\n00:07:47.123 --> 00:07:48.094\nI mean there just,\n\n153\n00:07:48.094 --> 00:07:51.995\nthere was no worldwide web in Internet\nthe way we think of today to go search.\n\n154\n00:07:51.995 --> 00:07:56.725\nWe take a lot of this for granted today\nbut search engines are a 2000 forward\n\n155\n00:07:56.725 --> 00:08:01.452\nmillennial kinda thing and there was a\nwhole bunch of stuff that went on prior to\n\n156\n00:08:01.452 --> 00:08:06.210\nthat, that you may or may not have been\nable to find out there for the most part.\n\n157\n00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:08.950\nAnd so when I started doing this,\nthere was nobody around\n\n158\n00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:11.060\nthat really could tell me hey\nthis is how you write a policy.\n\n159\n00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:15.270\nI had to unfortunately figure a lot\nof this out for myself the hard way.\n\n160\n00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:18.745\nI just had to do trial and error and\nover time refine it and get it right.\n\n161\n00:08:18.745 --> 00:08:22.150\nAnd now, it is so, not easier but\n\n162\n00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:27.000\nit's a lot more likely that you can find\nthings that will be beneficial to you.\n\n163\n00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.020\nBecause somebody has blazed a trail and\nhas gone to the time and\n\n164\n00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:33.360\ntrouble to put that information out there,\nto aggregate it, or\n\n165\n00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.710\nothers have done it on their behalf, so\nthat we can point you to something and\n\n166\n00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:38.891\nsay, well, if you need guidance,\nhere you go.\n\n167\n00:08:38.891 --> 00:08:42.180\nSo what I want to take just a moment\nto show you is one of those places\n\n168\n00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:45.330\nyou can go to where you can\nfind guidance around policy.\n\n169\n00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:46.920\nPolicy templates actually.\n\n170\n00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.350\nAll you have to do is download them.\n\n171\n00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:50.980\nThey are free of charge,\nWord and PDF format.\n\n172\n00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.630\nAnd all you need to do is know\nhow to cut and paste, right?\n\n173\n00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:57.150\nBecause you cut out the bracket\nthat says put policy name here and\n\n174\n00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.680\nyou put the name of the policy in there.\n\n175\n00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.390\nAnd then you can use that policy if\nyou need a starter policy kit or\n\n176\n00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:06.090\na set of templates and\nit's lovely word, we love this word.\n\n177\n00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:06.810\nFree.\n\n178\n00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:08.090\nRight?\nIt's free.\n\n179\n00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:09.788\nSo let's take a look if\nwe could real quick.\n\n180\n00:09:09.788 --> 00:09:14.303\nAnd what you'll see on the screen in front\nof you and this is in the show notes.\n\n181\n00:09:14.303 --> 00:09:15.608\nWe do have this URL for you.\n\n182\n00:09:15.608 --> 00:09:19.181\nJust a normal disclaimer around any of\nthis because, we're recording this now,\n\n183\n00:09:19.181 --> 00:09:22.936\nyou're seeing it, if you're watching it,\nif not, certainly you'll see it soon.\n\n184\n00:09:22.936 --> 00:09:26.930\nBut if you're watching this a year or who\nknows how long down the road from the time\n\n185\n00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:29.780\nwe recorded this,\nsome URLs do tend to change over time.\n\n186\n00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:31.490\nNot suggesting this one will or won't.\n\n187\n00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:34.370\nBut just common sense stuff like\nwe always wanna remind you about.\n\n188\n00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:37.500\nJust because the URL is in the show notes,\nand at the time we said, yeah,\n\n189\n00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:38.670\ngo get it there.\n\n190\n00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:41.330\nIf it's not working when you go\nto look at it, just Google it.\n\n191\n00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:45.430\nAnd you got a sense of what the page looks\nlike, where it's coming from, from SANS.\n\n192\n00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:46.520\nJust use common sense.\n\n193\n00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.640\nGoogle it, find the adjusted URL and\nthen you'll be all set.\n\n194\n00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.280\nYou'll be able to get\nthis with no trouble.\n\n195\n00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.768\nBut you'll see that SANS,\n\n196\n00:09:52.768 --> 00:09:56.930\ngreat organization, always wanna give\nthem credit whenever we talk about them.\n\n197\n00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:01.235\nThey provide so many resources to\nour community, to IT professionals.\n\n198\n00:10:01.235 --> 00:10:04.295\nAnd they do so in a variety of\ndifferent ways and formats.\n\n199\n00:10:04.295 --> 00:10:07.215\nThey run this policy template\narea on their website.\n\n200\n00:10:07.215 --> 00:10:09.085\nAll the templates here are free.\n\n201\n00:10:09.085 --> 00:10:10.945\nAs I said, you just have to download them.\n\n202\n00:10:10.945 --> 00:10:12.485\nAnd they're broken out by category.\n\n203\n00:10:12.485 --> 00:10:14.315\nYou come here and you take a look.\n\n204\n00:10:14.315 --> 00:10:15.735\nFind the policy template you need,\n\n205\n00:10:15.735 --> 00:10:19.675\nGeneral, Network Security,\nService Security, Application, etc.\n\n206\n00:10:19.675 --> 00:10:23.030\nSo if you go into something like General,\njust as a category and\n\n207\n00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:26.190\nyou see that we need something\nlike an acceptable usage policy.\n\n208\n00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:27.440\nJust click on that.\n\n209\n00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:31.570\nIt will take you, and\nmake sure to click registers, of course.\n\n210\n00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:34.770\nIt will take you down to the little area\nhere and you could see you could just\n\n211\n00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:39.550\nsimply download either one, a doc or PDF\nformat and you'll then get a several page\n\n212\n00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:42.000\ntemplate that you can use and\nfill in the blanks on.\n\n213\n00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.610\nSo this is going to help us to then\nbe able to understand how to develop\n\n214\n00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:46.210\nthese policies.\n\n215\n00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:49.930\nYou know as incident responders we often\nthink that the majority of our time and\n\n216\n00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:53.360\nfocus and\nenergy needs to be reactive after the fact\n\n217\n00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.950\naround things that have occurred and\n\n218\n00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:59.480\nunwinding them and telling those stories\nabout what went wrong and how to fix it.\n\n219\n00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.970\nThat's a very large part of what we do.\n\n220\n00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:04.910\nBut the reality of what we do is that\nif we can plan and be proactive in many\n\n221\n00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:09.350\nareas, we can more often than not prevent\nincidents from occurring or at least if\n\n222\n00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:14.020\nthey do occur, minimize their impact by\nhaving a lot of things done ahead of time\n\n223\n00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:18.650\nthat can try to mitigate and in some way\nminimize the liability and the exposure.\n\n224\n00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:22.430\nAnd so, while we don't often talk about it\nthis way, a large portion of what we need\n\n225\n00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:27.120\nto do as incident handlers is proactive\nthinking about what we need to have in\n\n226\n00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.880\nplace so that we can not only\nrespond more efficiently, but\n\n227\n00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.970\nwe can try to stop the obvious things\nthat can go wrong before they go wrong.\n\n228\n00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:39.290\nAnd so it is our job oftentimes to make\nrecommendations about and indeed probably\n\n229\n00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:44.080\ncraft and produce policies and\nupdate them on behalf of the organization.\n\n230\n00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.030\nBroadly IT security professionals,\n\n231\n00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:48.820\nIT professionals,\nmay do this in a variety of areas.\n\n232\n00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.300\nBut incident handlers may play\na part in this as well, so\n\n233\n00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.740\nit is something just to be aware of and\nto consider.\n\n234\n00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:55.240\nSo we just wanna think about that.\n\n235\n00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.520\nAnd I just thought it would be\na good idea to take the moment and\n\n236\n00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.030\nthe time just to show you where\nwe can find these things.\n\n237\n00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:03.550\nSo that if you're struggling a little bit,\nas some of us may, with how to create\n\n238\n00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:07.560\nthese, where do you get them, is it\nokay to take one off the internet and\n\n239\n00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.510\nkind of scrub it, and\ngeneralize it, and make it our own.\n\n240\n00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:12.750\nAbsolutely, as long as you go\nto a site where that is allowed.\n\n241\n00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:16.870\nAnd it's very clear in the usage policy\nassociated with downloading these\n\n242\n00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:21.260\ndocuments that SANS says absolutely and\nunequivocally use these and reuse them.\n\n243\n00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.220\nJust follow our instructions and\nmake sure you put your stuff in.\n\n244\n00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.105\nAnd they are allowed to be used and\nredistributed.\n\n245\n00:12:27.105 --> 00:12:28.005\nNo problem at all.\n\n246\n00:12:28.005 --> 00:12:29.465\nSo make sure you're aware of that.\n\n247\n00:12:29.465 --> 00:12:32.415\nWhat about some of the issues that we\nneed to consider when we think about\n\n248\n00:12:32.415 --> 00:12:35.375\ngoing to the outside and\nbringing in external entities?\n\n249\n00:12:35.375 --> 00:12:40.285\nYou know a big part of policy and\nlaw discussions around incident response\n\n250\n00:12:40.285 --> 00:12:43.805\nis not just what goes on internally\nin setting that base line, right?\n\n251\n00:12:43.805 --> 00:12:47.275\nSo Cherokee and I agree okay,\nthis is how we're gonna handle something\n\n252\n00:12:47.275 --> 00:12:49.965\nbecause it's us deciding for\nthe business what we're gonna do.\n\n253\n00:12:49.965 --> 00:12:51.080\nThat's important.\n\n254\n00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.900\nBut what about if I have to go outside and\ngo to another entity,\n\n255\n00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:57.520\ntypically law enforcement or\nsome external organization?\n\n256\n00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.640\nIs there a plan for that?\n\n257\n00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:03.310\nDo I have a procedure and\na policy in place inside the organization?\n\n258\n00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:04.450\nYou should, by the way.\n\n259\n00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:05.900\nIf you don't, that says,\n\n260\n00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:09.200\nunder these conditions,\nwe will contact law enforcement.\n\n261\n00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:13.210\nDo we have a designated spokesperson or\npoint of contact that will\n\n262\n00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:16.930\nbuild those relationships ahead of\ntime and will do the reaching out?\n\n263\n00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:18.580\nBecause, we do not want to have five or\n\n264\n00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:22.760\nsix different people calling up\nthe local law enforcement agencies,\n\n265\n00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:27.790\nwhatever they may be, the police,\nthe FBI branch in your local area.\n\n266\n00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:31.950\nWhatever that particular response is that\nyou are looking for and have five or\n\n267\n00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:34.770\nsix different cases\nwhere threads opened up\n\n268\n00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:37.190\naround the incident because\nit's gonna lead to confusion.\n\n269\n00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:40.210\nIt's gonna lead to overlapping\nclaims of jurisdiction.\n\n270\n00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:42.500\nIt's gonna to be a mess as they say,\nright?\n\n271\n00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:46.380\nSo we don't wanna do that,\nwe wanna operate with one voice,\n\n272\n00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:50.450\none thought process, look professional,\nand engage professionally.\n\n273\n00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:52.190\nAnd again, this requires prior planning.\n\n274\n00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:56.040\nWe have to have a policy\ninside the organization\n\n275\n00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:00.540\nproactively in place prior to the event\nthat specifies what those thresholds are.\n\n276\n00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.930\nTypically policies along these\nlines will spell out things like\n\n277\n00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:08.490\nthe decision to go to seek external help\nwill be a senior manager, senior level,\n\n278\n00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:11.150\nsenior stakeholder\ndecision in the business.\n\n279\n00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:14.460\nThere may be an emergency group\nthat gets together and meets.\n\n280\n00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.280\nThere may be a standing group,\nhowever you get there.\n\n281\n00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:20.440\nThere may be dollar thresholds\nassociated with certain activities that\n\n282\n00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.590\nleads you to seek outside help.\n\n283\n00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:26.540\nSomebody breaks in and steals $5,000,\nyou may or may not go and\n\n284\n00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.430\ntry to bring in law enforcement to go\nafter them, cuz chances are good they're\n\n285\n00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:33.150\njust not gonna be effective, because\nthere's just really a very small amount\n\n286\n00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.580\nof dollars involved, and\nthey may not take the case on.\n\n287\n00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:39.920\nBut if there's 100,000, 200,000, $300,000\nor more worth of damage then, yeah,\n\n288\n00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.080\nyou're gonna bring law enforcement in cuz\nyou're gonna want to go after these people\n\n289\n00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:47.810\nwhoever they were and try to seek criminal\nas well as financial remuneration,\n\n290\n00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:51.580\nsome sort of penalties and damages\nassessment against them in a court of law.\n\n291\n00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:54.970\nSo, there are reasons why we have to\nthink through this ahead of time.\n\n292\n00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:57.560\nLaw enforcement agencies\nneed to be contacted through\n\n293\n00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.380\ndesignated individuals as we said.\n\n294\n00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:03.350\nIncidents should follow whatever the\nrequired incident handling procedures are.\n\n295\n00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:07.140\nAnd if there is statutory or\nregulatory oversight in your industry,\n\n296\n00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:07.770\nin your vertical.\n\n297\n00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:11.190\nIf you work in healthcare, if you work\nin finance, if you work in insurance,\n\n298\n00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:13.780\nif you're in the communications industry.\n\n299\n00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.050\nAnd this is within the US.\n\n300\n00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:17.130\nBut globally, you could broaden this out.\n\n301\n00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:21.120\nMany of these industries are regulated\neverywhere, not just In the United States.\n\n302\n00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.970\nBiopharma, the biopharmaceutical industry.\n\n303\n00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:27.430\nMineral and natural gas and\noil extractive industries.\n\n304\n00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:30.280\nAll of these, without exception,\nare regulated worldwide.\n\n305\n00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.700\nDefense industries, right?\n\n306\n00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:35.808\nYou build missiles and planes for\na living, you're heavily overseen or\n\n307\n00:15:35.808 --> 00:15:38.915\nregulated by government or\nsupernational entities.\n\n308\n00:15:38.915 --> 00:15:43.778\nAnd there's usually a set of regulations\nand statutory requirements about things\n\n309\n00:15:43.778 --> 00:15:48.080\nthat have to be reported and\nactivities that have to be disclosed.\n\n310\n00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.492\nYou must follow those and\ncomply with those, right?\n\n311\n00:15:50.492 --> 00:15:52.817\nIt's very important to do that as well,\nright?\n\n312\n00:15:52.817 --> 00:15:53.645\nSo wanna think about those things.\n&gt;&gt; So Adam,\n\n313\n00:15:53.645 --> 00:15:58.371\nwe can't use ignorance as an excuse in\nthese particular situations because as\n\n314\n00:15:58.371 --> 00:16:02.533\nAn industry professional,\nthis is our responsibility, correct?\n\n315\n00:16:02.533 --> 00:16:07.442\n&gt;&gt; So ignorance is never an excuse,\nnever a defense as we say, before the law,\n\n316\n00:16:07.442 --> 00:16:07.990\nright?\n\n317\n00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:11.930\nSaying you don't know something is\nnot gonna get you off the hook.\n\n318\n00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:14.730\nIf you work in an industry,\nwhatever industry it is, and\n\n319\n00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:18.380\nthat industry is regulated,\nas I tell my students all the time and\n\n320\n00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:21.540\nI tell my customers on a regular basis,\nright?\n\n321\n00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:25.265\nIf you don't understand the requirements\nand the rules of how to play the game,\n\n322\n00:16:25.265 --> 00:16:29.645\nthen woe to you when somebody\ncomes calling and says, but\n\n323\n00:16:29.645 --> 00:16:31.005\nyou violated the rules, right?\n\n324\n00:16:31.005 --> 00:16:32.405\nYou don't get a free pass, in other words.\n\n325\n00:16:32.405 --> 00:16:35.515\nThere's absolutely no way you could\nclaim ignorance as an excuse and\n\n326\n00:16:35.515 --> 00:16:38.175\nhave that be a legitimating\nfactor in your defense.\n\n327\n00:16:38.175 --> 00:16:41.769\nIt just doesn't work, you are responsible.\n\n328\n00:16:41.769 --> 00:16:45.880\nEspecially in regulated environments\nto understand how to comply.\n\n329\n00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:50.417\nAnd if you don't there's usually financial\nand there may very well be criminal\n\n330\n00:16:50.417 --> 00:16:55.172\npenalties associated with negligent\nbehavior that occurs because of ignorance.\n\n331\n00:16:55.172 --> 00:16:56.772\nThat's unfortunate, there's no excuse.\n\n332\n00:16:56.772 --> 00:16:58.750\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n&gt;&gt; You can't say, hey I didn't know and\n\n333\n00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:01.721\nnext time I won't, make sure that\nsomeone doesn't drive off the cliff\n\n334\n00:17:01.721 --> 00:17:03.790\nbecause I didn't put up the warning signs.\n\n335\n00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:06.000\nYou know you're responsible,\nthat's just the way it is.\n\n336\n00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.740\nSo it's a good point to raise, but\n\n337\n00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:11.630\nit's also a very important point to\nmake sure that we understand about,\n\n338\n00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:16.838\nbecause it's our responsibility as IT\nprofessionals, as security professionals.\n\n339\n00:17:16.838 --> 00:17:18.010\nAs in instance handlers,\n\n340\n00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:21.810\nmanagers and responders we have to know\nthe play book and know the rules right.\n\n341\n00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:23.582\nIt's just like anything else\nyou show up to play the game.\n\n342\n00:17:23.582 --> 00:17:24.822\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; You've got to bring your\n\n343\n00:17:24.822 --> 00:17:25.450\ngame face, right.\n\n344\n00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:27.503\nThis is my game face.\n\n345\n00:17:27.503 --> 00:17:29.327\nSo you've got to make sure\nyou bring it with you and\n\n346\n00:17:29.327 --> 00:17:32.215\nyou've got to make sure you know\nwhat is appropriate behavior, right?\n\n347\n00:17:32.215 --> 00:17:35.595\nBecause we can't bend the rules and\nplay fast and loose.\n\n348\n00:17:35.595 --> 00:17:36.545\nWe're gonna get called on that.\n\n349\n00:17:36.545 --> 00:17:38.015\nThat's gonna definitely be an issue for\nus.\n\n350\n00:17:38.015 --> 00:17:39.955\nSo wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n351\n00:17:39.955 --> 00:17:44.147\nSpeaking of issues fast and\nloose and speaking of laws I\n\n352\n00:17:44.147 --> 00:17:46.567\nwas speaking about none of those things,\nbut I am gonna speak about them now.\n\n353\n00:17:46.567 --> 00:17:48.577\nSo let's talk for\njust a couple of minutes.\n\n354\n00:17:48.577 --> 00:17:52.967\nAnd this is the portion of our\ndiscussion where we're gonna turn and\n\n355\n00:17:52.967 --> 00:17:56.487\nreally be a little bit more focused on\nsome of the specificity of certain laws,\n\n356\n00:17:56.487 --> 00:18:00.247\ncertain acts or regulatory issues\nthat I mentioned earlier on.\n\n357\n00:18:00.247 --> 00:18:02.117\nThe fourth amendment of\nthe US Constitution,\n\n358\n00:18:02.117 --> 00:18:05.297\nthe Privacy Protection Act here in\nthe United States in particular.\n\n359\n00:18:05.297 --> 00:18:08.135\nThese are examples, and\nI wanna frame this conversation this way.\n\n360\n00:18:08.135 --> 00:18:11.837\nThis is not a, let's globalize this\nconversation and talk about privacy from\n\n361\n00:18:11.837 --> 00:18:14.993\nthe perspective of, how every\ncountry in the world deals with it.\n\n362\n00:18:14.993 --> 00:18:15.975\n&gt;&gt; Internationally.\n\n363\n00:18:15.975 --> 00:18:20.243\n&gt;&gt; Because it is different, and every\ncountry has their own take on what privacy\n\n364\n00:18:20.243 --> 00:18:25.233\nprotections, rights of the individual are,\nversus rights of the government to search,\n\n365\n00:18:25.233 --> 00:18:29.175\nand/or to interact with that\nindividual What rights are sacrosanct,\n\n366\n00:18:29.175 --> 00:18:33.390\nin other words what rights are essentially\nnot going to be protected.\n\n367\n00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:36.200\nAnd every country,\nevery entity sees this differently.\n\n368\n00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.030\nThis is not a right and\n\n369\n00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:40.690\nwrong conversation, this is not a we\ndo it better than you conversation.\n\n370\n00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:44.205\nThis is simply a frame of\nreference to begin a conversation\n\n371\n00:18:44.205 --> 00:18:47.791\nthat I would encourage you,\nwe would encourage you to think\n\n372\n00:18:47.791 --> 00:18:51.035\nabout globalizing if you\ncome from another country.\n\n373\n00:18:51.035 --> 00:18:54.620\nIf you live, practice,\nwork in an area of the world where\n\n374\n00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:57.921\nthis conversation resonates,\nbut is not the same.\n\n375\n00:18:57.921 --> 00:19:00.808\nAnd I could think of any number of\ncountries anywhere in the world that you\n\n376\n00:19:00.808 --> 00:19:03.860\nmay be watching us from either right\nnow or at some point in the future.\n\n377\n00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:06.620\nAnd we love the fact that people\nview us from all over the world,\n\n378\n00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:07.640\nit's a great thing.\n\n379\n00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.700\nThis is the beauty of technology today,\nright?\n\n380\n00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.835\nBut the reality is that there is so\n\n381\n00:19:11.835 --> 00:19:15.967\nmuch localization with regards\nto interpretation of privacy.\n\n382\n00:19:15.967 --> 00:19:20.024\nAnd rights of the individual,\nthat it would be very difficult for\n\n383\n00:19:20.024 --> 00:19:25.190\nus to have a show that talks about and\ndoes justice to, and covers adequately.\n\n384\n00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:28.118\nEvery country's approach\nto this in every subtle and\n\n385\n00:19:28.118 --> 00:19:30.665\nvery important way for\nincident responders.\n\n386\n00:19:30.665 --> 00:19:32.990\nAnd so\nI just wanna set the right expectation.\n\n387\n00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:37.620\nWe're not gonna lay down, literally,\nan interpretation here that is applicable\n\n388\n00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:41.020\nto everybody in every incident response\nscenario, regardless of where you live.\n\n389\n00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:43.866\nWe're simply just gonna talk\nbroadly about a few things that,\n\n390\n00:19:43.866 --> 00:19:47.194\nat least in the United States anyway,\nare gonna be points of reference for\n\n391\n00:19:47.194 --> 00:19:48.285\nincident responders.\n\n392\n00:19:48.285 --> 00:19:52.261\nAnd they translate out into the broad\nworld with regards to protection of rights\n\n393\n00:19:52.261 --> 00:19:56.370\nof the individual, protection of PII,\npersonally identifiable information.\n\n394\n00:19:56.370 --> 00:20:01.940\nProtection of corporate and confidential\ninformation in a variety and a plethora,\n\n395\n00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:07.207\nthere's a good SAT vocabulary word,\nplethora of different interpretation.\n\n396\n00:20:07.207 --> 00:20:10.879\nEncourage you as I do with all my\nstudents and all my customers and\n\n397\n00:20:10.879 --> 00:20:13.690\nthe people I do business with and\nwork for.\n\n398\n00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:16.074\nI encourage you to localize\nthat knowledge and\n\n399\n00:20:16.074 --> 00:20:20.474\nto understand that if you are an incident\nresponder, an IT professional, living and\n\n400\n00:20:20.474 --> 00:20:21.468\nworking in the EU.\n\n401\n00:20:21.468 --> 00:20:25.061\nYou need to understand the laws that\nregulates you in the EU as well as\n\n402\n00:20:25.061 --> 00:20:29.530\nthe country specific laws that may tweak\nthat interpretation in some cases.\n\n403\n00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:32.970\nIf you live and\nwork in Saudi Arabia, in Israel.\n\n404\n00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:34.255\nIf you live and work in Spain.\n\n405\n00:20:34.255 --> 00:20:36.490\nIf you live and work in Burundi.\n\n406\n00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:37.950\nIf you live and work in India.\n\n407\n00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:39.660\nAnywhere in the world, doesn't matter.\n\n408\n00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:41.995\nAnd my apologies if I left any of you out,\nright.\n\n409\n00:20:41.995 --> 00:20:42.633\nMention a few.\n\n410\n00:20:42.633 --> 00:20:44.710\nBut wherever you are follow those laws,\n\n411\n00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:48.320\nunderstand them locally because\nthat is your responsibility.\n\n412\n00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:52.150\nAs a professional acting in that\narea you have to uphold and\n\n413\n00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:54.930\nalign with the laws of that\nregulatory environment.\n\n414\n00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:57.710\nBottom line, end of sentence,\nnothing more to say there.\n\n415\n00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:59.530\nBecause that's how this works.\n\n416\n00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:02.964\nNow having said that let's talk a little\nbit about some of the things that\n\n417\n00:21:02.964 --> 00:21:04.155\nare specific to us here.\n\n418\n00:21:04.155 --> 00:21:07.294\n4th Amendment of the United States\nConstitution among all of the amendments\n\n419\n00:21:07.294 --> 00:21:09.127\nis one that you often\nhear talked about a lot,\n\n420\n00:21:09.127 --> 00:21:11.180\nright up there with the first amendment,\nright.\n\n421\n00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:14.931\nThe right to freedom of speech,\nvery important for many many reasons but\n\n422\n00:21:14.931 --> 00:21:19.617\nthe 4th Amendment, the right to, from our\nperspectives as individuals, as citizens.\n\n423\n00:21:19.617 --> 00:21:23.562\nSpecifically, limiting the ability of\ngovernments to search for evidence without\n\n424\n00:21:23.562 --> 00:21:27.297\na warrant, freedom from and protection\nfrom warrantless search and seizure.\n\n425\n00:21:27.297 --> 00:21:31.013\nUnreasonable, is a term you often hear,\nused and applied here,\n\n426\n00:21:31.013 --> 00:21:36.030\nunreasonable search and seizure both in\nour homes and in our effects, so to speak.\n\n427\n00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:39.810\nAnd so, we want to think about the fact\nthat enshrined in law in this country,\n\n428\n00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:43.200\nwe have, since the beginning almost,\nof this country,\n\n429\n00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.460\nhave said that there are certain rights\nthat are inalienable, as we know.\n\n430\n00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:49.780\nAnd the right to protect certain\nthings that are unique and\n\n431\n00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:51.510\nprivate to you is one of them.\n\n432\n00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:54.200\nBut there are interpretations here, right?\n\n433\n00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.580\nNot everything is always as it appears.\n\n434\n00:21:56.580 --> 00:22:00.211\nAnd while the fourth amendment of the US\nConstitution is one that is very important\n\n435\n00:22:00.211 --> 00:22:02.485\nfor us to understand specifically,\nlet me quote.\n\n436\n00:22:02.485 --> 00:22:06.905\nFourth amendment states, the right of\nthe people to be secure in their persons,\n\n437\n00:22:06.905 --> 00:22:10.415\nhouses, papers and\neffects against unreasonable searches and\n\n438\n00:22:10.415 --> 00:22:13.743\nseizures shall not be violated and\nno warrants shall issue.\n\n439\n00:22:13.743 --> 00:22:18.139\nBut upon probable cause, supported by\noath or affirmation and particularly,\n\n440\n00:22:18.139 --> 00:22:22.650\ndescribing the place to be searched and\nthe persons or things to be seized.\n\n441\n00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:25.450\nIn other words, you can't just walk up,\nknock on the door and\n\n442\n00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:26.920\nsay I represent the government.\n\n443\n00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:30.160\nGet out of the way, I'm coming in and\nI wanna grab everything that's in there.\n\n444\n00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.780\nThat's not how it works.\n\n445\n00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:35.090\nThere is an expectation that\nthat door is a dividing line.\n\n446\n00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:37.044\nBetween the outside and the inside and\n\n447\n00:22:37.044 --> 00:22:41.083\nas a result of that the government does\nhave rights but so does the individual.\n\n448\n00:22:41.083 --> 00:22:42.351\nAnd we have to balance this and\n\n449\n00:22:42.351 --> 00:22:44.805\nunderstand this is a result\nof instance response right?\n\n450\n00:22:44.805 --> 00:22:46.768\nI don't know if you're a big movie fan?\n\n451\n00:22:46.768 --> 00:22:50.097\nI know Daniel and I if you've seen any of\nour episodes those of you that know us,\n\n452\n00:22:50.097 --> 00:22:52.080\n&gt;&gt; I'm no where near as [INAUDIBLE], yes.\n\n453\n00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.019\n&gt;&gt; Daniel was the master\nof useless trivia.\n\n454\n00:22:53.019 --> 00:22:54.002\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n455\n00:22:54.002 --> 00:22:54.919\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt that.\n\n456\n00:22:54.919 --> 00:23:01.070\nBut we often go off on our unscheduled\nlittle divergences in our discussions.\n\n457\n00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:03.805\nBut, we talk a lot about movies\nwhile we're doing our shows, and\n\n458\n00:23:03.805 --> 00:23:06.693\nwe bring them in and really incorporate\nthem into the conversation,\n\n459\n00:23:06.693 --> 00:23:09.265\nsometimes with more benefit than others,\nI will grant you.\n\n460\n00:23:09.265 --> 00:23:11.099\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But, you know,\n\n461\n00:23:11.099 --> 00:23:13.382\nif you have seen A Few Good Men.\n\n462\n00:23:13.382 --> 00:23:15.388\nI don't know if that's\na movie you have seen or not.\n\n463\n00:23:15.388 --> 00:23:17.523\nBut, if you've seen it, Tom Cruise.\n\n464\n00:23:17.523 --> 00:23:19.338\n&gt;&gt; A war movie?\n\n465\n00:23:19.338 --> 00:23:20.417\n&gt;&gt; Not really, no.\n\n466\n00:23:20.417 --> 00:23:21.843\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna go with no.\n\n467\n00:23:21.843 --> 00:23:23.325\n&gt;&gt; He's like scratch that, Cherokee.\n\n468\n00:23:23.325 --> 00:23:24.860\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee has not seen that.\n\n469\n00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:29.355\nSo we're just gonna continue on as if\nwe didn't have that last 30 second\n\n470\n00:23:29.355 --> 00:23:34.880\nexploration into movies that Cherokee has\nnot seen because yeah, no, not even close.\n\n471\n00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:38.635\nThey do wear military uniforms so\nit's kind of in the genre but\n\n472\n00:23:38.635 --> 00:23:42.694\nit's the extreme left hand corner and\nwe're at the opposite end.\n\n473\n00:23:42.694 --> 00:23:46.532\nThe reason I was just mentioning is that\nthe premise of the movie if you have not\n\n474\n00:23:46.532 --> 00:23:49.145\nseen it,\nis it centers around an event that occurs.\n\n475\n00:23:49.145 --> 00:23:52.474\nAnd then the trial that comes out of\nthat event with regards to the military,\n\n476\n00:23:52.474 --> 00:23:54.932\nit's a military tribunal,\nand the trial that goes on.\n\n477\n00:23:54.932 --> 00:23:58.980\nBut at one point in the trial.\n\n478\n00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:02.260\nYou got Tom Cruise, who is one of the key\nlawyers, Demi Moore is on his team.\n\n479\n00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:03.650\n&gt;&gt; It's coming back to me.\n\n480\n00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:04.560\n&gt;&gt; You've got Kevin Bacon,\n\n481\n00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:08.000\nwho's the lawyer on the other side, who's\nthe prosecutor for the government, right?\n\n482\n00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.100\nYou've got this whole dynamic,\nJack Nicholson plays the head\n\n483\n00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:15.300\nof Guantanamo Bay,\nthe Army base that's involved in this.\n\n484\n00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:16.790\nReally good movie if you haven't seen it.\n\n485\n00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:19.215\nBut at a certain point they're going\nback and forth about all this, and\n\n486\n00:24:19.215 --> 00:24:21.049\nthey're talking about all\nthese different things.\n\n487\n00:24:21.049 --> 00:24:25.292\nAnd at a certain point of the movie,\nthey talk about the fact that\n\n488\n00:24:25.292 --> 00:24:29.773\nwhen Jack Nicholson makes his declaration,\ngoing to say he did it,\n\n489\n00:24:29.773 --> 00:24:34.200\nhe called for the Code Red,\nwhich was the whole crux of this thing.\n\n490\n00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:38.453\nAnd at that point Kevin Bacon stands\nup and says, actually Tom Cruise says,\n\n491\n00:24:38.453 --> 00:24:43.104\nthe witness has rights, right, definitely\nstop what where doing in a proceedings\n\n492\n00:24:43.104 --> 00:24:46.440\nthe witness has rights we\nmoved to Article 4 whatever.\n\n493\n00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:50.460\nHe says we have to try this witness\nunder a different set of standards and\n\n494\n00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:54.460\nwe have to protect this witness's rights\nbecause now the witness is accused of\n\n495\n00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:57.020\na crime and\nwe have to treat him differently and\n\n496\n00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:59.970\nat that critical moment in\nthe dialog of the movie.\n\n497\n00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:03.620\nIt's important to acknowledge this and\nunderstand this because we can't just\n\n498\n00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:07.450\nassume that the government come and such\nwhenever they want for whatever reason\n\n499\n00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:11.040\nbecause that we would have no way of\nguaranteeing our privacy as individual.\n\n500\n00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.172\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And so we have to think about the fact\n\n501\n00:25:13.172 --> 00:25:17.533\nthat a such must be constitutional,\nmust follow the laws and the guidance that\n\n502\n00:25:17.533 --> 00:25:21.763\nthe Constitution lays down, and is\ninterpreted by the Supreme Court in this\n\n503\n00:25:21.763 --> 00:25:26.423\ncountry, or whatever court may be at that\napex, at that level in another country.\n\n504\n00:25:26.423 --> 00:25:30.781\nAnd so a search is deemed constitutional,\nin the United States, if it does not\n\n505\n00:25:30.781 --> 00:25:35.143\nviolate a person's reasonable or\nlegitimate expectation of privacy based on\n\n506\n00:25:35.143 --> 00:25:39.321\na very famous case, Katz v the United\nStates which took place in 1967.\n\n507\n00:25:39.321 --> 00:25:42.117\nYou can see some information\nabout it on the show notes but\n\n508\n00:25:42.117 --> 00:25:43.950\nthis case was a seminal case.\n\n509\n00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:48.500\nIt really laid down this idea that\nsearches are going to be constitutional\n\n510\n00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:52.070\nif they don't violate reasonable and\nlegitimate expectation to privacy.\n\n511\n00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:56.300\nBut we have to understand how we\nestablish what that reasonable and\n\n512\n00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:59.490\nexpected declaration of privacy may be.\n\n513\n00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:01.200\n&gt;&gt; It's a very touchy situation, Adam, and\n\n514\n00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.960\nI was actually just gonna ask you\nabout that because James Whitaker,\n\n515\n00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.570\na Microsoft evangelist,\nI really like the way he explains privacy.\n\n516\n00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:10.260\nBecause that Christmas song,\n\n517\n00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:13.340\nhe sees you when you're sleeping,\nhe knows when you're awake.\n\n518\n00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:17.470\nA lot of people don't see\nSanta Claus as this evil entity but\n\n519\n00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:19.680\nif some people might feel\nthat way about the NSA.\n\n520\n00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:22.930\nAnd if we have a sliding scale\nwith Santa at one end and\n\n521\n00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:27.380\nthen some agency at the other, where\ndoes that reasonable expectation fall?\n\n522\n00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:35.080\n&gt;&gt; So when we think, and I'm not gonna use\nthe Santa Claus NSA evil analogy scale.\n\n523\n00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:38.460\nThat's a little bit beyond me,\nnumber one because I'm Jewish, and\n\n524\n00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:41.210\nwe don't do Santa Claus but aside from\nthat, it can be the Hanukkah thing.\n\n525\n00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:43.900\nBut aside from that, I don't think\nSanta Claus is good or bad and\n\n526\n00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:46.900\nI certainly don't think the NSA is good or\nbad, I just think that they are.\n\n527\n00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:48.390\nSo I get what you're saying though.\n\n528\n00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:51.720\nLet's talk about it, perhaps get out\nof that frame reference for a minute.\n\n529\n00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Let's make it a little bit more\n\n530\n00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:56.130\nfocused around corporate entities and\nhow we deal with them.\n\n531\n00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:59.620\nYeah, the idea that Cherokee's throwing\nout and the question is really important,\n\n532\n00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:01.310\nbut let's frame with regards\nto what we're talking about,\n\n533\n00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:04.790\nwith regards to incident handling within\nthe organization, within the enterprise.\n\n534\n00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:09.320\nAnd I think the way to talk about it is\nreally how do we set the expectation and\n\n535\n00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:12.960\nhow do we declare that expectation\nequally for everybody, right,\n\n536\n00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:13.960\nwithin the organization?\n\n537\n00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.930\nAnd this goes back to what we talked\nabout earlier with regards to policy.\n\n538\n00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:19.630\nRight, when we say we have a policy for\nthis and\n\n539\n00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:22.980\nwe expect you,\nas you said when we began the episode.\n\n540\n00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:26.980\nI would communicate this probably to\neverybody I would, you're from a HR\n\n541\n00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:30.050\nperspective or something like that is\nthere number I meet with them and make\n\n542\n00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:33.851\nsure they understand and give them not to\nask questions I have them sign off on it.\n\n543\n00:27:33.851 --> 00:27:36.700\nRight, and then I would have proof\nthat they understand that I've\n\n544\n00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:37.550\ncommunicated that.\n\n545\n00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:42.890\nSo it's about that expectation setting and\nthis has to happen through policy.\n\n546\n00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:48.340\nIf you don't set and declare what\nthe reasonable expectations for\n\n547\n00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:51.250\nengagement are,\nthen it's open to interpretation.\n\n548\n00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:54.420\nThen we do have a problem, then we do\nhave the, hey maybe the NSA is bad and\n\n549\n00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:58.950\nSanta Claus is good, or maybe the NSA is\ngood and Santa Claus is bad conversation.\n\n550\n00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:01.650\nCuz it's hard to say, we just don't know.\n\n551\n00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:04.080\nAnd so this is one of those\nthings we have to think about.\n\n552\n00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:08.210\nBut when we think about the fact\nthat if we enshrine in theory,\n\n553\n00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:12.565\nin policy unequivocally, standardized\ncommunicated broadband widely.\n\n554\n00:28:12.565 --> 00:28:16.165\nAudited and applied equally to\neverybody in the organization\n\n555\n00:28:16.165 --> 00:28:20.455\nthat this is our standard,\nthis is our approach, this is what we say.\n\n556\n00:28:20.455 --> 00:28:23.725\nThen there should be no, I think you even\nsaid it when we were talking before.\n\n557\n00:28:23.725 --> 00:28:24.765\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; There is no wiggle room, right?\n\n558\n00:28:24.765 --> 00:28:25.715\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I mean that's what,\n\n559\n00:28:25.715 --> 00:28:27.825\nessentially you used to describe it.\n\n560\n00:28:27.825 --> 00:28:29.735\nI like that, I think that's\na great way of thinking about it.\n\n561\n00:28:29.735 --> 00:28:31.685\nBecause it's so tightly defined and\n\n562\n00:28:31.685 --> 00:28:34.920\nboxed in, that we can't really\ninterpret it any other way.\n\n563\n00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.670\nAnd this is what's critical about this,\n\n564\n00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:40.850\nit's the idea that everybody understands\nthat there is an expectation of policy.\n\n565\n00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:46.378\nThere is an expectation of policy,\nthere is an expectation of privacy but\n\n566\n00:28:46.378 --> 00:28:49.462\nthat expectation of privacy may not apply\nthe same way in the business as it does\n\n567\n00:28:49.462 --> 00:28:49.995\nin the home.\n\n568\n00:28:49.995 --> 00:28:52.680\nAnd if you're gonna communicate\nabout a personal and\n\n569\n00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:55.963\npersonally identifiable information\non a corporate owned asset\n\n570\n00:28:55.963 --> 00:28:59.501\nthat maybe subject to other people\nseeing it and interacting with it.\n\n571\n00:28:59.501 --> 00:29:02.784\nAnd as a result you may wanna go outside\non your cell phone in the parking\n\n572\n00:29:02.784 --> 00:29:06.347\nlot in your car, and make that phone\ncall so that people aren't listening,\n\n573\n00:29:06.347 --> 00:29:09.440\nand they don't have a sense\nof what you're talking about.\n\n574\n00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:13.510\nVersus picking up the phone at your desk\nand talking to, I don't know, your doctor,\n\n575\n00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:14.980\nyour spouse, your child,\n\n576\n00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:18.970\nwhatever it may be, about something that's\njust really not for public consumption.\n\n577\n00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:21.470\nSo whatever that may be,\nwe have to follow those rules.\n\n578\n00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:23.590\nNow, woe to the business, right?\n\n579\n00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:29.020\nWoe to the organization, woe to\nthe security professional that does not,\n\n580\n00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:31.860\nhas not, set this up and broadly and\n\n581\n00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:34.560\nwidely communicated these standards\nto everybody around them.\n\n582\n00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:37.730\nYou mentioned in one of our prior\nepisodes, what if, as a scenario,\n\n583\n00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:39.690\nwhat if a small mom and pop had an issue?\n\n584\n00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:41.440\nHow would we respond forensically,\n\n585\n00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.300\nwould they be able to follow these\nguidelines that we were talking about?\n\n586\n00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.330\nIt's a great frame of reference for this.\n\n587\n00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:49.471\nYour smaller businesses\nmay not understand and\n\n588\n00:29:49.471 --> 00:29:52.930\nactually have this same\nkind of thought process.\n\n589\n00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:54.290\nCuz maybe nobody sat them down and\n\n590\n00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:57.700\nsaid hey, this is an issue,\nhow are you gonna deal with this?\n\n591\n00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:59.760\nDoes everybody understand this?\n\n592\n00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:04.450\nAnd as a result, when we start out\nfrom that very small kind of mom and\n\n593\n00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:08.230\npop business entrepreneurially and\nwe grow especially for grow quickly and\n\n594\n00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:13.450\nwe become a large organization,\nsometimes we miss these key milestones.\n\n595\n00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:16.580\nThese key check points about\nenshrining these kind of things and\n\n596\n00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:20.660\nif we don't have a declarative policy it\ncan be problematic later because people\n\n597\n00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:24.630\nthen may come back and say well I didn't\nknow I didn't understand, I wasn't aware.\n\n598\n00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:27.040\nOr I've been here so\nlong nobody told me that, right?\n\n599\n00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.910\nI started out 20 years ago,\nwe didn't have that policy.\n\n600\n00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:32.540\nAnd so I just operate on the assumption\nit's still that way when indeed\n\n601\n00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:33.070\nit might not be.\n\n602\n00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:36.910\nAnd so these are things that we would\nneed to think about and consider, right?\n\n603\n00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:40.670\nAccording to the Supreme Court, it's\na great way to start a conversation if you\n\n604\n00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:44.100\nunderstand what the Supreme Court said and\nas a result what the impact is.\n\n605\n00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:47.530\nBut you may not have a point of reference\nas a baseline and then that may or\n\n606\n00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:49.400\nmay not be meaningful in the organization,\nright?\n\n607\n00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:53.210\nWarrantless searches, according to\nthe Supreme Court, do not violate the 4th\n\n608\n00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:57.520\nAmendment if we are operating under one or\ntwo different conditions.\n\n609\n00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:59.670\nLet's just quickly talk about\nwhat those are circling back\n\n610\n00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:01.340\nto some of the conversation\nwe were just having.\n\n611\n00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:04.960\nClearly two conditions you've got to be\naware of here, first, the government's\n\n612\n00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:09.360\nconduct doesn't violate the reasonable\nexpectation of privacy as we were saying.\n\n613\n00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:14.230\nThen, it's not a 4th Amendment search,\nand no warrant is required.\n\n614\n00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:18.311\nIn other words, if we don't violate\nthe person's expectation of privacy, then\n\n615\n00:31:18.311 --> 00:31:22.645\nwe're not violating the 4th Amendment, and\nas a result it's not gonna be a problem.\n\n616\n00:31:22.645 --> 00:31:27.194\nSo when a police officer stops you\ndriving down the road, right, and\n\n617\n00:31:27.194 --> 00:31:32.450\npulls you over and says, hey, you were\ngoing too fast in this particular area or\n\n618\n00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:36.620\nyou seem to be driving erratically or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n619\n00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:40.075\nIf they feel that they have observed\nsomething legitimately, right,\n\n620\n00:31:40.075 --> 00:31:42.370\nthen they have reason to pull you over.\n\n621\n00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:45.880\nAnd they may have justifiable cause,\nthat's what we would call it.\n\n622\n00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:47.655\nThey have observed activity and\n\n623\n00:31:47.655 --> 00:31:51.736\nbehavior that indicates that you may\nbe something that violates the law.\n\n624\n00:31:51.736 --> 00:31:55.596\nAnd they may not need a warrant to\nsearch your car if they pull you over\n\n625\n00:31:55.596 --> 00:31:59.998\nin that justifiable cause or reason to be\nable to then get you out of that car and\n\n626\n00:31:59.998 --> 00:32:01.857\nyou're acting suspiciously.\n\n627\n00:32:01.857 --> 00:32:04.891\nAnd they may then at that point be able\nto search your car without a warrant.\n\n628\n00:32:04.891 --> 00:32:08.086\nSo there are reasons why warrantless\nsearches are perfectly legal and\n\n629\n00:32:08.086 --> 00:32:11.380\nlegitimate, but there are reasons and\ntimes where the may not be.\n\n630\n00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:12.240\nWe have to be aware of that.\n\n631\n00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:16.242\nThe second criteria, warrantless searches\nthat violate a person's reasonable\n\n632\n00:32:16.242 --> 00:32:19.322\nexpectations to privacy can\nstill be considered reasonable.\n\n633\n00:32:19.322 --> 00:32:24.298\nAnd as a result, constitutional, if it\nfalls within an established exception to\n\n634\n00:32:24.298 --> 00:32:28.121\nthe warrant requirement,\nmeaning there are stipulations and\n\n635\n00:32:28.121 --> 00:32:32.898\nactivities that fall into a category,\nexigent circumstance is one, right.\n\n636\n00:32:32.898 --> 00:32:37.335\nWhere we could search without a warrant\neven though under normal circumstances\n\n637\n00:32:37.335 --> 00:32:40.180\nthis would be considered a violation.\n\n638\n00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:43.690\nContextually the circumstances are such\nthat we can put that aside and\n\n639\n00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:45.470\nwe can search without a warrant.\n\n640\n00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:50.450\nFear of somebody being harmed so\nimmediate harm or threat or\n\n641\n00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:53.110\nloss of life being\npotentially the outcome.\n\n642\n00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:54.480\nSomebody's been kidnapped.\n\n643\n00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:55.530\nWe don't know where they are.\n\n644\n00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:59.560\nWe have reason to believe that they\nare being held in the trunk of that car.\n\n645\n00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:00.690\nWe pull the car over.\n\n646\n00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:04.798\nWe don't have a warrant, we have\nthe ability as law enforcement officers,\n\n647\n00:33:04.798 --> 00:33:09.033\nyou do not myself but a law enforcement\nofficer would have the ability to be able\n\n648\n00:33:09.033 --> 00:33:11.234\nto ask the driver to open that car trunk.\n\n649\n00:33:11.234 --> 00:33:13.680\nAnd if they refuse to open\nit anyway without a warrant,\n\n650\n00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:17.083\nbecause of the fact that they fear that\nthere may be a human in the trunk that is\n\n651\n00:33:17.083 --> 00:33:18.930\nbeing held against their will.\n\n652\n00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:22.540\nThat would be something that would\nbe an exception to this clause.\n\n653\n00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:23.830\nSo there are reasons why,\n\n654\n00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:27.620\neven without a warrant under normal\ncircumstances, we could still search.\n\n655\n00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:29.505\nI consider that search\nto be constitutional.\n\n656\n00:33:29.505 --> 00:33:33.861\nBut it's a grey area and let me be clear\nwhen I say grey area cuz I don't mean what\n\n657\n00:33:33.861 --> 00:33:37.100\nyou think I mean,\nit's a grey area in one respect.\n\n658\n00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:41.924\nWe're relying on the first responder,\ntypically a law enforcement professional,\n\n659\n00:33:41.924 --> 00:33:45.676\nwhose been trained,\nwho understands what these parameters are,\n\n660\n00:33:45.676 --> 00:33:48.094\nto make this judgement call in many cases.\n\n661\n00:33:48.094 --> 00:33:53.622\nThis is not given our conversation, this\nis not Cherokee or I's incident responders\n\n662\n00:33:53.622 --> 00:33:58.880\nto a computer crisis, deciding whether\nit's okay to log on to that machine.\n\n663\n00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:00.250\nThis is much broader, much bigger,\n\n664\n00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:02.640\nmuch more impactful that\nwe're talking about here.\n\n665\n00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:06.735\nThis is a Is about typically life safety,\nright, issues more often than not.\n\n666\n00:34:06.735 --> 00:34:10.361\nBut we can bring that back and dial it\nback around to the idea of incident\n\n667\n00:34:10.361 --> 00:34:13.441\nresponse where we may need to\nget on to someone's machine.\n\n668\n00:34:13.441 --> 00:34:17.187\nOr you'll be able to go into their\noffice and search their drawers and\n\n669\n00:34:17.187 --> 00:34:21.940\nthings like that in the desk and search\ntheir computer inside the organization.\n\n670\n00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:25.502\nThe reasonable expectation of privacy\nissues still have to be addressed but\n\n671\n00:34:25.502 --> 00:34:28.839\nthey may not be addressed from the same\nperspective with regards to life\n\n672\n00:34:28.839 --> 00:34:30.246\nsafety and things like that.\n\n673\n00:34:30.246 --> 00:34:31.410\nSo I want to make that distinction.\n\n674\n00:34:31.410 --> 00:34:34.614\n&gt;&gt; Plus you noted all of those\nadditional parameters in the show notes,\n\n675\n00:34:34.614 --> 00:34:37.280\nthat people really wanted to dive down and\nlook at those.\n\n676\n00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.021\n&gt;&gt; We did, absolutely.\n\n677\n00:34:38.021 --> 00:34:39.090\nOr at least we tried to anyway, right?\n\n678\n00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:40.060\nWe can't always get.\n\n679\n00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:43.319\nHopefully we get a lot, but you know,\nlook, there's a lot more to this.\n\n680\n00:34:43.319 --> 00:34:46.970\nAs we said, I wish this could be\na discussion about constitutional law, and\n\n681\n00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:49.664\nwe could spend hours going\nthrough the mechanics of it.\n\n682\n00:34:49.664 --> 00:34:52.230\nBut it's beyond, obviously,\nour ability to do that.\n\n683\n00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:54.780\nWe're trying to give you a broad\ninterpretation, as we said.\n\n684\n00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:56.329\nWe've provided some additional detail,\n\n685\n00:34:56.329 --> 00:34:58.143\nas Cherokee rightly points\nout in the show notes.\n\n686\n00:34:58.143 --> 00:35:00.050\nI encourage you to take a look at that.\n\n687\n00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:03.355\nWe do have a little part two, I think,\nwe're gonna engage in around this.\n\n688\n00:35:03.355 --> 00:35:04.444\nAnd we'll come back and\n\n689\n00:35:04.444 --> 00:35:07.500\ntalk about something known as\nthe Privacy Protection Act.\n\n690\n00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:10.460\nAnother interesting little aside that\nwe wanna make sure we give a little\n\n691\n00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:12.950\ncoverage to,\nbefore we wrap up our conversations fully.\n\n692\n00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:13.490\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great.\n\n693\n00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:14.140\nYou heard Adam.\n\n694\n00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:15.990\nLet's go ahead and just get comfortable.\n\n695\n00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:19.480\nStay put, grab some popcorn, because\nwe have a part two headed your way.\n\n696\n00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.114\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this show.\n\n697\n00:35:21.114 --> 00:35:22.611\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n698\n00:35:22.611 -->

00:00:08.177\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.177 --> 00:00:11.858\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.858 --> 00:00:16.378\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your ECIH series,\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.378 --> 00:00:20.031\nNow if you've been following along, you'll\nknow this is actually a part two where we\n\n7\n00:00:20.031 --> 00:00:22.940\nwere previously looking at security and\nlaw with Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.210\nSo thank you for coming back, Adam,\nnot leaving us hanging there.\n\n9\n00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.800\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, I mean,\nI really don't have a choice.\n\n10\n00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.600\nI'm tethered to the desk,\nI can't go anywhere.\n\n11\n00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.040\nThey've got a shackle on my leg here,\nso I'm not actually able to run away.\n\n12\n00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.100\nSo but I am glad to be back nonetheless,\nright?\n\n13\n00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.370\nAlways be gracious and\n\n14\n00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.880\naccept an invitation when offered\nis what my mother taught me.\n\n15\n00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.520\nSo I am happy to be here,\nhappy to be here with all of you.\n\n16\n00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.380\nAnd of course,\nalways happy to be here with Cherokee.\n\n17\n00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.480\nSo we wanna continue our conversations\na little bit about incident response,\n\n18\n00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.020\nsecurity policy and law, and\nframing that conversation.\n\n19\n00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.490\nWe had a really interesting\npart one conversation.\n\n20\n00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.040\nOne of those times where if you\nhave not seen that episode,\n\n21\n00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.010\ngotta encourage you\njust as we get started.\n\n22\n00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.112\nThink about watching that first only cuz\nit's gonna lay out the framework we're\n\n23\n00:01:02.112 --> 00:01:02.761\ntalking about.\n\n24\n00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:06.296\nAnd you're not gonna be jumping into\nthis conversation literally midstream\n\n25\n00:01:06.296 --> 00:01:09.680\nwithout a point of reference for\nall the stuff we've been talking about.\n\n26\n00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.660\nSo it would be a good idea for\nyou to go back, just watch that one first.\n\n27\n00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.480\nThat's why we label them part one and\nthen part two.\n\n28\n00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.880\nThat way it's easy to know which\none to go and take a look at.\n\n29\n00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.030\nBut you should make sure\nyou see that first.\n\n30\n00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.420\nIf you don't get a chance to, no big deal.\n\n31\n00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.245\nWe'll certainly bring you up to speed here\nquickly with a high level review, but\n\n32\n00:01:25.245 --> 00:01:28.069\nthe specificity and\nthe detail is gonna be in that episode.\n\n33\n00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:31.540\nAnd you wanna bring that forward here\nas we continue our conversations.\n\n34\n00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.290\nWe were talking about the Fourth Amendment\nof the United States Constitution,\n\n35\n00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.810\nhow we deal with search and\nseizure, what is reasonable,\n\n36\n00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.120\nwhat is an expectation of privacy.\n\n37\n00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.030\nHow do incident responders\naddress those concerns?\n\n38\n00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.550\nCan we deal with warrantless searches?\n\n39\n00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.610\nIf so, how?\n\n40\n00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.140\nIs there something called exigent\ncircumstance that allows us to\n\n41\n00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.210\naddress this?\n\n42\n00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.340\nThese are things that we had\ntalked about in the last episode.\n\n43\n00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.227\nAnd there is some specificity and detail\nin the show notes, but from that show and\n\n44\n00:01:57.227 --> 00:02:00.673\nthere will be from this one as well,\nI wanna remind you about that also.\n\n45\n00:02:00.673 --> 00:02:02.584\nI always encourage you\nto take a look at those,\n\n46\n00:02:02.584 --> 00:02:05.410\nmake sure you gather all that\nadditional detail as needed.\n\n47\n00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.480\nSo we were talking about the need\nto understand the requirements and\n\n48\n00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.820\nthe boundaries of privacy, what they are,\n\n49\n00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.740\nhow we address the ability to\nbe able to search reasonably.\n\n50\n00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.930\nAnd what a thought process around privacy\nand the communication of boundaries for\n\n51\n00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.430\nprivacy, what we call\nexpectation of privacy would be.\n\n52\n00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.770\nThe Fourth Amendment, as I've said in the\nprior episode and I'll say it again here,\n\n53\n00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.160\nfor those of you that are just\njoining us brand new,\n\n54\n00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.580\nwe're looking at this from the United\nStates law perspective right now.\n\n55\n00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.658\nWe need to broaden this conversation\nout to anywhere in the world that's\n\n56\n00:02:34.658 --> 00:02:37.741\nan incident handler, incident responders,\nsecurity professional.\n\n57\n00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:40.045\nIf you are localized to a certain country,\n\n58\n00:02:40.045 --> 00:02:44.020\nmake sure you understand the legalities\nand the laws in play there.\n\n59\n00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.720\nThat's the first primary prima facie, most\nimportant responsibility you have in this\n\n60\n00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.520\nindustry doing this job is to understand\nhow to localize this knowledge and\n\n61\n00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.090\napply the applicable\nframeworks to whatever we do.\n\n62\n00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.560\nWe are simply the point of reference\nhere that is available to us and\n\n63\n00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.150\nthat we can discuss,\nnot because everybody understands it.\n\n64\n00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.600\nI know that there are many,\nmany people that may watch us,\n\n65\n00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.670\nthat don’t live in the United States, may\nnot be bound by the laws of this country,\n\n66\n00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.580\nand may see this conversation as\nbeing perhaps of interest or not.\n\n67\n00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.090\nBut not really specifically gonna\nhelp them and really align with them\n\n68\n00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.310\nin their country, and\nI do understand that, we understand that.\n\n69\n00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.880\nAs I said in the last show,\nit would be impossible for us,\n\n70\n00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.310\ngiven the constraints of time and\nour abilities,\n\n71\n00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.620\nto be able to give as much coverage and\nas thorough a detailed coverage and\n\n72\n00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.100\ndiscussion as we would need to,\nto do just to every country's laws.\n\n73\n00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.262\nWe leave that up to you and\n\n74\n00:03:36.262 --> 00:03:40.370\nthe real world's professionals to figure\nthat out as part of what you do every day.\n\n75\n00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.953\nBut the Fourth Amendment is something\nthat we do wanna just think about,\n\n76\n00:03:43.953 --> 00:03:47.418\nand again, just a quick quote from it,\nFourth Amendment is wholly and\n\n77\n00:03:47.418 --> 00:03:50.492\napplicable, not from it, but\njust around it, I should say.\n\n78\n00:03:50.492 --> 00:03:53.951\nFourth Amendment is wholly and\napplicable to search and seizure of even\n\n79\n00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:57.812\nan unreasonable one, affected by a private\nindividual not acting as an agent of\n\n80\n00:03:57.812 --> 00:04:02.080\nthe government or with participation or\nknowledge of any government official.\n\n81\n00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.243\nIn other words, as a result, no violation\nof the Fourth Amendment occurs when\n\n82\n00:04:06.243 --> 00:04:09.966\na private individual acting of their\nown accord engages in a search and\n\n83\n00:04:09.966 --> 00:04:14.022\nthen makes those results available to\na law enforcement agency or officer.\n\n84\n00:04:14.022 --> 00:04:17.968\nBecause you're not acting as an extension\nof the law enforcement function, but\n\n85\n00:04:17.968 --> 00:04:20.300\nrather on your own as a private citizen.\n\n86\n00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.380\nAnd so I had this conversation\nwith Cherokee in between shows\n\n87\n00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.580\nwhere we were suggesting that if you were\na representative of the law enforcement\n\n88\n00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.280\nagency or entity.\n\n89\n00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.610\nAnd you engaged in\na warrantless search and\n\n90\n00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.510\ndid not have exigent circumstance\nto validate that you could do so.\n\n91\n00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.230\nYou would probably be found to be in\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment.\n\n92\n00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.410\nBut as a private citizen,\nif I go out and execute a search and\n\n93\n00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.990\nthen I find something unusual.\n\n94\n00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.700\nOr for whatever reason, something\nthat may be indicative of illicit or\n\n95\n00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.780\nillegal behavior.\n\n96\n00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.260\nAnd I report that to law enforcement\nofficials, they're then able to come and\n\n97\n00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.790\nact on that, even though there was a\nsearch that took place without a warrant,\n\n98\n00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.340\nbecause I was not acting as\na law enforcement official.\n\n99\n00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.890\nI acted as a private individual,\na private citizen.\n\n100\n00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.320\nThis is seen as being acceptable\nin the eyes of the law.\n\n101\n00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.860\nAnd this is important because this gives\nus as incident handlers the ability to be\n\n102\n00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.880\nable to engage in activities that\ndrive response, and as a result,\n\n103\n00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.620\nmay engage us in activities that may\nuncover illicit illegal behavior.\n\n104\n00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.390\nEvidence of the crime,\nas you were asking about and\n\n105\n00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:23.910\nwe were talking about a little bit before.\n\n106\n00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.062\nWhat if I found this or\nthat, what would I do?\n\n107\n00:05:26.062 --> 00:05:27.440\nHow would I respond?\n\n108\n00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.290\nWell, when that happens,\nwe have the right, we have the ability,\n\n109\n00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.360\nwe have the responsibility to report that.\n\n110\n00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.800\nBut we can do so\nnot fearing that we have broken any law,\n\n111\n00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.530\nnot fearing that the law enforcement\nofficial that we give this information to\n\n112\n00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.110\nwill not be able to act upon it, assuming,\nof course, if we did not break a law.\n\n113\n00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.710\nWe didn't break in and commit a crime,\nget into somebody's house, kick down their\n\n114\n00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.300\ndoor, hold them at gun point to find that\ninformation, totally unacceptable, right?\n\n115\n00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.908\nWe can't do that.\n\n116\n00:05:53.908 --> 00:05:58.322\nBut assuming that during the course of\nincident response, in an office, following\n\n117\n00:05:58.322 --> 00:06:02.751\nproper procedure and policy, we search\nsomeone's desk, we find a locked drawer.\n\n118\n00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:05.198\nWe have the security team or\nwhoever open that up,\n\n119\n00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:09.047\nwe find evidence of malfeasance and\nwrongdoing, that can be presented to a law\n\n120\n00:06:09.047 --> 00:06:12.924\nenforcement official without a warrant\nhaving been issued to do that search.\n\n121\n00:06:12.924 --> 00:06:16.170\nCuz we have the rights because\nit is on the premises to do so.\n\n122\n00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.595\n&gt;&gt; Well, Adam, [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Just wanna understand that.\n\n123\n00:06:17.595 --> 00:06:20.516\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in my experience working in IT,\nsometimes you do come\n\n124\n00:06:20.516 --> 00:06:24.321\nacross information that really wasn't\ndesigned for your viewing purposes.\n\n125\n00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:27.734\nBut you just kind of come across it\nwhenever you're doing your normal day to\n\n126\n00:06:27.734 --> 00:06:28.940\nday functions, so.\n\n127\n00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.450\n&gt;&gt; Sure, probably all the time,\nI would think.\n\n128\n00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:34.569\nI mean, just if you have administrative\nrights or some sort of extra user rights,\n\n129\n00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:39.047\nsuper user rights, where you're operating\nat different levels in the system, you're\n\n130\n00:06:39.047 --> 00:06:43.330\nvery likely to find all sorts of stuff\non a regular basis, no doubt about it.\n\n131\n00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.215\nWe have another case we just wanna throw\nout for you here, we talked about Katz\n\n132\n00:06:46.215 --> 00:06:49.906\nversus US before in the prior episode,\nencourage you to take a look at that.\n\n133\n00:06:49.906 --> 00:06:54.080\nUS versus Jacobson from 1984\nis a Supreme Court case,\n\n134\n00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.100\nanother really important\nseminal case here.\n\n135\n00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.980\nPresents the framework ultimately\nthat is used to guide agents\n\n136\n00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.830\nseeking to uncover evidence as\na result of private searches.\n\n137\n00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.188\nThat's what we would call them.\n\n138\n00:07:03.188 --> 00:07:07.200\nAccording to Jacobson, the case, right,\nagents who learn of evidence by a private\n\n139\n00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.340\nsearch can then go back and reenact that\nsearch without the original private search\n\n140\n00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.360\nviolating any reasonable\nexpectation of privacy.\n\n141\n00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.670\nIn other words, an agent here would\nbe a law enforcement official, right?\n\n142\n00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:22.630\nSo, if a private citizen finds something,\ngives it to law enforcement,\n\n143\n00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:26.630\nthey can then go back and retrace those\nsteps and reenact that without a warrant.\n\n144\n00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:30.470\nBecause they are operating on information\nthey got from a search that was\n\n145\n00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.930\nwarrantless, but was considered legal\nunder the guise of how it happened.\n\n146\n00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:39.140\nWhat the agents cannot do without a\nwarrant is exceed, according to Jacobson,\n\n147\n00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.240\nexceed the scope of the private search.\n\n148\n00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:45.611\nMeaning they could come back and retrace\nthe steps that the individual engaged in,\n\n149\n00:07:45.611 --> 00:07:47.932\nthat found the evidence\nin the first place.\n\n150\n00:07:47.932 --> 00:07:51.822\nBut if they go beyond the narrowly\ndefined scope of that initial search,\n\n151\n00:07:51.822 --> 00:07:53.490\nthey must have a warrant do so.\n\n152\n00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:57.151\nSo the court has held that there\nstill is an expectation of privacy,\n\n153\n00:07:57.151 --> 00:08:01.518\nthere still is protection, but We may be\nable to operate within a very narrowly,\n\n154\n00:08:01.518 --> 00:08:05.246\ncarved out, defined area,\nthat a third-party has validated, and\n\n155\n00:08:05.246 --> 00:08:08.600\nbrought to the attention of\nlaw enforcement officials.\n\n156\n00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.490\nAs long as we don't go beyond the scope\nof that area without a warrant.\n\n157\n00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.559\nThis is often why you see this in movies,\nsee this in TV shows,\n\n158\n00:08:14.559 --> 00:08:16.105\nsee this in real life, right?\n\n159\n00:08:16.105 --> 00:08:18.782\n&gt;&gt; Actually that reminded me\nthat Edward Snowden movie,\n\n160\n00:08:18.782 --> 00:08:21.990\nI don't even know what it's called\nthat just recently came out.\n\n161\n00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:25.481\nBut this is kind of playing\ninto that where he claims that,\n\n162\n00:08:25.481 --> 00:08:28.189\nand again I'm neutral\non the NSA as well but,\n\n163\n00:08:28.189 --> 00:08:32.845\nEdward Snowden claimed that they exceeded\nthat by going off onto tentacles.\n\n164\n00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:35.363\nSuch as if I were investigating you,\nand then I started\n\n165\n00:08:35.363 --> 00:08:39.170\ninvestigating your hairdresser, and\nyour dentist, and so forth, like that.\n\n166\n00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:42.420\nIs that what we're referencing here,\nor am I just off base?\n\n167\n00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:44.490\n&gt;&gt; I wouldn't have necessarily\ngone in that direction,\n\n168\n00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:46.110\nI was gonna make a more broader statement.\n\n169\n00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:49.280\nSo let me just go back to what I\nwas about to say here for a minute.\n\n170\n00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.990\nWe can discuss that aspect of it,\nbut let me make this point first.\n\n171\n00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.925\nSo this is why often times in T.V.\n\n172\n00:08:53.925 --> 00:08:58.552\nshows, and movies, and in real life,\nyou will see that police officers show up.\n\n173\n00:08:58.552 --> 00:09:02.947\nAnd they will not be able to search and do\nsomething until a warrant has been brought\n\n174\n00:09:02.947 --> 00:09:07.024\nto the premises, and is obtained because\nthey fear that they will violate or\n\n175\n00:09:07.024 --> 00:09:10.660\ngo beyond the initial scope of\nwhat was done without a warrant.\n\n176\n00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:14.000\nAnd then contaminate the evidence and\nnot be able to use it, and so often,\n\n177\n00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.150\nthey will step back and they will say, as\na result, hey we were waiting on a warrant\n\n178\n00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:21.760\nto be issued, or\nessentially the right to search.\n\n179\n00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.750\nBeing defined and declared by a judge, and\n\n180\n00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:27.530\nbeing ruled legal under\nthe information that's been provided.\n\n181\n00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:30.640\nThey're waiting on that permission,\nbecause they know the chances\n\n182\n00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.540\nthey're gonna go beyond the scope\non that initial search.\n\n183\n00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.121\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And as a result of that,\n\n184\n00:09:35.121 --> 00:09:37.080\nthey wanna be covered legally, so\n\n185\n00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.741\nthat they don't potentially\ndiscount evidence that is found.\n\n186\n00:09:40.741 --> 00:09:44.395\nAnd you see this a lot of these plots on\nTV shows, Law and Order, and all these\n\n187\n00:09:44.395 --> 00:09:48.620\nthings, where sometimes the police do\nthe search, they don't have the warrant.\n\n188\n00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.390\nThen the whole show's about the fact\nthey had to throw that evidence out,\n\n189\n00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:54.130\nthey had to find other evidence,\nsometimes they stop and wait for\n\n190\n00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:56.200\nthe warrant, you see this displayed\nall these different ways.\n\n191\n00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:01.270\nBut ultimately what we want to understand\nhere as incident responders, given\n\n192\n00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:05.760\nwhat we're talking about is, that private\ncitizens have the ability to execute and\n\n193\n00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.420\nengage in these activities,\nthat's how we operate.\n\n194\n00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:12.183\nBut we then have a responsibility to turn\nthat information over to law enforcement,\n\n195\n00:10:12.183 --> 00:10:15.524\nand allow them to come back in under\nthe guise of a broader legal framework.\n\n196\n00:10:15.524 --> 00:10:18.696\nPerhaps with a warrant and\nwith broader capabilities and\n\n197\n00:10:18.696 --> 00:10:21.537\nunderstanding of how to execute a search,\nand do so\n\n198\n00:10:21.537 --> 00:10:24.930\nwith the coverage of whatever\nthe applicable law may be.\n\n199\n00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:28.370\nNow you raise a really interesting point\nand question about this in the broader\n\n200\n00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:31.220\ncontext, or, well,\nit's a narrowly defined context, but\n\n201\n00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:34.150\nbroader with regards to\nsomething like the Snowden case.\n\n202\n00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:36.183\nAnd yeah,\nwithout getting into the politics.\n\n203\n00:10:36.183 --> 00:10:38.689\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And the specificity of what Mr.\n\n204\n00:10:38.689 --> 00:10:43.660\nSnowden did, whether he was wrong or\nright, how this all devolved, but\n\n205\n00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:48.976\nultimately what his activities really,\nand not just him, but many others.\n\n206\n00:10:48.976 --> 00:10:50.813\n&gt;&gt; Whistleblowers.\n&gt;&gt; That he has both come after and\n\n207\n00:10:50.813 --> 00:10:52.410\nbefore at this point in time.\n\n208\n00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:54.810\nHave really gone through, has not so\n\n209\n00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:59.700\nmuch been a conversation around is it\nethical, is it legal, is it moral?\n\n210\n00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:02.630\nThere are those elements, don't get me\nwrong, all three of those are part of this\n\n211\n00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:05.830\nconversation but it's not so\nmuch was it legal.\n\n212\n00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:10.575\nWhat many, and use the term generically,\nwhistle blowers,\n\n213\n00:11:10.575 --> 00:11:15.605\nhave fell into in this conversation,\nis more about the quandary of ethics, and\n\n214\n00:11:15.605 --> 00:11:19.540\nlaw, and whether it's moral and ethical in\nterms of the behavior they're observing.\n\n215\n00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:22.520\nAnd in many cases, perhaps illegal,\nI'm not discounting that at all.\n\n216\n00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:27.390\nBut it's a person making a specific\njudgment at a point in time based on their\n\n217\n00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:31.000\nframework of reference,\nas opposed to perhaps referencing\n\n218\n00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.740\nthe letter of the law and strictly looking\nat it from a legal interpretation.\n\n219\n00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:37.470\nThat what we wind up dealing\nwith in these areas, right?\n\n220\n00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:42.368\nSo it's a much murkier, much more\ndifficult conversation to have to create\n\n221\n00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:45.366\nthat understanding is\nall I'm pointing out.\n\n222\n00:11:45.366 --> 00:11:46.551\nIt's a very interesting one to have.\n\n223\n00:11:46.551 --> 00:11:48.017\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And it's one you should have, and\n\n224\n00:11:48.017 --> 00:11:51.190\nit's one you should discuss, and\nthere's nothing wrong with doing that.\n\n225\n00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:55.520\nBut in the context of what we're doing\nhere, it's a very murky example, because\n\n226\n00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:00.140\nit brings into play a lot of other stuff\nthat's not necessarily clearly defined.\n\n227\n00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:03.980\nAnd as a result, is beyond the scope\nof this conversation just about, hey,\n\n228\n00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:07.180\nwhy don't we search this this\nway with this extension?\n\n229\n00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.720\nWarrant bay searches this way for\nthese reasons, here's a court case,\n\n230\n00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.950\nhere's why we do it.\n\n231\n00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:16.438\nThere is a lot more to it right then\nperhaps what we're talking about here,\n\n232\n00:12:16.438 --> 00:12:21.720\nand so it's a TBDI item, coming soon\nto a discussion offline near you.\n\n233\n00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.680\nSo let's talk about the PPA, The Privacy\nProtection Act a little bit, this is\n\n234\n00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:30.860\nanother area of legislation that is\nimportant to us here In the United States,\n\n235\n00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:34.320\nit helps many of us and we benefit\nfrom the fourth amendment, all of us.\n\n236\n00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.190\nWe benefit from the Privacy Protection Act\nwhether we are necessarily aware of it or\n\n237\n00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:39.880\nnot on a regular basis.\n\n238\n00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.560\nLaw enforcement it says, according to the\nact, must take special steps when planning\n\n239\n00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:47.580\na search that agents Canadians\nare the elements, the frontline.\n\n240\n00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:50.260\nPeople that are gonna execute\nsearch on enforcement officers.\n\n241\n00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.760\nWhen we say agents in this\nlanguage we simply mean\n\n242\n00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.020\nthe representatives of\nthat long force agency.\n\n243\n00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:57.950\nThat agents are reasonably believe\nmay resolve them seizure of\n\n244\n00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:59.740\ncertain First Amendment material.\n\n245\n00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:03.980\nFederal law enforcement searches that\nimplicate are going to address this,\n\n246\n00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:10.020\nmust actually be pre approved by a deputy\nassistant attorney general, as a result of\n\n247\n00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:13.910\nthe potential that we may violate or come\nup against first amendment rights here.\n\n248\n00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:15.800\nSo if we are gonna search, and\n\n249\n00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:19.840\nknowing we think on the part of law\nenforcement official, perhaps seize and\n\n250\n00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.000\ncome up against issues associated\nwith first amendment rights.\n\n251\n00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.232\nWe have to actually go, if we know ahead\nof time and proactively think about it,\n\n252\n00:13:27.232 --> 00:13:30.328\nunder the Privacy Protection Act,\nsee clearance from and\n\n253\n00:13:30.328 --> 00:13:33.572\nauthorization from some sort\nof law enforcement official.\n\n254\n00:13:33.572 --> 00:13:35.361\nIn this case, an Attorney General, or\n\n255\n00:13:35.361 --> 00:13:39.163\nAssistant Attorney General in the criminal\ndivision signing off on a piece of paper\n\n256\n00:13:39.163 --> 00:13:43.280\nthat essentially says, yes, we approve and\nallow these activities to take place.\n\n257\n00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:47.248\nEven knowing that there may be a first\namendment issue, we will deal with that,\n\n258\n00:13:47.248 --> 00:13:49.690\nand potentially negotiate\nthat after the fact.\n\n259\n00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:53.200\nBut we are aware of it ahead of time and\nwe're giving approval for\n\n260\n00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:57.295\nyou to go forward, so this is important\nbecause certain search activities\n\n261\n00:13:57.295 --> 00:14:01.060\nare gonna directly bear on and\nplay into first amendment rights.\n\n262\n00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:04.770\nWhen I search a computer, and I look at\na document that somebody has created or\n\n263\n00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:09.280\nwritten, that is a first amendment\nrelated concern, it's the product and\n\n264\n00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:13.580\nthe effect of that person's thought\nprocess distilled down into something.\n\n265\n00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:16.230\nIt is creative information\nthey have put together.\n\n266\n00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:19.140\nit's their thoughts, they have a right\nto express them, as long as their not\n\n267\n00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:22.910\nviolating certain rules and or\npolicies in the business, right?\n\n268\n00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:24.010\nYou can't use certain language,\n\n269\n00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:26.480\nyou're not supposed to do\nthings a certain way, whatever.\n\n270\n00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.510\nAs long as they follow those rules,\nthey have the right to do that and\n\n271\n00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:30.790\nhave that information.\n\n272\n00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:36.160\nAs okay or distasteful as we may find\nthat to be, that is not our call to make,\n\n273\n00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.230\nas long as they have not\nviolated policy and procedure.\n\n274\n00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:41.758\nAnd we have to be aware of that,\nand be sensitive to that,\n\n275\n00:14:41.758 --> 00:14:44.782\nbecause there are certain exceptions,\ncertainly, with the PPA.\n\n276\n00:14:44.782 --> 00:14:49.313\nBut in general, it is designed to help us,\nas incident responders to understand,\n\n277\n00:14:49.313 --> 00:14:51.910\nthat while we may find\nthings that we find.\n\n278\n00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:55.440\nFor any number of reasons\nto be inappropriate,\n\n279\n00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.280\nwe are not necessarily able to\nmake that final determination.\n\n280\n00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.390\nAnd we probably have to bring\nlaw enforcement officials in,\n\n281\n00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:01.450\nin order to that.\n\n282\n00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:04.370\nAnd we may then need to work within\nthe boundaries of what they say\n\n283\n00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:06.910\nwill be the appropriate\nresponses as a result.\n\n284\n00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:10.760\nAnd the PPA, the Privacy Protection Act,\ngives us some information and\n\n285\n00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:14.780\nguidance along those lines, very,\nvery important for us to consider that.\n\n286\n00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:19.600\nWe have to think about the fact that\nmaterials that are being searched, right?\n\n287\n00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:22.980\nSpreadsheets, Word documents,\nPowerPoints, email, who knows what,\n\n288\n00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.310\nthere's all sorts of stuff, right?\n\n289\n00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:26.510\nThe materials are work product materials,\nright?\n\n290\n00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:31.370\nThey are prepared for use author, and or\ncreated In anticipation, the statute says,\n\n291\n00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:34.070\nof communicating such materials\nto the public, right?\n\n292\n00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:36.840\nThis is something that we\nhave to think about because\n\n293\n00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.780\nthere are certain expectations and\n\n294\n00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:42.460\nthe PPA makes it unlawful for\na government officer to search or seize.\n\n295\n00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:44.535\nThese materials that\nfall into this category.\n\n296\n00:15:44.535 --> 00:15:48.380\nSo law enforcement official may not\nbe able to legally search for and\n\n297\n00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:53.452\nseize those materials, right, if they fall\ninto a category of work product materials.\n\n298\n00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:57.603\nUnless they have a warrant and\nthey have this exception under the PPA.\n\n299\n00:15:57.603 --> 00:16:01.562\nSo just kind of thinking about\nhow that intellectual property,\n\n300\n00:16:01.562 --> 00:16:04.290\nthe intent behind it, how it is generated.\n\n301\n00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:08.287\nFor instance if I have a digital journal\nand I'm writing some kind of threatening\n\n302\n00:16:08.287 --> 00:16:11.814\nbut it's just my thoughts versus\npublishing a threat on social media,\n\n303\n00:16:11.814 --> 00:16:13.610\nis that what we're talking about?\n\n304\n00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:17.128\n&gt;&gt; Well, publishing a threat anywhere,\nwherever it is social media or\n\n305\n00:16:17.128 --> 00:16:21.561\notherwise is very different from writing\nsomething let's say personally that's not\n\n306\n00:16:21.561 --> 00:16:23.240\ngonna see the light of day.\n\n307\n00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.000\nYou make a public declaration\n\n308\n00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.433\nthreatening somebody,\n&gt;&gt; That's it?\n\n309\n00:16:26.433 --> 00:16:27.760\n&gt;&gt; You have broken a bunch of laws.\n\n310\n00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:31.616\nAnd that's a whole different playing\nfield and people with badges and guns and\n\n311\n00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:34.360\nradios to call other people\nare gonna come find you.\n\n312\n00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.290\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n313\n00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:37.990\nWherever you live in the word\nthat is just not acceptable.\n\n314\n00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:39.360\nUnder any circumstances.\n\n315\n00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:42.690\nBut if you are writing down these things,\nperhaps in a journal or\n\n316\n00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:47.410\nsome offline form whatever it is,\nthere is a different expectation there.\n\n317\n00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:51.124\nYou are not acting on them, first of all,\nby making them publicly declared and\n\n318\n00:16:51.124 --> 00:16:54.040\ntherefore taking your intent\nto another level, right?\n\n319\n00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.452\nYou may or may not ever act on them.\n\n320\n00:16:56.452 --> 00:16:59.145\nIt'll just be maybe thoughts you have but\nyou may be writing them down and\n\n321\n00:16:59.145 --> 00:17:00.170\nthat might be the end of it.\n\n322\n00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:03.440\nIt's hard for us to say in other words,\nwhat you would or would not do.\n\n323\n00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.690\nIf we find those things in the course\nof searching for other stuff.\n\n324\n00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:09.310\nWe may certainly have reason\nto question you about them.\n\n325\n00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:09.985\nCherokee, what's going on with this?\n\n326\n00:17:09.985 --> 00:17:10.850\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n327\n00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:12.380\n&gt;&gt; Seems like you really have\na big issue with Daniel.\n\n328\n00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:16.709\nWasn't really sure why, but\nwow, every page unhappy stuff.\n\n329\n00:17:16.709 --> 00:17:20.668\nAnd so that kind of thing right,\nmaybe a problem if we find it but\n\n330\n00:17:20.668 --> 00:17:22.850\nunder different circumstances.\n\n331\n00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:25.980\nBut no we don't have the right to come\nin and just say show me your diary\n\n332\n00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:29.670\nshow me you journal because we\nthink that you're doing this.\n\n333\n00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:32.392\nBut if you've posted on Facebook\nthat you don't like somebody and\n\n334\n00:17:32.392 --> 00:17:34.148\nyou're writing about it in your journal.\n\n335\n00:17:34.148 --> 00:17:37.058\nWe have the right to come and ask you\nquestions about that because you've made\n\n336\n00:17:37.058 --> 00:17:39.139\nit public and\nyou've made other people aware of that.\n\n337\n00:17:39.139 --> 00:17:41.112\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah there is a line there and\n\n338\n00:17:41.112 --> 00:17:42.400\na distinction.\n\n339\n00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.120\nNo doubt about it.\n\n340\n00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:46.080\nSo wanna make sure that we also\nunderstand on the flip side with the PPA,\n\n341\n00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.560\nthat there are searches and\n\n342\n00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:51.730\nactivities that are curved out as\nexceptions that don't violate the PPA.\n\n343\n00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:55.430\nSo talk about some that may,\nwe've talked about the fact that we\n\n344\n00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:58.810\nmaybe able to be on the side let's talk\nabout some that may not violate the PPA.\n\n345\n00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:02.770\nSo, If the only material search for\nor seized are contraband,\n\n346\n00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:07.793\ninstrumentalities, or fruits of a crime,\nthen that does not violate the PPA.\n\n347\n00:18:07.793 --> 00:18:13.333\nSo again, according to the actual language\nin the statute, if we are searching and\n\n348\n00:18:13.333 --> 00:18:17.390\nwe find contraband or\nevidence of a crime, we can grab that.\n\n349\n00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:20.745\nWe don't need an exception under\nthe PPA to do that, because as we said,\n\n350\n00:18:20.745 --> 00:18:24.596\nif you have made a public declaration,\nabout the fact you don't like this person,\n\n351\n00:18:24.596 --> 00:18:26.315\nyou're gonna do something to them.\n\n352\n00:18:26.315 --> 00:18:29.230\nAnd you wrote that down and\nwe come and find evidence of that,\n\n353\n00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:32.549\nthat's a whole different ball game\nbecause you've made it clear and\n\n354\n00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:34.720\nnow we have the right to come and search.\n\n355\n00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.720\nAnd if we find it, there is no\nprotection under the PPA for that.\n\n356\n00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.179\nYou're not allowed to do those things.\n\n357\n00:18:39.179 --> 00:18:42.961\nOr there was reason to believe that\nthe immediate seizure of such materials is\n\n358\n00:18:42.961 --> 00:18:46.161\nnecessary to prevent death or\nserious bodily injury, as I said,\n\n359\n00:18:46.161 --> 00:18:48.010\nexigent circumstance, right?\n\n360\n00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:51.520\nSo if we think somebody is about\nto be harmed we have the right and\n\n361\n00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:56.190\nthe ability to do things in the way that\nnormally we may not in order to safeguard\n\n362\n00:18:56.190 --> 00:19:00.140\nthat life and safeguard that person\nunder almost any interpretation of law.\n\n363\n00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.280\nSo we wanna be aware of that.\n\n364\n00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.830\nSo these are the kinds of\nthings that will come up and\n\n365\n00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:08.320\nthat we have to think about\nagain as incident responders.\n\n366\n00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:12.250\nIf I find somebody's ramblings and\nmusings in a document on their desktop\n\n367\n00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:15.540\nthrough incident response that\nsays they're going to show up.\n\n368\n00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:18.507\nAnd they're going to do harm to people or\ndo something, obviously,\n\n369\n00:19:18.507 --> 00:19:21.744\nnever want this to happen, but\nthey're going to show up and do something.\n\n370\n00:19:21.744 --> 00:19:24.410\nAnd we have a timeline and a plan.\n\n371\n00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:27.510\nWe have a responsibility and\na requirement to make\n\n372\n00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:31.800\neverybody aware of that immediately and\ncall law enforcement and anybody else\n\n373\n00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.290\nthat's gonna help us to prevent that\nkind of activity from taking place.\n\n374\n00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:39.915\nSo there definitely are reasons why we\ncan go around those requirements, but\n\n375\n00:19:39.915 --> 00:19:43.520\nthey almost without exception always deal\nwith imminent threat or bodily harm.\n\n376\n00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.580\nAnd if that's not the case,\n\n377\n00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:46.990\nit's very unlikely that that\nexception would be granted.\n\n378\n00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:47.615\nSo wanna think about that.\n\n379\n00:19:47.615 --> 00:19:49.731\nWe also the idea, the thought process,\n\n380\n00:19:49.731 --> 00:19:52.730\nof probable cause is another\nway of thinking about this.\n\n381\n00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:53.540\nThis comes up a lot,\n\n382\n00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:57.130\nand we actually have addressed probable\ncause in some of the other conversations.\n\n383\n00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:59.960\nProbable cause is something we\nwould often think about as well.\n\n384\n00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.983\nWe talked about it in the last episode,\nactually, with regards to the example of\n\n385\n00:20:02.983 --> 00:20:05.575\na law enforcement official pulling\nyou over while you're driving.\n\n386\n00:20:05.575 --> 00:20:09.970\nAnd seeing some kind of erratic\nbehavior or something like that.\n\n387\n00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:13.345\nAsk you some questions and\nthen deciding to search the car\n\n388\n00:20:13.345 --> 00:20:16.797\nbased on the responses were\nthe activity or lack there of.\n\n389\n00:20:16.797 --> 00:20:19.425\nThey get because they may think that they\n\n390\n00:20:19.425 --> 00:20:22.990\nhave reasonable expectations\nthat your up to no good.\n\n391\n00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:24.760\nAnd they have probable cause.\n\n392\n00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.410\nThat is something you often\nhear talked about and\n\n393\n00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:29.190\nsomething you will hear discussed\nwith regardless of this.\n\n394\n00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:32.829\nProbable cause is one of those grey areas\nnot because is not well defined but\n\n395\n00:20:32.829 --> 00:20:36.468\nbecause and I made this point when we\ntalked about in the last episode we're\n\n396\n00:20:36.468 --> 00:20:40.343\ntalking about law enforcement officials\nhere traditionally that operate with\n\n397\n00:20:40.343 --> 00:20:41.989\nvery large amounts of training.\n\n398\n00:20:41.989 --> 00:20:45.989\nAnd a very very clearly defined\nmandate under the law to do things and\n\n399\n00:20:45.989 --> 00:20:50.268\nbe given rights to do things that normal\ncitizens are not trained to do and\n\n400\n00:20:50.268 --> 00:20:52.960\ndon't know necessarily the boundaries of.\n\n401\n00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.400\nAnd so when we extrapolate\nthis conversation out and\n\n402\n00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:59.680\ntalk about it from that perspective, when\nwe talk about things like probable cause.\n\n403\n00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:03.340\nThose are really conversations in terms\nthat are really best left in that\n\n404\n00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:06.730\nenvironment, in that area where law\nenforcement officials are operating.\n\n405\n00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:10.410\nBecause private individuals\ndon't exercise probable cause\n\n406\n00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:12.430\nas a justification for searching.\n\n407\n00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:16.320\nWe don't have to because we're not\nbound by the same legal requirements.\n\n408\n00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.870\nWe can execute a warrant with search and\nnot have to worry about violating\n\n409\n00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:23.720\nsomeone's fourth amendment rights cuz\nwe're not operating as a law enforcement\n\n410\n00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.640\nor government representative or\nofficial in the first place.\n\n411\n00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:31.380\nSo as a result we wouldn't be asked to\njustify our activities and say, well,\n\n412\n00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:34.320\nwe thought probable cause was this or\nthat and this is why.\n\n413\n00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:37.740\nCuz we don't have the same legal\nrestrictions and frameworks in place.\n\n414\n00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:39.070\nSo it's important to make the distinction.\n\n415\n00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:42.900\nIt's very important word or two words,\nvery important concept, and\n\n416\n00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.850\none that we have to make\nsure we're clear on.\n\n417\n00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:48.260\nBut it's also one that we don't\nnecessarily come up against as incident\n\n418\n00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:52.620\nresponders because we're not operating as\nlaw enforcement officials traditionally.\n\n419\n00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:56.010\nNow there is a whole area of\nincident response that deals, right,\n\n420\n00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:59.190\nwith law enforcement and\nlaw enforcement activities and\n\n421\n00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:03.020\nlaw enforcement officials responding\nas part of incident response.\n\n422\n00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:06.620\nBut that then mixes the two and then\nthat does fall under the jurisdiction,\n\n423\n00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:08.970\nthe guise of these broader conversations.\n\n424\n00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:12.150\nBut when we're talking about this,and\nlaying out the legal framework so\n\n425\n00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:12.960\nto speak.\n\n426\n00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:17.090\nWe're really thinking about it from the\nperspective of a law enforcement official\n\n427\n00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:21.530\nthat may be responding because\nthe private citizen can do so but\n\n428\n00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:24.400\noften does so\nwithout the shackles if you will, right?\n\n429\n00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:27.040\nThe restrictions of the legal frameworks\n\n430\n00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.090\nthat the law enforcement\nofficials must follow.\n\n431\n00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:31.550\nAnd rightly so\nin order to safeguard their rights but\n\n432\n00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:34.410\nalso our privacy and\nour expectation to privacy and\n\n433\n00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:36.850\nour responsibilities cut\nboth ways in this regard.\n\n434\n00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:39.190\nSo it's a really important dialog to have,\nbut\n\n435\n00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:43.090\nprobable cause is typically not something\nas an instance responder as an individual\n\n436\n00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:45.940\noperating outside the framework of\nbeing a law enforcement official.\n\n437\n00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:46.920\nWe would often think about.\n\n438\n00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.380\nWe don't have to justify our activities,\n\n439\n00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:50.790\nin other words,\nthat way more often then not.\n\n440\n00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:54.140\nJust want to think about, also, for a\nminute or two as we're talking about this.\n\n441\n00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:55.900\nSlightly different approach.\n\n442\n00:22:55.900 --> 00:23:00.360\nTalked a lot about privacy, and\nexpectation, and search, and seizure, and\n\n443\n00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:01.400\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n444\n00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.147\nBut what we haven't really talked about\nis the concept of intellectual privacy.\n\n445\n00:23:04.147 --> 00:23:06.760\nAnd intellectual property and\nprivacy both.\n\n446\n00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.443\nBut we've talk about intellectual,\nprivacy generically, but\n\n447\n00:23:09.443 --> 00:23:10.867\nintellectual property overall.\n\n448\n00:23:10.867 --> 00:23:13.170\nWhat is intellectual property?\n\n449\n00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:15.450\nHow do we define it, why is it important?\n\n450\n00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:20.154\nWe think about things like the ability\nto be able to create words and\n\n451\n00:23:20.154 --> 00:23:24.270\ncreate software and paint pictures and\nhave the recipe for\n\n452\n00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:29.495\nsome sort of thing or the plans and\nblueprints, whatever the case may be.\n\n453\n00:23:29.495 --> 00:23:31.512\nAnd all these things can be,\nand indeed are,\n\n454\n00:23:31.512 --> 00:23:34.090\nnormally classified as\nintellectual property.\n\n455\n00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:36.910\nBut, we have different laws and\ndifferent things that protect them.\n\n456\n00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:39.113\nWe have copyrights, trademarks, patents.\n\n457\n00:23:39.113 --> 00:23:41.559\nSo we have to think about\nsome of these things and\n\n458\n00:23:41.559 --> 00:23:44.626\nunderstand the classification\nschemes that go with them.\n\n459\n00:23:44.626 --> 00:23:49.127\nA copyright is used In order to be\nable to protect and broadly classify\n\n460\n00:23:49.127 --> 00:23:54.499\nintellectual property as is the moniker\nthe tag of industrial property overall.\n\n461\n00:23:54.499 --> 00:23:57.270\nAnd these are the two main\ncategories that we think about.\n\n462\n00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:59.820\nCopyrighted material is protected.\n\n463\n00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:04.747\nThe product of intellect and\nthings like literary works,\n\n464\n00:24:04.747 --> 00:24:07.270\nartistic works, things like that.\n\n465\n00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:11.966\nSoftware can actually be copyrighted now\nunder the Digital Rights Millennium Act.\n\n466\n00:24:11.966 --> 00:24:16.147\nThese are things that are gonna be\nthe fruit of somebody's intellectual\n\n467\n00:24:16.147 --> 00:24:17.560\nmusings and labor.\n\n468\n00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:20.555\nThey're gonna be protected and\nthey cannot be reproduced or\n\n469\n00:24:20.555 --> 00:24:22.795\ncopied without\nthe permission of the owner.\n\n470\n00:24:22.795 --> 00:24:24.699\nAnd if they are found to\nbe having done so, so\n\n471\n00:24:24.699 --> 00:24:28.354\nsomebody knocks them off, essentially\ncounterfeits them or uses them illegally,\n\n472\n00:24:28.354 --> 00:24:31.710\nthere's simply a financial penalty\ninvolved when you violate a copyright.\n\n473\n00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:33.730\nSo a lot of times you'll see\nin the beginning of a book,\n\n474\n00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:36.460\nyou open it up to the first page or\ntwo, copyrighted,\n\n475\n00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:39.475\nthe circle c copyright\nprotection that we often see.\n\n476\n00:24:39.475 --> 00:24:42.195\nAnd it says you're not able\nto reproduce under penalty\n\n477\n00:24:42.195 --> 00:24:43.925\nof whatever the law is that they quote.\n\n478\n00:24:43.925 --> 00:24:46.600\nAnd that means that if you're\nfound to violate the copyright,\n\n479\n00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:49.255\nas I said, you may actually\nbe financially held liable.\n\n480\n00:24:49.255 --> 00:24:50.711\nThere's a criminal clause as well.\n\n481\n00:24:50.711 --> 00:24:53.390\nYou may go to jail depending on it but\ntypically more often than not,\n\n482\n00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:54.582\nit's a financial penalty.\n\n483\n00:24:54.582 --> 00:24:56.852\nSo I wanna make sure we're aware of that?\n\n484\n00:24:56.852 --> 00:25:00.102\n&gt;&gt; Adam, are there situations\nwhere I may waive that right?\n\n485\n00:25:00.102 --> 00:25:03.098\nFor instance, I worked for a company,\nI think I've mentioned it before.\n\n486\n00:25:03.098 --> 00:25:07.679\nBut I actually had to sign during that\nonboarding process a document in my\n\n487\n00:25:07.679 --> 00:25:11.884\ncontract that stated that any idea\nthat I had six months thereafter\n\n488\n00:25:11.884 --> 00:25:16.692\nthe termination of that agreement or\nthat relationship, the company still\n\n489\n00:25:16.692 --> 00:25:21.680\nhad rights to my intellectual property if\nI came up with an idea or a prototype.\n\n490\n00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.935\nSo do we see that happening?\n\n491\n00:25:23.935 --> 00:25:25.085\n&gt;&gt; We certainly can.\n\n492\n00:25:25.085 --> 00:25:29.955\nThat's one of those things that you as the\nindividual are essentially giving up your\n\n493\n00:25:29.955 --> 00:25:32.945\nclaim to own that property because\nthe company is saying, well,\n\n494\n00:25:32.945 --> 00:25:34.085\nwe're paying your salary.\n\n495\n00:25:34.085 --> 00:25:34.965\nYou're working for us.\n\n496\n00:25:34.965 --> 00:25:39.630\nWe're providing you the resources and the\ntools necessary to create this environment\n\n497\n00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:42.730\nwhere essentially you can come up with\nthis stuff and as a result, the fruit of\n\n498\n00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:45.590\nyour labor belongs to us because\nwe're paying you in advance for it.\n\n499\n00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:49.550\nSo if they do that, we're not\nabrogating the right to the copyright,\n\n500\n00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:52.360\nwe're simply transferring it\nfrom you to the business.\n\n501\n00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:54.440\nAnd the business holds and\nowns that and says,\n\n502\n00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:55.770\nwell, it's our intellectual property.\n\n503\n00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:58.830\nSo as a result,\nwe're going to stand on and protect it.\n\n504\n00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:01.345\nEven though Cherokee may have\ncome up with it, essentially,\n\n505\n00:26:01.345 --> 00:26:03.160\nwe're the ones that now rightfully own it.\n\n506\n00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:07.530\nSo we see a shifting, if you will,\nin the owner of the copyright,\n\n507\n00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:08.860\nthe copyright is still-\n&gt;&gt; Transference.\n\n508\n00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:09.410\n&gt;&gt; Or transference.\n\n509\n00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:12.490\nThe copyright is still enforced,\nthat intellectual property will still be\n\n510\n00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:15.566\nprotected, but unfortunately, you're not\ngoing to benefit from it financially.\n\n511\n00:26:15.566 --> 00:26:16.656\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Somebody else is.\n\n512\n00:26:16.656 --> 00:26:18.440\nBut yeah, you may be asked, and\n\n513\n00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:23.280\nit's not uncommon at all in many work\nenvironments, depending upon what you do.\n\n514\n00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.800\nThink about the programmers.\n\n515\n00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.780\nPeople that write software from\nMicrosoft and all these companies.\n\n516\n00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:30.940\nI mean there's a group of people,\nnot one person who created Windows.\n\n517\n00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:34.105\nBut hat team doesn't own the rights to\nevery copy of Windows that gets sold.\n\n518\n00:26:34.105 --> 00:26:35.934\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They don't get money every time Windows\n\n519\n00:26:35.934 --> 00:26:36.450\ngets sold.\n\n520\n00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:37.560\nThat would be cool, right?\n\n521\n00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:38.980\nBut it's not that way.\n\n522\n00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:43.410\nMicrosoft as a company owns the right to\nthat software and benefits from that and\n\n523\n00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:44.750\nholds those copyrights.\n\n524\n00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:49.110\nThey pay those people very well but those\npeople have no claim on that software.\n\n525\n00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:50.870\nNo claim on that copyright at all.\n\n526\n00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:51.390\nSo, yeah,\n\n527\n00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:55.900\nit's very common in that respect that\nthat may happen, so not unusual, right?\n\n528\n00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:58.330\nIf you wanna do that, you gotta go\ninto business for yourself, right?\n\n529\n00:26:58.330 --> 00:26:59.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's how that works.\n\n530\n00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:02.640\nSo just be aware of the fact\nthat there are categories\n\n531\n00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:07.620\nof intellectual property protection, that\nwe should, as incident responders also,\n\n532\n00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:09.160\njust be knowledgeable about, come across.\n\n533\n00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:12.460\nWe're gonna see things on machines\nthat may be copyrighted and protected.\n\n534\n00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:15.650\nWe have to understand that and know that\nand know that although we may have to\n\n535\n00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:18.380\nreproduce them as part of the body\nof evidence of an incident and\n\n536\n00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:21.430\nan incident report, we can't go\ninto business for ourselves, right?\n\n537\n00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:24.970\nYou can't take the pre-production\ncopy of Harry Potter you found\n\n538\n00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:28.810\non JK Rowling's machine because you\nhad an incident associated with it and\n\n539\n00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:32.410\ngo out and sell it because you\nfound it before that happened.\n\n540\n00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:36.170\nThat would not be acceptable behavior or\nwhatever your equivalent would be.\n\n541\n00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:38.850\nI would say JRR Tolkien but\nthat would date me, and\n\n542\n00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:40.560\nhe's been dead for quite some time.\n\n543\n00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.140\nBut you get the general idea, right?\n\n544\n00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:43.600\nWe can't do those kind of things.\n\n545\n00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:47.660\nSo it is important for us as incident\nresponders to understand that as well.\n\n546\n00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:49.960\nAll right, I think that's about it for\nthis particular episode.\n\n547\n00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:51.878\nWe've covered a lot and\nI'll tell you what, Adam,\n\n548\n00:27:51.878 --> 00:27:56.030\n[LAUGH] I don't know if I wanna go\ninto a law degree after all this but\n\n549\n00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:59.600\nI think it's a great place at least to\nbegin understanding what I'm responsible\n\n550\n00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:03.450\nfor and what I'm be getting into from\nan incident responder perspective.\n\n551\n00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:06.850\nSo thank you so much for that and thank\nyou ladies and gentlemen for tuning in.\n\n552\n00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:07.860\nBut that's it for this show.\n\n553\n00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:09.750\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nsign off as your host.\n\n554\n00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:11.090\nI'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n555\n00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:12.300\n&gt;&gt; I am Adam Gordon.\n\n556\n00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:15.259\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n557\n00:28:15.259 --> 00:28:21.249\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n558\n00:28:21.249 --> 00:28:23.110\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",
