They begin by explaining how to identify the symptoms of a malware infection. Then they demonstrate the ways in which you would quarantine the infected system followed by remediation using both built-in and 3rd-party antivirus/antimalware tools like HouseCall and Malwarebytes. Finally, they look at using bootable media with stand-alone antivirus software like Kaspersky Rescue Disk 10, for the most difficult cases.",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.341\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:18.341 --> 00:00:22.210\nIn today's episode, we're gonna\nbe talking eliminating malware.\n\n5\n00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.180\nJoining me in the studio today to help us\nin that very endeavor is none other than\n\n6\n00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.130\nour good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.430\nWes, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:28.980\nHow's it going today?\n\n9\n00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.240\n>> It's going great and\nas always Dan, it's good to be here.\n\n10\n00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.030\nThat's right and in today's episode,\n\n11\n00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.950\nwe're gonna be looking at a few\nof the I should say techniques\n\n12\n00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.830\nthat you can use in order to eliminate\nmalware that are on your systems.\n\n13\n00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.610\nNow we're gonna use\nabout a six step method.\n\n14\n00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.780\nWe're going to take care of a few\nthings here in the first episode.\n\n15\n00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.170\nIt's gonna be starting\nout with identification.\n\n16\n00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.860\nNow, when we look at malware one of the\nbiggest things that we need to start with,\n\n17\n00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.550\nregardless of what technology used, what\ntype of operating system you're using,\n\n18\n00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.450\nwhatever software you're using whether\nyour systems are up to date, right?\n\n19\n00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.370\nAll good stuff.\n\n20\n00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.050\nIt starts with awareness, right?\n\n21\n00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.280\nWhen we look at a layered defense system,\nif you're not aware that\n\n22\n00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.620\ncertain things can happen, then you're not\nreally gonna be aware of the potential\n\n23\n00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.060\ncauses that they can have and\nmuch less being able to mitigate them.\n\n24\n00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.580\nSo it really starts with identification.\n\n25\n00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.390\nNow, what are some of the things\nwe can use to identify\n\n26\n00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.990\nMalware on our systems, right?\n\n27\n00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.250\nWell we've got antivirus software,\nof course.\n\n28\n00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.330\nBut sometimes we can use other types of\nsymptoms that can lead us into believing,\n\n29\n00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.660\nwell maybe there is some malware.\n\n30\n00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.250\nLet me show you what I mean,\nI've got a diagram here.\n\n31\n00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.640\nAnd with identification, some of\nthe things that we have to look at is,\n\n32\n00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.010\nDan I think of things like excessive\nresource utilization, right?\n\n33\n00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.210\nIf you have things like system hangs.\n\n34\n00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.460\nEver try to launch an application and\nthat applications just sits here,\n\n35\n00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.980\nit's like it's thinking about it.\n\n36\n00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:49.970\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n37\n00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.260\nI've actually got a machine here that's\ngot a lot of stuff going on right now.\n\n38\n00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.210\nYou can see Dan here,\nwe got some CPU utilization going on here.\n\n39\n00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.950\nAnd I've noticed that it's actually\ncoming back down a little bit.\n\n40\n00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.680\nSometimes, it goes all\nthe way up to about 98%.\n\n41\n00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.270\nLook at our memory, Dan,\nit's just pegged, right.\n\n42\n00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.320\nAlmost completely utilized.\n\n43\n00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.979\nAnd the disk?\n\n44\n00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.303\nThe disk is through the roof right?\n\n45\n00:02:11.303 --> 00:02:12.240\nIt's table topped.\n\n46\n00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.590\nSo these are some of the things\nthat you can see when it comes to\n\n47\n00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.450\nviruses being on your systems.\n\n48\n00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.990\nNotice that we've got excessive resource\nutilization and I'm not doing anything.\n\n49\n00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.160\nI just started the computer up.\n\n50\n00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.420\nAlright, and we've got some problems.\n\n51\n00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.020\nThis could be some of the things\nthat could lead you to believe that\n\n52\n00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.070\nmaybe we got a virus, right?\n\n53\n00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.180\n>> Yeah, that's exactly right.\n\n54\n00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.800\nThis is definitely a sure fire sign that\nyour computer has some sort of problem.\n\n55\n00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.450\nNow Wes,\nwhat was it that lead you to open?\n\n56\n00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.790\nObviously we've got the performance\nmonitor up and running so\n\n57\n00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:44.970\nyou can see all these things.\n\n58\n00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.160\nWhat lead you to go there?\n\n59\n00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.730\nWhat would lead someone to open\nthat up as a first step to\n\n60\n00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:51.900\ntrying to identify the problem?\n\n61\n00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.450\n>> That's right Dan.\n\n62\n00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.420\nOne of the things that would lead me\nto believe that it's time to launch\n\n63\n00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.650\nTask Manager is when I'm loading for\ninstance applications.\n\n64\n00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.900\nApplications that I expect to run right?\n\n65\n00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.255\nMaybe yesterday I was\nusing an application.\n\n66\n00:03:04.255 --> 00:03:07.549\nEverything's running fine and all of the\nsudden today I launch my computer up and\n\n67\n00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.990\nI haven't changed anything and I'm trying\nto load some of those applications up and\n\n68\n00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.602\nunfortunately they're not loading.\n\n69\n00:03:12.602 --> 00:03:17.440\nSo that might lead me to believe that\nmaybe I've got a process that's running on\n\n70\n00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.386\nthis machine.\n\n71\n00:03:18.386 --> 00:03:21.146\nAnd I might even know that it's malware,\nright, I might just think\n\n72\n00:03:21.146 --> 00:03:24.005\nthat I've got some background services or\nsomething I need to close,\n\n73\n00:03:24.005 --> 00:03:27.500\nmaybe I've got something started up\nthat's really bogging down my start time.\n\n74\n00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.140\nLet me show you what I mean here, in Task\nManager it does give you the ability to\n\n75\n00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.630\nfind the different processes that\nyou have running on machines.\n\n76\n00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.670\nWhat's really cool,\nI really like about this\n\n77\n00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.570\nis the fact that you can tell what the\nprocess is and what it's associated with.\n\n78\n00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.200\nIf you ever get something in here\nthat has like asterisk in it,\n\n79\n00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.880\nthat'd be my first sign of you\nmight wanna worry about that one.\n\n80\n00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.730\nIf it doesn't tell you\nwhat the process is,\n\n81\n00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.000\nit's probably cuz it really\ndoesn't want you to know.\n\n82\n00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.140\nSo it is a good way to kind of\nget some information again.\n\n83\n00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.470\nRemember it's about identification.\n\n84\n00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.253\nWe, at this point, really don't\nknow if If we do have a virus,\n\n85\n00:03:59.253 --> 00:04:02.036\nwe're just trying to isolate down for\ninstance at this point,\n\n86\n00:04:02.036 --> 00:04:04.836\nwhy we're having performance\nissues inside of the computer.\n\n87\n00:04:04.836 --> 00:04:08.229\n>> Yeah, Wes, and this is something\nI've worked on many a help desks.\n\n88\n00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:12.941\nI've helped many a people through\nremediating viruses on their computer and\n\n89\n00:04:12.941 --> 00:04:15.670\nthis is definitely where we always start.\n\n90\n00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.800\nWhat is it that's causing this problem?\n\n91\n00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.168\nTask manager helps us with that because\nit's showing all the processes that\n\n92\n00:04:20.168 --> 00:04:21.420\nare running on our computer.\n\n93\n00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.000\nWhen you start seeing stuff like what Wes\nwas talking about, crazy names that don't\n\n94\n00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.030\nmake sense, there's this really cool\ntool available to us on the internet.\n\n95\n00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.875\nIt's called Google.\n\n96\n00:04:29.875 --> 00:04:30.807\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n97\n00:04:30.807 --> 00:04:35.136\n>> And we are able to take that name and\nGoogle it, and you will find out whether\n\n98\n00:04:35.136 --> 00:04:39.417\nor not that is a legitimate process,\nor maybe it's some sort of malware.\n\n99\n00:04:39.417 --> 00:04:42.354\nAnd I'm being facetious,\nI'm having a good time with,\n\n100\n00:04:42.354 --> 00:04:46.650\nhaving a little fun there saying\nGoogle's our tool but it really is.\n\n101\n00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.790\nIn one hand that is a serious thing to\ntake that name, throw it into Google and\n\n102\n00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:51.800\nsee what comes back.\n\n103\n00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.470\nIf it says how to remove the blankety\nblank blank blank virus and\n\n104\n00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.280\nyou're like, well that's exactly\nwhat I have on my computer.\n\n105\n00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.000\nNow I know that this is the culprit.\n\n106\n00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.520\nI've identified it and\n\n107\n00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.880\nnow I've got to move towards some sort\nof remediation tool or take some steps.\n\n108\n00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.540\nMaybe I'm going to read a forum post.\n\n109\n00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.755\nBut we're going to give you some\ntips to do this as well today, but\n\n110\n00:05:10.755 --> 00:05:11.993\nthis is where it begins.\n\n111\n00:05:11.993 --> 00:05:13.746\nYou have to find out who, or\n\n112\n00:05:13.746 --> 00:05:17.570\nwhat, is causing the problem\nbefore you can move forward.\n\n113\n00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.436\nCuz if it's just hey,\nyou've got a lot of downloads going on and\n\n114\n00:05:20.436 --> 00:05:23.954\nyou're computer's running slow,\nwell then that's not a problem, right?\n\n115\n00:05:23.954 --> 00:05:25.840\nThat's something you're\ndoing purposefully.\n\n116\n00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.580\nIf you're rendering graphics, that's\nsomething you're doing purposefully, and\n\n117\n00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.050\nof course your computer's\ngonna run slowly.\n\n118\n00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.250\nBut if you just rebooted it, and\nyou're just trying to open a spreadsheet,\n\n119\n00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.780\nyou're trying to write in a Word document,\nyou're trying to check your email and\n\n120\n00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.210\nthe thing is running like a one legged dog\nWell, that is a good, and it shouldn't,\n\n121\n00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.740\nthat's a good thing that we need to start\nlooking for, identifying the culprits.\n\n122\n00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.000\n>> Definitely, so remember identification,\nuse some of your techniques.\n\n123\n00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.570\nWhat has changed, you know?\n\n124\n00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:50.380\nOne of the things that we,\n\n125\n00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.300\nwhat has changed since the last\ntime the system is running right.\n\n126\n00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.210\nIs it something that you've changed,\nis it maybe a website that you've visited.\n\n127\n00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.787\nNow some of you guys might\nbe saying out there,\n\n128\n00:06:00.787 --> 00:06:02.170\nwell just don't visit those websites.\n\n129\n00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:07.163\nWell, it's just not that easy,\nwe're not talking about anything\n\n130\n00:06:07.163 --> 00:06:11.119\nscandalous if you will or\ncriminal type activities.\n\n131\n00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:13.216\nWhat we're talking about\nis something like going for\n\n132\n00:06:13.216 --> 00:06:15.790\ninstance to the classified ad\nwhere they're doing job posting.\n\n133\n00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.860\nIn fact, I did have somebody that\nI knew that was posting job sites,\n\n134\n00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.100\nor what it was, help wanted ads.\n\n135\n00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.810\nRight, well when they started getting\nthe responses back, guess what?\n\n136\n00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.690\nAttachments, attachments to the responses\nback started to infect the machine, so-\n\n137\n00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:30.500\n>> That's my resume.\n\n138\n00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.260\n>> That's exactly, here's my resume.\n\n139\n00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:32.990\n>> Resume.\n>> [LAUGH] And\n\n140\n00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.700\nnow enjoy your gift that keeps giving.\n\n141\n00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.670\nNow the next thing that we\nhave to look at is quarantine.\n\n142\n00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.590\nOkay.\nQuarantine is important right.\n\n143\n00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.340\nOnce we have identified that hey we\ndo have something on the system.\n\n144\n00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.598\nNow what we have to do, what we wanna\nmake sure that we isolate it so\n\n145\n00:06:48.598 --> 00:06:51.275\nthat it doesn't start to\ninfect other machines, right.\n\n146\n00:06:51.275 --> 00:06:55.105\nIn today's day and age, every computer\nthat you have is pretty much networked.\n\n147\n00:06:55.105 --> 00:06:58.125\nWe're far past the days when\nyou'd have a computer that\n\n148\n00:06:58.125 --> 00:07:02.005\nreally isn't networked outside of some,\nmaybe some extreme security purpose.\n\n149\n00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:03.265\nSo let's look at this.\n\n150\n00:07:03.265 --> 00:07:07.495\nQuarantine, it doesn't matter\nif you have a wired network or\n\n151\n00:07:07.495 --> 00:07:08.875\nif you have a wireless network, right.\n\n152\n00:07:08.875 --> 00:07:12.240\nIf I'm holding a plug in my hand that goes\nto my network adapter I know it's not\n\n153\n00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.990\ngonna affect other machines on my network,\nand that's a good thing, all right?\n\n154\n00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:17.250\nYou can go a little bit further than that.\n\n155\n00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:18.540\nWe can show you this too here.\n\n156\n00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.870\nSo I've got a Windows 10 machine.\n\n157\n00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.210\nAnd down in the bottom here,\n\n158\n00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:26.470\nwhat I have here is you can\nsee a wireless adapter, right?\n\n159\n00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.200\nSo it doesn't matter if\nit's a wireless adapter.\n\n160\n00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.980\nI know my head's kinda\ncovering it up here.\n\n161\n00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.210\nThe wireless adapter,\nit could be disabled very, very easily.\n\n162\n00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:40.550\nI'm just going to right click on it so I\ncan get out and show you that right there.\n\n163\n00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:41.830\nAnd here's my network adapter.\n\n164\n00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:45.210\nAnd you can wireless adapter on all I\ngotta do is I can right-click on it and\n\n165\n00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:46.390\nI can disable it.\n\n166\n00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:49.498\nNow that's gonna disconnect me from\nmy remote desktop session here so\n\n167\n00:07:49.498 --> 00:07:51.141\nwe'll go ahead and cancel that out.\n\n168\n00:07:51.141 --> 00:07:54.114\nAnd I know that this machine is no\nlonger connected to my network.\n\n169\n00:07:54.114 --> 00:07:55.938\nAnd there you can see it shuts down.\n\n170\n00:07:55.938 --> 00:08:00.076\nSo wireless Fairly easy, right,\njust turn off a network adapter,\n\n171\n00:08:00.076 --> 00:08:02.267\nwell wired isn't much different.\n\n172\n00:08:02.267 --> 00:08:05.808\nAnd again you can see it's,\nmy head's kinda covering it up here,\n\n173\n00:08:05.808 --> 00:08:10.047\nif I right-click in the lower righthand\ncorner on that little monitor icon with\n\n174\n00:08:10.047 --> 00:08:13.588\nthe trident pitchfork there,\nI know it's supposed to be a cable,\n\n175\n00:08:13.588 --> 00:08:16.270\nit looks like a pitchfork to me here.\n\n176\n00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:20.040\nAnd I go to adaptor settings, notice, guys\nout there, that nothing's really changed.\n\n177\n00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.470\nThe adaptors look the same, the only\ndifference is, one says wireless and\n\n178\n00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:26.410\nit's got a little wireless information\nthere, maybe your network adaptor, and\n\n179\n00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:29.190\nthe other one here is\na gigabit wired network.\n\n180\n00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:32.550\nWell, easy, pull the plug.\n\n181\n00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:36.149\nBut then I can also come in here and\nI can disable the network adapter, and\n\n182\n00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:38.627\nnow I know that from\na communication standpoint,\n\n183\n00:08:38.627 --> 00:08:42.462\nwe've got some other things that we got\nto do inside of the operating system to\n\n184\n00:08:42.462 --> 00:08:46.127\nensure that our system can be brought\nback online once it's remediated.\n\n185\n00:08:46.127 --> 00:08:49.171\nBut now I know that I'm not\ncommunicating outbound and\n\n186\n00:08:49.171 --> 00:08:52.090\nwe've essentially quarantine\nthat information.\n\n187\n00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:55.380\nNow, I could say, well, guess what?\n\n188\n00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.910\nWe've got the x's over here\ntowards the Internet, well,\n\n189\n00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:03.580\nwe can probably bring those x's if we\nwanted and put them more over here, right?\n\n190\n00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:07.120\nBecause not only do we not want\nconnection out to the internet,\n\n191\n00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.010\nwe don't want connection\ninside of our networks too.\n\n192\n00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:14.190\nBecause just the tendency\nthat viruses have,\n\n193\n00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.430\nI mean it's a virus, so it can spread.\n\n194\n00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.950\nNow there are some things\nthat we want to understand\n\n195\n00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:23.620\ninside of the operating system\nthat we need to do as well.\n\n196\n00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.830\nA lot of times we'll talk about\nthings like, for instance,\n\n197\n00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.110\ndisabling system restore,\nyou probably heard it.\n\n198\n00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:32.360\nI know Dan, you've been in\nsome episodes where they say,\n\n199\n00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.850\nwhen you're thinking about security,\nyou're thinking about malware,\n\n200\n00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:40.250\nyour computer's infected, the first thing\nyou should do is disable system restore.\n\n201\n00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.790\nWell why,\nwhy should I disable a system restore?\n\n202\n00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:45.090\nWell let me go ahead and\nshow you what I mean here.\n\n203\n00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:48.280\nI'm gonna switch over to a Windows 10\nmachine and we're gonna go ahead and\n\n204\n00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.440\nwe're gonna do a system restore.\n\n205\n00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.290\nNow, I'm kind of jumping ahead cuz\nwe wanna show you the remediation,\n\n206\n00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:53.439\nwe're gonna show you that.\n\n207\n00:09:53.439 --> 00:09:59.220\nBut if I have done a system restore,\nand I should be good, right Dan?\n\n208\n00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.860\nI do a system restore, we're back online.\n\n209\n00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.715\nWell, let's find out if that's the case.\n\n210\n00:10:02.715 --> 00:10:06.840\nSo, we're at a Windows 10 machine here,\nI'm gonna right-click\n\n211\n00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:11.510\non the little Windows charm there, icon,\nand I'm gonna choose system protection.\n\n212\n00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:16.460\nAnd when I choose system protection you're\ngonna notice if you look right here that\n\n213\n00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:21.550\nthe Local Disk C does have system\nprotection turned on and if I start\n\n214\n00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:27.180\nto do a system restore, and I can choose\nNext, we'll go through the restore.\n\n215\n00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:31.790\nNotice I got a restore point here,\nDan, I think I'm infected here,\n\n216\n00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:34.660\nit's just easy let's just go ahead and\ndo the restore and we should be good.\n\n217\n00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:37.900\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna pick one of this restore points.\n\n218\n00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.720\nChoose Next, we'll choose Finish.\n\n219\n00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:46.340\nAnd it's gonna tell us say you cannot\ninterrupt this until it's complete.\n\n220\n00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.175\nSo that's got our system restore and\n\n221\n00:10:48.175 --> 00:10:50.520\nwe'll let that go ahead and\nchurn away a little bit.\n\n222\n00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.780\nBut I wanna show you a little bit more\nabout System Restore while that's working\n\n223\n00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:56.510\nin the background, and\nhow you should disable that.\n\n224\n00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:59.020\nAnd we'll show you the why\ncoming up here in a second.\n\n225\n00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:03.190\nSo again in Windows 8.1 machine, it's\nno different, it's the same locations.\n\n226\n00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:05.950\nYou go up to System,\ngo to System Protection.\n\n227\n00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:10.180\nAnd notice that we pretty much got\nthe same thing happening here to.\n\n228\n00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.070\nI've got system restore turned on,\nI know it's turned on\n\n229\n00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:15.630\nbecause this isn't grayed out,\nyou're gonna see that in a second.\n\n230\n00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:18.140\nI don't know if I have any restore points.\n\n231\n00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:21.630\nWell, we can always figure out if we have\nrestore points without going through\n\n232\n00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:24.720\na full system restore,\njust by choosing this Next button.\n\n233\n00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.935\nJust like we did when we chose\nthe restore point in the earlier machine.\n\n234\n00:11:27.935 --> 00:11:31.470\nNow these restore points,\nwhat is the restore point?\n\n235\n00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:33.180\nWhy do we say to delete them?\n\n236\n00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:38.690\nThe restore point is a point-in-time\nsnapshot of the system configuration,\n\n237\n00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:42.060\nand that it's bookmarked if you will,\nit's saved for later.\n\n238\n00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:45.800\nSo that if you do have to restore your\nmachine, let's say in the case of maybe\n\n239\n00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.680\na virus, you can restore it to an earlier\npoint in time in the system configuration.\n\n240\n00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.930\nYour documents are gonna be just fine.\n\n241\n00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:57.000\nThe problem is if the virus is in the\nregistry, which a lot of times they are,\n\n242\n00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.060\nguess what settings also get saved\nin the system restore point?\n\n243\n00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:02.142\nThe registry settings.\n\n244\n00:12:02.142 --> 00:12:07.570\nAnd if you have a virus in the registry\nright now doing its thing,\n\n245\n00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:10.120\nit's also gonna be in the restore points.\n\n246\n00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.370\nSo, we say to disable it.\n\n247\n00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:14.340\nWhy, what happens when you disable it?\n\n248\n00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:15.740\nWell Dan, let's go ahead and show you.\n\n249\n00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:19.140\nSo what we're gonna do here is\nwe're gonna configure this.\n\n250\n00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:23.540\nAnd notice it says turn on system\nprotection or turn off system protection.\n\n251\n00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:26.150\nNow if you're in Windows 7, guys, and\nyou go out there and you say well, Wes,\n\n252\n00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:27.800\nI got one more radial button.\n\n253\n00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.160\nYou have two, I've got three.\n\n254\n00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:34.150\nWell that's cuz in Windows 7 you can\nalso control previous versions, I could\n\n255\n00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:38.490\nsay just restore my previous versions\nof files, don't do a system protection.\n\n256\n00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:40.290\nSo that's another option.\n\n257\n00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:44.510\nEither way, doesn't matter,\nWindows 7, 8, 8.1, Windows 10,\n\n258\n00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:48.080\nyou name it,\nyou turn Disable System Protection.\n\n259\n00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.420\nAnd notice what it's gonna tell you.\n\n260\n00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.970\nRight away it says are you\nsure you wanna do this because\n\n261\n00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:55.280\nall existing restore points\nare gonna be null and void.\n\n262\n00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.790\nThey're gonna be erased, I should say.\n\n263\n00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:00.070\nWe'll go ahead and choose Yes to this,\nand we'll choose OK.\n\n264\n00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.400\nAnd Dan,\nnotice that System Restore is grayed out.\n\n265\n00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:07.600\nThat means that we know it's not turned\non, you've just seen me turn it off.\n\n266\n00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:12.140\nThe other thing, notice I do not\nhave any restore points left.\n\n267\n00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:15.520\nI can't create one, the only thing\nI can do is come back in here and\n\n268\n00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:16.890\nturn this back on.\n\n269\n00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:19.322\nNow let's go ahead Dan,\nlet's check out our machine here.\n\n270\n00:13:19.322 --> 00:13:21.640\nSometimes it takes a little bit\nto do the system restore and\n\n271\n00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:26.690\nit does look like it's finishing up here,\nso we'll give that just a little bit more.\n\n272\n00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:29.830\nAnd I tell you what, a couple other things\nwhile this thing is cooking away here,\n\n273\n00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:34.330\nI wanna talk a little bit about some\nother shared locations that if a machine,\n\n274\n00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:38.520\nyou need to quarantine it, remember, we're\ntrying to get this off of our network, and\n\n275\n00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.730\nwe don't want it to infect\nour other machines.\n\n276\n00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:43.780\nIf you're part of a homegroup,\nwell, what's the homegroup for us?\n\n277\n00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:45.650\nWell, let's go and take a look at that.\n\n278\n00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:47.850\nIf you have any homegroups on your\nnetwork, I am gonna go ahead and\n\n279\n00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:52.500\nget into the control panel here and\nwe'll get into System and Security,\n\n280\n00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.600\noops, wrong side of the river there.\n\n281\n00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.252\nLet's, how about Network and\nInternet and then HomeGroup.\n\n282\n00:13:57.252 --> 00:14:00.110\nNow, HomeGroup, we have to watch, right,\n\n283\n00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:04.500\nbecause with HomeGroup, you're sharing\nall of these different locations.\n\n284\n00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.730\nDan, notice that I am,\nwe'll try not to do that again.\n\n285\n00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:12.310\nI'm sharing pictures, I'm sharing videos,\nI'm sharing music, documents, right.\n\n286\n00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:14.320\nAnd if I'm sharing this with\na machine that's infected or\n\n287\n00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.860\nvice versa this could\ncause a problem as well.\n\n288\n00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:21.120\nSo one of the things I would recommend\nis if you do have other devices that\n\n289\n00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.250\ntemporarily that are part of a home group,\n\n290\n00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:28.960\nwhat I would do is choose this option\nhere, you'll see Leave the HomeGroup.\n\n291\n00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:32.170\nAnd personally I hit the gate running.\n\n292\n00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:32.820\nJust leave it for\n\n293\n00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:37.220\nnow cuz you can always set it back up\nonce you have remediated your system.\n\n294\n00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.340\nDan, I think we're good over here.\n\n295\n00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.060\nLet's go ahead and sign in.\n\n296\n00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:45.380\nA couple other places I want you to\nkeep in mind that you might have to\n\n297\n00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:48.810\ndisconnect from if you have File History.\n\n298\n00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:51.320\nOne of the things that they're\npushing today is File History.\n\n299\n00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.380\nYou can see here that our System Restore,\nDan, is successful.\n\n300\n00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:58.676\nSo we should be clean, we should be ready,\neverything should be good to go.\n\n301\n00:14:58.676 --> 00:15:02.952\nLet me go ahead and\nwe'll get into our Control Panel.\n\n302\n00:15:02.952 --> 00:15:06.580\nI'm kinda having some issues,\nhere, with my computer.\n\n303\n00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.340\nIt doesn't seem to be working right here.\n\n304\n00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.597\nSo we will go ahead and\nget into System and Security,\n\n305\n00:15:12.597 --> 00:15:15.780\nand you'll see that there's File History.\n\n306\n00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:18.610\nWell, with File History I want\nyou to notice something here.\n\n307\n00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:23.510\nNotice that I do have my\ninformation being stored.\n\n308\n00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:27.870\nIt's being sent from this machine\nover to another machine to\n\n309\n00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:31.870\nensure that I can recover\nthis information too.\n\n310\n00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:35.890\nWell you might say, well what's the big\ndeal about keeping that location?\n\n311\n00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:40.560\nWell I want you to look at the personal\nfiles that are being stored across all\n\n312\n00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:43.900\nof these different folders and libraries.\n\n313\n00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:47.786\nCan you imagine, viruses can get\ninto these locations as well.\n\n314\n00:15:47.786 --> 00:15:52.289\nNow one of the things that, you remember\nthat we were saying that sometimes\n\n315\n00:15:52.289 --> 00:15:56.516\nviruses don't manifest themselves and\nyou don't see any symptoms?\n\n316\n00:15:56.516 --> 00:15:58.292\nLet me show you something here.\n\n317\n00:15:58.292 --> 00:16:03.416\nLet me go ahead and\nget down into Windows Defender,\n\n318\n00:16:03.416 --> 00:16:07.240\nand let's look at some history here.\n\n319\n00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.735\nLook at that,\nwe just did a system restore, Dan, right?\n\n320\n00:16:11.735 --> 00:16:12.300\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n321\n00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.890\n>> You've seen it happen, you were there,\nyou were witness to it all,\n\n322\n00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:17.130\nand what happens?\n\n323\n00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:18.730\nWe've got a virus.\n\n324\n00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:20.860\nAll right,\nnotice that it found a virus already,\n\n325\n00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.200\nand it actually didn't even warn us.\n\n326\n00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.673\nThis was silent, and\nwe're not even aware that this happens.\n\n327\n00:16:24.673 --> 00:16:28.966\nAnd you as a tech might say well, wait a\nsec, or even as home user might say, yeah,\n\n328\n00:16:28.966 --> 00:16:30.650\nwe should be good, right?\n\n329\n00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:33.210\nI restored my computer,\nI did exactly what they said.\n\n330\n00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:36.920\nBut the problem is your restore point\nhad a virus in it, all right, and\n\n331\n00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.860\nthis restore point that I\njust restored is infected,\n\n332\n00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.700\nso it's actually gonna be\na continuation of the problem.\n\n333\n00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:46.503\nSo, remember, very easy,\njust as a little recap here,\n\n334\n00:16:46.503 --> 00:16:51.516\nremember that when you get in here,\njust go to system, and look here.\n\n335\n00:16:51.516 --> 00:16:56.110\nIt's telling me, Windows Defender\nrequires your actions here.\n\n336\n00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:58.042\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nchoose configure.\n\n337\n00:16:58.042 --> 00:17:02.020\nWe're gonna disable this,\nturn it off, just like we did before.\n\n338\n00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.990\nAnd now all of those restore\npoints have been cleared.\n\n339\n00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:08.710\nNow we gotta get over here to,\nas far as it goes to like remediations,\n\n340\n00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:11.090\nwe need to get over here to\nWindows Defender and see what's going on.\n\n341\n00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:12.890\n>> Really, really quickly,\nWes, before you jump there,\n\n342\n00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:18.300\nis there any time in which we\ncan trust a restore point?\n\n343\n00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:21.430\n>> There is, and\nthat's a great question to ask.\n\n344\n00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:23.972\nIf you know that you've got\nearlier restore points,\n\n345\n00:17:23.972 --> 00:17:28.140\nall right, maybe you've got something\nlike the system image checkpoint.\n\n346\n00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:32.480\nWhen you first install your operating\nsystem, it does an initial restore point.\n\n347\n00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.960\nThis is before you've installed any\nsoftware, any additional drivers, so\n\n348\n00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.260\nyou could restore back\nto that restore point.\n\n349\n00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:42.030\nKeep in mind that you just wanna pay\nattention to any of the software that's\n\n350\n00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:43.110\ngonna be affected, right?\n\n351\n00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:46.389\nBecause system restore, it's not biased,\nit doesn't pick and choose,\n\n352\n00:17:46.389 --> 00:17:47.857\nit'll uninstall software too.\n\n353\n00:17:47.857 --> 00:17:51.676\nSo just keep that in mind that if you do\ngo to one of those earlier restore points,\n\n354\n00:17:51.676 --> 00:17:56.110\nyeah, that's a viable solution too, but\nit might uninstall some of your software.\n\n355\n00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:58.830\nLet's see what Windows Defender\nis telling us we need to look at.\n\n356\n00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:02.890\nLet's get into a little\nbit of remediation here.\n\n357\n00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:09.565\nAll right, so history, you'll notice\nI'm over here on the history tab,\n\n358\n00:18:09.565 --> 00:18:12.165\nyou have to be an administrator\nto view the details.\n\n359\n00:18:12.165 --> 00:18:14.055\nSo, if you're not\nan administrator on the account,\n\n360\n00:18:14.055 --> 00:18:15.528\nyou won't be able to view these details.\n\n361\n00:18:15.528 --> 00:18:17.597\nAnd if you read Microsoft\ndocumentation on this,\n\n362\n00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:20.306\nit's just because it could contain\nsensitive information, and\n\n363\n00:18:20.306 --> 00:18:23.885\nthey don't want your standard users\nhaving access to that information.\n\n364\n00:18:23.885 --> 00:18:26.790\nSo, all we're gonna do is we're\ngonna put a check mark in here.\n\n365\n00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:27.790\nWe're gonna choose Remove.\n\n366\n00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:34.550\nAnd like magic, hopefully\nWindows Defender has done its job.\n\n367\n00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:37.910\nAnd this is a utility that's\nactually built into the machine, and\n\n368\n00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:39.502\nthat's a great thing to have.\n\n369\n00:18:39.502 --> 00:18:44.395\nIt sets you up initially to\nhave some level of protection.\n\n370\n00:18:44.395 --> 00:18:45.555\nIs it a one stop shop?\n\n371\n00:18:45.555 --> 00:18:47.905\nDoes it solve every single\none of your problems?\n\n372\n00:18:47.905 --> 00:18:50.935\nNo, it doesn't, because if it did,\nwe wouldn't have other third\n\n373\n00:18:50.935 --> 00:18:54.410\nparty companies out there that\nare doing a really good job,\n\n374\n00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:57.360\nmaking a lot of good money\non their products there.\n\n375\n00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:01.150\nSo, you do at least\nhave something on hand.\n\n376\n00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:02.950\nNow the other thing that\nyou can have here too,\n\n377\n00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:04.690\nand let me show you on\nour Windows 8 machine.\n\n378\n00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:07.430\nSo you can see it's kind of\n\n379\n00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:10.690\nrelative to all the Windows machines\nthat you might be supporting.\n\n380\n00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:12.780\nThe other one is something\nknown as the MRT.\n\n381\n00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:16.240\nAll right, if I type in MRT and\nyou've done your Windows updates,\n\n382\n00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:21.000\nI should have something known as\nthe malicious software removal tool kit.\n\n383\n00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.500\nNow we gotta be careful with this\none because unlike Windows Defender,\n\n384\n00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:27.183\nWindows Defender does real\ntime protection, right,\n\n385\n00:19:27.183 --> 00:19:29.122\nit's monitoring things in real time.\n\n386\n00:19:29.122 --> 00:19:32.512\nAnd just like you're seeing, right,\nWindows Defender taking action,\n\n387\n00:19:32.512 --> 00:19:35.410\nmalware detective and\nstarts locking things down.\n\n388\n00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:41.380\nThe MRT is not, and I repeat, is not\na replacement for any virus software.\n\n389\n00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:44.980\nAnd in fact, so much so, guys,\nthat Microsoft even tells you this.\n\n390\n00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:46.310\nI mean, they say it right here, look,\n\n391\n00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:51.660\nthis tool is not a replacement for\nany virus product.\n\n392\n00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:55.190\nHowever, if you need\nsome offline protection,\n\n393\n00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:59.210\nif you need just a quick scan to see if\nit can find it, you at least have it.\n\n394\n00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:04.280\nAnd you can see some of the types\nof viruses and software.\n\n395\n00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.800\nI mean, there's a laundry list here,\nand there's a bunch of them,\n\n396\n00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.970\nbut remember,\nthis is a static database, right?\n\n397\n00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:15.050\nThis is one that's inside of the operating\nsystem, so if you have taken your system\n\n398\n00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:20.150\noffline, you might not get the latest and\ngreatest again, because it's all\n\n399\n00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:24.750\nkinda built into the software itself, but\nit is there and it is available for you.\n\n400\n00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:29.010\nAll right, so\ncouple of things that we can do.\n\n401\n00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:33.170\nAgain, keep in mind that when you're\ndoing your remediation side of it,\n\n402\n00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:37.600\nyou can start with the utilities\nthat are built into the system.\n\n403\n00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.680\nHowever, there are other\nutilities that you can use.\n\n404\n00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.885\nFor instance, you can go up to HouseCall.\n\n405\n00:20:43.885 --> 00:20:45.520\nHouseCall is another one that's out there,\ntoo,\n\n406\n00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:51.590\nand the good thing about HouseCall is\nit works on a lot of different systems.\n\n407\n00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:53.080\nIt's by Trend Micro.\n\n408\n00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:56.570\nKeep in mind that it depends on the\nseverity of whether you can use HouseCall.\n\n409\n00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:58.950\nLet me go ahead and\nshow you that, guys, here.\n\n410\n00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:02.880\nSo HouseCall,\nwhen you go to Trend Micro's site there,\n\n411\n00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:07.010\nyou download it, and you can see you\ndownload a 32 bit and 64 bit system.\n\n412\n00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:09.050\nKeep in mind, though,\nit does need to attach to the Internet.\n\n413\n00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:13.185\nSo, if you're in a situation where it\ndemands bringing this computer offline,\n\n414\n00:21:13.185 --> 00:21:17.910\nHouseCall really isn't gonna work for you,\nbecause it does have to connect outbound.\n\n415\n00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:22.510\nBut if it is something that you think\nyou can stay connected to the Internet,\n\n416\n00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:24.910\nyou can use it, no problem.\n\n417\n00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:26.580\nIt doesn't cause any issues.\n\n418\n00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:30.610\n>> Now, Wes, I know a lot of users, they\nsee the word free attached to something,\n\n419\n00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:32.720\nand they think well, it's not that good.\n\n420\n00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.520\nIt might get a few things, but\n\n421\n00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:37.500\nthis isn't the most robust\nsolution that you can grab.\n\n422\n00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:40.390\nBut is that really true when it\ncomes to these antivirus systems?\n\n423\n00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:43.250\nAre these free systems worth their wait,\nor should we just run out and\n\n424\n00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:45.460\ngrab some pay utility?\n\n425\n00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.185\n>> It really depends on your budget.\n\n426\n00:21:47.185 --> 00:21:49.530\nI'd tell you,\nthere are many free ones out there.\n\n427\n00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:50.980\nThere are free ones that have been out,\n\n428\n00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:54.100\nHouseCall is one of them that's\nbeen out there for a while.\n\n429\n00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:57.979\nAVG has got some that are out\nthere that are very good.\n\n430\n00:21:57.979 --> 00:22:00.770\nDon't think that just because\nit's free that it's not gonna\n\n431\n00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:03.150\nprovide you the protection that you need.\n\n432\n00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:06.350\nA lot of times when you get trial,\nor not even trial memberships,\n\n433\n00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:09.230\nbut you get paid accounts, they give\nyou a lot of other bells and whistles,\n\n434\n00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:11.320\nlike tracking multiple devices, right?\n\n435\n00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:16.210\nNot just a single device, but\nI wanna be able to track whether I've got\n\n436\n00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:20.660\ninfections on all of the devices, mobile\ndevices and everything within my network.\n\n437\n00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:25.110\nSo don't think that just because it\nsays free that it's not gonna do\n\n438\n00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.970\nwhat you need it to do.\n\n439\n00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:28.480\nYou just really have to\npay attention to what the,\n\n440\n00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:33.520\nI keep wanting to say trial memberships,\nbut what the paid versions give you.\n\n441\n00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:37.620\nNow what if you have a virus and you can't\nuse something like HouseCall, right?\n\n442\n00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:39.570\nWell, there's another\none that I like to use.\n\n443\n00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:41.600\nAnd Dan,\nI know you like to use this one too.\n\n444\n00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.600\nAnd that one's called Malwarebytes,\nso let's go ahead and show you that.\n\n445\n00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:48.250\nI've actually got that,\nMalwarebytes is pulled down.\n\n446\n00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:52.560\nThis is good because I can put\nthis on a thumb drive if I want.\n\n447\n00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.690\nThis computer has no outbound\nInternet connection at all.\n\n448\n00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:58.170\nIt cannot call home, all right?\n\n449\n00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:01.760\nAnd remember, we're quarantining it,\nso we need that.\n\n450\n00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.772\nLet's go ahead, and guys, be very careful.\n\n451\n00:23:04.772 --> 00:23:07.062\nWe're gonna go ahead and\ninfect this machine here.\n\n452\n00:23:07.062 --> 00:23:10.380\nWe're gonna hit it with\na crypto locker virus.\n\n453\n00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:16.010\nAnd one of the things you really\njust be careful with is the fact\n\n454\n00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:21.040\nthat if you set these loose,\nknow what you're doing.\n\n455\n00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.610\nLike I said, I've disconnected everything.\n\n456\n00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:24.820\nIt doesn't have connectivity to my host.\n\n457\n00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:27.610\nI'm actually gonna do something\nthat you shouldn't do to set us up.\n\n458\n00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:29.210\nI'm gonna turn Windows Defender off,\n\n459\n00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:32.860\ncuz I want you to see how\nMalwarebytes will work.\n\n460\n00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:36.012\nAll right, so I'm infecting this\nmachine here, and again, notice,\n\n461\n00:23:36.012 --> 00:23:39.288\nDan, that I didn't really see\nanything in the background, right?\n\n462\n00:23:39.288 --> 00:23:42.160\nIt just says, okay, it's running.\n\n463\n00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:45.622\nAnd I get nothing,\nno sign of anything happening.\n\n464\n00:23:45.622 --> 00:23:48.585\nNow I'm installing Malwarebytes\nas we speak here, and\n\n465\n00:23:48.585 --> 00:23:50.660\nwe'll let it go through its process.\n\n466\n00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:52.525\nAnd that's the problem with\nsome of these viruses, right?\n\n467\n00:23:52.525 --> 00:23:54.729\nWe did get some signs of viruses,\n\n468\n00:23:54.729 --> 00:23:58.597\nWindows Defender let us know\nthat something was going on.\n\n469\n00:23:58.597 --> 00:24:02.138\nBut had Windows Defender not been on,\nI just turned it off.\n\n470\n00:24:02.138 --> 00:24:04.657\nI wouldn't be aware that\nany of this is going on.\n\n471\n00:24:04.657 --> 00:24:08.003\nNow the good thing about\nmalware bites is again,\n\n472\n00:24:08.003 --> 00:24:12.790\nwhen I download this executable right,\nI can put it on a thumb drive.\n\n473\n00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:15.190\nWe'll restart it later.\n\n474\n00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:17.160\nI tell you what, we'll go ahead and\n\n475\n00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.270\ndo a quick restart here,\nmight as well make it happy.\n\n476\n00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:24.340\nThe great thing about malware bites is,\nI can put it on a thumb drive.\n\n477\n00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:28.610\nAnd if I need to quarantine a device\nI can't go over the network right.\n\n478\n00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:32.800\nI can take that thumb drive and I can plug\nit into the laptop or the computer that's\n\n479\n00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:38.970\nin question and hopefully,\nit'll remediate that virus.\n\n480\n00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:41.640\nNow, we're gonna see\nit here as it reboots.\n\n481\n00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:42.380\nGive it a second.\n\n482\n00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:46.530\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and see if\nwe can't eliminate some malware here,\n\n483\n00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:48.450\ndo some remediation.\n\n484\n00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:50.320\n>> Now, Wes,\nwhen it comes to the crypto locker virus,\n\n485\n00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.940\nthis is a very particular nasty guy.\n\n486\n00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:57.147\nIt will remove malwarebytes and\nmicro systems and most anti-virus\n\n487\n00:24:57.147 --> 00:25:01.560\nsystems will remove it, but\nthey won't un-encrypt your drive, right?\n\n488\n00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:02.160\n>> Yes.\n\n489\n00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:07.090\n>> If you have a crypto locker type virus,\nyou can get it off your system, but\n\n490\n00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:10.110\nif it has encrypted the drive-\n>> Game over.\n\n491\n00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:14.098\n>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> Yeah,\ndefinitely game over on that one.\n\n492\n00:25:14.098 --> 00:25:16.980\nYou do have, and again that's\nwhy it's good to be proactive.\n\n493\n00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:21.860\nYou need to have real time scans\ngoing on at all times to make sure\n\n494\n00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:25.360\nthat your systems do\nmaintain a level of safety.\n\n495\n00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.760\nWe're gonna talk about it coming up.\n\n496\n00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:31.830\nOne of the biggest reasons you can get\nthese viruses is through not updating\n\n497\n00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:37.250\nyour machines, not having all of\nthe security defense in-depth in place.\n\n498\n00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:41.270\nAll right, so\nit looks like our machine is up and\n\n499\n00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:43.430\nrunning, and\nI'm gonna go a little bit further.\n\n500\n00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:47.905\nI'm actually gonna infect this with\na couple of different, and you know what?\n\n501\n00:25:47.905 --> 00:25:49.800\nMalwarebytes is doing its job.\n\n502\n00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:52.860\nSo, again you go back to that question,\nDan,\n\n503\n00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:55.375\nyou asked about free is free worth it?\n\n504\n00:25:55.375 --> 00:25:55.975\nYou know what?\n\n505\n00:25:55.975 --> 00:26:01.195\nThis one's built into the system and you\ncan see that it's doing its job even so\n\n506\n00:26:01.195 --> 00:26:05.065\nmuch so that it doesn't want to play\nnice with letting me break Windows.\n\n507\n00:26:05.065 --> 00:26:10.115\nYou can see look there it is just\ncatching all kinds of stuff.\n\n508\n00:26:10.115 --> 00:26:14.575\nBut what I really wanna do is I want\nyou guys to see how Malwarebytes can do\n\n509\n00:26:14.575 --> 00:26:19.160\nthis so that if you don't have\nInternet connection, or for\n\n510\n00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.340\nwhat ever reason, and this can happen.\n\n511\n00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:25.180\nWe were talking about this\nbefore we went on camera.\n\n512\n00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:27.450\nIs that even legitimate executables,\nright?\n\n513\n00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:30.300\nThe things that you want to run,\nthese viruses can shut down.\n\n514\n00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:33.930\nSo it's good to have something\nlike Malwarebytes ready to go.\n\n515\n00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:35.930\nAll right, so\nit looks like we've got Malwarebytes.\n\n516\n00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:38.270\nAnd I've got this strange Adobe connector.\n\n517\n00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:41.980\nI need to, apparently,\nupdate my Adobe Flash Player on this.\n\n518\n00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:43.980\nI don't have Adobe Flash Player on this.\n\n519\n00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.740\nThat's another telltale sign.\n\n520\n00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:49.820\nWhy is a piece of software that I don't\neven have installed trying to reach out\n\n521\n00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:51.520\nand contact the Internet update?\n\n522\n00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:52.560\nSo let's go ahead.\n\n523\n00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.210\nWe'll do a quick scan here.\n\n524\n00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:56.680\nAnd what it does is it does\nits preliminary scanning.\n\n525\n00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:00.120\nAnd now, once that's done,\nit goes straight in the memory.\n\n526\n00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.950\nAnd you could see it's gonna do,\nthe scan shouldn't be too long.\n\n527\n00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:05.700\nThe drive really isn't too big here.\n\n528\n00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:09.180\nAnd we're gonna see if it's\ngonna find this virus.\n\n529\n00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:13.650\nNow keep in mind that this virus, if you\nwill is inside of memory right now, and\n\n530\n00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:14.820\nit is running.\n\n531\n00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:16.400\nAnd I can see right now,\n\n532\n00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.990\nright away without connecting\noutbound to the Internet, right?\n\n533\n00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:22.800\nI don't have a definition\ndatabase that I can update.\n\n534\n00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:27.699\nThat Malwarebytes has found two\nfake invoice trojans that are on\n\n535\n00:27:27.699 --> 00:27:29.610\nthis machine right now.\n\n536\n00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:34.050\nNow we could let this thing keep running,\nall right, and it's\n\n537\n00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:37.969\nlet me know that it doesn't like, Windows\nDefender's like I'm the one that you want.\n\n538\n00:27:37.969 --> 00:27:39.560\n[LAUGH] Not this guy.\n\n539\n00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:43.500\nBut we can see that Malwarebytes has\ndone its job and we'll go ahead and\n\n540\n00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:47.940\nlet this run through and then through the\nmagic of TV time outs, we'll come back and\n\n541\n00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:51.670\nshow you guys how we can\neliminate these viruses.\n\n542\n00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:52.270\nAll right.\nSo\n\n543\n00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:54.960\nit looks like Malwarebytes\nhas finished its scan.\n\n544\n00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:55.620\nLet's see what it found.\n\n545\n00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:58.520\nOn our machine here we can see\nthat it's found a few things.\n\n546\n00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:01.110\nAnd you can see right there that HKU,\nright?\n\n547\n00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:04.030\nThat's your hotkey, or,\nexcuse me, HKUsers, right?\n\n548\n00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:05.980\nThat's a subtree to the registry.\n\n549\n00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:09.260\nAnd you can see that it found something\nway down there in the registry and\n\n550\n00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:12.220\nyou can see, look here,\nRootkit banking trojan.\n\n551\n00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:14.710\nSo it's done its job, right?\n\n552\n00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:17.270\nI would say it's made its money,\nbut it was free.\n\n553\n00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:18.910\nSo back to your question earlier, Dan.\n\n554\n00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:21.190\nYou said about these free utilities,\nyeah this one's free.\n\n555\n00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:24.630\nAnd I have used it a lot, and\nI know Dan's used it a lot too.\n\n556\n00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:28.160\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna choose Remove Selected, and\n\n557\n00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.840\nthen it says it's removing it.\n\n558\n00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:34.060\nIt's gotta clean this off so it's telling\nus hey, we're gonna generate a log for\n\n559\n00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:35.990\nyou so that if you need to\nreview that information,\n\n560\n00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:39.040\nwhich you should,\nyou'll have that available.\n\n561\n00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:42.990\nNow while that's restarting, I did go\nahead and pull up HouseCall, I want to\n\n562\n00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:46.080\nshow you guys how to install that,\ncuz it's a really good program to run.\n\n563\n00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.920\nNow, this machine isn't infected.\n\n564\n00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:52.360\nGuys, I certainly don't want to attach\nan infected machine to our network.\n\n565\n00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:54.860\nI'm sure Dan would absolutely love that.\n\n566\n00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:55.670\nWe're gonna go ahead.\n\n567\n00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:59.640\nWe're gonna run this and\nSmartScreen Filter is gonna do its job.\n\n568\n00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.350\nYou might say, wait a second Wes,\nyou just ran a piece of software and\n\n569\n00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:03.280\nyou didn't check it first?\n\n570\n00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:07.936\nWe've got something built into Windows\ncalled SmartScreen Filter and what it does\n\n571\n00:29:07.936 --> 00:29:12.207\nis it looks for applications that it's\naware of that are digitally signed.\n\n572\n00:29:12.207 --> 00:29:14.987\nAnd if it is digitally signed\nwe know that we're good.\n\n573\n00:29:14.987 --> 00:29:17.800\nAll right, now notice that\n\n574\n00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:20.950\nHouseCall again you could see it's\ndownloading components updates, right?\n\n575\n00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:23.930\nIt's gonna pull down\na definition database.\n\n576\n00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:26.480\nIt's gonna make sure that\neverything's up to date.\n\n577\n00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:30.020\nGonna make sure all the components within\nthe software itself is up to date.\n\n578\n00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:32.630\nAnd then we will probably\nhave here in a second\n\n579\n00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:37.800\na crazy end-user license agreement\nthat we're gonna have to accept.\n\n580\n00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:41.010\nAnd then,\nwhat we can do from here is we can.\n\n581\n00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:46.930\nFast forward this into the scanning part.\n\n582\n00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:49.490\nWe'll give it a second here,\nand there it is.\n\n583\n00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:50.150\nIt's trying to show up.\n\n584\n00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:52.218\nIt's talking a little bit a time here.\n\n585\n00:29:52.218 --> 00:29:56.790\nSo HouseCall's a really, really good\nthing that if want something free, right?\n\n586\n00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:59.810\nTheyâ€™ve got online scanners that\nare available too that you can use.\n\n587\n00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:03.420\nSo for instance if I just wanna do\na quick scan of common locations,\n\n588\n00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:05.080\nI don't have to install anything locally.\n\n589\n00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:09.610\nThis one allows you to\ninstall it minimalistically,\n\n590\n00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:11.520\nif you will, locally on the machine.\n\n591\n00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:14.570\nBecause every time you run HouseCall\nyou're gonna have to connect\n\n592\n00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:15.480\noutbound to the Internet.\n\n593\n00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:16.970\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n594\n00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:19.990\nHere's that End User License Agreement\nthat comes up.\n\n595\n00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:22.440\nAnd we're gonna choose Next, all right.\n\n596\n00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:25.550\nAnd you do have some basic settings that\nyou can do, for instance I can get in here\n\n597\n00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:28.750\nand I can modify the settings, I can do\na full scan or I can do a custom scan.\n\n598\n00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:31.620\nSo for instance, maybe Dan comes to me and\nsays Wes, I've got a thumb drive,\n\n599\n00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:34.250\nI think it might have some viruses on it,\nright?\n\n600\n00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:37.140\nWell he might just say, so I formatted it.\n\n601\n00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:39.570\nWell, maybe he wants a little\nbit of information on what\n\n602\n00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:41.530\nvirus might be on that thumb drive.\n\n603\n00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:44.800\nWell I could also plug in a thumb drive\nif I want and customize the scan.\n\n604\n00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:49.620\nWe're just gonna go ahead and we'll\nleave it with just a basic scan here.\n\n605\n00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:52.300\nYour log settings, again,\nif it does find stuff,\n\n606\n00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:55.060\nit's found here, right here in HouseCall.\n\n607\n00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:57.860\nGo ahead and go back, and\nwe're gonna do a scan.\n\n608\n00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:00.070\nNow you guys have seen this before.\n\n609\n00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:01.870\nIt's gonna run through,\nit's gonna do its scan.\n\n610\n00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:03.040\nIt's gonna check outbound.\n\n611\n00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.020\nIt's got its database.\n\n612\n00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:04.940\nIt can communicate.\n\n613\n00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:08.470\nAnd one of the things that good about\nHouseCall is it stays up to date.\n\n614\n00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:13.560\nAgain, Trend Micro is constantly updating\nlike all the major manufacturers or\n\n615\n00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:14.510\nvendors are out there.\n\n616\n00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:17.840\nBut this isn't something like\nMBAM where you could have and\n\n617\n00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:20.940\nmostly likely do have an out of\ndate definition database and\n\n618\n00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:23.180\nthat's one of the good\nthings about HouseCall.\n\n619\n00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:26.460\nSo Dan we got a couple of other products\nthat I might want to mention here,\n\n620\n00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:29.960\nif you're running Windows 7 you can always\nget Microsoft security essentials keep\n\n621\n00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:32.350\nthat in mind that is always an option.\n\n622\n00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:37.850\nThe other thing that you can get to, we've\nmentioned ABG, these are free out there.\n\n623\n00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:42.710\nWhatever remediation,\nany virus technology used,\n\n624\n00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:45.700\nthe big thing is to make sure you use it,\nright?\n\n625\n00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:46.980\n>> It's like a bullet proof vest.\n\n626\n00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:49.590\n[LAUGH] You go out as a police officer.\n\n627\n00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:50.733\nYou're in probably in some danger.\n\n628\n00:31:50.733 --> 00:31:53.427\nYou get on the Internet, you have\nan element of danger that is out there.\n\n629\n00:31:53.427 --> 00:31:55.226\nYou need to take steps\nto protect yourself.\n\n630\n00:31:55.226 --> 00:31:57.907\nAnd all you gonna do is put on\nsome sort of bullet proof vest.\n\n631\n00:31:57.907 --> 00:32:00.010\nThat is our antivirus systems.\n\n632\n00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:04.840\nSo find one that you like that's easy for\nyou to work, and that you've learned and\n\n633\n00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.460\nit works for you.\n\n634\n00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:10.000\nLearn it, use it, right, turn it on,\nkeep it up to date, things of that nature.\n\n635\n00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.300\nAnd we're gonna hit that topic\nquite heavily I'm sure, coming up.\n\n636\n00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:15.580\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n637\n00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:18.750\nOne of the last ones that I might\nwant to talk about real quick,\n\n638\n00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:23.070\nwe've talked about, do you have\nconnection to the Internet, right?\n\n639\n00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:26.990\nIf you do, and you don't need to\nquarantine it to where you have don't\n\n640\n00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:30.450\nany internet connection, you can use\nsomething like House Call, right?\n\n641\n00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:33.810\nYou have stuff that is built in to\nthe machine that you can use as well.\n\n642\n00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:38.020\nWe've seen things like, for instance,\nWindows Defender, again, little bit older.\n\n643\n00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:39.230\nIf you've got Windows 7 Box,\n\n644\n00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:42.640\nyou can use something like\nMicrosoft Security Essentials.\n\n645\n00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.610\nIf you're doing your updates,\nyou should have the MRT in there.\n\n646\n00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:46.870\nBut what if it's so\n\n647\n00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:50.840\nsevere, right, that the moment you\nturn the computer on it's locked down.\n\n648\n00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:51.790\nYou can't do anything, right?\n\n649\n00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:54.010\nThey got a lot of technologies\nout there like ELAM,\n\n650\n00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:57.450\nthe Early Launch Anti-Malware Service\nthat checks system drivers.\n\n651\n00:32:57.450 --> 00:32:59.580\nBut what happens if stuff gets past that?\n\n652\n00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:01.020\nIt is possible.\n\n653\n00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:01.640\nLet me show you here,\n\n654\n00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:05.260\nyou could use something like this\nKaspersky's Rescue Disk, right?\n\n655\n00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:08.470\nAnd you can go ahead and\naccept the EULA here.\n\n656\n00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:11.410\nAnd what this does is I put\nit on a thumb drive, right?\n\n657\n00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:13.420\nAnd the computer isn't going,\n\n658\n00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:16.350\nthe hard drive in the computer\nisn't gonna be online, right?\n\n659\n00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:18.760\nThis is gonna be an offline mitigation.\n\n660\n00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:21.640\nAnd it's not offline just\nfrom a network's standpoint,\n\n661\n00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:23.790\nit's offline from a hard\ndrive standpoint too.\n\n662\n00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:25.670\nBecause I don't want that\nhard drive booting up.\n\n663\n00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:28.160\nSo this is more of like\na pre-installation environment.\n\n664\n00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:33.120\nWindows Defender Offline has this\nKasperky's, got their rescue disk here.\n\n665\n00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:36.870\nAnd what gives me the ability to\ndo is plug this into a machine,\n\n666\n00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:39.360\nboot directly to the USB drive.\n\n667\n00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:44.420\nYou could use an optical disk if you\nwanted to, boot to the optical disk.\n\n668\n00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:46.070\nAnd notice what I have here.\n\n669\n00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:51.060\nI have a very small footprint Linux\ndistro, like a Linux Live CD.\n\n670\n00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:55.130\nAnd it's not running from the local hard\ndrive, and it gives me the ability, and\n\n671\n00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:57.330\nthis is what I really like about this one,\nDan.\n\n672\n00:33:57.330 --> 00:34:01.240\nNotice that it gives me the ability\nto look at disk boot sectors too.\n\n673\n00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:05.990\nAll right, boot loader viruses are very\nhard sometimes to get rid off.\n\n674\n00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.629\nAnd in fact,\n\n675\n00:34:06.629 --> 00:34:10.584\nthey like to inject rootkits down in the\nlowest portion of the operating system,\n\n676\n00:34:10.584 --> 00:34:14.440\nbecause they boot up, and the any virus\nsoftware's not even initiated yet.\n\n677\n00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:18.880\nSo it starts to do its job before\nyour protection even kicks in.\n\n678\n00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:22.270\nSo this is a good thing that you\ncan run this against the hard drive\n\n679\n00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:25.510\nwhen in it's not on or\nwhen it's not initiated.\n\n680\n00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:29.520\nAnd it knows where to check, knows to\nlook down into the registry as well,\n\n681\n00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.030\njust like we've seen Malwarebytes do it.\n\n682\n00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:34.130\nBut from this standpoint,\nthe hard drive's not even running, and\n\n683\n00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:38.050\nthat might be one of your escalated\nmitigation techniques, right?\n\n684\n00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:41.960\nIt could be so severe you can't\neven turn the computer on.\n\n685\n00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:45.030\nSo it's a great thing to have,\nit runs in RAM.\n\n686\n00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:46.740\nThe next time I reboot this computer,\n\n687\n00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:51.010\nit's gone, provided I don't the USB thumb\ndrive still in the machine, it's gone.\n\n688\n00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:53.190\nAnd then hopefully we can\nboot our machine up, and\n\n689\n00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:55.470\nfrom there,\nproblem is hopefully mitigated.\n\n690\n00:34:55.470 --> 00:34:58.490\n>> All right, well, Wes,\nobviously you gave us some great tips and\n\n691\n00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:03.210\ntricks on how to either remediate our\nmachine if it does get infected, and how\n\n692\n00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:06.086\nto keep ourselves out of the weeds while\nactually throwing on that vest, right?\n\n693\n00:35:06.086 --> 00:35:08.730\nPut that bulletproof vest on,\ndon't let it sit in the corner.\n\n694\n00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:10.750\nIt's out there, there are free ones.\n\n695\n00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:13.464\nAll you have to do is download and\ninstall and run it,\n\n696\n00:35:13.464 --> 00:35:15.820\nand you're gonna have at\nleast some level protection.\n\n697\n00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:17.770\nAnd Wes,\nyou've done a great job of showing us.\n\n698\n00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:18.320\n>> Thanks.\n\n699\n00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.790\n>> Some of the symptoms,\nif our computer does get infected,\n\n700\n00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:24.810\nhow to we know that happens, and\nthen what to do if that is the case.\n\n701\n00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:26.880\nThanks for stopping by and\nexplaining it for us, Wes.\n\n702\n00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:30.100\nThank you guys for watching, we're gonna\ngo ahead and sign off for ITproTV.\n\n703\n00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:31.900\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n704\n00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:33.555\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan,\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n705\n00:35:33.555 --> 00:35:42.370\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
