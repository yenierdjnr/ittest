00:00:11.707\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:11.707 --> 00:00:13.193\nI'm here with Don Pezet today.\n\n5\n00:00:13.193 --> 00:00:14.410\nHow you doing, Don?\n\n6\n00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:15.020\n>> I am doing great.\n\n7\n00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.810\nHow about yourself, Daniel?\n\n8\n00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.695\n>> I can't complain but\nsometimes I still do.\n\n9\n00:00:17.695 --> 00:00:20.610\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well, you can complain all you want.\n\n10\n00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.580\nBut nobody's gonna listen.\n\n11\n00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.600\n>> Right.\n>> So, [SOUND] what do we got on our\n\n12\n00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.410\nagenda today, Daniel?\n\n13\n00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.356\n>> Today we are going to be looking\nat end-to-end encryption, and\n\n14\n00:00:27.356 --> 00:00:30.957\nwhy we would want to do that,\nand all the goodness thereof.\n\n15\n00:00:30.957 --> 00:00:34.000\nSo Don, what is encryption actually?\n\n16\n00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.540\n>> Yeah, you know this is something that's\nreally creeping up in the news a lot\n\n17\n00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.570\nlately, that people are starting\nto recognize that you can't\n\n18\n00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.210\ntrust the networks that we use.\n\n19\n00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.020\nYou really never could, just people\nare kind of realizing this now.\n\n20\n00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.120\nSo we need something to help us put\nthat trust back into our networks,\n\n21\n00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.120\nand encryption is what does it, right.\n\n22\n00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.550\nEncryption, at its heart if we just kind\nof break it down to its basic function,\n\n23\n00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.230\nis any method we can use\nto secure our data so\n\n24\n00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.190\nthat nobody can read or tamper with it,\n\n25\n00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.100\nwithout us either being aware or\nwithout it even being possible at all.\n\n26\n00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.680\nSo some way to ensure that there's\nnobody sitting in between.\n\n27\n00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.490\nSo if I'm sitting here and\nI'm talking to you, Daniel.\n\n28\n00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.640\n>> Right.\n>> We're having a conversation.\n\n29\n00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.450\n>> Right.\n\n30\n00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.830\n>> Anybody in this room could\nhear the conversation, and\n\n31\n00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:16.790\nthey'd know what was going on.\n\n32\n00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.650\nSo what if we had a code?\n\n33\n00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.974\n>> What if I said, Daniel,\nthe black sparrow flies at night.\n\n34\n00:01:21.974 --> 00:01:22.900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well,\n\n35\n00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.690\nthat might not mean anything to anybody,\nbut\n\n36\n00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.752\nto us we might have a code that says hey,\nyou wanna grab pizza for lunch?\n\n37\n00:01:28.752 --> 00:01:30.160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It doesn't have to be\n\n38\n00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.100\nimportant data, right?\n\n39\n00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.920\n>> Exactly.\n\n40\n00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.720\n>> But that's a very basic\nform of encryption, and\n\n41\n00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.040\nemail is an area where\nthat's really needed.\n\n42\n00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.780\n>> Yeah, and email,\ncause it goes over the wire.\n\n43\n00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.870\nPeople can steal it, they can grab it.\n\n44\n00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.510\nAnd you want that data to be encrypted so\neven if they do steal and\n\n45\n00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.880\ngrab it, they are not gonna be able\nto see what they're looking at.\n\n46\n00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.360\nThey're just going to see a bunch\nof gibberish and skull duggery.\n\n47\n00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.034\n>> Yep.\n>> Skull duggery.\n\n48\n00:01:51.034 --> 00:01:52.760\n>> Yes [LAUGH]\n>> That's going to be our word of the day.\n\n49\n00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.790\nWe're gonna get t-shirts\nprinted with that one.\n\n50\n00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.052\nSo when we deal with things like\nencryption now, for those of you that have\n\n51\n00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:04.169\nwatched our security plus shows, or CISSP\nshows, we talk about the CIA triad, right.\n\n52\n00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:08.215\nThe confidentiality, integrity,\nand availability of security.\n\n53\n00:02:08.215 --> 00:02:10.145\nWhenever you deploy a security technology,\n\n54\n00:02:10.145 --> 00:02:13.020\nit should provide at least\none of those things.\n\n55\n00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.900\nWell, encrypting your email actually\nprovides two of the three things, so\n\n56\n00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.700\nthis is one of the better solutions.\n\n57\n00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.360\nThe first one is confidentiality, and\n\n58\n00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.810\nconfidentiality just says,\nif I send an email to somebody,\n\n59\n00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.350\nI want to ensure that only the recipient\nis able to read it, and nobody else.\n\n60\n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.960\nThe includes the email servers and\n\n61\n00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.380\nInternet service providers that\nare in between me and them.\n\n62\n00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.970\nThat's the servers that my company hosts,\nthe servers that their company hosts, and\n\n63\n00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.320\nanybody in between.\n\n64\n00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.995\nNobody should be able to read that email,\nexcept for the recipient.\n\n65\n00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:45.580\nAnd email encryption achieves that.\n\n66\n00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.260\n>> Awesome.\n\n67\n00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.150\nAnd the second part of that triad that\nDon was just talking about is integrity.\n\n68\n00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.990\nThat means that our data\nis exactly what we put up.\n\n69\n00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.080\nWe send out an email, that email\nreaches the other end and it is good,\n\n70\n00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.320\nwe know it is the exact same\nemail that I sent before.\n\n71\n00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.020\nIt hasn't been intercepted, modified\nin any kind of way, and you get it with\n\n72\n00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.600\nconfidence and you can open that email and\nknow that that's your data.\n\n73\n00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.150\n>> Yeah.\nAnd that's pretty important,\n\n74\n00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.170\ncuz it's easy to tamper with email.\n\n75\n00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.665\n>> Yeah, we don't want that to happen.\n\n76\n00:03:14.665 --> 00:03:16.870\n[LAUGH]\n>> Now, the third one is availability,\n\n77\n00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.190\nand encrypting your email doesn't really\nprovide availability there, right?\n\n78\n00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.880\nAvailability is ensuring that a service\nis functioning when you need it.\n\n79\n00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.980\nWell, that really comes\ndown to redundancy and\n\n80\n00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.710\nother technologies like that on\nthe mail servers, themselves.\n\n81\n00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.060\nSo we're not gonna get that one.\n\n82\n00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.710\n>> Yeah.\n>> We do get two of the others.\n\n83\n00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.580\nAnd that means that this is a great\nsecurity technology to deploy.\n\n84\n00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.350\nAll right?\n\n85\n00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.266\nDaniel, why do we even need to worry about\nencrypting our email in the first place?\n\n86\n00:03:40.266 --> 00:03:42.355\nIf I send an email to to you.\n\n87\n00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:43.841\n>> Yeah.\n>> You get it.\n\n88\n00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:45.502\nIt goes in your mailbox.\nIt doesn't go in anybody else's\n\n89\n00:03:45.502 --> 00:03:46.230\nmailbox, right?\n\n90\n00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.460\nSo why bother encrypting it?\n\n91\n00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.430\n>> Well,\nyou would think that that would be plenty.\n\n92\n00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.160\nThat's all you need.\n\n93\n00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.770\nThe server sends you an email.\n\n94\n00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.490\nWho cares about looking at your email?\n\n95\n00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.480\nWell there are certain situations where\nyou may want to keep that data secure.\n\n96\n00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.970\nIt may be private information.\n\n97\n00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.360\nIt could be Social Security cards,\nbirthdates, mother's maiden name,\n\n98\n00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.850\nyour favorite band, whatever the case may\nbe, you wanna keep something secured.\n\n99\n00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.540\nYou might work for a government agency,\ncould be in the military, you might work\n\n100\n00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.160\nfor an RND company where that research is\nintellectual property you don't want other\n\n101\n00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.160\npeople getting a hold of that RND and\nthen creating a competing product.\n\n102\n00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.300\nSo, that is the reason that we'd\nlike to encrypt our emails.\n\n103\n00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.580\n>> And the thing we have to remember\nis that the email infrastructures on\n\n104\n00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.950\nthe internet,\nit was developed over thirty years ago,\n\n105\n00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.920\nand it was a much\ndifferent world back then.\n\n106\n00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.260\nRight, networks were a lot safer and\nsimpler,\n\n107\n00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.770\nand people didn't worry\nabout security like they do.\n\n108\n00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.900\nSo all email transported on\nthe Internet is transported using\n\n109\n00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.790\na protocol called SMTP.\n\n110\n00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.000\nThe simple mail transport protocol.\n\n111\n00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.870\n>> And SMTP sends email in plain text.\n\n112\n00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.780\nIt doesn't do any encoding or\nencrypting by default.\n\n113\n00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.520\nIt can be set to do encoding,\nbut that's not encryption.\n\n114\n00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.452\nEncoding just means it makes it\nmore compact, so it's smaller, and\n\n115\n00:04:58.452 --> 00:04:59.166\nmore reliable.\n\n116\n00:04:59.166 --> 00:05:02.237\nBut anybody can decode if\nit's uuencoded or Base64 or\n\n117\n00:05:02.237 --> 00:05:04.274\nany of those crazy things out there.\n\n118\n00:05:04.274 --> 00:05:05.597\nIt's super easy to reverse those.\n\n119\n00:05:05.597 --> 00:05:11.360\nSo when you send an email, it's traveling\nacross the network in plain text.\n\n120\n00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.450\nThat means any email server and\nany network or Internet service provider,\n\n121\n00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.670\nanybody in between you and your\ndestination, they can capture that traffic\n\n122\n00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.230\nwith like a packet sniffer, and\nthey can read your emails right there,\n\n123\n00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.270\nwhile that data is in transit,\nit is in plain text.\n\n124\n00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.330\nCompounding that,\n\n125\n00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.980\nonce it gets to a server, most of our\nservers will store it in plain text.\n\n126\n00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:39.220\nIf you're using SendMail, or Microsoft\nExchange, or any of the various email\n\n127\n00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.780\nservers that are out there, the majority\nof them store the data in plain text.\n\n128\n00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.350\nSure it might be in a database, but\nit's not secured in that database.\n\n129\n00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.460\nSo the data can be accessed and\n\n130\n00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.460\npeople can read your email, whoever\nis an administrator for that server.\n\n131\n00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.060\nSo we need ways to ensure that\nwhen we throw an email out there.\n\n132\n00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.012\nThat it is secured end to end.\n\n133\n00:05:58.012 --> 00:05:59.150\nNow let's talk about that Daniel.\n\n134\n00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.502\n>> Yeah.\n>> Because as our data,\n\n135\n00:06:00.502 --> 00:06:04.427\nas our email moves across the Internet, it\npasses through a few different places like\n\n136\n00:06:04.427 --> 00:06:05.372\nservers-\n>> Right.\n\n137\n00:06:05.372 --> 00:06:08.463\n>> and clients and all that so, we have\nto think about all those different steps\n\n138\n00:06:08.463 --> 00:06:11.665\nalong the journey, which is where\nthe end-to-end term comes from, right?\n\n139\n00:06:11.665 --> 00:06:12.245\n>> That is correct.\n\n140\n00:06:12.245 --> 00:06:16.760\nSo what types of encryption do we have,\nDon?\n\n141\n00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.428\nI'm sure there are multiple\ntypes of encryption,\n\n142\n00:06:19.428 --> 00:06:23.595\nwe have server based encryption and\ndifferent other types of things like that.\n\n143\n00:06:23.595 --> 00:06:26.520\nGive us an overview of what\nkind of encryption we have.\n\n144\n00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.146\n>> All right so, when you talk about\nencryption it may be something that you\n\n145\n00:06:30.146 --> 00:06:34.136\nhave to provide, it may be something\nthat you're service provider provides.\n\n146\n00:06:34.136 --> 00:06:35.738\nI guess that's why they\ncall it providers right?\n\n147\n00:06:35.738 --> 00:06:37.178\n>> [LAUGH] Providers.\n>> So they might do it.\n\n148\n00:06:37.178 --> 00:06:39.850\nAnd so you'll hear about people say like,\noh yeah,\n\n149\n00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.420\nour email server stores all of your\nemails fully encrypted, right.\n\n150\n00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.080\nWell, what does that do for you?\n\n151\n00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.270\nWell, what they're doing is\nwhat's called data at rest.\n\n152\n00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:52.247\nWhile your data is stored in their\nmailbox server, it's encrypted, right.\n\n153\n00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.990\nBut when they send the email along,\nwhen they forward it to somebody else,\n\n154\n00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.100\nwhoever the destination\nis it's gotta use SMTP.\n\n155\n00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.980\nAnd it's gotta be\nunencrypted at that point.\n\n156\n00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.890\nSo the email might be stored\nat rest encrypted, but\n\n157\n00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:09.160\nthat server based encryption does\nnot help you within transit.\n\n158\n00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.690\nAnd in transit's where your\ndata's really at risk.\n\n159\n00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.065\nAnd that's that next solution is,\n\n160\n00:07:13.065 --> 00:07:17.420\nis your service provider might say well\nwe secure your email in transit too.\n\n161\n00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:22.650\nThey might use SSL or TLS, technologies\nlike that coupled with SMTP to\n\n162\n00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.380\nencrypt the data as it moves\nfrom server to server.\n\n163\n00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:29.390\nBut the problem there is they only\ncontrol security from their server\n\n164\n00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:30.820\nto the next hop.\n\n165\n00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:34.185\nIf you have to pass through more than one\nserver, they don't have control over that.\n\n166\n00:07:34.185 --> 00:07:38.910\nSMTP wasn't designed to handle that,\nand so the encryption technologies that\n\n167\n00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:41.080\nare tacked on to SMTP are exactly that,\nthey're tacked on.\n\n168\n00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.620\nThey're hacks that are just added and\nthey're not terribly effective.\n\n169\n00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:49.470\nSo you can't really guarantee, even when\nyou use a service like Google, right.\n\n170\n00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:54.030\nGmail, where they do SSL to the web based\nemail box, and then they do encryption on\n\n171\n00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:57.490\ntheir database on the back end,\nwell Google's got the keys for that.\n\n172\n00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:58.830\nYou're trusting them.\n\n173\n00:07:58.830 --> 00:07:59.700\nThey can read your emails.\n\n174\n00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.330\nThat's how they show the relevant\nads in your mailbox, right?\n\n175\n00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.260\nThey actively read your emails.\n\n176\n00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.320\nSo you're trusting\nsomebody else to do that.\n\n177\n00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.290\nAnd most of us, we want more, right?\n\n178\n00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:12.960\nWe want something where, we don't have\nto trust anybody but ourselves, right?\n\n179\n00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.592\nWhat was it, was it Ben Franklin who said\ntwo men can keep a secret if one is dead?\n\n180\n00:08:17.592 --> 00:08:19.190\nRight?\n>> [LAUGH] Yes, that's exactly right.\n\n181\n00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.810\n>> So that's how email should be, right?\n\n182\n00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.170\n>> That's exactly how email should be.\n\n183\n00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:27.940\nSo Don, is there a type of encryption\nthat we can use that would ensure\n\n184\n00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.280\nwhen it's static, when it's still.\n\n185\n00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.100\nAnd also in motion?\n\n186\n00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:32.760\n>> Absolutely.\n\n187\n00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:33.720\n>> Awesome.\n>> And\n\n188\n00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:38.550\nwhat we have to do, is we have to take\ncharge of the encryption ourself, right?\n\n189\n00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:40.220\nYou can't trust your\nemail service provider.\n\n190\n00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.890\nYou can't trust your Internet\nservice provider, your network.\n\n191\n00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:44.720\nYou can't trust any of that stuff.\n\n192\n00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.680\nCan trust yourself.\n\n193\n00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.362\n>> It pays to be paranoid\nin this business.\n\n194\n00:08:47.362 --> 00:08:48.990\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Sad, but true, right?\n\n195\n00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:49.560\n>> Yes, it is.\n\n196\n00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.795\n>> This is gonna be my quote episode.\n\n197\n00:08:50.795 --> 00:08:52.283\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It was Kurt Cobain who said,\n\n198\n00:08:52.283 --> 00:08:54.696\njust because you're paranoid\ndoesn't mean they're not after you.\n\n199\n00:08:54.696 --> 00:08:55.601\n>> Doesn't mean they're not following,\nyeah.\n\n200\n00:08:55.601 --> 00:08:57.110\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So, that's how this is.\n\n201\n00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:00.630\nWe need some kinda technology\nthat will do that, and\n\n202\n00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:04.240\nthat's what this tech\nskills series is all about.\n\n203\n00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.010\nWe're gonna highlight, or\n\n204\n00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:05.870\nDaniel's gonna highlight,\n>> Yeah.\n\n205\n00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:08.390\n>> Several of the different\ntechnologies out there that we can use.\n\n206\n00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:10.630\nWhere we control the encryption.\n\n207\n00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:14.000\nNow it's encrypted even before\nit gets to the mail server.\n\n208\n00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.440\nAnd even before it crosses the Internet,\nit's encrypted.\n\n209\n00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.120\nSo we get end-to-end encryption.\n\n210\n00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.140\nIt's encrypted from the point\nthat it leaves your machine to\n\n211\n00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:22.800\nthe point that the recipient reads it.\n\n212\n00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.750\nAnd everybody in between is\nnot able to access that data.\n\n213\n00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:26.460\n>> Yes sir.\n\n214\n00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:31.660\nAnd the type of encryption that we're\ngonna be using to cover that is PGP,\n\n215\n00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:35.530\nwhich has been the standard encryption for\nquite a while now.\n\n216\n00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:36.200\n>> A long time.\n\n217\n00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:36.830\n>> A long time.\n\n218\n00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:40.600\nIt started off as an open source product,\nthen it got bought and\n\n219\n00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:41.710\nbecame a closed source product.\n\n220\n00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:46.055\nAnd the guy that actually created\nthe PGP encryption algorithm,\n\n221\n00:09:46.055 --> 00:09:49.940\ncreated the new open source\nusing the same basic idea.\n\n222\n00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.640\nAnd that is freely available to all of us,\n\n223\n00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.030\nwhich is what we're gonna use\nto do that type of encryption.\n\n224\n00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.040\n>> So in this series we're gonna start\nout by showing that one right, OpenPGP.\n\n225\n00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.140\nThat's probably the best of\nthe solutions that we'll talk about.\n\n226\n00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:05.690\nAnd we'll get a chance to see that\nfrom Windows, as well as Linux,\n\n227\n00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:06.790\nas well as Mac OS.\n\n228\n00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:09.770\nRight, so seeing these different\nplatforms all use PGP,\n\n229\n00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:13.510\nand the cool part about it is,\nit's not tied to just email.\n\n230\n00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:15.736\nYou could actually encrypt\nanything you wanted,\n\n231\n00:10:15.736 --> 00:10:18.870\nfiles, whatever it is that you\nwanted to transmit, not just emails.\n\n232\n00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:20.400\n>> Yeah.\n>> So very versatile,\n\n233\n00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.850\nvery good technology, and\nreally the one we recommend.\n\n234\n00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:23.680\nBut it's not the only one, right?\n\n235\n00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.460\n>> It's not the only one.\n\n236\n00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:30.050\nThey also have S/MIME, which is kind of\nplugin for emailers or email clients.\n\n237\n00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:34.120\nAnd the last one would be,\njust third party solutions.\n\n238\n00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:38.510\nThere are web-based OpenPGP\nports that you can go in.\n\n239\n00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:40.250\nYou can put your file into it.\n\n240\n00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:43.530\nThey'll do all the work for you,\nand then you can send your file.\n\n241\n00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:46.270\nSo you don't have to install any software,\nrun any commands, or\n\n242\n00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:47.520\ndo any kind of thing like that.\n\n243\n00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.810\nThey take all the guesswork out of it.\n\n244\n00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:50.080\nThey just say send us your files,\n\n245\n00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.660\nwe'll encrypt them,\nbada bing bada boom you're good to go.\n\n246\n00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:55.340\n>> Yeah and those are the good solutions.\n\n247\n00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:59.400\nBut I don't recommend them,\nnot because they're bad, but because for\n\n248\n00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.600\nexample, S/MIME,\nit's very dependent on your email client.\n\n249\n00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.410\nSo if you use Microsoft Outlook or\nif you use ThunderBird or\n\n250\n00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:08.350\nwhatever, they have that\nS/MIME support built in.\n\n251\n00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:11.600\nBut if you use something else,\nit might not have that support, and\n\n252\n00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.000\nthat's a problem.\n\n253\n00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.520\nSame thing goes for\nthe third party solutions,\n\n254\n00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:19.205\nthe third party solutions usually\nonly work in one particular scenario.\n\n255\n00:11:19.205 --> 00:11:21.550\nSo, for example it might work\nwith your web based email,\n\n256\n00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:24.560\nbut not with a client\nrunning on your own machine.\n\n257\n00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.520\nSo they start to put these requirement on\nthere, and it makes them difficult to use.\n\n258\n00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:32.230\nVersus OpenPGP,\nwhich you can use pretty much anywhere.\n\n259\n00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:34.050\n>> Right.\n>> And your encrypting that data yourself.\n\n260\n00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:35.960\nSo there's some neat\ntechnologies out there.\n\n261\n00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.970\nWe just wanna make sure\nwe highlight them all.\n\n262\n00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:40.640\nAnd then you can chose which one's\nappropriate for your solution.\n\n263\n00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.740\n>> Awesome.\n\n264\n00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.020\nWell Don, I think that covers\n\n265\n00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:43.650\nour overview-\n>> Yeah.\n\n266\n00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:45.030\n>> of encryption, and PGP and\n\n267\n00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:48.179\nthe different types of encryption\nthat we're gonna be using.\n\n268\n00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:50.670\nAnything else to add?\n\n269\n00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:53.210\n>> That's about it, so\nlet's stop jabbering about it and\n\n270\n00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:54.340\njump into the technology.\n\n271\n00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.140\nSo we'll wrap this overview right here,\nbut stay tuned.\n\n272\n00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.550\nComing up next is actually\ngetting the stuff configured and\n\n273\n00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:00.800\nI think we're gonna start with Windows,\nright?\n\n274\n00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.050\n>> We're gonna start with Windows,\nmake it easy for the users out there.\n\n275\n00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:06.150\nI mean, Windows is the standard\noperating system on a lot of desktops,\n\n276\n00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:07.690\nso that's where we'll go first.\n\n277\n00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:08.721\n>> All right, so stay tuned.\n\n278\n00:12:08.721 --> 00:12:10.997\nWe'll be back with more email encryption.\n\n279\n00:12:10.997 -->
