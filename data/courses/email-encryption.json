00:00:11.707\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:11.707 --> 00:00:13.193\nI'm here with Don Pezet today.\n\n5\n00:00:13.193 --> 00:00:14.410\nHow you doing, Don?\n\n6\n00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:15.020\n>> I am doing great.\n\n7\n00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.810\nHow about yourself, Daniel?\n\n8\n00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.695\n>> I can't complain but\nsometimes I still do.\n\n9\n00:00:17.695 --> 00:00:20.610\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well, you can complain all you want.\n\n10\n00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.580\nBut nobody's gonna listen.\n\n11\n00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.600\n>> Right.\n>> So, [SOUND] what do we got on our\n\n12\n00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.410\nagenda today, Daniel?\n\n13\n00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.356\n>> Today we are going to be looking\nat end-to-end encryption, and\n\n14\n00:00:27.356 --> 00:00:30.957\nwhy we would want to do that,\nand all the goodness thereof.\n\n15\n00:00:30.957 --> 00:00:34.000\nSo Don, what is encryption actually?\n\n16\n00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.540\n>> Yeah, you know this is something that's\nreally creeping up in the news a lot\n\n17\n00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.570\nlately, that people are starting\nto recognize that you can't\n\n18\n00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.210\ntrust the networks that we use.\n\n19\n00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.020\nYou really never could, just people\nare kind of realizing this now.\n\n20\n00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.120\nSo we need something to help us put\nthat trust back into our networks,\n\n21\n00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.120\nand encryption is what does it, right.\n\n22\n00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.550\nEncryption, at its heart if we just kind\nof break it down to its basic function,\n\n23\n00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.230\nis any method we can use\nto secure our data so\n\n24\n00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.190\nthat nobody can read or tamper with it,\n\n25\n00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.100\nwithout us either being aware or\nwithout it even being possible at all.\n\n26\n00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.680\nSo some way to ensure that there's\nnobody sitting in between.\n\n27\n00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.490\nSo if I'm sitting here and\nI'm talking to you, Daniel.\n\n28\n00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.640\n>> Right.\n>> We're having a conversation.\n\n29\n00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.450\n>> Right.\n\n30\n00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.830\n>> Anybody in this room could\nhear the conversation, and\n\n31\n00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:16.790\nthey'd know what was going on.\n\n32\n00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.650\nSo what if we had a code?\n\n33\n00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.974\n>> What if I said, Daniel,\nthe black sparrow flies at night.\n\n34\n00:01:21.974 --> 00:01:22.900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well,\n\n35\n00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.690\nthat might not mean anything to anybody,\nbut\n\n36\n00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.752\nto us we might have a code that says hey,\nyou wanna grab pizza for lunch?\n\n37\n00:01:28.752 --> 00:01:30.160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It doesn't have to be\n\n38\n00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.100\nimportant data, right?\n\n39\n00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.920\n>> Exactly.\n\n40\n00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.720\n>> But that's a very basic\nform of encryption, and\n\n41\n00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.040\nemail is an area where\nthat's really needed.\n\n42\n00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.780\n>> Yeah, and email,\ncause it goes over the wire.\n\n43\n00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.870\nPeople can steal it, they can grab it.\n\n44\n00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.510\nAnd you want that data to be encrypted so\neven if they do steal and\n\n45\n00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.880\ngrab it, they are not gonna be able\nto see what they're looking at.\n\n46\n00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.360\nThey're just going to see a bunch\nof gibberish and skull duggery.\n\n47\n00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.034\n>> Yep.\n>> Skull duggery.\n\n48\n00:01:51.034 --> 00:01:52.760\n>> Yes [LAUGH]\n>> That's going to be our word of the day.\n\n49\n00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.790\nWe're gonna get t-shirts\nprinted with that one.\n\n50\n00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.052\nSo when we deal with things like\nencryption now, for those of you that have\n\n51\n00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:04.169\nwatched our security plus shows, or CISSP\nshows, we talk about the CIA triad, right.\n\n52\n00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:08.215\nThe confidentiality, integrity,\nand availability of security.\n\n53\n00:02:08.215 --> 00:02:10.145\nWhenever you deploy a security technology,\n\n54\n00:02:10.145 --> 00:02:13.020\nit should provide at least\none of those things.\n\n55\n00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.900\nWell, encrypting your email actually\nprovides two of the three things, so\n\n56\n00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.700\nthis is one of the better solutions.\n\n57\n00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.360\nThe first one is confidentiality, and\n\n58\n00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.810\nconfidentiality just says,\nif I send an email to somebody,\n\n59\n00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.350\nI want to ensure that only the recipient\nis able to read it, and nobody else.\n\n60\n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.960\nThe includes the email servers and\n\n61\n00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.380\nInternet service providers that\nare in between me and them.\n\n62\n00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.970\nThat's the servers that my company hosts,\nthe servers that their company hosts, and\n\n63\n00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.320\nanybody in between.\n\n64\n00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.995\nNobody should be able to read that email,\nexcept for the recipient.\n\n65\n00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:45.580\nAnd email encryption achieves that.\n\n66\n00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.260\n>> Awesome.\n\n67\n00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.150\nAnd the second part of that triad that\nDon was just talking about is integrity.\n\n68\n00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.990\nThat means that our data\nis exactly what we put up.\n\n69\n00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.080\nWe send out an email, that email\nreaches the other end and it is good,\n\n70\n00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.320\nwe know it is the exact same\nemail that I sent before.\n\n71\n00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.020\nIt hasn't been intercepted, modified\nin any kind of way, and you get it with\n\n72\n00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.600\nconfidence and you can open that email and\nknow that that's your data.\n\n73\n00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.150\n>> Yeah.\nAnd that's pretty important,\n\n74\n00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.170\ncuz it's easy to tamper with email.\n\n75\n00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.665\n>> Yeah, we don't want that to happen.\n\n76\n00:03:14.665 --> 00:03:16.870\n[LAUGH]\n>> Now, the third one is availability,\n\n77\n00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.190\nand encrypting your email doesn't really\nprovide availability there, right?\n\n78\n00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.880\nAvailability is ensuring that a service\nis functioning when you need it.\n\n79\n00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.980\nWell, that really comes\ndown to redundancy and\n\n80\n00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.710\nother technologies like that on\nthe mail servers, themselves.\n\n81\n00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.060\nSo we're not gonna get that one.\n\n82\n00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.710\n>> Yeah.\n>> We do get two of the others.\n\n83\n00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.580\nAnd that means that this is a great\nsecurity technology to deploy.\n\n84\n00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.350\nAll right?\n\n85\n00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.266\nDaniel, why do we even need to worry about\nencrypting our email in the first place?\n\n86\n00:03:40.266 --> 00:03:42.355\nIf I send an email to to you.\n\n87\n00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:43.841\n>> Yeah.\n>> You get it.\n\n88\n00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:45.502\nIt goes in your mailbox.\nIt doesn't go in anybody else's\n\n89\n00:03:45.502 --> 00:03:46.230\nmailbox, right?\n\n90\n00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.460\nSo why bother encrypting it?\n\n91\n00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.430\n>> Well,\nyou would think that that would be plenty.\n\n92\n00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.160\nThat's all you need.\n\n93\n00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.770\nThe server sends you an email.\n\n94\n00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.490\nWho cares about looking at your email?\n\n95\n00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.480\nWell there are certain situations where\nyou may want to keep that data secure.\n\n96\n00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.970\nIt may be private information.\n\n97\n00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.360\nIt could be Social Security cards,\nbirthdates, mother's maiden name,\n\n98\n00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.850\nyour favorite band, whatever the case may\nbe, you wanna keep something secured.\n\n99\n00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.540\nYou might work for a government agency,\ncould be in the military, you might work\n\n100\n00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.160\nfor an RND company where that research is\nintellectual property you don't want other\n\n101\n00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.160\npeople getting a hold of that RND and\nthen creating a competing product.\n\n102\n00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.300\nSo, that is the reason that we'd\nlike to encrypt our emails.\n\n103\n00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.580\n>> And the thing we have to remember\nis that the email infrastructures on\n\n104\n00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.950\nthe internet,\nit was developed over thirty years ago,\n\n105\n00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.920\nand it was a much\ndifferent world back then.\n\n106\n00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.260\nRight, networks were a lot safer and\nsimpler,\n\n107\n00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.770\nand people didn't worry\nabout security like they do.\n\n108\n00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.900\nSo all email transported on\nthe Internet is transported using\n\n109\n00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.790\na protocol called SMTP.\n\n110\n00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.000\nThe simple mail transport protocol.\n\n111\n00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.870\n>> And SMTP sends email in plain text.\n\n112\n00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.780\nIt doesn't do any encoding or\nencrypting by default.\n\n113\n00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.520\nIt can be set to do encoding,\nbut that's not encryption.\n\n114\n00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.452\nEncoding just means it makes it\nmore compact, so it's smaller, and\n\n115\n00:04:58.452 --> 00:04:59.166\nmore reliable.\n\n116\n00:04:59.166 --> 00:05:02.237\nBut anybody can decode if\nit's uuencoded or Base64 or\n\n117\n00:05:02.237 --> 00:05:04.274\nany of those crazy things out there.\n\n118\n00:05:04.274 --> 00:05:05.597\nIt's super easy to reverse those.\n\n119\n00:05:05.597 --> 00:05:11.360\nSo when you send an email, it's traveling\nacross the network in plain text.\n\n120\n00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.450\nThat means any email server and\nany network or Internet service provider,\n\n121\n00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.670\nanybody in between you and your\ndestination, they can capture that traffic\n\n122\n00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.230\nwith like a packet sniffer, and\nthey can read your emails right there,\n\n123\n00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.270\nwhile that data is in transit,\nit is in plain text.\n\n124\n00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.330\nCompounding that,\n\n125\n00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.980\nonce it gets to a server, most of our\nservers will store it in plain text.\n\n126\n00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:39.220\nIf you're using SendMail, or Microsoft\nExchange, or any of the various email\n\n127\n00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.780\nservers that are out there, the majority\nof them store the data in plain text.\n\n128\n00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.350\nSure it might be in a database, but\nit's not secured in that database.\n\n129\n00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.460\nSo the data can be accessed and\n\n130\n00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.460\npeople can read your email, whoever\nis an administrator for that server.\n\n131\n00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.060\nSo we need ways to ensure that\nwhen we throw an email out there.\n\n132\n00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.012\nThat it is secured end to end.\n\n133\n00:05:58.012 --> 00:05:59.150\nNow let's talk about that Daniel.\n\n134\n00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.502\n>> Yeah.\n>> Because as our data,\n\n135\n00:06:00.502 --> 00:06:04.427\nas our email moves across the Internet, it\npasses through a few different places like\n\n136\n00:06:04.427 --> 00:06:05.372\nservers-\n>> Right.\n\n137\n00:06:05.372 --> 00:06:08.463\n>> and clients and all that so, we have\nto think about all those different steps\n\n138\n00:06:08.463 --> 00:06:11.665\nalong the journey, which is where\nthe end-to-end term comes from, right?\n\n139\n00:06:11.665 --> 00:06:12.245\n>> That is correct.\n\n140\n00:06:12.245 --> 00:06:16.760\nSo what types of encryption do we have,\nDon?\n\n141\n00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.428\nI'm sure there are multiple\ntypes of encryption,\n\n142\n00:06:19.428 --> 00:06:23.595\nwe have server based encryption and\ndifferent other types of things like that.\n\n143\n00:06:23.595 --> 00:06:26.520\nGive us an overview of what\nkind of encryption we have.\n\n144\n00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.146\n>> All right so, when you talk about\nencryption it may be something that you\n\n145\n00:06:30.146 --> 00:06:34.136\nhave to provide, it may be something\nthat you're service provider provides.\n\n146\n00:06:34.136 --> 00:06:35.738\nI guess that's why they\ncall it providers right?\n\n147\n00:06:35.738 --> 00:06:37.178\n>> [LAUGH] Providers.\n>> So they might do it.\n\n148\n00:06:37.178 --> 00:06:39.850\nAnd so you'll hear about people say like,\noh yeah,\n\n149\n00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.420\nour email server stores all of your\nemails fully encrypted, right.\n\n150\n00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.080\nWell, what does that do for you?\n\n151\n00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.270\nWell, what they're doing is\nwhat's called data at rest.\n\n152\n00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:52.247\nWhile your data is stored in their\nmailbox server, it's encrypted, right.\n\n153\n00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.990\nBut when they send the email along,\nwhen they forward it to somebody else,\n\n154\n00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.100\nwhoever the destination\nis it's gotta use SMTP.\n\n155\n00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.980\nAnd it's gotta be\nunencrypted at that point.\n\n156\n00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.890\nSo the email might be stored\nat rest encrypted, but\n\n157\n00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:09.160\nthat server based encryption does\nnot help you within transit.\n\n158\n00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.690\nAnd in transit's where your\ndata's really at risk.\n\n159\n00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.065\nAnd that's that next solution is,\n\n160\n00:07:13.065 --> 00:07:17.420\nis your service provider might say well\nwe secure your email in transit too.\n\n161\n00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:22.650\nThey might use SSL or TLS, technologies\nlike that coupled with SMTP to\n\n162\n00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.380\nencrypt the data as it moves\nfrom server to server.\n\n163\n00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:29.390\nBut the problem there is they only\ncontrol security from their server\n\n164\n00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:30.820\nto the next hop.\n\n165\n00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:34.185\nIf you have to pass through more than one\nserver, they don't have control over that.\n\n166\n00:07:34.185 --> 00:07:38.910\nSMTP wasn't designed to handle that,\nand so the encryption technologies that\n\n167\n00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:41.080\nare tacked on to SMTP are exactly that,\nthey're tacked on.\n\n168\n00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.620\nThey're hacks that are just added and\nthey're not terribly effective.\n\n169\n00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:49.470\nSo you can't really guarantee, even when\nyou use a service like Google, right.\n\n170\n00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:54.030\nGmail, where they do SSL to the web based\nemail box, and then they do encryption on\n\n171\n00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:57.490\ntheir database on the back end,\nwell Google's got the keys for that.\n\n172\n00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:58.830\nYou're trusting them.\n\n173\n00:07:58.830 --> 00:07:59.700\nThey can read your emails.\n\n174\n00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.330\nThat's how they show the relevant\nads in your mailbox, right?\n\n175\n00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.260\nThey actively read your emails.\n\n176\n00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.320\nSo you're trusting\nsomebody else to do that.\n\n177\n00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.290\nAnd most of us, we want more, right?\n\n178\n00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:12.960\nWe want something where, we don't have\nto trust anybody but ourselves, right?\n\n179\n00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.592\nWhat was it, was it Ben Franklin who said\ntwo men can keep a secret if one is dead?\n\n180\n00:08:17.592 --> 00:08:19.190\nRight?\n>> [LAUGH] Yes, that's exactly right.\n\n181\n00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.810\n>> So that's how email should be, right?\n\n182\n00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.170\n>> That's exactly how email should be.\n\n183\n00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:27.940\nSo Don, is there a type of encryption\nthat we can use that would ensure\n\n184\n00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.280\nwhen it's static, when it's still.\n\n185\n00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.100\nAnd also in motion?\n\n186\n00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:32.760\n>> Absolutely.\n\n187\n00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:33.720\n>> Awesome.\n>> And\n\n188\n00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:38.550\nwhat we have to do, is we have to take\ncharge of the encryption ourself, right?\n\n189\n00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:40.220\nYou can't trust your\nemail service provider.\n\n190\n00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.890\nYou can't trust your Internet\nservice provider, your network.\n\n191\n00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:44.720\nYou can't trust any of that stuff.\n\n192\n00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.680\nCan trust yourself.\n\n193\n00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.362\n>> It pays to be paranoid\nin this business.\n\n194\n00:08:47.362 --> 00:08:48.990\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Sad, but true, right?\n\n195\n00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:49.560\n>> Yes, it is.\n\n196\n00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.795\n>> This is gonna be my quote episode.\n\n197\n00:08:50.795 --> 00:08:52.283\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It was Kurt Cobain who said,\n\n198\n00:08:52.283 --> 00:08:54.696\njust because you're paranoid\ndoesn't mean they're not after you.\n\n199\n00:08:54.696 --> 00:08:55.601\n>> Doesn't mean they're not following,\nyeah.\n\n200\n00:08:55.601 --> 00:08:57.110\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So, that's how this is.\n\n201\n00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:00.630\nWe need some kinda technology\nthat will do that, and\n\n202\n00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:04.240\nthat's what this tech\nskills series is all about.\n\n203\n00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.010\nWe're gonna highlight, or\n\n204\n00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:05.870\nDaniel's gonna highlight,\n>> Yeah.\n\n205\n00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:08.390\n>> Several of the different\ntechnologies out there that we can use.\n\n206\n00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:10.630\nWhere we control the encryption.\n\n207\n00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:14.000\nNow it's encrypted even before\nit gets to the mail server.\n\n208\n00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.440\nAnd even before it crosses the Internet,\nit's encrypted.\n\n209\n00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.120\nSo we get end-to-end encryption.\n\n210\n00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.140\nIt's encrypted from the point\nthat it leaves your machine to\n\n211\n00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:22.800\nthe point that the recipient reads it.\n\n212\n00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.750\nAnd everybody in between is\nnot able to access that data.\n\n213\n00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:26.460\n>> Yes sir.\n\n214\n00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:31.660\nAnd the type of encryption that we're\ngonna be using to cover that is PGP,\n\n215\n00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:35.530\nwhich has been the standard encryption for\nquite a while now.\n\n216\n00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:36.200\n>> A long time.\n\n217\n00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:36.830\n>> A long time.\n\n218\n00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:40.600\nIt started off as an open source product,\nthen it got bought and\n\n219\n00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:41.710\nbecame a closed source product.\n\n220\n00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:46.055\nAnd the guy that actually created\nthe PGP encryption algorithm,\n\n221\n00:09:46.055 --> 00:09:49.940\ncreated the new open source\nusing the same basic idea.\n\n222\n00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.640\nAnd that is freely available to all of us,\n\n223\n00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.030\nwhich is what we're gonna use\nto do that type of encryption.\n\n224\n00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.040\n>> So in this series we're gonna start\nout by showing that one right, OpenPGP.\n\n225\n00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.140\nThat's probably the best of\nthe solutions that we'll talk about.\n\n226\n00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:05.690\nAnd we'll get a chance to see that\nfrom Windows, as well as Linux,\n\n227\n00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:06.790\nas well as Mac OS.\n\n228\n00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:09.770\nRight, so seeing these different\nplatforms all use PGP,\n\n229\n00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:13.510\nand the cool part about it is,\nit's not tied to just email.\n\n230\n00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:15.736\nYou could actually encrypt\nanything you wanted,\n\n231\n00:10:15.736 --> 00:10:18.870\nfiles, whatever it is that you\nwanted to transmit, not just emails.\n\n232\n00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:20.400\n>> Yeah.\n>> So very versatile,\n\n233\n00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.850\nvery good technology, and\nreally the one we recommend.\n\n234\n00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:23.680\nBut it's not the only one, right?\n\n235\n00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.460\n>> It's not the only one.\n\n236\n00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:30.050\nThey also have S/MIME, which is kind of\nplugin for emailers or email clients.\n\n237\n00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:34.120\nAnd the last one would be,\njust third party solutions.\n\n238\n00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:38.510\nThere are web-based OpenPGP\nports that you can go in.\n\n239\n00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:40.250\nYou can put your file into it.\n\n240\n00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:43.530\nThey'll do all the work for you,\nand then you can send your file.\n\n241\n00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:46.270\nSo you don't have to install any software,\nrun any commands, or\n\n242\n00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:47.520\ndo any kind of thing like that.\n\n243\n00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.810\nThey take all the guesswork out of it.\n\n244\n00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:50.080\nThey just say send us your files,\n\n245\n00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.660\nwe'll encrypt them,\nbada bing bada boom you're good to go.\n\n246\n00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:55.340\n>> Yeah and those are the good solutions.\n\n247\n00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:59.400\nBut I don't recommend them,\nnot because they're bad, but because for\n\n248\n00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.600\nexample, S/MIME,\nit's very dependent on your email client.\n\n249\n00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.410\nSo if you use Microsoft Outlook or\nif you use ThunderBird or\n\n250\n00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:08.350\nwhatever, they have that\nS/MIME support built in.\n\n251\n00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:11.600\nBut if you use something else,\nit might not have that support, and\n\n252\n00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.000\nthat's a problem.\n\n253\n00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.520\nSame thing goes for\nthe third party solutions,\n\n254\n00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:19.205\nthe third party solutions usually\nonly work in one particular scenario.\n\n255\n00:11:19.205 --> 00:11:21.550\nSo, for example it might work\nwith your web based email,\n\n256\n00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:24.560\nbut not with a client\nrunning on your own machine.\n\n257\n00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.520\nSo they start to put these requirement on\nthere, and it makes them difficult to use.\n\n258\n00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:32.230\nVersus OpenPGP,\nwhich you can use pretty much anywhere.\n\n259\n00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:34.050\n>> Right.\n>> And your encrypting that data yourself.\n\n260\n00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:35.960\nSo there's some neat\ntechnologies out there.\n\n261\n00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.970\nWe just wanna make sure\nwe highlight them all.\n\n262\n00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:40.640\nAnd then you can chose which one's\nappropriate for your solution.\n\n263\n00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.740\n>> Awesome.\n\n264\n00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.020\nWell Don, I think that covers\n\n265\n00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:43.650\nour overview-\n>> Yeah.\n\n266\n00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:45.030\n>> of encryption, and PGP and\n\n267\n00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:48.179\nthe different types of encryption\nthat we're gonna be using.\n\n268\n00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:50.670\nAnything else to add?\n\n269\n00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:53.210\n>> That's about it, so\nlet's stop jabbering about it and\n\n270\n00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:54.340\njump into the technology.\n\n271\n00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.140\nSo we'll wrap this overview right here,\nbut stay tuned.\n\n272\n00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.550\nComing up next is actually\ngetting the stuff configured and\n\n273\n00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:00.800\nI think we're gonna start with Windows,\nright?\n\n274\n00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.050\n>> We're gonna start with Windows,\nmake it easy for the users out there.\n\n275\n00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:06.150\nI mean, Windows is the standard\noperating system on a lot of desktops,\n\n276\n00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:07.690\nso that's where we'll go first.\n\n277\n00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:08.721\n>> All right, so stay tuned.\n\n278\n00:12:08.721 --> 00:12:10.997\nWe'll be back with more email encryption.\n\n279\n00:12:10.997 -->

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.128 --> 00:00:05.503\n[SOUND] In this episode we will be\n\n2\n00:00:05.503 --> 00:00:11.713\ndiscussing OpenPGP with Windows.\n\n3\n00:00:11.713 --> 00:00:14.115\nSo we were gonna dabble\na little bit in the dark arts.\n\n4\n00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:16.110\n[LAUGH] Don does that sound good to you?\n\n5\n00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.030\n>> That sounds like a plan.\n\n6\n00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.048\nThis is something that\na lot of people need.\n\n7\n00:00:19.048 --> 00:00:22.250\nIs they wanna encrypt data and send it to\nsomebody else and they can decrypt it, so\n\n8\n00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.920\nwe get that end to end security.\n\n9\n00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.261\nThe problem is Windows doesn't really\nhave a lot of built in software for\n\n10\n00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:30.502\nus to be able to do that unlike Linux or\nMac OS, but\n\n11\n00:00:30.502 --> 00:00:32.480\nthere's a lot of stuff that's built in.\n\n12\n00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.710\nHere, we've got to find the tools for it.\n\n13\n00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.484\nSo Daniel you've got\nan example worked out for\n\n14\n00:00:36.484 --> 00:00:39.710\nus to show how to get this going quick and\neasy, in between Windows machines.\n\n15\n00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.620\n>> That's right Don.\n\n16\n00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.583\nI've got everything ready to go.\n\n17\n00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:43.533\nWe're gonna install some software.\n\n18\n00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:46.493\nWe're gonna configure some software, and\nthen we're gonna get to decrypting and\n\n19\n00:00:46.493 --> 00:00:48.750\nencrypting and\nhaving a good old time doing that.\n\n20\n00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.870\nSo, if you guys are ready,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n21\n00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.720\njump into our lab and install the software\nthat we need to get this working.\n\n22\n00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:04.060\nSo if you look on my computer,\nI'm gonna go to the gpg4wind.org website.\n\n23\n00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.370\nNow, you can find the download\nright off their main page.\n\n24\n00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.160\nThey make it super easy to find.\n\n25\n00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.875\nI've already downloaded the software.\n\n26\n00:01:10.875 --> 00:01:14.165\nIt's on my computer waiting\nto be installed, but\n\n27\n00:01:14.165 --> 00:01:16.425\nthis is the website you'd have\nto go to to find the software.\n\n28\n00:01:16.425 --> 00:01:21.035\nI found the software to be very user\nfriendly, very easy, very intuitive.\n\n29\n00:01:21.035 --> 00:01:25.446\nI liked it a lot out of all the different\nopen GPG software that I found.\n\n30\n00:01:25.446 --> 00:01:28.124\n>> And you know, that's a great point\nDaniel, is that there's actually a ton of\n\n31\n00:01:28.124 --> 00:01:30.045\ndifferent software out there\nthat somebody could use.\n\n32\n00:01:30.045 --> 00:01:31.595\nThey don't have to use GPG for\n\n33\n00:01:31.595 --> 00:01:35.067\nWin, but we were trying to find\nsomething that was easy to use, and\n\n34\n00:01:35.067 --> 00:01:39.280\na little less importantly, but\nstill somewhat important, free, right?\n\n35\n00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.390\n>> Yeah.\n>> So this is\n\n36\n00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.800\nfree software that can handle\nthe encryption and decryption,\n\n37\n00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.880\nand we're gonna need some other\nsoftware tacked onto it so\n\n38\n00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.330\nsome of that stuff you paid for is nice\ncuz it gives you an all in one solution.\n\n39\n00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.780\n>> But this will be that first pack\nbecause it handles the encryption and\n\n40\n00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.480\ndecryption and it is free.\n\n41\n00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.429\n>> Yes free, we like free,\nit's my favorite form of payment.\n\n42\n00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:59.831\nFree 99 as they like to say.\n\n43\n00:01:59.831 --> 00:02:00.940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So as you were,\n\n44\n00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.830\nyou would download in this, and I'm sure\nthat you guys know how to do that so\n\n45\n00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.380\nwon't bore you with that.\n\n46\n00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.990\nSo well just go ahead, and\nI've got the, in my Downloads.\n\n47\n00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.030\nI'm Mister James Bond today cuz we're\ndoing a little espionage type work here,\n\n48\n00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.820\none of my favorite kind\nof clandestine art.\n\n49\n00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.660\nI'll go to my Downloads, and\nthere is the installation package.\n\n50\n00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.340\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\njust double-click to install.\n\n51\n00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.050\nI get the UAC prompt, and\njust say Yes to that.\n\n52\n00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.930\nChoose my language, okay.\n\n53\n00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.860\nBasically run through your next there.\n\n54\n00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.040\nThis is the license agreement.\n\n55\n00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.340\nIf you feel so inclined,\nI would run through it, just check it out.\n\n56\n00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.512\n>> Because we all read those,\nvery important.\n\n57\n00:02:40.512 --> 00:02:41.197\n>> I do, every time.\n\n58\n00:02:41.197 --> 00:02:45.060\nI've read every license\nagreement I've ever come across.\n\n59\n00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.204\nAnd if you believe that,\nI also have a bridge to sell you.\n\n60\n00:02:47.204 --> 00:02:48.646\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n61\n00:02:48.646 --> 00:02:49.958\n>> You are then greeted with some\n\n62\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:50.910\ncomponent options.\n\n63\n00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.565\nThis is kind of important, there are some\nother pieces of this software that can be\n\n64\n00:02:55.565 --> 00:02:57.189\ninstalled if you need them.\n\n65\n00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:00.173\nOne of them that is very\nimportant is this Clause email.\n\n66\n00:03:00.173 --> 00:03:05.270\nThat is just a basic email client that\nhas PGP/GPG integration built into it,\n\n67\n00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.673\nso you can use that and if you don't\nhave Thunderbird or Outlook, or\n\n68\n00:03:09.673 --> 00:03:11.390\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n69\n00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.120\nIt also has this GPA software, which is\n\n70\n00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.040\nvery similar to the Cleopatra software\nthat we're going to take a look at.\n\n71\n00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.190\nThey both basically do\nthe exact same thing,\n\n72\n00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.700\nI just prefer the Cleopatra over the GPA.\n\n73\n00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.980\nYou can install that at this\npoint if you'd like and\n\n74\n00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.900\nplay with it and have a good time.\n\n75\n00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.370\n>> Yeah, and what that software\ndoes is this what's gonna actually\n\n76\n00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.380\ngenerate the keys that we'll use for\nencryption.\n\n77\n00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.330\nThe cool thing about GPG for Win is we're\ntalking about this in terms email, but\n\n78\n00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:39.720\nyou could really use this for\n\n79\n00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.175\nanything, any type of secure file\nencryption that you wanna provide.\n\n80\n00:03:43.175 --> 00:03:45.290\nSo, if you were gonna be\ndoing FTP transfers or\n\n81\n00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.590\nsomething, you could use GPG for Win to\nencrypt it and as long as somebody had,\n\n82\n00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.550\nif it was encrypted to their private\nkey they would be able to decrypt it.\n\n83\n00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.911\nBut you need something to\ndo that key management, and\n\n84\n00:03:56.911 --> 00:03:59.389\nthat's what Cleopatra does and\nthat's what GPA does.\n\n85\n00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:03.346\nWe're gonna choose Cleopatra, and again,\nfeel free to use choose software you want,\n\n86\n00:04:03.346 --> 00:04:06.249\nbut we want it to be easy and\nuser-friendly, Cleopatra is out.\n\n87\n00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:10.165\n>> Yeah, Cleopatra definitely\nthe very easy software.\n\n88\n00:04:10.165 --> 00:04:11.738\nIt'll get you going very quickly.\n\n89\n00:04:11.738 --> 00:04:15.900\nSo I'm gonna get back to my computer,\nand I'm gonna click\n\n90\n00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.769\nnext because I'm just gonna stick with\nthe defaults, and it chooses our path.\n\n91\n00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.920\nAnd then I can also at this point put it\non the Desktop of the Quick Launch Bar.\n\n92\n00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.220\nI really do like a Quick Launch Bar,\nso I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n93\n00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.870\ndo that at this point.\n\n94\n00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.145\n>> Does that even work anymore?\n\n95\n00:04:29.145 --> 00:04:31.790\n>> [LAUGH] Well I guess it's the Task bar.\n\n96\n00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.030\nLet's click Install.\n\n97\n00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.070\n>> I used to always use that in Windows XP\nand stuff and then in Vista and 7 it was\n\n98\n00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.180\nlike that option never worked anymore-\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n99\n00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.840\n>> but whatever.\n\n100\n00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.300\nYou create icons all over the place.\n\n101\n00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.865\n>> That's right.\n\n102\n00:04:42.865 --> 00:04:45.340\n[LAUGH]\n>> Now while Daniel's doing that on his\n\n103\n00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.620\ncomputer, I'm actually doing\nthe same thing on mine.\n\n104\n00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.860\nSo I've got GPG for Win installed, and\n\n105\n00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.190\nI've got Cleopatra installed just like\nhe does, cuz I wanna be like Daniel.\n\n106\n00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.710\n>> You wanna be like me.\n\n107\n00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.415\nThat's a good way to be.\n\n108\n00:04:58.415 --> 00:04:59.700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n109\n00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.830\nnow I'm at the finish screen.\n\n110\n00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.330\nIt has a readme file.\n\n111\n00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.710\nI always encourage everybody that\ninstalls software, read the readme files.\n\n112\n00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.160\nThey are very helpful.\n\n113\n00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.895\nDo not just go oh,\nI'll look at that later.\n\n114\n00:05:09.895 --> 00:05:12.020\nThat should always be\nthe first thing that you do.\n\n115\n00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.330\nI've already read the Read Me file,\nI know how to use the software now,\n\n116\n00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.520\nI'm going to instruct you how to do that\nso that you can bypass that option and\n\n117\n00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.130\nforget everything I just said.\n\n118\n00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.747\n>> There we go.\n>> So I click, uncheck that and\n\n119\n00:05:22.747 --> 00:05:24.560\nclick finish.\n\n120\n00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.662\n>> All right, so now we're done, right?\n\n121\n00:05:25.662 --> 00:05:26.185\n>> Now we're done.\n\n122\n00:05:26.185 --> 00:05:26.900\n>> Shortest episode over.\n\n123\n00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.100\n>> This is super, super.\n\n124\n00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.110\n>> That's what I liked about the software,\nit was super quick to install.\n\n125\n00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.680\nDidn't take any kind of crazy options or\nanything like that.\n\n126\n00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.830\nIt's just straight forward.\n\n127\n00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.360\nDo you want this, do you want that,\nokay next and your done.\n\n128\n00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.470\nSo now that I have the software installed,\nI am able to open the Cleopatra\n\n129\n00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.920\nsoftware and check out all of the options,\nand see what they do.\n\n130\n00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.190\nAnd then start encrypting and\ndecrypting, and creating key pairs and\n\n131\n00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.450\nall the things that we\nwanna do with the software.\n\n132\n00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:57.080\nSo let's take a look at the Cleopatra\nsoftware interface, and\n\n133\n00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.630\nsee some of the options\nthat we have available.\n\n134\n00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.310\n>> Yeah, now remember Cleopatra's\ngonna generate our keys.\n\n135\n00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:07.100\nIn order for all of this to work,\nyou need a private key and a public key.\n\n136\n00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.240\nAnd that private key, that's your secret,\nit's the one that you keep,\n\n137\n00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.060\nyou don't give that to anyone.\n\n138\n00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.090\nThat's the one you use for decryption.\n\n139\n00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.680\nThe public key,\nthat's the one you can give to everybody,\n\n140\n00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.530\nthat's the on that you use for encryption.\n\n141\n00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.370\nThat public key,\nyou can put it in your email signature, or\n\n142\n00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:23.560\nyou can post it on the internet.\n\n143\n00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.690\nYou can give it out to the world.\n\n144\n00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.350\nPrint it on the back window of your car.\n\n145\n00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.313\nDo whatever you want with that public key.\n\n146\n00:06:28.313 --> 00:06:33.251\nIf somebody has that public key, they can\ntake it, they can encrypt data with it,\n\n147\n00:06:33.251 --> 00:06:34.907\nand they can send it to you.\n\n148\n00:06:34.907 --> 00:06:38.460\nAnd you, using your private key,\nthe one you keep secret,\n\n149\n00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.603\nyou'll be able to decrypt that and\nread it, right?\n\n150\n00:06:41.603 --> 00:06:42.550\nSo that's important.\n\n151\n00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.510\nWe gotta make sure\nthat's handled properly.\n\n152\n00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.320\nSo we need something to\ngenerate that key pair.\n\n153\n00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.710\nThe public key and the private key.\n\n154\n00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.560\nMeanwhile, whoever you're\ngonna be communicating with,\n\n155\n00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.750\nthey'll probably need\nto do the same thing.\n\n156\n00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.880\nSo if Daniel's gonna send me an email,\n\n157\n00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.470\nwell he needs to encrypt\nit with my public key.\n\n158\n00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.310\nI can only decrypt things that\nwere encrypted with my public key,\n\n159\n00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.170\nand if I wanna send him an email,\nit's the exact opposite.\n\n160\n00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:11.100\nSo he's gonna fire up Cleopatra and\nuse that to generate the keys.\n\n161\n00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.710\nHe's generating the keys for him.\n\n162\n00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:18.420\nThat will allow me to send encrypted\ndata to him, but if he wants to send\n\n163\n00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.880\nemail to me, or just files in general,\nright, doesn't have to be email.\n\n164\n00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.130\nThat if we wanna go the other way,\nwell I've gotta set up keys too.\n\n165\n00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:28.260\nSo for\nthe next part of this segment of the show,\n\n166\n00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.010\nwe're gonna be doing\nthis kind of together.\n\n167\n00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.520\nHe's gonna be generating his keys,\nI'm gonna generate my keys.\n\n168\n00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.400\nWe'll need to exchange our public keys,\nand\n\n169\n00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.620\nthen we'll be able to talk\nto each other securely.\n\n170\n00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.070\nThat's the tricky part with doing all\nthis, is that it involves both ends.\n\n171\n00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:43.980\nYou gotta get the two people involved\nto do secure communications.\n\n172\n00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.630\n>> That's exactly right, Don.\n\n173\n00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:47.772\nAnd that's one of the most\ndifficult concepts for\n\n174\n00:07:47.772 --> 00:07:50.276\npeople to grasp when they\nstart dealing with encryption.\n\n175\n00:07:50.276 --> 00:07:53.061\nThey're like whoa, we've got a public key,\nwe've got a private key.\n\n176\n00:07:53.061 --> 00:07:54.398\nWhich key do I give to whom?\n\n177\n00:07:54.398 --> 00:07:55.977\nAnd who, where, goes what?\n\n178\n00:07:55.977 --> 00:07:58.600\nIt's really simple,\nif it's a public key, it's public.\n\n179\n00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.279\nGive it out like Don said,\nprint it on the back of your car,\n\n180\n00:08:01.279 --> 00:08:02.500\nwherever the case may be.\n\n181\n00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:03.670\nHave a good time with it.\n\n182\n00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:05.990\nYour private key is what\nyou wanna keep secure.\n\n183\n00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.780\nAnd Cleopatra allows us to generate keys,\n\n184\n00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.890\nit also allows us to import\nother people's public keys.\n\n185\n00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:15.490\nIt's complete key management software, and\nthat's what we like so much about it, and\n\n186\n00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.110\nit's super simple to use.\n\n187\n00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:20.160\nSo Don, I say we go ahead and\ngenerate a couple of keys.\n\n188\n00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:20.800\n>> Let's get on it.\n\n189\n00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.510\n>> Let's get doing it.\n\n190\n00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:25.450\nAll right, so if you look at My Computer,\nDon's gonna be doing this on his as well.\n\n191\n00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:28.730\nI'm going to go ahead and\ncreate a new certificate,\n\n192\n00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:31.980\nwhich basically gives me two options.\n\n193\n00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:35.621\nI get the option to Create\na personal OpenPGP key pair and\n\n194\n00:08:35.621 --> 00:08:38.968\nI also have the Create\na personal X509 key pair.\n\n195\n00:08:38.968 --> 00:08:41.350\nWe don't have to worry\nabout that at this point.\n\n196\n00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:45.686\nWe're gonna worry just about the open\nPGP pair, cuz that's what we need.\n\n197\n00:08:45.686 --> 00:08:48.500\n>> And then the OpenPGP, when that's\nprivate we can do that right now and\n\n198\n00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.180\nthose will be usable immediately.\n\n199\n00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:55.470\nIf you do the X509 key pair, you'll notice\nit says generate a key pair and request.\n\n200\n00:08:55.470 --> 00:09:00.505\nThat's if you wanna buy an official\ncertificate from somebody like Verisign or\n\n201\n00:09:00.505 --> 00:09:02.280\nThawte or somebody like that.\n\n202\n00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.970\nBecause the person on the other end,\nthey have to trust our certificate.\n\n203\n00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:08.970\nWell if we make our own, and\nwe know that other person,\n\n204\n00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:11.590\nwell then fine,they'll\ntrust our certificate.\n\n205\n00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:14.270\nBut if this is somebody I've never\ne-mailed before, just out of the blue,\n\n206\n00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:15.720\nthey don't know to trust me.\n\n207\n00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.340\nSo I might wanna get a real certificate\nfrom a paid provider out there on\n\n208\n00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.890\nthe Internet and\nthat's what the X509 key pairs are for.\n\n209\n00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:24.990\nSo it's all coming down to whether you\nwant it to be private just for you.\n\n210\n00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:28.580\nOr if you want it to be through\na public provider like Verisign,\n\n211\n00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:29.300\nthey're the big one.\n\n212\n00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:30.442\nSo we'll just do OpenPGP here.\n\n213\n00:09:30.442 --> 00:09:34.960\n>> Yeah, OpenPGP and like Don said,\ncuz that's gonna get us quickest moving.\n\n214\n00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.710\nWe can start switching files\nin between each other and\n\n215\n00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.320\ndecrypting and re-encrypting.\n\n216\n00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:44.300\nSo I've clicked Create an OpenPGP pair and\nnow it's asking me to enter my details.\n\n217\n00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.927\nMy details here are gonna be my name and\nmy email, and then if I would like,\n\n218\n00:09:47.927 --> 00:09:49.447\nI can create a comment on that,\n\n219\n00:09:49.447 --> 00:09:53.220\nto maybe just add some more\nintegrity to that public key.\n\n220\n00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.460\nSo I'm gonna put my name here,\nso today, I'm James Bond.\n\n221\n00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.902\nSo I'm gonna say James Bond,\ndon't forget the b on that.\n\n222\n00:09:58.902 --> 00:10:06.960\nMy e-mail is jbond@secureco.com.\n\n223\n00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.345\nAnd then I'll just put 007.\n\n224\n00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:14.540\nNow we also have this Advanced Settings\ntab, which you can go into.\n\n225\n00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:20.730\nAnd this allows me to change the default\nencryption rate for my key pair.\n\n226\n00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:22.760\nI'll stick right now just for\nintents and purposes.\n\n227\n00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.560\nIf you wanted to change it to 4096,\n\n228\n00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:28.710\ngive you a whole lot stronger encryption,\nlot tougher to break.\n\n229\n00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:33.735\nBut for right now,\nI just gonna leave it at 2048.\n\n230\n00:10:33.735 --> 00:10:37.020\nAs you can see,\nthere's plenty of change at the DSA.\n\n231\n00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:40.793\nA lot of stuff that we don't need to get\ninto, but just to know that it's there and\n\n232\n00:10:40.793 --> 00:10:42.730\nyou can look these things up later.\n\n233\n00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:45.122\nRight now, if we stick with the defaults,\n\n234\n00:10:45.122 --> 00:10:49.520\nit will allow us to continue to move on\nand create this encryption and key pair.\n\n235\n00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.276\nSo I'm gonna click Next\n>> Yeah, if you choose one of the other\n\n236\n00:10:52.276 --> 00:10:55.302\nkey types, you just have to make sure that\nthe person on the other end supports it.\n\n237\n00:10:55.302 --> 00:10:59.650\nA 2048-bit RSA key is supported\nby pretty much everyone, so\n\n238\n00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:01.010\nthat's a safe bet to go with.\n\n239\n00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:04.310\nBut if you go with one of the more\nadvanced ones, like via ELgamal to DSA,\n\n240\n00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:06.230\nyou can get really secure.\n\n241\n00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:07.684\nBut the person on the other\nend might not support it, so\n\n242\n00:11:07.684 --> 00:11:08.574\nyou have to be careful with that.\n\n243\n00:11:08.574 --> 00:11:12.870\n>> Right, you've got to be compatible\nwith your encryption methods.\n\n244\n00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:15.860\nAll right, so\nnow I have all my details that are there,\n\n245\n00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:20.460\nI can click Create Key and\nmy key will be created.\n\n246\n00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.360\nAt this point,\nit's gonna ask me to enter a Passphrase.\n\n247\n00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.750\nThis is something that you want to\nmake very secure just like any other\n\n248\n00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:28.460\npassword or\npassphrase that you'll come up with.\n\n249\n00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:33.950\nTry to use special characters,\nnumbers, upper and lower case.\n\n250\n00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:37.880\nThis will help keep this secure, because\nthis gonna be something that you need for\n\n251\n00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:41.720\nwhen you are decrypting\nthings using your key.\n\n252\n00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:45.384\nSo I'm gonna enter, just for\nthe intents and purposes of this lab,\n\n253\n00:11:45.384 --> 00:11:47.370\nI'm gonna make it very simple.\n\n254\n00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:51.859\nBut again, try to use as good of\nsecurity create something secure,\n\n255\n00:11:51.859 --> 00:11:57.100\nI'm just gonna use the word passphrase1\n>> [LAUGH] You're doing passphrase1?\n\n256\n00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.180\n>> Passphrase1\n>> I can do the same thing-\n\n257\n00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:00.610\n>> And as you can see,\n\n258\n00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:02.520\nit's got good length and\nits got a number in it,\n\n259\n00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.430\nso it does say that the quality\nof this is good enough.\n\n260\n00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:11.150\nIf you don't use a very secure passphrase,\nit will complain about that.\n\n261\n00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.950\nIt'll say this isn't very secure,\nyou might wanna try something else.\n\n262\n00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:16.440\nBut if you want to continue on,\nit will allow that.\n\n263\n00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.970\nBut I have a good one,\nso I'm gonna click Okay.\n\n264\n00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:22.254\nI may need to reenter that passphrase,\n\n265\n00:12:22.254 --> 00:12:27.210\np-a-s-s-p-h-r-a-s-e-1, click Okay.\n\n266\n00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:30.630\nAnd now I have successfully\ncreated my key pair.\n\n267\n00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:36.020\nI can now export, import and do anything\nI need to do with that key pair to start\n\n268\n00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:38.040\nencrypting and decrypting messages.\n\n269\n00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.932\nSo, do have a couple\nof other options here,\n\n270\n00:12:39.932 --> 00:12:42.858\nwe aren't gonna worry about making\na backup or anything like that.\n\n271\n00:12:42.858 --> 00:12:43.940\nWe're gonna do that manually.\n\n272\n00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:45.911\n>> It is a great idea to\nmake a back up [LAUGH].\n\n273\n00:12:45.911 --> 00:12:47.064\n>> It is a wonderful idea.\n\n274\n00:12:47.064 --> 00:12:49.160\nBut we're gonna be doing that and\n\n275\n00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:53.750\nmanually using our demo here, so we're\nnot gonna worry about that at this point.\n\n276\n00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:55.500\n>> That's right.\n>> So I'm gonna click Finish and\n\n277\n00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:00.860\nnow you see in Cleopatra,\nI have a key pair that has been generated.\n\n278\n00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:02.840\nIt's under my certificates.\n\n279\n00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:06.390\nYou have a couple of different tabs here,\ntrust it's also a trusted certificates.\n\n280\n00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:08.950\nBecause it's mine,\nI created it here, it knows that.\n\n281\n00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:11.060\nAnd then when I have other certificates,\nthey'll show up there.\n\n282\n00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:14.705\nAs you can see I have a few test ones that\nI never actually got rid of apparently.\n\n283\n00:13:14.705 --> 00:13:16.870\n[LAUGH] So I'm gonna delete those.\n\n284\n00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:19.520\n>> You can always untrust a certificate\nif it's no longer valid or\n\n285\n00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.360\nyou don't need it anymore.\n\n286\n00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.810\n>> That's right.\n>> That's exactly what he's doing.\n\n287\n00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:23.802\n>> I'm just gonna go ahead and\ndelete those extra and\n\n288\n00:13:23.802 --> 00:13:26.200\ncreate a new one using the same account.\n\n289\n00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:31.945\nSo now that that's done,\nwe have my key pair, Don has his key pair.\n\n290\n00:13:31.945 --> 00:13:32.580\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n291\n00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:36.644\n>> Now we need to export our public keys,\nbecause they're gonna go public and\n\n292\n00:13:36.644 --> 00:13:38.650\nwe're gonna exchange them.\n\n293\n00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:42.210\nSo Don, let's go ahead and\nwe'll export our public keys.\n\n294\n00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:42.830\n>> All right.\n>> So\n\n295\n00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:45.680\nall we have to do to do that\nis click on the key pair and\n\n296\n00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.440\nthen you have this option that\nsays Export Certificates.\n\n297\n00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:49.698\nVery simple, you click on that.\n\n298\n00:13:49.698 --> 00:13:53.910\nThis is gonna ask you where do you want\nto store this exported certificate.\n\n299\n00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:58.994\nAnd it also gives a crazy name which is\nbasically part of the PGP key, right?\n\n300\n00:13:58.994 --> 00:14:02.698\nAt this point,\nI do tend to make a better file name.\n\n301\n00:14:02.698 --> 00:14:05.450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Something that I can understand in my\n\n302\n00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:06.610\nhuman speak.\n\n303\n00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:09.680\nSo I'm gonna call this jamesPublic and\nthat keeps it easy for me.\n\n304\n00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:15.610\nJamesPublic, that way I know\nit's my public PGP key.\n\n305\n00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:21.950\nThen I'll choose my Desktop\nto save it on and click Save.\n\n306\n00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:24.050\nPerfect.\n\n307\n00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:28.470\nYou'll notice that over on my Desktop,\nI now have a file,\n\n308\n00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:32.864\nthis is jamesPublic,\nit is my public PGP key pair.\n\n309\n00:14:32.864 --> 00:14:35.770\nIf I right-click and\n\n310\n00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:40.840\nsay Open and I select a program, you\ncan see the data that's actually in it.\n\n311\n00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:46.290\nJust use Notepad and\nyou'll see there is my public key block.\n\n312\n00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:49.900\nI can take that piece of information,\nlike Don said earlier.\n\n313\n00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:53.700\nPrint it on my website, put it on my blog,\nstick it, I don't know if it'll\n\n314\n00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:56.289\nfit in a tweet but [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] It might be more than the 140\n\n315\n00:14:56.289 --> 00:14:57.050\ncharacters.\n\n316\n00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:00.074\n>> It might be beyond the 140\ncharacter comments there,\n\n317\n00:15:00.074 --> 00:15:01.841\nbut you put it anywhere you like.\n\n318\n00:15:01.841 --> 00:15:04.490\nBecause you want people to\nhave access to this, so\n\n319\n00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:08.300\nthat they can securely send you\nstuff that you can decrypt later.\n\n320\n00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.260\nThat is the whole purpose of this.\n\n321\n00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.730\nSo now that we have our key pairs,\n\n322\n00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:18.040\nour public keys exported,\nwe now need to exchange them.\n\n323\n00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.505\nThis is where some security\ncan come into play,\n\n324\n00:15:20.505 --> 00:15:26.400\ncuz I don't wanna get a key that's been\ngenerated by someone who says they're Don.\n\n325\n00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:30.380\nAnd then it's not Don and I'm encrypting\nsensitive data and sending it to him.\n\n326\n00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:32.940\nWhich he can then easily decrypt and\n\n327\n00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:35.930\nI've sent them stuff that\nthey should never have.\n\n328\n00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:37.490\nThe best way to get a key pair,\n\n329\n00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:42.250\nis to go, hey Don,\nlet me get that public key from you.\n\n330\n00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:46.592\nGo to Don's website, I know that's Don's\nwebsite, I know that's Don's blog.\n\n331\n00:15:46.592 --> 00:15:48.890\nAgain, the best way is person to person,\nbut\n\n332\n00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:51.445\nthere are some other good\nways to handle them out.\n\n333\n00:15:51.445 --> 00:15:53.341\nLike Don said, from a website or\n\n334\n00:15:53.341 --> 00:15:57.940\nanything that you know is associated\nwith that particular person.\n\n335\n00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.790\nSo, Don and\nI are going to email it to each other.\n\n336\n00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:03.310\nThat's an easy way to get some key pairs.\n\n337\n00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:05.750\n>> And you might freak out at that point,\nand say, wait a minute, wait a minute.\n\n338\n00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:08.220\nThe whole reason I'm watching this\nepisode is cuz I wanna know how to\n\n339\n00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:09.000\nencrypt my email.\n\n340\n00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.360\nWhy would I send this key?\n\n341\n00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.860\nJust remember the public\nkey is perfectly safe.\n\n342\n00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.890\nSomebody could intercept this, yes, and\n\n343\n00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:18.780\nthen once they have it they could\nencrypt data and send it to you.\n\n344\n00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:19.670\nWell, big deal.\n\n345\n00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:20.310\n>> Whoopee.\n\n346\n00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:23.310\n>> They can't decrypt your data so\nits perfectly safe.\n\n347\n00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:26.080\nIt's just validating that it\nactually came from that person,\n\n348\n00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.652\nit's not a spoof email or whatever.\n\n349\n00:16:27.652 --> 00:16:29.510\nSo yeah, if I'm just going to\nattach mine to an email and\n\n350\n00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:30.320\nthat's what you're going to do?\n\n351\n00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.570\n>> That's exactly what we're going to do.\n\n352\n00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:33.600\n>> Sweet, so I'm gonna-\n>> So I'll open my email.\n\n353\n00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.340\nAnd I can already see I have\nDon's public key right here.\n\n354\n00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:42.440\nHe's playing the part of Money Penny,\nand I will go ahead and write a new one.\n\n355\n00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:48.580\nAnd just attach like any other file,\nwhatever email client you're using.\n\n356\n00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:54.710\nI'll just go to my Desktop,\nfind my key, there it is.\n\n357\n00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:59.472\nHit Open and say to MPenny at\n\n358\n00:16:59.472 --> 00:17:04.453\nsecureco.com, and Send.\n\n359\n00:17:04.453 --> 00:17:08.403\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> You sent an email with no subject.\n\n360\n00:17:08.403 --> 00:17:11.180\nI hate that.\n>> Just because I know Don hates that.\n\n361\n00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:11.915\n>> Eh, all right.\n\n362\n00:17:11.915 --> 00:17:15.220\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\nnow we've exchanged public keys.\n\n363\n00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:19.473\nI'm just going to get Don's public key.\n\n364\n00:17:24.372 --> 00:17:26.914\nThere it is.\n\n365\n00:17:26.914 --> 00:17:29.990\nI'm going to save the file, hit OK.\n\n366\n00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:32.013\nIt's going to ask will be\nwhere I like to save it.\n\n367\n00:17:32.013 --> 00:17:34.622\nI'll save it to my desktop\nwith my other public key.\n\n368\n00:17:34.622 --> 00:17:35.525\nIt has been saved.\n\n369\n00:17:35.525 --> 00:17:39.475\nI can shrink my email client down.\n\n370\n00:17:39.475 --> 00:17:42.975\nSo now is the portion of our\nshow where we actually import\n\n371\n00:17:42.975 --> 00:17:45.075\nsomebody else's public key.\n\n372\n00:17:45.075 --> 00:17:48.185\nThat way we can start using\nthat key to encrypt a file and\n\n373\n00:17:48.185 --> 00:17:55.223\nthen send that encrypted safe data\nthrough an open email account.\n\n374\n00:17:55.223 --> 00:18:00.040\nSo, going to here,\nwe just click Import Certificates.\n\n375\n00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:03.470\nThen, like I said, Kleopatra tries\nto make this very simple and\n\n376\n00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:05.165\nintuitive, user-friendly.\n\n377\n00:18:05.165 --> 00:18:06.875\nSo I click import certificates,\n\n378\n00:18:06.875 --> 00:18:11.465\ntakes me to a file browser,\nasks me where is this public certificate?\n\n379\n00:18:11.465 --> 00:18:18.205\nI say it is on my desktop, I find there\nit is right there, hit open, and now\n\n380\n00:18:18.205 --> 00:18:22.035\nas you can see the details of importing,\ntotal number of processed, 1, imported, 1.\n\n381\n00:18:22.035 --> 00:18:29.800\nI hit okay and there is Don's public key.\n\n382\n00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:34.160\nSo now I've successfully imported\nthat into my system and to Kleopatra.\n\n383\n00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.800\nI am managing that key.\n\n384\n00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.680\nI can now use that key\nto encrypt a file and\n\n385\n00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:43.660\nsend it back to Don and only Don can\ndecrypt it and see what's on that message.\n\n386\n00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:45.510\n>> So that's really the end of\nour prep work right there, right?\n\n387\n00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:48.130\nNow at this point we've got Gpg4win.\n\n388\n00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:48.650\n>> Yep.\n\n389\n00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:50.960\n>> We've exchanged our keys.\n\n390\n00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.430\nNow we're ready to actually\nencrypt data and send it securely.\n\n391\n00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:55.020\n>> That is exactly right.\n\n392\n00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:59.840\nSo at this point, all you have to do,\nthe software that we installed,\n\n393\n00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:03.610\nGpg4win has actually created\na right-click menu on things.\n\n394\n00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:04.920\nIt has another way to do it.\n\n395\n00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.270\nThere's two different ways.\n\n396\n00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:10.310\nWe can go into the file\nbrowser that it's created, and\n\n397\n00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:17.210\noften that's available with Kleopatra and\nsay, oh where is it?\n\n398\n00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:17.750\nNow I don't know.\n\n399\n00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.260\nOh, there it is, I'm sorry.\n\n400\n00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.770\nDecrypt and verify files or\nsign and decrypt.\n\n401\n00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:23.530\nWe can start there.\n\n402\n00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:27.540\nWe can say sign in encrypt, and\nit will take us to a file browser.\n\n403\n00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:28.630\nAnd I can find a file.\n\n404\n00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:33.200\nNow I have downloaded a top secret\nUAV project file on my desktop.\n\n405\n00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.640\nI just have to browse to that.\n\n406\n00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.750\nThere it is right there,\na top secret UAV project, and hit Open.\n\n407\n00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:43.840\nNow it's gonna ask me a couple\nof questions about this.\n\n408\n00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.340\nDo I want to archive or not.\n\n409\n00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.170\nRight now,\nI just want to encrypt the thing and\n\n410\n00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:50.600\nsend it to Don so\nhe can decrypt it and get that file.\n\n411\n00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.370\n>> Yeah and I notice there's other options\nthere sign and encrypt and just sign.\n\n412\n00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:57.340\nJust signing will help me\nto verify whether it's been\n\n413\n00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:59.150\ntampered with in transit.\n\n414\n00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:02.380\nThe file will have a hash attached to it,\nI'll generate my own hash and\n\n415\n00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.810\nif they don't match then\nthe files been tampered with.\n\n416\n00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:08.000\nThat doesn't encrypt other people\nwould still be able to read it in\n\n417\n00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.700\nplain text, right?\n\n418\n00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:13.790\nSign and encrypt does both,\ngives us tamper protection and\n\n419\n00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:15.740\nencryption protection, right?\n\n420\n00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:16.800\nBut if you just choose encrypt,\n\n421\n00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.900\nwhat we're choosing here,\nyou don't get that tamper protection.\n\n422\n00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:21.580\nNow a lot of people say well,\nwouldn't I want that?\n\n423\n00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:25.100\nThe neat thing about encryption is if\nsomebody tampers with it, it breaks it.\n\n424\n00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:26.380\nIt won't work, right?\n\n425\n00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:29.500\nSo you won't be able to decrypt it cuz\nthe data's not valid at that point.\n\n426\n00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:34.680\nBut If somebody had that public key,\nthey could have swapped out the encrypted\n\n427\n00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:38.500\ndata with something new, and that might\nlook like a security vulnerability but\n\n428\n00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.930\nat that point really,\nthey could generate their own hash anyway.\n\n429\n00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:46.070\nSo the digital signature doesn't provide\na whole ton of benefit on encrypted data.\n\n430\n00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:48.740\nYou can do both though,\nthere's certainly no reason not to, but\n\n431\n00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:50.010\nwe're just gonna do encryption here.\n\n432\n00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:50.910\n>> Right.\n\n433\n00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:55.560\nSo, since I just wanna encrypt, I'll\nleave it at the default, and click Next.\n\n434\n00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.260\nNow it's gonna ask me which\nkey do I want to use.\n\n435\n00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:03.320\nAnd as you can see, I have both of the\nkeys available at the top of the screen.\n\n436\n00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:08.700\nNow I'm just gonna choose\nDon's Money Penny key and hit Add.\n\n437\n00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:12.570\nAnd when I hit encrypt,\nit's gonna throw a warning saying that if\n\n438\n00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:14.450\nnone of the recipients\nseem to be your own.\n\n439\n00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:18.100\nIt's saying that because if I encrypt\nit only using Don's Public Key,\n\n440\n00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:21.660\nI no longer have the ability\nto decrypt the encrypted file.\n\n441\n00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:28.180\nSo I would either need a secure copy of\nmy own using some other key, like my own.\n\n442\n00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:29.110\nOr I'm done.\n\n443\n00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.960\nI have no ability.\n\n444\n00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:30.520\nI have to wait for\n\n445\n00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:34.970\nDon to send it back to me in some other\nway, maybe encrypting it using my key.\n\n446\n00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:38.830\nBut right now just for our purposes,\nI just want Don to have this file, so\n\n447\n00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:43.120\nI'm just gonna encrypt it using\nhis key and click OK, continue.\n\n448\n00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:46.300\nNow we've encrypted the file.\n\n449\n00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:47.912\nThere it is right there.\n\n450\n00:21:47.912 --> 00:21:50.500\nIt shows us we've got the details,\nthat encryption has succeeded.\n\n451\n00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:51.090\nEverything's good.\n\n452\n00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:52.400\nThere's no warnings.\n\n453\n00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.970\nIt has outputted the file,\n\n454\n00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:58.760\nit's in the same directory path as the\noriginal file, and then I click Finish.\n\n455\n00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:05.320\nNow, I have this top\nsecret UAVproject.pdf.gpg.\n\n456\n00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:09.560\nThat lets me know that that file\nhas been encrypted using PGP or\n\n457\n00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:13.890\nGPG, And it is ready to be attached\nto an email, it is encrypted, and\n\n458\n00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:15.390\nI can send it over the wire safe and\n\n459\n00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:19.140\nsecure, knowing that only Don is going\nto be able to decrypt that file.\n\n460\n00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:23.445\nSo Don at this point,\nI think that's all we have left to do.\n\n461\n00:22:23.445 --> 00:22:27.735\nIs to attach that file, send it\nover to you and decrypt that puppy.\n\n462\n00:22:27.735 --> 00:22:31.635\n>> You know there is one other thing\nthat I might want to point out here,\n\n463\n00:22:31.635 --> 00:22:36.347\nwhich is in terms of sending a file,\nthat's exactly how we want to do it.\n\n464\n00:22:36.347 --> 00:22:39.187\nBut if you're just sending an email, what\nyou're going to have to do is your gonna\n\n465\n00:22:39.187 --> 00:22:41.277\nhave to write an email and\nyou're gonna have to attach that file.\n\n466\n00:22:41.277 --> 00:22:44.074\nWell what if you work somewhere,\nwhere they block attachments?\n\n467\n00:22:44.074 --> 00:22:44.987\n>> Hmm.\n>> All right,\n\n468\n00:22:44.987 --> 00:22:48.450\nwell if attachments are blocked, you\ndon't actually have to use an attachment.\n\n469\n00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:53.110\nYou could just do a straight up\ntext copy and paste type action.\n\n470\n00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:56.090\nAnd that can be really handy if you're\njust writing a quick email message.\n\n471\n00:22:56.090 --> 00:23:00.670\nAnd so what you might do is in your\nemail client, whether it's Outlook or\n\n472\n00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:03.226\nThunderbird or even Gmail,\nweb-based clients,\n\n473\n00:23:03.226 --> 00:23:07.180\nwhatever, you can type your message,\nand you can copy everything you type,\n\n474\n00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:09.870\nor cut really you don't wanna\nleave in there unencrypted.\n\n475\n00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:12.645\nAnd then when you go back to\nKleopatra there's another option,\n\n476\n00:23:12.645 --> 00:23:13.580\nDaniel\n>> Yup\n\n477\n00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:14.540\n>> pull yours up.\n\n478\n00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.970\nIn Kleopatra, if you take\na look all the way at the right\n\n479\n00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:19.605\nside there's a button that says clipboard.\n\n480\n00:23:19.605 --> 00:23:20.130\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So\n\n481\n00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:23.530\nyou can cut the message that you just\ntyped and you can go up there and\n\n482\n00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:27.150\nyou can chose to encrypt\nwhat's in the clipboard and\n\n483\n00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:30.630\nit will encrypt that message, and\nyou can choose, if you choose that,\n\n484\n00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:34.590\nit will have a little bit where you can go\nthrough there and it will generate that.\n\n485\n00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:37.980\nAnd you can just take the output\nthat it generates and\n\n486\n00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:39.960\ncopy and paste that back into the email.\n\n487\n00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.200\nAnd the data that gets pasted back\ninto the email, it's now just text,\n\n488\n00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.000\nit's not an attachment anymore.\n\n489\n00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.006\nBut it's an encrypted hash, it says like\nbegin PGP something or another, right?\n\n490\n00:23:49.006 --> 00:23:52.349\nAnd then it has all this Java mess,\nand then it has NPGP, right?\n\n491\n00:23:52.349 --> 00:23:54.149\nAnd so you can just copy and paste it.\n\n492\n00:23:54.149 --> 00:23:57.724\nSo using the clipboard functionality Is\nreally handy if you don't want to deal\n\n493\n00:23:57.724 --> 00:23:58.652\nwith attachments.\n\n494\n00:23:58.652 --> 00:24:01.390\nBut, attachments are certainly\neasier in my opinion.\n\n495\n00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:06.670\n>> Yeah, definitely, the clipboard will\nbe very user friendly as you become more\n\n496\n00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:09.500\ncomfortable using the software, because\nyou're like, oh I don't want to go through\n\n497\n00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:14.210\nthe mess of creating an e-mail, and\nthen encrypting it and using attachments.\n\n498\n00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:17.140\nLike Don said, that clipboard's going to\nbe your best friend after you get very\n\n499\n00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:18.270\ncomfortable with this.\n\n500\n00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:21.040\nBut for right now, we're gonna attach\nthe file that we've outputted.\n\n501\n00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:24.360\nAnd shoot over to Don,\nhe's gonna decrypt it.\n\n502\n00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.430\n>> All right, so send away.\n\n503\n00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:26.110\nI'm waiting for it.\n\n504\n00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:27.620\n>> I'm opening Thunderbird right now.\n\n505\n00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:29.460\n>> And\nif you send it with no subject line,\n\n506\n00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:31.600\nI'll have no way of telling it apart\nfrom the last e-mail you sent me.\n\n507\n00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.010\n>> That's right, well maybe I'll\nput something on it for you.\n\n508\n00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:37.681\n>> You need to learn\nsome e-mail etiquette.\n\n509\n00:24:37.681 --> 00:24:42.800\n[LAUGH] He just jotting up a standard\nemail, and he's gonna attach that file.\n\n510\n00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.720\nNow the file's encrypted at this point,\nso it doesn't matter what it was,\n\n511\n00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.840\nif it was a pdf, a text file,\nan image, who cares?\n\n512\n00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.160\nIt's been fully encrypted.\n\n513\n00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.480\nIf somebody were to edit it,\n\n514\n00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:55.560\nwhen they edit that file all they see is\nthat encrypted mess, the cipher text.\n\n515\n00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.610\nSo there's nothing they can do with that.\n\n516\n00:24:57.610 --> 00:24:58.390\nBut it will come across.\n\n517\n00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:01.650\nNow because it's a file attachment you\nhave to type something in here, right,\n\n518\n00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:02.570\na from and a to.\n\n519\n00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:04.780\nYou gotta have that so\nwe know where the email is going to.\n\n520\n00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:07.770\nSo you're not hiding the fact that\nyou sent an email to a person.\n\n521\n00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:09.550\nRight?\nThat is not anonymous.\n\n522\n00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:12.120\nWhat you're hiding is\nthe content inside of it.\n\n523\n00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.560\nSo you might not want that\nsubject line to be relevant.\n\n524\n00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:18.580\nI make fun of Daniel about it but,\n[LAUGH] if you're trying to securely\n\n525\n00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:21.730\ncommunicate your data, you don't want\nyour subject line giving away something.\n\n526\n00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:25.340\nSo you might just put in that\nsubject line Encrypted contents or\n\n527\n00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:26.920\nsomething like that and send along.\n\n528\n00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.300\nSo I just got Daniel's and\nthat's exactly what he did.\n\n529\n00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.100\nThe subject line says top secret.\n\n530\n00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:33.750\nLet's pull my computer up here and\nthere it is.\n\n531\n00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:36.760\nSo I just got this email from James Bond,\nsays top secret.\n\n532\n00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:40.480\nAnd when I look at it, it's got\na fairly meaningless message body, but\n\n533\n00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.620\nit does have an attachment down here.\n\n534\n00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:47.140\nNow the file name that you\nchose was the UAVProject.pdf.\n\n535\n00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:50.450\nSo if somebody were to intercept this,\nthey would know what the file was, and\n\n536\n00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:51.480\nagain, you might not want that.\n\n537\n00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.400\nYou might want to change that name.\n\n538\n00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:56.430\nAnd, if you're doing the copy paste\nmethod, you could paste the encrypted junk\n\n539\n00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:59.400\nright here and wouldn't necessarily\nhave a file name at that point.\n\n540\n00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.690\nBut since I've got the file name, here,\n\n541\n00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:03.250\nI kinda know what it is,\nI just need to be able to decrypt it.\n\n542\n00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:03.750\n>> Right.\n\n543\n00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:10.370\n>> All right, so I'm gonna start just\nby saving this to my desktop, and\n\n544\n00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:12.890\nwhen I save it,\nI'm getting it out of the email system.\n\n545\n00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:17.530\nNow remember, one of the big advantages to\nthis is that we get end to end security.\n\n546\n00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:19.900\nDaniel encrypted it on his laptop.\n\n547\n00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.610\nSo before it even crossed network,\nit was already encrypted.\n\n548\n00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:24.940\nWhile it sat on that mail server,\nit was encrypted.\n\n549\n00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:28.190\nWhen I downloaded it from the mail\nserver to Thunderbird, it was encrypted.\n\n550\n00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:32.030\nAnd only now that I've save it to my\nmachine am I going to decrypt it.\n\n551\n00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:34.450\nSo if somebody wanted to intercept this,\n\n552\n00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:37.910\nthey would have to either compromise\nDaniel's machine or my machine.\n\n553\n00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:41.370\nThat's a big improvement\nover things like S/MIME and\n\n554\n00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:44.636\neven TLS where the emails are routinely\n>> Decrypted.\n\n555\n00:26:44.636 --> 00:26:46.050\n>> decrypted, there we go.\n\n556\n00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:47.370\nAt certain legs along the journey,\n\n557\n00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:51.290\nthere's more than one point\nwhere people can attack those.\n\n558\n00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:53.040\nHere it's end to end,\nthere's only two points.\n\n559\n00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.190\nHis machine, my machine.\n\n560\n00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:57.263\nAll right?\nSo, what do I do now Daniel?\n\n561\n00:26:57.263 --> 00:27:00.790\n>> Alright Don so you've downloaded\nthe file to your desktop.\n\n562\n00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:03.890\nNow the great thing about\nthe software that we've installed\n\n563\n00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:08.640\nis that we have the ability to right-click\non the file that we have downloaded,\n\n564\n00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.830\nand we have Decrypt and Verify.\n\n565\n00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:12.260\nMakes it super simple.\n\n566\n00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:16.040\nAgain, we like easy, we like free,\nthis is easy and free.\n\n567\n00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:16.890\n>> All right.\n>> All right,\n\n568\n00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:20.510\nso at this point you're met\nwith a couple of options.\n\n569\n00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:24.440\nYou can, if you work with signatures or\nanything, you can put in that stuff.\n\n570\n00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:28.440\nRight now, the easiest thing to\ndo is hit decrypt and verify.\n\n571\n00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.760\n>> Now, it's going to look at\nthe certificates that I've got and\n\n572\n00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:35.110\nhere it's asking me about\nmy own certificate right.\n\n573\n00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:38.290\nDaniel encrypted it with my public key.\n\n574\n00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:41.490\nI've got my private key, and\nI put a pass phrase on it.\n\n575\n00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:42.410\nIt is asking for that.\n\n576\n00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:44.030\nI will punch in my pass phrase and\n\n577\n00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:46.480\nhere's hoping I didn't mess\nit up when I typed it in.\n\n578\n00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.450\nThere we go.\n\n579\n00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:51.940\nSo it's gonna decrypt it, and\nnow it says it succeeded.\n\n580\n00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:56.100\nAnd if I hit okay, I can see I\nnow have a PDF file right here.\n\n581\n00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:58.700\nAnd if I fire that up, there it is.\n\n582\n00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:00.910\nMy little e-mail from\nthe Under Secretary of Defense.\n\n583\n00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:02.495\nI'm assuming.\nI mean this has been declassified.\n\n584\n00:28:02.495 --> 00:28:03.809\n>> This is declassified material.\n\n585\n00:28:03.809 --> 00:28:05.315\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, I love how I say that and\n\n586\n00:28:05.315 --> 00:28:07.005\nwhile I say it I'm scrolling down.\n\n587\n00:28:07.005 --> 00:28:09.705\nI'm like, I hope this is declassified,\nlet me show it all.\n\n588\n00:28:09.705 --> 00:28:11.808\n>> I think there's some three\nletter agencies here to see you.\n\n589\n00:28:11.808 --> 00:28:14.447\n[LAUGH]\n>> All of a sudden you hear that\n\n590\n00:28:14.447 --> 00:28:16.130\nthe live feed goes dead.\n\n591\n00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:18.650\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, what's going on?\n\n592\n00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:24.330\n>> Let me take a look at\nthe file before I decrypted it.\n\n593\n00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:28.060\nIf somebody were to get this file before\nwe decrypted it, if they were to take that\n\n594\n00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:31.080\nand open it, and like Daniel said earlier,\nif you were to use something\n\n595\n00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:35.030\nlike Notepad to pull it open, well, when\nwe open that up, what would somebody see?\n\n596\n00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:37.630\n>> A whole lot of gobbledygook.\n\n597\n00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:38.750\n>> Yeah.\nJust mess.\n\n598\n00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:41.870\nAnd you know, it's a pdf file so\nyou're going to see mess anyway, but\n\n599\n00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:44.300\neven if it was a straight\nup text file they\n\n600\n00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:48.715\nwould just see a little block that\nsaid this was a PGP cipher text, and\n\n601\n00:28:48.715 --> 00:28:53.435\nyou just see garbled mess\nlike this that's meaningless.\n\n602\n00:28:53.435 --> 00:28:55.825\nYou can't open this up any other means.\n\n603\n00:28:55.825 --> 00:28:56.995\nIf I were to take this file and\n\n604\n00:28:56.995 --> 00:29:02.295\nrename it, cuz it actually does end in\n.asc, which is not a normal PDF file.\n\n605\n00:29:02.295 --> 00:29:04.305\nIf we were to rename that.\n\n606\n00:29:04.305 --> 00:29:06.730\nLet me have some fun with this.\n\n607\n00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:11.880\n[LAUGH] So, it is, well,\nit actually ends in gpg, I guess.\n\n608\n00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:12.900\n>> Yeah, it does end in gpg.\n\n609\n00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:18.740\n>> So I wanna rename that and I'll just\ncall it test.pdf cuz I'm a lazy typer.\n\n610\n00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:20.350\nAnd so now I've got it renamed,\n\n611\n00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:23.590\nif I try to open that up\n>> See Adobe Reader says\n\n612\n00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:25.790\nit's a corrupt file,\nit can't open that up.\n\n613\n00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:28.750\nSo it's encrypted, it's safe, right.\n\n614\n00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:30.960\nDoing it this way uses attachments.\n\n615\n00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:34.830\nIf we had done it as a message body with\njust the copy and the paste method, when I\n\n616\n00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:41.390\ngot Daniel's e-mail it would have had\njust a bunch of Ciphered text right here.\n\n617\n00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:45.200\nAnd I would have just highlighted that and\ncopied it and\n\n618\n00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:49.460\nthen gone over to Kleopatra and gone to\nclipboard and I don't have anything in my\n\n619\n00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:51.830\nclipboard right now but\nyou've got decrypt and verify.\n\n620\n00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:54.390\nAnd I'd be able to decrypt\nwhat's in my clipboard\n\n621\n00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:56.430\njust like we did with\nthe file right there.\n\n622\n00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:57.960\nTwo different ways to go about it.\n\n623\n00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:00.060\nIf you're trying to secure files,\npictures,\n\n624\n00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:03.910\nimages other documents, then doing\nthe attachment, that's the way to do it.\n\n625\n00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:06.960\nIf you're trying to just encrypt\nyour email message body,\n\n626\n00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.180\nit can be faster to do\nthe clipboard method.\n\n627\n00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:11.530\nThey both do the exact same thing.\n\n628\n00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:12.710\nIt's just a different presentation.\n\n629\n00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:15.040\n>> Well done.\n\n630\n00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:19.170\nI think we've gone through the rigmarole\nof actually encrypting and\n\n631\n00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:23.320\ndecrypting, getting the Kleopatra\nsoftware installed.\n\n632\n00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.230\nAnything we've left out, you think?\n\n633\n00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:27.040\n>> Well just the other thing,\nI wanna reiterate,\n\n634\n00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.760\nI've already said it, but\nthis is one solution.\n\n635\n00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:33.970\nIf you wanna do this today, GPG for\nWin with Kleopatra, super easy,\n\n636\n00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:36.270\nworks great on Windows.\n\n637\n00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:39.580\nIf you want to use other software,\nyou absolutely can.\n\n638\n00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:44.260\nSemantic PGP is the commercial entity\nthat kinda dominates this market, so\n\n639\n00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:45.430\nthat's one that's out there.\n\n640\n00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:48.120\nThere's plenty of other\nopen source solutions and\n\n641\n00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:51.490\nother paid solutions that are out there,\nthey all work the same, right?\n\n642\n00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:52.100\n>> That's exactly right.\n\n643\n00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:55.050\n>> They all use this open PGP\nstandard that's very, very effective.\n\n644\n00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:59.513\nThe other thing is, you might not want\nto do just a private key like we did,\n\n645\n00:30:59.513 --> 00:31:04.890\njust the self-signed PGP ones, you might\nwant to go out and buy a real certificate.\n\n646\n00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:07.970\nAnd a lot of the certificate vendors out\nthere offer discounted certificates for\n\n647\n00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:09.800\nthis purpose,\nbecause a lot of people don't use it and\n\n648\n00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.120\nthey're trying to encourage\nsecurity awareness.\n\n649\n00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:17.030\nSo those X.509 certificates you can get\nthose for as little as $20 a year for\n\n650\n00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:18.800\na personal account.\n\n651\n00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.120\nThat's very reasonable.\n\n652\n00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:22.830\nIf you're a commercial entity though,\nif you've got thousands of employees,\n\n653\n00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:24.591\nthat can get real expensive really fast.\n\n654\n00:31:24.591 --> 00:31:28.520\nAnd so, setting up your own public key\ninfrastructure might be necessary to get\n\n655\n00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:29.550\nthis implemented.\n\n656\n00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:31.465\nBut the best part of this whole solution,\n\n657\n00:31:31.465 --> 00:31:35.078\nthe whole solution the the thing that\nmakes this worth while is that it's end to\n\n658\n00:31:35.078 --> 00:31:37.499\nend encryption no matter\nhow you transmit the file.\n\n659\n00:31:37.499 --> 00:31:41.418\nSo if you transmit via email,\nvia FTP, via you know any\n\n660\n00:31:41.418 --> 00:31:42.256\n>> You name it\n\n661\n00:31:42.256 --> 00:31:44.420\n>> Yeah, any unsecure communication,\n\n662\n00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:48.110\nthe data's already encrypted, so you don't\ncare about that, and your data is safe.\n\n663\n00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:49.950\n>> Well, guys,\nthat's all we have for this episode.\n\n664\n00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:51.255\nWe hope you really enjoyed it.\n\n665\n00:31:51.255 --> 00:31:53.960\nSo stay tuned, watch some of the other\nepisodes that we have coming up for\n\n666\n00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:56.200\nPGP and encryption.\n\n667\n00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.930\nWe've got Linux, we've got Mac.\n\n668\n00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:00.160\nYou name it,\nwe're gonna try to make a show for it.\n\n669\n00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:03.047\nBut until that, this is Daniel Lowery and\nwe'll see you next time.\n\n670\n00:32:03.047 --> 00:32:07.948\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
