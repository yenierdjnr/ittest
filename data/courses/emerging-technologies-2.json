ITPROTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.498 --> 00:00:12.720\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.439\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPROTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:19.348\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode we're gonna take\n\n7\n00:00:19.348 --> 00:00:23.470\na look at emerging technology,\nspecifically the Gartner STREET process.\n\n8\n00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.566\nJoining us in the studio to help lend his\nexpertise on that topic, our good friend,\n\n9\n00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:28.395\nMr. Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:29.008\nDon, welcome to the show, sir.\n\n11\n00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:30.286\nHow's it going today?\n\n12\n00:00:30.286 --> 00:00:30.919\n&gt;&gt; It is going great, Daniel.\n\n13\n00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:32.240\nReady to dive right into this one.\n\n14\n00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.472\nAnd for those of you that aren't familiar\nwith it, the Gartner STREET process is\n\n15\n00:00:36.472 --> 00:00:40.395\nreally a neat framework that helps us\nto evaluate emerging technologies,\n\n16\n00:00:40.395 --> 00:00:43.900\nto determine whether or\nnot they're right for our organization.\n\n17\n00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.700\nAnd so in this episode,\nwe're gonna run through that process.\n\n18\n00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.572\nWe're gonna learn about the different\nsteps, kinda see what's involved, and help\n\n19\n00:00:49.572 --> 00:00:53.446\nus to make better decisions when it comes\nto evaluating, and ultimately selecting,\n\n20\n00:00:53.446 --> 00:00:56.281\nan emerging technology to put\nit in use inside of our company.\n\n21\n00:00:56.281 --> 00:01:00.770\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Don, we've thrown\naround that term, emerging technologies.\n\n22\n00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.377\nI think a good place to start would be,\nwhat is an emerging technology?\n\n23\n00:01:03.377 --> 00:01:06.915\n&gt;&gt; All right, and that's really important,\nbecause this whole course is about that.\n\n24\n00:01:06.915 --> 00:01:09.034\nBut Gartner actually has\na very specific definition for\n\n25\n00:01:09.034 --> 00:01:10.669\nwhat they feel is an emerging technology.\n\n26\n00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:14.808\nSo let me bring up here on my system\nwhat their official definition is for\n\n27\n00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:16.328\nan emerging technology.\n\n28\n00:01:16.328 --> 00:01:21.261\nIt is those technologies that are not yet\nmature in the marketplace and\n\n29\n00:01:21.261 --> 00:01:24.280\nso entail a higher-than-average risk.\n\n30\n00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.341\nRight, we could translate\nthat as meaning anything new.\n\n31\n00:01:27.341 --> 00:01:29.967\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If there's something new that has\n\n32\n00:01:29.967 --> 00:01:33.257\nonly been out for a brief while, it's\ncutting edge, bleeding edge technology.\n\n33\n00:01:33.257 --> 00:01:34.616\nIt might be great.\n\n34\n00:01:34.616 --> 00:01:37.969\nIt might be the next big thing.\n\n35\n00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:41.912\nBut for every great success that's\nout there, there are failures, and\n\n36\n00:01:41.912 --> 00:01:43.410\nusually a lot of failures.\n\n37\n00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.285\nAnd there's nothing worse than making\na substantial financial investment\n\n38\n00:01:48.285 --> 00:01:51.179\nin a technology,\nonly to have it collapse and\n\n39\n00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:54.009\nno longer be in use,\nno longer be relevant.\n\n40\n00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.552\n&gt;&gt; Now, Don, is emerging technologies\nthe same as disruptive technologies?\n\n41\n00:01:57.552 --> 00:02:00.065\n&gt;&gt; I'm glad you mentioned that,\nDaniel, cuz the two terms,\n\n42\n00:02:00.065 --> 00:02:01.329\nthey get interchanged a lot.\n\n43\n00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:02.962\nYou'll see a lot of sites and\n\n44\n00:02:02.962 --> 00:02:06.106\ntexts that'll actually just\nuse them synonymously.\n\n45\n00:02:06.106 --> 00:02:07.797\nAnd they are actually different, right?\n\n46\n00:02:07.797 --> 00:02:08.872\nSubtly different, but they are different.\n\n47\n00:02:08.872 --> 00:02:13.170\nSo there's not really an official\ndisruptive technology definition, but\n\n48\n00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.137\nMargaret Rouse had a really\ngood definition for it.\n\n49\n00:02:16.137 --> 00:02:20.692\nShe said it's one that displaces\nan established technology and\n\n50\n00:02:20.692 --> 00:02:22.462\nshakes up the industry or\n\n51\n00:02:22.462 --> 00:02:28.046\na ground-breaking product that creates\na completely new industry, right?\n\n52\n00:02:28.046 --> 00:02:32.601\nAnd if you think about that, every now and\nthen, there's something that comes out\n\n53\n00:02:32.601 --> 00:02:35.531\nthat really changes the way\nthat people do business,\n\n54\n00:02:35.531 --> 00:02:38.413\nthat really just completely\nshakes up an industry.\n\n55\n00:02:38.413 --> 00:02:42.720\nSo, for example, take universities, right?\n\n56\n00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.838\nWhen I was in college,\nyou physically went to the university, and\n\n57\n00:02:45.838 --> 00:02:47.243\nattended class right there.\n\n58\n00:02:47.243 --> 00:02:48.522\nThe professor was in the room with you.\n\n59\n00:02:48.522 --> 00:02:49.927\nAnd that's how you learned.\n\n60\n00:02:49.927 --> 00:02:51.534\nAnd that was the only option.\n\n61\n00:02:51.534 --> 00:02:52.812\nThere were no other choices.\n\n62\n00:02:52.812 --> 00:02:54.706\nBut, look at university students today.\n\n63\n00:02:54.706 --> 00:02:57.177\nWe have so many choices available to you.\n\n64\n00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:58.203\nYou can do online training.\n\n65\n00:02:58.203 --> 00:02:59.355\nYou can do in person.\n\n66\n00:02:59.355 --> 00:03:00.550\nYou can do hybrid, where it's both.\n\n67\n00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.610\nYou can do synchronous and asynchronous,\nso many different choices.\n\n68\n00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.988\nAnd a lot of that is due to disruptive\ntechnologies, ones that came and\n\n69\n00:03:06.988 --> 00:03:08.888\nreally shuffled up that marketplace.\n\n70\n00:03:08.888 --> 00:03:12.740\nYou'll see technologies\nlike electronic cars,\n\n71\n00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.430\nwhere you had the Toyota Prius or\nthe Tesla, where it's fully electric.\n\n72\n00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.770\nWhat's that doing to the oil industry?\n\n73\n00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.316\nIt's really disrupting\ntheir business model.\n\n74\n00:03:23.316 --> 00:03:25.649\nAnd eventually it'll ultimately\ndestroy that business model.\n\n75\n00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:26.347\nThat's disruptive.\n\n76\n00:03:26.347 --> 00:03:31.062\nBut an emerging technology doesn't\nhave to be disruptive, right?\n\n77\n00:03:31.062 --> 00:03:34.896\nEvery disruptive technology was\nemerging at some point, right?\n\n78\n00:03:34.896 --> 00:03:37.051\nSo you can kind of use\nthat interchangeably.\n\n79\n00:03:37.051 --> 00:03:40.182\nBut every emerging technology\nis not necessarily disruptive.\n\n80\n00:03:40.182 --> 00:03:43.842\nSometimes there's new things that\ncome out that they make life better.\n\n81\n00:03:43.842 --> 00:03:46.596\nThey help you achieve your goal,\nbut it's still the same goal,\n\n82\n00:03:46.596 --> 00:03:47.930\nit's still the same process.\n\n83\n00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:48.842\nIt didn't really disrupt.\n\n84\n00:03:48.842 --> 00:03:50.493\nSo be careful with those two terms.\n\n85\n00:03:50.493 --> 00:03:54.921\nSo they are subtly different in\nthe way they can be used and\n\n86\n00:03:54.921 --> 00:03:56.774\nthe way that they mean.\n\n87\n00:03:56.774 --> 00:03:58.581\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don.\nWell, how does the STREET process\n\n88\n00:03:58.581 --> 00:04:01.123\nhelp us when dealing with\nemerging technologies?\n\n89\n00:04:01.123 --> 00:04:04.003\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\nthe STREET process actually breaks this\n\n90\n00:04:04.003 --> 00:04:06.840\nup into six different steps,\nright, it's a framework.\n\n91\n00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.804\nAnd it's designed for\nyou to step through it, step by step,\n\n92\n00:04:10.804 --> 00:04:14.014\nto evaluate a new technology\nthat's out there.\n\n93\n00:04:14.014 --> 00:04:16.271\nAnd so I've got up here on the screen\nthat the STREET process and\n\n94\n00:04:16.271 --> 00:04:17.430\nkind of the way that it lays out.\n\n95\n00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.935\nAnd let me just do a quick\nhigh level overview of it, and\n\n96\n00:04:19.935 --> 00:04:23.164\nthen we'll kinda dive into each step\nin a little more detail, right?\n\n97\n00:04:23.164 --> 00:04:27.363\nBasically, we start with\nwhat's called the scope step.\n\n98\n00:04:27.363 --> 00:04:32.818\nAnd the scope step is where we start to\nevaluate what our business need is, right?\n\n99\n00:04:32.818 --> 00:04:34.000\nEvery company has needs, and\n\n100\n00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.944\nyou might be able to do something\nbetter if you had certain technologies.\n\n101\n00:04:36.944 --> 00:04:39.207\nYou're not even worried about what\nthe technology is at this point.\n\n102\n00:04:39.207 --> 00:04:41.118\nJust what is my need?\n\n103\n00:04:41.118 --> 00:04:42.723\nAnd from there, we go into track.\n\n104\n00:04:42.723 --> 00:04:45.659\nAnd we can track new,\nemerging technologies, right?\n\n105\n00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:47.800\nWhat's new?\nWhat's out there in the industry?\n\n106\n00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.878\nWhat might be able to\nmeet a business need?\n\n107\n00:04:48.878 --> 00:04:51.332\nWhat aligns with my scope?\n\n108\n00:04:51.332 --> 00:04:53.710\nAnd see how the arrows go back and\nforth, right?\n\n109\n00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.500\nI might have a business need,\nand I look for a solution.\n\n110\n00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.550\nAnd that's tracking, right?\n\n111\n00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.258\nOr I might find a solution, and\nthen look for the business need.\n\n112\n00:05:01.258 --> 00:05:02.242\nI might go the other way around.\n\n113\n00:05:02.242 --> 00:05:04.251\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Somebody comes to me and says, Don,\n\n114\n00:05:04.251 --> 00:05:05.502\nif you're not using product x,\n\n115\n00:05:05.502 --> 00:05:08.823\nyou're really doing yourself a disservice-\n&gt;&gt; You're talking about a hammer looking\n\n116\n00:05:08.823 --> 00:05:09.511\nfor a nail right?\n\n117\n00:05:09.511 --> 00:05:10.665\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly!\n\n118\n00:05:10.665 --> 00:05:14.253\nAnd so I need to go back and look at my\nscope and then see, could I have that?\n\n119\n00:05:14.253 --> 00:05:16.410\nOr maybe I need to reevaluate my scope.\n\n120\n00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.143\nMaybe my company's vision of\nthe future is no longer the future.\n\n121\n00:05:19.143 --> 00:05:22.329\nAnd I need to say, all right,\nif we're going to stay relevant,\n\n122\n00:05:22.329 --> 00:05:24.043\nhow do we need to change and adapt?\n\n123\n00:05:24.043 --> 00:05:27.194\nNow, once we've evaluated some\ntechnologies that are out there,\n\n124\n00:05:27.194 --> 00:05:28.085\nwe move into rank.\n\n125\n00:05:28.085 --> 00:05:30.417\nAnd in the rank step,\nthat's where we start looking,\n\n126\n00:05:30.417 --> 00:05:32.661\ncuz there's maybe more than one solution,\nright?\n\n127\n00:05:32.661 --> 00:05:34.021\nSo, which one is gonna be better for us?\n\n128\n00:05:34.021 --> 00:05:37.448\nWe need to rank them, and\ncategorize them, quantify, qualify,\n\n129\n00:05:37.448 --> 00:05:41.930\nall the statistical things that we like to\ndo, and the just business case evaluation.\n\n130\n00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.383\nAll those things that we use to rank and\n\n131\n00:05:43.383 --> 00:05:45.299\ndetermine which solution\nis going to be the best.\n\n132\n00:05:45.299 --> 00:05:48.223\nAnd that's gonna result\nin innovation candidates.\n\n133\n00:05:48.223 --> 00:05:52.693\nThese are all potential\ntechnologies that we could deploy.\n\n134\n00:05:52.693 --> 00:05:53.931\nSome may be great.\nSome may be poor.\n\n135\n00:05:53.931 --> 00:05:56.110\nSome may have a future, some may not.\n\n136\n00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.840\nWe don't necessarily know.\n\n137\n00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.005\nIt's not until we get to the evaluate\nstep that we really find out.\n\n138\n00:06:01.005 --> 00:06:02.651\nThis is where we do our deep research.\n\n139\n00:06:02.651 --> 00:06:07.028\nWe really look into the technology and\ntry and answer any unanswered question,\n\n140\n00:06:07.028 --> 00:06:08.740\nso that we can make a decision.\n\n141\n00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.093\nOnce we make a decision, we evangelize.\n\n142\n00:06:11.093 --> 00:06:13.764\nWe promote that technology\ninside of our company.\n\n143\n00:06:13.764 --> 00:06:17.717\nYou wanna make sure that your employees,\nyour key stakeholders, your managers,\n\n144\n00:06:17.717 --> 00:06:20.154\nthat they all agree that\nthis is a good technology.\n\n145\n00:06:20.154 --> 00:06:23.157\nThey wanna use it, they wanna make\nthe company better by using it.\n\n146\n00:06:23.157 --> 00:06:24.753\nIf you don't have buy\nin from the employees,\n\n147\n00:06:24.753 --> 00:06:27.283\nit doesn't matter what tools you give\nthem or resources you give them.\n\n148\n00:06:27.283 --> 00:06:29.811\nIf they don't use them,\nit's not going to succeed.\n\n149\n00:06:29.811 --> 00:06:32.533\nAnd then at the end, we have transfer.\n\n150\n00:06:32.533 --> 00:06:37.521\nTransfer is where the team that kind\nof selected this technology hands\n\n151\n00:06:37.521 --> 00:06:40.575\noff control of it to someone else, right?\n\n152\n00:06:40.575 --> 00:06:42.101\nIn the project management world,\n\n153\n00:06:42.101 --> 00:06:44.676\nall of the STREET process will\nbe applied as a project, and\n\n154\n00:06:44.676 --> 00:06:48.322\nthen after the project is done, it becomes\nwhat's called an ongoing operation.\n\n155\n00:06:48.322 --> 00:06:51.336\nSomebody else takes over, and now they\nrun through it routinely and use it.\n\n156\n00:06:51.336 --> 00:06:53.367\nThat's what transfer is all about.\n\n157\n00:06:53.367 --> 00:06:56.479\nAnd the person we transfer to may\ncome from within the team that does\n\n158\n00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:59.218\nthe selection,\nit may be a completely different person.\n\n159\n00:06:59.218 --> 00:07:02.734\nBut we transfer it off and then we move\non to selecting our next product, right,\n\n160\n00:07:02.734 --> 00:07:04.160\nour next emerging technology.\n\n161\n00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.033\nSo that's a high level overview\nof how the STREET process works.\n\n162\n00:07:08.033 --> 00:07:12.399\nAnd each step is designed to help us take\nwhat could be a big problem or a big risk,\n\n163\n00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:15.350\nand break it up into pieces so\nit becomes manageable.\n\n164\n00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:19.684\nWe can make smart decisions along the way,\nand ultimately make better decisions.\n\n165\n00:07:19.684 --> 00:07:20.558\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don,\n\n166\n00:07:20.558 --> 00:07:23.890\nwe've seen the theory behind this\nlittle STREET process of yours.\n\n167\n00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:26.237\nHow does that look when\nwe go onto the field?\n\n168\n00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:27.902\nCan you give us an example of that?\n\n169\n00:07:27.902 --> 00:07:30.555\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nlet's create a fictitious company here.\n\n170\n00:07:30.555 --> 00:07:32.743\nWe're gonna do Rite Inspection Software,\nright?\n\n171\n00:07:32.743 --> 00:07:35.892\nThey're a company, and\nthey make inspection software for\n\n172\n00:07:35.892 --> 00:07:37.724\ndoing home inspections, right?\n\n173\n00:07:37.724 --> 00:07:41.328\nAnd their software is designed where\npeople can go out in the field,\n\n174\n00:07:41.328 --> 00:07:45.564\nthey can evaluate homes, or whatever,\ncome up with the building inspection,\n\n175\n00:07:45.564 --> 00:07:48.808\nstore it in a database, and\nshare that with their customer.\n\n176\n00:07:48.808 --> 00:07:53.354\nNow this company is a mid-size company,\nthey're a Type B organization.\n\n177\n00:07:53.354 --> 00:07:55.454\nAnd what that means is they're\nnot afraid to take risks.\n\n178\n00:07:55.454 --> 00:07:59.366\nBut they won't take a risk unless\nthey can actually justify it right?\n\n179\n00:07:59.366 --> 00:08:00.654\nThey got to have a business case.\n\n180\n00:08:00.654 --> 00:08:04.995\nThere's some companies,\nsome people like, who's that?\n\n181\n00:08:04.995 --> 00:08:06.434\nRichard Branson, the Virgin guy?\n\n182\n00:08:06.434 --> 00:08:07.362\n&gt;&gt; The Virgin guy, yeah.\n\n183\n00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:10.223\n&gt;&gt; He'll take risks all over the place\nbecause he's got a ton of money, right?\n\n184\n00:08:10.223 --> 00:08:10.837\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n185\n00:08:10.837 --> 00:08:14.167\nhe knows the bigger the risk\nthe bigger the reward.\n\n186\n00:08:14.167 --> 00:08:18.847\nBut for most companies not taking risk\nis not really an option because then you\n\n187\n00:08:18.847 --> 00:08:19.573\nstagnate.\n\n188\n00:08:19.573 --> 00:08:22.268\nYou don't grow and\neventually you'll become obsolete.\n\n189\n00:08:22.268 --> 00:08:25.652\nSo a medium sized company will\noften fall into this type B\n\n190\n00:08:25.652 --> 00:08:29.832\narea where they will take risk as\nlong as they can justify it somehow.\n\n191\n00:08:29.832 --> 00:08:32.781\nAnd if they choose to take the risk\nthey've already got the corporate skills\n\n192\n00:08:32.781 --> 00:08:35.005\nand culture to be able to take\nadvantage of that, right?\n\n193\n00:08:35.005 --> 00:08:37.680\nSmall companies don't normally have\nthe corporate skills to do that.\n\n194\n00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.932\nA medium size or larger would.\n\n195\n00:08:39.932 --> 00:08:43.912\nSo what they need is a solution for\na problem.\n\n196\n00:08:43.912 --> 00:08:47.253\nAnd their problem doesn't\ncome from management.\n\n197\n00:08:47.253 --> 00:08:49.386\nIn this case their problem is actually\ncoming from the bottom of the company.\n\n198\n00:08:49.386 --> 00:08:51.865\nIt's coming from the workers,\nand the SYS admins, and\n\n199\n00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:54.152\nthe people who are running\nthis software package.\n\n200\n00:08:54.152 --> 00:08:57.386\nAnd they come and they say,\nlook we have a problem with storage.\n\n201\n00:08:57.386 --> 00:09:01.331\nWe have our servers and they all\nhave independent storage arrays or\n\n202\n00:09:01.331 --> 00:09:04.369\nwe might have SANS,\nstorage area networks setup.\n\n203\n00:09:04.369 --> 00:09:06.150\nAnd there's different vendors and\n\n204\n00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:09.600\nit's not mixed while it's becoming\nvery difficult to manage that.\n\n205\n00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.493\nSo we need to find some better\nway to manage the storage for\n\n206\n00:09:12.493 --> 00:09:16.232\nour data center, before we grow so\nlarge that it becomes unmanageable and\n\n207\n00:09:16.232 --> 00:09:18.906\nwe ultimately have some kind\nof failure as a result.\n\n208\n00:09:18.906 --> 00:09:23.293\nSo, they need to think about solutions\nthat could take care of the storage\n\n209\n00:09:23.293 --> 00:09:26.282\nproblem, that align with\ntheir business goals.\n\n210\n00:09:26.282 --> 00:09:27.128\nThat's really important.\n\n211\n00:09:27.128 --> 00:09:31.348\nAny solution, any emerging technology that\nwe adopt should somehow contribute to our\n\n212\n00:09:31.348 --> 00:09:32.224\nbusiness goals.\n\n213\n00:09:32.224 --> 00:09:34.315\nAnd Rite Inspection Software?\n\n214\n00:09:34.315 --> 00:09:35.922\nHas four simple goals, right?\n\n215\n00:09:35.922 --> 00:09:37.780\nThese are things they print,\nthey stick on their wall,\n\n216\n00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.172\nit's on the back of their business card.\n\n217\n00:09:39.172 --> 00:09:41.317\nThese are the goals they attest to.\n\n218\n00:09:41.317 --> 00:09:43.605\nOne they wanna delight their customers,\nright?\n\n219\n00:09:43.605 --> 00:09:46.433\nWhen customers use their software they\nshould be happy to use it, right?\n\n220\n00:09:46.433 --> 00:09:47.116\nIt shouldn't be an uncomfortable.\n\n221\n00:09:47.116 --> 00:09:48.553\n&gt;&gt; I like that one.\n[LAUGH]\n\n222\n00:09:48.553 --> 00:09:49.556\n&gt;&gt; Like any government website.\n\n223\n00:09:49.556 --> 00:09:51.113\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So [LAUGH]\n\n224\n00:09:51.113 --> 00:09:53.259\n&gt;&gt; It should be a pleasure to use.\n\n225\n00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:56.739\nTwo, they wanna seek innovative\nsolutions to promise, right?\n\n226\n00:09:56.739 --> 00:09:58.013\nThey don't mind taking a risk.\n\n227\n00:09:58.013 --> 00:10:00.855\nThey don't mind thinking outside\nof the box to find a solution, so\n\n228\n00:10:00.855 --> 00:10:03.871\nthat makes them a good candidate for\nselecting emerging technology.\n\n229\n00:10:03.871 --> 00:10:06.534\nThey wanna foster a positive\nwork environment.\n\n230\n00:10:06.534 --> 00:10:07.271\nAll right?\n\n231\n00:10:07.271 --> 00:10:10.257\nSo any storage solution that I find\nshould be making people's jobs better.\n\n232\n00:10:10.257 --> 00:10:11.424\nWhere it's not a misery for\n\n233\n00:10:11.424 --> 00:10:14.076\nthem to have to deal with the storage\narrays that are in place.\n\n234\n00:10:14.076 --> 00:10:15.687\nIt should be pleasant for them.\n\n235\n00:10:15.687 --> 00:10:18.468\nAnd it should improve\nefficiencies in all procedures.\n\n236\n00:10:18.468 --> 00:10:20.780\nNow, when we're talking\nabout technology hardware?\n\n237\n00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.801\nThis is probably the easiest one to meet.\n\n238\n00:10:22.801 --> 00:10:26.329\nIf we can make people more efficient,\nif they can deploy storage or\n\n239\n00:10:26.329 --> 00:10:29.983\nwork with disks, if queries on\na database run faster because storage\n\n240\n00:10:29.983 --> 00:10:33.648\nwas apportioned a different way,\nthat's an easy thing to measure.\n\n241\n00:10:33.648 --> 00:10:36.077\nAnd that goal we'll find is one\nof the easiest to align with.\n\n242\n00:10:36.077 --> 00:10:40.068\nBut, ideally we'll align\nwith more than one goal.\n\n243\n00:10:40.068 --> 00:10:43.535\nAnd that's how we know we've got a perfect\nfit when we have a solution that meets\n\n244\n00:10:43.535 --> 00:10:44.119\nthat model.\n\n245\n00:10:44.119 --> 00:10:46.256\nIf we just meet one goal though,\nthat's enough, but\n\n246\n00:10:46.256 --> 00:10:48.311\nin a perfect world we'd\nlike to have a little more.\n\n247\n00:10:48.311 --> 00:10:49.852\nSo, these are the goals and\n\n248\n00:10:49.852 --> 00:10:53.948\nat first glance they might not look\nlike IT goals, but they are, right?\n\n249\n00:10:53.948 --> 00:10:56.064\nReally all of this can be applied to IT.\n\n250\n00:10:56.064 --> 00:10:57.710\nWe want to delight our customers.\n\n251\n00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:02.089\nWell, every second that your software is\nup and working delights your customer.\n\n252\n00:11:02.089 --> 00:11:03.539\nEvery moment your software is down and\n\n253\n00:11:03.539 --> 00:11:05.454\nnot working makes your\ncustomer pretty unhappy.\n\n254\n00:11:05.454 --> 00:11:06.222\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it does.\n\n255\n00:11:06.222 --> 00:11:08.569\n&gt;&gt; So IT has a great way of\naffecting the customer right there.\n\n256\n00:11:08.569 --> 00:11:10.673\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And [LAUGH] so,\n\n257\n00:11:10.673 --> 00:11:13.496\nthat puts it into an IT perspective.\n\n258\n00:11:13.496 --> 00:11:17.091\nNow, the solution they're looking for\nis storage.\n\n259\n00:11:17.091 --> 00:11:20.912\nAnd if you do any searching out\nthere on the Internet for storage,\n\n260\n00:11:20.912 --> 00:11:25.584\nyou'll find that the current buzzword\nof the day Is software defined storage.\n\n261\n00:11:25.584 --> 00:11:28.359\nAnd actually it's software defined\nnetworking, software defined anything.\n\n262\n00:11:28.359 --> 00:11:28.996\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n263\n00:11:28.996 --> 00:11:32.565\n&gt;&gt; It's really, you'll see some\npeople are SDX, software defined x,\n\n264\n00:11:32.565 --> 00:11:33.966\ncuz you could do whatever.\n\n265\n00:11:33.966 --> 00:11:38.629\nThis is a new technology that is out that\na lot of companies are evaluating right\n\n266\n00:11:38.629 --> 00:11:42.457\nnow, a lot of companies have\nalready gone with it and selected.\n\n267\n00:11:42.457 --> 00:11:44.048\nBut for a medium sized company.\n\n268\n00:11:44.048 --> 00:11:47.486\nA company that's still managing their\nmoney frugally trying to reinvest in\n\n269\n00:11:47.486 --> 00:11:50.990\nthe company, this could be a big financial\nrisk because it can be expensive.\n\n270\n00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:55.884\nAnd with software defined networking the\nidea is that instead of managing all of\n\n271\n00:11:55.884 --> 00:12:01.010\nyour storage hardware individually, you\ncan have some kind of centralized face.\n\n272\n00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:04.461\nA centralized software that\nmanages all of the storage.\n\n273\n00:12:04.461 --> 00:12:09.256\nSo when I wanna assign 2TB of storage to\na database server, I don't really care\n\n274\n00:12:09.256 --> 00:12:14.212\nwhat hardware Raid it's on whether it's\nRaid 5 or Raid 3 or anything like that.\n\n275\n00:12:14.212 --> 00:12:16.115\nI'm not worried about that.\n\n276\n00:12:16.115 --> 00:12:20.879\nI just go in and I say give me 2TB\nstorage, stick it on the server.\n\n277\n00:12:20.879 --> 00:12:25.048\nAnd the software defined storage handles\nthat for us software defined networking is\n\n278\n00:12:25.048 --> 00:12:28.407\nvery similar for defining network and\nso we see this in other areas.\n\n279\n00:12:28.407 --> 00:12:33.370\nIf you've ever deployed anything on\nAmazon web services or Microsoft Azure,\n\n280\n00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:37.366\nthose cloud technologies they\nuse software defined storage.\n\n281\n00:12:37.366 --> 00:12:41.279\nYou say I wanna speed up a virtual machine\nwith 2TB of storage you have no idea what\n\n282\n00:12:41.279 --> 00:12:42.328\nidea is underneath.\n\n283\n00:12:42.328 --> 00:12:45.550\nThat makes you more efficient, it makes\nyou able to deploy storage more quickly\n\n284\n00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:47.968\nbecause you're not worried\nabout what's under the hood.\n\n285\n00:12:47.968 --> 00:12:51.471\nAnd from a purchaser perspective,\nit makes it easier to purchase hardware.\n\n286\n00:12:51.471 --> 00:12:54.552\nBecause you can have a mixture of\nhardware, you can go with the better\n\n287\n00:12:54.552 --> 00:12:58.274\npriced hardware and not have to stay with\none ecosystem, because there's a single\n\n288\n00:12:58.274 --> 00:13:01.062\nmanagement interface that's\ncontrolling the whole thing.\n\n289\n00:13:01.062 --> 00:13:04.603\nNow, this is not something that\nyour CEO is gonna think of.\n\n290\n00:13:04.603 --> 00:13:08.529\nThe CEO is not sitting there going, I wish\nwe could apportion storage much more,\n\n291\n00:13:08.529 --> 00:13:09.060\nyou know?\n\n292\n00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:10.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n293\n00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.164\n&gt;&gt; In most companies you're\nnot gonna have that, right?\n\n294\n00:13:12.164 --> 00:13:15.491\nThey're thinking,\nhow can we improve our bottom line?\n\n295\n00:13:15.491 --> 00:13:17.559\nWhat is our current P&amp;L?\n\n296\n00:13:17.559 --> 00:13:20.070\nThat's what's CEO's typically worry about.\n\n297\n00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:23.470\nSo this is the type of thing that gets\ndriven from the bottom of the company.\n\n298\n00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:24.557\nFrom the actual workers.\n\n299\n00:13:24.557 --> 00:13:26.098\nThe people who are in the field,\n\n300\n00:13:26.098 --> 00:13:29.541\nwho are doing what's needing to be\ndone to create the product, right?\n\n301\n00:13:29.541 --> 00:13:31.731\nAnd that's where you'll oftentimes\nfind where these emerging\n\n302\n00:13:31.731 --> 00:13:32.628\ntechnologies come from.\n\n303\n00:13:32.628 --> 00:13:36.313\nBecause it might not be on our radar as\na manager, or as a C-level executive.\n\n304\n00:13:36.313 --> 00:13:39.469\nIt might not be on our radar, but\nto the people actually doing the work,\n\n305\n00:13:39.469 --> 00:13:41.955\nthey hear about these technologies and\nare like, man.\n\n306\n00:13:41.955 --> 00:13:44.357\nIt sure would be great if I had that.\n\n307\n00:13:44.357 --> 00:13:48.490\nThen we want to aim to improve\noperating efficiency, right?\n\n308\n00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:50.583\nHow can they make their job easier?\n\n309\n00:13:50.583 --> 00:13:52.057\nHow can they get things done faster?\n\n310\n00:13:52.057 --> 00:13:54.560\nBecause the faster they can\nget things done, either one,\n\n311\n00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.371\nit makes our customers happy\nbecause it got done faster, or two,\n\n312\n00:13:57.371 --> 00:13:59.895\nit makes this where we can\nhandle more customers, right?\n\n313\n00:13:59.895 --> 00:14:01.088\nWhich would really be ideal.\n\n314\n00:14:01.088 --> 00:14:02.523\nYou grow the business that way.\n\n315\n00:14:02.523 --> 00:14:04.228\nYou need to have scalability.\n\n316\n00:14:04.228 --> 00:14:07.012\nSo when we deploy something\nlike software defined network,\n\n317\n00:14:07.012 --> 00:14:10.177\nwe got to make sure that it meets\nthese requirements that it does these\n\n318\n00:14:10.177 --> 00:14:12.869\nthings to help improve our business,\nour business case.\n\n319\n00:14:12.869 --> 00:14:14.722\nHopefully we can reduce\nour operating costs.\n\n320\n00:14:14.722 --> 00:14:17.360\n&gt;&gt; That's a big one, that's a nice\nselling point right there right?\n\n321\n00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.789\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Especially when you're\n\n322\n00:14:18.789 --> 00:14:19.398\ntalking storage right?\n\n323\n00:14:19.398 --> 00:14:20.785\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because it can get expensive, and\n\n324\n00:14:20.785 --> 00:14:22.637\nwhen you're managing so\nmany different devices.\n\n325\n00:14:22.637 --> 00:14:26.899\nYou've gotta have training, you've gotta\nhave warranties with different providers.\n\n326\n00:14:26.899 --> 00:14:29.897\nIt does become a big cost.\n\n327\n00:14:29.897 --> 00:14:34.986\nAnd then lastly, if we deploy with a cloud\ntechnology like Microsoft Azure or\n\n328\n00:14:34.986 --> 00:14:37.034\nAmazon AWS, with those guys.\n\n329\n00:14:37.034 --> 00:14:39.964\nThere's certain redundancies that you get,\nright?\n\n330\n00:14:39.964 --> 00:14:43.754\nIf I have a storage appliance right here\nin the building with me I need a UPS,\n\n331\n00:14:43.754 --> 00:14:46.957\nit needs battery power so\nit can still run when the power is out.\n\n332\n00:14:46.957 --> 00:14:50.741\nI need a backup generator, if the power\noutage is a long one the battery doesn't\n\n333\n00:14:50.741 --> 00:14:52.900\nlast very long so\nI need a generator to run it.\n\n334\n00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:57.380\nI need physical security, I need all sorts\nof different thing like that that I would\n\n335\n00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.240\nhave to pay for in their entirety.\n\n336\n00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.034\nBut when you go with a cloud provider,\n\n337\n00:15:01.034 --> 00:15:04.469\nyou're sharing that cost across all\nthe cloud provider's customers.\n\n338\n00:15:04.469 --> 00:15:08.206\nAnd they'll have generators and UPSs,\nthey'll have redundant networks,\n\n339\n00:15:08.206 --> 00:15:12.174\nthey'll have a network operation center\nthat's monitoring the equipment, and\n\n340\n00:15:12.174 --> 00:15:13.624\nyou just pay a small portion.\n\n341\n00:15:13.624 --> 00:15:17.385\nSo not only do you reduce cost,\nbut you increase benefit.\n\n342\n00:15:17.385 --> 00:15:21.374\nYou get a much more stable architecture\nby going with something like this,\n\n343\n00:15:21.374 --> 00:15:24.049\nif you can, if it's a right fit for\nyour company.\n\n344\n00:15:24.049 --> 00:15:28.030\nSo this is the scenario company that I'm\ngonna use as we run through the street\n\n345\n00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:29.387\nprocess in this episode.\n\n346\n00:15:29.387 --> 00:15:33.077\nSo Rite Inspection Software is looking\nat software defined networking.\n\n347\n00:15:33.077 --> 00:15:35.744\nAnd then trying to figure out whether or\nnot it's right for them and\n\n348\n00:15:35.744 --> 00:15:36.847\nwhat they're going to do.\n\n349\n00:15:36.847 --> 00:15:37.406\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don.\n\n350\n00:15:37.406 --> 00:15:40.926\nSo I guess that leaves the question\nof what do we do in the scope step?\n\n351\n00:15:40.926 --> 00:15:43.168\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nSo the scope step is the very first step\n\n352\n00:15:43.168 --> 00:15:44.695\ninside of the STREET process.\n\n353\n00:15:44.695 --> 00:15:46.074\nSTREET is an acronym, right?\n\n354\n00:15:46.074 --> 00:15:49.413\nSo we'll go through S, T, R,\nE, E, T, that's the SCOPE,\n\n355\n00:15:49.413 --> 00:15:53.555\nand with scope we're not even really\nthinking about the solution just yet.\n\n356\n00:15:53.555 --> 00:15:55.330\nWe're thinking about us as a company,\nright?\n\n357\n00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:58.987\nWe're thinking about our business needs,\nwhat do we need to get things done, right?\n\n358\n00:15:58.987 --> 00:16:02.591\nSo, the official governor\ndefinition here for scope is.\n\n359\n00:16:02.591 --> 00:16:07.803\nWe provide a business focus and context\nfor emerging technology investments\n\n360\n00:16:07.803 --> 00:16:12.224\nby identifying what organizational\npurposes should be served.\n\n361\n00:16:12.224 --> 00:16:15.749\nSo notice here it's not saying we\nwanna find an emerging technology.\n\n362\n00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:19.493\nIt's saying we want to create\na context for an emerging technology.\n\n363\n00:16:19.493 --> 00:16:24.239\nWe need to come up with a list of business\nneeds that an emerging technology\n\n364\n00:16:24.239 --> 00:16:25.319\ncould address.\n\n365\n00:16:25.319 --> 00:16:27.410\nAnd that technology might not exist.\n\n366\n00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:31.047\nI might have five needs, and no one\ntechnology that addresses those needs.\n\n367\n00:16:31.047 --> 00:16:33.210\nBut as I hear about new technologies,\n\n368\n00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:36.466\nI might find one that addresses\nthe first two of my needs.\n\n369\n00:16:36.466 --> 00:16:39.358\nThe other three are still left open,\nso I'll have to keep looking,\n\n370\n00:16:39.358 --> 00:16:41.155\nbut I might not find one perfect product.\n\n371\n00:16:41.155 --> 00:16:44.594\nIt may be several products combined,\nthat meet all of my needs.\n\n372\n00:16:44.594 --> 00:16:47.527\nBut I need to know what my needs\nare before we get started.\n\n373\n00:16:47.527 --> 00:16:50.610\nThere's a lot of businesses\nthat make a big mistake here.\n\n374\n00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:55.196\nWhich is deploying a technology just for\nthe sake of having that technology.\n\n375\n00:16:55.196 --> 00:16:58.119\nWe need to actually have a business need\nfor, it needs to improve us somehow.\n\n376\n00:16:58.119 --> 00:17:01.953\nWe don't wanna just look flashy and-\n&gt;&gt; It gives us something to do,\n\n377\n00:17:01.953 --> 00:17:02.652\nDon [LAUGH].\n\n378\n00:17:02.652 --> 00:17:04.327\n&gt;&gt; There's something to be\nsaid about bragging rights.\n\n379\n00:17:04.327 --> 00:17:07.196\nMaybe we just need to brag\nabout having some technology.\n\n380\n00:17:07.196 --> 00:17:09.223\nBut maybe that's our need then.\n\n381\n00:17:09.223 --> 00:17:13.159\nWe have a marketing need to say that we-\n&gt;&gt; Are on the bleeding edge.\n\n382\n00:17:13.159 --> 00:17:15.164\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat we launched our product into space.\n\n383\n00:17:15.164 --> 00:17:16.946\nIt might not actually serve\nour customers at all.\n\n384\n00:17:16.946 --> 00:17:19.510\nBut we do it anyway cuz you get some\nmarketing, there might be a need there.\n\n385\n00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:23.749\nFor Right Inspection Software,\nthey're doing home inspection software.\n\n386\n00:17:23.749 --> 00:17:25.456\nSo, what are their business needs?\n\n387\n00:17:25.456 --> 00:17:29.244\nWell maybe they've identified a problem\nthat whenever they sign on a new\n\n388\n00:17:29.244 --> 00:17:33.173\ncustomer they have to deploy a virtual\nserver and that process takes a day.\n\n389\n00:17:33.173 --> 00:17:37.549\nSo, you get a brand-new customer who's\nsigning up that's hot to trot ready to\n\n390\n00:17:37.549 --> 00:17:38.215\nget going.\n\n391\n00:17:38.215 --> 00:17:40.487\nAnd they have to wait 24 hours\nbefore they can get started.\n\n392\n00:17:40.487 --> 00:17:42.098\nThat puts a cooldown.\n\n393\n00:17:42.098 --> 00:17:45.180\nSo wouldn't it be nice if\nsomebody could sign up for\n\n394\n00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:48.272\ntheir product and\nbe ready to go instantaneously.\n\n395\n00:17:48.272 --> 00:17:51.999\nIf we could already have a virtual server\nwith storage all deployed ready to\n\n396\n00:17:51.999 --> 00:17:52.708\ngo and there,\n\n397\n00:17:52.708 --> 00:17:56.570\nas soon as they put their credit card\ninformation in they're ready to start.\n\n398\n00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:57.981\nThat would be great.\n\n399\n00:17:57.981 --> 00:18:00.217\nThat would improve the customer happiness.\n\n400\n00:18:00.217 --> 00:18:01.860\nIt would improve our bottom line.\n\n401\n00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.780\nIt would make things more efficient.\n\n402\n00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:06.075\nIt would really be a great thing to have,\nbut\n\n403\n00:18:06.075 --> 00:18:08.505\nwe don't have those\ncapabilities right now.\n\n404\n00:18:08.505 --> 00:18:11.393\nSo we're looking for those needs and\nkind of building them out and\n\n405\n00:18:11.393 --> 00:18:13.873\nfiguring out what we've got\nto have in place to do that.\n\n406\n00:18:13.873 --> 00:18:17.656\n&gt;&gt; Makes me think of Amazon, how\nthe two-day Prime shipping, amazing stuff.\n\n407\n00:18:17.656 --> 00:18:18.225\nEverybody loves it.\n\n408\n00:18:18.225 --> 00:18:22.119\nBut there's still that part of me\nthat says I'd like to have it today,\n\n409\n00:18:22.119 --> 00:18:25.233\nso they started coming out\nwith that same day shipping.\n\n410\n00:18:25.233 --> 00:18:27.579\nGetting it in the exact same\nday in certain cities, and\n\n411\n00:18:27.579 --> 00:18:29.724\nthey are continually\nexpanding that operation.\n\n412\n00:18:29.724 --> 00:18:31.078\nHopefully, one day it\nwill come to my city.\n\n413\n00:18:31.078 --> 00:18:31.783\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n414\n00:18:31.783 --> 00:18:32.924\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure it will.\n\n415\n00:18:32.924 --> 00:18:36.883\nBut, is that the same kind of idea,\nwhere they saw that need and\n\n416\n00:18:36.883 --> 00:18:38.993\nused the scope, can you do that?\n\n417\n00:18:38.993 --> 00:18:42.065\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, you're looking for\na need that you have as a company.\n\n418\n00:18:42.065 --> 00:18:45.339\nNow, you mentioned a need\nthat a customer might have,\n\n419\n00:18:45.339 --> 00:18:47.484\na customer might want that faster.\n\n420\n00:18:47.484 --> 00:18:52.045\nNow, the customers want becomes our want\nif we want to keep that customer, so\n\n421\n00:18:52.045 --> 00:18:53.319\nit's easy to get in.\n\n422\n00:18:53.319 --> 00:18:57.070\nAnd in this case of software defined\nnetworking, or software defined storaging,\n\n423\n00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:59.333\nI said that it came from\nthe bottom of the company.\n\n424\n00:18:59.333 --> 00:19:01.399\nIt came from the employees wanting it.\n\n425\n00:19:01.399 --> 00:19:03.479\nIn your example,\nit came from the customer.\n\n426\n00:19:03.479 --> 00:19:06.241\nSometimes, the customer will tell\nyou what your business need is.\n\n427\n00:19:06.241 --> 00:19:08.465\nAnd if you choose to meet it,\nyou stay relevant,\n\n428\n00:19:08.465 --> 00:19:10.163\nyou stay dominant in your category.\n\n429\n00:19:10.163 --> 00:19:12.737\nAnd if you choose not to meet it,\nsomebody else will.\n\n430\n00:19:12.737 --> 00:19:14.365\nAnd now you've missed out.\n\n431\n00:19:14.365 --> 00:19:18.252\nSo having that scope is a big thing, that\nwe need to constantly be living in it.\n\n432\n00:19:18.252 --> 00:19:23.639\nThat it evolves, we add to it, we change\nour scope as our business changes.\n\n433\n00:19:23.639 --> 00:19:25.281\nIt's not something that's\nchiseled in stone.\n\n434\n00:19:25.281 --> 00:19:25.832\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n435\n00:19:25.832 --> 00:19:27.660\n&gt;&gt; This is the one thing that we do.\n\n436\n00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:28.588\nSo that's important.\n\n437\n00:19:28.588 --> 00:19:32.854\nNow as a part of this process, we're\nhaving to evaluate a lot of that data,\n\n438\n00:19:32.854 --> 00:19:34.840\nto figure out what all is going on.\n\n439\n00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:38.828\nAnd there's a number of other different\ntechniques that get put in place here,\n\n440\n00:19:38.828 --> 00:19:41.998\nas this is getting done,\nthings like a competitive analysis.\n\n441\n00:19:41.998 --> 00:19:44.654\nLook at what is your competition doing?\n\n442\n00:19:44.654 --> 00:19:46.144\nIf you were to use this technology,\n\n443\n00:19:46.144 --> 00:19:48.338\nhow would it make you better\nthan your competition?\n\n444\n00:19:48.338 --> 00:19:52.267\nWould you be more competitive if you had\nthis particular technology deployed,\n\n445\n00:19:52.267 --> 00:19:53.448\nversus if you didn't.\n\n446\n00:19:53.448 --> 00:19:54.952\nSo competitive analysis.\n\n447\n00:19:54.952 --> 00:19:56.680\nThere's visioning.\n\n448\n00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.107\nWhat do you see it being like?\n\n449\n00:19:58.107 --> 00:20:01.970\nIf your company deploys this technology\nfor Right Software Incorporated,\n\n450\n00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:06.031\nif they have software designed storage,\nwhat's that gonna look like to them?\n\n451\n00:20:06.031 --> 00:20:09.902\nWill they be able to deploy\na customer solution in five minutes,\n\n452\n00:20:09.902 --> 00:20:11.487\nas opposed to 24 hours?\n\n453\n00:20:11.487 --> 00:20:14.950\nBecause if so that would be great,\nthat would be an amazing thing.\n\n454\n00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:17.737\nBut, we have to have a vision of\nwhat that solution will be like.\n\n455\n00:20:17.737 --> 00:20:20.863\nThen we need scenario building.\n\n456\n00:20:20.863 --> 00:20:23.743\nHow are our end users going to\nmake use of this technology?\n\n457\n00:20:23.743 --> 00:20:27.199\nWhen they actually have it in place,\nwhat's the scenario look like?\n\n458\n00:20:27.199 --> 00:20:28.233\nHow will we go through?\n\n459\n00:20:28.233 --> 00:20:30.569\nDoes it actually look better?\n\n460\n00:20:30.569 --> 00:20:34.276\nAnd you'll find that a lot of technologies\nhave a marketing slick that goes with them\n\n461\n00:20:34.276 --> 00:20:36.531\nthat says,\nthis is the greatest technology ever.\n\n462\n00:20:36.531 --> 00:20:37.768\nYou definitely need this.\n\n463\n00:20:37.768 --> 00:20:39.955\nBut what does that look like for you?\n\n464\n00:20:39.955 --> 00:20:40.904\nLet me just give you an example here.\n\n465\n00:20:40.904 --> 00:20:42.365\nI'm gonna pull up.\n\n466\n00:20:42.365 --> 00:20:44.200\nLet's pretend like we were shopping.\n\n467\n00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.237\nSoftware defined storage\ncan be really simple.\n\n468\n00:20:46.237 --> 00:20:47.926\nLike Dropbox.\n\n469\n00:20:47.926 --> 00:20:48.993\nI need storage.\n\n470\n00:20:48.993 --> 00:20:51.481\nI go and I sign up with Dropbox,\nit's I don't know, $100 a year or\n\n471\n00:20:51.481 --> 00:20:54.155\nsomething like that and then you get\na terabyte of storage and there you go.\n\n472\n00:20:54.155 --> 00:20:59.723\nBut it's not super well\ndefined what's going on here.\n\n473\n00:20:59.723 --> 00:21:03.745\nSo for example, Dropbox For Business where\nthey tell you, you get unlimited storage.\n\n474\n00:21:03.745 --> 00:21:06.902\nAll right,\nall my storage needs are now solved.\n\n475\n00:21:06.902 --> 00:21:07.777\nOr is it?\n\n476\n00:21:07.777 --> 00:21:10.027\nIf I look at my vision of\nhow I would deploy it.\n\n477\n00:21:10.027 --> 00:21:11.368\nAll right, I have a database server.\n\n478\n00:21:11.368 --> 00:21:13.697\nAnd the database server needs\ntwo terabytes of storage.\n\n479\n00:21:13.697 --> 00:21:16.210\nI can't put a database in Dropbox and\nuse it.\n\n480\n00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:17.313\nIt doesn't work that way.\n\n481\n00:21:17.313 --> 00:21:19.662\nSo I have to know how it works.\n\n482\n00:21:19.662 --> 00:21:21.622\nI have to learn a little\nmore about the product.\n\n483\n00:21:21.622 --> 00:21:23.570\nAnd if I start going to the other\nvendors that are out there.\n\n484\n00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:25.163\nIf I go to Dell.\n\n485\n00:21:25.163 --> 00:21:26.444\nWell, Dell will chat with me.\n\n486\n00:21:26.444 --> 00:21:26.987\nLet me get rid of that.\n\n487\n00:21:26.987 --> 00:21:28.244\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If I go to Dell,\n\n488\n00:21:28.244 --> 00:21:31.990\nI can transform my infrastructure\nwith software defined storage.\n\n489\n00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.409\nTransform.\n\n490\n00:21:33.409 --> 00:21:34.017\n&gt;&gt; Mm.\n\n491\n00:21:34.017 --> 00:21:34.806\n&gt;&gt; What does that even mean?\n\n492\n00:21:34.806 --> 00:21:36.445\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It means it's gonna change.\n\n493\n00:21:36.445 --> 00:21:38.241\nOf course it's gonna change,\nI'm putting something new in.\n\n494\n00:21:38.241 --> 00:21:39.830\nI don't know what that means.\n\n495\n00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:41.569\nAnd I don't know what my vision of it is.\n\n496\n00:21:41.569 --> 00:21:44.311\nIf I automate the deployment of IT\nservices, optimize IT operations,\n\n497\n00:21:44.311 --> 00:21:46.155\nthese are the things\nthat they're telling me.\n\n498\n00:21:46.155 --> 00:21:47.399\nThese are marketing terms,\nmarketing jargon.\n\n499\n00:21:47.399 --> 00:21:47.955\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n500\n00:21:47.955 --> 00:21:50.695\nwe've got to get a real\nvision of what we can do.\n\n501\n00:21:50.695 --> 00:21:51.745\nI'm not just picking on Dell.\n\n502\n00:21:51.745 --> 00:21:53.578\nIf we go to HP.\n\n503\n00:21:53.578 --> 00:21:54.719\nEliminate complexity and\n\n504\n00:21:54.719 --> 00:21:57.888\nfree your infrastructure from\nthe limitations of dedicated hardware.\n\n505\n00:21:57.888 --> 00:22:00.614\nGreat, I didn't [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Know had that problem\n\n506\n00:22:00.614 --> 00:22:01.606\n&gt;&gt; But maybe I do now.\n\n507\n00:22:01.606 --> 00:22:02.615\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n508\n00:22:02.615 --> 00:22:05.233\n&gt;&gt; Wow,\nmy OnPremises hardware is limiting me.\n\n509\n00:22:05.233 --> 00:22:07.622\nSo we need to make sure\nwe understand that.\n\n510\n00:22:07.622 --> 00:22:10.694\nIBM, renovate,\nwhat do we need to renovate.\n\n511\n00:22:10.694 --> 00:22:13.032\nRenovate your IT infrastructure\nto increase capacity and\n\n512\n00:22:13.032 --> 00:22:13.990\nreduce storage costs.\n\n513\n00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:16.198\nAll right, well,\nI can reduce storage costs, that's good.\n\n514\n00:22:16.198 --> 00:22:16.793\n&gt;&gt; That's nice.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n515\n00:22:16.793 --> 00:22:18.939\nso how is that going to look for us?\n\n516\n00:22:18.939 --> 00:22:20.139\nAnd then lastly,\n\n517\n00:22:20.139 --> 00:22:24.868\nwe can go Lenovo Revolutionize\nStorage Economics with Storeselect.\n\n518\n00:22:24.868 --> 00:22:29.619\nSo each of these vendors are really\nadvertising software to find storage.\n\n519\n00:22:29.619 --> 00:22:30.941\nBut they do it in different way.\n\n520\n00:22:30.941 --> 00:22:34.683\nEach on is a different solution, we need\nto understand what are vision of this is?\n\n521\n00:22:34.683 --> 00:22:38.282\nWhat is our perfect world if I had this\ntechnology and how would I use it?\n\n522\n00:22:38.282 --> 00:22:42.653\nAnd then I can start to figure out which\none of these guys actually most align with\n\n523\n00:22:42.653 --> 00:22:44.490\nwhat it is that I'm trying to do.\n\n524\n00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:47.231\nAnd you might find some of them\ndon't align very well at all.\n\n525\n00:22:47.231 --> 00:22:49.994\nBut if you don't even have your vision\nestablished, that's going to be a problem.\n\n526\n00:22:49.994 --> 00:22:52.735\nSo that's all a part of the scope process.\n\n527\n00:22:52.735 --> 00:22:57.119\nWe need to identify any business\nproblems and any business opportunities.\n\n528\n00:22:57.119 --> 00:23:01.322\nProblems are areas that are causing\nus pain and that we need to fix.\n\n529\n00:23:01.322 --> 00:23:02.986\nAreas that are actively hurting us.\n\n530\n00:23:02.986 --> 00:23:07.040\nOpportunities are areas that\naren't necessarily hurting us but\n\n531\n00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.447\nwe could make better.\n\n532\n00:23:08.447 --> 00:23:10.655\nMaybe my customers are already happy.\n\n533\n00:23:10.655 --> 00:23:14.911\nBut if I can make them even more\nhappy where's the value on that?\n\n534\n00:23:14.911 --> 00:23:17.034\nMight mean the customers\nstay with me longer.\n\n535\n00:23:17.034 --> 00:23:19.700\nIt may generate word of mouth or\nloyalty like you mentioned.\n\n536\n00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:24.244\nIt might bring me more customers and other\npeople see our customers are already happy\n\n537\n00:23:24.244 --> 00:23:26.612\nand we did XYZ and\nthey are now even happier.\n\n538\n00:23:26.612 --> 00:23:28.910\nMaybe people didn't mind waiting 24 hours.\n\n539\n00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:32.320\nBut when Right Software\ndeploy software find storage.\n\n540\n00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.641\nAnd now they create that customer\nenvironment in under a few minutes.\n\n541\n00:23:35.641 --> 00:23:39.743\nThat makes people even more impressed\nwith what their capabilities are.\n\n542\n00:23:39.743 --> 00:23:43.118\nThese are the things that we evaluate\nall right here during the scope step.\n\n543\n00:23:43.118 --> 00:23:47.135\n&gt;&gt; Well Don you keep using this word we,\nwe need to do this,\n\n544\n00:23:47.135 --> 00:23:48.767\nand we need to do that.\n\n545\n00:23:48.767 --> 00:23:52.867\nThat the thing kept popping into my\nmind is who exactly is the we that you\n\n546\n00:23:52.867 --> 00:23:54.012\nare referring to?\n\n547\n00:23:54.012 --> 00:23:55.717\n&gt;&gt; What's the saying it's you and\nthe mouse in your pocket or something?\n\n548\n00:23:55.717 --> 00:23:57.969\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah the mouse in your pocket that's\n\n549\n00:23:57.969 --> 00:23:58.531\nright [LAUGH].\n\n550\n00:23:58.531 --> 00:24:02.441\nSo we can be several people,\nright, at this scope step,\n\n551\n00:24:02.441 --> 00:24:05.703\nwhere this is identifying\nour business needs.\n\n552\n00:24:05.703 --> 00:24:09.278\nSome of this can come from just\nthe regular workers that are down in\n\n553\n00:24:09.278 --> 00:24:10.128\nthe trenches.\n\n554\n00:24:10.128 --> 00:24:16.778\nThis could be our customer,\n\n555\n00:24:16.778 --> 00:24:21.211\nbut a lot of times,\n\n556\n00:24:21.211 --> 00:24:27.031\norganizations will have\n\n557\n00:24:27.031 --> 00:24:32.295\nwhat is called an ETG,\n\n558\n00:24:32.295 --> 00:24:39.793\nan Emerging Technology Group.\n\n559\n00:24:39.793 --> 00:24:43.182\nAt the scope stage a lot of\nthis is already set up, and\n\n560\n00:24:43.182 --> 00:24:45.657\nwe may not even have the ETG built yet.\n\n561\n00:24:45.657 --> 00:24:47.814\nBut when we start moving\ninto the other steps,\n\n562\n00:24:47.814 --> 00:24:50.484\nit will be the ETG that actually\ndoes the bulk of the work.\n\n563\n00:24:50.484 --> 00:24:53.709\nIn the start, if I don't have an ETG,\nthis particular project,\n\n564\n00:24:53.709 --> 00:24:57.716\nthe right software group would start\nwith a software development team, right.\n\n565\n00:24:57.716 --> 00:24:59.026\nThe software development team,\n\n566\n00:24:59.026 --> 00:25:01.281\nthey're the ones who are having\nto create the software.\n\n567\n00:25:01.281 --> 00:25:03.517\nThey're the ones who are having to\ncreate these customer environments.\n\n568\n00:25:03.517 --> 00:25:06.358\nAnd they are the ones who are recognizing\nthat storage is the problem.\n\n569\n00:25:06.358 --> 00:25:11.819\nSo they find the issue, they find this\nproblem to solve and create a vision.\n\n570\n00:25:11.819 --> 00:25:16.333\nAnd then we, as a company, establish\nan ETG to then take that vision and\n\n571\n00:25:16.333 --> 00:25:17.170\nrun with it.\n\n572\n00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:21.785\nAnd run through the rest of these steps to\nfind the right solution, get it deployed,\n\n573\n00:25:21.785 --> 00:25:23.543\nand then move on to the next one.\n\n574\n00:25:23.543 --> 00:25:27.572\nSo an emerging technology group is really\nthe group of people who are gonna do that.\n\n575\n00:25:27.572 --> 00:25:31.979\n&gt;&gt; All right, so once we've established\nour need, how do we pick a solution?\n\n576\n00:25:31.979 --> 00:25:34.740\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nwhen it comes to picking a solution,\n\n577\n00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:37.645\nthis is where things get\na little bit tricky, right.\n\n578\n00:25:37.645 --> 00:25:42.908\nWhat we need to do is move into the track\nstep, and in the track step, what we're\n\n579\n00:25:42.908 --> 00:25:47.875\ndoing is seeking out relevant technologies\nfrom a broad range of sources.\n\n580\n00:25:47.875 --> 00:25:51.342\nNow, that broad range of\nsources is really important,\n\n581\n00:25:51.342 --> 00:25:56.226\nI might have a meeting with a Dell rep,\nthe Dell rep comes to the office one day.\n\n582\n00:25:56.226 --> 00:25:58.610\nAnd says, let me show you what we got,\nthis is amazing, and\n\n583\n00:25:58.610 --> 00:25:59.720\nthey show you technology.\n\n584\n00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:04.248\nYou're just blown away it aligns with all\nof your business needs, it's perfect for\n\n585\n00:26:04.248 --> 00:26:05.478\nwhat you want, okay.\n\n586\n00:26:05.478 --> 00:26:08.579\nYou could stop right there and say,\nI'm just gonna run with this one, sold.\n\n587\n00:26:08.579 --> 00:26:11.734\nBut just because one vendor has this\nperfect solution that you've been\n\n588\n00:26:11.734 --> 00:26:15.153\npresented with right on day one doesn't\nmean that somebody else isn't doing\n\n589\n00:26:15.153 --> 00:26:15.693\nit better.\n\n590\n00:26:15.693 --> 00:26:19.759\nYou need to evaluate the other\nsolutions that are out there, and so\n\n591\n00:26:19.759 --> 00:26:24.704\nin the track phase, this is where we're\nactually looking for other solutions.\n\n592\n00:26:24.704 --> 00:26:27.836\nAnd we might not even have a specific\nproblem in mind yet, we do here in\n\n593\n00:26:27.836 --> 00:26:31.570\nthis example, and we know exactly what\nwe're looking for, but maybe we don't.\n\n594\n00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:35.384\nMaybe we went through the scope, and\nwe came up with our business needs, and\n\n595\n00:26:35.384 --> 00:26:39.755\nnow we've just got a whole list of needs,\nand I wonder what's out there, right?\n\n596\n00:26:39.755 --> 00:26:43.482\nAnd so, we go into track, now we're\nseeking out stuff, we may not have a clue,\n\n597\n00:26:43.482 --> 00:26:45.948\nright, and we just wanna go out and\nfind something.\n\n598\n00:26:45.948 --> 00:26:49.711\nWell, when you're seeking\nout those technologies,\n\n599\n00:26:49.711 --> 00:26:53.572\nyou can be presented with\na lot of crazy things, right?\n\n600\n00:26:53.572 --> 00:26:57.391\nSome that are really mature, that are\ngreat products that are ready to deploy,\n\n601\n00:26:57.391 --> 00:27:00.185\nlike Dell, anything they sell\nwould be a mature product.\n\n602\n00:27:00.185 --> 00:27:02.868\nBut there's a lot of stuff you\nmight find on Kickstarter,\n\n603\n00:27:02.868 --> 00:27:06.943\nor Indiegogo, right, that's non-mature,\nthat you don't know, it's a big risk.\n\n604\n00:27:06.943 --> 00:27:08.042\nAnd so for those,\n\n605\n00:27:08.042 --> 00:27:12.528\nwe end up having to be really careful\nwith what's called the hype cycle.\n\n606\n00:27:12.528 --> 00:27:15.518\nThe hype cycle is kind of\nshown here in this chart, and\n\n607\n00:27:15.518 --> 00:27:17.650\nI know it's a little bit hard to read.\n\n608\n00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:24.842\nBut every emerging technology goes\nthrough a series of phases, the cycle.\n\n609\n00:27:24.842 --> 00:27:29.252\nAnd the cycle kind of shows almost really\nthe level of risk we would have if we\n\n610\n00:27:29.252 --> 00:27:31.356\ndeployed the technology, right?\n\n611\n00:27:31.356 --> 00:27:33.066\nSo let's kinda run\nthrough this real quick,\n\n612\n00:27:33.066 --> 00:27:35.417\nwe start with what's called\nan innovation trigger, right?\n\n613\n00:27:35.417 --> 00:27:39.272\nSomebody has an idea, there's a problem,\nI'm gonna fix it, right, what is it,\n\n614\n00:27:39.272 --> 00:27:41.328\nis it see a need and\nfill it, the old saying?\n\n615\n00:27:41.328 --> 00:27:44.634\nSo somebody sees a need and they fill it,\nthey come up with a solution,\n\n616\n00:27:44.634 --> 00:27:45.765\nnow that's just them.\n\n617\n00:27:45.765 --> 00:27:50.174\nThis is like Steve Jobs and\nSteve Wozniak back in the garage,\n\n618\n00:27:50.174 --> 00:27:54.849\nit's just a small organization,\nthey come up with a solution.\n\n619\n00:27:54.849 --> 00:27:59.960\nAnd then they start to promote it and\nget the word out that, hey, we got this\n\n620\n00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:05.419\nnew solution, you really want it, and\nyou've got this build up that happens.\n\n621\n00:28:05.419 --> 00:28:10.633\nThis whole build up to what's called\nthe peak of inflated expectations.\n\n622\n00:28:10.633 --> 00:28:12.947\nIf you don't have something in your hand,\n\n623\n00:28:12.947 --> 00:28:16.373\nit's easy in your mind to build it\nup to be more than it would be.\n\n624\n00:28:16.373 --> 00:28:19.504\nAnd what happens when you\nfinally get it in your hands,\n\n625\n00:28:19.504 --> 00:28:21.829\nyou get the trough of disillusionment.\n\n626\n00:28:21.829 --> 00:28:24.801\n&gt;&gt; I like that, it sounds like a metal\nalbum title or something [LAUGH].\n\n627\n00:28:24.801 --> 00:28:29.203\n&gt;&gt; It really does, but it's a great\nway to describe what happens, though.\n\n628\n00:28:29.203 --> 00:28:32.359\nBecause in your mind you,\nbuild this up as being perfect, and\n\n629\n00:28:32.359 --> 00:28:34.984\nthen as soon as you get it,\nboy, it's not as good.\n\n630\n00:28:34.984 --> 00:28:38.920\nAnd if you've ever preordered anything, if\nyou've done a Kickstarter, this happens.\n\n631\n00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:42.516\nAnd as a company if you say, you know\nwhat, what if I just waited, what if I\n\n632\n00:28:42.516 --> 00:28:46.413\nwaited, and yeah, everybody was hyping\nthis up to be the greatest thing ever.\n\n633\n00:28:46.413 --> 00:28:49.274\nAnd so by the time we hit the peak,\nboy it was the greatest, and\n\n634\n00:28:49.274 --> 00:28:53.125\nthen if I just waited, and let some people\npurchase it and then post some reviews and\n\n635\n00:28:53.125 --> 00:28:54.627\nthings, I could have learned.\n\n636\n00:28:54.627 --> 00:28:59.018\nAnd it drops way down here, and now we\nget what's actually a little bit below\n\n637\n00:28:59.018 --> 00:29:02.392\nreality, what is really\nthe experience of this product.\n\n638\n00:29:02.392 --> 00:29:05.322\nAnd then after a little while,\nwe get the scope of enlightenment,\n\n639\n00:29:05.322 --> 00:29:08.532\nand scope of enlightenment is,\nwe understand what this product can do.\n\n640\n00:29:08.532 --> 00:29:12.133\nWe understand what its limitations are,\nwhat it's actually capable of,\n\n641\n00:29:12.133 --> 00:29:14.316\nwhat our benefits could\nbe if we deployed it.\n\n642\n00:29:14.316 --> 00:29:18.560\nAnd from there, we can move into what's\ncall the plateau of productivity,\n\n643\n00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:19.568\nthis last stage.\n\n644\n00:29:19.568 --> 00:29:23.187\nAnd this is where we can\nactually use the technology and\n\n645\n00:29:23.187 --> 00:29:27.286\nget the most benefit out of it,\nwith the right expectations.\n\n646\n00:29:27.286 --> 00:29:30.259\nNow, the challenge with all of this,\nbecause it seems easy, you're like,\n\n647\n00:29:30.259 --> 00:29:31.470\nI don't need a chart for this.\n\n648\n00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:34.023\nI'll just wait for\nthe plateau of productivity,\n\n649\n00:29:34.023 --> 00:29:35.736\nthat's where I'll buy things.\n\n650\n00:29:35.736 --> 00:29:39.106\nThe problem is,\nif you can identify something early,\n\n651\n00:29:39.106 --> 00:29:42.986\nif I know it's going to make it\nto the plateau of productivity,\n\n652\n00:29:42.986 --> 00:29:47.454\nI could get in way early, back in\nthe peak of inflated expectations, and\n\n653\n00:29:47.454 --> 00:29:50.854\nactually benefit, and\nmy competition might do that.\n\n654\n00:29:50.854 --> 00:29:54.590\nI don't want to ignore a technology too\nlong and my competition gets in there and\n\n655\n00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:56.727\ngets the business\nadvantage out of it first.\n\n656\n00:29:56.727 --> 00:29:59.682\nSo we don't want to ignore\ntechnologies early on, but\n\n657\n00:29:59.682 --> 00:30:04.001\nwe want to make sure we understand where\nthey're at in this hype cycle, right?\n\n658\n00:30:04.001 --> 00:30:08.098\nIf I see a solution, and I know that it\nhas not hit the peak of its expectations\n\n659\n00:30:08.098 --> 00:30:10.018\nyet, if it's not fully inflated,\n\n660\n00:30:10.018 --> 00:30:14.451\nthen I know that there's definitely gonna\nbe some disappointment down the road.\n\n661\n00:30:14.451 --> 00:30:18.108\nAnd as long as we build in for that, build\nthat expectation in ourselves to say like,\n\n662\n00:30:18.108 --> 00:30:20.116\nI know this isn't gonna\nbe as good as they say,\n\n663\n00:30:20.116 --> 00:30:23.019\nthen you can still make responsible\ndecisions around it, right?\n\n664\n00:30:23.019 --> 00:30:26.831\nBut we need to understand where it falls,\nand the other risk here is that some\n\n665\n00:30:26.831 --> 00:30:29.643\nproducts never make it to\nthe plateau of productivity.\n\n666\n00:30:29.643 --> 00:30:33.435\nSometimes the fall of expectations is so\n\n667\n00:30:33.435 --> 00:30:38.240\ngreat that the business closes down,\nthat's it.\n\n668\n00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:43.133\nMaybe it's really bad, there's false\nadvertising involved and now lawsuits.\n\n669\n00:30:43.133 --> 00:30:46.114\nThings can happen to stop it from\never making it to that plateau.\n\n670\n00:30:46.114 --> 00:30:49.898\nAnd if you got invested early in it, now\nthat's going to be a loss for you, right?\n\n671\n00:30:49.898 --> 00:30:52.694\n&gt;&gt; Well, where on this line is\nsupposed to be the pain of litigation?\n\n672\n00:30:52.694 --> 00:30:56.629\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The pain of litigation,\nthat probably spreads the whole thing.\n\n673\n00:30:56.629 --> 00:31:00.568\nThe other thing about this,\nsome technologies, it's not that they ever\n\n674\n00:31:00.568 --> 00:31:04.523\nmake it to the plateau of productivity,\nbut a better option comes along.\n\n675\n00:31:04.523 --> 00:31:08.123\nThey're still moving on, you see,\nthis process may take years,\n\n676\n00:31:08.123 --> 00:31:11.337\nsometimes it takes, a device,\nan application software,\n\n677\n00:31:11.337 --> 00:31:14.829\nit takes years to get all the way\nto the plateau of productivity.\n\n678\n00:31:14.829 --> 00:31:17.366\nIn the meantime,\nsome competition comes along and\n\n679\n00:31:17.366 --> 00:31:21.145\njust cleans their house, a disruptive\ntechnology, right, comes along.\n\n680\n00:31:21.145 --> 00:31:25.325\nAnd now they become obsolete,\nbefore they even made it through,\n\n681\n00:31:25.325 --> 00:31:27.608\nthat happens, that happens a lot.\n\n682\n00:31:27.608 --> 00:31:31.086\nWe're seeing that now where\nhybrid cars had their moment, but\n\n683\n00:31:31.086 --> 00:31:33.130\nnow all electric cars are coming in.\n\n684\n00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:38.000\nAnd you're like, why buy a hybrid, I'll\ngo all electric, so that happens a lot.\n\n685\n00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.760\nAnd for right inspection software,\nwhen they're going for\n\n686\n00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:43.789\nsoftware to find networking and\nfor software to find storage, and\n\n687\n00:31:43.789 --> 00:31:46.781\nthey know that all of these\ndifferent companies have a solution.\n\n688\n00:31:46.781 --> 00:31:48.365\nWhere are they at on the hype cycle,\nis it far enough along?\n\n689\n00:31:48.365 --> 00:31:51.481\nAnd we can see right here,\nkind of in the middle,\n\n690\n00:31:51.481 --> 00:31:54.449\nSoftware-Defined Anything Is coming down.\n\n691\n00:31:54.449 --> 00:31:58.797\nPeople are recognizing that yeah,\nwe thought it could do a lot.\n\n692\n00:31:58.797 --> 00:32:01.009\nIt's actually not as\namazing as we expected.\n\n693\n00:32:01.009 --> 00:32:04.110\nIt's gonna a little more disappointing\nbefore it's all said and done.\n\n694\n00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:08.812\nBut the technology is sound, it is\nwell deployed, it is well established.\n\n695\n00:32:08.812 --> 00:32:12.233\nAnd so it's gonna be around,\nit is safe to move into that world.\n\n696\n00:32:12.233 --> 00:32:16.954\nWe can see that now because we have\nbetter expectations of what's going on,\n\n697\n00:32:16.954 --> 00:32:19.928\nversus if we are way back\nhere at the beginning.\n\n698\n00:32:19.928 --> 00:32:22.836\nThings like neuromorphine hardware.\n\n699\n00:32:22.836 --> 00:32:28.144\nThings like that that are hardware\nsupporting AI and thought that\n\n700\n00:32:28.144 --> 00:32:33.855\nis really cutting edge, really new and\nwe might find it goes nowhere.\n\n701\n00:32:33.855 --> 00:32:34.647\nThat happens.\n\n702\n00:32:34.647 --> 00:32:36.447\nLook at virtual reality.\n\n703\n00:32:36.447 --> 00:32:40.407\nVirtual reality's way over here,\non the slope of enlightenment.\n\n704\n00:32:40.407 --> 00:32:45.267\nPeople are learning that virtual reality\nhas certain uses, but I remember back in\n\n705\n00:32:45.267 --> 00:32:47.395\nthe 1980s and even in the 90s\n&gt;&gt; The 90s, yeah.\n\n706\n00:32:47.395 --> 00:32:49.128\n&gt;&gt; When the movie Lawnmower Man came out.\n\n707\n00:32:49.128 --> 00:32:49.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n708\n00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:52.583\n&gt;&gt; And people thought virtual reality,\nlike we were going to live inside of this.\n\n709\n00:32:52.583 --> 00:32:55.470\nAnd now we realize no, you're going\nto watch commercials inside of this.\n\n710\n00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:56.087\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n711\n00:32:56.087 --> 00:32:58.322\n&gt;&gt; So,\nnow you kind of understand what it can do.\n\n712\n00:32:58.322 --> 00:33:00.592\nBut it is in its place.\n\n713\n00:33:00.592 --> 00:33:01.501\n3D movies.\n\n714\n00:33:01.501 --> 00:33:04.096\n3D movies went around\nlike a ten year cycle.\n\n715\n00:33:04.096 --> 00:33:06.063\nEvery ten years they would try and\nrelaunch 3D movies.\n\n716\n00:33:06.063 --> 00:33:09.678\nAnd they would then fail and disappear and\ncome back again ten years later.\n\n717\n00:33:09.678 --> 00:33:10.566\nThat kind of stuff.\n\n718\n00:33:10.566 --> 00:33:12.074\nEventually, they do take hold.\n\n719\n00:33:12.074 --> 00:33:15.549\nTheir cycle might just be longer than\nother technologies that are out there.\n\n720\n00:33:15.549 --> 00:33:18.932\n&gt;&gt; All right Don, so how does the ETG\nselect between all the options?\n\n721\n00:33:18.932 --> 00:33:22.068\n&gt;&gt; All right, so if you're right\ninspection and you've identified that you\n\n722\n00:33:22.068 --> 00:33:24.878\nwant to do the software and\nfind the network and you did your track.\n\n723\n00:33:24.878 --> 00:33:26.907\nYou identified this as\nan emerging technology,\n\n724\n00:33:26.907 --> 00:33:28.646\nyou know where it's at on the hype cycle.\n\n725\n00:33:28.646 --> 00:33:31.559\nNow we need to start\nevaluating how that can.\n\n726\n00:33:31.559 --> 00:33:32.793\nI shouldn't use the word evaluate.\n\n727\n00:33:32.793 --> 00:33:34.284\nCuz we actually have an evaluate step.\n\n728\n00:33:34.284 --> 00:33:34.889\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n729\n00:33:34.889 --> 00:33:38.900\n&gt;&gt; But we can start to take a look and\ncompare the different options that are out\n\n730\n00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:43.309\nthere and determine whether or not this\nis something we should move forward with.\n\n731\n00:33:43.309 --> 00:33:46.879\nAnd the way we do that is with\nthe next step, which is the rank step.\n\n732\n00:33:46.879 --> 00:33:50.193\nIn rank we take a look at the solution.\n\n733\n00:33:50.193 --> 00:33:53.431\nWe consider alternative candidates\nby ranking the technologies and\n\n734\n00:33:53.431 --> 00:33:55.790\nselecting those worthy\nof immediate attention.\n\n735\n00:33:55.790 --> 00:34:00.618\nWe might find ten different emerging\ntechnologies that could all benefit us\n\n736\n00:34:00.618 --> 00:34:01.755\ndifferent ways.\n\n737\n00:34:01.755 --> 00:34:03.718\nNot just software to find networking,\n\n738\n00:34:03.718 --> 00:34:07.469\nI might find other things that kind of\nalign with my business needs as well.\n\n739\n00:34:07.469 --> 00:34:10.460\nI need to look at those and\ndetermine which one's the best.\n\n740\n00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:12.995\nJust because ten things benefit me,\ndoesn't mean I should do all ten.\n\n741\n00:34:12.995 --> 00:34:15.302\nIt might be that the number one,\n\n742\n00:34:15.302 --> 00:34:19.242\nbenefits me way more than\nthe other nine all combined.\n\n743\n00:34:19.242 --> 00:34:23.134\nSo I need to determine which ones\nare really gonna benefit me the most.\n\n744\n00:34:23.134 --> 00:34:26.915\nAnd companies can do this in\na number of different ways, but\n\n745\n00:34:26.915 --> 00:34:30.939\nwhat's really a common one is\nto use a scorecard methodology.\n\n746\n00:34:30.939 --> 00:34:35.599\nWhere you take each solution and\nyou assign it a score, a value,\n\n747\n00:34:35.599 --> 00:34:39.328\na number based on your\ncompany's weighted needs.\n\n748\n00:34:39.328 --> 00:34:42.470\nSo what it is that you view as important.\n\n749\n00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:46.250\nAnd you can do it as just a text scorecard\nif you want, which is kind of boring.\n\n750\n00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:49.280\nYou'll see a lot of people\nthat will do a spider diagram.\n\n751\n00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:52.096\nNow a spider diagram looks like this,\nso here for\n\n752\n00:34:52.096 --> 00:34:55.545\nthis organization they've\ndecided that we need benefit.\n\n753\n00:34:55.545 --> 00:34:58.315\nThat's really important to us,\nthat's the one right up here at the top.\n\n754\n00:34:58.315 --> 00:35:00.019\nIt needs to benefit the company somehow,\nright?\n\n755\n00:35:00.019 --> 00:35:02.640\nIt needs to align with our scope,\nour business needs.\n\n756\n00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:07.130\nWe need champions to be able to\nactually manage this solution.\n\n757\n00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:10.686\nWe need current activity\nthat needs to support this.\n\n758\n00:35:10.686 --> 00:35:11.868\nOtherwise, it's not worth doing.\n\n759\n00:35:11.868 --> 00:35:15.242\nWe want maturity of the application.\n\n760\n00:35:15.242 --> 00:35:16.632\nWe need low cost.\n\n761\n00:35:16.632 --> 00:35:20.667\nYou may have this need you may not, every\ncompany values these things differently.\n\n762\n00:35:20.667 --> 00:35:22.352\nAnd we can assign a score.\n\n763\n00:35:22.352 --> 00:35:26.516\nNotice how each of these are divided\nup as five tics each, for 25 total.\n\n764\n00:35:26.516 --> 00:35:31.708\nSo, out of 25 points for this\nparticular candidate, what's its cost?\n\n765\n00:35:31.708 --> 00:35:34.407\nAnd so if it's low cost,\nit might have five point, or\n\n766\n00:35:34.407 --> 00:35:37.297\nmaybe scaled higher,\ndepending on how we measure this.\n\n767\n00:35:37.297 --> 00:35:39.968\nSo it might be 25 points\nif it's really low cost and\n\n768\n00:35:39.968 --> 00:35:42.590\nit if its really expensive\nit might be zero points.\n\n769\n00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:44.525\nSo we need to establish how\nwe're going to do that.\n\n770\n00:35:44.525 --> 00:35:48.467\nPart of the ranking staff is making sure\nyou have a criteria for measuring that.\n\n771\n00:35:48.467 --> 00:35:53.037\nAnd as you do this another thing that\nwe might develop at the same time is\n\n772\n00:35:53.037 --> 00:35:55.450\nwhat's called a cutoff threshold.\n\n773\n00:35:55.450 --> 00:35:59.705\nA cutoff threshold is a predetermined\nscore that we decide is\n\n774\n00:35:59.705 --> 00:36:04.387\nthe minimum acceptable value to\nmove forward with an innovation.\n\n775\n00:36:04.387 --> 00:36:08.697\nSo I might say look, I wanna make sure\nthat our company doesn't waste money\n\n776\n00:36:08.697 --> 00:36:11.310\non things that are exorbitantly expensive.\n\n777\n00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:13.444\nThat we get things at a certain value.\n\n778\n00:36:13.444 --> 00:36:17.193\nSo we're gonna set the cutoff\nthreshold at five.\n\n779\n00:36:17.193 --> 00:36:21.650\nAnd if something scores below a five,\nthis would be a ten.\n\n780\n00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:22.533\nSorry, I'm reading this wrong.\n\n781\n00:36:22.533 --> 00:36:25.080\nSo I'm gonna set the cutoff\nthreshold at a ten.\n\n782\n00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:28.706\nIf somebody scores below a ten,\nwe're not gonna move forward with it.\n\n783\n00:36:28.706 --> 00:36:32.376\nWe need to find something else out\nthere that scores a ten or higher.\n\n784\n00:36:32.376 --> 00:36:35.837\nAnd we set those minimum thresholds for\neach of our scores.\n\n785\n00:36:35.837 --> 00:36:38.399\nAnd in areas like here\nwhere you see the blue,\n\n786\n00:36:38.399 --> 00:36:41.107\nthis candidate extends\nbeyond the threshold.\n\n787\n00:36:41.107 --> 00:36:41.840\nThat's good.\n\n788\n00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:44.650\nIt's giving us more benefit\nthan the minimum we need, or\n\n789\n00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:47.710\nit's giving us more scope coverage\nthan the minimum we need.\n\n790\n00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:52.292\nIt's exactly meeting the number of\nchampions that we have or that we need.\n\n791\n00:36:52.292 --> 00:36:54.652\nSo there's some areas where exactly meets.\n\n792\n00:36:54.652 --> 00:36:58.604\nThere's other areas where we're\nbelow though like low cost.\n\n793\n00:36:58.604 --> 00:37:01.085\nLow cost does not meet\nmy threshold number.\n\n794\n00:37:01.085 --> 00:37:04.862\nSo this particular candidate\nmay not be a good one for me.\n\n795\n00:37:04.862 --> 00:37:09.340\nIn fact, I may just reject it on hand and\nsay no it doesn't meet our threshold.\n\n796\n00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:12.412\nOr if I'm comparing this to\nfive others I might say yeah,\n\n797\n00:37:12.412 --> 00:37:16.004\nthis one blows the cost threshold,\nbut it meets everything else.\n\n798\n00:37:16.004 --> 00:37:18.708\nAnd no other technology\nmet that many candidates.\n\n799\n00:37:18.708 --> 00:37:21.278\nThis one may be the best, even though\nit didn't hit one of my thresholds.\n\n800\n00:37:21.278 --> 00:37:25.850\nBut by having that, it gives us a nice\nhard number to compare against.\n\n801\n00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:30.020\nAnd makes it where we can make a smarter\ndecision that's based on numbers.\n\n802\n00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:33.937\nAnd down the road, when somebody\nquestions the decision and says,\n\n803\n00:37:33.937 --> 00:37:38.353\nwhy the heck did we do all this stuff on\nBetamax as opposed to VHS or whatever?\n\n804\n00:37:38.353 --> 00:37:41.556\nWe can come back and say, well,\nhere's the analysis we did.\n\n805\n00:37:41.556 --> 00:37:44.669\nAnd well, yeah,\nwe knew the cost was a little high side.\n\n806\n00:37:44.669 --> 00:37:45.931\nIt met all of of our needs.\n\n807\n00:37:45.931 --> 00:37:47.052\nNo other technology did that.\n\n808\n00:37:47.052 --> 00:37:50.567\nAnd then who ever is evaluating could\nsay all right that makes sense.\n\n809\n00:37:50.567 --> 00:37:52.295\nI understand why you made that decision.\n\n810\n00:37:52.295 --> 00:37:54.779\nIt wasn't a,\nwe just thought that one's better.\n\n811\n00:37:54.779 --> 00:37:55.561\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n812\n00:37:55.561 --> 00:37:57.617\n&gt;&gt; And\nnow you've got no way to justify that so\n\n813\n00:37:57.617 --> 00:38:00.146\nhaving diagrams like these\nare really beneficial.\n\n814\n00:38:00.146 --> 00:38:03.230\nAnd it makes it easy to communicate as\nopposed to a text which is a series of\n\n815\n00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:05.269\nnumbers which don't\nnecessarily make sense.\n\n816\n00:38:05.269 --> 00:38:07.207\nHere it's just a quick and\neasy comparison.\n\n817\n00:38:07.207 --> 00:38:10.641\nHere's the candidate, and\nI drop the threshold on top of it.\n\n818\n00:38:10.641 --> 00:38:14.579\nNow I have an idea of how it's performance\nwould be inside of my deployment.\n\n819\n00:38:14.579 --> 00:38:18.614\nAnd I can repeat this process with\nevery other solution I'm evaluating and\n\n820\n00:38:18.614 --> 00:38:20.675\nfind the ones that best meet my needs.\n\n821\n00:38:20.675 --> 00:38:25.640\nThat's what the rank step is all about\nis figuring out which one's gonna bring\n\n822\n00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:28.212\nme the most benefit with the least risk.\n\n823\n00:38:28.212 --> 00:38:31.056\n&gt;&gt; Well, now that we're no\nlonger being arbitrary, Don,\n\n824\n00:38:31.056 --> 00:38:33.853\nwe have a good idea of what\nsolutions to go with, right?\n\n825\n00:38:33.853 --> 00:38:38.938\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if we jump way back to our,\nhere, oops.\n\n826\n00:38:38.938 --> 00:38:43.473\nWe jump way back to our street process,\nright?\n\n827\n00:38:43.473 --> 00:38:45.707\nWe just finished scope, track and rank.\n\n828\n00:38:45.707 --> 00:38:47.855\nNow, we have our innovation candidates.\n\n829\n00:38:47.855 --> 00:38:52.370\nWe have a list of emerging technologies\nthat we may want to deploy inside of our\n\n830\n00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:55.365\ncompany, that we're ready to get in and\npush out.\n\n831\n00:38:55.365 --> 00:39:00.788\nSo from there we can start to pick and\nactually get these in place.\n\n832\n00:39:00.788 --> 00:39:02.441\nSo here's where the real work starts.\n\n833\n00:39:02.441 --> 00:39:04.514\nEverything that we've done so\nfar has been theoretical,\n\n834\n00:39:04.514 --> 00:39:05.794\njust kind of like window shopping.\n\n835\n00:39:05.794 --> 00:39:08.246\nAnd now we actually get\nto do the true work.\n\n836\n00:39:08.246 --> 00:39:10.863\nSo we can jump into our evaluate.\n\n837\n00:39:10.863 --> 00:39:15.002\nAnd in evaluate we start\nto break these down.\n\n838\n00:39:15.002 --> 00:39:17.314\nWe investigate each of\nthe top-ranked candidates.\n\n839\n00:39:17.314 --> 00:39:18.820\nWhere a lack of knowledge or\n\n840\n00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:23.022\nunderstanding still prevents them from\ndeciding whether to move forward.\n\n841\n00:39:23.022 --> 00:39:25.458\nYou might already have all\nthe information you need.\n\n842\n00:39:25.458 --> 00:39:26.454\nEverything is great.\n\n843\n00:39:26.454 --> 00:39:29.352\nThe product that was promoted to you\nwas as great as you expected it to be,\n\n844\n00:39:29.352 --> 00:39:30.647\nyou're ready to move forward.\n\n845\n00:39:30.647 --> 00:39:32.099\nOr you might still have uncertainty.\n\n846\n00:39:32.099 --> 00:39:36.260\nSo, for right software they now know,\nall right, we looked and\n\n847\n00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:40.441\nsoftware to find storage is at\nthe right place in the hype cycle.\n\n848\n00:39:40.441 --> 00:39:43.857\nWe have a reasonable expectation for\nwhat it's gonna be able to deliver.\n\n849\n00:39:43.857 --> 00:39:47.489\nWe know that it's mature, enough people\nout there are already using it, so\n\n850\n00:39:47.489 --> 00:39:49.208\nit's kind of a proven technology.\n\n851\n00:39:49.208 --> 00:39:53.169\nBut we still haven't picked whether\nwe want to go with Dell or HP, or\n\n852\n00:39:53.169 --> 00:39:57.755\nwhether we want to go cloud based, and\ndo Microsoft Azure or Amazon Native US,\n\n853\n00:39:57.755 --> 00:40:01.453\nGoogle Computer whoever,\nthey haven't made that decision.\n\n854\n00:40:01.453 --> 00:40:03.191\nSo there's still a lack of knowledge, and\n\n855\n00:40:03.191 --> 00:40:05.865\nthat lack of knowledge stops you\nfrom being able to move forward.\n\n856\n00:40:05.865 --> 00:40:09.573\nAnd so\nin this phase we answer those questions,\n\n857\n00:40:09.573 --> 00:40:13.846\nthis is where we finally make\nour real hard decisions.\n\n858\n00:40:13.846 --> 00:40:16.616\nAnd that means unfortunately\nthis is where the bulk of\n\n859\n00:40:16.616 --> 00:40:18.534\nour work actually comes in, right.\n\n860\n00:40:18.534 --> 00:40:23.187\nYou really have to hit the books on this\none, and start collecting vendor data, and\n\n861\n00:40:23.187 --> 00:40:27.399\nestablishing which one is going to be\nthe right solution for what you need.\n\n862\n00:40:27.399 --> 00:40:29.591\nSo some of the techniques\nthat you want here,\n\n863\n00:40:29.591 --> 00:40:33.003\nfirst off you need a thorough\ndescription of the technology, right.\n\n864\n00:40:33.003 --> 00:40:36.160\nNo time for marketing words,\nnone of the buzz words,\n\n865\n00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:40.594\nyou need an actual description of what\nthis technology is and what it does.\n\n866\n00:40:40.594 --> 00:40:42.466\nYou need to make sure you've got\na thorough understanding of what it does.\n\n867\n00:40:42.466 --> 00:40:47.102\nWe need a business application, we need\nto document exactly how our business can\n\n868\n00:40:47.102 --> 00:40:50.114\nuse it, and\nI'm talking down to the process level.\n\n869\n00:40:50.114 --> 00:40:54.306\nWe need to understand how our employees\nare actually gonna make use of this to\n\n870\n00:40:54.306 --> 00:40:56.022\nthen meet our business needs.\n\n871\n00:40:56.022 --> 00:40:58.687\nWhich goes hand in hand with\nthe benefit to the organization,\n\n872\n00:40:58.687 --> 00:41:00.284\nwe need to know what that benefit is.\n\n873\n00:41:00.284 --> 00:41:03.442\nWe need a potential evangelist,\nthat when we go to deploy this,\n\n874\n00:41:03.442 --> 00:41:06.841\nwe need our employees to be on board,\nto want to use this technology.\n\n875\n00:41:06.841 --> 00:41:09.641\nSo we need to be thinking\nabout that ahead of time, and\n\n876\n00:41:09.641 --> 00:41:13.940\nwho is going to be our evangelist to start\npromoting that inside of the company, so\n\n877\n00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:16.210\nwe start thinking about who that would be.\n\n878\n00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:20.956\nA vendor list, we come up with a list of\nthe vendors that can provide the solution.\n\n879\n00:41:20.956 --> 00:41:23.475\nWe might have already picked the solution,\nand\n\n880\n00:41:23.475 --> 00:41:25.807\nmore than one vendor can deploy it, right.\n\n881\n00:41:25.807 --> 00:41:29.012\nIf I want an EMC-based SAN,\nI've got to go with Dell,\n\n882\n00:41:29.012 --> 00:41:31.396\nDell owns EMC, that's my only choice.\n\n883\n00:41:31.396 --> 00:41:36.033\nBut if I just want cloud-based storage,\nI could go with Amazon, Microsoft,\n\n884\n00:41:36.033 --> 00:41:36.817\nRackspace.\n\n885\n00:41:36.817 --> 00:41:41.146\nThey all provide cloud based storage\nwith basically the same services, so\n\n886\n00:41:41.146 --> 00:41:42.323\nwhich one do I pick?\n\n887\n00:41:42.323 --> 00:41:46.443\nWell I need to make sure I know\nwhich vendors I can pick from, so\n\n888\n00:41:46.443 --> 00:41:48.520\nI can then rank and score them.\n\n889\n00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:52.564\nAnd then select based on that, or it might\ncome down to a price negotiation at that\n\n890\n00:41:52.564 --> 00:41:55.254\npoint, but\nI need to understand what my options are.\n\n891\n00:41:55.254 --> 00:41:59.540\nAnd then lastly, I need to do an\nassessment of how my competition is using\n\n892\n00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:01.103\nthe technology, right.\n\n893\n00:42:01.103 --> 00:42:04.948\nIf your competition is already using\nit you needed to determine are they\n\n894\n00:42:04.948 --> 00:42:06.871\nusing it to its fullest ability, or\n\n895\n00:42:06.871 --> 00:42:11.249\nhave they already dominated a market that\nyou're not gonna be able to dominate.\n\n896\n00:42:11.249 --> 00:42:14.178\nIn which case, you might need\nto choose a different route,\n\n897\n00:42:14.178 --> 00:42:16.887\nyou've gotta kind of evaluate\nhow they're using it.\n\n898\n00:42:16.887 --> 00:42:20.981\nYou can put all this information together,\nand then use that to make the right\n\n899\n00:42:20.981 --> 00:42:24.643\ndecision, and say all right I'm\ngonna go with Amazon web services.\n\n900\n00:42:24.643 --> 00:42:28.598\nI want to have software defined storage,\nI don't want to worry about individual\n\n901\n00:42:28.598 --> 00:42:32.684\ndisks anymore, I wanna deploy service\nquickly, so I'm gonna go with Amazon AWS.\n\n902\n00:42:32.684 --> 00:42:35.418\nSo for right inspection software,\nthey make that decision.\n\n903\n00:42:35.418 --> 00:42:36.267\nAnd they say, for\n\n904\n00:42:36.267 --> 00:42:39.895\nnow on all of our customer environments\nare gonna be deployed inside of AWS,\n\n905\n00:42:39.895 --> 00:42:43.083\nwith software-defined storage\nthat's going to meet our needs.\n\n906\n00:42:43.083 --> 00:42:46.187\nThey're able to make that selection\ncuz now they have the information.\n\n907\n00:42:46.187 --> 00:42:49.549\nAnd you might have to cycle through this\nstep a couple of times, keep refining,\n\n908\n00:42:49.549 --> 00:42:52.829\ngetting more and more information until\nyou're able to make that decision.\n\n909\n00:42:52.829 --> 00:42:55.887\nYou don't want to be frozen by indecision,\nright.\n\n910\n00:42:55.887 --> 00:42:56.441\n&gt;&gt; Seen that.\n\n911\n00:42:56.441 --> 00:42:58.388\n&gt;&gt; And sometimes, the more data you get,\n\n912\n00:42:58.388 --> 00:43:00.756\nthe harder it is to make that decision,\nright?\n\n913\n00:43:00.756 --> 00:43:04.534\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely, I've had plenty of\nmanagers that are just sitting there\n\n914\n00:43:04.534 --> 00:43:08.090\ngoing, well should we go with this,\nbut this offers a little bit more.\n\n915\n00:43:08.090 --> 00:43:12.473\nAnd they just can't pull the trigger,\nand it's like you know what we're coming\n\n916\n00:43:12.473 --> 00:43:15.825\nto the part where you just need\nto make one of these and go okay,\n\n917\n00:43:15.825 --> 00:43:17.841\nI like that one better than this one.\n\n918\n00:43:17.841 --> 00:43:21.567\nA lot of times it does come down to, this\none has a little bit more of this, but\n\n919\n00:43:21.567 --> 00:43:23.451\nthis one has a little bit more of that.\n\n920\n00:43:23.451 --> 00:43:26.709\nWhich one do you like and you just\ngotta kinda like make that happen,\n\n921\n00:43:26.709 --> 00:43:29.927\notherwise you'll, like you said,\nget frozen with indecision.\n\n922\n00:43:29.927 --> 00:43:32.560\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nNow depending on your economic risk right,\n\n923\n00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:36.093\nthe more expensive the technology is\nthe more you wanna put into this.\n\n924\n00:43:36.093 --> 00:43:39.537\nSo the way you make this decision\ncould be as simple as research, right,\n\n925\n00:43:39.537 --> 00:43:41.238\nI just do research, and I find out.\n\n926\n00:43:41.238 --> 00:43:43.952\nI might go a step further and\ndo a prototype, right.\n\n927\n00:43:43.952 --> 00:43:47.804\nLet's get an evaluation, let's do\na sample, and a test and actually deploy,\n\n928\n00:43:47.804 --> 00:43:48.909\nand see what we can do.\n\n929\n00:43:48.909 --> 00:43:52.723\nWe might do a full on pilot, I might say,\nyou know what let me take 5% of my\n\n930\n00:43:52.723 --> 00:43:55.263\ncustomer base and\ntry them out in this solution.\n\n931\n00:43:55.263 --> 00:44:00.054\nI'll leave the other 95% on the regular\nsolution, and then that way I can compare.\n\n932\n00:44:00.054 --> 00:44:02.758\nThat way we dip our toes in, and\njust kinda see how it goes, and\n\n933\n00:44:02.758 --> 00:44:03.656\nevaluate, right.\n\n934\n00:44:03.656 --> 00:44:06.360\nThat's all a part of this evaluate step,\nright.\n\n935\n00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:10.781\nWe're just trying it out, we're trying\nto find the benefits, the costs, and\n\n936\n00:44:10.781 --> 00:44:11.448\nthe risks.\n\n937\n00:44:11.448 --> 00:44:13.813\nAnd make sure we actually\nhave those hammered down and\n\n938\n00:44:13.813 --> 00:44:15.032\nunderstand what they are.\n\n939\n00:44:15.032 --> 00:44:18.605\nNot just this nebulous idea of risk,\nbut like an actual number,\n\n940\n00:44:18.605 --> 00:44:22.652\nthat hey if we deployed this and\nit fails we could lose $1.3 million.\n\n941\n00:44:22.652 --> 00:44:25.517\nOr we wouldn't lose anything,\nthere's no risk at all,\n\n942\n00:44:25.517 --> 00:44:28.096\nyou wanna make sure you\nactually know what that is.\n\n943\n00:44:28.096 --> 00:44:31.800\nAnd then once you've got all that\ninformation you can make the ultimate\n\n944\n00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:32.427\ndecision.\n\n945\n00:44:32.427 --> 00:44:35.488\nAnd there's really just three\npossible decisions here,\n\n946\n00:44:35.488 --> 00:44:38.117\nyou can choose to adopt\nthe emerging technology.\n\n947\n00:44:38.117 --> 00:44:39.719\nYou can say, yes we're gonna do it,\nwe're going to deploy it.\n\n948\n00:44:39.719 --> 00:44:42.531\nOr you can choose not to adopt it,\nyou can say nope, we're not doing that,\n\n949\n00:44:42.531 --> 00:44:43.301\nthat's a bad idea.\n\n950\n00:44:43.301 --> 00:44:47.952\nOr you can choose to shelve it, and\nsay you know what let me let this wait,\n\n951\n00:44:47.952 --> 00:44:51.406\nit's in the hype cycle,\nit's not in the right spot.\n\n952\n00:44:51.406 --> 00:44:54.815\nMaybe I want to wait a little bit,\nand I'm gonna see how it goes for\n\n953\n00:44:54.815 --> 00:44:55.871\nsome other people.\n\n954\n00:44:55.871 --> 00:44:58.591\nMaybe my competitors are deploying it, but\nI can see that they're making mistakes,\n\n955\n00:44:58.591 --> 00:44:59.777\nand it's not working well for them.\n\n956\n00:44:59.777 --> 00:45:03.338\nI might want to wait just a little bit,\nand see what mistakes they make, so\n\n957\n00:45:03.338 --> 00:45:05.071\nI can avoid those mistakes myself.\n\n958\n00:45:05.071 --> 00:45:07.297\nIt's always better to learn from\nsomebody else's mistakes, right.\n\n959\n00:45:07.297 --> 00:45:07.969\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n960\n00:45:07.969 --> 00:45:10.035\n&gt;&gt; So that's all a part of this,\nbut when it's done,\n\n961\n00:45:10.035 --> 00:45:11.537\nwe'll make one of those decisions.\n\n962\n00:45:11.537 --> 00:45:14.510\nAnd if we decide not to adopt that's\nthe end of the street process,\n\n963\n00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:15.423\nwe're done right?\n\n964\n00:45:15.423 --> 00:45:17.661\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If we decide to shelve it,\n\n965\n00:45:17.661 --> 00:45:18.641\nthen we just wait.\n\n966\n00:45:18.641 --> 00:45:23.476\nBut if we decide to adopt that technology,\nthen we're ready to move on,\n\n967\n00:45:23.476 --> 00:45:24.997\nand get things going.\n\n968\n00:45:24.997 --> 00:45:28.580\n&gt;&gt; So Don what does the ETG do after\nthey have selected a technology?\n\n969\n00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:32.416\n&gt;&gt; Here's where that evangelist comes\nin right, so the ETG has done its job.\n\n970\n00:45:32.416 --> 00:45:34.405\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Technically the ETG's job is done\n\n971\n00:45:34.405 --> 00:45:35.929\nwhen they select the technology.\n\n972\n00:45:35.929 --> 00:45:40.990\nSo we're going to deploy software defined\nstorage with Amazon Web Services,\n\n973\n00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:44.143\nokay well now somebody's\nactually got to do it.\n\n974\n00:45:44.143 --> 00:45:48.088\nAnd the ETG is made up of a lot of people\nwho are not necessarily the people who\n\n975\n00:45:48.088 --> 00:45:49.664\nwill actually do the change.\n\n976\n00:45:49.664 --> 00:45:52.171\nSo this is where you bring\nin an evangelist, and\n\n977\n00:45:52.171 --> 00:45:55.505\nif this a full on project there'll\noften be a project manager.\n\n978\n00:45:55.505 --> 00:45:58.953\nSomebody who's gonna take on this\nproject of deploying our customer\n\n979\n00:45:58.953 --> 00:46:01.154\nvirtual environment inside of Amazon AWS,\n\n980\n00:46:01.154 --> 00:46:04.611\nand actually rolling forward that\nproject to get us moved over to it.\n\n981\n00:46:04.611 --> 00:46:06.918\nBut if it's simply buying\na piece of hardware,\n\n982\n00:46:06.918 --> 00:46:10.324\nthen you're evangelist will usually\njust be the operational manager\n\n983\n00:46:10.324 --> 00:46:13.053\nwho runs the department that\nwill receive that device.\n\n984\n00:46:13.053 --> 00:46:15.230\nIt varies what that's going to look like.\n\n985\n00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:17.887\nBut that's where the evangelist comes in,\n\n986\n00:46:17.887 --> 00:46:21.346\nthat hopefully we have chosen\nduring our evaluate step.\n\n987\n00:46:21.346 --> 00:46:25.432\nBut now we're in the evangelize, and\nin evangelize we inspire, educate, and\n\n988\n00:46:25.432 --> 00:46:26.966\ninvolve other people right.\n\n989\n00:46:26.966 --> 00:46:31.068\nAll the other people in our company, to\nobtain the cooperation and support of all\n\n990\n00:46:31.068 --> 00:46:35.068\nthose who will influence the successful\nadoption of the technology,right.\n\n991\n00:46:35.068 --> 00:46:37.325\nThat last part is really important here,\n\n992\n00:46:37.325 --> 00:46:40.359\nthese people will influence\nthe successful adoption.\n\n993\n00:46:40.359 --> 00:46:44.002\nYou may have found the perfect solution,\nit improves your, or\n\n994\n00:46:44.002 --> 00:46:48.062\nit meets your business needs,\nit improves your customer happiness,\n\n995\n00:46:48.062 --> 00:46:51.050\nit lowers your cost,\nit makes you more efficient.\n\n996\n00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:55.532\nBut if you're end users are resistant to\nit for some reason, then you're gonna end\n\n997\n00:46:55.532 --> 00:46:59.581\nup in the situation where you don't\nmake use of it and you ultimately fail.\n\n998\n00:46:59.581 --> 00:47:03.360\n&gt;&gt; I actually worked for company where\nthey implemented a project management\n\n999\n00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:07.381\nsystem that they spent tons of money\ndeveloping, designing,getting it, and\n\n1000\n00:47:07.381 --> 00:47:09.612\nthey said this is what\nwe're gonna use now.\n\n1001\n00:47:09.612 --> 00:47:13.561\nAnd everybody hated it, they hated so\nmuch, and refused to use it, and so\n\n1002\n00:47:13.561 --> 00:47:16.943\nit actually went back to their\nold project management system,\n\n1003\n00:47:16.943 --> 00:47:18.631\ncuz no one would use the thing.\n\n1004\n00:47:18.631 --> 00:47:20.987\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's,\nthat can be a culture problem,\n\n1005\n00:47:20.987 --> 00:47:23.464\nthat can be having the right\npeople in the right place.\n\n1006\n00:47:23.464 --> 00:47:26.045\nBut when you have a good evangelist,\nsomebody who can go out and\n\n1007\n00:47:26.045 --> 00:47:28.696\ntalk to people and say,\nlet me explain to you why we picked this.\n\n1008\n00:47:28.696 --> 00:47:30.725\nLet me show you how this\nmakes your job easier,\n\n1009\n00:47:30.725 --> 00:47:32.766\nlet me show you how this\nmakes your job better.\n\n1010\n00:47:32.766 --> 00:47:36.108\nWhen you have somebody explaining that,\nit really makes a difference.\n\n1011\n00:47:36.108 --> 00:47:40.113\nNow we're not gonna get into it here,\nwe've already gone long enough, but\n\n1012\n00:47:40.113 --> 00:47:42.431\nthere are different types of evangelists,\n\n1013\n00:47:42.431 --> 00:47:45.134\ncuz an evangelist can reign\ndown with an iron fist.\n\n1014\n00:47:45.134 --> 00:47:46.151\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n1015\n00:47:46.151 --> 00:47:48.232\nDifferent types,\ndifferent ways of problem solving.\n\n1016\n00:47:48.232 --> 00:47:51.849\nBut ultimately the evangelist is\ntrying to make sure, That everybody\n\n1017\n00:47:51.849 --> 00:47:55.172\nhas buy in on this solution, and\neveryone runs forward with it.\n\n1018\n00:47:55.172 --> 00:47:58.027\n&gt;&gt; Well Don,\ndoes the champion then, take over?\n\n1019\n00:47:58.027 --> 00:48:01.151\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now, who the champion is,\nis a bit of a mystery, right?\n\n1020\n00:48:01.151 --> 00:48:02.346\nWe're not sure who that's going to be.\n\n1021\n00:48:02.346 --> 00:48:08.972\nBut at this point, there And the ETG\nnow can do what's called transferring.\n\n1022\n00:48:08.972 --> 00:48:10.699\nIt's our final step is transfer, and\n\n1023\n00:48:10.699 --> 00:48:13.137\nthat's where the ETG kinda\nwashes our hands of this.\n\n1024\n00:48:13.137 --> 00:48:14.740\nAnd they say okay, we're done,\n\n1025\n00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:18.535\nwe've gotta move on cuz there's other\ntechnologies we've gotta evaluate.\n\n1026\n00:48:18.535 --> 00:48:22.345\nSo with transfer, we transfer\nresponsibility for a new technology to\n\n1027\n00:48:22.345 --> 00:48:27.140\nanother department or project that will\ntake it to full-scale deployment, alright?\n\n1028\n00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:29.487\nThey take it and run with it.\n\n1029\n00:48:29.487 --> 00:48:33.309\nIf it's software to find storage, somebody\ndown on the development team will be\n\n1030\n00:48:33.309 --> 00:48:35.291\nthe person that helms that, runs for it.\n\n1031\n00:48:35.291 --> 00:48:36.631\nAnd actually gets\nthe stuff moving forward.\n\n1032\n00:48:36.631 --> 00:48:38.409\nThe project [INAUDIBLE]\nnot the project manager.\n\n1033\n00:48:38.409 --> 00:48:41.250\nBut the ETG transfers over to them.\n\n1034\n00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:45.170\nAnd then, says, okay, now, we're going\nto go way back to the beginning,\n\n1035\n00:48:45.170 --> 00:48:47.454\nwhen we were doing scope and track, right?\n\n1036\n00:48:47.454 --> 00:48:48.767\nSo we just deployed this new technology.\n\n1037\n00:48:48.767 --> 00:48:50.895\nDoes our scope change, it might.\n\n1038\n00:48:50.895 --> 00:48:53.674\nRight we might have new business\nneeds now as a result of having this\n\n1039\n00:48:53.674 --> 00:48:54.628\ntechnology in place.\n\n1040\n00:48:54.628 --> 00:48:58.034\nAnd then, our track, we're looking for\nnew solutions, all right?\n\n1041\n00:48:58.034 --> 00:49:01.142\nMaybe there's something that can make this\none better because this process might have\n\n1042\n00:49:01.142 --> 00:49:01.663\ntaken years.\n\n1043\n00:49:01.663 --> 00:49:03.635\nAnd now when we start our next one,\n\n1044\n00:49:03.635 --> 00:49:06.292\nwe might all ready have\nthe next thing in line.\n\n1045\n00:49:06.292 --> 00:49:07.622\nWe just finished deploying this, but\n\n1046\n00:49:07.622 --> 00:49:09.380\nthe next thing in line is\nall ready on the horizon.\n\n1047\n00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:11.091\nSo, we start looking at it and\nmoving forward.\n\n1048\n00:49:11.091 --> 00:49:13.659\nBut we need to free up\nthe ETG to do what they do.\n\n1049\n00:49:13.659 --> 00:49:15.521\nAnd it may be that one or two or\n\n1050\n00:49:15.521 --> 00:49:20.428\nmaybe even all the members of the ETG\ngo on to do the actual implementation.\n\n1051\n00:49:20.428 --> 00:49:23.410\nAnd we build a whole new ETG,\nwith all new employees.\n\n1052\n00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:26.233\nIt's not ideal, cause a lot of\nretraining and re-education, but\n\n1053\n00:49:26.233 --> 00:49:27.678\nthen that is certainly possible.\n\n1054\n00:49:27.678 --> 00:49:30.485\nAnd now they roll forward without\nactually moving forward, but\n\n1055\n00:49:30.485 --> 00:49:32.781\nthat's really what the transfer\nstep is all about.\n\n1056\n00:49:32.781 --> 00:49:36.772\nBut when that's all said and done,\nwe've completed the street process.\n\n1057\n00:49:36.772 --> 00:49:40.303\nWe've moved through all six steps,\nwe made smart decisions,\n\n1058\n00:49:40.303 --> 00:49:43.978\nwe evaluated the technologies,\nwe chose them, we deploy them.\n\n1059\n00:49:43.978 --> 00:49:45.590\nHopefully, deployed them successfully.\n\n1060\n00:49:45.590 --> 00:49:48.012\nAnd now we're just evaluating\nwhat's next on the horizon.\n\n1061\n00:49:48.012 --> 00:49:52.768\nAnd by doing this we've hopefully\navoided selecting technologies\n\n1062\n00:49:52.768 --> 00:49:55.026\nthat were unneccessary risks.\n\n1063\n00:49:55.026 --> 00:49:57.849\nThat were not where they needed to be for\nus to accept them and\n\n1064\n00:49:57.849 --> 00:49:59.046\nmove forward with them.\n\n1065\n00:49:59.046 --> 00:50:01.598\n&gt;&gt; All right well Don it was a great\nlook at the Gartner Street Process.\n\n1066\n00:50:01.598 --> 00:50:04.960\nWe do appreciate you walking us through\nthat, holding our little hands.\n\n1067\n00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:07.497\nSo that we'll understand\nit a little bit better and\n\n1068\n00:50:07.497 --> 00:50:09.392\nmaybe be better at our process there.\n\n1069\n00:50:09.392 --> 00:50:12.531\nAnd that being said, I'm looking at our\nclock though, we are out of time for\n\n1070\n00:50:12.531 --> 00:50:13.183\nthis episode.\n\n1071\n00:50:13.183 --> 00:50:16.720\nWe do thank our audience out there for\nwatching but signing off for\n\n1072\n00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:19.844\nITPROTV I've been your host Daniel Lowry\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don

00:00:08.177\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.177 --> 00:00:11.520\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT ProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.544\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:13.544 --> 00:00:16.657\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.657 --> 00:00:20.285\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode we are back to taking\n\n8\n00:00:20.285 --> 00:00:22.486\nanother look at our\nGartner STREET process.\n\n9\n00:00:22.486 --> 00:00:25.760\nAnd joining us back in the studio yet\nagain is our good friend, Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n10\n00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.179\nDon, welcome back to the show,\nhow's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:28.990\n&gt;&gt; It is going great Daniel,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n12\n00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.578\nAnd that the last episode,\n\n13\n00:00:30.578 --> 00:00:34.252\nwe got a chance to really do a deep\ndive into the STREET process.\n\n14\n00:00:34.252 --> 00:00:38.579\nWhat each step along that framework was,\nand what a company is expected to do.\n\n15\n00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.125\nIn this episode we wanna\nbe a little bit different.\n\n16\n00:00:41.125 --> 00:00:43.187\nWe're gonna go a little more brief and\n\n17\n00:00:43.187 --> 00:00:47.442\nI wanna give you guys kind of a real world\nexample, an example of how a company or\n\n18\n00:00:47.442 --> 00:00:50.748\norganization would move through\nthis to support a product.\n\n19\n00:00:50.748 --> 00:00:54.014\nIn the last one we did\nthe Write Software incorporated,\n\n20\n00:00:54.014 --> 00:00:57.012\nthey created that software for\nhome inspections.\n\n21\n00:00:57.012 --> 00:00:58.647\nIn this one,\nwe're gonna use a different company.\n\n22\n00:00:58.647 --> 00:01:01.992\nWe're gonna use\nDapper Clothing Incorporated,\n\n23\n00:01:01.992 --> 00:01:07.180\na clothing retailer that has mall stores\nall over the world or US or wherever.\n\n24\n00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.324\nAnd they're going through this process\nof evaluating emerging technologies and\n\n25\n00:01:11.324 --> 00:01:13.967\nfiguring out how they're\ngoing to be implemented or\n\n26\n00:01:13.967 --> 00:01:16.199\nif they're going to be implemented at all.\n\n27\n00:01:16.199 --> 00:01:19.257\nBut the key thing here is I wanted to\ngive you a real example and kind of move\n\n28\n00:01:19.257 --> 00:01:22.717\nthe teaching piece off and just go right\ninto here's how it works, so that you guys\n\n29\n00:01:22.717 --> 00:01:26.105\nhave a good understanding of what it's\nkind of like out there in the real world.\n\n30\n00:01:26.105 --> 00:01:28.890\nSo that's what we've got lined\nup right here in this episode.\n\n31\n00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.912\n&gt;&gt; All right Don,\nyou set a bit of a stage for us.\n\n32\n00:01:30.912 --> 00:01:34.712\nBut what is the actual idea?\n\n33\n00:01:34.712 --> 00:01:36.073\nWhat is the scenario here?\n\n34\n00:01:36.073 --> 00:01:39.770\n&gt;&gt; All right, well we have to kind of\nhave of process that gets initiated.\n\n35\n00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.977\nSo somebody in the company somewhere,\nyou have this company that exists.\n\n36\n00:01:42.977 --> 00:01:43.670\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n37\n00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.165\nAnd someone in that company gets an idea,\nan idea that, hey,\n\n38\n00:01:47.165 --> 00:01:51.617\nthere's something we should be doing\nto make our experience better, right?\n\n39\n00:01:51.617 --> 00:01:53.831\nAnd that idea could come\nfrom any number of places.\n\n40\n00:01:53.831 --> 00:01:55.232\nIt could come just\nstraight from their head.\n\n41\n00:01:55.232 --> 00:01:57.431\nMaybe they just thought of something\nthat pops into their mind.\n\n42\n00:01:57.431 --> 00:01:58.940\nLike maybe we should\nreally look into that.\n\n43\n00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.980\nOr maybe it's a documented\nneed of the company.\n\n44\n00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.188\nOr more commonly, they're out there\non the Internet or whatever and\n\n45\n00:02:05.188 --> 00:02:06.966\nthey come across an article, right?\n\n46\n00:02:06.966 --> 00:02:11.105\nI've got an example here on my screen\nthat maybe they're out there browsing and\n\n47\n00:02:11.105 --> 00:02:13.205\nthey've seen an article like this one,\n\n48\n00:02:13.205 --> 00:02:16.510\nThe Internet of Things Revolutionizing\nthe Retail Industry.\n\n49\n00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.462\nNow, even if you don't know\nwhat this article is about,\n\n50\n00:02:19.462 --> 00:02:22.798\nif you work in the retail industry\nwhat does this make you think?\n\n51\n00:02:22.798 --> 00:02:23.936\n&gt;&gt; Maybe I need to do this.\n\n52\n00:02:23.936 --> 00:02:27.102\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're gonna get\nrevolutionized out of the business.\n\n53\n00:02:27.102 --> 00:02:30.189\nSomebody else is getting this competitive\nadvantage and we're gonna miss out.\n\n54\n00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:32.877\nAnd so, this peaks interest.\n\n55\n00:02:32.877 --> 00:02:35.555\nIt gets people thinking\nthat they have something\n\n56\n00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:37.524\nout there that they need to deploy.\n\n57\n00:02:37.524 --> 00:02:40.928\nTheir customer experience,\nsupply chain, new channels and revenue,\n\n58\n00:02:40.928 --> 00:02:43.730\nall these different things\nare out there waiting for them.\n\n59\n00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:44.595\n&gt;&gt; Shoot, I'm exited.\n\n60\n00:02:44.595 --> 00:02:46.564\n&gt;&gt; I almost feel like the price is right,\nyou know?\n\n61\n00:02:46.564 --> 00:02:47.908\nAll this could be yours.\n\n62\n00:02:47.908 --> 00:02:48.708\n&gt;&gt; $1.\n\n63\n00:02:48.708 --> 00:02:52.951\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So this is where an idea\nstarts, and people start to talk in\n\n64\n00:02:52.951 --> 00:02:57.998\nthe company, and that's when we start\nshifting into that STREET process.\n\n65\n00:02:57.998 --> 00:03:02.815\nSo, in the real world, these ideas\ncan come from the craziest places,\n\n66\n00:03:02.815 --> 00:03:05.402\nnot necessarily a website like this.\n\n67\n00:03:05.402 --> 00:03:07.764\nIt might be just chatter they\noverheard on the street.\n\n68\n00:03:07.764 --> 00:03:09.339\nThey might be watching\nthe news in the morning.\n\n69\n00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:10.499\nThey talk to a friend.\n\n70\n00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:12.108\nThey see what competitors are doing.\n\n71\n00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:15.543\nThis idea originates from somewhere.\n\n72\n00:03:15.543 --> 00:03:18.584\nBut occasionally, there is no idea.\n\n73\n00:03:18.584 --> 00:03:23.003\nIt's more of a brainstorming session where\nthe company sits down and says, all right,\n\n74\n00:03:23.003 --> 00:03:26.899\nI want everybody to think what is an area\nthat we might be able to improve upon?\n\n75\n00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:31.194\nBut that's a lot less frequent because\nit's not that common that people have\n\n76\n00:03:31.194 --> 00:03:32.922\ngenuinely, original ideas.\n\n77\n00:03:32.922 --> 00:03:35.143\nThey're just sitting in a room and\nthey go, you know what?\n\n78\n00:03:35.143 --> 00:03:38.159\nI bet if we did this things would be so\nmuch better.\n\n79\n00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:39.037\nIt does happen,\n\n80\n00:03:39.037 --> 00:03:42.820\nyou have those brilliant minds that\nsometimes just pop out of nowhere.\n\n81\n00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.621\nBut it's far less common.\n\n82\n00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:46.875\nUsually it's inspired by\nsome kind of outside source.\n\n83\n00:03:46.875 --> 00:03:49.940\nThat's really what kicks\noff this process and\n\n84\n00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.407\ngets us moving into STREET\nis that idea that pops up.\n\n85\n00:03:53.407 --> 00:03:59.046\nSo if we take Dapper, for example and\nstart to kind of negotiate the process\n\n86\n00:03:59.046 --> 00:04:04.328\nwith them, what's gonna happen is\nthey're going to have this idea,\n\n87\n00:04:04.328 --> 00:04:09.808\nsomebody thinks about it, and\nwe start to move into the STREET process.\n\n88\n00:04:09.808 --> 00:04:13.988\nWe actually go into that,\nwe take that idea, and we run with it.\n\n89\n00:04:13.988 --> 00:04:19.230\nNow, if we don't even have an idea yet,\nwe start in the scope step.\n\n90\n00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.273\nBut even if an idea has\nbeen presented to us,\n\n91\n00:04:21.273 --> 00:04:24.937\nwe're gonna start in that scope step\nanyway, that's kind of where we start.\n\n92\n00:04:24.937 --> 00:04:27.007\nSome people will choose to jump\nover to track or whatever.\n\n93\n00:04:27.007 --> 00:04:29.958\nThey'll say like we wanna\nfind an area to improve, but\n\n94\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.891\nwe don't know what we can improve.\n\n95\n00:04:31.891 --> 00:04:35.636\nSo let's just go to track and we'll start\nwatching all of the stuff that's out\n\n96\n00:04:35.636 --> 00:04:38.660\nthere and try and find something\nnew that we could start to use.\n\n97\n00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.580\nBut if the idea has already\nbeen brought to us,\n\n98\n00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.563\nit makes more sense to\nstart in that scope step.\n\n99\n00:04:42.563 --> 00:04:45.528\nThat's where we're going to initiate and\nstart to move forward.\n\n100\n00:04:45.528 --> 00:04:47.445\nSo, for the Dapper Clothing,\n\n101\n00:04:47.445 --> 00:04:51.734\nwe don't necessarily know where\nwe're gonna come from on this one.\n\n102\n00:04:51.734 --> 00:04:55.548\nSo let's just say in our scenario here,\nthat one of your executives happen to come\n\n103\n00:04:55.548 --> 00:04:57.943\nacross that article I just\nshowed you a moment ago.\n\n104\n00:04:57.943 --> 00:05:02.279\nAnd they want to look at using\nthat inside of our organization.\n\n105\n00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:06.740\nNow, we need to know a little bit about\nDapper before we go too crazy on this,\n\n106\n00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:07.241\nright.\n\n107\n00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:08.609\nAnd so looking at the company itself,\n\n108\n00:05:08.609 --> 00:05:10.335\nwe just need to know some basic things,\nright.\n\n109\n00:05:10.335 --> 00:05:13.983\nThey're a large retail organization,\nso they've got money,\n\n110\n00:05:13.983 --> 00:05:17.910\nthey've got infrastructure,\nthey've got resources available.\n\n111\n00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.021\nThey sell clothing and\naccessories through a mall-based store.\n\n112\n00:05:21.021 --> 00:05:23.606\nSo they've got shopping malls-\n&gt;&gt; Brick and mortars.\n\n113\n00:05:23.606 --> 00:05:25.589\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, brick and mortar,\nthey have physical presence.\n\n114\n00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:28.298\nThat's important,\nbecause web-based companies are a lot\n\n115\n00:05:28.298 --> 00:05:30.964\ndifferent than brick and\nmortar, or physical companies.\n\n116\n00:05:30.964 --> 00:05:33.040\nThere are a lot of extra\nresources involved there.\n\n117\n00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.952\nAnd then more importantly,\nthey're a type A organization.\n\n118\n00:05:37.952 --> 00:05:42.407\nType A means they are aggressive\nabout taking risk.\n\n119\n00:05:42.407 --> 00:05:45.958\nThey are looking for strategies that\nthey can implement that might fail,\n\n120\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.660\nthey might lose some money but\nthey're okay with that.\n\n121\n00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.723\nBecause for each failure,\nthere's the opportunity for success.\n\n122\n00:05:52.723 --> 00:05:55.713\nAnd the greater the risk,\nthe greater the reward.\n\n123\n00:05:55.713 --> 00:05:59.476\nAnd they know that on those\noccasions when they get the reward,\n\n124\n00:05:59.476 --> 00:06:04.305\nit serves as a competitive advantage over,\nwell, their competitors, right?\n\n125\n00:06:04.305 --> 00:06:05.224\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n126\n00:06:05.224 --> 00:06:05.776\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's where the word\n\n127\n00:06:05.776 --> 00:06:07.578\ncomes from.\nOver all the other vendors\n\n128\n00:06:07.578 --> 00:06:12.227\nthat are in that retail space, right,\nit makes them dominant in their field.\n\n129\n00:06:12.227 --> 00:06:15.219\nAnd if they don't take those risks,\nthey don't get that reward and\n\n130\n00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:16.699\npotentially someone else will.\n\n131\n00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:19.168\nSo they're aggressively seeking that out.\n\n132\n00:06:19.168 --> 00:06:22.727\nAnd so if one of the executives brings\nforth this article, it's saying hey,\n\n133\n00:06:22.727 --> 00:06:24.220\nthis Internet of Things stuff.\n\n134\n00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.245\nI might not know what it is, but\napparently it's revolutionary.\n\n135\n00:06:27.245 --> 00:06:30.071\nWe need to look into implementing that and\nsee what it can do for us right?\n\n136\n00:06:30.071 --> 00:06:33.002\nSo that's the company\nthat we're working with.\n\n137\n00:06:33.002 --> 00:06:36.746\nAnd now we just need to see how we go\nthrough that process to determine whether\n\n138\n00:06:36.746 --> 00:06:40.432\nor not what we just learned from that\narticle is even something we should act\n\n139\n00:06:40.432 --> 00:06:44.178\non at all or whether it's something we\nshould definitely move forward on and\n\n140\n00:06:44.178 --> 00:06:45.848\nput us ahead of our competition.\n\n141\n00:06:45.848 --> 00:06:48.947\n&gt;&gt; All right Don, so you mentioned that we\nstart right here at the scope step, right.\n\n142\n00:06:48.947 --> 00:06:52.082\nThat's our number one place to begin,\nbut can you give us a little\n\n143\n00:06:52.082 --> 00:06:54.881\nreminder of exactly what is\ninvolved inside that script.\n\n144\n00:06:54.881 --> 00:06:57.940\n&gt;&gt; All right, so the scope step itself.\n\n145\n00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.012\nThis is where we identify\nour business needs.\n\n146\n00:07:00.012 --> 00:07:02.406\nBecause anything that we implement\nshould kind of line up with the business\n\n147\n00:07:02.406 --> 00:07:02.938\nneeds, right?\n\n148\n00:07:02.938 --> 00:07:08.331\nAnd that official definition was that\nwe get that business focus and context.\n\n149\n00:07:08.331 --> 00:07:12.152\nThat's what we're looking for, to make\nsure that whatever we're doing actually\n\n150\n00:07:12.152 --> 00:07:14.676\nlines up with our business,\nwhat we're trying to do.\n\n151\n00:07:14.676 --> 00:07:19.135\nSo we need to think about our company and\nwhat its goals are.\n\n152\n00:07:19.135 --> 00:07:23.062\nMost companies do have a mission,\nvision, value, typed statement.\n\n153\n00:07:23.062 --> 00:07:24.870\nAnd Dapper is no exception to that.\n\n154\n00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.398\nSo Dapper has a very simple set of goals.\n\n155\n00:07:27.398 --> 00:07:31.021\nOne, they want to provide the best\ncustomer experience possible.\n\n156\n00:07:31.021 --> 00:07:33.143\nCustomers shouldn't hate\ncoming to their store,\n\n157\n00:07:33.143 --> 00:07:34.832\nthey should look forward to it, right.\n\n158\n00:07:34.832 --> 00:07:36.443\nWe want to create a great\ncustomer experience.\n\n159\n00:07:36.443 --> 00:07:40.048\nTwo, they always want to be\na leader in shopping technologies.\n\n160\n00:07:40.048 --> 00:07:43.312\nSo if you think about it, the first\ntime you went to a grocery store and\n\n161\n00:07:43.312 --> 00:07:44.787\nthey had a self checkout line.\n\n162\n00:07:44.787 --> 00:07:46.980\nThat was pretty neat,\nit was a lot faster, right?\n\n163\n00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.164\nThey want to be like that.\n\n164\n00:07:48.164 --> 00:07:51.828\nBut when there's some new advancement\nin the clothing retail industry,\n\n165\n00:07:51.828 --> 00:07:52.842\nthey wanna have it.\n\n166\n00:07:52.842 --> 00:07:55.106\nThey want to be that market leader.\n\n167\n00:07:55.106 --> 00:07:56.874\nThey want to attract the best talent.\n\n168\n00:07:56.874 --> 00:07:58.970\nNow, let's talk about employees, right?\n\n169\n00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.372\nHow do we get the best\nemployees to come work for us?\n\n170\n00:08:01.372 --> 00:08:03.738\nWell, some of these goals work together.\n\n171\n00:08:03.738 --> 00:08:06.831\nIf we have the greatest technology, a lot\nof employees will want to come and work\n\n172\n00:08:06.831 --> 00:08:09.848\nfor us anyway because we give them the\nopportunity to be the best at their job.\n\n173\n00:08:09.848 --> 00:08:11.278\nAnd have the most resources.\n\n174\n00:08:11.278 --> 00:08:14.613\nBut other times if just create a very\nstable, very structured environment that\n\n175\n00:08:14.613 --> 00:08:17.672\nrespects the employees, that will\nlead to people wanting to come to us.\n\n176\n00:08:17.672 --> 00:08:19.503\nSo we need to think about that too.\n\n177\n00:08:19.503 --> 00:08:23.995\nAnd then lastly, we want to improve\nefficiencies in all procedures.\n\n178\n00:08:23.995 --> 00:08:27.479\nAnd that's part of continual\nprocess improvement, or CPI,\n\n179\n00:08:27.479 --> 00:08:29.697\nthat every process can be done better.\n\n180\n00:08:29.697 --> 00:08:31.718\nEven if it's being done great right now,\n\n181\n00:08:31.718 --> 00:08:35.816\nthere's probably some way to make it more\nefficient, and either make it go faster,\n\n182\n00:08:35.816 --> 00:08:39.477\nor make it cheaper, and make it where\nwe can better support our customers.\n\n183\n00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:41.408\nSo these are the four goals.\n\n184\n00:08:41.408 --> 00:08:45.787\nAnd when we're in the scope step\nwe're identifying these solutions and\n\n185\n00:08:45.787 --> 00:08:50.329\ntrying to figure out whether or not\nthey align with these goals right here.\n\n186\n00:08:50.329 --> 00:08:53.717\nSo, these goals need to be known and\nyou probably already know them for\n\n187\n00:08:53.717 --> 00:08:57.623\nyour company, but if this is the very\nfirst time you're going through the street\n\n188\n00:08:57.623 --> 00:09:01.317\nprocess, then scope is really focused\non defining these goals right here.\n\n189\n00:09:01.317 --> 00:09:03.219\nWe need to understand what they are.\n\n190\n00:09:03.219 --> 00:09:04.879\nDapper already has theirs,\nso that's great.\n\n191\n00:09:04.879 --> 00:09:07.130\nNow we can kinda compare against it.\n\n192\n00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:10.788\nAnd we can start to look at other\nsolutions that are out there.\n\n193\n00:09:10.788 --> 00:09:13.881\nWith the internet of things,\nwhat can it do for us?\n\n194\n00:09:13.881 --> 00:09:18.162\nRight, well what can IoT do for\nus that lines up with these goals, right?\n\n195\n00:09:18.162 --> 00:09:21.252\nSo as part of that scope stage,\nwe start to identify this.\n\n196\n00:09:21.252 --> 00:09:23.829\nWe have a brainstorming meeting,\na visioning meeting,\n\n197\n00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:27.264\nwe get a group of people together, and\nnow I'm not telling them hey I want you\n\n198\n00:09:27.264 --> 00:09:30.781\nto just think of something out of the blue\nthat might make our company better.\n\n199\n00:09:30.781 --> 00:09:34.714\nWe're saying hey I want everyone\nto read this IoT article.\n\n200\n00:09:34.714 --> 00:09:37.279\nSo we distribute the article,\neverybody reads it.\n\n201\n00:09:37.279 --> 00:09:38.307\nAnd then we say,\n\n202\n00:09:38.307 --> 00:09:43.613\nthink about your business unit because you\nmight have accountants that are in there.\n\n203\n00:09:43.613 --> 00:09:46.641\nYou might have people that\nare working the loading bays,\n\n204\n00:09:46.641 --> 00:09:49.998\nyou might have the managers,\nthe people who do the logistics.\n\n205\n00:09:49.998 --> 00:09:54.330\nYou might have actual retail sales\nemployees that are part of it,\n\n206\n00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.629\nyour sales manager, marketing.\n\n207\n00:09:56.629 --> 00:10:00.194\nYou get each of these people together,\nthe managers or the heads, and\n\n208\n00:10:00.194 --> 00:10:02.809\nyou say think about it in\nterms of your department.\n\n209\n00:10:02.809 --> 00:10:03.729\nHow could you benefit?\n\n210\n00:10:03.729 --> 00:10:08.668\nWhen you read this article, what do you\nsee in there that could benefit you, and\n\n211\n00:10:08.668 --> 00:10:13.020\nit might be something very,\nvery simple that we can increase our sales\n\n212\n00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.736\nby having some kind of better\ninventory management right?\n\n213\n00:10:16.736 --> 00:10:18.032\nAnd we start to identify that.\n\n214\n00:10:18.032 --> 00:10:20.961\nSo with this IoT we start to look at it.\n\n215\n00:10:20.961 --> 00:10:23.809\nAnd the brainstorming meeting people\nthrow out those suggestions right?\n\n216\n00:10:23.809 --> 00:10:26.770\nThe executives are driving this,\none of the executives read the article and\n\n217\n00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:28.541\nis now saying we need to\nmove forward with it.\n\n218\n00:10:28.541 --> 00:10:31.569\nBut each of the individual people\nthat are your operational manager,\n\n219\n00:10:31.569 --> 00:10:34.355\nthey will come up with better ideas\nof how it can be implemented.\n\n220\n00:10:34.355 --> 00:10:36.517\nAnd so we're thinking of things like,\n\n221\n00:10:36.517 --> 00:10:39.999\ncan we improve the customer\nexperience with innovate things.\n\n222\n00:10:39.999 --> 00:10:42.329\nWhen a customer comes in\nto buy something now,\n\n223\n00:10:42.329 --> 00:10:45.195\nmaybe they don't know where to\nfind a shirt on the rack and\n\n224\n00:10:45.195 --> 00:10:49.316\nthey grab the shirt, they try it on, then\nthey take it up to the cashier register,\n\n225\n00:10:49.316 --> 00:10:52.279\nthey wait in line,\nthen they check out, then they leave.\n\n226\n00:10:52.279 --> 00:10:57.033\nBut with Internet of Things, we can\ndo something really interesting like\n\n227\n00:10:57.033 --> 00:11:02.092\nthere can be an RFID tag on the shirt and\nso they go and they take it off the shelf,\n\n228\n00:11:02.092 --> 00:11:05.408\ntry it on, if they like it,\nthey walk out the door.\n\n229\n00:11:05.408 --> 00:11:07.396\nAnd bypass the cash register all together.\n\n230\n00:11:07.396 --> 00:11:11.158\nAnd as they walk through the door,\nit can detect the RFID tag and\n\n231\n00:11:11.158 --> 00:11:12.579\ncharge their account.\n\n232\n00:11:12.579 --> 00:11:15.710\nAnd now they just paid right when\nthey walked out the door, right?\n\n233\n00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:18.470\nNow, that sounds like\na revolutionary thing but\n\n234\n00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.244\nthis is actually already\nout there in the field.\n\n235\n00:11:21.244 --> 00:11:22.890\nSeveral Apple stores have it and\n\n236\n00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:25.638\na couple of other retail\norganizations have done it.\n\n237\n00:11:25.638 --> 00:11:29.407\nWhere you've got that and\ndoes that improve the customer experience.\n\n238\n00:11:29.407 --> 00:11:30.310\n&gt;&gt; I would say yes.\n\n239\n00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:32.962\n&gt;&gt; You are not waiting in a line\nat a register anymore right.\n\n240\n00:11:32.962 --> 00:11:34.902\nSo that's something that IoT can do.\n\n241\n00:11:34.902 --> 00:11:37.395\n&gt;&gt; That would be amazing during\nthe holiday times right.\n\n242\n00:11:37.395 --> 00:11:38.982\n&gt;&gt; Yeah when the lines get really busy.\n\n243\n00:11:38.982 --> 00:11:40.707\nNow you are just walking out the door and\n\n244\n00:11:40.707 --> 00:11:43.018\nit's handling all that\nprocess in the background.\n\n245\n00:11:43.018 --> 00:11:44.874\nCan we create a unique\nshopping experience?\n\n246\n00:11:44.874 --> 00:11:48.215\nWell, that might have been unique,\nif you did it a year ago.\n\n247\n00:11:48.215 --> 00:11:51.399\nBut other people have it now, so\nit's no longer a competitive advantage, so\n\n248\n00:11:51.399 --> 00:11:52.778\nwe've got to find more, right?\n\n249\n00:11:52.778 --> 00:11:55.293\nWell, what if we had something\nlike a smart mirror?\n\n250\n00:11:55.293 --> 00:11:57.591\nI don't know if you've seen these,\nDaniel, but\n\n251\n00:11:57.591 --> 00:11:59.738\nKinda project the clothing\nonto your person?\n\n252\n00:11:59.738 --> 00:12:01.745\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nyou stand in front of this mirror.\n\n253\n00:12:01.745 --> 00:12:03.994\nYou don't even have to try the shirt on,\nit just makes it appear.\n\n254\n00:12:03.994 --> 00:12:07.605\nAnd now you're not having to go to\na fitting room and take off your shirt and\n\n255\n00:12:07.605 --> 00:12:10.983\nput on another shirt that who knows\nhow many people have tried on, and\n\n256\n00:12:10.983 --> 00:12:11.989\nthat kind of stuff.\n\n257\n00:12:11.989 --> 00:12:14.500\nYou don't have to worry about, did I\nget all the needles out of that shirt?\n\n258\n00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.229\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz there's always an extra pin in\n\n259\n00:12:16.229 --> 00:12:16.907\nthere somewhere.\n\n260\n00:12:16.907 --> 00:12:18.772\n&gt;&gt; Man, and\nyou find that one real quick, don't you?\n\n261\n00:12:18.772 --> 00:12:20.981\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Every time.\n\n262\n00:12:20.981 --> 00:12:22.954\nSo does that create a unique experience?\n\n263\n00:12:22.954 --> 00:12:24.748\nAbsolutely, right?\n\n264\n00:12:24.748 --> 00:12:27.977\nIf it's feasible, if it's possible, if we\ncan get it in there people will love that.\n\n265\n00:12:27.977 --> 00:12:30.737\nAnd are there other\noperational efficiencies?\n\n266\n00:12:30.737 --> 00:12:35.097\nWhat can IoT do to improve\nour operational efficiencies?\n\n267\n00:12:35.097 --> 00:12:37.950\nWell, maybe it's inventory management.\n\n268\n00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:42.698\nHey, when a customer takes\nthat shirt off the shelf.\n\n269\n00:12:42.698 --> 00:12:45.646\nAnd they try it on and\nthey walk out the door.\n\n270\n00:12:45.646 --> 00:12:50.313\nIt could deduct one from inventory\nimmediately and then order more if needed.\n\n271\n00:12:50.313 --> 00:12:52.004\nIt could report that to the website so\n\n272\n00:12:52.004 --> 00:12:54.306\nmaybe the customer already\nknows what they want.\n\n273\n00:12:54.306 --> 00:12:56.795\nThey could come to the website and\nsee whether we had it in inventory, right?\n\n274\n00:12:56.795 --> 00:12:59.009\nIf it was tagged and\ninventoried like that.\n\n275\n00:12:59.009 --> 00:12:59.873\nWe'd be able to see it.\n\n276\n00:12:59.873 --> 00:13:02.443\nThat would make things more efficient,\nright?\n\n277\n00:13:02.443 --> 00:13:05.864\nWe could even say, how many times\nwas that shirt taken off the shelf?\n\n278\n00:13:05.864 --> 00:13:07.553\nMaybe they didn't buy it but\nat least they tried it on.\n\n279\n00:13:07.553 --> 00:13:12.253\nThat would show interest in the shirt\nthat you wouldn't necessarily see with\n\n280\n00:13:12.253 --> 00:13:13.129\nsales alone.\n\n281\n00:13:13.129 --> 00:13:15.835\nSo you could start to kind of measure and\nsee things there.\n\n282\n00:13:15.835 --> 00:13:20.110\nReally interesting stuff you could do\nthat improve operational efficiency.\n\n283\n00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:25.935\nSo all of that makes me think that IOT\nmight be a good fit for Dapper Clothing.\n\n284\n00:13:25.935 --> 00:13:28.721\nBut if I ran through this list and\nI couldn't think of anything,\n\n285\n00:13:28.721 --> 00:13:31.453\nlike I can't really find a way\nthat this lines up with my goals,\n\n286\n00:13:31.453 --> 00:13:35.065\nthen that's a great indicator right there\nin the early stage, in the scope stage,\n\n287\n00:13:35.065 --> 00:13:36.646\nthat we don't wanna move forward.\n\n288\n00:13:36.646 --> 00:13:40.267\nBut in this case, I think we've really got\na good one things line up pretty well,\n\n289\n00:13:40.267 --> 00:13:42.726\nthis looks a project that we\nshould move forward with.\n\n290\n00:13:42.726 --> 00:13:43.280\n&gt;&gt; So, Don,\n\n291\n00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:47.177\nonce we've established that need,\nthen how do we come up with a solution.\n\n292\n00:13:47.177 --> 00:13:49.241\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so, everything so\nfar has been really high level.\n\n293\n00:13:49.241 --> 00:13:49.833\nRight?\n\n294\n00:13:49.833 --> 00:13:51.673\nI'm talking about,\nit'd be nice if we have RFID tag.\n\n295\n00:13:51.673 --> 00:13:52.337\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n296\n00:13:52.337 --> 00:13:53.729\n&gt;&gt; Well, who sells that?\n\n297\n00:13:53.729 --> 00:13:58.313\nWho makes that available and am I certain\nof this technology is really available?\n\n298\n00:13:58.313 --> 00:13:59.465\nLike a smart mirror, right?\n\n299\n00:13:59.465 --> 00:14:01.980\nI've not seen a smart mirror in person.\n\n300\n00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.908\nI know about them, I've read about them,\nI've seen videos on the internet about\n\n301\n00:14:04.908 --> 00:14:07.517\nthem, but I've never seen one in person,\nso is it ready for Primetime?\n\n302\n00:14:07.517 --> 00:14:10.228\nAnd that's where the Track Step comes in.\n\n303\n00:14:10.228 --> 00:14:13.977\nRemember, with the Track Step, we're\nseeking out the relevant technologies,\n\n304\n00:14:13.977 --> 00:14:17.419\nwe're trying to find, is there something\nout there that meets this need?\n\n305\n00:14:17.419 --> 00:14:19.453\nNow we're already looking at IOT.\n\n306\n00:14:19.453 --> 00:14:21.445\nIs it ready for prime time?\n\n307\n00:14:21.445 --> 00:14:24.237\nAnd that's where our hype cycle comes in.\n\n308\n00:14:24.237 --> 00:14:28.635\nSo, we try and identify where in\nthe hype cycle this is, so IoT, well IoT\n\n309\n00:14:28.635 --> 00:14:33.396\nis big business right now, so we can kinda\nhunt around on here and find it in this\n\n310\n00:14:33.396 --> 00:14:38.263\ndiagram, oops, if I can stay on the slide\nthere, we can find it in the diagram.\n\n311\n00:14:38.263 --> 00:14:44.742\nAnd I can see that it's on the way up\nto the peak of inflated expectations.\n\n312\n00:14:44.742 --> 00:14:49.512\nNow, if I was a type B or\na type C company, I might look at that and\n\n313\n00:14:49.512 --> 00:14:54.658\nsay Alright [LAUGH] it's still\nbuilding these false expectations.\n\n314\n00:14:54.658 --> 00:14:58.390\nI know I've got this trough\nof disillusionment where and\n\n315\n00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:02.525\nwe're gonna realize this thing\nisn't as great as it could be.\n\n316\n00:15:02.525 --> 00:15:04.168\nI might shy away from this.\n\n317\n00:15:04.168 --> 00:15:07.832\nBut remember that Dapper Inc is a Type A.\n\n318\n00:15:07.832 --> 00:15:09.504\nThey don't mind taking risks.\n\n319\n00:15:09.504 --> 00:15:13.729\nThey know that IoT might turn out to be\nnothing, and that five years from now,\n\n320\n00:15:13.729 --> 00:15:18.019\nwe're all laughing about these junk\ndevices we've got all over the place that\n\n321\n00:15:18.019 --> 00:15:19.730\njust really never panned out.\n\n322\n00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:21.696\nThey're okay with that,\nthey'll take that risk.\n\n323\n00:15:21.696 --> 00:15:22.843\nIf we look at this and\n\n324\n00:15:22.843 --> 00:15:26.570\nsee that it's on the way up,\nwe just need to set our expectation.\n\n325\n00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:27.114\nIt's all right.\n\n326\n00:15:27.114 --> 00:15:28.546\nThere is a chance that we\ncould be disappointed.\n\n327\n00:15:28.546 --> 00:15:31.887\nBut we're okay, we're gonna accept\nthat risk and let's try and\n\n328\n00:15:31.887 --> 00:15:34.519\nmake sure we're as realistic\nas possible at this.\n\n329\n00:15:34.519 --> 00:15:39.169\nSo, with IOT, I know there are smart\nmirrors out there and they sound awesome.\n\n330\n00:15:39.169 --> 00:15:41.198\nAnd I wanna have that for my customers.\n\n331\n00:15:41.198 --> 00:15:45.771\nBut, I know that they might not\ncome off in practice as well as\n\n332\n00:15:45.771 --> 00:15:47.664\nthere being marketing.\n\n333\n00:15:47.664 --> 00:15:49.486\nSo we just need to take precautions for\nthat.\n\n334\n00:15:49.486 --> 00:15:51.199\nAnd sometimes it's okay, right?\n\n335\n00:15:51.199 --> 00:15:52.774\nAnd we saw those with BitCoin.\n\n336\n00:15:52.774 --> 00:15:55.747\nWhere when BitCoin came up a lot\nof websites jumped on there,\n\n337\n00:15:55.747 --> 00:15:58.737\nthe big ones were saying we'll\naccept BitCoin for payment.\n\n338\n00:15:58.737 --> 00:16:01.463\nAnd for a few months, I've got impressed.\n\n339\n00:16:01.463 --> 00:16:04.800\nSuch a company now accept BitCoin,\nyou get marketing out of it.\n\n340\n00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:09.803\nAnd then another six months later and most\nof them had removed the BitCoin payment.\n\n341\n00:16:09.803 --> 00:16:12.312\nYou might look at that as\na failed deployment, but\n\n342\n00:16:12.312 --> 00:16:15.142\nat the end of the day they got\na lot of marketing out of it.\n\n343\n00:16:15.142 --> 00:16:19.920\nAnd maybe that's all you're trying to do,\nis gain marketing, gain more customers,\n\n344\n00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:24.646\nbut if we looked at Dapper's goals, their\ngoals weren't to have a ton of customers.\n\n345\n00:16:24.646 --> 00:16:26.292\nTheir goals contributed to that, right?\n\n346\n00:16:26.292 --> 00:16:28.103\nIf we're the dominant\nplayer in our marketplace,\n\n347\n00:16:28.103 --> 00:16:29.925\nwe're obviously going to\nhave a lot of customers.\n\n348\n00:16:29.925 --> 00:16:32.788\nBut their goal was to create\na unique customer experience,\n\n349\n00:16:32.788 --> 00:16:34.742\nnot necessarily to get more customers.\n\n350\n00:16:34.742 --> 00:16:38.095\nTo bring in great talent,\nnot necessarily get more sales.\n\n351\n00:16:38.095 --> 00:16:41.139\nWe need one to bring in the other,\nbut that wasn't their primary focus.\n\n352\n00:16:41.139 --> 00:16:43.851\nSo in this case, we can look at it and\nsay, you know what?\n\n353\n00:16:43.851 --> 00:16:46.339\nThis isn't a good risk point right here,\nbut we're gonna go ahead and\n\n354\n00:16:46.339 --> 00:16:47.400\naccept it, but we'll take.\n\n355\n00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.856\nIt's not as bad as if it was way back\nat the innovation trigger side, right?\n\n356\n00:16:50.856 --> 00:16:53.203\nCuz then we don't even know if\nit's ever gonna be possible,\n\n357\n00:16:53.203 --> 00:16:54.871\nlike this equipment might never be built.\n\n358\n00:16:54.871 --> 00:16:58.342\nAt least at this point, at the peak of\ninflated expectations, prototypes should\n\n359\n00:16:58.342 --> 00:17:01.787\nbe made, should be available, we can go\nwhen we can see, and take a look at them.\n\n360\n00:17:01.787 --> 00:17:07.553\nSo once we get through this track step, we\nstart to get an idea of what's available,\n\n361\n00:17:07.553 --> 00:17:10.248\nand whether it lines up with our goals.\n\n362\n00:17:10.248 --> 00:17:13.670\nWe reach out and\nlook here to see our hype cycle phase, and\n\n363\n00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:17.662\nnow we can recognize where we're at,\nand we can accept that risk,\n\n364\n00:17:17.662 --> 00:17:21.752\nand start to move forward and\nlook for an actual tangible solution.\n\n365\n00:17:21.752 --> 00:17:25.514\nWe still haven't found a tangible solution\nhere, it's really just the idea of IoT but\n\n366\n00:17:25.514 --> 00:17:28.828\nwe're comfortable with where it's at,\nand we're ready to move forward.\n\n367\n00:17:28.828 --> 00:17:31.393\n&gt;&gt; Well Don, how do we pick between\nall of these wonderful options that\n\n368\n00:17:31.393 --> 00:17:32.166\nthey've given us?\n\n369\n00:17:32.166 --> 00:17:33.567\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n370\n00:17:33.567 --> 00:17:38.152\nnow we start getting into rank,\nright, the ranking side of things.\n\n371\n00:17:38.152 --> 00:17:41.534\nAnd what we need to do is in\nthe scope [INAUDIBLE], sorry,\n\n372\n00:17:41.534 --> 00:17:44.307\nin the track phase, we're tracking, right.\n\n373\n00:17:44.307 --> 00:17:49.123\nWe're looking for these solutions,\nand we'll come up with a list.\n\n374\n00:17:49.123 --> 00:17:52.118\nFor example, it might be\na something like a Smart Mirror or\n\n375\n00:17:52.118 --> 00:17:53.532\nit might be broader terms.\n\n376\n00:17:53.532 --> 00:17:56.704\nIn the IoT world there's a bunch\nlike this, the Smart Store,\n\n377\n00:17:56.704 --> 00:18:01.158\nthe Smart Warehouse, the Smart Customer,\nthe Smart Transportation I mentioned like\n\n378\n00:18:01.158 --> 00:18:03.609\nchecking inventory before\nyou go to the store.\n\n379\n00:18:03.609 --> 00:18:06.085\nA customer can look on the app,\nthat would be smart customer, right?\n\n380\n00:18:06.085 --> 00:18:08.684\nSomething that improves that experience.\n\n381\n00:18:08.684 --> 00:18:11.307\nSmart warehouse,\nbeing able to track inventory, or\n\n382\n00:18:11.307 --> 00:18:13.123\nif our ID tags really help with that.\n\n383\n00:18:13.123 --> 00:18:14.420\nSmart transportation.\n\n384\n00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:19.172\nWhen we have trucks that are delivering to\nstores, they can calculate the routes out.\n\n385\n00:18:19.172 --> 00:18:22.758\nUPS did this with the amount of right\nturns versus left turns their trucks took\n\n386\n00:18:22.758 --> 00:18:26.401\nand they made their delivery cycles go\na lot faster because they would only take\n\n387\n00:18:26.401 --> 00:18:27.082\nright turns.\n\n388\n00:18:27.082 --> 00:18:28.386\nAnd you can turn right on a red.\n\n389\n00:18:28.386 --> 00:18:31.248\nYou can't turn left on a red light,\nso it optimized things.\n\n390\n00:18:31.248 --> 00:18:34.305\nThese are all areas where we\nmight be able to improve.\n\n391\n00:18:34.305 --> 00:18:37.588\nAnd as we identify solution providers for\nthese, right,\n\n392\n00:18:37.588 --> 00:18:40.071\nthere's a bunch of them\nthat are out there.\n\n393\n00:18:40.071 --> 00:18:42.580\nEspecially with IoT being\na hot buzz word right now.\n\n394\n00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:45.017\nOkay.\nThere's organizations like\n\n395\n00:18:45.017 --> 00:18:46.457\nTelit Smart Retail.\n\n396\n00:18:46.457 --> 00:18:49.373\nAnd I actually got a lot of these,\nlet me pull up their webpages here.\n\n397\n00:18:49.373 --> 00:18:49.984\nThere we go.\n\n398\n00:18:49.984 --> 00:18:54.967\nWhoops, you got me zooming\naround like crazy.\n\n399\n00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:56.530\nYou've got Telit, right?\n\n400\n00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:57.475\nThey do Smart Retail.\n\n401\n00:18:57.475 --> 00:19:02.406\nThey have a full solution or a full suite\nof products you can use to get things.\n\n402\n00:19:02.406 --> 00:19:04.775\nThey've got the platform and\nsoftware to drive all this.\n\n403\n00:19:04.775 --> 00:19:07.902\nThey've got the modules and the hardware,\nand then they've go connectivity and\n\n404\n00:19:07.902 --> 00:19:08.817\nwireless technology.\n\n405\n00:19:08.817 --> 00:19:10.634\nIt has allowed all these devices to talk.\n\n406\n00:19:10.634 --> 00:19:13.730\nThis is one place we can go to\ntry to get everything provided.\n\n407\n00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:17.070\nBut, there are big names in this industry,\ntoo, like Intel.\n\n408\n00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:18.852\nIntel has some really impressive stuff.\n\n409\n00:19:18.852 --> 00:19:22.133\nIf you ever get bored, go to their site\ncuz they've got a video on here about\n\n410\n00:19:22.133 --> 00:19:25.258\na pair of blue jeans and the blue jeans\ntells you its story as it kinda goes\n\n411\n00:19:25.258 --> 00:19:27.834\nthrough it's process of ending\nup on somebody's floor.\n\n412\n00:19:27.834 --> 00:19:30.578\n[LAUGH] So Intel is in it.\n\n413\n00:19:30.578 --> 00:19:32.027\nIBM Watson.\n\n414\n00:19:32.027 --> 00:19:34.033\nRight, everybody hears about Watson,\n\n415\n00:19:34.033 --> 00:19:36.753\nthe thinking computer that\ncan beat anybody in chess.\n\n416\n00:19:36.753 --> 00:19:38.773\nWell, it's also good at\nordering blue jeans.\n\n417\n00:19:38.773 --> 00:19:41.629\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so it says right here,\n\n418\n00:19:41.629 --> 00:19:46.143\nthey can turn a brick and mortar store\ninto digital competitors, right?\n\n419\n00:19:46.143 --> 00:19:49.620\nThis is exactly what\nDapper is looking for.\n\n420\n00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:53.569\nThey've got brick and mortar stores,\nthey want to adopt IoT, IBM is\n\n421\n00:19:53.569 --> 00:19:58.350\nsaying they can do it, and they've got\nWatson, which is a really big AI platform.\n\n422\n00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:59.496\nThis ties into other areas.\n\n423\n00:19:59.496 --> 00:20:01.680\nIf we go back to our hype cycle,\nwe'll find AI on there, too.\n\n424\n00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.746\nSo we can get into more than one point.\n\n425\n00:20:03.746 --> 00:20:06.656\nThis might be the great solution.\n\n426\n00:20:06.656 --> 00:20:09.199\nBut going back to Daniel's question,\nhow do I pick which one I wanna go with?\n\n427\n00:20:09.199 --> 00:20:13.961\nAll right, maybe Itel or, Intel,\nIBM, they're all big names.\n\n428\n00:20:13.961 --> 00:20:15.291\nWhich one do I go with?\n\n429\n00:20:15.291 --> 00:20:18.538\nAnd that's where rank comes in.\n\n430\n00:20:18.538 --> 00:20:21.503\nAnd with rank,\nwe have to look at each one and\n\n431\n00:20:21.503 --> 00:20:26.082\nwe have to figure out which one it\nis that's going to meet our needs.\n\n432\n00:20:26.082 --> 00:20:30.156\nAnd if we remember the definition of rank,\nwe're considering alternative candidates.\n\n433\n00:20:30.156 --> 00:20:31.699\nAnd ranking the technologies.\n\n434\n00:20:31.699 --> 00:20:35.121\nSo, we need to come up with what we\ncall the cutoff threshold, right,\n\n435\n00:20:35.121 --> 00:20:36.230\nthe spider diagrams.\n\n436\n00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:40.154\nSo at Dapper, the team sits down, the\nemerging technology group sits down, and\n\n437\n00:20:40.154 --> 00:20:42.184\nthey start to come up with their cutoffs.\n\n438\n00:20:42.184 --> 00:20:49.319\nWe want to deploy IoT but if we do,\nwe need it to be aligned with our scope.\n\n439\n00:20:49.319 --> 00:20:52.369\nAnd so you'll see I've weighted\nscope a little heavily there, right,\n\n440\n00:20:52.369 --> 00:20:53.170\nthree out of five.\n\n441\n00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:56.872\nAnd then I want my benefit to\nbe three out of five or more.\n\n442\n00:20:56.872 --> 00:20:59.207\nI need to see some benefits\nout of this technology.\n\n443\n00:20:59.207 --> 00:21:01.439\nSometimes we invest in\nthings that don't benefit.\n\n444\n00:21:01.439 --> 00:21:03.446\nBut in this case,\nit's to make a customer experience better.\n\n445\n00:21:03.446 --> 00:21:04.778\nI need to benefit.\n\n446\n00:21:04.778 --> 00:21:07.069\nChampions, we can always\nbring in champions,\n\n447\n00:21:07.069 --> 00:21:10.735\nso we'll weight that a little bit lower\nat two our of five current activity,\n\n448\n00:21:10.735 --> 00:21:13.275\nI'm not too worried about\nthis space being active.\n\n449\n00:21:13.275 --> 00:21:15.896\nMostly because it's,\nwell it's a big buzz word.\n\n450\n00:21:15.896 --> 00:21:16.945\nExtremely active.\n\n451\n00:21:16.945 --> 00:21:18.984\nBut we've set that to a 2 out of 5.\n\n452\n00:21:18.984 --> 00:21:21.986\nLow risk set that at a 0.5 really low.\n\n453\n00:21:21.986 --> 00:21:22.603\n&gt;&gt; Don't care.\n\n454\n00:21:22.603 --> 00:21:23.688\n&gt;&gt; We don't care,\nwe know this is a high risk.\n\n455\n00:21:23.688 --> 00:21:25.249\nAnd we're accepting of that so\n\n456\n00:21:25.249 --> 00:21:28.080\nI'm not really worried about\nwhere that risk falls in.\n\n457\n00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.890\nLoad time to value,\nthat's a different story right?\n\n458\n00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:32.390\nIf we're investing in this,\n\n459\n00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:35.390\nhow long can we wait before we\nstart making money back on it?\n\n460\n00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:39.757\nNow because this is a large organization\nwe've got the company coffers we've got\n\n461\n00:21:39.757 --> 00:21:42.486\nthe money to invest and so\nthat can be weighted low.\n\n462\n00:21:42.486 --> 00:21:45.750\nBut if you are a small or medium\nbusiness you need to crank this up and\n\n463\n00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:48.095\nin this case dapper\nthey've got the war chest.\n\n464\n00:21:48.095 --> 00:21:52.680\nLow cost well being cutting edge is\nexpensive so we've accepting of that.\n\n465\n00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.834\nAnd that's a low too.\n\n466\n00:21:53.834 --> 00:21:55.412\nAnd then current maturity.\n\n467\n00:21:55.412 --> 00:21:59.731\nWe just dropped that right off the meter,\nset that at zero, because we know we're\n\n468\n00:21:59.731 --> 00:22:04.071\nlooking for something cutting edge, that\nis not necessarily going to be mature.\n\n469\n00:22:04.071 --> 00:22:06.749\nIn fact, we might be influencing\na design of that technology if\n\n470\n00:22:06.749 --> 00:22:08.778\nwe're the first to market\nwith smart mirrors.\n\n471\n00:22:08.778 --> 00:22:12.702\nThen the behavior of those mirrors\nmight change based off our results.\n\n472\n00:22:12.702 --> 00:22:14.505\nWe are willing to accept that.\n\n473\n00:22:14.505 --> 00:22:17.625\nRemember, we are type A, so\nwe are going to accept that.\n\n474\n00:22:17.625 --> 00:22:20.571\n&gt;&gt; Well Don, it seems like we have\nnarrowed the field down quite a bit.\n\n475\n00:22:20.571 --> 00:22:23.418\nBut we have yet to really put\na finger on \"there's our solution.\"\n\n476\n00:22:23.418 --> 00:22:24.109\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n477\n00:22:24.109 --> 00:22:26.352\nWhat we need to do is take\neach of the solutions.\n\n478\n00:22:26.352 --> 00:22:32.656\nI can take Telet, and Intel, and\nIBM I can weight them on this scale.\n\n479\n00:22:32.656 --> 00:22:34.569\nSo I come up with their lineup.\n\n480\n00:22:34.569 --> 00:22:37.058\nSo say this is intel\nsmart retail right here.\n\n481\n00:22:37.058 --> 00:22:40.359\nAnd I can lay my cutoff\nthreshold on top of it.\n\n482\n00:22:40.359 --> 00:22:46.814\nAs long as the intel map is wrapped\naround that cutoff threshold Then Intel\n\n483\n00:22:46.814 --> 00:22:51.477\nis now an innovation candidate, we-\n&gt;&gt; We don't want opposite to be true?\n\n484\n00:22:51.477 --> 00:22:53.188\n&gt;&gt; If it's beneath on\nany of these categories,\n\n485\n00:22:53.188 --> 00:22:56.216\nif it's beneath that threshold,\nnow we've got a problem, we don't want it.\n\n486\n00:22:56.216 --> 00:23:00.973\nAnd so maybe for some reason Telit doesn't\nmeet our needs in one particular area, so\n\n487\n00:23:00.973 --> 00:23:02.383\nwe cut them out, right?\n\n488\n00:23:02.383 --> 00:23:06.130\nBut you might still be left with multiple,\nI might be still left with Intel and IBM.\n\n489\n00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:07.464\nSo let's say that's the case, right?\n\n490\n00:23:07.464 --> 00:23:09.807\nWe're left with Intel and IBM.\n\n491\n00:23:09.807 --> 00:23:10.576\nNow how do we pick it?\n\n492\n00:23:10.576 --> 00:23:12.352\nThey both met our cutoff threshold.\n\n493\n00:23:12.352 --> 00:23:15.980\nAnd one might be noticeably\nstronger than another.\n\n494\n00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:18.285\nWell let's just say\nthey're completely equal.\n\n495\n00:23:18.285 --> 00:23:23.330\nI map out Intel, I map out IBM, and\nthey both look exactly like this.\n\n496\n00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:25.127\n&gt;&gt; And so we whip out the coin,\nand [LAUGH].\n\n497\n00:23:25.127 --> 00:23:28.563\n&gt;&gt; Sadly, business decisions have\nbeen made on less, but [LAUGH].\n\n498\n00:23:28.563 --> 00:23:29.640\n&gt;&gt; It's true, it's true.\n\n499\n00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.803\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Bu really we move into that evaluation.\n\n500\n00:23:31.803 --> 00:23:32.395\nEvaluate stage.\n\n501\n00:23:32.395 --> 00:23:35.735\nAnd evaluate is where we do the research,\nright.\n\n502\n00:23:35.735 --> 00:23:38.616\nThis is where we engage with Intel,\nwe engage with IBM.\n\n503\n00:23:38.616 --> 00:23:40.486\nWe say, hey, can you send us a prototype?\n\n504\n00:23:40.486 --> 00:23:41.990\nCan you come into a demonstration?\n\n505\n00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:43.463\nCan you send some consultance?\n\n506\n00:23:43.463 --> 00:23:44.526\nAnd let's walk it through.\n\n507\n00:23:44.526 --> 00:23:45.204\nAnd let's talk about it.\n\n508\n00:23:45.204 --> 00:23:47.532\nLet's come up with a financial number and\nfigure it out exactly.\n\n509\n00:23:47.532 --> 00:23:50.729\nCuz everything we've done so\nfar is based on just industry data.\n\n510\n00:23:50.729 --> 00:23:51.385\nRight?\nAnd\n\n511\n00:23:51.385 --> 00:23:55.333\nif you have like a Gardner subscription\nyou can pull industry data and\n\n512\n00:23:55.333 --> 00:23:57.999\nsee kind of like an average\nacross companies.\n\n513\n00:23:57.999 --> 00:24:01.094\nThat means that you might be below or\nabove those averages.\n\n514\n00:24:01.094 --> 00:24:03.416\nYou have a good number to base\nyour initial decisions on.\n\n515\n00:24:03.416 --> 00:24:07.584\nBut your final decision needs to be\nbased on things like actual quotes,\n\n516\n00:24:07.584 --> 00:24:09.888\nactual implementation information.\n\n517\n00:24:09.888 --> 00:24:14.248\nAnd so we need to move forward with\nevaluating, where we actually investigate\n\n518\n00:24:14.248 --> 00:24:19.151\nthe top-ranked candidates, and figure out\nwhat a real deployment is gonna look like.\n\n519\n00:24:19.151 --> 00:24:23.907\nWe get our operational managers to start\ncreating process workflows and say,\n\n520\n00:24:23.907 --> 00:24:27.519\nthis is how I would implement\nthis inside of my department.\n\n521\n00:24:27.519 --> 00:24:29.801\nOr how my people would change\nthe way they do work, and\n\n522\n00:24:29.801 --> 00:24:31.647\nhere's the results I would expect to get.\n\n523\n00:24:31.647 --> 00:24:35.748\nAnd once you do that,\nyou may find that back here in our\n\n524\n00:24:35.748 --> 00:24:39.678\nspider diagram that they\nmight have looked equal.\n\n525\n00:24:39.678 --> 00:24:44.355\nBut when you actually apply it to your\ncompany specifically in the evaluate step,\n\n526\n00:24:44.355 --> 00:24:47.769\nthat that's where you start\nto find things aren't equal.\n\n527\n00:24:47.769 --> 00:24:51.834\nThere are differences, and\nnow you start to get a market leader.\n\n528\n00:24:51.834 --> 00:24:55.916\nAnd worst case scenario, if everything is\ntied even after all the evaluation and\n\n529\n00:24:55.916 --> 00:24:59.037\neverything is the same,\nthen you just beat them up on price and\n\n530\n00:24:59.037 --> 00:25:00.732\ngo with who's cheaper, right?\n\n531\n00:25:00.732 --> 00:25:02.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n532\n00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.372\nI can't think of a scenario where\nthat's ever happened to me.\n\n533\n00:25:04.372 --> 00:25:09.182\nThere's always somebody who, maybe\nthey've got a better a salesperson, but\n\n534\n00:25:09.182 --> 00:25:13.296\ncan provide a better service or\nbetter commitment to your success.\n\n535\n00:25:13.296 --> 00:25:14.533\nAnd that's what we look for,\n\n536\n00:25:14.533 --> 00:25:17.711\nbecause we want this all to contribute\nway back to the goal at the beginning.\n\n537\n00:25:17.711 --> 00:25:22.254\nAnd that's what Dapper's gonna do here, is\nreach out to these vendors, bring them in,\n\n538\n00:25:22.254 --> 00:25:25.963\nand start to get that going, a prototype,\na model, maybe even a pilot.\n\n539\n00:25:25.963 --> 00:25:29.476\nSo I might have 1,000 stores,\nand I take 10 stores, and\n\n540\n00:25:29.476 --> 00:25:31.410\nwe say that's gonna be our pilot.\n\n541\n00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:33.505\nSo let's roll out Internet\nthings in those 10 stores.\n\n542\n00:25:33.505 --> 00:25:37.096\nAnd if it completely flops and it's\nbotched, then it's okay, we only did that\n\n543\n00:25:37.096 --> 00:25:40.921\nminor investment, we can just pull it back\nout of those 10 stores and we're done.\n\n544\n00:25:40.921 --> 00:25:43.546\nBut if it's a success,\nnow we roll forward,\n\n545\n00:25:43.546 --> 00:25:46.239\nwe dump it out into all\nthe other branches, and\n\n546\n00:25:46.239 --> 00:25:51.377\nthen we get our marketing campaign ramped\nup, look, we've got this amazing support.\n\n547\n00:25:51.377 --> 00:25:55.236\nAnd if you think about other technologies\nlike Apple Pay, they went through that\n\n548\n00:25:55.236 --> 00:25:59.051\nexact process, where Apple Pay was just\nat a couple of stores in the beginning.\n\n549\n00:25:59.051 --> 00:26:01.671\nAnd now they're trying to get\nin as many places as they can.\n\n550\n00:26:01.671 --> 00:26:02.754\nIt's all part of the process.\n\n551\n00:26:02.754 --> 00:26:07.504\nThat's exactly how Dapper can handle that\nright here to get this out into the field.\n\n552\n00:26:07.504 --> 00:26:11.293\n&gt;&gt; All right, Don, now that we've used\nall these techniques up to this point to\n\n553\n00:26:11.293 --> 00:26:13.801\nfigure out exactly what\nour solution's gonna be,\n\n554\n00:26:13.801 --> 00:26:17.906\nwe've decided this is the one we're gonna\ngo with, how does it play out from here?\n\n555\n00:26:17.906 --> 00:26:19.249\n&gt;&gt; All right, that brings us\nto our last two steps, right?\n\n556\n00:26:19.249 --> 00:26:20.497\nWe've got to evangelize.\n\n557\n00:26:20.497 --> 00:26:25.123\nSo now that they've decided\nthey're gonna go for it.\n\n558\n00:26:25.123 --> 00:26:28.480\nWe'll stick with smart mirrors, so we're\ndefinitely gonna go with smart mirrors.\n\n559\n00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.523\nWe tried it out in a couple of stores,\nwe did a pilot in 10 stores.\n\n560\n00:26:31.523 --> 00:26:33.923\nThe customers loved it,\nthe employees loved it,\n\n561\n00:26:33.923 --> 00:26:37.593\nbecause what do employees at a retail\nstore have to do a lot of times, right?\n\n562\n00:26:37.593 --> 00:26:38.386\n&gt;&gt; Put clothes away.\n\n563\n00:26:38.386 --> 00:26:42.203\n&gt;&gt; Gotta put them back, yeah, people\nleave them in the fitting room and, man,\n\n564\n00:26:42.203 --> 00:26:44.459\nthey're folded so nicely from the factory.\n\n565\n00:26:44.459 --> 00:26:48.204\nI've tried on a lot of shirts in my days,\nand I could never fold them the same way,\n\n566\n00:26:48.204 --> 00:26:50.203\nbut those employees have to do it, right?\n\n567\n00:26:50.203 --> 00:26:53.337\nSo the smart mirror makes their\njob easier, they're happy.\n\n568\n00:26:53.337 --> 00:26:54.711\nThe customer's having a great experience.\n\n569\n00:26:54.711 --> 00:26:58.232\nIf we go way back to our goals\nfrom the very beginning, right,\n\n570\n00:26:58.232 --> 00:27:01.554\nthe smart mirrors give\nthe customers a great experience,\n\n571\n00:27:01.554 --> 00:27:04.967\nthey allow us to be a market\nleader in shopping technology.\n\n572\n00:27:04.967 --> 00:27:07.852\nYou might be one of the first people\nto roll out the smart mirror, and\n\n573\n00:27:07.852 --> 00:27:09.532\nhave it right there for the customers.\n\n574\n00:27:09.532 --> 00:27:12.437\nIt attracts better talent,\nemployees want to come work for\n\n575\n00:27:12.437 --> 00:27:15.574\nus because they know they can\nspend time helping customers, and\n\n576\n00:27:15.574 --> 00:27:18.909\nnot spend time folding clothes,\nright, and help people that way.\n\n577\n00:27:18.909 --> 00:27:23.142\nAnd it improves efficiencies in all\nprocedures because we don't have people\n\n578\n00:27:23.142 --> 00:27:24.713\nwaiting in changing rooms.\n\n579\n00:27:24.713 --> 00:27:28.173\nAnd if they try a virtual shirt on,\nand then we don't have the size,\n\n580\n00:27:28.173 --> 00:27:31.819\nwell, they've already got the shirt\npulled up in the virtual system,\n\n581\n00:27:31.819 --> 00:27:35.742\nso it'd be easy enough to do an order\nright there, and have it get deployed.\n\n582\n00:27:35.742 --> 00:27:40.191\nSo we really hit all of our goals with\nsmart mirrors, it's a great technology.\n\n583\n00:27:40.191 --> 00:27:42.945\nSo what we need to do then is evangelize.\n\n584\n00:27:42.945 --> 00:27:45.754\nWe need to create a training\nprogram inside of our company,\n\n585\n00:27:45.754 --> 00:27:49.197\nto train the employees, so they know\nexactly what the smart mirrors do.\n\n586\n00:27:49.197 --> 00:27:51.875\nAnd how great they can be, and\nhow they can help the customers.\n\n587\n00:27:51.875 --> 00:27:55.022\nYou don't want a customer to come in and\nsay, what's that thing on the wall, and\n\n588\n00:27:55.022 --> 00:27:56.798\nan employee says, that's some new gadget.\n\n589\n00:27:56.798 --> 00:27:57.678\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know how to use it.\n\n590\n00:27:57.678 --> 00:27:59.434\nCome on, I'll show you where\nthe changing room is, right?\n\n591\n00:27:59.434 --> 00:28:01.458\nCuz they already know how to\nuse the changing room, but\n\n592\n00:28:01.458 --> 00:28:03.576\nthis new technology might be\na little more challenging.\n\n593\n00:28:03.576 --> 00:28:06.730\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot of kickback\nfrom the end user experience,\n\n594\n00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:10.756\nas far as maybe your employee is from,\nbecause they don't like change.\n\n595\n00:28:10.756 --> 00:28:12.446\nThey know their job, and\nbecause they know their job,\n\n596\n00:28:12.446 --> 00:28:13.785\nthey feel like they're really good at it.\n\n597\n00:28:13.785 --> 00:28:17.871\nAnd if you start throwing monkey wrenches\nat it, they can get a little uptight and\n\n598\n00:28:17.871 --> 00:28:19.266\nresistant to that change.\n\n599\n00:28:19.266 --> 00:28:21.101\n&gt;&gt; And any trip to the grocery\nstore will show you that,\n\n600\n00:28:21.101 --> 00:28:23.242\nwhere there's the self checkout\nlanes that might be empty.\n\n601\n00:28:23.242 --> 00:28:26.590\nAnd then you've got five people waiting in\nline for the one cashier that's there just\n\n602\n00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:29.300\nbecause they'd rather have that cashier,\npeople do that, right?\n\n603\n00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:31.935\nBut if we can take a moment and\nsay, you know what?\n\n604\n00:28:31.935 --> 00:28:32.654\nLet me walk you over here.\n\n605\n00:28:32.654 --> 00:28:35.233\nI'm gonna show you how this self\ncheckout lane works, and you help.\n\n606\n00:28:35.233 --> 00:28:38.637\nSo we need evangelists,\nwe need people to promote that, and\n\n607\n00:28:38.637 --> 00:28:42.039\nso the ETG will find usually one\nperson kind of up at the helm,\n\n608\n00:28:42.039 --> 00:28:45.137\nusually it is like the key\nstakeholder in the project.\n\n609\n00:28:45.137 --> 00:28:48.163\nAnd then they will in turn create\nmore of these evangelists and\n\n610\n00:28:48.163 --> 00:28:49.917\nstart to promote it in the company.\n\n611\n00:28:49.917 --> 00:28:52.832\nAnd once that's done,\nwe're done as an ETG.\n\n612\n00:28:52.832 --> 00:28:55.177\nThe smart mirrors are now\nbeing rolled out.\n\n613\n00:28:55.177 --> 00:28:58.245\nWe've got people who are promoting them\nand training the other employees, and\n\n614\n00:28:58.245 --> 00:28:59.819\nthe customers are starting to use them.\n\n615\n00:28:59.819 --> 00:29:03.810\nSo we transfer ownership of this over to\nsomeone in the operational department,\n\n616\n00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:06.404\nright, somebody who's in\nthe retail operations.\n\n617\n00:29:06.404 --> 00:29:08.949\nAnd say, all right, that's it,\nyou've got smart mirrors.\n\n618\n00:29:08.949 --> 00:29:11.427\nWe're gonna go and\nlook for the next thing.\n\n619\n00:29:11.427 --> 00:29:15.295\nAnd so now the ETG for\nDapper goes back, and it says okay,\n\n620\n00:29:15.295 --> 00:29:19.244\nlet's jump all the way back to scope and\nlook at our goals,\n\n621\n00:29:19.244 --> 00:29:22.645\nand what out there is gonna\nhelp us with our goals?\n\n622\n00:29:22.645 --> 00:29:25.182\nAnd they can just jump to the hype cycle\nand look at all the things that are coming\n\n623\n00:29:25.182 --> 00:29:26.768\nup and say,\ndo any of these align with our goals?\n\n624\n00:29:26.768 --> 00:29:29.714\nAnd they start picking that next\nproject and moving forward.\n\n625\n00:29:29.714 --> 00:29:33.935\nAll right, so that's how the process\nwould run for an organization like this,\n\n626\n00:29:33.935 --> 00:29:37.652\nas they move from learning about\na technology, all the way to actually\n\n627\n00:29:37.652 --> 00:29:41.815\naccepting that new innovation and\nhaving it deployed in their organization.\n\n628\n00:29:41.815 --> 00:29:43.829\nThe STREET process walks\nthrough the whole thing.\n\n629\n00:29:43.829 --> 00:29:46.387\nAnd remember that at\nany step along the way,\n\n630\n00:29:46.387 --> 00:29:48.888\nwe could have decided\nthat it was a bad fit.\n\n631\n00:29:48.888 --> 00:29:52.883\nAnd said, that's just not really gonna\nimprove our customer experience, or\n\n632\n00:29:52.883 --> 00:29:55.316\nit's not really gonna\nmake us a market leader.\n\n633\n00:29:55.316 --> 00:29:58.037\nAnd you choose not to adopt,\nyou stop, and it goes away.\n\n634\n00:29:58.037 --> 00:30:01.926\nBut in this case, smart mirrors are a\nperfect fit for a retail clothing outlet,\n\n635\n00:30:01.926 --> 00:30:03.330\nand here, it all works out.\n\n636\n00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:06.856\n&gt;&gt; Well, Don, this was a great second\nlook into the Gartner STREET process.\n\n637\n00:30:06.856 --> 00:30:10.144\nIt always helps to have that\ncontext around a concept to give it\n\n638\n00:30:10.144 --> 00:30:12.928\nmore tangibility for\nus to retain that knowledge and\n\n639\n00:30:12.928 --> 00:30:14.838\nbe able to use it in a practical way.\n\n640\n00:30:14.838 --> 00:30:17.089\nWe do appreciate your time and\neffort on putting that together,\n\n641\n00:30:17.089 --> 00:30:18.348\nand joining us today in the studio.\n\n642\n00:30:18.348 --> 00:30:20.561\nBut as I look at the clock,\nwe are sadly out of time.\n\n643\n00:30:20.561 --> 00:30:22.473\nBut perfect timing because you're\nat the end of your demonstration.\n\n644\n00:30:22.473 --> 00:30:23.634\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n645\n00:30:23.634 --> 00:30:24.716\n&gt;&gt; So that being said,\n\n646\n00:30:24.716 --> 00:30:27.205\nwe do thank our audience for\nwatching as well.\n\n647\n00:30:27.205 --> 00:30:31.181\nWe hope you enjoyed this
