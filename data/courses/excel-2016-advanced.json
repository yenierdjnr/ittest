00:00:12.122\nMy name is Vonne Smith, and\nin this course overview,\n\n4\n00:00:12.122 --> 00:00:14.960\nwell we're gonna be talking about\nwhat is this show all about?\n\n5\n00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.832\nWho is our target audience?\n\n6\n00:00:16.832 --> 00:00:19.505\nDo we need to know anything\nbefore we get started?\n\n7\n00:00:19.505 --> 00:00:22.191\nAnd any extra tidbits I might have for\nyou.\n\n8\n00:00:22.191 --> 00:00:24.226\nSo, what are we gonna talk about?\n\n9\n00:00:24.226 --> 00:00:27.795\nThis show is broken up\ninto four specific areas.\n\n10\n00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:31.923\nWe have analyze data, graphical elements,\ncollaborate and security, and\n\n11\n00:00:31.923 --> 00:00:33.073\nadditional topics.\n\n12\n00:00:33.073 --> 00:00:38.221\nIn the Analyze Data section we're going\nto be covering things like sorting and\n\n13\n00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:39.869\nfiltering out our data.\n\n14\n00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:43.374\nWe're also gonna be formatting in tables,\none of my favorite subjects.\n\n15\n00:00:43.374 --> 00:00:46.384\nWe'll also explore\nthe world of outlining and\n\n16\n00:00:46.384 --> 00:00:49.325\ncreating subtotals within our worksheets.\n\n17\n00:00:49.325 --> 00:00:54.602\nWe'll also be applying conditional\nformatting, formatting that goes ahead and\n\n18\n00:00:54.602 --> 00:00:58.892\napplies to specific criteria that\nyou instill and you make a rule.\n\n19\n00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:02.700\nVery powerful stuff and a lot of different\nthings that you can use to kinda\n\n20\n00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.267\njust see what is that\ninformation saying to you.\n\n21\n00:01:05.267 --> 00:01:07.933\nHow are we going to be analyzing our data.\n\n22\n00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.184\nGraphical elements,\n\n23\n00:01:09.184 --> 00:01:13.603\nwell that's where we get into some of my\nother favorite areas of adding images.\n\n24\n00:01:13.603 --> 00:01:15.982\nWe'll be adding in\nwonderful pictures of Mr.\n\n25\n00:01:15.982 --> 00:01:19.890\nFuego and Bishop, the stars of our\nshow at Christmas Cats, Incorporated.\n\n26\n00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.481\nWe'll also be adding in\nsome different shapes and\n\n27\n00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:24.772\nhow to format that will fills and\noutlines.\n\n28\n00:01:24.772 --> 00:01:27.079\nWe'll also add in SmartArt.\n\n29\n00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:27.892\nWhat is that?\n\n30\n00:01:27.892 --> 00:01:29.067\nIt's art that's smart.\n\n31\n00:01:29.067 --> 00:01:34.448\nReally, it is and it's a lot of fun and\nreally easy to use, in Excel.\n\n32\n00:01:34.448 --> 00:01:37.693\nSo, we'll be exploring those\ndifferent elements that you might\n\n33\n00:01:37.693 --> 00:01:41.006\nwant to add in to your workbooks,\njust add a little bit of pizzazz.\n\n34\n00:01:41.006 --> 00:01:45.723\nNow, is Excel the place where you're gonna\nbe doing an extensive amount of formatting\n\n35\n00:01:45.723 --> 00:01:47.088\nof graphical elements?\n\n36\n00:01:47.088 --> 00:01:50.958\nMaybe not, but everybody has different\nreasons for why they want to use Excel.\n\n37\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:55.672\nSo we will definitely be covering\nthat area within this series.\n\n38\n00:01:55.672 --> 00:01:59.247\nWe'll also be talking about\nhow to share workbooks, and\n\n39\n00:01:59.247 --> 00:02:03.428\nhow to track changes in that,\nCollaborate and Security section.\n\n40\n00:02:03.428 --> 00:02:07.266\nWe'll also go over an important\ntopic called Data Validation.\n\n41\n00:02:07.266 --> 00:02:12.219\nMaking sure that people are inputting\nin the information into your cells that\n\n42\n00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:13.368\nyou want them to.\n\n43\n00:02:13.368 --> 00:02:17.365\nAnd if they're not, let's go ahead and\nthrow them that little warning error to\n\n44\n00:02:17.365 --> 00:02:19.873\ntry to make sure that you\nvalidate the information\n\n45\n00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:23.770\nthat's going into that with some certain\nrules and locking some areas down.\n\n46\n00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.585\nSpeaking of locking down areas,\nwe're going to explore the world of\n\n47\n00:02:27.585 --> 00:02:31.741\nlocking cells and being able to protect\nour worksheets and our workbooks.\n\n48\n00:02:31.741 --> 00:02:35.537\nAnd then we'll also explore how\nto pass protect our files and\n\n49\n00:02:35.537 --> 00:02:39.335\nthen also get into the document\nproperties that includes how\n\n50\n00:02:39.335 --> 00:02:42.398\nto add those different properties or\nmetadata.\n\n51\n00:02:42.398 --> 00:02:46.636\nAlso inspect our document for hidden\ninformation and how to get rid of that.\n\n52\n00:02:46.636 --> 00:02:50.103\nAnd also explore the world\nof accessibility and\n\n53\n00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:55.485\nmaking sure that our files are accessable\nfor people with disabilities.\n\n54\n00:02:55.485 --> 00:02:56.930\nWe also have our additional topics area.\n\n55\n00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.271\nSo we were gonna just throw in some little\ntidbits like customizing our environments,\n\n56\n00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:04.185\nsome macros and some other\nthings that we will hopefully be\n\n57\n00:03:04.185 --> 00:03:07.395\nusing as an error to throw things\nin there, just as important but\n\n58\n00:03:07.395 --> 00:03:09.487\nmaybe not fall in to a specific category.\n\n59\n00:03:09.487 --> 00:03:12.371\nAnd we'll be hopefully\nbuilding that as we go.\n\n60\n00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:14.510\nSo who is this for?\n\n61\n00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.130\nAll Office users.\n\n62\n00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.069\nNow as you see, Office is with a capital\nO, and that's not meaning that you have\n\n63\n00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.831\nto be in a physical office\nlocation in a large organization,\n\n64\n00:03:24.831 --> 00:03:26.701\nit can be in your home office.\n\n65\n00:03:26.701 --> 00:03:31.451\nReally, it's Office as the products,\nthe Office Suite,\n\n66\n00:03:31.451 --> 00:03:37.158\nto where you are using Excel as part\nof the collection of applications.\n\n67\n00:03:37.158 --> 00:03:39.599\nMaybe you're using Word and\nOutlook on the same way.\n\n68\n00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.574\nSo anybody that wants to go ahead and\nexplore the world of Excel,\n\n69\n00:03:43.574 --> 00:03:46.381\nit is a little bit higher\nof a functionality.\n\n70\n00:03:46.381 --> 00:03:50.432\nAnd that's why I put intermediate\nusers to advanced users.\n\n71\n00:03:50.432 --> 00:03:55.337\nSo where these series does work\nupon the Excel Essentials series,\n\n72\n00:03:55.337 --> 00:03:58.060\nso we will be referring back to that.\n\n73\n00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.219\nSo if you haven't watch some of\nthe episodes on that particular show,\n\n74\n00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:03.906\nyou might wanna gonna go ahead and\nrefresh your knowledge.\n\n75\n00:04:03.906 --> 00:04:08.989\nBut this is also used as a stand-alone\nseries, where is you have some of\n\n76\n00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:14.516\nthat foundational knowledge, then\nyou'll be able to excel in this series.\n\n77\n00:04:14.516 --> 00:04:17.035\nAnd talking about that in a Prerequisites,\n\n78\n00:04:17.035 --> 00:04:21.198\nright there we were talking about\nthe foundational knowledge of Excel.\n\n79\n00:04:21.198 --> 00:04:24.401\nAnd then also having\na familiarity with other Office\n\n80\n00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:26.451\nproducts can always be helpful.\n\n81\n00:04:26.451 --> 00:04:31.025\nIf you know how to insert images in Word\nwell then you know how to insert images\n\n82\n00:04:31.025 --> 00:04:31.814\ninto Excel.\n\n83\n00:04:31.814 --> 00:04:36.251\nA lot of that same functionality goes\nacross all of your different applications.\n\n84\n00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:40.490\nFor example the episode that we talked\nabout documents and properties,\n\n85\n00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.102\nit's pretty much the same thing\nas in the Word or PowerPoint or\n\n86\n00:04:44.102 --> 00:04:48.429\nany of those other series that you may\nhave watch that exact same episode.\n\n87\n00:04:48.429 --> 00:04:50.428\nWell it's the same thing in Excel.\n\n88\n00:04:50.428 --> 00:04:54.324\nSo having a little bit of that knowledge\nand other places will be helpful.\n\n89\n00:04:54.324 --> 00:04:59.076\nAnd of course just knowing about how work\nwithin your Windows operating system\n\n90\n00:04:59.076 --> 00:05:02.905\nis always a good thing to know about for\nthese different shows.\n\n91\n00:05:02.905 --> 00:05:06.763\nSo some little tidbits\nthat I can give to you.\n\n92\n00:05:06.763 --> 00:05:10.420\nThere is always more than one\nway to do something in Excel.\n\n93\n00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.876\nI might cover ways one, two and three.\n\n94\n00:05:12.876 --> 00:05:16.181\nBut maybe there's a fourth and\na fifth way, that I didn't cover.\n\n95\n00:05:16.181 --> 00:05:19.877\nWell, there's a lot of information to\ncover just kinda getting the basics\n\n96\n00:05:19.877 --> 00:05:20.413\non there.\n\n97\n00:05:20.413 --> 00:05:25.420\nSo it is very possible that there is\nsome other way to do it and that's okay.\n\n98\n00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.174\nSo, and updates will happen,\n\n99\n00:05:27.174 --> 00:05:31.424\nmaybe I'm showing you something in\nthese episodes that you're like hmm,\n\n100\n00:05:31.424 --> 00:05:35.892\nI don't have that button or like maybe\nmy button looks a little bit different.\n\n101\n00:05:35.892 --> 00:05:43.214\nThat happens to your products, because\nI am using an Office 365 subscription.\n\n102\n00:05:43.214 --> 00:05:47.647\nIf you're not on a subscription base,\nthat's where things might look a little\n\n103\n00:05:47.647 --> 00:05:52.213\ndifferent there, because there are certain\nelements that are only available for\n\n104\n00:05:52.213 --> 00:05:53.884\nOffice 365 subscribers.\n\n105\n00:05:53.884 --> 00:05:57.611\nJust one other note on that\nparticular subject is that we\n\n106\n00:05:57.611 --> 00:06:01.912\nhave different levels of\nsubscriptions in your Office 365.\n\n107\n00:06:01.912 --> 00:06:04.522\nSo if you're not on\nan Enterprise license and\n\n108\n00:06:04.522 --> 00:06:08.727\nyou're on a Home license there could\nbe some slight variations, okay?\n\n109\n00:06:08.727 --> 00:06:10.229\nThat's just the nature of these products.\n\n110\n00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:15.394\nSo again I might be covering something\nthat you might not even have access to and\n\n111\n00:06:15.394 --> 00:06:18.067\nit could be the version of your product.\n\n112\n00:06:18.067 --> 00:06:22.291\nAnother thing, always consult the Oracle,\nsearching for answers.\n\n113\n00:06:22.291 --> 00:06:26.961\nThere is so many different facets to these\nprograms that we can't cover every single\n\n114\n00:06:26.961 --> 00:06:31.580\ndetail in this episodes, we'll try but\nthere is always something more out there.\n\n115\n00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.764\nAnd so consulting Google or Bing or\nany search engine that you prefer to use,\n\n116\n00:06:36.764 --> 00:06:41.143\nit will always go ahead and\nhelp to just kind of find the answers.\n\n117\n00:06:41.143 --> 00:06:45.290\nThink sometimes how you can say\nwhat you are wanting to do,\n\n118\n00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.006\nthat's sometimes the hardest part.\n\n119\n00:06:48.006 --> 00:06:51.744\nSo try to just try keep searching out\nthere and see what you can find and\n\n120\n00:06:51.744 --> 00:06:56.215\neverybody uses Excel differently just like\nI have said in the graphical element.\n\n121\n00:06:56.215 --> 00:06:58.981\nNow is this a program that\nyou want to go ahead and\n\n122\n00:06:58.981 --> 00:07:01.345\nmake invitation to a birthday party in?\n\n123\n00:07:01.345 --> 00:07:02.380\nWell, you could,\n\n124\n00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.405\nthere's nothing that says you can't\nuse Excel to create an invitation.\n\n125\n00:07:06.405 --> 00:07:10.787\nBut maybe some other products like Word,\nthat's where you might want to do that.\n\n126\n00:07:10.787 --> 00:07:14.428\nBut again, everybody has a different\nreason for using these products.\n\n127\n00:07:14.428 --> 00:07:17.092\nMaybe all you do is sort and\nfilter data, so\n\n128\n00:07:17.092 --> 00:07:21.014\nthat's gonna be an area that\nyou're really going to focus on.\n\n129\n00:07:21.014 --> 00:07:23.737\nOr maybe you really wanna use\na conditional formatting, or\n\n130\n00:07:23.737 --> 00:07:26.308\nyou might not have any use for\nconditional formatting.\n\n131\n00:07:26.308 --> 00:07:30.223\nBut just knowing that the product can do\nit, you never know down the road when\n\n132\n00:07:30.223 --> 00:07:34.219\nyou're going to be able to use some of\nthese things, and say, you know what?\n\n133\n00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:36.445\nI know that Excel can do that,\nand then you can come back and\n\n134\n00:07:36.445 --> 00:07:37.364\nwatch these episodes.\n\n135\n00:07:37.364 --> 00:07:40.508\nAnd of course always have fun,\nI try to have fun,\n\n136\n00:07:40.508 --> 00:07:43.654\nI always try to keep it light and\nentertaining and\n\n137\n00:07:43.654 --> 00:07:48.505\nhopefully to be able to make you using\nExcel be a little bit more enjoyable.\n\n138\n00:07:48.505 --> 00:07:52.271\nI know it can get really frustrating from\ntime to time when it's not working the way\n\n139\n00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:52.882\nyou want to.\n\n140\n00:07:52.882 --> 00:07:56.893\nBut sometimes it's kinda let's see\nif I can make everything pink and\n\n141\n00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:59.184\nit will make everything a lot more fun.\n\n142\n00:07:59.184 --> 00:08:02.296\nSo I hope you enjoyed these episodes and\nI hope to see you really soon.\n\n143\n00:08:02.296 --> 00:08:09.309\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
