00:00:12.122\nMy name is Vonne Smith, and\nin this course overview,\n\n4\n00:00:12.122 --> 00:00:14.960\nwell we're gonna be talking about\nwhat is this show all about?\n\n5\n00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.832\nWho is our target audience?\n\n6\n00:00:16.832 --> 00:00:19.505\nDo we need to know anything\nbefore we get started?\n\n7\n00:00:19.505 --> 00:00:22.191\nAnd any extra tidbits I might have for\nyou.\n\n8\n00:00:22.191 --> 00:00:24.226\nSo, what are we gonna talk about?\n\n9\n00:00:24.226 --> 00:00:27.795\nThis show is broken up\ninto four specific areas.\n\n10\n00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:31.923\nWe have analyze data, graphical elements,\ncollaborate and security, and\n\n11\n00:00:31.923 --> 00:00:33.073\nadditional topics.\n\n12\n00:00:33.073 --> 00:00:38.221\nIn the Analyze Data section we're going\nto be covering things like sorting and\n\n13\n00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:39.869\nfiltering out our data.\n\n14\n00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:43.374\nWe're also gonna be formatting in tables,\none of my favorite subjects.\n\n15\n00:00:43.374 --> 00:00:46.384\nWe'll also explore\nthe world of outlining and\n\n16\n00:00:46.384 --> 00:00:49.325\ncreating subtotals within our worksheets.\n\n17\n00:00:49.325 --> 00:00:54.602\nWe'll also be applying conditional\nformatting, formatting that goes ahead and\n\n18\n00:00:54.602 --> 00:00:58.892\napplies to specific criteria that\nyou instill and you make a rule.\n\n19\n00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:02.700\nVery powerful stuff and a lot of different\nthings that you can use to kinda\n\n20\n00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.267\njust see what is that\ninformation saying to you.\n\n21\n00:01:05.267 --> 00:01:07.933\nHow are we going to be analyzing our data.\n\n22\n00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.184\nGraphical elements,\n\n23\n00:01:09.184 --> 00:01:13.603\nwell that's where we get into some of my\nother favorite areas of adding images.\n\n24\n00:01:13.603 --> 00:01:15.982\nWe'll be adding in\nwonderful pictures of Mr.\n\n25\n00:01:15.982 --> 00:01:19.890\nFuego and Bishop, the stars of our\nshow at Christmas Cats, Incorporated.\n\n26\n00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.481\nWe'll also be adding in\nsome different shapes and\n\n27\n00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:24.772\nhow to format that will fills and\noutlines.\n\n28\n00:01:24.772 --> 00:01:27.079\nWe'll also add in SmartArt.\n\n29\n00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:27.892\nWhat is that?\n\n30\n00:01:27.892 --> 00:01:29.067\nIt's art that's smart.\n\n31\n00:01:29.067 --> 00:01:34.448\nReally, it is and it's a lot of fun and\nreally easy to use, in Excel.\n\n32\n00:01:34.448 --> 00:01:37.693\nSo, we'll be exploring those\ndifferent elements that you might\n\n33\n00:01:37.693 --> 00:01:41.006\nwant to add in to your workbooks,\njust add a little bit of pizzazz.\n\n34\n00:01:41.006 --> 00:01:45.723\nNow, is Excel the place where you're gonna\nbe doing an extensive amount of formatting\n\n35\n00:01:45.723 --> 00:01:47.088\nof graphical elements?\n\n36\n00:01:47.088 --> 00:01:50.958\nMaybe not, but everybody has different\nreasons for why they want to use Excel.\n\n37\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:55.672\nSo we will definitely be covering\nthat area within this series.\n\n38\n00:01:55.672 --> 00:01:59.247\nWe'll also be talking about\nhow to share workbooks, and\n\n39\n00:01:59.247 --> 00:02:03.428\nhow to track changes in that,\nCollaborate and Security section.\n\n40\n00:02:03.428 --> 00:02:07.266\nWe'll also go over an important\ntopic called Data Validation.\n\n41\n00:02:07.266 --> 00:02:12.219\nMaking sure that people are inputting\nin the information into your cells that\n\n42\n00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:13.368\nyou want them to.\n\n43\n00:02:13.368 --> 00:02:17.365\nAnd if they're not, let's go ahead and\nthrow them that little warning error to\n\n44\n00:02:17.365 --> 00:02:19.873\ntry to make sure that you\nvalidate the information\n\n45\n00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:23.770\nthat's going into that with some certain\nrules and locking some areas down.\n\n46\n00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.585\nSpeaking of locking down areas,\nwe're going to explore the world of\n\n47\n00:02:27.585 --> 00:02:31.741\nlocking cells and being able to protect\nour worksheets and our workbooks.\n\n48\n00:02:31.741 --> 00:02:35.537\nAnd then we'll also explore how\nto pass protect our files and\n\n49\n00:02:35.537 --> 00:02:39.335\nthen also get into the document\nproperties that includes how\n\n50\n00:02:39.335 --> 00:02:42.398\nto add those different properties or\nmetadata.\n\n51\n00:02:42.398 --> 00:02:46.636\nAlso inspect our document for hidden\ninformation and how to get rid of that.\n\n52\n00:02:46.636 --> 00:02:50.103\nAnd also explore the world\nof accessibility and\n\n53\n00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:55.485\nmaking sure that our files are accessable\nfor people with disabilities.\n\n54\n00:02:55.485 --> 00:02:56.930\nWe also have our additional topics area.\n\n55\n00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.271\nSo we were gonna just throw in some little\ntidbits like customizing our environments,\n\n56\n00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:04.185\nsome macros and some other\nthings that we will hopefully be\n\n57\n00:03:04.185 --> 00:03:07.395\nusing as an error to throw things\nin there, just as important but\n\n58\n00:03:07.395 --> 00:03:09.487\nmaybe not fall in to a specific category.\n\n59\n00:03:09.487 --> 00:03:12.371\nAnd we'll be hopefully\nbuilding that as we go.\n\n60\n00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:14.510\nSo who is this for?\n\n61\n00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.130\nAll Office users.\n\n62\n00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.069\nNow as you see, Office is with a capital\nO, and that's not meaning that you have\n\n63\n00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.831\nto be in a physical office\nlocation in a large organization,\n\n64\n00:03:24.831 --> 00:03:26.701\nit can be in your home office.\n\n65\n00:03:26.701 --> 00:03:31.451\nReally, it's Office as the products,\nthe Office Suite,\n\n66\n00:03:31.451 --> 00:03:37.158\nto where you are using Excel as part\nof the collection of applications.\n\n67\n00:03:37.158 --> 00:03:39.599\nMaybe you're using Word and\nOutlook on the same way.\n\n68\n00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.574\nSo anybody that wants to go ahead and\nexplore the world of Excel,\n\n69\n00:03:43.574 --> 00:03:46.381\nit is a little bit higher\nof a functionality.\n\n70\n00:03:46.381 --> 00:03:50.432\nAnd that's why I put intermediate\nusers to advanced users.\n\n71\n00:03:50.432 --> 00:03:55.337\nSo where these series does work\nupon the Excel Essentials series,\n\n72\n00:03:55.337 --> 00:03:58.060\nso we will be referring back to that.\n\n73\n00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.219\nSo if you haven't watch some of\nthe episodes on that particular show,\n\n74\n00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:03.906\nyou might wanna gonna go ahead and\nrefresh your knowledge.\n\n75\n00:04:03.906 --> 00:04:08.989\nBut this is also used as a stand-alone\nseries, where is you have some of\n\n76\n00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:14.516\nthat foundational knowledge, then\nyou'll be able to excel in this series.\n\n77\n00:04:14.516 --> 00:04:17.035\nAnd talking about that in a Prerequisites,\n\n78\n00:04:17.035 --> 00:04:21.198\nright there we were talking about\nthe foundational knowledge of Excel.\n\n79\n00:04:21.198 --> 00:04:24.401\nAnd then also having\na familiarity with other Office\n\n80\n00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:26.451\nproducts can always be helpful.\n\n81\n00:04:26.451 --> 00:04:31.025\nIf you know how to insert images in Word\nwell then you know how to insert images\n\n82\n00:04:31.025 --> 00:04:31.814\ninto Excel.\n\n83\n00:04:31.814 --> 00:04:36.251\nA lot of that same functionality goes\nacross all of your different applications.\n\n84\n00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:40.490\nFor example the episode that we talked\nabout documents and properties,\n\n85\n00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.102\nit's pretty much the same thing\nas in the Word or PowerPoint or\n\n86\n00:04:44.102 --> 00:04:48.429\nany of those other series that you may\nhave watch that exact same episode.\n\n87\n00:04:48.429 --> 00:04:50.428\nWell it's the same thing in Excel.\n\n88\n00:04:50.428 --> 00:04:54.324\nSo having a little bit of that knowledge\nand other places will be helpful.\n\n89\n00:04:54.324 --> 00:04:59.076\nAnd of course just knowing about how work\nwithin your Windows operating system\n\n90\n00:04:59.076 --> 00:05:02.905\nis always a good thing to know about for\nthese different shows.\n\n91\n00:05:02.905 --> 00:05:06.763\nSo some little tidbits\nthat I can give to you.\n\n92\n00:05:06.763 --> 00:05:10.420\nThere is always more than one\nway to do something in Excel.\n\n93\n00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.876\nI might cover ways one, two and three.\n\n94\n00:05:12.876 --> 00:05:16.181\nBut maybe there's a fourth and\na fifth way, that I didn't cover.\n\n95\n00:05:16.181 --> 00:05:19.877\nWell, there's a lot of information to\ncover just kinda getting the basics\n\n96\n00:05:19.877 --> 00:05:20.413\non there.\n\n97\n00:05:20.413 --> 00:05:25.420\nSo it is very possible that there is\nsome other way to do it and that's okay.\n\n98\n00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.174\nSo, and updates will happen,\n\n99\n00:05:27.174 --> 00:05:31.424\nmaybe I'm showing you something in\nthese episodes that you're like hmm,\n\n100\n00:05:31.424 --> 00:05:35.892\nI don't have that button or like maybe\nmy button looks a little bit different.\n\n101\n00:05:35.892 --> 00:05:43.214\nThat happens to your products, because\nI am using an Office 365 subscription.\n\n102\n00:05:43.214 --> 00:05:47.647\nIf you're not on a subscription base,\nthat's where things might look a little\n\n103\n00:05:47.647 --> 00:05:52.213\ndifferent there, because there are certain\nelements that are only available for\n\n104\n00:05:52.213 --> 00:05:53.884\nOffice 365 subscribers.\n\n105\n00:05:53.884 --> 00:05:57.611\nJust one other note on that\nparticular subject is that we\n\n106\n00:05:57.611 --> 00:06:01.912\nhave different levels of\nsubscriptions in your Office 365.\n\n107\n00:06:01.912 --> 00:06:04.522\nSo if you're not on\nan Enterprise license and\n\n108\n00:06:04.522 --> 00:06:08.727\nyou're on a Home license there could\nbe some slight variations, okay?\n\n109\n00:06:08.727 --> 00:06:10.229\nThat's just the nature of these products.\n\n110\n00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:15.394\nSo again I might be covering something\nthat you might not even have access to and\n\n111\n00:06:15.394 --> 00:06:18.067\nit could be the version of your product.\n\n112\n00:06:18.067 --> 00:06:22.291\nAnother thing, always consult the Oracle,\nsearching for answers.\n\n113\n00:06:22.291 --> 00:06:26.961\nThere is so many different facets to these\nprograms that we can't cover every single\n\n114\n00:06:26.961 --> 00:06:31.580\ndetail in this episodes, we'll try but\nthere is always something more out there.\n\n115\n00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.764\nAnd so consulting Google or Bing or\nany search engine that you prefer to use,\n\n116\n00:06:36.764 --> 00:06:41.143\nit will always go ahead and\nhelp to just kind of find the answers.\n\n117\n00:06:41.143 --> 00:06:45.290\nThink sometimes how you can say\nwhat you are wanting to do,\n\n118\n00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.006\nthat's sometimes the hardest part.\n\n119\n00:06:48.006 --> 00:06:51.744\nSo try to just try keep searching out\nthere and see what you can find and\n\n120\n00:06:51.744 --> 00:06:56.215\neverybody uses Excel differently just like\nI have said in the graphical element.\n\n121\n00:06:56.215 --> 00:06:58.981\nNow is this a program that\nyou want to go ahead and\n\n122\n00:06:58.981 --> 00:07:01.345\nmake invitation to a birthday party in?\n\n123\n00:07:01.345 --> 00:07:02.380\nWell, you could,\n\n124\n00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.405\nthere's nothing that says you can't\nuse Excel to create an invitation.\n\n125\n00:07:06.405 --> 00:07:10.787\nBut maybe some other products like Word,\nthat's where you might want to do that.\n\n126\n00:07:10.787 --> 00:07:14.428\nBut again, everybody has a different\nreason for using these products.\n\n127\n00:07:14.428 --> 00:07:17.092\nMaybe all you do is sort and\nfilter data, so\n\n128\n00:07:17.092 --> 00:07:21.014\nthat's gonna be an area that\nyou're really going to focus on.\n\n129\n00:07:21.014 --> 00:07:23.737\nOr maybe you really wanna use\na conditional formatting, or\n\n130\n00:07:23.737 --> 00:07:26.308\nyou might not have any use for\nconditional formatting.\n\n131\n00:07:26.308 --> 00:07:30.223\nBut just knowing that the product can do\nit, you never know down the road when\n\n132\n00:07:30.223 --> 00:07:34.219\nyou're going to be able to use some of\nthese things, and say, you know what?\n\n133\n00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:36.445\nI know that Excel can do that,\nand then you can come back and\n\n134\n00:07:36.445 --> 00:07:37.364\nwatch these episodes.\n\n135\n00:07:37.364 --> 00:07:40.508\nAnd of course always have fun,\nI try to have fun,\n\n136\n00:07:40.508 --> 00:07:43.654\nI always try to keep it light and\nentertaining and\n\n137\n00:07:43.654 --> 00:07:48.505\nhopefully to be able to make you using\nExcel be a little bit more enjoyable.\n\n138\n00:07:48.505 --> 00:07:52.271\nI know it can get really frustrating from\ntime to time when it's not working the way\n\n139\n00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:52.882\nyou want to.\n\n140\n00:07:52.882 --> 00:07:56.893\nBut sometimes it's kinda let's see\nif I can make everything pink and\n\n141\n00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:59.184\nit will make everything a lot more fun.\n\n142\n00:07:59.184 --> 00:08:02.296\nSo I hope you enjoyed these episodes and\nI hope to see you really soon.\n\n143\n00:08:02.296 --> 00:08:09.309\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.047\n[SOUND] All right, greetings everyone,\n\n2\n00:00:08.047 --> 00:00:10.619\nand welcome back to another\ngreat episode of OfficePro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:13.597\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:13.597 --> 00:00:18.014\nwell actually we are kicking off our first\nin our series for Excel, Advanced Excel.\n\n5\n00:00:18.014 --> 00:00:20.804\n2016 Advanced,\nlet me make sure you understand that for\n\n6\n00:00:20.804 --> 00:00:22.560\nthose of you keeping score out there.\n\n7\n00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.060\nAnd joining us in the studio to lend\nher expertise on that, to help us\n\n8\n00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.380\nbe more enlightened when it comes to\nExcel, our good friend Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.550\nVonne welcome to the show and\nhow are you today?\n\n10\n00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.350\n&gt;&gt; I'm so wonderful.\n\n11\n00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.270\nI'm ready to excel you\ninto the world of Excel.\n\n12\n00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.320\nHa.\n&gt;&gt; I see what you did there, funny.\n\n13\n00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.330\n&gt;&gt; I try, I try.\n\n14\n00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.740\nSo, but yes,\nwe are starting a new series here and\n\n15\n00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.080\nwe are going to start off with\nthe topic of analyzing data.\n\n16\n00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.615\nBecause isn't that what we all want\nto do in Excel we go ahead and\n\n17\n00:00:51.615 --> 00:00:52.885\ninput all of this information.\n\n18\n00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:57.015\nAnd then we have to actually see\nwhat is the data telling us.\n\n19\n00:00:57.015 --> 00:01:02.955\nAnd sometimes we have all that raw data we\nneed to be able to organize it in a way\n\n20\n00:01:02.955 --> 00:01:08.800\nthat makes sends to us, and so, enters\nin the concept of sorting and filtering.\n\n21\n00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.460\nSo, when you sort something Daniel,\nwhat do you think about that?\n\n22\n00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.040\n&gt;&gt; I think about putting it in some\nsort of categorical order, right?\n\n23\n00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.700\nI've got these things, widgets, and I've\ngot doohickeys and gizmos, and I'm going\n\n24\n00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.440\nto put them all in a doohickeys bucket and\nthe gizmos bucket and the thingamajigs.\n\n25\n00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.250\n&gt;&gt; That is the most amazing\nexplanation I've ever heard.\n\n26\n00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.070\n&gt;&gt; And I said that because I knew Vonne\nwould know exactly what I'm talking about.\n\n27\n00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.230\n&gt;&gt; I was just thinking more\nof like alphabetizing.\n\n28\n00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.835\nI didn't even go into the whozie\nwhatzie and everything so.\n\n29\n00:01:39.835 --> 00:01:41.980\n[LAUGH] But yes, that's exactly right.\n\n30\n00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.830\nIf I need to organize it in\nthis way of what makes sense.\n\n31\n00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.090\nPut all the whatchamagigs in\none bucket and put those, and\n\n32\n00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.790\nput that bucket before that bucket,\nand so on and so forth.\n\n33\n00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.760\n&gt;&gt; Then maybe alphabetize the buckets,\nright?\n\n34\n00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.852\nGet really good at sorting.\n\n35\n00:01:55.852 --> 00:01:57.930\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, and we can go ahead and\n\n36\n00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.080\ncolor code them,\ncuz you know I love to color code things.\n\n37\n00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.675\n&gt;&gt; That could be like a day\nwithout sunshine, wouldn't it?\n\n38\n00:02:02.675 --> 00:02:03.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right?\n\n39\n00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.076\nGotta put everything in,\nsome pinks and some-\n\n40\n00:02:05.076 --> 00:02:05.913\n&gt;&gt; Darn right we do.\n\n41\n00:02:05.913 --> 00:02:07.240\n&gt;&gt; Yellows and blues.\n\n42\n00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.505\nJust rainbow it up.\n\n43\n00:02:08.505 --> 00:02:11.985\n[LAUGH] So\nwe're gonna go ahead and do that.\n\n44\n00:02:11.985 --> 00:02:14.100\nSorting is exactly just that.\n\n45\n00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.140\nWe're going to change the order of it.\n\n46\n00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.660\nBut, we're not removing\nany of the information.\n\n47\n00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.020\nAll the information's still there.\n\n48\n00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.480\nWe just want to change the order,\nfiltering.\n\n49\n00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.470\nFiltering's going to be one where that's\nwhere I only want to see just this.\n\n50\n00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.740\nOkay, so now I have everything, some pinks\nand yellows and blues, but I don't want to\n\n51\n00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.960\nsee the pink and the blue, I just want\nto see the yellow, that kind of things.\n\n52\n00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.980\nOr you can say,\nyou have everything in departments and\n\n53\n00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.860\nyou only want to see everything\nin the advertising department,\n\n54\n00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.790\nnot the human resources because\nyou need to be able to kind of\n\n55\n00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.450\ndrill down into that information\nto be able to pull that stuff out.\n\n56\n00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.990\nSo that's what we're going to be doing,\n\n57\n00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.770\nso why don't we jump on down into\nour trusty computer right here.\n\n58\n00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.550\nStill working on JT's computer\nwith our nice, wonderful desktop.\n\n59\n00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.570\nI'm sure y'all have gotten used to this.\n\n60\n00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.420\nSo I have a file called sort and filter.\n\n61\n00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.490\nWe will open this up.\n\n62\n00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:12.780\nGot a couple worksheets in here, and\nI've purposefully formatted this\n\n63\n00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.610\ninformation to be able to show you all\nthe different ways that we can do this.\n\n64\n00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.910\nWe've got some colors going on in here.\n\n65\n00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.770\nWe have our same addresses that\nwe've seen in our Christmas Cats\n\n66\n00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.630\nexample from our first series, if we\nhaven't watched the essential series.\n\n67\n00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.880\nGo back and watch some of those episodes.\n\n68\n00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.410\nThey're quite fun.\n\n69\n00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.410\nAnd we're going to be sorting\nin this particular worksheet, so\n\n70\n00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:34.550\nthat's what we've got.\n\n71\n00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.640\nNow, notice in this one I do have some\ncolumn headings in here like the first,\n\n72\n00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.930\nlast, apartment.\n\n73\n00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.990\nThose aren't required for you to do this\nparticular sort or any type of sorting But\n\n74\n00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.280\nit does make a little bit easier when\nwe get into our custom sorts and\n\n75\n00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.970\nwe start getting into our filters.\n\n76\n00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.930\nHaving headings can be really,\nreally helpful for\n\n77\n00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.680\nyou if you can go ahead and\nbe able to put those arm.\n\n78\n00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.940\nIf you can't, that's fine,\nwe still go with that.\n\n79\n00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.350\nAll right, so\nI have this list of information.\n\n80\n00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.390\nI've got them by like last name, first\nname, so if I wanted to put this into\n\n81\n00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:14.430\nalphabetical order, maybe by last name,\nor do I want to go by city.\n\n82\n00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.920\nSo you have to determine,\nwell, what is the criteria?\n\n83\n00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.290\nWhat is the column that I want\nto sort all this information by,\n\n84\n00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.650\nso you do have to determine that.\n\n85\n00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.370\nI have determined for this particular\nexample we will go with last name.\n\n86\n00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.780\nSo notice where I'm at.\n\n87\n00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.120\nAll I've done is I've clicked\nmy cursor into a cell.\n\n88\n00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.230\nI've selected a cell anywhere within\nthe column that I want to sort by.\n\n89\n00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.650\nThat's all you have to do.\n\n90\n00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.360\nOnce you go to there, on your home tab\n\n91\n00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.830\nover on the right hand side there\nis a button called sort and filter.\n\n92\n00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.200\nSo if you click that down, there it goes,\nsort a to z, or sort z to a.\n\n93\n00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.620\nDo you want it ascending or descending?\n\n94\n00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.100\nI'll pick A to Z, and then that's it.\n\n95\n00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.600\nThat's as easy as it is.\n\n96\n00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.160\n&gt;&gt; Pretty straightforward, Vonne.\n\n97\n00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.410\nI don't think it takes a Rocket\nscientist to figure this one out?\n\n98\n00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:06.990\n&gt;&gt; No, and-\n&gt;&gt; They don't make that kinda easy.\n\n99\n00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n100\n00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.520\nAnd they actually have made it a lot\neasier throughout the versions cuz\n\n101\n00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.320\nway back in the day.\n\n102\n00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.790\nAnd this is where people\nthey don't trust it.\n\n103\n00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.960\nThey're like well all you did was\nsort that one column didn't you?\n\n104\n00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:17.750\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n105\n00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.860\n&gt;&gt; Well, no it moved cuz let's undo and\nyou can see there's Mocha Cup, and\n\n106\n00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.820\nTootsie Paws, and\nBrandy Boy and Sasha Cat.\n\n107\n00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:32.940\nWhen I take this and I sort it well\nthen the mocha cup it all came with it.\n\n108\n00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:33.640\n&gt;&gt; It did.\n\n109\n00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.240\n&gt;&gt; It did cuz it's really\nlooking at by record if\n\n110\n00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.790\nwe're gonna use that database terminology.\n\n111\n00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:42.800\nIt's saying because this is\none contiguous range of data.\n\n112\n00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.720\nIt sees this all as one block.\n\n113\n00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.270\nSo it's saying all right well since you\nwere in this column, I'm going to sort\n\n114\n00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.910\nby this and move everything around\nwithin this range of cells,\n\n115\n00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:59.315\nwhich can be a little you know scary when\nyou are like I don't know if it did that.\n\n116\n00:05:59.315 --> 00:06:01.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I've also got this a lot from\n\n117\n00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.710\npeople who have been using Excel for\nmany many years because back in the day\n\n118\n00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:12.350\nyou had to make sure that select\nall of this before you sort it.\n\n119\n00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:17.720\nOtherwise it would only sort that one\nparticular column that you were in.\n\n120\n00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.464\nSo I can see where people might\nbe a little leery about it.\n\n121\n00:06:22.605 --> 00:06:26.885\nBut it's evolved, and it knows this\nis what we're doing, cuz it sees this\n\n122\n00:06:26.885 --> 00:06:30.445\nas a table of information, a database,\nhowever you wanna call it.\n\n123\n00:06:30.445 --> 00:06:32.505\n&gt;&gt; So if we were coming\nfrom an older version and\n\n124\n00:06:32.505 --> 00:06:35.005\nthat was making us a little\nbit gun-shy about no, no,\n\n125\n00:06:35.005 --> 00:06:39.545\nI've gotta go through three different\nsteps just to make one thing happen, and\n\n126\n00:06:39.545 --> 00:06:41.905\nthen I gotta go through three\nto make another thing happen.\n\n127\n00:06:41.905 --> 00:06:44.400\nIt said no we're a little smarter\nthan that, we figured that.\n\n128\n00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.880\nThis was difficult,\nwe're gonna make it easy.\n\n129\n00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.720\n&gt;&gt; Correct, and you'd have to go back\npretty far, I think 2000 or something,\n\n130\n00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.980\nit was a long-\n&gt;&gt; People are still using it.\n\n131\n00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.095\n&gt;&gt; That I-\n&gt;&gt; Still happening.\n\n132\n00:06:53.095 --> 00:06:54.450\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I hear you.\n\n133\n00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:58.990\nThere's so many people using Windows XP,\nit's like, really?\n\n134\n00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.605\n&gt;&gt; Yes, ma'am.\n[LAUGH]\n\n135\n00:06:59.605 --> 00:07:00.113\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n136\n00:07:00.113 --> 00:07:01.251\n[LAUGH] Go ahead and get that-\n\n137\n00:07:01.251 --> 00:07:02.791\n&gt;&gt; Well, just, they get locked in, they\n\n138\n00:07:02.791 --> 00:07:06.081\nget frozen with fear about moving to some\n&gt;&gt; Something that they don't know\n\n139\n00:07:06.081 --> 00:07:07.881\nbecause it might be too difficult for\nthem to relearn.\n\n140\n00:07:07.881 --> 00:07:09.180\nThey don't want to relearn something\n\n141\n00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.280\nthat they feel they already know so.\n\n142\n00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.700\n&gt;&gt; And\nof course when you talk about networks.\n\n143\n00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:16.420\nHow they can't upgrade because of\nwhatever software they decided to write.\n\n144\n00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It only runs on Windows XP, and\n\n145\n00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:20.013\nit's like, well have fun with\nthose security breaches.\n\n146\n00:07:20.013 --> 00:07:22.570\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna be a great time.\n\n147\n00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.385\nSomeone's getting fired.\n\n148\n00:07:24.385 --> 00:07:25.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\n\n149\n00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.300\nthat's really as easy as it is.\n\n150\n00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.660\nI say, all right, go ahead and\nput it in and sort it.\n\n151\n00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:35.380\nIf I wanted to sort by color, click in the\ncolumn by team color, click sort A to Z.\n\n152\n00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:39.700\nAnd there you go blue, green,\nred, and yellow, awesome.\n\n153\n00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:43.397\nNow if you did make a selection,\nlike if I selected say,\n\n154\n00:07:43.397 --> 00:07:47.348\njust this amount of text, and\nI went to try to do this again.\n\n155\n00:07:47.348 --> 00:07:52.129\nNow whether it's this one section or\nthis one column, and I said sort A to Z,\n\n156\n00:07:52.129 --> 00:07:56.838\nnotice I like that it gives you this\nwarning, hey well I found that there's\n\n157\n00:07:56.838 --> 00:08:02.271\ndata next to it, so If, since you have not\nselected this data, it will not be sorted.\n\n158\n00:08:02.271 --> 00:08:04.690\nDo you want to expand the selection?\n\n159\n00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:06.800\nMeaning, I see everything around it,\n\n160\n00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:12.810\nbecause if you want me to just sort this\none section, well then the developer,\n\n161\n00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:17.490\nI'll, you know associated with Brandy Boy,\nand developer from Fuego Cat.\n\n162\n00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:19.730\nWell then its not gonna match up anything.\n\n163\n00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:20.570\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna jumble.\n\n164\n00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:21.230\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\n\n165\n00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.730\nthen the data is, it's not correct.\n\n166\n00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:26.570\nSo that's where,\nI like that they're giving you a warning,\n\n167\n00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:29.320\nto say, I don't know if you\nreally want to do that.\n\n168\n00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.480\nNow I'm sure there's some example\nof why you would want to say, no,\n\n169\n00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.800\ngo ahead and\ncontinue with this current selection.\n\n170\n00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would guess if you weren't\nusing it, kind of like what you said,\n\n171\n00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:40.990\nyou made that database\nreference of more like a table.\n\n172\n00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:44.970\nHaving that rows, and that type of\ndata where everything is connected.\n\n173\n00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:48.352\nIf they were just different sets that\nwere adjacent to each other, yeah,\n\n174\n00:08:48.352 --> 00:08:50.169\nyou might be able to get away with that.\n\n175\n00:08:50.169 --> 00:08:50.873\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n176\n00:08:50.873 --> 00:08:55.870\nAnd that's why I was trying to get\na scenario off the top of my head.\n\n177\n00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:58.850\nThe way you just described it was perfect.\n\n178\n00:08:58.850 --> 00:08:59.530\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n179\n00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.960\nThere are reasons why\nyou'd want to do that.\n\n180\n00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:06.300\nThat's a nice thing to let us know that,\nall right, that's what we've got.\n\n181\n00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.180\nPerfect.\nThose single level sorts,\n\n182\n00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:13.196\nI'm only sorting by a team color because\nif I, I wanna sort by team color,\n\n183\n00:09:13.196 --> 00:09:16.020\nand then by department.\n\n184\n00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:21.480\nOr maybe, department then by last name,\nbecause you might have,\n\n185\n00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.630\nif you have 600,000 Records,\nthere's a lot of Smiths.\n\n186\n00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:31.150\nSo, its gonna be sort by last name,\nthen first name, then by-\n\n187\n00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:33.890\n&gt;&gt; You thought Jones' were bad, right?\n\n188\n00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:38.490\n&gt;&gt; We're in that group of like,\npeople ask, what's your name?\n\n189\n00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:40.250\nVon.\nWhat's your last name?\n\n190\n00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:41.000\nSmith, no, really.\n\n191\n00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.960\nReally uncommon first, very common\nlast name, so I get a lot of jokes.\n\n192\n00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.805\nDon't get a lot of Lowries.\n\n193\n00:09:47.805 --> 00:09:50.113\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, no, all I think is season salt.\n\n194\n00:09:50.113 --> 00:09:54.407\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I laugh, Lawry's seasoned salt,\n\n195\n00:09:54.407 --> 00:09:56.115\ncuz I love that stuff.\n\n196\n00:09:56.115 --> 00:09:58.020\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It was pretty good.\n\n197\n00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:58.703\nThat's my people.\n\n198\n00:09:58.703 --> 00:09:59.775\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Nice.\n\n199\n00:09:59.775 --> 00:10:00.508\nGive me discounts.\n\n200\n00:10:00.508 --> 00:10:01.390\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n201\n00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:02.230\n&gt;&gt; All right, awesome.\n\n202\n00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:05.100\nSo those are the different\nways that you can go ahead and\n\n203\n00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:09.270\ndo a single level of a sort, but again I\njust mentioned that multiple level sort.\n\n204\n00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:12.020\nThis is where you get\ninto the custom sort.\n\n205\n00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:16.370\nSo all you have to do is click your\ncursor somewhere within your range\n\n206\n00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:17.160\nof information.\n\n207\n00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.190\nSo, we come over here\nto our Sort &amp; Filter.\n\n208\n00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:24.306\nWe come over to custom shorts,\nnot shorts, sorts.\n\n209\n00:10:24.306 --> 00:10:26.750\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You can buy custom shorts online or\n\n210\n00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:27.765\nat a boutique.\n\n211\n00:10:27.765 --> 00:10:28.818\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You could yes,\n\n212\n00:10:28.818 --> 00:10:32.290\n[LAUGH] some very fancy ones with pink\nflamingos on them and everything, so.\n\n213\n00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:34.365\n&gt;&gt; Nice hibiscus right\non the front of the leg.\n\n214\n00:10:34.365 --> 00:10:35.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I like that.\n\n215\n00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:37.870\nYou know I would buy those.\n\n216\n00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:43.410\nSo we have sort by, and this is where\nyou can determine, what do I want to do?\n\n217\n00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:48.403\nAnd since I do have column headings that\nI can say, first, last, department, so\n\n218\n00:10:48.403 --> 00:10:52.320\nif I wanted to sort by last name and\nsort by values.\n\n219\n00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:56.340\nAnd notice it has cell color,\nfont color, cell icon,\n\n220\n00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:59.700\nbecause it is realizing that,\nthat is text.\n\n221\n00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:04.500\nIf I had gone to zip, you can notice\nthat it's still doing it, but\n\n222\n00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.840\nit's going from smallest to largest.\n\n223\n00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:11.860\nInstead of if I go with that text in\nthere, and then that it goes A to Z, so\n\n224\n00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:18.700\nit does recognize like, your data, and\nwhether or not it's like numbers or texts.\n\n225\n00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.820\nBut we will go with last name,\n\n226\n00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:24.030\nwe will sort on the values\nlike what's in the cell.\n\n227\n00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:26.800\nAnd we'll do an ascending order of A to Z.\n\n228\n00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:29.470\nLet's add another level.\n\n229\n00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:34.960\nWe say, alright we'll sort by last name,\nthen sort by department.\n\n230\n00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.780\nSounds good, and we'll do the same A to Z,\nand let's just see what that looks like.\n\n231\n00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:40.280\nWe'll click okay, and there we go.\n\n232\n00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:44.620\nNow, notice I do have a couple right\nin here, that I did this on purpose for\n\n233\n00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:48.925\nthis example, like we have Fuego,\nSasha, Simba and well, Sasha again.\n\n234\n00:11:48.925 --> 00:11:52.570\n[LAUGH] To where they have, by last name.\n\n235\n00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:58.760\nThere all last name of cat, and then you\ncan see developer, and then sales and\n\n236\n00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:03.050\nv is before s, and so that's why we\nhave it sorted by that particular order.\n\n237\n00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:04.450\nNow I didn't have a lot of information,\n\n238\n00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:06.960\ncause I wanted to just be able\nto demonstrate these topics, but\n\n239\n00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:13.570\nyou can imagine like I said 10,000 Smiths,\nthen you can go ahead and go from there.\n\n240\n00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.150\nSo using that custom sort,\n\n241\n00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:19.000\nchanging the sort by, and\nwhat order can be really good.\n\n242\n00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.200\nAnd it also, of course,\ngoes by your headings on that.\n\n243\n00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.550\nThere was one that I wanted\nto let you know about.\n\n244\n00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:28.420\nI'm gonna come over here\nto our Custom Sort again.\n\n245\n00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:33.310\nAnd notice, it does keep everything\nthat I had from last time.\n\n246\n00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:36.390\nWell, I don't really wanna\nsort by last name anymore.\n\n247\n00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:40.620\nI wanna go ahead and\njust select that row, if you wanna say.\n\n248\n00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:44.990\nThat level, and delete that level.\n\n249\n00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:47.150\nAnd so I'm left with department.\n\n250\n00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:50.300\nI did wanna just come into,\nwhere you have your options button.\n\n251\n00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:53.830\nBecause with those options,\nthere is this part for k sensitive,\n\n252\n00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:56.670\nand that could be one or the other.\n\n253\n00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.810\nNow, if I have k sensitive checked on,\nwhich is by default, click OK,\n\n254\n00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:00.720\nlet me just show you.\n\n255\n00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:05.590\nThat it does the lowercase first,\nand then the uppercase.\n\n256\n00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.970\nIf we had turned that around,\nlet me go back into that custom sort, and\n\n257\n00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:09.900\nturn it from Z to A.\n\n258\n00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:14.980\nYou can see that the lower case\nsales is at the bottom, and\n\n259\n00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:17.690\nthe upper case sales is at the top.\n\n260\n00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:20.420\nSo some of those criterias you can change,\nso\n\n261\n00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:24.250\nthere's not really much more besides that,\nbecause you do want to, of course,\n\n262\n00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:28.380\nsort by rows and not by columns, cuz\nthat's what we want to go ahead and do.\n\n263\n00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:32.390\nAnd so\nthat's what we've got with our sorting.\n\n264\n00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:37.150\nThere are some options of sorting by\ncolor, okay, so here we have some-\n\n265\n00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.083\n&gt;&gt; I mean aren't you thrilled?\n\n266\n00:13:39.083 --> 00:13:40.100\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I am.\n\n267\n00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.320\n&gt;&gt; We knew Vonne was gonna\nbuy this product one day.\n\n268\n00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I just love the color coder-\n&gt;&gt; It is fun.\n\n269\n00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.880\n&gt;&gt; I do have like sticky notes and\neverything.\n\n270\n00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.970\n&gt;&gt; You don't even want to see my notebook,\ncuz I color code all sorts of stuff,\n\n271\n00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:53.570\nbecause it just makes it easier for\nme to visually reference things,\n\n272\n00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:56.330\nand at a glance, I can go,\nyeah, I know what that is.\n\n273\n00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:57.810\nSo I like color coding as well.\n\n274\n00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:00.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and your blue highlighter\nmeans something different\n\n275\n00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:02.280\nthan the yellow highlighter,\nso on and so forth.\n\n276\n00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.860\nSo I'm a huge into that.\n\n277\n00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:10.810\nSo we have this here, and I have went\nthrough and just randomly assigned colors,\n\n278\n00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:16.690\nand then notice, I have text colors,\nand I have cell colors for our sorting.\n\n279\n00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:21.700\nSo if I click here in our first column,\nand now I go over here to custom,\n\n280\n00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:25.130\nor sorry, to sort and\nfilter, then to custom sort.\n\n281\n00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:28.210\nSo we wanna sort by,\nlet's go with the first name and\n\n282\n00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:32.500\nsort on the Font color then,\nokay, perfect.\n\n283\n00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:33.560\nWhat do I want them to go?\n\n284\n00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:36.380\nLet's go with output green on the top.\n\n285\n00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:37.470\nThat sounds perfect.\n\n286\n00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:38.940\nYou click OK.\n\n287\n00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:42.960\nIt did that, but then you're like,\nwhat about all the other colors?\n\n288\n00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.360\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't sort the rest of them?\n\n289\n00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.710\nSo you have to continually\nsort by each color?\n\n290\n00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:47.440\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n291\n00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.529\nYes.\nThat's where if I wanted to go like,\n\n292\n00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:54.260\ngreen, then yellow, then blue,\nthen what other color do I have?\n\n293\n00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:54.785\n&gt;&gt; Red?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, red.\n\n294\n00:14:54.785 --> 00:14:56.360\n[LAUGH] I'm like, what are the colors\n\n295\n00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:56.970\nI have in here?\n\n296\n00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:59.680\nThen I will kinda just\nhave to keep doing that.\n\n297\n00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.370\nYou come back into Custom Sort,\nand now go to, well, all right.\n\n298\n00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:05.960\nNow I wanna go by red is on top.\n\n299\n00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:12.180\nYou can start seeing how it will organize\nitself by just going back over and\n\n300\n00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:17.130\nover through our different colors, and now\nI've got it to where, if I do it one more\n\n301\n00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:20.650\ntime and go with the blue, I think\nthe blue is already at the bottom now.\n\n302\n00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:23.880\nBut now I've got it to where\nthey're all grouped together.\n\n303\n00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.529\nSo you will have to do it multiple times.\n\n304\n00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:31.060\nAnd that's just how it works with\nthe sorting so, just showing you some\n\n305\n00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:35.850\ndifferent options, cuz again you're color\ncoating things that mean something to you,\n\n306\n00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:39.220\nso you can go ahead and\nuse that in your custom sort.\n\n307\n00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:44.440\nAnd then do your multiple levels of\nyour sorting, first name by color,\n\n308\n00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:48.531\nthen by last name,\nthen by department, then by state.\n\n309\n00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:51.172\nAnd so on and so forth, cool.\n\n310\n00:15:51.172 --> 00:15:53.835\nSo sorting just goes ahead and\nreorganizes.\n\n311\n00:15:53.835 --> 00:15:56.311\nNow let's move on to filtering.\n\n312\n00:15:56.311 --> 00:15:57.319\nI do love a, you know what?\n\n313\n00:15:57.319 --> 00:15:59.351\nBefore I say that,\nI just realized, I looked down.\n\n314\n00:15:59.351 --> 00:16:01.880\nI'm like, wait,\nI forgot one little thing on sorting.\n\n315\n00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.770\n&gt;&gt; [FOREIGN]\n&gt;&gt; [FOREIGN] Come back\n\n316\n00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:07.480\nover here to the sort no heading.\n\n317\n00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.110\nBecause you can still do it.\n\n318\n00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:10.730\nCome over here and do a custom sort, and\n\n319\n00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:12.890\nit's still gonna move all\nthe records together.\n\n320\n00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:14.600\nSo that's nothing different.\n\n321\n00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:18.800\nThe only part I wanted to point out to you\nis, when you go into your custom sorts,\n\n322\n00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:22.780\nnotice it's not gonna have your\ncolumn headings in there but\n\n323\n00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:25.640\nit will have A, B, C, D.\n\n324\n00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.858\nAnd so that's why you might wanna just go\nahead and throw some headings in there,\n\n325\n00:16:29.858 --> 00:16:33.920\njust make a little easier for\nyourself when your organizing this data.\n\n326\n00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:38.370\nBut it will still do it, you're just\ngonna have column references instead of\n\n327\n00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:42.040\nwords that you would associate\nwith that ticket information, so.\n\n328\n00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:46.200\nAnd notice like right here, perhaps I\ndidn't point this out over there but\n\n329\n00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:51.060\nright there were it says that my data has\nheaders, it's smart enough to know, no,\n\n330\n00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:52.330\nthese aren't headers.\n\n331\n00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:55.820\nBecause there's nothing kind of\ndifferentiating it from the data which is\n\n332\n00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:56.890\nin the columns.\n\n333\n00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:00.030\nSo that's why it has that not checked on.\n\n334\n00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:05.330\nAs opposed to if I went back over here\nto our sort, went to our custom sort.\n\n335\n00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:09.310\nNotice it does notice yep, you're data\nhas headers so I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n336\n00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:14.260\npull that in the What to sort by\nin this drop-down list for you.\n\n337\n00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:18.580\nOkay, so now we'll move onto filters.\n\n338\n00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:22.330\nSo filters is really just a way of\nshowing and hiding information.\n\n339\n00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:25.280\nI only want to see\nthe people in advertising.\n\n340\n00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.360\nI only want to see now.\n\n341\n00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:30.140\nAnd this is where, if you're kind of-\nthink about if you have inventory.\n\n342\n00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:34.078\nWe have inventory within a company, and\nthere are lots of different levels.\n\n343\n00:17:34.078 --> 00:17:38.250\nYou have 500,000 parts and\nI want to say go ahead and\n\n344\n00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:43.250\nfind the parts in this particular store,\nor this particular region, and\n\n345\n00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:47.770\nthen by store, and then by part number.\n\n346\n00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:51.210\nSo you can kind of differentiate,\nyeah that's where that part is and\n\n347\n00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:52.920\nyou can tell your customer.\n\n348\n00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.050\nThis is where it's located.\n\n349\n00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:56.920\nSo you kind of just filter out,\n\n350\n00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.620\ndon't show me all the rest of it,\njust show me what I need.\n\n351\n00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:02.620\nNow, to put on filters,\n\n352\n00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:06.070\nyou can click anywhere within\nyour contiguous range of data.\n\n353\n00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:09.250\nYou come over to sort and filter,\nand you just click on filter.\n\n354\n00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:11.240\nAnd just watch row one for me.\n\n355\n00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:13.670\nWhen you watch row one and click filter.\n\n356\n00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:14.510\nWhat did it do?\n\n357\n00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:17.360\n&gt;&gt; It gave me a little drop down arrow.\n\n358\n00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I like.\n\n359\n00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:23.630\n&gt;&gt; It's just saying, all right well\nI have determined that I can filter\n\n360\n00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:27.390\nby this particular field or column.\n\n361\n00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:29.910\nSo if I drop this down by last, okay,\n\n362\n00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:32.980\ncool, you still have your sorts in\nthere so you can still do that.\n\n363\n00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:35.950\nOkay, let's store A to Z,\nnothing different there.\n\n364\n00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:40.400\nBut now here I only want to\nsee the people in advertising.\n\n365\n00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.970\nI'm gonna extend this\nout by the bottom right\n\n366\n00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:45.980\nhand corner it's like a two pointed\narrow you can set this out.\n\n367\n00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:49.070\nSo it's seeing everything in here,\nnotice that it has like\n\n368\n00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:53.930\nhuman resources with the lowercase sales,\nwith the lowercase which is fine.\n\n369\n00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:56.810\nIf I turn off select all, so\n\n370\n00:18:56.810 --> 00:19:00.430\nI'm saying don't have anything selected,\njust show me advertising.\n\n371\n00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:03.210\nCheck that check box on ,there you go.\n\n372\n00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:06.100\nNow I'm only showing\nthe advertising department.\n\n373\n00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:09.740\nAnd then from here,\nI could store it by team color.\n\n374\n00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:14.380\nAnd the biggest thing to start\nnoticing about this is right here.\n\n375\n00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:15.590\nDo you see these little icons?\n\n376\n00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:17.490\nYou see little like.\n\n377\n00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:18.630\n&gt;&gt; It looks like a funnel.\n\n378\n00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:20.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThey look like a cone to me,\n\n379\n00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:21.560\nlike a cone filter.\n\n380\n00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.900\nThat means, well, well,\nit's filtering [LAUGH].\n\n381\n00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:26.070\nSo we've got that.\n\n382\n00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:30.970\nAnd then this guy over here,\nthat indicates a sort.\n\n383\n00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:37.410\nSo I have sorted this ascending, going up,\nso we have blue, green, red, yellow.\n\n384\n00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:39.570\nSo you can see that you\ncan use these filters.\n\n385\n00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:40.660\nI love this part.\n\n386\n00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:42.810\nLike this it's just one of\nmy favorite things to do.\n\n387\n00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:43.950\nSo I was like all right perfect.\n\n388\n00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:48.720\nWell now I want to see advertising and\ndevelopers.\n\n389\n00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.360\nMaybe throw those in.\n\n390\n00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.400\nSo I can just keep on checking off or\n\n391\n00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.170\nno the different things\nthat I want to see by.\n\n392\n00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:59.020\nAnd then say well okay now I've\ngot developers and advertising.\n\n393\n00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:00.800\nAnd out of those developers and\n\n394\n00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.310\nadvertising people I want to\nsee who lives in Florida.\n\n395\n00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:07.030\nMaybe I'm trying to find a sales rep to go\nto a conference or something like that.\n\n396\n00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:11.000\nSo then you can come over here and say all\nright, well I only want you to show me,\n\n397\n00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.300\nI'm gonna turn off the select all,\nthe people in Florida.\n\n398\n00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:18.050\nWell who's on team read?\n\n399\n00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:21.140\nWell guess what Jack Bowtie,\nyou're gonna go to-\n\n400\n00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.010\n&gt;&gt; He just hit the lottery.\n\n401\n00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:23.270\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right so\n\n402\n00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:27.860\nyou can see how you can just\nkeep on drilling on on there.\n\n403\n00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:31.510\nAnd I could even go from, all right,\nthey have to be a developer or advertiser,\n\n404\n00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:34.520\nthey have to be in Florida, and\nthey have to be on team Red, and\n\n405\n00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:38.020\nthen they have to be in\nthe city of Gainesville.\n\n406\n00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:41.180\nOkay, if you have that many records,\nyou can keep on filtering down.\n\n407\n00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.930\nAnd I know the columns, or\n\n408\n00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:48.830\nthe fields, that they are being filtered\nby because of those little icons.\n\n409\n00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:51.690\nNow what if I, all right,\nwell let's open it up to where,\n\n410\n00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:55.540\nas long as they're in Florida, that\ndoesn't matter what department they're in.\n\n411\n00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:59.330\nSo keep the filter on the state,\ntake the filter off the department.\n\n412\n00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:02.370\nClick on this, click and\njust say, clear the department.\n\n413\n00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:05.260\nOkay, so now here are all\nthe people in Florida, but\n\n414\n00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:10.180\nI really only want to have the people\nfrom either team red or team blue.\n\n415\n00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:12.100\nSo turn off green.\n\n416\n00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:15.270\nTurn off yellow, click OK.\n\n417\n00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:16.750\nI think you get the idea here, right?\n\n418\n00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:20.490\nIt's just so much easier and\nnone of the information is gone.\n\n419\n00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:21.910\nNow how I know this it isn't gone.\n\n420\n00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:24.850\nDo you see over here,\nthis is a big indication for you.\n\n421\n00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:26.580\nWell one you have a little drop down.\n\n422\n00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:30.630\nBut do you see how the row\nreferences over here, they're blue?\n\n423\n00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:33.000\n&gt;&gt; It's showing the actual\nrow number as well.\n\n424\n00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and they're not in order.\n\n425\n00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:40.570\nYou see 2, 4, 6, 8, 16, 23, and you see\nthose kinda little lines in between them.\n\n426\n00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:42.270\n&gt;&gt; The hidden lines, right?\n\n427\n00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:47.120\n&gt;&gt; yeah, yeah, so this is indicating\nthe blue numbers are telling you\n\n428\n00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.740\n&gt;&gt; This information is being filtered.\n\n429\n00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:52.220\nThere's other stuff in here but\n\n430\n00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:57.400\nI'm not showing it because there is\na particular filter by state and\n\n431\n00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:01.520\nby team color, I believe that we have\napplied and so that's where we've got it.\n\n432\n00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:05.220\nGood indications of how you\nknow where your data is.\n\n433\n00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:09.570\nNothing's gone, you're just setting\ncriteria of what you want to see by.\n\n434\n00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:10.130\nVery, very cool.\n\n435\n00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:13.480\nNow if you have a lot of different\nfilters on here and think,\n\n436\n00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.310\njust want to clear everything.\n\n437\n00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:19.020\nAn easy way to do that is just\nback up on that Home tab,\n\n438\n00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:22.578\ncoming over to Sort &amp; Filter and\njust clearing them out.\n\n439\n00:22:22.578 --> 00:22:25.660\nJust take everything out,\nand all sorts, too.\n\n440\n00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:28.710\nSo, if I click on Clear, everything's\nback to the way it started and\n\n441\n00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:32.390\nI can kinda start over from scratch,\nand that's really nice.\n\n442\n00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:33.820\nAnd even if you had it,\n\n443\n00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:37.440\nlet's throw on a couple filters\nreally quickly, just for fun.\n\n444\n00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.490\nHold on, wait, there we go.\n\n445\n00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:42.600\nGet a couple more cuz there's\nnot too many people in there.\n\n446\n00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:43.370\nAll right, so\n\n447\n00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:46.680\nyou can have lots of different\nfilters If you take off the filters.\n\n448\n00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:47.530\nIt just like, you know what?\n\n449\n00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:48.780\nDon't even put the filters on there.\n\n450\n00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:50.520\nStop doing all of it.\n\n451\n00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:54.020\nIt's not going to just leave\nit the way it is when you just\n\n452\n00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:57.670\nsee how it's like kind of got a box\non it that indicates that this is on.\n\n453\n00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:00.660\nIf I turn it off, everything comes back.\n\n454\n00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:02.190\nSo, don't think like, I turned it off.\n\n455\n00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:04.860\nI'm not gonna remove.\n\n456\n00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:08.570\nNothing is removed,\nthis is only a visual type of-\n\n457\n00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:09.980\n&gt;&gt; It's like putting a mask or\n\n458\n00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:14.400\nsomething in front of the data so that you\nonly see what exactly it is you wanna see.\n\n459\n00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.760\nAnd then when you wanna clear it,\nyou're just taking the mask away and\n\n460\n00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.670\nthere's all the regular\ndata just waiting for you.\n\n461\n00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:20.510\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\nthat reminds me of Photoshop, too.\n\n462\n00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:22.545\nI know you use Photoshop\ntoo a little bit too.\n\n463\n00:23:22.545 --> 00:23:26.110\n[LAUGH] So it's like a mask, it's just\nhiding, it's not removing pixels.\n\n464\n00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:27.090\nIt's just hiding them,\n\n465\n00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:32.250\nthey're all still there, same information,\ninstead of pixels we have just data.\n\n466\n00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:33.885\nYay, data, pixels,\nit's all the same thing, right?\n\n467\n00:23:33.885 --> 00:23:35.059\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, technically yes.\n\n468\n00:23:35.059 --> 00:23:36.280\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, pretty much.\n\n469\n00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:40.460\nSo a few other things that I wanted\nto show you in these filters.\n\n470\n00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:43.836\nAnd let's go ahead and put them back on,\nso we'll turn back on the filter,\n\n471\n00:23:43.836 --> 00:23:45.078\nlittle drop downs on here.\n\n472\n00:23:45.078 --> 00:23:48.023\nYou can filter by color.\n\n473\n00:23:48.023 --> 00:23:53.067\nWe were sorting by color,\nnow we can filter To say, hey,\n\n474\n00:23:53.067 --> 00:23:58.114\nhere in my first name,\nI'd only like to see the red team or\n\n475\n00:23:58.114 --> 00:24:01.811\nthe people for the text color that is red.\n\n476\n00:24:01.811 --> 00:24:05.924\nSo if I say, yep, let's take out the font\ncolor, and there you go, there's red.\n\n477\n00:24:05.924 --> 00:24:08.995\nNow the only thing with this color stuff,\n\n478\n00:24:08.995 --> 00:24:12.780\nwhether it is your field color or\nyour text colors.\n\n479\n00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:16.098\nSo let's come back over here to\nDepartment, notice that we have,\n\n480\n00:24:16.098 --> 00:24:17.354\nit is seeing the colors.\n\n481\n00:24:17.354 --> 00:24:22.690\nYou can't do like, I wanna see reds and\nblues, like it formatted that way.\n\n482\n00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:26.508\nYou can only filter by\na single color in this way.\n\n483\n00:24:26.508 --> 00:24:30.653\nAnd I've looked this up, and\nof course, the solution was, well,\n\n484\n00:24:30.653 --> 00:24:32.999\nyou can with VBA, with visual based.\n\n485\n00:24:32.999 --> 00:24:34.661\nIf you can go into the code, I mean,\nyou could pretty much do anything.\n\n486\n00:24:34.661 --> 00:24:38.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're taking control at\nthe base level at that point in time.\n\n487\n00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:41.399\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so they're like, yeah, and they\nhave this big old block, and I'm like no.\n\n488\n00:24:41.399 --> 00:24:45.264\n[LAUGH] That's enough, I'll just go\nahead and just turn a filter off,\n\n489\n00:24:45.264 --> 00:24:46.600\nturn it back on.\n\n490\n00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:49.828\nAnd then if you wanted to, I mean,\nyou could always come back out here again.\n\n491\n00:24:49.828 --> 00:24:57.330\nIf I filter by red, I could select all\nthis information, and I can copy it.\n\n492\n00:24:57.330 --> 00:25:01.180\nAnd I can bring it into a new worksheet.\n\n493\n00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:03.928\nAnd then I could just go\nwith paste the values, so\n\n494\n00:25:03.928 --> 00:25:05.816\nI can bring the information out.\n\n495\n00:25:05.816 --> 00:25:09.770\nI mean, there's things you can do with\nthe information once you've filtered it,\n\n496\n00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:12.950\nsuch as copy it into another sheet,\nand then do whatever you need.\n\n497\n00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:17.470\nSo if I say, here's the reds, and then\ncome back in here, let's escape to cancel\n\n498\n00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:23.460\nthat copy, clear out the filter, and then\nsay, now go ahead and filter by blues.\n\n499\n00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:27.350\nGo ahead and select that information,\ncopy, paste it, and so on and so forth.\n\n500\n00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:30.712\nSo that's where a lot of people,\nwell then, what do I do with it?\n\n501\n00:25:30.712 --> 00:25:35.518\nWell, it's up to you, [LAUGH] if it's\njust a view thing or so on and so forth.\n\n502\n00:25:35.518 --> 00:25:38.158\nNow when we get into one of\nmy other favorite things,\n\n503\n00:25:38.158 --> 00:25:41.760\nthere's a lot of favorite things that\nI have here in Excel, but [LAUGH].\n\n504\n00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:42.654\n&gt;&gt; I feel a song coming on.\n\n505\n00:25:42.654 --> 00:25:44.469\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n506\n00:25:44.469 --> 00:25:45.053\n&gt;&gt; Show tunes.\n\n507\n00:25:45.053 --> 00:25:49.470\n&gt;&gt; Yes, with whiskers on kittens and\nsnowflakes that stay on my nose and\n\n508\n00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:50.316\neyelashes.\n\n509\n00:25:50.316 --> 00:25:51.874\n&gt;&gt; Yes, here we go.\n\n510\n00:25:51.874 --> 00:25:54.013\n&gt;&gt; Okay, [LAUGH] sorry, [LAUGH] stop.\n\n511\n00:25:54.013 --> 00:25:57.573\n[LAUGH] What were we talking about?\n\n512\n00:25:57.573 --> 00:25:58.995\n[LAUGH] I totally got lost.\n\n513\n00:25:58.995 --> 00:26:01.061\n&gt;&gt; Some filters.\n\n514\n00:26:01.061 --> 00:26:04.599\n&gt;&gt; Right, filters, yes,\nand about colors, and yes,\n\n515\n00:26:04.599 --> 00:26:07.364\n[LAUGH] I totally got\noff track on that one.\n\n516\n00:26:07.364 --> 00:26:08.218\n&gt;&gt; It's okay, we'll keep moving.\n\n517\n00:26:08.218 --> 00:26:12.202\n&gt;&gt; That's okay, well, we're gonna go ahead\nand just get the information out and\n\n518\n00:26:12.202 --> 00:26:14.533\nkeep on filtering, my favorite things.\n\n519\n00:26:14.533 --> 00:26:15.512\n&gt;&gt; Your favorite things.\n&gt;&gt; There we go, I'm like,\n\n520\n00:26:15.512 --> 00:26:16.418\nit will come back around, keep talking.\n\n521\n00:26:16.418 --> 00:26:19.697\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\njust keep on turning the grinder.\n\n522\n00:26:19.697 --> 00:26:21.385\nYou'll eventually get there sooner or\nlater, right?\n\n523\n00:26:21.385 --> 00:26:24.686\n&gt;&gt; My favorite things, tables,\nthat's what I was going to.\n\n524\n00:26:24.686 --> 00:26:28.996\nOne of my other favorite episodes is\nthe tables episode, where you go ahead and\n\n525\n00:26:28.996 --> 00:26:30.050\ndo the same thing.\n\n526\n00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:32.320\nYou can do your filters, but\nthen you can perform calculations and\n\n527\n00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:32.960\neverything into it.\n\n528\n00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:33.650\n&gt;&gt; That's cool.\n\n529\n00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:34.690\n&gt;&gt; Yes, check it out.\n\n530\n00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:37.427\nIt's in this series, so\nyou'll be seeing it very, very shortly.\n\n531\n00:26:37.427 --> 00:26:40.577\nAll right, so back to here, a few more\nthings on our custom filters, and\n\n532\n00:26:40.577 --> 00:26:42.480\nthen we'll go ahead and wrap this up.\n\n533\n00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.540\nLet's clear this filter right here.\n\n534\n00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:48.970\nWe are going to do,\ntext and number filters.\n\n535\n00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:53.110\nWe're doing our colors, well,\nnow here, if I wanted to, and\n\n536\n00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:56.565\nthis is where it can get\nreally nitty gritty into it.\n\n537\n00:26:56.565 --> 00:27:03.409\nIn the text filters, what if I wanted\nto begin with, like all right,\n\n538\n00:27:03.409 --> 00:27:08.390\neverything that begins with A-V, for ad-\n&gt;&gt; Averse.\n\n539\n00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:09.460\n&gt;&gt; Adverse.\n\n540\n00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:10.667\n&gt;&gt; Not adverse, averse.\n\n541\n00:27:10.667 --> 00:27:14.396\n&gt;&gt; Averse, yes, okay,\nwe'll go with F-L for Florida.\n\n542\n00:27:14.396 --> 00:27:15.076\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n543\n00:27:15.076 --> 00:27:16.841\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you can see,\n\n544\n00:27:16.841 --> 00:27:18.908\nwhat does it begin with?\n\n545\n00:27:18.908 --> 00:27:22.548\nI can say F-L, and I'm not sure,\ndo we have anything with F-L?\n\n546\n00:27:22.548 --> 00:27:25.597\nNo, okay, no, not in the first names,\nbut [LAUGH] in the cities,\n\n547\n00:27:25.597 --> 00:27:26.545\nwe would be able to.\n\n548\n00:27:26.545 --> 00:27:30.745\nBut you can see that you have different\ncriterias of how this could be,\n\n549\n00:27:30.745 --> 00:27:32.375\nlike what does it equal?\n\n550\n00:27:32.375 --> 00:27:37.445\nOkay, so if I wanted to equal Fuego,\nnow this is where you have your option\n\n551\n00:27:37.445 --> 00:27:42.310\nof all right,\nnow if I said equals Fuego and\n\n552\n00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:45.880\nSasha, now that's where it can't be both.\n\n553\n00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:49.050\nSo this was like,\nwhat's the difference between and and or?\n\n554\n00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:50.210\nLet's go with or.\n\n555\n00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:55.643\nSo it can either be Fuego,\nor it can equal Sasha.\n\n556\n00:27:55.643 --> 00:27:58.351\nAnd then we'll go with Sasha and click OK.\n\n557\n00:27:58.351 --> 00:28:02.445\nAnd notice that there you go,\nI have determined that these are the two\n\n558\n00:28:02.445 --> 00:28:05.410\ncriterias that I want\nthe text to be filtered by.\n\n559\n00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:07.960\nSo there's some really\npowerful things that you\n\n560\n00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:11.020\ncould do with these custom text filters.\n\n561\n00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.650\nOr if you go into a column with numbers,\n\n562\n00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:16.640\nthen you can go into\na column view number format.\n\n563\n00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.700\nSo let's come over here to zip.\n\n564\n00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:22.838\nNow these are zip codes, so\nthis might not totally equate real life of\n\n565\n00:28:22.838 --> 00:28:27.986\nlike,I only wanna see any zip\ncode that is greater than 2,000.\n\n566\n00:28:27.986 --> 00:28:30.830\nThink about this as sales or\nanything like that.\n\n567\n00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:34.887\nSo I can come up to here,\ngo into number filters, and\n\n568\n00:28:34.887 --> 00:28:39.883\nlet's say greater than or\nequal to 2,000, and I click OK.\n\n569\n00:28:39.883 --> 00:28:41.740\nAnd well, there's quite a few.\n\n570\n00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:42.720\nWell, there we go.\n\n571\n00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.693\nWell, that didn't work right there.\n\n572\n00:28:44.693 --> 00:28:45.311\nAll right, well, let's try this again.\n\n573\n00:28:45.311 --> 00:28:46.970\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; One more time.\n\n574\n00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:50.170\n&gt;&gt; We will clear that out and we will\ndo this, we will say number filters.\n\n575\n00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:52.489\nWe'll do less than, how about that?\n\n576\n00:28:52.489 --> 00:28:55.795\nLess than 2,000.\n\n577\n00:28:55.795 --> 00:28:57.355\nYou know what, I think I, one, two.\n\n578\n00:28:57.355 --> 00:28:57.906\n&gt;&gt; 20,000.\n\n579\n00:28:57.906 --> 00:28:58.841\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n580\n00:28:58.841 --> 00:28:59.577\n&gt;&gt; Because there's five.\n\n581\n00:28:59.577 --> 00:29:01.913\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nall of them are greater than 2,000.\n\n582\n00:29:01.913 --> 00:29:02.474\n&gt;&gt; Of course.\n\n583\n00:29:02.474 --> 00:29:03.042\n&gt;&gt; There's a problem.\n\n584\n00:29:03.042 --> 00:29:05.581\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You gotta know how many\n\n585\n00:29:05.581 --> 00:29:06.430\nplaceholders you have.\n\n586\n00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:07.482\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n587\n00:29:07.482 --> 00:29:08.082\n&gt;&gt; Stinking math.\n\n588\n00:29:08.082 --> 00:29:09.409\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n589\n00:29:09.409 --> 00:29:10.994\n&gt;&gt; And I'm trying to do number stuff and\n\n590\n00:29:10.994 --> 00:29:13.820\nsales on zip codes, so\nthat's where I'm getting all messed up.\n\n591\n00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:15.824\n&gt;&gt; You're really in your\nwheelhouse right now, Vonne.\n\n592\n00:29:15.824 --> 00:29:17.560\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, this is totally in my Bollywood.\n\n593\n00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:18.592\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n594\n00:29:18.592 --> 00:29:19.856\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So where do we go?\n\n595\n00:29:19.856 --> 00:29:24.292\nThere we go, now you can see that\nI have 20,000 in our zip code.\n\n596\n00:29:24.292 --> 00:29:25.716\nThat's where we get our references.\n\n597\n00:29:25.716 --> 00:29:30.579\nSo again, really great to be able to\nput our criterias on those numbers,\n\n598\n00:29:30.579 --> 00:29:34.165\ncuz we do track a lot of numbers in Excel.\n\n599\n00:29:34.165 --> 00:29:37.672\nAnd then you can, of course,\ncome back in here and just say all right,\n\n600\n00:29:37.672 --> 00:29:39.225\nwhat if I want it greater than?\n\n601\n00:29:39.225 --> 00:29:41.550\nThese are kinda fun, like the top ten.\n\n602\n00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:43.940\nOkay, so I wanna take the top ten items.\n\n603\n00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:45.920\nAll right, so you want your top\nten performers in there, or\n\n604\n00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.520\nyour lowest performers.\n\n605\n00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:50.821\nYou can also do a lot of like,\nis it between,\n\n606\n00:29:50.821 --> 00:29:56.467\nmaybe I only wanna see ranges\n20,000 to 40,000 in this range.\n\n607\n00:29:56.467 --> 00:30:01.404\nOr greater than or equal to, so there's\na lot of different things that you can do\n\n608\n00:30:01.404 --> 00:30:05.771\nwith customizing those particular\ntext filters and number filters.\n\n609\n00:30:05.771 --> 00:30:09.814\nSo you can see whichever way you spin it,\nwhichever way you put it through\n\n610\n00:30:09.814 --> 00:30:12.810\nthe filter, it will come out\nto the way you want it to.\n\n611\n00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:14.718\nJust keep on clicking\nthose drop arrows and\n\n612\n00:30:14.718 --> 00:30:16.740\nknow how many placeholders\nyou need to have.\n\n613\n00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:17.713\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It will help.\n\n614\n00:30:17.713 --> 00:30:20.451\n&gt;&gt; And don't get lost on singing-\n&gt;&gt; Show tunes.\n\n615\n00:30:20.451 --> 00:30:22.952\n&gt;&gt; Show tunes, [LAUGH] and you'll be fine.\n\n616\n00:30:22.952 --> 00:30:25.010\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne, well,\n\n617\n00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:27.680\nit has been a lot of fun in this episode,\nthat's for sure.\n\n618\n00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.200\nSorting and filtering, obviously,\n\n619\n00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:34.248\nthey're very related type of things that\nyou can do, abilities inside of Excel.\n\n620\n00:30:34.248 --> 00:30:36.370\nBut you gotta know the difference\nbetween the two and\n\n621\n00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:39.700\nwhen one is appropriate versus the other\nor maybe both, you never know.\n\n622\n00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:43.370\nNow you know how to at least get your\nfeet wet with filtering and sorting.\n\n623\n00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:45.200\nSo go play with it, have a good time and\n\n624\n00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.447\nreally solidify that\nknowledge in your mind.\n\n625\n00:30:47.447 --> 00:30:50.330\nThat being said, it looks like\nwe're out of time for this episode.\n\n626\n00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:52.700\nVonne, I had a great time with you,\nthanks for joining us.\n\n627\n00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:55.490\nThank you,\nour lovely audience out there watching us.\n\n628\n00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:56.960\nWe do appreciate you joining us as well.\n\n629\n00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:00.100\nSigning off for Office Pro.TV,\nI've been host, Daniel

It's advanced but you know what\nadvanced, expert, close enough.\n\n9\n00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.375\n&gt;&gt; You can hear the lovely voice of\nmy coworker here, Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n10\n00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:32.825\nVonne, welcome to the show and\nthanks for help, clear that up.\n\n11\n00:00:32.825 --> 00:00:33.910\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.\n\n12\n00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.755\nYes, I mean, this is the advance day.\n\n13\n00:00:35.755 --> 00:00:36.715\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Now in Word,\n\n14\n00:00:36.715 --> 00:00:37.790\nwe did the-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n15\n00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.040\n&gt;&gt; Essentials, advance and experts.\n\n16\n00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.630\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; In this particular series,\n\n17\n00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.380\nwe're just doing essentials and\nadvanced and then.\n\n18\n00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We're just gonna,\n\n19\n00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.570\nwe're gonna call it quits.\n\n20\n00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.306\nWho knows we might throw\nan expert show in there one day.\n\n21\n00:00:49.306 --> 00:00:53.760\n[LAUGH] Just [INAUDIBLE] cuz\nthere is a lot to do in Excel.\n\n22\n00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n23\n00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.710\nsince we decided to break\nit up into functions and\n\n24\n00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.340\nnon functions this is non function\njust organizing the data series.\n\n25\n00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.580\nSo that's where I felt like I think\nwe just have enough to do essentials\n\n26\n00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.630\nand advanced.\n\n27\n00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.880\n&gt;&gt; Well I will stick with\nadvanced from now on.\n\n28\n00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.925\nJust to make sure, just in case.\n\n29\n00:01:10.925 --> 00:01:12.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, and who knows?\n\n30\n00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.900\nBy the time you're watching this,\n\n31\n00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.651\nthere might be something in the course\nlibrary that does say Excel expert, so.\n\n32\n00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:19.041\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It might be ultra expert by that time.\n\n33\n00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:20.511\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, probably not.\n\n34\n00:01:20.511 --> 00:01:23.080\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We could go really far with this\n\n35\n00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.640\nprogram, so.\n\n36\n00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.400\n&gt;&gt; It is a little complex.\n\n37\n00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.260\nIt has a lot of power behind\nit underneath the hood there.\n\n38\n00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.780\nBut we're going to dive into\nthe normal tapped power\n\n39\n00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.540\nthat people are probably going to work\nwith on a more day to day basis, correct?\n\n40\n00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.691\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, we're gonna be covering\nconditional formatting in this episode.\n\n41\n00:01:40.691 --> 00:01:41.546\n&gt;&gt; Those are big words.\n\n42\n00:01:41.546 --> 00:01:44.138\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It does, it sounds very\ndaunting, it's like gosh, what is that?\n\n43\n00:01:44.138 --> 00:01:46.522\nBut once I show you what it does,\nit's like that's really easy!\n\n44\n00:01:46.522 --> 00:01:49.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is another one of those.\n\n45\n00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.550\nIt is pretty simple if you just kind\nof throw it on there and just say so\n\n46\n00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.930\nwhat does this do?\n\n47\n00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.870\nSo when we talk about formatting our\nworksheets, we're talking about changing\n\n48\n00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.140\nthe font or the size, or the color,\nor the fill color, or the borders.\n\n49\n00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.620\nOr something to go ahead and\n\n50\n00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.480\nchange the look of the particular\ninformation in that cell.\n\n51\n00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.230\nWhen you're talking about\nconditional formatting you're\n\n52\n00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.280\nsaying you're going to format\nbased on a particular criteria.\n\n53\n00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.500\nOkay, cool so maybe for example,\nin this worksheet that I have right here.\n\n54\n00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.980\nWhy don't we go ahead and\njump on in here, conditional formatting.\n\n55\n00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.180\nWell I would like to basically\nbe able to see really quickly,\n\n56\n00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:40.220\nshow me every city that is Stewart,\nor Tampa, or Jacksonville.\n\n57\n00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.450\nGo ahead and format it and format it\nin a specific way that I can see it.\n\n58\n00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.420\nIt's more of a visual change\nof this is what I want to see\n\n59\n00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.640\nIn this format and\nyou can change it how you want to.\n\n60\n00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.320\nI think the easiest way to do it\nis really just to show you and\n\n61\n00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.370\nthat's where you could be like okay I can\nsee how I can work with this in my life.\n\n62\n00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.000\nAll right so less talk about where is\nit in our environment, it's on our\n\n63\n00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.260\nhome tab on a ribbon and it's right there\nwhere it says conditional formatting.\n\n64\n00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.430\nEasily spot trends and\npatterns in your data using bars, colors,\n\n65\n00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.650\nand icons to visually\nhighlight important values.\n\n66\n00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.895\nWell, I should just go ahead and do\nthe tool tips and just read it from there.\n\n67\n00:03:18.895 --> 00:03:20.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, it gives you so\nmuch information.\n\n68\n00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.382\nIt's like wow,\nI had a show built within the show.\n\n69\n00:03:23.382 --> 00:03:25.377\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like-\n&gt;&gt; Microsoft did it.\n\n70\n00:03:25.377 --> 00:03:27.149\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like I couldn't\nsay that better myself, and\n\n71\n00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:28.101\nactually that's way better.\n\n72\n00:03:28.101 --> 00:03:31.997\n&gt;&gt; They always say if you can't\ncome up with something original,\n\n73\n00:03:31.997 --> 00:03:34.605\nsteal from someone that was really good.\n\n74\n00:03:34.605 --> 00:03:36.944\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Something is the best form of flattery,\n\n75\n00:03:36.944 --> 00:03:37.452\nimitation.\n\n76\n00:03:37.452 --> 00:03:38.091\n&gt;&gt; Imitation.\n\n77\n00:03:38.091 --> 00:03:40.196\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so\nimitation is the best form of flattery-\n\n78\n00:03:40.196 --> 00:03:40.970\n&gt;&gt; Well what's plagiarism then?\n\n79\n00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.380\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Quote your sources.\n\n80\n00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.680\n&gt;&gt; That's Illegal.\n\n81\n00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.140\n&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you, Microsoft.\n\n82\n00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.694\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There we go, so\n\n83\n00:03:47.694 --> 00:03:49.545\nlet's go ahead and choose that.\n\n84\n00:03:49.545 --> 00:03:52.520\nNow notice you have a couple of\ndifferent things that you can do.\n\n85\n00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.190\nSo highlight cell rules.\n\n86\n00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.080\nSo there's a need to be a rule here\nthat [INAUDIBLE] values greater than,\n\n87\n00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.670\nless than, between, equal.\n\n88\n00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.130\nWe saw a lot of these\nthings in the filters.\n\n89\n00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.060\nNow notice that I have filters\non this particular worksheet.\n\n90\n00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.760\nAnd that's not required to\nhave the conditional format.\n\n91\n00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.450\nThat was just left over from the sort and\nfilter episode, when I had copied and\n\n92\n00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.418\npasted or did a couple changes to\nthis computer file to do this, so\n\n93\n00:04:20.418 --> 00:04:22.021\nthey're not connected.\n\n94\n00:04:22.021 --> 00:04:26.544\nThey don't have to be the same, but we\ndid see some of those things in the text\n\n95\n00:04:26.544 --> 00:04:30.520\nfilters and the number filters\nwhen we were doing these filters.\n\n96\n00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.380\nBut the filters just was\ntaking everything else out,\n\n97\n00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.030\nthis one is format based\non that condition.\n\n98\n00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.370\nSo the first thing you do need to\nknow about is you will need to select\n\n99\n00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.620\nthe range or\ninformation that you need to evaluate.\n\n100\n00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.800\nAs before when we were doing that sorting\nit's just like click anywhere and\n\n101\n00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.220\njust go ahead and do it.\n\n102\n00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.040\nSo if I wanted to see here in column b,\nso I have to select.\n\n103\n00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.800\nI'll say all of column b I would\nlike to conditionally format\n\n104\n00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.050\nthat I would like to have highlight\ncells with a particular rule.\n\n105\n00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.340\nLet's go with equal to, and\nif I click equal to, I'm going to type in\n\n106\n00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.030\nthe word cat, and you can see\nautomatically, it's just doing what?\n\n107\n00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:18.290\nIt is filling in with a light\nred fill with dark red text.\n\n108\n00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.600\nAnd they have some other\npre-determine ones in here and\n\n109\n00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.010\nmaybe I wanted it to be\ngreen instead of red.\n\n110\n00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.720\nI click OK, I zoom out and\nthen there you go.\n\n111\n00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.900\nI can just go ahead and see visually\nall the green are equal to cat,\n\n112\n00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.139\nall right, cool,\nthat's conditional formatting.\n\n113\n00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:38.224\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n114\n00:05:38.224 --> 00:05:42.365\n&gt;&gt; Now we can do everything with our text\nand we can have our equals, betweens and\n\n115\n00:05:42.365 --> 00:05:46.694\nI was like, look, date occurring, so if\nyou have this on say, you had a sales and\n\n116\n00:05:46.694 --> 00:05:50.264\nyou were tracking like everything\nbefore the middle of the month or\n\n117\n00:05:50.264 --> 00:05:52.250\nafter the middle of the month.\n\n118\n00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.050\n&gt;&gt; Those types of things.\n\n119\n00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.340\nYou can see all the different ways.\n\n120\n00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.660\nWhat about Duplicate Values?\n\n121\n00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.930\nNow, I know right here,\nthat cat is going to be there, but\n\n122\n00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.700\nlet's go with the anything that\nis duplicate fill in with yellow.\n\n123\n00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.760\nAnd notice that there's a couple of them.\n\n124\n00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.790\nThere's paws, cats, flowers, and\nthis is another thing, I'm like,\n\n125\n00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.170\nwell, why didn't I just go ahead and\nsort this?\n\n126\n00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.850\nIt's just different ones.\n\n127\n00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.600\nMaybe you can't sort this information.\n\n128\n00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.690\nMaybe there's something that is\npreventing you from ever sorting.\n\n129\n00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.780\nOr you've got it sorted in one way,\n\n130\n00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.090\nbut you can't kind of do what you\nneed to see by sorting it again.\n\n131\n00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.560\nSo why don't you just throw on some\nconditional formatting in that column,\n\n132\n00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.000\nseparate from the other, and\nthen you can be able to see it.\n\n133\n00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.830\nSo different ways that we can use that,\ncool, now if I click off of it,\n\n134\n00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.030\nnotice that this is just gonna\ngo ahead and keep on going.\n\n135\n00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:42.260\nAnd since I had this on all of column B,\nlet's say I went down to here and\n\n136\n00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:47.210\nI typed in Daniel and\nyou're Daniel Cat [LAUGH].\n\n137\n00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.890\nSee, but automatically look what it did,\nit did that formatting.\n\n138\n00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:51.640\n&gt;&gt; It highlighted it, yeah.\n\n139\n00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:56.980\n&gt;&gt; Because that was the rule, that was\nthe conditional formatting that I set.\n\n140\n00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.900\nIt met that conditional criteria,\nit went ahead and did that.\n\n141\n00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.750\n&gt;&gt; So the rule stays on\nuntil you remove it somehow?\n\n142\n00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.311\n&gt;&gt; Correct, so if I did mike dog,\n\n143\n00:07:06.311 --> 00:07:11.820\nnotice, that didn't work cuz it did\nnot meet that particular criteria.\n\n144\n00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.450\nSo that's where you can think about,\n\n145\n00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:16.170\nit will continue going because\nI did select all the column B.\n\n146\n00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.570\nIf you'd only select that one range,\nthen all the other cells that you hadn't\n\n147\n00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.170\nselected aren't going\nto have that criteria.\n\n148\n00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:26.310\nBut the point of, well,\nit's gonna stay on until I clear it, okay.\n\n149\n00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.570\nSo if I wanted to clear this, there's\na couple different options you can do.\n\n150\n00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:32.440\nI'm just gonna select,\nit doesn't even have to be the same one,\n\n151\n00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.730\nlike the thing that I have\nconditionally formatted.\n\n152\n00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.980\nIf I come over here to\nthe conditional format.\n\n153\n00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.710\nNotice down towards the bottom there is\nclear rules cuz that's what I'm doing,\n\n154\n00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:42.850\nI'm setting rules.\n\n155\n00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:46.087\nDo I wanna clear for the selected cells or\n\n156\n00:07:46.087 --> 00:07:49.430\ndo I wanna just get rid\nof the whole sheet?\n\n157\n00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:54.360\nSo in this sense I do so go ahead and\nclear it and then it goes away.\n\n158\n00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.960\nYour data isn't touched,\nall you're doing is formatting.\n\n159\n00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:04.638\nCool fun stuff so let's come over here\nto a couple other examples in our city.\n\n160\n00:08:04.638 --> 00:08:09.010\nAre we doing city no,\nwe're gonna do state, sorry.\n\n161\n00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:09.700\nI have all my notes\n&gt;&gt; No\n\n162\n00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.500\n&gt;&gt; Like which columns we're going through.\n\n163\n00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.950\nIn our state, I wanna say\neverything that is equal to MA.\n\n164\n00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:17.380\nGo ahead and format that a certain way.\n\n165\n00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:21.060\nSo I come up to conditional formating,\nI'll do my highlight rules, and\n\n166\n00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:22.820\nI'll do the equal to.\n\n167\n00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.530\nAnd I will say, MA.\n\n168\n00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:27.370\nNow, you can type it in manually.\n\n169\n00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:32.000\nOr, notice that your flashing cursor right\nhere is you can select a cell reference\n\n170\n00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.630\nto say, every cell that looks like this.\n\n171\n00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:39.270\nSo, for example, if I click on This\nparticular cell, yes that's perfect.\n\n172\n00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:45.040\nEqual to this cell reference of G9 with\nthe dollar sign for the absolute value.\n\n173\n00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:49.830\nAnd fill it in with we'll\ngo with a yellow for fun.\n\n174\n00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:53.810\nYay, then you're like there's\nan MA right there then your like\n\n175\n00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:55.760\nwhy didn't that change?\n\n176\n00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.910\nThere are a few little things that\nyou should always worry about,\n\n177\n00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:00.370\nespecially when you're\ninputting information.\n\n178\n00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:01.200\nWhy is that different?\n\n179\n00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.350\nNow let me click in here and\ndouble click into MA.\n\n180\n00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.200\nLet me zoom in so you can see this.\n\n181\n00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.770\nIf I use my cursor over to the right,\nsee how far over I go?\n\n182\n00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:11.480\nIt's stops after the A.\n\n183\n00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.380\nDouble click in here, there's a space.\n\n184\n00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:17.530\n&gt;&gt; So there's a whitespace\ncharacter that you can't see\n\n185\n00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.020\n&gt;&gt; But the computer knows it's there, so\n\n186\n00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:23.220\nit's saying, well hey that's not what you\ntold me to look for, and it skips it.\n\n187\n00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:27.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you gotta be really careful\nabout your data when you're inputting it.\n\n188\n00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:32.730\nDon't leave in those extra spaces,\ncuz you think it's not there.\n\n189\n00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:33.380\nIt is, and\n\n190\n00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.910\nit can you throw you off in certain\nthings that Excel is wanting to do.\n\n191\n00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:42.615\nCuz if you give it a criteria, it met\nthe criteria, this one does not, okay?\n\n192\n00:09:42.615 --> 00:09:44.405\nSo if I-\n&gt;&gt; And that's a good tip for\n\n193\n00:09:44.405 --> 00:09:48.810\neven later on as we get into formulas and\nthings because those white spaces matter.\n\n194\n00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:50.640\nI've done it in programming,\nyou're looking and looking,\n\n195\n00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.790\nthis code looks perfect,\nwhy is it not running?\n\n196\n00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:54.930\nAnd what you can't see is there's\na white space somewhere and\n\n197\n00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:56.219\nit's causing everything to break.\n\n198\n00:09:56.219 --> 00:09:59.919\n&gt;&gt; Definitely yeah you need\nto be very specific and I've,\n\n199\n00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:01.815\nI watch tutorials on Excel.\n\n200\n00:10:01.815 --> 00:10:04.252\n[LAUGH] I mean, I watch all\nthe tutorials on everything, and\n\n201\n00:10:04.252 --> 00:10:05.440\nit is a very common problem.\n\n202\n00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.680\nAnd there isn't any of those show,\nhide characters like you have in Word,\n\n203\n00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:12.710\nwhere you can see every space, every tab,\ncuz it just doesn't work that way, so\n\n204\n00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.340\njust be careful.\n\n205\n00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:17.580\nNow, if you get rid of that space\nwhich I have and notice that okay,\n\n206\n00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:21.640\nnow it meets the criteria, and\nit will go ahead and do that conditional.\n\n207\n00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:25.120\nFormatting, so\ndefinitely pointing that out.\n\n208\n00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.470\nSo let's clear out the rules\nhere on the entire sheet.\n\n209\n00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:32.430\nJust to show you a couple\nother things with the text,\n\n210\n00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:33.950\nI can go over the additional formatting.\n\n211\n00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:36.140\nLet's just select all of the worksheet.\n\n212\n00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.950\nWe'll go and select all, well actually\nit's not all of the worksheet it's just\n\n213\n00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:44.215\nthe range, and even I got you, Daniel,\nand Mike in there hanging out with us.\n\n214\n00:10:44.215 --> 00:10:46.630\n[LAUGH] So\nwe're gonna go to Conditional Format.\n\n215\n00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:50.490\nWe'll go to Cells and\nwe will do the the Text that Contains.\n\n216\n00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:55.240\nWhat does it contain, well, it shows this,\n\n217\n00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.500\n15 Willoughby Blvd because\nthat was the cell that.\n\n218\n00:10:58.500 --> 00:10:59.940\nHere, let me cancel that.\n\n219\n00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:04.000\nNotice that this was the one\nthat I was selected on.\n\n220\n00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.571\nI did my Ctrl+A, so\nit's kind of like a focusing.\n\n221\n00:11:06.571 --> 00:11:10.120\nWe'll say that bat still has\nthe focus within the selected range.\n\n222\n00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:14.290\nAnd so\nthat's why it was pulling that particular\n\n223\n00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:19.070\nitem when I told it to do\nthe text that contains.\n\n224\n00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:19.900\nBut I don't want that.\n\n225\n00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:26.200\nIf I type in F-L, thinking for Florida,\nbut look at what it also brought in.\n\n226\n00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.550\nIt shows flower, okay, and anything else.\n\n227\n00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:34.210\nIf I typed in MA notice\nthat MA is in Maine Street.\n\n228\n00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:38.320\nIt's in marketing,\nit's just hey it's in there.\n\n229\n00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.710\n&gt;&gt;

to another great\nepisode of OfficePro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.402 --> 00:00:13.567\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode, well,\n\n5\n00:00:13.567 --> 00:00:17.128\nwe're coming back at you with more\nof our Excel 2016 Advanced series,\n\n6\n00:00:17.128 --> 00:00:20.400\nmaking sure that I get that right for\nyou good folks out there.\n\n7\n00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.808\nJoining us back in the studio yet\nagain to lend her expertise on that topic,\n\n8\n00:00:23.808 --> 00:00:25.499\nour good friend, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:26.731\nVonne, we're glad to have you again.\n\n10\n00:00:26.731 --> 00:00:27.558\nHow's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:27.558 --> 00:00:28.581\n&gt;&gt; It's wonderful.\n\n12\n00:00:28.581 --> 00:00:29.464\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n13\n00:00:29.464 --> 00:00:31.309\n&gt;&gt; We're going to be outlining and\n\n14\n00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:32.203\nsubtotaling.\n\n15\n00:00:32.203 --> 00:00:33.644\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Outlining and subtotaling, sounds good.\n\n16\n00:00:33.644 --> 00:00:36.054\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We've been doing so much singing, and\n\n17\n00:00:36.054 --> 00:00:37.580\nlately and we-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we have.\n\n18\n00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.744\n&gt;&gt; And we've been-\n&gt;&gt; That's not a joke.\n\n19\n00:00:38.744 --> 00:00:39.708\nWe've actually been singing-\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n20\n00:00:39.708 --> 00:00:42.309\nHe was making up some\namazing lyrics to Excel.\n\n21\n00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.934\n[LAUGH] It was pretty awesome, so.\n\n22\n00:00:44.934 --> 00:00:46.952\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you.\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, I got a little lost again and\n\n23\n00:00:46.952 --> 00:00:51.068\nwas like what are we doing, okay, yes,\nwe're gonna outline and subtotals.\n\n24\n00:00:51.068 --> 00:00:54.983\nNow this is where it's along the same\nlines of what we've been doing these last\n\n25\n00:00:54.983 --> 00:00:56.999\ncouple of episodes, with sorting, and\n\n26\n00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:01.060\nfiltering, and I just wanna see these with\nthese, and all of that kind of stuff.\n\n27\n00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.804\nWith this we're going to,\nif you think about an outline,\n\n28\n00:01:03.804 --> 00:01:05.603\nthere's different levels, right?\n\n29\n00:01:05.603 --> 00:01:08.897\nOkay, this is our main level,\nand these are our sublevels, and\n\n30\n00:01:08.897 --> 00:01:12.442\nmaybe another sublevel, and so\nwe kinda break that out into pieces.\n\n31\n00:01:12.442 --> 00:01:16.743\nWell, that's exactly what we're\ngonna be doing in outlining,\n\n32\n00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:21.762\nis saying, I want to have this grouped\ntogether and this grouped together.\n\n33\n00:01:21.762 --> 00:01:26.417\nAnd then what I can do is I can be\nable to show and hide those groups.\n\n34\n00:01:26.417 --> 00:01:29.770\nI can collapse and\nexpand them to be able to see.\n\n35\n00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.830\nSo this is similar to what we did in\nour Essential series when we were\n\n36\n00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.251\ndoing our hiding columns, where we\nselected some columns and hid them,\n\n37\n00:01:38.251 --> 00:01:41.745\nbecause we didn't want them\nto be there when we printed.\n\n38\n00:01:41.745 --> 00:01:44.494\nBut as we found out, it was like,\nwell, how do I unhide them?\n\n39\n00:01:44.494 --> 00:01:45.634\nWell, that's is not very intuitive.\n\n40\n00:01:45.634 --> 00:01:47.898\nYou have like select where it was and\nunhide them.\n\n41\n00:01:47.898 --> 00:01:53.485\nWith here there's little buttons, there's\nlittle controls that can be able to show,\n\n42\n00:01:53.485 --> 00:01:57.952\nand collapse, and hide different\nparts of it, so it's pretty cool.\n\n43\n00:01:57.952 --> 00:02:02.416\nSo we're gonna go through doing some\nmanual outlining and grouping, and\n\n44\n00:02:02.416 --> 00:02:07.096\nthen I'll also show you how to do an auto\noutline and what the criterias are for\n\n45\n00:02:07.096 --> 00:02:09.117\nbeing able to do an auto outline.\n\n46\n00:02:09.117 --> 00:02:13.997\nAnd then, another one of my favorite\nthings would be our subtotals, and\n\n47\n00:02:13.997 --> 00:02:16.730\nhow easy it is to be able to create them.\n\n48\n00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.394\nSo let's jump down into this particular\nfile called outline and subtotals.\n\n49\n00:02:22.394 --> 00:02:26.850\nAnd I have a worksheet right here called\noutline manual, because if I went into\n\n50\n00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.410\nhere and just went up into our Data tab,\nbecause that's where our grouping is\n\n51\n00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.080\nassociated over here into the outline\ngroup, and the Group and Ungroup button.\n\n52\n00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.430\nIf I came in here and said,\nlet's go ahead and auto outline,\n\n53\n00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.990\nit's gonna say I don't understand.\n\n54\n00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.760\nI can't see what you want me to outline,\n\n55\n00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.111\nbecause auto outline is\nonly based on formulas.\n\n56\n00:02:50.111 --> 00:02:53.481\nOkay, so let's keep that in the back\nof our minds for right now, and\n\n57\n00:02:53.481 --> 00:02:55.920\nsay okay,\nlet's move on to manually grouping.\n\n58\n00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.513\nSo I have the marketing department, and\n\n59\n00:02:59.513 --> 00:03:03.396\nthe marketing department is broken\nup into graphics and web and sales.\n\n60\n00:03:03.396 --> 00:03:08.107\nSo those are our two main departments,\nif you want, or subdepartments, and\n\n61\n00:03:08.107 --> 00:03:10.040\nwithin those you have groups.\n\n62\n00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.930\nSo we have some people that\nare in the social media group and\n\n63\n00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.910\nsome people that are in the design group.\n\n64\n00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.540\nAnd so same thing down here,\nwe have developers and we have sales.\n\n65\n00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.771\nSo I wanna be able to collapse down.\n\n66\n00:03:22.771 --> 00:03:25.390\nI don't wanna see web sales,\nI only wanna see graphics.\n\n67\n00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.220\nAnd then I only wanna see the design\npeople and not the social media.\n\n68\n00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.930\nSo you'll get the idea once I\nkind of just start doing it, but\n\n69\n00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.780\nthat's the kind of logic behind it.\n\n70\n00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.980\nSo what do I need to do\nto start grouping things?\n\n71\n00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.250\nWell, you gotta select, for this example,\nthe rows that we're going to do.\n\n72\n00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:49.379\nWe are going to select rows 4 through 15,\nright there.\n\n73\n00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.577\nSo all of this needs to be one group.\n\n74\n00:03:52.577 --> 00:03:56.718\nSo select them, come up here to Group,\nand then you go ahead and\n\n75\n00:03:56.718 --> 00:03:58.920\nclick on them, and there you go.\n\n76\n00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.970\nNow what it does is it creates this\nlevel over here, like our outline level.\n\n77\n00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.000\nAnd I have numbers one and\nI have numbers two.\n\n78\n00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.280\nAnd right now this is\nthe only group that I have.\n\n79\n00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.855\nWell if I click on one, notice I see\n[SOUND] well, there it collapses it up and\n\n80\n00:04:13.855 --> 00:04:18.450\nthen I can click on group two, it's\nlike show all and then collapse it all.\n\n81\n00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.799\nNow since there's only one, it's okay,\nI get the idea, but let's keep going so\n\n82\n00:04:22.799 --> 00:04:26.078\nwe can see the real power of\ngetting into multiple groups, and\n\n83\n00:04:26.078 --> 00:04:28.395\nthen groups within a group within a group.\n\n84\n00:04:28.395 --> 00:04:29.879\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let's come down into here.\n\n85\n00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:34.682\nWe will now select rows 18 through 29.\n\n86\n00:04:34.682 --> 00:04:36.198\nAnd l want this to be a group.\n\n87\n00:04:36.198 --> 00:04:37.869\nSo let's click on that group.\n\n88\n00:04:37.869 --> 00:04:42.657\nAnd notice that it did not make\na number three because this is on\n\n89\n00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:45.246\nthat same level as our graphics.\n\n90\n00:04:45.246 --> 00:04:48.930\nIt's like okay, this is Roman numeral\nI and then Roman numeral II, or\n\n91\n00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.302\nRoman numeral in A and\nB, that kind of stuff,\n\n92\n00:04:51.302 --> 00:04:54.689\nwhen you're thinking about outlines,\nso there's our level.\n\n93\n00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:58.547\nWell, now if I click on number one, notice\nhow that collapses both of them down.\n\n94\n00:04:58.547 --> 00:05:02.473\nAnd now I can click on our\ndifferent expand buttons to say,\n\n95\n00:05:02.473 --> 00:05:06.337\nwell let me just go ahead and\nexpand out the web and sales.\n\n96\n00:05:06.337 --> 00:05:07.658\nLet me collapse that.\n\n97\n00:05:07.658 --> 00:05:09.970\nLet me expand out the graphics.\n\n98\n00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.221\nSo if you think about if,\nyou had a lot of information,\n\n99\n00:05:13.221 --> 00:05:17.265\nespecially if it's going and\nspanning across 10,000 rows.\n\n100\n00:05:17.265 --> 00:05:21.433\nYeah, it might take you a little time to\ngo ahead and set up the groups in those\n\n101\n00:05:21.433 --> 00:05:25.930\n10,000 rows, but then if you could go\nahead and collapse those all down with\n\n102\n00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.284\none click of a button,\nthat's huge, and it's not hiding.\n\n103\n00:05:29.284 --> 00:05:32.271\nWe're just being able to\nhave these control buttons.\n\n104\n00:05:32.271 --> 00:05:34.985\nAnd I can quickly click on them,\nand a little bit more,\n\n105\n00:05:34.985 --> 00:05:37.936\nI would say a little bit more\nintuitive than the hiding, and\n\n106\n00:05:37.936 --> 00:05:40.680\nthen having to unhide them,\nand so on, and so forth.\n\n107\n00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.560\nSo pretty fun, nice control right there.\n\n108\n00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.541\nLet's keep on going one more level.\n\n109\n00:05:46.541 --> 00:05:49.796\nWe need another level on our outline,\nanother group,\n\n110\n00:05:49.796 --> 00:05:53.670\nbecause these social media people\nover here, they are a group.\n\n111\n00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.590\nSo I'm going to select rows 5 through 8.\n\n112\n00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.190\nCome up here to Data &gt; Group,\nand now I've made a level three.\n\n113\n00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.370\nSo now another level of where\nI can expand and collapse.\n\n114\n00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.886\nSo notice if I click the minus sign I can\ncollapse out the social media people and\n\n115\n00:06:10.886 --> 00:06:12.535\njust see the design people.\n\n116\n00:06:12.535 --> 00:06:15.981\nBut they're all part of the graphic,\nso then I can go ahead and\n\n117\n00:06:15.981 --> 00:06:19.162\ncontrol that, or\nI can collapse down the whole group, or\n\n118\n00:06:19.162 --> 00:06:21.833\nbe able to see all of them\nif I click on the three.\n\n119\n00:06:21.833 --> 00:06:26.680\nSo these are my main levels, and then the\nindividual parts that I can go through.\n\n120\n00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.780\nSo if I come down here,\n\n121\n00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.940\njust to kinda complete the example,\nlet's take our developers.\n\n122\n00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.710\nSelect our rows, come over here to group,\nand now I have my different\n\n123\n00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:42.409\nlevels of where I need to be able\nto outline or group my information.\n\n124\n00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:45.890\nPretty handy, pretty cool,\nI really like those.\n\n125\n00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:49.307\nNow, it's not just for\ncolumns, no, these are rows.\n\n126\n00:06:49.307 --> 00:06:50.353\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's not just for rows,\n\n127\n00:06:50.353 --> 00:06:51.546\nit's for columns, as well.\n\n128\n00:06:51.546 --> 00:06:54.549\nSo that's where I was going to,\ncuz I had here,\n\n129\n00:06:54.549 --> 00:06:58.619\ncuz sometimes your worksheets go\nthis way rather than this way.\n\n130\n00:06:58.619 --> 00:07:02.053\nSo I wanna be able to keep the first and\nlast, and we had done the freeze.\n\n131\n00:07:02.053 --> 00:07:03.018\nRemember, you loved that freeze.\n\n132\n00:07:03.018 --> 00:07:04.685\n&gt;&gt; I do, it was amazing.\n\n133\n00:07:04.685 --> 00:07:07.051\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well,\nthis is the same, but different.\n\n134\n00:07:07.051 --> 00:07:08.510\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; My favorite saying.\n\n135\n00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:12.937\nSo if I come over here to, I wanna see\ntheir First, Last name, and their Group,\n\n136\n00:07:12.937 --> 00:07:17.779\nbut I don't really need to see their Phone\nNumber, Address, City, State, and Zip.\n\n137\n00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:22.015\nI just wanna really be able to kinda\nmove this over, collapse this down, and\n\n138\n00:07:22.015 --> 00:07:24.340\nbe able to see their\nteam color next to it.\n\n139\n00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.280\nSo select your columns, same thing,\njust go with the Group.\n\n140\n00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.200\nAnd now I've got a collapsible and\nexpandable button at the top so I can\n\n141\n00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:37.480\ncollapse that down, come into my different\nlevels, expand and collapse these guys.\n\n142\n00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.530\nAnd then we can have a lot\nmore control over what\n\n143\n00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:45.890\nI'm seeing in our different groupings,\nwhich is really outlining, so.\n\n144\n00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:49.835\n&gt;&gt; I bet it can be getting really\ncrazy yet powerful at the same time if\n\n145\n00:07:49.835 --> 00:07:54.457\nyou started using the sorting and\nfiltering along with the grouping?\n\n146\n00:07:54.457 --> 00:07:56.036\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthat's exactly what you can do.\n\n147\n00:07:56.036 --> 00:08:00.916\nI mean, you could go ahead and throw those\nfilters on there, and cuz now this could\n\n148\n00:08:00.916 --> 00:08:05.185\nbe a filter right here and then I only\nwanna see the red, so a lot of ways.\n\n149\n00:08:05.185 --> 00:08:09.520\nAnd think about if again, we've talked\nabout 600,000 rows or what have you.\n\n150\n00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:14.040\nDo a little bit of outlining so you can\ncollapse and expand out this sections.\n\n151\n00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.607\nGo ahead and throw on those auto filters\nor when we get into tables go ahead and\n\n152\n00:08:17.607 --> 00:08:20.080\nput those on the tables and\nso you can do all of these.\n\n153\n00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.885\nYou can really start to be able to\nanalyze that data with a large amount,\n\n154\n00:08:24.885 --> 00:08:30.110\nto just say, this is what I need to focus\non and that's where we can organize.\n\n155\n00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:34.605\nAnd be able to make those\ndeterminations as to what that trouble,\n\n156\n00:08:34.605 --> 00:08:37.510\npause and\nsales on team red actually means.\n\n157\n00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:38.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n158\n00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:39.495\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know it's just a demo.\n\n159\n00:08:39.495 --> 00:08:41.445\nSo it's like okay great,\nwell then he's on team red.\n\n160\n00:08:41.445 --> 00:08:44.535\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's funny when you get into\nreal data, something that's there and\n\n161\n00:08:44.535 --> 00:08:45.875\nit means something to you.\n\n162\n00:08:45.875 --> 00:08:47.773\nAll this stuff starts to\nmake a whole lot more sense.\n\n163\n00:08:47.773 --> 00:08:50.485\nAnd you start going,\nyou know what I could do?\n\n164\n00:08:50.485 --> 00:08:51.455\nI learned this on the show.\n\n165\n00:08:51.455 --> 00:08:52.765\nI could do this and I could do that.\n\n166\n00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:55.985\nAnd this will be a whole lot easier\nto see now and the heavens open.\n\n167\n00:08:55.985 --> 00:08:58.595\nAnd angels descent holding\none long know that's amazing.\n\n168\n00:08:58.595 --> 00:08:59.749\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] Yes, exactly.\n\n169\n00:08:59.749 --> 00:09:00.411\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just like that.\n\n170\n00:09:00.411 --> 00:09:02.806\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm not sure those are right key\n\n171\n00:09:02.806 --> 00:09:04.210\n[LAUGH], but close enough.\n\n172\n00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:05.230\n&gt;&gt; Kinda hold your ear right and [SOUND].\n\n173\n00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:09.008\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like [INAUDIBLE].\n\n174\n00:09:09.008 --> 00:09:11.620\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, I was in marching band so\n\n175\n00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:12.630\nwe had to do that.\n\n176\n00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:15.847\nYou'd sing the parts and\neverything and then you realize,\n\n177\n00:09:15.847 --> 00:09:17.600\nthat's really awesome [LAUGH].\n\n178\n00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.038\nI'm really good and that person's not.\n\n179\n00:09:21.038 --> 00:09:23.139\n&gt;&gt; Man, I should practice.\n\n180\n00:09:23.139 --> 00:09:24.939\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n181\n00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:26.077\nI would practice in the closet.\n\n182\n00:09:26.077 --> 00:09:26.842\n&gt;&gt; Did you really?\n\n183\n00:09:26.842 --> 00:09:28.594\n&gt;&gt; Because I don't want everybody\nin the house to hear me.\n\n184\n00:09:28.594 --> 00:09:30.926\nI don't know, I was a wierd kid so.\n\n185\n00:09:30.926 --> 00:09:33.255\nYeah, that was first year so yeah, anyway.\n\n186\n00:09:33.255 --> 00:09:34.148\n&gt;&gt; Well, something to be\nsaid of your method though.\n\n187\n00:09:34.148 --> 00:09:37.156\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I think I was\njust naturally talented.\n\n188\n00:09:37.156 --> 00:09:38.702\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, could be.\n\n189\n00:09:38.702 --> 00:09:40.310\nMoving on!\n\n190\n00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.900\n&gt;&gt; Here we go.\n&gt;&gt; Squirrel!\n\n191\n00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:41.630\n&gt;&gt; I know, right?\n\n192\n00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.370\nWe're talking about music again.\n\n193\n00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:44.530\nWe're breaking out into song.\n\n194\n00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:46.860\nWe're talking about playing flutes.\n\n195\n00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.415\n&gt;&gt; The soundtrack of our lives.\n\n196\n00:09:48.415 --> 00:09:48.915\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n197\n00:09:48.915 --> 00:09:51.480\nOr like seance of the hourglass?\n\n198\n00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.605\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nThese are the days of our lives.\n\n199\n00:09:53.605 --> 00:09:55.810\n&gt;&gt; Okay and\nback to our outlining and grouping.\n\n200\n00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:58.700\nIf I don't want to have any\nof this stuff going on,\n\n201\n00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:03.100\nbecause sometimes you get into grouping\nit up, and now not really sure.\n\n202\n00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.270\nYou can individually pick out the parts.\n\n203\n00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:09.390\nCuz maybe I don't want the group\non the columns anymore.\n\n204\n00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:14.180\nSo notice if I have this selected,\nI could ungroup this\n\n205\n00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:18.320\nby clicking the ungroup, but\nI'm not taking everything off.\n\n206\n00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.370\nSo I can take that off,\nand now everything's fine.\n\n207\n00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:23.470\nI could also come into here,\n\n208\n00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:27.930\nI could select my rows that I\ndo not want to have grouped.\n\n209\n00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:31.510\nAnd I can ungroup that and noticed that\nthe level over here on the right hand that\n\n210\n00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:35.470\nwould be the other right,\nthe left hand side will be removed.\n\n211\n00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:38.190\nSo you can't individually take things off.\n\n212\n00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:41.560\nBut if you're like,\nyou know what I've got a little messed up,\n\n213\n00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.080\nI've got myself gonna\npainted into a corner.\n\n214\n00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.330\nI went a little too\ncrazy with my grouping,\n\n215\n00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.180\nI don't know where I'm at anymore.\n\n216\n00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.240\nYou can come up to ungroup and\n\n217\n00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:54.150\nthen if you drop this down,\nnotice it just says clear the outline.\n\n218\n00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:58.040\nAnd once you clear everything,\nwell let's go ahead and clear that again.\n\n219\n00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.235\nLet's go ahead and\nhave anything selected first.\n\n220\n00:11:00.235 --> 00:11:02.130\n[LAUGH] And\nthen we will go to clear outline,\n\n221\n00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:05.550\nthat's what I was having it try to do and\nnotice that it is gone.\n\n222\n00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:10.250\nDo note that if I clear the outline,\nyou can't undo.\n\n223\n00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:12.780\nThat was a,\nwhen we were working with the sheet tabs,\n\n224\n00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.640\nonce you delete something or like, that's-\n&gt;&gt; I get it.\n\n225\n00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nIt's committed.\n\n226\n00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:18.780\nSo, you can't undo that.\n\n227\n00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.810\nBut the nice thing is\nyour data is not gone.\n\n228\n00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:24.380\nIt's just then you would have\nto re-setup like your groups and\n\n229\n00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.520\nhow you want to organize it.\n\n230\n00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.750\nAnd so, yeah that’s a good point to make.\n\n231\n00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.430\nAnd it’s funny when you say like when\nyou get in the real world its like,\n\n232\n00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:34.110\nmy gosh this is so amazing.\n\n233\n00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:35.690\nBut then the other thing\nis like if it’s not,\n\n234\n00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:39.880\nif it’s not organized a certain way or\nit’s not consistent.\n\n235\n00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.270\nThat’s another thing, it’s like I saw\nthis amazing tutorial and I go to myself,\n\n236\n00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:44.980\nlike this isn't working.\n\n237\n00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah there’s got to be reasons and\n\n238\n00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:49.450\nmethodologies that you're\ndoing certain things.\n\n239\n00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:52.150\nAnd then you stay within those boundaries.\n\n240\n00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:54.860\nIt'll become the standard way in which\nyou do them, everyone will know, and\n\n241\n00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:56.160\nnow everything will make sense.\n\n242\n00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.100\nIt'll be awesome.\n\n243\n00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.530\nIf you just start clicking stuff and\nturning stuff on because it's cool and\n\n244\n00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.060\nit looks neat.\n\n245\n00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:03.960\nYou could really make it a jumbled,\n\n246\n00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.190\nhot mess that no one has any idea\nwhat's going on, even yourself.\n\n247\n00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:10.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and then that's where like your\ndata, it may be organized one way that\n\n248\n00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:15.730\nlike really works well with x, but\nit doesn't really work well with y.\n\n249\n00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:17.570\nSo it takes a while.\n\n250\n00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.210\nThat's where [INAUDIBLE],\nI could do, let me try it this way.\n\n251\n00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:23.230\nAnd like trying to find\nthe workarounds and it takes a while.\n\n252\n00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:26.830\nSo it has to be, there has to be\nlike the kind of perfect storm or\n\n253\n00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:28.310\nI guess a perfect match.\n\n254\n00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:29.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz storm has a weird connotation.\n\n255\n00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:31.903\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Like you know death and destruction or\n\n256\n00:12:31.903 --> 00:12:35.110\nsomething like that and we don't\nwant to think about that and stuff.\n\n257\n00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:35.840\n&gt;&gt; Maybe where you go from.\n\n258\n00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.508\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I did grow up in Florida and\n\n259\n00:12:37.508 --> 00:12:38.842\na hurricanes they will come and get you.\n\n260\n00:12:38.842 --> 00:12:39.426\n&gt;&gt; Yes they will-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n261\n00:12:39.426 --> 00:12:39.968\n&gt;&gt; Won't they?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n262\n00:12:39.968 --> 00:12:41.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right so\n\n263\n00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.650\nlet's move on to auto outlining.\n\n264\n00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:49.060\nThis is the one where it's just set up,\nagain, if it's set up perfectly,\n\n265\n00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.130\nlook, poof, it works.\n\n266\n00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:52.145\nIt always works perfectly\nin the tutorials.\n\n267\n00:12:52.145 --> 00:12:59.400\n[LAUGH] So in here,\nauto outlining does work on your formulas.\n\n268\n00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.360\nJust to walk through you, and\n\n269\n00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:04.170\nI've been saying the whole time, we're not\ngonna talk about formulas in this series.\n\n270\n00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:08.880\nWell, we're gonna go ahead and correlate\nthis into this particular episode in\n\n271\n00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:14.530\nthe sense like the daily totals here for\nMonday notice that it is summing up.\n\n272\n00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.314\nWhat it is?\n\n273\n00:13:17.314 --> 00:13:19.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is B4 [LAUGH] can't even read\n\n274\n00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:26.220\nthe formula, B4 through B7, so that's\nthe addition, okay the total for here.\n\n275\n00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.840\nSame with the daily totals for\nthe week of July 10th,\n\n276\n00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:34.570\nit is adding up cells B11 through B14.\n\n277\n00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:41.550\nAnd then down here, our biweekly totals,\nit's adding up cells B8 and B15.\n\n278\n00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:46.490\nSo it notices that it's taking this cell,\nB15 and\n\n279\n00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:49.650\nB8 and adding them all up.\n\n280\n00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:56.570\nSo it sees, it's gonna find those\nlevels based on those formulas.\n\n281\n00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:58.100\nSo let me show you.\n\n282\n00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:58.830\nClick on right here.\n\n283\n00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:03.110\nAnd I'm gonna scroll out just\na little bit in this worksheet.\n\n284\n00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:04.990\nThat's a little too much.\n\n285\n00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:05.670\nJust so you can see.\n\n286\n00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:06.290\nDon't worry, there we go.\n\n287\n00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:08.230\nPerfect.\nSo you can kinda see the whole thing.\n\n288\n00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:14.920\nClicking anywhere in my worksheet, coming\nover here to Data, going over to Group,\n\n289\n00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:19.320\nand going into Auto Outline, watch what\nhappens, and just poof, there you go.\n\n290\n00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:23.510\nNotice it puts the little buttons\nover to the left that we had before.\n\n291\n00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:25.250\nIt has 1's, 2's and 3's.\n\n292\n00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:30.250\nIf I clicked on the 2, look,\nit collapse all the details.\n\n293\n00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:33.130\nOf those particular groups, and\njust shows me the daily totals and\n\n294\n00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:34.860\nthe biweekly totals.\n\n295\n00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:39.340\nIf I click on the number 1, then it's\nonly gonna show me that top level,\n\n296\n00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:47.060\nlike the biweekly totals is the product\nof the ends of the groups of the level 2,\n\n297\n00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:51.700\nand then level 3 are all the details\nof those particular formulas.\n\n298\n00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:56.600\nSo really handy if everything's set\nup in a way that will allow it.\n\n299\n00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.070\nAnd there's plenty of\nspreadsheets that will\n\n300\n00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:01.250\nlook like this depending on how\nyou're going to be doing it.\n\n301\n00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:04.360\nBut again,\nyou can throw those auto outline on it and\n\n302\n00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.634\nit's like I have no idea\nwhat it's grouping.\n\n303\n00:15:06.634 --> 00:15:09.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just the way the information works.\n\n304\n00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:12.140\nSo and it does go ahead and\nput this up here at the top.\n\n305\n00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:17.180\nNotice because it saw that I\nhad weekly sales that was doing\n\n306\n00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:23.080\na formula going across of summing up all\nof the cells for Monday through Friday.\n\n307\n00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:27.540\nAnd so it puts a group at the top\nwith our columns as well.\n\n308\n00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:32.860\nSo really easy if everything\nworks out perfectly in your data.\n\n309\n00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:36.590\nOkay, subtotals.\n\n310\n00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:37.440\n&gt;&gt; Last, but not least.\n\n311\n00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.850\n&gt;&gt; Last, but not least, I love this one,\nokay, when you think about.\n\n312\n00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:45.540\nIf I'm subtotaling anything you go ahead\nand make a subtotal for this group and\n\n313\n00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:48.420\nthen a subtotal for this group and then\nthere's a grand total at the end right?\n\n314\n00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:49.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n315\n00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.360\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what we're\ngoing to do with this.\n\n316\n00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.675\nNow just turn and\ntake a look at the information we have,\n\n317\n00:15:53.675 --> 00:15:56.777\nthe marketing department, we have\nteam colors, we have number of calls,\n\n318\n00:15:56.777 --> 00:15:58.568\nso we have these different things in here.\n\n319\n00:15:58.568 --> 00:16:03.107\nThe biggest thing that you need\nto know about before you start\n\n320\n00:16:03.107 --> 00:16:07.913\nadding your subtotals is,\nyou've got to make sure that you sort\n\n321\n00:16:07.913 --> 00:16:12.722\nbased on the column that you want\neverything to make a subtotal.\n\n322\n00:16:12.722 --> 00:16:16.646\nDraw almost like a physical line and\nadd them up, or\n\n323\n00:16:16.646 --> 00:16:19.410\ncount them up, or average them up.\n\n324\n00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:21.730\nYou have to sort.\n\n325\n00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:26.020\nNow this is where, what I want to\nhave these subtotals added to.\n\n326\n00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.400\nThis particular example,\nwe're gonna go by departments.\n\n327\n00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.150\nSo I'm gonna click in department,\nI'm going to come over to home and\n\n328\n00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:33.370\nI'm going to sort and filter.\n\n329\n00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:35.060\nI'll make it this A to Z, so\n\n330\n00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:39.450\nI can see all the advertising,\nall the marketing, all the sales.\n\n331\n00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:41.990\nNow notice,\nI could have done it by team color but\n\n332\n00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:45.990\nyou can only have it at one one change in.\n\n333\n00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:47.500\nAnd you'll see the dialogue\nbox in a second.\n\n334\n00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:52.140\nSo at every change in department,\nso all the advertising,\n\n335\n00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:56.660\nadd up the number of calls or\nadd up the number of sales.\n\n336\n00:16:56.660 --> 00:17:00.450\nAnd then add the marketing and the sales\nand then give me a grand total at the end.\n\n337\n00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:01.200\nAll right, here we go.\n\n338\n00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:07.035\nSo, sort once, come over to data,\ngo over to subtotals.\n\n339\n00:17:07.035 --> 00:17:10.623\nAnd then notice that it had, well, since\nI had my cell selected, it selected that\n\n340\n00:17:10.623 --> 00:17:14.370\nrange of cells that it determined this\nis your contiguous range of information.\n\n341\n00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:17.150\nAt each change in,\n\n342\n00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:20.870\nand then column headings are gonna\nbe another important thing.\n\n343\n00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:22.590\nI mean, it would just say column A, B,\n\n344\n00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:25.110\nC, but\nheadings are always a good thing to have.\n\n345\n00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:29.680\nAt every change in department, cause\nthat's what we want, use this function.\n\n346\n00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:33.550\nNow we don't have to go deep\ninto functions to know sum,\n\n347\n00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.672\nsum's gonna probably do what?\n\n348\n00:17:35.672 --> 00:17:36.172\nIt's gonna-\n&gt;&gt; Add.\n\n349\n00:17:36.172 --> 00:17:36.704\n&gt;&gt; Add and\n\n350\n00:17:36.704 --> 00:17:40.060\nthen count is gonna count the numbers.\n\n351\n00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:43.980\nAverage, max, min, so\nlet's just kind of keep it at that.\n\n352\n00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:46.718\nI think it's pretty,\n&gt;&gt; Self-explanatory.\n\n353\n00:17:46.718 --> 00:17:49.300\n&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you [LAUGH] for the sum.\n\n354\n00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.440\nNow, where do you want\nthe add the subtotals?\n\n355\n00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.220\nIt wouldn't make any sense\nto add the subtotals for\n\n356\n00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.900\nthe first because they're not numbers.\n\n357\n00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.742\nWe want to add in, now,\nit automatically picks sales,\n\n358\n00:17:58.742 --> 00:18:02.384\njust because it sees that as the last\ncolumn, that's the only reason.\n\n359\n00:18:02.384 --> 00:18:05.700\nBut let's total up the number of calls and\nthe sales.\n\n360\n00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:06.990\nLet's see what that does.\n\n361\n00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:08.579\n&gt;&gt; Sounds fun.\n&gt;&gt; Cool, and replace,\n\n362\n00:18:08.579 --> 00:18:10.650\nwe'll talk about that in a second.\n\n363\n00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:12.901\nSummary, below the data, good, click okay.\n\n364\n00:18:12.901 --> 00:18:15.692\nAnd then [NOISE] there you go,\nlook at that.\n\n365\n00:18:15.692 --> 00:18:22.150\nIt went ahead and put in our levels so\nhere is the advertising totals.\n\n366\n00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:26.856\nThere's 31 calls, $108 in sales and\nthe marketing and then at the bottom.\n\n367\n00:18:26.856 --> 00:18:28.931\nBut this is where the fun stuff is.\n\n368\n00:18:28.931 --> 00:18:31.250\nWell, let me go ahead, and\nif I collapse down, neat.\n\n369\n00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:38.020\nI just went ahead and collapsed down\nmy different levels, like 2, 3, and 1.\n\n370\n00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:42.350\nAnd so now it gets that subtotals\nright there, what I need it to do.\n\n371\n00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:46.880\nSo really, really neat stuff, and\nreally easy if you sort it by this.\n\n372\n00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:50.193\nSo I use this particular thing in Excel\n\n373\n00:18:50.193 --> 00:18:53.720\na lot in what I need to\ndo a lot of the time.\n\n374\n00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:57.120\nSo let's go ahead and\nexpand this back out, love that.\n\n375\n00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:01.290\nSo now what if I wanted to,\ninstead of doing the summing,\n\n376\n00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:03.670\nlet's do just the average sales.\n\n377\n00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:07.110\nAnd I don't wanna have the adding\nof the calls in there.\n\n378\n00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:08.730\nSo click anywhere in here.\n\n379\n00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:10.220\nJust go right back in to subtotals,\n\n380\n00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:14.970\nbecause that replace current\nsubtotals with that checked on,\n\n381\n00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:18.230\nit's gonna remove everything that I\nalready did and do something new for me.\n\n382\n00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:23.030\nSo let's turn off the number of calls,\nlet's keep on the sales,\n\n383\n00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:27.200\nbut let's use the function of average and\nclick okay.\n\n384\n00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.035\nAnd notice if you have the page break,\ncuz if you have a lot of information,\n\n385\n00:19:30.035 --> 00:19:32.962\nyou might want to put page breaks in\nthere because you're printing this out.\n\n386\n00:19:32.962 --> 00:19:36.514\nThat could be another, okay, let's go\nahead and see what all of the departments\n\n387\n00:19:36.514 --> 00:19:39.977\ndid and what their weekly totals are,\ndo the sub-totals, and you're good.\n\n388\n00:19:39.977 --> 00:19:45.250\nClick on average, click OK, and now notice\nthat it does turn into our average.\n\n389\n00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:46.740\nWe go ahead and do it on that.\n\n390\n00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:49.484\nSo our grand average is about $43.\n\n391\n00:19:49.484 --> 00:19:51.910\nWow, they're not doing so\ngood in their sales now, are they?\n\n392\n00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:53.226\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, they're having a little trouble.\n\n393\n00:19:53.226 --> 00:19:53.780\n[LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n394\n00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:57.560\nwell, you know cat toys aren't that\nexpensive here at Christmas Cats, so.\n\n395\n00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:00.930\n&gt;&gt; And they're made by cats.\n\n396\n00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:02.740\nSo the quality isn't-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n397\n00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:03.690\n&gt;&gt; What we would hope it would be.\n\n398\n00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:06.835\n&gt;&gt; Yes, but they're probably playing\naround with them so much and\n\n399\n00:20:06.835 --> 00:20:08.120\ntearing them up and-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n400\n00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:08.871\n&gt;&gt; Putting it back to the side.\n\n401\n00:20:08.871 --> 00:20:11.222\n&gt;&gt; Put that in the package and ship it.\n\n402\n00:20:11.222 --> 00:20:13.250\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH] exactly.\n\n403\n00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:14.690\nAll right, so that's how we got there.\n\n404\n00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:19.620\nNow we have our average sales but\nnow maybe I want average sales and\n\n405\n00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:24.730\nthe number of calls I wanna count or\na total of the number of calls.\n\n406\n00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:29.610\nThis is where if you wanted two separate\nfunctions in a sense, let's total\n\n407\n00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:34.810\nup the sales and let's, wait right now,\nwe're doing average of the sales.\n\n408\n00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:40.450\nAnd then we're going to do the summing or\nadding up of the number of calls.\n\n409\n00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:44.012\nGo back into the sub totals but\nthis time, but\n\n410\n00:20:44.012 --> 00:20:46.840\nthis time turn off the replace\ncurrent sub totals.\n\n411\n00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.990\nSo you're gonna have to do one at a time.\n\n412\n00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:52.960\nSo if you turn off replace then it's\ngonna keep what ever is already there.\n\n413\n00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:58.790\nAnd lets add in the sum into\nthat to the number of calls.\n\n414\n00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:01.583\nTurn off the sales cuz you\ndon't wanna add up the sales.\n\n415\n00:21:01.583 --> 00:21:03.209\nBut, I mean,\nactually you could if you want to,\n\n416\n00:21:03.209 --> 00:21:04.740\nwhy don't we keep it on there, okay?\n\n417\n00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.690\nSo, but we're not going to\nreplace anything that's there.\n\n418\n00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:10.180\nWe click, OK and then there you go.\n\n419\n00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:17.260\nNotice that we now have totals and\naverages on both sales, the average and\n\n420\n00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:22.350\ntotal on the sales, the totals on\nthe calls and then we get our grand total.\n\n421\n00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:29.830\nSo you can do multiple subtotals and\nmultiple functions on your information.\n\n422\n00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:32.970\nYou just have to do it twice,\nyou just make sure you uncheck that and\n\n423\n00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:33.610\nthen take it off.\n\n424\n00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:35.460\nSo again, super handy,\n\n425\n00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:40.750\nit's one of those kinda logical as long as\nyou kinda think of it in logical steps.\n\n426\n00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:43.610\nSort it, go ahead and\nput all subtotals on.\n\n427\n00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:46.590\nAnd then there you go, you can kinda\nplay around with this, and it's really,\n\n428\n00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:47.270\nreally handy.\n\n429\n00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:51.600\nNow what if I went ahead and said,\nI don't want these subtotals anymore?\n\n430\n00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.780\nAnywhere within that range of information,\n\n431\n00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:58.560\ngo back to Subtotals, there is a Remove\nAll, just go ahead and take this off.\n\n432\n00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.080\nTake it off, and then there you go,\n\n433\n00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:04.020\nyou're back to your data,\nso love those functions.\n\n434\n00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:07.470\nOrganizing it with our groups and\ndoing our outlines so you can collapse and\n\n435\n00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:10.890\nexpand with buttons rather than\ntrying to find the unhides and\n\n436\n00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:13.040\nyou can't understand\nwhat's going on in there.\n\n437\n00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.460\nSo, different ways, again,\n\n438\n00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:18.658\nto analyze your data and be able to\nfind what you want out of those numbers.\n\n439\n00:22:18.658 --> 00:22:20.130\n&gt;&gt; Very cool, Vonne, and like I said,\n\n440\n00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:23.630\nI think this is a great thing that\nwe're going to continue to build upon\n\n441\n00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:26.500\nas we move through Excel, so\ngreat knowledge for you too.\n\n442\n00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.540\nPlay around with, mess around with and\n\n443\n00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:33.400\ngive yourself a little more\npower as an Excel user, right?\n\n444\n00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.680\nCuz its very, very handy to have around.\n\n445\n00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:38.570\nVonne, thanks for\nshowing up how we can do that very thing,\n\n446\n00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:40.960\nwe do thank our good audience\nout there for watching.\n\n447\n00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:41.550\nBut guess what?\n\n448\n00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:43.670\nIt's that time again for us to sign off.\n\n449\n00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:45.890\nFor Office PRO TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n450\n00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:50.447\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne

00:00:18.700\ncuz we're moving on with more in\nour Excel 2016 Advanced series.\n\n6\n00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.060\nIt's gonna be a lot of fun.\n\n7\n00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.400\nJoining us in the studio today to\nlend her expertise on that topic for\n\n8\n00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.270\nus, our good friend, Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.120\nVonne, how's it going today?\n\n10\n00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.425\n&gt;&gt; I'm super excited,\nas always when I'm on these episodes!\n\n11\n00:00:30.425 --> 00:00:33.406\n[LAUGH] But today we're gonna talk\nabout one of my favorite things,\n\n12\n00:00:33.406 --> 00:00:34.212\nwhich is tables.\n\n13\n00:00:34.212 --> 00:00:34.931\n&gt;&gt; Tables.\n\n14\n00:00:34.931 --> 00:00:37.955\n&gt;&gt; Tables, yes, in Excel.\n\n15\n00:00:37.955 --> 00:00:38.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n16\n00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.935\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; That didn't work.\n\n17\n00:00:39.935 --> 00:00:40.514\n&gt;&gt; No it didn't.\n[LAUGH]\n\n18\n00:00:40.514 --> 00:00:41.180\n&gt;&gt; Just shut it down.\n\n19\n00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.666\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but yes, we are gonna be talking\n\n20\n00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:48.325\nabout tables, and how to format\nour Excel worksheets into tables.\n\n21\n00:00:48.325 --> 00:00:50.945\nAnd so, well, first of all,\nwell, what is a table?\n\n22\n00:00:50.945 --> 00:00:52.343\nNow when we talk about-\n&gt;&gt; You put food on it, right?\n\n23\n00:00:52.343 --> 00:00:53.184\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then,\n\n24\n00:00:53.184 --> 00:00:54.304\neverybody sits down-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah!\n\n25\n00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:55.555\n&gt;&gt; And breaks bread, it's amazing.\n\n26\n00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:57.305\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly!\n\n27\n00:00:57.305 --> 00:01:01.520\nWell, in that same analogy, we all come\nto the table in an organized fashion.\n\n28\n00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.767\nAnd so we're all sitting around\na table and we're one unit, right?\n\n29\n00:01:04.767 --> 00:01:05.390\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n30\n00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.580\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nit's kind of the same thing in Excel.\n\n31\n00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.056\n&gt;&gt; The analogy holds true then,\nlet's move on.\n\n32\n00:01:09.056 --> 00:01:11.828\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Good job, totally ad libbed too.\n\n33\n00:01:11.828 --> 00:01:13.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was.\n\n34\n00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.680\n&gt;&gt; But that's exactly what\nwe're going to be doing.\n\n35\n00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.890\nWhen we talk about tables in Word or\nPowerPoint, then that's where it's like\n\n36\n00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.130\nokay, well we're gonna make columns and\nrows, and where they intersect is a cell.\n\n37\n00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.490\nThat's because, well PowerPoint and Word,\nthey're like blank pieces of paper.\n\n38\n00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.780\nIt's like, well Excel is a spreadsheet.\n\n39\n00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.540\nIt's already in columns and\nrows, so how is that a table?\n\n40\n00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.674\nWell in Excel, what that means is that,\nit's recognizing it as\n\n41\n00:01:40.674 --> 00:01:45.421\nan independent unit of data that has\nsome special features, that you're\n\n42\n00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:50.347\nable to add to your table to help with\nthe styles, and like the look and feel.\n\n43\n00:01:50.347 --> 00:01:55.383\nAnd also some kind of cool things that you\ncan do with some very simple functions,\n\n44\n00:01:55.383 --> 00:01:58.440\nor what are called sub\ntotals within our tables.\n\n45\n00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.520\nSo I think the best way to demonstrate\nour tables is to well, do it.\n\n46\n00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.320\nSo why don't we jump down\ninto our tables.xlsx file?\n\n47\n00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.040\nAnd we've been seeing a lot\nof the same information,\n\n48\n00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.950\nbecause we work at\nChristmas Cats Incorporated.\n\n49\n00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.181\n&gt;&gt; It's a great company, you should\ncheck out the Glassdoor on that.\n\n50\n00:02:19.181 --> 00:02:21.800\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so like cat toys abound,\n\n51\n00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.926\nand there's always free catnip,\nand treats and everything.\n\n52\n00:02:25.926 --> 00:02:27.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Man,\nscratching posts on every door.\n\n53\n00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.396\nIt's an amazing place.\n\n54\n00:02:28.396 --> 00:02:28.921\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n55\n00:02:28.921 --> 00:02:29.828\n&gt;&gt; She gonna love it.\n\n56\n00:02:29.828 --> 00:02:32.470\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n57\n00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.424\nAnd that CEO Fuego, man, he's a gem.\n\n58\n00:02:33.424 --> 00:02:34.053\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n59\n00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:35.975\nwe have some information here,\n\n60\n00:02:35.975 --> 00:02:39.542\nand this is everything we've\nbeen doing with Excel so far.\n\n61\n00:02:39.542 --> 00:02:43.668\nWe go ahead and put our data into our\ncells, and we have our row references and\n\n62\n00:02:43.668 --> 00:02:44.970\neverything like that.\n\n63\n00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.220\nAnd so we've done some sorting and\nsome filtering, but\n\n64\n00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.540\nwhat if I wanted to add\nin a row into this?\n\n65\n00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.450\nIf I right-click here over on row four.\n\n66\n00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.560\nAnd then go to insert.\n\n67\n00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.930\nThen it inserts an entire row into this\nworksheet, which then goes ahead and\n\n68\n00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.140\nputs that into, if you wanna say,\nthis group of information and\n\n69\n00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.730\nthis group of information, because\nthey're not seen as independent units.\n\n70\n00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.699\nThey're just data in one spreadsheet.\n\n71\n00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.260\nSo that's where we're gonna go ahead and\n\n72\n00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.430\nintroduce the whole idea of,\nlet's format this as a table.\n\n73\n00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.970\nSo I just did an undo right there,\nto not have that row inserted.\n\n74\n00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.320\nSo how do I tell this\ngroup of information,\n\n75\n00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.810\nthis contiguous range\nof cells to be a table?\n\n76\n00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.550\nYou just click anywhere in the table,\nall right?\n\n77\n00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.920\nAnd then you come up to the home tab,\n\n78\n00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.970\nthe little button that\nsays Conditional Format.\n\n79\n00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.390\nThat's not Conditional Format,\nwe're not doing Conditional Formatting,\n\n80\n00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.135\nwe're doing one more over.\n\n81\n00:03:43.135 --> 00:03:45.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's move over to where it says\n\n82\n00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.250\nFormat As Table.\n\n83\n00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.210\nPretty self explanatory, convert a range\nof cells to a table with its own style.\n\n84\n00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.200\nIf you click Hold or\njust click and drop-down,\n\n85\n00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.360\nit gives you this drop-down menu that\ngives you all of these default styles.\n\n86\n00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.410\nNow, what is a style?\n\n87\n00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.230\nWe've talked about this, that a style\nis just a named group of formatting.\n\n88\n00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.010\nSo we have here, for example,\nif I hover over these medium.\n\n89\n00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.640\nIt says that its name is\nwhite table medium four, and\n\n90\n00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.760\nthat's just the name of it.\n\n91\n00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.410\nAnd that's fine.\n\n92\n00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.920\nWhy don't we go ahead and click any one\nof them, just to at least get it started.\n\n93\n00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.560\nSo if I click, it says all right it\nnoticed that, because I was in that\n\n94\n00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.450\ncontiguous range of cells,\nit finds like where the data ends in here,\n\n95\n00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.290\nand it says, hey I've seen that,\nthis is saying from G1 to J13, yes.\n\n96\n00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.890\nIt does recognize that my table\nis going to have headers.\n\n97\n00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.220\nCuz we do have a header\nrow of information.\n\n98\n00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.160\nHeaders are always good.\n\n99\n00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.800\nYou always want to label the tops of\nyour columns as what is this data.\n\n100\n00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.820\nWe click, OK, and then there you go.\n\n101\n00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.450\nWe have formatted this as a table.\n\n102\n00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.600\nI'm gonna just click off this like,\nin it so you can see.\n\n103\n00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.430\nA few things to notice when we do this,\nyou have a contextual tab,\n\n104\n00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.650\nthe contextual tab at the top says that\nthis is the design tab of the table tools.\n\n105\n00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.240\nAnd we will go through a lot of these\noptions, as we go through this episode.\n\n106\n00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.970\nBut right now, I just wanted you to\nnotice that I have a contextual tab.\n\n107\n00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.650\nWonderful, notice the other thing\nthat happens is we have our filters.\n\n108\n00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.190\nWe've talked about these little filter\nbuttons in our sort and filter episode.\n\n109\n00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.980\nSo that automatically gets added.\n\n110\n00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:25.580\nAnd it's the same options that we had\nin our filters with the same sorts,\n\n111\n00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.530\nand what do I want to see and\nnot see in this particular table?\n\n112\n00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:37.620\nThis is saying that this is one area\nthat is independent then another area.\n\n113\n00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.760\nI am going to scootch over,\nfor just a second so\n\n114\n00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.150\nyou can see this a little better.\n\n115\n00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.980\nThe other thing to notice,\n\n116\n00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.010\nwhen you formatted something as a table,\nlike how can I know that this is a table.\n\n117\n00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.770\nIf you look down at the bottom\nright of the, kind of,\n\n118\n00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.070\nend of this table,\nyou see this little guy right here,\n\n119\n00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:58.090\njust looks like a little, I don't even\nknow what to call that, a backwards L?\n\n120\n00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.535\nWe'll call it that.\n\n121\n00:05:59.535 --> 00:06:05.800\n[LAUGH] So that just indicates that that\nis the end of the range of this table.\n\n122\n00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.620\nNow this will change, when you have your\nmouse over it, to a two pointed arrow,\n\n123\n00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:16.200\nto where you can change the boundaries\nof what is defining this table.\n\n124\n00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:22.076\nTo exclude or include more information\nthat might be around that.\n\n125\n00:06:22.076 --> 00:06:25.090\nSo I'll zoom back out of there.\n\n126\n00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.300\nLet's go ahead and do this.\n\n127\n00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.360\nLet's come over here to this\nother range of information, and\n\n128\n00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.950\nlet's format this is a table.\n\n129\n00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.720\nSo we can start really\nseeing like the true\n\n130\n00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.990\nnature of these two independent pieces.\n\n131\n00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.770\nSo anywhere within your range of cells,\nyou come up to format as table, and\n\n132\n00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.090\nwe'll just pick, doesn't matter which one,\nI'm just gonna pick this one for now.\n\n133\n00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:51.343\nClick OK, and then it goes ahead and\nformats it, and I love,\n\n134\n00:06:51.343 --> 00:06:56.500\nto me, the thing that I love\nright away are the banded rows.\n\n135\n00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.280\nWhere it goes ahead and changes,\n\n136\n00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.910\nit alternates between fills,\nto where you can see it [INAUDIBLE].\n\n137\n00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:02.777\nI dunno have you've ever done this,\n\n138\n00:07:02.777 --> 00:07:06.110\nDaniel, like if you have something\nprinted out or it's on your screen.\n\n139\n00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.140\nHave you ever had to like\ntake a piece of paper, and\n\n140\n00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:13.920\nactually put it up into\nthe actual row to see across.\n\n141\n00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:14.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n142\n00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.240\nWe're using like a mask or a blinder.\n\n143\n00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.220\nSo I don't see anything\nI don't want to see.\n\n144\n00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.980\nI can focus in what it is\nI'm really looking for.\n\n145\n00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:24.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI've actually taken a piece of paper and\n\n146\n00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.170\nput it up on my monitor like this.\n\n147\n00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:28.620\nCuz I can't actually see.\n\n148\n00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.641\nCuz my eye travels across and\nit goes down one.\n\n149\n00:07:31.641 --> 00:07:35.078\nWhen you have these\nalternating bands here,\n\n150\n00:07:35.078 --> 00:07:38.067\nI know Jack Bow tie keep in that orange.\n\n151\n00:07:38.067 --> 00:07:42.410\nIf I go down in the white, well,\nthat's the next record down there.\n\n152\n00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:46.228\nAnd to be able to do this like without\na table, you'd just sit there and\n\n153\n00:07:46.228 --> 00:07:49.160\nselect every other row and\njust change the fill.\n\n154\n00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.018\n&gt;&gt; That sounds fun.\n\n155\n00:07:50.018 --> 00:07:50.856\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, it's not.\n\n156\n00:07:50.856 --> 00:07:52.485\n[LAUGH] It's not at all.\n\n157\n00:07:52.485 --> 00:07:55.873\nSo you want to go ahead and\nif you format as a table,\n\n158\n00:07:55.873 --> 00:08:01.146\nyou can quickly add that particular style,\nwhich is pretty fun right there.\n\n159\n00:08:01.146 --> 00:08:06.415\nNow, since there are two independent\nunits Wanted to show you what happens.\n\n160\n00:08:06.415 --> 00:08:10.945\nIf I try to do the same thing I did\nearlier, where if I'm on Row 4, and\n\n161\n00:08:10.945 --> 00:08:16.831\nI right-click on that, and I say, look, it\ndoesn't even give me the option to insert.\n\n162\n00:08:16.831 --> 00:08:18.580\nIt's like, hm, why?\n\n163\n00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:21.950\nOkay, well there's something\nthat's it's not gonna let me do,\n\n164\n00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:23.430\nbecause it's saying that.\n\n165\n00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:27.007\nAnd even if you do get an insert, and\nit tries to tell you to go ahead and\n\n166\n00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:30.977\nput this in it will actually give me\na warning that says no, I can't do this.\n\n167\n00:08:30.977 --> 00:08:34.280\nIt's because you're going\nto mess up the rows.\n\n168\n00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.400\nAnd actually here, let me show you this.\n\n169\n00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.670\nI think it's, there, watch this.\n\n170\n00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:40.167\nIf I say, all right let's insert,\nwell, it did it anyways.\n\n171\n00:08:40.167 --> 00:08:41.557\nOkay, well, okay, you know what?\n\n172\n00:08:41.557 --> 00:08:44.080\nLet's pretend it never happened,\nlet's roll back.\n\n173\n00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.370\nIt should go ahead and give you warning\nthat was like this is going to move\n\n174\n00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:50.730\nsome of the data within your tables.\n\n175\n00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:52.291\nAnd it's gonna shift everything around.\n\n176\n00:08:52.291 --> 00:08:55.320\nSo let's go ahead and\nformat that back as a table.\n\n177\n00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.300\nWe'll just pick whatever one.\n\n178\n00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:57.520\nWe'll click OK.\n\n179\n00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:01.530\nAnd so I cannot add individual rows.\n\n180\n00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:06.140\nSo then how am I supposed to start\nworking within these tables?\n\n181\n00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:09.750\nYou have to go back to the way\nthat you have to do it in Word and\n\n182\n00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.705\nPowerPoint, is you start\nright clicking on everything.\n\n183\n00:09:12.705 --> 00:09:15.630\nCuz notice up here in this contextual tab,\n\n184\n00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:19.248\nit's not gonna have things like\ninsert a row or insert a column.\n\n185\n00:09:19.248 --> 00:09:23.740\nCuz if I wanted to put another row\nin between let's say, Fuego and\n\n186\n00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:27.410\nSimba right here because that's where\nI want to put something, above it or\n\n187\n00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:30.010\nbelow it, you have to think, where am I?\n\n188\n00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:31.840\nSo right now I'm in the Fuego cell.\n\n189\n00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.990\nIf I right click, that's where\nyou're going to get the insert.\n\n190\n00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:39.855\nAnd notice that the insert here is\ntalking about Table Column to the Left or\n\n191\n00:09:39.855 --> 00:09:41.490\nTable Row Above.\n\n192\n00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:44.570\nThe Delete, do you want to delete\nthe column or delete the row.\n\n193\n00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:48.090\nWatch if I right clicked in a cell\nthat is not formatted as a table.\n\n194\n00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:49.330\nI don't get any of those same options.\n\n195\n00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.038\nIt just says Insert...\n\n196\n00:09:51.038 --> 00:09:52.295\nor Delete...\n\n197\n00:09:52.295 --> 00:09:54.610\nAnd that's where you start getting into\nyour worksheets and things like that.\n\n198\n00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:59.990\nSo you see you have completely different\noptions when you're right clicking within\n\n199\n00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.760\na table.\n\n200\n00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:05.839\nAnd that's how you want to start\ncontrolling adding columns, adding or\n\n201\n00:10:05.839 --> 00:10:11.430\ndeleting columns, adding or deleting\nrows in something formatted as a table.\n\n202\n00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:14.170\nSo that's a big thing that\npeople really get confused at.\n\n203\n00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:17.039\nAnd I can't tell you how many\ntimes I've had people be like,\n\n204\n00:10:17.039 --> 00:10:18.285\nI can't insert any rows.\n\n205\n00:10:18.285 --> 00:10:21.057\nAnd I would look at them like,\nthat's cuz it's a table.\n\n206\n00:10:21.057 --> 00:10:23.533\nAnd they're trying to go\nthe way that I was showing you.\n\n207\n00:10:23.533 --> 00:10:27.300\nAnd it's like no, it's a different,\nit's a whole different beast.\n\n208\n00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:31.170\nAnd so you have to know how to tame\nthe beast, and how the beast reacts.\n\n209\n00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:34.249\nAnd so that's why, you need to start\ndoing that right clicking, and\n\n210\n00:10:34.249 --> 00:10:35.429\ndo like Insert Row Above.\n\n211\n00:10:35.429 --> 00:10:37.658\nAnd notice what happen over at this table.\n\n212\n00:10:37.658 --> 00:10:39.650\nDidn't get touched, did it?\n\n213\n00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:41.268\nBecause they're two independent bodies.\n\n214\n00:10:41.268 --> 00:10:45.740\nThey work within their own\nlittle world with each other.\n\n215\n00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.007\nSo that's something that is good to know.\n\n216\n00:10:48.007 --> 00:10:51.940\nI'm gonna scroll over here for\na little bit so we can see this table.\n\n217\n00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.823\nThe other thing that happens,\n\n218\n00:10:53.823 --> 00:10:58.243\nis if you start adding information\naround the boarders of the table, for\n\n219\n00:10:58.243 --> 00:11:02.170\nexample, what if I wanted to throw\nin another column over here?\n\n220\n00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:03.890\nLet's just say a color.\n\n221\n00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:06.364\nAnd watch what happens when I Enter or\nTab.\n\n222\n00:11:06.364 --> 00:11:08.541\nIt goes ahead and says,\nwait, I'm right next to you.\n\n223\n00:11:08.541 --> 00:11:13.250\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and extend how\nmuch of a table's going to happen.\n\n224\n00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:16.670\nThe same thing if I came down here\nbecause maybe we need to add you, Daniel.\n\n225\n00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.270\nSo we'll say Daniel.\n\n226\n00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:18.947\nAnd then I'll hit the Tab.\n\n227\n00:11:18.947 --> 00:11:23.050\nAnd notice that down here it has said,\nwe've got a little bit more.\n\n228\n00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:25.220\nLet me start adding that in there.\n\n229\n00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.770\nAnd so I could go ahead and\nput in your last name.\n\n230\n00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.250\nAnd I'm just gonna pretend\nlike I know what I'm typing.\n\n231\n00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:30.960\nBlah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n232\n00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:36.380\nBut watch what happens when I hit\nTab at the very end of my table.\n\n233\n00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:40.780\nIt automatically made a new\nrow within the table.\n\n234\n00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.130\nAnd then it extended that border.\n\n235\n00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:46.620\nIt didn't keep tabbing over cuz Tab always\njust takes you one cell to the right.\n\n236\n00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.110\nNot in this case when you're\nworking within a table.\n\n237\n00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:50.470\nSame thing if I was right here.\n\n238\n00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:56.340\nIf I was on this cell, I5,\nthis Marketing and I hit Tab, Tab,\n\n239\n00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:02.520\nTab you see how it goes ahead and\ncomes down onto the next row of the table.\n\n240\n00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.336\nIt doesn't keep on going.\n\n241\n00:12:04.336 --> 00:12:08.590\nSo that, all the same things that you\nhave in, we'll say a normal table like in\n\n242\n00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:12.979\nWord and PowerPoint and stuff, you gets\nthe end tab just keeps you going across.\n\n243\n00:12:12.979 --> 00:12:14.902\nNow the Enter still works.\n\n244\n00:12:14.902 --> 00:12:18.110\nThat keeps you down instead\nof something different.\n\n245\n00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:22.920\nBut just knowing how those\nthings work within a table.\n\n246\n00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:27.480\nSweet, so now we understand what's\ngoing on here with our structure.\n\n247\n00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.800\nI guess one more thing before I move on\nto the total row, which is super cool.\n\n248\n00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.918\nIf you needed to extend or\ncontract the amount of space,\n\n249\n00:12:34.918 --> 00:12:39.034\nif you want to say,\nthe defining borders of this table,\n\n250\n00:12:39.034 --> 00:12:44.026\nmaybe I don't want the column color\nto be included into this table,\n\n251\n00:12:44.026 --> 00:12:49.745\njust don't treat it as that, you can\ntake that two pointed arrow right here.\n\n252\n00:12:49.745 --> 00:12:52.989\nAnd you can tell it to say nope,\ndon't do the color.\n\n253\n00:12:52.989 --> 00:12:55.140\nAnd you know what Daniel,\nI'm sorry, honey.\n\n254\n00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:59.140\nYou're gonna have to be cut out of this so\nI can click, hold and drag up.\n\n255\n00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:00.980\nSo you are not part of the group.\n\n256\n00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.850\nYou're not part of the table.\n\n257\n00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:04.520\nYou're out in no man's land.\n\n258\n00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:06.001\n&gt;&gt; I'm unique, thank you.\n\n259\n00:13:06.001 --> 00:13:10.197\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm glad your\nmom has told you that.\n\n260\n00:13:10.197 --> 00:13:12.650\n[LAUGH] So we have that going on here.\n\n261\n00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:14.205\nAnd then it's like hey, you know what?\n\n262\n00:13:14.205 --> 00:13:16.649\nWe've decided you can\ncome back into the fold.\n\n263\n00:13:16.649 --> 00:13:17.945\n&gt;&gt; Who says I want to?\n\n264\n00:13:17.945 --> 00:13:20.495\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I defy you.\n\n265\n00:13:20.495 --> 00:13:24.360\n[LAUGH] So now you can see\nthat we've included you back.\n\n266\n00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.202\nWe're forcing you, we have no choice.\n\n267\n00:13:27.202 --> 00:13:29.425\nAnd then we can move over and\ninclude that.\n\n268\n00:13:29.425 --> 00:13:34.932\nSo you can manually adjust those\nborders of or defining boundaries\n\n269\n00:13:34.932 --> 00:13:40.534\nof that table by moving that bottom\nright hand corner to include or,\n\n270\n00:13:40.534 --> 00:13:45.380\nI almost said disclude,\nexclude, the area of your data.\n\n271\n00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:49.342\nTable rows, I love me a total row.\n\n272\n00:13:49.342 --> 00:13:50.920\nWe have some information right here.\n\n273\n00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.730\nLet's go ahead and format as a table.\n\n274\n00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:53.930\nSo quick and easy.\n\n275\n00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:56.690\nWe'll go over here and say,\nlet's go with this one.\n\n276\n00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:58.740\nAnd we'll click OK and there we go.\n\n277\n00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.450\nWe have our columns, we have our rows.\n\n278\n00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:05.678\nWe have our autofills or auto,\nnot autofills, I'm sorry auto filters,\n\n279\n00:14:05.678 --> 00:14:08.678\nthat come on here to where we can\nstart sorting and things like that.\n\n280\n00:14:08.678 --> 00:14:11.370\nLet's concentrate on some\nof these options up here.\n\n281\n00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:13.490\nAnd then, you know what,\nmaybe I don't like the blue.\n\n282\n00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:14.935\nWhat if I want it to be green?\n\n283\n00:14:14.935 --> 00:14:16.208\nWhat if I want it to be pink?\n\n284\n00:14:16.208 --> 00:14:19.480\nOoh, so we can come down here\ninto the different ways.\n\n285\n00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:23.990\nAnd you can see like do you want\nyour top row to be darker or\n\n286\n00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:25.382\ndo you want it to be lighter.\n\n287\n00:14:25.382 --> 00:14:28.730\nNotice that once you've put on a style\nwhen you hover over it you get that\n\n288\n00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:30.190\nlive preview.\n\n289\n00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:35.040\nSo you can see do you want more of\na contrast between your banded rows.\n\n290\n00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:39.690\nPretty much what the icon looks like is\nwhat the table's going to be formatted as.\n\n291\n00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:42.150\nNow where are all these\ncolors coming from?\n\n292\n00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:44.880\nThese colors are coming from your theme.\n\n293\n00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:48.166\nSo whatever theme you have on\nyour worksheet or workbook,\n\n294\n00:14:48.166 --> 00:14:50.690\nthat's what it's gonna pull from.\n\n295\n00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:54.630\nFor example, if I came over here\nto Page Layout, changed my theme.\n\n296\n00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:58.592\nAnd of course we know that themes will\nchange the overall color font and\n\n297\n00:14:58.592 --> 00:15:01.358\neffects that happen\nthroughout your workbook.\n\n298\n00:15:01.358 --> 00:15:06.400\nSo notice if I chose the, we'll go\nwith the Ion Board, there's my pink.\n\n299\n00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.450\nCome back over to the Design tab.\n\n300\n00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:13.020\nAnd notice now we've got, there we go,\nsome pinks and some purples and\n\n301\n00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.080\nsome yellows and things like that.\n\n302\n00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.076\nSo we can go ahead and change that.\n\n303\n00:15:16.076 --> 00:15:19.690\nSo that's where those\ncolors are coming from.\n\n304\n00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:24.900\nNow I like this one cuz I do\nlike the kind of lighter and\n\n305\n00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:28.860\ndarker, like the white and\nthen whatever color for those banded rows.\n\n306\n00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:31.050\nBut maybe I don't want\nit to be banded rows.\n\n307\n00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:32.280\nAnd then they have these\nlittle check boxes.\n\n308\n00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.650\nWhoops, I moved my mouse over.\n\n309\n00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:38.200\nYou have these check boxes up at the top\nto where, do I want them to be banded?\n\n310\n00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.660\nMaybe I can uncheck that.\n\n311\n00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:42.110\nAnd then notice that it\ndoesn't band the rows.\n\n312\n00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:44.900\nCuz maybe you need to\nband the columns instead.\n\n313\n00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:47.380\nSo let's band the columns, turn that off.\n\n314\n00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:51.354\nNow doing banded columns and banded rows,\nthat doesn't really work as well.\n\n315\n00:15:51.354 --> 00:15:53.692\nThat starts to get really kinda confusing.\n\n316\n00:15:53.692 --> 00:15:55.818\nIt's like I don't really know\nwhat I'm looking at right now.\n\n317\n00:15:55.818 --> 00:15:58.406\nSo I would pretty much choose one or\nthe other.\n\n318\n00:15:58.406 --> 00:16:01.292\nNow this last column and first column.\n\n319\n00:16:01.292 --> 00:16:05.422\nAll that does is it's going to put\non a specific format depending on\n\n320\n00:16:05.422 --> 00:16:07.250\nwhat the style looks like.\n\n321\n00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:11.320\nNotice how if I check on the first column,\nall in this one does, it goes ahead and\n\n322\n00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.370\nbolds it.\n\n323\n00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:14.720\nIf I had come over to say one of these,\n\n324\n00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.530\nand now look at what\nthe thumbnails look like.\n\n325\n00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:22.382\nIt's showing me what it's gonna look\nlike if I have that first column\n\n326\n00:16:22.382 --> 00:16:23.813\noption checked on.\n\n327\n00:16:23.813 --> 00:16:27.106\nIf I check on that last column and\nthen drop this down,\n\n328\n00:16:27.106 --> 00:16:31.495\nyou can see in this particular style\nit's actually going to go ahead and\n\n329\n00:16:31.495 --> 00:16:35.040\nfill in the cells rather\nthan just make it bold.\n\n330\n00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.567\nSo it makes it a little\ndifferent depending on\n\n331\n00:16:37.567 --> 00:16:39.966\nwhich style that you're going to choose.\n\n332\n00:16:39.966 --> 00:16:42.200\nAll right, so let me turn those off.\n\n333\n00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.190\nWe know what that does.\n\n334\n00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:48.020\nBut our total row, our total row\ndoes something completely different,\n\n335\n00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.466\nin the sense that it does\ndo the formatting, so\n\n336\n00:16:50.466 --> 00:16:53.250\nyou can see that it went ahead and\nmade all the fills.\n\n337\n00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:58.401\nBut there's another cool little feature\nthat happens in a total row in a table.\n\n338\n00:16:58.401 --> 00:17:02.299\nYou get what are known\nas subtotal functions.\n\n339\n00:17:02.299 --> 00:17:06.995\nNow, we've talked about this before, we're\nnot doing functions in this particular\n\n340\n00:17:06.995 --> 00:17:11.303\nepisode or this whole series really, but\nyou really don't even need to know how\n\n341\n00:17:11.303 --> 00:17:15.278\nto write it to be able to apply this,\nand this is where it's pretty cool.\n\n342\n00:17:15.278 --> 00:17:21.020\nSo notice that here in the bottom of the\ncalls it added 590, well, what is that?\n\n343\n00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.640\nIt's looks like it's doing what?\n\n344\n00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.050\nIt's adding all those calls up, isn't it?\n\n345\n00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:28.782\nSo we're seeing that, well I've had 590\ntotal calls, how did it know to do that?\n\n346\n00:17:28.782 --> 00:17:33.650\nNow it's automatically gonna\nadd a specific subtotal\n\n347\n00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:37.260\nat the last column of your information.\n\n348\n00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:38.822\nIt might just be a count, a whatnot.\n\n349\n00:17:38.822 --> 00:17:42.779\n&gt;&gt; So you don't have to make a total row,\nper se, it just does it.\n\n350\n00:17:42.779 --> 00:17:44.300\n&gt;&gt; All you gotta do is check it on.\n\n351\n00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:48.810\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and then it it will go ahead and\nsay, hey, here is this.\n\n352\n00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:54.569\nNow look at what the, I clicked on\nthe cell, it says subtotal 109 calls.\n\n353\n00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:58.523\nAgain, you can just go, sounds good.\n\n354\n00:17:58.523 --> 00:18:00.114\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Move on.\n\n355\n00:18:00.114 --> 00:18:01.868\n[LAUGH] But what this is,\n\n356\n00:18:01.868 --> 00:18:05.375\na subtotal is a specific\nfunction in Excel, and\n\n357\n00:18:05.375 --> 00:18:11.000\nthat 109 is a reference.\nIt's a reference to adding everything\n\n358\n00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.290\nup and in what column, we are in\nthe calls column within this table.\n\n359\n00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:19.280\nWatch if I move this down and\nI drop this down.\n\n360\n00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:22.507\nCuz these are things that we all,\nlike I said, those basic ones, okay.\n\n361\n00:18:22.507 --> 00:18:26.690\nSum is gonna add things up, count is\ngonna count it, average is gonna average.\n\n362\n00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:31.588\nWatch if I chose average, you see how\nthat number right there, it was 109 and\n\n363\n00:18:31.588 --> 00:18:32.766\nnow it's 101.\n\n364\n00:18:32.766 --> 00:18:37.320\nSo, that is just a reference within\nExcel to know that 101 equals average,\n\n365\n00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.570\n109 equal sum.\n\n366\n00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:40.976\nThere's 103 means something else.\n\n367\n00:18:40.976 --> 00:18:45.550\n[LAUGH] So it's just gonna go ahead and\nperform those basic functions.\n\n368\n00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:49.031\nI mean, look at how cool this is,\nhow simple.\n\n369\n00:18:49.031 --> 00:18:51.350\nI can just, oops, sorry,\nthat went a little too far.\n\n370\n00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:53.860\nI can just go ahead and\nthrow this in as a table.\n\n371\n00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:57.738\nMaybe I want to say what's\nthe average sales right here.\n\n372\n00:18:57.738 --> 00:19:02.174\nJust click on that total row,\ndrop that down, and then choose average.\n\n373\n00:19:02.174 --> 00:19:06.494\nHere let me zoom back out this way and\nthen zoom back in this way, sorry,\n\n374\n00:19:06.494 --> 00:19:07.299\nthere we go.\n\n375\n00:19:07.299 --> 00:19:10.040\nOkay, so that's super super easy.\n\n376\n00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.956\nIn the forms, let's go ahead and\ncount this up and\n\n377\n00:19:12.956 --> 00:19:15.671\nsee how many people have\nfilled out this form.\n\n378\n00:19:15.671 --> 00:19:18.826\nI think we're calling this an HR form or\nsomething like that.\n\n379\n00:19:18.826 --> 00:19:20.270\nThat's what I've decided\nthat they're going to be.\n\n380\n00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:22.930\nSo now I've got this and you're like, wow,\n\n381\n00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:25.980\nthat's super cool that I could\ngo ahead and perform this.\n\n382\n00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:27.570\nNow this is where the real power comes in.\n\n383\n00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:32.217\nThis is adding up all of the sales and\nthe calls or\n\n384\n00:19:32.217 --> 00:19:34.770\nI think we did an average on these.\n\n385\n00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:37.455\nBut watch what happens when I filter this.\n\n386\n00:19:37.455 --> 00:19:39.280\nOoh, if I say well, you know what?\n\n387\n00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.560\nNow what I'd like to do\nis turn off everything.\n\n388\n00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.390\nI just wanna see what\nthe advertising department does.\n\n389\n00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:50.280\nAnd if I choose Advertising and\nclick OK, my goodness, look at that.\n\n390\n00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:54.873\nIn the Advertising,\nit's gonna automatically update all of\n\n391\n00:19:54.873 --> 00:19:58.380\nthose subtotals based on your filtering.\n\n392\n00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:01.130\nCool.\nSo I can see that in Advertising I've\n\n393\n00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:03.030\nonly had one person fill out the form.\n\n394\n00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:07.118\nWe have our average of $360 ish and\n\n395\n00:20:07.118 --> 00:20:10.835\nthen we have a total of 71 calls.\n\n396\n00:20:10.835 --> 00:20:12.024\nWell, then let's go ahead and change that.\n\n397\n00:20:12.024 --> 00:20:14.590\nLet's say, well, how many does\nthe marketing department have?\n\n398\n00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:17.560\nAnd that's where you can really see\n\n399\n00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.820\nthe power of using these\nsub-totals within your tables.\n\n400\n00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:23.170\nCuz you can go ahead and filter them out.\n\n401\n00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:24.290\nLove that.\n\n402\n00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:28.200\nAnd then you can keep on going if\nyou kept doing all those filters and\n\n403\n00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:31.300\nit's going to update all of your formulas.\n\n404\n00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.885\nSo, loving it, go ahead and\nclear that out.\n\n405\n00:20:33.885 --> 00:20:37.665\nNow there's a few other things within our\ntables that we should know, especially\n\n406\n00:20:37.665 --> 00:20:41.357\nwhen you start adding these subtotals\nis you've got these cool little things.\n\n407\n00:20:41.357 --> 00:20:43.700\nThey're called slicers.\n\n408\n00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:47.000\nNow it says a slice is used\nto filter data visually.\n\n409\n00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.560\nThis is where you just start\nadding buttons, watch.\n\n410\n00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:56.510\nIf I choose insert slicer, I want to\nturn on the department and the form.\n\n411\n00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:57.360\nJust keep going with me.\n\n412\n00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:01.470\nAnd if I click OK, what they've added\nare these little boxes over here.\n\n413\n00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:05.790\nSo if I move these over, what I can do,\nis it's a quick way for me to say,\n\n414\n00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:09.182\nall right you know what,\nthis is everybody that's on.\n\n415\n00:21:09.182 --> 00:21:14.130\nLet's turn off the Sales and Marketing,\nand then, let me just see Marketing.\n\n416\n00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:15.540\nLet me just see Developer.\n\n417\n00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.548\nLet me go ahead and turn on the\nAdvertising so I can use these buttons.\n\n418\n00:21:18.548 --> 00:21:21.802\nAnd then from Advertising\nhow many of them are blank.\n\n419\n00:21:21.802 --> 00:21:23.690\nOr how many have an x?\n\n420\n00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:24.930\nSo that's what these slicers are for,\n\n421\n00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:29.270\nthey're just really quick little,\nwell, buttons, I guess you could say.\n\n422\n00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:31.450\nRather than using the filters and\ndropping them down,\n\n423\n00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:37.260\nI could use these to go ahead and\nput where I want them to filter out.\n\n424\n00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:40.070\nSo, loving that, I love slicers.\n\n425\n00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:42.540\nNormally you see slicers\nwith pivot tables, but\n\n426\n00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:46.610\nthey've expanded that out into\nbeing able to filter things out\n\n427\n00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:50.640\nvisually in this kind of button\nform looking thing with our tables.\n\n428\n00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.557\nAnd then if you don't like what's\ngoing on there, you can go ahead and\n\n429\n00:21:53.557 --> 00:21:55.499\nclear the filters,\nclear the filters there.\n\n430\n00:21:55.499 --> 00:22:00.600\nSo it's just like a shortcut, if you wanna\nsay, from using the buttons up here.\n\n431\n00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.530\nAnd then if I don't like this,\nI can just go ahead and just delete it.\n\n432\n00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:05.550\nAnd it's not gonna change\nanything in my information.\n\n433\n00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:08.584\nI'm just deleting those controls,\nif you wanna say.\n\n434\n00:22:08.584 --> 00:22:12.977\nAll right, so the next thing I\nwant to talk about, duplicates.\n\n435\n00:22:12.977 --> 00:22:17.370\nSo a few things here,\nI love me some remove duplicates.\n\n436\n00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:20.762\nSo if I have this, let's first\nformat it as a table, throw it onto,\n\n437\n00:22:20.762 --> 00:22:22.620\nwe'll just throw this one in there.\n\n438\n00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:27.880\nAnd I have this sorted by last name,\njust to make sure.\n\n439\n00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.240\nSo you can see like, right here.\n\n440\n00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:33.480\nSasha Cat, I have three repeats in here.\n\n441\n00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:36.352\nAnd I think another one I have down here.\n\n442\n00:22:36.352 --> 00:22:37.113\nHere we go.\n\n443\n00:22:37.113 --> 00:22:38.511\nWe have a Paul West.\n\n444\n00:22:38.511 --> 00:22:42.006\nPaul West, [LAUGH] that's funny,\nthat's a human name.\n\n445\n00:22:42.006 --> 00:22:44.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's a ridiculous name for\n\n446\n00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:45.520\na cat.\n\n447\n00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.115\n&gt;&gt; But you have a cat named Paul West,\ndon't you?\n\n448\n00:22:47.115 --> 00:22:51.479\n&gt;&gt; No, but [LAUGH] but\nthe people in Quahog do so\n\n449\n00:22:51.479 --> 00:22:55.401\nit's a inside reference that I love.\n\n450\n00:22:55.401 --> 00:22:56.949\n[LAUGH] But\n\n451\n00:22:56.949 --> 00:23:01.270\nI wanna go ahead and make it to where\nI don't want any duplicates in here.\n\n452\n00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:03.890\nNow what you have to think about\nwhen you're removing duplicates\n\n453\n00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:08.860\nis what is that criteria for\nwhat it needs to be the duplicate.\n\n454\n00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:12.040\nAll the way across,\njust in the first and last name column.\n\n455\n00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:15.083\nSo what does it need to analyze\nto say all right, well,\n\n456\n00:23:15.083 --> 00:23:19.730\nlet me check each one of these columns and\nif it has a duplicate I'm gonna remove it.\n\n457\n00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:23.100\nSo in this case it needs\nto be all the way across.\n\n458\n00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:26.700\nSo what you can do is up here in\nthe top in your tools within your\n\n459\n00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:32.070\nDesign Contextual tab,\nyou have Remove Duplicates, cool.\n\n460\n00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:36.720\nClick it, and now you can see,\ntell me what columns that you need to see\n\n461\n00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.380\nthat I need to look for the duplicates.\n\n462\n00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:43.550\nAnd it is checked off on all of them,\nwhich in this example I want,\n\n463\n00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:44.990\nso we click OK.\n\n464\n00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:51.100\nAnd that easy, it says, hey, I found\nfour duplicate values and removed them,\n\n465\n00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.820\nI have 22 unique values.\n\n466\n00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:56.046\nFantastic, okay?\n\n467\n00:23:56.046 --> 00:24:00.386\nI can see many different ways\nwhy you want To do that and\n\n468\n00:24:00.386 --> 00:24:05.498\nI have one more just to show you\nthat this was something that I had\n\n469\n00:24:05.498 --> 00:24:10.830\nto do all the time back in my former\njob to where we had students.\n\n470\n00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:13.560\nSo we have many different classes, right?\n\n471\n00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:17.665\nAnd you could have one student\nenrolled in three classes or\n\n472\n00:24:17.665 --> 00:24:21.202\nyou could have one student\nenrolled in one class.\n\n473\n00:24:21.202 --> 00:24:22.361\n&gt;&gt; Three times [LAUGH].\n\n474\n00:24:22.361 --> 00:24:26.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, but\neverybody's taking a unique class.\n\n475\n00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:30.020\nYou can't take introduction to marketing,\ntwice in a semester,\n\n476\n00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:32.052\ncuz it just doesn't work that way.\n\n477\n00:24:32.052 --> 00:24:33.833\nOkay, there's only one intro to marketing.\n\n478\n00:24:33.833 --> 00:24:37.410\nDifferent sections,\nwe're not talking about that, okay.\n\n479\n00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:42.488\nSo if I wanted to check my enrollment\nnumbers, how many enrollments do I have?\n\n480\n00:24:42.488 --> 00:24:45.620\nThen in this sense, and\nI'll throw a total row on there, and\n\n481\n00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:48.580\nlook at that, super easy,\nI just counted, I have 26.\n\n482\n00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:49.830\nSo that's how many people, but\n\n483\n00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:53.540\nthen how many students do I\nhave enrolled in the program?\n\n484\n00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:56.870\nThat's different cuz Mocha\nis taking two classes and\n\n485\n00:24:56.870 --> 00:25:00.794\nSasha is taking three classes,\nbut Sasha's only one person.\n\n486\n00:25:00.794 --> 00:25:03.877\nSo I don't wanna count 26 cuz that's\nnot an accurate representation of\n\n487\n00:25:03.877 --> 00:25:05.820\nhow many students are in the program.\n\n488\n00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:06.605\n&gt;&gt; The plot thickens.\n\n489\n00:25:06.605 --> 00:25:10.120\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, so if I had a list right here.\n\n490\n00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:16.060\nIt's what I would want to find\nthe duplicate would be in the first and\n\n491\n00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:17.560\nlast but not the course.\n\n492\n00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.420\nCuz remember,\nSasha Cat taking the introduction to sales\n\n493\n00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:24.820\nclass wouldn't only be ever once,\ncuz that's the only instance.\n\n494\n00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:30.331\nBut Sasha Cat as a unique person, whoops,\nlet me go ahead, I know thank you.\n\n495\n00:25:30.331 --> 00:25:35.770\nI could say remove duplicates in the first\nand last but not the course column.\n\n496\n00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:40.200\nSo clicking in here, go to remove,\nturn off the course, okay?\n\n497\n00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:43.980\nSo has to be first and last, click OK.\n\n498\n00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:46.687\nI've removed 11 duplicates.\n\n499\n00:25:46.687 --> 00:25:50.138\nI have 15 that unique values remain.\n\n500\n00:25:50.138 --> 00:25:53.093\nThat's how many students I\nhave enrolled in the program.\n\n501\n00:25:53.093 --> 00:25:57.609\nThat is unique values,\njust like you Daniel, aren't you unique?\n\n502\n00:25:57.609 --> 00:25:58.385\n&gt;&gt; I am thank you.\n\n503\n00:25:58.385 --> 00:25:58.990\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n504\n00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:02.090\n&gt;&gt; I'm glad you recognized that\nin me I really appreciate it.\n\n505\n00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:03.670\n&gt;&gt; We can only count you once.\n\n506\n00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:06.545\nThere's no other Daniel Lowrie, right?\n\n507\n00:26:06.545 --> 00:26:07.523\n&gt;&gt; I have yet to find one.\n\n508\n00:26:07.523 --> 00:26:10.675\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So that's where we have\nthe remove duplicates that could be\n\n509\n00:26:10.675 --> 00:26:11.427\nreally handy.\n\n510\n00:26:11.427 --> 00:26:17.680\nI have 15 students, but 26 enrollments,\nlove the remove duplicates.\n\n511\n00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:20.090\nLast thing that I want to cover,\nI know I'm stretching this a little\n\n512\n00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:24.060\nfurther than normal, just because\nI wanna complete this thought, and\n\n513\n00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:25.640\ntell you all the cool things about tables.\n\n514\n00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:29.930\nHopefully so far you're like, this is\namazing, cuz I think it's pretty amazing.\n\n515\n00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:32.730\nHaving to convert it back to a range.\n\n516\n00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:34.174\nCuz we like to format it as a table.\n\n517\n00:26:34.174 --> 00:26:35.856\nI pretty much format\neverything as a table.\n\n518\n00:26:35.856 --> 00:26:38.750\nCuz there's so\nmany different things I could do.\n\n519\n00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:42.770\nBut here sometimes I need\nto have it as a range.\n\n520\n00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:45.873\nOne of them, do you remember when\nwe did subtotals, remember we did?\n\n521\n00:26:45.873 --> 00:26:46.497\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n522\n00:26:46.497 --> 00:26:50.620\nwell you can't put subtotals in a table.\n\n523\n00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:52.830\nIt just won't happen,\nit will not allow you to do that.\n\n524\n00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.167\nSo what I could do is\nconvert this into a range.\n\n525\n00:26:57.167 --> 00:27:00.510\nWhat that means convert it back\ninto a normal range of cells.\n\n526\n00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:04.510\nEverything's still there, it's just I\nwant you to stop acting like a table.\n\n527\n00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:07.002\nGo back to regular Excel land and\neverything will be fine.\n\n528\n00:27:07.002 --> 00:27:11.333\n&gt;&gt; So you do your funky doo-hickey stuff\nwith table stuff which is awesome.\n\n529\n00:27:11.333 --> 00:27:14.714\nAnd then when you get done, you're like\nwell I know you're not gonna be able to do\n\n530\n00:27:14.714 --> 00:27:16.800\nthis so\nalakazam you're not a table anymore.\n\n531\n00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:19.730\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yeah, that's exactly\nwhat it is and it's that simple.\n\n532\n00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:22.382\nYou click this button,\nas long as I'm in the table.\n\n533\n00:27:22.382 --> 00:27:25.034\nI go ahead and convert to range,\ndo you want to convert, you say yes, and\n\n534\n00:27:25.034 --> 00:27:26.442\nyou're like there it is, okay?\n\n535\n00:27:26.442 --> 00:27:28.458\n&gt;&gt; You Alchemist you.\n\n536\n00:27:28.458 --> 00:27:31.125\n&gt;&gt; Now one thing to notice though look\nat all the colors that's still in there.\n\n537\n00:27:31.125 --> 00:27:32.555\n&gt;&gt; The color's still there, yeah.\n\n538\n00:27:32.555 --> 00:27:37.025\n&gt;&gt; So if I came into here and\nthen did a sort on this now, well,\n\n539\n00:27:37.025 --> 00:27:41.183\nthank you, there's a circular reference.\n\n540\n00:27:41.183 --> 00:27:45.744\nCuz it's doing this subtotal it's\nstill remembering that formula.\n\n541\n00:27:45.744 --> 00:27:50.670\nOkay, so this is even more of\nan example of where I was going.\n\n542\n00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:52.989\nLike, hey,\nI might need to turn the totals off.\n\n543\n00:27:52.989 --> 00:27:55.203\nAnd the other thing in here\nlet me just go ahead and\n\n544\n00:27:55.203 --> 00:27:57.039\ndelete this row cuz now we can delete it.\n\n545\n00:27:57.039 --> 00:27:59.025\nOkay, so\nnow let me go back to the sorting and\n\n546\n00:27:59.025 --> 00:28:01.080\nfiltering because I\nwanted to show you this.\n\n547\n00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:05.264\nNow look at all the banded rows are all\ndifferent cuz it doesn't see it as\n\n548\n00:28:05.264 --> 00:28:06.602\nan independent body.\n\n549\n00:28:06.602 --> 00:28:08.220\nSo it's not gonna change all the coloring.\n\n550\n00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:09.930\nSo now everything is thrown off.\n\n551\n00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:13.580\nNow, yeah, of course, you can go ahead and\ncome into control a and\n\n552\n00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:16.120\nthen clear the formats, but\nif you had number formattings and\n\n553\n00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:18.420\nall that kind of stuff,\nyou don't wanna mess with that.\n\n554\n00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:22.386\nSo one thing to do, let's come back\nover here to say like this one,\n\n555\n00:28:22.386 --> 00:28:26.180\nbefore you convert it to a range do this.\n\n556\n00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:31.369\nCome into your design, choose the style\nat the very top where it's just none.\n\n557\n00:28:31.369 --> 00:28:35.073\nTo where there's no banded columns,\nthere's no fills, there's no borders or\n\n558\n00:28:35.073 --> 00:28:36.030\nanything.\n\n559\n00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:43.319\nYou choose this to none, then convert to\na range, now it's just regular Excel.\n\n560\n00:28:43.319 --> 00:28:46.932\nBy the way, in this particular one,\nremember your favorite thing you liked,\n\n561\n00:28:46.932 --> 00:28:47.948\nthat freeze?\n\n562\n00:28:47.948 --> 00:28:49.515\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, super sweet.\n\n563\n00:28:49.515 --> 00:28:51.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's not part of the table.\n\n564\n00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:54.120\nThat's something that I did\nseparately within this worksheet.\n\n565\n00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:55.454\nAnd I think it's on\nthe other worksheet as well.\n\n566\n00:28:55.454 --> 00:29:00.020\nSo that's my biggest tip on\nconverting from a table to a range.\n\n567\n00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:02.913\nGo ahead and put it into that none style.\n\n568\n00:29:02.913 --> 00:29:05.690\nThen go ahead and\nput it back into normal land.\n\n569\n00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:07.784\nAnd then you will be on your way.\n\n570\n00:29:07.784 --> 00:29:13.563\nSo again, this is one of my favorite\nthings, and I will not sing this episode,\n\n571\n00:29:13.563 --> 00:29:17.870\nand get myself really confused,\nbut yes this is awesome.\n\n572\n00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:20.820\nTables are fantastic and\nI hope you enjoy them as much as I do.\n\n573\n00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:21.661\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, very cool stuff.\n\n574\n00:29:21.661 --> 00:29:24.985\nWe've got a lot of power inside of them\nand if you can't see it because she's off\n\n575\n00:29:24.985 --> 00:29:27.773\ncamera now but she's actually\nbiting her hand so she won't sing.\n\n576\n00:29:27.773 --> 00:29:29.546\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS]\n&gt;&gt; It's very hard her not to do that.\n\n577\n00:29:29.546 --> 00:29:31.123\n&gt;&gt; It's troubling for you all.\n\n578\n00:29:31.123 --> 00:29:34.128\n&gt;&gt; That's right it is, well, Vonne thanks\nso much for explaining tables for us.\n\n579\n00:29:34.128 --> 00:29:35.752\nNow, we can start using them for\nourselves.\n\n580\n00:29:35.752 --> 00:29:38.542\nWe do thank you good folks out there for\nwatching, but and\n\n581\n00:29:38.542 --> 00:29:40.765\nguess what it's that time for\nus to sign off.\n\n582\n00:29:40.765 --> 00:29:43.015\nFor OfficeProTV I've been\nyour host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n583\n00:29:43.015 --> 00:29:43.865\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n584\n00:29:43.865 --> 00:29:44.949\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you

00:00:16.732\nhelping you learn where ever you go.\n\n4\n00:00:16.732 --> 00:00:20.427\nI'm zack Memos and\nwe're looking at Excel 2016 Advanced.\n\n5\n00:00:20.427 --> 00:00:22.970\nThis episode, Data Tables.\n\n6\n00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.040\nData tables?\n\n7\n00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.950\nData tables?\n\n8\n00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.320\nThe person to bring us all the information\nwe need is our IT Pro, the one and\n\n9\n00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.160\nonly, Vonne Smith.\n\n10\n00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.530\nVonne, good to see you again.\n\n11\n00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.110\n&gt;&gt; Good to see you too.\n\n12\n00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.244\nYes, data, data, data.\n\n13\n00:00:33.244 --> 00:00:36.039\n&gt;&gt; Data data, duddle-\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] Model and whatever.\n\n14\n00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:36.930\n&gt;&gt; Whatever.\n\n15\n00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.750\n&gt;&gt; And it's funny when we were just\ntalking about this before this show and\n\n16\n00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.985\nI'm like wait,\nI don't even remember the way I say it.\n\n17\n00:00:41.985 --> 00:00:46.270\n[LAUGH] So, but as always we're\ngonna be looking at our data tables.\n\n18\n00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.740\nThis is a specific command within Excel\nthat can do some really cool stuff.\n\n19\n00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.120\nAnd this is part of\nthe What If data analysis.\n\n20\n00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.170\nIt's one of those things like,\nin any business [INAUDIBLE].\n\n21\n00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.240\nWell, if we went ahead and\ncould produce our labor and\n\n22\n00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.280\nthen could increase the amount\nof use that we produce,\n\n23\n00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.120\nwhat would then be the cost\nper item that we do?\n\n24\n00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.370\nI don't know if you\nwatch Shark Tank there.\n\n25\n00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n26\n00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.830\n&gt;&gt; Love that show.\n\n27\n00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:15.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; My gosh.\n\n28\n00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.030\nAnd they're always\n\n29\n00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.010\ntalking about that aren't they?\n\n30\n00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.000\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, right, right.\n\n31\n00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.060\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so what's your cost per unit?\n\n32\n00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.940\nAnd what's your customer acquisition and\nall those different things.\n\n33\n00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:23.720\nAnd they always-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n34\n00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.480\n&gt;&gt; Legal waste or even product waste.\n\n35\n00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.110\nThat sort of that thing.\n\n36\n00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n37\n00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.670\nAnd they just come up\nwith all these numbers.\n\n38\n00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.870\nAnd it's one of those well, if we could\nincrease this, we could get our price.\n\n39\n00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.346\nSo this is something I'm taking\ndirectly from that show [LAUGH].\n\n40\n00:01:35.346 --> 00:01:36.279\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n41\n00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:41.301\n&gt;&gt; Hey, we increase this, we can get\na lower line, or lower price point.\n\n42\n00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:42.097\nAll that fun stuff.\n\n43\n00:01:42.097 --> 00:01:45.615\nSo we're going to be kind of doing\nsome of that within Excel today.\n\n44\n00:01:45.615 --> 00:01:49.845\nSo we're going to go through an make\na data table, and we're going to do a one\n\n45\n00:01:49.845 --> 00:01:54.105\nvariable data table, and we're also\ngonna do a two variable data table.\n\n46\n00:01:54.105 --> 00:01:56.558\nAnd it's pretty simple, and-\n&gt;&gt; A table for two.\n\n47\n00:01:56.558 --> 00:01:59.415\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly,\nwe'll have a table for two,\n\n48\n00:01:59.415 --> 00:02:01.875\ntable for one,\nwhich ever way you wanna go.\n\n49\n00:02:01.875 --> 00:02:04.965\nAnd we're gonna roll with it, so\nwhat I have is I have some examples.\n\n50\n00:02:04.965 --> 00:02:06.950\nSo why don't I go ahead and\njump down in here.\n\n51\n00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.540\nAnd look at some of them.\n\n52\n00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.310\nWe have our example, there we go.\n\n53\n00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.243\nThat's what we're making there,\nour Christmas mouse.\n\n54\n00:02:14.243 --> 00:02:15.600\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I love it.\n\n55\n00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.896\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n56\n00:02:16.896 --> 00:02:19.535\nwhat we have here is just\nlike a cost analysis.\n\n57\n00:02:19.535 --> 00:02:22.815\nYou want to say our Christmas cat and\nmouse and\n\n58\n00:02:22.815 --> 00:02:25.205\nyou can see that if we put our labor.\n\n59\n00:02:25.205 --> 00:02:27.925\nLet's just go ahead and zoom in just\na little bit so I can see this.\n\n60\n00:02:27.925 --> 00:02:32.655\nSo, if we go ahead and calculate\nall of the labor, the materials and\n\n61\n00:02:32.655 --> 00:02:35.355\ntransport then it's about\n$27,000 to go ahead.\n\n62\n00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:41.357\nAnd if we do 10,000 units it would\nbe $2.75 per Christmas mouse.\n\n63\n00:02:41.357 --> 00:02:44.518\nAnd then of course you have\nthe percentage of how much the mark up and\n\n64\n00:02:44.518 --> 00:02:46.790\nwhat's your charge and\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n65\n00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:47.632\nWe're not going that far into it.\n\n66\n00:02:47.632 --> 00:02:54.920\nBut what if we had more units like how\ncan we get that cost per toy down?\n\n67\n00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.450\nWell, I have this little chart if you\nwant to say or table that tells us that's\n\n68\n00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.880\nlike okay well if I changed it,\nI can go ahead and get here.\n\n69\n00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.735\nNow this is an example of a data table and\nI'll show you how to do it in a second.\n\n70\n00:03:07.735 --> 00:03:12.705\nBut it's nice to be able to do something\nlike this, because it's like all right,\n\n71\n00:03:12.705 --> 00:03:16.180\nwell what if I went ahead and\nchanged our transport cost?\n\n72\n00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.013\nWhat if we got that down to $1,000?\n\n73\n00:03:19.013 --> 00:03:21.020\nWell then you can see everything changes.\n\n74\n00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.970\nCuz this is all part of a function,\nand everything.\n\n75\n00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.680\nSo let's actually look at this.\n\n76\n00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.190\nLike right here, the total,\n\n77\n00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.060\nif we look up at the formula bar,\nit's just summing up these numbers.\n\n78\n00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.970\nSo let's take all the materials, labor and\ntransport costs and total it up.\n\n79\n00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.740\nWell, then the cost per toy is just a\nsimple calculation of taking the number of\n\n80\n00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.412\nunits, which is in B10.\n\n81\n00:03:42.412 --> 00:03:46.020\nAnd then divide it by the amount\nof money that we spend on it.\n\n82\n00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.390\nAnd so then you get $2.60 right\nhere when I change these numbers.\n\n83\n00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.070\nSo what I'd like to do,\ninstead of kind of determining well,\n\n84\n00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.450\nwhat if I take my units to ten?\n\n85\n00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.050\nPretend this isn't over here right now.\n\n86\n00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.180\nYou kind of have to change\neach one of these values.\n\n87\n00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.270\nIt's like well, no, why don't you\ngo ahead and do a what-if analysis?\n\n88\n00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.704\nYou go ahead and say, well if all of\nthese are the one variable that I would\n\n89\n00:04:08.704 --> 00:04:12.502\nlike to change well then give me\nwhat would be the result of it.\n\n90\n00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:18.523\nI want to see the cost per toy, what\nis the result of that based on changing\n\n91\n00:04:18.523 --> 00:04:24.870\nthis one variable and this is why\nthis is a one variable data table.\n\n92\n00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.306\nSo you can see that it can be kinda\nfun to kinda play around with that.\n\n93\n00:04:28.306 --> 00:04:32.382\nLike, well, if we get our\nmaterials down to $10,000, wow.\n\n94\n00:04:32.382 --> 00:04:36.478\nIf we had 20,000 units then that\nwould get it down to $1 per toy, and\n\n95\n00:04:36.478 --> 00:04:40.379\nthen we can go ahead and make more\nmoney selling Christmas cat toys, and\n\n96\n00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:41.696\neverything like that.\n\n97\n00:04:41.696 --> 00:04:45.930\nSo again, that Shark Tank kind of\nmentality is going in there for me,\n\n98\n00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.223\ncuz that's where I get all\nof my business knowledge.\n\n99\n00:04:49.223 --> 00:04:52.210\n[LAUGH] So\nwhat if you had another variable?\n\n100\n00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.760\nSo this is something, and actually Zach,\nI was wondering if you've ever seen this.\n\n101\n00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.350\nLike if you've gone shopping and\nyou're like there's all these discounts,\n\n102\n00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:01.389\nsave 20 to 40%.\n\n103\n00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.190\nAnd they actually have\nthose little tables on\n\n104\n00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.420\ntop of the items that tell you like-\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n105\n00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.180\n&gt;&gt; Have you seen this?\n\n106\n00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.790\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n107\n00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.049\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so they'll say here's\nthe price and here's the discount and\n\n108\n00:05:12.049 --> 00:05:15.246\nthen it just tells you like how\nmuch your saving or whatever.\n\n109\n00:05:15.246 --> 00:05:17.352\n&gt;&gt; Price of 3.99 and now it's yeah.\n\n110\n00:05:17.352 --> 00:05:18.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n111\n00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.221\n&gt;&gt; So this is something I've seen all\nthe time, I'm like that's a data table.\n\n112\n00:05:23.221 --> 00:05:24.113\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n113\n00:05:24.113 --> 00:05:24.649\n&gt;&gt; It exactly is.\n\n114\n00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:27.572\nHere's our price, and\nI just put a random number in here.\n\n115\n00:05:27.572 --> 00:05:32.014\nHere's $5,000 and\nthen we have a discount of 10%.\n\n116\n00:05:32.014 --> 00:05:38.092\nWell, this is the result right here\nof 10% of 5,000 would be $500.\n\n117\n00:05:38.092 --> 00:05:40.342\nOkay, so the same thing here.\n\n118\n00:05:40.342 --> 00:05:45.072\nWell, what if I had something that\ncost $25, and I was saving $30?\n\n119\n00:05:45.072 --> 00:05:49.382\nWell, then that would be\nthat I'm saving $7.50.\n\n120\n00:05:49.382 --> 00:05:50.279\nSo that's kind of cool.\n\n121\n00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:52.120\nYou see all of these types of things.\n\n122\n00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.737\nAt least when I go shopping,\nI like to see those charts.\n\n123\n00:05:54.737 --> 00:05:58.600\nAnd I'm like, I got a pink dot,\nthat's 40% of this price.\n\n124\n00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.770\nBoom, I like that.\n\n125\n00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.230\nSo you can see things like that.\n\n126\n00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.890\nSome other examples here of a loan chart.\n\n127\n00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.310\nAnd then this is just another just trying\nto change different variables of like if\n\n128\n00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:13.840\nI have a price and a quantity and\nthen a discount, then how much is that?\n\n129\n00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.560\nSo that's what you have the results of\nhere given my variables go ahead and\n\n130\n00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.760\ngive you the data in a table\nlike format to tell me\n\n131\n00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.410\nwhat the differences would be like in the\ncalculations which could be pretty fun.\n\n132\n00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.206\nSo I'm going to show you how\nyou can actually do this now,\n\n133\n00:06:30.206 --> 00:06:34.168\n[INAUDIBLE] I'd like to show you like the\nend results, give you like an example and\n\n134\n00:06:34.168 --> 00:06:36.285\nthen we're going to go ahead and build it.\n\n135\n00:06:36.285 --> 00:06:40.931\nSo, why don't we jump on\nover to my other file.\n\n136\n00:06:40.931 --> 00:06:45.440\nAnd so we've got our start here of\nour Christmas cat and mouse toys.\n\n137\n00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.260\nWe've got our numbers.\n\n138\n00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.680\nWe've got our formulas still in here,\nso that's all been done.\n\n139\n00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.660\nSince we're not really concentrating\non how to create the formulas within\n\n140\n00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.020\nthis episode, it's more of just\nhow do I make that data table?\n\n141\n00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.710\nYou're gonna have to kind\nof look at what you need to\n\n142\n00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:04.470\nchange within your particular files\nto kind of get this scenario.\n\n143\n00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:07.078\nAnd this is, again,\none of that to [INAUDIBLE] it's own and\n\n144\n00:07:07.078 --> 00:07:09.648\nyou might not ever really need\nto do something like this.\n\n145\n00:07:09.648 --> 00:07:11.116\nBut a lot of thinking and\n\n146\n00:07:11.116 --> 00:07:15.900\nforecasting of this what if analysis can\nbe really handy to do this function.\n\n147\n00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.040\nSo I've got them all here.\n\n148\n00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:22.070\nWhat we've got here is I've just\nput a number here arbitrarily.\n\n149\n00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.914\nTo say this is going to\nbe the number of units.\n\n150\n00:07:23.914 --> 00:07:28.521\nBecause I want to see when I change the\nnumber of units how's it's going to change\n\n151\n00:07:28.521 --> 00:07:30.800\nthis particular value.\n\n152\n00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:36.118\nSo you do need to organize this\ntable within a table-like format and\n\n153\n00:07:36.118 --> 00:07:39.863\nessentially you have to have rows and\ncolumns.\n\n154\n00:07:39.863 --> 00:07:44.000\nI just highlighted or I putting a box\naround this cell to remind myself where I\n\n155\n00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.710\nwant to pull this particular number.\n\n156\n00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:50.228\nSo how we're going to do that, is we're\njust going to do equals, cuz everything\n\n157\n00:07:50.228 --> 00:07:53.624\nthat starts with a formula or a function\nalways starts off with an equal sign.\n\n158\n00:07:53.624 --> 00:07:57.735\nAnd since we're not writing a calculation,\nwe're basically saying I want this cell.\n\n159\n00:07:57.735 --> 00:08:02.262\nSo start with an equals,\nhit this cell To equal that.\n\n160\n00:08:02.262 --> 00:08:07.500\nSo F5 will really actually\nequal whatever's in B12.\n\n161\n00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:11.720\nI'm pulling that final calculation out,\nand if I hit Enter, there it is.\n\n162\n00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.773\nIt's just 2.75.\n\n163\n00:08:12.773 --> 00:08:17.750\nThis is just one of those things I\ncould just manually type in, 2.75, and\n\n164\n00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:22.520\nformat it as a dollar sign, as currency,\nI could’ve totally done that.\n\n165\n00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.906\nThere's nothing wrong with it.\n\n166\n00:08:23.906 --> 00:08:28.676\nBut keeping it in that kind of\nreferencing type modality of like\n\n167\n00:08:28.676 --> 00:08:30.570\nwhatever changes here.\n\n168\n00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:33.260\nSo that way if anything\nchanges these changes,\n\n169\n00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.842\nwhich is then gonna change my data table.\n\n170\n00:08:34.842 --> 00:08:37.508\nSo it's all kind of interwoven and\ninterconnected, so\n\n171\n00:08:37.508 --> 00:08:39.162\njust that little tip right there.\n\n172\n00:08:39.162 --> 00:08:42.377\nSo now what I need to do\nis I need to make a table,\n\n173\n00:08:42.377 --> 00:08:46.591\nthis is a one variable table,\nbut I have to get an increment.\n\n174\n00:08:46.591 --> 00:08:51.878\nSo if I have 5,000, let's go with,\nwe're gonna change it every 2,500.\n\n175\n00:08:51.878 --> 00:08:55.879\nSo this is just a review from our\nessentials of why we're doing a fill.\n\n176\n00:08:55.879 --> 00:09:00.140\nSo we're going to go ahead and type in\ntwo of our cells with our increment.\n\n177\n00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:04.010\nWe will then select them,\nget a white plus sign.\n\n178\n00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:08.376\nThen get the fill handle, our black plus\nsign, and then we're gonna pull this down.\n\n179\n00:09:08.376 --> 00:09:12.750\nYou can see it kind of pop in right\nthere to where I am making my\n\n180\n00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:16.775\niterations of what I want to\nsee in the change of units,\n\n181\n00:09:16.775 --> 00:09:20.470\nthen changing my bottom line,\nthat cost per toy.\n\n182\n00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:25.380\nSo I've got this in my row,\nthis in my column.\n\n183\n00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.410\nI have another column of where I want.\n\n184\n00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:29.300\nYou have the answers populated.\n\n185\n00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:30.520\nSo I've got everything set up.\n\n186\n00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:36.320\nNow I'm going to perform the actual\ncommand of creating that data table.\n\n187\n00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.454\nSo you do have to kind of think of\nthe setup of what you're doing.\n\n188\n00:09:39.454 --> 00:09:43.505\nSo I'm gonna select the first,\nactually this is where I always mess up.\n\n189\n00:09:43.505 --> 00:09:46.983\nI always wanted to select that one\ncell and go ahead and say populate.\n\n190\n00:09:46.983 --> 00:09:50.532\nBut for\nit to be able to populate your data table,\n\n191\n00:09:50.532 --> 00:09:55.310\nyou have to give it the rows and\ncolumns that it needs to populate.\n\n192\n00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:58.850\nSo that's one of the things that I always\nforget, so don't you forget it too.\n\n193\n00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:01.780\nSo we wanna select this\nwhole range right here.\n\n194\n00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:05.276\nSo think, these are my rows,\nthese are my columns.\n\n195\n00:10:05.276 --> 00:10:09.805\nAnd so this is where I want the data table\nto populate within this one variable.\n\n196\n00:10:09.805 --> 00:10:12.330\nSo that, you need to go ahead and\ndo first.\n\n197\n00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.290\nNow we're gonna go over\nhere to our Data tab.\n\n198\n00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:18.220\nWe're gonna come over here\nto our Data Tools, and\n\n199\n00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.960\nwe're gonna go over to this\nlittle button right here.\n\n200\n00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.660\nYou might actually see\nmore of a button with\n\n201\n00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.260\nwords next to it because\nof your screen resolution.\n\n202\n00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.690\nSo you could see that this is\nnot consolidate, I'm sorry,\n\n203\n00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:31.325\nI'm on the wrong place,\nthis is a data table.\n\n204\n00:10:31.325 --> 00:10:33.810\n[LAUGH] Sorry,\nI was getting a little ahead of myself.\n\n205\n00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:36.860\nI am gonna record an episode about\nconsolidating, but guess what?\n\n206\n00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:38.110\n&gt;&gt; Almost there but not quite.\n\n207\n00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:39.140\n&gt;&gt; That's not what we're doing right now.\n\n208\n00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.010\nAll right, Zach.\n\n209\n00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:42.490\n[LAUGH] So we've got the What-If Analysis.\n\n210\n00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:43.510\nSorry about that, guys.\n\n211\n00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:45.946\nWe're gonna go to Data Table, there we go.\n\n212\n00:10:45.946 --> 00:10:50.424\nSo now this one, all right,\nso what is my row input?\n\n213\n00:10:50.424 --> 00:10:52.560\nWhat is my column input?\n\n214\n00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:56.240\nIn this example,\nsince we're only doing a one variable.\n\n215\n00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.420\nWe're either doing a row or a column.\n\n216\n00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.220\nWell, what are the things\nthat I want to see,\n\n217\n00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:06.298\nthe What-If Analysis by,\nit's in a column, it's going down.\n\n218\n00:11:06.298 --> 00:11:10.430\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So these are the units right here,\n\n219\n00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:13.010\nare going down here.\n\n220\n00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:16.396\nSo I would need to go ahead and\nput my cursor in the column.\n\n221\n00:11:16.396 --> 00:11:22.769\nSo the column input needs to change\nbased on this cell within how\n\n222\n00:11:22.769 --> 00:11:28.672\nI'm creating the result of\nall of this which is 2.75.\n\n223\n00:11:28.672 --> 00:11:33.545\nSo this is the variable that I want\nto change and it is going down,\n\n224\n00:11:33.545 --> 00:11:35.005\nso it's a column.\n\n225\n00:11:35.005 --> 00:11:38.471\nSo if I click OK and\nthen poof, there it goes.\n\n226\n00:11:38.471 --> 00:11:39.620\n&gt;&gt; It's magic.\n\n227\n00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:40.920\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty neat, right?\n\n228\n00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.100\nSo you can see that and\nI'll go ahead and select all of these.\n\n229\n00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.270\nThese have some pre-formula.\n\n230\n00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:50.526\nI had already formatted them as currency\nbefore and you can see where I changed it.\n\n231\n00:11:50.526 --> 00:11:52.415\nI went a little bit further\ndown in my iteration.\n\n232\n00:11:52.415 --> 00:11:56.338\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nselect those and make it all currency so\n\n233\n00:11:56.338 --> 00:11:58.601\nyou can see that, all right, cool.\n\n234\n00:11:58.601 --> 00:12:02.489\nSo you can see that if I have\na lower number of units,\n\n235\n00:12:02.489 --> 00:12:05.302\nthen my cost per toy is gonna be high.\n\n236\n00:12:05.302 --> 00:12:10.099\nBecause this is what's not gonna change\nin this particular scenario that we're\n\n237\n00:12:10.099 --> 00:12:11.096\ntalking about.\n\n238\n00:12:11.096 --> 00:12:16.103\nBut if I increase the number of\nunits that I'm going to purchase or\n\n239\n00:12:16.103 --> 00:12:20.836\ncreate, then I could get my\ncost per toy down to $1.10 if I\n\n240\n00:12:20.836 --> 00:12:24.492\ncreate 25,000 units as opposed to 10.\n\n241\n00:12:24.492 --> 00:12:28.992\nSo you can see this could be, this\ndoes a whole bunch of calculations for\n\n242\n00:12:28.992 --> 00:12:31.624\nyou at what if scenario right off the bat.\n\n243\n00:12:31.624 --> 00:12:35.508\nAnd then going back around to say hey,\nlet's go ahead if we got our labor down\n\n244\n00:12:35.508 --> 00:12:38.921\na little bit more than,\nwe'll actually go ahead and type that in.\n\n245\n00:12:38.921 --> 00:12:40.090\nYou can see how that changed.\n\n246\n00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:42.980\nIf I had physically hand coded,\n\n247\n00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:46.430\nif you wanna say put in 2.75, then none\nof these other numbers would come by.\n\n248\n00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:50.550\nSo that kind of pulling\nthis cell from here.\n\n249\n00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:52.038\nThat kind of makes it a little bit easier.\n\n250\n00:12:52.038 --> 00:12:53.454\nSo you can see some kind of fun stuff.\n\n251\n00:12:53.454 --> 00:12:54.660\n&gt;&gt; I have a question for you now.\n\n252\n00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.779\nDoes the mouse have cat nip in it?\n\n253\n00:12:56.779 --> 00:12:58.564\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's important.\n\n254\n00:12:58.564 --> 00:13:02.064\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's a different variety but\nI know that Fuego and\n\n255\n00:13:02.064 --> 00:13:04.240\nBishop would definitely like that.\n\n256\n00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.481\nBishop a little more of Fuego,\nhe's just kind of whatever.\n\n257\n00:13:06.481 --> 00:13:08.796\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I kind of like that.\n\n258\n00:13:08.796 --> 00:13:10.448\nHe's like cat nip in it.\n\n259\n00:13:10.448 --> 00:13:12.821\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I had another cat that was phew,\n\n260\n00:13:12.821 --> 00:13:14.132\nman, she went crazy on it.\n\n261\n00:13:14.132 --> 00:13:14.651\nIt was a lot fun.\n\n262\n00:13:14.651 --> 00:13:19.870\n[LAUGH] All right, so why don't we\ngo over to a two variable table.\n\n263\n00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:24.046\nSo now this is one where we were just\ntalking about how much am I saving.\n\n264\n00:13:24.046 --> 00:13:28.490\nThis was that retail example\nthat we see for different sales.\n\n265\n00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:31.890\nSo we have a price and\na discount and a result.\n\n266\n00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:35.199\nSo and notice, I'm going from $10 to $40.\n\n267\n00:13:35.199 --> 00:13:38.090\nYou can randomly pick whatever\ntype of formula you want for\n\n268\n00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:39.690\nthis example, I guess.\n\n269\n00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:43.690\nYou don't randomly make up your numbers in\nyour sales charts, or anything like that.\n\n270\n00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:47.487\nBut this is my result of C4 times C5.\n\n271\n00:13:47.487 --> 00:13:50.484\nAnd since it's formatted as a percent,\n\n272\n00:13:50.484 --> 00:13:56.050\nthat's where we're going to\nget the $500 is 10% of $5,000.\n\n273\n00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:58.102\nSo we've got that going good.\n\n274\n00:13:58.102 --> 00:14:01.801\nAnd here we've got our,\nI already went ahead and populated that.\n\n275\n00:14:01.801 --> 00:14:05.249\nI wanna see well,\nwhat change in discount and\n\n276\n00:14:05.249 --> 00:14:10.290\nwhat change in price,\nhow is that going to change my results?\n\n277\n00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:13.220\nSo we've got already in a column in a row.\n\n278\n00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:14.900\nThis is why we’re doing that two variable.\n\n279\n00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:16.125\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Let's go ahead and\n\n280\n00:14:16.125 --> 00:14:17.374\nselect both of these or\n\n281\n00:14:17.374 --> 00:14:19.045\nactually this whole range,\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n282\n00:14:19.045 --> 00:14:20.700\n&gt;&gt; Of where my rows and columns go.\n\n283\n00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:23.980\nWe're gonna come back up to our data tab,\nand\n\n284\n00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:25.730\nwe're gonna go to our What-If Analysis.\n\n285\n00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:28.238\nWe're gonna go to our data table and\n\n286\n00:14:28.238 --> 00:14:31.841\nthen we're going to say now,\nwhat is my row input?\n\n287\n00:14:31.841 --> 00:14:33.440\nThat's going across.\n\n288\n00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:38.180\nWell, going across is the price,\nthat's the amount that we're going.\n\n289\n00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:42.696\nSo what is the value over here\nthat is correlating to that?\n\n290\n00:14:42.696 --> 00:14:43.804\nWell, that's the price.\n\n291\n00:14:43.804 --> 00:14:46.950\nSo C4 is going to be my row input.\n\n292\n00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:50.750\nMy column input, that's like how\nmuch of my discount drive want.\n\n293\n00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:52.810\nSo then I go ahead and\nput my cursor in there.\n\n294\n00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:58.344\nI go ahead and select the 10% and\nthen it does it, there you go.\n\n295\n00:14:58.344 --> 00:15:00.798\nSo cool, it is.\n\n296\n00:15:00.798 --> 00:15:06.495\nAnd so you can see this is going to be the\nresult because 5% of $10 is 50 cents and\n\n297\n00:15:06.495 --> 00:15:08.110\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n298\n00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:10.337\nYou can kind of see.\nI tried to give us some numbers that you\n\n299\n00:15:10.337 --> 00:15:12.565\ncan kind of hopefully\ncalculate in your head.\n\n300\n00:15:12.565 --> 00:15:13.075\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n301\n00:15:13.075 --> 00:15:17.130\n&gt;&gt; I still have problems with that\nall the time, but that's okay.\n\n302\n00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:19.080\nI did want to point out, what is it doing?\n\n303\n00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:22.300\nBecause that was something that I didn't\nreally want out in the first example.\n\n304\n00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.070\nIt is creating as what's\nknown as an array.\n\n305\n00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:29.680\nAn array is, the easiest way to put\nit is it's like an egg carton and\n\n306\n00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.580\nthen there's assigned spaces\nin those egg cartons.\n\n307\n00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:38.320\nAnd so what you use is the positions\nof that array to use calculations.\n\n308\n00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.585\nIf you're like what?\n\n309\n00:15:39.585 --> 00:15:42.480\nI know, believe me.\n\n310\n00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.713\nAt least for me,\n\n311\n00:15:43.713 --> 00:15:48.484\nit took a long time to wrap my head\naround what is an actual array.\n\n312\n00:15:48.484 --> 00:15:52.471\nBut it's just think of it in\npositions of what is in position one?\n\n313\n00:15:52.471 --> 00:15:54.500\nThis value.\nWhat is in position two?\n\n314\n00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.793\nThis value.\nAnd then you use those positions,\n\n315\n00:15:56.793 --> 00:16:00.094\nTo be able to do things,\neither in calculations, or\n\n316\n00:16:00.094 --> 00:16:05.133\nyou see this a lot in programming,\nin coding, like web coding and everything.\n\n317\n00:16:05.133 --> 00:16:10.058\nSo Justin over in DevPro.TV,\nI'm sure they talk a lot about arrays.\n\n318\n00:16:10.058 --> 00:16:13.053\nSo, right, you've been a host for him?\n\n319\n00:16:13.053 --> 00:16:14.800\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yes, it's a true story.\n\n320\n00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, and it's not the easiest\nconcept to wrap your head around but-\n\n321\n00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.350\n&gt;&gt; It's a little bit difficult, yeah.\n\n322\n00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:23.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, so if you're not\ncatching on to it just go, that's okay.\n\n323\n00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:26.261\nIt's all right, cuz Excel's just gonna\nmake me want my data table, great.\n\n324\n00:16:26.261 --> 00:16:28.316\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but what if analysis makes it so\n\n325\n00:16:28.316 --> 00:16:29.028\neasy, I think.\n\n326\n00:16:29.028 --> 00:16:32.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you don't have to even know\nwhat an array formula function does.\n\n327\n00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:38.120\nYou just do what the what if analysis\ndoes, which is the data table.\n\n328\n00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.407\nI'm still stuck on\nconsolidation right now.\n\n329\n00:16:40.407 --> 00:16:42.900\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's coming, it's coming.\n\n330\n00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:43.690\n&gt;&gt; I'll get there.\n\n331\n00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:44.430\nI'll get there.\n\n332\n00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:47.919\nAll right, so let's just come back down so\nyou could just see what it's doing.\n\n333\n00:16:47.919 --> 00:16:50.273\nAgain, I'm just doing one of those,\nlet's just look at it.\n\n334\n00:16:50.273 --> 00:16:52.865\nDo you see that the result here,\n\n335\n00:16:52.865 --> 00:16:57.950\nof the first cell within\nthe data table that it populated.\n\n336\n00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:02.660\nNotice we've got some new syntax that\nwe've never seen before in any of these\n\n337\n00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:03.492\nepisodes.\n\n338\n00:17:03.492 --> 00:17:05.750\nWell, that depends on what\norder you're watching them in.\n\n339\n00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:08.110\nBut you can see it has\nthese curly brackets,\n\n340\n00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:12.670\nthe squiggly brackets as I call them,\naround your formula.\n\n341\n00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:14.271\nSo it doesn't just start\noff with an equal sign.\n\n342\n00:17:14.271 --> 00:17:19.505\nIt starts off with this squiggly,\nthen it says this TABLE(C4,C5).\n\n343\n00:17:19.505 --> 00:17:22.196\nAnd so\nyou can see that it's going to just say,\n\n344\n00:17:22.196 --> 00:17:25.648\ntake this table that you're creating,\nusing those C4 and\n\n345\n00:17:25.648 --> 00:17:29.739\nC5 as your references of how you're\ngoing to make that calculation.\n\n346\n00:17:29.739 --> 00:17:31.360\nAnd then it just does it.\n\n347\n00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.610\nI'm not sure if that's the greatest\nexplanation of what it is, but\n\n348\n00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:35.640\nI just wanted you to know\nthat that's the result.\n\n349\n00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:36.960\nAnd you just move on.\n\n350\n00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.779\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If it works, it's not broken.\n\n351\n00:17:39.779 --> 00:17:42.311\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\nSo you can see that it's pretty simple to\n\n352\n00:17:42.311 --> 00:17:43.630\ncreate data tables.\n\n353\n00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:50.390\nYou just have to remember, what is your\ncolumn and row array, or row position?\n\n354\n00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:52.620\nSo you just need to know\nwhich way we're going across.\n\n355\n00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:56.190\nSo just another example,\njust to kinda throw it out there.\n\n356\n00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:59.995\nYou can see that we've got\na PMT function right here.\n\n357\n00:17:59.995 --> 00:18:02.930\nNow, what does a PMT function do?\n\n358\n00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:04.820\nIt calculates your payments.\n\n359\n00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.180\nNow I wouldn't take this\nas the ultimate fact.\n\n360\n00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:12.277\nYou go to your bank, and they'll tell\nyou what you're really gonna go ahead,\n\n361\n00:18:12.277 --> 00:18:15.140\nand yeah, so\nthere's a lot of variables in there.\n\n362\n00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:18.226\nAnd I am not at liberty to tell you\nwhat they are, because I don't know.\n\n363\n00:18:18.226 --> 00:18:23.116\n[LAUGH] But,\nthe whole idea would be that if you have\n\n364\n00:18:23.116 --> 00:18:26.965\na loan amount, you have a loan period.\n\n365\n00:18:26.965 --> 00:18:30.390\nSo you'd pay it off in five years,\nand there's an interest rate.\n\n366\n00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:33.473\nSo then,\nhow many payments is it gonna take, and\n\n367\n00:18:33.473 --> 00:18:35.890\nwhat's gonna be my monthly payment?\n\n368\n00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:36.650\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n369\n00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:38.606\n&gt;&gt; So you take the B5,\nwhich is the interest.\n\n370\n00:18:38.606 --> 00:18:41.150\nYou divide it by 12, cuz it's monthly.\n\n371\n00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:44.940\nThen you go ahead and have some other\nvariables in here, like, all right,\n\n372\n00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:47.950\nwell, this is my loan amount, and\nthis is how long it's gonna take.\n\n373\n00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:51.455\nAnd so, my answer right here would\nbe that it would be $188 for\n\n374\n00:18:51.455 --> 00:18:54.665\na $10,000 loan at a five year,\n5% interest rate.\n\n375\n00:18:54.665 --> 00:18:58.192\nWell, what if I change,\nthis is something you do with cars, or\n\n376\n00:18:58.192 --> 00:19:00.939\nbuying a house or\nanything with any type of loan.\n\n377\n00:19:00.939 --> 00:19:04.704\nYou could do some kind of preliminary\nstuff right here in Excel,\n\n378\n00:19:04.704 --> 00:19:08.172\nto give you a ball park figure\nof what you're going to do.\n\n379\n00:19:08.172 --> 00:19:09.073\n&gt;&gt; That would be good.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n380\n00:19:09.073 --> 00:19:12.430\nSo I went ahead and\nput some across the row.\n\n381\n00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:13.628\nI just did increments of $3,000.\n\n382\n00:19:13.628 --> 00:19:19.270\nSo you can see, 10, 13, 16, 19,\njust to kinda give you some opportunities.\n\n383\n00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:24.040\nThen we have a three year,\nall the way down to a seven year.\n\n384\n00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:24.822\n[LAUGH] Me and\nthat multiplying in my head, right?\n\n385\n00:19:24.822 --> 00:19:28.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n386\n00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:29.919\nwe've got some different variables there.\n\n387\n00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:32.530\nSo we're going to select the whole thing.\n\n388\n00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:36.060\nAgain, you can see it's pretty simple,\nby just make sure you get that area.\n\n389\n00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:36.660\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n390\n00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:39.759\n&gt;&gt; Come over to our what if analysis,\ncuz we're not doing consolidate,\n\n391\n00:19:39.759 --> 00:19:40.977\nwe're doing a data table.\n\n392\n00:19:40.977 --> 00:19:46.230\nMy row input, that's across, so\nthat would be the loan amount.\n\n393\n00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:51.030\nMy column input would be the term of\na loan, so that would be my months.\n\n394\n00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:53.620\nLet me click OK, and then it just does it.\n\n395\n00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:55.280\nSo, there we go, I can now get quickly.\n\n396\n00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.465\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n397\n00:19:56.465 --> 00:19:57.518\n&gt;&gt; Right?\nI love that.\n\n398\n00:19:57.518 --> 00:20:02.078\nNow, to add just one more fun step,\nthis is something that we've done in some\n\n399\n00:20:02.078 --> 00:20:06.019\nother episodes within this\nparticular series of Excel Advanced.\n\n400\n00:20:06.019 --> 00:20:09.376\nIf you haven't gone into data validation,\n\n401\n00:20:09.376 --> 00:20:12.742\nthis is just kind of\na little side note on it.\n\n402\n00:20:12.742 --> 00:20:15.330\nSo, this is one saying, well,\nwhat if I wanna change my interest?\n\n403\n00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:19.263\nBecause I thought, I'm changing\nmy loan amount and my months, but\n\n404\n00:20:19.263 --> 00:20:24.520\nwhat about if I had a 5% interest, or a\n7.5 or a 10%, changing my interest rates.\n\n405\n00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:29.130\nNow, I could physically come in here and\ntype in 10%, and\n\n406\n00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:32.780\nthen because it's all connected,\nall my numbers change in my data table.\n\n407\n00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:36.070\nCool, wouldn't it be fun to just\nkinda have a little dropdown?\n\n408\n00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:36.809\nCuz that's what we're gonna do.\n\n409\n00:20:36.809 --> 00:20:42.430\nWe're gonna go ahead and\ndo a dropdown for my choices.\n\n410\n00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:44.471\nYou have to have your list values\nsomewhere, so you can see,\n\n411\n00:20:44.471 --> 00:20:45.840\nI have 5, 7.5 and 10% over here.\n\n412\n00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:51.335\nSo you have to have that somewhere\nwhether it's in another worksheet or\n\n413\n00:20:51.335 --> 00:20:54.090\nsomewhere hidden, that's fine.\n\n414\n00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:55.607\nBut you gotta have the values typed out.\n\n415\n00:20:55.607 --> 00:20:59.800\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nput my cursor here.\n\n416\n00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.515\nI'm going to go over to my data,\nwhich is where?\n\n417\n00:21:02.515 --> 00:21:04.670\nOkay, sorry, it's this one.\n\n418\n00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:07.490\nWhen I don't have some of the words I\nforget where these buttons are sometimes.\n\n419\n00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:12.900\nSo this is my data validation, and\nI'm putting that in over here in B5.\n\n420\n00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:16.400\nSo we're gonna take this and\nwe're going to allow a list.\n\n421\n00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.630\nNow where is the source of that list?\n\n422\n00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:21.109\nYou put your cursor in the source.\n\n423\n00:21:21.109 --> 00:21:22.993\nYou come out over here.\n\n424\n00:21:22.993 --> 00:21:27.496\nYou select the cells that you want to have\nas your change, your dropdown values.\n\n425\n00:21:27.496 --> 00:21:28.950\nYou click OK.\n\n426\n00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:31.202\nAnd now, you can see I get this\ncute little dropdown right here.\n\n427\n00:21:31.202 --> 00:21:37.697\nSo I can see, all right, well, at 7.5,\nthis is what it is at 5.5, at 10%.\n\n428\n00:21:37.697 --> 00:21:41.353\nAnd you can have your data table\ngo ahead and change like that.\n\n429\n00:21:41.353 --> 00:21:43.350\nSo, pretty cool stuff.\n\n430\n00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:45.525\nAnd the data validation is\nsomething completely different,\n\n431\n00:21:45.525 --> 00:21:47.070\nthat's not part of the data table.\n\n432\n00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:49.720\nJust wanted to throw that in,\nto try to give you some more\n\n433\n00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:53.790\noptions of how you can change these\nvariables, and be able to do this.\n\n434\n00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:54.960\nSo, this can come in handy.\n\n435\n00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.796\nIt's a really cool feature of Excel.\n\n436\n00:21:56.796 --> 00:21:58.566\nIt's been there for a long time, actually.\n\n437\n00:21:58.566 --> 00:22:02.072\nThis has gone back to, I mean,\n2003, I think even before, 2000.\n\n438\n00:22:02.072 --> 00:22:04.976\nAnd I even think,\nif this is the right one,\n\n439\n00:22:04.976 --> 00:22:08.280\nI think this has been\naround since Lotus Notes.\n\n440\n00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:11.750\nI mean this is way,\nway back, but who knows.\n\n441\n00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:16.000\nI might be consolidating my information,\nand consolidating was in there, so hey,\n\n442\n00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:16.820\nguess what?\n\n443\n00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:18.867\nWe're gonna have an episode\non consolidating, too.\n\n444\n00:22:18.867 --> 00:22:20.570\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You couldn't tell that was coming\n\n445\n00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:21.160\nup, could you?\n\n446\n00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:25.230\n&gt;&gt; Right, I know, so yeah, just getting\nmyself a little confused, as always.\n\n447\n00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:28.410\nBut I hope you can see how\npowerful these data tables are,\n\n448\n00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:31.930\nhow really simple they are, as long as you\njust keep remembering, which is my row,\n\n449\n00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:35.060\nwhich is my column, and make sure\nyou select the whole range first.\n\n450\n00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:36.690\nAnd you'll be good to go, so there you go.\n\n451\n00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:37.680\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, awesome.\n&gt;&gt; What if?\n\n452\n00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:40.010\n&gt;&gt; You were great, Instructor Vonne,\nthank you so very much.\n\n453\n00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:42.637\nData tables, data tables,\n[LAUGH] your choice.\n\n454\n00:22:42.637 --> 00:22:44.524\n[LAUGH] As we look at Excel 2016 Advanced.\n\n455\n00:22:44.524 --> 00:22:48.790\nAnd there's a whole bunch of episodes\nin the Excel 2016 Advanced series.\n\n456\n00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:49.780\nPlease watch them all.\n\n457\n00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:51.450\nAgain, Vonne, thank you so very much.\n\n458\n00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:53.067\nAnd thank you for watching Office Pro

That's bad.\n\n23\n00:01:01.041 --> 00:01:04.421\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, when you have to get rid\nof some of those things In this instance,\n\n24\n00:01:04.421 --> 00:01:06.023\nwe're not getting rid of anything.\n\n25\n00:01:06.023 --> 00:01:08.160\nBut like you said,\nwe're bringing it all together.\n\n26\n00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.499\nWe're gonna combine\ndata into one location.\n\n27\n00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:15.171\nNow this is something that we've\ndone in some other episodes and\n\n28\n00:01:15.171 --> 00:01:16.266\nmaybe you've seen this.\n\n29\n00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:20.937\nAnd so, I don't want you to say,\nthat kinda seems like a 3D cell reference.\n\n30\n00:01:20.937 --> 00:01:25.156\nCouldn't I just do the same thing\nthat I'm going to show you with just\n\n31\n00:01:25.156 --> 00:01:26.697\na regular sum function?\n\n32\n00:01:26.697 --> 00:01:27.966\nYeah, you could.\n\n33\n00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:30.921\nSo this is one of those things\nthat just like with everything and\n\n34\n00:01:30.921 --> 00:01:33.951\nall these Office products,\nthere's so many ways you could do-\n\n35\n00:01:33.951 --> 00:01:34.527\n&gt;&gt; Options.\n\n36\n00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:36.510\n&gt;&gt; Yes, the kind of the same thing.\n\n37\n00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.176\nIt's kind of the same thing.\n\n38\n00:01:39.176 --> 00:01:41.858\nThere's always those\nlittle variables in there.\n\n39\n00:01:41.858 --> 00:01:46.712\nBut this is a feature that does exactly\nwhat it says, it's going to take the data\n\n40\n00:01:46.712 --> 00:01:50.633\nand consolidate it into whatever\nfunction you want it to apply.\n\n41\n00:01:50.633 --> 00:01:54.303\nNow that either means sum,\nor count, or any of those.\n\n42\n00:01:54.303 --> 00:01:58.874\nNow I've told you many times within this\nparticular series of Excel 2016 Advanced\n\n43\n00:01:58.874 --> 00:02:03.196\nthat we're not really concentrating on\nthe formulas and the functions of Excel,\n\n44\n00:02:03.196 --> 00:02:05.027\ncuz we have a whole separate show.\n\n45\n00:02:05.027 --> 00:02:09.918\nAnd we're still doing that, but with this\none it is kind of one of those ways that\n\n46\n00:02:09.918 --> 00:02:14.605\nyou are analyzing data and being able\nto kinda pull those different things.\n\n47\n00:02:14.605 --> 00:02:19.610\nSo it does involve somewhat of\na function but not in a direct way.\n\n48\n00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.851\nSo well, how about I show you?\n\n49\n00:02:21.851 --> 00:02:22.930\n&gt;&gt; I would like that very much!\n\n50\n00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:23.435\nThank you!\n\n51\n00:02:23.435 --> 00:02:27.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So I have an Excel file\nright here called consolidate,\n\n52\n00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.770\nand this just some monthly sales.\n\n53\n00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.320\nNow, we've been talking about\nChristmas Cats Incorporated and\n\n54\n00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.560\nwe've talked about pivot tables and\nall sorts of different things.\n\n55\n00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.560\nYou've probably seen this information, but\nwe've got just some different categories.\n\n56\n00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.491\nYou can see we have toys, food, clothing,\naccessories, and so you can see they're\n\n57\n00:02:42.491 --> 00:02:46.159\nnot all in any order or anything like\nthat, and there's some unit prices here.\n\n58\n00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:49.680\nSo let's just say I would\nlike to consolidate.\n\n59\n00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.340\nTell me what the sum of all the toys,\nall the food, clothing, and\n\n60\n00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.995\naccessories, each one of these categories,\nand then go ahead and give me the results.\n\n61\n00:02:59.995 --> 00:03:01.275\nSeems pretty simple.\n\n62\n00:03:01.275 --> 00:03:03.935\nThis is something well,\nI can format this as a table and\n\n63\n00:03:03.935 --> 00:03:07.185\nthen use my little total rows\ndown there totally find it.\n\n64\n00:03:07.185 --> 00:03:10.363\nAgain you could do this in\na lot of different ways.\n\n65\n00:03:10.363 --> 00:03:14.295\nBut let me show you what\nconsolidate function will command.\n\n66\n00:03:14.295 --> 00:03:17.605\nI want to try and just keep away from\nfunctions since we are talking about\n\n67\n00:03:17.605 --> 00:03:20.486\nfunctions within Excel that\nare a little bit different here.\n\n68\n00:03:20.486 --> 00:03:23.750\nSo, we're gonna do first\nis take the heading.\n\n69\n00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.711\nSo you do need to have headings because\nit's gonna use those to know what\n\n70\n00:03:27.711 --> 00:03:29.362\ncategory, if you wanna say,\n\n71\n00:03:29.362 --> 00:03:33.735\nthat you're going to be doing these\nparticular consolidating functions on.\n\n72\n00:03:33.735 --> 00:03:37.367\n&gt;&gt; And may I just say that at this point,\nthat I think you're category for\n\n73\n00:03:37.367 --> 00:03:38.855\nChristmas Cats is perfect.\n\n74\n00:03:38.855 --> 00:03:42.375\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I perfectly agree.\n\n75\n00:03:42.375 --> 00:03:44.403\n[LAUGH] I love it.\n\n76\n00:03:44.403 --> 00:03:45.755\n&gt;&gt; I'm not doing that again.\n\n77\n00:03:45.755 --> 00:03:48.605\n&gt;&gt; I love all the cat puns.\n\n78\n00:03:48.605 --> 00:03:49.750\nKeep them coming.\n\n79\n00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.614\n[LAUGH] So\nwe have our category unit price.\n\n80\n00:03:52.614 --> 00:03:56.480\nI went ahead and\ncopied over our heading over here.\n\n81\n00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.600\nNothing special there.\n\n82\n00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.472\nSo now what I'd like to do is I'm gonna\nput my cursor here of where I'd like to\n\n83\n00:04:01.472 --> 00:04:03.930\nconsolidate the information.\n\n84\n00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.370\nSo that's what we're going to do.\n\n85\n00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.840\nWe're going to go over to our data tab.\n\n86\n00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.910\nAnd we're gonna go over here to this\nbutton right up here that looks like\n\n87\n00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.890\nlittle blocks going into one.\n\n88\n00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.290\nSummarizing data from separate ranges and\nit goes ahead and calculates it and\n\n89\n00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.910\nputs it into a single place.\n\n90\n00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.770\nSo I'm going to click on this and\nit gives us this dialogue box.\n\n91\n00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.343\nSo what am I doing here?\n\n92\n00:04:24.343 --> 00:04:26.830\nSum is a pretty standard one.\n\n93\n00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:27.760\nI wanna consolidate this.\n\n94\n00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.407\nBut you can see that there are other\nfunctions if I wanna do a count,\n\n95\n00:04:31.407 --> 00:04:35.074\nor an average, or some of our other\nbasic functions within Excel.\n\n96\n00:04:35.074 --> 00:04:38.523\nBut we're just gonna stay\nwith the adding it all up.\n\n97\n00:04:38.523 --> 00:04:43.735\nAnd then what you're gonna do is you're\ngoing to tell it what your references are,\n\n98\n00:04:43.735 --> 00:04:46.718\nwhat your ranges that\nyou want to consolidate.\n\n99\n00:04:46.718 --> 00:04:50.648\nWe're starting with this simple one right\nhere which is a single range within\n\n100\n00:04:50.648 --> 00:04:54.216\nthe same worksheet, and the next\nexample will get a little crazier and\n\n101\n00:04:54.216 --> 00:04:56.896\ngo across multiple workbooks and\nthings like that.\n\n102\n00:04:56.896 --> 00:05:00.090\nSo you're gonna put your cursor in\nhere where you have your reference.\n\n103\n00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.606\nAnd then with the flashing cursor in\nthat field, you're gonna come out and\n\n104\n00:05:04.606 --> 00:05:05.688\nfind your range.\n\n105\n00:05:05.688 --> 00:05:12.653\nSo I'm gonna come in here, and\nselect A1 down through B26, there we go.\n\n106\n00:05:12.653 --> 00:05:19.530\nSo I've got both of my columns, and all of\nmy rows of this, it's not really a table.\n\n107\n00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.868\nWe're gonna call it a range cuz,\nwell, that's what it is.\n\n108\n00:05:21.868 --> 00:05:24.031\n&gt;&gt; That's what it is.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So we have our range, and so\n\n109\n00:05:24.031 --> 00:05:27.707\nthe biggest I need to do here is always\nto remember to hit the Add button,\n\n110\n00:05:27.707 --> 00:05:32.270\ncuz a lot of people just click OK, and\nthen it's like, well, it didn't work.\n\n111\n00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:37.046\nYeah, you gotta put it down into bringing\nin your references, and this is where if\n\n112\n00:05:37.046 --> 00:05:41.963\nyou have multiple ones, when we get into\nmultiple worksheets and or workbooks, you\n\n113\n00:05:41.963 --> 00:05:46.908\ngo ahead and just say, these are all the\nreferences, now go ahead and consolidate.\n\n114\n00:05:46.908 --> 00:05:50.875\nBut there's a couple other things that\nyou need to be paying attention to, and\n\n115\n00:05:50.875 --> 00:05:52.993\nthat's these bottom buttons down here.\n\n116\n00:05:52.993 --> 00:05:57.057\nUse labels in top row or left column.\n\n117\n00:05:57.057 --> 00:06:02.934\nNow this is the thing where you wanna say,\nhey what's that repeating category?\n\n118\n00:06:02.934 --> 00:06:08.090\nAnd in this sense, if you look\nat our data, we have toys, food,\n\n119\n00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:09.700\nclothing, accessories, toys.\n\n120\n00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.030\nThat's where I say,\nevery time there is a toys,\n\n121\n00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.120\ntell me what that unit price is and\nthen calculate it all up.\n\n122\n00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.090\nSo that's what you're saying,\nthat you want the left column.\n\n123\n00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.892\nThat's the thing it's\ngonna use as a reference,\n\n124\n00:06:23.892 --> 00:06:26.304\nas the thing that it needs to consolidate.\n\n125\n00:06:26.304 --> 00:06:27.590\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; If it sees toys,\n\n126\n00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:28.710\nit'll consolidate all of the toys.\n\n127\n00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.175\nIf it sees the food, clothing, and\naccessories, consolidate it all up,\n\n128\n00:06:32.175 --> 00:06:33.715\nand that's what you want.\n\n129\n00:06:33.715 --> 00:06:36.655\nI don't have to worry about a top row for\nthis particular example because\n\n130\n00:06:36.655 --> 00:06:41.025\nthe only thing it needs to\nlook at is that left column.\n\n131\n00:06:41.025 --> 00:06:44.035\nAnd we're not gonna talk about the Create\nlinks in this particular example but\n\n132\n00:06:44.035 --> 00:06:45.285\nwe will get to it in another one.\n\n133\n00:06:45.285 --> 00:06:46.995\nSo that's all you gotta do.\n\n134\n00:06:46.995 --> 00:06:49.295\nHere's my range, consolidate it down.\n\n135\n00:06:49.295 --> 00:06:53.785\nIt is where my cursor, or what cell\nI had selected before I started this.\n\n136\n00:06:53.785 --> 00:06:54.778\nYou click OK.\n\n137\n00:06:54.778 --> 00:06:56.437\nAnd there you go, that's it.\n\n138\n00:06:56.437 --> 00:06:59.540\nNow, it did pull this,\nright up here, the category.\n\n139\n00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:03.987\nThat's only because I actually\nselected within my range, in that,\n\n140\n00:07:03.987 --> 00:07:05.990\nthat I selected the headings.\n\n141\n00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.920\nI could have just really\nselected A2 down through there.\n\n142\n00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.490\nBecause I already had\nthe headings copied over.\n\n143\n00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:14.780\nIt didn't really need to have that.\n\n144\n00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.950\nSo that's why it went ahead and\nrepeated that category up at the top.\n\n145\n00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.250\nSo that's just something that\nyou didn't have to include\n\n146\n00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.240\nthe headings in the selection.\n\n147\n00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.150\nBut you can see that there it is,\nthere's the toys and the food, and\n\n148\n00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:32.010\nI've actually done a calculation off\nto the side where I verified this.\n\n149\n00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:36.434\nThis is one of those like, I never trust\nit right away, it's like did you do this?\n\n150\n00:07:36.434 --> 00:07:39.830\nSo I formatted it as a table,\nput the sub totals on, filter it out.\n\n151\n00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.500\nBut do you see,\nI just did one, two, three.\n\n152\n00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.329\nI did a whole bunch of steps when\nI could have just went bloop and\n\n153\n00:07:44.329 --> 00:07:45.320\nconsolidated down.\n\n154\n00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.365\n&gt;&gt; Bloop is better.\n\n155\n00:07:46.365 --> 00:07:48.450\n&gt;&gt; Yes, a bloop is always better.\n\n156\n00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:50.828\n[LAUGH] So you can see that\nI have this different one.\n\n157\n00:07:50.828 --> 00:07:52.699\nNow, notice the gap in our Formula bar.\n\n158\n00:07:52.699 --> 00:07:56.453\nIt's not creating any type of function.\n\n159\n00:07:56.453 --> 00:07:59.995\nOr anything that kinda\npulls from another place.\n\n160\n00:07:59.995 --> 00:08:02.770\nWhat I mean by that is,\nif I came over here and\n\n161\n00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:07.768\nchanged this to $100,000,\nthat didn't change that at all, did it?\n\n162\n00:08:07.768 --> 00:08:08.849\nNo.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n163\n00:08:08.849 --> 00:08:09.458\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n164\n00:08:09.458 --> 00:08:13.982\nthis consolidating with the way\nthat I just did that example,\n\n165\n00:08:13.982 --> 00:08:18.680\nit's not going to recalculate\nthat consolidation if you change\n\n166\n00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.560\nthe source data, if you wanna call it.\n\n167\n00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.486\nSo it doesn't do that automatically, one,\n\n168\n00:08:24.486 --> 00:08:29.113\nbecause I didn't check off that box\nthat said create links to the data.\n\n169\n00:08:29.113 --> 00:08:30.940\nSo that's one big thing.\n\n170\n00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:32.671\nAnd two, in this particular example,\n\n171\n00:08:32.671 --> 00:08:34.827\nI couldn't even do that\nbecause it doesn't do.\n\n172\n00:08:34.827 --> 00:08:38.618\nIf you're in a single sheet,\nthe linking doesn't really work.\n\n173\n00:08:38.618 --> 00:08:44.179\nSo these are, again, one of those things\nwhere you might have gone with a different\n\n174\n00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:48.391\nway of coming about consolidating\nthis down using a function or\n\n175\n00:08:48.391 --> 00:08:51.508\na table or even pivot tables and\npivot charts.\n\n176\n00:08:51.508 --> 00:08:56.989\nAgain, lots of different ways I could\nget this data to do what I want,\n\n177\n00:08:56.989 --> 00:08:58.607\nto get this result.\n\n178\n00:08:58.607 --> 00:09:02.110\nBut anyways, I wanted to show you\nthe consolidate command, well,\n\n179\n00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:04.209\nbecause it's the title of the episode.\n\n180\n00:09:04.209 --> 00:09:05.650\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good to me.\n\n181\n00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:07.512\n&gt;&gt; And it's been around for a long time.\n\n182\n00:09:07.512 --> 00:09:09.790\nI did do a little fact checking.\n\n183\n00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:15.280\nIf anybody did watch the data table\nthat has been around since Lotus Notes.\n\n184\n00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.510\nAt the end I'm like,\nI can't remember which one it was.\n\n185\n00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:18.600\nYeah, that was the one.\n\n186\n00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.130\nThis one's been around I think all\nthe way back to at least 2000,\n\n187\n00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:23.290\nmaybe even earlier than that.\n\n188\n00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:23.842\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n189\n00:09:23.842 --> 00:09:24.427\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n190\n00:09:24.427 --> 00:09:28.142\npretty cool command\n[LAUGH] that Excel can do.\n\n191\n00:09:28.142 --> 00:09:32.509\nAnd some other ones that I wanted to show\nyou and I'm actually gonna go ahead and\n\n192\n00:09:32.509 --> 00:09:34.580\nclose this particular file out.\n\n193\n00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:35.810\nAnd we don't need to save the changes.\n\n194\n00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:38.130\nYou guys can have it as is.\n\n195\n00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:41.083\nI have some other examples that\nwe're gonna go across workbooks.\n\n196\n00:09:41.083 --> 00:09:44.470\nSo we're gonna take it to\nthe next level of consolidating.\n\n197\n00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:46.920\nSo you can see,\nI have a consolidated January.\n\n198\n00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.190\nAnd these are just some sales figures.\n\n199\n00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:51.616\nOr I think we're doing sales,\nI just put numbers.\n\n200\n00:09:51.616 --> 00:09:53.865\nMaybe it's amount of cat toys sold.\n\n201\n00:09:53.865 --> 00:09:57.722\nYeah, I think that's what I did,\namount of cat toys.\n\n202\n00:09:57.722 --> 00:09:59.606\nSo [LAUGH] we have let's go ahead and\nopen up February.\n\n203\n00:09:59.606 --> 00:10:01.610\nI should probably just one and\nI got that one too.\n\n204\n00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:04.310\nSo let's look at these files a little bit.\n\n205\n00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:04.972\nIn January,\n\n206\n00:10:04.972 --> 00:10:08.840\nyou can see that the toys that we have\nsold across a couple different stores.\n\n207\n00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.750\nSo we have our Gainesville,\nJacksonville, and Orlando stores.\n\n208\n00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:14.586\nAnd we have a couple\ndifferent types of toys.\n\n209\n00:10:14.586 --> 00:10:15.398\nThe snake one.\n\n210\n00:10:15.398 --> 00:10:19.022\nYou get that around that Bishop,\nhe like freaks out.\n\n211\n00:10:19.022 --> 00:10:20.550\nHe starts growling at you.\n\n212\n00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:24.183\nAnd she like, kinda like hides it and\nruns away with it.\n\n213\n00:10:24.183 --> 00:10:25.890\nI've actually had to start hiding them.\n\n214\n00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:27.440\nSo it's a love hate relationship.\n\n215\n00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.830\nMy goodness.\nIt's like you can't come near him.\n\n216\n00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:33.340\nSo we have to hide it cuz he get's so\nfreaked out.\n\n217\n00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.472\nIt's kinda scary actually.\n\n218\n00:10:36.472 --> 00:10:38.117\n[LAUGH] So I have some-\n&gt;&gt; Keep the snake away.\n\n219\n00:10:38.117 --> 00:10:38.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n220\n00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.200\n&gt;&gt; Do it.\n\n221\n00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.678\n&gt;&gt; Well, then he goes outside and\nkills real ones.\n\n222\n00:10:41.678 --> 00:10:42.704\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, it's really bad.\n\n223\n00:10:42.704 --> 00:10:43.912\nI know it's bad, but anyways.\n\n224\n00:10:43.912 --> 00:10:47.531\n[LAUGH] So we have some Mouse,\nSnake, Crinkles,\n\n225\n00:10:47.531 --> 00:10:50.480\nsome Bouncy Balls, and some Spirals.\n\n226\n00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:54.955\nLet's look at the February Now notice,\nI did this on purpose.\n\n227\n00:10:54.955 --> 00:10:57.035\nIt's not in the same order, is it?\n\n228\n00:10:57.035 --> 00:10:58.297\nOkay, we have bouncy balls.\n\n229\n00:10:58.297 --> 00:11:00.155\nAnd then we have jumping frog.\n\n230\n00:11:00.155 --> 00:11:01.715\nThat wasn't on the January one, was it?\n\n231\n00:11:01.715 --> 00:11:03.821\nMm-mm.\nNo, and we have some, and\n\n232\n00:11:03.821 --> 00:11:07.235\na heart mouse cuz we figure that February,\nValentine's Day.\n\n233\n00:11:07.235 --> 00:11:10.380\nSo we have ones like a mouse with\nhearts on it or something like that.\n\n234\n00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:14.540\nSo trying to show you that this is\ndifferent order, different data.\n\n235\n00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:19.280\nIt's not the same amount of the exact\nsame data in the exact same spot.\n\n236\n00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:24.162\nThat's where they set 3D cell\nreferences and everything.\n\n237\n00:11:24.162 --> 00:11:27.890\nIt doesn't always work with\nvarying amounts of data.\n\n238\n00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:32.470\nBut, this consolidate will\nwork a little bit better.\n\n239\n00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:35.610\nLet's look at our March over here.\n\n240\n00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:36.860\nSo now, we've got a heart mouse.\n\n241\n00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.503\nCuz maybe there was\nsome other [INAUDIBLE].\n\n242\n00:11:38.503 --> 00:11:42.830\nAnd then we have a bunny mask because\ngetting towards Easter, things like that.\n\n243\n00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:43.630\n&gt;&gt; Certainly.\n\n244\n00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:44.920\n&gt;&gt; Again, different order.\n\n245\n00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.688\nAnd look at this one,\nwe have a Tampa store.\n\n246\n00:11:46.688 --> 00:11:49.790\nWe opened a new store in Tampa.\n\n247\n00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:54.710\nSo, we've got different types of data but\nyet, it's very similar.\n\n248\n00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:55.670\nSo it can't be so\n\n249\n00:11:55.670 --> 00:12:00.230\nfar off cuz then it kinda defeats\nthe whole purpose of consolidating.\n\n250\n00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:05.910\nSo what I'd like to do is consolidate\nall this down into what toys and\n\n251\n00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:07.390\nthen what stores.\n\n252\n00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:13.060\nSo you can see that the mouse is across\na couple of them or the bouncy balls.\n\n253\n00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:13.805\nSo yeah, there we go.\n\n254\n00:12:13.805 --> 00:12:15.510\nWe had a snake wand, there we go.\n\n255\n00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:20.500\nThere the snake wand is in February and\nJanuary and March, but\n\n256\n00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.630\nin different places.\n\n257\n00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:26.320\nSo the cool thing about this particular\ncommand is it's smart enough to know hey,\n\n258\n00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.700\nlet's go ahead and see.\n\n259\n00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.170\nIf it repeats I'll go ahead and\nuse that function.\n\n260\n00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:34.590\nIf it's not repeating I'm still gonna\nadd it so it doesn't take it away.\n\n261\n00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:35.840\nIt's pretty cool, right?\n\n262\n00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.380\nSo let's go ahead and do a File, New.\n\n263\n00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.020\nSorry, I just did a keyboard\nshortcut right there.\n\n264\n00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:43.740\nI did a Ctrl+N for File New.\n\n265\n00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.600\nSo a new workbook, cuz I'd like for\n\n266\n00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.950\nit to be able to consolidate\ndown into a brand new workbook.\n\n267\n00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:49.650\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n268\n00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:51.235\n&gt;&gt; Let's go over to Data.\n\n269\n00:12:51.235 --> 00:12:54.130\nAnd we're gonna go over\nto our Consolidate.\n\n270\n00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:56.830\nAnd we're going to do some\nof these different options.\n\n271\n00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:58.830\nWe're going to do our function of SUM.\n\n272\n00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:00.660\nWe're going to reference this.\n\n273\n00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:04.540\nNow I have all the files open,\nand it makes it a little easier.\n\n274\n00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:05.447\nSo I would go ahead and\n\n275\n00:13:05.447 --> 00:13:09.089\ngive you a suggestion that if you're doing\nmultiple files go ahead and open them all.\n\n276\n00:13:09.089 --> 00:13:10.449\nSo got my cursor in there.\n\n277\n00:13:10.449 --> 00:13:12.859\nNow all I gotta do is just navigate to it.\n\n278\n00:13:12.859 --> 00:13:14.216\nLet's start with January.\n\n279\n00:13:14.216 --> 00:13:15.776\nAnd we will then select.\n\n280\n00:13:15.776 --> 00:13:17.850\nI'm gonna go ahead and grab all of this.\n\n281\n00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:19.660\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good, that makes sense.\n\n282\n00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.221\n&gt;&gt; I am gonna pull in\nthose headings in there.\n\n283\n00:13:21.221 --> 00:13:25.648\nAnd you can see the way that there are,\nthe writing is in the braces.\n\n284\n00:13:25.648 --> 00:13:27.823\nWe've got consolidate,\nthat's the file name.\n\n285\n00:13:27.823 --> 00:13:31.360\nToysJan with the exclamation,\nthat's the sheet name.\n\n286\n00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:35.510\nAnd then the absolute\nreferences of A4 through D9.\n\n287\n00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:36.980\nSo I've got that there.\n\n288\n00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:38.230\nRemember our trick?\n\n289\n00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:39.960\nYou've gotta add it.\n\n290\n00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:40.970\nThere's my first reference.\n\n291\n00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:44.590\nNow when you're using multiple files,\nI'll tell you, it's a little\n\n292\n00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:49.190\neasier if you go ahead and take this,\nand go ahead and delete all of this.\n\n293\n00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:49.860\nAnd you know what?\n\n294\n00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:52.720\nThe other thing it's doing\nis I just realized that.\n\n295\n00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:57.836\nBecause I haven't saved this file, so\nyou see how it's using like what's known\n\n296\n00:13:57.836 --> 00:14:03.345\nas an absolute path to my file, notice I\ndid like Users/JT/Desktop/consolidate.\n\n297\n00:14:03.345 --> 00:14:07.586\nThat's because this workbook that I'm\ngoing to be putting this information to is\n\n298\n00:14:07.586 --> 00:14:08.710\njust book one.\n\n299\n00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:10.110\nIt hasn't been saved.\n\n300\n00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:14.690\nSo that's why it's using\nthose particular references.\n\n301\n00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:17.136\nIt'll turn around and\nit will update itself.\n\n302\n00:14:17.136 --> 00:14:21.200\nBut just wanting to know where did\nall that other stuff come from, and\n\n303\n00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.050\nthat's why.\n\n304\n00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:25.972\nBut back to how I was\ngetting around to this.\n\n305\n00:14:25.972 --> 00:14:29.470\nWhen you're going across multiple files\ncuz you see I'm still on January.\n\n306\n00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:33.434\nIt kinda gets a little confusing when\nyou're going across multiple workbooks.\n\n307\n00:14:33.434 --> 00:14:36.500\nSo what I suggest is taking a reference.\n\n308\n00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:41.380\nOnce you've added it down into in this\nparticular field right here go ahead and\n\n309\n00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.530\nget rid of anything, clear it out.\n\n310\n00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.680\nYou don't have to, but\n\n311\n00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:50.060\nit will keep your brain in order a little\nbit more if you just clear it out.\n\n312\n00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:50.870\nI've got it down here.\n\n313\n00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:52.430\nLet's move on to the next one.\n\n314\n00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:55.080\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH] Bishop would\nprobably like that.\n\n407\n00:19:02.339 --> 00:19:03.419\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm sure.\n\n408\n00:19:03.419 --> 00:19:06.948\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You really don't wanna know\nmore than what he actually goes ahead and\n\n409\n00:19:06.948 --> 00:19:08.640\nhunts out there in the wilderness.\n\n410\n00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.380\nSo [LAUGH] he is a cat.\n\n411\n00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:11.170\n&gt;&gt; He is.\n\n412\n00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:15.050\n&gt;&gt; But anyways, we've got the create links\nto source data, let's see what that is.\n\n413\n00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:18.813\nNotice I do have my cursor in book\none of where I want to go ahead and\n\n414\n00:19:18.813 --> 00:19:21.905\npopulate the consolidated\ninformation into here.\n\n415\n00:19:21.905 --> 00:19:23.926\nNow we've got that checked off,\nwe click OK.\n\n416\n00:19:23.926 --> 00:19:26.783\nAnd let's see the difference.\n\n417\n00:19:26.783 --> 00:19:30.169\nWell there's a couple differences,\nat first, your like mm not,\n\n418\n00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:31.685\ndoesn't look to different.\n\n419\n00:19:31.685 --> 00:19:36.809\nLook at over here,\nwhat it's doing is adding an outline.\n\n420\n00:19:36.809 --> 00:19:39.721\nOkay, and this is something that we\ndid in the group and outline and\n\n421\n00:19:39.721 --> 00:19:43.158\nwe also did subtotals, this very familiar\nto where you're doing sub totals.\n\n422\n00:19:43.158 --> 00:19:46.108\nBut with sub totals you can only\ndo it from within one sheet,\n\n423\n00:19:46.108 --> 00:19:48.535\nyou can't go across\nmultiple sheets like that.\n\n424\n00:19:48.535 --> 00:19:52.506\nSo if I expand this out,\nyou see it's actually consolidating all of\n\n425\n00:19:52.506 --> 00:19:57.104\nthe different places where the bouncy\nballs are at and it's showing the 68,\n\n426\n00:19:57.104 --> 00:19:57.955\n20, 61.\n\n427\n00:19:57.955 --> 00:20:04.035\nThose are the ones from the actual numbers\nthat are in our actual source data.\n\n428\n00:20:04.035 --> 00:20:06.683\nSo it's showing you that\nin an outline form.\n\n429\n00:20:06.683 --> 00:20:10.674\nSo you could click all of the details, and\nif I expand this column out just so you\n\n430\n00:20:10.674 --> 00:20:15.418\ncould see, there's the February, January,\nand March, and it's giving you a subtotal.\n\n431\n00:20:15.418 --> 00:20:19.898\nSo that's kind of a neat feature of\nusing the consolidate command across\n\n432\n00:20:19.898 --> 00:20:22.254\nmultiple workbooks using that link.\n\n433\n00:20:22.254 --> 00:20:22.860\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n434\n00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:27.572\n&gt;&gt; And then it gives you this, and, of\ncourse, if now I go out to February, and\n\n435\n00:20:27.572 --> 00:20:29.279\nwait, which one was that?\n\n436\n00:20:29.279 --> 00:20:33.610\nWas it the bouncy ball, okay, perfect.\n\n437\n00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:37.070\nSo I'm gonna come over here to February,\nfind the bouncy ball,\n\n438\n00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:41.340\nchange this to 168 instead of 68.\n\n439\n00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:46.376\nCome back over here to workbook one and\nthen you can see there's the consolidated\n\n440\n00:20:46.376 --> 00:20:51.586\ntotal of the February, January, March and\nwe've got the 168 reflected here.\n\n441\n00:20:51.586 --> 00:20:55.293\nSo now it will do that updating,\nchange the source data,\n\n442\n00:20:55.293 --> 00:21:00.393\nchange is the consolidate feature of\ncommand as you put somewhere else whether\n\n443\n00:21:00.393 --> 00:21:04.968\nit's in another workbook,\nanother worksheet of the same workbook.\n\n444\n00:21:04.968 --> 00:21:09.623\nSo it could be kind of neat little\nway of being able to update\n\n445\n00:21:09.623 --> 00:21:13.715\nyour information using\nthis particular command.\n\n446\n00:21:13.715 --> 00:21:14.377\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n447\n00:21:14.377 --> 00:21:17.813\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so consolidate a way,\ngo ahead and organize your life.\n\n448\n00:21:17.813 --> 00:21:21.704\n[LAUGH] Go ahead and\nget it all in one place and again,\n\n449\n00:21:21.704 --> 00:21:26.952\nit's another way of you analyzing\nyour data, how you can go ahead and\n\n450\n00:21:26.952 --> 00:21:33.498\nmake those different thought process,\nof results of your data, your assessments.\n\n451\n00:21:33.498 --> 00:21:36.679\nHow you're gonna analyze your data,\nthere you go.\n\n452\n00:21:36.679 --> 00:21:37.713\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n453\n00:21:37.713 --> 00:21:39.310\n&gt;&gt; Make the decisions from there.\n\n454\n00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:42.501\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Vonne, great job,\nand she made it so interesting and\n\n455\n00:21:42.501 --> 00:21:44.422\nunderstandable to consolidate data.\n\n456\n00:21:44.422 --> 00:21:47.181\nAnd that's inside Excel 2016 Advanced,\nand make sure\n\n457\n00:21:47.181 --> 00:21:51.220\nyou watch all the episodes of Excel 2016\nAdvanced because you'll be glad you did.\n\n458\n00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:54.150\nAnd thank you for watching OfficePro TV.\n\n459\n00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:56.270\nRemember that good OfficePro\nis always learning.\n\n460\n00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:57.100\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n461\n00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:59.846\n&gt;&gt;

Yes.\n\n14\n00:00:36.367 --> 00:00:38.279\n&gt;&gt; Now, what is a scenario?\n\n15\n00:00:38.279 --> 00:00:41.249\nWell, it's just like what\nyou would think it would be.\n\n16\n00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:44.107\n[LAUGH] If you're talking\nabout in real life, okay.\n\n17\n00:00:44.107 --> 00:00:49.830\nSo if I have this scenario, if we\nwent ahead and increase our sales and\n\n18\n00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.285\nthen we decrease our personnel,\nwhat would happen?\n\n19\n00:00:54.285 --> 00:00:58.905\nWhat if we did x,\nwhat would the result be?\n\n20\n00:00:58.905 --> 00:00:59.884\nThose types of things.\n\n21\n00:00:59.884 --> 00:01:01.265\n&gt;&gt; So it's like cause and effect?\n\n22\n00:01:01.265 --> 00:01:03.182\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yes, exactly.\n\n23\n00:01:03.182 --> 00:01:07.495\nIt's like we're kinda playing out all the\ndifferent variables that might happen as\n\n24\n00:01:07.495 --> 00:01:08.841\njust one of those things.\n\n25\n00:01:08.841 --> 00:01:12.871\nNow we are talking about numbers, but you\ncould talk about this in regular life and\n\n26\n00:01:12.871 --> 00:01:14.985\neverything, like what if that happened?\n\n27\n00:01:14.985 --> 00:01:15.659\nWhat if this happened?\n\n28\n00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:16.337\nWhat if?\n\n29\n00:01:16.337 --> 00:01:18.417\nAnd then you get in a complete spiral,\n\n30\n00:01:18.417 --> 00:01:21.672\nand then you kinda end up in\na big heaping mush in the corner.\n\n31\n00:01:21.672 --> 00:01:22.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, no,\n\n32\n00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.007\nwe're not talking my emotions now, are we?\n\n33\n00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:26.854\n[LAUGH] But you know,\nwe got those ideas going.\n\n34\n00:01:26.854 --> 00:01:29.586\nIt's these are different\nvariables how can we change them.\n\n35\n00:01:29.586 --> 00:01:31.034\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; In the world of Excel,\n\n36\n00:01:31.034 --> 00:01:32.099\nwe have a lot of that,\n\n37\n00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:35.433\nespecially if you're somebody\nwho's planning out your budget.\n\n38\n00:01:35.433 --> 00:01:39.920\nOr you're in charge of the numbers, and\nwell if I could go ahead and decrease from\n\n39\n00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.751\nhere and increase from there,\nhow would that change my bottom line?\n\n40\n00:01:43.751 --> 00:01:44.304\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n41\n00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:48.625\nthat's what we're gonna go ahead and take\na look at here in this particular episode.\n\n42\n00:01:48.625 --> 00:01:49.291\n&gt;&gt; That's very exciting.\n\n43\n00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:49.901\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Let's go.\n\n44\n00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:54.152\n&gt;&gt; So why don't we go ahead and jump down\ninto our scenario's worksheet or workbook,\n\n45\n00:01:54.152 --> 00:01:54.892\nI should say.\n\n46\n00:01:54.892 --> 00:01:57.561\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And this particular worksheet what\n\n47\n00:01:57.561 --> 00:02:01.067\nwe're talking about is our monthly budget,\nright.\n\n48\n00:02:01.067 --> 00:02:05.297\nNow these are made up numbers here at out\nCats, our Christmas Cats Incorporated.\n\n49\n00:02:05.297 --> 00:02:07.652\nSo we have some personnel expenses.\n\n50\n00:02:07.652 --> 00:02:11.026\nAnd then we have our regular\noperating expenses and\n\n51\n00:02:11.026 --> 00:02:15.589\nthose combine we'll go ahead and\ncreate what is our monthly budget.\n\n52\n00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:18.383\nHow much money are we\nspending every month?\n\n53\n00:02:18.383 --> 00:02:21.064\nSo those are things that\nwe could say all right,\n\n54\n00:02:21.064 --> 00:02:24.967\nwell right now our bottom line\nis that we are $88,000 a month.\n\n55\n00:02:24.967 --> 00:02:27.399\nAnd sorry,\nI just zoomed in a little bit and\n\n56\n00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:29.776\nthen all my numbers went to dollar signs.\n\n57\n00:02:29.776 --> 00:02:32.877\nThat's just showing that I don't have\nenough space in that column to be able to\n\n58\n00:02:32.877 --> 00:02:33.782\ndisplay the numbers.\n\n59\n00:02:33.782 --> 00:02:37.244\nWe've seen that in some other episodes,\nbut just showing you in case you're like,\n\n60\n00:02:37.244 --> 00:02:38.435\nwhoa, what did you just do?\n\n61\n00:02:38.435 --> 00:02:39.121\nThat's what that was.\n\n62\n00:02:39.121 --> 00:02:39.680\n&gt;&gt; That's what you just did.\n\n63\n00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.263\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So we have some personnel and\nsome expenses, like I just said.\n\n64\n00:02:43.263 --> 00:02:44.556\nAnd so you can see that, and\n\n65\n00:02:44.556 --> 00:02:47.323\nthese are some basic formulas\nthat we've got right here.\n\n66\n00:02:47.323 --> 00:02:51.352\nWe've totaled up the sum of all the\ndifferent personnel like our managers and\n\n67\n00:02:51.352 --> 00:02:53.713\nsales and customer service and operations.\n\n68\n00:02:53.713 --> 00:02:55.548\nAnd then over here our expenses.\n\n69\n00:02:55.548 --> 00:02:58.690\nWe've totaled up our advertising,\nour rent, our utilities.\n\n70\n00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.955\nAnd our catnip, our complementary\ncatnip we give to all of our employees.\n\n71\n00:03:02.955 --> 00:03:07.003\nSo kind of we're actually working\nat a wonderful organization.\n\n72\n00:03:07.003 --> 00:03:09.630\nWhere we get free coffee everyday.\n\n73\n00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.505\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we do.\nIt's wonderful.\n\n74\n00:03:10.505 --> 00:03:11.435\n&gt;&gt; It's really nice.\n\n75\n00:03:11.435 --> 00:03:15.796\nSo that's one of those expenses\nthat I'm sure here at ITProTV,\n\n76\n00:03:15.796 --> 00:03:19.691\nthat Tim and Denise has,\ncoffee, and how much we spend.\n\n77\n00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:24.316\nSo it's catnip for our cat, that's\nwhere I pulled that analogy from there.\n\n78\n00:03:24.316 --> 00:03:25.627\n&gt;&gt; I like it, I like it very much.\n\n79\n00:03:25.627 --> 00:03:30.677\n&gt;&gt; And then we just went ahead and\nadded those two together to say the total\n\n80\n00:03:30.677 --> 00:03:36.510\npersonal cost and the total expenses equal\nout to our monthly operating budget.\n\n81\n00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.186\nSo just giving you kind of a quick\nexplanation about what's going on in here.\n\n82\n00:03:41.186 --> 00:03:43.558\nSo if our bottom line is $88000 and\n\n83\n00:03:43.558 --> 00:03:47.479\nyou're thinking okay what do we\nneed to do to kind of reduce costs?\n\n84\n00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:52.725\nLet's try to get this down to 88 or\n$80,000 or even lower, what are those\n\n85\n00:03:52.725 --> 00:03:57.684\nthings, what are some different scenarios\nthat we might be able to play out?\n\n86\n00:03:57.684 --> 00:04:03.318\nWell, one might be hey, if we could go\nahead and lower our personnel costs.\n\n87\n00:04:03.318 --> 00:04:05.282\nMaybe a manager will take a pay cut.\n\n88\n00:04:05.282 --> 00:04:06.676\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n89\n00:04:06.676 --> 00:04:08.961\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, okay, well you.\n\n90\n00:04:08.961 --> 00:04:10.171\nThese are scenarios, right?\n\n91\n00:04:10.171 --> 00:04:11.619\nWe're just playing things out.\n\n92\n00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:12.965\n&gt;&gt; When hogs are flying, there it goes.\n\n93\n00:04:12.965 --> 00:04:16.513\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So there oink, oink.\n\n94\n00:04:16.513 --> 00:04:19.547\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly right here.\n\n95\n00:04:19.547 --> 00:04:23.869\nBut we went ahead and took our operations\ncuz maybe we don't need a specific\n\n96\n00:04:23.869 --> 00:04:26.420\nposition anymore, all these type things.\n\n97\n00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.154\nIt always gets very sensitive when you\ntalk about personnel issues though,\n\n98\n00:04:29.154 --> 00:04:30.103\nlike cutting personnel.\n\n99\n00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:34.193\nBut this is the real world, so we have\nto go ahead and play those things out.\n\n100\n00:04:34.193 --> 00:04:34.924\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it happens.\n\n101\n00:04:34.924 --> 00:04:39.035\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but what about if we're\nlooking at a new building.\n\n102\n00:04:39.035 --> 00:04:41.723\nMaybe we're looking at reducing\nour rent because we're\n\n103\n00:04:41.723 --> 00:04:44.301\nin a really big space that\nmaybe we don't need as much.\n\n104\n00:04:44.301 --> 00:04:48.867\nIf we went ahead and moved out into\na different area of the city that has\n\n105\n00:04:48.867 --> 00:04:54.645\na lower rent, and we could take our\nrent down from $8,000 down to $3,000.\n\n106\n00:04:54.645 --> 00:04:57.807\nWell that would also reduce our utilities,\nand we could still go ahead and\n\n107\n00:04:57.807 --> 00:04:58.676\nafford the catnip.\n\n108\n00:04:58.676 --> 00:04:59.235\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n109\n00:04:59.235 --> 00:05:02.018\n&gt;&gt; All those different things\nthat we could ahead and do.\n\n110\n00:05:02.018 --> 00:05:04.762\nNow, these are all connected to a formula.\n\n111\n00:05:04.762 --> 00:05:07.987\nSo we could go ahead and start saying,\nwell, let's go ahead and\n\n112\n00:05:07.987 --> 00:05:10.219\nreduce some managers pay by $5,000.\n\n113\n00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:14.724\nAnd then we'll go ahead and\ntry to get operations down to 7500.\n\n114\n00:05:14.724 --> 00:05:19.101\nOkay, there you can see, we change that,\nit gets down about 80,000.\n\n115\n00:05:19.101 --> 00:05:23.800\nWell, if we also then reduce\nour rent to like 5,000.\n\n116\n00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.536\nAnd then we reduce our utilities to 1500,\n\n117\n00:05:26.536 --> 00:05:30.266\nagain you are seeing,\nperfect we could get it down that far.\n\n118\n00:05:30.266 --> 00:05:33.546\nBut then you start making\nall these changes, wait, so\n\n119\n00:05:33.546 --> 00:05:36.342\nwhat was our managers at,\nwhere was our rent?\n\n120\n00:05:36.342 --> 00:05:40.028\nI actually can't remember cuz\nyou start changing all these\n\n121\n00:05:40.028 --> 00:05:44.609\ndifferent numbers kind of hard coded\nif you wanna say, manually in here.\n\n122\n00:05:44.609 --> 00:05:47.093\nAnd then you can't remember\nwhere you go back to.\n\n123\n00:05:47.093 --> 00:05:50.767\nSo you start making duplicate\nworksheets and all kind of stuff, and\n\n124\n00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:53.163\nthen kind of just gets\na little unwielding.\n\n125\n00:05:53.163 --> 00:05:55.669\nWell-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I knew that was gonna happen.\n\n126\n00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:00.424\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There is a solution to that,\nand that is using one of the what if tools\n\n127\n00:06:00.424 --> 00:06:05.431\nor commands here within Excel that you\ncould start messing around with that.\n\n128\n00:06:05.431 --> 00:06:07.282\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the what if analysis stuff, yeah?\n\n129\n00:06:07.282 --> 00:06:09.865\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, cuz we've done that\nin some of the other ones, I mean,\n\n130\n00:06:09.865 --> 00:06:10.858\nin those other episodes.\n\n131\n00:06:10.858 --> 00:06:14.830\nAnd there's actually kind of a collection\nof tools within the what if.\n\n132\n00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.844\nWe have the goal seek, we have\nthe scenarios, and the data tables.\n\n133\n00:06:16.844 --> 00:06:17.690\nBecause we had done\nthe data tables together.\n\n134\n00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:18.735\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n135\n00:06:18.735 --> 00:06:21.400\n&gt;&gt; Where we saw all\nthese different options.\n\n136\n00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.956\nSo this is again, one of those,\nthe same, but different.\n\n137\n00:06:24.956 --> 00:06:28.727\nThe same idea in what tool is going\nto give you the best result for\n\n138\n00:06:28.727 --> 00:06:30.377\nwhat you're looking for.\n\n139\n00:06:30.377 --> 00:06:32.253\nSo that's what we're\ngoing to talk about here.\n\n140\n00:06:32.253 --> 00:06:37.013\nSo why don't we go ahead and\ntalk about the scenario command.\n\n141\n00:06:37.013 --> 00:06:40.621\nSo I have another worksheet\nthat is the exact same thing,\n\n142\n00:06:40.621 --> 00:06:44.088\nI just wanted to go ahead and\ngive different examples.\n\n143\n00:06:44.088 --> 00:06:48.124\nWe want to go ahead and\nstart making some different scenarios.\n\n144\n00:06:48.124 --> 00:06:50.801\nYes, I'm going to say that how\nmany times in this episode?\n\n145\n00:06:50.801 --> 00:06:51.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A lot.\n\n146\n00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.670\nSo we're going to come over here to our\nData tab, because our Data tab is where we\n\n147\n00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:00.114\nhave our what-if analysis tools or\ncommands right here.\n\n148\n00:07:00.114 --> 00:07:03.196\nAnd you can see that we\nhave a Scenario Manager.\n\n149\n00:07:03.196 --> 00:07:07.519\nSo it's gonna manage all the different\nscenarios we're going to play out here.\n\n150\n00:07:07.519 --> 00:07:12.043\nSo if I go ahead and select this,\nnotice this dialog box is going to\n\n151\n00:07:12.043 --> 00:07:16.254\ngive us the option to add\ndifferent scenarios right in here.\n\n152\n00:07:16.254 --> 00:07:19.223\nSo I'm going to click the Add button.\n\n153\n00:07:19.223 --> 00:07:22.054\nAnd we're going to say,\nwell what is this name?\n\n154\n00:07:22.054 --> 00:07:26.516\nWell for right now we're just going to do\na quick test because there's some things\n\n155\n00:07:26.516 --> 00:07:30.073\nthat are gonna come up right now\nthat are going to demonstrate some\n\n156\n00:07:30.073 --> 00:07:34.034\nof those tips and tricks that we\nprobably should do before we start this.\n\n157\n00:07:34.034 --> 00:07:35.908\nSo stay with me.\n\n158\n00:07:35.908 --> 00:07:37.571\nSo what am I going to do?\n\n159\n00:07:37.571 --> 00:07:42.336\nWell we talked about how we're going to\nbe changing out certain cells within this\n\n160\n00:07:42.336 --> 00:07:42.976\nexample.\n\n161\n00:07:42.976 --> 00:07:47.008\nWe wanted to change out some personnel and\nchange out some expenses.\n\n162\n00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:49.894\nSo that's what we have to right here,\ngo ahead and\n\n163\n00:07:49.894 --> 00:07:52.865\nput in the cells that we\nwant to go ahead and change.\n\n164\n00:07:52.865 --> 00:07:55.930\nAnd well I'm gonna delete whatever's\nin there for right now and\n\n165\n00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:58.322\nget my flashing cursor in\nthat particular field.\n\n166\n00:07:58.322 --> 00:08:02.568\nCome up to my worksheet, and\nthen select the range of cells,\n\n167\n00:08:02.568 --> 00:08:08.090\ncuz all of these cells, I do need to\nchange in the different scenarios.\n\n168\n00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:12.740\nAnd then, there's another group that I'd\nlike to kind of play with and In here and\n\n169\n00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:15.910\nwe take F what is that 2 through F5.\n\n170\n00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:18.470\nSo I selected those.\n\n171\n00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:24.160\nSo its got my arrange of selves right\nhere that it's going to remember and\n\n172\n00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.210\nthat's where it's actually I want,\nyou know what?\n\n173\n00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:28.110\nI just realized.\n\n174\n00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:29.260\nI'm like, I caught myself.\n\n175\n00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.520\nCuz I'm like, and\nit's only selecting one range.\n\n176\n00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.280\nYou know what I did?\n\n177\n00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.575\nI forgot to hold\nthe wonderful Control key.\n\n178\n00:08:35.575 --> 00:08:38.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I forgot to say I want both of them.\n\n179\n00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.510\nIt actually just replaced\nthat range of cells.\n\n180\n00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:41.130\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n181\n00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:41.690\n&gt;&gt; Teachable moment.\n\n182\n00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:42.650\nI meant to-\n&gt;&gt; Teachable moment.\n\n183\n00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:43.330\n&gt;&gt; Do that.\n\n184\n00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:44.590\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Not really.\n\n185\n00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:45.960\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So we'll go ahead and\n\n186\n00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:46.940\nselect those.\n\n187\n00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:50.400\nHold the Ctrl key down and\nthen we go ahead.\n\n188\n00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:50.950\nThere we go.\n\n189\n00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:51.700\nThat's what I'm looking for.\n\n190\n00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:52.440\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n191\n00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.950\n&gt;&gt; I was looking for the running ends.\n\n192\n00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:58.330\nI was look to see are these the cells that\nI'm going to want to start manipulating\n\n193\n00:08:58.330 --> 00:08:59.720\nwithin my scenario?\n\n194\n00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.710\nI've got them.\n\n195\n00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:03.090\nI'm good.\nYou can always make a comment on this.\n\n196\n00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:04.935\nAs to why I'm doing this.\n\n197\n00:09:04.935 --> 00:09:07.390\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; It's always good to comment your,\n\n198\n00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:08.270\nwhat you're doing as you go.\n\n199\n00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:09.650\nBut for now, let's just go ahead and\n\n200\n00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:14.240\njust have it that it was created\non this particular date.\n\n201\n00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:19.220\nWe'll talk about these in a little bit,\nthe prevent changes and hide.\n\n202\n00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:23.290\nBut a quick summary right there,\nif you put on a hide or prevent changes,\n\n203\n00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:26.620\nit doesn't make any difference\nunless you protect the worksheet.\n\n204\n00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.590\nAnd we talk about that\nin document security or\n\n205\n00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:31.060\nworkbook security within\nthis particular series.\n\n206\n00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:31.990\nSo definitely check that out.\n\n207\n00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:37.220\nBut it is connected to, you gotta\nprotect the worksheet before this would\n\n208\n00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:41.850\nbe hidden or prevented or\nlocked down from people doing changes.\n\n209\n00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:43.120\nSo just, or there!\n\n210\n00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.200\nI just went ahead and explained it.\n\n211\n00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.758\nSo, now you know what\nthose two checkboxes are.\n\n212\n00:09:45.758 --> 00:09:46.840\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now we know!\n\n213\n00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.960\n&gt;&gt; Now I'm gonna go ahead and click OK.\n\n214\n00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.930\nAnd we've got our scenarios.\n\n215\n00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:56.180\nAnd you can see it says, enter the values\nfor each one of the changing cells because\n\n216\n00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:59.010\nwe said these are the different\nones that I want to go ahead and\n\n217\n00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:02.180\nplay around with changing values out and\nthat's great.\n\n218\n00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:06.360\nNow the biggest thing I want to\nshow in this particular step right\n\n219\n00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.050\nhere is that it says B2, B3, B4.\n\n220\n00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:12.380\nI don't know what those are.\n\n221\n00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:16.950\nWell then I kinda have to remember and\nreference, okay, B2, B2.\n\n222\n00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:19.360\nWell that's talking about managers.\n\n223\n00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.920\nB3, B3, okay, that's sales.\n\n224\n00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:27.210\nWouldn't it be so much easier if those\nsaid managers, sales, customer services?\n\n225\n00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:32.783\nSo it's actually using the labels\nof what that value really is.\n\n226\n00:10:32.783 --> 00:10:33.587\n&gt;&gt; If only there was a way.\n\n227\n00:10:33.587 --> 00:10:35.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If only there was a way.\n\n228\n00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:38.180\n&gt;&gt; Guess what?\n\n229\n00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:38.760\n&gt;&gt; Yehey.\n\n230\n00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:44.590\n&gt;&gt; There is, I got the answers at least\nin this episode today so I've got them.\n\n231\n00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:51.040\nSo let me go ahead and cancel out and\nshow you why using named ranges is gonna\n\n232\n00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:55.600\nhelp you so much when you are starting to\nuse these different scenarios because then\n\n233\n00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:00.810\nyou can actually have words that\nare identifying your values rather than\n\n234\n00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:06.620\njust the cell references so that's\nbig tip number one, use named ranges.\n\n235\n00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:10.350\nNow, I have them over here and\njust to show you, like right now,\n\n236\n00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:16.440\nif I zoom in on here,\nB2 it is managers and B3 is sales.\n\n237\n00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.475\nNow, this is something that we talk\nabout in our Named Ranges episode.\n\n238\n00:11:19.475 --> 00:11:23.295\nSo if you want a little bit more\ninformation on all of the different\n\n239\n00:11:23.295 --> 00:11:27.125\nfacets of using Named Ranges\ndefinitely check that one out.\n\n240\n00:11:27.125 --> 00:11:32.622\nBut just as a quick reminder there is\na fun little thing that you can do to use\n\n241\n00:11:32.622 --> 00:11:39.052\nthe labels that are next to your values,\nto be able to name them really quickly.\n\n242\n00:11:39.052 --> 00:11:40.132\nAnd this is pretty cool.\n\n243\n00:11:40.132 --> 00:11:41.052\nSo let just show you.\n\n244\n00:11:41.052 --> 00:11:43.042\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nselect this one right here.\n\n245\n00:11:43.042 --> 00:11:44.842\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n&gt;&gt; I'm also gonna go ahead and\n\n246\n00:11:44.842 --> 00:11:46.090\nselect this one.\n\n247\n00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:50.440\nAnd this show you that we have\nthe value of 20000, 15000.\n\n248\n00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:56.180\nThe label that would be that\nname is to the left of it.\n\n249\n00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.250\nSo you can use this super awesome.\n\n250\n00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:59.950\nI love this command.\n\n251\n00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:02.880\nThis command in the formulas\nthat create from selection.\n\n252\n00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:07.190\nWe're going to automatically\ngenerate names based on the row or\n\n253\n00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:08.990\ncolumn that you're trying to pull from.\n\n254\n00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:13.730\nYou click that, I have from left column\nthat's already selected right now,\n\n255\n00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:16.430\nkind of seize that and\nI had already done this before.\n\n256\n00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:17.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So that's probably another reason why,\n\n257\n00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:21.680\nbut it's gonna use that left\ncolumn between these two tables,\n\n258\n00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.200\nif you wanna say the rows and columns.\n\n259\n00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.430\nAnd then it uses it to go ahead and\ncreate.\n\n260\n00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:27.460\nThere you go.\n\n261\n00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:31.500\nLook at B2 is managers,\nsales and then customer service.\n\n262\n00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.280\nAnything with a space,\nit will go ahead and\n\n263\n00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:37.850\nput an underscore, because spaces\nare not allowed in the named ranges.\n\n264\n00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:41.730\n&gt;&gt; Lovely little trick, if you-- that\nis in review from our other episodes.\n\n265\n00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:42.610\nLike I said check it out.\n\n266\n00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:47.120\nAll right, so I've already done\nthis in this particular worksheet.\n\n267\n00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:51.560\nAnd even so far as to go ahead and\ntake the personnel totals and\n\n268\n00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.580\nthe expense totals.\n\n269\n00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.430\nAnd in this particular form,\n\n270\n00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:58.760\nyou could see personnel plus\nexpenses in the formula bar.\n\n271\n00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:03.420\nSo it makes it a lot easier\nto know what you're doing in\n\n272\n00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:07.068\nyour calculations,\nif you use named ranges.\n\n273\n00:13:07.068 --> 00:13:09.290\nSo now let's go back to that scenario and\n\n274\n00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:14.480\ndo this the right way now that\nwe have some named ranges.\n\n275\n00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.550\nWe're going to come over to the data\ntab we're gonna go to the what if\n\n276\n00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:21.650\nanalysis we're gonna go\nto our scenario manager,\n\n277\n00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:24.431\nI started getting lost like\nwhich one are we doing again.\n\n278\n00:13:24.431 --> 00:13:25.515\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n279\n00:13:25.515 --> 00:13:27.203\n&gt;&gt; So we're doing our scenarios and\n\n280\n00:13:27.203 --> 00:13:29.510\nwe're going to add our scenario.\n\n281\n00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:33.100\nThis is tip number two\nin creating scenarios.\n\n282\n00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:35.420\nYou always wanna set a base.\n\n283\n00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:40.140\nSet your baseline as to what everything\nyou have right now that you're looking at.\n\n284\n00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:43.760\n$88,000 is our current operating budget,\nso\n\n285\n00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:49.030\nyou wanna make sure you have like go\nback to the beginning as as option.\n\n286\n00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.290\nSo, I'm going to name this current.\n\n287\n00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:55.950\nYou can name it base, start whatever\nyou want it's completely up to you.\n\n288\n00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:58.815\nNow, we're gonna go ahead and we select\nour cells that we want to change in our\n\n289\n00:13:58.815 --> 00:14:04.257\nscenario which would be B 2 through B 5,\nhold that control key.\n\n290\n00:14:04.257 --> 00:14:07.265\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Come over here [INAUDIBLE] control at.\n\n291\n00:14:07.265 --> 00:14:11.790\nNow I've both those ranges as\nthe sales that I want to manipulate.\n\n292\n00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:12.730\nI click okay.\n\n293\n00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:13.510\nAnd there you go.\n\n294\n00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:14.400\nLook at that.\n\n295\n00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.250\nNow this makes a lot more sense for\n\n296\n00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:20.700\nus that I can manager sales,\nall the different named sales in there.\n\n297\n00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:21.380\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n298\n00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:24.390\n&gt;&gt; And this is the one remember when we're\nstarting a base, so we're gonna stop.\n\n299\n00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:27.180\nWe're gonna say whatever's\nin there right now, keep it.\n\n300\n00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.120\nSo we're gonna click okay.\n\n301\n00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.000\nAnd then we've got our current.\n\n302\n00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.890\nCool, we've got a baseline.\n\n303\n00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:35.660\nNow I wanna go ahead and\nmake another scenario.\n\n304\n00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:39.220\nSo let's add, and the scenario\nthat we're gonna do with this one,\n\n305\n00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:41.296\nis we're going to lower\nour personnel costs.\n\n306\n00:14:41.296 --> 00:14:45.830\nOkay, person, person,\nI always spell this wrong.\n\n307\n00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:47.470\nPersonnel, perfect.\n\n308\n00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.290\nWe're still changing the same cells.\n\n309\n00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:50.920\nWe don't have to change the range,\n\n310\n00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.790\nbecause it's remembering that\nfrom last time that we're good.\n\n311\n00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:57.240\nAnd again, making comments along the way,\nprobably a good thing.\n\n312\n00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.600\nFor demonstration purposes,\nI'm just gonna go ahead and move on.\n\n313\n00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:05.200\nSo now our scenario for\nhere would be let's go ahead, and\n\n314\n00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:09.130\nI'm gonna zoom in, we wanna try to get\nthose manager salaries down a little bit,\n\n315\n00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:12.230\nso we're gonna go ahead and\nput them down to 20,000.\n\n316\n00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:14.810\nWe're going to then,\nwe're gonna keep our sales up.\n\n317\n00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:17.300\nWe gotta keep our customer service but\nwe could probably go ahead and\n\n318\n00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:20.500\nget our operating cost\nto about says $6000.\n\n319\n00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:25.140\nAnd so, this is scenario one or\ntwo whichever what number we're on,\n\n320\n00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:27.303\nlowering the personnel costs.\n\n321\n00:15:27.303 --> 00:15:30.657\nSo I went ahead and\ndid that, I click okay, and\n\n322\n00:15:30.657 --> 00:15:33.335\nnow I have it in my list of scenarios.\n\n323\n00:15:33.335 --> 00:15:35.650\nLet's go ahead and make one more.\n\n324\n00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:40.890\nWe're gonna add, and\nwe're going to say lower expenses.\n\n325\n00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:43.370\nActually, let's do it a little bit better.\n\n326\n00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:45.840\nWe're gonna say change location.\n\n327\n00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.941\nCuz that was the whole for\nrebuilding and everything.\n\n328\n00:15:49.941 --> 00:15:51.500\nSo we're going to now.\n\n329\n00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.373\n&gt;&gt; Cuz the width is too darn high.\n\n330\n00:15:53.373 --> 00:15:54.847\n&gt;&gt; Those words just keep on going up.\n\n331\n00:15:54.847 --> 00:15:58.948\nSo, we're gonna move out to the suburbs or\nwhatever.\n\n332\n00:15:58.948 --> 00:15:59.754\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Whatever.\n\n333\n00:15:59.754 --> 00:16:01.267\n&gt;&gt; So, I click OK.\n\n334\n00:16:01.267 --> 00:16:06.549\nAnd so in this sense, we want to change\nour rent, because we think that we found\n\n335\n00:16:06.549 --> 00:16:12.575\nthis building, that instead of $8,500,\nwe're looking at about $3,000.\n\n336\n00:16:12.575 --> 00:16:16.319\nWe know that our utilities would go\ndown because it's a smaller space.\n\n337\n00:16:16.319 --> 00:16:17.343\n&gt;&gt; Smaller building, yeah.\n\n338\n00:16:17.343 --> 00:16:20.276\n&gt;&gt; It's got green roofing and\nall that kind of fun stuff.\n\n339\n00:16:20.276 --> 00:16:23.988\nSo we'll try say that we'll\nget that down to 1,250, okay?\n\n340\n00:16:23.988 --> 00:16:25.897\nSo that's what we've determined.\n\n341\n00:16:25.897 --> 00:16:27.401\nWe click OK.\n\n342\n00:16:27.401 --> 00:16:31.529\nSo now I have this different scenarios and\nthe cool thing is, now that you've got\n\n343\n00:16:31.529 --> 00:16:35.854\nthem added in to it, that like, what would\nit look like if we lowered our personnel?\n\n344\n00:16:35.854 --> 00:16:39.301\nYou click on the scenario,\non the scenario manager down here\n\n345\n00:16:39.301 --> 00:16:43.097\nin the show button you click it and\nthen it shows all of the changes.\n\n346\n00:16:43.097 --> 00:16:46.435\nSo, cool I can look at that as $79,000.\n\n347\n00:16:46.435 --> 00:16:48.387\nLet's look at it if we\nchange the locations.\n\n348\n00:16:48.387 --> 00:16:52.013\nThat's where the personnel goes back up,\nbut the expenses go back down.\n\n349\n00:16:52.013 --> 00:16:52.994\nLet's look at that one.\n\n350\n00:16:52.994 --> 00:16:55.554\nWe show that, and okay, cool.\n\n351\n00:16:55.554 --> 00:16:58.631\nIf we can get those managers to come\ndown on their prices, [LAUGH] okay,\n\n352\n00:16:58.631 --> 00:17:00.211\nwe'll probably go ahead and move.\n\n353\n00:17:00.211 --> 00:17:01.257\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n354\n00:17:01.257 --> 00:17:03.010\nwe've got these different\nscenarios right here.\n\n355\n00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:07.595\nSo as you can see, it kind of keeps track\nof all the different what ifs that you\n\n356\n00:17:07.595 --> 00:17:12.036\nmight have by changing a value, and\nyou can kind of store all in one place,\n\n357\n00:17:12.036 --> 00:17:15.926\nand so that's really neat to be\nable to kind of go back and forth.\n\n358\n00:17:15.926 --> 00:17:18.213\nBut, remember,\njust like I said you gotta have a base.\n\n359\n00:17:18.213 --> 00:17:19.386\nSo I'm gonna go back to current.\n\n360\n00:17:19.386 --> 00:17:23.529\nAnd that's one of those,\nif I click OK, let me just show you,\n\n361\n00:17:23.529 --> 00:17:26.183\nif I close this, it keeps everything.\n\n362\n00:17:26.183 --> 00:17:29.330\nAnd there's not really like an undo or\nanything, here.\n\n363\n00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:35.632\nIt's just like a stored scenario that you\nhave to go back to say, now show this one.\n\n364\n00:17:35.632 --> 00:17:39.958\nSo just always remember that, if you're\nlike, if you're trying to play around with\n\n365\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:43.805\nthis, you might wanna, this is something\nthat you're always looking as,\n\n366\n00:17:43.805 --> 00:17:45.573\nthese need to be our real numbers?\n\n367\n00:17:45.573 --> 00:17:48.713\nYou might wanna make a copy\nof your worksheet before and\n\n368\n00:17:48.713 --> 00:17:52.748\nkinda play around with that and\nmake sure you title it like scenarios.\n\n369\n00:17:52.748 --> 00:17:55.025\nAnd that way your real\nnumbers aren't changed but\n\n370\n00:17:55.025 --> 00:17:57.093\nyou always have that\ncurrent to go back with.\n\n371\n00:17:57.093 --> 00:17:59.156\nSo just kind of keep that in mind.\n\n372\n00:17:59.156 --> 00:18:01.838\nSo I'm gonna bring that\nback to our current,\n\n373\n00:18:01.838 --> 00:18:07.008\nwe're gonna show that because we are at\n$88,000 in our operating cost, okay.\n\n374\n00:18:07.008 --> 00:18:11.424\nSo few more things that I wanted\nto show you in scenarios,\n\n375\n00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:16.585\nI'm gonna go over back to our\nmonthly budget, okay, there we go.\n\n376\n00:18:16.585 --> 00:18:20.429\nSo in this monthly budget, cuz we did use\nthis to go ahead and make some names.\n\n377\n00:18:20.429 --> 00:18:21.890\nSo we've got that.\n\n378\n00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:24.829\nThe other thing I wanted to show\nyou is different worksheet,\n\n379\n00:18:24.829 --> 00:18:26.857\nlet's go back to that Scenario Manager.\n\n380\n00:18:26.857 --> 00:18:30.785\nNo scenarios,\nscenarios are worksheet dependent,\n\n381\n00:18:30.785 --> 00:18:34.163\nthey are individually\nstored in each worksheet.\n\n382\n00:18:34.163 --> 00:18:37.619\nSo yeah I've got scenarios,\nbut on another sheet.\n\n383\n00:18:37.619 --> 00:18:38.923\nSo that's kinda good, and\n\n384\n00:18:38.923 --> 00:18:41.541\nit kinda goes back to what I\nwas saying of making a copy.\n\n385\n00:18:41.541 --> 00:18:45.517\nSo you can go ahead and play out\nmultiple scenarios if you wanted to.\n\n386\n00:18:45.517 --> 00:18:50.019\nSo for example on this monthly\nbudget I might go ahead and say,\n\n387\n00:18:50.019 --> 00:18:51.760\nlower catnip, right?\n\n388\n00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.157\nWe're gonna try and\ncut back on that catnip.\n\n389\n00:18:54.157 --> 00:18:56.845\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay,\n\n488\n00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:32.315\nif we don't increase other things, okay.\n\n489\n00:23:32.315 --> 00:23:33.701\nI think I'm looking at it like\n\n490\n00:23:33.701 --> 00:23:35.045\na $70 increase so,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n491\n00:23:35.045 --> 00:23:38.341\n&gt;&gt; I guess it's not too much, but\nstill, increase is an increase.\n\n492\n00:23:38.341 --> 00:23:39.077\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n493\n00:23:39.077 --> 00:23:40.784\n&gt;&gt; So\nthat's what we've got going on with that.\n\n494\n00:23:40.784 --> 00:23:44.398\nAnd just really quickly to show you\nthe difference of what it looks like in\n\n495\n00:23:44.398 --> 00:23:45.179\na pivot table.\n\n496\n00:23:45.179 --> 00:23:47.621\nSo I'll come back over here.\n\n497\n00:23:47.621 --> 00:23:51.617\nAnd I'll go back to my What If and\nI go to my scenario manager, and\n\n498\n00:23:51.617 --> 00:23:55.248\nthen I go to summary and\nI choose Pivot Table and I click OK.\n\n499\n00:23:55.248 --> 00:23:58.391\nNotice it's just going to go ahead and\ngive it to me in a pivot table.\n\n500\n00:23:58.391 --> 00:24:00.204\nIt doesn't kind of break it down-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n501\n00:24:00.204 --> 00:24:03.120\n&gt;&gt; With all of the different levels,\nif you want to say.\n\n502\n00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:06.316\nBut then you can sort by them, and\nchange a few different things.\n\n503\n00:24:06.316 --> 00:24:10.747\nNotice that it is kinda showing,\neven back in here, see, it says C12?\n\n504\n00:24:10.747 --> 00:24:11.276\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n505\n00:24:11.276 --> 00:24:12.528\n&gt;&gt; It's just using that reference.\n\n506\n00:24:12.528 --> 00:24:17.607\nI probably should have, or could, go back\nand give this particular cell a name,\n\n507\n00:24:17.607 --> 00:24:21.283\nlike operating budget and\nthat way it can kind of give you.\n\n508\n00:24:21.283 --> 00:24:22.669\n&gt;&gt; Or Bob.\n\n509\n00:24:22.669 --> 00:24:25.080\n&gt;&gt; Or Bob, you can do that.\n\n510\n00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.050\nYou can also just change\nit from right here.\n\n511\n00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:30.468\nSo you can just go ahead and\ndo operating cost right from your summary.\n\n512\n00:24:30.468 --> 00:24:35.097\nYou don't have to pre-think\nabout naming that resulting\n\n513\n00:24:35.097 --> 00:24:38.694\ncell beforehand everything is changeable.\n\n514\n00:24:38.694 --> 00:24:39.633\n&gt;&gt; That's wonderful.\n\n515\n00:24:39.633 --> 00:24:40.646\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty neat.\n\n516\n00:24:40.646 --> 00:24:44.245\nIt's just another way for\nyou to do that analysis,\n\n517\n00:24:44.245 --> 00:24:49.363\nday analysis of where are we,\nwhere are we going, what if this happens?\n\n518\n00:24:49.363 --> 00:24:53.800\nSo using the scenarios might\nbe one way that you can do it.\n\n519\n00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:58.203\nBut like I said, there also is the data\ntables that gives you just like a range of\n\n520\n00:24:58.203 --> 00:25:02.557\noptions, and we're also gonna talk\nabout the goal seek within this series.\n\n521\n00:25:02.557 --> 00:25:05.971\nSo those are all those\noptions in that drop down.\n\n522\n00:25:05.971 --> 00:25:08.690\nI just know one of those is like\nwell why wouldn't I just use that,\n\n523\n00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:10.084\nor why wouldn't I just use this?\n\n524\n00:25:10.084 --> 00:25:12.573\nWell that's because there's\ndifferent tools for different jobs.\n\n525\n00:25:12.573 --> 00:25:13.181\n&gt;&gt; Options.\n\n526\n00:25:13.181 --> 00:25:17.451\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so sometimes like some people\njust like I always do it this way, or\n\n527\n00:25:17.451 --> 00:25:18.760\nI always do it that way.\n\n528\n00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:22.675\nYou'll be able to choose but at least\nnow you know what options you have-\n\n529\n00:25:22.675 --> 00:25:24.349\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n530\n00:25:24.349 --> 00:25:26.227\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; Vonne, you did a wonderful job.\n\n531\n00:25:26.227 --> 00:25:29.277\nScenarios, and\nthis is Excel 2016 Advanced.\n\n532\n00:25:29.277 --> 00:25:32.136\nMake sure you watch every single\nepisode of Excel 2016 Advanced,\n\n533\n00:25:32.136 --> 00:25:35.042\nbecause we'll be glad to and\nto learn a whole bunch of things and\n\n534\n00:25:35.042 --> 00:25:36.997\nmaybe laugh a couple of times,\nyou never know.\n\n535\n00:25:36.997 --> 00:25:38.956\nAnd thank you for watching OfficeProTV.\n\n536\n00:25:38.956 --> 00:25:40.835\nRemember a good OfficePro\nis always learning.\n\n537\n00:25:40.835 --> 00:25:42.582\nI'm Zach Memos,\n&gt;&gt;

Hi, good.\n&gt;&gt; Good to see you.\n\n11\n00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:34.800\n&gt;&gt; Good to see you too.\n\n12\n00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.520\n&gt;&gt; Let's do it.\n\n13\n00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.885\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nSo it's goal seek.\n\n14\n00:00:36.885 --> 00:00:40.255\nIt's almost like what goals\nshall you seek or whatever?\n\n15\n00:00:40.255 --> 00:00:42.495\nI can't even get the words out but\nit sounds like some-\n\n16\n00:00:42.495 --> 00:00:44.185\n&gt;&gt; You shall seek the goals!\n\n17\n00:00:44.185 --> 00:00:45.082\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly!\n\n18\n00:00:45.082 --> 00:00:49.437\nI feel like it's some type of science\nfiction, like a Star Wars-y type of thing\n\n19\n00:00:49.437 --> 00:00:54.660\nthat's happening there like Yoda's\nsitting there saying, Goal Seek there.\n\n20\n00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.551\n&gt;&gt; Seek the goal, you will.\n\n21\n00:00:55.551 --> 00:01:00.071\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, but it really\nis exactly how it sounds is that we\n\n22\n00:01:00.071 --> 00:01:03.470\nhave a goal and\nwe need to seek out the answer.\n\n23\n00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.320\nAnd it's really more of like backwards\nengineering, if you wanna say.\n\n24\n00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.020\nAnd I will say that this is something that\nI'm sure maybe, if any of you all have\n\n25\n00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.520\nbeen in school, it's like all\nright towards end of the semester.\n\n26\n00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.990\nYou have that last test,\nyou know you need it.\n\n27\n00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.130\nIf you just get a B, if I could just get\nlike a 92 or whatever a B is nowadays,\n\n28\n00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.220\nwhat is the score that I need to get\non this last test to be able to get it?\n\n29\n00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.894\nAnd it's usually like, you need 125.\n\n30\n00:01:29.894 --> 00:01:31.708\nIt's like okay, so I'm not getting a B!\n\n31\n00:01:31.708 --> 00:01:33.820\n[LAUGH] And you would have to\nactually take there like okay,\n\n32\n00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.180\nlet's put this number in,\nno that's not it.\n\n33\n00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.160\nThat number, that number, and\nI would manually go ahead and\n\n34\n00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.360\nsit there with my calculator.\n\n35\n00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.740\nAnd try to configure what do I need\nto get on that last test to be\n\n36\n00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.360\nable to get my final grade as\nto whatever it needs to be.\n\n37\n00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.870\nSo, I don't know if any of\nyou all have ever done that.\n\n38\n00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.332\nI know I've done that a lot.\n\n39\n00:01:53.332 --> 00:01:55.694\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, I've never done that.\n\n40\n00:01:55.694 --> 00:01:57.230\n&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] exactly.\n\n41\n00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.520\nSo it's exactly what we're\ngoing to use goal seek for.\n\n42\n00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.730\nAnd this is one of those, it's like I've\njust recently done something like this and\n\n43\n00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.430\nwhy didn't I just use the goal seek?\n\n44\n00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.569\nforgot about it, honestly.\n\n45\n00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.817\nSo hopefully you are in this\nscenario now that you'll be like\n\n46\n00:02:11.817 --> 00:02:14.013\nI know what this is now and\nI'm gonna use it.\n\n47\n00:02:14.013 --> 00:02:17.029\nSo why don't I go ahead and\ngive you an example.\n\n48\n00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:21.985\nSo, instead of talking about\ntests we have average sales, so\n\n49\n00:02:21.985 --> 00:02:24.570\nwe have some salespeople here.\n\n50\n00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.240\nWe have Daniel, Alice, Bob and Zach, okay?\n\n51\n00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.890\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah.\n\n52\n00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.000\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Darn Zach,\n\n53\n00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.860\nhe's a-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n54\n00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.300\n&gt;&gt; Lowest guy on the totem pole.\n\n55\n00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.120\n&gt;&gt; I don't know,\nhe's doing pretty good right now.\n\n56\n00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, leave it alone.\n\n57\n00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:34.332\nYeah, you're right.\n\n58\n00:02:34.332 --> 00:02:36.587\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're doing good right now, so\n\n59\n00:02:36.587 --> 00:02:39.330\nyou could see that we're\nselling mouse toys.\n\n60\n00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.330\nSo Christmas cats, toy mouse sales.\n\n61\n00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.100\nSo the amount of toys you're going\nto be selling every month, or\n\n62\n00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.480\nactually, I guess quarter, I've got here.\n\n63\n00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.090\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n64\n00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.520\n&gt;&gt; So I've got here that our average goal,\nand there's nothing fancy about this,\n\n65\n00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.990\nit's just stating that our goal is you\nneed to have an average sale of 40.\n\n66\n00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.400\nOkay, well, right now you could see\nthat the average would be you add up\n\n67\n00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.300\nall of the values and\ndivide by how many you have.\n\n68\n00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.270\nBut to show you over here\nin this particular cell,\n\n69\n00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.780\nis that we've got a formula.\n\n70\n00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.740\nThat it says that we have an average\nof averaging out B4 through E4 which\n\n71\n00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.200\nmeans these figures right here,\nthe quarters 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n72\n00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.630\nNow 4 is left blank on purpose for\n\n73\n00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.730\nthis particular example,\nto say we haven't gotten into Q4 yet.\n\n74\n00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.760\nAnd so now, we're going to have to\ndetermine well, right now Daniel's\n\n75\n00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.140\nsales are about averaging right now\nbetween the three quarters at 32.\n\n76\n00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.310\nWell, he's gotta get up to 40.\n\n77\n00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.655\nThat's your quota or whatever.\n\n78\n00:03:39.655 --> 00:03:40.190\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n79\n00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:46.120\n&gt;&gt; So what does Daniel need to do in\norder to get an average of 40, right?\n\n80\n00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.680\nNow this is tied,\nthis particular cell right here,\n\n81\n00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.170\nthe quarter 4 of Daniel,\nis tied into this particular formula.\n\n82\n00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.430\nSo if I typed in 20, and\nthen just hit Tab, you can see,\n\n83\n00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.800\nwell, it went ahead and\ncalculated because that's what it is.\n\n84\n00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.730\nAll right, well 29's not gonna do it,\nso then we do okay, what about 30?\n\n85\n00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.821\nNope, and then we go 40?\n\n86\n00:04:05.821 --> 00:04:08.507\nGoodness, he's gotta get up there, 50?\n\n87\n00:04:08.507 --> 00:04:14.133\nAnd this is those things that I would\nstart doing with my test scores,\n\n88\n00:04:14.133 --> 00:04:16.076\nlike okay well 70?\n\n89\n00:04:16.076 --> 00:04:22.567\nWow, okay at least now at 41 but what's\nthe minimum I need to get to get 40?\n\n90\n00:04:22.567 --> 00:04:25.898\nSo, you just sit here and play with\nthe numbers over and over and over,\n\n91\n00:04:25.898 --> 00:04:28.120\nuntil you finally oop, yup, that's right.\n\n92\n00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.870\n&gt;&gt; That can take a long time.\n\n93\n00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.980\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nSo that's like a backward\n\n94\n00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:31.640\nengineering of like.\n\n95\n00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.700\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; Of like, what do I need to get to?\n\n96\n00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.470\nWell, this is where you\ncould just go ahead and\n\n97\n00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.390\nuse the goal seek in Excel to do that.\n\n98\n00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.980\nSo, if we were here for Daniel,\nwe're gonna go over here to Settings.\n\n99\n00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.000\nIt really doesn't matter where our\ncursor is to begin with honestly,\n\n100\n00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.610\nbecause it's all within the dialogue box.\n\n101\n00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.120\nSo we're gonna go over to our data and\nthis is, again, part of that what-if\n\n102\n00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.980\nanalysis that we have of the scenarios,\nand the data table, and the goal seek.\n\n103\n00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.230\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwell, do the Goal Seek now.\n\n104\n00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:09.660\nAnd now we're going to Set Cell,\nwhich cell do I want to change?\n\n105\n00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.200\nI wanna change this cell,\nthe Average Sales.\n\n106\n00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.970\nIt needs to get to a value of 40.\n\n107\n00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:24.060\nNow, do notice something here,\nthat you're hard coding this number.\n\n108\n00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.695\n&gt;&gt; The two value, I can't put it like\nas a cell reference of there's 40.\n\n109\n00:05:27.695 --> 00:05:28.850\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n110\n00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.940\n&gt;&gt; You have to manually type\nin the value that you want\n\n111\n00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.240\nthe average sale, sorry,\nmoving my mouse around too much over here.\n\n112\n00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.040\nThis cell right here,\nG4 average sales of Daniel,\n\n113\n00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:46.840\nneeds to be set to a value of\n40 by changing which cell?\n\n114\n00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:47.770\nThis one.\n\n115\n00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:48.410\n&gt;&gt;

Right.\n&gt;&gt; So that would be B10, we click okay.\n\n226\n00:09:53.004 --> 00:09:58.140\nAll right, I need, it looks like, 13,750\n\n227\n00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:03.412\nunits to be produced to get\nit to a $2 cost per toy.\n\n228\n00:10:03.412 --> 00:10:05.342\nSo, and as-\n&gt;&gt; So quick.\n\n229\n00:10:05.342 --> 00:10:06.943\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you could-\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n230\n00:10:06.943 --> 00:10:09.180\n&gt;&gt; Go ahead and do a different analysis.\n\n231\n00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:12.920\nLike, okay, well, what if I change\nthe labor, that kind of stuff.\n\n232\n00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:17.840\nSo I mean you can go through, but again,\nit's pinpoint and it's one specific thing.\n\n233\n00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.320\nThis value gets changed this,\nbut it has to be, and\n\n234\n00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.555\nI don't know if I've mentioned this,\nlike it has to be part of a formula.\n\n235\n00:10:23.555 --> 00:10:25.870\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n&gt;&gt; Like this result right here.\n\n236\n00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:27.580\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That I want to set that value to, so\n\n237\n00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:31.650\nit has to be part of a formula\nthat is connected to other\n\n238\n00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:33.580\nones that you're changing.\n\n239\n00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.280\nNow this one right here,\nI mean this is part of the formula.\n\n240\n00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.855\nYou can see that it's B7 divided by B10.\n\n241\n00:10:38.855 --> 00:10:39.520\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n242\n00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.940\n&gt;&gt; So if they're not connected and\nyou don't have a formula,\n\n243\n00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:44.995\nthis goal seek doesn't really work, okay?\n\n244\n00:10:44.995 --> 00:10:47.650\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n&gt;&gt; Because it has to know what,\n\n245\n00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:48.760\nit's doing the calculations for you.\n\n246\n00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.020\nSo, you have to have some\ncalculations to start with.\n\n247\n00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.870\nSo just wanna make sure\ny'all know that point.\n\n248\n00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:57.200\nThis is always a fun one.\n\n249\n00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.494\nDefinitely consult your banks\nbefore actually going ahead and\n\n250\n00:10:59.494 --> 00:11:02.494\nsaying this is what you need, but it's one\nof those like how much car can I afford?\n\n251\n00:11:02.494 --> 00:11:10.170\nRight, okay and I did this when\npurchased sorry, Foxy that's her name.\n\n252\n00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.410\nI name all my cars and\nher name is Foxy Time Bandit.\n\n253\n00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:16.300\nSo that's after my favorite\nboat on my favorite show.\n\n254\n00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:17.528\n&gt;&gt; And my car's name is Jerk.\n\n255\n00:11:17.528 --> 00:11:21.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, Foxy, she likes to run.\n\n256\n00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.550\nShe's really just sporty and everything.\n\n257\n00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:27.246\nSo that's why her name\nis Foxy Time Bandit.\n\n258\n00:11:27.246 --> 00:11:29.560\n&gt;&gt; Very nice.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So we got here, and\n\n259\n00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.890\nthis is where, how much car can I afford?\n\n260\n00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:34.432\nI know that I'm gonna get\na five-year loan, and\n\n261\n00:11:34.432 --> 00:11:36.416\nI know that the interest rate is 5%.\n\n262\n00:11:36.416 --> 00:11:41.048\nAnd right now if I did $10,000,\nthat it would be around $188.\n\n263\n00:11:41.048 --> 00:11:45.993\nAgain, consult the bank first, but we're\ndoing this as a PMT calculation of where\n\n264\n00:11:45.993 --> 00:11:48.820\nyou take the interest rate,\ndivide it by 12,\n\n265\n00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:53.350\nwhich is the amount of months that\nyou are doing a monthly payment.\n\n266\n00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:56.874\nThen, you have what is the interest and\nwhat is the value of the loan.\n\n267\n00:11:56.874 --> 00:12:00.400\nSo, it's all in that function it\ngoes ahead and gives you $188.\n\n268\n00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:05.211\nIt puts it in parentheses in\nred because it's accounting and\n\n269\n00:12:05.211 --> 00:12:08.100\nit's showing you as a payment.\n\n270\n00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.270\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Like you're going to pay this amount,\n\n271\n00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:14.060\nso that's why it's showing you that way.\n\n272\n00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:17.870\nSo, I know I can afford,\nlet's say $250 a month.\n\n273\n00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:21.630\nOkay, I don't change these values but\nthen I wanna change the loan amount.\n\n274\n00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:23.000\nSo tell me how much car I could buy.\n\n275\n00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.200\nSo we're gonna do a what-if analysis here,\nwe're gonna goal seek.\n\n276\n00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.205\nI wanna set this cell,\nwhich is already selected.\n\n277\n00:12:30.205 --> 00:12:31.190\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n278\n00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:34.785\nI want to change it to a value of $250,\ncuz that's how much I can afford.\n\n279\n00:12:34.785 --> 00:12:35.520\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n280\n00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.100\n&gt;&gt; What cell am I going to change?\n\n281\n00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.810\nI'm not changing the loan or the interest,\nbecause that's what the bank told me.\n\n282\n00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:45.982\nI am gonna go ahead and\nsay tell me the loan amount that I want.\n\n283\n00:12:45.982 --> 00:12:50.090\nAnd also before I do this,\nI'm gonna go ahead and put a minus here,\n\n284\n00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:53.915\nbecause otherwise it's just gonna\nmake the loan amount a minus.\n\n285\n00:12:53.915 --> 00:12:54.450\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, okay.\n\n286\n00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:56.783\n&gt;&gt; Because, remember,\nit's like a payment thing and\n\n287\n00:12:56.783 --> 00:12:59.711\nthe whole negative number times\na negative number, all of that.\n\n288\n00:12:59.711 --> 00:13:00.941\nRemember all of those\nwonderful math rules?\n\n289\n00:13:00.941 --> 00:13:01.519\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n290\n00:13:01.519 --> 00:13:06.143\n&gt;&gt; So we go ahead and click OK and\nit calculates all right,\n\n291\n00:13:06.143 --> 00:13:10.365\nwell I can have $13,247.68 That's how\n\n292\n00:13:10.365 --> 00:13:15.280\nmuch car I can afford, or\nat least a ballpark figure.\n\n293\n00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.010\nAnd so that's where you could do\nanother one if you wanted like well,\n\n294\n00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:22.250\nwhat if I could probably lay\noff of catnip a little bit and\n\n295\n00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:25.310\nnot have all those cups of\ncatnip tea every morning.\n\n296\n00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:30.700\nAnd then I can go ahead and make that 275\nand that makes more car that I can afford,\n\n297\n00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.930\nand that can be kind of fun.\n\n298\n00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:36.020\nYou can do it all here within goal seeks.\n\n299\n00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:40.670\nSo, couple different scenarios or\nI guess I should say, well.\n\n300\n00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:41.200\nYeah, we'll say scenarios.\n\n301\n00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:41.797\n&gt;&gt; Stereos.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n302\n00:13:41.797 --> 00:13:43.520\nits one of those what-if tools-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n303\n00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:47.280\n&gt;&gt; So I don't wanna confuse,\nusing the same terminology in different\n\n304\n00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:47.882\nplaces.-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n305\n00:13:47.882 --> 00:13:49.160\nwe are using the what-if tool.\n\n306\n00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:49.945\nYeah?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n307\n00:13:49.945 --> 00:13:53.273\nSo this is what we could\ndo with goal seek.\n\n308\n00:13:53.273 --> 00:13:57.830\nI want to seek out at my goal at\ngetting the right amount of car or\n\n309\n00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:02.300\nget my cost per toy down,\nall of those different things and so\n\n310\n00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:05.912\nit's a pretty handy little guy and\nthere you go.\n\n311\n00:14:05.912 --> 00:14:07.120\nI like it.\n\n312\n00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:11.350\nNow I reminded myself that it's there and\nnow I'm gonna remember later\n\n313\n00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.730\nto where I don't have to keep\ndoing the punch in this number.\n\n314\n00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:16.320\nPunch in this number, punch in this\nnumber, that's what I need, so.\n\n315\n00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:19.870\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, great advice and\na great lesson to be learned.\n\n316\n00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:24.580\nGoal seek, and that's part of the Excel\n2016 Advanced series of videos.\n\n317\n00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.170\nVonne, marvelous job as usual.\n\n318\n00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:29.850\nMake sure you watch all the Excel\n2016 Advanced Series of videos.\n\n319\n00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:30.980\nYou'll be glad that you did.\n\n320\n00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.840\nAnd, thank you for watching OfficeProTV.\n\n321\n00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.510\nRemember, a good office\npro is always learning.\n\n322\n00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:36.210\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n323\n00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:37.120\n&gt;&gt;

Good.\n&gt;&gt; Teach us, teach us.\n\n12\n00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.045\n&gt;&gt; Removing duplicates means for me,\nwe're going to remove some duplicates.\n\n13\n00:00:38.045 --> 00:00:39.250\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Good, that's good.\n\n14\n00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.940\nI like it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n15\n00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:40.900\nIt's pretty straightforward.\n\n16\n00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.020\nThere's not much to really\nkind of get scary on that one.\n\n17\n00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.210\nBut we're going to go through some\ndifferent ways to remove duplicates.\n\n18\n00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.510\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n&gt;&gt; So, let's take a scenario.\n\n19\n00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.231\nWe were actually just filming\na scenario episode right before this.\n\n20\n00:00:53.231 --> 00:00:56.423\n&gt;&gt; It was awesome.\n&gt;&gt; So, we have a list of information and\n\n21\n00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:59.230\nwe can't have duplicate values.\n\n22\n00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.108\nLike, maybe somebody's address\ngot entered in there twice.\n\n23\n00:01:04.108 --> 00:01:06.044\nAnd especially in a mailing list,\n\n24\n00:01:06.044 --> 00:01:10.066\nyou don't want to have two pieces of\nthe same mail go to the same people.\n\n25\n00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:10.615\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n26\n00:01:10.615 --> 00:01:13.043\nthat would be something\nthat you might wanna do or\n\n27\n00:01:13.043 --> 00:01:15.615\nmaking sure that you all\nyou have unique order.\n\n28\n00:01:15.615 --> 00:01:17.095\nAll of your order numbers,\n\n29\n00:01:17.095 --> 00:01:19.225\nthey need to make sure that\nthere are duplicates in that.\n\n30\n00:01:19.225 --> 00:01:23.825\nAnd it's really more for just kind of\nvalidating the information that you have,\n\n31\n00:01:23.825 --> 00:01:25.695\nmaking sure that everything is correct.\n\n32\n00:01:25.695 --> 00:01:28.865\nSo, it kinda crosses a couple different\n\n33\n00:01:28.865 --> 00:01:32.215\nplaces in here of why you might\nwant to remove duplicates.\n\n34\n00:01:32.215 --> 00:01:33.216\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; Do it.\n\n35\n00:01:33.216 --> 00:01:35.790\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna go through\na couple of different examples.\n\n36\n00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:36.840\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n37\n00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.478\nI will go ahead preface that\nthe first one we're going to do,\n\n38\n00:01:39.478 --> 00:01:42.702\nif you're watching all these episodes,\nthen you've seen this before.\n\n39\n00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:47.537\nCuz we did this in the tables episode to\nwhere we remove duplicates with a really\n\n40\n00:01:47.537 --> 00:01:50.110\ncool command called remove duplicates.\n\n41\n00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.850\n&gt;&gt; No no, no no, it can't be.\n\n42\n00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.867\n&gt;&gt; No, it is really, I swear.\n\n43\n00:01:53.867 --> 00:01:55.083\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n44\n00:01:55.083 --> 00:01:57.175\n&gt;&gt; So we're going to be doing that with\n\n45\n00:01:57.175 --> 00:01:59.560\nthe actual remove duplicates command.\n\n46\n00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.780\nWe're also going to do\nconditional formatting and\n\n47\n00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.320\nadvanced filters with the unique records\ncheckbox, so just a couple different ways.\n\n48\n00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.498\nThere's some other ways I might go ahead\nand try to get another episode filmed\n\n49\n00:02:13.498 --> 00:02:18.916\nwith, but it involves some kind of complex\nformulas that to me, went a little bit\n\n50\n00:02:18.916 --> 00:02:24.196\nfurther than where I wanted to keep,\nlike the scope of this particular topic.\n\n51\n00:02:24.196 --> 00:02:27.030\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm\n&gt;&gt; So, I didn't wanna any of that project\n\n52\n00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.310\ncreep, you know about project management,\nthere is a scope and creep and all that\n\n53\n00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.970\nkind of fun stuff, so we're not gonna\ncreep all out of there, so we're gonna.\n\n54\n00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.977\n&gt;&gt; No creepers here.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, no creepers, yes.\n\n55\n00:02:36.977 --> 00:02:41.573\nSo, why don't we go ahead and take a look\nat the first example that we're going to\n\n56\n00:02:41.573 --> 00:02:43.941\ndo with our remove duplicates command and\n\n57\n00:02:43.941 --> 00:02:46.864\nI have a file aptly it's\nnamed remove duplicates.\n\n58\n00:02:46.864 --> 00:02:47.604\n&gt;&gt; Aptly, aptly.\n\n59\n00:02:47.604 --> 00:02:49.492\n&gt;&gt; Yes, okay.\n\n60\n00:02:49.492 --> 00:02:53.150\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not aptly, aptly.\n\n61\n00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.550\n&gt;&gt; Me and\nwords they kinda fight sometimes.\n\n62\n00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.052\n&gt;&gt; Nah, we're good.\n\n63\n00:02:56.052 --> 00:02:57.001\n&gt;&gt; And it's just like, what's going on.\n\n64\n00:02:57.001 --> 00:03:00.550\nAnd so yes, there we go, let's go.\n\n65\n00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.595\nRemove duplicates command I'm on this\nparticular worksheet right here and\n\n66\n00:03:05.595 --> 00:03:10.161\nthis is where I want to make sure that\nI do not have any duplicate values\n\n67\n00:03:10.161 --> 00:03:14.494\nwithin this and I'm pointing some\nout right now because you could\n\n68\n00:03:14.494 --> 00:03:19.272\nsee that Sasha Cat right here he has\nbeen entered in three times, okay?\n\n69\n00:03:19.272 --> 00:03:23.887\nThat's not something, we don't want that\nto happen, and I believe there's also I\n\n70\n00:03:23.887 --> 00:03:26.686\nthink Kimber, yeah Kimber here-\n&gt;&gt; Kimber the white lion.\n\n71\n00:03:26.686 --> 00:03:30.505\n&gt;&gt; Yep, Kimber the lion and\nthen I believe we also have Paul West.\n\n72\n00:03:30.505 --> 00:03:31.893\n[LAUGH] That's a silly name for a cat.\n\n73\n00:03:31.893 --> 00:03:36.330\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so we've got that right there.\n\n74\n00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.670\nSo we've got all these\ndifferent things going on.\n\n75\n00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.470\nI want to remove the duplicates.\n\n76\n00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.326\nSo with this particular command,\n\n77\n00:03:42.326 --> 00:03:46.365\nyou just have to select your cell\nsomewhere within the range that you have.\n\n78\n00:03:46.365 --> 00:03:52.055\nYou go up into your formulas now, you go\ninto your data, sorry, your data tab.\n\n79\n00:03:52.055 --> 00:03:53.103\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n80\n00:03:53.103 --> 00:03:57.367\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna over to this button\nright here that says remove duplicates,\n\n81\n00:03:57.367 --> 00:04:01.905\ndo not delete duplicate rows, now the\nthing with this particular command it is\n\n82\n00:04:01.905 --> 00:04:05.135\ngoing to do exactly [LAUGH] what it says,\nit will delete,\n\n83\n00:04:05.135 --> 00:04:09.230\nThey'll duplicate rows based on\nthe criteria that you choose.\n\n84\n00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.158\nSo this is one of those,\nit just does it and\n\n85\n00:04:12.158 --> 00:04:16.113\nyou don't see well like which\nones were the duplicate.\n\n86\n00:04:16.113 --> 00:04:19.853\nNow, I'm showing you here because\nwe have a way of just sorting it.\n\n87\n00:04:19.853 --> 00:04:24.926\nAnd so this is one of those ways that\nyou can kind of verify is with a sort,\n\n88\n00:04:24.926 --> 00:04:28.985\nokay if I see them let's just go ahead and\nget rid of them,\n\n89\n00:04:28.985 --> 00:04:33.974\nso right here I have determined the check\nboxes of all the columns that I\n\n90\n00:04:33.974 --> 00:04:37.520\nwant to match the duplicate values of.\n\n91\n00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.800\nAnd this would be a really good\nthing to have, headers on your data,\n\n92\n00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.150\nwe've talked about this so\nmany many episodes.\n\n93\n00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.430\nIn having headers within your columns\nis gonna make your life a lot,\n\n94\n00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.170\neasier in all sorts of ways.\n\n95\n00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:53.200\nSo I'm saying that everything has to\nmatch, everything, all of these columns.\n\n96\n00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.150\nIf they are duplicates,\nthat go across like for\n\n97\n00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.995\nexample Sasha Cat entered in three times,\nthen it will do this removal.\n\n98\n00:05:01.995 --> 00:05:04.995\nIf I click OK, it will say, yep,\n\n99\n00:05:04.995 --> 00:05:09.045\nI went ahead and found four duplicate\nvalues, and I removed them.\n\n100\n00:05:09.045 --> 00:05:12.314\nYou have 22 unique values remaining,\nperfect.\n\n101\n00:05:12.314 --> 00:05:16.848\nOn a small data set such as this, I can\nsee, yep, Sasha Cat has been removed, and\n\n102\n00:05:16.848 --> 00:05:17.807\nthat's great.\n\n103\n00:05:17.807 --> 00:05:21.911\nBut I had it set that every\nsingle column matched, so\n\n104\n00:05:21.911 --> 00:05:26.867\nthat's just a quick and\neasy way to do it, I love this command.\n\n105\n00:05:26.867 --> 00:05:29.460\nI use it a lot, I think it's fantastic.\n\n106\n00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.400\nSo I just like that it just gets\nrid of everything that I need.\n\n107\n00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.265\n&gt;&gt; And thank you,\nthat's all for this episode.\n\n108\n00:05:34.265 --> 00:05:36.353\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And scene.\n\n109\n00:05:36.353 --> 00:05:38.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, we're not done yet.\n\n110\n00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.080\nSo we have some other ones here and\nthis is the example again.\n\n111\n00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.040\nThis is a duplicate of the tables episode.\n\n112\n00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.875\nSo if you're like, I've heard this I know,\nwe're getting there.\n\n113\n00:05:48.875 --> 00:05:52.225\nSo we've got removed duplicates\nwith the unique students.\n\n114\n00:05:52.225 --> 00:05:55.805\nAnd this is something that I did\na lot back at the university.\n\n115\n00:05:55.805 --> 00:05:59.085\nSo what I have here, when we had different\n\n116\n00:06:00.295 --> 00:06:05.025\nmetrics that we would need to report,\nlike we had enrollments for the semester.\n\n117\n00:06:05.025 --> 00:06:10.110\nNow an enrollment means there's\nas many enrollments per class and\n\n118\n00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.820\nit could be that one student is\nenrolled three times but that counts.\n\n119\n00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.970\nBecause that’s if you think about\nthe enrollment that’s how much\n\n120\n00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.210\ntuition are dollars is coming in and\nthings like that.\n\n121\n00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.840\nSo, enrollments versus unique students,\ncuz just like I said.\n\n122\n00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.460\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, right.\n\n123\n00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.151\n&gt;&gt; You could have one student enrolled in\nthree classes and another student enrolled\n\n124\n00:06:28.151 --> 00:06:31.534\nin four classes well that’s seven\nenrollments but its only two students.\n\n125\n00:06:31.534 --> 00:06:32.484\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n126\n00:06:32.484 --> 00:06:35.472\n&gt;&gt; I don't think I used the right\namount of numbers right there.\n\n127\n00:06:35.472 --> 00:06:36.674\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But there are two unique.\n\n128\n00:06:36.674 --> 00:06:40.778\n&gt;&gt; Two more fingers\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So we've go this different like\n\n129\n00:06:40.778 --> 00:06:44.879\nmetric of unique students\nverses enrollment, so\n\n130\n00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:49.466\nsomething like this you can\nsee that I've got looks like\n\n131\n00:06:49.466 --> 00:06:54.174\n26 because the first row\nis ahead of 26 enrollments.\n\n132\n00:06:54.174 --> 00:06:58.538\nBut unique students would\nbe Jack Bowtie just once,\n\n133\n00:06:58.538 --> 00:07:02.470\nSasha Cat just once,\nand so on and so fort.\n\n134\n00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:07.530\nSo in this situation I would go to that\nRemove Duplicates and I don't want\n\n135\n00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:12.980\nthe course because one student couldn't\nbe enrolled in the same course.\n\n136\n00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.640\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So that way the course would\n\n137\n00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:20.000\nbe the unique value in a sense,\nbased on the person.\n\n138\n00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.360\nSo I want to say, I only want a first and\n\n139\n00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:27.520\nlast name to match there,\nand as long as the first and\n\n140\n00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:33.280\nlast name matches, go ahead and\ngive me just that one unique value.\n\n141\n00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.223\nRemove the duplicates and\nyou can click OK and\n\n142\n00:07:37.223 --> 00:07:43.552\nnow in this sense you could see that\nI have 11 duplicate values found and\n\n143\n00:07:43.552 --> 00:07:50.855\nremove, So I would have 15 unique\nstudents, but I would have 26 enrollments.\n\n144\n00:07:50.855 --> 00:07:56.823\nSo those are some different values there,\nso, great super simple but\n\n145\n00:07:56.823 --> 00:08:00.879\nwhat if this is one of\nthose It just takes it out.\n\n146\n00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:05.187\nWhat if there's two people named,\nlet's say, Mary Smith.\n\n147\n00:08:05.187 --> 00:08:08.890\nA very common first name,\na very common last name.\n\n148\n00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:09.815\n&gt;&gt; Or Jack Botox.\n\n149\n00:08:09.815 --> 00:08:13.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes exactly,\nthere's all sorts of different scenarios.\n\n150\n00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.670\nEspecially, I mean I lived\nwith this my whole life.\n\n151\n00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:18.863\nI'm a Smith, so\ndo you know how many Smiths there are?\n\n152\n00:08:18.863 --> 00:08:20.446\nCuz they're like what's your last name,\nI'm like Smith.\n\n153\n00:08:20.446 --> 00:08:24.115\nFirst name, but then they go to Vonne,\nand they're like well, wait, what?\n\n154\n00:08:24.115 --> 00:08:28.430\n[LAUGH] So\nit's a pretty unique marker right there.\n\n155\n00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:34.040\nBut that's something that in this command,\nyou wouldn't see that happen.\n\n156\n00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:38.400\nSo if there were four Mary Smiths,\nindividual unique students,\n\n157\n00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.400\nit would remove those out and\nyou wouldn't really see that.\n\n158\n00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:46.101\nSo you need to be somewhat careful\nabout using this particular command.\n\n159\n00:08:46.101 --> 00:08:51.724\nWhile it's great, you might wanna\ndo some other ways to evaluate it,\n\n160\n00:08:51.724 --> 00:08:56.012\nand you might need to do\nsome more manual evaluation,\n\n161\n00:08:56.012 --> 00:08:58.600\nif you wanna say, of your data.\n\n162\n00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.430\n&gt;&gt; Maybe use an initial for\nthe middle name too, as well.\n\n163\n00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:06.131\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and well, that's very true, but\nI mean there could be a Mary Amy Smith,\n\n164\n00:09:06.131 --> 00:09:08.318\nthat's three really common names.\n\n165\n00:09:08.318 --> 00:09:09.752\n&gt;&gt; And a Mary Angelo Smith.\n\n166\n00:09:09.752 --> 00:09:10.970\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n167\n00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:13.209\nSo I'm using some family\nnames right now actually.\n\n168\n00:09:13.209 --> 00:09:17.273\nSo those are ones that it's very possible.\n\n169\n00:09:17.273 --> 00:09:23.599\nSo even at that, like okay,\ngo ahead and get another, Criteria.\n\n170\n00:09:23.599 --> 00:09:27.575\nAnd this is where if you really had\nin a specific one like if you had,\n\n171\n00:09:27.575 --> 00:09:30.946\nstudent ID numbers, like you can't have-\n&gt;&gt; That's unique.\n\n172\n00:09:30.946 --> 00:09:35.318\n&gt;&gt; There's one that you have to think\nabout what thing field is the criteria\n\n173\n00:09:35.318 --> 00:09:37.623\nthat I cannot have duplicate values.\n\n174\n00:09:37.623 --> 00:09:38.280\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n175\n00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.800\n&gt;&gt; So\nthat would be a really good indicator.\n\n176\n00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.860\nNow, on the data, it of course\nleads itself to what is your data.\n\n177\n00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:46.350\nWhat kind of data do you have and\ncan you even make that happen?\n\n178\n00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.570\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So in our different examples.\n\n179\n00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:51.230\nPerfect, so\nlet's go over here to some other ones.\n\n180\n00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.850\nNow this is another thing,\nconditional formatting.\n\n181\n00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:55.810\nThis is something that we\ncovered in another episode, so\n\n182\n00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:59.230\nthis is somewhat of\na duplicate lesson as well.\n\n183\n00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:02.850\nBut just kinda throwing\nit into the idea of,\n\n184\n00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:05.650\nI need to get duplicate\nvalues removed from this.\n\n185\n00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:10.600\nSo in this sense, with conditional\nformatting, you do have to select\n\n186\n00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.150\nthe things that you want to apply\nthe conditional formatting to.\n\n187\n00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:17.580\nMeaning, formatting based on a condition.\n\n188\n00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.190\nNow in this one, you can see\nthat I have some order numbers.\n\n189\n00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:24.850\nSo maybe I have,\nI have have a unique order number.\n\n190\n00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:28.194\nAnd you can see and this can be, and\nthis happens all the time in data entry.\n\n191\n00:10:28.194 --> 00:10:31.601\nLike, we have two orders for 103.\n\n192\n00:10:31.601 --> 00:10:35.023\nSo you can see 102, 103, 103, 105.\n\n193\n00:10:35.023 --> 00:10:38.380\nWhoops, somebody actually\nentered that in wrong.\n\n194\n00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.500\nThis is also tied into slightly,\nif you're talking about the whole\n\n195\n00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:45.580\nconcept of trying to make sure that\nyour data entry is done correctly.\n\n196\n00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.960\nThere is something known as data\nvalidation, and that's another episode\n\n197\n00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.575\nthat I would definitely check out to\ntry to avoid this from happening.\n\n198\n00:10:52.575 --> 00:10:53.092\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n199\n00:10:53.092 --> 00:10:56.938\nthat could be used somewhat in\nthe same way as conditional formatting\n\n200\n00:10:56.938 --> 00:10:58.405\nthat I'm gonna show you.\n\n201\n00:10:58.405 --> 00:11:00.937\nSo definitely check that episode out, and\n\n202\n00:11:00.937 --> 00:11:05.580\nlearn about how people would get actually\na warning if you have multiple people\n\n203\n00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:10.527\nentering in data into one particular\nplace, especially with shared worksheets.\n\n204\n00:11:10.527 --> 00:11:14.133\nYou should definitely check out\nthe data validation episode in here,\n\n205\n00:11:14.133 --> 00:11:17.800\nbut in this sense, we're just gonna\nuse conditional formatting to see\n\n206\n00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:21.427\nwhere our duplicates are rather\nthan just straight-up remove them.\n\n207\n00:11:21.427 --> 00:11:22.120\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n208\n00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.599\n&gt;&gt; So you do need to select the column or\n\n209\n00:11:24.599 --> 00:11:29.670\nthe information that you want to\napply that conditional formatting to.\n\n210\n00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:33.460\nAnd so in this sense, we know that\nthe order number has to be unique.\n\n211\n00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:36.240\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So we come over here to our Home tab.\n\n212\n00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.302\nWe go over to our Conditional Formatting.\n\n213\n00:11:38.302 --> 00:11:44.175\nAnd then we go to our Highlight Cell Rules\nand we wanna go to Duplicate Values.\n\n214\n00:11:44.175 --> 00:11:48.195\nAnd when I choose Duplicate Values, now\nyou can see that it's going to fill with\n\n215\n00:11:48.195 --> 00:11:51.375\nthe default right now,\nwhich is light red with a dark text, but\n\n216\n00:11:51.375 --> 00:11:55.300\nyou can see that you have other\nones in there if you wanted to.\n\n217\n00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:58.464\nThe other thing that's kinda neat about\nthis is that while I can go ahead and\n\n218\n00:11:58.464 --> 00:12:01.902\ntell me where all the duplicates are,\nyou could also switch this over to unique.\n\n219\n00:12:01.902 --> 00:12:04.130\nI wanna see where my unique values are.\n\n220\n00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:07.464\nNow in this sense, in this example,\nthere's gonna be a lot more uniques\n\n221\n00:12:07.464 --> 00:12:11.030\nthan duplicates, but you can at least\nkinda go back and forth between there.\n\n222\n00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:14.727\nAnd if I click OK,\nnow I can kinda visually see, okay,\n\n223\n00:12:14.727 --> 00:12:16.760\nwell there's a problem.\n\n224\n00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:21.696\nAnd then I can really look at the entire\nrecord, if you wanna call it, even though\n\n225\n00:12:21.696 --> 00:12:27.015\nthis is not a database, that okay, I can\nsee this is really supposed to be 104.\n\n226\n00:12:27.015 --> 00:12:30.812\nAnd then you can see that then\nthe conditional formatting goes away.\n\n227\n00:12:30.812 --> 00:12:35.567\nBecause it doesn't abide by\nthe rule of what we're looking for,\n\n228\n00:12:35.567 --> 00:12:40.679\nis that if you're looking for\nformatting based on duplicate values.\n\n229\n00:12:40.679 --> 00:12:41.260\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n230\n00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:42.660\n&gt;&gt; So that's kind of something that,\nagain,\n\n231\n00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:46.080\nmore of a manual thing,\nbut at least it gives you\n\n232\n00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.926\nalmost like a report if you wanna say-\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n233\n00:12:47.926 --> 00:12:51.020\n&gt;&gt; Of where your duplicates are and\nyou can start looking at it.\n\n234\n00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:54.850\nSo that's one way that you can also\nlook through your information.\n\n235\n00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:56.389\n&gt;&gt; And\nit's pretty with the color in there.\n\n236\n00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:57.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, right?\n\n237\n00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.230\nAnd you can determine whatever type\nof color that you want for there.\n\n238\n00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:01.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know, that's great.\n\n239\n00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:05.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if you don't want red,if red's\nlike you can't mark in red pen anymore.\n\n240\n00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.870\nYou gotta mark in green for\nencouraging and stuff like that,\n\n241\n00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:11.300\nso you can format that with\ngreen if you wanted to.\n\n242\n00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:12.070\n&gt;&gt; Keep it green.\n\n243\n00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:12.780\n&gt;&gt; Keep it green.\n\n244\n00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:15.720\nSo that's one way you can start kind\n\n245\n00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.280\nof evaluating where your\nduplicate values are.\n\n246\n00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.900\nLet's go to our third example,\n\n247\n00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:24.990\nand this is our advanced filters\nwith unique record checks box.\n\n248\n00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:28.625\nAll righty, so let's move over\nto what I wanna talk about.\n\n249\n00:13:28.625 --> 00:13:32.369\nNow, we've talked about sorting and\nfiltering in this series as well.\n\n250\n00:13:32.369 --> 00:13:33.485\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n251\n00:13:33.485 --> 00:13:36.835\n&gt;&gt; And we went into our auto filters.\n\n252\n00:13:36.835 --> 00:13:37.980\nWe've also talked about tables.\n\n253\n00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.490\nYou know how much I love tables.\n\n254\n00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:40.747\nI think they're fantastic.\n\n255\n00:13:40.747 --> 00:13:41.764\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; I put everything,\n\n256\n00:13:41.764 --> 00:13:43.220\nit's formatted as a table.\n\n257\n00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.982\nRight up here, format as table,\nI love that stuff.\n\n258\n00:13:45.982 --> 00:13:50.382\nOkay, but in this one,\nI wanted to show you the check box for\n\n259\n00:13:50.382 --> 00:13:55.488\nthe unique values in an advanced\nfilter that can be kinda cool.\n\n260\n00:13:55.488 --> 00:13:59.280\nAnd this will tie into how\nyou can use this to look for\n\n261\n00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:04.410\nyour duplicates and\nkind of manually remove them again.\n\n262\n00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:08.550\nThis first one I just wanna show you\na quick example of what I'm talking about.\n\n263\n00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:13.580\nYou can see we still have our Sasha cat,\nand our mocha cup but these\n\n264\n00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:18.190\nare ones that it's kind of going back to\nthat unique student record or whatever.\n\n265\n00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:20.190\nTo where I have Sasha cat but\n\n266\n00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:24.800\nI just want to remove the duplicates\nbased off of the first and last name.\n\n267\n00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.910\nCuz we have Sales, Marketing,\nand Human Resources.\n\n268\n00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:29.680\nThis is again back to\nthat whole class thing.\n\n269\n00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.960\nSo when you're doing an advanced filter,\nyou still need to go ahead and select\n\n270\n00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:39.140\nthe fields or columns that you want\nto do that advanced filtering by.\n\n271\n00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:43.992\nSo I'm gonna select columns A and\nB, because I wanna match first and\n\n272\n00:14:43.992 --> 00:14:48.346\nlast name as finding the duplicates,\nnot using the course.\n\n273\n00:14:48.346 --> 00:14:52.207\nSo I wanna to come over to our Data tab.\n\n274\n00:14:52.207 --> 00:14:54.323\nOn the Data tab,\nover in the Sort and Filter,\n\n275\n00:14:54.323 --> 00:14:56.343\nyou have that Advanced button right here.\n\n276\n00:14:56.343 --> 00:15:01.470\nAnd when you click on the Advanced,\nnotice that we have here some Actions.\n\n277\n00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:03.370\nDo I want to filter the list in place?\n\n278\n00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:05.300\nThat is something that I would like to do.\n\n279\n00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:08.976\nAnd you can also see like you could,\nwhatever type of filtering that you're\n\n280\n00:15:08.976 --> 00:15:13.310\ngoing to do, you could actually copy\nthat out and put into another location.\n\n281\n00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:18.250\nSo if you're trying to pull out something,\nlike I only want to see\n\n282\n00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:22.180\nthe people named Jack or whatever.\n\n283\n00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.790\nNow it does kinda come out into\nthis whole criteria range.\n\n284\n00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:28.740\nSo it gets into a little\nbit different stuff, and\n\n285\n00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:30.840\nI don't think I actually have\ndone an episode on this.\n\n286\n00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.700\nSo I think I'm gonna make\na note to go ahead and\n\n287\n00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:35.791\ndo that, of advanced filtering and\nhow to copy out into another location.\n\n288\n00:15:35.791 --> 00:15:37.283\nIt has got some pretty cool stuff.\n\n289\n00:15:37.283 --> 00:15:39.210\n&gt;&gt; I see the light bulb\nappearing above your head.\n\n290\n00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:42.078\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, it's one of those like,\nI could do an episode about this.\n\n291\n00:15:42.078 --> 00:15:44.262\nSo you know what, I'm gonna do that.\n\n292\n00:15:44.262 --> 00:15:48.030\nRemind me later so [LAUGH] I don't forget.\n\n293\n00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:51.567\nBut in this, we're taking an example\nof filtering a list in place.\n\n294\n00:15:51.567 --> 00:15:54.370\nRight there, unique records only.\n\n295\n00:15:54.370 --> 00:16:00.080\nSo if I check that box off and\nI'm using this whole A and B column.\n\n296\n00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:06.962\nWe're going to click OK, to show you what\nis being done here is that it removed,\n\n297\n00:16:06.962 --> 00:16:11.390\nit didn't really remove, it just hid them.\n\n298\n00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:15.410\nJust like we did when our\nfiltering went with our drop down,\n\n299\n00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:17.790\nit's not deleting anything,\nit's just hiding them.\n\n300\n00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:20.670\nAnd I know that I'm hiding information,\n\n301\n00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:25.080\nbecause you can see the row references\nover here, they're in blue.\n\n302\n00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:29.910\nAny time you see a blue row or\ncolumns, I should say,\n\n303\n00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:34.900\nthat means that something is being hidden\nright there or filtered out really.\n\n304\n00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:36.030\nI should really clarify that.\n\n305\n00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:40.140\nIt's not hidden because you don't really\nget any indication visual on a hidden row.\n\n306\n00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:41.780\nIt's really more of a filter.\n\n307\n00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.850\nSo let me just clarify that.\n\n308\n00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:46.340\nThat means there's filters going on here.\n\n309\n00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.170\nAnd you can kinda see that,\nokay, 8, 9, 10.\n\n310\n00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:52.020\nSo 9 is being filtered out and\nsome other ones down here.\n\n311\n00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.158\nSo that's what it's going to do.\n\n312\n00:16:54.158 --> 00:17:00.210\nNow take this one more step and\nwhat you could do is start using some\n\n313\n00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:04.060\nmanual formatting and manual evaluation\nof when you want to remove duplicates.\n\n314\n00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.540\nLet me show you.\n\n315\n00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:06.520\nCome in over here the next one.\n\n316\n00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:10.030\nWe're gonna do the same thing let's\ngo ahead and do the first and last,\n\n317\n00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:12.720\nand we'll do our advanced and\nwe will filter in place,\n\n318\n00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.313\nwe'll give our unique records and\nwe'll click OK.\n\n319\n00:17:15.313 --> 00:17:18.720\nAnd now I can see that I have\nsome filtered out information.\n\n320\n00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.341\nSo, they're filtered,\n\n321\n00:17:20.341 --> 00:17:24.401\nbut they also are kind of hidden\nfrom us they're not being shown.\n\n322\n00:17:24.401 --> 00:17:28.986\nSo what you can do here is now once you've\nfiltered out based on your criteria, for\n\n323\n00:17:28.986 --> 00:17:33.637\nexample, ours was first and last name for\nfinding the duplicate we're really just\n\n324\n00:17:33.637 --> 00:17:38.223\nonly giving the unique that's the same as\nfind duplicate, as show me the unique,\n\n325\n00:17:38.223 --> 00:17:40.140\nthat kind of stuff.\n\n326\n00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:44.910\nNow we're going to do Ctrl+A within\nthis range, Ctrl+A is select all, so\n\n327\n00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:47.090\nI'm just selecting all of these and\n\n328\n00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:51.212\nI'm going to come over here, and I'm\ngoing to fill this in with a cell color.\n\n329\n00:17:51.212 --> 00:17:54.850\nLet's just go with a light blue,\nor whatever, yeah we'll go blue.\n\n330\n00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.828\nSo now all of these rows, or\nall of these cells, really,\n\n331\n00:18:00.828 --> 00:18:03.720\nhave been changed with the cell color.\n\n332\n00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:08.465\nCome back over to your Data tab and\nthen you clear the filters out.\n\n333\n00:18:08.465 --> 00:18:12.766\nIf you clear the filters now all\nthose rows that I filtered out,\n\n334\n00:18:12.766 --> 00:18:15.920\nthey didn't get the blue cell filling.\n\n335\n00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:19.330\nSo this is another visual\nrepresentation of,\n\n336\n00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:23.870\nnow you're showing me where all\nthose duplicates were found.\n\n337\n00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:27.160\nBecause I know that those are the\nduplicates, because they're not in blue.\n\n338\n00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:27.780\nSweet.\n\n339\n00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:28.350\nSo now\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n340\n00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:29.000\n&gt;&gt; Isn't that neat?\n\n341\n00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:29.500\nSo now\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n342\n00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.821\n&gt;&gt; You see I get the flow going on here?\n\n343\n00:18:31.821 --> 00:18:32.406\n&gt;&gt; The gist of your\n\n344\n00:18:32.406 --> 00:18:32.955\ngib.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n345\n00:18:32.955 --> 00:18:33.484\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n346\n00:18:33.484 --> 00:18:35.137\n&gt;&gt; Yay, so now I've got here,\n\n347\n00:18:35.137 --> 00:18:39.192\nwell there's the Sasha cat.\nSo what's going on with their,\n\n348\n00:18:39.192 --> 00:18:43.962\nlook we have Sasha cat at 12312333,\none's a street,\n\n349\n00:18:43.962 --> 00:18:49.360\none's a boulevard, so\nwe have Moscow boulevard or Moscow Street.\n\n350\n00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:53.833\nYou know which is one and everything on\nthat and by the way Sasha was my baby,\n\n351\n00:18:53.833 --> 00:18:58.672\nhe was a Russian Blue Cat and that's why\nwe have his address as Moscow Boulevard.\n\n352\n00:18:58.672 --> 00:19:00.663\n&gt;&gt; Russian Blue, he's nice.\n\n353\n00:19:00.663 --> 00:19:03.495\n&gt;&gt; And he was actually named\nafter my best friend at the time.\n\n354\n00:19:03.495 --> 00:19:05.195\nHe's still a good friend of mine.\n\n355\n00:19:05.195 --> 00:19:06.775\nHis name is Sasha and he's Russian.\n\n356\n00:19:06.775 --> 00:19:09.288\nSo it kind of all goes together like that.\n\n357\n00:19:09.288 --> 00:19:09.895\n&gt;&gt; That's cool.\n\n358\n00:19:09.895 --> 00:19:11.785\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's why I have that there.\n\n359\n00:19:11.785 --> 00:19:15.525\nBut anyways, I can see that if I'm\nthe one kind of analyzing this data,\n\n360\n00:19:15.525 --> 00:19:16.775\nyou know what?\n\n361\n00:19:16.775 --> 00:19:18.835\nThis is the right one.\n\n362\n00:19:18.835 --> 00:19:20.135\nThese two are wrong.\n\n363\n00:19:20.135 --> 00:19:25.190\nSo what you're going to need to do is\ncome over here add another column,\n\n364\n00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:26.610\nlike say, remove.\n\n365\n00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:29.660\nSo we'll say, remove.\n\n366\n00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:30.854\nOkay, there we go.\n\n367\n00:19:30.854 --> 00:19:33.610\n[LAUGH] Pretend I can type.\n\n368\n00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:34.257\n&gt;&gt; There's an R in it.\n\n369\n00:19:34.257 --> 00:19:41.111\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So this is the correct one, so\nI would put like a Y here and a Y here.\n\n370\n00:19:41.111 --> 00:19:43.992\nDon't worry about the coloration,\ncuz we'll change that later.\n\n371\n00:19:43.992 --> 00:19:47.029\nSo these are the wrong ones,\nthis is the right one, so\n\n372\n00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:49.740\nI'm putting a Y in this\nextra column to remove.\n\n373\n00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:56.320\nSo let's come down here and\nlook at advertizing with a z.\n\n374\n00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.330\nThat's not right, that needs to go away.\n\n375\n00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:01.940\nThe other one is the correct one,\nso let's remove that one.\n\n376\n00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:07.420\nKeep on going down, okay, Pumpkin Squash\nwhat's going on with this one so\n\n377\n00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:09.030\nwhy is this being held?\n\n378\n00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:13.070\nNow, this is where I know why it is but\nI kind of forgot one step\n\n379\n00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:17.870\nthere we should probably go ahead and\nsort, before we did this.\n\n380\n00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:21.300\nOnly because I know in this example,\n\n381\n00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:26.220\nwhat I'm trying to get to is there's\ntwo employees named Pumpkin Squash.\n\n382\n00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.421\nSee that whole kind of manually\nlooking through all this?\n\n383\n00:20:28.421 --> 00:20:30.197\n&gt;&gt; Go figure how that could happen.\n\n384\n00:20:30.197 --> 00:20:31.409\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know right?\n\n385\n00:20:31.409 --> 00:20:36.160\nSo why don't we go ahead and sort this too\nto help us with this whole determination.\n\n386\n00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:41.950\nWe'll click on that column that we\nwant to sort by, we'll sort A to Z.\n\n387\n00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:45.200\nAnd then we'll come down to,\nthere we go, Pumpkin Squash.\n\n388\n00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.990\nYes, there is a Pumpkin Squash in\nmarketing that lives in Stewart, Florida.\n\n389\n00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:52.220\nThere's also a Pumpkin Squash that\nlives in Hickory, North Carolina.\n\n390\n00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:56.310\nSo those are both correct,\neven though it's found the duplicate,\n\n391\n00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:58.920\nthat whole Mary Smith thing\nthat we're talking about.\n\n392\n00:20:58.920 --> 00:20:59.660\nThese are fine.\n\n393\n00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:03.125\nSo these are not gonna get a Y\nbecause they shouldn't be removed.\n\n394\n00:21:03.125 --> 00:21:04.280\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n395\n00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:07.548\n&gt;&gt; Yes they're duplicates\nbased on first and last but\n\n396\n00:21:07.548 --> 00:21:10.593\nthey're are two different\nPumpkin Squashes.\n\n397\n00:21:10.593 --> 00:21:14.350\nSo we go down here and then we've got, and\nthere's a couple, now that I sorted it.\n\n398\n00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:16.870\nIt kind of went out of,\nokay we got the Kim, but Paul West.\n\n399\n00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:20.270\nOkay.\nThere is the last one oof that Paul West.\n\n400\n00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:22.540\nOkay, what's the difference here?\n\n401\n00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:23.640\nTeam, okay?\n\n402\n00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:25.430\nIs he on team red or team blue?\n\n403\n00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:29.620\nWell he's actually on team blue,\nthe red was incorrect.\n\n404\n00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:33.790\nSo, as you can see,\nsome of the ones that were marked as\n\n405\n00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:39.190\nduplicates that in the other example,\nthey would've just removed them.\n\n406\n00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:42.650\nThe ones that their marking were\nactually ones that I want to keep,\n\n407\n00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:46.130\nand actually I think I just did that.\n\n408\n00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:47.500\nThen the red is the wrong one.\n\n409\n00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.300\nThere we go.\nHe really is on team blue.\n\n410\n00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:55.430\nAgain, trying to show you that you need to\nkind of have a quicker way of being able\n\n411\n00:21:55.430 --> 00:22:00.846\nto analyze your data to be able to\ndetermine which team is Paul West on.\n\n412\n00:22:00.846 --> 00:22:04.187\nHow many Pumpkins you have in your\norganization, which one is wrong and\n\n413\n00:22:04.187 --> 00:22:05.470\nwhich one is right.\n\n414\n00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:08.950\nSo this is where I can use\nthese different techniques.\n\n415\n00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:14.934\nAnd now I can then take the Remove\ncolumn Sort A to Z in here,\n\n416\n00:22:14.934 --> 00:22:21.301\nthese are the ones that, yes,\nare duplicate rows in my list.\n\n417\n00:22:21.301 --> 00:22:24.940\nGo ahead and come over, delete those rows.\n\n418\n00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:29.990\nAnd now I have a true\nrepresentation of getting rid\n\n419\n00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:35.040\nof you duplicate values because yeah,\ncomputers are great.\n\n420\n00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.500\nAnd machines can do a lot of stuff for us.\n\n421\n00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:41.800\nBut there's something to say about\ngoing through and really looking at\n\n422\n00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:46.600\nthe information that you know, and\nbeing able to make that determination.\n\n423\n00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.430\nAnd then you just come over to\nthis Remove column, delete that.\n\n424\n00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:56.610\nCome in here, select all these, go ahead\nand just clear all of the cell fills.\n\n425\n00:22:56.610 --> 00:23:04.660\nAnd now I'm back to a list of data\nthat is real removed duplicates.\n\n426\n00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:07.870\nJust kind of combines\ndifferent techniques.\n\n427\n00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:11.380\nSo, again, a lot of stuff in this episode\nis not really brand new in a sense,\n\n428\n00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:13.810\nit's coming from other lessons\nthat we've had through out that.\n\n429\n00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:18.735\nThe advance filters is probably the only\nlike, new thing I've not covered so far.\n\n430\n00:23:18.735 --> 00:23:19.362\n&gt;&gt; But you will.\n\n431\n00:23:19.362 --> 00:23:20.879\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n432\n00:23:20.879 --> 00:23:22.604\nYes, cuz I told you remind, see.\n\n433\n00:23:22.604 --> 00:23:24.610\n&gt;&gt; I'd already forgotten,\nthank you so much sir.\n\n434\n00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:26.275\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because I need that.\n\n435\n00:23:26.275 --> 00:23:27.465\nI need to keep on track.\n\n436\n00:23:27.465 --> 00:23:29.835\nAnd I'm just here to try\nto keep you on track.\n\n437\n00:23:29.835 --> 00:23:32.065\nAnd hopefully learn some\nof these different tools.\n\n438\n00:23:32.065 --> 00:23:34.665\nAnd I use some of these techniques.\n\n439\n00:23:34.665 --> 00:23:35.685\nI use all of them actually.\n\n440\n00:23:35.685 --> 00:23:39.762\nAnd so that's why I wanted to make\na specific episode on removing duplicates,\n\n441\n00:23:39.762 --> 00:23:42.098\nand I hope you all had\nlots of fun with it.\n\n442\n00:23:42.098 --> 00:23:43.380\n&gt;&gt; And you do keep us on track.\n\n443\n00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:44.660\nYou do a wonderful job, Vonne.\n\n444\n00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:46.420\nRemove duplicates, great episode.\n\n445\n00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:51.840\nAnd in fact, all the episodes in the Excel\n2016 Advanced series are fantastic\n\n446\n00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.040\ncuz Vonne taught them.\n\n447\n00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:55.610\nSo make sure you watch every one of them,\nyou'll be glad you did.\n\n448\n00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:58.140\nAnd thank you for watching OfficeProTV.\n\n449\n00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:00.820\nRemember, a good Office Pro\nis always learning.\n\n450\n00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:01.575\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n451\n00:24:01.575 --> 00:24:02.390\n&gt;&gt;

to another great\nepisode of OfficeProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.500\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nAnd in today's episode, well,\n\n5\n00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.930\nwe're continuing on with our\nExcel 2016 Advanced series.\n\n6\n00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.217\nIt's been a lot of fun so far.\n\n7\n00:00:18.217 --> 00:00:21.739\nAnd joining us back in the studios\nto continue with the

going\nto be doing a party.\n\n19\n00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.435\nWe're going to be talking\nabout Fuego's birthday today.\n\n20\n00:00:37.435 --> 00:00:38.670\n&gt;&gt; Happy birthday, Fuego.\n\n21\n00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.750\n&gt;&gt; Right, and if we're gonna\nhave Fuego's birthday party,\n\n22\n00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.780\nwe're gonna have to have some pictures,\nright?\n\n23\n00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.104\nWe're gonna have to have some\npictures that say happy birthday, and\n\n24\n00:00:48.104 --> 00:00:51.324\nsome balloons, and then put cute\nlittle pictures of him in there.\n\n25\n00:00:51.324 --> 00:00:53.228\nThat's what you do with an invitation.\n\n26\n00:00:53.228 --> 00:00:53.789\n&gt;&gt; Last time I checked.\n\n27\n00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.640\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Now,\n\n28\n00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.180\nlet me put a disclaimer\nout there right now.\n\n29\n00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.010\nIt's like, now,\nwould I make a party invitation in Excel?\n\n30\n00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.835\nWell, I'm gonna do it for you.\n\n31\n00:01:04.835 --> 00:01:08.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But there are other programs.\n\n32\n00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.318\nLike Word has a bunch of premade templates\nthat you can do invitations that have all\n\n33\n00:01:12.318 --> 00:01:14.497\nthat kind of graphics and\neverything in there.\n\n34\n00:01:14.497 --> 00:01:16.035\n&gt;&gt; It does beg the question, Vonne.\n\n35\n00:01:16.035 --> 00:01:17.032\nWe're talking Excel here.\n\n36\n00:01:17.032 --> 00:01:18.079\nWe're talking about data.\n\n37\n00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:21.669\nProbably doing some sort of\ncalculations and formulations and\n\n38\n00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:23.320\nthings of that nature.\n\n39\n00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.290\nWhat is the purpose of putting\nimages into our Excel spreadsheets?\n\n40\n00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.136\n&gt;&gt; That's a fantastic point.\n\n41\n00:01:28.136 --> 00:01:30.931\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just to add a little bit of flair,\n\n42\n00:01:30.931 --> 00:01:32.248\nlittle pieces of flair in there.\n\n43\n00:01:32.248 --> 00:01:32.903\n&gt;&gt; Could be.\n\n44\n00:01:32.903 --> 00:01:38.130\nWe do use this for presentation purposes\nand images do help in presentation.\n\n45\n00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.584\nMaybe they can help illustrate a point or\na reason.\n\n46\n00:01:42.584 --> 00:01:43.968\nWe have a table or something like that.\n\n47\n00:01:43.968 --> 00:01:45.930\nIt can make things a whole\nlot easier to follow.\n\n48\n00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.840\nSo I would assume that's\nwhy they've done this.\n\n49\n00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.605\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, I mean,\nuse it at your discretion.\n\n50\n00:01:51.605 --> 00:01:54.166\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] At when you might need it.\n\n51\n00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:54.782\n&gt;&gt; Don't drink and image.\n\n52\n00:01:54.782 --> 00:01:56.222\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's never good.\n\n53\n00:01:56.222 --> 00:01:59.435\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Maybe throwing a company logo in.\n\n54\n00:01:59.435 --> 00:02:02.627\nSo you could always say,\nI've gotta put a logo on my spreadsheet.\n\n55\n00:02:02.627 --> 00:02:04.589\nOr, I wanna put a little arrow,\nlike shapes.\n\n56\n00:02:04.589 --> 00:02:08.725\nBecause we are gonna be talking about\ndifferent graphical elements within Excel.\n\n57\n00:02:08.725 --> 00:02:12.326\nAnd that's the whole topic of\nthese particular episodes,\n\n58\n00:02:12.326 --> 00:02:13.845\nis graphical elements.\n\n59\n00:02:13.845 --> 00:02:16.555\n[LAUGH] So\nit includes things like images and shapes.\n\n60\n00:02:16.555 --> 00:02:17.702\nAnd we're gonna talk about smart art.\n\n61\n00:02:17.702 --> 00:02:21.710\nBut in this one we are gonna talk\nabout images to start off with.\n\n62\n00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.350\nAnd what we're gonna do here is we're\ngonna show you how to insert different\n\n63\n00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.076\ntypes of images, either from your files,\nlike say I have a picture of Fuego.\n\n64\n00:02:31.076 --> 00:02:33.879\nNow, how you get your\npictures onto your computer,\n\n65\n00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.736\nthat's a whole other ball of wax.\n\n66\n00:02:35.736 --> 00:02:38.835\n[LAUGH] It's like, how do I get my\npictures from my phone to my computer?\n\n67\n00:02:38.835 --> 00:02:42.540\nIt's like, well, there's so\nmany variations we're not gonna go there.\n\n68\n00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.390\nWe're just going to assume\nthat you have some files and\n\n69\n00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.090\nyou're going to be able to insert them.\n\n70\n00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.470\nOr, since this is an Office product, it's\ngoing to be able to let us go online to\n\n71\n00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.699\nbe able to do some image searches and\nbe able to use some of those.\n\n72\n00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:02.059\nNow, that being said, like I said,\nyou're going to use these as needed.\n\n73\n00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:06.332\nAnd we're not gonna go too deep into a lot\nof the different things with images,\n\n74\n00:03:06.332 --> 00:03:08.886\nin the sense of file formats and\nresolutions.\n\n75\n00:03:08.886 --> 00:03:10.102\nI'll touch on them here and there.\n\n76\n00:03:10.102 --> 00:03:15.279\nBut there is an episode in the Word\nseries, I believe it's Word Advanced,\n\n77\n00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:19.733\nthat I go a little bit deeper into\nwhat it means to be a JPG and GIF.\n\n78\n00:03:19.733 --> 00:03:21.881\nAnd so\nif you might want to check that out.\n\n79\n00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:25.119\nIt's one of those I can't help but\nmention it, but\n\n80\n00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:27.392\nI'm not gonna go too crazy into it.\n\n81\n00:03:27.392 --> 00:03:32.166\nAnd, that also being said,\nif you've used this in Word or PowerPoint,\n\n82\n00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:35.141\nall of the stuff that you\ncan do with images and\n\n83\n00:03:35.141 --> 00:03:38.640\nshapes are the same across\nall of your products.\n\n84\n00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.550\nSo if you know it in one,\nyou know it in the other.\n\n85\n00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.876\nAnd so that's why I like to go ahead and\n\n86\n00:03:42.876 --> 00:03:46.309\ninclude being able to format\nyour images within Excel.\n\n87\n00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:50.230\nBecause maybe you learned it in Excel and\nwere like, this is super cool.\n\n88\n00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.785\nNow I wanna be able to go ahead and\ndo it in Word.\n\n89\n00:03:51.785 --> 00:03:53.657\nCuz maybe you don't use Word as much or\nwhatever.\n\n90\n00:03:53.657 --> 00:03:58.215\nBut now you know that particular\narea of this Office product and\n\n91\n00:03:58.215 --> 00:04:01.060\nall the other Office products as well.\n\n92\n00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.430\nSo were gonna jump down into\nour file called Graphic.xlxs.\n\n93\n00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:08.800\nI have two worksheets.\n\n94\n00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.860\nAnd this one were starting\nwith is just Insert Images.\n\n95\n00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.100\nThis is where we're just\ngonna get them in there.\n\n96\n00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.400\nAnd then we're gonna do some basic stuff.\n\n97\n00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.713\nAnd then in the next episode we're gonna\ntalk about formatting them with styles and\n\n98\n00:04:18.713 --> 00:04:19.670\neverything like that.\n\n99\n00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.534\nSo it doesn't really matter\nwhat cell we're in here,\n\n100\n00:04:22.534 --> 00:04:25.580\nbecause we're not putting\na picture in a cell.\n\n101\n00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.340\nIt just kind of floats on top of\nall the information around it.\n\n102\n00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.790\nSo it doesn't have to be a specific place.\n\n103\n00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.190\n&gt;&gt; So does that mean if we\nhave data in the cells,\n\n104\n00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.156\nit would cover the data in the cells?\n\n105\n00:04:36.156 --> 00:04:36.860\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n106\n00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.694\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of like floating on top.\n\n107\n00:04:39.694 --> 00:04:44.496\nAnd then we're gonna have to be able to\nkinda move around the image to where it\n\n108\n00:04:44.496 --> 00:04:46.310\ndoesn't overlap our data.\n\n109\n00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.130\nSo think of it kind of as a floating\nlayer on top of everything else.\n\n110\n00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.775\nSo let's go to Insert, because that's the\ntab we need to go into to, [LAUGH] yep.\n\n111\n00:04:55.775 --> 00:04:56.407\n&gt;&gt; Insert.\n\n112\n00:04:56.407 --> 00:04:57.021\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n113\n00:04:57.021 --> 00:05:02.470\nthis is in the Illustrations group\nbecause of my resolution on my monitor.\n\n114\n00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:03.750\nYou might have it across.\n\n115\n00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.180\nYou might see the Pictures and\n\n116\n00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.040\nOnline Pictures buttons\nright there on the ribbon.\n\n117\n00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.700\nSo we're gonna go with Pictures and\nclick on that.\n\n118\n00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.861\nSo this is where we're going out\ninto our computer to find files that\n\n119\n00:05:15.861 --> 00:05:16.813\nwe want to get.\n\n120\n00:05:16.813 --> 00:05:18.690\nNow, I do have a picture\nof Fuego right there, but\n\n121\n00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.180\nI'm gonna go over here to the Desktop.\n\n122\n00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.949\nCuz I have a folder called\npictures that I can choose from.\n\n123\n00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:26.053\nSo here we go, I have some pictures.\n\n124\n00:05:26.053 --> 00:05:29.206\nNow, there is something about resolution.\n\n125\n00:05:29.206 --> 00:05:32.640\nAnd resolution, technically,\nit's pixels per inch, but\n\n126\n00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.934\nit's really in this sense what we're gonna\ntalk about is the overall file size.\n\n127\n00:05:35.934 --> 00:05:41.656\nIf I hover over this file, you can see\nthat it's got a 3,000 by 4,000 pixels.\n\n128\n00:05:41.656 --> 00:05:43.034\nThat's a big image.\n\n129\n00:05:43.034 --> 00:05:48.230\nSo there's a lot of information there, as\nopposed to, say, this picture right here.\n\n130\n00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.884\nBishop is 480 by 640.\n\n131\n00:05:50.884 --> 00:05:52.700\nAnd then this one, look at that one.\n\n132\n00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.109\nThis one is, if I hover,\nI was trying to, there, 60 by 80.\n\n133\n00:05:57.109 --> 00:05:58.982\nAnd, Dan, have you ever done this?\n\n134\n00:05:58.982 --> 00:06:02.429\nWhere you put a picture into something and\nthen you try to make it bigger and\n\n135\n00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:03.904\nit just doesn't look good?\n\n136\n00:06:03.904 --> 00:06:07.669\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you start zooming in,\ntrying to resize and make it bigger so\n\n137\n00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:09.427\nit fits in just the right spot.\n\n138\n00:06:09.427 --> 00:06:13.751\nBut it looks like pixelated garbage,\nlike someone threw up on your screen.\n\n139\n00:06:13.751 --> 00:06:18.538\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, and that's because\nyou didn't have enough pixels to work\n\n140\n00:06:18.538 --> 00:06:23.430\nwith to begin with to where you can be\nable to make that bigger or smaller.\n\n141\n00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.503\nSmaller is always okay, but\ntrying to go bigger, so that's one-\n\n142\n00:06:25.503 --> 00:06:27.370\n&gt;&gt; They deal with that in photography.\n\n143\n00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.610\nCuz if you don't have enough\nmegapixels in your photo and\n\n144\n00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.310\nyou try to do a large print,\nit's not gonna look very good at all.\n\n145\n00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\ncorrelating into printing, exactly.\n\n146\n00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.060\nSo just knowing and\nlooking at the numbers.\n\n147\n00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.600\nSo if somebody sent you this picture\nthat's 60 by 80 pixels, there's only so\n\n148\n00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.920\nmuch you can do with it.\n\n149\n00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.110\nIt will be that size.\n\n150\n00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.420\nYou can make it bigger and\nit just will look bad.\n\n151\n00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that's kind of a big pet peeve.\n\n152\n00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.890\nI'll see flyers or posters and\nI'll see people's logos and\n\n153\n00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:59.480\nI'm like, you should've sent them a higher\nresolution graphic, but that's okay.\n\n154\n00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.270\nI digress.\n\n155\n00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.480\nLet's put in a picture of Mr. Fuego.\n\n156\n00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.975\nWe'll click on that and\nwe'll say Insert, and then there you go.\n\n157\n00:07:06.975 --> 00:07:10.081\nNow, notice I am zoomed out of this\nworksheet for a decent amount so\n\n158\n00:07:10.081 --> 00:07:12.424\nwe can kind of get these\nbigger pictures in there.\n\n159\n00:07:12.424 --> 00:07:14.160\nAnd notice it's just moving around.\n\n160\n00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.583\nIt's not in a cell.\n\n161\n00:07:15.583 --> 00:07:18.820\nNow, how do I know that\nI'm moving this image?\n\n162\n00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:23.008\nWell, I've got a four-pointed arrow, there\nwe go, right about there you can see it,\n\n163\n00:07:23.008 --> 00:07:24.206\nto where it is selected.\n\n164\n00:07:24.206 --> 00:07:27.280\nAnd I know I'm over it because of that.\n\n165\n00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.830\nI know it is selected because I can see\nthe little dots around the outside.\n\n166\n00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:34.290\nAnd if I zoom out just a little,\nwell, here,\n\n167\n00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.690\nlet me just make it a little smaller and\nI'll get to that in a little bit.\n\n168\n00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.567\nYou can see there's also this\nlittle swirly arrow on the top.\n\n169\n00:07:40.567 --> 00:07:42.674\nAnd some people say, I know,\nthat's like the handle, but\n\n170\n00:07:42.674 --> 00:07:44.510\nit's actually the Rotate handle,\nwhich is fine.\n\n171\n00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:50.399\nBut it's another indication of\nthis is that particular element.\n\n172\n00:07:50.399 --> 00:07:53.753\nNow, if I wanted to not have this\nselected, you can click off of this.\n\n173\n00:07:53.753 --> 00:07:56.251\nJust like you did if\nyou had selected cells.\n\n174\n00:07:56.251 --> 00:07:59.049\nGoing back over,\nfour-pointed arrow, click once.\n\n175\n00:07:59.049 --> 00:08:01.320\nNow it is selected.\n\n176\n00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.722\nClick, hold, and drag, and I can move it.\n\n177\n00:08:03.722 --> 00:08:07.699\nSince this is an element\nthat needs another tab,\n\n178\n00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:12.810\nyou have a contextual tab up\nat the top of the format tab.\n\n179\n00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:17.240\nJust like when we were doing tables, you\nhad a design tab, and so on and so forth.\n\n180\n00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.550\nThose are tabs that are needed,\n\n181\n00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:23.350\nonce you have something that needs\nall of these different features.\n\n182\n00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:25.170\nAll righty, click off into nowhere,\n\n183\n00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:28.880\nand that's how we can\ninsert an image from File.\n\n184\n00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.990\nThere's lots of different ones\nof the files that we have.\n\n185\n00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:32.820\nAnd we'll kind of come back and\nforth through that,\n\n186\n00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:36.540\njust going into the different\nfiles that we need to insert,\n\n187\n00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:39.370\nto demonstrate all of the points.\n\n188\n00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:43.780\nFor now, we're going to move on to, how\ncan I also get pictures into my worksheet?\n\n189\n00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.530\nWe can go online.\n\n190\n00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:47.900\nLove a good old image search.\n\n191\n00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.150\nLaughter.\nSo we'll go to a pictures online,\n\n192\n00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:53.850\nand automatically it's going to default\nto using Bing as the search engine,\n\n193\n00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:56.720\nwhich is fine,\nwe'll stay within the Microsoft family.\n\n194\n00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:02.370\nBut there is something I'm just\ngonna touch on, because this is\n\n195\n00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:07.090\na bit more of a complex topic,\nbut just knowing right here,\n\n196\n00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:12.240\nyou are responsible for respecting\nothers' rights, including copyright.\n\n197\n00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.330\nAnd there's a link right here,\nthat when you click on it,\n\n198\n00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:18.940\nit will take you out to the Microsoft\nwebsite, that just talks to you about\n\n199\n00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.590\nthe legal constraints about\nusing other people's work.\n\n200\n00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:28.640\nSo the intellectual property, and really,\ndon't use pictures that aren't yours,\n\n201\n00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:34.650\nor you don't have permission to use, that\ndoesn't have a specific license on it.\n\n202\n00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:37.400\nIt can get you into a little\nbit of trouble [LAUGH] So\n\n203\n00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.860\nit's kinda just gonna talk about that.\n\n204\n00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:47.440\nNow, when we are using our insert images\nhere, let's type in birthday right there.\n\n205\n00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.280\nThen we'll hit enter.\n\n206\n00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.360\nNotice that these are the results\ntagged with a creative commons license.\n\n207\n00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.670\nReview the licenses.\n\n208\n00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:58.250\nNow show all results,\nthat's where it's like, okay, well,\n\n209\n00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:02.600\nmaybe somebody has a license on their\nphotograph

more,\n\n215\n00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:15.940\nyou have a lot more leeway,\nbecause it's for educational purposes.\n\n216\n00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:19.810\nYou're not going out there and\nputting somebody's picture...\n\n217\n00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:22.470\nSay you take a photograph and\nyou put it...\n\n218\n00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:26.290\nAnd I use it in my brochure for\nmy company...\n\n219\n00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:28.607\nAnd it's selling photography or whatever.\n\n220\n00:10:28.607 --> 00:10:31.346\nNow that right there, that's a no no.\n\n221\n00:10:31.346 --> 00:10:32.525\n&gt;&gt; That ain't cool, Vonne.\n\n222\n00:10:32.525 --> 00:10:33.345\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That ain't cool.\n\n223\n00:10:33.345 --> 00:10:35.700\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I don't have permission to use it.\n\n224\n00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.220\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Now there is that whole if I cited\n\n225\n00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:42.720\nthe source, this is from photographer\nDaniel Lowry, with his permission.\n\n226\n00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:47.740\nI've contacted you, like,\nmay I use this, those kinds of things.\n\n227\n00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.990\nNow I'm not a lawyer, so\nI am not going to go beyond that.\n\n228\n00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:54.540\nBut just saying,\njust check about these licenses.\n\n229\n00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.810\nRead up on these copyrights,\nand understand when and\n\n230\n00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:00.450\nwhere you can't use it.\n\n231\n00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:05.050\nAnd since we're using this for\ndemonstration purposes ,and we\n\n232\n00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:10.010\nare going to be using the creative commons\nlicenses, then we're going to be okay.\n\n233\n00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:11.260\nCuz I'm not sitting here,\n\n234\n00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.470\nsaying that I want to make money\noff of this kind of thing.\n\n235\n00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:16.250\nIt's not for commercial use.\n\n236\n00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:20.020\nSo you can see the different licenses,\nand so on and so forth.\n\n237\n00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:21.530\nSo read up on that.\n\n238\n00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:26.462\nAnd when in doubt, contact your lawyer.\n\n239\n00:11:26.462 --> 00:11:26.974\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n240\n00:11:26.974 --> 00:11:29.560\n&gt;&gt; Or just contact somebody, and just\n\n241\n00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:34.330\nsee what's going on with that, for your\nparticular organization and your needs.\n\n242\n00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:37.280\nOkay, so back to here, ooh,\nlet's say Happy Birthday.\n\n243\n00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.530\nI'd like to add this first one, cuz we're\ngoing to be creating an invitation for\n\n244\n00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:41.510\nFuego.\n\n245\n00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:46.800\nWe select it, we insert it, and well look\nat that, it actually says this photo is\n\n246\n00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:51.160\nunknown, and now it actually says, that's\nfine, but it's not giving me the photo.\n\n247\n00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:51.945\nWoah, sorry guys.\n\n248\n00:11:51.945 --> 00:11:55.400\n[LAUGH] So you know what,\nwe're not gonna use that one.\n\n249\n00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.280\n&gt;&gt; Try something else.\n\n250\n00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.792\n&gt;&gt; I wrote that in my notes,\nand I forgot to do that.\n\n251\n00:11:58.792 --> 00:12:00.615\n[LAUGH] I was like don't\nchoose the first one.\n\n252\n00:12:00.615 --> 00:12:01.950\n[LAUGH] That's okay.\n\n253\n00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:02.630\nWe'll try it again.\n\n254\n00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:04.080\nWe'll go to insert illustration.\n\n255\n00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.190\n&gt;&gt; Good practice, right?\n\n256\n00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:06.200\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n257\n00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.630\n&gt;&gt; You know we all mess\nup from time to time.\n\n258\n00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:11.070\n&gt;&gt; It happens.\n\n259\n00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:11.710\n&gt;&gt; I do a lot.\n\n260\n00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:14.810\nSo we'll go ahead and type in birthday.\n\n261\n00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:16.630\nWell hey, I'm glad that they fixed me.\n\n262\n00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.548\n&gt;&gt; To err is di Vonne.\n\n263\n00:12:18.548 --> 00:12:19.061\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n264\n00:12:19.061 --> 00:12:20.300\nExactly.\n\n265\n00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:21.190\nHow about this one?\n\n266\n00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:24.330\nThis one's fun,\nlet's see if this one works, perfect.\n\n267\n00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.740\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n&gt;&gt; But the other thing to notice though,\n\n268\n00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:30.530\nit is going to say,\nhey this is an unknown photo.\n\n269\n00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:35.140\nThey're adding now, and this is something\nknew, all those updates that happened.\n\n270\n00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:38.890\nLike this wasn't doing this like last\nweek, or even two weeks ago for me.\n\n271\n00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:40.970\nSo I'm like, okay,\nwell they've changed it.\n\n272\n00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:43.370\nSo it's nice that like it's\ngiving you that like citation.\n\n273\n00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:47.630\nSo if you were using it\nthat was by somebody,\n\n274\n00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:51.720\nyou would need to keep that, and\nmaybe put that down by the bottom corner.\n\n275\n00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.410\nAnd since this is an unknown author, and\nyou can also use these notice that these\n\n276\n00:12:55.410 --> 00:13:00.240\nare hyperlinks, that if I scroll down and\nclick on it, It is going to tell me\n\n277\n00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:05.030\nwhat I can do with this\nparticular license on here.\n\n278\n00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:08.610\nSo that's kind of good to\nkind of keep ya in the loop,\n\n279\n00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:10.970\nabout what everything is going on.\n\n280\n00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:12.640\nBut I'm going to come\nback over here to Excel,\n\n281\n00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:17.640\nand for this example, I'm going to scroll\nout just a little bit and zoom, so\n\n282\n00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.140\nI've got that going on,\nand that's perfect!\n\n283\n00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:21.520\nLove that little photograph.\n\n284\n00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.190\nWe'll keep this down over here.\n\n285\n00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:24.990\nThis is just this text box by the way.\n\n286\n00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:27.640\nIt is not in a cell, so\nyou can move it around,\n\n287\n00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:31.360\njust like you can in your photographs or\nyour images.\n\n288\n00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.980\nJust make sure you have\nthe four pointed arrow.\n\n289\n00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.270\nDo not get the I beam.\n\n290\n00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:38.380\nI beam means that you're trying to click\nin that text box and get the text.\n\n291\n00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:42.690\nSo watch for the box, go on the edges,\nand find the four cornered arrows, when\n\n292\n00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:46.250\nusing your photographs from online, and\nit gives you those different text boxes.\n\n293\n00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:47.120\nAll right,\n\n294\n00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:51.680\nso now I've got a couple of images in\nhere, let's talk about--oh you know what?\n\n295\n00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:55.860\nWe should do one more before\nwe get too far, screenshots!\n\n296\n00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:00.720\nBecause a screenshot is an image that\nyou can pull from another product cuz.\n\n297\n00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.210\nAgain, is Excel the place that I would\nreally be doing a lot of screenshots?\n\n298\n00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:06.850\nI'd probably be doing them more in Word,\n\n299\n00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:09.480\nbecause I want to create a handout\nof how to actually do something.\n\n300\n00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.870\nBut the thing with your screenshots\nis that, you do need to have\n\n301\n00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:21.590\nthe item that you want to go out and\ngrab, all the way like already open.\n\n302\n00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:25.790\nSo, for example, right here,\nif I have I want to copy out or\n\n303\n00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:30.260\nget a little screenshot of this\nparticular thing right here, and\n\n304\n00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.670\nwe're gonna be talking\nabout all images later.\n\n305\n00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:35.100\nSo if I want this, I get this up.\n\n306\n00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:38.030\nWe come over into Excel.\n\n307\n00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:43.100\nWe go over to Insert, we come over to\nIllustrations, and go to Screenshot.\n\n308\n00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:46.840\nNow, when I drop this down, it's just\ngonna tell me, well, what do I want, and\n\n309\n00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:50.440\nsometimes it'll actually give you\nthe windows that you have open.\n\n310\n00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.460\nIn this instance, it's not showing\nme that because I don't have that,\n\n311\n00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:57.580\nbut what I can do is come out to what's\nknown as Screen Clipping, so go and\n\n312\n00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:02.100\ntake a snapshot of your screen and It\nwill automatically add to your document.\n\n313\n00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:03.560\nI do love a screen clipping.\n\n314\n00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.010\nSo clicking on this.\n\n315\n00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:06.050\nGive it a second.\n\n316\n00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:09.100\nIt's gonna go to whatever\nwas your last active window.\n\n317\n00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:11.990\nNotice that this is the last\nthing that I've pulled up,\n\n318\n00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:14.020\nbefore I switched back to Excel.\n\n319\n00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:16.760\nThat's what I wanted to\nmake sure that I had,\n\n320\n00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:20.840\nwhen it minimized Excel and\nbrought this up.\n\n321\n00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:26.410\nSo now I've got this cross here, that\nI can use to select parts of this out,\n\n322\n00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:31.020\nso if I click, hold and\ndrag across here and let go,\n\n323\n00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:37.130\nit automatically grabs that piece,\nand then inserts it into my document.\n\n324\n00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:41.220\nReally love that handy little\nsnap screen shot clipping thing.\n\n325\n00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:42.580\nIt's fantastic!\n\n326\n00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:45.294\nWhen they added that into\nthe Office Products, I was like My God!\n\n327\n00:15:45.294 --> 00:15:47.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.\n\n328\n00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:50.007\nBecause I did non stop\nwas like making handouts.\n\n329\n00:15:50.007 --> 00:15:51.607\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And this is the step and look at this\n\n330\n00:15:51.607 --> 00:15:53.180\n&gt;&gt; I'm guessing that many other people\n\n331\n00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.199\nhave the same problem.\n\n332\n00:15:54.199 --> 00:15:55.223\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah!\n\n333\n00:15:55.223 --> 00:15:57.353\n[LAUGH] Yeah, so, Thank you, Microsoft.\n\n334\n00:15:57.353 --> 00:16:01.666\nWhen you added this,\nyou kinda changed my world so good job.\n\n335\n00:16:01.666 --> 00:16:03.820\nSo these are the different\nways that we can go ahead and\n\n336\n00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:07.570\nget images into our workbook.\n\n337\n00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:09.937\nNow we've already talked about\nmoving things around and\n\n338\n00:16:09.937 --> 00:16:11.371\ngetting that four pointed arrow.\n\n339\n00:16:11.371 --> 00:16:13.827\nSo let's come back over here to Fuego, but\n\n340\n00:16:13.827 --> 00:16:16.450\nnow I need to make Fuego\na little bit smaller.\n\n341\n00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:19.441\nHe's kind of a large picture,\nhe's kind of a large cat actually, too.\n\n342\n00:16:19.441 --> 00:16:20.526\n&gt;&gt; He's a big one.\n\n343\n00:16:20.526 --> 00:16:25.350\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH] we're supposed to not feed\nhim as much, and he just ends up just\n\n344\n00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:30.116\nknocking everything off the counters,\nand salt shakers go everywhere.\n\n345\n00:16:30.116 --> 00:16:32.454\nAnd he-\n&gt;&gt; He's a punk.\n\n346\n00:16:32.454 --> 00:16:33.497\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n347\n00:16:33.497 --> 00:16:35.659\n&gt;&gt; And he's trained us, cuz obviously,\n\n348\n00:16:35.659 --> 00:16:40.114\nokay, you're gonna stop is the only way\nto make him stop knocking everything off\n\n349\n00:16:40.114 --> 00:16:40.980\nis to feed him.\n\n350\n00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:45.760\nSo he's, yeah, we haven't him trained\nat all, [LAUGH] it's the reverse.\n\n351\n00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:50.290\nSo we've got this here,\ntwo pointed arrows, I want to resize this.\n\n352\n00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:53.302\nGo by a corner, do not go by a side.\n\n353\n00:16:53.302 --> 00:16:56.430\nCuz if I go by the corner,\nI don't even have to hold anything.\n\n354\n00:16:56.430 --> 00:17:00.026\nYou just click, hold, and drag, and it's\ngoing to maintain that aspect ratio, okay?\n\n355\n00:17:00.026 --> 00:17:02.670\nIt's not gonna squash the photograph.\n\n356\n00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:06.813\nAnd if I make this bigger, now making this\nbigger here isn't gonna be a big deal.\n\n357\n00:17:06.813 --> 00:17:08.680\nSorry, I think I, there we go.\n\n358\n00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.890\nIt's not going to change the make it\nblurry like we talked about before,\n\n359\n00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:14.810\nbecause this was big enough to begin with.\n\n360\n00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:17.244\nAnd it doesn't,\nwhat's known as resampling.\n\n361\n00:17:17.244 --> 00:17:18.781\nYou don't have to know the, well,\n\n362\n00:17:18.781 --> 00:17:21.700\nthe definition of resampling is\nchange the number of pixels.\n\n363\n00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:25.280\nIt kept all of that in there,\nand it didn't change that, so\n\n364\n00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.855\nI can make it bigger or\nsmaller all day long.\n\n365\n00:17:27.855 --> 00:17:30.680\nCuz if you go by a side,\nand if I click, hold, and\n\n366\n00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:35.000\ndrag in, that is a no no,\ndon't squash your pictures.\n\n367\n00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.330\nThat's something I can\npick out immediately.\n\n368\n00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:41.832\nI see a handout or something, I'm like,\nyou didn't keep the aspect ratio,\n\n369\n00:17:41.832 --> 00:17:43.872\nyou didn't keep your proportions.\n\n370\n00:17:43.872 --> 00:17:46.908\nAnd I was like, ugh, so\nthat's kind of a big pet peeve of mine.\n\n371\n00:17:46.908 --> 00:17:48.511\nDon't do that, grab a corner.\n\n372\n00:17:48.511 --> 00:17:52.640\nAll right, so I can resize my photographs,\nI can move them around.\n\n373\n00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:57.950\nYou can also rotate them, that's why\nyou have that rotating handle up there.\n\n374\n00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:02.435\nIf I click, hold, and drag, because maybe\nyou wanna kinda put this to an angle for\n\n375\n00:18:02.435 --> 00:18:04.467\na little bit, I can-\n&gt;&gt; Make it fun.\n\n376\n00:18:04.467 --> 00:18:08.271\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just, hm, that's good [LAUGH].\n\n377\n00:18:08.271 --> 00:18:12.190\nSo I can rotate that around,\nand wonderful.\n\n378\n00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.824\nLet's get a few more\nother pictures in here.\n\n379\n00:18:14.824 --> 00:18:17.180\nI'm going to go back over\nto Insert &gt; Pictures.\n\n380\n00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.814\nAnd just to demonstrate that point,\nif I go to Mr.\n\n381\n00:18:19.814 --> 00:18:23.723\nBishop and insert this like,\nyou're like, need a bigger picture.\n\n382\n00:18:23.723 --> 00:18:27.900\nMake that bigger, mm-mm,\nthat's not gonna work, okay?\n\n383\n00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.851\nThat's when I would ask somebody if\nthey had a bigger photograph, and\n\n384\n00:18:30.851 --> 00:18:32.911\nthen they're like,\nwhat do you mean, bigger?\n\n385\n00:18:32.911 --> 00:18:35.237\nBut, eh, it's a battle.\n\n386\n00:18:35.237 --> 00:18:38.133\nThen you have to say, I need more\npixels in like, where you have,\n\n387\n00:18:38.133 --> 00:18:39.619\nlook at your little dimensions.\n\n388\n00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:44.702\nAnd sometimes, you don't have any\ncontrol over that, so we wanna try\n\n389\n00:18:44.702 --> 00:18:50.147\nto get as many pixels as possible,\nbecause more is better most of the time.\n\n390\n00:18:50.147 --> 00:18:52.588\nThere's an asterisk to\nall of this [LAUGH].\n\n391\n00:18:52.588 --> 00:18:54.190\nAll right, so I've got another picture.\n\n392\n00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:59.012\nLets get one more in there for fun.\n\n393\n00:18:59.012 --> 00:18:59.956\nLet's do this one.\n\n394\n00:18:59.956 --> 00:19:02.290\nSo we'll go here, it's a flower.\n\n395\n00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:08.191\nAnd this is kind of big, so I'm just\ngonna grab a corner, size that down.\n\n396\n00:19:08.191 --> 00:19:09.660\nAnd then I'm also gonna get another one.\n\n397\n00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:13.614\nWe're gonna go to Insert &gt; Illustrations\nand Pictures, and then it's flower.\n\n398\n00:19:13.614 --> 00:19:16.750\nAnd you see the black back there?\n\n399\n00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:20.690\nI'm just gonna stop for a second to say,\ndo you see how this one, this flower,\n\n400\n00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:24.610\nthis is a JPG and this is GIF?\n\n401\n00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:29.862\nAnd I get this a lot of times where people\nlike, why do I have a white background?\n\n402\n00:19:29.862 --> 00:19:34.850\nDo you see how on this one, there see\nthroughness around versus this one,\n\n403\n00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:36.790\nwhere you get the white box?\n\n404\n00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:38.480\nAnd [INAUDIBLE] the white box.\n\n405\n00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.750\nWell, that's because of the file formats.\n\n406\n00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:45.790\nJPEG does not allow for transparency,\nGIF does allow for transparency.\n\n407\n00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:51.780\nSo that could be a reason why I really,\njust, I can't get the edge around.\n\n408\n00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:52.981\n[INAUDIBLE] I can't see the edge.\n\n409\n00:19:52.981 --> 00:19:54.431\nI'm like?\n\n410\n00:19:54.431 --> 00:19:59.289\nYeah, they were talking about\ndifferent file formats of GIF or PNG,\n\n411\n00:19:59.289 --> 00:20:01.734\nthere could be a PNG,versus JPG.\n\n412\n00:20:01.734 --> 00:20:05.976\nAnd that's just the whole nature of\ndifferent file types to support different\n\n413\n00:20:05.976 --> 00:20:07.295\ntypes of information.\n\n414\n00:20:07.295 --> 00:20:13.200\nJPGs just can't do it, so you will\nalways get some type of background.\n\n415\n00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.730\nWhether you think it looks like\nthere's nothing there, it is there.\n\n416\n00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:18.659\nAll right, so different types of pictures.\n\n417\n00:20:18.659 --> 00:20:21.450\nWe've talked about moving,\nwe've talked about resizing.\n\n418\n00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:23.800\nWhat if I wanted to flip them?\n\n419\n00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.797\nNow this picture of Fuego,\nthat's just bothering me,\n\n420\n00:20:26.797 --> 00:20:28.935\nwe gotta get rid of that [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n421\n00:20:28.935 --> 00:20:30.675\n&gt;&gt; This picture of Fuego,\n\n422\n00:20:30.675 --> 00:20:33.210\nhe's on the right hand side.\n\n423\n00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:37.440\nBut if I wanted to flip\nit to just turn it over,\n\n424\n00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:42.210\nI can select it up here on\nthe Format tab there is Rotate.\n\n425\n00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:47.014\nNow with this way he's looking, it kind\nof looks a little off, but [LAUGH].\n\n426\n00:20:47.014 --> 00:20:48.778\n&gt;&gt; It's a whole lot funnier for\nsome reason [LAUGH].\n\n427\n00:20:48.778 --> 00:20:51.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, it's like,\nwhat's going on here?\n\n428\n00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:56.099\nSo there is one picture that I\nthink this illustrates pretty well.\n\n429\n00:20:56.099 --> 00:21:00.250\nThis is when we were in Columbia,\nso the flag is going this way.\n\n430\n00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:01.569\nIf I rotate this horizontal,\n\n431\n00:21:01.569 --> 00:21:04.059\nwell now it just looks like\nit's flowing the other way.\n\n432\n00:21:04.059 --> 00:21:06.330\nSo that one doesn't look as weird.\n\n433\n00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:11.050\n&gt;&gt; Does it affect text at all,\ndo you have to worry about a mirror image?\n\n434\n00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:12.840\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nIf I was doing this one,\n\n435\n00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:17.230\nif I rotated this, I mean,\nit's gonna be backwards [LAUGH].\n\n436\n00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:20.310\nSo, but it is nice to know that\nyou can flip it horizontal or\n\n437\n00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:25.780\nflip it vertical, of you needed to\nkind of change which way it's going.\n\n438\n00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:29.139\nAnd some do better than others [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n439\n00:21:29.139 --> 00:21:31.727\n&gt;&gt; Right there, so we've got that.\n\n440\n00:21:31.727 --> 00:21:34.721\nAll right, so,\nsome alignment that we can do.\n\n441\n00:21:34.721 --> 00:21:38.255\nLet's go here and select this picture.\n\n442\n00:21:38.255 --> 00:21:40.442\nOkay, and I'm gonna kinda move\nthis stuff over to the side.\n\n443\n00:21:40.442 --> 00:21:44.850\nI want these two pictures to be aligned.\n\n444\n00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:47.120\nNow this is where do I\nwant to align the tops?\n\n445\n00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:48.800\nDo I want to align the bottoms?\n\n446\n00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.840\nDo I want to align where the middles go?\n\n447\n00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:52.900\nWhat if they were on top of each other?\n\n448\n00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:57.000\nI want to make sure the centers\nare aligned, or the rights are aligned.\n\n449\n00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.760\nHow do I select multiple images?\n\n450\n00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.228\nYou use your Shift key.\n\n451\n00:22:02.228 --> 00:22:06.392\nIf you hold your Shift key down, I've\nselected one image, hold the Shift key,\n\n452\n00:22:06.392 --> 00:22:08.146\nsingle-click on the other one.\n\n453\n00:22:08.146 --> 00:22:12.820\nOnce I get two images,\nup here on the Format tab,\n\n454\n00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:16.300\nyou have the option for Align.\n\n455\n00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.420\nNow align what?\n\n456\n00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:22.310\nAnd you can see the little icons here that\ndo you want to align the left hand sides?\n\n457\n00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:23.470\nDo you want to align the middles?\n\n458\n00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:26.542\nDo you want to align the rights,\ntops, middles, bottoms?\n\n459\n00:22:26.542 --> 00:22:32.200\nOkay, so you have to think about what kind\nof, well, how are they aligned [LAUGH].\n\n460\n00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.838\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; How are they arranged, and\n\n461\n00:22:33.838 --> 00:22:34.990\nwhich one do I want to go.\n\n462\n00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:41.760\nSo if I choose let's align lefts, notice\nthat it also aligns to the left-est image.\n\n463\n00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:45.520\nSo now our left sides\nare aligned versus our centers.\n\n464\n00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:46.790\nNow my centers are aligned.\n\n465\n00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:49.960\nIf I had put them this way,\nhold my Shift key,\n\n466\n00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:54.060\nclick that one, now that's where\nthe top and the middles and\n\n467\n00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:59.850\nthe bottoms are going to make it,\ncuz those are across versus going down.\n\n468\n00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:01.580\nSo I could go with that.\n\n469\n00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:05.690\nThere's a few other little things that you\ncould do here in this particular episode.\n\n470\n00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:10.626\nNotice here, let's say I wanted to have\nthe photograph or the, what is this?\n\n471\n00:23:10.626 --> 00:23:13.266\nThe flower, [LAUGH] on top of the flag and\n\n472\n00:23:13.266 --> 00:23:18.154\nkind of make it a little kind of cute\nlittle flower in the hair of the flag.\n\n473\n00:23:18.154 --> 00:23:19.008\n&gt;&gt; Sky?\n[LAUGH]\n\n474\n00:23:19.008 --> 00:23:20.249\n&gt;&gt; I have no idea, I'm just rolling.\n\n475\n00:23:20.249 --> 00:23:23.323\n&gt;&gt; You just want over the other,\nand if it's not giving you that,\n\n476\n00:23:23.323 --> 00:23:24.440\nhow do we change it?\n\n477\n00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.060\n&gt;&gt; Correct, thank you [LAUGH].\n\n478\n00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:28.167\nWe're gonna go with stacking order.\n\n479\n00:23:28.167 --> 00:23:32.403\nSo everything has a order in\nwhich they were inserted, and\n\n480\n00:23:32.403 --> 00:23:35.900\nthat gives you that layers, basically.\n\n481\n00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:39.950\nSo bringing this to the front,\nor taking the flag and\n\n482\n00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:42.540\npushing it to the back,\nwhichever one you wanna go with.\n\n483\n00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:47.224\nSince I have the flower,\nif I come over here to these buttons,\n\n484\n00:23:47.224 --> 00:23:50.300\nI have Bring Forward or Send Backwards.\n\n485\n00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:53.422\nNow in this sense, you're like there's\na drop down, what's the difference?\n\n486\n00:23:53.422 --> 00:23:58.086\nWell, if you had a couple of them, if\nthere was three The third one, second one,\n\n487\n00:23:58.086 --> 00:24:02.977\nI don't have another hand, but [LAUGH] if\nI say bring forward, it's just one level.\n\n488\n00:24:02.977 --> 00:24:04.560\nSo that would go from three to two.\n\n489\n00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.720\nAnd there's still one on top of that.\n\n490\n00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:09.854\nBut if I said bring the three\nall the way to the front,\n\n491\n00:24:09.854 --> 00:24:13.170\nthen that goes in front of\nwhat was one and becomes one.\n\n492\n00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:14.760\nSo that's the difference there.\n\n493\n00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.920\nIn this sense, we're just gonna say\nbring it all the way to the front,\n\n494\n00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.850\ncuz I don't know what\nlevel we're on right now.\n\n495\n00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:23.750\nSo we're going to take that, and so that's\nwhere you can change your stacking order.\n\n496\n00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:27.911\nAnd while I'm at it, if I wanted these\ntwo items to now be grouped together,\n\n497\n00:24:27.911 --> 00:24:32.527\nwe're also gonna be talking about this in\nthe shapes when we get into the different,\n\n498\n00:24:32.527 --> 00:24:33.454\nwell, shapes.\n\n499\n00:24:33.454 --> 00:24:36.697\n[LAUGH] So group them together\nif you select both of them,\n\n500\n00:24:36.697 --> 00:24:38.550\nholding that Shift key.\n\n501\n00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:42.819\nComing over to your Format,\nyou can go ahead and\n\n502\n00:24:42.819 --> 00:24:47.527\nchoose Group, and\nthen it acts as one whole entity.\n\n503\n00:24:47.527 --> 00:24:51.890\nSo that could be quite fun,\nwe can move that around.\n\n504\n00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:55.640\nA few other things in this episode to\nkind of finish up our images basics,\n\n505\n00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:58.620\nthen we'll get into all the different\nthings with the formats.\n\n506\n00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:00.152\nI wanna talk about cropping.\n\n507\n00:25:00.152 --> 00:25:03.691\nSo, and we're gonna flip him back over,\nokay, [LAUGH].\n\n508\n00:25:03.691 --> 00:25:07.949\nI think cuz I've looked at this picture so\nlong that this is the only way I see it,\n\n509\n00:25:07.949 --> 00:25:10.125\nand he does look a little weird that way.\n\n510\n00:25:10.125 --> 00:25:11.355\nSo we're gonna take this picture.\n\n511\n00:25:11.355 --> 00:25:17.807\nMaybe I don't need all of the tree\nover here, maybe I just need his face.\n\n512\n00:25:17.807 --> 00:25:20.506\nThat's where we can crop it.\n\n513\n00:25:20.506 --> 00:25:23.993\nI remember back in the old school, it was\nlike, mm, you have a picture of you and\n\n514\n00:25:23.993 --> 00:25:25.984\nyour best friend or\nboyfriend or something.\n\n515\n00:25:25.984 --> 00:25:27.071\nAnd then you guys break up.\n\n516\n00:25:27.071 --> 00:25:27.791\n&gt;&gt; It didn't really work out.\n\n517\n00:25:27.791 --> 00:25:29.381\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yep, you take out the scissors.\n\n518\n00:25:29.381 --> 00:25:31.911\n&gt;&gt; The old style crop,\nchop, chop, chop, right?\n\n519\n00:25:31.911 --> 00:25:34.719\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, cuz my hair was\nreally looking good that day, and\n\n520\n00:25:34.719 --> 00:25:38.504\nthat was a great picture of me, but now\nhe's not in the picture, he's going away.\n\n521\n00:25:38.504 --> 00:25:40.017\n&gt;&gt; He's literally not in the picture now.\n\n522\n00:25:40.017 --> 00:25:43.203\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, yeah, no,\n\n523\n00:25:43.203 --> 00:25:44.634\nI never did that.\n\n524\n00:25:44.634 --> 00:25:46.640\n[LAUGH] They usually\ninvolved a lot of crying.\n\n525\n00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.190\nSo we have here cropping.\n\n526\n00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:54.834\nYou select the photograph on the Format\ntab, you come over here to Crop.\n\n527\n00:25:54.834 --> 00:25:56.490\nAnd you can drop this down.\n\n528\n00:25:56.490 --> 00:26:00.020\nNow there's a couple other options we'll\ntalk about with the shapes and everything.\n\n529\n00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:03.942\nBut if you just choose Crop by itself,\nit puts on these little, well,\n\n530\n00:26:03.942 --> 00:26:05.413\nthey look just like that.\n\n531\n00:26:05.413 --> 00:26:08.853\n[LAUGH] And\nyou want to change what you wanna see, and\n\n532\n00:26:08.853 --> 00:26:11.340\nit's not gonna change the picture.\n\n533\n00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:15.348\nBasically, just saying push in the sand,\nI'm gonna grab the side.\n\n534\n00:26:15.348 --> 00:26:18.979\nI wanna crop out that tree,\nmaybe pull this down.\n\n535\n00:26:18.979 --> 00:26:23.038\nWe do this with setting your default\nimage in Facebook or whatever,\n\n536\n00:26:23.038 --> 00:26:24.327\nyour cover picture.\n\n537\n00:26:24.327 --> 00:26:27.036\nI mean, they have it kind of\nfit into this little space.\n\n538\n00:26:27.036 --> 00:26:30.925\nSo, hopefully, maybe you've been\nfamiliar with this in other areas,\n\n539\n00:26:30.925 --> 00:26:34.190\nlike your phone and so\non and stuff like that.\n\n540\n00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:37.810\nSo I'll take this,\nget it to where I want, that's perfect.\n\n541\n00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:40.900\nNow I could change\nthe picture within the crop.\n\n542\n00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:43.990\nSee, that's changing\nthe size of the photo,\n\n543\n00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:47.055\nrather than changing\nthe size of the frame.\n\n544\n00:26:47.055 --> 00:26:50.795\nSo as soon as you get it to where you\nlike, if you just either click off or\n\n545\n00:26:50.795 --> 00:26:54.287\nhit the Enter key or\njust click off because Enter didn't work,\n\n546\n00:26:54.287 --> 00:26:55.745\n[LAUGH] different program.\n\n547\n00:26:55.745 --> 00:27:00.355\nSo you can see that now I have\ncropped out that part of Fuego.\n\n548\n00:27:00.355 --> 00:27:03.308\nNow it didn't remove,\nI'm not removing the image,\n\n549\n00:27:03.308 --> 00:27:07.505\nit's almost like I'm putting it in a mat\nin a photograph in a frame, right,\n\n550\n00:27:07.505 --> 00:27:10.450\njust kind of have\neverything else behind it.\n\n551\n00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:14.510\nSo if I went back in to Crop,\nnotice it's all still there, so\n\n552\n00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:18.630\nnot deleting,\njust hiding what I want to see.\n\n553\n00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:22.455\nAnd if I don't like that,\nI can always come back over to here, and\n\n554\n00:27:22.455 --> 00:27:25.183\nI can extend this out, and oops, hello.\n\n555\n00:27:25.183 --> 00:27:26.403\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, let's not do that,\n\n556\n00:27:26.403 --> 00:27:28.260\nlet's go ahead and click off into nowhere.\n\n557\n00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:30.953\nAnd then we have here,\nand then we crop it.\n\n558\n00:27:30.953 --> 00:27:32.479\nAll right, perfect,\n\n559\n00:27:32.479 --> 00:27:37.375\nso, and then the other thing that maybe\nI might have done time to time is,\n\n560\n00:27:37.375 --> 00:27:42.859\nyou cut out a heart in construction paper,\nthen put the person inside the heart.\n\n561\n00:27:42.859 --> 00:27:43.713\nDid you ever do that?\n\n562\n00:27:43.713 --> 00:27:44.398\nNo, sorry.\n\n563\n00:27:44.398 --> 00:27:46.164\n&gt;&gt; I can't say that I've had the pleasure.\n\n564\n00:27:46.164 --> 00:27:47.448\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n565\n00:27:47.448 --> 00:27:50.124\nyou weren't a girl in middle school,\nwere you?\n\n566\n00:27:50.124 --> 00:27:53.616\n&gt;&gt; No, I always wondered how you get\nall the mascara marks off of things.\n\n567\n00:27:53.616 --> 00:27:58.393\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, okay, so, I think\nthere's some different experiences here.\n\n568\n00:27:58.393 --> 00:28:01.795\nAnd I mean, this is back when I'm\ncutting up construction paper, I mean,\n\n569\n00:28:01.795 --> 00:28:03.904\nnow we have computers,\nbut I'm not that old.\n\n570\n00:28:03.904 --> 00:28:09.005\nOkay, so we get here, if I wanted to\ncrop this into a particular shape,\n\n571\n00:28:09.005 --> 00:28:14.206\nnotice that we have some different\nshapes that we can have this picture.\n\n572\n00:28:14.206 --> 00:28:17.045\nCuz maybe we wanna put Fuego\nin a cute little heart.\n\n573\n00:28:17.045 --> 00:28:19.170\nAw, look at that cute guy.\n\n574\n00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:22.622\nNow, the thing is,\nthe picture's kind of off center,\n\n575\n00:28:22.622 --> 00:28:25.971\nI end up kinda move-\n&gt;&gt; His face isn't quite making it into\n\n576\n00:28:25.971 --> 00:28:26.840\nthe fill there.\n\n577\n00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.460\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, [LAUGH] so the nice thing that you\n\n578\n00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:33.011\ncan do when you crop it into shape\nis you have the option in here.\n\n579\n00:28:33.011 --> 00:28:35.613\nYou see, we have fill, and you have fit.\n\n580\n00:28:35.613 --> 00:28:40.544\nAnd so now if I choose fill, you see\nI went ahead and took the picture and\n\n581\n00:28:40.544 --> 00:28:43.320\nput it into that particular area.\n\n582\n00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:48.497\nAnd if I did fit, now this particular\npicture is trying to fit the edge,\n\n583\n00:28:48.497 --> 00:28:54.040\nthe width of it, but it's kind of going\noff the top of the heart right there.\n\n584\n00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:56.850\nSo you can see there,\nit's gonna kinda cut off.\n\n585\n00:28:56.850 --> 00:29:00.115\nSo you do have to kinda think about, okay,\n\n586\n00:29:00.115 --> 00:29:05.753\nif I take these little guys here,\nthat's changing the size of the shape.\n\n587\n00:29:05.753 --> 00:29:11.950\nAnd then if I get inside of it,\nI can move the picture within that.\n\n588\n00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:14.512\nOkay, now since there's not a lot of room,\n\n589\n00:29:14.512 --> 00:29:17.639\nif you wanna say,\noff to the right of the photograph.\n\n590\n00:29:17.639 --> 00:29:20.633\nSo I gotta kinda play around with okay,\nperfect,\n\n591\n00:29:20.633 --> 00:29:24.359\nI don't want to get out of the heart,\nI wanna keep it in there.\n\n592\n00:29:24.359 --> 00:29:29.280\nAnd that's where I can crop it\ninto that particular shape.\n\n593\n00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.676\nAnd so that's really kind of cute.\n\n594\n00:29:31.676 --> 00:29:36.008\nI love that, my cute little Fuego pants\nright there, so put him in a heart and\n\n595\n00:29:36.008 --> 00:29:36.770\nthere we go.\n\n596\n00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:40.110\nSo I think that's probably a good\nplace to stop with the image basics.\n\n597\n00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:42.890\nThere was one I wanted to cut\nwith the remove the background.\n\n598\n00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:44.090\nBut you know what?\n\n599\n00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:46.465\nI know you're giving me\nthe signals over there, like hey,\n\n600\n00:29:46.465 --> 00:29:47.760\nI think it's time to wrap it up.\n\n601\n00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:52.200\nSo that's okay, because we have another\nepisode coming up with the format.\n\n602\n00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:53.540\nSo I'll just throw\nthe background in there.\n\n603\n00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:54.550\n&gt;&gt; Chuck it on the fire there.\n\n604\n00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:58.114\nI wish I had one of those wrap it\nup music boxes, that's what I need.\n\n605\n00:29:58.114 --> 00:30:00.696\n[LAUGH] Get off the stage.\n\n606\n00:30:00.696 --> 00:30:02.755\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know how long it's taken\n\n607\n00:30:02.755 --> 00:30:03.300\nme to get here?\n\n608\n00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:04.435\nI'm going to keep going.\n\n609\n00:30:04.435 --> 00:30:06.574\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Can you stop thanking everyone you've\n\n610\n00:30:06.574 -->

to another\ngreat episode of OfficeProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.310\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.480\nAnd in today's episode it is more\nin our Excel 2016 Advanced Series.\n\n6\n00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.890\nI've been having a lot of good times so\nfar.\n\n7\n00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.846\nHopefully you have as well because guess\nwho's joining us back in the studio?\n\n8\n00:00:20.846 --> 00:00:22.760\nNone other than Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.390\nVonne, glad to have you yet again.\n\n10\n00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.191\nHow are you today?\n\n11\n00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:25.828\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n12\n00:00:25.828 --> 00:00:26.705\n&gt;&gt; I felt like I had to do some type of\n\n13\n00:00:26.705 --> 00:00:27.933\npose on that one with that introduction.\n\n14\n00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:28.713\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Ta-da!\n\n15\n00:00:28.713 --> 00:00:29.476\n&gt;&gt; Here I am.\n\n16\n00:00:29.476 --> 00:00:31.062\n&gt;&gt; We need to get some pyro.\n\n17\n00:00:31.062 --> 00:00:32.959\n[SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\n\n18\n00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:33.527\n&gt;&gt; And some smoke.\n\n19\n00:00:33.527 --> 00:00:34.031\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n\n20\n00:00:34.031 --> 00:00:34.545\n&gt;&gt; That'd be awesome.\n\n21\n00:00:34.545 --> 00:00:35.789\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [SOUND].\n\n22\n00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:37.737\n&gt;&gt; I've been trying to get a budget for\nthat.\n\n23\n00:00:37.737 --> 00:00:39.398\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So far no luck.\n\n24\n00:00:39.398 --> 00:00:42.318\n&gt;&gt; Man, [LAUGH] Well we are continuing on.\n\n25\n00:00:42.318 --> 00:00:45.601\nNow, this isn't a part two\nbecause we do a lot of part twos.\n\n26\n00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:47.423\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But I decided to go ahead and\n\n27\n00:00:47.423 --> 00:00:52.270\nbreak it up into individual titles\nrather than a part one and part two.\n\n28\n00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.966\nBut this is pretty much a continuation\nfrom the images basics episode.\n\n29\n00:00:56.966 --> 00:01:00.285\nSo if you haven't watched that,\nI'd definitely suggest you go back in and\n\n30\n00:01:00.285 --> 00:01:01.330\ncheck that out.\n\n31\n00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.820\nAnd one of the things that we last left\noff on in that particular episode was\n\n32\n00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.820\nthe remove background.\n\n33\n00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:07.456\nAll right, so\n\n34\n00:01:07.456 --> 00:01:10.531\nwe kind of started running out of\ntime cuz I love to talk about images.\n\n35\n00:01:10.531 --> 00:01:11.877\nSo I was like, I'll just go ahead and\n\n36\n00:01:11.877 --> 00:01:14.800\nput it in the format because that's\nexactly what we're doing in this episode.\n\n37\n00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:21.110\nWe're gonna be formatting the images\nthat we have in our Excel workbook.\n\n38\n00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.039\nLast episode, we just kinda got them\nin there, resized them, cropped them.\n\n39\n00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:29.227\nNow we're gonna go ahead and,\nalmost like put in like the smoke machine.\n\n40\n00:01:29.227 --> 00:01:29.977\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All the kinda pyrotechnics,\n\n41\n00:01:29.977 --> 00:01:32.490\nwe're gonna-\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna jazz it up.\n\n42\n00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.740\n&gt;&gt; My gosh.\n&gt;&gt; My goodness.\n\n43\n00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.042\n&gt;&gt; Jinx.\n&gt;&gt; Get out of my brain.\n\n44\n00:01:35.042 --> 00:01:36.307\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Get out of my brain.\n\n45\n00:01:36.307 --> 00:01:38.609\n&gt;&gt; That was kind of amazing.\n\n46\n00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:40.789\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, right on cue.\n\n47\n00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.858\nLike yes, we're gonna add some\npieces of flare in here and\n\n48\n00:01:44.858 --> 00:01:48.075\ngussy this up a little bit, so-\n&gt;&gt; Let the gussying begin.\n\n49\n00:01:48.075 --> 00:01:49.882\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I have the file that we were\n\n50\n00:01:49.882 --> 00:01:53.510\nleft off on in that particular episode,\nwe have graphics.xlsx.\n\n51\n00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.944\nAnd I had actually just went ahead and\nadded a new worksheet,\n\n52\n00:01:56.944 --> 00:02:00.462\nright before we started to go\non camera to get these pictures.\n\n53\n00:02:00.462 --> 00:02:02.690\nWe were working on the insert images.\n\n54\n00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.540\nSo I actually left it right like it\nwas before in our other episode.\n\n55\n00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.320\nBut I wanted to set this up to\ntalk about Remove Background.\n\n56\n00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.990\nWe mentioned the whole JPEG\nversus the GIF file format and\n\n57\n00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.380\nhaving that transparency that I wanted to\nhave around the edge of the photograph.\n\n58\n00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.270\nSo there's something in all of\nyour Office products known as\n\n59\n00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.132\nremove background within our\nFormat tab on our contextual tab.\n\n60\n00:02:31.132 --> 00:02:34.372\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now, this is really cool and it works\n\n61\n00:02:34.372 --> 00:02:39.540\nreally great on examples that are perfect\nto show you how it works flawlessly.\n\n62\n00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.438\n[LAUGH] And then you go on another one and\nyou're like, that didn't work.\n\n63\n00:02:43.438 --> 00:02:44.370\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] At all.\n\n64\n00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.250\n&gt;&gt; That's not gonna do so well.\n\n65\n00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.448\nSo I have a perfect example, and\n\n66\n00:02:48.448 --> 00:02:52.933\nthen this is what your gonna need\nto kind of watch for, all right?\n\n67\n00:02:52.933 --> 00:02:56.470\nAnd it does exactly what it says,\nremove the background.\n\n68\n00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.040\nHow do I do it?\n\n69\n00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.590\nYou select the image, you come over\nhere to remove the background,\n\n70\n00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.430\nbecause maybe I don't want the white box,\nwithin this JPEG file.\n\n71\n00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.730\nSo if you remove the background,\n\n72\n00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.330\nit's going to automatically remove\nunwanted portions of the image.\n\n73\n00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.290\nSo if I click on this,\n\n74\n00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.940\ngive it a second, cuz it will,\nthere, that's what I was waiting for.\n\n75\n00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.418\nNow, this might be not the best\nexample because I'm using a kinda\n\n76\n00:03:18.418 --> 00:03:20.053\nmagenta color flower.\n\n77\n00:03:20.053 --> 00:03:23.732\nAnd the background where it's telling you\nwhat it's removing is magenta as well.\n\n78\n00:03:23.732 --> 00:03:26.848\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it's kinda hard to see, but\n\n79\n00:03:26.848 --> 00:03:32.650\nwhat it's doing is automatically\ndetecting the areas that are different.\n\n80\n00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.980\nLike all right, well,\nthere is the white and then the pink.\n\n81\n00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.920\nBut look at here if I zoom in on this.\n\n82\n00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.160\nDo you see right there?\n\n83\n00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.770\nAgain, not the best example,\n\n84\n00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.770\nbut this is showing me that it is gonna\nstart removing that particular part.\n\n85\n00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.470\nJust to say like, let's see what\nhappens and just say keep all changes.\n\n86\n00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.204\nIt's going to remove and it did,\nbut did you see how it did what?\n\n87\n00:03:57.204 --> 00:04:02.500\nIt cut off those portions of the flower.\n\n88\n00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.768\nEverything else is transparent, so what\nyou need to do is you need to be able to\n\n89\n00:04:06.768 --> 00:04:13.090\nmark the pieces that you want to keep, or\nmark the places that you want to remove.\n\n90\n00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.414\nSo if I undo, I just did a Ctrl+Z.\n\n91\n00:04:17.414 --> 00:04:21.870\nIf I go to remove background and\nthen give it a second to go ahead and\n\n92\n00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.662\nlet itself recognize it.\n\n93\n00:04:23.662 --> 00:04:28.176\nNotice up here, it's almost like taking,\ndo you remember back in the,\n\n94\n00:04:28.176 --> 00:04:32.230\nyou have to take an X-ACTO knife\nto cut the pictures out of it.\n\n95\n00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.755\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n96\n00:04:32.755 --> 00:04:33.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n97\n00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.440\nSo it's kinda like taking that X-ACTO\nknife and saying, no, keep this, nope,\n\n98\n00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.600\ngo ahead and put that back in and\nthe nice thing is this is digital.\n\n99\n00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if you make a mistake,\nyou can just back up.\n\n100\n00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.920\nWith an X-ACTO knife, not so forgiving.\n\n101\n00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.986\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, not so much.\n\n102\n00:04:45.986 --> 00:04:47.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So and you up here,\n\n103\n00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.380\nyou can use mark the areas to keep.\n\n104\n00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.410\nAnd then if I draw just kinda of like\nkinda draw my pencil around here,\n\n105\n00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.073\nto say keep that area.\n\n106\n00:04:58.073 --> 00:05:01.358\nYou see how it actually said,\nokay, I'll go ahead and\n\n107\n00:05:01.358 --> 00:05:03.560\nkeep that and I can do the same up here.\n\n108\n00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.115\nSo all right,\nwe'll keep that little area, and\n\n109\n00:05:08.115 --> 00:05:11.630\nit will recognize,\ngo ahead and keep that area.\n\n110\n00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.173\nAnd then keep this area,\n\n111\n00:05:15.173 --> 00:05:20.080\njust let it go, okay, perfect.\n\n112\n00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.375\nNow if I keep the changes, wow, that's\nperfect, it works flawlessly, [LAUGH].\n\n113\n00:05:24.375 --> 00:05:26.499\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A, and the other thing that is,\n\n114\n00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:29.470\nsometimes it will just go ahead and\ndo it by itself.\n\n115\n00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.522\nNow, this is the original photo that I had\ntaken before I actually did all of these\n\n116\n00:05:33.522 --> 00:05:35.259\ndifferent changes in Photoshop.\n\n117\n00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:38.756\nSo if I was to go ahead and\ntake the remove background,\n\n118\n00:05:38.756 --> 00:05:41.550\nit's not actually marking anything.\n\n119\n00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.680\nIt's like, did it do anything, it did.\n\n120\n00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.470\nRemember, this right here, remember,\nthat's the color of the flower.\n\n121\n00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.020\nThat is not the, okay,\nit's gonna remove that.\n\n122\n00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.155\nI'm sorry my computer is freaking out,\nit's kind of.\n\n123\n00:05:56.155 --> 00:06:02.154\nWe have some larger images going on here.\n\n124\n00:06:02.154 --> 00:06:04.585\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So that's why it's doing it,\n\n125\n00:06:04.585 --> 00:06:09.070\nif I keep all the changes like,\nagain, that worked pretty well.\n\n126\n00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.065\nIt cut out everything that I needed and\nit kept that other back flower, so\n\n127\n00:06:13.065 --> 00:06:15.830\nit detected everything,\nlet's try Mr. Fuego.\n\n128\n00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:16.666\n&gt;&gt; Give that a whirly gig.\n\n129\n00:06:16.666 --> 00:06:19.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but look at what's going\non in this particular picture.\n\n130\n00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.010\nThere's so many colors going on in here.\n\n131\n00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.850\nThere's some white up here in the clouds,\n\n132\n00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.340\nthere's white on Fuego,\nthere's some dark parts on him.\n\n133\n00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.080\nSo if I, and I'm just gonna zoom\nin a little bit for you guys.\n\n134\n00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.899\nI'm gonna move over so we can see this.\n\n135\n00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.010\nIf I choose to remove background,\nthis is where it's gonna detect, and\n\n136\n00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:39.670\nlike gosh look at, he looks pretty scary,\nlook at his eyeballs.\n\n137\n00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:40.480\nGosh, I'm so sorry.\n\n138\n00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.980\n&gt;&gt; It's horrifying [LAUGH].\n\n139\n00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.180\n&gt;&gt; This is kind of like how he\nlooks when he's really hungry, and\n\n140\n00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.190\nlike you need to feed me now.\n\n141\n00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.180\nSo this is where it's\nnot gonna do a perfect\n\n142\n00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.870\nexample of how it auto-detect\nwhere these edges are.\n\n143\n00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:58.050\nSo coming into mark areas to keep,\nwell, I wanna keep his little eyeballs.\n\n144\n00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.985\nSo if I go ahead and circle around them.\n\n145\n00:07:00.985 --> 00:07:04.626\nAnd then maybe go ahead and\ncircle down through his paws and\n\n146\n00:07:04.626 --> 00:07:07.236\nsay, let's go ahead and keep this area.\n\n147\n00:07:07.236 --> 00:07:11.230\nAnd it's doing pretty good,\nbut now I wanna remove this.\n\n148\n00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.228\nSo you turn on to\nthe remove area pencil and\n\n149\n00:07:14.228 --> 00:07:18.180\nyou can kinda say let's go ahead and\nremove this area.\n\n150\n00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:23.360\nOop and now it cut off some of his ear,\ndon't like that.\n\n151\n00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.821\nLet's go ahead and do that.\n\n152\n00:07:24.821 --> 00:07:27.633\nSo this is where you're gonna have\nto go back and forth a little bit.\n\n153\n00:07:27.633 --> 00:07:32.091\nBut then when you keep it,\nthis is the result you might get, and\n\n154\n00:07:32.091 --> 00:07:34.711\nthat's pretty jagged right there.\n\n155\n00:07:34.711 --> 00:07:35.780\n&gt;&gt; That's not nice.\n\n156\n00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.310\n&gt;&gt; No, that's where you were little,\n\n157\n00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.220\nyou cut out a little too much\ncoffee with that X-ACTO knife.\n\n158\n00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.920\n&gt;&gt; I was really cranky man and\nI was up late at night,\n\n159\n00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.504\nI had to get this done it as a project.\n\n160\n00:07:43.504 --> 00:07:45.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just like in school right,\n\n161\n00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:46.980\nyou had it due the next day.\n\n162\n00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:47.603\nYou know what I'm talking about.\n\n163\n00:07:47.603 --> 00:07:50.859\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like coffee, coffee,\ncoffee and then you get it all done and\n\n164\n00:07:50.859 --> 00:07:52.758\nsomehow you fall asleep in this class.\n\n165\n00:07:52.758 --> 00:07:53.945\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I did that.\n\n166\n00:07:53.945 --> 00:07:55.869\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n167\n00:07:55.869 --> 00:07:57.107\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n168\n00:07:57.107 --> 00:08:01.869\n&gt;&gt; Not the most perfect result sometimes.\n\n169\n00:08:01.869 --> 00:08:04.792\nYou gotta kinda take the good,\nyou take the bad, and there you have-\n\n170\n00:08:04.792 --> 00:08:06.114\n&gt;&gt; Take them both and there you have.\n\n171\n00:08:06.114 --> 00:08:06.745\n&gt;&gt; The facts of life.\n\n172\n00:08:06.745 --> 00:08:07.260\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n173\n00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:08.916\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; Go somewhere where else you know.\n\n174\n00:08:08.916 --> 00:08:10.808\nShould've listened to your\nown thing about copyright.\n\n175\n00:08:10.808 --> 00:08:11.586\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know, right?\n\n176\n00:08:11.586 --> 00:08:15.151\nCreative comments, right?\n\n177\n00:08:15.151 --> 00:08:19.151\nAll right, so back here, now we're gonna\nto get into all those different things we\n\n178\n00:08:19.151 --> 00:08:21.540\ncan do with formatting it with styles.\n\n179\n00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.353\nLet's have some fun.\n\n180\n00:08:23.353 --> 00:08:26.813\nWe will come over here to\nthis picture of Fuego, and\n\n181\n00:08:26.813 --> 00:08:30.040\nthis is the one that we\ndid use the crop on there.\n\n182\n00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.670\nSo we've got it cropped to a shape.\n\n183\n00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:35.205\nI would like to put on, sorry.\n\n184\n00:08:35.205 --> 00:08:37.680\n[LAUGH] We wanna put on a border,\n\n185\n00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.369\nI wanna put on an effect\nup here in the Format tab.\n\n186\n00:08:42.715 --> 00:08:43.866\nLots of different things you could do.\n\n187\n00:08:43.866 --> 00:08:47.460\nWhen they started adding all of these\nimage correction tools in here,\n\n188\n00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.460\nthis is another one where I was like,\ngood job Microsoft.\n\n189\n00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.290\nI don't have to go ahead and\ndo all this stuff in Photoshop any more.\n\n190\n00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:57.200\nI can do it right here within Office\nproduct, a lot of great things.\n\n191\n00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:02.855\nSo we're gonna start over here in\nthe Format, picture styles, border.\n\n192\n00:09:02.855 --> 00:09:07.589\nBorder around it, I want to add,\nlet's say a green border.\n\n193\n00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:09.840\nWell maybe I want the border\nto be a little bit thicker.\n\n194\n00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.430\nCome into here,\nyou can change the weight of the border.\n\n195\n00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:17.102\nMaybe I want it to be,\nmaybe four points, maybe six points,\n\n196\n00:09:17.102 --> 00:09:18.696\nmake it a little thicker.\n\n197\n00:09:18.696 --> 00:09:22.460\nYay, I can change the type of border.\n\n198\n00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:26.080\nI can make it dashed or dotted,\nmaybe a little bit of dots around there.\n\n199\n00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.279\nSo you could change the border.\n\n200\n00:09:28.279 --> 00:09:33.069\nNow, effects, I'm not gonna go over every\nsingle one of these in here because we\n\n201\n00:09:33.069 --> 00:09:34.489\nwould be here forever.\n\n202\n00:09:34.489 --> 00:09:35.255\n&gt;&gt; That would take awhile.\n\n203\n00:09:35.255 --> 00:09:37.288\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And the nice thing is it gives us\n\n204\n00:09:37.288 --> 00:09:38.056\npictures.\n\n205\n00:09:38.056 --> 00:09:42.615\nSo if I click on the shadow,\nnotice all of these options in here.\n\n206\n00:09:42.615 --> 00:09:48.790\nAnd if I hover over them, you can also see\nit happening on the photograph itself.\n\n207\n00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:51.170\nDo I want an inner shadow?\n\n208\n00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:54.140\nDo I want an external shadow?\n\n209\n00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.630\nAll of the different\nways that I can add this.\n\n210\n00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:58.302\nAnd if I scroll down a little bit more,\n\n211\n00:09:58.302 --> 00:10:00.617\nyou also have some ones\nthat have some perspective.\n\n212\n00:10:00.617 --> 00:10:02.110\nI love these.\n\n213\n00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:05.600\nSo think about how to try to\ndo this in other products,\n\n214\n00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.630\nit would take a long time and\nI love they had it all built into here.\n\n215\n00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:13.720\nSo, shadow, reflection,\nthat's another one that can be kinda fun.\n\n216\n00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:18.590\nIf I zoom out a little bit,\nIt's gonna reflect down on there, so\n\n217\n00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:21.190\nlet me try to zoom out just\na little bit so you can see it.\n\n218\n00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:24.894\nCome back over to the effects and\nthe reflection.\n\n219\n00:10:24.894 --> 00:10:26.934\nCute, very nice.\n\n220\n00:10:26.934 --> 00:10:31.170\nGlow, got the ideas here,\nwhere are these colors being picked from?\n\n221\n00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:32.230\nFrom your themes.\n\n222\n00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.190\nDo you want a lot of glow,\na little bit of glow?\n\n223\n00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:35.818\nDo you want another glow color?\n\n224\n00:10:35.818 --> 00:10:39.972\nLet's make a glow in pink cuz\nthat's what we gotta go with.\n\n225\n00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:42.819\n[LAUGH] We will choose this larger one.\n\n226\n00:10:42.819 --> 00:10:43.586\nWell now it's orange.\n\n227\n00:10:43.586 --> 00:10:44.625\nOkay, we'll keep it orange.\n\n228\n00:10:44.625 --> 00:10:46.701\n[LAUGH] You get the idea.\n\n229\n00:10:46.701 --> 00:10:48.502\nSoft Edges, the Beveling,\n\n230\n00:10:48.502 --> 00:10:52.789\nall these different features that\nyou can put on your photographs.\n\n231\n00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.853\nAnd you could have a lot of fun with\nthese different options, all right.\n\n232\n00:10:57.853 --> 00:11:01.376\nNow, what if I went ahead and\nstarted this, and was like, hm,\n\n233\n00:11:01.376 --> 00:11:03.850\nI don't know if I like this too much,\nokay?\n\n234\n00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:08.040\nAnd I've done so much I can't undo or\nmaybe I've come back tomorrow, I was like,\n\n235\n00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.540\nI need to just kinda stop.\n\n236\n00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.200\nI've gussied too much.\n\n237\n00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.720\n&gt;&gt; Quit with the gussying, right?\n\n238\n00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.892\nThere's only so much gussying\none Excel spreadsheet can do.\n\n239\n00:11:15.892 --> 00:11:18.912\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So we have the reset, okay?\n\n240\n00:11:18.912 --> 00:11:22.384\nLet's go ahead and\njust take a pause, let's reset here.\n\n241\n00:11:22.384 --> 00:11:26.750\nOver here on the right hand, other right,\nthe left, we have the reset picture.\n\n242\n00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:30.020\nNotice there is a drop-down cuz\nthere's two options, reset picture,\n\n243\n00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.550\nor reset picture and size.\n\n244\n00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:35.550\nCuz remember, it was a little bit\nbigger and then we made it smaller.\n\n245\n00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:40.680\nSo if I choose reset picture,\nit also takes the cropping that I did,\n\n246\n00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:45.002\nbut it keeps it to the size\nthat I had made the photograph.\n\n247\n00:11:45.002 --> 00:11:47.582\nIf I go to the reset picture and size,\n\n248\n00:11:47.582 --> 00:11:52.750\nthis was the original size that it\nwas when I put it into the worksheet.\n\n249\n00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:57.260\nSo that's the difference between\nthe two resets in there.\n\n250\n00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.092\nAnd I just, I, looks like I\nkinda squashed him a little bit.\n\n251\n00:12:00.092 --> 00:12:03.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There we go, okay, no why?\n\n252\n00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:03.970\nOkay, you know what?\n\n253\n00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:05.815\nI think it's just his face.\n\n254\n00:12:05.815 --> 00:12:08.190\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's just his little face.\n\n255\n00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:09.540\nSo now I have the reset.\n\n256\n00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.730\nAnd these buttons right here,\nthese are all styles.\n\n257\n00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:15.291\nWhat's a style?\n\n258\n00:12:15.291 --> 00:12:17.170\nIt's a named group of formatting.\n\n259\n00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:21.740\nSo if I wanted to drop these down, maybe\nI wanted it to have a little rotation,\n\n260\n00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.910\na little curled edges, little drop shadow,\nthis is one of my favorites by the way,\n\n261\n00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:26.660\nit's my favorite preset.\n\n262\n00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:31.450\nOr if I wanted a darker border, so\nyou can choose a preset on any of these.\n\n263\n00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:35.440\nAnd some of these have those 3D\nwhere it's kind of like laying down.\n\n264\n00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.386\nSo I can choose that and\n\n265\n00:12:36.386 --> 00:12:40.800\nbe like, I love that one, but now I\nwanna change the color of the border.\n\n266\n00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:45.700\nYou can come over here and choose,\nlet's say an orange or a red, and so\n\n267\n00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:46.500\non and so forth.\n\n268\n00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:47.170\n&gt;&gt; It's gotta go red.\n\n269\n00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:48.321\nIt's Fuego.\nHe's on fire.\n\n270\n00:12:48.321 --> 00:12:52.370\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, he is Mr. Fire Pants, so.\n\n271\n00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:53.748\nAnd it matches with the Christmas theme,\nso.\n\n272\n00:12:53.748 --> 00:12:55.120\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n273\n00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.316\n&gt;&gt; So you can start with the preset and\nthen change from there, and\n\n274\n00:12:58.316 --> 00:13:00.920\nthen add on more effects,\nand so on, and so forth.\n\n275\n00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:05.129\nLet's go ahead and reset that picture,\nand let's reset the, nope we don't need\n\n276\n00:13:05.129 --> 00:13:08.740\nto reset the size, I don't know why\nI just clicked that, sorry guys.\n\n277\n00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.170\nWe'll move that over here.\n\n278\n00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:13.670\nOkay, that actually looks\na little bit better.\n\n279\n00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:19.530\nMoving on to some other things that we\ncan do with changing our photographs.\n\n280\n00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:22.117\nAnd this is probably an area,\nDaniel, that you use,\n\n281\n00:13:22.117 --> 00:13:24.373\ncuz I know you do a lot of photography,\nright?\n\n282\n00:13:24.373 --> 00:13:25.090\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n283\n00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:26.860\nyou do some color corrections-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n284\n00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:28.010\n&gt;&gt; And things like that?\n\n285\n00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:32.040\nSo the same thing you can do here in,\nI almost said Photoshop.\n\n286\n00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:32.590\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n287\n00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:33.415\n&gt;&gt; It's not Photoshop,\n\n288\n00:13:33.415 --> 00:13:36.235\nthis is Excel.\nWe can come into corrections,\n\n289\n00:13:36.235 --> 00:13:40.320\nchanging the brightness and contrast.\nNow that's a little blown out.\n\n290\n00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.208\n&gt;&gt; A little blown out,\n\n291\n00:13:41.208 --> 00:13:43.935\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; But we can kinda go back and forth, and\n\n292\n00:13:43.935 --> 00:13:45.050\nthat's a little too dark.\n\n293\n00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:49.330\nBut if you had a photograph that started\nlike this, you could go ahead and\n\n294\n00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.150\nbrighten that up a little bit to-\n&gt;&gt; Kinda\n\n295\n00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:52.435\nbring up the exposure a little bit.\n\n296\n00:13:52.435 --> 00:13:54.540\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; See?\n\n297\n00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:58.720\n&gt;&gt; So we have the corrections,\nthen we also have the coloring.\n\n298\n00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.710\nSo this is where if I wanted to\nmaybe make it black and white, or\n\n299\n00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:07.370\nI wanted to put a little\nblue overlay on this.\n\n300\n00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:11.070\nSo we can go ahead and\nchange that, lots of fun there.\n\n301\n00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:15.110\nAnd I think you kinda get the idea\nfrom the samples, if I keep,\n\n302\n00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:19.015\nthat's like keeping the darks, and\nthen whoops that's the wrong button.\n\n303\n00:14:19.015 --> 00:14:22.630\n[LAUGH] And then,\nthis one is where it's keeping the lights.\n\n304\n00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:26.714\nIt's like where it's actually doing, well\nthey're both keeping the darks and lights,\n\n305\n00:14:26.714 --> 00:14:28.657\nbut that's where the color is happening.\n\n306\n00:14:28.657 --> 00:14:30.954\nOkay, so we have-\n&gt;&gt; It's like a sepia.\n\n307\n00:14:30.954 --> 00:14:32.890\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n308\n00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:35.273\nSo we have the different\ntoning that we could do.\n\n309\n00:14:35.273 --> 00:14:38.500\nAnd then lastly, we can come\ndown into this artistic effects.\n\n310\n00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:43.450\nNow I'm gonna reset this,\njust the picture before we go on to these.\n\n311\n00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:46.270\nThese are like filters in Photoshop,\nright?\n\n312\n00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:47.205\nDo you remember remember this one?\n\n313\n00:14:47.205 --> 00:14:47.715\nHave you seen?\n\n314\n00:14:47.715 --> 00:14:48.695\nYou've seen this one.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n315\n00:14:48.695 --> 00:14:49.655\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yes.\n\n316\n00:14:49.655 --> 00:14:50.575\n&gt;&gt; Super fun one.\n\n317\n00:14:50.575 --> 00:14:51.710\nEveryone uses this one.\n\n318\n00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:53.315\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, I've seen that.\n\n319\n00:14:53.315 --> 00:14:54.075\n&gt;&gt; It's kinda played out.\n\n320\n00:14:54.075 --> 00:14:55.812\nIt's like lambo doors or\nsomething, it's horrible.\n\n321\n00:14:55.812 --> 00:14:57.855\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n322\n00:14:57.855 --> 00:15:00.375\nSo we have these different\nones that we can do,\n\n323\n00:15:00.375 --> 00:15:04.345\nand then we can change the different\nartistic effects and so\n\n324\n00:15:04.345 --> 00:15:10.090\nyou can see all of these are just\nstraight-out like filters from Photoshop.\n\n325\n00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:13.520\nBut you can change some of\nthese options to here, so.\n\n326\n00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:16.051\nThis is almost like those\nfilters that you have in\n\n327\n00:15:16.051 --> 00:15:17.000\nInstagram-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n328\n00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.030\n&gt;&gt; And everything.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, very similar.\n\n329\n00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:18.600\nAll of this stuff.\n\n330\n00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:23.785\nSo it all comes from the same sources of\njust changing the different levels and\n\n331\n00:15:23.785 --> 00:15:26.593\nthings on retouching your photographs.\n\n332\n00:15:26.593 --> 00:15:29.406\n&gt;&gt; Well, I mean that's good on Microsoft's\npart because obviously those are popular,\n\n333\n00:15:29.406 --> 00:15:31.350\nthat's why they're in\nthose other programs.\n\n334\n00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:34.369\nSo they want to make sure all the popular\nthings are inside of their program,\n\n335\n00:15:34.369 --> 00:15:35.278\nmake you wanna use it.\n\n336\n00:15:35.278 --> 00:15:36.415\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n337\n00:15:36.415 --> 00:15:37.002\n&gt;&gt; Well said.\n\n338\n00:15:37.002 --> 00:15:37.913\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Sounds like you\n\n339\n00:15:37.913 --> 00:15:38.653\nwork for Microsoft.\n\n340\n00:15:38.653 --> 00:15:41.035\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] This was not\nendorsed by Microsoft.\n\n341\n00:15:41.035 --> 00:15:42.825\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n342\n00:15:42.825 --> 00:15:44.055\nSo that will reset this.\n\n343\n00:15:44.055 --> 00:15:48.668\nSo lots of different things that\nyou can do for changing and\n\n344\n00:15:48.668 --> 00:15:52.921\naltering your images in all\nof your Office products.\n\n345\n00:15:52.921 --> 00:15:56.547\nSo, every one of these things that\nwe're doing, we've been doing,\n\n346\n00:15:56.547 --> 00:16:00.786\nthe little drop-downs, and the buttons,\nand the presets, and that's great,\n\n347\n00:16:00.786 --> 00:16:02.032\ncuz it's a lot easier.\n\n348\n00:16:02.032 --> 00:16:04.591\nCuz there's a lot of things\nthat you can tweak and\n\n349\n00:16:04.591 --> 00:16:07.070\njust move those levels up and down.\n\n350\n00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:10.180\nBut if you ever wanted to have\na little bit more of that fine tuning,\n\n351\n00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:14.950\nmaybe I wanted even more of\na glow than it gave me or\n\n352\n00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:21.100\na deeper drop shadow,\nyou can come into any of these options.\n\n353\n00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.440\nThere will be, for example,\n\n354\n00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:26.060\nif I go into here, it always goes\nback into picture color options.\n\n355\n00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:30.280\nOr if I go into corrections,\npicture corrections options.\n\n356\n00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:36.441\nOr, if I right click on these selected\nphotograph, there is Format Picture.\n\n357\n00:16:36.441 --> 00:16:39.850\nWhichever way it's gonna\nget you to the same place.\n\n358\n00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:43.650\nIf I click on this it's gonna\nbring over on the right hand side\n\n359\n00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:46.500\nthe Format Picture task pane.\n\n360\n00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:52.270\nAnd as you can see over here, we've got\nsome different buttons like Fill in Line,\n\n361\n00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:57.040\nthe Effects, the Size and\nProperties and the Picture.\n\n362\n00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:01.690\nSo right in there, there's my glow\ncuz I'm right now on the effects.\n\n363\n00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:06.220\nIf I expand out the glow,\nhere are the presets that I can choose.\n\n364\n00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:10.640\nSo let's just choose a blue for\nnow, but then there's the size.\n\n365\n00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:14.821\nSee, I could go ahead and\nmake that a bigger glow or\n\n366\n00:17:14.821 --> 00:17:21.009\nchange the transparency or come into\nthe shadow and add a shadow and then.\n\n367\n00:17:21.009 --> 00:17:24.870\nWell, shadows and\nglows together don't always mesh well.\n\n368\n00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:27.488\nBut, I think you get the idea that every\nsingle thing, look at all these things.\n\n369\n00:17:27.488 --> 00:17:30.575\nYou can change the blur,\nangle, distance, the glow.\n\n370\n00:17:30.575 --> 00:17:35.451\nIf I come into the 3D format and\ndrop this down you've got every\n\n371\n00:17:35.451 --> 00:17:40.511\nsingle type of lever and button that\nyou can go back and forth on and\n\n372\n00:17:40.511 --> 00:17:45.680\nget that exact desired effect that\nyou want where you need it to be.\n\n373\n00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:49.750\nSo lots and lots of options that are in\n\n374\n00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:54.090\nthis Format Picture task pane\nthat you can be able to access.\n\n375\n00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:59.050\nSo if all of these buttons up here\nweren't enough for you you can go and\n\n376\n00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:03.920\ntweak until your heart's content\nover here in the task pane.\n\n377\n00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:05.570\nLet me reset that one more time.\n\n378\n00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:10.394\nBut the other reason why I wanted to come\nover into the Format Picture task pane,\n\n379\n00:18:10.394 --> 00:18:14.572\nwas to talk about alternative text,\nor otherwise known as alt text.\n\n380\n00:18:14.572 --> 00:18:18.584\nThis is something that is important any\ntime that you add graphical elements into\n\n381\n00:18:18.584 --> 00:18:20.066\nany of your Office products.\n\n382\n00:18:20.066 --> 00:18:21.570\n&gt;&gt; Is it a 90s music style?\n\n383\n00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:23.954\n[LAUGH] Alt text nation.\n\n384\n00:18:23.954 --> 00:18:26.490\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're speaking to my\n\n385\n00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:27.540\ngeneration for sure.\n\n386\n00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:30.320\nI know you and I are on that same page.\n\n387\n00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:34.470\nBut this is actually where we're\ngetting into different ways for\n\n388\n00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:37.280\naccessibility, which is\na very important thing\n\n389\n00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:41.130\nto be aware of when doing\nanything within your documents.\n\n390\n00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:43.550\nThis could be in Office or\nany other products.\n\n391\n00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:48.540\nSo accessibility would be things like can,\nwe can see this image.\n\n392\n00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:51.780\nI see a cat in a funny hat\nnext to a Christmas tree.\n\n393\n00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:54.510\nBecause we have the gift of sight.\n\n394\n00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:56.490\nBut what if somebody is non-sighted?\n\n395\n00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:58.850\nThey can't see the image.\n\n396\n00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:03.930\nBut with technology, they have different\nscreen readers and software and\n\n397\n00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:10.870\nhardware that will allow it to speak\nwhat is being shown on the computer.\n\n398\n00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:15.540\nAnd so, you being able to describe,\n\n399\n00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:20.030\ngiving some type of\ndescription as to what this is,\n\n400\n00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:23.660\na white cat in a Christmas\nhat at Christmas time.\n\n401\n00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:24.770\nSo you write the description out.\n\n402\n00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:26.998\nAnd that software will come and read that.\n\n403\n00:19:26.998 --> 00:19:31.031\nSo then that person can visualize or\nsee the image.\n\n404\n00:19:31.031 --> 00:19:33.620\nSo it's really important to have and\nall of that.\n\n405\n00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:37.290\nHaving your documents\nto be ADA compliant or\n\n406\n00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:41.840\nAmerican Disabilities Act, being able to\nhave it accessible, is really important.\n\n407\n00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.930\nNow when we get into\nthe document properties,\n\n408\n00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:48.160\nthere is an accessibility checker\nwhere it will go ahead and\n\n409\n00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:51.030\ntell you hey, this isn't right,\nthat isn't right.\n\n410\n00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:53.915\nBut one of the biggest things you can do\n\n411\n00:19:53.915 --> 00:19:57.075\nwith your graphical elements\nis add that alternate text.\n\n412\n00:19:57.075 --> 00:19:59.025\nOkay, so let me show you how to do it.\n\n413\n00:19:59.025 --> 00:20:03.915\nAnd I do have in my show notes a couple\nwebsites that I do have pulled up as well\n\n414\n00:20:03.915 --> 00:20:04.695\nof how to do it.\n\n415\n00:20:04.695 --> 00:20:09.765\nAnd you can see right there, add alt text\nto a chart, picture, SmartArt, shape.\n\n416\n00:20:09.765 --> 00:20:13.555\nThis is any graphical element\nwill have this same thing.\n\n417\n00:20:13.555 --> 00:20:17.580\nWe know where this\nFormat Picture task pane is.\n\n418\n00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:20.076\nAnd we know that we can go\ninto the size and properties.\n\n419\n00:20:20.076 --> 00:20:25.060\nAnd then we go ahead and\nadd a description and or a title.\n\n420\n00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:29.740\nNow this is one where I was always taught,\nback in the day,\n\n421\n00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:32.390\nnow this is a long time ago,\nto go ahead and put in the title.\n\n422\n00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:33.453\nCuz the title was what would be read.\n\n423\n00:20:33.453 --> 00:20:37.468\nAnd then the description was if\nyou wanted to have a longer,\n\n424\n00:20:37.468 --> 00:20:41.740\na more detailed description,\nyou go ahead and put that there.\n\n425\n00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:47.330\nWell, I read in this blog post right here,\nthat I thought was really interesting.\n\n426\n00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:49.440\nI was really impressed with this one.\n\n427\n00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:54.479\nSo this is, by the way,\nthis is Terrill Thompson's blog.\n\n428\n00:20:54.479 --> 00:20:57.060\nSo I have in the show notes,\nso definitely check that out.\n\n429\n00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:57.881\nAnd don't worry about the date.\n\n430\n00:20:57.881 --> 00:21:01.600\nThat's from 2014, but\nit's still very pertinent.\n\n431\n00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.688\nBut I liked how it was talking about\nwhy you would want to use this.\n\n432\n00:21:04.688 --> 00:21:06.293\nAnd it does date back or\n\n433\n00:21:06.293 --> 00:21:12.380\ncome from HTML days of being able to\nput that alternate text on your images.\n\n434\n00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:17.460\nBut let me just scroll down to give\nyou the conclusion which I like.\n\n435\n00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:23.060\nIf you just want to remember one thing,\nuse description not title.\n\n436\n00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:25.786\nThat was actually something for.\n\n437\n00:21:25.786 --> 00:21:26.570\nReally?\n\n438\n00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:27.480\nI had it reversed.\n\n439\n00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.790\nI thought it was always use the title and\nnot description.\n\n440\n00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:31.620\nBut it's going through all of this.\n\n441\n00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:37.090\nSo, like I said definitely read this about\nhow each one of even the software how it\n\n442\n00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:42.130\nrenders it and what it picks out of what\nit suppose to say for people with those,\n\n443\n00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:46.130\nfor non-sighted or anybody with visual\nimpairment to be able to go through it.\n\n444\n00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:48.100\nSo check it out, pretty cool.\n\n445\n00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:52.740\nBut it's nice that it's saying go ahead\nand use the description over the title.\n\n446\n00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:54.780\nOr really, just go ahead and use both.\n\n447\n00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.660\nI do think there is a size limitation.\n\n448\n00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:59.323\nThe title,\nI wanna say it's only 128 characters.\n\n449\n00:21:59.323 --> 00:22:03.990\nAnd then the description is\nmore than that, 255 possibly.\n\n450\n00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:07.400\nOr maybe it's 255 and\nthen the other one's a lot longer.\n\n451\n00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.220\nRegardless, we know that we\ncan go ahead and do that.\n\n452\n00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.330\nSo I've come back down into Excel.\n\n453\n00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:14.640\nI have Fuego's picture selected.\n\n454\n00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:18.370\nOver here on the Format Picture toolbar,\ntask pane, sorry.\n\n455\n00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:20.020\nIf I come over here, there's that.\n\n456\n00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:21.300\nNope, not techbox.\n\n457\n00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.000\nThere's alternate text, there it is.\n\n458\n00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.673\nAnd now you can see that I have title,\ndescription.\n\n459\n00:22:25.673 --> 00:22:28.800\nAnd we can say, a big,\n\n460\n00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:33.417\nwhite cat with a, whoo, hello.\n\n461\n00:22:33.417 --> 00:22:34.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, let's make sure.\n\n462\n00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:40.027\nWith a top hat on its head.\n\n463\n00:22:40.027 --> 00:22:42.170\n&gt;&gt; Ints head.\n\n464\n00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:43.720\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, here.\n\n465\n00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:47.468\nPlease don't watch what I,\njust listen to what I say not what I do.\n\n466\n00:22:47.468 --> 00:22:49.750\n[LAUGH] And so on and so forth.\n\n467\n00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:52.460\nI can say at Christmastime and\nso on and so forth.\n\n468\n00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:55.460\nCool thing is in your Word and\n\n469\n00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:59.610\nPowerPoint, they've gone on into this\nnew kind of intelligent services where\n\n470\n00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:03.370\nit automatically adds\nalt text to your images.\n\n471\n00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:05.000\nIt is really, really cool.\n\n472\n00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.010\n&gt;&gt; That's kinda awesome.\n\n473\n00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:07.503\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now it's not in Excel though.\n\n474\n00:23:07.503 --> 00:23:12.410\nSo it's only going to be in Word and\nPowerPoint right now.\n\n475\n00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:13.470\nWith all of these updates,\n\n476\n00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:17.070\nand how they start kind of rolling it out,\nmaybe one day down the line.\n\n477\n00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:19.081\nAnd maybe at the time you're\nwatching this recording,\n\n478\n00:23:19.081 --> 00:23:20.595\nyou're like well I have alternate text.\n\n479\n00:23:20.595 --> 00:23:22.160\nIt just come right up the bottom.\n\n480\n00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.332\nThey might extend that into Excel.\n\n481\n00:23:23.332 --> 00:23:26.839\nBut again, we've talked about this before.\n\n482\n00:23:26.839 --> 00:23:28.799\nHow many times are you gonna\nuse pictures in Excel?\n\n483\n00:23:28.799 --> 00:23:31.884\nIt depends, at least you know\nthat these are the options.\n\n484\n00:23:31.884 --> 00:23:36.682\nBut Word, and especially PowerPoint,\nthat's where you're gonna probably have\n\n485\n00:23:36.682 --> 00:23:39.290\nthe most use-\n&gt;&gt; Use out of this, yeah.\n\n486\n00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:40.610\n&gt;&gt; For images there.\n\n487\n00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:45.401\nBut I definitely wanted to go ahead and\ntackle the alternate text for you,\n\n488\n00:23:45.401 --> 00:23:48.735\ncuz it is a very important\naspect of adding images.\n\n489\n00:23:48.735 --> 00:23:53.810\nSo, the only thing that I haven't covered,\nsince I know we're getting close to edge,\n\n490\n00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:57.396\nwe're gonna do the change picture and\nthe compress picture.\n\n491\n00:23:57.396 --> 00:24:01.361\nSo if I have this photograph and lets\ngo back in especially to like the crop\n\n492\n00:24:01.361 --> 00:24:05.716\nto shape and when we went back to having\nhim in his little heart and lets throw on,\n\n493\n00:24:05.716 --> 00:24:08.090\noop that is another thing, sorry.\n\n494\n00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:09.600\nNotice how I put the crop on and\n\n495\n00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:11.896\nthen I put this preset on-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n496\n00:24:11.896 --> 00:24:14.800\n&gt;&gt; But I was like I want to go ahead and\nmake it like this.\n\n497\n00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:20.630\nIf you do it the crop first it always take\ns it off get all the stuff you want and\n\n498\n00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:24.570\nthen do the crop because\nthat way it keeps.\n\n499\n00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:27.790\nIt's not that it can't do it,\nyou just have to do it in succession.\n\n500\n00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:29.660\nSo I have all of this.\n\n501\n00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:34.530\nI love all of the cropping and the recess\nbut I don't like the photo anymore.\n\n502\n00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:39.550\nI want to put in Bishop because he's\nfeeling a little left out over here,\n\n503\n00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:43.630\nchange the picture, we'll go ahead and\nmodify the photograph,\n\n504\n00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:46.560\nbut keep all of the formatting in there.\n\n505\n00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:50.640\nAnd I would like to change it from file,\nbecause I have a picture.\n\n506\n00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:56.020\nAnd maybe I'd like to choose, now do keep\nin mind that the aspect ratio in a sense\n\n507\n00:24:56.020 --> 00:25:00.430\nthat I have, it's like the landscape\nversus portrait, Fuego's picture\n\n508\n00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:05.390\nis very much in a landscape mentality,\n\n509\n00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:09.720\nif you want to say, and\nBishop is in more of a portrait, so\n\n510\n00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:15.410\nit will change how the photograph\nkind of moves within the crop.\n\n511\n00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:17.640\nLet me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n512\n00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:22.040\nSo if I go over here to this one and\nthen click on insert.\n\n513\n00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:25.940\nYou see how it changed it because it\nsought this then it goes to this.\n\n514\n00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:29.760\nAnd so it kind of squashes it,\nso that will happen.\n\n515\n00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:33.740\nYou can always extend this out, but\nnow you're kind of stretching bishop out.\n\n516\n00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:39.550\nSo just know trying to keep the same\nportrait versus landscape and\n\n517\n00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:42.360\nwhat picture you're using to\nchange up the picture but\n\n518\n00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:45.510\nit did keep all the formating\nof the photograph in there.\n\n519\n00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:51.231\nI'm gonna undo a few more times,\nwe'll go with there.\n\n520\n00:25:51.231 --> 00:25:54.240\nNow the picture that I started\nwith Fuego was pretty big.\n\n521\n00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.160\nActually this one would\nprobably be the best one.\n\n522\n00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:58.765\nThis was a- [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I cut him out over there-\n\n523\n00:25:58.765 --> 00:26:00.050\n&gt;&gt; Jungle cats-\n\n524\n00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:01.400\n&gt;&gt; Look at what we can do I\n\n525\n00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.507\nforgot that we can reset, yeah.\n\n526\n00:26:03.507 --> 00:26:07.590\nIt was a really big picture I\nmade it really, really small.\n\n527\n00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:11.170\nCompressing a picture,\nthis is where we mentioned before I\n\n528\n00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:13.680\nthink in the last episode\nwe talked about resampling.\n\n529\n00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.490\nResampling is changing\nthe amount of pixels.\n\n530\n00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:19.595\nCuz it still thinks that\nit has the 3,000 by 4,000.\n\n531\n00:26:19.595 --> 00:26:23.580\nI just kind of squashed them all down,\nso it still has all that information.\n\n532\n00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:27.160\nThat's a large file, and\nif I have a whole bunch of things,\n\n533\n00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:31.674\ncompressing it means that it's going\nto just reduce the size of the image to\n\n534\n00:26:31.674 --> 00:26:36.170\nmake it to where your file will go\nahead and perform a little bit better.\n\n535\n00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:41.670\nCuz if I have a bunch of these images It's\ngonna make my file size a lot larger,\n\n536\n00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:46.430\nespecially in the nowadays when you\nhave size limitations on your emails or\n\n537\n00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:47.980\nyour mailboxes and things like that.\n\n538\n00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:49.600\nIt's something to know about.\n\n539\n00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:50.980\nSo if I select a photo draft and\n\n540\n00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:56.010\ngo to Compress Pictures it's going to\nask me right here a couple questions.\n\n541\n00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:59.146\nDo you first want to apply\nthis to only this picture,\n\n542\n00:26:59.146 --> 00:27:02.087\nif you uncheck that it\nmeans it's gonna do what?\n\n543\n00:27:02.087 --> 00:27:06.387\nFor all the pictures, so that's a nice\nway to say, let's just go ahead and\n\n544\n00:27:06.387 --> 00:27:10.278\nmake sure all the pictures are optimized,\nas they call it that way,\n\n545\n00:27:10.278 --> 00:27:12.620\nto the smallest size that it needs to be.\n\n546\n00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:16.600\nAnd, delete the information\nthat is cropped.\n\n547\n00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.610\nWhen we talked about cropping doesn't\nremove any of the information,\n\n548\n00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:20.970\nit just hides it.\n\n549\n00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:22.980\nSo that's something you\nmight want to check out.\n\n550\n00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:24.370\nAnd then the other one's right here.\n\n551\n00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:29.648\nDo you want to go ahead and\nmake the resolution web or email?\n\n552\n00:27:29.648 --> 00:27:35.329\nWeb, that 150 ppi, that's going to\nbe kind of a nice middle ground,\n\n553\n00:27:35.329 --> 00:27:37.390\nit'll still print okay.\n\n554\n00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:40.590\nNow when I say print I'm talking\nabout on your desktop printers,\n\n555\n00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:44.510\nnot your commercial printers where you're\nsending this off to a service provider.\n\n556\n00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:47.239\nBut that's where we can choose,\nI'll choose web and\n\n557\n00:27:47.239 --> 00:27:48.884\nI'll say that's really good.\n\n558\n00:27:48.884 --> 00:27:53.854\nAnd then I will click okay, and now you're\nnot gonna get any visual differences here,\n\n559\n00:27:53.854 --> 00:27:56.980\nbut the file size is gonna\nbe a lot more manageable.\n\n560\n00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:59.280\nSo some different things to know about,\nit's really simple,\n\n561\n00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:01.760\nit's really more of like\na concept to understand.\n\n562\n00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:05.650\nIt's not changing everything, but your\nfile size will be smaller so you've got\n\n563\n00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:11.750\na lot of images, do that compress and\nyou will make it a lot more manageable.\n\n564\n00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:14.640\n&gt;&gt; All right well Vonn we've\ncovered a lot of cool formating\n\n565\n00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:18.820\nthat we can work with within images\ninside of Excel, so if you are so incline\n\n566\n00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:22.950\nto add images you can actually play around\nwith them and make them look, pretty cool.\n\n567\n00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:25.400\nWe do thank you, Vaughan, for\nshowing us how we can do that.\n\n568\n00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:29.510\nBut guess what, we're out of time for this\nepisode so we're gonna have to sign off.\n\n569\n00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:31.680\nFor Office Pro TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n570\n00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:32.380\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vaughan Smith.\n\n571\n00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:33.593\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n572\n00:28:33.593 --> 00:28:39.108\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

I'm doing wonderful today.\n\n11\n00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:31.161\nWe are going to be talking\nabout shapes in this episode.\n\n12\n00:00:31.161 --> 00:00:32.325\nHow to, yes, shapes.\n\n13\n00:00:32.325 --> 00:00:34.176\n&gt;&gt; Spheres and circles.\n\n14\n00:00:34.176 --> 00:00:34.684\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n15\n00:00:34.684 --> 00:00:35.435\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n16\n00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:35.935\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing this.\n\n17\n00:00:35.935 --> 00:00:36.623\n&gt;&gt; You're doing that.\n\n18\n00:00:36.623 --> 00:00:37.563\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying to do a heart,\n\n19\n00:00:37.563 --> 00:00:38.173\nit's like-\n&gt;&gt; That's\n\n20\n00:00:38.173 --> 00:00:39.061\nan amorphous blob.\n[LAUGH]\n\n21\n00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:39.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Circle so,\n\n22\n00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.185\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n23\n00:00:40.185 --> 00:00:43.589\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so we're gonna be showing\n\n24\n00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:48.287\nhow to add shapes into our Excel document.\nIt's not a document,\n\n25\n00:00:48.287 --> 00:00:51.335\nit's a spreadsheet.\nAnd then we're going to do some basic\n\n26\n00:00:51.335 --> 00:00:52.525\nformatting.\nSo\n\n27\n00:00:52.525 --> 00:00:56.830\nI've broken this up into two\nepisodes to cover everything.\n\n28\n00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.310\nAgain, just like we had talked\nabout in the images episode,\n\n29\n00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.150\nadding graphical elements into Excel.\n\n30\n00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.261\nEverybody needs a reason why to do it.\n\n31\n00:01:05.261 --> 00:01:06.578\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And sometimes you have it,\n\n32\n00:01:06.578 --> 00:01:10.060\nsometimes you don't, but\nit's always good to know that they exist.\n\n33\n00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.744\nBecause maybe you have an Excel\nspreadsheet and you wanna put a big arrow\n\n34\n00:01:13.744 --> 00:01:17.133\nto your sales cuz they're really\ngreat this month or something.\n\n35\n00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:20.698\nSo you could draw a shape and\npoint to it, make it bright pink and\n\n36\n00:01:20.698 --> 00:01:22.870\nglowing and all that kinda fun stuff.\n\n37\n00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.145\n&gt;&gt; That would draw my eye.\n\n38\n00:01:24.145 --> 00:01:26.523\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right?\n&gt;&gt; Away from the spreadsheet [LAUGH].\n\n39\n00:01:26.523 --> 00:01:30.468\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] I would be like, it's so\npretty, and not even look at the numbers.\n\n40\n00:01:30.468 --> 00:01:33.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH] There's\nnumbers on this spreadsheet?\n\n41\n00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, it's like,\nI'm like, it's just got pink, yeah!\n\n42\n00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.250\n&gt;&gt; That's all Vonne cares\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so let me go ahead and\n\n43\n00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.160\nshow you how to start this.\n\n44\n00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.390\nAnd this is the same on all\nof your Office products.\n\n45\n00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.719\nSo if you learn it in Excel and want to\ntranslate this over into PowerPoint or\n\n46\n00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:53.343\ninto Word, or if you've already done this\nin Word then it's the same in Excel.\n\n47\n00:01:53.343 --> 00:01:53.855\n&gt;&gt; Easy transition.\n\n48\n00:01:53.855 --> 00:01:57.714\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so I'm not saying stop watching,\nbut we're gonna go ahead and\n\n49\n00:01:57.714 --> 00:01:58.601\njump right in.\n\n50\n00:01:58.601 --> 00:02:01.040\nI have a graphics file open right now.\n\n51\n00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.310\nAnd this Insert Images,\nit's just a blank worksheet.\n\n52\n00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.090\nAnd I have it zoomed out a little bit so\nI can kinda draw a little bit bigger for\n\n53\n00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.040\nyou guys so you can see everything.\n\n54\n00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.570\nSo let's go over into our Insert tab,\nand we're gonna go to Illustrations.\n\n55\n00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.341\nWe learned about how to do our pictures,\n\n56\n00:02:19.341 --> 00:02:22.360\nour images that are made up of pixels,\nright.\n\n57\n00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.360\nAnd now we're getting into\nshapes which could be,\n\n58\n00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.228\nwe could say that they're\nvector information.\n\n59\n00:02:28.228 --> 00:02:31.331\nI'm not sure if it's true\nvector information, like,\n\n60\n00:02:31.331 --> 00:02:32.960\nwhat are you talking about?\n\n61\n00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.684\nIn the world of graphics you have\neither a pixel-based graphic,\n\n62\n00:02:36.684 --> 00:02:39.900\nwhich would be photographs,\nthings like that.\n\n63\n00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.900\nAnd then you have vector information.\n\n64\n00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.567\nWith vector, you don't have any pixels.\n\n65\n00:02:43.567 --> 00:02:45.199\n&gt;&gt; What is a raster graphic?\n\n66\n00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:49.776\n&gt;&gt; A raster is the same as a, yeah,\nraster is a graphic made up of pixels.\n\n67\n00:02:49.776 --> 00:02:50.500\n&gt;&gt; Well, there you go.\n\n68\n00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.118\n&gt;&gt; You can also be referring\nto it as a bitmap image.\n\n69\n00:02:53.118 --> 00:02:54.245\n&gt;&gt; I've heard of that as well.\n\n70\n00:02:54.245 --> 00:02:57.252\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a map of bits of information,\nwhich are pixels.\n\n71\n00:02:57.252 --> 00:02:58.470\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n72\n00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.091\n&gt;&gt; And that's what people are very\nfamiliar with because of our phones.\n\n73\n00:03:02.091 --> 00:03:04.412\nWe can take pictures and\nall that kinda stuff.\n\n74\n00:03:04.412 --> 00:03:07.661\nWhen you have vector information,\nthere are no pixels.\n\n75\n00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:13.730\nWhat you have are paths, and\nthose paths consist of fills and strokes.\n\n76\n00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.680\nThe strokes are the outline.\n\n77\n00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.332\nNow that's when you're working in a true\nvector product such as Adobe Illustrator.\n\n78\n00:03:21.332 --> 00:03:27.460\nAnd Adobe Photoshop would be to edit\nraster graphics, your pixel-based images.\n\n79\n00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.240\nIllustrator is used to create and\nedit vector graphics.\n\n80\n00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.330\nSo that's where you have all\nof the paths and everything.\n\n81\n00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.100\nAnd the cool thing about vector\ngraphics is that they are scalable.\n\n82\n00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.880\nYou can make it as big or\nas small as you want.\n\n83\n00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.610\nWe've talked about that\nin the images episode.\n\n84\n00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.190\nYou make an image bigger, and\nif it doesn't have enough pixels,\n\n85\n00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.140\nit looks all blurry.\n\n86\n00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.810\n&gt;&gt; But because a vector is just a point\nfrom one to the other, you can increase or\n\n87\n00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.570\ndecrease that point, and\nit just stays the same.\n\n88\n00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:52.110\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n89\n00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.015\n&gt;&gt; It's just all a bunch of math.\n\n90\n00:03:53.015 --> 00:03:53.530\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n91\n00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.080\n&gt;&gt; And formulas, if you want to say.\n\n92\n00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.231\nIt's like logos.\n\n93\n00:03:56.231 --> 00:03:57.840\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; You create your company\n\n94\n00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.530\nlogos in Illustrator because that way you\ncan put it on the side of the building,\n\n95\n00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.460\non a poster or something like that.\n\n96\n00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.960\nYou just go ahead and\nmake it as big as you want.\n\n97\n00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.920\nAnd so that's the whole idea.\n\n98\n00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.632\nSo a little bit of back knowledge,\nand I love to talk about that stuff.\n\n99\n00:04:11.632 --> 00:04:13.867\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I could see your geek flag just\n\n100\n00:04:13.867 --> 00:04:15.195\na-flying as hard as it could.\n\n101\n00:04:15.195 --> 00:04:17.120\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, pretty much.\n\n102\n00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.360\nSo we're gonna add a shape.\n\n103\n00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.530\nAnd like I said, in Office products\nit does act like vector information.\n\n104\n00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.624\nWe can make it as big as we want because\nit's not going to really worry about\n\n105\n00:04:28.624 --> 00:04:29.625\nthe blurriness.\n\n106\n00:04:29.625 --> 00:04:33.666\nBut I don't wanna say this is true vector\ncuz who knows what type of layers and\n\n107\n00:04:33.666 --> 00:04:34.690\nstuff is going on.\n\n108\n00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.890\n&gt;&gt; What voodoo is happening\nbehind the scenes, right?\n\n109\n00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:37.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, totally.\n\n110\n00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.668\n&gt;&gt; Microsoft, you wizards, you.\n\n111\n00:04:39.668 --> 00:04:42.790\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n112\n00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.250\n[LAUGH] So let's go ahead and\nput in a rectangle.\n\n113\n00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.020\nSo I've gotten to the shapes and\nI've dropped down here, all of my shapes.\n\n114\n00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.810\nThe way that I equate this is\nit's like a box of crayons.\n\n115\n00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.819\nAnd what you need to do is you need\nto pull the crayon out of the box and\n\n116\n00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:59.913\nthen draw where you want\nthat crayon to be drawn on.\n\n117\n00:04:59.913 --> 00:05:00.680\nLike a piece of paper.\n\n118\n00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.050\nSo it's the same thing here.\n\n119\n00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.850\nCuz people will go ahead and\nclick the rectangle, and they're like,\n\n120\n00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.100\nwell, where's the rectangle?\n\n121\n00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.850\nNow you draw it.\n\n122\n00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.648\nOkay, it's in your hand, let's draw.\n\n123\n00:05:09.648 --> 00:05:13.280\nThere's two ways that\nyou can add a shape in.\n\n124\n00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.120\nYou can either single click,\njust click all by itself.\n\n125\n00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.495\nAnd then it adds in the shape\ninto its default size,\n\n126\n00:05:21.495 --> 00:05:26.030\naspect ratio, proportions, and\ncolor, and everything like that.\n\n127\n00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.200\nSo this is where it has, it looks\npretty much like a perfect square.\n\n128\n00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.750\nSo grab the crayon, single click.\n\n129\n00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.330\nOr, let's go back over into Insert\n&gt; Illustrations &gt; Shapes and\n\n130\n00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.900\nwe will click on the rectangle tool again.\n\n131\n00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.700\nOr you can click, hold, and drag to make\nthe shape whatever size that you want.\n\n132\n00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.518\nSo if I click, hold, and drag, and this\nis one of those that I can go ahead and\n\n133\n00:05:47.518 --> 00:05:50.790\nmake it more of a rectangle\nrather than a square.\n\n134\n00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.282\nI'm still holding the mouse button\ndown right now so I have not let go.\n\n135\n00:05:53.282 --> 00:05:56.965\nCuz as soon as you let go then you've\ncommitted to that's the shape that I want.\n\n136\n00:05:56.965 --> 00:06:01.784\nBut if I wanted to keep it into a perfect\nsquare or into the perfect proportions\n\n137\n00:06:01.784 --> 00:06:05.430\nthat that shape is created,\nyou hold your Shift key down.\n\n138\n00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.005\nAnd if you hold your Shift key\ndown while you're dragging.\n\n139\n00:06:08.005 --> 00:06:11.270\nYou notice how I can,\nyou can't really see it on my mouse,\n\n140\n00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.740\nbut I'm moving in or out to go ahead and\nmake it more like a rectangle.\n\n141\n00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.900\nBut since that Shift key is held down,\nit will always maintain that aspect ratio,\n\n142\n00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.180\nor proportions if you want to say.\n\n143\n00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.520\nAnd maintain the perfect square.\n\n144\n00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.580\nBut the one thing is make\nsure you let go of the mouse\n\n145\n00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.430\nfirst before you let go of the Shift key.\n\n146\n00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.879\nBecause, if sometimes you let go\nof the shift just slightly before,\n\n147\n00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:35.089\nthen it goes right back\ndown to a rectangle.\n\n148\n00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:37.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So keep that in mind.\n\n149\n00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.630\nAnd so now I have created this shape.\n\n150\n00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.130\nI know that this shape is selected\nbecause we have the dots around it.\n\n151\n00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.840\nAnd I have my four-pointed\narrow when I hover over it,\n\n152\n00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.860\nwhich means that I can move it around.\n\n153\n00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.960\nComing over here to this other square, if\nI want to select this you single click it,\n\n154\n00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.740\nand then drag it to where you want\nit to go, and then you can move it.\n\n155\n00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.274\nSo you know that you have your selection\nbecause of those little dots around it.\n\n156\n00:07:01.274 --> 00:07:05.088\nAnd the other thing is that little swirly\nthing at the top, that's your rotation.\n\n157\n00:07:05.088 --> 00:07:09.262\nThat's another indication that this\nelement, this graphical element,\n\n158\n00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:12.988\nis selected, so just kinda watching for\nthose different things.\n\n159\n00:07:12.988 --> 00:07:17.115\nSo go into your shapes,\nfind all your shape crayons, draw it, and\n\n160\n00:07:17.115 --> 00:07:20.898\nthen now we're going to start\ntalking about formatting it.\n\n161\n00:07:20.898 --> 00:07:22.923\nFirst of all, what about resizing it?\n\n162\n00:07:22.923 --> 00:07:25.660\nI like this square right here but\nit's not big enough.\n\n163\n00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.820\nJust grab a corner or a side.\n\n164\n00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.510\nNow, this is the one that is\na little different than images.\n\n165\n00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:34.880\nWhen you went to the corner of an image,\nit automatically\n\n166\n00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.960\nmaintained those proportions, and\nit didn't squash or stretch your image.\n\n167\n00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.570\nWith a shape, you will have to\nhold your Shift key down again cuz\n\n168\n00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.400\nthat Shift key will maintain proportions.\n\n169\n00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.420\nAnd that way you can go ahead and make it\nbigger or smaller with the resizing and\n\n170\n00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.530\nit keeps it in that proportion.\n\n171\n00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:55.184\nKeeping that idea of letting\ngo of the mouse first and\n\n172\n00:07:55.184 --> 00:07:56.882\nthen letting go of the Shift key.\n\n173\n00:07:56.882 --> 00:07:58.279\nSo that's how you can resize it.\n\n174\n00:07:58.279 --> 00:08:00.913\nCuz if I did want it to be more\nof a rectangle, I can do that.\n\n175\n00:08:00.913 --> 00:08:02.426\nThere's nothing wrong with that.\n\n176\n00:08:02.426 --> 00:08:06.813\nWe can go ahead and use it independently\nbecause there's nothing to squash or\n\n177\n00:08:06.813 --> 00:08:08.440\nstretch like a photograph.\n\n178\n00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:15.420\nYay, so now we've got our different\nways we can move it, we can size it.\n\n179\n00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:21.150\nHow about changing the properties\nof this shape with our fills and\n\n180\n00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:22.850\nI almost had strokes but because I was.\n\n181\n00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:24.250\nWe'll talk about this later.\n\n182\n00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:25.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; They're outlines, okay but\n\n183\n00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:27.640\nthe stroke is the outline.\n\n184\n00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:32.350\nSo we're gonna come up into the format\ncontextual tab because of course you can\n\n185\n00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:37.110\nsee that this tab will come up based on\nthe fact that I have a shape selected.\n\n186\n00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:39.969\nAnd this is where we need\nto have our options for us.\n\n187\n00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:46.050\nShape fill, drop this down, here all of\nthe fit, the colors that we can choose,\n\n188\n00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:49.090\nwe have seen this when we\nwere formatting our text.\n\n189\n00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:52.090\nWe were looking at the outlines\nof the photographs, so\n\n190\n00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:55.800\nyou see this in a lot of different\nplaces so it should look very familiar.\n\n191\n00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:01.220\nIt is based on your themes, so if you have\na document theme that's going across here,\n\n192\n00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.870\nthen that's what you're\ngoing to have your colors.\n\n193\n00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:05.440\nBut the nice thing is you can\nalways come into more colors and\n\n194\n00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.930\nget to the exact place\nthat you want to go.\n\n195\n00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:11.200\nThis recent color was because\nI had this file saved and\n\n196\n00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.390\nof course, I chose pink, imagine that.\n\n197\n00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:19.280\nSo I've got that, but if I go into\nmore fill colors you have two tabs.\n\n198\n00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.330\nYou have your standard tab, where it looks\nlike crayons again, and I can choose.\n\n199\n00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:28.166\nYou also have your custom tab,\nbecause if I needed it to\n\n200\n00:09:28.166 --> 00:09:32.595\nbe specifically IT Pro TV orange or\nIT Pro TV blue.\n\n201\n00:09:32.595 --> 00:09:36.988\nThe people or the person that has created\nthis logo for us, they went ahead and\n\n202\n00:09:36.988 --> 00:09:38.620\npicked our company colors.\n\n203\n00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.990\nAll of our branding that we have done.\n\n204\n00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:46.790\nSo there is a specific value for\nITProTV orange.\n\n205\n00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:50.619\nNow I would have to ask somebody\nto get that specific numbers but\n\n206\n00:09:50.619 --> 00:09:55.570\nyou can see that there's a color model\nknown as RGB, red, green and blue.\n\n207\n00:09:55.570 --> 00:10:00.300\nAnd these different combinations\nof light will go ahead and\n\n208\n00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.990\ncombine to make that particular orange.\n\n209\n00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:05.530\nSo if I had those values,\nI could go ahead and type those in.\n\n210\n00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:08.820\nNow your color models only work on RGB and\nHSL.\n\n211\n00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:12.010\nHSL is a color model that, it's there.\n\n212\n00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:15.850\nI wouldn't say that it's the most\ncommon one, but RGB is very common.\n\n213\n00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:17.490\nDoesn't work on CMYK or Pantones.\n\n214\n00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:20.880\nIf you're like, I have no idea what you're\ntalking about don't worry, it's okay.\n\n215\n00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:26.920\nIt's just different ways of measuring\ncolors within graphics and everything.\n\n216\n00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:27.690\nSo letting you know.\n\n217\n00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:30.400\nOr, if you're like, I don't know\nthe number, just move the thing around,\n\n218\n00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.930\nmove the slider up and down, like-\n&gt;&gt; That's typically how I do it.\n\n219\n00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:33.840\n&gt;&gt; Right?\nIt's like you know what,\n\n220\n00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.460\nI think that shade of pinky purple,\n\n221\n00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:39.570\nI think that's a little bit\nof a mauve right there.\n\n222\n00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:41.390\nSo I'll go ahead and\nsay yeah that's what I want and\n\n223\n00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:45.930\nthen you click OK and you're off to\nthe races with your custom colors.\n\n224\n00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:49.830\nThere's a couple more things that\nyou can do with your shape fills.\n\n225\n00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:55.060\nThis is where you get down into your,\nnow you can add a picture which is weird.\n\n226\n00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:58.345\nIt's like hm, why would I-\n&gt;&gt; Add a picture when I can just\n\n227\n00:10:58.345 --> 00:10:59.280\nadd a picture?\n\n228\n00:10:59.280 --> 00:10:59.913\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n229\n00:10:59.913 --> 00:11:01.794\nWell the other thing when\nwe in the images episode,\n\n230\n00:11:01.794 --> 00:11:03.340\nremember when we did that cross to shape.\n\n231\n00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So we took Flago and\n\n232\n00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.380\nmade him into a little heart.\n\n233\n00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.770\n&gt;&gt; Kind of reverse of\nwhat we're doing now.\n\n234\n00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:10.480\nWe're making a shape and\nthen adding a picture to it.\n\n235\n00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:15.170\nYeah, so to me it's this-\n&gt;&gt; Six of one, half a dozen of the other?\n\n236\n00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:17.000\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so I'm like,\nI'm glad you can say that.\n\n237\n00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.110\nCuz I'm like, I know there's a saying that\nsays 12's and 6's and something like that.\n\n238\n00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:23.620\nSo you can see that I could\ninsert a picture from file.\n\n239\n00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:27.960\nBut you will have to be\nconscientious of your resolution.\n\n240\n00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.030\nSo if it's too small or too big, so\n\n241\n00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:33.050\nI could go ahead and\nfill it in with little Bishop.\n\n242\n00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:36.300\nHe's a cute little anglic\nwho's laying under my chair.\n\n243\n00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.510\nAnd so I took a picture down.\n\n244\n00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:38.157\nHe was like, hey.\n\n245\n00:11:38.157 --> 00:11:39.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He was so adorable, so.\n\n246\n00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.290\nOkay, I started talking\nabout my adorable cat.\n\n247\n00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:44.430\nI'm like, what am I doing?\n\n248\n00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:48.180\nWe're back into our fill, we're gonna\ngo into some gradients and textures.\n\n249\n00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:49.770\nNow the textures always get me.\n\n250\n00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:54.390\nIf you watch any of my other shows one of\nmy favorite textures is the The dead fish\n\n251\n00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:57.160\nas I call it,\nthe fossil fish it's like mm-hm yeah,\n\n252\n00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.120\ncuz that's what everybody wants.\n\n253\n00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:03.305\n&gt;&gt; That's right, I don't want dead fish\non my screen, that's always a good time.\n\n254\n00:12:03.305 --> 00:12:07.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Those are kind of fun with\nthe textures, I mean the bubbles are cute,\n\n255\n00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:12.630\nso I always pick out the dead fish\ntexture, but I do love a gradient.\n\n256\n00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:15.410\nI love me a gradient, so\nwhen we come over here, now\n\n257\n00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:19.290\nthis is just picking from whatever color\n&gt;&gt; That was\n\n258\n00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:21.710\nlike on by default with\nlike our theme colors and\n\n259\n00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:25.840\nis showing us some different variations\nof like a lighter to that color or\n\n260\n00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.930\ndarker to that color, and it's like,\nI don't really like any of these.\n\n261\n00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:31.290\nSo down at the bottom we're\ngonna go to more gradients.\n\n262\n00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:33.790\nAnd what's gonna happen is\nover on the right hand side\n\n263\n00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:37.050\nwe're going to bring up\nthe format picture task pane.\n\n264\n00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:39.270\nAnd so\nthere's a lot of options in here, and\n\n265\n00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:41.500\nthere's a couple more\nbehind my head as well.\n\n266\n00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:46.180\nSo you can see the full thing we've\ngot all of these different options\n\n267\n00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:49.090\nin like the transparency, the tiling.\n\n268\n00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:49.860\nLots and lots of stuff.\n\n269\n00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:53.710\nWe've seen this a little bit in the images\nepisode when we were going into\n\n270\n00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:59.670\nthe effects with all of the shadows, and\nall those sliders that we can go through.\n\n271\n00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:04.140\nAnd back of course here, with our shapes,\nwe can come into our fill, and\n\n272\n00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:07.100\nwe wanna choose gradient\nover here on the right.\n\n273\n00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.240\nAnd then if I scroll down a little bit,\n\n274\n00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.070\nthis is where you can start\ncontrolling your gradient.\n\n275\n00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:15.290\nThere are some presets in here\nthat go by your theme color.\n\n276\n00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:19.190\nSo, lets just maybe pick this first one,\nwith this orange.\n\n277\n00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:22.430\nAnd then what type do you want, and\nthere is some linear and radials and\n\n278\n00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:23.560\nsome other ones that come along.\n\n279\n00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:28.360\nBut when you have a gradient,\nyou have a gradient ramp and\n\n280\n00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:32.100\nthere are what are known as\ncolor stops along that ramp.\n\n281\n00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:36.240\nAnd then what you do is you change\nthe color of the stops, and\n\n282\n00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:40.370\nthat will then gradiate, I don't think\nthat's a real word, [LAUGH] I make it up.\n\n283\n00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:42.530\nWhere it goes out and\nblends between those two colors.\n\n284\n00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:46.540\nSo if I wanted to make like more\nof a rainbow greeting cuz I\n\n285\n00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:47.880\nalways have to make my rainbow greetings.\n\n286\n00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.780\nSo if I click here on the very\nfirst house and I call it a house.\n\n287\n00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:53.760\nI'm sorry because in my other program.\n\n288\n00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.110\n&gt;&gt; Looks like the Monopoly\nhotel upside down.\n\n289\n00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:57.365\n&gt;&gt; It does doesn't it right.\n\n290\n00:13:57.365 --> 00:13:59.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is an upside down house,\n\n291\n00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:02.150\nin Photoshop and\neverything it's turned the other way so\n\n292\n00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:03.600\nit looks like houses to me.\n\n293\n00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.650\nThat's the terminology I normally use.\n\n294\n00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:07.467\n&gt;&gt; These are laying on\nthe Wicked Witch of the East.\n\n295\n00:14:07.467 --> 00:14:10.180\n[LAUGH] Cuz they're upside down.\n\n296\n00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:10.905\n&gt;&gt; Exactly Daniel, so.\n\n297\n00:14:10.905 --> 00:14:14.915\nAnd now were going to have this house\nselected or up side down has selected,\n\n298\n00:14:14.915 --> 00:14:19.175\nI'm gonna zoom back out so we can go ahead\nand see the rest of what is on the screen.\n\n299\n00:14:19.175 --> 00:14:22.065\nI have that on and\nthen right down here we have our colors,\n\n300\n00:14:22.065 --> 00:14:23.842\nthen we can pick from our colors.\n\n301\n00:14:23.842 --> 00:14:27.542\nWe'll go with pink and\nthere we have some other houses to select.\n\n302\n00:14:27.542 --> 00:14:30.022\nNow, the thing is like\nI have too many houses,\n\n303\n00:14:30.022 --> 00:14:32.952\nI really want three houses,\nI don't want four.\n\n304\n00:14:32.952 --> 00:14:37.512\nSo when you that house selected on the\nright, you can either add another house or\n\n305\n00:14:37.512 --> 00:14:40.920\nin this case you can\nremove one of this houses.\n\n306\n00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.550\nWe have that removed,\nthen we'll select this one.\n\n307\n00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:47.770\nSo if you take pink to then yellow and\n\n308\n00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:51.820\nthen select that last house and\nthen go to blue, look at that.\n\n309\n00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:53.345\n&gt;&gt; My goodness, it's a rainbow.\n\n310\n00:14:53.345 --> 00:14:56.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You're right and\nit also reminds you of cotton candy and\n\n311\n00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:57.910\neverything like that so.\n\n312\n00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:59.000\nMakes me very happy.\n\n313\n00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.670\n&gt;&gt; With you it makes me think of unicorns,\nbecause I know how much you love unicorns.\n\n314\n00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:05.415\nAnd for whatever reason this\nmakes me think unicorns.\n\n315\n00:15:05.415 --> 00:15:08.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I love that,\nwe'll keep on going with the unicorn.\n\n316\n00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:13.320\nAnd so that way we have some different\nways we can change our gradient stops.\n\n317\n00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.380\nYou can move them around and\nchange what you want it to look like.\n\n318\n00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:19.900\nSo it's really up to you but\nat least you know now where to get to it.\n\n319\n00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:24.650\nYou get into the more options or you\ncan go into the format shape task pane.\n\n320\n00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:28.190\nYou can also get to it by right\nclicking here, let me close this and\n\n321\n00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:31.480\nif I right click on this square\nthere's format shape and\n\n322\n00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:34.280\nI can go right into the place\nthat we were just at.\n\n323\n00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:39.810\nWe have gotten to it from the fill more\ncolors, or more gradients within here.\n\n324\n00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:42.330\nSo that's a lot of fun.\n\n325\n00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:46.836\nAnd just for a little bit more on\nthis particular format task pane,\n\n326\n00:15:46.836 --> 00:15:50.945\nbecause we were doing a gradient fill for\nthe, well, fill.\n\n327\n00:15:50.945 --> 00:15:54.825\n[LAUGH] You could also do\nthe same thing for the line.\n\n328\n00:15:54.825 --> 00:15:58.215\nYou could make a gradient\nline in there as well.\n\n329\n00:15:58.215 --> 00:16:00.870\nSo I could take this and\nthen make something different.\n\n330\n00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:04.292\nNow it's like, you can't really see\nit too much but if I go ahead and\n\n331\n00:16:04.292 --> 00:16:08.451\nmake the width, let's make it like 35,\nso you can really see it, there you go.\n\n332\n00:16:08.451 --> 00:16:11.614\nSo now the width, or the stroke,\nsorry I keep saying that,\n\n333\n00:16:11.614 --> 00:16:15.287\n[LAUGH] the outline with the width\nmore defined, you could go ahead and\n\n334\n00:16:15.287 --> 00:16:19.241\nthen start creating your gradient stops\nin there, and so on and so forth.\n\n335\n00:16:19.241 --> 00:16:25.611\nSo it's not just for the fill,\nit is for the outline as well.\n\n336\n00:16:25.611 --> 00:16:28.451\nSo some fun stuff and\ngood things to know about.\n\n337\n00:16:28.451 --> 00:16:31.155\nSo you can tweak, and tweak,\nand keeping on tweaking.\n\n338\n00:16:31.155 --> 00:16:32.332\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n339\n00:16:32.332 --> 00:16:35.035\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we've got our fills and\n\n340\n00:16:35.035 --> 00:16:38.258\nour outlines, and\nthen we have our effects.\n\n341\n00:16:38.258 --> 00:16:40.618\nThe effects are the same things\nwe could do for our images.\n\n342\n00:16:40.618 --> 00:16:44.170\nWe could do shadows, and\nreflections, and glows.\n\n343\n00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:47.280\nI'm not gonna go through each one of\nthese, because they are pretty self\n\n344\n00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:51.250\nexplanatory by the little graphics there,\nlike what this is going to do,\n\n345\n00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:55.870\nand then of course coming down into the\nshadow options, that's going right back\n\n346\n00:16:55.870 --> 00:17:00.880\nover into our format shape where we have\na bunch of different sliders in there.\n\n347\n00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:04.120\nBut I usually kinda stick with the,\nwe're on the specs,\n\n348\n00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:09.740\nI kinda stick with the presets that are in\nhere, maybe change a glow color, cuz maybe\n\n349\n00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:15.690\nwe need our unicorn to glow in pink, so\nthen I can change those different options.\n\n350\n00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:18.790\nI keep wanna go to outline [LAUGH],\ninto the glow and\n\n351\n00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:21.520\nthen change our glow color to pink.\n\n352\n00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.793\nPerfect.\n\n353\n00:17:22.793 --> 00:17:26.760\nSo all the effects that you can\ndo on your different shapes.\n\n354\n00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:31.624\nAll right, so let's talk about drawing\njust a line, okay, cuz these right\n\n355\n00:17:31.624 --> 00:17:36.582\nhere are known as closed paths in the\nvector world, they close on each other.\n\n356\n00:17:36.582 --> 00:17:39.970\nBut, and then you have an open path,\nwhere it's just a line,\n\n357\n00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:44.012\nbecause a line is the distance between\ntwo points, back into a geometry,\n\n358\n00:17:44.012 --> 00:17:45.919\none of my favorite math subjects.\n\n359\n00:17:45.919 --> 00:17:46.456\n&gt;&gt; Amen sister.\n\n360\n00:17:46.456 --> 00:17:46.971\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n361\n00:17:46.971 --> 00:17:48.535\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Give me geometry any day.\n\n362\n00:17:48.535 --> 00:17:50.007\n&gt;&gt; Forget that stupid algebra.\n\n363\n00:17:50.007 --> 00:17:50.846\nI hated algebra.\n\n364\n00:17:50.846 --> 00:17:55.698\n&gt;&gt; I was not good at, I mean, I did it,\nI just didn't like it and it, no.\n\n365\n00:17:55.698 --> 00:17:56.863\n&gt;&gt; I did it poorly.\n\n366\n00:17:56.863 --> 00:17:58.686\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n367\n00:17:58.686 --> 00:18:01.159\nI had a really good algebra\nteacher in high school.\n\n368\n00:18:01.159 --> 00:18:04.367\nI will say that, so I think that's\nthe only reason why it saved me.\n\n369\n00:18:04.367 --> 00:18:09.904\nSo yes, Miss Hubbard if you're out there,\nyou are awesome [LAUGH].\n\n370\n00:18:09.904 --> 00:18:11.200\nLines, there we go.\n\n371\n00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.607\nSo I'm gonna come over\nhere to my line shape, and\n\n372\n00:18:13.607 --> 00:18:16.952\nthe one thing I wanted to point out is,\nif I just click hold and drag,\n\n373\n00:18:16.952 --> 00:18:21.150\nlet's just draw a line over here, that's\nfine, and I still have the same options.\n\n374\n00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:24.760\nNotice there's no fill option,\nbecause you can't have a fill in a line.\n\n375\n00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.690\n&gt;&gt; Nothing to fill.\n&gt;&gt; There's no inside, yes.\n\n376\n00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:30.995\nSo we're only outside on our outline,\nand then you can come into your weights,\n\n377\n00:18:30.995 --> 00:18:34.142\nand so on, and so forth, and\nstill do effects, and that,\n\n378\n00:18:34.142 --> 00:18:38.282\nbut the neat thing that you can do with\nyour lines, let's go back over to it.\n\n379\n00:18:38.282 --> 00:18:42.264\nDo you see like when I started\nmoving my mouse over the shapes?\n\n380\n00:18:42.264 --> 00:18:43.654\nThe dots come on,\n\n381\n00:18:43.654 --> 00:18:49.240\nthese little dots of where you can\nanchor lines between two shapes.\n\n382\n00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:52.479\nSo if I hover right here on this dot,\nand I click,\n\n383\n00:18:52.479 --> 00:18:56.982\nhold, and then I drag over to this dot,\nand then let go, and again,\n\n384\n00:18:56.982 --> 00:19:00.465\nI'll make this a little thicker so\nyou can see this.\n\n385\n00:19:00.465 --> 00:19:03.525\nWhen I move each shape, they're connected.\n\n386\n00:19:03.525 --> 00:19:04.170\n&gt;&gt; Hm-mm.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n387\n00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:06.884\n&gt;&gt; Like you said,\nthey're anchored to each other, so\n\n388\n00:19:06.884 --> 00:19:08.987\nif one moves then the line moves with it.\n\n389\n00:19:08.987 --> 00:19:12.404\n&gt;&gt; A lot of times you do this with\nflow charts, or the diagrams,\n\n390\n00:19:12.404 --> 00:19:15.425\nwhat happens yes or no, and\nthen move the thing down.\n\n391\n00:19:15.425 --> 00:19:17.729\n&gt;&gt; A lot of times what I do is I\ncreate shapes, and then I draw lines,\n\n392\n00:19:17.729 --> 00:19:19.932\nthen I move it, then I go well I\nguess I have to draw new lines.\n\n393\n00:19:19.932 --> 00:19:21.003\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n394\n00:19:21.003 --> 00:19:24.225\nwith here they know the shape moves,\nI am connected.\n\n395\n00:19:24.225 --> 00:19:27.777\nBut I had to say, from this connector\npoint to this connector point,\n\n396\n00:19:27.777 --> 00:19:29.688\notherwise it would be free flowing.\n\n397\n00:19:29.688 --> 00:19:30.254\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n398\n00:19:30.254 --> 00:19:31.941\n&gt;&gt; And all of that kind of fun stuff.\n\n399\n00:19:31.941 --> 00:19:37.141\nSo it's kinda like a seesaw or\na tether, so fun stuff.\n\n400\n00:19:37.141 --> 00:19:40.151\nLet's talk about adding shape to,\nno text to our shape, so\n\n401\n00:19:40.151 --> 00:19:41.550\nswitch that around [LAUGH].\n\n402\n00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:43.800\n&gt;&gt; Shapes to our text.\n\n403\n00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:48.708\n&gt;&gt; This is one that, it's almost to\nsimple and it's really complicated.\n\n404\n00:19:48.708 --> 00:19:53.386\nThis is, yeah, cause people go and\nthey wanna find the add text button or\n\n405\n00:19:53.386 --> 00:19:55.040\nput a text box on top of it.\n\n406\n00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:59.454\nNo, just have the shape you want to have\ntext added to it and just start typing.\n\n407\n00:19:59.454 --> 00:20:03.037\nIf I say, add text,\nthat's really all it was.\n\n408\n00:20:03.037 --> 00:20:07.126\nNow it's really small because I'm zoomed\nout, but let's zoom in a little bit,\n\n409\n00:20:07.126 --> 00:20:08.720\nthere you go, that's it.\n\n410\n00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:13.316\nSelect and start typing, and then once I\nget in there you notice I have an I beam\n\n411\n00:20:13.316 --> 00:20:17.982\nin there, so I can select the text and\nthen come in to this, and let's make this\n\n412\n00:20:17.982 --> 00:20:22.294\na little bit bigger, and notice I did\ngo back to the Home tab to go ahead and\n\n413\n00:20:22.294 --> 00:20:25.239\nthen format the text,\nhowever which way I like.\n\n414\n00:20:25.239 --> 00:20:26.462\nNow, red's not gonna work.\n\n415\n00:20:26.462 --> 00:20:27.718\nSo [LAUGH]-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n416\n00:20:27.718 --> 00:20:28.275\n&gt;&gt; Actually,\n\n417\n00:20:28.275 --> 00:20:29.670\nI did like the white in there.\n\n418\n00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:34.345\nSo I'm gonna change that fill color to\nwhite, and you can still do the formatting\n\n419\n00:20:34.345 --> 00:20:38.421\nhere, of like a centering it,\nmaybe if I make it a little bit smaller.\n\n420\n00:20:38.421 --> 00:20:43.351\nNow you can see that it is centered, and\nyou also have your vertical alignments,\n\n421\n00:20:43.351 --> 00:20:47.356\nso I could align it to the middle\nof this shape, and go from there.\n\n422\n00:20:47.356 --> 00:20:50.285\nNow when I have text added, and\nI know it's kinda hard to read,\n\n423\n00:20:50.285 --> 00:20:52.407\nlike the white text on that yellow,-\n&gt;&gt; On the lighter background there.\n\n424\n00:20:52.407 --> 00:20:56.737\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, coming back over to the format,\nthat's why you have this group within your\n\n425\n00:20:56.737 --> 00:21:00.080\nshapes, cuz people are like,\nI don't have any words in here.\n\n426\n00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:06.070\nWell, if you add [LAUGH] text into it,\nthen you can do your different text fills,\n\n427\n00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:10.560\nand outlines, and effects just the same\nway that you did on your shapes,\n\n428\n00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.470\nyou can do it in the text\nthat inside of that shape,\n\n429\n00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:17.420\nand you have some presets in here that\nreally is, it's really Word art, and\n\n430\n00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:21.346\nso, I can add it into there and so\nmaybe making like a darker text and\n\n431\n00:21:21.346 --> 00:21:25.330\nit also has that drop shadow and\nthe double outline.\n\n432\n00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:28.692\nSo that way,\nyou can get a little fancier there,\n\n433\n00:21:28.692 --> 00:21:32.887\na little bit more gussing going\non in this particular shape.\n\n434\n00:21:32.887 --> 00:21:35.865\nNow we already talked about doing\nthe format shape task paints.\n\n435\n00:21:35.865 --> 00:21:40.510\nWe can do all of the different things\nthat we are working with in here and\n\n436\n00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:44.805\nwith our effects, and our fills,\nand strokes, and outlines.\n\n437\n00:21:44.805 --> 00:21:48.019\n[LAUGH] It's really hard\nto make myself say that.\n\n438\n00:21:48.019 --> 00:21:49.670\nWhat else do I wanna show you?\n\n439\n00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:50.870\nThis is a fun one.\n\n440\n00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:53.130\nSo I will zoom out.\n\n441\n00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:57.000\nSome of these shapes,, now this is just\na square, basic square, that's fine.\n\n442\n00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.049\nSome of the shapes that we have in\nhere can do some fun little things.\n\n443\n00:22:01.049 --> 00:22:05.388\nWe go over here and choose,\nlet's choose good old lightning.\n\n444\n00:22:05.388 --> 00:22:09.140\nWe'll take our lightning strike and\nwe'll just [NOISE] just draw that.\n\n445\n00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:11.895\nIt's always good to make sound effects,-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n446\n00:22:11.895 --> 00:22:12.910\n&gt;&gt; While you do it.\n\n447\n00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:15.410\nYeah, because we are-\n&gt;&gt; Team Lightning.\n\n448\n00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:19.582\n&gt;&gt; Yes, if you all don't know out here,\nwe are Team Lightning, you, me and Titus.\n\n449\n00:22:19.582 --> 00:22:20.206\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n450\n00:22:20.206 --> 00:22:25.131\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna come over here and\nwe're gonna maybe rotate that around, and\n\n451\n00:22:25.131 --> 00:22:30.070\nof course this also my favorite hockey\nteam, [LAUGH] so it's double in there.\n\n452\n00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:31.950\n&gt;&gt; It's also the emblem on\nCaptain Marvel's chest.\n\n453\n00:22:33.798 --> 00:22:34.412\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n454\n00:22:34.412 --> 00:22:35.061\nI will take your word for it.\n\n455\n00:22:35.061 --> 00:22:37.885\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; For you comic geeks out there.\n\n456\n00:22:37.885 --> 00:22:40.165\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We cover all the bases here [LAUGH].\n\n457\n00:22:40.165 --> 00:22:44.671\nSo now, I have this lightning, and there's\nsome things that I can do with this, and\n\n458\n00:22:44.671 --> 00:22:47.970\nactually, I just realized,\nI skipped to the next part.\n\n459\n00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:49.380\nThere's two options I wanted to do.\n\n460\n00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:52.980\nThis is where we're gonna do our\nedit the shape with the points.\n\n461\n00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:58.814\nBecause this is going into every\nindividual point and then moving them\n\n462\n00:22:58.814 --> 00:23:03.686\naround cuz maybe I need to make the\nlightning bolt at the top a little wider.\n\n463\n00:23:03.686 --> 00:23:08.446\nIf you click on edit points,\nnotice every single point comes up for\n\n464\n00:23:08.446 --> 00:23:10.241\nyou to be able to change.\n\n465\n00:23:10.241 --> 00:23:12.435\nNow this isn't the whole,\nsome of these shapes have some really fun\n\n466\n00:23:12.435 --> 00:23:13.158\nstuff,-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n467\n00:23:13.158 --> 00:23:14.030\n&gt;&gt; Or some really cute things.\n\n468\n00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:15.656\nThat's in the next,\nI just kinda flipped things around.\n\n469\n00:23:15.656 --> 00:23:16.600\n&gt;&gt; That's okay.\n\n470\n00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:19.287\nSo just roll with me, guys,\nI'll come right on back around [LAUGH].\n\n471\n00:23:19.287 --> 00:23:20.223\n&gt;&gt; This seems really fun, too.\n\n472\n00:23:20.223 --> 00:23:22.803\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is, cuz this gets more into how\n\n473\n00:23:22.803 --> 00:23:27.228\nIllustrator does work, because anywhere\nthat you have a closed or an open path,\n\n474\n00:23:27.228 --> 00:23:31.457\nyou have points along that path, and\nhow you change, you can go into the point\n\n475\n00:23:31.457 --> 00:23:36.209\nlevel and choose them, which is exactly\nwhat we're doing here say, well, why don't\n\n476\n00:23:36.209 --> 00:23:40.551\nI take this one point, and I'm gonna go\nahead and extend this out a little bit.\n\n477\n00:23:40.551 --> 00:23:42.849\nMaybe extend this guy out a little bit.\n\n478\n00:23:42.849 --> 00:23:44.495\nNo, now that's not looking like\na lightning bolt anymore [LAUGH].\n\n479\n00:23:44.495 --> 00:23:45.638\n&gt;&gt; That's looking bad [LAUGH].\n\n480\n00:23:45.638 --> 00:23:51.847\n&gt;&gt; So now we're kind of morphing\ninto team weird thing going on.\n\n481\n00:23:51.847 --> 00:23:52.871\n&gt;&gt; Team post-modern art.\n\n482\n00:23:52.871 --> 00:23:56.500\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly, [LAUGH] or the Mod Squad,\n\n483\n00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:57.563\nor something.\n\n484\n00:23:57.563 --> 00:23:58.123\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n485\n00:23:58.123 --> 00:24:00.353\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So it's-\n&gt;&gt; Cubists [LAUGH]\n\n486\n00:24:00.353 --> 00:24:00.977\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes,\n\n487\n00:24:00.977 --> 00:24:02.474\nI was an art history major and\n\n488\n00:24:02.474 --> 00:24:04.829\nit's all escaping me right now [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n489\n00:24:04.829 --> 00:24:06.247\n&gt;&gt; But you can go ahead and\n\n490\n00:24:06.247 --> 00:24:07.521\nedit these points.\n\n491\n00:24:07.521 --> 00:24:09.320\nAnd not to get too deep into this,\n\n492\n00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:13.630\ncuz this is a whole couple of episodes\nwhen we talk about Illustrator.\n\n493\n00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:16.270\nYou have what are known as Bezier handles,\n\n494\n00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:20.982\ncuz you have the French mathematician that\ncreated different curves in your lines.\n\n495\n00:24:20.982 --> 00:24:24.758\n&gt;&gt; It's a really interesting article, you\nshould look it up, it's in Wikipedia, but\n\n496\n00:24:24.758 --> 00:24:28.927\nread about it, it's really neat,\nit's all about coming from designing cars.\n\n497\n00:24:28.927 --> 00:24:31.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nI know you guys are big car buffs.\n\n498\n00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:32.300\n&gt;&gt; We are a little bit.\n\n499\n00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:34.150\n&gt;&gt; I'll have to show you that.\n\n500\n00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:38.830\nBut notice how I'm making these lines or\nthis point,\n\n501\n00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:42.000\nthey're not straight,\nthey're now becoming curved.\n\n502\n00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.227\nAnd so these Bezier handles, I sometimes\ncall them seesaws, you can pull the seesaw\n\n503\n00:24:46.227 --> 00:24:47.006\n&gt;&gt; Can you do that again?\n\n504\n00:24:47.006 --> 00:24:47.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n505\n00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:48.750\n&gt;&gt; Can you do the little shimmy?\n\n506\n00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:51.643\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n507\n00:24:51.643 --> 00:24:52.880\n&gt;&gt; I'm like what did I do?\n\n508\n00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.511\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm demonstrating\n\n509\n00:24:55.511 --> 00:24:57.062\nthat the Bezier seesaw.\n\n510\n00:24:57.062 --> 00:25:00.552\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; So I can take this and notice that it's\n\n511\n00:25:00.552 --> 00:25:05.900\ncurving how the path comes into\nthis point and then how it leaves.\n\n512\n00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:10.380\nAnd so you can start making some really\ninteresting types of shapes going on\n\n513\n00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:13.910\nhere by grabbing those handles and\nbeing able to change it.\n\n514\n00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:18.560\nLike I said, not going to far into it but\njust hey, grab it, pull it around and\n\n515\n00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:23.100\nsee what happens and you're like okay,\nwell this is my exploding comb?\n\n516\n00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:26.118\n[LAUGH] We'll go with that.\n\n517\n00:25:26.118 --> 00:25:31.208\nAll right, now, where I was going first,\nI got really distracted by the lightning,\n\n518\n00:25:31.208 --> 00:25:34.388\nas I really wanted to talk\nabout the lightning, but,\n\n519\n00:25:34.388 --> 00:25:36.410\nthe fun little yellow dots, hm.\n\n520\n00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:42.540\nCome over into our Insert\n&gt; Illustrations &gt; Shapes.\n\n521\n00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:44.144\nLet's start with a smiley face.\n\n522\n00:25:44.144 --> 00:25:46.690\nClick, hold and drag and here's my smiley.\n\n523\n00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:50.730\nAnd there's this yellow dot\nthat's in the middle right there,\n\n524\n00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:53.650\nand you see it right there, okay?\n\n525\n00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:57.290\nWhat that does is it will take it and\nI can make it a frown.\n\n526\n00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:02.410\nSo what it does is it actually\nmodifies the shape of everything.\n\n527\n00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:08.713\nSo let's go over to another one,\nwe will do the starburst.\n\n528\n00:26:08.713 --> 00:26:10.210\nYeah, we'll take this one.\n\n529\n00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:15.225\nClick, hold, and drag, and\nnotice if I take this yellow dot and\n\n530\n00:26:15.225 --> 00:26:20.315\nmove it in, see now it's actually\nmaking the rays of the star thinner.\n\n531\n00:26:20.315 --> 00:26:20.945\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n532\n00:26:20.945 --> 00:26:22.190\n&gt;&gt; And more pointy.\n\n533\n00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:26.968\n[LAUGH] And if I take it out, the it's\ngonna go ahead and make it not so defined.\n\n534\n00:26:26.968 --> 00:26:28.400\nYou see what it's doing.\n\n535\n00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.725\n&gt;&gt; It's after Thanksgiving dinner.\n\n536\n00:26:29.725 --> 00:26:32.356\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right like here we go.\n\n537\n00:26:32.356 --> 00:26:36.240\nSo some of your shapes have yellow dots.\n\n538\n00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:40.490\nI got distracted and I remembered nope,\nlightning doesn't have the yellow dot.\n\n539\n00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:43.147\n&gt;&gt; And now it's more like\na Salvador Dali painting [LAUGH]\n\n540\n00:26:43.147 --> 00:26:44.128\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah so,\n\n541\n00:26:44.128 --> 00:26:45.751\nsome of your shapes will have it.\n\n542\n00:26:45.751 --> 00:26:51.589\nAnother one that you can see the yellow\ndots a lot is this particular shape,\n\n543\n00:26:51.589 --> 00:26:53.172\nour rounded arrow.\n\n544\n00:26:53.172 --> 00:26:57.320\nSee, there's all sorts of yellow dots\nin here, to where it will take and\n\n545\n00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.006\nmake like the hump-\n&gt;&gt; Like rounding?\n\n546\n00:26:59.006 --> 00:27:01.115\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you can take that and\nmake it either-\n\n547\n00:27:01.115 --> 00:27:02.006\n&gt;&gt; More angular?\n\n548\n00:27:02.006 --> 00:27:05.552\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that, [LAUGH] I'm glad,\nyou're doing really good.\n\n549\n00:27:05.552 --> 00:27:07.791\n&gt;&gt; We do great at Password,\nI think [LAUGH]\n\n550\n00:27:07.791 --> 00:27:10.369\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, what am I trying to say,\n\n551\n00:27:10.369 --> 00:27:12.720\nDaniel will say it for me.\n\n552\n00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:17.130\nAnd you can change the arrow,\nhow big the arrowhead is and\n\n553\n00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:20.900\nhow wide this goes and\nall that kind of fun stuff.\n\n554\n00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:24.380\nSo if you see yellow dots,\njust start grabbing and moving around and\n\n555\n00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:27.120\nthen you can see how\nyour shapes will change.\n\n556\n00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.540\nSo those can be a lot of fun.\n\n557\n00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:34.030\nAnd one last thing cuz I wanted to kind\nof come back to it with a gradient.\n\n558\n00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:39.030\nIf I came into the Fill and\nchose that Gradient here, when you go\n\n559\n00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:45.240\ndown here, at the presets, behind my head,\nyou can see that the direction.\n\n560\n00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:47.740\nThis is where you can get\ninto your linear directions.\n\n561\n00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:50.175\nAnd the one that's kinda fun\nis if you choose the path.\n\n562\n00:27:50.175 --> 00:27:55.375\nSee how the gradient's gonna actually\nfollow the shape or the path right there.\n\n563\n00:27:55.375 --> 00:28:00.130\nAnd so my gradient is actually going\nto be in the shape of the star,\n\n564\n00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:04.650\nrather than just the circular or\nthe linear or the radial.\n\n565\n00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:07.650\nSo that one's a lot of fun\nthat I wanted to show you,\n\n566\n00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:12.813\ncuz that's just a really pretty\nrainbowy star, like unicorns.\n\n567\n00:28:12.813 --> 00:28:14.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You had to have the stars, and\n\n568\n00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:16.630\nthe rainbows all around, so there we go.\n\n569\n00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:20.020\nAnd I believe that is all that I wanted\nto cover in this particular episode.\n\n570\n00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:23.310\nWe'll have another one where we're going\nto be talking about multiple shapes and\n\n571\n00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:25.550\nhow we can group them and align them.\n\n572\n00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:27.516\nAnd I think we're gonna make a cat.\n\n573\n00:28:27.516 --> 00:28:30.350\n&gt;&gt; How did we not see that coming, right?\n\n574\n00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:33.830\nWell, Vonne, it has been tons\nof fun to create shapes and\n\n575\n00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:36.170\nadd them into our Excel worksheets.\n\n576\n00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:37.830\nIt's been a lot of good times here.\n\n577\n00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:40.660\nI look forward to seeing what else\nwe can do with them as we move\n\n578\n00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:41.670\nforward in our series.\n\n579\n00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:43.240\nBut guess what?\n\n580\n00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.580\nWe've run out of time for this episode.\n\n581\n00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:46.910\nWe do thank you good folks out there for\nwatching.\n\n582\n00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:49.860\nSigning off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n583\n00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:50.760\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n584\n00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.755\n&gt;&gt; We'll see ya next time.\n\n585\n00:28:52.755 --> 00:28:57.631\n[NOISE]\n\n",

another great\nepisode of OfficePro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.661 --> 00:00:13.767\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode, well,\n\n5\n00:00:13.767 --> 00:00:17.160\nif you were here for more Excel,\nthen you've come to the right place,\n\n6\n00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.997\ncuz that's our series today,\nExcel 2016 Advanced.\n\n7\n00:00:19.997 --> 00:00:23.740\nYou guys already know a little bit about\nit, so we want to increase that knowledge.\n\n8\n00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.686\nHere to help us do that very\nfeat is our good friend, Ms.\n\n9\n00:00:26.686 --> 00:00:29.834\nVonne Smith, Vonne, we're so\nglad to have you yet again.\n\n10\n00:00:29.834 --> 00:00:32.257\nAlways a pleasure in the studio to\nbe with you, how is it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:32.257 --> 00:00:34.593\n&gt;&gt; Why, thank you,\nit's wonderful to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:34.593 --> 00:00:37.620\nWe're going to continue\non talking about shapes.\n\n13\n00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.362\nSo we had our first episode,\nwe were adding and formatting them.\n\n14\n00:00:41.362 --> 00:00:45.470\nSo this isn't a part two, cuz I try to\nname them a little bit differently,\n\n15\n00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.317\ncuz this is specifically working\nwith multiple shapes and icons, so\n\n16\n00:00:49.317 --> 00:00:51.792\nwe're gonna draw a little cat, all right?\n\n17\n00:00:51.792 --> 00:00:55.022\nWe're gonna make a little kitty cat, or\nif you think about it, what's a cat?\n\n18\n00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:58.414\nIt's a circle, ears like-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a couple of triangles and\n\n19\n00:00:58.414 --> 00:01:00.010\nmaybe another little circle.\n\n20\n00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.679\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, put a little nose, right?\n\n21\n00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:05.256\nMaybe a little mouth that\nkinda goes like this.\n\n22\n00:01:05.256 --> 00:01:07.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, little half-circles,\nmake some circles and cut them in half.\n\n23\n00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:08.867\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthen we're gonna group them all together.\n\n24\n00:01:08.867 --> 00:01:09.880\n&gt;&gt; This sounds fun.\n\n25\n00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.624\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; We're going to draw with Excel.\n\n26\n00:01:11.624 --> 00:01:14.099\n&gt;&gt; I know, [LAUGH], here we go, right?\n\n27\n00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:15.313\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's like,\n\n28\n00:01:15.313 --> 00:01:17.478\nI think the concept of why we're\nusing Excel is lost on me.\n\n29\n00:01:17.478 --> 00:01:19.268\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We're just going\n\n30\n00:01:19.268 --> 00:01:20.653\nto add graphical elements so.\n\n31\n00:01:20.653 --> 00:01:22.599\n&gt;&gt; Don't have Illustrator?\n\n32\n00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:23.373\nWho needs that?\n\n33\n00:01:23.373 --> 00:01:24.508\n&gt;&gt; Yeah!\nYou have Excel!\n\n34\n00:01:24.508 --> 00:01:25.363\n&gt;&gt; You have Office Suite, right?\n\n35\n00:01:25.363 --> 00:01:27.632\n&gt;&gt; Yes, they go hand in hand, [LAUGH].\n\n36\n00:01:27.632 --> 00:01:30.921\n&gt;&gt; And you forget the fact that you\nhave things like Word, and [LAUGH].\n\n37\n00:01:30.921 --> 00:01:31.813\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n38\n00:01:31.813 --> 00:01:35.584\n&gt;&gt; Probably something more suitable too,\nbut it's in there, they put it in there.\n\n39\n00:01:35.584 --> 00:01:36.670\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; If you need to know how to do it,\n\n40\n00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.370\nthat's why we're doing it today.\n\n41\n00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.560\n&gt;&gt; And we're exploring all the tools and\nall the capabilities,\n\n42\n00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.433\nbecause there are people out there that\nwill build an invitation in Excel.\n\n43\n00:01:44.433 --> 00:01:48.052\nI think I might make a maybe a little\nbonus episode of where we're gonna\n\n44\n00:01:48.052 --> 00:01:51.853\nactually create, I have an invitation,\nI just haven't actually gotten\n\n45\n00:01:51.853 --> 00:01:55.430\nonto that worksheet tab,\ninto this workbook that I have right here.\n\n46\n00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.630\nSo why don't we just go ahead and\nhop on down in here?\n\n47\n00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.763\nBecause we've been working on\nthis insert images worksheet and\n\n48\n00:02:00.763 --> 00:02:02.927\njust putting in the shapes and everything.\n\n49\n00:02:02.927 --> 00:02:05.741\nWe've put in the pictures of Fuegle and\nBishop,\n\n50\n00:02:05.741 --> 00:02:10.482\nand we did all of our effects and strokes,\nI keep saying strokes, my goodness!\n\n51\n00:02:10.482 --> 00:02:14.337\nIt's an outline, [LAUGH], so\nwe have all those different things.\n\n52\n00:02:14.337 --> 00:02:17.365\nSo we'll come over here since\nthere is an invitation.\n\n53\n00:02:17.365 --> 00:02:19.461\n&gt;&gt; There is one right there.\n\n54\n00:02:19.461 --> 00:02:22.251\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There is, but for now we're going to go\n\n55\n00:02:22.251 --> 00:02:25.844\nahead and concentrate, this is something\nelse that we'll be getting to,\n\n56\n00:02:25.844 --> 00:02:27.510\non working with multiple shapes.\n\n57\n00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.347\nSo how do I create, say, a duplicate\nof my shapes, how do I rotate them?\n\n58\n00:02:33.347 --> 00:02:37.036\nWe did a little rotation of the other one,\nbut then we're going to flip them, and\n\n59\n00:02:37.036 --> 00:02:39.746\nthen we're going to align them,\nand then keep on going, so\n\n60\n00:02:39.746 --> 00:02:41.668\nwhy don't we draw our cat's ears first?\n\n61\n00:02:41.668 --> 00:02:45.179\nSo we'll come into our Insert\nIllustrations and Shapes, and Danny,\n\n62\n00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:48.525\nyou had said, well, we should do\na triangle for the ears, right?\n\n63\n00:02:48.525 --> 00:02:52.242\nSo we'll go with our basic triangle\nright here, our isosceles triangle,\n\n64\n00:02:52.242 --> 00:02:55.724\nand it doesn't matter, cuz we're\ngonna drag whichever way we want.\n\n65\n00:02:55.724 --> 00:02:58.931\nSo I'll click, hold, and\ndrag, and then we'll make it,\n\n66\n00:02:58.931 --> 00:03:01.314\nyeah, about like that, that sounds good.\n\n67\n00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:04.913\nBut I can always come in here and\nmaybe make it a little wider and so on and\n\n68\n00:03:04.913 --> 00:03:05.464\nso forth.\n\n69\n00:03:05.464 --> 00:03:10.679\nSo that looks like a nice little ear\nright there, I need to rotate this, okay?\n\n70\n00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:14.994\nSo we're gonna kinda turn it around\nlike that, so you can kind of already\n\n71\n00:03:14.994 --> 00:03:19.115\nthink about that this is going to be\nthe left ear, or at least my left.\n\n72\n00:03:19.115 --> 00:03:23.743\nSo now I need another one, now,\ncopy and paste, totally fine,\n\n73\n00:03:23.743 --> 00:03:28.461\nnothing wrong with a little Ctrl+C,\nCtrl+V, that's great,\n\n74\n00:03:28.461 --> 00:03:32.525\nbecause I do want it to be\nthe exact same size of this ear.\n\n75\n00:03:32.525 --> 00:03:37.641\nSo you could do that, or you could\ndo a little trick that while moving,\n\n76\n00:03:37.641 --> 00:03:39.910\nif you hold your Ctrl key.\n\n77\n00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.338\nWe've actually done this on a couple\nother examples when we were, excuse me,\n\n78\n00:03:44.338 --> 00:03:45.557\nduplicating cells.\n\n79\n00:03:45.557 --> 00:03:48.866\nWe had it selected and then we did the\nmove tool and then we hold the Ctrl key\n\n80\n00:03:48.866 --> 00:03:52.566\nand then we went ahead and duplicated our\ncell, so same thing with your objects.\n\n81\n00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:54.009\nHold that Ctrl key, and\n\n82\n00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:58.711\nyou can actually see your arrow turns into\na white arrow with a plus sign on it.\n\n83\n00:03:58.711 --> 00:04:03.100\nClick, hold, drag across, let go of the\nmouse first before you let go of the Ctrl,\n\n84\n00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.190\nand now I have an ear, okay, perfect.\n\n85\n00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.599\nNow, I really want this to be rotated\nthe same degree but the other side,\n\n86\n00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.871\nso I could grab here and turn it,\nbut I want it to be exact.\n\n87\n00:04:14.871 --> 00:04:19.421\nSo there is something up on our format\ncontextual tab over here on rotate where\n\n88\n00:04:19.421 --> 00:04:20.829\nit is flip horizontal.\n\n89\n00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.404\nSo I basically just wanna turn it over and\n\n90\n00:04:23.404 --> 00:04:26.297\nthat would be the exact\nsame ear duplicated.\n\n91\n00:04:26.297 --> 00:04:27.970\n&gt;&gt; On the other side.\n\n92\n00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.745\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we're going to horizontally\nflip this and then move that over,\n\n93\n00:04:30.745 --> 00:04:31.432\nokay, perfect.\n\n94\n00:04:31.432 --> 00:04:37.295\nNow, I want to have these ears be equal,\naligned up at their tops,\n\n95\n00:04:37.295 --> 00:04:41.613\nso we're going to go\nthrough our align options.\n\n96\n00:04:41.613 --> 00:04:45.620\nBut before we go with our align options,\nyou're gonna need to be able to select\n\n97\n00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.037\nboth the things that you want to\nhave aligned, so how do we do that?\n\n98\n00:04:49.037 --> 00:04:53.330\nYou hold your Shift key, if you hold your\nShift key, you can select multiple items.\n\n99\n00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.842\nAnd if I had four or\nfive things that I needed to align across,\n\n100\n00:04:55.842 --> 00:04:58.517\nthen you just keep that Shift key down,\nclick, click, click.\n\n101\n00:04:58.517 --> 00:05:01.711\nMake sure you get the boxes around\neach one of them, and then let go of\n\n102\n00:05:01.711 --> 00:05:05.378\nyour mouse, and let go of the Shift key,\nand now what do I want to do with this?\n\n103\n00:05:05.378 --> 00:05:10.245\nAnd this could be for, not just aligning,\nmaybe I want both of these to be filled\n\n104\n00:05:10.245 --> 00:05:13.659\nin with yellow or orange,\nso it's not just alignment,\n\n105\n00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:18.693\nit's just I want this thing to be applied\nto multiple things, where are we going?\n\n106\n00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:23.211\nWe're going over here to Align, so\nin this way we want to go with Align Top.\n\n107\n00:05:23.211 --> 00:05:27.567\nNotice that you can see on the icons here,\nif you're doing tops, middle, bottoms,\n\n108\n00:05:27.567 --> 00:05:31.742\nthat's with things going across, if you\nhave things going this way then you would\n\n109\n00:05:31.742 --> 00:05:35.341\ngo left, center, or right, so\njust kind of watch in those pictures.\n\n110\n00:05:35.341 --> 00:05:40.397\nI will zoom back out, click on the aligned\ntops, and so now I know that those\n\n111\n00:05:40.397 --> 00:05:45.152\nare exactly at the top point,\nthey're together, they are aligned.\n\n112\n00:05:45.152 --> 00:05:48.727\nI should probably not say together,\ncuz that kind of lends us up to grouping,\n\n113\n00:05:48.727 --> 00:05:51.820\nwe are not there yet, all right,\nwhere are we going to go now?\n\n114\n00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.050\nWell, we need to make the cat face, so,\n\n115\n00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.658\nwe're going to come back over into Insert,\nand we will draw a circle.\n\n116\n00:06:00.658 --> 00:06:04.410\nGrab my circle, click, hold, and\ndrag, it doesn't have to be exact,\n\n117\n00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.620\nbecause we can always come back\nin once I've drawn the shape.\n\n118\n00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.700\nAnd then make this a little wider,\nmake this a little wider,\n\n119\n00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.620\nand that looks pretty good.\n\n120\n00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:14.146\n&gt;&gt; That does look pretty good.\n\n121\n00:06:14.146 --> 00:06:16.246\n[LAUGH] It's already very cat like.\n\n122\n00:06:16.246 --> 00:06:19.236\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like I've drawn\na couple of these before.\n\n123\n00:06:19.236 --> 00:06:22.473\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Vonne just sits at her desk drawing\n\n124\n00:06:22.473 --> 00:06:24.931\ncats all day, are you working, Vonne?\n\n125\n00:06:24.931 --> 00:06:25.757\nYeah, totally working.\n\n126\n00:06:25.757 --> 00:06:28.604\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I do sometimes wonder about that,\n\n127\n00:06:28.604 --> 00:06:32.665\nthere's people walking by and I am\ncreating fun things and rainbows, and.\n\n128\n00:06:32.665 --> 00:06:34.677\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is for the episode,\n\n129\n00:06:34.677 --> 00:06:35.714\nI promise, [LAUGH].\n\n130\n00:06:35.714 --> 00:06:39.510\nAll right, so that looks about good,\nokay, stop fidgeting, stop, there you go,\n\n131\n00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:40.215\nthat's good.\n\n132\n00:06:40.215 --> 00:06:45.823\n[LAUGH] So now I have the face of my cat,\nwe need some eyes, right?\n\n133\n00:06:45.823 --> 00:06:50.162\nSo why don't we come into here and we'll\ngo with another circle, we'll just click,\n\n134\n00:06:50.162 --> 00:06:51.079\nhold, and drag.\n\n135\n00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:56.803\nNow I'm going off to the side here, so\nI can kinda move this over into it, and\n\n136\n00:06:56.803 --> 00:07:03.162\nthen we'll change the fill right there,\nand then we will Ctrl+Drag on over there.\n\n137\n00:07:03.162 --> 00:07:06.576\nThe other thing that I can show,\nremember that the Shift key,\n\n138\n00:07:06.576 --> 00:07:08.358\nhere I'm gonna let go and undo.\n\n139\n00:07:08.358 --> 00:07:12.925\nThe Shift key, when we were dragging,\nor moving, or resizing our shape,\n\n140\n00:07:12.925 --> 00:07:16.120\nthe Shift key was to maintain proportions.\n\n141\n00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:20.024\nWell, the other thing that you can do,\nif you hold the Ctrl key and drag,\n\n142\n00:07:20.024 --> 00:07:21.630\nthis is just moving, right?\n\n143\n00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:25.833\nBut I want it to be on the same path,\nI want to keep it on the same level,\n\n144\n00:07:25.833 --> 00:07:29.622\nI want to keep it aligned,\nthat's what I'm trying to get at.\n\n145\n00:07:29.622 --> 00:07:34.251\nSo if you hold the Shift key while you're\ndragging, see, I'm trying to move my mouse\n\n146\n00:07:34.251 --> 00:07:38.450\nup or down, but it's not going up or\ndown, because I'm holding that Shift.\n\n147\n00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:40.838\nSo it's going to keep it\nin line with each other, so\n\n148\n00:07:40.838 --> 00:07:44.740\nthat's kind of another little fun trick,\nand we'll kind of move that over there.\n\n149\n00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.094\nWe'll keep the Shift key held\ndown while I'm moving it, so\n\n150\n00:07:48.094 --> 00:07:49.982\nI keep it on the same level, yay!\n\n151\n00:07:49.982 --> 00:07:52.920\nWhy don't we take this and\nCtrl+Drag one more time,\n\n152\n00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.152\nwe will then make this a little smaller.\n\n153\n00:07:55.152 --> 00:07:58.062\nWe're not getting too exact right now, but\n\n154\n00:07:58.062 --> 00:08:01.609\nwe will put that there We'll\nfill this in with black.\n\n155\n00:08:01.609 --> 00:08:04.810\nAnd I probably should have\ndone the one eyeball first.\n\n156\n00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:05.970\n&gt;&gt; And then copied it.\n\n157\n00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:09.913\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like selected both the pupil and\nthe eye together.\n\n158\n00:08:09.913 --> 00:08:10.746\n&gt;&gt; It's not too late.\n\n159\n00:08:10.746 --> 00:08:12.742\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, we'll keep on going.\n\n160\n00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:16.050\nWe'll just go ahead and Ctrl drag and\nhold that Shift key and\n\n161\n00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:17.780\nthen put it right about there.\n\n162\n00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:21.081\n&gt;&gt; And how he looks like he's looking at\nsomething in two different directions,\n\n163\n00:08:21.081 --> 00:08:21.939\nit's great [LAUGH].\n\n164\n00:08:21.939 --> 00:08:23.516\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\nthis one's a little off, so\n\n165\n00:08:23.516 --> 00:08:24.559\nmaybe-\n&gt;&gt; Cat [LAUGH].\n\n166\n00:08:24.559 --> 00:08:29.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well this is where\nyou can use your align.\n\n167\n00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:35.474\nSo I can just do my Shift click and select\nboth of those and then align the centers.\n\n168\n00:08:35.474 --> 00:08:40.096\nAnd so now I know that they're right\nin the center of those circles,\n\n169\n00:08:40.096 --> 00:08:41.290\nright in there.\n\n170\n00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:43.957\nSo he is kind of looking down like-\n&gt;&gt; He's looking down,\n\n171\n00:08:43.957 --> 00:08:45.550\nhe is looking at the mouse,\nit looks delicious.\n\n172\n00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:48.616\n&gt;&gt; He's probably looking at his food\nif it's fuego, it's like a mouse.\n\n173\n00:08:48.616 --> 00:08:49.574\n&gt;&gt; A mouse.\n\n174\n00:08:49.574 --> 00:08:51.060\n&gt;&gt; Too much, that's too much work.\n\n175\n00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:51.787\n&gt;&gt; My cat eats mice.\n\n176\n00:08:51.787 --> 00:08:52.952\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Bishop,\n\n177\n00:08:52.952 --> 00:08:55.510\nBishop is a-\n&gt;&gt; He's a hunter.\n\n178\n00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:56.480\n&gt;&gt; He's a hunter.\n\n179\n00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.370\n&gt;&gt; Jungle cat.\n&gt;&gt; Yes yes,\n\n180\n00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.620\nsome people have come like,\nhey got a bird.\n\n181\n00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:00.821\nI'm like, I'm sorry.\n\n182\n00:09:00.821 --> 00:09:02.114\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Kind of his nature.\n\n183\n00:09:02.114 --> 00:09:05.626\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, he is a cat and\nhe definitely likes to hunt.\n\n184\n00:09:05.626 --> 00:09:07.245\nFuego just looks at it like.\n\n185\n00:09:07.245 --> 00:09:09.360\nMm, I can't move that fast.\n\n186\n00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.898\n&gt;&gt; That mouse is way over there.\n\n187\n00:09:10.898 --> 00:09:13.166\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hey Bishop, you go get that.\n\n188\n00:09:13.166 --> 00:09:14.095\n&gt;&gt; It's three feet.\n\n189\n00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:17.219\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's far.\n\n190\n00:09:17.219 --> 00:09:19.454\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nwhy don't we come back and just finish.\n\n191\n00:09:19.454 --> 00:09:23.148\nI have to finish the cat, so we'll go\nover into maybe like a triangle for\n\n192\n00:09:23.148 --> 00:09:24.920\na nose, right.\n\n193\n00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's the wrong way, but\n\n194\n00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:27.220\nwe will flip it upside down.\n\n195\n00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:27.835\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, do the old rotation.\n\n196\n00:09:27.835 --> 00:09:33.593\n&gt;&gt; And maybe, well it's a triangle so\nI can just kind of move it this way.\n\n197\n00:09:33.593 --> 00:09:34.439\n&gt;&gt; It's getting crazy now.\n\n198\n00:09:34.439 --> 00:09:37.222\n&gt;&gt; Okay, there we go,\nthat's what I wanted.\n\n199\n00:09:37.222 --> 00:09:41.341\nAnd now I'll turn it this way and\nwe will make it, we'll make it mauve,\n\n200\n00:09:41.341 --> 00:09:42.585\nwe'll go with that.\n\n201\n00:09:42.585 --> 00:09:47.185\nOkay, now one thing I can tell you that\neverything that's going on right now has\n\n202\n00:09:47.185 --> 00:09:49.275\nan outline on it, you said right.\n\n203\n00:09:49.275 --> 00:09:51.085\n&gt;&gt; You did look at you.\n\n204\n00:09:51.085 --> 00:09:51.975\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Now you jinxed yourself.\n\n205\n00:09:51.975 --> 00:09:53.015\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n206\n00:09:53.015 --> 00:09:56.465\n&gt;&gt; So when I have the one shape selected,\n\n207\n00:09:56.465 --> 00:09:59.191\nI wanna take all the outlines off them.\n\n208\n00:09:59.191 --> 00:10:01.015\nYou can barely see it but\n\n209\n00:10:01.015 --> 00:10:05.310\nif you scroll in you see all of\nthose have like a blue outline.\n\n210\n00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:10.490\nNow once you have one shape selected, if I\nwanted all the other shapes, remember cuz\n\n211\n00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:14.870\nwe're not in the cells right now, we're\nkind of on this floating level on top.\n\n212\n00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:17.500\nSo if I have one selected and\nthen do CTL+A,\n\n213\n00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:23.160\nit's gonna select all of the objects,\nnot the cells or the content in there.\n\n214\n00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.080\nSo I'm selecting all of them, and\nit looks a little crazy right now.\n\n215\n00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:31.410\nThat I'm gonna come up to the outline and\nchoose no outline there, and click off.\n\n216\n00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:32.800\nIt just makes it a little cleaner.\n\n217\n00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:39.540\nYou don't really see the separation\nbetween the face and the ears.\n\n218\n00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.960\nAnd then the last thing we're gonna do,\n\n219\n00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.670\nwe're gonna come into a shape\nthat we haven't done before.\n\n220\n00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:45.420\nIt's the curve.\n\n221\n00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:46.710\nSo this is just a line.\n\n222\n00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:50.679\nSo we're not doing a closed shape,\nwe're gonna be doing an open shape.\n\n223\n00:10:50.679 --> 00:10:54.117\nBecause when you have the mouth it kind\nof comes down and goes out like that.\n\n224\n00:10:54.117 --> 00:10:58.549\nSo I'm gonna take this curve and,\nI'll zoom in a little bit so we can see,\n\n225\n00:10:58.549 --> 00:11:00.920\nmaybe just move down just a little bit.\n\n226\n00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.334\nAnd I'm gonna come here and\nI'm gonna make one click, and\n\n227\n00:11:04.334 --> 00:11:09.071\nthen I'm gonna make one more click about\nhere, and you see how when I start moving\n\n228\n00:11:09.071 --> 00:11:13.150\nmy mouse out it's actually\ncurving around and I'm clicking.\n\n229\n00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:14.730\nYou're not really seeing\nwhat I'm doing but\n\n230\n00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:17.970\nI'm clicking as I go to kind\nof make those points and\n\n231\n00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:21.520\nit's gonna curve in between each one\nof those points which is pretty fun.\n\n232\n00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:26.590\nNow when you get to that last one don't\nmove, okay, cuz it's keeping on going.\n\n233\n00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:29.950\nSo let me show you, it's like nope\nI don't want to do that, all right.\n\n234\n00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:34.640\nSo when you get to that last\npoint you want to hit the Esc key\n\n235\n00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:38.090\non your keyboard and\nthen it will complete that path.\n\n236\n00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:40.922\nLet me make this a little bit thicker so\nyou can see it.\n\n237\n00:11:40.922 --> 00:11:43.475\nSo now you see there's\nwhere that curve is.\n\n238\n00:11:43.475 --> 00:11:46.410\nIt's not like perfect,\nit looks more like drawn but\n\n239\n00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:50.090\nwhen you click move click click and\nit will curve around.\n\n240\n00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:53.790\nSo that's kind of fun and\nwe will keep that.\n\n241\n00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:56.450\nLet's do our Ctrl drag again.\n\n242\n00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:59.010\nBut now we just need to turn it around so\n\n243\n00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:03.770\nwe can rotate it, flip it horizontal,\nmaybe a move over.\n\n244\n00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:08.800\nI'm also using my arrow keys on my\nkeyboard to kind of move that way.\n\n245\n00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:14.550\nAnd then maybe Shift and an up\na little bit and over just a tiny bit.\n\n246\n00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:17.580\nAnd there we go, cute, yay [LAUGH].\n\n247\n00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.220\nSo now we've drawn the cat.\n\n248\n00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:21.400\nNow there's one thing\nthat's going on here,\n\n249\n00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:27.360\ndo you see how the nose is\nbehind the little mouth?\n\n250\n00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.460\nI want it kinda coming out of it.\n\n251\n00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.960\nThis is where I'm gonna\ntalk about stacking order.\n\n252\n00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:36.342\nNow I'm gonna jump over to this worksheet\nhere just to demonstrate the concept, and\n\n253\n00:12:36.342 --> 00:12:39.315\nthen we'll come back and\nput the nose on top of the mouth.\n\n254\n00:12:39.315 --> 00:12:44.078\nBecause the reason why the mouth was\non top of the nose is because of\n\n255\n00:12:44.078 --> 00:12:46.275\nthe order in which we drew it.\n\n256\n00:12:46.275 --> 00:12:50.330\nAnd if you think about, I drew this\nfirst and then this and then this and\n\n257\n00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:54.610\nthen this and then this, there is\nan order, a stacking, that happens, okay.\n\n258\n00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:56.960\nSo it just keeps on going up.\n\n259\n00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.266\nSo for example here I have,\n\n260\n00:12:58.266 --> 00:13:02.070\nthis is a square and\nthis is a circle and this is a triangle.\n\n261\n00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:08.954\nIf I move this square and I move it here\nyou see that it's going behind the circle.\n\n262\n00:13:08.954 --> 00:13:12.272\nIf I take the triangle and move it over,\n\n263\n00:13:12.272 --> 00:13:17.130\nit's moving in front of the square and\nthe circle.\n\n264\n00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.960\nSo it looks like that\nthe square is on the bottom,\n\n265\n00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:26.000\nthe circle's in the middle, and\nthe triangle is on the top.\n\n266\n00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.480\nThis is where you can start moving things,\nyou can either send to back or\n\n267\n00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:36.500\nsend backward, or the reverse,\nyou can bring to front or bring frontward.\n\n268\n00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.080\nIf I took this square, and\nI'll put it right here.\n\n269\n00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:44.678\nIf I took this square and moved it\nforward, that's just gonna be one step up.\n\n270\n00:13:44.678 --> 00:13:45.575\nLet me show you.\n\n271\n00:13:45.575 --> 00:13:50.710\nCome up to Format, we bring to forward,\nbring forward and there it goes.\n\n272\n00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:57.060\nSee it's not all the way in front of\nthe triangle, it's in front of the circle.\n\n273\n00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:01.650\nIf I had said bring to front, okay so\nlet's undo, and I will bring this to\n\n274\n00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:07.550\nfront, there's a drop down bring to front,\nnow it goes all the way to the front.\n\n275\n00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:08.990\nSo that's where we have.\n\n276\n00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:12.860\nNow the cool thing that you have in your\nOffice products now is you have something\n\n277\n00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.320\nknown as the selection pane.\n\n278\n00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.030\nI really like this.\n\n279\n00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:19.390\nThis also reminds me of a Photoshop\nwhere I can see the layers and\n\n280\n00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:24.200\nwhere everything's at and where I\ncan use to select different things.\n\n281\n00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.664\nIf I click on it it brings\nit over to the right and\n\n282\n00:14:26.664 --> 00:14:31.109\nthere's nothing really below me and so\nwe're good, this all you guys need to see.\n\n283\n00:14:31.109 --> 00:14:35.280\nYou see I have a rectangle and\na triangle and an oval.\n\n284\n00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:37.680\nWell why do you think they\ncall us selection pane?\n\n285\n00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.470\nBecause you can use this to select things.\n\n286\n00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:44.180\nIf I click on the oval, notice that's\nthe thing that becomes the selected item.\n\n287\n00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:47.110\nIf I click on the triangle,\nthen that becomes a selected item.\n\n288\n00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:49.770\nThe other thing you have is these\nlittle eyeballs right here.\n\n289\n00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:53.260\nAnd there's a lot of times that I'll be\nin, maybe, PowerPoint or something, and\n\n290\n00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:54.750\nthere's a lot of graphical\nelements on there.\n\n291\n00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:59.140\nAnd I don't know which one is which,\nand I just start clicking those little\n\n292\n00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:01.310\neyeballs to turn them on and\nturn them off.\n\n293\n00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:05.100\nSo I can say, that was the thing\nthat turned off, that's a rectangle.\n\n294\n00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:08.170\nCuz a lot of times it might\njust say a bunch of numbers or\n\n295\n00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:13.000\nsomething that's not as definitive\nas rectangle, triangle, oval,\n\n296\n00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.970\nso I wanna rename it or see what that is.\n\n297\n00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:17.510\nTurn the eyeballs on and off.\n\n298\n00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:18.510\nOkay, that's what that is.\n\n299\n00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:21.950\nAnd then double clicking on that name\n\n300\n00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:25.980\nwill allow me to change\nthe actual name of that element.\n\n301\n00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:31.340\nSo it has multiple purposes beside just,\nand I should hit Enter to accept that,\n\n302\n00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:35.343\nbesides just selection the show and\nhide of your elements.\n\n303\n00:15:35.343 --> 00:15:37.687\nAnd then the other thing you can do\nis you can actually use this for\n\n304\n00:15:37.687 --> 00:15:38.990\nyour stacking order.\n\n305\n00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:43.040\nIf I wanted the circle,\nthe oval, to be in the front,\n\n306\n00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.370\nnotice like it's the last in the list.\n\n307\n00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:49.320\nYou can click Hold and\ndrag up watching those lines let go and\n\n308\n00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.174\nthen that can change your stacking order.\n\n309\n00:15:52.174 --> 00:15:56.594\nSo that way, I don't know, should I\nbring it forward twice or one forward or\n\n310\n00:15:56.594 --> 00:15:57.778\nwhere am I gonna go?\n\n311\n00:15:57.778 --> 00:16:02.494\nThis selection pane tells you exactly\nwhere Everything is in the relationship of\n\n312\n00:16:02.494 --> 00:16:04.445\nhow it was added to the document.\n\n313\n00:16:04.445 --> 00:16:06.450\nSo this is really, really handy.\n\n314\n00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:09.495\nAnd I'm glad they created\nthis a while ago.\n\n315\n00:16:09.495 --> 00:16:15.220\nBut this wasn't always here in your older\nversions of any of your Office products.\n\n316\n00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:16.450\nSo again, good job Microsoft.\n\n317\n00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:18.530\nSo I can move this around.\n\n318\n00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:22.740\nAnd now, I wanna make sure that all\nthree of these elements are like\n\n319\n00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.190\ncompletely aligned.\n\n320\n00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:29.140\nSo, or we can go ahead and use our\nselection panel over here to hold that\n\n321\n00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:34.660\nShift key and we can click to\nwhere I can select multiple items.\n\n322\n00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:35.280\nAnd you know what?\n\n323\n00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.845\nThat's it there, no.\n\n324\n00:16:36.845 --> 00:16:38.356\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know what?\n\n325\n00:16:38.356 --> 00:16:42.110\nOkay, we'll come over here, [LAUGH] and\nwe will do our Shift+click over there.\n\n326\n00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:45.490\nI thought it would do it,\nmaybe I wasn't clicking directly on it.\n\n327\n00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:47.180\nBut that's all right,\nwe've always got a backup.\n\n328\n00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:49.171\n&gt;&gt; That's right. [CROSSTALK] &gt;&gt; So\nI select the elements,\n\n329\n00:16:49.171 --> 00:16:53.885\nand now I can take my aligns to where\nif I align it the centers this way, and\n\n330\n00:16:53.885 --> 00:16:58.080\nthen aligned, the centers this way,\nnow I've got it perfect.\n\n331\n00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:02.240\nBut since this is a triangle, you probably\nkind of need to eyeball this a little bit,\n\n332\n00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.670\nand move this up, you know what?\n\n333\n00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:05.753\nI can align the bottoms, there we go.\n\n334\n00:17:05.753 --> 00:17:10.271\nWe could take and Shift+click and\nalign the bottoms.\n\n335\n00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:13.460\nThere we go, perfect.\n\n336\n00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:14.988\nNow all of this working together,\n\n337\n00:17:14.988 --> 00:17:17.839\nI don't wanna have to Shift+click\nto select each one of those.\n\n338\n00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:20.600\nAnd this is coming back to the cat,\nso we'll finish this up.\n\n339\n00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:23.760\nGrouping elements.\n\n340\n00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.309\nYou need to select multiples first.\n\n341\n00:17:25.309 --> 00:17:28.439\nSo I'm gonna hold my Shift key and\nselect these three items.\n\n342\n00:17:28.439 --> 00:17:32.150\nI want them all to act as one, so\nI can just grab it and move it around.\n\n343\n00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:37.710\nSelect it, you come over here to group,\nand we can take our group there.\n\n344\n00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:39.000\nAnd now it works.\n\n345\n00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.584\nThis is another reason why the selection\npane is really handy because if I was\n\n346\n00:17:43.584 --> 00:17:48.110\nhere, maybe I thought that was just\nlike a picture or some type of graphic.\n\n347\n00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:52.602\nBut there was actually three\nindependent shapes working together or\n\n348\n00:17:52.602 --> 00:17:56.714\ngrouped together and\nthat tells you right there, group four.\n\n349\n00:17:56.714 --> 00:17:57.890\nJust one of the many signs.\n\n350\n00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:02.330\nSo that way I know, okay, there's\nthat group I can use it to select it.\n\n351\n00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:06.951\nBut maybe I really wanna change\nthe color of just that circle.\n\n352\n00:18:06.951 --> 00:18:11.478\nInstead of having to ungroup it,\ndeselect, click on the circle, change it,\n\n353\n00:18:11.478 --> 00:18:14.290\nselect them all again and\nthen group them again,\n\n354\n00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:17.460\nI can use this to isolate\npieces of the group.\n\n355\n00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:21.205\nAnd then I'm only selected on the oval,\nwhoops too much.\n\n356\n00:18:21.205 --> 00:18:26.118\n[LAUGH] And\nthen we will change the fill color, here,\n\n357\n00:18:26.118 --> 00:18:29.588\nto okay, that's much easier.\n\n358\n00:18:29.588 --> 00:18:32.238\nNow you don't have to use\na selection pane to do this.\n\n359\n00:18:32.238 --> 00:18:36.309\nSo let me show you, if I click once,\nsingle click to select the group,\n\n360\n00:18:36.309 --> 00:18:38.620\nthen single click on that next shape.\n\n361\n00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:40.320\nThat is the isolation mode.\n\n362\n00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.480\nSo I don't want you to think that\nthat's the only way that you can get\n\n363\n00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:44.760\ninto the isolation.\n\n364\n00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.420\nAnd then I can come into here and make\nthis green and so on and so forth, okay.\n\n365\n00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.400\nSo that's where isolating parts of group.\n\n366\n00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.120\nMaybe you don't want it\nto be grouped anymore,\n\n367\n00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:56.779\nif you can group something\nyou can ungroup it.\n\n368\n00:18:56.779 --> 00:18:57.989\n[LAUGH] Dan is off camera\nhe just went like.\n\n369\n00:18:57.989 --> 00:18:58.881\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n370\n00:18:58.881 --> 00:18:59.696\n&gt;&gt; You're like yep.\n\n371\n00:18:59.696 --> 00:19:03.044\n&gt;&gt; You got one you gotta do the other\nright, for every black there is a white,\n\n372\n00:19:03.044 --> 00:19:04.779\nfor every yin there is a yang, right.\n\n373\n00:19:04.779 --> 00:19:06.394\n&gt;&gt; Couldn't say it better myself.\n\n374\n00:19:06.394 --> 00:19:08.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we've got that.\n\n375\n00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:11.230\nYou can also right-click on a lot\nof these things to get a lot\n\n376\n00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:15.160\nof the same options that we've been\ngetting in our format contextual tab.\n\n377\n00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:18.210\nSo I can come back to ungroup this.\n\n378\n00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:21.040\nNotice I now have all three\nof the items selected, and\n\n379\n00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:26.370\nthe selection pane tells me, and then I\ncan go ahead and move this however I want.\n\n380\n00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:28.123\nAll right, lovely-\n&gt;&gt; It's like a logo for\n\n381\n00:19:28.123 --> 00:19:29.746\na company from the 90s or something.\n\n382\n00:19:29.746 --> 00:19:30.566\n[LAUGH] Doesn't it?\n\n383\n00:19:30.566 --> 00:19:31.066\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n384\n00:19:31.066 --> 00:19:32.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we just need to go ahead and\n\n385\n00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:33.575\nput some text.\nYou know\n\n386\n00:19:33.575 --> 00:19:34.299\nwhat?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n387\n00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:36.192\n&gt;&gt; You just made me think about,\n\n388\n00:19:36.192 --> 00:19:39.901\nI don't wanna put it in the cells,\nI wanna keep the text for\n\n389\n00:19:39.901 --> 00:19:44.382\ntalking about making a logo here.\nI wanna put the text along the bottom\n\n390\n00:19:44.382 --> 00:19:47.990\nof Microchip Incorporated or\nsomething, right?\n\n391\n00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:50.780\nBut don't put it in the cells.\n\n392\n00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:53.828\nCome into insert,\ncuz you can go over here to text.\n\n393\n00:19:53.828 --> 00:19:59.414\nAnd when you go to insert text\nyou're creating a text box.\n\n394\n00:19:59.414 --> 00:20:00.223\nIt's that same level.\n\n395\n00:20:00.223 --> 00:20:01.785\n&gt;&gt; It's not a cell, right, yeah.\n\n396\n00:20:01.785 --> 00:20:05.385\nSo it's almost like an image or\na shape but you can put text inside of it.\n\n397\n00:20:05.385 --> 00:20:07.716\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\nNow I could have just as easily drawn\n\n398\n00:20:07.716 --> 00:20:08.595\na rectangle.\n\n399\n00:20:08.595 --> 00:20:09.605\n&gt;&gt;

There's a programming team at\nMicrosoft going, we get to do what?\n\n31\n00:01:09.593 --> 00:01:11.346\nAwesome [LAUGH].\n\n32\n00:01:11.346 --> 00:01:13.404\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat should be a lot of fun to create.\n\n33\n00:01:13.404 --> 00:01:15.855\nSo what are we gonna be\ntalking about in this episode?\n\n34\n00:01:15.855 --> 00:01:18.100\nWe're gonna be doing SmartArt.\n\n35\n00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.420\nWhat is SmartArt?\n\n36\n00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.477\nIt is art that is smart.\n\n37\n00:01:20.477 --> 00:01:22.991\n&gt;&gt; It has a high IQ [LAUGH].\n\n38\n00:01:22.991 --> 00:01:24.743\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, what it is,\n\n39\n00:01:24.743 --> 00:01:28.495\nit's a graphical representation\nof our information.\n\n40\n00:01:28.495 --> 00:01:30.800\nThat sounds so formal, really, [LAUGH].\n\n41\n00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.560\nBut it's really just a bunch of shapes,\nbut they're special shapes,\n\n42\n00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.110\nin a sense that you say,\nI wanna go ahead and insert this SmartArt.\n\n43\n00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.730\nYou pick from a gallery and\na library of different things, and\n\n44\n00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.800\nthen you go ahead and\njust fill in the little pieces.\n\n45\n00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.910\nIt's really great.\n\n46\n00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.240\nSo this is where it's kind of adding\na little more flair to maybe a list of\n\n47\n00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.190\ninformation.\n\n48\n00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.820\nInstead of just listing it out,\nyou can create it in some kind of graphic\n\n49\n00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.520\nrepresentation and be able to just\ngive it a little more pizzazz.\n\n50\n00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.323\nThis is another thing that would be\nreally good for organizational charts, or\n\n51\n00:02:01.323 --> 00:02:01.966\norg charts.\n\n52\n00:02:01.966 --> 00:02:06.202\nIf we have a company, who's at the top,\nand then who's the vice-presidents, and\n\n53\n00:02:06.202 --> 00:02:09.950\nthen who are the people underneath them,\nand so on and so forth.\n\n54\n00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.930\nUsing SmartArt to create a hierarchical\nrepresentation of that, it's really easy.\n\n55\n00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.380\nYou just go ahead and pick it and\nthen you start typing in the boxes.\n\n56\n00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.007\nSo we'll be going through a couple of\ndifferent examples within the SmartArt\n\n57\n00:02:22.007 --> 00:02:22.533\ngallery.\n\n58\n00:02:22.533 --> 00:02:25.570\nAnd it's kind of one of those\nlike once you've seen one,\n\n59\n00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.330\nyou can kind of get\nthe idea from the other.\n\n60\n00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.106\nSo I will show you how to add it within\nthe shapes and then add it to the list.\n\n61\n00:02:31.106 --> 00:02:32.400\nYou're like?\n\n62\n00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, let me show you.\n\n63\n00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.290\nSo we're back down in here\nin our graphics file.\n\n64\n00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.010\nI actually had closed everything out.\n\n65\n00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.986\nI didn't save the changes cuz we were,\n\n66\n00:02:41.986 --> 00:02:47.139\nI'm using the same file from\nthe adding shapes and then the images.\n\n67\n00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:49.431\nAnd it's really,\nyou could do the same thing,\n\n68\n00:02:49.431 --> 00:02:52.193\neverything in these episodes\nby just doing a File &gt; New.\n\n69\n00:02:52.193 --> 00:02:53.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you don't really have to have this\n\n70\n00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.820\nfile open.\n\n71\n00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.850\nI just like to attach\nsomething with a name to it.\n\n72\n00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.290\nSo where do we go to insert our SmartArt?\n\n73\n00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.760\nWe go to Insert, and\nwe're in Illustrations yet again.\n\n74\n00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.870\nAnd I come over to SmartArt, and\nit brings up the SmartArt gallery.\n\n75\n00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.830\nAnd so notice, you can see, over on the\nleft-hand side, you have your categories.\n\n76\n00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.500\nAnd then all the different\noptions in our categories.\n\n77\n00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.893\nAnd then on the right,\nit gives a little explanation over here.\n\n78\n00:03:19.893 --> 00:03:24.629\nUsed to show non-sequential or group\nblocks of information in our processes,\n\n79\n00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:28.940\nit shows like this sequential and\noverlapping steps in a process.\n\n80\n00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.550\nSo you could see if like, hey, if we're\ntrying to demonstrate a process or\n\n81\n00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.450\na workflow in our company,\nlike you must clock in first.\n\n82\n00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.630\nAnd then once you clock in,\nyou have to go eat breakfast.\n\n83\n00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.091\nWell, I should probably-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n84\n00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:44.003\n&gt;&gt; Eat breakfast.\n\n85\n00:03:44.003 --> 00:03:46.892\n&gt;&gt; I think bosses everywhere are like no,\nno, no, no, no.\n\n86\n00:03:46.892 --> 00:03:47.710\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, but\n\n87\n00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.930\nyou get the idea of like you\nmust do this then this and this.\n\n88\n00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.180\nInstead of just writing out step one,\nstep two, step three,\n\n89\n00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.690\nthis is just giving it\na little bit more pizzaz.\n\n90\n00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.110\nAnd to be able to demonstrate that\ninformation in a graphical form.\n\n91\n00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.522\nSo you can go through all the different\nones and see which one strikes your fancy.\n\n92\n00:04:05.522 --> 00:04:09.615\nWhether you're doing a cycle or\nyou're doing some type of hierarchy.\n\n93\n00:04:09.615 --> 00:04:11.783\nThat's what we're talking\nabout the org chart.\n\n94\n00:04:11.783 --> 00:04:15.165\nThe relationships between different items.\n\n95\n00:04:15.165 --> 00:04:17.714\nThat one looks kinda fun,\nlike [INAUDIBLE] confetti.\n\n96\n00:04:17.714 --> 00:04:19.193\n&gt;&gt; Like a solar system or something.\n\n97\n00:04:19.193 --> 00:04:22.691\n&gt;&gt; I say confetti,\nyou say solar system [LAUGH].\n\n98\n00:04:22.691 --> 00:04:24.608\nYou can definitely see\nthe difference right here.\n\n99\n00:04:24.608 --> 00:04:25.336\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n100\n00:04:25.336 --> 00:04:28.002\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nlet's go back over here to All.\n\n101\n00:04:28.002 --> 00:04:29.742\nAnd I'm gonna scroll up to the top.\n\n102\n00:04:29.742 --> 00:04:33.832\nWe're just gonna start with the basic one\nto get the idea about, let's go ahead and\n\n103\n00:04:33.832 --> 00:04:37.702\nformat our shapes, adding the text\ninto there and go from there.\n\n104\n00:04:37.702 --> 00:04:39.242\nSo let's click OK.\n\n105\n00:04:39.242 --> 00:04:40.912\nAnd I will zoom out just a little bit.\n\n106\n00:04:42.002 --> 00:04:44.012\nDon't worry about this thing\nover on the left-hand side for\n\n107\n00:04:44.012 --> 00:04:46.432\nright now cuz this is where your list is.\n\n108\n00:04:46.432 --> 00:04:50.137\nBut I do want you to see that bottom right\nthere, cuz I'm gonna collapse it down.\n\n109\n00:04:50.137 --> 00:04:55.160\nBecause you might not even have that\nbeing shown off to the side by default.\n\n110\n00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.170\nSo it might just show you the shapes,\nbut there is that button.\n\n111\n00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:04.029\nCuz these are the two ways that you can\ninsert the information into this graphical\n\n112\n00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:05.005\nobject.\n\n113\n00:05:05.005 --> 00:05:09.880\nIt's either in the list view or\njust typing directly into the shapes.\n\n114\n00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.160\nNow this is one unit of information.\n\n115\n00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.440\nSo notice there's a couple different like\n\n116\n00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.130\nbounding boxes that we had talked about\nin just adding shapes by themselves.\n\n117\n00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:27.330\nIt's almost like a special grouped items,\na grouped shapes in here.\n\n118\n00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.985\nThe outside box,\nif I get the two pointed arrows here,\n\n119\n00:05:30.985 --> 00:05:35.209\nI'm resizing the whole thing,\nall of the elements together.\n\n120\n00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:41.800\nRather than clicking on an individual box\nand then resizing the individual box.\n\n121\n00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.960\nNow notice how that,\n\n122\n00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.530\nnow we're just kind of making it\na little off kilter right here.\n\n123\n00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.170\nSo but you can do it, but I just want to\nillustrate the fact that you can resize\n\n124\n00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:56.810\nthings independently, or as the one\ngraphic cuz everything is together.\n\n125\n00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.915\nI'm gonna do a Ctrl+Z to undo there.\n\n126\n00:05:58.915 --> 00:06:02.710\nAnd where it says text,\nI wonder what that means?\n\n127\n00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.520\nYeah, you can add text.\n\n128\n00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You go ahead and\n\n129\n00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.130\nclick in there, and I can type in,\nwe're just gonna type in like one.\n\n130\n00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:11.320\nAnd then come over here, two.\n\n131\n00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.300\nAnd we'll type over here, three.\n\n132\n00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.340\nNotice though, when I typed in three,\nit made the word three,\n\n133\n00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.610\nis a little bit bigger, and it\nautomatically changed all the other ones.\n\n134\n00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:29.300\nSo if we say like another number here,\nsee it's trying to accommodate and\n\n135\n00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.942\nit is trying to keep it all-\n&gt;&gt; Consistent.\n\n136\n00:06:31.942 --> 00:06:34.110\n&gt;&gt; Yes, consistent, right,\nacross all of them.\n\n137\n00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.310\nSo if one gets bigger text and\n\n138\n00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.089\nthen it has to get a smaller font,\nall of the fonts change.\n\n139\n00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:40.000\nSo that's pretty cool.\n\n140\n00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.980\nThink about if I had made\nfour individual squares-\n\n141\n00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.843\n&gt;&gt; They don't want the other fonts to feel\n\n142\n00:06:43.843 --> 00:06:46.054\nbad because they are smaller\nthan the others.\n\n143\n00:06:46.054 --> 00:06:46.554\nThat's not nice.\n\n144\n00:06:46.554 --> 00:06:47.927\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, we're part of a group.\n\n145\n00:06:47.927 --> 00:06:49.237\n&gt;&gt; Equal font size for everyone.\n\n146\n00:06:49.237 --> 00:06:52.287\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we need to stay together, right?\n\n147\n00:06:52.287 --> 00:06:53.673\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Solidarity.\n\n148\n00:06:53.673 --> 00:06:55.495\n&gt;&gt; Yes, conform, conform!\n\n149\n00:06:55.495 --> 00:06:59.965\n[LAUGH] So now we have the text going\nahead and changing automatically,\n\n150\n00:06:59.965 --> 00:07:02.023\nwhich can be really nice for us.\n\n151\n00:07:02.023 --> 00:07:07.420\nAnd then I will go ahead and delete this\nout, and I'll just type in Four, for fun.\n\n152\n00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:11.800\nBut I only have four items,\nI don't need a fifth item.\n\n153\n00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.210\nSo you want to delete that shape,\nyou get to.\n\n154\n00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.570\nNow, you want to get to the four pointed\narrows, not the I-beam, cuz if you click\n\n155\n00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.490\non the I-beam, that's gonna go ahead and\nhave you type in the text.\n\n156\n00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:26.220\nI wanna get rid of this shape, so come to\nthe edge, with the four pointed arrow,\n\n157\n00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.540\nhave it selected, now you can go ahead and\nhit your Delete key.\n\n158\n00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.670\nAnd notice, cool, it's gonna go ahead and\n\n159\n00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:35.490\nreadjust everything within\nthat outside boundary.\n\n160\n00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:39.460\nSo this is where you can see it,\nit is like a special group.\n\n161\n00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:44.440\nThey work and act as one unit and\nwill go ahead and adjust for adding or\n\n162\n00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.040\nsubtracting shapes.\n\n163\n00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:51.420\nAdding more text or larger text, and then\ngo ahead and changing those font sizes.\n\n164\n00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.034\nSo it could be really nice.\n\n165\n00:07:53.034 --> 00:07:56.086\nAnd of course, just like with\nany of our graphical elements,\n\n166\n00:07:56.086 --> 00:07:58.973\nwe're going to get some\ncontextual tabs up on the ribbon.\n\n167\n00:07:58.973 --> 00:08:00.203\nWe have two of them here.\n\n168\n00:08:00.203 --> 00:08:05.157\nWe have a design tab and\nwe also have a format tab.\n\n169\n00:08:05.157 --> 00:08:10.980\nI usually just stick with the Design,\nand maybe a few things on the Format.\n\n170\n00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:11.606\nCuz to me,\n\n171\n00:08:11.606 --> 00:08:16.570\nI think the easiest way to use SmartArt\nis to pretty much just use the defaults.\n\n172\n00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:19.092\nInstead of trying to get in and\nreally format,\n\n173\n00:08:19.092 --> 00:08:21.870\nI want this one to be a different color\nthan that one, it's totally fine.\n\n174\n00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.713\nThere's nothing wrong with that.\n\n175\n00:08:23.713 --> 00:08:26.961\nBut if you just kind of stick with,\nwell, let's go ahead and\n\n176\n00:08:26.961 --> 00:08:28.272\ncome over here to Design.\n\n177\n00:08:28.272 --> 00:08:31.095\nLet's change the colors,\nwell let's make it colorful.\n\n178\n00:08:31.095 --> 00:08:33.646\nBoom, those colors look good together.\n\n179\n00:08:33.646 --> 00:08:36.850\nThere's a reason why you have themes.\n\n180\n00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:41.021\nWe keep coming back to this as a\nreoccurring them [LAUGH] to where whatever\n\n181\n00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:45.691\ndocument theme you have on it, those\nare the colors that you're picking from.\n\n182\n00:08:45.691 --> 00:08:49.551\nAnd just to remind you, remember that's\nover in the Page Layout tab, and\n\n183\n00:08:49.551 --> 00:08:50.868\nwe have our themes here.\n\n184\n00:08:50.868 --> 00:08:53.955\nAnd so that's where, using this gallery,\nthere's our pinks and\n\n185\n00:08:53.955 --> 00:08:55.028\npurples there Daniel.\n\n186\n00:08:55.028 --> 00:08:55.807\n&gt;&gt; There they are.\n\n187\n00:08:55.807 --> 00:08:57.990\n&gt;&gt; So\nwe're gonna change our themes now [LAUGH].\n\n188\n00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:02.040\nAnd that's what your colors are going\nto be based off of in your design.\n\n189\n00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:07.810\nAnd changing it to colorful or\nmore monochromatic and the different ones.\n\n190\n00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:11.780\nAnd to me, those look good together,\nso I'm just gonna keep it.\n\n191\n00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:12.690\nI'd rather have them\n\n192\n00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:14.730\ndo kinda the hard work of thinking about-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n193\n00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:16.907\n&gt;&gt; These colors look good together, so.\n\n194\n00:09:16.907 --> 00:09:18.731\nAnd then we can have\na couple styles to where,\n\n195\n00:09:18.731 --> 00:09:20.613\nhm, that makes it stand out a little bit.\n\n196\n00:09:20.613 --> 00:09:21.692\n&gt;&gt; Wow, that's kind of nice.\n\n197\n00:09:21.692 --> 00:09:23.781\n&gt;&gt; Right?\nAnd like, boom, there you go.\n\n198\n00:09:23.781 --> 00:09:28.895\nIn a quick couple seconds, adding our\ninformation, throwing on the colorful and\n\n199\n00:09:28.895 --> 00:09:32.317\na quick little style,\neverything looks really nice.\n\n200\n00:09:32.317 --> 00:09:35.614\nAnd so this is much more\npleasing to the eye, I would say,\n\n201\n00:09:35.614 --> 00:09:40.111\nto have it in four colored boxes,\nrather than just one, two, three, four.\n\n202\n00:09:40.111 --> 00:09:43.809\n&gt;&gt; Now, Vonne, what happens when I go\nberserk and jack this thing up completely,\n\n203\n00:09:43.809 --> 00:09:46.400\nand it just looks like a cat puked on it,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n204\n00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.093\n&gt;&gt; And I need to go back?\n\n205\n00:09:48.093 --> 00:09:50.081\nAnd I'm not talking\nabout just a quick undo,\n\n206\n00:09:50.081 --> 00:09:52.190\nlet's start from scratch kinda thing.\n\n207\n00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.574\n&gt;&gt;

She just can't spell,\napparently [LAUGH].\n\n368\n00:16:22.183 --> 00:16:23.494\n&gt;&gt; I did tell you that.\n\n369\n00:16:23.494 --> 00:16:24.584\n&gt;&gt; You forewarned us, Vonne.\n\n370\n00:16:24.584 --> 00:16:26.653\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So good to have a spell check on you,\n\n371\n00:16:26.653 --> 00:16:29.388\nbut then you can't really-\n&gt;&gt; Names aren't in spellcheck, yeah.\n\n372\n00:16:29.388 --> 00:16:30.835\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, I have you.\n\n373\n00:16:30.835 --> 00:16:31.907\n&gt;&gt; You do.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n374\n00:16:31.907 --> 00:16:34.524\nyou can see that we've done that.\n\n375\n00:16:34.524 --> 00:16:40.157\nAnd we can always take out and delete from\nour list level and that's a lot of fun.\n\n376\n00:16:40.157 --> 00:16:42.952\nI did want to go through and\nshow you the hierarchy,\n\n377\n00:16:42.952 --> 00:16:45.747\nthe ones where we're going\nto do like an org chart.\n\n378\n00:16:45.747 --> 00:16:49.560\nBecause that one is a little bit\ndifferent than just say, all right,\n\n379\n00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:53.534\njust change this list information,\nbecause you have a couple levels.\n\n380\n00:16:53.534 --> 00:16:57.321\nI'm going to add a new worksheet just for\nfun and I'll zoom out.\n\n381\n00:16:57.321 --> 00:17:02.065\nWe'll come back over into Insert,\nand we'll go into Illustrations and\n\n382\n00:17:02.065 --> 00:17:04.177\nwe'll come into our Smart Art.\n\n383\n00:17:04.177 --> 00:17:08.658\nWe'll go into our hierarchy and we'll\njust choose the first one and click OK.\n\n384\n00:17:08.658 --> 00:17:13.112\nSo we've got this element, I'm gonna make\nthis all a little bit bigger, and you can\n\n385\n00:17:13.112 --> 00:17:17.286\ndo it from the list level, but notice\nthere is this different character here.\n\n386\n00:17:17.286 --> 00:17:22.489\nThis is not a full Enter,\nit's a line break Enter,\n\n387\n00:17:22.489 --> 00:17:25.887\nand this is to show an assistant.\n\n388\n00:17:25.887 --> 00:17:27.999\nSo this would be like,\nokay, so who is the top?\n\n389\n00:17:27.999 --> 00:17:30.708\nI'm gonna go by the shapes and\nnot the text part, so\n\n390\n00:17:30.708 --> 00:17:32.729\nlet's talk about our organization.\n\n391\n00:17:32.729 --> 00:17:36.322\nSo we have our, not time,\n[LAUGH] we have our fearless leader.\n\n392\n00:17:36.322 --> 00:17:38.876\n&gt;&gt; Time controls us all, [LAUGH].\n\n393\n00:17:38.876 --> 00:17:42.772\n&gt;&gt; So Tim is going to be our main dude,\nhe's our top, and\n\n394\n00:17:42.772 --> 00:17:48.331\nthen the person that would be his\nassistant, well, that would be, Renee.\n\n395\n00:17:48.331 --> 00:17:54.506\nSo we have Renee here, and then from\nthere, then we go down to the next level,\n\n396\n00:17:54.506 --> 00:17:58.981\nso we have Angie, right,\nwho helps organize all of us.\n\n397\n00:17:58.981 --> 00:18:03.234\nAnd then we have Vivian, so she's on,\nI'm spelling that right, right?\n\n398\n00:18:03.234 --> 00:18:04.182\n&gt;&gt; She does marketing, right?\n\n399\n00:18:04.182 --> 00:18:07.014\n&gt;&gt; Yes, right, and we have some\nothers that go along the way, and\n\n400\n00:18:07.014 --> 00:18:10.117\nnot to exclude anybody else in our\norganization, but let's just say\n\n401\n00:18:10.117 --> 00:18:13.238\nthat those are the only people that\nwe have on this particular level.\n\n402\n00:18:13.238 --> 00:18:17.300\nSo we come over here, four pointed arrows,\nnot the eye beam, take this and\n\n403\n00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:20.602\nwe delete it, and see now how\nit goes ahead and adjusts that?\n\n404\n00:18:20.602 --> 00:18:24.440\nSo once I've got here,\nwell, now where do I go?\n\n405\n00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:29.246\nWell, if I'm on the Angie level,\nso I have this box selected,\n\n406\n00:18:29.246 --> 00:18:31.977\ncoming up here, we can add a shape.\n\n407\n00:18:31.977 --> 00:18:35.673\nBecause now we wanna go ahead and\nput all of the hosts, the edutainers,\n\n408\n00:18:35.673 --> 00:18:38.453\nunder this, so\nthere's a couple different levels.\n\n409\n00:18:38.453 --> 00:18:42.934\nNow if I did after, before, above, or\nbelow, and then show an assistant,\n\n410\n00:18:42.934 --> 00:18:48.059\nlet's see what it does after, you see,\nwell, that's on the same level, isn't it?\n\n411\n00:18:48.059 --> 00:18:51.333\nWell, that's not really what I wanna do,\nI want to take this person,\n\n412\n00:18:51.333 --> 00:18:54.898\nif you're thinking about in an\norganization, I wanna demote that person.\n\n413\n00:18:54.898 --> 00:18:58.087\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So if I demote it, there we go,\n\n414\n00:18:58.087 --> 00:19:02.437\nnow I've got it to where I've put\nthat person underneath, okay?\n\n415\n00:19:02.437 --> 00:19:06.501\nAnd now I could go ahead and type in\nDaniel, and then I can add a shape,\n\n416\n00:19:06.501 --> 00:19:10.233\nnow we're on the same level,\nso that's where it'll be okay.\n\n417\n00:19:10.233 --> 00:19:15.184\nJust knowing that sometimes when you add a\nshape, it might not be on the right level,\n\n418\n00:19:15.184 --> 00:19:18.562\nso that's where you know to promote or\ndemote somebody.\n\n419\n00:19:18.562 --> 00:19:21.098\nLike say here,\nmaybe I've got a promotion and\n\n420\n00:19:21.098 --> 00:19:25.465\nI'm going to promote myself and\nlook at there, now I'm on the same level.\n\n421\n00:19:25.465 --> 00:19:30.447\nSo we can go to those different places and\ngo ahead and adjust that.\n\n422\n00:19:30.447 --> 00:19:35.287\nSo you do need to think about where\nyou are when you're adding your\n\n423\n00:19:35.287 --> 00:19:36.792\ndifferent shapes.\n\n424\n00:19:36.792 --> 00:19:41.178\nSo I'm going to add somebody below, and\nthat's where's the next level, see,\n\n425\n00:19:41.178 --> 00:19:44.211\nthere you go, so\nI could have just added it right there,\n\n426\n00:19:44.211 --> 00:19:47.972\nI just wanted to demonstrate the whole\nafter that's the same level.\n\n427\n00:19:47.972 --> 00:19:52.954\nAnd then we have Erin, and\none more, we will add in Vikki,\n\n428\n00:19:52.954 --> 00:19:57.445\nso, which I think she's two k's,\nis she two k's?\n\n429\n00:19:57.445 --> 00:19:58.002\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n\n430\n00:19:58.002 --> 00:19:59.258\n&gt;&gt; I believe so.\n\n431\n00:19:59.258 --> 00:20:04.190\nNow the one thing in this particular org\nchart, do you see how both of the people\n\n432\n00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:07.956\nunder Angie and Vivian,\nthey're both going to the right?\n\n433\n00:20:07.956 --> 00:20:08.747\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n434\n00:20:08.747 --> 00:20:12.348\n&gt;&gt; But I just want it to\ngo to the other side, okay?\n\n435\n00:20:12.348 --> 00:20:15.741\nI want it to balance out, so-\n&gt;&gt; So it goes left on one side and\n\n436\n00:20:15.741 --> 00:20:17.054\nright on the right side.\n\n437\n00:20:17.054 --> 00:20:20.899\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this is where you have to\nthink about what level it's coming off of.\n\n438\n00:20:20.899 --> 00:20:25.215\nSo if I click on Angie,\nit's in the layout here, and\n\n439\n00:20:25.215 --> 00:20:30.132\nthis is where, how do these\nboxes hang off of the other box.\n\n440\n00:20:30.132 --> 00:20:33.641\nSo I can choose, let's take this and\ndo a left hanging, that makes it better.\n\n441\n00:20:33.641 --> 00:20:36.884\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So now the lines are kinda even,\n\n442\n00:20:36.884 --> 00:20:40.776\nyou can still go ahead and\nmove these guys over.\n\n443\n00:20:40.776 --> 00:20:44.628\nBut now you're starting to kinda mess with\nthat, and that's that whole thing going\n\n444\n00:20:44.628 --> 00:20:47.847\nback to, however they do it,\nhowever they build it, I kinda like it.\n\n445\n00:20:47.847 --> 00:20:51.764\n&gt;&gt; Like you said, let it do the heavy\nlifting for you, why reinvent the wheel?\n\n446\n00:20:51.764 --> 00:20:52.869\n&gt;&gt; Totally, yes.\n\n447\n00:20:52.869 --> 00:20:58.035\nSo then we throw a color, and\nwe throw a quick little 3D on that,\n\n448\n00:20:58.035 --> 00:21:01.108\nthat looks pretty cute, I like that.\n\n449\n00:21:01.108 --> 00:21:05.209\nAnd you can go through, and\nif I had the whole box selected,\n\n450\n00:21:05.209 --> 00:21:08.243\nif I wanted to change\nthe text color in here,\n\n451\n00:21:08.243 --> 00:21:13.099\nnotice I didn't have one box selected,\nI had the whole box selected.\n\n452\n00:21:13.099 --> 00:21:15.124\nIf I had just selected this one shape,\n\n453\n00:21:15.124 --> 00:21:17.856\nnow you can see that it's\nonly changing that once.\n\n454\n00:21:17.856 --> 00:21:22.396\nSo if you wanna do it, like a change for\nall of it, come all the way out here\n\n455\n00:21:22.396 --> 00:21:26.731\nto the four pointed arrows, and\nthen go ahead and change from there.\n\n456\n00:21:26.731 --> 00:21:30.349\nAnd of course, you're gonna always\ncome in and do some word art and\n\n457\n00:21:30.349 --> 00:21:32.363\nchange the little things like that.\n\n458\n00:21:32.363 --> 00:21:34.748\nOkay, now I'm starting to\nget a little crazy, hey,\n\n459\n00:21:34.748 --> 00:21:36.768\nremember that good old\nreset graphic there?\n\n460\n00:21:36.768 --> 00:21:37.725\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, ma'am.\n\n461\n00:21:37.725 --> 00:21:39.697\n&gt;&gt; That is a good thing to do,\n\n462\n00:21:39.697 --> 00:21:44.107\nnow I do want to go over this\nlast part of convert to shapes.\n\n463\n00:21:44.107 --> 00:21:48.304\nBecause there will be certain times where\nmaybe you don't want it to act like\n\n464\n00:21:48.304 --> 00:21:52.828\nSmart Art anymore, like I wanna take this,\ncuz there's some kind of fun things in\n\n465\n00:21:52.828 --> 00:21:55.911\nall these layouts that can\nreally change some stuff up,\n\n466\n00:21:55.911 --> 00:22:00.335\nit's like, I really like just the shapes\nabout that, I like those gears.\n\n467\n00:22:00.335 --> 00:22:03.532\nI wanna take, now,\nnotice how it changed this layout,\n\n468\n00:22:03.532 --> 00:22:07.287\nit doesn't really work with this\nfrom a hierarchy perspective.\n\n469\n00:22:07.287 --> 00:22:11.090\nSo if I just take all that out and\nthen just add a couple,\n\n470\n00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:15.159\nI think those are cool shapes\nto work with independently.\n\n471\n00:22:15.159 --> 00:22:19.577\nSo if you took this and\nthen went to your convert to shapes,\n\n472\n00:22:19.577 --> 00:22:23.814\nit's going to stop making it\nbe a Smart Art graphic, and\n\n473\n00:22:23.814 --> 00:22:28.797\nthen every shape is its own shape,\nso that can be kind of fun to do.\n\n474\n00:22:28.797 --> 00:22:32.853\nNow notice, when you convert it to shapes,\nit is grouped, so\n\n475\n00:22:32.853 --> 00:22:37.533\nif you right-click on this and\ngo to Ungroup, now this is one element,\n\n476\n00:22:37.533 --> 00:22:42.221\nthis is one element, and I could go\nahead and use this however I wanted.\n\n477\n00:22:42.221 --> 00:22:45.794\nSo sometimes using that Smart Art\ngraphic to get you started,\n\n478\n00:22:45.794 --> 00:22:48.623\nand them come into here,\nit could be kind of fun.\n\n479\n00:22:48.623 --> 00:22:52.874\nThere is another thing that we're going\nto be talking about later in this series\n\n480\n00:22:52.874 --> 00:22:55.993\nabout sharing,\nwhen we're collaborating with others.\n\n481\n00:22:55.993 --> 00:23:00.593\nAnd when you go into actually doing\na shared workbook there are a lot of\n\n482\n00:23:00.593 --> 00:23:04.808\nthings that you can't do or\nbe supported in a shared workbook.\n\n483\n00:23:04.808 --> 00:23:08.070\nI can't remember if Smart Art is one\nof those, but it's one of those,\n\n484\n00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:09.782\nif I didn't want it to act like that,\n\n485\n00:23:09.782 --> 00:23:13.070\nmaking it shapes might make it a little\nbit easier for certain things.\n\n486\n00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:16.135\nSo I know things like tables,\nremember doing format as tables?\n\n487\n00:23:16.135 --> 00:23:20.180\nYou can't do that in a shared workbook, so\nyou'd have to convert it to a range, so\n\n488\n00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:21.954\nat least you know that this exists.\n\n489\n00:23:21.954 --> 00:23:25.350\nStop acting like a Smart Art graphic and\njust be plain old shapes, so\n\n490\n00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:28.756\nthat's what that button can do for\nyou, and you might need to do it.\n\n491\n00:23:28.756 --> 00:23:33.249\nSo that, I believe, covers all the cool\nthings that Smart Art graphics can do for\n\n492\n00:23:33.249 --> 00:23:34.915\nus, it's art that is smart.\n\n493\n00:23:34.915 --> 00:23:36.416\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It is very, very smart art.\n\n494\n00:23:36.416 --> 00:23:40.043\nI love the way that it just starts\nresizing and removing itself so\n\n495\n00:23:40.043 --> 00:23:44.218\nthat it adjusts to what input you're\ngiving it, very, very cool stuff.\n\n496\n00:23:44.218 --> 00:23:48.398\nAnd like we've mentioned a couple of\ntimes, it's doing all the hard stuff so\n\n497\n00:23:48.398 --> 00:23:51.867\nthat when you want to make an overall\nchange to what's going on,\n\n498\n00:23:51.867 --> 00:23:55.852\nyou don't have to start moving things and\nredraw this and undo that,\n\n499\n00:23:55.852 --> 00:23:59.291\nit's too much work for us,\nSmart Art takes care of that for us.\n\n500\n00:23:59.291 --> 00:24:00.878\nVonne, a really cool way for\n\n501\n00:24:00.878 --> 00:24:05.510\nus to add another graphical element to our\nExcel spreadsheets or our worksheets and\n\n502\n00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:09.632\nworkbooks and all the other cool\nterminology used inside of Excel [LAUGH].\n\n503\n00:24:09.632 --> 00:24:10.683\n&gt;&gt;

That is true.\n\n68\n00:03:00.106 --> 00:03:02.625\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So I'm just actually\ngonna ignore that one right now and\n\n69\n00:03:02.625 --> 00:03:04.090\njust close the little guy out here.\n\n70\n00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.779\nSo I have this file, and this\nparticular piece of paper that I have,\n\n71\n00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:11.953\nwhich you don't necessarily need to\nsee exactly what it is, is right here.\n\n72\n00:03:11.953 --> 00:03:13.292\nThere's my invitation.\n\n73\n00:03:13.292 --> 00:03:14.660\nWe know how to insert an image.\n\n74\n00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.065\nWe went ahead and\nfound an online image, and\n\n75\n00:03:17.065 --> 00:03:19.608\nthis is just regular text\nthat I have typed in.\n\n76\n00:03:19.608 --> 00:03:22.817\nI've formatted it, and of course,\nyou've gotta do the Curlz MT,\n\n77\n00:03:22.817 --> 00:03:23.900\n[SOUND] love that font.\n\n78\n00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.015\n[LAUGH] So we've got our when, where, and\nthese are in the particular cells and\n\n79\n00:03:29.015 --> 00:03:31.819\nthen this is the next\ncell right next to it.\n\n80\n00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.855\nSo it's just like that\ngraph paper we were saying.\n\n81\n00:03:33.855 --> 00:03:38.332\nIt's like I wanna go ahead put one\nrow down, skip a row, skip a row,\n\n82\n00:03:38.332 --> 00:03:40.233\nskip a row, skip to the loo.\n\n83\n00:03:40.233 --> 00:03:42.144\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Something like that.\n\n84\n00:03:42.144 --> 00:03:45.429\nSo you can see that it's aligning\neverything pretty perfectly.\n\n85\n00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:50.587\nNow, how did I get it to exactly on this\npiece of paper almost like centered?\n\n86\n00:03:50.587 --> 00:03:51.890\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's the view.\n\n90\n00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.336\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The view.\n\n91\n00:03:59.336 --> 00:04:02.911\n&gt;&gt; And this is something that we talked\nabout in the Excel essentials show, where\n\n92\n00:04:02.911 --> 00:04:06.892\nI said, yeah this page layout, I don't\nusually go with that much, I don't use it.\n\n93\n00:04:06.892 --> 00:04:10.210\nWell, here's a place for\nI would totally use it, and I did.\n\n94\n00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:16.059\nIf I click on this, yeah, remember page\nlayout is where it shows it like Word,\n\n95\n00:04:16.059 --> 00:04:20.202\nwhere I can see each break and\nwhat page it's going to do.\n\n96\n00:04:20.202 --> 00:04:22.076\nSo I went ahead and\nthrew it in a page layout.\n\n97\n00:04:22.076 --> 00:04:24.638\nI put it back to normal for\nthe demonstration, and\n\n98\n00:04:24.638 --> 00:04:26.653\nthen I just kind of moved it all around.\n\n99\n00:04:26.653 --> 00:04:30.753\nI stayed out in this zoom level and\njust put the picture in,\n\n100\n00:04:30.753 --> 00:04:34.449\nmade it smaller, and\naligned it, and there you go.\n\n101\n00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:35.858\nI made an invitation,-\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n221\n00:10:04.609 --> 00:10:08.610\nyou have to kind of work with your\nprinter, and make, the physical printer,\n\n222\n00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:12.628\nnot the person, and then just make sure\nyou go ahead and get it just like that.\n\n223\n00:10:12.628 --> 00:10:14.334\nBut it's kind of fun.\n\n224\n00:10:14.334 --> 00:10:19.479\nHopefully, you're already seeing how you\ncan use Excel as that grid to go ahead and\n\n225\n00:10:19.479 --> 00:10:20.152\nalign it.\n\n226\n00:10:20.152 --> 00:10:22.838\nNow I wanted to take us one step\n[LAUGH] further, because why?\n\n227\n00:10:22.838 --> 00:10:23.710\nCuz I just wanted to.\n\n228\n00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:27.085\n&gt;&gt;

Like to where you take this and\nyou open it up.\n\n232\n00:10:36.277 --> 00:10:37.301\n&gt;&gt; Like a bi-folding.\n\n233\n00:10:37.301 --> 00:10:38.109\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like this.\n\n234\n00:10:38.109 --> 00:10:38.750\n&gt;&gt;

Yes.\n\n238\n00:10:44.447 --> 00:10:46.946\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It was, and you know our printer.\n\n239\n00:10:46.946 --> 00:10:50.740\nThis thing is like an older,\nit's a single little guy.\n\n240\n00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:53.084\nNothing is fancy about it.\n\n241\n00:10:53.084 --> 00:10:55.436\nWell I did this on our\nprinter this morning.\n\n242\n00:10:55.436 --> 00:10:56.428\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n243\n00:10:56.428 --> 00:10:59.730\n[LAUGH] let me show you how I did it,\nand little kind of tips and\n\n244\n00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:04.292\ntricks if you are going to be doing, this\nis first of all double-sided printing,\n\n245\n00:11:04.292 --> 00:11:08.521\nbut I then put the paper in first,\nprinted one, then printed the other one,\n\n246\n00:11:08.521 --> 00:11:12.156\nand I folded it down, and\nbecause I've done this a couple times,\n\n247\n00:11:12.156 --> 00:11:13.916\nit's not perfectly aligned.\n\n248\n00:11:13.916 --> 00:11:16.001\n&gt;&gt; How many times did you get it wrong?\n\n249\n00:11:16.001 --> 00:11:16.810\n&gt;&gt; Only twice.\n\n250\n00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:17.563\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well that's not bad.\n\n251\n00:11:17.563 --> 00:11:18.393\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n252\n00:11:18.393 --> 00:11:19.195\n&gt;&gt; That's not bad.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n253\n00:11:19.195 --> 00:11:21.937\nI also did it wrong on purpose to show it,\ncuz I have-\n\n254\n00:11:21.937 --> 00:11:23.585\n&gt;&gt; To show that it can go wrong easily.\n\n255\n00:11:23.585 --> 00:11:24.398\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this one.\n\n256\n00:11:24.398 --> 00:11:31.250\nOkay, cuz they're like okay this is\na cupcake, but then this is upside, wait.\n\n257\n00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:32.001\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n258\n00:11:32.001 --> 00:11:35.118\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a trick to-\n&gt;&gt; Orientation is very important in\n\n259\n00:11:35.118 --> 00:11:35.814\nprinting.\n\n260\n00:11:35.814 --> 00:11:41.410\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes and it's called impositioning,\nhow the images or the layouts are actually\n\n261\n00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:46.633\npositioned on the printed page for how\nit folds down into this perfect booklet.\n\n262\n00:11:46.633 --> 00:11:47.166\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n263\n00:11:47.166 --> 00:11:49.747\n&gt;&gt; So that's something that,\nas a print provider,\n\n264\n00:11:49.747 --> 00:11:54.111\nthey would do the impositioning for you,\nbut when you have to do own impositioning,\n\n265\n00:11:54.111 --> 00:11:55.359\nyou-\n&gt;&gt; You better dig in.\n\n266\n00:11:55.359 --> 00:11:56.151\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so let me show you.\n\n267\n00:11:56.151 --> 00:11:57.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let me give you some tricks.\n\n268\n00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:01.033\nSo here we have our inside paper.\n\n269\n00:12:01.033 --> 00:12:02.676\nSame thing we've been doing.\n\n270\n00:12:02.676 --> 00:12:07.734\nI went ahead and did the page layout, and\nnow this line, what is this line here?\n\n271\n00:12:07.734 --> 00:12:10.015\nIt's the fold line, cuz think about it.\n\n272\n00:12:10.015 --> 00:12:14.335\nIf I have this piece of paper,\nthis is an 8.5 by 11 paper.\n\n273\n00:12:14.335 --> 00:12:17.334\nThis is 11 inches across,\nright, so what's half of 11?\n\n274\n00:12:17.334 --> 00:12:19.691\n&gt;&gt; Half of 11 is like six.\n\n275\n00:12:19.691 --> 00:12:20.534\n&gt;&gt; Five and a half.\n&gt;&gt; Five and a half.\n\n276\n00:12:20.534 --> 00:12:21.688\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I've done this a lot.\n\n277\n00:12:21.688 --> 00:12:23.390\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not great at math.\n\n278\n00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:25.620\n&gt;&gt; That's also like okay, so\nthis is eight and a half.\n\n279\n00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:26.867\nWhat's half of eight and a half?\n\n280\n00:12:26.867 --> 00:12:28.550\n&gt;&gt; That's four and a quarter.\n\n281\n00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:31.451\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's where if you\nwere doing it folding it this way,\n\n282\n00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:36.616\nyou have to have some type of Point of-\n&gt;&gt; Center line, yeah.\n\n283\n00:12:36.616 --> 00:12:40.983\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, of where you need to know where\nthat is, and so this, this right here,\n\n284\n00:12:40.983 --> 00:12:42.273\nis just a single line.\n\n285\n00:12:42.273 --> 00:12:44.727\nI took a insert shape and drew a line,\n\n286\n00:12:44.727 --> 00:12:47.335\nand then I put it, if you look-\n&gt;&gt; There's\n\n287\n00:12:47.335 --> 00:12:48.266\na ruler-\n&gt;&gt; Yes there is.\n\n288\n00:12:48.266 --> 00:12:50.187\n&gt;&gt; On top of the screen there, cheater.\n\n289\n00:12:50.187 --> 00:12:52.724\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's part of the view,\n\n290\n00:12:52.724 --> 00:12:55.031\nthe Page Layout view is,\nit puts all of this on it.\n\n291\n00:12:55.031 --> 00:12:58.999\nIt has the ruler, has our grid lines,\nand so that, it's a little,\n\n292\n00:12:58.999 --> 00:13:01.030\nit's not exactly five and a half.\n\n293\n00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.447\nBut, that whole having to adjust for\nthe printer.\n\n294\n00:13:05.447 --> 00:13:08.944\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Like, I had to kind of move it around,\n\n295\n00:13:08.944 --> 00:13:14.362\nand on this fold of this one,\non the middle, it's almost dead on.\n\n296\n00:13:14.362 --> 00:13:16.242\nIt's not, on the outside,\n[SOUND] that's okay.\n\n297\n00:13:16.242 --> 00:13:16.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what are you gonna do?\n\n298\n00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.460\n&gt;&gt; Remember, we're making an invitation\nin Excel, on our printer at work.\n\n299\n00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:23.513\n&gt;&gt; You're handing it out to colleagues and\nthey're gonna go, awesome.\n\n300\n00:13:23.513 --> 00:13:24.774\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; See you there.\n\n301\n00:13:24.774 --> 00:13:27.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Thanks.\n\n302\n00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.567\n&gt;&gt; I worked really hard on that.\n\n303\n00:13:29.567 --> 00:13:31.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Slash you're tired.\n\n304\n00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.620\n&gt;&gt; And then you just sit there and\n\n305\n00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:33.778\nbe like,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n306\n00:13:33.778 --> 00:13:37.872\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so anyways,\n[LAUGH] we have here, that's the line.\n\n307\n00:13:37.872 --> 00:13:41.334\nI just drew that for\nus to know where it's at, and\n\n308\n00:13:41.334 --> 00:13:45.809\nyou can see that's where I also\nwanna kind of center everything\n\n309\n00:13:45.809 --> 00:13:50.030\nwithin that's gonna go on\nthe inside of that invitation.\n\n310\n00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:56.790\nSo you've gotta just design on\nthe second half Of our landscape paper.\n\n311\n00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:58.600\nNow, look at the front, okay?\n\n312\n00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.606\nLook at where it is.\n\n313\n00:14:00.606 --> 00:14:03.460\nWhy is that cupcake upside-down?\n\n314\n00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:07.572\nBecause that's the impositioning,\nbecause if I printed it at this way,\n\n315\n00:14:07.572 --> 00:14:09.970\nthat's the one where it's the wrong way.\n\n316\n00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:11.746\nIt's upside-down.\n\n317\n00:14:11.746 --> 00:14:13.360\n&gt;&gt; As you wrote on it, wrong way.\n\n318\n00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.005\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n319\n00:14:14.005 --> 00:14:16.031\nthis is the one where you're like,\nhow many times did you print it wrong?\n\n320\n00:14:16.031 --> 00:14:17.140\nI did it on purpose.\n\n321\n00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.965\nSo I got this part right,\nbut this part was wrong,\n\n322\n00:14:19.965 --> 00:14:23.476\ncuz you're thinking,\nI want it to look right-side up.\n\n323\n00:14:23.476 --> 00:14:29.500\nWhen you fold it on you have to\nmake sure that that is upside-down.\n\n324\n00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.160\nSo you take everything that you do,\nyou can go ahead and\n\n325\n00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:36.710\ndesign everything, do a select all,\nflip it upside down, remember the rotate?\n\n326\n00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:40.281\nRight, so if this was the wrong way,\nI can take this shape,\n\n327\n00:14:40.281 --> 00:14:44.567\nthis is another shape here, so\nI did a shift click, and then over here,\n\n328\n00:14:44.567 --> 00:14:47.639\nI would actually just take\nthis guy right here, and\n\n329\n00:14:47.639 --> 00:14:52.452\nI would just rotate that around and get it\nto where it goes right back up and down.\n\n330\n00:14:52.452 --> 00:14:53.523\nThat's what you need to do.\n\n331\n00:14:53.523 --> 00:14:57.906\nSo design everything first on\nthat second half of the page,\n\n332\n00:14:57.906 --> 00:15:02.039\nthe front, and then you flip it,\nand then you print it.\n\n333\n00:15:02.039 --> 00:15:04.252\nNow, [LAUGH] this is the funny\nthing about printing.\n\n334\n00:15:04.252 --> 00:15:08.123\nAll right, and when I'm doing\nimpositioning, even if I'm doing like a,\n\n335\n00:15:08.123 --> 00:15:11.194\nif you have a printer that can\ndo the whole double-sided and\n\n336\n00:15:11.194 --> 00:15:14.710\nthen staple down the middle,\ncuz some of the printers will do that.\n\n337\n00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:17.686\nI take pieces of paper,\nand I write, front, and\n\n338\n00:15:17.686 --> 00:15:21.969\nthen, one, two, three, four, so\nI know where my pages are to where I\n\n339\n00:15:21.969 --> 00:15:25.265\nknow how I'm going to need\nto staple it all together.\n\n340\n00:15:25.265 --> 00:15:26.806\nNow, a lot of those printers,\nit does it for you.\n\n341\n00:15:26.806 --> 00:15:27.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n342\n00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:33.110\n&gt;&gt; You do it, but see I said front, and\nthen inside, so I know where these are,\n\n343\n00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:38.810\nand I put like little up arrows, and then,\n[LAUGH] when you put it into the printer.\n\n344\n00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:44.583\nThat's where you have to know how\nyour paper get fed in to the printer.\n\n345\n00:15:44.583 --> 00:15:48.999\nSo I went to our printer,\nI took up a piece of paper, and\n\n346\n00:15:48.999 --> 00:15:53.897\nI wrote on it top, right here it says top,\nand then I have up.\n\n347\n00:15:53.897 --> 00:15:56.115\nTop is where I know it's up into-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n348\n00:15:56.115 --> 00:15:57.865\n&gt;&gt; The tray.\n&gt;&gt; That faces up?\n\n349\n00:15:57.865 --> 00:15:59.540\n&gt;&gt; Yes, this is my facing up.\n\n350\n00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:01.915\nThis is top to where it's\ngoing in the printer.\n\n351\n00:16:01.915 --> 00:16:03.940\nThis is bottom, this is the one facing me.\n\n352\n00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:07.374\nI put it there and then I print it out,\nthis first pict, so\n\n353\n00:16:07.374 --> 00:16:12.117\nI know where it came, and when it comes\nout of our printer, it was facing down.\n\n354\n00:16:12.117 --> 00:16:13.306\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you know we had to.\n\n355\n00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:18.102\nSo I was like okay, so\nif that's how it comes out,\n\n356\n00:16:18.102 --> 00:16:21.527\nwhat I need to do is then I need to load\n\n357\n00:16:21.527 --> 00:16:26.460\nthe same piece of paper into our tray,\nthis way up.\n\n358\n00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:28.340\nI don't even remember now.\n\n359\n00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.936\nBut, [LAUGH] basically I had to take\nit and then put the piece of paper,\n\n360\n00:16:31.936 --> 00:16:36.214\nknowing which is top, which is up, how\nit's going to come out of the printer, and\n\n361\n00:16:36.214 --> 00:16:40.492\nthen that's where I know it's gonna print\nout just like this, to where the upside\n\n362\n00:16:40.492 --> 00:16:43.977\ndown art is here, and then the inside\nis there, and then I fold it.\n\n363\n00:16:43.977 --> 00:16:47.340\nSo you're gonna have to figure out\nhow your printer prints it out, but\n\n364\n00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:48.319\nthat's the trick.\n\n365\n00:16:48.319 --> 00:16:51.389\nYou put this is up, this is,\nand you can put left, right,\n\n366\n00:16:51.389 --> 00:16:53.150\nyou can put all the corners.\n\n367\n00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:57.540\nSo you have that orientation to know,\nit's what they call registration in real\n\n368\n00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:01.665\nprinting, and then you can see how I'm\ngonna get that same piece of paper,\n\n369\n00:17:01.665 --> 00:17:06.117\nturn to back over, and then print it, and\nso then once you get it right, you can go\n\n370\n00:17:06.117 --> 00:17:10.832\nahead and make 15 prints out of the first,\nflip then on over, put the paper back in,\n\n371\n00:17:10.832 --> 00:17:15.483\nprint it back on out, and then you'll\nhave a two-sided envelope, not envelop,\n\n372\n00:17:15.483 --> 00:17:19.022\ninvitation that you're hopeful\nit will print out in color, and\n\n373\n00:17:19.022 --> 00:17:20.382\neverything like that.\n\n374\n00:17:20.382 --> 00:17:24.386\nSo that's, I just wanted to show you\nthat because that's where my mind goes.\n\n375\n00:17:24.386 --> 00:17:28.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we also had this cupcake guy that,\n\n376\n00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:29.560\nhe's got teeth.\n\n377\n00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:30.222\n&gt;&gt; He does.\n\n378\n00:17:30.222 --> 00:17:32.671\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\nthat's just a cute little guy.\n\n379\n00:17:32.671 --> 00:17:37.612\nSo, with the combination of the online art\nthat you have, probably some pictures,\n\n380\n00:17:37.612 --> 00:17:41.788\nand the shape that you have and how you\ncan format it, I hope you go out and\n\n381\n00:17:41.788 --> 00:17:45.003\nmake Fuego birthday invitations,\nand you know what?\n\n382\n00:17:45.003 --> 00:17:48.325\nI would love for you to make\nsome invitations for Fuego, and\n\n383\n00:17:48.325 --> 00:17:52.513\nsend them to me, at vonne@itpro.tv,\n[LAUGH] and I would love to see them,\n\n384\n00:17:52.513 --> 00:17:56.832\nbecause I think that would be really,\nreally fun, cuz I love this stuff, and\n\n385\n00:17:56.832 --> 00:17:59.689\nI just love to be silly,\nand I love graphics, and so\n\n386\n00:17:59.689 --> 00:18:02.783\nI wanted to show you how to\nmake an invitation in Excel.\n\n387\n00:18:02.783 --> 00:18:06.540\n&gt;&gt;

An overshare is what I like to\n\n19\n00:00:47.406 --> 00:00:47.959\ncall that.\n\n20\n00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:49.885\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, that's there.\n\n21\n00:00:49.885 --> 00:00:52.055\nSo we're gonna hopefully not overshare.\n\n22\n00:00:52.055 --> 00:00:56.570\nWe're gonna just share just enough to be\nable to collaborate with people because we\n\n23\n00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.010\nare in our collaborate and security\ntopic area of this particular series.\n\n24\n00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.120\nSo we have a few episodes about some fun\nthings about working with multiple people.\n\n25\n00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.430\nAnd so the first one that I'd like\nto go over is sharing workbooks.\n\n26\n00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.142\nAnd we're going to differentiate between\nwhat is a shared workbook versus\n\n27\n00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:19.070\njust sharing a link on\nyour OneDrive account.\n\n28\n00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.410\nYou're like, well it's the same thing.\n\n29\n00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.500\nIt's really not, okay?\n\n30\n00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.131\nAnd there's going to be some other things\nthat tie in with a shared workbook.\n\n31\n00:01:27.131 --> 00:01:28.552\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A wookie book,\n\n32\n00:01:28.552 --> 00:01:30.745\nChewbaca is making an appearance today.\n\n33\n00:01:30.745 --> 00:01:33.493\n&gt;&gt; [NOISE] [LAUGH] I can't make the noise.\n\n34\n00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:34.872\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That was awesome.\n\n35\n00:01:34.872 --> 00:01:36.950\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It was kinda like wierd horse.\n\n36\n00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.178\nThat wasn't a Chewbacca.\n\n37\n00:01:38.178 --> 00:01:39.492\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That was like a drunk horse.\n\n38\n00:01:39.492 --> 00:01:43.270\n[LAUGH] [NOISE].\n\n39\n00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.528\nMy, that was great.\n\n40\n00:01:44.528 --> 00:01:47.644\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so\nlet's come on back to-\n\n41\n00:01:47.644 --> 00:01:48.758\n&gt;&gt; Turn the grinder, turn the grinder.\n\n42\n00:01:48.758 --> 00:01:51.356\n&gt;&gt; Turn that grinder, right.\n\n43\n00:01:51.356 --> 00:01:52.921\nWe were talking about shared workbooks.\n\n44\n00:01:52.921 --> 00:01:55.164\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's great.\n\n45\n00:01:55.164 --> 00:01:56.445\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n46\n00:01:56.445 --> 00:01:59.003\nShared work books.\n\n47\n00:01:59.003 --> 00:02:01.458\nSee, you've got to say it a couple\nof times and get through it.\n\n48\n00:02:01.458 --> 00:02:04.778\n&gt;&gt; Let's everybody give Vonne a hand.\n\n49\n00:02:04.778 --> 00:02:05.623\n&gt;&gt; Good job.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n50\n00:02:05.623 --> 00:02:10.552\nAll right, so we are going to have some\nother things that are tied in with\n\n51\n00:02:10.552 --> 00:02:14.330\na shared workbook that\ninvolves the track changes.\n\n52\n00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.210\nSo they are kind of together but\nI wanted to separate them into two\n\n53\n00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.600\nseparate episodes because there\nis just a lot to talk about.\n\n54\n00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.630\nAnd so I wanted to go ahead and\nkeep them together yet separate.\n\n55\n00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.434\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so definitely check out the next\n\n56\n00:02:28.434 --> 00:02:32.676\nepisode in the course library,\nthat will be the track changes.\n\n57\n00:02:32.676 --> 00:02:37.187\nSo why don't I go ahead and jump into our\ncomputer and start getting into opening\n\n58\n00:02:37.187 --> 00:02:40.640\nsome files and just talking\nabout this particular concept.\n\n59\n00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.699\nSo we have a file called\nChristmas Cats Share.\n\n60\n00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.510\nAnd this is something we've probably\nbeen looking at for quite some time, and\n\n61\n00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.910\nwe have a couple of different\nworksheets in this workbook.\n\n62\n00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.150\nAnd so why would you want to share a file?\n\n63\n00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.970\nSo let's just kind of\ntalk about the theory\n\n64\n00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.720\nbehind this rather than\njust clicking on this.\n\n65\n00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:07.010\nWell what if we work in a environment\nwhere we're tracking Christmas cat sales?\n\n66\n00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.580\nOr maybe students within a program or\nanything to where you have multiple\n\n67\n00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.630\npeople on a team needing to\naccess that exact same file.\n\n68\n00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.294\nWell, then you can go ahead and\nshare the workbook and\n\n69\n00:03:19.294 --> 00:03:24.346\nwhat that allows is for multiple people\nto be able to access the workbook,\n\n70\n00:03:24.346 --> 00:03:26.803\nand then work on it in the same time.\n\n71\n00:03:26.803 --> 00:03:29.820\nAnd then making sure that\neverything gets tracked.\n\n72\n00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.520\nAnd if all of your different\nversions are being remembered and\n\n73\n00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.659\nthen it merges it all together to go\nahead and see that final product.\n\n74\n00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:41.024\nSo I know in my situation,\nworking back at university,\n\n75\n00:03:41.024 --> 00:03:43.770\nwe were tracking programs and students.\n\n76\n00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.316\nSo I had me on the first floor and there\nwas somebody else on the third floor and\n\n77\n00:03:47.316 --> 00:03:49.439\nthere was somebody else\non the second floor.\n\n78\n00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:51.780\nThat we all needed to access\nthe same information.\n\n79\n00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.590\nI could make a change but then\nsomebody else needed to make a change.\n\n80\n00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.220\nSo we needed to make sure we could be\nable to keep track of all of that.\n\n81\n00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.180\nSo we shared it out,\nwe put it into a network drive,\n\n82\n00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.680\nso all of us can be able to access it,\nand then we went ahead and did that.\n\n83\n00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.120\nNow, how is that any different?\n\n84\n00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.640\nCuz that where people go,\nwell if I had anything on the share,\n\n85\n00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.230\nif there's a shared network drive that\nwe all have the same permissions to,\n\n86\n00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.480\nI can open up any of your files.\n\n87\n00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.750\nDo something to it, and\nthen save it and go away, and\n\n88\n00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.139\nyou would be none the wiser, right?\n\n89\n00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.792\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean, so there is that situation to\n\n90\n00:04:26.792 --> 00:04:31.707\nwhere, and that's what I was kinda\nsaying like share versus shared.\n\n91\n00:04:31.707 --> 00:04:35.387\nLike actually making that\na function if you wanna say, or\n\n92\n00:04:35.387 --> 00:04:40.320\na thing that you're doing within\nthis particular file as opposed to.\n\n93\n00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.944\nNo shared workbook, and\nwe're just accessing the same file.\n\n94\n00:04:43.944 --> 00:04:49.790\nSo there's benefits to making sure\nthat you do this particular thing.\n\n95\n00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.435\nSo just kinda giving you those different\nscenarios as to where you need to do it.\n\n96\n00:04:53.435 --> 00:04:57.900\nSo where do I go to make\nthis a shared workbook?\n\n97\n00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:04.060\nYou go over to your Review tab and then\nright over there you have Share Workbook.\n\n98\n00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.166\nAnd you can see share it so\nothers can work in it at the same time.\n\n99\n00:05:09.166 --> 00:05:11.240\nBut notice it does say this little FYI,\nand\n\n100\n00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.860\nwe're gonna talk about\nwhat this really means.\n\n101\n00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.412\nBut it's saying that the containing\ntables that can't be shared.\n\n102\n00:05:16.412 --> 00:05:18.390\nThere are certain things,\n\n103\n00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:24.995\nthere's quite a lot of things that you\ncan't do if it is using a shared workbook.\n\n104\n00:05:24.995 --> 00:05:28.880\nThere's a lot of limitations and I have\nsome links in the show notes for you\n\n105\n00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.810\nto be able to access those websites and\nwe'll go ahead an pull those up as well.\n\n106\n00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.530\n&gt;&gt; If the day ends in Y, you can't share.\n\n107\n00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.584\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, right?\n\n108\n00:05:36.584 --> 00:05:38.077\nYes, [LAUGH].\n\n109\n00:05:38.077 --> 00:05:40.011\nSo what day doesn't end in Y?\n\n110\n00:05:40.011 --> 00:05:40.803\nEvery day.\n\n111\n00:05:40.803 --> 00:05:41.370\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH].\n\n112\n00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:42.860\nWhich also ends in y.\n\n113\n00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.138\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes it does, doesn't it.\n\n114\n00:05:44.138 --> 00:05:47.256\n[LAUGH] So\nwe go over here to Share Workbook and\n\n115\n00:05:47.256 --> 00:05:49.878\nyou can see allow changes to be made.\n\n116\n00:05:49.878 --> 00:05:51.170\nLet's review this again.\n\n117\n00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:53.660\nAllow changes by more than\none user at the same time.\n\n118\n00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.040\nSo it allows workbook merging.\n\n119\n00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think I've seen this before,\nwhere you go to open up a spreadsheet and\n\n120\n00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:00.690\nyou wanna make some changes.\n\n121\n00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.115\nAnd it will say, you are in View Mode or\n\n122\n00:06:03.115 --> 00:06:06.918\nnon-editing because somebody\nelse is already working on this.\n\n123\n00:06:06.918 --> 00:06:09.471\nKind of gives you that prompt\nthat at the top of the file and\n\n124\n00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:12.540\nlets you know you can't make any changes\ncuz it's already being worked on.\n\n125\n00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.910\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful foreshadowing.\n\n126\n00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.805\nYes that's exactly what we\nare going to be seeing.\n\n127\n00:06:15.805 --> 00:06:16.765\n&gt;&gt; Okay, awesome.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n128\n00:06:16.765 --> 00:06:21.545\nthat's where it's gonna indicate to you\nthat, hey we're working on the same one,\n\n129\n00:06:21.545 --> 00:06:23.229\nand that's the funny thing,\n\n130\n00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:27.229\nit's like, it's allowing for\nmore than one person at the same time.\n\n131\n00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:31.789\nBut I'll tell you that like every time I\ngo to open the shared workbook, it says,\n\n132\n00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:32.875\nbeing edited by x.\n\n133\n00:06:32.875 --> 00:06:36.685\nAnd I'm like, hey, I gotta call x and\nbe like, hey, can you close the workbook,\n\n134\n00:06:36.685 --> 00:06:39.803\nokay thanks, and they close it and\nthen I can keep on working on it.\n\n135\n00:06:39.803 --> 00:06:42.660\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You'd think there'd be a timeout where\n\n136\n00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.838\nif I was working on a workbook but I got\ndistracted, I was doing something else.\n\n137\n00:06:46.838 --> 00:06:51.398\nA little pop up would come up and say hey,\nyou've been idle for x amount of seconds,\n\n138\n00:06:51.398 --> 00:06:55.220\nyou've got 30 seconds to click on\nthis to continue or let it close.\n\n139\n00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.390\nThat would be a nice thing.\n\n140\n00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.487\n&gt;&gt; You should be a developer at Microsoft.\n\n141\n00:06:58.487 --> 00:07:01.390\n[LAUGH] You should go ahead and\nlet them know these things.\n\n142\n00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:04.630\n&gt;&gt; I've got great ideas right here\nladies and gents, right here.\n\n143\n00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:08.600\n&gt;&gt; I think you need to be on\nthe Office improvement team for sure.\n\n144\n00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.430\nBut yes, that's exactly right because\nyou go away to lunch or whatever.\n\n145\n00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:13.481\nYou keep the workbook open.\n\n146\n00:07:13.481 --> 00:07:15.055\nAnd I need to get in and guess what?\n\n147\n00:07:15.055 --> 00:07:18.304\nI can't. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; And I can't get\na hold of you cuz you're off at lunch.\n\n148\n00:07:18.304 --> 00:07:21.351\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or the good one is\nwhere they went on vacation.\n\n149\n00:07:21.351 --> 00:07:21.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n150\n00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.030\n&gt;&gt; And it's like really?\n\n151\n00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:25.942\n&gt;&gt; You're shutting down\nsomebody's computer at that point\n\n152\n00:07:25.942 --> 00:07:27.936\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what I did I called\n\n153\n00:07:27.936 --> 00:07:31.234\nour help desk and said hey guess\nwhat we need to go ahead and\n\n154\n00:07:31.234 --> 00:07:33.384\nshut that person's computer down.\n\n155\n00:07:33.384 --> 00:07:34.325\nOr you can go ahead and\n\n156\n00:07:34.325 --> 00:07:36.606\nlog in just close the file up that's fine\n&gt;&gt; Whatever you've got to do.\n\n157\n00:07:36.606 --> 00:07:39.891\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so\nit's a little bit of back and forth.\n\n158\n00:07:39.891 --> 00:07:42.870\nSo, but the whole idea here\nis to allow this to happen.\n\n159\n00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.250\nWe click OK.\n\n160\n00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.090\nAnd then you will get\na little warning that says,\n\n161\n00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:48.590\nthis action will now save the workbook.\n\n162\n00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:49.840\nDo you want to continue?\n\n163\n00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.160\nYes, so we click OK.\n\n164\n00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.620\nNow, how do I know that I\nam in a shared workbook?\n\n165\n00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.034\nIt's right up here in the title bar.\n\n166\n00:07:57.034 --> 00:08:00.446\nSo you can see in those\nbrackets right there, Shared.\n\n167\n00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:05.344\nSo that's my major indication that I\nknow that I'm in a workbook that is It\n\n168\n00:08:05.344 --> 00:08:09.373\nhas sharing capabilities within\nthis particular file, and\n\n169\n00:08:09.373 --> 00:08:11.112\nthat is a good thing to do.\n\n170\n00:08:11.112 --> 00:08:14.557\nAnd like we were just talking\nabout those different scenarios,\n\n171\n00:08:14.557 --> 00:08:18.761\nif I kept this here on my desktop, well,\nit's not really gonna do me any good,\n\n172\n00:08:18.761 --> 00:08:21.720\nnecessarily, unless I wanna\njust share with myself.\n\n173\n00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n174\n00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:26.501\n&gt;&gt; Which is fine, and just to let you\nknow, when we get into the whole idea of\n\n175\n00:08:26.501 --> 00:08:30.545\nthe tracked changes, you might not\nneed to go to that other level of,\n\n176\n00:08:30.545 --> 00:08:33.304\nlet's get it to where\nother people can use it.\n\n177\n00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:39.469\nI wanna track my own changes cuz I need\nhelp knowing where I'm at every day.\n\n178\n00:08:39.469 --> 00:08:42.494\n[LAUGH] So it's if I go ahead and do that,\n\n179\n00:08:42.494 --> 00:08:48.150\nI can see it logs all my activities,\nso again, those two are together.\n\n180\n00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:49.770\nThey work in tandem.\n\n181\n00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:52.780\nIf you track the changes,\nyou're gonna share your workbook.\n\n182\n00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.650\nIf you share your workbook,\nyou're gonna have to tracked changes.\n\n183\n00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:57.866\nSo it works hand in hand, all right?\n\n184\n00:08:57.866 --> 00:09:01.810\nSo now that I have it shared, this is\nwhere I would say, if I'm gonna wanna\n\n185\n00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:06.347\ncollaborate with people, I would put this\non a network drive, if I have that set up.\n\n186\n00:09:06.347 --> 00:09:10.859\nWell, I don't have this in this\norganization, this Christmas Cats or\n\n187\n00:09:10.859 --> 00:09:15.080\neven just our Office Pro Demo Code\nwhere all of our accounts are on.\n\n188\n00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.627\nBut I do have OneDrive, right?\n\n189\n00:09:16.627 --> 00:09:22.027\nSo I could go ahead and share this or,\nlet me use the right terminology,\n\n190\n00:09:22.027 --> 00:09:25.179\nsave it to OneDrive and then share it out.\n\n191\n00:09:25.179 --> 00:09:28.847\nOkay, so you would just need\nto put this up into the Cloud.\n\n192\n00:09:28.847 --> 00:09:31.712\nAnd the easiest way to do that is\njust go ahead and do a File Save As.\n\n193\n00:09:31.712 --> 00:09:37.610\nAnd then just go over here to your\nOneDrive account and then put it up there.\n\n194\n00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:40.870\nNow, I have some other ones that\nI've already done this process.\n\n195\n00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:45.170\nSo just pretend that I've clicked Save and\nnow it's up there.\n\n196\n00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:47.990\nSo now we're gonna go ahead and\nswitch over to another file\n\n197\n00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.560\nto where I've already done this,\nso you can kinda get the idea.\n\n198\n00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.340\nBecause just putting up in your OneDrive,\nthat's just another location.\n\n199\n00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:57.640\nYou need to be able to do the next step\n\n200\n00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:01.800\nin One Drive to be able to\nhave people access your files.\n\n201\n00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.943\nIf you're on a network drive,\neverybody access it.\n\n202\n00:10:03.943 --> 00:10:06.642\nWell, as long as they have\nthe permission to do it to get there.\n\n203\n00:10:06.642 --> 00:10:07.153\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n204\n00:10:07.153 --> 00:10:10.780\n&gt;&gt; So here, you do need to make one extra\nstep if you're gonna use this OneDrive\n\n205\n00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:14.020\naccount to be able to\ncollaborate with people.\n\n206\n00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:17.670\nSo let's pretend that we've already\nsaved it up into our drive.\n\n207\n00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:20.103\nLet's switch over to the chart data file.\n\n208\n00:10:20.103 --> 00:10:22.122\nOops, I almost went [LAUGH]\nto open it on my desktop.\n\n209\n00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:23.092\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n210\n00:10:23.092 --> 00:10:27.288\nI wanna open up the file\nthat's in my Cloud account.\n\n211\n00:10:27.288 --> 00:10:29.388\nSo let me go ahead and\nstart Excel back up.\n\n212\n00:10:29.388 --> 00:10:31.240\nI probably could've just stayed in there.\n\n213\n00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.312\nAnd we will go over here\nto open another file.\n\n214\n00:10:33.312 --> 00:10:36.790\nI wanna open a file in my OneDrive\naccount, and there it is,\n\n215\n00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:37.770\nthere is chart data.\n\n216\n00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:43.357\nSo, you have it where you're working on\nthe file that is saved up on the Cloud.\n\n217\n00:10:43.357 --> 00:10:48.079\nThe next step is to go over to File and\nthen go to Share.\n\n218\n00:10:48.079 --> 00:10:52.830\nAnd when you go to Share, you're saying\nthat you want to share with people,\n\n219\n00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:56.490\nyou want to send invitations and\nget sharing links.\n\n220\n00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:59.372\nOkay, remember, you can't do this unless\nit's up in a OneDrive account first.\n\n221\n00:10:59.372 --> 00:11:02.950\nAnd it'll warn you if you try,\nso I'm gonna click on this.\n\n222\n00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:07.240\nAnd normally, if this is the first time\nthat I'm doing this, none of these other\n\n223\n00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:11.960\nguys over here, see like the Joe Fatone,\nand then anyone can edit this link.\n\n224\n00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:16.081\nIt would just show you as the owner, as,\nwell, for me, I'm Justin Timberlake.\n\n225\n00:11:16.081 --> 00:11:19.540\nSo [LAUGH] in these ones,\nthis has already been done.\n\n226\n00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:22.772\nBut let me go down,\nbehind my head actually,\n\n227\n00:11:22.772 --> 00:11:26.781\nyou can see there is an option\nhere to Get a Sharing Link.\n\n228\n00:11:26.781 --> 00:11:31.662\nNow when you Get a Sharing Link, this is\nto where it's saying anyone with this link\n\n229\n00:11:31.662 --> 00:11:33.737\ncan edit the documents you share.\n\n230\n00:11:33.737 --> 00:11:38.620\nSo it's like you can\nhand it out to anyone.\n\n231\n00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:42.774\nIt doesn't have to be through your\norganization or through an emailing.\n\n232\n00:11:42.774 --> 00:11:48.660\nIt's just like say Daniel is on Gmail and\nI need to send it to him.\n\n233\n00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:52.170\nI could go ahead and copy this,\ngo ahead and launch my mail and\n\n234\n00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:54.800\nthen paste this link into his.\n\n235\n00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.080\nEmail it and sent it off to him.\n\n236\n00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.648\nThe other thing you can do is\nnotice you can do a View only link.\n\n237\n00:11:59.648 --> 00:12:03.092\nMaybe I don't want people to edit this,\nI only want them to see this.\n\n238\n00:12:03.092 --> 00:12:07.491\nSo, this particular part\nof sharing a file isn't\n\n239\n00:12:07.491 --> 00:12:11.483\nmutually connected to the shared workbook.\n\n240\n00:12:11.483 --> 00:12:17.543\nI could go ahead and give anybody\na View only link to a OneDrive file.\n\n241\n00:12:17.543 --> 00:12:22.107\nCuz say it's just my Excel file that's\ncharting my cat toy inventry and,\n\n242\n00:12:22.107 --> 00:12:22.852\ninventry?\n\n243\n00:12:22.852 --> 00:12:23.401\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n244\n00:12:23.401 --> 00:12:24.596\n&gt;&gt; Inventory.\n[LAUGH]\n\n245\n00:12:24.596 --> 00:12:25.372\n&gt;&gt; If you were from\n\n246\n00:12:25.372 --> 00:12:27.706\nGreat Britain that would\nbe perfect English.\n\n247\n00:12:27.706 --> 00:12:30.946\n&gt;&gt; And I wanna send it to you,\nbut I only want you to see it,\n\n248\n00:12:30.946 --> 00:12:35.245\nI don't want you to edit it I would go\nahead and grab this View only link and\n\n249\n00:12:35.245 --> 00:12:37.030\nthen send that there, okay?\n\n250\n00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:40.425\nSo remember, two separate topics, but\nI'm kinda putting everything together.\n\n251\n00:12:40.425 --> 00:12:42.758\nWe're doing a multi-teach right now.\n\n252\n00:12:42.758 --> 00:12:44.196\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n253\n00:12:44.196 --> 00:12:46.517\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nclick that right there.\n\n254\n00:12:46.517 --> 00:12:47.899\nOops, let me go ahead and back.\n\n255\n00:12:47.899 --> 00:12:48.689\nSorry, let me back up.\n\n256\n00:12:48.689 --> 00:12:52.183\nWe'll go back over to Share with people.\n\n257\n00:12:52.183 --> 00:12:56.431\nNow the other thing here is,\nJoey Fatone already can edit this,\n\n258\n00:12:56.431 --> 00:13:00.061\nis that if I had people\nwithin my organization, okay?\n\n259\n00:13:00.061 --> 00:13:05.128\nI want to give them an email to go ahead\nand come into it, I can just type,\n\n260\n00:13:05.128 --> 00:13:09.640\nfor example,\nlet's add Lance into this party, right?\n\n261\n00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:16.210\nI wanna give Lance a email that's going\nto invite him into either edit or view.\n\n262\n00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:19.781\nSo, in this sense, this is tied all\ninto your global address list and\n\n263\n00:13:19.781 --> 00:13:21.396\nyour Outlook and everything.\n\n264\n00:13:21.396 --> 00:13:24.004\nSo with staying within your organization,\n\n265\n00:13:24.004 --> 00:13:27.177\nthen you can go ahead and\njust invite people this way.\n\n266\n00:13:27.177 --> 00:13:28.462\nIt's a little bit easier.\n\n267\n00:13:28.462 --> 00:13:32.944\nAnd maybe we're chatting on Skype or\nsomething.\n\n268\n00:13:32.944 --> 00:13:34.560\nI can just send you the link or\nsomething like that.\n\n269\n00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.490\nSo two different ways\nthat you can do this.\n\n270\n00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:40.370\nAnd doing it this way,\nI can go ahead and share it with him.\n\n271\n00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:43.910\nIt goes ahead and\nis sending the email out.\n\n272\n00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:48.482\nAnd now you can see on my end\nas I'm the owner of this file,\n\n273\n00:13:48.482 --> 00:13:54.119\nI have sent out emails to Joey and\nLance to be able to edit the document.\n\n274\n00:13:54.119 --> 00:13:57.300\nAnd I'm gonna come into\nthis link one more time.\n\n275\n00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.689\nAnd let's get that sharing link and\n\n276\n00:13:59.689 --> 00:14:03.998\nI'm going to copy this just to\ndemonstrate a few little things.\n\n277\n00:14:03.998 --> 00:14:07.880\nAll right, so\nthat was my next step of sharing.\n\n278\n00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:10.165\nSo now let's switch over.\n\n279\n00:14:10.165 --> 00:14:12.750\n[LAUGH] If you've watch\nthe Outlook series,\n\n280\n00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:15.988\nI have quite a different\nfew personalities there.\n\n281\n00:14:15.988 --> 00:14:17.683\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm Justin, I'm Joey,\n\n282\n00:14:17.683 --> 00:14:20.785\nI'm Lance and Nick let's go ahead and\nnow let's do a little swipe.\n\n283\n00:14:20.785 --> 00:14:23.607\nAnd we will come over to Joey's computer.\n\n284\n00:14:23.607 --> 00:14:28.174\nBecause I wanna show you what, on\nthe receiving end, that the person you're\n\n285\n00:14:28.174 --> 00:14:32.890\ncollaborating with, with that shared\nworkbook, is going to receive.\n\n286\n00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:38.779\nSo I've got an invitation, remember,\nI'm Joey now, from Justin that I have\n\n287\n00:14:38.779 --> 00:14:44.329\nbeen included to have chart data as\nthe file that I want to be working with.\n\n288\n00:14:44.329 --> 00:14:49.195\nSo I'm like, oo, that sounds exciting,\nso I click on this, and it comes up m2.\n\n289\n00:14:49.195 --> 00:14:52.400\nHere I have to log into\nmy account from Joey.\n\n290\n00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.976\nGood, it remembers my password\nbecause it's a strong one.\n\n291\n00:14:55.976 --> 00:14:58.940\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I always type it in wrong.\n\n292\n00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:03.960\nAll right, so now, look, okay,\nso it says, hey, guess what?\n\n293\n00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.790\nWe can't open a workbook\nin the browser because\n\n294\n00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:11.190\nthere are unsupported\nfeatures of workbook sharing.\n\n295\n00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:12.944\nSo this is a little kicker right here.\n\n296\n00:15:12.944 --> 00:15:15.290\nIt's not that it isn't gonna work.\n\n297\n00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:22.062\nIt's just saying that the online Excel\nis not gonna be able to work with this.\n\n298\n00:15:22.062 --> 00:15:24.973\nBut do you want to open it in Excel?\n\n299\n00:15:24.973 --> 00:15:29.031\nYes, so this where the other side of\nthe fence, the other person that you're\n\n300\n00:15:29.031 --> 00:15:33.043\nworking with, they will need to have\na locally installed version of Excel.\n\n301\n00:15:33.043 --> 00:15:36.220\nYou can't be doing this online.\n\n302\n00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:40.946\nYou can still go ahead and all access the\nsame file, without the shared capability.\n\n303\n00:15:40.946 --> 00:15:45.796\nSo remember that differentiation\nof actually using this feature of\n\n304\n00:15:45.796 --> 00:15:49.028\nin the file,\nversus just putting a file up and\n\n305\n00:15:49.028 --> 00:15:52.870\nus accessing the same thing\nin the same place, okay?\n\n306\n00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:55.685\nLittle bit of different functionality.\n\n307\n00:15:55.685 --> 00:16:03.917\nOpen in Excel, and I think I'm gonna get\na warning that will happen and Yes, okay.\n\n308\n00:16:03.917 --> 00:16:04.642\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n309\n00:16:04.642 --> 00:16:06.568\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] This is the one you\nwere talking about, weren't you?\n\n310\n00:16:06.568 --> 00:16:07.316\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n311\n00:16:07.316 --> 00:16:08.459\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you've experienced this before?\n\n312\n00:16:08.459 --> 00:16:09.230\n&gt;&gt; I have seen this before, many times.\n\n313\n00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:12.570\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, and it says, Read-Only,\n\n314\n00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:13.331\nwell, why?\n\n315\n00:16:13.331 --> 00:16:17.456\nIf I wanna edit it,\nlooks at what happens, this, and here,\n\n316\n00:16:17.456 --> 00:16:22.263\nlet me zoom in, in case you can't see it,\nJustin has it open right now.\n\n317\n00:16:22.263 --> 00:16:23.034\n&gt;&gt; That JT.\n\n318\n00:16:23.034 --> 00:16:23.564\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n319\n00:16:23.564 --> 00:16:24.954\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He's so cool, though,\n\n320\n00:16:24.954 --> 00:16:25.553\nwe'll let him have it.\n\n321\n00:16:25.553 --> 00:16:28.879\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So this is that whole, hey, JT,\n\n322\n00:16:28.879 --> 00:16:32.157\nso this is Joey, can you go ahead and\nclose that file?\n\n323\n00:16:32.157 --> 00:16:35.977\nOkay, great, thanks, so\nit's one of those types of things.\n\n324\n00:16:35.977 --> 00:16:39.010\nBut it doesn't receive a notification\nwhen the server file's available.\n\n325\n00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:43.120\nI mean, that's nice, because my\nonly option here is to read-only or\n\n326\n00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.026\nsave and edit,\n\n327\n00:16:44.026 --> 00:16:48.638\nwhich kinda defeats the whole purpose of\nus working on the same file together.\n\n328\n00:16:48.638 --> 00:16:52.599\nSo I'm going to cancel this, and\nI'm going to close the file.\n\n329\n00:16:52.599 --> 00:16:56.303\nI'm gonna keep Excel open so\nit makes it a little bit easier for\n\n330\n00:16:56.303 --> 00:16:57.738\nus to open this back up.\n\n331\n00:16:57.738 --> 00:17:02.222\nLet's come back over to Justin,\nnow, I swiped over,\n\n332\n00:17:02.222 --> 00:17:07.587\nI'm in JT's computer,\nclose out of the Excel file altogether,\n\n333\n00:17:07.587 --> 00:17:11.701\nso I've closed out of\nthe chart data shared file.\n\n334\n00:17:11.701 --> 00:17:16.651\nCome back over to here, now the cool thing\nwith Joey is that he was already given\n\n335\n00:17:16.651 --> 00:17:21.080\nthat link, and I have opened that\nfile before on his computer.\n\n336\n00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:25.260\nSo I'm gonna come over here to Open, and\nnotice right here, your recent files,\n\n337\n00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.048\nthat's not on Joey's computer.\n\n338\n00:17:27.048 --> 00:17:31.262\nYou can see the address of okay,\npersonal, JT, da da, okay, great,\n\n339\n00:17:31.262 --> 00:17:34.850\nthis is that shared file\nthat Justin gave me.\n\n340\n00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:38.995\nSo I'll go ahead and come into here,\nand, you're like, what's going on?\n\n341\n00:17:38.995 --> 00:17:41.832\nSee, this one's a totally different one,\nit was,\n\n342\n00:17:41.832 --> 00:17:44.360\nhey, you need to,\ndo you want to edit this?\n\n343\n00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:50.143\nBut I didn't get that second warning of\nJT is working on it, so, okay, perfect.\n\n344\n00:17:50.143 --> 00:17:52.954\nSo now I can come into here,\nand make my changes,\n\n345\n00:17:52.954 --> 00:17:55.298\njust to make a significant difference.\n\n346\n00:17:55.298 --> 00:18:00.151\nWe'll change our number,\nif Fuego needs a nap, yes, he does.\n\n347\n00:18:00.151 --> 00:18:05.767\nAnd then I will do that,\nsave my changes, and then Justin will be\n\n348\n00:18:05.767 --> 00:18:12.260\nable to see all of the options that\nI have done, and that's wonderful.\n\n349\n00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:18.843\nAgain, tying it in with the next lesson\nof tracking, that's where you're like.\n\n350\n00:18:18.843 --> 00:18:23.428\nCuz if you're like me, I'm kinda like,\nthis really isn't any different than just\n\n351\n00:18:23.428 --> 00:18:25.947\naccessing the same file\nin the same location,\n\n352\n00:18:25.947 --> 00:18:28.996\nwhere is this extra feature\nthat you're asking about?\n\n353\n00:18:28.996 --> 00:18:30.477\n[LAUGH] I'll get there, [LAUGH].\n\n354\n00:18:30.477 --> 00:18:32.039\n&gt;&gt; We're coming around.\n\n355\n00:18:32.039 --> 00:18:32.649\n&gt;&gt; We're coming around.\n\n356\n00:18:32.649 --> 00:18:34.560\n&gt;&gt; You've gotta-\n&gt;&gt; Just turn the wheel.\n\n357\n00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.546\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just turn the wheel, easy,\n\n358\n00:18:36.546 --> 00:18:37.729\nyou can miss the cones.\n\n359\n00:18:37.729 --> 00:18:39.801\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You've got to crawl before you can\n\n360\n00:18:39.801 --> 00:18:41.264\nwalk and\nyou've got to walk before you can run.\n\n361\n00:18:41.264 --> 00:18:41.833\n&gt;&gt; Before you can run.\n\n362\n00:18:41.833 --> 00:18:45.586\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so we've got to know where\nwe're going, so just that sharing part.\n\n363\n00:18:45.586 --> 00:18:50.520\nNow one thing to make note of is\nthat if you're going to be the owner\n\n364\n00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:55.020\nof your shared document,\nlike Justin is the owner.\n\n365\n00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:59.531\nOne thing that you need to be careful\nabout is, because of that track changes\n\n366\n00:18:59.531 --> 00:19:03.562\nthat we're gonna get to the next episode,\nthey could turn him off.\n\n367\n00:19:03.562 --> 00:19:08.957\nIf I don't lock this down to where,\nhey, I'm doing these shared\n\n368\n00:19:08.957 --> 00:19:13.877\nfunctionality because I want\nto track what you're doing.\n\n369\n00:19:13.877 --> 00:19:18.527\nI want to be able to have a log file of\neverything that you're doing, so if I\n\n370\n00:19:18.527 --> 00:19:24.007\nleave that open, you, it's almost like you\nhave administrative rights to the file.\n\n371\n00:19:24.007 --> 00:19:26.994\nSo you could go in there like,\nI'm gonna stop sharing this.\n\n372\n00:19:26.994 --> 00:19:28.656\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I'm gonna stop having you\n\n373\n00:19:28.656 --> 00:19:31.452\ntrack this, and I'm gonna,\nI'm turning it off,\n\n374\n00:19:31.452 --> 00:19:34.458\ncuz you have the same privileges\nthat I do to this file.\n\n375\n00:19:34.458 --> 00:19:38.843\nSo something you might want to do is lock\nthat down to where if they go and try and\n\n376\n00:19:38.843 --> 00:19:42.756\nturn off the trap changes on a shared\nworkbook, it's gonna be like,\n\n377\n00:19:42.756 --> 00:19:44.123\ndo you have a password?\n\n378\n00:19:44.123 --> 00:19:46.030\nAnd they're gonna be like.\n\n379\n00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:47.296\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Beat me to it.\n\n380\n00:19:47.296 --> 00:19:49.073\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right,\n\n381\n00:19:49.073 --> 00:19:53.308\nbut the one thing to notice that on\nhere is that you need to make sure\n\n382\n00:19:53.308 --> 00:19:56.851\nthat you do this before you share it,\nit's all in one.\n\n383\n00:19:56.851 --> 00:20:01.559\nYou have to protect and share,\nit can't be one or the other.\n\n384\n00:20:01.559 --> 00:20:03.144\n&gt;&gt; So either you have sharing or\nyou have protect and sharing.\n\n385\n00:20:03.144 --> 00:20:06.916\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah, so, and\nI believe if I have this one here.\n\n386\n00:20:06.916 --> 00:20:10.576\nAnd I'm just picking a random file\nright now, and this is on my desktop,\n\n387\n00:20:10.576 --> 00:20:13.996\nthis is not, though there is a trap\ntest that's up in the Cloud, but\n\n388\n00:20:13.996 --> 00:20:15.331\nthis is a different file.\n\n389\n00:20:15.331 --> 00:20:19.277\nSo if we come back over here, and we go to\nShare Workbook, and I click Yes, I want to\n\n390\n00:20:19.277 --> 00:20:23.250\nallow users to change this, and I'll\nsave this, okay, this is shared, right?\n\n391\n00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:28.011\nAnd it's like, protect shared workbook,\nso I click on it, and it's like,\n\n392\n00:20:28.011 --> 00:20:29.532\ngreat, I want to do this.\n\n393\n00:20:29.532 --> 00:20:34.407\nBut notice that it says, passwords may\nonly be added if the workbook is unshared\n\n394\n00:20:34.407 --> 00:20:36.900\nat the time of protection.\n\n395\n00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:40.529\nIt's like, hm, okay, well, thanks.\n\n396\n00:20:40.529 --> 00:20:43.785\nSo the thing is, don't click this and\nthen click this,\n\n397\n00:20:43.785 --> 00:20:46.992\nwatch, let me close and\ndon't save this for a second.\n\n398\n00:20:46.992 --> 00:20:49.923\nCome over here to a brand new file\nthat doesn't have any sharing or\n\n399\n00:20:49.923 --> 00:20:50.893\nanything like that.\n\n400\n00:20:50.893 --> 00:20:55.899\nIf I come over to Review, look at what\nthat one says, Protect and Share.\n\n401\n00:20:55.899 --> 00:21:00.584\nThere's that all-in-one package of where\nit's saying that for me to add a password,\n\n402\n00:21:00.584 --> 00:21:02.433\nit can't be shared to begin with.\n\n403\n00:21:02.433 --> 00:21:05.977\nBut then once I go ahead and lock it,\nI do wanna share it right after that.\n\n404\n00:21:05.977 --> 00:21:11.276\nSo that's what this particular button is\ngonna see, and once I choose that and\n\n405\n00:21:11.276 --> 00:21:16.429\ntype in apple for my password, and\nthen apple again, and that will save it.\n\n406\n00:21:16.429 --> 00:21:21.174\nNow when somebody comes in, somebody\nother than me or somebody that doesn't\n\n407\n00:21:21.174 --> 00:21:25.776\nhave a password, they can't do this\nwhole unshare and take it off, yeah.\n\n408\n00:21:25.776 --> 00:21:30.342\nSo that's a big deal right there for\nmaking sure other people are not allowed\n\n409\n00:21:30.342 --> 00:21:33.569\nto do that, see,\nnotice that's not even an option.\n\n410\n00:21:33.569 --> 00:21:37.193\n&gt;&gt; It's amazing to me how many people do\nnot understand the concept of why we want\n\n411\n00:21:37.193 --> 00:21:38.977\nto audit or track what is happening and\n\n412\n00:21:38.977 --> 00:21:42.234\nthey want to share their passwords,\nthey want to share everything.\n\n413\n00:21:42.234 --> 00:21:45.046\nIt just makes it easier,\nyes, it does make it easier,\n\n414\n00:21:45.046 --> 00:21:49.281\nit also makes it easier for me to pretend\nI'm you and do something I shouldn't do.\n\n415\n00:21:49.281 --> 00:21:53.738\nOr if I did something wrong and I don't\ncop to it, I don't own up that I did it,\n\n416\n00:21:53.738 --> 00:21:57.941\nwe don't know who did, because I\ncan't prove, cuz I have no tracking.\n\n417\n00:21:57.941 --> 00:22:02.699\nSo this is a very good thing to leave\nthat paper trail of who's done what,\n\n418\n00:22:02.699 --> 00:22:07.460\nbecause maybe it's not for the purposes\nof cracking a whip on somebody.\n\n419\n00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:11.336\nBut just, okay, we saw that you did this,\nand here's where you went wrong, and\n\n420\n00:22:11.336 --> 00:22:14.887\nnow let's all have a learning moment\nright now and not do that ever again.\n\n421\n00:22:14.887 --> 00:22:19.613\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yes, it is very important\nto make sure that that whole concept is\n\n422\n00:22:19.613 --> 00:22:23.588\nkind of drilled into our heads\na little bit, [LAUGH], and yeah,\n\n423\n00:22:23.588 --> 00:22:25.800\ndefinitely keeping it up.\n\n424\n00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:32.171\nSo now, what I do wanna talk about is some\nof the limitations of shared workbooks.\n\n425\n00:22:32.171 --> 00:22:36.483\nI'm gonna close this,\nI'm gonna come back into Excel and\n\n426\n00:22:36.483 --> 00:22:41.248\nopen up the one that is on the,\nhere we go, the chart data, yes.\n\n427\n00:22:41.248 --> 00:22:45.578\nSo I'm gonna come into the chart data,\nthis is the one that's on the share,\n\n428\n00:22:45.578 --> 00:22:49.032\nshare meaning two levels,\nremember, I'm Justin now.\n\n429\n00:22:49.032 --> 00:22:52.695\nLook at the changes that just happened,\nthere's the 1,000 hours of eating.\n\n430\n00:22:52.695 --> 00:22:55.395\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Fuego does, that's about right,\n\n431\n00:22:55.395 --> 00:22:57.627\nand Bishop does like to sleep a lot,\nyes, he does.\n\n432\n00:22:57.627 --> 00:23:00.892\nSo I can see all\nthe changes that Joey made,\n\n433\n00:23:00.892 --> 00:23:05.632\nbut okay, look, I can't move this chart,\nI can't do that.\n\n434\n00:23:05.632 --> 00:23:08.605\nI come into, I can add a new worksheet,\nI can do stuff like that,\n\n435\n00:23:08.605 --> 00:23:11.762\nbut what about conditional formatting,\nthat's grayed out.\n\n436\n00:23:11.762 --> 00:23:15.147\nAnd what if I wanted to insert,\nwow I can't.\n\n437\n00:23:15.147 --> 00:23:16.406\n&gt;&gt; You can't do anything\nin the insert tab.\n\n438\n00:23:16.406 --> 00:23:19.073\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH], exactly, so once it's shared,\n\n439\n00:23:19.073 --> 00:23:23.574\nyou can't do a lot of different things,\nlike adding illustrations,\n\n440\n00:23:23.574 --> 00:23:27.024\ndoing conditional formatting,\nall sorts of stuff.\n\n441\n00:23:27.024 --> 00:23:30.724\nHey, conditional formatting might be\nsomething you do all the time in your\n\n442\n00:23:30.724 --> 00:23:31.556\norganization.\n\n443\n00:23:31.556 --> 00:23:34.528\nWell, then,\nyou might not want to go ahead and\n\n444\n00:23:34.528 --> 00:23:38.646\nuse this functionality of sharing,\ndoing a shared workbook and\n\n445\n00:23:38.646 --> 00:23:43.770\nthen tracking the changes, that's just\nnot gonna fly, it's not gonna work.\n\n446\n00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:45.805\nSo there's a lot of limitations, and\n\n447\n00:23:45.805 --> 00:23:48.991\nI actually forgot to pull up\nthe website before we started.\n\n448\n00:23:48.991 --> 00:23:51.283\n[LAUGH] So I don't want you guys\nbeing like, I gotta find it and\n\n449\n00:23:51.283 --> 00:23:52.670\nthen switch over to my other computer.\n\n450\n00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:56.227\nBut just know that there is a list of,\ncan't do this and can't do this, and\n\n451\n00:23:56.227 --> 00:23:59.116\nthere's another column that\nsays what's the work around.\n\n452\n00:23:59.116 --> 00:24:00.331\nA lot of them is there is none.\n\n453\n00:24:00.331 --> 00:24:02.963\nThere is none, [LAUGH],\nyou just can't do this.\n\n454\n00:24:02.963 --> 00:24:07.228\nAnd the other thing to take note of,\nlet me open up.\n\n455\n00:24:07.228 --> 00:24:09.726\nThere are Christmas cats example.\n\n456\n00:24:09.726 --> 00:24:10.623\nI'm coming into Handbook.\n\n457\n00:24:10.623 --> 00:24:14.257\nOkay, I'm ready to share my workbook,\nand I go to review,\n\n458\n00:24:14.257 --> 00:24:18.619\nor I want to do the track changes and\neverything or share the workbook and\n\n459\n00:24:18.619 --> 00:24:21.549\nit's like, whoops, no, you can't do this.\n\n460\n00:24:21.549 --> 00:24:22.740\nWhy can't I do this?\n\n461\n00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:26.724\nYou can't share out workbooks that\nhave tables, formatted tables.\n\n462\n00:24:26.724 --> 00:24:27.920\nI love tables.\n\n463\n00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:28.754\n&gt;&gt; That's very limiting.\n\n464\n00:24:28.754 --> 00:24:29.452\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n465\n00:24:29.452 --> 00:24:34.039\nTables are so awesome,\nyou can't use that in that shared,\n\n466\n00:24:34.039 --> 00:24:35.927\ntrack changes-\n&gt;&gt; I wonder why that is.\n\n467\n00:24:35.927 --> 00:24:40.130\n&gt;&gt; I honestly don't know,\nI'm sure I could research it a little bit.\n\n468\n00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:42.739\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the arbitrary hand of\nBill Gates came down and said,\n\n469\n00:24:42.739 --> 00:24:43.894\nyou shall not use tables.\n\n470\n00:24:43.894 --> 00:24:45.522\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n471\n00:24:45.522 --> 00:24:47.794\n&gt;&gt; Well, the other thing that I can think\n\n472\n00:24:47.794 --> 00:24:50.137\nof, this is what I'm hypothesizing,\n\n473\n00:24:50.137 --> 00:24:53.850\nis that it does say the whole\nthing about XML maps.\n\n474\n00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:57.224\nAnd remember, the whole extension,\nthe XLS versus XLSX-\n\n475\n00:24:57.224 --> 00:24:58.068\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n476\n00:24:58.068 --> 00:25:00.262\n&gt;&gt; -of where it could do so\nmuch more functionality.\n\n477\n00:25:00.262 --> 00:25:02.232\nAnd the formatting of the tables and\n\n478\n00:25:02.232 --> 00:25:06.640\nthe kinda pulling all the automatic\nformatting, and all that kinda fun stuff.\n\n479\n00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:09.660\nI'm wondering if it has\nsomething to do with that?\n\n480\n00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:13.730\nLike, that language just can't work,\nand how it's gonna track it.\n\n481\n00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:15.838\nI might be completely making something up,\nright now.\n\n482\n00:25:15.838 --> 00:25:16.706\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Pure speculation.\n\n483\n00:25:16.706 --> 00:25:18.357\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Pure speculation, on that one.\n\n484\n00:25:18.357 --> 00:25:24.240\nBut it does have a large list\nof why you can't do that.\n\n485\n00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:28.389\nSo, but it does say if I really wanted\nto do this I could covert it to a range.\n\n486\n00:25:28.389 --> 00:25:31.235\nRemember going back over into\nconvert to a normal range.\n\n487\n00:25:31.235 --> 00:25:31.884\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n488\n00:25:31.884 --> 00:25:32.788\n&gt;&gt; And use it that way.\n\n489\n00:25:32.788 --> 00:25:35.800\nSo you have kind of,\nit's like picking your battles.\n\n490\n00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.717\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Which one's more important,\n\n491\n00:25:37.717 --> 00:25:40.591\ntracking the changes or\nkeeping all the formatting?\n\n492\n00:25:40.591 --> 00:25:45.829\nAnd this is where you say, I might not do\nthat whole making it a shared workbook.\n\n493\n00:25:45.829 --> 00:25:50.389\nWe will go ahead and access the same file\nand we have enough trust between each\n\n494\n00:25:50.389 --> 00:25:53.820\nother that we're just not\ngoing to compromise the data.\n\n495\n00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:54.810\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n496\n00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:58.000\n&gt;&gt; And we're all okay,\nI don't need this extra functionality.\n\n497\n00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.942\nSo you are going to have to decide\nwhich one's more important.\n\n498\n00:26:01.942 --> 00:26:05.190\n&gt;&gt; Could you use a table\nwhen you create it,\n\n499\n00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:08.790\ntake the table turning it into a range,\nthen share it?\n\n500\n00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:11.760\nThe person that you share it with\nthen makes it a table again,\n\n501\n00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.128\ndoes what they need to do,\nreconverse it back to you?\n\n502\n00:26:14.128 --> 00:26:16.570\nI mean it's obviously a lot of work,\nbut I guess that would be a workaround.\n\n503\n00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:17.740\n&gt;&gt; There's always workarounds out there.\n\n504\n00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:19.367\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, usually.\n\n505\n00:26:19.367 --> 00:26:21.904\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\nit's one of those where it's like, hey,\n\n506\n00:26:21.904 --> 00:26:24.190\nyou just memorize those steps and\nyou do it.\n\n507\n00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:26.070\nSomebody else comes in like,\nwhy do you do it this way?\n\n508\n00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:26.760\nIt's like-\n&gt;&gt; Because it's\n\n509\n00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.044\nthe only way to make that happen.\n\n510\n00:26:28.044 --> 00:26:28.896\nThat's why.\n[LAUGH]\n\n511\n00:26:28.896 --> 00:26:30.103\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] This is the only way it works.\n\n512\n00:26:30.103 --> 00:26:33.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So, okay, if it works.\n\n513\n00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:34.957\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you wanna break out your code and\nhacking skills.\n\n514\n00:26:34.957 --> 00:26:36.686\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so.\n\n515\n00:26:36.686 --> 00:26:38.043\n&gt;&gt; I can't do it.\n\n516\n00:26:38.043 --> 00:26:40.302\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nat least you know the limitations.\n\n517\n00:26:40.302 --> 00:26:42.274\nWhat it actually means,\nit really is one button.\n\n518\n00:26:42.274 --> 00:26:45.870\nYou just click and share it and\nthen go ahead and put it in location.\n\n519\n00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:47.780\nIn the next episode,\nwhere the track changes,\n\n520\n00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:49.470\nthis is where you might be like, no.\n\n521\n00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:50.140\nYou know what?\n\n522\n00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:53.250\nWe really need that, so we'll forgo the,\n\n523\n00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:57.160\nyou can't mess with the charts,\nyou can't do anything as a table, and\n\n524\n00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:01.720\nall the other things in a major list\nright there cuz I need to track you.\n\n525\n00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.093\nI need to make sure I\nkeep my eyes on you so.\n\n526\n00:27:03.093 --> 00:27:03.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n527\n00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:05.412\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, good you took care of yourself.\n\n528\n00:27:05.412 --> 00:27:07.435\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n529\n00:27:07.435 --> 00:27:08.304\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n530\n00:27:08.304 --> 00:27:09.303\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right.\n\n531\n00:27:09.303 --> 00:27:10.851\nVonne, well, very cool, right?\n\n532\n00:27:10.851 --> 00:27:13.407\nWe've got sharing.\nWe understand the difference between\n\n533\n00:27:13.407 --> 00:27:15.967\na shared worksheet and\nsharing a worksheet.\n\n534\n00:27:15.967 --> 00:27:19.838\nSo those are two different things,\nmake sure that you do grasp that concept\n\n535\n00:27:19.838 --> 00:27:22.604\nbecause although it's\na slight derivation of each,\n\n536\n00:27:22.604 --> 00:27:24.523\nyou do wanna make that distinction.\n\n537\n00:27:24.523 --> 00:27:28.023\nVonne I think you did a great job of\nmaking that distinction for us so\n\n538\n00:27:28.023 --> 00:27:30.990\nwe understand it, and\ncan work with in inside of Excel.\n\n539\n00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:33.200\nThat being said,\nwe are out of time for this episode.\n\n540\n00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.640\nBut don't worry, we've got more to come,\n\n541\n00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:38.300\nso join us in this series\nas we continue to trek on.\n\n542\n00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:39.960\nAs for this, though,\nwe are ready to sign off.\n\n543\n00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.550\nFor Office Pro TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n544\n00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:43.250\n&gt;&gt;

I know.\n&gt;&gt; And a Kangol.\n\n17\n00:00:39.828 --> 00:00:43.797\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That would have been so cool.\n\n18\n00:00:43.797 --> 00:00:47.164\nYes, we know what we are products of-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n19\n00:00:47.164 --> 00:00:48.650\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What decade [LAUGH] so.\n\n20\n00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.480\nBut we are gonna be talking\nabout track changes, and\n\n21\n00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.672\nthis does correlate with\nthe shared workbooks episode.\n\n22\n00:00:56.672 --> 00:00:58.078\nI'm already doing it again.\n\n23\n00:00:58.078 --> 00:00:58.947\n&gt;&gt; The wookiebooks.\n\n24\n00:00:58.947 --> 00:01:00.245\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They are not wookies,\n\n25\n00:01:00.245 --> 00:01:00.805\nthey are workbooks.\n\n26\n00:01:00.805 --> 00:01:05.379\n[LAUGH] So we're gonna go ahead and jump\ndown into this, so what is track changes?\n\n27\n00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.515\nNow, if you've done this in Word,\nI'm not sure if you were my host for\n\n28\n00:01:08.515 --> 00:01:11.562\nthat particular episode, but\nwe have done this in another series.\n\n29\n00:01:11.562 --> 00:01:14.660\n&gt;&gt; I think I was, actually, I think,\nyeah, we talked about this.\n\n30\n00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.280\nSo basically, you make a change and\nyou're able to take a look and\n\n31\n00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.610\nsee the changes that were made,\neven if they don't appear normally.\n\n32\n00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.591\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and so\n\n33\n00:01:23.591 --> 00:01:27.945\nif we were collaborating together on\nour final thesis, or what have you.\n\n34\n00:01:27.945 --> 00:01:30.752\nWell, I guess on your thesis,\nI think you do that by yourself.\n\n35\n00:01:30.752 --> 00:01:33.086\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're supposed to.\n\n36\n00:01:33.086 --> 00:01:34.787\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n37\n00:01:34.787 --> 00:01:38.172\n[LAUGH] we're working on our book, right?\n\n38\n00:01:38.172 --> 00:01:41.808\nWe are doing a book about about wookies,\nand so we wanna go [LAUGH] ahead and\n\n39\n00:01:41.808 --> 00:01:42.896\ntake that together.\n\n40\n00:01:42.896 --> 00:01:45.636\nAnd we work together,\nI do some stuff, he does some stuff.\n\n41\n00:01:45.636 --> 00:01:49.360\nAnd let's say that I'm\nthe controlling partner in this and\n\n42\n00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.199\nthat I can be like nope, nope, okay, nope.\n\n43\n00:01:52.199 --> 00:01:54.988\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And I can, basically, accept or\n\n44\n00:01:54.988 --> 00:01:58.491\nreject any changes that Daniel\ndoes because I'm the controller.\n\n45\n00:01:58.491 --> 00:01:59.847\n&gt;&gt; You sound just like my editor.\n\n46\n00:01:59.847 --> 00:02:02.085\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, yeah.\n\n47\n00:02:02.085 --> 00:02:05.628\nSo we correlate that same\nthing over into Excel, and so\n\n48\n00:02:05.628 --> 00:02:07.795\nwe could do the exact same thing.\n\n49\n00:02:07.795 --> 00:02:11.137\nI want to track the changes,\nit's like a log file of a,\n\n50\n00:02:11.137 --> 00:02:13.404\nwhen did this happen on this server?\n\n51\n00:02:13.404 --> 00:02:16.710\nAnd now I'm starting to talk\nin your language a little bit.\n\n52\n00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.249\nSo, that's the whole gist\nof what track changes does.\n\n53\n00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:23.938\nNow, as soon as you turn on track changes,\n\n54\n00:02:23.938 --> 00:02:30.406\nyou're automatically going to be\nsharing the workbook, and vice versa.\n\n55\n00:02:30.406 --> 00:02:35.488\nIf you share a workbook, then you're\nautomatically getting track changes,\n\n56\n00:02:35.488 --> 00:02:37.495\nokay, so they come together.\n\n57\n00:02:37.495 --> 00:02:43.420\nSo let's hop on down and get into\na file and go through the procedure.\n\n58\n00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.075\nI have a file called Track Changes,\nwhy don't we go ahead and open this, and\n\n59\n00:02:46.075 --> 00:02:47.624\nnothing's happened on this guy right now.\n\n60\n00:02:47.624 --> 00:02:50.461\nIt's not shared, it's not anything,\n\n61\n00:02:50.461 --> 00:02:55.228\nit's just a regular file that I\nwant to start tracking the changes.\n\n62\n00:02:55.228 --> 00:02:59.198\nAnd this is where we could just go ahead\nand turn the track changes on just for\n\n63\n00:02:59.198 --> 00:03:00.979\nour own purposes if we wanted to.\n\n64\n00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:04.248\nWe don't even have to go to the next\npoint of doing the whole uploading it to\n\n65\n00:03:04.248 --> 00:03:08.027\na OneDrive account, or putting it up on a\nnetwork share and having multiple people.\n\n66\n00:03:08.027 --> 00:03:12.617\nBut that's really probably what you'd\nwanna do with track changes when you're\n\n67\n00:03:12.617 --> 00:03:15.700\nworking with somebody other than yourself.\n\n68\n00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.410\nBut we're just gonna go through\nan example really quickly of just\n\n69\n00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.760\nkeeping it local with just us so we can\nstart demonstrating some of those topics.\n\n70\n00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.518\nAnd then I'll show you an example\nthat's already been done.\n\n71\n00:03:24.518 --> 00:03:27.919\nSo we're gonna come over here to Review,\nand\n\n72\n00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:32.767\nright here, Track Changes is\nnot available, why is that?\n\n73\n00:03:32.767 --> 00:03:36.323\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because of the one of the myriad of\n\n74\n00:03:36.323 --> 00:03:39.790\ncaveats that you can't actually\ntrack changes with it, right?\n\n75\n00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:40.547\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n76\n00:03:40.547 --> 00:03:41.300\nbecause the shared workbook?\n\n77\n00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.809\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n78\n00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:45.949\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that list, and between the\nepisodes we were talking, and it's like,\n\n79\n00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:48.369\nyou can't do merge cells in a-\n&gt;&gt; Have you have a first name?\n\n80\n00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:50.913\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, yeah,\n\n81\n00:03:50.913 --> 00:03:53.616\nthe limitations are pretty extensive.\n\n82\n00:03:53.616 --> 00:03:56.518\n[LAUGH] And so all the things that\nyou would normally wanna do in Excel,\n\n83\n00:03:56.518 --> 00:03:59.588\nthen you can't do it once it's shared,\nso it's like a little like ooh.\n\n84\n00:03:59.588 --> 00:04:03.547\nBut this is one of those examples\nbecause this is formatted as a table,\n\n85\n00:04:03.547 --> 00:04:05.841\nand I actually tried to look for the why.\n\n86\n00:04:05.841 --> 00:04:09.135\nWhy is this not supported, and\nall I got was it doesn't have it,\n\n87\n00:04:09.135 --> 00:04:11.458\nit's not supported, it's not supported.\n\n88\n00:04:11.458 --> 00:04:13.535\nI didn't get that but why, why?\n\n89\n00:04:13.535 --> 00:04:15.455\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, because do as I say,\n\n90\n00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:16.750\nnot as I do that's why, right?\n\n91\n00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.731\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] I am Microsoft,\n\n92\n00:04:18.731 --> 00:04:22.505\nI'm gonna tell you what to do [LAUGH] so\nit was just one of those type of things.\n\n93\n00:04:22.505 --> 00:04:27.207\nSo I couldn't get an actual reason,\nbut we'll just do the, okay.\n\n94\n00:04:27.207 --> 00:04:30.782\nSo we have here, we can convert\nthis table into a normal range, so\n\n95\n00:04:30.782 --> 00:04:32.613\nwe'll just go ahead and do that.\n\n96\n00:04:32.613 --> 00:04:36.092\nTalking about the end of that\nother episode, we're like,\n\n97\n00:04:36.092 --> 00:04:39.989\nyou have to determine what is more\nimportant to you, the sharing or\n\n98\n00:04:39.989 --> 00:04:42.580\nthe capabilities of your particular file.\n\n99\n00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.063\nSo now that I have it not as a table,\n\n100\n00:04:45.063 --> 00:04:49.707\nI'll come over here to our Review,\nand now I see Track Changes.\n\n101\n00:04:49.707 --> 00:04:53.399\nAnd this is like, okay keep track of\neverything, that's wonderful, great,\n\n102\n00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:54.182\ngreat, great.\n\n103\n00:04:54.182 --> 00:05:00.142\nGo into Highlight the Changes, and notice\nthat it says track changes while editing,\n\n104\n00:05:00.142 --> 00:05:02.975\nthis also shares your workbook, okay?\n\n105\n00:05:02.975 --> 00:05:07.115\nSo you can either turn on track changes,\nand then it makes it shared, or\n\n106\n00:05:07.115 --> 00:05:09.835\nmake it a share, and\nthen track your changes.\n\n107\n00:05:09.835 --> 00:05:14.630\nCuz it's, remember, it's automatically,\nyou don't have to do one or\n\n108\n00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.770\nthe other step, okay?\n\n109\n00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.960\nIt's all built into\nthe sharing capability,\n\n110\n00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.554\nthat's the whole meat and\npotatoes of this particular function.\n\n111\n00:05:24.554 --> 00:05:28.689\nSo I'll turn this on, and we'll come\nback to the when, where, who, and\n\n112\n00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:30.037\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n113\n00:05:30.037 --> 00:05:32.712\nAnd we're gonna turn the highlight off,\njust for a second, like I said,\n\n114\n00:05:32.712 --> 00:05:34.066\nI'll come back to it in a little bit.\n\n115\n00:05:34.066 --> 00:05:36.916\nIt's gonna say, well,\nnow let me go ahead and save my changes.\n\n116\n00:05:36.916 --> 00:05:42.130\nI click OK, and\nnow I know that it is shared, perfect.\n\n117\n00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.830\nSo now let's start doing some\nchanges to this particular workbook.\n\n118\n00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.430\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne, really quickly, it starts\ntracking changes from the time you turn it\n\n119\n00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.660\non, not changes that you've already\ndone up unto this point, correct?\n\n120\n00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.897\n&gt;&gt; If you had shared it-\n&gt;&gt; If I have shared it,\n\n121\n00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:58.022\nbecause sharing is so\ningrained with tracking.\n\n122\n00:05:58.022 --> 00:05:59.111\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna be tracking.\n\n123\n00:05:59.111 --> 00:05:59.750\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n124\n00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.586\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so that's where, and\nlet's actually do some for a second,\n\n125\n00:06:02.586 --> 00:06:06.252\nI'll come over into the Highlight, no,\nit's over here, in the Shared Workbooks.\n\n126\n00:06:06.252 --> 00:06:09.805\nCuz we were going through, in the other\nepisode, we did the Advance, sorry,\n\n127\n00:06:09.805 --> 00:06:10.602\nthe Editing tab.\n\n128\n00:06:10.602 --> 00:06:11.715\nThis right here,\n\n129\n00:06:11.715 --> 00:06:16.100\nnotice, it's already tracking your\nchanges as soon as you share it.\n\n130\n00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:21.260\nSo, yeah, maybe I shared it last week and\nnow we've been working on it.\n\n131\n00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.913\nIf I had come in and do the Highlight\nChanges, it's already logging that for me,\n\n132\n00:06:25.913 --> 00:06:27.900\nso that's why it's together.\n\n133\n00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.930\nThey are one and the same.\n\n134\n00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.060\nAnd you can see that it will keep for\n30 days, okay, and\n\n135\n00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.630\nthen when is it gonna be updated, when the\nfile saves and all that kind of fun stuff.\n\n136\n00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:43.405\nSo that's what you get with the sharing\ncapabilities, okay, so they're together.\n\n137\n00:06:43.405 --> 00:06:48.324\nCool, but now that I have went ahead and\nturned on the tracking and\n\n138\n00:06:48.324 --> 00:06:50.208\nshared it, same thing.\n\n139\n00:06:50.208 --> 00:06:54.024\nSo I've got the Alice,\nwe'll do a wonderland here, and\n\n140\n00:06:54.024 --> 00:06:58.830\nI will come over here and\nchange her phone number to 555-5555.\n\n141\n00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.210\nAnd this person is now\ngonna be on team pink, and\n\n142\n00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:04.350\nthis person's gonna be on team purple.\n\n143\n00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:08.390\nI will add another worksheet, well,\nlet's go ahead and select that, or\n\n144\n00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.540\nclick off &gt;

It does make sense.\n\n258\n00:12:48.413 --> 00:12:49.595\nIt's a little hard to follow,\n\n259\n00:12:49.595 --> 00:12:52.785\nbut if you're paying attention, it should\nmake sense to you as well, hopefully.\n\n260\n00:12:52.785 --> 00:12:54.765\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm like, wait, one, two, three,\n\n270\n00:13:15.538 --> 00:13:20.248\nit was the third step of the action, that\nwas the third action that that person did.\n\n271\n00:13:20.248 --> 00:13:23.446\nAnd then I rejected it,\nand so that was it, and\n\n272\n00:13:23.446 --> 00:13:28.128\nthen this is the value that it was before,\nI'm like, gotcha.\n\n273\n00:13:28.128 --> 00:13:33.387\n[LAUGH] So you can see these log files\nfrom here, and this was just from me.\n\n274\n00:13:33.387 --> 00:13:37.593\nAnd I wanna show you another file,\nand we can close this, and\n\n275\n00:13:37.593 --> 00:13:39.584\nwe can not save our changes.\n\n276\n00:13:39.584 --> 00:13:44.614\nI should have just closed the file and\nkept Excel open cuz I need to go out\n\n277\n00:13:44.614 --> 00:13:50.085\nto a file that is saved on our OneDrive\naccount that I have shared out to Joey.\n\n278\n00:13:50.085 --> 00:13:54.404\nAnd I think I actually shared it\nout to Lance on the last episode.\n\n279\n00:13:54.404 --> 00:13:58.727\nBut I've been doing some changes in here\ncuz, remember, it's a shared workbook, so\n\n280\n00:13:58.727 --> 00:14:00.880\nthe track changes are already on.\n\n281\n00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.860\nAnd we even did some in the last episode,\nso let's see what this one does.\n\n282\n00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:09.760\nCome over to Review, we go to our Track\nChanges, and we Highlight our Changes.\n\n283\n00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:13.858\nI wanna see everything, so\nI don't wanna do since the last save,\n\n284\n00:14:13.858 --> 00:14:17.599\nlet's go with all the changes\nfrom everyone that has this.\n\n285\n00:14:17.599 --> 00:14:22.201\nLet's also list all the changes\nin a new sheet, and we click OK.\n\n286\n00:14:22.201 --> 00:14:26.975\nSee now you can see a lot more on\nhere because this is where, and look,\n\n287\n00:14:26.975 --> 00:14:30.142\nJoey, it's not just me as JT,\nit's me as Joey.\n\n288\n00:14:30.142 --> 00:14:31.244\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's you as Joey.\n\n289\n00:14:31.244 --> 00:14:33.234\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so, and\n\n290\n00:14:33.234 --> 00:14:35.698\nI did the whole sending the email, and\n\n291\n00:14:35.698 --> 00:14:40.480\nyou saw that in the shared workbook\nepisode, to where Joey had an invite.\n\n292\n00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:45.110\nAnd so I can see all the things that Joey\ndid, and then everything that JT did.\n\n293\n00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:49.855\nAnd here's the new value, this was the old\nvalue, where was it, what sheet was it in.\n\n294\n00:14:49.855 --> 00:14:52.952\nSee, remember Fuego needs, yes he does.\n\n295\n00:14:52.952 --> 00:14:56.114\nThat's what we just did\nin the last episode, so\n\n296\n00:14:56.114 --> 00:15:00.236\nit's tracking everything that Joey did and\nwhat JT had done.\n\n297\n00:15:00.236 --> 00:15:05.206\nSo, pretty neat that you can go\nthrough this, and then, yes, go back,\n\n298\n00:15:05.206 --> 00:15:09.786\nas the owner of this, I do the accept or\nreject through all of this.\n\n299\n00:15:09.786 --> 00:15:13.910\nAnd I can go back through it,\nso it's pretty neat.\n\n300\n00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:16.320\nDo remember that with this tracking,\n\n301\n00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:21.580\nif you're gonna put on Track\nChanges/Shared Workbook, if you don't want\n\n302\n00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:26.437\nJoey to be able to turn this off,\nit's like, [LAUGH] I don't need\n\n303\n00:15:26.437 --> 00:15:32.080\nyou to track what I'm doing, Joey has\nthe right to unshare this workbook.\n\n304\n00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:37.053\nSo before you do it, and that was in that\nlast episode, is that you would need\n\n305\n00:15:37.053 --> 00:15:42.059\nto protect and share, slash, also\ninclude track changes before you do it.\n\n306\n00:15:42.059 --> 00:15:46.297\nAnd then password protect that to make\nsure that other people can't turn this\n\n307\n00:15:46.297 --> 00:15:49.031\nfeature off because,\nwe talked about at the end,\n\n308\n00:15:49.031 --> 00:15:52.503\nyou wanna make sure you keep\nthe integrity of that data intact.\n\n309\n00:15:52.503 --> 00:15:57.088\nAnd so locking stuff down is\nthe best way to make sure nobody\n\n310\n00:15:57.088 --> 00:15:59.060\nmesses with your stuff.\n\n311\n00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:00.084\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So,\n\n312\n00:16:00.084 --> 00:16:04.531\ntrack changes really powerful,\nreally handy.\n\n313\n00:16:04.531 --> 00:16:08.293\nAgain, do you need just\ndetermine is the tracking and\n\n314\n00:16:08.293 --> 00:16:12.222\nthe sharing more important\nthan formatting as tables,\n\n315\n00:16:12.222 --> 00:16:16.663\nmerging cells, conditional formats,\nall that kinda staff.\n\n316\n00:16:16.663 --> 00:16:21.611\nBut I can definitely see scenarios for\nboth of them like, yes share,\n\n317\n00:16:21.611 --> 00:16:23.757\nno share, so on and so forth.\n\n318\n00:16:23.757 --> 00:16:27.040\nSo I hope you've enjoyed track changes,\nand that's all I've got.\n\n319\n00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:30.290\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne, I do believe you earned\nthat really cool tracksuit and Kangol,\n\n320\n00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:32.445\nI might even throw a dookie\nchain in there for good measure.\n\n321\n00:16:32.445 --> 00:16:33.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes.\n&gt;&gt; You're\n\n322\n00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:34.790\nawesome cuz that was a great episode.\n\n323\n00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:38.266\nWe really appreciate you showing us how we\ncan look through these changes as we track\n\n324\n00:16:38.266 --> 00:16:39.119\nthem and turn it on.\n\n325\n00:16:39.119 --> 00:16:42.332\nThat it's basically integrated in\nwith the whole sharing feature, so\n\n326\n00:16:42.332 --> 00:16:44.909\nif you're doing one,\nyou're gonna be doing the other.\n\n327\n00:16:44.909 --> 00:16:47.350\nIt's all gonna be built in together.\n\n328\n00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:50.080\nVery cool stuff,\nwe do appreciate that, but looks like\n\n329\n00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.610\nwe're at the end of our episode,\nladies and gentlemen, thanks for watching.\n\n330\n00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:55.840\nDefinitely come back for more,\nwe got plenty of Excel to come, but as for\n\n331\n00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:56.990\nthis one, it's time to sign-off.\n\n332\n00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:59.470\nFor OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n333\n00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:00.380\n&gt;&gt;

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.070\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode, well guess what?\n\n4\n00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.422\nWe're back with more in\nExcel 2016 Advanced series.\n\n5\n00:00:16.422 --> 00:00:19.452\nIt's been a lot of fun so far, so we're\njust gonna keep on moving forward with it\n\n6\n00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:21.184\nuntil we've got nothing\nleft to talk about.\n\n7\n00:00:21.184 --> 00:00:24.785\nAnd joining us back in the studio\nto help us deplete those words,\n\n8\n00:00:24.785 --> 00:00:26.605\nour good friend Ms Vonne Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:26.605 --> 00:00:28.598\nVonne, welcome to the show,\nhow's it going today?\n\n10\n00:00:28.598 --> 00:00:29.572\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm over here\ntrying not to laugh.\n\n11\n00:00:29.572 --> 00:00:31.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm not sure if we'll\n\n12\n00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.335\never run out of anything\nto talk about here.\n\n13\n00:00:33.335 --> 00:00:34.062\nEspecially between you and me.\n\n14\n00:00:34.062 --> 00:00:35.827\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] we talk.\n\n15\n00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:38.901\n&gt;&gt; And really, Excel, I mean,\nwe could teach this for-\n\n16\n00:00:38.901 --> 00:00:39.484\n&gt;&gt; Kind of extensive.\n\n17\n00:00:39.484 --> 00:00:40.360\n&gt;&gt; Forever.\n\n18\n00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.290\n[LAUGH] It is a very extensive product and\ncan be doing a lot.\n\n19\n00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.630\nBut we're gonna keep it\na little basic here.\n\n20\n00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.203\nI mean,\neven though we're in our advanced series,\n\n21\n00:00:49.203 --> 00:00:52.345\nwe're just trying to keep\nit above-ground right now.\n\n22\n00:00:52.345 --> 00:00:54.397\nAnd get us onto these\ndifferent concepts and\n\n23\n00:00:54.397 --> 00:00:57.568\njust get that kinda confidential\nknowledge as to what we need to do.\n\n24\n00:00:57.568 --> 00:01:01.201\nAnd in this episode we're going to\nbe talking about data validation,\n\n25\n00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:02.502\nwhich can be a lot of fun.\n\n26\n00:01:02.502 --> 00:01:07.972\nNow I went head and put this is in\nthe Collaborate and Security topic area.\n\n27\n00:01:07.972 --> 00:01:12.105\nBecause these would be things that you\nwould want to probably do when you're\n\n28\n00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:15.290\nworking with a workbook\nwith multiple people.\n\n29\n00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.899\nIt's up on a share drive, and maybe,\ncuz we've talked about shared workbooks,\n\n30\n00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:21.999\nwe've talked about tracked changes,\nand all that kind of fun stuff.\n\n31\n00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:25.021\nWell, this is kind of taking\nit to the next level of,\n\n32\n00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:29.626\nwell what if I wanna make sure that people\nonly put in the departments that we have\n\n33\n00:01:29.626 --> 00:01:34.390\nin our organization, and they're not\nmaking up their own departments?\n\n34\n00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.870\nLike I'm the department of\n\n35\n00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.235\nRedundancy Department-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n36\n00:01:37.235 --> 00:01:39.113\n&gt;&gt; And that's just the one I'm going to\n\n37\n00:01:39.113 --> 00:01:40.756\nlive in, cuz I live there a lot.\n\n38\n00:01:40.756 --> 00:01:43.748\n[LAUGH] But that doesn't exist\nin our organization, so-\n\n39\n00:01:43.748 --> 00:01:44.996\n&gt;&gt; You can't look at the org chart and\n\n40\n00:01:44.996 --> 00:01:48.195\nfind the Department of Redundancy or the\nRedundant Department of Redundancy, right?\n\n41\n00:01:48.195 --> 00:01:51.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly,\nyou're just gonna keep on making a circle.\n\n42\n00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.355\n&gt;&gt; See other department.\n\n43\n00:01:52.355 --> 00:01:55.112\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, and\naround and around and around.\n\n44\n00:01:55.112 --> 00:01:58.215\nYeah, but that's where,\nhey, if I want me, others,\n\n45\n00:01:58.215 --> 00:02:01.322\nwhoever that's working in\nthis particular workbook,\n\n46\n00:02:01.322 --> 00:02:06.227\nto only be able to choose from marketing,\nadvertising, human resources, and sales.\n\n47\n00:02:06.227 --> 00:02:08.320\nI think that's what we've been doing\nin our Christmas cats example.\n\n48\n00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.117\nWell, make a little drop down.\n\n49\n00:02:10.117 --> 00:02:12.770\nWell, when you think about that,\nthat's validating\n\n50\n00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.230\nthe type of data that goes into there,\nthey can't choose anything but that.\n\n51\n00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.630\nThat would be pretty cool.\n\n52\n00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.630\nWhat if I wanted it to say the text\nlength needs to be five characters,\n\n53\n00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.260\nlike for ZIP codes?\n\n54\n00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.200\nOr I need to make sure that this\nparticular column doesn't accept decimals.\n\n55\n00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.280\nAll those different things, you can think\nabout all these different scenarios of why\n\n56\n00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.070\nyou'd want to validate the data\nthat is going into there.\n\n57\n00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.454\nAnd then you can kind\nof secure down areas of\n\n58\n00:02:40.454 --> 00:02:44.685\nyour workbook to only allow\ncertain types of things.\n\n59\n00:02:44.685 --> 00:02:48.975\nSo why don't I give you an example and\nshow you how it works, and then we'll go\n\n60\n00:02:48.975 --> 00:02:52.870\nthrough about how do we actually\nrecreate that within this workbook.\n\n61\n00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.830\nSo I've got a file called Data Validation,\nwe've got a worksheet called\n\n62\n00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.560\nData Validation Example so\nyou can get the idea.\n\n63\n00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.250\nSo let's say that we are here, and\n\n64\n00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.370\nin our item number, that's the wrong key,\nhow about we go here.\n\n65\n00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.840\nOur item numbers,\nthey can only be whole numbers,\n\n66\n00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.400\nthey can't be Item 2.5 or\n3.6, it has to be that.\n\n67\n00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.310\nSo what I have done here is\nI've actually created data\n\n68\n00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.200\nvalidation on this particular column.\n\n69\n00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.731\nSo if I type in 5, no problem.\n\n70\n00:03:21.731 --> 00:03:27.556\n2, no problem, 1.5, nope,\nyour not allowed to do this.\n\n71\n00:03:27.556 --> 00:03:32.450\nThis value doesn't match the data\nvalidation restrictions defined the cell.\n\n72\n00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.640\nWould you like to retry?\n\n73\n00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.820\nSure I'll like to try again.\n\n74\n00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.087\nAnd then I do 6.9, and\nnope you can't do that.\n\n75\n00:03:38.087 --> 00:03:43.210\n[LAUGH] But see it won't even accept it,\nit's like no, you can do that.\n\n76\n00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.165\nSo if I say 6, okay there we go.\n\n77\n00:03:46.165 --> 00:03:51.372\nSo it's nice that I'm being\nforced to put in a whole number,\n\n78\n00:03:51.372 --> 00:03:54.203\nand that is-\n&gt;&gt; Does that work with\n\n79\n00:03:54.203 --> 00:03:57.000\nletters as well as as numbers?\n\n80\n00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.340\nSo if I tried to put\na instead of a whole number,\n\n81\n00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.100\nwould that also give me that crazy,\nthere you go.\n\n82\n00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n[LAUGH] Yes totally, and\n\n83\n00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:10.431\nbecause I'm saying that, and this isn't\njust the number formatting necessarily.\n\n84\n00:04:10.431 --> 00:04:14.773\nBecause we talked about formatting\ncells where I could say, all right,\n\n85\n00:04:14.773 --> 00:04:17.515\nthis is going to be seen as text or\nas numbers.\n\n86\n00:04:17.515 --> 00:04:19.090\nWe've talked about those types of things.\n\n87\n00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.885\nIt is that one step further of like, well,\nno, cuz I could format this as numbers but\n\n88\n00:04:22.885 --> 00:04:25.462\nthen put in text,\nit's never going to give me a warning.\n\n89\n00:04:25.462 --> 00:04:28.917\nSo it takes it to the next level,\nso yes, that is exactly true.\n\n90\n00:04:28.917 --> 00:04:31.700\nAll right, so now I've got over here,\nlook at this, seize the day.\n\n91\n00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.855\nAll right, wonderful, so it's actually\ngiving me a little tip in here,\n\n92\n00:04:36.855 --> 00:04:40.946\nan input tip that says date\nmust be after 7/24/17.\n\n93\n00:04:40.946 --> 00:04:45.099\nCool, so let's go ahead and do 8/24/17.\n\n94\n00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:47.330\nWhoops, no problems.\n\n95\n00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:53.310\nMaybe I do 1-1-1, and then that's\nstill giving me, that's allowing.\n\n96\n00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.700\nThat shouldn't happen,\nbut let's try this again.\n\n97\n00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.085\nAll right, well this isn't working.\n\n98\n00:05:01.085 --> 00:05:05.310\n[LAUGH] But it's supposed to go ahead and\ngive you a warning that says no,\n\n99\n00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.830\nno, no, you're not allowed to do that.\n\n100\n00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.160\nAnd I'm well, you know what?\n\n101\n00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.287\n&gt;&gt; You get to troubleshoot your own.\n\n102\n00:05:12.287 --> 00:05:13.199\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right we are,\n\n103\n00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.720\nwe're gonna have to totally troubleshoot\nwhy isn't this giving me a problem?\n\n104\n00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.857\nThat's okay, we'll come back around.\n\n105\n00:05:17.857 --> 00:05:18.523\n&gt;&gt; We'll come to it, yeah.\n\n106\n00:05:18.523 --> 00:05:22.068\n&gt;&gt; All right, but we've got the one part\nwhere it gives you an input value of hey,\n\n107\n00:05:22.068 --> 00:05:23.424\nyou're supposed to do this.\n\n108\n00:05:23.424 --> 00:05:25.620\nAll right,\nlet's pretend like that didn't happen.\n\n109\n00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:26.594\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Keep on moving down and\n\n110\n00:05:26.594 --> 00:05:28.050\nthen we'll come back around\nto see what happened.\n\n111\n00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.103\nI think I just did a Department\nof Redundancy Department.\n\n112\n00:05:31.103 --> 00:05:33.835\n&gt;&gt; You sure did.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Circle circle.\n\n113\n00:05:33.835 --> 00:05:37.150\nAll right, so now I've got here,\nnow this one I do know works.\n\n114\n00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.370\nRight here, that drop down, look,\n\n115\n00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.850\nthese are the only departments\nthat I can choose from.\n\n116\n00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.676\nSo let's go with Human Resources.\n\n117\n00:05:44.676 --> 00:05:49.209\nIf I came in here and typed in\nSocial Media, I'm just typing this in,\n\n118\n00:05:49.209 --> 00:05:54.072\nit's going to say, no, there's a drop\ndown, it's there for a reason.\n\n119\n00:05:54.072 --> 00:05:55.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's there for a reason.\n\n120\n00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.310\nDid you type that in, or\ndoes it say that by default?\n\n121\n00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.594\nCuz if it does, good on you, Microsoft.\n\n122\n00:05:59.594 --> 00:06:02.468\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No that's a custom error.\n\n123\n00:06:02.468 --> 00:06:03.004\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n124\n00:06:03.004 --> 00:06:05.000\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and that's where\n\n125\n00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.980\nthere's supposed to be one on that date\nthat basically says something like,\n\n126\n00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.020\ndid you not read the input?\n\n127\n00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.840\nSo yes,\nI was trying to get to that whole idea of\n\n128\n00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.570\nyeah you can customize\nthe warnings that happens in here.\n\n129\n00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.460\nSo retry, note you can't type it in.\n\n130\n00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.950\nOkay, I'm sorry, let me go ahead and\ndrop this down, and\n\n131\n00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.484\neverything will work on its way,\nso that's a pretty cool thing.\n\n132\n00:06:28.484 --> 00:06:33.916\nNow ZIP codes are five digits so, 12345.\n\n133\n00:06:33.916 --> 00:06:39.825\nOkay, 1234567, no, the value does not\nmatch, and so that's the default one.\n\n134\n00:06:39.825 --> 00:06:43.285\nWhere it's just nicely saying\nit does not match the data\n\n135\n00:06:43.285 --> 00:06:44.145\nvalidation restriction there.\n\n136\n00:06:44.145 --> 00:06:46.900\n&gt;&gt; It would be so funny if Microsoft\ndecides, we're going to throw some serious\n\n137\n00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.315\nshade [LAUGH] for\npeople that make mistakes from now on.\n\n138\n00:06:50.315 --> 00:06:51.975\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's where,\nI mean you could.\n\n139\n00:06:51.975 --> 00:06:53.800\n&gt;&gt; To shame you into doing it right.\n\n140\n00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.103\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And those are one of those,\n\n141\n00:06:56.103 --> 00:06:58.597\nif you are sending pretty mean messages,\n\n142\n00:06:58.597 --> 00:07:01.958\nyou might have to talk to\nthe HR department at one point.\n\n143\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:06.260\nBut yeah, you can create your different\nmessages there, so that's the idea here.\n\n144\n00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.960\nBut with the, let me try again.\n\n145\n00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.650\nOkay it's not gonna give me any\nother options, but it says no.\n\n146\n00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:16.788\nThe thing on this particular one,\nif I typed in Vonne, that's totally fine,\n\n147\n00:07:16.788 --> 00:07:20.175\nbecause it's a text length,\nand it's only five characters.\n\n148\n00:07:20.175 --> 00:07:21.820\nSo now on this one it's\na little different,\n\n149\n00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:26.230\nbecause it's not a number,\nI'm only allowing five numbers.\n\n150\n00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:28.520\nI'm now just allowing five characters,\n\n151\n00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.010\nwhich could include text or numbers,\nso it's some different ones.\n\n152\n00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:37.070\nSo pretty neat how you could go ahead and\nlimit those types of inputs.\n\n153\n00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.910\nNow, what about if I came\nin here after the fact?\n\n154\n00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:45.148\nSo here we have some information on this\nworksheet that has the number of items and\n\n155\n00:07:45.148 --> 00:07:47.930\nthe date and the ZIP codes and everything.\n\n156\n00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:55.399\nI wanna be able to circle the invalid\ndates based on my particular condition.\n\n157\n00:07:55.399 --> 00:07:56.838\nSo let me show you what I mean.\n\n158\n00:07:56.838 --> 00:07:58.908\nLet's come over here to the Data tab.\n\n159\n00:07:58.908 --> 00:08:03.168\nAnd on the Data tab, you've got this\nbutton right over here in the Data tools.\n\n160\n00:08:03.168 --> 00:08:05.410\nAnd you might actually\nsee some text next to it,\n\n161\n00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:07.610\ndepending on the resolution\nof your monitor.\n\n162\n00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.940\nSo all the rules that I was going\nthrough were on that Data Validation.\n\n163\n00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:16.170\nAnd then the Circle Invalid Data,\nthis is where,\n\n164\n00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:19.070\nif you select your information and\nput those validation rules on it,\n\n165\n00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:23.320\nyou can go ahead and\nhave it tell you which ones are wrong.\n\n166\n00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.730\nSo let me show you how it works.\n\n167\n00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:29.180\nNow, this is on items that are already\ndone and then we're doing the circling.\n\n168\n00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.660\nSo I'm gonna select these\nfour cells right here.\n\n169\n00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.960\nWe're gonna come into the Data Validation,\nand we're gonna say all right,\n\n170\n00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:35.650\nwell here we go.\n\n171\n00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:40.000\nThere are three different tabs on\nthis Data Validation dialogue box.\n\n172\n00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.740\nThe settings,\n\n173\n00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:45.620\nwhat is your criteria, the input message,\nthat was that little tooltip that came\n\n174\n00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:50.380\nup with the date that saying you have go\nahead and put in this particular format.\n\n175\n00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:52.570\nAnd then the error message,\n\n176\n00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:56.120\nthat's the one where you could go ahead\nstart creating your custom error messages.\n\n177\n00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:02.120\nDepending on whether you wanted to have\nthe little red x or the yellow warning or\n\n178\n00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.280\nthe information button,\nwhichever one you want as your icon.\n\n179\n00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.140\nSo let's come back over here to\nthe settings, what are we going to allow?\n\n180\n00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:13.620\nAnd you can see in this drop-down, any\nvalue, whole number, decimal, list, date,\n\n181\n00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.180\ntime, text length, and custom.\n\n182\n00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.890\nWe're gonna stick with some\nof the basic ones, and so\n\n183\n00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:23.490\nright here we're gonna say that I\nwould like these to be whole numbers.\n\n184\n00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:28.050\nNow you have some other options here, do\nthey have to be between a specific range,\n\n185\n00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:32.050\nmaybe you only have item\nnumbers six through ten.\n\n186\n00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:35.080\nSo you have to go ahead and do a between.\n\n187\n00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:40.010\nOn this one we might go ahead and\ndo it has to be greater then 0.\n\n188\n00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:42.603\nYou can physically type in 0.\n\n189\n00:09:42.603 --> 00:09:43.966\nNow this box down here,\n\n190\n00:09:43.966 --> 00:09:47.509\nyou're gonna see where you can\ngo out onto your worksheets and\n\n191\n00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:52.227\nbe able to pull data from those cells as\nyour different criteria from within here.\n\n192\n00:09:52.227 --> 00:09:56.824\nBut we're gonna just physically type in\nit has to be greater than 0, we click OK.\n\n193\n00:09:56.824 --> 00:10:00.790\nNow you're like, well,\nit's not giving me any problems right now.\n\n194\n00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:03.860\nRemember, this is data that's\nalready inputted into here.\n\n195\n00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.937\nBut if I go in to circle the invalid data,\nthere we go.\n\n196\n00:10:06.937 --> 00:10:07.473\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n197\n00:10:07.473 --> 00:10:08.890\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n198\n00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:11.420\nSo at least you can go through and\ncheck it.\n\n199\n00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:15.210\nSo think about this as we're\ngonna do the example of,\n\n200\n00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:18.005\nbefore you actually are able\nto put in the information.\n\n201\n00:10:18.005 --> 00:10:20.720\nThe information's already in there,\nlet me go ahead and\n\n202\n00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.240\nset my criteria and\ntell me where the problems are.\n\n203\n00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:27.450\nSo this is where we're doing the kind of\nit's already been done type of thing.\n\n204\n00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:28.800\nAnd so you can go with that.\n\n205\n00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.220\nIf I wanted to take this zip code and\nsay let's go ahead and\n\n206\n00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:37.770\ndo that it needs to be a text\nlength that is equal to five.\n\n207\n00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.090\nClick OK, there you go.\n\n208\n00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:45.100\nBecause that circling, that I want\nyou to circle any invalid data,\n\n209\n00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.230\nit's for the whole worksheet right now.\n\n210\n00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:50.230\nBecause I didn't have to go back and\nsay now circle it.\n\n211\n00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:53.037\nIt knew that we were doing that because\nof this particular criteria put on\n\n212\n00:10:53.037 --> 00:10:53.596\nthese cells.\n\n213\n00:10:53.596 --> 00:10:58.498\nSame with this, if I said that I wanted\n\n214\n00:10:58.498 --> 00:11:03.552\nto see my Data Validation that a date has\n\n215\n00:11:03.552 --> 00:11:08.310\nto be greater than 7/24/17.\n\n216\n00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:10.842\nClick OK, there are my errors.\n\n217\n00:11:10.842 --> 00:11:14.760\nSo at least you have that option of being\nable to see where your problems are.\n\n218\n00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.889\nSo this is where kind of back in our\nwhole topic of the Track Changes,\n\n219\n00:11:18.889 --> 00:11:20.271\nthe Data Validation.\n\n220\n00:11:20.271 --> 00:11:22.755\nYou could put all of\nthis on the same thing,\n\n221\n00:11:22.755 --> 00:11:26.810\nyou could do the Data Validation and\nyour Track Changes.\n\n222\n00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:29.410\nBut then the Data Validation's kind\nof controlling what they're gonna\n\n223\n00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:30.930\nbe putting in there anyways.\n\n224\n00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:34.450\nAnyways, you get to pick and choose which\nones are going to work best for you.\n\n225\n00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:40.520\nSo let's go ahead and do a few more of\nthose examples on this particular one.\n\n226\n00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.050\nLet's do this date one.\n\n227\n00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:47.860\nNow I want every single column,\nevery single cell within this column,\n\n228\n00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:53.190\nto be formatted that it has to\nbe greater than today's date,\n\n229\n00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:54.650\nwhich right now it is July 24th.\n\n230\n00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:59.206\nNow I don't want you to say today as in\ntomorrow it will be greater than 25, and\n\n231\n00:11:59.206 --> 00:12:00.364\ngreater than 27.\n\n232\n00:12:00.364 --> 00:12:03.382\nWow, I just did a skip of days [LAUGH].\n\n233\n00:12:03.382 --> 00:12:06.417\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There are ways that you can do that,\n\n234\n00:12:06.417 --> 00:12:09.680\nit does involve using some time and\ndate functions.\n\n235\n00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:13.992\nNow functions, like actual formulas,\nnot too terribly difficult.\n\n236\n00:12:13.992 --> 00:12:16.797\nBut since we're trying to\nkeep these formulas and\n\n237\n00:12:16.797 --> 00:12:20.620\neverything separate out of this,\njust know that that is possible.\n\n238\n00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.179\nCuz that's where my mind would go, well,\nI need it to be greater than today's date,\n\n239\n00:12:23.179 --> 00:12:23.834\nwhatever date it is.\n\n240\n00:12:23.834 --> 00:12:26.413\nSo it's out there.\n\n241\n00:12:26.413 --> 00:12:27.999\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's out there.\n&gt;&gt; We'll make another episode\n\n242\n00:12:27.999 --> 00:12:30.090\nsomewhere along the way on that one.\n\n243\n00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:31.555\nSo on this one,\nwe're just doing a set date.\n\n244\n00:12:31.555 --> 00:12:35.369\nNow I need to make every single one, so\nsome of our little selection techniques,\n\n245\n00:12:35.369 --> 00:12:38.284\nI'm gonna hold my Shift key,\nI'm gonna hold my Ctrl key, and\n\n246\n00:12:38.284 --> 00:12:40.030\nthen hit the down arrow key.\n\n247\n00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:45.180\nBecause that selects the entire column,\nbut not that first cell.\n\n248\n00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:48.330\nBecause this isn't a date,\nit's my column header.\n\n249\n00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.100\nSo I don't want that to have\nmy Data Validation on it.\n\n250\n00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:56.959\nSo let's come back over and say that\nthe value is going to be the date,\n\n251\n00:12:56.959 --> 00:13:02.164\nis going to be greater than\ntoday's date right now,\n\n252\n00:13:02.164 --> 00:13:05.500\nas in July 24th, and click OK.\n\n253\n00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.479\nI just wanna make sure it's going to work,\ncuz that last one didn't work.\n\n254\n00:13:09.479 --> 00:13:12.163\n1-1-1, there you go.\n\n255\n00:13:12.163 --> 00:13:13.950\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n256\n00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:16.670\n&gt;&gt; I must have taken the validation\noff before I saved the file or\n\n257\n00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:17.440\nsomething like that.\n\n258\n00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.707\nThis is what should be happening.\n\n259\n00:13:18.707 --> 00:13:21.800\nAnd then it's like, well, try it again.\n\n260\n00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.910\nTry it again and\nthen we can go ahead and find that.\n\n261\n00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:28.717\nNow if I did 12-24-17,\nthat's all fantastic.\n\n262\n00:13:28.717 --> 00:13:31.098\nThis is where maybe we should go ahead and\n\n263\n00:13:31.098 --> 00:13:34.331\nmake some of those custom\nvalidation warning things.\n\n264\n00:13:34.331 --> 00:13:36.809\nWhere it's like, did you not pay\nattention to what I just told you?\n\n265\n00:13:36.809 --> 00:13:38.419\nBut we'll try and say it nicer.\n\n266\n00:13:38.419 --> 00:13:41.529\nBut between the two of us,\nwe probably won't [LAUGH].\n\n267\n00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:43.263\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we have this here, so\n\n268\n00:13:43.263 --> 00:13:44.963\nI've selected the columns again.\n\n269\n00:13:44.963 --> 00:13:48.651\nCome back into that Data Validation,\nI have the criteria,\n\n270\n00:13:48.651 --> 00:13:50.508\nlet's do the input message.\n\n271\n00:13:50.508 --> 00:13:53.596\nSo let's go ahead and title this, hey!\n\n272\n00:13:53.596 --> 00:13:58.396\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think we'll stop there [LAUGH].\n\n273\n00:13:58.396 --> 00:14:04.204\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Must be later\nthan 7-24 [LAUGH].\n\n274\n00:14:04.204 --> 00:14:11.450\nThere are all sorts of problem in that,\n[LAUGH], wow, okay.\n\n275\n00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:15.616\nAt the time of this recording\nit is a Monday right now.\n\n276\n00:14:15.616 --> 00:14:16.221\n&gt;&gt; It is a Monday.\n\n277\n00:14:16.221 --> 00:14:18.728\n&gt;&gt; It's like, [SOUND],\nlet's get back on our horse.\n\n278\n00:14:18.728 --> 00:14:21.654\nWe're going over here to our error alert,\nso\n\n279\n00:14:21.654 --> 00:14:24.738\nlet's go ahead and\nwe can give it information.\n\n280\n00:14:24.738 --> 00:14:27.765\n&gt;&gt; Can I put a contemptuous face emoticon?\n\n281\n00:14:27.765 --> 00:14:30.263\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know what, I bet you with VBA,\n\n282\n00:14:30.263 --> 00:14:32.440\nI'm sure that's the answer to everything.\n\n283\n00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.920\nBut on this one we'll just go with stop,\nand-\n\n284\n00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:36.017\n&gt;&gt; Can we make it hack with NASA?\n\n285\n00:14:36.017 --> 00:14:38.178\nWith VBA, yeah, it'll hack NASA [LAUGH].\n\n286\n00:14:38.178 --> 00:14:41.622\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Like, HHEEEEEEYYYY,\n\n287\n00:14:41.622 --> 00:14:46.038\ndid you not see the message?????\n\n288\n00:14:46.038 --> 00:14:48.394\n[LAUGH] Dude [LAUGH].\n\n289\n00:14:48.394 --> 00:14:50.890\n&gt;&gt; Dude [LAUGH].\n\n290\n00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:54.245\n&gt;&gt; So, you can go ahead-\n&gt;&gt; Seriously?\n\n291\n00:14:54.245 --> 00:14:55.798\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Seriously [LAUGH].\n\n292\n00:14:55.798 --> 00:14:57.007\n&gt;&gt; So, you should just make it say,\nseriously.\n\n293\n00:14:57.007 --> 00:14:58.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And then we've got that.\n\n294\n00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:05.399\nSo, hey, must be later 1-1-1,\ndid you not see the message?\n\n295\n00:15:05.399 --> 00:15:10.123\n[LAUGH] So you can have a little bit of\nfun with some of those error messages\n\n296\n00:15:10.123 --> 00:15:12.450\nuntil somebody complains [LAUGH].\n\n297\n00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:15.228\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're probably gonna\nsee one of those departments, and\n\n298\n00:15:15.228 --> 00:15:16.753\nit's most likely called HR [LAUGH].\n\n299\n00:15:16.753 --> 00:15:18.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH] exactly.\n\n300\n00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:22.090\nSo now the drop-downs,\nnow where did mine come from?\n\n301\n00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:25.660\nCuz I actually kinda combined\na couple different things in here.\n\n302\n00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:30.393\nCuz the thing with the drop-down list, and\nthat's what a lot of people love to use in\n\n303\n00:15:30.393 --> 00:15:33.542\nData Validation is you have\nto pick one of these values.\n\n304\n00:15:33.542 --> 00:15:37.361\nYou have to create the list\nsomewhere in your workbook to\n\n305\n00:15:37.361 --> 00:15:40.210\nbe able to pull the data from.\n\n306\n00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:43.821\nThe other thing is, if you think about or\nif I put that on another sheet,\n\n307\n00:15:43.821 --> 00:15:47.512\nI don't want somebody going and\nfinding that list and then changing it.\n\n308\n00:15:47.512 --> 00:15:51.912\nCuz that kinda defeats the whole\npurpose of me as an owner limiting\n\n309\n00:15:51.912 --> 00:15:53.434\nwhat they can do to it.\n\n310\n00:15:53.434 --> 00:15:57.710\nWhere mine is, it's like where\ndid you get all these things?\n\n311\n00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:00.910\nThere's a hidden worksheet in here,\nooh remember that?\n\n312\n00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:04.050\nSo if you right click somewhere\ndown in worksheet tab and\n\n313\n00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:08.330\ngo to unhide see look at that I've\nhidden a sheet called hide values.\n\n314\n00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:11.231\nWe click okay then I come here,\nwell I found it.\n\n315\n00:16:11.231 --> 00:16:11.982\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n316\n00:16:11.982 --> 00:16:13.295\npeople could do that,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n317\n00:16:13.295 --> 00:16:14.832\n&gt;&gt; They know about how to find sheets.\n\n318\n00:16:14.832 --> 00:16:15.545\nYou can go there.\n\n319\n00:16:15.545 --> 00:16:18.437\nAnd then they come into here like,\nperfect I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n320\n00:16:18.437 --> 00:16:20.030\nmake this a social media.\n\n321\n00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:22.550\nWell what did that just do?\n\n322\n00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:25.030\nWell what I did is one step further,\nis I locked those cells.\n\n323\n00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:25.940\n&gt;&gt; Aha.\n\n324\n00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:30.070\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and I put a password protection\non this particular worksheet that says\n\n325\n00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:32.220\neven if you find it,\nyou can't get into it.\n\n326\n00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:34.460\n&gt;&gt; Out comes the password crackers.\n\n327\n00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:35.240\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, and\n\n328\n00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.030\nI will show you how I did this,\nbut I wanted to kinda combine it.\n\n329\n00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:41.830\nBecause we do have another\nepisode called Document Security\n\n330\n00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:44.290\nto where we go over a couple of\ndifferent things including this.\n\n331\n00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.010\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n332\n00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:50.440\nBut since I have got this already here,\n\n333\n00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.480\nand I'm gonna come over\nhere to the Review tab.\n\n334\n00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.460\nAnd I'm going to unprotect the sheet.\n\n335\n00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.140\nKind of, a little foreshadowing here,\n\n336\n00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.756\nthat's where you can go\nto protect the sheet.\n\n337\n00:16:58.756 --> 00:16:59.617\nUh-oh.\n\n338\n00:16:59.617 --> 00:17:03.580\nUh-oh, what did I do with my password.\n\n339\n00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:04.980\nI thought it was apple.\n\n340\n00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:06.180\nI always do apple.\n\n341\n00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:07.590\nYou know what, let's try the other one.\n\n342\n00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:11.140\nIf it's not apple, it's orange, orange?\n\n343\n00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:11.910\nNo.\n\n344\n00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:12.600\nHey guess what?\n\n345\n00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.716\nI don't know what the password is so\nunprotect this sheet.\n\n346\n00:17:15.716 --> 00:17:18.340\n&gt;&gt; So security Vonne can't get in.\n\n347\n00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:19.040\n&gt;&gt; I know right.\n\n348\n00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:22.050\nI had the caps locks on\nwhen I made the password.\n\n349\n00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:24.470\nIt's all right, okay, yay!\n\n350\n00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:26.970\nI'm like, I never do anything but\napple and orange.\n\n351\n00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:28.620\nSo, I guess I did have that on.\n\n352\n00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:29.490\nSo, all right.\n\n353\n00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:32.820\nSo let's pretend that is in the sheet\nthat I've already created which\n\n354\n00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:35.080\nlet's not pretend I actually did it.\n\n355\n00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:40.650\nWe have our values here, I want to be\nable to create this as my drop down for\n\n356\n00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:45.590\nthis particular worksheet that we're\ndoing on the data validation create.\n\n357\n00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:49.690\nSo let's do that shift command,\nor sorry, control,\n\n358\n00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:55.180\nI'm in Windows, so shift command down,\nget everything selected.\n\n359\n00:17:55.180 --> 00:18:00.310\nCome on up\n&gt;&gt; Now I'm gonna go into my Data tab,\n\n360\n00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:03.050\ngo into the Data Validation.\n\n361\n00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:08.410\nWe'll go to Settings and\nwe'll go with List, perfect.\n\n362\n00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:14.190\nSo I want all these cells to be\nformatted or restricted to a list.\n\n363\n00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:16.150\nI'm gonna have to go with the source.\n\n364\n00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:17.730\nNow you're gonna click\nin your cursor there.\n\n365\n00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:22.710\nYou're gonna click the button to accept\nthis dialog box and you're gonna navigate\n\n366\n00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:27.620\nout to where that particular list of\nvalues that you want to pull from.\n\n367\n00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:29.359\nSo you come over here to this worksheet.\n\n368\n00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.250\nSo now you notice that it's giving\nus the name of a worksheet.\n\n369\n00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:34.810\nYou select your cells.\n\n370\n00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:39.640\nSo then it's giving us our absolute\nvalues of cells C4 through C8 on\n\n371\n00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:40.700\nthis particular worksheet.\n\n372\n00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:43.690\nCome back up in this dialog box.\n\n373\n00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:45.500\nClick the little dropdown button here.\n\n374\n00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.770\nAnd you can still go through and\ndo your input messages and\n\n375\n00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:50.820\nthe error alerts like we had\ndone in our other example.\n\n376\n00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.570\nWe click okay, and\nthen now you can see, ta-da.\n\n377\n00:18:54.570 --> 00:19:00.140\nThere's your little drop down, super cute,\nand ready to go for you to do.\n\n378\n00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:04.850\nSo that's really easy in a sense,\nto be able to create it.\n\n379\n00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:09.190\nIt's the making sure nobody gets back\nto that, that I wanna go ahead and\n\n380\n00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:12.090\nshow you within this episode and\nnot leave that part out.\n\n381\n00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.900\nAll right, so\n\n382\n00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:18.160\nhow do I get these cells to be locked\ncuz right now it is, I changed this.\n\n383\n00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:23.290\nOkay, pretend I have like social media\ncuz this is not locked right now.\n\n384\n00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:25.770\nAnd that's not what you\nwould want somebody to do.\n\n385\n00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:27.233\nSo once I've got all of this.\n\n386\n00:19:27.233 --> 00:19:30.950\nCells are locked by default.\n\n387\n00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:33.610\nYou're like, really?\n\n388\n00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:34.750\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n389\n00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:39.700\n&gt;&gt; That's funny cuz I can change the data\nin a cell any time I feel like it.\n\n390\n00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:42.290\n&gt;&gt; Correct, but it is the default setting.\n\n391\n00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:48.990\nIt's only going to be not,\nit's enforced when the sheet is protected.\n\n392\n00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:54.070\nAs soon as you choose protect sheet,\nevery single cell is\n\n393\n00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:58.790\nlocked automatically unless\nyou tell it to not be locked.\n\n394\n00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:00.560\nSo that's something\na little bit different.\n\n395\n00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:04.620\nSo let me show you, if I'm on this\nworksheet with this particular cell and\n\n396\n00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.600\nI right click and go to format cells.\n\n397\n00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:10.210\nWe talked about doing the format cells\nwhen we did our number formats and\n\n398\n00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:14.100\ninto our different dialogue boxes\nwith a line font, border, and fill.\n\n399\n00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:17.520\nBut we didn't go over onto\nthat Protection tab in here.\n\n400\n00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.815\nAnd notice right there, see, right there?\n\n401\n00:20:19.815 --> 00:20:20.360\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n402\n00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:23.600\n&gt;&gt; The checkbox is on, it says locked.\n\n403\n00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:27.530\nBut only if you protect the sheet.\n\n404\n00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:31.830\nSo if I went into here and I just said,\nlet's go over to Review and\n\n405\n00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:35.970\nI protect the sheet,\nnotice that it's going to do everything.\n\n406\n00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:40.680\nYou can still select locked cells, and\nyou can also select unlocked cells.\n\n407\n00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:44.310\nBut when I throw that password on and\nput that there,\n\n408\n00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:49.560\nnow you can see that I can select it but\nI can't type anything in there.\n\n409\n00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:53.590\nI can go ahead and try and do this but\nnothing is available to me.\n\n410\n00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:54.910\nBecause they are locked.\n\n411\n00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:59.590\nSo that's what you should do when\nmaking lists of information.\n\n412\n00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:01.710\nThrow it on another worksheet.\n\n413\n00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:06.210\nGo ahead and type it all in,\npull the data validations, lock the sheet,\n\n414\n00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:09.190\nmeaning protect it, and\nthen it locks all of your values.\n\n415\n00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:12.505\nAnd even to do one more\nstep is go ahead and\n\n416\n00:21:12.505 --> 00:21:16.240\nthenhHide the worksheet and\nthat way nobody can ever see it.\n\n417\n00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.500\nWell they could find it-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n418\n00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.920\n&gt;&gt; But they still can't be able to\nedit it, so, which is pretty neat.\n\n419\n00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:25.250\nAnd just to kinda go on that whole,\nwe're talking about data validation and\n\n420\n00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:29.770\nnow we're throwing in a whole other kind\nof level of, I can protect the worksheet.\n\n421\n00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:33.590\nWell, if I can lock all my cells down,\nwhat if I wanted to unlock some,\n\n422\n00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:35.480\nbut lock the others down.\n\n423\n00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:39.090\nFor example here, I don't want somebody\ncoming in and messing with my formula.\n\n424\n00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:40.940\nI don't want somebody coming in and\n\n425\n00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:44.600\nchanging the names of the sales\nrepresentatives, or the days of the weeks.\n\n426\n00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:49.850\nThe only thing they should be able to\nmodify are these values right in here.\n\n427\n00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:55.960\nEverything else is locked, so\nthis is kind of in a way validating that,\n\n428\n00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:59.110\nreally restricting access to cells.\n\n429\n00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:03.310\nSo I feel it kind of comes full\ncircle in this particular episode.\n\n430\n00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:06.190\nSo if you know that all\ncells are locked by default,\n\n431\n00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:10.250\nyou have to tell these to be unlocked\nbefore you protect the worksheet.\n\n432\n00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:13.890\nSo let's select these cells,\nwe're gonna right click on that, and\n\n433\n00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:14.716\ngo to format cells.\n\n434\n00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:19.530\nAnd we're gonna uncheck this box here\nto locked, we're gonna click OK.\n\n435\n00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:23.110\nSo this is a not locked,\n\n436\n00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:28.540\nwe're going to over to review and protect\nthe worksheet type in our famous password.\n\n437\n00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:32.580\nI think I typed that in wrong, apple and\nnow this is one where I'm wanna,\n\n438\n00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:35.260\nI don't even want them to be\nable to select the locked cells.\n\n439\n00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:39.420\nThat can get a little tricky too because\nthen it's like, why can't I click on this?\n\n440\n00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:42.340\nAnd I told you,\nI told it to where you can't.\n\n441\n00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:47.330\nSo it's even that next level\nof you can't even edit this,\n\n442\n00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:50.448\nyou can't even select it,\nso you're fine there.\n\n443\n00:22:50.448 --> 00:22:52.680\nBut I wouldn't want them\nto select unlock cells.\n\n444\n00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.520\nAnd there's all these other things\nthat you could say all right or\n\n445\n00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:58.090\nyou could insert rows or\nyou could delete rows.\n\n446\n00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:00.660\nBut then that's kind of I don't know,\n\n447\n00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:03.790\nif you're telling them to not do\nsomething and then you can delete a row,\n\n448\n00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:07.320\nwell then I could delete this whole\npumpkin row and everything that messes up.\n\n449\n00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:10.480\nSo I'm just gonna keep it with\nyou can't do anything else.\n\n450\n00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.920\nAnd we will type this in one more time.\n\n451\n00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:17.450\nAnd notice that I can't even,\nI'm clicking out here, it's not happening.\n\n452\n00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:21.970\nNothing can happen except for in here,\nwhere I can change the numbers and\n\n453\n00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:27.070\nthen my formulas will be updated but\nI can't do anything about that.\n\n454\n00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:30.338\nSo that can be really,\nreally handy as well.\n\n455\n00:23:30.338 --> 00:23:35.996\nSo data validation, doing the circles to\nwhere you can circle the invalid data and\n\n456\n00:23:35.996 --> 00:23:39.695\njust some examples of your warnings and\neverything.\n\n457\n00:23:39.695 --> 00:23:43.720\nJust trying to control what is\ngoing to be going into these files,\n\n458\n00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:48.697\nwhen you are working within a group and\ncollaborating and it's just gonna take it\n\n459\n00:23:48.697 --> 00:23:54.070\nOne step further to ensuring your data\nis done properly, or as much as we can.\n\n460\n00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:58.083\nBut there are some limitations,\nin a sense,\n\n461\n00:23:58.083 --> 00:24:01.577\nlike in the date, if I typed in my name.\n\n462\n00:24:01.577 --> 00:24:06.194\nThere's one where it's just kind of like\nit will allow you to type other things.\n\n463\n00:24:06.194 --> 00:24:11.730\nLike the zip code, the zip code one,\nit's not gonna do it that far.\n\n464\n00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:14.820\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes it's not a perfect solution,\nbut it's something,\n\n465\n00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:16.462\nif you're trying to lock things that way.\n\n466\n00:24:16.462 --> 00:24:19.790\n&gt;&gt; Yes and it's one of those you're trying\nto put a square peg into a round hole.\n\n467\n00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:24.000\nIt doesn't always work exactly\nwithin your situation necessarily.\n\n468\n00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.430\nBut if you can kinda get parts of it,\nit could be very, very helpful.\n\n469\n00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:29.910\nSo I just wanted to throw that out\nthere like, well it does this, but\n\n470\n00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:30.670\nI want it to do that.\n\n471\n00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.980\nThat's just what we got sometimes,\nso, take your pick.\n\n472\n00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:36.820\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne,\nwell that was really cool,\n\n473\n00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:41.460\nbeing able to lockdown our workbooks, our\nworksheets, So that the data that we put\n\n474\n00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:44.970\nin is the data that we expect,\nbecause you know how it works sometimes.\n\n475\n00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:46.520\nPeople get a little funny,\nthey can't read.\n\n476\n00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:50.607\nAnd thanks for Vonne's funny little\nwarnings we might help them out with that,\n\n477\n00:24:50.607 --> 00:24:52.075\nbut you never know, right?\n\n478\n00:24:52.075 --> 00:24:54.525\nWe wanna just put in the data\nthat we're expecting, so\n\n479\n00:24:54.525 --> 00:24:58.230\nthat nothing crazy goes on and get any\nkind of monkey wrenches in our plans.\n\n480\n00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:58.870\nThat being said, Vonne,\n\n481\n00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:02.070\nis there anything else that we need\nto cover before we close our episode?\n\n482\n00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:06.400\n&gt;&gt; Speaking of monkey wrenches,\nlike in our example that we had earlier,\n\n483\n00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:09.973\nit should have this data validation, and\nit should be checking this date, and\n\n484\n00:25:09.973 --> 00:25:12.240\nit's not working, like hmm,\nwe'll come back around to it.\n\n485\n00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.610\nWell, guess what,\nI think we need to revisit that.\n\n486\n00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:17.950\nBut while you were talking about it,\nI went ahead and closed the file, And\n\n487\n00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:20.290\nI didn't save the changes, cuz I wanna\nmake sure you guys have the files.\n\n488\n00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:23.020\nAnd then I'm like, yeah,\nI don't think we ever came back to that.\n\n489\n00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.620\nSo I wanna go ahead and jump back into it.\n\n490\n00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:29.250\nAnd see if we can figure out why\nthis didn't work the first time.\n\n491\n00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:31.970\nSo let's open up that data\nvalidation file again.\n\n492\n00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:35.290\nWe're on that example worksheet.\n\n493\n00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:40.120\nSo we typed in here, and we got\nthe little warning of the input message.\n\n494\n00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:43.100\nAnd speaking about funny messages, there's\na really cute one that I wanted to show\n\n495\n00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.750\nyou guys,and I couldn't get it to work.\n\n496\n00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:47.450\nSo it needs to be after the state.\n\n497\n00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:50.690\nSo we typed in 12, 24, 17 and\nwe realized that was fine.\n\n498\n00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:55.790\nAnd it was this one that we said,\nokay 1-1-1.\n\n499\n00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:57.960\nThat should have thrown\nthe error right there.\n\n500\n00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:00.070\nAnd it wasn't.\n\n501\n00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:01.885\nAnd then we kept going,\nI was like we'll come back around.\n\n502\n00:26:01.885 --> 00:26:03.363\nSo let's try this.\n\n503\n00:26:03.363 --> 00:26:07.958\nIf we try 1-1-1 here,\non this first cell, and hit enter,\n\n504\n00:26:07.958 --> 00:26:10.570\nthat's the one like today junior!\n\n505\n00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:12.433\nDid you not see the input message?\n\n506\n00:26:12.433 --> 00:26:16.230\n&gt;&gt; McFly, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, today.\n\n507\n00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:19.964\nSo we've got this one of like, hey,\nand then at the end of the episode, or\n\n508\n00:26:19.964 --> 00:26:24.001\ntowards the end of the episode, I said\nsomething like it doesn't always work,\n\n509\n00:26:24.001 --> 00:26:26.970\ncuz sometimes it'll let you\nkeep typing in information.\n\n510\n00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:30.670\nAnd all the examples I showed were like,\nit always said was retry, retry.\n\n511\n00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:35.440\nIt never like, let me type in the Vonne\nin the zip code because the text length.\n\n512\n00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:37.650\nBut it was this one that I wanted\nto show you, where it says,\n\n513\n00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:38.980\nwell, do you wanna continue?\n\n514\n00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:43.030\nAnd if I say yes,\nit still lets me put in the wrong date.\n\n515\n00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:46.970\nIt gave me a warning, and\ntold me that that was a problem.\n\n516\n00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:53.040\nBut as opposed to this one, when I typed\nin 1.5, the only option I had was retry.\n\n517\n00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.730\n&gt;&gt; Not really stopping you.\n\n518\n00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:56.330\nWarning you, but not stopping you.\n\n519\n00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:59.829\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it wasn't like, okay do you wanna\ntry again, do you want me to continue?\n\n520\n00:26:59.829 --> 00:27:02.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's like, no.\n\n521\n00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:05.000\nSo, that was the one that I was\nkinda throwing in there that\n\n522\n00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.330\nsomething's not right.\n\n523\n00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:10.090\nSo, I wanted to look at this and\nsee what the problem was.\n\n524\n00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:14.030\nSo, I do know that this is pulling\nfrom a cell reference, and\n\n525\n00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:15.500\nremember that hidden worksheet.\n\n526\n00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.210\nSo, let's do that first.\n\n527\n00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:19.037\nLet's un, whoops,\nthat's not what I wanted to do [LAUGH].\n\n528\n00:27:19.037 --> 00:27:20.720\nI wanna unhide.\n\n529\n00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.430\nAnd so we're going to take this one off.\n\n530\n00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:24.700\nAnd see, it's pulling from here.\n\n531\n00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:28.110\nNow this is cell A5 of\nthe worksheet called high values.\n\n532\n00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:32.640\nSo let's come back over to here,\nShift+Ctrl+down arrow,\n\n533\n00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:39.090\nget all of our rows selected, come over to\nour data, go over to our data validation.\n\n534\n00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:44.206\nI can see what the problem is, right\n\n535\n00:27:44.206 --> 00:27:48.830\nhere, it is doing a whole pull\nfrom a specific cell value.\n\n536\n00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:50.540\nJust like we had with our list.\n\n537\n00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:54.560\nWe said we wanna go from this particular\ncell to this particular cell.\n\n538\n00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:55.810\nAnd it was fine.\n\n539\n00:27:55.810 --> 00:28:00.100\nI know why this didn't work,\nbecause I can tell right there,\n\n540\n00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:04.900\nwith that cell reference of A5,\nthis is not an absolute reference.\n\n541\n00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:06.880\nLet me give you a little\nbit more of a background.\n\n542\n00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:10.180\nWe talk a lot about absolute references\nwhen we're talking about formulas and\n\n543\n00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:12.110\neverything, or functions within excel.\n\n544\n00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:16.540\nLet's come back over to this one,\nand we'll go to our data validation.\n\n545\n00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:20.876\nAnd notice here that it says,\nC4 through C8.\n\n546\n00:28:20.876 --> 00:28:22.181\nAnd look what's in front of that,\n\n547\n00:28:22.181 --> 00:28:24.660\nI don't know if I have that zoomed\nin far enough for you, Daniel.\n\n548\n00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:27.360\nI know your eyeballs are a little,\n&gt;&gt; No, I can see that one,\n\n549\n00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.710\nit looks like a little dollar sign.\n\n550\n00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:32.410\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that dollar sign\nindicates something to us.\n\n551\n00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:35.360\nThis is known as an absolute reference.\n\n552\n00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.740\nAnd I have made references\nto absolute references,\n\n553\n00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:41.558\nthrough part of these\nepisodes in this series.\n\n554\n00:28:41.558 --> 00:28:44.110\nCuz it's saying, always go here.\n\n555\n00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:49.000\nSo it's saying no matter if I move down,\none and I'm copying something,\n\n556\n00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.920\nit is always going to pull from\nC4 through C8, absolutely.\n\n557\n00:28:53.920 --> 00:29:00.250\nIn mine over here, notice if I go over to\nthis data validation, it just says A5.\n\n558\n00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:01.340\nWatch if I click on this one.\n\n559\n00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:02.990\nAnd this is why it didn't work.\n\n560\n00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:06.420\nYou go over here and now it says A6.\n\n561\n00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:10.990\nI moved down one, so it moved\nthe reference down in this formula,\n\n562\n00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:13.510\nif you wanna say, to, okay.\n\n563\n00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:18.870\nAnd if you go down one more,\nit's gonna go to A7, A6, or A8, 10, 9.\n\n564\n00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:19.685\n&gt;&gt; You're a great counter [LAUGH].\n\n565\n00:29:19.685 --> 00:29:21.350\n&gt;&gt; Wow, thanks [LAUGH].\n\n566\n00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:23.270\nI've worked really hard.\n\n567\n00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:27.050\nSo, that's the problem\nin our data validation.\n\n568\n00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:28.710\nSo, we're going to fix it.\n\n569\n00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:31.159\nWe are going to say, no matter what,\n\n570\n00:29:31.159 --> 00:29:35.666\nyou're absolutely going to pull\nfrom that particular cell, A5.\n\n571\n00:29:35.666 --> 00:29:38.680\nSo, let's come into here, we're gonna go.\n\n572\n00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:42.780\nNow, one thing that is a little weird and\nI'll demonstrate this to you.\n\n573\n00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:46.410\nDon't use your keyboard to try to get\nyour flashing cursor in front of it,\n\n574\n00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:48.080\nbecause it doesn't want to do that.\n\n575\n00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:51.900\nLet me show you what I mean, and\nI'll zoom in a little bit so you can see.\n\n576\n00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:54.923\nIf you put your cursor here,\nI got the cursor there,\n\n577\n00:29:54.923 --> 00:29:59.213\nput it in front of the A and I do my\ndollar sign, let me zoom out a little bit.\n\n578\n00:29:59.213 --> 00:30:04.260\nNow I wanna use my cursor to move one\nover, but do you see what it's doing?\n\n579\n00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:08.325\nIt's actually moving around\nwithin the reference, so\n\n580\n00:30:08.325 --> 00:30:11.272\nlike say, where do you wanna find this?\n\n581\n00:30:11.272 --> 00:30:13.670\nAnd this can really, really throw you off.\n\n582\n00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:15.430\nSo let's not do that.\n\n583\n00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:17.780\nWe're going to take this off.\n\n584\n00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:19.680\nAnd okay, there we go.\n\n585\n00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.990\nSo I need to make sure\nI had the single quote.\n\n586\n00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:24.645\nThe other single quote,\nand the exclamation point,\n\n587\n00:30:24.645 --> 00:30:27.640\nbecause the exclamation point\nindicates the sheet name.\n\n588\n00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:32.300\nAnd now we're gonna do dollar sign,\ntake your mouse,\n\n589\n00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:35.600\nput your cursor, there's that five,\ndo the dollar sign.\n\n590\n00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:40.440\nSo now it's saying don't ever change\nfrom this particular cell reference,\n\n591\n00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:41.770\nof the date.\n\n592\n00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:47.667\nYou click OK, you zoom back out,\nand I bet you, if we go ahead and\n\n593\n00:30:47.667 --> 00:30:54.563\nget rid of those, now we should be\nable to do 12 24 17, that's fine.\n\n594\n00:30:54.563 --> 00:30:57.467\n1- 1 -1, there you go.\n\n595\n00:30:57.467 --> 00:30:59.415\nAnd if we go down, sorry.\n\n596\n00:30:59.415 --> 00:31:03.045\n[LAUGH] No, I'm not gonna continue,\nokay fine, cancel.\n\n597\n00:31:03.045 --> 00:31:08.013\nAnd then if I go down to here, 1-1-1, it's\nstill gonna go ahead and throw me that\n\n598\n00:31:08.013 --> 00:31:13.130\nmessage, because I had to make an absolute\nreference instead of a relative reference.\n\n599\n00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:16.160\nThat is why it didn't work,\nand now we all know.\n\n600\n00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.560\nI think now I can sleep better.\n\n601\n00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:19.700\n&gt;&gt; You sleeping all right, yeah [LAUGH].\n\n602\n00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:23.588\n&gt;&gt; Knowing that I've come back around,\nbecause if you're like me, I'm like, well,\n\n603\n00:31:23.588 --> 00:31:24.581\nwhy it didn't work?\n\n604\n00:31:24.581 --> 00:31:26.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well then show me how to fix it.\n\n605\n00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:31.550\nSo now that I've come full circle,\nour department of redundancy department.\n\n606\n00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:34.230\n[LAUGH] Come back around to keep on going,\n\n607\n00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:37.710\nto make sure you know how to do data\nvalidation with cell references.\n\n608\n00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:38.564\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne.\n\n609\n00:31:38.564 --> 00:31:42.181\nWell thank you so much, because that's\ndefinitely a important little key there,\n\n610\n00:31:42.181 --> 00:31:44.870\nif you're trying to do that\ntype of data validation.\n\n611\n00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:46.280\nIt's not gonna work, as we saw.\n\n612\n00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:49.260\nSo you gotta go in there and make sure\nyou make that absolute reference.\n\n613\n00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:52.840\nLot of fun stuff, and we've learned\nthat Vonne is a little crazy.\n\n614\n00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:53.760\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is true [LAUGH].\n\n615\n00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.710\n&gt;&gt; A little bit, just a little bit,\nbut the kind we like.\n\n616\n00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:56.460\nRight, ladies and gentlemen?\n\n617\n00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:57.620\nIt's been a lot of fun today.\n\n618\n00:31:57.620 --> 00:31:59.360\nVonne, we do thank you for joining us.\n\n619\n00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.990\nWe do thank our audience for\nwatching as well.\n\n620\n00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:03.800\nBut it is that time for\nus to sign off for Office Pro TV.\n\n621\n00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.310\nI've been your

another great\nepisode of Office ProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.900\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode, well we're back for\n\n5\n00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.120\nmore in our Excel 2016 Advanced Series.\n\n6\n00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.400\nAnd joining us yet\nagain lending us her expertise for\n\n7\n00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.980\nus to learn, our good friend,\nMrs. Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.510\nVonne, we're so\nglad to have you yet again.\n\n9\n00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:24.390\nHow's it going today?\n\n10\n00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.771\n&gt;&gt; It's going fantastic.\n\n11\n00:00:25.771 --> 00:00:28.560\n&gt;&gt; Excellent.\n&gt;&gt; Ready to talk about more security.\n\n12\n00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.359\n&gt;&gt; Yes, cuz we're in our collaborate and\nsecurity topic area.\n\n13\n00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.116\nAnd in this particular episode,\nwe're gonna talk about workbook security.\n\n14\n00:00:36.116 --> 00:00:40.495\nAnd there is couple of different levels\nthat we're going to hit in this particular\n\n15\n00:00:40.495 --> 00:00:41.072\nepisode.\n\n16\n00:00:41.072 --> 00:00:44.560\nOf protecting a worksheet,\nprotecting a workbook, going ahead and\n\n17\n00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.070\nthrowing a password on that.\n\n18\n00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.850\nWe'll also maybe touch on\nsome digital signatures.\n\n19\n00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:49.970\nNot maybe, we will.\n\n20\n00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.275\nSo that is on the agenda\nin our show notes.\n\n21\n00:00:53.275 --> 00:00:58.153\nSo we did talk a little bit about\nprotecting a worksheet when we were\n\n22\n00:00:58.153 --> 00:01:01.040\nin our episode about data validation.\n\n23\n00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.700\nBecause it just felt like it\nkinda lended itself to there.\n\n24\n00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.680\nSo we're gonna use that as a repeat.\n\n25\n00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.810\nSo if you did watch that episode,\n\n26\n00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.530\nwe're gonna redo that one\nlittle chunk right now.\n\n27\n00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.156\nSo why don't we go ahead and start there?\n\n28\n00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:16.147\nI have a workbook called\nWorkbook Security.\n\n29\n00:01:16.147 --> 00:01:17.000\nYeah, I know.\n\n30\n00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.768\nI'm so clever with these names, aren't I?\n\n31\n00:01:18.768 --> 00:01:19.761\n&gt;&gt; Man you're like.\n\n32\n00:01:19.761 --> 00:01:21.688\nYou should write album names or something.\n\n33\n00:01:21.688 --> 00:01:23.501\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, super creative.\n\n34\n00:01:23.501 --> 00:01:25.915\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] They're just yep, there you go.\n\n35\n00:01:25.915 --> 00:01:28.120\n[LAUGH] So we have our file here.\n\n36\n00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:34.050\nCuz in the data validation episode,\nwe were doing different ways to\n\n37\n00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:40.190\nlimit what type of information people are\nputting into ourselves and our worksheets.\n\n38\n00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.786\nSo if I want it to be a whole number or we\nhad that drop down, that was really fun.\n\n39\n00:01:45.786 --> 00:01:51.484\nAnd then we also talked about, well in\nthis sense if I'm gonna start securing\n\n40\n00:01:51.484 --> 00:01:56.755\nmy information down, I can protect\na worksheet and lock my cells down.\n\n41\n00:01:56.755 --> 00:02:01.436\nNow in our cells, actually,\nall of your cells are locked by default.\n\n42\n00:02:01.436 --> 00:02:03.660\nWhat do you mean they're\nlocked by default?\n\n43\n00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.500\nI can click on them.\n\n44\n00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.390\nI can come over here and select this.\n\n45\n00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.870\nAnd I can change this Christmas Cats and\nI can do all this stuff.\n\n46\n00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.930\nSo I don't know what you mean.\n\n47\n00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.167\nWell, they're locked by default.\n\n48\n00:02:13.167 --> 00:02:18.630\nAnd it will be enforced when\nyou protect the worksheet.\n\n49\n00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.270\nWell if you don't ever\nprotect the worksheet,\n\n50\n00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.380\nthen you're never gonna have that\nenforcement of the locked cells.\n\n51\n00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.470\nSo, let me show you what I mean.\n\n52\n00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.640\nIn our Format Cells dialogue box.\n\n53\n00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.170\nNow we've been to this\na couple different times.\n\n54\n00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.573\nWe've gone to it from our dialogue box\nlauncher button within our different\n\n55\n00:02:35.573 --> 00:02:36.135\ngroups.\n\n56\n00:02:36.135 --> 00:02:37.990\nAnd I'm gonna show you by right-clicking.\n\n57\n00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.646\nSo you could right-click on any cell and\ngo to Formal Cells and\n\n58\n00:02:41.646 --> 00:02:43.421\nit takes you right into this.\n\n59\n00:02:43.421 --> 00:02:46.885\nWe talked a lot about number formats and\ncustom number formats.\n\n60\n00:02:46.885 --> 00:02:50.197\nAnd we went through these different tabs\nwith the alignment, and the font, and\n\n61\n00:02:50.197 --> 00:02:51.340\nthe border, and the fill.\n\n62\n00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.277\nBut we didn't really come over\nhere to the protection tab.\n\n63\n00:02:54.277 --> 00:02:55.370\nAnd that's where it is.\n\n64\n00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.330\nRight there, look at that.\n\n65\n00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.363\nIt says locked, locking cells\nare hiding formulas that way when you,\n\n66\n00:03:01.363 --> 00:03:05.132\nuntil you [SOUND] let me try that again,\nokay rewind.\n\n67\n00:03:05.132 --> 00:03:05.955\n&gt;&gt; You can read.\n\n68\n00:03:05.955 --> 00:03:07.870\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, we'll try.\n\n69\n00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.670\n[LAUGH] Locking cells or\nhiding formulas has no effect\n\n70\n00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.590\nuntil you protect the worksheet.\n\n71\n00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.865\n&gt;&gt; It's an interesting thing that they\ndid it that way that it's by default it's\n\n72\n00:03:19.865 --> 00:03:20.706\nturned on, but\n\n73\n00:03:20.706 --> 00:03:25.134\nit only actually does what it's defaulted\nto do is if you turn something else on.\n\n74\n00:03:25.134 --> 00:03:26.013\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n75\n00:03:26.013 --> 00:03:27.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's kinda weird and\n\n76\n00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.235\nlike why would you wanna\nhave the default be locked?\n\n77\n00:03:29.235 --> 00:03:31.209\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I'm guessing people were forgetting\n\n78\n00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:32.248\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n79\n00:03:32.248 --> 00:03:33.340\n&gt;&gt; They were like, yeah,\n\n80\n00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.680\nlet's do this whole protect sheet thing\nand why is it not protecting the sheet?\n\n81\n00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.090\nI've got to turn that on.\n\n82\n00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.140\nSo they put it on by default.\n\n83\n00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.170\nAnd now when people go to actually\nprotect the sheet, it is already enabled.\n\n84\n00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.432\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That would be my guess.\n\n85\n00:03:44.432 --> 00:03:48.543\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and if you also think about\nhow many cells we have, in a worksheet.\n\n86\n00:03:48.543 --> 00:03:49.320\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot.\n\n87\n00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you wouldn't want\nto select just a little bit and\n\n88\n00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.925\nsay let's lock these, and\nall the other ones are unlocked.\n\n89\n00:03:54.925 --> 00:03:57.617\nAnd that means they could go and\nselect all that stuff.\n\n90\n00:03:57.617 --> 00:04:02.292\nSo I think it's easier, if it's let's\ngo ahead and choose the ones that you\n\n91\n00:04:02.292 --> 00:04:06.822\ndon't want to be locked, rather than\nwhere we have over a million rows and\n\n92\n00:04:06.822 --> 00:04:09.910\n65,536 columns, that's a lot to select.\n\n93\n00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.921\nSo I think that's another reason of why\nthey've kind of thrown it in that reverse.\n\n94\n00:04:13.921 --> 00:04:18.630\nSo, if you don't do anything it's fine but\nthere would be times where, okay,\n\n95\n00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.300\nI want to go ahead and\nlock down some things but\n\n96\n00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.280\nthen the other things I do\nwant to stay available.\n\n97\n00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.310\nSo in this example right here,\nI wouldn't want people to come in and\n\n98\n00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.180\nchange the names of\nthe sales representatives.\n\n99\n00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.370\nI wouldn't want them to come in and\n\n100\n00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.170\nchange my formulas because\nthis is what needs to stick.\n\n101\n00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.690\nSo the only thing that I would want people\nto really change would be maybe the date.\n\n102\n00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.390\nThe numbers here, and\nthen maybe something in the notes.\n\n103\n00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.620\nI don't want them moving\nthat little cute cat.\n\n104\n00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.990\nI don't want them changing anything,\nthat's the only thing they're able to do.\n\n105\n00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.670\nSo we're going to unlock\nsome of our cells and\n\n106\n00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.138\nthen all the other ones that are default,\n\n107\n00:04:55.138 --> 00:04:58.260\nbeing locked, then we're gonna protect\nthe sheet and see how it works.\n\n108\n00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.160\nSo to make multiple sections we\nknow we can hold our Ctrl key,\n\n109\n00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.990\nthat is the wrong one on this keyboard.\n\n110\n00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.170\nSo lets go ahead and try that again.\n\n111\n00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.816\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n112\n00:05:04.816 --> 00:05:07.620\n&gt;&gt; There is this one, there we go.\n\n113\n00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.500\nAll right, and\nthen we will also select that.\n\n114\n00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.140\nSo I'm using that control to\nselect multiple cells and\n\n115\n00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.798\nmultiple ranges of cells.\n\n116\n00:05:13.798 --> 00:05:17.250\nWe're gonna right-click over one\nof those selected areas, and\n\n117\n00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.870\nwe're gonna go to Format Cells.\n\n118\n00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.420\nThen we're gonna uncheck lock.\n\n119\n00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.436\nThis would be unlocked.\n\n120\n00:05:24.436 --> 00:05:27.920\nNow we're going to protect the sheet.\n\n121\n00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.480\nSo we're going from the sheet level,\nthen the workbook level, and\n\n122\n00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.850\nthen the file level.\n\n123\n00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.220\nCome over here to Review,\nand there is Protect Sheet.\n\n124\n00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.180\nAnd you can see,\nit takes unwanted changes.\n\n125\n00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.390\nAnd we click on that, we need to go\nahead and type in our password, always.\n\n126\n00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:45.780\nAnd look at some of\nthe options that you have.\n\n127\n00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.220\nIt's going to protect worksheets and\ncontents of locked cells.\n\n128\n00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.660\nBut there're some other things that I\nwould like them to, these exceptions.\n\n129\n00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.860\nWhat would I allow them to be able to do?\n\n130\n00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.878\nThese first two are the ones\nthat are owned by default.\n\n131\n00:05:58.878 --> 00:06:02.719\nThey can select Lock Cells,\nthey can't doing anything to it.\n\n132\n00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:05.105\nAnd then they could also\nselect Unlock Cells.\n\n133\n00:06:05.105 --> 00:06:08.614\nYou would definitely want that to happen\ncuz that's what you want them to do.\n\n134\n00:06:08.614 --> 00:06:10.201\n[LAUGH] But this is where,\n\n135\n00:06:10.201 --> 00:06:14.755\ndo you wanna even give them\nthe ability to select a locked cell?\n\n136\n00:06:14.755 --> 00:06:16.735\nCuz that might be even more, I don't know.\n\n137\n00:06:16.735 --> 00:06:18.755\nI think it's gonna be confusing one way or\nthe other.\n\n138\n00:06:18.755 --> 00:06:20.065\nWhy can't I select this?\n\n139\n00:06:20.065 --> 00:06:21.135\nWhy can't I change it?\n\n140\n00:06:21.135 --> 00:06:26.568\nSo, half done, one way or\nthe, what, half six dozen?\n\n141\n00:06:26.568 --> 00:06:28.007\nSo I never get these things right.\n\n142\n00:06:28.007 --> 00:06:30.756\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I think Wes had the same\nproblem with the exact same one the other\n\n143\n00:06:30.756 --> 00:06:31.667\nday, it was so funny.\n\n144\n00:06:31.667 --> 00:06:33.715\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it is six of one,\n\n145\n00:06:33.715 --> 00:06:35.933\nhalf a dozen of another.\n\n146\n00:06:35.933 --> 00:06:36.551\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n147\n00:06:36.551 --> 00:06:38.197\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's why you just need to be by my\n\n148\n00:06:38.197 --> 00:06:41.032\nside all the time when I'm trying\nto throw out these things.\n\n149\n00:06:41.032 --> 00:06:41.664\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n150\n00:06:41.664 --> 00:06:44.065\n&gt;&gt; So you have to pick which one you want.\n\n151\n00:06:44.065 --> 00:06:46.745\nSo I'm not gonna have a not\neven select lock cells.\n\n152\n00:06:46.745 --> 00:06:51.627\nThere are some other ones in here well\nthen you could also insert rows or\n\n153\n00:06:51.627 --> 00:06:52.634\ndelete rows.\n\n154\n00:06:52.634 --> 00:06:55.922\nThat just kinda seems weird if you\ncan delete a whole column or row.\n\n155\n00:06:55.922 --> 00:07:00.550\n[LAUGH] And it takes away from the whole\nidea of not being able to change things.\n\n156\n00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.490\nBut there could be reasons\nwhy you want to do this.\n\n157\n00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:04.930\nI do have in the show notes,\n\n158\n00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.920\nthere is a link to a website\nthat kinda lists all of these.\n\n159\n00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.170\nAnd the one that I thought was funny,\nwas right here,\n\n160\n00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:13.890\nthat would be nice to be able to sort\nthings, but I want them to lock it down.\n\n161\n00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.881\nBut even if you check that off,\nyou can't sort it.\n\n162\n00:07:15.881 --> 00:07:18.990\nYeah, they're like, it just can't be done,\nso then why do you even give it an option?\n\n163\n00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:21.210\nBut I don't know,\ncheck it out, you'll see.\n\n164\n00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:25.430\nWe'll go ahead and click Okay, and\nthen we'll retype our password in.\n\n165\n00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.652\nI will zoom out of here.\n\n166\n00:07:27.652 --> 00:07:32.290\nAnd now you can see that I can't even,\nyou can't see my hand and my mouse.\n\n167\n00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:36.300\nI can't even select the cells over here,\nor select the cells over here.\n\n168\n00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.770\nThe only ones I can select\nare the ones that I unlocked.\n\n169\n00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:44.526\nSo I can come into here, and\nchange the values in there, and\n\n170\n00:07:44.526 --> 00:07:49.676\nI could go ahead and\nnotice I can't even, I can't, ooh hello.\n\n171\n00:07:49.676 --> 00:07:55.020\nI can't even change the column widths\neither so that's kind of a thing.\n\n172\n00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.813\nIt's locked down,\nthis is the only thing I'm able to do.\n\n173\n00:07:57.813 --> 00:08:01.617\nSo, pick accordingly and\nmake sure you have the right password, and\n\n174\n00:08:01.617 --> 00:08:05.040\nthat the admin person is going\nto be the one that changes that.\n\n175\n00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.460\nSo that is protecting a worksheet.\n\n176\n00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.930\nNow let's go one more level up,\nprotecting the workbook.\n\n177\n00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.254\nBecause this one sheet is protected but\nthis one isn't,\n\n178\n00:08:15.254 --> 00:08:18.710\nlike I can do all the different\nchanges here that I wanna do.\n\n179\n00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:21.550\nSo you would have to lock\neach sheet individually.\n\n180\n00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.830\nWhen you protect a workbook, what you're\ngonna be doing is protecting the structure\n\n181\n00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:31.190\nof the workbook, meaning I can\nmove these worksheets around,\n\n182\n00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:34.460\nwe talked about that in\nour modifying a workbook.\n\n183\n00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.598\nI could add a new sheet,\nI could rename it, I can copy and paste.\n\n184\n00:08:37.598 --> 00:08:43.671\nI can do all sorts of fun stuff with the\nactual structure of this particular file,\n\n185\n00:08:43.671 --> 00:08:48.060\nI can delete this one as well and\nthen there we go.\n\n186\n00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:52.580\nIf you protect the workbook,\nthen all of that can't be modified.\n\n187\n00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:56.590\nSo you could see keeping,\nkeep others from making structural changes\n\n188\n00:08:56.590 --> 00:09:01.050\nto your workbook such as moving,\ndeleting, and adding sheets.\n\n189\n00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:03.600\nSo, there you go,\nwe will go ahead and put that one on.\n\n190\n00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.404\nWe'll name this orange, that sounds good.\n\n191\n00:09:06.404 --> 00:09:08.247\nThen we'll reconfirm that.\n\n192\n00:09:08.247 --> 00:09:14.565\nAnd now that I've protected the workbook,\nnotice I can't drag and drop this,\n\n193\n00:09:14.565 --> 00:09:20.034\nI can't do any of these things like\nchanging the tab color or moving or\n\n194\n00:09:20.034 --> 00:09:26.845\ncopying the worksheet, so that particular\nlevel of protection on your workbook..\n\n195\n00:09:26.845 --> 00:09:30.840\nAnd remember, and so sheet level,\nthen you have the workbook level.\n\n196\n00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.870\nAnd then there's another one over here\nwhen you start getting into the file tab.\n\n197\n00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:39.283\nThe file tab is where, it's nice that it's\nshowing you that there's some things that\n\n198\n00:09:39.283 --> 00:09:41.278\nare in protection on the workbook, but\n\n199\n00:09:41.278 --> 00:09:44.739\nthen there's another one where you\ncan encrypt it with a password.\n\n200\n00:09:44.739 --> 00:09:47.320\nSo we will be doing passwords\non a whole bunch of things.\n\n201\n00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.974\nBut this is one where,\neven before you can even open the file,\n\n202\n00:09:50.974 --> 00:09:52.746\nyou got to have the password.\n\n203\n00:09:52.746 --> 00:09:58.335\nSo, this is, that next level,\nI'd say this is like the file level up.\n\n204\n00:09:58.335 --> 00:10:01.580\nSo let's, whoops,\nthat is not what I wanted to do.\n\n205\n00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.314\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I forgot to click the button,\n\n206\n00:10:03.314 --> 00:10:05.235\nwe will go to encrypt with the password.\n\n207\n00:10:05.235 --> 00:10:08.952\nThere you go,\nnotice that if you lose the password this\n\n208\n00:10:08.952 --> 00:10:13.612\nis not going to be recoverable,\nunless you have Daniel or\n\n209\n00:10:13.612 --> 00:10:16.891\nMike that will be able to\nhack anything pretty much.\n\n210\n00:10:16.891 --> 00:10:17.778\nSeriously, they can.\n\n211\n00:10:17.778 --> 00:10:22.252\n[LAUGH] We can go into Apple and\nI will retype it again,\n\n212\n00:10:22.252 --> 00:10:26.410\ncuz Apples have password for everything.\n\n213\n00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:28.660\nAnd I save this, I close this.\n\n214\n00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:31.570\nYes, I would like to save this.\n\n215\n00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:36.080\nAnd then we come back over here to,\nthere we go.\n\n216\n00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:41.851\nNotice that I can't even get into the file\nat all unless I have that password.\n\n217\n00:10:41.851 --> 00:10:46.922\nAnd then once I'm here, now I still have\nall my other levels, the workbook level\n\n218\n00:10:46.922 --> 00:10:52.081\nand the worksheet level, so you can go all\nthe way through all of those, perfect.\n\n219\n00:10:52.081 --> 00:10:56.862\nThere is one thing that I'm looking at\nmy note that I actually skipped over,\n\n220\n00:10:56.862 --> 00:10:59.191\nwhich is allow users to edit ranges.\n\n221\n00:10:59.191 --> 00:11:02.960\nSo this is something that I'm gonna read\nfrom my notes because I forgot to pull up\n\n222\n00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:03.986\nthe website before.\n\n223\n00:11:03.986 --> 00:11:06.389\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it is in the show notes here.\n\n224\n00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:11.009\nIt says to give specific users permission\nto edit ranges in a protected worksheet,\n\n225\n00:11:11.009 --> 00:11:13.260\nso we know about protecting worksheet.\n\n226\n00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:17.633\nBut it says, your computer must be\nrunning on Windows XP or layer, well,\n\n227\n00:11:17.633 --> 00:11:21.807\nI hope your Windows XP or layer,\nyou shouldn't even be on Windows XP.\n\n228\n00:11:21.807 --> 00:11:24.522\n&gt;&gt; If you're on Windows XP right now, shut\nyour computer off and go get another one.\n\n229\n00:11:24.522 --> 00:11:25.818\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n230\n00:11:25.818 --> 00:11:27.200\n[LAUGH] Update.\n\n231\n00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.167\nYeah, just throw that one out.\n\n232\n00:11:28.167 --> 00:11:29.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n233\n00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:31.676\n&gt;&gt; You drill through it so\nyou can't get the hard drive information.\n\n234\n00:11:31.676 --> 00:11:37.750\n[LAUGH] And your computer must be on\na domain, that was the kick I went, okay.\n\n235\n00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:39.640\nInstead of using permissions\nthat require domain,\n\n236\n00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.160\nyou can also specify a password for\narrange.\n\n237\n00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:47.321\nSo it's like, you need to be careful, like\nthis is where you can give certain people\n\n238\n00:11:47.321 --> 00:11:52.266\ncertain aspects of specific ranges, like\nyou can edit this particular range and\n\n239\n00:11:52.266 --> 00:11:55.047\nthat person can edit\nthat particular range.\n\n240\n00:11:55.047 --> 00:11:59.299\n&gt;&gt; Like I might be able to update the\naddresses on this worksheet right here,\n\n241\n00:11:59.299 --> 00:12:01.985\nbut I can't do the phone numbers and\nthe city.\n\n242\n00:12:01.985 --> 00:12:04.669\nMaybe you do the cities and\nMike does the states,\n\n243\n00:12:04.669 --> 00:12:05.792\nin that way-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n244\n00:12:05.792 --> 00:12:08.585\nAll the powers in not one person's hand.\n\n245\n00:12:08.585 --> 00:12:12.085\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and that's where I'm\ndesignating to specific people,\n\n246\n00:12:12.085 --> 00:12:16.465\nI'm attaching it to users, that's\nwhere you do need to be on our domain.\n\n247\n00:12:16.465 --> 00:12:18.067\nNow I could go ahead and\n\n248\n00:12:18.067 --> 00:12:23.040\ncreate a range, like right here I\ncould say, let's just say that I'm\n\n249\n00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.769\nallowing people to edit the city-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n250\n00:12:25.769 --> 00:12:26.900\n&gt;&gt; But that's it.\n\n251\n00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:31.900\nSo if I select this and come over to data,\nthat would be the review tab, sorry,\n\n252\n00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.870\nand I go to allow users to edit ranges.\n\n253\n00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:37.370\nAnd then I click new,\nnotice it is pulling.\n\n254\n00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:41.501\nAnd there's that absolute reference again,\nwe go those dollar signs, and\n\n255\n00:12:41.501 --> 00:12:43.490\nI can name this city.\n\n256\n00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:47.770\nAnd then the range password is,\nagain, apple.\n\n257\n00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:50.780\nBut if you go into permissions,\nthis is where you see right there.\n\n258\n00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:53.771\nAnd this should look familiar to me\nwhen you do like Windows Security,\n\n259\n00:12:53.771 --> 00:12:54.840\nlike the users.\n\n260\n00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:55.770\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n261\n00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:57.230\nThis particular dialog box.\n\n262\n00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:59.430\nSo you can add or\ndeny in all sorts of difference.\n\n263\n00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:04.590\nBut it says, I don't have any groups, so\nit's not being able to pull from that.\n\n264\n00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:09.932\nBut I can still go ahead and specify a\npassword for the range that people can do.\n\n265\n00:13:09.932 --> 00:13:12.596\nAnd if I click okay, and we will go here.\n\n266\n00:13:12.596 --> 00:13:16.668\nThere we go, I've added that and\nI'm gonna protect the worksheet and\n\n267\n00:13:16.668 --> 00:13:19.510\nwe're using the same password for\neverything.\n\n268\n00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:24.410\nIsn't that like, rule number one, don't\nuse the same password for everything.\n\n269\n00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:27.550\nWe'll click okay, and I will do it again.\n\n270\n00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:31.580\nSo now you can see that if I'm over\nhere and I try, I can't type anything,\n\n271\n00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.660\nall right, well, we can't do that.\n\n272\n00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:37.388\nAll right, so if I come over here,\nthis is the one where I started typing,\n\n273\n00:13:37.388 --> 00:13:40.696\nit's giving me a different\nwarning box like, okay, well,\n\n274\n00:13:40.696 --> 00:13:42.930\nI see you're trying to edit this.\n\n275\n00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:49.895\nWell, this is a designated range that I as\nthe creator of this has put a password on.\n\n276\n00:13:49.895 --> 00:13:52.675\nSo if I did have the password,\nI could go ahead and do it.\n\n277\n00:13:52.675 --> 00:13:55.044\nAnd that's, again,\nwhere we don't have to be on domain.\n\n278\n00:13:55.044 --> 00:13:59.508\nBut I could give you the password and\nsomebody else a different password.\n\n279\n00:13:59.508 --> 00:14:02.279\nSo I can still designate\nyou doing the cities and\n\n280\n00:14:02.279 --> 00:14:07.000\nMike doing the addresses or what have you,\nI just give you different passwords.\n\n281\n00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.167\nSo, there is those types of\ndifferent things that you-\n\n282\n00:14:10.167 --> 00:14:10.747\n&gt;&gt; Just a little more\n\n283\n00:14:10.747 --> 00:14:12.307\nadministratively difficult.\n\n284\n00:14:12.307 --> 00:14:13.967\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and just a different level.\n\n285\n00:14:13.967 --> 00:14:15.582\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And you might have, I mean,\n\n286\n00:14:15.582 --> 00:14:17.577\nif I have what, 12 rows on here, [LAUGH].\n\n287\n00:14:17.577 --> 00:14:19.662\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's a little bit different than\n\n288\n00:14:19.662 --> 00:14:23.511\nhaving 12,000 or 120,000, and\nyou're responsible for this, and\n\n289\n00:14:23.511 --> 00:14:26.440\nyou're responsible for that,\nand so on and so forth.\n\n290\n00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.980\nSo, again, domains are great\nif you wanted to go ahead and\n\n291\n00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:31.780\ngive it at that specific level but\nstill can do it.\n\n292\n00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.920\nJust give out different\npasswords to people.\n\n293\n00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.969\nAnd by giving it, don't necessarily\nput it on email or anywhere else.\n\n294\n00:14:36.969 --> 00:14:39.489\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But hey, pull a different level and\n\n295\n00:14:39.489 --> 00:14:41.060\nwe'll go from there.\n\n296\n00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:46.655\nI wanna save this file, and I just\nrealized I put on all sorts of passwords\n\n297\n00:14:46.655 --> 00:14:50.808\non that file, so I hope to remove\nthem all for you when I send it up.\n\n298\n00:14:50.808 --> 00:14:53.736\nAnd you guys are actually\ndownloading the files and\n\n299\n00:14:53.736 --> 00:14:56.800\nfollowing along with me in the episode.\n\n300\n00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.570\nIf by any chance I miss any just-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n301\n00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:00.130\n&gt;&gt; Just send me an email [LAUGH] and\n\n302\n00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:01.960\nI'll send you a clean copy.\n\n303\n00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.670\nI did make a workbook security 2 just for\n\n304\n00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:06.980\nthis exact purpose of like let me,\nI already have a clean copy.\n\n305\n00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:08.344\nHere, you know what we're gonna do?\n\n306\n00:15:08.344 --> 00:15:09.815\nWe're gonna copy that right there.\n\n307\n00:15:09.815 --> 00:15:12.700\n[LAUGH] We'll copy it\nbefore we even start.\n\n308\n00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:14.786\nSo forget everything I just said,\nI got you a good one, you're fine.\n\n309\n00:15:14.786 --> 00:15:19.055\n[LAUGH] So at the second level there's a\nfew other things that we can do over here\n\n310\n00:15:19.055 --> 00:15:21.110\nunlike the file level.\n\n311\n00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:26.134\nAnd we talked about encrypting it with\na password but there's this Marcus final.\n\n312\n00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:30.257\nNow this Marcus final,\nit's more of a suggestion,\n\n313\n00:15:30.257 --> 00:15:34.810\nit's not really going to\nsecure you from anything.\n\n314\n00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:38.490\nLet's show you, let's see what it does,\nthis workbook will be marked as final.\n\n315\n00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:43.280\nGreat, okay, perfect, we click okay,\nthat's all they're gonna get.\n\n316\n00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.393\nIf they open the file it's like,\n\n317\n00:15:45.393 --> 00:15:48.645\nthe author has marked this\nto discourage editing.\n\n318\n00:15:48.645 --> 00:15:50.704\nWell, all they have to do\nis click this button and\n\n319\n00:15:50.704 --> 00:15:52.287\nthey're off to the races, so-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, go for it.\n\n320\n00:15:52.287 --> 00:15:54.320\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's not really doing anything.\n\n321\n00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.913\nNow, if you had protected sheets and\neverything,\n\n322\n00:15:56.913 --> 00:16:00.000\nthat would still go ahead,\nbut again, that's a separate.\n\n323\n00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.110\nEntity in a separate level there, but the\nmarket's final is just a mere suggestion.\n\n324\n00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:09.340\nAnd then we have the,\nI'm just reading my notes, the passer.\n\n325\n00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:13.130\nOkay, the last two things that\nare in this protect worksheet.\n\n326\n00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:18.140\nWe have the restrict access and\nadd digital signatures, ooh, fun.\n\n327\n00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:23.680\nThe restrict access, this is on the, you\ndo have to be on a domain of some sort.\n\n328\n00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:27.940\nBecause this is where you're going\nto be getting into the different\n\n329\n00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:32.240\naccess of where I can restrict\naccess to either read or change.\n\n330\n00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:35.040\nBut it's based on my user.\n\n331\n00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:40.750\nSo I have to go out and find Joey or\nLance or if I was on a much\n\n332\n00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:44.890\nlarger network it would be connected to\nthe Active Directory or whatever that is\n\n333\n00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:48.800\nthat kind of gives a directory of\nthe people within your network.\n\n334\n00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:54.270\nSo it does get into what are known as IRM,\n\n335\n00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:00.490\nIndividual Rights Management,\nI believe that's what it stands for.\n\n336\n00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:04.600\nIt's in the show notes, there is a link\nto it where it does talk about adding and\n\n337\n00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.280\nremoving protection from your documents.\n\n338\n00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:11.300\nBut it does go to a different level than\njust like a one on one type of thing.\n\n339\n00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:15.270\nLook at that, our director's\nmeeting is here in the conference.\n\n340\n00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:18.130\nI bet you that's because, you know why?\n\n341\n00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:18.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Outlook running.\n\n342\n00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.700\n&gt;&gt; I had Outlook running and because iChat\nwas coming into this managers when I was\n\n343\n00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:25.360\nlooking at,\nI had this happen in my other episodes.\n\n344\n00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:26.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Where it's like,\n\n345\n00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:29.650\nit's all connected to where\nit talks to each other, and\n\n346\n00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:31.140\nthat's why that just threw off.\n\n347\n00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:34.020\nI was like, yeah, I remember that.\n\n348\n00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:37.440\nI guess I still have that\non my calendar there.\n\n349\n00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.790\nAnd there you get so just again make\nsure you understand that you need to be\n\n350\n00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:44.610\non a separate level for implementing this.\n\n351\n00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:49.120\nAnd if you're doing this as\na something you might to talk to your\n\n352\n00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:52.930\nnetwork administrators and\nget you on that to kind of have that.\n\n353\n00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:56.050\nIt's one like the whole editing ranges\nwhere we all have to kinda have\n\n354\n00:17:56.050 --> 00:18:01.220\nthose different, well,\ndomains to know who everybody's at.\n\n355\n00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:05.810\nOkay, and the other thing that you will\ndefinitely need to be talking to your IT\n\n356\n00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:09.180\nadministrator for\nadding a digital signature.\n\n357\n00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:12.750\nNow, I know you know a little\nbit about digital signatures or\n\n358\n00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:17.948\nat least enough with the hashings and\nthe tags and the no.\n\n359\n00:18:17.948 --> 00:18:19.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The hashings.\n\n360\n00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:23.653\n&gt;&gt; With the hash values, yes,\nokay, so let's just break it down.\n\n361\n00:18:23.653 --> 00:18:28.298\nWhen I think of a digital signature I\nthink of like the secret handshake to like\n\n362\n00:18:28.298 --> 00:18:30.308\na secret meeting, or whatever.\n\n363\n00:18:30.308 --> 00:18:34.335\nTo where I have been told that\nyou have to shake twice and\n\n364\n00:18:34.335 --> 00:18:39.860\nthen point you finger and then do your\nhold thing in your nose or whatever.\n\n365\n00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:44.784\nThat is an indication thatyYou know that\nI know the password, you know that I'm\n\n366\n00:18:44.784 --> 00:18:49.578\ngood for it, and then I'm allowed in\nbasically, so that's what I think of.\n\n367\n00:18:49.578 --> 00:18:51.888\nAnd I know there's keys-\n&gt;&gt; There are keys, yep.\n\n368\n00:18:51.888 --> 00:18:52.659\n&gt;&gt; There's a public key and a private key.\n\n369\n00:18:52.659 --> 00:18:54.731\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Dennis is smiling over here.\n\n370\n00:18:54.731 --> 00:18:55.863\n&gt;&gt; I'm so proud.\n\n371\n00:18:55.863 --> 00:18:59.148\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're on the right track, yeah, so\n\n372\n00:18:59.148 --> 00:19:03.530\nit's the same idea, that you have\nwhat are known as certificates.\n\n373\n00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:08.500\nYou have a certificate, it's like a birth\ncertificate that you as a person like\n\n374\n00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:14.100\nthis is me, and I'm going to send\na copy of my birth certificate or\n\n375\n00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:15.840\njust certificate,\nwe'll take that part off.\n\n376\n00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:20.550\nTo Daniel, to say hey this is me,\nthis is my identity so you know who I am.\n\n377\n00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:25.580\nWhen I sign my document over here\non this side, I'm signing it, and\n\n378\n00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:30.270\nI'm using that, that key that comes along\nwith the certificate to go ahead and\n\n379\n00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:33.600\nencrypt, or really just verify that I'm,\nthank you, yes,\n\n380\n00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:38.250\nhe did that, no no we're not encrypting,\nwe're just adding our stamp that says,\n\n381\n00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:41.290\nthis is me And then,\nI send it off to Daniel.\n\n382\n00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.070\nDaniel will be able to verify that yes,\n\n383\n00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:47.660\nit was definitely me,\nwho added the signature.\n\n384\n00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:52.150\nAnd it didn't get compromised along\nthe way because he has that copy.\n\n385\n00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:54.350\nAnd then, he sees me and\nthen, the copies match.\n\n386\n00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:56.600\nIt'll be like, yep, then, I've matched.\n\n387\n00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.690\n&gt;&gt; It verifies the sender.\n\n388\n00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:02.720\nAnd make sure that when Vonne sends me\nsomething, she sends me a workbook,\n\n389\n00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.940\nshe sends me a worksheet\nwhatever to open up in Excel.\n\n390\n00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:07.900\nI know it was Vonne that sent it,\n\n391\n00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:12.620\nbecause I can verify that through\nthe fact that she sent this key with it.\n\n392\n00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.300\nI'm going to decrypt that key.\n\n393\n00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:15.240\nIt's gonna have a hash value,\n\n394\n00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:19.330\nit's gonna have all this fun little\nsecurity terms all wrapped up in there.\n\n395\n00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:23.470\nAnd because of that I'll be able to go,\nwell that is Vonne,\n\n396\n00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:26.970\nbecause here's her public key and\nI've decrypted it using real public key.\n\n397\n00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:28.510\nThere is that, that is her.\n\n398\n00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:31.380\nOnly she has that so\nonly she could have sent it.\n\n399\n00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.090\nThat's the whole purpose of digital\nsignatures straight forward.\n\n400\n00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:35.971\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We're not getting too technical.\n\n401\n00:20:35.971 --> 00:20:37.370\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz it can get way down.\n\n402\n00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:38.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We can go down that rabbit\n\n403\n00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:39.890\nhole pretty quickly.\n\n404\n00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:43.550\nAnd really if you just consult to\nOracle about digital signatures,\n\n405\n00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:46.262\nI mean there is a lot of\ngood information about it.\n\n406\n00:20:46.262 --> 00:20:48.080\nBut that is the nuts and\nbolts of how it all works.\n\n407\n00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.730\n&gt;&gt; Well, like you said this is\nsomething you wanna consult\n\n408\n00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:53.100\nyour local administrator for whatever.\n\n409\n00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:55.460\nYou say, I want to implement\ndigital signatures on this.\n\n410\n00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:59.090\nI want to start verifying integrity of\nthe senders that are sending me things so\n\n411\n00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:03.330\nthat I don't open a workbook that has\nmalicious something or other inside of it.\n\n412\n00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:05.670\nI want to know that Vonne sent\nthat to me I trust Vonne,\n\n413\n00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:08.640\nI don't trust somebody who's\npretending to be Vonne and\n\n414\n00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:12.260\nthat's when you get them involved\n&gt;&gt; And with your network they might have\n\n415\n00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:16.790\na place where they store\nwhere your certificates live,\n\n416\n00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:20.140\nlike where your certificates are,\nwhere other people certificates.\n\n417\n00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:23.160\nAnd if I click on this just to show you,\n\n418\n00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.410\nit doesn't say using any\ncertificates are available.\n\n419\n00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:27.732\nOkay, great, wonderful.\n\n420\n00:21:27.732 --> 00:21:28.244\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n421\n00:21:28.244 --> 00:21:28.814\n&gt;&gt; Well, guess what,\n\n422\n00:21:28.814 --> 00:21:29.824\nI can't even do it.\n&gt;&gt; Not\n\n423\n00:21:29.824 --> 00:21:30.364\non this one.\n[LAUGH]\n\n424\n00:21:30.364 --> 00:21:31.794\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know, and this isn't just for\n\n425\n00:21:31.794 --> 00:21:33.474\nExcel.\nI mean, this is just for anything.\n\n426\n00:21:33.474 --> 00:21:35.824\nI mean, this is for PDFs, Word documents.\n\n427\n00:21:35.824 --> 00:21:36.904\nWe've talked about this,\n\n428\n00:21:36.904 --> 00:21:40.800\nI think in almost Office series\nwith PowerPoint and Word.\n\n429\n00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:41.380\nI know you and\n\n430\n00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:45.790\nI talked about it on the Word series as\nwell so if you want even more information.\n\n431\n00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:47.867\nI think we went a little\ndeeper in the Word one.\n\n432\n00:21:47.867 --> 00:21:51.421\n&gt;&gt; We did, we did dive just a bit inside\nthe Word one, it was a lot of fun but\n\n433\n00:21:51.421 --> 00:21:54.676\nit does get a little technical,\nnot like 100% necessary for\n\n434\n00:21:54.676 --> 00:21:57.707\nyou guys to know how it works,\nso just why you would need it.\n\n435\n00:21:57.707 --> 00:22:01.941\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it is one of those if your IT\nperson's like this is how you do it you\n\n436\n00:22:01.941 --> 00:22:06.599\njust click here, click there, do this, and\nyou go okay [NOISE] and it works [LAUGH].\n\n437\n00:22:06.599 --> 00:22:11.370\nSo it is one that you would need help\nwith if you're in a network environment.\n\n438\n00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:15.430\nAnd there's a lot of good reasons for\nit but, like Daniel said, and\n\n439\n00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:18.970\nlike this one actually is\nit ensure the integrity\n\n440\n00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:22.500\nof the file by adding this signature and\nmaking sure it matches up.\n\n441\n00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.440\nJust like we have with any signature.\n\n442\n00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:27.480\nIt's like, we're like, here's your\ndriver's license, go ahead and sign it but\n\n443\n00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:30.480\nthem my signature has changed so\nmuch [LAUGH].\n\n444\n00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.350\n&gt;&gt; Really, I'm like-\n&gt;&gt; That's the great thing\n\n445\n00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:36.250\nabout digital signatures, they don't\nchange, they're always the same thing.\n\n446\n00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:40.120\nI can always verify that it's Vonne, and\nanybody trying to pretend to be Vonne I'm\n\n447\n00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:43.430\ngonna go, well guess what, your signature\ndoesn't even come close to matching,\n\n448\n00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:46.070\nbecause that's the great thing\nabout encryption and hash value.\n\n449\n00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:49.480\nYou make one little minute\nchange in a hash value and\n\n450\n00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.420\nthe hash value is different.\n\n451\n00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:56.281\nSo if Vonne signed her signature with\none piece of data and you hashed it,\n\n452\n00:22:56.281 --> 00:22:59.002\nthat hash is gonna be that hash forever.\n\n453\n00:22:59.002 --> 00:23:00.443\nAnd if anybody changes it,\n\n454\n00:23:00.443 --> 00:23:03.680\neven by one character that hash\nvalue is gonna be off by a lot.\n\n455\n00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.065\nI'm gonna go no, that's not\nthe correct thing, that's not Vonne,\n\n456\n00:23:06.065 --> 00:23:07.370\nI am not opening it.\n\n457\n00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:08.920\n&gt;&gt; Right, computers are so smart.\n\n458\n00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but those are all the different\n\n459\n00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:15.460\nlevels of security that you\ncan add on a document, or\n\n460\n00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:16.960\nin this case we're\ntalking about workbooks.\n\n461\n00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.960\nBut it still is document security,\nworkbook security.\n\n462\n00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:24.130\nThis is actually the same in\nall of your Office products,\n\n463\n00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:28.450\nmaybe not the protecting sheets part,\nthat's very specific to Excel.\n\n464\n00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:33.530\nBut like I said, reoccurring themes\nwithin all of our Office Products,\n\n465\n00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:35.340\nbut the market is final, the IRM,\n\n466\n00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:39.280\nthe digital signature, and\nbeing able to encrypt it with a password.\n\n467\n00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:42.350\nSo hopefully that gives you\nlittle bit more security,\n\n468\n00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:44.840\nsome safe a secure for\nall of your information.\n\n469\n00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.500\nSo you can go out there and\ndon't even lose your passwords and\n\n470\n00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:50.168\nif you do, just send it to Daniel and\nhe'll crack it for you.\n\n471\n00:23:50.168 --> 00:23:51.176\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n472\n00:23:51.176 --> 00:23:53.370\n&gt;&gt; There are ways to get in.\n\n473\n00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:55.000\nAnd it is fun, it's a lot of fun.\n\n474\n00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.760\nI love security,\nit's a good time had by all.\n\n475\n00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:01.090\nBut so is Excel and security Excel makes\nsure that you use all these techniques\n\n476\n00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:05.290\nas needed inside of your environment\nsecure your worksheets make sure\n\n477\n00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:08.500\nthey don't get changed in\na way that you don't expect.\n\n478\n00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:09.614\nKeep them on lock down,\n\n479\n00:24:09.614 --> 00:24:12.692\nonly let the people that need\nthe access have the access, right?\n\n480\n00:24:12.692 --> 00:24:16.712\nVonne,thanks so much for walking us\nthrough the security that's built in\n\n481\n00:24:16.712 --> 00:24:19.022\ninside Excel 2016, very good stuff.\n\n482\n00:24:19.022 --> 00:24:20.870\nWe do thank our audience for watching.\n\n483\n00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:24.210\nBut guess what, it’s that time for\nus to sign off for OfficePro.TV.\n\n484\n00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:25.920\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n485\n00:24:25.920 -->

to\nanother great episode of Office Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.546 --> 00:00:14.079\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode, well guess what,\n\n5\n00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:17.010\nwe're back with more in our\nExcel 2016 advanced series.\n\n6\n00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.550\nThat's right.\n\n7\n00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.760\nThat's what we're here for,\nthat's what we're here to do.\n\n8\n00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.820\nAnd here to help us do that very thing,\nour good friend Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.040\nVonne, we're glad to have you, yet again.\n\n10\n00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.990\nHow's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.262\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing wonderful.\nI'm so glad to be back here and\n\n12\n00:00:28.262 --> 00:00:31.016\ntalk to you all about document properties.\n\n13\n00:00:31.016 --> 00:00:33.367\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That show we're gonna do.\n\n14\n00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:37.533\n&gt;&gt; I had it on my brain, and then I just-\n&gt;&gt; It just jumped out, it happens,\n\n15\n00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:38.042\nit happens.\n\n16\n00:00:38.042 --> 00:00:41.118\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, so it's good to have notes,\nalways good to have notes.\n\n17\n00:00:41.118 --> 00:00:42.288\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, always is.\n&gt;&gt; It's funny,\n\n18\n00:00:42.288 --> 00:00:46.008\nwe were just talking about that right\nbefore this episode about school and\n\n19\n00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:48.350\nwe started to have\nflashbacks of everything,\n\n20\n00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.190\nbecause we're gonna talk\nabout document properties.\n\n21\n00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.800\nAnd we started going through excuses\nof why we didn't do our homework and\n\n22\n00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.521\neverything.\n\n23\n00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:58.486\nI'm like, that's apropos for\nwhat we're gonna be talking about today.\n\n24\n00:00:58.486 --> 00:01:02.802\n[LAUGH] So yeah, but it did start to\ngive you some bad flashbacks and so\n\n25\n00:01:02.802 --> 00:01:05.110\nI went a little blank right there.\n\n26\n00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.140\nBut anyways, what we're talking\nabout are document properties and\n\n27\n00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.430\nif you've been watching the Word series or\nthe PowerPoint series.\n\n28\n00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.450\nAnd you saw an episode called\nDocument Properties there.\n\n29\n00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.490\nWell, guess what,\nwe're doing the same one here too.\n\n30\n00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.420\nBecause the document properties\nis the same thing in all of\n\n31\n00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.810\nyour Office Products, yes.\n\n32\n00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.210\nAnd so this is pretty much almost\nthe exact same show notes.\n\n33\n00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.300\nI think I just changed out the word,\nWord for Excel.\n\n34\n00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.080\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\n\n35\n00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.110\ntalk about the inspecting of our document,\nor I guess in this case, our workbook.\n\n36\n00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.390\nWe're also gonna be talking about\ncompatibility and accessibility.\n\n37\n00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.790\nWhat exactly are our document\nproperties going on here?\n\n38\n00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:46.828\nLet's start there.\n\n39\n00:01:46.828 --> 00:01:48.420\nDocument properties,\n\n40\n00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.040\nthat's where you can start adding\nin extra information to the file.\n\n41\n00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.069\nIt's more behind the scenes.\n\n42\n00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:56.842\nIt's called metadata.\n\n43\n00:01:56.842 --> 00:02:00.601\nMetadata is that stuff that you\ndon't see in the forefront,\n\n44\n00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:05.240\nlike the file name and\nthe location of where the file lives.\n\n45\n00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.210\nIt's information that you can add in the\nbackground, such as a title, or some tags.\n\n46\n00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.480\nOr, you can even create your own custom\nfields to be able to say that this\n\n47\n00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.900\nwas checked by or approved by\na specific manager or what have you.\n\n48\n00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.420\nAnd so you can use document properties\nin a lot of different ways.\n\n49\n00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.470\nAnd as we go through with showing you\nwhere they actually live in Excel,\n\n50\n00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.580\nthen we'll go through\nsome different scenarios.\n\n51\n00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.990\nWhy don't we just jump on down in here and\n\n52\n00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.670\nI have a file called document properties\nso we'll go ahead and get this open.\n\n53\n00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.090\nIt's the same document we've been working\non, I've added a few extra things in\n\n54\n00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.910\na different worksheets to go directly\nto the concept that we're going to be\n\n55\n00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.310\nlearning about in this particular episode\nwith the inspecting of the elements.\n\n56\n00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.150\nBut document properties always lives back\non that file tabs in our backstage view on\n\n57\n00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.376\nthe info, you can call this half or this\nsection that always comes up by default.\n\n58\n00:03:03.376 --> 00:03:07.310\nBut just in case it doesn't look like\nthis when you come to the backstage view,\n\n59\n00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.450\njust come over here to the left\nhand side and click on info and\n\n60\n00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.270\nyou can see these different things.\n\n61\n00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.800\nNow we've been here many, many times\nbefore coming into our Backstage view.\n\n62\n00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.566\nWe also talked about protected\ndocument in our document security and\n\n63\n00:03:21.566 --> 00:03:23.500\nwant it to be encrypting and\nso and and so forth.\n\n64\n00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.560\nBut we didn't really point out in that\nparticular episode about the things that's\n\n65\n00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.728\nover here on the right.\n\n66\n00:03:28.728 --> 00:03:33.940\nAnd it says, properties, yes this is where\nall of your document properties live.\n\n67\n00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.334\nAnd you can see things\nlike there is a title.\n\n68\n00:03:36.334 --> 00:03:39.410\nThere are some tags in here.\n\n69\n00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.502\nWe have some other ones, and\n\n70\n00:03:41.502 --> 00:03:47.357\nthis is where we're talking about back\nwith the whole thing that created date.\n\n71\n00:03:47.357 --> 00:03:51.542\nAnd I don't know, I never used this\nexcuse I use the my dog eat my homework.\n\n72\n00:03:51.542 --> 00:03:52.770\nDid you ever use that Daniel?\n\n73\n00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:58.821\n&gt;&gt; I wanted to really badly, but\nmy dog didn't eat a lot, so.\n\n74\n00:03:58.821 --> 00:04:00.296\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I felt like it was just\n\n75\n00:04:00.296 --> 00:04:01.701\ntoo much of a lie at that point.\n\n76\n00:04:01.701 --> 00:04:02.617\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n77\n00:04:02.617 --> 00:04:03.441\n&gt;&gt; Nobody would believe me.\n\n78\n00:04:03.441 --> 00:04:04.026\nCouldn't sell it.\n\n79\n00:04:04.026 --> 00:04:05.437\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the whole dog ate my.\n\n80\n00:04:05.437 --> 00:04:06.360\nIt's like, yeah.\n\n81\n00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.045\nI don't know.\nMaybe I just didn't have a dog that ate.\n\n82\n00:04:08.045 --> 00:04:09.657\n[LAUGH] That much either, but\n\n83\n00:04:09.657 --> 00:04:12.687\nthat was something you could\nalways say I didn't do.\n\n84\n00:04:12.687 --> 00:04:16.180\nI didn't have computers back in the day\nthat I would probably try to use the dog\n\n85\n00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.329\nate my homework excuse.\n\n86\n00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:17.968\n&gt;&gt; Aliens.\n\n87\n00:04:17.968 --> 00:04:18.874\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n88\n00:04:18.874 --> 00:04:19.847\n&gt;&gt; Aliens ate my homework.\n\n89\n00:04:19.847 --> 00:04:21.081\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That was way more\n\n90\n00:04:21.081 --> 00:04:22.198\nbelievable than the dog.\n\n91\n00:04:22.198 --> 00:04:24.505\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well I'm sure now a days\n\n92\n00:04:24.505 --> 00:04:28.227\nbecause I mean I think we had a computer\nwhen I was like in fourth grade,\n\n93\n00:04:28.227 --> 00:04:32.470\nbut it was like the Apple IIc, with\nthe green screen and everything like that.\n\n94\n00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.350\n&gt;&gt; Wow, you guy's were styling.\n\n95\n00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:34.215\n&gt;&gt; I know, right?\n\n96\n00:04:34.215 --> 00:04:36.310\n[LAUGH] it was really fancy.\n\n97\n00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.220\nI guess you can say in college, where I\ncan be like, well my computer crashed so\n\n98\n00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.510\nI couldn't get that file from the hard\ndrive to be able to turn into you,\n\n99\n00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.970\nso that's why my homework's late,\nor what have you, and so\n\n100\n00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.210\nyou go ahead and turn it in.\n\n101\n00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.600\nWell, if you send them a Word document,\nor what have you,\n\n102\n00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.880\nthey [LAUGH] can open up the Word document\nand look and see the created on date,\n\n103\n00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.860\nand if that created date is passed\nthe date that it was due, guess what?\n\n104\n00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.282\nYou didn't have it ready on time.\n\n105\n00:05:03.282 --> 00:05:06.609\n[LAUGH] ,you're late so-\n&gt;&gt; And your teacher is gonna be like, so\n\n106\n00:05:06.609 --> 00:05:08.823\nit seems like you're telling me lies.\n\n107\n00:05:08.823 --> 00:05:11.738\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No no no, swear I had it done before.I\n\n108\n00:05:11.738 --> 00:05:16.293\nbefore the due date and now it says\nright here, created on past that day.\n\n109\n00:05:16.293 --> 00:05:20.097\n&gt;&gt; See the thing was,and then\nthe lies continue, it gets worse.\n\n110\n00:05:20.097 --> 00:05:20.909\nAnd you dig yourself in.\n\n111\n00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:23.348\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And on that same notion,\n\n112\n00:05:23.348 --> 00:05:28.110\nwe come down here and part of the things\nthat you can look on the properties is\n\n113\n00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.939\nwho was it last modified by?\n\n114\n00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:33.168\nWell if that's not your name, guess what.\n\n115\n00:05:33.168 --> 00:05:35.887\nThen somebody else is\nwriting your paper for you.\n\n116\n00:05:35.887 --> 00:05:36.456\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n117\n00:05:36.456 --> 00:05:39.332\nThank goodness for papers by Raul, right?\n\n118\n00:05:39.332 --> 00:05:45.560\n&gt;&gt; Right, and you need to be careful about\ntaking documents from other sources.\n\n119\n00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.812\nBecause if someone went ahead and\nput in this metadata into the file,\n\n120\n00:05:49.812 --> 00:05:53.344\nyou can see all of this right\nhere in this backstage view.\n\n121\n00:05:53.344 --> 00:05:55.924\nSo just if you are gonna\nget anything anybody else,\n\n122\n00:05:55.924 --> 00:05:58.029\nyou need to make sure\nto take all this out.\n\n123\n00:05:58.029 --> 00:06:00.772\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Are we able to srub that data and\n\n124\n00:06:00.772 --> 00:06:04.240\nsay you know what, I want to know\nthat I wrote this morning and\n\n125\n00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.736\nit was due three days ago.\n\n126\n00:06:05.736 --> 00:06:09.208\n&gt;&gt; Funny you should say that,\nbecause that's part of this episode,\n\n127\n00:06:09.208 --> 00:06:13.238\nwhere we inspect a document and we can\ninspect for the document properties and\n\n128\n00:06:13.238 --> 00:06:16.466\nthen there's going to be a little\nbutton that says, Remove.\n\n129\n00:06:16.466 --> 00:06:16.993\n&gt;&gt; So yes.\n\n130\n00:06:16.993 --> 00:06:19.484\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n131\n00:06:19.484 --> 00:06:23.697\nwe're not trying to promote\ncheating right now.\n\n132\n00:06:23.697 --> 00:06:27.300\n&gt;&gt; Big wink, nudge nudge.\n\n133\n00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.216\nDon't you dare, mm-mm.\n\n134\n00:06:30.216 --> 00:06:35.144\n&gt;&gt; We're just protecting us all and\njust really emphasizing the whole\n\n135\n00:06:35.144 --> 00:06:40.680\nfact that there's meta data within\nthis file that can be used for good.\n\n136\n00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.510\nLet's turn this around,\n\n137\n00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:42.073\n&gt;&gt; Yes\n&gt;&gt; different scenario.\n\n138\n00:06:42.073 --> 00:06:46.211\nI've taught many different people\nthroughout the years and I had people who\n\n139\n00:06:46.211 --> 00:06:51.011\nwere in different law firms and they said,\nwe've used this to the ninth degree here.\n\n140\n00:06:51.011 --> 00:06:54.700\nIn the sense of who was the person\nwho recorded the information?\n\n141\n00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.111\nWho was the one who checked it?\n\n142\n00:06:56.111 --> 00:07:00.100\nThey put all of the different metadata\ninto here because if you think about\n\n143\n00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.200\nlaw and different cases,\nthis could be very important.\n\n144\n00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.042\nIf these are legal documents, you need to\nmake sure you have all of those different\n\n145\n00:07:07.042 --> 00:07:09.559\ndocumentations as to where\nthis document came from.\n\n146\n00:07:09.559 --> 00:07:13.227\nSo I could see that being\nreally important in here.\n\n147\n00:07:13.227 --> 00:07:16.492\nAnd now you can see,\nin this particular file,\n\n148\n00:07:16.492 --> 00:07:19.693\nthat I have a title,\nI have some tags in here.\n\n149\n00:07:19.693 --> 00:07:23.998\nAnd there's actually some other things in\nhere that you can't see in this particular\n\n150\n00:07:23.998 --> 00:07:27.189\nscreen, because we need to into\nall the advanced properties.\n\n151\n00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:31.222\nIf you click up there at the top\nwhere it says advanced properties,\n\n152\n00:07:31.222 --> 00:07:34.310\nbrings us into this\nparticular dialogue box.\n\n153\n00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:37.024\nI put in a company, I put in OfficeProTV.\n\n154\n00:07:37.024 --> 00:07:43.505\nI put in some key words in here,\ntags, Excel, inspect, accessibility.\n\n155\n00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:46.250\nSo these are things that would come up and\n\n156\n00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:50.142\nthis is kind of a cool thing\ninto your document searches.\n\n157\n00:07:50.142 --> 00:07:53.761\nSo you can see that the word\ninspect is a keyword, but\n\n158\n00:07:53.761 --> 00:07:56.074\nthat's not the name of the file.\n\n159\n00:07:56.074 --> 00:07:57.522\nThe file says, document properties.\n\n160\n00:07:57.522 --> 00:07:59.444\nI'm gonna close this\njust to demonstrate this.\n\n161\n00:07:59.444 --> 00:08:04.797\nDown at the bottom in your search,\nif I typed in Inspect into.\n\n162\n00:08:04.797 --> 00:08:07.187\nWell, let's [LAUGH] let's try and\nspell it.\n\n163\n00:08:07.187 --> 00:08:09.097\nInspect, there we go.\n\n164\n00:08:09.097 --> 00:08:12.528\nWell, that didn't to anything\nthat you said it would, Vonne.\n\n165\n00:08:12.528 --> 00:08:15.141\nWell, that's because you have\nsome little buttons up here.\n\n166\n00:08:15.141 --> 00:08:17.573\nYou see how, like, what am I searching in?\n\n167\n00:08:17.573 --> 00:08:20.901\nLike apps, files, documents, right?\n\n168\n00:08:20.901 --> 00:08:23.255\nWhat are my files in the computer?\n\n169\n00:08:23.255 --> 00:08:27.420\nIf I click on that, look at what comes up,\nDocument Properties.\n\n170\n00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:28.840\nWhy did it come up, that's not the name?\n\n171\n00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.688\nIt's because of that metadata.\n\n172\n00:08:30.688 --> 00:08:34.817\nSo your computer can actually use\nthis metadata for searching and\n\n173\n00:08:34.817 --> 00:08:36.549\nindexing and everything.\n\n174\n00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:41.528\nSo it has other capabilities besides, okay\nlet's, we don't work in a law firm and\n\n175\n00:08:41.528 --> 00:08:45.210\nwe don't wanna cheat on our homework and\nall that kinda stuff.\n\n176\n00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:51.380\nIt has other things so this kinda all ties\ntogether with those document properties.\n\n177\n00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:56.106\nWhy don't we go ahead and open the file\nright from here, and come back into this.\n\n178\n00:08:56.106 --> 00:08:59.754\nAnd this is another thing, kinda back to\nthat law firm, is that if you fill in\n\n179\n00:08:59.754 --> 00:09:03.354\nthese document properties, you could\nalways make templates off of this.\n\n180\n00:09:03.354 --> 00:09:08.605\nWe talked about that in our\nExcel Essentials episodes.\n\n181\n00:09:08.605 --> 00:09:11.955\nI think it was in File Types where we\ntalked about saving as a template,\n\n182\n00:09:11.955 --> 00:09:14.915\nwhere we could go ahead and\nmake our own new file off of that.\n\n183\n00:09:14.915 --> 00:09:17.390\nAnd you can go ahead and\nfill in those things.\n\n184\n00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.830\nIf adding document properties and\nkey words and\n\n185\n00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:24.357\ntags is something that is\npart of your work flow.\n\n186\n00:09:24.357 --> 00:09:26.658\nAnd one last thing, and\njust to show you Daniel,\n\n187\n00:09:26.658 --> 00:09:30.445\nI actually made you your own little\ntag in here, your own little category.\n\n188\n00:09:30.445 --> 00:09:31.825\n&gt;&gt; Look at me, I'm an author.\n\n189\n00:09:31.825 --> 00:09:33.163\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You are.\n\n190\n00:09:33.163 --> 00:09:33.900\nWhat did I have?\n\n191\n00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:34.650\n&gt;&gt; I'm something.\n\n192\n00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.120\n&gt;&gt; It was checked by you.\n\n193\n00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.406\nIt was checked by Daniel\n&gt;&gt; I'm an editor-\n\n194\n00:09:38.406 --> 00:09:39.096\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n195\n00:09:39.096 --> 00:09:43.928\nyou can think that that whole idea of\nlike working in a law firm you can see a,\n\n196\n00:09:43.928 --> 00:09:47.169\ndeposition and\nalso destination, department.\n\n197\n00:09:47.169 --> 00:09:52.103\nYou can have these different tags or you\ncould take and make your own custom tags\n\n198\n00:09:52.103 --> 00:09:56.885\nby adding like what is the name the type\nand the value and the added into here so\n\n199\n00:09:56.885 --> 00:10:01.073\nI think that's pretty neat In all\nof your different statistics and\n\n200\n00:10:01.073 --> 00:10:03.060\ndocument properties, cool.\n\n201\n00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.665\nSo now we know where there at,\nwhere we need to look for them,\n\n202\n00:10:06.665 --> 00:10:11.260\nwhy we want to use them and [LAUGH] how\ngetting back to when you're getting rid of\n\n203\n00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:12.978\nall the information [LAUGH].\n\n204\n00:10:12.978 --> 00:10:14.334\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because we don't want that as\n\n205\n00:10:14.334 --> 00:10:14.915\na part of it.\n\n206\n00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.880\nOver here in the info section,\nwe have inspect or book.\n\n207\n00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:24.370\nSo think about like what inspect really\nmeans, what we're checking it out.\n\n208\n00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:26.462\nI'm holding it up like a magnifying glass.\n\n209\n00:10:26.462 --> 00:10:27.831\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] What we really\n\n210\n00:10:27.831 --> 00:10:28.426\nmean\n&gt;&gt; She's mad.\n\n211\n00:10:28.426 --> 00:10:31.222\n[LAUGH] You get your fist\nin front of your face.\n\n212\n00:10:31.222 --> 00:10:32.751\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Like in the old school\n\n213\n00:10:32.751 --> 00:10:34.043\nSherlock Holmes\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n214\n00:10:34.043 --> 00:10:35.741\nSomebody's watching this\nwith the sound off,\n\n215\n00:10:35.741 --> 00:10:37.232\ngoing why is she trying to hit the screen?\n\n216\n00:10:37.232 --> 00:10:40.859\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] She's got some problems\n\n217\n00:10:40.859 --> 00:10:41.390\n[LAUGH].\n\n218\n00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.920\nSo what you have before you\nis the Document Inspector.\n\n219\n00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.110\nMake sure you've saved your changes,\n\n220\n00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:51.710\nbecause the Document Inspector might\nremove data that cannot be restored later.\n\n221\n00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:53.110\nGood, thank you for letting me know that.\n\n222\n00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.240\nAnd it's gonna come out here.\n\n223\n00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.810\nSame thing that we do in Word,\nin PowerPoint and\n\n224\n00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:01.940\na whole bunch varied other different\nOffice Products whether it's going to go\n\n225\n00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:04.990\nand look for\ndifferent things within your workbook.\n\n226\n00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:08.110\nAnd if we look through some of that,\nit's gonna look for comments,\n\n227\n00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:11.670\nit's gonna look for\nadd-ins, and, right there.\n\n228\n00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:14.480\nDocuments, Properties,\nand Personal Information.\n\n229\n00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:19.990\nAnd we go through some of these\nother ones Pivot tables, macros,\n\n230\n00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:25.400\nlinks to other files,\nthere is hidden names, this was ones.\n\n231\n00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.250\nHidden rows or columns or worksheets,\n\n232\n00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:30.550\ncuz we talked about how like\nyou could hide a worksheet and\n\n233\n00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:34.530\nif you didn't know that you could unhide,\nwell how would you know that its there?\n\n234\n00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:36.840\nWe inspect the document.\n\n235\n00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.390\nSo, let's go ahead and run this.\n\n236\n00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:41.014\nWe will inspect it, and then,\nthen it goes through and\n\n237\n00:11:41.014 --> 00:11:43.140\ngives us a little report\nas to what it found.\n\n238\n00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.600\nIt found a comment.\n\n239\n00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:48.301\nIt found that document, and,\nright there, remove all,\n\n240\n00:11:48.301 --> 00:11:51.409\nthat's what we're gonna\nwanna do to this file.\n\n241\n00:11:51.409 --> 00:11:55.407\nIt did see that it had a pivot table\nwithin this particular file, and yep,\n\n242\n00:11:55.407 --> 00:11:59.877\nI did hide some row, and columns, and some\nworksheets in here, so you can see it.\n\n243\n00:11:59.877 --> 00:12:04.613\nAnd it actually said I found one hidden\nworksheet, I found two columns where\n\n244\n00:12:04.613 --> 00:12:08.247\nI have hid the information so\nyou can kind of go on through.\n\n245\n00:12:08.247 --> 00:12:12.253\nNow for this particular example,\nI'm not going to click the remove all,\n\n246\n00:12:12.253 --> 00:12:16.578\nbecause just in case, like that warning\nthat it gave me right before we stared,\n\n247\n00:12:16.578 --> 00:12:19.570\nhey it could go ahead and\nremove it and not be restored.\n\n248\n00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:24.179\nSo I want you guys to still be able to\nhave this file intact when we go ahead and\n\n249\n00:12:24.179 --> 00:12:26.580\nfollow along in the course library.\n\n250\n00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:27.670\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and close this.\n\n251\n00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:30.350\nBut you can see how cool it is and\nit's really simple.\n\n252\n00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:33.350\nJust inspect, go ahead and\ngive me a report, and I can pick and\n\n253\n00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:38.200\nchoose whether I want to removed it or\nunhide it, or go to the different places.\n\n254\n00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:43.292\nSo good thing to do to scrub out all\nthat information from papers, from Raul.\n\n255\n00:12:43.292 --> 00:12:45.905\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right lets go to over to\n\n256\n00:12:45.905 --> 00:12:50.250\naccessibility, another\nchecker that we can do.\n\n257\n00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:51.230\nCheck the content for\n\n258\n00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:54.440\npeople with disabilities that\nmight find it difficult to read.\n\n259\n00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:58.310\nSo this also came up when we\nwere doing images, right?\n\n260\n00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:03.060\nWe talked about the alternate text and\nhow important it is to label or\n\n261\n00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.730\nadd a description to your images for\n\n262\n00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:09.300\npeople that are having\nthe information read to them.\n\n263\n00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:13.580\nThey're not seeing the information, so\nit is being conveyed to them through\n\n264\n00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:17.800\na different combination of software and\nhardware to read your content.\n\n265\n00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:22.320\nAnd so this accessibility checker is\nsomething that's really good to have.\n\n266\n00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:26.210\nAnd notice over here on\nthe accessibility checker task pane,\n\n267\n00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:30.610\nyou can see that our report says that\nI have missing alternative text.\n\n268\n00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:33.080\nThat's always going to be\na really big one on there.\n\n269\n00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.248\nAnd then another one,\nlook it has merged cells.\n\n270\n00:13:35.248 --> 00:13:39.830\nMerged cells is something that\nis discouraged in accessibility.\n\n271\n00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:43.810\nAnd if you click on each\none of them its gonna\n\n272\n00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:46.930\ngo to the specific areas like\nthis is format as a table.\n\n273\n00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:50.480\nThis is where Mr Fuego Pants\nis hanging out right there.\n\n274\n00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:54.290\nThis is where with the chart like is it\nthat chart is a visual elements, like its\n\n275\n00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:58.720\ntelling us information visually so we need\nto be able to Add descriptions to that.\n\n276\n00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.780\nBut the nice thing is, and it's actually\nbehind my head so you can see, each time\n\n277\n00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:07.360\nthat you're clicking on one of these\nit's giving you why you should fix this.\n\n278\n00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:13.106\nAnd so I like that it's giving the\nexplanations for this and how to do it.\n\n279\n00:14:13.106 --> 00:14:14.961\nAnd if you click on this link,\n\n280\n00:14:14.961 --> 00:14:18.823\nthis is one that you should really\nkind of start looking for and\n\n281\n00:14:18.823 --> 00:14:24.191\nevery organization has different rules on\nhow accessible your documents should be.\n\n282\n00:14:24.191 --> 00:14:28.940\nBut this is a very important topic, and\nit's one of those if you just take a few\n\n283\n00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:33.251\nsteps, like adding alternate text\nto your images, and the big ones,\n\n284\n00:14:33.251 --> 00:14:35.810\nyou can really make it fully accessible or\n\n285\n00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:40.370\nat least mostly accessible to most people,\nand that can be really handy.\n\n286\n00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:43.610\nAnd especially if you're working in\na government agency, it's a big deal.\n\n287\n00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:49.770\nAnd so I like how it's gonna list all\nthe different places of what's a fix,\n\n288\n00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:51.891\nwhy to fix it, how to do it, and\n\n289\n00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:56.560\nit's just taking it out to the different\nhelp files on the website.\n\n290\n00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.210\nSo definitely read up on this.\n\n291\n00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:02.030\nIt's got a lot of good references and\na lot of good information for\n\n292\n00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:06.160\nmaking your documents ADA compliant or\nmaking it for\n\n293\n00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:12.100\nyou have accessibility checked\noff that you have done that.\n\n294\n00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:16.290\nSo, and the last one that we can do\nover here on the Info is checking for\n\n295\n00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:17.350\ncompatibility.\n\n296\n00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:19.620\nNow, this one's gonna be\na really interesting report.\n\n297\n00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:20.382\nNow what does this mean?\n\n298\n00:15:20.382 --> 00:15:28.648\nCompatibility would be an older version of\nExcel that holds XLS file versus the XSLX.\n\n299\n00:15:28.648 --> 00:15:33.446\nThis is something we talked about\nin I think the first episode of\n\n300\n00:15:33.446 --> 00:15:35.264\nthe Excel essentials.\n\n301\n00:15:35.264 --> 00:15:38.798\nWe were going over what is Excel, and\nwhat does it mean in different versions.\n\n302\n00:15:38.798 --> 00:15:43.849\nNow Excel has an XLS file\nthat was before 2007,\n\n303\n00:15:43.849 --> 00:15:46.560\nso that's a long time ago.\n\n304\n00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.127\n&gt;&gt; A while back.\n\n305\n00:15:47.127 --> 00:15:51.378\n&gt;&gt; It was a while back, so how many\npeople are still using Excel 2000?\n\n306\n00:15:51.378 --> 00:15:52.963\nOr Excel 2002.\n\n307\n00:15:52.963 --> 00:15:53.734\n&gt;&gt; Four million.\n\n308\n00:15:53.734 --> 00:15:56.088\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n309\n00:15:56.088 --> 00:15:57.387\n&gt;&gt; You know-\n\n310\n00:15:57.387 --> 00:15:58.284\n&gt;&gt; You'd be probably be surprise\n\n311\n00:15:58.284 --> 00:15:59.775\nat how many people are still\nusing older versions.\n\n312\n00:15:59.775 --> 00:16:04.075\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean we talked about that\nwith operating systems all the time and\n\n313\n00:16:04.075 --> 00:16:08.674\nlike you shouldn't be on like Windows\n2000s, its probably a bad thing.\n\n314\n00:16:08.674 --> 00:16:12.838\nSo this is one of those, its still out\nthere though so its good to check.\n\n315\n00:16:12.838 --> 00:16:16.507\nSo it's gonna run a report just\nlike it did with our inspecting and\n\n316\n00:16:16.507 --> 00:16:21.311\nour accessibility to where it says, well\nsome of these things that you've formatted\n\n317\n00:16:21.311 --> 00:16:25.070\non your chart are not gonna be\nsupported on earlier versions.\n\n318\n00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:27.880\nThis has a scalable vector graphic or\nSVGs.\n\n319\n00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.674\nThat's for the little icon for\n\n320\n00:16:29.674 --> 00:16:32.918\nthe cat we talked about that\nin the graphical elements.\n\n321\n00:16:32.918 --> 00:16:35.460\nFormatting as tables,\nand look at this list.\n\n322\n00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:39.490\nIt's just like pretty much everything\nin your document is not going to be\n\n323\n00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:44.170\ncompatible with our pivot tables and\nthen the cell styles and the formatting.\n\n324\n00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:47.470\nSo we're gonna have to fix this.\n\n325\n00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:51.930\nThe nice thing is that this is something\nyou do have to be aware of and\n\n326\n00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:54.970\nbe saving it down into an XLS file.\n\n327\n00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:59.837\nIt's nice that it will go ahead and give\nyou links out to websites that will give\n\n328\n00:16:59.837 --> 00:17:03.470\nyou help on how to you can fix it and\nwhat you can do about it.\n\n329\n00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:06.155\nWe're not going to fix anything on here,\nbut\n\n330\n00:17:06.155 --> 00:17:10.420\ndefinitely check out those links\nif you need more information.\n\n331\n00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:14.589\nAnd so that really covers all of the\ndifferent things in my notes that I've had\n\n332\n00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:18.971\nfor talking about document properties,\nwhere to find it, why you want to do it.\n\n333\n00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:23.322\nInspecting, really easy, just run a\nreport, staying with our accessibility and\n\n334\n00:17:23.322 --> 00:17:26.692\nreading up on all the information and\nfor the

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Lovely,\n\n17\n00:00:30.858 --> 00:00:33.903\nso-\n&gt;&gt; Pick a positive adjective.\n\n18\n00:00:33.903 --> 00:00:34.585\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n19\n00:00:34.585 --> 00:00:35.088\n&gt;&gt; All of the above.\n\n20\n00:00:35.088 --> 00:00:35.592\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n21\n00:00:35.592 --> 00:00:36.740\n&gt;&gt; So in this episode\n\n22\n00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.610\nwe're gonna be talking about\ncustomizing the interface.\n\n23\n00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.530\nNow we've touch on a little\nbit of these things here and\n\n24\n00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.240\nthere in the essential series where we are\ngetting familiar with the interface and\n\n25\n00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.670\ngoing over like, what is the ribbon?\n\n26\n00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.090\nWhat is the quick access toolbar?\n\n27\n00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.205\nAnd we add added a few things\non that quick access toolbar.\n\n28\n00:00:55.205 --> 00:00:57.185\nBut we're going to take\nit one step further and\n\n29\n00:00:57.185 --> 00:00:59.745\nwe are going to start\ncustomizing our ribbon.\n\n30\n00:00:59.745 --> 00:01:03.225\nAnd I do want to go through some of the\nExcel options to be able to customize our\n\n31\n00:01:03.225 --> 00:01:04.770\ninterface a little bit more.\n\n32\n00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.760\nThere's a ton of things in the options.\n\n33\n00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.960\nSo, we're not gonna be covering\nevery single one line by line,\n\n34\n00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.700\nbut just maybe pointing\nout a few things so\n\n35\n00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.130\nyou just start getting comfortable going\nover and say, hmm, well, can I do that?\n\n36\n00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.490\nLet me check the options.\n\n37\n00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.620\nAnd, there's an option\nright there that we can do.\n\n38\n00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.690\nSo let's come on in to our\nChristmas cats example file.\n\n39\n00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.870\nNow the file itself doesn't really\nmatter as to which one is open.\n\n40\n00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.620\nI just picked this one because,\n&gt;&gt; You like Christmas cats.\n\n41\n00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.440\nLet's just be honest.\n\n42\n00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.501\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\nYou know it's\n\n43\n00:01:35.501 --> 00:01:38.370\nbeen the file file of the show for\nmultiple shows and\n\n44\n00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.315\nyou'll probably keep seeing\nit in other shows too.\n\n45\n00:01:41.315 --> 00:01:44.497\nSo [LAUGH] just different\nways that we can go ahead and\n\n46\n00:01:44.497 --> 00:01:46.649\nexemplify our different topics.\n\n47\n00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.360\nSo let's talk about the ribbon and\nthe quick access toolbar and\n\n48\n00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.840\nhow we can customize it.\n\n49\n00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.126\nNow, going from the essentials series,\n\n50\n00:01:54.126 --> 00:01:56.815\nwe have our quick access\ntoolbar across the top.\n\n51\n00:01:56.815 --> 00:02:00.804\nAnd you can see that I've added\na couple different buttons on the quick\n\n52\n00:02:00.804 --> 00:02:02.364\naccess toolbar there too.\n\n53\n00:02:02.364 --> 00:02:07.170\nIf I want to insert an icon.I want to have\nit through there on quick access toolbar.\n\n54\n00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.310\nHow can I customize it?\n\n55\n00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.070\nI can come over to the drop-down at the\nend, come into here, and if I don't have\n\n56\n00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:20.130\nany of these most commonly used items on\nthe drop-down, I can go to more commands.\n\n57\n00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.200\nAnd then we come out to well,\nthe Excel options.\n\n58\n00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.720\nSo we could have gotten to this\nfrom going to the file and\n\n59\n00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.410\ngoing to options and then going to\nthe quick access toolbar, right?\n\n60\n00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.460\nSo this is a little bit of a review.\n\n61\n00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.380\nSome of the things that were there,\nthe show option or\n\n62\n00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.720\nshow the toolbar below the ribbon,\nnot the bottom, that's there.\n\n63\n00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.190\nWe can go ahead and start adding\ndifferent commands and put them there.\n\n64\n00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.530\nAnd you can load this thing up,\n\n65\n00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.990\nreally until it reaches a point where you\ncan't see anymore of the options in one\n\n66\n00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.690\nscreenshot if you want to say,\ndepending on your resolution.\n\n67\n00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.600\nBut you do need to make sure that you pick\n\n68\n00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.830\nwhat tab on the ribbon this\nparticularly command comes from.\n\n69\n00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.960\nSo if I was going to be\ngoing on the review tab,\n\n70\n00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.880\ncuz maybe something that I do on,\nwell it just says separator.\n\n71\n00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.920\nSo, [LAUGH] why don't we\ngo to the insert tab and\n\n72\n00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.100\nthat says separator, well one,\nwhere are you going there, guy?\n\n73\n00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.040\n&gt;&gt; Choose one at random\n&gt;&gt; How about we go with all commands?\n\n74\n00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.290\nThere we go.\nWhen in doubt just go in an alphabetized\n\n75\n00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.450\nlist because,\nI really use the auto sum a lot, so\n\n76\n00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.809\nlet's go ahead and\nadd that on over to there.\n\n77\n00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.513\nAnd then maybe I want the auto sum\nto be one of the like first buttons,\n\n78\n00:03:32.513 --> 00:03:34.460\nlike right next to the save button.\n\n79\n00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.820\nSo you see you got a little bumpy areas\nover here to where you can go ahead and\n\n80\n00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.410\nreorganized, restructure what\ncommands you want where on that\n\n81\n00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.440\nparticular quick access tool bar.\n\n82\n00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.410\nAnd then maybe I don't want to have\nthe insert icons on their anymore, so\n\n83\n00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.160\nyou can come over here and\nyou can remove it back and forth.\n\n84\n00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.820\nSo going ahead and\ngetting that set is good.\n\n85\n00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.700\nI would like to talk\na little bit about down here\n\n86\n00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.580\ninto our customizations where we have\nreset and then import and export.\n\n87\n00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.200\nAnd notice on the reset we have\nonly the quick access toolbar or\n\n88\n00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.060\nall of our customizations.\n\n89\n00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.980\nSo that's something to where when\nwe get into customizing the ribbon,\n\n90\n00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.180\nbecause that's part of our interface,\nthat's where you get to pick and choose.\n\n91\n00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.380\nJust this part, don't touch the ribbon, or\nyou know what, just do the whole thing,\n\n92\n00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.020\nthe whole kitten caboodle and put\neverything back to its factory settings,\n\n93\n00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.106\nbecause we get in there and\n\n94\n00:04:28.106 --> 00:04:29.700\ngussy it up a little too much-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n95\n00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.590\n&gt;&gt; When you back out, so we can do that.\n\n96\n00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.590\nAnother one you have is the import and\nexport.\n\n97\n00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.120\nThis is where,\nsay I'm switching computers or\n\n98\n00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.290\nI'm setting an interface that I would\nlike all of my users to be able\n\n99\n00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.830\nto have cuz I put a bunch of buttons\nthat we're always gonna be creating.\n\n100\n00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.470\nSo you can, I mean there's different\nscenarios as to why you'd wanna do this.\n\n101\n00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.560\nBut what you wanna do is you can\nexport all the customizations in here.\n\n102\n00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.680\nLet's go ahead and do that just for fun.\n\n103\n00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.570\nWe will export this.\n\n104\n00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.870\nNotice that it's gonna export this\nout as an exported Office UI file.\n\n105\n00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:07.180\nSo this is a very specific\nfile format that only another\n\n106\n00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.760\nOffice Excel file or an Office Excel\nprogram would be able to come and\n\n107\n00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.040\nthen import this particular UI file.\n\n108\n00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.600\nBecause it does say Excel customizations,\n\n109\n00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.130\nit's not going to be all of\nyour Office customizations.\n\n110\n00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.010\nSo I'm not going to say\ndefinite on this one,\n\n111\n00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.300\nbecause I would actually\nprobably need to go out and\n\n112\n00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.510\nsee, is this going to be across all\nof your programs or just Excel?\n\n113\n00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.066\nI'm gonna-\n&gt;&gt; I'll put my money on just Excel.\n\n114\n00:05:37.066 --> 00:05:41.050\n&gt;&gt; I am too, but\nwe're gonna just keep that asterisk there.\n\n115\n00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n116\n00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.170\n&gt;&gt; At the end of everything, just in case.\n\n117\n00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.860\nBut you can see that once-\n\n118\n00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.291\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n119\n00:05:47.291 --> 00:05:48.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Really really fast.\n\n120\n00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.085\ntalk talk talk.\nDisclaimer, disclaimer.\n\n121\n00:05:50.085 --> 00:05:54.880\n[LAUGH] So we've got that and\nI can save it somewhere and then go ahead.\n\n122\n00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.230\nAnd then on the other computer,\nget that same file.\n\n123\n00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.250\nAnd I have actually done this,\nbetween Justin and Joey and\n\n124\n00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.620\nLance and just email the file\nwhen I had emailed Joey,\n\n125\n00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.540\nattach this, brought in to Joey,\nbrought it down, put it right into Word.\n\n126\n00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.890\nI think I was doing it with Word Note,\nyep, it works totally fine.\n\n127\n00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.010\nSo that's what that import and\nexport button is down there.\n\n128\n00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.580\nAnd it's all of your customization,\nit's not just the quick access toolbar.\n\n129\n00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:26.490\nAnd you can actually see on the tool set,\nyour ribbon and quick access toolbar.\n\n130\n00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.170\nSo good to know.\n\n131\n00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.240\nLet's come over here to the ribbon,\n\n132\n00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.440\nbecause that's another thing you can come\ninto to start customizing your interface.\n\n133\n00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.570\nOne of the things, like when we get\ninto macros, or if you wanted to record\n\n134\n00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:43.460\na macro, you're not gonna be able to see\nthe click and record macro button or\n\n135\n00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.260\nsome of the other options because your\ndeveloper tab is not on your ribbon.\n\n136\n00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.600\nIt's not on by default and\nin really any of your Office products.\n\n137\n00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.280\nBut it's there.\n\n138\n00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.740\nYou just have to come in here to\nthe Excel options and turn it on.\n\n139\n00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.590\nSo if I check that box off right there,\nhere's my developer ribbon,\n\n140\n00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.290\nand then I can go ahead and see that.\n\n141\n00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:06.400\nLet's just really quick click OK,\nnotice that there it is, click it,\n\n142\n00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.220\nthere's my macros and\nsome of the other things you can do for\n\n143\n00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.690\nlike creating forms and\nso on and so forth.\n\n144\n00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.500\nComing on back to our options yet again.\n\n145\n00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.910\nWe'll come in to customize the ribbon.\n\n146\n00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.882\nThe other thing you can do is\nyou can make your own tab.\n\n147\n00:07:21.882 --> 00:07:26.540\nLike I could have Vaughn's stuff,\nand then I can put all\n\n148\n00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.880\nthe different commands instead of going\nback and forth between different ribbons.\n\n149\n00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.120\nMake my own and put everything\nthat I need right in one place.\n\n150\n00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.910\nNow, it's very similar to putting\neverything on quick access toolbar.\n\n151\n00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:38.940\nSo, which one you wanna go?\n\n152\n00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.080\nIt's kind of like I like pink.\n\n153\n00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.070\nWell, I like purple.\n\n154\n00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:43.870\nWell, they're both colors, so\nwhichever one you go with.\n\n155\n00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:48.900\nSo, It's one of those options\nto customize your interface.\n\n156\n00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.120\n&gt;&gt; Personal preference.\n\n157\n00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:50.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, totally.\n\n158\n00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.730\n&gt;&gt; Personal preference.\n\n159\n00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and I think this one\nyou can have a lot more stuff.\n\n160\n00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.280\nYou can put them in your own groups.\n\n161\n00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.500\nSo if you're very-\n&gt;&gt; Little more organized.\n\n162\n00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I like organization so\n\n163\n00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:03.500\nthat's something I'd\nprobably be very down with.\n\n164\n00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I mean especially\nwith the quick access toolbar just\n\n165\n00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:06.910\nall the way across.\n\n166\n00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:08.280\nAnd they're just little icons.\n\n167\n00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.130\nWhen you have the commands on the ribbons,\nyou get the name, and it's just a little\n\n168\n00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:16.710\nbit more visual if you wanna say it,\nto yep, that's exactly what I wanna have.\n\n169\n00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:18.280\nSo what do I need to first?\n\n170\n00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.010\nYou need to come down here\nwhere it says new tab.\n\n171\n00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:25.000\nAnd depending on where you're at or what\none is on, it's gonna go, I think, above.\n\n172\n00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:26.920\nWe'll find out.\n\n173\n00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.100\nWe'll click new tab.\n\n174\n00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:28.910\nIt goes below.\n\n175\n00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:29.880\nThat's fine, cuz you know what?\n\n176\n00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.310\nYou can always move it up and down.\n\n177\n00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.280\nTotally good.\n\n178\n00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:36.560\nHere is your new tab and it automatically\ncreates a new group, because if you\n\n179\n00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:42.410\nselected this particular part and then\ntried to add a command from over here,\n\n180\n00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:46.200\nit's gonna tell you, I think it'll give\nme that warning, yep, right there.\n\n181\n00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.660\nYou have to put commands into a group.\n\n182\n00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.150\nYou can't put it on the ribbon by itself.\n\n183\n00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:56.830\nSo that's why you need to make sure that\nyou're here before you add a command.\n\n184\n00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:01.830\nBut with this tab and this group name,\nit just says new tab, new group.\n\n185\n00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:03.720\nThat's not very-\n&gt;&gt; Descriptive.\n\n186\n00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.551\n&gt;&gt; No, not at all.\n\n187\n00:09:04.551 --> 00:09:08.662\n[LAUGH] So when I come to here\nat this level of the tab and\n\n188\n00:09:08.662 --> 00:09:12.594\nwe go to rename and\nlet's name it Vonne's Stuff.\n\n189\n00:09:13.748 --> 00:09:15.476\nOkay.\n\n190\n00:09:16.669 --> 00:09:19.630\nIs that right?\nYeah, [LAUGH] We click OK.\n\n191\n00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:22.940\nThere is my name,\nwhat are we gonna do with our group name?\n\n192\n00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:26.624\nGet to this particular level and\nclick rename, and we will name this and\n\n193\n00:09:26.624 --> 00:09:32.520\nthings [LAUGH] Because we're just\nputting things in here for right now.\n\n194\n00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.578\n&gt;&gt;
