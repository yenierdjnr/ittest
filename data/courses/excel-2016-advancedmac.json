00:00:17.432\nwelcome to Excel 2016 Advanced for Mac.\n\n4\n00:00:17.432 --> 00:00:20.249\nIn this course overview,\nwe're going to be going over, well,\n\n5\n00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:23.380\nexactly what we're gonna cover\nin this particular series.\n\n6\n00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.840\nWho is the target audience, what you might\nneed to know before you get started,\n\n7\n00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.970\nand any extra tidbits that I have for you.\n\n8\n00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.720\nSo we have three main\ntopics within this series.\n\n9\n00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.330\nWe have analyze data, graphical elements,\nand collaborate and security.\n\n10\n00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.040\nIn the analyze data topics we're gonna\ngo over things that a lot of your\n\n11\n00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.380\nExcel users are wanting to know about.\n\n12\n00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.080\nOnce you get past the, okay,\n\n13\n00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.090\nI know how to enter information in to\ncells, now I need to analyze the data.\n\n14\n00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.900\nI need to do things like sort and filter,\nI need to do conditional formating,\n\n15\n00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.240\nwhich is really cool to be able to pull\nthings out of it in a visual format sense.\n\n16\n00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.090\nHow do I make sub totals?\n\n17\n00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.940\nHow do I create outlines?\n\n18\n00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.520\nHow do I group different rows and columns\ninto making it a little bit easier for\n\n19\n00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.480\nme to look at the data and be able to\nmake some determinations from that data?\n\n20\n00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.410\nFormatting as a table,\none of my favorite things.\n\n21\n00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.890\nI use tables all the time in Excel,\n\n22\n00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.740\nI think it's probably one\nof my favorite features.\n\n23\n00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.313\nSo we have some episodes on that.\n\n24\n00:01:25.313 --> 00:01:27.535\nThe What-If Analysis tools,\n\n25\n00:01:27.535 --> 00:01:33.262\nthis is where we're gonna go over\ncreating data tables, creating scenarios,\n\n26\n00:01:33.262 --> 00:01:38.402\nand using the Goal Seek functionality\nwithin that analyzing tool set.\n\n27\n00:01:38.402 --> 00:01:41.731\nWe're gonna consolidate data,\nwe're gonna remove duplicates, and\n\n28\n00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:44.540\nwe're also going to do\nsome advanced filters.\n\n29\n00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.594\nNow, this particular series is not\ngoing to be focused on performing\n\n30\n00:01:49.594 --> 00:01:53.878\ncalculations and\nfunctions within our excel workbooks.\n\n31\n00:01:53.878 --> 00:01:58.475\nYes, we're going to allude to some of it,\nyou're going to see some formulas and\n\n32\n00:01:58.475 --> 00:02:00.504\nfunctions within these files, but\n\n33\n00:02:00.504 --> 00:02:04.580\nwe're not concentrating on how you\nactually create those functions.\n\n34\n00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.000\nThat's in a whole other series.\n\n35\n00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.180\nIt's really more of looking at your\ndata and be able to analyze it.\n\n36\n00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.140\nThen we're gonna move on\nto our graphical elements.\n\n37\n00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.540\nThis is where we get to talk\nabout pictures and shapes.\n\n38\n00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.220\nYou're gonna be like, but this is Excel,\nExcel is more for number crunching,\n\n39\n00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.860\nit's not for creating diagrams.\n\n40\n00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.280\nBut every program has this, and in Excel\nyou do have things like charts and\n\n41\n00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.330\ndiagrams that can really illustrate\nyour points within your information.\n\n42\n00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.450\nNow, charts and graphs are in\nanother whole series as well.\n\n43\n00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.580\nBut the basics that you're going to\nlearn in this particular series,\n\n44\n00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.950\nwith, how do I create a circle, and fill\nit in, and do all the different formats?\n\n45\n00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.140\nThat will apply over into\nhow you can format more\n\n46\n00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.232\nadvanced graphical elements, like charts.\n\n47\n00:02:55.232 --> 00:02:58.437\nBut we will get into\nsome SmartArt as well,\n\n48\n00:02:58.437 --> 00:03:03.425\nreally get your that all of\nyour office products have, and\n\n49\n00:03:03.425 --> 00:03:07.273\nyou could very well have\nthis in an Excel workbook.\n\n50\n00:03:07.273 --> 00:03:10.023\nThe we're gonna move on to collaborate and\nsecurity,\n\n51\n00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:13.080\nwhere we're gonna collaborate and\nlisten with people.\n\n52\n00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.760\nAnd we're going to go\nover shared workbooks,\n\n53\n00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.110\nthe old shared workbooks,\nwe'll tell you about that.\n\n54\n00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.350\nAnd how you can track changes in Excel.\n\n55\n00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.959\nIt's very similar to how you can\ntrack changes in Word, but in Excel,\n\n56\n00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.803\nit has a little bit different flavor\nof how it actually, what it tracks and\n\n57\n00:03:32.803 --> 00:03:37.597\nhow you can look at those and accept and\nreject those different changes.\n\n58\n00:03:37.597 --> 00:03:41.231\nThen we have a little mini\nseries on co-authoring,\n\n59\n00:03:41.231 --> 00:03:45.290\nagain, more of our new ways\nof being able to collaborate.\n\n60\n00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.775\nAnd this is using our cloud services and\nfunctionality of the Office\n\n61\n00:03:50.775 --> 00:03:55.240\n365 applications, where we use our\nOneDrive for business accounts,\n\n62\n00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.940\nof saving files up into that location,\nand being able to coauthor or\n\n63\n00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.050\ncollaborate in real-time with people,\nand how that all works.\n\n64\n00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.040\nWe do have a couple episodes on\ntroubleshooting that because it's a great\n\n65\n00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.240\nfeature, but\nit has a few little gotchas in there.\n\n66\n00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.430\nSo we go over hopefully all\nthe different factors and\n\n67\n00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.470\ndeterminants that will maybe\nmake it not so easy at first.\n\n68\n00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.750\nWe'll also get into data validation,\na great way to control how\n\n69\n00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.250\nother people might be inputting\ninformation into your cells.\n\n70\n00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.850\nSo input masks, it's kind of\ncalled that in other applications,\n\n71\n00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.020\nsuch as Access, but in here were\ngonna call it data validation.\n\n72\n00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.940\nSo good things there.\n\n73\n00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.280\nWe're also gonna get\ninto workbook security.\n\n74\n00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.290\nWe're going to be protecting our\nworksheets, protecting our workbooks.\n\n75\n00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.130\nAlso putting on password protections for\n\n76\n00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.349\neven opening the files or\nediting the files.\n\n77\n00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.820\nThen we end with document properties,\n\n78\n00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:01.540\nunderstanding what that metadata that is\nbehind the scenes in all of your files.\n\n79\n00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.140\nActually, I forgot one thing on our slide.\n\n80\n00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.220\nWe have an additional topic, and\n\n81\n00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.930\nthe one episode that is in there\nis the customized interface.\n\n82\n00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.780\nAnd if ever we need to\nadd more information or\n\n83\n00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.250\nadditional topics, we'll go ahead and\nput them in there.\n\n84\n00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.570\nAnd then we move on to\nour target audience.\n\n85\n00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:19.490\nWho is this for?\n\n86\n00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.440\nAll Office users, capital O,\nmeaning you're using Office 365 suite,\n\n87\n00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.220\nthis is the locally\ninstalled version of Excel.\n\n88\n00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.120\nWe do use Excel online a little\nbit in the collaboration,\n\n89\n00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.020\nbut it is focused on Excel 2016 for Mac.\n\n90\n00:05:36.798 --> 00:05:40.950\nAnd I would call this something\nthat is in Upper basics and\n\n91\n00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.200\nwants to take up their skills\non to the intermediate level.\n\n92\n00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:49.350\nLike, you have a couple base knowledge\nof Excel, like I said, how to\n\n93\n00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.710\nenter some data in there, and now you're\nlooking for how to really work with it.\n\n94\n00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:55.400\nThings you need to know,\n\n95\n00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.180\nyou need to be familiar with\nthe Mac OS environment in the sense of\n\n96\n00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:05.790\nopening files from your finder, knowing\nwhere your doc bar is, those basic things.\n\n97\n00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.644\nI already said, foundational knowledge\nof Excel, you know how to move around,\n\n98\n00:06:09.644 --> 00:06:13.720\nyou know how to switch between open\nworkbooks, you know how to copy and paste.\n\n99\n00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.430\nAnd familiarity with other Office products\nis always helpful in any other Office\n\n100\n00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.221\nproduct cuz if you know a little in one,\nusually you can correlate it to the other.\n\n101\n00:06:23.221 --> 00:06:27.550\nAnd always other options, yes.\n\n102\n00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.887\n[LAUGH] What that means is\nthere's multiple ways to do\n\n103\n00:06:31.887 --> 00:06:35.150\nthe same functionality within Excel.\n\n104\n00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.940\nI tried not to say functions because\nthat's a reserved word in Excel,\n\n105\n00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.460\nbut there's many different ways\nto get to the same end result.\n\n106\n00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.940\nAnd so if I'm doing it one way, there\nmight be another way of doing it, and\n\n107\n00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.920\nthat's totally valid.\n\n108\n00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.840\nUpdates happen, and man, they can mess\nwith you a little bit when it goes ahead\n\n109\n00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.940\nand updates and\nthen your buttons move around, and\n\n110\n00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.480\nthings like the shared workbooks\ndoesn't exist anymore, really?\n\n111\n00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.750\nIt does they just took it away,\nthey took it off the ribbon.\n\n112\n00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:11.260\nIt's not in the actual menus, you have\nto go hunt and pick it, so that happens.\n\n113\n00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.710\nAnd always being able to search for\n\n114\n00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:17.000\nanswers using whatever\nsearch engine that you want.\n\n115\n00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.870\nYou can find it, the Microsoft Help\nfiles are always helpful, but\n\n116\n00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.800\nthere's tons of resources out there\nto help answer your questions.\n\n117\n00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.820\nEverybody uses Excel for\ndifferent reasons, okay?\n\n118\n00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:31.660\nSo I cover all the different\nthings that Excel can do.\n\n119\n00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.711\nSome of it you might not have any use for,\nand\n\n120\n00:07:33.711 --> 00:07:37.055\nthat's totally fine cuz we all use\nit in a little bit different manner.\n\n121\n00:07:37.055 --> 00:07:43.620\nBut for the most part, in this episode and\nin how we learn, have fun.\n\n122\n00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:47.740\nHave fun learning,\nfollow along, and hopefully\n\n123\n00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:52.060\nthe learning will make using Excel more\nfun, and you won't be as frustrated.\n\n124\n00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:56.349\nSo please stick around, and we'll see\nyou in some episodes very shortly.\n\n125\n00:07:56.349 -->
