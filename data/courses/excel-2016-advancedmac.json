00:00:17.432\nwelcome to Excel 2016 Advanced for Mac.\n\n4\n00:00:17.432 --> 00:00:20.249\nIn this course overview,\nwe're going to be going over, well,\n\n5\n00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:23.380\nexactly what we're gonna cover\nin this particular series.\n\n6\n00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.840\nWho is the target audience, what you might\nneed to know before you get started,\n\n7\n00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.970\nand any extra tidbits that I have for you.\n\n8\n00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.720\nSo we have three main\ntopics within this series.\n\n9\n00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.330\nWe have analyze data, graphical elements,\nand collaborate and security.\n\n10\n00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.040\nIn the analyze data topics we're gonna\ngo over things that a lot of your\n\n11\n00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.380\nExcel users are wanting to know about.\n\n12\n00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.080\nOnce you get past the, okay,\n\n13\n00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.090\nI know how to enter information in to\ncells, now I need to analyze the data.\n\n14\n00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.900\nI need to do things like sort and filter,\nI need to do conditional formating,\n\n15\n00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.240\nwhich is really cool to be able to pull\nthings out of it in a visual format sense.\n\n16\n00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.090\nHow do I make sub totals?\n\n17\n00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.940\nHow do I create outlines?\n\n18\n00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.520\nHow do I group different rows and columns\ninto making it a little bit easier for\n\n19\n00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.480\nme to look at the data and be able to\nmake some determinations from that data?\n\n20\n00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.410\nFormatting as a table,\none of my favorite things.\n\n21\n00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.890\nI use tables all the time in Excel,\n\n22\n00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.740\nI think it's probably one\nof my favorite features.\n\n23\n00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.313\nSo we have some episodes on that.\n\n24\n00:01:25.313 --> 00:01:27.535\nThe What-If Analysis tools,\n\n25\n00:01:27.535 --> 00:01:33.262\nthis is where we're gonna go over\ncreating data tables, creating scenarios,\n\n26\n00:01:33.262 --> 00:01:38.402\nand using the Goal Seek functionality\nwithin that analyzing tool set.\n\n27\n00:01:38.402 --> 00:01:41.731\nWe're gonna consolidate data,\nwe're gonna remove duplicates, and\n\n28\n00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:44.540\nwe're also going to do\nsome advanced filters.\n\n29\n00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.594\nNow, this particular series is not\ngoing to be focused on performing\n\n30\n00:01:49.594 --> 00:01:53.878\ncalculations and\nfunctions within our excel workbooks.\n\n31\n00:01:53.878 --> 00:01:58.475\nYes, we're going to allude to some of it,\nyou're going to see some formulas and\n\n32\n00:01:58.475 --> 00:02:00.504\nfunctions within these files, but\n\n33\n00:02:00.504 --> 00:02:04.580\nwe're not concentrating on how you\nactually create those functions.\n\n34\n00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.000\nThat's in a whole other series.\n\n35\n00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.180\nIt's really more of looking at your\ndata and be able to analyze it.\n\n36\n00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.140\nThen we're gonna move on\nto our graphical elements.\n\n37\n00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.540\nThis is where we get to talk\nabout pictures and shapes.\n\n38\n00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.220\nYou're gonna be like, but this is Excel,\nExcel is more for number crunching,\n\n39\n00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.860\nit's not for creating diagrams.\n\n40\n00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.280\nBut every program has this, and in Excel\nyou do have things like charts and\n\n41\n00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.330\ndiagrams that can really illustrate\nyour points within your information.\n\n42\n00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.450\nNow, charts and graphs are in\nanother whole series as well.\n\n43\n00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.580\nBut the basics that you're going to\nlearn in this particular series,\n\n44\n00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.950\nwith, how do I create a circle, and fill\nit in, and do all the different formats?\n\n45\n00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.140\nThat will apply over into\nhow you can format more\n\n46\n00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.232\nadvanced graphical elements, like charts.\n\n47\n00:02:55.232 --> 00:02:58.437\nBut we will get into\nsome SmartArt as well,\n\n48\n00:02:58.437 --> 00:03:03.425\nreally get your that all of\nyour office products have, and\n\n49\n00:03:03.425 --> 00:03:07.273\nyou could very well have\nthis in an Excel workbook.\n\n50\n00:03:07.273 --> 00:03:10.023\nThe we're gonna move on to collaborate and\nsecurity,\n\n51\n00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:13.080\nwhere we're gonna collaborate and\nlisten with people.\n\n52\n00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.760\nAnd we're going to go\nover shared workbooks,\n\n53\n00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.110\nthe old shared workbooks,\nwe'll tell you about that.\n\n54\n00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.350\nAnd how you can track changes in Excel.\n\n55\n00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.959\nIt's very similar to how you can\ntrack changes in Word, but in Excel,\n\n56\n00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.803\nit has a little bit different flavor\nof how it actually, what it tracks and\n\n57\n00:03:32.803 --> 00:03:37.597\nhow you can look at those and accept and\nreject those different changes.\n\n58\n00:03:37.597 --> 00:03:41.231\nThen we have a little mini\nseries on co-authoring,\n\n59\n00:03:41.231 --> 00:03:45.290\nagain, more of our new ways\nof being able to collaborate.\n\n60\n00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.775\nAnd this is using our cloud services and\nfunctionality of the Office\n\n61\n00:03:50.775 --> 00:03:55.240\n365 applications, where we use our\nOneDrive for business accounts,\n\n62\n00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.940\nof saving files up into that location,\nand being able to coauthor or\n\n63\n00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.050\ncollaborate in real-time with people,\nand how that all works.\n\n64\n00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.040\nWe do have a couple episodes on\ntroubleshooting that because it's a great\n\n65\n00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.240\nfeature, but\nit has a few little gotchas in there.\n\n66\n00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.430\nSo we go over hopefully all\nthe different factors and\n\n67\n00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.470\ndeterminants that will maybe\nmake it not so easy at first.\n\n68\n00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.750\nWe'll also get into data validation,\na great way to control how\n\n69\n00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.250\nother people might be inputting\ninformation into your cells.\n\n70\n00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.850\nSo input masks, it's kind of\ncalled that in other applications,\n\n71\n00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.020\nsuch as Access, but in here were\ngonna call it data validation.\n\n72\n00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.940\nSo good things there.\n\n73\n00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.280\nWe're also gonna get\ninto workbook security.\n\n74\n00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.290\nWe're going to be protecting our\nworksheets, protecting our workbooks.\n\n75\n00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.130\nAlso putting on password protections for\n\n76\n00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.349\neven opening the files or\nediting the files.\n\n77\n00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.820\nThen we end with document properties,\n\n78\n00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:01.540\nunderstanding what that metadata that is\nbehind the scenes in all of your files.\n\n79\n00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.140\nActually, I forgot one thing on our slide.\n\n80\n00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.220\nWe have an additional topic, and\n\n81\n00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.930\nthe one episode that is in there\nis the customized interface.\n\n82\n00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.780\nAnd if ever we need to\nadd more information or\n\n83\n00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.250\nadditional topics, we'll go ahead and\nput them in there.\n\n84\n00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.570\nAnd then we move on to\nour target audience.\n\n85\n00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:19.490\nWho is this for?\n\n86\n00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.440\nAll Office users, capital O,\nmeaning you're using Office 365 suite,\n\n87\n00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.220\nthis is the locally\ninstalled version of Excel.\n\n88\n00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.120\nWe do use Excel online a little\nbit in the collaboration,\n\n89\n00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.020\nbut it is focused on Excel 2016 for Mac.\n\n90\n00:05:36.798 --> 00:05:40.950\nAnd I would call this something\nthat is in Upper basics and\n\n91\n00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.200\nwants to take up their skills\non to the intermediate level.\n\n92\n00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:49.350\nLike, you have a couple base knowledge\nof Excel, like I said, how to\n\n93\n00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.710\nenter some data in there, and now you're\nlooking for how to really work with it.\n\n94\n00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:55.400\nThings you need to know,\n\n95\n00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.180\nyou need to be familiar with\nthe Mac OS environment in the sense of\n\n96\n00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:05.790\nopening files from your finder, knowing\nwhere your doc bar is, those basic things.\n\n97\n00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.644\nI already said, foundational knowledge\nof Excel, you know how to move around,\n\n98\n00:06:09.644 --> 00:06:13.720\nyou know how to switch between open\nworkbooks, you know how to copy and paste.\n\n99\n00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.430\nAnd familiarity with other Office products\nis always helpful in any other Office\n\n100\n00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.221\nproduct cuz if you know a little in one,\nusually you can correlate it to the other.\n\n101\n00:06:23.221 --> 00:06:27.550\nAnd always other options, yes.\n\n102\n00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.887\n[LAUGH] What that means is\nthere's multiple ways to do\n\n103\n00:06:31.887 --> 00:06:35.150\nthe same functionality within Excel.\n\n104\n00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.940\nI tried not to say functions because\nthat's a reserved word in Excel,\n\n105\n00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.460\nbut there's many different ways\nto get to the same end result.\n\n106\n00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.940\nAnd so if I'm doing it one way, there\nmight be another way of doing it, and\n\n107\n00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.920\nthat's totally valid.\n\n108\n00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.840\nUpdates happen, and man, they can mess\nwith you a little bit when it goes ahead\n\n109\n00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.940\nand updates and\nthen your buttons move around, and\n\n110\n00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.480\nthings like the shared workbooks\ndoesn't exist anymore, really?\n\n111\n00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.750\nIt does they just took it away,\nthey took it off the ribbon.\n\n112\n00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:11.260\nIt's not in the actual menus, you have\nto go hunt and pick it, so that happens.\n\n113\n00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.710\nAnd always being able to search for\n\n114\n00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:17.000\nanswers using whatever\nsearch engine that you want.\n\n115\n00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.870\nYou can find it, the Microsoft Help\nfiles are always helpful, but\n\n116\n00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.800\nthere's tons of resources out there\nto help answer your questions.\n\n117\n00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.820\nEverybody uses Excel for\ndifferent reasons, okay?\n\n118\n00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:31.660\nSo I cover all the different\nthings that Excel can do.\n\n119\n00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.711\nSome of it you might not have any use for,\nand\n\n120\n00:07:33.711 --> 00:07:37.055\nthat's totally fine cuz we all use\nit in a little bit different manner.\n\n121\n00:07:37.055 --> 00:07:43.620\nBut for the most part, in this episode and\nin how we learn, have fun.\n\n122\n00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:47.740\nHave fun learning,\nfollow along, and hopefully\n\n123\n00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:52.060\nthe learning will make using Excel more\nfun, and you won't be as frustrated.\n\n124\n00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:56.349\nSo please stick around, and we'll see\nyou in some episodes very shortly.\n\n125\n00:07:56.349 -->

tuning in to OfficeProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.406 --> 00:00:17.619\nI'm your show host Wes Bryan and\nin today's episode\n\n5\n00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.604\nwe are continuing along our journey\nthat is the Excel 2016 Advanced for Mac.\n\n6\n00:00:22.604 --> 00:00:25.096\nAnd joining us in the studios is Ms.\nVonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:25.096 --> 00:00:25.763\nVohn, how we doing today?\n\n8\n00:00:25.763 --> 00:00:27.666\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing really great, how are you?\n\n9\n00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:28.786\n&gt;&gt; I am doing great.\n\n10\n00:00:28.786 --> 00:00:32.580\nOne of the things that we're gonna talk\nabout in this episode is probably one of\n\n11\n00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.224\nthe few things that I actually\nknow in Excel, [LAUGH] and\n\n12\n00:00:35.224 --> 00:00:37.831\nwe're gonna be looking at\nconditional formatting.\n\n13\n00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:40.392\nSo Vonne, why don't you help us\nout a little bit on that topic.\n\n14\n00:00:40.392 --> 00:00:43.528\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we were talking right before the\nepisode, he's like I know how to do this.\n\n15\n00:00:43.528 --> 00:00:45.511\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n16\n00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:46.157\n&gt;&gt; If it's this, then do that.\n\n17\n00:00:46.157 --> 00:00:49.391\nI'm like, it's close enough, yeah,\nit's pretty much what it is, yeah.\n\n18\n00:00:49.391 --> 00:00:54.610\nWe are going to be formatting\nbased on a condition.\n\n19\n00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.922\nOkay, so maybe if it is equal\nto department, no, developer or\n\n20\n00:00:59.922 --> 00:01:05.656\nadvertising within the department column,\nmake it pink, right?\n\n21\n00:01:05.656 --> 00:01:09.050\nCuz I'm sure you format all of your\ntexts pink and green and purple, right?\n\n22\n00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.721\n&gt;&gt; I looked for the glitter color,\nbut they didn't have any.\n\n23\n00:01:11.721 --> 00:01:15.277\nOne of the things that I was\ndoing is that, when I worked for\n\n24\n00:01:15.277 --> 00:01:18.850\na company that we were tracking\nthe progress of students.\n\n25\n00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.330\nI don't know what we were tracking,\napparently.\n\n26\n00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.438\nWe were tracking the progress of students,\nand\n\n27\n00:01:23.438 --> 00:01:26.387\nif we hadn't talked to them within a week,\nit would see the date and\n\n28\n00:01:26.387 --> 00:01:29.620\nit would change that cell a certain\ncolor because it's letting us know.\n\n29\n00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.189\nOkay, about a week it's gonna change\nyellow, two weeks it's gonna change\n\n30\n00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.120\norange, and by the time we're\nto three weeks, it turns red.\n\n31\n00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.434\nSo it was a really good functionality.\n\n32\n00:01:37.434 --> 00:01:39.348\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, that's a great example.\n\n33\n00:01:39.348 --> 00:01:43.190\nAnother great example by Wes Bryan,\nI love having you with my episodes.\n\n34\n00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.827\n[LAUGH] So yes, that's exactly\nwhat we're going to be doing.\n\n35\n00:01:45.827 --> 00:01:50.311\nSo why don't we show you how it works,\nand get right to it.\n\n36\n00:01:50.311 --> 00:01:54.870\nI have a workbook actually\ncalled Conditional Formatting.\n\n37\n00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.481\nI do have these filters on here,\n\n38\n00:01:57.481 --> 00:02:02.144\nthat has nothing to do with\nwhat we're going to be using.\n\n39\n00:02:02.144 --> 00:02:06.830\nThe conditional format is no way\nconnected to it, I just turned them on.\n\n40\n00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.206\nAnd so, one thing I actually forgot\nto talk about in the sort and\n\n41\n00:02:10.206 --> 00:02:14.416\nfilter episode is if you don't want\nthose little droppy down things anymore,\n\n42\n00:02:14.416 --> 00:02:16.410\nyou just uncheck the filter, okay?\n\n43\n00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.870\nJust realized I didn't say that.\n\n44\n00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.774\nThat's okay, since you're watching this\nall in progression anyways, you now know.\n\n45\n00:02:21.774 --> 00:02:24.090\nAnd so\nnow I don't have to have those on there.\n\n46\n00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.180\nOkay, cool.\n\n47\n00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.092\nBut the reason why I did have them\non there, let me put them back on,\n\n48\n00:02:29.092 --> 00:02:32.424\nis that in the last episode, yes,\nwe did talk about filtering and sorting.\n\n49\n00:02:32.424 --> 00:02:35.627\nAnd that's one way of\norganizing information,\n\n50\n00:02:35.627 --> 00:02:40.010\nof how we can more easily see things,\njust only give me developer.\n\n51\n00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.856\nBut what if I wanted to,\nlike I said before, let's format it.\n\n52\n00:02:44.856 --> 00:02:48.260\nIf it is equal to developer,\nlet's make it green.\n\n53\n00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.610\nOr if my sales are above $50,\n\n54\n00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.240\nthen highlight the cell in pink,\nor what have you.\n\n55\n00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.840\nSo you can see about all these\ndifferent rules, they are conditions or\n\n56\n00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.780\ncriteria that we must adhere to for\nthe formatting to be applied to.\n\n57\n00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.920\nCool, all right, so let's start over here.\n\n58\n00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.700\nLet's do some of the numbers cuz I think\nit's a little bit easier to start with.\n\n59\n00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.663\nBecause yes, we can use the conditional\nformatting with numbers,\n\n60\n00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:20.293\ndates like Wes was saying, or\nwe could do it with text, okay?\n\n61\n00:03:20.293 --> 00:03:23.514\nBut I think numbers are probably\nan easy way to start.\n\n62\n00:03:23.514 --> 00:03:25.597\nI'm gonna show you the wrong\nway to do it first, okay?\n\n63\n00:03:25.597 --> 00:03:28.190\nSo you’re like hey,\nI wanna go ahead and do the sales.\n\n64\n00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.908\nSo you put your cursor in the Sales\ncolumn because this is something I do\n\n65\n00:03:31.908 --> 00:03:34.250\nevery single time, and I keep forgetting.\n\n66\n00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.846\nSo if I go, let's go ahead and\ndo a conditional formatting,\n\n67\n00:03:37.846 --> 00:03:41.550\nand let's go ahead and\nlook at some of these data bars.\n\n68\n00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.896\nEven before I even tell you what they do,\nI would click and I'm like,\n\n69\n00:03:44.896 --> 00:03:47.157\nwell, that only did one of them,\ndidn't it?\n\n70\n00:03:47.157 --> 00:03:51.890\nYeah, okay, so\nI'm just gonna undo on that one, Cmd+Z.\n\n71\n00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.621\nYou do need to select the range\nthat you want it to look at to\n\n72\n00:03:56.621 --> 00:03:59.290\napply the condition to, okay?\n\n73\n00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.025\nSo that's one of the things that I don't\nalways forget, and I've kinda had to\n\n74\n00:04:04.025 --> 00:04:08.757\ntell myself to, but it does get me every\nonce in a while if I hadn't done this for\n\n75\n00:04:08.757 --> 00:04:12.390\na while, I'm like yeah,\nI gotta select it first.\n\n76\n00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.673\nSo I went ahead and selected that range\nof information that I wanted to look at.\n\n77\n00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:20.510\nAnd now if we just go ahead, let's just do\ndata bars, just to see what it looks like.\n\n78\n00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.230\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and click\nthe gradient fill with light blue, and\n\n79\n00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.074\nlook at that, I love this, it's so cool.\n\n80\n00:04:28.074 --> 00:04:32.648\nLike right now, you get a graphical\nvisual representation of,\n\n81\n00:04:32.648 --> 00:04:38.250\nwell how did this particular cell do in\ncomparison to this based on all of them?\n\n82\n00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.050\nWell it looks like wow,\nthis person, full bar, right?\n\n83\n00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.390\nFull progress bar of like hey, that must\nbe the one that has the highest sale.\n\n84\n00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.220\nSo it's taking all that information,\nlooking at it, evaluating which is\n\n85\n00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:57.195\nthe highest, which is down towards\nthe bottom and then doing the progress.\n\n86\n00:04:57.195 --> 00:04:59.939\nKinda like how much life\ndo you have left in a,\n\n87\n00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:03.924\nwhat was that one game that we always,\nthe dueling, finish him.\n\n88\n00:05:03.924 --> 00:05:05.421\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n89\n00:05:05.421 --> 00:05:08.611\nyou're gonna pull out some Mortal Kombat\nreferences and think I don't know?\n\n90\n00:05:08.611 --> 00:05:10.287\nThat was pathetic.\n\n91\n00:05:10.287 --> 00:05:11.910\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n92\n00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.620\n&gt;&gt; Like the thing with the [SOUND]\n\n93\n00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.624\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n94\n00:05:14.624 --> 00:05:15.437\n&gt;&gt; Wow, okay, yeah.\n\n95\n00:05:15.437 --> 00:05:17.411\nThat's what I grew up playing.\n&gt;&gt; I think she just referenced Scorpion\n\n96\n00:05:17.411 --> 00:05:19.320\nfor those of you that\nare thinking about that.\n\n97\n00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.853\n&gt;&gt; Yes, he was yellow, right?\n\n98\n00:05:19.853 --> 00:05:21.030\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, he was.\n\n99\n00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.873\n&gt;&gt; And Sub-Zero was blue.\n\n100\n00:05:21.873 --> 00:05:23.271\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n101\n00:05:23.271 --> 00:05:25.196\nGet over here, and freezing him.\n\n102\n00:05:25.196 --> 00:05:26.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just saying.\n\n103\n00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.450\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, so yeah,\nhow much life you have left.\n\n104\n00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.235\nAnd we're not actually talking about life,\nwe're talking about values.\n\n105\n00:05:31.235 --> 00:05:36.380\nBut anyways, it's what I remember and\nwhat it's representing to me.\n\n106\n00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.145\nThat's pretty cool., and\nyou can see, oops, sorry,\n\n107\n00:05:39.145 --> 00:05:41.979\nwent ahead and tried to move that,\nand that's it, neat.\n\n108\n00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:46.029\nOkay, so if I wanted to,\nthat's with numbers, right?\n\n109\n00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:50.810\nNow, this is not gonna make any sense,\nbecause these are zip codes, okay?\n\n110\n00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.830\nZip codes you don't really\nevaluate on its number basis.\n\n111\n00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:00.020\nBut I'm just trying to show you that if I\nwent ahead and did the color scales, okay?\n\n112\n00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.986\nSo data bars is going to go ahead and\ngive you a progress bar, and\n\n113\n00:06:04.986 --> 00:06:10.820\nthen the colors is just gonna show you\nin varying shades from green to red.\n\n114\n00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.813\nSo that one, see that's a very dark\ngreen cuz that's the highest number,\n\n115\n00:06:15.813 --> 00:06:18.996\nversus this one which is red, that's 0, 7.\n\n116\n00:06:18.996 --> 00:06:20.744\nSo that's gonna be the lowest numbers.\n\n117\n00:06:20.744 --> 00:06:23.606\nAgain, doesn't make any\nsense on zip codes, but\n\n118\n00:06:23.606 --> 00:06:27.850\nyou get the idea of how you might want\nto go ahead and look at those numbers.\n\n119\n00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:32.169\nAnd also notice that I have two different\ntypes of conditional formatting on\n\n120\n00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:33.730\ndifferent sets of ranges.\n\n121\n00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:34.800\nOkay, so cool.\n\n122\n00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.380\nSo you could do this throughout\nall of your different columns.\n\n123\n00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:43.170\nI could go ahead and\nselect these two columns, okay?\n\n124\n00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.970\nAnd then do conditional formatting there.\n\n125\n00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.720\nNow in this one, notice that it's not\ngonna do anything with the data bars,\n\n126\n00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.300\nit's gonna say, well,\nit's not numbers, okay?\n\n127\n00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:58.374\nSo these sets if you wanna say, like these\nright in here are gonna be reserved for\n\n128\n00:06:58.374 --> 00:07:01.658\nnumbers, it's looking at\nit in numerical value.\n\n129\n00:07:01.658 --> 00:07:06.287\nBut then up here,\nthis is where the highlight cells rule,\n\n130\n00:07:06.287 --> 00:07:11.870\nthis could be stuff for like the equal\nto or text that contains, okay?\n\n131\n00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:17.212\nSo just know that you can't always put\nthe conditional formatings on anything.\n\n132\n00:07:17.212 --> 00:07:22.779\nYou do have to look at,\nis it a number or is it text, okay?\n\n133\n00:07:22.779 --> 00:07:24.549\nSo just coming back around to that,\n\n134\n00:07:24.549 --> 00:07:27.204\none more thing that I want to\ndo on some of the numbers,\n\n135\n00:07:27.204 --> 00:07:30.990\nwe'll come back to the text in a minute,\nis let's go ahead and select this.\n\n136\n00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:35.423\nBecause, yes, we did the data bars,\nwe did the color scales,\n\n137\n00:07:35.423 --> 00:07:39.450\nlet's see the icon sets,\njust to see what it looks like.\n\n138\n00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:42.290\nWe have up, middle, down.\n\n139\n00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:44.390\nWe have like a little moons.\n\n140\n00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.920\nWe have our little bars, right?\n\n141\n00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.750\nFor like our Wi-Fi signal and\neverything like that, our ratings.\n\n142\n00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.720\nSo it's just whatever\nicon set that you want.\n\n143\n00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.654\nLet's go ahead and do,\nlet's do that first one.\n\n144\n00:07:56.654 --> 00:07:59.554\nAnd so you can see that,\nbut even cooler, look,\n\n145\n00:07:59.554 --> 00:08:02.082\nI just did two different\ntypes of formatting.\n\n146\n00:08:02.082 --> 00:08:05.750\nI have the progress bars and the arrows.\n\n147\n00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.953\nSo you could sit here and\njust put as many on them as you want, but\n\n148\n00:08:08.953 --> 00:08:13.140\nthen this is where I might be like, like\nthis is getting a little too much, right?\n\n149\n00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:17.620\nI don't need the icons and the progress\nbars, I really wanna go ahead and\n\n150\n00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:20.050\njust kind of clear that.\n\n151\n00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.550\nSo I don't have anything selected.\n\n152\n00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:27.600\nNotice, you can clear it from the entire\nsheet, which is what I wanna do.\n\n153\n00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:31.260\nOr if you have that column selected,\nyou can then go ahead and\n\n154\n00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.210\nclear out just the sales and\nkeep the formatting for\n\n155\n00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:37.500\nthe zip codes, so\nyou just have to kinda pick your poison.\n\n156\n00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.860\nDo you want all of it, do you want\njust the ones that you selected?\n\n157\n00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:44.038\nI'm gonna go with the entire sheet to just\nkinda give us a blank slate from there.\n\n158\n00:08:44.038 --> 00:08:48.620\nBecause I do like the icon sets,\nI think they're kinda fun.\n\n159\n00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:52.057\nDifferent ways that I can look at\nthings maybe, like little half moons.\n\n160\n00:08:52.057 --> 00:08:57.783\nBut again to me I don't feel like this\nconveys as much as like the color bars or\n\n161\n00:08:57.783 --> 00:09:04.242\nthe, I keep calling them progress bars but\nthey are data bars in color scales, okay?\n\n162\n00:09:04.242 --> 00:09:07.124\n&gt;&gt; And one of the things I would ask,\ntoo, on that Vonne,\n\n163\n00:09:07.124 --> 00:09:11.389\nis it seems like when you're selecting\nthese certain values here you're kind of\n\n164\n00:09:11.389 --> 00:09:15.297\nhave the mercy of what Excel says,\nyeah, this is how I think it should be.\n\n165\n00:09:15.297 --> 00:09:17.337\nWhat if you need to customize\nit a little bit more?\n\n166\n00:09:17.337 --> 00:09:20.589\nWhat if you wanna say hey I don't\nwanna wait for Excel to figure it out.\n\n167\n00:09:20.589 --> 00:09:22.368\nI kinda already know what I'm on and\n\n168\n00:09:22.368 --> 00:09:25.440\nI wanna make sure that it\nrepresents the data that way?\n\n169\n00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.250\n&gt;&gt; Great question because yeah\nit is doing it on its own\n\n170\n00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:31.020\nlike where it chooses to break its colors.\n\n171\n00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:34.050\nLet's go ahead and\nselect the range of cells again and\n\n172\n00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:35.960\ncome back up in conditional formatting.\n\n173\n00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.970\nBecause then you could go ahead and,\neach one of them, whether it's data bars,\n\n174\n00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:45.220\ncolor scales, icon sets, each one of\nthem down at the bottom has more rules.\n\n175\n00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:48.800\nSo that way you can go to, and\nit's really the same as going to new rule.\n\n176\n00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.610\nIt's just taking you specifically to, hey,\n\n177\n00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:54.890\nyou wanna format data bars,\nthat's where I'll take you.\n\n178\n00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:57.630\nYou wanna format icon sets,\nthat's where I'm gonna take you.\n\n179\n00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:01.040\nLet's gonna go with icon sets right now\nsince that's the last one I clicked on.\n\n180\n00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.450\nBecause you were saying where\nit's breaking, it's right here.\n\n181\n00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:10.080\nSo see it's saying, I'm gonna display\na green when it is greater than or\n\n182\n00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.220\nequal to 67% of that value.\n\n183\n00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:17.230\nSo maybe one that's a break at 75, or you\nwant a different place of where it's going\n\n184\n00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:22.600\nto break the green and\nthe yellow and the, wait, yeah, red.\n\n185\n00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.805\n[LAUGH] I'm looking, what color is that?\n\n186\n00:10:25.805 --> 00:10:26.870\n[LAUGH] I don't know.\n\n187\n00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:29.160\nAnd you can see that is it the percent?\n\n188\n00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.170\nIs it a number?\n\n189\n00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:36.500\nSo you have ways that you can customize\neach one of these types of rules.\n\n190\n00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.210\nAnd notice up here, we're on icon sets.\n\n191\n00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:41.670\nBut if I wanted to change like,\nthe two color scale,\n\n192\n00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.980\nbecause I really want it pink and\npurple, right?\n\n193\n00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.387\nSo I could go ahead and make it pink.\n\n194\n00:10:46.387 --> 00:10:50.069\nOne other thing, right now,\nthose data sets, sorry, the color bars.\n\n195\n00:10:50.069 --> 00:10:55.181\nAnd the other thing, the color schemes or\nwhatever, they're not based on the theme\n\n196\n00:10:55.181 --> 00:10:59.722\ncolors, so if you change your themes,\nit's like hard coded as the color.\n\n197\n00:10:59.722 --> 00:11:03.758\nBut if you came in here and\nformatted them to your theme colors,\n\n198\n00:11:03.758 --> 00:11:07.045\nthen if you change a theme,\nit will change with it.\n\n199\n00:11:07.045 --> 00:11:12.930\nSo it's kind of a hard code color\nversus base it off a theme color.\n\n200\n00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:17.320\nSo if I wanted to go into my pinks,\nand we'll say pink for\n\n201\n00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.540\nthe lowest and\nthen purple for the highest.\n\n202\n00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:20.888\nThat doesn't really give\nyou much of a variation.\n\n203\n00:11:20.888 --> 00:11:24.763\nBut you can see that,\nsame things that we did with the.\n\n204\n00:11:24.763 --> 00:11:28.518\nYou can customize them to\nbe whichever way you want.\n\n205\n00:11:28.518 --> 00:11:33.376\nAnd 3-Color Scale, I like these colors,\nwe'll keep them there.\n\n206\n00:11:33.376 --> 00:11:38.327\n[LAUGH] We click OK, and then notice,\nnow you're getting into all these\n\n207\n00:11:38.327 --> 00:11:43.195\nvarying shades that might get a little\ntoo much so you're gonna have to\n\n208\n00:11:43.195 --> 00:11:48.770\npick the type of conditional formats\nthat makes most sense to you.\n\n209\n00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:50.940\nAnd let's go ahead and clear that.\n\n210\n00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.300\nMaybe I don't like all\nthese variating colors.\n\n211\n00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.780\nIt's just a little too much.\n\n212\n00:11:55.780 --> 00:12:00.480\nYou can then go ahead and\nchoose from here.\n\n213\n00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.390\nJust highlight the cells.\n\n214\n00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:07.070\nIf I wanted to say greater\nthan a particular number.\n\n215\n00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:14.120\nSo I say greater than 150, and\nI want you to format it with,\n\n216\n00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:18.640\nthey have some pre-made ones, with light\nred, yellow, green, or you know what?\n\n217\n00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.640\nLet's just go to custom formats.\n\n218\n00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.590\nAnd then I can just choose to\nmake it bold if I wanted to.\n\n219\n00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:29.360\nSo you can come in, and do all sorts of\ndifferent things, sorry font, there it is.\n\n220\n00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.520\nI was looking It's right there,\nI was already on it [LAUGH].\n\n221\n00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.577\nMaybe I want it purple and bold,\nthat's what I want, you click OK.\n\n222\n00:12:35.577 --> 00:12:36.779\nAnd then there you go,\n\n223\n00:12:36.779 --> 00:12:40.776\nanything above 150, wow it looks\nlike most people are above 150.\n\n224\n00:12:40.776 --> 00:12:45.891\nSo that's where you can choose\nhowever you want to highlight or\n\n225\n00:12:45.891 --> 00:12:49.050\nchange the colors all based on it.\n\n226\n00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:53.790\nChange, choose your range, and then choose\nyour formatting, choose a condition.\n\n227\n00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:56.480\nThat's it, pretty much.\nBut there's more that it'll do, so.\n\n228\n00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.105\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Vonne, one of the things\nthat we've been looking at so far,\n\n229\n00:12:59.105 --> 00:13:00.910\nis how can we\n&gt;&gt; Evaluate numbers, right,\n\n230\n00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:04.807\nand we've seen that when it's a monetary\nvalues sometimes Excel is pretty smart,\n\n231\n00:13:04.807 --> 00:13:06.325\nright, and it gets it, right?\n\n232\n00:13:06.325 --> 00:13:09.510\n[LAUGH] However we've also seen\nthat the numerical codes or\n\n233\n00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:12.950\nvalues with a zip code doesn't\nquite act the way you want.\n\n234\n00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:14.300\nWhat can we expect with text?\n\n235\n00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:17.540\nIs this something that we can see with\ntext where maybe we should expect\n\n236\n00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:18.410\nthe unexpected?\n\n237\n00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:21.530\nOr maybe you're here to let us to\nknow exactly what we can expect.\n\n238\n00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:22.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's pretty straightforward.\n\n239\n00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.000\nIt's the same way that\nhey I wanna go ahead.\n\n240\n00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.380\nNow we already saw on that one example\nwhere I tried to do the color bars or\n\n241\n00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:30.100\nthe data bars.\n\n242\n00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:31.235\nIt didn't work.\n\n243\n00:13:31.235 --> 00:13:34.990\nBecause it needs that to be numbers,\nand it's not text.\n\n244\n00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:39.290\nBut there are rules that we can do, so\nwhy don't we show you what we can do?\n\n245\n00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:41.430\nLet's come over here, and\n\n246\n00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:46.620\nI'm gonna grab these two columns, cuz\nthat's what we were talking about before.\n\n247\n00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:50.860\nSo none of these are gonna really work\ncuz it's not that type of information for\n\n248\n00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:54.900\nit to evaluate, but I can highlight it.\n\n249\n00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:59.396\nI can highlight that it is\nequal to a specific word.\n\n250\n00:13:59.396 --> 00:14:04.148\nOr maybe text that contains,\nmaybe I need it to contain the word\n\n251\n00:14:04.148 --> 00:14:08.014\nstreet somewhere in there for\nany of those things.\n\n252\n00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:12.648\nSo that's what, and you talked about the\ndates, memory that's something you can do.\n\n253\n00:14:12.648 --> 00:14:16.687\nI don't have a spreadsheet that has\nanything with dates right now, but\n\n254\n00:14:16.687 --> 00:14:17.707\nyou get the idea.\n\n255\n00:14:17.707 --> 00:14:21.825\nSelect, choose your criteria and\nthe format it if you want to adhere to.\n\n256\n00:14:21.825 --> 00:14:26.151\nSo if I go text that contains,\nand let's go with, do I want a,\n\n257\n00:14:26.151 --> 00:14:31.061\nthis is another one, blanks,\nnot blank, that's kind of cool,\n\n258\n00:14:31.061 --> 00:14:36.540\ndo I want the cell value specific text,\nall of those kind of cool things.\n\n259\n00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.680\nDo I want to contain,\ndo I want to begin with, so\n\n260\n00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.570\nyeah it went ahead and\nstarted with those drop downs,\n\n261\n00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:45.550\nbut once you get into here, you can\ncustomize it however you want it to be.\n\n262\n00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:49.552\nBut I will say Specific Text containing,\nlet's just do ST.\n\n263\n00:14:49.552 --> 00:14:53.370\nCuz that's what I want,\nand we'll go with green.\n\n264\n00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:55.110\nWe'll just choose the one\nthat they already have.\n\n265\n00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:56.990\nI don't necessarily need to\ngo into those custom formats.\n\n266\n00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:58.390\nYou saw me do that in the other one.\n\n267\n00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:03.280\nWe click OK and there goes,\nspace there is Java Street,\n\n268\n00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.950\nmain street but that's SL but\nit still has ST doesn't it?\n\n269\n00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:12.900\nAha, same with like Stewart, okay,\nthat it contains an S Boston,\n\n270\n00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:17.710\nokay, you get the idea cuz this is exactly\nwhat I told it to be the criteria It has\n\n271\n00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:22.750\nto have those letters,\nit contains S and T together, okay?\n\n272\n00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:26.930\nSo different things you can do for\nyour text.\n\n273\n00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:30.770\nYou could also, if you wanted to,\nyou could change the, hey,\n\n274\n00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:32.760\ndo you want me to highlight?\n\n275\n00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:35.840\nMeaning, change the formatting,\nduplicate values.\n\n276\n00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.150\nFor right here I will go ahead and\nsort this just so\n\n277\n00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:41.380\nwe can see it a little bit better.\n\n278\n00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:44.590\nNotice there's cat, cat,\ncat and there's paws.\n\n279\n00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:50.940\nSo I do see that, in this particular\ncolumn, there are duplicate values.\n\n280\n00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:55.100\nSo if I go ahead and select this,\ncome over here to conditional formatting.\n\n281\n00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:59.465\nWe can do Highlight Cell Rules\nwith Duplicate Values.\n\n282\n00:15:59.465 --> 00:16:00.382\nClick on that.\n\n283\n00:16:00.382 --> 00:16:02.994\nAnd we'll just choose Red, that's fine.\n\n284\n00:16:02.994 --> 00:16:03.749\nThere you go.\n\n285\n00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:08.879\nSo now it's showing me duplicate values,\nbut do notice that this is\n\n286\n00:16:08.879 --> 00:16:14.810\nonly doing it within that selected range,\nand that's all it's doing.\n\n287\n00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:20.025\nIt's not treating this\nas its entire record.\n\n288\n00:16:20.025 --> 00:16:23.635\nSo there's other ways that we\ncan use remove duplicates.\n\n289\n00:16:23.635 --> 00:16:28.102\nSo that's in other episodes,\nbut it is reduced down to,\n\n290\n00:16:28.102 --> 00:16:31.739\nif you wanna say,\nthe place where you select.\n\n291\n00:16:31.739 --> 00:16:34.189\nThis is not treating this as an entire,\n\n292\n00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:37.318\ncontiguous row of information\nthat then it does.\n\n293\n00:16:37.318 --> 00:16:38.740\nSo it's very specific.\n\n294\n00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:41.471\nIt does exactly what you tell it to do,\nbut\n\n295\n00:16:41.471 --> 00:16:45.774\njust realize that that's what it does,\nand that's all it does.\n\n296\n00:16:45.774 --> 00:16:48.660\nI always get to the point where\npeople are like, well yeah,\n\n297\n00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.025\nnow I want to go ahead and\ntake that whole row, and\n\n298\n00:16:51.025 --> 00:16:54.008\nthen highlight that whole row\nbased on the duplicate value.\n\n299\n00:16:54.008 --> 00:16:57.713\nI'm like [SOUND] it doesn't\nreally go that way.\n\n300\n00:16:57.713 --> 00:17:02.654\nIt's just formatting based on a criteria,\nthat's basically all it does.\n\n301\n00:17:02.654 --> 00:17:06.318\n&gt;&gt; Now Yvonne, one of the things I've see\nis that you did show us how to adjust\n\n302\n00:17:06.318 --> 00:17:09.393\nthe rules, but what happens if,\nmaybe I've got a color, and\n\n303\n00:17:09.393 --> 00:17:12.706\nI decide maybe I don't want purple\nanymore, and I wanna go back and\n\n304\n00:17:12.706 --> 00:17:15.045\nI wanna do a little\nmodification of the rules.\n\n305\n00:17:15.045 --> 00:17:16.598\nCan we manage the rules too?\n\n306\n00:17:16.598 --> 00:17:19.335\n&gt;&gt; So a modification of the rule\nis already applied, right?\n\n307\n00:17:19.335 --> 00:17:19.889\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n308\n00:17:19.889 --> 00:17:20.673\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n309\n00:17:20.673 --> 00:17:21.887\nWe can totally do that.\n\n310\n00:17:21.887 --> 00:17:25.430\nSo, why don't we come back and\nshow you that like, like you were saying,\n\n311\n00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:28.806\nI've already got some rules applied\nto this particular worksheet and\n\n312\n00:17:28.806 --> 00:17:30.141\nI don't want that purple.\n\n313\n00:17:30.141 --> 00:17:30.935\nThat's what you're asking about right?\n\n314\n00:17:30.935 --> 00:17:31.550\n&gt;&gt; Yep, definitely.\n\n315\n00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:34.088\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, so I wanna change this.\n\n316\n00:17:34.088 --> 00:17:37.830\nNow, I could clear it and\nredo it, but it's already applied.\n\n317\n00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:41.177\nSo you can manage your rules.\n\n318\n00:17:41.177 --> 00:17:42.680\nSo I've got a couple on here.\n\n319\n00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.500\nWe've got the red, we've got the green,\nwe've got the purple.\n\n320\n00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:48.410\nSo if I come over here,\nwhoops well let's go ahead and\n\n321\n00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:50.390\nclick into the cell first of all.\n\n322\n00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:53.111\nActually, you know what, I think I\nwill select it here, there we go.\n\n323\n00:17:53.111 --> 00:17:55.370\nNow we go ahead and\nmanage the rules, see there we go.\n\n324\n00:17:55.370 --> 00:18:00.270\nNow I had to make a selection\nwhere it was pulling\n\n325\n00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:02.570\nall the rules that I had on my sheet.\n\n326\n00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:04.020\nSo let's back up.\n\n327\n00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.831\nTo make sure that I got that right,\nokay, we can probably go ahead and\n\n328\n00:18:07.831 --> 00:18:11.578\nselect the whole worksheet,\ncuz then when I go ahead and manage it,\n\n329\n00:18:11.578 --> 00:18:15.298\nit's gonna pull all the rules that\nare applied in that worksheet.\n\n330\n00:18:15.298 --> 00:18:19.501\nSo that might be something you'd wanna do,\nbecause just you saw me do it.\n\n331\n00:18:19.501 --> 00:18:21.310\nI was like, wait,\nI know there's other rules in here.\n\n332\n00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:23.665\nWhy isn't, I need to select it.\n\n333\n00:18:23.665 --> 00:18:25.387\n[NOISE] Okay, that sounds good.\n\n334\n00:18:25.387 --> 00:18:28.843\nSo you're gonna see that I've\ngot a rule for duplicate values,\n\n335\n00:18:28.843 --> 00:18:33.580\ncells that contain street, or ST, and then\nI have cell value that is greater than 50.\n\n336\n00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:37.570\nOkay, I don't want it to be purple, or\nI don't want this to be red anymore.\n\n337\n00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:42.544\nSo if you click on it, notice that if\nI can come down here to edit the rule,\n\n338\n00:18:42.544 --> 00:18:46.946\nso I select the rule that I want it to,\nand then I go to edit, and so\n\n339\n00:18:46.946 --> 00:18:51.950\nnow I can come back in here, and\nwe will change this to a different color.\n\n340\n00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:53.518\nWhat color do you want there, Wes?\n\n341\n00:18:53.518 --> 00:18:55.090\n&gt;&gt; Green.\nThat's my other favorite.\n\n342\n00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:58.720\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's go with green, and\nyou know what, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n343\n00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.895\nmake it a super bright,\nwell that's not, it's kind of sea foam,\n\n344\n00:19:01.895 --> 00:19:05.095\nbut guess what, you got the first part,\nI'll take the rest of it.\n\n345\n00:19:05.095 --> 00:19:06.028\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's okay.\n\n346\n00:19:06.028 --> 00:19:06.670\nI like the water.\n\n347\n00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:10.798\n&gt;&gt; So we click OK, or\nactually we got to click OK here first,\n\n348\n00:19:10.798 --> 00:19:13.206\nsorry, and then we click OK, and\n\n349\n00:19:13.206 --> 00:19:18.714\nnow you can see that everything that\nwas purple is now seafoam green, okay?\n\n350\n00:19:18.714 --> 00:19:21.738\nSo yes, you can go back and\nmanage your rules after the fact\n\n351\n00:19:21.738 --> 00:19:25.897\nif you wanted to change them, and you\ndon't have to go through the whole thing.\n\n352\n00:19:25.897 --> 00:19:28.720\nSo I showed you the couple different ways,\nbut it is a little bit nicer.\n\n353\n00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:32.655\nJust remember to select the whole\nworksheet, cuz it makes it a lot easier,\n\n354\n00:19:32.655 --> 00:19:37.277\notherwise you think that it's not managing\nanything, because if I'm right here, and\n\n355\n00:19:37.277 --> 00:19:41.710\nI go into Manage Rules, it's gonna show me\nnothing, cuz I don't have any cells that\n\n356\n00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:45.236\nactually have conditional formatting\nselected for me to manage.\n\n357\n00:19:45.236 --> 00:19:46.710\nSo, there we go.\n\n358\n00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:51.230\nSo you can see that conditional formatting\nis pretty straightforward once you\n\n359\n00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:55.200\nget the idea, make your selection,\ngo ahead and set your criteria,\n\n360\n00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.897\nset your formatting, and\nthen move on with your merry life, and\n\n361\n00:19:58.897 --> 00:20:01.840\nit is like you said,\na very easy way to quickly see,\n\n362\n00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:06.564\nhey I haven't taught that person, or hey,\nthe duplicates or whatever you want,\n\n363\n00:20:06.564 --> 00:20:09.673\nthat's what conditional\nformatting can do for you.\n\n364\n00:20:09.673 --> 00:20:11.495\n&gt;&gt; Conditional formatting,\nall apart of Excel.\n\n365\n00:20:11.495 --> 00:20:14.257\nThat's right,\nthe Excel 2016 Advanced for Macs.\n\n366\n00:20:14.257 --> 00:20:17.265\nSo Vonne, we do appreciate having\nyou here in the studios with us,\n\n367\n00:20:17.265 --> 00:20:20.166\nbut it does look like we are coming\nto the end of another episode,\n\n368\n00:20:20.166 --> 00:20:22.178\nbecause we don't have anymore times left.\n\n369\n00:20:22.178 --> 00:20:22.800\n[LAUGH] More times?\n\n370\n00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.886\nHow about any more minutes\nleft on that clock.\n\n371\n00:20:24.886 --> 00:20:28.078\nSigning out for Office Pro TV,\nremember I've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n372\n00:20:28.078 --> 00:20:28.866\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n373\n00:20:28.866 --> 00:20:31.243\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n374\n00:20:31.243 --> 00:20:35.633\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:14.961 --> 00:00:16.801\nI'm your show host, Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:20.870\nAnd in today's episode we're actually\ncontinuing through our series in Excel.\n\n5\n00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.700\nThat's right,\nit's the Excel 2016 advance for Mac.\n\n6\n00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.860\nAnd joining us back in\nthe studio is Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.060\nVonn, how are we doing today?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, how are you?\n\n8\n00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.260\n&gt;&gt; I am doing great,\n\n9\n00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.640\nlooking forward to some of the content\nthat we have in store for us today.\n\n10\n00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.030\nAnd if my show notes are right,\n\n11\n00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.560\nwe're gonna be looking at something\nknown as outlines and subtotals.\n\n12\n00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.440\nBut we're gonna have to let Vonne\ntell you what that's about.\n\n13\n00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.940\n&gt;&gt; Well you know what, you are correct.\n\n14\n00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.760\nWe are doing outlines and subtotals.\n\n15\n00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.160\nIt's funny cuz I'm like, he doesn't\nremember what the episode's about,\n\n16\n00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.418\nI wonder if he's gonna throw it back to\nme, or is he gonna look at the notes?\n\n17\n00:00:48.418 --> 00:00:49.013\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n18\n00:00:49.013 --> 00:00:51.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Which way is Wes gonna go?\n\n19\n00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.630\nSo good job.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n20\n00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:53.637\n&gt;&gt; So it's like you've done this once or\n\n21\n00:00:53.637 --> 00:00:55.480\ntwice?\n&gt;&gt; Once or twice.\n\n22\n00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right,\n\n23\n00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.310\nso yeah, we are gonna be doing\noutlining and subtotals.\n\n24\n00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.530\nWhat is an outline?\n\n25\n00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.790\nThink back to when you're writing a paper,\nin school.\n\n26\n00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.150\nYou had to turn in the outline first,\nright?\n\n27\n00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.640\nIt's just your top level bullet points\nof what you're going to be doing.\n\n28\n00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.350\nRight?\n\n29\n00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.400\nWell, that's pretty much what\nyou're going to be doing in Excel.\n\n30\n00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.750\nYou're going to be outlining and creating\ncollapsible and expandable groups.\n\n31\n00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.430\nSo, outlining is going to\nbe under the Data tab and\n\n32\n00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.990\nit's going to actually be in\nthe command called Group.\n\n33\n00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.700\nSo just in case you're like I don't see\nthe outline button, yeah, it's grouping.\n\n34\n00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.230\nBut that's what we're going to do.\n\n35\n00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.860\nSubtotals is probably one of\nmy favorite things in Excel.\n\n36\n00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.470\nI love them and hopefully I will\npass on that love to you so\n\n37\n00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.980\nyou can think they're pretty cool, too.\n\n38\n00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.370\nSo, well let's get started.\n\n39\n00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.800\nI have a file called Outline and\nSubtotals.\n\n40\n00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.920\nI wonder where I get these names from.\n\n41\n00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.480\nAll right, so\nI've got some information here.\n\n42\n00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.350\nNow we're going to be\ndoing a manual outline.\n\n43\n00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.780\nSo right here I've got some information.\n\n44\n00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.270\nWe've got the Graphics department, and\nI have the Web and Sales Departments.\n\n45\n00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.830\nSo now each one of them we've got the same\ntype of information, first, last.\n\n46\n00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.710\nNotice we have a couple groups in here.\n\n47\n00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.820\nWe have the Social Media people,\nand then we have the Design people.\n\n48\n00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.820\nAnd then we also have within the Web and\nSales, we have Developers, and\n\n49\n00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:22.930\nwe have Sales.\n\n50\n00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.770\nNow, when I'm looking at all of this,\nthis is fine.\n\n51\n00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.030\nI don't have that many rows going on.\n\n52\n00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.842\nBut, if you have this times 1,000,\n\n53\n00:02:31.842 --> 00:02:37.090\nyou might not want to really see\nthe graphics people right now.\n\n54\n00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.390\nAnd I really just wanna see the web and\nsales.\n\n55\n00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.350\nIt's a way that you can, it's not hiding,\nit's not like we're actually cutting into\n\n56\n00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.470\nhere, and hiding our rows,\nbut we're gonna group them.\n\n57\n00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.030\nSo then we can collapse it down to\nwhere we don't really need to see them.\n\n58\n00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.160\nSo it's kind of like my favorite saying,\nit's kind of the same but\n\n59\n00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.040\ntotally different.\n\n60\n00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.090\nSo, let's go ahead and\nshow you how to do it.\n\n61\n00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.680\nYou're going to need to first\nof all go to your Data tab.\n\n62\n00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.620\nAnd that's right over here,\nsee it doesn't say outline.\n\n63\n00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.628\nIt says Group,\nthat's the wrong button [LAUGH] and\n\n64\n00:03:12.628 --> 00:03:15.720\nthen if you drop this\ndown notice it has Group.\n\n65\n00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.680\nAnd then at the bottom\nwe have auto outline,\n\n66\n00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.060\nI'll show you that in another example.\n\n67\n00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.800\nSo the first thing you're gonna need\nto do is what do I want to group by?\n\n68\n00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.430\nI want all of this,\nthe graphics to be one group.\n\n69\n00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.050\nSo I'm going to select\nrows four through 15.\n\n70\n00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.520\nAll I did is was just click, hold and\n\n71\n00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.670\ndrag down the black arrow pointing\nto the right to select my rows.\n\n72\n00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.880\nThis needs to become one group.\n\n73\n00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.250\nSelect, go to group and you click Group.\n\n74\n00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.690\nNotice over here some\nthings that are happening.\n\n75\n00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.900\nThey're tiny but it becomes almost\nlike a whole separate area within\n\n76\n00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.350\nyour environment, and it has these tiny\nlittle buttons up here for ones and twos.\n\n77\n00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:04.080\nSo this is just like your levels of your\noutline or when you make a bulleted list.\n\n78\n00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.100\nWhen you have sub-bullets or\nnested lists inside of them.\n\n79\n00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.560\nThat's what we've got going on here.\n\n80\n00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.220\nAnd what I've done is I've\nmade a collapsible section.\n\n81\n00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.127\nNotice that if I click that little minus\nbutton right here, it collapses it down,\n\n82\n00:04:20.127 --> 00:04:23.060\nclick that little plus\nit expands back out.\n\n83\n00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.400\nThat's pretty cool.\n\n84\n00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.950\nSo it's grouping your rows into\ncollapsible and expandable sections.\n\n85\n00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.260\nThe ones and the twos are just other\nways that we can click on the one,\n\n86\n00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.330\nand do you see how it's\nshowing my first level.\n\n87\n00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.024\nClick on the two,\nit's gonna show me my second level.\n\n88\n00:04:43.024 --> 00:04:44.240\nPretty neat.\n\n89\n00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.690\nOkay, let's keep on doing it.\n\n90\n00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.320\nLet's go ahead and make the Web and\nSales, we'll make that their own group.\n\n91\n00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:55.850\nI'm choosing the header, or the subheader,\nif you want to call it, row.\n\n92\n00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.750\nYou can totally select the Web and\nSales and go down through here,\n\n93\n00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.420\nit just depends on how you want\nit to look in the different\n\n94\n00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.980\nlevels of where they expand and collapse.\n\n95\n00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.210\nSo I'm gonna keep like the main heading,\nand\n\n96\n00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.540\nthen make the next part,\nthe subheadings, the next group.\n\n97\n00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.170\nSo if I go ahead and select that,\nyou go ahead and click Group.\n\n98\n00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.365\nBut notice, it didn't make\na number three over here, did it?\n\n99\n00:05:21.365 --> 00:05:25.460\nNo, because it's on the same level.\n\n100\n00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.680\nI grouped these rows together, and\nthen I grouped those rows together.\n\n101\n00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.620\nThey're all on that level\ntwo of our outline.\n\n102\n00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.500\nSo if I click one, here let me zoom out so\nyou can see this, and scroll up.\n\n103\n00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.130\nNumber one is where all of\nour levels are collapsed.\n\n104\n00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.350\nLevel two is where everything at this\n\n105\n00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.320\npoint is expanded to the level two\ncuz it's the only few levels I have.\n\n106\n00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.300\nPretty me, pretty cool.\n\n107\n00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:53.450\nLet's keep on going.\n\n108\n00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:54.720\nLet's go over here.\n\n109\n00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:01.410\nI want to then make a whole\nother level of the social media.\n\n110\n00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.690\nI wanna be able to expand and\ncollapse those guys.\n\n111\n00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.200\nSo I select it and then I click Group.\n\n112\n00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.160\nAnd so\nnow you could see I've got a level three.\n\n113\n00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.200\nSo I could collapse the social media and\nthen just see design.\n\n114\n00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.850\nExpand the social media and\nnow I see that.\n\n115\n00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.870\nIf I go to level two or to level one,\nnotice that's where we can go.\n\n116\n00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.860\nSo you have to think about\ngroups within groups.\n\n117\n00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.020\nThis is one that gets me, because I'm\nthinking I wanna go ahead and make\n\n118\n00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:34.420\nthe design, another group, but look, it's\nthe same thing we did with the other one.\n\n119\n00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.462\nIf I select these and\nthen go ahead and make this a group,\n\n120\n00:06:38.462 --> 00:06:44.499\nI'm actually doing some weird things, and\nsee I've clicked it quite a few times.\n\n121\n00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:49.030\nI've just made a whole bunch of hidden\nlevels, which is really strange.\n\n122\n00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:55.400\nCuz remember, you have to think about\nwe were at 1, then we were at 2.\n\n123\n00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:01.100\nWhen I go to now 3, 4,\n5, they're all the same.\n\n124\n00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.848\nBecause remember, Social Media,\nonce I'm at level 2,\n\n125\n00:07:04.848 --> 00:07:10.060\nSocial media, and\nDesign are the same level.\n\n126\n00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:15.604\nSo you can't make, it's do you\nknow what I'm trying to say Wes?\n\n127\n00:07:15.604 --> 00:07:17.930\nIt's kind of hard to verbalize.\n\n128\n00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.050\nCuz people are like, I wanna make\na social media's expandable, and\n\n129\n00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:22.610\ndesign is expandable.\n\n130\n00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:24.220\nThat's not kinda how it works.\n\n131\n00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.730\nIt's like this within this,\nwithin this, within this, within this.\n\n132\n00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:29.390\nSo it's kinda like pieces\nlike nesting dolls, okay.\n\n133\n00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:32.890\nSo otherwise you're at the same level and\nif you click them too many times,\n\n134\n00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:37.880\nyou've just got yourself into a really\nweird kinda conundrum cause you're like,\n\n135\n00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:38.840\nwait, where am I?\n\n136\n00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.900\nI thought I'm on level six.\n\n137\n00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.466\nNo, you're not.\n\n138\n00:07:42.466 --> 00:07:45.440\nSo be careful about overclicking it.\n\n139\n00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:50.450\nAnd overdoing the grouping.\n\n140\n00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:53.453\nYou've got to nest them\ninside of each other.\n\n141\n00:07:53.453 --> 00:07:57.790\nthat is another one I'm like, hmm, I've\nkind of got myself a little out of whack.\n\n142\n00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:01.320\nHow can I reset myself?\n\n143\n00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.835\nIf you come back over here,\nwe'll actually ungroup.\n\n144\n00:08:03.835 --> 00:08:08.167\nSo if I go ahead and say I wanna go\nahead and clear the outline, well,\n\n145\n00:08:08.167 --> 00:08:10.450\nit's only clearing the one level.\n\n146\n00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:11.920\nSo what I would suggest doing,\n\n147\n00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:16.090\nif you wanna get rid of all of your\noutlines, I've kinda messed this up, okay?\n\n148\n00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:21.070\nYou go ahead and select the whole\nworksheet and then you clear the outline.\n\n149\n00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:24.180\nAnd watch what's gonna happen\nover here on the left-hand side.\n\n150\n00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:28.126\nIf I clear it, then everything goes away,\nI've cleared them all.\n\n151\n00:08:28.126 --> 00:08:33.555\nBecause all I'm doing is just different\nways of organizing my information for\n\n152\n00:08:33.555 --> 00:08:35.950\nhow I want to be able to see it.\n\n153\n00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:38.400\nMaking those collapsible and\nexpandable groups, okay.\n\n154\n00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.070\nAnd by the way,\nonce you clear your outline,\n\n155\n00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:45.540\nyou can't undo, you cannot get\nback out of this, let me back up.\n\n156\n00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.740\nSo if you clear it, you're done, and so\n\n157\n00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:52.530\nif you do have lots of levels, you're\ngonna have to go back into it again, okay?\n\n158\n00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:54.630\nBut as you could see,\nthat was pretty simple, whoops,\n\n159\n00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.190\nthat's is the wrong one I wanna do.\n\n160\n00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:00.902\nI don't wanna change the row height,\nlet's just go ahead and select these,\n\n161\n00:09:00.902 --> 00:09:04.758\nwe'll group them, we will select these,\nwe will group them.\n\n162\n00:09:04.758 --> 00:09:09.298\nCome back in,\nselect just the social media group, and\n\n163\n00:09:09.298 --> 00:09:12.520\nnotice there is my three levels.\n\n164\n00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:18.340\nLevel one, everything's collapsed, level\ntwo, let's expand those level twos out,\n\n165\n00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.530\nlevel three, go ahead and\nexpand out the social media.\n\n166\n00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:25.430\nSo see how that works of\nnesting your different\n\n167\n00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:28.430\ngroups within your groups, pretty cool.\n\n168\n00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:31.763\nAnd you can do this, not just on rows,\nyou can do this with columns too.\n\n169\n00:09:31.763 --> 00:09:36.048\nOkay, cuz maybe you have a sheet\nthat goes really far out.\n\n170\n00:09:36.048 --> 00:09:38.631\nI don't really need to see\nall of these all the time,\n\n171\n00:09:38.631 --> 00:09:42.460\nI don't wanna hide them,\nI wanna be able to expand and collapse.\n\n172\n00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:47.283\nSelect your columns,\ngroup them together, and notice that,\n\n173\n00:09:47.283 --> 00:09:50.113\nup on the top, I can have my outline.\n\n174\n00:09:50.113 --> 00:09:52.159\nSo if I click on level one,\n\n175\n00:09:52.159 --> 00:09:57.739\nthis is also something that's\na different variation of your freezes or\n\n176\n00:09:57.739 --> 00:10:04.078\nhiding your columns cuz I only wanna see\nthe team color next to the first and last.\n\n177\n00:10:04.078 --> 00:10:07.088\nOkay, so\njust different ways of looking at it,\n\n178\n00:10:07.088 --> 00:10:12.530\nif you're thinking I do that with\na freeze, yeah, you can, totally possible.\n\n179\n00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:16.020\nSo and then of course I could subdivide,\nlike maybe for\n\n180\n00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.590\nsome reason I want this\nto be another group.\n\n181\n00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:23.280\nSo now I have a level one,\na level two, and a level three.\n\n182\n00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:28.441\nOkay, so outlining, make them into groups.\n&gt;&gt; Now that's a very manual process,\n\n183\n00:10:28.441 --> 00:10:28.960\nright?\n\n184\n00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.827\nWhen it comes to it,\nwe got a lot of hands on work there, too.\n\n185\n00:10:30.827 --> 00:10:33.107\nSo be careful with the undo,\nlike Vonne said,\n\n186\n00:10:33.107 --> 00:10:35.500\nunless you like to start over, right?\n\n187\n00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:38.068\nHow about, can we let Excel do\nsome of the heavy lifting for us?\n\n188\n00:10:38.068 --> 00:10:39.645\n&gt;&gt; Yes, kind of [LAUGH] and\n\n189\n00:10:39.645 --> 00:10:46.680\nthat's where like, yeah, that'd awesome,\nbecause there is that auto outline, right?\n\n190\n00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.010\nLet me show you, let's first,\non this particular worksheet,\n\n191\n00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:50.120\nlet's clear everything out.\n\n192\n00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:53.690\nLike you said, we can't undo,\nbut let's, that's the wrong one,\n\n193\n00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:56.660\nlet's ungroup it,\nlet's clear the outline, okay.\n\n194\n00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:00.610\nSo you're thinking, cool,\njust go ahead and auto-outline, and\n\n195\n00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:02.340\nit doesn't see it here.\n\n196\n00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.838\nWonder why I made this a manual tab,\nand this one says auto outline.\n\n197\n00:11:07.838 --> 00:11:10.002\n&gt;&gt; I see what you did, sneaky there.\n\n198\n00:11:10.002 --> 00:11:12.674\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so as much as I would like it to,\n\n199\n00:11:12.674 --> 00:11:16.852\non that particular example,\nit doesn't have anything for\n\n200\n00:11:16.852 --> 00:11:20.530\nExcel to evaluate as I can group this.\n\n201\n00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:25.077\nBut it can if you have formulas,\nokay, because, let's look at this.\n\n202\n00:11:25.077 --> 00:11:30.414\nIf I have this, my weekly sales for\nthis particular group,\n\n203\n00:11:30.414 --> 00:11:35.643\nfor lack of better term,\nit is summing up B5 through F5,\n\n204\n00:11:35.643 --> 00:11:39.190\nthis one is summing up B4 through B7.\n\n205\n00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:45.521\nSo if you have formulas of where it's\nfinding the groups of information,\n\n206\n00:11:45.521 --> 00:11:52.171\nwhen you choose auto outline here,\nit's finding it based on your formulas.\n\n207\n00:11:52.171 --> 00:11:55.985\nWhich is kinda cool cuz now look,\nI have level one,\n\n208\n00:11:55.985 --> 00:11:59.180\nwhich is just all of my totals, right.\n\n209\n00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:01.390\nLevel two is these two sections,\n\n210\n00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:04.395\nif you wanna say,\nlevel three is all the details of that.\n\n211\n00:12:04.395 --> 00:12:08.700\nSo notice it went ahead and did,\njust like I did in the example of our\n\n212\n00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:13.290\nmanual outlining, that I had to select and\nmake groups within,\n\n213\n00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:19.410\nthis right here is within this, right?\n\n214\n00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:23.320\nSo it did it, but only because\nof the formulas and the rows and\n\n215\n00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.450\ncolumns, notice up here,\nsame thing, of where your\n\n216\n00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:29.242\nformulas are pulling from, okay.\n&gt;&gt; So all of your levels that it finds\n\n217\n00:12:29.242 --> 00:12:32.057\nare gonna be based on those formulas.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, and\n\n218\n00:12:32.057 --> 00:12:35.387\nthat's why if you have some\nsuper complex formulas,\n\n219\n00:12:35.387 --> 00:12:40.072\nit might throw your auto outlines for\nlike, that doesn't make any sense.\n\n220\n00:12:40.072 --> 00:12:43.516\nOkay, so just be careful about that,\nI specifically did this\n\n221\n00:12:43.516 --> 00:12:48.037\nvery intentionally to say,\nthat auto outlined beautifully, didn't it?\n\n222\n00:12:48.037 --> 00:12:50.686\nIt might not be that pretty and\nthat easy for\n\n223\n00:12:50.686 --> 00:12:55.690\nyou if your formulas are all over the\nplace and pulling from every which way.\n\n224\n00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:59.520\nOkay, so just be aware of it, and hey,\nthat wasn't that hard to try, was it?\n\n225\n00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:04.290\nAnd I didn't even on this one, and it just\nsaid hey, nope, sorry, can't do it, okay?\n\n226\n00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:07.690\nSo try it, if you don't like\nthe way it works, just clear them.\n\n227\n00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:11.160\nRemember, select it, and\ngo ahead and clear, and that's it.\n\n228\n00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:15.200\nSo you're really just changing your\nview of what you wanna see and\n\n229\n00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:20.470\nnot see, show and hide,\nif you wanna say and that's it.\n\n230\n00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:25.580\nSo no manipulation of the data,\npretty cool, so\n\n231\n00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:30.290\nthose are our outlines,\nwhich really are called groups, [LAUGH].\n\n232\n00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:33.870\nSubtotals, love this one, okay, so\n\n233\n00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:37.760\nI've got some information here,\nlet's zoom in, so you can see.\n\n234\n00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:41.570\nSo we've got first, last, department,\nteam color, number of calls, and sales.\n\n235\n00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:45.800\nGreat example of how you\nmight wanna use subtotals.\n\n236\n00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:49.290\nSo what if somebody says, okay,\nwell, I would like to see\n\n237\n00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:53.930\nthe total number of calls\nbased on departments, okay?\n\n238\n00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:57.190\nSo take all the marketing and\ngive me the number of calls.\n\n239\n00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:00.235\nAnd the advertising, and\nthe sales, and everything.\n\n240\n00:14:00.235 --> 00:14:05.620\nAnd maybe I'd also like to have\nan average of all the sales, okay?\n\n241\n00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.640\nGreat way, you just say,\nI wanna do some type of function,\n\n242\n00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.180\neven though this isn't a series\nabout performing functions.\n\n243\n00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:13.988\nWe know what adding does,\nwe know what averaging does,\n\n244\n00:14:13.988 --> 00:14:15.559\nwell most of the time, right?\n\n245\n00:14:15.559 --> 00:14:18.717\n[LAUGH] So we've got those, but I said,\n\n246\n00:14:18.717 --> 00:14:23.906\nat every change in department,\nthat's basically what I said.\n\n247\n00:14:23.906 --> 00:14:28.200\nSo you're going to do the same\nthin with Excel with subtotals.\n\n248\n00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:33.710\nThe biggest thing the you need to make\nsure, before you do this, you have to sort\n\n249\n00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:39.020\nby the column that you\nare wanting to add subtotals to.\n\n250\n00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:44.650\nLet's take a line and total us out,\ndo all these, do all these.\n\n251\n00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:46.610\nYou gotta sort,\nthat's the biggest thing, so\n\n252\n00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:49.670\nI said in this example,\nby department, right?\n\n253\n00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:53.538\nSo you click on the department column,\nlet's come over to, it's right there\n\n254\n00:14:53.538 --> 00:14:56.894\non the data tab, it's right there,\nlet's go ahead and sort a to z.\n\n255\n00:14:56.894 --> 00:14:59.581\nDidn't point that out in the sort and\nfilter, did I, but that's okay,\n\n256\n00:14:59.581 --> 00:15:00.340\nthey're here too.\n\n257\n00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:03.420\nI'm just so used to seeing it\non the home tab, honestly, so\n\n258\n00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:06.560\nthere's all the advertising,\nmarketing, and sales, okay.\n\n259\n00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:11.690\nAnd it is only by one column,\nlike the change in,\n\n260\n00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:16.110\nso you can't have, you can, but\nit's a totally different example, okay.\n\n261\n00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:19.620\nFor this one, single column,\nadvertising, sorted, good.\n\n262\n00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:21.790\nThe other thing, I'll just go ahead and\n\n263\n00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:24.110\nthrow this in right now,\nit cannot be in a table.\n\n264\n00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:28.160\nYou cannot have your cells formatted\nas a table and do subtotals.\n\n265\n00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.480\nIt doesn't work,\nthey treat them two different ways.\n\n266\n00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:35.108\nYou can do this really cool thing in\ntables that does like this total row, but\n\n267\n00:15:35.108 --> 00:15:36.480\nagain, we're not in tables yet.\n\n268\n00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.710\nOkay, you can tell I really like tables,\ndon't you?\n\n269\n00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:42.651\n[LAUGH] But you'd have to make sure\nyou convert your tables to a normal\n\n270\n00:15:42.651 --> 00:15:43.728\nrange first.\n\n271\n00:15:43.728 --> 00:15:48.700\nSo two conditions: did my sorting, now\nall I got to do is just add my subtotals.\n\n272\n00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:52.673\nNotice my cursor is just in\nthose contiguous range of cells.\n\n273\n00:15:52.673 --> 00:15:57.490\nWhen I click subtotals, it's going\nto find that range of information.\n\n274\n00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:03.591\nAnd then it says, okay, well what do\nyou want at each change in Department.\n\n275\n00:16:03.591 --> 00:16:07.133\nThat's what I want it\nto add my subtotals to.\n\n276\n00:16:07.133 --> 00:16:11.320\nAt every change of department,\nmeaning advertising do your thing.\n\n277\n00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.470\nMarketing, do your thing.\n\n278\n00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:16.700\nAnd so, that's why sorting is so\nvery important before you do this.\n\n279\n00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.583\nWhat function do you want to use?\n\n280\n00:16:18.583 --> 00:16:22.460\nCount, average, add,\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n281\n00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:26.620\nSo in this particular one,\nlet's go ahead and do our sum.\n\n282\n00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.540\nAnd I said the number of calls, right?\n\n283\n00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:35.853\nSo then, add every change in department,\ndo the summing of which columns?\n\n284\n00:16:35.853 --> 00:16:38.080\nProbably wouldn't make any sense\nas your team color, right?\n\n285\n00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.357\nCuz that's not a number.\n\n286\n00:16:39.357 --> 00:16:41.347\nI could do a count on that one,\nif I wanted to, but\n\n287\n00:16:41.347 --> 00:16:43.540\nthat wouldn't make any sense either.\n\n288\n00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:46.670\nBe careful about the different\ncheck boxes that you have.\n\n289\n00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:48.790\nI don't wanna do the sales right now,\nokay?\n\n290\n00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:53.593\nRemember, I said something about average,\npulleys like you would have to do twice,\n\n291\n00:16:53.593 --> 00:16:54.606\nwhich we will do.\n\n292\n00:16:54.606 --> 00:16:58.949\nI want to sum up all the number of calls,\nreplace current subtotals, that's fine,\n\n293\n00:16:58.949 --> 00:17:01.780\ndoesn't apply for\nright now cuz we've never done it.\n\n294\n00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:04.410\nWe can do a page break if I\nhad a lot of information.\n\n295\n00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:05.760\nThat's for printing and everything.\n\n296\n00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:06.930\nDon't need to do that.\n\n297\n00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:08.850\nAnd do I want a summary below?\n\n298\n00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:10.360\nSure, it's checked off, why not?\n\n299\n00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:10.860\nYou click OK.\n\n300\n00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:13.290\nMy gosh, there you go.\n\n301\n00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:14.600\nThat so cool.\n\n302\n00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:19.257\nNotice that we have the advertising total,\nthe marketing total,\n\n303\n00:17:19.257 --> 00:17:23.426\nthe sales and the grand total,\nand they're all together.\n\n304\n00:17:23.426 --> 00:17:26.800\nAnd the reason why we went over\noutlines first in this episode\n\n305\n00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.820\nbecause what did it do?\n\n306\n00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:30.600\nIt added an outline.\n\n307\n00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.180\nSo if I click on number one, there you go.\n\n308\n00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:36.700\nIt collapsed all of them and\njust gives me the grand total.\n\n309\n00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:42.040\nIf I click on number two,\nit gives me those different sections,\n\n310\n00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.750\ngroups, and\nthen it gives me those lines right there.\n\n311\n00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:47.320\nI click on number three, and\nit gives me all the details.\n\n312\n00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.548\nBut this is again, where I'm like,\nI don't really wanna see the advertising.\n\n313\n00:17:50.548 --> 00:17:52.820\nLet me focus on the marketing.\n\n314\n00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:54.790\nOkay, let me go ahead\nexpand that to sales.\n\n315\n00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:55.935\nYou see how cool this is?\n\n316\n00:17:55.935 --> 00:17:58.100\nIt's so easy to do.\n\n317\n00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.390\nSort, do your subtotals,\nboom, you're done.\n\n318\n00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:02.270\nI love this, okay.\n\n319\n00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:07.193\nSo that's where I can go ahead and\nadd that, add subtotals.\n\n320\n00:18:07.193 --> 00:18:12.210\nAnd then, the other thing I said, right,\nI said what if I also want to do,\n\n321\n00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:16.090\ngive me another line that gives\nme the average of the sales.\n\n322\n00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:19.220\nThat's what that checkbox, remember\nthat whole replace thing that we saw?\n\n323\n00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:23.767\nThat's where you've gotta be careful\nas do you want to replace it, or\n\n324\n00:18:23.767 --> 00:18:25.318\ndo you want to add to it?\n\n325\n00:18:25.318 --> 00:18:26.290\nLet's go through the examples.\n\n326\n00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:27.950\nSo I have this.\n\n327\n00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:30.209\nClicking anywhere in here,\ngo to Subtotals.\n\n328\n00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:37.010\nIf I choose Replace, let's just do it\nquickly, department, do the average\n\n329\n00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:41.930\nof the sales, and did not uncheck this.\n\n330\n00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:43.240\nWhat do you think it's gonna do?\n\n331\n00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.760\nIt's gonna replace them, okay?\n\n332\n00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.990\nIt's gonna take out the calls and\nreplace it with average.\n\n333\n00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:52.590\nSo that's one where if you're like,\nno, I didn't wanna do the calls,\n\n334\n00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:54.590\nI wanted to do the sales instead.\n\n335\n00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:55.420\nI'm just going to undo.\n\n336\n00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:57.250\nOops, I actually just\ngot rid of everything.\n\n337\n00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:58.396\nWhich is fine.\n\n338\n00:18:58.396 --> 00:18:59.977\nThat's fine.\nWe're okay, we're good.\n\n339\n00:18:59.977 --> 00:19:01.600\n[LAUGH] Sorry.\n\n340\n00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.790\nLet's go back here.\n\n341\n00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:06.980\nLet's go, at each change in\ndepartment we are going to add up,\n\n342\n00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.440\nuse the sum, of the number of calls.\n\n343\n00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.810\nCuz that's where we were.\n\n344\n00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:13.380\nWe can replace right now,\nbecause I undodid.\n\n345\n00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:13.890\nI undodid?\n\n346\n00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:17.510\n[LAUGH] To where we don't have\nany subtotals to begin with.\n\n347\n00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:19.785\nCool, let's do it again.\n\n348\n00:19:19.785 --> 00:19:24.650\nSubtotals, we're going to average,\n\n349\n00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:27.000\nnot the number of calls,\nmake sure you check off the box.\n\n350\n00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.750\nI want to average the sales, okay?\n\n351\n00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:31.360\nSo always be careful, cuz I do this too,\n\n352\n00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:35.160\ncuz I would have left that on and,\nno, okay?\n\n353\n00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:40.710\nSales do not replace,\nI want to just add that in, you click OK.\n\n354\n00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:44.590\nLook it there,\nnow I've got another subtotal line.\n\n355\n00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:45.820\nPretty cool.\n\n356\n00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:49.440\nSo there's my Grand Average and\nmy Grand Total.\n\n357\n00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:54.140\nAnd then, we have our different ones here,\nand then there.\n\n358\n00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:54.650\nLove it.\n\n359\n00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:55.390\nIt's so cool.\n\n360\n00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:56.200\nIt's so easy.\n\n361\n00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:00.130\nAnd I can think of a million different\nreasons of why you wanna use this.\n\n362\n00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:01.820\nI use this a lot, okay?\n\n363\n00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:08.650\nAnd when I show people how easy\nit really is they're like, man.\n\n364\n00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:10.770\nThe reports that my boss\nalways wants me to do, and\n\n365\n00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:13.550\nit's just click a couple buttons,\nand there you go.\n\n366\n00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:14.410\nPretty cool.\n\n367\n00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:17.040\nSo one thing, though, okay?\n\n368\n00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.980\nI don't know about you,\nWes, but I like this.\n\n369\n00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.720\nBut I want it to stand out\na little bit more, right?\n\n370\n00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.310\nDo you want that to stand out?\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n371\n00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:27.360\nI'm always thinking colors,\nor some kind of highlight,\n\n372\n00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:31.090\nmaybe a nice shade of pink.\n&gt;&gt; The glitter.\n\n373\n00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:33.280\nDan, right,\nyou were talking about glitter.\n\n374\n00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:37.021\nLet's go ahead and glitter this up\na little bit and make them stand out.\n\n375\n00:20:37.021 --> 00:20:37.976\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n376\n00:20:37.976 --> 00:20:40.610\n&gt;&gt; But I pointed this out for a reason.\n\n377\n00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:42.194\nIt's going to mess up.\n\n378\n00:20:42.194 --> 00:20:43.260\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n379\n00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:44.440\nSo let's go here.\n\n380\n00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:49.350\nIf I go to the row two, okay,\nor level two, sorry, not row.\n\n381\n00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:52.600\nLevel two, it's like okay,\nI wanna pull these out, so I do this.\n\n382\n00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:56.570\nYou're thinking I'm just gonna go\nahead and select these three rows and\n\n383\n00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:59.100\nthen I'm gonna go ahead and,\nyou said pink, right?\n\n384\n00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:02.650\nSo let's go ahead and\nget in some more cell colors.\n\n385\n00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:05.130\nWe're gonna, that's some pink!\n&gt;&gt; Boy, that's some pink.\n\n386\n00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:07.290\nI was almost gonna make the joke\nthat I think it's salmon.\n\n387\n00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:08.810\nBut no, that's pink.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's\n\n388\n00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:11.850\nalmost the color of my shirt right now,\nyeah, so that's great.\n\n389\n00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:12.780\nYou're like, yeah, it's perfect.\n\n390\n00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:15.440\nSo you come out here, and\nthen look at what it just did.\n\n391\n00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:19.030\nIt didn't just do those one rows, did it?\n&gt;&gt; No, it did not.\n\n392\n00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:20.510\n&gt;&gt; It did all of it, yeah.\n\n393\n00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:22.580\nSo it's like, ooh.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n394\n00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:24.118\nyou wanted it to stand out.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n395\n00:21:24.118 --> 00:21:25.956\n&gt;&gt; And it does, I can tell you that,\n\n396\n00:21:25.956 --> 00:21:26.821\nit stands out.\n\n397\n00:21:26.821 --> 00:21:29.220\nBut not exactly what you\nwanted to stand out, right?\n\n398\n00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.670\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, I just wanted those one rows.\n\n399\n00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:34.020\nSo the thing that you just\ngotta be a little careful,\n\n400\n00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.360\nI'm I'm just doing an Undo.\n\n401\n00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:39.620\nOnce you get it to the level where you\ncan see it, yes, these are just hiding,\n\n402\n00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:40.760\nthey're collapsed.\n\n403\n00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:45.110\nBut when you made a selection from here\nto here, even look at the numbers.\n\n404\n00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:49.890\nYou selected from row 10 to 29,\nand everything in between.\n\n405\n00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:53.460\nSo get it to where you like,\njust remember your Control key.\n\n406\n00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:54.850\nSorry, not Control, we're in Mac.\n\n407\n00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:56.080\nCommand, okay?\n\n408\n00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:59.290\nMake one selection, hold your Command key.\n\n409\n00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:02.360\nMake this selection, make this selection.\n\n410\n00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:07.217\nSo I'm actually making three selections,\nnon-contiguous ranges of cells,\n\n411\n00:22:07.217 --> 00:22:11.020\neven though they look they\nare right next to each other.\n\n412\n00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:16.160\nAnd then, if I apply it, now if I go to\nfour, okay, see, that's what I need to do.\n\n413\n00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:23.100\nSo you can use your levels to get what you\nwanna see, like your little subtotal rows.\n\n414\n00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:27.350\nBut use the Command key to make multiple\nselections if you wanna format it\n\n415\n00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.910\ndifferently.\n\n416\n00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:32.180\nSo that's just something that I've always\nkinda realized throughout the years and\n\n417\n00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:33.070\nlike to show people.\n\n418\n00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:38.250\nCuz it's like, I like it, but if I\ncould just change this one part of it.\n\n419\n00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:40.020\nSo that's what I like to do.\n\n420\n00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:43.090\nI love subtotals,\nI think they're really cool.\n\n421\n00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:46.700\nI don't want any of them on there anymore,\nI just want to get rid of them.\n\n422\n00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.200\nWell, if you go back over to data, and\n\n423\n00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:54.450\nyou go to subtotals,\nyou see where I can just remove all?\n\n424\n00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:57.050\nThen it removes them all, okay?\n\n425\n00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:58.740\nSo that's an easy way to get rid of it.\n\n426\n00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:02.700\nSo again, not doing too much\ncrazy manipulation of your data,\n\n427\n00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:09.060\nyou're not adding all these crazy\nformulas, you Sort, you do the Change By,\n\n428\n00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:12.030\nwhat kind of function, and\nwhat calls you wanted to add to it.\n\n429\n00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:14.430\nYou could have done it for\nthe Calls and the Sales.\n\n430\n00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:17.980\nYou don't have to choose just one, okay?\n\n431\n00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:19.520\nSo just do it however many times.\n\n432\n00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.340\nAnd if it messes up, just remove them and\nstart over and see what happens.\n\n433\n00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:25.160\nSo there you go.\n&gt;&gt; Outline on Excel, that's right.\n\n434\n00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:28.610\nAnd more specifically,\nExcel 2016 advanced for Mac.\n\n435\n00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:31.970\nNow Vaughn, as always, it does look\nlike we're coming to the end of another\n\n436\n00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:34.530\nepisode, but before we do, do you have any\nfinal words that maybe you would like to\n\n437\n00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:37.132\nimpart to the viewers?\n&gt;&gt; I guess the only last thing on that\n\n438\n00:23:37.132 --> 00:23:39.850\nsubtotals is we were doing\nit by department, right, and\n\n439\n00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:40.835\nthen we cleared them out.\n\n440\n00:23:40.835 --> 00:23:43.735\nCuz maybe you want to change by last name.\n\n441\n00:23:43.735 --> 00:23:45.665\nI don't think that makes any sense here.\n\n442\n00:23:45.665 --> 00:23:48.745\nBut you can always just remove them,\nthen sort\n\n443\n00:23:48.745 --> 00:23:53.465\nthe column that you want that change\nby,and then go back and add subtotals.\n\n444\n00:23:53.465 --> 00:23:57.495\nAgain, it's always that sorting\nof what you want it to change by.\n\n445\n00:23:57.495 --> 00:24:00.715\nThat's something to just always remember.\n&gt;&gt; Outlines and subtotals in Excel.\n\n446\n00:24:00.715 --> 00:24:03.925\nAnd more specifically, that's right,\nExcel 2016 Advanced for Mac,\n\n447\n00:24:03.925 --> 00:24:05.955\nthat is a great place to wrap this one up,\nVonne.\n\n448\n00:24:05.955 --> 00:24:08.230\nSo what do you say,\nwe'll go ahead and we'll sign out.\n\n449\n00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:10.070\nWe appreciate having you in the studios.\n\n450\n00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:12.740\nAnd as always, we appreciate you,\nthe viewer, watching.\n\n451\n00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:15.460\nRemember to check out\nthe entire OFFICEPRO.TV\n\n452\n00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:19.200\nlibrary that Vonne's been

OFFICEPRO.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.169\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and today's\nepisode well we are taking a look at\n\n4\n00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:22.616\ntables inside of our Excel Advanced for\nMac.\n\n5\n00:00:22.616 --> 00:00:26.433\nAnd joining me in the studio, you know our\ngood friend that knows everything there is\n\n6\n00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:29.980\nto know about this lovely little program\nour good friend, Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.430\nVonne we're glad to have you yet\nagain, how goes it today?\n\n8\n00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.601\nIt's going good, everything, eh,\nthat might be stretching it.\n\n9\n00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:39.451\n[LAUGH] Listen I'm trying to\nincrease your methos like build.\n\n10\n00:00:39.451 --> 00:00:40.307\nMy methos what?\n\n11\n00:00:40.307 --> 00:00:41.990\nYeah Is that my world?\n\n12\n00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.095\nYeah you're like a Greek\ngoddess of Excel knowledge.\n\n13\n00:00:46.095 --> 00:00:47.970\nGosh, I think we need to\njust stop right here.\n\n14\n00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.010\nSo don't mess up?\n\n15\n00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.730\nYeah no pressure you're\nalready throwing out words.\n\n16\n00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.080\nShe's like is it hot in here?\n\n17\n00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.690\nIt seems hot.\n\n18\n00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.011\n[LAUGH] I know you're throwing out\nvocabulary that I'm like, what's that?\n\n19\n00:00:58.011 --> 00:01:04.640\n[LAUGH] But a vocabulary word in Excel\nthat I do know a lot about is tables.\n\n20\n00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.690\nI love me some tables in Excel,\nI use them all the time.\n\n21\n00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.110\nI think they are fantastic and I hope\nyou will find them just as fantastic as\n\n22\n00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.280\nI do after this episode because,\nwell, they're pretty cool.\n\n23\n00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.090\nSo, I have a file ready to go cuz it's\nprobably the easiest way to explain it\n\n24\n00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.800\nthan to demonstrate it.\n\n25\n00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.100\nSo why don't we jump on down.\n\n26\n00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.250\nWe have a file named tables,\nwe got some worksheets going on in here.\n\n27\n00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.175\nAnd right now these,\na few of these are tables.\n\n28\n00:01:31.175 --> 00:01:34.105\nAnd that's kind of a weird thing\nbecause if I was just saying\n\n29\n00:01:34.105 --> 00:01:37.945\nnot within Excel world,\nwhat would you say is, what is a table?\n\n30\n00:01:37.945 --> 00:01:38.995\nWhat is a table made of?\n\n31\n00:01:38.995 --> 00:01:41.755\nA table is made up of,\nlike cross reference data.\n\n32\n00:01:41.755 --> 00:01:43.600\nCross-reference data.\n\n33\n00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.282\nI was going for just rows and columns.\n\n34\n00:01:45.282 --> 00:01:47.644\n[LAUGH] Well, yeah,\nI guess that's what's happening.\n\n35\n00:01:47.644 --> 00:01:49.423\n[SOUND] And there's the data.\n\n36\n00:01:49.423 --> 00:01:50.110\nExactly.\n\n37\n00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.760\nAnd you're like, well, this is Excel,\n\n38\n00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.130\na worksheet is just nothing but\nrows and columns.\n\n39\n00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.810\nThat's true.\n\n40\n00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.160\nSo, how is a table any\ndifferent than a worksheet?\n\n41\n00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.220\nWell, it is something specific that\nthey use in Excel, that is saying that\n\n42\n00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.420\nthis is a special group or range of\ncells that is formatted as a table.\n\n43\n00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.020\nSo you're carving out a certain\nset of rows and cells to say,\n\n44\n00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.490\nthis little demarked area is the table and\nnot necessarily just random data?\n\n45\n00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.340\nCorrect, and it's special and\n\n46\n00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.950\nit has some special features that allows\nyou to do things with that particular\n\n47\n00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.720\nformatted type of data range that\nis different than a worksheet.\n\n48\n00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.470\nJust stuff on a page, if you wanna say.\n\n49\n00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.580\nSo yes,\nit's a very good definition of that.\n\n50\n00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.071\nSo right here,\nthis one right here is a table,\n\n51\n00:02:40.071 --> 00:02:45.633\nnow how do I know that cells A1 through\nD9, how do I know that's a table?\n\n52\n00:02:45.633 --> 00:02:51.030\nThere's a few very key indicators\nthat I can point out right here.\n\n53\n00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.250\nIt's kind of tiny, but\n\n54\n00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.840\nthere's this kind of corner\nlooking thing down at the bottom.\n\n55\n00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.060\nWhen you see that,\n\n56\n00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.710\nthat is indicating that this is\nthe bottom corner of this table in Excel.\n\n57\n00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.860\nThe other thing that I know this is\na table is these little drop downs.\n\n58\n00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.840\nNow these little things\nwe've seen these before.\n\n59\n00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.960\nWe've did this in the filter,\nwhere we did the sort and filter.\n\n60\n00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.680\nTurn on the filters and\nyou go ahead put those little drop downs.\n\n61\n00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.740\nSo you're like, well that's, I wanna\nsay that's always the be all end all,\n\n62\n00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:19.870\nthis is a table.\n\n63\n00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.820\nThis could be just filters that's not as a\ntable, it's a little weird in there, okay?\n\n64\n00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.110\n[LAUGH] But\nthose are two things that I can look at.\n\n65\n00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.910\nThe other thing that I find that I would\nknow that it's a table is the formatting.\n\n66\n00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.760\nDo you see how we have the, I want\nto say variated, alternating colors,\n\n67\n00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:44.130\nwithin our rows, and we have a nice pink\noutline, and this is a darker border.\n\n68\n00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.610\nAll of this formatting,\n\n69\n00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.350\nthis is a big indicator to me that\nthis is formatted as a table.\n\n70\n00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.830\nCould you go ahead and\nformat that individually?\n\n71\n00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.230\nYeah, but it would take a lot of time, cuz\nyou'd have to select individual cells and\n\n72\n00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.580\nalternating rows, no.\n\n73\n00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.750\nThe other biggest thing that\nI know that this is a table,\n\n74\n00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.490\nif I click in any one of these\ncells we get this little guy.\n\n75\n00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:07.930\nI'm gonna test your knowledge there,\nDaniel,\n\n76\n00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.230\nsince you're throwing out stuff like\nmythos and ethos at me, I'm like, what?\n\n77\n00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.130\n[LAUGH] Do you know what this little\nthing is referred to up in our ribbon?\n\n78\n00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.110\nThis particular tab.\n\n79\n00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:17.645\nI like to call them tabs.\n\n80\n00:04:17.645 --> 00:04:20.820\n[LAUGH] It's a special tab, though.\n\n81\n00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.840\nIt's a format tab.\n\n82\n00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.720\nIt's a contextual tab.\n\n83\n00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.160\nThere we go, she's trying!\n\n84\n00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.700\nIt's a tab that only shows\nup when it's needed.\n\n85\n00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.230\nCuz if I were to click off\ninto this regular cell,\n\n86\n00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.680\nnotice there is- It goes away.\n\n87\n00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.540\nExactly!\n\n88\n00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:40.480\nClick in it, brings up the contextual\ntab to say that hey, this is a table.\n\n89\n00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.630\nI like the little animation, too.\n\n90\n00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.310\nIt just kinda pops up, hi, I'm here.\n\n91\n00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.077\nYep.\nThen it goes away.\n\n92\n00:04:44.077 --> 00:04:44.943\n[LAUGH] Hi, yeah.\n\n93\n00:04:44.943 --> 00:04:49.930\n[LAUGH] So that's the biggest thing\nthat you could do, is click in there.\n\n94\n00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.690\nIf that contextual tab comes up,\nyou definitely know it's in a table.\n\n95\n00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.560\nAll right, but for example, this one,\nyep, I got that little corner.\n\n96\n00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.260\nThat corner's probably one\nof the bigger ones, too.\n\n97\n00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.370\nThen if I look over here\non this particular cells,\n\n98\n00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.970\nthis looks like it you know its\ngot the- It's very table like.\n\n99\n00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:06.950\nRight, Yeah.\n\n100\n00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:07.730\nVery much so.\n\n101\n00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.620\nBut if I click on the cells.\n\n102\n00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.250\nAnd there's no little corner thingy.\n\n103\n00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.260\nNo corner thingy, there's no dropdown\nthingies, and there's no contextual tab.\n\n104\n00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.202\nIt's a poser.\n\n105\n00:05:16.202 --> 00:05:21.180\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] Exactly right, so this was\na table and I actually converted it into\n\n106\n00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.350\na normal range but\nwe'll talk about that in a second.\n\n107\n00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.000\nSo just kind of identifying that\nwhat do you need to look for\n\n108\n00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.570\nwhen you have these tables?\n\n109\n00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.632\nAnd the cool thing about with these tables\nis you can have the drop downs like we\n\n110\n00:05:33.632 --> 00:05:35.331\nhave with our regular filters.\n\n111\n00:05:35.331 --> 00:05:40.880\nOkay, that's nothing new or fancy,\nbecause they're just filters, all right?\n\n112\n00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.810\nBut the formatting up here, some of\nthe options that you have are really cool.\n\n113\n00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.930\nOne of them,\nsince I like to do things in colors,\n\n114\n00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.680\nit's right here with all of our styles.\n\n115\n00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:57.300\nI can quickly apply a style,\nsay like this one, and boom, there you go.\n\n116\n00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.820\nWent ahead and changed the font,\nit changed the colors of the rows,\n\n117\n00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.700\nwe have the alternating colors.\n\n118\n00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.740\nThat would take forever if\nyou were doing this manually.\n\n119\n00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.690\nAnd don't dismiss the stylistic approach\nas something that's just mere fun, right.\n\n120\n00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.679\nReally can help visually see\nthe entire picture for what it is.\n\n121\n00:06:13.679 --> 00:06:16.415\nYou know that green is this area,\nblue is that area,\n\n122\n00:06:16.415 --> 00:06:19.025\nand color coding things\ncan really be helpful when\n\n123\n00:06:19.025 --> 00:06:22.930\nyou're trying to quickly jump to\na section in your Excel spreadsheet.\n\n124\n00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.250\nYeah, and especially when you're reading\ndown, having those alternating row colors,\n\n125\n00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.390\nit really helps your eye.\n\n126\n00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.950\nBreaks it up.\n\n127\n00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.340\nRather than taking a piece of paper and\n\n128\n00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.890\nputting it up against\nyour computer monitor.\n\n129\n00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.010\nThat is annoying.\n\n130\n00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.219\nYeah, I've done it.\n\n131\n00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:34.736\nI have too.\n\n132\n00:06:34.736 --> 00:06:35.266\nYeah, exactly.\n\n133\n00:06:35.266 --> 00:06:37.433\nBecause your eyes Recently.\n\n134\n00:06:37.433 --> 00:06:38.810\nAnd your eye jumps.\n\n135\n00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.781\nSo having that color coordinating\nfill of your rows is much easier\n\n136\n00:06:42.781 --> 00:06:47.272\nto follow the information than if you\njust it as regular formatted cells.\n\n137\n00:06:47.272 --> 00:06:50.630\nSo, that's pretty cool, I like them.\n\n138\n00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.210\nSome other things you\nshould know about tables.\n\n139\n00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:58.650\nThey are, each one of these are acting\nindependently from each other.\n\n140\n00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:03.550\nNow when you start getting multiple\ntables within the same rows,\n\n141\n00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.340\nthis can get a little weird.\n\n142\n00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:06.550\nSo let me show you what I mean.\n\n143\n00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.631\nBecause I've had a lot of experience\nover the years of watching\n\n144\n00:07:10.631 --> 00:07:12.330\npeople work with tables.\n\n145\n00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.380\nSo it's like, hey,\nI wanna put in a new row.\n\n146\n00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.230\nRight, you just come over here and\nyou insert a row right.\n\n147\n00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:22.820\nIf I was down here in regular cell land,\nand I wanted to insert a row above it.\n\n148\n00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:27.710\nI right click on the row reference and\nI go with insert and it inserts a row.\n\n149\n00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:32.560\nTotally fine, but that's different\nwhen you start working within a table.\n\n150\n00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.890\nIf I wanted to add a row\nwithin this table and not kind\n\n151\n00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:41.590\nof effect some of the other things,\nthen you don't come over here, all right?\n\n152\n00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.810\nYou don't wanna go over to the row that,\ncuz that's the worksheet.\n\n153\n00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:48.090\nThis is a specially\nformatted area of cells.\n\n154\n00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:51.280\nSo you want to insert, and\nthis is the best example cuz remember,\n\n155\n00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.370\nthese are just regular cells, all right?\n\n156\n00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:55.144\nThis is a table, these are regular cells.\n\n157\n00:07:55.144 --> 00:08:00.961\nIf I come over here into any of my\ncells within my table I right-click.\n\n158\n00:08:00.961 --> 00:08:06.330\nNotice I have a table row above,\nand a table column, right?\n\n159\n00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:10.138\nIf I do a table column to the left,\nnotice that it added it here, but\n\n160\n00:08:10.138 --> 00:08:12.600\nit didn't do anything to up here, did it?\n\n161\n00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:17.533\nNo, because these are two independent\nbodies of data that I ended\n\n162\n00:08:17.533 --> 00:08:22.390\nup column in this table,\nnot a column in the Excel spreadsheet.\n\n163\n00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:26.500\nAs opposed if I had done\nup here in Column C, and\n\n164\n00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.560\nnotice actually here,\ninsert's not even available.\n\n165\n00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.630\nIt doesn't even show up.\n\n166\n00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:33.025\nNo, because that's where you have two\ntables- Is that because of the two\n\n167\n00:08:33.025 --> 00:08:34.832\ntables being aligned up and them going,\n\n168\n00:08:34.832 --> 00:08:37.236\nhey [INAUDIBLE] it's gonna\nget a little jiminy weird.\n\n169\n00:08:37.236 --> 00:08:39.610\n[LAUGH] Yeah, exactly, like over here.\n\n170\n00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:42.470\nSo notice my regular cells.\n\n171\n00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:45.416\nIf I came in and\nit will allow me to do it here.\n\n172\n00:08:45.416 --> 00:08:48.640\nAnd that's gonna go for\nthe whole worksheet.\n\n173\n00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.120\nBoth of these areas add a column,\nI'm just gonna undo,\n\n174\n00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:57.140\nas opposed to coming into\nhere inserting we'll go with\n\n175\n00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:02.060\ncolumns to the left, it as it in this\ntable and not these cells, okay?\n\n176\n00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:06.630\nSo yeah, when they get stacked\non each other either this way or\n\n177\n00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:08.210\nthis way, they can get a little weird.\n\n178\n00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:12.430\nBut that is another indication\nlike why can't I add a row, or\n\n179\n00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:14.410\nwhy can't I insert a column.\n\n180\n00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:17.070\nBecause of the way\nthe information's formatted.\n\n181\n00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:18.440\nSo just things to look out for.\n\n182\n00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.790\nDo I use a lot of worksheets that have\nmultiple tables on the same worksheet?\n\n183\n00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:26.290\nHonestly, not really.\n\n184\n00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:30.800\nI mean, I usually have all of\nthe information on one sheet just be\n\n185\n00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.220\nthat one sheet, and if I want something\nelse, I put it on a different worksheet.\n\n186\n00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:35.400\nBut, you can, so yes.\n\n187\n00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.750\nI would assume there are times\nwhen tabular data and\n\n188\n00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:40.220\nyou want multiple tables for it.\n\n189\n00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:44.310\nWell, this goes along with that, but\nI need it separated for x, y or z reason.\n\n190\n00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:47.100\nExactly, and the things I'm gonna show you\nof what you can do with your total rows,\n\n191\n00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:52.110\nif you wanted that data on the same\nworksheet, there's nothing wrong with it.\n\n192\n00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:54.310\nJust know it's just to each his own.\n\n193\n00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:56.490\nNow, are you able to\nconnect the tables at all?\n\n194\n00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:57.540\nSo if I had a table here and\n\n195\n00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.960\na table here, they're both kind of\npulling from the same information.\n\n196\n00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.660\nAnd I had, I did want a row or\na comma, effective both at one time,\n\n197\n00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:06.340\nam I able to do that?\n\n198\n00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:07.330\nI wouldn't, no.\n\n199\n00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:08.760\nEven if you couldn't suggest it?\n\n200\n00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.730\nYeah, I would say that,\n\n201\n00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:13.978\nsince they are treated like\nindependent units of information.\n\n202\n00:10:13.978 --> 00:10:16.420\nKind of cross-referencing that?\n\n203\n00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.450\nThat might get a little bit\nmore than what they do.\n\n204\n00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:19.870\nMight, yeah.\n\n205\n00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:21.030\nI'm sure it's possible.\n\n206\n00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:21.750\nYou never know,\n\n207\n00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:25.291\nthese computers are little voodoo boxes,\nyou never know what they can do.\n\n208\n00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:28.171\n[LAUGH] Yeah, and\nmy knowledge of how I use tables, to me,\n\n209\n00:10:28.171 --> 00:10:29.820\nI just wouldn't do it that way.\n\n210\n00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.570\nBut that doesn't mean it doesn't exist,\nso I'll put an asterisk or\n\n211\n00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.765\nsomething under that and say probably not.\n\n212\n00:10:34.765 --> 00:10:36.619\n[LAUGH] Absolutely, positively maybe.\n\n213\n00:10:36.619 --> 00:10:40.010\n[LAUGH] Throwing the curve ball already.\n\n214\n00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:41.164\nThat's my job, right?\n\n215\n00:10:41.164 --> 00:10:42.745\n[LAUGH] All right, cool.\n\n216\n00:10:42.745 --> 00:10:47.624\nSo now you get an idea of how to kind of\njust get some with your tables but let's\n\n217\n00:10:47.624 --> 00:10:52.260\ngo ahead and take in and format some cells\nas a table and see what we can do with it.\n\n218\n00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:56.200\nSo here we have just some basic\ninformation right, we've got our cats and\n\n219\n00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.380\nwe've got did they fill out their form?\n\n220\n00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:01.640\nI'm keeping track of that like I'm\njust putting a little x in there.\n\n221\n00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:06.180\nWe have some sales and maybe their\ntotal phone calls that they made for\n\n222\n00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:07.750\nthe week or something to that effect.\n\n223\n00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.920\nI want to make this a table.\n\n224\n00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.460\nIt is a contiguous area of data.\n\n225\n00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:13.830\nOkay, so that's one thing.\n\n226\n00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:17.670\nIf it's all broken up, it's not gonna\nunderstand how to format it as a table.\n\n227\n00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:19.760\nSo we got that.\n\n228\n00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.670\nAnywhere in the data,\ndoesn't matter where.\n\n229\n00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:24.995\nYou come up to the Home tab over here,\n\n230\n00:11:24.995 --> 00:11:28.300\nthere's a button that\nsays Format as Table.\n\n231\n00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.740\nAnd then you pick your initial formatting.\n\n232\n00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:36.440\nNow, notice you can have just light\nformatting, or just very basic formatting.\n\n233\n00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.496\nYou don't have to get all crazy\ncolorful in here if you don't want to.\n\n234\n00:11:39.496 --> 00:11:42.080\nAnd where are these colors pulling from?\n\n235\n00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.960\nIt'ss your document theme.\n\n236\n00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:47.094\nIf you change your theme,\nall of these are going to change.\n\n237\n00:11:47.094 --> 00:11:48.345\nI'll give you that in just a second.\n\n238\n00:11:48.345 --> 00:11:51.021\nYou know what I'm going to pick Daniel.\n\n239\n00:11:51.021 --> 00:11:53.108\nI'm going pink.\n\n240\n00:11:53.108 --> 00:11:56.258\nSo it automatically found\nthat cell that I was in,\n\n241\n00:11:56.258 --> 00:12:00.308\nfound all the contiguous information\naround it, went ahead and\n\n242\n00:12:00.308 --> 00:12:03.690\nsays hey I see that this is\nyour data You have headers.\n\n243\n00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:04.920\nI can see that row there.\n\n244\n00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:05.910\nIs that what you want?\n\n245\n00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:06.660\nYou say, okay.\n\n246\n00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.399\nThis is where you could go out and\n\n247\n00:12:08.399 --> 00:12:11.440\nselect it if it didn't judge\nwhere the boundaries are.\n\n248\n00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.430\nBut most of the time\nit does it no problem.\n\n249\n00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:16.990\nYou click OK, and there you go.\n\n250\n00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:19.460\nI know it's a table because of all\nthe little things we pointed out.\n\n251\n00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.370\nAnd I got my contextual tab.\n\n252\n00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.760\nSo you can see all of these colors.\n\n253\n00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.710\nLet's go change that theme for\na second, we go to page layout and\n\n254\n00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:33.010\ngo to theme, and we'll pick, Parallax?\n\n255\n00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:34.070\nNotice that it's green.\n\n256\n00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:38.810\nAnd then all my table styles\nare going to be based on that\n\n257\n00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:42.910\nparticular themes color And\nall the tables that I had, whoops, sorry.\n\n258\n00:12:43.924 --> 00:12:45.189\nWorksheet, not the Home tab.\n\n259\n00:12:45.189 --> 00:12:49.228\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] All of these have\nchanged their font and colors as well,\n\n260\n00:12:49.228 --> 00:12:51.190\ncuz they're all theme based.\n\n261\n00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:55.520\nAnd it's just easier, pick a theme,\nfind one, don't get so\n\n262\n00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.630\ncrazy trying to super modify it.\n\n263\n00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:01.250\nTake it for what it is,\nit's much easier that way.\n\n264\n00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:04.620\nSo now I've got this, okay,\nnow it's green, perfect.\n\n265\n00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.200\nGot my drop downs cuz this\nis maybe something like I\n\n266\n00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:10.870\nonly wanna see the developer,\nso I uncheck the Select All.\n\n267\n00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:15.720\nDevelopers and there you go, again very\nsimilar to just our regular apply filters\n\n268\n00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:19.388\non your sets of data,\ntotally fine with that.\n\n269\n00:13:19.388 --> 00:13:24.510\nSo the coolest thing about them is\ndefinitely the quickly applied styles and\n\n270\n00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:25.130\nthe formatting.\n\n271\n00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:30.940\nThat being said,\nyou can customize some of this because\n\n272\n00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:35.330\nmaybe I have information that\ngoes across more than down.\n\n273\n00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.120\nI have a lot of columns.\n\n274\n00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:42.290\nSo maybe the alternating colors\nthat I'm applying on this.\n\n275\n00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:45.630\nI don't want to be as your rows,\nI want to be as columns.\n\n276\n00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:49.580\nSo right up here,\nyou have these little table style options.\n\n277\n00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:52.530\nBut unchecked, the banded rows,\nmaybe you don't want them banded at all.\n\n278\n00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:54.114\nYou love that white sheet\nof paper on the thing.\n\n279\n00:13:54.114 --> 00:13:55.805\n[LAUGH] It's just how you roll.\n\n280\n00:13:55.805 --> 00:13:56.961\nExactly, go for it.\n\n281\n00:13:56.961 --> 00:14:00.255\nTape them together so it goes across\na really wide- We'll call them in and\n\n282\n00:14:00.255 --> 00:14:02.478\nhave you [INAUDIBLE],\ncuz you're obviously crazy.\n\n283\n00:14:02.478 --> 00:14:07.381\n[LAUGH] So I can take the banded off and\nI can band the column so\n\n284\n00:14:07.381 --> 00:14:11.260\nthat's something again that's\njust going to change that.\n\n285\n00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.940\nYou probably don't want to put\nthe banded rows in columns.\n\n286\n00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:14.810\nThat just kinda.\n\n287\n00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:15.840\nThat gets a little weird.\n\n288\n00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.490\nYeah.\nThat reminds me of the dot matrix\n\n289\n00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:20.950\nprinter paper with that green color.\n\n290\n00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:22.126\nMan, it looks just like it, doesn't it?\n\n291\n00:14:22.126 --> 00:14:22.745\nMy gosh, right?\n\n292\n00:14:22.745 --> 00:14:23.642\nYeah.\nYes!\n\n293\n00:14:23.642 --> 00:14:24.248\nThat's crazy.\n\n294\n00:14:24.248 --> 00:14:25.858\nMy gosh.\nWe were talking 80s references\n\n295\n00:14:25.858 --> 00:14:26.879\nbefore we started the show.\n\n296\n00:14:26.879 --> 00:14:27.860\nYeah [LAUGH].\n\n297\n00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.000\nWhere my mind is at right now.\n\n298\n00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.169\nExactly, yes, yeah.\n\n299\n00:14:32.169 --> 00:14:33.481\n[LAUGH] Moving on.\n\n300\n00:14:33.481 --> 00:14:35.758\nSorry, I'm like, I'm reading this\nbook that has the reference.\n\n301\n00:14:35.758 --> 00:14:37.630\nShe's lost in the nostaligia right now.\n\n302\n00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:39.410\nSeriously, I'm obssesed with it.\n\n303\n00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:42.020\nOkay, so anyways,\nyou can see that we have your columns and\n\n304\n00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:43.540\nyour rows, you can do that.\n\n305\n00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:46.460\nAnd then you can also\nformat your last column.\n\n306\n00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.650\nNow on this particular one,\nnotice, it just made it bold.\n\n307\n00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:53.150\nIf turn on the first column,\nand then I turn on your banded.\n\n308\n00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:54.930\nI mean, we'll probably just do that.\n\n309\n00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:58.830\nAnd then it just changes the format of\nthat first column or that last column.\n\n310\n00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:01.660\nIf you change the style,\nlike for example if I go down.\n\n311\n00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:03.870\nNow you can actually\nsee the representations\n\n312\n00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:06.130\nof the thumbnails have changed.\n\n313\n00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:11.200\nBecause I had turned on the first and\nlast column as being part\n\n314\n00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:15.610\nof the styles that I would like to\napply within this particular one.\n\n315\n00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:18.650\nSo there.\nThere's one that will show the first and\n\n316\n00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:22.520\nlast column a little bit more visual for\nus.\n\n317\n00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:27.760\nCuz this is the type of I think\nit's like a bold- there are medium.\n\n318\n00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.670\nMedium and dark, okay?\n\n319\n00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:30.190\nAnd light.\n\n320\n00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:32.720\nI thought they were bold but\nanyway, you get the idea.\n\n321\n00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.940\nSo more profound, less crazy.\n\n322\n00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:39.700\n[LAUGH] Yay, so we've got these different\nones so that's all of these guys.\n\n323\n00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:42.358\nYes, you do want filter buttons\nmost of the time but if you don't,\n\n324\n00:15:42.358 --> 00:15:43.570\nyou can turn them off.\n\n325\n00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:45.356\nI really like them cuz\nthey're pretty cool.\n\n326\n00:15:45.356 --> 00:15:48.479\nAnd you wanna probably keep\nyour header row, okay?\n\n327\n00:15:48.479 --> 00:15:52.532\nNow this is just the formatting,\nso it's not taking it away.\n\n328\n00:15:52.532 --> 00:15:56.695\nAgain, if I change to a style\nthat actually have a dark text,\n\n329\n00:15:56.695 --> 00:16:00.380\nnotice that it's just taking\nthe formatting there.\n\n330\n00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:02.300\nActually, it's just taking the text there,\ntoo.\n\n331\n00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:03.430\nYou know what, don't do that, okay?\n\n332\n00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:05.515\nJust keep your head on.\n\n333\n00:16:05.515 --> 00:16:08.110\n[LAUGH] I can't give any reason\nwhy you'd wanna take that off.\n\n334\n00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:09.630\nOkay, cool.\n\n335\n00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:15.210\nSome of neat ways that we can do this,\nbut my other favorite part\n\n336\n00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:19.400\nformatting this data as text,\nis a total row.\n\n337\n00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.690\nWhen you add the total row,\nit does exactly that.\n\n338\n00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:26.020\nIt adds this special row,\n\n339\n00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:32.160\ndown at the bottom of your table that\nwill perform table calculations.\n\n340\n00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:36.840\nIt automatically is gonna\nput it at the last column.\n\n341\n00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.300\nIt just always does that, okay?\n\n342\n00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:43.120\nAnd so notice that this looks like it's\nadding up all the number of calls.\n\n343\n00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.660\nThat's exactly what it's doing.\n\n344\n00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:48.290\nIs that all it does is adding or\ndoes it do other mathematical operations?\n\n345\n00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:49.920\nThere are others, yes.\n\n346\n00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:54.560\nThat little drop down at the bottom Yeah,\n\n347\n00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:59.820\nyeah Because this is performing a specific\ncalculation or function, so if I wanted\n\n348\n00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:03.870\nto average this, and an average is\nif I wanted to count this, count.\n\n349\n00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:05.030\nIt's very nice.\nIt is, right?\n\n350\n00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.990\nCan you add multiple total rows,\nso if I wanted to add and\n\n351\n00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:09.840\nhave the average and do it.\n\n352\n00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:10.780\nCan you do that?\n\n353\n00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.930\nYou know, I don't think I've\never had anybody ask me that.\n\n354\n00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:16.665\nI'm a crazy person,\nwho thinks of crazy things, apparently.\n\n355\n00:17:16.665 --> 00:17:19.476\n[LAUGH] You know, I don't think so?\n\n356\n00:17:19.476 --> 00:17:22.770\nI mean, I can see it not being absolutely\nnecessary because you can just switch it\n\n357\n00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:23.986\nto whatever you want.\n\n358\n00:17:23.986 --> 00:17:27.500\nWell, okay, as soon as you said that,\nI'm like, what I would do\n\n359\n00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:32.650\nif I wanted one line to be averages and\none line to be subtotals Just make copies.\n\n360\n00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:33.620\nI would use subtotals.\n\n361\n00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:38.330\nI would use a separate functionality\nof Excel and that's actually a very,\n\n362\n00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:38.950\nkeep that in mind.\n\n363\n00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:42.237\nI'm going to lock that away for\njust a [CROSSTALK] Yeah, write that down,\n\n364\n00:17:42.237 --> 00:17:44.070\nbecause there's something down here.\n\n365\n00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:46.715\nSubtotals, with my fake pen.\n\n366\n00:17:46.715 --> 00:17:48.870\nSubtotal.\n[LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE] We're good.\n\n367\n00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:49.910\nBecause that's a really good thing.\n\n368\n00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:54.320\nAnd we've already done these subtotals\nepisodes, so if you haven't checked that\n\n369\n00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:57.890\nout, definitely do, it's in the groups\noutlinings, yeah, group and outlines.\n\n370\n00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:59.754\nOkay.\nIt's in one of those episodes,\n\n371\n00:17:59.754 --> 00:18:03.239\nI can't remember the name, [LAUGH] but\nit's really cool, I do love subtotals.\n\n372\n00:18:03.239 --> 00:18:05.185\nYou can't do subtotals on tables.\n\n373\n00:18:05.185 --> 00:18:07.250\nAh-ha.\nKeep that in mind, okay?\n\n374\n00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:10.770\nSo this would be, I'm going to say,\nwith another asterisk,\n\n375\n00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:12.690\nyou can only have one total bar.\n\n376\n00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:13.680\nOkay.\nOkay, within in a table.\n\n377\n00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:14.496\nAll right.\n\n378\n00:18:14.496 --> 00:18:18.480\nSo now you can perform different\ncalculations, now here, what about sales,\n\n379\n00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.760\nwhat if i want to add this here because,\nyeah, it went ahead and\n\n380\n00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.520\nadded it to that last column, but\nyou could add it to any of them.\n\n381\n00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:28.400\nIt's this special row that does\nthings like, for example this one.\n\n382\n00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.590\nI want to count.\n\n383\n00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:34.390\nLook at how many people have\nfilled out their form, nine.\n\n384\n00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:38.180\nMaybe I wanna see what the average\nsale is, here's my average.\n\n385\n00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:42.690\nOkay, cool, so I have a count,\nan average, and a sum.\n\n386\n00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:45.960\nBut look up here, now I know this\nis not a show about functions and\n\n387\n00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.160\nformulas we have a whole\nseparate series on this.\n\n388\n00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:52.560\nBut you see up in the formula bar that\nit is saying that there is a specific\n\n389\n00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.840\nfunction called sub-total.\n\n390\n00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:57.380\nThen there is a parenthesis that's 109 and\nthen calls.\n\n391\n00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:01.010\nWell calls is the name of\nthe column within that table.\n\n392\n00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:02.470\nWhat is this 109?\n\n393\n00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:03.960\nIt's spaced like a reference chart.\n\n394\n00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:07.290\nSo there is like a subset of functions for\n\n395\n00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:12.180\nsubtotals that has 109\nis going to be The sum.\n\n396\n00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:17.740\nIf I click on this one see this one\nis 101, and then this one is 103.\n\n397\n00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:22.520\nSo 101 is average, 103 is count,\n109 is adding, and so on and so forth.\n\n398\n00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:23.780\nSo that's what it's doing.\n\n399\n00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:27.160\nSo it's just our numerical reference\nnumber to those subtotal functions?\n\n400\n00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:27.660\nCorrect, yeah.\nOkay.\n\n401\n00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:31.020\nYou don't really have to know much about\nthem, besides I'm just pointing it out.\n\n402\n00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:34.030\nYou just turn on, you format as a table,\nyou turn on the total row,\n\n403\n00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:37.080\nyou click the little drop down at\nthe bottom of the column that you want,\n\n404\n00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.736\nyou choose the function and that's it.\n\n405\n00:19:38.736 --> 00:19:43.470\n[INAUDIBLE] But\nthe coolest part about this is, all right,\n\n406\n00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:48.570\nI want to see just\nthe advertising department.\n\n407\n00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:52.770\nI want to see all of their stuff, so\nwhen you start applying your filters, so\n\n408\n00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:55.840\nif I uncheck this, turn on advertising,\n\n409\n00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:01.770\ndo you see that it does all of the same\nstuff, but now within that filtered data?\n\n410\n00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:04.300\nSweet, so I could see really quickly\n\n411\n00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.800\nthat only one person advertising\nhas completed their form.\n\n412\n00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:10.660\nLet me turn off advertising and\nsee marketing.\n\n413\n00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:13.520\nOkay, well markings got three,\nthey're doing a little bit better.\n\n414\n00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:19.150\nSo you could see it;s a dynamic\nbased on the particular\n\n415\n00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:21.910\nfilters that you apply to the table.\n\n416\n00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:23.440\nSo pretty cool way and\n\n417\n00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:27.650\nkinda quick way to analyze your\ndata by just changing your filters.\n\n418\n00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:32.510\nAnd all the same things, you could do\nall of the greater than or less than,\n\n419\n00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:34.200\nall the things we talked\nabout in the sort and\n\n420\n00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.860\nfilters can all be applied\nhere within tables.\n\n421\n00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:40.580\nAnd that's why I just\nlove these total rows and\n\n422\n00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:46.370\nhow they change based on what\nI have within my filters.\n\n423\n00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:49.300\nReally, really cool and pretty neat.\n\n424\n00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.820\nAll right, so nice.\n\n425\n00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:54.380\nWe've got our styles,\nwe've got our options.\n\n426\n00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:58.360\nWe've got our total rows and\nhow it does all of our calculations.\n\n427\n00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.670\nThere's a few other neat\nthings that you can do.\n\n428\n00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:02.450\nThere is this slicer.\n\n429\n00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:07.406\nNow the slicer is really just a more\ngraphical representation of what I\n\n430\n00:21:07.406 --> 00:21:08.750\njust did, right?\n\n431\n00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:11.156\nI was saying I wanted\nto see the developers,\n\n432\n00:21:11.156 --> 00:21:13.770\nI wanted to see the sales, right?\n\n433\n00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:15.860\nYou can make that in button form,\nokay, and\n\n434\n00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:19.380\nthis becomes more of like you start\ngetting into those dashboards.\n\n435\n00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:22.340\nLike everybody wants to create these cool\ndashboards these interactive things.\n\n436\n00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:24.945\nWho doesn't love a dashboard,\nthey're amazing really.\n\n437\n00:21:24.945 --> 00:21:27.360\n[LAUGH] Especially the number of people,\nso.\n\n438\n00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.570\nThey're like They do love those things.\n\n439\n00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:29.630\nI know right?\n\n440\n00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:32.430\nI know all of our leadership team, they\njust like they want all these data and\n\n441\n00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:34.705\nthey wanna be able to see these charts and\neverything, and yeah.\n\n442\n00:21:34.705 --> 00:21:35.585\nLike a wizard.\n\n443\n00:21:35.585 --> 00:21:41.150\n[LAUGH] Yeah this is, I mean this\nis like basic wizardry right now,\n\n444\n00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:45.260\nbut a slicer is just saying\nthat I want to put in\n\n445\n00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:50.620\na graphical button filter\nof one of my columns.\n\n446\n00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.550\nSo see we have first last department.\n\n447\n00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:58.600\nLet's just use department, and\nclick OK, and then there it is.\n\n448\n00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:59.480\nIt's just buttons.\n\n449\n00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:03.520\nSo if I wanted to say let's go ahead and\nsee sales, you click on Sales.\n\n450\n00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.630\nAnd says, hey, I wanna be a developer.\n\n451\n00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:11.380\nOkay, well do you want to be\nable to choose and clear it out.\n\n452\n00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:12.110\nThat right there.\n\n453\n00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:14.720\nThis little button is where\nyou can have multiples, right?\n\n454\n00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.930\nBecause if I wanted to see developer and\nmarking.\n\n455\n00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:20.240\nActually I just turned those off and\ndid the opposite.\n\n456\n00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.880\nI just did advertising sales.\n\n457\n00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.070\nBut you could see turn them on,\nturn them off.\n\n458\n00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.940\nAnd that's it.\nAnd\n\n459\n00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:28.540\nthen you can add other slicers\nin here if you wanted too.\n\n460\n00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:31.950\nSo I could go ahead and\nthen come back into here,\n\n461\n00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:37.352\nanswer another slicer for\nlet's say last name.\n\n462\n00:22:37.352 --> 00:22:39.165\nThat might be one that's\na little bit too much,\n\n463\n00:22:39.165 --> 00:22:40.400\nbecause now we have lots of last names.\n\n464\n00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.120\nYeah, you do.\n\n465\n00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.580\nYeah, so\nyou can see that I could just turn on and\n\n466\n00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:48.320\nsee Tell me how many people I'm\nadvertising with the last name of cats.\n\n467\n00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:52.170\nSo same thing as these drop downs,\nthey're just in button forms.\n\n468\n00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:54.520\nThat's really what a slicer does,\npretty cute.\n\n469\n00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:55.670\nIt's actually pretty cool, yeah.\n\n470\n00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:59.280\nI can see now this is what the,\nthose lovely dashboards do for you.\n\n471\n00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.760\nNow I can understand the draw and\nthe appeal.\n\n472\n00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:05.560\nAnd especially if this is\na large amount of data.\n\n473\n00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:09.160\nTo click a button makes\nlife a whole lot easier.\n\n474\n00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:12.290\n[LAUGH] If you had 50 columns,\nand 60,000 rows.\n\n475\n00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:14.110\nA database.\n\n476\n00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:14.950\nYeah, 60,000 things.\n\n477\n00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:16.140\nDefinitely.\n\n478\n00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:22.030\nSo you can see why these little\nbuttons can be very handy.\n\n479\n00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:25.290\nAnd if you don't like them you\njust delete it just like-Ooh, woo!\n\n480\n00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:26.960\nSorry, I'm just going crazy over here.\n\n481\n00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.220\nOkay, let's stop.\n\n482\n00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:28.865\nHit delete.\n\n483\n00:23:28.865 --> 00:23:31.950\n[LAUGH] All I did was just hit\nthe delete key on my keyboard.\n\n484\n00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:33.900\nLet me move back over here.\n\n485\n00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:35.630\nAnd so it's just taking it away.\n\n486\n00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:39.188\nYou're not changing anything through data,\n\n487\n00:23:39.188 --> 00:23:43.939\nit's just a button to filter\nyour stuff out, so pretty cool.\n\n488\n00:23:43.939 --> 00:23:45.929\nLove all of these things about tables.\n\n489\n00:23:45.929 --> 00:23:49.446\nThere's a couple of other\nthings that's neat about them.\n\n490\n00:23:49.446 --> 00:23:52.432\nNow the next I'm going to show\nyou is this remove duplicates.\n\n491\n00:23:52.432 --> 00:23:55.077\nThis is not reserved for tables.\n\n492\n00:23:55.077 --> 00:23:58.910\nOkay, remove duplicates by itself\nis just it's own little function.\n\n493\n00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:00.240\nIt's nationwide.\n\n494\n00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.360\nYeah, it is not table specific.\n\n495\n00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:02.950\nGotcha.\n\n496\n00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:07.387\nBut they put it in that contextual tab of\ntables cuz it's kinda neat to be able to\n\n497\n00:24:07.387 --> 00:24:08.611\ndo things like this.\n\n498\n00:24:08.611 --> 00:24:11.410\nSo what's this remove duplicate mean?\n\n499\n00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:12.480\nWhat do you think it's gonna do?\n\n500\n00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.482\nI think it's going to save the whales.\n\n501\n00:24:15.482 --> 00:24:19.300\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] Obviously it finds\nduplicates and removes them.\n\n502\n00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:20.230\nYes, exactly.\n\n503\n00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:24.620\nAnd I went ahead and took this particular\nworksheet and I changed the text so\n\n504\n00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:27.010\nwe could see that, yes, this is working.\n\n505\n00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:31.481\nNotice I have three\nexact rows of Sasha Cat.\n\n506\n00:24:31.481 --> 00:24:34.350\nAnd then I have Kimba and\nthen I have Tootsie.\n\n507\n00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:36.880\nWhy would this be important?\n\n508\n00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.400\nMaybe you're doing a mailing list.\n\n509\n00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:42.935\nYou don't wanna mail Sasha Cat three\ndifferent pieces of the same mail.\n\n510\n00:24:42.935 --> 00:24:46.360\nSo you wanna remove the duplicates but\ndo be careful.\n\n511\n00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:49.490\nNotice on this one,\nhere's Tootsie Paws but\n\n512\n00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:52.570\nit only duplicates in these three columns.\n\n513\n00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:56.957\nThe address and the city and\nthe state, those are different, okay?\n\n514\n00:24:56.957 --> 00:25:04.144\nSo you can choose what criteria or\ncolumns that need to match for\n\n515\n00:25:04.144 --> 00:25:09.030\nwhat is considered a duplicate entry.\n\n516\n00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:13.580\nSo this could be considered a duplicate\nentry if I am only choosing, hey,\n\n517\n00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:18.090\nif there is duplicates in both\nthe first and the last, then remove it.\n\n518\n00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:23.028\nOr do you want every single column to\nbecome the criteria of what becomes\n\n519\n00:25:23.028 --> 00:25:24.438\na duplicate value.\n\n520\n00:25:24.438 --> 00:25:27.390\nSo that's just something to notice.\n\n521\n00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:32.020\nAnd that's why I color coded\nthem a little bit differently.\n\n522\n00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:34.000\nLet's go ahead and formatted the table.\n\n523\n00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.488\nFirst, just for fun, let's go with pink.\n\n524\n00:25:36.488 --> 00:25:38.580\nYeah, and there we go.\n\n525\n00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:41.672\nOkay, it did keep that local\nformatting of the text,\n\n526\n00:25:41.672 --> 00:25:43.948\nso that you know what's going on here.\n\n527\n00:25:43.948 --> 00:25:47.843\nAnd then we've got right over here,\nagain on the Table,\n\n528\n00:25:47.843 --> 00:25:50.372\nRemove Duplicates, we click on it.\n\n529\n00:25:50.372 --> 00:25:52.640\nAnd notice it selects everything.\n\n530\n00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.781\nAnd then it says, okay hey,\n\n531\n00:25:54.781 --> 00:25:58.807\nwhat do you want to match to\nmake it a duplicate value?\n\n532\n00:25:58.807 --> 00:26:01.160\nNotice they're all selected right now,\nokay?\n\n533\n00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.693\nSo if I click OK,\nit's gonna go say and say,\n\n534\n00:26:04.693 --> 00:26:08.799\nhey I went ahead and\nfound four duplicate values and\n\n535\n00:26:08.799 --> 00:26:13.980\nremove them and\nI now have 22 remaining that are unique.\n\n536\n00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:18.500\nAnd there is now only one\ninstance of that Sasha Cat.\n\n537\n00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.010\nThese stayed.\n\n538\n00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:21.121\nAnd why?\n\n539\n00:26:21.121 --> 00:26:23.361\nBecause these are not duplicate.\n\n540\n00:26:23.361 --> 00:26:27.120\nRight. Okay? So that way Tootsie Paws- So\nyou set the criteria for everything.\n\n541\n00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.257\nExactly.\nIt said, hey, well,\n\n542\n00:26:28.257 --> 00:26:30.070\nthese aren't the exact same thing.\n\n543\n00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.625\nSo there you go.\n\n544\n00:26:30.625 --> 00:26:33.300\nAnd there's different scenarios\nas to why you want to do it.\n\n545\n00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:38.260\nOne I would always have to do for example\nwhen we would have total enrollment.\n\n546\n00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:43.564\nTotal enrollment within the classes\nthat we were offering at the university.\n\n547\n00:26:43.564 --> 00:26:44.122\nRight.\n\n548\n00:26:44.122 --> 00:26:48.213\nOkay, that's great.\nWell, notice right here Jack Bowtie,\n\n549\n00:26:48.213 --> 00:26:54.050\nJack Bowtie is one student but\nhe has three enrollments.\n\n550\n00:26:54.050 --> 00:27:00.670\nSo this is where, okay, if I wanted\nto determine what was our enrollment,\n\n551\n00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:06.730\nfor let's say, the semester, I could\neasily just format as a table, all right?\n\n552\n00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:08.792\nAnd don't worry, you don't\nnecessarily need to read the text.\n\n553\n00:27:08.792 --> 00:27:09.447\nClick OK.\nAnd\n\n554\n00:27:09.447 --> 00:27:12.459\nthen the easiest way would\nbe just add a Total row.\n\n555\n00:27:12.459 --> 00:27:13.910\nAnd then there you go.\n\n556\n00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:15.310\nIt totaled up that there.\n\n557\n00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:18.250\nThis is actually not necessarily a sum.\n\n558\n00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:19.359\nIt saw this- It counts, yeah.\n\n559\n00:27:19.359 --> 00:27:22.580\nYes, cuz it saw that\nthe last column was text.\n\n560\n00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:23.310\nSo it didn't do a sum.\n\n561\n00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:25.170\nRight.\nSo it is pretty smart that way.\n\n562\n00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:25.960\nIt is pretty smart.\n\n563\n00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:29.465\nSo it's like, yeah, I have 26 enrollments.\n\n564\n00:27:29.465 --> 00:27:33.252\nBut that's not the same as how many\nstudents do I have enrolled in this\n\n565\n00:27:33.252 --> 00:27:35.031\nparticular semester, right?\n\n566\n00:27:35.031 --> 00:27:37.770\nCuz remember, Jack has three- Right.\n\n567\n00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:39.750\nSasha has three.\n\n568\n00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:41.354\nThat's not the same, is it?\n\n569\n00:27:41.354 --> 00:27:42.805\nRight, it's the same person,\n\n570\n00:27:42.805 --> 00:27:46.620\nyou're counting them multiple times\nbecause of what you're asking it to do.\n\n571\n00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:49.790\nExactly, yeah,\nenrollments versus students enrolled.\n\n572\n00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:52.766\nStudents, right.\nSo that's where I would go ahead and\n\n573\n00:27:52.766 --> 00:27:58.840\ndo the Remove duplicates and say I want\ntheir first and last but not their course.\n\n574\n00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:02.948\nSo yes, Jack Bowtie,\nI only need one Jack Bowtie.\n\n575\n00:28:02.948 --> 00:28:06.910\nThat's where you're gonna be kind\nof careful with your data too.\n\n576\n00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:11.302\nYou probably want like another parameter,\nespecially if you had Jack Smith.\n\n577\n00:28:11.302 --> 00:28:11.832\nRight.\n\n578\n00:28:11.832 --> 00:28:13.140\nHow many Jack Smiths are there?\n\n579\n00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:14.330\nYeah, if you got three Jack Smith,\n\n580\n00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:16.300\nyou wanna count for\neach one of those Jack Smiths.\n\n581\n00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:18.953\nYeah.\nSo you gotta be careful- This can get\n\n582\n00:28:18.953 --> 00:28:20.046\na little convoluted.\n\n583\n00:28:20.046 --> 00:28:21.580\n[LAUGH] Yes, know your data.\n\n584\n00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:22.320\nRight.\nRight?\n\n585\n00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:25.930\nYou probably wanna have there-\nNo initial or something.\n\n586\n00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:27.980\nYou see, that might even be the same.\n\n587\n00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:29.350\nOr their student ID.\n\n588\n00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:31.050\nYeah.\nBecause that's unique.\n\n589\n00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:36.960\nWhen I was in school, I had a big argument\nwith a guy from placement services.\n\n590\n00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.220\nCuz he was like,\nwe need your social security.\n\n591\n00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:38.933\nAnd I'm like, don't we have a student ID?\n\n592\n00:28:38.933 --> 00:28:40.750\nAnd they were like, well yeah.\n\n593\n00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:42.121\nI go, well, why don't you just use that?\n\n594\n00:28:42.121 --> 00:28:44.200\nAnd everyone's student ID is different.\n\n595\n00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.460\nJust use that.\n\n596\n00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:49.067\nListen to me, he's like, if you don't\nwant my help- [LAUGH] I'm not saying,\n\n597\n00:28:49.067 --> 00:28:50.030\nI'm just wondering.\n\n598\n00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:50.802\nIt's how I think.\n\n599\n00:28:50.802 --> 00:28:56.860\nYou have unique data, you already have it,\nyou don't need another.\n\n600\n00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:59.961\nProbably, but it's probably the way their\nsystem is set up that that's the only way\n\n601\n00:28:59.961 --> 00:29:01.674\nthat they can filter it,\nbut I do understand.\n\n602\n00:29:01.674 --> 00:29:03.138\nRight, I just didn't- And\n\n603\n00:29:03.138 --> 00:29:06.683\nthat's why a lot of universities went\naway from using your social security.\n\n604\n00:29:06.683 --> 00:29:07.830\nYeah, through the student ID.\n\n605\n00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:10.760\nExactly, cause like security and\nall that kind of stuff, so\n\n606\n00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:12.719\nyou don't want to give out your social.\n\n607\n00:29:12.719 --> 00:29:14.797\nI was in a tech school, by the way.\n\n608\n00:29:14.797 --> 00:29:15.380\n[LAUGH].\n\n609\n00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:16.610\n[LAUGH] So shame shame.\n\n610\n00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:19.158\nYeah, but if they're working on some\nlegacy database that that's their only\n\n611\n00:29:19.158 --> 00:29:19.942\nthing that's theirs.\n\n612\n00:29:19.942 --> 00:29:23.317\nYeah, this was 2001 It was a while back.\n\n613\n00:29:23.317 --> 00:29:25.315\nYeah.\n\n614\n00:29:25.315 --> 00:29:27.540\n[LAUGH] But yes, knowing your data,\n\n615\n00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:30.300\nunderstanding that this will do\nexactly what I'm telling it to.\n\n616\n00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:34.890\nIf there are duplicate first and last\nnames, I will take all of them out, and\n\n617\n00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:36.300\nit removed all my duplicates.\n\n618\n00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:44.000\nSo I actually have 15 students enrolled,\nbut 26 enrollments.\n\n619\n00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.250\nSo just something to think about when\nyou're doing the remove duplicates,\n\n620\n00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:49.020\npretty cool.\n\n621\n00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:51.589\nNow coming back full circle,\nremember that thing that you wrote down?\n\n622\n00:29:51.589 --> 00:29:52.948\nSub-totals.\n\n623\n00:29:52.948 --> 00:29:53.781\nYes, [LAUGH].\n\n624\n00:29:53.781 --> 00:29:57.086\nSub-totals in my invisible ink right here.\n\n625\n00:29:57.086 --> 00:30:02.410\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] Yes, so that's something\nthat I said you cannot do as a table.\n\n626\n00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:07.140\nThere are certain things\nthat will not allow you to\n\n627\n00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:10.740\nbe performed if it's formatted as a table,\nright?\n\n628\n00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:15.430\nSo for example,\nif I went to my Data tab and\n\n629\n00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:18.110\nI went into the Subtotals,\nnotice it's grayed out, okay.\n\n630\n00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:21.020\nBecause this is a special range.\n\n631\n00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:25.710\nThis is a special thing\nthat is formatted in Excel.\n\n632\n00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:30.340\nSo there are going to be reasons\nwhy you'd want to do this.\n\n633\n00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:32.470\nConvert it to a range.\n\n634\n00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:35.640\nTake this special table formatting, and\n\n635\n00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:40.850\njust go right back out to just\nnormal regular cells, okay?\n\n636\n00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:45.310\nSo if I click on this, Are you sure you\nwant to convert it to a normal range?\n\n637\n00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:46.167\nYes, you click that.\n\n638\n00:30:46.167 --> 00:30:48.365\nThe formatting stays the same, right.\n\n639\n00:30:48.365 --> 00:30:51.170\nAll your little drop-downs go away.\n\n640\n00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:55.860\nThis becomes like this other new kind of\nlike it's still a subtotal cuz subtotals\n\n641\n00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:57.490\nare actual functions.\n\n642\n00:30:57.490 --> 00:30:59.770\nBut now I don't have the drop-downs or\nanything like that.\n\n643\n00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:04.055\nBut a command such as\nsubtotals is available to me.\n\n644\n00:31:04.055 --> 00:31:04.880\nRight.\nAll right, so\n\n645\n00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.420\nthat's just something you\nneed to be careful about and\n\n646\n00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:11.020\nthere's plenty of reasons why I wanna\nconvert it to a normal range sometimes.\n\n647\n00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:14.340\nDoing subtotals is one of them, okay?\n\n648\n00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:19.269\nAnd so now,\nmy whole insert to insert a column row or\n\n649\n00:31:19.269 --> 00:31:23.754\na column or table row,\ntable column, right?\n\n650\n00:31:23.754 --> 00:31:26.200\n[LAUGH] Don't look at me.\n\n651\n00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:29.265\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] She's staring\nat me like I got the answer.\n\n652\n00:31:29.265 --> 00:31:31.581\n[LAUGH] The stuff that\nI was doing over here.\n\n653\n00:31:31.581 --> 00:31:35.787\n[LAUGH] When we were going into the\ninsert, the table columns and table rows,\n\n654\n00:31:35.787 --> 00:31:39.970\nthat doesn't exist anymore\nbecause it's not a table, okay?\n\n655\n00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:42.585\nA few other things that I actually\nkinda forgot, now that I realize and\n\n656\n00:31:42.585 --> 00:31:43.573\nI'm looking at the time.\n\n657\n00:31:43.573 --> 00:31:44.839\nYou're like, hey, let's go.\n\n658\n00:31:44.839 --> 00:31:48.355\nBut the whole inserting a row,\ninserting a column within the table,\n\n659\n00:31:48.355 --> 00:31:49.998\nthe other thing that you can do.\n\n660\n00:31:49.998 --> 00:31:52.505\nDo you see this little\ntriangle-y thing right here?\n\n661\n00:31:52.505 --> 00:31:57.767\nIf I was coming to the end of my table and\nI wanted to just keep on typing.\n\n662\n00:31:57.767 --> 00:32:01.450\nJust like if I was in a table in Word,\nyou just hit the Tab key.\n\n663\n00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:03.000\nAnd do you notice that it [SOUND].\n\n664\n00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:03.519\nYeah.\nIt\n\n665\n00:32:03.519 --> 00:32:06.900\njust went right back to the beginning and\nthen I just go ahead and do my stuff.\n\n666\n00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:08.171\nAnd then keep on tabbing.\n\n667\n00:32:08.171 --> 00:32:10.210\nYou see that triangle right down here.\n\n668\n00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:12.060\nJust keeps on extending.\n\n669\n00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:15.350\nSo you could do that,\nit should just automatically add or- Or\n\n670\n00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:18.320\npush that next table below it\ndown if you keep going too far?\n\n671\n00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:20.240\nWell, if you keep on going, see down here.\n\n672\n00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.560\nI could go ahead and if I go into here.\n\n673\n00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:27.008\nThat's where it's gonna be like [SOUND],\nnope, overlapping, can't understand it.\n\n674\n00:32:27.008 --> 00:32:30.220\nSo that's where I would\nneed to come into here.\n\n675\n00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:34.590\nInsert regular rows,\nprobably go ahead and push them down.\n\n676\n00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:36.110\nAnd then keep on adding.\n\n677\n00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:38.620\nGot you.\nOkay, nut this is your barrier.\n\n678\n00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:40.290\nOr you boundary of your tables, so\n\n679\n00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:45.500\nif I wanted to say, I don't want these\nguys to be considered into my table.\n\n680\n00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:49.240\nYou can change it there and\nthen get rid of all this or whatever, but\n\n681\n00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:51.150\nthese become normal cells.\n\n682\n00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:54.850\nThese are table cells, you want to\ninclude them, you can just drag it down.\n\n683\n00:32:54.850 --> 00:32:58.506\nSo you can change\nthe boundary of your tables.\n\n684\n00:32:58.506 --> 00:33:01.288\nAnd sometimes people want to go ahead and\njust make a whole bunch of blank rows.\n\n685\n00:33:01.288 --> 00:33:03.710\nBecause they are going\nto keep adding stuff in.\n\n686\n00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:04.740\nTotally fine there.\n\n687\n00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:08.000\nThe other thing is,\nthat if I'm back over here.\n\n688\n00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.650\nLet's go ahead and\nform this back at a table really quickly.\n\n689\n00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:13.620\nSorry, I just remembered this and\nI'm like, I didn't show them that.\n\n690\n00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:15.320\nOkay, so if I take this.\n\n691\n00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:15.950\nThere's perfect.\n\n692\n00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:20.990\nIf I'm over here, normal cell and\nI start typing in dog.\n\n693\n00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:22.723\nDogs?\n\n694\n00:33:22.723 --> 00:33:23.838\nI like dogs, but\n\n695\n00:33:23.838 --> 00:33:28.990\nyou see how automatically it includes\nit [SOUND] as a column to my table.\n\n696\n00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:33.887\nSo if you start typing next to it\nit automatically adds right here.\n\n697\n00:33:33.887 --> 00:33:37.280\nAnd then it will go ahead and add, but now\nit's actually adding after a total row.\n\n698\n00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.030\nI've kinda gotten this\na little bit jacked up so.\n\n699\n00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:43.452\nYeah [CROSSTALK] you've gotta be a little\nmindful of how you situate these things.\n\n700\n00:33:43.452 --> 00:33:45.538\nAnd I had already converted\nit back to a range and\n\n701\n00:33:45.538 --> 00:33:47.270\nyoo probably wouldn't wanna do that.\n\n702\n00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:52.640\nYou'd probably wanna take the total\nrow off before you convert to a range.\n\n703\n00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.590\nBut I just wanted to kinda point that\nout because it can be a little weird.\n\n704\n00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:57.720\nAnd I've had people be like,\nwhy does it keep adding into it?\n\n705\n00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.450\nI'm like, no, it thinks it's a table.\n\n706\n00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:02.000\nIf you don't want it to be a table,\njust tell it no.\n\n707\n00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.860\nI want dogs to be separate and\nnot part of the table.\n\n708\n00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:10.510\nChange the boundaries to include\nwhat you want or do not want.\n\n709\n00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:13.610\nAs rows or columns within your table.\n\n710\n00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:16.690\nChange it like that and\nyou'll be good to go.\n\n711\n00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:17.260\nAll right, Vonne.\n\n712\n00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:19.880\nGreat information about\ntables inside of Excel.\n\n713\n00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:22.350\nVery good stuff and\nnot just your barebones stuff.\n\n714\n00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:27.220\nBut some of the higher echelons of\nworking with tables inside of Excel.\n\n715\n00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:30.499\nWe do have you to thank for that and I as\nalways We're going to do that right now.\n\n716\n00:34:30.499 --> 00:34:31.374\nThank you, Vaughn.\n\n717\n00:34:31.374 --> 00:34:32.394\nThank you.\nGood stuff,\n\n718\n00:34:32.394 -->

[LAUGH] Are you referring to\n\n12\n00:00:39.953 --> 00:00:42.857\nthe episode right before this,\nwhen we were talking about tables?\n\n13\n00:00:42.857 --> 00:00:44.735\n&gt;&gt; I feel like we've done this.\n\n14\n00:00:44.735 --> 00:00:45.381\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n15\n00:00:45.381 --> 00:00:46.753\n&gt;&gt; And there was data in those tables,\n\n16\n00:00:46.753 --> 00:00:49.356\ncorrect me if I'm wrong.\n&gt;&gt; You are very much correct.\n\n17\n00:00:49.356 --> 00:00:49.922\n&gt;&gt; See?\n\n18\n00:00:49.922 --> 00:00:52.451\n&gt;&gt; But they're nothing like each other\n\n19\n00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:54.761\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; So, it's a different thing,\n\n20\n00:00:54.761 --> 00:00:57.331\nhence the different nomenclature.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes [LAUGH].\n\n21\n00:00:57.331 --> 00:00:58.666\n&gt;&gt; How about that?\n\n22\n00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:01.043\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and actually, data tables has\n\n23\n00:01:01.043 --> 00:01:04.559\nbeen around for actually, awhile.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n24\n00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.523\n&gt;&gt; And it's not necessarily a total new\n\n25\n00:01:07.523 --> 00:01:08.196\nthing.\n\n26\n00:01:08.196 --> 00:01:13.902\nAnd tables, tables are in the context\nof the life span of excel,\n\n27\n00:01:13.902 --> 00:01:16.556\nbut they are newer in a sense.\n\n28\n00:01:16.556 --> 00:01:18.126\nI think, they came around in 2007?\n\n29\n00:01:18.126 --> 00:01:20.321\nOffice 2007?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n30\n00:01:20.321 --> 00:01:21.034\n&gt;&gt; You know.\n\n31\n00:01:21.034 --> 00:01:22.015\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that is newish.\n\n32\n00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:23.602\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH], well since you have,\n\n33\n00:01:23.602 --> 00:01:26.565\nyou know, Office 2000 and\neverything like that, so like.\n\n34\n00:01:26.565 --> 00:01:28.515\n&gt;&gt; We're getting into our newology now,\n\n35\n00:01:28.515 --> 00:01:29.329\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n36\n00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:30.091\n&gt;&gt; The study of new.\n\n37\n00:01:30.091 --> 00:01:32.113\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right, you know, like,\n\n38\n00:01:32.113 --> 00:01:35.383\nwhat is new in the relative\ntime space continuum and.\n\n39\n00:01:35.383 --> 00:01:37.100\n&gt;&gt; It's getting heavy in here.\n\n40\n00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.951\n&gt;&gt; It is [LAUGH], yeah, right.\n\n41\n00:01:38.951 --> 00:01:41.486\nSo, why don't we go into,\nlike, what is a data table.\n\n42\n00:01:41.486 --> 00:01:45.709\nSo, this is going to solely depend\non anything with calculations.\n\n43\n00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:49.513\nSo, you're going to have,\nto have some formulas of functions.\n\n44\n00:01:49.513 --> 00:01:54.161\nPerformed on some data,\nthat you want to perform some\n\n45\n00:01:54.161 --> 00:01:56.932\nwhat if analysis.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n46\n00:01:56.932 --> 00:01:58.106\n&gt;&gt; We do this all the time, you know.\n\n47\n00:01:58.106 --> 00:02:02.382\nWhat if we increase our production?\n\n48\n00:02:02.382 --> 00:02:05.675\nHow many more Christmas\nmice can we make if we\n\n49\n00:02:05.675 --> 00:02:10.669\ndo a 24-hour production clock\nrather than a 12-hour shift?\n\n50\n00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:11.933\nYou know, those types of things.\n\n51\n00:02:11.933 --> 00:02:14.947\nOr what if we got our labor cost down?\n\n52\n00:02:14.947 --> 00:02:15.818\nOr our materials cost down?\n\n53\n00:02:15.818 --> 00:02:18.321\nHow would that affect our bottom line?\n\n54\n00:02:18.321 --> 00:02:21.774\nYou know, these are things that you talk\nabout when you're doing data analysis all\n\n55\n00:02:21.774 --> 00:02:22.575\nday long, right?\n\n56\n00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:26.013\nI mean, we hear about them talking about\nit all day long with Tim and Barry and\n\n57\n00:02:26.013 --> 00:02:27.070\neverybody else.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n58\n00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.738\n&gt;&gt; And we're just like,\n\n59\n00:02:27.738 --> 00:02:29.154\nwe're just kinda here and\nfilm some episodes.\n\n60\n00:02:29.154 --> 00:02:32.360\n[LAUGH] so yeah, you guys do that\nnumber crunching over there.\n\n61\n00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.507\n&gt;&gt; Crazy over there [LAUGH].\n\n62\n00:02:33.507 --> 00:02:34.632\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But those are different things.\n\n63\n00:02:34.632 --> 00:02:39.215\nThere's a specific variable that, hey,\nif we change this variable a little bit,\n\n64\n00:02:39.215 --> 00:02:41.324\nit's gonna change everything else.\n\n65\n00:02:41.324 --> 00:02:44.304\nAnd that's what we're going\nto be doing with data tables.\n\n66\n00:02:44.304 --> 00:02:48.436\nWe're making a table with,\nI wanna say the word scenarios.\n\n67\n00:02:48.436 --> 00:02:53.038\nBut I wanna avoid that because that's\nactually another type of what if\n\n68\n00:02:53.038 --> 00:02:56.084\nanalysis that's in\nthe drop down as a choice.\n\n69\n00:02:56.084 --> 00:02:58.805\nIt's kinda hard because you start running\nout of words that I can use to describe\n\n70\n00:02:58.805 --> 00:03:01.133\nthis.\n&gt;&gt; Use the thesaurus.\n\n71\n00:03:01.133 --> 00:03:02.827\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH], right that.\n\n72\n00:03:02.827 --> 00:03:04.089\n&gt;&gt; Thesaurus.com scenario.\n\n73\n00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:06.262\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and I don't wanna say.\n\n74\n00:03:06.262 --> 00:03:07.494\n&gt;&gt; Happenstance [LAUGH]\n\n75\n00:03:07.494 --> 00:03:08.938\n&gt;&gt; That table's function cuz then,\n\n76\n00:03:08.938 --> 00:03:11.700\na function's something different in Excel.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I hate that,\n\n77\n00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.240\nespecially in programming,\nyou wanna talk about functions.\n\n78\n00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.042\nBut then you create functions and\nthen that gets a little weird.\n\n79\n00:03:17.042 --> 00:03:21.295\nAnd that's why, I think a lot of different\nprogram leaders use words like method or\n\n80\n00:03:21.295 --> 00:03:23.175\nwhatever to differentiate.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n81\n00:03:23.175 --> 00:03:25.741\nit's like words that are associated\nwithin that particular program.\n\n82\n00:03:25.741 --> 00:03:28.442\nSo yeah,\nI'm doing the same thing right now.\n\n83\n00:03:28.442 --> 00:03:31.377\nSo, why don't we do some examples first?\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good to me.\n\n84\n00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:32.217\n&gt;&gt; Finished examples, and\n\n85\n00:03:32.217 --> 00:03:35.090\nthen I'll show you how to create\n&gt;&gt; Show me what you're talking about\n\n86\n00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.574\nVonne.\n&gt;&gt;

Yes, we'll never like watching\n\n136\n00:05:49.676 --> 00:05:52.866\nThe Sopranos before doing a show again.\n&gt;&gt; I know [LAUGH].\n\n137\n00:05:52.866 --> 00:05:54.386\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We're bad.\n\n138\n00:05:54.386 --> 00:05:56.430\n&gt;&gt; We're scary when we get together\n\n139\n00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.944\n[LAUGH].\n\n140\n00:05:56.944 --> 00:05:58.782\nSo we're taking this,\nand this is my variable.\n\n141\n00:05:58.782 --> 00:06:03.402\nAnd this is just saying,\nwell if I did it at $10,000,\n\n142\n00:06:03.402 --> 00:06:07.400\nthen my,\nmy cost per toy might get down to 2.25.\n\n143\n00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.324\nIf I increase it,\nwell then I can go up to 3.15.\n\n144\n00:06:10.324 --> 00:06:13.855\nBut then we're gonna do a super markup,\nand we can charge $6.\n\n145\n00:06:13.855 --> 00:06:15.837\nYou know, all that kind of stuff.\n\n146\n00:06:15.837 --> 00:06:21.135\nSo, this is a table, it's not formatted\nas a table, like our last episode.\n\n147\n00:06:21.135 --> 00:06:27.226\nIt's just a column and\nrow type of information that is performing\n\n148\n00:06:27.226 --> 00:06:32.332\nthese variable calculations,\nbased on these cells.\n\n149\n00:06:32.332 --> 00:06:34.339\nOkay, pretty cool.\n\n150\n00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:38.748\nNow, with the data tables you\ncan have up to two variables.\n\n151\n00:06:38.748 --> 00:06:41.890\nYou can't have more than that,\nso this is single variable data?\n\n152\n00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:42.807\nTater?\n&gt;&gt; Tater.\n\n153\n00:06:42.807 --> 00:06:44.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Tater tots?\n\n154\n00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.319\n&gt;&gt; I like taters, yeah, they're nice.\n\n155\n00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:47.398\n&gt;&gt; I like taters too, maybe I'll\n\n156\n00:06:47.398 --> 00:06:49.543\nhave some for dinner tonight, so.\n&gt;&gt; Change the ingredients,\n\n157\n00:06:49.543 --> 00:06:52.290\nand I have a little mouse here [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Right [LAUGH], there's our variable.\n\n158\n00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:52.999\n&gt;&gt; He's got taters.\n\n159\n00:06:52.999 --> 00:06:54.755\n&gt;&gt; Which restaurant am I going to go to\n\n160\n00:06:54.755 --> 00:06:55.669\nto get my taters?\n\n161\n00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:58.460\nAll right, so you can see,\nthis is just one variable, right?\n\n162\n00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:03.271\nWe have this, but what if we did,\nlike a two variable table?\n\n163\n00:07:03.271 --> 00:07:05.006\nAgain, just rows and columns, right?\n\n164\n00:07:05.006 --> 00:07:12.121\nAnd I've seen these in department stores,\nwhere you have different prices.\n\n165\n00:07:12.121 --> 00:07:17.026\nThis is how much of your percentage that\nwe're going to give you as your 50% off.\n\n166\n00:07:17.026 --> 00:07:17.894\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n167\n00:07:17.894 --> 00:07:19.459\n&gt;&gt; These are your prices, so\n\n168\n00:07:19.459 --> 00:07:20.461\nyou would save.\n\n169\n00:07:20.461 --> 00:07:24.099\nIf you were having a $25\nitem with 40% off,\n\n170\n00:07:24.099 --> 00:07:27.967\nthat will be saving $10, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n171\n00:07:27.967 --> 00:07:30.093\n&gt;&gt; But I don't know how much shopping\n\n172\n00:07:30.093 --> 00:07:33.181\nyou do there, Daniel, but\nI see you all the time.\n\n173\n00:07:33.181 --> 00:07:34.006\n&gt;&gt; I shop from time to\n\n174\n00:07:34.006 --> 00:07:34.731\ntime.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n175\n00:07:34.731 --> 00:07:35.699\nOnline.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n176\n00:07:35.699 --> 00:07:36.490\n&gt;&gt; Great [LAUGH]\n\n177\n00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:37.655\n&gt;&gt; Buy now [LAUGH].\n\n178\n00:07:37.655 --> 00:07:40.972\n&gt;&gt; So this is just taking, all right, so\n\n179\n00:07:40.972 --> 00:07:46.273\nthis particular cell right here,\nit's just C4 times C5.\n\n180\n00:07:46.273 --> 00:07:53.716\nSo C4, $5,000, times 10%,\ngives you $500, right?\n\n181\n00:07:53.716 --> 00:07:57.925\nSo, based off of this particular function,\nor in this case a formula,\n\n182\n00:07:57.925 --> 00:08:00.673\ncuz it doesn't have\nan actual main function.\n\n183\n00:08:00.673 --> 00:08:03.673\nIt's creating this data table, okay?\n\n184\n00:08:03.673 --> 00:08:08.626\nChange this variable, meaning\nthe discount, change this variable,\n\n185\n00:08:08.626 --> 00:08:13.000\nmeaning the price, and\nthen it gives me that cross reference,\n\n186\n00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.894\nyou used that in the other episode too,\ncross reference that, okay?\n\n187\n00:08:17.894 --> 00:08:19.330\n$40 with 50% off is $20.\n\n188\n00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:20.180\nCool, all right.\n\n189\n00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:23.983\nSo that's your two variable data table.\n\n190\n00:08:23.983 --> 00:08:25.924\nYou can do the same thing\nwith loan amounts, right?\n\n191\n00:08:25.924 --> 00:08:29.891\nIt's just the same idea of,\nwe're doing a specific function,\n\n192\n00:08:29.891 --> 00:08:35.363\nchanging our two variables, making a table\nout Same thing here, do a calculation.\n\n193\n00:08:35.363 --> 00:08:37.523\nGo ahead and create your tables.\n\n194\n00:08:37.523 --> 00:08:41.303\nSo there's a whole number of\nways that you can do this, but\n\n195\n00:08:41.303 --> 00:08:46.706\nagain it does come down to knowing your\ndata, what two variables you wanna change.\n\n196\n00:08:46.706 --> 00:08:51.725\nAnd then sometimes depending on the\ncomplexity of your particular formula or\n\n197\n00:08:51.725 --> 00:08:55.430\nfunction Yeah,\nyou could change these two things, but\n\n198\n00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:58.340\nthen you could also change\nsomething else within it, and\n\n199\n00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:02.780\nthen it changes all your numbers too.\n&gt;&gt; So in a regular table, we have data\n\n200\n00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:08.510\nthat is put in by us or by saying,\npull from this source and fill this out.\n\n201\n00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:11.720\nWhereas, this is contrived by the actual\nfunctions that we're donig and\n\n202\n00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.440\nhow that's working upon\nwhatever data we give it.\n\n203\n00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.190\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n204\n00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:18.210\n&gt;&gt; And it does create individual,\n\n205\n00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:20.220\nwhat are these?\n\n206\n00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.190\nFunctions.\nOkay.\n\n207\n00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:25.940\nSo, and this right here, notice this is a\nlittle bit different and notice the here.\n\n208\n00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:30.950\nLet me just escape out of that, so there's\nsome different syntax in here that you\n\n209\n00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:34.180\ndon't see in normal\nfunctions within Excel.\n\n210\n00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:37.150\nThey start with these squigly brackets,\nsee these squiglies?\n\n211\n00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:38.100\n&gt;&gt; Curly braces.\n\n212\n00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.250\n&gt;&gt; Curly braces?\n\n213\n00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:40.247\nI still call them squiggly brackets.\n\n214\n00:09:40.247 --> 00:09:43.330\n[LAUGH] And then we have this table, and\n\n215\n00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:46.660\nthen those two particular cells\nthat we're going to be referencing.\n\n216\n00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.820\nAnd this is known as an array, right?\n\n217\n00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:49.910\nYou know all about arrays.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n218\n00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:51.020\n&gt;&gt; Within programming languages and\n\n219\n00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.410\neverything like that and\nthat's really what this is.\n\n220\n00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:56.690\nJust go ahead, here's this,\nhere's this, and there's that spot.\n\n221\n00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:58.720\nBased on that particular calculation.\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n222\n00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.760\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, you don't have to know much\n\n223\n00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:04.370\npast that, so\ndon't overcomplicate your brain.\n\n224\n00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.950\nI'll show you.\nI just wanted to point it out.\n\n225\n00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:12.130\nAnd at least you know that you\nare creating your own calculations,\n\n226\n00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:15.720\nbut you're letting Excel\ndo all the hard lifting and\n\n227\n00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.920\nyou're just going to create, hey,\nthis is my one variable, this is my second\n\n228\n00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:24.220\nvariable if I have a second variable,\nand you just fill everything in.\n\n229\n00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:24.780\nPretty cool.\n\n230\n00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:28.600\nLet me show you how this works and\nagain this has been around for a while,\n\n231\n00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.550\nthis isn't a new feature.\n\n232\n00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:35.350\nLet's go with same information,\njust not completed.\n\n233\n00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:40.770\nSame idea, right, we've got our Christmas\ncats mouse and we've got our materials.\n\n234\n00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:42.130\nNothing fancy going on here.\n\n235\n00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:45.550\nAll I did was type in the word materials\nand I typed in the number $10,000.\n\n236\n00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:49.735\nAnd I formatted it as accounting.\n\n237\n00:10:49.735 --> 00:10:54.650\nIt's a reason why I have this box here\nis because I need to make my matrix.\n\n238\n00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.360\nI need to make my columns and\n\n239\n00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.870\nthen I going to make my, I'm going\nto make my rows and then my columns.\n\n240\n00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:07.810\nSo, the other thing I want to end up,\nI want to have my finish result.\n\n241\n00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:12.560\nAs the cost per toy because that thing,\nthis is the variable.\n\n242\n00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.940\nThe materials is the variable,\nbut this is my result.\n\n243\n00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:23.350\nSo I need to put in my result and\nthen have that changed.\n\n244\n00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:29.710\nNow I could very easily type\nin Hard code the number 2.75.\n\n245\n00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:36.190\nThat's okay and then do everything\nthat I'm gonna show you.\n\n246\n00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:41.920\nOr we're going to do something that\njust makes it a little bit more dynamic.\n\n247\n00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:45.800\nWe're gonna say put\nthe value of this cell here.\n\n248\n00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:46.810\nHere.\n\n249\n00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:54.830\nTake F5 and you're gonna say equals\nwhatever is in this cell, B12.\n\n250\n00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:56.210\nSo whatever's in B12,\n\n251\n00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:59.800\nI actually want it to go, it's almost\nlike an glorified copy and paste.\n\n252\n00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:04.210\nAnd just hit Enter after that, the reason\nit's a glorified is because if I change\n\n253\n00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:08.590\nthis or let's say I change this to\n15,000 because all of this is connected.\n\n254\n00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:09.650\nSee how that-\n&gt;&gt; It\n\n255\n00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:10.950\nupdates.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n256\n00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:12.620\n&gt;&gt; So it's linked to that cell and\n\n257\n00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:15.120\nnot just here's a value.\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yes.\n\n258\n00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.300\nWe can call them linked cells.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n259\n00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:18.180\n&gt;&gt; I think that's what\n\n260\n00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:18.922\nthey actually call them.\n\n261\n00:12:18.922 --> 00:12:19.434\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n262\n00:12:19.434 --> 00:12:21.020\n&gt;&gt; I'm pretty sure they do actually\n\n263\n00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.170\nnow that you say that.\n\n264\n00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:24.600\n[LAUGH] So exactly,\nI'm pulling information from here.\n\n265\n00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.993\nHave $10,000.\n\n266\n00:12:25.993 --> 00:12:28.705\nNow this is something\nthat I want to hard code.\n\n267\n00:12:28.705 --> 00:12:30.375\nI'm gonna say, all right,\n\n268\n00:12:30.375 --> 00:12:35.457\nwell the next iteration we'll do,\nBy $15,000, yeah, right?\n\n269\n00:12:35.457 --> 00:12:36.222\nThere we go.\n\n270\n00:12:36.222 --> 00:12:38.659\nLet's go ahead and-\n&gt;&gt; That's 11,5.\n\n271\n00:12:38.659 --> 00:12:39.911\n[LAUGH] Math, zeros.\n\n272\n00:12:39.911 --> 00:12:41.861\nCome on.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's\n\n273\n00:12:41.861 --> 00:12:43.473\nnot $1,500.\n&gt;&gt;

We're going to be increasing our\n\n281\n00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:54.290\nincrements of our material costs-\n&gt;&gt; By $1,500.\n\n282\n00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:55.320\n&gt;&gt; There you go, thank you.\n\n283\n00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.420\n&gt;&gt; I'm picking up what you're putting\n\n284\n00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.730\ndown.\n&gt;&gt; That's why\n\n285\n00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:58.420\nyou're here for me.\n\n286\n00:12:58.420 --> 00:12:59.240\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n287\n00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.510\n&gt;&gt; So, I'm gonna take this,\n\n288\n00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:03.020\nand this is where we're\njust doing a series,\n\n289\n00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:06.890\nwe're taking the iteration,\npulling this down, we'll say, there we go.\n\n290\n00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:09.880\nSo, that's like the top we'll go,\nwe won't go more than $20,500.\n\n291\n00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:14.260\nCool, so I got everything set up,\nall we gotta do,\n\n292\n00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:18.990\nwe gotta set up our matrix,\nset up our table, and\n\n293\n00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:23.250\nnow we want to do the calculations and\ncreate our data table.\n\n294\n00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:26.960\nSo, we are going to select the table.\n\n295\n00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.490\ntable, okay.\n\n296\n00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:32.350\nYeah, [LAUGH] The range,\nwe're just gonna call the range.\n\n297\n00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:33.830\nThat we're creating the static tables.\n\n298\n00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:34.470\nSo, there we go.\n\n299\n00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:38.960\nYou can see we've got our variable or\nour column reference, and\n\n300\n00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.340\nwe have the rose going across.\n\n301\n00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:45.154\nWe go over the data,\nWe'll go to the what/if analysis, and\n\n302\n00:13:45.154 --> 00:13:48.372\nsee there are actually\nthree different ones.\n\n303\n00:13:48.372 --> 00:13:51.094\nThey are all similar, but different.\n\n304\n00:13:51.094 --> 00:13:54.395\n[LAUGH] So\nwe're going to go with the data table.\n\n305\n00:13:54.395 --> 00:13:56.539\nNow, what do I want to change?\n\n306\n00:13:56.539 --> 00:14:00.670\nThis is all you get; a row input and\na column input.\n\n307\n00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:07.880\nRight now this is a one variable table\nright, we're talking about the materials.\n\n308\n00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:13.325\nOkay, so what we're going to do is we\nare going to put this into our column,\n\n309\n00:14:13.325 --> 00:14:16.590\nright, because this is going down, right?\n\n310\n00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:19.360\nIt's not going across, it's going down.\n\n311\n00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:24.610\nSo the column input cell is this one,\nthis is the value,\n\n312\n00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:31.820\nthat is the thing that's changing going\ndown, when I click okay, there you go.\n\n313\n00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.264\nSo did that make sense?\n\n314\n00:14:33.264 --> 00:14:34.850\nBecause I always have to think about this,\nI'm like,\n\n315\n00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:39.290\nwait, column, row reference it's\na single variable data table right now.\n\n316\n00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:41.350\nI'm changing these numbers,\n\n317\n00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:44.240\nwhich is really the change in that.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n318\n00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.510\n&gt;&gt; And it's going down.\n\n319\n00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:46.710\nThat's my column.\n\n320\n00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:49.170\nAnd so it's creating,\nalright then, there we go.\n\n321\n00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:50.410\nThat's exactly what's changing.\n\n322\n00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:52.240\nIf I look at this,\n\n323\n00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:58.650\nI can get this down to $2.25 if I\ngo with materials that are $10,000.\n\n324\n00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:00.570\nBelow the way up now why\nis this not formatted?\n\n325\n00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:03.490\nThese are I preformatted\nthese cells all the way okay.\n\n326\n00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:04.970\n&gt;&gt; So that cell isn't in format?\n\n327\n00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:06.698\n&gt;&gt; Yes, correct, so I actually,\n\n328\n00:15:06.698 --> 00:15:10.987\nin the example because I basically did it\nand then deleted the data out of it, but\n\n329\n00:15:10.987 --> 00:15:14.637\nit left the formatted, we talk\nabout that in the essential series,\n\n330\n00:15:14.637 --> 00:15:17.472\nso I just didn't format\nthis as accounting, okay?\n\n331\n00:15:17.472 --> 00:15:20.609\nSo that's the only reason why that\nlooked a little different and\n\n332\n00:15:20.609 --> 00:15:22.270\nthese automatically.\n\n333\n00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:24.810\nOr format as dollars, okay?\n\n334\n00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:28.320\nSo there we go, pretty cool,\nbecause that's the one variable.\n\n335\n00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:35.450\nNow remember, all of this, cost per toy is\nbased is off of these two values, right?\n\n336\n00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:37.950\nSo if I changed my labor.\n\n337\n00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:41.460\nLet's say, well since we're going\nto be buying more expensive\n\n338\n00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:45.137\nmaybe When you increase\nour labor to $15,000.\n\n339\n00:15:45.137 --> 00:15:48.280\nWell notice how it changed everything,\ndidn't it?\n\n340\n00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:48.850\nRight?\n\n341\n00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:53.182\nBecause yes, this is a data table\nbased on this particular variable.\n\n342\n00:15:53.182 --> 00:15:56.125\nBut if I change something\nelse within the formula,\n\n343\n00:15:56.125 --> 00:15:58.732\nthen it's going to change everything else.\n\n344\n00:15:58.732 --> 00:16:03.606\nSo you can kind of do some what if\nanalysis of like Let's get that labor\n\n345\n00:16:03.606 --> 00:16:05.131\ndown to 8,000.\n\n346\n00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:06.430\nOkay, there we go.\n\n347\n00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:10.440\nThe transport, we can get that down to\n1500 cuz we're using a different service.\n\n348\n00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.070\nOkay, cool.\n\n349\n00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:14.540\nSo I mean you can have other variables\n\n350\n00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.200\nwithin just the data\nthat you're working with.\n\n351\n00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:20.190\nBut this table is only going\nto look at one specific one.\n\n352\n00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:22.590\nSo kinda neat, I like it.\n\n353\n00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:26.870\nThat's what we have with our what\nif analysis with data tables.\n\n354\n00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:30.610\nOne variable, or\nwe can do two variables, okay?\n\n355\n00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:31.970\nSomething like this.\n\n356\n00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:37.810\nJust like we saw in the example, I have\nthe result of the formula right here.\n\n357\n00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:39.640\nThis is my cross reference, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n358\n00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:40.860\n&gt;&gt; This is where my rows and\n\n359\n00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.920\nmy columns\n&gt;&gt; Are going to made off of,\n\n360\n00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:46.320\nas opposed to the one variable and\nthen the pieces.\n\n361\n00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.790\nSo I went ahead and prepopulated this.\n\n362\n00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:53.180\nThese are hard coded right, they're just\nnumbers right, different percentages.\n\n363\n00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:55.890\nThese are different values,\nwhoops that's the wrong one, right here.\n\n364\n00:16:55.890 --> 00:17:01.040\nAnd so\nnow I wanna take Make a table out of this.\n\n365\n00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.920\nSo we select this whole thing, right?\n\n366\n00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:08.140\nThese are the originating cells that\nthese values are going to change off of.\n\n367\n00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:15.420\nSo we select it, data, data table,\nand now we have rows and columns.\n\n368\n00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:21.480\nMy row reference, what's going across,\nso that's going to be This.\n\n369\n00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.220\nI didn't format that as money.\n\n370\n00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:24.730\nI probably should have.\n\n371\n00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:27.750\nEh, it's okay.\n&gt;&gt; We'll let it slide this time.\n\n372\n00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:28.620\n&gt;&gt; Okay, thanks.\n\n373\n00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:31.100\nSo that's my row input.\n\n374\n00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:35.370\nMy column, what is going down,\nthat's going to be my discount.\n\n375\n00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:37.690\nThis is a very basic one but\nI wanna try to keep it simple.\n\n376\n00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:38.780\nAnd then you click OK.\n\n377\n00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:41.790\nAnd then it poof Populates.\n&gt;&gt; Populates the whole\n\n378\n00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:42.730\nthing, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n379\n00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:43.370\nPretty neat.\n&gt;&gt; Very\n\n380\n00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:44.250\nnice.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n381\n00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:46.040\nSo you can go ahead and see very quickly.\n\n382\n00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.700\nAll right,\nhere's my matrix of my different\n\n383\n00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:51.930\nprice and my discount.\n&gt;&gt; And now all you have to do if you wanna\n\n384\n00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:54.980\ndo your what if scenario is go to\nthe price or discount or both.\n\n385\n00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.780\nAnd make some changes to see\nhow that will work itself out.\n\n386\n00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:58.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, so\n\n387\n00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:01.510\nI mean that's just a cool way that you\ncan do some of these what if tables.\n\n388\n00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:04.540\nI mean depending on the complexity\nof your data depends on.\n\n389\n00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:09.720\nWhether or not this would achieve the\nresult that you want and things like that.\n\n390\n00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.130\nSo that's something that you can do,\n\n391\n00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:15.610\njust for some different variations\non some of these things, right.\n\n392\n00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:19.710\nHere we have a PMT function,\npayment, right.\n\n393\n00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:25.649\nI want to determine the payments that I\nwould need on say, a loan of $10,000.\n\n394\n00:18:25.649 --> 00:18:30.760\nThat has a specific time that I would\nneed to pay it and a specific interest.\n\n395\n00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.880\nThese are things we get\non the bank all the time.\n\n396\n00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, called the amortization\n\n397\n00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.620\ntable.\n&gt;&gt; Yes!\n\n398\n00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:36.540\nAnd, if you're going to do it.\n\n399\n00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:37.950\nMake sure to contact your bank,\n\n400\n00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:41.380\ndon't say, well my Excel sheet says\nthat this is what's gonna happen.\n\n401\n00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:43.260\nYou know,\nthere's different variables there.\n\n402\n00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:47.010\nSo notice that this is just\nsaying that this is the result of\n\n403\n00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:49.710\ntaking this particular,\nhere I'll zoom in a little bit.\n\n404\n00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:51.900\nSo we have this interest,\nwhich is divided by 12.\n\n405\n00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:54.150\nCuz it's over 12 months, right?\n\n406\n00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:57.580\nAnd then this is the length\nof a loan in months.\n\n407\n00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:00.270\nAnd then this is the loan amount.\n\n408\n00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:03.280\nAnd so that will go ahead and calculate.\n\n409\n00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:07.200\nI'm going to hit the escape key, sometimes\nit gets a little weird on me, there we go.\n\n410\n00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.240\nAnd then it creates it.\n\n411\n00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:11.860\nIt automatically formats it\nas a negative number because\n\n412\n00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:14.360\nit's coming out of your bank account.\n\n413\n00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.300\nSo then you go ahead and set this up.\n\n414\n00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:17.890\nSo these are the variables, right?\n\n415\n00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:22.120\nThis is going to be the loan term,\nthe number of months.\n\n416\n00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.530\nThis is the loan amount.\n\n417\n00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:25.510\nThis is the interest rate.\n\n418\n00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:28.080\nSo that's not part of our\nvariable in the table,\n\n419\n00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:29.170\ncorrect?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n420\n00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:31.410\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so we're gonna take this and\n\n421\n00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:33.630\nhow far over did I go?\n&gt;&gt; You went far.\n\n422\n00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.040\n&gt;&gt; No, that's it, perfect.\n\n423\n00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:39.420\nSo we will take and do it one more time.\n\n424\n00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:42.050\nAnd then what's the row\ninput there Daniel?\n\n425\n00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:44.630\n&gt;&gt; The row input will be the loan.\n\n426\n00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:46.500\n&gt;&gt; Yes, going across.\n\n427\n00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.130\nAnd then the column input\ngoing down would be the?\n\n428\n00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:51.990\n&gt;&gt; That will be the,\n\n429\n00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:53.740\nis that the months?\n\n430\n00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:54.252\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n431\n00:19:54.252 --> 00:19:54.869\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n432\n00:19:54.869 --> 00:19:55.889\n&gt;&gt; I'm having a hard time seeing,\n\n433\n00:19:55.889 --> 00:19:58.699\nit's not as easy.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is hard to see the monitors\n\n434\n00:19:58.699 --> 00:20:01.769\nup here, so I'm\n&gt;&gt; I'm really pushing the limits for\n\n435\n00:20:01.769 --> 00:20:02.829\nyou sorry about that.\n[LAUGH]\n\n436\n00:20:02.829 --> 00:20:04.899\n&gt;&gt; Not so good on the eye sockets anyway\n\n437\n00:20:04.899 --> 00:20:08.219\nyou know what are you gonna do?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So then it goes ahead and does.\n\n438\n00:20:08.219 --> 00:20:09.809\nSo this is where you can kinda determine,\n\n439\n00:20:09.809 --> 00:20:13.079\nokay well how much car or house?\nAnd\n\n440\n00:20:13.079 --> 00:20:17.230\nthen like if I did a longer loan and\neverything now that.\n\n441\n00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:21.490\nAgain, talk to your bank.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is super basic because\n\n442\n00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:25.140\nit doesn't take into account that there\nare some months 30 days, some have 31.\n\n443\n00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:28.140\nOne has 28 or 29 depending on whether or\nnot it's a leap year.\n\n444\n00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.550\nAnd yeah it gets real\nconvoluted real fast.\n\n445\n00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:32.070\nI wrote a program that actually does this.\n\n446\n00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.640\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; In C.\n\n447\n00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.050\nYeah I wrote it in C.\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n448\n00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:35.692\n&gt;&gt; It was not easy.\n\n449\n00:20:35.692 --> 00:20:36.487\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n450\n00:20:36.487 --> 00:20:39.480\n&gt;&gt; You thought I'm just gonna whip some\n\n451\n00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:42.190\nhold on that's hard.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n452\n00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:43.500\n&gt;&gt; Dealing with dates\n\n453\n00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.040\ncan be very, very difficult.\n\n454\n00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.700\nRight yeah exactly that\n\n455\n00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:47.660\nwe've talked about this.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n456\n00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:48.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah not fun so\n\n457\n00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:50.418\ntalk to your bank don't rely on this.\n&gt;&gt; Don't go.\n\n458\n00:20:50.418 --> 00:20:52.190\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is very rough sketch of what\n\n459\n00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:53.600\nit would look like, yeah.\n\n460\n00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.790\nIt just gives you an idea yes.\n&gt;&gt; And using the data tables with\n\n461\n00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:59.630\nthe multiple variables at least two\nvariables would have been very nice.\n\n462\n00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:03.720\nSo that's nothing new that I haven't\nshown you but this right here.\n\n463\n00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.460\nWe talked about you just type it in.\n\n464\n00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:09.730\nI could say all right well what if it's\n6% and then how all these numbers change.\n\n465\n00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:12.720\nOr then, I found one that's like 3.5,\nokay cool.\n\n466\n00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.700\nSo that's some neat\nthings that I could do.\n\n467\n00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:19.840\nNow this is in another episode, so this\nis, I'm kind of foreshadowing right now.\n\n468\n00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.340\nSo there's something that\nyou could do a drop down.\n\n469\n00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:26.790\nLike I could drop this down and\nquickly switch between different values.\n\n470\n00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:29.780\nThis isn't a data evaluation,\nso check out that episode.\n\n471\n00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:33.440\nThere's other things within this,\nbut notice right here we have some.\n\n472\n00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:38.220\nI have some typed in values, five\npercent seven and half and ten percent.\n\n473\n00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:43.330\nYou can take and basically call that list\nvalue and then it will change all of this.\n\n474\n00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:46.410\nSo just different variations\non some things you can do.\n\n475\n00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:50.920\nSo if I go to Data Validation, and\nthen I'm going to go into a list.\n\n476\n00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:55.380\nThe list has to be somewhere, so\nyou put your cursor in the source.\n\n477\n00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.900\nIt could be on another worksheet,\nby the way, that you could hide and\n\n478\n00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.280\ndo some stuff with.\n\n479\n00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.430\nSelect these, you click.\n\n480\n00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:05.030\nOkay, so now the cool thing is you\njust got this cute little drop down.\n\n481\n00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:07.080\nThat you can change a different values,\nand\n\n482\n00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:10.490\nthen it's going to change your data table.\n\n483\n00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:15.049\nAnd help you in your what if\nanalysis of your numbers.\n\n484\n00:22:15.049 --> 00:22:17.881\nAnd do all of your crunching and\nall that kind of fun stuff.\n\n485\n00:22:17.881 --> 00:22:20.679\nSo there you go, some neat little things.\n\n486\n00:22:20.679 --> 00:22:23.846\nAnd some foreshadowing some other\noptions that we're going to do later\n\n487\n00:22:23.846 --> 00:22:24.840\ndown the road.\n\n488\n00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.320\nBut that tables been around for a while.\n\n489\n00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:31.640\nAnd hopefully it will help you be\nable to report whatever you need to\n\n490\n00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.271\nreport to your boss.\n\n491\n00:22:32.271 --> 00:22:32.970\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah, exactly.\n\n50\n00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:00.391\nAnd the way that we're going to do it,\nand I'm gonna show you like the results,\n\n51\n00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:03.314\nthere is a whole bunch of other\nways that you could do this, okay.\n\n52\n00:02:03.314 --> 00:02:05.515\nYou could do some if function,\n\n53\n00:02:05.515 --> 00:02:09.162\nyou could do a table the we\nsaw in our other episode.\n\n54\n00:02:09.162 --> 00:02:12.282\nWhere you could do that\n[INAUDIBLE] something like that.\n\n55\n00:02:12.282 --> 00:02:15.450\nMany other ways to\naccomplish the same thing.\n\n56\n00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.059\nThis is,\nI would say maybe an older command.\n\n57\n00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:22.297\nIt's been around in Excel for\na while, okay.\n\n58\n00:02:22.297 --> 00:02:24.873\nSo this goes way, way back.\n\n59\n00:02:24.873 --> 00:02:29.009\nSo, let's take a look at what it does and\nthen you can determine whether or\n\n60\n00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:30.225\nnot you wanna try it.\n\n61\n00:02:30.225 --> 00:02:33.762\nOkay, so we have a worksheet, a workbook,\nactually, called Consolidate.\n\n62\n00:02:33.762 --> 00:02:35.781\nHave a couple of worksheets at the bottom.\n\n63\n00:02:35.781 --> 00:02:40.514\nThis is Sales Months, and we're just\nlooking at, we have a couple categories.\n\n64\n00:02:40.514 --> 00:02:43.525\nWe can see toys, food,\nclothing, accessories, and\n\n65\n00:02:43.525 --> 00:02:46.748\nthen that's pretty much what\nwe've got all the way down.\n\n66\n00:02:46.748 --> 00:02:49.600\nSo those are our four categories.\n\n67\n00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.578\nIt's not sorted, it's not in any order.\n\n68\n00:02:51.578 --> 00:02:55.492\nAnd then what we have over here\nare the totals and this could be anything,\n\n69\n00:02:55.492 --> 00:02:59.362\nmaybe the totals for that particular day,\nthat month, what have you.\n\n70\n00:02:59.362 --> 00:03:03.871\nAnd I need to consolidate\nthis information.\n\n71\n00:03:03.871 --> 00:03:08.384\nMaybe something like hey, I wanna sum\nup all the toys and the clothing and\n\n72\n00:03:08.384 --> 00:03:10.984\nthe accessories then within this range.\n\n73\n00:03:10.984 --> 00:03:15.529\nAnd just give me the summary,\nthe consolidation,\n\n74\n00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:21.353\nthe result of this information\nbased on this particular column.\n\n75\n00:03:21.353 --> 00:03:25.533\nLook at all the different categories,\ngroup them up together and\n\n76\n00:03:25.533 --> 00:03:30.105\nthen perform the particular function\nthat I'm going to tell you to do.\n\n77\n00:03:30.105 --> 00:03:33.395\nThat's it, I mean that's what why we're\ngoing different consolidating our data.\n\n78\n00:03:33.395 --> 00:03:36.030\nSo,we do the headings here, nice.\n\n79\n00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.099\nThat is important cuz you need to be\nable to label your information for\n\n80\n00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:43.760\nthis particular command to\nunderstand what it is looking at.\n\n81\n00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.729\nSo, that's just the same with all\nthe data you're really on Excel.\n\n82\n00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:50.542\nYou really need header rows or\nsome type of labels for\n\n83\n00:03:50.542 --> 00:03:54.030\nit to kind do anything.\n&gt;&gt; Right, cuz you're starting to define\n\n84\n00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.635\nthings and if you can't have some really\nsolid definitions, then you're gonna\n\n85\n00:03:57.635 --> 00:04:00.835\nhave a hard time just a bunch of data\nrunning around going what's this?\n\n86\n00:04:00.835 --> 00:04:02.666\nI don't know it's something,\nit's nice, right?\n\n87\n00:04:02.666 --> 00:04:03.554\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n\n88\n00:04:03.554 --> 00:04:05.078\n&gt;&gt; And it's not until we say,\n\n89\n00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:05.877\nwe have toys.\n\n90\n00:04:05.877 --> 00:04:07.606\nDo we do something with toys?\n\n91\n00:04:07.606 --> 00:04:08.735\nThis is a toy.\n\n92\n00:04:08.735 --> 00:04:09.761\nThat's a toy.\n\n93\n00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:12.627\nThis is clothing and\nthat is clothing or we can go,\n\n94\n00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:15.427\nwell since this and\nthat are both clothes I can put\n\n95\n00:04:15.427 --> 00:04:17.777\nthem under the clothing category.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n96\n00:04:17.777 --> 00:04:18.801\n&gt;&gt; And consolidate.\n\n97\n00:04:18.801 --> 00:04:19.365\n&gt;&gt; Those are categories.\n\n98\n00:04:19.365 --> 00:04:20.005\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n99\n00:04:20.005 --> 00:04:24.585\nso there is a little like pointed\neffort in doing this like.\n\n100\n00:04:24.585 --> 00:04:27.693\nYou can't just have a bunch\nof random pieces of data,\n\n101\n00:04:27.693 --> 00:04:29.705\nthey need to be able to be grouped.\n\n102\n00:04:29.705 --> 00:04:31.327\nAnd be able to be categorized.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I mean,\n\n103\n00:04:31.327 --> 00:04:33.609\nit's just like if you were in access or\nany type of database.\n\n104\n00:04:33.609 --> 00:04:36.883\nYou need to have like this is the field,\nthis is the first name field,\n\n105\n00:04:36.883 --> 00:04:39.549\nthis is the last name field,\nthis is the address field.\n\n106\n00:04:39.549 --> 00:04:43.828\nOtherwise, it's just column\na column b column c and like.\n\n107\n00:04:43.828 --> 00:04:45.070\n&gt;&gt; Like what does that mean?\n\n108\n00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.393\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, so\n\n109\n00:04:47.393 --> 00:04:51.706\nit helps to have labels in your data.\n&gt;&gt; I\n\n110\n00:04:51.706 --> 00:04:54.786\nwould assume even if that\nlabel is random stuff, right?\n\n111\n00:04:54.786 --> 00:04:57.072\nBecause you might have a bunch of\nstuff that is consolidable, and\n\n112\n00:04:57.072 --> 00:04:58.411\nthen there's all these random bits.\n\n113\n00:04:58.411 --> 00:04:59.107\nYou go, random bits.\n\n114\n00:04:59.107 --> 00:05:00.809\nWhat does that equal?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n115\n00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:02.138\n&gt;&gt; What's that consolidated down to?\n\n116\n00:05:02.138 --> 00:05:03.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it does have to match.\n\n117\n00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.370\nIt's basically matching.\n\n118\n00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.071\nSo just know it and make sure that you\nhave something up at the top of these\n\n119\n00:05:09.071 --> 00:05:12.729\ncolumns to understand that this is\nthe category, this is the totals.\n\n120\n00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:13.484\nThat's the biggest part.\n\n121\n00:05:13.484 --> 00:05:15.186\nSo, we are going to copy this.\n\n122\n00:05:15.186 --> 00:05:17.544\nI'm just showing you, this as an example.\n\n123\n00:05:17.544 --> 00:05:21.197\nI'm going to copy the headings over,\nput them over here.\n\n124\n00:05:21.197 --> 00:05:24.785\nI'll show you a different example of why\nyou don't necessarily have to do that.\n\n125\n00:05:24.785 --> 00:05:27.461\nBut just for this example,\nI'm gonna show you.\n\n126\n00:05:27.461 --> 00:05:30.562\nI'm gonna hit the escape key so\nI can get rid of the running apps.\n\n127\n00:05:30.562 --> 00:05:33.412\nSo, we're going to go\nover to our data tab and\n\n128\n00:05:33.412 --> 00:05:35.901\nwe are going to go over to consolidate.\n\n129\n00:05:35.901 --> 00:05:36.602\nOkay.\n\n130\n00:05:36.602 --> 00:05:37.978\nI should probably point out.\n\n131\n00:05:37.978 --> 00:05:41.713\nI should put my cursor and select this out\nwhere I want the information to go to.\n\n132\n00:05:41.713 --> 00:05:44.646\nBecause I want it to be able\nto summarize and consolidate.\n\n133\n00:05:44.646 --> 00:05:48.736\nPut toys, food, clothing,\naccessories here.\n\n134\n00:05:48.736 --> 00:05:52.980\nAnd then, sum up all of\nthe totals within this column.\n\n135\n00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.068\nCool.\nSo make sure you put your cursor there.\n\n136\n00:05:55.068 --> 00:05:56.514\nWe're going to consolidate.\n\n137\n00:05:56.514 --> 00:06:01.627\nAnd then, this where you pick\nthe function that you want it to perform.\n\n138\n00:06:01.627 --> 00:06:05.527\nAnd that it doesn't have all functions\nin itself but it has like the big ones,\n\n139\n00:06:05.527 --> 00:06:09.139\nlike add it up, count it up, average,\nmean, mass that kind of stuff.\n\n140\n00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:11.685\nSo we're gonna stick with the basic and\ngo with some.\n\n141\n00:06:11.685 --> 00:06:15.644\nAnd that's lovely.\n\n142\n00:06:15.644 --> 00:06:17.633\nIt went ahead and crashed on me.\n\n143\n00:06:17.633 --> 00:06:20.011\nThis happened another time.\n&gt;&gt; We've seen this before.\n\n144\n00:06:20.011 --> 00:06:21.459\n&gt;&gt; I know, you know.\n\n145\n00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:22.250\n&gt;&gt; It really hates us [LAUGH].\n\n146\n00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.602\n&gt;&gt; It really does.\n\n147\n00:06:23.602 --> 00:06:25.371\nNot really sure why it crashed, guys.\n\n148\n00:06:25.371 --> 00:06:27.875\nBut guess what, it does.\n&gt;&gt; Again, happens to us too.\n\n149\n00:06:27.875 --> 00:06:28.713\n&gt;&gt; Yep, yeah,\n\n150\n00:06:28.713 --> 00:06:32.497\nI don't think it likes my zoom sometimes.\n&gt;&gt; Well, stop doing that then.\n\n151\n00:06:32.497 --> 00:06:33.973\n&gt;&gt; You know I will, I will do that.\n\n152\n00:06:33.973 --> 00:06:37.008\nYou guys are just gonna have to trust me\nthat this is the information that we're\n\n153\n00:06:37.008 --> 00:06:38.489\nsummarizing.\n&gt;&gt; You got your magnifiers.\n\n154\n00:06:38.489 --> 00:06:40.129\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n155\n00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:41.577\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's try this again.\n\n156\n00:06:41.577 --> 00:06:42.434\nWe'll put that over there.\n\n157\n00:06:42.434 --> 00:06:44.396\nPut our cursor where we want\nthe information to go to.\n\n158\n00:06:44.396 --> 00:06:46.262\nI'll get you right back to\nthe place where we're at.\n\n159\n00:06:46.262 --> 00:06:48.796\nWe're gonna use the sum function, perfect.\n\n160\n00:06:48.796 --> 00:06:52.997\nSo then the next thing we need to do\nis we need to create our references.\n\n161\n00:06:52.997 --> 00:06:58.097\nWhat am I referencing to do the summing\nand consolidating this information.\n\n162\n00:06:58.097 --> 00:07:01.338\nSo my cursors in this particular field,\nthat's what I want.\n\n163\n00:07:01.338 --> 00:07:06.728\nI'm going to come out into my worksheet\nand I'm going to select the information.\n\n164\n00:07:06.728 --> 00:07:10.304\nNow I can use my Shift-click to\ngo ahead and select my range, so\n\n165\n00:07:10.304 --> 00:07:12.881\nI'll hold my Shift,\nput that in the bottom.\n\n166\n00:07:12.881 --> 00:07:14.443\nSo here's the range of information.\n\n167\n00:07:14.443 --> 00:07:18.632\nNotice, I don't need the headings in this\nparticular example that I'm showing you.\n\n168\n00:07:18.632 --> 00:07:23.774\nI just need this information,\nbecause it all correlates together.\n\n169\n00:07:23.774 --> 00:07:25.369\nJust keep that thought, okay?\n\n170\n00:07:25.369 --> 00:07:27.409\nI'll show you another way to do this.\n\n171\n00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:30.253\nThings that you've gotta remember\nto do here, you have to add it.\n\n172\n00:07:30.253 --> 00:07:34.381\nIf you don't add this into this place\nwhere it has all of your references,\n\n173\n00:07:34.381 --> 00:07:37.120\nnotice of course that you\ncan have more than one.\n\n174\n00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.937\nCome back to that in a little bit too.\n\n175\n00:07:38.937 --> 00:07:39.813\nAnd that's it.\n\n176\n00:07:39.813 --> 00:07:46.338\nSo I just say, sum up this range,\nand I did forget one part.\n\n177\n00:07:46.338 --> 00:07:48.850\n[LAUGH] That's really important, okay?\n\n178\n00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:50.026\nIt's down here.\n\n179\n00:07:50.026 --> 00:07:53.927\nOkay, so use the labels in.\n\n180\n00:07:53.927 --> 00:07:54.863\nWhat do I want to find?\n\n181\n00:07:54.863 --> 00:07:57.471\nI wanna find that left column there.\n\n182\n00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:00.421\nOkay, so that's important.\n\n183\n00:08:00.421 --> 00:08:04.010\nAnd this links to data,\ndon't worry about that for right now.\n\n184\n00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:05.030\nI'll show you another example.\n\n185\n00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:08.120\nWe click okay and then there you go.\n\n186\n00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.964\nSo I basically said pick the left column.\n\n187\n00:08:09.964 --> 00:08:13.099\nThat's the thing that I want you to\nfind the labels of things that I'm\n\n188\n00:08:13.099 --> 00:08:15.980\nsummarizing using that range then\nfind the numbers next to it.\n\n189\n00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.040\nAnd then go ahead and add it all up.\n\n190\n00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:18.640\nThere you go.\n\n191\n00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.220\nAnd you can see that yeah\nthat's exactly what it did.\n\n192\n00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:25.020\nIt summed up all the toys, the food,\nthe clothing and the accessories.\n\n193\n00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:25.886\nNeat.\n\n194\n00:08:25.886 --> 00:08:31.010\nYou would notice though right here that\nthat is just a cell with a value in it.\n\n195\n00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.470\nThere is no function there.\n\n196\n00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:38.450\nThere is no type of references,\nlike cell references.\n\n197\n00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:39.740\nIt just went ahead and did it.\n\n198\n00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:42.350\nAll that calculations is\ndone behind the scenes.\n\n199\n00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:43.490\n&gt;&gt; And then just kind of dumps it into\n\n200\n00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:47.112\nthe cells that you told it to dump into.\n&gt;&gt; Correct, and that means that if I\n\n201\n00:08:47.112 --> 00:08:52.044\ntook this and I took and made this like\n$10,000 worth of toys, that didn't change.\n\n202\n00:08:52.044 --> 00:08:52.968\nDid it?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n203\n00:08:52.968 --> 00:08:55.460\nYou have to rerun your consolidation.\n\n204\n00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:56.650\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; Got you.\n\n205\n00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:58.110\n&gt;&gt; The way that I just showed you how to\n\n206\n00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.440\ndo it, remember there's that little\nbox that says something about like\n\n207\n00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.100\ncreating links to the data?\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n208\n00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We'll do it again.\n\n209\n00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:04.710\n&gt;&gt; It's there.\n\n210\n00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:06.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I didn't that check that\n\n211\n00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:08.190\nspecifically because I wanted\n\n212\n00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:11.680\nto show that if you don't it\ndoesn't create links to your data.\n\n213\n00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:15.330\nAnd it's this all in one\nworksheet with one range.\n\n214\n00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.530\nSo it wouldn't even allow me\nto create links anyways, okay.\n\n215\n00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:22.490\nSo it's just a quick way of\nconsolidating your information and\n\n216\n00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:24.130\nsumming all the information up.\n\n217\n00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:25.750\nCool, that sounds good.\n\n218\n00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:30.970\nAnd that's the most basic way that\nyou can go ahead and use Consolidate.\n\n219\n00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:33.410\nBut the real power, I guess you could say,\n\n220\n00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:39.220\nis if you use it across multiple\nworksheets and/or multiple workbooks.\n\n221\n00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:40.443\nThat's the kind of fun stuff, [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt;

Yes.\n\n225\n00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.690\n&gt;&gt; Now that's kind of cool.\n\n226\n00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:50.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and of course,\n\n227\n00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.570\nyou could use 3D cell references and\nthere's other ways to do it.\n\n228\n00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:56.710\nYou can use functions across worksheets,\nokay.\n\n229\n00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:01.292\nSo it's not the be all and end all of\nthis is the only way you can do this.\n\n230\n00:10:01.292 --> 00:10:01.967\nBut, [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; It's the quick and\n\n231\n00:10:01.967 --> 00:10:02.562\neasy way to do it, [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; It\n\n232\n00:10:02.562 --> 00:10:03.083\nis.\n&gt;&gt; That's for\n\n233\n00:10:03.083 --> 00:10:03.707\nsure.\n&gt;&gt;

So I wanna use the labels in the top\n\n356\n00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:54.000\nand on the left.\n\n357\n00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.020\nI wanna consolidate both of them.\n\n358\n00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:56.601\nThe other one,\n\n359\n00:14:56.601 --> 00:14:58.314\nit was only one information so-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n360\n00:14:58.314 --> 00:14:59.329\n&gt;&gt; That's why we only used the left,\n\n361\n00:14:59.329 --> 00:15:00.070\nwe didn't need the top.\n\n362\n00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:03.040\nAnd we'd already copied everything over.\n\n363\n00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:06.178\nAnd the references or the range\nthat we selected didn't even have\n\n364\n00:15:06.178 --> 00:15:07.120\nthe labels in it.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n365\n00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:10.170\nthis is gonna consolidate for\neach one of the city names?\n\n366\n00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:13.330\nAnd say, Gainesville has this much and\nit's all consolidation\n\n367\n00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:14.660\nbetween the three months.\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n368\n00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.300\n&gt;&gt; And Jacksonville and so on and\n\n369\n00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.062\nso forth.\n&gt;&gt; For the mouse, the snake, [CROSSTALK]\n\n370\n00:15:18.062 --> 00:15:18.661\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n371\n00:15:18.661 --> 00:15:19.741\n&gt;&gt; And the two balls, yes exactly.\n\n372\n00:15:19.741 --> 00:15:21.870\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I think we're following you.\n\n373\n00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:22.610\n&gt;&gt; Good, yes.\n\n374\n00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:24.070\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully when you actually\n\n375\n00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:27.390\ndo the go thing we are like that's\nexactly what I think was gonna happen.\n\n376\n00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:29.532\nAnd not I was wrong, horribly.\n\n377\n00:15:29.532 --> 00:15:30.440\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But Travis,\n\n378\n00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.240\nI feel like that happens to me everyday.\n\n379\n00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.940\nBut yes, so right here, create links.\n\n380\n00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:38.650\nWe are going to do that because\nwhat do you think it's gonna do?\n\n381\n00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:39.604\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna create a link.\n\n382\n00:15:39.604 --> 00:15:40.456\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n383\n00:15:40.456 --> 00:15:40.982\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n384\n00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:41.566\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n385\n00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:42.250\nexactly.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n386\n00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:43.522\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the whole updating thing that\n\n387\n00:15:43.522 --> 00:15:45.432\nI did the $10,000 of.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n388\n00:15:45.432 --> 00:15:49.785\ncuz then if you make a change then it'll\nbe automatically seen there, right?\n\n389\n00:15:49.785 --> 00:15:50.524\n&gt;&gt; Definately.\n\n390\n00:15:50.524 --> 00:15:51.040\n&gt;&gt; That's what we like.\n\n391\n00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:51.978\n&gt;&gt; That's what we want.\n\n392\n00:15:51.978 --> 00:15:55.200\nAnd we click okay, and there you go.\n\n393\n00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.850\nSo if we look at this, yeah, look, cool.\n\n394\n00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:02.247\nIt went ahead and put in the mouse, and\nthe snake, and the crinkle ball, and\n\n395\n00:16:02.247 --> 00:16:03.540\nthe bouncy ball.\n\n396\n00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:07.632\nAnd if I look, okay so there's 20, 20, 20,\n\n397\n00:16:07.632 --> 00:16:12.397\nthat's 6, yeah it worked.\n&gt;&gt; Pretty consistently with those mouse,\n\n398\n00:16:12.397 --> 00:16:13.274\nmice.\n&gt;&gt; Right, the mice?\n\n399\n00:16:13.274 --> 00:16:14.517\n&gt;&gt; The mice.\n\n400\n00:16:14.517 --> 00:16:16.535\n&gt;&gt; That's what I call them,\n\n401\n00:16:16.535 --> 00:16:17.631\nthe mices.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n402\n00:16:17.631 --> 00:16:20.096\nnow, if we make a change on one of those,\nwe get one of those 20s and\n\n403\n00:16:20.096 --> 00:16:22.020\nwe say, we had a banner month, it was 40.\n\n404\n00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:25.077\nWe should then have a difference-\n&gt;&gt; How about 200?\n\n405\n00:16:25.077 --> 00:16:25.587\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, go crazy.\n\n406\n00:16:25.587 --> 00:16:26.408\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, 200,\n\n407\n00:16:26.408 --> 00:16:27.447\nlet's look at it.\n&gt;&gt; We went mouse\n\n408\n00:16:27.447 --> 00:16:27.951\nnuts.\n&gt;&gt; Now it's\n\n409\n00:16:27.951 --> 00:16:28.800\n240.\n&gt;&gt; Look at\n\n410\n00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.640\nthat, cool.\n\n411\n00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.690\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; We like it.\n\n412\n00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:31.770\n&gt;&gt; So that's the good\n\n413\n00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:33.210\nthing about making sure\nyou have the links.\n\n414\n00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:36.150\nAnd since it's across the worksheet,\nyou'd probably want that to happen.\n\n415\n00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:39.980\nBut there's something else that happened,\ndo you see over here?\n\n416\n00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:42.280\nSee those little, sorry I know\nit's very small for you to see and\n\n417\n00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.370\nit's a little off on the screens\non these televisions.\n\n418\n00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:46.220\nYou're like,\nI have no idea what I'm looking at.\n\n419\n00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:50.100\nIt's right here, we have outlines, okay,\n\n420\n00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:53.930\nwe've talked about grouping and\noutlines in another episode.\n\n421\n00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:58.290\nSo what it did,\nis it went ahead and gave me all of\n\n422\n00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:02.860\nthe details of each one\nof those worksheet.\n\n423\n00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:06.418\nNow it just says consolidate, so\nit's not early giving you any great names.\n\n424\n00:17:06.418 --> 00:17:10.380\nThis is very much like doing subtotals,\ncuz that's kind of what it's doing,\n\n425\n00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:10.990\nisn't it?\n\n426\n00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:15.970\nWe're subtotaling all the mice, and\nthen the snake, and then the crinkle ball.\n\n427\n00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:18.540\nAnd so\nit's giving me all of the references from\n\n428\n00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:21.740\neach one of those worksheets\nin an outline form.\n\n429\n00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:25.232\nSo that's kinda cool too,\nwhile it does create links,\n\n430\n00:17:25.232 --> 00:17:28.860\nit also creates that summary and\nthe consolidation.\n\n431\n00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:32.670\nAnd you can choose your different levels\nof clicking on the one or the two,\n\n432\n00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:37.310\nto be able to get to the details or\njust the summary, neat.\n\n433\n00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:43.082\nSo the outlining and the links,\npretty cool, that's what consolidating\n\n434\n00:17:43.082 --> 00:17:48.870\ndoes just to show you that you can do it,\nyou can do it across workbooks.\n\n435\n00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:53.980\nIt does not limit you to just the same\nworkbook and just using your sheets.\n\n436\n00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:59.260\nSo we are going, notice I have January,\nFebruary, March of consolidating.\n\n437\n00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:02.210\nI'm going to open all\nof these up together so\n\n438\n00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:06.308\nyou can see that we have\na couple of different workbooks.\n\n439\n00:18:06.308 --> 00:18:10.712\nAnd I tried to color code them,\nI know this is really small, so\n\n440\n00:18:10.712 --> 00:18:14.798\nlet's zoom in on here and\nmake these a little bit bigger.\n\n441\n00:18:14.798 --> 00:18:19.760\nSo, here's March, okay,\nand then here is January.\n\n442\n00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:24.617\nAnd let's zoom in here and\nthen I'm gonna come up to window so\n\n443\n00:18:24.617 --> 00:18:29.070\nI can switch back and\nforth between my open workbooks.\n\n444\n00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:33.490\nAnd then here's February, so I tried to\nput the little label up at the top so\n\n445\n00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:35.120\nwe can just kind of color code them.\n\n446\n00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:40.237\nSo let's look at February, we have\nsome toys, still got the same stores,\n\n447\n00:18:40.237 --> 00:18:44.395\nwe have a bouncing ball,\na spiral, a jumping frog, right?\n\n448\n00:18:44.395 --> 00:18:47.910\nA heart mouse,\nbecause it's Valentine's day, right?\n\n449\n00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:49.145\nSuch just,\nprobably has hearts all over it.\n\n450\n00:18:49.145 --> 00:18:50.185\n&gt;&gt; Well these are cat toys\n\n451\n00:18:50.185 --> 00:18:50.900\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n452\n00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:52.010\n&gt;&gt; See I thought it was\n\n453\n00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:54.398\nlike a mouse that it could\npull the heart out of it.\n\n454\n00:18:54.398 --> 00:18:56.190\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Of course you would.\n\n455\n00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:57.139\n&gt;&gt; It's a cat,\n\n456\n00:18:57.139 --> 00:19:00.251\nit's not like cats play with mice for fun.\n\n457\n00:19:00.251 --> 00:19:03.275\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No they don't cause Bishop kills them.\n\n458\n00:19:03.275 --> 00:19:08.290\n[LAUGH] Yes, so and then over here,\nbut look at this one.\n\n459\n00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:10.915\nOkay, I'll read them for you.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, if you would.\n\n460\n00:19:10.915 --> 00:19:13.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So we have the snake wand,\n\n461\n00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:18.360\nthe crinkle ball that bounces by the, the\nheart mouse, and the bunny mouse in March.\n\n462\n00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:23.080\nOkay, but remember,\nback in February there's no bunny mouse\n\n463\n00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:23.777\nin-\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't exist.\n\n464\n00:19:23.777 --> 00:19:24.679\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't exist, right?\n\n465\n00:19:24.679 --> 00:19:25.880\n&gt;&gt; Not in this dojo.\n\n466\n00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.800\n&gt;&gt; No and if I look over at January,\n\n467\n00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:32.470\nwe just have the mouse, the snake,\nthe crinkle, the bouncy, and the spiral.\n\n468\n00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:34.990\nWait a second, what's going on here?\n\n469\n00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:38.412\nSo Daniel, what's going on here?\n&gt;&gt; If I'm not mistaken,\n\n470\n00:19:38.412 --> 00:19:39.793\nI'm following you here,\n\n471\n00:19:39.793 --> 00:19:44.760\nis that there are different categories\nbetween the workbooks, if that's correct?\n\n472\n00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:48.440\nSo that makes me think if I've got, you\nsaid before we have to have categories,\n\n473\n00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.800\nright, those are there.\n\n474\n00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.418\nBut if I have different ones cuz before\neverything had to be the same right, or\n\n475\n00:19:52.418 --> 00:19:53.970\neverything was the same at least.\n\n476\n00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:55.510\nNow you've got things that are different.\n\n477\n00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:59.220\nThat's leading me think that either a,\nit's gonna be just fine,\n\n478\n00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:00.140\nit's not gonna be a problem.\n\n479\n00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:02.963\nOr you're gonna go,\n[SOUND] wrong, you can't do that.\n\n480\n00:20:02.963 --> 00:20:06.072\nSo I'm gonna leave that to you.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a reason why I made\n\n481\n00:20:06.072 --> 00:20:07.885\nthe information different\non each workbook, yeah.\n\n482\n00:20:07.885 --> 00:20:12.018\n[LAUGH] And even more, look at this,\non this particular one on March,\n\n483\n00:20:12.018 --> 00:20:13.890\nwe have a Tampa store, right?\n\n484\n00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:18.252\nIf I switch back, and by the way I am\ndoing Cmnd+tilde to switch between open\n\n485\n00:20:18.252 --> 00:20:21.200\nworkbooks or\nany open windows in the application.\n\n486\n00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.835\nSo see in January,\nwe hadn't opened the Tampa store, so\n\n487\n00:20:24.835 --> 00:20:28.950\nthen in February we had the heart\nmouse which was not in January.\n\n488\n00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:34.100\nAnd then in March we opened the new store,\nand we added a bunny mouse.\n\n489\n00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.850\nOkay, so different ranges or\n\n490\n00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:41.610\ndifferent, yeah just different sizes of\nthe ranges that we're wanting consolidate,\n\n491\n00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:42.900\nand it's gonna be fine.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n492\n00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:44.010\n&gt;&gt; So that sounds good.\n\n493\n00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:47.890\nSo let's do a File &gt; New or\nCmd+N for a new workbook.\n\n494\n00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:51.330\nSo I'm gonna take all of these workbooks\nand put them all into this one.\n\n495\n00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.520\nAnd I'll put it right here on A1,\nsounds good, so\n\n496\n00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.586\nwe are going to go back to our data.\n\n497\n00:20:57.586 --> 00:21:01.161\nAnd we are going to go to Consolidate,\nand we're gonna sum it all up, and\n\n498\n00:21:01.161 --> 00:21:02.870\nwe are gonna go to our references.\n\n499\n00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:05.320\nAnd just like before,\nyou're gonna navigate to it.\n\n500\n00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:08.218\nHow do I get to that\nother workbook though?\n\n501\n00:21:08.218 --> 00:21:10.312\nJust, I think the easiest way.\n&gt;&gt; Click on it.\n\n502\n00:21:10.312 --> 00:21:12.402\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But I don't really have\n\n503\n00:21:12.402 --> 00:21:15.240\nit like right in front.\n&gt;&gt; It's not like immediately in your view\n\n504\n00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:18.950\nso, you either gotta get real strategic\nwith the placement of your windows or\n\n505\n00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:21.175\nyou've got a trick obviously.\n&gt;&gt; Just use Window menu,\n\n506\n00:21:21.175 --> 00:21:25.940\nyep there's a reason that one's there,\nand why I kind of alluded to it again.\n\n507\n00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:30.370\nYeah, let's go back to\nthe consolidate Jan workbook.\n\n508\n00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:35.260\nBring that up, now I will select that\nrange of cells, and there you go.\n\n509\n00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:39.120\nNotice the different syntax here,\nI'm a little scared to zoom in.\n\n510\n00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.940\nSo I'm just gonna tell it to you.\n\n511\n00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:45.761\nIt has angled brackets, and\nthat shows you the name of the workbook.\n\n512\n00:21:45.761 --> 00:21:48.414\nAnd then toys Jan with\nthe exclamation point,\n\n513\n00:21:48.414 --> 00:21:52.370\nthat indicates the name of the sheet,\nand then the cell references.\n\n514\n00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:55.484\nOkay, so there's a lot of kind\nof interesting syntax in there,\n\n515\n00:21:55.484 --> 00:21:56.590\ndon't be too scared.\n\n516\n00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:58.870\nAnd I forgot something else that happened.\n\n517\n00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:01.614\nThis isn't a bad thing, but\ndo you see how it just went,\n\n518\n00:22:01.614 --> 00:22:04.270\nwow what is it?\n&gt;&gt; It gave you the file\n\n519\n00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:05.717\npath.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n520\n00:22:05.717 --> 00:22:08.290\nwhy, do you know why it's doing that?\n&gt;&gt; Probably because it's a different\n\n521\n00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:10.500\nworkbook than the one you're already on.\n\n522\n00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:13.590\nYou have to know exactly where that thing\nlasts, because if it moves or whatever,\n\n523\n00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:16.238\nit's going to freak out.\n&gt;&gt; Yes and since this workbook,\n\n524\n00:22:16.238 --> 00:22:20.420\nthis is just a brand new workbook,\nI haven't saved this workbook\n\n525\n00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:22.420\nto the computer.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n526\n00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:25.470\nit doesn't know relative\npaths versus absolute paths.\n\n527\n00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:29.869\nSo that's why it's putting this whole\nuser's office pro, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n528\n00:22:29.869 --> 00:22:33.777\nYours might not see that, if you had\nalready saved the new workbook before you\n\n529\n00:22:33.777 --> 00:22:34.460\nstarted.\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n530\n00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:35.714\n&gt;&gt; Not that big of a deal,\n\n531\n00:22:35.714 --> 00:22:38.570\nbut this is again,\nremember what I said before?\n\n532\n00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:41.141\nSelect all this,\ndelete it once you've added it into your\n\n533\n00:22:41.141 --> 00:22:43.763\nreferences.\n&gt;&gt; Otherwise you get the giant string of\n\n534\n00:22:43.763 --> 00:22:48.670\ntext that makes no sense to you.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I'm telling you, just do it.\n\n535\n00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:50.884\nIt seems like an extra step,\nit'll make your life easier.\n\n536\n00:22:50.884 --> 00:22:53.535\nSo we're gonna go-\n&gt;&gt; Technically, it is an extra step.\n\n537\n00:22:53.535 --> 00:22:54.922\n[LAUGH] But it's well worth doing.\n\n538\n00:22:54.922 --> 00:22:56.410\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n539\n00:22:56.410 --> 00:23:01.156\nlet's move over to our February,\nsame thing, we will go ahead and select.\n\n540\n00:23:01.156 --> 00:23:04.477\nFrom here we will click the Add button,\neverything is,\n\n541\n00:23:04.477 --> 00:23:09.010\nI just clicked it again so I'll just\ntriple, I'm doing one, two, three.\n\n542\n00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:14.070\nTriple clicking to select that\nwhole paragraph if you wanna say.\n\n543\n00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:18.538\nAnd then we will come back,\nlet's get our last reference to March and\n\n544\n00:23:18.538 --> 00:23:21.900\nwe'll select this, and\nthen we will add it.\n\n545\n00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:25.110\nAnd if we scroll on over, see we have\ndifferent workbooks, different ranges.\n\n546\n00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:28.988\nThis is A4 through D10,\nthis is A4 through E11,\n\n547\n00:23:28.988 --> 00:23:32.740\nso we added another row and\nanother column.\n\n548\n00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:33.670\nIs everything gonna be okay?\n\n549\n00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:36.250\nMm-hm, we're gonna create\nlinks cuz we like that.\n\n550\n00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:38.628\nAnd we're gonna use the top row and\n\n551\n00:23:38.628 --> 00:23:43.488\nthe left column because that's\nthe stuff we wanna consolidate.\n\n552\n00:23:43.488 --> 00:23:46.170\nWe click OK and there you go,\n\n553\n00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:49.786\nlook at that, that's pretty cool and\nit went ahead and consolidated everything.\n\n554\n00:23:49.786 --> 00:23:54.341\nAnd notice how on this one,\nlike see it says jumping frog, and\n\n555\n00:23:54.341 --> 00:23:56.367\nthen in Tampa it's blank.\n\n556\n00:23:56.367 --> 00:24:02.660\nThat's because, if we go back to the March\nstore, right, there isn't any frogs.\n\n557\n00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:09.030\nLike we just took that toy off of the\ninventory, and so it's going to be blank.\n\n558\n00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:11.560\nSo it's pretty cool how\nit does all of that.\n\n559\n00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.820\nAnd then we can open up the details\nto see each one of them,\n\n560\n00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:18.440\nnotice it is using the workbook name for\nthem.\n\n561\n00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:24.180\nAnd so I consolidated all the information\nwith varying amounts of rows and columns.\n\n562\n00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:27.060\nAnd it went ahead and did that,\nso that's pretty cool.\n\n563\n00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:31.135\nI like the consolidate, I know it's\na little old school if you wanna say,\n\n564\n00:24:31.135 --> 00:24:33.125\nyou have the links and everything.\n\n565\n00:24:33.125 --> 00:24:37.160\nSo if you don't know how to\nuse advanced functions or\n\n566\n00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.130\nuse functions across workbooks.\n\n567\n00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:43.020\nThis is something that we didn't even\ntalk anything about how you're actually\n\n568\n00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:46.220\nperforming a function,\nwe just did it through the consolidate.\n\n569\n00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:49.780\nSo it's kinda cool, and a different\nway that you could go ahead and\n\n570\n00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:53.780\nsummarize all of your data, create your\nlinks, and do your outlines, okay?\n\n571\n00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:57.984\nBut again more concepts that we need\nto understand that these are outlines,\n\n572\n00:24:57.984 --> 00:25:01.720\nwe need to understand that it\nis performing a calculation.\n\n573\n00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.820\nBut other than that,\nthat's all you need to know.\n\n574\n00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:05.745\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's pretty straightforward,\n\n575\n00:25:05.745 --> 00:25:07.450\nI like it Vonne, I'm a fan.\n\n576\n00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:09.999\nLike yourself, yeah it might be\na little more of, like what you said,\n\n577\n00:25:09.999 --> 00:25:12.090\nold school method but,\ntried and true, it works right?\n\n578\n00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:16.189\nAnd it's easy to perform, it's easy to\nunderstand, which I always like as well,\n\n579\n00:25:16.189 --> 00:25:17.710\nand it gets the job done.\n\n580\n00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:19.544\nRight, so\nwho's to say it's the wrong way to do it,\n\n581\n00:25:19.544 --> 00:25:20.980\nthat's how I'm gonna do it from now on.\n\n582\n00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:24.339\nSo if you need to consolidate some\ninformation between your workbooks,\n\n583\n00:25:24.339 --> 00:25:28.414\nbetween your worksheets, or just inside of\nthe Excel spreadsheet that you're working\n\n584\n00:25:28.414 --> 00:25:32.035\nwith right there in front of you, well\nconsolidate might be the tool for you.\n\n585\n00:25:32.035 --> 00:25:33.526\nVonne, thanks so much for dropping by and\n\n586\n00:25:33.526 --> 00:25:35.239\nshowing us how we can use\nthe consolidate tool.\n\n587\n00:25:35.239 --> 00:25:37.920\nBut looking at our clock,\nwe are out of time for this episode.\n\n588\n00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.910\nSo thank you guys out there for watching.\n\n589\n00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:41.858\nWe're gonna sign off for\nOfficeProTV, I've been your host,\n\n590\n00:25:41.858 --> 00:25:42.594\nDaniel Lowrie.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n591\n00:25:42.594 --> 00:25:44.230\nI'm Vonne Smith.\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n592\n00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:48.012\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

It's going fantastic, and\nI'm ready to play out some scenarios.\n\n10\n00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:34.456\n&gt;&gt; Ooh.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n11\n00:00:34.456 --> 00:00:35.742\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna do charades.\n\n12\n00:00:35.742 --> 00:00:37.883\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I had to put the jazz hands up for\n\n13\n00:00:37.883 --> 00:00:39.191\nthat one for some reason.\n\n14\n00:00:39.191 --> 00:00:41.419\n&gt;&gt; You didn't jazz enough, though.\n\n15\n00:00:41.419 --> 00:00:46.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, so scenarios right,\n\n16\n00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.170\nokay, it's just like if I have this\nscenario the outcome would be X,\n\n17\n00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.400\nif I had that scenario\nthe outcome would be Y.\n\n18\n00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.260\nThat's exactly what we're gonna be\ndoing here, is just saying, hey,\n\n19\n00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.200\nif I change a couple of these values\nhow would it affect my bottom line.\n\n20\n00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.290\n&gt;&gt; I was going to say didn't\nwe kinda do this already?\n\n21\n00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.750\nI feel like I've been down\nthis road with you before.\n\n22\n00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.720\n&gt;&gt; A couple of these episodes seem\nlike we're on repeat honestly.\n\n23\n00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.880\n[LAUGH] Yeah, and this is part of\nour what-if analysis group of tools.\n\n24\n00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.530\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n25\n00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.020\n&gt;&gt; We did some data tables, and\nthen we have another one called\n\n26\n00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.180\nGoal Seek which we're going\nto actually do after this.\n\n27\n00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.950\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n28\n00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.900\n&gt;&gt; Were you with me with data tables,\nI can't remember?\n\n29\n00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.449\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I did data tables with you.\n\n30\n00:01:28.449 --> 00:01:30.177\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Which is why I remember\n\n31\n00:01:30.177 --> 00:01:31.449\ngoing we did this.\n\n32\n00:01:31.449 --> 00:01:32.844\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n33\n00:01:32.844 --> 00:01:35.006\n&gt;&gt; You remember, you were there [LAUGH].\n\n34\n00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:39.665\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, and again these\nare the slightly different ways\n\n35\n00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:43.147\nto maybe go ahead and\nget the same end result.\n\n36\n00:01:43.147 --> 00:01:47.176\n&gt;&gt; But, yes, this whole bottom line of how\nour bottom line is going to be affected.\n\n37\n00:01:47.176 --> 00:01:50.038\nTim talks about it a lot, our,\nthe owner here at ITProTV,\n\n38\n00:01:50.038 --> 00:01:52.559\nhe's always talking about\ndifferent scenarios.\n\n39\n00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:56.219\nWell, if we make this sales goal,\nand this other goal, and that thing,\n\n40\n00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.336\nwe're gonna do this and it's like okay.\n\n41\n00:01:58.336 --> 00:01:59.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Usually it ends up with us having\n\n42\n00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.035\na party or something where I'm like yay,\nI want a party.\n\n43\n00:02:02.035 --> 00:02:03.743\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Should I hire a band?\n\n44\n00:02:03.743 --> 00:02:06.250\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, yeah.\n\n45\n00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.290\nSo I mean and he's all about numbers and\neverything and that.\n\n46\n00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.370\nSo, I always hear him kind of talking\nabout this, and I'm always wondering like,\n\n47\n00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.905\nI wonder if he's using scenarios in Excel?\n\n48\n00:02:16.905 --> 00:02:18.921\nI don't think he is, but that's okay.\n\n49\n00:02:18.921 --> 00:02:21.395\n[LAUGH] He has other people do that for\nhim.\n\n50\n00:02:21.395 --> 00:02:24.628\nSo, but anyways, we're going to do that.\n\n51\n00:02:24.628 --> 00:02:26.384\nSo why don't we get an example and\n\n52\n00:02:26.384 --> 00:02:30.477\nlet's walk through some of the different\nthings we're talking about here.\n\n53\n00:02:30.477 --> 00:02:33.772\nSo, for example,\nwe have a monthly budget sheet.\n\n54\n00:02:33.772 --> 00:02:37.172\nWe have some personnel costs,\nwe have some expenses and\n\n55\n00:02:37.172 --> 00:02:40.032\nright just to show you what I have.\n\n56\n00:02:40.032 --> 00:02:42.455\nIt's just a quick little,\nwhoops that's the wrong cell.\n\n57\n00:02:42.455 --> 00:02:47.804\nThis is just a quick sum right, we are\njust summing up all of this information,\n\n58\n00:02:47.804 --> 00:02:51.305\nor this particular cell is\nsumming up these cells.\n\n59\n00:02:51.305 --> 00:02:56.114\nAnd this cell right here is, let's just go\nahead and escape that because I realize\n\n60\n00:02:56.114 --> 00:03:00.662\nI'm messing everything up, is just\nadding up this number plus this number.\n\n61\n00:03:00.662 --> 00:03:06.285\nSo our monthly operating budget\nconsists of our personnel expenses and\n\n62\n00:03:06.285 --> 00:03:07.979\nour other expenses.\n\n63\n00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:10.982\nOkay, cool, so just like our other things,\n\n64\n00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:14.690\nwe do have to have this based\non a formula or a function.\n\n65\n00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.270\nJust like when we're\ndoing our data tables,\n\n66\n00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.591\nit has to have some type of calculation or\n\n67\n00:03:18.591 --> 00:03:24.250\nform for you to start changing the values\nand doing that what-if analysis.\n\n68\n00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.493\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like algebra.\n\n69\n00:03:25.493 --> 00:03:27.632\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Like there's a variable and\n\n70\n00:03:27.632 --> 00:03:32.201\nif X changes to such and such,\nthat's basically what we're doing, right?\n\n71\n00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:33.213\n&gt;&gt; Pretty much, yeah.\n\n72\n00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:38.291\nSo for example, if we could get\nsome of our operational cost down.\n\n73\n00:03:38.291 --> 00:03:42.514\nMaybe move to another\nbuilding that has less rent,\n\n74\n00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:45.664\nyou can't take the catnip away, no.\n\n75\n00:03:45.664 --> 00:03:49.843\n&gt;&gt; If anything the budget increases,\nas the cats get more and\n\n76\n00:03:49.843 --> 00:03:51.670\nmore of a problem [LAUGH].\n\n77\n00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I mean,\nyou can't take away that, you know, so.\n\n78\n00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.340\nIt's those types of things and\nso you start changing numbers.\n\n79\n00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.590\nWe could go ahead and\nlike it will increase our sales and\n\n80\n00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.420\nthen we will decrease our manager's cost.\n\n81\n00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.650\nYeah cuz like a manager's\ngonna take a pay cut.\n\n82\n00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.749\nBut and then we'll change our\noperating cost to 5,000 and\n\n83\n00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:15.162\nwe'll come over here to our rent,\nthat will be another 5,000.\n\n84\n00:04:15.162 --> 00:04:18.470\nAnd like, okay, cool, but then you've\nlost track of what you've done, right?\n\n85\n00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.408\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's like, wait, but\n\n86\n00:04:20.408 --> 00:04:23.290\nthat wasn't,\nthat was just me kinda playing around.\n\n87\n00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.006\nSo you undo and all this kind of stuff and\n\n88\n00:04:25.006 --> 00:04:27.194\nthat's exactly what I'm\ndoing is just undoing.\n\n89\n00:04:27.194 --> 00:04:28.075\n&gt;&gt; Just undo crazy, yeah.\n\n90\n00:04:28.075 --> 00:04:33.109\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well it would be nice to\nhave these scenarios stored into,\n\n91\n00:04:33.109 --> 00:04:38.522\nwell, if we reduce our personnel cost,\nhow does this change things?\n\n92\n00:04:38.522 --> 00:04:41.184\nIf we reduce our expenses,\nhow does that change things?\n\n93\n00:04:41.184 --> 00:04:47.217\n&gt;&gt; So scenarios become a what-if that you\ntake a snapshot of and save it for later.\n\n94\n00:04:47.217 --> 00:04:49.142\n&gt;&gt; Snapshot is a perfect way to say that,\nyeah,\n\n95\n00:04:49.142 --> 00:04:51.283\ncuz we talk about that\nwith our virtual machines.\n\n96\n00:04:51.283 --> 00:04:52.081\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we do.\n\n97\n00:04:52.081 --> 00:04:56.960\n&gt;&gt; So perfect way that you're equating\nwhat we're doing, look at you.\n\n98\n00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.257\n[LAUGH] I give you a cookie.\n\n99\n00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:00.074\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n100\n00:05:00.074 --> 00:05:02.730\nthat's exactly what\nwe're going to do here.\n\n101\n00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:08.385\nSo, let's walk through\nthis particular example.\n\n102\n00:05:08.385 --> 00:05:13.517\nAnd I'll show you along the way\nwe're gonna that's not very good.\n\n103\n00:05:13.517 --> 00:05:17.486\nAnd then we'll back up and show you\nsomething else that we can perform on our\n\n104\n00:05:17.486 --> 00:05:21.401\ndata before we do our scenarios that's\ngonna make our lives a lot easier.\n\n105\n00:05:21.401 --> 00:05:24.479\nI know that was so vague,\nyou're like whatever [LAUGH].\n\n106\n00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.059\n&gt;&gt; Just do the thing, Vonne,\njust do the thing [LAUGH]\n\n107\n00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:29.372\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, okay, here let's go over to,\n\n108\n00:05:29.372 --> 00:05:32.029\nI have our scenarios worksheet.\n\n109\n00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:36.100\nI just, I have my notes cuz I have very\nspecific ways to like one sheet is\n\n110\n00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.860\ndifferent.\n\n111\n00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.670\nSo, if you see me looking down here,\njust to keep my self on track, right.\n\n112\n00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.030\nSo, I've gone over to a different work\nsheet cuz they all look the same, and\n\n113\n00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:48.540\nwe're gonna go over to our Data tab and\nwe're going to do our what-if, and\n\n114\n00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.970\nwe will do our scenario manager.\n\n115\n00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.108\nAnd then it opens up into here where\nit's telling us, well hey, guess what?\n\n116\n00:05:55.108 --> 00:05:59.686\nYou don't have any scenarios\nin this particular workbook or\n\n117\n00:05:59.686 --> 00:06:03.108\nworksheet, I should go ahead and\npoint out.\n\n118\n00:06:03.108 --> 00:06:06.816\nSo we're gonna add one,\nwe're gonna add one in here.\n\n119\n00:06:06.816 --> 00:06:10.777\nAnd then it goes in to, all right well\ntell me what you want this scenario to be.\n\n120\n00:06:10.777 --> 00:06:15.885\nWell, right now, we're just gonna say that\nthis is our test for this particular one.\n\n121\n00:06:15.885 --> 00:06:19.268\nAnd then we're gonna say,\nwell then, what do you wanna do?\n\n122\n00:06:19.268 --> 00:06:22.542\nIf I want to do this scenario,\nwhat do you want to change,\n\n123\n00:06:22.542 --> 00:06:24.350\nwhat cells are gonna change?\n\n124\n00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:29.860\nSo I'm gonna take the cursor out, or take\nanything out there, then move this over.\n\n125\n00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.802\nCursor's right here I wanna\nplay around with these numbers.\n\n126\n00:06:32.802 --> 00:06:36.859\nI wanna play around with this group of\nnumbers right, because all of these\n\n127\n00:06:36.859 --> 00:06:41.386\nnumbers are connected to this formula,\nwhich is also connected to this formula.\n\n128\n00:06:41.386 --> 00:06:46.078\nOkay, so these are like the precedents,\nright, the ones,\n\n129\n00:06:46.078 --> 00:06:50.409\nyeah, they're the ones that\nthe form is dependent on.\n\n130\n00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:51.987\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah, we get you.\n\n131\n00:06:51.987 --> 00:06:54.259\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and so we've got that, but\n\n132\n00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:59.338\nI also want to add in these numbers, too,\ncuz I wanna play around with all of them.\n\n133\n00:06:59.338 --> 00:07:02.067\nSo notice does command click to\nselect non adjacent cells, so\n\n134\n00:07:02.067 --> 00:07:05.070\ndon't forget to do that if you don't\nhave cells next to each other.\n\n135\n00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.290\nIf you just start selecting, it's just\ngonna replace it, so you don't want that.\n\n136\n00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:12.800\nSo let's hold our Cmd, we will select\nthis, so we have two ranges of cells,\n\n137\n00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.730\nI have B2 through B5 and F2 through F5.\n\n138\n00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:18.860\nYou should probably create comments for\nyourself.\n\n139\n00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.912\nBecause that way you'll remember,\nwhat is this particular scenario about?\n\n140\n00:07:22.912 --> 00:07:28.944\nI'm trying to reduce manager cost, and\ndecrease rent, and that's one scenario.\n\n141\n00:07:28.944 --> 00:07:31.358\nAnd then, you add another scenario\nthat's going to be something.\n\n142\n00:07:31.358 --> 00:07:36.538\nSo use your comments to your advantage,\nit's good to always add notes.\n\n143\n00:07:36.538 --> 00:07:42.117\nDown here this prevent changes and\nhide, these kinda don't mean anything.\n\n144\n00:07:42.117 --> 00:07:44.430\n[LAUGH] Then why'd you\neven give me the option?\n\n145\n00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:47.321\nThey don't mean anything\nunless you're actually\n\n146\n00:07:47.321 --> 00:07:51.027\ngoing to protect the whole worksheet,\nso it's a separate step.\n\n147\n00:07:51.027 --> 00:07:55.371\nIf these are checked on to\nprevent changes and hide, and\n\n148\n00:07:55.371 --> 00:08:00.700\nyou then do your workbook protection,\nthen those will apply.\n\n149\n00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.936\nOtherwise, if there's no sheet protection\nThey don't mean anything, okay, so.\n\n150\n00:08:04.936 --> 00:08:08.140\nBut, we do have something about document\nsecurity in this particular series.\n\n151\n00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:09.190\nSo check that out, and\n\n152\n00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:12.600\nthat will kind of make more sense\nif you're like, I don't understand.\n\n153\n00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.200\nThat's okay,\nyou don't really need to at this point.\n\n154\n00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:20.690\nSo we will click OK, and then it goes\nright into your scenario values.\n\n155\n00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:24.260\nAnd notice down here that it's saying,\nokay, well now you need to go ahead and\n\n156\n00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.420\nchange your values to say, just like\nwe were doing before when we were\n\n157\n00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:32.090\nchanging the individual cells to see\nwhat our monthly operating budget was.\n\n158\n00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:34.440\nAnd that's what their\nscenario is going to be.\n\n159\n00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.525\nBut notice, this is kind of confusing,\nright, what's B2, what's B-\n\n160\n00:08:37.525 --> 00:08:38.454\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know,\n\n161\n00:08:38.454 --> 00:08:42.540\nI'm looking at this going,\nI have no idea what's happening here.\n\n162\n00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:45.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right,\nbecause it doesn't mean anything to you.\n\n163\n00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.555\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Like, if I look B2,\n\n164\n00:08:47.555 --> 00:08:53.377\nB2 is really that one right here,\nthat's the manager's cost, right?\n\n165\n00:08:53.377 --> 00:08:56.060\nAnd then, B3, that is 15,000.\n\n166\n00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.940\nThat's our sales, right?\n\n167\n00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:01.010\nIf that said sales, you'd be okay,\nyeah, sales is 15,000.\n\n168\n00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:02.190\n&gt;&gt; Right, I would get it.\n\n169\n00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:02.870\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n170\n00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:08.390\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nthis is where I'm showing tip number one,\n\n171\n00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:12.330\nyou need to use named cells or\nnamed cell ranges.\n\n172\n00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.700\nOtherwise, it's not gonna make any sense.\n\n173\n00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:16.716\nWhat's that?\n\n174\n00:09:16.716 --> 00:09:17.760\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt;

This is why you have the base.\n\n330\n00:17:01.234 --> 00:17:02.023\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n331\n00:17:02.023 --> 00:17:04.720\n[LAUGH] So something to be aware of.\n\n332\n00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:09.214\nWhen you close that dialog box off,\nwhatever last Scenario you had shown,\n\n333\n00:17:09.214 --> 00:17:13.862\nthat's going to be the one that is\nthe one you're gonna keep in this\n\n334\n00:17:13.862 --> 00:17:15.524\nparticular workbook.\n\n335\n00:17:15.524 --> 00:17:16.604\nOr worksheet.\n\n336\n00:17:16.604 --> 00:17:19.761\nBecause scenarios are worksheet specific.\n\n337\n00:17:19.761 --> 00:17:24.741\nIf I come over here to the named sheet,\nI know they all look the same, but\n\n338\n00:17:24.741 --> 00:17:28.030\nI am on a different worksheet right now.\n\n339\n00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:32.674\nAnd I go into Scenarios,\nthere's nothing in here.\n\n340\n00:17:32.674 --> 00:17:33.681\nBut we did them all.\n\n341\n00:17:33.681 --> 00:17:35.450\nThat was on the monthly budget worksheet.\n\n342\n00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:37.110\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So they are specific.\n\n343\n00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:43.366\nI'm gonna do a very quick\none to show one other\n\n344\n00:17:43.366 --> 00:17:49.480\npoint we will do increase, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Increase.\n\n345\n00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:49.994\n&gt;&gt; Increase sales.\n\n346\n00:17:49.994 --> 00:17:50.575\n&gt;&gt; Sal-ays.\n\n347\n00:17:50.575 --> 00:17:53.880\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; By changing these cells, and\n\n348\n00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.184\nwe will click OK.\n\n349\n00:17:55.184 --> 00:17:56.440\nWe'll just do a quick one.\n\n350\n00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.833\nAnd we're gonna really up our sales.\n\n351\n00:17:57.833 --> 00:18:00.150\nWe're going 50,000, yeah!\n\n352\n00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:00.950\n&gt;&gt; Man, we're doing well.\n\n353\n00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:02.140\n&gt;&gt; I know, look at that.\n\n354\n00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.100\nAnd if we show it, woo yeah.\n\n355\n00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:05.630\nThat's way better, right?\n\n356\n00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:06.580\nWe want that.\n\n357\n00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:11.230\nSo I closed that and again now is\nthe scenario on this particular worksheet.\n\n358\n00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:15.880\nAnd so I have scenarios here and I have\nscenarios here on our two worksheets.\n\n359\n00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:20.530\nBut hey, I really like that other scenario\nthat I did on that other worksheet\n\n360\n00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:22.637\nthat's where you can merge them.\n\n361\n00:18:22.637 --> 00:18:26.197\nOkay, so I just wanna show you\nall the buttons in this and so\n\n362\n00:18:26.197 --> 00:18:30.300\nclick the dialogue box,\nif I go back to Scenario Manger.\n\n363\n00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:35.210\nThe Merge button right down here means\nthat it's going to merge scenarios from\n\n364\n00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:39.010\nother sheets and or workbooks.\n\n365\n00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:41.450\nSo if you played out all these values\n\n366\n00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:44.820\na lot of time to copy the worksheet\nmight try some other things.\n\n367\n00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:50.012\nSo, yeah, I wanna bring in the scenarios\nfrom this particular worksheet.\n\n368\n00:18:50.012 --> 00:18:50.985\nYou click OK.\n\n369\n00:18:50.985 --> 00:18:55.364\nNow it just becomes part of your\nscenarios in this worksheet, so\n\n370\n00:18:55.364 --> 00:18:58.385\nthat's what that particular button does.\n\n371\n00:18:58.385 --> 00:19:00.233\nAnd brings it from other places.\n\n372\n00:19:00.233 --> 00:19:02.411\nAnd then if you wanted to edit it right.\n\n373\n00:19:02.411 --> 00:19:05.910\nWe can't fire Bob we just realized\nwe can't do that he's on a-\n\n374\n00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:08.155\n&gt;&gt; He's the you know somebody's cousin or\n\n375\n00:19:08.155 --> 00:19:09.410\nsomething like that.\n\n376\n00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:10.994\n&gt;&gt; He's on the ten year track.\n\n377\n00:19:10.994 --> 00:19:12.580\n&gt;&gt; Nepitism is getting him in.\n\n378\n00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:13.505\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n379\n00:19:13.505 --> 00:19:15.419\nSo you could come in and edit this.\n\n380\n00:19:15.419 --> 00:19:17.665\nLike I need to edit my reduced personel.\n\n381\n00:19:17.665 --> 00:19:19.645\nSo let's go ahead and look at that.\n\n382\n00:19:19.645 --> 00:19:23.550\nAnd then we have to take our\nmanagers back up to 25 thousand.\n\n383\n00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:27.810\nAnd but our customer service,\nwe can get rid of Nancy, or whatever.\n\n384\n00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:31.400\nSo we can go ahead and\nreduce that by 5,000, that kind of thing.\n\n385\n00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.090\nSo you can use the Edit,\nyou can use the Merge.\n\n386\n00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:37.902\nAnd then the Show, we talked about where\nwe can go through our different scenarios.\n\n387\n00:19:37.902 --> 00:19:40.061\nSo probably like this one the best, right?\n\n388\n00:19:40.061 --> 00:19:40.700\n&gt;&gt; Mm.\n\n389\n00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:44.111\n&gt;&gt; Cool, but\nreally like the scenarios, but.\n\n390\n00:19:44.111 --> 00:19:48.930\nWouldn't it be nice to kind\nof see them side by side?\n\n391\n00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:50.915\nAll the different scenarios\nis next to each other so\n\n392\n00:19:50.915 --> 00:19:52.172\nwe can really kind of look at it.\n\n393\n00:19:52.172 --> 00:19:55.630\n&gt;&gt; The compare and contrast kind\nof thing that we all love so much.\n\n394\n00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:58.370\n&gt;&gt; What button do you think I'm going\nto click here to make that happen?\n\n395\n00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:02.112\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's see here,\nI'm gonna go with Close.\n\n396\n00:20:02.112 --> 00:20:05.294\n[LAUGH] I'm guessing maybe Summary.\n\n397\n00:20:05.294 --> 00:20:07.918\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna have to take that cookie away\n\n398\n00:20:07.918 --> 00:20:09.972\nfrom you so,\n[LAUGH] yes the Summary button.\n\n399\n00:20:09.972 --> 00:20:12.132\nSo I go ahead and click it.\n\n400\n00:20:12.132 --> 00:20:13.910\nThere's two different types.\n\n401\n00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:15.470\nI will show you both of them.\n\n402\n00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:21.809\nI tend to like the scenario summary the\nbest And results cells, we'll click OK.\n\n403\n00:20:21.809 --> 00:20:27.655\nAnd then it brings me to a whole\nother worksheet, isn't this neat?\n\n404\n00:20:27.655 --> 00:20:29.849\n&gt;&gt; Got all these pretty little colors.\n\n405\n00:20:29.849 --> 00:20:31.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right [LAUGH].\n\n406\n00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:33.990\nAnd so it shows you our current,\n\n407\n00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:37.760\nand remember the current one\nwas the one I left off on?\n\n408\n00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:38.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I probably\n\n409\n00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.550\nshould have put that to the base or\nwhatever.\n\n410\n00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:42.540\nBut I have one that says base value.\n\n411\n00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:43.960\nSo at least it's nice.\n\n412\n00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:47.580\nIt really depends on which way\nyou want to summarize your data.\n\n413\n00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.870\nBut it kinda just goes across and\nit puts the different names\n\n414\n00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:55.050\nof the scenarios that we did, and\nthen it gives a cost comparison.\n\n415\n00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:56.310\nWe can look at this.\n\n416\n00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:58.990\nAnd then it gives us some information over\n\n417\n00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:02.500\nhere to where it has our\ndifferent comments, that's cute.\n\n418\n00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.955\nSo it went ahead and\noutlined our information.\n\n419\n00:21:04.955 --> 00:21:07.060\nWhoops, we should probably go ahead and\nclick on that one.\n\n420\n00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:08.280\nAnd you have your collapsings.\n\n421\n00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:11.940\nIt's just, I just think this is\nsuch a cool tool to go ahead and\n\n422\n00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:15.000\ngive you different scenarios and\ngive you a summary of what you look like.\n\n423\n00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.850\nThis also reminds me of, you know the\nthings you get from your taxes every year?\n\n424\n00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:21.030\nWhere it says if this changes.\n\n425\n00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:22.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n426\n00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.886\nYeah, and this always reminds me of that.\n\n427\n00:21:23.886 --> 00:21:25.794\n&gt;&gt; I think of it like when\nyou go to websites and\n\n428\n00:21:25.794 --> 00:21:28.868\nyou're trying to purchase something,\nthis is a purchase website.\n\n429\n00:21:28.868 --> 00:21:30.580\nWell, I want this toothbrush.\n\n430\n00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.630\nLet's compare it to the other\ntoothbrushes in that price range.\n\n431\n00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:34.650\nThat's what I'm thinking of.\n\n432\n00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:37.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That data analysis kind of idea.\n\n433\n00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:40.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, you can see where\nour two brains are at right now.\n\n434\n00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.329\n&gt;&gt; Not that I care about,\nit could have been hats for all I care.\n\n435\n00:21:42.329 --> 00:21:45.095\n&gt;&gt; Well because I haven't filed\nmy taxes yet, so, I know, yeah.\n\n436\n00:21:45.095 --> 00:21:46.988\n&gt;&gt; You need to get on that, girl.\n\n437\n00:21:46.988 --> 00:21:48.253\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n438\n00:21:48.253 --> 00:21:51.272\n&gt;&gt; Today's like the April 4th so [LAUGH].\n\n439\n00:21:51.272 --> 00:21:52.887\n&gt;&gt; I got a little bit [LAUGH].\n\n440\n00:21:52.887 --> 00:21:55.255\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\nit's called an extension [LAUGH].\n\n441\n00:21:55.255 --> 00:21:59.156\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well yeah,\nI need to get cracking.\n\n442\n00:21:59.156 --> 00:21:59.795\n&gt;&gt;

I know but when I'm done it's all good.\n\n447\n00:22:05.616 --> 00:22:09.080\n[LAUGH] But I do like the scenarios and\nI like the summary, but\n\n448\n00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:13.900\njust to show you what the other\none will do with the pivot tables.\n\n449\n00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:15.920\nIt just doesn't give as much information.\n\n450\n00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:18.480\nSo the what if analysis.\n\n451\n00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.380\nWe go to Scenario Manager,\nwe go to Summary.\n\n452\n00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:23.470\nAnd I choose the pivot table.\n\n453\n00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:25.510\nAnd then it just, I don't know.\n\n454\n00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:26.024\n&gt;&gt; That's dumb.\n\n455\n00:22:26.024 --> 00:22:26.825\n&gt;&gt; It just doesn't yeah.\n\n456\n00:22:26.825 --> 00:22:28.566\n&gt;&gt; Don't use it.\n\n457\n00:22:28.566 --> 00:22:31.295\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I just,\nI don't like it as much.\n\n458\n00:22:31.295 --> 00:22:32.990\nI know that pivot tables are great.\n\n459\n00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:33.675\n&gt;&gt;

I know I'm scared.\n\n41\n00:01:48.135 --> 00:01:51.052\n[LAUGH] But it was one of those that is,\n\n42\n00:01:51.052 --> 00:01:55.680\nI don't wanna use scenarios\ncuz we just got done filming.\n\n43\n00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.340\n&gt;&gt; The scenraios,\n\n44\n00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.780\nit's scenarios, isn't it?\n\n45\n00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.640\n&gt;&gt; No, it's not.\n&gt;&gt; We knew it,\n\n46\n00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.050\nscenario episode, we've already seen this.\n\n47\n00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.582\n&gt;&gt; It's so hard not to use the terminology\nwhen I'm trying to explain this.\n\n48\n00:02:04.582 --> 00:02:05.929\nI talked about this another episode.\n\n49\n00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:08.605\n&gt;&gt; You hit the what if button?\n\n50\n00:02:08.605 --> 00:02:09.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n51\n00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:10.890\n&gt;&gt; She is.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's so hard.\n\n52\n00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.840\nBut what if I got this,\nwhat if I got that?\n\n53\n00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.360\nI'm trying to seek out the answer,\nI have the goal in mind.\n\n54\n00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.850\nI need to get an 89.5, and if I got\n&gt;&gt; So because you know what the goal is,\n\n55\n00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.960\nyou can extrapolate the steps you're\ngonna need to take to reach that goal.\n\n56\n00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.112\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and so if I got a 70,\nno okay what if I got a 72, no okay.\n\n57\n00:02:31.112 --> 00:02:36.310\nWhat if I got a 72, okay, I need a 74.5,\n\n58\n00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.580\nbecause I'm probably not that great at\nmath, I'm sure there is another way.\n\n59\n00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.530\nI probably could have done that, but it's\nlike we're just plugging the last number\n\n60\n00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.780\nuntil I found it, yes,\nthat's exactly what we're doing.\n\n61\n00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:48.280\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n62\n00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.575\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so we are not gonna do scores\non a test, we're gonna do sales,\n\n63\n00:02:54.575 --> 00:02:58.520\ncuz we're trying to keep it more\ntowards what you might be going for.\n\n64\n00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.840\nSo yes, we're gonna track some\nChristmas cart sales, now,\n\n65\n00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.900\nyou talked about a curve\nball in another episode.\n\n66\n00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.730\nOkay, there is the weirdest\ncurveball in this particular one.\n\n67\n00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.840\n&gt;&gt; This is like a knuckleball, it's\nlike it's floating all over the place.\n\n68\n00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.850\n&gt;&gt; It is, is that what they do?\n\n69\n00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:13.840\n&gt;&gt; A knuckleball, yeah.\n\n70\n00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.300\n&gt;&gt;

Really?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's crazy.\n\n75\n00:03:24.356 --> 00:03:28.630\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well, that's exactly what\nwe're going to encounter here.\n\n76\n00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:29.470\n&gt;&gt; And it's weird, so\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n77\n00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.760\n&gt;&gt; So I'll keep you in suspense\n\n78\n00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.520\non that one.\n\n79\n00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.590\nSo why don't I show you\nthe way it's supposed to work.\n\n80\n00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.280\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n81\n00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.920\n&gt;&gt; Then I'm gonna show you how\nit's completely broken, and\n\n82\n00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.020\nwhat breaks it,\nbecause we're using Office for\n\n83\n00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.860\nMac, and there's a really weird\nbug at the time of this recording.\n\n84\n00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.013\nSo if you do it and you're like hey,\neverything is fine,\n\n85\n00:03:50.013 --> 00:03:51.801\nhopefully we'll fix this one.\n\n86\n00:03:51.801 --> 00:03:52.726\n&gt;&gt; Have this fixed.\n\n87\n00:03:52.726 --> 00:03:54.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz this one is weird.\n\n88\n00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.600\nLet's get started, we are down here,\nI have my files ready and\n\n89\n00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.000\nI have goals seek and\nI'm going to open this up.\n\n90\n00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.510\nAnd here we go, we will take this,\nso here we go, we have some sales.\n\n91\n00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.740\nAnd Daniel, I forgot you're in this one,\nhere you go.\n\n92\n00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.345\n&gt;&gt; Hey, look at me, I'm a sales person.\n\n93\n00:04:11.345 --> 00:04:12.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n94\n00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.160\n&gt;&gt; And I'm fired, man, I'm fired [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, right here-\n\n95\n00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.790\n&gt;&gt; Or am I doing well?\n\n96\n00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.030\nWe're gonna find out.\n\n97\n00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.929\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n98\n00:04:19.929 --> 00:04:22.594\nthis is just a hard\ncoded number by the way.\n\n99\n00:04:22.594 --> 00:04:25.660\nI will just put in like our average goal,\nokay?\n\n100\n00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.848\nYou need to get an average of 40,\nacross all the sales for\n\n101\n00:04:29.848 --> 00:04:33.797\nChristmas cards in course one,\ntwo, three and four.\n\n102\n00:04:33.797 --> 00:04:36.064\nSo you got a 30, 45, 20, so\n\n103\n00:04:36.064 --> 00:04:41.720\nwhat do you need to get in quarter 4\nto achieve your sale, your average?\n\n104\n00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.400\nSo right now if I look in here,\nthis is just a simple calculation.\n\n105\n00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.690\nSo you can see that I have the average\nof these numbers B4 through E4.\n\n106\n00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.850\nAnd then we're gonna add them all up and\ndivide by how many we have, right?\n\n107\n00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.740\nBut you have nothing right now,\nthere's a 0, so\n\n108\n00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.950\nyour average at the current place is 32.\n\n109\n00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.680\nSo if I put in, let's just say,\n\n110\n00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.590\n20, well, then your average is 29,\nthat's not so good.\n\n111\n00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:08.460\n&gt;&gt; That's not gonna work.\n\n112\n00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.986\n&gt;&gt; No, if I put in 40, see, and\nthis is the things I would get.\n\n113\n00:05:10.986 --> 00:05:11.582\n&gt;&gt; Still doesn't happen.\n\n114\n00:05:11.582 --> 00:05:13.000\n&gt;&gt; 60, gosh.\n\n115\n00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.760\n&gt;&gt; Goodness gracious,\n\n116\n00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.450\nI've got some catch up to play [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right.\n\n117\n00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:16.620\nOoh, 70, 40, okay-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n118\n00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.146\n&gt;&gt; And\nthis is where I would circle it, okay?\n\n119\n00:05:20.146 --> 00:05:24.186\n68, okay, all right,\nyou can still load at 65, yeah, so\n\n120\n00:05:24.186 --> 00:05:26.110\nthis is the things I would do.\n\n121\n00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.650\n&gt;&gt; Right, what is the bare minimum so\nthat I won't lose my job?\n\n122\n00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.390\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yes.\n\n123\n00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.970\n&gt;&gt; So this is what we're\ngoing to do with Goal Seek.\n\n124\n00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:35.890\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; This is the-\n\n125\n00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.920\n&gt;&gt; So Goal Seek does that for us?\n\n126\n00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.080\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n127\n00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.606\nNow, it does work just like any other\nwhat if analysis, you have to have it\n\n128\n00:05:43.606 --> 00:05:46.924\nattached to [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Here's some information, but\n\n129\n00:05:46.924 --> 00:05:51.994\nthroughout that information, find out what\nI would need to get x, y, or z outcome.\n\n130\n00:05:51.994 --> 00:05:56.078\n&gt;&gt; Correct, well it's only one outcome,\nso there's not multiple variables.\n\n131\n00:05:56.078 --> 00:05:58.235\n[CROSSTALK] I know what you're saying,\nyeah.\n\n132\n00:05:58.235 --> 00:06:02.071\n[LAUGH] But just to clarify cuz we've\ntalked about data table with one or\n\n133\n00:06:02.071 --> 00:06:06.819\ntwo variables, and we've talked about some\nscenarios with all the different cells,\n\n134\n00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:08.720\nthis is very target specific.\n\n135\n00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.190\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; It's a very direct target,\n\n136\n00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.470\nyou can't really go much outside size,\nchange this,\n\n137\n00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:19.020\ngive me the end result here to be\nequal to that by changing this.\n\n138\n00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.830\nLet me show you, okay?\n\n139\n00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.030\nAll of this,\nyou have to have a calculation,\n\n140\n00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.800\nyou have to have a function or\na formula for this to work.\n\n141\n00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.050\nThis is why I want to have\nthis particular cell,\n\n142\n00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.460\nG4, to end up equaling 40\nby changing this cell.\n\n143\n00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.220\nThat's basically what we've been\nsaying the whole time, so let's do it.\n\n144\n00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.310\nI'm putting my cursor, to start, just\ncuz it makes it a little bit easier, so\n\n145\n00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:41.878\nlet's do it.\n\n146\n00:06:41.878 --> 00:06:44.750\nData, tab, what-if analysis,\n\n147\n00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:49.810\ngoal seek, set cell,\nthis is the cell I want to set, right?\n\n148\n00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:52.830\nG4, that's my average,\nthis is the thing that I want to,\n\n149\n00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:58.570\nthe format that I want to change\nto the specific value of 40.\n\n150\n00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.710\nNotice I have to hard code this,\n\n151\n00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.560\nthere is nothing in here that gives me\nan option to reference another cell.\n\n152\n00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:10.730\nSo you have to type in the value, and\nby the way we're also using whole numbers.\n\n153\n00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:14.530\nThese are all up to like that digit,\nnot like the decimals and\n\n154\n00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:15.200\neverything like that.\n\n155\n00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.020\nSo, just know if you had like decimals and\n\n156\n00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.885\neverything, this could be\na little bit differently.\n\n157\n00:07:20.025 --> 00:07:23.235\nSo I'm gonna set the value\nto 40 by changing what cell?\n\n158\n00:07:23.235 --> 00:07:27.455\nWe need to change your Quarter Four\nvalues, which is this cell right here.\n\n159\n00:07:27.455 --> 00:07:32.031\nSo that's what I'm saying,\nis these are the only parameters you have,\n\n160\n00:07:32.031 --> 00:07:35.052\nchange this to 40 by changing this cell.\n\n161\n00:07:35.052 --> 00:07:39.590\nYou click OK, and it will do its\nwhole [SOUND], and there you go.\n\n162\n00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:45.645\n65 is the amount of cells that you will\nhave to have in Q4 to not get fired.\n\n163\n00:07:45.645 --> 00:07:48.081\nSo,\n&gt;&gt; I got my works ahead of me here,\n\n164\n00:07:48.081 --> 00:07:51.668\nI've got to get to it,\nVonne, continue the show.\n\n165\n00:07:51.668 --> 00:07:55.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, and that's it,\nI mean that's exactly what happened.\n\n166\n00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.772\nNotice that nothing changed here, this\nis still your average, It went ahead and\n\n167\n00:07:59.772 --> 00:08:01.850\nfilled in that cell, and that's cool.\n\n168\n00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:05.018\nThe only thing with this is you have\nto do each one individually, so\n\n169\n00:08:05.018 --> 00:08:07.630\nit's not something like do it for\nall the rest of them-\n\n170\n00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:08.452\n&gt;&gt; Do it for all of them, yeah.\n\n171\n00:08:08.452 --> 00:08:12.263\n&gt;&gt; So I would have to come into here, and\nby the way I could start like somewhere\n\n172\n00:08:12.263 --> 00:08:14.880\nway out here,\nI don't have to start on the cell.\n\n173\n00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.264\n&gt;&gt; It just blows a little better\nfrom the way we look at things.\n\n174\n00:08:18.264 --> 00:08:22.081\n&gt;&gt; So let me show you that\nby not clicking there,\n\n175\n00:08:22.081 --> 00:08:25.310\nI'll go to this Goal Seek cell there.\n\n176\n00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:28.980\nSo now you see I've selected\nthe cell set it to the value of 40,\n\n177\n00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:33.210\nand then change this cell right here,\nyou click OK.\n\n178\n00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:36.580\nOkay, well, Alice did pretty good\ncuz she was doing pretty good, so\n\n179\n00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.346\nshe can kinda coast in quarter four.\n\n180\n00:08:38.346 --> 00:08:41.850\nYeah, that's nice, but\nnow she might be one where, hey,\n\n181\n00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:45.050\nyou get a bonus at 50, right?\n\n182\n00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:47.222\n&gt;&gt; Alice can sell the best leads\nby the way so [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH]\n\n183\n00:08:47.222 --> 00:08:48.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, yeah,\n\n184\n00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.950\nshe must be giving somebody some cookies.\n\n185\n00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:52.540\nLike, hey,\nwill you give me those good leads?\n\n186\n00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.832\nI'll bake you some nice\nchocolate chip cookies.\n\n187\n00:08:54.832 --> 00:08:56.104\n&gt;&gt; Alice.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n188\n00:08:56.104 --> 00:08:56.939\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n189\n00:08:56.939 --> 00:08:57.580\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n190\n00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.767\nthat's where you would have\nto perform it again, and\n\n191\n00:08:59.767 --> 00:09:05.120\nI'm just gonna do a few more for example's\nsake, but that's really all it is.\n\n192\n00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:10.970\nLike, set G, set the cell to a value\nof 50 by changing this cell.\n\n193\n00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:13.830\nClick OK, all right, well, hey, if you and\n\n194\n00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:18.450\nAlice get the same amount,\nshe gets a bonus and you don't, okay?\n\n195\n00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:19.680\nShe needs 65 to get 50.\n\n196\n00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.080\n&gt;&gt; It just says that she just\nneeds 40 to get a bonus, right?\n\n197\n00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.670\nSo anybody gets 40 or above.\n\n198\n00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:26.958\n&gt;&gt; 40 are fine, but bonus at 50.\n\n199\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.580\n&gt;&gt; Bonus at 50.\n\n200\n00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:32.446\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so can see that's\nwhat you would do, and you can do this for\n\n201\n00:09:32.446 --> 00:09:35.040\nany of them, you could go over here to.\n\n202\n00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:40.390\nHey, I want to set this,\nI wanna get the cost per toy to $2\n\n203\n00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:45.610\nby changing the amount of units I\nneed to order, that kinda of stuff.\n\n204\n00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:48.720\nRemember, this is the same example we\ndeal with our data tables where we change\n\n205\n00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.570\nall of this.\n\n206\n00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:55.210\nSo you can go different ways this again\nis what much more target specific.\n\n207\n00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:03.710\n&gt;&gt; Go ahead and set this to $2 by\nchanging how many units I have to order.\n\n208\n00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:08.380\nWow, I have to order basically 13750,\nokay, cool.\n\n209\n00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:12.660\nAnd the reason why this gave me\na decimal is because this cell is not-\n\n210\n00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:13.541\n&gt;&gt; Formatted.\n\n211\n00:10:13.541 --> 00:10:16.280\nYeah, you remembered, so over here,\n\n212\n00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:21.190\nthese were already formatted as general,\nso it just proved me wrong.\n\n213\n00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:21.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n214\n00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:24.970\nanyways, it's numbers\nbecause this is a number.\n\n215\n00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:29.080\nAnyway, results may vary based\non your number formatting.\n\n216\n00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.975\nOkay, same thing with loans,\nI think you get the idea here.\n\n217\n00:10:32.975 --> 00:10:36.940\nJust quickly, this one is\nslightly different only because\n\n218\n00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:41.810\nof the particular type of function\nthat it is doing, it's a PMT function.\n\n219\n00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.700\nPMT will always give you\na result in a negative format,\n\n220\n00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.470\nbecause it's like a payment\nthat's coming out of your money.\n\n221\n00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:49.160\n&gt;&gt; Got you.\n\n222\n00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:55.750\n&gt;&gt; So if I was going to say like, hey,\nI know I can afford $250 a month on a car\n\n223\n00:10:55.750 --> 00:11:00.860\npayment, all right,or whatever you're set\nthis is how much car can I buy, right?\n\n224\n00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:04.052\nI remember doing this, too, basically\nI just go to the bank and ask them.\n\n225\n00:11:04.052 --> 00:11:06.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH\n&gt;&gt; But then I said, well,\n\n226\n00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:10.690\nlet me Goal Seek,\nI wanna set this particular payment\n\n227\n00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:15.510\nto a value of 250,\nnotice I put a negative in there.\n\n228\n00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:18.880\nOkay, if you can't see it, I did put\na negative in there because I wanna\n\n229\n00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.820\nkeep within the way that the particular\nfunction is going to do this.\n\n230\n00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:27.506\nSo if you did that as a positive, it might\ngive you a completely different result, so\n\n231\n00:11:27.506 --> 00:11:30.180\njust be aware of what's going on here.\n\n232\n00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:33.560\nBy changing this amount and\nthen, all right, well,\n\n233\n00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.730\nI can afford a car that's 13,000.\n\n234\n00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:39.418\nThat's not much of car, but anyway-\n&gt;&gt; You kidding me, you can get a great car\n\n235\n00:11:39.418 --> 00:11:42.010\nfor 13 grand [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know that is true.\n\n236\n00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:43.880\n&gt;&gt; I'll take you shopping one day girl.\n\n237\n00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:49.120\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah.\n\n249\n00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.030\n&gt;&gt; It seemed to work, right?\n\n250\n00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:18.910\n&gt;&gt; You'd clicked run, they did things and\nyou did't go, why is this happening?\n\n251\n00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:20.650\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So I assumed it was working.\n\n252\n00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.140\n&gt;&gt; Okay, while preparing for this show,\n\n253\n00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:28.470\nI did this about 15 times,\nwhat is going on here?\n\n254\n00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:29.270\nJust mess-\n&gt;&gt; See,\n\n255\n00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:30.980\nthat's when you know\nthings aren't working.\n\n256\n00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:33.490\n&gt;&gt; Messed up beyond belief,\nI was doing it, and\n\n257\n00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:36.270\nit was giving me completely wrong numbers.\n\n258\n00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:41.250\nThere's no way that this is the result,\nlike the one that you had, what, 45 or?\n\n259\n00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:41.930\n&gt;&gt;

going?\n\n10\n00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.660\n&gt;&gt; It's going fantastic.\n\n11\n00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.810\nHow are you doing today?\n\n12\n00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.655\n&gt;&gt; I hate that question.\n\n13\n00:00:31.655 --> 00:00:34.129\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz do you really want me to answer or\n\n14\n00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:35.449\nyou just want me to make small talk?\n\n15\n00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:36.180\n&gt;&gt; Just make small talk.\n\n16\n00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.658\n&gt;&gt; It's going great.\n\n17\n00:00:37.658 --> 00:00:40.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Love life, fantastic.\n\n18\n00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.300\nActually, it is pretty good.\n\n19\n00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.630\nSo glad to be on the show with you, cuz I\nknow we're gonna do some cool Excel stuff\n\n20\n00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.480\nthat we probably never even knew\nwas a thing that we could do.\n\n21\n00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.345\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz that's what we do every time you\n\n22\n00:00:48.345 --> 00:00:49.380\ncome on the show so.\n\n23\n00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.510\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's funny you say that,\n\n24\n00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.358\nbecause this is the show that\nwe've actually done this before.\n\n25\n00:00:54.358 --> 00:00:55.561\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Kind of,\n\n26\n00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:58.730\nit's just in a different wrapper and\nall that kinda stuff.\n\n27\n00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.080\nThe title of this episode\nis Remove Duplicates.\n\n28\n00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.199\nAnd if you've watched some\nof these other episodes, and\n\n29\n00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.683\nyou've been with me on one of these,\nwhere we did tables, right?\n\n30\n00:01:06.683 --> 00:01:07.730\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n31\n00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.950\n&gt;&gt; We talked about Remove Duplicates.\n\n32\n00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.279\n&gt;&gt; Right-click Delete, done.\n\n33\n00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:12.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Or the little button.\n\n34\n00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.328\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for watching.\n\n35\n00:01:13.328 --> 00:01:14.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Click Delete Duplicates, yeah.\n\n36\n00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.220\n&gt;&gt; Or\nthe button that said Remove Duplicates.\n\n37\n00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.616\nYeah, exactly.\nSo I was like okay, so\n\n38\n00:01:18.616 --> 00:01:20.090\nwe're doing this again.\n\n39\n00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.550\nAnd we also talked about this\nin conditional formatting.\n\n40\n00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.030\n&gt;&gt; Did we?\n&gt;&gt; You weren't in that episode.\n\n41\n00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.808\n&gt;&gt; I got you.\n&gt;&gt; But yeah,\n\n42\n00:01:24.808 --> 00:01:26.082\n[LAUGH] maybe in the PC version.\n\n43\n00:01:26.082 --> 00:01:28.866\n&gt;&gt; Maybe, yeah, I've done a few\nof these with Vonne last time.\n\n44\n00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:31.472\nThis is all starts planning the other,\nright?\n\n45\n00:01:31.472 --> 00:01:32.211\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it does a little bit.\n\n46\n00:01:32.211 --> 00:01:36.435\n[LAUGH] But I wanted to dedicate a whole\nepisode on this particular topic.\n\n47\n00:01:36.435 --> 00:01:41.510\nWant to just review it and\nput it in its own box, if you wanna say.\n\n48\n00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.060\nAnd also show you another way that\n\n49\n00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.920\nI haven't shown you that also lends\nitself to another episode as well.\n\n50\n00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.280\nSo lots of cross referencings,\nlots of overlaps.\n\n51\n00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.124\nBut hey, if you're looking specifically\nfor how do I remove duplicates,\n\n52\n00:01:56.124 --> 00:01:57.412\nyou come to right place.\n\n53\n00:01:57.412 --> 00:02:00.738\nSo we're going to show you\nthe three different ways that\n\n54\n00:02:00.738 --> 00:02:03.090\nwe're going to do remove duplicates.\n\n55\n00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.929\n&gt;&gt; I didn't know there was even two ways,\nlet alone three.\n\n56\n00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:07.890\n&gt;&gt; Well, there's probably a couple more.\n\n57\n00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.003\nBut I figured-\n&gt;&gt; You said, fellas, keep it simple.\n\n58\n00:02:10.003 --> 00:02:12.100\n&gt;&gt; I've limited to these three ways.\n\n59\n00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.005\nThere's one when we go ahead and\nthe use the Remove Duplicates command.\n\n60\n00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:18.360\nWhich I just mentioned when\nwe did format as tables.\n\n61\n00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.814\nBut it's actually where you don't\nhave to have it formatted as a table.\n\n62\n00:02:21.814 --> 00:02:23.170\nTurn them to duplicates.\n\n63\n00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.600\nBut it's still the same commands.\n\n64\n00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.716\nSo there's nothing special about it.\n\n65\n00:02:25.716 --> 00:02:28.830\nReally quickly for those that may\nbe just jumping into this episode,\n\n66\n00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:29.804\ndefine a duplicate.\n\n67\n00:02:29.804 --> 00:02:30.910\nDuplicate what?\n\n68\n00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.376\n&gt;&gt; Duplicate would be the same.\n\n69\n00:02:32.376 --> 00:02:33.460\n&gt;&gt; Of anything?\n\n70\n00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.297\n&gt;&gt; Of anything, yes.\n&gt;&gt; Got you, so you see two and\n\n71\n00:02:35.297 --> 00:02:38.980\nthey shouldn't be there,\nthere should only be one.\n\n72\n00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.181\nThat's a duplicate we wanna get rid of it.\n\n73\n00:02:40.181 --> 00:02:44.030\n&gt;&gt; For example,\nlet's say we have a mailing list, right?\n\n74\n00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.022\nI do not want to have a duplicate\naddress there for the same person,\n\n75\n00:02:49.022 --> 00:02:53.672\nsame address, same city,\nsame zip, cuz I don't want that.\n\n76\n00:02:53.672 --> 00:02:54.910\nAnd it happens, right?\n\n77\n00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.049\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n&gt;&gt; Or maybe I can not have duplicate order\n\n78\n00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.090\nnumbers.\n\n79\n00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.010\n&gt;&gt; There's just no way that\nwe're allowed to have that.\n\n80\n00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.520\nSo I need to make sure that I can\n\n81\n00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.008\nquickly be able to find a duplicate\nbased on certain criteria that I set.\n\n82\n00:03:09.008 --> 00:03:13.900\nAnd then well, do whatever I want\nwith it whether I want to remove it,\n\n83\n00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.030\nwhich would mean remove duplicates.\n\n84\n00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.310\nOr maybe I just wanna highlight it.\n\n85\n00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.630\nI just wanna see the duplicates,\nand that's-\n\n86\n00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.090\n&gt;&gt; Get a little glance?\n\n87\n00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.845\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, give me some type\nof formatting that's gonna say hey,\n\n88\n00:03:25.845 --> 00:03:27.271\nthis is a duplicate value.\n\n89\n00:03:27.271 --> 00:03:30.840\nThat's where we can do the second way,\nwhich is the conditional formatting.\n\n90\n00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.310\nAnd that's just a showing.\n\n91\n00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.250\nIt's not actually removing.\n\n92\n00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.921\nAnd then the last way we're going\nto do it is I'm gonna show you with\n\n93\n00:03:36.921 --> 00:03:38.543\nsomething known as an advanced filter,\n\n94\n00:03:38.543 --> 00:03:41.277\nwhich is something we haven't done\nin this particular series yet.\n\n95\n00:03:41.277 --> 00:03:44.130\nSo those are the ways\nwe're gonna go about it.\n\n96\n00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.190\nSo why don't we get this party started and\nopen up the file?\n\n97\n00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.940\nBecause that's actually something\nI forgot to do before we started.\n\n98\n00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.820\nSo I have my Finder window.\n\n99\n00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.880\nLet's go to the file\ncalled Remove Duplicates.\n\n100\n00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.880\nLet's make this a little bit bigger,\nso we can see it.\n\n101\n00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.211\nZoom in and I've got a couple of\nworksheets across the bottom for\n\n102\n00:04:03.211 --> 00:04:05.586\ndifferent ways that we're\ngoing to be doing this.\n\n103\n00:04:05.586 --> 00:04:10.250\nAlrighty, so\nI just have a freeze on the first row\n\n104\n00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.350\nhere to show you that we have just looks\nlike somewhat like a mailing list.\n\n105\n00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.938\nAnd I want to make sure that I\ndon't have any duplicate values.\n\n106\n00:04:18.938 --> 00:04:21.190\nNow, I'm gonna point them out to you,\nso you can see them.\n\n107\n00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.855\nSee in rows 5, 6 and 7, Seva?\n\n108\n00:04:23.855 --> 00:04:26.623\n&gt;&gt; Seva.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, I was looking at Sasha and\n\n109\n00:04:26.623 --> 00:04:27.462\nI saw a seven.\n\n110\n00:04:27.462 --> 00:04:29.090\nSo I kinda blended them together.\n\n111\n00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.993\n&gt;&gt; So it's two.\n\n112\n00:04:29.993 --> 00:04:32.126\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So we're lucky we didn't get Sheva.\n\n113\n00:04:32.126 --> 00:04:33.509\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n114\n00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:35.508\nSo we got here, Mr. Sasha Kent.\n\n115\n00:04:35.508 --> 00:04:37.300\nHe's in here three times.\n\n116\n00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.640\nSasha was one of my first kitties.\n\n117\n00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.880\n&gt;&gt; Aww.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, he was a Russian Blue.\n\n118\n00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.257\nThat's why he lives in-\n&gt;&gt; I have a Russian Blue.\n\n119\n00:04:42.257 --> 00:04:43.544\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n&gt;&gt; That's what I have right now, yeah.\n\n120\n00:04:43.544 --> 00:04:45.300\n&gt;&gt; They're great cats.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, she's a great cat.\n\n121\n00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.351\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so that's why he lives at\nMoscow Boulevard, cuz he's a Russian Blue?\n\n122\n00:04:49.351 --> 00:04:50.155\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty KGB.\n\n123\n00:04:50.155 --> 00:04:54.149\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And he was named after-\n&gt;&gt; Just to poison the water board, people.\n\n124\n00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:56.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What crazy cat do you have, woman?\n\n125\n00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.515\n&gt;&gt; Well, actually, I just named off of\nmy best friend whose name was Sasha.\n\n126\n00:04:59.515 --> 00:05:00.955\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh, unlikely story.\n\n127\n00:05:00.955 --> 00:05:03.162\nNow, we never heard-\n&gt;&gt; You're starting to scare me, okay?\n\n128\n00:05:03.162 --> 00:05:04.189\nLet's keep going, all right?\n\n129\n00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:09.955\n[LAUGH] But we also have Kimbo Lyon and\nI think there's other one in here.\n\n130\n00:05:09.955 --> 00:05:10.956\nPaul West.\n\n131\n00:05:10.956 --> 00:05:14.765\nPaul, that's just a silly name for a cat.\n\n132\n00:05:14.765 --> 00:05:16.615\nSo we've got all of these ones.\n\n133\n00:05:16.615 --> 00:05:17.652\nI want to remove the duplicates.\n\n134\n00:05:17.652 --> 00:05:20.935\nAgain, if you've watched the tables\nepisode, you've seen this before.\n\n135\n00:05:20.935 --> 00:05:26.785\nBut we're not going to format this as\na table, like we did in that episode.\n\n136\n00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:31.660\nWe're just gonna go straight to the Data\ntab and go to Remove Duplicates,\n\n137\n00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.920\nit's right there.\n\n138\n00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.636\nIt's like okay, cool.\n\n139\n00:05:33.636 --> 00:05:38.080\nNow, I have put my cursor somewhere\nin this range of continuous data.\n\n140\n00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.640\nSo as soon as I click on\nthat Remove Duplicates,\n\n141\n00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.980\nit's going to select that\nrange of information and\n\n142\n00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:51.150\npull up the Remove Duplicates,\njust like the tables episode.\n\n143\n00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.538\nOkay, so now this is a weird one.\n\n144\n00:05:52.538 --> 00:05:54.383\n[LAUGH] I think I found a bug.\n\n145\n00:05:54.383 --> 00:05:57.030\nI have no idea why it's doing it.\n\n146\n00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.150\nI went out and looked,\nI couldn't find any answers.\n\n147\n00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.070\nDo you see how it says my\nlist has headers, right?\n\n148\n00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.622\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n149\n00:06:04.622 --> 00:06:08.270\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well, and then it says column A,\ncolumn B, column C.\n\n150\n00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.200\nIt's like no, those are headers.\n\n151\n00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.320\nSo why don't you pulling the headers?\n\n152\n00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.540\n&gt;&gt; Good question.\n\n153\n00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.518\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, okay?\n&gt;&gt; I guess, column A would be first.\n\n154\n00:06:18.518 --> 00:06:20.920\n&gt;&gt; First, yes.\nOkay, so I'm thinking all right,\n\n155\n00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.240\nwhat is this going on here?\n\n156\n00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.020\nSo I checked it.\n\n157\n00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.080\nWatch, if I go over to Home.\n\n158\n00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.133\nRemember, we did that our sorting filters.\n\n159\n00:06:27.133 --> 00:06:30.030\nYou weren't on that episode,\nbut notice it's pulling it.\n\n160\n00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.580\nThere's our column names.\n\n161\n00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.960\nSo in the sorting filters,\nit was doing fine.\n\n162\n00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.462\nEverything was fine.\n\n163\n00:06:35.462 --> 00:06:38.050\nIf I format this as a table, right?\n\n164\n00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.450\nEven if I go and format this is a table.\n\n165\n00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:41.055\nYeah, I have headers.\n\n166\n00:06:41.055 --> 00:06:42.920\nYep, okay, we're cool, right?\n\n167\n00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.801\nAnd in the table tab,\nwe also have removed duplicates, but\n\n168\n00:06:46.801 --> 00:06:49.760\nit's still picking out column A, column B.\n\n169\n00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:50.950\nI don't know.\n\n170\n00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I did my Office updates.\n\n171\n00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.310\nI'm on the latest update,\nwhich actually fixed.\n\n172\n00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:58.607\nRemember in the Goal Seek episode,\nthat weird-\n\n173\n00:06:58.607 --> 00:07:00.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the Dropbox problem?\n\n174\n00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's fixed for right now.\n\n175\n00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.810\n&gt;&gt; For now.\n\n176\n00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.890\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\nI have no clue why this is doing it, okay?\n\n177\n00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.540\nThis doesn't do it on the PC version.\n\n178\n00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.430\nMaybe my Mac is just having a bad day.\n\n179\n00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:12.010\n&gt;&gt; Could be.\n\n180\n00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.250\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\nSo for\n\n181\n00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:18.400\nnow, you're just gonna have to live\nwith it being column A and column B,\n\n182\n00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.870\nbecause I don't know other\nreason why it is doing it.\n\n183\n00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.589\nMaybe yours is doing it just fine.\n\n184\n00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:25.910\nRoll with it, okay?\n\n185\n00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:31.376\nSo we're going to pretend that my list\nheaders are showing, A, B, you know.\n\n186\n00:07:31.376 --> 00:07:34.030\nFirst, last, department,\nand everything like that.\n\n187\n00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.233\nSo you're just gonna choose\nwhat criteria you want\n\n188\n00:07:37.233 --> 00:07:40.445\nthe duplicates to meet if\nI have them all selected.\n\n189\n00:07:40.445 --> 00:07:48.782\nThat means, every single column has to\nbe the same for the multiple records.\n\n190\n00:07:48.782 --> 00:07:52.695\nSo the one with the Sasha cat,\nwith sales and phone number.\n\n191\n00:07:52.695 --> 00:07:56.766\nThat means, every single one has to match.\n\n192\n00:07:56.766 --> 00:07:58.666\nAs opposed to pumpkin.\n\n193\n00:07:58.666 --> 00:08:03.690\nThere might be two pumpkin squashes but\nthey're in different departments.\n\n194\n00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:06.540\nWell if they're in different departments\nthen that's not gonna meet the duplicate\n\n195\n00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:09.090\ncriteria so it won't remove them.\n\n196\n00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:12.230\nAnd other key word there, remove.\n\n197\n00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:16.960\nIt is going to search and take them out.\n\n198\n00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.600\nYou don't have any other things besides,\n\n199\n00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.510\nwhen I click okay it just\nsays hey I found them.\n\n200\n00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.500\nThere was four duplicate values.\n\n201\n00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:30.500\nI removed them which means you\nhave 22 unique values remaining.\n\n202\n00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.770\nCool, okay, and then that's where it is.\n\n203\n00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:38.240\nSo it just does it for you, if you're like\nI don't wanna see anything beforehand, you\n\n204\n00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.460\ndo the work Excel, find me the duplicates\nand then go ahead and get rid of them.\n\n205\n00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:48.160\nCool, all right, I just had to say\ngoodbye and not even think of it.\n\n206\n00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.260\nSo that is something that you can do, you\ndon't have to form it as a table first.\n\n207\n00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:56.800\nAnd just for examples that we talked about\nwith unique students versus enrollments\n\n208\n00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.550\nin that table episode.\n\n209\n00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:01.310\nIf you wanted to go ahead and\nsay, all right,\n\n210\n00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:06.220\nI want to remove if it has first and\nlast name, but not the course,\n\n211\n00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.580\nbecause that would mean I would have,\nI believe there's 26.\n\n212\n00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:14.010\nThere's 26, yep the count is 26,\nenrollments, but\n\n213\n00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:15.600\nI need the unique students.\n\n214\n00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.480\nSo this is one where I would click\nsomewhere in my range, go ahead and\n\n215\n00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.710\nclick Remove Duplicates.\n\n216\n00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:24.300\nOops, you know what,\nI only had two cells selected, so\n\n217\n00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.730\nit's asking me to go ahead and\nexpand the selection.\n\n218\n00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:29.380\nWhich is what I want to go ahead and do.\n\n219\n00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:32.990\nSo honestly, let's just cancel that,\nclick there and there we go.\n\n220\n00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.180\nStill not pulling up column headers,\nnot sure.\n\n221\n00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.740\nBut I know that I do not\nwant the course to match.\n\n222\n00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:42.060\nSo I'm going to say,\nas long as their first and\n\n223\n00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:46.290\nlast name are the same,\ngo ahead and remove them.\n\n224\n00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:52.010\nSo Jack is enrolled in three courses,\nbut he is only one student,\n\n225\n00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:56.710\nso if I click okay, again it's removing\nit, it found the duplicate values,\n\n226\n00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:02.090\nremoved those out, and\ngave me 15 unique values remaining.\n\n227\n00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:07.550\nCool, so again, it doesn't have to be all\nof them, you set the column criterias\n\n228\n00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:11.760\nfor what is a duplicate or not.\n\n229\n00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.340\nCool, but again, total removal.\n\n230\n00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:21.580\nConditional formatting is a way that you\ncan search out your duplicate values,\n\n231\n00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:24.430\nbut all I wanna do is just like,\nkinda mark them.\n\n232\n00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:25.400\nJust show me,\n\n233\n00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:30.310\ngive me a visual representation of\nwhere there are duplicate values.\n\n234\n00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:36.430\nThe only kicker in this one is\nthat you can't just go ahead and\n\n235\n00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:41.090\ndo a Ctrl+A or Cmd+A here and say, yeah,\n\n236\n00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:45.830\nlet's go over to conditional formatting\nand give me the duplicate values.\n\n237\n00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:54.320\nWell, it is, but you see how\nit's not doing the whole record,\n\n238\n00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.030\nokay, when you say,\nit would all have to the same.\n\n239\n00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:59.990\nNo, it's just going ahead,\nyou're saying every single column.\n\n240\n00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:03.460\nSo it's looking at this column and\nfinding duplicates, this column and\n\n241\n00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:07.890\nfinding duplicates, this column and\nfinding duplicates.\n\n242\n00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:12.120\nSo it doesn't work the way you would think\n\n243\n00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:16.640\nof the whole thing as one entire record or\nrow.\n\n244\n00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:21.660\nOkay, it's looking in the column, so\nthis doesn't achieve maybe exactly what\n\n245\n00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:28.220\nyou want to do if you're looking at\nthis one row as one whole value, okay.\n\n246\n00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:35.440\nBut what you can do is you\ncan pinpoint what area or\n\n247\n00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.240\nrange of cells that you\nwant to find duplicates.\n\n248\n00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.540\nFor example, in this one,\norder numbers, right?\n\n249\n00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:44.980\nI cannot have two order numbers.\n\n250\n00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:48.770\nAnd the other thing is, I don't want\nit to just find it and remove it.\n\n251\n00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:53.970\nBecause I can't kind of like actually\nlook at the data like why do I have\n\n252\n00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:55.300\nto order a 103.\n\n253\n00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:59.730\nSo okay so this is gonna be more\nof a you're getting a visual for\n\n254\n00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:06.230\nyou then to analyze and\ndetermine what went wrong.\n\n255\n00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:07.000\nThat's hard to say.\n\n256\n00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.560\n&gt;&gt; It's a lot w's.\n\n257\n00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.490\n&gt;&gt; I had a really slow down on that one.\n\n258\n00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:13.780\nAll right.\nSo this gets more into just give me\n\n259\n00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:18.720\na little help, and I'll determine\nwhat I need to do based on that.\n\n260\n00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.770\nSo I will select this column right here,\nthis information.\n\n261\n00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:28.450\nCome into conditional formatting, and\nI want to highlight any duplicate values.\n\n262\n00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:30.200\nSo I click here.\n\n263\n00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:33.840\nAnd notice that it's just going into\nformatting with unique or duplicates.\n\n264\n00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.890\nBecause I could choose one of the two.\n\n265\n00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:38.890\nFind the duplicates or\njust give me the unique values.\n\n266\n00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:42.970\nYou can determine which way\nis going to be best for you.\n\n267\n00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:45.210\nI'm gonna go with duplicates.\n\n268\n00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:46.770\nAnd you can pick whatever formatting.\n\n269\n00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:48.960\nI'm just gonna go with the default,\nthat's fine.\n\n270\n00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.940\nSo then it's just, that's all it is.\n\n271\n00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:53.100\nIt's a visual reference or\n\n272\n00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:57.480\na highlighting of there are duplicates\nhere and duplicates here.\n\n273\n00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.660\nAnd that's where I can come in and\nlook and say okay,\n\n274\n00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:03.930\nwell now, what's going on\nwith this particular order?\n\n275\n00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:06.630\nMaybe there is a reason why,\nyou know what?\n\n276\n00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:11.650\nThat was supposed to be 103-1 or\nsomething because it's same\n\n277\n00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:15.310\norder with a different company,\nbut it can't have the same number.\n\n278\n00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:16.690\nI'm just making stuff up, anyways.\n\n279\n00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:17.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n280\n00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:18.700\n&gt;&gt; But that's where you can say,\n\n281\n00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:19.600\nall right, perfect.\n\n282\n00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.930\nAnd if you had a lot of\ninformation going on here,\n\n283\n00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:26.870\nthen what you could is something\nlike go ahead and do a custom sort.\n\n284\n00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:33.250\nAnd then sort this particular\ncolumn by the Cell Color,\n\n285\n00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:37.980\nand go ahead and put the notice, yeah,\nthe Cell Color, yeah, that's what I want.\n\n286\n00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:43.580\nAnd I wanna go ahead and put,\nyou know what, why isn't this working?\n\n287\n00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.450\nWell,-\n&gt;&gt; You forgot something?\n\n288\n00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:46.890\n&gt;&gt; Do you know why Daniel?\n\n289\n00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:47.526\n&gt;&gt; I don't.\n[LAUGH]\n\n290\n00:13:47.526 --> 00:13:48.038\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n291\n00:13:48.038 --> 00:13:48.980\n&gt;&gt; Actually I do,\n\n292\n00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:52.130\nI just want to see if Vonne knows.\n\n293\n00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:52.830\n&gt;&gt; I love that one.\n\n294\n00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:53.941\nI use that a lot too.\n\n295\n00:13:53.941 --> 00:13:55.104\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n296\n00:13:55.104 --> 00:13:59.650\nI'm trying to sort by the first column,\nby cell color.\n\n297\n00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:01.560\n&gt;&gt; They're not colored.\n\n298\n00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.080\n&gt;&gt; It's wrong column.\n\n299\n00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.390\nI wanna sort by the order number.\n\n300\n00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:07.390\n&gt;&gt; It's order number.\n\n301\n00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:09.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's-\n&gt;&gt; It's like computers they count,\n\n302\n00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.570\nthey start with zero, right?\n\n303\n00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:12.800\nIt's weird.\n\n304\n00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:17.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you gotta actually pick\nthe right column that you wanna sort by,\n\n305\n00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:19.991\ncuz I'm like,\nwhy aren't you giving me any Cell color.\n\n306\n00:14:19.991 --> 00:14:23.069\n&gt;&gt; Because I want the first column,\nnot the first column,\n\n307\n00:14:23.069 --> 00:14:26.999\nthe column that is first in line on\nthe left, which is the order number.\n\n308\n00:14:26.999 --> 00:14:30.603\n&gt;&gt; And since there wasn't any cell\ncolor in the column named first,\n\n309\n00:14:30.603 --> 00:14:32.110\nit wasn't giving it to me.\n\n310\n00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:34.597\nBut now, I can go ahead and\nsort them by that.\n\n311\n00:14:34.597 --> 00:14:38.447\nAnd that gives me all the ones that\nhave duplicates at the top, and\n\n312\n00:14:38.447 --> 00:14:42.017\nthen you can make your determination of,\nchange the value,\n\n313\n00:14:42.017 --> 00:14:44.530\ndelete the row, all that kind of stuff.\n\n314\n00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:50.350\nSo again this way, it's a visual and\nthen you determine what's next.\n\n315\n00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:52.910\nYou do have to pick the column and\n\n316\n00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:56.680\nfigure out what you want to do\nyour conditional formatting with.\n\n317\n00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:57.480\nCool.\n\n318\n00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.820\nNow this one,\nthis next one I kind of like it, OK.\n\n319\n00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.430\nIt's a little old school.\n\n320\n00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:08.230\nOkay, there's a lot of steps, but,\nit seems like a lot of steps.\n\n321\n00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:10.300\n&gt;&gt; Get ready to hit the pause\nbutton a bunch of times so\n\n322\n00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.100\nyou can write these steps down.\n\n323\n00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.860\n&gt;&gt; We have episode notes for you!\n\n324\n00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:14.580\n&gt;&gt; Nevermind.\n\n325\n00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:15.830\nJust watch the fun.\n\n326\n00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:16.610\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n327\n00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:22.000\nBut it's really more of like just\ndifferent ways of like, hey, I need\n\n328\n00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.280\nto be able to look at this information and\nmake determinations of what’s going on.\n\n329\n00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:29.260\nI mean, this is analyzed data, right.\n\n330\n00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:33.020\nSo let’s talk about this advanced filter.\n\n331\n00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:36.775\nOkay so,\nwhat is an advanced [LAUGH] filter?\n\n332\n00:15:38.025 --> 00:15:41.477\n&gt;&gt; It's a filter that takes advanced\noptions other than the normal filter.\n\n333\n00:15:41.477 --> 00:15:42.135\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n334\n00:15:42.135 --> 00:15:46.475\nI know, my gosh, come on Vonne.\n\n335\n00:15:46.475 --> 00:15:49.940\n[LAUGH] But it's on our Data tab,\nand it's in our advance.\n\n336\n00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.200\nNow, we did sort and filter.\n\n337\n00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:55.337\nThis is another place where you can\njust click the button, and it gives you\n\n338\n00:15:55.337 --> 00:15:59.472\nthe drop-downs of all the cool things\nwe can do to go ahead and say, yeah,\n\n339\n00:15:59.472 --> 00:16:04.102\nI only want to filter out and see just the\ndeveloper and the marketing department.\n\n340\n00:16:04.102 --> 00:16:08.024\nCool, anytime you have a filter\nit goes ahead and like,\n\n341\n00:16:08.024 --> 00:16:12.790\nit's not necessarily, well it hides,\nbut it also filters it's.\n\n342\n00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:16.800\nOkay, what you're like\nwhat are you saying.\n\n343\n00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.410\n&gt;&gt; I'm waiting for the kicker here.\n\n344\n00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:22.340\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, the reason why I'm trying\nto use the proper terminology is\n\n345\n00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.980\nyou can come over here and hide rows.\n\n346\n00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.360\nRight, if I hide rows.\n\n347\n00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.350\nYou see this with hiding,\nis a little bit different than this.\n\n348\n00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:34.370\n&gt;&gt; Where it's like collapsed.\n\n349\n00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:36.690\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and color.\n\n350\n00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:37.920\n&gt;&gt; Do you see how these are blue?\n\n351\n00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthere's like a little color in it.\n\n352\n00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.000\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nIf you have blue colored rows,\n\n353\n00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.180\nyou have filtered information.\n\n354\n00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:46.905\nYes, it's hiding, but it's also filtered.\n\n355\n00:16:46.905 --> 00:16:48.214\nSo that's where.\n\n356\n00:16:48.214 --> 00:16:51.951\n&gt;&gt; So it's saying it's not necessarily\nbeing hid per se, but it's been filtered,\n\n357\n00:16:51.951 --> 00:16:54.185\nso now you know why that\nsays it's all drop down?\n\n358\n00:16:54.185 --> 00:16:57.415\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and it is hidden, but not really.\n\n359\n00:16:57.415 --> 00:17:00.480\n[LAUGH] See I'm spinning in circles, guys.\n\n360\n00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.280\nThis, not blue, okay?\n\n361\n00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:06.120\nYes, there is a line to let you know\nthat there are rows that are hidden.\n\n362\n00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:10.368\n&gt;&gt; It's not hidden, but you can't see it\ndue to the obfuscation by the program.\n\n363\n00:17:10.368 --> 00:17:14.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH], exactly.\n\n364\n00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:14.905\n&gt;&gt; Which means it's hidden.\n\n365\n00:17:14.905 --> 00:17:15.460\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n366\n00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:20.960\nthat's the biggest difference with\nwhat we're talking about with filters.\n\n367\n00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.960\nAnd the other thing is if I clear\na filter, then everything comes back.\n\n368\n00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.830\nAnd everything's back\nin the black numbers.\n\n369\n00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:29.850\nIf I come down to here again,\nI still got hidden rows.\n\n370\n00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:33.450\nSo the clear doesn't unhide.\n\n371\n00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:38.803\nI'd have to come into here, and\nthen unhide the rows that I had hidden.\n\n372\n00:17:38.803 --> 00:17:39.344\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n373\n00:17:39.344 --> 00:17:41.510\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so that's why it's.\n\n374\n00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:46.090\n&gt;&gt; What it is is, this is what happens\nin computers from time to time.\n\n375\n00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:49.430\nThey come up with a term that\nbecomes the thing,right?\n\n376\n00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:53.480\nSo they use the word hidden\nto have a specific meaning.\n\n377\n00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.960\nAlthough you are getting the same effect\nthrough what Vonne is showing you,\n\n378\n00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.510\nit's not technically hidden.\n\n379\n00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:01.680\nIf you're talking about\nthe program itself.\n\n380\n00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.480\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly perfect,\nbeautiful, done.\n\n381\n00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.547\nOkay, so\nlet's talk about advanced filters.\n\n382\n00:18:07.547 --> 00:18:11.912\n[LAUGH] So I'm gonna turn off\nthe filters just because, and\n\n383\n00:18:11.912 --> 00:18:14.240\nI go into my advanced filters.\n\n384\n00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:19.057\nNow the advanced filters, it's kind\nof like the conditional formatting,\n\n385\n00:18:19.057 --> 00:18:24.038\nin the sense that you need to select the\ninformation that you want to filter by.\n\n386\n00:18:24.038 --> 00:18:28.100\nI'm gonna give you the scenario,\nsee I'm using that again.\n\n387\n00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:32.363\nWe have scenarios differently in Excel,\n[NOISE] regular scenarios, okay.\n\n388\n00:18:32.363 --> 00:18:35.499\nWhere I have this list, and\nI need to look at this,\n\n389\n00:18:35.499 --> 00:18:40.280\nby the way this is just the same\nthing as the unique students, okay.\n\n390\n00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:43.410\nI want to examine these first two columns.\n\n391\n00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:45.020\nI want to say, if the first and\n\n392\n00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:49.940\nlast name matches, then go ahead and\nmark that as a duplicate.\n\n393\n00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:53.680\nI don't want to include the course, okay?\n\n394\n00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:58.030\nNow if I wanted to include all three and\nhave them all be duplicate,\n\n395\n00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:01.228\nlike we did on the whole\nrecord has to duplicate.\n\n396\n00:19:01.228 --> 00:19:02.160\nOkay, that's fine.\n\n397\n00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.760\nNo, I only want these first two columns.\n\n398\n00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:11.250\nSo you do need to select the information\nthat you want to filter by.\n\n399\n00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:13.630\nSo that's why I'm getting\nthese first two columns.\n\n400\n00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:18.020\nDo be slightly careful though,\nbecause if I come into my Advanced Filter,\n\n401\n00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:21.438\nlook at where the running ants go, okay.\n\n402\n00:19:21.438 --> 00:19:24.864\nMy running ants on this particular\none is going from A1 through C7.\n\n403\n00:19:24.864 --> 00:19:29.380\nSo it found the range,\neven though I told it, hey,\n\n404\n00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:34.610\nI only want to do the first two columns,\nall right?\n\n405\n00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:37.710\nIf you continued on with what I'm gonna\nshow you with the next steps with\n\n406\n00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:40.780\nthis particular list range,\nit's not going to work, okay.\n\n407\n00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:42.170\nSo be slightly careful.\n\n408\n00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:45.420\nIt might grab it the first time,\nand you're fine.\n\n409\n00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:49.634\nIf it doesn't,\nyou need to get rid of this, come out and\n\n410\n00:19:49.634 --> 00:19:53.500\nsay I only want you to look\nat the first few columns.\n\n411\n00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:59.814\nPut the green running ants around\nthat particular area, okay?\n\n412\n00:19:59.814 --> 00:20:01.473\nNow we are gonna do this\nfilter the list in place.\n\n413\n00:20:01.473 --> 00:20:04.414\nThere's some actually really cool things\nyou can do with advanced filters.\n\n414\n00:20:04.414 --> 00:20:07.976\nWe're not gonna get into them in this\nparticular episode, I'll make another one.\n\n415\n00:20:07.976 --> 00:20:13.204\nBut this one we are doing specifically\nfor, hey I want to do the whole duplicate.\n\n416\n00:20:13.204 --> 00:20:17.090\nFind my duplicates, and then I can\ndetermine what I want to do with them.\n\n417\n00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:19.080\nSo filter the list in place, and\n\n418\n00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:23.610\nyou wanna check this box off right here,\nunique records only.\n\n419\n00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:27.510\nThink about what that means,\nonly give me the ones that are unique.\n\n420\n00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:31.360\nSo then take out or filter the duplicates.\n\n421\n00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:33.420\nOkay cool.\n\n422\n00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:37.320\nBased on these two columns,\nclick OK, and it did it, right?\n\n423\n00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:43.220\nSo you can see that I have got\na couple different things going on.\n\n424\n00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:47.070\nThe same thing we did with our\nregular filters, I've got blue rows.\n\n425\n00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:49.540\nIf you have blue it's filtered, okay?\n\n426\n00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:53.420\nWe've got some hidden and now remember,\nwe saw that there was three Jack bow ties?\n\n427\n00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:54.900\nNow there's only one, okay?\n\n428\n00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.840\nAnd everything is filtered out.\n\n429\n00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:59.620\nOkay, cool, it did not remove.\n\n430\n00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:06.960\nIt just took them out and\nhid them [LAUGH] And now I have got this.\n\n431\n00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.570\nOkay, well that's pretty cool.\n\n432\n00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:13.030\nIt's just gonna ahead and\nhide them and great.\n\n433\n00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:16.000\nSo well then what else can I do with this?\n\n434\n00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.789\nOkay, I'm gonna do the exact same thing\non this one, I have specific examples.\n\n435\n00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:22.337\nSo, give me one second.\n\n436\n00:21:22.337 --> 00:21:24.690\nSo watch, let's do the whole thing again.\n\n437\n00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:25.930\nSelect these columns.\n\n438\n00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:28.517\nWe're going to go over\nto our advanced filter.\n\n439\n00:21:28.517 --> 00:21:32.660\nThis one it didn't go ahead and\nselect all of this.\n\n440\n00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:34.600\nSee, sometimes it works,\nsometimes it doesn't.\n\n441\n00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:35.370\nWhatever.\n\n442\n00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:37.230\nWe're going to click the unique records.\n\n443\n00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:40.069\nWe're clicking OK.\nSo now you can see that it did the same\n\n444\n00:21:40.069 --> 00:21:41.400\nthing.\n\n445\n00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:41.940\nFilter it out.\n\n446\n00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:42.700\nWe've got blue ones.\n\n447\n00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:45.080\nOkay, so great.\n\n448\n00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.190\nNow what else?\n\n449\n00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:47.510\nWhat am I gonna do with this?\n\n450\n00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:49.740\nLet me show you.\n\n451\n00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:53.330\nSo the next step is we're\ngoing to select all of these.\n\n452\n00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:55.650\nSo all I did was a Cmd+A.\n\n453\n00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:59.280\nAnd I'm going to fill\nin the cell color with,\n\n454\n00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.620\nlet's just do a light green or\nwhatever, okay?\n\n455\n00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:07.312\nGreat, so\nnow all of these are our unique records,\n\n456\n00:22:07.312 --> 00:22:10.905\n[LAUGH] and that's green.\n\n457\n00:22:10.905 --> 00:22:16.710\nWhen you come back over to your Data tab,\nand then you clear the filter,\n\n458\n00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:20.970\nnow what you have are all those hidden or\nfiltered out rows.\n\n459\n00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:23.250\nAll of those are not green.\n\n460\n00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:27.150\nSo now, green is unique, the white is not.\n\n461\n00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:31.990\nSo now what you can do is then come in and\nlook at this information.\n\n462\n00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:35.281\nOkay, Sasha Cat's in here three times,\nwhy?\n\n463\n00:22:35.281 --> 00:22:36.670\nLook at its address.\n\n464\n00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:42.240\nIn one place, we have 1333,\n123, 123 street Boulevard.\n\n465\n00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.140\nOkay, wait, you know what?\n\n466\n00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:48.110\nThis is just maybe like user input,\nerror or whatever.\n\n467\n00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:48.840\nLike something.\n\n468\n00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:49.930\nSomeone didnt type it in right.\n\n469\n00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:52.850\nSo this is actually the correct one.\n\n470\n00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:58.010\nThis is the correct address,\nthese two are wrong, okay?\n\n471\n00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:00.250\nSo this is again where it's more manual.\n\n472\n00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:05.220\nIt's like, I needed help determining\nfinding where the duplicates were.\n\n473\n00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:08.940\nAnd then I needed to come back in\nstart analyzing the data to say,\n\n474\n00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:10.280\nthat's the right one.\n\n475\n00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.000\nDon't just take it out.\n\n476\n00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.340\nGive me some type of formatting and\nthen I can determine it.\n\n477\n00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:20.040\nSo what I would do is then come over here,\nand make a like, a new column.\n\n478\n00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.740\nWe can name it Remove.\n\n479\n00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:24.878\nAnd then I just go through and\nsay, all right,\n\n480\n00:23:24.878 --> 00:23:29.317\nthis is the one I need to remove,\nand I'm just putting a Y in here.\n\n481\n00:23:29.317 --> 00:23:31.660\nThis is the correct one,\nthis is the wrong one.\n\n482\n00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.450\nI think I just flipped it,\ndidn't I say that the street one?\n\n483\n00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:34.030\n&gt;&gt; You did.\n\n484\n00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:36.010\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nwe'll just go ahead and do this.\n\n485\n00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:37.940\nThere we go, perfect.\n\n486\n00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:41.960\nOkay, so I'm just kinda going through\neach one, and then I have to determine,\n\n487\n00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.370\nwhy is Kimba in here twice.\n\n488\n00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:47.150\nOkay, see advertising is spelled wrong.\n\n489\n00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:47.674\n&gt;&gt; Got you.\n\n490\n00:23:47.674 --> 00:23:48.400\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n491\n00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:51.207\n&gt;&gt; So it's the little things that could\ncause these duplicate records and\n\n492\n00:23:51.207 --> 00:23:53.792\nnow you can be I just need to filter\nout the ones that I don't need.\n\n493\n00:23:53.792 --> 00:23:55.950\nAnd then we can get rid of them,\ncuz I know they're no good.\n\n494\n00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:57.856\nKeep the ones that are great,\nand you're off to the races.\n\n495\n00:23:57.856 --> 00:24:00.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but it's again,\nI have to determine that.\n\n496\n00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:01.560\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And sometimes the ones.\n\n497\n00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.901\n&gt;&gt; Cuz the program doesn't know,\nit just knows it's a duplicate Yeah, and\n\n498\n00:24:03.901 --> 00:24:05.327\nif I had just said, remove them-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n499\n00:24:05.327 --> 00:24:06.720\n&gt;&gt; I would've never been able to see.\n\n500\n00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:09.640\n&gt;&gt; And,\ndid it make the right choice at removal?\n\n501\n00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:13.770\nThat's the big thing, is,\ndo you trust that machine to go, well,\n\n502\n00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:14.940\nthis is the right one.\n\n503\n00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:16.910\nHow does it know that?\n\n504\n00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:17.410\nIt doesn't.\n[LAUGH]\n\n505\n00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:18.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's why,\n\n506\n00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:21.190\nthis seems a little old school,\nand we got a couple extra steps.\n\n507\n00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:22.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We had to do, okay, let's filter.\n\n508\n00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:24.860\nNow, let's format, then let's clear it.\n\n509\n00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:26.760\nLet's go make another column.\n\n510\n00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:30.180\nBut these are things that you need to do\nif you have to comb through your data and\n\n511\n00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:31.250\nknow what's going on.\n\n512\n00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:34.000\nNow this one is like,\nwhy is there a pumpkin squash?\n\n513\n00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.210\nWhat's going on here?\n\n514\n00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:37.260\nWhy?\n\n515\n00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:40.940\nWait a second, I didn't filter or\nI didn't sort my list.\n\n516\n00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:42.930\nSee, there is pumpkin squash.\n\n517\n00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:45.910\nRemember we only said,\ntake the first and last.\n\n518\n00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:46.690\nSo then I'd have to,\n\n519\n00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:51.470\nthis might be one where I was like,\nokay let's go ahead and do a sort.\n\n520\n00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:52.910\nLet's sort A to Z.\n\n521\n00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:59.970\nLet's find, okay now I can see pumpkin\nis not in sales, he is in marketing.\n\n522\n00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:04.710\nMarketing is the correct one, sales is\nthe wrong one, so remove this one and so\n\n523\n00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:05.450\non and so forth.\n\n524\n00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:07.910\nDo you see how I'm going through.\n\n525\n00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:10.460\nHere's Paul West, different team.\n\n526\n00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:15.520\nHe's on team red so the blue is wrong,\nso on and so forth.\n\n527\n00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:19.600\nGreat, you go through all of this and\nthen you can go ahead and\n\n528\n00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:23.680\nsort by the remove, get all of these.\n\n529\n00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.460\nThese are the ones that need to go away.\n\n530\n00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:28.010\nTake all these rows.\n\n531\n00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:31.760\nDelete them and\nnow take this column out over here.\n\n532\n00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.860\nLet's just go ahead and\nremove this column there.\n\n533\n00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:36.070\nDo a command A.\n\n534\n00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:38.140\nFill this all back in with nothing.\n\n535\n00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:39.940\nAnd now I went ahead.\n\n536\n00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:41.840\nI removed the duplicates.\n\n537\n00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:45.960\nBut I was helped along the way with\nthat advanced filter in place.\n\n538\n00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.730\nFormatting and all those things.\n\n539\n00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:52.040\nSo it's more manual but\nsometimes you have to,\n\n540\n00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:55.371\nlike you said,\nyou shouldn't always trust your computer.\n\n541\n00:25:55.371 --> 00:25:57.894\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It can mess you up sometimes.\n\n542\n00:25:57.894 --> 00:26:00.495\n&gt;&gt; When we say sometimes\nwe mean every time.\n\n543\n00:26:00.495 --> 00:26:01.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n544\n00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.170\nExactly, so\n\n545\n00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:07.310\nagain that whole thing like why is it not\none of my calls better than the first one.\n\n546\n00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:08.360\nI don't know,\n\n547\n00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:13.110\ndo you want to trust this computer\nthat can't even find a header row?\n\n548\n00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:15.865\nWow, I'm really selling\nExcel right now aren't I.\n\n549\n00:26:15.865 --> 00:26:19.730\n[LAUGH] Anyways, it's just some different\nways for you to be able to determine where\n\n550\n00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:24.870\nyour duplicates are, how you want\nto work with them; remove them,\n\n551\n00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:28.610\njust look at them, analyze it and\nthen I will manually delete them.\n\n552\n00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:30.700\nSo couple cool ways and there you go.\n\n553\n00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:31.470\n&gt;&gt; Well good stuff Vonne.\n\n554\n00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:34.810\nWe thank you for dropping by and showing\nus how we can delete duplicate records cuz\n\n555\n00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:37.270\nthey're obviously superfluous and\nunnecessary.\n\n556\n00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:39.200\nAnd now we can,\nactually a couple different ways.\n\n557\n00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.420\nMaybe you want to trust the computer more,\nit's not vital information.\n\n558\n00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:45.580\nSo if you accidentally delete\na legit record, not a big deal.\n\n559\n00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:47.390\nBut if it's a little more like,\n\n560\n00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:49.530\nwe've gotta make sure that the good\nrecords don't go anywhere,\n\n561\n00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:53.560\nwe can more manually parse these things\nusing the last method which it shows.\n\n562\n00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:54.960\nGreat stuff, thanks for dropping by.\n\n563\n00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.420\nBut I'm looking at the clock,\nwe're out of time for this episode so\n\n564\n00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:59.350\nwe'll call it a day for Office Pro TV.\n\n565\n00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:00.790\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n566\n00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:01.420\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n567\n00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:02.370\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n568\n00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:07.991\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.880\n&gt;&gt; I thought mint chocolate ice cream-\n\n18\n00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.102\n&gt;&gt; Who doesn't it's\n\n19\n00:00:42.102 --> 00:00:42.854\ndelightful-\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n20\n00:00:42.854 --> 00:00:43.407\nIt's so good.\n\n21\n00:00:43.407 --> 00:00:44.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n22\n00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.310\nOkay.\nSo\n\n23\n00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.440\nit's funny you say matching forward In\nour series, [LAUGH] this is almost like\n\n24\n00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.290\nwe're taking a little step back in time.\n&gt;&gt; Something we've done\n\n25\n00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.070\nbefore.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n26\n00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.190\nAnd in a different way,\nand a totally more manual\n\n27\n00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.545\nin an old school way.\n&gt;&gt; Excellent.\n\n28\n00:01:01.545 --> 00:01:03.720\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n29\n00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's one of those things that,\n\n30\n00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.700\nwe're gonna talk about advanced filters,\nand\n\n31\n00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.500\nwe kinda alluded to this\nin the remove duplicates.\n\n32\n00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.230\nRemember, we talked about that?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n33\n00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.600\n&gt;&gt; And when I went to them I'm like, yeah,\n\n34\n00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.480\nthere's some really cool\n&gt;&gt; Things that advanced filters can do,\n\n35\n00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.740\nbut that's for something later.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n36\n00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.088\nI said, they have advanced features.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n37\n00:01:21.088 --> 00:01:22.482\n&gt;&gt; Because it's advanced,\n\n38\n00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:26.854\nwhich really just usually means other\nfeatures, not necessarily advanced, but\n\n39\n00:01:26.854 --> 00:01:30.884\njust not the ones you normally use.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's advanced, but\n\n40\n00:01:30.884 --> 00:01:33.865\nin this time frame,\nit's kinda like totally\n\n41\n00:01:33.865 --> 00:01:36.825\nnot advanced because we have all the.\n&gt;&gt; -Like\n\n42\n00:01:36.825 --> 00:01:37.425\nI said.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n43\n00:01:37.425 --> 00:01:38.565\n&gt;&gt; Just other stuff.\n\n44\n00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:41.365\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and back in the day\n\n45\n00:01:41.365 --> 00:01:45.225\nthis was like, okay this is the way you\ndid advanced filtering because you didn't\n\n46\n00:01:45.225 --> 00:01:49.220\nhave the awesome way of formatting tables.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n47\n00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.740\nthe things that we talked about\nin the formatting is tables,\n\n48\n00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.639\nand where you could do the dropdowns, and\nyou could do all of these greater-than,\n\n49\n00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:58.550\nless-thans, and all these filters\nthat you can do in a table.\n\n50\n00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.310\nWell we're gonna do it, but\nin a very manual, old school way.\n\n51\n00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.370\nBut I wanted to show you because it's\nkinda good just to know that this exists,\n\n52\n00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:09.360\nbecause yeah,\n\n53\n00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.728\nmaybe there is some reason why you\ncannot format your data as a table.\n\n54\n00:02:13.728 --> 00:02:15.640\nIt happens.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n55\n00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.310\n&gt;&gt; There's some reasons why.\n\n56\n00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.460\nMaybe you're working with somebody who\njust really doesn't like tables and\n\n57\n00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.592\nrefuses to work with them.\n&gt;&gt; That would be me.\n\n58\n00:02:24.592 --> 00:02:25.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n59\n00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.700\n&gt;&gt; Or is somebody that's, I mean-\n\n60\n00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.595\n&gt;&gt; You can't make me Vonne.\n\n61\n00:02:27.595 --> 00:02:28.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n62\n00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:29.360\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n63\n00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.540\nI mean it's just, there are reasons,\nokay, otherwise, it wouldn't exist.\n\n64\n00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.290\nOkay, yeah, maybe there's a greater\nways to do it now, anyways,\n\n65\n00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.820\nenough yibber yabbing.\n&gt;&gt; Yibber yabbing.\n\n66\n00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.540\nIs that a word?\n&gt;&gt; It's a Vaughn-ism.\n\n67\n00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.175\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I'll take it.\n\n68\n00:02:43.175 --> 00:02:44.150\n&gt;&gt; Vaughn-glish right?\n\n69\n00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.326\nIs that what you call it?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n70\n00:02:46.326 --> 00:02:46.835\n&gt;&gt; Vaughn-glish.\n\n71\n00:02:46.835 --> 00:02:47.590\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, Vaughn-glish.\n\n72\n00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.605\nMy own language [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Man we have to write these down.\n\n73\n00:02:50.605 --> 00:02:53.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's an ever evolving.\n\n74\n00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.840\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n75\n00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.410\n&gt;&gt; It's a living\n\n76\n00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.268\nlanguage.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n77\n00:02:55.268 --> 00:02:59.300\n[LAUGH] All right,\nwhy don't we go ahead and get started.\n\n78\n00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.510\nI have a file called Advanced Features.\n\n79\n00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.210\nFeatures, filters, yes, okay, and\n\n80\n00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.880\nwe've seen this information quite a few\ndifferent times, and we have some cells.\n\n81\n00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.460\nYou can seee Last Name, First Name.\n\n82\n00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.660\nWe have some city, states,\nand zips and everything.\n\n83\n00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.330\nOkay, so when you're gonna be\ndoing advanced filters, you're\n\n84\n00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.300\ngoing to be filtering based on a criteria,\nwhich is kind of what a filter is, and\n\n85\n00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.900\nwhat you're gonna have to do is you're\ngonna need to set up your information and\n\n86\n00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.120\nyour filter criteria.\n\n87\n00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.280\nSeparate than your data range.\n\n88\n00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.400\nThis right here,\n\n89\n00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.310\nthis contains information arranged in\ncells, this is going to be our data table.\n\n90\n00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.110\nGosh, using those words again.\n\n91\n00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.980\nThis is not an actual data\ntable as you can do in Excel-\n\n92\n00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.940\n&gt;&gt; But it's a table with data in\n\n93\n00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:46.530\nit.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n94\n00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.590\n&gt;&gt; So you just start saying,\n\n95\n00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.720\nit's not an Excel data table,\n\n96\n00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.600\nit's just a table of data.\n\n97\n00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.205\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n98\n00:03:53.205 --> 00:03:54.025\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n99\n00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:55.475\nA continous range of cells\n\n100\n00:03:55.475 --> 00:03:56.595\nthat is our data.\n\n101\n00:03:56.595 --> 00:03:57.145\nThere we go.\n\n102\n00:03:57.145 --> 00:03:57.805\nYay.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n103\n00:03:57.805 --> 00:03:59.225\n&gt;&gt; So that's what we're going to use.\n\n104\n00:03:59.225 --> 00:04:01.465\nWe got to put our filter criterias\n\n105\n00:04:01.465 --> 00:04:05.705\noutside somewhere else.\nNow you could put this off to the side,\n\n106\n00:04:05.705 --> 00:04:09.165\nyou could put this up the way that I'm\ngoing to do in this demonstration is,\n\n107\n00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:13.155\nI'm going to just put this up above and\nthen use that as\n\n108\n00:04:13.155 --> 00:04:17.375\nwhat I want to put in my filter criteria.\nSo we're going to just add a couple new\n\n109\n00:04:17.375 --> 00:04:21.285\nrows, then we'll want to sharpen up by\njust selecting the first five rows,\n\n110\n00:04:21.285 --> 00:04:25.955\nright clicking and then going to enter,\nbecause that inserts five more rows on top\n\n111\n00:04:25.955 --> 00:04:30.870\nof that, because inserts always go above.\nAnd so I've got a little bit of space.\n\n112\n00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.250\nI am going to copy out\n\n113\n00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.340\nthis hetero because you know by now\nwhy heteros are so very important.\n\n114\n00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.850\nOkay, I'm going to take this and\ncopy command c.\n\n115\n00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.520\nCome here to our first row command v and\npaste it.\n\n116\n00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.850\nDo I have to get every single\none of my header rows?\n\n117\n00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.220\nNo, you could of just\ntaken two of them and\n\n118\n00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.160\nput them off to the side, they don't\neven have to be in the same column, so\n\n119\n00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.750\nI don't want you to think that the way\nthat I am putting my filter criteria,\n\n120\n00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.870\nlike the placement is imperative that\nyou have to follow this, no, you\n\n121\n00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.670\ncan put it off to the side, it's fine, you\ndo need to keep it in the same worksheet.\n\n122\n00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.030\nYou can't put it off to somewhere else.\n\n123\n00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.200\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n124\n00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.010\nNow, I'll go ahead and hit Escape.\n\n125\n00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:22.600\nAnd so now, what I'm going to do up here,\nis I'm going to use these areas,\n\n126\n00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.210\nor these different columns,\nthat I want to filter by.\n\n127\n00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.690\nFor example,\nwhat if I wanted to filter by state?\n\n128\n00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.730\nI only want to see the records or\n\n129\n00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.410\nthe information that is\nin the state of Florida.\n\n130\n00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.390\nSo I have my criteria here.\n\n131\n00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.030\nThis is my state.\n\n132\n00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:48.570\nI would like to put in under the state\ncolumn, in the next row, FL.\n\n133\n00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:55.240\nYou do need to make sure that you type\nit in like the information is in your.\n\n134\n00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:01.380\nData range, because if I put in FLA,\nnone of these say FLA.\n\n135\n00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.440\nSo again, more manual, because this\nis weird, remember with the tables,\n\n136\n00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.970\nyou had the drop downs,\nyou could check them off.\n\n137\n00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.500\nIt's like well,\nthen I don't have to worry about that.\n\n138\n00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.580\nSo it's like, why are you\nmaking me do it this weird way?\n\n139\n00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.788\nI just need you to know that this exists.\n\n140\n00:06:13.788 --> 00:06:14.400\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But, [LAUGH] So\n\n141\n00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.780\nI have-\n&gt;&gt; This is a thing in the world,\n\n142\n00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.050\nget used to it, here it is.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n143\n00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.990\nAnd maybe this will give\nyou an appreciation for-\n\n144\n00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.310\n&gt;&gt; How far we've come.\n\n145\n00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:24.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n146\n00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.870\nI'm definitely gonna be using\ntables because this is like weird.\n\n147\n00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.930\nI'm really selling this, right?\n&gt;&gt; Especially if you're a programmer.\n\n148\n00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:31.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean-\n\n149\n00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.680\n&gt;&gt; If you're a programmer this\n\n150\n00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.500\nis gonna be like mother's milk to you.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n151\n00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.490\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna be like,\n\n152\n00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.140\nI totally get this.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n153\n00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.750\nand again, there's always different\nways and reasons why you might\n\n154\n00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.280\nneed to do this from time to time.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n155\n00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.150\n&gt;&gt; So, let's go ahead and\n\n156\n00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.970\nthen filter our information\nbased on this criteria,\n\n157\n00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:51.490\nusing our advanced filters\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to put my cursor somewhere\n\n158\n00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.550\nin my data range.\n\n159\n00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:57.200\nI will go over to data and\nI will go into the advanced.\n\n160\n00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:02.860\nNow, do be careful that our list\nrange make sure it gets everything.\n\n161\n00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.620\nDo you see my gray line?\n\n162\n00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.280\nOr those green dotted ants?\n\n163\n00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:12.230\nThey're not getting the whole table or\nwhole area that I want to filter out,\n\n164\n00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.160\nso\n&gt;&gt; If it doesn't, make sure you come in,\n\n165\n00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.420\nand for this one,\nI'm just going to extend it.\n\n166\n00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.550\nI'm going to hold the Shift key and\nthen that last cell.\n\n167\n00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:26.970\nAnd then yep, it's getting my\nwhole range from A6 down to L31.\n\n168\n00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:28.580\nYep, that's where I need to be.\n\n169\n00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.360\nSo just be careful about that.\n\n170\n00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.510\nMost of the time it's pretty good at\njudging, yep, this is where it is.\n\n171\n00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.620\nWhy it cut that one off?\n\n172\n00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.530\nWho knows?\n&gt;&gt; Who knows exactly?\n\n173\n00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:39.970\nGoes to the machine.\n\n174\n00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:44.420\nSo we are going to then put out\ncursor into the criteria range.\n\n175\n00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:45.524\nThat’s another thing,\n\n176\n00:07:45.524 --> 00:07:48.530\nmake sure you change your cursor to\nthe fields you need to populate.\n\n177\n00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:53.555\nPersonal criteria range,\nyou’re going to select the header row or\n\n178\n00:07:53.555 --> 00:07:59.284\nthe column header and the criteria that\nI listed which was Florida All right,\n\n179\n00:07:59.284 --> 00:08:02.897\nand I am going to, for\nthese examples, do this,\n\n180\n00:08:02.897 --> 00:08:07.685\nfilter the list in place,\nbecause that’s what I'd like to do.\n\n181\n00:08:07.685 --> 00:08:10.308\nWe used this whole unique records when\nwe were doing the remove duplicates.\n\n182\n00:08:10.308 --> 00:08:14.390\nIn this sense, no, based on my criteria,\nI’m good, I click OK.\n\n183\n00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:18.339\nAnd then you can see that,\nyes, I have filtered out, and\n\n184\n00:08:18.339 --> 00:08:23.712\nI am only showing the information,\nwith the criteria of State equals Florida.\n\n185\n00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:26.019\nI know I have filtered information,\n\n186\n00:08:26.019 --> 00:08:28.970\nbecause we have those\nblue rows over there.\n\n187\n00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:34.045\nSo I can see that there are some that\nare not being displayed, [LAUGH].\n\n188\n00:08:34.045 --> 00:08:34.591\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n189\n00:08:34.591 --> 00:08:35.318\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n190\n00:08:35.318 --> 00:08:39.259\nAnd I know it's filtered because\nof the blue, neat, okay,\n\n191\n00:08:39.259 --> 00:08:43.880\nand that's a single criteria, but\nwhat about if I wanted to see this?\n\n192\n00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.728\nOkay, now this is where we get into the\nand's and the or's, and you know a little\n\n193\n00:08:47.728 --> 00:08:50.803\nbit about this logical operations and-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n194\n00:08:50.803 --> 00:08:51.737\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so I would like to see,\n\n195\n00:08:51.737 --> 00:08:57.248\nif I'm going to say, and,\nI want to see anything within\n\n196\n00:08:57.248 --> 00:09:02.688\nthe state of Florida, and\nwith a category of toys.\n\n197\n00:09:02.688 --> 00:09:07.761\nSo that means, just really means,\njust show me Florida and the toys,\n\n198\n00:09:07.761 --> 00:09:11.196\nwhich is what I just said, [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n199\n00:09:11.196 --> 00:09:14.750\nthis is what is called Boolean operator,\nright?\n\n200\n00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.542\nThis, or yeah, Boolean, right?\n\n201\n00:09:16.542 --> 00:09:19.307\nThat's how I think it's said,\nis you're saying, I want,\n\n202\n00:09:19.307 --> 00:09:21.922\nit's basically an equation,\njust think of it that way.\n\n203\n00:09:21.922 --> 00:09:24.739\nWe've got two sides and\nin the middle is that and, or,\n\n204\n00:09:24.739 --> 00:09:28.130\nthe ampersand,\nis what we normally see as an and, right?\n\n205\n00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:33.070\nOn this side and on this side,\nit must be both to return true.\n\n206\n00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:36.271\nSo if one of those things does not exist,\nthen it's not going to return true, and\n\n207\n00:09:36.271 --> 00:09:37.593\nyou are going to have a problem.\n\n208\n00:09:37.593 --> 00:09:41.744\nSo if you use that logical and,\nboth must be true before\n\n209\n00:09:41.744 --> 00:09:46.659\nthe statement works.\n&gt;&gt; Deemed true, yeah, yeah, this\n\n210\n00:09:46.659 --> 00:09:51.333\nmust be true for it be true [LAUGH], yes,\nexactly, so if I typed in Toys up here.\n\n211\n00:09:51.333 --> 00:09:56.442\nSo now I'm taking two different\ncategories, or two different columns,\n\n212\n00:09:56.442 --> 00:10:01.140\nand parameters that I want to do,\nso we do the same thing.\n\n213\n00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:05.748\nNow notice if I click back down into my\nrange, and then I, let's go ahead and\n\n214\n00:10:05.748 --> 00:10:07.118\nclear it just for fun.\n\n215\n00:10:07.118 --> 00:10:11.014\nJust to get used to like, hey, let's get\nrid of all that filtering first, and\n\n216\n00:10:11.014 --> 00:10:13.060\nnow let's go ahead and click Advanced.\n\n217\n00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:15.453\nThis time, it did get my range,\nwhich is good.\n\n218\n00:10:15.453 --> 00:10:20.501\nBut the list criteria here where,\nand also notice I did\n\n219\n00:10:20.501 --> 00:10:25.815\nnot grab that whole,\nall the way from first to down here.\n\n220\n00:10:25.815 --> 00:10:29.819\nNo, you don't have to get all of it,\nI just grabbed the parts that I needed,\n\n221\n00:10:29.819 --> 00:10:31.894\nbut it does have to be stacked this way.\n\n222\n00:10:31.894 --> 00:10:35.323\nRemember I said about that setup,\nyou have to make sure it has to be,\n\n223\n00:10:35.323 --> 00:10:38.670\nhere's the header,\nhere's the criteria that I want.\n\n224\n00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:40.907\nSo you can't just put it\nin two different places,\n\n225\n00:10:40.907 --> 00:10:43.051\nthey've got to be stacked\non top of each other.\n\n226\n00:10:43.051 --> 00:10:46.400\nAnd in this list, or,\nsorry, criteria range,\n\n227\n00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.620\nI'm just going to backspace,\nI want both of these.\n\n228\n00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:54.366\nNow, yes, I grab Zip and Sales Rep, but\nthere's nothing in there, it's blank, so\n\n229\n00:10:54.366 --> 00:10:55.415\nthere is no criteria.\n\n230\n00:10:55.415 --> 00:10:59.505\nIt's like, this is the thing, or\nthe column that we're using, and\n\n231\n00:10:59.505 --> 00:11:01.460\nthis is the criteria value.\n\n232\n00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:07.235\nSo we're doing, it must be State\nof Florida, and, Category of Toys.\n\n233\n00:11:07.235 --> 00:11:12.228\nSo we click, filter in place, yeah,\nwe click OK, and then there you go, so\n\n234\n00:11:12.228 --> 00:11:15.500\nnow I can see the Toys are in Florida,\ngreat.\n\n235\n00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:19.196\nSo that's how we get, again,\nall those are really cute\n\n236\n00:11:19.196 --> 00:11:23.141\nlittle drop downs in the tables,\nbut we have this going on.\n\n237\n00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:27.240\nOr, this is where I'm going to\ntake the category out, okay?\n\n238\n00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:32.299\nWe're going to clear that one out,\nand we're going to clear the filter\n\n239\n00:11:32.299 --> 00:11:36.950\naltogether, I want to see the states\nof Florida, or, New York.\n\n240\n00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:41.287\nWhich is weird, because in my brain, it's\nlike, I want to see Florida and New York.\n\n241\n00:11:41.287 --> 00:11:45.143\nLike those are the ones that I\nwant to see as my results, but\n\n242\n00:11:45.143 --> 00:11:48.879\nyou don't say it that way.\n&gt;&gt; It depends on the situation, right,\n\n243\n00:11:48.879 --> 00:11:52.519\nso sometimes, because remember,\nif this is an equation, and you say,\n\n244\n00:11:52.519 --> 00:11:54.264\nand, I need Florida and New York.\n\n245\n00:11:54.264 --> 00:11:58.136\nAnd one of those isn't there,\ndoesn't equal, doesn't work out,\n\n246\n00:11:58.136 --> 00:12:01.190\nthen you don't get any results at all.\n\n247\n00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:05.848\nBut if sometimes, so you'll use an or\nto say, I want Florida or New York,\n\n248\n00:12:05.848 --> 00:12:08.193\nso it will show Florida and New York.\n\n249\n00:12:08.193 --> 00:12:11.347\nBut if there are no Florida, or there\nare no New York, you still get results for\n\n250\n00:12:11.347 --> 00:12:14.019\nthe other that's not there.\n&gt;&gt; And there is not a Florida, New York.\n\n251\n00:12:14.019 --> 00:12:15.114\n&gt;&gt; Right, it doesn't exist.\n\n252\n00:12:15.114 --> 00:12:18.268\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there's Florida or New York, so\n\n253\n00:12:18.268 --> 00:12:21.585\nif either one of them are true-\n&gt;&gt; Then you get true.\n\n254\n00:12:21.585 --> 00:12:22.949\n&gt;&gt; Rather than both of them have to be\n\n255\n00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:23.797\ntrue.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n256\n00:12:23.797 --> 00:12:24.745\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and it's weird.\n\n257\n00:12:24.745 --> 00:12:25.458\n&gt;&gt; It is weird.\n\n258\n00:12:25.458 --> 00:12:27.793\n&gt;&gt; Right, you have to think logically, and\n\n259\n00:12:27.793 --> 00:12:30.891\nthat's really hard for me, [LAUGH], so-\n&gt;&gt; Like mother's milk, [LAUGH].\n\n260\n00:12:30.891 --> 00:12:34.232\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] If I'm doing the or,\n\n261\n00:12:34.232 --> 00:12:40.344\nyou put it on another row,\nso it's Florida or NY.\n\n262\n00:12:40.344 --> 00:12:44.590\nAnd you can see that, yep, I've got some\nNew Yorks and I've got some Floridas.\n\n263\n00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:50.392\nSo that's my or statement on the next\nrow down, so get the idea here?\n\n264\n00:12:50.392 --> 00:12:54.093\nYou have to kind of use that\nstructure of the rows, and\n\n265\n00:12:54.093 --> 00:12:58.640\nthen on the same line,\nwhich we'll come back to in just a second.\n\n266\n00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:02.588\nSo let's do this again, Advanced,\nokay, yep, there's my list,\n\n267\n00:13:02.588 --> 00:13:04.645\nlet's go with the criteria range.\n\n268\n00:13:04.645 --> 00:13:09.053\nIt's not getting that extra row,\nso I want to grab here, and\n\n269\n00:13:09.053 --> 00:13:15.076\nthen I click OK, and there it is,\nyep, there's Florida and New York.\n\n270\n00:13:15.076 --> 00:13:19.421\nAnd throw in a kicker,\nI want to see Florida or New York, but\n\n271\n00:13:19.421 --> 00:13:21.850\nonly the categories of Toys.\n\n272\n00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:25.459\nSo let's just look at this, okay,\njust to make sure, and you know what,\n\n273\n00:13:25.459 --> 00:13:27.277\nI have to do something really quick.\n\n274\n00:13:27.277 --> 00:13:29.104\nI have to change one of these, [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n275\n00:13:29.104 --> 00:13:31.095\n&gt;&gt; So I realized that I wouldn't have any\n\n276\n00:13:31.095 --> 00:13:33.493\ntoys in New York, so\njust pretend, so that, look,\n\n277\n00:13:33.493 --> 00:13:35.410\nthere's only three New Yorks, right?\n\n278\n00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:37.556\nAnd we have toys, food, clothing.\n\n279\n00:13:37.556 --> 00:13:42.131\nHere's Florida, and there's some toys,\nthere are all four categories, so\n\n280\n00:13:42.131 --> 00:13:43.331\nwatch this, okay?\n\n281\n00:13:43.331 --> 00:13:47.097\nWe're going to click our cursor back\nin here, we're going back to Advanced,\n\n282\n00:13:47.097 --> 00:13:48.250\nhere's my list range.\n\n283\n00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:54.223\nMy criteria range, this time,\nis going to be this, right?\n\n284\n00:13:54.223 --> 00:13:58.860\nBecause we've got to get the or for\nthe state, and then the and, the category.\n\n285\n00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:02.988\nSo the result you would think would\nbe Florida, New York, and only Toys,\n\n286\n00:14:02.988 --> 00:14:06.060\nI wouldn't see any Clothing or\nAccessories, right?\n\n287\n00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.384\nBecause that's what I've got.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n288\n00:14:08.384 --> 00:14:12.680\n&gt;&gt; But watch, yeah, yeah, wait, what?\n\n289\n00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.140\nWhy is New York trying Food and Clothing?\n\n290\n00:14:17.759 --> 00:14:21.690\nRemember the whole idea about the rows,\nthe setup?\n\n291\n00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:26.464\nYou're only saying, well,\nthe Florida and Toys, but New York.\n\n292\n00:14:26.464 --> 00:14:27.058\n&gt;&gt; Anything.\n\n293\n00:14:27.058 --> 00:14:29.644\n&gt;&gt; Anything, yeah, so that's the kind of\n\n294\n00:14:29.644 --> 00:14:35.486\nkicker right there, that if you wanted,\nI wasn't expecting this to come out.\n\n295\n00:14:35.486 --> 00:14:41.717\nYou're going to have to repeat\nthe word Toys on that other row,\n\n296\n00:14:41.717 --> 00:14:47.844\nbecause it's like, Florida and\nToys, or New York and Toys.\n\n297\n00:14:47.844 --> 00:14:50.210\nOkay, I see how that goes.\n\n298\n00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:53.972\nSo once we come into here,\nuse our criteria list, and then, okay,\n\n299\n00:14:53.972 --> 00:14:57.351\nnow I've still got it, so\nI don't have to change anything.\n\n300\n00:14:57.351 --> 00:14:58.364\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n301\n00:14:58.364 --> 00:14:59.471\n&gt;&gt; And then it will go ahead and\n\n302\n00:14:59.471 --> 00:15:00.393\ngive you the results.\n\n303\n00:15:00.393 --> 00:15:05.478\nSo, if you're not used to these\nkind of logical operations,\n\n304\n00:15:05.478 --> 00:15:09.250\nor operators, and\nall of the logic behind it.\n\n305\n00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:13.383\nAnd how it is more in computer speak\nrather than us speak, [LAUGH],\n\n306\n00:15:13.383 --> 00:15:17.159\nit can be a little confusing in there.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, until you get those things\n\n307\n00:15:17.159 --> 00:15:20.020\nsquared away in your mind on\nhow it's supposed to work out.\n\n308\n00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:22.803\nYou're going to do a lot of trial and\nerror, mostly error, [LAUGH].\n\n309\n00:15:22.803 --> 00:15:24.502\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, yeah, so,\n\n310\n00:15:24.502 --> 00:15:26.990\nI'm going to go ahead and clear this.\n\n311\n00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:31.615\nJust to give you a couple of other\nexamples, you can use this with text.\n\n312\n00:15:31.615 --> 00:15:35.862\nFor example, if I cleared out everything\nin the City, sorry, the State, and\n\n313\n00:15:35.862 --> 00:15:36.663\nthe category.\n\n314\n00:15:36.663 --> 00:15:41.228\nIf I come over here to Last, and\nthen I just type in the letter P, and\n\n315\n00:15:41.228 --> 00:15:43.366\nthen let's see what that happens.\n\n316\n00:15:43.366 --> 00:15:48.044\nJust to kind of look at, okay,\nthere's Pants and Paws and\n\n317\n00:15:48.044 --> 00:15:52.539\nPrincess, so just like to do\nit on a nice small data set.\n\n318\n00:15:52.539 --> 00:15:58.602\nSame thing, and our criteria\nrange is going to just be here.\n\n319\n00:15:58.602 --> 00:16:02.426\nYou click OK, and then, yeah, that's what\nit did, because I only typed the letter P.\n\n320\n00:16:02.426 --> 00:16:06.939\nBut you can use different\nthings like wildcards.\n\n321\n00:16:06.939 --> 00:16:11.810\nFor example, if I cleared this out,\nwell, actually, I don't have to.\n\n322\n00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:13.380\nI can clear it.\n\n323\n00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:16.910\nThat's fine.\nIf I typed in, what is that?\n\n324\n00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:20.960\nThat's an asterisk, and\nthen What does that mean?\n\n325\n00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.860\nIt means anything before.\n\n326\n00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:27.760\nAnd let's see what it\ndoes once we go ahead and\n\n327\n00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:31.490\nuse the advance,\nsame criteria, click Okay.\n\n328\n00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:35.345\nAnd then you say there's Wonderpause,\nFlower, Tiger,\n\n329\n00:16:35.345 --> 00:16:40.340\nbecause they're defining all instances\nof hey, anything with In it and\n\n330\n00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:43.030\nthen there you go.\n&gt;&gt; This is a devil we like to call regular\n\n331\n00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:44.380\nexpression.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n332\n00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:45.170\n&gt;&gt; And it is the\n\n333\n00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:45.810\ndevil.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n334\n00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:46.468\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n335\n00:16:46.468 --> 00:16:48.781\n&gt;&gt; Does that get really can't believe in\n\n336\n00:16:48.781 --> 00:16:52.541\nlike there is a lot more characters\nthat you can use the stars,\n\n337\n00:16:52.541 --> 00:16:54.070\nthe most commonly used.\n\n338\n00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:56.365\nBecause it's like maybe anything,\nI'm looking for\n\n339\n00:16:56.365 --> 00:17:00.710\nbecause I don't know what it is I'm\nlooking for, when it gets really wicked\n\n340\n00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:02.390\ncomplex real quick.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n341\n00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:06.150\nI remember we did the relational database\ndesign show, if you haven't watched that\n\n342\n00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:07.260\nit's actually really a fun show.\n&gt;&gt;

The angle brackets for less then?\n\n387\n00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.825\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and that's where.\n\n388\n00:19:14.825 --> 00:19:19.800\nBecause I always get those confused.\n&gt;&gt; The alligator johns,\n\n389\n00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.520\nis that what they were called.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, remember in math in school,\n\n390\n00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:26.010\nif you had two numbers, it was like\nthe gator mouth will eat the bigger one.\n\n391\n00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:28.150\nWell, if it was on the left,\nthen you'd gobble it this way.\n\n392\n00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:30.490\nIf it was on the right,\nthen you'd gobble it this way.\n\n393\n00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:35.310\nBut they're two different ways,\nso I'd always get confused,\n\n394\n00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:39.999\nbecause that's all I could think of.\n&gt;&gt;

Yes.\n\n398\n00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:45.930\n&gt;&gt; Over here would mean,\n\n399\n00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:47.570\nthat's greater than this-\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n400\n00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:48.540\n&gt;&gt; If it's over here, that means that is\n\n401\n00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:50.950\ngreater than that.\n&gt;&gt; But if we're writing it in,\n\n402\n00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:54.390\nwhat is the actual symbol, here?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n403\n00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:56.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's where, wait, because\n\n404\n00:19:56.770 --> 00:20:00.090\nthat's less than, then greater than, okay.\n&gt;&gt; Something's greater than ten.\n\n405\n00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:03.130\nOkay this is the way I remember it,\nI know this is really weird, but\n\n406\n00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:06.460\nyou have different little tricks\nto remind yourself of things.\n\n407\n00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:07.220\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n\n553\n00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:09.679\n&gt;&gt; And a box of matches.\n\n554\n00:26:09.679 --> 00:26:11.024\n&gt;&gt; Talking about going to Redmond.\n\n555\n00:26:11.024 --> 00:26:13.221\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was just like, I can't,\n\n556\n00:26:13.221 --> 00:26:17.552\nseriously, 15 years I've been\ndoing it like this, at least!\n\n557\n00:26:17.552 --> 00:26:22.840\nAnd no, it just doesn't exist,\nnot be discussed around other worksheets.\n\n558\n00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.406\nOkay, thank you, Microsoft.\n&gt;&gt; You have to give Excel perspective.\n\n559\n00:26:25.406 --> 00:26:26.437\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n560\n00:26:26.437 --> 00:26:28.789\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't know, it's not clairvoyant,\n\n561\n00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:30.351\nVonne.\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah, [LAUGH].\n\n567\n00:26:46.936 --> 00:26:47.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n568\n00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:52.640\nthen everything that we just did, so\nyou can see I've got some information.\n\n569\n00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:54.369\nI could just go to, this is a table,\n\n570\n00:26:54.369 --> 00:26:57.490\nthis should be a review if you've\nbeen watching the episodes.\n\n571\n00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:00.390\nLet's go here,\npast table headers, click OK.\n\n572\n00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:05.460\nHey, you know what,\nI want to see cats with blue and\n\n573\n00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:09.590\nyellow eyes, so you click this drop down,\nand then you just uncheck Green.\n\n574\n00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:12.160\nAnd then there you go,\n[LAUGH], that seems so\n\n575\n00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:15.646\nmuch more simpler, more simpler,\nwhoo, let's check my grammar.\n\n576\n00:27:15.646 --> 00:27:20.187\n[LAUGH] That's so much easier\nthan the way I just did it, and\n\n577\n00:27:20.187 --> 00:27:23.629\nthen I only want to see\nthem in Gainesville.\n\n578\n00:27:23.629 --> 00:27:25.575\n[SOUND] Okay.\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n\n590\n00:28:04.852 --> 00:28:07.407\n&gt;&gt; And you could do it that way.\n\n591\n00:28:07.407 --> 00:28:08.974\n&gt;&gt; I feel like I need to get you a poster\n\n592\n00:28:08.974 --> 00:28:11.534\nthat says I want to believe.\n&gt;&gt;

ahead and there you go?\n\n40\n00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.090\nYou feeling better now?\n\n41\n00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.491\n&gt;&gt; I am soothed.\n\n42\n00:01:39.491 --> 00:01:40.440\nThank you so much.\n\n43\n00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.519\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n44\n00:01:41.519 --> 00:01:45.913\nAll right, I'm gonna add another\nblank worksheet for now and\n\n45\n00:01:45.913 --> 00:01:47.950\nuse our moving it to the end.\n\n46\n00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.860\nCome on, gotta look for the triangles.\n\n47\n00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.163\nI always tell people that and I'm not\nlistening to my own rules, all right?\n\n48\n00:01:57.163 --> 00:02:01.765\nWe have our format shape\ntask pane up right now.\n\n49\n00:02:01.765 --> 00:02:03.187\nIt's like magical cuz it's shaped,\n\n50\n00:02:03.187 --> 00:02:06.015\nno, it's just cuz there's nothing\nin there right now, okay?\n\n51\n00:02:06.015 --> 00:02:09.386\nBut same with our images, you could\nalways go to that particular pane and\n\n52\n00:02:09.386 --> 00:02:10.497\ndo some other editing.\n\n53\n00:02:10.497 --> 00:02:13.335\nWe'll come back to that\na little bit later.\n\n54\n00:02:13.335 --> 00:02:14.335\nHow do I insert a shape?\n\n55\n00:02:14.335 --> 00:02:16.880\nWell, we go to the Insert tab for\none thing.\n\n56\n00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.160\nAnd then, we go to Shape, and there's\nall sorts of cool little shapes in here.\n\n57\n00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.340\nLet's just start with a pretty basic one.\n\n58\n00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.840\nWe'll go with a circle.\n\n59\n00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.150\nSo it's just like a box of crayons.\n\n60\n00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.920\nYou're picking out the crayon\nthat you would like to draw with.\n\n61\n00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.860\nSo when I click it, people are like,\nwell, there's no circle.\n\n62\n00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.650\nI know, it's kinda like when you\npick a crayon out of the box,\n\n63\n00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.270\nthe crayon's in your hand.\n\n64\n00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.530\nAnd then once you have the crayon in your\nhand, you have to draw onto the paper.\n\n65\n00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.728\nSo that's what you have to do.\n\n66\n00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:46.810\nIt's loaded up and notice that my cursor\nlooks like a crosshair right now.\n\n67\n00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.350\nSo that means I can do one of two things.\n\n68\n00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.340\nI can click once or\nI can click, hold, and drag.\n\n69\n00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.880\nIf I single click, it will go ahead and\ninsert that shape.\n\n70\n00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.853\nIt took a little while, and\nit puts it into how that shape is\n\n71\n00:03:04.853 --> 00:03:09.231\nnormally shaped, [LAUGH] for\nlack of a better term.\n\n72\n00:03:09.231 --> 00:03:11.480\nIt's a perfect circle right now.\n\n73\n00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.882\nNotice I'm back into like my\nregular Excel cell selection now,\n\n74\n00:03:15.882 --> 00:03:18.829\nI do not have the crayon\nin my hand anymore.\n\n75\n00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:19.779\nI'm not drawing.\n\n76\n00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:23.723\nSo if I wanted go back and\ndraw another circle, go back to Insert,\n\n77\n00:03:23.723 --> 00:03:26.060\ngo back to Shapes, pick a circle.\n\n78\n00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.160\nSo let's do the other way of inserting\na shape, you do the click, hold, and drag.\n\n79\n00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.700\nWhen I click, hold, and drag, notice\nI can make this more of like an oval,\n\n80\n00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.140\nwhether long or tall.\n\n81\n00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.000\nI'm just holding my mouse down and\n\n82\n00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.930\nwhen I let go,\nit will make that particular shape.\n\n83\n00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.470\nSo you have the option\nof kinda free-forming\n\n84\n00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.340\nin how you want that\nparticular shape to be.\n\n85\n00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.060\nAnd it's free form.\n\n86\n00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.780\nBut if I went back over here to Insert and\nwe go back into Shapes and\n\n87\n00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.410\nlet's say we go with,\nlet's take a heart right here.\n\n88\n00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:59.160\nIf I click, hold and\n\n89\n00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.840\ndrag and I'm not holding any keys, notice\nI can make it kinda long, kind of wide.\n\n90\n00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.160\nBut if I wanted to keep it in\nthe proportions that the shape was\n\n91\n00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.780\nmeant to be in, I have not let go of my\nmouse right now, that's why I can do this.\n\n92\n00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.150\nIf I hold my Shift key,\nthe Shift key will maintain proportions.\n\n93\n00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.190\nWe talked about that in\none of the other episodes.\n\n94\n00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.890\nAnd it's just the same thing\nthat we do with all graphics.\n\n95\n00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.520\nShift to maintain proportion.\n\n96\n00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.331\nSo if I let go of the mouse first,\nand then let go of the Shift key,\n\n97\n00:04:27.331 --> 00:04:30.098\nnow I can make that heart\nwhatever size I want.\n\n98\n00:04:30.098 --> 00:04:34.094\nBut just like with our pictures,\nif you wanted to resize this circle,\n\n99\n00:04:34.094 --> 00:04:36.814\nnotice I get my four point arrows,\nI select it.\n\n100\n00:04:36.814 --> 00:04:39.088\nGet the corner, make this bigger.\n\n101\n00:04:39.088 --> 00:04:42.037\nIf I wanted to hold this Shift\nkey here while I size it,\n\n102\n00:04:42.037 --> 00:04:43.953\nthat's something to know about.\n\n103\n00:04:43.953 --> 00:04:48.444\nSo the Shift is going to be important when\nwe're working with shapes as opposed to\n\n104\n00:04:48.444 --> 00:04:48.981\nimages.\n\n105\n00:04:48.981 --> 00:04:50.990\nRemember with images,\nwe could've gotten the corner and\n\n106\n00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.650\nit would've maintained\nproportions automatically.\n\n107\n00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.600\nDoesn't work like that with shapes.\n\n108\n00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.885\nGotta hold that Shift key down\nto go ahead and make that,\n\n109\n00:04:59.885 --> 00:05:02.444\nI wanted to make it bigger there.\n\n110\n00:05:02.444 --> 00:05:04.399\nSo that's what you need to know about.\n\n111\n00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:05.630\nYou still have the rotate.\n\n112\n00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.350\nSo if I want to rotate this heart\na little bit more, that's wonderful.\n\n113\n00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.290\nCuz maybe I wanna put this here, and\nthen I might as well go ahead and\n\n114\n00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.862\ndo this now just because I want to.\n\n115\n00:05:17.862 --> 00:05:20.180\nI want to copy this.\n\n116\n00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.530\nNow, just with anything,\nyou could copy and paste.\n\n117\n00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.310\nTotally fine.\n\n118\n00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.530\nI could have this selected.\n\n119\n00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:31.510\nI could Cmd+C, Cmd+B, and then I have\nanother one or I'm gonna delete this.\n\n120\n00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.227\nEither way,\nif I want to duplicate by dragging,\n\n121\n00:05:35.227 --> 00:05:37.867\nyou can use your Alt key or Option.\n\n122\n00:05:37.867 --> 00:05:42.033\nAlt+Option and\nthen drag will make a duplicate.\n\n123\n00:05:42.033 --> 00:05:46.037\nAs opposed to in PC land,\nI believe it's Ctrl.\n\n124\n00:05:46.037 --> 00:05:49.576\nBut Alt with all of my\ngraphic editing programs,\n\n125\n00:05:49.576 --> 00:05:53.474\nit's always Alt to duplicate so\nthat's [INAUDIBLE].\n\n126\n00:05:53.474 --> 00:05:56.255\nSo maybe I wanna go ahead and\nthen rotate this over here.\n\n127\n00:05:56.255 --> 00:06:02.450\nCuz I don't know, I'm making this weird\nheart, antelope looking thing right now.\n\n128\n00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.970\nNot really sure what I'm doing, but hey,\nI'm just making shapes and I'm having fun.\n\n129\n00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.930\nSo those are the different\nthings that you can go ahead and\n\n130\n00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.750\nrotate, duplicate,\nnow let's go ahead and format.\n\n131\n00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.115\nI wanna make this a different color.\n\n132\n00:06:15.115 --> 00:06:19.327\nHave it selected, now notice at\nthe top just like your images,\n\n133\n00:06:19.327 --> 00:06:22.034\nyou have a shape format contextual tab.\n\n134\n00:06:22.034 --> 00:06:26.555\nWith shapes you have insides and\nyou have outsides, fills, or\n\n135\n00:06:26.555 --> 00:06:30.580\nI wanna say strokes, but\nhere they call them outlines.\n\n136\n00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.300\nIf I wanted to change the inside\ncolor of this, I could.\n\n137\n00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.158\nMaybe I wanna make it green.\n\n138\n00:06:37.158 --> 00:06:42.200\nMaybe I wanna make it some other\nfill color like this light purple.\n\n139\n00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:44.620\nGo like that.\n\n140\n00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.600\nThe other thing you can do with your\nfills is that you can use gradients.\n\n141\n00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.476\nYou could also use textures.\n\n142\n00:06:51.476 --> 00:06:53.410\nYou gotta have some dead fish textures.\n\n143\n00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:54.950\nI just love this one.\n\n144\n00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:55.706\nYeah, no.\n\n145\n00:06:55.706 --> 00:06:58.210\nWe're gonna go ahead and\ndo the [INAUDIBLE].\n\n146\n00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:59.405\nYou can also do a picture.\n\n147\n00:06:59.405 --> 00:07:03.604\nBut the thing is I will tell you is\nremember the cropping that we did,\n\n148\n00:07:03.604 --> 00:07:07.593\nthat's way easier that filling\nthe shape in with that picture.\n\n149\n00:07:07.593 --> 00:07:10.724\nAnd it also distorts it and\neverything like that, but\n\n150\n00:07:10.724 --> 00:07:12.331\nyou do have it as an option.\n\n151\n00:07:12.331 --> 00:07:15.663\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\nchoose this pink color right here.\n\n152\n00:07:15.663 --> 00:07:17.021\nAnd with the gradients,\n\n153\n00:07:17.021 --> 00:07:20.974\nnotice how it's only doing this\nparticular color that I have right now.\n\n154\n00:07:20.974 --> 00:07:25.846\nAnd then so like black, or pink to white,\nyou want more gradients and\n\n155\n00:07:25.846 --> 00:07:29.044\npink and blue and\npurple and green, you can.\n\n156\n00:07:29.044 --> 00:07:31.413\nIt's just in the format\npictures task pane.\n\n157\n00:07:31.413 --> 00:07:35.461\nI wanna save that just for a little\nbit later cuz you can also do that on\n\n158\n00:07:35.461 --> 00:07:39.315\noutlines, which are not available\ndirectly in this dropdown.\n\n159\n00:07:39.315 --> 00:07:44.030\nBut it is in the format shape task pane.\n\n160\n00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.860\nSo we've got our fill.\n\n161\n00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.170\nWe have our outline.\n\n162\n00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:50.690\nAnd maybe I will make this\na light pink outline.\n\n163\n00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:52.519\nI can make this thicker.\n\n164\n00:07:52.519 --> 00:07:54.602\nThese are things that\nwe did in our images.\n\n165\n00:07:54.602 --> 00:07:57.230\nCan't really see that, so\nwhy don't I go with blue?\n\n166\n00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:58.920\nThat makes it a little bit better.\n\n167\n00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.706\nAnd just like images,\nyou have all the same effects.\n\n168\n00:08:02.706 --> 00:08:07.951\nYou cam do glows, you can do beveled,\nyou can do 3D rotations.\n\n169\n00:08:07.951 --> 00:08:09.510\nYou just basically, go through and pick.\n\n170\n00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:16.063\nThat really didn't do much for me,\nso lets go with a green glow, cute.\n\n171\n00:08:16.063 --> 00:08:16.920\nOopps, sorry,\nthat's a little bit too much.\n\n172\n00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.321\nYou can pick all those.\n\n173\n00:08:18.321 --> 00:08:22.691\nYou have some presets that are up at the\ntop that have any combination of shadows,\n\n174\n00:08:22.691 --> 00:08:25.660\nreflections, glows, edges,\nand so on and so forth.\n\n175\n00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:33.306\nThe styles are, they're not as,\nI don't know how to say, extensive?\n\n176\n00:08:33.306 --> 00:08:34.930\nIf you wanna say, than the images.\n\n177\n00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:40.122\nNotice it's just going to do things like,\ndoes it give like a little drop shadow?\n\n178\n00:08:40.122 --> 00:08:41.885\nDoes it give you transparency?\n\n179\n00:08:41.885 --> 00:08:47.790\nDoes, I don't know, I don't usually\nuse the styles too much on the shapes.\n\n180\n00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:52.672\nI'll pick them myself through\nthe effects and the fills and\n\n181\n00:08:52.672 --> 00:08:56.180\nthe outlines, and go from there.\n\n182\n00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:00.030\nBut, notice there's like, why is this\nonly ABC, why does it have text?\n\n183\n00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:02.750\nWe're talking about shapes, right?\n\n184\n00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:06.936\nWell that's because you can\nadd text into your shapes.\n\n185\n00:09:06.936 --> 00:09:08.200\nThat could be kind of fun.\n\n186\n00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:12.717\nAnd that's why it's showing you, these\ndifferent options of like, what color,\n\n187\n00:09:12.717 --> 00:09:14.081\nI want to go back to pink.\n\n188\n00:09:14.081 --> 00:09:18.220\nOf what color your text would be\nwithin the style that you're picking.\n\n189\n00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.986\nSo, just in case,\nyou're wondering about that, that text and\n\n190\n00:09:21.986 --> 00:09:24.861\nshapes don't match,\nactually they do, okay?\n\n191\n00:09:24.861 --> 00:09:29.820\nBut we'll come back to that\nin just a minute, okay?\n\n192\n00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:33.683\nSo, I've got these different\nlittle guys here, I don't know,\n\n193\n00:09:33.683 --> 00:09:35.310\nagain, what I'm making.\n\n194\n00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:38.435\nBut, I wanna go back over\nto some other things.\n\n195\n00:09:38.435 --> 00:09:41.987\nCuz, these right now,\nthis heart and this circle,\n\n196\n00:09:41.987 --> 00:09:46.369\nthese are what we would call in\na vector program, closed paths.\n\n197\n00:09:46.369 --> 00:09:49.260\nThey have an inside and\nthey have an outside.\n\n198\n00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:55.072\nBut you also have shapes that are just\nlines and notice it says lines.\n\n199\n00:09:55.072 --> 00:09:59.770\nWhen I have a line shape, if I just click,\nhold, and drag this, okay?\n\n200\n00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:03.909\nI don't have any fills, I could click it\nall day long and it's not gonna work,\n\n201\n00:10:03.909 --> 00:10:05.565\ncuz there's nothing inside.\n\n202\n00:10:05.565 --> 00:10:09.420\nThe only way that it's going\nto apply is with the outline.\n\n203\n00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:13.769\nSo if I choose, say, purple and\nthen made this a lot thicker,\n\n204\n00:10:13.769 --> 00:10:16.040\nthat's where I get my formats.\n\n205\n00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:21.024\nYou can also add arrows onto lines,\nbecause, maybe I wanted to have\n\n206\n00:10:21.024 --> 00:10:25.760\npointed arrows, or little dots\nin between or on the ends there.\n\n207\n00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.339\nYou go into so many more options\nin that arrows over here,\n\n208\n00:10:29.339 --> 00:10:31.364\nif you drop down behind my head.\n\n209\n00:10:31.364 --> 00:10:37.020\nYou can see we have like the cup type and\njoint type and the beginning and endings.\n\n210\n00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:39.714\nAnd like, do you want,\nhow you want your dashes to be.\n\n211\n00:10:39.714 --> 00:10:44.410\nCompound path, there's a lot\nof fun stuffs that you can do.\n\n212\n00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:48.610\nWith any of your shapes, whether it\nbe lines or circles and squares.\n\n213\n00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:53.234\nTo where you can kinda do a lot more\nformatting than just that's available in\n\n214\n00:10:53.234 --> 00:10:54.400\nthese drop downs.\n\n215\n00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:58.548\nSo, definitely check that out, and\nit could be kind of fun for you.\n\n216\n00:10:58.548 --> 00:11:04.150\nOne thing about the lines that I think is\nneat, is that you can use them to connect.\n\n217\n00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:09.146\nHere, I'm gonna just kinda get like\na blank piece of paper, if you wanna say.\n\n218\n00:11:09.146 --> 00:11:13.940\nIf I insert a couple,\nlet's do a couple of squares, right?\n\n219\n00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.578\nI'm gonna click, hold, and drag once.\n\n220\n00:11:15.578 --> 00:11:21.400\nThen, I'm gonna use my Alt key to go ahead\nand drag, and make a few more, right?\n\n221\n00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.983\nThat looks, that looks good, perfect.\n\n222\n00:11:23.983 --> 00:11:27.820\nYou can use your Line Tool\nto connect them.\n\n223\n00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.044\nKinda like,\nif you were making a flow chart, right?\n\n224\n00:11:30.044 --> 00:11:34.870\nAnd I was, like, from here to here,\nI can take my line, okay?\n\n225\n00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:37.360\nAnd then, notice how it highlights.\n\n226\n00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.500\nThese little green dots on my shapes.\n\n227\n00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:44.922\nIt's finding the points,\nand then, connecting them.\n\n228\n00:11:44.922 --> 00:11:47.860\nSo if I click, hold and,\nwow, you know what?\n\n229\n00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:51.582\nCuz I'm zoomed in, that's why it's\nfreaking out, let me undo that.\n\n230\n00:11:51.582 --> 00:11:57.150\nAnd let's try that, okay,\ncome on, you can do it.\n\n231\n00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.048\nLet's try it again, and\nnot be zoomed in [LAUGH].\n\n232\n00:11:59.048 --> 00:12:04.350\nI will take my line tool,\nthere we go, click hold, and drag.\n\n233\n00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:07.216\nAnd notice, it kinda like snaps itself.\n\n234\n00:12:07.216 --> 00:12:11.655\nBut I can I could snap it to that, but\nI probably just go ahead on that one.\n\n235\n00:12:11.655 --> 00:12:14.845\nAnd so now I've connected that line.\n\n236\n00:12:14.845 --> 00:12:19.599\nAnd you can also keep going,\nI could go back to my line, and then,\n\n237\n00:12:19.599 --> 00:12:21.342\nconnect this to there.\n\n238\n00:12:21.342 --> 00:12:24.492\nJust kinda fun and\nthen notice how I wanna move them around,\n\n239\n00:12:24.492 --> 00:12:27.332\nthere going to be connected,\nbecause I've told it.\n\n240\n00:12:27.332 --> 00:12:30.340\nHey, it's not just\ndrawing a line by itself.\n\n241\n00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:32.934\nThey are connecting to other shapes.\n\n242\n00:12:32.934 --> 00:12:37.070\nSo, this would be kinda neat if you\nwere trying to draw a diagram or\n\n243\n00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:41.630\na flow chart or any thing like that and\nfinding where they connect.\n\n244\n00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:43.070\n&gt;&gt; So, if we connect these to shapes,\n\n245\n00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:45.817\ndo we still have the capabilities\nof changing the ends of the lines?\n\n246\n00:12:45.817 --> 00:12:48.820\nCan I put like the blob and\nthe arrow and it still show up?\n\n247\n00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.094\nOr is it gonna be hidden\nby the shape if I do this?\n\n248\n00:12:50.094 --> 00:12:53.080\n&gt;&gt; You know, that's a good question.\n\n249\n00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.865\nI don't, let's try it, okay?\n\n250\n00:12:54.865 --> 00:13:01.120\nLet's go with the arrows, and go with\nthe dots, and no, there are the dots.\n\n251\n00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.365\nSo, I honestly wasn't expecting that.\n\n252\n00:13:02.365 --> 00:13:06.790\nSo, I was expecting it to either not\nbe an option or it just not apply.\n\n253\n00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:07.500\nSo, your answer is yes.\n\n254\n00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:11.055\nYou can have the arrow ends while\nthey're connected to your shapes.\n\n255\n00:13:11.055 --> 00:13:14.065\n&gt;&gt; And then, that's great, because,\nif you are building a flow chart or\n\n256\n00:13:14.065 --> 00:13:15.985\nsomething that has a particular direction.\n\n257\n00:13:15.985 --> 00:13:19.499\nYou want to give some subtle\nindications like, start here and\n\n258\n00:13:19.499 --> 00:13:21.460\nthen move forward, right?\n\n259\n00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:25.056\nSo, maybe you're using this to\nillustrate a process in Excel.\n\n260\n00:13:25.056 --> 00:13:28.151\nAnd then, right down, below it,\nyou have estimation of cost for\n\n261\n00:13:28.151 --> 00:13:29.610\nthe expected process.\n\n262\n00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:31.773\nSo, if you're like,\nwhy would I reuse shapes?\n\n263\n00:13:31.773 --> 00:13:36.144\nYou might be some kind of maybe it's a\nsimple graphical one If you've got a crazy\n\n264\n00:13:36.144 --> 00:13:38.830\nflow chart like some kind\nof corporate process.\n\n265\n00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:42.051\nI don't know if I'd spend a whole\nlot of time doing it here.\n\n266\n00:13:42.051 --> 00:13:46.220\nBut, if you have something simple,\nand you wanna give a cost estimation.\n\n267\n00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:50.032\nThis would be a nice,\ncomplementary set of things to do.\n\n268\n00:13:50.032 --> 00:13:53.140\n&gt;&gt; Yes, because, graphical\nrepresentations of our data is huge.\n\n269\n00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:54.781\nEverybody wants to see things in pictures.\n\n270\n00:13:54.781 --> 00:13:57.460\nSometimes, it's easier to process this.\n\n271\n00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:01.051\nAnd actually, you just made me realize,\nyou taught me something,\n\n272\n00:14:01.051 --> 00:14:02.445\nI was not expecting that.\n\n273\n00:14:02.445 --> 00:14:08.390\nSo, hey, I will say,\nI don't know everything about Excel.\n\n274\n00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:13.615\nI know a lot, but, there are some little\nthings that I'm kinda surprised right now.\n\n275\n00:14:13.615 --> 00:14:16.320\nSo, I got a like ooh, that's kinda fun.\n\n276\n00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.734\nLet's move on to, like you were saying,\nI want to designate.\n\n277\n00:14:18.734 --> 00:14:25.800\nHey, these are our costs and this is our\nexpenses, or something to that effect.\n\n278\n00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.530\nNow mind you,\nwe are going to be getting into smart art.\n\n279\n00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:30.566\nAnd when you get into smart art,\n\n280\n00:14:30.566 --> 00:14:35.630\nadding graphical representation of your\ndata, that might be a little easier.\n\n281\n00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:39.885\nBut, like you were saying, something super\nquick, this to this, shows your point,\n\n282\n00:14:39.885 --> 00:14:40.540\nwonderful.\n\n283\n00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.580\nIf I wanna add text into a shape,\nall you've gotta do.\n\n284\n00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:48.405\nThis is one that kind of,\npeople always ask me how to do this.\n\n285\n00:14:48.405 --> 00:14:50.370\nAnd then when I show them,\nthey're like, really?\n\n286\n00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:51.579\nThat's all it was, it's that easy?\n\n287\n00:14:51.579 --> 00:14:53.390\nI'm like, yeah, I know.\n\n288\n00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:55.437\nCuz you want to make it more\ncomplicated than it is.\n\n289\n00:14:55.437 --> 00:15:00.089\nIf I wanna add text to the circle, all I\ndo is select it and just start typing,\n\n290\n00:15:00.089 --> 00:15:00.910\nthat's it.\n\n291\n00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:03.813\nThere's no button like Add Text,\ndo, right?\n\n292\n00:15:03.813 --> 00:15:06.530\nJustin just went like this,\nlike aw, really?\n\n293\n00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:08.597\n&gt;&gt; Most of the time,\nI try double click to get a cursor.\n\n294\n00:15:11.151 --> 00:15:13.746\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; At least they're making it easy,\n\n295\n00:15:13.746 --> 00:15:16.994\ncuz that's one of the struggles if you\nare making some of these kinda flows or\n\n296\n00:15:16.994 --> 00:15:17.840\nwhatever.\n\n297\n00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.930\nIs I need a little bit of text in these.\n\n298\n00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:23.750\nAll right, let me,\ndouble at right click, edit.\n\n299\n00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.457\nI can be a pain, so\nI'm glad you just select it, it's done.\n\n300\n00:15:27.457 --> 00:15:33.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just type and\nI say this is text in a shape.\n\n301\n00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.544\nOkay, so I've watched people like that.\n\n302\n00:15:35.544 --> 00:15:39.920\nThey'll take a text box, and then,\nput that on top of the shape.\n\n303\n00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.850\nAnd like, you don't need to do that,\njust put the text right in the shade.\n\n304\n00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:46.377\nI'm like I don't know how, my God [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna actually recommend against\n\n305\n00:15:46.377 --> 00:15:48.635\nthat text box thing, absolute nightmare.\n\n306\n00:15:48.635 --> 00:15:51.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You go, I wanna move this.\n\n307\n00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:53.872\nMy text, I know you can group things,\nI think, right?\n\n308\n00:15:53.872 --> 00:15:59.804\nMaybe I'm jumping ahead here, But if you\nforget, then you go let me just move this.\n\n309\n00:15:59.804 --> 00:16:01.730\nAll my stuff has jacked up now.\n\n310\n00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:04.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly,\nyou want that text to stay with it.\n\n311\n00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:07.010\nNow, once you have like that's really\nsmall, I can't even see that, Vonne.\n\n312\n00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:08.000\nI know, I'm sorry.\n\n313\n00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.571\nBut we can go ahead and select this text.\n\n314\n00:16:10.571 --> 00:16:13.485\nNow, notice that's where I do\nhave the I-beam come up, so\n\n315\n00:16:13.485 --> 00:16:14.780\nI could select this text.\n\n316\n00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:17.440\nAnd now if it's text,\nyou just go back over to the Home tab.\n\n317\n00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.570\nThat's the other biggest thing is\njust remembering what tab does what?\n\n318\n00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:22.394\nYou have to kinda jump around\nthe ribbon a little bit.\n\n319\n00:16:22.394 --> 00:16:26.552\nSo if I wanna make this 36-point font and\n\n320\n00:16:26.552 --> 00:16:31.412\nthen make this text yellow,\nwell, that's not.\n\n321\n00:16:31.412 --> 00:16:34.318\n[LAUGH] That would be here, there we go.\n\n322\n00:16:34.318 --> 00:16:37.340\nAnd so now I've got text in a shape, cool.\n\n323\n00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.430\nBut the thing is for me, this text,\n\n324\n00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:43.570\nyou see it's kinda up towards\nthe top of the circle?\n\n325\n00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:44.695\nI don't like that.\n\n326\n00:16:44.695 --> 00:16:47.827\nSo once you start adding text into shapes,\n\n327\n00:16:47.827 --> 00:16:52.009\nyou need to go into the Format Pane and\nbe able to get into.\n\n328\n00:16:52.009 --> 00:16:54.250\nNotice there's two buttons right here.\n\n329\n00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:55.731\nThere's Shape Options.\n\n330\n00:16:55.731 --> 00:17:00.540\nSo doing things like Fill and\nLine, and then Effects.\n\n331\n00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:03.830\nThose are all like the edges and\nthe glows that we could go through and\n\n332\n00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:05.920\ndo all the different sliders that we want.\n\n333\n00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:10.681\nOr if I go over to the text options,\nI have different buttons now.\n\n334\n00:17:10.681 --> 00:17:16.090\nNow, this is the Fill and\nOutline for the text.\n\n335\n00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:20.640\nThis is the effect for the text.\n\n336\n00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:21.945\nThis is going to come in.\n\n337\n00:17:21.945 --> 00:17:23.522\nSo this is the one that you want.\n\n338\n00:17:23.522 --> 00:17:25.920\nSo Format Shape &gt; Text Options.\n\n339\n00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.790\nThis button, which is right here,\nwhich is text box.\n\n340\n00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.550\nLook at all these, okay?\n\n341\n00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:32.004\nWe have top alignment.\n\n342\n00:17:32.004 --> 00:17:34.010\nThat's what it's defaulting to.\n\n343\n00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:36.020\nNo, I want that to put\nthat into the middle.\n\n344\n00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:38.430\nI'm already feeling better right now.\n\n345\n00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:39.647\nWhere do I want the text direction?\n\n346\n00:17:39.647 --> 00:17:41.253\nI'm not sure I want that,\n\n347\n00:17:41.253 --> 00:17:45.870\nbut you see this is where you can\nformat your text within your shape.\n\n348\n00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:48.040\nResize shape to fit text.\n\n349\n00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.770\nThat's kinda neat, I'm gonna undo that.\n\n350\n00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:56.290\nAllow text to overflow the shape,\nI don't know if I like that.\n\n351\n00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:58.920\nMargins within the shape itself.\n\n352\n00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.677\nYou could go ahead and this will\nbe more if you had rectangles and\n\n353\n00:18:01.677 --> 00:18:02.900\nprobably a little bit better.\n\n354\n00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:06.565\nBut the margins inside are what we\nwill call padding for the most part.\n\n355\n00:18:06.565 --> 00:18:09.969\nYou could go ahead and\nbump it off the edges of the shapes.\n\n356\n00:18:09.969 --> 00:18:12.594\nWell, it'll do something for it here.\n\n357\n00:18:12.594 --> 00:18:14.550\nBut again, this is a circle,\nit's not a square.\n\n358\n00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:15.710\nIt might be a little bit different.\n\n359\n00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:19.405\nAnd wrap text in the shape\nversus not wrapping it.\n\n360\n00:18:19.405 --> 00:18:21.686\nYou could even put in columns and\neverything.\n\n361\n00:18:21.686 --> 00:18:25.010\nThat's getting a little too crazy for\nExcel necessarily.\n\n362\n00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:29.320\nBut this button is another one that people\nare like I just wanna move it down.\n\n363\n00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:30.701\nThat's where you get it.\n\n364\n00:18:30.701 --> 00:18:36.300\n&gt;&gt; And that's one of those things with\nmargin when you have alternative shapes.\n\n365\n00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:37.858\nYou go well, I'm just gonna change this.\n\n366\n00:18:37.858 --> 00:18:39.305\nYou have to be careful.\n\n367\n00:18:39.305 --> 00:18:43.670\nI've got an inkling feeling that this is\nbased on the bounding box of the shape.\n\n368\n00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:45.519\nAnd not the actually shape.\n\n369\n00:18:45.519 --> 00:18:49.700\nSo you may get weird results,\nespecially with that irregular shapes.\n\n370\n00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:52.580\nCircle in this case is even irregular,\nbecause well,\n\n371\n00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:55.670\nthere's portions of the bounding\nbox that aren't part of the circle.\n\n372\n00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:57.770\nSo just be careful in those capacities.\n\n373\n00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:58.490\n&gt;&gt; That is true.\n\n374\n00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:01.587\nI mean, if you try to do this on a star or\na heart, you can get really weird.\n\n375\n00:19:01.587 --> 00:19:04.343\nAnd the other thing is I wanna\nput it on the middle but\n\n376\n00:19:04.343 --> 00:19:06.600\nit's not really in the middle.\n\n377\n00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:12.682\nAnd that's again where the shape makes it\nlook like it's not in the center of it,\n\n378\n00:19:12.682 --> 00:19:13.498\nbut it is.\n\n379\n00:19:13.498 --> 00:19:16.640\nAnd there it goes back to that math,\nright?\n\n380\n00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.940\nMathematically, it is centering it.\n\n381\n00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.820\nBut so\nit can be a little weird when you get into\n\n382\n00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:27.970\noutside of a shape like a square or\na circle and so on and so forth, cool.\n\n383\n00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:31.330\nAnd that's why you have\nthis whole other section up\n\n384\n00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:33.323\nhere on the shape format toolbar.\n\n385\n00:19:33.323 --> 00:19:36.640\nThat would be the tab on the ribbon sorry.\n\n386\n00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:41.359\nBut you can go ahead and add different,\nlike Word Art styles to the text and\n\n387\n00:19:41.359 --> 00:19:42.366\nthen the film.\n\n388\n00:19:42.366 --> 00:19:46.623\nText can go probably don't want\npink text on a pink shape.\n\n389\n00:19:46.623 --> 00:19:49.120\nSo let's go ahead and\nmake that a yellow again.\n\n390\n00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:52.510\nAnd then all the different things\nthat you can have on this.\n\n391\n00:19:52.510 --> 00:20:00.635\nSo that's why there's text formatting\nin the shape tab on the ribbon.\n\n392\n00:20:00.635 --> 00:20:02.100\nOkay, so fun stuff.\n\n393\n00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.785\nWe'll talk about arranging and\neverything in another episode.\n\n394\n00:20:04.785 --> 00:20:07.600\nWell, we'll keep that for later so.\n\n395\n00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:08.666\nLots of fun stuff.\n\n396\n00:20:08.666 --> 00:20:13.559\nLet's go a little bit into that task\npane and the gradients for a little bit,\n\n397\n00:20:13.559 --> 00:20:15.490\ncuz I love my gradient.\n\n398\n00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:16.793\nAnd you can put this on.\n\n399\n00:20:16.793 --> 00:20:20.488\nThe gradients can be applied\nto the outline of a shape,\n\n400\n00:20:20.488 --> 00:20:24.679\noutline of a text, the inside of the text,\ninside of a shape.\n\n401\n00:20:24.679 --> 00:20:28.244\nSo the way that I'm gonna show\nyou how to manipulate making\n\n402\n00:20:28.244 --> 00:20:33.136\nyour own gradients applies in any place\nwhere it says can you choose a gradient?\n\n403\n00:20:33.136 --> 00:20:36.200\nSo let's take this square and\nlet's come back over.\n\n404\n00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:40.310\nMake sure I'm on the Shape Options\nwithin the Format Shape task pane.\n\n405\n00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:41.456\nAnd then I come into the Fill.\n\n406\n00:20:41.456 --> 00:20:44.520\nAnd if I drop this down,\nnotice that I have.\n\n407\n00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.698\nI can use this Solid Fills and\nthe pattern fills in the gradients, but\n\n408\n00:20:48.698 --> 00:20:53.110\nwhen I chose gradient as opposed to\nwhen I was doing it here on the ribbon.\n\n409\n00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:56.590\nRemember, there just wasn't\nas many options down here.\n\n410\n00:20:56.590 --> 00:21:01.616\nWhen I go to the gradient fill here,\nI have what is called the gradient ramp.\n\n411\n00:21:01.616 --> 00:21:06.790\nOkay, this ramp has different\nstops along the way.\n\n412\n00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:08.034\nAnd notice these little triangles.\n\n413\n00:21:08.034 --> 00:21:11.313\nI call them houses,\nbecause to me they look like houses.\n\n414\n00:21:11.313 --> 00:21:14.870\nSo each one of them you can control.\n\n415\n00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:15.962\nThere are some presets.\n\n416\n00:21:15.962 --> 00:21:20.160\nBut again, that's back to just solid\ncolors and I don't really like that.\n\n417\n00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:24.055\nThere's different ways that it can go,\nLinear, Radial, and so on and so forth.\n\n418\n00:21:24.055 --> 00:21:25.457\nBut I really wanna change them.\n\n419\n00:21:25.457 --> 00:21:29.430\nSo you take a house, right,\nand you can move them too.\n\n420\n00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:31.992\nAnd then you come down here to Color.\n\n421\n00:21:31.992 --> 00:21:34.903\nAnd I can choose things\nlike I wanna make it pink.\n\n422\n00:21:34.903 --> 00:21:36.980\nOoh, we're already getting pretty.\n\n423\n00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:41.300\nSo then I can take this house and\nI wanna make this yellow.\n\n424\n00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:44.467\nAnd I wanna take this house and\nI wanna make it green.\n\n425\n00:21:44.467 --> 00:21:46.840\nAnd this is where you\ncan have a lot of fun.\n\n426\n00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.500\nNotice you can start\nmoving the houses around.\n\n427\n00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:53.210\nYou can start really formatting\nthem to be some pretty rainbows and\n\n428\n00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:54.480\nall that kind of fun stuff.\n\n429\n00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.920\nIt's really neat to go ahead and\nmake your own.\n\n430\n00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:00.160\nBut maybe I don't really\nwant this green anymore.\n\n431\n00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.429\nHow can I take it off?\n\n432\n00:22:01.429 --> 00:22:07.160\nAnd it's really small you see there's like\na tiny little orange outline around it?\n\n433\n00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:12.050\nThat indicates which house or\ncolor stuff that you're formatting.\n\n434\n00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:13.055\nYou can take it off.\n\n435\n00:22:13.055 --> 00:22:15.485\nI can just remove that particular one.\n\n436\n00:22:15.485 --> 00:22:19.690\nOr if I wanna add one back in,\nthen you can go ahead and add it back in.\n\n437\n00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:23.920\nI can move them around to where some\ncolors don't blend as well together.\n\n438\n00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:27.630\nSo I would try to keep them\nthat look a little bit nicer.\n\n439\n00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:29.220\nSo then I can take this, move it off.\n\n440\n00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:30.605\nMaybe add one more, because you know what?\n\n441\n00:22:30.605 --> 00:22:35.440\nYou gotta have some purple\nat the end of our rainbow.\n\n442\n00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:36.834\nSo there we go, I love it.\n\n443\n00:22:36.834 --> 00:22:38.410\nI think it's beautiful.\n\n444\n00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:40.520\nI can make my own gradients.\n\n445\n00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:44.290\nI can then change the angle\nof them if I wanted to.\n\n446\n00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:46.356\nI can make the direction change.\n\n447\n00:22:46.356 --> 00:22:51.472\nSo you have a lot of fun stuff that you\ncan do with formatting your gradients and\n\n448\n00:22:51.472 --> 00:22:56.610\nyour shapes, whether you want to do,\nnotice they have it as a gradient line.\n\n449\n00:22:56.610 --> 00:23:00.125\nSo I could do the same thing for\nthe outside or\n\n450\n00:23:00.125 --> 00:23:03.530\nthe stroke outline versus the inside.\n\n451\n00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:05.940\nYou can do that with your text outlines.\n\n452\n00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:07.992\nSo Gradients, I love them.\n\n453\n00:23:07.992 --> 00:23:08.792\nYou know what?\n\n454\n00:23:08.792 --> 00:23:10.780\nI just like rainbows.\n\n455\n00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:11.409\nI like lots of colors.\n\n456\n00:23:11.409 --> 00:23:17.220\nSo [LAUGH] I wanna show you guys\nthat within the format task pane.\n\n457\n00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:21.730\nAnd you can go to it any time you\nfeel you need a little bit more\n\n458\n00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:23.020\ncolor in your life too.\n\n459\n00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:27.200\n&gt;&gt; And I think maybe this shouldn't\nbe said, but I feel compelled,\n\n460\n00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.920\ncuz I know I struggle with things.\n\n461\n00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.820\nIf the stroke of a line, the outline or\n\n462\n00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:35.360\nwhatever, is not large enough, you may\nnot actually see much about it, right?\n\n463\n00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:39.210\nThis tiny little what's the smallest,\n1.1 or something?\n\n464\n00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:40.878\n&gt;&gt; I think it's half or something, right?\n\n465\n00:23:40.878 --> 00:23:42.423\n&gt;&gt; Something which is tiny.\n\n466\n00:23:42.423 --> 00:23:43.890\n&gt;&gt; A quarter of a point.\n\n467\n00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:45.652\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you may not see anything, right?\n\n468\n00:23:45.652 --> 00:23:46.443\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n469\n00:23:46.443 --> 00:23:47.050\n&gt;&gt; So typically,\n\n470\n00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:49.812\nwhen you're doing gradients or\nsomething special like that adding.\n\n471\n00:23:49.812 --> 00:23:53.186\nThose are gonna be thicker lines\nthat you want to accentuate.\n\n472\n00:23:53.186 --> 00:23:54.310\nAnd now you can see them.\n\n473\n00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:55.817\nSo it's something to remember.\n\n474\n00:23:55.817 --> 00:24:02.470\nNow, Vonne, I feel like we've done a lot,\nnot enough.\n\n475\n00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:05.590\nBut do we have anything else that we need\nto consider when it comes to shapes and\n\n476\n00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:06.850\nformatting thereof?\n\n477\n00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:10.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we have a couple of fun\nlittle things that I wanna show you.\n\n478\n00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.230\nSo this gets into making\nyour Office products\n\n479\n00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:16.520\nalmost work like a vector program.\n\n480\n00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:21.200\nBy the way, really quick,\nyou have raster information, pixels.\n\n481\n00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.820\nYour photographs are raster or\nbitmap, whatever.\n\n482\n00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:25.920\nIt's just a bunch of pixels.\n\n483\n00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:29.680\nWhen you have vector information,\nvector does not have any pixels.\n\n484\n00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:32.873\nIt's just lines or points and strokes.\n\n485\n00:24:32.873 --> 00:24:36.061\nIt's all bunch of math, right?\n\n486\n00:24:36.061 --> 00:24:40.921\nOkay, so this is where and\nwe're essentially creating vectors,\n\n487\n00:24:40.921 --> 00:24:43.451\nthey are vectors, in the shapes.\n\n488\n00:24:43.451 --> 00:24:46.005\nBut you can manipulate them.\n\n489\n00:24:46.005 --> 00:24:47.479\nLet me show you.\n\n490\n00:24:47.479 --> 00:24:48.532\nSo we have a square, right?\n\n491\n00:24:48.532 --> 00:24:50.715\nAnd let's take this square right here.\n\n492\n00:24:50.715 --> 00:24:55.460\nOkay, so a square has four sides.\n\n493\n00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:58.330\nWhich means, it has four points.\n\n494\n00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.990\nIf I brought in a triangle,\n\n495\n00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:04.320\nthis is bringing me back to\ngeometry class, love geometry.\n\n496\n00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:07.700\nSo we have this,\nthen a triangle is three points.\n\n497\n00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:11.280\nSo if I take and do, here,\nI'll just take this circle.\n\n498\n00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:15.210\nI'm just gonna go ahead and copy and\nthen down here I'm gonna paste.\n\n499\n00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:15.730\nA circle and\n\n500\n00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:20.520\na square are the same in the sense\nthat they only have four points, okay?\n\n501\n00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.690\nBut that's a circle,\nthat doesn't have any points.\n\n502\n00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:29.960\nIt does, but it has directions and\nhow that path travels out of that point.\n\n503\n00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:35.344\nAnd what you can do in your shapes\nis you can come over to this button,\n\n504\n00:25:35.344 --> 00:25:37.800\nand you can go into Edit the points.\n\n505\n00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:42.479\nAnd when I click on this,\nnotice if I zoom in a little bit.\n\n506\n00:25:42.479 --> 00:25:48.230\nThese points now become where I get this\nlike kinda little directional handle.\n\n507\n00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:51.630\nI can manipulate each one\nof them individually.\n\n508\n00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:54.660\nSo I can make this more of like a diamond.\n\n509\n00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:57.134\nBut then once you click on the point,\nyou can move the point.\n\n510\n00:25:57.134 --> 00:26:00.110\nDo you see these kinda like\nwhite things right here?\n\n511\n00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:02.240\nThese are your Bezier handles.\n\n512\n00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.590\nThese are where you can\nactually take this and change.\n\n513\n00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:10.390\nYou can change the direction\nof how that path travels\n\n514\n00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:14.660\nout of that point taking\nit from a square point.\n\n515\n00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:17.350\nOr a straight point to a curved point,\nokay?\n\n516\n00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:19.900\nAgain, a lot more stuff\nwith vector information.\n\n517\n00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.900\nYou can pull this out, move it in.\n\n518\n00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:24.350\nAnd this is just where\nyou can go ahead and\n\n519\n00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:28.915\nstart making some really\ninteresting claw like thing.\n\n520\n00:26:28.915 --> 00:26:31.530\n[LAUGH] I'm thinking like an animal claw.\n\n521\n00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:34.100\nThis is like a cat claw,\nlike their little toenails.\n\n522\n00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:38.596\n&gt;&gt; It's funny that you say that, because\nI thought it was an upside down recliner.\n\n523\n00:26:38.596 --> 00:26:40.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n524\n00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:43.496\nmaybe we want different\nthings in our lives, Vonne.\n\n525\n00:26:43.496 --> 00:26:47.189\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Is it the blot test that is-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] Rorschach testing?\n\n526\n00:26:47.189 --> 00:26:47.793\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n527\n00:26:47.793 --> 00:26:48.940\n&gt;&gt; What do you see?\n\n528\n00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:49.925\nUpside down recliner\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n529\n00:26:49.925 --> 00:26:51.900\n&gt;&gt; I see a cat claw.\n\n530\n00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:53.306\nAll right, well, there you go.\n\n531\n00:26:53.306 --> 00:26:56.840\n[LAUGH] So yes,\nyou can change each one of these points.\n\n532\n00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:58.900\nAnd that's what your circle is doing.\n\n533\n00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:03.080\nIf I go into the edit points there,\nit's just four points, but\n\n534\n00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.710\nthey have directions on them.\n\n535\n00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:06.300\nAnd that's how you can change it.\n\n536\n00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:10.600\nSo It would be kind of fun to take your\nshapes and then make upside down recliners\n\n537\n00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:16.100\nor cat claws, and take any shape and\nmanipulate it that way.\n\n538\n00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:18.650\nThe other thing that you'll see\nI actually didn't realize it,\n\n539\n00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:20.360\nthey had one on the triangle.\n\n540\n00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.964\nDo you see this yellow dot up at the top?\n\n541\n00:27:22.964 --> 00:27:26.914\nThat yellow dot will come up on\ncertain shapes, not all of them,\n\n542\n00:27:26.914 --> 00:27:30.880\ncertain shapes that will allow you\nto take it and it will let you.\n\n543\n00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:36.433\nNow, we're getting into right\ntriangles and isosceles and\n\n544\n00:27:36.433 --> 00:27:39.960\nits perfect scalene triangles,\nand all that kinda fun stuff.\n\n545\n00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.740\nSo it will allow you to change it.\n\n546\n00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:46.480\nLet me show you some other shapes\nthat this will come up on.\n\n547\n00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:49.720\nLet's go over here to the sun, okay?\n\n548\n00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.970\nSo if I, ooh, sorry, take the sun.\n\n549\n00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:55.220\nNotice there's a little yellow dot here.\n\n550\n00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:59.150\nIt's where I can make the rays longer or\nshorter.\n\n551\n00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:02.000\nSo there's some different\nways that you can\n\n552\n00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.553\nmanipulate your shapes based on that\nyellow, it used to be a diamond.\n\n553\n00:28:06.553 --> 00:28:09.430\nI guess, that's a square, isn't it?\n\n554\n00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:12.660\nSo I know another one that's\nlike the smiley face.\n\n555\n00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:15.060\nYou can make it frown, but\nwe don't want a frown face.\n\n556\n00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:17.775\nWe wanna turn that frown upside down.\n\n557\n00:28:17.775 --> 00:28:20.819\n[LAUGH] Sorry, I'm talking\nabout the power of advertising.\n\n558\n00:28:20.819 --> 00:28:24.023\nThat was the commercial back in\nthe day for Lionel Playworld,\n\n559\n00:28:24.023 --> 00:28:26.185\ndo you remember about Lionel Playworld?\n\n560\n00:28:26.185 --> 00:28:30.019\nTurn that frown [SOUND] upside down,\nremember that?\n\n561\n00:28:30.019 --> 00:28:30.659\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, but\n\n562\n00:28:30.659 --> 00:28:32.925\nI'm getting real nervous,\ncuz we don't have the rights to that.\n\n563\n00:28:32.925 --> 00:28:34.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I've heard that saying.\n\n564\n00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:36.170\nI didn't know what it was for, though.\n\n565\n00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:36.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n566\n00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:40.100\nat least that's how I remember it growing\nup watching Saturday morning cartoons.\n\n567\n00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:45.780\nSo that's what you can do with\nthe yellow dot on some of your shapes.\n\n568\n00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:47.330\nIt allows you to manipulate it.\n\n569\n00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:51.323\nYou could also go into edit the points and\nchange each one of them individually if\n\n570\n00:28:51.323 --> 00:28:53.536\nyou wanted to,\nwhich is a little bit of fun.\n\n571\n00:28:53.536 --> 00:28:56.880\nYou can format them, you can add text.\n\n572\n00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.010\nThis is another one.\n\n573\n00:28:58.010 --> 00:29:00.340\nIf I just wanted to add text,\nyou just start typing.\n\n574\n00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:03.250\nOoh, that one is a little weird,\ndid it go in the text, did it?\n\n575\n00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:03.770\nYou know what?\n\n576\n00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:05.600\nBecause I edited the points.\n\n577\n00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.710\nAnd it got all freaked\nout it couldn't find it,\n\n578\n00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:10.090\ncuz it took it out of its normal part.\n\n579\n00:29:11.519 --> 00:29:12.725\nSomething else to be aware of.\n\n580\n00:29:12.725 --> 00:29:16.475\nYou might not wanna do that if you're\ngonna be adding some text on top of it.\n\n581\n00:29:16.475 --> 00:29:21.161\nThen, you might wanna go to adding your\ntext box and manipulating it differently.\n\n582\n00:29:21.161 --> 00:29:27.043\nMeaning, insert the text box.\n\n583\n00:29:27.043 --> 00:29:29.517\nThere it is,\n[LAUGH] that big one that says text.\n\n584\n00:29:29.517 --> 00:29:32.807\n[LAUGH] And\nthen you can add in a text box.\n\n585\n00:29:32.807 --> 00:29:36.067\nYou draw it, and\nthen you can type in your text.\n\n586\n00:29:36.067 --> 00:29:41.338\nThe thing is here you would have\nto get the edge, not the I-beam.\n\n587\n00:29:41.338 --> 00:29:43.303\nYou gotta find the edge.\n\n588\n00:29:43.303 --> 00:29:47.833\nAnd if I put that on top,\nnotice when you do a text box,\n\n589\n00:29:47.833 --> 00:29:50.833\nit's really just the shape\nwith text inside of it.\n\n590\n00:29:50.833 --> 00:29:55.323\nThis is a rectangle, cuz notice it\nbrings up a shape contextual tab.\n\n591\n00:29:55.323 --> 00:29:58.812\nYou would have to take the no fill.\n\n592\n00:29:58.812 --> 00:30:02.980\nYou would then have to go ahead and\ndo some of your formattings on this and\n\n593\n00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:05.560\neverything, and then you can manipulate.\n\n594\n00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:07.720\nYou can change how this wraps around.\n\n595\n00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:10.321\nYou would have to take the outline off,\nbut\n\n596\n00:30:10.321 --> 00:30:13.220\nthere's nothing wrong\nwith doing it this way.\n\n597\n00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:15.753\nEspecially, if I needed\ntext in that sun and\n\n598\n00:30:15.753 --> 00:30:19.480\nthis is the only way I can accomplish it,\ngo right ahead.\n\n599\n00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:24.210\nAll right, just remember, you have to\ngrab from the four-pointed arrows.\n\n600\n00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:25.896\nOops, okay, how about we go ahead and\n\n601\n00:30:25.896 --> 00:30:28.290\ndo the four-pointed arrows\nthere to move it around?\n\n602\n00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:33.420\nBut you still have the same options\nyou have with your rectangles,\n\n603\n00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:36.080\nbecause that really is what a text box is.\n\n604\n00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.110\nIt's a rectangle with text in it.\n\n605\n00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:41.215\nAnd then you can format it the same\nway with moving it down and\n\n606\n00:30:41.215 --> 00:30:43.890\nchange the alignment of your\ntext within that shape.\n\n607\n00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:47.230\nSo if you ever wanted to,\nyou can go back and do it that way.\n\n608\n00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:50.760\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne, thank you so much for\nkind of crushing my dreams there.\n\n609\n00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:54.847\nI thought text boxes were special, but\nthey're just shapes with text in them,\n\n610\n00:30:54.847 --> 00:30:56.580\nremove the fill cut.\n\n611\n00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:58.845\nAnyway, that's neither here nor there, but\n\n612\n00:30:58.845 --> 00:31:02.800\nwe did observe something that happened\nto Vonne with that text box on the sun.\n\n613\n00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:05.160\nTry to move the sun,\ntext box stayed behind.\n\n614\n00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:08.040\nSo we got more things to talk\nabout when it comes to shapes, but\n\n615\n00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.340\nwe're out of time for this episode.\n\n616\n00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:10.870\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n617\n00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:13.700\nSo signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n618\n00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:14.670\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n619\n00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:15.610\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n620\n00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:18.049\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

exciting episode of OfficeProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.842 --> 00:00:17.081\nI'm your host Justin Dennison.\n\n5\n00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:20.912\nAnd we're coming back at you with\nmore Excel 2016 advanced for Mac.\n\n6\n00:00:20.912 --> 00:00:25.391\nAnd, well, in this episode, we're gonna\nbe looking at just some basics of images.\n\n7\n00:00:25.391 --> 00:00:29.718\nAnd every time I say basics, I get\na little wary because sometimes we tend to\n\n8\n00:00:29.718 --> 00:00:32.689\noversimplify something\nthat could be difficult.\n\n9\n00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.265\nBut luckily,\nwe have someone to take us by the hand and\n\n10\n00:00:35.265 --> 00:00:38.790\nlead us through the forest of images,\nthe one and only Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n11\n00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.650\nHow you doing today, Vonne?\n\n12\n00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.100\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic, how are you doing?\n\n13\n00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.900\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic as well.\n\n14\n00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.665\nIt's starting to get\na little warmer around here.\n\n15\n00:00:44.665 --> 00:00:49.627\nAnd, well, I'm kind of interested to not\ngo outside because of my fair skin but\n\n16\n00:00:49.627 --> 00:00:52.592\ninstead learn a little\nmore about well Excel and\n\n17\n00:00:52.592 --> 00:00:55.207\nimages, it seems like an odd topic to me.\n\n18\n00:00:55.207 --> 00:00:56.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm the same way.\n\n19\n00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.860\nThe sun it's like, gosh, it's scary.\n\n20\n00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.240\nAnd who knows, you might be watching this\nepisode in the middle of a snowstorm.\n\n21\n00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.240\nAnd you're just like,\nit's getting warm outside?\n\n22\n00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.410\nYeah, but that's when we're filming it.\n\n23\n00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.890\nAnd yes,\nwe are gonna be talking about some images.\n\n24\n00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.490\nAnd this might be kinda weird, like,\nhm, I'm talking about images in Excel?\n\n25\n00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.620\nWell, yeah, because we're starting a topic\n\n26\n00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.770\ncalled graphical elements, and\nwhat are graphical elements?\n\n27\n00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.610\nShapes, pictures, smart art,\nthose kinds of things.\n\n28\n00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.080\nEven we have a whole series on charts.\n\n29\n00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.037\nCharts are just graphical\nrepresentations of your data.\n\n30\n00:01:31.037 --> 00:01:34.468\nSo understanding how to\nwork work with shapes and\n\n31\n00:01:34.468 --> 00:01:37.797\nimages is important even\nthough we're in Excel,\n\n32\n00:01:37.797 --> 00:01:43.344\nwhich Excel is more like number crunching\nand things like that so maybe it's like,\n\n33\n00:01:43.344 --> 00:01:49.200\nI would never put a picture into an Excel\nset an Excel, how do I say that?\n\n34\n00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.280\nExcel spreadsheet.\n\n35\n00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.050\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You finally got it, Vonne.\n\n36\n00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.890\n&gt;&gt; You knew it, what?\n\n37\n00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.240\n&gt;&gt; Excel spreadsheet, but I can see times\nwhere you may want to do this, right?\n\n38\n00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.000\nI'm using Excell to do some number\ncrunching or maybe updates.\n\n39\n00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.174\nBut it ends up being output as a report or\nsomething of that nature.\n\n40\n00:02:06.174 --> 00:02:10.480\nOr maybe I have a letterhead or There are\ntimes where I can see the utility in this\n\n41\n00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.671\nit’s just not a typical thought process\nwhen your first, you know, you got to use\n\n42\n00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:18.862\nsales for numbers, well no it can be used\nfor like reporting and things like that.\n\n43\n00:02:18.862 --> 00:02:22.507\n&gt;&gt; But I think; that’s a great example and\nhey maybe your a company logo.\n\n44\n00:02:22.507 --> 00:02:25.177\nYou need to put that up in the corner or\nwhat have you.\n\n45\n00:02:25.177 --> 00:02:27.728\nSo that’s why we’re going\nto be going over this.\n\n46\n00:02:27.728 --> 00:02:31.700\nI do talk more at length about images and\nfile formats and\n\n47\n00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.860\neverything like that in our Word series.\n\n48\n00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.470\nSo definitely check that out both for\nPC and Mac.\n\n49\n00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.869\nCuz I love to talk about images and\nI love to talk about resolution and\n\n50\n00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:43.802\nfile types and transparency and it's like,\n\n51\n00:02:43.802 --> 00:02:47.450\nthis might not be the place and\ntime for it here in Excel.\n\n52\n00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.500\nSo we're just gonna go ahead and\nshow you how you can put some images in.\n\n53\n00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.823\nSome basics, like moving it around,\nresizing it,\n\n54\n00:02:54.823 --> 00:02:59.582\ngetting familiar with how to work with\nimages within the Excel environment\n\n55\n00:02:59.582 --> 00:03:04.360\nlike our format picture task pane,\nand the ribbon, the contextual tabs.\n\n56\n00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.280\nI'm using big words,\nit sounds really scary but it's not.\n\n57\n00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.870\nIt's pretty straightforward.\n\n58\n00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.370\nIt's just insert picture,\nand that's pretty much it.\n\n59\n00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.048\nBut anyways, we wouldn't be able to\njust say that and cut the episode off.\n\n60\n00:03:15.048 --> 00:03:16.200\nI have to show you a little bit more.\n\n61\n00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.200\nSo why don't we go ahead and jump down in?\n\n62\n00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.376\nWe have my computer, just our one for\na little desktop going on.\n\n63\n00:03:22.376 --> 00:03:27.020\nSo pictures, all right,\nI said I'm gonna keep this brief so,\n\n64\n00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.540\nJustin, I'm gonna ask you to make\nsure I stay concise on this.\n\n65\n00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.680\nSo, if I said, hey,\nsend me a picture, Justin,\n\n66\n00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.930\nwhat file format do you\nequate with images?\n\n67\n00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.440\n&gt;&gt; This is a tricky question for me,\n\n68\n00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.470\njust based on my background got how\nwould you wanna a JPEG, a GIF or a GIF.\n\n69\n00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.810\nWe won't get into that.\n\n70\n00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.050\nA PNG, or do you want some more vector\nformat, like a SVG or something like that?\n\n71\n00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.150\nSo I'm pretty flexible,\nmy tendency is to look for PNG MGPs.\n\n72\n00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.850\nMainly because some of the things I do,\nI like transparent backgrounds and\n\n73\n00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.360\nJPEGs kind of limit your ability for that.\n\n74\n00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.979\n&gt;&gt; Man, you are just,\nI'm so proud right now.\n\n75\n00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:10.278\n[LAUGH] I'm so like, yay,\nyou know these things.\n\n76\n00:04:10.278 --> 00:04:13.000\nYeah, so different image file formats.\n\n77\n00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.530\nJPEG is probably one of the most\ncommon ones that people know about.\n\n78\n00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.780\nJoint Photographic Experts Group,\nin case you wanted to know what that is.\n\n79\n00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.058\nGIF or GIF, Graphical Interchange Format?\n\n80\n00:04:24.058 --> 00:04:26.419\n&gt;&gt; I think it is\na Graphics Interchange Format.\n\n81\n00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:26.919\n&gt;&gt; Graphics.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n82\n00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:28.478\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so these are different file\n\n83\n00:04:28.478 --> 00:04:30.784\nformats that support different things.\nLike you\n\n84\n00:04:30.784 --> 00:04:35.230\nwere just saying about transparency,\nright, JPEGs don't support transparency.\n\n85\n00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.570\nGIFS and PNGs or\nP-N-Gs do support transparency.\n\n86\n00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.909\nPNGs actually support multi-level\ntransparency of eight bit level\n\n87\n00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:44.740\ntransparency instead of one\nbit transparency like a GIF.\n\n88\n00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.454\nAnd you're just like, whoa, stop, Vonne.\n\n89\n00:04:46.454 --> 00:04:50.966\nI know, but it's these things that\nyou're probably haven't encountered and\n\n90\n00:04:50.966 --> 00:04:51.850\nthe white box.\n\n91\n00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.716\nThat's what I was hear people like,\nwell, it's got that white box around it.\n\n92\n00:04:55.716 --> 00:04:58.250\nYou mean a JPEG,\nas opposed to come clip art or\n\n93\n00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.535\nsome things that doesn't have\nthat white edge around it.\n\n94\n00:05:01.535 --> 00:05:05.070\nAnd you can see through and it just\ngoes right to the edge of the picture.\n\n95\n00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:10.980\nSo getting your images into those\nparticular file formats or the file\n\n96\n00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.540\nformats that can support those different\nthings, that's a whole other topic.\n\n97\n00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:19.680\nThat's either Photoshop or any other\ntype of image manipulation software\n\n98\n00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.610\nthat can do those type of things and then\nchange it into different file formats.\n\n99\n00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.400\nSo again, watch the Word shows,\nwe talk a little more about it.\n\n100\n00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.398\nI have some images that I have either\nmanipulated or sent to myself.\n\n101\n00:05:32.398 --> 00:05:36.472\nAnd you see save things like a GIF,\na JPEG, a TIF,\n\n102\n00:05:36.472 --> 00:05:41.990\na tagged image file format,\na PNG, a P-N-G, and some JPEGs.\n\n103\n00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.247\nSo then the other thing you have to\nthink about images is how big they are.\n\n104\n00:05:47.247 --> 00:05:51.651\nMeaning the amount of pixels that\nthat image is comprised of and\n\n105\n00:05:51.651 --> 00:05:56.650\nthat's where take a picture and\nmake it bigger and it looks all blurry.\n\n106\n00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.681\nWell, that's because there's not a lot\nof stuff in there to begin with.\n\n107\n00:05:59.681 --> 00:06:02.692\nAnd so when you try to make it bigger,\nit just blurs\n\n108\n00:06:02.692 --> 00:06:08.070\nit out because there's not enough pixel\ninformation to be able to manipulate it.\n\n109\n00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.620\nOr you have a picture that's so\nbig, even though it's really,\n\n110\n00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.740\nreally big in the pixel dimensions,\nyou make it this small, but\n\n111\n00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.590\nit takes forever to load or\nto print or something to that effect.\n\n112\n00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.190\nSo understanding a little\nbit about how much\n\n113\n00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.650\ninformation that's in\nthere is pretty important.\n\n114\n00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.150\nAnd you can see that over here\nwhen I'm just in my Finder,\n\n115\n00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.230\nI'm just gonna move this column over.\n\n116\n00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:36.217\nYou can see in the size, one of these\npictures is 1.3 megabits, and then,\n\n117\n00:06:36.217 --> 00:06:38.073\nor megabytes, I'm sorry.\n\n118\n00:06:38.073 --> 00:06:42.517\n[LAUGH] And then another one is like 188k.\n\n119\n00:06:42.517 --> 00:06:44.560\nThat's a pretty small image.\n\n120\n00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.970\nSo that's going to be something.\n\n121\n00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:50.102\nAnd there's something in your Mac Os,\nif you did a Cmd + I on any image, and\n\n122\n00:06:50.102 --> 00:06:54.706\nI'm zoomed out a little bit right now,\nit'll tell you the dimensions right here.\n\n123\n00:06:54.706 --> 00:07:00.575\nAbout 1,200 by 1,200 versus,\nif I go to say this particular picture and\n\n124\n00:07:00.575 --> 00:07:04.670\nlook at it,\nthat's actually not that much bigger.\n\n125\n00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.297\nLet's go down to one of these,\nokay, so you can see.\n\n126\n00:07:07.297 --> 00:07:09.696\nI was trying to find a really big one.\n\n127\n00:07:09.696 --> 00:07:10.648\nMaybe this one.\n\n128\n00:07:10.648 --> 00:07:12.553\nThere we go.\n\n129\n00:07:12.553 --> 00:07:15.107\nAnd it has all the metadata\nthat's in that as well.\n\n130\n00:07:15.107 --> 00:07:17.467\nSo there's 2,500 by 3,200.\n\n131\n00:07:17.467 --> 00:07:19.231\nThat's a lot of information.\n\n132\n00:07:19.231 --> 00:07:21.270\nSo that's gonna be a really big picture.\n\n133\n00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:24.878\nAnd that's something you see when\nyou either send it on your phone, or\n\n134\n00:07:24.878 --> 00:07:28.242\nyou email it where it actually asks\nyou about the file size right?\n\n135\n00:07:28.242 --> 00:07:32.463\nLike small, medium, large, and it usually\nputs in the parentheses the file size\n\n136\n00:07:32.463 --> 00:07:36.807\ninformation of whether you want to send a\nreally large file, or a really small file,\n\n137\n00:07:36.807 --> 00:07:40.418\nso something to think about when\nyou're sending pictures to people.\n\n138\n00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:44.647\n&gt;&gt; Now Von for the most part we're saying\n&gt;&gt; you're saying large dimension-wise,\n\n139\n00:07:44.647 --> 00:07:47.608\nwhich does have some correlation\nto respect of file size, right?\n\n140\n00:07:47.608 --> 00:07:56.306\nSo 1.3 megabyte image mostly is going\nto be bigger than a 10 kilobyte image.\n\n141\n00:07:56.306 --> 00:07:58.171\nIt gets a little shaky whenever you talk,\n\n142\n00:07:58.171 --> 00:08:00.259\nlike jpeg has different\ncompression levels.\n\n143\n00:08:00.259 --> 00:08:03.793\nYou can go, I want it to maintain\nthis big store of information, but\n\n144\n00:08:03.793 --> 00:08:05.780\ni want to apply compression filters.\n\n145\n00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:09.150\nSo, we're not necessarily digging into\nthat but for the most part you can think\n\n146\n00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:15.580\nof larger files are going to be bigger,\ndispace, transmissions.\n\n147\n00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:19.900\nSo we're talking dimension-wise ends up\nbeing, bigger on your actual hard disk.\n\n148\n00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, yeah,\nthe dimensions that you're talking about,\n\n149\n00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.270\nlike the pixels.\n\n150\n00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:27.390\nIf it's 180 by 180,\nthat's a lot smaller than 2,000 by 2,000,\n\n151\n00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:31.730\nso you can think of it in width and\nheight as well.\n\n152\n00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:34.742\nAnd with the actual disk\nspace that it is taking,\n\n153\n00:08:34.742 --> 00:08:38.052\nwith the like 180 versus\n2,000 pixels wide.\n\n154\n00:08:38.052 --> 00:08:41.769\nThis kind of gets into\na little bit of resolution,\n\n155\n00:08:41.769 --> 00:08:46.810\nresolution technically is\ndefined as pixels per inch.\n\n156\n00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:50.670\nBut that stuff's talking about like\nwhether you want like 72 PPI versus 300\n\n157\n00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:52.330\nfor commercial printing.\n\n158\n00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:56.100\nHonestly, I wouldn't worry about that to\nmuch because I don't feel like you're\n\n159\n00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.160\ngoing to be doing any type of\ncommercial printing from an excel file.\n\n160\n00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.990\nYou're just going to print it on\na regular printer in your office and\n\n161\n00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:04.060\nyou should be fine.\n\n162\n00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.710\nSo, but just know, if it's this big and\nyou try to make it bigger,\n\n163\n00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:09.080\nit will get blurry.\n\n164\n00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.990\nSo try to find images that\nare a little bit bigger and\n\n165\n00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:14.300\nif they look pretty decent on the screen.\n\n166\n00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:18.680\nThey're gonna look pretty decent when you\nprint them out, so we'll just go ahead and\n\n167\n00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.320\nkeep that right there.\n\n168\n00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.410\nNow in your MacOS I\n\n169\n00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:27.700\nhave a folder right here on my desktop\nthat I have a collection of images.\n\n170\n00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.030\nI have some JPEGs, some PNGs and\n\n171\n00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:32.970\neverything like that, but\nthere's also the photos, right?\n\n172\n00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:34.960\nYou have photos where you can go ahead,\n\n173\n00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.830\nI actually don't have\nit in my doc down here.\n\n174\n00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:40.030\nBut I'm just gonna use my\nspotlight command space bar, and\n\n175\n00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:45.170\nif I type in photos, that's another place\nthat I can go ahead and store my pictures.\n\n176\n00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:47.620\nAnd you can see that I\nhave a couple in here.\n\n177\n00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:52.300\nAlright, same cats and scenery,\npretty much all I've got going on in here.\n\n178\n00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:57.280\nSo those are the different places you\ncould put them, do you use photos versus,\n\n179\n00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.970\nwe're not going to get into any of that.\n\n180\n00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:01.752\nIt's just where do you want to store them,\nand how do you want to look at them.\n\n181\n00:10:01.752 --> 00:10:06.190\nThat's all it really works, and if you\nhave your Photostream for your iPhone, and\n\n182\n00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:11.200\nall that kind of wonderful Mac\nstuff that I love, that's great.\n\n183\n00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.750\nThose are two places that\nyou're gonna find pictures.\n\n184\n00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:17.930\nAnd, those are gonna be the two places\nthat Excel is going to give the option\n\n185\n00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:22.360\nfor, to insert an image, so let's do that.\n\n186\n00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:27.120\nI will start Excel up I will\nuse my Spotlight again,\n\n187\n00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:32.120\nand then I'm just gonna type in Excel,\nanother way of getting to it.\n\n188\n00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.580\nOpen up Excel, we're just gonna\nstart a blank new workbook.\n\n189\n00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.450\nWe don't have any particular\nfile that we're working with,\n\n190\n00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:40.540\ncuz we're going to insert a picture.\n\n191\n00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.410\nI think I said image,\nbut it's pictures, and\n\n192\n00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:46.410\nnotice with the drop down\nTwo different places.\n\n193\n00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:52.020\nDo you want to go to your photo browser,\nwhich is going to be your photos\n\n194\n00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:57.890\napplication, or do you want to go ahead\nand find it for a particular folder.\n\n195\n00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:02.780\nYou do not have insert\nonline image in Excel for\n\n196\n00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:07.170\nMac, if you've come from Excel PC\nthere's always that online image, and\n\n197\n00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:10.960\nthat's powered by the Bing image search.\n\n198\n00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.760\nThey don't have that here in our Mac, so\n\n199\n00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.720\nthose are the two different places that\nyou're going to be able to find it.\n\n200\n00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.690\nLet's go ahead and\nlook at picture from file and\n\n201\n00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:23.870\nthen, I'm already in the images folder\nbecause I was doing this before.\n\n202\n00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:24.800\nBut you would just go ahead and\n\n203\n00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.530\nnavigate out to wherever you\nhave your particular images.\n\n204\n00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:32.120\nSo if I click on Desktop and\nthen I click on Images,\n\n205\n00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:36.250\nthat's where I have my different pictures,\nand I can go ahead and find it.\n\n206\n00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:39.560\nSo let's go ahead and pick up,\nlet's go ahead and pick Mr.\n\n207\n00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:43.000\nBish, right, Mr.\nBishop Timothy, and I'll insert it.\n\n208\n00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.110\nAnd there you go,\njust kind of puts it right on the Page or\n\n209\n00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:51.970\nour spreadsheet, it is not in a particular\ncell it does not live in any cells.\n\n210\n00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:57.820\nIts like free floating\non top of the worksheet,\n\n211\n00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:02.860\nand I already moved it,\nreally intuitive to go ahead and do that.\n\n212\n00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:08.350\nSo I just point out a few things that\nhappen when I inserted image One,\n\n213\n00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.120\nit is selected right now.\n\n214\n00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.620\nHow do I know it is selected?\n\n215\n00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.680\nYou see the white dots around the corners?\n\n216\n00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.310\nThat means that I have the image selected.\n\n217\n00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:18.320\nThe other way that I\nknow that it's selected,\n\n218\n00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.750\nis cuz this little swirly\nlooking guy comes at the top.\n\n219\n00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:25.040\nThat's another kind of like, it's like\nthis little antenna, if you wanna say.\n\n220\n00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.580\nWhat that does is that goes ahead and\nrotates your image.\n\n221\n00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:34.080\nNotice my mouse cursor icons look\ndifferent when I start hovering over here,\n\n222\n00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.700\nversus here.\n\n223\n00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:39.600\nTwo pointed black arrows, versus here, so\n\n224\n00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:43.960\nthose are your resizing handles,\nwith the selected image.\n\n225\n00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:49.060\nYou also know that this image is selected,\nbecause you have a contextual tab.\n\n226\n00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:53.450\nThe contextual tab up on the ribbon\nthat brings up the picture format.\n\n227\n00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:58.891\nAll these different options that are here,\nfor this particular selected object.\n\n228\n00:12:58.891 --> 00:13:02.050\nIf I do not want to have\nthis selected anymore,\n\n229\n00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:05.779\nI just click off into a blank\ncell within my worksheet.\n\n230\n00:13:05.779 --> 00:13:10.225\nAnd then notice the contextual tab goes\naway, the little resizing handles go away,\n\n231\n00:13:10.225 --> 00:13:12.240\nand then you don't have it selected.\n\n232\n00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:14.440\nHow do I select it?\n\n233\n00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:18.130\nJustin, how do you think I'm\ngoing to select this image?\n\n234\n00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:20.630\n&gt;&gt; Click on it.\n\n235\n00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:22.650\n&gt;&gt; Correct,\nyeah that was a hard one wasn't it?\n\n236\n00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:24.740\nYeah it's again, pretty intuitive.\n\n237\n00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:28.310\nYou just go ahead and select it, but\ndo take notice that your mouse cursor\n\n238\n00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:32.390\nicon looks like a four pointed arrow,\nwith a little half arrow head on there.\n\n239\n00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:36.400\nSo you single click it, you don't need\nto double click it, single click it.\n\n240\n00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:40.550\nNow it is selected, and you also have\nthe four pointed arrow that means move.\n\n241\n00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:45.200\nSo that's what I was doing by click\nhold and drag and move it across.\n\n242\n00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.560\nIt all seems really basic and\nvery intuitive,\n\n243\n00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:53.080\nespecially since we work with objects and\nall sorts of products, so\n\n244\n00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.950\nyou're just like,\nwow this is really basic.\n\n245\n00:13:55.950 --> 00:14:00.370\nYeah, I like to start at the beginning and\nthen take you all the way through.\n\n246\n00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:05.720\nNow once I have a picture and I'm moving\nit, what if it, it's a little big, right?\n\n247\n00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.480\nI want to make it a little smaller,\nso how do I resize it?\n\n248\n00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.600\nI think the easiest way,\n\n249\n00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.970\nwell, sometimes the easiest way\nis by the resizing handles.\n\n250\n00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:20.670\nNote, go from corner,\ndon't go from the top or the bottom.\n\n251\n00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:24.910\nThe reason why is if I go from the top\ncorner, doesn't matter which corner, and\n\n252\n00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:27.209\nif I click hold, I'm not holding any key.\n\n253\n00:14:27.209 --> 00:14:31.028\nBut do you notice how it is maintaining\nthe proportion, I'm gonna move this up so\n\n254\n00:14:31.028 --> 00:14:33.520\nyou can see a little bit,\nmay be zoom out too.\n\n255\n00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:37.870\nSo I can go from the bottom corner,\nsize this up, but\n\n256\n00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:39.720\nit keeps all of the proportions.\n\n257\n00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:44.210\nIf I go here, this is one of my\nbiggest pet peeves in finding\n\n258\n00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:50.560\na mis-proportionally sized images,\nI can spot it like nobody's business.\n\n259\n00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.700\nIt's just a big thing with me,\nsome people are like what's wrong that?\n\n260\n00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:59.410\nDon't you see it's stretched, so\nit's just something to don't get it.\n\n261\n00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:03.600\nNow, you could grab the side or the top,\nbut you need to hold your Shift key.\n\n262\n00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.660\nNo, you can't do it,\nyou know what, never mind,\n\n263\n00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:08.260\ndo the corner,\nmaybe my Shift key isn't working.\n\n264\n00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:09.710\nSome other programs you can,\n\n265\n00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:12.680\nbut you know what, just go from\nthe corner, let's just go ahead.\n\n266\n00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.270\n&gt;&gt; You know Vonne, this is something\nthat I'm not even sure why they give you\n\n267\n00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:19.240\nthe left and right,\nbecause no matter what image you have.\n\n268\n00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:22.630\n&gt;&gt; I can't think of a single time where\nI've tried to stretch it in one direction,\n\n269\n00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:24.620\nand it's worked out well for\nme because I'm like you.\n\n270\n00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:27.270\nI'm like, ew that's nasty, ew, ew,\n\n271\n00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:31.982\nwhat is, like the poor cat looks\nlike he's got a head this wide.\n\n272\n00:15:31.982 --> 00:15:32.600\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n[LAUGH]\n\n273\n00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.503\n&gt;&gt; For the most part,\n\n274\n00:15:33.503 --> 00:15:37.119\nthe only way to fix that, you're gonna\nhave to manipulate the image if you do\n\n275\n00:15:37.119 --> 00:15:40.359\nneed it to have, essentially,\na different aspect ratio, right?\n\n276\n00:15:40.359 --> 00:15:45.170\nSo if I need it to be long this way,\nmight have to cut some of this off, and\n\n277\n00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:48.043\nyeah, so\nI want you to be just careful there.\n\n278\n00:15:48.043 --> 00:15:51.973\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, I want to make it like you're\nsaying a little bit instead of this way,\n\n279\n00:15:51.973 --> 00:15:55.159\nI want it more this way Or\nthen if you'll go for cropping, okay.\n\n280\n00:15:55.159 --> 00:15:58.746\nSo there's different ways to achieve\nmaybe what you're looking for but\n\n281\n00:15:58.746 --> 00:16:00.880\nnot by stretching it, don't stretch it.\n\n282\n00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.630\nAnd we'll get into\nformatting our images too.\n\n283\n00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:06.203\nSo, that's the easiest way I\nthink to go ahead and resize it,\n\n284\n00:16:06.203 --> 00:16:08.770\ngrab a corner side it down,\nmove it around.\n\n285\n00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:12.480\nYou could also rotate it by that\nlittle button up top little antenna.\n\n286\n00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.430\nNotice if I click hold and drag I could go\nahead and turn it, either left or right.\n\n287\n00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:18.971\nBy the way, I'm doing undo.\n\n288\n00:16:18.971 --> 00:16:22.074\nI'm just doing command z throughout\nhere let's just go ahead like nope,\n\n289\n00:16:22.074 --> 00:16:23.990\nI don't want it stretch and\nso on and so fort.\n\n290\n00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:28.800\nSo, moving, resizing,\ninsert the image, that's great.\n\n291\n00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:33.860\nThe other thing that you can also do\nbesides going up to the contextual tab\n\n292\n00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.800\nto do some formats and\neverything like that.\n\n293\n00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:41.756\nIs you can bring up\nthe format picture task pane.\n\n294\n00:16:41.756 --> 00:16:44.740\nNow I have it selected and\nwhile have it selected\n\n295\n00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:49.440\non the ribbon all the way over here on the\nright, there is a button for format pane.\n\n296\n00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.780\nAnd it gets into the format picture.\n\n297\n00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:54.620\nA lot of the things that we're going to\nbe doing in the next episode where we're\n\n298\n00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:56.980\ngonna be changing the transparency and\nthe color.\n\n299\n00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.250\nTotally fine to do it from the ribbon.\n\n300\n00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:02.890\nYou could also do it from the task pane.\n\n301\n00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:06.000\nNotice there's a couple\ndifferent buttons up here for\n\n302\n00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.620\nthe fill and if I hover,\nwill it give me a little tool tip?\n\n303\n00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:15.740\nThere you go, see, fill in line, effects,\nsize and properties and picture.\n\n304\n00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:21.420\nSo it correlates, there's a few extra\nthings in here that can help you and\n\n305\n00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:24.900\nyou need to go to for\nthe format picture task pane.\n\n306\n00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:27.260\nThere's another way you can do it,\nI'm gonna close this.\n\n307\n00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:28.900\nInstead of having it selected and\n\n308\n00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:32.150\nclicking the button,\nyou can also right click on this.\n\n309\n00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:36.640\nIf you right click on the image, notice I\nright clicked and it also selected it, so\n\n310\n00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:37.880\nit's just kinda part of what it does.\n\n311\n00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:42.310\nThere is format picture,\nonce I get to format my picture,\n\n312\n00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:43.950\nit brings the task hang up, okay?\n\n313\n00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:47.070\nSo a couple of different ways\nto get to the same place for\n\n314\n00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:48.150\nyou to be able to size it.\n\n315\n00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:50.870\nActually, I need that back up, so\nlet me go ahead and put it up,\n\n316\n00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:55.470\nbecause one of the things that I like\nto do, you can do it right here.\n\n317\n00:17:55.470 --> 00:18:00.460\nBut in this button you go into\nthe size and notice there's\n\n318\n00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:03.920\nthings that you can do to go ahead and\nchange like the width and height.\n\n319\n00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:07.000\nYou can also change\nthe scale within height,\n\n320\n00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.800\nyou can also lock the aspect ratios.\n\n321\n00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:12.620\nA few more things behind my head, so you\ncan see that it's like well we're changing\n\n322\n00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:14.300\nit relative to the original picture size.\n\n323\n00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:15.960\nYou can also reset this, right?\n\n324\n00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:20.660\nIf I size this, and I wanna set it back,\nyou can click the reset button.\n\n325\n00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:23.560\nThere's also a nice reason of why\nyou can come into this format\n\n326\n00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:28.090\npicture task panes like,\nI want it to be 50% of its original size.\n\n327\n00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:28.700\nYou could go ahead and\n\n328\n00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.740\ntype the values in here instead\nof using the resizing handles.\n\n329\n00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:34.410\nCuz watch this,\nI'm gonna move Bishop over.\n\n330\n00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:37.557\nI'm gonna close this for right now,\nI'm making him little smaller and\n\n331\n00:18:37.557 --> 00:18:39.170\nmove him over here.\n\n332\n00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:40.520\nLet's put in another picture.\n\n333\n00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:43.499\nLet's go into insert, and\nwe'll go into pictures and\n\n334\n00:18:43.499 --> 00:18:45.520\nwe'll go to picture from file.\n\n335\n00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.970\nNo, you know what,\nwe're gonna hit the browser, right?\n\n336\n00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.530\nWe're gonna miss it up so\nyou can see what it looks like.\n\n337\n00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:55.750\nIt's going to bring up all of your\nphotos in your photos app right here.\n\n338\n00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:59.370\nIt has the same way that you can go ahead\nand organize things by like moments and\n\n339\n00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:00.470\ncollections.\n\n340\n00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:04.710\nI only have a couple right here,\nwe're gonna, you know what?\n\n341\n00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:06.970\nWhich picture of Fuego\nwould you like to pick?\n\n342\n00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:10.505\nDo you want the ones of him in the leaves\nor him sunning himself in the-\n\n343\n00:19:10.505 --> 00:19:11.106\n&gt;&gt; I've got to go with sunning,\n\n344\n00:19:11.106 --> 00:19:13.305\nthese are always the fun-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n345\n00:19:13.305 --> 00:19:14.718\n&gt;&gt; And it always looks like they're\n\n346\n00:19:14.718 --> 00:19:16.837\njudging you,\nlike bring me a matai or something,\n\n347\n00:19:16.837 --> 00:19:19.210\nthat's kinda what I feel\nlike the cat is telling me.\n\n348\n00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:22.412\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty,\nyou've got Fuego pegged for sure.\n\n349\n00:19:22.412 --> 00:19:26.130\nSo [LAUGH] I'm just gonna go ahead and\ndouble click on this.\n\n350\n00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:28.350\nAnd then, well, no,\nI'm not gonna double click on it.\n\n351\n00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:29.520\nI forgot, that's not how you do it.\n\n352\n00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.695\nYou just go ahead and drag and drop.\n\n353\n00:19:30.695 --> 00:19:32.030\n[LAUGH] My bad.\n\n354\n00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:33.950\nSo I can go ahead and put this in.\n\n355\n00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:36.688\nI'll close this and\nnow I've got my patient.\n\n356\n00:19:36.688 --> 00:19:40.330\nBut look, this is a big,\nI'm gonna zoom like really.\n\n357\n00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:44.064\nThis is what we talk about with that\nresolution and the file sizes and\n\n358\n00:19:44.064 --> 00:19:45.384\neverything like that.\n\n359\n00:19:45.384 --> 00:19:47.780\nThat's a really big picture, right?\n\n360\n00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:49.870\nAnd it might be harder for\nme to go ahead and\n\n361\n00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:52.598\nresize it from the handles, so guess what?\n\n362\n00:19:52.598 --> 00:19:55.920\nI'm gonna go that picture task pane and\ngo ahead and format it that way.\n\n363\n00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:01.230\nSo I'm gonna right click on the photo,\ngo to format picture,\n\n364\n00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:06.230\ncome over here to the little\nbutton that says the size, and\n\n365\n00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:09.718\nthen I want to scale this by like 50%.\n\n366\n00:20:09.718 --> 00:20:14.193\nI only want it to be like 25% of it's\noriginal size, so if I do 25 here,\n\n367\n00:20:14.193 --> 00:20:19.770\nnotice that I do have locked aspect ratio,\nso that way it doesn't squash it.\n\n368\n00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:24.110\nSo now it's a little bit\nmore manageable of a size.\n\n369\n00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:26.540\nAnd then I could go head and\nmake it even smaller.\n\n370\n00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:29.740\nAnd now I can use the resizing\nhandles to go head and\n\n371\n00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:33.266\nget it to the size that I want it to be.\n\n372\n00:20:33.266 --> 00:20:37.845\nSo it's kinda nice to go in there and\ntype in the values for sizing,\n\n373\n00:20:37.845 --> 00:20:42.175\nrather than just relying only\non the resizing handles.\n\n374\n00:20:42.175 --> 00:20:48.025\nSo, something to kinda to look for and\nbe aware of and where is, there you go.\n\n375\n00:20:48.025 --> 00:20:50.825\nNow, I got the two boys together.\n\n376\n00:20:50.825 --> 00:20:55.480\nAnd yes, we call him the great white\nbuffalo cuz he just kinda looks like\n\n377\n00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:59.980\nhe's just laying in his grass and\nhe's a big white buffalo.\n\n378\n00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.710\nAll right, so those are your images,\n\n379\n00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:07.220\nthose are the basic type of graphical\nelements that you can insert.\n\n380\n00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:10.570\nBut notice that you can\nalso put in shapes,\n\n381\n00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:13.460\nwe have a whole episode\nabout doing shapes.\n\n382\n00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:19.223\nBut another thing that's more of\na picture would be your screenshot.\n\n383\n00:21:19.223 --> 00:21:24.155\nOkay I love doing this, it's the same\nthing that I use in Word a lot,\n\n384\n00:21:24.155 --> 00:21:27.680\nmaybe not so much as in,\nwhat are we doing?\n\n385\n00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:28.250\nIs Excel,\n\n386\n00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:31.115\nI almost said illustrator [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That\n\n387\n00:21:31.115 --> 00:21:35.912\nwould be a weird Illustrator, I don't know\nhow much you would get down on there.\n\n388\n00:21:35.912 --> 00:21:41.413\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I'm like yeah okay, Okay, so yes,\nwhen I'm doing is screen clipping but\n\n389\n00:21:41.413 --> 00:21:47.098\nI wanted to give you a couple little\npointers on that because maybe I have\n\n390\n00:21:47.098 --> 00:21:53.446\nmy finder here and maybe we have Chrome\nopened and the calendar or what have you.\n\n391\n00:21:53.446 --> 00:21:56.890\nOkay, so I have these different apps.\n\n392\n00:21:56.890 --> 00:22:01.270\nWhen I come back over to Excel and I’m\nlooking to insert a screenshot notice that\n\n393\n00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:07.880\nit’s going to give me options for all of\nmy open applications or windows right now.\n\n394\n00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:12.000\nSo it’s like cool, cuz maybe I was trying\nto do a demonstration of something or\n\n395\n00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.670\nI needed to show a screen\nclipping of the finder.\n\n396\n00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:18.980\nWell it's already up, so\nall I gotta do is just click it.\n\n397\n00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:25.100\nAnd then it inserts this as a screenshot,\nso there you go, cool.\n\n398\n00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:28.668\nI'm gonna just scroll down a little\nbit more and just go and do it again.\n\n399\n00:22:28.668 --> 00:22:29.810\nLike okay, well maybe I want,\n\n400\n00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:32.460\noops, that's the wrong button how\nabout we go to the insert button.\n\n401\n00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:36.620\nFrom here I can put my calendar\nI think you get the idea here of\n\n402\n00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:38.850\nany open application.\n\n403\n00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:41.880\nBut the neat thing that I\nlike is the screen clipping,\n\n404\n00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:44.590\nokay now the screen clipping,\ncuz maybe I wanna come out here and\n\n405\n00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:47.240\nI only want this part right here, right?\n\n406\n00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.570\nI just wanna go ahead and\n\n407\n00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:52.150\nclip out this one little part\nabout on the Google home page.\n\n408\n00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:54.780\nSo there's a couple pointers,\n\n409\n00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:59.280\nnotice this is the last thing I have this\nup right now, this is my active window.\n\n410\n00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:02.031\nAnd then I switch back over to Excel.\n\n411\n00:23:02.031 --> 00:23:05.070\nI'm just gonna delete that by the way\njust so it doesn't confuse us.\n\n412\n00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:10.860\nWhen I go back to insert and go to screen\nclipping, notice it sucks down itself and\n\n413\n00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:15.760\nit brings up the last thing\nthat I was active on, okay.\n\n414\n00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.141\nMaybe it was, oops, the wrong one.\n\n415\n00:23:18.141 --> 00:23:21.441\nIf you ever wanna get out of your screen\nclipping, just hit the escape key on your\n\n416\n00:23:21.441 --> 00:23:24.720\nkeyboard, so you hit escape then\nit's like let's cancel this.\n\n417\n00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:29.630\nCuz watch, if I had like a finder app and\nthen my calendar,\n\n418\n00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:31.160\nand then the finder again.\n\n419\n00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.890\nAnd then I click back,\nclick back to Excel.\n\n420\n00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:37.160\nTry to take that screen clipping.\n\n421\n00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.960\nThis is the last thing\nthat I had active on.\n\n422\n00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:42.114\nBut it's like no I really\nwanted that the Google thing.\n\n423\n00:23:42.114 --> 00:23:46.519\nNo, that's the thing you gotta remember,\narrange or\n\n424\n00:23:46.519 --> 00:23:52.861\nbe on the thing that you want to clip out\nof Last before you come back into Excel.\n\n425\n00:23:52.861 --> 00:23:53.726\nDoes that make sense?\n\n426\n00:23:53.726 --> 00:23:56.315\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, essentially you're\nmanipulating the Z-index\n\n427\n00:23:56.315 --> 00:23:58.470\npositioning of respective windows, right?\n\n428\n00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:02.716\nSo the last thing you were there is now\nthe first thing under Excel when you click\n\n429\n00:24:02.716 --> 00:24:06.640\nback to Excel, because it essentially\nbrings the Windows to the front so\n\n430\n00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.269\nwhen it [NOISE], it's there.\n\n431\n00:24:08.269 --> 00:24:10.881\nSo it's just a manipulation,\nbut that's a good tip.\n\n432\n00:24:10.881 --> 00:24:13.519\nMake active what you want to clip.\n\n433\n00:24:13.519 --> 00:24:15.175\nThen go back to Excel.\n\n434\n00:24:15.175 --> 00:24:19.920\nAnd then you never have to go wait\na minute, which one's a stacked one?\n\n435\n00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:20.960\nJust click the one you want.\n\n436\n00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:21.780\nGo back to Excel.\n\n437\n00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:23.138\nScreen clipping, boom, it's there.\n\n438\n00:24:23.138 --> 00:24:27.010\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and z-index is a CSS thing,\nI know about that.\n\n439\n00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:32.530\nAnd it's actually a nice little\nforeshadowing into our arranging and\n\n440\n00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:35.560\nmanipulating images where we\ntalk about stacking order, okay?\n\n441\n00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:41.790\nSo got Chrome, get Excel, go ahead and\ninsert a screen clipping.\n\n442\n00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:43.090\nIt sucks everything down.\n\n443\n00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:47.370\nI get this little kind of,\nwhat is that little thing?\n\n444\n00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:49.271\nThis is almost like a scope,\nlike a target.\n\n445\n00:24:49.271 --> 00:24:51.256\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like a peep site or\nsomething, I don't know.\n\n446\n00:24:51.256 --> 00:24:54.123\nI'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it, right?\n\n447\n00:24:54.123 --> 00:24:57.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And then I just click,\nhold, and drag, and then I let go.\n\n448\n00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:02.055\nAnd then it clips that little\nguy right where I want it to be.\n\n449\n00:25:02.055 --> 00:25:04.630\nAnd that's pretty cool, love screenshots.\n\n450\n00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:06.050\nIt's pretty cool.\n\n451\n00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:10.140\nSo those are gonna be the major things,\nI guess you could say,\n\n452\n00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:13.780\nthe graphical elements that you're\ngoing to have as a picture format.\n\n453\n00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:17.850\nThe other ones with the shapes, well,\nthey're shapes, they're still graphics.\n\n454\n00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:22.820\nAnd then smart art, smart art is just\na really cool graphical representation\n\n455\n00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:25.690\nof your data that is\nrepresented in shapes and\n\n456\n00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:27.200\neverything that you pick from a library.\n\n457\n00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:30.940\nSo the things that we're going to\nbe doing throughout this entire\n\n458\n00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:33.320\ntopic all kind of come back into here.\n\n459\n00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:37.520\nYou have images,\nyou have some type of graphical pieces.\n\n460\n00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.440\nYou're going to format them.\n\n461\n00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:42.530\nYou need to know how to select them and\nmove them.\n\n462\n00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:46.440\nYou can go to the format picture or\nformat shape task pane,\n\n463\n00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:50.020\nto be able to get more options.\n\n464\n00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:54.560\nAnd so that is everything that\nI want to cover in the basics,\n\n465\n00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.150\nget us started, get our feet wet.\n\n466\n00:25:56.150 --> 00:26:00.960\nAnd then we'll move on through our\nother topics in this, well, topic.\n\n467\n00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.251\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, there you go.\n\n468\n00:26:02.251 --> 00:26:08.300\nTopics and topics, and\nsometimes words are kinda hard, right?\n\n469\n00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.560\nBut definitely stay tuned.\n\n470\n00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.700\nGraphics inside of Excel\nmay have seemed weird,\n\n471\n00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:17.210\nalmost unclean when we first started but\nthere are important applications and\n\n472\n00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:20.458\nit's something that you will probably\neventually do at some point.\n\n473\n00:26:20.458 --> 00:26:23.120\nSo definitely come on back, but for now\nwe're gonna go ahead and get out of here.\n\n474\n00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:26.110\nSo signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n475\n00:26:26.110 -->

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.562 --> 00:00:19.955\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison, and we're\ncoming back at you with more Excel 2016\n\n4\n00:00:19.955 --> 00:00:22.638\nAdvanced for\nMac We're doing a little more with images.\n\n5\n00:00:22.638 --> 00:00:24.789\nWe're gonna be looking\nat formatting images.\n\n6\n00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.508\nWell, that's what I've been told.\n\n7\n00:00:26.508 --> 00:00:29.300\nBut luckily we have someone on staff,\nin this room right now,\n\n8\n00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.181\nthat knows what exactly we're gonna do.\n\n9\n00:00:31.181 --> 00:00:32.578\nAnd that's Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n10\n00:00:32.578 --> 00:00:33.866\nHow do you do today, Vonne?\n\n11\n00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:34.941\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic.\n\n12\n00:00:34.941 --> 00:00:36.200\nAnd you are correct.\n\n13\n00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.590\nWe are going to be\nformatting images today.\n\n14\n00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.350\n&gt;&gt; Boy.\nI lucked out on that one.\n\n15\n00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.481\nNo, I jest, I jest.\n\n16\n00:00:41.481 --> 00:00:45.831\nSo formatting,\nformatting's kind of this blanket term.\n\n17\n00:00:45.831 --> 00:00:49.141\nCould you just give us a quick rundown,\nlike when you say formatting and I say\n\n18\n00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:53.091\nformatting, sometimes that gets a little\nambiguous, right, based on our background.\n\n19\n00:00:53.091 --> 00:00:55.224\nSo let's just make sure we're\nall on the same page here.\n\n20\n00:00:55.224 --> 00:00:57.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwe're gonna gussie it up a little bit.\n\n21\n00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.778\nWe're gonna make it look different.\n\n22\n00:00:59.778 --> 00:01:03.661\nJust like if we format text, we make\na different font size, different font,\n\n23\n00:01:03.661 --> 00:01:06.076\ndifferent color,\nsame thing with our images.\n\n24\n00:01:06.076 --> 00:01:10.039\nWe're going to crop them,\nwe're going to do some color adjustments,\n\n25\n00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:12.296\nwe're going to remove the background.\n\n26\n00:01:12.296 --> 00:01:16.603\nWe're gonna do some really cool things\nthat you can do within really all of\n\n27\n00:01:16.603 --> 00:01:19.876\nthe Office products within,\nwell, the Office suite.\n\n28\n00:01:19.876 --> 00:01:23.433\n[LAUGH] And it has all the same\ntype of image manipulation, so\n\n29\n00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:26.364\nwe're gonna go through\npretty much all of them.\n\n30\n00:01:26.364 --> 00:01:29.798\nSo you have a whole plethora\nof things you can do.\n\n31\n00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:34.214\nThis is something that I've always really\nliked that Microsoft has done throughout\n\n32\n00:01:34.214 --> 00:01:37.880\nthe years is really advance how you\ncan manipulate your images to where\n\n33\n00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.370\nthere are some things in here that are\nvery similar to what you do in Photoshop.\n\n34\n00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.520\nSo, pretty cool stuff here.\n\n35\n00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.140\nWhy don't we go ahead and get started?\n\n36\n00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.690\nI have the file actually the same one that\nI was working with in the last episode,\n\n37\n00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.940\nwe were just getting our feet wet and\ngetting our basics done.\n\n38\n00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.380\nWe did our screenshots, we brought in some\npictures from file and from the photo app.\n\n39\n00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.300\nI didn't really mention that, hey,\nif I didn't want this anymore,\n\n40\n00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.820\nI don't want it to be there,\nI wanna get rid of it, just delete it.\n\n41\n00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.125\nSo just select it, hit the delete key,\nthen it's gone, so that's good.\n\n42\n00:02:10.125 --> 00:02:13.430\nAnd I really don't need Google.\n\n43\n00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.956\nWe're good.\n\n44\n00:02:14.956 --> 00:02:16.161\nGoogle is a good thing.\n\n45\n00:02:16.161 --> 00:02:21.320\nAny search engine is fine, so\nthat's the one I particularly prefer.\n\n46\n00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.210\nGot some pictures.\n\n47\n00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.746\nSo let's start about the crop.\n\n48\n00:02:23.746 --> 00:02:27.100\nWe had kinda mentioned this\nin the last episode, like for\n\n49\n00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.120\nexample, I want to make this\npicture of Fuego not so\n\n50\n00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.280\nmuch long like more,\nwhat do we call this up, a portrait?\n\n51\n00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.510\nI wanna make it more square.\n\n52\n00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.510\nOkay, I don't really need\nall of this extra foliage\n\n53\n00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.570\nin this particular photograph,\nI wanna cut it out.\n\n54\n00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.134\nYou don't get the two pointed arrow here,\nwell, let's move this down a little bit.\n\n55\n00:02:49.134 --> 00:02:52.255\nYou don't get that,\nyou don't squash poor Mr. Fuego.\n\n56\n00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:53.453\nYou wanna crop it.\n\n57\n00:02:53.453 --> 00:02:55.130\nYou just wanna cut parts of it out.\n\n58\n00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.770\nWhere's the crop?\n\n59\n00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.110\nIt is on the Picture Format toolbar.\n\n60\n00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.000\nSo I have this image selected.\n\n61\n00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.720\nI go to the Picture Format,\nand we go to Crop.\n\n62\n00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.851\nAnd when I click this,\nnotice there is a dropdown,\n\n63\n00:03:07.851 --> 00:03:10.542\nwhich we'll get to what these\nthings actually mean in a second.\n\n64\n00:03:10.542 --> 00:03:11.652\nI just click the crop.\n\n65\n00:03:11.652 --> 00:03:17.678\nAnd then it puts on these black\nthings Things around the corners.\n\n66\n00:03:17.678 --> 00:03:20.848\nI call them the little pushers,\nin a sense.\n\n67\n00:03:20.848 --> 00:03:22.820\nIt's almost like a broom.\n\n68\n00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:28.220\nYou see and this is where you got to be\nvery careful about your mouse cursor.\n\n69\n00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.162\nI wonder if can zoom in enough\nto where you can see that.\n\n70\n00:03:32.162 --> 00:03:33.447\nNot that, this.\n\n71\n00:03:33.447 --> 00:03:36.730\n[LAUGH] This, that, that and this.\n\n72\n00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.770\nThis is the icon that you wanna have\nwhen you want to crop the image.\n\n73\n00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.970\nCuz the other way is you're resizing it.\n\n74\n00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.980\nSo it's kinda hard to find them.\n\n75\n00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:54.190\nBut notice that I'm pushing down\nthe boundary of what I want to see.\n\n76\n00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.260\nAnd you can totally come\nin from the corner.\n\n77\n00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.550\nIt doesn't matter which side.\n\n78\n00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.830\nBut as long as you get that particular\nicon on the corners or the tops and\n\n79\n00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.370\nthe bottoms, that's where you can\ngo ahead and use that to crop.\n\n80\n00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.061\nMaybe I'll pull this up\na little bit more this way.\n\n81\n00:04:08.061 --> 00:04:09.542\nAnd so there you go.\n\n82\n00:04:09.542 --> 00:04:12.503\nDo notice that this is all\nkinda grayed out up on the top,\n\n83\n00:04:12.503 --> 00:04:15.810\nthe part of the image that\nI don't need anymore?\n\n84\n00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:16.686\nAnd that's fine.\n\n85\n00:04:16.686 --> 00:04:19.420\nThe thing about crop it's like,\nokay, well, now I'm done.\n\n86\n00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.916\nWhat do you do?\n\n87\n00:04:20.916 --> 00:04:22.201\nYou just click off of it, okay?\n\n88\n00:04:22.201 --> 00:04:25.291\nOnce you click off it,\nit actually performs that crop, okay?\n\n89\n00:04:25.291 --> 00:04:29.194\nSo there's no magic button of like,\nyep, this is what you're done.\n\n90\n00:04:29.194 --> 00:04:31.772\nThere you go, and that's your crop, okay?\n\n91\n00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:34.612\nIt just took out parts that\nyou don't need to see.\n\n92\n00:04:34.612 --> 00:04:38.642\n&gt;&gt; All right, so sometimes cropping can\nget a little iffy cuz then later on,\n\n93\n00:04:38.642 --> 00:04:40.854\nI might be getting ahead of myself here.\n\n94\n00:04:40.854 --> 00:04:43.014\nMaybe you're already gonna\nbe talking about this but\n\n95\n00:04:43.014 --> 00:04:45.419\nit's been nagging at me cuz\nI've been burned by this.\n\n96\n00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:46.174\nI cropped it.\n\n97\n00:04:46.174 --> 00:04:46.705\nYou know what?\n\n98\n00:04:46.705 --> 00:04:49.261\nI actually do want that foliage.\n\n99\n00:04:49.261 --> 00:04:52.378\nIs all of that image information\nstill hidden in the background, and\n\n100\n00:04:52.378 --> 00:04:54.808\nyou're just essentially\ntaking down the viewport?\n\n101\n00:04:54.808 --> 00:04:59.550\nOr is it doing an actual like,\ncut this off, it's gone forever?\n\n102\n00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:00.370\n&gt;&gt; It's the other one.\n\n103\n00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.300\nYou're only changing the viewport, or\n\n104\n00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.060\nwhat I would call the mask,\nI'm masking this particular photograph.\n\n105\n00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.860\nSo that's the nice thing about it,\nis that it does not delete\n\n106\n00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.260\nthe picture information that\nyou're cropping, it's just hiding.\n\n107\n00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.599\nSo, for example,\nif I come back over here to Mr.\n\n108\n00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:20.740\nFuego Pants, and I go back to Crop,\nnotice that all that gray is still there.\n\n109\n00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.118\nSo I can come back in and maybe do this.\n\n110\n00:05:23.118 --> 00:05:24.731\nMaybe I can adjust the picture.\n\n111\n00:05:24.731 --> 00:05:27.046\nSee, I wanna maybe pull this\nup just a little bit more.\n\n112\n00:05:27.046 --> 00:05:32.022\nSo you can change, or move the picture\nwithin the crop, or the viewport,\n\n113\n00:05:32.022 --> 00:05:35.740\nor the mast,\nwhichever way we want to go with it.\n\n114\n00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.910\nAnd so there you go.\n\n115\n00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.290\nThat's the nice thing,\nis that it's not permanently gone.\n\n116\n00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:44.610\nSo pretty cool, good question, and\nthat is something to know about.\n\n117\n00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.360\nYou can also do some\nother types of cropping,\n\n118\n00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.990\nbecause you saw from that dropdown,\nwe have Crop to Shape,\n\n119\n00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.470\nwe also have Aspect Ratio,\nand we have Fill, and Fit.\n\n120\n00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:55.005\nWhat do those mean?\n\n121\n00:05:55.005 --> 00:05:59.831\nWell, aspect ratio's like,\nthere are particular dimensions,\n\n122\n00:05:59.831 --> 00:06:04.929\nlike three by four, which is a very\ncommon photo size, three by five.\n\n123\n00:06:04.929 --> 00:06:09.930\n16 by 9, those are more of\nyour widescreen type of ones.\n\n124\n00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.200\nIf I click on four by five,\n\n125\n00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:17.070\nall it does is it's taking the crop box,\nand I'll choose some other ones.\n\n126\n00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.510\nIt's gonna go ahead and, this one.\n\n127\n00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.250\nMaybe I'll do the 16.9,\nthat's the one that's behind my head,\n\n128\n00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.468\njust in case you can't see it.\n\n129\n00:06:23.468 --> 00:06:26.519\nSo if I click there,\nsee it's just changing the box.\n\n130\n00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:30.985\nIt's not making it 16 inches or\npixels or what have you.\n\n131\n00:06:30.985 --> 00:06:36.376\nIt's just this is the ratio of the width\nand height that I'm going to use.\n\n132\n00:06:36.376 --> 00:06:40.580\nAnd then I could take this and notice\nif I size it, I can still go ahead and\n\n133\n00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.293\nchange it.\n\n134\n00:06:41.293 --> 00:06:44.614\nSo that's not in a 16 by 9 aspect ratio.\n\n135\n00:06:44.614 --> 00:06:46.560\nThat's something that it is very freeform.\n\n136\n00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.890\nBut what if I wanted to\nkeep this aspect ratio?\n\n137\n00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:55.400\nDo you see how now it's not allowing\nme to change, like make it higher and\n\n138\n00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.490\nmake it longer?\n\n139\n00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:57.690\nWhat am I doing?\n\n140\n00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:59.570\nI'm holding the Shift key down.\n\n141\n00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.421\nSo if I'm holding the Shift key down,\nthat's what in pretty much all graphic\n\n142\n00:07:03.421 --> 00:07:06.160\nproducts or anything,\nit's maintain proportions.\n\n143\n00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.726\nSo I grab the corner, held the Shift key.\n\n144\n00:07:08.726 --> 00:07:12.668\nAnd that's where I can go ahead and\nmaintain that aspect ratio.\n\n145\n00:07:12.668 --> 00:07:18.465\nCuz I want Bishop to be that big and\nthen I click off, and then there you go.\n\n146\n00:07:18.465 --> 00:07:19.845\nI've cropped this image.\n\n147\n00:07:19.845 --> 00:07:25.145\nSo that's what that means with\nthe different options here.\n\n148\n00:07:25.145 --> 00:07:29.200\nIt's just a aspect ratio, that's it.\n\n149\n00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.510\nThe one that I like of\ncourse is crop to shape.\n\n150\n00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.570\nOkay, maybe I wanna put Fuego\non a cute little heart frame,\n\n151\n00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.750\nand then look, awe, isn't he adorable?\n\n152\n00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:43.139\nAnd so there you go, I went ahead and\ncropped them to a shape.\n\n153\n00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:45.150\nI could do the same thing with Bishop.\n\n154\n00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:49.810\nI could go ahead and\ncrop him into a heart, and that's cute.\n\n155\n00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:52.720\nNow some other things that you\nhave with these crops, and\n\n156\n00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.900\nespecially with the shapes,\nis you have fill and fit.\n\n157\n00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:56.627\nLet's see what they do.\n\n158\n00:07:56.627 --> 00:07:59.871\nIf I click Fill,\nnotice that it's gonna go ahead and\n\n159\n00:07:59.871 --> 00:08:03.579\ntry to fill the picture into\nthat shape as much as possible.\n\n160\n00:08:03.579 --> 00:08:06.909\nBecause of the shape and\nlike the size of the picture,\n\n161\n00:08:06.909 --> 00:08:10.150\nit's gonna be kinda hard to do that.\n\n162\n00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:13.870\nBesides like, all right, I can move\nit up and down, but if I do fit.\n\n163\n00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:16.530\nOkay, see it's trying to fit\nthe picture into the shape.\n\n164\n00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:19.870\nLike the whole picture and that,\nthat doesn't make any sense for\n\n165\n00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.460\nthis particular option, okay?\n\n166\n00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.820\nBut that's the difference and\n\n167\n00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:28.460\nreally it's just pick one, it looks good,\nyou don't like it, pick the other.\n\n168\n00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.110\nIf that doesn't look good\ndon't pick either of them.\n\n169\n00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.420\nAnd those are your options.\n\n170\n00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:32.310\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne, that's pretty slick.\n\n171\n00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:33.770\nI don't like that tiny little image,\n\n172\n00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:35.410\nbecause it doesn't make\nsense in this context.\n\n173\n00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:39.750\nBut I'm looking at these and\nthe heart cropping, pretty nice.\n\n174\n00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:43.360\nYou said we were gonna gussy these up and\nI don't think we need some more.\n\n175\n00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:47.440\nIs there other things that we can kinda\nmaybe add a border or some effects or\n\n176\n00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.090\nsomething like that?\n\n177\n00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:49.490\n&gt;&gt; We sure can.\n\n178\n00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:53.778\nWe're gonna make Mr. Fuego look amazing or\nat least this picture.\n\n179\n00:08:53.778 --> 00:08:56.527\nSo yes, sorry,\nI hit the mouse a little too far.\n\n180\n00:08:56.527 --> 00:09:02.018\nSo I wanna add a border, so let's go\nthrough a bunch of these different things.\n\n181\n00:09:02.018 --> 00:09:04.378\nAnd this is where I'm gonna just\nshow you one or two of them and\n\n182\n00:09:04.378 --> 00:09:06.288\nthen you can go ahead and\npick some of the others.\n\n183\n00:09:06.288 --> 00:09:08.598\nRight here, there is a border.\n\n184\n00:09:08.598 --> 00:09:09.783\nLooks like a little pencil.\n\n185\n00:09:09.783 --> 00:09:12.258\nWe have effects and we have styles.\n\n186\n00:09:12.258 --> 00:09:14.041\nAlso my resolution is lower, so\n\n187\n00:09:14.041 --> 00:09:18.343\nthat's why you might see them a little\nbit differently in your environment.\n\n188\n00:09:18.343 --> 00:09:21.717\nSo when you have your border,\nthat's just around the edge.\n\n189\n00:09:21.717 --> 00:09:24.740\nAnd it is around wherever it's cropped to.\n\n190\n00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:28.020\nSo if I pick, let's say, purple,\nlike there's a purple border,\n\n191\n00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.820\nbut you can't really see it very well,\ncan you?\n\n192\n00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:35.620\nNo, that's because you need to have\na thicker weight of this border.\n\n193\n00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.110\nSo if I pick, let's say, six pixels.\n\n194\n00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:40.370\nOkay, now we can see it\na little bit better.\n\n195\n00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:44.780\nMaybe I'll choose a green, so\nthat looks a little nice and\n\n196\n00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.221\nmatches the foliage around it.\n\n197\n00:09:47.221 --> 00:09:50.614\nSo that's where you can pick\nany of your border colors.\n\n198\n00:09:50.614 --> 00:09:55.230\nYou can go to more colors and\nfind pinks and purples and what have you.\n\n199\n00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:57.700\nSo that's the border.\n\n200\n00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:01.377\nThe other thing you can do with your\npictures is you can add effects.\n\n201\n00:10:01.377 --> 00:10:02.898\nNow look at all these effects.\n\n202\n00:10:02.898 --> 00:10:06.196\nI am not gonna go through every single one\nof them, because there's a lot of them.\n\n203\n00:10:06.196 --> 00:10:10.816\nBut you can put on a drop shadow,\nyou can put on a reflection,\n\n204\n00:10:10.816 --> 00:10:15.900\na glow, maybe we want Fuego to have\na nice orange glow around him.\n\n205\n00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.610\nHe is a flame point.\n\n206\n00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:19.680\nSo there you go, pretty cute.\n\n207\n00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.760\nIf you wanted to change the glow color,\n\n208\n00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:27.580\nyou could down there in the glow\ncolors and the glow options.\n\n209\n00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.270\nYou can make them bigger.\n\n210\n00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:32.600\nAll of these are basically,\nlike your presets.\n\n211\n00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.220\nSo I could go into some bevel.\n\n212\n00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.510\nMaybe I wanna do a little bevel in there.\n\n213\n00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:40.230\nI could do some three D rotations,\nisn't that cute?\n\n214\n00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:41.410\nOkay, now that's a little too much.\n\n215\n00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:43.810\nI'm gonna just do one undo on that one.\n\n216\n00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:50.120\nSo you could go through and change all of\nthese different effects on your images.\n\n217\n00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.330\nAnd what a quick style is,\n\n218\n00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:56.730\na style we know all about styles in\nall sorts of different places, right?\n\n219\n00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.770\nStyle is just a named group formatting.\n\n220\n00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:02.830\nOkay, so I wanna go ahead and\nhave a drop shadow.\n\n221\n00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:07.210\nI wanna have at like the corners,\nI want it laying down.\n\n222\n00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:09.780\nSo all those things that\nwe just did individually,\n\n223\n00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:13.510\nall in one group if you wanna say.\n\n224\n00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:18.260\nSo I usually like,\nthat's one of my favorites, okay.\n\n225\n00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.160\nI like that, but mainly,\nthe border isn't fancy enough.\n\n226\n00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.860\nSo then I'll come in here.\n\n227\n00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:27.170\nMaybe add a pink border and\nthen there you go.\n\n228\n00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:29.924\nCool, so you can start with the style,\nand then go through in and\n\n229\n00:11:29.924 --> 00:11:31.200\nadd your different effects.\n\n230\n00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:35.416\nIf I click off of it, this is my\ngo to style in pretty much every\n\n231\n00:11:35.416 --> 00:11:38.991\ndemonstration that I do,\nand that's pretty fun.\n\n232\n00:11:38.991 --> 00:11:43.158\nAll right, cool, so\nwe have borders, we have styles.\n\n233\n00:11:43.158 --> 00:11:49.554\nLet's go on to a few more and I'm gonna\ncome over here to the picture format.\n\n234\n00:11:49.554 --> 00:11:52.789\nI don't really wanna\ncrop the shape anymore.\n\n235\n00:11:52.789 --> 00:11:56.210\nWell this is actually a good\npoint to start right here.\n\n236\n00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:59.980\nIt's just like,\nI just kinda wanna start over, okay?\n\n237\n00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:04.100\nI like Bishop's picture, but\nI wanna get it back to where I just had,\n\n238\n00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:08.730\nlike the rectangle picture\nnone of the hearts around it.\n\n239\n00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:10.800\nSo how do I reset this?\n\n240\n00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.773\nThere is a button right\nhere called reset picture.\n\n241\n00:12:13.773 --> 00:12:17.742\nNow there are two options here\nthere's a reset picture and\n\n242\n00:12:17.742 --> 00:12:20.010\nthere is a reset picture in size.\n\n243\n00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:23.764\nSo if i choose the first one,\nnotice how it doesn't get all big again,\n\n244\n00:12:23.764 --> 00:12:27.456\nit just went ahead and said all right,\nwell this is how you sized it and\n\n245\n00:12:27.456 --> 00:12:30.150\ncropped it, so\nI'm going to go ahead and do that.\n\n246\n00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:34.150\nBut if I reset the whole thing it's like,\nokay, now I'm going back.\n\n247\n00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:35.850\nBut that's not how big it was.\n\n248\n00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:39.510\nYeah, but I can go ahead and\nmake it bigger here and be fine.\n\n249\n00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:45.110\nSo it's like, just take off the effects or\ngo back to the original size that I had.\n\n250\n00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:48.320\nIf I did this with Fuego, it would go all\nthe way back to the really big picture.\n\n251\n00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:53.871\nSo it's nice to have that,\nlet's start over button.\n\n252\n00:12:53.871 --> 00:12:58.242\nSo once I have Bishop Timothy here\nselected, I can go over to some of these\n\n253\n00:12:58.242 --> 00:13:02.697\nother buttons and this is where it\ngets very much like Photoshop, right?\n\n254\n00:13:02.697 --> 00:13:07.020\nWhere you can do a lot of image\nmanipulations with all of these precepts.\n\n255\n00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.360\n&gt;&gt; I'm definitely interested to see that,\n\n256\n00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.052\nbecause I remember back in some old\nschool things where you're like,\n\n257\n00:13:13.052 --> 00:13:17.840\nall right let me open up Microsoft paint\nor something like that to add ahh.\n\n258\n00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.330\nAnyway, before I get to there.\n\n259\n00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:24.560\nThat undo, if I save this workbook,\nclose it out, do I still have the ability\n\n260\n00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:28.530\nto do all those undos, because I know\nthere's times where that gets cut off.\n\n261\n00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:33.040\nSo if I have tiny little pictures\ncan I do and undo if I close it out?\n\n262\n00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:34.680\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n263\n00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.700\nSo just to show you.\n\n264\n00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:39.590\nLet's go ahead and I'm just saving\nthis as a test on my desktop and\n\n265\n00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:41.530\nI will go ahead and close Excel.\n\n266\n00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:43.280\nI just did a command Q for that.\n\n267\n00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:47.666\nI'll go ahead, I don't need a Haroopad\nthat's for my notes and everything.\n\n268\n00:13:47.666 --> 00:13:50.833\nYeah, I forgot I had all these stuff open\nfrom when we did our screenshots, right?\n\n269\n00:13:50.833 --> 00:13:54.904\nSo then when I open this back up and\nwe go ahead here,\n\n270\n00:13:54.904 --> 00:13:58.180\nright here with Fuego, remember?\n\n271\n00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:01.913\nIf we go ahead and take this and\nthen we reset the picture in size,\n\n272\n00:14:01.913 --> 00:14:03.582\nyep it goes all the way back.\n\n273\n00:14:03.582 --> 00:14:07.743\nSo it remembers all that information,\nbut as soon as you said that,\n\n274\n00:14:07.743 --> 00:14:11.036\nthere's actually,\nI'm glad you pointed this out.\n\n275\n00:14:11.036 --> 00:14:17.500\nBecause there could be a reason,\nwhy this wouldn't work, okay?\n\n276\n00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:21.630\nThere's something known as\ncompressing an image, okay?\n\n277\n00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:25.790\nWhen I compress an image, and\nlet's just do this really quickly.\n\n278\n00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:27.770\nI'm gonna scroll down here.\n\n279\n00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:32.150\nWe'll insert, cuz I think this\nwill be a good demonstration.\n\n280\n00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.400\nLet's grab this one,\nit's not that a click, you gotta drag and\n\n281\n00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.150\ndrop, [LAUGH] I keep forgetting that.\n\n282\n00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:40.200\nOkay, so this is a really big picture,\n\n283\n00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:44.210\nwe'll come over here,\nwe'll get 45 inches, okay.\n\n284\n00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:45.790\nLet's just do two [LAUGH].\n\n285\n00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:50.630\nSo this is how big Fuego goes,\nremember it was really, really big, right?\n\n286\n00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:53.070\nBut I made him two inches.\n\n287\n00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:56.600\nWell, all that information,\nwe've kinda demonstrated it.\n\n288\n00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.680\nIt stays with it, right?\n\n289\n00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:03.150\nWell the thing is, I don't need\nthe picture to be 45 inches by 25 inches.\n\n290\n00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:04.350\nI only need it to be this.\n\n291\n00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:05.180\nThat's all I need.\n\n292\n00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:10.190\nI don't need any extra\ninformation than this.\n\n293\n00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:15.496\nThis button right here, this is the\nCompress Pictures also known optimizing,\n\n294\n00:15:15.496 --> 00:15:18.901\nwhen you optimize graphics or\noptimize a web page,\n\n295\n00:15:18.901 --> 00:15:23.112\nyou wanna load it faster,\nthis is one of those types of things.\n\n296\n00:15:23.112 --> 00:15:29.549\nWhen I click on this image, what I can do\nis I'm removing all the extra information.\n\n297\n00:15:29.549 --> 00:15:33.713\nAnd so this is one of those things where\nI wouldn't wanna do the high fidelity,\n\n298\n00:15:33.713 --> 00:15:35.743\ncuz I'm trying get my files smaller.\n\n299\n00:15:35.743 --> 00:15:39.062\nSo I would just say,\nprobably on screen 150.\n\n300\n00:15:39.062 --> 00:15:40.560\nThe other thing is right here.\n\n301\n00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:44.480\nDelete all the cropped information, and\n\n302\n00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:48.610\nwould it be all the pictures in this\nfile or just the selected image?\n\n303\n00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:51.760\nSo if somebody went ahead and optimized or\ncompressed all their graphics,\n\n304\n00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.910\nand you went ahead and like, I saved it,\nand come back, and it was like,\n\n305\n00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:56.212\nwhy isn't it getting bigger?\n\n306\n00:15:56.212 --> 00:15:59.730\nBecause they actually removed\nall of that extra information.\n\n307\n00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:01.843\nSo this can happen, and\nthis is a good thing.\n\n308\n00:16:01.843 --> 00:16:04.109\nI'm not saying it's a bad thing,\n\n309\n00:16:04.109 --> 00:16:09.267\nbecause If I have 16 images in this\nparticular file, I don't want it to get so\n\n310\n00:16:09.267 --> 00:16:14.210\nbig cuz I'm using massively high\nresolution or pixel information files.\n\n311\n00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:15.650\nI just need them to be this big.\n\n312\n00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:17.349\nWe just get rid of all\nthe extra information.\n\n313\n00:16:17.349 --> 00:16:21.880\nSo compressing pictures is a good thing to\ndo when you want to optimize your files.\n\n314\n00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:27.940\nSo that's the reason why it might not\nwork for you, but excellent question.\n\n315\n00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.078\nAnd there we go, perfect.\n\n316\n00:16:30.078 --> 00:16:37.498\nSo back over here to gussying it up and\ngetting into our Photoshoppy type things.\n\n317\n00:16:37.498 --> 00:16:40.850\nYou have your color,\nyou have your artistic effects.\n\n318\n00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:44.593\nThese are straight out\nof Photoshop filters.\n\n319\n00:16:44.593 --> 00:16:48.487\nIt's pretty cool, like this one right\nhere, this is like the glowing edges,\n\n320\n00:16:48.487 --> 00:16:51.803\njust right from that particular file or\nthat particular program.\n\n321\n00:16:51.803 --> 00:16:55.754\nAnd then we have some corrections where\nyou can change like the brightness and\n\n322\n00:16:55.754 --> 00:16:58.323\nthe sharpness and\nall of these wonderful things.\n\n323\n00:16:58.323 --> 00:17:02.936\nSo all of the stuff if I wanted to\nmake it more like a blue cast or\n\n324\n00:17:02.936 --> 00:17:08.378\na blue tinted photograph, and\nthen I want to put on some glowing edges.\n\n325\n00:17:08.378 --> 00:17:10.177\nOoh, gosh,\nhe's looking kind of scary, isn't he?\n\n326\n00:17:10.177 --> 00:17:15.720\n[LAUGH] And then I wanna make\nit a little bit brighter, okay.\n\n327\n00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:19.807\nThis is time where we're gonna hit the\nReset button [LAUGH] cuz Bishop's looking\n\n328\n00:17:19.807 --> 00:17:20.890\nkind of scary.\n\n329\n00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:22.498\nSo if I reset that, and\n\n330\n00:17:22.498 --> 00:17:27.002\nnotice that takes all of those\neffects that I am applying to it.\n\n331\n00:17:27.002 --> 00:17:30.116\nSo again, I'm not gonna go through\nevery single one of them in detail.\n\n332\n00:17:30.116 --> 00:17:33.962\nThe transparency, maybe I wanna make\nit a little bit more transparent.\n\n333\n00:17:33.962 --> 00:17:38.727\nBut every single one of these,\nnotice there's a thing down at\n\n334\n00:17:38.727 --> 00:17:43.783\nthe bottom that says, hey,\ndo you want to bring up more options?\n\n335\n00:17:43.783 --> 00:17:46.303\nAnd it's just going to, when I click it,\n\n336\n00:17:46.303 --> 00:17:49.048\nit brings up the picture\ntask pane over here.\n\n337\n00:17:49.048 --> 00:17:53.074\nBecause I could go through and\nmanipulate the sharpness and\n\n338\n00:17:53.074 --> 00:17:58.065\nthe brightness, or if I, down behind\nmy head, I have the picture color,\n\n339\n00:17:58.065 --> 00:18:01.770\nI could change the saturation,\nthe transparency.\n\n340\n00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:06.440\nAll of this you could do\nthrough the sliders in here and\n\n341\n00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.650\ngive you way more information.\n\n342\n00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:11.460\nHonestly, to me,\nI think these little buttons, and\n\n343\n00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.400\nit's nice cuz it shows you, right?\n\n344\n00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:17.520\nIt gives you a little preview of\nwhat this particular function or\n\n345\n00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.020\ncorrection is gonna do.\n\n346\n00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:22.360\nSo I just stick to what's in\nthe drop-downs from the ribbon.\n\n347\n00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:27.496\nBut do know you have more\ntweaking ability in the task pane\n\n348\n00:18:27.496 --> 00:18:32.531\nif you wanna do more image\nmanipulation through there.\n\n349\n00:18:32.531 --> 00:18:34.370\nAnd so you can do some neat things.\n\n350\n00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:37.370\nAnd, of course, it's like, is it\naffecting the white versus the black?\n\n351\n00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:40.920\nThere is this thing where it says,\nset the transparent color.\n\n352\n00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.090\nAnd you're like, okay?\n\n353\n00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:46.947\nSo I want all of the black to be,\nwell, that didn't work at all, did it?\n\n354\n00:18:46.947 --> 00:18:48.190\nOkay, let's try that again.\n\n355\n00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:52.280\nLet's go with this Set Transparent Color\nand I click, why is this not?\n\n356\n00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.430\nOkay, let's try this again, all right.\n\n357\n00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:58.294\nLet's come over here,\nlet's reset the picture just for\n\n358\n00:18:58.294 --> 00:19:01.230\nfun just in case anything happened.\n\n359\n00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:04.572\nAnd now I'm gonna go over this one.\n\n360\n00:19:04.572 --> 00:19:06.750\n[LAUGH] Goodness, gracious.\n\n361\n00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:11.920\nSo if I set the transparent color,\nthere we go, I want to set this one.\n\n362\n00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:15.290\n&gt;&gt; Vonne,\nsometimes these tools are kinda finicky,\n\n363\n00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:18.435\nespecially these little\nbit laden with magic.\n\n364\n00:19:18.435 --> 00:19:19.740\nI know what this tool is trying to do.\n\n365\n00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:23.134\nIt's trying to make transparent\na particularly selected color but\n\n366\n00:19:23.134 --> 00:19:26.640\nthat picture has a lot of colors so\nit may actually be working.\n\n367\n00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:31.780\nWe just can't see it, so that's kind of a\nbuyer beware kind of thing almost, right?\n\n368\n00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.079\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n369\n00:19:33.079 --> 00:19:34.572\nYou know what I'm trying to do.\n\n370\n00:19:34.572 --> 00:19:36.683\nAnd while you are talking, I actually,\n\n371\n00:19:36.683 --> 00:19:40.340\nI don't really know why it's not\nworking on Bishop's picture.\n\n372\n00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:44.723\nIt's working on the other pictures I have\nin this file, so I'm gonna show you what\n\n373\n00:19:44.723 --> 00:19:49.090\nI'm trying to accomplish, but to pick for\nthe whole, but I want Bishop.\n\n374\n00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:52.596\nHonestly my solution would probably\nbe to delete the picture, start over,\n\n375\n00:19:52.596 --> 00:19:53.760\nput the picture back in.\n\n376\n00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:54.490\nSee if it works.\n\n377\n00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:58.575\nBut what I'm saying, you're trying\nto find one particular color.\n\n378\n00:19:58.575 --> 00:20:03.341\nAnd we're talking like down to\nthe pixel level to go ahead and try and\n\n379\n00:20:03.341 --> 00:20:04.860\nmake transparent.\n\n380\n00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:08.200\nSo it just might not be finding\nit on Bishop's picture.\n\n381\n00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.370\nOkay, stranger things have happened.\n\n382\n00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:14.031\nBut the other thing is, where I don't\nreally like this tool [LAUGH] either,\n\n383\n00:20:14.031 --> 00:20:16.020\ncuz I wanna show you\na better way to do it.\n\n384\n00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:17.427\nSo let me jump over here.\n\n385\n00:20:17.427 --> 00:20:20.690\nBut I do wanna show you, so\nlet's click this picture, okay?\n\n386\n00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.710\nThis is my azalea bush\nout in front of my house.\n\n387\n00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:28.568\nSo if I come over here to Color,\nand I go to Set Transparent Color,\n\n388\n00:20:28.568 --> 00:20:31.950\nI am picking a specific,\nlet's go with this green here.\n\n389\n00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:34.140\nBut you see how, look at that.\n\n390\n00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:37.170\nThat didn't pick out all the green,\nthe light green leaves.\n\n391\n00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:39.090\nNo, this is pixel-level.\n\n392\n00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:43.800\nSo it's trying to make this transparent,\nwhich it does make it transparent.\n\n393\n00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:48.090\nBut man, that just doesn't really work,\nand I could ahead and try, click,\n\n394\n00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:48.920\nclick, click.\n\n395\n00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:55.081\nThis would be really good for a very solid\ncolor picture and have very solid pixels,\n\n396\n00:20:55.081 --> 00:21:00.028\nlike maybe a GIF cuz a GIF file\ncan only support only 256 colors.\n\n397\n00:21:00.028 --> 00:21:03.320\nJPEGs can support up to 16 million colors.\n\n398\n00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:04.550\nSo that's what you're talking about.\n\n399\n00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:05.610\nSo it could work.\n\n400\n00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:09.280\nI don't want to discourage\nyou from trying this tool.\n\n401\n00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.420\nBut I'm just gonna undo and undo again.\n\n402\n00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:14.230\nThere's another cool thing.\n\n403\n00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:18.700\nI just wanna get rid of this background.\n\n404\n00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:23.220\nThere's Remove Background,\nwhich is really neat.\n\n405\n00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:25.910\nCaveat, it doesn't always work perfectly,\nokay?\n\n406\n00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:30.548\nYou gotta be very specific, but\nthe image has to be specific enough for\n\n407\n00:21:30.548 --> 00:21:35.892\nit work like For it to be like \" look\nit's going to be like this all the time\".\n\n408\n00:21:35.892 --> 00:21:37.401\nNo.\nLet me show you, ok.\n\n409\n00:21:37.401 --> 00:21:38.774\nSo Remove background.\n\n410\n00:21:38.774 --> 00:21:40.285\nThis picture right here,\n\n411\n00:21:40.285 --> 00:21:44.406\nnotice that this has that white\nbackground that we were talking about.\n\n412\n00:21:44.406 --> 00:21:45.160\nIt is a JPEG.\n\n413\n00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.876\nI don't want that to be here.\n\n414\n00:21:46.876 --> 00:21:48.455\nWe want to remove that out.\n\n415\n00:21:48.455 --> 00:21:51.476\nI could try using that Pick\nthe transparent thing but\n\n416\n00:21:51.476 --> 00:21:56.280\nit still won't be worthwhile\neither You have Remove Background.\n\n417\n00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:59.992\nWhen I have a picture selected and\nI do this, the cool thing is,\n\n418\n00:21:59.992 --> 00:22:02.513\nnow this is kind of\na weird example cuz I have\n\n419\n00:22:02.513 --> 00:22:06.736\na flower that's almost the exact\nsame color as the Remove Background.\n\n420\n00:22:06.736 --> 00:22:11.550\nBut what it's doing is it's\nfinding the background and saying,\n\n421\n00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:14.870\nhey, this is what I want to get rid of.\n\n422\n00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:17.902\nLet me show you on,\nlet's say, another picture.\n\n423\n00:22:17.902 --> 00:22:21.553\nThis one would be horrible\nto do this example.\n\n424\n00:22:21.553 --> 00:22:26.140\nIf I try to remove the background,\nit's like I don't understand.\n\n425\n00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:29.539\nBut notice everywhere where\nit is being a magenta,\n\n426\n00:22:29.539 --> 00:22:32.076\nthat's where it's going to remove.\n\n427\n00:22:32.076 --> 00:22:36.810\nEverywhere where it's clear, if you\nwanna say, that's what it's keeping.\n\n428\n00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:39.908\nAnd what you can do, again,\nthis is a bad example.\n\n429\n00:22:39.908 --> 00:22:44.490\nYou can mark areas to keep,\nor mark areas to remove.\n\n430\n00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:51.430\nIf I go ahead and say, hey, I wanna try\nto remove all of these parts in here,\n\n431\n00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:55.230\nand I start just kind of drawing\nmy mouse around and say use that.\n\n432\n00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:56.830\nAnd see, it does a pretty good job.\n\n433\n00:22:56.830 --> 00:23:02.761\nAnd I could go, let's remove that, and\nlet's kind of remove this area over here.\n\n434\n00:23:02.761 --> 00:23:07.336\nSo it's just gonna keep on adding\nto what we would call the mask.\n\n435\n00:23:07.336 --> 00:23:11.062\nBut then I do wanna keep,\nI change over here to keep,\n\n436\n00:23:11.062 --> 00:23:15.165\nI wanna keep like my arm right here But\nyou see how it's\n\n437\n00:23:15.165 --> 00:23:20.120\nevaluating the pixels and the colors and\nwhat to keep and everything.\n\n438\n00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:24.420\nAnd it's like, let's just say you could be\nworking on this for a long a time to try\n\n439\n00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:27.681\nto get this really good because\nit's just a very busy picture.\n\n440\n00:23:27.681 --> 00:23:32.860\nIf I click Keep the Changes,\nnotice that that one looks really jagged.\n\n441\n00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:35.640\nAnd all of that area around it is gone.\n\n442\n00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:40.612\nSo Remove Background is a pretty cool\noption if you have a photo that's gonna\n\n443\n00:23:40.612 --> 00:23:41.865\nwork really well.\n\n444\n00:23:41.865 --> 00:23:45.965\nSo for example, on here,\nusing that one level,\n\n445\n00:23:45.965 --> 00:23:50.165\nif I take this and\nI want to remove the background,\n\n446\n00:23:50.165 --> 00:23:55.076\nit did a pretty good job of\npicking all of the green leaves.\n\n447\n00:23:55.076 --> 00:24:00.260\nAnd if I just click Save Changes,\nthat's not that bad, is it?\n\n448\n00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:05.173\nBecause it was allowed to do that,\nwell, the colors allow it to do it\n\n449\n00:24:05.173 --> 00:24:10.460\nbecause it can evaluate it much better,\nthey're all very similar.\n\n450\n00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:12.340\nThe other one with all those crazy colors,\n\n451\n00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:15.490\nthat's going to get\na little nuts on that one.\n\n452\n00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:20.010\nSo, the same thing with this picture here,\nbut notice that if I just clicked OK,\n\n453\n00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:23.960\nit actually cut off those little leaves.\n\n454\n00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:27.200\nSo you need to go back into it and\nsay, all right, well,\n\n455\n00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:31.410\nI want to keep this area right here.\n\n456\n00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:36.960\nAnd then keep this area, and keep this\narea, whoops, I gotta little bit of white.\n\n457\n00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:41.299\nIt did a pretty good job of\nevaluating that a little bit more.\n\n458\n00:24:41.299 --> 00:24:45.872\nAnd then we keep it, and there,\nI've removed all of the white,\n\n459\n00:24:45.872 --> 00:24:50.361\nnow notice when I go ahead and\nstart adding things like glows and\n\n460\n00:24:50.361 --> 00:24:54.189\neverything, let's go with a glow here,\na blue one.\n\n461\n00:24:54.189 --> 00:24:57.798\nNotice how now it's going around\nthe flower, and not the box,\n\n462\n00:24:57.798 --> 00:25:02.238\nif I hadn't removed the background I\nwouldn't have been able to apply that.\n\n463\n00:25:02.238 --> 00:25:07.711\nSo pretty cool stuff, removing\nbackground can be able to get rid of it,\n\n464\n00:25:07.711 --> 00:25:12.050\nif the photo is in the right\ninformation basically.\n\n465\n00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:15.540\nSo, all right, so\nlet me look over my notes here,\n\n466\n00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:19.910\nwe've done pretty much\neverything I have on the list.\n\n467\n00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:22.230\nThere is one that you can go ahead and\n\n468\n00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:26.160\ndom a Change Picture, so\nlet's go back over to here.\n\n469\n00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:29.580\nI have Fuego, I'm on Sheet 1,\nand I've got Fuego.\n\n470\n00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.780\nI like the effect that I've put on it,\nI like the borders,\n\n471\n00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:34.690\nI like everything about it.\n\n472\n00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:38.920\nI just don't like Fuego, no,\nI love Fuego, sometimes I don't like him.\n\n473\n00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:43.600\nBut anyways, if I go ahead and\ntake this, and choose Change Picture,\n\n474\n00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:47.020\nwhat I'm saying,\nis I would like to go ahead and\n\n475\n00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:51.590\nkeep all of the effects,\njust change out the photograph.\n\n476\n00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:52.530\nSo that's kind of nice,\n\n477\n00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:56.230\ninstead of let me put a new picture in,\ndo all the same formatting.\n\n478\n00:25:56.230 --> 00:26:00.180\nSo that's why Change Picture\ncan be Pretty fun and easy for\n\n479\n00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:02.570\nyou if you like all\nthe changes that you've made.\n\n480\n00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:07.980\nWe've gone over the compress images,\nwe've gone over the reset images,\n\n481\n00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:12.230\nwe've talked about the picture format,\njust reading my notes.\n\n482\n00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:17.050\nThe biggest one that We need to\ntalk about is alternate text.\n\n483\n00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:20.450\nAnd Justin, you know a little bit\nabout this, cuz in web design,\n\n484\n00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:27.270\nwe have to put the alt attribute on our\nimage tag, and the importance of that.\n\n485\n00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:29.700\nSo what do you know about this?\n\n486\n00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:33.100\n&gt;&gt; Well, so from what I know,\nthere's a couple things.\n\n487\n00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:36.830\nIt's good for accessibility,\nif someone has maybe vision problems, or\n\n488\n00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:38.343\nmaybe using a screen reader.\n\n489\n00:26:38.343 --> 00:26:41.853\nOr maybe they're even using a text-based\nbrowser I know that's, like,\n\n490\n00:26:41.853 --> 00:26:42.809\nblowing your mind.\n\n491\n00:26:42.809 --> 00:26:47.460\nThat provides an alternative to seeing\nthe image, maybe a short description.\n\n492\n00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:50.680\nTypically I don't put paragraphs and\n\n493\n00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:55.020\nparagraphs in there, but\nfairly descript what-is-this-image.\n\n494\n00:26:55.020 --> 00:27:00.360\nIn addition to it-will-be-displayed If the\nimage is not available for some reason.\n\n495\n00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:05.640\nSo both of those are good\nreasons to have an alt text.\n\n496\n00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:09.840\nYou can get away with leaving them out,\nbut then, the image is not available.\n\n497\n00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.240\nWhy is this giant box with nothing in it?\n\n498\n00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.210\nWe had an alt text it'd be like,\npicture of Fuego.\n\n499\n00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:16.420\nYeah, that's what that's for.\n\n500\n00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:17.810\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah, accessability.\n\n501\n00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:23.500\nIt's a big deal, especially if you're in\nany type of governmental Institution,\n\n502\n00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:28.290\nor public sector, you need to make\nsure that you are ADA compliant.\n\n503\n00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:32.960\nAnd, you need to make sure you have\ncertain things, to be accessible for\n\n504\n00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:33.870\npeople with disabilities.\n\n505\n00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:39.410\nAnd, one of them, a big one,\nis alternative or alternate text.\n\n506\n00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:41.940\nIt's going to,\nlike you said, talk about or\n\n507\n00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:46.250\nsay picture of two adorable\ncats laying in bed together.\n\n508\n00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:48.440\nOkay, that's adorable\nbecause they love to snuggle.\n\n509\n00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.050\nOkay, those are things that you add.\n\n510\n00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:53.411\nSo, let me show where to find this,\nif any picture you have selected.\n\n511\n00:27:53.411 --> 00:28:00.064\nAnd this is in all of your windows,\nnot windows, this is Office whoo, okay.\n\n512\n00:28:00.064 --> 00:28:04.319\nSo all of your Office products I'm gonna\nget into the picture tasks thing, so\n\n513\n00:28:04.319 --> 00:28:08.800\nI'm gonna right click and\ngo to format picture and it is over here.\n\n514\n00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:09.740\nIt's in the size and\n\n515\n00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:13.560\nproperties because you are adding\nmetadata properties to this image.\n\n516\n00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:18.110\nAnd it's right there where is says alt\ntext, span this out, there is two pieces,\n\n517\n00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:20.300\nthere is a title, and a description.\n\n518\n00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:24.040\nI will tell you,\nthat I was always told it's just a title.\n\n519\n00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:32.760\nOkay, you can just say two\ncute cats snuggling, okay.\n\n520\n00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.765\nLet's make's sure we spell that right,\nsnuggling.\n\n521\n00:28:34.765 --> 00:28:38.340\n[LAUGH]\nTyping, and\n\n522\n00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:40.750\nI've always put it in the title,\ncuz that was the short one.\n\n523\n00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:42.800\nAnd then the description is\nwhere you would go ahead and\n\n524\n00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:48.160\nput a longer version of it,\nthat's always what I was taught.\n\n525\n00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:53.810\nI have an article that I have in the\nepisode notes, that I think is something\n\n526\n00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:58.690\ngood that you should read, and\nthis is dated a little bit,\n\n527\n00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:03.050\nbut it's just a really cool article\nabout where you should put this.\n\n528\n00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:07.160\nIt talks about with HTML, it talks\nabout like in your Word document and\n\n529\n00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:07.970\nwhere to find it.\n\n530\n00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:11.340\nSo definitely go back and read it,\nbut I thought this was interesting.\n\n531\n00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:15.090\nUse description, not title,\nit's like, really.\n\n532\n00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:17.820\nAnd it explains a lot more\nof why they talk about this,\n\n533\n00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:19.720\nand the different screen readers,\nand why they put that.\n\n534\n00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:22.860\nBut this is something for\nme that I always thought is backwards.\n\n535\n00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:27.420\nI was like, just put the title\non the description, okay, cool.\n\n536\n00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:30.470\nSo I just thought that was interesting,\ndefinitely read this.\n\n537\n00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:33.730\nSo okay well now I know that I\nshould go ahead and do this, or\n\n538\n00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:35.700\nmaybe I should go ahead and\nstart doing this more often.\n\n539\n00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:38.200\nSo I'll just put this in\nthe description and not the title.\n\n540\n00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:41.870\nMaybe put it in both just to\ncover yourself, but maybe do\n\n541\n00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:44.580\na little bit more research on this,\nand kind of look in some other places.\n\n542\n00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:47.750\nI just I always found\nthat article interesting,\n\n543\n00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:51.670\nso it's a good read about kind of like an\nintroduction into accessibility as well.\n\n544\n00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:53.410\nBut now you know where,\n\n545\n00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:58.500\nin any of your Office products, where\nto add alternate text on your images.\n\n546\n00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:03.210\nAnd I believe that pretty much concludes\neverything that I wanted to talk about\n\n547\n00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:08.060\nin formatting images, and yeah that\ntransparency tool, gets me every time.\n\n548\n00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:10.820\nI honestly thought about 'do\nI need to show them this?\n\n549\n00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:13.170\nlet me just show them removed\nbackground,' and then like of course,\n\n550\n00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:15.920\nyou want to go ahead and\nbackfire me, thanks.\n\n551\n00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:20.330\n&gt;&gt; I'll tell you what Vonne, anytime I'm\ntrying to use some of those magic tools,\n\n552\n00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:22.640\nlike please work,\nplease work, you didn't work.\n\n553\n00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:26.040\nBut the remove background, Vonne was\ntalking about it has to be just so,\n\n554\n00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.480\nthere are some assumptions when\nyou talk about background.\n\n555\n00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.440\nBackground is typically\ndarker than the foreground,\n\n556\n00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:35.610\nalso it's easier on pictures where you\nhave very stark color differences,\n\n557\n00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:38.430\nbecause that helps define the edges.\n\n558\n00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:42.390\nSo behind the scenes, I know this is\ngonna blow your mind, lots of math.\n\n559\n00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:46.640\nSo they run across pixels and they go hey,\nthere's a giant jump in color, or\n\n560\n00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:48.010\na giant difference in color.\n\n561\n00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:51.330\nThat's probably an edge,\nat least by color,\n\n562\n00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:52.710\nthere's some other things\nthat can come about.\n\n563\n00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:55.850\nSo, mileage may vary as we've seen,\n\n564\n00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:59.484\nI will tell you that picture of Bishop\nthat you did, absolutely terrifying.\n\n565\n00:30:59.484 --> 00:31:02.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But don't be terrified about coming\n\n566\n00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.890\nback and seeing what else we have in\nstore for you, in Excel 2016 advanced for\n\n567\n00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:09.150\nMac, but for now we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n568\n00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:12.000\nSo signing off for Office Pro Tv,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n569\n00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:12.685\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Von Smith.\n\n570\n00:31:12.685 --> 00:31:14.771\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n571\n00:31:14.771 --> 00:31:21.814\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:17.191\nI'm your host Justin Dennison.\n\n4\n00:00:17.191 --> 00:00:20.077\nAnd well, you asked for it, so\nwe're bringing it back at you,\n\n5\n00:00:20.077 --> 00:00:21.666\nExcel 2016 Advanced for Mac.\n\n6\n00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:25.240\nAnd we're gonna be looking\nat arranging shapes.\n\n7\n00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.950\nWhat do you mean, Justin,\narranging shapes?\n\n8\n00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.060\nLuckily, I'm not the one\ngonna tell you all about it.\n\n9\n00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.110\nWe have someone else who is,\nMs. Vonne Smith.\n\n10\n00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.160\nHow you doing today, Vonne?\n\n11\n00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.700\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, [LAUGH] how are you?\n\n12\n00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.410\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, and\nthat came off a little informercialesque.\n\n13\n00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.690\nBut that's all right because I kind of\nalluded to it in the previous episode.\n\n14\n00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.320\nIf you haven't checked out our\nformatting shapes episode doing\n\n15\n00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.210\nsome other things, right?\n\n16\n00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.810\nHaving shapes, it's all kinds of fun.\n\n17\n00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.420\nThen we got some other things\nthat we could do with shapes but\n\n18\n00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.130\nwe didn't have enough time so\n\n19\n00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.670\nthis is kind of a continuation of\nother things you can do, right Vonne?\n\n20\n00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.084\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, with our graphical\nelements like how do I arrange them?\n\n21\n00:01:05.084 --> 00:01:06.628\nYes that's the title of this show.\n\n22\n00:01:06.628 --> 00:01:12.160\nBut in the, and that's actually really\ngoing off of the group name on the ribbon.\n\n23\n00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.706\nIn the arrange group of tools,\nyou can do things like group,\n\n24\n00:01:16.706 --> 00:01:22.105\nyou can align, you can rotate,\nyou can change the stacking order.\n\n25\n00:01:22.105 --> 00:01:26.655\nAll the things that you're working with\nthese elements, whether it be an image, or\n\n26\n00:01:26.655 --> 00:01:29.955\na shape, or Smart Art graphic, or\n\n27\n00:01:29.955 --> 00:01:32.475\neven a chart,\nall of these are graphical elements.\n\n28\n00:01:32.475 --> 00:01:38.230\nSo how to arrange them on the worksheet,\nor page, is something that's important.\n\n29\n00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.251\nAnd this goes across all\ngraphical elements in,\n\n30\n00:01:41.251 --> 00:01:45.311\nreally, all of the Office products,\nso it's not just in Excel.\n\n31\n00:01:45.311 --> 00:01:48.666\nSo, if you've seen this episode in\nsome of your other products, well,\n\n32\n00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:50.320\nyou've probably already seen it.\n\n33\n00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.747\nSo, [LAUGH] So you're good.\nBut if this is the first time you've ever\n\n34\n00:01:52.747 --> 00:01:56.930\nbeen seeing this, then, this is going\nto apply many different places.\n\n35\n00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.025\nSo why don't we get started\ndown into the computer.\n\n36\n00:02:01.025 --> 00:02:05.773\nAnd yes, this is what you were alluding\nto is that the sun and the text box,\n\n37\n00:02:05.773 --> 00:02:08.690\nthey weren't going together, were they?\n\n38\n00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.588\nAnd that's what you're like, [SOUND] we've\ngotta put those together, don't we, right?\n\n39\n00:02:12.588 --> 00:02:16.600\nSo that's the things we were going to be\ntalking about in this particular episode.\n\n40\n00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.440\n&gt;&gt; And this is actually what I was talking\nabout in the previous episode where I said\n\n41\n00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.390\nthat could be an absolute nightmare.\n\n42\n00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.600\nEspecially if you apply this\npattern all over the place.\n\n43\n00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.950\nThen you go, I'll just move this, it don't\nmove like I thought it was going to.\n\n44\n00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.370\nAnd then if you've forgotten to do that,\nthen, shenanigans.\n\n45\n00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.878\nBut now I'm kind of getting\nahead of us a little bit,\n\n46\n00:02:34.878 --> 00:02:36.827\nyou haven't even shown us how to fix it.\n\n47\n00:02:36.827 --> 00:02:38.973\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwell it's also one of those, well,\n\n48\n00:02:38.973 --> 00:02:40.745\nhow do I know if it's a group or not?\n\n49\n00:02:40.745 --> 00:02:46.350\nBecause sometimes it's not very apparent\nthat that is actually made up of multiple\n\n50\n00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.650\nelements that are being treated as one\nthing but they're your individual pieces.\n\n51\n00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.970\nSo I'm gonna show you about the selection\npane which is really really cool and\n\n52\n00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.560\nsomething very neat and\nMac specific product,\n\n53\n00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.640\nthis is where something that\nMac has that Windows doesn't.\n\n54\n00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.240\nMy gosh, yeah it's crazy.\n\n55\n00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.480\nIt's small, and all the good things.\n\n56\n00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.640\nSo let's do this, let's start a new\nworksheet, kind of like blank this paper.\n\n57\n00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.410\nI'm just gonna zoom out a little bit,\ncuz we don't really need to see anything\n\n58\n00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.170\nthat's going on in the cells,\nwe're adding different graphical elements.\n\n59\n00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.650\nSo let's go to Insert,\nand let's go to Shapes.\n\n60\n00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:28.030\nAnd we will, you know what, let's pick\na circle, all right, we'll make a circle.\n\n61\n00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.170\nAnd then we'll come over here.\n\n62\n00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.610\nNotice that I'm on the Shapes Format\nribbon, or the tab on the ribbon.\n\n63\n00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.645\nI can add another shape from here, okay?\n\n64\n00:03:35.645 --> 00:03:39.710\nSo you don't always have to go back to the\nInsert tab, I might have done that once or\n\n65\n00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.673\nand the other one, so\nwe are going to make an oval like so.\n\n66\n00:03:43.673 --> 00:03:44.911\nDo you know what?\n\n67\n00:03:44.911 --> 00:03:46.480\nWhy don't we do this.\n\n68\n00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.122\nWe are going to make this one smaller.\n\n69\n00:03:49.122 --> 00:03:52.754\nThere is a reason why I am doing all this,\nI promise.\n\n70\n00:03:52.754 --> 00:03:57.212\nI am going to make this one smaller and\nwe are going to false drag,\n\n71\n00:03:57.212 --> 00:04:02.138\nsomething we talked about in the other\nepisode What that means is we're\n\n72\n00:04:02.138 --> 00:04:06.200\nduplicating, okay, we are going to hold\nthe Alt key, drag over to the side.\n\n73\n00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.175\nMaybe do it one more time,\nand then make this bigger,\n\n74\n00:04:11.175 --> 00:04:14.504\nand we will go ahead and do one more.\n\n75\n00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:16.850\nYep, I am doing this on the fly.\n\n76\n00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.080\nLet's do a line tool, and what we're\ngonna do is we're gonna do this,\n\n77\n00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.270\nlet's do a Scribble or Freeform,\nokay, why don't we try this one.\n\n78\n00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.210\nSo if I go ahead and\nI'm just gonna draw a little, oops,\n\n79\n00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.260\nI forgot with the Freeform\nyou can just keep on going.\n\n80\n00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.025\nOkay, I don't wanna do that.\n\n81\n00:04:33.025 --> 00:04:36.770\nSo you know what, I'm going to\ndouble-click and then it just stops it.\n\n82\n00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.360\nBecause I just realized, half way through,\nwait yeah, the Freeform is where you can\n\n83\n00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.584\nlike click on and drag, and\nclick, click, click click, and\n\n84\n00:04:44.584 --> 00:04:49.198\nmake it to where when you double-click, it\ncloses that path, and you're ready to go.\n\n85\n00:04:49.198 --> 00:04:53.202\nWhat I really wanna to do,\nwas I wanna go ahead, and\n\n86\n00:04:53.202 --> 00:04:56.670\nlet's just go with this one, okay?\n\n87\n00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.710\nYeah, we'll go like so.\n\n88\n00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.080\nI have a reason for all of this, okay?\n\n89\n00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.713\nAnd let's go ahead and\nmake this a little bit thicker, and\n\n90\n00:05:07.713 --> 00:05:11.290\nperfect, wonderful.\n\n91\n00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.729\nWe got all our little pieces.\n\n92\n00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.012\nYou got any idea what we're\ngonna be doing over here Justin?\n\n93\n00:05:16.012 --> 00:05:19.539\n&gt;&gt; I got a funny feeling we're\nabout to play Mr. Potato Head.\n\n94\n00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:26.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Close, close,\nkeep that thought [LAUGH].\n\n95\n00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.050\nYou haven't done enough shows with\nme before I draw this particular\n\n96\n00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.880\nfun little thing.\n\n97\n00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.100\nSo we've got our shapes, wonderful.\n\n98\n00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.094\nWell, what I wanna do is I want to\ntake this and I want to rotate this.\n\n99\n00:05:39.094 --> 00:05:45.498\nI wanna rotate this like so,\nnow do you know what we might be building?\n\n100\n00:05:45.498 --> 00:05:47.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] exactly.\n\n101\n00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.230\nSo now what I wanna do here is\nI want to make another shape.\n\n102\n00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.545\nBecause we are drawing a bunny, yes.\n\n103\n00:05:54.545 --> 00:05:57.996\nWe're going to make a bunny out\nof our shapes to go ahead and\n\n104\n00:05:57.996 --> 00:06:02.928\ndemonstrate all of these concepts so a lot\nof stuff, everything that we've done so\n\n105\n00:06:02.928 --> 00:06:04.971\nfar has been pretty much a review.\n\n106\n00:06:04.971 --> 00:06:07.226\nYou've seen me do some of this stuff.\n\n107\n00:06:07.226 --> 00:06:10.520\nWe're going to go over\ninto our shape format tool\n\n108\n00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.100\nbecause this is where in\nthis Arrange section, okay.\n\n109\n00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.650\nAnd again, with the resolution higher,\nyou'll see across better.\n\n110\n00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.720\nNotice we have these Bring forward,\nSend it backwards, Selection pane,\n\n111\n00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.764\nReorder objects.\n\n112\n00:06:21.764 --> 00:06:27.000\nAll of these are going to be\ndealing with stacking orders, okay?\n\n113\n00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.170\nBecause we had actually talked about that\nwith that with the z index about what's on\n\n114\n00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.207\ntop when we were doing our screenshots.\n\n115\n00:06:33.207 --> 00:06:35.895\nWell this is gonna make a big\ndifference to us here, about do I\n\n116\n00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:40.010\nwanna bring something to the front, or\ndo I wanna bring something to the back.\n\n117\n00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:41.452\nWe'll get to that in a little bit.\n\n118\n00:06:41.452 --> 00:06:44.727\nThe selection pane is probably one of my\nfavorite things in the Office products\n\n119\n00:06:44.727 --> 00:06:46.770\nwhen your'e dealing with\ngraphical elements.\n\n120\n00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:52.423\nBecause it will show you everything\nthat is a graphical element,\n\n121\n00:06:52.423 --> 00:06:58.504\non your for this sense, worksheet,\nor if you're in Word on the page.\n\n122\n00:06:58.504 --> 00:07:02.368\nSo you can see I have an oval 1,\n2, 3, 4, and an arch.\n\n123\n00:07:02.368 --> 00:07:08.471\nThe stacking order,\nthis is where arch 6 is on top,\n\n124\n00:07:08.471 --> 00:07:13.479\nmeaning if I took this and\nI drag this over.\n\n125\n00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:18.342\nAnd maybe I'll go ahead and change\nthe line color we'll make it yellow for\n\n126\n00:07:18.342 --> 00:07:19.134\nright now.\n\n127\n00:07:19.134 --> 00:07:25.680\nNotice that when I come over here,\nit is on top of everything, right.\n\n128\n00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:31.549\nBut if I took this shape and then I made\nit let's just say make it pink right,\n\n129\n00:07:31.549 --> 00:07:35.007\nand I pull this, look at where it's going.\n\n130\n00:07:35.007 --> 00:07:39.343\nDo you see how it's going\nbehind some of the shapes, but\n\n131\n00:07:39.343 --> 00:07:43.321\nit's also going on top of\nsome of the other shapes?\n\n132\n00:07:43.321 --> 00:07:47.499\nBecause it goes, the big circle,\nthen the small circle,\n\n133\n00:07:47.499 --> 00:07:50.144\nthen the oval right there because and\n\n134\n00:07:50.144 --> 00:07:54.938\nyou can see over here that it is in\nthe middle of the stacking order.\n\n135\n00:07:54.938 --> 00:08:00.446\nAnd this is where I might want\nto bring this shape On top or\n\n136\n00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:03.387\nin front of everything else.\n\n137\n00:08:03.387 --> 00:08:05.510\nOn top of this big one.\n\n138\n00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:08.520\nSo this is where you could do it through\nthe selection pane because it's pretty\n\n139\n00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:09.570\nawesome.\n\n140\n00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:13.770\nOr, let's just go ahead and\ndo the commands here on the ribbon.\n\n141\n00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:19.860\nIf I wanna bring it to the front or\nbring it forward, what does that mean?\n\n142\n00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:23.776\nOne step would mean bring forward.\n\n143\n00:08:23.776 --> 00:08:26.345\nTo the front means all\nthe way to the front.\n\n144\n00:08:26.345 --> 00:08:28.852\nIt's kind of like people cutting in line,\nif you wanna say.\n\n145\n00:08:28.852 --> 00:08:32.520\nLike, I wanna get to the front, and\nthat's kinda what I wanna do right here.\n\n146\n00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.376\nSo I'm gonna bring it to the front and\nthen, boop, there it goes.\n\n147\n00:08:35.376 --> 00:08:38.090\nNow it is on top.\n\n148\n00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:41.690\nWe might need to change this color\nbecause we don't want a bunny with a, cuz\n\n149\n00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:44.640\nsometimes those bunnies with the red eyes,\nthey kinda freak me out a little bit.\n\n150\n00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.400\nI won't lie, so that's just me.\n\n151\n00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.060\nOkay, all right, perfect.\n\n152\n00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.115\nThat's one way we could do it.\n\n153\n00:08:49.115 --> 00:08:53.810\nNow I could do the same thing for\nthis particular circle.\n\n154\n00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:57.533\nBut I don't wanna do it through the\nbuttons where I can say bring forward or\n\n155\n00:08:57.533 --> 00:08:59.965\nsend to the back, those types of things.\n\n156\n00:08:59.965 --> 00:09:01.135\nI wanna use the selection pane.\n\n157\n00:09:01.135 --> 00:09:02.645\nCuz it's so much cooler to do it this way.\n\n158\n00:09:02.645 --> 00:09:04.665\nAt least I feel this way.\n\n159\n00:09:04.665 --> 00:09:05.895\nI click on the circle.\n\n160\n00:09:05.895 --> 00:09:08.025\nI can see the oval one is right here.\n\n161\n00:09:08.025 --> 00:09:13.700\nAll you gotta do is grab this and\ndrag it up, and notice those little lines,\n\n162\n00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.970\nto where when you see the blue line of\nwhere you want it to go, you let go.\n\n163\n00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.400\nAnd then it changes the stacking order.\n\n164\n00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.850\nThat's so cool.\n\n165\n00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.104\nAll right, so\nthen I could go ahead and take this.\n\n166\n00:09:24.104 --> 00:09:27.764\nI don't think it's the exact same size,\nbut it's close enough for right now.\n\n167\n00:09:27.764 --> 00:09:32.613\nSo the selection pane can really\nhelp with changing the stacking\n\n168\n00:09:32.613 --> 00:09:35.370\norder of what we need it to do.\n\n169\n00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:40.650\nAnd then the other cool thing is that\nit will let you turn things on and off.\n\n170\n00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:44.150\nSo sometimes if you're doing a lot of\ngraphical work, you might need to like,\n\n171\n00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.694\nI wanna keep this but\nI wanna turn it off for a little bit but\n\n172\n00:09:46.694 --> 00:09:47.876\nI don't wanna delete it.\n\n173\n00:09:47.876 --> 00:09:50.650\nThat's what these eyeballs\nare over here for.\n\n174\n00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:55.515\nIf you poke out the eyeball, then it turns\nthat particular graphical element off.\n\n175\n00:09:55.515 --> 00:09:58.380\nSo the little dash means it's not there.\n\n176\n00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:01.720\nSo you can turn them on,\nturn them off, pretty cool.\n\n177\n00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.890\nOops, that is not what\nI wanted to select and\n\n178\n00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:05.670\nthen maybe I will take this little guy.\n\n179\n00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:10.300\nWow, this is where you gotta be very\ncareful and watch your mouse cursor icon.\n\n180\n00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:15.100\nI always tell people that, but I'm making\nsure that I wanna grab right there.\n\n181\n00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.300\nPerfect, cuz I wanna rotate this and\n\n182\n00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:22.440\nit's going to be,\nlook at that cute little bunny.\n\n183\n00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.570\nOkay, we're getting there, okay?\n\n184\n00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:27.060\nIt's got a kind of a little\nsmirk going on right now.\n\n185\n00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:31.348\nAll right, lovely, so these are some of\nthe different things that I can be doing\n\n186\n00:10:31.348 --> 00:10:33.014\nwith my shapes in the Arrange.\n\n187\n00:10:33.014 --> 00:10:37.502\nStacking them, moving them around,\nchanging where they're going,\n\n188\n00:10:37.502 --> 00:10:38.820\nrotating them.\n\n189\n00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:43.440\nNow the thing is I could,\nyou saw me rotating from here, right,\n\n190\n00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.370\nfrom the little rotation handle.\n\n191\n00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:51.790\nBut there's another option right\nhere to where flip horizontal,\n\n192\n00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:54.350\nflip vertical, or rotate 90 degrees.\n\n193\n00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:57.650\nThat can be really handy for\nexample like this.\n\n194\n00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:02.690\nIf I take this and I Alt drag,\nwhich would mean duplicate,\n\n195\n00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:08.850\nI could rotate it up here, but\nI basically just wanna turn it over.\n\n196\n00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:15.130\nThis is the perfect example of why you\nwould want to just flip it horizontal.\n\n197\n00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:19.950\nSo it's the same rotation angle from\nthis way, now it's on this side.\n\n198\n00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:21.050\nSo that could be kinda fun.\n\n199\n00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:24.490\nSo I'll take that and\nmove that over here, perfect.\n\n200\n00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:31.110\nSome other things we can do with aligning,\nwell, I already said, I said it.\n\n201\n00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:34.057\nAligning, arranging our elements,\n\n202\n00:11:34.057 --> 00:11:39.396\nI wanna make sure that these two\nshapes are aligned either to the top,\n\n203\n00:11:39.396 --> 00:11:44.109\nto the bottom,\nI just wanna make sure they're even, okay?\n\n204\n00:11:44.109 --> 00:11:46.766\nSo how can we select multiple elements?\n\n205\n00:11:46.766 --> 00:11:50.630\nCuz right now we've been clicking on one,\nclicking on the other.\n\n206\n00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:53.514\nThat's great, but\nif I want to select both of them,\n\n207\n00:11:53.514 --> 00:11:55.556\ncuz you can't align a single thing.\n\n208\n00:11:55.556 --> 00:12:01.190\nYou have to align at least two or\nmore elements.\n\n209\n00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:03.330\nDo you know the keyboard shortcut or\n\n210\n00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:07.520\nthe key to hold to select\nmultiple graphical elements?\n\n211\n00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.720\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna say Command.\n\n212\n00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:11.914\n&gt;&gt; How about another guess?\n\n213\n00:12:11.914 --> 00:12:13.666\n&gt;&gt; Control.\n&gt;&gt; How about one more?\n\n214\n00:12:13.666 --> 00:12:14.741\n&gt;&gt; Shift.\n\n215\n00:12:14.741 --> 00:12:16.177\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n216\n00:12:16.177 --> 00:12:20.280\n&gt;&gt; So it's funny that you bring,\nI always said, I'm like, wait a minute.\n\n217\n00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:24.940\nIn this advocation, is it command or\nis it Shift or is it Control?\n\n218\n00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:27.200\nCuz it differs over\na few things that I use.\n\n219\n00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.560\nSo I'm always like, no, that ain't it.\n\n220\n00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.900\nThere it is.\nThere it is.\n\n221\n00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:32.570\nSo then I have to do\nsome contact switching.\n\n222\n00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:33.530\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely.\n\n223\n00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:37.580\nWhen you're talking about shapes, and\nI guess for me, it's always Shift.\n\n224\n00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:41.281\nBut that's just because I've worked\nin a lot of graphical products like\n\n225\n00:12:41.281 --> 00:12:43.840\nPhotoshop and Illustrator and\nthings like that.\n\n226\n00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:49.240\nIt's always Shift to select multiples,\nbut we're talking about cells in Excel.\n\n227\n00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:52.600\nShift is a range, isn't it?\n\n228\n00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.950\nAnd Command is where you could\nselect multiple cells, so\n\n229\n00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:59.760\nyes, it was a great point,\nwhat context are we working in?\n\n230\n00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:05.680\nWith elements, like graphical shapes and\nthings, it's going to be Shift.\n\n231\n00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.330\nSo if I hold my Shift key,\nI can select both of those ears and\n\n232\n00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.530\nthen I can align them.\n\n233\n00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:13.050\nNow with our align,\n\n234\n00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:16.350\nit's nice that they give you these little\nkind of buttons, if you wanna say.\n\n235\n00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:19.330\nSome kind of shortcuts, not shortcuts.\n\n236\n00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.117\nHints, that's what I'm trying to say.\n\n237\n00:13:21.117 --> 00:13:23.385\nAlign the lefts, this wouldn't apply for\n\n238\n00:13:23.385 --> 00:13:26.787\nanything because I'm not aligning\nthings that are going down.\n\n239\n00:13:26.787 --> 00:13:28.685\nI'm aligning things that are going across.\n\n240\n00:13:28.685 --> 00:13:32.630\nAnd it's funny because it's like but\nI'm aligning things this way but\n\n241\n00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:33.860\nit says vertical.\n\n242\n00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.390\nBut you're aligning the vertical pieces.\n\n243\n00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:39.205\nYou're aligning the tops, or\nthe middle, or the bottom.\n\n244\n00:13:39.205 --> 00:13:43.070\nSo just look at the icons,\ndon't look at the words,\n\n245\n00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:46.295\ncuz that can kinda throw\nyou off a little bit.\n\n246\n00:13:46.295 --> 00:13:48.300\nSo I'm gonna align the bottoms.\n\n247\n00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:49.200\nAnd well, guess what?\n\n248\n00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.290\nThese were already aligned.\n\n249\n00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:51.650\nHow about I do this?\n\n250\n00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:54.000\nThere we go.\nNow, they're really off centered.\n\n251\n00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.030\nIf I select both of those, here,\nlet me zoom out a little bit, so\n\n252\n00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:58.220\nyou can see this.\n\n253\n00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:02.510\nI will then take the align,\nalign the bottoms, and there you go.\n\n254\n00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:05.360\nThey take in exactly that.\n\n255\n00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.322\nI might wanna do these\ntwo guys right here.\n\n256\n00:14:07.322 --> 00:14:12.373\nLet's go ahead and align the tops, okay?\n\n257\n00:14:12.373 --> 00:14:14.100\nNow these two are different sizes.\n\n258\n00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.760\nSo what I would do is I would\nactually just delete one of them.\n\n259\n00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.680\nTake the other one, Alt-drag.\n\n260\n00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.870\nAnd then I know that\nthey are the same size.\n\n261\n00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:26.606\nThen I will Shift-select both of them,\nand then at point,\n\n262\n00:14:26.606 --> 00:14:31.470\nthey're the same size, doesn't matter,\nI'll just align the tops.\n\n263\n00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:34.820\nSo now I know that those\ntwo eyes are the same.\n\n264\n00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:37.610\nI wanna move both of these ears down,\n\n265\n00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:42.840\nagain Shift to select them, and\nyou can move them both at the same time.\n\n266\n00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:47.910\nYou don't have to move one at a time.\n\n267\n00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:51.070\nAnd cuz I wanna maybe kinda\nput it back down here.\n\n268\n00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:53.690\nBut, oop, we got a little problem there,\ndon't we there, Justin?\n\n269\n00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:56.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it looks like we got\none at a different plane.\n\n270\n00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.430\nThat could get weird.\n\n271\n00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:59.170\nThat can be incredibly\nfrustrating as well.\n\n272\n00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:01.310\nYou're like, wait a mintue,\nthat's not right.\n\n273\n00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:03.825\nThese should both be behind or\nboth be in front.\n\n274\n00:15:03.825 --> 00:15:09.350\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, and that's where we'll go over\nto our selection pane and change them.\n\n275\n00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:10.690\nOo, you know what?\n\n276\n00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:15.910\nPerfect time to show you\nthe cool Mac interface\n\n277\n00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:21.550\nof the arranging your objects or\nreorder, sorry.\n\n278\n00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:23.853\nGet ready, hold one, ready?\n\n279\n00:15:23.853 --> 00:15:28.002\nCuz [SOUND] look at where we went!\n\n280\n00:15:28.002 --> 00:15:29.970\n[LAUGH] Isn't this crazy?\n\n281\n00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:30.964\n&gt;&gt; That is pretty slick.\n\n282\n00:15:30.964 --> 00:15:33.943\nIt might be a little overkill for Excel.\n\n283\n00:15:33.943 --> 00:15:34.457\n&gt;&gt; I know!\n\n284\n00:15:34.457 --> 00:15:36.570\n&gt;&gt; But it is pretty slick.\n\n285\n00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:38.310\n&gt;&gt; I know.\nJust like the first time I saw it,\n\n286\n00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:43.170\nI'm just like whoa, okay, yeah.\n\n287\n00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:47.407\nI think it's pretty handy, but yes,\nvery weird that it's in an Office product.\n\n288\n00:15:47.407 --> 00:15:49.981\nBut notice how when you hover,\n\n289\n00:15:49.981 --> 00:15:55.234\nit is showing you the order in\na very cool graphical interface.\n\n290\n00:15:55.234 --> 00:15:59.615\nSo I could take this one and\nI can click, hold and drag back.\n\n291\n00:15:59.615 --> 00:16:02.249\nAnd it does kind of like\nthe transparency and things like that.\n\n292\n00:16:02.249 --> 00:16:06.332\nI really could have just hit the button\nan said, send it back in the other place.\n\n293\n00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:09.766\nAnd then down behind my head,\nthere's two little buttons down there.\n\n294\n00:16:09.766 --> 00:16:11.960\nYou can see, you've got OK and Cancel.\n\n295\n00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:16.771\nSo if I wanted to say, yep, I'm good, you\nclick OK, and then ooh, did you see that?\n\n296\n00:16:16.771 --> 00:16:17.771\nThat was so cool.\n\n297\n00:16:17.771 --> 00:16:21.860\n&gt;&gt; That is some interesting wow-factor.\n\n298\n00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.011\nI don't know if I would\never actually use it.\n\n299\n00:16:24.011 --> 00:16:28.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Honestly, it's almost too much,\nit's overkill for me.\n\n300\n00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:33.260\nI'll just use the Selection Pane and\ngo from there and be good.\n\n301\n00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:37.720\nSome other things that you can do with the\nSelection Pane that might be kinda fun.\n\n302\n00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.690\nThese are just Oval 1, Oval 8, right?\n\n303\n00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:41.460\nThat doesn't make any sense, does it?\n\n304\n00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:42.290\nBut what is that?\n\n305\n00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:43.950\nThat's the ear.\n\n306\n00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:47.760\nSo you could, if you wanted to,\nyou can rename these layers.\n\n307\n00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:51.840\nAgain, very Photoshop-esque when you\nstart working with the Selection Pane.\n\n308\n00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:55.744\nSo if you just double-click,\njust like Photoshop,\n\n309\n00:16:55.744 --> 00:17:00.890\nwe could go ahead and just say ear-R for\nright, and then so on and so.\n\n310\n00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:03.640\nI might not necessarily go through\nevery single one of these, but\n\n311\n00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:07.430\nI think you get the idea that I could\ngo through and name each one of them.\n\n312\n00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:10.840\nPretty neat, lots of cool things\nyou can do with the Selection Pane.\n\n313\n00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.520\nSo now I've got a bunny, right?\n\n314\n00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:19.110\nWe've gotten some pretty cool things\nabout how to do an Arrange your elements,\n\n315\n00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:20.520\nthe Align.\n\n316\n00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:24.560\nWe did the Duplicate, we did Shift-click\nto select multiple elements,\n\n317\n00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:26.750\nwe've talked a lot about\nthe Selection Pane.\n\n318\n00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:32.400\nThe cool overdoing reordering of\nyour elements or objects in Mac.\n\n319\n00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:36.726\nGrouping, this little guy,\nwe've gotta keep it together, ooh,\n\n320\n00:17:36.726 --> 00:17:38.802\nthat's actually kinda cute, I like that.\n\n321\n00:17:38.802 --> 00:17:43.881\nBut [LAUGH] anyways, I wanna make\nsure that this all works together.\n\n322\n00:17:43.881 --> 00:17:44.500\nGrouping.\n\n323\n00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:47.180\nWe're actually gonna do a couple groups.\n\n324\n00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:47.840\nJust to have like,\n\n325\n00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.655\ncuz you can have a group, inside a group,\ninside a group, inside a group.\n\n326\n00:17:50.655 --> 00:17:53.380\nKinda like those Russian nesting dolls,\nright?\n\n327\n00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:53.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n328\n00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:58.220\n&gt;&gt; My grandmother would collect them cuz\nthey would travel all over the world, and\n\n329\n00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:59.360\nso they had tons of them.\n\n330\n00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:02.684\nI would play for\nhours with those things, right?\n\n331\n00:18:02.684 --> 00:18:03.460\nIt was so much fun.\n\n332\n00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:05.490\nAnd they were all different colors, and.\n\n333\n00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:07.980\nSorry, it just brings back some\ngood childhood memories of mine.\n\n334\n00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:13.440\nBut anyways, I want to show you how\nyou can nest groups within groups.\n\n335\n00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:18.070\nShift-click to select both the eyeballs,\ncuz I want these to be its own group.\n\n336\n00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:19.240\nHow do you do it?\n\n337\n00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.470\nMake sure you have multiple selections.\n\n338\n00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:27.648\nI tend to right-click, it's just kinda\none that I've grown up with doing, right?\n\n339\n00:18:27.648 --> 00:18:28.840\nSo you can go with Group.\n\n340\n00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:35.210\nYou could also come into the ribbon, and\ngo into a Range, and then, there it is.\n\n341\n00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:36.550\nWe can go with Group.\n\n342\n00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:37.630\nNotice we've got that.\n\n343\n00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:39.850\nWe click it, and then there you go.\n\n344\n00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:44.147\nNow, and this is one of those things\nwhere, if I didn't have a Selection Pane,\n\n345\n00:18:44.147 --> 00:18:48.449\nthat doesn't give me any indication\nwhen I single-click on this that there's\n\n346\n00:18:48.449 --> 00:18:50.004\ntwo pieces in this, right?\n\n347\n00:18:50.004 --> 00:18:54.936\nThat's the kinda hard part without using\nthe Selection Pane of like is that\n\n348\n00:18:54.936 --> 00:18:58.943\njust the shape,\nthe single shape that it's supposed to be?\n\n349\n00:18:58.943 --> 00:18:59.970\nI don't know.\n\n350\n00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:07.570\nBringing back the Selection Pane,\nor the Format Pane really.\n\n351\n00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:08.790\nThat's not what I want, I'm sorry.\n\n352\n00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:12.430\nI said the Selection Pane,\nwhich would be this one, there you go.\n\n353\n00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:14.590\nOkay, and\nactually now I have two panes open.\n\n354\n00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:19.680\nNotice I had the Format Shape task\npane and the Select task pane, cool.\n\n355\n00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.390\nI know it's a group cuz\nit says it right there.\n\n356\n00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:24.750\nThere's Group 9, okay.\n\n357\n00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:29.840\nSo this is a good way to see\nif you have grouped elements.\n\n358\n00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:33.635\nThe other thing, what if I wanted to\nchange one of the eyeballs, right?\n\n359\n00:19:33.635 --> 00:19:36.820\nI wanna just get one of them to be green,\nright?\n\n360\n00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.118\nCuz he just wants a green eye.\n\n361\n00:19:39.118 --> 00:19:44.290\nIf you single-click, or\nuse the Selection Pane, you can isolate\n\n362\n00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:49.670\npieces of a group and\nthen change just that one.\n\n363\n00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:54.115\nBecause if I had selected\njust the whole group and\n\n364\n00:19:54.115 --> 00:19:58.571\ncome into the color, see,\nit does both of them.\n\n365\n00:19:58.571 --> 00:20:04.000\nSo it's a nice way to be able to isolate\npieces of a group, know that it's a group,\n\n366\n00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.310\nand then be able to just make\nsome determinations from there.\n\n367\n00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:11.020\nYou could still go ahead and\ndo this without the Selection Pane.\n\n368\n00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:15.340\nIf I just single-clicked on one\nof the pieces within a group,\n\n369\n00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:17.650\nyou can still isolate that way.\n\n370\n00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:19.260\nTotally fine.\n\n371\n00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.460\nSo now if I wanna go ahead and\nget all of these,\n\n372\n00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:27.180\nI would select on its eyes,\nhold the Shift key, get there, get there.\n\n373\n00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:29.330\nEven better, you know what you can do?\n\n374\n00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:33.145\nYou can use your Shift key\nfrom the Selection Pane,\n\n375\n00:20:33.145 --> 00:20:36.610\nhaha, to select all of your elements.\n\n376\n00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:39.953\nSo especially if you're working\nwith really small pieces,\n\n377\n00:20:39.953 --> 00:20:41.927\nlike that mouth piece right there.\n\n378\n00:20:41.927 --> 00:20:47.730\nIt's kinda hard to get at because it's\ntiny, okay, so use this to your advantage.\n\n379\n00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:50.840\nSo once I have all of this,\nI can come up to here.\n\n380\n00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.650\nI can go to Group, and we'll group that.\n\n381\n00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:56.290\nAnd notice, there you go,\nthis is one piece.\n\n382\n00:20:56.290 --> 00:21:00.720\nSo now the whole bunny\ntravels as one piece.\n\n383\n00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:04.270\nI have these expandable and\ncollapsible groups, and so\n\n384\n00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:06.850\nI have a group within a group.\n\n385\n00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:10.150\nAnd then this is one whole piece.\n\n386\n00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:14.960\nSo grouping elements can be very,\nvery handy, like the sun and the text box.\n\n387\n00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:19.743\nMy bunny, I don't wanna have its\nears being away from its head.\n\n388\n00:21:19.743 --> 00:21:21.670\nThis is starting to get\nreally gruesome right now.\n\n389\n00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:25.340\nWe need to just keep the bunny intact and\nbe happy.\n\n390\n00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:28.550\nJust be careful about when you go\nahead and have a group and you select.\n\n391\n00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:32.070\nIt's like, okay,\nsee now everything has that same fill.\n\n392\n00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:36.060\nSo if you wanted to\nisolate individual pieces,\n\n393\n00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:42.060\nyou do have to select them by\nthemselves and then go from there.\n\n394\n00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:48.140\nSo if you want to make cute little\nbunnies on your Excel spreadsheet,\n\n395\n00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:54.090\ncuz at the time of this recording,\nit's almost, I call it bunny day.\n\n396\n00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:55.900\nBecause I love bunnies,\n\n397\n00:21:55.900 --> 00:22:00.200\nand so it's all about the bunnies,\nat least in my world, so.\n\n398\n00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:00.870\n&gt;&gt; Well, I will tell you,\n\n399\n00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:03.530\nVonne, seeing this little bunny\nmay make it a little easier\n\n400\n00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:07.950\nto swallow some of those bad reports that\ncould also be on that Excel spreadsheet.\n\n401\n00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:10.760\nYou're like, we lost ten grand,\nbut look at this bunny.\n\n402\n00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:14.610\nAnd you go, I do feel better, but\nwhat was that number you said?\n\n403\n00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:18.110\nSo these can be incredibly handy,\nand just as we've grouped,\n\n404\n00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:21.870\nyou can also ungroup as you've\nseen kind of down below, right?\n\n405\n00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:23.470\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely, and it is fun.\n\n406\n00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:26.025\nThere is one thing that\nI wanted to mention.\n\n407\n00:22:26.025 --> 00:22:29.220\nThat I looked at my notes, and\nI was like, ooh, just in case.\n\n408\n00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:31.870\nIn case you're coming from a PC world, and\n\n409\n00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:37.040\npretty much like the most recent versions\nof Excel with whatever update you have.\n\n410\n00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:42.300\nThere's also something in any of your\nOffice products in Windows called Icons.\n\n411\n00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.530\nLike I said, it's up at the top where\nyou could actually insert an icon.\n\n412\n00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:51.482\nAnd it's almost like, well, they're\nalmost like emojis, but they're not.\n\n413\n00:22:51.482 --> 00:22:55.160\nThey're like little pieces, and they kind\nof look like a bunny, if you want to say.\n\n414\n00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:59.099\nSo it has a piece of paper or\nwhat have you, and\n\n415\n00:22:59.099 --> 00:23:02.800\nthe icons are treated as special shapes.\n\n416\n00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.020\nThat's right, there you go,\nthat's what I was trying to say.\n\n417\n00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:07.780\nIt's a shape that looks like a bunny, or\na shape that looks like a computer screen,\n\n418\n00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:09.430\nor something like that.\n\n419\n00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:12.850\nIcons don't exist in Office for Mac.\n\n420\n00:23:14.154 --> 00:23:15.270\nThey're kinda cool, but\n\n421\n00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:19.320\nunfortunately Mac always gets kind of the\nshort end of the stick in what it can and\n\n422\n00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:23.520\ncan't support, and so, in case you're\nlooking for it, they don't exist.\n\n423\n00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:29.660\nAnd I did include icons in this\nparticular episode in the PC show,\n\n424\n00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:34.780\nso in case you're watching both cuz you\njust wanna get all the versions of Excel,\n\n425\n00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:36.640\nthat's what's missing.\n\n426\n00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:41.630\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne that is some, I well tell\nyou, the Selection Pane, believe it or\n\n427\n00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:45.180\nnot the explanation on that actually\nhelped me think about layers and\n\n428\n00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:47.150\nsome of these other\nthings a little better.\n\n429\n00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:50.290\nI was like, I gotta go do that.\n\n430\n00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:53.270\nSo I'm feeling a little creative,\nand after this episode,\n\n431\n00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:54.400\nyou probably do as well, so\n\n432\n00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:59.830\ngo draw something in Excel and, well,\ntry to hide some of those bad reports.\n\n433\n00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:03.620\nBut we're gonna go ahead and get out of\nhere because, well, we are done, right?\n\n434\n00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.480\nSo signing off for OfficePro.TV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n435\n00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.350\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n436\n00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:09.128\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time\n\n437\n00:24:09.128 --> 00:24:14.288\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

It's going good, you went out\nof sequence, you're like, wait,\n\n10\n00:00:32.433 --> 00:00:33.201\nI don't know what I'm doing.\n\n11\n00:00:33.201 --> 00:00:34.655\n&gt;&gt; I did, I did, I threw myself off.\n\n12\n00:00:34.655 --> 00:00:36.001\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It was all that\n\n13\n00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:37.139\ncommunist talk in the last episode.\n\n14\n00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:38.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n15\n00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.582\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] If you're like,\n\n16\n00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:43.129\nwhat were you guys talking about?\n\n17\n00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.908\n[LAUGH] I had a cat named Sasha.\n\n18\n00:00:46.908 --> 00:00:49.086\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh, where's it from?\n\n19\n00:00:49.086 --> 00:00:50.615\n&gt;&gt; And I said, [LAUGH],\nhe's a Russian Blue [LAUGH].\n\n20\n00:00:50.615 --> 00:00:52.270\n&gt;&gt; That you got in Havana, [LAUGH].\n\n21\n00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.394\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so as you can tell,\n\n22\n00:00:54.394 --> 00:00:58.429\nwe don't film these exactly in\norder every time so, [LAUGH].\n\n23\n00:00:58.429 --> 00:00:59.858\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n24\n00:00:59.858 --> 00:01:02.384\nyes, we went from remove\nduplicates to SmartArt [LAUGH].\n\n25\n00:01:02.384 --> 00:01:04.210\n&gt;&gt; Weird, but hey, [LAUGH].\n\n26\n00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.819\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what we do here,\nwe have a little bit of fun.\n\n27\n00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:09.013\n&gt;&gt; In the land of freedom,\nyou can do whatever you want like that.\n\n28\n00:01:09.013 --> 00:01:11.673\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We need to shut you down, okay?\n\n29\n00:01:11.673 --> 00:01:13.630\n[LAUGH] Just concentrate on Excel.\n\n30\n00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:14.752\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n31\n00:01:14.752 --> 00:01:19.598\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So SmartArt, we had to remove\nduplicates, if you're talking about,\n\n32\n00:01:19.598 --> 00:01:21.545\nhey, I've seen this before.\n\n33\n00:01:21.545 --> 00:01:24.551\nYeah, because SmartArt\nlives in every product.\n\n34\n00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:28.116\nSo you can do this in PowerPoint,\nin Word, in Excel,\n\n35\n00:01:28.116 --> 00:01:31.066\nI think you can even do it in Outlook,\nokay?\n\n36\n00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:34.441\nSo, I feel like I've taught this\nstuff 1,000 times, [LAUGH].\n\n37\n00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:35.253\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH].\n\n38\n00:01:35.253 --> 00:01:38.265\n&gt;&gt; But hey,\nit might be brand new to you, and\n\n39\n00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:43.021\nthat's why I put it in every single\nproduct that we do, because.\n\n40\n00:01:43.021 --> 00:01:45.432\n&gt;&gt; Because it's in every\nsingle product we use.\n\n41\n00:01:45.432 --> 00:01:48.454\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and it's always part\nof like the graphical element.\n\n42\n00:01:48.454 --> 00:01:51.148\n&gt;&gt; Well, the good news is, if you've\nseen any of the other episodes for\n\n43\n00:01:51.148 --> 00:01:52.224\nany of the other products.\n\n44\n00:01:52.224 --> 00:01:53.034\nThat have SmartArt in them,\n\n45\n00:01:53.034 --> 00:01:54.596\nyou're probably going to\nbe very familiar with this.\n\n46\n00:01:54.596 --> 00:01:57.035\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, and\nyou might learn something new.\n\n47\n00:01:57.035 --> 00:01:59.883\nAnd maybe you're just here for the good\nold Vonne and Daniel show, [LAUGH].\n\n48\n00:01:59.883 --> 00:02:04.244\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm going to stop right there,\n[LAUGH].\n\n49\n00:02:04.244 --> 00:02:08.060\n&gt;&gt; Yes, okay, so, [LAUGH],\nwhat is SmartArt?\n\n50\n00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.010\n&gt;&gt; It has a high IQ.\n\n51\n00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:14.763\n&gt;&gt; It's art that's smart,\nI think I make that joke every time, too.\n\n52\n00:02:14.763 --> 00:02:19.547\nSo it is just a graphical\nrepresentation of data.\n\n53\n00:02:19.547 --> 00:02:25.377\nAnd it just kind of gives\nyou a little more pizzaz for\n\n54\n00:02:25.377 --> 00:02:31.165\nmaybe a list or a procedure or\nmaybe a flow chart.\n\n55\n00:02:31.165 --> 00:02:33.597\nThe orb charts,\nthat's what I was trying to get to.\n\n56\n00:02:33.597 --> 00:02:36.181\nThis used to be insert charts and\ndiagrams, and\n\n57\n00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:40.393\nthe diagrams had the organizational\ncharts and some other things like that.\n\n58\n00:02:40.393 --> 00:02:44.800\nWell, it's just grown up over the years,\nand they made SmartArt, okay?\n\n59\n00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.938\nSo that's what we're going to be going\nover, and you're like, but this is Excel.\n\n60\n00:02:47.938 --> 00:02:50.519\nBut yeah,\nExcel talks about your numbers, and\n\n61\n00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.946\nyou might want to be able to have a nice,\nquick little graphic.\n\n62\n00:02:53.946 --> 00:02:57.365\nThat might illustrate your\npoint a little bit better so\n\n63\n00:02:57.365 --> 00:02:59.898\nthat's why we're going to be doing it.\n\n64\n00:02:59.898 --> 00:03:02.350\nAnd again, it's in Excel,\nso that's why, [LAUGH].\n\n65\n00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.517\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Leave no stone unturned,\nright, Vonne?\n\n66\n00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:09.139\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, it is a graphical element,\nand that's what it is, so let's do it.\n\n67\n00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:13.977\nI have a file,\nit's just a blank file, it's Book2,\n\n68\n00:03:13.977 --> 00:03:19.672\nI had another new file before him,\nwe're going to go to Insert.\n\n69\n00:03:19.672 --> 00:03:23.271\nAnd over here, it is part of our\nillustrations because we talked about\n\n70\n00:03:23.271 --> 00:03:24.979\ninserting pictures and shapes.\n\n71\n00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:31.156\nAnd now we get with SmartArt, so we have\nall sorts of categories that's SmartArt.\n\n72\n00:03:31.156 --> 00:03:36.054\nWe have Lists, we have Processes, and I\nthink you get the idea that sometimes you\n\n73\n00:03:36.054 --> 00:03:39.310\nneed to be talking about\na process rather than a list.\n\n74\n00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.751\nYou have Relationships and Hierarchies.\n\n75\n00:03:41.751 --> 00:03:46.702\nAnd the cool thing is that you get little\ngraphical representations of each one\n\n76\n00:03:46.702 --> 00:03:48.284\nof those off to the side.\n\n77\n00:03:48.284 --> 00:03:49.773\nAnd then you can pick one,\n\n78\n00:03:49.773 --> 00:03:53.723\nthis is where the gallery is slightly\ndifferent than the PC version.\n\n79\n00:03:53.723 --> 00:03:57.732\nThe PC version opens up in a window,\nit has a little bit more information,\n\n80\n00:03:57.732 --> 00:04:00.984\nit's a little bit more colorful,\nbut we get the idea here.\n\n81\n00:04:00.984 --> 00:04:03.677\nSo if I wanted to add some of our lists,\nlike, okay,\n\n82\n00:04:03.677 --> 00:04:06.143\nmaybe let's just start\nwith a super basic one.\n\n83\n00:04:06.143 --> 00:04:09.579\nWe'll start with our basic block list,\nokay, cool.\n\n84\n00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:15.231\nSo I just want to show the different\ncategories that are in our departments or\n\n85\n00:04:15.231 --> 00:04:18.161\nwhat have you, I don't know, [LAUGH].\n\n86\n00:04:18.161 --> 00:04:22.177\nSo I get that and let's just talk\nabout the super basics right now.\n\n87\n00:04:22.177 --> 00:04:26.338\nIt is inserted, one,\nit is not anywhere connected to a cell.\n\n88\n00:04:26.338 --> 00:04:30.547\nJust like all of our graphical elements,\nit's kind of floating on top,\n\n89\n00:04:30.547 --> 00:04:32.487\nif you want to say, that's one.\n\n90\n00:04:32.487 --> 00:04:36.712\nTwo is that we get some contextual tabs.\n\n91\n00:04:36.712 --> 00:04:38.383\nWhen we have contextual tabs,\n\n92\n00:04:38.383 --> 00:04:41.806\nwe know if we've added something\nin that was not there before.\n\n93\n00:04:41.806 --> 00:04:44.083\nJust like when we formatted as tables,\n\n94\n00:04:44.083 --> 00:04:48.778\nthe tables contextual tab came up when we\nput in pictures or shapes, same thing.\n\n95\n00:04:48.778 --> 00:04:53.707\nSo that's our stuff up here, we can\nnotice that we have our SmartArt Design\n\n96\n00:04:53.707 --> 00:04:56.690\nwhere we see things like layouts and\nstyles.\n\n97\n00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.502\nYeah, there we go again, and\nthen we have a Format tab, and\n\n98\n00:05:01.502 --> 00:05:06.239\nwe have our fills and\nour outlines and our word art styles.\n\n99\n00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:09.241\nOkay, well, this looks really familiar,\noops, sorry, I just collapsed it.\n\n100\n00:05:09.241 --> 00:05:12.780\nThis looks very familiar when we were\ndoing shapes, yeah, because you know what?\n\n101\n00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.186\nSmartArt is just a collection of shapes,\nthat's it, okay?\n\n102\n00:05:17.186 --> 00:05:22.653\nThat they went ahead and put together\na templated format to go ahead and\n\n103\n00:05:22.653 --> 00:05:26.740\nsay, this is easier for\nyou to go ahead and add text.\n\n104\n00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.454\nAnd act as one element,\nand it's a special group.\n\n105\n00:05:31.454 --> 00:05:35.548\nBecause we did talk about grouping\nin our arrange and align episode,\n\n106\n00:05:35.548 --> 00:05:38.808\nthat's when we were talking\nabout multiple objects.\n\n107\n00:05:38.808 --> 00:05:42.107\nSo it is grouped, but\nit's a fancy group, okay?\n\n108\n00:05:42.107 --> 00:05:47.382\nAnd it has some extra special\nthings that it can do.\n\n109\n00:05:47.382 --> 00:05:49.392\nSo if I wanted to add in the text,\n\n110\n00:05:49.392 --> 00:05:53.353\nbecause that's basically what\nwe're going to be doing here.\n\n111\n00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:57.467\nIs putting in some information\ninto this graphical element,\n\n112\n00:05:57.467 --> 00:05:59.772\nthere is a couple ways we can do it.\n\n113\n00:05:59.772 --> 00:06:04.673\nNotice over here that this is\nour text based way that I could\n\n114\n00:06:04.673 --> 00:06:09.288\nadd in the text, [LAUGH],\nin a list, I know it's like.\n\n115\n00:06:09.288 --> 00:06:11.962\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I love to watch Vonne\njust spiral out of control with her\n\n116\n00:06:11.962 --> 00:06:12.651\ndouble speak.\n\n117\n00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:16.153\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n118\n00:06:16.153 --> 00:06:17.400\n&gt;&gt; It's all the time, too,\n\n119\n00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.392\nbecause I start explaining, I'm like.\n\n120\n00:06:19.392 --> 00:06:21.907\n&gt;&gt; And then she's like,\nI'm making no sense to even me, [LAUGH].\n\n121\n00:06:21.907 --> 00:06:25.355\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's like,\nthere is nowhere else I can go besides.\n\n122\n00:06:25.355 --> 00:06:28.037\n&gt;&gt; We're going to get you a\nword-of-the-day calendar to increase your\n\n123\n00:06:28.037 --> 00:06:28.894\nvocabulary, [LAUGH].\n\n124\n00:06:28.894 --> 00:06:33.738\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Seriously, but\nthis is the Text pane of our SmartArt and\n\n125\n00:06:33.738 --> 00:06:35.613\nit's a different way.\n\n126\n00:06:35.613 --> 00:06:38.936\nAnd I know that this is our Text\npane because, one, I can see it.\n\n127\n00:06:38.936 --> 00:06:41.672\nTwo, there's a little button up here for\nText pane, and\n\n128\n00:06:41.672 --> 00:06:44.018\nthere's also this little\ntriangle right here.\n\n129\n00:06:44.018 --> 00:06:48.403\nSo if you don't see this, by any chance,\nif you click this little button,\n\n130\n00:06:48.403 --> 00:06:49.457\nit collapses in.\n\n131\n00:06:49.457 --> 00:06:52.863\nYou can click the button again,\nand it brings it back.\n\n132\n00:06:52.863 --> 00:06:56.182\nOr you can click on the button up here\non the ribbon to bring up the Text pane.\n\n133\n00:06:56.182 --> 00:07:00.889\nBecause your SmartArt is actually\na little bit more than just shapes,\n\n134\n00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:03.133\nit's really just a list, okay?\n\n135\n00:07:03.133 --> 00:07:07.827\nSo if I have a list of information,\neach bullet or\n\n136\n00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:14.593\nlevel of our list is going to display\nin some type of graphical format.\n\n137\n00:07:14.593 --> 00:07:18.200\nSo they do correlate together,\nit's not text just for text, [LAUGH].\n\n138\n00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.691\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is showing that in there, so\n\n139\n00:07:20.691 --> 00:07:23.261\nwhy don't I show you\nthe two different ways?\n\n140\n00:07:23.261 --> 00:07:27.775\nYou can, I can zoom in a little bit,\nand maybe zoom in here.\n\n141\n00:07:27.775 --> 00:07:32.749\nWe could say, whatever our\ndifferent departments we have,\n\n142\n00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:35.878\nlet's say we have marketing, okay?\n\n143\n00:07:35.878 --> 00:07:39.098\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not that.\n\n144\n00:07:39.098 --> 00:07:40.170\n&gt;&gt; Not there.\n\n145\n00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:41.100\n&gt;&gt; Marketing.\n\n146\n00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.650\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, I got it,\na few things that you notice.\n\n147\n00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:47.460\nThat as soon as I started typing\nmarketing, it started kind of bigger and\n\n148\n00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.715\nthen it automatically sized itself down.\n\n149\n00:07:49.715 --> 00:07:50.758\n&gt;&gt; So it scales?\n\n150\n00:07:50.758 --> 00:07:52.014\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, mm-hm.\n\n151\n00:07:52.014 --> 00:07:54.907\nAnd then,\nI'm using my down arrow on my keyboard.\n\n152\n00:07:54.907 --> 00:07:59.087\nBecause I want to get to the next bullet,\nI'm not hitting enter, because that's just\n\n153\n00:07:59.087 --> 00:08:02.831\ngoing to make a whole next one So I could\nsay we have marketing, we have sales.\n\n154\n00:08:02.831 --> 00:08:07.759\nOkay, let's hit Enter just to show you\nthat one thing that happened is I made\n\n155\n00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:11.517\nanother bullet line, but\nI also made another shape.\n\n156\n00:08:11.517 --> 00:08:12.370\nOkay, cool.\n\n157\n00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:16.921\nSo I can keep adding or\ndeleting the shapes that are representing\n\n158\n00:08:16.921 --> 00:08:21.480\nmy Smart Art by increasing\nthe amount of bullets or decreasing.\n\n159\n00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.320\nIf I hit the Delete key,\nthen it takes it away.\n\n160\n00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.884\nIf I put my cursor here, and\nthen hit the Delete key, now I have four.\n\n161\n00:08:28.884 --> 00:08:34.050\nSo you see how it's going to change based\non how many items I have in my list.\n\n162\n00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:38.377\nSo marketing sales, we have hosts,\n\n163\n00:08:38.377 --> 00:08:43.273\nand then we have what other departments?\n\n164\n00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:44.693\nCan't for cats.\n\n165\n00:08:44.693 --> 00:08:45.953\n&gt;&gt; Production.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n166\n00:08:45.953 --> 00:08:48.692\nI'm looking at-\n&gt;&gt; I thought you meant the ones in\n\n167\n00:08:48.692 --> 00:08:49.820\nthe Christmas cats.\n\n168\n00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:50.915\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n169\n00:08:50.915 --> 00:08:52.501\n&gt;&gt; You know, I flipped.\n\n170\n00:08:52.501 --> 00:08:54.327\nI went from Christmas cats to ITProTV.\n\n171\n00:08:54.327 --> 00:08:54.955\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So and\n\n172\n00:08:54.955 --> 00:08:57.775\nI point it out because Tanesia's\nvoice comes out right there.\n\n173\n00:08:57.775 --> 00:08:59.689\n&gt;&gt; She comes out of the sky.\n\n174\n00:08:59.689 --> 00:09:01.114\n&gt;&gt; She's like hello, hi.\n\n175\n00:09:01.114 --> 00:09:03.091\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now get to work!\n\n176\n00:09:03.091 --> 00:09:06.487\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; She does have to reign us in a little\n\n177\n00:09:06.487 --> 00:09:09.470\nbit, and so you can see there we go,\npretty cool.\n\n178\n00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:15.310\nNow since this is a list, if I wanted\nto put in, say we have with our hosts,\n\n179\n00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:20.588\nwe have SMES and regular hosts,\nactually we're all kind of both,\n\n180\n00:09:20.588 --> 00:09:26.933\nbut if I hit Enter and I hit the Tab key,\nnotice I'm making a multi-level list.\n\n181\n00:09:26.933 --> 00:09:29.954\nThe tab's here, we have our SME and\n\n182\n00:09:29.954 --> 00:09:34.480\nwe have our host, which is weird, because-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n183\n00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.232\n&gt;&gt; We're all, anyways.\n\n184\n00:09:35.232 --> 00:09:36.967\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Keep going, but\n\n185\n00:09:36.967 --> 00:09:42.330\nthis is a multi-level list, but\nthis particular layout of Smart Art\n\n186\n00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:47.338\nisn't necessarily the best for\nmulti-leveled lists, okay?\n\n187\n00:09:47.338 --> 00:09:51.083\nIf I went over to some other layouts, and\nthis is where we're gonna start saying,\n\n188\n00:09:51.083 --> 00:09:53.378\nokay, cool,\nwe've got some information here.\n\n189\n00:09:53.378 --> 00:09:56.047\nHow can I start modifying things?\n\n190\n00:09:56.047 --> 00:10:01.370\nYou can come up to your layouts and\nyou can pick some different ones.\n\n191\n00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:04.202\nSo for example, here I need it\njust close that out for a minute.\n\n192\n00:10:04.202 --> 00:10:07.838\nThis is where we're just\ndoing list information, okay?\n\n193\n00:10:07.838 --> 00:10:08.941\nThat looks a little better.\n\n194\n00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:11.425\nSo now you can see if I\nhad multi-level lists,\n\n195\n00:10:11.425 --> 00:10:14.869\nit might look better in this\nparticular layout versus doing some\n\n196\n00:10:14.869 --> 00:10:17.880\nof the other ones,\nwhere it's just like the hexagons.\n\n197\n00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.472\nThat doesn't even make\nany sense right there.\n\n198\n00:10:20.472 --> 00:10:25.356\nAnyways, different layouts\nwill work better for\n\n199\n00:10:25.356 --> 00:10:28.617\nsingle or multiple level lists.\n\n200\n00:10:28.617 --> 00:10:33.020\nAnd if I come back out to here, maybe I'll\ngo ahead and get rid of these two things.\n\n201\n00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:36.850\nI could also click a little minus button\nright here, so I can do pluses and\n\n202\n00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:37.850\nminuses this way.\n\n203\n00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:42.667\nCool, I'm going to close out\nof the Smart Art text pane,\n\n204\n00:10:42.667 --> 00:10:47.880\nbecause I could manipulate and\ndo everything from the shapes themselves.\n\n205\n00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:52.135\nJust like when we are adding text into\nregular shapes in the other episodes,\n\n206\n00:10:52.135 --> 00:10:54.406\nthat's really what we're doing here.\n\n207\n00:10:54.406 --> 00:10:56.411\nAnd something you need to watch for\n\n208\n00:10:56.411 --> 00:11:00.860\nwhen you're working with Smart Art\nis what am I selected on?\n\n209\n00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.607\nWhat's got the little dots around it?\n\n210\n00:11:03.607 --> 00:11:07.277\nAnd you see right now,\nthis guy, I have the host, or\n\n211\n00:11:07.277 --> 00:11:11.292\nthis particular shape,\nselected inside of all of them.\n\n212\n00:11:11.292 --> 00:11:14.583\nIf I come to the very edge\nof the outside and I click,\n\n213\n00:11:14.583 --> 00:11:17.160\nnow I have the whole Smart Art graphic.\n\n214\n00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.160\n&gt;&gt; So it becomes a unit instead\nof individual pieces of the unit?\n\n215\n00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.380\n&gt;&gt; Correct, and that makes a big\ndifference for one, moving things.\n\n216\n00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:29.922\nIf I wanna move this whole Smart Art, go\nto the edge, the outside edge of the whole\n\n217\n00:11:29.922 --> 00:11:35.381\nthing to move this, cuz if I had clicked\nhere, this is the guy that selected it,\n\n218\n00:11:35.381 --> 00:11:39.480\nand I start moving this,\nnow I'm just moving that one guy.\n\n219\n00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.619\nI can't really move very much outside,\nbut do you see how, no,\n\n220\n00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:44.098\nthat's not what I wanted to do.\n\n221\n00:11:44.098 --> 00:11:48.310\nI wanted to grab the whole thing and\nmove the whole Smart Art.\n\n222\n00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:50.450\nSo just be careful about that.\n\n223\n00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:54.236\nAnd the other thing would come into\nwhether you're doing formatting or not.\n\n224\n00:11:54.236 --> 00:11:58.096\nIf I have all of them selected,\nand I come to Format, and\n\n225\n00:11:58.096 --> 00:12:02.080\nI change the Shape Fill,\nnotice what I just filled in.\n\n226\n00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.961\nI didn't fill in each one of the squares.\n\n227\n00:12:03.961 --> 00:12:06.825\nI filled in like the square\nthat the squares lived in.\n\n228\n00:12:06.825 --> 00:12:07.953\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n229\n00:12:07.953 --> 00:12:08.670\n&gt;&gt; That's kind of funny.\n\n230\n00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:09.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n231\n00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:14.610\nnow [LAUGH] I want that one square to\nbe changed, then I can change the fill.\n\n232\n00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:15.449\nOkay, cool.\n\n233\n00:12:15.449 --> 00:12:18.809\nThis also brings me back along to,\nokay, yes,\n\n234\n00:12:18.809 --> 00:12:22.790\nyou can totally format\neach individual shape.\n\n235\n00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:26.060\nI could select this one and\nchange its color.\n\n236\n00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:26.890\nOkay, that's great!\n\n237\n00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:32.800\nSmart Art, honestly,\nis easiest if you just use\n\n238\n00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:38.670\nthe styles and the overall\nformatting that is available to you.\n\n239\n00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:43.775\nYou can customize it till the cows come\nhome, so all that stuff that we did\n\n240\n00:12:43.775 --> 00:12:49.813\nin our shapes episode, everything applies\nhere as well, cuz they're just shapes.\n\n241\n00:12:49.813 --> 00:12:50.394\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Nice.\n\n242\n00:12:50.394 --> 00:12:54.279\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's all they are, so\nif I go back over Smart Design,\n\n243\n00:12:54.279 --> 00:12:56.167\nit's these guys right here.\n\n244\n00:12:56.167 --> 00:13:01.925\nI can come into, well, let's go ahead and\nmaybe format them with a little bit of,\n\n245\n00:13:01.925 --> 00:13:05.530\nwe have a bevel emboss and\nthen change the colors.\n\n246\n00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:06.775\nI'll use my colors here.\n\n247\n00:13:06.775 --> 00:13:08.380\nOkay, you know what, to me, boom.\n\n248\n00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.660\nThat looks perfect, right.\n\n249\n00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.800\nSometimes less is more.\n\n250\n00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.590\nSimple is better.\n\n251\n00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:19.500\nJust use what they have, to me, I feel\nwith the colors and some of the themes,\n\n252\n00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:23.770\nand maybe go ahead and select all of them.\n\n253\n00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:25.322\nNotice I went to the outside.\n\n254\n00:13:25.322 --> 00:13:30.271\nAnd maybe apply black text instead of\nwhite text, or something to that effect.\n\n255\n00:13:30.271 --> 00:13:31.790\nTo me, I would stop there.\n\n256\n00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:36.259\nTo me, that looks good enough for\nwhat I want it to achieve, okay.\n\n257\n00:13:36.259 --> 00:13:40.427\nBut if I start getting a little weird and\nselect this guy, and then hey,\n\n258\n00:13:40.427 --> 00:13:45.360\nI'll do one 3D rotation for this guy, and\nthen this one, I'll come over and change\n\n259\n00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.698\nits shape to a heart and all this kind of-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n260\n00:13:48.698 --> 00:13:49.223\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n261\n00:13:49.223 --> 00:13:54.480\nnow it's kind of defeating the whole\npurpose of what makes Smart Art so cool.\n\n262\n00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.947\nIt's just-\n&gt;&gt; Now, it just looks like a hot mess,\n\n263\n00:13:56.947 --> 00:13:57.680\nas they say.\n\n264\n00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:02.068\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, this is just,\njust use the default and go on.\n\n265\n00:14:02.068 --> 00:14:05.323\nBut if you get a little crazy over here,\n\n266\n00:14:05.323 --> 00:14:10.360\nthe cool thing is you have\nan option to reset the graphic.\n\n267\n00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:15.739\nWhen I moved it too much or I resized it,\nif I reset it, it takes it back to\n\n268\n00:14:15.739 --> 00:14:20.968\nits normal templated way that this\nparticular layout started with.\n\n269\n00:14:20.968 --> 00:14:21.800\nSo that's kinda cool.\n\n270\n00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.460\nSo if you went and made this smaller and\n\n271\n00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:28.420\nnotice how it also resized\nall of your text everywhere.\n\n272\n00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:32.070\nJust reset it back to the default,\nput on a style.\n\n273\n00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:36.300\nI usually choose like this one,\nand I use a colorful one.\n\n274\n00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:41.785\nBy the way, these colors are pulling from,\nI was gonna say,\n\n275\n00:14:41.785 --> 00:14:43.813\nwhat do you think, Daniel?\n\n276\n00:14:43.813 --> 00:14:44.879\n&gt;&gt; Pulling rom the computer?\n\n277\n00:14:44.879 --> 00:14:48.482\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The theme.\n\n278\n00:14:48.482 --> 00:14:49.036\n&gt;&gt; The theme.\n\n279\n00:14:49.036 --> 00:14:49.536\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Theme.\n\n280\n00:14:49.536 --> 00:14:50.721\n&gt;&gt; The theme.\n\n281\n00:14:50.721 --> 00:14:51.674\n&gt;&gt; It was on the tip of my tongue.\n\n282\n00:14:51.674 --> 00:14:52.825\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n283\n00:14:52.825 --> 00:14:55.025\n&gt;&gt; You just beat me to it.\n\n284\n00:14:55.025 --> 00:14:57.240\n&gt;&gt; So, whatever theme you have going on\n\n285\n00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:02.113\nin your document, that's what colors\nare going to be pulling in your Smart Art.\n\n286\n00:15:02.113 --> 00:15:03.609\nSo now you can see that the colors\n\n287\n00:15:03.609 --> 00:15:06.171\nwill change because I have\na different theme going on.\n\n288\n00:15:06.171 --> 00:15:07.712\nAll right, pretty cool, and\n\n289\n00:15:07.712 --> 00:15:11.042\nthat's what you got.\nSo individual pieces versus\n\n290\n00:15:11.042 --> 00:15:15.974\nthe whole thing, adding shapes or\nadding text to your shapes, so\n\n291\n00:15:15.974 --> 00:15:21.640\nI did it basically through\nthe Smart Art Text pane, which is fine.\n\n292\n00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:25.794\nLet's just do a few other quick examples,\njust to point out just a couple little\n\n293\n00:15:25.794 --> 00:15:28.218\nthings on some of the other\ntypes of Smart Art.\n\n294\n00:15:28.218 --> 00:15:35.095\nFor example, if I go to Insert &gt; Process,\nI need to show, you know what?\n\n295\n00:15:35.095 --> 00:15:36.110\nActually I do the cycle.\n\n296\n00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:37.450\nThat's the one I always choose.\n\n297\n00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:41.010\nIf I choose a cycle,\ninstead of using the text pane,\n\n298\n00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:43.630\nmaybe I wanna do the cycles of the cats.\n\n299\n00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:46.930\nYes, what do they do every day?\n\n300\n00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:49.998\nThey go ahead and eat.\n\n301\n00:15:49.998 --> 00:15:54.848\nSo notice I'm going right into the shapes\nthis time, where it says text,\n\n302\n00:15:54.848 --> 00:15:58.541\nand I've got an idea, and\nif I click, then they sleep.\n\n303\n00:15:58.541 --> 00:16:00.011\nNotice all the text changes.\n\n304\n00:16:00.011 --> 00:16:05.028\nAnd then they meow, and\nthen they sleep again?\n\n305\n00:16:05.028 --> 00:16:08.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They play, there we go,\n\n306\n00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:11.060\nthey'll play and\nthen they eat again, they sleep.\n\n307\n00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:14.920\nSo I don't really need this last shape,\n\n308\n00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:18.900\nI only need to have four,\nsorry guys, four here.\n\n309\n00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:21.180\nSo I'm not gonna get my I-beam in there,\n\n310\n00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.220\nbecause I-beam means\nI'm gonna start typing.\n\n311\n00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:26.555\nIf I go to the four pointed arrow and\nselect the whole shape,\n\n312\n00:16:26.555 --> 00:16:30.106\njust hit the Delete key on the keyboard,\nit deletes the shape.\n\n313\n00:16:30.106 --> 00:16:32.414\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; But then it readjusts, okay, cool,\n\n314\n00:16:32.414 --> 00:16:33.990\nI like that.\n\n315\n00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:39.130\nAnd then I can apply a different style,\nchange some colors in here, all right.\n\n316\n00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:44.970\nSo again, right there, boom, perfect\ndiagram that I need to go ahead and do.\n\n317\n00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:47.850\nMaybe I want the cycle\nto go a different way.\n\n318\n00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:53.208\nSo different layouts have some different\noptions that you have up here in the top.\n\n319\n00:16:53.208 --> 00:16:57.610\nYou have a right to left,\nnotice that the arrows go the other way.\n\n320\n00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:01.160\nYou can turn that left or\nright, and so on and so forth.\n\n321\n00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:04.550\nI can add another shape, right,\nmaybe I need a fifth shape.\n\n322\n00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:07.870\nYou click Add Shape, and\nthere's your next one,\n\n323\n00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:09.910\nyou want another one, you hit it again.\n\n324\n00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:14.760\nOkay, so you can use\nthe Add Shape button or the list.\n\n325\n00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.100\nEither way, so I've shown you kind\nof both ways you want to do it.\n\n326\n00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:20.720\nSome maybe if it's very text intensive,\nyou might wanna use this.\n\n327\n00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:24.280\nOr maybe you're used to just working\nwith lists period, go ahead and do that.\n\n328\n00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:28.250\nIf you're more of a shapey type person,\ngo ahead and\n\n329\n00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:30.540\ntype right in the shapes, you're fine.\n\n330\n00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.770\nSo that's one with the cycle diagrams.\n\n331\n00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:36.720\nThe last one I wanted to just kind of\npoint a few little things out would be\n\n332\n00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.820\nthe hierarchy.\n\n333\n00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.690\nNow a hierarchy, this is an org chart.\n\n334\n00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:45.460\nCool, so I have who's at the top,\nwho's underneath it, right?\n\n335\n00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:50.160\nSo in that way, you're going to\nhave a couple other buttons.\n\n336\n00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:55.490\nYou're going to have, when you add shapes,\ndo you want to add a shape before,\n\n337\n00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:57.630\nabove, below, add an assistant.\n\n338\n00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:02.276\nSo we have some different\noptions in this particular one.\n\n339\n00:18:02.276 --> 00:18:04.969\nAnd I don't to have to\ntype in the names or\n\n340\n00:18:04.969 --> 00:18:07.992\nanybody, so\nthese are all in the same level.\n\n341\n00:18:07.992 --> 00:18:12.174\nSo you can almost think of like,\nthis is the CEO or\n\n342\n00:18:12.174 --> 00:18:17.478\nthe owner of the company, and\nthen these are all of your vice,\n\n343\n00:18:17.478 --> 00:18:22.581\nwait, I almost said principals,\nvice presidents, wow.\n\n344\n00:18:22.581 --> 00:18:23.295\n&gt;&gt; Let's call them VPs.\n\n345\n00:18:23.295 --> 00:18:26.084\n&gt;&gt; VPs, yes,\nI'm trying to get my lingo and\n\n346\n00:18:26.084 --> 00:18:29.447\nall I can think of is the vice principal,\nso okay.\n\n347\n00:18:29.447 --> 00:18:33.415\n&gt;&gt; We have those,\ntoo [LAUGH] it's a real thing.\n\n348\n00:18:33.415 --> 00:18:36.421\n&gt;&gt; They are, if we were talking\nabout a school, you might.\n\n349\n00:18:36.421 --> 00:18:38.464\n&gt;&gt; See,\nan organizational chart's good there too.\n\n350\n00:18:38.464 --> 00:18:44.553\n&gt;&gt; Hey, there you go, [LAUGH] so\ndepending on which shape you are at,\n\n351\n00:18:44.553 --> 00:18:50.560\nif I add a shape, do I want it after or\nbefore, or above or below?\n\n352\n00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:55.720\nIf I was saying, okay,\nhere's the VP of sales, and then you have\n\n353\n00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:01.000\nother people under that, like junior\nsales executives, and so on and so forth.\n\n354\n00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.550\nYou need to make sure, one, you pick the\nshape that you want to add subordinates,\n\n355\n00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:08.090\nif you wanna say, or\npeople below or above.\n\n356\n00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:11.870\nSo if I click add shape below,\nthen it adds the shape below.\n\n357\n00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:17.350\nOn this shape, notice this is the one\nhighlighted, if I then add a shape below,\n\n358\n00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:24.190\nyou see how now it's breaking off\nthat this is underneath this person.\n\n359\n00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:27.330\nSo you have to be careful about\nyour levels, like wait, no, no,\n\n360\n00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:30.430\nno, I actually wanted them\nto all be off the same line.\n\n361\n00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:34.480\nOkay, so I can take this person and\npromote them,\n\n362\n00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.940\nand notice how the lines have changed.\n\n363\n00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:41.630\nMaybe this person that was off of\nthe VP of sales, he got promoted and\n\n364\n00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:45.570\nhe's not the junior sales executive,\n\n365\n00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:49.640\nhe's the VP of production,\nor what have you.\n\n366\n00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.770\nSo if I promote that person,\nthen it goes all the way up.\n\n367\n00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:55.783\nThere's some weird rendering\nthat happens here,\n\n368\n00:19:55.783 --> 00:19:58.736\nstuff that kind of sticks around,\nthat's fine.\n\n369\n00:19:58.736 --> 00:20:03.721\nBut just know that you need to be\ncareful about what box you're on, and\n\n370\n00:20:03.721 --> 00:20:09.690\nwhether you want to add it on the same\nlevel, that would be after or before.\n\n371\n00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:13.840\nVersus taking and\nadding the shape below, and\n\n372\n00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:19.100\nthen making a separate level\nof your organization, okay.\n\n373\n00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:23.799\nSo on this one,\nI would then add after, and so\n\n374\n00:20:23.799 --> 00:20:27.402\nnow it's going down, add after.\n\n375\n00:20:27.402 --> 00:20:32.810\nIf this person then breaks off,\nthen I would add below.\n\n376\n00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:34.320\nAnd so now you can see how, and\n\n377\n00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:40.680\nit also starts changing how it lays out\ndepending on how many levels you go down.\n\n378\n00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:47.162\nIf you need some super fancy org charts,\nSmartArts would be good.\n\n379\n00:20:47.162 --> 00:20:50.980\nI'm sure there's dedicated software,\nthird party [SOUND].\n\n380\n00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:52.064\n&gt;&gt; Third party software?\n\n381\n00:20:52.064 --> 00:20:55.448\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, [LAUGH] now we'll go to-\n&gt;&gt; I speak for her sometimes [LAUGH].\n\n382\n00:20:55.448 --> 00:20:57.130\n&gt;&gt; That will give you way more options.\n\n383\n00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:59.580\nCuz I mean, I've seen some org charts,\nit is just-\n\n384\n00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:03.122\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're quite ridiculous.\n\n385\n00:21:03.122 --> 00:21:06.790\n&gt;&gt; So just depends on the size\nof your organization.\n\n386\n00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:09.275\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, makes my phishing\nscams really hard to pull off.\n\n387\n00:21:09.275 --> 00:21:12.152\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Who am I attacking here,\n\n388\n00:21:12.152 --> 00:21:13.900\n[LAUGH] it's a joke.\n\n389\n00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:14.785\n&gt;&gt; He doesn't do that.\n\n390\n00:21:14.785 --> 00:21:18.389\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I mean, you are preparing for\n\n391\n00:21:18.389 --> 00:21:21.510\nall sort of crazy hacky like shows, so.\n\n392\n00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:25.043\nThere's me and my tech, those hacky shows.\n\n393\n00:21:25.043 --> 00:21:27.505\n&gt;&gt; That one is okay, you hack stuff.\n\n394\n00:21:27.505 --> 00:21:31.852\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Goodness,\nokay, so one last thing,\n\n395\n00:21:31.852 --> 00:21:37.325\nif I go ahead and do a shape after,\nso now it's going down.\n\n396\n00:21:37.325 --> 00:21:41.132\nNotice how it is hanging off\nof this particular level\n\n397\n00:21:41.132 --> 00:21:44.194\na specific way,\n&gt;&gt; If I wanted to flip this to\n\n398\n00:21:44.194 --> 00:21:48.077\nthe other side, I don't like\nthat they're going to the right.\n\n399\n00:21:48.077 --> 00:21:51.823\nYou have to take the top level, so\nall of these that are coming off of them.\n\n400\n00:21:51.823 --> 00:21:57.915\nIf I select this shape right here, notice\nI can choose what way they hang off,\n\n401\n00:21:57.915 --> 00:22:02.710\nI can do a left hanging, and\nthen see how the line flips over.\n\n402\n00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:06.850\nSo if you need to switch\nwhere your lines come off of,\n\n403\n00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:10.540\ngo to the top level, go up to layouts,\nand then you can change it around.\n\n404\n00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:14.880\nAnd then again, I'll choose like\na colorful level and go on so\n\n405\n00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:15.810\nforth like that.\n\n406\n00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:19.173\nMaybe add a little bit of style on it,\nput some little drop shadows or\n\n407\n00:22:19.173 --> 00:22:21.011\nat least some bevel and emboss on it.\n\n408\n00:22:21.011 --> 00:22:24.580\nI think that always makes everything stand\nout a little bit better, and there you go.\n\n409\n00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:28.610\nYeah, I didn't fill in the text, but\nagain, you could do that along the way,\n\n410\n00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:31.900\nor use your text pane.\n\n411\n00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:36.110\nSee, it's just a list as well, so\neverything is in list format, and\n\n412\n00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:38.350\nthen you can change your shapes.\n\n413\n00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:43.568\nOne last thing I'd like to point out is,\nlet's go back to a simple one.\n\n414\n00:22:43.568 --> 00:22:48.900\nSo let's go back to this one, so I said\nthat this was a special group, right?\n\n415\n00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:53.530\nIt wasnt just regular shapes\nall grouped and normal group.\n\n416\n00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:55.960\nAnd that's why it gives us\nthese different particular\n\n417\n00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.440\ncontextual tabs of changing stuff.\n\n418\n00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:02.510\nBut there are some times like hey,\nmaybe this one, okay.\n\n419\n00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:06.543\nI really want those\nlittle arrows out of it,\n\n420\n00:23:06.543 --> 00:23:11.235\nI want this to stop acting\nlike a SmartArt graphic.\n\n421\n00:23:11.235 --> 00:23:15.650\nThis was especially in, sometimes if\nyou wanna animate this in PowerPoint.\n\n422\n00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:19.310\nI want specific places or\nI wanna do something individually and\n\n423\n00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:22.360\nmove it more than just\nit being in SmartArt.\n\n424\n00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:25.160\nThere's ways you can just\nconvert it to shapes.\n\n425\n00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:30.330\nSo not be a special group,\ndon't be a smart or be a SmartArt.\n\n426\n00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:35.280\nJust be a group collection\nof regular shapes.\n\n427\n00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:39.685\nAnd I'll click on that, notice\nthere's no SmartArt tab up here, yes,\n\n428\n00:23:39.685 --> 00:23:43.490\nthere's a shape format,\nbecause now it's just a grouped shape.\n\n429\n00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:47.410\nSo if I took this and then,\nlet's go over here actually.\n\n430\n00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:51.076\nLet's, come here, let's click on this,\nthis is the group.\n\n431\n00:23:51.076 --> 00:23:55.404\nI come over here to the Shape format,\nI go over to Arrange and\n\n432\n00:23:55.404 --> 00:23:58.180\ngo to Group and go to Ungroup.\n\n433\n00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:00.110\nAnd now, lots of little dots in here, but\n\n434\n00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:04.910\nnow you can see that this\nis separate than this.\n\n435\n00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:08.600\nI just made that bigger,\nfour point arrows, there it is, okay, and\n\n436\n00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:09.440\nso on and so forth.\n\n437\n00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:12.480\nAnd yes, I could make this bigger and\ngo along the way.\n\n438\n00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:16.930\nBut now they're just normal shapes,\nnothing fancy or special about them.\n\n439\n00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:19.500\nAnd then you could do whatever\nyou need to do with them.\n\n440\n00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:24.050\nCuz maybe you really just wanted\nthat one Arrow out of it and\n\n441\n00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:25.768\nmove them however you want to go.\n\n442\n00:24:25.768 --> 00:24:28.880\nThat is SmartArt, art that is smart, and\n\n443\n00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:31.220\nyou can use it in all of\nyour Office products.\n\n444\n00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:35.510\n&gt;&gt; Well, it does add a little pizzazz,\na little flair to all of our spreadsheets,\n\n445\n00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:36.165\nthat's for sure.\n\n446\n00:24:36.165 --> 00:24:38.933\nCuz it could take the mundane and\nmake it a little more exciting for us.\n\n447\n00:24:38.933 --> 00:24:42.349\nEspecially when you're sitting\nthrough very long presentations, and\n\n448\n00:24:42.349 --> 00:24:44.130\nhelp move those things along.\n\n449\n00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:46.990\nDon't discount the ability for\nit to be able to do that.\n\n450\n00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:50.662\nIt really will make you go, well, at least\nthis is an interesting thing to look at\n\n451\n00:24:50.662 --> 00:24:53.042\nand not something,\njust random text on the screen.\n\n452\n00:24:53.042 --> 00:24:55.740\nSo play with SmartArt,\nmake cool stuff, and\n\n453\n00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:58.830\nmake your presentations\npop that much harder.\n\n454\n00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:00.760\nVonne, thanks so much for\nshowing us how we can use SmartArt.\n\n455\n00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:03.095\nLike the 1000th time on\nthe 1000th product, but\n\n456\n00:25:03.095 --> 00:25:05.730\nit's always cool every time and\nit's always a good refresher.\n\n457\n00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:08.824\nSo if you've seen this before,\ngreat stuff, if it's your first time,\n\n458\n00:25:08.824 --> 00:25:10.865\nit's also awesome, so\njust go play with that.\n\n459\n00:25:10.865 --> 00:25:13.470\nAs for the show, though, we're gonna\ncall it a day, thanks for watching.\n\n460\n00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:15.622\nSigning off for Office Pro TV I've\nbeen your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n461\n00:25:15.622 --> 00:25:16.580\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n462\n00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:18.587\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time\n\n463\n00:25:18.587 --> 00:25:21.899\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

OfficeProTv,\n\n3\n00:00:15.461 --> 00:00:16.786\nI'm your host Justin Dennison.\n\n4\n00:00:16.786 --> 00:00:18.305\nWell, you've ask for it and so\n\n5\n00:00:18.305 --> 00:00:21.655\nwe're coming back at you with\nmore Excel 2016 Advance for Mac.\n\n6\n00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:24.663\nAnd well we're gonna be\nlooking at Shared Workbooks.\n\n7\n00:00:24.663 --> 00:00:28.081\nWorkbooks, yeah workbooks, I had to\nthink I always get those words mixed up.\n\n8\n00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:30.819\nBut luckily we have someone who is not\ngonna get them mixed up and take us\n\n9\n00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:34.129\nthrough the paces, the one and only Mrs.\nVonne Smith how are you doing today Vonne?\n\n10\n00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:35.656\nI'm doing great, I always mix them up.\n\n11\n00:00:35.656 --> 00:00:38.381\n[LAUGH] Man,\nyou're not supposed to tell anybody.\n\n12\n00:00:38.381 --> 00:00:41.392\nI know, but tell everybody like\nI just always screw these up.\n\n13\n00:00:41.392 --> 00:00:45.495\n[LAUGH] It is, right at work, and work,\nand you're like, I remember the work part,\n\n14\n00:00:45.495 --> 00:00:47.870\nbut is it a book, or\na sheet, or I don't know.\n\n15\n00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.150\nDid I come to work today, who knows?\n\n16\n00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.850\n[LAUGH] Where am I, what's my name?\n\n17\n00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.505\nYeah, it is Monday for us but\nyou all don't really know that,\n\n18\n00:00:53.505 --> 00:00:55.103\nbecause you just watch it whenever.\n\n19\n00:00:55.103 --> 00:00:59.520\nBut yes,\nwe are gonna talk about shared workbooks.\n\n20\n00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.650\nNow this is, to me, gonna be\nan interesting episode, because recently\n\n21\n00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.611\nat the time of this recording,\nwhich is, we are in April of 2018,\n\n22\n00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:14.850\nthe support files that you have on\nMicrosoft Help dot com and everything.\n\n23\n00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.817\nThey've put a new little\naddendum to the page which,\n\n24\n00:01:18.817 --> 00:01:24.372\nI can almost guarantee the last time\nI taught, or recorded this particular\n\n25\n00:01:24.372 --> 00:01:30.366\nepisode in the PC version They didn't have\nthat, so there has been another shift\n\n26\n00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:35.418\nin the Microsoft Office world that\nthey're saying hey guess what?\n\n27\n00:01:35.418 --> 00:01:39.050\nShared workbooks,\nthat's going to be deprecated.\n\n28\n00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.995\nWe are going to not use that anymore.\n\n29\n00:01:41.995 --> 00:01:44.480\nThey're actually calling it legacy, now.\n\n30\n00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.523\nThey're saying this has been\nreplaced with coauthoring.\n\n31\n00:01:49.523 --> 00:01:52.756\nSo you shouldn't be doing\nshared workbooks anymore.\n\n32\n00:01:52.756 --> 00:01:58.790\nAnd I'm like okay, I hear you Microsoft,\nI know where you're going.\n\n33\n00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:59.624\nThe thing is,\n\n34\n00:01:59.624 --> 00:02:04.084\nthere's a whole bunch of people out\nthere that still use shared workbooks.\n\n35\n00:02:04.084 --> 00:02:08.530\nSo I think it's gonna take a little\nbit of a time to kinda shift off and\n\n36\n00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.960\nnot everybody updates all the time.\n\n37\n00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.383\nAnd yes, Office 365 in all its glory and\nthe subscription-based models.\n\n38\n00:02:14.383 --> 00:02:19.894\nAnd of course, the whole push towards\ncloud computing and what they can do now.\n\n39\n00:02:19.894 --> 00:02:23.494\nBut that is fantastic and I think it's\nwonderful how they've progressed.\n\n40\n00:02:23.494 --> 00:02:28.102\nBut there still gonna be plenty of people\nthat still work with shared workbooks,\n\n41\n00:02:28.102 --> 00:02:30.330\nso you need to understand them.\n\n42\n00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.613\nSo while Microsoft is deeming this as old,\nright now, I don't know,\n\n43\n00:02:34.613 --> 00:02:39.349\nI don't know if it's that old just yet,\nbut you know how they like to do that.\n\n44\n00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.816\nYeah, and\nthis is kind of the way of the future,\n\n45\n00:02:41.816 --> 00:02:44.223\ntechnology is gonna be\nchanging a great deal,\n\n46\n00:02:44.223 --> 00:02:48.570\nhowever you used a word that's actually\nused as verbage, a deprecation.\n\n47\n00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.063\nDeprecation can mean an indeterminate\ntime period based on some arbitrary\n\n48\n00:02:53.063 --> 00:02:57.285\ndecision about what versions\nare finally gonna remove the features.\n\n49\n00:02:57.285 --> 00:03:00.170\nSo, I think it's a worthwhile\nthing to still note.\n\n50\n00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.141\nNow, I'm not privy to any Microsoft\ndecisions, so I can't say.\n\n51\n00:03:04.141 --> 00:03:08.600\nMaybe their deprecation schedule is\nreally short or like it's deprecated.\n\n52\n00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.801\nNext release, it's out, that's a,\nwe're taking this away.\n\n53\n00:03:12.801 --> 00:03:17.763\nDeprecation typically means there's a lead\ntime in order to give people, as you said,\n\n54\n00:03:17.763 --> 00:03:19.860\ntime to transition away.\n\n55\n00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.414\nAll the while trying to push\npeople to say, you know what,\n\n56\n00:03:22.414 --> 00:03:24.147\nyou shouldn't be using this any more.\n\n57\n00:03:24.147 --> 00:03:27.160\nUse this new niffy because\nthis is deprecated.\n\n58\n00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.033\nSo do keep those things in mind,\nstill probably need to know,\n\n59\n00:03:30.033 --> 00:03:34.086\nbecause there might be legacy systems that\nyou encounter that still use this feature.\n\n60\n00:03:34.086 --> 00:03:37.568\nYeah, and I don't think that this\nis one of those ones that they\n\n61\n00:03:37.568 --> 00:03:40.670\ncan ever fully get rid of,\nI really don't think so.\n\n62\n00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.378\nBut I understand where they're going,\n\n63\n00:03:43.378 --> 00:03:47.213\nand why don't we talk about\nwhat have we been going with?\n\n64\n00:03:47.213 --> 00:03:49.620\nWhat is a shared workbook?\n\n65\n00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.463\nAnd this is where it starts to\nget a little convoluted and\n\n66\n00:03:52.463 --> 00:03:53.682\neverything like that.\n\n67\n00:03:53.682 --> 00:03:59.370\nWhy don't we come down to my computer,\njust so I have some visuals to go with.\n\n68\n00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.920\nSo I brought up some web pages\nthat are in the episode notes.\n\n69\n00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.553\nSo let's talk about\nshared workbook feature.\n\n70\n00:04:07.553 --> 00:04:08.858\nAnd right here,\n\n71\n00:04:08.858 --> 00:04:14.500\nthis is the new little blurb on top\nthat I know was not here the last time.\n\n72\n00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.581\nSo, it's basis,\nit's an older feature that allows you to\n\n73\n00:04:17.581 --> 00:04:21.663\ncollaborate on a workbook with multiple\npeople, that's what it's saying.\n\n74\n00:04:21.663 --> 00:04:24.799\nIt does have a lot of limitations and\nthat is true,\n\n75\n00:04:24.799 --> 00:04:29.440\nthat's always been the case when\nwe're working with shared workbooks.\n\n76\n00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.915\nBut the idea is that you would\nbe able to collaborate on\n\n77\n00:04:33.915 --> 00:04:36.607\nthe same with multiple people.\n\n78\n00:04:36.607 --> 00:04:40.313\nBut there's this kinda weird caveat\nabout it, it's you'd still have to, and\n\n79\n00:04:40.313 --> 00:04:41.690\nwe're talking about.\n\n80\n00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.415\nAgain, we're talking old school in the\nsense cloud computing didn't really exist.\n\n81\n00:04:46.415 --> 00:04:51.050\nWe didn't really have OneDrives and\nall the Dropboxes, and Google Drives.\n\n82\n00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.683\nAnd all these kind of shared cloud storage\nplaces that's become I think pretty common\n\n83\n00:04:55.683 --> 00:04:59.234\nplace now-a-days, but\nyou did have networks drives, right.\n\n84\n00:04:59.234 --> 00:05:02.995\nIf you worked in a large organization,\nyou were all on the network together, so\n\n85\n00:05:02.995 --> 00:05:04.860\nyou could save it up to the share drive.\n\n86\n00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.676\nAnd maybe it's the U drive,\nor the M drive.\n\n87\n00:05:06.676 --> 00:05:10.039\nAnd the letter association,\nit's just something they pick,\n\n88\n00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:12.518\nit's usually something\nlow in the alphabet.\n\n89\n00:05:12.518 --> 00:05:17.328\nBut as long as you guys, you guys meaning\nthe people that you work with in your\n\n90\n00:05:17.328 --> 00:05:20.862\noffice, could access that\nfile on that network drive,\n\n91\n00:05:20.862 --> 00:05:23.740\nthen you could work in\nthis shared workbook.\n\n92\n00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.785\nBut this is where I always\nfeels kinda weird, so\n\n93\n00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:29.076\nare we kinda shared network drive?\n\n94\n00:05:29.076 --> 00:05:33.000\nLike, don't you both already\nhave access to the file?\n\n95\n00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.372\nAnd you can just open it, right,\nI mean- You can probably open it.\n\n96\n00:05:37.372 --> 00:05:42.170\nAnd this is is where things, I like to\nthink of a shared network drive as your\n\n97\n00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:46.900\nown personal little cloud,\nnot truly cuz it gets a little iffy.\n\n98\n00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.725\nBut I think, and\nI could be completely wrong here,\n\n99\n00:05:49.725 --> 00:05:54.259\nprobably what’s happening is if you’re\ndesignating this is a shared workbook,\n\n100\n00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:58.398\nbehind the scenes the application is\nmaking sure that, like you say you and\n\n101\n00:05:58.398 --> 00:06:01.580\nI are both editing,\nright whose edit remains upon save?\n\n102\n00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.702\nIs it the last edit,\nis it based on role permissions?\n\n103\n00:06:04.702 --> 00:06:08.227\nIt's trying to make sure you don’t\nhave this conflicting, if you and\n\n104\n00:06:08.227 --> 00:06:10.572\nI both change like an invoice number,\nright.\n\n105\n00:06:10.572 --> 00:06:14.540\nAnd we change it to something different,\ndoes mine persist or does yours persist?\n\n106\n00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.050\nThey are on shared drive, but\nhow do we make sure we have integrity of\n\n107\n00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.144\nthe document based on\ncandidate's editing permissions?\n\n108\n00:06:21.144 --> 00:06:22.856\nThat does a great point, yeah.\n\n109\n00:06:22.856 --> 00:06:28.207\nCuz I could go ahead and\nhave a non shared through Excel Workbook.\n\n110\n00:06:28.207 --> 00:06:32.382\nYou and I can open it, and\nI made changes, you made changes but\n\n111\n00:06:32.382 --> 00:06:35.540\nwe had no idea who did what, when, right?\n\n112\n00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.743\nAnd that's the biggest part\nof why you'd want to actually\n\n113\n00:06:39.743 --> 00:06:43.185\ndesignate a workbook\nthrough excel as shared.\n\n114\n00:06:43.185 --> 00:06:46.709\nBecause there is a cool thing that\ncomes along with making it shared,\n\n115\n00:06:46.709 --> 00:06:49.660\nis that you can do something\nthat tracks changes.\n\n116\n00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.363\nAnd those are synonymous, you have to\nhave it shared to do track changes,\n\n117\n00:06:53.363 --> 00:06:56.067\nyou cannot do track changes\nwithout it being shared.\n\n118\n00:06:56.067 --> 00:06:57.700\nSo tha's going to be the biggest thing.\n\n119\n00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:03.667\nAnd when you track changes, then your,\nwhat you are saying, behind the scenes,\n\n120\n00:07:03.667 --> 00:07:08.790\nhey log in any changes and\ncreate a memory of Justin changed to 500.\n\n121\n00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:13.730\nI change it to 5,000, and\nthen Bob changed it to 2.\n\n122\n00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.476\nYou would have all of\nthat being remembered,\n\n123\n00:07:17.476 --> 00:07:20.935\nas long as you share the workbook, okay.\n\n124\n00:07:20.935 --> 00:07:23.335\nAnd that's just a, that's to me,\n\n125\n00:07:23.335 --> 00:07:27.495\nthe biggest reason as why you'd\nwant to designate it as that,\n\n126\n00:07:27.495 --> 00:07:32.855\nif you just want to have it in a location\nlike we use for example, we use drop box.\n\n127\n00:07:32.855 --> 00:07:36.711\nAnd so if we can all access\nsome of the same files, but\n\n128\n00:07:36.711 --> 00:07:40.314\nnothing is shared in\ntracking who changed what.\n\n129\n00:07:40.314 --> 00:07:44.066\nThat's, I mean I know that\nDropbox does some of that too but\n\n130\n00:07:44.066 --> 00:07:46.780\nyou know what I'm trying to get at, okay.\n\n131\n00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:50.050\nIt's just something\nvery specific to Excel.\n\n132\n00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:54.512\nSo that's something I kinda wanted to\nclarify because a shared network drive\n\n133\n00:07:54.512 --> 00:07:57.404\nit's like you're already sharing ahh,\nit's.\n\n134\n00:07:57.404 --> 00:08:01.696\nAll these words right the same word that\nmeans the same thing but they don't I.\n\n135\n00:08:01.696 --> 00:08:02.725\nGosh, I love it.\n\n136\n00:08:02.725 --> 00:08:07.117\nSo back here on this webpage,\nit's just kinda already doing the whole,\n\n137\n00:08:07.117 --> 00:08:09.790\nhey don't use this, use this instead.\n\n138\n00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:14.170\nYou should be co-authoriing documents\nbecause that's what you really should do.\n\n139\n00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:18.760\nTotally understand what you're saying,\nI mean Microsoft, that's totally great.\n\n140\n00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.870\nAnd then, it's gonna go ahead and\n\n141\n00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:26.290\ntalk about how you're going to enable\nsharing a workbook what it does.\n\n142\n00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:27.320\nAnd the nice thing is,\n\n143\n00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.560\nthere's a couple of things under\nhere like unsupported features.\n\n144\n00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.140\nThis is kind of, look at how long this is.\n\n145\n00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:36.870\nWe're not even gonna read them,\nI'm like, that's a pretty long list of\n\n146\n00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:40.960\nthings that you can't do\nin a shared workbook.\n\n147\n00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:45.210\nBecause it does have some constraints\nas to what it can remember and\n\n148\n00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:49.150\nwhat it's going to do when you go\nahead and enable the track changes.\n\n149\n00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.310\nAnd actually log the track changes and\ndo things with it and accept or\n\n150\n00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:53.330\nreject the changes.\n\n151\n00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.000\nThat's in a separate episode after this.\n\n152\n00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.350\nSo just know that they go together though.\n\n153\n00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:01.480\nOkay, so then it's just kinda\ngoing through what is not there\n\n154\n00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.440\nbefore you turn off all\nthese different things.\n\n155\n00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.970\nSo this whole help file We'll\nkinda give you a little\n\n156\n00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:10.130\nbackground as to what you need to do.\n\n157\n00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:11.850\nIt does have up at the top,\n\n158\n00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:16.160\nit has a link to, this is what you\nshould be doing with coauthoring.\n\n159\n00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.700\nGonna save that for\na separate episode so we can kinda have,\n\n160\n00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.940\nthis is what shared workbooks are.\n\n161\n00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.870\nThis is where you're\ngoing to be sharing or\n\n162\n00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:26.300\ncollaborating in real time in the cloud.\n\n163\n00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:32.080\nAnd then back here it says,\nyou go to review, and\n\n164\n00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.080\nthen you go the share workbook.\n\n165\n00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.580\nWell this is the funny thing that happens,\nhere let me show you.\n\n166\n00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.650\nLet's open up, you know what, we're gonna\ndo this, I'm gonna rename this file, so\n\n167\n00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:44.960\nI'm gonna say recording.\n\n168\n00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:49.120\nSo I know that this is\nthe particular file that I'm using\n\n169\n00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.300\nin the recording of this episode.\n\n170\n00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:57.070\nIf I open this file up and this is just\nnormal right now, I didn't share anything\n\n171\n00:09:57.070 --> 00:10:04.020\nbeforehand just a normal regular, I almost\nsaid computer [LAUGH] file on my computer.\n\n172\n00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:09.550\nSo it said you need to go to the Review\nand then go to the, what did it say?\n\n173\n00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.670\nThe Shared Workbook, right?\n\n174\n00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:15.920\nJustin, I'm gonna put you on the spot.\n\n175\n00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:20.700\nUp here, do you see Shared Workbook\nanywhere on this ribbon?\n\n176\n00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.600\nI feel like you're trying to trick me but\nat current time.\n\n177\n00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.020\n&gt;&gt; I know you can't see that far but.\n\n178\n00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.690\n&gt;&gt; I can't see it.\n\n179\n00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:28.560\nThanks for the help though.\n\n180\n00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Like here you go Justin.\n\n181\n00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:33.080\n&gt;&gt; You're like I can't see that far away.\n\n182\n00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.044\nThe TV's way over there [LAUGH].\n\n183\n00:10:35.044 --> 00:10:38.150\n&gt;&gt; Well I actually can see\na fair amount so [INAUDIBLE].\n\n184\n00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:42.975\nTo protect workbook, protect sheet,\nrestrict permission, but\n\n185\n00:10:42.975 --> 00:10:45.740\nthere's no share anywhere on there.\n\n186\n00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.722\nThis is the weird thing,\nthey took it away.\n\n187\n00:10:48.722 --> 00:10:51.940\nThey [LAUGH] they just removed the button\nand it's like, okay, so you're telling me\n\n188\n00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:56.120\nthe information of how I need to do this\nbut then you don't even give it to me.\n\n189\n00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.260\nSo look at this; shared\nworkbooks removed in Excel.\n\n190\n00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.040\nAnd it's like yeah.\n\n191\n00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.640\nAnd it is talking about,\n\n192\n00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.875\nI know they are trying to force us to\ngo to co-authoring but it's just gone.\n\n193\n00:11:07.875 --> 00:11:12.130\n[LAUGH] It's just been remove, okay.\n\n194\n00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:16.340\nSo I just thought that was and again, we\nhave plenty of shared works on our local\n\n195\n00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:20.210\nfile server why are you\ntaking this away from us.\n\n196\n00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:23.930\nAnd then come to find out they've\njust taken it and hidden it.\n\n197\n00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:29.000\nSo what you can do is it's talking\nabout that you can go into your\n\n198\n00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:35.070\nribbon right here, customizing our ribbon\nwhich we have in this episode as well.\n\n199\n00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:40.130\nSo you can customize and put it on your\nquick access toolbar or find it and\n\n200\n00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:42.200\nput it on your ribbon again.\n\n201\n00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:47.310\nAnd they've already deemed it as legacy,\nall right.\n\n202\n00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:49.000\nSo, in one of these updates,\n\n203\n00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.320\ncause I've had quite a few recently,\nit's just been gone.\n\n204\n00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:57.520\nOkay, so, I added this button up on\nthe quick access toolbar right here.\n\n205\n00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:01.090\nSo you see I have shared workbook and\nit is in the legacy.\n\n206\n00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:05.280\nSo again, what I did is I did\ncustomize my quick access toolbar.\n\n207\n00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.710\nI decided to go a quick access\ninstead of doing the ribbon.\n\n208\n00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:14.120\nSo what I had to do from the quick\naccess and go into the review tab and\n\n209\n00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:18.740\nthen I found shared workbook and\nthen I pop it over to the right-hand side.\n\n210\n00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:22.820\nI've already done this so, but I was\njust showing you the steps that I did.\n\n211\n00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:27.220\nIt took me like, so as I was prepping for\nthis episode this morning and\n\n212\n00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.965\nI'm just like, where did you go?\n\n213\n00:12:29.965 --> 00:12:34.230\n[LAUGH] Yeah, it took me 30 minutes to\nkind of, I kept looking at the menus and\n\n214\n00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:39.560\nI'm trying to Google the right search\nthing to find where did it go away to?\n\n215\n00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.870\nSo, interesting, love it.\n\n216\n00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:47.090\nSo, once you get this put back\ninto your quick access toolbar.\n\n217\n00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:49.100\nI want to make this a shared workbook, so\n\n218\n00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:52.870\nyou click on here and\nnotice this is the first little thing.\n\n219\n00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:55.950\nRemember that whole like there\nthings it can't support?\n\n220\n00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:59.079\nYou can't share it right now\nbecause it's formated as a table.\n\n221\n00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:03.620\nI love Excel tables, you all know this,\nI've been telling you a long time.\n\n222\n00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:07.790\nSo wait I can't do a workbook\nthat's formatted as a table or\n\n223\n00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:09.950\nhave information formatted as a table.\n\n224\n00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:15.270\nOkay, well for this example,\nwe're just gonna say all righ,t well\n\n225\n00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:18.500\nI have to have it shared,\nI have to track my changes.\n\n226\n00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:21.760\nSo from here on this particular worksheet,\nI'll just go up to table and\n\n227\n00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.520\nI'll convert it to a normal range.\n\n228\n00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.520\nWe talked about that in that episode.\n\n229\n00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.570\nYep we're good.\n\n230\n00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:32.940\nSo now that I have the file in the data\nthat it's allowed to be shared.\n\n231\n00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.040\nWe'll go back up to that button.\n\n232\n00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:39.930\nAnd then right here do I want to allow\nchanges by more than one user at a time?\n\n233\n00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:44.150\nYes this OfficeProTV is what\nI'm logged in on this computer.\n\n234\n00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:46.870\nSo that's my username.\n\n235\n00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:47.630\nSo we've got that.\n\n236\n00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:49.240\nLike yep, that's what I want to do.\n\n237\n00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.960\nNotice over here on advance\nthis is why track changes and\n\n238\n00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:56.690\nshared workbooks co-exist together.\n\n239\n00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:59.360\nYou can keep the changes for 30 days.\n\n240\n00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.520\nYou can even increase it if\nyou wanted to update changes.\n\n241\n00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.130\nYou talked about when it is saved.\n\n242\n00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:10.850\nIt could be to where I save then you save\nand it kind of can override some things.\n\n243\n00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.370\nIt's a little weird.\n\n244\n00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:16.570\nNotice it asked me which changes when and\neverything right there.\n\n245\n00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:20.420\nJust know it can get\na little wonky sometimes.\n\n246\n00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:20.940\nWe click OK.\n\n247\n00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:23.160\nIt will now save it.\n\n248\n00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:23.870\nDo you want to?\n\n249\n00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:24.890\nYes, okay.\n\n250\n00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:31.790\nNow, if I stop right here, it still\nwouldn't be shared because it's where?\n\n251\n00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:34.790\nIt's on my local hard drive.\n\n252\n00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:40.450\nSo, I do need to put it up\ninto some networked area.\n\n253\n00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:45.500\nWhether that be on your local file\nserver within your organization.\n\n254\n00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.000\nPut it in Dropbox or what have you.\n\n255\n00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.810\nSo you need to have it in some\nlocation that multiple people or\n\n256\n00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:55.280\nthe people who are going\nto be using it are located.\n\n257\n00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:59.170\nNotice that I did not get any\noption to say specific people.\n\n258\n00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:03.910\nI didn't say, only share with Justin,\nonly share with Vaughn.\n\n259\n00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:05.420\nBecause remember, I'm JT right now.\n\n260\n00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:10.920\nSo I was not asked to give\npermissions to specific people.\n\n261\n00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:13.790\nIt's just saying this is shared.\n\n262\n00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:15.380\nHow'd I know this is shared?\n\n263\n00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.110\nSee up in the title bar?\n\n264\n00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:19.190\nIt says, share.\n\n265\n00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:22.780\nBut it's still saved to my computer.\n\n266\n00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:25.070\nSo I'm going to close this file.\n\n267\n00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:28.190\nI am going to minimize this, okay?\n\n268\n00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:33.580\nSo this is my hard drive, meaning my\nDesktop, like that's where it's saved.\n\n269\n00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:38.190\nI have another Finder window opened\nbecause this, this Vaughn folder,\n\n270\n00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:42.870\nthis is my Dropbox folder,\nwithin our organization we use Dropbox.\n\n271\n00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:46.820\nSo this is my folder that\nI hold different files in.\n\n272\n00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:50.640\nI´m going to use this\nas our network drive.\n\n273\n00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:55.290\nSo I´m going to just take this file right\ngere I'm gonna just drag and drop it.\n\n274\n00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:58.550\nI'm gonna hold the Alt key just\nto make sure that it's copying.\n\n275\n00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:59.880\nI'm not putting any other files.\n\n276\n00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:06.153\nOkay, so notice right here,\nChristmas cat share is Now in\n\n277\n00:16:06.153 --> 00:16:11.155\na networked shared\nlocation with my company.\n\n278\n00:16:11.155 --> 00:16:15.571\nOkay, cool, and\nthat's really it, in a sense.\n\n279\n00:16:15.571 --> 00:16:19.458\nSo if I went over to I'm gonna\nswitch people right now,\n\n280\n00:16:19.458 --> 00:16:23.529\nI'm gonna log into my other\nuser account on Vonne Smith.\n\n281\n00:16:23.529 --> 00:16:26.027\nSo I love how it does\nthat little flippy thing.\n\n282\n00:16:26.027 --> 00:16:30.142\nSo here's the same networked folder.\n\n283\n00:16:30.142 --> 00:16:35.043\nSo I'm going to open up my Vonne folder,\nthere's the Christmas cat, sharing.\n\n284\n00:16:35.043 --> 00:16:39.319\nAnd then it opens up, and that's it, okay?\n\n285\n00:16:39.319 --> 00:16:46.082\nThis is Dropbox specific, that's not\npart of the shared workbook stuff.\n\n286\n00:16:46.082 --> 00:16:48.374\nSo now I go ahead, and I know it's shared.\n\n287\n00:16:48.374 --> 00:16:53.283\nAnd see, it still says saved to my Mac,\neven though it's in a network drive.\n\n288\n00:16:53.283 --> 00:16:55.429\nSo don't let that throw you.\n\n289\n00:16:55.429 --> 00:16:59.045\nAnd if you're reading some new\nthings about, yeah, now you have,\n\n290\n00:16:59.045 --> 00:17:02.066\nif it's in the cloud,\nyou have this autosave that's on.\n\n291\n00:17:02.066 --> 00:17:04.818\nAutosave is not enabled right now.\n\n292\n00:17:04.818 --> 00:17:08.990\nThat's because that specifically for\nOneDrive,\n\n293\n00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:13.945\nlike in the new shared experience,\nnot the old way, right?\n\n294\n00:17:13.945 --> 00:17:16.613\nAnd the other thing I wanted to show you\non the other side, like this is the other\n\n295\n00:17:16.613 --> 00:17:18.847\nuser, there's nothing going on\nthat's special here is there?\n\n296\n00:17:18.847 --> 00:17:21.946\nThe only thing that lets you know\nits shared is that, that's it.\n\n297\n00:17:21.946 --> 00:17:25.301\nSo okay,\nwe'll just have to trust it, right?\n\n298\n00:17:25.301 --> 00:17:29.522\n[LAUGH] Justin's giving me\nthat look of like, okay?\n\n299\n00:17:29.522 --> 00:17:32.067\n&gt;&gt; So\nthis is one of those things where you go,\n\n300\n00:17:32.067 --> 00:17:34.492\nI wish there were more indicators-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n301\n00:17:34.492 --> 00:17:37.410\n&gt;&gt; That maybe someone else\nis editing the file, right?\n\n302\n00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:39.386\nAnd then when you were\nselecting that share,\n\n303\n00:17:39.386 --> 00:17:42.150\nthey gave you some options about\nwhen to push changes, right?\n\n304\n00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:46.143\nWhen to make these changes\nkinda sync up and stuff.\n\n305\n00:17:46.143 --> 00:17:49.117\nSo it's very possible that someone's\nmade a bunch of changes, but\n\n306\n00:17:49.117 --> 00:17:50.219\nthey forgot to hit Save.\n\n307\n00:17:50.219 --> 00:17:52.565\nWhen they hit Save, poom.\n\n308\n00:17:52.565 --> 00:17:53.961\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; The document that you, and\n\n309\n00:17:53.961 --> 00:17:57.040\nyou go wait a minute, I was making\nchanges based on the old version.\n\n310\n00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:02.000\nSo I can see the limitations, however,\nif you have a company workflow, right?\n\n311\n00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.660\nThis is how we make changes to the\ndocument and these two people here blah,\n\n312\n00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:06.190\nblah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n313\n00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:09.671\nThen you still may have something that\nworks, and you probably know about this.\n\n314\n00:18:09.671 --> 00:18:11.991\nBut the only thing that indicates\nthat this is a shared workbook,\n\n315\n00:18:11.991 --> 00:18:14.581\nif you need to kind of kind of keep in\nmind, is that share thing at the top.\n\n316\n00:18:14.581 --> 00:18:15.480\nIt's real weird.\n\n317\n00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.835\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthat's why the newer version will show,\n\n318\n00:18:18.835 --> 00:18:23.420\nwho is currently editing, and\nwho is kind of in the share room with you.\n\n319\n00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:27.416\nAnd that's why I kinda wanted to set up,\nis remember this is me,\n\n320\n00:18:27.416 --> 00:18:29.710\nVonne Smith as my Vonne Smith log in.\n\n321\n00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:33.421\nAnd so I notice, I did this change,\nthat I flip back over.\n\n322\n00:18:33.421 --> 00:18:39.123\nSo I'm back over into my OfficePro,\nso different person, right?\n\n323\n00:18:39.123 --> 00:18:40.512\nAnd switch on over to here.\n\n324\n00:18:40.512 --> 00:18:44.414\nOpening it up in the Network location.\n\n325\n00:18:44.414 --> 00:18:46.489\nSo now, I'm opening it.\n\n326\n00:18:46.489 --> 00:18:50.932\nNo indication that I have any,\nis anybody else hanging out with me?\n\n327\n00:18:50.932 --> 00:18:53.128\nIt doesn't show like\nVonne Smith is editing,\n\n328\n00:18:53.128 --> 00:18:54.885\nand I come over here to Weekly Sales.\n\n329\n00:18:54.885 --> 00:18:57.052\nRemember, I put something down here,\ndidn't I?\n\n330\n00:18:57.052 --> 00:18:58.290\nYou don't see it, do you?\n\n331\n00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:00.179\nNo, you know why?\n\n332\n00:19:00.179 --> 00:19:03.100\nVonne Smith hasn't saved.\n\n333\n00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:07.945\nAnd this is where I could go ahead and\nbe like Vonne as OfficePro, and\n\n334\n00:19:07.945 --> 00:19:09.823\nI'll zoom in in a second.\n\n335\n00:19:09.823 --> 00:19:14.728\nSo now I've got here, oops,\ngot to click off, and then I can zoom in.\n\n336\n00:19:14.728 --> 00:19:19.187\nAnd now I'll go ahead, and I'll fill this\nin with green or something like that.\n\n337\n00:19:19.187 --> 00:19:23.146\nSo now it's like I have two people\nworking in the same workbook, but\n\n338\n00:19:23.146 --> 00:19:26.353\nI don't know who's winning or\nwhat's going on here.\n\n339\n00:19:26.353 --> 00:19:29.415\nSo that's where it can get a little weird.\n\n340\n00:19:29.415 --> 00:19:33.141\nNow, I will say that when I\ncome back to this button,\n\n341\n00:19:33.141 --> 00:19:36.628\nnotice that I can see who\nhas this workbook open.\n\n342\n00:19:36.628 --> 00:19:39.891\nAnd that's on either side,\nit doesn't matter that this is\n\n343\n00:19:39.891 --> 00:19:42.580\nthe OfficePro is what I\nwas use when I created it.\n\n344\n00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:46.562\nIt's just that here we go,\nI know who's logged in.\n\n345\n00:19:46.562 --> 00:19:48.927\nSo I'm just gonna cancel that.\n\n346\n00:19:48.927 --> 00:19:54.357\nIf I flip back over, so\nnow we're both using the same workbook,\n\n347\n00:19:54.357 --> 00:19:56.477\nwe're both opening it.\n\n348\n00:19:56.477 --> 00:19:59.017\nSee, I don't see any changes.\n\n349\n00:19:59.017 --> 00:20:02.720\nWhen you go to Save,\nthis is where, on this site,\n\n350\n00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.307\nit's not gonna do anything, right?\n\n351\n00:20:05.307 --> 00:20:07.685\nI'm gonna switch back over,\nsorry, a lot of flip flopping,\n\n352\n00:20:07.685 --> 00:20:09.538\nbut I'm trying to show\nyou both perspectives.\n\n353\n00:20:09.538 --> 00:20:14.196\nSo I will get something over here\nthat when I go to Save it, there,\n\n354\n00:20:14.196 --> 00:20:17.924\nthat's what I was trying\nto get you to this warning,\n\n355\n00:20:17.924 --> 00:20:23.298\nwhere your workbook has been updated\nwith changes made by others, right?\n\n356\n00:20:23.298 --> 00:20:27.280\nBut it wasn't until Vonne Smith saved,\nand then I came in, and\n\n357\n00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:32.028\nthen I saved as OfficePro, and\nthen it's like, wait, what's going on?\n\n358\n00:20:32.028 --> 00:20:38.031\nSo that's where if you both are doing it\n[LAUGH] I know, it can get really messy.\n\n359\n00:20:38.031 --> 00:20:41.312\nAnd it's a little scary,\nalmost, as to why you're doing.\n\n360\n00:20:41.312 --> 00:20:45.993\nAnd that's what I think what you said\nabout your workflow like you're actual\n\n361\n00:20:45.993 --> 00:20:48.876\nproductivity workflow\nin your organization,\n\n362\n00:20:48.876 --> 00:20:51.049\nyou should really talk about this.\n\n363\n00:20:51.049 --> 00:20:53.226\nLike who's doing what, when?\n\n364\n00:20:53.226 --> 00:20:57.109\nAnd hey, let me know what you're doing and\nall that stuff, yes,\n\n365\n00:20:57.109 --> 00:21:01.079\nyou have to track changes which\nI'll show you in the next episode.\n\n366\n00:21:01.079 --> 00:21:05.790\nThat can kind of serve as a back up,\nbut talk to your coworkers.\n\n367\n00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:08.856\nTalk, and find out what is\nthe best way to make this, and\n\n368\n00:21:08.856 --> 00:21:11.541\nmaybe you realize that\nthis isn't the best way.\n\n369\n00:21:11.541 --> 00:21:14.723\nWe should go up into the cloud,\nsomebody can talk and we can chat.\n\n370\n00:21:14.723 --> 00:21:21.642\nThere's all sorts of cool things of why\nthey have Excel online, like that version.\n\n371\n00:21:21.642 --> 00:21:25.826\nThat might be the best way you need to\ncollaborate on important Excel documents.\n\n372\n00:21:25.826 --> 00:21:30.255\nSo you really do have to\nmake that decision, and\n\n373\n00:21:30.255 --> 00:21:36.477\ndetermine if that's going to be\nthe way that you should do it, so.\n\n374\n00:21:36.477 --> 00:21:39.417\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne, you keep talking\nabout these track changes, and\n\n375\n00:21:39.417 --> 00:21:43.527\nas a developer kind of individual, I'm\nlike this is like version control, right?\n\n376\n00:21:43.527 --> 00:21:47.146\nWe have our own specific workflows\nwhere you go, you made a change,\n\n377\n00:21:47.146 --> 00:21:51.272\nI made a change, if they conflict,\nthe things I use actually will say, hey,\n\n378\n00:21:51.272 --> 00:21:54.090\nthere is a conflict,\nyou all gotta figure this out.\n\n379\n00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:57.350\nSo it kind of enforces this relationship.\n\n380\n00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:00.487\nHowever, it looks like they're just kinda,\nhey, some stuffs happens.\n\n381\n00:22:00.487 --> 00:22:02.929\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well let's see what happens later.\n\n382\n00:22:02.929 --> 00:22:05.753\nSo you should definitely have\nconversations with your co-workers.\n\n383\n00:22:05.753 --> 00:22:07.447\nI know there's always that, and\n\n384\n00:22:07.447 --> 00:22:10.181\nyou're like I don't like\ntalking to people at work.\n\n385\n00:22:10.181 --> 00:22:12.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, no, I jest, but track changes,\n\n386\n00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:15.795\nis that gonna help alleviate\nthose type things?\n\n387\n00:22:15.795 --> 00:22:20.156\n&gt;&gt; It will give at least a record\nof who changed what when.\n\n388\n00:22:20.156 --> 00:22:25.058\nSo that's something that's, and\nI'll show you in the next episode.\n\n389\n00:22:25.058 --> 00:22:30.546\nSo it will show you, but doesn't do\nthings, like somebody changed formats,\n\n390\n00:22:30.546 --> 00:22:35.548\nlike filled it in, and it's only\ngoing to track your content changes.\n\n391\n00:22:35.548 --> 00:22:39.708\nSo that's where again,\nit can be a little iffy.\n\n392\n00:22:39.708 --> 00:22:43.153\nOne other thing I wanted to tell you\nabout and I can't really demonstrate it,\n\n393\n00:22:43.153 --> 00:22:44.802\ncuz it's not giving me the warning.\n\n394\n00:22:44.802 --> 00:22:48.643\nBut I had this happen all the time\nback when I was at the University,\n\n395\n00:22:48.643 --> 00:22:50.161\nwe had Shared Workbooks.\n\n396\n00:22:50.161 --> 00:22:52.792\nAnd we were on two different\nfloors within the building.\n\n397\n00:22:52.792 --> 00:22:57.413\nAnd so I would go to open it and I would\nget this, I'm sure you've gotten it,\n\n398\n00:22:57.413 --> 00:23:00.809\nthe one little box that says,\nsuch and such is editing,\n\n399\n00:23:00.809 --> 00:23:03.720\nthis document is locked,\nso and so is editing.\n\n400\n00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.855\nAnd they just kept the workbook open,\nand so\n\n401\n00:23:05.855 --> 00:23:08.251\nI have to call them,\nhey, can you close it.\n\n402\n00:23:08.251 --> 00:23:10.494\nI'm sorry let me close the workbook, and\n\n403\n00:23:10.494 --> 00:23:13.646\nthat's the only way that I\ncould go ahead and access that.\n\n404\n00:23:13.646 --> 00:23:14.472\nIt happens,\n\n405\n00:23:14.472 --> 00:23:19.367\neven though you saw that check box was\nthe only thing that you could check off.\n\n406\n00:23:19.367 --> 00:23:22.814\nBut you will get this\nworkbook is locked for\n\n407\n00:23:22.814 --> 00:23:26.369\nediting because somebody else is using it.\n\n408\n00:23:26.369 --> 00:23:30.177\nIt happened, so you will have to\ncall that person because there's\n\n409\n00:23:30.177 --> 00:23:34.265\nno way that you can get into it until\nthey close it and you can get into it.\n\n410\n00:23:34.265 --> 00:23:36.528\nSo that's a fun one too.\n\n411\n00:23:36.528 --> 00:23:37.863\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well Vonne,\n\n412\n00:23:37.863 --> 00:23:42.008\nthat's definitely one of those things that\nI've encountered, sometime not necessarily\n\n413\n00:23:42.008 --> 00:23:45.685\nin the shared workbook space but sometimes\nour operating system's log on file.\n\n414\n00:23:45.685 --> 00:23:48.758\nKeep our data from getting corrupted and\nit's on a shared drive.\n\n415\n00:23:48.758 --> 00:23:49.948\nIt's just trying to keep you safe.\n\n416\n00:23:49.948 --> 00:23:51.928\nThough annoying,\nit's trying to keep you safe.\n\n417\n00:23:51.928 --> 00:23:52.595\nAnd Vonne,\n\n418\n00:23:52.595 --> 00:23:57.085\nyou've started helping us navigate\nthe scavenger hunt that is Excel updates.\n\n419\n00:23:57.085 --> 00:23:59.083\nBut we still got to talk\nabout track changes, but\n\n420\n00:23:59.083 --> 00:24:00.608\nwe don't have time in this episode.\n\n421\n00:24:00.608 --> 00:24:02.108\nSo you're gonna have to come on back.\n\n422\n00:24:02.108 --> 00:24:05.179\nAs we continue to explore\nShared Workbooks and\n\n423\n00:24:05.179 --> 00:24:08.496\nthe things they're in that\nwe should be aware of.\n\n424\n00:24:08.496 --> 00:24:09.516\nSo definitely come on back.\n\n425\n00:24:09.516 --> 00:24:11.092\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n426\n00:24:11.092 --> 00:24:13.802\nSo signing off for OfficePro.TV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n427\n00:24:13.802 --> 00:24:14.633\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n428\n00:24:14.633 --> 00:24:15.704\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n429\n00:24:15.704 --> 00:24:21.130\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:14.812 --> 00:00:16.731\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n4\n00:00:16.731 --> 00:00:20.160\nAnd well, we made you some\npromises in the last episode about\n\n5\n00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.770\ndealing with shared workbooks.\n\n6\n00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.831\nSo we're gonna continue on with our\nExcel 2016 Advanced for Mac show,\n\n7\n00:00:25.831 --> 00:00:28.480\nand we're gonna be looking\nat tracking changes.\n\n8\n00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.320\nI put an ING on this, so\nhopefully, Vonne doesn't ding me.\n\n9\n00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.940\nAnd speaking of Vonne, well luckily,\n\n10\n00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.560\nwe have her in the studio to help\nus out with track and chase.\n\n11\n00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.330\nHow you're doing today, Vonne?\n\n12\n00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.927\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing very good.\n\n13\n00:00:37.927 --> 00:00:38.836\nHow are you?\n\n14\n00:00:38.836 --> 00:00:42.638\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic, and\nmy developer brain has been going,\n\n15\n00:00:42.638 --> 00:00:45.590\ndid we do this different in development?\n\n16\n00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.359\nBut our toolset seems to be\na little more complicated.\n\n17\n00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:52.332\nSo I'm hoping the ability\nto track changes,\n\n18\n00:00:52.332 --> 00:00:56.020\nat least give me a list of things so\nI can blame somebody.\n\n19\n00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.020\nIs that the entire, To tracking changes?\n\n20\n00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.021\n&gt;&gt; I like that, yes, so\nput the blame on someone else than me.\n\n21\n00:01:01.021 --> 00:01:05.012\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH] Or if it is me,\nthen I´m just gonna go ahead and\n\n22\n00:01:05.012 --> 00:01:10.210\naccept the change and just move on\nlike nothing Yes, [LAUGH] So exactly.\n\n23\n00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.740\nTrack changes is not\nan Excel only functionality.\n\n24\n00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.980\nWhere I use a lot,\n\n25\n00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.880\nwe were just talking about this right\nbefore we started in Word, right?\n\n26\n00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.360\nI love to put on track changes in Word,\nI do it in Acrobat too,\n\n27\n00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.385\nbecause if I am working with\nsomebody on a document.\n\n28\n00:01:29.385 --> 00:01:31.525\nI need to see what they changed,\n\n29\n00:01:31.525 --> 00:01:36.000\nwhere they changed it,\ncomment all of those types of things.\n\n30\n00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.720\nSo this is kind of, it's all over\nthe place, it's not just an Excel thing.\n\n31\n00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.070\nYou can do it in PowerPoint,\n\n32\n00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.550\nI mean there's plenty of places\nwhere check changes is great.\n\n33\n00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.576\nLike I said, I wanna blame somebody or\nat least just see what other people\n\n34\n00:01:50.576 --> 00:01:55.141\nare doing, and sometimes, maybe I just\nneed to remind myself of what I'm doing.\n\n35\n00:01:55.141 --> 00:01:57.569\n[LAUGH] Because I've had plenty\nof times where it's just,\n\n36\n00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:59.620\nI don't remember what I did yesterday.\n\n37\n00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.459\nWe'll be in the middle of an episode,\nand I'm like wait what did I just say?\n\n38\n00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:06.419\n[LAUGH] So I mean it can work\neven if it's just with you.\n\n39\n00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:10.587\nThat's fine too, but\nlike we said in the last episode,\n\n40\n00:02:10.587 --> 00:02:13.170\nyou have to share the workbook.\n\n41\n00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.590\nIf you do not share the workbook\nyou can't track changes.\n\n42\n00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.025\nThe other thing is if you go to say,\nhey highlight the track changes, and\n\n43\n00:02:20.025 --> 00:02:22.863\nthat's what basically\nturns the service on,\n\n44\n00:02:22.863 --> 00:02:27.520\nit's gonna say, I have to share\nthis workbook to make this happen.\n\n45\n00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.270\nSo they're one in the same thing.\n\n46\n00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.210\nYou can share then track or\nyou can track then share.\n\n47\n00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.170\nIt's all good, it's gonna happen, okay?\n\n48\n00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.413\nBut as soon as you share a workbook\nyou're already tracking, okay?\n\n49\n00:02:41.413 --> 00:02:44.580\nSo it's not like you had to turn on.\n\n50\n00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.020\nSo let's say, you and\nI have a shared workbook, and\n\n51\n00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.490\nI shared it out with\nyou like two weeks ago.\n\n52\n00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.780\nAnd then, I'm I need to see all\nthe changes, I need to track the changes.\n\n53\n00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.540\nI never turned it on.\n\n54\n00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.480\nNo, it's already there, okay?\n\n55\n00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.330\nso do you see what I'm trying to say?\n\n56\n00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.310\n&gt;&gt; This makes perfect sense.\n\n57\n00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.818\nEven if it's not in your face,\nthis has happened because of somehow,\n\n58\n00:03:04.818 --> 00:03:07.207\nwhen you click those\nboxes to share workbooks.\n\n59\n00:03:07.207 --> 00:03:09.901\nIt's asking you how you wanna\nresolve these issues, right?\n\n60\n00:03:09.901 --> 00:03:13.751\nWell, the only way it's gonna be able to\nresolve differences between files is if\n\n61\n00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:16.200\nit's tracking changes on\nhow things are changed.\n\n62\n00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.158\nSo even if it's not to the forefront where\nyou're like, yeah, it's tracking changes,\n\n63\n00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:22.763\nI'm not surprised that it's\nactually already doing that.\n\n64\n00:03:22.763 --> 00:03:24.748\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; The only way you can get appropriate\n\n65\n00:03:24.748 --> 00:03:26.890\nfile versions is by doing\nsomething like that.\n\n66\n00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.150\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so just so\nyou know they're together.\n\n67\n00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.468\nI have a file that I have\nbeen doing a few things, so\n\n68\n00:03:33.468 --> 00:03:37.740\nit's got like a little bit of a log,\nso we're going to use that.\n\n69\n00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.435\nAnd I'm going to show you how you\ncan turn on the track changes,\n\n70\n00:03:42.435 --> 00:03:46.780\nlist them and then accept, or\nreject them if you want to.\n\n71\n00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.160\nSo let's get started, I have a file now.\n\n72\n00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.870\nI am still in the my dropbox, so\nI'm in that shared network location.\n\n73\n00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.620\nI am in my OfficePreDemoCo login, the last\nepisode you saw me switching back and\n\n74\n00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.950\nforth in this my Vonne Smith account.\n\n75\n00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:07.970\nSo I've already done some editing in this\naccount for this particular file called A.\n\n76\n00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.875\nI just did that so it goes higher up in\nthe list, The Christmas Cats Share, okay?\n\n77\n00:04:11.875 --> 00:04:13.380\nSo that's already shared.\n\n78\n00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.800\nLet's open it up, and here we go.\n\n79\n00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.322\nWe know it's shared,\ncuz of that title bar.\n\n80\n00:04:18.322 --> 00:04:21.711\nAnd see I did the whole like\nas Vonne as OfficePro so\n\n81\n00:04:21.711 --> 00:04:26.370\nthat's what we've got kind\nof checking out down here.\n\n82\n00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.760\nAnd I'll zoom in just a little bit.\n\n83\n00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.370\nI have no idea who did, what, when?\n\n84\n00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.650\nI know that on one of my logins I\nchanged this fill color to purple.\n\n85\n00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.050\nAnd then over here, no,\nit's the addresses.\n\n86\n00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.200\nI changed this to yellow, okay?\n\n87\n00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.530\nSo there has been formatting changes.\n\n88\n00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.590\nI made this bold, and\nI changed the font color.\n\n89\n00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.954\nAnd I did make some text changes,\nI did put them in capital letters, so\n\n90\n00:04:50.954 --> 00:04:53.251\nI could kind of just differentiate it for\nmysel.\n\n91\n00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:58.487\nSo I could see that there has been changes\non both sides of my Vonne Smith account,\n\n92\n00:04:58.487 --> 00:05:00.260\nand my OfficePro account.\n\n93\n00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.210\nI need to see where they are.\n\n94\n00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.739\nLet's come back over here for now.\n\n95\n00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:09.316\nNow, this is where it's on the review tab,\nit's not on the review tab either.\n\n96\n00:05:09.316 --> 00:05:11.250\nIt's like, come on.\n\n97\n00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:17.050\nSo if it shows you and the examples\nare how you need to do your track changes\n\n98\n00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.460\nin the Mac one,\nyou don't have it on the ribbon.\n\n99\n00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.290\nOn the PC version,\nyou do have it on the ribbon, okay?\n\n100\n00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.690\nAnd I'll just pull that up right now.\n\n101\n00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.370\nI have this in the episode notes.\n\n102\n00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.730\nBut there it is again, hey, you should\nbe doing co-authoring, I know, thanks.\n\n103\n00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.770\nAnd so, it's right there,\nit's only on shared workbooks.\n\n104\n00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.310\nAnd then, it just kind of gives you some\noverviews of what I'm going to show you.\n\n105\n00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.650\nSo just to let you know that you\ndo have that help file there.\n\n106\n00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.080\nAnd we're going to the tools menu,\n\n107\n00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.400\nbecause that's where in the track\nchanges I have these two buttons.\n\n108\n00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.720\nI have the Highlight Changes, and\nthen Accept or Reject my Changes, so\n\n109\n00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.840\nthat's what I would like.\n\n110\n00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.023\nShow me, highlight,\nthe changes that had been made, so\n\n111\n00:06:03.023 --> 00:06:06.169\nI click here, and here's our dialog box.\n\n112\n00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:09.924\nSo notice that it's already\ntracking the changes,\n\n113\n00:06:09.924 --> 00:06:15.310\nbecause I did turn this on, because I\nshared it, or it was turned on for me.\n\n114\n00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.890\nSo highlight the changes,\nwhen, who, where, okay?\n\n115\n00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.130\nWhere were they like within\nthe specific space within the workbook,\n\n116\n00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:27.100\nI want the whole thing, so\nI'm not going to turn that on.\n\n117\n00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.560\nWhen?\nNow, I could do this since the last save\n\n118\n00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.720\nbut I'm gonna go with all,\ncuz I haven't done too much for one thing.\n\n119\n00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.530\nBut just notice that those are kind\nof checkpoints of like how far back\n\n120\n00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:39.790\ndo I want to go.\n\n121\n00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:43.130\nSo if you and I were working on this,\nand maybe spend a couple of days.\n\n122\n00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.703\nAnd I know that you were\nthe last one that saved it,\n\n123\n00:06:45.703 --> 00:06:49.500\nI could go ahead and just say since\nthe last time Justin saved it.\n\n124\n00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.020\nOr I could go ahead and set,\njust for forever, okay?\n\n125\n00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.620\nWell, forever meaning,\n\n126\n00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.940\nremember in that shared workbook, dial\nup box the advance it set like 30 days.\n\n127\n00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:06.060\nSo there is some limitations\nas to how much memory?\n\n128\n00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.448\nLike how far back you'll be able to go.\n\n129\n00:07:09.448 --> 00:07:10.519\nDoes that have a word for it?\n\n130\n00:07:10.519 --> 00:07:15.277\n&gt;&gt; It's probably storage,\nyour retention policy essentially for\n\n131\n00:07:15.277 --> 00:07:17.630\nyour backups, your versions.\n\n132\n00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:22.223\nNow, so you may be going, well,\nlet me just set that to like a year.\n\n133\n00:07:22.223 --> 00:07:24.577\nI can't speak and maybe you can Vonne, but\n\n134\n00:07:24.577 --> 00:07:28.610\nI suspect you're either gonna get\na hard limitation through the UI.\n\n135\n00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.399\nOr if you have a lot of changes what'll\nhappen is it's kinda saving these\n\n136\n00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:33.214\nlayers on top.\n\n137\n00:07:33.214 --> 00:07:37.539\nAnd you go, we only have three\nworksheets in this workbook but\n\n138\n00:07:37.539 --> 00:07:40.760\nit's 1.5 gigabytes in size.\n\n139\n00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.030\nWhy is that?\n\n140\n00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:46.130\nAnd well, this is based on previous\nexperience from other things like this.\n\n141\n00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:48.738\nIt's because your retention policy\nkeeps so many versions set.\n\n142\n00:07:48.738 --> 00:07:49.767\nHow does that work in Excel?\n\n143\n00:07:49.767 --> 00:07:52.551\n&gt;&gt; I'm just gonna say that I\nwould have to look that up.\n\n144\n00:07:52.551 --> 00:07:55.136\n[LAUGH] I really don't know\nthe limitations, but yeah,\n\n145\n00:07:55.136 --> 00:07:57.067\nyou could also have performance issues.\n\n146\n00:07:57.067 --> 00:08:00.146\nWhere it's just, it takes forever for\nyou to click in one box.\n\n147\n00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:04.747\nAll right, so yeah,\nI honestly don't know how far\n\n148\n00:08:04.747 --> 00:08:09.860\nback I would need to oogly\ngoogly that one and find out.\n\n149\n00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.600\nBut there's a reason why they set it\nat 30 days probably for a default.\n\n150\n00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.490\nYou can extend it but like he was\nsaying you might want to check it.\n\n151\n00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.140\nSo I would need to look that up too.\n\n152\n00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.980\nSo but I am going to use everyone.\n\n153\n00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.140\nI'm going to highlight\nthe changes on the screen and\n\n154\n00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.700\nI'm also gonna check this one off.\n\n155\n00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:28.830\nI'm gonna check list the changes\non a new sheet, that sounds fun.\n\n156\n00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:32.540\nLet's click ok and let's zoom out first\ncuz I don't know what's gonna happen.\n\n157\n00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:36.840\nWe're gonna click ok and\nthen look at that, notice down here,\n\n158\n00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.060\nit has a worksheet called history and\n\n159\n00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:43.500\nit's going through, let me zoom in on\nthis a little bit, it's going through and\n\n160\n00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:48.980\nshowing me like what date, what time,\nwho went ahead and did the changes.\n\n161\n00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.990\nThat's pretty cool, right?\n\n162\n00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:56.530\nThis is giving me all of the cell\nchanges that happened in here.\n\n163\n00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:57.650\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's kinda odd Von.\n\n164\n00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:58.950\nIt's so meta.\n\n165\n00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:03.770\nI'm getting a worksheet about the changes\nof the workbook that's occurring.\n\n166\n00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:04.660\nCrazy stuff.\n\n167\n00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:05.471\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n168\n00:09:05.471 --> 00:09:09.995\n[LAUGH] Yeah, it's pretty neat and this\nnice thing is like, who typed in 5000?\n\n169\n00:09:09.995 --> 00:09:11.420\nWho typed in 500?\n\n170\n00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:15.720\nAll of those different things are here,\nso you can see the new value,\n\n171\n00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:20.050\nwhat the cell was and\nthen what we could do with that.\n\n172\n00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:25.545\nSo it's a nice log of who did what,\nwhen and then we can go ahead and\n\n173\n00:09:25.545 --> 00:09:30.245\nfigure out well, should I tell them\nto stay or should I tell them to go.\n\n174\n00:09:30.245 --> 00:09:32.525\n&gt;&gt; So this is where we start\nplaying the blame game.\n\n175\n00:09:32.525 --> 00:09:36.945\n&gt;&gt; That is correct [LAUGH] but what we\nare going to do before we go through and\n\n176\n00:09:36.945 --> 00:09:40.030\ndo the accept and reject and\nwhether you are staying or going.\n\n177\n00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:46.100\nI did want to show you where where else\nyou're going to be seeing these changes.\n\n178\n00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:49.130\nBecause there's a check box that\nsays highlight on the screen and\n\n179\n00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:54.020\ngive me a list of all the information, so\nlet's go back over to our weekly sales and\n\n180\n00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.140\nyou can see right here, ooh,\nthat is the wrong way to go.\n\n181\n00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:00.040\n[LAUGH] Why don't we try this again,\n\n182\n00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:05.210\nlet's zoom in this way and\nthen I'll zoom in that way, there you go.\n\n183\n00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:09.880\nSo you can see that there's\nlittle boxes around those cells.\n\n184\n00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:14.120\nAnd if I come over here to the addresses,\nthere's some more boxes around.\n\n185\n00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:19.310\nAnd you see how they're also in different\ncolors too because that's for each user.\n\n186\n00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:23.970\nRemember there was me as the OfficePro and\nthem me as Vonne Smith login.\n\n187\n00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:30.830\nSo you'll be able to see those boxes on\nthe string to where they're highlight.\n\n188\n00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:35.480\nBut back over here, remember I did say\nit's not going to pick up formatting.\n\n189\n00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:41.680\nThe only thing it's showing is cell\nchanges, so where values were changed.\n\n190\n00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.731\nIt didn't say anything about,\nyou filled in the one cell of purple and\n\n191\n00:10:44.731 --> 00:10:45.880\nthe other cell is yellow.\n\n192\n00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:51.000\nThat's not going to be remembered,\nso just keep that in mind.\n\n193\n00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:56.580\nSo, we know that this is what we've\ngot going on, we can see everything.\n\n194\n00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:00.160\nSo now, the whole blame game and\nwho's going to stay and\n\n195\n00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.870\ngo, that's where we're going to accept and\nreject our changes.\n\n196\n00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:07.300\nThis is very much like we do in Word,\nright?\n\n197\n00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.650\nAnd you can accept them all or\nyou can reject them all,\n\n198\n00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:14.790\nyou can do all of that but where\nyou're gonna go is back over to tools,\n\n199\n00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:17.990\nCheck Changes and then accept or reject.\n\n200\n00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:20.040\nAnd then you can choose what time.\n\n201\n00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:24.800\nLike the ones I haven't reviewed,\nI haven't reviewed any of them, I think.\n\n202\n00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:25.800\nOr did I review some of them?\n\n203\n00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.370\nI can't remember.\n\n204\n00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:33.260\nWell, meaning before this show, when I was\npracticing before we were on the camera.\n\n205\n00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:37.870\nBut notice, you also have like\nat a particular date, so when?\n\n206\n00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:39.050\nBack to a date.\n\n207\n00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:43.010\nAnd then who, I would go ahead and choose\nis everyone because I do want to go ahead\n\n208\n00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:46.440\nand choose myself but as you can see\nthere are options for everyone but\n\n209\n00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:51.330\nme, go ahead since these are the two\nusers that were making changes to this.\n\n210\n00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:54.730\nYou could choose the Office Pro TV or\nthe Vonne Smith.\n\n211\n00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:56.550\nSo either one you want to do.\n\n212\n00:11:56.550 --> 00:12:01.480\nAnd I am choosing everything, so that's\nwhy I'm not designating the where in here.\n\n213\n00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.250\nSo let's go ahead and\nclick okay and then you can see,\n\n214\n00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:09.260\nhere we go, that it's highlighting,\nit was changed to Christmas tree.\n\n215\n00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.700\nInstead of just Christmas lane,\nI could accept or reject.\n\n216\n00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.710\nLet's go ahead and accept that one.\n\n217\n00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:18.170\nAnd the next one over here,\nwe have a teen color pink.\n\n218\n00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:19.080\nThat doesn't exist.\n\n219\n00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:22.350\nWe only have red, yellow, green and blue.\n\n220\n00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.320\nSo I know that's wrong.\n\n221\n00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.690\nSo I'm going to reject\nthis particular change.\n\n222\n00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:32.530\nAnd it should, if i go back over there,\nnotice that, that went back to blue.\n\n223\n00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:38.110\nSo it changed back to what the value\nwas before we made the change of pink.\n\n224\n00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:40.530\nAnd that,\nI did actually do some reviewing on there.\n\n225\n00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:42.700\nSo, notice there was\nonly a couple of them.\n\n226\n00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.870\nAnd then it just stops like okay,\nwe're done.\n\n227\n00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:49.970\nOkay, so I had done some reviewing\nbefore we taped the show,\n\n228\n00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:53.068\nso that's why you didn't see all\nof them going through there.\n\n229\n00:12:53.068 --> 00:12:54.627\n&gt;&gt; I was totally confused\nabout that Vonne,\n\n230\n00:12:54.627 --> 00:12:56.014\nI thought you meant during the show.\n\n231\n00:12:56.014 --> 00:12:59.332\nI was like I'm sure we have it but\nyou came in prior to the show, so\n\n232\n00:12:59.332 --> 00:13:03.080\nif you saw this huge list, you may\nactually get, if you go to the accept or\n\n233\n00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:06.706\nreject changes, you're going to get\npaired with that list that's in\n\n234\n00:13:06.706 --> 00:13:09.120\nthe history kind of\nlittle tab that's given.\n\n235\n00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.410\nBut you're not seeing that here because\nVonne was like yeah this is good this is\n\n236\n00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:14.125\ngood, hey,\n\n237\n00:13:14.125 --> 00:13:18.450\nwe like to make sure things, will they\nwork before we show you how to do them?\n\n238\n00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:21.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and right here I just did\nthe whole like I want to accept or\n\n239\n00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:25.500\nreject again and so there's nothing\nelse you've already done that So\n\n240\n00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:29.900\nI did the same options and it showed me so\nyeah, I had to remind myself on that one.\n\n241\n00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:33.970\nBut notice that the highlighting\nis still on all of these boxes.\n\n242\n00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:35.630\nSo if you wanted to turn that back off,\n\n243\n00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:39.670\nyou just go back to tools, you go back to\ntrack changes and you go to highlight.\n\n244\n00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:42.820\nAnd then you just turn off\nthe box right there, okay?\n\n245\n00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:45.750\nOr if I wanted to list it again for\nsome reason,\n\n246\n00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:49.247\nlet's go ahead and change it one more time\nand I'll take the highlighting off and\n\n247\n00:13:49.247 --> 00:13:53.260\nthen we can see and\nI also wanted to show this list again.\n\n248\n00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:57.510\nBecause now,\nnotice that there is a rejection.\n\n249\n00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:01.480\nSo right there, result of rejected action.\n\n250\n00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.440\nAnd the new value is blue.\n\n251\n00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.180\nSo notice it's saying, okay.\n\n252\n00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.680\nBut then why is this losing action?\n\n253\n00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.650\nIt's referencing here, number 10.\n\n254\n00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:13.890\nAnd that's where we made it into pink.\n\n255\n00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:17.600\nSo you see that,\nthat's the row that it's showing.\n\n256\n00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:21.420\nSo that's why there's a new number over\nhere, if you did go ahead and reject it.\n\n257\n00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:23.270\nIt's kind of like a reference.\n\n258\n00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:25.425\nLike invoice number,almost.\n\n259\n00:14:25.425 --> 00:14:27.935\nSo that's what you will\nsee at it's nicest.\n\n260\n00:14:27.935 --> 00:14:32.315\nGo ahead and log it all in and\nthen shows where the history ends.\n\n261\n00:14:32.315 --> 00:14:33.055\nPretty neat stuff.\n\n262\n00:14:33.055 --> 00:14:37.535\nAnd notice that of course you can go\nahead and have all these filters up here.\n\n263\n00:14:37.535 --> 00:14:40.405\nTo track changes can be very useful,\n\n264\n00:14:41.525 --> 00:14:46.205\nespecially if you are maybe\nthe managing partner or\n\n265\n00:14:46.205 --> 00:14:49.410\nthe person that the supervisor,\nthat's what I'm trying to say.\n\n266\n00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:53.070\nYou have everybody go ahead and input but\nthen you go ahead and sign off.\n\n267\n00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:54.790\nYup, that's good.\n\n268\n00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:57.100\nNope, there is no team pink.\n\n269\n00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:59.140\nSo then you can reject it.\n\n270\n00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:01.290\nSo that's something that\nyou do need to know.\n\n271\n00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:03.560\nThat's again, back to that whole like.\n\n272\n00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:08.550\nWho is the ower,\nwho are like the workers that kinda stuff.\n\n273\n00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:14.110\nThat's something you do have to do within\nyour own workflow because remember,\n\n274\n00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:15.190\nit's shared, right?\n\n275\n00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:17.280\nIf I was sharing this,\nyou could do the same thing.\n\n276\n00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:18.820\nYou could run this report.\n\n277\n00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:19.940\nYou could do the changes.\n\n278\n00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.520\nYou see, you gotta be careful about this.\n\n279\n00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:26.730\nIt's like, it's great but\nit's also very open.\n\n280\n00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:28.780\nSo, if you're gonna close it down,\n\n281\n00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:31.680\nyou got to do it internally\nwith the people you work with.\n\n282\n00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:32.590\n&gt;&gt; All right Vonne.\n\n283\n00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:35.801\nThe actual [INAUDIBLE] question that\nI was getting ready to ask because we\n\n284\n00:15:35.801 --> 00:15:38.010\ntalked about this is kind of available,\nright?\n\n285\n00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:39.580\nWe don't have a way to divvy up rolls.\n\n286\n00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:45.170\nI'm not the owner and you're not\na edit with the approval kind of,\n\n287\n00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:47.440\nwe can't give you up roles that way.\n\n288\n00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.080\nBut if we did want to\ndo something like that,\n\n289\n00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:52.080\nthen a shared workbook is\nprobably not what we want to use.\n\n290\n00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:56.277\nWe wanna look at other solutions\nwithin the Office space, right?\n\n291\n00:15:56.277 --> 00:16:01.977\n&gt;&gt; True or even just like you have\nto determine what way is the best.\n\n292\n00:16:01.977 --> 00:16:04.331\nDo you want to do like\nmore of an online version?\n\n293\n00:16:04.331 --> 00:16:10.002\nDo you wanna Maybe you have some internal\nchecklist I don't know, I mean there's\n\n294\n00:16:10.002 --> 00:16:15.500\nother things that you can do within\nyour organization that might be better.\n\n295\n00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:20.766\nOkay, so but I think for\nwhat it does it's pretty cool.\n\n296\n00:16:20.766 --> 00:16:25.410\nNow one thing I did want to point\nout that whole I am a kinda owner,\n\n297\n00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:31.190\nI am the leader of this and you are just\nthe data entry person, that kinda stuff.\n\n298\n00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:35.190\nThen there is something\nthat you can do and\n\n299\n00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:39.850\nsince we can both do this right and\nstart changing, you could.\n\n300\n00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:44.880\nYou could protect the workbook and\nthen password protect it.\n\n301\n00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:49.450\nAnd that way if they like try\nto turn that track changes off,\n\n302\n00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:53.140\nwell they would have to know\nhow to unprotect the workbook.\n\n303\n00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:55.180\nBut the problem is, you start doing that,\n\n304\n00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:58.270\nthere's things with protecting\nthe workbook, not the worksheet.\n\n305\n00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.860\nWorkbook, you can't add new worksheets,\nyou can't change the structure,\n\n306\n00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:04.880\nyou can't reorganize sheet tabs.\n\n307\n00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:09.220\nThat's something you might\nnot be willing to let go of.\n\n308\n00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:14.350\nOr like, no, we have to let people\nbe able to do that, then protecting\n\n309\n00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:19.115\nmight not be the best solution for hey, I\ndon't want you to turn off track changes.\n\n310\n00:17:19.115 --> 00:17:21.180\nBecause you could totally turn it off.\n\n311\n00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:26.440\nAnd then if you turn off, or\nunshare it, then all of that's gone.\n\n312\n00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.510\nLike it doesn't exist anymore.\n\n313\n00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:32.590\nOnce you come in, if I wanted to come\nback in, my little button right here,\n\n314\n00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:36.710\nand I just like turned off the sharing,\nall that goes away.\n\n315\n00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:41.531\nYou know, so it's something you\ngot to be a little careful about.\n\n316\n00:17:41.531 --> 00:17:44.080\nAnd just know you options.\n\n317\n00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.620\nKnow the options.\n\n318\n00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.820\nAlso know the limitations of this.\n\n319\n00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.030\nI'm not saying don't do it.\n\n320\n00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:54.170\nJust the more you know,\ngives you a better idea\n\n321\n00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:57.530\nof evaluating whether of not this\nis the best route for you to take.\n\n322\n00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:01.650\nAnd I believe that's pretty much\nit that I have on track changes.\n\n323\n00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:04.510\nYou just go ahead and\nkeep on logging them in and\n\n324\n00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:06.670\nknow that you could go ahead and\nfind that history.\n\n325\n00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:10.810\nAnd display it in that worksheet and\nthen you can tell people to stay or\n\n326\n00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:14.010\ngo and accept or\nreject to your heart's content.\n\n327\n00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:17.740\n&gt;&gt; Well Vonn, even though we jest, maybe\nthat's not the best managerial style.\n\n328\n00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:21.470\nWe're like, I looked up track changes and\nwell you don't work here anymore.\n\n329\n00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:24.970\nSo I wouldn't necessarily say that but\nyou did bring up some good points.\n\n330\n00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:29.470\nBecause we can't divvy out roles,\nit's part of a pre-agreed upon work flow.\n\n331\n00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:32.940\nThere's an implicit level of trust\nwhen using something like this.\n\n332\n00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:37.391\nOr you said, protect the worksheet,\nexcuse me, workbook,\n\n333\n00:18:37.391 --> 00:18:40.053\n[SOUND] I was so close to the same word.\n\n334\n00:18:40.053 --> 00:18:44.096\nBut getting out passwords for maybe\npeople who do have the responsibility,\n\n335\n00:18:44.096 --> 00:18:47.523\nit becomes a little bit of a crazy\nmanager or nightmare, right?\n\n336\n00:18:47.523 --> 00:18:51.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we talk about this in\nthe document security episodes.\n\n337\n00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:56.101\nSo it's in the Course Library IRM,\nRights Management.\n\n338\n00:18:56.101 --> 00:19:00.967\nBasically where you can do all\nsorts of different permissions but\n\n339\n00:19:00.967 --> 00:19:06.180\nthat gets into a whole other level\nof networking, if you want to say.\n\n340\n00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.860\nNetworking, like legit network as\nyour computers are connected and\n\n341\n00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:15.240\nhow your administrators have\nconnected your organization.\n\n342\n00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.350\nAnd your computers and\nhow they talk to each other.\n\n343\n00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:20.100\nNot all companies are willing\nto kinda go that far.\n\n344\n00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:24.150\nWhat is your saying?\n\n345\n00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:25.740\nYour mileage may vary, right?\n\n346\n00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:27.500\nThis is definitely one of those.\n\n347\n00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:32.690\nIt really does depend on your\nsetup on a couple levels.\n\n348\n00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:36.202\nManagerial wise and\ncomputer networking wise.\n\n349\n00:19:36.202 --> 00:19:37.340\n&gt;&gt; Alright Vonn.\n\n350\n00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:42.040\nYou said your mileage may vary but I can\nsee there's a lot of decisions to make.\n\n351\n00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:44.370\nBut this could be just\nknowing information.\n\n352\n00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:47.070\nJust knowing this is available to you\ncan help you make those decisions.\n\n353\n00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:47.980\nDo you have a large company?\n\n354\n00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:48.760\nBig company?\n\n355\n00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:49.940\nIs it just a few people?\n\n356\n00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:50.510\nWho knows.\n\n357\n00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:52.080\nThat's completely up to you.\n\n358\n00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:56.030\nBut luckily Vonn has kind of\nshown us the ropes so to speak.\n\n359\n00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:58.010\nHopefully, you're not\nplaying the blame game.\n\n360\n00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:01.090\nBut I am looking at the clock and it\nseems we're out of time for this episode.\n\n361\n00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:02.690\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n362\n00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:05.590\nSo signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n363\n00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:06.410\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n364\n00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:07.862\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n365\n00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.362\n[SOUND]\n\n",

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.720\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and well you\nbetter listen up because we are about to\n\n4\n00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.660\ncollaborate with co-authoring\nin this episode.\n\n5\n00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.030\nAnd this is part of our Excel\n2016 advanced for Mac series.\n\n6\n00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.200\nAnd here to help us along in that\nvery endeavor is Ms Yvonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.330\nHow are you doing today Yvonne?\n\n8\n00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.070\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing pretty good,\nhow are you doing?\n\n9\n00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.767\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic and a collaborate\nwith co-authoring, this seems\n\n10\n00:00:34.767 --> 00:00:39.390\nlike it might be more complicated\nthan it should be, but I don't know.\n\n11\n00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.930\nThere is a lot of long words in there so,\n\n12\n00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.812\nmaybe I'm just making\nthe wrong assumptions.\n\n13\n00:00:42.812 --> 00:00:46.442\nWell, [LAUGH] it's funny because I wanna\nsay, you hit the nail on the head and\n\n14\n00:00:46.442 --> 00:00:48.054\nthen I'm like, wait, hold on.\n\n15\n00:00:48.054 --> 00:00:51.993\n[LAUGH] This is the episode where\nI'm gonna show you everything that\n\n16\n00:00:51.993 --> 00:00:53.407\ngoes perfectly right.\n\n17\n00:00:53.407 --> 00:00:58.000\nAnd no flaws, there's no little caveats,\nand it's gonna work great.\n\n18\n00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.764\nAnd, honestly, it does, but this is also\ngonna be part of a little mini series,\n\n19\n00:01:04.764 --> 00:01:11.300\nI'm gonna call it, on collaborating\nin the cloud with Excel for Mac.\n\n20\n00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.290\nAnd you see how much I emphasized\nthere that we are in a show for\n\n21\n00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.820\nMac, so,\nthis is going to be very Mac specific.\n\n22\n00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.134\nAnd collaborating in the cloud,\nwe've done this in other episodes,\n\n23\n00:01:23.134 --> 00:01:27.810\nmaybe not you as my host,\nthat we collaborated in the cloud in Word,\n\n24\n00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.020\nin PowerPoint and some other programs\nthat are here because what do we do?\n\n25\n00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.282\nWe go to OneDrive.\n\n26\n00:01:32.282 --> 00:01:37.860\nRight as Office 365 subscribers,\nwe have access to a OneDrive for\n\n27\n00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.460\nBusiness account and\nthat's where you can go ahead and\n\n28\n00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.880\nstore your information up into\nthe cloud and then share it out.\n\n29\n00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.620\nAs you need to.\n\n30\n00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.150\nSo this isn't anything new\n\n31\n00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.370\nin a sense of we're going to be sharing\nonline and everything like that.\n\n32\n00:01:53.370 --> 00:02:00.630\nWhat is new is how they are,\nI was gonna say branding this and\n\n33\n00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.830\nthe new features that exist for Excel for\nMac in this particular way of using Excel.\n\n34\n00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.720\nSo anyway, there are some caveats that\nI will show in our troubleshooting\n\n35\n00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.700\nepisode that's after this, but like I\nsaid, it's always nice to show things\n\n36\n00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.630\nthe way they are intended to work and\nthat Microsoft is like see how easy it is?\n\n37\n00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.720\nAnd then maybe sometime it's not.\n\n38\n00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.762\n&gt;&gt; Well Yvonne, all that emphasis,\nit makes me feel like I wasn't too far off\n\n39\n00:02:28.762 --> 00:02:33.210\nbase but I'm sure you're gonna show us the\nins and outs so where do we get started?\n\n40\n00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.141\n&gt;&gt; Well why don't we get started first\nby looking at the website that I have\n\n41\n00:02:38.141 --> 00:02:43.253\npulled up, this is new to office\n365 in March co-authoring in Excel.\n\n42\n00:02:43.253 --> 00:02:48.135\nWell you look at the date, okay,\nthis is 2017 this is March 2017 we\n\n43\n00:02:48.135 --> 00:02:52.800\nare in April 2018 at the time of\nthis recording so is this brand new?\n\n44\n00:02:53.898 --> 00:02:57.580\nNo, I mean it's a relative term but\n\n45\n00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.162\nthey have done things that\nhave kind of extended this and\n\n46\n00:03:01.162 --> 00:03:04.820\nco-authoring this is something or\na term that we've used in Skype for\n\n47\n00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.090\nbusiness to where we're going ahead and\ncollaborate together and I have already\n\n48\n00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.330\nalluded to this in our previous episodes\nif you have watched our shared work book.\n\n49\n00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.100\nAnd the track changes, I kept saying well\nMicrosoft is trying to, like, get away\n\n50\n00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.510\nfrom that or at least they are trying to\ndo this new push to collaborating online.\n\n51\n00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.030\nI mean this is the whole reason\nwhy we have cloud services and\n\n52\n00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.960\nthe way everything is going now a days,\n\n53\n00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.618\ntrying to stay away from the local or\nkind of gravitate to the cloud.\n\n54\n00:03:33.618 --> 00:03:38.970\nMe, to each his own,\nI like the track changes.\n\n55\n00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.250\nI like shared work because I have\nworked with them for a long time,\n\n56\n00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.490\nthere is nothing wrong\nwith doing the old way.\n\n57\n00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.750\nThere is nothing wrong\nwith doing it the new way,\n\n58\n00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.190\nyou really just gonna have to pick\nwhich way works best for you.\n\n59\n00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.680\nAnd then it is really like\nthe path of least resistance,\n\n60\n00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.980\nthe path that's going to like just not\nmake me frustrated day in day out so\n\n61\n00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.420\nthat's something to just\nkinda to keep in mind so\n\n62\n00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.850\nin this article it's just talking\nabout that its coming to excel right?\n\n63\n00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.930\nSo it's taking like, hey we're gonna\nreally utilize these different things.\n\n64\n00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.780\nAnd a lot of times it's talking\nabout on Windows desktop, okay?\n\n65\n00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.850\nAnd these are office insider's facts.\n\n66\n00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.140\nThis is just the different ways that\nthey push out updates to people.\n\n67\n00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.010\nLike you can sign up.\n\n68\n00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.270\nTo be in the insiders club and\nget the fast updates,\n\n69\n00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.550\nbasically you get them\nbefore anybody else.\n\n70\n00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.310\nBut sometimes with those,\nit can be a little troublesome and\n\n71\n00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.540\nhave some bugs and everything.\n\n72\n00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.180\nBut those are the ones that help\nkinda work out those bugs and\n\n73\n00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.110\nthen they kinda push it out.\n\n74\n00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.400\nFor you out there,\ndepending on your organization, and\n\n75\n00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.780\ndepending how you are set up on\nwhen you do get your updates.\n\n76\n00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.130\nThat will come into play with, actually,\n\n77\n00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.580\na lot of the things that we\ntalk about in these episodes.\n\n78\n00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.320\nAnd like, what day is it,\nwhen do these updates come out,\n\n79\n00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.930\nwhat is your update schedule?\n\n80\n00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.230\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n81\n00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.870\nBut it's talking about when it is,\nand then look at,\n\n82\n00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.290\nwe're also working on co-authoring in\nExcel for Mac, so stay tuned for more.\n\n83\n00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:14.240\nSo you can see that this was a PC,\nlike, press release.\n\n84\n00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.420\nWell now it's come along to where\neverything is now available,\n\n85\n00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.660\nmost everything, is available in Excel for\n\n86\n00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.640\nMac with this whole new co-authoring and\nwhat they're trying to push through.\n\n87\n00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.660\nSo this was more of like an advertisement,\nlike a press release.\n\n88\n00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.880\nThis website that I have,\nthis is the help files that's saying, hey,\n\n89\n00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.190\nlet's go ahead and\ncollaborate with co-authoring.\n\n90\n00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.560\nSo there are a few things that you need\nto have in order to make this happen.\n\n91\n00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.540\nI already mentioned some of it.\n\n92\n00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.110\nYou need to have an Office\n365 subscription.\n\n93\n00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.930\nOkay, you need to have\nthe latest version of Office.\n\n94\n00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.080\nSo you need to have like\nthe most recent updates.\n\n95\n00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.240\nAgain, that depends on your organizations\nsettings for what updates you get when.\n\n96\n00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:06.130\nAnd then the next step would be you gotta\nupload it to your OneDrive account.\n\n97\n00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.760\nIn this example I am using OneDrive for\nbusiness, okay.\n\n98\n00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.070\nThey do say, you can put it up to regular\nOneDrive, again loving how they make\n\n99\n00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.840\nthe same name for products that do\ncompletely different things and\n\n100\n00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.660\nin different ways, and\nall that good stuff.\n\n101\n00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.800\nSo, again, I'm doing business,\nI can't totally vouch for\n\n102\n00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.730\neverything that we do that\nwill work exactly the same in\n\n103\n00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:33.190\nregular OneDrive that's on your\nWindows 10 operating system, okay?\n\n104\n00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.950\nBut it does say right\nhere in the description.\n\n105\n00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.625\nSo it should work fine, right, Justin?\n\n106\n00:06:37.625 --> 00:06:43.425\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, famous last words Yvonne,\nit's gonna be perfect.\n\n107\n00:06:43.425 --> 00:06:46.365\nBut, maybe it will for us in this episode.\n\n108\n00:06:46.365 --> 00:06:48.575\n&gt;&gt; I'm already feeling\nbad like I'm totally,\n\n109\n00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:50.235\nyou're like why am I even gonna do this.\n\n110\n00:06:50.235 --> 00:06:52.525\nYou're really making this seem so ominous.\n\n111\n00:06:52.525 --> 00:06:53.325\nIt's not.\n\n112\n00:06:53.325 --> 00:06:57.295\nI'm just trying to give you\nthe realistic picture, okay?\n\n113\n00:06:57.295 --> 00:07:01.900\nYou're gonna share it, you're gonna ask\npeople to open it, they're going to\n\n114\n00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.900\ngo ahead and do that, and then you're\ngoing to collaborate in real time.\n\n115\n00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.260\nThere is something now in the last\ncouple of months that has,\n\n116\n00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.980\nkind of, called autosave.\n\n117\n00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:16.250\nAutosave is up in the upper left-hand\ncorner of your Excel environment, and\n\n118\n00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:23.160\nit will only work if you are saving\nfiles to a OneDrive location.\n\n119\n00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:27.100\nNow this is the auto save is\nactually completely separate than\n\n120\n00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.070\nthe co-offering, okay.\n\n121\n00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:36.260\nIt's part of it only because it's\ngoing to be part of OneDrive, okay.\n\n122\n00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:37.820\nI hope that make sense.\n\n123\n00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.697\nI could have a file that\nonly I'm working on,\n\n124\n00:07:40.697 --> 00:07:45.243\nnot doing any collaboration with them,\nnot sharing with anybody, and\n\n125\n00:07:45.243 --> 00:07:50.088\nif I have saved it to my OneDrive account\nthe autosave is going to be available\n\n126\n00:07:50.088 --> 00:07:54.509\nto me, meaning it's going to\nautomatically save my document boom.\n\n127\n00:07:54.509 --> 00:07:59.129\nSo like the save and save button\nbasically doesn't work anymore,\n\n128\n00:07:59.129 --> 00:08:03.017\nit doesn't exist in that sense,\nit still lives there.\n\n129\n00:08:03.017 --> 00:08:04.466\nBut you don't have to do that.\n\n130\n00:08:04.466 --> 00:08:07.910\nYou don't have to remember\nto save your files.\n\n131\n00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:09.200\nIt does that automatically.\n\n132\n00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.710\nNot if you have it on your local versions,\nokay.\n\n133\n00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:17.920\nAnd that's just something\nthat you need to be aware of.\n\n134\n00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:23.022\nI've read some articles about how\nsome people don't like auto save.\n\n135\n00:08:23.022 --> 00:08:26.495\nBecause you don't have any control\nover the changes that you've made.\n\n136\n00:08:26.495 --> 00:08:30.120\nIt's just like, it's just gonna save for\nyou whether you like it or not.\n\n137\n00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.400\nDo you have any opinion on that Justin?\n\n138\n00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:37.840\n&gt;&gt; So, having dealt with individuals\nwho are like I forgot to save that.\n\n139\n00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.540\nWell where is it?\n\n140\n00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:41.910\nIt's in OneDrive.\n\n141\n00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:44.730\nWell, why are you, hold on.\n\n142\n00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:47.490\nSo they're like using\nthe synced version I was like,\n\n143\n00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:50.340\nwhy don't you just do it this way?\n\n144\n00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.125\nWell why would I do that?\n\n145\n00:08:51.125 --> 00:08:54.650\nWell you know how you just lost all that\ninformation that you forgot to save?\n\n146\n00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:57.332\nOr you computer goes [NOISE].\n\n147\n00:08:57.332 --> 00:09:01.740\nFor me, I'm okay with it, just\nbecause it keeps me from having not so\n\n148\n00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.249\ngood accidents, where you're like,\n\n149\n00:09:04.249 --> 00:09:09.470\nI just spent an hour putting this together\nand now it's not available to me.\n\n150\n00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:10.000\n&gt;&gt; Me too.\n\n151\n00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.370\nPersonally I think it's a great thing.\n\n152\n00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:14.610\nBut I can see the post that I was reading,\nthe guy's like,\n\n153\n00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:18.980\nI need control over when I save,\nbecause a lot of times I'll save copies.\n\n154\n00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:25.310\nAnd now, it's like I don't even know at\nwhat point my changes have been made.\n\n155\n00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:28.850\nBecause I need to go, but\nI get it, I totally do.\n\n156\n00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:33.020\nBut it's just kind of something I wanted\nto throw out there that it is new in Mac\n\n157\n00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.060\nworld that you can get auto save.\n\n158\n00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.636\nAnd we'll go through some of these other\nthings as we go through some of our\n\n159\n00:09:37.636 --> 00:09:40.070\ntroubleshooting and everything like that.\n\n160\n00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:43.848\nSo anyways, just gonna set the scene\nthat this is what you need to do,\n\n161\n00:09:43.848 --> 00:09:46.530\nbe aware of some things\nthat are going to happen.\n\n162\n00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:50.256\nSo let me show you how it's going\nto work perfectly, fingers crossed.\n\n163\n00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:53.010\n[LAUGH] In our files, so\nnotice where I have my files.\n\n164\n00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.594\nI have a sort and filter share but\n\n165\n00:09:55.594 --> 00:10:00.330\nit is a duplicated one that\nwe use in another example.\n\n166\n00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.730\nIt is on my desktop right now, okay?\n\n167\n00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:06.470\nAnd if I look up here,\nsee it says saved to my Mac.\n\n168\n00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:11.400\nSo always look at your title bar,\nregardless of whatever you're doing.\n\n169\n00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.750\nThat lets you know where you're at.\n\n170\n00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:16.440\nSo I would some like some help with this.\n\n171\n00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.190\nI'd like to collaborate with Justin.\n\n172\n00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:20.600\nNow, I'm Justin right now, too.\n\n173\n00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.500\nI'm J.T., he's Justin.\n\n174\n00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.290\nHe's J.D..\n[LAUGH] We talked about that.\n\n175\n00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:27.610\nAnd then I'm also going to share\nit with myself as in my Vonne, and\n\n176\n00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:33.050\nI'm also going to share it with Joey,\nwho is part of our Office Pro Demo Co..\n\n177\n00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.505\nSo what I need to do is I gotta put\nit up into my OneDrive account.\n\n178\n00:10:35.505 --> 00:10:39.000\nI'm already signed in,\n\n179\n00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.020\nin my Office products cuz I have to be,\nreally, to make it work.\n\n180\n00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:45.880\nSo there's a couple places you can do it.\n\n181\n00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.390\nOver here in the upper right hand corner,\nthere's a Share.\n\n182\n00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:50.360\nI tend to like that the best.\n\n183\n00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.580\nBut there's also the File menu,\nand then there's Share,\n\n184\n00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.850\nand then you can go through here.\n\n185\n00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.300\nI just like this interface better.\n\n186\n00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.170\nSo we're going to go over here, and\nthen it says okay, what do you want to do?\n\n187\n00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:03.370\nDo you want to move or\ncopy this two-year OneDrive?\n\n188\n00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:08.420\nNow, notice you have the option\nhere of either moving it from your\n\n189\n00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:11.770\ndesktop up into your cloud, or\ndo you want to make a copy?\n\n190\n00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:16.020\nHave a copy in both locations.\n\n191\n00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.110\nTotally up to you.\n\n192\n00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:19.060\nI'm gonna move it cuz I'd\nlike to put it there.\n\n193\n00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:21.520\nI'm already connected, so I'm fine there,\n\n194\n00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.350\nand I don't have multiple\nOneDrive accounts.\n\n195\n00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:27.340\nSo I want that one, and\nthen I'm just gonna upload it.\n\n196\n00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.880\nNow there is this Send a Copy, okay,\n\n197\n00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.690\nbecause this is all connected\nthrough your Office products.\n\n198\n00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:38.850\nSo I could email it with Outlook or\nI could also, what is this button?\n\n199\n00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:39.790\nI can send it to other places.\n\n200\n00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:40.840\nBecause this is Apple.\n\n201\n00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.683\nOkay, so I could go ahead and\nAirDrop and all, but\n\n202\n00:11:43.683 --> 00:11:47.360\nthat's just like if I had opened\nup my email and attached a copy.\n\n203\n00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.500\nIt's just a shortcut way of getting to it.\n\n204\n00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:54.220\nBut we don't want that because we\nwant to collaborate in real time.\n\n205\n00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.830\nSo I'm going to move this into\nmy OneDrive, click Upload, and\n\n206\n00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:00.210\nthen let's go ahead and do this.\n\n207\n00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:01.640\nDo notice,\n\n208\n00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:06.620\nanytime you're working in the cloud,\nyou are at the mercy of the Internet.\n\n209\n00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:11.560\nI am on a wireless connection, so\nI do have to take that into account.\n\n210\n00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:15.980\nI think we're pretty close to an access\npoint so I think it's pretty fast.\n\n211\n00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:20.150\nBut that's what you get\nwhen you work online, so.\n\n212\n00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:23.250\n&gt;&gt; And this is one of those things where\nthat is also document dependent, right?\n\n213\n00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:26.790\nSo if you have a lot of embedded images or\nother things like that,\n\n214\n00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:29.950\nit may take a little bit longer,\nso don't necessarily freak out.\n\n215\n00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:31.050\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and\n\n216\n00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:34.520\nlet's look over here in the upper left\nhand corner, my AutoSave was turned on.\n\n217\n00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:39.080\nI didn't point out that it was greyed out\nup until that point, now, it is available.\n\n218\n00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.920\nSo, if you didn't want AutoSave,\nyou can turn it off.\n\n219\n00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.930\nIt's just a switch, okay.\n\n220\n00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.330\nBut, do know it is on by default.\n\n221\n00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:49.380\nSo, that's a good thing\njust kind of look for that.\n\n222\n00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:53.000\nAnd, then of course also our little Save\nbutton becomes like, it has a different\n\n223\n00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.380\nicon, cuz now it's like just refreshing\nthose changes up into your cloud.\n\n224\n00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:01.810\nAnd we've got here so now,\nI've put it up in my OneDrive account.\n\n225\n00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:04.740\nNow I need to invite\npeople to work with me.\n\n226\n00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.556\nAnd this is going to be\nconnected to your Outlook, so\n\n227\n00:13:07.556 --> 00:13:09.482\nit's going to send that email out.\n\n228\n00:13:09.482 --> 00:13:12.504\nIt's gonna connect into\nother people's Outlook or\n\n229\n00:13:12.504 --> 00:13:17.175\nreally any email because that's how\nthey're going to get the notification that\n\n230\n00:13:17.175 --> 00:13:20.190\nyou are asking them to co-author with you.\n\n231\n00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:21.420\nSo I'm gonna click the Share button.\n\n232\n00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.310\nNotice that now it's gonna be a little\ndifferent because it's already in my\n\n233\n00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:26.250\nOneDrive account.\n\n234\n00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:30.290\nSo now, you need to invite, but\nyou gotta be careful right here.\n\n235\n00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:33.850\nI've done this a couple of times, where\nI start typing in justin@itpro.tv and\n\n236\n00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:35.570\nit's like, you can't do that.\n\n237\n00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:40.470\nI'm like, that's because right now I have\nit set for anybody within my organization.\n\n238\n00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:43.310\nOkay, that would be my OfficePro demo co.\n\n239\n00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:46.470\nI don't really need that,\nI need specific people, okay?\n\n240\n00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:51.850\nSo you can do it organizational wide\nbecause maybe you're signing up for\n\n241\n00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:56.140\nyour cook off, or what have you, and\nyou wanna say, everybody go ahead and\n\n242\n00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.100\nput what you're signing up for.\n\n243\n00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.590\nOr bringing,\nthat might be something we're doing.\n\n244\n00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:02.620\nWe're going with specific people.\n\n245\n00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:05.950\nAnd we're good, I'm going to click the\nApply button, which is right down here,\n\n246\n00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:07.760\nand we are going to allow them to edit.\n\n247\n00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:11.240\nSo I want them to Edit, not just view.\n\n248\n00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.120\nSo I will apply and\nnow I type in people's addresses.\n\n249\n00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:19.760\nSo I will go ahead and\ndo justin@itpro.tv and there you are.\n\n250\n00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:23.050\nI will put in myself,\nit's always weird when I refer to myself.\n\n251\n00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.780\nBecause I'm like 15 different\npeople in these episodes.\n\n252\n00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:30.890\nAnd, not 15, really like three or\nfour, right?\n\n253\n00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:32.060\nSo there is that.\n\n254\n00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:37.630\nGood, and we will add Joey, just for fun.\n\n255\n00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:38.450\nAnd that should pop up.\n\n256\n00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:40.260\nYeah, there he is.\n\n257\n00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.770\nAnd so now I've shared it\nwith three different people.\n\n258\n00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:46.000\nSo there's a couple other buttons that\nare down here that were behind my head,\n\n259\n00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.030\nwhere we have this Copy Link and\nwe have this Outlook.\n\n260\n00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:54.530\nI'm just gonna tell you right now\nthere's ways that you can go ahead and\n\n261\n00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:59.610\nsend a link to somebody,\nlike where you just send them a URL.\n\n262\n00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:05.340\nRight now, since we have a mix of people\nthat are inside our organization,\n\n263\n00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:08.800\noutside of our organization,\nit's going to throw an error.\n\n264\n00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.540\nI'm not going to do it right now\nbecause then I will have to retype all\n\n265\n00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:12.170\nthis stuff in.\n\n266\n00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:15.760\nAnd it's going to throw an error and\nit's going to say this doesn't work and\n\n267\n00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.250\nit's going to be kind of weird.\n\n268\n00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:18.550\nI'm just going to tell you now,\n\n269\n00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:23.870\nif you want to send people links to\nthe document as a URL, like in a chat.\n\n270\n00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:26.900\nLike maybe use Slack or\nyou're texting somebody or\n\n271\n00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:30.390\nwhatever, don't do it through this way.\n\n272\n00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:34.080\nDo it in OneDrive and\nthen you can go ahead and get that and\n\n273\n00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.465\nbe able to send it out because it gets.\n\n274\n00:15:35.465 --> 00:15:39.940\nAnd Microsoft does some really weird\nthings with how it generates your links.\n\n275\n00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:43.390\nI'm gonna save you the gory details.\n\n276\n00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:46.540\nIf you're using Excel,\nlocal version installed,\n\n277\n00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:47.770\nthis is the way you should do it.\n\n278\n00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:50.200\nType in their email address and\njust click the send button.\n\n279\n00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.960\nDon't worry about\nthe stuff that's below it.\n\n280\n00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:55.997\nIt's just easier, okay, I promise.\n\n281\n00:15:55.997 --> 00:15:59.077\nAll right, so that means that\nI've got my people in here.\n\n282\n00:15:59.077 --> 00:16:03.453\nWe're gonna go ahead and click the send\nbutton and the it just poof away.\n\n283\n00:16:03.453 --> 00:16:07.350\nWell, it doesn't go away really, it just\ngoes to the ether and everything goes,\n\n284\n00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:08.823\ncuz this is connected to your.\n\n285\n00:16:08.823 --> 00:16:12.286\nOutlook, this is going through\nyour Outlook outbox, and\n\n286\n00:16:12.286 --> 00:16:16.597\neverybody's gonna go ahead and\nget an email that says you're sharing,\n\n287\n00:16:16.597 --> 00:16:20.860\nwhich I will show you the other\nside of this in just a second, so.\n\n288\n00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.160\n&gt;&gt; Now, Vonne, I do have a quick question.\n\n289\n00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.810\nSo it says send now, and\nI just got the email, right?\n\n290\n00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:27.660\nThis is a collaborative effort, right?\n\n291\n00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:29.560\nYou have to have someone\nelse to collaborate.\n\n292\n00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:32.320\nVonne can't be pretending to be\nother people all the time, but\n\n293\n00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.710\nif I go and re-click that Send button,\n\n294\n00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:37.810\ndo I see the list of people that\nI have already sent that to?\n\n295\n00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:38.745\n&gt;&gt; The share up here?\n\n296\n00:16:38.745 --> 00:16:40.477\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No!\n\n297\n00:16:40.477 --> 00:16:44.062\n[LAUGH] Yeah, and\nI'm glad you pointed that out,\n\n298\n00:16:44.062 --> 00:16:49.570\nbecause there are sometimes when I went\nahead and typed a little stuff out,\n\n299\n00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:55.364\nand then I switched over to, I don't know,\nanother program for a little bit.\n\n300\n00:16:55.364 --> 00:16:59.670\nAnd then I came back and I'm like, wait,\nI have to redo that all over again?\n\n301\n00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:03.730\nIt doesn't save, if you want to say,\nall the things, and\n\n302\n00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:09.610\nthis is also not where you manage your\nsharing permissions, that's OneDrive.\n\n303\n00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:10.975\nRemember this is all connected.\n\n304\n00:17:10.975 --> 00:17:16.165\nSo this is really just a shortcut for\nus to do all of the OneDriving,\n\n305\n00:17:16.165 --> 00:17:21.280\nand the sharing, and the editing,\nand how you kind of use it out.\n\n306\n00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:23.680\nIt's a separate entity.\n\n307\n00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.450\nIt's not Excel.\n\n308\n00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:27.910\nThis is just a quick\nlittle way of doing it.\n\n309\n00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:32.420\nSo I'm glad you pointed that out, because\nit does drive me crazy a little bit.\n\n310\n00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:36.460\nCool, so now I know that we are in\nOneDrive, I know up on my title bar,\n\n311\n00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:37.240\nit's there.\n\n312\n00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:42.737\nSo, I am the me as JT, okay,\nI am the owner of this document.\n\n313\n00:17:42.737 --> 00:17:47.690\nI am the one who has initiated this\nsharing collaborative process.\n\n314\n00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:51.353\nWe're now gonna flip on over to\nthe other side, and when I mean flip,\n\n315\n00:17:51.353 --> 00:17:52.940\nwe're gonna flip accounts.\n\n316\n00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:56.638\nYou are gonna go onto my\nother account on my Mac, and\n\n317\n00:17:56.638 --> 00:18:00.971\nwe will do this really cool\nlike [SOUND] in just a second.\n\n318\n00:18:00.971 --> 00:18:02.941\nI guess that way, okay.\n\n319\n00:18:02.941 --> 00:18:04.890\n[LAUGH] I already have my email open.\n\n320\n00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:08.090\nNow, this is my vonne@itpro.tv account.\n\n321\n00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:10.440\nI'm already in the Other,\ncuz I know it's gonna come in the Other,\n\n322\n00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:13.410\ncuz you've seen I've kinda\nplayed around with this before.\n\n323\n00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:16.530\nSo here is that email from\nJustin Timberlake, and if I open it,\n\n324\n00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:22.430\nit's like hey, this person wants to\nshare out this Sort and Filter SHARE.\n\n325\n00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:24.370\nCool, sounds great.\n\n326\n00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.919\nWe're all happy,\nlet's go ahead and click on it.\n\n327\n00:18:26.919 --> 00:18:32.186\nAnd then it opens up into my browser, and\nlike just like any good Microsoft product\n\n328\n00:18:32.186 --> 00:18:37.108\nthey want to go ahead and verify that you\nare the person that this has been sent to.\n\n329\n00:18:37.108 --> 00:18:40.936\nOkay, fine, let's go ahead and\nsend the code, and\n\n330\n00:18:40.936 --> 00:18:44.065\nthis should happen to almost everybody.\n\n331\n00:18:44.065 --> 00:18:48.030\n[LAUGH]\nSometimes,\n\n332\n00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:51.360\nyou don't get any share code and\nsometimes you do.\n\n333\n00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.810\nWe're still trying to find the rhyme or\nreason about that one aren't we, Justin?\n\n334\n00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:55.880\n&gt;&gt; So it's kind of odd.\n\n335\n00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:00.860\nFull disclosure,\nwe are gonna break the movie magic here,\n\n336\n00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.810\nwe try to make sure things work just so.\n\n337\n00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:05.640\nI've gotten the share\ncode sometimes from you.\n\n338\n00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.782\nThis particular instance,\nI am already in the document, and\n\n339\n00:19:07.782 --> 00:19:09.275\nI didn't get the share code, but you did.\n\n340\n00:19:09.275 --> 00:19:09.905\n&gt;&gt; You didn't get it?\n\n341\n00:19:09.905 --> 00:19:12.834\n&gt;&gt; So we're from the same organization,\nand one of us got the share code and\n\n342\n00:19:12.834 --> 00:19:13.800\nthe other one didn't.\n\n343\n00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:14.300\nI don't know.\n\n344\n00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.300\n&gt;&gt; Meaning ITPRO.TV,\nlike we are in the same.\n\n345\n00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:17.069\nSo you did not even get one.\n\n346\n00:19:17.069 --> 00:19:18.429\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So, okay,\n\n347\n00:19:18.429 --> 00:19:21.701\nwell I guess it just doesn't like me.\n\n348\n00:19:21.701 --> 00:19:23.270\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I haven't done anything\n\n349\n00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:26.377\nelse in the document, so\nmaybe it pops up because,\n\n350\n00:19:26.377 --> 00:19:30.060\nwell, you're using Chrome and\nI'm using Firefox.\n\n351\n00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:33.630\nSo it may prompt me later, so\nif it does, I'll let you know.\n\n352\n00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:36.590\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah,\nmaybe it is browser specific.\n\n353\n00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:39.960\nWe are really trying to give\nyou guys straight answers,\n\n354\n00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:44.542\nand sometimes it does,\nsometimes it doesn't, right?\n\n355\n00:19:44.542 --> 00:19:50.710\n[LAUGH] But do know for people, you being\nthe recipient of a shared document,\n\n356\n00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:53.380\nor as an owner, just know that\nthis might happen to people.\n\n357\n00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:57.459\nBe like, hey, I couldn't get into it,\nsomething happened.\n\n358\n00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:00.710\nWhatever, we'll deal with\nthat in the next episode.\n\n359\n00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:05.765\nSo we've got our validation code,\nand it's only gonna be valid for\n\n360\n00:20:05.765 --> 00:20:10.060\n15 minutes, so I don't mind you all\nseeing this special share code,\n\n361\n00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:12.530\nbecause even if you tried,\nit's not gonna work.\n\n362\n00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:15.430\nSo I go ahead, all I did was copy and\npaste, Cmd+C, Cmd+V.\n\n363\n00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:20.640\nI verify and then it should,\nyep, here I am.\n\n364\n00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:25.807\nI am, going ahead and\ncollaborating in real-time\n\n365\n00:20:25.807 --> 00:20:30.490\nas vonne@itpro.tv, with JT and Justin.\n\n366\n00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:32.550\nAnd you are in right now, as well.\n\n367\n00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:33.080\n&gt;&gt; I am.\n\n368\n00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:34.070\nI am not in edit mode.\n\n369\n00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:39.250\nI am just purely in read mode, and I'm\nthere, I'm seeing the same thing you are.\n\n370\n00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:39.950\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n371\n00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:45.845\nSo now, as a recipient, I want to start\nediting this, right, as a Mac user.\n\n372\n00:20:45.845 --> 00:20:51.431\nNot a PC user, as a Mac user, you only\nget the option to edit in the browser,\n\n373\n00:20:51.431 --> 00:20:56.138\nas a recipient of a coauthored,\nshared document.\n\n374\n00:20:56.138 --> 00:21:00.490\nYou're like, but I've seen that\nbutton where it says edit in Excel,\n\n375\n00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:04.672\nthat's different,\nthis is somebody that shared this with me.\n\n376\n00:21:04.672 --> 00:21:08.970\nWhen you're working with your own\ndocuments, you could do either one.\n\n377\n00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:10.510\nWeird caveat, right?\n\n378\n00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:13.600\nAnd it's a Mac thing, it's not a PC thing.\n\n379\n00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:18.960\nSo, if I click Edit in browser, I will now\nbe able to start editing in the browser,\n\n380\n00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.442\nand I wouldn't mind if you've\nalready done that too, please.\n\n381\n00:21:21.442 --> 00:21:24.422\n[LAUGH] So, Justin's sitting there like,\nI'm just waiting.\n\n382\n00:21:24.422 --> 00:21:28.700\n[LAUGH] So, now I'm going to go ahead and\nget that I'm working in this, and\n\n383\n00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:30.550\nthis is the Internet, right?\n\n384\n00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:34.860\nSo it should hopefully start\npopulating soon, that I am\n\n385\n00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:38.470\nactually sharing with other people, and\nI will be able to see, there it goes.\n\n386\n00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:40.830\nSee, I was waiting and I'm like,\njust fill in the space, Vonne.\n\n387\n00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:45.890\nIt will happen that I have two\nother people editing this document,\n\n388\n00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:48.910\nand please do click around,\nif you don't mind there, Justin.\n\n389\n00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:53.180\nSo I can see that Justin\nis editing in cell I3.\n\n390\n00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:55.567\nJustin Timberlake is in M21.\n\n391\n00:21:55.567 --> 00:21:56.252\nCool.\n\n392\n00:21:56.252 --> 00:21:59.120\nAnd the neat thing is that I\ncan actually click on it, and\n\n393\n00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:03.520\nit's going to the place where that\nperson is actually editing right now.\n\n394\n00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.528\nNice, I can see that he's filled\nin these cells with blue.\n\n395\n00:22:05.528 --> 00:22:08.898\nAnd the other kind of\nneat thing that I see is,\n\n396\n00:22:08.898 --> 00:22:15.160\nI can see where everybody's going,\nand then up here, I also have a chat.\n\n397\n00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.940\nOkay, cuz this is kind of neat.\n\n398\n00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.750\nHey, I don't wanna pick up the phone,\nand actually talk\n\n399\n00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:24.100\nto you on the phone while we're editing\nthis document, we're gonna chat.\n\n400\n00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:25.090\nIsn't that cute.\n\n401\n00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:30.120\nOkay, now I'm again in as a recipient,\nin the editing in the browser,\n\n402\n00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:36.100\nwhich is the only way that I can edit\nan Excel document as a Mac user.\n\n403\n00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.960\nIt will tell me that I am chatting,\nand it will not be saved.\n\n404\n00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:43.145\nThe chat is a session variable.\n\n405\n00:22:43.145 --> 00:22:44.460\nIt's only during this session.\n\n406\n00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:46.360\nIt's not gonna be stored\nwith the document.\n\n407\n00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:49.050\nJust to let you know, behind my head you\ncan see that there's little box right\n\n408\n00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:52.500\nhere, where I can say like,\nhello and then I can hit Enter.\n\n409\n00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:56.350\nAnd then I'll be able to start\nchatting with everybody involved.\n\n410\n00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:58.987\nI can see Justin,\nsorry there's a little bit more.\n\n411\n00:22:58.987 --> 00:23:01.450\n[LAUGH] See I can see he's typing,\nlike, hi.\n\n412\n00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:03.400\nAnd then there'll be a little button.\n\n413\n00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:07.216\nSo this is just like any other chat\nthat you'll see, Justin is typing, and\n\n414\n00:23:07.216 --> 00:23:08.770\nthat's pretty cool, nice.\n\n415\n00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:11.500\nSo I can see everybody's working together,\nand\n\n416\n00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:16.560\nwe can collaborate, in real time,\nand I'm a recipient.\n\n417\n00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:19.450\nBut what about the owner, right?\n\n418\n00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:22.100\nOkay, we're gonna switch, okay.\n\n419\n00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.595\nYou can keep doing your thing.\n\n420\n00:23:23.595 --> 00:23:28.172\n[LAUGH] I'm gonna just go ahead and\npop back over as JT,\n\n421\n00:23:28.172 --> 00:23:30.832\nas the owner of this document.\n\n422\n00:23:30.832 --> 00:23:35.701\nAnd remember, I'm in my local Excel, okay?\n\n423\n00:23:35.701 --> 00:23:38.241\nAs the owner of a shared document,\n\n424\n00:23:38.241 --> 00:23:43.280\nI'm the one who started this\nwhole collaboration process.\n\n425\n00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:49.075\nI can stay in my local version,\nand edit, okay?\n\n426\n00:23:49.075 --> 00:23:55.320\nIt's the recipients that can't do it in\nyour desktop installed version of Excel.\n\n427\n00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:00.823\nAnd I can see up here at the top\nthat I've got a J and a V,\n\n428\n00:24:00.823 --> 00:24:04.844\nthat indicates that other\npeople are editing.\n\n429\n00:24:04.844 --> 00:24:09.530\nSo I still see the same thing in my local\nversion as the person who started this,\n\n430\n00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:13.009\nand I can go to that particular So,\nthey're color coded.\n\n431\n00:24:13.009 --> 00:24:16.499\nI can see that Vonne is at G12.\n\n432\n00:24:16.499 --> 00:24:17.760\nOkay, cool.\n\n433\n00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:23.190\nAnd now that I have it shared and you all\nare chatting, I have a little chat button.\n\n434\n00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:27.890\nThis doesn't come up until you start\nactually collaborating with people and\n\n435\n00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:28.800\nthey're using a chat.\n\n436\n00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.800\nSo if I click on the chat.\n\n437\n00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:35.070\nNotice back here, it is connecting,\nso it's going to go ahead, and\n\n438\n00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:37.840\nnow it's letting me say hey,\nlet's go ahead and type a message.\n\n439\n00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.631\nAnd I can say hello, and did you get that?\n\n440\n00:24:40.631 --> 00:24:41.730\nOkay, good [LAUGH].\n\n441\n00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:42.420\n&gt;&gt; I did get that.\n\n442\n00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:46.710\nAnd what's kinda odd though is\nyou said it's session specific,\n\n443\n00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:50.630\nthe previous things that we've typed\nare not actually in the local version.\n\n444\n00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:54.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's something like if you\nthink about it this way desktop version,\n\n445\n00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:59.600\nI didn't open up the chart until now.\n\n446\n00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:03.410\nSo if there is a little latency or\n\n447\n00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:08.040\njust some discrepancies like I didn't get,\nhey can you type it over.\n\n448\n00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:12.030\nIt might be because hey, somebody\ndidn't bring the chat up right away.\n\n449\n00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:15.590\nAnd if you look behind my head, again,\nyou can see that Justin is typing.\n\n450\n00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:19.945\nSo I can see the same things perfect.\n\n451\n00:25:19.945 --> 00:25:24.865\nYeah, it's kind of like I've just\njoined the conversation, thanks.\n\n452\n00:25:24.865 --> 00:25:27.805\n[LAUGH] And then we can go ahead and\nkeep on going.\n\n453\n00:25:27.805 --> 00:25:30.905\nBut yes, this will not save with the file.\n\n454\n00:25:30.905 --> 00:25:36.025\nBut it is pretty cool that in\nthe desktop version of Excel for\n\n455\n00:25:36.025 --> 00:25:39.720\nMac as an owner, I can still participate.\n\n456\n00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:45.830\nAnd I never even had to, like, go online\nand go into the cloud and do Excel online.\n\n457\n00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:51.080\nI can do it all right here,\nas the starter and owner of this sharing.\n\n458\n00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:54.170\nSo pretty neat, I like it.\n\n459\n00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:55.670\nAnd that's what's going to go on, and\n\n460\n00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:58.890\nwe can go ahead and\nkeep on changing things as we go.\n\n461\n00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:03.450\nCool, everything's working pretty smooth,\nright there Justin?\n\n462\n00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:04.380\n&gt;&gt; It appears to be.\n\n463\n00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:08.080\nThere are some like little idiosyncrasies\nor nuances like the fact that we've\n\n464\n00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:12.800\nalready, me and you have already\ntalked and JD joins, or JD, I'm JD.\n\n465\n00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:17.760\nJT joins in, we may have to repeat\nourselves before using chat.\n\n466\n00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:22.520\nSo that's kind of odd, but it does other\nthan a little bit of latency for updates.\n\n467\n00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.960\nSo I've moved,\n\n468\n00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:28.150\nI tried to move really fast to see\nhow fast it made a bunch of changes.\n\n469\n00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:34.000\nSo just be aware that there is gonna be\na delay, right, it is near real time.\n\n470\n00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.890\nBut it's a lot faster than going,\nlet me save this on a thumb drive and\n\n471\n00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:38.170\nhand this to you, right?\n\n472\n00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:41.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely,\nlike the older way of doing things.\n\n473\n00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.136\nAnd so, that's pretty cool.\n\n474\n00:26:43.136 --> 00:26:49.581\nI do appreciate Microsoft kind of coming\ninto the party, cuz this is not new,\n\n475\n00:26:49.581 --> 00:26:54.856\nnecessarily in Google Docs and\nsome other types of platforms.\n\n476\n00:26:54.856 --> 00:26:58.833\nBut it's nicer they are integrating it\nright into their local or third versions\n\n477\n00:26:58.833 --> 00:27:02.690\nof their products and you don't have\nto only use the online versions.\n\n478\n00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:06.770\nA few last things before we go ahead and\nwrap this one up.\n\n479\n00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:10.800\nWhen you do share a document,\nyou have what's known as version history.\n\n480\n00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:15.360\nLet me show you really quickly because we\nhave a whole episode on version history,\n\n481\n00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:18.100\nbecause there's some fun things\nto talk about with that too.\n\n482\n00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:21.850\nIf you look up here,\nnext to the share button,\n\n483\n00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:24.870\nthere's this little like\nclock looking thing.\n\n484\n00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:27.780\nAnd when I look at this clock,\nits version history.\n\n485\n00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:31.103\nNow, you're very familiar\nwith this Justin,\n\n486\n00:27:31.103 --> 00:27:36.430\nas a version control using is it GitHub,\nand just all sorts of coding stuff.\n\n487\n00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:39.400\nI know all,\nyou guys talk about it all day long.\n\n488\n00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.470\nDo you mind giving us a quick synopsis?\n\n489\n00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:46.280\n&gt;&gt; Well, for those I actually get to make\na decision of when I take a snapshot,\n\n490\n00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:51.490\nwhen do I update, where things are,\nlike what versions to save effectively.\n\n491\n00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:55.090\nHowever, I'm not seeing that here.\n\n492\n00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:56.410\nThat's kind of weird.\n\n493\n00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:59.703\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're gonna give you a little\nbit more information on what Justin's\n\n494\n00:27:59.703 --> 00:28:00.430\ntalking about.\n\n495\n00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:05.559\nBut in a sense what you're saying is,\nyou get to take snapshots as to where\n\n496\n00:28:05.559 --> 00:28:11.130\nyou are at in the progression of your\ncoding or in this case, our Excel editing.\n\n497\n00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:16.041\nSo you can see that hey Justin saved\nthe file, Justin Timberlake shared it,\n\n498\n00:28:16.041 --> 00:28:20.873\nJustin at ITProTV saved the file because\nhe is on the online version, and so\n\n499\n00:28:20.873 --> 00:28:24.346\nonline goes ahead and\ndoes automatic saving as well.\n\n500\n00:28:24.346 --> 00:28:29.138\nSo it is keeping track and\ntimestamping version history,\n\n501\n00:28:29.138 --> 00:28:33.652\njust like we did our episode\non track changes, right?\n\n502\n00:28:33.652 --> 00:28:37.914\nThe difference here, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE]\n\n503\n00:28:37.914 --> 00:28:39.981\nExactly.\n\n504\n00:28:39.981 --> 00:28:43.726\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, we're giving Tanisha a run for\n\n505\n00:28:43.726 --> 00:28:47.303\nher money today of like flipping back and\nforth and behind my head and\n\n506\n00:28:47.303 --> 00:28:50.410\neverything so,\nthat's why she is captain awesome.\n\n507\n00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:54.495\nSo anyway, you can see that the,\nthe versioning,\n\n508\n00:28:54.495 --> 00:28:57.535\nwe'll tell you more about it, okay.\n\n509\n00:28:57.535 --> 00:28:59.690\nIt can get a little weird.\n\n510\n00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:03.050\nIt's great and everything but\nanyways, more to come.\n\n511\n00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:06.990\nSo everything's working pretty well so\nfar, right?\n\n512\n00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:10.840\nWe initiated the share,\nI uploaded it, I invited you,\n\n513\n00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:13.260\nwe saw as a recipient you got an email.\n\n514\n00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:16.370\nWe're talking to each other, and\n\n515\n00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:21.970\nthere's a few more things that we need to\ndiscuss, in a sense of troubleshooting.\n\n516\n00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:25.240\nSome little caveats, so we're going to\n\n517\n00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:30.160\ntake some more time in another\nepisode to tell you all about it.\n\n518\n00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:33.010\n&gt;&gt; Well hopefully,\nyou've listened as we've collaborated.\n\n519\n00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:37.635\nYou have to come on back to hear about\nall the troubleshooting funniness that\n\n520\n00:29:37.635 --> 00:29:39.090\nwe're gonna get into.\n\n521\n00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:41.710\nAnd well, sometimes that's like 90% of\n\n522\n00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:45.500\nthe work that you have to do is figuring\nout how to navigate those weird waters.\n\n523\n00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:46.510\nSo definitely come on back.\n\n524\n00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:48.070\nBut for now, we are going to go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n525\n00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:50.808\nSo signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n526\n00:29:50.808 --> 00:29:53.167\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n527\n00:29:53.167 --> 00:29:53.667\n[SOUND]\n\n",

exciting\nepisode Episode of OfficePro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.971 --> 00:00:19.390\nI'm you host Justin Dennison, and boy,\ndo we have a doozy in store for you.\n\n5\n00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.580\nWe're gonna be looking at co-authoring,\n\n6\n00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.150\nand well, specifically we're gonna be\ndoing some troubleshooting, right?\n\n7\n00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.430\nThose are things that\nyou will need to know.\n\n8\n00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.949\nNow this is part of our Excel 2016 advance\nfor Mac series, and well we have our\n\n9\n00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.487\nvery own Excel queen to help us through\nall these pitfalls that we may encounter.\n\n10\n00:00:35.487 --> 00:00:36.040\nMiss Vonne Smith.\n\n11\n00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.792\nHow you doing today Vonne?\n\n12\n00:00:36.792 --> 00:00:40.560\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing pretty good today.\n\n13\n00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.146\nNot in my usual, hey this is amazing.\n\n14\n00:00:43.146 --> 00:00:46.433\nBecause, I'll be honest\nwith you guys out there,\n\n15\n00:00:46.433 --> 00:00:52.150\nI feel like we know each other a little\nbit, you've probably watched me a lot.\n\n16\n00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.890\nI'm gonna cut to it straight,\nI've been feeling a little bad, okay?\n\n17\n00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.850\nI've been feeling kind of almost guilty\nabout me not really like selling\n\n18\n00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.470\ny'all on this co-authoring thing in Excel\nfor Mac and saying, do it, it's amazing.\n\n19\n00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.290\nSo I'm feeling a little\nguilty there Justin,\n\n20\n00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.850\nwe were talking about this off camera.\n\n21\n00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.510\n&gt;&gt; We were talking about it off camera and\n\n22\n00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.910\nI said,\nthere's no reason to feel guilty, right?\n\n23\n00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.160\nI would rather you give me a real talk and\ntell me what to prepare for,\n\n24\n00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.065\nthan necessarily sugar coat everything and\nme go, well that's not right.\n\n25\n00:01:26.065 --> 00:01:29.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So maybe I'm the edge case but\n\n26\n00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.880\nI would rather you go,\nlisten there's some pitfalls here.\n\n27\n00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.280\nThis is good, but there are some\nother things that aren't so good.\n\n28\n00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.304\n&gt;&gt; And,\nthat's exactly where I'm with this.\n\n29\n00:01:39.304 --> 00:01:43.172\nAnd, that's why I wanted to make this\nepisode to tell you about the things that\n\n30\n00:01:43.172 --> 00:01:45.808\nI have encountered that have\nkind of driven me crazy,\n\n31\n00:01:45.808 --> 00:01:49.559\nit's like I can't one find documentation\nto answer my specific question,\n\n32\n00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:53.400\nI don't understand what's\ndoing it this particular way.\n\n33\n00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.260\nSo I've done a lot of\ntroubleshooting on own.\n\n34\n00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.550\nCame up with some things that I\nfelt that I was looking for, so\n\n35\n00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.135\nI'm going to give it to you and\ngive it to you straight.\n\n36\n00:02:05.135 --> 00:02:10.060\nCo-authoring and using Cloud Services,\nit really is pretty awesome,\n\n37\n00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.290\nit does make our life a lot easier.\n\n38\n00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.480\nThe things that we just did in that\nlast episode, When it worked great,\n\n39\n00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.050\nit is great.\n\n40\n00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.040\nIt's good.\n\n41\n00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.858\nI think maybe we're both a little biased\nbecause we have used other platforms and\n\n42\n00:02:25.858 --> 00:02:33.170\nsome other kind of cloud sharing\nplatforms and Microsoft, I'd give it a B.\n\n43\n00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.923\nMaybe on how they're doing so\nfar, what would you do Justin?\n\n44\n00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:40.590\n&gt;&gt; I think Vonne, full disclosure.\n\n45\n00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.828\nThis is bias,\nthis is totally opinion base.\n\n46\n00:02:42.828 --> 00:02:47.196\nYou may find that it works for\nyou beyond your wildest dreams, but for\n\n47\n00:02:47.196 --> 00:02:48.777\nmy particular use case,\n\n48\n00:02:48.777 --> 00:02:53.773\nI don't need a great deal of some of\nthe features that they're implementing.\n\n49\n00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:58.840\nAnd as a result, when I see them I'm like,\nthat's not how I would do that.\n\n50\n00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.920\nAnd this is totally\nbased on my experience.\n\n51\n00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.481\nMost generous, a B-.\n\n52\n00:03:05.481 --> 00:03:06.573\n&gt;&gt; Okay, okay.\n\n53\n00:03:06.573 --> 00:03:07.666\nThat's fair, that's fair.\n\n54\n00:03:07.666 --> 00:03:12.551\nSo we're going to go through some\nthings that I wanna tell you about\n\n55\n00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:16.913\nto make your life at least\na little bit more informative when\n\n56\n00:03:16.913 --> 00:03:19.080\nit comes to collaboration.\n\n57\n00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.690\nSo we're gonna start by looking at my\nWord document as down here on my screen,\n\n58\n00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.060\nand you have access this.\n\n59\n00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.150\nI'm giving you all of my notes and\nit is kinda like in a my own talk,\n\n60\n00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.820\nsome kind of talk into myself to be able\nto talk to you, so there's things that I\n\n61\n00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:41.420\nfeel have come up that have\nreally kind of thrown me off.\n\n62\n00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.990\nWho can do co-authoring, and\n\n63\n00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:48.740\nreally more when I say who it's kind of\nmore on like this particular on line four.\n\n64\n00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:55.360\nThe local versus online, versus PC\nversus Mac, and owners versus recipient.\n\n65\n00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:01.260\nThat's a lot, and depending on what side\nof the fence you're on, it's different.\n\n66\n00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.360\nIt is not the same across the board.\n\n67\n00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.354\nAnd it can be a little weird, okay?\n\n68\n00:04:07.354 --> 00:04:12.216\nSo they're like, yes, look we went\nahead and added co-authoring and\n\n69\n00:04:12.216 --> 00:04:18.471\nbeing able to share directly through Excel\nonline, everything's fine, kind of, okay?\n\n70\n00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.190\nAnd then, what about if I\nneeded to open the file again?\n\n71\n00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.070\nOkay, because we did it, right?\n\n72\n00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.580\nWe went ahead and you got the email.\n\n73\n00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.830\nWe did that for that one session,\n\n74\n00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.060\nwhat is this is a file that we're gonna\nbe working on consistently, okay?\n\n75\n00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.710\nHow do I get back to that file,\nwhere is it?\n\n76\n00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.903\nHow do I control all of this?\n\n77\n00:04:37.903 --> 00:04:42.780\nThose are the kind of loose ends that I\nfeel when you read this, kind of like a,\n\n78\n00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.510\nfor lack of better terms, like PR, promo\nstuff that Microsoft puts out for you.\n\n79\n00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.183\nFantastic, but\nit doesn't answer all my questions.\n\n80\n00:04:51.183 --> 00:04:54.630\nSo these are the ones that I was like I\nneed to do this again, where did it go?\n\n81\n00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.518\nWhy is that not working?\n\n82\n00:04:55.518 --> 00:04:57.244\nWhy is it not letting me in?\n\n83\n00:04:57.244 --> 00:05:02.542\nAll those types of things, and\nthen why is it telling me that I can\n\n84\n00:05:02.542 --> 00:05:09.020\nedit in Excel Local when it doesn't\nallow me to edit in Excel Local install?\n\n85\n00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.960\nOkay, so why is it locking?\n\n86\n00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.080\nIt says your not suppose to lock,\nit totally locks files, okay?\n\n87\n00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.880\nAnd then what about this version\nhistory and then what about if I don't\n\n88\n00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.080\nwanna share,\nI can turn on sharing pretty easily.\n\n89\n00:05:26.112 --> 00:05:28.610\nNow, Justin's a shady dude over there, so\n\n90\n00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:34.460\nI don't want him messing with my files\nanymore because he's so maniacal.\n\n91\n00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.470\nLook at that face, I mean come on now.\n\n92\n00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.610\nSo he keeps messing up my files.\n\n93\n00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.975\nI want to take him out,\noff the file, okay?\n\n94\n00:05:42.975 --> 00:05:46.331\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I was like, whoa,\nthis escalated a great deal, Vonne.\n\n95\n00:05:46.331 --> 00:05:49.460\nYou can have your files back.\n\n96\n00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.180\n&gt;&gt; So\nI need to remove sharing permissions,\n\n97\n00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.080\nthen hey Justin, you know what?\n\n98\n00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.820\nYou don't want to see my files either, so\n\n99\n00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.780\nyou want to take it off your list\nof files that you're seeing, so\n\n100\n00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.750\nyou stop seeing my name about\nChristmas cats and stuff like that.\n\n101\n00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:09.290\nSo these are all the things that\nI feel aren't fully answered,\n\n102\n00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.930\nat least in my opinion, in some of\nthe documentation that's out there.\n\n103\n00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.654\nOkay, so that's why you got me.\n\n104\n00:06:14.654 --> 00:06:16.984\nAren't you glad you signed up for\nOfficeProTV?\n\n105\n00:06:16.984 --> 00:06:20.370\n[LAUGH] So okay, so here we go.\n\n106\n00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.130\nWe're gonna go through.\n\n107\n00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.400\nI have a lot of links.\n\n108\n00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.790\nThese are a lot more, just kind of things\nlike, hey, this is what you can do.\n\n109\n00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:26.510\nThat's great.\n\n110\n00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.580\nThere's this troubleshooting article.\n\n111\n00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.220\nI'm not even gonna bring it up cuz it\ndidn't really help me at all, okay?\n\n112\n00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.520\nIt did not answer my question.\n\n113\n00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.570\nOkay, so a few things that I have noticed.\n\n114\n00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:36.980\nThat in all of this documentation,\n\n115\n00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.050\nit doesn't specifically say\nanything about Mac desktop.\n\n116\n00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.310\nYes, it says Windows desktop,\nbut it's not kinda saying hey,\n\n117\n00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.540\nthis will not work in Excel for\n\n118\n00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:51.288\nMac Desktop version even though it say's\nin the help files that it does, okay?\n\n119\n00:06:51.288 --> 00:06:55.270\nSo the online part of it, which really\nif you think about Excel online,\n\n120\n00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.290\nit's not match specific anyways is it?\n\n121\n00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.880\n&gt;&gt; No, that's the entire\nimpotence of the web platform.\n\n122\n00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.430\nI can write an app and\nif I can get it to work and\n\n123\n00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:06.850\nideally as long as we have a similar\nbrowser set, it should work anywhere.\n\n124\n00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.890\nNow there's some edges some cases there.\n\n125\n00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:12.668\nThere are some cooperate and\ngovernment bureaucracies we're like we\n\n126\n00:07:12.668 --> 00:07:15.749\nstill use the browsers from the 90,\nno, I'm joking.\n\n127\n00:07:15.749 --> 00:07:20.499\nBut, there is some but\nsometimes you are still encountering,\n\n128\n00:07:20.499 --> 00:07:25.506\nit doesn't work like it does over here,\nit just count the name of the game.\n\n129\n00:07:25.506 --> 00:07:28.207\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yes and\nas an owner of a document,\n\n130\n00:07:28.207 --> 00:07:31.810\nyou can use the desktop to edit and\nyou get the auto-save.\n\n131\n00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:35.270\nAnd by the way, auto-save is a Mac thing,\nit's not on a PC.\n\n132\n00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.620\nBut as a recipient, no,\nyou cannot edit in your local desktop.\n\n133\n00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:39.760\nI said that in the last episode,\n\n134\n00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.300\nbut I keep emphasizing it because\nit's the one place you can't.\n\n135\n00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.065\nIt's weird, okay?\n\n136\n00:07:45.065 --> 00:07:47.530\nAnd it's as a recipient, okay?\n\n137\n00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:51.540\nAnd even though it says in OneDrive that\nyou can open an Excel, it doesn't work,\n\n138\n00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:55.680\nit crashes, and it tries to make you log\nin with the other person's credentials.\n\n139\n00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.341\nKind of weird.\n\n140\n00:07:56.341 --> 00:08:01.689\nBut as an owner, if you're using online,\nyou can edit any local or the online\n\n141\n00:08:01.689 --> 00:08:07.633\nversion, and you see a lot more stuff that\na recipient, which that I can understand.\n\n142\n00:08:07.633 --> 00:08:11.461\nAs the owner of the document,\nI'm gonna see other variables or\n\n143\n00:08:11.461 --> 00:08:15.580\ndetails of the document that you're\nnot gonna see as a recipient.\n\n144\n00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:20.200\nSo that didn't blow my mind, but you're\nlike, hey I don't see any of that stuff.\n\n145\n00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.466\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nthis is one of those weird thing.\n\n146\n00:08:22.466 --> 00:08:25.300\nIn particular this edit, right.\n\n147\n00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.670\nIf I'm the recipient.\n\n148\n00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:30.290\nSo you can't see that as\na button to launch something.\n\n149\n00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:31.980\nBut we kind of snaked around.\n\n150\n00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:32.800\nWe tried this out.\n\n151\n00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.400\nWe tried to break the system, right?\n\n152\n00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.630\nGlitch the matrix, so to speak.\n\n153\n00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:39.460\nAnd we found a way where you can click\na link that it appears that you should be\n\n154\n00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:45.920\nable to open up Excel, tell you what,\nmy local install of Excel was not happy.\n\n155\n00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:51.110\nIt was like, well, we gotta do updates and\nthen it would crash or it would close.\n\n156\n00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:54.360\nAnd I'd re-open and it was like,\nyou need to log in with your Office 365.\n\n157\n00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:58.440\nAnd I was like, I was logged in, and\nthen I tried to click it again and\n\n158\n00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.520\nthen it opened another Excel but\nthe other one was still open.\n\n159\n00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.300\nAnd I never could get it to open,\n\n160\n00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.480\neven though that was an option\nthrough the online portal, right?\n\n161\n00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.910\nThis wasn't through the shared document\nper se, but this was through OneDrive.\n\n162\n00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:16.020\nI'll tell you, we were having fun with it,\nbut if you were trying to do this in\n\n163\n00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:20.168\nan office, I would be I'd be gritting my\nteeth and kind of clenching my fists.\n\n164\n00:09:20.168 --> 00:09:25.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, it's funny cuz it sounds\nlike you're just talking in circles, but\n\n165\n00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:29.690\nI fully followed you, cuz I was sitting\nright next to you and I'm just like, what?\n\n166\n00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:30.270\nSo it was fun.\n\n167\n00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:31.717\nAnd this whole version history.\n\n168\n00:09:31.717 --> 00:09:33.866\nWe talked about, look,\nsee it's great, right?\n\n169\n00:09:33.866 --> 00:09:38.563\nThe thing is as a recipient of the shared\ndocument, you can't see version\n\n170\n00:09:38.563 --> 00:09:43.740\nhistory because version history only\nshows up in a local installation.\n\n171\n00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.760\nSo you don't have any\nof that options online.\n\n172\n00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:50.560\nBut wait,\nthat's kinda weird as a Mac user.\n\n173\n00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:55.175\n&gt;&gt; Ha, but what's interesting, if it's\nyour document, I can see the version\n\n174\n00:09:55.175 --> 00:09:59.445\nhistory on my own online documents,\nnot for recipient ones, though.\n\n175\n00:09:59.445 --> 00:10:03.070\nIt's I don't understand\nwhy you just can't see it.\n\n176\n00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:05.523\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And, if you're on a PC, okay,\n\n177\n00:10:05.523 --> 00:10:10.180\nif you're a PC user that is\na recipient of a shared document.\n\n178\n00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:15.159\nYou have the option to edit it with your\nlocal version which means you can get\n\n179\n00:10:15.159 --> 00:10:19.114\non version control, or\nversion history, and that's so,\n\n180\n00:10:19.114 --> 00:10:23.797\nthere is that whole I have an advantage\nas a PC user to be able to do that.\n\n181\n00:10:23.797 --> 00:10:28.288\n&gt;&gt; And just to be clear, I totally\nunderstand from a development stand point\n\n182\n00:10:28.288 --> 00:10:31.655\nwhy there is not necessarily\nfeature parity, right?\n\n183\n00:10:31.655 --> 00:10:36.230\nA one to one correspondence of all\nthe things that are available on Mac or\n\n184\n00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.170\non Windows or on the online platform.\n\n185\n00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:40.130\nSo that's not what we're saying.\n\n186\n00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:44.700\nIt's just you need to be aware if\nyour office is a mixed hardware, or\n\n187\n00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.770\na mixed computing system environment,\nright?\n\n188\n00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:50.518\nVonne and I are both on Macs.\n\n189\n00:10:50.518 --> 00:10:52.930\nWell, all of our feature\nsets are the same.\n\n190\n00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:54.970\nBut if we have someone else\nin the office who's on PC,\n\n191\n00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:58.690\nthen we just need to be aware\nof these things, right?\n\n192\n00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:02.470\n&gt;&gt; That right there, that hit\nthe nail on the head, because yes,\n\n193\n00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:08.790\nmost offices are going to be a mixed bag,\nWindows and Mac users.\n\n194\n00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:12.050\nAnd that's where it gets a little dicey.\n\n195\n00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:17.195\nAnd another thing, full disclosure,\nI've tried to record our\n\n196\n00:11:17.195 --> 00:11:22.450\nco-authoring episode a couple times,\nand I didn't even think to do this one.\n\n197\n00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:23.150\nLet me show you.\n\n198\n00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:28.140\nDown here on this one, All right,\nif you've already shared a workbook,\n\n199\n00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:31.960\nright, in the old sharing way,\nyou can't share it through the new share.\n\n200\n00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.529\nI know, it's so weird.\n\n201\n00:11:35.529 --> 00:11:39.335\nWe had that episode about shared\nworkbooks, and where the button was\n\n202\n00:11:39.335 --> 00:11:42.886\nmissing and we went and found it,\nand we put that permission on.\n\n203\n00:11:42.886 --> 00:11:47.248\nwell In that episode, I started recording\nthe episode and I used that file to\n\n204\n00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:51.830\ndo the uploading and there's like well\nthat didn't work and I was like gosh.\n\n205\n00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:55.863\nYeah, I mean like it makes sense\nnow that I did it and it broke.\n\n206\n00:11:55.863 --> 00:12:01.057\nIs that you are putting certain kind of\npermissions on it in the old Old shared,\n\n207\n00:12:01.057 --> 00:12:05.325\nlike I'm making it available to\npeople to do the track changes.\n\n208\n00:12:05.325 --> 00:12:08.803\nAnd then I went ahead and tried to upload\nit through OneDrive and share it, and\n\n209\n00:12:08.803 --> 00:12:12.620\nthen it's like nope, I don't understand,\nthis is like an unsupported file type.\n\n210\n00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:16.024\nAnd that's why Mike's,\nwhat do you mean unsupported stuff?\n\n211\n00:12:16.024 --> 00:12:17.960\nYeah, can't share it share.\n\n212\n00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.690\n&gt;&gt; And what was interesting about that\nis we actually encountered that error at\n\n213\n00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:22.400\ndifferent times cuz you were\ntrying to share with me.\n\n214\n00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.270\nThe email came through, it's not\nuntil we tried to open the document.\n\n215\n00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:29.790\nI actually got the error\nmessage before you did.\n\n216\n00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:33.354\n&gt;&gt; So we were on different browsers,\nand I'm trying to open it and\n\n217\n00:12:33.354 --> 00:12:35.188\nmine said absolutely not, no.\n\n218\n00:12:35.188 --> 00:12:36.862\nVonne's continued on,\n\n219\n00:12:36.862 --> 00:12:42.131\nlike everything was cool until it actually\ncame to the last part and it went no.\n\n220\n00:12:42.131 --> 00:12:43.950\nSo it was kind of a weird experience.\n\n221\n00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:45.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was, and I was just like,\n\n222\n00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:48.065\nI'm gonna add that into my\ntroubleshooting episode.\n\n223\n00:12:48.065 --> 00:12:50.050\n[LAUGH] So be careful.\n\n224\n00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:55.932\nTake your old share permissions off before\nyou try to do the other new co-authoring\n\n225\n00:12:55.932 --> 00:13:00.988\nshared through OneDrive and\nall that kind of stuff, all right, cool.\n\n226\n00:13:00.988 --> 00:13:03.948\nSo let's Kinda keep moving\ndown this document.\n\n227\n00:13:03.948 --> 00:13:06.980\nAll right, cuz I wrote this all up to\ntry to keep us on track as we go through\n\n228\n00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:07.575\nthis episode.\n\n229\n00:13:07.575 --> 00:13:10.524\nCuz we kind of bob and\nweave throughout this little bit.\n\n230\n00:13:10.524 --> 00:13:15.504\nSo now, I've closed all my files, on\neverybody's accounts, so now what about,\n\n231\n00:13:15.504 --> 00:13:18.154\nas an owner,\nhow do I open that file back up?\n\n232\n00:13:18.154 --> 00:13:23.168\nThe one that I am working with and\ncollaborating with,\n\n233\n00:13:23.168 --> 00:13:26.659\nJustin and Joey and Vonne was a owner.\n\n234\n00:13:26.659 --> 00:13:29.528\nOkay, in my desktop version,\nI can just go ahead and\n\n235\n00:13:29.528 --> 00:13:31.692\nopen it like I would in the other files.\n\n236\n00:13:31.692 --> 00:13:36.137\nSo I'm going to go to Excel,\nthis is my local installation,\n\n237\n00:13:36.137 --> 00:13:39.330\n[LAUGH] this is a strange one, right.\n\n238\n00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.646\nThis whole shared thing, okay.\n\n239\n00:13:41.646 --> 00:13:45.225\nWell [LAUGH] it didn't work before,\nguess what?\n\n240\n00:13:45.225 --> 00:13:46.505\n[LAUGH] It just did.\n\n241\n00:13:46.505 --> 00:13:49.370\n[LAUGH] All right, that's kind of funny.\n\n242\n00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:52.207\nSo this didn't work up until right now,\n\n243\n00:13:52.207 --> 00:13:58.060\nthat it actually shows that this was the\none, that I shared out with people, okay?\n\n244\n00:13:59.772 --> 00:14:03.148\nIf it's not there, okay,\npretend it's not there,\n\n245\n00:14:03.148 --> 00:14:05.560\nyou can always go to your open, okay?\n\n246\n00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:10.321\nSo just in case,\nsee it's throwing me more loops right now.\n\n247\n00:14:10.321 --> 00:14:12.460\nI'm opening it in my One Drive account.\n\n248\n00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:15.893\nThis is not saved in your computer.\n\n249\n00:14:15.893 --> 00:14:19.870\nIt's in your cloud computer, and so\nyou need to go to that particular file.\n\n250\n00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:24.370\nThere's my short, short,\n[LAUGH] sort, filter and share and\n\n251\n00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:30.260\nthen that's where I open it as an owner,\nI can see it, and everything's fine.\n\n252\n00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:34.030\nI would see people that would be logged\nin, cuz you close the document right?\n\n253\n00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:35.090\nI close the documents.\n\n254\n00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:36.777\nNobody is sharing right now.\n\n255\n00:14:36.777 --> 00:14:40.714\nBut when people start popping\nit back in if Vonne or Justin,\n\n256\n00:14:40.714 --> 00:14:45.698\nor Joey, it would do the same things\nthat we saw in the last episode, okay?\n\n257\n00:14:45.698 --> 00:14:48.340\nSo that's not too terribly hard, okay?\n\n258\n00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:52.920\nIt's in my OneDrive,\nopen it up in my OneDrive, okay, fine.\n\n259\n00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:55.592\nI'm gonna close this right now.\n\n260\n00:14:55.592 --> 00:15:00.143\nBut I've already went ahead and\nlogged into Justin's account,\n\n261\n00:15:00.143 --> 00:15:03.960\nthe Office 365 in the browser,\nI'm using Chrome.\n\n262\n00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:08.140\nOkay, so if I go over here to OneDrive,\nI could also open it this way.\n\n263\n00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.540\nI think this is a little\nbit longer way of doing it.\n\n264\n00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:15.400\nBut here are my files as Justin, and\nthen if I go to the sort and filter and\n\n265\n00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:19.450\nmy share, this is where I can do\na lot of the other stuff like I\n\n266\n00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:22.877\nwas talking about with the links and\neverything.\n\n267\n00:15:22.877 --> 00:15:24.056\nIt's still OneDrive, so\n\n268\n00:15:24.056 --> 00:15:26.875\nyou need to know how to work with\none drive a little bit as well.\n\n269\n00:15:26.875 --> 00:15:30.811\n[COUGH] Now, if I look at\nthe little dots right here, and\n\n270\n00:15:30.811 --> 00:15:35.613\nshows actions, you see I have some\ndifferent things as the owner.\n\n271\n00:15:35.613 --> 00:15:39.271\nI can see version history,\ncuz remember I said that,\n\n272\n00:15:39.271 --> 00:15:43.314\nyou can't see version history online,\nas a recipient, okay.\n\n273\n00:15:43.314 --> 00:15:46.681\nAs the owner,\nI do have the version control.\n\n274\n00:15:46.681 --> 00:15:51.994\nThere is the changes that we made,\nthe time stamps, all of that stuff, okay.\n\n275\n00:15:51.994 --> 00:15:56.468\nSo don't think it's not available online,\nonly for the owner, and\n\n276\n00:15:56.468 --> 00:15:58.566\nthen I can do some other things.\n\n277\n00:15:58.566 --> 00:16:00.134\nI get to the details, and\n\n278\n00:16:00.134 --> 00:16:04.933\nI can also get into the shared permissions\nwhich we'll come back around to.\n\n279\n00:16:04.933 --> 00:16:09.805\nBecause this is where you control who gets\nsharing permissions and who doesn't and\n\n280\n00:16:09.805 --> 00:16:11.830\nwhere you can remove them as well.\n\n281\n00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:13.350\nYou have a puzzling look over there.\n\n282\n00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:16.318\n&gt;&gt; So Vonne, I could be going crazy here.\n\n283\n00:16:16.318 --> 00:16:20.784\nSo in that version history that you just\nshowed us online, it was JT and then me,\n\n284\n00:16:20.784 --> 00:16:23.530\nbecause I made changes to the document,\nright?\n\n285\n00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:24.430\nThose are the only two.\n\n286\n00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.570\nCan you go the local one and\n\n287\n00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:28.880\nshow the version history on\nthe local one that's open?\n\n288\n00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.970\nBecause, we could get another loop here.\n\n289\n00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:35.307\nI'm pretty sure to actually\nshowed different versions.\n\n290\n00:16:35.307 --> 00:16:39.147\n&gt;&gt; Let's look, now I'm the owner,\nso when I come to here,\n\n291\n00:16:39.147 --> 00:16:45.070\nnotice I had the option of opening up\nin Excel online, or open up in Excel.\n\n292\n00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:48.340\nNow, let me just like close,\nclose Excel just so that you can see this.\n\n293\n00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:52.510\nOkay, open up in Excel,\nthis is just a Chrome thing it says hey,\n\n294\n00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:55.610\nare you sure you wanna open this\nparticular file type, and I say yes.\n\n295\n00:16:55.610 --> 00:17:02.663\nIt opens up and brings it down in\nmy local version, my local install,\n\n296\n00:17:02.663 --> 00:17:08.270\nsorry come over here to my\nversions [LAUGH] Ta ta ta ta ta.\n\n297\n00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:10.332\n[LAUGH] He's got a big\nold smile on his face.\n\n298\n00:17:10.332 --> 00:17:13.285\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So this is something to be aware of,\n\n299\n00:17:13.285 --> 00:17:13.820\nright?\n\n300\n00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:16.319\nIf these are reporting different versions,\n\n301\n00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:19.025\nnow they may reconcile\nthemselves eventually.\n\n302\n00:17:19.025 --> 00:17:24.230\nBut you need to be aware that there's\ndifferences, that could be problematic.\n\n303\n00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:28.023\nAnd what you just did, doesn't work for\nme if I'm a recipient.\n\n304\n00:17:28.023 --> 00:17:28.982\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n305\n00:17:28.982 --> 00:17:33.615\n&gt;&gt; I do love\na non-deterministic workplace.\n\n306\n00:17:33.615 --> 00:17:37.342\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, and\nlet's keep that in mind, okay, and\n\n307\n00:17:37.342 --> 00:17:41.090\nalso keep this in mind when\nwe talk a little bit more.\n\n308\n00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:43.215\nWe have a little bit more to\ntalk about with version control.\n\n309\n00:17:43.215 --> 00:17:45.210\nI keep saying version control, I'm sorry.\n\n310\n00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:49.026\nIt's version history because I\nknow there's version control,\n\n311\n00:17:49.026 --> 00:17:51.114\nfrom other places and everything.\n\n312\n00:17:51.114 --> 00:17:53.314\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n313\n00:17:53.314 --> 00:17:55.473\nBut I'm so glad that you pointed that out.\n\n314\n00:17:55.473 --> 00:17:59.181\nI'm gonna close the local version and\njust quit Excel, and\n\n315\n00:17:59.181 --> 00:18:01.340\nthen come back into my online one.\n\n316\n00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:02.090\nSo all right.\n\n317\n00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:07.191\nSo we've gone through some things and\nI've showed you as the owner Options,\n\n318\n00:18:07.191 --> 00:18:11.050\njust so you could see,\nlet's go over to my other account.\n\n319\n00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:12.810\nBecause what if you're a recipient, okay?\n\n320\n00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:16.914\nAnd this is where it get's a little weird,\nokay?\n\n321\n00:18:16.914 --> 00:18:22.198\nI'm Vonne now, no longer, JT, and\nI need to open that document again.\n\n322\n00:18:22.198 --> 00:18:25.250\nWell, if I go to,\nwe already know it doesn't work.\n\n323\n00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:26.710\nBut I'm just gonna go through the steps.\n\n324\n00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:28.770\nHere's my local Installation.\n\n325\n00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:30.347\nIt says shared.\n\n326\n00:18:30.347 --> 00:18:31.419\nPlease don't refresh.\n\n327\n00:18:31.419 --> 00:18:32.571\n[LAUGH] I almost wanted to.\n\n328\n00:18:32.571 --> 00:18:35.435\nI'm like please don't show that\nit's going to, okay, good.\n\n329\n00:18:35.435 --> 00:18:39.782\nBecause it shouldn't show up here,\nit doesn't.\n\n330\n00:18:39.782 --> 00:18:41.620\nBut remember,\nit is shared with me, isn't it?\n\n331\n00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.884\nBut it doesn't show up here.\n\n332\n00:18:43.884 --> 00:18:46.170\n&gt;&gt; But it's not, I didn't share it out.\n\n333\n00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:47.030\nI'm the recipient.\n\n334\n00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:50.230\nSo if that like the semantics\nthat followed that?\n\n335\n00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:55.900\nSo it shows up in Shared if I'm the one\nthat shared it out with other people,\n\n336\n00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:56.629\nand not.\n\n337\n00:18:56.629 --> 00:18:57.797\nThat's confusing.\n\n338\n00:18:57.797 --> 00:18:59.520\nRight, super confusing.\n\n339\n00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.321\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n[LAUGH] And that's why I was so\n\n340\n00:19:02.321 --> 00:19:07.990\nsurprised when the owner of my other,\nI'm like, wait you popped up?\n\n341\n00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:09.350\nOkay, but I was an owner, so I'm like,\n\n342\n00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:11.600\nokay I will give that one to you,\nall right?\n\n343\n00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.307\nSo that doesn't work.\n\n344\n00:19:13.307 --> 00:19:18.736\nSo let me go ahead and\nbring up my browser, okay?\n\n345\n00:19:18.736 --> 00:19:21.140\nAnd so\nI thought I had already logged into this.\n\n346\n00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:23.970\nSo Let's go ahead and get here.\n\n347\n00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:26.120\nSo this is Vonne.\n\n348\n00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:29.660\nOkay, so now I have logged into\nmy Office 365 account for me.\n\n349\n00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:33.849\nAnd I come down here, and\nif I look at Shared with me,\n\n350\n00:19:33.849 --> 00:19:36.822\nthere was a document shared with me.\n\n351\n00:19:36.822 --> 00:19:39.330\nThere's still no Office\ndocuments here either.\n\n352\n00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.490\nOkay, whatever, okay?\n\n353\n00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:45.750\nCuz I'm also thinking I don't wanna\nhave to go back to my Outlook.\n\n354\n00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:48.540\nOops, that's my trash.\n\n355\n00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:53.437\n[LAUGH] If I click here, I mean I could go\nback to the link and everything like that.\n\n356\n00:19:53.437 --> 00:19:56.632\nBut what if I've already deleted it and\nI don't wanna have to go through that?\n\n357\n00:19:56.632 --> 00:20:00.740\nWell as a recipient,\nI log into my account,\n\n358\n00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:04.078\nI go to my OneDrive, this is Vonne.\n\n359\n00:20:04.078 --> 00:20:09.947\nI go to my OneDrive account, and\nthen if I go over here to shared,\n\n360\n00:20:09.947 --> 00:20:14.645\nthis is where I will find\ndocuments shared with me.\n\n361\n00:20:14.645 --> 00:20:17.550\nYou can see I've been doing this for\na couple of times.\n\n362\n00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.897\nThere's that sort and filter share, right?\n\n363\n00:20:19.897 --> 00:20:26.634\nSo this is one way that you can open\nup a document that was shared with you,\n\n364\n00:20:26.634 --> 00:20:32.285\nas a recipient,\nthrough your OneDrive account right here.\n\n365\n00:20:32.285 --> 00:20:33.040\nSo I click at this.\n\n366\n00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.356\nNow remember those different options?\n\n367\n00:20:35.356 --> 00:20:38.706\nRight here, I don't have anything\nThat version history, do I?\n\n368\n00:20:38.706 --> 00:20:39.508\nNope, I don't get it.\n\n369\n00:20:39.508 --> 00:20:43.306\nWhich I don't necessarily\nsee as a bad thing.\n\n370\n00:20:43.306 --> 00:20:47.225\nI'm inviting you so\nyou probably shouldn't have that control.\n\n371\n00:20:48.255 --> 00:20:49.525\nKind of iffy about that one too.\n\n372\n00:20:49.525 --> 00:20:52.855\nAnd then,\nI don't have that information about it.\n\n373\n00:20:52.855 --> 00:20:53.835\nAnd okay, that's fine.\n\n374\n00:20:53.835 --> 00:20:54.676\nBut look at right here.\n\n375\n00:20:54.676 --> 00:20:59.075\nIt says I could do what Open\nup an Excel or Excel online.\n\n376\n00:20:59.075 --> 00:21:02.925\nOkay, it's not going to work.\n\n377\n00:21:02.925 --> 00:21:05.214\nIf I click on open up an Excel,\n\n378\n00:21:05.214 --> 00:21:11.094\nlet me just show you one thing that it\ntook me a couple of times before I saw it.\n\n379\n00:21:11.094 --> 00:21:13.025\nIt says like, hey, do you wanna open up?\n\n380\n00:21:13.025 --> 00:21:14.411\nThat's just a Chrome thing.\n\n381\n00:21:14.411 --> 00:21:16.025\nThat's a Chrome thing.\n\n382\n00:21:16.025 --> 00:21:19.263\nSo I get to here and it says sign in.\n\n383\n00:21:19.263 --> 00:21:21.635\nBut Justin's the man because it's\nthe same thing happened to him.\n\n384\n00:21:21.635 --> 00:21:24.655\nAnd so I started typing in\nVonne@ITProTV and I put my.\n\n385\n00:21:24.655 --> 00:21:27.305\nI'm like why doesn't it work,\nlook at this.\n\n386\n00:21:27.305 --> 00:21:28.995\nDo you see that?\n\n387\n00:21:30.725 --> 00:21:34.325\nThat's not our ITPROTV logo is it?\n\n388\n00:21:34.325 --> 00:21:37.758\nIt's the little OfficeProdemo code,\nthe little logo that I made for me and\n\n389\n00:21:37.758 --> 00:21:39.515\nRonnie for this particular company.\n\n390\n00:21:39.515 --> 00:21:43.303\nSo right away,\nthat's a given to me right now,\n\n391\n00:21:43.303 --> 00:21:47.661\nonly because I've done this\na couple of times, okay,\n\n392\n00:21:47.661 --> 00:21:53.378\nthat it's trying to sign in with\nJT's account, cuz it's JT's file.\n\n393\n00:21:53.378 --> 00:21:57.172\nSo it's trying to open up an Excel,\nbut not use me as Vonne.\n\n394\n00:21:57.172 --> 00:22:01.454\nIt's trying to use JT and\nthen if you go through the whole thing,\n\n395\n00:22:01.454 --> 00:22:04.782\nit will say,\nyou don't have access to this file,\n\n396\n00:22:04.782 --> 00:22:09.175\nand that's where it gets confusing\nof like, but I thought I did.\n\n397\n00:22:09.175 --> 00:22:12.904\nYou can't open it up in\nExcel as a recipient.\n\n398\n00:22:12.904 --> 00:22:15.735\n&gt;&gt; Vonne I'm gonna be honest with you.\n\n399\n00:22:15.735 --> 00:22:20.995\nNumber one, so what, I need to run\nupdates or something, apparently.\n\n400\n00:22:20.995 --> 00:22:23.797\nCause what I saw-\n&gt;&gt; Right there, that's it.\n\n401\n00:22:23.797 --> 00:22:27.185\n&gt;&gt; I never, I don't think I only\ngot that dialog box one time.\n\n402\n00:22:27.185 --> 00:22:30.447\nThe other times it kinda just went,\nI'm gonna close now.\n\n403\n00:22:30.447 --> 00:22:32.441\nAnd I was like, okay I guess.\n\n404\n00:22:32.441 --> 00:22:37.441\nIt was a non-reproducible thing for me.\n\n405\n00:22:37.441 --> 00:22:39.726\n&gt;&gt; And\nwhat you just said with your updates,\n\n406\n00:22:39.726 --> 00:22:43.245\nyou probably don't run updates\nnearly as much as I do.\n\n407\n00:22:43.245 --> 00:22:46.155\nBecause I'm always on the insider slow,\nand so\n\n408\n00:22:46.155 --> 00:22:48.145\nI get updates a lot more frequently.\n\n409\n00:22:48.145 --> 00:22:50.713\nSo that could be one of your factors.\n\n410\n00:22:50.713 --> 00:22:54.198\nBut, that's something,\nyou're not gonna be able to do, okay.\n\n411\n00:22:54.198 --> 00:22:57.682\nAll right, but\nI can open it up if I click on this okay.\n\n412\n00:22:57.682 --> 00:23:00.545\nLet's cross you fingers this\nis gonna actually open, okay.\n\n413\n00:23:00.545 --> 00:23:04.719\nBecause, it's working let's see.\n\n414\n00:23:06.742 --> 00:23:12.007\n[LAUGH] You all saw that I open this up,\non this account.\n\n415\n00:23:12.007 --> 00:23:14.570\nJust not even 30 minutes ago, and\n\n416\n00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:18.420\nnow it's telling me that I\ndon't options to do this.\n\n417\n00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:24.035\nSo if this happens to you,\nit happens to me, too, okay?\n\n418\n00:23:24.035 --> 00:23:26.825\nAnd I was just, but I was just working it.\n\n419\n00:23:26.825 --> 00:23:33.915\nAnd so I tried to even do a, I refresh the\nbrowser, and nope, it's still not working.\n\n420\n00:23:33.915 --> 00:23:38.555\nSo this is where it's just like, I have\nmissions, and if I switch back over to\n\n421\n00:23:39.965 --> 00:23:44.575\nJT's account, it shows that Vonne,\nhas sharing permissions.\n\n422\n00:23:44.575 --> 00:23:45.877\nIt is, I have shared it.\n\n423\n00:23:45.877 --> 00:23:50.126\nI already opened it, but\nit doesn't like me right now.\n\n424\n00:23:50.126 --> 00:23:55.585\n&gt;&gt; But if you go through the link in\nyour e-mail, it does let you open it.\n\n425\n00:23:55.585 --> 00:23:57.705\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n426\n00:23:57.705 --> 00:24:00.055\n&gt;&gt; That's kind of odd.\n\n427\n00:24:00.055 --> 00:24:03.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's where, okay, so\njust to show you this particular one,\n\n428\n00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:08.421\nthis version history, cuz this is the file\nthat we're going to do some demonstrations\n\n429\n00:24:08.421 --> 00:24:12.439\non with the version history, it should,\nthat one doesn't let me in either.\n\n430\n00:24:12.439 --> 00:24:14.265\nI was just using this this morning.\n\n431\n00:24:14.265 --> 00:24:18.135\nOkay, so somehow,\nI've gotten kicked off the list somehow.\n\n432\n00:24:18.135 --> 00:24:20.995\nOkay, but let's come back over here.\n\n433\n00:24:20.995 --> 00:24:24.035\nRemember, you just said we'll\ngo back to the link, okay?\n\n434\n00:24:24.035 --> 00:24:28.725\nSo here is the sort and\nfilter, same thing we did.\n\n435\n00:24:28.725 --> 00:24:29.565\nSo if I click on it.\n\n436\n00:24:29.565 --> 00:24:35.765\nI'm gonna get a verification code,\nsend me a code.\n\n437\n00:24:35.765 --> 00:24:41.295\nSo it's like I had to\nredo the authentication.\n\n438\n00:24:41.295 --> 00:24:46.189\nI had to redo the verification code,\nif I switch back over to here.\n\n439\n00:24:46.189 --> 00:24:50.835\nI can still get in,\nokay, and you know what?\n\n440\n00:24:50.835 --> 00:24:52.855\nYou know what guys,\nmaybe it's my computer.\n\n441\n00:24:52.855 --> 00:24:54.050\nMaybe it's my settings.\n\n442\n00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:55.337\nYou didn't have this problem.\n\n443\n00:24:55.337 --> 00:24:59.622\nYou know what,\nmaybe It just doesn't like me this week.\n\n444\n00:24:59.622 --> 00:25:03.604\nI don't know, but\nif I come back over here and I verify it.\n\n445\n00:25:03.604 --> 00:25:06.745\nLet's just go, and now, there you go.\n\n446\n00:25:06.745 --> 00:25:10.225\nI got it.\n&gt;&gt; You wanna hear something crazy, Vonne?\n\n447\n00:25:10.225 --> 00:25:15.416\nSo I went to my OneDrive into my shared,\nand I opened that same file.\n\n448\n00:25:15.416 --> 00:25:16.416\nI didn't get the error.\n\n449\n00:25:16.416 --> 00:25:17.616\n&gt;&gt; You got right in.\n\n450\n00:25:17.616 --> 00:25:19.075\n&gt;&gt; It went directly in.\n\n451\n00:25:19.075 --> 00:25:19.972\nI'm looking at the file.\n\n452\n00:25:21.397 --> 00:25:27.011\n&gt;&gt; Maybe it's because I have multiple\naccounts on this particular Mac Book,\n\n453\n00:25:27.011 --> 00:25:27.554\nokay?\n\n454\n00:25:27.554 --> 00:25:33.202\nMaybe because I access this\nparticular account on both sides.\n\n455\n00:25:33.202 --> 00:25:37.245\nMaybe it's cuz I logged into this\naccount on my other computer.\n\n456\n00:25:37.245 --> 00:25:42.615\nI mean, I can't tell you honestly\nwhy mine's totally broken and\n\n457\n00:25:42.615 --> 00:25:44.015\nwhy Justin got in just fine.\n\n458\n00:25:44.015 --> 00:25:45.930\nIt just likes Justin better\nthan me right now, okay.\n\n459\n00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:50.780\nBut these are different things,\nbecause I am special because I do\n\n460\n00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:55.454\nuse these accounts on multiple\ndevices at multiple times, and\n\n461\n00:25:55.454 --> 00:26:00.060\nmaybe it just got, I don't know,\njust kind of kicked me out.\n\n462\n00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.750\n&gt;&gt; But on a follow up note,\nif I go back to my email and\n\n463\n00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:06.709\nclick the link that was shared to me,\nI don't get a verification code.\n\n464\n00:26:06.709 --> 00:26:07.830\n&gt;&gt; You never got the verification code.\n\n465\n00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:09.625\n&gt;&gt; And I still don't get it.\n\n466\n00:26:09.625 --> 00:26:14.230\nSo maybe it is something where it's like\na persistent history but this account,\n\n467\n00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:18.969\nyour actual Apple account, you haven't\nreally like, I mean I've been with you,\n\n468\n00:26:18.969 --> 00:26:22.691\nyou haven't really like logged out and\nin, or anything else, so\n\n469\n00:26:22.691 --> 00:26:24.544\nI don't know what's going on.\n\n470\n00:26:24.544 --> 00:26:26.883\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nthese are things that you might run into.\n\n471\n00:26:26.883 --> 00:26:30.035\nWhere people like, hey,\nit's not letting me in.\n\n472\n00:26:30.035 --> 00:26:36.025\nI'm like, well, I got to shared and\nwell, go ahead and go back to the email.\n\n473\n00:26:36.025 --> 00:26:38.725\nI already deleted that and\nI even like throw out the trash.\n\n474\n00:26:38.725 --> 00:26:40.451\nIt's not even like my deleted items.\n\n475\n00:26:40.451 --> 00:26:41.715\nI don't have it any more.\n\n476\n00:26:41.715 --> 00:26:47.182\nSo as the owner,\nI would need to send them that link again.\n\n477\n00:26:47.182 --> 00:26:51.502\nOkay, and actually, that being said, let's\njust kinda come back to I do see time that\n\n478\n00:26:51.502 --> 00:26:55.126\nthere's so much troubleshooting we're\ngonna have to make to part two.\n\n479\n00:26:55.126 --> 00:26:59.377\n[LAUGH] But if I go back over\nto the Officeprodemo core,\n\n480\n00:26:59.377 --> 00:27:04.585\nremember this is JT as the owner of\nthis in my JT One Drive account.\n\n481\n00:27:04.585 --> 00:27:07.305\nWhere it says sort and filter share.\n\n482\n00:27:07.305 --> 00:27:11.005\nAnd I come over here to the shared,\nand this is gonna be behind my head.\n\n483\n00:27:11.005 --> 00:27:14.595\nThere's a bunch of stuff over here\nthat's going to tell me as the owner,\n\n484\n00:27:14.595 --> 00:27:16.835\nwho this is shared with, who has access.\n\n485\n00:27:16.835 --> 00:27:23.825\nAnd if I hover over this, there's you,\nand it's shared with Vonne, right?\n\n486\n00:27:23.825 --> 00:27:28.815\nSo if Vonne, I feel so weird talking about\nmyself like this, if Vonne is calling JT,\n\n487\n00:27:28.815 --> 00:27:31.425\nwhich would be awesome, and\n\n488\n00:27:31.425 --> 00:27:34.875\nsaid, no, I can't open the file,\nand you're like, nope.\n\n489\n00:27:34.875 --> 00:27:35.675\nYou've got access.\n\n490\n00:27:35.675 --> 00:27:38.455\nI don't understand what's going on.\n\n491\n00:27:38.455 --> 00:27:43.535\nThis is where it can be a little weird,\nbut notice that there are options.\n\n492\n00:27:43.535 --> 00:27:45.733\nRemember we said about the links.\n\n493\n00:27:45.733 --> 00:27:48.050\nDon't do it through Excel cuz\nit can get kind of weird, and\n\n494\n00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:49.435\nwe did all this troubleshooting.\n\n495\n00:27:49.435 --> 00:27:51.765\nWe're like, it doesn't give\nyou the same link every time.\n\n496\n00:27:51.765 --> 00:27:52.895\nIt's not the same one.\n\n497\n00:27:52.895 --> 00:27:54.065\nWhy are you doing this, Microsoft.\n\n498\n00:27:54.065 --> 00:27:54.835\nThis is so weird.\n\n499\n00:27:55.955 --> 00:28:00.475\nYou could try to go ahead and\ngive them this link and\n\n500\n00:28:00.475 --> 00:28:03.945\nthen I could slack or chat or whatever.\n\n501\n00:28:03.945 --> 00:28:07.415\nI could send this link to Von, again,\n\n502\n00:28:07.415 --> 00:28:12.205\nand hopefully she would be\nable to open it back up.\n\n503\n00:28:12.205 --> 00:28:17.445\nBut maybe as a recipient, as a backup,\ndon't delete your e-mails that\n\n504\n00:28:17.445 --> 00:28:20.865\npeople are giving to you that says\nlike I am sharing the file with you.\n\n505\n00:28:20.865 --> 00:28:21.395\nKeep them.\n\n506\n00:28:21.395 --> 00:28:25.558\nDon't, like put them in a folder or\nsomething like that, because it seems\n\n507\n00:28:25.558 --> 00:28:29.654\nto be kind of a, I don't wanna say\nthe only, but a consistent back up of all\n\n508\n00:28:29.654 --> 00:28:33.750\nmy trouble shootings, of at least me\nbeing able to get back into the file,\n\n509\n00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:38.081\nregardless if I get a verification code,\nor I break the link or what have you.\n\n510\n00:28:38.081 --> 00:28:40.602\nIt seems to correct itself.\n\n511\n00:28:40.602 --> 00:28:44.395\nSo that's a lot, isn't it, Justin?\n\n512\n00:28:44.395 --> 00:28:48.685\n&gt;&gt; Well Vonne, that is a lot,\nand it's kind of an odd thing.\n\n513\n00:28:48.685 --> 00:28:50.593\nI got some ideas, but you know, Vonne,\n\n514\n00:28:50.593 --> 00:28:53.627\nI think we're gonna have to talk\nabout that between episodes and\n\n515\n00:28:53.627 --> 00:28:56.619\ncome on back with a part two,\ncuz we are definitely out of time.\n\n516\n00:28:56.619 --> 00:28:57.845\nBut definitely join us on back.\n\n517\n00:28:57.845 --> 00:29:01.643\nWe got more troublehsooting with\nco-authoring and various other things.\n\n518\n00:29:01.643 --> 00:29:02.905\nSo definitely stay tuned.\n\n519\n00:29:02.905 --> 00:29:04.255\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n520\n00:29:04.255 --> 00:29:07.035\nSo signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n521\n00:29:07.035 --> 00:29:07.675\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n522\n00:29:07.675 --> 00:29:09.419\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n523\n00:29:09.419 --> 00:29:14.871\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.495 --> 00:00:19.243\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and\nwell we're back with a part two on our\n\n4\n00:00:19.243 --> 00:00:22.880\ntroubleshooting kind of a,\nwell I guess it's kind of a mini series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.945\nI don't know.\n\n6\n00:00:23.945 --> 00:00:25.171\nThere's a lot going on here and\n\n7\n00:00:25.171 --> 00:00:28.012\nwell if you haven't checked out part\none definitely go check that out.\n\n8\n00:00:28.012 --> 00:00:31.974\nThere's some nice information about\nsome of the indeterminism that we\n\n9\n00:00:31.974 --> 00:00:32.904\ncan encounter.\n\n10\n00:00:32.904 --> 00:00:37.041\nAnd well to help us carry along in this\npart two is well, Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n11\n00:00:37.041 --> 00:00:37.823\nHow you doing today, Vonne?\n\n12\n00:00:37.823 --> 00:00:38.864\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I came back.\n\n13\n00:00:38.864 --> 00:00:44.359\n[LAUGH] I I didn't run away in\nfear from this collaborating and\n\n14\n00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:49.003\ncoauthoring, but yeah,\nit can get a little dicy.\n\n15\n00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:52.913\nMaybe we're continuing our\nadventures in coauthoring, yeah.\n\n16\n00:00:52.913 --> 00:00:58.285\nSo we left off with me as Vonne,\nthe recipient of a shared file and you\n\n17\n00:00:58.285 --> 00:01:04.244\nsaw where [LAUGH] it just stopped giving\nme access and it was really strange.\n\n18\n00:01:04.244 --> 00:01:06.783\nWe went back over to JT,\nbut I still had access.\n\n19\n00:01:06.783 --> 00:01:08.823\n[SOUND] It was a mess.\n\n20\n00:01:08.823 --> 00:01:12.118\nBut one thing I didn't\nmention on that is hey,\n\n21\n00:01:12.118 --> 00:01:16.990\nwhat if I as a recipient,\nI can't access that file anymore.\n\n22\n00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.857\nIt totally could be that\nthe owner removed my permissions.\n\n23\n00:01:21.857 --> 00:01:25.212\nIt's just like nope,\nyou don't have access to that, but\n\n24\n00:01:25.212 --> 00:01:27.272\nit would give me a different error.\n\n25\n00:01:27.272 --> 00:01:30.591\nI just thought of that,\nnow that, [LAUGH] I said that.\n\n26\n00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:31.502\nLet me show you, okay.\n\n27\n00:01:31.502 --> 00:01:33.425\nLet's come down here and\n\n28\n00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:38.652\nyou can see that I'm back on my\nVonne Smith account, my other side.\n\n29\n00:01:38.652 --> 00:01:41.041\nI'm in my Vonne@ITPro.TV account and\n\n30\n00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:44.490\nthese are the files that are shared\nwith me in my One Drive.\n\n31\n00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.333\nThis one, Christmas cat share co-author.\n\n32\n00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:52.987\nI know that I took that out,\nas Justin Timberlake,\n\n33\n00:01:52.987 --> 00:01:56.137\nI stopped sharing and removed it.\n\n34\n00:01:56.137 --> 00:01:59.249\nI just deleted it out of\nJustin Timberlake's One Drive account.\n\n35\n00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:04.375\nIf I click on this one, that's\ncompletely a different error isn't it?\n\n36\n00:02:04.375 --> 00:02:07.169\nIt's just like does not exist.\n\n37\n00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:12.100\nThe other error I got, which,\nlet's see if, maybe it'll l break.\n\n38\n00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.560\nWell, now it decided to work on me.\n\n39\n00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.755\nOkay, maybe it's cuz I\ndid that verification, so\n\n40\n00:02:16.755 --> 00:02:18.774\nall my files are working again.\n\n41\n00:02:18.774 --> 00:02:23.930\n[SOUND] Whatever, but\nthat error that I got here.\n\n42\n00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.987\nI actually took a screenshot of it so\n\n43\n00:02:25.987 --> 00:02:28.742\nyou guys could remember\nwhat it was right here.\n\n44\n00:02:28.742 --> 00:02:31.844\nThis particular file was\nlike nope it didn't work.\n\n45\n00:02:31.844 --> 00:02:35.227\nOkay the sign in part didn't work in.\n\n46\n00:02:35.227 --> 00:02:38.992\nSo okay, that could be an issue.\n\n47\n00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:41.320\nBut no it's not because it's\na different error, okay.\n\n48\n00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.508\nSo, just go ahead and\nmix what I just said there.\n\n49\n00:02:44.508 --> 00:02:46.640\n[LAUGH] You will get a different error.\n\n50\n00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.211\nOkay, but anyways,\n\n51\n00:02:48.211 --> 00:02:54.162\none other side note while I'm here that\nkinda threw me off in the online version.\n\n52\n00:02:54.162 --> 00:02:57.152\nI'm using Chrome, okay, for my browser.\n\n53\n00:02:57.152 --> 00:03:01.740\nWhen you start with an Apple,\nwhat is this thing called?\n\n54\n00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:02.321\n&gt;&gt; Track pad.\n\n55\n00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:03.470\n&gt;&gt; Track pad and laptop.\n\n56\n00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.252\nYeah, I'm like this thing\nthat I'm using it's a laptop.\n\n57\n00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:09.963\nI used two fingers as\nthe gestures to move up and\n\n58\n00:03:09.963 --> 00:03:13.610\ndown within this particular document.\n\n59\n00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.446\nWell in the browser if I do two fingers\nswipe to the left to try to move left.\n\n60\n00:03:18.446 --> 00:03:19.578\nWhat am I doing?\n\n61\n00:03:19.578 --> 00:03:21.152\nI'm going backwards in my history.\n\n62\n00:03:21.152 --> 00:03:24.322\nSo that, I did it six times.\n\n63\n00:03:24.322 --> 00:03:28.844\nI'm like stop, and so\nI had to try to keep reminding myself,\n\n64\n00:03:28.844 --> 00:03:33.490\nlittle things but\nenough to kind of get me a little twisted.\n\n65\n00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.796\nAnd a little upset too.\n\n66\n00:03:35.796 --> 00:03:40.795\nSo be careful about the two finger swipe\ngesture on your track pad within your\n\n67\n00:03:40.795 --> 00:03:42.820\nMacintosh computer.\n\n68\n00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.176\nOkay, cool.\n\n69\n00:03:44.176 --> 00:03:49.277\nLet's come back over to our other login,\nour Office Pro Demo co\n\n70\n00:03:49.277 --> 00:03:54.580\nto get back on this side,\nbecause while this is a Mac show, okay.\n\n71\n00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:00.577\n[LAUGH] I wanted to show you some\nthings about the PC world, okay.\n\n72\n00:04:00.577 --> 00:04:01.781\nAnd let's do one more thing.\n\n73\n00:04:01.781 --> 00:04:06.112\nSorry, let me switch back over\nhere I'm going to as the owner,\n\n74\n00:04:06.112 --> 00:04:11.290\nas Justin Timberlake I am going to open\nthis in Excel, like regular Excel.\n\n75\n00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.600\nAnd also it should show that Vonne\nis editing this document as well.\n\n76\n00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.462\nSo we have multiple people accessing\nthis particular file right now.\n\n77\n00:04:24.462 --> 00:04:26.773\nOkay, well, it's not showing it for\nVonne but that's okay.\n\n78\n00:04:26.773 --> 00:04:30.638\nWe know that Justin Timberlake\nhas this open in Mac.\n\n79\n00:04:30.638 --> 00:04:33.117\nSwitching over here,\nnow this is my virtual machine.\n\n80\n00:04:33.117 --> 00:04:36.835\nSo I just did a moving on over to Joey.\n\n81\n00:04:36.835 --> 00:04:40.250\nNotice I am working in\na Windows computer right now.\n\n82\n00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.467\nAnd so here is my Windows,\nthis is the email that Joey got,\n\n83\n00:04:43.467 --> 00:04:46.036\nI already opened up his email and\neverything.\n\n84\n00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:49.691\nSo we'll go ahead and open this file.\n\n85\n00:04:49.691 --> 00:04:53.791\nNow, this is Edge, so\nthis is the browser that Joey is using.\n\n86\n00:04:53.791 --> 00:04:58.685\nIt opens up in the browser, but notice\nover here you get some options of either\n\n87\n00:04:58.685 --> 00:05:01.943\nediting in the browser or\nthe full version, okay?\n\n88\n00:05:01.943 --> 00:05:05.500\nBut it's PC, so we can understand that.\n\n89\n00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.218\nI'm gonna go ahead and say, I wanna\nuse the full functionality of Excel.\n\n90\n00:05:09.218 --> 00:05:12.643\nSo I'll click on this, and\nI'll go through and open up Excel,\n\n91\n00:05:12.643 --> 00:05:16.781\nwhich is also all of the Office products\nare logged in as Joey's account, so\n\n92\n00:05:16.781 --> 00:05:19.390\neverything should be working seamlessly.\n\n93\n00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.659\nSo notice down here I am in Excel itself.\n\n94\n00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:25.620\nSo I edit the workbook cuz\nthat's just a normal thing and\n\n95\n00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.010\nthen look at what it says.\n\n96\n00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:33.904\nNope, you can't,\nbecause Justin Timberlake is editing it.\n\n97\n00:05:33.904 --> 00:05:36.443\nBut I thought this was\na collaboration tool.\n\n98\n00:05:36.443 --> 00:05:41.623\n[LAUGH] And I thought that we could\ngo ahead and all work in real time.\n\n99\n00:05:41.623 --> 00:05:44.366\nIt doesn't seem to like it for\nsome reason, okay?\n\n100\n00:05:44.366 --> 00:05:47.593\nThe time of this recording, okay,\n\n101\n00:05:47.593 --> 00:05:52.542\nit seems that if Justin Timberlake\nhas this file opened\n\n102\n00:05:52.542 --> 00:05:57.598\nup in his version of\nLocal Desktop Excel for Mac, Joey,\n\n103\n00:05:57.598 --> 00:06:04.300\nhere over on the PC side,\ncan't open it because it's locked.\n\n104\n00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.103\nKind of defeats the whole point of\nsharing, doesn't it there, Justin?\n\n105\n00:06:07.103 --> 00:06:11.042\n&gt;&gt; It almost seems like it's falling\nback to the old shared model where you\n\n106\n00:06:11.042 --> 00:06:13.799\nhad a shared network drive\nlike it's all local and\n\n107\n00:06:13.799 --> 00:06:15.980\nthen if you had it open I can't open it.\n\n108\n00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.603\nAnd there could be a variety of reasons,\nthe operating system is locking the file\n\n109\n00:06:19.603 --> 00:06:22.818\nbecause you don't want to have two\npeople writing, cuz that is crazy.\n\n110\n00:06:22.818 --> 00:06:28.218\nBut this should actually be through\nthe collaboration editing platform, right?\n\n111\n00:06:28.218 --> 00:06:30.927\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like in the cloud and everything.\n\n112\n00:06:30.927 --> 00:06:35.592\nThis is just another one of those,\nokay, mixed office use.\n\n113\n00:06:35.592 --> 00:06:39.230\nWe have PC and Mac users,\nand all that kind of stuff.\n\n114\n00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.130\nSo it's like, I don't understand.\n\n115\n00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:45.043\nSo if I had somebody on\na PC calling me and saying,\n\n116\n00:06:45.043 --> 00:06:48.870\nI can't edit this file,\nI don't understand.\n\n117\n00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.947\nSo it's just like, well,\nno, you can't edit it here.\n\n118\n00:06:51.947 --> 00:06:55.444\nBut if I'm here in the browser,\nif I say okay,\n\n119\n00:06:55.444 --> 00:07:00.039\nnow if I open it up in here,\nnow there's no problem, right?\n\n120\n00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:04.120\nI'm opening this in the browser and\nthere's no issue, okay?\n\n121\n00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:11.338\nAnd he can type in whatever he\nwants as Joey Fatone on a PC, okay?\n\n122\n00:07:11.338 --> 00:07:14.194\nAgain, isn't that kind\nof a strange caveat?\n\n123\n00:07:14.194 --> 00:07:16.741\nA weird-\n&gt;&gt; To some extent this makes sense\n\n124\n00:07:16.741 --> 00:07:20.032\nof why the Mac version doesn't work for\nthis corresponding.\n\n125\n00:07:20.032 --> 00:07:21.625\nYou've got some weirdness going on,\n\n126\n00:07:21.625 --> 00:07:24.880\nit's like no you need to log in as this\nperson as they're currently editing.\n\n127\n00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.240\nThere's a lot going on.\n\n128\n00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.881\nBut it almost seems like the underlying\nimplementation details is,\n\n129\n00:07:30.881 --> 00:07:34.080\nif you have it in a local\ninstallation verses in the browser,\n\n130\n00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.674\nthey're actually using\ntwo different things.\n\n131\n00:07:36.674 --> 00:07:38.785\nTotal guess work here.\n\n132\n00:07:38.785 --> 00:07:44.808\n&gt;&gt; But switching back over and\nI'm following what you're putting down but\n\n133\n00:07:44.808 --> 00:07:49.950\nback over here as JT,\nhe's in his local version on a self Mac.\n\n134\n00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:53.162\nSo I don't know if it's a Mac PC thing.\n\n135\n00:07:53.162 --> 00:07:57.929\nI don't particularly know but\nsince this is a Mac show and\n\n136\n00:07:57.929 --> 00:08:00.609\nyou got somebody on the PC side,\n\n137\n00:08:00.609 --> 00:08:05.596\nthey should only edit in\nthe browser as a recipient, okay?\n\n138\n00:08:07.868 --> 00:08:11.656\nOkay, see, these are the things\nI kept running into and like,\n\n139\n00:08:11.656 --> 00:08:13.242\nwhy isn't this working?\n\n140\n00:08:13.242 --> 00:08:18.213\nAnd letting you know that it\ncould be a potential problem.\n\n141\n00:08:18.213 --> 00:08:23.076\nAnd we were talking about this\noff camera about this is at\n\n142\n00:08:23.076 --> 00:08:28.469\nthe time of the recording\nright now of April 19th 2018.\n\n143\n00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:31.179\nIt could be that they fixed\nsome of these things.\n\n144\n00:08:31.179 --> 00:08:35.293\nThis is the whole reason why you have an\nOffice 365 account is that they go ahead\n\n145\n00:08:35.293 --> 00:08:36.830\nand do those patch updates.\n\n146\n00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:40.102\nAnd they go ahead and fix little things,\nand they had a new feature but\n\n147\n00:08:40.102 --> 00:08:43.502\nthen it kind of broke and so they have\nto go ahead and fix it back up again.\n\n148\n00:08:43.502 --> 00:08:47.207\nSo it might be that all of\nthis kinda gets worked on and\n\n149\n00:08:47.207 --> 00:08:50.507\nthere's no problems and\nyou can edit online.\n\n150\n00:08:50.507 --> 00:08:52.155\nYou can edit in the browser.\n\n151\n00:08:52.155 --> 00:08:54.272\nWell, I guess online in\nthe browser is the same thing.\n\n152\n00:08:54.272 --> 00:08:58.711\nOr locally and PC versus Mac and\nisn't it that whole like\n\n153\n00:08:58.711 --> 00:09:03.530\neverything's going to the same\nplatform type kernel?\n\n154\n00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:05.496\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure there's\nan ultimate goal there and\n\n155\n00:09:05.496 --> 00:09:07.926\nthis is probably some of\nthe pain points where you have,\n\n156\n00:09:07.926 --> 00:09:10.836\nwell number one you kind of have\ntwo different platforms, right?\n\n157\n00:09:10.836 --> 00:09:15.725\nYou have OSs Mac OS and PC, they're\ndeveloped a little bit differently.\n\n158\n00:09:15.725 --> 00:09:17.730\nYou have probably two\nteams working on them.\n\n159\n00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:18.968\nThen you have the browser team.\n\n160\n00:09:18.968 --> 00:09:20.767\nAnd then what browsers are supported.\n\n161\n00:09:20.767 --> 00:09:25.081\nEdge is probably more supported with\nfeatures than other browsers because well,\n\n162\n00:09:25.081 --> 00:09:28.970\nthey're building their own web\napplications to fit their browser.\n\n163\n00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:30.515\nThere's a lot of interplay here.\n\n164\n00:09:30.515 --> 00:09:34.770\nI'm sure as time goes on they wanna make\nthat as seamless as possible, right.\n\n165\n00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.383\nI'm sure they didn't get together and\nplan,\n\n166\n00:09:37.383 --> 00:09:40.538\nlet's make this as difficult as possible,\nall right?\n\n167\n00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:41.827\nNot even necessarily difficult,\n\n168\n00:09:41.827 --> 00:09:44.870\njust sometimes you're like,\nwell that's not what I expected.\n\n169\n00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:48.703\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I know they're working\ntowards that to where hopefully\n\n170\n00:09:48.703 --> 00:09:53.436\neverything's gonna be on the same level,\nand you don't have this PC versus MAC.\n\n171\n00:09:53.436 --> 00:09:57.490\nBut right now we're not there, okay.\n\n172\n00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:01.489\nAnd like I said, you might be watching\nthis recording right now and be like,\n\n173\n00:10:01.489 --> 00:10:03.501\nI haven't had any of these problems.\n\n174\n00:10:03.501 --> 00:10:07.800\nThey might have fixed them by then, okay,\nwhich is awesome and I hope that they do.\n\n175\n00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:12.178\nBut if you are encountering these problems\nat least hopefully it's a little like,\n\n176\n00:10:12.178 --> 00:10:15.392\nokay, well, at least you're\nhaving those same problems too.\n\n177\n00:10:15.392 --> 00:10:16.710\n[LAUGH] Because that's how I was feeling.\n\n178\n00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.344\nAm I the only one here?\n\n179\n00:10:18.344 --> 00:10:21.417\nAnd sometimes it is that, it's just me.\n\n180\n00:10:21.417 --> 00:10:24.382\nIt's what we call a PEBKAC error.\n\n181\n00:10:24.382 --> 00:10:29.133\nYou know what a PEBKAC (LAUGHS) I\ncan't even say it anymore, Justin.\n\n182\n00:10:29.133 --> 00:10:33.645\n&gt;&gt; Is it a person in between the pc and\nchair or something like that?\n\n183\n00:10:33.645 --> 00:10:37.521\n&gt;&gt; Problem exists between computer and\nkeyboard or chair and keyboard,\n\n184\n00:10:37.521 --> 00:10:41.080\nI just said computer and\nkeyboard is the same thing, okay.\n\n185\n00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.609\nChair and computer, computer and keyboard.\n\n186\n00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:46.981\nIt's you, okay?\n\n187\n00:10:46.981 --> 00:10:49.175\n[LAUGH] It's you as the user\nthat's the problem.\n\n188\n00:10:49.175 --> 00:10:50.480\nSo, all right.\n\n189\n00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.634\nSo I've gone through all of these\ndifferent scenarios about opening\n\n190\n00:10:53.634 --> 00:10:55.450\nthe files, not having access.\n\n191\n00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:58.521\nLet's talk about removing access, okay?\n\n192\n00:10:58.521 --> 00:11:02.392\nLet's come back on down,\nI'm still in Joey on a PC world so\n\n193\n00:11:02.392 --> 00:11:05.170\nI'm just gonna close out of the browser.\n\n194\n00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:07.490\nAnd let's switch back over to this side.\n\n195\n00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:12.209\nSo this is Mac, this is JT as the owner.\n\n196\n00:11:12.209 --> 00:11:14.879\nI am going to close out of Excel locally.\n\n197\n00:11:14.879 --> 00:11:17.975\nI still have my One Drive\npulled up in my browser and\n\n198\n00:11:17.975 --> 00:11:22.766\nwe kind of alluded to this back in the\nother episode is that if I come over here,\n\n199\n00:11:22.766 --> 00:11:25.076\nno, I don't wanna open it, sorry.\n\n200\n00:11:25.076 --> 00:11:30.097\n[LAUGH] If I come over here to,\nthis is Justin Timberlake, okay, perfect.\n\n201\n00:11:30.097 --> 00:11:35.518\nNow let's go on over to this,\nlet's go over to our sharing.\n\n202\n00:11:35.518 --> 00:11:36.732\nYou know what, we're gonna do this.\n\n203\n00:11:36.732 --> 00:11:38.143\nWe're just gonna close out of this and\n\n204\n00:11:38.143 --> 00:11:41.090\nopen up OneDrive because it's not giving\nme the options that I wanted to see.\n\n205\n00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:43.368\nThis is what I was trying to get to,\nall right.\n\n206\n00:11:43.368 --> 00:11:45.365\nWhen in doubt, start again.\n\n207\n00:11:45.365 --> 00:11:49.433\nNow I get to the option\nwhere I have my file.\n\n208\n00:11:49.433 --> 00:11:52.823\nAnd I go over to the shared\nover on the right hand side and\n\n209\n00:11:52.823 --> 00:11:56.825\nit brings up in this right panel\nall of the options that I can do.\n\n210\n00:11:56.825 --> 00:12:01.416\nSo a little lower down here behind my head\nyou can see that I have people that have\n\n211\n00:12:01.416 --> 00:12:02.261\naccess to it.\n\n212\n00:12:02.261 --> 00:12:06.780\nAnd maybe I'm done sharing with everybody,\nokay, because everyone's calling me and\n\n213\n00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.085\nthey're getting all sorts of upset.\n\n214\n00:12:09.085 --> 00:12:14.681\nWe're gonna go to Manage Access and then\nwhat I can do is I can take people off.\n\n215\n00:12:14.681 --> 00:12:19.837\nNow why is Justin and\nVonne not showing up on this?\n\n216\n00:12:19.837 --> 00:12:21.562\nThey're outside of the organization.\n\n217\n00:12:21.562 --> 00:12:25.483\nOkay, so if you don't see every single\nperson individually, cuz right now you can\n\n218\n00:12:25.483 --> 00:12:28.747\nsee it's just Justin Timberlake and\nJoey Fatone back here, right?\n\n219\n00:12:28.747 --> 00:12:32.758\nBut there's other people\nthat can use this link.\n\n220\n00:12:32.758 --> 00:12:34.472\nSo I could just say, okay,\n\n221\n00:12:34.472 --> 00:12:38.433\nI can remove the link that they\nget even get access to it, okay.\n\n222\n00:12:38.433 --> 00:12:42.107\nI could also take off Joey.\n\n223\n00:12:42.107 --> 00:12:45.158\nJoey doesn't need have any\nediting capabilities, so\n\n224\n00:12:45.158 --> 00:12:46.828\nI can stop sharing with Joey.\n\n225\n00:12:46.828 --> 00:12:48.893\nBecause maybe I had multiple\npeople in my organization.\n\n226\n00:12:48.893 --> 00:12:53.976\nMaybe I had Lance and Joey in there, so\nI want Lance to stay on, but not Joey.\n\n227\n00:12:53.976 --> 00:12:56.503\nSo you can individually.\n\n228\n00:12:56.503 --> 00:12:59.800\nLot of times it's gonna work a lot better\nwith people within your organization.\n\n229\n00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:04.330\nOutside doesn't always\nshow up individual people.\n\n230\n00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:09.215\nBut if I wanna stop sharing altogether,\nyou can just click stop sharing.\n\n231\n00:13:09.215 --> 00:13:15.091\nAnd as soon as I stop sharing, then I can\ngo ahead and just nobody gets anymore.\n\n232\n00:13:15.091 --> 00:13:16.696\nEverybody goes away.\n\n233\n00:13:16.696 --> 00:13:17.760\nDid I click this already?\n\n234\n00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:18.968\nStop sharing, okay.\n\n235\n00:13:18.968 --> 00:13:23.004\nAnd then if I close that I should\nbe able to now not have anybody,\n\n236\n00:13:23.004 --> 00:13:28.203\nmaybe I should refresh my browser just\nin case cuz it's still there, isn't it?\n\n237\n00:13:28.203 --> 00:13:31.464\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was getting ready to ask\nyou does that eventually go away?\n\n238\n00:13:31.464 --> 00:13:35.198\nCuz that would be super kinda confusing.\n\n239\n00:13:35.198 --> 00:13:38.705\n&gt;&gt; And look once I refresh my browser,\nsee this sort, filter, share?\n\n240\n00:13:38.705 --> 00:13:40.757\nIt now says private, okay.\n\n241\n00:13:40.757 --> 00:13:46.444\nWhich, if you wanted to not even through\nExcel, you can come over here and\n\n242\n00:13:46.444 --> 00:13:50.228\nif you look over,\nI can manage the access again.\n\n243\n00:13:50.228 --> 00:13:54.483\nAnd then add people into granting access.\n\n244\n00:13:54.483 --> 00:13:58.976\nThe way we did it before in the original\nepisode, we did it through Excel,\n\n245\n00:13:58.976 --> 00:13:59.781\ndidn't we?\n\n246\n00:13:59.781 --> 00:14:03.884\nBut again I said it's really just\na shortcut for how you can manage and\n\n247\n00:14:03.884 --> 00:14:05.870\nshare files through One Drive.\n\n248\n00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:12.300\nThis is really more of a One Drive\nfeature than an Excel feature.\n\n249\n00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:17.840\nIt's just that they are trying to tie\neverything together in using this portal,\n\n250\n00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.143\nif you want to say,\n\n251\n00:14:19.143 --> 00:14:23.140\nto be able to collaborate with\nother people that you have.\n\n252\n00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:28.360\nSo as an owner that's how\nyou can you remove access.\n\n253\n00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:33.354\nLet's switch over to Vonne,\n\n254\n00:14:33.354 --> 00:14:36.359\nright over here.\n\n255\n00:14:36.359 --> 00:14:39.868\nThis is still open by the way, I bet you\nif I refresh this it probably gonna go\n\n256\n00:14:39.868 --> 00:14:42.300\nahead and tell me I don't have access,\nyeah okay.\n\n257\n00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.264\nTotally different access denied, but\n\n258\n00:14:44.264 --> 00:14:47.489\nat least I know now I don't have\nthe permissions to access this.\n\n259\n00:14:47.489 --> 00:14:51.624\nSo if I close this tab, and\nthat was the other option, okay, for\n\n260\n00:14:51.624 --> 00:14:54.850\nwhen we tried to open up that other file.\n\n261\n00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:59.155\nSo now here, it's still showing up,\nlook at all of these other ones down here.\n\n262\n00:14:59.155 --> 00:15:01.771\nLike this one, I remember I was\ndoing some practice on this one.\n\n263\n00:15:01.771 --> 00:15:02.751\nI don't wanna see this.\n\n264\n00:15:02.751 --> 00:15:06.417\nIt's still showing up in\nmy list as a recipient\n\n265\n00:15:06.417 --> 00:15:09.335\nof shared documents in this Shared.\n\n266\n00:15:09.335 --> 00:15:10.814\nJust go away.\n\n267\n00:15:10.814 --> 00:15:14.062\n[LAUGH] That little drop down or\nthe little dots next to it,\n\n268\n00:15:14.062 --> 00:15:16.590\nI can just remove this from my list.\n\n269\n00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:18.843\nSo stop seeing it, okay.\n\n270\n00:15:18.843 --> 00:15:21.461\nYou'll still have access to it,\nbut it won't appear here.\n\n271\n00:15:21.461 --> 00:15:24.848\nWell, I already know that I\ndon't have access to this file.\n\n272\n00:15:24.848 --> 00:15:26.758\nSo do you see how it's twofold?\n\n273\n00:15:26.758 --> 00:15:31.524\nYou could take it off of your list\nbecause I don't want to see it\n\n274\n00:15:31.524 --> 00:15:35.109\neven though I as the owner\nshared it out to you.\n\n275\n00:15:35.109 --> 00:15:35.971\nDoes that make sense to you?\n\n276\n00:15:35.971 --> 00:15:40.991\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so as the owner I get to\ndictate what things you can do, right.\n\n277\n00:15:40.991 --> 00:15:45.414\nYou can do whatever you want to or\nmaybe it's just a view only.\n\n278\n00:15:45.414 --> 00:15:48.208\nBut as the recipient,\nthe best I can do is, more or less,\n\n279\n00:15:48.208 --> 00:15:50.240\nhide it from myself, right?\n\n280\n00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:54.751\n&gt;&gt; Yes, because I could say hey,\nwell you still have access to it.\n\n281\n00:15:54.751 --> 00:15:57.334\nWell I deleted it off my list.\n\n282\n00:15:57.334 --> 00:15:58.371\nWell why'd you do that?\n\n283\n00:15:58.371 --> 00:16:01.998\nAnd then, well I still want you to work\nwith it, and then you have to go back to\n\n284\n00:16:01.998 --> 00:16:04.960\nyour email and find the link again and\nall those things we did.\n\n285\n00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:09.760\nSo yes,\nit's really just hiding it from my list.\n\n286\n00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:13.200\nBut if I know as recipient that JT,\nwhat we did,\n\n287\n00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:17.940\nstopped sharing the document with me,\nI just don't wanna do it.\n\n288\n00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:20.595\nIt's more of a housekeeping thing,\nas well.\n\n289\n00:16:20.595 --> 00:16:23.047\nEither they're hiding it or\nyou are housekeeping to say,\n\n290\n00:16:23.047 --> 00:16:26.150\ngetting rid of documents that you\nknow have been unshared with you.\n\n291\n00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:30.905\n&gt;&gt; So if JT unshared it with me,\nit doesn't automatically\n\n292\n00:16:30.905 --> 00:16:34.758\nget rid of itself from\nmy shared with me list?\n\n293\n00:16:34.758 --> 00:16:36.679\nI have to physically remove them?\n\n294\n00:16:36.679 --> 00:16:40.910\n&gt;&gt; From everything that I can see at\nthis point in time, no it does not.\n\n295\n00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:46.543\nBecause I know, some of those other files,\nI know that I hadn't worked with them,\n\n296\n00:16:46.543 --> 00:16:51.869\nor I had stopped sharing or deleted it\nfrom JT's account as the owner days ago.\n\n297\n00:16:51.869 --> 00:16:54.047\nBut it's still just showing up.\n\n298\n00:16:54.047 --> 00:17:00.965\nMaybe it's a latency thing, maybe it\neventually will go ahead and populate.\n\n299\n00:17:00.965 --> 00:17:05.597\nI hate doing, I don't really know, but\nfrom everything that I have witnessed\n\n300\n00:17:05.597 --> 00:17:10.520\nmyself, because I have all these different\naccounts, I'm going back and forth.\n\n301\n00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:14.884\nIt doesn't seem to just take\nit off automatically, so far.\n\n302\n00:17:14.884 --> 00:17:17.114\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne,\nthat's definitely good to know.\n\n303\n00:17:17.114 --> 00:17:22.162\nAre there any other kind of hiccups\nthat we may encounter with sharing and\n\n304\n00:17:22.162 --> 00:17:24.903\nco-authoring and all this Excel fun?\n\n305\n00:17:24.903 --> 00:17:26.248\n&gt;&gt; That's a loaded question.\n\n306\n00:17:26.248 --> 00:17:31.496\n[LAUGH] At this time, I feel I have\ncovered everything that I have run into\n\n307\n00:17:31.496 --> 00:17:36.657\ncuz I always try to come from your\nperspective of well what about this,\n\n308\n00:17:36.657 --> 00:17:39.350\nwhat about this, what about that?\n\n309\n00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:43.410\nLike you said the best way to learn\nsomething is to test its limit is to\n\n310\n00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:44.062\nbreak it.\n\n311\n00:17:44.062 --> 00:17:45.297\nHow can I break this?\n\n312\n00:17:45.297 --> 00:17:48.473\nWe've broken this thing so\nmany which ways, but\n\n313\n00:17:48.473 --> 00:17:53.588\nit did show me something because we have\nthat ability to test, test and test and\n\n314\n00:17:53.588 --> 00:17:59.510\ntest, because we're getting ready and\npreparing this information for you guys.\n\n315\n00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:03.485\nYou guys in an office environment,\nyou don't necessarily have days,\n\n316\n00:18:03.485 --> 00:18:05.813\nI'm talking days I've been doing this.\n\n317\n00:18:05.813 --> 00:18:08.899\n[LAUGH] You don't have days to\nalways figure out that problem.\n\n318\n00:18:08.899 --> 00:18:11.739\nWell, maybe you spend it but then you've\njust taken all of your productivity and\n\n319\n00:18:11.739 --> 00:18:13.730\njust thrown it out the window.\n\n320\n00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:15.686\nWhy did you get that TPS report?\n\n321\n00:18:15.686 --> 00:18:18.897\nI was fixing the share\ncollaborations in Excel.\n\n322\n00:18:18.897 --> 00:18:22.869\nSo hopefully this is just letting\nyou know what's going on.\n\n323\n00:18:22.869 --> 00:18:25.821\nYes, we've filmed two\nepisodes on troubleshooting.\n\n324\n00:18:25.821 --> 00:18:30.623\nIt's taken maybe 45 minutes for you to\nwatch both of these, but hopefully you can\n\n325\n00:18:30.623 --> 00:18:34.410\nat least be armed with the knowledge\nthat this is going to happen.\n\n326\n00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:38.637\nIt doesn't blindside you and\nyou can adjust accordingly.\n\n327\n00:18:38.637 --> 00:18:40.302\nThat's what I hope to accomplish.\n\n328\n00:18:40.302 --> 00:18:43.138\nSo is there more, maybe.\n\n329\n00:18:43.138 --> 00:18:45.867\n[LAUGH] But I hadn't found it.\n\n330\n00:18:45.867 --> 00:18:49.565\nBut if you did find anything, contact me,\nand I will see what I can do for you.\n\n331\n00:18:49.565 --> 00:18:52.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI'm gonna need you to come in on Saturday.\n\n332\n00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:53.575\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, no, well,\n\n333\n00:18:53.575 --> 00:18:56.349\nhopefully that's gonna be helpful to you,\nand\n\n334\n00:18:56.349 --> 00:19:00.440\nmake things a little easier because\nyour goal is to get stuff done.\n\n335\n00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.294\nNot to poke and prod and\ngo why is this not working?\n\n336\n00:19:03.294 --> 00:19:04.961\nSo definitely take all of this in.\n\n337\n00:19:04.961 --> 00:19:08.254\nAnd remember things may change but\nwe're gonna go ahead and get out of here.\n\n338\n00:19:08.254 --> 00:19:11.081\nSo signing off for OfficeProTV I've\nbeen your host Justin Dennison.\n\n339\n00:19:11.081 --> 00:19:11.960\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonn Smith.\n\n340\n00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.407\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n341\n00:19:14.407 --> 00:19:18.528\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.816\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n4\n00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:18.519\nAnd well, you're not seeing things,\n\n5\n00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:21.365\nwe're actually back with more\nExcel 2016 Advanced for Mac.\n\n6\n00:00:21.365 --> 00:00:25.840\nAnd we're gonna be talking about Version\nHistory, almost said Version Control.\n\n7\n00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.650\nI'm sure we're gonna do that several times\nin this episode, so, don't get confused,\n\n8\n00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.870\nwe're gonna be talking\nabout version history.\n\n9\n00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.420\nAnd here to keep us all straight is\nthe one and only Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n10\n00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.771\nHow are you doing today, Vonne?\n&gt;&gt; I'm not sure I'll be able to do that\n\n11\n00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:41.756\n[LAUGH] but I will try, for sure.\n&gt;&gt; Well, you know me Vonne,\n\n12\n00:00:41.756 --> 00:00:44.274\nI am an over-promise,\nunder-deliver kinda person.\n\n13\n00:00:44.274 --> 00:00:48.732\nBut Version History, this kinda hits\nme near and dear to the heart, but\n\n14\n00:00:48.732 --> 00:00:51.778\nwe've alluded to it in\nprevious episodes that it\n\n15\n00:00:51.778 --> 00:00:55.220\ndoesn't quite work like\nversion control in my world.\n\n16\n00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.310\nIt's a little bit different, so,\ncan you just give us a brief overview of\n\n17\n00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.569\nwhat is Version History?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz I would call it our third\n\n18\n00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:08.531\npart, maybe our three and a half part\nin our miniseries about coauthoring,\n\n19\n00:01:08.531 --> 00:01:11.105\nand we've talked about the autosave.\n\n20\n00:01:11.105 --> 00:01:13.535\nWe've talked all about\nthe troubleshooting, and\n\n21\n00:01:13.535 --> 00:01:17.322\nthe different things that those little\ncaveats, those kind of gotchas here and\n\n22\n00:01:17.322 --> 00:01:20.841\nthere, and I wanted to dedicate a whole\nepisode just to Version History.\n\n23\n00:01:20.841 --> 00:01:26.040\nI have to really control myself as\nwell to not say Version Control.\n\n24\n00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.226\nBut what it does is it is allowing,\nor actually taking I would say\n\n25\n00:01:31.226 --> 00:01:38.680\nsnapshots at certain intervals of how much\nprogress you have made in a document.\n\n26\n00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.450\nAnd this is all connected to the autosave.\n\n27\n00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.330\nWhen you go ahead and\nsave something up into the cloud, meaning,\n\n28\n00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.040\nfor us in this example,\nOneDrive for Business.\n\n29\n00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.690\nSo when you've saved it up\ninto a OneDrive account,\n\n30\n00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.600\nthen the autosave\nautomatically is enabled.\n\n31\n00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.670\nSo you can go ahead and just work, and\n\n32\n00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.680\nit will automatically save\nyour changes to that.\n\n33\n00:02:04.122 --> 00:02:07.890\nNow, autosave only happens if\nyou saved it up to the cloud.\n\n34\n00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.360\nThis is not enabled on a locally\nstored file, said that a couple times,\n\n35\n00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.080\nbut I'm just trying to reiterate it right\nnow, just in case you're like, what?\n\n36\n00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.418\nMine's out.\n\n37\n00:02:17.418 --> 00:02:23.660\nYeah, and while this is part of\nthe coauthoring collaboration miniseries,\n\n38\n00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.610\nyou don't have to be necessarily be\ncollaborating with somebody else.\n\n39\n00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:34.133\nYou don't have to have the document\nshared out to enable Version History.\n\n40\n00:02:34.133 --> 00:02:36.990\nOkay, you could just be\ndoing it with yourself.\n\n41\n00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.100\nAnd you've been working with a file for\ndays on end, and\n\n42\n00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.940\nyou realize you did all this\nwork on a file on, say,\n\n43\n00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.210\nFriday, and\nyou're like that's all sorts of wrong.\n\n44\n00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.560\nI've done a big mistake,\nI need to revert back.\n\n45\n00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.826\nWell, it's gonna give you certain\nsnapshots of where you can roll back and\n\n46\n00:02:59.826 --> 00:03:04.316\nthen restore to a certain point of,\nsay, Thursday.\n\n47\n00:03:04.316 --> 00:03:09.575\nOkay, and if you're on a Mac,\nnot trying to assume anything,\n\n48\n00:03:09.575 --> 00:03:13.645\nbut, there's something\ncalled Time Machine,\n\n49\n00:03:13.645 --> 00:03:20.017\nwhere you can basically take snapshots\nof your computer at certain states.\n\n50\n00:03:20.017 --> 00:03:23.757\nAnd then if you have a blow out,\nif you wanna say, and\n\n51\n00:03:23.757 --> 00:03:29.287\nsomething goes horribly awry,\nyou can reinstall your computer basically,\n\n52\n00:03:29.287 --> 00:03:33.760\nyour operating system,\nto that particular save point.\n\n53\n00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.930\nAnd I'll tell you, it has saved me more\nthan a couple of times throughout my life.\n\n54\n00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.380\nSo thank you McIntosh and Time Machine,\nand all that wonderful stuff.\n\n55\n00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.925\nSo, that's In a nutshell what\nVersion History is in Office.\n\n56\n00:03:49.925 --> 00:03:53.381\nBut it equates to a lot of different\nthings that deal on snapshots, or\n\n57\n00:03:53.381 --> 00:03:56.359\nbeing able to save at certain points and\nthen rolling back,\n\n58\n00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:00.330\njust like your Version Control in some\nof the products that you work with.\n\n59\n00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.990\n&gt;&gt; And Version Control, like I said,\n\n60\n00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.780\nit's something that I use a great deal,\nbut the snapshots, and\n\n61\n00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.880\nnot to give away the fun,\nare sometimes a little iffy.\n\n62\n00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:18.060\nSo once we have it ready, right, do we\njust have Version Control up and going?\n\n63\n00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.590\nDo we have to turn on anything,\n\n64\n00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.500\nother than just put it up in the cloud?\n&gt;&gt; Just the autosave,\n\n65\n00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.470\nyeah, as long as it's there,\nit will go ahead and do that.\n\n66\n00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.780\nAnd that's where I feel\nlike Version Control,\n\n67\n00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.730\nyou have control over what is\ngoing to create those snapshots.\n\n68\n00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.730\nFrom my experience,\nat this time of the recording,\n\n69\n00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:41.340\nI cannot [LAUGH] find the rhyme or\nreason to when it takes it.\n\n70\n00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.340\nI have looked tirelessly for\nmore documentation.\n\n71\n00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.611\nWe've done experiments where we've sat\nthere, and I put a timer, I don't have my\n\n72\n00:04:49.611 --> 00:04:53.344\nwatch on right now, I put a timer\nevery minute, I'd type something in.\n\n73\n00:04:53.344 --> 00:04:57.857\nI did that for 20 minutes, and\nit didn't, so it's like, I'll show you,\n\n74\n00:04:57.857 --> 00:05:01.478\nwe'll try to give you a little\nbit more information about it.\n\n75\n00:05:01.478 --> 00:05:04.889\nBut I'm here to say that the rhyme or\n\n76\n00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:10.236\nreason of when you get openable\nversions of your files,\n\n77\n00:05:10.236 --> 00:05:13.550\nit's kind of a little haphazard.\n\n78\n00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.892\nWould we say that there, Justin?\n&gt;&gt; Well Vonne,\n\n79\n00:05:16.892 --> 00:05:20.688\nI've been behind the scenes working with\nyou on this, so I kind of know the story.\n\n80\n00:05:20.688 --> 00:05:23.691\nWell, you probably don't know the story,\nso\n\n81\n00:05:23.691 --> 00:05:28.550\nI guess take us through maybe a document\nand show us what this is all about.\n\n82\n00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:29.330\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n83\n00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.650\nso why don't we come down to the computer,\nI've already got Excel opened up.\n\n84\n00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.970\nAnd the file that we have been working on,\nI'll go to the recent.\n\n85\n00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.800\nAnd this is, remember in\nthe troubleshooting where it's like,\n\n86\n00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.990\nif you go to the Share,\nit won't well, there it is.\n\n87\n00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.850\nBut, to prove my point that this\ndidn't always happen, this is the one,\n\n88\n00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.620\nthe sort and\nfilter share that we were using in\n\n89\n00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.510\nthe previous episodes within\nthis little miniseries.\n\n90\n00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.120\nThis was something I was doing today,\ncuz I started working on the PC side.\n\n91\n00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.120\nRemember, we had a little bit of\nthat in the troubleshooting episode.\n\n92\n00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.890\nWell, I'm going through on the PC side\nfrom that whole other ball of wax.\n\n93\n00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.480\nBut if I go to Recent,\nthere is a file that you and\n\n94\n00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.152\nI have been working on called\nVersion History Share.\n\n95\n00:06:13.152 --> 00:06:17.630\nNow notice, I don't know if you can\nsee it, but it is in my SharePoint.\n\n96\n00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.370\nI've put it up to the cloud.\n\n97\n00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.960\nYou guys haven't seen this\nfile been opened yet, but\n\n98\n00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.180\nit's not showing up here in shared.\n\n99\n00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.985\nYou have access to it,\nJoey has access to it,\n\n100\n00:06:26.985 --> 00:06:30.680\nVonne has access to it, JT is the owner.\n\n101\n00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.010\nSo it's still not showing up in the Share,\nokay?\n\n102\n00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.514\nSo don't rely on this,\n\n103\n00:06:34.514 --> 00:06:38.367\nas the only place that you can\nopen your document as an owner.\n\n104\n00:06:38.367 --> 00:06:41.410\nRemember, we're coming from\nthe owner's standpoint.\n\n105\n00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.695\nSo I'm gonna go to Recent,\nopen this file up.\n\n106\n00:06:44.695 --> 00:06:47.432\nNow you and I have been working on this.\n\n107\n00:06:47.432 --> 00:06:52.250\nI've been moving it over onto my\nother account, meaning I've logged\n\n108\n00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:56.740\ninto my other account here in my computer,\nworked on it as Vonne,\n\n109\n00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.923\nworked on it as Justin,\nJoey on a PC, the whole nine, okay?\n\n110\n00:07:00.923 --> 00:07:05.987\nNow, this looks a little different,\nbecause I put it back to a particular\n\n111\n00:07:05.987 --> 00:07:11.070\nrestore point, but I wanted to get\na couple days worth of history, okay?\n\n112\n00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:15.188\nYou've seen me go to this a couple times,\nbut up here in the little upper right hand\n\n113\n00:07:15.188 --> 00:07:19.383\ncorner, there's a little clock, and this\nis where you get your Version History.\n\n114\n00:07:19.383 --> 00:07:22.970\nAnd it's in this task pane, and\nyou can see if I scroll on down,\n\n115\n00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:26.020\nlet's go ahead behind my head so\nyou can see.\n\n116\n00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:31.720\nAll the way down at the bottom is when\nJustin Timberlake saved the file.\n\n117\n00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:37.150\nAnd then if you look at the time stamps,\nthis was all done on April 16th.\n\n118\n00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.218\nAnd you can see that Vonne saved the file,\n\n119\n00:07:40.218 --> 00:07:44.699\nJustin at ITProTV saved the file,\nthen Joey did some stuff.\n\n120\n00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:48.555\nSo it's basically a log of what everybody,\nwell,\n\n121\n00:07:48.555 --> 00:07:53.140\ncertain users that have accessed the file,\nand have saved.\n\n122\n00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:58.929\nNow notice, for example, in this little\nsection right here That Joey went ahead,\n\n123\n00:07:58.929 --> 00:08:02.403\nand was working from 9:45 to 10:09, and\n\n124\n00:08:02.403 --> 00:08:07.220\nthere's three different options for\nopening different versions.\n\n125\n00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:12.501\nBut if you look at the time,\nokay, 9:45 to 9:51.\n\n126\n00:08:12.501 --> 00:08:13.977\nOkay, help me with math, Justin.\n\n127\n00:08:13.977 --> 00:08:16.508\nThat's [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; That's six minutes.\n\n128\n00:08:16.508 --> 00:08:17.910\n&gt;&gt; Six minutes, yes, okay.\n\n129\n00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:19.580\nSo I've got six minutes between that.\n\n130\n00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:23.267\nSo between 9:51 and 10:09.\n\n131\n00:08:23.267 --> 00:08:26.032\nThat's-\n&gt;&gt; 18 minutes.\n\n132\n00:08:26.032 --> 00:08:28.741\n&gt;&gt; 18 minutes, [LAUGH] thank you.\n\n133\n00:08:28.741 --> 00:08:30.680\n[LAUGH] I'm so\nglad you're good at math and things.\n\n134\n00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.460\nSo that's 18 minutes.\n\n135\n00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:35.184\nSo it's 6 and 18.\n\n136\n00:08:35.184 --> 00:08:37.240\nI mean, how does that?\n\n137\n00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:42.210\nI mean, it's not like every 10\nminutes we got the same snapshot, or\n\n138\n00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:48.460\nafter a certain amount of input, how much\ntime I actually spent in the document.\n\n139\n00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:53.284\nAnd that's where I would do, I typed\nin one line, did something else for\n\n140\n00:08:53.284 --> 00:08:57.553\n10 minutes, then came back,\ncame back 20 minutes later and\n\n141\n00:08:57.553 --> 00:09:00.421\nit's just like I can't find the pattern.\n\n142\n00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:05.688\nI'll be completely honest with you guys,\nI can't find the pattern.\n\n143\n00:09:05.688 --> 00:09:08.996\nYou remember, we sat there and\nlooked, I mean,\n\n144\n00:09:08.996 --> 00:09:13.045\nwe googled like crazy on the,\nokay, how long does it take?\n\n145\n00:09:13.045 --> 00:09:13.995\nWhat's your intervals?\n\n146\n00:09:13.995 --> 00:09:16.425\nWe couldn't find any\ndocumentation on that, could we?\n\n147\n00:09:16.425 --> 00:09:17.425\n&gt;&gt; We couldn't really find any\n\n148\n00:09:17.425 --> 00:09:18.155\ndocumentation.\n\n149\n00:09:18.155 --> 00:09:20.815\nAnd what's interesting,\nright after that, that 10:34 to 10:41.\n\n150\n00:09:20.815 --> 00:09:24.935\nIf I'm remembering correctly,\nI tried to make a change about every three\n\n151\n00:09:24.935 --> 00:09:25.945\nminutes.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n152\n00:09:25.945 --> 00:09:28.195\n&gt;&gt; So I would do an atomic change, so\n\n153\n00:09:28.195 --> 00:09:32.550\nI actually, I did the time and the date.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n154\n00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:33.130\n&gt;&gt; And I went Enter,\n\n155\n00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:34.450\nand then I wouldn't touch it.\n\n156\n00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:35.860\nAnd then I'd go it's been three minutes.\n\n157\n00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.430\nTime and the date, boom.\n\n158\n00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:38.950\nEnter, time and the date.\n\n159\n00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:39.600\nBoom, Enter.\n\n160\n00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.750\nBut I only got two version histories,\nbut I think I had about five entries.\n\n161\n00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:49.230\nSo one or two of them were in one and\nthe other three are in the other.\n\n162\n00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:53.510\nIt was really odd.\n&gt;&gt; And this is a great point to say well,\n\n163\n00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.060\nwhy don't we go see what\nyou had done at that point?\n\n164\n00:09:56.060 --> 00:10:02.050\nRight there where it says open version, if\nI click on this, I can open the version.\n\n165\n00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:06.700\nAnd the point in time that\nJustin was at right here, okay?\n\n166\n00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.900\nAnd that's where, yeah,\nwe started timestamping.\n\n167\n00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.590\nWe started giving the dates and\nthe timestamps for\n\n168\n00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:15.370\neverything that we were doing, okay?\n\n169\n00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:18.850\nEdited by Justin, we were adding\nour different worksheets in here.\n\n170\n00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:22.220\nSo the cool thing is,\nthis is a really good example,\n\n171\n00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.910\nas well as why version history?\n\n172\n00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:30.772\nEven as kind of haphazard and slightly\nwonky as it is, look at how cool that is.\n\n173\n00:10:30.772 --> 00:10:34.840\nI can go back to where this is\nthe file as it is right now.\n\n174\n00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:39.090\nBut look at what this file\nlooks like versus this file.\n\n175\n00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:41.370\nIt's like wow, we did so many.\n\n176\n00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:44.390\nAnd this is like whoa, bad,\nwe did bad things here.\n\n177\n00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:45.510\nWe weren't supposed to.\n\n178\n00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.760\nBut we have a version of it that,\n\n179\n00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:52.340\nat least if I can get back to this point,\nmaybe I lost a few things.\n\n180\n00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:54.200\nAt least if this is\na great starting point,\n\n181\n00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:58.880\nthen I'm like, whew, okay, I can get\nback to here and then work forward.\n\n182\n00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.640\nAnd it is pretty cool that, and\nI just closed that version,\n\n183\n00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.390\nthat it does give us quite a few more.\n\n184\n00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:06.197\nSo if I open up the next one,\nthe one at 10:41.\n\n185\n00:11:06.197 --> 00:11:08.864\nLet's see what this one looks like.\n\n186\n00:11:08.864 --> 00:11:12.469\nAnd right there you can see\nthat if I zoom in right there,\n\n187\n00:11:12.469 --> 00:11:15.318\nyou said that you went ahead at 10:41.\n\n188\n00:11:15.318 --> 00:11:18.720\nYou closed and reopened and\nedit by Justin.\n\n189\n00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.740\nSo we were trying to really\ndocument what we were doing\n\n190\n00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:26.770\nin the file to try to make some of that\nrhyme or reason on the version control.\n\n191\n00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:32.240\nBut again, it gives you some good points,\nso I like version history.\n\n192\n00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.663\nI think it's a great thing.\n\n193\n00:11:36.163 --> 00:11:39.861\nJust don't get too reliant on\nit's gonna give me everything,\n\n194\n00:11:39.861 --> 00:11:43.910\nit's gonna be very granular,\nit's gonna give me all the details.\n\n195\n00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:49.390\nIt's just gonna kinda give you haphazard\nstops along the way as a progress file.\n\n196\n00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:50.700\n&gt;&gt; And with that said,\n\n197\n00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.970\nbecause you can open these side by side,\nmaybe you just need to pick and choose, so\n\n198\n00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:55.510\nthere is a little more leg work.\n\n199\n00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:57.090\nThis is just not what I'm used to.\n\n200\n00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:00.930\nI'm used to more granular kind\nof microscopic attention,\n\n201\n00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:02.590\ninstead of these large scale snapshots.\n\n202\n00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:08.280\nAnd kind of what I think about of is\nimagine that you're taking pictures\n\n203\n00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:12.860\nof a very slow-moving snail, right?\n\n204\n00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:17.270\nYou might have a lot of pictures of\na snail roughly in the same place.\n\n205\n00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:20.900\nIf you do the exact same thing\nat the race track, right,\n\n206\n00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.460\neven though you're taking\nthe pictures at the same rate,\n\n207\n00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:28.910\nyou may have different distances that are\ncovered between the respective snapshots.\n\n208\n00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:30.760\nSo if you think of them as snapshots,\n\n209\n00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.410\njust remember the faster you move,\nthe more possible changes\n\n210\n00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:37.150\nthere are between snapshots.\n&gt;&gt; That's a really good way of\n\n211\n00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:37.990\nexplaining it.\n\n212\n00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:41.202\nI like that, okay, what he said.\n\n213\n00:12:41.202 --> 00:12:45.509\n[LAUGH] Great, and back to where\nyou said hey, if I can get here,\n\n214\n00:12:45.509 --> 00:12:50.410\nlet's jump down back here,\nI could take this, I could copy it.\n\n215\n00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:53.290\nAnd I could bring this in, and\nthen I could paste it in here.\n\n216\n00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:59.460\nSo I could bring in little chunks or\npieces of past episodes or\n\n217\n00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:03.490\npast versions of this particular file and\nkind of pick and choose.\n\n218\n00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:08.990\nOkay, so again, good stuff going on here,\nokay, totally good.\n\n219\n00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:12.490\nAnd I'm just using my command tilde\nto switch back and forth, and\n\n220\n00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:15.030\nthen I can go ahead and close this out.\n\n221\n00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:16.280\nAnd then I'm back into here.\n\n222\n00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.370\nNow, let's look a little bit further up.\n\n223\n00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:22.840\nSo you can see there's a couple days\nworth of history going on in here.\n\n224\n00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:26.136\nAnd different users, so I can see\nthat okay there is one with Vonne,\n\n225\n00:13:26.136 --> 00:13:29.980\nthere's one with Justin, there is one\nwith JT, there's one with Joey Photon.\n\n226\n00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.980\nSo it also is user based.\n\n227\n00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:38.530\nIt's going to show me each user doing\ndifferent things even if it was just like\n\n228\n00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:43.840\nokay, open and change one thing because\nthat's a good thing that's by users.\n\n229\n00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:48.740\nThe other thing that is cool is\nlook at what I have over here.\n\n230\n00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:49.590\nI restored.\n\n231\n00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:51.100\nIt's giving me options or\n\n232\n00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:55.460\nshowing me the history of I restored\nit to a previous version, okay,\n\n233\n00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:59.550\nbecause maybe that's where it's like,\nman, we really kinda messed that one up.\n\n234\n00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:03.290\nSo I went all the way back and that's\nwhere I put myself back to this point.\n\n235\n00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:10.067\nBut if I went to, let's go right before,\nlet's go to this one.\n\n236\n00:14:10.067 --> 00:14:11.522\nLook at how many work sheets we have.\n\n237\n00:14:11.522 --> 00:14:16.084\nWe have JT, we have Justin,\nwe have Vonne, and we have Joey.\n\n238\n00:14:16.084 --> 00:14:19.560\nOkay, look it, [LAUGH] got distracted,\nclosing browser now.\n\n239\n00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:24.060\nI was trying to remind myself of what\nI did throughout of all of this,\n\n240\n00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.320\nadding content every minute, okay?\n\n241\n00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:28.990\nI like this file.\n\n242\n00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:33.050\nI realize that all this work\nthat we did maybe the next day,\n\n243\n00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:34.530\nthat's not good any more.\n\n244\n00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:38.100\nSo I can take this and I can restore this.\n\n245\n00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:43.220\nThis needs to be the version that we\nare working on and going forward, okay?\n\n246\n00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:46.330\nSo I restore it, okay, let's go head and\n\n247\n00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:50.543\nclick on this, and\nthen you see I close all of them out.\n\n248\n00:14:50.543 --> 00:14:58.100\nHere we go, this was the last save,\nApril 20th to 19 PM.\n\n249\n00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.550\nIf I look at my version history and\n\n250\n00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:05.170\nyou can see, yeah, I've just\nrestored it to a particular point.\n\n251\n00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:08.730\nBut if I wanted to, I could go all the way\nback and it's just behind my head.\n\n252\n00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:13.390\nBut I could go all the way back to the\nvery first time that we started this file.\n\n253\n00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:16.260\nIf I open that version,\nI just start with a blank workbook.\n\n254\n00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.900\nOkay, I just started with nothing there,\nsaved the file\n\n255\n00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:23.060\nup into my OneDrive account, and\nthen started the version history.\n\n256\n00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.490\nDid the sharing out, went ahead and\nshared with Justin and Joey and\n\n257\n00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:29.590\nVonne, and\nI could restore back to this point.\n\n258\n00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:34.410\nBut the cool thing is even if I restore it\nback to this point, all my other history,\n\n259\n00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:35.640\nit doesn't get erased.\n\n260\n00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:38.690\nIt's not like we're going all\nthe way back to the beginning, so\n\n261\n00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:39.942\neverything else is gone.\n\n262\n00:15:39.942 --> 00:15:41.390\nSo that's kind of cool, right?\n\n263\n00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:43.080\nSo you can kind of keep going back and\nforth.\n\n264\n00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.920\nIt might get a little confusing\nafter a little while.\n\n265\n00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:49.096\nWait, what point are we at and where did\nI start, and where did I go back to?\n\n266\n00:15:49.096 --> 00:15:52.382\nKind of like, [SOUND] but\nat least it logs it all.\n\n267\n00:15:52.382 --> 00:15:53.598\n&gt;&gt; And you can think of that as,\n\n268\n00:15:53.598 --> 00:15:56.794\nI've been taking pictures of what's\ngoing on, but then if I want to go back\n\n269\n00:15:56.794 --> 00:16:00.480\nin history, the next picture's\nactually the picture of the picture.\n\n270\n00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:04.060\nBut we're still moving forward in time.\n\n271\n00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:07.730\nIt gets kind of wonky, and\nversion control, and version history.\n\n272\n00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:09.275\nFor this, they all kind of work that way.\n\n273\n00:16:09.275 --> 00:16:12.895\nThe assumption is,\nyou're moving forward in time always, so\n\n274\n00:16:12.895 --> 00:16:16.350\nthe changes you make are always\ngonna be at the end.\n\n275\n00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:20.319\nBut it's kind of interesting,\nwe saw these people working together,\n\n276\n00:16:20.319 --> 00:16:24.632\nVonne, but I never actually saw where\ntwo things were saved at the same time.\n\n277\n00:16:24.632 --> 00:16:29.468\nIf I have multiple user documents,\nhow does version history play if, say,\n\n278\n00:16:29.468 --> 00:16:32.470\nyou and I were modifying the same sheet.\n\n279\n00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:36.089\nWe didn't do that a lot necessarily,\nbut what happens then?\n\n280\n00:16:36.089 --> 00:16:38.225\n&gt;&gt; That's a very good point and\n\n281\n00:16:38.225 --> 00:16:43.890\nthis is where your autosave can almost,\nI don't wanna say be a detriment.\n\n282\n00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:47.908\nBut basically, if you had multiple\npeople working on the same file,\n\n283\n00:16:47.908 --> 00:16:52.359\nlet's say we're editing the exact same\ncell and we change it differently.\n\n284\n00:16:52.359 --> 00:16:58.400\nWhoever changed it last as to when\nit was saved, that's who wins.\n\n285\n00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:02.282\nIt's like the last one, the last one\nstanding that's what's gonna go ahead and\n\n286\n00:17:02.282 --> 00:17:03.608\nsaved in version control.\n\n287\n00:17:03.608 --> 00:17:07.201\nAnd you might not see that we\nchange it 16 different times,\n\n288\n00:17:07.201 --> 00:17:09.510\njust whoever saved it last.\n\n289\n00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:13.010\nAnd with the autosave,\nyou don't really have\n\n290\n00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:17.610\nthat control over clicking the Save\nbutton, it's just doing it.\n\n291\n00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:21.030\nAnd we already know that it's\nkind of whenever it feels like,\n\n292\n00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:23.080\nputting the changes\nback up into the cloud.\n\n293\n00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:27.930\nSo that could be a little iffy,\nand maybe a little confusing,\n\n294\n00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:29.280\nespecially if you have multiple users.\n\n295\n00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.280\nI changed it, no, I changed,\nno, I swear I changed it.\n\n296\n00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:35.830\nAnd then you came and changed it after me,\nand that's what got saved in the history.\n\n297\n00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:40.260\nAnd you probably have to go back\nto a certain restore point, or\n\n298\n00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.410\nversion that you open.\n\n299\n00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:48.180\nAnd then, again, maybe it didn't get\nme all, it took me ten steps back?\n\n300\n00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:51.280\nI only really wanted to get five steps\nback, but hey, if I can get to here,\n\n301\n00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.990\nI can recreate and go forward.\n\n302\n00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:56.570\nSo that maybe comes back to the whole,\n\n303\n00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:59.010\ncommunicate with the people\nyou're collaborating with.\n\n304\n00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:02.442\nAnd make sure you have a game plan,\ntalk to people in real life.\n\n305\n00:18:02.442 --> 00:18:03.585\nI know it's hard sometimes,\n\n306\n00:18:03.585 --> 00:18:05.833\n[LAUGH] cuz you just wanna kind\nof hide behind the keyboard.\n\n307\n00:18:05.833 --> 00:18:08.880\nAnd it's like, I don't want to actually\nhave to talk to somebody face to face,\n\n308\n00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:09.610\nthat's too hard.\n\n309\n00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:15.345\nIt might be advantageous to you so\nyou don't step on each other's toes,\n\n310\n00:18:15.345 --> 00:18:17.838\nso that would be one.\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne,\n\n311\n00:18:17.838 --> 00:18:22.124\nthat's definitely a good\nthing to keep in mind, right?\n\n312\n00:18:22.124 --> 00:18:24.430\nThis actually happens\nwith version control.\n\n313\n00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:27.685\nWhen we use it, if we're all kind of\njust mucking around in the same place,\n\n314\n00:18:27.685 --> 00:18:29.197\nthen it can get all kinds of crazy.\n\n315\n00:18:29.197 --> 00:18:32.846\nNow Vonne, well, it seems like\nwe're kind of finished, am I right?\n\n316\n00:18:32.846 --> 00:18:34.334\nWe are for the most part, but\n\n317\n00:18:34.334 --> 00:18:38.870\nthere was one thing that I actually\nforgot to mention in the troubleshooting.\n\n318\n00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:43.461\nAt least, I think I forgot, this is where\nit'd be good for my version history,\n\n319\n00:18:43.461 --> 00:18:45.183\n[LAUGH] to see what I have done.\n\n320\n00:18:45.183 --> 00:18:50.000\nBut I wanted to point out something\nthat is in the version history, in here.\n\n321\n00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.283\nAnd I did it on purpose\nto show you right here.\n\n322\n00:18:53.283 --> 00:18:58.140\nDo you see where it says\nJoey Fatone shared the file?\n\n323\n00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:03.214\nWell, wait a second, I'm the owner,\nI'm JT, right, I'm Justin Timberlake.\n\n324\n00:19:03.214 --> 00:19:06.840\nSo why is Joey saving out the file?\n\n325\n00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:11.009\nAgain, I can't remember if I said this or\nnot yet, but when you give people,\n\n326\n00:19:11.009 --> 00:19:14.106\nwhen you're collaborating and\nsharing a document out.\n\n327\n00:19:14.106 --> 00:19:18.870\nJustin, you have the ability to go and\nshare that out with other people.\n\n328\n00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:24.213\nOkay, so Joey shared it out with, I think\nhe shared it with Lance or something.\n\n329\n00:19:24.213 --> 00:19:26.537\nOkay, well, as me as the owner,\n\n330\n00:19:26.537 --> 00:19:30.865\nmaybe I didn't want Joey to save\nthis out with Lance, right?\n\n331\n00:19:30.865 --> 00:19:36.095\nIt's like, I'm the owner, I should be the\none controlling, so be careful about that.\n\n332\n00:19:36.095 --> 00:19:40.435\nYour recipients of your shared\ndocuments can move along and\n\n333\n00:19:40.435 --> 00:19:42.353\nshare it to other people.\n\n334\n00:19:42.353 --> 00:19:46.213\nThe thing about it is that you,\nas the owner,\n\n335\n00:19:46.213 --> 00:19:50.390\nI don't get an alert automatically,\nlike hey.\n\n336\n00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:52.178\nIt's kind of like when you have credit\ncard fraud or something like that.\n\n337\n00:19:52.178 --> 00:19:55.120\nSomebody's used your card somewhere,\nwhere you're like what?\n\n338\n00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.525\nAnd it's in real time and\nthe bank texts you or something like that.\n\n339\n00:19:58.525 --> 00:20:01.046\nYou don't have that here,\nyou don't get an email.\n\n340\n00:20:01.046 --> 00:20:05.310\nIt doesn't say, hey,\nJoey shared it out with somebody, okay.\n\n341\n00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:07.318\nIt does log it, so you can see right here.\n\n342\n00:20:07.318 --> 00:20:11.476\nIt does note, it's telling in the history,\nJoey shared it out.\n\n343\n00:20:11.476 --> 00:20:17.086\nBut it's not gonna give you an alert\nwhile it's happening, okay?\n\n344\n00:20:17.086 --> 00:20:21.948\nJustin as the owner, Justin Timberlake,\nthat is, as the owner of the document,\n\n345\n00:20:21.948 --> 00:20:24.070\ncan go into the share permissions.\n\n346\n00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:27.150\nWe did this in the last episode where\nyou can go into your OneDrive account.\n\n347\n00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:31.399\nChange the sharing permissions,\nremove it or stop sharing altogether.\n\n348\n00:20:31.399 --> 00:20:34.760\nMaybe have a talk with Joey in\nthe office and everything like that.\n\n349\n00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:39.515\nBut do be aware that this is not\na closed circuit where you're\n\n350\n00:20:39.515 --> 00:20:41.947\nthe only that can share it out.\n\n351\n00:20:41.947 --> 00:20:44.720\nYou're giving them the permission\nto share it out as well.\n\n352\n00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:48.274\nAnd I would be able to see that,\nat least in the version history.\n\n353\n00:20:48.274 --> 00:20:52.863\nSo that would give you a little\nbit of an alert, cuz of course,\n\n354\n00:20:52.863 --> 00:20:57.452\nif Joey didn't tell you,\nat least you get some type of, hey,\n\n355\n00:20:57.452 --> 00:21:00.013\nbe careful.\n&gt;&gt; You get to play the blame game,\n\n356\n00:21:00.013 --> 00:21:01.046\nright?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n357\n00:21:01.046 --> 00:21:02.097\n&gt;&gt; You did it, I saw it,\n\n358\n00:21:02.097 --> 00:21:05.093\nand these are key points to remember,\nand it can be helpful.\n\n359\n00:21:05.093 --> 00:21:09.910\nBut luckily, as the owner of the document,\nyou can kind of put the kibosh on that.\n\n360\n00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:13.360\nSo definitely remember that and, well,\nversion history is very helpful.\n\n361\n00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.233\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nmake this episode history.\n\n362\n00:21:15.233 --> 00:21:18.450\nSo signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n363\n00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:18.963\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n364\n00:21:18.963 --> 00:21:19.628\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.558 --> 00:00:16.740\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n4\n00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.650\nAnd well, you better buckle up, because\nwe're coming back at you with more Excel\n\n5\n00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.844\n2016 Advanced for Mac, and we're gonna\nbe looking at data validation, luckily,\n\n6\n00:00:24.844 --> 00:00:28.868\nwe have someone in the studio who's gonna\ntake us on this magnificent journey, Ms.\n\n7\n00:00:28.868 --> 00:00:29.567\nVonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:29.567 --> 00:00:30.438\nHow are you doing today Vonne?\n\n9\n00:00:30.438 --> 00:00:31.136\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic.\n\n10\n00:00:31.136 --> 00:00:31.778\nHow you doiing?\n\n11\n00:00:31.778 --> 00:00:34.489\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic as well,\nand data validation,\n\n12\n00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.470\nseems like there might be a lot to that,\nor am I over thinking this a little bit?\n\n13\n00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.268\n&gt;&gt; Well, it can get pretty complicated,\nif you want to say.\n\n14\n00:00:44.268 --> 00:00:48.060\nBut we're gonna kinda keep\nit simple at first so\n\n15\n00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.880\nwe can kinda get the concept down.\n\n16\n00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.630\nWe'll get some examples of maybe\nsome more advanced data validation.\n\n17\n00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.487\nBut really what we're\ngonna do is validate data.\n\n18\n00:00:56.487 --> 00:00:58.870\nI know you love when I do that right?\n\n19\n00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.374\nBut this is more of okay say,\nwe're collaborating right?\n\n20\n00:01:02.374 --> 00:01:06.574\nAnd I need to make sure that\nyou are entering in our\n\n21\n00:01:06.574 --> 00:01:10.881\ndepartments correctly\nbecause we have marking,\n\n22\n00:01:10.881 --> 00:01:15.198\nwe have production and\nwe have customer service.\n\n23\n00:01:15.198 --> 00:01:19.679\nWe don't have the department of\nredundancy aid department, right.\n\n24\n00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:20.954\nThat's not a choice.\n\n25\n00:01:20.954 --> 00:01:28.530\nSo what can I do to prevent you from\ntyping that in to one of our cells?\n\n26\n00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.293\nThat's the type of data validation\nthat we are going to be doing.\n\n27\n00:01:32.293 --> 00:01:37.776\nI want put a constraint if you say,\non our cells so that way,\n\n28\n00:01:37.776 --> 00:01:43.276\nonly certain types of,\ndata will go ahead and get in there.\n\n29\n00:01:43.276 --> 00:01:47.270\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne with this particular\nexample would this also enforce like\n\n30\n00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.782\nwhen you type in the marketing department.\n\n31\n00:01:49.782 --> 00:01:53.781\nIt is spelled this way, and\nit's an uppercase, and those type things.\n\n32\n00:01:53.781 --> 00:01:56.826\nCould we also make sure\nthat that is enforced?\n\n33\n00:01:56.826 --> 00:02:00.190\nWe can by using a list, okay?\n\n34\n00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.320\nJust anything that you find online\nthere's little drop downs, right?\n\n35\n00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.310\nWhere we drop it down\nthere's these choices.\n\n36\n00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.079\nThese are only choices that you can\nchoose, that's what you can do, with data\n\n37\n00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:15.917\nvalidation is we can put rules on there or\ncriteria that says, I'm going to make\n\n38\n00:02:15.917 --> 00:02:20.923\na list, a physical drop down list of these\nare the things that you can choose from.\n\n39\n00:02:20.923 --> 00:02:22.783\n&gt;&gt; So\nyes that's where we can constrain it.\n\n40\n00:02:22.783 --> 00:02:27.369\nWe could also do things like hey maybe\nour invoice numbers like we're tracking\n\n41\n00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:30.230\ninvoices, well they can\nonly be whole numbers.\n\n42\n00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.179\nYou can't have invoice 2.5\nit just doesn't exist.\n\n43\n00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:38.431\nI want my zip codes to be five digits\nI don't want the extra extensions.\n\n44\n00:02:38.431 --> 00:02:42.722\nThe date has to be within\na certain parameter,\n\n45\n00:02:42.722 --> 00:02:49.774\nall of those things that we need to limit\nin how that against imputed into it.\n\n46\n00:02:49.774 --> 00:02:53.729\nAnd so that's why I put it in those\ncollaborating in security topic because\n\n47\n00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:57.998\nit's probably gonna be the place where\nit's gonna be most apparent it's like if\n\n48\n00:02:57.998 --> 00:03:01.560\nwe have multiple people,\nworking on the same workbook.\n\n49\n00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.520\nOr maybe it's like, I need to put rules\nfor myself cuz I can't remember them or\n\n50\n00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.127\nwhatever.\n\n51\n00:03:06.127 --> 00:03:10.501\nI mean so you can put them on\nworkbooks that only you use for\n\n52\n00:03:10.501 --> 00:03:14.420\nwhatever purpose, but\nhopefully, if it's you,\n\n53\n00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.819\nyou're gonna control how it goes in any\nways, but, you might forget after a year.\n\n54\n00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.381\nAnd you might come back later and\nbe like, why is, yeah,\n\n55\n00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:25.140\nI put that data validation on it, so.\n\n56\n00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.253\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne, I can definitely see\nhow this is gonna enforce consistency.\n\n57\n00:03:29.253 --> 00:03:32.264\nWhich is just ultimately gonna\nmake not only my life easier, but\n\n58\n00:03:32.264 --> 00:03:36.224\nif we're working together, it'll make\nsure that we have an agreed-upon kind of,\n\n59\n00:03:36.224 --> 00:03:38.540\nthis is how we're doing it, don't mess up.\n\n60\n00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.810\nBecause it could have some\nlong-term ramifications,\n\n61\n00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.120\nI've actually worked with some data where\npeople were like, well, I did it this way.\n\n62\n00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.540\nI did it this other way.\n\n63\n00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.350\nI did it this other way.\n\n64\n00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.340\nAnd then somehow it ended up\nbeing Justin's job to fix it, and\n\n65\n00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.161\nit was not fun.\n\n66\n00:03:52.161 --> 00:03:54.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's definitely\nwhat we're going to avoid.\n\n67\n00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.669\nSo why don't we go ahead and get started?\n\n68\n00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:00.566\nI have a file called data validation.\n\n69\n00:04:00.566 --> 00:04:04.657\nAnd we'll going ahead and open it up,\nI'm gonna give you come examples first, so\n\n70\n00:04:04.657 --> 00:04:07.857\nyou can see it in action and\nthen I'll show you how to created it,\n\n71\n00:04:07.857 --> 00:04:09.420\nand maybe some other options.\n\n72\n00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.889\nSo right here, like I said before,\ninvoice numbers,\n\n73\n00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:19.327\nI want it to be a whole number, so\nif I said the invoice number is 5,\n\n74\n00:04:19.327 --> 00:04:22.942\nno problem, 3, 9, 1, okay, 7.4.\n\n75\n00:04:22.942 --> 00:04:24.858\nNo, you can't do that.\n\n76\n00:04:24.858 --> 00:04:27.494\nIt does not match the data\nvalidation restriction.\n\n77\n00:04:27.494 --> 00:04:31.231\nSo this warning dialog box tells me that,\nokay,\n\n78\n00:04:31.231 --> 00:04:37.249\ndata validation has been enforced, and\nit doesn't match what type of rules or\n\n79\n00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:42.070\ncriteria that have been put\nonto this particular cell.\n\n80\n00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.810\nAnd the only options I have\nhere is I can cancel, and\n\n81\n00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.050\nthen you see how it takes it away, or if\nI try it again I'll do 7.4, and then hit\n\n82\n00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.470\nenter cuz it's when I'm trying to exit the\ncell, that's when this validation happens.\n\n83\n00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.430\nSo I hit either enter, or I hit, the tab\nkey, or I just try to click onto another\n\n84\n00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.252\ncell with my mouse,\nthat's when this is gonna come up.\n\n85\n00:05:02.252 --> 00:05:05.837\nSo cancel took it away,\nretry just highlights it and\n\n86\n00:05:05.837 --> 00:05:09.430\nsays well then I'm gonna\ngive you another try at it.\n\n87\n00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.883\nSo I type in nine, and then I pass.\n\n88\n00:05:11.883 --> 00:05:17.378\nOkay so there was no way it was\ngonna allow me to put in a decimal,\n\n89\n00:05:17.378 --> 00:05:22.282\nokay so that is the type of\nwarning that it is telling me.\n\n90\n00:05:22.282 --> 00:05:27.306\nNow, on this date, we get a other\npart of data validates that you\n\n91\n00:05:27.306 --> 00:05:32.054\ncan put on yourselves, and\nnotice it's like a little hint,\n\n92\n00:05:32.054 --> 00:05:37.009\nlook, the date must be after January 1,\n2001, cool.\n\n93\n00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:41.620\nSo, that's another part that you can\ndo is give them a little guidance.\n\n94\n00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:47.090\nSo, if I type in 2-2- 02 that's a date\noops okay I should go ahead and\n\n95\n00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.871\nput the 0 in there too.\n\n96\n00:05:48.871 --> 00:05:54.367\nI pass, 1- 1- 85.\n\n97\n00:05:54.367 --> 00:05:59.419\nNo doesn't match okay so\nyou see that that's where we have a hint,\n\n98\n00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:04.577\nwe also have our warning, and\nthen it lets me know what's going on.\n\n99\n00:06:04.577 --> 00:06:05.810\nThe drop down right?\n\n100\n00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.930\nThe whole, I wanna make sure that\nyou type in marketing correctly,\n\n101\n00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.429\nwell if I drop this down, here are the\noptions that I have for these cells.\n\n102\n00:06:14.429 --> 00:06:17.669\nSo I choose customer services,\nI come in here,\n\n103\n00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:20.267\nmaybe I try to type in Justin, right?\n\n104\n00:06:20.267 --> 00:06:24.099\nThe department of Justin and\nthen I hit enter and it says.\n\n105\n00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:27.333\nUse a drop down,\nit's there for a reason people,\n\n106\n00:06:27.333 --> 00:06:30.650\nwow that's getting a little\nsassy on us isn't it?\n\n107\n00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:35.184\nYeah, that's because you can\ncreate custom warnings, or\n\n108\n00:06:35.184 --> 00:06:39.444\nerror messages when you go ahead and\ntype it in wrong, so\n\n109\n00:06:39.444 --> 00:06:45.720\nI could create anything I want to say in\nthat, maybe not be this spicy with people.\n\n110\n00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.992\n&gt;&gt; No, I was getting ready to say,\n\n111\n00:06:46.992 --> 00:06:49.471\nI didn't know that Excel came\nwith that much built-in sass.\n\n112\n00:06:49.471 --> 00:06:50.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was like, wow,\n\n113\n00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.160\nbut they're right, right?\n\n114\n00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.450\nYou should use the drop-down.\n\n115\n00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.170\nNow, I do have a question\nabout this drop-down.\n\n116\n00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.183\nAnd maybe I'm jumping ahead here,\nmaybe I'm taking your thunder.\n\n117\n00:06:59.183 --> 00:07:03.120\nIf I start typing a valid option,\ndo I get autocomplete?\n\n118\n00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.220\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't look like it,\n\n119\n00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:13.610\nin this particular one like in Excel\nlike if you have the same values in it,\n\n120\n00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.140\nand you start typing it\nautomatically starts to populate.\n\n121\n00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.910\nIn this one it doesn't look like it.\n\n122\n00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.300\nNow if I typed in marketing, look at that.\n\n123\n00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.640\nI did type it in and\nit did accept it as lowercase.\n\n124\n00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.993\nI think you just found a glitch\nin the matrix there so.\n\n125\n00:07:30.993 --> 00:07:33.385\n&gt;&gt; I knew I should've stayed\naway from those blue pills.\n\n126\n00:07:33.385 --> 00:07:38.323\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But now if you really wanted\nto there is when we get into some\n\n127\n00:07:38.323 --> 00:07:40.244\nmore advanced options,\n\n128\n00:07:40.244 --> 00:07:45.273\nthere could be a way that we could\nsay it has to be this particular,\n\n129\n00:07:45.273 --> 00:07:50.865\nlike it has to be upper case or\nsentence case, and those types of things.\n\n130\n00:07:50.865 --> 00:07:55.287\nSo with a combination of\nsome more advance features,\n\n131\n00:07:55.287 --> 00:07:58.145\nwe can probably make that happen.\n\n132\n00:07:58.145 --> 00:07:59.415\n&gt;&gt; Follow up questions.\n\n133\n00:07:59.415 --> 00:08:00.935\nIt doesn't auto complete\nwith a lowercase m.\n\n134\n00:08:00.935 --> 00:08:03.869\nIf we type an uppercase M,\ndoes it do that now?\n\n135\n00:08:03.869 --> 00:08:06.680\nOr it does it now because the previous\none is already there, right?\n\n136\n00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.020\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yes, so\nif it was all ready in it, and\n\n137\n00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.240\nthat's just the built in\nfunctionality of Excel,\n\n138\n00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.460\nit's seeing other entries and\nit's trying to auto complete for you.\n\n139\n00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:21.934\nSo in that sense, yes, it would work,\nokay, good question so.\n\n140\n00:08:21.934 --> 00:08:27.280\nAnd the we'll go ahead and say 1,\n2, 3, 4, 5, that's 5 digits,\n\n141\n00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.708\nand then, if I type in 12, nope,\nthis one's a little bit nicer.\n\n142\n00:08:31.708 --> 00:08:33.465\nIt must be five digits.\n\n143\n00:08:33.465 --> 00:08:35.501\nPlease conform to the standard.\n\n144\n00:08:35.501 --> 00:08:37.678\nI was trying to be a little\nnicer on this one, but\n\n145\n00:08:37.678 --> 00:08:40.469\nnotice that our little buttons\ndon't say cancel and retry.\n\n146\n00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:43.404\nThey say yes and no,\nand you say okay, well,\n\n147\n00:08:43.404 --> 00:08:47.747\nthank you, you hit yes but\nit's still allowing me to type in 12.\n\n148\n00:08:47.747 --> 00:08:51.418\nSo there's different types of\nerror warnings that you can do,\n\n149\n00:08:51.418 --> 00:08:53.773\nones that are a little bit more like hey,\n\n150\n00:08:53.773 --> 00:08:57.970\nI'm just kinda gently telling you\nthat this is what you need to do.\n\n151\n00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:01.940\nBut I'll allow you to do it versus no,\n\n152\n00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:05.460\nyou either retry or\nI'm taking it away or cancel.\n\n153\n00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:10.580\nSo different levels of reprimand,\nwe'll say, for that.\n\n154\n00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.380\nThat's it in action.\n\n155\n00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:19.130\nSo, there's three pieces, the criteria,\nthe input message, and the error message.\n\n156\n00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:22.223\nSo, those three parts,\nyou don't have to do all three of them.\n\n157\n00:09:22.223 --> 00:09:25.130\nNotice I did not put a hint on this one.\n\n158\n00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:26.650\nI put a hint on this one.\n\n159\n00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:29.050\nI changed custom error messages.\n\n160\n00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:31.939\nThis one I did not customize\nthe error message.\n\n161\n00:09:31.939 --> 00:09:34.300\nIt just gave the default one from Excel.\n\n162\n00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:38.200\nSo you can mix and\nmatch those pieces that you want.\n\n163\n00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.480\nSo we're gonna create a data\nvalidation for your cells.\n\n164\n00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.510\nOne, you have to select it, okay, and\nfor me, I would probably go ahead and\n\n165\n00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:47.430\nsay, I'd like this whole column to be.\n\n166\n00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:52.360\nYes, there's a header in there,\nlike a heading in that first row.\n\n167\n00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.020\nWe'll still go ahead and put\nthe validation rules on the entire column.\n\n168\n00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:59.830\nSo I'll go over to our data tab and\nthere's our data validation.\n\n169\n00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:03.570\nNow there is a drop down that has some\nother things that we'll talk about,\n\n170\n00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:09.910\nwhere it can circle different data that is\nnot adhering to the rules after the fact.\n\n171\n00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:14.540\nWe're doing this before the fact,\nbefore we input any information.\n\n172\n00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.037\nSo, and I'm gonna keep this basic for\nright now.\n\n173\n00:10:17.037 --> 00:10:21.770\nWe go to Data Validation, and\nthen there's the three buttons at the top.\n\n174\n00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.810\nWe have the Settings, set the criteria,\n\n175\n00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:29.680\nwhat do you want that input message, and\nwhat do you want your error alert to be?\n\n176\n00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:35.210\nNotice the style, the stop versus\nthe warning and information?\n\n177\n00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:37.900\nThe one that was the yes,\nno, that was the warning.\n\n178\n00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:41.110\nThe stop was the one that said cancel and\nretry.\n\n179\n00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:45.180\nAnd where it was bold as the title,\nand then the actual message,\n\n180\n00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:46.980\nthat's where you could go ahead and\nchange that.\n\n181\n00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.970\nSo that's decently straightforward.\n\n182\n00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:52.020\nLet's come back over here to the Settings.\n\n183\n00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.580\nSo let's go ahead and look at it.\n\n184\n00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.459\nWhat do I want to limit this?\n\n185\n00:10:55.459 --> 00:10:58.521\nNow this is very similar\nto Number formats,\n\n186\n00:10:58.521 --> 00:11:01.680\nlike we're actually changing how it looks.\n\n187\n00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:07.080\nBut this gets into a whole level\nof what is allowed to be inputted,\n\n188\n00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.540\nnot just what it looks like.\n\n189\n00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:15.070\nSo, do I allow whole numbers, decimals,\nand all of these besides custom?\n\n190\n00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:20.577\nIf I choose one of them, let's say whole\nnumber, notice then I have an option\n\n191\n00:11:20.577 --> 00:11:25.850\nof the, I guess we would say the logical\noperators, what do we call that?\n\n192\n00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:28.860\nGreater than or less than equal to.\n\n193\n00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:32.000\n&gt;&gt; Some of those are comparison operators.\n\n194\n00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.279\nThey're typically for respective data\ntypes between and not between, or actually\n\n195\n00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:43.090\nsimplified versions of between means,\nit's greater than this and less than this.\n\n196\n00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:47.480\nAnd then not between,\nit's greater than the upper bound,\n\n197\n00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.120\nless than the lower bound.\n\n198\n00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.010\nSo some of this are just niceness for you.\n\n199\n00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:55.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I'm thinking cuz I know you\ncome from a programming background where\n\n200\n00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:59.390\nwe do the logical expressions and\nall of those different things.\n\n201\n00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:03.550\nSo I know it has technical names, but\nwe're basically saying, is it equal to,\n\n202\n00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:05.900\nnot equal to, between,\ngreater than, less than?\n\n203\n00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:10.320\nAnd then if I look at, say,\ndecimal, it's the same thing.\n\n204\n00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:14.437\nIf I look at date, same thing, okay?\n\n205\n00:12:14.437 --> 00:12:17.645\nThe only thing that changes like start and\nend, but\n\n206\n00:12:17.645 --> 00:12:22.868\nthe Data dropdown of what I'm trying to\ndo, our comparisons, and our criterias,\n\n207\n00:12:22.868 --> 00:12:27.440\nit's gonna be the same for the time and\nyou could see what the text links.\n\n208\n00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:32.180\nSo all of that is gonna be the same,\nit's really, this is, in this one,\n\n209\n00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:36.360\nit's almost like we're doing a data type,\nright?\n\n210\n00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:40.730\nWhether it's a number, or it's text,\nor it's a date, or a time.\n\n211\n00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:45.080\nSo those are the only major\ndifferences between here.\n\n212\n00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.930\nSo I'm gonna start with a whole number.\n\n213\n00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:51.694\nWe are going to do, let's do greater\nthan because the whole number\n\n214\n00:12:51.694 --> 00:12:54.936\nmakes it where it doesn't accept decimals.\n\n215\n00:12:54.936 --> 00:13:00.925\nThe greater than, maybe I can't have\nan invoice number that's less than zero,\n\n216\n00:13:00.925 --> 00:13:03.990\nso it has to be greater than zero.\n\n217\n00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:07.420\nSo really one or anything above that.\n\n218\n00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.760\nSo pretty simple, there we go.\n\n219\n00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.410\nI went ahead and did that.\n\n220\n00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:16.350\nIf I wanted to put in an error message or\nsorry, input message, not an error,\n\n221\n00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:21.290\nthen this is like that hint that I could\nlet them say, must be greater than,\n\n222\n00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:24.791\nactually, you know what,\nthis needs to go down here.\n\n223\n00:13:24.791 --> 00:13:29.793\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and\ncommand x and then command v,\n\n224\n00:13:29.793 --> 00:13:34.600\ncut and paste,\nthe title will be like, Kint, right?\n\n225\n00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.660\nYou can say whatever you want, right?\n\n226\n00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:40.647\nMust be greater than 0 and whole number.\n\n227\n00:13:40.647 --> 00:13:41.491\nAnd so, give them a little warning.\n\n228\n00:13:41.491 --> 00:13:45.672\nGive them a little guidance in here.\n\n229\n00:13:45.672 --> 00:13:50.864\nYou might make it to where they don't\nget as frustrated when they see\n\n230\n00:13:50.864 --> 00:13:56.071\nyour error message where I said hey,\n[LAUGH] did you not see the hint?\n\n231\n00:13:56.071 --> 00:13:58.880\nDid you not see the hint?\n\n232\n00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.650\nThat's being a little sassy, right?\n\n233\n00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:06.592\nYou might wanna curtail that a little bit,\nbe a little professional and say, nope,\n\n234\n00:14:06.592 --> 00:14:09.737\nlet's go back and\nlook at what I just told you, okay?\n\n235\n00:14:09.737 --> 00:14:12.670\nSo those are the different things\nthat I can go ahead and do.\n\n236\n00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:15.020\nAnd notice that I do have this turned on.\n\n237\n00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:18.110\nYou can check it off,\nthen they wouldn't even see an error.\n\n238\n00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:20.730\nThat would be kind of mean,\nwouldn't it, Justin?\n\n239\n00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:23.650\nIf like, why is this not working?\n\n240\n00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:26.511\n&gt;&gt; That seems like it\nwould defeat the purpose,\n\n241\n00:14:26.511 --> 00:14:28.845\nespecially if you're doing a stop,\n\n242\n00:14:28.845 --> 00:14:33.831\nbecause you have to conform to something\nin order to actually input the value.\n\n243\n00:14:33.831 --> 00:14:36.602\nAnd you're not giving, I don't know.\n\n244\n00:14:36.602 --> 00:14:38.560\nI would probably keep that checked for\nthe most part.\n\n245\n00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you wanna give feedback, okay?\n\n246\n00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:42.960\nSo I would say keep these ones on.\n\n247\n00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.590\nSo I'm gonna click OK,\nand then there you go.\n\n248\n00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:49.550\nYou can see that now I\nhave enforced this rule.\n\n249\n00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:53.323\nI've got an input, I type in 5 and fine.\n\n250\n00:14:53.323 --> 00:15:00.690\n-7, no, that's where the error message\ncomes in and then I can cancel or retry.\n\n251\n00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:04.521\nAnd we can do the same thing\non all of these, right?\n\n252\n00:15:04.521 --> 00:15:09.193\nI could do the Date, right,\nit has to be after January 1st,\n\n253\n00:15:09.193 --> 00:15:12.415\n2001, the zip code, the text link.\n\n254\n00:15:12.415 --> 00:15:15.211\nLet's go ahead and\nI'll just do this one really quick.\n\n255\n00:15:15.211 --> 00:15:20.706\nSo why don't I go ahead and\nsay that the data validation,\n\n256\n00:15:20.706 --> 00:15:26.400\nit has to be a text length\nthat is equal to 5 characters.\n\n257\n00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.792\nZip codes are 5 characters, so that's one.\n\n258\n00:15:29.792 --> 00:15:34.184\nAnd I'm also doing text links on zip codes\nbecause we want those preceding zeros and\n\n259\n00:15:34.184 --> 00:15:35.260\neverything there.\n\n260\n00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.800\nSo that's how I would go ahead and\nput this.\n\n261\n00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.940\nI'm not gonna put an input or\nan error message,\n\n262\n00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.540\nit'll just give me the default ones.\n\n263\n00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.301\nAnd then I will click OK.\n\n264\n00:15:44.301 --> 00:15:45.550\nAnd then there you go.\n\n265\n00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:50.650\nSo betweens, you have ranges, greater\nthan or equal to, less than or equal to.\n\n266\n00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:53.921\nAnd then our text link that\nhas to be five characters.\n\n267\n00:15:53.921 --> 00:15:57.376\nJustin, I feel like you have\na puzzling look over there.\n\n268\n00:15:57.376 --> 00:16:01.072\n&gt;&gt; That's actually not what I\nanticipated with zip codes,\n\n269\n00:16:01.072 --> 00:16:04.465\nI I figured it was gonna be\nsome kinda numeric value.\n\n270\n00:16:04.465 --> 00:16:09.450\nWhat if I wanted the four digit extension,\nlike dash blah, blah, blah?\n\n271\n00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:11.490\nThen this kinda keeps that from happening.\n\n272\n00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:13.090\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it does.\n\n273\n00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.250\nSee it says I have to.\n\n274\n00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:18.980\nIt will only allow you\nto do five characters.\n\n275\n00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.660\nSo if I did one two,\nnope you can not do that.\n\n276\n00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:25.470\nIf I do more than that,\nthat is not going to allow it.\n\n277\n00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:29.400\nSo this is where it is like,\nbecause you can you can not, no.\n\n278\n00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.160\nI am only giving you five.\n\n279\n00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.510\nYou can only have five characters.\n\n280\n00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:35.620\nSo that is where I am limiting,\n\n281\n00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:40.530\nin this particular example I gotta\ncancel this, so there we go.\n\n282\n00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:45.540\n&gt;&gt; Now what if instead you change\nthis from a stop to a warning\n\n283\n00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:48.000\nlike is there a difference there?\n\n284\n00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.650\nCuz now this is making me think there\nmight be a valid use case of being like\n\n285\n00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:53.860\nI know but I don't care.\n\n286\n00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:58.644\n&gt;&gt; This is where if I want\nthis to warning, right, and\n\n287\n00:16:58.644 --> 00:17:03.671\nI said, and we'll just say for\nJustin, here you go.\n\n288\n00:17:03.671 --> 00:17:07.400\n[LAUGH] And I click OK.\n\n289\n00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:15.610\nNow, if I type in 1234- those,\nis that 12, yeah okay Okay.\n\n290\n00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:20.340\nYou're supposed to do it, but if I click\nyes, it will allow me to enter in.\n\n291\n00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:25.480\nBut then, this is where you have to,\nwhich one's more important.\n\n292\n00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.710\nThe constraints.\n\n293\n00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:29.010\nYou can only do five characters and\n\n294\n00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:33.605\nI cannot allow you to do anything else,\nor the gentle hinting.\n\n295\n00:17:33.605 --> 00:17:36.630\n&gt;&gt; Alright, so\nthis makes me think of another thing.\n\n296\n00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:41.295\nWhat if I type abcdef, and\nhit Enter, and hit Yes now?\n\n297\n00:17:41.295 --> 00:17:44.665\n&gt;&gt; A-B-C-D-E, the five, right?\n\n298\n00:17:44.665 --> 00:17:47.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think I skipped E when I said that\n\n299\n00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:48.010\none out loud.\n\n300\n00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:53.190\n&gt;&gt; That's not what I expected.\n\n301\n00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:55.250\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you want them to be numbers,\ndon't you.\n\n302\n00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:56.640\n&gt;&gt; I do want them to be numbers.\n\n303\n00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.690\n&gt;&gt; You do, exactly.\n\n304\n00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:58.910\n&gt;&gt; Except for that dash.\n\n305\n00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:01.590\nA dash isn't a number,\nbut I would allow it.\n\n306\n00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:04.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well,\nwe're gonna leave the dash thing and for\n\n307\n00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.610\na whole other, [LAUGH] whole other level.\n\n308\n00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:13.120\nBut you are alluding to hey, but\nthat's another criteria, isn't it?\n\n309\n00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:18.060\nI'm saying it needs to be five but\nit has to be a number.\n\n310\n00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:21.870\nBecause the criteria,\nit only said text length, didn't it?\n\n311\n00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:27.380\nSo text could be a number or\na character, right?\n\n312\n00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:30.740\nSo that's a problem.\n\n313\n00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:36.180\nAnd this is where we have in these\nexamples these are just some kinda basic\n\n314\n00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:40.300\ncriteria that we could go ahead and\nput for our data validation.\n\n315\n00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:47.270\nBut you can go a little beyond that okay?\n\n316\n00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:51.770\nYou could go into what are known as\nI am calling it just advanced or\n\n317\n00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:53.040\nmultiple criterias.\n\n318\n00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.690\nBecause right now that was\nonly a single criteria right?\n\n319\n00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:57.490\nJust text length of five.\n\n320\n00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:01.230\nI guess you could say like\nbetween start date and end date.\n\n321\n00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:04.690\nIt has to be between those almost\ntwo criteria's but it's kind of not.\n\n322\n00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:07.460\n&gt;&gt; So this is where it got odd.\n\n323\n00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:11.700\nI'm just gonna say cool but\nthere seem to be like\n\n324\n00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.550\nthere was that logical operate\nlike greater than or between.\n\n325\n00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:17.920\nThere was an implicit like and\nor behind there.\n\n326\n00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:22.860\nI was like, well, can I say,\nI wanna text length of five and\n\n327\n00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:28.100\nit has to be numeric or\nI want a text length of five or\n\n328\n00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:32.960\na text length of ten with a dash, I don't\nknow could it do something like that?\n\n329\n00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.298\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's what that does.\n\n330\n00:19:34.298 --> 00:19:39.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah so\nwhat I'm trying to get at is you can use\n\n331\n00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:45.630\ndata validation in conjunction\nwith functions within Excel.\n\n332\n00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:51.850\nAnd since this is not an episode\nabout functions in general,\n\n333\n00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:53.750\nI just wanted to go ahead and\nthrow this in.\n\n334\n00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:58.420\nAnd I took these and copied it straight\nfrom when you do an insert function and\n\n335\n00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:02.280\nit gives you the little definition at the\nbottom, I just copied it from From excel.\n\n336\n00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:05.120\nSo something like is number, right,\n\n337\n00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.970\nthat is a function in Excel,\nthat checks whether value is a number.\n\n338\n00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:14.580\nAnd then a today,\ntoday is a returns the current date.\n\n339\n00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:18.830\nAnd, that's what you were asking\nabout right, it has to have.\n\n340\n00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:21.040\nAll of these arguments.\n\n341\n00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:25.390\nSo these are different things, it returns\nthe length, it count if maybe I want it\n\n342\n00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:29.990\nhas to be unique, it has to be a number,\nand it has to be five characters.\n\n343\n00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:32.760\nI mean you could put\nmultiple criteria on it,\n\n344\n00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:36.510\nI just went with something\nthat's a little bit smaller.\n\n345\n00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:39.950\nIn a sense like I want it right here, for\n\n346\n00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:44.700\nthis particular cell this is what's\nactually written in this data validation.\n\n347\n00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:51.110\nIt has to have a link E\n18 is the cell of 5 and\n\n348\n00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:57.580\nit is a number, and look at the value\nwhat's in E 18 and see is it a number.\n\n349\n00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:04.050\nOkay so that would allow me to\nsay 4 okay that's not gonna work,\n\n350\n00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:12.388\nokay retry 12345 that worked by\nthe O-N-N-E no it doesn't work.\n\n351\n00:21:12.388 --> 00:21:17.210\nSo you can use a function, or\n\n352\n00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:22.920\nwrite a formula out to allow it to\n\n353\n00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:27.700\ndo some of those more advanced\ntypes of multiple criteria, or\n\n354\n00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:32.530\nsomething that's a little bit more\nbeyond just what is given to you.\n\n355\n00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:34.740\nAnd that's where,\nif I look at the data validation so\n\n356\n00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.720\nwe can see it It is a custom,\n\n357\n00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:42.590\nnotice that this drop down is not allowed\nanymore so you have to write this out.\n\n358\n00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:46.720\nOkay, so you've gotta know\nthe syntax this is where it's\n\n359\n00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:52.250\na little bit more advanced than just\nthe drop downs, it can be done.\n\n360\n00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:55.880\nYou just got to be careful about your\nsyntax, knowing how your functions work,\n\n361\n00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:58.290\nand how it's going to behave.\n\n362\n00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:00.320\n&gt;&gt; Real quick question.\n\n363\n00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.920\nI'm guessing this is not exhaustive,\ncuz we have an and, but\n\n364\n00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.050\nI'm just making an assumption here.\n\n365\n00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:08.210\nWe have an or and a not and\nall these other logical operations.\n\n366\n00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:13.630\nSo these expressions could get\nfairly complicated, could they not?\n\n367\n00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:15.370\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah.\n\n368\n00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:17.580\nExactly what you're talking about.\n\n369\n00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:21.660\nAll the logical functions and\nhow you nest them together.\n\n370\n00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:26.870\nIf this and that, all of that, I know your\ncoding brain is going crazy right now.\n\n371\n00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:30.180\nThis is as far as I'm going\nto show you right now.\n\n372\n00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:34.330\nSo yes, you can crazy with this stuff.\n\n373\n00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:39.260\nIt is possible I would do some\nextensive searches on them to\n\n374\n00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:42.690\nget a little bit more of the information\nabout what you would want it to do.\n\n375\n00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:46.420\n&gt;&gt; Followup question I\n\n376\n00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:49.900\nsaw there that that's making sure\nthe length of that specific cell.\n\n377\n00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:53.630\nWill that custom just automatically\napply it to a whole column?\n\n378\n00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:57.510\n&gt;&gt; That's where I was just doing it for\na single cell but\n\n379\n00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:02.080\nyou can say look at the whole column.\n\n380\n00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:06.260\nIt would be like e colon e,\nlike look at the whole thing.\n\n381\n00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:10.330\nYeah so I was doing it cuz now\nI just wanna show one cell, but\n\n382\n00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:13.540\nin here you would just say\nlook at the entire column.\n\n383\n00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:16.220\nOkay.\nAnd that's where just the syntax.\n\n384\n00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:19.930\nI didn't want to get too deep into the\nsyntax, but yes you can totally do that.\n\n385\n00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:22.040\n&gt;&gt; And that's totally understandable.\n\n386\n00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.600\nI just wanted to make sure it wasn't\none of those things where you had to\n\n387\n00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.390\nuse a weird fill thing,\nor something like that.\n\n388\n00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:28.900\nBut you just say, look at this column, and\n\n389\n00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:31.190\nit's going to evaluate\non a cell by cell basis.\n\n390\n00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:32.120\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; And we're all good.\n\n391\n00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.670\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n392\n00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:38.030\nAnd you can also use this for this\nparticular one, like if I wanted dates to\n\n393\n00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:43.120\nbe all right between it has to be 30 days\nbefore today's date and 30 days after.\n\n394\n00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:46.550\nCuz think about it like that's\nsomething's gonna change every day.\n\n395\n00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:50.121\nSo it can only be 30 days before,\n30 days after.\n\n396\n00:23:50.121 --> 00:23:54.511\nSo that type of thing is where\nit's still using here but\n\n397\n00:23:54.511 --> 00:23:56.903\nit put in the function right.\n\n398\n00:23:56.903 --> 00:24:01.855\nAnd it's actually saying today minus\n30 like hard coding the number 30.\n\n399\n00:24:01.855 --> 00:24:06.521\nCombining it with a function, so\nit can do a lot of things within these\n\n400\n00:24:06.521 --> 00:24:10.660\nnormal dropdowns it doesn't\nalways have to be with custom.\n\n401\n00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:15.510\nSo functions can do a lot for\nyou with your validation, it\n\n402\n00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:20.790\njust it does take it into a different kind\nof an echelon if we would like to say.\n\n403\n00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:22.550\nSo clicking on that, that's cool.\n\n404\n00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:26.930\nOne thing that I did wanna point\nout that I didn't totally get to\n\n405\n00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:28.500\nwas that you can use cell references.\n\n406\n00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:31.530\nAnd actually, one that we have not\ndone was that drop-down, right?\n\n407\n00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:32.620\nWe wanna make this drop down.\n\n408\n00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:36.290\nSo if I come back over here\nto create the validation,\n\n409\n00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:42.760\nI will select this whole column and I will\ngo over to, I wanna make this a list.\n\n410\n00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:44.160\nWell, I can't.\n\n411\n00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:48.390\nYou can, but I'd rather go ahead and\npull from the cells.\n\n412\n00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:54.100\nInstead of me hard-coding the number five\nor a date, I can use a cell reference.\n\n413\n00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.320\nAnd this is one that you\nwould definitely want to use.\n\n414\n00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:00.700\nSo you'd have to type in\nyour values somewhere.\n\n415\n00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:03.530\nSo I've got them in a worksheet\nthat's called values, okay?\n\n416\n00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:07.920\nSo I gotta make sure that I put\nmy cursor into the source field.\n\n417\n00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:08.650\nThat's always number one.\n\n418\n00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:10.960\nYou gotta make sure your\nflashing cursor's there.\n\n419\n00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.790\nAnd then you just navigate out and\nselect it.\n\n420\n00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:14.810\nSo I click on the worksheet.\n\n421\n00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:18.550\nTypes in, like equals values\nthat's the name of the sheet.\n\n422\n00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:22.580\nHere are those cells, click hold and\ndrag down, and then there you go.\n\n423\n00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:27.710\nSo I'm using cell references\nrather than typing in the values.\n\n424\n00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:32.900\nAgain, it can be used for\nany of the criterias that you're setting.\n\n425\n00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:38.520\nSo now that I've got, yep, the values\nare from C4 through C7 I click okay,\n\n426\n00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:41.740\nnow I will have those\ncute little drop downs.\n\n427\n00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:46.420\nSo pretty neat, I have a lot of people\nthat always want to make drop down lists\n\n428\n00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:51.230\nin Excel and that's how you do it,\nyou do it with your data validation.\n\n429\n00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:55.970\nNow a few of the things that we have with\ndata validation is alright that was all\n\n430\n00:25:55.970 --> 00:26:01.780\nbefore hand right, what about I've\ngot stuff that's already typed in and\n\n431\n00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:05.220\nI need to see where the errors are,\nwhether this is a whole number.\n\n432\n00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:08.740\nWhether this is a date that's\nafter January 1st 2001.\n\n433\n00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:09.510\nI think I put.\n\n434\n00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:12.740\nDo I have zipcodes?\n\n435\n00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:17.460\nSo this drop down where I have circle\ninvalid data I'm gonna show you that this\n\n436\n00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:21.500\nis gonna happen automatically like magic\nbecause I already put the rules on it.\n\n437\n00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:24.810\nI'll show you in a second but\nlet me just show you that it will circle.\n\n438\n00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:30.080\nIt does take a little bit of time cuz it\nis looking at your entire work sheet and\n\n439\n00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.350\nhaving to process every cell.\n\n440\n00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:33.180\nAnd there we go.\n\n441\n00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:37.860\nLook, I've got a problem here and here\nbecause if I look at this whole column.\n\n442\n00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:39.200\nIf I click on it.\n\n443\n00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.900\nAnd then go to data validation,\nI already get this, okay.\n\n444\n00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:49.240\nSo you can apply data validation rules\nto your information of the fact,\n\n445\n00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:55.270\nit will not change them but it will\ngive you the option to highlight or\n\n446\n00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:59.040\nat least circle where they went arise.\n\n447\n00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:02.430\nSo really quickly let me come over\nhere to show that if I circle this.\n\n448\n00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:05.900\nIt's not going to do anything\ncuz there's no rules on it.\n\n449\n00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:10.820\nIf I select this column it's\nallowing any value, okay?\n\n450\n00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:17.020\nSo already inputted information,\nwhole number that is greater than 0 and\n\n451\n00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:22.860\nI click OK, and\nnow I do the circle invalid data.\n\n452\n00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.260\nGotta go to the.\n\n453\n00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.480\nHere we go.\n\n454\n00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:31.220\nNow you wanna add circle so it's just\na different way kinda visualizing\n\n455\n00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:34.580\non the page where the problems are.\n\n456\n00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:37.480\nThis could you can do the same thing\nwith conditional formatting, so\n\n457\n00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:40.230\nif you like this sounds kinda\nfamiliar to something else.\n\n458\n00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:42.930\nThat is true, okay?\n\n459\n00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:44.320\n&gt;&gt; Vonne, I do have a quick question.\n\n460\n00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:47.450\nNow we have these circles,\nI saw that we could do a clear.\n\n461\n00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:52.030\nBut what if I change that 2.5 to a 25,\nmaybe I accidentally hit a decimal point.\n\n462\n00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:54.590\nDoes that circle stay there and\nI have to clear it anyway?\n\n463\n00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:56.310\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question,\nlet's find out.\n\n464\n00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.210\nIt clears it for you, yes.\n\n465\n00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:03.190\nSo it will start, so that's kinda\nnice cuz I was like let me fix it.\n\n466\n00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:09.700\nSo if you think about it instead of\nusing it as controlling how it's input\n\n467\n00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:12.880\nyou might use this after the fact,\nto look for\n\n468\n00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:17.710\nerrors okay it's just a different method,\nI need to make sure it's whole numbers,\n\n469\n00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:20.680\nfind me the red circles,\nlet me go back in and change it.\n\n470\n00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:25.160\nOkay so you can still apply data\nvalidation rules after the fact\n\n471\n00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:29.600\non already inputted information, okay?\n\n472\n00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.640\nYou did notice that hey those\ncircles stay on there, so\n\n473\n00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:38.630\nif I come back over to here I don't want\nthose on anymore I can clear the circles.\n\n474\n00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:42.030\nYou can also,\ntalking about this in collaboration,\n\n475\n00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:44.540\nwhat if you got this worksheet\nat this workbook and you said,\n\n476\n00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:47.600\nyou know what,\nI'm gonna take off all those rules.\n\n477\n00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.240\nVonne's just holding me down.\n\n478\n00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:50.650\nI wanna clear them out.\n\n479\n00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:56.680\nSo I come over here as Justin and\nI say, I'm just gonna clear it.\n\n480\n00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:00.950\nAnd I'm going to not make any\nvalidation rules on this and\n\n481\n00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:04.240\nthen I can type in anything I want.\n\n482\n00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:09.570\nThat makes think, if you can take it off\nI don't want you to take it off right?\n\n483\n00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:15.370\nThat's where you might wanna go ahead and\ndo some workbook protection or\n\n484\n00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:21.980\nworksheet protection or security, we talk\nabout this in actually the next episode.\n\n485\n00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:27.490\nSo you might wanna look at that but that's\nsomething you need to look into one,\n\n486\n00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:29.870\nI don't want people to mess this up.\n\n487\n00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:34.290\nAnd maybe like for a dropdown list,\nyou might have one worksheet,\n\n488\n00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:38.180\nlet's just jump down really quick one more\ntime, like this particular worksheet.\n\n489\n00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:40.549\nYou might have this where it\nhas all of your list values.\n\n490\n00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:42.006\nCause you have dropped down list for\n\n491\n00:29:42.006 --> 00:29:44.990\nevery single finger,\nyou are not let anybody type in anything.\n\n492\n00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:47.230\nA only giving you this drop downs.\n\n493\n00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:49.710\nYou might now want people to see this,\nright?\n\n494\n00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:52.370\nCause then they can change it.Yes\nyou can protect the worksheet,\n\n495\n00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:54.190\nyou can also just hide it.\n\n496\n00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:57.680\nI would protect it and\nhide it, do both, okay?\n\n497\n00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:01.310\nAnd so that way people kinda don't see,\nwhere is she getting all these list items,\n\n498\n00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:04.340\nwhere are all these magical drop-downs?\n\n499\n00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:08.170\nProtect it, hide it and\nthat way you don't let\n\n500\n00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:12.220\npeople like Justin over here taking\nall my validation rules off.\n\n501\n00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:15.670\nSo that would be the next step.\n\n502\n00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:19.260\nAlong those same lines\nthat's where you might get\n\n503\n00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:23.790\nerrors if you're trying to clear or\ntry to apply data validation.\n\n504\n00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:26.900\nSomebody might have already\nprevented you from doing that.\n\n505\n00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:32.070\nIn some of the help files that I\nhave links to in the show notes.\n\n506\n00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:35.210\nIt explains some of that, so\ndefinitely check that out and\n\n507\n00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:38.810\nhopefully you're going to go ahead and\nlock down that information and make sure\n\n508\n00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:42.230\nthat you have all sorts of data validation\nrules, so people can't mess things up.\n\n509\n00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:45.030\n&gt;&gt; Well, Van you've definitely worked with\nme before because that would've been my\n\n510\n00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:49.140\nfirst time, be like nah, this is annoying,\ntake all this off, I do what I want to.\n\n511\n00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:50.940\nBut definitely protect it.\n\n512\n00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:53.900\nAnd that value sheet, you know,\nmakes sense for lists but\n\n513\n00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:57.440\nthere were some other thing, you can think\nof that as your configuration sheet,\n\n514\n00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:00.710\nlike if you want to use cell references\nput all of that in that sheet,\n\n515\n00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:05.570\nprotect it, lock it down and then if you\nwant to make a change you can go back and\n\n516\n00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:07.480\nmake that change, but no one else can.\n\n517\n00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:10.370\nSo definitely think about that and well in\norder to figure out how to do that you're\n\n518\n00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:11.850\ngoing to have to come back for\nthe next episode!\n\n519\n00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:13.540\nBut for now, we're gonna go and\nget out of here.\n\n520\n00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:16.090\nSo signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n521\n00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:16.740\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n522\n00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:18.417\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n523\n00:31:18.417 --> 00:31:22.914\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Start moving.\n\n165\n00:07:58.563 --> 00:08:03.520\n&gt;&gt; No, so the structure of this-\n&gt;&gt; Is on lockdown.\n\n166\n00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.960\n&gt;&gt; Correct, I have the workbook protected.\n\n167\n00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:12.776\nWorkbook protection does just that, the\nstructure, it doesn't protect the content.\n\n168\n00:08:12.776 --> 00:08:16.914\nBecause on this one, I could select\nthis and I could change the color.\n\n169\n00:08:16.914 --> 00:08:19.151\nSo that's not locked down, okay.\n\n170\n00:08:19.151 --> 00:08:22.851\nSo workbook structure is one level.\n\n171\n00:08:22.851 --> 00:08:26.141\nThe other level is in here.\n\n172\n00:08:26.141 --> 00:08:31.846\nSo if I come into this worksheet, and\nI click here, I can select these cells.\n\n173\n00:08:31.846 --> 00:08:35.705\nI can even come in here and\nchange this to 5,000.\n\n174\n00:08:35.705 --> 00:08:37.424\nI could change this.\n\n175\n00:08:37.424 --> 00:08:39.730\nOkay, but\nwhat if I want to change the name?\n\n176\n00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:47.224\nLike, it's not Fuego it's supposed\nto be Tulip, we talked about tulips.\n\n177\n00:08:47.224 --> 00:08:49.212\nI couldn't remember it,\nI'm like what are my cat's names?\n\n178\n00:08:49.212 --> 00:08:50.104\nWait, okay.\n\n179\n00:08:50.104 --> 00:08:54.800\nSo you can't see me or\nI cannot click this.\n\n180\n00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.723\nI am clicking and dragging,\nwhy can't I do this?\n\n181\n00:08:57.723 --> 00:08:58.866\nCuz it's locked.\n\n182\n00:08:58.866 --> 00:09:02.169\nOkay, these aren't locked,\nI could go ahead and change this.\n\n183\n00:09:02.169 --> 00:09:04.943\nAnd that's where you should go ahead and\ndo some data validation,\n\n184\n00:09:04.943 --> 00:09:06.761\nto where you can't type in text,\nin a number.\n\n185\n00:09:06.761 --> 00:09:08.408\n&gt;&gt; But eh, that's another\n&gt;&gt; That's security.\n\n186\n00:09:08.408 --> 00:09:11.650\n&gt;&gt; That's a different episode,\nwWe already talked about that.\n\n187\n00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:16.899\nSo I would make sure that would\nonly allow numbers and not text.\n\n188\n00:09:16.899 --> 00:09:19.716\nSo there's different ways\nthat you can lock them, yes,\n\n189\n00:09:19.716 --> 00:09:22.539\nthere's certain ones that I can select and\nmanipulate.\n\n190\n00:09:22.539 --> 00:09:26.397\nVersus hey, this particular worksheet,\nI don't know if I pointed this out,\n\n191\n00:09:26.397 --> 00:09:29.326\nhow do I know that these sheets\nhave worksheet protection?\n\n192\n00:09:29.326 --> 00:09:30.578\nThere you go.\n\n193\n00:09:30.578 --> 00:09:31.429\n&gt;&gt; The little locks.\n\n194\n00:09:31.429 --> 00:09:32.978\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH], so\nI should point that out.\n\n195\n00:09:32.978 --> 00:09:36.875\nNow here I could go ahead and\nselect it, but I can't do anything,\n\n196\n00:09:36.875 --> 00:09:40.378\nwhat you're trying to do is,\nyou're trying to select step and\n\n197\n00:09:40.378 --> 00:09:43.565\nyou can't change it because\nyou gotta enter a password.\n\n198\n00:09:43.565 --> 00:09:46.276\n&gt;&gt; The authorities have\nbeen alerted [LAUGH].\n\n199\n00:09:46.276 --> 00:09:46.804\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n200\n00:09:46.804 --> 00:09:52.276\nRight here, I can select cells back here,\nremember I can't even select it.\n\n201\n00:09:52.276 --> 00:09:55.869\nThere's different levels of what\nyou will allow and not allow.\n\n202\n00:09:55.869 --> 00:09:58.708\nI will allow you to select lop cells but\n\n203\n00:09:58.708 --> 00:10:02.269\nI aint gonna let you do anything with it,\nokay.\n\n204\n00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:06.071\nThis other one was,\nI'm not even gonna give you\n\n205\n00:10:06.071 --> 00:10:10.936\nthe opportunity to select it,\nyou cannot do it, all right?\n\n206\n00:10:10.936 --> 00:10:13.464\nSo these are different perimeters\nthat you can set on them.\n\n207\n00:10:13.464 --> 00:10:17.070\n&gt;&gt; By the way, I really enjoy your body\nlanguage to imply effort of clipping.\n\n208\n00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:19.616\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Come on let's go!\n\n209\n00:10:19.616 --> 00:10:21.172\n&gt;&gt; Yes, come on, I'm doing something!\n\n210\n00:10:21.172 --> 00:10:24.807\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I tend to be a little [CROSSTALK]\n\n211\n00:10:24.807 --> 00:10:25.409\n&gt;&gt; To get this.\n\n212\n00:10:25.409 --> 00:10:29.922\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; She's really digging into it.\n\n213\n00:10:29.922 --> 00:10:32.746\n&gt;&gt; Well they can't see it so.\n\n214\n00:10:32.746 --> 00:10:33.411\n&gt;&gt; I know, I know.\n\n215\n00:10:33.411 --> 00:10:34.875\nYou do what you do, right.\n\n216\n00:10:34.875 --> 00:10:36.197\nYou gotta figure something out.\n\n217\n00:10:36.197 --> 00:10:37.926\n&gt;&gt; I can be a little over animated.\n\n218\n00:10:37.926 --> 00:10:38.554\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n219\n00:10:38.554 --> 00:10:42.990\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so now where do I go to\n&gt;&gt; Take off this protection.\n\n220\n00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:48.720\nIt's in our data, no, it's in Review,\nsorry, in Review, there we are.\n\n221\n00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:56.591\nUnprotect sheet and then this is where you\ndo have to have the name or the password.\n\n222\n00:10:56.591 --> 00:11:01.447\n&gt;&gt; But it is Apple and then I could go\nahead and now I can select these cells and\n\n223\n00:11:01.447 --> 00:11:04.168\ndo things with that, I unprotected it.\n\n224\n00:11:04.168 --> 00:11:08.022\nSame with the workbook protection, notice\nthat this one doesn't say unprotected,\n\n225\n00:11:08.022 --> 00:11:09.692\nit just has that little button on it.\n\n226\n00:11:09.692 --> 00:11:12.165\nSo I would have to click on this.\n\n227\n00:11:12.165 --> 00:11:18.377\nThis one is orange and now so I could get\ninto and then take the protection off\n\n228\n00:11:18.377 --> 00:11:23.817\nI could even take off the password\nnotices in the file passwords.\n\n229\n00:11:23.817 --> 00:11:27.081\nAnd then I could just delete that there.\n\n230\n00:11:27.081 --> 00:11:31.026\nAnd then if I save this, all the\nsecurities and protections would be off.\n\n231\n00:11:31.026 --> 00:11:31.547\nOkay?\n\n232\n00:11:31.547 --> 00:11:32.977\nBut you got to have those passwords.\n\n233\n00:11:32.977 --> 00:11:34.292\nI'm going to cancel this.\n\n234\n00:11:34.292 --> 00:11:35.397\nI'm going to close this.\n\n235\n00:11:35.397 --> 00:11:36.628\nI'm not going to save my changes.\n\n236\n00:11:36.628 --> 00:11:37.838\nI'm doing a command W.\n\n237\n00:11:37.838 --> 00:11:39.502\nAnd then we click there.\n\n238\n00:11:39.502 --> 00:11:41.427\nSo how did I get that?\n\n239\n00:11:41.427 --> 00:11:43.660\nHow did we make these things happen?\n\n240\n00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:48.695\nWell, I was kind of showing you parts of\nit because it's on the review tab for\n\n241\n00:11:48.695 --> 00:11:53.434\nyour worksheet protections and\nworkbook protections, and then the.\n\n242\n00:11:53.434 --> 00:11:57.874\nPassword for the file is in the file menu,\nbut let's talk about this for\n\n243\n00:11:57.874 --> 00:11:58.766\na little bit.\n\n244\n00:11:58.766 --> 00:12:02.519\nLet's talk about this cuz we can't\njust end the episode right there.\n\n245\n00:12:02.519 --> 00:12:03.796\n&gt;&gt; What does Joan Rivers say?\n\n246\n00:12:03.796 --> 00:12:04.494\nCan we talk?\n\n247\n00:12:04.494 --> 00:12:06.048\n&gt;&gt; Can we talk, yeah.\n\n248\n00:12:06.048 --> 00:12:07.602\n[LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n249\n00:12:07.602 --> 00:12:10.285\n[LAUGH] So wasn't that Look Who's Talking?\n\n250\n00:12:10.285 --> 00:12:11.618\nRight at the very end?\n\n251\n00:12:11.618 --> 00:12:12.225\n&gt;&gt; I think so, yeah.\n\n252\n00:12:12.225 --> 00:12:15.207\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, where the baby's like,\ncan we talk?\n\n253\n00:12:15.207 --> 00:12:15.734\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n254\n00:12:15.734 --> 00:12:17.648\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.\nSo, wow, we're showing our age again.\n\n255\n00:12:17.648 --> 00:12:20.109\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to 19, what was that?\n\n256\n00:12:20.109 --> 00:12:21.684\n88 or 89, something like that.\n\n257\n00:12:21.684 --> 00:12:22.846\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was a long time ago.\n\n258\n00:12:22.846 --> 00:12:25.067\nSo [LAUGH].\n\n259\n00:12:25.067 --> 00:12:27.015\nOkay, so protecting our worksheet.\n\n260\n00:12:27.015 --> 00:12:32.189\nThe thing is,\ncells are actually locked by default.\n\n261\n00:12:32.189 --> 00:12:34.647\nYou're like, really, okay.\n\n262\n00:12:34.647 --> 00:12:38.957\nWhen we went into cell formatting\nwe talked a lot about this in\n\n263\n00:12:38.957 --> 00:12:40.739\nthe essentials series.\n\n264\n00:12:40.739 --> 00:12:45.308\nIf I come in to format cells, which is\non the home we can come into our number\n\n265\n00:12:45.308 --> 00:12:49.733\nformats, you could also right click and\nyou can go into format cells And\n\n266\n00:12:49.733 --> 00:12:53.092\nthis dialogue box,\nthat took a little bit to come up.\n\n267\n00:12:53.092 --> 00:12:57.381\nNumber formats, notice we have\nthe accounting, we have alignments,\n\n268\n00:12:57.381 --> 00:13:01.746\nthe fonts, so all of this we have\ntalked about through our other series.\n\n269\n00:13:01.746 --> 00:13:05.698\nWe didn't really touch on this,\nI'm not I mentioned it,\n\n270\n00:13:05.698 --> 00:13:08.391\nand then just let it go,\nnotice right there.\n\n271\n00:13:08.391 --> 00:13:11.161\nIt says that sells our lot.\n\n272\n00:13:11.161 --> 00:13:12.015\nWait.\n\n273\n00:13:12.015 --> 00:13:13.124\nDId I?\n\n274\n00:13:13.124 --> 00:13:13.635\n&gt;&gt; Shenanigans.\n\n275\n00:13:13.635 --> 00:13:15.424\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right?\n\n276\n00:13:15.424 --> 00:13:16.584\nBut then look what it says.\n\n277\n00:13:16.584 --> 00:13:22.567\nIf you want to lock the sales or\nhide from us, you must protect the sheet.\n\n278\n00:13:22.567 --> 00:13:23.128\nOkay.\n\n279\n00:13:23.128 --> 00:13:23.945\nSo that's a weord thing.\n\n280\n00:13:23.945 --> 00:13:26.805\nIt's like all the cells\nare by default log.\n\n281\n00:13:26.805 --> 00:13:31.106\nBut they dont actually Become locked\nunless you protect the worksheet.\n\n282\n00:13:31.106 --> 00:13:33.622\nWhich seems a little strange, but\n\n283\n00:13:33.622 --> 00:13:37.798\nif you think about how many\ncells you have in a worksheet.\n\n284\n00:13:37.798 --> 00:13:40.130\nThere is millions and millions.\n\n285\n00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:43.131\nWe talked about this, you know,\none million-something-something rows and\n\n286\n00:13:43.131 --> 00:13:46.462\nsixty-five thousand, five hundred and\nthirty-six columns.Whoo, that's a lot.\n\n287\n00:13:46.462 --> 00:13:52.209\nSo it's actually easier to go ahead and\nDesignate cells that are not locked.\n\n288\n00:13:52.209 --> 00:13:54.785\nAnd that would be a little bit easier.\n\n289\n00:13:54.785 --> 00:13:59.833\nSo, just keep that in mind, cuz if I went\nin here like, okay well I wanna go ahead,\n\n290\n00:13:59.833 --> 00:14:04.733\ncuz my whole job right now, the reason\nwhy I'm doing this is I don't want people\n\n291\n00:14:04.733 --> 00:14:09.342\nto be able to change the formulas, cuz\nI could come in here and make this like\n\n292\n00:14:09.342 --> 00:14:13.836\nan average or something I could come\nin here and type in Daniel or Caniel.\n\n293\n00:14:13.836 --> 00:14:15.975\nSo like I could change.\n\n294\n00:14:15.975 --> 00:14:16.758\n&gt;&gt; My double ganger.\n\n295\n00:14:16.758 --> 00:14:19.820\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Like I don't want people to mess with\n\n296\n00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:20.838\nany of these cells.\n\n297\n00:14:20.838 --> 00:14:26.498\nThe only thing that a person would\nbe able to do is change these cells.\n\n298\n00:14:26.498 --> 00:14:29.625\nOKay, you can pretend I\nhave that validation on it.\n\n299\n00:14:29.625 --> 00:14:31.131\nIt only accepts numbers too.\n\n300\n00:14:31.131 --> 00:14:36.639\nSo and maybe they can change this, they\ncan change out what week they're in and\n\n301\n00:14:36.639 --> 00:14:39.405\nthey can change out what the sales are.\n\n302\n00:14:39.405 --> 00:14:42.067\nEverything else is completely locked down.\n\n303\n00:14:42.067 --> 00:14:46.898\nSo this is where I would designate and\nI'm going to select my cells and\n\n304\n00:14:46.898 --> 00:14:49.076\nI'm going to format my cells.\n\n305\n00:14:49.076 --> 00:14:52.451\nI'm gonna take the locked Off,\nthese are unlocked,\n\n306\n00:14:52.451 --> 00:14:56.876\nbecause I dont want to when I protect\nthe sheet, have these be locked,\n\n307\n00:14:56.876 --> 00:15:00.719\nbecause I can't do anything,\nok so Im going to unlock them.\n\n308\n00:15:00.719 --> 00:15:05.595\nSo all the rest of the cells are locked,\nthese are not,\n\n309\n00:15:05.595 --> 00:15:08.251\nso when I go over to my review.\n\n310\n00:15:08.251 --> 00:15:12.151\nAnd I go to the protect work sheet,\nnotice all of them are locked, but\n\n311\n00:15:12.151 --> 00:15:15.325\nyou can be formatted as unlocked,\nwe already did that.\n\n312\n00:15:15.325 --> 00:15:17.392\nAnd then we put it,\nwe're gonna go with Apple.\n\n313\n00:15:17.392 --> 00:15:21.318\nWe're going to verify that this is\nApple and let's look down here.\n\n314\n00:15:21.318 --> 00:15:25.449\nThis is where that whole like, do you want\nthem to be able to select anything, or\n\n315\n00:15:25.449 --> 00:15:29.580\ndo you not want them to be able to select\nanything, it's up to you; You probably\n\n316\n00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:33.421\nwanna keep select unlocked,\ncuz otherwise If you can't even select it.\n\n317\n00:15:33.421 --> 00:15:34.022\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n318\n00:15:34.022 --> 00:15:36.068\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't matter if they're\nunlocked or not unlocked, so.\n\n319\n00:15:36.068 --> 00:15:40.526\nMaybe I don't even want to\ngive them the opportunity.\n\n320\n00:15:40.526 --> 00:15:43.708\nI don't want to like hurt their feelings,\nlike why aren't you letting me?\n\n321\n00:15:43.708 --> 00:15:44.435\nI can select it.\n\n322\n00:15:44.435 --> 00:15:46.079\nNo, don't even do that.\n\n323\n00:15:46.079 --> 00:15:46.641\n&gt;&gt; Kind of get their hopes up?\n\n324\n00:15:46.641 --> 00:15:47.496\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n325\n00:15:47.496 --> 00:15:48.771\n&gt;&gt; And then dash them against the rocks.\n\n326\n00:15:48.771 --> 00:15:52.365\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Sorry, I had this visual, just-\n\n327\n00:15:52.365 --> 00:15:53.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n328\n00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:53.895\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n329\n00:15:53.895 --> 00:15:55.887\n&gt;&gt; Okay, wow, where am I today.\n\n330\n00:15:55.887 --> 00:16:00.512\nAnyways, notice if I uncheck this\nwhole select unlocked cells,\n\n331\n00:16:00.512 --> 00:16:05.315\nit takes a lot of other information away,\nor other options, okay.\n\n332\n00:16:05.315 --> 00:16:11.346\nSo I can allow them to format I could\nallow them to sort and filter, I could.\n\n333\n00:16:11.346 --> 00:16:13.640\nFor this example, I'm not going that far.\n\n334\n00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:18.626\nBut just know that you do have other\noptions besides or any other ways\n\n335\n00:16:18.626 --> 00:16:24.340\nthat you can lock down or protect\ndifferent things that they could do.\n\n336\n00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:26.620\nWe're not gonna go that far for\nthis particular example.\n\n337\n00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:29.890\nWe're just gonna say,\nyou can can only select unlocked cells.\n\n338\n00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:34.338\nYou click okay and then if I, see?\n\n339\n00:16:34.338 --> 00:16:35.167\nI'm trying to select it.\n\n340\n00:16:35.167 --> 00:16:35.902\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n341\n00:16:35.902 --> 00:16:36.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It doesn't work.\n\n342\n00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:40.750\nBut I can select these and\nI could go ahead and type in whatever.\n\n343\n00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:46.020\nNotice that once I type in a big number,\nI can't even come up here and select,\n\n344\n00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:50.710\nI can't change the row width or anything?\n\n345\n00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:52.030\nNo, that's the column, these are columns.\n\n346\n00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:54.900\nColumn width because that's all protected.\n\n347\n00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:59.243\nSo different ways that you can\ncontrol what people can and\n\n348\n00:16:59.243 --> 00:17:01.788\ncannot do or even select, okay?\n\n349\n00:17:01.788 --> 00:17:06.050\nAnd that indication that this\nis locked down at the bottom.\n\n350\n00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:09.160\nBut they still could add in worksheets.\n\n351\n00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.439\nThey could rearrange things, right?\n\n352\n00:17:11.439 --> 00:17:15.997\nIf you don't want them to be able to do\nthat, then you're gonna lock down the work\n\n353\n00:17:15.997 --> 00:17:20.560\nbook, okay when you lock down the work\nbook, it maintains the structure.\n\n354\n00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:23.450\nBy the way, these charts are changing\nbecause they're all coming from\n\n355\n00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:24.660\nthese numbers, okay?\n\n356\n00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:29.210\nSo if I change that to 500, notice how\nthe charts will then modify itself.\n\n357\n00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:36.080\nCool, so, protecting the workbook\nintegrity, you go back to here,\n\n358\n00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:40.610\nyou protect the workbook and\nnotice right here, sheets cannot be moved.\n\n359\n00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:42.040\nAll that kind of same stuff.\n\n360\n00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.980\nThat sounds good, I would like that.\n\n361\n00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:46.580\nLet's go with orange.\n\n362\n00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:50.596\nHere, orange there,\nyou verify it, you click OK.\n\n363\n00:17:50.596 --> 00:17:53.097\nThey don't [LAUGH], okay, let's try and\n\n364\n00:17:53.097 --> 00:17:55.677\nsee if I can type in\nthe word twice the same.\n\n365\n00:17:55.677 --> 00:17:56.939\nYay, I passed.\n\n366\n00:17:56.939 --> 00:17:59.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And there you go.\n\n367\n00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.670\nNow, I can't add in any sheets.\n\n368\n00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:05.470\nI'm trying to click this, see I'm\nclicking and it's not doing anything.\n\n369\n00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:07.070\nAnd so that's our worksheet.\n\n370\n00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:09.630\nThen our last one would\nbe our file itself.\n\n371\n00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:13.550\nWe go ahead and put on a password.\n\n372\n00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:19.480\nSo I could give it a password to open or\npassword to modify.\n\n373\n00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.580\nSo why do they have both?\n\n374\n00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:25.260\nYou could go ahead and\ngive somebody a password to open it but\n\n375\n00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:29.320\nthey can't actually change anything\nunless they have the second password.\n\n376\n00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:32.440\nLike the two system verification or\nwhatever.\n\n377\n00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.870\nMicrosoft does this a lot, right?\n\n378\n00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:37.340\nWhere you sign in,\nthen you have to sign in again, right?\n\n379\n00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:38.570\nLove that.\n\n380\n00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:40.402\nIt's okay.\nIt's keeping me safe, or at least.\n\n381\n00:18:40.402 --> 00:18:42.018\n&gt;&gt; That's the purpose of it.\n\n382\n00:18:42.018 --> 00:18:43.994\n&gt;&gt; Or at least the illusion.\n\n383\n00:18:43.994 --> 00:18:45.988\n&gt;&gt; It greatly increases the security.\n\n384\n00:18:45.988 --> 00:18:47.785\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so it's legit.\n\n385\n00:18:47.785 --> 00:18:49.988\nOkay, I trust you.\n\n386\n00:18:49.988 --> 00:18:52.025\nWhich is scary.\n\n387\n00:18:52.025 --> 00:18:54.530\n[LAUGH] No, but you can go ahead and\n\n388\n00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:58.746\ngive them that two layer like okay or\nonly put it on Open.\n\n389\n00:18:58.746 --> 00:19:01.833\nIt's like I'm not even going to\nthe fact that you can open it but\n\n390\n00:19:01.833 --> 00:19:03.220\nyou can't modify it.\n\n391\n00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:06.141\nSo a lot of the stuff that you can\ndo on protecting the worksheets,\n\n392\n00:19:06.141 --> 00:19:07.427\nit's kinda the same thing.\n\n393\n00:19:07.427 --> 00:19:10.782\nBut again, it's two different levels and\nyou could like,\n\n394\n00:19:10.782 --> 00:19:15.090\nokay these people get the password to\nopen but these people get to modify it.\n\n395\n00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:20.895\nIt's up to you what level and\nwhere you want the tiered,\n\n396\n00:19:20.895 --> 00:19:23.559\nif you wanna say, the tiering to go.\n\n397\n00:19:23.559 --> 00:19:26.825\nAnd I will say, Apple for this one.\n\n398\n00:19:26.825 --> 00:19:28.700\nAnd then we click OK.\n\n399\n00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:32.968\nPassword, if you lose the password,\nyou cannot be recovered and there we go,\n\n400\n00:19:32.968 --> 00:19:33.689\nwe click OK.\n\n401\n00:19:33.689 --> 00:19:37.624\nAnd now, if I save this file and\ntry to open it, it would prompt me for\n\n402\n00:19:37.624 --> 00:19:38.534\nthe password.\n\n403\n00:19:38.534 --> 00:19:43.295\nI'm not going to do that because\nI want you to give you guys this\n\n404\n00:19:43.295 --> 00:19:48.650\nparticular file and allow you to\nfollow along and do the same things.\n\n405\n00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:53.601\nSo that would cover all the things\nthat you could do in Mac.\n\n406\n00:19:53.601 --> 00:19:57.760\nI did wanna point out that in the file,\nthere is this Restrict Permissions.\n\n407\n00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:02.354\nAnd this is where people like, it won't\nlet me do any restrictions cuz I think\n\n408\n00:20:02.354 --> 00:20:04.900\nthat is the like\nprotecting the workbook or\n\n409\n00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:08.384\nprotecting the work here or\neven password protecting it.\n\n410\n00:20:08.384 --> 00:20:11.240\nIt's not the same thing.\n\n411\n00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:16.167\nThis is where, I can understand\nwhere people are coming from\n\n412\n00:20:16.167 --> 00:20:21.189\nbecause in Excel for PC,\nthere is in word and also in Excel like\n\n413\n00:20:21.189 --> 00:20:26.235\nthis whole your restricting who\ncan do what in certain areas.\n\n414\n00:20:26.235 --> 00:20:30.772\nLike you're only locking down parts of\nit then other parts are not locked.\n\n415\n00:20:30.772 --> 00:20:35.812\nLike you were saying, I'm giving\nout rights of who can do what, so\n\n416\n00:20:35.812 --> 00:20:41.490\nI can understand why they say,\nrestrict, it's used in the PC world.\n\n417\n00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:43.290\nBut it's not.\n\n418\n00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:46.683\nCuz even if you go to it,\nif you go here and say restrict access,\n\n419\n00:20:46.683 --> 00:20:50.848\nit actually come in to say like you have\nto contact your systems administrator\n\n420\n00:20:50.848 --> 00:20:53.720\n[LAUGH] because we just\nabout we were talking about.\n\n421\n00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:59.103\nThis is that IRM, that whole rights\nmanagement act that network level,\n\n422\n00:20:59.103 --> 00:21:02.027\nor your systems administrator level.\n\n423\n00:21:02.027 --> 00:21:03.231\n&gt;&gt; So something you can do.\n\n424\n00:21:03.231 --> 00:21:07.318\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's one of those and\nthen they call the help desk,\n\n425\n00:21:07.318 --> 00:21:09.594\nI can't password protect my file.\n\n426\n00:21:09.594 --> 00:21:11.354\n&gt;&gt; And then they go,\nsorry about your look, clang.\n\n427\n00:21:11.354 --> 00:21:13.203\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n428\n00:21:13.203 --> 00:21:15.729\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n\n429\n00:21:15.729 --> 00:21:17.607\nNo, I only deal with things on network.\n\n430\n00:21:17.607 --> 00:21:18.951\nSo those are some different things.\n\n431\n00:21:18.951 --> 00:21:23.283\nSo anyways, I do have in the show notes,\nvery PC specific things and\n\n432\n00:21:23.283 --> 00:21:26.931\nthere's some links to stuff\nlike digital signatures and\n\n433\n00:21:26.931 --> 00:21:31.500\nthe restrict access, you can't do\nit anyways here, so, it's okay.\n\n434\n00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:36.240\nBut anyways, if you want to add\na little bit of protection right there,\n\n435\n00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.558\npretty cool about locking\ndown your work sheets,\n\n436\n00:21:39.558 --> 00:21:42.560\nremember to format\nthe cells to be unlocked.\n\n437\n00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:46.588\nIf you want people to be able to modify\nit, protect your workbook is the structure\n\n438\n00:21:46.588 --> 00:21:49.460\nnot the content and\nthen password protecting it.\n\n439\n00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:52.918\nWell, that's where you have\nto had a password open it and\n\n440\n00:21:52.918 --> 00:21:55.019\nthat is work of security in Excel.\n\n441\n00:21:55.019 --> 00:21:58.586\n&gt;&gt; Well Vonne, it is nice to know there\nare some security options for us,\n\n442\n00:21:58.586 --> 00:22:01.920\nwe're not left without any recourse and\nwhen those needs arise.\n\n443\n00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.240\nAnd when they do it now you\ncan put a password on or\n\n444\n00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:08.068\ndo any of the myriad of other things that\nVonne choose that we could do to get them\n\n445\n00:22:08.068 --> 00:22:11.040\nat least a little bit of lock\ndown in some shape or form.\n\n446\n00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:11.930\nSo Vonne, thanks for driving by.\n\n447\n00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:14.735\nThanks for showing us how to do\nworkbook security and thank you for\n\n448\n00:22:14.735 --> 00:22:15.610\njoining us as well.\n\n449\n00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:18.189\nBut it is that time for us to call it day.\n\n450\n00:22:18.189 --> 00:22:21.043\nSigning off for Office ProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n451\n00:22:21.043 --> 00:22:21.922\n&gt;&gt;

to another great\nepisode of OfficePro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.423\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin this episode we are back with more,\n\n5\n00:00:19.423 --> 00:00:22.046\nin our Excel 2016 Advanced series for Mac.\n\n6\n00:00:22.046 --> 00:00:26.420\nJoining us back in the studio, the Mac\nwizard herself, the one Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.400\nVonne, we're glad to have you yet\nagain, how's it going?\n\n8\n00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.620\n&gt;&gt; I wanna cast a spell on you, yeah.\n\n9\n00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.596\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nI wanna get you

00:00:36.177\n&gt;&gt; My gosh.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so cool,\n\n13\n00:00:36.177 --> 00:00:37.382\nall velvet and\n&gt;&gt; Somehow,\n\n14\n00:00:37.382 --> 00:00:39.920\nI started thinking about\nthe Lucky Charms commercial.\n\n15\n00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.170\nPink hearts, yellow moons\n&gt;&gt; Green clovers.\n\n16\n00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.640\n&gt;&gt; Purple\n&gt;&gt;

--> 00:00:49.546\nWe're not talking about cereal.\n\n20\n00:00:49.546 --> 00:00:52.279\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now that everybody is craving\n\n21\n00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.870\nLucky Charms.\n\n22\n00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.740\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We are talking about document\n\n23\n00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:57.610\nproperties.\n\n24\n00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.920\nYes, if you're like we've seen this so\nmany times.\n\n25\n00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.310\nI know because every single product has,\ndocument properties.\n\n26\n00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.290\nYes and if you're like you said\nthis in the PC version show.\n\n27\n00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.494\nI did, yes cuz exactly.\n\n28\n00:01:12.494 --> 00:01:15.193\nThe document properties\nokay even if you haven't\n\n29\n00:01:15.193 --> 00:01:19.170\nwatched any of these shows cuz\nyou're like well I've never seen it.\n\n30\n00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.018\nThat's why I include it in every single\nseries of every product because,\n\n31\n00:01:24.018 --> 00:01:26.129\nit is important to understand,\n\n32\n00:01:26.129 --> 00:01:31.153\nthat there's more information to your\nfiles than just what you put in them.\n\n33\n00:01:31.153 --> 00:01:36.864\nThe information that's in your cells\nin Excel, there's metadata or,\n\n34\n00:01:36.864 --> 00:01:41.276\nhidden if you wanna say,\ninformation about your file.\n\n35\n00:01:41.276 --> 00:01:47.056\nThat is below the surface, that you\nactually do have some control over,\n\n36\n00:01:47.056 --> 00:01:50.940\nand you can use it to\neither do certain searches,\n\n37\n00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.868\nor just add keywords,\nadd extra information into that file,\n\n38\n00:01:55.868 --> 00:02:00.210\nthat you can use for\nwhatever purpose that might be.\n\n39\n00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.600\nSo, there is some people that are well\nthat, well doesn't do me any good at all,\n\n40\n00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.440\nbut it all depends on like what sector you\nwork in, where at maybe you need to put\n\n41\n00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.600\nthat extra information into the file\nbecause it's like you can't put in\n\n42\n00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.410\nthat stuff in the cells of a file but,\nif you include it into\n\n43\n00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.230\nthe notes of the actual document,\nit could be really helpful, so.\n\n44\n00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.140\nYou know a lot about document properties\nor at least hidden metadata, right?\n\n45\n00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n46\n00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.384\nso\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes you gotta look for it,\n\n47\n00:02:29.384 --> 00:02:31.783\nscrub through, try to find out\nwho actually created the thing so\n\n48\n00:02:31.783 --> 00:02:33.843\nyou can extrapolate a user name and\npassword out of it.\n\n49\n00:02:33.843 --> 00:02:38.158\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We just talked hacking\npasswords and document security.\n\n50\n00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:39.543\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But yeah,\n\n51\n00:02:39.543 --> 00:02:43.496\nthere's\n&gt;&gt; There's so much underneath the surface\n\n52\n00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:49.347\nto your files, and this does get into\nthe kinda I don't want to say dark.\n\n53\n00:02:49.347 --> 00:02:50.600\n&gt;&gt; Like hidden info.\n&gt;&gt; No because, for\n\n54\n00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.577\nus we're like,\nI operate on the surface for most of it.\n\n55\n00:02:53.577 --> 00:02:55.073\nI mean I only know-\n&gt;&gt; Jet Skiis yes.\n\n56\n00:02:55.073 --> 00:02:56.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n57\n00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.600\nthere's a whole ocean underneath you.\n\n58\n00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.300\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and this gets into the\nhackiness, or the techie part of it and\n\n59\n00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.600\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n60\n00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.550\nSo just know, we're gonna keep it up here.\n\n61\n00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.250\nBut it is things that you\ncan add into your document.\n\n62\n00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.080\nI know one area of like so talk about what\nsector you work in, or what have you.\n\n63\n00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.780\nLawyers, and I know from people that I've\ntalked with years said, yeah, we add all\n\n64\n00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.750\nof this information to our files because,\nIf you're working on certain cases, or\n\n65\n00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.790\nwhat have you, there might be information,\nbut you wanna put little notes in to it.\n\n66\n00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.850\nSo they put it into,\nthe document properties and\n\n67\n00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.570\nthey use that to catalog the information.\n\n68\n00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.090\nBecause this information can be\nused to search for your files.\n\n69\n00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.610\nEven though, for example,\nlet's just jump onto here.\n\n70\n00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.710\nI have a list of files, and\nI have a file called Document Properties.\n\n71\n00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.640\nThat's the name of the file.\n\n72\n00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.950\nSure, I could go ahead and search for,\nlike, properties, and I can\n\n73\n00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.800\nsee where it has, like on this particular\nfolder, you can see where my, yeah.\n\n74\n00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.926\nIt's bringing up the name of\nthe file in this particular folder.\n\n75\n00:04:07.926 --> 00:04:09.910\nBecause that's what we've got, right?\n\n76\n00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.150\nBut what if I put in the word inspect,\nokay?\n\n77\n00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.811\nActually here, let's do this first,\nlet's clear this out, okay.\n\n78\n00:04:16.811 --> 00:04:20.480\nAnd now, let's go to inspect.\n\n79\n00:04:21.745 --> 00:04:23.535\nAnd then I click on this.\n\n80\n00:04:23.535 --> 00:04:24.795\nIt still brought up that file.\n\n81\n00:04:26.915 --> 00:04:27.985\nWhy did it do that, Daniel?\n\n82\n00:04:27.985 --> 00:04:30.712\n&gt;&gt; Probably because of the meta\ndata that's involved with it.\n\n83\n00:04:30.712 --> 00:04:31.846\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n84\n00:04:31.846 --> 00:04:35.065\n&gt;&gt; So you can see that our computers,\n\n85\n00:04:35.065 --> 00:04:37.675\nare smart enough, to search for\n\n86\n00:04:37.675 --> 00:04:43.385\nother things besides just the file name,\nbecause yes, you are correct.\n\n87\n00:04:43.385 --> 00:04:45.160\nThere is a tag.\n\n88\n00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.230\nThat I put into this meta data,\nthe tag is the actual field name.\n\n89\n00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.270\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n90\n00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.260\n&gt;&gt; And I went ahead and\nput in, inspect, okay cool.\n\n91\n00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.284\nSo if you think about from a lawyer's\nperspective or what have you,\n\n92\n00:04:57.284 --> 00:05:00.838\nthey could use that metadata to organize,\ncuz, maybe they needed the file to be\n\n93\n00:05:00.838 --> 00:05:03.941\ncalled Document Properties,\nwhen they couldn't call it Inspect.\n\n94\n00:05:03.941 --> 00:05:08.950\nAnd so all those different ways\nthat you can do that kind of stuff.\n\n95\n00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.282\nNow some of it is user\ninputted properties.\n\n96\n00:05:13.282 --> 00:05:16.999\nSome of it comes with just the file\n&gt;&gt; The creation of a file.\n\n97\n00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:19.304\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\njust the existence of the file by itself.\n\n98\n00:05:19.304 --> 00:05:19.921\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n99\n00:05:19.921 --> 00:05:23.392\n&gt;&gt; So let's look at it, I will-\n&gt;&gt; The essence de file.\n\n100\n00:05:23.392 --> 00:05:28.505\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Essence de file.\n\n101\n00:05:28.505 --> 00:05:29.551\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n102\n00:05:29.551 --> 00:05:30.478\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Sounds.\n\n103\n00:05:30.478 --> 00:05:32.294\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, from Calvin Klein.\n\n104\n00:05:32.294 --> 00:05:35.592\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We're sorry.\n\n105\n00:05:35.592 --> 00:05:36.608\n&gt;&gt; We have problems.\n\n106\n00:05:36.608 --> 00:05:39.172\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We do.\n\n107\n00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:39.809\nOkay.\nSo\n\n108\n00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:44.902\nlet's come back into this particular file,\nsame information we've seen a lot.\n\n109\n00:05:44.902 --> 00:05:46.772\nSame everything.\n\n110\n00:05:46.772 --> 00:05:51.200\nI put in some specific information\nin here, that is going to\n\n111\n00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.880\nlead itself into the other topic within\nthis episode which is accessibility.\n\n112\n00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.060\nWhich is actually something\nvery important, but\n\n113\n00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.920\nwe're still talking about\ndocument properties.\n\n114\n00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.290\nWhere do we find them?\n\n115\n00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:08.180\nIn the Mac world, it's in your file menu,\nand it's down here in properties.\n\n116\n00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.500\nOkay.\nIn the PC world you have like\n\n117\n00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.460\nthe backstage view, that whole other area\nthat you could see it off to the right.\n\n118\n00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.054\nSo if you're like, where do I find it?\n\n119\n00:06:15.054 --> 00:06:17.110\nFile properties.\n\n120\n00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.840\nThat's what we're looking at.\n\n121\n00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.240\nAll right, so here we go.\nWe have our general.\n\n122\n00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:26.050\nAnd you can see that there's some pretty\ncool information like, where does it live?\n\n123\n00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:27.180\nOkay.\nIt's on my desktop.\n\n124\n00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.460\nWhen was it created?\n\n125\n00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.460\nWow this was created a while ago.\n\n126\n00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.970\nWhen was the last time I modified it?\n\n127\n00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.319\n&gt;&gt; Been a minute.\nAlmost a year ago.\n\n128\n00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:39.660\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n129\n00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:44.481\nBut that's the cool thing if someone\ncame in and modified something,\n\n130\n00:06:44.481 --> 00:06:47.679\nlike let's go ahead and\nchange this to Tampa.\n\n131\n00:06:47.679 --> 00:06:52.210\nAnd then I scroll out, and\nthen I save this, and I close it,\n\n132\n00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.965\nhopefully, if it works properly.\n\n133\n00:06:54.965 --> 00:06:57.939\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If I come in to my properties then,\n\n134\n00:06:57.939 --> 00:07:02.775\nyep, thank you, and right there you\ncan see that this is today's date And\n\n135\n00:07:02.775 --> 00:07:06.690\nnow I can see when it was created,\nand when it was modified.\n\n136\n00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:12.140\nThis is one of those things I talk to\npeople about where, you tell the teacher,\n\n137\n00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.880\nI have the file but my computer crashed or\nwhat have you or something like that.\n\n138\n00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.760\nAnd it's like no, it was due on Friday.\n\n139\n00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.400\nYou started it.\n\n140\n00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.510\n&gt;&gt; You created it like 12 hours ago.\n\n141\n00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:26.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean that you\ncan see that kind of stuff.\n\n142\n00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:32.070\nSo, be a little careful about that,\ntrying to use that excuse.\n\n143\n00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:34.390\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah,\ncuz I had to recreate it from memory.\n\n144\n00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.240\nIt was completely gone.\n\n145\n00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.060\nYou just be glad you got this.\n\n146\n00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:38.848\n&gt;&gt; Right?\nThat's a good way to.\n\n147\n00:07:38.848 --> 00:07:39.536\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm good.\n\n148\n00:07:39.536 --> 00:07:41.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I do not doubt that.\n\n149\n00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:45.510\n&gt;&gt; Now, and then you have some\nother things with the summary.\n\n150\n00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:50.110\nNow, there are things that I put in,\nlike right here, keywords.\n\n151\n00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:50.965\nInspect.\n\n152\n00:07:50.965 --> 00:07:55.083\nThat's why I could use it in my\nfile search, cuz it's searching for\n\n153\n00:07:55.083 --> 00:07:59.995\nmore than just like the top layer, it's\ngoing into that Bottom layer or into that\n\n154\n00:07:59.995 --> 00:08:04.930\nocean that we're talking about, and I can\nadd in things like who is the manager?\n\n155\n00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:08.206\nWhat is the subject of\nthis particular document?\n\n156\n00:08:08.206 --> 00:08:12.737\nNote that in the title of the document,\nsome comments in here,\n\n157\n00:08:12.737 --> 00:08:16.070\nthere's all sorts of\nthings that you can add as\n\n158\n00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:19.848\nlittle behind the scenes\nnotes to any of your files.\n\n159\n00:08:19.848 --> 00:08:21.910\nYou also have some statistics.\n\n160\n00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:25.480\nSo okay, you can say that, though,\nagain, the created, when it was printed,\n\n161\n00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:30.470\nlast saved by, cuz I'm logged in,\nand as OfficePro TV.\n\n162\n00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:34.643\nAnother thing I think is kind of neat is,\nwhat's in this document?\n\n163\n00:08:34.643 --> 00:08:36.040\nWhat's the contents.\n\n164\n00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.340\nThat's kind of cool, it has a pivot table.\n\n165\n00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.050\nThere's a hidden something.\n\n166\n00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:42.630\nThere's an image.\n\n167\n00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:44.350\nThere's some named ranges.\n\n168\n00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:51.120\nSo, this kind of just gives you an overall\nview of the contents of your file.\n\n169\n00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.730\nThat can be kind of interesting.\n\n170\n00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:55.740\nEspecially if like,\nthere's something that's hidden?\n\n171\n00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.270\nReally?\nWhere is that?\n\n172\n00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.430\nBecause sometimes you can hide worksheets.\n\n173\n00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:00.255\n&gt;&gt; People love hidden stuff.\n\n174\n00:09:00.255 --> 00:09:03.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right?\nAnd sometimes it's not very apparent.\n\n175\n00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.688\nIf you're not really looking for,\nespecially with worksheets,\n\n176\n00:09:06.688 --> 00:09:10.282\nyou can hide worksheets,\nwithout there any like real indication.\n\n177\n00:09:10.282 --> 00:09:12.465\nThat there is hidden worksheets.\n\n178\n00:09:12.465 --> 00:09:14.782\nCuz that's kind of cool\nto come handy here.\n\n179\n00:09:14.782 --> 00:09:17.370\nAnd then you can create\nyour own custom tags.\n\n180\n00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:18.130\nYeah, I remember.\n\n181\n00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:20.130\nLook.\nI added you.\n\n182\n00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:20.846\n&gt;&gt; There I am.\n\n183\n00:09:20.846 --> 00:09:23.420\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it was checked by Daniel.\n\n184\n00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:24.410\nOkay, perfect.\n\n185\n00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:26.075\n&gt;&gt; I don't remember doing that your honor.\n\n186\n00:09:26.075 --> 00:09:28.550\n[LAUGH] I have no recollection of that.\n\n187\n00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:29.660\n&gt;&gt; But it's documented.\n\n188\n00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:30.410\nIt's in here.\n\n189\n00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:32.520\nYou can't fight that so.\n\n190\n00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.114\nAlways document everything.\n\n191\n00:09:34.114 --> 00:09:37.979\nAnyways, you can see you've got the dip.\n\n192\n00:09:37.979 --> 00:09:39.152\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Diptheria.\n\n193\n00:09:39.152 --> 00:09:42.702\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Disposition\n&gt;&gt; That word.\n\n194\n00:09:42.702 --> 00:09:46.050\n[LAUGH] Me and pronunciation.\n\n195\n00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:49.516\nClient, department,\ndestination, deposition, right?\n\n196\n00:09:49.516 --> 00:09:52.080\nIt's cuz that's how you spell it.\n\n197\n00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:52.650\n&gt;&gt; Disposition.\n\n198\n00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:54.820\n&gt;&gt; Dispotation, okay.\n\n199\n00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:55.475\n&gt;&gt; Not deposition.\n\n200\n00:09:55.475 --> 00:09:58.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, words.\n\n201\n00:09:58.510 --> 00:09:59.780\nAnd you can see,\n\n202\n00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:05.140\nyou can add the mail stop as the name of\nyour particular tag, that you want to do.\n\n203\n00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:07.940\nOr you can make your own,\nyou can have a value.\n\n204\n00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:13.340\nSo again, all these Metadata,\nextra information that you could save\n\n205\n00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:19.650\ninto this file, for whatever purposes\nthat you might or may not need it.\n\n206\n00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.790\nYou could also do this to where you can\n\n207\n00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:27.496\ncreate all these document\nproperties in a blank notebook.\n\n208\n00:10:27.496 --> 00:10:28.387\nNotebook?\n\n209\n00:10:28.387 --> 00:10:29.278\nWorkbook.\n\n210\n00:10:29.278 --> 00:10:31.230\n[LAUGH] Wrong product.\n\n211\n00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.036\nWe're not doing One Note right now.\n\n212\n00:10:33.036 --> 00:10:36.900\nAnd then you add all this stuff in,\nand you save it as a template.\n\n213\n00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:41.420\nI've heard of different lawyers,\nwhere if they're\n\n214\n00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:44.310\nusing a whole bunch of stuff on one case,\nthey'll make a template because they don't\n\n215\n00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:48.270\nwant to add in all of this extra stuff\nevery, single time they make a new file.\n\n216\n00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:50.660\nSo they'll just go ahead and\ncreate something.\n\n217\n00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:53.950\nCreate a blank, put in all their metadata,\n\n218\n00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:56.760\nsave that as the template cuz\nit's still part of the file.\n\n219\n00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.945\nAnd then you file new from template,\nrather than just file new.\n\n220\n00:10:59.945 --> 00:11:02.550\nSo it, keeps everything in there.\n\n221\n00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:05.838\nJust different examples of why and\nhow you might want to use this.\n\n222\n00:11:05.838 --> 00:11:10.053\nAnd that's what you've got\nwith your doc properties.\n\n223\n00:11:10.053 --> 00:11:14.613\nNow, there is something\nin your preferences,\n\n224\n00:11:14.613 --> 00:11:21.690\nif you go into Excel preferences, and\ngo into your security and privacy.\n\n225\n00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:23.530\nYou see right here where it says,\n\n226\n00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:26.730\nremove personal information\nfrom this file on save?\n\n227\n00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:30.488\nYou're thinking, well that's gonna\nget rid of all your metadata.\n\n228\n00:11:30.488 --> 00:11:32.150\nIt doesn't actually do all that.\n\n229\n00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:36.050\nIt's only gonna get rid of like the name\nthat you might have on this file.\n\n230\n00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:41.220\nLike if it's saying Justin Timberlake,\nas the owner or the person logged in.\n\n231\n00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.790\nIt could, get that information out.\n\n232\n00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:49.331\nBut I don't want you to rely on this if\nlike it's gonna take out the metadata or,\n\n233\n00:11:49.331 --> 00:11:51.828\ndocument properties of your file.\n\n234\n00:11:51.828 --> 00:11:56.730\nIt doesn't work like that, it's not I'd\neven tried this from like okay you go\n\n235\n00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:00.617\nback in, and then it still has\nall your document properties.\n\n236\n00:12:00.617 --> 00:12:04.418\nThe like scrubbing of all of\nyour document information or\n\n237\n00:12:04.418 --> 00:12:07.593\ndocument properties that's something that.\n\n238\n00:12:07.593 --> 00:12:09.450\nYou do have that at the PC level.\n\n239\n00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:13.990\nThere is something known as inspect\ndocument, to where it will list and\n\n240\n00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:18.110\ninspect everything else and say,\nhey, you've got, metadata in here.\n\n241\n00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:21.080\nAnd there's a button over there that says,\nremove all and you could-\n\n242\n00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.760\n&gt;&gt; And it actually does that.\n\n243\n00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.505\n&gt;&gt; Well, the button says it removes all.\n\n244\n00:12:24.505 --> 00:12:25.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Does it really?\n\n245\n00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.470\nIt's kind of-\n&gt;&gt; Can you trust it?\n\n246\n00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:29.011\n&gt;&gt; You can delete your hard drive, right?\n\n247\n00:12:29.011 --> 00:12:30.664\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you can.\n&gt;&gt; But the information still on there,\n\n248\n00:12:30.664 --> 00:12:31.190\nisn't there?\n\n249\n00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.690\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n250\n00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:38.020\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so I'm curious to know\nif that's really the case,\n\n251\n00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:42.060\nespecially talking with you all,\nyou guys, it's.\n\n252\n00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.060\nYeah, you can do it but\nit's never really gone.\n\n253\n00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:45.850\nDont ever trust all of these stuff.\n\n254\n00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:46.870\nI'm like okay.\n\n255\n00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:48.800\nI'm sorry.\nSo, is it really going?\n\n256\n00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.390\nI dont know.\n\n257\n00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:53.340\nBut, the button tells me this.\n\n258\n00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:54.860\nYou're just sitting there.\n\n259\n00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:56.428\nYou're.\n&gt;&gt; You getting like,\n\n260\n00:12:56.428 --> 00:12:58.368\nyou can make things gone.\n\n261\n00:12:58.368 --> 00:12:59.930\nBut it takes effort.\n\n262\n00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:03.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's not typically a click remove all.\n\n263\n00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:04.910\nAnd it does that.\n\n264\n00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:07.343\nIt's basically just doing a very simple,\n\n265\n00:13:07.343 --> 00:13:11.411\nthese things are now not gonna show\nup if someone looks at this, right?\n\n266\n00:13:11.411 --> 00:13:14.429\nIf you start really inspecting\nit using third-party tools\n\n267\n00:13:14.429 --> 00:13:18.481\nthat are meant to do deep inspection,\nyou're probably still having trouble.\n\n268\n00:13:18.481 --> 00:13:19.880\nIt still might show up.\n\n269\n00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.684\nOlder versions of\nthe file get hung around,\n\n270\n00:13:21.684 --> 00:13:23.846\nespecially with these new\njournaled file systems.\n\n271\n00:13:23.846 --> 00:13:28.656\nThere might be something lingering there,\nbut, typically with these type of things,\n\n272\n00:13:28.656 --> 00:13:30.930\nyou click a button, it removes it.\n\n273\n00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:32.020\nYou look and inspect it.\n\n274\n00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.330\nIt's gone, it's not there anymore.\n\n275\n00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:36.536\nSo the average passerby trying to look for\nthat information, it won't show up.\n\n276\n00:13:36.536 --> 00:13:39.760\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\nthe level that we as in office need to be.\n\n277\n00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.992\n&gt;&gt; Remember, jet skis.\n\n278\n00:13:40.992 --> 00:13:41.950\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly,\n\n279\n00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:45.510\nwe're just going along, we're good.\n\n280\n00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:46.920\n&gt;&gt; Zipping across the surface.\n\n281\n00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, so don't go back and\n\n282\n00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:53.648\nsay, the girl on OfficePro TV\nsaid it's really still there.\n\n283\n00:13:53.648 --> 00:13:56.690\nI can't 100% verify any of that, really.\n\n284\n00:13:56.690 --> 00:14:00.180\nBut, in the PC world I do know there\nis an inspect, there is a button, and\n\n285\n00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:01.450\nit should remove everything.\n\n286\n00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:05.590\nAnd it does, like you're saying,\nat that surface level, take it all away.\n\n287\n00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:08.410\nYou don't have an inspect document in Mac.\n\n288\n00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:12.390\nSo if you're looking for it,\nthere is no inspect document.\n\n289\n00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:17.410\nGive me this cool summary about what's\ngoing on in my file, including,\n\n290\n00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:19.645\ndo you have Metadata in there, okay?\n\n291\n00:14:19.645 --> 00:14:23.375\nIt's not just part of the office for\nMac Art.\n\n292\n00:14:24.525 --> 00:14:27.935\nSo, anyways, you could go in and\ndelete this.\n\n293\n00:14:27.935 --> 00:14:32.555\nYou can manually go through and take this\nstuff out of the summary, and I don't\n\n294\n00:14:32.555 --> 00:14:37.960\nwant the author or the company or any of\nthose things to be included, into my file.\n\n295\n00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.590\nBut it's a much more manual process, okay.\n\n296\n00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:45.253\nAnd I also read some articles where,\nthey had in schools where they have\n\n297\n00:14:45.253 --> 00:14:50.238\na different document verification to\nsee whether you're cheating or not.\n\n298\n00:14:50.238 --> 00:14:54.426\nAnd where you could try to get rid\nof some of that information but\n\n299\n00:14:54.426 --> 00:14:59.250\nbecause of that metadata,\nyou can't fully try to cheat the system.\n\n300\n00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:03.330\nLike you gotta, but like you said, if\nyou know the tricks, I'm sure you could.\n\n301\n00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:06.312\n[LAUGH] It depends on\nhow deep you wanna go.\n\n302\n00:15:06.312 --> 00:15:09.238\n&gt;&gt; It's all a game of who's\ngot the better bag of tricks.\n\n303\n00:15:09.238 --> 00:15:11.180\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yes, definitely.\n\n304\n00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:12.099\nWho has the better tools?\n\n305\n00:15:12.099 --> 00:15:15.326\nYeah, who has the magic spells and\nthe right ones, the portions and\n\n306\n00:15:15.326 --> 00:15:16.265\nall the fun stuff?\n\n307\n00:15:16.265 --> 00:15:17.647\n[LAUGH] Okay.\n\n308\n00:15:17.647 --> 00:15:22.074\nSo now let's go over to accessibility.\n\n309\n00:15:22.074 --> 00:15:26.977\nOkay, now, this isn't necessarily document\nproperties, but I always like to kind\n\n310\n00:15:26.977 --> 00:15:30.655\nof put this all together because\nit's just those extra things,\n\n311\n00:15:30.655 --> 00:15:35.033\nthat you need to know that kind of hiding\nbehind the surface of information.\n\n312\n00:15:35.033 --> 00:15:39.108\nAnd accessibility is actually\npretty important because,\n\n313\n00:15:39.108 --> 00:15:43.996\nif I have non sided individuals,\nthat's looking at this particular,\n\n314\n00:15:43.996 --> 00:15:49.550\nwell they're not seeing it, but I need to\nbe able to speak to them, what is this?\n\n315\n00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:52.900\nThis is something known as alternate text,\nwith images.\n\n316\n00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:58.224\nWe do talk about this, in this particular\nshow, in this series, or in the images.\n\n317\n00:15:58.224 --> 00:16:02.020\nSo definitely go back and\ncheck that out But\n\n318\n00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:07.610\nthe accessibility checker's\ngoing to do just that, check for\n\n319\n00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:13.095\nthings that need to be included\nif you want to be accessible for\n\n320\n00:16:13.095 --> 00:16:15.680\nall different people.\n\n321\n00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:20.016\nSo if we go into the tools, and\nwe go to check accessibility,\n\n322\n00:16:20.016 --> 00:16:24.105\nit's going through and\ninspecting my entire document.\n\n323\n00:16:24.105 --> 00:16:27.852\nThe cool thing about this is if you\nclick on, okay, here are my errors,\n\n324\n00:16:27.852 --> 00:16:31.723\nhere I have some missing alternative text,\nand I knew that, and it's for\n\n325\n00:16:31.723 --> 00:16:33.170\nthis particular picture.\n\n326\n00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:38.020\nBut then it has some other things\nin here for, merged cells?\n\n327\n00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:42.415\nAnd if you can click on it, the neat thing\nis one, it jumps you directly to the place\n\n328\n00:16:42.415 --> 00:16:45.752\nin your file or workbook where it exists,\nand highlights it.\n\n329\n00:16:45.752 --> 00:16:46.830\nThat's kinda cool.\n\n330\n00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:49.230\nAnd actually,\nbehind my head down here at the bottom,\n\n331\n00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:52.920\nyou can see it's actually\ngot some information of why,\n\n332\n00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:57.870\nit's explaining to you what you're doing\nhere, or why it needs to be fixed.\n\n333\n00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:02.850\nAnd then you can say that, okay,\nso screen readers have a hard\n\n334\n00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:07.700\ntime understanding and\ntranslating a merged cell.\n\n335\n00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.520\nSo it could skip things,\n\n336\n00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:14.250\nand that's something that like,\nokay, I never knew that.\n\n337\n00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:16.970\nWell, I did know that, but\nmaybe you are saying that.\n\n338\n00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:21.710\nAnd then it says, let me go ahead and just\ntake this off and just take off the merge.\n\n339\n00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:29.330\nOkay, and if I had clicked on, say,\nthe picture, or error for the picture.\n\n340\n00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:32.110\nWhy alternate text is important for\nscreen narrators.\n\n341\n00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:37.240\nThen it actually tells you right here\ndown at the bottom where you can\n\n342\n00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:42.560\nadd alternate text to your images by\ngoing to the format pane and going to\n\n343\n00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:46.450\nthe layout properties, and then clicking\nand entering a title and description.\n\n344\n00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:51.830\nOkay, so that's pretty neat\nthat they just try to help you\n\n345\n00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:55.270\nunderstand why, and then how to fix.\n\n346\n00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:57.190\nI think that's a really cool part that\n\n347\n00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:01.711\nMicrosoft Office has done\nacross all of the products.\n\n348\n00:18:01.711 --> 00:18:04.721\nIt's just nice they gave\nyou that understanding,\n\n349\n00:18:04.721 --> 00:18:08.221\nthat perspective of this is\nsomething that is important for\n\n350\n00:18:08.221 --> 00:18:13.057\npeople that do rely on screen readers to\nbe able to speak this information to them.\n\n351\n00:18:13.057 --> 00:18:15.189\nSo good thing to know about.\n\n352\n00:18:15.189 --> 00:18:19.657\nAnd then just follow the links and\nthen go ahead and fix the changes.\n\n353\n00:18:19.657 --> 00:18:23.270\nAnd you might need to have like,\nwell, I can't unmerge the cells.\n\n354\n00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:25.210\nWell, then maybe you make a copy.\n\n355\n00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:29.720\nAnd then you make a screen\nreader accessible file, and\n\n356\n00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.700\nthen just take the merge and\ncenters off, okay?\n\n357\n00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:35.210\nSo you could have two different versions\nif you're like, I have to have it for\n\n358\n00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:37.010\none way, have it another way.\n\n359\n00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:39.860\nAnd this is a PC version one.\n\n360\n00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.970\nThere is one where you can\ncheck the compatibility.\n\n361\n00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:48.040\nThe compatibility means the compatibility\n\n362\n00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:51.874\nwith the XLS file format.\n\n363\n00:18:51.874 --> 00:18:56.970\nThe ones that was being used for\n2000, before 2003.\n\n364\n00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:58.030\nThat's-.\n&gt;&gt; Was it then?\n\n365\n00:18:58.030 --> 00:18:59.022\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or\nwas it three years [CROSSTALK]?\n\n366\n00:18:59.022 --> 00:18:59.543\n&gt;&gt; I think it was seven.\n\n367\n00:18:59.543 --> 00:19:00.920\n&gt;&gt; Was it seven?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n368\n00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.450\n&gt;&gt; Okay, am I?\n\n369\n00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:05.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was seven cuz I know where\nI worked when that came out, and\n\n370\n00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.792\nI started working there in 2006.\n\n371\n00:19:07.792 --> 00:19:09.142\n&gt;&gt; Okay. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; So it had to be 2007.\n\n372\n00:19:09.142 --> 00:19:11.942\n&gt;&gt; Wow, I'm confused, well,\nit's been a long time.\n\n373\n00:19:11.942 --> 00:19:14.575\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Long time, that was 11 years ago.\n\n374\n00:19:14.575 --> 00:19:21.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, there are still people\nthat do use very old software.\n\n375\n00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:27.900\nSo it's not, because we always use the\nlatest and greatest software, goodness.\n\n376\n00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.340\nBut there's plenty of organizations\nout there that people might be using\n\n377\n00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:32.240\nOffice 2003.\n\n378\n00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.950\n&gt;&gt; Because it works for them.\n\n379\n00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:37.350\nAnd it costs money to upgrade, so\nwhy upgrade it if what I'm using works?\n\n380\n00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:37.950\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n381\n00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:38.760\n&gt;&gt; That's the mentality.\n\n382\n00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.720\nAnd that's a pretty good argument,\nI've got to be honest with you.\n\n383\n00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.160\n&gt;&gt; I can't argue with that one,\neither, so [LAUGH].\n\n384\n00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:49.940\nBut if you wanted to see, hey,\nis this going to be compatible?\n\n385\n00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.102\nIf you're doing a lot of fancy stuff,\n\n386\n00:19:52.102 --> 00:19:55.558\nI'm pretty sure that tables\nare not supported in 2003.\n\n387\n00:19:55.558 --> 00:19:57.421\nIt doesn't mean that they won't see it,\n\n388\n00:19:57.421 --> 00:20:00.210\nit's just that they won't be\nable to use it as a table.\n\n389\n00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:04.400\nAnd some of the images, like the chart\nformatting, cuz charts have advanced so\n\n390\n00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.500\nmuch, they're probably not\ngonna be able edit it,\n\n391\n00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.240\nbut it will just turn into a picture.\n\n392\n00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.570\nSo those types of things.\n\n393\n00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:15.040\nBut the compatibility check\nIs only in Office PC,\n\n394\n00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:19.810\nso you're not gonna check it and\nget a report basically.\n\n395\n00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:23.210\nBut if you needed to, you could just do\na file save as, and then it'll just give\n\n396\n00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:26.590\nwarnings, or just like, this is\ngonna be an image, and that's fine.\n\n397\n00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:29.770\nSo that's what we've got\nin document properties.\n\n398\n00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:33.790\nOur metadata, why and how to affect it,\nyour accessibility, which is important.\n\n399\n00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:37.760\nCheck it in the Tools menu,\nbecause that's where it lives.\n\n400\n00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:41.203\nIt's not in the File menu,\nlike the Backstage view in PC.\n\n401\n00:20:41.203 --> 00:20:43.590\nAnd compatibility,\nthat's a PC-only thing too.\n\n402\n00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:47.130\nBut those are all the things I'd like to\ntalk about in this particular episode,\n\n403\n00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:48.750\nand we're done.\n\n404\n00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:50.970\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nit is cool that you have removed the veil,\n\n405\n00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:54.180\nthat we may see that there actually\nis a vast ocean underneath us.\n\n406\n00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:57.180\nIt's not just the surface that\nwe need to pay attention to.\n\n407\n00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:00.380\nEvery now and then, you will need to dive\ninto these document properties, maybe for\n\n408\n00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:04.880\nsearch functionality or\nto just glean some more information, or\n\n409\n00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.650\nmaybe hide some information that you only\nwant certain people to be able to see.\n\n410\n00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:09.390\nSo very cool now that you know it's there.\n\n411\n00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:11.480\nYou can use it at your whim and will.\n\n412\n00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.010\nVonne, thanks for\nexploring that with us and\n\n413\n00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:15.070\nshowing us that we can actually do that.\n\n414\n00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:17.600\nBut I think it is time for\nus to call it yet another day.\n\n415\n00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:18.900\nThank you for joining us, everyone.\n\n416\n00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:21.680\nSigning off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n417\n00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:22.540\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n418\n00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.102\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n419\n00:21:24.102 --> 00:21:28.718\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

I mean, well, it is kind of a lead in\nbecause in Ready Player One, the book,\n\n34\n00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:20.616\nhe's customizing his environments and\nhe gets a special haptic suit and\n\n35\n00:01:20.616 --> 00:01:22.003\nall this kind of fun stuff.\n\n36\n00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:24.945\nAnd that's exactly, well,\nnot exactly [LAUGH].\n\n37\n00:01:24.945 --> 00:01:28.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We're doing that\nvery thing here today [LAUGH].\n\n38\n00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.520\n&gt;&gt; Logging into the oasis.\n\n39\n00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.024\nNo, no, we're gonna log in to Excel and\ncustomize our interface, okay?\n\n40\n00:01:35.024 --> 00:01:39.975\nSo we've talked a little bit about this\nin the Excel Essentials series where we\n\n41\n00:01:39.975 --> 00:01:41.401\ncustomize a ribbon and\n\n42\n00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:46.444\nwe were just getting familiar with the\nenvironment of the interface by itself.\n\n43\n00:01:46.444 --> 00:01:49.470\nWell, it's gonna take us\nthe next step further.\n\n44\n00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.540\nThat's why it's in the advanced series,\nto where we can customize the ribbon.\n\n45\n00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.198\nYes, you can do that.\n\n46\n00:01:56.198 --> 00:01:58.150\nI know fancy, fancy, right?\n\n47\n00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.785\n&gt;&gt; What's going on?\n\n48\n00:01:59.785 --> 00:02:01.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Do you want to do this?\n\n49\n00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.895\nIt's totally up to you, okay?\n\n50\n00:02:02.895 --> 00:02:04.010\nIt's to where hey,\n\n51\n00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.930\nmaybe I'm using things all day long that\nare on a couple of different ribbons,\n\n52\n00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.800\nand wouldn't it be nice if I had all the\nthings I'm always using all in one place?\n\n53\n00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.440\nSo it's kind of like if I put it\nall in one tab, on the ribbon,\n\n54\n00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.272\nthat is my custom tab,\nthat might be a little bit easier.\n\n55\n00:02:22.272 --> 00:02:26.420\nI mean, that's the whole reason why we\ncustomize the quick access tool bar\n\n56\n00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.660\nis to put commonly used items or\ncommands that I want to quickly access,\n\n57\n00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.855\nthat would be kind of cool.\n\n58\n00:02:32.855 --> 00:02:35.956\nSo, I'm gonna show you how\nto customize the ribbon, and\n\n59\n00:02:35.956 --> 00:02:39.766\nthen we're gonna go over just kind\nof through the Excel preferences,\n\n60\n00:02:39.766 --> 00:02:43.920\njust highlighting a few things that\nmight be worth your while to go through.\n\n61\n00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.810\nIt's like, we're gonna go through\nevery single one of them?\n\n62\n00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.590\nI'll just pick out the points\nthat I think, hey, look for\n\n63\n00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.697\nthat because sometimes you can get your\nExcel files, and why is it doing this?\n\n64\n00:02:55.697 --> 00:02:57.427\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And it's some weird check box on\n\n65\n00:02:57.427 --> 00:02:58.380\nthe preference.\n\n66\n00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.450\n&gt;&gt; That's my favorite.\n\n67\n00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.030\n&gt;&gt; I know, right [LAUGH].\n\n68\n00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.530\n&gt;&gt; My favorite thing ever, yes.\n\n69\n00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.890\n&gt;&gt; Gosh, and it's just like,\nhow did it even get to that?\n\n70\n00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.540\nYou probably did some weird shortcut,\nand you have no idea.\n\n71\n00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.965\n&gt;&gt; You accidentally leaned\non your keyboard, it's like!\n\n72\n00:03:09.965 --> 00:03:10.793\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n73\n00:03:10.793 --> 00:03:13.050\nthen two weeks later you realize\nthat was a key combination.\n\n74\n00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.109\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n75\n00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:16.670\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, stranger things have happened.\n\n76\n00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:17.633\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n77\n00:03:17.633 --> 00:03:21.645\n&gt;&gt; So\nlet's get into customizing our ribbon.\n\n78\n00:03:21.645 --> 00:03:26.385\nSo I have just a blank workbook because\nI needed to have Excel opened, and\n\n79\n00:03:26.385 --> 00:03:30.635\njust a quick review, up here this is\nthe quick access toolbar, up here.\n\n80\n00:03:30.635 --> 00:03:34.498\nSo where we can add other commands,\nand that's fine.\n\n81\n00:03:34.498 --> 00:03:37.108\nAnd you should know, hopefully,\n\n82\n00:03:37.108 --> 00:03:41.698\nby now these are the ribbon tabs,\nso the formulas and data and\n\n83\n00:03:41.698 --> 00:03:47.240\nall that kind of fun stuff, so\nyou can make your own ribbon tab.\n\n84\n00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.620\nShow me how.\n\n85\n00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.560\nThere's a couple ways we can get to it.\n\n86\n00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.820\nIf we go into the Excel menu and go to\nPreferences, cuz we will come back and\n\n87\n00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.870\nexamine a few different things in here in\na little bit, but right there where it\n\n88\n00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.990\nsays Ribbon and Toolbar,\nthat's where you can customize it.\n\n89\n00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.120\nSo they have two different buttons,\nribbon and quick access tool bar,\n\n90\n00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.414\nso this is where you can add them\nto go across the top up here.\n\n91\n00:04:11.414 --> 00:04:14.780\nWe're gonna concentrate on the ribbon and\ngo from there.\n\n92\n00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.174\nSo the ones that we have\nup on the right-hand side,\n\n93\n00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:20.170\nthese are the ones that\nare already existing.\n\n94\n00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.570\nAnd you can see there's\nlittle check boxes by them.\n\n95\n00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.160\nAnd there's a little triangles where\nyou can expand and collapse them.\n\n96\n00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.590\nFor example,\nright now the Home tab is expanded out.\n\n97\n00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.200\nIf I click the class,\nnow you can see Home, Insert, Draw,\n\n98\n00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.052\nwhy is the background removal?\n\n99\n00:04:36.052 --> 00:04:40.830\nRemember, the background removal tab\ncomes up when we do the Remove Background\n\n100\n00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.550\nfrom an image.\n\n101\n00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.030\nWhy that's on?\n\n102\n00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.130\nIt's there, that's fine.\n\n103\n00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.550\nAnd there's other contextual tabs\nthat will pop up along the way.\n\n104\n00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.610\nBut notice it does say the main\ntabs versus all the tabs.\n\n105\n00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.470\nAnd that's where you're going to\nget all of your contextual tabs.\n\n106\n00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.880\nSo the thing is, you can sit here and\n\n107\n00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.820\ncustomize every single one\nof them if you want to.\n\n108\n00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.440\n&gt;&gt; You can go crazy with customizing.\n\n109\n00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n110\n00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.130\n&gt;&gt; Leave nothing that can't be changed.\n\n111\n00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.392\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's one of those, if you\nreally want to mess with people [LAUGH].\n\n112\n00:05:09.392 --> 00:05:10.284\n&gt;&gt; Do some finagling?\n\n113\n00:05:10.284 --> 00:05:14.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthen I can get really like, what?\n\n114\n00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.250\nWhere is my Sort button?\n\n115\n00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.430\nAnd you like removed all of them.\n\n116\n00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.005\n&gt;&gt; It's now called the Pork button.\n\n117\n00:05:19.005 --> 00:05:22.270\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, it gets a little weird there.\n\n118\n00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.840\nSo you can sit here, and if I really\nwanted to for some reason, if I wanted\n\n119\n00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.560\nto take this font group, cuz notice it\nis using by the group names down here.\n\n120\n00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.520\nThat is a preference that I did\ntalk about in the essentials,\n\n121\n00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.560\nI'll review it again once we go over it.\n\n122\n00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.890\nBut I could take this out.\n\n123\n00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.300\nNow why would I wanna take something\nas important as the font group out?\n\n124\n00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.670\nI don't know, but you could.\n\n125\n00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.794\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you find them attractive,\nyou wanna see if there's something there.\n\n126\n00:05:50.794 --> 00:05:51.594\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n127\n00:05:51.594 --> 00:05:52.162\n&gt;&gt; I see what you did there.\n\n128\n00:05:52.162 --> 00:05:52.662\n&gt;&gt; You like what I did there.\n\n129\n00:05:52.662 --> 00:05:53.163\n[LAUGH]\n\n130\n00:05:53.163 --> 00:05:56.467\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So down here at the bottom,\n\n131\n00:05:56.467 --> 00:05:59.876\nwe have our pluses and minuses.\nSo\n\n132\n00:05:59.876 --> 00:06:03.420\nI could take this whole group out, okay?\n\n133\n00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.827\nAnd I could take the cells or\nthe styles, again,\n\n134\n00:06:06.827 --> 00:06:10.825\nthings I would never really\nwant to remove, but you can.\n\n135\n00:06:10.825 --> 00:06:15.576\nWhat if I wanted to take this\nalignment and rename it Pork, or\n\n136\n00:06:15.576 --> 00:06:18.450\nwhatever you said [LAUGH], right?\n\n137\n00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:19.790\nYou could come down here and\n\n138\n00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:24.100\na little wheel thing,\nlittle settings, I could rename this.\n\n139\n00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.410\nAnd I could, sorry, I zoomed out.\n\n140\n00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.240\nIt's up there.\n\n141\n00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.380\nSo we can name it.\n\n142\n00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.421\nWe're gonna go with ham.\n\n143\n00:06:30.421 --> 00:06:32.598\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we click on Save and\n\n144\n00:06:32.598 --> 00:06:34.580\nnow that group is called Ham.\n\n145\n00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.970\nAll right, cuz that makes so much sense.\n\n146\n00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.410\nBut you can see that you can\ngo through each one of them.\n\n147\n00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.100\nYou could go ahead and\ntake out individual commands.\n\n148\n00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.000\nYou could take out whole groups.\n\n149\n00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.470\n&gt;&gt; And you can move things around,\nyou can rename them.\n\n150\n00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:48.540\nMe personally,\n\n151\n00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.930\nI probably wouldn't mess with any of\nthe stuff that's already there, okay?\n\n152\n00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:57.900\nThat was just why it's there, but\nif it really bothers you, you totally can.\n\n153\n00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:02.580\nWhat I would do is make my own ribbon tab.\n\n154\n00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:09.460\nSo I can come down here, and if I click on\nthe little plus sign, I can add a new tab.\n\n155\n00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:15.380\nAnd so there's my new tab, and notice\nhow it automatically makes a new tab and\n\n156\n00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.780\na new group, because you have\nto have a group before you can\n\n157\n00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.240\nadd commands into the ribbon, okay?\n\n158\n00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:28.500\nSo it's like you gotta have those levels,\nokay, or subdomains, right?\n\n159\n00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.115\nOkay, so\nthat's my techiness coming out in there.\n\n160\n00:07:31.115 --> 00:07:32.532\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm being really descriptive, [LAUGH].\n\n175\n00:08:24.117 --> 00:08:27.662\nAnd then depending on which\ngroup I have selected,\n\n176\n00:08:27.662 --> 00:08:32.900\nI'm just gonna randomly grab different\ncommands here and move on over.\n\n177\n00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:37.567\nNotice I can choose from different\npopular commands, all commands,\n\n178\n00:08:37.567 --> 00:08:39.713\nones that are not on the ribbon.\n\n179\n00:08:39.713 --> 00:08:43.079\nThat's sometimes where I know that\nthey exist and maybe it's in a menu,\n\n180\n00:08:43.079 --> 00:08:45.690\nbut I don't wanna keep going to the menu.\n\n181\n00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:48.630\nYou can have this option like\nanything that's not in the ribbon,\n\n182\n00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.260\nlet me go ahead and put in there.\n\n183\n00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:55.920\nThat's fine too, because maybe I wanted\na five point star, I don't know.\n\n184\n00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.828\nI'm not sure if I really need all\nof these, but you get the idea.\n\n185\n00:08:58.828 --> 00:09:00.064\n&gt;&gt; The idea, yeah.\n\n186\n00:09:00.064 --> 00:09:02.811\n&gt;&gt; You move over, you make your groups,\nyou make your tabs.\n\n187\n00:09:02.811 --> 00:09:05.780\nYou could move them up and\ndown if you wanted to.\n\n188\n00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:11.280\nI can see and I can drag this where\nit's below the home tab or above.\n\n189\n00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.180\nHere, let me gonna ahead and make,\noops, come on, let's, come on.\n\n190\n00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:19.320\n[LAUGH] We will move this down,\nwe'll make it easier on myself.\n\n191\n00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:24.150\nOkay, there we go, well,\nanyways, click and drag.\n\n192\n00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:28.338\nIt keeps on expanding them and\nit's not wanting to let me do that.\n\n193\n00:09:28.338 --> 00:09:32.580\nBut I bet if I grab it really quickly,\nokay, you know what?\n\n194\n00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:35.496\nIt's fine where it goes,\nthat's great, [LAUGH] you know what,\n\n195\n00:09:35.496 --> 00:09:36.901\nI won't mess with it too much.\n\n196\n00:09:36.901 --> 00:09:40.312\n&gt;&gt; You get anywhere near those little\ntriangles, and it's just like, expand.\n\n197\n00:09:40.312 --> 00:09:42.339\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know,\nI'm just like, [SOUND] okay, so\n\n198\n00:09:42.339 --> 00:09:45.154\nI've had a little rough time going\non that, but you get the idea.\n\n199\n00:09:45.154 --> 00:09:49.196\nAnd you could drag and drop it if you want\nto, I don't really wanna fight with it,\n\n200\n00:09:49.196 --> 00:09:51.850\nhonestly, so I'm just gonna let it be.\n\n201\n00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:55.598\nThere is something down here when\nyou get into macros and things.\n\n202\n00:09:55.598 --> 00:10:00.353\nThat if you wanted to record macros,\nyou have to turn on the developer tab,\n\n203\n00:10:00.353 --> 00:10:02.325\nnotice it is not on by default.\n\n204\n00:10:02.325 --> 00:10:06.307\nSo if you ever needed even if it's just\nthat, you just need to turn the developer,\n\n205\n00:10:06.307 --> 00:10:10.368\nyou come into the ribbon, turn it on, and\nthen you can turn on and off other things.\n\n206\n00:10:10.368 --> 00:10:14.735\nIf I click Save,\nthen it will go ahead and do all that,\n\n207\n00:10:14.735 --> 00:10:17.980\nnow remember I removed all of that.\n\n208\n00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.330\nI'm like, my gosh, I removed\nthe font group, and the align group.\n\n209\n00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:25.545\nThat's bad, and then Vonne's cool stuff,\nyeah, that's there too, but you know what,\n\n210\n00:10:25.545 --> 00:10:26.819\nI kind of really miss this.\n\n211\n00:10:26.819 --> 00:10:33.642\nSo I took out a lot of important commands,\nif you're like, uh-oh, what did I do?\n\n212\n00:10:33.642 --> 00:10:36.453\nLuckily, if you wanted to, like I do,\n\n213\n00:10:36.453 --> 00:10:41.074\nyou can come back into your preferences,\ngo into your toolbar.\n\n214\n00:10:41.074 --> 00:10:44.432\nAnd then down here on the ribbon toolbar,\nwell, the ribbon,\n\n215\n00:10:44.432 --> 00:10:47.770\nnot the toolbar part,\nthat little wheel down there.\n\n216\n00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:51.840\nThere's a really great way that you\ncan reset all of your customizations,\n\n217\n00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.600\nthat's really good.\n\n218\n00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.580\nNow notice there are two\ndifferent parts right here.\n\n219\n00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:00.318\nThere is a reset all customizations,\nor reset only the ribbon.\n\n220\n00:11:00.318 --> 00:11:05.214\nCuz the quick access toolbar and\nthe ribbon are separate, so\n\n221\n00:11:05.214 --> 00:11:09.430\nyou can reset either one,\nor do all of them.\n\n222\n00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:11.450\nI didn't really do anything to\nthe quick access toolbar but\n\n223\n00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:14.960\nI'm just gonna go with all\njust to cover all my bases.\n\n224\n00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.660\nAnd notice, do you wanna delete\nall of these customizations?\n\n225\n00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:23.734\nYeah, I'm gonna have to\ndelete all my cool stuff,\n\n226\n00:11:23.734 --> 00:11:29.994\nbut if I click yes and then let it\ndo its thing and, did you do it?\n\n227\n00:11:29.994 --> 00:11:33.232\nLet's go ahead and reset, delete,\n\n228\n00:11:33.232 --> 00:11:38.254\nyes I want to delete, okay,\nand then it is going to do it.\n\n229\n00:11:38.254 --> 00:11:40.350\n&gt;&gt; Probably when you go back into the box.\n\n230\n00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:44.517\n&gt;&gt; That was kinda weird, cuz I was like-\n&gt;&gt; You wanted to see it change\n\n231\n00:11:44.517 --> 00:11:46.670\nbefore your very eyes.\n\n232\n00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:49.525\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I did, I wanted to see it\nchange in that ribbon and then be like,\n\n233\n00:11:49.525 --> 00:11:52.013\nand that little save button,\ndid you notice that on there?\n\n234\n00:11:52.013 --> 00:11:54.930\nThe save customizations,\nit wasn't letting me save it.\n\n235\n00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:59.600\nSo that's why I was like, is this gonna\nwork, [LAUGH] did we find another bug?\n\n236\n00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:05.479\nBut notice I just closed out of the\npreferences, the whole preference window.\n\n237\n00:12:05.479 --> 00:12:09.080\nAnd now I have my font back, I have\nmy alignment, everything's back, and\n\n238\n00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.920\nall the cool stuff that I made is gone.\n\n239\n00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:15.112\nSo if it trips up on you too,\nhopefully you can just close it out and\n\n240\n00:12:15.112 --> 00:12:19.170\neverything should be fine,\nso there you go, nice.\n\n241\n00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:22.713\nThere is one thing in the PC\nversion that you can do.\n\n242\n00:12:22.713 --> 00:12:25.812\nYou can import and\nexport your customization settings.\n\n243\n00:12:25.812 --> 00:12:28.341\nCuz if you think about it, it's an Office\nproduct, so it has some special-\n\n244\n00:12:28.341 --> 00:12:29.847\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna migrate from computer to\n\n245\n00:12:29.847 --> 00:12:32.631\nanother, you wanna have all these\ncool settings you've all created and\n\n246\n00:12:32.631 --> 00:12:34.652\ngotten used to,\nthat's how you import and export.\n\n247\n00:12:34.652 --> 00:12:36.654\n&gt;&gt; And on a Windows machine,\n\n248\n00:12:36.654 --> 00:12:41.024\nit's some crazy weird Microsoft\nextension file thing.\n\n249\n00:12:41.024 --> 00:12:45.406\nWell, it doesn't really work on the Mac,\nso you can't customize and\n\n250\n00:12:45.406 --> 00:12:49.980\nthen export those customization\nsettings to transfer over to another.\n\n251\n00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:53.726\n&gt;&gt; So what I'm hearing is to\neffectively run Excel on your Mac,\n\n252\n00:12:53.726 --> 00:12:59.021\nyou install Windows on your Mac and then\ninstall Excel, and everything works great.\n\n253\n00:12:59.021 --> 00:13:03.323\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't know if I'd go\nthat far, but I'm sure there's plenty\n\n254\n00:13:03.323 --> 00:13:07.263\nof people out there that would be\non your side, to each its own.\n\n255\n00:13:07.263 --> 00:13:08.458\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] operating system.\n\n256\n00:13:08.458 --> 00:13:10.432\n&gt;&gt; Well, I mean, a little side story,\n\n257\n00:13:10.432 --> 00:13:14.332\nwe do have someone in the office\nwho's a suoer, super number cruncher.\n\n258\n00:13:14.332 --> 00:13:19.241\nHe's our data analysis guy, and\nhe tried using Excel on Mac.\n\n259\n00:13:19.241 --> 00:13:21.503\n&gt;&gt; He said no, he said,\nthis is not, uh-uh.\n\n260\n00:13:21.503 --> 00:13:28.347\n&gt;&gt; He couldn't, yeah, for what he did, the\nlevel of sophistication that he needed for\n\n261\n00:13:28.347 --> 00:13:32.962\nspecific tools or\nthird party extensions and add-ins.\n\n262\n00:13:32.962 --> 00:13:37.888\nHe couldn't function within that\nenvironment, and it was also cuz he was\n\n263\n00:13:37.888 --> 00:13:41.594\nalso very used to using-\n&gt;&gt; A Windows environment, so I've been\n\n264\n00:13:41.594 --> 00:13:45.915\nthere, jumped from a Windows environment\nonly, now here's your Mac, enjoy.\n\n265\n00:13:45.915 --> 00:13:48.334\nAnd you're like, why's everything\non the wrong side of the screen?\n\n266\n00:13:48.334 --> 00:13:49.702\nWhere is everything,\n\n267\n00:13:49.702 --> 00:13:53.303\nwhy when I right-click stuff\nis there not a delete button?\n\n268\n00:13:53.303 --> 00:13:57.980\n&gt;&gt; And I won't lie, Excel for\nMac, it is different.\n\n269\n00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:00.840\nThat’s why I have two different series.\n\n270\n00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.659\nOtherwise, I would just\ndo it all together.\n\n271\n00:14:02.659 --> 00:14:05.149\nBut it is different enough,\n\n272\n00:14:05.149 --> 00:14:08.121\nthe higher up you go-\n&gt;&gt; The more the differences start to\n\n273\n00:14:08.121 --> 00:14:08.752\nshow themselves.\n\n274\n00:14:08.752 --> 00:14:13.661\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and\nI would say in Excel is the most.\n\n275\n00:14:13.661 --> 00:14:16.919\nWord, not as much, to me,\nyou can go pretty high up-\n\n276\n00:14:16.919 --> 00:14:19.175\n&gt;&gt; That’s like their main product, right,\n\n277\n00:14:19.175 --> 00:14:22.820\nthat and probably Outlook are probably\ntheir two big heavy hitters.\n\n278\n00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:27.690\nExcel, while probably third on that list,\nstill is third on that list.\n\n279\n00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:31.278\n&gt;&gt; And I think this is also,\nwhat circles do you travel in?\n\n280\n00:14:31.278 --> 00:14:33.457\nAnd he would be like,\nI never use Word, I only use Excel.\n\n281\n00:14:33.457 --> 00:14:37.129\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, do you know when the last\ntime I used Excel was, never.\n\n282\n00:14:37.129 --> 00:14:38.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I use it every day.\n\n283\n00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:40.836\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just have no need for it.\n\n284\n00:14:40.836 --> 00:14:48.720\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and this is a perfect lead\nin to right here, the preferences alone.\n\n285\n00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:53.630\nIf you look at the Excel\npreferences in Mac,\n\n286\n00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:58.417\nit's this big versus this big in Windows.\n\n287\n00:14:58.417 --> 00:15:01.116\nOf all of the different preferences and\noptions that you can have.\n\n288\n00:15:01.116 --> 00:15:06.226\nSo it's just,\nit is limiting to some people, to me,\n\n289\n00:15:06.226 --> 00:15:11.347\nit's fine, I don't need,\nI'm not a data analyst.\n\n290\n00:15:11.347 --> 00:15:13.876\n&gt;&gt; All the core functionality is there,\nso you're fine.\n\n291\n00:15:13.876 --> 00:15:18.859\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah, this isn't my,\nlike our co-worker, that's what he does.\n\n292\n00:15:18.859 --> 00:15:22.455\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, he needs every\nlittle bell and whistle he can get.\n\n293\n00:15:22.455 --> 00:15:25.963\nSo obviously moving to the Windows side\nof things was the better choice for him.\n\n294\n00:15:25.963 --> 00:15:28.447\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's all about what\nyou're most familiar with, and\n\n295\n00:15:28.447 --> 00:15:29.875\nwhich way you can be most effective.\n\n296\n00:15:29.875 --> 00:15:32.867\n&gt;&gt; That's the key point,\nand hopefully try and\n\n297\n00:15:32.867 --> 00:15:38.392\nmake you a little bit more effective and\nefficient using your Excel product on Mac.\n\n298\n00:15:38.392 --> 00:15:39.249\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n299\n00:15:39.249 --> 00:15:41.245\n&gt;&gt; There you go, all right,\na little detour, but.\n\n300\n00:15:41.245 --> 00:15:42.353\n&gt;&gt; I think it was worth it.\n\n301\n00:15:42.353 --> 00:15:42.983\n&gt;&gt; It's always the fun little detours.\n\n302\n00:15:42.983 --> 00:15:44.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's good stuff.\n\n303\n00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:45.305\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I love the bantering.\n\n304\n00:15:45.305 --> 00:15:48.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, so how do we get to this?\n\n305\n00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:52.592\nBecause of the settings, and\nI'm just gonna show that it\n\n306\n00:15:52.592 --> 00:15:57.560\ndidn't have any option here To export,\nor import customizations.\n\n307\n00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.780\n&gt;&gt; Got you.\n&gt;&gt; You will see that in the PC version,\n\n308\n00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:03.470\njust because you can, all right?\n\n309\n00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:06.070\nThe biggetst customation I do, personally,\n\n310\n00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:08.679\nI will add things to\nthe Quick Access toolbar.\n\n311\n00:16:08.679 --> 00:16:10.550\nDo I go and make my own ribbons?\n\n312\n00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:14.927\nI do for examples and I have every\nonce in a while and just for fun.\n\n313\n00:16:14.927 --> 00:16:18.286\n&gt;&gt; I found that I get too used to that,\nand then to explore,\n\n314\n00:16:18.286 --> 00:16:23.164\nbecause I sit down behind someone else's\nExcel wheel and go this is wrong [LAUGH].\n\n315\n00:16:23.164 --> 00:16:24.212\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n316\n00:16:24.212 --> 00:16:24.716\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n317\n00:16:24.716 --> 00:16:28.243\n&gt;&gt; But that's how like 99% of the time I\nwould experience it if I moved away from\n\n318\n00:16:28.243 --> 00:16:29.374\nmy own customizations.\n\n319\n00:16:29.374 --> 00:16:30.125\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n320\n00:16:30.125 --> 00:16:32.056\n&gt;&gt; So, I just stick with the standard.\n\n321\n00:16:32.056 --> 00:16:32.683\n&gt;&gt; I feel you.\n\n322\n00:16:32.683 --> 00:16:34.905\n&gt;&gt; And supporting Office\nproducts throughout the years,\n\n323\n00:16:34.905 --> 00:16:36.842\nI've noticed that when\npeople get in the weeds,\n\n324\n00:16:36.842 --> 00:16:39.268\nit's because they start customizing and\nchanging things.\n\n325\n00:16:39.268 --> 00:16:41.815\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then, they get a new computer.\n\n326\n00:16:41.815 --> 00:16:43.882\nAnd they go, where's all my stuff?\n\n327\n00:16:43.882 --> 00:16:46.105\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I go, I don't know.\n\n328\n00:16:46.105 --> 00:16:48.719\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Cuz you made some weird stuff.\n\n329\n00:16:48.719 --> 00:16:49.836\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We don't know where it lives.\n\n330\n00:16:49.836 --> 00:16:50.847\n&gt;&gt; Good luck getting that back.\n\n331\n00:16:50.847 --> 00:16:54.032\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yep, I hear you.\n\n332\n00:16:54.032 --> 00:16:56.456\nI hear you.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, stick with the base model.\n\n333\n00:16:56.456 --> 00:16:57.793\nIt's the way to fly.\n\n334\n00:16:57.793 --> 00:17:03.220\n&gt;&gt;
