TV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.182 --> 00:00:15.249\nMy name is Vonne Smith, and\nin this course overview,\n\n4\n00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:19.900\nwe're going to be discussing what\nexactly are we covering in this series?\n\n5\n00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.490\nWho is our target audience?\n\n6\n00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.840\nDo I need to know anything\nbefore starting this series?\n\n7\n00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.729\nAnd some extra tips and tricks.\n\n8\n00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:30.000\nSo what are we going to be\ncovering in this series?\n\n9\n00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.891\nWe have it broken up into\ntwo main areas or topics.\n\n10\n00:00:33.891 --> 00:00:36.820\nWe have our introduction and\nour format workbooks.\n\n11\n00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.754\nAnd in the introduction, we're gonna\nbe covering the very, very basics,\n\n12\n00:00:40.754 --> 00:00:43.660\nstarting off with well,\nwhat exactly is Excel?\n\n13\n00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.620\nI have a PowerPoint presentation that\ngoes along to just really talk about like\n\n14\n00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.570\nthis is a spreadsheet application.\n\n15\n00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.186\nWhat does that exactly mean?\n\n16\n00:00:51.186 --> 00:00:53.700\nWell go ahead and\nwatch that episode and you'll find out.\n\n17\n00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.210\nWe then go ahead and move into just\nsome Windows and Excel basics.\n\n18\n00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.301\nLike how do I open a file,\nhow do I save a file?\n\n19\n00:01:01.301 --> 00:01:03.230\nWhere do I go to print a file?\n\n20\n00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.000\nWhat about the Excel environment?\n\n21\n00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.782\nWhat is a ribbon?\n\n22\n00:01:06.782 --> 00:01:08.540\nWhat is a quick access toolbar?\n\n23\n00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.130\nWhere do I go to customize\nthat quick access tool bar?\n\n24\n00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.580\nWhat's the status bar?\n\n25\n00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.570\nSo we'll be covering all of those basics\nin some of those introductory episodes.\n\n26\n00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.820\nWe'll also talk about how to\nnavigate within a workbook.\n\n27\n00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.842\nHow to get to our different worksheets,\nand how to select cells,\n\n28\n00:01:24.842 --> 00:01:27.768\nand what does it mean to\nhave an active cell, and\n\n29\n00:01:27.768 --> 00:01:31.746\nwhat to look for when we want to\neither move or copy information.\n\n30\n00:01:31.746 --> 00:01:36.518\nThen we'll start selecting our information\nto be able to do what I just said which is\n\n31\n00:01:36.518 --> 00:01:39.390\ncopy and paste and\ndo all those different things.\n\n32\n00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.665\nAnd it's all about our mouse cursor icons,\nso\n\n33\n00:01:42.665 --> 00:01:48.130\na really important area to\nreally focus on in Excel.\n\n34\n00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.931\nThen we're gonna be, well,\ninserting some data.\n\n35\n00:01:49.931 --> 00:01:53.070\nWe'll be putting in text,\nwe'll be putting in numbers.\n\n36\n00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.520\nAnd then how do I do some really\ncool things with some fill series?\n\n37\n00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.920\nAnd the flash fill,\njust watch that episode.\n\n38\n00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.230\nYou'll be amazed at what this\nproduct can do for us and\n\n39\n00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.650\nit's intelligent services if you would\nsay of how it's gotten so smart for us.\n\n40\n00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.817\nIt just knows what we want to do.\n\n41\n00:02:11.817 --> 00:02:16.597\nAnd we'll also be covering how to export\nyour information out into different file\n\n42\n00:02:16.597 --> 00:02:21.330\nformats, talking about like CSVs and\ndifferent ways that you can make PDFs.\n\n43\n00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.073\nSo how to get that file into like it's\nfinal format to where you need to work\n\n44\n00:02:26.073 --> 00:02:26.761\nwith it and\n\n45\n00:02:26.761 --> 00:02:31.595\nbe able to send it off to maybe some\nother people within your organization.\n\n46\n00:02:31.595 --> 00:02:35.840\nThen we'll get in to formatting, and\nformat really mean change and modify.\n\n47\n00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.060\nSo we're going to be modifying\nthe structures of our Excel workbooks and\n\n48\n00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.140\nworksheets with changing our\ncolumn widths, our row heights.\n\n49\n00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.240\nHow do I add or delete columns and rows.\n\n50\n00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.230\nHow do I hide things?\n\n51\n00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.300\nHow do I unhide things?\n\n52\n00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.990\nSo we'll be covering all of that.\n\n53\n00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.374\nWe'll also be formatting\nin the sense of what,\n\n54\n00:02:53.374 --> 00:02:56.532\nmaybe a lot of people think of as\nformatting as painting a font,\n\n55\n00:02:56.532 --> 00:03:00.788\nmaking things bold, changing the colors\nof different things, what about a style?\n\n56\n00:03:00.788 --> 00:03:04.777\nHow can I work with that and\nthen how can I change my themes.\n\n57\n00:03:04.777 --> 00:03:09.130\nWe'll also, they're all important\nnumber formats, that's a big one like,\n\n58\n00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.010\nwhy is it when I type this number in,\nit's changing it to a date?\n\n59\n00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.851\nWhy does it do that?\n\n60\n00:03:13.851 --> 00:03:15.820\nHow can I make it stop doing that?\n\n61\n00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.540\nHow can I enforce it to do\nthose different things?\n\n62\n00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.020\nCustom number formats as well.\n\n63\n00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.800\nSo lots of good information in\nour number format episodes.\n\n64\n00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.902\nWe'll also be covering how to change\nthe page layout for printing.\n\n65\n00:03:27.902 --> 00:03:30.450\nSuch as doing our page breaks,\nhow to put in headers and\n\n66\n00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.610\nfooters, change the margins and\norientations of our workbooks.\n\n67\n00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.420\nAnd then we'll end up on our\nmanaging our workbooks and\n\n68\n00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.921\nworksheets, how do I\nchange my sheet names,\n\n69\n00:03:40.921 --> 00:03:46.410\nchange the reorganization of those sheet\ntabs as to where I want them to show.\n\n70\n00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:52.150\nAnd how to copy and paste different\nworksheets within multiple workbooks.\n\n71\n00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.925\nSo covering all the essentials\nof working with Excel.\n\n72\n00:03:56.925 --> 00:04:02.520\nNow one topic that we will not be covering\nin this particular series is calculations.\n\n73\n00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.620\nHow to create formulas and\nfunctions within Excel.\n\n74\n00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.380\nThat is an entirely separate\nseries that I have taken.\n\n75\n00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.960\nCuz you can use Excel for two different\nways, to just organize your information,\n\n76\n00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.590\nand or calculate your functions and be\nable to do really do this number crunches.\n\n77\n00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.470\nAnd I wanted to separate those out to\nreally focus on those two different\n\n78\n00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.220\nmain things that Excel does for us.\n\n79\n00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.635\nSo who's our talk audience\nin this particular series?\n\n80\n00:04:30.635 --> 00:04:32.375\nThis is all Office users.\n\n81\n00:04:32.375 --> 00:04:34.823\nNow notice that Office is capitalized,\n\n82\n00:04:34.823 --> 00:04:37.991\nmeaning Office within\nthe Microsoft Office Suite.\n\n83\n00:04:37.991 --> 00:04:42.292\nIt doesn't mean that you have to work in\nan office, like a physical location to be\n\n84\n00:04:42.292 --> 00:04:46.210\nable to use this particular series\nin this particular product.\n\n85\n00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.250\nBecause it can be in a large organization\nor you can be the power of one and\n\n86\n00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.070\njust have yourself being\nable to use Excel.\n\n87\n00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.970\nThis does start from the very\nbeginning in our foundation.\n\n88\n00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.620\nSo it takes our basic information and\ngoes up to,\n\n89\n00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.894\nI would say maybe an intermediate level.\n\n90\n00:05:00.894 --> 00:05:05.748\nAnd this is where I, we talked about in\nsome of our episodes to where people maybe\n\n91\n00:05:05.748 --> 00:05:10.470\nskip over all of the basics of Excel and\nthen go right into the harder stuff.\n\n92\n00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.350\nAnd then when you start kinda\ngetting those problems, you're like,\n\n93\n00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:14.270\nwhy isn't this working?\n\n94\n00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.587\nIt's going back to basics, learning those\nfoundations that can really help you.\n\n95\n00:05:18.587 --> 00:05:21.540\nAnd everyone's like,\nthat's why that does that.\n\n96\n00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.946\nSo we'll be hitting all of that, and\nhopefully you can gain a nice foundational\n\n97\n00:05:25.946 --> 00:05:29.849\nknowledge, even if you actually have\nbeen using Excel for some time.\n\n98\n00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:32.110\nWhat do you need to know\nabout before we get started?\n\n99\n00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.597\nWell, you need to have some familiarity\nwith just the Windows operating system in\n\n100\n00:05:36.597 --> 00:05:37.189\ngeneral.\n\n101\n00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:41.894\nBut you don't have to have any prior\nknowledge of Excel to be able to\n\n102\n00:05:41.894 --> 00:05:44.343\nexcel in this particular series.\n\n103\n00:05:44.343 --> 00:05:49.025\nNow if you have used other Office products\nsuch as Word, or Outlook, or PowerPoint,\n\n104\n00:05:49.025 --> 00:05:52.666\nthen some of those things,\nthey cover all of the Office products,\n\n105\n00:05:52.666 --> 00:05:55.610\nthings like the ribbon and\nthe click access toolbar.\n\n106\n00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.800\nSo you might be very familiar with\nsome of those, but then when you get\n\n107\n00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.910\ninto how does Excel really work, that's\nwhere you're gonna have that difference.\n\n108\n00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.530\nTips and tricks, our little extras.\n\n109\n00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:12.400\nThere's always multiple ways to do the\nsame thing in any of your Office products.\n\n110\n00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.910\nSo while I might show you ways one,\ntwo and three,\n\n111\n00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.920\nthere might be four and five and six.\n\n112\n00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.750\nThere might be other ways to do things\nthat I might not specifically cover\n\n113\n00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:21.790\nin these episodes.\n\n114\n00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.860\nSo, they're out there,\nthey do the same thing.\n\n115\n00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.420\nSo if you have a different way of doing\nit than I do, that's totally fine.\n\n116\n00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.480\nAs long as you can get to that same\nending point then that's good.\n\n117\n00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.570\nUpdates happen, yes they do.\n\n118\n00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:41.260\nAnd depending on if you're on\na Office 365 subscription and\n\n119\n00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.390\nwhen you're updates are scheduled,\n\n120\n00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:48.760\nyou might not have some of the same\nthings that I have because you're for\n\n121\n00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:54.570\na later update than I was on when\nI was filming these episodes.\n\n122\n00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:59.260\nSo do take that into account,\nthat things might look a little different.\n\n123\n00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.985\nAnd then more than just that,\nyou have different versions of Excel.\n\n124\n00:07:02.985 --> 00:07:04.710\nYou're like, different versions?\n\n125\n00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.910\nWhat I mean by that is\nsubscription levels.\n\n126\n00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:08.800\nI have a Enterprise license.\n\n127\n00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.610\nYou might not have\na Enterprise license and\n\n128\n00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.130\nthat might be why I see\na certain button and you don't.\n\n129\n00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:18.970\nYour network, your IT people that are\nsetting up your particular computer and\n\n130\n00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.530\nwhere you're working in\na large organization,\n\n131\n00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:25.660\nthey might have locked certain features\ndown of your Office products or\n\n132\n00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.520\nyour subscriptions that you can't access.\n\n133\n00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.440\nSo you will have that from time\nto time that will make things\n\n134\n00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.280\nlook a little different.\n\n135\n00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.020\nOf course always searching for\nthe answers.\n\n136\n00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.930\nLike why does mine not look like yours.\n\n137\n00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.510\nYou might be able to find that by,\nwell as we say, consulting the oracle and\n\n138\n00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:44.820\ngoing out to Google or Bing or to whatever\nsearch engine you have to go ahead and\n\n139\n00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.250\nget all that information.\n\n140\n00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:49.970\nEverybody uses this product differently.\n\n141\n00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.560\nI might use Excel differently than you,\nand\n\n142\n00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.780\nyou might really need to just\nperform calculations
