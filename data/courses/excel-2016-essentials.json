TV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.182 --> 00:00:15.249\nMy name is Vonne Smith, and\nin this course overview,\n\n4\n00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:19.900\nwe're going to be discussing what\nexactly are we covering in this series?\n\n5\n00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.490\nWho is our target audience?\n\n6\n00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.840\nDo I need to know anything\nbefore starting this series?\n\n7\n00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.729\nAnd some extra tips and tricks.\n\n8\n00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:30.000\nSo what are we going to be\ncovering in this series?\n\n9\n00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.891\nWe have it broken up into\ntwo main areas or topics.\n\n10\n00:00:33.891 --> 00:00:36.820\nWe have our introduction and\nour format workbooks.\n\n11\n00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.754\nAnd in the introduction, we're gonna\nbe covering the very, very basics,\n\n12\n00:00:40.754 --> 00:00:43.660\nstarting off with well,\nwhat exactly is Excel?\n\n13\n00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.620\nI have a PowerPoint presentation that\ngoes along to just really talk about like\n\n14\n00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.570\nthis is a spreadsheet application.\n\n15\n00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.186\nWhat does that exactly mean?\n\n16\n00:00:51.186 --> 00:00:53.700\nWell go ahead and\nwatch that episode and you'll find out.\n\n17\n00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.210\nWe then go ahead and move into just\nsome Windows and Excel basics.\n\n18\n00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.301\nLike how do I open a file,\nhow do I save a file?\n\n19\n00:01:01.301 --> 00:01:03.230\nWhere do I go to print a file?\n\n20\n00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.000\nWhat about the Excel environment?\n\n21\n00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.782\nWhat is a ribbon?\n\n22\n00:01:06.782 --> 00:01:08.540\nWhat is a quick access toolbar?\n\n23\n00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.130\nWhere do I go to customize\nthat quick access tool bar?\n\n24\n00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.580\nWhat's the status bar?\n\n25\n00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.570\nSo we'll be covering all of those basics\nin some of those introductory episodes.\n\n26\n00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.820\nWe'll also talk about how to\nnavigate within a workbook.\n\n27\n00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.842\nHow to get to our different worksheets,\nand how to select cells,\n\n28\n00:01:24.842 --> 00:01:27.768\nand what does it mean to\nhave an active cell, and\n\n29\n00:01:27.768 --> 00:01:31.746\nwhat to look for when we want to\neither move or copy information.\n\n30\n00:01:31.746 --> 00:01:36.518\nThen we'll start selecting our information\nto be able to do what I just said which is\n\n31\n00:01:36.518 --> 00:01:39.390\ncopy and paste and\ndo all those different things.\n\n32\n00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.665\nAnd it's all about our mouse cursor icons,\nso\n\n33\n00:01:42.665 --> 00:01:48.130\na really important area to\nreally focus on in Excel.\n\n34\n00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.931\nThen we're gonna be, well,\ninserting some data.\n\n35\n00:01:49.931 --> 00:01:53.070\nWe'll be putting in text,\nwe'll be putting in numbers.\n\n36\n00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.520\nAnd then how do I do some really\ncool things with some fill series?\n\n37\n00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.920\nAnd the flash fill,\njust watch that episode.\n\n38\n00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.230\nYou'll be amazed at what this\nproduct can do for us and\n\n39\n00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.650\nit's intelligent services if you would\nsay of how it's gotten so smart for us.\n\n40\n00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.817\nIt just knows what we want to do.\n\n41\n00:02:11.817 --> 00:02:16.597\nAnd we'll also be covering how to export\nyour information out into different file\n\n42\n00:02:16.597 --> 00:02:21.330\nformats, talking about like CSVs and\ndifferent ways that you can make PDFs.\n\n43\n00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.073\nSo how to get that file into like it's\nfinal format to where you need to work\n\n44\n00:02:26.073 --> 00:02:26.761\nwith it and\n\n45\n00:02:26.761 --> 00:02:31.595\nbe able to send it off to maybe some\nother people within your organization.\n\n46\n00:02:31.595 --> 00:02:35.840\nThen we'll get in to formatting, and\nformat really mean change and modify.\n\n47\n00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.060\nSo we're going to be modifying\nthe structures of our Excel workbooks and\n\n48\n00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.140\nworksheets with changing our\ncolumn widths, our row heights.\n\n49\n00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.240\nHow do I add or delete columns and rows.\n\n50\n00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.230\nHow do I hide things?\n\n51\n00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.300\nHow do I unhide things?\n\n52\n00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.990\nSo we'll be covering all of that.\n\n53\n00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.374\nWe'll also be formatting\nin the sense of what,\n\n54\n00:02:53.374 --> 00:02:56.532\nmaybe a lot of people think of as\nformatting as painting a font,\n\n55\n00:02:56.532 --> 00:03:00.788\nmaking things bold, changing the colors\nof different things, what about a style?\n\n56\n00:03:00.788 --> 00:03:04.777\nHow can I work with that and\nthen how can I change my themes.\n\n57\n00:03:04.777 --> 00:03:09.130\nWe'll also, they're all important\nnumber formats, that's a big one like,\n\n58\n00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.010\nwhy is it when I type this number in,\nit's changing it to a date?\n\n59\n00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.851\nWhy does it do that?\n\n60\n00:03:13.851 --> 00:03:15.820\nHow can I make it stop doing that?\n\n61\n00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.540\nHow can I enforce it to do\nthose different things?\n\n62\n00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.020\nCustom number formats as well.\n\n63\n00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.800\nSo lots of good information in\nour number format episodes.\n\n64\n00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.902\nWe'll also be covering how to change\nthe page layout for printing.\n\n65\n00:03:27.902 --> 00:03:30.450\nSuch as doing our page breaks,\nhow to put in headers and\n\n66\n00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.610\nfooters, change the margins and\norientations of our workbooks.\n\n67\n00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.420\nAnd then we'll end up on our\nmanaging our workbooks and\n\n68\n00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.921\nworksheets, how do I\nchange my sheet names,\n\n69\n00:03:40.921 --> 00:03:46.410\nchange the reorganization of those sheet\ntabs as to where I want them to show.\n\n70\n00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:52.150\nAnd how to copy and paste different\nworksheets within multiple workbooks.\n\n71\n00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.925\nSo covering all the essentials\nof working with Excel.\n\n72\n00:03:56.925 --> 00:04:02.520\nNow one topic that we will not be covering\nin this particular series is calculations.\n\n73\n00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.620\nHow to create formulas and\nfunctions within Excel.\n\n74\n00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.380\nThat is an entirely separate\nseries that I have taken.\n\n75\n00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.960\nCuz you can use Excel for two different\nways, to just organize your information,\n\n76\n00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.590\nand or calculate your functions and be\nable to do really do this number crunches.\n\n77\n00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.470\nAnd I wanted to separate those out to\nreally focus on those two different\n\n78\n00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.220\nmain things that Excel does for us.\n\n79\n00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.635\nSo who's our talk audience\nin this particular series?\n\n80\n00:04:30.635 --> 00:04:32.375\nThis is all Office users.\n\n81\n00:04:32.375 --> 00:04:34.823\nNow notice that Office is capitalized,\n\n82\n00:04:34.823 --> 00:04:37.991\nmeaning Office within\nthe Microsoft Office Suite.\n\n83\n00:04:37.991 --> 00:04:42.292\nIt doesn't mean that you have to work in\nan office, like a physical location to be\n\n84\n00:04:42.292 --> 00:04:46.210\nable to use this particular series\nin this particular product.\n\n85\n00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.250\nBecause it can be in a large organization\nor you can be the power of one and\n\n86\n00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.070\njust have yourself being\nable to use Excel.\n\n87\n00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.970\nThis does start from the very\nbeginning in our foundation.\n\n88\n00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.620\nSo it takes our basic information and\ngoes up to,\n\n89\n00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.894\nI would say maybe an intermediate level.\n\n90\n00:05:00.894 --> 00:05:05.748\nAnd this is where I, we talked about in\nsome of our episodes to where people maybe\n\n91\n00:05:05.748 --> 00:05:10.470\nskip over all of the basics of Excel and\nthen go right into the harder stuff.\n\n92\n00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.350\nAnd then when you start kinda\ngetting those problems, you're like,\n\n93\n00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:14.270\nwhy isn't this working?\n\n94\n00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.587\nIt's going back to basics, learning those\nfoundations that can really help you.\n\n95\n00:05:18.587 --> 00:05:21.540\nAnd everyone's like,\nthat's why that does that.\n\n96\n00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.946\nSo we'll be hitting all of that, and\nhopefully you can gain a nice foundational\n\n97\n00:05:25.946 --> 00:05:29.849\nknowledge, even if you actually have\nbeen using Excel for some time.\n\n98\n00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:32.110\nWhat do you need to know\nabout before we get started?\n\n99\n00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.597\nWell, you need to have some familiarity\nwith just the Windows operating system in\n\n100\n00:05:36.597 --> 00:05:37.189\ngeneral.\n\n101\n00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:41.894\nBut you don't have to have any prior\nknowledge of Excel to be able to\n\n102\n00:05:41.894 --> 00:05:44.343\nexcel in this particular series.\n\n103\n00:05:44.343 --> 00:05:49.025\nNow if you have used other Office products\nsuch as Word, or Outlook, or PowerPoint,\n\n104\n00:05:49.025 --> 00:05:52.666\nthen some of those things,\nthey cover all of the Office products,\n\n105\n00:05:52.666 --> 00:05:55.610\nthings like the ribbon and\nthe click access toolbar.\n\n106\n00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.800\nSo you might be very familiar with\nsome of those, but then when you get\n\n107\n00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.910\ninto how does Excel really work, that's\nwhere you're gonna have that difference.\n\n108\n00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.530\nTips and tricks, our little extras.\n\n109\n00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:12.400\nThere's always multiple ways to do the\nsame thing in any of your Office products.\n\n110\n00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.910\nSo while I might show you ways one,\ntwo and three,\n\n111\n00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.920\nthere might be four and five and six.\n\n112\n00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.750\nThere might be other ways to do things\nthat I might not specifically cover\n\n113\n00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:21.790\nin these episodes.\n\n114\n00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.860\nSo, they're out there,\nthey do the same thing.\n\n115\n00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.420\nSo if you have a different way of doing\nit than I do, that's totally fine.\n\n116\n00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.480\nAs long as you can get to that same\nending point then that's good.\n\n117\n00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.570\nUpdates happen, yes they do.\n\n118\n00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:41.260\nAnd depending on if you're on\na Office 365 subscription and\n\n119\n00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.390\nwhen you're updates are scheduled,\n\n120\n00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:48.760\nyou might not have some of the same\nthings that I have because you're for\n\n121\n00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:54.570\na later update than I was on when\nI was filming these episodes.\n\n122\n00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:59.260\nSo do take that into account,\nthat things might look a little different.\n\n123\n00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.985\nAnd then more than just that,\nyou have different versions of Excel.\n\n124\n00:07:02.985 --> 00:07:04.710\nYou're like, different versions?\n\n125\n00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.910\nWhat I mean by that is\nsubscription levels.\n\n126\n00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:08.800\nI have a Enterprise license.\n\n127\n00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.610\nYou might not have\na Enterprise license and\n\n128\n00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.130\nthat might be why I see\na certain button and you don't.\n\n129\n00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:18.970\nYour network, your IT people that are\nsetting up your particular computer and\n\n130\n00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.530\nwhere you're working in\na large organization,\n\n131\n00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:25.660\nthey might have locked certain features\ndown of your Office products or\n\n132\n00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.520\nyour subscriptions that you can't access.\n\n133\n00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.440\nSo you will have that from time\nto time that will make things\n\n134\n00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.280\nlook a little different.\n\n135\n00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.020\nOf course always searching for\nthe answers.\n\n136\n00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.930\nLike why does mine not look like yours.\n\n137\n00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.510\nYou might be able to find that by,\nwell as we say, consulting the oracle and\n\n138\n00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:44.820\ngoing out to Google or Bing or to whatever\nsearch engine you have to go ahead and\n\n139\n00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.250\nget all that information.\n\n140\n00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:49.970\nEverybody uses this product differently.\n\n141\n00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.560\nI might use Excel differently than you,\nand\n\n142\n00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.780\nyou might really need to just\nperform calculations and\n\n143\n00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:00.546\nnot have to worry about changing things\nto be pink and green and different fonts.\n\n144\n00:08:00.546 --> 00:08:04.440\nSo, everybody has different reasons for\nwhy they use Excel.\n\n145\n00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.440\nBut it does have that\nfunctionality that is common,\n\n146\n00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.000\nthat how we decide to use\nthat functionality for\n\n147\n00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.890\nour end result in what you need in\nyour workflow, it could be different.\n\n148\n00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:20.874\nAnd of course, in all these episodes as\nwe like to have fun so, I keep it light.\n\n149\n00:08:20.874 --> 00:08:23.085\nWe're gonna be talking more\nabout Flago and Bishop and\n\n150\n00:08:23.085 --> 00:08:25.200\nwe'll be going through our Christmas Cats.\n\n151\n00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.035\nSo hopefully while learning this,\nthat you have fun as well.\n\n152\n00:08:29.035 --> 00:08:33.502\nAnd hopefully we'll take some of\nthat pain out of knowing Excel and\n\n153\n00:08:33.502 --> 00:08:37.190\nknowing exactly how to do it\nwill make it a lot more fun.\n\n154\n00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:39.150\nSo, I hope you have fun.\n\n155\n00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:43.560\nI will have fun, and\nI hope to see you very soon.\n\n156\n00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:48.310\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:10.156 --> 00:00:14.749\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we are kicking off our series for\n\n4\n00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:16.110\nExcel essentials.\n\n5\n00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.520\nTry to say that three times fast,\n\n6\n00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.000\nit's gonna be a lot of fun through\nout the series I'm sure, and\n\n7\n00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.510\njoining us in the studio to help\nlend her expertise on that topic,\n\n8\n00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.320\nand lead us along the way,\nour good friend Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.480\nVonne, we're glad to have you,\nand how's it going today?\n\n10\n00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.920\n&gt;&gt; It's going fantastic, I'm so\nexcited to start off this Excel essential.\n\n11\n00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.540\n&gt;&gt; Yes hard right?\n\n12\n00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.020\n&gt;&gt; I know I have to really think about,\nslow down it's kind of like when we do\n\n13\n00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.280\nthe file extension for\nExcel which is an exxs.\n\n14\n00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's going to be fun, fun twisty.\n\n15\n00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah every single letter you\nhave to really think about so.\n\n16\n00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.600\n&gt;&gt; Yes we're gonna start at the very\nbeginning and get familiar with Excel.\n\n17\n00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.940\nWhat is Excel, what are we doing we it,\nwhat's our setup,\n\n18\n00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.690\nwhat's your set up, and\nhow are we going to really kinda lay\n\n19\n00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.520\nthe ground work of what exactly\nis this series and what.\n\n20\n00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.150\nSo lets go ahead and start.\n\n21\n00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.860\nI have a PowerPoint presentation,\nI didn't go ahead and\n\n22\n00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.500\nrun the slide show because I had a couple\nof notes that I'd like to keep for\n\n23\n00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.740\nmyself, and for\nyou guys to know what's going on.\n\n24\n00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.445\nSo, what is it when we talk about Excel,\nwe're going to be referring to this\n\n25\n00:01:23.445 --> 00:01:27.629\nas a spreadsheet application\nbecause that's exactly what it is.\n\n26\n00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:31.825\n[LAUGH] It is software, or a program, or\n\n27\n00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:36.877\nan application all three of those words,\nthey all mean the same thing, so\n\n28\n00:01:36.877 --> 00:01:41.917\nExcel is a piece of software that\nis used to create spreadsheets.\n\n29\n00:01:41.917 --> 00:01:46.097\nAnd we will be referring to\nthe Excel files as workbooks.\n\n30\n00:01:46.097 --> 00:01:50.167\nFor example, if we were using Word,\nwe would say that those are documents.\n\n31\n00:01:50.167 --> 00:01:53.900\nIf we were using PowerPoint,\nthey would be presentations.\n\n32\n00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.010\nIn Excel, that is a workbook.\n\n33\n00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.730\nSo when someone says, hey, can you go\nahead and send me that Excel workbook?\n\n34\n00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.830\nOr, hey, can you send me that Excel file?\n\n35\n00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.390\nIt means the same thing.\n\n36\n00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.220\nThat's just what we're\ngoing to be referring to.\n\n37\n00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.510\nThese particular files that\nwe will create in Excel.\n\n38\n00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.820\nSo, what do you use Excel for?\n\n39\n00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.550\nA whole bunch of stuff.\n\n40\n00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.180\nI would think this is probably\none of the most widely\n\n41\n00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.160\nused office applications\nin an office environment.\n\n42\n00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.699\nWords just as popular, maybe Excel too.\n\n43\n00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:28.443\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n44\n00:02:28.443 --> 00:02:30.350\n&gt;&gt; Outlook!\n[LAUGH]\n\n45\n00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.700\n&gt;&gt; Outlooks probably the most popular.\n\n46\n00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.350\nEverybody's gotta have email.\n\n47\n00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.850\nEmail is missing critical.\n\n48\n00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.280\n&gt;&gt; That is true.\n\n49\n00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.990\nBut with all the Gmail's and the Yahoo!'s.\n\n50\n00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.770\n&gt;&gt; True.\n&gt;&gt; I actually looked this up.\n\n51\n00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.740\n&gt;&gt; You did?\n&gt;&gt; What's the most popular Office product?\n\n52\n00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.770\nAnd there was all conflicting results.\n\n53\n00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.730\nIt was either Word or Excel.\n\n54\n00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.770\nThey did say Outlook,\nbecause of the emailing part of it.\n\n55\n00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.070\nBut it seems like everybody\nwants to use Excel.\n\n56\n00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.340\nAnd I think it's one of\nthose like some Offices-\n\n57\n00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.282\n&gt;&gt; Not everybody, Von.\n\n58\n00:03:01.282 --> 00:03:03.716\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They would like you and\n\n59\n00:03:03.716 --> 00:03:05.762\nthey kinda force Excel upon you.\n\n60\n00:03:05.762 --> 00:03:08.250\nBut we're gonna put\neverything in spreadsheets.\n\n61\n00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.665\nAnd they're like I don't\nwanna use this product.\n\n62\n00:03:10.665 --> 00:03:12.700\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And when you say the word spreadsheet,\n\n63\n00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.550\nI think of sitting on my\nbed with papers everywhere.\n\n64\n00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.480\nI mean my eyes,\n\n65\n00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.060\ngoes here and I kind of feel that way\nwhen I've used Excel in the past.\n\n66\n00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.190\nIt can be a bit daunting.\n\n67\n00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.243\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and a little wonky too, right?\n\n68\n00:03:27.243 --> 00:03:32.150\n[LAUGH] And it doesn't behave,\nlike with Word okay you type\n\n69\n00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.380\nout words on a page and\nyou can make it pretty and you hit enter.\n\n70\n00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.850\nI think with the spreadsheet\napplication it is a different beast,\n\n71\n00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.450\nit behaves differently so\nI think that's where it throws people off.\n\n72\n00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.850\nYou know with outlook okay new message,\nsend,\n\n73\n00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.410\nreceive, it's maybe a little\nbit more intuitive.\n\n74\n00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.850\nI think with this product if you're not\nfamiliar with using this type of program\n\n75\n00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.080\nIt does get a little weird.\n\n76\n00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.530\nSo what do you use it for?\n\n77\n00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.340\nTo arrange and analyze data.\n\n78\n00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.620\nWell, okay, we have mailing lists,\nso we need to go ahead and\n\n79\n00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.550\nstore everybody's addresses.\n\n80\n00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.660\nWell, Excel would be a perfect\nplace to do it because\n\n81\n00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.850\nyou can use your Excel\nspreadsheets in a tabular format.\n\n82\n00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.420\nYou have it arrange in columns.\n\n83\n00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.580\nAnd rows, and that's where you go\nahead and store your information.\n\n84\n00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.360\nAnd so that's why a lot of people use\nthis, because they want to be able to\n\n85\n00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.550\nstore that type of data in\nsome type of organized format.\n\n86\n00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.270\nSo the other thing that Excel is really\ngood for is calculations and functions.\n\n87\n00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.810\nI wan to go ahead and\ntotal up all my weekly sales.\n\n88\n00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.110\nDon't wanna do it on a calculator, you go\nahead and write different formulas and or\n\n89\n00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.240\nfunctions, they're pretty\nmuch the same thing, and\n\n90\n00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.360\nyou perform calculations in Excel, and\nthere's a lot of different things that\n\n91\n00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.600\nyou can do within Excel when it\ncomes to crunching those numbers.\n\n92\n00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.760\nSo that's where people like to use excel\nand you can see of tracking data within\n\n93\n00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.280\nan organization where excel's going\nbe extremely useful and powerful.\n\n94\n00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.915\nAnd so that's why people\nPeople go ahead and use it.\n\n95\n00:05:05.915 --> 00:05:10.489\nNow, in this series, just to kinda\nclarify, this particular series is not\n\n96\n00:05:10.489 --> 00:05:14.848\ngoing to touch anything about\ncalculations, because calculations and\n\n97\n00:05:14.848 --> 00:05:19.575\nfunctions within in Excel is so robust and\nit's such a main part of Excel.\n\n98\n00:05:19.575 --> 00:05:24.095\nI determined that we are gonna break\nthat up into an entirely different show.\n\n99\n00:05:24.095 --> 00:05:28.485\nThis show is just concentrated on the\nfundamentals, getting and starting Excel.\n\n100\n00:05:28.485 --> 00:05:32.285\nAnd not thinking about\nadding up things okay.\n\n101\n00:05:32.285 --> 00:05:34.815\nLet's just get our organization,\nget our data in there.\n\n102\n00:05:34.815 --> 00:05:36.385\nAnd know how to work it.\n\n103\n00:05:36.385 --> 00:05:41.480\nSo just kinda clarifying\nthe scope of this particular show.\n\n104\n00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.800\n&gt;&gt; Don't want the good people out there\nto feel like they're drinking from\n\n105\n00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.770\na firehose, right?\n\n106\n00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:46.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly.\n\n107\n00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.810\nAnd I think as we go through,\n\n108\n00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.740\ncuz I know you've expressed it like,\nI'm not really an Excel person.\n\n109\n00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.130\nWell that's perfect, I'm so\nglad you're going to be hosting with me.\n\n110\n00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.540\n&gt;&gt; You remember that scene from Ace\nVentura Two and he's afraid of the bat and\n\n111\n00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.000\nthey put it in his face.\n\n112\n00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.655\nGet it away.\n\n113\n00:06:01.655 --> 00:06:03.745\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's how I feel about Excel.\n\n114\n00:06:03.745 --> 00:06:06.330\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, well hopefully along the way,\n\n115\n00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.503\nthat you might make some discoveries like,\nhey, that's not so bad, I could do that.\n\n116\n00:06:10.503 --> 00:06:11.067\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I hear-\n\n117\n00:06:11.067 --> 00:06:11.570\n&gt;&gt; We'll see.\n\n118\n00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:12.076\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n119\n00:06:12.076 --> 00:06:13.516\n&gt;&gt; You've got your work cut out for\n\n120\n00:06:13.516 --> 00:06:15.115\nyou, I'll tell you that.\n[LAUGH]\n\n121\n00:06:15.115 --> 00:06:15.682\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n122\n00:06:15.682 --> 00:06:18.666\nI am here to hopefully demystify.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n123\n00:06:18.666 --> 00:06:20.156\n&gt;&gt; This particular program for you.\n\n124\n00:06:20.156 --> 00:06:21.329\nSo that being said,\n\n125\n00:06:21.329 --> 00:06:25.952\nthe other thing about Excel, and we've\nkind of talked about this off to the side\n\n126\n00:06:25.952 --> 00:06:30.510\nhere and then we'll probably be talking\nabout this throughout the episodes,\n\n127\n00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:35.066\nis that I think people try to use Excel\nthat it's not supposed to be used for.\n\n128\n00:06:35.066 --> 00:06:37.790\nWe talk a lot about databases and\n\n129\n00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.370\nExcel is not a database program.\n\n130\n00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:44.900\nEven though a lot of people\nuse Excel like a database and\n\n131\n00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.960\npeople think, well, a database is\njust a place where you store data.\n\n132\n00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.030\n&gt;&gt; Walks like a duck and talks like\na duck, it must be a duck, right?\n\n133\n00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:52.705\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it kind of is a duck.\n\n134\n00:06:52.705 --> 00:06:53.770\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n135\n00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.510\n&gt;&gt; It's but, it's like a-\n&gt;&gt; It's like a goose that dressed up\n\n136\n00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:57.489\nlike a duck-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n137\n00:06:57.489 --> 00:06:58.112\n&gt;&gt; And said I'm a duck.\n\n138\n00:06:58.112 --> 00:07:01.090\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I had this picture of a hen\n\n139\n00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:02.830\nthat's got a little hat on and it's like-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n140\n00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.530\nYeah and he's like hey guys yes.\n\n141\n00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:05.975\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; How's it going?\n\n142\n00:07:05.975 --> 00:07:08.478\nAnd they're like you're\na strange looking fellow.\n\n143\n00:07:08.478 --> 00:07:09.073\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You are an odd bird.\n\n144\n00:07:09.073 --> 00:07:09.795\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n145\n00:07:09.795 --> 00:07:15.145\nSo it can perform a lot of\nthings that a database can do.\n\n146\n00:07:15.145 --> 00:07:18.522\nAnd actually,\nwhen we talking about functions,\n\n147\n00:07:18.522 --> 00:07:21.342\nthere are a whole set of\ndatabase functions and\n\n148\n00:07:21.342 --> 00:07:25.642\ncalculations that you can perform on that,\nbut there is a limitation.\n\n149\n00:07:25.642 --> 00:07:29.482\nIf you are going to be storing a lot of\nstuff, you might need to go up one level.\n\n150\n00:07:29.482 --> 00:07:33.616\nAnd then the other thing is,\nExcel is used to store data.\n\n151\n00:07:33.616 --> 00:07:36.586\nSo you probably wouldn't\nwant to create invitations.\n\n152\n00:07:36.586 --> 00:07:38.526\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; You know, to a party in Excel.\n\n153\n00:07:38.526 --> 00:07:39.721\nI have had people's, like.\n\n154\n00:07:39.721 --> 00:07:42.016\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Like, I get a printout, I'm like!\n\n155\n00:07:42.016 --> 00:07:43.026\nThey're like, I did this in Excel!\n\n156\n00:07:43.026 --> 00:07:45.391\nI'm like, how did you make that happen,\nyou know?\n\n157\n00:07:45.391 --> 00:07:46.982\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, it's very interesting.\n\n158\n00:07:46.982 --> 00:07:50.081\nSo, try to keep Excel in the Excel box,\nbut\n\n159\n00:07:50.081 --> 00:07:53.973\nit can kind of move around\nin some other places there.\n\n160\n00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:57.201\nSo just wanted to throw that out there.\n\n161\n00:07:57.201 --> 00:08:01.462\nNow this slide that I have here,\nI've already kind of mentioned this,\n\n162\n00:08:01.462 --> 00:08:06.150\nis a spreadsheet application is going\nto be composed of columns and rows.\n\n163\n00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.530\nAnd where those rows and\ncolumns intersect would be a cell.\n\n164\n00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:12.990\nSo everything that we're going to\nbe talking about in Excel will\n\n165\n00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:14.790\nhave a cell reference.\n\n166\n00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:16.610\nFor example, in this slide right here,\n\n167\n00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:20.920\nyou could see that my active\ncell is going to be cell B3.\n\n168\n00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:21.900\nWhat is an active cell?\n\n169\n00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:26.390\nIs that green box that's around\nthat particular box or cell.\n\n170\n00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:30.099\nAnd then you can see the column\nheadings and the row headings,\n\n171\n00:08:30.099 --> 00:08:33.960\nthey are highlighted to be able\nto let you know where you're at.\n\n172\n00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:38.737\nSo we'll be talking a lot about\nnavigating our Excel spreadsheets in some\n\n173\n00:08:38.737 --> 00:08:42.060\nof our other episodes, so\ndefinitely stay tuned.\n\n174\n00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:45.750\nNow where is Excel within\nthe Office 365 suite?\n\n175\n00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:50.080\nYes, this is where you buy\na subscription to Office 365, and\n\n176\n00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.000\nyou will get a variety\nof different products.\n\n177\n00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.250\nNow this is a slide that just has\na whole bunch of them on there.\n\n178\n00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:59.050\nAnd maybe things like InfoPath and\nPublisher,\n\n179\n00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:01.330\nmaybe those are products that\nyou're not as familiar with.\n\n180\n00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:06.150\nAnd maybe you get a subscription that\ndoesn't even have that within what\n\n181\n00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.686\nyou're buying, but it is part of it.\n\n182\n00:09:08.686 --> 00:09:11.828\nAnd you can see the column over\nhere on the left, like Word, Excel,\n\n183\n00:09:11.828 --> 00:09:13.260\nOutlook, PowerPoint.\n\n184\n00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.850\nThose are going to be your\nmain core Office products.\n\n185\n00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:21.080\nI did throw Access into there,\nthat would be your database program.\n\n186\n00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.010\nNow with databases,\n\n187\n00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:25.055\nyou also have this whole other thing\ncalled a relational database design.\n\n188\n00:09:25.055 --> 00:09:28.180\nUnderstanding if you're\ngoing to build a database,\n\n189\n00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:31.800\nyou need to understand the relation\nof the data to each other.\n\n190\n00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.910\nAnd if you don't set that up right,\nit's gonna not really work so well.\n\n191\n00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:39.480\nThat's a whole other product, but\nI just wanna throw that out there.\n\n192\n00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.540\nSo where is it within the Office suite?\n\n193\n00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.090\nNow of course,\nyou do have different product plans and\n\n194\n00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:48.460\nsubscriptions that you can purchase\nthrough Office for Office 365.\n\n195\n00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:52.560\nAnd this is where you can have it for\nhome, business,\n\n196\n00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.082\neducation there's also different tiers.\n\n197\n00:09:55.082 --> 00:09:59.410\nYou have small business plans and\nenterprise licenses, and so\n\n198\n00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:03.860\nthere's a lot of different variations\non how you can purchase this product\n\n199\n00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.680\nthrough an Office 365 subscription.\n\n200\n00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:12.930\nBut of course, you don't have to buy a\nsubscription to Office 365 to have Excel.\n\n201\n00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:17.765\nYou can have it to where you buy a single\nlicense that doesn't have any of\n\n202\n00:10:17.765 --> 00:10:23.650\nthe updates, and it's not part of this\nkinda connected Office 365 subscription,\n\n203\n00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:25.600\nand you can still use Excel.\n\n204\n00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.030\n&gt;&gt; So it's like a la carte.\n\n205\n00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.316\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, and that's, of course,\n\n206\n00:10:29.316 --> 00:10:34.103\nthe way that all of these products were\nsold for the longest time before they went\n\n207\n00:10:34.103 --> 00:10:38.191\nto this subscription model that\na lot of your software's going to.\n\n208\n00:10:38.191 --> 00:10:42.844\nAnd of course, the benefits of having a\nsubscription is that any time there's even\n\n209\n00:10:42.844 --> 00:10:47.496\na small little change, little incremental\nupdate, that gets pushed out to you and\n\n210\n00:10:47.496 --> 00:10:52.000\nyou go ahead and be able to enjoy\nall the benefits of those updates.\n\n211\n00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.342\nFor example,\nback in the day when you bought Office, or\n\n212\n00:10:55.342 --> 00:10:58.057\nwe'll just go with Excel, Excel 2003.\n\n213\n00:10:58.057 --> 00:11:01.140\nThe next version wasn't until Excel 2007.\n\n214\n00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:05.637\nSo you had to wait that whole amount of\ntime before you could purchase the next\n\n215\n00:11:05.637 --> 00:11:07.264\nversion of that software.\n\n216\n00:11:07.264 --> 00:11:10.305\nAnd then you work with that,\nand then you have to wait for\n\n217\n00:11:10.305 --> 00:11:14.790\nthem to release another iteration of that\nproduct to be able to get new features.\n\n218\n00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:19.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now as the new features\nare created, it's rolled out immediately.\n\n219\n00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.720\nSo one day you're logging into Excel and\nOffice 365 and\n\n220\n00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.330\nit looks one way,\nthe next day you've got a new button.\n\n221\n00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:26.985\nIt's like ooh, what does that button do?\n\n222\n00:11:26.985 --> 00:11:32.190\nWhere before, people got entrenched\ninto this is how Excel works, and\n\n223\n00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:33.510\nnow they come up with\na completely new version.\n\n224\n00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:36.080\nEverything's moved, it's changed,\nit's done this, it's that, and\n\n225\n00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.530\nit's really hard to help\npeople keep moving on.\n\n226\n00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:40.087\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and speaking of updates,\n\n227\n00:11:40.087 --> 00:11:42.599\nwe have a slide towards\nthe end that talks about this.\n\n228\n00:11:42.599 --> 00:11:46.259\nThis happens to me throughout when\nI'm doing these series, like Word,\n\n229\n00:11:46.259 --> 00:11:47.054\nyou remember?\n\n230\n00:11:47.054 --> 00:11:47.935\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; I think you were my\n\n231\n00:11:47.935 --> 00:11:51.595\nhost where it's like okay, they put out an\nupdate, and now it's completely different.\n\n232\n00:11:51.595 --> 00:11:54.845\nI have this whole new button, and it's\nchanged something of the way it behaves.\n\n233\n00:11:54.845 --> 00:11:58.076\nI was like, that's great, right in\nthe middle of while I'm filming this show.\n\n234\n00:11:58.076 --> 00:11:59.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's a little difficult.\n\n235\n00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.465\nSo just kinda knowing that it's a great\nthing, but it can also be one of those\n\n236\n00:12:03.465 --> 00:12:06.546\nlike all right, well,\nnow I gotta go re-record that other one,\n\n237\n00:12:06.546 --> 00:12:09.820\n[LAUGH] cuz I have a whole new thing\nthat I need to talk to you guys about.\n\n238\n00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:11.503\n&gt;&gt; The old philosophers used to say,\n\n239\n00:12:11.503 --> 00:12:14.007\nyou never step into the same\nriver twice with this.\n\n240\n00:12:14.007 --> 00:12:16.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] exactly, so.\n\n241\n00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:21.634\nSo talking about that,\nwell` do you have Office 365, or\n\n242\n00:12:21.634 --> 00:12:25.030\ndo you have a single license or\na purchase?\n\n243\n00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:27.570\nMaybe, do they even make\nthem on CDs anymore?\n\n244\n00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:31.415\nI haven't had a CD drive forever,\nso [LAUGH] I have no idea.\n\n245\n00:12:31.415 --> 00:12:37.225\nSo you can see that the thing that you do\nbecome aware of in this particular show,\n\n246\n00:12:37.225 --> 00:12:41.840\nthis is where we have Excel\nlocally installed on our computer.\n\n247\n00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:48.924\nSo we have downloaded the software,\ninstalled it on our computer,\n\n248\n00:12:48.924 --> 00:12:56.196\nand I do not go online to access Excel, so\nI just have it right here on the computer.\n\n249\n00:12:56.196 --> 00:12:58.646\nI can just see it right there,\ncuz I pinned it to my taskbar.\n\n250\n00:12:58.646 --> 00:13:01.610\nAnd so that's what we're going to be\nworking with, and the local version or\n\n251\n00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:04.876\nthe locally installed version of any\nof your Office products, you know what?\n\n252\n00:13:04.876 --> 00:13:06.261\nI just realized it says Word.\n\n253\n00:13:06.261 --> 00:13:06.913\n&gt;&gt; It does say Word.\n\n254\n00:13:06.913 --> 00:13:07.644\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n255\n00:13:07.644 --> 00:13:10.030\nOkay, why don't we go ahead and on the\nfly, let's go ahead and make this [LAUGH].\n\n256\n00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:10.631\n&gt;&gt; You didn't see that.\n\n257\n00:13:10.631 --> 00:13:12.919\nPay no attention to the man\nbehind the curtain [LAUGH].\n\n258\n00:13:12.919 --> 00:13:15.170\n&gt;&gt; Probably should have done a find and\nreplace on this.\n\n259\n00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.100\nBecause if you've watched\nany of my other shows-.\n\n260\n00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.707\n&gt;&gt; Word Online is also free, apparently.\n\n261\n00:13:18.707 --> 00:13:20.490\n&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you, there's another one.\n\n262\n00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:24.830\nSee this is a teachable moment\nto use find and replace.\n\n263\n00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:27.530\nFind all instances of Word and\nchange it to Excel,\n\n264\n00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:29.820\nbecause this is the same PowerPoint.\n\n265\n00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:32.148\nI started with Word, and just changed\nit all out, changed the colors and\n\n266\n00:13:32.148 --> 00:13:32.847\nall that good stuff.\n\n267\n00:13:32.847 --> 00:13:35.032\nSo, if this looks familiar,\nyeah, I do it for\n\n268\n00:13:35.032 --> 00:13:35.915\nevery-\n&gt;&gt; That's cuz it is.\n\n269\n00:13:35.915 --> 00:13:40.408\n&gt;&gt; I do it for every one of the Office\nproducts in my different series, so\n\n270\n00:13:40.408 --> 00:13:41.656\nthere we go [LAUGH].\n\n271\n00:13:41.656 --> 00:13:46.220\nBut we will be using a locally\ninstalled version of this product.\n\n272\n00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:50.856\nAnd most of the features, so that's\nwhere if you're watching the series and\n\n273\n00:13:50.856 --> 00:13:54.866\nyou only have access to Excel online,\nit won't be the exact same.\n\n274\n00:13:54.866 --> 00:13:57.020\nIt actually just happened today\nwith one of the switchers.\n\n275\n00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:00.267\nThey were like, I was showing them\nsomething about filtering things in\n\n276\n00:14:00.267 --> 00:14:03.515\na table, which you'll learn about in,\nmaybe not this particular series,\n\n277\n00:14:03.515 --> 00:14:04.804\nbut maybe the next one [LAUGH].\n\n278\n00:14:04.804 --> 00:14:06.518\nAnd I'm like, yeah,\nyou can filter by color.\n\n279\n00:14:06.518 --> 00:14:09.611\nI'm like, you're on the online version.\n\n280\n00:14:09.611 --> 00:14:13.945\nOkay, well, in the locally installed\nversion, yeah, you can filter by color, so\n\n281\n00:14:13.945 --> 00:14:15.420\nit's those little things.\n\n282\n00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.890\nYou'll probably get most of it,\nbut not all of it.\n\n283\n00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:19.720\nAll right, next slide.\n\n284\n00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.206\nVersions and file types, yay!\n\n285\n00:14:21.206 --> 00:14:25.726\nAll right, I kind of mentioned\nthe whole going from 2003 to 2007 to\n\n286\n00:14:25.726 --> 00:14:30.410\nwhere you had that was the only way\nthat you could purchase the software.\n\n287\n00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:33.941\nWell, now you can see different versions,\nand I'm always fascinated by icons.\n\n288\n00:14:33.941 --> 00:14:38.172\nAnd since I do graphic design, you can see\nthe iterations of all the different icons\n\n289\n00:14:38.172 --> 00:14:40.242\nthat you've had throughout the years.\n\n290\n00:14:40.242 --> 00:14:43.472\nAnd so\nwe're going to be working with files,\n\n291\n00:14:43.472 --> 00:14:48.670\nwhen you save an Excel file, you'll\nbe saving it as an xlsx file format.\n\n292\n00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:53.303\nAnd you can see that they started using\nthis file format back in 2007, and\n\n293\n00:14:53.303 --> 00:14:55.380\nnow all the way up until 2017.\n\n294\n00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:57.670\nSo for the last ten years,\nthey've been using this.\n\n295\n00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:03.000\nThat X on the end is just in an XML\nbase type, if you want to say that,\n\n296\n00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.460\njust expanded the functionality of\nthe files in all of your Office products.\n\n297\n00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:14.540\nDoc versus docx, ppt versus pptx for\nour different file types here.\n\n298\n00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:20.000\nSo if you get an xls file,\nthat's where it is\n\n299\n00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.230\ncreated back into that\nparticular version that 2003 and\n\n300\n00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:29.570\nthen older would be able to\nread that particular file type.\n\n301\n00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:34.820\nSo they are separate file types,\nand so if you ever needed to have\n\n302\n00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:41.440\nthat compatibility to be able to save\nthis down into that xls file format,\n\n303\n00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.800\nthen you just need to make sure you\nunderstand that there is a difference and\n\n304\n00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.110\nyou do a File &gt; Save As\nto be able to do that.\n\n305\n00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:50.869\nAnd we do that throughout the episodes to\njust kind of reiterate that particular\n\n306\n00:15:50.869 --> 00:15:51.383\nconcept.\n\n307\n00:15:51.383 --> 00:15:54.750\nI like to go ahead and throw that out\nright here in this particular slide.\n\n308\n00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:58.181\nThere's another thing that\nI had in my show notes.\n\n309\n00:15:58.181 --> 00:16:01.542\nI'm always fascinated history,\nwhere'd this come from.\n\n310\n00:16:01.542 --> 00:16:03.670\nDo you remember Lotus 1, 2, 3?\n\n311\n00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:05.080\n&gt;&gt; I do.\nI never used it, but\n\n312\n00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.545\nI remember it being out and\nit being taught a lot.\n\n313\n00:16:08.545 --> 00:16:10.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I never used it either, but\n\n314\n00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:13.680\nI do know that that was the-\n&gt;&gt; Lotus Notes or whatever it was?\n\n315\n00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:17.387\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, then Notes was like the Word,\nand you had a whole Lotus functionality.\n\n316\n00:16:17.387 --> 00:16:18.243\n&gt;&gt; Suite?\nYeah.\n\n317\n00:16:18.243 --> 00:16:20.139\n&gt;&gt; Was that the whole Domino Server thing?\n\n318\n00:16:20.139 --> 00:16:24.260\n&gt;&gt; Domino was like a web, or no, I'm\nsorry, not a web server, an email server.\n\n319\n00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:25.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, was it-\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if it was,\n\n320\n00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:27.010\nI want to say yes.\n\n321\n00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:28.940\n&gt;&gt; Was it connected to Lotus?\n\n322\n00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.750\n&gt;&gt; It feels like it is, I can't remember.\n\n323\n00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:32.170\nIt's been years.\n\n324\n00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:33.871\nWhen I say years, I mean over ten [LAUGH].\n\n325\n00:16:33.871 --> 00:16:37.475\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and since we all know each other\nfrom long ago when we would teach this,\n\n326\n00:16:37.475 --> 00:16:40.192\nand that was like,\nit's always one of those like, well,\n\n327\n00:16:40.192 --> 00:16:42.710\nat least I don't have to build\na Domino Server [LAUGH].\n\n328\n00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:46.670\nCuz that was like anybody teaching\nthe administrative part of that, the techy\n\n329\n00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:49.140\nside stuff, they're like that was just-\n&gt;&gt; It was a nightmare.\n\n330\n00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:52.609\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I feel like it had\nsomething to do with Lotus.\n\n331\n00:16:52.609 --> 00:16:55.505\nI don't know,\ndon't quote us on that one [LAUGH].\n\n332\n00:16:55.505 --> 00:16:58.115\nBut just kinda going back\nto where it kinda came.\n\n333\n00:16:58.115 --> 00:17:02.826\nIt originally marketed from a multiplan in\n1982 and just talking about the MS-DOS.\n\n334\n00:17:02.826 --> 00:17:08.325\nI also thought it was interesting that it\nwas first released on Macintosh machines.\n\n335\n00:17:08.325 --> 00:17:10.257\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; Back in 1985, and\n\n336\n00:17:10.257 --> 00:17:14.890\nthe first Windows version was in\nNovember of 87, so one of those-\n\n337\n00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:16.140\n&gt;&gt; That is funny.\n\n338\n00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.260\n&gt;&gt; Right?\nI found that fascinating.\n\n339\n00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:22.572\nI'm like, wow, this came out for\nMac first, and then Windows, so.\n\n340\n00:17:22.572 --> 00:17:25.680\nNow this is from Wikipedia, so\nI have the article in here.\n\n341\n00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:29.990\nAnd then everyone's like, you should\nalways check your facts in Wikipedia.\n\n342\n00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:34.313\nBut hey, even if it's half true, I thought\nthat was pretty interesting [LAUGH].\n\n343\n00:17:34.313 --> 00:17:36.140\nSo that's were it kinda came from.\n\n344\n00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.178\n&gt;&gt; Well they have cited a source there,\nso you could follow that.\n\n345\n00:17:38.178 --> 00:17:40.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I probably shoulda\nput that one in there, too.\n\n346\n00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:42.201\nBut hey, I got the website in there, so.\n\n347\n00:17:42.201 --> 00:17:42.828\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n348\n00:17:42.828 --> 00:17:45.825\n&gt;&gt; But yeah,\njust kinda knowing were this came from,\n\n349\n00:17:45.825 --> 00:17:48.970\ncuz people used to use\nspreadsheets on pen and paper.\n\n350\n00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:54.340\n&gt;&gt; That's why I think of sitting on\na bed with sheets, actual spreadsheets,\n\n351\n00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:57.610\nspread out all over the place and\nyou try and remember what goes where.\n\n352\n00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:59.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just thought that was funny so\nI was like, yeah,\n\n353\n00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:01.250\nthat's exactly where we come from.\n\n354\n00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:05.560\nSo history, here we go, and\nnow we have an electronic workbooks,\n\n355\n00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.745\nwhich are composed of worksheets.\n\n356\n00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.620\nNow file types, let's come back over\nhere so I can use my down arrow.\n\n357\n00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:14.741\nAnd whoops there, let's go ahead and\nbring our notes down.\n\n358\n00:18:14.741 --> 00:18:19.310\nAnd here, showing extensions,\nthat whole what type of file do I have.\n\n359\n00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:23.199\nI'm a big fan of this,\nbeing able to see it.\n\n360\n00:18:23.199 --> 00:18:25.947\nBecause if you see your\nlittle list right here,\n\n361\n00:18:25.947 --> 00:18:31.270\nif you do not have file extensions shown,\nyou're just seeing it as the file name.\n\n362\n00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:34.680\nAs opposed to,\nif I have the file extensions turned on,\n\n363\n00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:39.000\nI can tell the difference of hey,\nthis is a CSV, file this is an XLSX file.\n\n364\n00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:45.325\nThis is an old version, and\nthis is a DOC, or DOCX.\n\n365\n00:18:45.325 --> 00:18:50.401\nSo I love to show extensions, and I always\nlike to tell people about how to do that,\n\n366\n00:18:50.401 --> 00:18:53.410\nand so this is what this slide's about.\n\n367\n00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:58.510\nNow in your File Explorer, just when\nyou go down here to viewing your files,\n\n368\n00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:03.800\nyou can use that ribbon up on\nthe top there that there are check\n\n369\n00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:09.365\nboxes off the right hand side where\nyou can show file name extensions.\n\n370\n00:19:09.365 --> 00:19:13.800\nNow the thing is, when you start doing\nthis, I like it, but do be very careful,\n\n371\n00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:17.067\nand I have this in my notes,\ncareful when renaming files.\n\n372\n00:19:17.067 --> 00:19:19.675\nDo not remove or delete extensions or\n\n373\n00:19:19.675 --> 00:19:23.382\nanything past that period for\nthat file extension.\n\n374\n00:19:23.382 --> 00:19:30.220\nBecause file extensions tell your computer\nhey, this is what program to open this in.\n\n375\n00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:33.350\nSo if you change that,\nit can get kind of messed up.\n\n376\n00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:37.230\n&gt;&gt; It gets real fun, especially for\nthe people that you call.\n\n377\n00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:40.213\nThat would be me, and I'm like,huh.\n\n378\n00:19:40.213 --> 00:19:44.350\nIs it suppose to open with Adobe Acrobat\nand look all jumbled like this?\n\n379\n00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:45.280\nNo, that's why I called you.\n\n380\n00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.031\nWhat does it normally open with?\n\n381\n00:19:46.031 --> 00:19:46.970\nI don't know.\n\n382\n00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:50.876\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Those are-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Great, neither do I [LAUGH].\n\n383\n00:19:50.876 --> 00:19:52.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's where it's like,\nlook at the icon.\n\n384\n00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.840\nWhat color is the icon?\n\n385\n00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.600\nThat was one of like somebody that\nworked at a help desk would always ask.\n\n386\n00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:01.470\nThey would always say like,\nwhat does the color, what's the icon?\n\n387\n00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:03.260\nOkay, well that's a whole\nother [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH].\n\n388\n00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.362\nBut yeah, the green and then that way,\n\n389\n00:20:05.362 --> 00:20:08.250\nit understands it needs to\nbe associated with Excel.\n\n390\n00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:12.712\nAnd so that's where changing that file\ntype when you rename it can cause some\n\n391\n00:20:12.712 --> 00:20:13.416\nproblems.\n\n392\n00:20:13.416 --> 00:20:18.990\nSo don't do anything past that dot,\nif you have file extensions.\n\n393\n00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:19.960\nAnd that's where sometimes,\npeople just don't even turn them on.\n\n394\n00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nWindows by default hides files extension.\n\n395\n00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:25.734\nSo you would've had to have turned\nthat on to be able to chop that off.\n\n396\n00:20:25.734 --> 00:20:32.328\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah, so I like it, but\njust keeping it as don't do this.\n\n397\n00:20:32.328 --> 00:20:36.576\nBut some people, it's like, let's just not\neven, let's just avoid that all together,\n\n398\n00:20:36.576 --> 00:20:38.030\nlet's just not turn on [LAUGH].\n\n399\n00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:39.900\nAll right, let's see,\nwhat else do I have going on here?\n\n400\n00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:41.500\nAll right, so we're almost done.\n\n401\n00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:47.157\nOur setup, to let you guys know what I am\ngoing to be teaching this series from,\n\n402\n00:20:47.157 --> 00:20:50.176\nI have an Office 365 Pro Plus account.\n\n403\n00:20:50.176 --> 00:20:56.160\nIt is going to be locally installed on\na Windows 10 Pro 64-bit operating system.\n\n404\n00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:00.824\nDo take note that I am teaching from\na virtual machine on a Macintosh computer,\n\n405\n00:21:00.824 --> 00:21:02.882\nso I have both operating systems.\n\n406\n00:21:02.882 --> 00:21:04.428\nSometimes, virtual machines,\n\n407\n00:21:04.428 --> 00:21:08.172\nanything in a virtual machine can get\na little weird every once in a while.\n\n408\n00:21:08.172 --> 00:21:11.350\nAnd it's one of those like,\nit's supposed to work like this, but\n\n409\n00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:16.448\nI think because of this environment,\nit can throw that off a little bit.\n\n410\n00:21:16.448 --> 00:21:22.290\nNow your setup, how do you know\nwhat type of account that you have?\n\n411\n00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:27.630\nHow did I know I have an Office\n365 Pro Plus account?\n\n412\n00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:31.324\nBecause any of your programs,\nnow this can be Excel, what is this?\n\n413\n00:21:31.324 --> 00:21:33.012\nPowerpoint [LAUGH], Word, or any of them.\n\n414\n00:21:33.012 --> 00:21:36.796\nIf you go to your File and\ngo to Account, it will tell you.\n\n415\n00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:37.640\nHere, I'll actually show you.\n\n416\n00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:41.710\nIf I go to File, and I go to Account,\nyou can see right over here that\n\n417\n00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:47.000\nthis is the particular version of\nOffice that I have in my subscription.\n\n418\n00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.270\nThere is also something in here that you\nshould probably notice that this version,\n\n419\n00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:54.050\nthis build number,\nthat makes a big difference.\n\n420\n00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:55.930\nAnd right now I'm on a current channel.\n\n421\n00:21:55.930 --> 00:22:01.340\nAnd that's what it means by\nhow my updates are treated.\n\n422\n00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:05.890\nThere is a current, there's like,\nI have a PDF that'll let you know.\n\n423\n00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:07.900\nBut there are two ways that\nyou can get your updates.\n\n424\n00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:11.380\nIt's like every month or\nevery four months.\n\n425\n00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:14.930\nI can't remember the specific names,\nbut you'll see in just a second.\n\n426\n00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:17.140\nSo I have it to where it\nupdates every month, and\n\n427\n00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:20.380\nthat's why I might be in the middle of\na series and they throw out an update.\n\n428\n00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:23.940\nMy build number changes, and\nthen It throws me off a little bit.\n\n429\n00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:28.929\nLike I said, it can kind of mess you up\na little bit, and so watch your build\n\n430\n00:22:28.929 --> 00:22:34.584\nnumbers and see I bet you that's why\nyours looks a little different than mine.\n\n431\n00:22:34.584 --> 00:22:39.770\nOr the other thing that can come into\nplay is that subscription versions.\n\n432\n00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:42.770\nLike I said,\nwe're on an enterprise license.\n\n433\n00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:44.860\nAnd an enterprise license,\nI think we're on an E5.\n\n434\n00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:46.750\nI think we're the highest\nlevel that we can do,\n\n435\n00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:49.057\ncuz we have to teach all this stuff.\n\n436\n00:22:49.057 --> 00:22:53.260\nOn the admin stuff, like Ronnie teaches\nOffice 365 for the techy people.\n\n437\n00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:57.560\nI probably have different\nthings available to me\n\n438\n00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:02.465\nthan somebody that has a personal\nhome version of Excel.\n\n439\n00:23:02.465 --> 00:23:03.790\nNow you're like, well,\nis it that different?\n\n440\n00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:05.290\nIt's gonna be slight.\n\n441\n00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:09.755\nBut I mean, I've even had occurrences\nwhere we're all on Office 365 here, but my\n\n442\n00:23:09.755 --> 00:23:14.169\ncoworker who is not on an E5 subscription,\nhe doesn't have the same options as me.\n\n443\n00:23:14.169 --> 00:23:16.417\nI'm like, how do you not, what?\n\n444\n00:23:16.417 --> 00:23:19.821\nThe only thing that I can\nhypothesize is that it's gotta\n\n445\n00:23:19.821 --> 00:23:22.510\nbe that I'm on an enterprise and he's not.\n\n446\n00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.313\nAnd it’s one of those I'm just\ngoing to go with that [LAUGH].\n\n447\n00:23:25.313 --> 00:23:27.656\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sounds good, [LAUGH] right?\n\n448\n00:23:27.656 --> 00:23:30.140\n&gt;&gt; There’s so many different\nflavors of these things, and\n\n449\n00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:31.850\nit’s those little, those parts.\n\n450\n00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:35.230\nAnd if you, I'll sit there and\nfor hours search the oracle,\n\n451\n00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:37.600\nthe Internet and why is this,\nand here’s my build number.\n\n452\n00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.713\nAnd it’s so\nnew there’s no documentation on it, so\n\n453\n00:23:40.713 --> 00:23:43.205\nthat's something that it could happen.\n\n454\n00:23:43.205 --> 00:23:45.961\nNot always, but\njust throwing that out there.\n\n455\n00:23:45.961 --> 00:23:51.883\nAnd so, if you have an older version,\nif you are on 2013, it shouldn't make,\n\n456\n00:23:51.883 --> 00:23:57.652\nthose, between 2013 and 16, 17,\nThere's not a massive difference.\n\n457\n00:23:57.652 --> 00:24:01.470\nSo you should have most\neverything that I have.\n\n458\n00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:04.524\nBut of course,\nthen you're not on a 365 subscription, so\n\n459\n00:24:04.524 --> 00:24:06.300\nmaybe you won't have everything.\n\n460\n00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:07.659\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Wow, I just like totally\n\n461\n00:24:07.659 --> 00:24:08.843\ncontradicted myself.\n\n462\n00:24:08.843 --> 00:24:12.560\n[LAUGH] But\njust be aware that that is a possibility.\n\n463\n00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:16.410\nAnd I'm talking about the software\nupdates, I have this PDF, and\n\n464\n00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:18.070\nthis is included in the show notes.\n\n465\n00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:22.790\nTo where current channel deferred channel,\nthat's the other name right there.\n\n466\n00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:27.403\nSo you could see that you can\nchange this to which type of\n\n467\n00:24:27.403 --> 00:24:31.126\nscheduling that you have for your updates.\n\n468\n00:24:31.126 --> 00:24:34.295\nAnd then I have where you go\nonline to your actual account,\n\n469\n00:24:34.295 --> 00:24:35.988\nyou go into the admin section.\n\n470\n00:24:35.988 --> 00:24:39.144\nAnd then go into your download settings,\nand\n\n471\n00:24:39.144 --> 00:24:43.450\nthen that's where you can\nchange your update scheduling.\n\n472\n00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:47.098\nNow this is because I have\naccess to this account because I\n\n473\n00:24:47.098 --> 00:24:49.228\nam like the admin on the account.\n\n474\n00:24:49.228 --> 00:24:54.543\nBut I'm saying that it is possible that\nyou might not have access to this area\n\n475\n00:24:54.543 --> 00:25:00.630\nbecause of how your organization has their\nsoftware setup, like your whole network.\n\n476\n00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:04.345\nYou might not be able to cuz there's parts\nof it where you could lock this down to\n\n477\n00:25:04.345 --> 00:25:04.923\nend users.\n\n478\n00:25:04.923 --> 00:25:08.072\nLike you, as an end user, will not be\nable to change this particular feature.\n\n479\n00:25:08.072 --> 00:25:12.516\nAnd this meaning any,\nlike x, y, z type feature.\n\n480\n00:25:12.516 --> 00:25:16.260\nSo if you're like I can't get to this,\nthen it's probably because they set it to\n\n481\n00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:18.420\nwhere they don't want\nyou messing with this.\n\n482\n00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:23.073\n[LAUGH] And that you're IT\ndepartment has that control,\n\n483\n00:25:23.073 --> 00:25:25.552\nand as an end user you don't.\n\n484\n00:25:25.552 --> 00:25:27.320\nSo, gotta keep everybody on the same\n\n485\n00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:28.089\ntrack-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n486\n00:25:28.089 --> 00:25:28.880\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; On the network,\n\n487\n00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:29.628\nyou know about all that-\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n488\n00:25:29.628 --> 00:25:31.791\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, yep, and that goes ahead and\n\n489\n00:25:31.791 --> 00:25:33.478\nfinishes up my slide presentation.\n\n490\n00:25:33.478 --> 00:25:37.833\nLike I said just getting us started,\ngetting us familiar of what we're gonna be\n\n491\n00:25:37.833 --> 00:25:40.381\ntalking about throughout\nthis whole series.\n\n492\n00:25:40.381 --> 00:25:44.981\nAnd just like what is Excel all together,\nand what our set up is, and\n\n493\n00:25:44.981 --> 00:25:48.793\nhow we're going to proceed\nwith learning about Excel.\n\n494\n00:25:48.793 --> 00:25:49.543\nSo stay tuned.\n\n495\n00:25:49.543 --> 00:25:51.470\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Vonne,\nit sounds like it's gonna be a lot of fun.\n\n496\n00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:56.203\nWe're gonna learn about Excel, and\nI'm wishing you the best in teaching me.\n\n497\n00:25:56.203 --> 00:25:57.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because I've\n\n498\n00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:58.910\nhad troubles throughout\nmy life with Excel.\n\n499\n00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:00.780\nMe and\nExcel don't really get along that well.\n\n500\n00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:03.790\nBut I think that you might have\nthe magic key to make that happen,\n\n501\n00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:06.340\nso I really look forward to this series.\n\n502\n00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:08.315\nHopefully you do as well,\nit looks like a lot of fun.\n\n503\n00:26:08.315 --> 00:26:11.300\nSo definitely join us throughout this,\nlearn about Excel.\n\n504\n00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:14.410\nIt's something commonly\nused in many businesses.\n\n505\n00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:16.992\nAnd the lowest common denominator.\n\n506\n00:26:16.992 --> 00:26:19.580\nYou're gonna have a great skill\nthat's gonna help you out in your\n\n507\n00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:20.720\nday to day life.\n\n508\n00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.650\nVonne, thanks for joining us again,\nwe do thank our audience for watching.\n\n509\n00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:26.010\nBut it is that time for\nus to sign off

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:10.432 --> 00:00:11.930\nI am your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:17.370\nAnd in today's episode, well, we are\nmoving forward in our excel essentials.\n\n5\n00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.650\nAnd that's 2016 for\nthose of you keeping score.\n\n6\n00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.900\nAnd joining us in the studio to help\ncontinue our knowledge base, growing and\n\n7\n00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.200\ngrowing, that is our good friend,\nMs. Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.370\nVonne, thank you for\njoining us today, and how are you?\n\n9\n00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.470\n&gt;&gt; I'm fantastic, always glad to be here,\nand I always like to start at the very\n\n10\n00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.640\nbeginning, and\nthat's what this episode is about.\n\n11\n00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.831\nWell, we had our introduction, and\nnow we're moving on to Excel basics.\n\n12\n00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:42.348\nAnd really, this is more not just Excel\nbasics, this is also more Windows in\n\n13\n00:00:42.348 --> 00:00:46.630\ngeneral basics, and just getting\nstarted from the very beginning.\n\n14\n00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.970\nWe don't like to\nhypothesize about anything.\n\n15\n00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:49.650\n&gt;&gt; No we don't.\n\n16\n00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.548\n&gt;&gt; So that's why I like to cover all\nthe basics, and get us started before we\n\n17\n00:00:54.548 --> 00:00:58.500\nmove on into typing in text and\ndoing all our fun formulas.\n\n18\n00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.140\nWell, that's actually a separate show,\nbut [LAUGH].\n\n19\n00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But we'll get started in Excel after\n\n20\n00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:04.360\nwe do this.\n\n21\n00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.240\nSo I have our computer, we are using Mr.\nJustin Timberlake's computer,\n\n22\n00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160\njust like if you've watched some of our\nword shows, you might see this desktop,\n\n23\n00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.010\nthis beautiful scenic view, so.\n\n24\n00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.165\n&gt;&gt; Timber on the lake,\nit's very, very nice.\n\n25\n00:01:17.165 --> 00:01:19.871\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is, I know I love those little puns,\n\n26\n00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:21.148\nI'm so punny.\n\n27\n00:01:21.148 --> 00:01:25.930\nAll right, so, we have our computer,\nand we need to Start Excel,\n\n28\n00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.900\nthat's step number one.\n\n29\n00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.630\nSo, where do we go to start Excel?\n\n30\n00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.873\nWell, you can always\ngo to your Start Menu.\n\n31\n00:01:31.873 --> 00:01:35.681\nAnd I am using Windows 10 like we talked\nabout in our introduction when we were\n\n32\n00:01:35.681 --> 00:01:37.380\ngoing over our setup here.\n\n33\n00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.800\nSo I can go to my Start Menu,\n\n34\n00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.170\nand it brings up everything that is\nin my computer, all my programs.\n\n35\n00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.020\nAnd I can scroll on down to the E's.\n\n36\n00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.720\nThis alphabetized this for us now,\nand I can launch Excel right here.\n\n37\n00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.453\nI tend to not always go,\nI don't go to the Start Menu anymore.\n\n38\n00:01:53.453 --> 00:01:54.429\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n39\n00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:56.746\n&gt;&gt; You get a Quick Start menu or\na Quick Launch menu?\n\n40\n00:01:56.746 --> 00:01:57.831\n&gt;&gt; No, I just type it in the search.\n\n41\n00:01:57.831 --> 00:01:59.075\nI type it in the search, yeah.\n\n42\n00:01:59.075 --> 00:02:00.361\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I've just got so\n\n43\n00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:01.908\nused to doing it that way.\n\n44\n00:02:01.908 --> 00:02:03.310\n&gt;&gt; If you've got Windows 10,\nyou can do the Cortana.\n\n45\n00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.110\nCortana, start Excel for me.\n\n46\n00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.955\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n47\n00:02:06.955 --> 00:02:10.434\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't even use Siri the way it should\n\n48\n00:02:10.434 --> 00:02:12.514\nbe used,\njust like I'll just type everything in.\n\n49\n00:02:12.514 --> 00:02:15.266\nI guess I'm old school like better\nsomething, just I don't know,\n\n50\n00:02:15.266 --> 00:02:17.164\nI don't wanna hear myself talk or\nsomething.\n\n51\n00:02:17.164 --> 00:02:18.238\n&gt;&gt; You're so three years ago.\n\n52\n00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:20.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't wanna hear myself talk, and\n\n53\n00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.490\nlook at what I do for a living [LAUGH].\n\n54\n00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.130\n&gt;&gt; Don says he doesn't like talking\nto computers [LAUGH], so he's like,\n\n55\n00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.110\nI'm not doing that [LAUGH].\n\n56\n00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.422\n&gt;&gt; That's awesome.\n\n57\n00:02:28.422 --> 00:02:29.125\nWe're such a weird bunch.\n\n58\n00:02:29.125 --> 00:02:30.402\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we are.\n\n59\n00:02:30.402 --> 00:02:33.465\n&gt;&gt; So I do like to use the search,\nwhich is right down there.\n\n60\n00:02:33.465 --> 00:02:37.783\nAnd all I have to do is type in the letter\nE, X and then it brings it right up,\n\n61\n00:02:37.783 --> 00:02:39.061\nand then I hit enter.\n\n62\n00:02:39.061 --> 00:02:43.405\nI'm also more of a keyboard person too,\nso I guess that's why I like that.\n\n63\n00:02:43.405 --> 00:02:46.948\nSo I can go ahead and\nalways launch it from that Windows help or\n\n64\n00:02:46.948 --> 00:02:50.641\nwindows search right down there,\nand it starts it right on up.\n\n65\n00:02:50.641 --> 00:02:54.547\n&gt;&gt; I always found the Excel green very\nsoothing to my eye, I don't know why.\n\n66\n00:02:54.547 --> 00:02:55.730\n&gt;&gt; I think it's a green.\n\n67\n00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:56.470\n&gt;&gt; It's very nice.\n\n68\n00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.292\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I mean,\ngreen's a very very common color.\n\n69\n00:02:58.292 --> 00:03:00.640\n&gt;&gt; It makes me feel like I'm\ngoing to like this program for\n\n70\n00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.680\nsome strange reason, I don't know why.\n\n71\n00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.564\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No you know it's madly difficult, or\n\n72\n00:03:04.564 --> 00:03:07.801\ncan get there, but\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I think it's one of those,\n\n73\n00:03:07.801 --> 00:03:11.996\nthis program is very misunderstood,\nI think, sometimes.\n\n74\n00:03:11.996 --> 00:03:14.792\nAnd people are like I need so\nmuch help in Excel, but\n\n75\n00:03:14.792 --> 00:03:18.239\nthey do all these like kind of\nadvanced things that Excel does,\n\n76\n00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.250\nbut then they're like how do\nI get the lines to show up?\n\n77\n00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.579\nLike what do you mean the lines between\nthe, [INAUDIBLE] I'm like the borders?\n\n78\n00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.300\nIt's like, yeah.\n\n79\n00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.440\nAnd to me, I'm like, that's super basic,\nbut it's one of those.\n\n80\n00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.910\nAnd I feel like people kinda\nskip over the basics, and\n\n81\n00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.590\nthey wanna go right to\nthe middle of the book.\n\n82\n00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.200\nIt's like no, start from the beginning.\n\n83\n00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.130\nAnd that's why we always start all of our\nshows, all of our different programs,\n\n84\n00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.260\nwith the very very beginning\nto start with the basics.\n\n85\n00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.659\nWhich a lot of people skip over, and\nthey realize that that's how you do that.\n\n86\n00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:52.990\nSo that's my philosophy\non all of these programs.\n\n87\n00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:58.087\nBut yes, Excel does a lot of stuff, and\nit gets out of the realm for me too,\n\n88\n00:03:58.087 --> 00:04:03.530\nwhere I'm just like, I have no idea how\nyou made that function work properly.\n\n89\n00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.177\nAnd so\nwhen we're talking about calculations,\n\n90\n00:04:05.177 --> 00:04:06.792\nthat's what I'm talking about, functions.\n\n91\n00:04:06.792 --> 00:04:12.098\nSo, but yes, it is very soothing, and\nwe have our Start screen right here.\n\n92\n00:04:12.098 --> 00:04:15.522\nAnd just like with all of our\nOffice products, like Word and\n\n93\n00:04:15.522 --> 00:04:19.497\nPowerpoint and Excel, we have our\nmost recently used items over here\n\n94\n00:04:19.497 --> 00:04:22.944\non the left that we could go ahead and\nclick on to open a file.\n\n95\n00:04:22.944 --> 00:04:25.821\nAnd we also have some\nof our blank workbooks,\n\n96\n00:04:25.821 --> 00:04:28.326\nour templates that we can choose from.\n\n97\n00:04:28.326 --> 00:04:32.859\nAnd these templates that we have in\nhere are like the academic calendar,\n\n98\n00:04:32.859 --> 00:04:37.264\nthe process map, these are all of\nthe ones that come with the program.\n\n99\n00:04:37.264 --> 00:04:41.510\nAnd if you're connected to the Internet,\nthey are from Office Online.\n\n100\n00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.260\nSo, if you're not connected to the\nInternet, it won't show these such things.\n\n101\n00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.020\nI was just recently on a plane,\nactually prepping for this show.\n\n102\n00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.210\nAnd I'm like yeah, I don't have the Gogo\nin flight thing or what have you.\n\n103\n00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.820\nSo I wasn't connected to the Internet.\n\n104\n00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.097\nSo I didn't see any of these things.\n\n105\n00:04:57.097 --> 00:05:00.940\nSo that does kind of play into, or\nif you're not connected to the Internet,\n\n106\n00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.203\nit will only show you some of the locally\ninstalled ones like the loan amortization,\n\n107\n00:05:05.203 --> 00:05:08.204\nand a couple others that have\nbeen there since forever ago,\n\n108\n00:05:08.204 --> 00:05:09.610\nthat's always been in it.\n\n109\n00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.423\n&gt;&gt; I wrote my own in C.\n\n110\n00:05:11.423 --> 00:05:12.710\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Really?\n\n111\n00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.190\n&gt;&gt; Loan amortization, yeah, I did that.\n\n112\n00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.170\n&gt;&gt; Wow, just for fun?\n\n113\n00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.380\n&gt;&gt; No, because I couldn't find\na loan amortization program, and\n\n114\n00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.290\nI didn't know how to do it in Excel,\ncuz we hadn't shot this show yet.\n\n115\n00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.810\nI'm very Excel ignorant, by the way.\n\n116\n00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:25.346\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you went to C,\n\n117\n00:05:25.346 --> 00:05:26.222\nthe programming language?\n\n118\n00:05:26.222 --> 00:05:30.866\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, while I was learning that,\nI thought, I'll bang this out in 12 or\n\n119\n00:05:30.866 --> 00:05:31.660\n13 hours.\n\n120\n00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.390\nYeah, I'm like 500 lines deep.\n\n121\n00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.430\nIt works.\n\n122\n00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.450\nIt works really well.\n\n123\n00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.600\n&gt;&gt; When you could have just opened\nExcel and clicked the template and\n\n124\n00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.125\ntyped the little things and\nit went [SOUND], and\n\n125\n00:05:39.125 --> 00:05:40.277\nit just spits it right out for you.\n\n126\n00:05:40.277 --> 00:05:42.970\nHey, you know what-\n&gt;&gt; Where were you last week?\n\n127\n00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:43.575\nWhere was Vonne?\n\n128\n00:05:43.575 --> 00:05:45.062\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We like to take those\nroads less traveled sometimes.\n\n129\n00:05:45.062 --> 00:05:47.325\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, really love you down there, V.\n\n130\n00:05:47.325 --> 00:05:48.272\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well,\n\n131\n00:05:48.272 --> 00:05:50.080\nI'm here to help you now, so.\n\n132\n00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.335\n&gt;&gt; Well thank goodness,\n\n133\n00:05:51.335 --> 00:05:55.306\ncuz this should be a whole lot easier\nthan doing it the way I did it [LAUGH].\n\n134\n00:05:55.306 --> 00:05:59.450\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it will be, so\nI will expand your knowledge in Excel now.\n\n135\n00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.290\n&gt;&gt; Teach me, Obi-wan [LAUGH].\n\n136\n00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:07.150\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, so we have our start screen\nfrom Excel, and we're gonna go ahead and\n\n137\n00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.350\njust start a blank document to just get\nfamiliar with everything within our\n\n138\n00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.930\nwindows.\n\n139\n00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.980\nBut before we leave here, another thing\nthat I like to do about starting up Excel.\n\n140\n00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:21.360\nYou can see that right now down on\nmy task bar, I have Word down here.\n\n141\n00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.436\nThat's pinned to my task bar,\njust like I have Outlook as well.\n\n142\n00:06:26.436 --> 00:06:29.350\nSo if it's programs that I'm\ngonna be using frequently,\n\n143\n00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.312\nlike through this entire Excel show for\n\n144\n00:06:31.312 --> 00:06:35.550\nthe next couple weeks that we're gonna be\nfilming this, I'm gonna pin it to there.\n\n145\n00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.210\nSo you could do this for any program,\nthis is not Excel based,\n\n146\n00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:39.898\nthis is Windows, really.\n\n147\n00:06:39.898 --> 00:06:44.523\nIf you right-click down on there,\nyou can see Pin to taskbar.\n\n148\n00:06:44.523 --> 00:06:48.920\nAnd when I click on that, next time that\nI close Excel down, it's just right there\n\n149\n00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.615\nfor me to quickly Click\n&gt;&gt; Quickly click.\n\n150\n00:06:51.615 --> 00:06:52.582\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that´s hard to say.\n\n151\n00:06:52.582 --> 00:06:54.542\nQuickly click on Yes.\n\n152\n00:06:54.542 --> 00:06:57.108\n&gt;&gt; I´ll have to do that as\na microphone test from now on.\n\n153\n00:06:57.108 --> 00:06:58.300\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, that´s going to get all\n\n154\n00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:58.800\njumbled for me.\n\n155\n00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the taco truck.\n\n156\n00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:02.000\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n157\n00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.510\nSo we have our blank workbook, and\nwill just go ahead and click on it.\n\n158\n00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.990\nAnd it goes ahead and starts Excel.\n\n159\n00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:14.380\nSo what can I do from here in just\nbasic window land in a sense.\n\n160\n00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.640\nEvery window that you have has\na title bar up at the top.\n\n161\n00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:22.550\nAnd this title bar is telling me that I'm\nin book one excel, so that's my program.\n\n162\n00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:27.679\nOver here on the right hand side, you have\nyour basic windows controls for minimize.\n\n163\n00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.360\nRestore down.\n\n164\n00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.058\nIt says restore down right now, but\n\n165\n00:07:31.058 --> 00:07:33.444\nit also will become your\nmaximize button as well.\n\n166\n00:07:33.444 --> 00:07:36.820\nAnd I have my close, the big red X.\n\n167\n00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.780\nAnd notice that you also have\nyour tool tips that happen.\n\n168\n00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:43.880\nThat's that hover to discover, that we\nhave on all of our basic computers.\n\n169\n00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.937\nTo where our basic rules\nof computers I say,\n\n170\n00:07:45.937 --> 00:07:49.448\nhowever to discover to see that that's\nwhat those buttons will do for you.\n\n171\n00:07:49.448 --> 00:07:54.515\nSo if I click minimize, that minimizes\nthe program, but it does not close\n\n172\n00:07:54.515 --> 00:08:00.320\nThe program or the file that I am\ncurrently using, so it's still there.\n\n173\n00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.620\nAnd I know that it's minimized,\n\n174\n00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:05.710\nbecause it's got that little kind\nof blue bar down at the bottom.\n\n175\n00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:07.401\nWell zooming in doesn't really help there.\n\n176\n00:08:07.401 --> 00:08:07.901\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n177\n00:08:07.901 --> 00:08:09.351\n&gt;&gt; But there's a tiny little blue bar\n\n178\n00:08:09.351 --> 00:08:12.751\nunderneath there that says that that\nthere's something open in that particular\n\n179\n00:08:12.751 --> 00:08:15.813\nprogram.\nJust like I also have some other things.\n\n180\n00:08:15.813 --> 00:08:17.053\nI have some keyboard shortcut\n\n181\n00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.380\nURLs that I have.\n\n182\n00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:22.150\nBut you can see I've just minimized it so\nI don't see it.\n\n183\n00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:24.990\nSo how do I bring it\nback up from the taskbar?\n\n184\n00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:27.430\nYou just click it then\nit brings that back up.\n\n185\n00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.990\nAlso when we get into multiple ones\nyou can see when I hover over that\n\n186\n00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:35.430\nicon down at the bottom, the taskbar\nthat it shows me the different open or\n\n187\n00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:40.340\nactive files that I have open\nwithin this particular program.\n\n188\n00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:41.150\nSo there we go.\n\n189\n00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:42.250\nWe have minimized.\n\n190\n00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:43.190\nNow, this one right here,\n\n191\n00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:47.620\nthis is our restore down button because\nright now this is the maximized window.\n\n192\n00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:54.190\nIf I click on this, you can see that it\nrestores it down to a now floating window,\n\n193\n00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:58.170\nif you wanna say, that I can move\naround within my environment.\n\n194\n00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.300\nNow how do you move this around?\n\n195\n00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:04.010\nBy that task bar, or sorry, that's not\nthe task bar, that's the title bar.\n\n196\n00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:07.639\nThe title bar, you can go ahead and move\nthis around, cuz if you have multiple open\n\n197\n00:09:07.639 --> 00:09:10.383\nwindows, you want to kind of do this,\nthat's totally fine.\n\n198\n00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:15.282\nNow you can see that this button in\nthat particular place has turned to just\n\n199\n00:09:15.282 --> 00:09:16.001\na square.\n\n200\n00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.620\nAnd now it is our maximize button,\nwhen you click on that,\n\n201\n00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:26.220\nit will maximize to the full\nscreen within your monitor.\n\n202\n00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.290\nNow that's of course if\nyou have a single monitor.\n\n203\n00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.750\nBut whatever monitor you have,\nwhether you have two, three,\n\n204\n00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:34.750\nfour monitors it will maximize\nthat particular space.\n\n205\n00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:37.550\nSo that´s what we have with\nthose particular buttons.\n\n206\n00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:41.900\nAnd you have the big red X which\nis closing the entire program.\n\n207\n00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:46.470\nThe whole program and the file as well.\n\n208\n00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:47.580\nSo let´s do that.\n\n209\n00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:51.330\nI click on the red X,\nit closes it down, Excel has closed and\n\n210\n00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.420\nthe file I have been working\nwith has been closed.\n\n211\n00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:55.275\nCool.\n\n212\n00:09:55.275 --> 00:10:00.830\nNow, what about getting into files\nthat I have already created.\n\n213\n00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:04.710\nFile, Open, there is well,\na couple of ways you could do this.\n\n214\n00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.160\nI have files on my desktop.\n\n215\n00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:11.120\nRight here I have our christmas cat,\na cat's example file that we'll be seeing.\n\n216\n00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.960\nI wonder what's going to be in there.\n\n217\n00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.112\nMore cats\n&gt;&gt; Dogs on Halloween.\n\n218\n00:10:15.112 --> 00:10:16.040\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So you can\n\n219\n00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:20.130\ndouble click the file from the desktop or\n\n220\n00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:26.290\nyour windows explorer the little icon\nright here, or there's also Windows+E.\n\n221\n00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:28.790\nIf you have a Windows key there's\nlike an actual Windows key\n\n222\n00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:30.990\non the Keyboard to the right hand side.\n\n223\n00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:33.193\nAnd then E for explorer.\n\n224\n00:10:33.193 --> 00:10:35.410\nOr you can just click\nthis button right here.\n\n225\n00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:36.630\nWhich goes ahead and brings this up.\n\n226\n00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.660\nSo it doesn't matter where you're\nopening it from on your computer.\n\n227\n00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:45.240\nIf you just double click that\nExcel File It will open that file.\n\n228\n00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.750\nAll right.\n\n229\n00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.130\nWell, there's another way I could do it.\n\n230\n00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:50.940\nIf you start Excel up first, and\n\n231\n00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:54.510\nI've clicked it on the task\nbar down there at the bottom.\n\n232\n00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:55.910\nBrings this back up.\n\n233\n00:10:55.910 --> 00:11:00.010\nYou can see that there is open other\nworkbooks right here on the bottom left\n\n234\n00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:03.210\nhand side of this green pane.\n\n235\n00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:07.401\nAnd when I click on that it takes me\nto what is known as the backstage view,\n\n236\n00:11:07.401 --> 00:11:09.968\nbut this is also I just\ncall it the file menu.\n\n237\n00:11:09.968 --> 00:11:13.817\nI still call it the file menu even\nthough file menus have been gone\n\n238\n00:11:13.817 --> 00:11:17.400\nfrom Office products since\n2003 is when they started?\n\n239\n00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:19.410\n&gt;&gt; Yes I think so.\n\n240\n00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:20.850\n&gt;&gt; Was is 3 or 7?\n\n241\n00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:22.160\n&gt;&gt; I think 3.\n\n242\n00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:22.860\nRIght?\n\n243\n00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.180\nI wanna say three,\nI'm gonna go with three.\n\n244\n00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think I'm gonna with three too.\n\n245\n00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:28.570\n&gt;&gt; That's when they came out with\nthe first iteration of the ribbon.\n\n246\n00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:29.150\n&gt;&gt; Of the ribbon, yeah.\n\n247\n00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:32.250\nAnd they had the little office button\nat the top, that people were like,\n\n248\n00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:33.070\nwhere is the file menu?\n\n249\n00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:33.890\n&gt;&gt; What is going on?\n\n250\n00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:36.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it got a little confusing.\n\n251\n00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:40.740\nSo I think we're settled in\nto this kind of look by now.\n\n252\n00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:44.530\nBut this is our backstage file menu and\nthen I can go with open,\n\n253\n00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:46.510\nwhich I'm already on.\n\n254\n00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:48.550\nAnd then I can go down to browse.\n\n255\n00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:52.210\nBut you can see it does bring me into\ndifferent places like my OneDrive account.\n\n256\n00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:57.670\nIf I have that set up from whatever\nOffice 365 subscription that I have.\n\n257\n00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:01.972\nIf you don't have a Office 365\nsubscription then you don't have\n\n258\n00:12:01.972 --> 00:12:04.471\nthis particular version of OneDrive.\n\n259\n00:12:04.471 --> 00:12:07.190\nThere is a OneDrive that comes\nwith your operating system.\n\n260\n00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:09.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthere's a free version that they give you,\n\n261\n00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:13.385\ncuz they want you to get your feet wet in\nsome sort of cloud service from Microsoft.\n\n262\n00:12:13.385 --> 00:12:14.308\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n263\n00:12:14.308 --> 00:12:15.690\nthere is a difference-\n&gt;&gt; There is.\n\n264\n00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:18.870\n&gt;&gt; Between your OneDrive\nconnected to your Office 365 and\n\n265\n00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:24.510\nyour OneDrive that comes installed with\nthe operating system of Windows 10.\n\n266\n00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:28.200\nAnd they are different,\nthey are two separate locations.\n\n267\n00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.111\nWhich I think that gets\na little confusing.\n\n268\n00:12:30.111 --> 00:12:34.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I don't know if they do this,\nor if they don't they should,\n\n269\n00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:38.554\nif you do end up getting\na Office 365 subscription,\n\n270\n00:12:38.554 --> 00:12:44.030\nyes they should merge together and\nbecome one thing, one point of contact.\n\n271\n00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:47.399\nAnd if you ever delete your\nsubscription or don't renew,\n\n272\n00:12:47.399 --> 00:12:51.334\nthen it would drop you back to\nthe free tier operating system level.\n\n273\n00:12:51.334 --> 00:12:53.981\n&gt;&gt; I completely concur\nwith that sentiment,\n\n274\n00:12:53.981 --> 00:12:57.050\nbecause it is extremely confusing for\npeople.\n\n275\n00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:58.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And so that's where, or\n\n276\n00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:00.090\nname it differently.\n\n277\n00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:01.470\n&gt;&gt; Microsoft, if you're listening.\n\n278\n00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:04.162\nJust one man's musings, just saying.\n\n279\n00:13:04.162 --> 00:13:04.797\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n280\n00:13:04.797 --> 00:13:07.621\nthat's why we're to help you try\nto differentiate all of those\n\n281\n00:13:07.621 --> 00:13:08.536\ndifferent things.\n\n282\n00:13:08.536 --> 00:13:12.311\nBut yes, in a perfect world it would\nwork like that but it doesn't.\n\n283\n00:13:12.311 --> 00:13:14.910\nSo have to think of, okay,\nit's like two different purses.\n\n284\n00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:15.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n285\n00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:18.860\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, I guess that's where I go to-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Me too, right there.\n\n286\n00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:19.415\nI love my purses.\n\n287\n00:13:19.415 --> 00:13:20.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n288\n00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:24.820\nSo there's two different places that\nwe can go to open our files, OneDrive.\n\n289\n00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:29.170\nAnd there's OneDrive right there,\nand then we have browse,\n\n290\n00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:30.790\nto where we can go anywhere within.\n\n291\n00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.901\nTo me,\nthis is like the old school dialogue box.\n\n292\n00:13:32.901 --> 00:13:34.630\nI like this one.\n\n293\n00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:35.210\nI'm used to it.\n\n294\n00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:36.240\nIt's comforting to me.\n\n295\n00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:41.210\nSo, then I can go out to my desktop or to\nwhatever folder that I have my files in,\n\n296\n00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:44.280\nwhich is sometimes the hardest part,\nis remembering where your files are.\n\n297\n00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.850\nThat's why that search is always good.\n\n298\n00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:46.990\nWindows search is awesome.\n\n299\n00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:50.840\nSo that I can open up\nthe Christmas Cats example.\n\n300\n00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:56.180\nAnd now I have our\nChristmas Cats Weekly Sales, beautiful.\n\n301\n00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:58.534\nAnd now I have an open file.\n\n302\n00:13:58.534 --> 00:14:02.924\nWhat if I want to start another\nfile because I'm gonna be copy and\n\n303\n00:14:02.924 --> 00:14:05.580\npasting from one place to the other.\n\n304\n00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:09.620\nAnd so I need to take some stuff out of\nthis file and put it into a new file.\n\n305\n00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:10.700\nAnd do a save.\n\n306\n00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.499\nSo we're gonna cover all of that,\nwe're not gonna do the copy and paste.\n\n307\n00:14:12.499 --> 00:14:13.141\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n308\n00:14:13.141 --> 00:14:13.711\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n309\n00:14:13.711 --> 00:14:15.510\njust worry you with multiple windows.\n\n310\n00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:19.550\nSo now I'm gonna come back over to File,\nand now I have this New button, or\n\n311\n00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:20.760\nNew option here.\n\n312\n00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.170\nAnd then it says,\nwell what do you wanna start with?\n\n313\n00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:25.370\nSo I wanna start with a Blank document or\n\n314\n00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:28.710\nfrom a Template that is from\nOffice Online or built in.\n\n315\n00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:33.590\nI'm gonna say blank workbook, and now I\nhave two files that I'm working with.\n\n316\n00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:38.500\nSo working with multiple windows,\na few things that we can go over.\n\n317\n00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.910\nI do know that we have two files.\n\n318\n00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:41.540\nBecause you can barely see, and\n\n319\n00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:43.460\nit's probably not gonna come\nthrough on this recording either.\n\n320\n00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:47.180\nBut it's almost like there's\nstacks there's two like\n\n321\n00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:51.620\npieces of paper that are going on\nin this icon down in the task bar.\n\n322\n00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.600\nAnd the other thing that I can see when\nI hover, I'm not clicking anything,\n\n323\n00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:59.000\nI'm hovering over to see that I have\nthe Christmas cats and I have the book 1.\n\n324\n00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.830\nSo this is where if I wanna switch\nback and forth I can just hover.\n\n325\n00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:04.180\nClick on Christmas Cats.\n\n326\n00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:08.860\nAnd now this is my active workbook or\nwindow, really, that's in front.\n\n327\n00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.340\nHover over, go ahead and\nclick on book one.\n\n328\n00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:14.690\nAnd then I can move back and\nforth between those different workbooks,\n\n329\n00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:17.525\nthat are fully maximized on the screen.\n\n330\n00:15:17.525 --> 00:15:20.110\n&gt;&gt; It seems like Windows is\ngrouping like items together.\n\n331\n00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:21.850\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It sure is.\n\n332\n00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:24.775\n[LAUGH] It's exactly what it's doing.\n\n333\n00:15:24.775 --> 00:15:27.345\nAnd this is where if you had Word you\nwould have the same thing I could have\n\n334\n00:15:27.345 --> 00:15:31.867\na free word documents open and\nthree Excel documents are workbook style.\n\n335\n00:15:31.867 --> 00:15:34.807\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if anybody out there\nremembers the nightmare that used to be\n\n336\n00:15:34.807 --> 00:15:37.537\nthe old task bar before this style?\n\n337\n00:15:37.537 --> 00:15:39.740\nYou just had [NOISE] it was\nall across the thing and\n\n338\n00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:42.122\nit was just crazy It would\nstart jumping up levels.\n\n339\n00:15:42.122 --> 00:15:43.550\nIt was insane.\n\n340\n00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:44.870\nThis is the much better version.\n\n341\n00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:48.680\nBut now I was like, any Word documents I\nhave open, I just hover over the Word.\n\n342\n00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:49.683\nExcel, not a problem,\n\n343\n00:15:49.683 --> 00:15:52.254\ndo the exact same thing keeps\nit a little neater and cleaner.\n\n344\n00:15:52.254 --> 00:15:57.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz every single instance of\nthat file was one icon on the task bar.\n\n345\n00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:00.020\nYeah, it was definitely\na little bit of a mess.\n\n346\n00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:01.866\nSo yes, grouping is fantastic.\n\n347\n00:16:01.866 --> 00:16:05.080\nSo I can start going ahead and going\nback and forth with my Excel documents.\n\n348\n00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.100\nNow some other things that we could do,\n\n349\n00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.110\nif I need to see one file\nnext to another file.\n\n350\n00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:14.366\nOoh, there's some cute\nthings that Windows will do.\n\n351\n00:16:14.366 --> 00:16:18.855\nNow I said we could use this restore down\nbutton that's on our buttons over on\n\n352\n00:16:18.855 --> 00:16:20.127\nthe right hand side.\n\n353\n00:16:20.127 --> 00:16:25.932\nBut the title bar, the other thing you\ncould do is if you grab the title bar and\n\n354\n00:16:25.932 --> 00:16:32.670\nclick, hold, and drag down, it's almost\nlike undocking it from its maximized view.\n\n355\n00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:35.170\nAnd then you let go and\nthen you hold it down.\n\n356\n00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:36.150\nThe same way, by the way,\n\n357\n00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:41.270\nif you double click on a title\nit will maximize the window.\n\n358\n00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:42.740\nAnd again, this is all Windows.\n\n359\n00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.590\nThis is not Excel exclusive.\n\n360\n00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:46.860\nThis is like your File Explorer.\n\n361\n00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.060\nSo anything can work with that.\n\n362\n00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:51.310\nSo I'm gonna click hold and\ndrag down, pull this to float this.\n\n363\n00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:54.680\nI'm gonna come over here to Christmas\ncats and do the same thing, click hold,\n\n364\n00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:55.202\ndrag down.\n\n365\n00:16:55.202 --> 00:16:59.958\nSo now I have two of these\nwindows here.in Excel that I can\n\n366\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:03.428\nkinda start moving around and resizing,\n\n367\n00:17:03.428 --> 00:17:08.960\nget my two pointed white arrows\non either sides of any of this.\n\n368\n00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.490\nBut there's also some things\nthat you can do in Windows that\n\n369\n00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:16.110\nI just think I call it cute\nbecause it's cute to me.\n\n370\n00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:20.850\nYou can dock them to\nthe sides of your monitor.\n\n371\n00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:24.720\nSo if I grab the title bar, click hold and\ndrag, just keep on going, going, going,\n\n372\n00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.880\nyou see how as soon as I get\nclose enough to the edge,\n\n373\n00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:31.630\nit kind of ghosts this\narea to the back of it.\n\n374\n00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:37.660\nWhen I let go, it docks it right\nup into that side of the screen.\n\n375\n00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:40.570\nNow the cool thing is that it\nbrings up hey you know what?\n\n376\n00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:46.030\nI'm actually seeing quite a few different\nother windows that you have open,\n\n377\n00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:50.500\nlike the Excel URLs that\nI have in edge right now.\n\n378\n00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:54.130\nAnd I also see that book too, so\nthis, again, straight up Windows,\n\n379\n00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:57.110\nI can pull up and\ndock two things next to each other and\n\n380\n00:17:57.110 --> 00:18:00.380\ncompare them, if you wanna say,\nside by side.\n\n381\n00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:01.470\nI click on Book 1.\n\n382\n00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:05.560\nAll I have to do is click it, and\nit automatically goes ahead and\n\n383\n00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.810\nputs it next to each other.\n\n384\n00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:09.030\nLove that little trick.\n\n385\n00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:10.730\nIt's really really handy.\n\n386\n00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:12.410\nAnd now that you've put\nthem next to each other,\n\n387\n00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:14.240\nyou can do the same thing\nthat we did before.\n\n388\n00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:18.307\nJust grab those title bars and\nthen go ahead and click, hold and\n\n389\n00:18:18.307 --> 00:18:23.297\ndrag down, undock them from their\nlocations and then you can maximize them,\n\n390\n00:18:23.297 --> 00:18:25.860\nyou can double click on the title bars.\n\n391\n00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:28.404\nComing back over, hovering,\ncoming to book one.\n\n392\n00:18:28.404 --> 00:18:31.612\nIt remembered the size, if you wanna say,\n\n393\n00:18:31.612 --> 00:18:36.500\nthe restored down state and\nthen I can maximize them back up.\n\n394\n00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:40.920\nSo just working around multiple windows.\n\n395\n00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.400\nNow another thing that I love,\nI love keyboard shortcuts.\n\n396\n00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:49.610\nSo switching back and\nforth between multiple windows altogether,\n\n397\n00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:54.260\nif you hold your alt key on your keyboard\nand then click your tab key, you\n\n398\n00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:57.290\nsee that brings up, I'm still holding the\nalt key down on my keyboard, by the way.\n\n399\n00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:02.360\nI just click the tab key and if I click\nthe tab again, click, click, click.\n\n400\n00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:07.670\nDo you see how that little white box\nis going around to say, that when I let\n\n401\n00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:13.480\ngo of my alt key right now,\nthat will become my active window.\n\n402\n00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.140\nSo hold the alt again,\nclick, click, click the tab.\n\n403\n00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.330\nOkay, I want the book 1.\n\n404\n00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:19.543\nLet go, then there's book 1.\n\n405\n00:19:19.543 --> 00:19:21.926\nI love alt tab, it's fantastic.\n\n406\n00:19:21.926 --> 00:19:23.398\n&gt;&gt; So Vonne, tell the truth.\n\n407\n00:19:23.398 --> 00:19:27.600\nDid you learn this little trick\nwhile you're searching TMZ or\n\n408\n00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.220\nwhatever it is you're doing, and\nthen the boss comes walking by,\n\n409\n00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:33.940\nyou can quickly alt tab, and no, I was\nin this Excel spreadsheet right here.\n\n410\n00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:34.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I don't\n\n411\n00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:36.365\nknow what you're talking about TMZ.\n\n412\n00:19:36.365 --> 00:19:37.420\nI don't know what that is.\n\n413\n00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:39.701\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I've never done that, no.\n\n414\n00:19:39.701 --> 00:19:42.744\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, guilty.\n\n415\n00:19:42.744 --> 00:19:44.355\n&gt;&gt; Of course.\n\n416\n00:19:44.355 --> 00:19:48.167\nBut then, of course, if you had somebody\nthat they can look down at your task bar,\n\n417\n00:19:48.167 --> 00:19:51.263\ncuz I've done that, cuz you might\ncatch a glimpse an I look down and\n\n418\n00:19:51.263 --> 00:19:52.499\nI'm like, mm-hm.\n\n419\n00:19:52.499 --> 00:19:56.088\nAnd especially back in the day when you\nhad all those open and you're like mm-hm,\n\n420\n00:19:56.088 --> 00:19:58.947\nbut yes, that it is a quick\nlittle way that's really fun.\n\n421\n00:19:58.947 --> 00:20:01.277\nAlso while we're doing it,\nif you want an even quicker way,\n\n422\n00:20:01.277 --> 00:20:02.910\nlike just minimizing everything.\n\n423\n00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:04.680\nThere's your Windows key d.\n\n424\n00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.790\nI can't do it because I don't\nhave a Windows keyboard.\n\n425\n00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:13.010\nBut Windows key d for desktop and it will\nminimize everything into your desktop.\n\n426\n00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:14.750\nLove that.\n&gt;&gt; Great shortcut.\n\n427\n00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:18.570\n&gt;&gt; It's the best, so\nthose are a lot of my favorites.\n\n428\n00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:22.570\nAll right, so now, let's talk about,\nlet's get to the right one [LAUGH].\n\n429\n00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:27.290\nWe have a file here and this is a file\nnew, so it does not have any name or home.\n\n430\n00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:30.250\nIt doesn't have a location\nof where it's going.\n\n431\n00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:32.060\nOr what we're gonna save, okay [LAUGH].\n\n432\n00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:36.330\nSo the difference between save and\nsave as,\n\n433\n00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:40.430\nwell right now with a brand new workbook,\nthey're the same thing,\n\n434\n00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:46.330\nbecause it doesn't have a current filename\nand current location where it's stored.\n\n435\n00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:49.420\nSo that's where this is only time save and\nsave as will ever be the same.\n\n436\n00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:55.140\nSo if I click on save,\nnotice it's always gonna go to save as but\n\n437\n00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.370\nthere is there where that difference is.\n\n438\n00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:02.020\nLike save as is where you want to\ntake whatever current document\n\n439\n00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:07.220\nthat has a file name and location, and\nyou want to save it as something else,\n\n440\n00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:10.510\nwhether it's changed location,\nmaybe you've made some changes.\n\n441\n00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:13.770\nCuz let's actually switch back\nover here to the Christmas cats.\n\n442\n00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:17.550\nLet's say I have this Christmas cats,\nsuper cute.\n\n443\n00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:23.310\nAnd I came in and changed something\nfrom the week of the third to-\n\n444\n00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:25.544\n&gt;&gt; Week of the tenth.\n\n445\n00:21:25.544 --> 00:21:26.196\n&gt;&gt; Okay, perfect.\n\n446\n00:21:26.196 --> 00:21:28.200\nI was gonna go with a date\nthat I can remember.\n\n447\n00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.590\nI'm like, I don't remember what day it is.\n\n448\n00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:32.880\nSo if I go into here,\nnow I've made my change.\n\n449\n00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:38.310\nBut if I did a save right now,\nit'd save this change to this file.\n\n450\n00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:39.610\nAnd I don't want that to happen.\n\n451\n00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:44.720\nI want it to have Christmas\ncats example with the same\n\n452\n00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:48.260\nJuly 3rd there,\nthis is gonna be a different one.\n\n453\n00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:51.024\nSo I'm gonna do a file save as.\n\n454\n00:21:51.024 --> 00:21:53.788\nSometimes people say like,\nI just know if I do that I'd make a copy.\n\n455\n00:21:53.788 --> 00:21:54.734\nLike it's a copy of them.\n\n456\n00:21:54.734 --> 00:21:58.023\nI'm like, okay I can-\n&gt;&gt; It can be used to do that.\n\n457\n00:21:58.023 --> 00:22:01.566\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, at least the idea of like\nI'm not changing the original.\n\n458\n00:22:01.566 --> 00:22:04.180\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So that's like however it goes best in\n\n459\n00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:08.470\nyour brain of, don´t change the original,\nthen that´s where you go with it.\n\n460\n00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:11.180\n&gt;&gt; I always think of it in the idea\nof okay, I´ve got the original,\n\n461\n00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:13.500\nthis is Christmas cats, right?\n\n462\n00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:17.680\nAnd then I want to make some changes and I\ndon´t want to worry about what I´ve done.\n\n463\n00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.510\nLike I could make just some really\nbad changes and not worry about it.\n\n464\n00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:22.220\nBut I want to save those changes.\n\n465\n00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:24.080\nI had a Christmas cats,\nthat's my original.\n\n466\n00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:27.230\nThen I would save as Christmas\ncats one with all my changes.\n\n467\n00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:29.370\nThat way I can compare and\ncontrast the two together.\n\n468\n00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:32.690\nAnd then if I made more changes,\nChristmas cats two,\n\n469\n00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:36.710\nChristmas cats is still pristine and\nthe original state hasn't been touched.\n\n470\n00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:39.040\nIt's still lovely and\nbeautiful the way it should be.\n\n471\n00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.570\nAnd I can continue to make changes and\n\n472\n00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:42.990\nsee changes that I've made\nthroughout the history.\n\n473\n00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:44.110\nSo that's how I like to use it.\n\n474\n00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:46.518\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah perfect explanation.\n\n475\n00:22:46.518 --> 00:22:47.831\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; Lovely, lovely.\n\n476\n00:22:47.831 --> 00:22:52.261\nSo now if I've made my changes,\nI do a file save as, just like we did, and\n\n477\n00:22:52.261 --> 00:22:55.036\nnow I can name it\nChristmas cats example two.\n\n478\n00:22:55.036 --> 00:22:56.452\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And then you start to win two,\n\n479\n00:22:56.452 --> 00:22:59.047\nthree, four, come back three years later\n&gt;&gt; You're like why do I have 12\n\n480\n00:22:59.047 --> 00:22:59.732\nChristmas cats?\n\n481\n00:22:59.732 --> 00:23:00.790\nThis is ridiculous.\n\n482\n00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:04.192\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like it meant something to you\nback in the day where it was like version\n\n483\n00:23:04.192 --> 00:23:07.755\ntwo, version three, and yeah,\nlike you come back a long time later.\n\n484\n00:23:07.755 --> 00:23:10.380\n&gt;&gt; Every so\noften it is a good idea to like go,\n\n485\n00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:13.619\nyou know Christmas Cats\nversion six is rock solid.\n\n486\n00:23:13.619 --> 00:23:16.257\nI'll go ahead and\ndelete five through zero, you know?\n\n487\n00:23:16.257 --> 00:23:19.615\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then rename that Christmas Cats.\n\n488\n00:23:19.615 --> 00:23:21.527\n&gt;&gt; Yep, yeah I've done it so many times.\n\n489\n00:23:21.527 --> 00:23:24.445\n[LAUGH] So you see I can change the name.\n\n490\n00:23:24.445 --> 00:23:26.115\nI could also change the location,\n\n491\n00:23:26.115 --> 00:23:28.980\nmaybe when I put this into my\nMy Documents instead of the Desktop.\n\n492\n00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:35.150\nSo within this dialogue box there is this\nlittle select to navigate one level up.\n\n493\n00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:38.530\nWell, one level up is this PC so\nI really probably shouldn't go there.\n\n494\n00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:43.127\nAgain, this is just me and\nmy old school ways I've not just as\n\n495\n00:23:43.127 --> 00:23:47.652\ncomfortable with this interface\nof doing the file save as.\n\n496\n00:23:47.652 --> 00:23:50.993\nI always go over here to the browse and\ngo to this dialog box.\n\n497\n00:23:50.993 --> 00:23:52.460\nI know it's the same.\n\n498\n00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:54.861\nIt's the same thing, but\nI'm just comfortable in this one.\n\n499\n00:23:54.861 --> 00:23:57.591\nSo I could say I wanna put\nit in to my Documents.\n\n500\n00:23:57.591 --> 00:24:00.364\nI can keep the same name.\n\n501\n00:24:00.364 --> 00:24:03.294\nAnd a different location and\nit becomes two different files.\n\n502\n00:24:03.294 --> 00:24:05.123\nThat's where you can really\nget yourself confused.\n\n503\n00:24:05.123 --> 00:24:08.441\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So always make sure you change\n\n504\n00:24:08.441 --> 00:24:13.344\nthat and if you do have, do you see\nhow mine right here where I'm showing\n\n505\n00:24:13.344 --> 00:24:17.782\nextensions on my computer,\ndon't change over the extension.\n\n506\n00:24:17.782 --> 00:24:21.034\n&gt;&gt; The dot something.\n\n507\n00:24:21.034 --> 00:24:25.642\n&gt;&gt; Yes, anything with a dot and\nthen to the right, do not mess with that.\n\n508\n00:24:25.642 --> 00:24:28.080\nBecause if you remove that dot,\nit can get a little weird.\n\n509\n00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:31.570\nNow it is saving it as an Excel file,\nso it should be all right.\n\n510\n00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:32.740\nAnd it should catch you.\n\n511\n00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:38.560\nBut just be a little careful of that when\nyou have show extensions on your system.\n\n512\n00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:44.840\nSo I'll name this two, in front of the\nperiod, click Save, and now I have that,\n\n513\n00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:49.650\nand I am now in that particular document,\nthat is my current document.\n\n514\n00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:52.130\nSo if I did a File, Open, and\n\n515\n00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:57.030\nwent back over to our Desktop from\nour browse cuz I wanna go this way.\n\n516\n00:24:57.030 --> 00:25:01.278\nI go here to Desktop, here's my Christmas\ncat, see there's the one with the three.\n\n517\n00:25:01.278 --> 00:25:05.886\nLooking at our title bar yep\nChristmas cat example is three.\n\n518\n00:25:05.886 --> 00:25:09.867\nHover, where is my example two\nthis is the one with the 10, so\n\n519\n00:25:09.867 --> 00:25:12.990\nthat's where we have our\nSave versus Save As.\n\n520\n00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:16.916\nSave just update changes because if\nI came over and said there we go,\n\n521\n00:25:16.916 --> 00:25:19.792\nthere's all the changes\nto this file File&gt; Save.\n\n522\n00:25:19.792 --> 00:25:24.170\nI have updated that file and\nnow it has remembered those changes, cool.\n\n523\n00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:30.631\nSo very basics of how to use your windows,\nhow to do some basic functions\n\n524\n00:25:30.631 --> 00:25:35.610\nlike File &gt; New, File &gt; Open,\nFile &gt; Save, File &gt; Save as.\n\n525\n00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:37.588\nWe also have File&gt; Close,\n\n526\n00:25:37.588 --> 00:25:42.330\nnow it used to be that they had\na couple of different buttons here.\n\n527\n00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:43.990\nBut now if you just do a red X right now,\n\n528\n00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:45.920\nremember I have three\nExcel files right now.\n\n529\n00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:50.820\nIf I close this, it's closing that whole\nfile down, but there's other ones open.\n\n530\n00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:55.400\nSo the program's still open,\nso if I close this.\n\n531\n00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:58.138\nNow if I'm here,\nthere is an actual command for\n\n532\n00:25:58.138 --> 00:26:02.420\na File &gt; Close, which is right here.\n\n533\n00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:04.660\nNotice that when I do that,\nit's closing the file.\n\n534\n00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:07.270\nBut the program still stays open.\n\n535\n00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:10.630\nSo, that's where it's a little different.\n\n536\n00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:11.729\nThey've gotten much better.\n\n537\n00:26:11.729 --> 00:26:14.850\nIf I just hit the red X until it closes\neverything down and you're fine.\n\n538\n00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:19.030\nSo it doesn't kinda have as much\nseparation as it used to back in the day.\n\n539\n00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:24.400\nBut I did wanna go ahead and at least show\nyou that they are two separate things.\n\n540\n00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:27.490\nClose the program versus close the file.\n\n541\n00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:29.560\nLet me minimize that.\n\n542\n00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.846\nAnd the last that I just wanted to kinda\ntouch on is just understanding your\n\n543\n00:26:32.846 --> 00:26:33.377\nkeyboard.\n\n544\n00:26:33.377 --> 00:26:38.662\nJust knowing that you have,\nif you have a fully extended keyboard,\n\n545\n00:26:38.662 --> 00:26:43.298\nyou have some groups of keys\nin your middle, like the Home,\n\n546\n00:26:43.298 --> 00:26:45.450\nEnd, Page Up, Page Down.\n\n547\n00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:50.070\nAnd you also have your number pad, there\nare some links in the show notes that give\n\n548\n00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:56.170\nyou some examples of keyboards and\njust the whole idea about input devices.\n\n549\n00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:58.880\nNow, if you're on a laptop, like me,\n\n550\n00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.900\nyou might not have like your Home and\nyour End and your Page Up and Page Down.\n\n551\n00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:07.180\nSo some of the different keyboard things\nthat I'm going to be talking about in\n\n552\n00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:11.300\nthe navigating a document,\nyou might not have access to.\n\n553\n00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:15.380\nSo having a full-size keyboard\nversus a not full-size keyboard.\n\n554\n00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:19.982\nOr if you're like me, you're using\nWindows 10 in virtual machine on a Mac.\n\n555\n00:27:19.982 --> 00:27:24.080\nSo [LAUGH] I have a whole other set\nof interesting things on top of that.\n\n556\n00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:27.130\nSo just kind of get familiar\nwith those different things,\n\n557\n00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:30.640\nlike what does the Enter key do, sorry,\nthe Return, no it is the Enter key.\n\n558\n00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:31.388\nIt's Return on the Mac.\n\n559\n00:27:31.388 --> 00:27:33.097\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n560\n00:27:33.097 --> 00:27:34.825\n&gt;&gt; The Spacebar, the Tab key,\n\n561\n00:27:34.825 --> 00:27:39.660\njust being familiar with that cuz we will\nbe going over that in the next episode.\n\n562\n00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:43.900\nSo that is my conclusion of Excel basics.\n\n563\n00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:48.420\n&gt;&gt; All right Yvonne, well that is\na great introduction to Excel basics.\n\n564\n00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:51.530\nAnd just going back to what you said\nat the beginning of the episode,\n\n565\n00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:54.530\ntalking about jumping into the middle,\nor doing more advanced things, and\n\n566\n00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:56.680\nthat being your starting spot,\nnot being a good idea.\n\n567\n00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:57.710\nI totally agree with you,\n\n568\n00:27:57.710 --> 00:28:01.460\neven though I'm guilty as charged,\nI have had to do that myself.\n\n569\n00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:04.490\nSo it's good for us to just get that\ngood foundational knowledge, so\n\n570\n00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:05.940\nthat we can build upon that.\n\n571\n00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:10.340\nAnd maybe even understand better what it\nis we already know if we do know something\n\n572\n00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:11.800\nas we move along down the road.\n\n573\n00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.150\nSo, Yvonne thanks for joining us today and\nteaching us these things.\n\n574\n00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:16.040\nWe do thank our audience for watching.\n\n575\n00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:19.010\nSigning off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n576\n00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:19.720\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Yvonne Smith.\n\n577\n00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.887\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n578\n00:28:21.887 --> 00:28:26.335\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

It's a little scary.\n\n23\n00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:51.061\n&gt;&gt; So it's quite enjoyable.\n\n24\n00:00:51.061 --> 00:00:51.561\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Scary.\n\n25\n00:00:51.561 --> 00:00:55.916\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But yes we are gonna\nbe talking about the Excel interface,\n\n26\n00:00:55.916 --> 00:00:58.787\nthe environment.\nWhatever you wanna call it is what we\n\n27\n00:00:58.787 --> 00:01:00.963\nare looking at so\nwe need to get familiar with it.\n\n28\n00:01:00.963 --> 00:01:02.964\nSo when I say hey let's go ahead and\n\n29\n00:01:02.964 --> 00:01:07.305\ninsert a picture, you know that that's\non the insert tab of the ribbon.\n\n30\n00:01:07.305 --> 00:01:10.635\nAnd when I say customize in the quick\naccess bar or let's go ahead and\n\n31\n00:01:10.635 --> 00:01:14.230\nlook at what the count\nis in our status bar.\n\n32\n00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.970\nYou're gonna know what I'm talking about.\n\n33\n00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.050\nRight now it might be\na little Greek right now,\n\n34\n00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.198\nbut I'm going to translate it into Excel.\n\n35\n00:01:21.198 --> 00:01:22.750\nSo, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I like that.\n\n36\n00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we're gonna go ahead and\nget started.\n\n37\n00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.040\nI have a file that we're\ngoing to be using.\n\n38\n00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.710\nJust to have just something to look at,\n\n39\n00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.450\nreally, we're not gonna be doing\nanything with the content.\n\n40\n00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.644\nCuz that's gonna be getting into,\nwhen we do the navigate a workbook and\n\n41\n00:01:38.644 --> 00:01:39.762\nthings like that.\n\n42\n00:01:39.762 --> 00:01:41.814\nThis is just the interface by itself.\n\n43\n00:01:41.814 --> 00:01:46.711\nBut we're gonna go back into our\nChristmas Cats example file that I\n\n44\n00:01:46.711 --> 00:01:48.289\nhave created for us.\n\n45\n00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.142\nWe got our cute little cat down there\nmeow, meow so [LAUGH] gotta make sound.\n\n46\n00:01:52.142 --> 00:01:54.590\n[LAUGH] So l look over and Daniel like.\n\n47\n00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.910\n&gt;&gt; Can you actually put the sound\neffects in there Excel?\n\n48\n00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.770\nI don't know if you can.\n\n49\n00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.670\n&gt;&gt; You just stumped me for\na second like can we answer sound file?\n\n50\n00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.230\nI'm sure we can.\n\n51\n00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.161\n&gt;&gt; Capstone project for the show, right?\n\n52\n00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:09.658\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Hover over a cat icon and\n\n53\n00:02:09.658 --> 00:02:11.760\nit makes some meow noise.\n\n54\n00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.320\n&gt;&gt; You know we can make it happen somehow.\n\n55\n00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.102\n[LAUGH] Either we have to get into some\nmacro or something like that or VBA,\n\n56\n00:02:17.102 --> 00:02:18.840\nwe will make some sound effects.\n\n57\n00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.930\nNot in this episode.\n\n58\n00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.563\n&gt;&gt; This is more simplified.\n\n59\n00:02:22.563 --> 00:02:23.835\n&gt;&gt; Maybe we'll do a bonus episode.\n\n60\n00:02:23.835 --> 00:02:24.658\n&gt;&gt; Ooh!\n\n61\n00:02:24.658 --> 00:02:28.203\n&gt;&gt; And see it's like if they,\npeople take note is like I'm gonna\n\n62\n00:02:28.203 --> 00:02:32.988\ngo fine sound whatever I have made people,\nI'm gonna write in, ways to cat me out.\n\n63\n00:02:32.988 --> 00:02:35.946\n[LAUGH] I love that hey I hide\nan Easter egg right there.\n\n64\n00:02:35.946 --> 00:02:38.390\n&gt;&gt; That's right, find the Easter egg.\n\n65\n00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.062\n&gt;&gt; Even thought I'm telling\nyou exactly where it's at.\n\n66\n00:02:39.062 --> 00:02:41.310\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is in the series somewhere.\n\n67\n00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.030\nBut you don't know where yet.\n\n68\n00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.800\n&gt;&gt; Find the meow.\n\n69\n00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.340\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n70\n00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.980\n&gt;&gt; All right, so now we're just\ngonna find the ribbon, first of all.\n\n71\n00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.080\nSo we went over in our Windows,\nno, the Excel basics,\n\n72\n00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.980\nwe talked about the title bar.\n\n73\n00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.370\nSo that is definitely part of our\nExcel interface and environment.\n\n74\n00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.680\nSo we know that we are using\nthis particular file.\n\n75\n00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.050\nSo it's always good to\nconsult the title bar.\n\n76\n00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.240\nThere's a couple of other things over here\nthat look like they're in the title bar,\n\n77\n00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.230\nbut they're kind of not [LAUGH].\n\n78\n00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.580\nThey're there but they're not there.\n\n79\n00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.738\nSuch a profound statement\nright there [LAUGH].\n\n80\n00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:18.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So this guy over here,\n\n81\n00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.510\nthis is the quick access bar.\n\n82\n00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.770\nAnd we will talk about this\nparticular toolbar in just a second.\n\n83\n00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.272\nAnd then over here we have our minimize,\nmaximize or restore down, and close.\n\n84\n00:03:28.272 --> 00:03:32.782\nBut then these other buttons,\nthis is where it's telling us I'm\n\n85\n00:03:32.782 --> 00:03:36.969\nlogged into my Office 365\naccount as Justin Timberlake.\n\n86\n00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:38.940\nBecause that is the account that I have.\n\n87\n00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.590\nAnd then this button, this is something\nthat we will go over when we get to\n\n88\n00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.610\nthe ribbon,\nwhere is exactly where we're at now.\n\n89\n00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.250\nIt's right here, this whole big thing.\n\n90\n00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.236\nAcross the top of your environment\nis known as the ribbon.\n\n91\n00:03:54.236 --> 00:04:00.418\nAnd this ribbon has tabs across them,\nsuch as the insert, the page layout,\n\n92\n00:04:00.418 --> 00:04:05.265\nthe formulas, date,\nno that's not date, that's data.\n\n93\n00:04:05.265 --> 00:04:07.830\n[LAUGH], review and view.\n\n94\n00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.600\nSo to get to a specific tab on the ribbon\nyou single-click, do not double-click.\n\n95\n00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.810\nI'll show you why in a second.\n\n96\n00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.570\nIf I single-click on Formulas you can\nsee that I have all the different\n\n97\n00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.020\nthings that I would be doing for\nformulas and functions within Excel.\n\n98\n00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.040\nThis show does not cover anything\nabout formulas or functions.\n\n99\n00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.260\nThat's a whole separate show so definitely\ngo look in our course library for that.\n\n100\n00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.810\nBut these would be where we\nwould find the different named\n\n101\n00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.640\nfunction libraries such as text and\nlogical.\n\n102\n00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.320\nComing over to page layout, this is\nwhere you can get into your margins and\n\n103\n00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.390\nyour page breaks,\njust like we have in Word.\n\n104\n00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.400\nThere's a page layout tab in word,\nwe have a page layout tab in Excel.\n\n105\n00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.420\nBut there's a few other things that it\nwill have that are very Excel specific,\n\n106\n00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.470\nsuch as the grid lines and\nthe headings that we'll get into.\n\n107\n00:04:55.478 --> 00:04:58.180\nSo you single-click\nthe different tabs on the ribbon\n\n108\n00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.630\nto get to those different\ncommands that are in groups.\n\n109\n00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.270\nFor example on the Home tab,\nthere is a group called Font,\n\n110\n00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.860\nthere is a group called Alignment,\nNumber, so on and so forth.\n\n111\n00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.400\nSo that's one thing,\nif you start reading or\n\n112\n00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.460\nlooking at different things on\nthe internet about hey go into this group.\n\n113\n00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.560\nWell what's a group?\n\n114\n00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.140\nWell now you know, it's the bottom little\n\n115\n00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.470\ngroup title on the group, wow-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n116\n00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.209\n&gt;&gt; Even that circular reference again,\n\n117\n00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:29.217\nyou'll learn about-\n&gt;&gt; It's the group of the group,\n\n118\n00:05:29.217 --> 00:05:31.242\nwith the group, where they put\nthings together like a group?\n\n119\n00:05:31.242 --> 00:05:32.441\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's what I mean.\n\n120\n00:05:32.441 --> 00:05:37.098\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, and hopefully maybe\nyou'll discover my little pun there,\n\n121\n00:05:37.098 --> 00:05:38.810\nthe circular reference.\n\n122\n00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.370\nCuz that's actually something in Excel\nthat you do when yo do a formula that\n\n123\n00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.970\nbasically references itself,\nhey, I'm funny.\n\n124\n00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.712\nOkay, so\nwe've got all those different things here.\n\n125\n00:05:48.712 --> 00:05:53.626\nNow, on our groups on your ribbon\nsometimes you'll have this little button\n\n126\n00:05:53.626 --> 00:05:59.200\nover on the bottom right hand corner\nwhich is the dialog box launcher button.\n\n127\n00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.540\nJust way too long of a name.\n\n128\n00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that was a heck of\na title they got going on there.\n\n129\n00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:09.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I call it the more button\nbecause it takes you to more options.\n\n130\n00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.550\nI sometimes call it the old\nschool button because it-\n\n131\n00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:12.970\n&gt;&gt; It does look like an old school\n\n132\n00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:13.820\ndialog box.\n\n133\n00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that you would get from\nthe menu's back in 2002 or.\n\n134\n00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.340\n&gt;&gt; Probably before that.\n\n135\n00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.705\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think 2002 was the last version\nthat they had where they had menus.\n\n136\n00:06:22.705 --> 00:06:23.981\nWe talked about that in the other episode.\n\n137\n00:06:23.981 --> 00:06:25.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah true [INAUDIBLE].\n&gt;&gt; We are pretty sure it was 2003 when\n\n138\n00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.945\nthey started doing the ribbon.\n\n139\n00:06:26.945 --> 00:06:30.732\nAnd then I'm pretty sure,\nI think that was how long ago that was\n\n140\n00:06:30.732 --> 00:06:31.446\n[LAUGH]-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n141\n00:06:31.446 --> 00:06:31.951\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] So\n\n142\n00:06:31.951 --> 00:06:36.568\nwe have all of these different options\nhere in a dialog box and then you can hit\n\n143\n00:06:36.568 --> 00:06:40.558\nthe cancel or the x in that dialog\nbox to get it, to get out of that.\n\n144\n00:06:40.558 --> 00:06:47.390\nSo those are the more buttons on\nthe groups of your tabs of your ribbons.\n\n145\n00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.240\nWow, I followed that pretty good.\n\n146\n00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.272\n&gt;&gt; You did it.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I did it.\n\n147\n00:06:50.272 --> 00:06:51.087\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm proud of you there, kid.\n\n148\n00:06:51.087 --> 00:06:54.698\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So I said single-click on your\n\n149\n00:06:54.698 --> 00:07:00.170\ntabs because double-clicking does,\nwell, something else.\n\n150\n00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:05.090\nIf I double-click on another tab,\nclick click Well now I'll click it.\n\n151\n00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.902\nSometimes, what happens is I've\njust collapsed the ribbons.\n\n152\n00:07:08.902 --> 00:07:11.880\nSo double-clicking on your tabs is\nlike a short cut to doing that.\n\n153\n00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.980\nAnd I've had people do this and be like,\nI have no idea where all my buttons went.\n\n154\n00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.070\nBut then, it's kinda nice cuz it does give\nyou a little bit more real estate as you\n\n155\n00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:24.470\ncan see, but you single-click now,\nyou see how it kinda Hovers over it and\n\n156\n00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:28.020\nI single-click it again it\nkinda sucks back up in there.\n\n157\n00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.920\nBecause I've collapsed the ribbon.\n\n158\n00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:37.000\nNow, if you can double-click to collapse\nit you can double-click it to expand it.\n\n159\n00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.640\nSo you can see when I double-click\nit it comes back out.\n\n160\n00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.950\nOkay cool well I know that but\n\n161\n00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:44.210\nthere's a couple other ways\nin which you can get to it.\n\n162\n00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:48.180\nRemember I said there was this little\nbutton right here well now we're at it\n\n163\n00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.460\nit's the ribbon display options button.\n\n164\n00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:55.241\nWhen I click on this you can see there's\nthat auto hide ribbon, show tab,\n\n165\n00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:58.543\nshow tabs and commands so\nthere's different ones.\n\n166\n00:07:58.543 --> 00:08:02.313\nSo if I did the auto hide ribbon you see\nit's completely gone it's almost like\n\n167\n00:08:02.313 --> 00:08:03.763\nyou're in full screen mode.\n\n168\n00:08:03.763 --> 00:08:06.941\nIt's kind of like you do this, I think\na lot of people do this when they're\n\n169\n00:08:06.941 --> 00:08:10.326\nwatching videos or like the little button\non the bottom of your YouTube where it\n\n170\n00:08:10.326 --> 00:08:13.222\nexpands and shows full screen,\nit's pretty much the same thing.\n\n171\n00:08:13.222 --> 00:08:15.642\n&gt;&gt; Just getting some more\nreal estate out of the thing.\n\n172\n00:08:15.642 --> 00:08:18.102\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\nthen that's actually a virtual machine,\n\n173\n00:08:18.102 --> 00:08:20.059\nthat's not gonna come\nup on your guys stuff.\n\n174\n00:08:20.059 --> 00:08:21.120\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n175\n00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.897\n&gt;&gt; But now that I auto hide my stuff,\n\n176\n00:08:22.897 --> 00:08:26.580\ncuz I have other things that are auto\nhiding in my virtual machines and\n\n177\n00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.030\nthings like that.\n\n178\n00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:32.269\nSo you could see that if I click on this\nagain, there's this little dots over on\n\n179\n00:08:32.269 --> 00:08:36.337\nthe right-hand side, I can bring this\nup and then my button comes back up.\n\n180\n00:08:36.337 --> 00:08:40.195\nAnd then when I have is button,\nI can say show tabs and\n\n181\n00:08:40.195 --> 00:08:44.427\ncommands, cuz I like to see\nall of my options at all time.\n\n182\n00:08:44.427 --> 00:08:47.487\nSo you can see the different\noptions of the auto hide,\n\n183\n00:08:47.487 --> 00:08:50.691\nthe show tabs where we had done for\nthe double clicking.\n\n184\n00:08:50.691 --> 00:08:57.480\nAnd then the show tabs and\ncommands that has everything there.\n\n185\n00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.222\nAnd if you want yet another one,\n\n186\n00:08:59.222 --> 00:09:03.700\n[LAUGH] there's always like 15 different\nways to the same thing in these products.\n\n187\n00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:08.060\nYou can collapse the ribbon by that tiny\nlittle button over on the right-hand side,\n\n188\n00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.670\nand then it collapses it back down.\n\n189\n00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:12.700\nSo any which way you wanna get to,\n\n190\n00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:17.180\nhow you can control your ribbon,\nyou now know where they're at.\n\n191\n00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.090\n&gt;&gt; I'm waiting for Microsoft to\ncome out with an exam question,\n\n192\n00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:20.719\nwhere it says with the most\nadministrative effort.\n\n193\n00:09:20.719 --> 00:09:21.288\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n194\n00:09:21.288 --> 00:09:22.818\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Because they always love\n\n195\n00:09:22.818 --> 00:09:23.760\nthe least administrative effort.\n\n196\n00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.620\nBecause there are six different ways\nin which you could do something.\n\n197\n00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.002\nIf you're just gonna as me about\nthe easiest, why make the others?\n\n198\n00:09:29.002 --> 00:09:30.449\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n199\n00:09:30.449 --> 00:09:32.049\nI know, but it's options.\n\n200\n00:09:32.049 --> 00:09:32.604\n&gt;&gt; It is options.\n\n201\n00:09:32.604 --> 00:09:33.844\n&gt;&gt; Teach the ROM.\n\n202\n00:09:33.844 --> 00:09:34.933\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they are unnecessary.\n\n203\n00:09:34.933 --> 00:09:37.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They're spending money.\n\n204\n00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:40.657\nThey're paying coders to write ways\nin which they don't want you to use.\n\n205\n00:09:40.657 --> 00:09:43.652\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt;

Cuz it's not, it's a workbook.\n\n225\n00:10:29.012 --> 00:10:30.327\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n226\n00:10:30.327 --> 00:10:33.136\nI just finished filming Word for\nweeks on end.\n\n227\n00:10:33.136 --> 00:10:33.938\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt;

And\n\n243\n00:11:18.509 --> 00:11:21.778\nthen the description ever has nothing to\ndo with what you're actually experiencing,\n\n244\n00:11:21.778 --> 00:11:22.639\nthat's my favorite.\n\n245\n00:11:22.639 --> 00:11:27.280\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, those are really, really fun so.\n\n246\n00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.734\nAfter pressing enter move selection down,\n\n247\n00:11:29.734 --> 00:11:33.723\nwell that's been the way Excel has\nworked for me the beginning of time.\n\n248\n00:11:33.723 --> 00:11:40.969\nOr for some reason if that was like,\nokay, then it goes to up or to the right.\n\n249\n00:11:40.969 --> 00:11:43.354\nIt's like, what?\n\n250\n00:11:43.354 --> 00:11:44.292\n&gt;&gt; They're giving you options.\n\n251\n00:11:44.292 --> 00:11:46.539\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n252\n00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:47.339\nCome right back around.\n\n253\n00:11:47.339 --> 00:11:48.020\n&gt;&gt; Touche.\n\n254\n00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:48.559\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right.\nSo\n\n255\n00:11:48.559 --> 00:11:51.468\njust wanted to point that out\nwhere your Excel options are,\n\n256\n00:11:51.468 --> 00:11:53.836\nvery important to go through.\n\n257\n00:11:53.836 --> 00:11:57.829\nAll right, on our ribbon there will be\nsometimes you're going to get one of those\n\n258\n00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:58.778\ncontextual tabs.\n\n259\n00:11:58.778 --> 00:12:03.670\nContextual tabs are tabs in the ribbon\nthat only show up when you're selected\n\n260\n00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:05.107\non a particular item.\n\n261\n00:12:05.107 --> 00:12:09.851\nSuch as this cute adorable little cat,\nif I click on it noticed that I get\n\n262\n00:12:09.851 --> 00:12:13.345\na format tab on the ribbon\nwhich I had not had before.\n\n263\n00:12:13.345 --> 00:12:18.032\nBut that's because it is now that\nI've selected this item it's given\n\n264\n00:12:18.032 --> 00:12:22.173\nme that option, cuz this is why format for\nmy graphics tools.\n\n265\n00:12:22.173 --> 00:12:25.860\nThis is an icon, and so\nthat's why we have that particular one.\n\n266\n00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:28.490\nIf I click off of it\nthen the tab goes away.\n\n267\n00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:32.829\nSo those will come up as we start going\nthrough different things that we can add\n\n268\n00:12:32.829 --> 00:12:34.446\nwithin our Excel workbook.\n\n269\n00:12:34.446 --> 00:12:36.762\nI did it right [LAUGH].\n\n270\n00:12:36.762 --> 00:12:37.491\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n271\n00:12:37.491 --> 00:12:39.550\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Some other things that are in this\n\n272\n00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:44.718\nenvironment that are very Excel specific,\nlike you're not gonna find this in Word or\n\n273\n00:12:44.718 --> 00:12:47.474\nPowerPoint is this guy\nright across the top.\n\n274\n00:12:47.474 --> 00:12:49.582\nThis is the formula bar.\n\n275\n00:12:49.582 --> 00:12:54.524\nNow the formula bar is where you're\ngoing to be seeing the information of\n\n276\n00:12:54.524 --> 00:12:57.090\nwhat's in the particular cell.\n\n277\n00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:00.460\nThis could be now, it says formula bar,\nnow why does it say formula bar?\n\n278\n00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:02.100\nI'm gonna give you a quick example.\n\n279\n00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:08.020\nSo if I click right here, notice that\ndoes not say $140.13 now does it Daniel?\n\n280\n00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:08.630\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n281\n00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:10.690\n&gt;&gt; No,\nit says I have no idea what that says.\n\n282\n00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:12.005\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n283\n00:13:12.005 --> 00:13:13.003\n&gt;&gt; That's the formula.\n\n284\n00:13:13.003 --> 00:13:14.200\n&gt;&gt; That's the formula bar?\n\n285\n00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:14.932\nIt says some weird stuff.\n\n286\n00:13:14.932 --> 00:13:17.075\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Some,\n\n287\n00:13:17.075 --> 00:13:19.080\nI assume there's some\nadding that occurring.\n\n288\n00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.720\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You are correct.\n\n289\n00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:24.467\nYes, that is adding up these cell\nreferences of B6 through B9.\n\n290\n00:13:24.467 --> 00:13:25.461\n&gt;&gt; I came up with a new term,\na hypothassume.\n\n291\n00:13:25.461 --> 00:13:28.044\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's me.\n\n292\n00:13:28.044 --> 00:13:29.467\nThat's a D Lowrie.\n\n293\n00:13:29.467 --> 00:13:30.458\n&gt;&gt; I love it.\n\n294\n00:13:30.458 --> 00:13:31.939\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n295\n00:13:31.939 --> 00:13:33.413\n&gt;&gt; That's almost like a Vonne-ism.\n\n296\n00:13:33.413 --> 00:13:35.032\n&gt;&gt; I know, it's great stuff.\n\n297\n00:13:35.032 --> 00:13:36.415\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, you've been working\nwith me too much haven't you?\n\n298\n00:13:36.415 --> 00:13:40.853\n[LAUGH] So you can see that the formula\nbar is where you're going to display\n\n299\n00:13:40.853 --> 00:13:42.757\nthe particular information.\n\n300\n00:13:42.757 --> 00:13:44.967\nThis does say Christmas Cats Weekly Sales.\n\n301\n00:13:44.967 --> 00:13:48.731\nNow we're gonna get into selecting\ninformation and everything.\n\n302\n00:13:48.731 --> 00:13:51.838\nBut right now we're just gonna\ngo in over the environment, so\n\n303\n00:13:51.838 --> 00:13:55.084\nI wanted to show you what the formula\nbar does and where it's at.\n\n304\n00:13:55.084 --> 00:13:59.280\nYou will also have this\nover which is the name box.\n\n305\n00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:03.790\nThe name box is going to give\nyou the name of the cell or\n\n306\n00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:06.740\nis also known as the cell\nreference as to where you are.\n\n307\n00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:10.287\nFor example, if I click out here,\nit tells me that I'm on cell L5.\n\n308\n00:14:10.287 --> 00:14:12.827\nI know that, because of the name box.\n\n309\n00:14:12.827 --> 00:14:14.914\nNow there's a dropdown next to here.\n\n310\n00:14:14.914 --> 00:14:21.007\nI'm gonna drop this down, now you might\nnot ever see named values within here.\n\n311\n00:14:21.007 --> 00:14:25.593\nThat's because if you don't see them, you\ndon't have what are known as named ranges.\n\n312\n00:14:25.593 --> 00:14:30.332\nYou can name ranges of cells and\nuse them for navigating to\n\n313\n00:14:30.332 --> 00:14:35.664\nspecific areas like,\nif I go to daily totals versus addresses,\n\n314\n00:14:35.664 --> 00:14:41.440\nyou see you just jump all the way\nover to another place in my workbook.\n\n315\n00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:44.979\nSo that's a really handy\nway to start navigating.\n\n316\n00:14:44.979 --> 00:14:46.532\nHow do you make them?\n\n317\n00:14:46.532 --> 00:14:49.634\nI'll show you in another episode,\nbut just right now,\n\n318\n00:14:49.634 --> 00:14:52.277\nthis is our environment\nof this is the name box.\n\n319\n00:14:52.277 --> 00:14:55.470\nSo that is its real name,\nthat's its actual name,\n\n320\n00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:57.785\nnot a Vonne-ism before I made it up.\n\n321\n00:14:57.785 --> 00:14:59.037\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n322\n00:14:59.037 --> 00:15:00.225\n&gt;&gt; All right, what else do we have?\n\n323\n00:15:00.225 --> 00:15:04.890\nWe have the Quick Access Toolbar,\nwhich is all the way up here.\n\n324\n00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:07.780\nThe Quick Access Toolbar is\nwhere you can put commands so\n\n325\n00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:13.220\nyou can easily access them, because if\nI wanted to go over to insert image,\n\n326\n00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.220\nI have to go to the insert tab,\n\n327\n00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:20.370\ngo over to illustrations and then drop\nthis down to get into insert pictures.\n\n328\n00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:23.480\nBut if it's something that I'm gonna be\nusing all the time, I don't wanna have to\n\n329\n00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:28.270\nremember, go to the review tab, go over\nto spell check, go back over to home.\n\n330\n00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.220\nI have to get to all\nthese different places,\n\n331\n00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:34.010\njust add them up there the quick\naccess toolbar doesn't change.\n\n332\n00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:37.088\nThat will always stay up no matter\nwhere you are in the ribbon, so\n\n333\n00:15:37.088 --> 00:15:39.884\nyou can go ahead and\nstart loading your commands in there.\n\n334\n00:15:39.884 --> 00:15:44.464\nNow I only have the save, the undo,\nand the redo are very best friends.\n\n335\n00:15:44.464 --> 00:15:46.165\nAnd then I have the customize or\n\n336\n00:15:46.165 --> 00:15:50.428\nthe drop down next to it that allows me\nto customize the Quick Access Toolbar.\n\n337\n00:15:50.428 --> 00:15:55.097\n&gt;&gt; How many Quick Access options can\nwe have in our Quick Access Toolbar?\n\n338\n00:15:55.097 --> 00:15:58.623\n&gt;&gt; As soon as you said that,\nI wanna say it's 255.\n\n339\n00:15:58.623 --> 00:15:59.225\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH] Probably as much as\nyour real estate allow you.\n\n362\n00:16:47.538 --> 00:16:48.738\n&gt;&gt; That's what I would think.\n\n363\n00:16:48.738 --> 00:16:49.602\n&gt;&gt; We'll go with that.\n\n364\n00:16:49.602 --> 00:16:53.850\n[LAUGH] So you can see that if I\ngo over here to, there's spelling,\n\n365\n00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:56.980\nright here, and\nthe most commonly used ones.\n\n366\n00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:58.020\nAll right, that's pretty neat.\n\n367\n00:16:58.020 --> 00:16:59.680\nAnd then I can do a print preview.\n\n368\n00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.810\nSo I can go ahead and\ndo that instead of doing Ctrl+P.\n\n369\n00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:03.660\nSo on and so forth.\n\n370\n00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:06.470\nBut there's no insert image in here.\n\n371\n00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:10.690\nSo if I wanna get into commands that are\nnot just right in this area, I can go to\n\n372\n00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:15.310\nmore commands and then come into my Excel\noptions, which is another place where you\n\n373\n00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:20.150\ncan get to, and then you have to\nfind where that command is located.\n\n374\n00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:25.360\nWell, I know the insert image is on\nthe insert tab, so going up here on\n\n375\n00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:30.300\nthe left hand side, of choosing from the\nspecific area where that command is, and\n\n376\n00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:34.500\nthen finding it within that space,\nthat's where I could find,\n\n377\n00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:38.820\nthere is insert image somewhere in here.\n\n378\n00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:43.881\nWell, we're gonna go with insert icons\nbecause it's all I can see right now.\n\n379\n00:17:43.881 --> 00:17:44.390\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n380\n00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:45.830\n&gt;&gt; So you can see I can add\n\n381\n00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:48.059\nthat on over there, so.\n&gt;&gt; There's insert pictures,\n\n382\n00:17:48.059 --> 00:17:49.620\nit's like three down.\n&gt;&gt;

They're called synonyms,\n[LAUGH] it's fun.\n\n389\n00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:06.010\n&gt;&gt; They [LAUGH] are,\nthere goes that English language again.\n\n390\n00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:09.720\n&gt;&gt; It's like when I jumped into a Mac and\nI started using a Mac I kept looking for\n\n391\n00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:13.650\ncertain things like file\ndelete not in a Mac.\n\n392\n00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:17.060\nYou can't right click and look for\ndelete it's moved to trash.\n\n393\n00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:20.070\nTo this day I've been using a Mac for\nalmost three years now to this day I look\n\n394\n00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:24.560\nfor right click, delete it's not there\nafter all it's moved to trash you moron.\n\n395\n00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.349\n&gt;&gt; I know especially with us having\nto go back and forth with all of our\n\n396\n00:18:27.349 --> 00:18:30.763\noperating systems and you've thrown Lennox\non there on top of it I don't know.\n\n397\n00:18:30.763 --> 00:18:31.995\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n398\n00:18:31.995 --> 00:18:34.500\nnow this is in that drop down.\n\n399\n00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:38.520\nBut do you see where it says, show\nquick access toolbar below the ribbon?\n\n400\n00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:42.480\nLet's check that off, and hm,\nI wonder what that's gonna do?\n\n401\n00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.560\nIt's gonna show it below the ribbon.\n\n402\n00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.070\n&gt;&gt; Below the ribbon.\n\n403\n00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:45.772\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It´s a little bit closer, so\n\n404\n00:18:45.772 --> 00:18:49.075\nif you want and that's where it´s how\nmany you want, or how many can you have.\n\n405\n00:18:49.075 --> 00:18:50.795\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It´s probably up until you see it,\n\n406\n00:18:50.795 --> 00:18:53.499\nI have never\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes when you get to the edge of\n\n407\n00:18:53.499 --> 00:18:57.038\nthe screen or whatever, they´ll give you a\nlittle drop down so you can and then it'll\n\n408\n00:18:57.038 --> 00:19:00.260\njust hide what can't be shown and what\nreal estate you have available to you.\n\n409\n00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:01.702\nSo, maybe that's what it would do.\n\n410\n00:19:01.702 --> 00:19:03.980\nWe would have to test\nthose waters to find out.\n\n411\n00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:04.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Feel free.\n\n412\n00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:07.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nIt might take us quite awhile to get\n\n413\n00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:09.660\nthere, so we're gonna go with that.\n\n414\n00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:10.630\nSo perfect.\n\n415\n00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:14.350\nOne quick one I wanted to show\nyou was this Touch Mouse Mode.\n\n416\n00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:17.340\nIf you're on a Windows operating, or\nreally just a computer that allows for\n\n417\n00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:18.710\ntouch screens, right?\n\n418\n00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:23.040\nThis is kind of an interesting one here\nbecause right now it is in Mouse Mode\n\n419\n00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.460\nto where everything's on a mouse.\n\n420\n00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:26.775\nYou have a lot more\ncontrol if you wanna say,\n\n421\n00:19:26.775 --> 00:19:29.430\nbecause it's just one little\npointer clicking on the buttons.\n\n422\n00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:33.040\nBut on a touch screen, especially if\nyou've got bigger fingers, you hit one,\n\n423\n00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.390\nit hits like three different\nbuttons at the same time?\n\n424\n00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:38.940\nWhen you go to touch mode do you see\nhow everything gets a lot bigger?\n\n425\n00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:39.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; On the ribbon?\n\n426\n00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:41.456\nI thought that was pretty cool so\n\n427\n00:19:41.456 --> 00:19:44.474\nif I go back to mouse you see how\neverything gets a lot smaller.\n\n428\n00:19:44.474 --> 00:19:49.365\nSo it's just one of those features that if\nyou are like I said on a touch monitor it\n\n429\n00:19:49.365 --> 00:19:53.526\nmight be better to throw that in\nthere on the quick access toolbar and\n\n430\n00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:56.756\nchanging your options there so,\nkind of fun stuff.\n\n431\n00:19:56.756 --> 00:20:01.544\nAnother thing I just threw something in,\nyour ribbon is dynamic in\n\n432\n00:20:01.544 --> 00:20:06.940\nthe sense that depending on your real\nestate it changes for example watch.\n\n433\n00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.250\nWhen I restore down here, do you see it?\n\n434\n00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:11.066\nNow do you see how everything kind of.\n\n435\n00:20:11.066 --> 00:20:12.266\n&gt;&gt; Squishes?\n&gt;&gt; Squishes.\n\n436\n00:20:12.266 --> 00:20:15.273\nSquishes, yeah perfect you\nhave been with me too long.\n\n437\n00:20:15.273 --> 00:20:16.031\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But\n\n438\n00:20:16.031 --> 00:20:20.850\nyou see as I am start making it more\nthan I have the different, okay,\n\n439\n00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:22.490\nsee where it says cells right there?\n\n440\n00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:27.330\nIf I move that out, that starts to\nactually show me the insert, delete,\n\n441\n00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:28.360\nand format and so on and so forth.\n\n442\n00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.080\n&gt;&gt; The scales,\naccording to what size you give it.\n\n443\n00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:34.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, to whatever your monitor\nresolution is or the size of your monitor.\n\n444\n00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:34.880\nBoth of them.\n\n445\n00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:38.280\nSo, that's where yours might look\na little different than mine.\n\n446\n00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:42.110\nYou might not have the words next to wrap\ntext, you might just have the icon, or\n\n447\n00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:45.850\nmaybe you have even more stuff you can\nsee, a whole bunch of the cell styles\n\n448\n00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:50.190\nbecause your monitor and\nscreen resolution allows that.\n\n449\n00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:51.850\nSo, I just wanted to throw that in.\n\n450\n00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:55.430\nAll right, last few things that\nwe have in our environment.\n\n451\n00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:58.440\nWe've gone up on the top\nlet's go down to the bottom,\n\n452\n00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.730\ndown here all the way down here.\n\n453\n00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:03.120\nThis is where we have our status bar.\n\n454\n00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:07.200\nThe status bar, hm,\ngives us status of what we're looking at.\n\n455\n00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:10.050\nNow if I'm out here in\nnothing that's just going,\n\n456\n00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:12.730\nsee there's nothing really across here,\njust says ready.\n\n457\n00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:13.720\nAnd so on and so forth.\n\n458\n00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:14.730\nAnd on that status bar,\n\n459\n00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:17.960\nyou also have these buttons over on\nthe right, which will change your views.\n\n460\n00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.240\nI'm not gonna click them right now.\n\n461\n00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.920\nThere's a specific reason why not, but\n\n462\n00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:26.060\nyou'll get to that when we get into\nour navigating within a document.\n\n463\n00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:30.380\nAnd our zoom over here, but the status\nbar doesn't really show much, but\n\n464\n00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:31.810\nunless I actually click on something,\n\n465\n00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:35.240\nlike for example, let me show you\nif we go to our weekly totals.\n\n466\n00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.020\nNow notice here, no that's the wrong one.\n\n467\n00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:38.620\nHow about we go with daily totals,\nthere we go.\n\n468\n00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:42.570\nYou see down at the bottom I have\nsome pretty cool things that happens,\n\n469\n00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:44.850\nwhen I'm selecting ranges of cells?\n\n470\n00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:49.690\nIt will give me a quick status of and\nalso some of these basic\n\n471\n00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:53.030\nfunctions that you can have in excel,\nfunctions, formulas,\n\n472\n00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:57.040\npretty much the same things, so functions\nare formulas, formulas are functions.\n\n473\n00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:01.960\nThey average of our daily totals,\nthe count, the sum of everything.\n\n474\n00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:05.180\nSo there's some pretty neat things\nthat you can do really quickly\n\n475\n00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:08.840\nby just looking down at the status bar.\n\n476\n00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:12.420\nFor example, if I selected,\nsay, this right here,\n\n477\n00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:16.880\nnotice over here it says count of eight,\nnow, it's not doing a sum because\n\n478\n00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:20.760\nit's seeing that this is actual text and\nyou can't really add text together.\n\n479\n00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:25.920\nSo, I like the status bar, it shows me a\ncouple neat things that are down in there.\n\n480\n00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.808\nNow, now you can always customize\nthe status bar if you wanted to.\n\n481\n00:22:28.808 --> 00:22:33.990\nIf you right-click anywhere in the status\nbar you have all the different\n\n482\n00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:39.550\nthings that it will allow or\nbe able to show you on that status bar.\n\n483\n00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:44.870\nSo if you didn't like it doing the sum in\nthe status bar, you can turn that off.\n\n484\n00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:46.980\nSo you can check offs on or off for\n\n485\n00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:50.090\ndifferent things that you want\nto have in that status bar.\n\n486\n00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:52.200\nAnd so that's kind of a fun little thing.\n\n487\n00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.600\nAnd the status bar, this is the same\nin all of your other Office programs,\n\n488\n00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:57.500\nlike in Word it showed us the word\ncount in our sections and\n\n489\n00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.610\nI was like always look at the status bar.\n\n490\n00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:02.345\nGonna say the same thing in Excel,\nalways look at your status bar,\n\n491\n00:23:02.345 --> 00:23:07.424\nbecause it'll give you\nthe status of what you're doing.\n\n492\n00:23:07.424 --> 00:23:08.627\n&gt;&gt;

It's spinning blue Cheerio.\n\n510\n00:23:53.533 --> 00:23:55.590\n&gt;&gt; There we go\n&gt;&gt; Well, you know what?\n\n511\n00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:56.520\nThat's not really helpful.\n\n512\n00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.160\nIt's not really telling me about\nhow to actually do a table.\n\n513\n00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.450\nSo that's okay.\n\n514\n00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:03.850\nIf it doesn't do that, you can always\ngo out to the Microsoft Online and\n\n515\n00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:06.900\nthat's where you can really\nfind some good stuff in there.\n\n516\n00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:10.770\nAnd so that's about everything\nthat I think I can cover\n\n517\n00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:12.150\nin the excel environment.\n\n518\n00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:15.960\nWe've got our ribbon, status bar,\ninsert bar, everything is ready to go.\n\n519\n00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.128\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Vonne,\n\n520\n00:24:17.128 --> 00:24:20.646\nthat's a really good look at the\nnavigationaling around inside of Excel.\n\n521\n00:24:20.646 --> 00:24:23.242\nThat's right, I've been listening\nto Vonne for far too long.\n\n522\n00:24:23.242 --> 00:24:24.021\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I love it.\n\n523\n00:24:24.021 --> 00:24:26.623\n&gt;&gt; So follow us, just come with us,\nfall down the rabbit hole with us.\n\n524\n00:24:26.623 --> 00:24:28.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's going to be a lot of fun.\n\n525\n00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.590\nThanks for watching so much.\n\n526\n00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:32.560\nIt does look like it's time for\nus to sign off.\n\n527\n00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.800\nFor Office Pro TV I've been\nyour host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n528\n00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:35.750\n&gt;&gt;

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.400\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode, well,\n\n4\n00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.450\nI hope you're excited because I sure am.\n\n5\n00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.070\n&gt;&gt; We're back with more in our\nExcel 2016 Essential Series.\n\n6\n00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.260\nIt's been a lot of fun so far.\n\n7\n00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.520\nAnd joining us back in the studio,\nour good friend, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.610\nVonne, we're glad to have you again.\n\n9\n00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:26.440\nHow's it going today?\n\n10\n00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.991\n&gt;&gt; It's fantastic.\n\n11\n00:00:26.991 --> 00:00:30.494\nI'm ready to navigate the Excel waters.\n\n12\n00:00:30.494 --> 00:00:32.224\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and show you how to.\n\n13\n00:00:32.224 --> 00:00:33.036\n&gt;&gt; Sounds dangerous.\n\n14\n00:00:33.036 --> 00:00:35.837\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well I'm gonna make it less dangerous\n\n15\n00:00:35.837 --> 00:00:36.522\nfor everybody.\n\n16\n00:00:36.522 --> 00:00:37.103\n&gt;&gt; That's good.\n\n17\n00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:41.548\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna show you how to do it, and\nall sorts of fun little ways that we can\n\n18\n00:00:41.548 --> 00:00:46.160\nmake little short cuts to make our\ntravels a little less strenuous.\n\n19\n00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.680\n&gt;&gt; Arduous.\n\n20\n00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.560\n&gt;&gt; Arduous, yes, strenuous.\n\n21\n00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.152\n&gt;&gt; Word of the day calendar.\n\n22\n00:00:50.152 --> 00:00:52.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\n\n23\n00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.940\nGRE preps.\n\n24\n00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.413\nYes, so we're going to make it a little\nbit easier for us to get around, and\n\n25\n00:00:57.413 --> 00:00:59.920\nI'm gonna show all sorts of short cuts.\n\n26\n00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.357\nSo, why don't we get started right\naway in our navigate a workbook file,\n\n27\n00:01:05.357 --> 00:01:08.602\nour navigate a workbook workbook, [LAUGH],\n\n28\n00:01:08.602 --> 00:01:12.620\nthat I already have opened on our screen,\nall right.\n\n29\n00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.760\nSo this is one of those basic basics,\n\n30\n00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.750\nfoundations that probably\na lot of people skip over.\n\n31\n00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.535\nSo then these are some of my\nfavorite episodes to go over.\n\n32\n00:01:21.535 --> 00:01:25.007\nBecause it's like you said,\nyou might have already known it, but\n\n33\n00:01:25.007 --> 00:01:27.179\nnow you know it better or\nnow you know why.\n\n34\n00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:29.460\nOr, that's what that was doing?\n\n35\n00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.710\nSo it's kinda fun to have those aha\nmoments that everybody like to do,\n\n36\n00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.830\nespecially with something so basic.\n\n37\n00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:37.768\nYou're a genius!\n\n38\n00:01:37.768 --> 00:01:38.690\nI'm like, thanks.\n\n39\n00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.589\n&gt;&gt; You know what it is is\nyou ever asked somebody,\n\n40\n00:01:40.589 --> 00:01:43.429\nthey're doing something complex and\nyou know a little but about it.\n\n41\n00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:47.155\nAnd then you go now why do you do that,\nand they go because that's how it works.\n\n42\n00:01:47.155 --> 00:01:54.760\nI understand that part but\nwhy are we doing that to make it work.\n\n43\n00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.918\n&gt;&gt; I also think that's also\npart of your personality.\n\n44\n00:01:57.918 --> 00:01:59.979\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because I heard you in the other room\n\n45\n00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.041\nsaying, well no, you've given me\nthe information but why, tell me why,\n\n46\n00:02:03.041 --> 00:02:03.978\njust get to the point.\n\n47\n00:02:03.978 --> 00:02:05.847\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, and\n\n48\n00:02:05.847 --> 00:02:08.185\nwe kind of go along the same way so.\n\n49\n00:02:08.185 --> 00:02:11.660\n[LAUGH] So, when we first start out\nin Excel of navigating a document,\n\n50\n00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.180\nbefore I say Just click here,\n\n51\n00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.290\njust do that, just do that,\nit's all about the mouse cursor icons.\n\n52\n00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.690\nI mean, this is in all of our programs.\n\n53\n00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:21.900\nI've talked about this in Word.\n\n54\n00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.570\nI've talked about this in PowerPoint,\neven Outlook and Excel.\n\n55\n00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.680\nIt's the same premise.\n\n56\n00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.070\nYou really need to slow down,\ntake a breath, look at what you're doing.\n\n57\n00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.570\nWhat do I see?\n\n58\n00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.080\nCuz what you see is what's\ngonna happen type thing.\n\n59\n00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.990\nOur mouse cursor icons like\nwhen I move my mouse around.\n\n60\n00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.140\n&gt;&gt; You mean the little pointer\nthat's floating across the screen?\n\n61\n00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.253\n&gt;&gt; Yes, correct.\n\n62\n00:02:45.253 --> 00:02:50.153\nAnd that mouse pointer icon will\nchange depending on where you're at.\n\n63\n00:02:50.153 --> 00:02:54.478\nNow, in Excel, when you're just kinda\nall over in this place right here,\n\n64\n00:02:54.478 --> 00:02:57.090\nyou see what I call\nthe big white plus sign.\n\n65\n00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.360\nIt's the white plus sign.\n\n66\n00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.902\n&gt;&gt; That's very descriptive.\n\n67\n00:02:58.902 --> 00:03:00.196\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or\n\n68\n00:03:00.196 --> 00:03:04.277\nyou can even say the white cross,\nwhichever way you want to describe that.\n\n69\n00:03:04.277 --> 00:03:09.410\nSo this is the cell selector\nmouse pointer icon.\n\n70\n00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.880\nIf you're going to click right now,\nyou will be selecting a cell.\n\n71\n00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.040\nThat's exactly what you need to look for.\n\n72\n00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.710\nNow, when I see this down here, I'm just\ngonna kinda circle my mouse around it\n\n73\n00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.960\nbecause I don't wanna hover my mouse over\nit cuz then I'm gonna get different icons.\n\n74\n00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.103\nWhen you see a cell, because I\nguess we should probably back up.\n\n75\n00:03:28.103 --> 00:03:28.648\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what's a cell?\n\n76\n00:03:28.648 --> 00:03:30.383\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I just realized, I'm like,\n\n77\n00:03:30.383 --> 00:03:31.110\nI should back up here.\n\n78\n00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.500\nSo Excel is a workbook and\n\n79\n00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.148\nI think we've actually talked about this\nin our introductions, or the intro one.\n\n80\n00:03:37.148 --> 00:03:41.747\nBut right here, where columns and\nrows intersect,\n\n81\n00:03:41.747 --> 00:03:46.670\nis a cell, and\nthat's what a spreadsheet is all about.\n\n82\n00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.128\nIt's in a grid-like tabular fashion,\nin that where we have our columns and\n\n83\n00:03:51.128 --> 00:03:51.764\nour rows.\n\n84\n00:03:51.764 --> 00:03:54.760\nAnd our columns and our rows are labeled.\n\n85\n00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.422\nWe have our column headers up here,\n\n86\n00:03:57.422 --> 00:04:00.810\nwe have our row numbers\nover here to the left.\n\n87\n00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.760\nAnd when you're on a cell,\nyou now have a active cell.\n\n88\n00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.200\nThe reason I know this is\nan active cell is cuz that gray,\n\n89\n00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.330\nthat's not gray, that's green.\n\n90\n00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.940\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The green box\n\n91\n00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.970\naround that cell indicates that that is\nmy selected cell, that is my active cell.\n\n92\n00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.240\nDot the borders, and\nalso notice that up in our column and\n\n93\n00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:29.690\nour row references, it's highlighted and\nunderlined as well.\n\n94\n00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.510\nAnd so that's also where\nyou get the cell reference.\n\n95\n00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.420\nThis is cell F15.\n\n96\n00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.487\nYou always start with your column,\nand then your row, and\n\n97\n00:04:38.487 --> 00:04:42.150\nthat's where I am at,\nthat's my active cell.\n\n98\n00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.050\nThe cell should shows up\nin the name box over here.\n\n99\n00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.000\nThere's the name box\nthat this is cell F15.\n\n100\n00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.742\nCool, so now we know that.\n\n101\n00:04:50.742 --> 00:04:52.270\nAll those mouse pointer icons,\n\n102\n00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.060\nyou probably even saw a couple\nwhen I hovered over F.\n\n103\n00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.990\nWhen I come up to my column, you see\nthat this is where it turns into a black\n\n104\n00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.980\narrow pointing down, versus this icon.\n\n105\n00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.453\nLet me zoom back out,\nlet me come over to my rows.\n\n106\n00:05:07.453 --> 00:05:10.455\nYou see how if, it's kinda going\noff the screen a little bit.\n\n107\n00:05:10.455 --> 00:05:15.185\nI have a black arrow pointing to\nthe right, versus the two lines,\n\n108\n00:05:15.185 --> 00:05:18.180\nthe lines and the two arrows on there.\n\n109\n00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.291\nSo those are all different mouse\ncursor icons that do different things,\n\n110\n00:05:21.291 --> 00:05:22.721\nsuch as changing the row height.\n\n111\n00:05:22.721 --> 00:05:28.050\nSelecting the row, selecting the column,\nchanging the column width.\n\n112\n00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.310\nSo more episodes on that where we\nwill cover how to actually do that.\n\n113\n00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.639\nSo coming down into our active cell,\nif I hover my mouse over the edge\n\n114\n00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:43.267\nof the active cell, then you're going\nto get the four pointed arrows.\n\n115\n00:05:43.267 --> 00:05:46.279\nThe four pointed arrows will always,\nalways always,\n\n116\n00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:49.753\nwell there's that asterisk thing\nwe were just talking about.\n\n117\n00:05:49.753 --> 00:05:52.066\nI'm always scared of making\nthings in absolutes, but\n\n118\n00:05:52.066 --> 00:05:53.433\nI'm gonna go with it this time.\n\n119\n00:05:53.433 --> 00:05:55.592\nFour pointed arrows\nare always gonna mean move.\n\n120\n00:05:55.592 --> 00:05:59.412\nI will be moving the contents of whatever\nis in that cell to another place.\n\n121\n00:05:59.412 --> 00:06:04.465\nIf I move over to the very bottom\nright hand corner of an active cell,\n\n122\n00:06:04.465 --> 00:06:07.134\nyou get the little black plus sign.\n\n123\n00:06:07.134 --> 00:06:12.130\nSo you have the big white plus sign and\nthen you have the little black plus sign.\n\n124\n00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.319\nWhen you see that, that is the what's\ntechnically known as a fill handle that\n\n125\n00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:18.967\nwill be doing something\nwhen you pull this down.\n\n126\n00:06:18.967 --> 00:06:22.969\nLike click, hold, and drag down or across,\nit's gonna do something completely\n\n127\n00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:26.240\ndifferent than if you're here,\nor if you're here.\n\n128\n00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.150\nSo, all of those mouse cursor icons are\nall right in this tiny little vicinity.\n\n129\n00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.720\nAnd you need to be very\ncareful about where you are,\n\n130\n00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.470\nwhat does the cursor look like,\nbefore you do something, okay?\n\n131\n00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.940\nBecause if I have that big white\nplus sign and I single-click,\n\n132\n00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.610\nI have now selected that cell.\n\n133\n00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:49.140\nThis has become my active\ncell versus moving it.\n\n134\n00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.798\nAnd you can see I don't have any content\nin there, so you can just kinda see it.\n\n135\n00:06:51.798 --> 00:06:57.220\nIf there was something, it would now\ngo there versus dragging this down,\n\n136\n00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.937\nwhich would do something separate.\n\n137\n00:06:59.937 --> 00:07:03.825\nI'll tell you what those are later\n[LAUGH], right now we're just talking\n\n138\n00:07:03.825 --> 00:07:08.470\nabout navigating the document and getting\nfamiliar with those mouse cursor icons.\n\n139\n00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:13.710\nSo very important to differentiate\nthose different items.\n\n140\n00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:15.870\nSo, as we said, this is our active cell.\n\n141\n00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.374\nSo if I say, okay,\nI'd like you to select cell D4.\n\n142\n00:07:19.374 --> 00:07:26.930\nOkay, D, there's column,\nrow 4, that is cell D4.\n\n143\n00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.363\nIf I say click on I3, I 3.\n\n144\n00:07:30.363 --> 00:07:32.697\nWhat if I say K10?\n\n145\n00:07:32.697 --> 00:07:35.507\nOkay, oops, that's 11,\nwell, let me go to 10.\n\n146\n00:07:35.507 --> 00:07:39.161\nIf you get the idea here of\ntaking your references and\n\n147\n00:07:39.161 --> 00:07:41.579\nthen selecting that active cell.\n\n148\n00:07:41.579 --> 00:07:46.554\nCool, so now we know how I can\nnavigate to select specific cell\n\n149\n00:07:46.554 --> 00:07:49.146\nreferences that I need to go to.\n\n150\n00:07:49.146 --> 00:07:53.443\nNow we're in a worksheet of a workbook.\n\n151\n00:07:53.443 --> 00:07:55.459\nWe've talked about that before in Excel,\n\n152\n00:07:55.459 --> 00:07:57.819\nwe're always talking about\nfiles as a workbook.\n\n153\n00:07:57.819 --> 00:08:01.460\nThat are collected of sheets,\nkind of like a book has pages in it.\n\n154\n00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.440\nSo our sheets are like our pages.\n\n155\n00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.920\nAnd each one of these,\nyou have your scrolls.\n\n156\n00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.790\nIf I need to scroll down,\nyou come over to the right hand side,\n\n157\n00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:14.540\nyou can click hold and\ndrag this scroll down.\n\n158\n00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.050\nAnd you can see that it's showing you what\n\n159\n00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:21.330\nrow are we in right there with\nthat hovering little tool tip.\n\n160\n00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.920\nYou also have the little bumpy buttons.\n\n161\n00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.230\nSo behind my head, we've got the little\nbutton down here where I can just go ahead\n\n162\n00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:32.630\nand click, click, click, and just kinda\njump down a little bit at a time.\n\n163\n00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:37.150\nYou also then have a horizontal scroll\ndown here to where if I needed to move\n\n164\n00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.470\nover, into my worksheet.\n\n165\n00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:42.540\nI can click, click or drag this back and\n\n166\n00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:46.580\nforth to get to the specific\nplaces that I want.\n\n167\n00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:50.100\nSo, scrolls, always good,\nand the scroll bars.\n\n168\n00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.560\nNow I tend to be a scrolly wheel person.\n\n169\n00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:57.280\n[LAUGH] Well, actually on this mouse\nright here, I don't have a scrolly wheel.\n\n170\n00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.587\n&gt;&gt; It's like-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n171\n00:08:58.587 --> 00:09:00.601\n&gt;&gt; It mimics a scroll-y wheel, right?\n\n172\n00:09:00.601 --> 00:09:01.429\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You just move your finger.\n\n173\n00:09:01.429 --> 00:09:03.410\n&gt;&gt; See?\nI don't know how many of you are, well,\n\n174\n00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:06.157\nsince I'm teaching 2016 for\nWindows, [LAUGH].\n\n175\n00:09:06.157 --> 00:09:06.876\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n176\n00:09:06.876 --> 00:09:08.084\n&gt;&gt; You probably won't have a magic mouse.\n\n177\n00:09:08.084 --> 00:09:09.132\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Most likely, I mean,\n\n178\n00:09:09.132 --> 00:09:11.121\nyou could be running boot camp,\nor something like that.\n\n179\n00:09:11.121 --> 00:09:12.509\n&gt;&gt; It is an Apple product, so.\n\n180\n00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:13.453\n&gt;&gt; It is an Apple product.\n\n181\n00:09:13.453 --> 00:09:18.820\n&gt;&gt; I'm like, I don't even know if they\nmake anything like this in not Apple.\n\n182\n00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:19.520\nI'm sure.\n&gt;&gt; They do.\n\n183\n00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.200\n&gt;&gt; I never look for it.\n\n184\n00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.060\n&gt;&gt; Typically,\ncuz you've got people coming from Mac,\n\n185\n00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.770\ngoing to Windows PC based kind of thing.\n\n186\n00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:26.222\nSo they want some familiarity, so\n\n187\n00:09:26.222 --> 00:09:28.438\nI wouldn't be surprised to\nsee a product out there.\n\n188\n00:09:28.438 --> 00:09:32.351\n&gt;&gt; There's knock offs of everything but\nI am definitely an Apple fan girl.\n\n189\n00:09:32.351 --> 00:09:34.254\nI'm just gonna tell you that right now.\n\n190\n00:09:34.254 --> 00:09:37.574\nBut I'm both,\nI don't discriminate by any means,\n\n191\n00:09:37.574 --> 00:09:42.180\nI like Windows just as well as Mac,\nhonestly, but I like Mac more.\n\n192\n00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.790\nAnyways, I can scroll down\nusing my long way around.\n\n193\n00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:47.561\nUsually we don't scroll on down.\n\n194\n00:09:47.561 --> 00:09:51.116\nSo you scroll on down and\nyou scroll on up, and that's totally fine.\n\n195\n00:09:51.116 --> 00:09:52.534\nWhichever way you need to go.\n\n196\n00:09:52.534 --> 00:09:56.786\nNow if I was on a Mac, in Excel for\nMac, my magic mouse does\n\n197\n00:09:56.786 --> 00:10:02.260\nactually scroll to the left and\nthe right, which is kinda cool.\n\n198\n00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:03.920\nBut since I'm in here, that's all right.\n\n199\n00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.420\nIf you need to go left and right,\n\n200\n00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.433\nyou're gonna have to go down to\nyour scrolls over on the bottom.\n\n201\n00:10:08.433 --> 00:10:12.820\nAll right, so that's how we\ncan move around by scrolling.\n\n202\n00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:13.835\nAll right, so\n\n203\n00:10:13.835 --> 00:10:19.345\nI now I get to my favorite part of\nnavigating with your keyboard, yay, okay.\n\n204\n00:10:19.345 --> 00:10:22.280\nSo try to take your hands off the mouse.\n\n205\n00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.360\nNow I'll probably still have to go to it,\n\n206\n00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.340\nbecause it's just It's almost like\nan extension of your hand really.\n\n207\n00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:32.499\nBut try and get around with your\nkeyboard can be a lot easier sometimes.\n\n208\n00:10:32.499 --> 00:10:34.587\nNow we're not selecting right now,\n\n209\n00:10:34.587 --> 00:10:38.236\nall we're doing is just getting\nto the places that we need to go.\n\n210\n00:10:38.236 --> 00:10:42.502\nWe have a whole separate episode for\nselecting cells and everything like that.\n\n211\n00:10:42.502 --> 00:10:46.329\nWhich all these keyboard shortcuts\nare gonna kind of come back into play\n\n212\n00:10:46.329 --> 00:10:47.103\na little bit.\n\n213\n00:10:47.103 --> 00:10:49.650\nSo right now my active cell is C4.\n\n214\n00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:50.310\nThat's the one I have.\n\n215\n00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:53.374\nI'll even just move this over to\nthe side so we don't have to see this.\n\n216\n00:10:53.374 --> 00:10:57.291\nHow do you think I'm\ngonna move one cell down,\n\n217\n00:10:57.291 --> 00:11:01.421\none cell to the right,\none cell to the up or left.\n\n218\n00:11:01.421 --> 00:11:02.945\nWhat do you think, Daniel?\n&gt;&gt; With the arrow keys?\n\n219\n00:11:02.945 --> 00:11:05.083\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, the arrow keys,\n\n220\n00:11:05.083 --> 00:11:06.815\nthose arrow keys on your keyboard.\n\n221\n00:11:06.815 --> 00:11:09.737\nAnd I actually attached like\na full keyboard to my computer so\n\n222\n00:11:09.737 --> 00:11:13.251\nI could actually have access to these,\nnot that I don't have them on my-\n\n223\n00:11:13.251 --> 00:11:14.015\n&gt;&gt; You do.\n\n224\n00:11:14.015 --> 00:11:15.767\n&gt;&gt; Laptop, I just-\n&gt;&gt; It's a whole lot nicer on\n\n225\n00:11:15.767 --> 00:11:16.727\na full size keyboard.\n\n226\n00:11:16.727 --> 00:11:19.517\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so like,\nhere's my full size keyboard.\n\n227\n00:11:19.517 --> 00:11:20.484\nIt's a Mac keyboard.\n\n228\n00:11:20.484 --> 00:11:22.577\n&gt;&gt; It's a Mac keyboard,\npay no attention to that.\n\n229\n00:11:22.577 --> 00:11:26.143\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\npretend it's got Windows on there.\n\n230\n00:11:26.143 --> 00:11:29.401\n&gt;&gt; We'll tape a little Windows\nicon to it and we're good to go.\n\n231\n00:11:29.401 --> 00:11:31.730\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, oops I actually did\nsomething there, there we go.\n\n232\n00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:36.390\nSo arrow down, arrow right,\narrow left, arrow up.\n\n233\n00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:37.030\nClick, click, click.\n\n234\n00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.891\nClick, click, click.\nAnd you can go ahead and\n\n235\n00:11:38.891 --> 00:11:41.407\nmove all around to where you need to go.\n\n236\n00:11:41.407 --> 00:11:44.647\nSo if I need to go to the move here.\n\n237\n00:11:44.647 --> 00:11:45.895\nWell, there's F4.\n\n238\n00:11:45.895 --> 00:11:48.980\nSo now that's my active cell and\nI can do whatever I need to do with it.\n\n239\n00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.392\nCopy, paste it, so on and so forth.\n\n240\n00:11:51.392 --> 00:11:53.370\nNow, there's some other\nkeys that you can use.\n\n241\n00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:55.780\nI'm using my down arrow key,\nso now I'm on cell F10.\n\n242\n00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:02.390\nIn Excel, how you can get one cell over\nto the right, you can use your tab key.\n\n243\n00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:08.050\nIf you use the tab, tab, tab, tab,\ntab, that gets me over to the right.\n\n244\n00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:11.850\nTo get a cell to the left,\nuse your Shift-tab.\n\n245\n00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:15.949\nSo hold your shift key, click the tab,\nand then I go to the left.\n\n246\n00:12:15.949 --> 00:12:20.641\nSo think about if you're doing data entry,\nit's like, type, type, type, tab,\n\n247\n00:12:20.641 --> 00:12:21.315\ntab, tab.\n\n248\n00:12:21.315 --> 00:12:26.117\nAnd we've talked about tabs and Shift-tabs\nin lists when we were doing word of\n\n249\n00:12:26.117 --> 00:12:30.203\nlike indenting and outdenting,\nso this should be pretty common.\n\n250\n00:12:30.203 --> 00:12:35.498\nNow I'm using my arrow keys for\na second to get here F6 just because,\n\n251\n00:12:35.498 --> 00:12:39.804\nyou're enter key on your keyboard,\nit takes you down.\n\n252\n00:12:39.804 --> 00:12:43.247\nIt's almost like when you hit Enter\nin Word, it makes a new paragraph.\n\n253\n00:12:43.247 --> 00:12:45.455\nWell, we're not in-\n&gt;&gt; Except this doesn't push cells down\n\n254\n00:12:45.455 --> 00:12:47.603\nwhen you hit Enter,\nit just goes to the one below it.\n\n255\n00:12:47.603 --> 00:12:49.595\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yeah,\nit's only a navigation thing.\n\n256\n00:12:49.595 --> 00:12:52.184\nYeah, good point,\nbecause in Word it moves.\n\n257\n00:12:52.184 --> 00:12:55.150\n&gt;&gt; Right, you would push, if you had\ncontent below that, you hit Enter,\n\n258\n00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:56.696\nit's gonna push that content down.\n\n259\n00:12:56.696 --> 00:12:59.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; In Excel, not doing that.\n\n260\n00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:00.552\n&gt;&gt; I'm glad you picked up on that.\n\n261\n00:13:00.552 --> 00:13:01.183\nThat's awesome.\n\n262\n00:13:01.183 --> 00:13:03.834\nI'm like, yeah, were-\n&gt;&gt; I'm a very bright child [LAUGH].\n\n263\n00:13:03.834 --> 00:13:05.865\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We were talking about Word,\nyeah,\n\n264\n00:13:05.865 --> 00:13:07.730\nand so it would be making paragraphs.\n\n265\n00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:09.190\nHere, it's just a navigation thing.\n\n266\n00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:11.820\nAnd so if you can hit Enter to go down.\n\n267\n00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:14.800\nYou can do Shift-enter to go up.\n\n268\n00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.918\nSo if you don't wanna use the arrow\nkeys you can use your tab and enter,\n\n269\n00:13:17.918 --> 00:13:19.970\nShift-tab and Shift-enter to go around.\n\n270\n00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:23.790\n&gt;&gt; Now really quickly, I don't wanna\njump ahead if that's what's happening.\n\n271\n00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:26.209\nSo you just let us know if\nthat's what's occurring.\n\n272\n00:13:26.209 --> 00:13:30.167\nIf when we get into things like\nequations and doing macros,\n\n273\n00:13:30.167 --> 00:13:34.598\nif I hit Enter is that going to affect\nthat cell in any kind of way, or\n\n274\n00:13:34.598 --> 00:13:37.549\nis it always going to\nbe just navigational?\n\n275\n00:13:37.549 --> 00:13:41.413\n&gt;&gt; If you´re actively in a cell,\nlike typing or creating a formula,\n\n276\n00:13:41.413 --> 00:13:45.833\nif you hit Enter, it´s like you´re\nsaying I´m done and it will move down.\n\n277\n00:13:45.833 --> 00:13:49.209\nSo just to show you what I´m doing,\nif I type here, see how I´m just,\n\n278\n00:13:49.209 --> 00:13:50.487\nI have a flashing cursor?\n\n279\n00:13:50.487 --> 00:13:52.071\nIf I hit Enter, it´s like I´m done,\n\n280\n00:13:52.071 --> 00:13:55.860\nI've committed whatever we've put into\nthat cell and I¨m moving down one.\n\n281\n00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:59.720\nSo that's exactly what it will do,\nso good point, awesome.\n\n282\n00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:05.115\nBut it doesn't move any of the content\nbelow it down like in Word, so perfect.\n\n283\n00:14:05.115 --> 00:14:07.118\nNow there's another little trick or\n\n284\n00:14:07.118 --> 00:14:11.392\nlittle cute thing that you can do in\nconjunction with where you're starting.\n\n285\n00:14:11.392 --> 00:14:14.770\nI'm using my arrow keys, so\nI'm gonna come down here to F10.\n\n286\n00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:22.290\nIf I start tabbing from F10, I'm gonna\ntab, tab, tab, we're going to the right.\n\n287\n00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:24.190\nNow watch what happens\nwhen I hit Enter here.\n\n288\n00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:31.260\nIt acts almost like a carriage return\nin Word to where I hit Enter and\n\n289\n00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:36.650\nit's going to take me down to the next\nrow from where I started tabbing from.\n\n290\n00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:37.700\nSo that's kinda cute.\n\n291\n00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:44.850\nSo if I tab, tab, tab, enter,tab, tab,\ntab, enter, tab, tab, enter, enter.\n\n292\n00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:46.130\nNow it's just going back down.\n\n293\n00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:49.280\nBut if I use my arrow keys,\nso if I started here,\n\n294\n00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.430\nI'm using arrow right, arrow right, enter.\n\n295\n00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:53.880\nYou see, it doesn't do that.\n\n296\n00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:58.390\nIt's only where you started\nthe tab sequence from.\n\n297\n00:14:58.390 --> 00:14:59.416\n&gt;&gt; It's quirky.\n\n298\n00:14:59.416 --> 00:15:01.950\n&gt;&gt; It's cute right.\n&gt;&gt; I mean in my mind I'm already starting\n\n299\n00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:05.522\nto think okay, I can see why you\nwant to use one over the other and\n\n300\n00:15:05.522 --> 00:15:06.886\nhave that as an option.\n\n301\n00:15:06.886 --> 00:15:09.847\nBut it seems silly out\nof the gate [LAUGH].\n\n302\n00:15:09.847 --> 00:15:13.851\n&gt;&gt; No, yeah, it is one of those like if\nI was creating, like here, hello world,\n\n303\n00:15:13.851 --> 00:15:15.750\nhello world, I just did a copy down.\n\n304\n00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:16.477\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n305\n00:15:16.477 --> 00:15:21.765\nif I was supposed to type in\ninformation like one, two,\n\n306\n00:15:21.765 --> 00:15:26.616\nthree, next line, enter,\nthree, four, five.\n\n307\n00:15:26.616 --> 00:15:28.177\nWell I forgot to tab in between.\n\n308\n00:15:28.177 --> 00:15:32.179\nBut see now it's just like I\ndidn't want it to go down,\n\n309\n00:15:32.179 --> 00:15:37.680\nI wanted it to actually start a new line\nor a new sentence, if you wanna say.\n\n310\n00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.690\nIt's kind of, again, cute.\n\n311\n00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:40.840\nDoesn't mean that you have to use them.\n\n312\n00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.936\nIt's just one of those things that if\nyou use them together in sequence,\n\n313\n00:15:43.936 --> 00:15:44.559\nit does that.\n\n314\n00:15:44.559 --> 00:15:48.195\n&gt;&gt; And again, if you had 1, 2,\n3, and 4, 5, 6 you said for\n\n315\n00:15:48.195 --> 00:15:51.426\nwhatever reason I wanna put 12 And\nyou were at three and\n\n316\n00:15:51.426 --> 00:15:55.942\nyou hit enter, it would not push four,\nfive, six down and create a new cell.\n\n317\n00:15:55.942 --> 00:15:56.918\nIt would just go down there.\n\n318\n00:15:56.918 --> 00:15:57.670\n&gt;&gt; Yes ,exactly.\n\n319\n00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:58.614\nYeah, perfect.\n\n320\n00:15:58.614 --> 00:15:59.752\n&gt;&gt; I'm with you.\n\n321\n00:15:59.752 --> 00:16:00.760\n&gt;&gt; I like this.\n\n322\n00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:01.814\n&gt;&gt; I'm following along.\n\n323\n00:16:01.814 --> 00:16:03.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Awesome.\n\n324\n00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.570\nSo we have our shift tabs and\nall that good stuff.\n\n325\n00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:08.900\nOkay, so now we're gonna get into\nthe group of keys that's in the middle of\n\n326\n00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:09.820\nthe keyboard.\n\n327\n00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:14.500\nThe Home and the End, the E-N-D key,\nnot the N like the letter.\n\n328\n00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:18.530\nSo Home, End, those two ones together\ncan do some interesting things.\n\n329\n00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:21.300\nNow by themselves, right now, where am I?\n\n330\n00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:22.750\nI'm in C4.\n\n331\n00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:29.310\nIf I hit the Home key it will take me to\nthe first column of whatever row I'm in.\n\n332\n00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:32.800\nI'm gonna take my mouse so\nlike if I'm here, I'm on M7.\n\n333\n00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.720\nHit the Home key.\n\n334\n00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.310\nTakes me A7.\n\n335\n00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:39.280\nSo it's always gonna take me to\nthat first column of that row.\n\n336\n00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.510\nOkay cool.\n\n337\n00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:43.830\nSo I'll come back to the End\nkey in just a second.\n\n338\n00:16:44.965 --> 00:16:46.810\nLets say I'm way down here.\n\n339\n00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:49.490\nI'm not that far down but\nI'm somewhere else.\n\n340\n00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:52.821\nIf the quickest way to\nget back to A1 to home,\n\n341\n00:16:52.821 --> 00:16:56.760\nit not Home by itself,\nbecause that's the row.\n\n342\n00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:57.970\nIts CTRL+Home.\n\n343\n00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:00.920\nWe talked about this in Word if\nyou watched the Word series.\n\n344\n00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.700\nAnd CTRL+Home would always get you\nto the very top of the document, and\n\n345\n00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.070\nI was like that's so cool.\n\n346\n00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:08.080\nCuz sometimes when you're working on\nspreadsheets, you might be really,\n\n347\n00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:08.850\nreally far down.\n\n348\n00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:14.010\nYou might be like in row 560 and I need\nto get all the way back up to the top.\n\n349\n00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:14.670\nQuickest way?\n\n350\n00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:17.060\nCTRL+Home alwasys brings you back down.\n\n351\n00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.400\nPretty great.\n\n352\n00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:23.330\nSo now if you said CTRL+Home, you may\nbe thinking, well then CTRL+End, right?\n\n353\n00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:23.855\nIt does.\n\n354\n00:17:23.855 --> 00:17:25.955\nNow if I do CTRL and then the End key,\n\n355\n00:17:25.955 --> 00:17:29.110\nand it's actually kinda\nbehind my head right there.\n\n356\n00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:35.080\nit takes me to column AT, row 88.\n\n357\n00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.440\nLike, whoa, and\nI actually have I'm the end.\n\n358\n00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:37.968\n&gt;&gt; 80 88.\n\n359\n00:17:37.968 --> 00:17:39.200\n[LAUGH] AT 88.\n\n360\n00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.561\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] My God, I like that.\n\n361\n00:17:40.561 --> 00:17:41.650\nNice, I like that.\n\n362\n00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:44.926\n[LAUGH] So here,\nit is like now, how did I,\n\n363\n00:17:44.926 --> 00:17:48.895\nand I will do CTRL+Home now,\nthat took me to A1.\n\n364\n00:17:48.895 --> 00:17:51.500\nCTRL+End takes me to the end.\n\n365\n00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:56.740\nIt is going to take me to\nthe very last thing that it sees.\n\n366\n00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:03.740\nIn the data that you have entered as far\nover and as far down as your content goes.\n\n367\n00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:07.540\nSo that's why I put that way,\nway out there into, and\n\n368\n00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:11.103\nI'll scroll over so\nyou can see this a little bit.\n\n369\n00:18:11.103 --> 00:18:13.843\nIt took me all the way down to\nthere because that's where I put\n\n370\n00:18:13.843 --> 00:18:14.780\nthe information.\n\n371\n00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:18.860\nSo this also has given you a little\nclue as to our column references.\n\n372\n00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:21.170\nIt goes A then to Z.\n\n373\n00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:22.770\nWell then what does it\ndo once it's after Z?\n\n374\n00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:26.050\nIt goes AA, AB, da, da, da.\n\n375\n00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:27.300\nOkay, wow, that's a lot.\n\n376\n00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:29.530\nOkay, and\nhow many rows we got going on here?\n\n377\n00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:30.910\nWell let me do CTRL+Home again.\n\n378\n00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:31.730\nIt takes you here.\n\n379\n00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:34.880\nWe talked about our arrow keys, correct?\n\n380\n00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.660\nWe said the arrow right, arrow down.\n\n381\n00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:42.385\nWell if you hold your CTRL key and your\nRight Arrow, whoa where did I just go?\n\n382\n00:18:42.385 --> 00:18:43.589\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You did XFD.\n\n383\n00:18:43.589 --> 00:18:47.420\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He went to the ends of the earth,\n\n384\n00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:48.270\nbasically.\n\n385\n00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:52.380\nThis is the last column, because do\nyou know that in an Excel worksheet,\n\n386\n00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:56.280\nyou can have 16,384 columns.\n\n387\n00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:58.177\nReally.\n\n388\n00:18:58.177 --> 00:18:59.690\n&gt;&gt; It's a lot.\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot, yeah.\n\n389\n00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:03.900\nSo using those CTRL arrow keys\ncan get you down some places.\n\n390\n00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.920\nNow look at where I'm at right here.\n\n391\n00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:06.590\nI'm in cell A1.\n\n392\n00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:12.240\nIf I hold my CTRL key and\nthen hit the Down Arrow key, notice\n\n393\n00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:17.540\nthat it jumps down to the next place\nwhere it sees content within this column.\n\n394\n00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:22.485\nLet's do it again, CTRL+Down Arrow,\ngets me all the way down, let me scroll so\n\n395\n00:19:22.485 --> 00:19:24.323\nyou can see this a little bit.\n\n396\n00:19:24.323 --> 00:19:28.350\nYou see,\nthat's that last row within column A.\n\n397\n00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:35.880\nIf I do CTRL+Down again, ooh, well now\nI'm getting down into row one million.\n\n398\n00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:41.758\nYes, because I have 1,048,576 rows\nthat are available in an Excel sheet,\n\n399\n00:19:41.758 --> 00:19:44.010\none sheet, that's one sheet.\n\n400\n00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:48.597\nAnd then how many sheets you can have,\nI think you used to be able to have 255\n\n401\n00:19:48.597 --> 00:19:53.270\nworksheets, but then I think now it's\njust the size limitation of your file.\n\n402\n00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:54.290\nI believe it's 4 gigs.\n\n403\n00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:56.670\nYou can't have a file over 4 gigs.\n\n404\n00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:57.360\nThat's a lot of information.\n\n405\n00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.230\nIf you're putting that much\ninformation into a file,\n\n406\n00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:00.240\nyou don't need to be using Excel.\n\n407\n00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.187\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say,\n\n408\n00:20:01.187 --> 00:20:05.673\nI'm starting to see when people are using\nthis as a database when they shouldn't be\n\n409\n00:20:05.673 --> 00:20:06.967\nusing it as a database.\n\n410\n00:20:06.967 --> 00:20:11.808\nBecause it's really allowing them in\na lot of ways really be a database for\n\n411\n00:20:11.808 --> 00:20:15.780\nthem even though it's not\nreally what it's meant for.\n\n412\n00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:16.320\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n413\n00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.810\nA database and spreadsheet\nare not really the same things.\n\n414\n00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:22.050\nBut people use it as that storage, yes.\n\n415\n00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:23.930\nSo if you're using that much,\nyou need to go a little bit up.\n\n416\n00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:27.770\nIt's kind of like making Word\nbe like a page layout program.\n\n417\n00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:28.930\nIt doesn't do that.\n\n418\n00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:29.558\nYou can try.\nAnd\n\n419\n00:20:29.558 --> 00:20:33.188\nit will do it, but InDesign as the next\n[INAUDIBLE] or even Publisher,\n\n420\n00:20:33.188 --> 00:20:35.640\nif we're gonna stay in\nthe Microsoft family.\n\n421\n00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:40.270\nSo that cool stuff with our control\narrow keys, same thing here.\n\n422\n00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:41.430\nI'm using my mouse.\n\n423\n00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:45.520\nI'm gonna click over here to I7, hold\nmy CTRL key down, hit the Right Arrow.\n\n424\n00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:50.760\nIt's gonna go to the end of that\ncontiguous range of information,\n\n425\n00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.530\nthe most rightest.\n\n426\n00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:53.030\nWow.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n427\n00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:54.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the most right cell within\n\n428\n00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:55.550\nthat range.\n\n429\n00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:56.730\nBut now if I hold CTRL and\n\n430\n00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:59.220\nhit the right key again it's gonna go\nall away to the that other column.\n\n431\n00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:03.080\nSo you can see that it's not just for\ntaking you to the ends of the earth.\n\n432\n00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:08.040\nIt's really just taking you to\nthe ends of this range of information.\n\n433\n00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:09.540\nTalk about databases.\n\n434\n00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:11.100\nThese records and all of that.\n\n435\n00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:14.908\nSo holding CTRL,\nhit the Arrow key Last column within this\n\n436\n00:21:14.908 --> 00:21:20.070\nrange hold CTRL down arrow\nlast row within this range.\n\n437\n00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:24.010\nSo, you can kinda jump around\nquickly thinking that if you have\n\n438\n00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:28.590\na list of customers, or addresses,\nor whatever that you might have.\n\n439\n00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:33.505\nYou might easily have 60,000 rows and\n25 columns in something that you're\n\n440\n00:21:33.505 --> 00:21:37.167\nholding information about your whatever,\nyour customers.\n\n441\n00:21:37.167 --> 00:21:41.973\nSo it's good to be able to jump\naround really, really quickly so\n\n442\n00:21:41.973 --> 00:21:45.990\nI like those little tricks right there.\n\n443\n00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:50.730\nNow you could also navigate two\ncells through the name box cuz\n\n444\n00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:55.200\nall the places that we're going\nI'm gonna do CTRL+Home I have A1.\n\n445\n00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.180\nThat's where I'm at right now.\n\n446\n00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:00.110\nNow notice, look at my mouse cursor icon.\n\n447\n00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:01.240\nIt's got an I beam.\n\n448\n00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.770\nAn I beam means if I click,\nI can type text in.\n\n449\n00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:06.930\nSo if I click,\nI can type in the reference.\n\n450\n00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:14.330\nIf I type in say like, M for my column,\nand then 78 and then hit Enter.\n\n451\n00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:19.260\nIt's going to take me directly to\nthat cell, so you can type in it, but\n\n452\n00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:21.440\nyou can't use spaces, and\nyou have to make sure.\n\n453\n00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:25.290\nIf I type in Daniel.\n\n454\n00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:29.351\nThat's not gonna take me to you cuz\nit doesn't have any reference there,\n\n455\n00:22:29.351 --> 00:22:33.167\nnot unless I use a\n&gt;&gt; Plus, I'm unlisted, so [LAUGH]\n\n456\n00:22:33.167 --> 00:22:34.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so we get-\n\n457\n00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:35.944\n&gt;&gt; I love having the little jokes that get\n\n458\n00:22:35.944 --> 00:22:38.359\nyou, It's such a joy to work around her.\n\n459\n00:22:38.359 --> 00:22:41.500\n&gt;&gt; I know that I'm like wait,\nI'm teaching a show.\n\n460\n00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.950\nSo yes, you can have that\nnow you do have named ranges\n\n461\n00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:49.870\nthat if you could use words to\nreference specific ranges of cells,\n\n462\n00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:54.330\nthat's another level up,\nnot a huge level up but somewhere else.\n\n463\n00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:58.520\nAnd I believe when we were in\nthe navigate, no, the other file.\n\n464\n00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:01.240\nThe Christmas cats,\nwe saw that there are named ranges,\n\n465\n00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.205\nand I will show you how\nto do that eventually.\n\n466\n00:23:04.205 --> 00:23:05.168\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'll tell you.\n\n467\n00:23:05.168 --> 00:23:08.300\n[LAUGH] Later [LAUGH] all right,\nso now we've got our navigate so\n\n468\n00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.680\nlet's just do some zooms really quickly so\n\n469\n00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:14.190\nsometimes when I'm looking at this\nit's just like a little far away.\n\n470\n00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:16.130\nI need to zoom in.\n\n471\n00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:19.910\nBack over on our status bar down\nthe bottom right hand corner of our\n\n472\n00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:22.060\nstatus bar you can see behind my head.\n\n473\n00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:25.380\nYou can see that I have the little plus\nsigns and the minus signs that I can\n\n474\n00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:31.230\nalways come and zoom in to my workbook and\nsee the cells a little big bigger.\n\n475\n00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:33.310\nYou have a little zoom out buttons.\n\n476\n00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:35.180\nThat's fantastic.\n\n477\n00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:39.720\nNo reason why you can't use\nthe status bar in the zoom over here.\n\n478\n00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:40.520\nBut you know me.\n\n479\n00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.661\nI like different shortcuts.\n\n480\n00:23:42.661 --> 00:23:47.140\nSo how you can zoom in and out of your\nfile without using those buttons over\n\n481\n00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:52.440\nthere in the bottom, you can hold your\nCTRL key and then use your scroll wheel.\n\n482\n00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.814\nAnd then you can see I'm whoa, okay.\n\n483\n00:23:53.814 --> 00:23:54.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, crazy [LAUGH].\n\n484\n00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:55.675\n&gt;&gt; I zoomed it a lot to [LAUGH].\n\n485\n00:23:55.675 --> 00:23:59.840\nAnd then I control, scroll the wheel and\nthen I can zoom out and that's where you.\n\n486\n00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:03.011\n&gt;&gt; It's like Mike Roger, that's how he,\nif you've ever seen Mike's screen,\n\n487\n00:24:03.011 --> 00:24:03.789\nit's super tiny.\n\n488\n00:24:03.789 --> 00:24:04.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n489\n00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:05.184\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know and he's really bad eyes.\n\n490\n00:24:05.184 --> 00:24:07.260\n&gt;&gt; He does\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n491\n00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:08.480\n&gt;&gt; It's a great prescription.\n\n492\n00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.900\nThat's all I can say.\n\n493\n00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:13.010\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nit's like bifocal contact stuff, yeah.\n\n494\n00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:14.630\nI would, I don't know how I could do that.\n\n495\n00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:16.915\nSo hopefully I won't need those one day.\n\n496\n00:24:16.915 --> 00:24:17.616\nI'm probably going to.\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; You will.\n\n497\n00:24:17.616 --> 00:24:18.277\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n498\n00:24:18.277 --> 00:24:21.777\nyou can see like really far out here,\nlike there's that tiny cell.\n\n499\n00:24:21.777 --> 00:24:24.426\nRemember that one that I said was way\ndown in there because I was using\n\n500\n00:24:24.426 --> 00:24:25.039\nthat CTRL End?\n\n501\n00:24:25.039 --> 00:24:25.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n502\n00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:29.280\n&gt;&gt; So I could see there, and\nthen I can zoom in a little bit more.\n\n503\n00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.968\nSo and it might, hopefully I'm not\nfreaking you out over here [LAUGH] because\n\n504\n00:24:31.968 --> 00:24:33.570\nit's [SOUND] shaking\nthe screen a little bit.\n\n505\n00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:37.750\nBut that's how you can zoom in and\nout of the document, if I wanted to.\n\n506\n00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:40.490\nI just did a Ctrl Home to get you back.\n\n507\n00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:43.060\nYou always have your\nview tab as well to get\n\n508\n00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:45.980\ninto the specific zoom\nmagnification that you want.\n\n509\n00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:48.680\nYou could always find that button for\n100%.\n\n510\n00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:53.250\nSo if I zoomed in like too much and\nlike, oop quick way let's go ahead and\n\n511\n00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:56.914\nclick that button there and\nthen I can go ahead and zoom out.\n\n512\n00:24:56.914 --> 00:25:00.890\nQuick little adding into our interface?\n\n513\n00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:03.800\nThat's maybe a button that I'm\ngonna used a lot, I want to add it\n\n514\n00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:07.320\nto my Quick Access Toolbar because I don't\nwant to keep coming over on my View Tab.\n\n515\n00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:10.264\nIf you right-click on any\ncommand on the ribbon,\n\n516\n00:25:10.264 --> 00:25:14.085\nthere's always that option to\nadd to the Quick Access Toolbar.\n\n517\n00:25:14.085 --> 00:25:17.810\nSo, I'm not gonna remember where is this\nlater, but I'm gonna be using it a lot\n\n518\n00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:21.600\nyou can go ahead and do that and\nnow I have my zoom to a 100%.\n\n519\n00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:26.760\nThe other one that's kinda fun, let me do\ncontrol home, is the zoom to selection.\n\n520\n00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.660\nIf you have selected cells and\n\n521\n00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:33.970\nyou click this button it'll zoom you\ninto however much you have selected.\n\n522\n00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:38.670\nRight now it's just a single cell so\nit's, woo, that's really far in, and so\n\n523\n00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:39.500\nnow I go back to 100%.\n\n524\n00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:44.930\nSo that zoom to selection is a handy\nlittle little button right there.\n\n525\n00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:49.480\nAlright and then the last few things that\nI wanted to talk about were the views\n\n526\n00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.320\nthat you have since we're on the view tab.\n\n527\n00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.483\nThat's why I put that in this\norder here looking at my notes.\n\n528\n00:25:54.483 --> 00:25:55.830\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's a method to\n\n529\n00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:56.774\nyour madness there Vonne.\n\n530\n00:25:56.774 --> 00:26:00.246\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know sometimes there is, sometimes.\n\n531\n00:26:00.246 --> 00:26:05.640\n[LAUGH] We have our normal we also have\npage break preview and page layout.\n\n532\n00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.050\nThere's a lot of views in Word,\n\n533\n00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:09.860\nthere's not as many in Excel,\nwhich is kind of nice.\n\n534\n00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:14.040\nThis, to me,\nI rarely ever come out of normal view.\n\n535\n00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.470\nBut page layout?\n\n536\n00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:20.220\nThis is where talking about Word,\nwhere it's going to show you every\n\n537\n00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.330\npage, like 8 1/2 by 11,\nlike when you're going to print this out.\n\n538\n00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:28.680\nIts showing you what this looks like.\n\n539\n00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:34.670\nIn that view and you can see the actual\nbreaks and where you can add headers and\n\n540\n00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:39.440\nfooters to where you see all of your,\nhm, page layout items.\n\n541\n00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.810\nAnd so now I've got all of that,\nokay lovely.\n\n542\n00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:45.750\nBut now I don't wanna see this\nanymore because to me this isn't Word.\n\n543\n00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:47.520\nI don't think of this in pages.\n\n544\n00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.050\nI think of this in a spreadsheet.\n\n545\n00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:51.680\nI don't tend to like this.\n\n546\n00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:54.510\nI'd just go back over to normal but,\ndo notice something.\n\n547\n00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:57.650\nDo you see here and it may get\nbe hard to see on the recording.\n\n548\n00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:00.140\nBut do you see there's like these\ndotted lines going on here?\n\n549\n00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:04.650\nAnd if I zoom out of the document,\nhere we go.\n\n550\n00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:09.460\nAs soon as you've switched this view and\nthe page layout and\n\n551\n00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:13.320\ncome back in a normal it\nwill always show you,\n\n552\n00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:19.070\nwhere the breaks in the pages\nare gonna show up when you print this.\n\n553\n00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:22.010\nSo it's kinda nice because if I\nwas trying to get everything on\n\n554\n00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:25.900\na piece of paper I could try to\nstay within those dotted lines.\n\n555\n00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:28.850\nBut I've had people like I don't know\nwhat I did there's dotted lines on here.\n\n556\n00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:30.400\nIt's like it's okay don't worry.\n\n557\n00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:34.160\nIt's just showing you where\nthe printed page is going to end up.\n\n558\n00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:37.790\nWhich means that if I come over\nhere to page break preview,\n\n559\n00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:39.150\nthat's also another way.\n\n560\n00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:43.658\nNow it makes sees with these blue lines\nthat come up in page break preview.\n\n561\n00:27:43.658 --> 00:27:48.430\nAnd once you're in page break preview, you\ncan actually move where the breaks are.\n\n562\n00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:50.840\nIt's like when we do next page break or\n\n563\n00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:54.570\ncontinue a section break or\na hard page break in Word?\n\n564\n00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:56.940\nIt's the same idea here and\nyou can move them around.\n\n565\n00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:03.040\nBut you will get dotted lines back in\nnormal anytime you switch your views.\n\n566\n00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:05.720\nAnd the last thing I wanna talk about,\n\n567\n00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:08.380\nif we're talking about\nnavigating a worksheet.\n\n568\n00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:11.100\nWell what if I needed to go\nto a different worksheet?\n\n569\n00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:14.190\nDown at the bottom,\nwe have our little tabs,\n\n570\n00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:18.290\nour worksheet tabs across that\ntell us that this is sheet one.\n\n571\n00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:21.410\nIf I wanted to go to sheet three,\nyou'd just click on it.\n\n572\n00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:22.810\nSingle click, don't double.\n\n573\n00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:24.650\nSingle click that's pretty easy.\n\n574\n00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:28.610\nHey I want to go to six, here's six.\n\n575\n00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:29.464\nFive.\nThree.\n\n576\n00:28:29.464 --> 00:28:31.340\nTwo.\nThere's four in there, too.\n\n577\n00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:33.112\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n578\n00:28:33.112 --> 00:28:38.860\nI can go over to those different places\nand I can navigate my worksheets.\n\n579\n00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:40.210\nBut I do wanna show you a shortcut.\n\n580\n00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:41.050\nIt's just kinda fun.\n\n581\n00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:42.988\n&gt;&gt; Wouldn't be Vonne,\nif you didn't show us a shortcut.\n\n582\n00:28:42.988 --> 00:28:43.787\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know right?\n\n583\n00:28:43.787 --> 00:28:46.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So if you hold your ctrl key and\n\n584\n00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:53.410\nyour page up, or page down,\nyour page down is gonna go down the page.\n\n585\n00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:58.607\nIt's weird, because page down and page up,\nI would think I'm going up in numbers.\n\n586\n00:28:58.607 --> 00:29:01.620\nSo, but it's not, it's the order, okay?\n\n587\n00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:04.440\nI'm going up in my order or\ndown in my order.\n\n588\n00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:10.940\nSo Ctrl+Page Up, Ctrl+Page Down will\njump you from worksheet to worksheet.\n\n589\n00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:13.390\nAnd I believe, as I'm looking at my notes,\n\n590\n00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:18.660\nI believe I have covered everything that I\nwanted to cover in navigating a workbook.\n\n591\n00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:20.270\nWe've gone all over the places,\n\n592\n00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:24.510\nI got you different paths to\ntake to your destinations.\n\n593\n00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:28.330\nSo now that you know how to navigate,\nthe next episode we're gonna talk about\n\n594\n00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:32.160\nselecting those cells, so\nwe can go ahead and do things.\n\n595\n00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:35.302\nLike maybe make them red,\nwhich would be in another episode.\n\n596\n00:29:35.302 --> 00:29:36.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But, trying to keep it\n\n597\n00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:37.590\nin digestible chunks.\n\n598\n00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:40.730\nWe'll go ahead and\nmove onto math in our journey.\n\n599\n00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:43.940\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne, we've learned some\nvery important things in this episode,\n\n600\n00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:47.120\nlike, what is a workbook,\nand how to navigate it.\n\n601\n00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:47.742\nIt's been a lot of fun.\n\n602\n00:29:47.742 --> 00:29:49.070\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, perfect.\n\n603\n00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:51.110\n&gt;&gt; Well, no,\na lot of great information in here.\n\n604\n00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:53.010\nAgain, building that\nfoundational knowledge,\n\n605\n00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:58.410\nso that as we talk about things and get\ninto more complex topics inside of Excel,\n\n606\n00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:00.620\nterminology is the same,\ndefinitions are the same.\n\n607\n00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:02.760\nWe all know what everyone's\ntalking about and\n\n608\n00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.680\nthat is the point of doing\nthese basic type shows.\n\n609\n00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:11.000\nSo definitely continue to join with us as\nwe continue throughout Excel essentials.\n\n610\n00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.250\nBut for this episode, we are out of time.\n\n611\n00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:14.010\nWe do thank you for\n\n612\n00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:17.670\nwatching though, signing off for OfficePro\nTV, I've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n613\n00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:18.270\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne

Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n22\n00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.627\n&gt;&gt; Like a tongue twister.\n\n23\n00:00:47.627 --> 00:00:48.640\n&gt;&gt; A little bit.\n\n24\n00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.050\n&gt;&gt; Essential series sea shells\nby the essential series shore.\n\n25\n00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.460\nWow, that was pretty good.\n\n26\n00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.620\nNot bad, not bad.\n\n27\n00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.872\nAnd we're gonna be talking\nabout selecting cells.\n\n28\n00:00:57.872 --> 00:00:59.776\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Sounds like an 80s pop band.\n\n29\n00:00:59.776 --> 00:01:01.630\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't,\n\n30\n00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.380\nwe were just doing this before we started.\n\n31\n00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.210\nWe were singing all sorts of songs and\nwe have the dance moves and\n\n32\n00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.793\neverything going, so.\n\n33\n00:01:06.793 --> 00:01:08.770\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know what you're talking about.\n\n34\n00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.504\nShe's full of lies, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n35\n00:01:10.504 --> 00:01:12.100\nDon't listen to her.\n\n36\n00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.745\n&gt;&gt; We like to have fun.\n\n37\n00:01:12.745 --> 00:01:13.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n38\n00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.420\nwe're gonna talk about how to select\nthe contents in our Excel worksheets and\n\n39\n00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.380\nworkbooks.\n\n40\n00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.480\nAnd so I've got a file, so\nwhy don't we just go ahead and\n\n41\n00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.460\nget started of navigate a workbook.\n\n42\n00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.350\nWe talked about this when we did\nour navigate a workbook episode.\n\n43\n00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.151\nAnd so I've just continued on and\nmade a few different things.\n\n44\n00:01:31.151 --> 00:01:35.776\nAnd just to let you know, this file might\nbe slightly different than the one that\n\n45\n00:01:35.776 --> 00:01:39.589\nwas in that particular episode\nbecause I added a few more things.\n\n46\n00:01:39.589 --> 00:01:41.370\n&gt;&gt; A little more flair.\n\n47\n00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.900\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I did.\n\n48\n00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.840\nYes, so if you're using this exact file\nfor that episode and like, well this is in\n\n49\n00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.806\nhere but not in your recording, I kind of-\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n50\n00:01:49.806 --> 00:01:51.837\n&gt;&gt; Kept on expanding,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n51\n00:01:51.837 --> 00:01:53.170\n&gt;&gt; It 's a work in progress so\n\n52\n00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.720\n[LAUGH] All right, so we're gonna go\nover how to select, like I've said.\n\n53\n00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.840\nThere's a couple different techniques,\nI'm gonna show you with the mouse and\n\n54\n00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.240\nof course with the keyboard and all sorts\nof little tips and tricks along the way.\n\n55\n00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:12.690\nWe did talk about knowing what an active\ncell is, right now my active cell is E12.\n\n56\n00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.241\nBecause I know I have the box around\nthere and I have my column and\n\n57\n00:02:16.241 --> 00:02:20.470\nrow references highlighted and it also\ntells me that that is the name box.\n\n58\n00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.480\nSo we had gone over that.\n\n59\n00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.770\nWell now we need to start selecting cuz\nI need to do things with my content,\n\n60\n00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.210\nsay, make it a different font,\ndifferent color, perform calculations,\n\n61\n00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.580\nwhich is in a total different series.\n\n62\n00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.160\nBut you need to know how to\nselect before you can affect.\n\n63\n00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.020\nOur wonderful rules of computers, we have\nselect to affect, hover to discover,\n\n64\n00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.760\nwas one of our tool tips and\nthen when in doubt, try it out.\n\n65\n00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n66\n00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.560\ncuz that's where it rhymes\nwith right-clicking.\n\n67\n00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.990\nSo we go through all the different ways of\nthose are three basic rules of computers.\n\n68\n00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.210\nSo if I want to select a cell,\nyou can just click.\n\n69\n00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.680\nIf I want a single cell, I just click\non that and that is selecting it.\n\n70\n00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.940\nBut if I need a range of cells, for\n\n71\n00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.656\nexample I would like to\nselect cells A8 through C14.\n\n72\n00:03:08.656 --> 00:03:13.310\nNow just hearing me just say\nthat terminology, that means A8,\n\n73\n00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.290\nmake sure I got my white plus sign because\nI need to make sure that mouse cursor icon\n\n74\n00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.170\nis on that big white plus, because\nthat's what I need for selecting cells.\n\n75\n00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.280\nNothing else.\n\n76\n00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.260\nCuz that does other things.\n\n77\n00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.350\nSo I take my white plus sign,\nand I click, hold and\n\n78\n00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.320\ndrag to drag down to,\nI think I said C14, there we go.\n\n79\n00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.770\nKeeping that mouse button held\ndown until you get what you want,\n\n80\n00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.770\nyou let go of the mouse, and there you go.\n\n81\n00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:43.040\nI have made a selection of\ncells From A8 through C14.\n\n82\n00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.000\nAnd maybe you're not saying that in\nyour head, just like I want this.\n\n83\n00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.890\nSo you click, hold, and drag.\n\n84\n00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.450\nAnd then that's pretty common.\n\n85\n00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.510\nAnd we do that in Word and any other\nprogram or selecting multiple files.\n\n86\n00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.000\nBut again, we start from the basic.\n\n87\n00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.600\nWe never hypothesize on what you know and\ndon't know.\n\n88\n00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.770\nSo we start from the very beginning.\n\n89\n00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.822\nNow, deselecting,\nyou're gonna hear me say, click off.\n\n90\n00:04:04.822 --> 00:04:09.970\nYou're just gonna go ahead and click off\nover there to stop having this selected.\n\n91\n00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.630\nYou just find an empty cell or\neven a cell that has content,\n\n92\n00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.170\nyou just single click and\nthen it goes ahead and\n\n93\n00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.080\ndeselects that selection of I almost\nsaid text, of cells, that you have.\n\n94\n00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.380\nI started talking about Word.\n\n95\n00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.570\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n222\n00:11:07.702 --> 00:11:10.657\nthen now you've got that range of cells.\n\n223\n00:11:10.657 --> 00:11:13.981\nIf I put my cursor here just\nsingle clicking, and I do Ctrl+A,\n\n224\n00:11:13.981 --> 00:11:18.015\nnormally you think select all, like\nthe whole cell or the whole worksheet.\n\n225\n00:11:18.015 --> 00:11:22.171\nBut watch,\nCtrl+A only selects that range of cells.\n\n226\n00:11:22.171 --> 00:11:23.009\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty awesome right there.\n\n227\n00:11:23.009 --> 00:11:23.599\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n228\n00:11:23.599 --> 00:11:26.158\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I'm so\nused to having the ubiquitous Ctrl+A, and\n\n229\n00:11:26.158 --> 00:11:27.444\neverything's selected.\n\n230\n00:11:27.444 --> 00:11:29.012\nWhich is nice, don't get me wrong and\n\n231\n00:11:29.012 --> 00:11:30.876\nsometimes that's exactly\nwhat I want to do.\n\n232\n00:11:30.876 --> 00:11:33.291\nBut that is the next\nlevel stuff right there.\n\n233\n00:11:33.291 --> 00:11:33.998\n&gt;&gt;

And then you can quickly\nre-select that area too.\n\n398\n00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:45.550\nIt was very cool.\n\n399\n00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:48.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's one for navigating,\nbut it's also for selecting.\n\n400\n00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.260\nSo yeah, really, really neat\nbecause maybe you really needed,\n\n401\n00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:55.320\nyou're always working in this particular\namount of data, these amount of cells.\n\n402\n00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.540\nSo just make a named range, and\nyou can use it as your drop-down.\n\n403\n00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:02.570\nJust to show you where that all lives,\nthat lives in your Formulas tab.\n\n404\n00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:05.120\nAnd that's right over here\nwith your defined names.\n\n405\n00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.450\nAnd if I go into the name manager,\n\n406\n00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:12.600\nthat's where it's going to show me what\nall of the different named range is.\n\n407\n00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:16.170\nLike here it has the meow, and\nlet me just zoom in on this.\n\n408\n00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:18.550\nWhoops, that's the wrong button,\nhere we go.\n\n409\n00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:23.060\nSee it says equa,l it's on sheet five,\nexclamation point.\n\n410\n00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:24.780\nThat means the name of the sheet.\n\n411\n00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:29.322\nThe dollar signs that you see,\nit says G10 through K15.\n\n412\n00:20:29.322 --> 00:20:31.780\nBut there's a dollar sign in\nfront of the G and the 10.\n\n413\n00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:35.060\nThat is what is known as\nan absolute reference.\n\n414\n00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:36.220\nIt's never gonna move.\n\n415\n00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:42.110\nIt's like we're absolutely on G10\nall the way through absolutely K15.\n\n416\n00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:46.940\nSo you'll see this when we start\nperforming functions in that other series.\n\n417\n00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:48.480\nAnd this is gonna make a big difference so\n\n418\n00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.820\nyou don't have what is known\nas relative reference.\n\n419\n00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:52.900\nThis is an absolute reference.\n\n420\n00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:55.420\nOkay, if you're like, well then,\ntell me what that is.\n\n421\n00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.335\nNow I'll have to tell you to\njust go watch the other series.\n\n422\n00:20:57.335 --> 00:21:03.150\n[LAUGH] And you'll see some other episodes\non the just basic functions within Excel.\n\n423\n00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:04.120\nI tried to keep it separate.\n\n424\n00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:08.150\nI want to separate these two shows\ninto using Excel just as Excel\n\n425\n00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:10.560\nwithout performing calculations.\n\n426\n00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:14.550\nSo that's the logic of why I've\norganized the episodes like I have.\n\n427\n00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:19.990\n&gt;&gt; Seems logical, captain [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Why thank you [LAUGH] Oops I hit the-\n\n428\n00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:21.010\n&gt;&gt; That's the Edge browser,\n\n429\n00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:26.478\ndifferent show altogether [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I hit the question mark box,\n\n430\n00:21:26.478 --> 00:21:28.771\nthat was like, hey, what is this?\n\n431\n00:21:28.771 --> 00:21:31.124\nSo that's actually kind of\nnice if you're like, hey,\n\n432\n00:21:31.124 --> 00:21:32.640\nwhat was going on over here in this?\n\n433\n00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.570\nThat question mark just takes you right\nto the Help files, teachable moment.\n\n434\n00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:37.120\n&gt;&gt; It's right.\n\n435\n00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.720\n&gt;&gt; Right, but I really meant to\nhit the close button [LAUGH] and\n\n436\n00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.345\nget out of that dialog box, all right.\n\n437\n00:21:43.345 --> 00:21:47.809\nAnd the last thing that I wanted\nto show you in this selecting\n\n438\n00:21:47.809 --> 00:21:51.573\ninformation is in the Home tab and\nit's the Find.\n\n439\n00:21:51.573 --> 00:21:55.440\nAll the way over on the right\nhand side you have Find &amp; Select.\n\n440\n00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:58.210\nSo since it has the word select in\nit I figure it's fitting to put\n\n441\n00:21:58.210 --> 00:21:59.260\nin this episode.\n\n442\n00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.935\nIf you drop this down,\nthere are some things that,\n\n443\n00:22:01.935 --> 00:22:04.560\nwe'll use the find box in just a second.\n\n444\n00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.030\nBut the ones where if you're like,\nhey, just go ahead and\n\n445\n00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:09.180\nshow me where the formulas are.\n\n446\n00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:11.320\nShow me where the conditional\nformatting lives.\n\n447\n00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:15.870\nThese are all things that you're\ngonna learn how to do within Excel.\n\n448\n00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:17.120\nBut if I click on formulas,\n\n449\n00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:21.930\nnotice that it's gonna highlight all\nthe cells that have formulas in it.\n\n450\n00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:24.950\nBut take note that if I\nclicked over on sheet two,\n\n451\n00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:29.960\nwhich doesn't have any formulas,\nif I go over here and go to formulas,\n\n452\n00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:32.500\nit's gonna tell me there's nothing found.\n\n453\n00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:38.220\nBecause that particular part, it is\nworksheet specific, it's not workbook.\n\n454\n00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:44.841\nThat's the scope of what those particular\nquick finds will go ahead and do for you.\n\n455\n00:22:44.841 --> 00:22:49.804\nBut if I do go to Find, this is always\ngood to know about how to do Find and\n\n456\n00:22:49.804 --> 00:22:50.570\nReplace.\n\n457\n00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:54.620\nCuz that's another thing,\nlike hey, well, Fuego is, decided-.\n\n458\n00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:57.316\n&gt;&gt; We changed his name to muy caliente.\n\n459\n00:22:57.316 --> 00:23:00.985\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] His other name is fire pants.\n\n460\n00:23:00.985 --> 00:23:01.921\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n461\n00:23:01.921 --> 00:23:05.626\nwe call him fuego fire pants, with a whole\nbunch of other names that we call him.\n\n462\n00:23:05.626 --> 00:23:08.490\n&gt;&gt; Fuego pantalones, right, isn't that it?\n\n463\n00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:08.999\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n464\n00:23:08.999 --> 00:23:09.546\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n465\n00:23:09.546 --> 00:23:10.961\n&gt;&gt; Fuego, [LAUGH] exactly.\n\n466\n00:23:10.961 --> 00:23:12.231\nFuego Pantalones.\n\n467\n00:23:12.231 --> 00:23:13.081\nSo let's\n\n468\n00:23:13.081 --> 00:23:17.861\nsay there are things like a name change.\nWe have a new director or have a different\n\n469\n00:23:17.861 --> 00:23:20.571\nphone number, different address.\nAll the different reasons why you want to\n\n470\n00:23:20.571 --> 00:23:23.685\nfind something and then replace it, okay.\n\n471\n00:23:23.685 --> 00:23:25.007\nOr sometimes you just wanna find it.\n\n472\n00:23:25.007 --> 00:23:27.329\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I know that Fuego is somewhere in this\n\n473\n00:23:27.329 --> 00:23:29.957\nworkbook, I just can't\nremember where I put him.\n\n474\n00:23:29.957 --> 00:23:34.219\nSo if you type in Fuego right now,\nand I click find next,\n\n475\n00:23:34.219 --> 00:23:38.680\nit's gonna say,\nI can't find what you're looking for.\n\n476\n00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:39.510\n&gt;&gt; Is it case sensitive?\n\n477\n00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:45.400\n&gt;&gt; There's a couple options,\nhence the options button.\n\n478\n00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:49.500\nSo if I click the options button,\nright now the default location or\n\n479\n00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:51.940\nscope, it's only looking within the sheet.\n\n480\n00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:55.906\nOkay, but\nI can change that down to workbook.\n\n481\n00:23:55.906 --> 00:23:59.883\nIf I go to workbook, then it's gonna\nsearch across the whole workbook.\n\n482\n00:23:59.883 --> 00:24:03.251\nAnd that's where you could have\nit match case if you wanted to.\n\n483\n00:24:03.251 --> 00:24:07.711\nSo now if i go ahead and\ntype in a lowercase F for Fuego,\n\n484\n00:24:07.711 --> 00:24:10.298\nand I do not have match case on.\n\n485\n00:24:10.298 --> 00:24:14.370\nIf I choose Find all,\nthe cool thing is that it goes ahead and\n\n486\n00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:19.421\nit gives me almost like a little report\ndown underneath the box of, Okay,\n\n487\n00:24:19.421 --> 00:24:25.218\nwell, I've found it in sheet 4, A5, and\nI've also found it in sheet 6, A10.\n\n488\n00:24:25.218 --> 00:24:26.420\n&gt;&gt; That looks clickable.\n\n489\n00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:29.320\n&gt;&gt; It is.\nSo if I click it, notice that it has\n\n490\n00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:35.500\njumped me to Sheet 6, and\nexactly to the cell that it is located in.\n\n491\n00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:39.180\nSo that's really, really handy,\nespecially when you have,\n\n492\n00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:42.197\nYou might have 250,000\nrows of information.\n\n493\n00:24:42.197 --> 00:24:44.134\n&gt;&gt; Cuz we're using Excel as a database,\ninstead of a database as a database.\n\n494\n00:24:44.134 --> 00:24:47.375\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n495\n00:24:47.375 --> 00:24:49.360\nYeah, that's a lot of information.\n\n496\n00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.440\n&gt;&gt; There's many people out\nthere watching right now going,\n\n497\n00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.087\nI know what he's talking about\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n498\n00:24:53.087 --> 00:24:53.651\n&gt;&gt; My goodness.\n\n499\n00:24:53.651 --> 00:24:55.022\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n500\n00:24:55.022 --> 00:24:59.745\nBut in that form, like Hey, it does do\nthat a lot of that as long as you If you\n\n501\n00:24:59.745 --> 00:25:04.451\nstart to make and do things it's not\nsupposed to do, cuz it can support up to\n\n502\n00:25:04.451 --> 00:25:09.083\none million rows in one worksheet, so\nBut then, it's what do you want out\n\n503\n00:25:09.083 --> 00:25:14.020\nof that information, that's where\nthe line starts to get very, very gray.\n\n504\n00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:18.109\n[LAUGH] All right, so I can go ahead and\nfind those different places or\n\n505\n00:25:18.109 --> 00:25:22.794\nI can do the Find next, and I don't have\nthe Match case, and so, there we go.\n\n506\n00:25:22.794 --> 00:25:26.832\nNow, if I did choose Match case,\nit's still gonna Well, at this point,\n\n507\n00:25:26.832 --> 00:25:31.236\nit's not gonna find anything,\ncuz I just really decapitalized Fuego.\n\n508\n00:25:31.236 --> 00:25:36.243\nSo now, let me go ahead and do\nan uppercase Fuego, and Find all, perfect.\n\n509\n00:25:36.243 --> 00:25:40.416\nThat, Find, but one more step,\ngo to the Replace, Well,\n\n510\n00:25:40.416 --> 00:25:44.470\nnow I want to replace\nFuego with Fire pants.\n\n511\n00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:45.490\nSo that,\n\n512\n00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:49.520\nI am matching the case to make sure that\nit does replace it with the right case.\n\n513\n00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:52.740\nI can then replace each one individually,\ngo in to Find next,\n\n514\n00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:54.710\nReplace, Find next, Replace.\n\n515\n00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:58.620\nOr in this sense, go ahead and\njust Replace all, and now it is all done,\n\n516\n00:25:58.620 --> 00:25:59.755\nyou can see that now.\n\n517\n00:25:59.755 --> 00:26:05.697\nFuego is Fire pants, we click OK,\nwe close out of that, and there you go.\n\n518\n00:26:05.697 --> 00:26:10.684\nSo you can see some different ways that\nyou might want to use Find by itself, or\n\n519\n00:26:10.684 --> 00:26:13.387\nthe Replace which is always super handy.\n\n520\n00:26:13.387 --> 00:26:16.881\nAnd so,\nI believe that is the end of my notes.\n\n521\n00:26:16.881 --> 00:26:21.523\nAnd how we can select all the different\nways that we can select cells, to where,\n\n522\n00:26:21.523 --> 00:26:25.680\nif you can select it, then you can\naffect it, and that comes up later.\n\n523\n00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.183\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n524\n00:26:26.183 --> 00:26:27.420\nWell, Vonne, very cool stuff.\n\n525\n00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:30.690\nNow we have a better\nsense of how we can start\n\n526\n00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:33.650\ninteracting with the cells\ninside of Excel.\n\n527\n00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:35.533\nThat's kind of hard to mess\naround with the brain there,\n\n528\n00:26:35.533 --> 00:26:36.877\nbut that's exactly what we're doing.\n\n529\n00:26:36.877 --> 00:26:40.428\nWe're trying to manipulate them,\nwork with them, do stuff with them and\n\n530\n00:26:40.428 --> 00:26:43.250\nnow we know the many different\nways in which we can do that.\n\n531\n00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:45.100\nIt's not just click a cell and\ndo something.\n\n532\n00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:48.205\nWe have many options\navailable in front of us.\n\n533\n00:26:48.205 --> 00:26:50.740\nVonne, thanks for showing us how\nto do that, we do appreciate it.\n\n534\n00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:53.785\nWe do appreciate our audience for\nwatching, as well, but\n\n535\n00:26:53.785 --> 00:26:57.463\nit does look like we are at that time\nof signing off for OfficePro.TV,\n\n536\n00:26:57.463 --> 00:26:58.930\n&gt;&gt;

glad to have you back yet\nagain today in the studio, how's it going?\n\n7\n00:00:26.785 --> 00:00:27.688\n&gt;&gt; I feel like I wanna be like.\n\n8\n00:00:27.688 --> 00:00:28.604\n[SOUND]\n\n9\n00:00:28.604 --> 00:00:29.132\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n10\n00:00:29.132 --> 00:00:31.517\n&gt;&gt; The Test Track at Epcot, it's awesome.\n\n11\n00:00:31.517 --> 00:00:32.589\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've never done that one.\n\n12\n00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:35.668\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If we were just talking about-\n\n13\n00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:37.269\n&gt;&gt; So much fun, so much fun.\n\n14\n00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:38.534\n&gt;&gt; Walt Disney World and everything.\n\n15\n00:00:38.534 --> 00:00:39.085\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n16\n00:00:39.085 --> 00:00:42.344\n&gt;&gt; And so when you said I just have to-\n&gt;&gt; You have to experience.\n\n17\n00:00:42.344 --> 00:00:43.461\n&gt;&gt; The lines were just so long.\n\n18\n00:00:43.461 --> 00:00:44.351\n&gt;&gt; It was totally worth it.\n\n19\n00:00:44.351 --> 00:00:46.448\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nwe're gonna get a FastPass next time.\n\n20\n00:00:46.448 --> 00:00:47.391\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n21\n00:00:47.391 --> 00:00:48.738\nanyways as we're talking-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n22\n00:00:48.738 --> 00:00:50.406\n&gt;&gt; About the Magic Kingdom and\n\n23\n00:00:50.406 --> 00:00:53.598\nEpcot, we're gonna be\ntalking here in this episode\n\n24\n00:00:53.598 --> 00:00:56.290\nabout inserting data into our worksheets.\n\n25\n00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.154\nNow I use the term data, cuz I really\nwant to say like insert text but\n\n26\n00:01:00.154 --> 00:01:02.735\nof course in Excel you-\n&gt;&gt; It's not necessarily text.\n\n27\n00:01:02.735 --> 00:01:04.806\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah,\nI mean you can be putting numbers in,\n\n28\n00:01:04.806 --> 00:01:06.277\nyou can also be putting formulas in.\n\n29\n00:01:06.277 --> 00:01:11.538\nSo you're gonna be putting in other\nthings besides words into your worksheet.\n\n30\n00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:14.949\nSo that's why I use the term data or\ndata, whichever one you wanna go with,\n\n31\n00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:15.830\ntomato, tomato.\n\n32\n00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.466\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Which way do you say it?\n\n33\n00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:21.597\n&gt;&gt; I think I say data mostly, data.\n\n34\n00:01:21.597 --> 00:01:22.924\nI don't know, I go back and\nforth to pronounce with you.\n\n35\n00:01:22.924 --> 00:01:25.106\n&gt;&gt; Right?\nIt's when you really think about it,\n\n36\n00:01:25.106 --> 00:01:26.660\nI don't know how I say it now.\n\n37\n00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.661\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If I'm referencing Star Trek,\n\n38\n00:01:28.661 --> 00:01:29.299\nit's data.\n\n39\n00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:30.282\n[LAUGH]\n\n40\n00:01:30.282 --> 00:01:30.814\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n41\n00:01:30.814 --> 00:01:33.479\n&gt;&gt; There you go, [LAUGH] perfect.\n\n42\n00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.093\nSo were gonna be inserting our\ncontents into our workbook.\n\n43\n00:01:38.093 --> 00:01:41.972\nSo I'm gonna just start with a new file,\ngonna start a blank document.\n\n44\n00:01:41.972 --> 00:01:43.214\nNope, blank workbook.\n\n45\n00:01:43.214 --> 00:01:44.224\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There you go.\n\n46\n00:01:44.224 --> 00:01:48.427\n&gt;&gt; I will probably say text at least\na couple times in this episode, but\n\n47\n00:01:48.427 --> 00:01:50.510\nwe know it's data, same thing.\n\n48\n00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.596\nAll right, so\nlet's jump on down into here.\n\n49\n00:01:52.596 --> 00:01:56.476\nAnd we've got Excel docked into our\ntask bar down at the bottom, so\n\n50\n00:01:56.476 --> 00:01:58.777\nwe'll just go ahead and click on this.\n\n51\n00:01:58.777 --> 00:02:04.680\nGet our program started up, start a blend\nwork book right here and there we go.\n\n52\n00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.653\nWe're in cell A1 of sheet 1 of book 1.\n\n53\n00:02:08.653 --> 00:02:11.574\nAll right, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.\n\n54\n00:02:11.574 --> 00:02:15.573\nHow do you enter\ninformation into your cell?\n\n55\n00:02:15.573 --> 00:02:20.425\nWell, first of all you do need to have\nwhatever cell you want activated.\n\n56\n00:02:20.425 --> 00:02:23.810\nRight now it's in cell A1,\nso we'll stick with that.\n\n57\n00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.775\nThere are three ways that you\ncould insert content into,\n\n58\n00:02:26.775 --> 00:02:30.317\nyou're like really there's three\nways to put content into a cell?\n\n59\n00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:31.063\nThere is.\n\n60\n00:02:31.063 --> 00:02:35.293\nThe first one is just have it selected,\nstart typing, okay?\n\n61\n00:02:35.293 --> 00:02:39.191\nYou don't have to click anywhere,\nthat is the active cell.\n\n62\n00:02:39.191 --> 00:02:43.896\nSo if I start typing in christmas cats,\nyou can see that,\n\n63\n00:02:43.896 --> 00:02:49.790\nif I can type it correctly, that is\nwhere the contents go into the cell.\n\n64\n00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.835\nAt this point, I'm just gonna hit Enter.\n\n65\n00:02:52.835 --> 00:02:57.882\nThe only reason why I'm hitting Enter is\nto me, it's not just like move down one,\n\n66\n00:02:57.882 --> 00:03:01.480\nit's also like accept\nthe information that's in there.\n\n67\n00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.670\nLike I'm done, go ahead and\ncommit the changes to this cell.\n\n68\n00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.886\nSo I hit Enter and it does that.\n\n69\n00:03:07.886 --> 00:03:11.253\nBut you could just as\neasily hit the tab key or\n\n70\n00:03:11.253 --> 00:03:15.997\nyour mouse click off into another\ncell whichever way is fine.\n\n71\n00:03:15.997 --> 00:03:18.632\nSo I'll go back over to cell C4 now,\n\n72\n00:03:18.632 --> 00:03:23.222\njust because I'm picking random\ncells to go ahead and tell you,\n\n73\n00:03:23.222 --> 00:03:27.652\nthe second way to be able to\ninsert information into the cell.\n\n74\n00:03:27.652 --> 00:03:32.759\nYou can double-click on a cell,\nwhen you double click watch what happens.\n\n75\n00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:37.506\nYou can see that my mouse cursor\nnow turns to a I-beam and\n\n76\n00:03:37.506 --> 00:03:42.357\nI get the flashing cursor\ninside of the cell, all right?\n\n77\n00:03:42.357 --> 00:03:49.057\nSo when I have it there I can\nstart typing in christmas cats,\n\n78\n00:03:49.057 --> 00:03:54.015\nthere we go, and\nnow I've put in that text.\n\n79\n00:03:54.015 --> 00:03:58.586\nLike I said, you can hit the tab key, so\njust get out of the current cell if you\n\n80\n00:03:58.586 --> 00:04:02.390\nhave activated and have a cursor on and\nnow I've got that text.\n\n81\n00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:03.516\nCool, all right.\n\n82\n00:04:03.516 --> 00:04:06.330\nSo single click on a cell, start typing.\n\n83\n00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.898\nDouble-click on a cell,\nget the cursor, start typing.\n\n84\n00:04:08.898 --> 00:04:14.223\nOr method three get the cell\ninformation that you go into and\n\n85\n00:04:14.223 --> 00:04:16.790\ncome up to your Formula bar.\n\n86\n00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.334\nThe Formula bar is where it just shows\nthe contents of that particular cell,\n\n87\n00:04:21.334 --> 00:04:23.670\nget the I-beam in the Formula bar.\n\n88\n00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.128\nClick, get that flashing cursor and\nnow we can type in Christmas cast.\n\n89\n00:04:28.128 --> 00:04:30.670\nI still can't seem to type correctly.\n\n90\n00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.941\n[LAUGH] And then I will hit the Enter or\ntake your mouse off of it.\n\n91\n00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:41.352\nSo three ways, getting in the content,\nperfect, fantastic, pretty simple.\n\n92\n00:04:41.352 --> 00:04:44.157\nNow what about editing\nthe content of your cells?\n\n93\n00:04:44.157 --> 00:04:49.981\nBecause now maybe I wanna take cell C4 and\nI wanna change this to say,\n\n94\n00:04:49.981 --> 00:04:54.011\nChristmas cats are awesome,\nI want to edit it.\n\n95\n00:04:54.011 --> 00:04:59.231\nNow, if I have my active cell here and\nstart typing, it will change out.\n\n96\n00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:02.450\nIt will basically be\noverriding anything in here.\n\n97\n00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:07.360\nSo if I start typing in bunny,\nyou see all the information goes away and\n\n98\n00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.010\nnow the word bunny has\nbeen brought into cell C4.\n\n99\n00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.512\nNow if your like, oops,\nI didn't want to do that,\n\n100\n00:05:14.512 --> 00:05:16.386\nyou still have to commit the changes.\n\n101\n00:05:16.386 --> 00:05:19.943\nYou still have to get out of that\nactive cell or the typing or\n\n102\n00:05:19.943 --> 00:05:24.821\ninserting of information in that cell to\nbe able to do your undo button, right?\n\n103\n00:05:24.821 --> 00:05:29.248\nOur very best friend in the whole wide\nworld, Ctrl+Z is our keyboard shortcut.\n\n104\n00:05:29.248 --> 00:05:30.086\n&gt;&gt; Life saver.\n\n105\n00:05:30.086 --> 00:05:31.972\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I like that one.\n\n106\n00:05:31.972 --> 00:05:33.141\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n107\n00:05:33.141 --> 00:05:35.629\n&gt;&gt; And if I click it once,\nnotice that it goes back and\n\n108\n00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:38.311\nchanges it back to Christmas\ncast the way I wanted it.\n\n109\n00:05:38.311 --> 00:05:39.895\n&gt;&gt; I love when I suddenly\nlean on a keyboard and\n\n110\n00:05:39.895 --> 00:05:42.004\nthen things are just disappearing and\nlike-\n\n111\n00:05:42.004 --> 00:05:43.401\n&gt;&gt; No, no, what’s up?\n\n112\n00:05:43.401 --> 00:05:44.484\nI have control, yes.\n\n113\n00:05:44.484 --> 00:05:46.337\nJust here we go-\n&gt;&gt; Undo.\n\n114\n00:05:46.337 --> 00:05:47.467\n&gt;&gt; Undo.\n&gt;&gt; Undo, undo, undo, undo,\n\n115\n00:05:47.467 --> 00:05:48.140\nundo, undo, yeah.\n\n116\n00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.545\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you do have a drop\n\n117\n00:05:49.545 --> 00:05:51.191\ndown right here next to it.\n\n118\n00:05:51.191 --> 00:05:55.081\nSo if you had a lot of undos to do.\n\n119\n00:05:55.081 --> 00:05:57.230\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Undo to do.\n\n120\n00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.866\n&gt;&gt; You can pick like which one and\nhow far back you want to go in there and.\n\n121\n00:06:01.866 --> 00:06:02.731\n&gt;&gt; It’s a little history.\n\n122\n00:06:02.731 --> 00:06:05.602\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit’s just like history in Photoshop.\n\n123\n00:06:05.602 --> 00:06:09.629\nSo where you can pick what\nstate you want to go back into.\n\n124\n00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:12.429\nSo quite nice in that little drop down.\n\n125\n00:06:12.429 --> 00:06:16.402\nSo if I wanted to edit this cell and\nnot type over the information,\n\n126\n00:06:16.402 --> 00:06:18.361\nremember that double-click?\n\n127\n00:06:18.361 --> 00:06:21.915\nWhen you double-click, you can get\nthat flashing cursor into the cell.\n\n128\n00:06:21.915 --> 00:06:24.939\nAnd now you can go ahead and\nmove around within this,\n\n129\n00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:27.019\njust like you would anywhere else.\n\n130\n00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:32.346\nIf I say Christmas cats are cool,\nthere we go.\n\n131\n00:06:32.346 --> 00:06:35.163\nHit Enter to accept the changes,\nyou can see that.\n\n132\n00:06:35.163 --> 00:06:40.113\nI do wanna point out something\npretty important that I\n\n133\n00:06:40.113 --> 00:06:43.965\ninserted the information into cell C4.\n\n134\n00:06:43.965 --> 00:06:46.782\n[LAUGH] Start with the zooming in here.\n\n135\n00:06:46.782 --> 00:06:51.598\nBut do you notice how it goes over,\nthat looks like into column D and\n\n136\n00:06:51.598 --> 00:06:56.602\ncolumn E, the thing is the information\ndoesn't live there, okay?\n\n137\n00:06:56.602 --> 00:06:59.241\nIf I click on cell D4 right there,\n\n138\n00:06:59.241 --> 00:07:04.708\nnotice up on the formula bar there's\nnothing in there, same with E4.\n\n139\n00:07:04.708 --> 00:07:09.101\nBut clicking on C4,\nthat's where all the information lives.\n\n140\n00:07:09.101 --> 00:07:13.608\nBecause as long as there's\nnothing next to it,\n\n141\n00:07:13.608 --> 00:07:18.578\nlike in another one of those cells,\nin column D or E.\n\n142\n00:07:18.578 --> 00:07:23.932\nThen it's just gonna go ahead and\nshow over all of our other columns.\n\n143\n00:07:23.932 --> 00:07:26.459\nIt's when you start getting into,\n\n144\n00:07:26.459 --> 00:07:31.104\nhey I've got information in D4 now,\nthat it will cut it all off.\n\n145\n00:07:31.104 --> 00:07:36.075\nAnd you're gonna have to make a decision\nof either making the column to\n\n146\n00:07:36.075 --> 00:07:40.212\nallow you to see more contents\nof that particular column.\n\n147\n00:07:40.212 --> 00:07:44.903\nOr you get into formating yourselves with\nword wrap to where it goes to the end of\n\n148\n00:07:44.903 --> 00:07:47.603\nthe cell and\nwraps around kind of like in a Word\n\n149\n00:07:47.603 --> 00:07:50.685\ndocument where you have\nthat automatic word wrap.\n\n150\n00:07:50.685 --> 00:07:54.965\nYou have to tell it to\nwrap within the cell.\n\n151\n00:07:54.965 --> 00:07:59.394\nWe'll get into all those different things,\nwe modify our workbooks.\n\n152\n00:07:59.394 --> 00:08:02.058\nI think it's called modify\nworksheet from naming that episode.\n\n153\n00:08:02.058 --> 00:08:07.805\nSo, Filing in [CROSSTALK] in\nthe way that I plan on doing it so.\n\n154\n00:08:07.805 --> 00:08:12.140\nAnyways, we've got those different\nways that you can edit this cell.\n\n155\n00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.260\nNow since I just mentioned\nthe formula bar right,\n\n156\n00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:18.170\nthere was that three ways of inserting and\nthat three ways of editing.\n\n157\n00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:21.390\nIf I wanted to come up to\nhere with a selected cell.\n\n158\n00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:25.330\nChristmas cats, okay let's just take\nout some of those O's in there and\n\n159\n00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.980\njust say that they're just plain cool.\n\n160\n00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:30.270\nSo click up in the formula bar,\n\n161\n00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:35.660\nnotice you have these buttons next to\nthe formula bar for accept, or cancel.\n\n162\n00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:38.480\nSo if you wanted to you could click that.\n\n163\n00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:43.260\nNotice that it keeps the cell activated,\nor at least that's the selected cell, but\n\n164\n00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:44.592\nit commits the changes.\n\n165\n00:08:44.592 --> 00:08:47.210\nI've been ensuring you or saying,\ngo ahead and hit enter tab or\n\n166\n00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.480\nclick off of it which is\nthe same way as well.\n\n167\n00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:52.710\nThere is a shortcut though,\n\n168\n00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:57.200\ncuz this is one of those things that\nwhen you start to use Excel a lot,\n\n169\n00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:01.990\nyou do things where like, man,\nI wish there was an easier way to do that.\n\n170\n00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:07.475\nAnd this was one of them to where I\ndidn't want to have to take my mouse and\n\n171\n00:09:07.475 --> 00:09:11.160\ndouble-click to activate\nthe flashing cursor in the cell.\n\n172\n00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:16.190\nBecause if you've already noticed, I like\nto use the keyboard to navigate around.\n\n173\n00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:19.494\nSo if I get into to cell A1 but\nI wanna add in text into here,\n\n174\n00:09:19.494 --> 00:09:22.410\nI don't wanna have to double-click.\n\n175\n00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:28.760\nSo to activate your cursor into the active\ncell, the keyboard shortcut is F2.\n\n176\n00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:33.610\nI don't have an F2 key on my keyboard so\nI can't demonstrate that,\n\n177\n00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:36.721\nand you actually can't see me\nclicking on the keyboard anyways.\n\n178\n00:09:36.721 --> 00:09:39.315\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Just do it like this,\nI'm clicking on the keyboard, see.\n\n179\n00:09:39.315 --> 00:09:42.000\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so let's pretend here, F2.\n\n180\n00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:44.625\nThat was not my mouse clicking twice.\n\n181\n00:09:44.625 --> 00:09:47.995\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Not at all.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So, now I've got the cursor\n\n182\n00:09:47.995 --> 00:09:52.952\nhere, and then I can use my arrow keys,\nChristmas, yes.\n\n183\n00:09:52.952 --> 00:09:56.430\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n184\n00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:59.302\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nWell, no I don't want it there, so let me\n\n185\n00:09:59.302 --> 00:10:03.735\ngo ahead and back space and then move my\ncursor by my arrow keys to move over and\n\n186\n00:10:03.735 --> 00:10:05.840\nsay, Christmas cats are the best.\n\n187\n00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.660\nAnd then hit Enter.\n\n188\n00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:09.460\nSo F2, I love that shortcut.\n\n189\n00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:14.120\nThis is also not just an Excel thing,\nit's where if you wanted to rename files\n\n190\n00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.920\nin your Windows environment,\nyou can just hit F2 on the file name and\n\n191\n00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:21.080\nit will go ahead and\nactivate to rename the file.\n\n192\n00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.190\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne, this is something\nI'm looking at your screen,\n\n193\n00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:25.980\nyou're typing stuff, and you've got\nthat Christmas cats are the best.\n\n194\n00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.700\nSomething that's always\nconfused me about Excel.\n\n195\n00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:33.780\nThat Christmas cats are the best is\nmoved over into columns a, b, and c.\n\n196\n00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:38.402\nBut it's not really in b and\nc, is that correct?\n\n197\n00:10:38.402 --> 00:10:40.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we just talked about that.\n\n198\n00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it just leaves me out.\n\n199\n00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:43.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't make sense to me.\n\n200\n00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:47.450\n&gt;&gt; And it's one of those things to where\nas soon as you see this it's okay,\n\n201\n00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:48.940\nthat's fine, and\nif you don't type anything else.\n\n202\n00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:53.960\nIt's when you do things like this,\nI go to cell C1, and then say, hello.\n\n203\n00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.470\nAnd now it's cut it off.\n\n204\n00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:58.322\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n205\n00:10:58.322 --> 00:11:01.137\nSo how do I click B1?\n\n206\n00:11:01.137 --> 00:11:02.153\n&gt;&gt; B1 is there.\n\n207\n00:11:02.153 --> 00:11:02.713\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n208\n00:11:02.713 --> 00:11:03.617\n&gt;&gt; But\nit looks like there's information there.\n\n209\n00:11:03.617 --> 00:11:04.610\n&gt;&gt; It does, right!\n\n210\n00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:05.370\nThat's what freaks me out.\n\n211\n00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:07.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAlways look at your formula bar.\n\n212\n00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:13.400\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so the formula bar is the king\nof this land, whatever it says goes.\n\n213\n00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.302\n&gt;&gt; That cell right there,\nif there's something in it,\n\n214\n00:11:15.302 --> 00:11:16.540\nyou'll see it in the formula bar.\n\n215\n00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:21.550\nBecause if I click on cell A1,\nyou can that see that it's in there now.\n\n216\n00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:23.450\nClick on cell B1 it's not there.\n\n217\n00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:24.070\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n\n218\n00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:26.050\n&gt;&gt; And C, there is there.\n\n219\n00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:31.450\nThat is really confusing and when we\nget into merge cells, when you have\n\n220\n00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:36.770\nmerged cells you're taking multiple cells\nand combining them into one big cell.\n\n221\n00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:41.480\nSo sometime it's like, well I'm\nselecting here, here let me show you,\n\n222\n00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.410\nin Christmas cats example,\nwe're gonna need this file anyways.\n\n223\n00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:45.340\n&gt;&gt; Well there you go.\n\n224\n00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:49.810\n&gt;&gt; So here, if I come to this, it looks\nlike Christmas cats and its all centered.\n\n225\n00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:54.760\nBut if I click on this, notice that\nthe selection box goes all the way around.\n\n226\n00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.930\nAnd it says A1 in my name box, and\n\n227\n00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:03.390\nit says Christmas Cats Weekly Sales,\nbut this is one cell that has been\n\n228\n00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:09.340\nmerged across columns A through\nH to be one big cell.\n\n229\n00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:13.420\nSo that's where just kind of watching\nwhere are my borders around,\n\n230\n00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.300\nwhat is my active cell?\n\n231\n00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.310\nWhat is in the formula bar?\n\n232\n00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:19.840\nThis is another example of a merged cell.\n\n233\n00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:25.000\nSo here we have from it looks\nlike F14 down through H16.\n\n234\n00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.740\nThat is acting as one cell but\nit spans across all of them.\n\n235\n00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.900\nSo always watch the formula bar.\n\n236\n00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:36.400\nAnd like right here,\nrepresentative weekly sales.\n\n237\n00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:43.080\nSee how the sales kinda hangs over but it\ndoesn't live in I, it's just, it just is.\n\n238\n00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.700\n&gt;&gt; So if you started typing in there\nwe kinda shove the, what is that,\n\n239\n00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:47.275\nES out of the way?\n\n240\n00:12:47.275 --> 00:12:48.750\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And then kinda cover it?\n\n241\n00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:50.540\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; And this is where you need to,\n\n242\n00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:55.680\nyou don't have enough space for that\ncolumn, because this is a spreadsheet.\n\n243\n00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.230\nIt is in a tabular format.\n\n244\n00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:00.060\nSo if I need more space in that column.\n\n245\n00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:00.920\nI'll just show you right now.\n\n246\n00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But we have a whole episode on this.\n\n247\n00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:04.920\nYou come up in between\nthe column references,\n\n248\n00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.760\nyou see you get the line\nwith the two arrows?\n\n249\n00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.590\n&gt;&gt; You do.\n&gt;&gt; And you just click, hold, and drag and\n\n250\n00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:09.610\nthen I can make that bigger.\n\n251\n00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:15.100\n&gt;&gt; You have just changed my life when\nit comes to Excel because that was one\n\n252\n00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:15.690\nof the things.\n\n253\n00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:17.210\nI know it seems simple-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n254\n00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:19.330\n&gt;&gt; But it always was confusing to me.\n\n255\n00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:23.630\nIt was like, how do I get this to resize\nand always show me the correct size?\n\n256\n00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:26.720\nAnd now I know, it was this crazy\nlittle back and forth arrow thing.\n\n257\n00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.250\n&gt;&gt; And I'll show you another\ntrick while were here.\n\n258\n00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:28.940\n&gt;&gt; What the heck, right.\n\n259\n00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:32.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is like, yeah, this is-\n&gt;&gt; You're in a giving mood.\n\n260\n00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:33.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I am.\n\n261\n00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:37.000\nSo right here, now on this example we know\nthat Christmas cats are the best is in\n\n262\n00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.470\ncell A1 and hello is cutting that off.\n\n263\n00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:41.524\nI could click, hold, and\n\n264\n00:13:41.524 --> 00:13:43.930\ndrag cuz we know that now coming\nin between column A and column B.\n\n265\n00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:48.700\nIf you double-click,\nit will automatically fit\n\n266\n00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:54.460\nthe column to be as wide as the largest or\nlongest value in that column.\n\n267\n00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:56.420\n&gt;&gt; Where have you been all your\nlife with this information?\n\n268\n00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:58.332\nI swear, I needed this a long time ago.\n\n269\n00:13:58.332 --> 00:13:59.200\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, you know,\n\n270\n00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.870\nyou're scheduled to be my host for the\nnext two weeks so I've got more for you.\n\n271\n00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:03.855\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna learn a lot about Excel and\nI can't wait.\n\n272\n00:14:03.855 --> 00:14:07.270\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But the thing about this is where,\n\n273\n00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:09.240\nif you have something else,\n\n274\n00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:14.350\nif I had boy, now that column is wide-\n&gt;&gt; Is that wide.\n\n275\n00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:15.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n276\n00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:20.837\nBut you could change it to where I\ncould have some of it hanging over,\n\n277\n00:14:20.837 --> 00:14:22.710\nso you don't have to.\n\n278\n00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:24.790\nSometimes I do that autofit\nbecause it's great,\n\n279\n00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:27.215\nbut you might have something super,\nsuper long.\n\n280\n00:14:27.215 --> 00:14:27.840\n&gt;&gt; Hm-mm.\n\n281\n00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:31.010\n&gt;&gt; That's where if you could,\nyou can start like merging and\n\n282\n00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:35.130\nthen we can change the column\nsize of that one column A.\n\n283\n00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:37.630\nCuz now when you have that merge\nit's going across multiples.\n\n284\n00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:39.850\n&gt;&gt; Now can I blow my mind even further.\n\n285\n00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:44.988\nCan I make the row fatter and\njust have the text go underneath it?\n\n286\n00:14:44.988 --> 00:14:46.096\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n287\n00:14:46.096 --> 00:14:46.760\n&gt;&gt; Man.\n\n288\n00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.457\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm giving you a little preview!\n\n289\n00:14:48.457 --> 00:14:49.267\n&gt;&gt; I'm stealing your thunder.\n\n290\n00:14:49.267 --> 00:14:49.841\n&gt;&gt; That's all right!\n\n291\n00:14:49.841 --> 00:14:50.370\nYou know what?\n\n292\n00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:51.481\nYou know what?\nWe're on a roll.\n\n293\n00:14:51.481 --> 00:14:52.108\nThis isn't scripted.\n\n294\n00:14:52.108 --> 00:14:53.240\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What the heck.\n\n295\n00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:57.800\n&gt;&gt; So if we go ahead and do here,\nI make that column smaller.\n\n296\n00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.970\nCome over here between the rows,\nbetween the one and two, click hold and\n\n297\n00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:04.300\ndrag this down,\nwait there's one more though.\n\n298\n00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:04.960\nOkay?\n\n299\n00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.160\nIt doesnt wrap, does it?\n\n300\n00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.730\n&gt;&gt; No, it didn't wrap.\n\n301\n00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:09.270\n&gt;&gt; Word wrap isn't on by default.\n\n302\n00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:10.140\nRemember?\n\n303\n00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:14.310\nSo, if I select a cell,\nyou see that wrap text-\n\n304\n00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:15.080\n&gt;&gt; I love it.\n\n305\n00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:18.623\n&gt;&gt; Wraps extra long text into multiple\nlong lines so you can see all of it.\n\n306\n00:15:18.623 --> 00:15:21.925\nI like their description of it,\nI've never actually read it.\n\n307\n00:15:21.925 --> 00:15:24.240\n[LAUGH] When I click it,\nthat's how you do it.\n\n308\n00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.686\n&gt;&gt; We'd call this a show\nas far as I'm concerned.\n\n309\n00:15:25.686 --> 00:15:26.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean I'm done.\n\n310\n00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:27.700\nMy mind's blown.\n\n311\n00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:28.210\nI'm ready to go.\n\n312\n00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:30.375\nI just wanna start playing with that now.\n\n313\n00:15:30.375 --> 00:15:31.430\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; End scene.\n\n314\n00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:32.110\n&gt;&gt; End scene that's right.\n\n315\n00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:35.180\n&gt;&gt; We're not done though [LAUGH] but\nthat's pretty awesome right?\n\n316\n00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:36.480\n&gt;&gt; Very cool, very cool.\n\n317\n00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.070\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n318\n00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:37.894\nI'm glad I could help.\n\n319\n00:15:37.894 --> 00:15:39.443\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you,\n\n320\n00:15:39.443 --> 00:15:39.977\nVonne\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n321\n00:15:39.977 --> 00:15:43.636\nwe've got all the different ways that\nwe can insert text and naturally being,\n\n322\n00:15:43.636 --> 00:15:45.474\nlike now I want to kinda fit into there.\n\n323\n00:15:45.474 --> 00:15:49.160\nAnd we have some other tricks and tips\nwhen we get into our modifier worksheet\n\n324\n00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.127\nepisode, but I'm glad we can go ahead.\n\n325\n00:15:51.127 --> 00:15:52.104\n&gt;&gt; Little sneak preview.\n\n326\n00:15:52.104 --> 00:15:55.059\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and there's a couple of things\nthat we always kinda go over more\n\n327\n00:15:55.059 --> 00:15:55.570\nthan once.\n\n328\n00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:56.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, overlap.\n\n329\n00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.022\nYeah, it happens.\n\n330\n00:15:57.022 --> 00:15:59.237\n&gt;&gt; It's just the nature of the beast, so.\n\n331\n00:15:59.237 --> 00:16:00.530\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n332\n00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:06.625\n&gt;&gt; But getting other information into our\nworksheet Talk a little bit about copy and\n\n333\n00:16:06.625 --> 00:16:07.260\npaste.\n\n334\n00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.440\nSomething that is near and\ndear to probably all of our hearts.\n\n335\n00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.933\nIf its already somewhere,\nwhy do I have to recreate it?\n\n336\n00:16:12.933 --> 00:16:18.091\nBut just to throw out here that this is\nExcel, and talking about this tabular\n\n337\n00:16:18.091 --> 00:16:23.750\nnature of this spreadsheet application,\nit doesn't always work just like Word.\n\n338\n00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.550\nWord is like you can take\nit from the Internet,\n\n339\n00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:27.420\nyou can take it from\nPowerPoint all this stuff and\n\n340\n00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:31.490\njust throw it in there because it's\nlike a big piece of paper necessarily.\n\n341\n00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:36.790\nHere, it has to fit into\nthis grid that we have.\n\n342\n00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:38.840\nAnd so some information not,\n\n343\n00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:44.310\nit might not work as well as others when\nyou're copying, especially from websites.\n\n344\n00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:50.250\nYou're not gonna get a very good\npaste into here because of the HTML.\n\n345\n00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:53.470\nNow, if you're selecting something\nthat's already in a tabular format,\n\n346\n00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:56.242\nbecause you do have tables in HTML,\nthen it might copy over perfectly.\n\n347\n00:16:56.242 --> 00:16:57.466\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So you might be like, mine worked fine.\n\n348\n00:16:57.466 --> 00:16:58.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n349\n00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:02.680\nthat's just the way that web\npage is organized into there.\n\n350\n00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:05.580\nSo, I have our Christmas Cats example.\n\n351\n00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:12.510\nLet’s say I need some information out of\nthis worksheet into our other workbook.\n\n352\n00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:16.570\nSo we're going to click, hold and\ndrag when I select across here.\n\n353\n00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:21.700\nCuz I would like to get just the weekly\nsales and the daily totals to be\n\n354\n00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:27.024\nput into that other workbook, so\nwe click, hold and drag and we copy.\n\n355\n00:17:27.024 --> 00:17:31.660\nNow you notice that you have the little\nrunning ants around your area right\n\n356\n00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:32.820\ninto here.\n\n357\n00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:35.910\nSo, I know that this is the thing\nthat I have either copied or\n\n358\n00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:40.390\ncut, even if you did cut right here it's\nstill going show up here it doesn't like\n\n359\n00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:43.750\ndisappear until you paste it\nsomewhere else and then it goes away.\n\n360\n00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:49.060\nSo I'm gonna copy and\nthen switch on over to my worksheet and\n\n361\n00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:52.770\nI'm just gonna pick up random area,\nwe gonna go with H3 just because.\n\n362\n00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:55.280\nNow I'm going to paste.\n\n363\n00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:58.360\nYou can either right click,\nyou can Ctrl+V to paste.\n\n364\n00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:02.939\nI'm gonna do Ctrl+V for now, because I\nwant to talk about paste options, okay?\n\n365\n00:18:02.939 --> 00:18:06.800\nPaste options are well, options of\nwhat you want to do with paste in it.\n\n366\n00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.163\n&gt;&gt; You like the honey looking glue,\nthe white Elmer's glue?\n\n367\n00:18:09.163 --> 00:18:10.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You got many paste options.\n\n368\n00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.280\n&gt;&gt; Or the rubber cement.\n\n369\n00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.358\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; If you're dry in your fingers and\n\n370\n00:18:14.358 --> 00:18:16.903\npeel off and those little balls,\n[LAUGH] right?\n\n371\n00:18:16.903 --> 00:18:19.669\n[LAUGH] Okay so-\n&gt;&gt; We're such children [LAUGH].\n\n372\n00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:21.212\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We really are.\n\n373\n00:18:21.212 --> 00:18:25.535\nRight here you can tell really quickly,\noops that's the wrong one here,\n\n374\n00:18:25.535 --> 00:18:27.020\nAlt+Tab, there we go.\n\n375\n00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:31.207\nThis doesn't look the same,\nwhat's going on here versus over here.\n\n376\n00:18:31.207 --> 00:18:33.670\nWe have what are known as themes.\n\n377\n00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:36.980\nOkay there is a theme\napplied to the Christmas Cats\n\n378\n00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:39.910\nexample that is not\nthe same thing as here.\n\n379\n00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:44.510\nBut when you paste, it is defaulting into\n\n380\n00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:49.080\nthe destination theme rather\nthan the source theme.\n\n381\n00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:53.779\nWhich I believe in Word it's always\nlike it takes the default of the source.\n\n382\n00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:56.900\nThey're all about the paste\noptions that you can change.\n\n383\n00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.790\nIt's in the actual Excel options and\nI can show you where.\n\n384\n00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:05.520\nBut the cool thing is we've got our\nlittle paste options smart tag.\n\n385\n00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.340\nOkay, so we have this smart tag over here.\n\n386\n00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:11.480\nI'm gonna scroll over a little bit and\ndown so we can kinda get that in the shot.\n\n387\n00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.350\nSo if I click on here,\n\n388\n00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:17.050\nnotice that it has this drop down as to\nwhere, there's a lot of different ones.\n\n389\n00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:21.430\nLike in Word there are only three or four\noptions, here's like what's going on here?\n\n390\n00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:23.410\nYou just go ahead and hover over them.\n\n391\n00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:27.995\nNotice that right now, this is just\nregular old paste, but if I have this one,\n\n392\n00:19:27.995 --> 00:19:33.260\nokay formulas, versus number formatting,\nversus keep the source format.\n\n393\n00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.230\nLet's start with that one.\n\n394\n00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:36.310\nI want it to look exactly\nlike the other one.\n\n395\n00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:41.190\nYou click on source formatting and then it\nturns into that font and the colors and\n\n396\n00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:43.790\nthen you're like, whoa, wait a second,\nwhat just happened here?\n\n397\n00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:45.960\n&gt;&gt; It went crazy [LAUGH].\n\n398\n00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:50.275\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's funny that\nyou mentioned all of like,\n\n399\n00:19:50.275 --> 00:19:52.140\nhow do I see everything in that column?\n\n400\n00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:57.790\nThis is an example of where the numbers,\nthere are numbers.\n\n401\n00:19:57.790 --> 00:19:58.600\nNumber sign.\n\n402\n00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.550\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; That live in this cell but\n\n403\n00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:03.640\nthe column isn't wide enough to be\nable to show all the information.\n\n404\n00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.130\n&gt;&gt; That's what that means okay?\n\n405\n00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:08.210\nSo if I just really quickly if I make that\nbigger, whoops, that's the wrong one.\n\n406\n00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:09.280\nHow about this one?\n\n407\n00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.200\nThen it shows up.\n\n408\n00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:14.160\nIt's saying that I have numbers in here,\nyou just can't see them right now.\n\n409\n00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.230\n&gt;&gt; It's just like symbolism to say there\nare numbers in here because here's\n\n410\n00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:21.050\nthe little number sign letting you know,\nI just can't fit it all on the page.\n\n411\n00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:23.388\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; It's interesting that they do that\n\n412\n00:20:23.388 --> 00:20:26.915\ninstead of just giving you whatever\nit can fit into that cell.\n\n413\n00:20:26.915 --> 00:20:31.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz it's not gonna change\nthe size of the font just to fit in it.\n\n414\n00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:33.564\nIt's you have to fit\nthe column to the information.\n\n415\n00:20:33.564 --> 00:20:34.341\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n416\n00:20:34.341 --> 00:20:38.651\n&gt;&gt; And it's not a hash tag,\nit's an actual number sign [LAUGH].\n\n417\n00:20:38.651 --> 00:20:40.244\nSo we've got that going on there.\n\n418\n00:20:40.244 --> 00:20:42.722\nOkay, cool, so\nthat was just a couple of paste option.\n\n419\n00:20:42.722 --> 00:20:46.642\nNow, my paste options have gone away,\nwhich is fine, we can always undo and\n\n420\n00:20:46.642 --> 00:20:50.502\nthen undo again and then paste it again,\nto get back to where we were because\n\n421\n00:20:50.502 --> 00:20:53.160\nthere's a couple different\nthings going on here.\n\n422\n00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:57.130\nI'm just going to keep the defaults for\nnow and click off of it because there\n\n423\n00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:01.945\nare things known as number formatting and\ncell formatting within your information.\n\n424\n00:21:01.945 --> 00:21:04.910\nNow we'll talk all about how\nto get it into this format,\n\n425\n00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:07.330\nbut this is a number format.\n\n426\n00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:11.300\nThis is a style, this is bold,\nthis is a style.\n\n427\n00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:14.270\nAll of these different things of\nhow this looks difference than just\n\n428\n00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:15.060\ntyping it all in.\n\n429\n00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:18.104\nAnd that's why these\npaste options have these.\n\n430\n00:21:18.104 --> 00:21:22.456\nIf I clicked on formulas,\nit's going to retain the formulas,\n\n431\n00:21:22.456 --> 00:21:24.680\nbut everything else goes away.\n\n432\n00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.560\nLook, all the bold goes off,\nall the fonts.\n\n433\n00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.930\nAll of the number formats.\n\n434\n00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:34.320\nThe decimal places and everything, dollars\nsigns, that stays away but the formulas,\n\n435\n00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:40.370\nlook at there, if I click on that one,\nit says sum of I4 through I7.\n\n436\n00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:44.986\nOkay, that's not just 140.13,\n\n437\n00:21:44.986 --> 00:21:49.090\nit's a calculation.\n\n438\n00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:53.640\nBut if I come into here, sometimes you\ndon't want it to retain the formulas.\n\n439\n00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.960\nI just want the values.\n\n440\n00:21:55.960 --> 00:22:00.510\nI want that to be 140.13 and\nhave nothing to do with the calculation.\n\n441\n00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:05.200\nIf I click this one,\nit doesn't look any different.\n\n442\n00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.940\nBut clicking on that and\nlooking at the formula bar,\n\n443\n00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:11.700\nit is no longer a calculation,\nit's no longer a formula.\n\n444\n00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:17.620\nSo you can keep paste values\ninstead of how it got there.\n\n445\n00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:20.150\nWhatever it says in the cell,\nthat's what I can do.\n\n446\n00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:24.310\nAnd then, of course,\nall those other options would be for,\n\n447\n00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:27.570\ndo you want to keep the formulas and\nthe number formatting?\n\n448\n00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:30.220\nDo I want to keep the source\nformatting and everything all there?\n\n449\n00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:31.350\nWe did that one.\n\n450\n00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:35.607\nThere's a couple more of the values and\nthe source formatting.\n\n451\n00:22:35.607 --> 00:22:37.700\nOkay, so\nyou have a lot of different options.\n\n452\n00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:41.600\nAnd once we start getting into what it\nactually means to have these different\n\n453\n00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.562\nformulas, it will make\na difference to you.\n\n454\n00:22:44.562 --> 00:22:48.220\nSo I'm just gonna paste one more time,\nand notice that my copy,\n\n455\n00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:48.890\nlet me back over here.\n\n456\n00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:50.800\nThat's not my key,\nI keep hitting the wrong one.\n\n457\n00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:51.505\nSorry guys!\n\n458\n00:22:51.505 --> 00:22:54.220\n[LAUGH]\nAlt.\n\n459\n00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:57.670\nYou see how my running\nants are still there?\n\n460\n00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:00.590\nThat means it's still\nremembering that copy.\n\n461\n00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:05.275\nSo it's gonna stay on and I can just keep\non pasting, pasting, pasting, pasting,\n\n462\n00:23:05.275 --> 00:23:11.090\npasting, until I'm ready to cancel that or\nselect something else, all right.\n\n463\n00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:14.690\nSo if I come over here, and\nthat's just over there for a reason and\n\n464\n00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:15.520\nI'll tell you in a second.\n\n465\n00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.930\nAll right, so if I come back over here,\nI'm using my Alt+Tab.\n\n466\n00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:24.300\nIf I wanna cancel, hey, let's stop\nthinking of this as my copied or\n\n467\n00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:28.480\nrange of cells, you just hit the Escape\nkey and the running ants will go away.\n\n468\n00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:32.225\nI had people in class like, I don't know,\nthese running ants won't stop.\n\n469\n00:23:32.225 --> 00:23:33.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm like, it's okay,\n\n470\n00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:37.542\nit's just letting you know it's still\nremembering the copy, just hit the Escape.\n\n471\n00:23:37.542 --> 00:23:39.840\nThose are like, okay, I'm done,\nthat's all I wanted to know.\n\n472\n00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.320\n&gt;&gt; I'm good to go,\ndon't need any more tutelage.\n\n473\n00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.768\nI know Excel like the back of my hand.\n\n474\n00:23:43.768 --> 00:23:46.260\n&gt;&gt; And these were when I was\nteaching whole day classes.\n\n475\n00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:48.080\nI'm like, but it's only 9:30,\nI've got so much more [LAUGH].\n\n476\n00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:52.367\nAnd there's usually another moment like,\nokay,\n\n477\n00:23:52.367 --> 00:23:55.903\nthat's good [LAUGH] All right, wonderful.\n\n478\n00:23:55.903 --> 00:23:59.686\nNow, if I can insert information\ninto this worksheet,\n\n479\n00:23:59.686 --> 00:24:04.514\nI also wanted to talk about deleting\nthe information out of this cell and\n\n480\n00:24:04.514 --> 00:24:09.423\nspecifically here Because I want to\nshow you how deleting the contents,\n\n481\n00:24:09.423 --> 00:24:15.136\nlike let's select over here, and I'm just\ngonna hit the delete key on my keyboard,\n\n482\n00:24:15.136 --> 00:24:21.180\nnot the backspace key but delete, and then\nit takes all of that information away.\n\n483\n00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:22.900\nAll right, simple enough.\n\n484\n00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:24.410\nLet's try this one.\n\n485\n00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:25.760\nSelect this, same thing.\n\n486\n00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:29.379\nThere's my delete and\nlike, wait a second but\n\n487\n00:24:29.379 --> 00:24:33.150\nit kind of looks like things are kind\nof hanging around there, aren't there?\n\n488\n00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:37.636\nYou see all the pink lines and\nif I came into here and typed in eight and\n\n489\n00:24:37.636 --> 00:24:41.530\nhit enter, wait,\nit's typing it is as $8.00.\n\n490\n00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:42.832\n&gt;&gt; So is that formatting that does that?\n\n491\n00:24:42.832 --> 00:24:48.371\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it is the cell formatting and all\nthe styles, everything is being retained,\n\n492\n00:24:48.371 --> 00:24:52.724\nso when you're deleting by using\nthe delete key on the keyboard,\n\n493\n00:24:52.724 --> 00:24:57.314\nyou're only deleting the contents and\nnot the formats of the cells,\n\n494\n00:24:57.314 --> 00:24:59.460\nwhich can drive people crazy.\n\n495\n00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:03.360\nThey're like I,\nit will not stop typing in $8.00.\n\n496\n00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:07.160\nI want it to just say 8, that's it.\n\n497\n00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.500\nYou gotta get rid of the formats.\n\n498\n00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:09.836\n&gt;&gt; So you uninstall Excel.\n\n499\n00:25:09.836 --> 00:25:11.959\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n500\n00:25:11.959 --> 00:25:12.568\n&gt;&gt; That might be a bit extreme.\n\n501\n00:25:12.568 --> 00:25:14.530\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; People will do that.\n\n502\n00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:16.170\nThey're like, I just close down Excel and\nI start all over.\n\n503\n00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:17.093\nI'm like, no, no, no, no.\n\n504\n00:25:17.093 --> 00:25:17.992\nYou don't have to do that.\n\n505\n00:25:17.992 --> 00:25:22.340\nSo I'm gonna do a control\nA to get everything selected.\n\n506\n00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:26.226\nI want not just the contents,\nI want everything to go away.\n\n507\n00:25:26.226 --> 00:25:29.930\nYou see over here on the home\ntab there is a clear.\n\n508\n00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:33.540\nDelete everything in cell or just\nremove the formats or the contents, or\n\n509\n00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:34.570\nthe comments, or the hyperlinks.\n\n510\n00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:36.280\nYou get to pick.\n\n511\n00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.368\nSo I could, this is another one.\n\n512\n00:25:38.368 --> 00:25:42.086\nI could keep all the contents,\nbut just take out the formats and\n\n513\n00:25:42.086 --> 00:25:43.950\nwatch what happens.\n\n514\n00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:48.132\nIt's all still there, it's just it's\nlike removed formatting in Word.\n\n515\n00:25:48.132 --> 00:25:50.289\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's fantastic if it's like I don't\n\n516\n00:25:50.289 --> 00:25:52.474\nlike the way it came in, I wanna redo it.\n\n517\n00:25:52.474 --> 00:25:56.746\nBut if I wanted to really get\nrid of all of these contents,\n\n518\n00:25:56.746 --> 00:26:00.671\nlike get rid of everything,\nyou go to the clear all.\n\n519\n00:26:00.671 --> 00:26:03.190\nWhen I clear all, okay.\n\n520\n00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:07.090\nNow if I type in this it will be 8 and\nit's not $8.00 anymore,\n\n521\n00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:09.980\nbecause I removed the contents and\nthe formats.\n\n522\n00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:13.302\nSo that's kind of a big\nthing to know about.\n\n523\n00:26:13.302 --> 00:26:16.360\nAgain, one of those small things that it\nmakes all the difference in the world.\n\n524\n00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.676\nOne last thing about copying and pasting.\n\n525\n00:26:19.676 --> 00:26:23.080\nBecause we're copying and pasting from\nExcel and talked about all the different\n\n526\n00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.732\npaste options with like the values,\nkeep the number formats,\n\n527\n00:26:25.732 --> 00:26:28.605\ndon't keep the number formats,\nsource, the blah, blah, blah.\n\n528\n00:26:28.605 --> 00:26:29.469\nBlah, blah, blah.\n\n529\n00:26:29.469 --> 00:26:30.206\nBlah, blah, blah.\n\n530\n00:26:30.206 --> 00:26:33.268\n[LAUGH] Copying from Word.\n\n531\n00:26:33.268 --> 00:26:37.940\nYeah, well, remember, Word and Excel are\nnot the same type of programs, are they?\n\n532\n00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:39.960\n&gt;&gt; But they're made by the same company,\nVonne.\n\n533\n00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:42.408\nSo they've got to work so\nwell with each other.\n\n534\n00:26:42.408 --> 00:26:43.920\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthey actually do a pretty good job.\n\n535\n00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:44.937\n&gt;&gt; They do do a pretty good job.\n\n536\n00:26:44.937 --> 00:26:46.074\n&gt;&gt; I will say that.\n\n537\n00:26:46.074 --> 00:26:49.050\nSo in here, in Word, I have paragraphs.\n\n538\n00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:51.410\nEvery time I hit the Enter key,\nI have a new paragraph.\n\n539\n00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:52.970\nSo I have character formatting.\n\n540\n00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:55.024\nI have water as H2O.\n\n541\n00:26:55.024 --> 00:26:58.028\nAnd I do have some of that\nlike local formatting or\n\n542\n00:26:58.028 --> 00:27:00.900\nsource formatting that I can pick or\nchoose.\n\n543\n00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:04.265\nI'm gonna select these paragraphs, okay?\n\n544\n00:27:04.265 --> 00:27:06.198\nI have one, two, three, four, five.\n\n545\n00:27:06.198 --> 00:27:07.480\nI have five paragraphs.\n\n546\n00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:08.090\nI'm gonna copy.\n\n547\n00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:11.890\nI'm gonna do control C, you're just\ngonna have to trust me that I did that.\n\n548\n00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:15.810\nCome back over here to book one and\n\n549\n00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:19.595\nI'm going to click in cell G4.\n\n550\n00:27:19.595 --> 00:27:20.889\nJust because.\n\n551\n00:27:20.889 --> 00:27:24.790\nI did not double click,\nI'm pointing that out to you.\n\n552\n00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:28.170\nI just do a control V and what did it do?\n\n553\n00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:34.430\nEvery time there was a paragraph,\nit put it in that cell and anything that\n\n554\n00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:39.630\nwas in that paragraph goes in there, and\nthe next paragraph is in the next cell.\n\n555\n00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:40.704\nSame thing here.\n\n556\n00:27:40.704 --> 00:27:42.566\nAnd I'm so\nglad you asked me those questions,\n\n557\n00:27:42.566 --> 00:27:44.830\nbecause it's tying right\ninto everything I'm doing.\n\n558\n00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:46.170\nIt's almost like you planned it.\n\n559\n00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:46.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but I didn't.\n\n560\n00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:48.120\n&gt;&gt; I know, we totally didn't.\n\n561\n00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.744\n&gt;&gt; it was a total coincidence.\n\n562\n00:27:49.744 --> 00:27:52.362\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So here, it went ahead and\n\n563\n00:27:52.362 --> 00:27:57.581\npasted that whole paragraph into\nthe cell and it put the word wrap on it.\n\n564\n00:27:57.581 --> 00:28:01.770\nAnd it automatically made the column\nwide enough to fit all of that content.\n\n565\n00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:02.672\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n566\n00:28:02.672 --> 00:28:04.990\nSo it does play nicely together.\n\n567\n00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:06.390\nAnd then we have another paragraph.\n\n568\n00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:10.570\nSo copying from Word into here, it's\ngoing to go like paragraph by paragraph,\n\n569\n00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:13.030\nand that's pretty cool.\n\n570\n00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:17.000\nNow in Word,\nyou do have options to do tables.\n\n571\n00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.650\nYou can make a table in Word such as this.\n\n572\n00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:23.924\nIf you come up and select the whole table,\nand now think about it,\n\n573\n00:28:23.924 --> 00:28:27.125\nit's already in a column and\nrow format in Word.\n\n574\n00:28:27.125 --> 00:28:33.500\nIf you select that table, copy it,\ncome over to Excel, come over to book one.\n\n575\n00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:36.840\nI'm just gonna scroll down into\na blank area, find a place.\n\n576\n00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:37.980\nHit the paste button.\n\n577\n00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:40.920\nIt's gonna go ahead and\nput all the cells in the table and\n\n578\n00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:45.650\nhave this table formatted the same way\nhere, with like the borders and the font.\n\n579\n00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:48.026\nYou do have,\nlet me scroll up a little bit,\n\n580\n00:28:48.026 --> 00:28:51.392\nyou do have that paste options\nhere to where you can still do,\n\n581\n00:28:51.392 --> 00:28:54.824\nnow notice here,\nsince it's not like workbook to workbook,\n\n582\n00:28:54.824 --> 00:28:59.318\nyou only only have paste with the source\nformatting or destination formatting.\n\n583\n00:28:59.318 --> 00:29:02.560\nMeaning I don't want the font,\nthe size, the borders.\n\n584\n00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:05.846\nIf I click that, now it's just text or,\nit's not text as text,\n\n585\n00:29:05.846 --> 00:29:08.760\nit's cells as cells, and just content.\n\n586\n00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:09.730\nPretty neat there.\n\n587\n00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:16.680\nIf I have tabular information in Word,\nbut one other thing to show you,\n\n588\n00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:20.290\nI said don't double click, I just\nsingle clicked in this cell and pasted.\n\n589\n00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:23.370\nWatch what happens, I'm just going\nto come over to a random one.\n\n590\n00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:29.341\nI double clicked, flashing cursor,\nnow if I past, it put all of the content,\n\n591\n00:29:29.341 --> 00:29:34.137\neven though it was in a table,\nIt just looked at it as like,\n\n592\n00:29:34.137 --> 00:29:38.321\nI'm just gonna put that into\nthat one cell and do this.\n\n593\n00:29:38.321 --> 00:29:40.300\nIt did a word wrap for me automatically.\n\n594\n00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:45.597\nBut that's how it's different than just\nselect a cell and paste directly into it.\n\n595\n00:29:45.597 --> 00:29:48.200\nAnd don't activate the flashing cursor.\n\n596\n00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:50.560\nSame thing as if I were doing the text.\n\n597\n00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:56.209\nIf I selected all of this text and\nI copy, come back over into the workbook.\n\n598\n00:29:56.209 --> 00:29:57.828\nLet's scroll down over here.\n\n599\n00:29:57.828 --> 00:30:02.000\nDouble click, flashing cursor, paste.\n\n600\n00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.400\nIt all goes into that one cell.\n\n601\n00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.468\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's horrible.\n\n602\n00:30:05.468 --> 00:30:08.381\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Versus taking each paragraph and\n\n603\n00:30:08.381 --> 00:30:10.400\nputting them into their own cell.\n\n604\n00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.950\nSo it's a very small thing.\n\n605\n00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:15.400\nA single click versus\na double click in a cell, but\n\n606\n00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:19.754\nit does do a pretty vast difference\nin the result of what you're\n\n607\n00:30:19.754 --> 00:30:23.303\ndoing when you're copying and\npasting from Word.\n\n608\n00:30:23.303 --> 00:30:26.990\nAnd like I said, from websites, just-\n&gt;&gt; Its even more sketch.\n\n609\n00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:29.902\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know with that one, just\nmake it a picture and put it in there.\n\n610\n00:30:29.902 --> 00:30:32.048\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's probably gonna to be a lot easier\n\n611\n00:30:32.048 --> 00:30:35.758\nand yeah, we do talk about importing web\ndata into Word, which is pretty awesome,\n\n612\n00:30:35.758 --> 00:30:38.467\nbut that's a totally different\nlevel in what you need to do.\n\n613\n00:30:38.467 --> 00:30:41.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a whole show unto itself,\nright Vonne?\n\n614\n00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:42.155\n&gt;&gt; It sure is.\n\n615\n00:30:42.155 --> 00:30:43.463\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n616\n00:30:43.463 --> 00:30:48.550\nWell Vonne, very interesting today with\nlooking at how we get data into the cells,\n\n617\n00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:50.320\nhow we can manipulate them,\nplay with that stuff.\n\n618\n00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:51.190\nVery, very cool stuff.\n\n619\n00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:53.430\nThere's many different ways\nin which we can do that.\n\n620\n00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:55.010\nSo I know I learned today.\n\n621\n00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:56.420\nHopefully you guys learned a lot.\n\n622\n00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.286\nI had my mind just [SOUND].\n\n623\n00:30:58.286 --> 00:30:59.527\nI should have worn a helmet.\n\n624\n00:30:59.527 --> 00:31:00.965\nIt was so awesome.\n\n625\n00:31:00.965 --> 00:31:04.035\nAnd Vonne, you are an awesome teacher,\nwe do thank you for spending your time and\n\n626\n00:31:04.035 --> 00:31:07.415\neffort on us, so\nthat we might be as cool as you one day.\n\n627\n00:31:07.415 --> 00:31:10.045\nThat being said, it looks like we\nare out of time for this episode,\n\n628\n00:31:10.045 --> 00:31:12.395\nwe do thank you folks out there for\nwatching.\n\n629\n00:31:12.395 --> 00:31:15.155\nSigning off for Office Pro TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n630\n00:31:15.155 --> 00:31:16.145\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n631\n00:31:16.145 --> 00:31:18.189\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH] You might need a helmet.\n\n30\n00:01:00.814 --> 00:01:02.143\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Because this is amazing.\n\n31\n00:01:02.143 --> 00:01:04.290\n&gt;&gt; I'll fashion one out\nof this paper I have.\n\n32\n00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.332\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Could be just raining\n\n33\n00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:07.156\namazingness.\n\n34\n00:01:07.156 --> 00:01:08.090\nAmazingness?\n\n35\n00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.642\nYou're ready cuz-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n36\n00:01:09.642 --> 00:01:11.082\n&gt;&gt; We're apparently also adding\nto the English language.\n\n37\n00:01:11.082 --> 00:01:12.778\n&gt;&gt; Hey, I always do so [LAUGH].\n\n38\n00:01:12.778 --> 00:01:14.680\nAll right, so we're gonna talk.\n\n39\n00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.600\nWell first,\nwe're gonna do a little review.\n\n40\n00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.760\nWe're just gonna talk about copying and\npasting, like we've done before.\n\n41\n00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.890\nSo I have a workbook that's ready\nto go called Navigator Workbook,\n\n42\n00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.250\nwhich we were using in another episode.\n\n43\n00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.799\nAnd we have things like active cell and\nmove here, which I realize,\n\n44\n00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.680\nI don't think I ever actually did.\n\n45\n00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.460\nI think it just said, you could\nmove something, and I didn't do it.\n\n46\n00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.099\n&gt;&gt; You made passing reference.\n\n47\n00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:36.887\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, probably, so\n\n48\n00:01:36.887 --> 00:01:39.477\nwhy don't we do an active reference and\ndo it?\n\n49\n00:01:39.477 --> 00:01:45.050\nIf I wanted to take any active cell,\nby getting my cell selector, oops, hello.\n\n50\n00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.010\nLet's go ahead and\nnot move my magic mouse too much.\n\n51\n00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.960\nWe have here.\n\n52\n00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.290\nWhen we get into the edges of an active\ncell, we get the four-pointed arrows, cuz\n\n53\n00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.600\nwe identified that when we were learning\nhow to navigate within a workflow.\n\n54\n00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.317\nSo when you get the four-pointed arrows\nand then you click hold, and drag,\n\n55\n00:02:03.317 --> 00:02:06.866\nyou are moving the content of\nthat cell to a new location.\n\n56\n00:02:06.866 --> 00:02:11.239\nAnd you can see there is a little tool\ntip down there that is letting me know\n\n57\n00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:12.324\nwhat cell I am in.\n\n58\n00:02:12.324 --> 00:02:16.549\nSo when I let go of my mouse,\nit will then move the cell\n\n59\n00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.477\ninformation to that location\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n\n60\n00:02:19.477 --> 00:02:20.335\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n61\n00:02:20.335 --> 00:02:21.235\nJust a quick little,\n\n62\n00:02:21.235 --> 00:02:24.644\nhey I wanna move this over, just grab\nthe four-pointed arrows and move it down.\n\n63\n00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:29.438\nAnd you can always get a chunk of stuff,\nand say cuz I need to, maybe,\n\n64\n00:02:29.438 --> 00:02:33.340\nmove it up, cuz I needed to\nput another content in here.\n\n65\n00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.993\n&gt;&gt; Another row there, or something.\n\n66\n00:02:33.993 --> 00:02:34.572\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n67\n00:02:34.572 --> 00:02:37.690\nSo if I could just grab it and\nmove it, it's a little bit easier.\n\n68\n00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.270\nI'm just doing Ctrl+Z, for\n\n69\n00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.131\nundo there, right now\n&gt;&gt; Seeing as the enter key doesn't\n\n70\n00:02:42.131 --> 00:02:43.981\nactually create a [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, yes\n\n71\n00:02:43.981 --> 00:02:45.170\n&gt;&gt; Right, it just moves down,\n\n72\n00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.465\nthat could be coming in handy.\n\n73\n00:02:46.465 --> 00:02:47.626\n&gt;&gt; Yes [LAUGH].\n\n74\n00:02:47.626 --> 00:02:50.462\nSo those are some different\nways of just moving, and\n\n75\n00:02:50.462 --> 00:02:53.627\nwe identified it but\nI didn't actually show it in action.\n\n76\n00:02:53.627 --> 00:02:57.715\nBut the reason why I wanted to go\nover the move and then now the copy,\n\n77\n00:02:57.715 --> 00:03:01.590\nis cuz I'm gonna show you how to move and\ncopy in one fail swoop.\n\n78\n00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.015\nWhich is probably one of my\nfavorite little shortcuts in Excel.\n\n79\n00:03:05.015 --> 00:03:08.950\nBut if we wanted to take this active\ncell and copy, we could do Ctrl+C or\n\n80\n00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:09.879\nright-click.\n\n81\n00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:14.650\nAnd then we can come over to our other\ncell and we can Ctrl+V or right-click.\n\n82\n00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.760\nAnd we did talk a lot about the different\npaste options that you have within Excel\n\n83\n00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.060\nwhen you're going from\nlike Excel to Excel.\n\n84\n00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.010\nAnd then we went from Word to Excel.\n\n85\n00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.832\nSo I can just paste it right there and\nthat's great.\n\n86\n00:03:24.832 --> 00:03:27.970\nNow, notice that they're running ants,\nkeep on there, they stay.\n\n87\n00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.887\nAnd that means that I could\ncome somewhere else and\n\n88\n00:03:30.887 --> 00:03:35.623\njust keep on pasting, cuz it's just\nremembering that particular active cell.\n\n89\n00:03:35.623 --> 00:03:39.592\nBut to cancel this,\nto say stop doing the running ants,\n\n90\n00:03:39.592 --> 00:03:43.070\njust hit the Esc key and then it stops it.\n\n91\n00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.060\nAll right, wonderful.\n\n92\n00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.510\nSo the move and copy.\n\n93\n00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.280\nWell, if you get to your\nedge of your active cell,\n\n94\n00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.790\nyou get that four-pointed arrow and\nyou hold your CTRL key.\n\n95\n00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.950\nI'm gonna try to zoom in to see if you\nguys can see this a little easier.\n\n96\n00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.950\nSee the mouse cursor icon there,\nI'm holding the CTRL key down.\n\n97\n00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.890\nDo you see how it turns\nto an arrow with a plus?\n\n98\n00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.060\nPlus meaning another?\n\n99\n00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.563\n&gt;&gt; Add something?\n\n100\n00:04:04.563 --> 00:04:05.443\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n101\n00:04:05.443 --> 00:04:07.830\n&gt;&gt; So if I click hold and drag and let go,\n\n102\n00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.399\nyou can see I've moved and copied.\n\n103\n00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:13.209\n&gt;&gt; It's getting even better\nas we go ladies and gents.\n\n104\n00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:14.778\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's just so cute.\n\n105\n00:04:14.778 --> 00:04:16.408\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So cute.\n&gt;&gt; And I love that shortcut and\n\n106\n00:04:16.408 --> 00:04:17.645\nI use it all the time.\n\n107\n00:04:17.645 --> 00:04:18.321\n&gt;&gt; It's like a pony.\n\n108\n00:04:18.321 --> 00:04:19.062\n&gt;&gt; All the time.\n\n109\n00:04:19.062 --> 00:04:19.819\n&gt;&gt; Or like a fuzzy puppy.\n\n110\n00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:21.616\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's so fuzzy.\n\n111\n00:04:21.616 --> 00:04:23.868\nSo, it's a fluffy.\n\n112\n00:04:23.868 --> 00:04:24.949\nIt's so fluffy.\n\n113\n00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:27.479\n&gt;&gt; You ever see a Bassett Hound puppy?\n\n114\n00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:28.352\nYou wanna see cute.\n\n115\n00:04:28.352 --> 00:04:30.115\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; My goodness.\n\n116\n00:04:30.115 --> 00:04:31.451\nWe ought to take a rest.\n\n117\n00:04:31.451 --> 00:04:32.170\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I know, yeah.\n\n118\n00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.812\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah we're talking about fluffy things\n\n119\n00:04:34.812 --> 00:04:35.980\nand puppies, okay.\n\n120\n00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.950\n&gt;&gt; So and again you could do this\nwith multiple ranges of cells.\n\n121\n00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.850\nSo if I, whoops that's the wrong key.\n\n122\n00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.244\nIf I go ahead and hold my CTRL key down,\nget the four-pointed arrows for\n\n123\n00:04:44.244 --> 00:04:46.560\nthe move, I can go ahead and\nmove that around.\n\n124\n00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.260\nYay, fun, awesome.\n\n125\n00:04:49.615 --> 00:04:55.125\nThe other thing we talked about in\nthe navigating Excel was the fill handle.\n\n126\n00:04:55.125 --> 00:04:57.605\nWe talked about how we\nhave our white plus sign.\n\n127\n00:04:57.605 --> 00:04:59.105\nWe have our four-pointed arrows.\n\n128\n00:04:59.105 --> 00:05:01.615\nAnd then the black plus sign,\nthe tiny little black\n\n129\n00:05:01.615 --> 00:05:05.025\nplus sign on the bottom right-hand corner,\nis known as a fill handle.\n\n130\n00:05:05.025 --> 00:05:08.475\nAnd I said when you drag it down,\nit does something.\n\n131\n00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:12.630\nWell, what it does by\ndefault is it copies?\n\n132\n00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.400\nSo I have this active cell, I come\ndown to the four-pointed arrows here.\n\n133\n00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.340\nAnd if I click, hold, and drag down, or\nacross, but you could see that a little\n\n134\n00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.470\ntool tip is saying, active cell,\nactive cell, when I let go, there you go.\n\n135\n00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.743\nThat's exactly what the fill handle\nis supposed to do by default,\n\n136\n00:05:30.743 --> 00:05:34.268\nis take whatever that information is and\ncopy it down.\n\n137\n00:05:34.268 --> 00:05:36.580\nNow, I could also copy it across.\n\n138\n00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.060\nSo it doesn't matter\nwhich direction you go.\n\n139\n00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.360\nIt's just knowing that the black\nplus sign will always copy\n\n140\n00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.360\nwhatever the content is in there.\n\n141\n00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.100\n&gt;&gt; And again really quick, how do we\nget the black plus sign up there?\n\n142\n00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.230\n&gt;&gt; That was when you get to the any\nactive cell, or a range of cells.\n\n143\n00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.597\nSo it could be a range,\nyou go to the bottom right hand corner\n\n144\n00:05:55.597 --> 00:05:56.376\n&gt;&gt; Bottom right hand corner\n\n145\n00:05:56.376 --> 00:05:57.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the kinda little, well,\n\n146\n00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.347\nit almost looks like\na little square down there.\n\n147\n00:05:59.347 --> 00:06:00.067\n&gt;&gt; Yes I see it.\n\n148\n00:06:00.067 --> 00:06:03.545\n&gt;&gt; And that will take you, cuz I can\ntake this and then drag it across and\n\n149\n00:06:03.545 --> 00:06:04.810\ncopy it, mm-hm yeah.\n\n150\n00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.080\nSo that's what it will always do.\n\n151\n00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.751\nNow, it copies but it also has some\nspecial functionality and some special\n\n152\n00:06:10.751 --> 00:06:15.661\ncopying, if you wanna say, especially\nwhen we start getting into formulas.\n\n153\n00:06:15.661 --> 00:06:18.897\nAnd when we talk about what's known as\nrelative reference, where it's copying\n\n154\n00:06:18.897 --> 00:06:21.720\nthe formula down but then it's\nchanging the reference as you go down.\n\n155\n00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.780\nIt's pretty awesome,\ncheck that out in our function series.\n\n156\n00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.630\nI think it's, functions essentials.\n\n157\n00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.080\nSo we have three levels of\nfunctions within Excel,\n\n158\n00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.550\ncuz there's a lot that Excel can do\nwhen we talk about calculations.\n\n159\n00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:39.318\nAll right, and the other thing it can\ndo with this fill handle, it copies.\n\n160\n00:06:39.318 --> 00:06:43.001\nBut it can not just copy content,\nit could copy just the formatting,\n\n161\n00:06:43.001 --> 00:06:46.100\nwhich we'll talk about in\nour formatting episode.\n\n162\n00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.870\nAnd the other thing it does, is it\nwill do what's known as a fill series.\n\n163\n00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.520\nAnd it goes by what\nare known as custom lists.\n\n164\n00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.440\nAnd as long as it identifies\nan element within that custom list,\n\n165\n00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.840\nit'll go ahead and create it.\n\n166\n00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.600\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n167\n00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.742\nLet me show you.\n\n168\n00:07:02.742 --> 00:07:05.120\nI'm gonna ahead and\nI'll just minimize this for now,\n\n169\n00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.410\nI don't think I need this anymore.\n\n170\n00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:11.491\nActually, well you know what, I need to\nbring back Excel and just do a CTRL+N for\n\n171\n00:07:11.491 --> 00:07:14.274\nFile New, cuz I wanna just get\nus a blank starting point.\n\n172\n00:07:14.274 --> 00:07:18.876\nSo fill series, yay, I love this,\nthis is another one of those,\n\n173\n00:07:18.876 --> 00:07:21.771\nI didn't know it could do that, all right?\n\n174\n00:07:21.771 --> 00:07:23.850\nDays of the week, all right?\n\n175\n00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:28.108\nIf I'm doing things that I'm always\nhaving to chart, track things, like\n\n176\n00:07:28.108 --> 00:07:33.057\nMonday through Friday, or Monday through\nSunday, maybe dates, months of the year.\n\n177\n00:07:33.057 --> 00:07:38.922\nHow many Basset Hound puppies were born\nin this month, and so on and so forth.\n\n178\n00:07:38.922 --> 00:07:40.466\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully a lot,\nbecause they're awesome.\n\n179\n00:07:40.466 --> 00:07:43.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm sure like a nice little\ngaggle of them flopping around.\n\n180\n00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:44.947\nIt'd be adorable.\n\n181\n00:07:44.947 --> 00:07:46.026\n&gt;&gt; Are they called a gaggle?\n\n182\n00:07:46.026 --> 00:07:46.828\nI guess so, yeah.\n\n183\n00:07:46.828 --> 00:07:47.722\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna call it a gaggle.\n\n184\n00:07:47.722 --> 00:07:50.652\n&gt;&gt; Yeah we're gonna go with that,\ngaggle, cool, we like.\n\n185\n00:07:50.652 --> 00:07:54.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So we just go ahead and\ntype in one of our first days.\n\n186\n00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:58.887\nLet's start with Monday,\nall right, perfect.\n\n187\n00:07:58.887 --> 00:08:00.239\nNow I'm not even done typing.\n\n188\n00:08:00.239 --> 00:08:02.337\nSee my flashing cursor's still in there.\n\n189\n00:08:02.337 --> 00:08:05.826\nIt doesn't matter if you had entered and\nthen came back to the cell, or\n\n190\n00:08:05.826 --> 00:08:07.848\nkept your flashing cursor in that cell.\n\n191\n00:08:07.848 --> 00:08:12.788\nIf you come to the little black plus sign,\nthat fill handle and\n\n192\n00:08:12.788 --> 00:08:14.790\nyou drag down and let go.\n\n193\n00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:16.868\nTa da, it fills in.\n\n194\n00:08:16.868 --> 00:08:18.425\n&gt;&gt; It just knew to do that automatically.\n\n195\n00:08:18.425 --> 00:08:21.745\nYou didn't have to say hey\nwe're doing a series fill?\n\n196\n00:08:21.745 --> 00:08:26.842\nIt just said you put Monday here obviously\nyou want Tuesday right after that.\n\n197\n00:08:26.842 --> 00:08:30.454\nNow I guess that begs the question what\nif I did want Monday, Monday, Monday,\n\n198\n00:08:30.454 --> 00:08:31.348\nMonday, Monday?\n\n199\n00:08:31.348 --> 00:08:37.188\n&gt;&gt;

Tip of the iceberg here.\n\n225\n00:09:43.287 --> 00:09:44.117\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n226\n00:09:44.117 --> 00:09:46.532\n&gt;&gt; So there's some neat things\nthat you can do with that.\n\n227\n00:09:46.532 --> 00:09:50.087\nAnd this is where I told you about\nhow it does the copying, but\n\n228\n00:09:50.087 --> 00:09:52.267\nit could also fill formatting only.\n\n229\n00:09:52.267 --> 00:09:55.970\nThat's where if you had like a word\nI'm not looking to copy or anything.\n\n230\n00:09:55.970 --> 00:10:00.185\nI just wanna say take the format and copy\nthat down, you could use that as options.\n\n231\n00:10:00.185 --> 00:10:03.819\nThese options on the autofills are really,\nreally handy.\n\n232\n00:10:03.819 --> 00:10:05.642\nNow, I started with Monday.\n\n233\n00:10:05.642 --> 00:10:08.960\nWell, what if for some reason I\nneeded to start with Wednesday?\n\n234\n00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:09.941\nI don't start on Monday.\n\n235\n00:10:09.941 --> 00:10:11.915\nAnd I don't want to do the full words.\n\n236\n00:10:11.915 --> 00:10:15.980\nCuz we usually abbreviate with a W-E-D for\nWednesday.\n\n237\n00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.615\nAnd I'm capitalizing it just\nto show you another variation.\n\n238\n00:10:18.615 --> 00:10:21.008\nTake that, click-hold and drag across.\n\n239\n00:10:21.008 --> 00:10:25.068\nAnd notice that that little tooltip is\ncoming up to say if I wanted to go from\n\n240\n00:10:25.068 --> 00:10:28.159\nWednesday to Wednesday,\nyou let go, and there you go.\n\n241\n00:10:28.159 --> 00:10:33.048\nSo it's any one within that\nlist cuz it is in order.\n\n242\n00:10:33.048 --> 00:10:34.721\nThat's Monday, Tuesday,\nWednesday, Thursday.\n\n243\n00:10:34.721 --> 00:10:38.216\nYou see one, it'll go ahead and\nkeep on going and then repeat the list.\n\n244\n00:10:38.216 --> 00:10:41.327\n&gt;&gt; You're making me\na convert into liking Excel.\n\n245\n00:10:41.327 --> 00:10:43.800\nThis is getting better for\nme, I have to admit.\n\n246\n00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.587\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't make me cry.\n\n247\n00:10:45.587 --> 00:10:47.423\n[LAUGH] You know I'm emotional.\n\n248\n00:10:47.423 --> 00:10:48.189\n&gt;&gt; Hold it back Vonne.\n\n249\n00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:50.930\n[LAUGH] Bite your hand.\n\n250\n00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:53.872\n&gt;&gt; So that's really cool that\nyou can do all these things now.\n\n251\n00:10:53.872 --> 00:10:56.410\nDays of the week, months of the year.\n\n252\n00:10:56.410 --> 00:11:01.815\nSo what if I said JAN,\nand then pulled that down?\n\n253\n00:11:01.815 --> 00:11:02.443\n[CROSSTALK] No.\n\n254\n00:11:02.443 --> 00:11:03.059\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n255\n00:11:03.059 --> 00:11:05.288\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwe can go all the way to December.\n\n256\n00:11:05.288 --> 00:11:10.594\nBut if I needed to just be copying that,\nthen I can do that.\n\n257\n00:11:10.594 --> 00:11:12.734\nAll right, so\nwe have those different options.\n\n258\n00:11:12.734 --> 00:11:17.595\nAnd you could put it in cause maybe your\nfiscal year goes from July through, well,\n\n259\n00:11:17.595 --> 00:11:20.095\nlet's make sure we spell July properly.\n\n260\n00:11:20.095 --> 00:11:24.173\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then we go across to June.\n\n261\n00:11:24.173 --> 00:11:25.079\nThere we go.\n\n262\n00:11:25.079 --> 00:11:29.502\nAnd now I have all the months of the year\ngoing ahead and populating there.\n\n263\n00:11:29.502 --> 00:11:35.010\nSo these are the four default\ncustom lists that come with Excel,\n\n264\n00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.152\nthe months and the days.\n\n265\n00:11:37.152 --> 00:11:39.103\nSo those are pretty neat.\n\n266\n00:11:39.103 --> 00:11:41.912\nNow what about things like numbering?\n\n267\n00:11:41.912 --> 00:11:44.595\nThere's a lot of types that\nwe have to do those things.\n\n268\n00:11:44.595 --> 00:11:47.498\nAnd in Access, the the primary key.\n\n269\n00:11:47.498 --> 00:11:49.984\nA lot of times it does\nthe auto numbering type thing.\n\n270\n00:11:49.984 --> 00:11:50.749\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n271\n00:11:50.749 --> 00:11:53.791\n&gt;&gt; I need to have that here in Excel.\n\n272\n00:11:53.791 --> 00:11:56.600\nI shouldn't probably use\nthe primary key [INAUDIBLE].\n\n273\n00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.959\nWe don't wanna confuse that.\n\n274\n00:11:57.959 --> 00:12:01.837\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Databases versus Excel,\nit's not the same thing.\n\n275\n00:12:01.837 --> 00:12:03.845\n&gt;&gt; But\nwe're just creating a list of information.\n\n276\n00:12:03.845 --> 00:12:04.983\nSo let's type in the number one.\n\n277\n00:12:04.983 --> 00:12:05.586\n&gt;&gt; One is a primary.\n\n278\n00:12:05.586 --> 00:12:08.361\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you're thinking, my gosh.\n\n279\n00:12:08.361 --> 00:12:09.081\nI'm so excited.\n\n280\n00:12:09.081 --> 00:12:10.799\nSo let's go ahead and pull this down.\n\n281\n00:12:10.799 --> 00:12:13.447\nAnd well, it didn't work.\n\n282\n00:12:13.447 --> 00:12:14.306\n&gt;&gt; It does the old copy.\n\n283\n00:12:14.306 --> 00:12:16.523\n&gt;&gt; It does cuz that's its first job.\n\n284\n00:12:16.523 --> 00:12:20.969\nBut because it knows hey,\nthere's a number in there.\n\n285\n00:12:20.969 --> 00:12:25.158\nIf I choose this to go to fill series,\nbloop, I can go ahead and\n\n286\n00:12:25.158 --> 00:12:30.573\nhave automatic numbering by just using\nthat fill series right on down there so.\n\n287\n00:12:30.573 --> 00:12:32.965\nAnd this can be used in\nconjunction with text.\n\n288\n00:12:32.965 --> 00:12:38.164\nSo let's say we have Project one.\n\n289\n00:12:38.164 --> 00:12:40.625\nAnd I'm just using that as an example.\n\n290\n00:12:40.625 --> 00:12:44.643\nPull that down, now that\nautomatically see's it as a sequence.\n\n291\n00:12:44.643 --> 00:12:47.452\n&gt;&gt; That's because it's more than\njust having the number there, right?\n\n292\n00:12:47.452 --> 00:12:50.216\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nit's just like you have some words.\n\n293\n00:12:50.216 --> 00:12:52.410\nAnd remember this,\nwhere I had this like hello world?\n\n294\n00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.337\nYou don't think I typed those numbers in,\ndid you?\n\n295\n00:12:54.337 --> 00:12:55.544\nSure did.\n\n296\n00:12:55.544 --> 00:12:56.160\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n297\n00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.971\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well now you know I didn't.\n\n298\n00:12:57.971 --> 00:13:02.581\nIt is used the fill series and\nit made it a lot easier for\n\n299\n00:13:02.581 --> 00:13:04.849\nme to go ahead and do that.\n\n300\n00:13:04.849 --> 00:13:05.884\nBut, of course,\n\n301\n00:13:05.884 --> 00:13:10.438\nyou can always switch it back into I need\nyou to be copying Project one cause I'm\n\n302\n00:13:10.438 --> 00:13:14.457\ntracking certain things within\nProject one, and so on and so forth.\n\n303\n00:13:14.457 --> 00:13:15.537\n&gt;&gt; Vonne, I just realized something.\n\n304\n00:13:15.537 --> 00:13:18.034\nI'm gonna know Excel by the end\nof this series, aren't I?\n\n305\n00:13:18.034 --> 00:13:20.077\n&gt;&gt; I hope that's a plan.\n\n306\n00:13:20.077 --> 00:13:22.452\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And I'll be responsible for\n\n307\n00:13:22.452 --> 00:13:24.291\npeople to go, hey,\nI've got this Excel issue.\n\n308\n00:13:24.291 --> 00:13:24.976\nDo you think you can?\n\n309\n00:13:24.976 --> 00:13:25.939\nYes I can help you.\n\n310\n00:13:25.939 --> 00:13:27.995\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Now I can't do that.\n\n311\n00:13:27.995 --> 00:13:29.191\nNope, I don't know anything about it.\n\n312\n00:13:29.191 --> 00:13:31.984\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right now I can just\nkinda claim ignorance and,\n\n313\n00:13:31.984 --> 00:13:34.325\nthose days are numbered though apparently.\n\n314\n00:13:34.325 --> 00:13:35.881\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Speaking of numbers,\n\n315\n00:13:35.881 --> 00:13:37.472\nwhat if I need a sequence?\n\n316\n00:13:37.472 --> 00:13:38.354\n&gt;&gt; Here, because right here.\n\n317\n00:13:38.354 --> 00:13:40.787\n&gt;&gt; How many days before\nDaniel is competent in Excel?\n\n318\n00:13:40.787 --> 00:13:42.227\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n319\n00:13:42.227 --> 00:13:43.132\n&gt;&gt; We could write a formula for that.\n\n320\n00:13:43.132 --> 00:13:46.745\n[LAUGH] But if I had, say,\nwe're counting by fives,\n\n321\n00:13:46.745 --> 00:13:49.219\ninstead of counting by ones there.\n\n322\n00:13:49.219 --> 00:13:52.168\nSo I wanted to do five.\n\n323\n00:13:52.168 --> 00:13:54.908\nNow you have to give it the increment,\nokay?\n\n324\n00:13:54.908 --> 00:13:57.648\nSo I'm gonna start up here just to\nmake it a little easier for us to see.\n\n325\n00:13:57.648 --> 00:13:59.242\nWe're gonna do 5, Enter.\n\n326\n00:13:59.242 --> 00:14:04.874\n10, Enter, so I'm putting two\ncells that have that iteration.\n\n327\n00:14:04.874 --> 00:14:06.534\nSo now we're counting by fives.\n\n328\n00:14:06.534 --> 00:14:10.621\nYou have to select both first, okay?\n\n329\n00:14:10.621 --> 00:14:12.408\nSo you have to kind of\nthink of it in steps.\n\n330\n00:14:12.408 --> 00:14:13.884\nI mean the select, let go.\n\n331\n00:14:13.884 --> 00:14:17.392\nNow get the black plus sign and\ndrag down and\n\n332\n00:14:17.392 --> 00:14:22.185\nthen it will see that sequence and\nbe able to count by that.\n\n333\n00:14:22.185 --> 00:14:25.597\nSo if you were counting by twos,\nby fives, by tens, by 100s,\n\n334\n00:14:25.597 --> 00:14:27.843\nwhat have you,\nyou can go ahead and set it.\n\n335\n00:14:27.843 --> 00:14:32.661\nBut you set it first,\nthen you select it and then you autofill.\n\n336\n00:14:32.661 --> 00:14:35.518\nCause I have a lot of\npeople they'll go here and\n\n337\n00:14:35.518 --> 00:14:38.019\nthen they'll just click hold and drag.\n\n338\n00:14:38.019 --> 00:14:38.902\nIt's like, nope.\n\n339\n00:14:38.902 --> 00:14:40.365\nNope, it doesn't work that way.\n\n340\n00:14:40.365 --> 00:14:44.547\nYou gotta like recognize it first,\nand then fill it down.\n\n341\n00:14:44.547 --> 00:14:48.725\nSo you can do your sequence of numbers,\nwhich is pretty,\n\n342\n00:14:48.725 --> 00:14:51.606\npretty handy, like all of that stuff.\n\n343\n00:14:51.606 --> 00:14:55.260\nNow I told you that these\nare from custom lists, so\n\n344\n00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:59.524\nif there's some default custom lists,\ncan I make my own?\n\n345\n00:14:59.524 --> 00:15:00.801\n&gt;&gt; I would think you could.\n\n346\n00:15:00.801 --> 00:15:05.647\n&gt;&gt; You can [LAUGH] and I've had some\nexamples throughout the years of\n\n347\n00:15:05.647 --> 00:15:10.414\npeople saying what was it all\nthe counties in Florida, right?\n\n348\n00:15:10.414 --> 00:15:12.318\nThey're always having\nto list them all down.\n\n349\n00:15:12.318 --> 00:15:15.625\nI think there's 67 counties or 62 or 57.\n\n350\n00:15:15.625 --> 00:15:16.414\n&gt;&gt; 67 I think.\n\n351\n00:15:16.414 --> 00:15:17.053\n&gt;&gt; Is it 67?\n\n352\n00:15:17.053 --> 00:15:17.691\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n353\n00:15:17.691 --> 00:15:23.806\nAnd it always starts with Alatchua, so\nthey'd type in Alatchua and fill on down\n\n354\n00:15:23.806 --> 00:15:27.475\nand go all the way to something with a w,\n\n355\n00:15:27.475 --> 00:15:28.619\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n356\n00:15:28.619 --> 00:15:30.234\n&gt;&gt; I know this actually because\n\n357\n00:15:30.234 --> 00:15:34.145\nI worked at the Florida Farm Bureau,\nwhich is an insurance company.\n\n358\n00:15:34.145 --> 00:15:35.770\nWe have an office in every county.\n\n359\n00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:38.234\nAnd it's weird.\n\n360\n00:15:38.234 --> 00:15:40.568\n&gt;&gt; There's an S and a K and an A in there.\n\n361\n00:15:40.568 --> 00:15:42.935\n&gt;&gt; And what's weird is there's\na county that's that name and\n\n362\n00:15:42.935 --> 00:15:46.024\nit's in the northern part of the state,\nand there's a city by the same name.\n\n363\n00:15:46.024 --> 00:15:47.641\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; That's in the middle of the state.\n\n364\n00:15:47.641 --> 00:15:49.183\n&gt;&gt; It's very weird.\n\n365\n00:15:49.183 --> 00:15:50.578\nIt always [INAUDIBLE] what\nis the name of that county?\n\n366\n00:15:50.578 --> 00:15:51.159\nGo.\n\n367\n00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:51.691\nI'll find out.\n\n368\n00:15:51.691 --> 00:15:52.424\nYou continue.\n\n369\n00:15:52.424 --> 00:15:53.706\n&gt;&gt;

I like how general is scroll away,\nway at the bottom, not right at the top.\n\n395\n00:16:56.745 --> 00:16:59.623\n&gt;&gt; Well, I love that there's general and\nadvanced, but then there's a general-\n\n396\n00:16:59.623 --> 00:17:00.147\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n\n403\n00:17:16.436 --> 00:17:17.396\n&gt;&gt; I forgot to take it out, so\n\n404\n00:17:17.396 --> 00:17:18.365\nyou could see right here.\n\n405\n00:17:18.365 --> 00:17:20.508\n&gt;&gt; That will save you some typing.\n\n406\n00:17:20.508 --> 00:17:23.037\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt;

Very cool, Vonne, very cool.\n\n435\n00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:51.620\n&gt;&gt; Now instead of typing all the ones in,\nso let's just do,\n\n436\n00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:55.705\nI'm just gonna type in\nsomething really quick.\n\n437\n00:18:55.705 --> 00:18:58.746\nAnd hello, okay, well, let's just\nkeep it that way, all right, perfect.\n\n438\n00:18:58.746 --> 00:19:03.525\nSo I've got it all typed in,\nI wanna make this my list.\n\n439\n00:19:03.525 --> 00:19:09.420\nIf you select it first, okay,\nnow notice this is J12 through J15.\n\n440\n00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:13.080\nSo let's go back over into our Options.\n\n441\n00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:18.480\nI'm going a little faster, just so\nI can get there, Edit Custom Lists.\n\n442\n00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.041\nAnd now, you can see that right there,\n\n443\n00:19:21.041 --> 00:19:26.019\nit's already referencing that selection\nthat I had made before I got here.\n\n444\n00:19:26.019 --> 00:19:32.040\nThat absolute reference, that's that\ndollar sign, always do this, this.\n\n445\n00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.890\nNow, it doesn't mean it's always\ngonna reference its cells.\n\n446\n00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:36.030\nYou can see the button right there,\n\n447\n00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:38.088\nI'm pointing at my computer like\nyou can see me pointing [LAUGH].\n\n448\n00:19:38.088 --> 00:19:42.520\nRight here, there's an Import\nbutton that will import that list.\n\n449\n00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:45.890\nSo it doesn't have to do anything\nwith the cell reference anymore.\n\n450\n00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:50.660\nIt's just for\nme getting the list into my custom list.\n\n451\n00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:56.283\nAnd now you can see if I type in\nthe word for and then pull across,\n\n452\n00:19:56.283 --> 00:20:01.520\nit will recognize that as\nmy particular custom list.\n\n453\n00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:06.363\nSo, pretty fun stuff that you can do with\nyour fill series and your fill handle.\n\n454\n00:20:06.363 --> 00:20:10.516\nOkay, so now,\n[LAUGH] let's talk about flash fill.\n\n455\n00:20:10.516 --> 00:20:11.876\nI'm serious, I'm so\n\n456\n00:20:11.876 --> 00:20:16.286\nexcited about this because it's just, it-\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I have flash fill.\n\n480\n00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.360\nSo let me give you some\nexamples if you're like,\n\n481\n00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:20.770\nI don't understand what\nyou're talking about.\n\n482\n00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:24.554\nSo right here, and this might be something\nthat a lot of people have to do where you\n\n483\n00:21:24.554 --> 00:21:26.852\nhave something where it has first and\nlast name.\n\n484\n00:21:26.852 --> 00:21:29.570\nAnd they're in two separate columns.\n\n485\n00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:35.920\nBut you need to combine them together\nto have it say Bishop Timothy,\n\n486\n00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:39.730\nGeorgette Whiskers, Belle Darling,\nthat type of stuff.\n\n487\n00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:41.160\nOkay, here we go.\n\n488\n00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:44.360\nAll you have to do,\ntype in the first one, right?\n\n489\n00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:48.900\nBishop, space, Timothy,\nand watch what happens.\n\n490\n00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:52.450\nWhen I hit Enter, you're like,\nthat didn't do anything, Vonne.\n\n491\n00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:53.820\nI know, but watch the next one.\n\n492\n00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:58.640\nIf I start typing in Georgette, all I\nhad to type in was the G in Georgette,\n\n493\n00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.310\nand look at what it did.\n\n494\n00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:04.870\nThat list, it says, wait, I see a pattern,\nyou did this in the first one.\n\n495\n00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:07.880\nYou want me to concatenate everything\nthat was in that first cell\n\n496\n00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.760\nnext to the next cell,\nI hit Enter, and then poop.\n\n497\n00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:14.700\n&gt;&gt; That is utter magic, right there.\n\n498\n00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:19.230\nI hope on the other end of the screen,\nI'm stuttering, I'm completely shocked and\n\n499\n00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:20.430\namazed at that.\n\n500\n00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:21.670\nThat is stinking cool.\n\n501\n00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:22.410\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n502\n00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:26.847\nYeah, and this would be where you\nwould have to write a formula to say,\n\n503\n00:22:26.847 --> 00:22:32.060\ntake whatever's in A1, concatenate it\nwith B2, and then go ahead and do that.\n\n504\n00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:34.559\nAnd then you'd have to do the formula,\nand then you'd have to copy it, and\n\n505\n00:22:34.559 --> 00:22:36.238\nthen you'd have to paste\nit into another column.\n\n506\n00:22:36.238 --> 00:22:38.517\n&gt;&gt; Do it again, let's just-\n&gt;&gt; I've got more.\n\n507\n00:22:38.517 --> 00:22:40.672\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I've got another variation, so\n\n508\n00:22:40.672 --> 00:22:44.582\nwhat if I need, okay, the first letter of\ntheir first name and then their last name?\n\n509\n00:22:44.582 --> 00:22:48.191\nSo that would be B Timothy, right?\n\n510\n00:22:48.191 --> 00:22:50.463\nOkay, I'm gonna do it a different\nway just to show you.\n\n511\n00:22:50.463 --> 00:22:56.260\nI'm gonna do that fill handle again here,\nbut I don't want to copy.\n\n512\n00:22:56.260 --> 00:23:00.990\nThere is an option in your\nsmart tag that says flash fill.\n\n513\n00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:02.360\nI click that, bloop.\n\n514\n00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:03.885\n&gt;&gt; My goodness.\n\n515\n00:23:03.885 --> 00:23:04.385\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n516\n00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.466\n&gt;&gt; Excel is Skynet, apparently,\nit's that smart, it's that awesome.\n\n517\n00:23:08.466 --> 00:23:10.296\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is pretty cool,\n\n518\n00:23:10.296 --> 00:23:15.080\nnow there are some situations, like for\nexample, look at this one down here.\n\n519\n00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:21.168\nIf I look at Cafe Mocha, right, oops,\nsorry, so she has a double first name,\n\n520\n00:23:21.168 --> 00:23:25.895\nokay, and then Cafe Mocha Cup\ncuz that's her last name.\n\n521\n00:23:25.895 --> 00:23:31.125\nNotice that with this one, it worked\njust fine, but it said Cafe M Cup.\n\n522\n00:23:31.125 --> 00:23:35.050\nCuz if you think about it, what was the\npattern, they're saying okay, whatever's\n\n523\n00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:38.937\nin this cell that's closest to the next\ncolumn, right, so Mocha is closest to Cup.\n\n524\n00:23:38.937 --> 00:23:40.159\nSo that's what it's gonna become.\n\n525\n00:23:40.159 --> 00:23:43.573\nIt didn't do C, or it didn't do CM,\n\n526\n00:23:43.573 --> 00:23:47.990\nright, it didn't be able to differentiate-\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n527\n00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:50.097\nthen there's some logic\ngoing on behind there.\n\n528\n00:23:50.097 --> 00:23:53.654\nAnd as long as we're aware\nof how that logic works,\n\n529\n00:23:53.654 --> 00:23:57.394\nwe can predict what we're\ngonna have as our outcome.\n\n530\n00:23:57.394 --> 00:23:59.742\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthe thing that you do have to have.\n\n531\n00:23:59.742 --> 00:24:02.872\nI mean, your data has to be Formatted.\n\n532\n00:24:02.872 --> 00:24:08.461\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it has to be in a certain wave for\nit to do this so seamlessly.\n\n533\n00:24:08.461 --> 00:24:11.950\n&gt;&gt; And this is common like as I've\nworked in systems administration,\n\n534\n00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:16.870\npeople's names can be generally kind\nof a pain unless they're standard.\n\n535\n00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:18.790\nYou know,\nJohn Smith very easy to work with.\n\n536\n00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:22.660\nBut when you get into May Beth Kinosh.\n\n537\n00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:27.480\n&gt;&gt; It's okay is it or what if you\nhave two people of the same name.\n\n538\n00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:28.140\n&gt;&gt; Then what do you do?\n\n539\n00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:29.690\nThat's when things can get hinky.\n\n540\n00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:31.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah exact, a hyphenated last names.\n\n541\n00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:34.440\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I mean I know people that have double\n\n542\n00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:35.050\nfirst names.\n\n543\n00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:40.510\nIt's usually with a hyphen But\nit could be two full names,\n\n544\n00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:43.900\nso it does depend on how that all works.\n\n545\n00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:50.006\nSo, I think I knew someone with a, yes, it\nwas De La Salas, that was his last name.\n\n546\n00:24:50.006 --> 00:24:52.686\n[CROSSTALK] But\nit was three individual words.\n\n547\n00:24:52.686 --> 00:24:56.065\n&gt;&gt; I knew a kid in high school,\nhis name was.\n\n548\n00:24:56.065 --> 00:24:58.995\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We call him Dave.\n\n549\n00:24:58.995 --> 00:25:00.180\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's awesome.\n\n550\n00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:01.760\nThat's a big one.\n\n551\n00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.930\n&gt;&gt; That's a big one, yeah.\n\n552\n00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:07.000\n&gt;&gt; So this functionality of\nthe Flash Fill is amazing.\n\n553\n00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.440\nSo if I wanna take the first letter and\nthen the last letter or wait,\n\n554\n00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:17.140\nthe first letter of each of their first\nand last name and then you take this down.\n\n555\n00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:21.240\nAnd I'm gonna do another way if were I can\ngo ahead and I'll ever do is shift click\n\n556\n00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:27.010\nto the last entry and\nup on the home tab there is a fill and\n\n557\n00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:33.340\nit's called flash fill and you can see it\ndoes it again, all different variations.\n\n558\n00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:36.580\nI wanna do their last name, comma, first.\n\n559\n00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:39.120\nTimothy, comma, space, Bishop.\n\n560\n00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.010\nThere we go.\n\n561\n00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:43.240\nAnd I'll do the same thing here.\n\n562\n00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:46.630\nI wanna do a keyboard shortcut,\nwhich is Ctrl+E,\n\n563\n00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:50.070\nand that does it as well, so amazing.\n\n564\n00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:53.698\nEspecially when you have all these\nvariable lengths of words and names.\n\n565\n00:25:53.698 --> 00:25:55.630\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty mind-blowing.\n\n566\n00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:57.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's amazing.\n\n567\n00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:00.990\nSo just some other examples so you can\njust kinda see the whole scope of that so\n\n568\n00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:04.270\nthink you're getting the idea,\nand it's almost too easy.\n\n569\n00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:07.460\nRight, so now this list, by the way,\nI got from that project, Gutenberg.\n\n570\n00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:11.860\nIt's like the most downloaded for\neither the day or the month or something.\n\n571\n00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:14.210\nSo I'm assuming that those numbers\nin parenthesis would be like,\n\n572\n00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:18.260\nnumber of downloads,\nbecause they do go sorting downwards.\n\n573\n00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:24.160\nSo I just want to pull out the number,\n563 Got the idea.\n\n574\n00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.020\nShift,+click+Ctrl+E, bloop done.\n\n575\n00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:28.400\nOkay, pull it all out.\n\n576\n00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:33.780\nPull out the first word of this list,\ndrag down.\n\n577\n00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:36.060\nOops, don't wanna do that.\n\n578\n00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:37.810\nI want to do the flash fill.\n\n579\n00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:40.720\nThere we go.\n\n580\n00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.180\nPretty, pretty neat.\n\n581\n00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:43.310\nI can do the last word.\n\n582\n00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:45.970\n&gt;&gt; This is really cool.\n\n583\n00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:47.000\n&gt;&gt; Adventures.\n\n584\n00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:52.460\nDo the same thing.\n\n585\n00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:54.310\nThen we Ctrl+E.\n\n586\n00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:56.610\nThat's just crazy.\n\n587\n00:26:56.610 --> 00:27:00.340\nIt's recognizing the second word.\n\n588\n00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:01.770\nOf these titles.\n\n589\n00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:05.540\nNow do notice here on Beowulf right here,\ngod, I remember reading that.\n\n590\n00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:08.660\n&gt;&gt; It thinks 253 I guess is the-\n&gt;&gt; The next word.\n\n591\n00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:13.230\n&gt;&gt; So, apparently what it's doing is that\nit's saying any space is a delimiter.\n\n592\n00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:15.130\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; So every time you have a space,\n\n593\n00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:19.860\nthe second thing there, that's the second\nfield, therefore that is the second word.\n\n594\n00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:22.660\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah, so that's where, again,\n\n595\n00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:27.050\nhow your data is shown,\nit does make a difference, though.\n\n596\n00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:31.670\nAnd again, you can have your last word,\ncomma, and\n\n597\n00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:37.290\nthen the Number of downloads\nshift click control e and\n\n598\n00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:43.150\nit does it, so simple,\nbut yet does it so well.\n\n599\n00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:45.660\nThis is part of an intelligent\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n600\n00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:48.395\n&gt;&gt; You know, these programs getting more\n&gt;&gt; More smart.\n\n601\n00:27:48.395 --> 00:27:49.913\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nMore smarter.\n\n602\n00:27:49.913 --> 00:27:50.430\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Yeah.\n\n603\n00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:54.990\nMore smarter for us so they can help us\nout in using that intelligent service but\n\n604\n00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:57.950\nthis was actually around\nin Excel 2003 as well.\n\n605\n00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:02.600\nSo, I didn't know that and\nI was working on 2013.\n\n606\n00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:03.850\nDid I just say three?\n\n607\n00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:04.505\n&gt;&gt; Three yeah.\n\n608\n00:28:04.505 --> 00:28:05.160\n&gt;&gt; I meant 13.\n\n609\n00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.070\nI'm sorry.\n\n610\n00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:09.950\nIt had a 3 in it,\nI just needed to put a 1 in front of it.\n\n611\n00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:13.450\nSo, 2013 but I,\nit's one of those, even for me.\n\n612\n00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:16.950\nI've been teaching this stuff for\na long time and all that stuff.\n\n613\n00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:18.510\nIt's like, I didn't go looking for it.\n\n614\n00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:19.230\nI didn't know it was there.\n\n615\n00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:23.940\nAnd I'm just like, this was here the whole\ntime that I was working in 2013?\n\n616\n00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:27.280\nThis could've done so much for me.\n\n617\n00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.870\nSo, I mean,\nit happens to all of us, everybody.\n\n618\n00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:33.320\nSo don't feel like,\nhow did I not know this?\n\n619\n00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:37.430\nI do it too, and\nif I can do it you can do it too.\n\n620\n00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:40.060\n&gt;&gt; Well Vonne it is definitely\na very powerful and\n\n621\n00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:45.160\ntime saving feature found here in Excel\n2016 and apparently as well as 2013.\n\n622\n00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:48.080\nSo we have that and\nyou can still do it there as well.\n\n623\n00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:52.180\nVery cool stuff if you've never seen this\nbefore, I've never seen this before.\n\n624\n00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:54.950\nAs I start to work more with Excel I\nknow that's gonna be a great time\n\n625\n00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:57.240\nsaving feature and\nthat's what it's all about.\n\n626\n00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.820\nMaking things efficient,\nmaking it easy for us\n\n627\n00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:04.820\ninstead of having to do a lot of this and\na lot of this and this, forget that noise.\n\n628\n00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:09.565\nJust copy paste and do my flash\nfill awesome right, minds blown.\n\n629\n00:29:09.565 --> 00:29:12.110\nVonne thanks so much for\ndropping by and teaching us,\n\n630\n00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:15.890\nthis is definitely going into my\nbookmarked favorites that's for sure.\n\n631\n00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:18.600\nI want to be aware of this\nas hard core as I can.\n\n632\n00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:19.870\nHopefully you do as well.\n\n633\n00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:21.910\nUnfortunately though we are at\nthe end of our episode.\n\n634\n00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:25.740\nWe do thank you for watching and we will\nbe back for more in our Excel series.\n\n635\n00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:28.070\nBut as for this one, we're gonna go\nahead and sign off for Office ProTV.\n\n636\n00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:29.920\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n637\n00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:30.840\n&gt;&gt;

to another\ngreat episode of OfficeProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.107 --> 00:00:11.570\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.815\nAnd today's episode, we are continuing on,\njust like we were before and\n\n6\n00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:20.330\nlike we will after,\nwith our Excel 2016 essentials series.\n\n7\n00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.420\nI say that because it has been\na wonderful thing so far.\n\n8\n00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.371\nAnd joining us who has given us many\nnuggets of great knowledge when it comes\n\n9\n00:00:27.371 --> 00:00:31.151\nto Excel, Miss Vonne Smith, Vonne,\nwelcome back, glad to have you.\n\n10\n00:00:31.151 --> 00:00:35.655\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, always glad to be here\n&gt;&gt; Always glad to have, have been had?\n\n11\n00:00:35.655 --> 00:00:36.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n12\n00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.850\nYou've been hanging\naround me too much again\n\n13\n00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.723\n&gt;&gt; I'm starting to,\n\n14\n00:00:39.723 --> 00:00:41.530\nit's like we're sharing a brain now.\n\n15\n00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.065\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n16\n00:00:42.065 --> 00:00:42.887\n&gt;&gt; It's getting scary, folks.\n\n17\n00:00:42.887 --> 00:00:43.444\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n18\n00:00:43.444 --> 00:00:46.958\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But we're gonna talk about something\n\n19\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:51.582\nthat's a little less scary, or\nhopefully make it less scary for you, and\n\n20\n00:00:51.582 --> 00:00:56.820\nthat is exporting your information from\nExcel, possibly even then, importing.\n\n21\n00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.030\nWe're not really gonna import honestly,\nbecause I should clarify that.\n\n22\n00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.310\nWe're not doing import text, because\nthere is an actual import function But\n\n23\n00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:04.530\nthat's a different episode.\n\n24\n00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.560\nBut what I'm trying to get at is, hey,\n\n25\n00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.050\nI have this file format that I want to\nopen in Excel and will Excel open it?\n\n26\n00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.040\nWell, if it's a CSE file, yes it will.\n\n27\n00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.946\nSo [LAUGH].\n\n28\n00:01:14.946 --> 00:01:16.736\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna talk about some\n\n29\n00:01:16.736 --> 00:01:20.093\nfile formats along the way here so\n&gt;&gt; When we're working in a cell, we're\n\n30\n00:01:20.093 --> 00:01:23.850\nworking within an XLSX file for, I try to\nvery enunciate that because it's really\n\n31\n00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.359\nhard to kinda blend all of those letters\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n32\n00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:30.608\nwhat is it, xray, lima, sierra, xray.\n\n33\n00:01:30.608 --> 00:01:31.775\n&gt;&gt; Sure, [LAUGH].\n\n34\n00:01:31.775 --> 00:01:36.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the phonetic alphabet for\nyou military types out there.\n\n35\n00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.620\n&gt;&gt; You know I will definitely\n\n36\n00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.448\ndefer to your judgement there\nbecause it sounds right to me.\n\n37\n00:01:41.448 --> 00:01:43.875\nSo, [LAUGH] but you could be saying it\nall wrong but it quite sounds great.\n\n38\n00:01:43.875 --> 00:01:45.257\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I tend to do that.\n\n39\n00:01:45.257 --> 00:01:46.093\n&gt;&gt; Xylophone.\n\n40\n00:01:46.093 --> 00:01:47.661\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n41\n00:01:47.661 --> 00:01:50.773\nI think x-ray works, [LAUGH].\n\n42\n00:01:50.773 --> 00:01:51.972\nI know.\n\n43\n00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.580\nAnd then Christmas Cats example.\n\n44\n00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.670\nI have a file here.\n\n45\n00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.920\nWe have and\nXLSX file format because that is the file\n\n46\n00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.840\nformat of Excel just like DOCX is Word and\nPPTX is PowerPoint.\n\n47\n00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.250\nWe have the X on the end of everything\nbecause that's where they brought\n\n48\n00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.470\neverything back into the XML archetypes\nto make it bigger and better.\n\n49\n00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.337\n&gt;&gt; And just to further clarify,\nin all seriousness,\n\n50\n00:02:20.337 --> 00:02:25.326\nthe XLSX file type we use\nis like my workbook.xlxs.\n\n51\n00:02:25.326 --> 00:02:26.620\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's XLSX,\n\n52\n00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.615\nthat's hard to say ladies and gents.\n\n53\n00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:29.404\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n54\n00:02:29.404 --> 00:02:31.868\n&gt;&gt; Really difficult,\nthey should've gone with somebody else.\n\n55\n00:02:31.868 --> 00:02:34.142\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It was easy when it was just XLS.\n\n56\n00:02:34.142 --> 00:02:37.208\nNow, XLS, X.\n\n57\n00:02:37.208 --> 00:02:40.296\n&gt;&gt; I know, yeah, they just keep expanding.\n\n58\n00:02:40.296 --> 00:02:41.713\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what's it gonna be next.\n\n59\n00:02:41.713 --> 00:02:42.641\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, right.\n\n60\n00:02:42.641 --> 00:02:46.989\nWhich is a good thing for us because it\nis expanded the capabilities of these\n\n61\n00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.310\nprograms, exponentially,\nto where they were before.\n\n62\n00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.240\nSo, it's a good thing to\nadd that extra letter on.\n\n63\n00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.818\nHard to say, but it's good for\nall of us [LAUGH].\n\n64\n00:02:57.818 --> 00:02:58.572\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n65\n00:02:58.572 --> 00:03:03.540\n&gt;&gt; But when we have this, okay,\nExcel opens this and that's fine.\n\n66\n00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.320\nBut what if I need to bring this or\nsends this out to somebody?\n\n67\n00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.380\nI'm actually gonna go over here to our\naddresses instead of our weekly sales,\n\n68\n00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.370\njust for fun.\n\n69\n00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.880\nSo there is a, so I'm using Excel,\nbut maybe I'm having somebody work in\n\n70\n00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.860\na proprietary software that\nis in some weird file format.\n\n71\n00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.470\nBut it all works with\nthe same type of data.\n\n72\n00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.220\nWhat I'm trying to get into is, how am\nI gonna transfer this over to somebody?\n\n73\n00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.200\nHow do I export this out?\n\n74\n00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.370\nFor other people to be able to\nuse in whatever form or format.\n\n75\n00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.110\nOkay, CSV.\n\n76\n00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.005\nCSV, do you know what that stands for\nthere, Daniel?\n\n77\n00:03:42.005 --> 00:03:43.830\n&gt;&gt; Comma separated value.\n\n78\n00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.090\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yes.\n\n79\n00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.480\nIt is a comma delimited file.\n\n80\n00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.080\nA delimiter is just a fancy word for\nseparator.\n\n81\n00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.481\nSo, we're saying that we would\nlike to take this information and\n\n82\n00:03:55.481 --> 00:04:00.860\nput it into a more generic file format\nof that CSV, that Comma Separated Value.\n\n83\n00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.700\nAnd this is something you'll see.\n\n84\n00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.010\nIt's very universal, okay?\n\n85\n00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.960\nA lot of your programs,\nmaybe you have some type of CRM,\n\n86\n00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.120\nor Customer Relations Management\ntype software.\n\n87\n00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.635\nMaybe you're using a mail program,\nlike MailChimp, or Salesforce.\n\n88\n00:04:21.635 --> 00:04:24.537\nYou know, there's a whole bunch of\ndifferent flavors out there that do all of\n\n89\n00:04:24.537 --> 00:04:25.860\nthese different things.\n\n90\n00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.123\nWell, it's storing that information, but\n\n91\n00:04:28.123 --> 00:04:32.051\nI need to be able to bring this down into\nExcel and do some funky stuff with it, or\n\n92\n00:04:32.051 --> 00:04:35.165\ntake my Excel information and\nput it on up into their program.\n\n93\n00:04:35.165 --> 00:04:41.400\nCSV is a very common\ntranslator if you wanna say.\n\n94\n00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.350\nSo it, basically,\njust takes into plain text, its not Excel,\n\n95\n00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.325\nits not like wrapped in Excel or wrapped\nin Access or whatever other programs.\n\n96\n00:04:50.325 --> 00:04:54.060\nIt's just the values separated by commas.\n\n97\n00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.400\n&gt;&gt; Like you say it's very,\nvery common, not comma.\n\n98\n00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.920\nThe CSVs are very common that\na lot of different programs\n\n99\n00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.670\nwill generate a CSV type of file.\n\n100\n00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:09.290\n&gt;&gt; Well even in Outlook, okay,I actually\nhave one here, let me back up here.\n\n101\n00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.920\nSo I have this and notice,\nlook at the icon on this, it's green and\n\n102\n00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:20.140\nit's got an x on it but it has\nan a there because that CSV file format\n\n103\n00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:25.120\nis recognized by Excel as,\nhey, I can read that.\n\n104\n00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.840\nI can understand that cuz anyone\n&gt;&gt; And it's in Microsoft,\n\n105\n00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.600\nobviously you're running Windows, you\nmight be running Windows, most people are.\n\n106\n00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.660\nIt's gonna say, that's the program I\nwant to associate with CSV type files\n\n107\n00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:38.860\nbecause it does such a good job.\n\n108\n00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.980\n&gt;&gt; Isn't it called a MIME type,\nlike an MIME?\n\n109\n00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.080\n&gt;&gt; It might be.\n\n110\n00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.855\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or, it's basically\nwhatever the file extension.\n\n111\n00:05:45.855 --> 00:05:47.239\n&gt;&gt; The format of the file.\n\n112\n00:05:47.239 --> 00:05:51.320\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and sometimes you have to,\nI know with like PDFs.\n\n113\n00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.000\nI have Acrobat on it but\n\n114\n00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.710\nit's like a default where it wants\nto open up in the browser cuz\n\n115\n00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.730\nEdge is the default program to\nview a PDF or something like that.\n\n116\n00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:07.165\nSo you have to go into your Windows\nsettings and say, no, no, no.\n\n117\n00:06:07.165 --> 00:06:12.030\nPDFs, when you see that file associated\nwith this particular program and\n\n118\n00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:16.460\nalways open it with Acrobat and\nthat's just really quickly to show you.\n\n119\n00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.080\nIf I right-click on this,\nthere is an Open with and\n\n120\n00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.600\nthen you can see that\nExcel is the primary.\n\n121\n00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.573\nBut if it's like a program or\n\n122\n00:06:24.573 --> 00:06:30.167\nfile that you keep opening that goes to\na different program, you can switch it and\n\n123\n00:06:30.167 --> 00:06:35.530\ntell it to choose a different application\nto go ahead and attach itself with.\n\n124\n00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.880\nSo CSVs are associated with Excel.\n\n125\n00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:45.220\nAnd what that means is everywhere\nthere is a separating or\n\n126\n00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.450\nColumn, think about there's gonna\nbe Alice and then a comma, and\n\n127\n00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:53.890\nthen Wonderpaws comma,\nand then department.\n\n128\n00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:57.790\nSo every time there's\na column there is a comma.\n\n129\n00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.230\nEverywhere there's a row,\nthere is an enter mark.\n\n130\n00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.860\nAnd you know what we could do,\nwe could do this, we could go ahead and\n\n131\n00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.980\nopen this with Notepad.\n\n132\n00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:08.570\nSo you can see this.\n\n133\n00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:13.950\nThere's all of the different commas that\nare going to be storing our information.\n\n134\n00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:16.330\nAnd then it will open up in Excel,\nall right.\n\n135\n00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:20.080\nSo lots of explanations on\nwhat this file format is.\n\n136\n00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.280\nBut we like to make sure that\nyou fully understand this.\n\n137\n00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.770\nI need to make this into a CSV file.\n\n138\n00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:27.374\nSo where do I go?\n\n139\n00:07:27.374 --> 00:07:31.860\nI go to File and I can go to Save as.\n\n140\n00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.800\nAnd then just change out the type.\n\n141\n00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.480\nI do not wanna save this\nas an Excel workbook.\n\n142\n00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.616\nDrop this down.\n\n143\n00:07:37.616 --> 00:07:40.065\nI wanna save it as a CSV.\n\n144\n00:07:40.065 --> 00:07:45.720\nNow, I'm going to point out that there\nare some other options down in here.\n\n145\n00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.828\nSo, you can see I have\nCSV Comma Delimited but\n\n146\n00:07:49.828 --> 00:07:55.571\nthen up at the top there's\na CSV UTF-8 Comma Delimited file.\n\n147\n00:07:55.571 --> 00:07:58.753\nNow, let's gets in to\nthe wonderful world of encoding,\n\n148\n00:07:58.753 --> 00:08:00.424\nwhich I do love to talk about.\n\n149\n00:08:00.424 --> 00:08:02.752\nSo, what is UTF-8?\n\n150\n00:08:02.752 --> 00:08:04.532\nI forgot.\n\n151\n00:08:04.532 --> 00:08:08.559\nUniversal Type Format, my gosh,\nI forgot what they actually means.\n\n152\n00:08:08.559 --> 00:08:10.557\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We have what's called the Internet.\n\n153\n00:08:10.557 --> 00:08:11.440\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes good.\n\n154\n00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.565\nWell, in a nutshell we have UTF-8,\nwe also have what's known as ANSI.\n\n155\n00:08:15.565 --> 00:08:20.414\nA-N-S, yeah, S-I.\n\n156\n00:08:20.414 --> 00:08:23.140\n[LAUGH] I have to do that,\nsometimes I switch my S's and my C's.\n\n157\n00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:28.691\nSo there are different ways of\nhow our character sets work.\n\n158\n00:08:28.691 --> 00:08:33.332\nWhen we're talking about character sets,\nwe're talking about like A B C D E,\n\n159\n00:08:33.332 --> 00:08:37.499\nthen there's the e with the tilde,\nor the o with the umlauts, right?\n\n160\n00:08:37.499 --> 00:08:39.161\nWhen you're getting into\nthose types of things,\n\n161\n00:08:39.161 --> 00:08:41.149\nyou're getting into what is\nknown as special characters.\n\n162\n00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:47.010\nAnd things that your computer can\nsupport only if it knows hey,\n\n163\n00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:48.500\nthat's what we're talking about.\n\n164\n00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.890\nIt's like languages.\n\n165\n00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:53.135\n&gt;&gt; Yes, Unicode Transformation Formats.\n\n166\n00:08:53.135 --> 00:08:53.848\n&gt;&gt; Wow, I was really far off.\n\n167\n00:08:53.848 --> 00:08:54.662\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n168\n00:08:54.662 --> 00:08:55.191\n&gt;&gt; Way off base.\n\n169\n00:08:55.191 --> 00:08:55.930\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n170\n00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:58.570\nI know it talks about\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n171\n00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:03.367\n&gt;&gt; How, where, what,\nbasically like what pond we're living in.\n\n172\n00:09:03.367 --> 00:09:07.815\nANSI, as a pond, that can only\nsupport this amount of characters.\n\n173\n00:09:07.815 --> 00:09:11.260\nUTF-8 is a bigger pond that\nsupports a lot more characters.\n\n174\n00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:17.360\nSo if you have information that has names\nwith tildes or names with umlauts or\n\n175\n00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:22.360\nany type of different language\nbesides just our regular english,\n\n176\n00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:26.180\nthat could be a big difference or\nbig problem for you.\n\n177\n00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:31.280\nIf you just sent it out as a csv,\nit's gonna remove all that because CSV\n\n178\n00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:36.640\nby default is encoded in that ANSI\ncharacter set and not in the UTF-8.\n\n179\n00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:40.572\nIt's funny, if you start searching for\nthis on the Oracle and the Internet,\n\n180\n00:09:40.572 --> 00:09:44.703\nthere's all sorts of stuff that were,\nwhy I'm having all these problems.\n\n181\n00:09:44.703 --> 00:09:50.495\nBecause I can't do that translation\nbetween Excel to wherever I'm going,\n\n182\n00:09:50.495 --> 00:09:53.851\nor vice versa cuz it doesn't support that.\n\n183\n00:09:53.851 --> 00:09:55.102\nI can't get it to do that.\n\n184\n00:09:55.102 --> 00:09:59.091\nSo that's why, in this version,\nit might have been in 2013.\n\n185\n00:09:59.091 --> 00:10:00.818\nHonestly, I don't really remember.\n\n186\n00:10:00.818 --> 00:10:01.589\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n187\n00:10:01.589 --> 00:10:04.196\n&gt;&gt; But,\ncuz I didn't have to think about this.\n\n188\n00:10:04.196 --> 00:10:08.180\nBut with CSV, UTF-8, it's gonna\nautomatically give you that bigger\n\n189\n00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:11.330\ncharacter set to support\nthe special characters.\n\n190\n00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:15.830\nAnd you can see the dates on those\nformat are forum boards where it's\n\n191\n00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:19.430\nlike back in 2007 or 3,\nlike this is a huge problem.\n\n192\n00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:22.123\nWhy can't you do this, Excel?\n\n193\n00:10:22.123 --> 00:10:23.990\nSo, pretty good stuff.\n\n194\n00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:26.950\nSo were gonna choose\nthe UTF-8 CSV file format.\n\n195\n00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:28.260\nWe will put it on our Desktop.\n\n196\n00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:28.830\nThat's great.\n\n197\n00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:29.980\nWe click Save.\n\n198\n00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:35.010\nNow, I do wanna to point out, the CSV file\nformat does have some limitations, and\n\n199\n00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:41.690\nit is saying right here,\nthat it does not support multiple sheets.\n\n200\n00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:46.550\nSo if I was trying to do every sheet in\nthis workbook, it's not gonna happen.\n\n201\n00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:50.880\nYou have to do it one by one, because\nthat's just the way the file format is,\n\n202\n00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:51.971\nwhat it supports.\n\n203\n00:10:51.971 --> 00:10:53.991\nSo are you sure you only want\nto save the active sheet?\n\n204\n00:10:53.991 --> 00:10:57.710\nThen, click OK, if not, then you're\ngonna have to cancel and redo it.\n\n205\n00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:59.226\nI click OK, and then there you go.\n\n206\n00:10:59.226 --> 00:11:03.551\nBut notice that, I am gonna get this\nwarning across the top that says, hey,\n\n207\n00:11:03.551 --> 00:11:06.400\nsome features might be\nlost when you're saving.\n\n208\n00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.352\nOkay, that's fine.\n\n209\n00:11:07.352 --> 00:11:09.730\nThank you so much,\nI'm just gonna x this out.\n\n210\n00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:13.530\nAnd right now, it's like well, look,\nI have all three of my workbooks or\n\n211\n00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:15.750\nmy worksheets, so what's going on here?\n\n212\n00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:19.830\nYes, you are in the CSV file\nbecause you did a File Save as.\n\n213\n00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:24.210\nBut, to make sure you know where\nyou are at, close the file.\n\n214\n00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:27.402\nAnd then if you open it back up,\nhere's that CSV.\n\n215\n00:11:27.402 --> 00:11:32.895\nNotice that when I open it, it is only\nthe one worksheet and it took out\n\n216\n00:11:32.895 --> 00:11:39.820\nall of the formatting cuz CSV files don't\nsupport all of the fonts and the colors.\n\n217\n00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:43.910\nBut it will go ahead and\ndisplay what it looks likes in Excel but\n\n218\n00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:45.290\nit's still a CSV file.\n\n219\n00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:48.230\nSo now you know that Excel can open it.\n\n220\n00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.680\nBut, if you're doing this, you're saying,\n\n221\n00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.220\nyou're bringing this\ninformation from another place.\n\n222\n00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:55.920\nYou should always then, immediately,\n\n223\n00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:01.190\nor soon as possible,\nsave it into a XLS file format.\n\n224\n00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:04.670\nAnd then you can have all the full\ncapabilities of what Excel can do.\n\n225\n00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:08.013\nBecause you might be able to do\ncertain things within this CSV file.\n\n226\n00:12:08.013 --> 00:12:10.880\nWhen you save, it's gonna remove\nall that formatting anyways.\n\n227\n00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.698\nSo just keep that in mind,\nwhen opening CSV,\n\n228\n00:12:14.698 --> 00:12:20.031\ngo right into a Save as XLSX, and\nthen you'll be able to use it.\n\n229\n00:12:20.031 --> 00:12:23.960\nCool, So, fun stuff with CSV file formats.\n\n230\n00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.570\nVery simple, really easy,\njust File Save As.\n\n231\n00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:30.250\nBut you need to know what's\nall the back story from it.\n\n232\n00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:35.765\nBut now, there's some other file types\nthat you can export your file into,\n\n233\n00:12:35.765 --> 00:12:39.482\nwhich we'll explore those\nwith our cats example.\n\n234\n00:12:39.482 --> 00:12:40.323\nThere it is.\n\n235\n00:12:40.323 --> 00:12:41.432\nLet's open this file.\n\n236\n00:12:41.432 --> 00:12:43.260\nThis is our Excel file now.\n\n237\n00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:48.200\nThere's a file format known as ODS and\n\n238\n00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.770\nlet's get to it first by going\nover to the file export.\n\n239\n00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:54.395\nAnd of course, you're gonna export\nit as a PDF if you wanted to,\n\n240\n00:12:54.395 --> 00:12:57.950\ncuz I don't want people to be\nable to make changes to the PDF.\n\n241\n00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:00.172\nUnless you're like me and\nknow all the tricks about Acrobat,\n\n242\n00:13:00.172 --> 00:13:02.020\nthen I can pretty much get\nanything I want out of it.\n\n243\n00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:05.560\nUnless just, put some security on it,\nthen you're-\n\n244\n00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.610\n&gt;&gt; Gets a little iffy.\n\n245\n00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:07.810\n&gt;&gt; And\nyou're making it a little harder for me.\n\n246\n00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:10.611\nBut [LAUGH] that's when I just talk to\nyou and talk about breaking passwords.\n\n247\n00:13:10.611 --> 00:13:14.198\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I have and can do that.\n\n248\n00:13:14.198 --> 00:13:15.497\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right now, don't get scared.\n\n249\n00:13:15.497 --> 00:13:17.684\n[LAUGH] Just what happens.\n\n250\n00:13:17.684 --> 00:13:21.860\n[LAUGH] So we have Change File Type.\n\n251\n00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:23.710\nAnd you see that these are other ones.\n\n252\n00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:28.435\nAnd an Open document spreadsheet, this is\nwhere, have you ever heard of, what is it,\n\n253\n00:13:28.435 --> 00:13:29.297\nOffice Libre?\n\n254\n00:13:29.297 --> 00:13:30.021\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n255\n00:13:30.021 --> 00:13:31.360\nYes, I've used it, actually, yes.\n\n256\n00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:36.446\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay, that is an,\nif you're like I don't know what that is,\n\n257\n00:13:36.446 --> 00:13:39.430\nit is an Open source program basically,\n\n258\n00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:44.480\nthat Open-source as opposed to\npropriety like Microsoft Excel.\n\n259\n00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.080\nYou have to purchase this product.\n\n260\n00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.900\nOpen Office is that Open-source\nwhere you don't have to buy it.\n\n261\n00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:52.520\n&gt;&gt; And\nyou don't even purchase the product.\n\n262\n00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:56.820\nSo with Proprietary software,\nyou don't purchase the software,\n\n263\n00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.610\nyou purchase the right\nto use the software.\n\n264\n00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:03.630\nThey still don't give you what\nmakes the software the software and\n\n265\n00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:05.760\nget to see the secrets behinds the scenes,\n\n266\n00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.160\nwhere an Open-source software\nwould actually do that.\n\n267\n00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.360\nThey say, here is the underlining code\nthat developed this product and hey,\n\n268\n00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.750\nmaybe if you're a developer you can find\nsome problems with them and fix them or\n\n269\n00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:20.050\nyou thought of the really cool add on that\ncould go into it, add it in there, and\n\n270\n00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:22.100\nthen, we'll repackage it and\nresend it out.\n\n271\n00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.550\nSo, it's just two different types\nof philosophies when it comes to\n\n272\n00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:29.930\nsoftware development and\nI tend to like Open- source.\n\n273\n00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:35.050\nThe pay for models, the proprietary models\ntend to be very much more featureful and\n\n274\n00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:36.975\nhave a lot more power usually.\n\n275\n00:14:36.975 --> 00:14:38.820\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Not always but usually.\n\n276\n00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:42.869\nYeah, I actually forgot about\nthat whole aspect of Open-source,\n\n277\n00:14:42.869 --> 00:14:46.932\nit's almost like Crowdsourcing if\nanybody is familiar with that.\n\n278\n00:14:46.932 --> 00:14:50.790\nIt's not one proprietary people, or-\n&gt;&gt; A community.\n\n279\n00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:53.922\n&gt;&gt; Yes, the community and\nwe all work together for\n\n280\n00:14:53.922 --> 00:14:58.395\nthat common purpose and so\neverything is completely transparent.\n\n281\n00:14:58.395 --> 00:14:59.030\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n282\n00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:00.210\n&gt;&gt; Yes, very good point.\n\n283\n00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:03.500\nSo if you were moving\nover into Office Libre or\n\n284\n00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:08.792\nI believe some version of Google docs,\nkind of works this way, as well.\n\n285\n00:15:08.792 --> 00:15:12.590\nI'm not saying,\nthat they save it into an ODS file format.\n\n286\n00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.910\nBut if you were going into those other\nways you might need to go ahead and\n\n287\n00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:18.800\nexport this out into this\nparticular file format\n\n288\n00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:23.731\nto be able to talk to the other\nOpen-source programs.\n\n289\n00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.260\nWe have a couple of other ones,\n\n290\n00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:30.880\nwe'll be talking about Marcos in our\nExcel Advance and how that works.\n\n291\n00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:36.130\nA macro is just a recorded steps\nwithin your file that you need to make\n\n292\n00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:41.560\nsure you save it in a file format that\nwill allow for those macros to be run.\n\n293\n00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:44.510\nMacros of course, takes it in a different\nlevel because then you're starting getting\n\n294\n00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.060\ninto coding that could\npotentially be malicious.\n\n295\n00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:51.666\nSo be very careful about opening up files\nthat have macros that you don't know who\n\n296\n00:15:51.666 --> 00:15:52.624\nthey came from.\n\n297\n00:15:52.624 --> 00:15:54.279\nYou might just wanna say no.\n\n298\n00:15:54.279 --> 00:15:56.988\nAnytime we talk about macros,\neverybody in the office is like,\n\n299\n00:15:56.988 --> 00:15:59.211\nthe answer is turn them off\njust don't accept them.\n\n300\n00:15:59.211 --> 00:16:01.795\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're bad, they're real bad.\n\n301\n00:16:01.795 --> 00:16:03.582\nCuz they just open you up to.\n\n302\n00:16:03.582 --> 00:16:05.599\nViruses and things and malware.\n\n303\n00:16:05.599 --> 00:16:07.758\n&gt;&gt; But we will be using for good.\n\n304\n00:16:07.758 --> 00:16:10.133\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] In our episodes,\n\n305\n00:16:10.133 --> 00:16:11.406\ncuz they can be very handy.\n\n306\n00:16:11.406 --> 00:16:13.947\nBut it's more of like,\nyou create a macro for yourself.\n\n307\n00:16:13.947 --> 00:16:15.127\n&gt;&gt; It's a double edged sword,\nis what it is.\n\n308\n00:16:15.127 --> 00:16:20.784\nCuz macros are extremely handy, you just\nneed to be really careful about allowing,\n\n309\n00:16:20.784 --> 00:16:23.346\nwhen you get a file from someone else.\n\n310\n00:16:23.346 --> 00:16:27.457\nSomething you didn't create or from\nsomeone that you trust, that you know and\n\n311\n00:16:27.457 --> 00:16:29.000\nyou trust them.\n\n312\n00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.410\nMake sure, and even if you do trust them\ndo you trust the person they got it from.\n\n313\n00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:37.426\nSo you're gonna be really careful with\nmacros this is just our security,\n\n314\n00:16:37.426 --> 00:16:40.031\ndon't forget to wear\na seat belt kind of thing.\n\n315\n00:16:40.031 --> 00:16:42.275\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So just make sure, verify and\n\n316\n00:16:42.275 --> 00:16:45.321\nthat you trust the files if\nyou're gonna allow macros.\n\n317\n00:16:45.321 --> 00:16:46.290\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yes, and\n\n318\n00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:49.540\nwe actually have a whole series on\nthat in our security section too.\n\n319\n00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:51.225\nSo check out our [INAUDIBLE].\n\n320\n00:16:51.225 --> 00:16:55.209\nThere's some other file format\nthat in here, we have a TXT file.\n\n321\n00:16:55.209 --> 00:16:59.983\nSo we talked about CSV which is a\ncomma-separated values or comma delimiter.\n\n322\n00:16:59.983 --> 00:17:04.657\nThen you also tab delimited files and\nthat's usually a TXT file\n\n323\n00:17:04.657 --> 00:17:07.890\nformat not a CSV, cuz then it's not-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n324\n00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:08.517\n&gt;&gt; Commas anymore.\n\n325\n00:17:08.517 --> 00:17:12.254\n[LAUGH] And that's what it's\nseparated by tabs instead of a comma.\n\n326\n00:17:12.254 --> 00:17:17.780\nIt depends on what program or software\nyou're trying to get this information\n\n327\n00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:24.160\ninto where they might want to prefer tabs\nversus commas, but either one is in there.\n\n328\n00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.136\nSo those are some file types\nthat we have in our Export.\n\n329\n00:17:26.136 --> 00:17:29.901\nAnd like I said you always have\ncreating a PDF, to where you want that.\n\n330\n00:17:29.901 --> 00:17:34.345\nThat's another very universal file type\nto where I can't send you the Excel\n\n331\n00:17:34.345 --> 00:17:36.506\ndocument cuz you don't have Excel.\n\n332\n00:17:36.506 --> 00:17:40.572\nBut I still wanna send you like\na proof of it, send in a PDF.\n\n333\n00:17:40.572 --> 00:17:43.038\nPDF's can be ready anywhere pretty much.\n\n334\n00:17:43.038 --> 00:17:47.412\nEven we talked about our browsers opening\nup PDFs and being able to see it and so\n\n335\n00:17:47.412 --> 00:17:48.910\non and so forth.\n\n336\n00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:50.380\nSo that's our Export options.\n\n337\n00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:54.781\nBut there's a couple other I just wanna\nkinda touch on that you can get through\n\n338\n00:17:54.781 --> 00:17:56.281\nthe file Save As command.\n\n339\n00:17:56.281 --> 00:17:59.564\nWe talked about this when\nwe were doing our CSV file.\n\n340\n00:17:59.564 --> 00:18:02.144\nWhich you can see,\nyou could also go to the Exports, so\n\n341\n00:18:02.144 --> 00:18:04.066\na lot of these are like in the same place.\n\n342\n00:18:04.066 --> 00:18:06.576\nBut if you drop this down here, and\n\n343\n00:18:06.576 --> 00:18:11.869\nthere's a couple other options in here,\nyou can save it as an HTML page.\n\n344\n00:18:11.869 --> 00:18:19.560\nOr you can also save it as what is known\nas a single file webpage which is a MTHL.\n\n345\n00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:24.537\nNowadays with where you have your\nOfice365, you have your OneDrive and\n\n346\n00:18:24.537 --> 00:18:28.961\nwhere you could just share a link\nto your files like having to create\n\n347\n00:18:28.961 --> 00:18:30.542\na standalone web page.\n\n348\n00:18:30.542 --> 00:18:33.833\nI'm not sure if you really\nneed it anymore, but\n\n349\n00:18:33.833 --> 00:18:37.633\nI just wanna to at least touch\non it that you could do it.\n\n350\n00:18:37.633 --> 00:18:42.217\nNow what's the difference\nbetween MHTML and a HTML file?\n\n351\n00:18:42.217 --> 00:18:46.769\n[LAUGH] I would just say M is for\nMicrosoft that makes it special and\n\n352\n00:18:46.769 --> 00:18:52.345\nreally kind of, it's a special version\nof HTML that only Microsoft talks in.\n\n353\n00:18:52.345 --> 00:18:53.739\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; When you say special.\n\n354\n00:18:53.739 --> 00:18:56.484\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It throws in a bunch, I mean for\n\n355\n00:18:56.484 --> 00:18:58.233\nsomebody who knows-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n356\n00:18:58.233 --> 00:19:00.773\n&gt;&gt; Code and everything and knows HTML,\nyou're just like what is that tag?\n\n357\n00:19:00.773 --> 00:19:03.019\nLike they just make up\ntheir own tags basically.\n\n358\n00:19:03.019 --> 00:19:06.518\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, it's par for the course when\nit comes to Microsoft, I mean the whole,\n\n359\n00:19:06.518 --> 00:19:08.421\nyou guys probably won't understand this.\n\n360\n00:19:08.421 --> 00:19:14.597\nBut the NetBIOS stuff, it was DNS,\nthis is their own version of DNS.\n\n361\n00:19:14.597 --> 00:19:16.535\nThey're like we're just gonna do our own.\n\n362\n00:19:16.535 --> 00:19:21.011\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I actually kind of know\nwhat those letters mean, but\n\n363\n00:19:21.011 --> 00:19:22.386\nit is for-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n364\n00:19:22.386 --> 00:19:23.159\n&gt;&gt; The whole hand wave type thing.\n\n365\n00:19:23.159 --> 00:19:23.711\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n366\n00:19:23.711 --> 00:19:25.382\n&gt;&gt; It's just Microsoft being Microsoft.\n\n367\n00:19:25.382 --> 00:19:29.287\nAnd they're like it's a special version of\na standard that we're gonna go ahead and\n\n368\n00:19:29.287 --> 00:19:29.952\nmake our own.\n\n369\n00:19:29.952 --> 00:19:31.495\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's how they roll.\n\n370\n00:19:31.495 --> 00:19:32.058\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they do.\n\n371\n00:19:32.058 --> 00:19:34.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which isn't a bad thing,\n\n372\n00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.021\nbecause it makes it where\nthat all talks to each other.\n\n373\n00:19:37.021 --> 00:19:40.557\nAnd we can all be able to live\nin our Microsoft world that once\n\n374\n00:19:40.557 --> 00:19:44.465\nyou're in your Microsoft world\nyou're in the Microsoft world.\n\n375\n00:19:44.465 --> 00:19:45.103\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n376\n00:19:45.103 --> 00:19:47.277\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And you can't really-\n&gt;&gt; Get your floaties on.\n\n377\n00:19:47.277 --> 00:19:48.753\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n378\n00:19:48.753 --> 00:19:49.749\n&gt;&gt; You're swimming in their pool.\n\n379\n00:19:49.749 --> 00:19:50.970\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n380\n00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:53.208\nthey don't really wanna swim\nin anybody else's pool either.\n\n381\n00:19:53.208 --> 00:19:53.905\n&gt;&gt; No, they don't.\n\n382\n00:19:53.905 --> 00:19:57.686\n&gt;&gt; So that's where when you have people\nthat are, it's almost like Apple and\n\n383\n00:19:57.686 --> 00:20:01.647\nWindows users, it's like Apple people\nare like no, we're the best, no,\n\n384\n00:20:01.647 --> 00:20:02.568\nwe're the best.\n\n385\n00:20:02.568 --> 00:20:05.405\nIt's like but we do the same thing.\n\n386\n00:20:05.405 --> 00:20:05.952\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n387\n00:20:05.952 --> 00:20:06.912\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n388\n00:20:06.912 --> 00:20:07.485\n&gt;&gt; But just different.\n\n389\n00:20:07.485 --> 00:20:10.730\n&gt;&gt; Just differently.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's just how it works.\n\n390\n00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:12.023\nSo we have the different options here.\n\n391\n00:20:12.023 --> 00:20:14.496\nIf you wanted to save it as a web page,\nyou could.\n\n392\n00:20:14.496 --> 00:20:20.337\nI would probably say save it as an HTML,\nbut if you do want the functionality\n\n393\n00:20:20.337 --> 00:20:25.365\nof having all that Excel like in\nthe browser, save it as a MHTML.\n\n394\n00:20:25.365 --> 00:20:28.335\nBut then again,\njust put it up into your OneDrive accoun.\n\n395\n00:20:28.335 --> 00:20:32.566\nAnd then just share out the link and have\npeople to where they don't have to edit.\n\n396\n00:20:32.566 --> 00:20:36.019\nYhey just want to view only and then they\ncan view it in their web browser and\n\n397\n00:20:36.019 --> 00:20:37.083\neverything's fine.\n\n398\n00:20:37.083 --> 00:20:40.708\nSo, but\nI wanted to point that file format out.\n\n399\n00:20:40.708 --> 00:20:46.022\nThere is one in here that\nwhen you go to the Publish.\n\n400\n00:20:46.022 --> 00:20:47.834\nNow this is getting into a funny area.\n\n401\n00:20:47.834 --> 00:20:53.903\nThis is Publish with Power By and\nI had to go look this up I was,\n\n402\n00:20:53.903 --> 00:20:57.961\nlike what is this Publish with Power By.\n\n403\n00:20:57.961 --> 00:21:04.507\nAnd I do have some links in our show notes\nthat go to it and it's funny, because\n\n404\n00:21:04.507 --> 00:21:09.278\nit's basically like a business type of-\n&gt;&gt; It's Power BI.\n\n405\n00:21:09.278 --> 00:21:10.568\n&gt;&gt; It's Power BI.\n\n406\n00:21:10.568 --> 00:21:11.921\nIt's Power BI.\n\n407\n00:21:11.921 --> 00:21:12.678\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, probably Power BI.\n\n408\n00:21:12.678 --> 00:21:13.724\n&gt;&gt; Business intelligence.\n\n409\n00:21:13.724 --> 00:21:14.737\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n410\n00:21:14.737 --> 00:21:16.776\n&gt;&gt; There you go, okay.\n\n411\n00:21:16.776 --> 00:21:19.295\n[LAUGH] So that's where we can learn more.\n\n412\n00:21:19.295 --> 00:21:20.667\n&gt;&gt; Powered by the sea.\n\n413\n00:21:20.667 --> 00:21:23.152\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Perfect, so\n\n414\n00:21:23.152 --> 00:21:26.824\nyou can learn more about\nwhat it can do for\n\n415\n00:21:26.824 --> 00:21:31.577\nyou with this particular\nplatform in this service.\n\n416\n00:21:31.577 --> 00:21:36.993\nBut if you don't have a Publish,\nyes, Power BI subscription,\n\n417\n00:21:36.993 --> 00:21:42.328\nthen you're not gonna have this\neven in your publish options.\n\n418\n00:21:42.328 --> 00:21:45.241\nI'm pretty sure that in\nthe accounts that we have,\n\n419\n00:21:45.241 --> 00:21:50.145\nlike we have every single service that you\ncould ever think of that Microsoft offers.\n\n420\n00:21:50.145 --> 00:21:52.435\nSo that's why we have it, but\n\n421\n00:21:52.435 --> 00:21:57.600\nthere was one of them down here\nthat I thought was kind of funny.\n\n422\n00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.414\nI think it's talking about\nin the Getting Started.\n\n423\n00:21:59.414 --> 00:22:04.551\nIt's saying that it was retired,\nand that we're no\n\n424\n00:22:04.551 --> 00:22:09.708\nlonger going to be using Power BI for\nOffice 365.\n\n425\n00:22:09.708 --> 00:22:13.526\nA previous version now has been\ntransitioned into the current version of\n\n426\n00:22:13.526 --> 00:22:14.097\nPower BI.\n\n427\n00:22:14.097 --> 00:22:17.286\nIt's just Microsoft using the same\nword for the same product.\n\n428\n00:22:17.286 --> 00:22:19.356\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Like the OneDrive versus OneDrive.\n\n429\n00:22:19.356 --> 00:22:21.215\nAnd it's like, so yeah,\nso it's been retired.\n\n430\n00:22:21.215 --> 00:22:24.017\nI'm like, because I read that, I'm like\nwait, they're retiring this product?\n\n431\n00:22:24.017 --> 00:22:30.760\nNo, just the Office 365,\nand now it's just not 365.\n\n432\n00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.745\nIt's a little confusing, but\nif you do know anything about that.\n\n433\n00:22:33.745 --> 00:22:38.252\nAnd your company is using that particular\nservice, it is the Publish, it's not\n\n434\n00:22:38.252 --> 00:22:42.510\nin the Save As or the Export., so just\nwanted to throw that out there to you.\n\n435\n00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:47.593\nThe last one I would like to\njust touch on is the templates.\n\n436\n00:22:47.593 --> 00:22:52.016\nBecause it is in there as file Save As,\nwe do have some other places where\n\n437\n00:22:52.016 --> 00:22:56.535\nwe'll be talking about a template,\nbut templates are pretty awesome.\n\n438\n00:22:56.535 --> 00:22:59.160\nSo let me tell you what they do.\n\n439\n00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:04.059\nLet's say here, I am always going to be\ndoing weekly sales for my company, right?\n\n440\n00:23:04.059 --> 00:23:09.245\nAnd every week, I open up the previous\nweek and then I change at the data,\n\n441\n00:23:09.245 --> 00:23:13.000\ndo a file Save As and\nthen go ahead and name it my week.\n\n442\n00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:19.270\nBut I'm always having to cancel that\ninformation or replace it or delete it.\n\n443\n00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:23.775\nCool thing about a template is that you're\ngoing to be creating your own what I call\n\n444\n00:23:23.775 --> 00:23:24.306\na stamp.\n\n445\n00:23:24.306 --> 00:23:27.231\nAnd you take your stamp,\nyou stamp it on a piece of paper and\n\n446\n00:23:27.231 --> 00:23:29.280\nthen you fill in the parts that you want.\n\n447\n00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:33.704\nYou don't have to open up an existing\nfile and change all the data out.\n\n448\n00:23:33.704 --> 00:23:37.494\nAnd that's where I think the word and\nthe terminology of template gets kind of\n\n449\n00:23:37.494 --> 00:23:41.006\nmisconstrued, is that people say here,\nlet me give you a template.\n\n450\n00:23:41.006 --> 00:23:46.082\nAnd they just send me a regular Excel\nfile, like that's not a true template.\n\n451\n00:23:46.082 --> 00:23:49.218\nA true template is an XLTX and\n\n452\n00:23:49.218 --> 00:23:54.587\nthen it goes into when I\ndo a File &gt; New over here.\n\n453\n00:23:54.587 --> 00:23:58.731\nAnd we talked about this when we were\nsaying about just our Excel basics that I\n\n454\n00:23:58.731 --> 00:24:01.774\ncould create our loan\namortization that you wrote in C,\n\n455\n00:24:01.774 --> 00:24:02.588\nthat is-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n456\n00:24:02.588 --> 00:24:03.526\n&gt;&gt; Right here.\n\n457\n00:24:03.526 --> 00:24:04.821\nSo I could go ahead and take this.\n\n458\n00:24:04.821 --> 00:24:08.939\nBut I can go into my personal and\nI can have my own templates that I make.\n\n459\n00:24:08.939 --> 00:24:10.030\nIt's pretty awesome.\n\n460\n00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:11.870\nSo let me demonstrate.\n\n461\n00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:16.830\nThe thing that you need to do in your\nfirst xlsx file is to delete the content\n\n462\n00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:20.204\nout that you're always\ngoing to be changing out.\n\n463\n00:24:20.204 --> 00:24:23.040\nSo for this part,\nI'm going to select all these cells.\n\n464\n00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.710\nGo ahead and delete that.\n\n465\n00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:29.180\nNow, all those functions\nare connected to this data.\n\n466\n00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:33.740\nSo just know that that's what's going on\nhere and we have other shows on this.\n\n467\n00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:37.380\nSo I'm gonna clear out the parts\nthat I want to be blank.\n\n468\n00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:38.683\nThis is maybe the notes too.\n\n469\n00:24:38.683 --> 00:24:40.856\nLet's go ahead and\ndelete the content out of there.\n\n470\n00:24:40.856 --> 00:24:42.610\nI'm just hitting the delete key.\n\n471\n00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:45.260\nSo, I've cleared out all\nthe parts that I need.\n\n472\n00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:51.200\nNow, with the spaces open,\nyou're going to do a File &gt; Save As.\n\n473\n00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.230\nAnd you're gonna change the file type.\n\n474\n00:24:53.230 --> 00:25:00.100\nYou're gonna change this to a Template,\nwhich is right there.\n\n475\n00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:00.750\nNo, that's a 2003.\n\n476\n00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:02.000\nSo, there it is.\n\n477\n00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.669\nOkay, Excel template.\n\n478\n00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:06.890\nDo not change the location.\n\n479\n00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:09.248\nKeep it in that custom office templates.\n\n480\n00:25:09.248 --> 00:25:12.370\nYou click Save.\n\n481\n00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:14.340\nYou close the Excel.\n\n482\n00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:16.310\nKind of give it a nice restart.\n\n483\n00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:18.100\nYou do not open that file.\n\n484\n00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.170\nYou do not open the XLSX file.\n\n485\n00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:24.100\nYou start Excel up.\n\n486\n00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:27.660\nYou come into your New,\nyou go into the Personal.\n\n487\n00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.180\nAnd it's like, here's your little stamp.\n\n488\n00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:33.320\nYour gonna stamp it down on there,\nand boop I'm ready to go.\n\n489\n00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:37.050\nI can type in my numbers, and\nthen it's gonna do everything.\n\n490\n00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:41.060\nI do a regular File &gt; Save As,\nand then save as an Excel file.\n\n491\n00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:42.040\nNot a template.\n\n492\n00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:46.150\nIt's an xlsx file and\nthen go ahead and change it.\n\n493\n00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:48.602\nSo it makes it a lot easier.\n\n494\n00:25:48.602 --> 00:25:52.871\nIt's your starting point and you can\ncustomize it and make your own template so\n\n495\n00:25:52.871 --> 00:25:56.610\nyou don't have to go with the ones\nthat are built into Excel.\n\n496\n00:25:56.610 --> 00:26:01.210\nYou make your own, and now I'm ready\nto go with a new file every time, and\n\n497\n00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:03.910\nI don't have to change\nout all the information.\n\n498\n00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:04.670\nIt's pretty handy.\n\n499\n00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:07.640\n&gt;&gt; It is very handy to be able to create\nyour own templates so that you don't have\n\n500\n00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:11.490\nto keep reinventing the wheel every\ntime you wanna create a new workbook.\n\n501\n00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:12.820\nVery, very nice stuff, Vonne.\n\n502\n00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:16.260\nYou did a great job of teaching us all\nthe different file types that we can\n\n503\n00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:20.530\nassociate with when we use Excel,\nthat we might see common to Excel.\n\n504\n00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:23.810\nThe CSV files being\nextremely common to see.\n\n505\n00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:27.230\nObviously xlx, and xls,\n\n506\n00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:31.350\nsince they are native to Excel,\nand then the OD, what is it ODF?\n\n507\n00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:37.440\n&gt;&gt; We did ODS, and we also talked about\nsome txt files, and the HTML files.\n\n508\n00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:40.350\nBut again, we have Office 365,\nwhich is super handy, so.\n\n509\n00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:41.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's great stuff.\n\n510\n00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.200\nSo great stuff there,\nwe do appreciate that, and\n\n511\n00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.630\nwe appreciate you guys for watching.\n\n512\n00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:46.670\nBut that looks like it\nwraps up this episode.\n\n513\n00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:49.020\nWe do thank you again for\nwatching and joining us.\n\n514\n00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.990\nHopefully you guys\nare learning a lot from this.\n\n515\n00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:54.230\nIt’s our hope and\nour goal of every episode we do.\n\n516\n00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:56.330\nThat being said,\nwe're going to sign off for OFFICEPROTV.\n\n517\n00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:57.770\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n518\n00:26:57.770 --> 00:26:58.470\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n519\n00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:00.830\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n520\n00:27:00.830 -->

another exciting\nepisode of OfficePro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.018 --> 00:00:14.123\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode,\n\n5\n00:00:14.123 --> 00:00:18.050\nwe are continuing forth with more\nin our Excel 2016 Essentials.\n\n6\n00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.280\nIt's been a lot of fun so\nfar, and joining us back for\n\n7\n00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.433\nmore of that fun our good friend Ms.\nVonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:24.120\nVonne take it away, how's it going today?\n\n9\n00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.235\n&gt;&gt; It's great, we're gonna talk about-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Something.\n\n10\n00:00:28.235 --> 00:00:30.417\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was like we're talking\nabout modifying a worksheet.\n\n11\n00:00:30.417 --> 00:00:31.204\n&gt;&gt; Pop music.\n\n12\n00:00:31.204 --> 00:00:34.145\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We talk a lot about pop music off\n\n13\n00:00:34.145 --> 00:00:34.724\ncamera.\n\n14\n00:00:34.724 --> 00:00:37.453\nWe do a lot of singing,\na lot of dancing sometimes too.\n\n15\n00:00:37.453 --> 00:00:41.354\nWell, I usually dance,\nyou usually sing, but [LAUGH]\n\n16\n00:00:41.354 --> 00:00:42.217\n&gt;&gt; Anyway, Vonne.\n\n17\n00:00:42.217 --> 00:00:43.043\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n18\n00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:45.875\nwe're gonna be talking about\nchanging our column width,\n\n19\n00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:49.822\nwe're gonna talk about changing our row\nheight and some other things like that.\n\n20\n00:00:49.822 --> 00:00:51.341\nWe actually covered it a little bit,\n\n21\n00:00:51.341 --> 00:00:53.596\ncuz you actually pulled it\nout of me in one of episodes.\n\n22\n00:00:53.596 --> 00:00:55.948\nI was like I wasn't gonna go there,\nbut I'm so glad we did.\n\n23\n00:00:55.948 --> 00:00:57.488\n&gt;&gt; Well I was still kinda confused,\n\n24\n00:00:57.488 --> 00:01:00.739\nI didn't understand that what you\nhad done was what I was thinking so.\n\n25\n00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.654\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, and\nit naturally flowed into there.\n\n26\n00:01:03.654 --> 00:01:04.571\n&gt;&gt; It did, it worked out really well.\n\n27\n00:01:04.571 --> 00:01:08.201\n&gt;&gt; So if you watch that episode we're\ngonna talk a little bit more about it, but\n\n28\n00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:10.882\nin case you haven't watched\nit you should check it out.\n\n29\n00:01:10.882 --> 00:01:11.493\nIt was a lot of fun,\n\n30\n00:01:11.493 --> 00:01:13.265\nI think it was the Navigate a Workbook-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so.\n\n31\n00:01:13.265 --> 00:01:15.116\n&gt;&gt; Was the one we did, it was good times.\n\n32\n00:01:15.116 --> 00:01:16.778\n&gt;&gt; Primo, Primo work on our part.\n\n33\n00:01:16.778 --> 00:01:21.944\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So we're gonna have some more\nfun with it and talk about all of that.\n\n34\n00:01:21.944 --> 00:01:27.588\nSo let's jump down into a file I\nhave called Modify a Worksheet.\n\n35\n00:01:27.588 --> 00:01:29.289\nSo I have some information here,\n\n36\n00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:32.949\nit's the same stuff we've been seeing\nin our Christmas Cats example.\n\n37\n00:01:32.949 --> 00:01:36.697\nBut I just brought it in, I didn't have\nit formatted or anything to show you.\n\n38\n00:01:36.697 --> 00:01:41.050\nThat when I have some of our\ntext that is in a column\n\n39\n00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.626\nthat's next to a column\nthat has more text into it.\n\n40\n00:01:45.626 --> 00:01:49.142\nIt's not even truncating,\nit's really just cutting it off.\n\n41\n00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:51.303\nOkay, it is making it to\nwhere I don't see everything.\n\n42\n00:01:51.303 --> 00:01:55.611\nSo for example,\nin let's say our column E right here,\n\n43\n00:01:55.611 --> 00:02:01.529\nthis is our address line, but I'm not\nseeing all the information to here.\n\n44\n00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:07.033\nSo if I'm selected on cell E4 right now,\nyou can see it does say 1345\n\n45\n00:02:07.033 --> 00:02:12.009\nWest Fire Pause Lane, and\nI know that because in the formula bar.\n\n46\n00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:16.538\nBut I don't see all of that\nwithin this particular cell, so\n\n47\n00:02:16.538 --> 00:02:22.076\nthat's because my column is not wide\nenough to display all of that text.\n\n48\n00:02:22.076 --> 00:02:24.518\nSo we're gonna start doing those things.\n\n49\n00:02:24.518 --> 00:02:28.704\nBut let's just review really quickly\nabout our mouse cursor icons,\n\n50\n00:02:28.704 --> 00:02:31.458\nbecause they're so very important in here.\n\n51\n00:02:31.458 --> 00:02:33.556\nWhen I'm over cells,\nwe have our white plus sign.\n\n52\n00:02:33.556 --> 00:02:38.429\nBut if I'm over my column references,\nand that's where I'm on my A,\n\n53\n00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:41.993\nB, C, Ds,\nyou get the black arrow pointing down.\n\n54\n00:02:41.993 --> 00:02:46.335\nAnd when you see that,\nyou will be able to click, and\n\n55\n00:02:46.335 --> 00:02:49.514\nyou have selected the entire column.\n\n56\n00:02:49.514 --> 00:02:56.566\nAll the way down to 1,048,000 throw,\nsame thing with our rows.\n\n57\n00:02:56.566 --> 00:02:59.113\nIf I wanted to select\nthe entire row which would be\n\n58\n00:02:59.113 --> 00:03:00.976\nall of the column that are in there,\n\n59\n00:03:00.976 --> 00:03:05.229\nyou have all over the column reference get\nthe black error pointing to the right.\n\n60\n00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:08.710\nYou click and then it goes ahead and\nselects that whole row.\n\n61\n00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:14.130\nGreat, now you could select multiple rows\nand columns, because part of this episode,\n\n62\n00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.600\nwe're not just gonna talk about\ncolumn widths and heights.\n\n63\n00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.530\nBecause that\n\n64\n00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.301\nreally takes all of about 30 seconds-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n65\n00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:19.966\n&gt;&gt; To show you really quickly.\n\n66\n00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:23.302\n[LAUGH] We're gonna talk about\ninserting columns and deleting columns,\n\n67\n00:03:23.302 --> 00:03:24.294\nand hiding columns.\n\n68\n00:03:24.294 --> 00:03:31.154\nSo we need to make sure we get this base\ncovered of how to select them first.\n\n69\n00:03:31.154 --> 00:03:35.987\nSo with the black arrow pointing to the\nright if I wanted to select columns, 2,\n\n70\n00:03:35.987 --> 00:03:38.800\nsorry, rows 2 through 6,\nyou click hold and\n\n71\n00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.920\njust drag down just like\nyou were selecting cells.\n\n72\n00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.770\nBut this time you're\nselecting whole rows across.\n\n73\n00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.213\nClicking off into somewhere deselect,\nsame with our columns arrow pointing down.\n\n74\n00:03:50.213 --> 00:03:55.170\nIf I wanted to select column C, D, and\nE, you click hold and drag across and\n\n75\n00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.200\nnow I have selected all of\nthose particular columns.\n\n76\n00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.907\nYou also have your Shift clicks and\nyour Ctrl clicks if you wanted to\n\n77\n00:04:03.907 --> 00:04:08.966\nselect columns B, get that arrow\npointing down, hold your Shift key.\n\n78\n00:04:08.966 --> 00:04:12.128\nClick over black arrow\npointed out on column H and\n\n79\n00:04:12.128 --> 00:04:14.372\nit'll select that entire range.\n\n80\n00:04:14.372 --> 00:04:19.660\nClick off, or if I want column E and\ncolumn H, hold your Ctrl key and\n\n81\n00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:26.003\nthen click on each one of those column\nreferences, same with your rows as well.\n\n82\n00:04:26.003 --> 00:04:30.950\nSo everything we were doing with like\nselecting variable amounts of cells,\n\n83\n00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.450\nwith our Shift key and our Ctrl key.\n\n84\n00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.057\nWe're doing the same thing here\nwith our column references.\n\n85\n00:04:36.057 --> 00:04:39.240\nSo making sure we know\nhow to select to effect.\n\n86\n00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.207\nAnd then of course, we have our all\nbutton which is in where our row and\n\n87\n00:04:44.207 --> 00:04:49.274\ncolumn references intersect and\nthat would select the entire sheet.\n\n88\n00:04:49.274 --> 00:04:51.102\nJust a quick little detour,\n\n89\n00:04:51.102 --> 00:04:55.838\nlet's say for some reason you're\nlike I've lost my column references.\n\n90\n00:04:55.838 --> 00:04:59.906\nAnd I've had this happen where\npeople are like I don't see any As,\n\n91\n00:04:59.906 --> 00:05:02.531\nI don't see any Ds, that's a view thing.\n\n92\n00:05:02.531 --> 00:05:06.470\nIf you go over to View, do you see\nwhere it has headings right up here?\n\n93\n00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.727\nIf this somehow gets checked off,\nwell then you don't have those references.\n\n94\n00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:14.814\nSo that could be a little misguided and\na little misleading there, so\n\n95\n00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:17.150\nmake sure your headings are turned on.\n\n96\n00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.410\nAnd while I'm here, this is another one,\n\n97\n00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.630\nI will talk about this when we talk\nabout formating our worksheets.\n\n98\n00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.502\nPeople said I've lost all of the lines and\n\n99\n00:05:24.502 --> 00:05:26.918\nI'm like what do you mean\nyou've lost all the lines?\n\n100\n00:05:26.918 --> 00:05:31.464\nAnd I don't see any, because the grid\nlines have been some how turned off.\n\n101\n00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:32.244\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So it looks like\n\n102\n00:05:32.244 --> 00:05:32.885\na piece of paper, yeah.\n\n103\n00:05:32.885 --> 00:05:33.902\nSo it looks like a piece of paper.\n\n104\n00:05:33.902 --> 00:05:36.335\nAnd like I don't know where they start and\nstop.\n\n105\n00:05:36.335 --> 00:05:37.908\n&gt;&gt; Someone is really good\nat lining up the words.\n\n106\n00:05:37.908 --> 00:05:39.608\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, yeah.\n\n107\n00:05:39.608 --> 00:05:44.425\nSo just a few little things, I just\nwanted to take a quick little detour\n\n108\n00:05:44.425 --> 00:05:49.264\nbecause it happens, so at least you\nknow where to go back and fix them.\n\n109\n00:05:49.264 --> 00:05:51.613\nNow changing our column widths.\n\n110\n00:05:51.613 --> 00:05:55.269\nWe have our black arrow pointing down for\nselecting, but\n\n111\n00:05:55.269 --> 00:05:58.328\nif you come in between\nyour column references.\n\n112\n00:05:58.328 --> 00:06:01.838\nYou get the black line with\ntwo arrows off to the side,\n\n113\n00:06:01.838 --> 00:06:05.361\nthat indicates that you can\nchange the column width.\n\n114\n00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:07.004\nThere's two ways that you can do this.\n\n115\n00:06:07.004 --> 00:06:08.464\n&gt;&gt; I learned one.\n\n116\n00:06:08.464 --> 00:06:09.521\nYou double-click it.\n\n117\n00:06:09.521 --> 00:06:10.321\n&gt;&gt; You do.\n\n118\n00:06:10.321 --> 00:06:10.858\n&gt;&gt; I love it.\n\n119\n00:06:10.858 --> 00:06:11.905\n&gt;&gt; And what does that do?\n\n120\n00:06:11.905 --> 00:06:18.636\n&gt;&gt; And it moves the column out as wide\na your widest data in that column.\n\n121\n00:06:18.636 --> 00:06:19.581\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n122\n00:06:19.581 --> 00:06:20.246\n&gt;&gt; Look at me.\n\n123\n00:06:20.246 --> 00:06:20.854\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n124\n00:06:20.854 --> 00:06:23.196\n&gt;&gt; Look at that I learned something,\n\n125\n00:06:23.196 --> 00:06:23.848\nI did it.\n\n126\n00:06:23.848 --> 00:06:25.899\nSo you're correct, it's the auto fit.\n\n127\n00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:26.484\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n128\n00:06:26.484 --> 00:06:28.801\nthat's what it's technically called,\nbut you described it exactly.\n\n129\n00:06:28.801 --> 00:06:30.443\n&gt;&gt; That was a much\nbetter way of saying it.\n\n130\n00:06:30.443 --> 00:06:33.355\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Double clicking will go ahead\n\n131\n00:06:33.355 --> 00:06:37.547\nand make that column to the widest\nvalue within that column and\n\n132\n00:06:37.547 --> 00:06:40.464\nthen that's the width that you will have.\n\n133\n00:06:40.464 --> 00:06:42.827\nThat is one way,\nI think it was the easiest way.\n\n134\n00:06:42.827 --> 00:06:43.621\n&gt;&gt; I would too.\n\n135\n00:06:43.621 --> 00:06:44.630\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But\n\n136\n00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.210\nyou can change it by clicking and\ndragging.\n\n137\n00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.956\nSo if I click, hold, and drag,\ncuz maybe if I double-click,\n\n138\n00:06:50.956 --> 00:06:56.144\nthat's that's a little too small, cuz I\nwant just a little more breathing room.\n\n139\n00:06:56.144 --> 00:07:00.120\nSo I can click, hold and\ndrag that out to go ahead and change that.\n\n140\n00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:05.402\nAnd this is the same if you wanted to do\none column, three columns, all columns.\n\n141\n00:07:05.402 --> 00:07:09.346\nFor example, if I click, hold,\nand drag across all of these and\n\n142\n00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:13.963\nthen double-click between any of them,\ncould be between D and E or E and F.\n\n143\n00:07:13.963 --> 00:07:18.332\nIf I double-click, it will auto\nfit all three of those columns, so\n\n144\n00:07:18.332 --> 00:07:19.646\nthat could be nice.\n\n145\n00:07:19.646 --> 00:07:25.774\nOr if I have them all selected, if I come\nbetween D and E and start dragging it.\n\n146\n00:07:25.774 --> 00:07:31.118\nYou see I'm actually changing the width\nequal for all three of those columns.\n\n147\n00:07:31.118 --> 00:07:36.644\nSo you can use the multiple selections or\njust one or a couple or all of them.\n\n148\n00:07:36.644 --> 00:07:39.820\nYou want all of the columns\njust automatically just fit?\n\n149\n00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.871\nSelect that column at there, do\nthe Ctrl+A, double-click, and then poof,\n\n150\n00:07:43.871 --> 00:07:44.940\nlook at that.\n\n151\n00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:48.194\nEverything fits,\neverything looks beautiful.\n\n152\n00:07:48.194 --> 00:07:49.386\nDaniel's over here doing that.\n\n153\n00:07:49.386 --> 00:07:52.966\n&gt;&gt; I'm just like, where were you the-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n154\n00:07:52.966 --> 00:07:54.798\n&gt;&gt; Whole time that I've been struggling\n\n155\n00:07:54.798 --> 00:07:55.893\nthrough my Excel use.\n\n156\n00:07:55.893 --> 00:07:57.136\nI just hated this product for so long.\n\n157\n00:07:57.136 --> 00:07:59.278\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because it just seemed so obtuse to me,\n\n158\n00:07:59.278 --> 00:08:00.961\njust because I didn't\nknow how to use it and,\n\n159\n00:08:00.961 --> 00:08:02.441\nEverybody was wanting me to use it now.\n\n160\n00:08:02.441 --> 00:08:05.771\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm a non conformist, what can I say.\n\n161\n00:08:05.771 --> 00:08:08.457\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's one of those products that,\n\n162\n00:08:08.457 --> 00:08:11.620\nlike you're saying,\npeople are forcing me to use it.\n\n163\n00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:12.320\nWell just go ahead and\n\n164\n00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:16.605\nmake an Excel Spreadsheet and\nsend it to me and, like, I don't know.\n\n165\n00:08:16.605 --> 00:08:18.370\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Why don't I just go ahead and\n\n166\n00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.565\nbuild the Chrysler Building\nwhile I'm at it!\n\n167\n00:08:20.565 --> 00:08:22.220\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well it's funny you've said it cuz it\n\n168\n00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.850\nis kind of forced on us.\n\n169\n00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:27.160\nEverything in business and\neverything in the office,\n\n170\n00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:32.140\nit's all revolved around Excel,\nand everybody struggles with it.\n\n171\n00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:35.010\nI hear so many people say, man Excel.\n\n172\n00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:38.490\nAnd I'm like, but Excel's so easy.\n\n173\n00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:41.100\nWell, wait, let me back up, it's not easy.\n\n174\n00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:45.600\nIt still boggles my mind sometimes when I\nget really far down that rabbit hole and\n\n175\n00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.885\nI'm just like [SOUND].\n\n176\n00:08:46.885 --> 00:08:51.486\nIt's those basics that once you learn\nthem, to me, I'm like but it's so\n\n177\n00:08:51.486 --> 00:08:52.480\nnice actually.\n\n178\n00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.390\n[LAUGH] I mean,\nit's all relative to what you know.\n\n179\n00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:57.840\n&gt;&gt; Well, I did the whole cart\nbefore the horse thing and\n\n180\n00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.737\nit made me go, this is not fun.\n\n181\n00:08:59.737 --> 00:09:02.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So I just steer clear of it.\n\n182\n00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:05.726\nBut now, I finally just went through\nsomething like this where I started from\n\n183\n00:09:05.726 --> 00:09:07.492\nthe beginning, learned the basics of them.\n\n184\n00:09:07.492 --> 00:09:11.088\nSo that things weren't outside\nof my comfort zone, and\n\n185\n00:09:11.088 --> 00:09:13.390\nI didn't know what was happening.\n\n186\n00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:16.120\nIt was all assumed that\nI knew those things,\n\n187\n00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.840\nit really would've made my\nlife a whole lot easier.\n\n188\n00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.515\n&gt;&gt; Just hence why we do this-\n&gt;&gt; Yes, hence why we do this, right.\n\n189\n00:09:20.515 --> 00:09:21.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And I love it.\n\n190\n00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:25.520\nSo we can go through and\nautofit our columns, select it all,\n\n191\n00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:30.140\ndo whatever type of variable\nselections of our columns.\n\n192\n00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.630\nThe same thing can be done with our rows.\n\n193\n00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:36.980\nIf I wanted my row to be higher,\nyou just come in between the one and\n\n194\n00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.390\nthe two, the three and the four.\n\n195\n00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:43.610\nClick, hold, drag, drag down,\nand then it makes that row wider.\n\n196\n00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:44.471\nNo higher, sorry!\n\n197\n00:09:44.471 --> 00:09:48.147\n[LAUGH] Wider, higher,\nand then you can see that.\n\n198\n00:09:48.147 --> 00:09:50.312\nNow, the alignments that happen in here,\n\n199\n00:09:50.312 --> 00:09:53.870\nthat's where we have it all\naligned to the bottom by default.\n\n200\n00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:59.258\nThere are some horizontal alignments\nthat happen, text goes to the left,\n\n201\n00:09:59.258 --> 00:10:03.288\nnumbers go to the right,\nthat's just how it defaults.\n\n202\n00:10:03.288 --> 00:10:08.118\nBut we will again go through formatting\nall of our information in another episode,\n\n203\n00:10:08.118 --> 00:10:10.980\nright now we're just\nmodifying the worksheet.\n\n204\n00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.530\nWhich is funny cuz modify and\nformat almost to me,\n\n205\n00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:14.660\nthey kinda mean the same thing.\n\n206\n00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:15.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n207\n00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:19.540\n&gt;&gt; But I try to just\ndifferentiate it a little bit.\n\n208\n00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:23.120\nLuckily we have show descriptions\nto let you know what's going on.\n\n209\n00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.130\nAll right so what do we have next?\n\n210\n00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:31.020\nSo, ooh, we have inserting and\ndeleting columns and/or rows.\n\n211\n00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:34.090\nAnd we also have the double click,\njust let back up just a second.\n\n212\n00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:36.730\nThe double clicking between your rows,\nwill go ahead and\n\n213\n00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:40.540\nautomatically change\nthat row height as well.\n\n214\n00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:44.740\nAnd if you selected them all and\nmade them all a little bit higher,\n\n215\n00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:48.720\nyou can do that to give all of your\nrows a lit bit more breathing room.\n\n216\n00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:53.081\nSo it doesn't have to be one or\nthe other in there, so\n\n217\n00:10:53.081 --> 00:10:56.267\nlet's make that a little bit higher.\n\n218\n00:10:56.267 --> 00:11:01.267\nBut inserting rows, cuz right now I\nhave Alice Wonderpaws she works in human\n\n219\n00:11:01.267 --> 00:11:04.874\nresources but\nthat doesn't really tell me anything.\n\n220\n00:11:04.874 --> 00:11:11.300\nI don't have headers across the top,\nso I need to insert a row.\n\n221\n00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:15.670\nSo if I come into row one, right here,\nI'm just gonna go ahead and select it.\n\n222\n00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:17.090\nYou don't have to select it first, so\n\n223\n00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:19.440\nI'm just trying to give\nyou a frame of reference.\n\n224\n00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:25.290\nIf you right click on the row reference,\nand then you choose Insert,\n\n225\n00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:29.480\nyou will always be inserting\nabove your current selection.\n\n226\n00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:34.020\nSo if I click there, perfect,\nnow everything that was in\n\n227\n00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:38.510\nrow one has moved down to row two and\nso on and so forth.\n\n228\n00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:41.200\nSo I'm inserting a new row for\n\n229\n00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.820\nme to be able to put in first,\nlast and so on and so forth.\n\n230\n00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:48.330\nI'm not gonna fill in\neverything right here.\n\n231\n00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:49.640\nLion, all right.\n\n232\n00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.990\nSo we're going to Escape and\ncancel that out.\n\n233\n00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:56.360\nSo that's how I can insert a row,\nwhat if I wanted to delete a row?\n\n234\n00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:00.848\nCuz maybe, let's say Cheetos Sticks\nright here this person\n\n235\n00:12:00.848 --> 00:12:04.203\ndoesn't work at our organization anymore.\n\n236\n00:12:04.203 --> 00:12:09.954\nSo I want to delete out Cheetos whole row,\nbecause if I just selected the text or\n\n237\n00:12:09.954 --> 00:12:16.080\nthe cells and hit delete, I'm still\nleft with a blank amount of information.\n\n238\n00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.320\nSo deleting the row would\nbe a little easier.\n\n239\n00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:23.780\nJust right click on the row reference and\nthen you have Delete.\n\n240\n00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:27.500\nSo I can delete that row,\nand there we go, perfect.\n\n241\n00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:32.229\nSo that would be things like maybe I\nwanted to separate out every change in\n\n242\n00:12:32.229 --> 00:12:32.780\ncolor.\n\n243\n00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:36.800\nSo we have red, green, yellow,\nthese are like team colors, let's say.\n\n244\n00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:40.940\nSo I find my row seven,\nI right click and I Insert and\n\n245\n00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.790\nthen it puts that row in between.\n\n246\n00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:48.290\nAnd I think you get the idea here of where\nyou can go ahead and insert and delete.\n\n247\n00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:52.960\nBut I do wanna tell you I've always gone\nfrom right clicking on the row references\n\n248\n00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.340\nor right clicking on\nthe column references.\n\n249\n00:12:55.340 --> 00:13:01.390\nBut you do have up here on the Home tab,\nyou have a section for insert, delete.\n\n250\n00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:06.549\nAnd so I could insert,\nnow notice right here I'm inserting cells.\n\n251\n00:13:06.549 --> 00:13:10.320\nAll right, well,\nwhere am I gonna insert the cell?\n\n252\n00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.610\nThen, how am I gonna shift everything,\ndo I want to shift everything down?\n\n253\n00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:15.460\nDo I want to shift\neverything to the right?\n\n254\n00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:22.210\nWell, if I choose down, notice that\nit shifts just that one cell down.\n\n255\n00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:25.945\nAnd this is where you can\nget really kind of confused,\n\n256\n00:13:25.945 --> 00:13:29.570\ncuz now everything's out of order,\nthey don't line up.\n\n257\n00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:34.000\nSo be careful about inserting cells and\n\n258\n00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.660\nshifting your information around,\nit can get a little weird.\n\n259\n00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:41.910\nI will say that sometimes when I've\ncopied something and pasting as I do,\n\n260\n00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:43.390\ndo you want to shift everything down?\n\n261\n00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:45.210\nDo you want to shift\neverything to the right?\n\n262\n00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:48.450\nYou will get those little\ndialog boxes that pop up that,\n\n263\n00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:52.150\nthey sometimes don't really,\nthey're not gonna hurt anything.\n\n264\n00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:55.050\nBut remember you always have your undo,\nwhich I just did, so\n\n265\n00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:56.790\nyou always go back to that.\n\n266\n00:13:56.790 --> 00:14:01.402\nAll right, so I can insert a row,\nlet's do an insert column,\n\n267\n00:14:01.402 --> 00:14:04.343\nbecause where does the column insert?\n\n268\n00:14:04.343 --> 00:14:09.129\nYou always go to the top, you right click,\nso let's just see what happens.\n\n269\n00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.005\nIt inserts to the left,\ndoesn't go to the right, goes to the left.\n\n270\n00:14:14.005 --> 00:14:19.210\nAnd so now everything that was in D has\nmoved over and now it lives in column E.\n\n271\n00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:25.592\nThe same things happens when you\ndelete a column, so let me undo this.\n\n272\n00:14:25.592 --> 00:14:31.077\nSo right here column C,\nif I right click on here and\n\n273\n00:14:31.077 --> 00:14:35.530\ndelete it, it doesn't go A, B, D now.\n\n274\n00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:39.410\nYou're not deleting the column reference,\nyou're just deleting the information that\n\n275\n00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:43.500\nwas in there and everything then\nmoves over and takes a new reference.\n\n276\n00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.720\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne, does that mess\naround with if you had formulas or\n\n277\n00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.020\nanything as we get into that?\n\n278\n00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.860\nDo you have to take that into account?\n\n279\n00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:51.620\n&gt;&gt; Well it depends.\n\n280\n00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:55.157\n&gt;&gt; It depends? [LAUGHS] &gt;&gt; It depends on\nif your using relative references within\n\n281\n00:14:55.157 --> 00:14:57.300\nyour functions or formulas.\n\n282\n00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.080\nYou should be fine,\n\n283\n00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:01.650\nbecause now it realizes everything\nthat was there has moved over.\n\n284\n00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:04.290\nSo my references that I'm using in my\n\n285\n00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:05.200\nformulas-\n&gt;&gt; Needs to change.\n\n286\n00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.350\n&gt;&gt; Will also move over.\n\n287\n00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:09.170\n&gt;&gt; Does it do that automatically or\ndo we have to manually do that?\n\n288\n00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:10.136\n&gt;&gt; As long as they're relative references.\n\n289\n00:15:10.136 --> 00:15:11.150\n&gt;&gt; Got you.\n\n290\n00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:14.360\n&gt;&gt; And,\nit is relative references by default,\n\n291\n00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.910\nyou have to force it into what is\nknown as an absolute reference.\n\n292\n00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:21.020\nOne of our absolute references that we\nalways talk about is like a tax rate.\n\n293\n00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:24.702\nSay I have all of these, but I have to\ntax it, or times it by this tax rate?\n\n294\n00:15:24.702 --> 00:15:28.704\nAnd I put that up there, and\nI want it when I'm copying down my form,\n\n295\n00:15:28.704 --> 00:15:31.750\nI always want it to go\nto that particular cell.\n\n296\n00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:35.055\nDon't ever change your formula,\nthis is an absolute reference.\n\n297\n00:15:35.055 --> 00:15:36.720\nThose dollar signs that we've been seeing,\nand\n\n298\n00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.612\nsome of those things,\nyou have to make it that.\n\n299\n00:15:39.612 --> 00:15:40.200\n&gt;&gt; Got you.\n\n300\n00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:44.480\n&gt;&gt; So that would be the only time that\nyou would really need to be careful.\n\n301\n00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.819\nBut you should always\ndouble check to make sure.\n\n302\n00:15:46.819 --> 00:15:47.849\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, never hurts.\n\n303\n00:15:47.849 --> 00:15:50.406\n&gt;&gt; And, you know, the more complex it is,\nthat's what's gonna happen.\n\n304\n00:15:50.406 --> 00:15:51.625\n[LAUGH] All right, so\n\n305\n00:15:51.625 --> 00:15:55.363\nI just did an undo really quickly\nto bring that column back in.\n\n306\n00:15:55.363 --> 00:15:56.605\nSo, inserting.\n\n307\n00:15:56.605 --> 00:16:01.616\nDeleting and I could select multiple\ncolumns and then insert and\n\n308\n00:16:01.616 --> 00:16:07.289\nthen it inserts two more columns to\nthe left and that could be kind of fun.\n\n309\n00:16:07.289 --> 00:16:12.563\nCuz maybe for example here I want to,\noops that's a little bit too much,\n\n310\n00:16:12.563 --> 00:16:16.410\nI want to take it, come on let's zoom in.\n\n311\n00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:20.725\nOkay, whoa, all right, well I don't know\nwhere we're going now so why don't you\n\n312\n00:16:20.725 --> 00:16:25.380\ncome back over here and I will click the\nlittle buttons to go ahead and zoom in.\n\n313\n00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:30.810\nMaybe I wanna take these two columns,\nI have the department and\n\n314\n00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:35.040\nthe phone number but I wanna put\nthat at the end, you can cut these.\n\n315\n00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:39.932\nIf I cut these out, we're not gonna take\nit out just yet, I can then come over and\n\n316\n00:16:39.932 --> 00:16:44.625\nselect columns J and K and then paste\nit and now I've moved everything over.\n\n317\n00:16:44.625 --> 00:16:49.482\nNothing has really kinda shifted up and\ndown cuz I'm taking the entire column,\n\n318\n00:16:49.482 --> 00:16:51.378\nnot the content, the column.\n\n319\n00:16:51.378 --> 00:16:55.281\nBut now I have two other columns over\nhere that I don't need just, select them,\n\n320\n00:16:55.281 --> 00:16:57.974\nright click, and\nthen you can delete and they go away.\n\n321\n00:16:57.974 --> 00:17:01.363\nSo kind of like changing\nstuff around make sure-\n\n322\n00:17:01.363 --> 00:17:02.538\n&gt;&gt; It's like a three card monty,\n\n323\n00:17:02.538 --> 00:17:03.451\njust shifting things.\n\n324\n00:17:03.451 --> 00:17:04.443\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n325\n00:17:04.443 --> 00:17:05.428\n&gt;&gt; Over here, where's the queen?\n\n326\n00:17:05.428 --> 00:17:06.081\nWhere's the queen?\n\n327\n00:17:06.081 --> 00:17:09.363\n&gt;&gt; Make sure you do it by the columns or\nthe rows.\n\n328\n00:17:09.363 --> 00:17:13.440\nDon't do it by the content, that can\ncertainly mess you up a little bit.\n\n329\n00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:16.548\nAll right, now hiding.\nThis is one of those hm,\n\n330\n00:17:16.548 --> 00:17:18.795\nwhy would I ever want to do this.\n\n331\n00:17:18.795 --> 00:17:19.825\nThere's a whole bunch of reasons.\n\n332\n00:17:19.825 --> 00:17:21.554\nI do it a lot for printing.\n\n333\n00:17:21.554 --> 00:17:22.468\n&gt;&gt; Cuz Vaughn's sneaky.\n\n334\n00:17:22.468 --> 00:17:25.125\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; She likes to hide stuff.\n\n335\n00:17:25.125 --> 00:17:25.810\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I do it for\n\n336\n00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:30.018\nprinting purposes cuz I really only\nwant to print out the first and\n\n337\n00:17:30.018 --> 00:17:32.540\nlast names and their street address.\n\n338\n00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:35.884\nI don't need anything else.\nI do not need these three columns when I'm\n\n339\n00:17:35.884 --> 00:17:36.750\nprinting.\n\n340\n00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:39.616\nSo now there are things-\n&gt;&gt; You just saved me a bunch more time.\n\n341\n00:17:39.616 --> 00:17:41.215\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know that, right?\n\n342\n00:17:41.215 --> 00:17:42.771\n&gt;&gt; Good, I'm so bad, I love this.\n\n343\n00:17:42.771 --> 00:17:45.647\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Just typically what I would\nhave done was had to copy all of that\n\n344\n00:17:45.647 --> 00:17:46.630\ninformation.\n\n345\n00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:50.590\nOpen up a new or sheet or something, paste\nit in there and then print that sheet,\n\n346\n00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:51.460\ndelete it.\n\n347\n00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.337\nAnd as you can see I'm deep\ninto some work at this point.\n\n348\n00:17:53.337 --> 00:17:54.265\n&gt;&gt; Well yeah just hide.\n\n349\n00:17:54.265 --> 00:17:54.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n350\n00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:55.569\n&gt;&gt; Sounds easy.\n\n351\n00:17:55.569 --> 00:17:58.660\nSo I could just take\nthis I can right click.\n\n352\n00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:01.943\nSo you select the columns that you want,\nyou can hide them.\n\n353\n00:18:01.943 --> 00:18:04.445\nAnd when I hide them now\nthey're just hiding.\n\n354\n00:18:04.445 --> 00:18:06.312\nSo now I just print this and I'm done.\n\n355\n00:18:06.312 --> 00:18:11.745\nSo, [LAUGH] He's doing this.\n\n356\n00:18:11.745 --> 00:18:15.620\n[LAUGH] Now the thing is,\nif you can hide them, unhiding them,\n\n357\n00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:18.710\nthere's one little trick because you're\nlike, okay, now let me unhide them.\n\n358\n00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:20.980\nAnd how do I know that I\nactually have hidden columns?\n\n359\n00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:24.160\nA, B, C, D, E, F, J.\n\n360\n00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:24.677\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n361\n00:18:24.677 --> 00:18:26.491\n&gt;&gt; Now they're not deleted.\n\n362\n00:18:26.491 --> 00:18:31.060\n&gt;&gt; Plus there's like a little weird\ndouble line thing there between F and J.\n\n363\n00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:34.259\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah so\nthat's another indication.\n\n364\n00:18:34.259 --> 00:18:38.810\nSo you think, okay well let's just go\nahead and right click and I will unhide.\n\n365\n00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:40.783\nOkay.\n\n366\n00:18:40.783 --> 00:18:41.996\nLet's unhide.\n\n367\n00:18:41.996 --> 00:18:42.561\nNo.\n\n368\n00:18:42.561 --> 00:18:43.068\nOkay.\n\n369\n00:18:43.068 --> 00:18:44.604\n[LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n370\n00:18:44.604 --> 00:18:50.661\nYou have to, okay so we have A,\nB,C,D, E, F, G, H, I.\n\n371\n00:18:50.661 --> 00:18:51.354\nThose are the three ones.\n\n372\n00:18:51.354 --> 00:18:55.179\nBut, those are between F and J.\n\n373\n00:18:55.179 --> 00:19:01.693\nSo if you select F through J,\nyou're really selecting [NOISE].\n\n374\n00:19:01.693 --> 00:19:03.955\nYou're selecting all columns\nin between there too.\n\n375\n00:19:03.955 --> 00:19:04.515\n&gt;&gt; Sneaky.\n\n376\n00:19:04.515 --> 00:19:10.897\n&gt;&gt; So you have to say now I want to\nunhide what's between those two areas.\n\n377\n00:19:10.897 --> 00:19:13.157\n&gt;&gt; I will have to say that\nis not very intuitive.\n\n378\n00:19:13.157 --> 00:19:15.360\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; That's not something you like.\n\n379\n00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.282\nWell maybe if I select from\nhere to here and then it will,\n\n380\n00:19:18.282 --> 00:19:19.972\nI wouldn't have thought that.\n\n381\n00:19:19.972 --> 00:19:21.003\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAnd I do the same thing.\n\n382\n00:19:21.003 --> 00:19:23.078\nAnd so anytime I teach this part,\nit's like,\n\n383\n00:19:23.078 --> 00:19:24.950\nthat's what I've always been missing.\n\n384\n00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:25.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n385\n00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.414\n&gt;&gt; So, I'm gonna undo that for\na second to show you another one and\n\n386\n00:19:28.414 --> 00:19:29.985\nthen maybe I'll do a couple over here.\n\n387\n00:19:29.985 --> 00:19:32.483\nCuz I can hide rows, too.\n\n388\n00:19:32.483 --> 00:19:34.811\nIf you don't where they're hiding.\n\n389\n00:19:34.811 --> 00:19:38.982\nLike I wouldn't think to select\nbetween F through J just go up and\n\n390\n00:19:38.982 --> 00:19:42.235\nselect the whole sheet,\nselect the whole sheet.\n\n391\n00:19:42.235 --> 00:19:44.742\n&gt;&gt; And unhide.\n&gt;&gt; And then you can unhide here,\n\n392\n00:19:44.742 --> 00:19:51.136\nunhide your columns, unhide your rows and\nthen everything's right there.\n\n393\n00:19:51.136 --> 00:19:53.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's probably the way\nI'll have to do it from now on.\n\n394\n00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:59.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and the thing is be careful about\nhiding versus making the columns so\n\n395\n00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:02.140\nnarrow, that they look\nlike they're hiding.\n\n396\n00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:06.220\nFor example, if I take E and\njust make it really small,\n\n397\n00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:09.120\nI'll even make it like past that,\nyou get those double lines.\n\n398\n00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:09.740\n&gt;&gt; It does, it looks like it's hiding.\n\n399\n00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:10.253\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n400\n00:20:10.253 --> 00:20:13.146\nSo, okay, so\nI'll select it like you told me.\n\n401\n00:20:13.146 --> 00:20:14.382\nAnd I will unhide.\n\n402\n00:20:14.382 --> 00:20:16.456\n&gt;&gt; It actually does do that.\n\n403\n00:20:16.456 --> 00:20:17.417\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It just did it for me.\n\n404\n00:20:17.417 --> 00:20:18.425\n&gt;&gt; It's like a manual hide.\n\n405\n00:20:18.425 --> 00:20:21.226\nI'm like, I'm not gonna go through\nthat whole right-clicking business.\n\n406\n00:20:21.226 --> 00:20:23.382\nI'll just slide this over until it's gone.\n\n407\n00:20:23.382 --> 00:20:26.272\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's funny because I've tried this\n\n408\n00:20:26.272 --> 00:20:30.982\nbefore and it didn't unhide, and I was\nlike, maybe I didn't select it properly.\n\n409\n00:20:30.982 --> 00:20:32.498\nBut\n&gt;&gt; You probably didn't select the range.\n\n410\n00:20:32.498 --> 00:20:35.325\n&gt;&gt; You know what wait I might have done\nsomething here let's try this again.\n\n411\n00:20:35.325 --> 00:20:35.896\nLet's go like that.\n\n412\n00:20:35.896 --> 00:20:39.076\n&gt;&gt; Like super small but not past it.\n\n413\n00:20:39.076 --> 00:20:43.825\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and that may be what\nit was when I unhide it there.\n\n414\n00:20:43.825 --> 00:20:44.693\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n415\n00:20:44.693 --> 00:20:46.227\n&gt;&gt; I think I just taught myself something.\n\n416\n00:20:46.227 --> 00:20:49.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I think if you just take\n\n417\n00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:51.473\ninput go it past\n&gt;&gt; Okay seriously,\n\n418\n00:20:51.473 --> 00:20:56.278\nI'm just learning this right now [LAUGH]\nWe're all learning with you, Vonne.\n\n419\n00:20:56.278 --> 00:20:59.030\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right so if you take this past,\n\n420\n00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:01.400\nokay so right there,\nwe're not past are we?\n\n421\n00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.660\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's not technically hiding.\n\n422\n00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:05.110\n&gt;&gt; You take it past there.\n\n423\n00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:06.200\nI just hid that column.\n\n424\n00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.450\n&gt;&gt; You did.\n&gt;&gt; I didn't even\n\n425\n00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:08.290\nknow how to do-\n&gt;&gt; Sweet.\n\n426\n00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:09.640\nI bet you could do it with rows.\n\n427\n00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:11.586\n&gt;&gt; You could.\n[LAUGH]\n\n428\n00:21:11.586 --> 00:21:12.098\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n429\n00:21:12.098 --> 00:21:13.730\n&gt;&gt; Wow, okay, seriously I didn't,\n\n430\n00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:15.730\nI never thought to make it.\n\n431\n00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:17.920\n&gt;&gt; Smaller or narrow than it was.\n\n432\n00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:19.810\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And then we go past that.\n\n433\n00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:20.870\n&gt;&gt; Cuz why would you do that?\n\n434\n00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:22.570\n&gt;&gt; Why would I do that?\n\n435\n00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:24.065\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Obviously to hide things.\n\n436\n00:21:24.065 --> 00:21:25.210\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I always say this in\n\n437\n00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:26.000\nmy course overviews.\n\n438\n00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.900\nThere's always more than one way to\ndo something in all these products.\n\n439\n00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.030\n&gt;&gt; It's true.\n&gt;&gt; So I just learned one and\n\n440\n00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:34.700\nnow since I unhide them you see how\n&gt;&gt; Small there?\n\n441\n00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So now we can go, and\n\n442\n00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:39.200\nthat's where I'd probably\nselect it all again.\n\n443\n00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:42.440\nJust auto fit everything to\nmake sure we're all there.\n\n444\n00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.960\nGreat, so we're learning all\nsorts of little tips and\n\n445\n00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.420\ntricks about everything here.\n\n446\n00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:51.270\nLike I said, you also have up\nhere on your Format button,\n\n447\n00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:53.840\nyou have the row height This is\nwhere you could go ahead and\n\n448\n00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:58.970\ndetermine specifically how high you\nwant that particular row that you're in.\n\n449\n00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:04.530\nSo if I selected this went into\nrow height I could type in 25 and\n\n450\n00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:05.760\nyou can see that that is higher.\n\n451\n00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:09.640\nSo if you wanted a specific amount\nyou could do it from there.\n\n452\n00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:13.100\nBut you can see you also have\nyour column with the auto fits.\n\n453\n00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:17.900\nSo the hides and unhides and so\non and so forth that we have done.\n\n454\n00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.670\nANd the insert and delete information.\n\n455\n00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:22.020\nOne more thing about the insert.\n\n456\n00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:26.060\nJust wanted to show you like if\nI selected this and copied it,\n\n457\n00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:30.990\nif I came up to say row one and\nI right click on this.\n\n458\n00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:35.570\nNotice that I don't just have insert,\nI have insert copied cells.\n\n459\n00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:38.220\nAnd when I say insert copied cells\n\n460\n00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:42.240\nthis is where I was gonna tell you where\nthe whole shift down, or shift right.\n\n461\n00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:47.550\nRemember I'm doing all of this and\nI'm inserting it into a new row.\n\n462\n00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:51.830\nSo when I say shift down everything\nwill shift down from there.\n\n463\n00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:54.870\nSo just kind of know that If you copy and\n\n464\n00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:58.590\ntry to insert it into a new row,\nit will give you that warning.\n\n465\n00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:01.910\nAnd that's the one where I said,\nthat's where it won't mess anything up.\n\n466\n00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:03.360\nThis is the example.\n\n467\n00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.430\nCool.\nSo one of the things that I wanted\n\n468\n00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:10.470\nto talk about with modifying\na worksheet is merging cells.\n\n469\n00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:13.560\nSo I have another worksheet over here.\n\n470\n00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:16.260\nThat we will be doing some formats.\n\n471\n00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:19.756\nMerge, merging cells means, merge cells.\n\n472\n00:23:19.756 --> 00:23:22.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You take a bunch of cells and\n\n473\n00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:23.520\nyou make them all into one.\n\n474\n00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.170\nWe've seen this in\nthe Christmas Cat's example\n\n475\n00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:29.420\nwhere you have like a big\nheading across the top.\n\n476\n00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:34.010\nSo you are gonna have to determine how\nmany cells do I want to select and\n\n477\n00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:35.880\ncreate into one big one.\n\n478\n00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:41.430\nI'll just demonstrate over here\nIf I select L3 through M4,\n\n479\n00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:45.700\nthose four cells,\nI want them to become one cell.\n\n480\n00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:49.550\nThis is where you go into your merge,\nthere is a couple options.\n\n481\n00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:51.814\nNow it says merge and\ncenter, what does that mean?\n\n482\n00:23:51.814 --> 00:23:56.901\nIt means merge them all together and\nthen center the contents inside of it.\n\n483\n00:23:56.901 --> 00:23:58.561\nI'm gonna do that with the other example.\n\n484\n00:23:58.561 --> 00:24:02.971\nFor now, if you drop this\ndown You have merge across or\n\n485\n00:24:02.971 --> 00:24:08.870\nyou have merge into merged cells,\nmerge all the selected into one.\n\n486\n00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:10.040\nThat's what I would like.\n\n487\n00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:14.190\nIf I click that,\nnotice that my active cell becomes one.\n\n488\n00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:17.300\nSo this is a cell,\nthis is a cell, this is a cell.\n\n489\n00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:20.690\nAnd if I just really quickly format it,\nyou can see the difference.\n\n490\n00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:24.030\nIf you wanted to start kind\nof blocking stuff out.\n\n491\n00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:27.640\nYou can do that in merging your cells.\n\n492\n00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:32.270\nNow if I merge a cell,\nyou could also unmerge them.\n\n493\n00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:36.867\nNotice that unmerge is available to me\nnow because, well, I have it merged.\n\n494\n00:24:36.867 --> 00:24:39.560\n[LAUGH] If I was on this cell and\n\n495\n00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:43.682\ntry to go to unmerge, it's gonna\nsay I didn't do anything, right.\n\n496\n00:24:43.682 --> 00:24:45.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's, I can't do that so\n\n497\n00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:52.160\nif I choose unmerge, notice now that\nthey all become individual cells.\n\n498\n00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:57.540\nIt looks like it's one because\nI have some fill on it,\n\n499\n00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:00.680\nbut if I have no fill now you\ncan see the divisions there.\n\n500\n00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.580\nSo just merging creates one.\n\n501\n00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:07.363\nMerging and centering, like I said, takes\nthe content and puts it in the center.\n\n502\n00:25:07.363 --> 00:25:11.449\nIt's kind of like making Word.\n\n503\n00:25:11.449 --> 00:25:14.321\nAnd merge and\ncenter always got me when I first.\n\n504\n00:25:14.321 --> 00:25:17.770\nI couldn't understand it, cuz I would\nselect this one cell, and click merge and\n\n505\n00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:20.580\ncenter, and I'm like that didn't\ndo anything that I wanted to.\n\n506\n00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:22.840\nYou gotta select the range.\n\n507\n00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:28.590\nSo if I select across from 1A though,\nlet's go with, H1.\n\n508\n00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:32.840\nThis is the space, merge them and center.\n\n509\n00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:37.780\nThat's what it does,\ncreate one big one, perfect.\n\n510\n00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:41.450\nAnd so now I have merged and\ncentered that cell.\n\n511\n00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:45.230\nI could do the same thing\ndown here with our notes.\n\n512\n00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:48.870\nIf I move down a little bit,\nI can select all,\n\n513\n00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:50.860\ncuz right here,\nlook where all the content is.\n\n514\n00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:53.560\nIt says,\nsales were low due to the holiday.\n\n515\n00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:58.420\nAnd I can scroll on over, and\nsee all the information that is in here.\n\n516\n00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:00.660\nIt's in one cell.\n\n517\n00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:03.880\nI want it to become one big cell.\n\n518\n00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:09.530\nSo if I select them all it will only take\nthe content of what's in that first cell.\n\n519\n00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:15.380\nIf I had information like down in here,\nI'll just type in the word the and\n\n520\n00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:19.990\nI select all of this and\nI merge the cells.\n\n521\n00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:25.520\nIt will say hey it's only gonna\nkeep the upper left hand value and\n\n522\n00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.300\ndiscard anything else that's in there.\n\n523\n00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.940\nSo you do have to be\na little careful about that.\n\n524\n00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.700\nIn this situation I'm doing\nas a demonstration purpose,\n\n525\n00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:34.310\nlike we're cool with that.\n\n526\n00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:37.380\nI really only do want\nthe first top left corner.\n\n527\n00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:39.620\nThen it selects all of it you're like yay.\n\n528\n00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.000\nWell kind of,\nI don't know what just happened.\n\n529\n00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.370\n&gt;&gt; Some weird stuff.\n\n530\n00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:45.700\n&gt;&gt; Yea, well it looks weird.\n\n531\n00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:46.660\n&gt;&gt; It does look weird.\n\n532\n00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:47.830\n&gt;&gt; I know what happened.\n\n533\n00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:53.440\nJust because you merged it,\nwell what about all of the extra text.\n\n534\n00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.290\nIt's still all up there\nlook at the formula bar.\n\n535\n00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:55.790\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n536\n00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:59.170\n&gt;&gt; Says Puma is dealing with clients\nbeing out of town, Bishop had to work for\n\n537\n00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:01.080\ncovering Buttercup's shift.\n\n538\n00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.470\nRight well I can merge it but\nthen you've got the text wrap.\n\n539\n00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:07.150\nAnd this is in that one episode where we\nsaid well can't I just make it into that\n\n540\n00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:07.660\none cell?\n\n541\n00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:10.560\nI'm like you can there it is.\n\n542\n00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.888\nSo, my next step would\nbe to wrap the text.\n\n543\n00:27:13.888 --> 00:27:15.805\nOkay,\n&gt;&gt; Much better\n\n544\n00:27:15.805 --> 00:27:17.174\n&gt;&gt; Much better,\n\n545\n00:27:17.174 --> 00:27:18.970\nand then if I didn't have a lot of text.\n\n546\n00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:25.630\nLet's say maybe I took out all\nof this from the formula bar.\n\n547\n00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:27.360\nSo now I just have-keep on going.\n\n548\n00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:32.200\nKeep on going, there we go, perfect.\n\n549\n00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:35.690\nYou see how now I got it wrapped but\n\n550\n00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:38.310\nthere's not enough to kind\nof fill that whole area,\n\n551\n00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:41.960\nit's because it's down to the bottom\n&gt;&gt; Bottom justifying,\n\n552\n00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.640\nthat's weird\n&gt;&gt; We can change that right up here\n\n553\n00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.050\nin our alignment.\n\n554\n00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:49.850\nThere is your top align,\nmiddle align, and bottom align.\n\n555\n00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:53.370\nIt's always bottom align by default, so\n\n556\n00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:55.590\nyou take that to the top, or to the middle\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n557\n00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:59.650\nthen you could always center the text,\nor left align or right align.\n\n558\n00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:01.470\nThis gets into our formatting, but\n\n559\n00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:06.170\nI can't, it's like I can't not tell\nyou [LAUGH] about the alignment.\n\n560\n00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:06.910\nBecause also,\n\n561\n00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:11.740\nit would just drive me crazy cuz I'm\nvery picky about those types of things.\n\n562\n00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:16.880\nSo the word wrap, we have the align, the\nvertical alignment, the merge and center.\n\n563\n00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:20.120\nTaking and\nselecting the amount of information or\n\n564\n00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:24.630\ncells I want to merge across then\nautomatically centering our text and\n\n565\n00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:26.880\nthen merging everything the column width.\n\n566\n00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:30.250\nWe've talked about a lot of\nmodifying our worksheet and\n\n567\n00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:34.320\nhopefully this will tame the dragon\na little bit more for you.\n\n568\n00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:37.370\nAnd make it to where I can use Excel.\n\n569\n00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:38.080\nI can do this.\n\n570\n00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.550\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Now that I understand how\n\n571\n00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:40.610\nthe column width works.\n\n572\n00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:45.390\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't seem like such a mighty\nfoe anymore [LAUGH] as it were.\n\n573\n00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:47.330\nBecause you're expanding your\nknowledge base of it and\n\n574\n00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:49.600\nsaying it's not that difficult.\n\n575\n00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.380\nAnd in these newer versions of Excel,\n\n576\n00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:54.320\nthey definitely have tried to\nmake the intuitiveness of it.\n\n577\n00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:57.690\nPutting the things in the ribbon,\nmaking it so customizable.\n\n578\n00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:01.860\nAnd then working with the formatting\ninside of the workbook itself,\n\n579\n00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:06.500\nvery much easier than what I was used\nto from back in the day which just.\n\n580\n00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.092\nI got gun shy, I'm not gonna lie.\n\n581\n00:29:08.092 --> 00:29:09.180\n[LAUGH] Maybe you were too.\n\n582\n00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:13.690\nAnd now we're starting to see the light,\nwe're becoming proselytites of Excel.\n\n583\n00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:14.980\nWe'll use it until the day is long.\n\n584\n00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:16.810\nWe're going to sing its praises, right?\n\n585\n00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:17.516\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yvonne,\n\n586\n00:29:17.516 --> 00:29:19.025\nis there anything else we\nhave to add in this episode?\n\n587\n00:29:19.025 --> 00:29:20.316\n&gt;&gt; I think we've covered it all.\n\n588\n00:29:20.316 --> 00:29:23.920\nWe're going to move into formatting our\nworksheet to where we're going to make\n\n589\n00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:27.843\nthings bold and pretty, and we're going to\ngussy it up with some pinks, and purples,\n\n590\n00:29:27.843 --> 00:29:28.410\nand blues.\n\n591\n00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:29.370\nI'm sure you're going to love it.\n\n592\n00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:30.680\n&gt;&gt; Let's get it all gussied, then.\n\n593\n00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:31.400\nAll right, everyone.\n\n594\n00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.560\nThanks for joining us.\n\n595\n00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:35.185\nIn this episode, it is time for\nus to sign off, for OfficeProTV.\n\n596\n00:29:35.185 --> 00:29:36.743\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n597\n00:29:36.743 --> 00:29:37.684\n&gt;&gt;

It's great.\n\n10\n00:00:25.315 --> 00:00:26.200\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes it is.\n\n11\n00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.905\n&gt;&gt; It's great.\n\n12\n00:00:27.905 --> 00:00:29.870\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Are you Tony the Tiger?\n\n13\n00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know why I\njust threw that out there,\n\n14\n00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.510\nI just, it just came out, so.\n\n15\n00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But we, as you're saying,\n\n16\n00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.090\nwe're continuing on with\nour essential series.\n\n17\n00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.920\nAnd we've been talking about modifying\na workbook, or I think we did worksheets.\n\n18\n00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.130\nAnd then, we changed column width,\nyou were really excited about that,\n\n19\n00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.750\nthat you were like, that's so easy.\n\n20\n00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.810\n&gt;&gt; That was fantastic, thank you.\n\n21\n00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:50.580\n&gt;&gt; It was, yes.\n\n22\n00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.250\nSo we're going to continue on\nwith now formatting a worksheet.\n\n23\n00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.260\nNow, if you think about formatting and\nmodifying, it kinda mean the same thing.\n\n24\n00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.860\nWe're really doing that, but I wanted to\ntry to keep it separate cuz normally when\n\n25\n00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.810\nI think of format, I always equated with\nfont and color and things like that.\n\n26\n00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.100\nSo that's why we wanted to go ahead and\nuse this title.\n\n27\n00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.100\nThat's exactly what we're going to be\ncovering, things like font and color.\n\n28\n00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.600\n[LAUGH] And\nI'll throw some alignment in there.\n\n29\n00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.490\nWe'll also go ahead and talk about some\nstyles and copying some formats and\n\n30\n00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.020\ndifferent things.\n\n31\n00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.530\nSo if you've done this in Word or in\nPowerPoint, this should be very familiar,\n\n32\n00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.940\nbut in Excel, it goes a little bit more,\nI guess you could say.\n\n33\n00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.780\nBecause we are in a tabular\nformat of where we have cells.\n\n34\n00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.770\nWe're not just like selecting\nparagraphs and so on and so forth.\n\n35\n00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.360\nSo, you have a whole other cell\nformatting that you go with and\n\n36\n00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.440\nso we will definitely be getting\ninto that particular dialog box and\n\n37\n00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.820\ntalking about borders and things of that.\n\n38\n00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.590\nSo, yes, there's borders and\nshading in Word, but\n\n39\n00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.682\nit does act a little bit different,\nit's the same but different.\n\n40\n00:01:56.682 --> 00:01:58.335\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's the same but different.\n\n41\n00:01:58.335 --> 00:01:59.136\n&gt;&gt; My favorite saying.\n\n42\n00:01:59.136 --> 00:02:03.780\n[LAUGH] So I have a file called Format a\nWorksheet that I have opened already, and\n\n43\n00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.140\nwe have our Christmas Cat Sales.\n\n44\n00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.390\nAnd we're gonna start with\nthis Meowy Christmas.\n\n45\n00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.880\nI'm not punny, so, [LAUGH] I wanted to put\nthis off to the side, because I wanted to\n\n46\n00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.290\nconcentrate on this particular area\nof the Home tab in the font group.\n\n47\n00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.850\nAnd when you click on this drop down,\n\n48\n00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.373\nthis going to drop down\nall the different fonts.\n\n49\n00:02:23.373 --> 00:02:27.960\nNow, I could talk forever about fonts and\nfont families,\n\n50\n00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.650\nand font foundries but I'll-\n&gt;&gt; You'll digress.\n\n51\n00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.190\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, I will.\n\n52\n00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.900\n&gt;&gt; I've been there ladies and\ngentlemen, it ain't pretty.\n\n53\n00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.632\nIt just delves down and\nits like a meat grinder.\n\n54\n00:02:38.632 --> 00:02:41.170\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I feel that I've seen a couple\n\n55\n00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.830\nof these where I'm like let me\nkeep back about this and then.\n\n56\n00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.380\nAll right, so\nI'm just gonna keep it here to where\n\n57\n00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.740\nthese are the fonts that\nare installed in your computer.\n\n58\n00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.250\nNow the thing is if you see\ndifferent fonts than what\n\n59\n00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.860\nI have listed well then you have other\nfonts installed on your computer.\n\n60\n00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.460\nSo it does go a little bit deeper\nthan just the program level\n\n61\n00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.390\nas to what you have either purchased or\nmaybe you have the Adobe suite or\n\n62\n00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.020\nsome other type of software that\nis adding other fonts to it.\n\n63\n00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.610\nOr you've downloaded some free fonts or\nyou've purchased fonts.\n\n64\n00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.295\nSee, I'm already starting to digress\na little bit right here, but\n\n65\n00:03:13.295 --> 00:03:15.345\nthis is your choice.\n\n66\n00:03:15.345 --> 00:03:17.383\nThis is your list, so pick from it.\n\n67\n00:03:17.383 --> 00:03:24.445\nYou also have your hover to discover and\nyour previewing of your text.\n\n68\n00:03:24.445 --> 00:03:27.685\nI guess I should back up slightly\nin the sense that you do need to\n\n69\n00:03:27.685 --> 00:03:28.835\nselect to effect.\n\n70\n00:03:28.835 --> 00:03:30.805\nYou need to have the cell or\n\n71\n00:03:30.805 --> 00:03:36.470\ncells selected before you come over to\naffect it so that would be step one.\n\n72\n00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.950\nAnd then if I hover over this you can see\nthat the font is changing right there in\n\n73\n00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.915\nreal time to be able to see what's\nit's look like in Berlin Sans, which\n\n74\n00:03:46.915 --> 00:03:50.713\nis a font that I usually like to pick and\nusually I really don't past the b's.\n\n75\n00:03:50.713 --> 00:03:54.500\n[LAUGH] Like there's so many of them so\nwe will pick right here.\n\n76\n00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.010\nMaybe a good Comic Sans would be good too,\nyeah.\n\n77\n00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.978\n&gt;&gt; Bauhaus 93, yeah.\n\n78\n00:03:58.978 --> 00:04:00.339\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you wanna do that one?\n\n79\n00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:01.813\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Sure.\n&gt;&gt; All right, where is that?\n\n80\n00:04:01.813 --> 00:04:02.855\n&gt;&gt; It's up.\n\n81\n00:04:02.855 --> 00:04:03.398\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n82\n00:04:03.398 --> 00:04:04.457\n&gt;&gt; B-A-U.\n\n83\n00:04:04.457 --> 00:04:05.035\n&gt;&gt; There it is, okay.\n\n84\n00:04:05.035 --> 00:04:09.888\n[LAUGH] Wow, okay, B-A-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n85\n00:04:09.888 --> 00:04:11.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Remember your skills.\n\n86\n00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.980\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n87\n00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.580\n&gt;&gt; So we have our font here and\nthen the box right next to it,\n\n88\n00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.580\nthat would be our font size.\n\n89\n00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:17.860\nWe could drop this down and\n\n90\n00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:23.130\nwe have our different integers increments,\nI should say of fonts.\n\n91\n00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.260\nSo we can go ahead and hover over this to\nsee how big these different fonts are,\n\n92\n00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.330\nwell, let's go with 24.\n\n93\n00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.910\nNow, if you really wanted it\nto be 23.5 you type that in,\n\n94\n00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.770\nyou don't have these as your only\nchoices for typing in fonts.\n\n95\n00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.891\nBut you would have to click in here and\ntype in 23.5.\n\n96\n00:04:40.891 --> 00:04:43.870\nI would just hit the Tab\nkey to accept that.\n\n97\n00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.330\nSo you do have these half sizes if\nyou wanna say and go from there.\n\n98\n00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.570\nAnd the next little buttons,\n\n99\n00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.360\nthese are just your, I call them\nthe bumpy buttons because it's just going\n\n100\n00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.550\nto bump you up in those different\nincrements to where I kind of bump it up.\n\n101\n00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.170\nNow notice that I can make it bigger,\nbut it's like,\n\n102\n00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.720\nwell I can't really see it anymore.\n\n103\n00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.620\nThat's where you can\nchange your row height.\n\n104\n00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.300\nWe talked about this in our other episode.\n\n105\n00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.880\nTo where it can come over between the one\nand the two and then just go ahead and\n\n106\n00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.480\nmake that row higher so\nyou can be able to see all of this text.\n\n107\n00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.000\nFor now, we're just going to bump it down\na little bit and 28, that sounds good.\n\n108\n00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.240\nWe'll keep on moving.\n\n109\n00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.290\nLet's go to the next buttons\ndown here in this group.\n\n110\n00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:31.370\nWe have our Bold, Italic and\nour Underline Ctrl+B, Ctrl+I, Ctrl+U.\n\n111\n00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.370\nYou could also come into\nyour double Underline.\n\n112\n00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.370\nNow, this is different than your border.\n\n113\n00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.040\nSo let me show you the Double Underline.\n\n114\n00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.270\nSee where the lines go?\n\n115\n00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:45.380\nThey're actually going under the text,\nnot the border of the cell.\n\n116\n00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.230\nSo there are two different\nthings going on with that.\n\n117\n00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:55.080\nAnd I'm gonna just take the Underline off,\njust like if you had put on a B or an I.\n\n118\n00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.050\nLot of times it would be like\nhow do I Unbold something?\n\n119\n00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.630\nWell there's no Unbold button.\n\n120\n00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's like a light switch.\n\n121\n00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.570\nYou either have Bold on or\nyou have the Bold off.\n\n122\n00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.390\n&gt;&gt; That's a really good way of putting it,\nbecause you're right,\n\n123\n00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.280\neverybody is looking for\nan Unbold, but it's not that.\n\n124\n00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.450\nIt's either affected or\nit's not, it's on or it's off.\n\n125\n00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:15.930\n&gt;&gt; And that's what that little kinda\ngray box is over that U right there,\n\n126\n00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.870\nsaying that the Underline is on.\n\n127\n00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:22.330\nSo now we need to take it off, just\nclick it again, and it turns off, okay.\n\n128\n00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.920\nIt's a very simple thing, but it's one of\nthose, I can see why people overlook it.\n\n129\n00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And so I up,\n\n130\n00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.580\nyeah, it makes sense, yeah.\n\n131\n00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.058\nSo that's why I started using the on and\noff reference,\n\n132\n00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:33.905\nwell I guess the light bulb thing.\n\n133\n00:06:33.905 --> 00:06:38.540\n[LAUGH] And I did have a roommate in\ncollege that it wasn't like turn off\n\n134\n00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.205\nthe lights, turn on the lights, it was\nclose the lights and open the lights,\n\n135\n00:06:43.205 --> 00:06:47.890\ncuz English wasn't her first language, and\n\n136\n00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:53.010\nGreek was her first language, and\nhow it translated, it translates to close.\n\n137\n00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.840\n&gt;&gt; That's interesting.\n\n138\n00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, she was like, close the lights.\n\n139\n00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.905\nSo I'm like, but then I had started using,\nso I just thought it was so cool.\n\n140\n00:06:57.905 --> 00:06:59.854\n&gt;&gt; You were look for a pair of shutters,\nor like curtains or something.\n\n141\n00:06:59.854 --> 00:07:05.841\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so I thought that\nwas fun, so again, I digress.\n\n142\n00:07:05.841 --> 00:07:07.973\n[LAUGH] So we're coming back over here.\n\n143\n00:07:07.973 --> 00:07:09.830\nLet's move over to the Fill Color.\n\n144\n00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.890\nSo this is going to fill in the cell.\n\n145\n00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.240\nNotice if I select this blue or\nthis yellow,\n\n146\n00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:22.350\nit's only filling in that one cell because\nthere's no information next to a column.\n\n147\n00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:25.630\nAnd that's why I don't see\neverything kind of cut off.\n\n148\n00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:26.950\nSo that's the whole idea,\n\n149\n00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:31.340\nwhere does the information live in\nthe cell, that is our cell color.\n\n150\n00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.510\nThen the Text Color, over here,\nwe could go ahead and\n\n151\n00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:37.340\npick whatever color you want from there.\n\n152\n00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:42.260\nAnd now why is that not selecting, okay.\n\n153\n00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.300\nThat's a little strange,\ndo you see how its?\n\n154\n00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.440\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n&gt;&gt; But then it applies on.\n\n155\n00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.680\n&gt;&gt; Very funny, maybe it's just cause\nyou just have that one cell selected.\n\n156\n00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.946\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but that was weird,\n\n157\n00:07:51.946 --> 00:07:55.209\nI just got finished saying how all\nthe information lives in that cell.\n\n158\n00:07:55.209 --> 00:07:59.215\nMeowy Christmas is in that one, so\nI was like what's going on there?\n\n159\n00:07:59.215 --> 00:08:01.433\nThink we'll blame our virtual-\n&gt;&gt; But what's funny.\n\n160\n00:08:01.433 --> 00:08:06.892\nSo the C character in Christmas is\nactually barely making it into the M cell.\n\n161\n00:08:06.892 --> 00:08:07.458\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n162\n00:08:07.458 --> 00:08:11.746\n&gt;&gt; And if you look really closely, you can\nsee that it is affecting the color of it,\n\n163\n00:08:11.746 --> 00:08:13.124\nor it was a second ago.\n\n164\n00:08:13.124 --> 00:08:14.181\n&gt;&gt; Right there.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there it is.\n\n165\n00:08:14.181 --> 00:08:15.270\n&gt;&gt; I can see it.\n&gt;&gt; Just barely.\n\n166\n00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:16.489\n&gt;&gt; I totally see what you're saying.\n\n167\n00:08:16.489 --> 00:08:17.671\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's a little strange.\n\n168\n00:08:17.671 --> 00:08:19.197\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I will say,\n\n169\n00:08:19.197 --> 00:08:21.254\nI will blame it on the virtual machine.\n\n170\n00:08:21.254 --> 00:08:23.294\nI don't know what I'm gonna blame it on.\n\n171\n00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:24.135\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n172\n00:08:24.135 --> 00:08:25.092\nI'm just gonna blame it on something.\n\n173\n00:08:25.092 --> 00:08:25.613\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n174\n00:08:25.613 --> 00:08:30.889\n&gt;&gt; But you can see that it is taking the\nwhole text of that cell when you apply it,\n\n175\n00:08:30.889 --> 00:08:34.036\nit's just that weird kinda hovering thing.\n\n176\n00:08:34.036 --> 00:08:36.064\nThat's one of those things\nyou maybe you close it.\n\n177\n00:08:36.064 --> 00:08:39.853\nOpen the whole program back up and it\nmight fix the whole, like turning it on,\n\n178\n00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:41.362\nturning it off again.\n\n179\n00:08:41.362 --> 00:08:42.526\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n180\n00:08:42.526 --> 00:08:43.383\n&gt;&gt; That nice good restart might help that.\n\n181\n00:08:43.383 --> 00:08:46.932\nSo we're just gonna do the hand wave,\nand say,\n\n182\n00:08:46.932 --> 00:08:47.778\n&gt;&gt; That's right, pay no attention to that.\n\n183\n00:08:47.778 --> 00:08:48.648\n&gt;&gt; Not sure what just happened.\n\n184\n00:08:48.648 --> 00:08:51.047\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's okay.\n\n185\n00:08:51.047 --> 00:08:54.990\nSo those are the different things you\ncan do with your font and your size and\n\n186\n00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.719\nthe color and things like that.\n\n187\n00:08:56.719 --> 00:08:59.144\nLet's move on to borders.\n\n188\n00:08:59.144 --> 00:09:04.051\nNow this is the one that,\nit can get a little weird if you're not\n\n189\n00:09:04.051 --> 00:09:07.578\nfully paying attention to what's going on.\n\n190\n00:09:07.578 --> 00:09:10.593\nI guess that's the same in anything that\nwe do [LAUGH] in any of these programs.\n\n191\n00:09:10.593 --> 00:09:14.552\nSo let's take this cell\nparticularly right here, and\n\n192\n00:09:14.552 --> 00:09:17.918\nnow you can see that you\nhave a borders button.\n\n193\n00:09:17.918 --> 00:09:20.820\nAnd you do have to have the cell or\ncells selected.\n\n194\n00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.391\nMaybe we'll actually select these over\nhere, we're gonna select a group of them.\n\n195\n00:09:24.391 --> 00:09:29.331\nIf I drop this down, we have different\nbottom borders, top borders, left,\n\n196\n00:09:29.331 --> 00:09:32.371\nright, you can read all\nthose ones down there.\n\n197\n00:09:32.371 --> 00:09:35.560\nSo maybe I'll go with Bottom Borders.\n\n198\n00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.997\nI have multiple cells selected here,\nso if I click that, like well,\n\n199\n00:09:38.997 --> 00:09:41.746\nthat didn't do anything,\nnow why didn't that work?\n\n200\n00:09:41.746 --> 00:09:43.759\nWhy didn't it do bottom borders?\n\n201\n00:09:43.759 --> 00:09:48.092\nWell, it did, you just can't see it,\nespecially when it's just black, and\n\n202\n00:09:48.092 --> 00:09:51.653\nit's not doing the bottom borders\nof all of the cells selected.\n\n203\n00:09:51.653 --> 00:09:56.202\nIt's within this range,\nI'm only gonna put a bottom border.\n\n204\n00:09:56.202 --> 00:10:01.380\nSo be kind of aware of what\nis actually being formatted.\n\n205\n00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:06.272\nNow if I did All Borders, then it's\ngonna do well, all borders there.\n\n206\n00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:11.209\nIf I don't want any borders on there,\nthen I can choose No Borders, and\n\n207\n00:10:11.209 --> 00:10:12.541\nso on and so forth.\n\n208\n00:10:12.541 --> 00:10:15.998\nAnd there's lots of different\noptions that you have here.\n\n209\n00:10:15.998 --> 00:10:20.172\nSo if I selected, let's say,\nall of these cells right there.\n\n210\n00:10:20.172 --> 00:10:24.563\nAnd I come into the Borders and\nI choose the bottom border,\n\n211\n00:10:24.563 --> 00:10:30.492\nit's going to apply for all those because\nthere wasn't anything on top of it.\n\n212\n00:10:30.492 --> 00:10:36.223\nBut there's some other things that you\ncould do with selecting certain borders.\n\n213\n00:10:36.223 --> 00:10:41.885\nLike, I want to have all the bottom\nborders, I want just the middle border or\n\n214\n00:10:41.885 --> 00:10:45.347\nit may be easier if I\ncould just draw my border.\n\n215\n00:10:45.347 --> 00:10:48.074\nSo there's a lot of different\nthings that you can do and\n\n216\n00:10:48.074 --> 00:10:49.801\nhow you apply the border setting.\n\n217\n00:10:49.801 --> 00:10:53.431\nSo let's drop this down cuz\nthere's a couple of other things\n\n218\n00:10:53.431 --> 00:10:56.207\ndown here like maybe I\nwanna change the color,\n\n219\n00:10:56.207 --> 00:11:00.353\nmaybe I wanna change the style in\nhere to have dotted and everything.\n\n220\n00:11:00.353 --> 00:11:04.088\nAnd this is where it gets a little,\nlet's say backwards.\n\n221\n00:11:04.088 --> 00:11:04.744\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n222\n00:11:04.744 --> 00:11:05.952\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna select this.\n\n223\n00:11:05.952 --> 00:11:08.784\nSo I'm thinking all right,\nI'm gonna drop this down and\n\n224\n00:11:08.784 --> 00:11:11.498\nI've chosen the bottom, and\nthen I come back to here,\n\n225\n00:11:11.498 --> 00:11:14.460\nand I come over here to line color and\nI'm gonna make it red.\n\n226\n00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.024\nAnd then it's like,\nwhy did it make it red?\n\n227\n00:11:17.024 --> 00:11:18.031\nBecause that's how you do it in Word.\n\n228\n00:11:18.031 --> 00:11:20.759\nAnd that's where I'm kinda used to,\nit's like, okay, here and\n\n229\n00:11:20.759 --> 00:11:22.035\napply to what I have selected.\n\n230\n00:11:22.035 --> 00:11:23.947\nWell, as soon as you start\nchanging those options there,\n\n231\n00:11:23.947 --> 00:11:25.127\nlook on my mouse cursor looks like.\n\n232\n00:11:25.127 --> 00:11:26.099\n&gt;&gt; It looks like a pencil.\n\n233\n00:11:26.099 --> 00:11:26.715\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n234\n00:11:26.715 --> 00:11:29.022\nIt's kind of like you're saying,\nyou want a different color?\n\n235\n00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:31.350\nI'm going to then pull out the crayon, and\n\n236\n00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:34.529\nthen you're gonna have to draw\nwhere you want the border.\n\n237\n00:11:34.529 --> 00:11:39.384\nSo it's a little different and that's why\nI say it's backwards than what I'm used to\n\n238\n00:11:39.384 --> 00:11:43.635\nin Word of just choose the drop down,\nchoose the size, choose the font, or\n\n239\n00:11:43.635 --> 00:11:47.296\nchoose the color, choose the type,\nand then choose the width.\n\n240\n00:11:47.296 --> 00:11:51.547\nNot here, it goes to the drawing\nthe border icon right there, and\n\n241\n00:11:51.547 --> 00:11:57.447\nif I drop this down, you see how that draw\nborder, it's like it's on, it's activated.\n\n242\n00:11:57.447 --> 00:11:59.584\nAnd as long as you know that\nthat's what it's gonna do,\n\n243\n00:11:59.584 --> 00:12:01.594\nthis is where it actually\ncan be a little easier now.\n\n244\n00:12:01.594 --> 00:12:05.155\nSo I'm gonna say, all right,\nlet me just take this and click, hold, and\n\n245\n00:12:05.155 --> 00:12:05.855\ndrag across.\n\n246\n00:12:05.855 --> 00:12:07.093\nAnd now I've got that.\n\n247\n00:12:07.093 --> 00:12:11.415\nMaybe I wanna put red bottom borders here,\nand then just for fun,\n\n248\n00:12:11.415 --> 00:12:13.151\nmight a go have over here.\n\n249\n00:12:13.151 --> 00:12:16.050\nOkay, now we're starting\nto get a little crazy.\n\n250\n00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:16.722\n&gt;&gt;

It's post modern art.\n\n327\n00:15:55.178 --> 00:15:58.196\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So clear formats.\n\n328\n00:15:58.196 --> 00:16:03.661\nThere is something to say about using\nthe Delete key on the keyboard versus\n\n329\n00:16:03.661 --> 00:16:10.350\nusing the Clear All or Clear format on the\nHome tab, Over here where it says, Clear.\n\n330\n00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:13.499\nFor example, if I selected,\nlet's just say,\n\n331\n00:16:13.499 --> 00:16:17.292\nthese couple of cells right here and\nI hit the Delete key.\n\n332\n00:16:17.292 --> 00:16:20.070\nYou're deleting the content but\nyou can even see it right there.\n\n333\n00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:27.440\nAll of the formats that were\nattached to this cell, stay.\n\n334\n00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.852\nAnd I've gotten that so\nmany different times.\n\n335\n00:16:28.852 --> 00:16:31.662\nI think we've talked about this\nwhen we were inputting in data.\n\n336\n00:16:31.662 --> 00:16:36.080\nIt's like, why is this turning into a\ndate, why is this doing some weird thing?\n\n337\n00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:39.780\nWell, because it's remembering\nwhatever format that it was there.\n\n338\n00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:45.249\nSo if you wanted to, not just clear\nout the contents, you wanna clear\n\n339\n00:16:45.249 --> 00:16:51.212\nout everything or just the formatting,\nyou have that button right there.\n\n340\n00:16:51.212 --> 00:16:55.730\nSee, Clear All means format and content.\n\n341\n00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:59.824\nIf I just choose Formats, then it's just\ngonna go ahead and give me the text.\n\n342\n00:16:59.824 --> 00:17:02.050\nBut take a notice on this one.\n\n343\n00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:03.820\nWhat did it do to those cells?\n\n344\n00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.429\nTook out the merged cells, too.\n\n345\n00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:08.930\nWhen it says All Formats,\nit means all formats.\n\n346\n00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:12.609\nThe merging, the alignment,\nthe number formats Even though we\n\n347\n00:17:12.609 --> 00:17:15.282\nhaven't covered number formats\nin the sequential order,\n\n348\n00:17:15.282 --> 00:17:17.531\nthe next episode we do\ntalk about number formats.\n\n349\n00:17:17.531 --> 00:17:19.450\nSo that's gonna get rid of it, too.\n\n350\n00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:21.250\nSo, it's like a strip all,\n\n351\n00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:24.855\nyou're only gonna get the text\nwhich can be good and bad.\n\n352\n00:17:24.855 --> 00:17:26.160\nYou have to kinda weigh it out.\n\n353\n00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.200\nIt's like, why do you really\nwanna get rid of the merge, but\n\n354\n00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.930\nI really wanted to get rid\nof all the other formats.\n\n355\n00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:32.720\nSo, then you can just go back and\nremerge it if you need to.\n\n356\n00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.637\nBut I figure we can take this,\n\n357\n00:17:34.637 --> 00:17:39.252\nsince we don't really have any number\nformats going on on these cells.\n\n358\n00:17:39.252 --> 00:17:43.960\nWe could go ahead in this Select All,\nand clear out everything.\n\n359\n00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:47.590\nAnd then we can get rid of I didn't wanna\nget rid of the contents, I'm sorry.\n\n360\n00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:49.524\n[LAUGH] I wanna get rid of the formats.\n\n361\n00:17:49.524 --> 00:17:52.857\nThere we go, and then we can go back and\nremerge our cells.\n\n362\n00:17:52.857 --> 00:17:59.207\nSo do you understand about the clearing\nversus just deleting the contents.\n\n363\n00:17:59.207 --> 00:18:01.860\nSo about copying formats.\n\n364\n00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:06.723\nLet's take this guy right here,\nfill it in with yellow and green.\n\n365\n00:18:06.723 --> 00:18:10.299\nThis is like USF colors,\nthat's where I went to school.\n\n366\n00:18:10.299 --> 00:18:10.946\nGo Bulls.\n\n367\n00:18:10.946 --> 00:18:13.830\nAnd then we're gonna take that,\nit was a little bit darker of a green.\n\n368\n00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:18.321\nSo I've got that, and\nwe'll make it Arial Black.\n\n369\n00:18:18.321 --> 00:18:22.080\nThis is formatting on\nthis particular cell.\n\n370\n00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:26.200\nI want this to be copied over to,\nsay, this cell and this cell and\n\n371\n00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.720\nsome other cells in there,\nthe formats, not the contents.\n\n372\n00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.200\nWe're not doing Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V.\n\n373\n00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.010\nWhat we can do is use,\nlet's call it the Format Painter.\n\n374\n00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:37.900\nThe Format Painter paints formats.\n\n375\n00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:42.044\nAnd it's just like painting a house and\nyou have a can of paint, right?\n\n376\n00:18:42.044 --> 00:18:44.839\nYou take the brush, and\nyou dip the brush into the can,\n\n377\n00:18:44.839 --> 00:18:46.560\nAnd then you come over here and\nyou paint on the walls.\n\n378\n00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.615\nSo whatever's in the can gets\nput on the walls, right?\n\n379\n00:18:48.615 --> 00:18:49.388\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Or at least that's,\n\n380\n00:18:49.388 --> 00:18:50.444\nI guess that's-\n&gt;&gt; That's the idea.\n\n381\n00:18:50.444 --> 00:18:51.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH] Or\n\n382\n00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:54.820\nI mean don't kick the can over or\nit's gonna spill everywhere.\n\n383\n00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:55.874\nI've never done that.\n\n384\n00:18:55.874 --> 00:18:58.380\n&gt;&gt; Stepped in the roller thing one time.\n\n385\n00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.320\nI was walking around like what's going on.\n\n386\n00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n387\n00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.908\n&gt;&gt; Little footprints all over the place.\n\n388\n00:19:02.908 --> 00:19:03.940\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That was awesome.\n\n389\n00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:04.990\n&gt;&gt; I've done that one too.\n\n390\n00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:05.891\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n391\n00:19:05.891 --> 00:19:08.079\ni actually did knock over\nthe entire paint can.\n\n392\n00:19:08.079 --> 00:19:09.296\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n393\n00:19:09.296 --> 00:19:11.528\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] It was like,\nthat was not a good time.\n\n394\n00:19:11.528 --> 00:19:18.762\nSo I've got here,it's the same idea\nto where I have the paint can here.\n\n395\n00:19:18.762 --> 00:19:22.660\nI've got a brush up here and\nso you select the cell.\n\n396\n00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:25.110\nAnd the nice thing is\nyou have your list here.\n\n397\n00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:28.736\nSelect the content, the format you like,\nclick the Format Painter.\n\n398\n00:19:28.736 --> 00:19:31.530\nIf I single-click it, look at my cursor,\n\n399\n00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:36.620\nlooks like a little paintbrush, and\nthen I select the cell that I want!\n\n400\n00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:40.648\nJust like that, we just talked about.\n\n401\n00:19:40.648 --> 00:19:43.618\nBut what about those spray guns, you know.\n\n402\n00:19:43.618 --> 00:19:47.696\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; I've never gotten the privilege, yes-\n\n403\n00:19:47.696 --> 00:19:48.303\n&gt;&gt; They're great.\n\n404\n00:19:48.303 --> 00:19:49.580\nThey're called airless sprayers.\n\n405\n00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:50.633\nI used to be a painter.\n\n406\n00:19:50.633 --> 00:19:51.713\nOkay, so you know about this.\n\n407\n00:19:51.713 --> 00:19:52.243\n&gt;&gt; I've worked with them, yes.\n\n408\n00:19:52.243 --> 00:19:52.933\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n409\n00:19:52.933 --> 00:19:56.777\nWell this is the real world\nexample I always give.\n\n410\n00:19:56.777 --> 00:19:59.080\nYou just turn the gun on,\nit just goes, right?\n\n411\n00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:02.450\nSo that's the whole idea here,\nis like I was just a one time thing.\n\n412\n00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:07.270\nIf I want to say, take this particular\nformatting and paint it everywhere,\n\n413\n00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:11.388\nYou double click the Format Painter and\nthen you've got that spray gun, basically.\n\n414\n00:20:11.388 --> 00:20:14.220\nSo if I double click,\nI've kind of activated it and\n\n415\n00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:19.225\nthen I can click here, and\nI can click here, and here, and here.\n\n416\n00:20:19.225 --> 00:20:22.710\nBut if it probably like something I would\ndo, I'd be like, gosh, here I'm going,\n\n417\n00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:23.891\nI'm going crazy, right?\n\n418\n00:20:23.891 --> 00:20:27.045\n[LAUGH] I'm going all over the place so\nyou gotta stop the gun.\n\n419\n00:20:27.045 --> 00:20:28.142\nYou gotta turn it off.\n\n420\n00:20:28.142 --> 00:20:32.210\nSo then, when you're done using that\nFormat Painter, you come up and\n\n421\n00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:32.980\njust turn it off.\n\n422\n00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:37.603\nAnd now, you don't have that initiated,\nif you wanna say, or activated.\n\n423\n00:20:37.603 --> 00:20:41.299\nSo, but this is really handy and\nthe Format Painter is in all of your\n\n424\n00:20:41.299 --> 00:20:45.540\nproducts so this works in Word this\nworks in PowerPoint, it's a lot of fun.\n\n425\n00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:47.166\nSo I really like that.\n\n426\n00:20:47.166 --> 00:20:50.710\nAnd then one other one\nthat I wanted to show you.\n\n427\n00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:53.763\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH] Well, I'm great, one.\n\n12\n00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.658\nTwo, this is Part 2.\n\n13\n00:00:33.658 --> 00:00:37.985\n[LAUGH] So we're continuing on\nwith formatting our worksheet, and\n\n14\n00:00:37.985 --> 00:00:40.930\nwe had left off with the format painter.\n\n15\n00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.070\nWe were talking about how to\nuse a fill handle, and so\n\n16\n00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.140\nnow we're gonna move on to how we're\ngonna do some alignments, right?\n\n17\n00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.489\nWe all need to be in sync and in a line.\n\n18\n00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.899\nSo we're going to do our vertical\nalignment, diagonal alignment,\n\n19\n00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:55.148\nhorizontal alignment.\n\n20\n00:00:55.148 --> 00:00:58.018\nAnd then there's actually something\nthat I forgot to tell you\n\n21\n00:00:58.018 --> 00:01:01.720\nabout with the cell fills with the\ndifferent ways that we can change that.\n\n22\n00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.719\nI'm gonna show you how to do a gradient\none, which is kind of hidden in there.\n\n23\n00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:07.710\nIt doesn't just jump out at\nyou like it does in Word.\n\n24\n00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.060\nSo I'll show where that's it,\n\n25\n00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.000\nbecause we are going to need to go back\ninto the Format Cells dialogue box.\n\n26\n00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.998\nSo I'm actually right where I\nleft off in the file that we were\n\n27\n00:01:18.998 --> 00:01:22.030\nworking in before in our part uno.\n\n28\n00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.412\nNow we're in part dos.\n\n29\n00:01:23.412 --> 00:01:25.549\nAll right, let's go over to,\n\n30\n00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.507\nwhy don't we jump over to\na different worksheet for now?\n\n31\n00:01:29.507 --> 00:01:32.960\nCuz we talked about our row\nhyphen column width there.\n\n32\n00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.090\nLet's just make this row 1 a little\nhigher, and you can see that the default\n\n33\n00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.250\nalignment of our cells is going\nto be on that bottom alignment.\n\n34\n00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.263\nAnd we did touch on this in\nthe modifier worksheet episode.\n\n35\n00:01:45.263 --> 00:01:49.530\nBut now we're in the format where\nwe'll take it to the next level.\n\n36\n00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.050\nUp here, let's go ahead, and first of all,\nselect the cells that we want to format.\n\n37\n00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.000\nBecause I could see,\nI almost went to go click that button and\n\n38\n00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.230\nrealized that like, wait,\nback up, where do I need to be?\n\n39\n00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.320\nSelect to affect.\n\n40\n00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.360\nSo let's take these cells right here, and\n\n41\n00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.680\nchange the alignment on the vertical\naxis up here on these little buttons.\n\n42\n00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.610\nDo I want it to be top of the line?\n\n43\n00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.355\nDo I want it to be bottom of the line?\n\n44\n00:02:14.355 --> 00:02:16.378\nBut notice if I click off to this,\n\n45\n00:02:16.378 --> 00:02:20.085\nthat it did not change that\nline because that's our border.\n\n46\n00:02:20.085 --> 00:02:21.358\nThat's our cell border,\n\n47\n00:02:21.358 --> 00:02:25.580\nso to wherever the bottom of that cell,\nthat's where it's going to stay.\n\n48\n00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.483\nSo that's a little bit different\nthan if we had underlines, but\n\n49\n00:02:28.483 --> 00:02:31.627\nthen it would also be only the words,\nso just kinda clarifying that.\n\n50\n00:02:31.627 --> 00:02:36.710\nAnd I like a nice vertical justification\nof a middle vertical justification.\n\n51\n00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.510\nJustification and alignment,\nthey mean the same thing.\n\n52\n00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.958\nSo another thing that we could do\nif I go ahead and select our cells,\n\n53\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:47.680\nis we could go ahead and do our\nhorizontal alignment left by default.\n\n54\n00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.073\nBut if I wanted it to be centered, I can\ncenter the text within each one of those\n\n55\n00:02:52.073 --> 00:02:54.451\ncells, or I can also make it right align.\n\n56\n00:02:54.451 --> 00:02:58.130\nI think I'll stick with our\ncenter alignment there, and\n\n57\n00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.610\nthat looks pretty good.\n\n58\n00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.150\nSome other things you can do\nbesides just doing vertical and\n\n59\n00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.460\nhorizontal, you could go diagonal.\n\n60\n00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.341\nAnd this is something\nthat I always think of,\n\n61\n00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:12.525\nI always remember it always equating\nback to school, aren't we, Daniel?\n\n62\n00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:14.217\nWe always talk about handwriting?\n\n63\n00:03:14.217 --> 00:03:17.357\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we love to muse on and\n\n64\n00:03:17.357 --> 00:03:19.715\non about the loops and swirls.\n\n65\n00:03:19.715 --> 00:03:23.067\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know where that came out of,\n\n66\n00:03:23.067 --> 00:03:27.460\nbut [LAUGH] I meant to say homework,\nbut I guess there's a w in there.\n\n67\n00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.418\n&gt;&gt; Handwriting homework?\n\n68\n00:03:28.418 --> 00:03:28.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n69\n00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.223\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Trying to help you out.\n\n70\n00:03:30.223 --> 00:03:31.019\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n71\n00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.504\nI actually had to have handwriting\nhomework, because it was so poor.\n\n72\n00:03:35.504 --> 00:03:36.076\n&gt;&gt; Abysmal?\n\n73\n00:03:36.076 --> 00:03:36.852\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n74\n00:03:36.852 --> 00:03:40.760\nI got like an N minus when I was in-\n&gt;&gt; What the heck is an N minus?\n\n75\n00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.833\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Do you remember\nthere was SUs and Ns?\n\n76\n00:03:43.833 --> 00:03:46.198\n&gt;&gt; No, we had As through F.\n\n77\n00:03:46.198 --> 00:03:51.579\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I guess,\nit was a public school in Stewart,\n\n78\n00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.945\nFlorida, JD Parker, home of the Cubs.\n\n79\n00:03:55.945 --> 00:03:57.657\n[LAUGH] I remember that.\n\n80\n00:03:57.657 --> 00:04:01.396\nLike an O for outstanding,\nS for satisfactory, N for\n\n81\n00:04:01.396 --> 00:04:04.565\nneeds improvement, NU is unsatisfactory.\n\n82\n00:04:04.565 --> 00:04:07.080\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\nI do remember that in kindergarten.\n\n83\n00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.784\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, I guess they were still\ndoing it when I was in fourth and\n\n84\n00:04:09.784 --> 00:04:10.554\nfive grade [LAUGH].\n\n85\n00:04:10.554 --> 00:04:12.796\n&gt;&gt; No, that was for the little kids.\n\n86\n00:04:12.796 --> 00:04:16.190\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, I obviously didn't do very well\n\n87\n00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.974\nin kindergarten handwriting,\nbecause mine is atrocious.\n\n88\n00:04:18.974 --> 00:04:23.008\n[LAUGH] It was so bad in college, I would\ntake all the notes, and I'd go back and\n\n89\n00:04:23.008 --> 00:04:26.629\nread them, and I'd be like,\nI can't even read my own handwriting.\n\n90\n00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:28.163\nBecause I'm just like, go, go, go.\n\n91\n00:04:28.163 --> 00:04:33.581\nSo yeah, anyways, I digress yet again,\nbut we always talk about school.\n\n92\n00:04:33.581 --> 00:04:37.826\nAnd this is where, coming back to this,\nI remember the teacher's notebook, and\n\n93\n00:04:37.826 --> 00:04:41.290\nthey would sometimes write\ndiagonally up in the boxes.\n\n94\n00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.330\nRight, because it was a longer title,\nbut they only had this wide, so\n\n95\n00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.910\nthey would kinda angle it up.\n\n96\n00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.220\nSo that's the whole idea of where\nI'm coming back with this story of\n\n97\n00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.520\nselecting our cells, and\nnow look, it's just easy.\n\n98\n00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.750\nYou just click a button and\ngo to the angular clockwise and boop.\n\n99\n00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:58.680\n&gt;&gt; Super sweet.\n\n100\n00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.749\n&gt;&gt; Look at that, so pretty easy to do.\n\n101\n00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:01.690\n&gt;&gt; It's like a ledger.\n\n102\n00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:02.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n103\n00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.606\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, ledgers do that, don't they?\n\n104\n00:05:03.606 --> 00:05:04.440\nYeah.\n\n105\n00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.746\n&gt;&gt; Gradebooks, right, you have to go up.\n\n106\n00:05:06.746 --> 00:05:10.198\nAnd that's where if you did\nhave a really small column,\n\n107\n00:05:10.198 --> 00:05:14.914\ncuz maybe you only have values that\nare a couple numbers, like test values.\n\n108\n00:05:14.914 --> 00:05:17.340\nBut you wanna set it like test one,\ntest two, test three.\n\n109\n00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.274\nAnd you wanna keep those columns small.\n\n110\n00:05:19.274 --> 00:05:23.830\nYou could select those cells, and then you\ncould just go ahead and go all the way up.\n\n111\n00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.893\nYou can rotate the text up, so\nyou can go ahead and put it that way.\n\n112\n00:05:26.893 --> 00:05:32.148\nSo pretty easy to do now in Excel, just\ngo ahead and selecting and changing it.\n\n113\n00:05:32.148 --> 00:05:36.618\nBut just like our bolds or anything else\nthat you have like a button that turns on\n\n114\n00:05:36.618 --> 00:05:39.867\nand off, this is back to that\nwhole where can I go ahead and\n\n115\n00:05:39.867 --> 00:05:43.105\nget the just regular\nhorizontal text button?\n\n116\n00:05:43.105 --> 00:05:45.647\nNope, you just turn the vertical off,\n\n117\n00:05:45.647 --> 00:05:49.360\nyou turn the rotation off from\nthis drop down right here.\n\n118\n00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.480\nAnd then it goes back down\nto being regular across.\n\n119\n00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.270\nNow, those are some pretty easy ones,\nthere's a 45 and a 90 degree angle there.\n\n120\n00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:02.620\nBut if you wanted, let's say,\na 62 degree angle in there,\n\n121\n00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.830\nyou can go into\nthe Format Cells Alignment,\n\n122\n00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:11.040\nwhich is just coming right back\ninto the Format Cells dialogue box.\n\n123\n00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.026\nReally quickly, just because I normally\nget to the Format Cells dialog box by\n\n124\n00:06:15.026 --> 00:06:16.630\nright-clicking on my cells.\n\n125\n00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:21.000\nIt's just kind of the like ingrained\nin the pattern that I go to.\n\n126\n00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.510\nSo I wanted to show you that\nyou can go right into here,\n\n127\n00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.420\ngo through all of your different tabs.\n\n128\n00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.723\nAnd if you're not on the Alignment tab,\n\n129\n00:06:27.723 --> 00:06:31.464\nthat's where you need to be to\nchange this guy right on over here.\n\n130\n00:06:31.464 --> 00:06:35.200\nYou have this little red diamond\nthat's over on the right hand side.\n\n131\n00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.387\nAnd you can drag this up or down,\nwhichever way you wanna go to,\n\n132\n00:06:39.387 --> 00:06:41.132\nwhere it gets into a 63.\n\n133\n00:06:41.132 --> 00:06:44.841\nOh,maybe let's go ahead and\nbump it down one more, and so,\n\n134\n00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:48.059\nyou can determine the angle\nthat you want it to be at.\n\n135\n00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:52.866\nAnd the other thing that we've been\ndoing through the buttons most likely,\n\n136\n00:06:52.866 --> 00:06:57.520\nwell, most of the time in this episode,\nthe horizontal, the vertical,\n\n137\n00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.393\nwe also have the wrap text,\nthe merge cells.\n\n138\n00:07:00.393 --> 00:07:04.427\nAnd those are the buttons that we did and\nworked about in and\n\n139\n00:07:04.427 --> 00:07:08.740\nwent over in the Modify a Workbook or\nWorksheet episode.\n\n140\n00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.020\nSo they're all from right in here,\nif you want it as well.\n\n141\n00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:17.661\nSo you can see, you can angle it to\nwhatever degree that you need it to be,\n\n142\n00:07:17.661 --> 00:07:19.802\nand that can be pretty fun.\n\n143\n00:07:19.802 --> 00:07:23.780\nNow let's move on to styles and themes.\n\n144\n00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.305\nI love styles.\n\n145\n00:07:25.305 --> 00:07:29.499\nThis is another thing that I could\ntalk forever about, but let's-\n\n146\n00:07:29.499 --> 00:07:30.077\n&gt;&gt; But won't.\n\n147\n00:07:30.077 --> 00:07:32.631\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I'm gonna keep it to where,\n\n148\n00:07:32.631 --> 00:07:36.540\nall right, we don't need\na three hour lecture on styles.\n\n149\n00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.910\nThe easiest way to say it, it was a style.\n\n150\n00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:40.450\nIt's a named group of formatting.\n\n151\n00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:42.596\nSo under one particular heading or\n\n152\n00:07:42.596 --> 00:07:47.483\nspecific name that has all of the\ndifferent formats and it's easily applied.\n\n153\n00:07:47.483 --> 00:07:51.943\nThe other cool thing about styles\nin general is that it's like\n\n154\n00:07:51.943 --> 00:07:56.229\na central location, and\nif I go ahead and apply that style,\n\n155\n00:07:56.229 --> 00:08:00.367\ncome back to where that style originates,\nchange that.\n\n156\n00:08:00.367 --> 00:08:05.683\nEverywhere where it's applied is going to\nadhere to those rules that you set for\n\n157\n00:08:05.683 --> 00:08:06.484\nthe style.\n\n158\n00:08:06.484 --> 00:08:08.450\nIt's gonna be super super handy.\n\n159\n00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:12.140\nWe've talked extensively\nabout this in Word, so\n\n160\n00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:16.370\nif you've watched those episodes, and\nyou're like, I love styles in Word.\n\n161\n00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:21.076\nThe same thing applies here in Excel,\nyou just have to kind of\n\n162\n00:08:21.076 --> 00:08:23.687\nthrow it into the Excel-\n&gt;&gt; World.\n\n163\n00:08:23.687 --> 00:08:24.997\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, world, exactly.\n\n164\n00:08:24.997 --> 00:08:27.900\nTo where the dialogue box\na little bit differently.\n\n165\n00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:32.140\nAnd you don't have the same functionality,\nI guess the same options,\n\n166\n00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.590\nI would say, that you do in Word.\n\n167\n00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.029\nBut it's the same but different.\n\n168\n00:08:37.029 --> 00:08:37.687\nGotta love it.\n\n169\n00:08:37.687 --> 00:08:42.079\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And yet does not violate\nthe law of non-contradiction.\n\n170\n00:08:42.079 --> 00:08:43.562\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I never do that.\n\n171\n00:08:43.562 --> 00:08:49.100\n[LAUGH] So let's come over here to\nour worksheet that I have an example.\n\n172\n00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.259\nThis looks pretty nice, doesn't it?\n\n173\n00:08:50.259 --> 00:08:51.370\n&gt;&gt; It does, actually.\n\n174\n00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:52.130\n&gt;&gt; Right?\nIt's all,\n\n175\n00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:56.120\nlike, uniform, it has a theme, right.\n\n176\n00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.609\nIt's looking pretty,\nand it's all very blue.\n\n177\n00:08:58.609 --> 00:09:04.510\nAnd this was really easy to format\nbecause I used cell styles.\n\n178\n00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:08.174\nUp here on the home tab, you can see\nwe have a cell styles drop down.\n\n179\n00:09:08.174 --> 00:09:11.270\nYou might actually see yours across,\ncuz if you have more resolution or\n\n180\n00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:14.624\nhigh resolution and more real estate you'd\nbe able to see it across and you can\n\n181\n00:09:14.624 --> 00:09:18.730\njust kinda click on the little buttons and\nthe little drop down over to the right.\n\n182\n00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:23.080\nOn mine, I have to drop this down to show\nyou all the ones of like heading one, two,\n\n183\n00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:23.740\nthree, four.\n\n184\n00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:27.140\nThis is the stuff we talk\nabout in Word extensively\n\n185\n00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:29.650\nwith structuring your documents.\n\n186\n00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:32.296\nSame idea here.\n\n187\n00:09:32.296 --> 00:09:35.870\nAnd this total,\nit's not actually performing calculations.\n\n188\n00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:39.660\nIt's really just the name of the style,\nand you can see it does, like,\n\n189\n00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:43.950\nthe double underlines on the bottom, the\nsingle on the top, and it makes it bold.\n\n190\n00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:48.590\nAnd so each one of this, if I single click\non this particular cell here, come over to\n\n191\n00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:52.960\nCell Styles, it's got a little box\naround it that says a Heading 1.\n\n192\n00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.670\nThis is, and\nI wish I could keep this open here.\n\n193\n00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:56.870\nThis is the totals one.\n\n194\n00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:58.470\nSo very simple.\n\n195\n00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:03.395\nAnd all of these colors and really all\nthe colors that we've done so far,\n\n196\n00:10:03.395 --> 00:10:04.937\nlike the font colors.\n\n197\n00:10:04.937 --> 00:10:05.660\nHere let me undo that.\n\n198\n00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.100\nI didn't mean to turn that green.\n\n199\n00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.440\nThe font colors, the fill colors.\n\n200\n00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:15.560\nAll of these things across the top are\nbased on the file theme or document theme.\n\n201\n00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.470\nBut I guess since these aren't really\ndocuments or workbooks we'll go with that.\n\n202\n00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:22.136\nSo all of it connects together.\n\n203\n00:10:22.136 --> 00:10:27.049\nAnd so if you change the theme, you're\ngonna change the default colors that\n\n204\n00:10:27.049 --> 00:10:30.275\nare available here in\nthe different variations or\n\n205\n00:10:30.275 --> 00:10:33.090\npercentages that you have with them.\n\n206\n00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:34.604\nAnd that goes, again,\n\n207\n00:10:34.604 --> 00:10:39.466\nright into those styles of why does\nit say 20% accent two, three, four?\n\n208\n00:10:39.466 --> 00:10:42.454\nBecause accent one,\ntwo, three, four, five,\n\n209\n00:10:42.454 --> 00:10:46.525\nsix is correlating into whatever\nthat is in that particular theme.\n\n210\n00:10:46.525 --> 00:10:49.781\nNow these other things up here\nwhere it says bad, good, neutral,\n\n211\n00:10:49.781 --> 00:10:51.385\ndoes that mean my cells are bad?\n\n212\n00:10:51.385 --> 00:10:53.588\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Bad, bad, no.\n\n213\n00:10:53.588 --> 00:10:58.390\n[LAUGH] No, it's more of just\nthe red fill with red text.\n\n214\n00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:03.484\nGreen fill with green text, and\ngreen go, red not so great.\n\n215\n00:11:03.484 --> 00:11:05.402\nSo that's the whole idea here.\n\n216\n00:11:05.402 --> 00:11:07.711\n&gt;&gt; Why do you think I hate stop lights?\n\n217\n00:11:07.711 --> 00:11:08.828\n[LAUGH] They're bad, they're red.\n\n218\n00:11:08.828 --> 00:11:10.415\n&gt;&gt; Why are you making me stop?\n\n219\n00:11:10.415 --> 00:11:16.377\n[LAUGH] Yeah, so it's probably a good\nthin that we have some thought points.\n\n220\n00:11:16.377 --> 00:11:19.924\n&gt;&gt; Not for me. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay,\nlet's keep on going to warning text.\n\n221\n00:11:19.924 --> 00:11:23.884\n[LAUGH] But we've got the different ways\nthat it is, and it's just, like I said,\n\n222\n00:11:23.884 --> 00:11:25.355\nnamed groups of formatting.\n\n223\n00:11:25.355 --> 00:11:29.540\nNow we can also make our own as well,\nand that will be in just a second.\n\n224\n00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:31.500\nWell, let's do some file\nwhat we've already got.\n\n225\n00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.370\nLet's come over here to another worksheet.\n\n226\n00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:34.850\nSales, Styles.\n\n227\n00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:36.530\nShow you how easy it is.\n\n228\n00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.500\nLet's select this cell right up here.\n\n229\n00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:41.040\nCome over to our sales, that is the title.\n\n230\n00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.120\nThat looks good.\n\n231\n00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.596\nSelect our cells here.\n\n232\n00:11:43.596 --> 00:11:46.820\nThese are headings something like that.\n\n233\n00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:51.740\nThe one, two, and three,\nI wouldn't emphasis this as much in Word\n\n234\n00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:56.250\nof like heading one, heading two of\nlike you're thinking about a book,\n\n235\n00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:58.940\na file like how you're\nstructuring your document.\n\n236\n00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:03.270\nThis really is a little bit more\nof some visual type of element.\n\n237\n00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:06.980\nSo I'll be cutting one that looks good and\nthat looks nice.\n\n238\n00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.770\nWe need to make our\ncolumns a little wider.\n\n239\n00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:09.920\nSo that's select all of them.\n\n240\n00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.750\nDouble click your favorite one,\nthe auto fit.\n\n241\n00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:20.080\nI wanna take these over here and\nI want to make those like a heading for.\n\n242\n00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:20.620\nLooks good.\n\n243\n00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:21.550\nSelect this.\n\n244\n00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:23.927\nI will hold my control key as well and\n\n245\n00:12:23.927 --> 00:12:27.502\nselect these cells and\nwe will format that as a total.\n\n246\n00:12:27.502 --> 00:12:28.230\nAnd look at that.\n\n247\n00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:32.250\nIn just a couple seconds right there,\nI've made this look pretty good.\n\n248\n00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:33.218\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, quiet nicely.\n\n249\n00:12:33.218 --> 00:12:34.620\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right?\n\n250\n00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.200\nAnd then I could come over here.\n\n251\n00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.364\nMaybe go ahead and throw that, put these,\n\n252\n00:12:38.364 --> 00:12:41.530\nI'll format all of these cells\nthat have our heading too.\n\n253\n00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:43.418\n&gt;&gt; Well this seems like you\nknow what you're doing here.\n\n254\n00:12:43.418 --> 00:12:44.661\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's weird.\n\n255\n00:12:44.661 --> 00:12:47.550\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well the styles make it easy.\n\n256\n00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:48.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they do.\n\n257\n00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.660\n&gt;&gt; It's just here's all the formats.\n\n258\n00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.180\nI don't have to think about it and\nthat's wonderful.\n\n259\n00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:56.785\nNow if I wanted to modify this like,\nall right let's take this and\n\n260\n00:12:56.785 --> 00:12:59.727\nremember it's over here to, all right.\n\n261\n00:12:59.727 --> 00:13:07.490\nI wanna make it to where this headings\nare bar green text instead of blue text.\n\n262\n00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:12.450\nRemember the idea about a style you\nchange the central style whereever\n\n263\n00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:14.630\nit's applied gets modified.\n\n264\n00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:16.978\nSo I'm going to come\nover here to cell styles.\n\n265\n00:13:16.978 --> 00:13:19.877\nAnd instead of clicking it,\nyou're gonna right click on it and\n\n266\n00:13:19.877 --> 00:13:20.870\nyou can go to modify.\n\n267\n00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:22.680\nSame thing we do in Word as well.\n\n268\n00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:26.346\nWhen I come into modify,\nhere's our dialogue box and\n\n269\n00:13:26.346 --> 00:13:31.653\nnotice that this particular style is\nincluding just the font and the border.\n\n270\n00:13:31.653 --> 00:13:33.779\nWell maybe I wanna have it center aligned.\n\n271\n00:13:33.779 --> 00:13:36.249\nMaybe I wanna have a number format.\n\n272\n00:13:36.249 --> 00:13:38.720\nIn this figure example maybe\nthe number format doesn't apply.\n\n273\n00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:39.470\nChange a fill.\n\n274\n00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:41.807\nI want to change\nthe background color of it.\n\n275\n00:13:41.807 --> 00:13:46.400\nYou do have to see like what items\nare checked off in this particular\n\n276\n00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.075\ndialogue box.\n\n277\n00:13:48.075 --> 00:13:51.035\nBut then to change it, you just go\nto format and this looks familiar.\n\n278\n00:13:51.035 --> 00:13:53.295\nThis is just a format cells dialog box.\n\n279\n00:13:53.295 --> 00:13:55.393\nOkay, so let's come over here to fill.\n\n280\n00:13:55.393 --> 00:13:57.551\nI will change it to grey.\n\n281\n00:13:57.551 --> 00:14:03.036\nAnd then I will make the font color,\nwe'll come over here to green.\n\n282\n00:14:03.036 --> 00:14:05.165\nAnd then we'll click OK here.\n\n283\n00:14:05.165 --> 00:14:10.290\nBut notice that it did choose right there,\nfill and it says shaded, it\n\n284\n00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:14.480\nnow knows that I went ahead and modified\nthat, so it's going to check that off.\n\n285\n00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:18.460\nBut always double check to make\nsure it's checked in here.\n\n286\n00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.750\nClick OK, and look at that,\nit changed all of them.\n\n287\n00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:25.150\nAnd if I come back over here,\nit changed it here as well.\n\n288\n00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:29.695\nSo that's the real power of\nstyles is changing it once and\n\n289\n00:14:29.695 --> 00:14:33.683\nhaving it radiate from everywhere,\nI love that.\n\n290\n00:14:33.683 --> 00:14:37.560\nOkay, so I'm gonna undo and\nwe will come back here.\n\n291\n00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.670\nNotice if I undo, it's actually\nnot changing the style [LAUGH].\n\n292\n00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:41.640\nCause why?\n\n293\n00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.050\nI went ahead and modified the style.\n\n294\n00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:47.890\nSo, we can come back over and if I need\nto I can go ahead and remove that but\n\n295\n00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:50.410\nyou can see the power of it there.\n\n296\n00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:52.994\nYou can also make your own style, okay.\n\n297\n00:14:52.994 --> 00:14:57.295\nAnd I'm gonna throw in a number format\ninto the just four right now even though\n\n298\n00:14:57.295 --> 00:15:00.490\nwe're not covering it in\nthis particular lesson.\n\n299\n00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:03.560\nI'm gonna throw this\ninto a monetary value.\n\n300\n00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.018\nI will make it bold and\n\n301\n00:15:05.018 --> 00:15:10.057\nI will make we should know let's go\nwith red we'll talk about Christmas.\n\n302\n00:15:10.057 --> 00:15:12.811\nI wanna make that as my style.\n\n303\n00:15:12.811 --> 00:15:16.890\nSo do all of your formatting and this\ncould be borders, shadings, everything.\n\n304\n00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:19.040\nYou come over here to cell styles.\n\n305\n00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.322\nYou make a new cell style.\n\n306\n00:15:21.322 --> 00:15:23.265\nIt's got all the stuff that I've chosen.\n\n307\n00:15:23.265 --> 00:15:29.159\nI will say, my style, let's pretend\nthat I know how to spell style.\n\n308\n00:15:29.159 --> 00:15:30.800\nYou click, OK.\n\n309\n00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:35.990\nAnd now, if I come like back over\nto here select all of these and\n\n310\n00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:39.980\nchoose that particular style,\nyou can see it eight there.\n\n311\n00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:43.640\nWell maybe red because red when we're\ntalking about numbers usually means in\n\n312\n00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.944\nthe negative doesn't it.\n\n313\n00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:45.875\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay so\n\n314\n00:15:45.875 --> 00:15:49.102\nmaybe I should go ahead and pick something\ndifferent but we know how we can modify.\n\n315\n00:15:49.102 --> 00:15:51.707\n&gt;&gt; What's going on in this\naccounting department here\n\n316\n00:15:51.707 --> 00:15:54.461\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah but you can see the ideas I\n\n317\n00:15:54.461 --> 00:15:58.932\ncan take my formattings, make my\nown style, and be able to apply it.\n\n318\n00:15:58.932 --> 00:16:03.164\nDo the same thing with the example we\ndid where, hey, let me go ahead, and\n\n319\n00:16:03.164 --> 00:16:07.140\nthen change that particular default\nstyle and we'll go from there.\n\n320\n00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:11.772\nNow, a few other things that I would like\nto show you is the themes that all of this\n\n321\n00:16:11.772 --> 00:16:12.755\nis attached to.\n\n322\n00:16:12.755 --> 00:16:16.090\nNow, I did go ahead and modify this.\n\n323\n00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:17.698\nYou know what, we're gonna take this, and\n\n324\n00:16:17.698 --> 00:16:20.235\nwe're gonna make it a Heading\n2 instead of a Heading 1.\n\n325\n00:16:20.235 --> 00:16:23.657\nBut this is based off of a Heading 1.\n\n326\n00:16:23.657 --> 00:16:24.572\nMm-hm, okay.\n\n327\n00:16:24.572 --> 00:16:25.996\nWell, you know what we'll do?\n\n328\n00:16:25.996 --> 00:16:31.787\nWe will take this, I will just modify\nthis and come back in to the Fill.\n\n329\n00:16:31.787 --> 00:16:37.113\nI will make no color, and I will change\nthe font back to that particular color,\n\n330\n00:16:37.113 --> 00:16:38.898\nwhich I think is that one.\n\n331\n00:16:38.898 --> 00:16:43.191\nOkay, now we are doing pretty good.\n\n332\n00:16:43.191 --> 00:16:45.230\nNow, we're kinda back to normal.\n\n333\n00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:47.320\nYou know what, that was Heading 1.\n\n334\n00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.488\nSorry, I'm correcting myself.\n\n335\n00:16:48.488 --> 00:16:54.475\nYou know what, pretend that's not\na [LAUGH] I need to change the font.\n\n336\n00:16:54.475 --> 00:16:57.117\nI could just close it and start over,\nand that would be even better.\n\n337\n00:16:57.117 --> 00:16:58.410\n&gt;&gt; I'll say, will it work?\n\n338\n00:16:58.410 --> 00:16:59.520\n&gt;&gt; That's what we're gonna do.\n\n339\n00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.430\nHey, you're fixing it on the fly.\n\n340\n00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:05.470\nSo let's come over here\nto format a worksheet and\n\n341\n00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:08.210\nbe back,\ncuz I really wanna show you the theme.\n\n342\n00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:10.150\nThere we go, look,\nit's like nothing every happened.\n\n343\n00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:16.030\n[LAUGH] So we've got our styles, and\nall of our colors are built off our theme.\n\n344\n00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:18.010\nYour themes are over here\nin your Page Layout tab.\n\n345\n00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:23.593\nIf I come over here to Themes,\na theme is comprised of your colors,\n\n346\n00:17:23.593 --> 00:17:26.350\nyour fonts, and your effects.\n\n347\n00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:30.350\nAnd that's the reason why I\nchose this particular shape and\n\n348\n00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:37.020\nI chose a pre-made theme on this one or\nstyle and well, in the graphical\n\n349\n00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:42.840\nelements in the advanced series, we talk\nabout adding our graphical elements.\n\n350\n00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:46.040\nIf I come over here to Themes,\nthere's a whole bunch of them and\n\n351\n00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.660\nthis is again, for\nall of your Office products.\n\n352\n00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:50.912\nIf I went over here and\nhovered, look at that.\n\n353\n00:17:50.912 --> 00:17:55.721\nDo you see how everything changed like\nthat, because I'm using styles in here.\n\n354\n00:17:55.721 --> 00:18:01.499\nSo it's pulling the galleries, colors,\nthe fonts, and if you watch that star,\n\n355\n00:18:01.499 --> 00:18:05.770\ndo you see how it kinda starts\nchanging like the drop shadow or\n\n356\n00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:08.950\nthat one has like a little pattern on it.\n\n357\n00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:11.213\nSo that's what it means by the effects,\n\n358\n00:18:11.213 --> 00:18:15.487\nthe default effects that will be applied\nto different graphical elements.\n\n359\n00:18:15.487 --> 00:18:18.860\nSo I kinda like this celestial one,\n\n360\n00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:23.250\nI do like a good purple and\nyellow right there.\n\n361\n00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:26.420\nIt's a little bit of Mardi Gras\ncolors going on there, so\n\n362\n00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:28.000\nyou can see that change of theme.\n\n363\n00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.600\nIt is document wide or\nworkbook wise I should say,\n\n364\n00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.740\nbecause if you come over\nhere to your sales.\n\n365\n00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:35.280\nAnd well,\n\n366\n00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:39.678\nit's not going to, that's because I chose\none that has basically the same font.\n\n367\n00:18:39.678 --> 00:18:42.791\nSo why don't we go to something\nreally different, there we go,\n\n368\n00:18:42.791 --> 00:18:43.723\nwe go to the Badge.\n\n369\n00:18:43.723 --> 00:18:47.415\nAnd now you can see that, well,\nit's not changing the Sales,\n\n370\n00:18:47.415 --> 00:18:49.683\ninteresting, well, that's okay.\n\n371\n00:18:49.683 --> 00:18:53.355\nBut it should go ahead and if I come\nover here to Sales and go over to Home,\n\n372\n00:18:53.355 --> 00:18:56.186\nlook at the, there we go,\nthere's the theme colors.\n\n373\n00:18:56.186 --> 00:19:00.135\nCuz I don't have any formats really going\non here, so that's why it's not changing.\n\n374\n00:19:00.135 --> 00:19:03.190\nAnd it is Gill Sans so\nthe font did change,\n\n375\n00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:05.170\nit's just looking kinda\nclose to the other one.\n\n376\n00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:08.405\nThat's why getting a little,\ngetting a little confused, so.\n\n377\n00:19:08.405 --> 00:19:12.677\nBut you can see the Themes we'll be able\nto change everything that is going on\n\n378\n00:19:12.677 --> 00:19:15.281\nin your document, whether it's the colors,\n\n379\n00:19:15.281 --> 00:19:19.055\nthe effects when you get into\nthe graphical elements, the fonts.\n\n380\n00:19:19.055 --> 00:19:23.376\nAnd you could go through and pick hey,\nhere are all the ones combined, but\n\n381\n00:19:23.376 --> 00:19:27.139\nI can choose my own colors,\nI can make my own colors down in here,\n\n382\n00:19:27.139 --> 00:19:29.531\nnotice I have one that's called Vonne.\n\n383\n00:19:29.531 --> 00:19:34.222\nSo, if you go over to Custom Colors,\nyou can choose which colors are in that\n\n384\n00:19:34.222 --> 00:19:39.063\nAccent 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6,\nwhich we saw in pretty much everything\n\n385\n00:19:39.063 --> 00:19:42.883\nwhen we're choosing the fonts and\nthe styles across there.\n\n386\n00:19:42.883 --> 00:19:46.494\nSo you can make them and\nmix and match colors, fonts,\n\n387\n00:19:46.494 --> 00:19:50.841\nand effects to have it to where\neverything that you want it to be.\n\n388\n00:19:50.841 --> 00:19:54.084\nNow, there's one thing that\nI mentioned that I feel\n\n389\n00:19:54.084 --> 00:19:58.665\nthat I can't really end the episode yet,\nDaniel until I tell everybody-\n\n390\n00:19:58.665 --> 00:19:59.441\n&gt;&gt; Well, thanks for watching everybody.\n\n391\n00:19:59.441 --> 00:20:01.638\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, no.\n\n392\n00:20:01.638 --> 00:20:02.977\n&gt;&gt; Wait there's more.\n\n393\n00:20:02.977 --> 00:20:04.780\n&gt;&gt; You're playing me up, aren't you?\n\n394\n00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:07.859\nYou're like, okay, we got to go\n[LAUGH] I told them about gradients.\n\n395\n00:20:07.859 --> 00:20:08.392\n&gt;&gt; You did.\n\n396\n00:20:08.392 --> 00:20:10.827\n&gt;&gt; I did, so\nI have to show you where they are.\n\n397\n00:20:10.827 --> 00:20:15.892\nI have my cell selected and\nif I come over here to the Fill Color, and\n\n398\n00:20:15.892 --> 00:20:21.150\nI go to More Colors, this is like,\nwell, there's nothing in here.\n\n399\n00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:22.620\nAnd this is like for any of our fonts.\n\n400\n00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:27.660\nI don't think I even got into this part,\nbecause with our fonts, with our text,\n\n401\n00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:32.390\nor our cell colors, I can go into\nMore Colors and get into the crayons or\n\n402\n00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:36.740\nI also can come into our Custom Colors and\nthen pick and choose which ones.\n\n403\n00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:41.470\nOr if you know your RGB values for\nyour particular company colors,\n\n404\n00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:44.210\nif you know that you can go ahead and\ntype that in.\n\n405\n00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:48.200\nSo these are the ways to\nfind solid colors, but\n\n406\n00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:52.010\nit doesn't say anything about gradients,\nand this is where you might just stop and\n\n407\n00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:55.570\nsay, well,\nyou can't do gradients in a cell in Excel.\n\n408\n00:20:55.570 --> 00:21:00.429\nYou can, though, you just have to go over\nto your Format Cells dialogue box, and\n\n409\n00:21:00.429 --> 00:21:03.295\nI did that by the dialogue\nbox launcher button.\n\n410\n00:21:03.295 --> 00:21:09.167\nAnd it's right there, here's our Fill,\nit's Fill Effects, yay, you can do it.\n\n411\n00:21:09.167 --> 00:21:13.804\nSo if you've seen it, this is where you\nget to it and then you can go into,\n\n412\n00:21:13.804 --> 00:21:18.462\npicking your colors, let's go from,\nthat doesn't look very pretty.\n\n413\n00:21:18.462 --> 00:21:22.568\nLet's go from a green to,\nwell, green to green.\n\n414\n00:21:22.568 --> 00:21:27.827\n[LAUGH] So we have a tealish color to\na more lime, that's not total lime green.\n\n415\n00:21:27.827 --> 00:21:28.523\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n416\n00:21:28.523 --> 00:21:31.525\n&gt;&gt; These are the colors on the screen\nthat I want to pick together [LAUGH].\n\n417\n00:21:31.525 --> 00:21:36.483\nAnd you can see that you can go into\ndifferent directions of your gradients,\n\n418\n00:21:36.483 --> 00:21:40.047\nand whatever this is looking\nlike here in your sample,\n\n419\n00:21:40.047 --> 00:21:43.380\nthat's what it will look like on the cell.\n\n420\n00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:47.500\nI think just a straight up\nhorizontal is fine, and we can pick\n\n421\n00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:52.480\nthe variants over here is like do\nyou want the Color 2 on top or\n\n422\n00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:57.550\ndo you want Color 1 on top, and\nthen you can click there, click here.\n\n423\n00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:03.197\nThere you go, yes, gradients in a cell\nin Excel, and now you know how to do it.\n\n424\n00:22:03.197 --> 00:22:07.374\nAnd how to format your worksheet,\nmake things really, really pretty,\n\n425\n00:22:07.374 --> 00:22:11.619\nspend hours on making it look nice when\nall your boss really wanted was just\n\n426\n00:22:11.619 --> 00:22:13.000\na really quick report.\n\n427\n00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:19.240\n[LAUGH] But, throw a style on it,\nlook at how pretty that is, done.\n\n428\n00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:23.033\n&gt;&gt; It's just a nice way to add just\na visual flair to your worksheets,\n\n429\n00:22:23.033 --> 00:22:26.438\nbecause that can be very monotonous,\ncan be very mundane.\n\n430\n00:22:26.438 --> 00:22:30.692\nAnd to add a little stylistic element\nto it can really lighten it up,\n\n431\n00:22:30.692 --> 00:22:34.873\nhelp people maybe not lose focus on\nwhat it is they're looking at or\n\n432\n00:22:34.873 --> 00:22:37.170\nyou can use it as differentiation.\n\n433\n00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:38.730\nI know this goes with this company,\n\n434\n00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:41.179\nbecause I'm using their\ncompany logo colors, right?\n\n435\n00:22:41.179 --> 00:22:44.960\nSo it can be very much that\nvisual que that you need.\n\n436\n00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.360\nSo a lot of different ways in which\nyou can use styles and themes,\n\n437\n00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.730\nand formatting of the cells,\ninside of your worksheets.\n\n438\n00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:53.800\nAnd Vonne, you've taken us down the little\nrabbit trail of how we do that.\n\n439\n00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.930\nWe do appreciate it, and we do thank you\ngood folks out there for watching, but\n\n440\n00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:57.910\nguess what?\n\n441\n00:22:57.910 --> 00:22:59.550\nWe are there, it is that time.\n\n442\n00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:00.975\nIt's so sad, it's so fleeting.\n\n443\n00:23:00.975 --> 00:23:02.588\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We have to leave, but\n\n444\n00:23:02.588 --> 00:23:03.720\nwe do appreciate you guys.\n\n445\n00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.910\nDefinitely join us back for more on\nOfficePro, here with our Excel Series,\n\n446\n00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:08.850\nthere's gonna be a lot more fun to come.\n\n447\n00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:10.860\n&gt;&gt; But it is that time for us to sign off,\n\n448\n00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:13.630\nfor OfficePro.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n449\n00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:14.874\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n450\n00:23:14.874 --> 00:23:21.840\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.952 --> 00:00:17.431\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and\n\n4\n00:00:17.431 --> 00:00:20.248\nwe're continuing on with our\nExcel 2016 Essential series.\n\n5\n00:00:20.248 --> 00:00:22.761\nAnd we're gonna be talking\nabout number formats, and\n\n6\n00:00:22.761 --> 00:00:26.164\nwe're just going to give you an overview,\na nice, brief introduction.\n\n7\n00:00:26.164 --> 00:00:29.206\nWell, when I say, we, I'm not actually\ngonna do much of the hard work.\n\n8\n00:00:29.206 --> 00:00:32.120\nWe have someone who's a way harder\nworker than I am Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.931\nHow you doing today, Vonne?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm doing fantastic.\n\n10\n00:00:33.931 --> 00:00:36.996\nHow are you, Justin?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I am doing fantastic as well.\n\n11\n00:00:36.996 --> 00:00:38.575\nNow, number formats.\n\n12\n00:00:38.575 --> 00:00:42.743\nIt seems like a pretty enough,\nyou're like yeah, I got you.\n\n13\n00:00:42.743 --> 00:00:46.777\nBut I'm guessing because we're here,\nit's a little more\n\n14\n00:00:46.777 --> 00:00:51.608\ninvolved than one would assume.\n&gt;&gt; That is, yes, [LAUGH] that is a yes for\n\n15\n00:00:51.608 --> 00:00:57.176\nsure, yeah, because this is a part that\ncan trip people up pretty frequently.\n\n16\n00:00:57.176 --> 00:01:01.732\nAnd it's really easy to kinda get a little\nbit confused about what's going on here.\n\n17\n00:01:01.732 --> 00:01:06.539\nSo in our other episodes we talked about\nformatting things like the font and\n\n18\n00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:09.913\nthe color and\nthe background color and the borders.\n\n19\n00:01:09.913 --> 00:01:12.452\nAnd so we're still gonna\nbe doing cell formatting.\n\n20\n00:01:12.452 --> 00:01:13.915\nWe're gonna format it.\n\n21\n00:01:13.915 --> 00:01:16.829\nBut we're gonna format\nspecifically our numbers.\n\n22\n00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:21.770\nAnd really what the cell content\nitself is associating itself with,\n\n23\n00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.359\nthe different categories\nof number formatting.\n\n24\n00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:27.865\nSo that's what we're gonna concentrate on,\n\n25\n00:01:27.865 --> 00:01:30.445\nwe actually have a little\nmini series going on.\n\n26\n00:01:30.445 --> 00:01:33.543\nWe're gonna have, the next four episodes\nare gonna be about number formats.\n\n27\n00:01:33.543 --> 00:01:36.304\nBecause well, they are that important, and\n\n28\n00:01:36.304 --> 00:01:39.219\nthere's a lot to talk\nabout in number formats.\n\n29\n00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:43.358\nSo that's what we're gonna concentrate on,\ngive you a nice little overview,\n\n30\n00:01:43.358 --> 00:01:44.344\nget our feet wet and\n\n31\n00:01:44.344 --> 00:01:47.829\nthen get into all the different\ncategories of the number formats.\n\n32\n00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:51.987\nI will go ahead and make a little\ndisclaimer here, if you are watching this\n\n33\n00:01:51.987 --> 00:01:56.231\nin succession you'll be like hmm,\nnot like my hair might look different.\n\n34\n00:01:56.231 --> 00:01:58.812\nYeah, that's because [LAUGH]\nI've actually come back and\n\n35\n00:01:58.812 --> 00:02:00.294\nwe're redoing these episodes.\n\n36\n00:02:00.294 --> 00:02:02.667\nBecause I wanted to talk more about it.\n\n37\n00:02:02.667 --> 00:02:04.652\nAnd it's been a little bit of time.\n\n38\n00:02:04.652 --> 00:02:08.151\nAnd actually we just finished\nup our Excel for Mac series and\n\n39\n00:02:08.151 --> 00:02:12.501\nkind of like the way I did number formats\nin that series little bit better.\n\n40\n00:02:12.501 --> 00:02:15.653\nSo guess what?\nI'm coming back to you PC people and\n\n41\n00:02:15.653 --> 00:02:18.647\ngiving you a nice little refresh of it.\n\n42\n00:02:18.647 --> 00:02:21.291\nYou don't know it's a refresh cuz you\ndon't know what the old one looks like\n\n43\n00:02:21.291 --> 00:02:22.253\neither, so that's okay.\n\n44\n00:02:22.253 --> 00:02:25.337\nBut I just wanted to throw that out\nthere because I'm a little bit on\n\n45\n00:02:25.337 --> 00:02:28.329\nthe continuity of like,\nthat person's hair looks different.\n\n46\n00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:29.544\nYeah, it does.\n\n47\n00:02:29.544 --> 00:02:31.707\nAnd we have a different host.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n48\n00:02:31.707 --> 00:02:33.641\n&gt;&gt; Than the previous episode too, so\n\n49\n00:02:33.641 --> 00:02:35.249\nwe've got our little team.\n\n50\n00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:38.739\nIt's kinda nice because we do\ncome from Excel and really,\n\n51\n00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.459\nnumbers in general from two\ndifferent backgrounds, right?\n\n52\n00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.043\nI'm more of a graphics person,\nI do use Excel a lot but\n\n53\n00:02:46.043 --> 00:02:48.591\nJustin, you're a numbers guy.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n54\n00:02:48.591 --> 00:02:51.499\nmy background was actually science,\nand engineering, and math.\n\n55\n00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:55.535\nAnd I used Excel when I was a physics\nmajor and then when I went to grad school,\n\n56\n00:02:55.535 --> 00:02:57.377\nI did a little bit of engineering.\n\n57\n00:02:57.377 --> 00:02:59.618\nExcel is great for collecting data.\n\n58\n00:02:59.618 --> 00:03:04.460\nBut I have different use cases for numbers\nthan you did or maybe even you did.\n\n59\n00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.391\nA lot of times I've seen people use\nExcel just for simple counting or\n\n60\n00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:08.430\nthings of that nature.\n\n61\n00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.415\nOr maybe even accounting sheets.\n\n62\n00:03:10.415 --> 00:03:13.295\nActually I have a little bit\nof experience there as well.\n\n63\n00:03:13.295 --> 00:03:15.953\nWe'll try not to talk about that as much.\n\n64\n00:03:15.953 --> 00:03:18.618\nBut there are a number formats\nthat I have used that by and\n\n65\n00:03:18.618 --> 00:03:20.333\nlarge a lot of people will have not.\n\n66\n00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:23.918\nBut hopefully we can provide\nsome alternative perspectives\n\n67\n00:03:23.918 --> 00:03:26.448\nthat will allow you to\nsee how useful number\n\n68\n00:03:26.448 --> 00:03:29.572\nformatting can be.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm glad you're here too because\n\n69\n00:03:29.572 --> 00:03:32.584\nI probably couldn't pass a fifth\ngrade math test anymore.\n\n70\n00:03:32.584 --> 00:03:34.921\nBut I got a math guy here.\n\n71\n00:03:34.921 --> 00:03:36.876\nSo he's gonna keep me honest\non some of this stuff.\n\n72\n00:03:36.876 --> 00:03:39.802\nSo we're gonna have a lot of\nfun with our number formats.\n\n73\n00:03:39.802 --> 00:03:43.961\nAnd why don't we go ahead and get our, go\nahead, let's get this party started, okay?\n\n74\n00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:45.695\nWhy don't we jump down into my computer?\n\n75\n00:03:45.695 --> 00:03:48.719\nI have a file that we were using\ncalled the Number Formats New, and\n\n76\n00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:51.856\nthis is the file that we are gonna\nbe using throughout this episode.\n\n77\n00:03:51.856 --> 00:03:54.251\nSo definitely follow along\nif you would like to.\n\n78\n00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:57.664\nAnd we've gotten some, well,\nsome numbers in here, right?\n\n79\n00:03:57.664 --> 00:04:01.689\nWe've got some content on our sheet\nI'll zoom in just a little bit, so\n\n80\n00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:03.066\nmaybe you can see this.\n\n81\n00:04:03.066 --> 00:04:08.315\nAnd the thing that I wanna kinda\nfirst talk about when we think about\n\n82\n00:04:08.315 --> 00:04:14.216\nnumber formats is that when we format,\nwe're trying to change the display\n\n83\n00:04:14.216 --> 00:04:19.391\nof that particular information,\nlike changing the font to red.\n\n84\n00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:22.541\nI want that to stand out a little bit\nmore, but in the borders around it and\n\n85\n00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:23.173\neverything.\n\n86\n00:04:23.173 --> 00:04:27.120\nSo this is how I would like it to\nbe displayed and formatted, well,\n\n87\n00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.171\nthe same thing goes with numbers.\n\n88\n00:04:29.171 --> 00:04:33.266\nAnd in these two columns that we\nhave here the ones in column B and\n\n89\n00:04:33.266 --> 00:04:38.134\nthen also in column D and on the same\nrows there's, I gave a little space for\n\n90\n00:04:38.134 --> 00:04:42.031\nthe column C, and then I'll,\nthese are the same numbers.\n\n91\n00:04:42.031 --> 00:04:45.166\nSo this number and\nthis number is the same.\n\n92\n00:04:45.166 --> 00:04:47.836\nYou're like, no it's not, that's a date.\n\n93\n00:04:47.836 --> 00:04:49.833\nActually, it is, okay?\n\n94\n00:04:49.833 --> 00:04:54.628\nFor example, this number 1.5689 dah,\ndah, dah, right?\n\n95\n00:04:54.628 --> 00:05:00.502\nThat's the same as this number if we're\napplying the rules of rounding, right?\n\n96\n00:05:00.502 --> 00:05:04.726\nIf I only wanted to show this to, like I\ndon't want any decimal places to show,\n\n97\n00:05:04.726 --> 00:05:06.587\nthen that would be the same thing.\n\n98\n00:05:06.587 --> 00:05:11.249\nThe other biggest thing to start\nnoticing about some of this stuff that\n\n99\n00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:15.914\nwe're gonna be talking about is while\nwe see this displayed this way,\n\n100\n00:05:15.914 --> 00:05:19.336\nas with all the decimal places and\nthis is just two.\n\n101\n00:05:19.336 --> 00:05:22.796\nIt is actually inputted\nthe same way as well.\n\n102\n00:05:22.796 --> 00:05:26.580\nAnother big concept to\nunderstand about the raw data.\n\n103\n00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.542\nWhat did I physically type into the cell,\n\n104\n00:05:30.542 --> 00:05:35.079\nversus how is it actually\nlooking on the sheet?\n\n105\n00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:39.258\nIt's the same one,\nyou just displayed differently.\n\n106\n00:05:39.258 --> 00:05:43.457\nUnderlying data versus\nthe paint we put on top of\n\n107\n00:05:43.457 --> 00:05:44.100\nit.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n108\n00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.619\nI think paint is very appropriate here.\n\n109\n00:05:46.619 --> 00:05:49.626\nIn my world this is like the view layer.\n\n110\n00:05:49.626 --> 00:05:51.356\nHow am I viewing this information?\n\n111\n00:05:51.356 --> 00:05:56.116\nI don't wanna alter the underlying data\nbecause I may change how much information\n\n112\n00:05:56.116 --> 00:05:59.231\nI have or maybe lose it,\ngain it, whatever it may be.\n\n113\n00:05:59.231 --> 00:06:03.875\nAnother way to think about it is\nthese formats, this display format.\n\n114\n00:06:03.875 --> 00:06:07.854\nIf you have a nickname,\nif someone calls you by that nickname,\n\n115\n00:06:07.854 --> 00:06:12.675\nyou're underlying, like if someone\ncalled me Big J or something, right?\n\n116\n00:06:12.675 --> 00:06:14.173\nI'm still Justin Dennison.\n\n117\n00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:17.750\nThat doesn't change the underlying person,\nit's just how I'm interacted with and\n\n118\n00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.732\nhow I'm viewed.\n&gt;&gt; Is that one of your nicknames,\n\n119\n00:06:19.732 --> 00:06:20.421\nJustin?\n&gt;&gt; No, but\n\n120\n00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:22.889\nwe can go with it from now on if you want.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n121\n00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:23.693\n&gt;&gt; Big J, hey,\n\n122\n00:06:23.693 --> 00:06:26.482\nlet's go.\n&gt;&gt; Is it, you said I'm gonna learn one of\n\n123\n00:06:26.482 --> 00:06:28.777\nJustin's nicknames, okay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n124\n00:06:28.777 --> 00:06:32.750\n&gt;&gt; So yeah I have quite a few myself, so\n\n125\n00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.629\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n126\n00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:36.743\n&gt;&gt; I have quite a few, so that's perfect.\n\n127\n00:06:36.743 --> 00:06:40.992\nAnd I'm really glad you kinda said it in\nthat way that we can kind of identify\n\n128\n00:06:40.992 --> 00:06:41.538\nit with.\n\n129\n00:06:41.538 --> 00:06:45.961\nAnd if we get back into Excel, the biggest\nthings you need to start looking at\n\n130\n00:06:45.961 --> 00:06:48.727\nwhen you're dealing with any of your data,\nand\n\n131\n00:06:48.727 --> 00:06:52.205\nespecially with these number\nformats is this area up here.\n\n132\n00:06:52.205 --> 00:06:54.821\nThis is our formula bar, okay?\n\n133\n00:06:54.821 --> 00:06:56.650\nAnd so when you look at this,\n\n134\n00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:01.011\nthis is a place that we can see what\nis actually written in that cell.\n\n135\n00:07:01.011 --> 00:07:03.662\nAnd while we see it here, oops,\nsorry, my mouse moved around.\n\n136\n00:07:03.662 --> 00:07:08.305\nRight there as 2 but\nlook up at the formula bar,\n\n137\n00:07:08.305 --> 00:07:11.796\nit says 1.568921, okay?\n\n138\n00:07:11.796 --> 00:07:13.119\nJust round it up.\n\n139\n00:07:13.119 --> 00:07:14.071\nSame thing here.\n\n140\n00:07:14.071 --> 00:07:18.798\nIf I look at this particular cell that\nI've selected, up in the formula bar it\n\n141\n00:07:18.798 --> 00:07:22.802\nsays 0.5 because we have decimals and\nwe also have fractions,\n\n142\n00:07:22.802 --> 00:07:27.049\ndifferent ways that we can go ahead\nas this 0.5 or is this one half?\n\n143\n00:07:27.049 --> 00:07:28.799\nSame thing, okay?\n\n144\n00:07:28.799 --> 00:07:33.306\nThat gets into a little bit of math and\neverything like that but\n\n145\n00:07:33.306 --> 00:07:38.168\nagain it does fall into the idea of\nthe display versus the raw data.\n\n146\n00:07:38.168 --> 00:07:41.837\nThis is a big one that always\ngets me in Excel, right?\n\n147\n00:07:41.837 --> 00:07:43.602\nPreceding zeros, all right?\n\n148\n00:07:43.602 --> 00:07:48.156\nYou type in 00 whatever, I should type\nit right here, I’ll type in 0012,\n\n149\n00:07:48.156 --> 00:07:49.691\nit does not keep the zeroes.\n\n150\n00:07:49.691 --> 00:07:51.142\nWhy?\n\n151\n00:07:51.142 --> 00:07:52.628\nThat's just Excel.\n\n152\n00:07:52.628 --> 00:07:53.946\nYou can't do it, okay?\n\n153\n00:07:53.946 --> 00:07:59.424\nWell, you can, if you start changing\nthe number formats of those cells.\n\n154\n00:07:59.424 --> 00:08:02.078\nSo, Kinda get the idea here.\n\n155\n00:08:02.078 --> 00:08:07.750\nHow do I know what number format is\napplied to that particular cell?\n\n156\n00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.910\nAnd each cell is different.\n\n157\n00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:11.391\nThis area right up here.\n\n158\n00:08:11.391 --> 00:08:13.569\nWe're on the Home tab of the ribbon.\n\n159\n00:08:13.569 --> 00:08:16.610\nAnd this area in the group, called Number.\n\n160\n00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:18.990\nAnd you look right where that drop down,\n\n161\n00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:24.550\nthat's gonna tell you what type of number\nformat you have on this right now.\n\n162\n00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:28.170\nAnd by default, if I started a file new,\n\n163\n00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:32.310\nif I just went to file new and\nhere's a brand new blank workbook.\n\n164\n00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:34.310\nAll of these cells\nare going to be general.\n\n165\n00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:39.436\nGeneral is the default number format for\nExcel.\n\n166\n00:08:39.436 --> 00:08:43.233\nOkay, let's go ahead and\nswitch back over to our other file.\n\n167\n00:08:43.233 --> 00:08:47.683\nBut if you start clicking on this\nparticular cell, then look up there,\n\n168\n00:08:47.683 --> 00:08:49.000\nit says Date.\n\n169\n00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.850\nIf I click on this one, it's Accounting.\n\n170\n00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:54.030\nI'm just gonna use my down arrow.\n\n171\n00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.730\nThis is Accounting somehow.\n\n172\n00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.842\nI'll check back that one in a minute,\n\n173\n00:08:58.842 --> 00:09:02.480\nbut notice this one says that this\nis a number and we keep on going.\n\n174\n00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.350\nThere's a Fraction, and this is Text.\n\n175\n00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:09.375\nText versus numbers is a big difference\nbecause when you start formatting\n\n176\n00:09:09.375 --> 00:09:13.560\nyourselves as text, then you can do things\nlike keep the preceding zeros, okay?\n\n177\n00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.630\nBig thing that I always do\nbecause I need those numbers.\n\n178\n00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:20.990\nGo ahead and format your cells as text,\nand it will stay with\n\n179\n00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:23.644\nthe zeros in front of it.\n&gt;&gt; And it's funny, because some people\n\n180\n00:09:23.644 --> 00:09:26.022\nwill go, well why doesn't it just\nkeep the zeros intentionally?\n\n181\n00:09:26.022 --> 00:09:30.170\nWell, for a number, all right, that\ngeneral is trying to be helpful to you.\n\n182\n00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.366\nFor a number,\npreceding zeros of a whole number,\n\n183\n00:09:32.366 --> 00:09:35.960\nthey don't actually add any information,\nthey're not significant.\n\n184\n00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:40.397\nIt will keep post decimal numbers or even\nnumbers on the right-hand side because\n\n185\n00:09:40.397 --> 00:09:43.410\nthose have different meanings\nin our number systems.\n\n186\n00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:47.300\nSo preceding zeroes, 00342,\nif that is actually a number and\n\n187\n00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:51.871\nnot just a physical representation,\nif I have 342 marbles in my hand even if I\n\n188\n00:09:51.871 --> 00:09:55.030\nsaid, there's two zeroes\nin front of that number.\n\n189\n00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:58.370\nGuess what, it doesn't change the fact\nthat I have 342 marbles in my hand.\n\n190\n00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:00.810\nSo it is strictly for formatting purposes.\n\n191\n00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:05.130\nIt is for a visual aide,\nor a visual kind of cue,\n\n192\n00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.150\na lot of times to help make sure\nthings line up in columns and\n\n193\n00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:10.280\nthings of that nature.\n&gt;&gt; Or\n\n194\n00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.050\nwhat if you're doing zip codes, okay?\n\n195\n00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:17.196\nOr you're doing item numbers that\nalways had, you have five numbers in\n\n196\n00:10:17.196 --> 00:10:23.905\nyour item code and some of them start with\n0025 or 00025, [LAUGH] gotta add those up.\n\n197\n00:10:23.905 --> 00:10:25.790\nSo those are things you need to look for.\n\n198\n00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:29.770\nAnd you need to know and\nunderstand, what am I storing?\n\n199\n00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:34.842\nWhy am I using Excel to store this data\nand how do I need to make sure that it\n\n200\n00:10:34.842 --> 00:10:40.359\nis displayed properly and stored properly\nwith the information that I need?\n\n201\n00:10:40.359 --> 00:10:44.530\nAnd so you can see this is formatted as\na percentage, this is formatted as text.\n\n202\n00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:45.200\nThat's a big one.\n\n203\n00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.522\nAnd this one over here,\nwhat's with those e's?\n\n204\n00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:49.870\nThat's scientific notation.\n\n205\n00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:51.090\nOkay, more on that.\n\n206\n00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:52.060\nAgain, we're going to go through and\n\n207\n00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:56.120\nexplain all of these number formats and\nshow examples on how to do it.\n\n208\n00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.510\nThis is just, again, for\nyou to understand, what do I need to know?\n\n209\n00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:02.960\nI need to know that every cell\ncan be formatted differently.\n\n210\n00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:08.410\nUnderlying or raw data is sometimes\ndifferent than how it's displayed.\n\n211\n00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:11.085\nThis is the place that\nI need to look at for\n\n212\n00:11:11.085 --> 00:11:14.721\nwhat type of number formatting\nthat I'm going to get.\n\n213\n00:11:14.721 --> 00:11:17.510\nAnd that drop down, so\nlet's just click on a blank cell.\n\n214\n00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.390\nI could format this.\n\n215\n00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:19.140\nI can drop this down.\n\n216\n00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:24.136\nThere are some ones that they have just\nready to go, the Currency, Accounting.\n\n217\n00:11:24.136 --> 00:11:29.460\nBut just like with anything, hey,\nI need to have some other options.\n\n218\n00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:32.150\nWell you go to the More Number Formats.\n\n219\n00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:35.839\nAnd the More Number Formats, this is just\ntaking us to a place we've already gone\n\n220\n00:11:35.839 --> 00:11:38.190\nbefore, some other places\nin the other episodes.\n\n221\n00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:41.382\nThis is the Format Cells dialogue box,\nright?\n\n222\n00:11:41.382 --> 00:11:44.525\nThis is the place where we went to for\nthe borders and the fill,\n\n223\n00:11:44.525 --> 00:11:46.956\nwe did the gradient fills and\nthings like that.\n\n224\n00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:51.220\nSo this dialog box,\nit's been around forever.\n\n225\n00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:54.410\nRemember I call it the old\nschool button sometimes.\n\n226\n00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:57.960\nSo if I get into the number format,\nthere are all these categories and\n\n227\n00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:02.050\nthen I have options within\neach one of these categories.\n\n228\n00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.150\nSo I can come in here to Fractions and\n\n229\n00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:08.800\nI have different ways like how\nmany pieces of the pie [LAUGH]\n\n230\n00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.100\ndo I want to go out to in how I'm\ngoing to be formatting our fractions?\n\n231\n00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.917\nOr how do I want my days to look like?\n\n232\n00:12:14.917 --> 00:12:16.960\nGosh, there's so\nmany different ways to do dates.\n\n233\n00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.790\nAnd Currency versus Accounting versus\nNumbers versus Decimal Places.\n\n234\n00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:21.840\nAll of that kind of stuff.\n\n235\n00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.360\nSo you need to go ahead and\nknow that there's more\n\n236\n00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:29.480\noptions in the Format Cells dialog box,\nwhich you can get to from that drop down.\n\n237\n00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.040\nYou can also right-click on a cell and\n\n238\n00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.980\ngo to Format Cells that's\ndown there in your menu.\n\n239\n00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:39.254\nAnd I believe it's Ctrl+1 is\nthe keyboard shortcut to get to that.\n\n240\n00:12:39.254 --> 00:12:42.660\nBut a whole bunch of different\nways to get to the same place.\n\n241\n00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:48.660\nAnd then also formatting after the fact,\nor formatting before the fact?\n\n242\n00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:53.780\nThat makes a big difference and this\nis one now I have colorized these cells\n\n243\n00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:59.060\nto indicate that this particular\ncell is formatted as a fraction.\n\n244\n00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:05.578\nBut if you aren’t paying attention and\nyou go ahead and type in 12.583.\n\n245\n00:13:05.578 --> 00:13:07.563\nAnd you go, what?\n\n246\n00:13:07.563 --> 00:13:10.290\n[LAUGH] I don't know why it did that.\n\n247\n00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:14.861\nOr, for example, here I type in 12345 and\n\n248\n00:13:14.861 --> 00:13:18.761\nthen I get it's Wednesday, 1933?\n\n249\n00:13:18.761 --> 00:13:21.067\nOctober 18th, that is, of 1933.\n\n250\n00:13:21.067 --> 00:13:22.010\nI have no idea why it's doing that.\n\n251\n00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:24.910\nBecause it's formatted that way.\n\n252\n00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:29.316\nBecause it was pre-formatted\nbefore you entered in information.\n\n253\n00:13:29.316 --> 00:13:33.932\nOr you can take something like this\nnumber right here and then go ahead and\n\n254\n00:13:33.932 --> 00:13:38.408\nchange it into, let's change it\ninto dollars, this is $0.71.\n\n255\n00:13:38.408 --> 00:13:40.026\nThat's one way that you can write it.\n\n256\n00:13:40.026 --> 00:13:43.947\nOkay, so then you go ahead and\ninput the information,\n\n257\n00:13:43.947 --> 00:13:47.210\nformat it after the fact or\nformat it before.\n\n258\n00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:49.256\nIt does make a difference sometimes.\n\n259\n00:13:49.256 --> 00:13:54.100\nOkay, and as we go through them,\nI'll demonstrate that.\n\n260\n00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.260\nOther things to know about\nwith this general format,\n\n261\n00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.690\nI'm just going to come up to here.\n\n262\n00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:04.027\nGeneral has some things that\ncan get a little weird, and\n\n263\n00:14:04.027 --> 00:14:08.271\nthis always makes me a little\nupset sometimes cuz, for\n\n264\n00:14:08.271 --> 00:14:12.902\nexample, the way that we do\nour numbering of our episodes.\n\n265\n00:14:12.902 --> 00:14:16.578\nLike if I typed in 3-1-01,\n\n266\n00:14:16.578 --> 00:14:20.790\nwe don't exactly number it that way.\n\n267\n00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:23.168\nBut say I do number things that way,\n\n268\n00:14:23.168 --> 00:14:26.903\nit's like no I don't want to be March 1st,\n2001.\n\n269\n00:14:26.903 --> 00:14:28.156\nI don't want that.\n\n270\n00:14:28.156 --> 00:14:31.535\nOr 2/2/2, okay, that's, no.\n\n271\n00:14:31.535 --> 00:14:34.430\nThat's not February 2nd, 2002.\n\n272\n00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:39.712\nThat's just what happens when you\ntype in numbers in a certain pattern\n\n273\n00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:44.910\ninto the cells in Excel and\nit's just gonna automatically help you.\n\n274\n00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:48.140\nAnd sometimes it's not always\nhelpful is it, Justin?\n\n275\n00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:49.208\n&gt;&gt; Yeah there are times,\n\n276\n00:14:49.208 --> 00:14:52.806\nExcel, editors I use, some other tools,\nthey're like let me help you,\n\n277\n00:14:52.806 --> 00:14:54.060\nyou actually meant this.\n\n278\n00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.960\nAnd I'm like no, I actually meant\nthis other thing so please stop.\n\n279\n00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.719\nAnd it can be incredibly frustrating.\n\n280\n00:14:59.719 --> 00:15:03.767\nBut one of the ways that we can curb that\nfrustration is be aware of the commonly\n\n281\n00:15:03.767 --> 00:15:07.460\naccepted patterns that this general\nformat's looking for, right?\n\n282\n00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:12.050\nSo slashes in the United States,\nwell, that might be a date, right?\n\n283\n00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:14.210\nAnd it's gonna make some assumptions for\nyou.\n\n284\n00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:17.020\nDashes, that might also be a date.\n\n285\n00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.100\nAnd I'm not gonna steal\nyour thunder Vonne,\n\n286\n00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:20.700\nI know you're gonna show\nus some other things.\n\n287\n00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:24.460\nBut we do need to be aware, if you're\nusing a pattern of text and you have\n\n288\n00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:29.930\ngeneral, it may kinda go, you actually\nmeant for this to be something else.\n\n289\n00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:36.490\nSo just keep that in mind,\ntake a deep breath, and just remember,\n\n290\n00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:40.590\nwe can change them and it'll be okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and knowing is half the battle.\n\n291\n00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:45.620\nIt's just like I don't understand,\nwell now you got a preview and\n\n292\n00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:48.170\nan introduction about,\nyes this is gonna happen.\n\n293\n00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:52.129\nThis is a big one for\nme cuz I used to work at a university.\n\n294\n00:15:52.129 --> 00:15:55.682\nAnd with universities and it's courses,\nyou know about this, Justin?\n\n295\n00:15:55.682 --> 00:15:56.878\nSection numbers, right?\n\n296\n00:15:56.878 --> 00:15:59.800\nAnd there are some combination\nof letters and numbers.\n\n297\n00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:04.342\nAnd it would always happen,\nevery semester,\n\n298\n00:16:04.342 --> 00:16:09.240\nthat we would have a section of one or\nthree E24.\n\n299\n00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:12.060\nThat was the section for\nwhatever course I was scheduling.\n\n300\n00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:17.622\nAnd then it does this, like no,\nI don't want it to do that,\n\n301\n00:16:17.622 --> 00:16:22.166\nbecause the E is representing\nas Exponent in Excel.\n\n302\n00:16:22.166 --> 00:16:24.246\nSo I was like, I can't.\n\n303\n00:16:24.246 --> 00:16:26.743\nAnd there's no way I could\ntry to change it back.\n\n304\n00:16:26.743 --> 00:16:29.760\nBut this is that whole before or\nafter of your formatting.\n\n305\n00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.680\nI couldn't format that back.\n\n306\n00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:36.590\nSo if I was storing sections in,\nlet's say, column I,\n\n307\n00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:41.580\nI would need to make sure that\nI formatted that whole column\n\n308\n00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:46.360\na lot of times to be text\nbefore I type anything in.\n\n309\n00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:50.680\nSo it would stop going ahead and\ndoing the scientific notation.\n\n310\n00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.197\nAnd, yes, trying to be helpful.\n\n311\n00:16:52.197 --> 00:16:56.699\nI love when programs are helpful until it\ndoesn't help me, and then it makes me mad.\n\n312\n00:16:56.699 --> 00:17:00.180\nAnd I pulled up a couple of websites that\nare in the episode notes that I just\n\n313\n00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:02.045\nwanted to kind of throw this out there.\n\n314\n00:17:02.045 --> 00:17:06.510\nIt's like you wanna stop automatically\nchanging numbers to dates, we said that.\n\n315\n00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:07.910\nAnd even though this\napplies to Excel 2003,\n\n316\n00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:10.050\nit doesn't really matter what version.\n\n317\n00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:11.091\nIt's just Excel in general.\n\n318\n00:17:11.091 --> 00:17:13.924\nBut I thought,\nI was like okay [SOUND], all right.\n\n319\n00:17:13.924 --> 00:17:16.768\nUnfortunately, and\nI'll highlight this and read it to you,\n\n320\n00:17:16.768 --> 00:17:18.964\nunfortunately there is\nno way to turn this off.\n\n321\n00:17:18.964 --> 00:17:20.991\nBut there is a way to get around it.\n\n322\n00:17:20.991 --> 00:17:24.445\nOkay, it says you need to make\nsure you format it as text.\n\n323\n00:17:24.445 --> 00:17:30.460\nOkay, so it's not gonna stop, it's not\nlike a check box in your preferences.\n\n324\n00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.050\nDoesn't let you do that.\n\n325\n00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:36.690\nAnd then there's some other things\ndown here of where it's like\n\n326\n00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:40.370\nwell if you type in an apostrophe\nbefore you type it in.\n\n327\n00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:42.962\nYou're using an apostrophe\ninstead of a space, or\n\n328\n00:17:42.962 --> 00:17:45.385\nyou could type a space\nbefore you type a number.\n\n329\n00:17:45.385 --> 00:17:49.876\nI don't know about you, I'm not gonna,\none, remember it, and, two,\n\n330\n00:17:49.876 --> 00:17:53.900\nit's just more things that\nI have to remember to do.\n\n331\n00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:56.570\nI just wanna type in the numbers,\nthat's all I wanna do.\n\n332\n00:17:56.570 --> 00:18:00.526\nSo that's something that I\npersonally just don't wanna go\n\n333\n00:18:00.526 --> 00:18:03.050\nthrough.\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna give a different\n\n334\n00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:04.310\nrecommendation.\n\n335\n00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:05.590\nIf you come from different backgrounds,\n\n336\n00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:08.530\nthe apostrophe is sometimes\nused to mean literal syntax.\n\n337\n00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:11.018\nI literally want this thing.\n\n338\n00:18:11.018 --> 00:18:13.950\nIf you're going to adopt either\none of those conventions,\n\n339\n00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:15.310\nI would do the apostrophe.\n\n340\n00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:18.827\nI think it actually recommends you do the\napostrophe internal to the documentation.\n\n341\n00:18:18.827 --> 00:18:23.373\nHere's why, hidden leading spaces,\nif they're not trimmed,\n\n342\n00:18:23.373 --> 00:18:27.503\nI can't tell you how many times\na hidden space character has\n\n343\n00:18:27.503 --> 00:18:32.110\ncaused me to pull my hair out and\njust go, I don't know.\n\n344\n00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:34.580\nIt should have taken 20 minutes, and\nthis is four and a half hours later.\n\n345\n00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:35.546\nAnd I don't know what's going on.\n\n346\n00:18:35.546 --> 00:18:39.497\nAnd then you find out there's a beginning\nspace or there's two beginning spaces,\n\n347\n00:18:39.497 --> 00:18:41.590\ncrazy shenanigans like that.\n\n348\n00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:44.270\nI like the apostrophe,\nbecause it's more explicit.\n\n349\n00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:48.510\nHowever, that's still typing,\nthat's still room for error.\n\n350\n00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:49.630\nBe very careful about that.\n\n351\n00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:53.030\nIt's probably just better\nto preformat to text and\n\n352\n00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:56.230\njust let it be.\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and the mentioning of\n\n353\n00:18:56.230 --> 00:19:01.900\nthe space, we have a whole series on mail\nmerge, and that will drive you crazy.\n\n354\n00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.523\nAnd you also mentioned something else\nthat I'd like to just kinda highlight,\n\n355\n00:19:04.523 --> 00:19:05.806\ncuz you made some really good points.\n\n356\n00:19:05.806 --> 00:19:11.144\nYou said something about trim, there is a\nfunction in Excel called trim where it'll\n\n357\n00:19:11.144 --> 00:19:16.195\nactually remove the hidden white spaces\nthat will drive you completely crazy.\n\n358\n00:19:16.195 --> 00:19:20.515\nSo those are definitely things that we\nwill talk about in the mail merge series\n\n359\n00:19:20.515 --> 00:19:24.215\nand in the function series\nwhere that particular thing is.\n\n360\n00:19:24.215 --> 00:19:26.570\nYeah, cuz it is hidden,\nyou don't really see it.\n\n361\n00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:28.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's still a character and\n\n362\n00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.250\nhere's a trick about trim is helpful.\n\n363\n00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:31.890\nI've done that.\n\n364\n00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:32.950\nI've programmatically done it.\n\n365\n00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:35.040\nI've done it in Excel and\nsome other languages, but\n\n366\n00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.430\nyou have to remember to do it.\n\n367\n00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:39.850\nIf you don't remember how to,\nyou're like it's fine, everything's good.\n\n368\n00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:42.955\nIf you forget, now you're back to\nthat four-hour extravaganza going,\n\n369\n00:19:42.955 --> 00:19:45.163\nI don't know why you don't work.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n370\n00:19:45.163 --> 00:19:47.681\n&gt;&gt; So I would probably just preformat,\n\n371\n00:19:47.681 --> 00:19:48.740\nleave it be.\n\n372\n00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:52.450\nThat way you have an explicit reminder\nat the top in the number format\n\n373\n00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:55.690\npart of your toolbar or the ribbon\nthat you can quickly glance at and\n\n374\n00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:58.736\ngo got it.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and I wasn't realizing that I\n\n375\n00:19:58.736 --> 00:20:02.303\nwas just showing that, and my virtual\nmachine just came back up, so that's okay.\n\n376\n00:20:02.303 --> 00:20:05.750\nThe other one that we talked about,\nyes, great points.\n\n377\n00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:11.130\nThe disabling scientific notation,\nyeah, guess what?\n\n378\n00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:13.360\nThis is a built-in behavior,\nyou can't control it.\n\n379\n00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:17.090\nOkay, and you just gonna have to again,\npreformat your cells.\n\n380\n00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:20.320\nI know I'm going to need\nto have the letter E and\n\n381\n00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.230\nsome combinations of numbers and\nletters for\n\n382\n00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:26.870\nthings like section numbers,\npart numbers, any of those things.\n\n383\n00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:29.760\nFormat your cells as texts and\nyou'll be good to go.\n\n384\n00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:34.330\nSo, and we will show you how to do\nall of that in our upcoming episodes.\n\n385\n00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:39.230\nOne last thing that I'd like\nto just throw out here, that\n\n386\n00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:44.880\nanother one that drives people crazy\nis this whole idea about clearing.\n\n387\n00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:50.278\nClearing your contents versus clearing\nyour formats, or clearing all, okay?\n\n388\n00:20:50.278 --> 00:20:53.413\nI think we've talked about this,\nbut I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n389\n00:20:53.413 --> 00:20:54.561\ntalk about it anyways.\n\n390\n00:20:54.561 --> 00:20:59.214\nSo if somebody comes along and\nthen selects this information and\n\n391\n00:20:59.214 --> 00:21:04.950\nthen just hits the Delete key or\nthe Backspace key on the keyboard.\n\n392\n00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:06.660\nSorry, I forgot, I'm in a virtual machine.\n\n393\n00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:08.790\nSo let's just go ahead and\ndo function delete.\n\n394\n00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:09.500\nThere we go.\n\n395\n00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:13.370\nOkay, I went ahead and\ndeleted that information out of there.\n\n396\n00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:16.710\nNow I have the bores on there,\nso that's one indication that\n\n397\n00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:21.720\njust hitting the Delete key on the\nkeyboard does not delete the formatting.\n\n398\n00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:26.357\nSo if I came in here, not talking okay,\nthat's great, or let's actually do this.\n\n399\n00:21:26.357 --> 00:21:28.748\nLet's do 1234, perfect.\n\n400\n00:21:28.748 --> 00:21:32.522\nYou come here, 1234, ooh,\nthat's not the same thing.\n\n401\n00:21:32.522 --> 00:21:36.060\n1234, that's not the same thing.\n\n402\n00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:39.870\nIt's just something that you need\nto be aware of is that we're\n\n403\n00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:43.045\nnot just talking about fonts and colors.\n\n404\n00:21:43.045 --> 00:21:46.000\nIt's the number formats, too.\n\n405\n00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.845\nSo if you really wanted to get\neverything gone, you would have to\n\n406\n00:21:50.845 --> 00:21:56.048\nmake sure that you clear, this is on\nthe Home tab on the Clear button,\n\n407\n00:21:56.048 --> 00:21:59.836\nyou're gonna clear all,\nget rid of everything.\n\n408\n00:21:59.836 --> 00:22:05.269\nThat will remove the contents and\nthe formats.\n\n409\n00:22:05.269 --> 00:22:10.197\nSo you don't have any lingering date\nformats, and that's why your numbers\n\n410\n00:22:10.197 --> 00:22:14.695\nare coming up in these weird 1930s\ndisplay and things like that.\n\n411\n00:22:14.695 --> 00:22:17.684\nSo just be very careful about that and\nknowing that.\n\n412\n00:22:17.684 --> 00:22:21.110\nAnd then sometimes you just\ndon't wanna delete the formats.\n\n413\n00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.738\nKeep everything.\n\n414\n00:22:21.738 --> 00:22:24.012\nIf I clear the formats, okay,\nthen there's my numbers.\n\n415\n00:22:24.012 --> 00:22:30.365\nOkay, so two separate things, contents,\nformats, and then of course get them all.\n\n416\n00:22:30.365 --> 00:22:33.797\nAnd then that will take away all\nthe lingering things within the cell,\n\n417\n00:22:33.797 --> 00:22:35.500\ncuz .that is what you're doing.\n\n418\n00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.342\nYou're formatting your cells.\n\n419\n00:22:37.342 --> 00:22:39.123\nYou're formatting your numbers.\n\n420\n00:22:39.123 --> 00:22:43.662\nSo that is everything that I wanted\nto talk about for our introduction.\n\n421\n00:22:43.662 --> 00:22:47.946\nAnd the next one, so I'm stealing a little\nbit of your thunder being the host.\n\n422\n00:22:47.946 --> 00:22:52.859\nBut we're gonna go ahead and move on to\njust some of our regular number formats\n\n423\n00:22:52.859 --> 00:22:55.969\nand talk all about ooh,\ndecimal and fractions.\n\n424\n00:22:55.969 --> 00:22:59.407\nAnd like I said, I'm glad you're here with\nme, Justin, cuz I need your math help.\n\n425\n00:22:59.407 --> 00:23:00.008\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne,\n\n426\n00:23:00.008 --> 00:23:02.749\nI'm pretty excited about providing\na little bit of math assistance.\n\n427\n00:23:02.749 --> 00:23:06.116\nBecause sometimes I'm not that great\nof an assistant when it comes to Excel.\n\n428\n00:23:06.116 --> 00:23:09.801\nAnd even though we call them regular or\ncommon formats in Excel,\n\n429\n00:23:09.801 --> 00:23:11.446\nyou may not be aware of them.\n\n430\n00:23:11.446 --> 00:23:16.108\nSo you should be coming on back as we\ncontinue in our Excel 2016 Essentials\n\n431\n00:23:16.108 --> 00:23:16.690\nseries.\n\n432\n00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:18.810\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap this one up.\n\n433\n00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:21.770\nSo signing off for Office Pro.TV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n434\n00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:22.620\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n435\n00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.110\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n436\n00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:27.976\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Ta-da [LAUGH] I couldn't help it.\n\n9\n00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.560\nI felt like I had to do a pose or\nsomething.\n\n10\n00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.105\n&gt;&gt; Yeah ta-da [LAUGH].\n\n11\n00:00:32.105 --> 00:00:34.012\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, yeah thank you so,\n\n12\n00:00:34.012 --> 00:00:39.051\nwe're continuing with number formats\nbecause this such an important topic,\n\n13\n00:00:39.051 --> 00:00:43.400\nto be able to display our numbers\nhow we want to have them show up.\n\n14\n00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.107\nWe've covered the number format,\nthe currency, and accounting, and\n\n15\n00:00:47.107 --> 00:00:48.636\nabout the negative numbers.\n\n16\n00:00:48.636 --> 00:00:51.605\nWe actually took a look at\nsome custom number formats.\n\n17\n00:00:51.605 --> 00:00:53.020\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yup.\n&gt;&gt; Preceding zeros,\n\n18\n00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.930\nwhich is just one of those\nthings that drives people crazy\n\n19\n00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:56.550\n&gt;&gt; Including me.\n\n20\n00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.080\nSo and we talked a little bit\nabout some default stuff so\n\n21\n00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.190\nwe're gonna come back into that and\nget into our date formats.\n\n22\n00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.010\nSo let's jump back down into this.\n\n23\n00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.420\nI've actually left my file exactly where I\nstopped it from where we were in part one.\n\n24\n00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.980\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n25\n00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.970\nI've made some little notes over here.\n\n26\n00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.510\nI'm gonna just move this over so\nyou guys can see this over here.\n\n27\n00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.280\nJust to kind of remind myself, let's\ntalk about dates, let's talk about time.\n\n28\n00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.520\nDates, so many different ways\nthat you can format dates.\n\n29\n00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.070\nAnd we talked about how that default\ndate formatting happens when we type in,\n\n30\n00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.978\nwhat was it, 3-3-3?\n\n31\n00:01:31.978 --> 00:01:32.820\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n32\n00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:40.176\n&gt;&gt; It automatically made it when\nI hit Enter into March 3rd, 2003.\n\n33\n00:01:40.176 --> 00:01:44.860\nSo that's something that\nit will always do, but\n\n34\n00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:51.612\nwe can have these have dashes,\nthey could have 03 versus 2003.\n\n35\n00:01:51.612 --> 00:01:53.350\nSo how many place holders,\nthere's so many different ways.\n\n36\n00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.780\nSo why don't we go ahead and\nexplore that a little bit.\n\n37\n00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.331\nWell take this date function,\nnot a function.\n\n38\n00:01:59.331 --> 00:02:01.390\n[LAUGH] This is a number format.\n\n39\n00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.300\nWell go into our no more, wow!\n\n40\n00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.117\nThat button right down at the bottom and\nin our date.\n\n41\n00:02:09.117 --> 00:02:13.690\nLook at all the different types we can do,\nyou can see that this is\n\n42\n00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.830\nthe number format and then if I come into,\nthe default date format.\n\n43\n00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.690\nDo I want to include the date.\n\n44\n00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.250\nThat's a cool, like it was Wednesday,\nwhen it was March 14th,\n\n45\n00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.430\nwell that's not [INAUDIBLE].\n\n46\n00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.310\nIt's Monday sorry I was looking at\nthe [LAUGH] the example not the sample.\n\n47\n00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.450\n&gt;&gt; The day of the week.\n\n48\n00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah the day of the week.\n\n49\n00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.599\nThank you, Monday March 3rd 2003.\n\n50\n00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.740\nThat's when it was, okay cool.\n\n51\n00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.360\nDo I just want to have the month and\nthe day.\n\n52\n00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.510\nDo I want the month, the day and the year,\nbut only with the two digits for\n\n53\n00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.980\nthe year and\nnot the four digits as you can see.\n\n54\n00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.080\nAnd then we have the different ways\nthat you usually see this more in like\n\n55\n00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.440\na European Settings I've\nnoticed where they put the day\n\n56\n00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.840\nthen the month, then the year.\n\n57\n00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.060\n&gt;&gt; Right they do it that way.\n\n58\n00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n59\n00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.720\nSo we always have to be different,\ndon't we?\n\n60\n00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.700\nMetrics what?\n\n61\n00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.198\n&gt;&gt; We're bloody Yanks.\n\n62\n00:03:03.198 --> 00:03:05.838\n&gt;&gt; We have to have our own way\nthat we calculate everything,\n\n63\n00:03:05.838 --> 00:03:10.622\nwhich is completely\n&gt;&gt; Not makes any sense.\n\n64\n00:03:10.622 --> 00:03:12.420\n&gt;&gt; Non European.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n65\n00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.050\nSo, we have all the different ways that\nwe have the different ways that we could\n\n66\n00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:23.138\nformat our dates, cause maybe I would\nlike it to say the March, there we go.\n\n67\n00:03:23.138 --> 00:03:26.030\nI was looking for this one.\n\n68\n00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.650\nMarch 3rd, 2003, or\nthe example March 14th, 2012.\n\n69\n00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:36.959\n&gt;&gt; So I want the month spelled out,\nand the day, comma, and then the year.\n\n70\n00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.059\nClick OK, and then, there you go.\n\n71\n00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.832\n&gt;&gt; It do it!\n\n72\n00:03:39.832 --> 00:03:43.340\n&gt;&gt; It totally does.\n\n73\n00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:49.120\nSo if I came here and\ntyped in, let's do a 7-3- 12.\n\n74\n00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.820\n&gt;&gt; 12.\n\n75\n00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:55.970\n&gt;&gt; But it didn't change it, but\nthat's because the formatting didn't,\n\n76\n00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.800\nI didn't tell this cell to be formatted,\nI just told this cell to be formatted.\n\n77\n00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.500\nSo that's where we're starting to get into\nthe preceding, because if you're going to\n\n78\n00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.180\nhave a table of information,\nlike if you're going to be calculating, or\n\n79\n00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.785\nnot calculating, storing information\ninto a spreadsheet, I'll get here.\n\n80\n00:04:13.785 --> 00:04:17.780\n[LAUGH] Is that you're\ngonna preformat the cells.\n\n81\n00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.190\nCuz I'm always gonna put that in there.\n\n82\n00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.040\n&gt;&gt; Vonne, can you format a whole column?\n\n83\n00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:21.670\n&gt;&gt; You totally can.\n\n84\n00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:22.390\n&gt;&gt; Ooh!\n\n85\n00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.030\n&gt;&gt; You know what?\n\n86\n00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.700\nWhy don't we jump on over there?\n\n87\n00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:30.400\nSo I have this as special and custom,\nbut let's do that whole idea.\n\n88\n00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.360\nMaybe we want right here, date.\n\n89\n00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.540\nOkay and I would like the date\nto be in that particular format.\n\n90\n00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.010\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So before I even type\n\n91\n00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.360\nany information into there,\njust go ahead and select the whole column.\n\n92\n00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.113\nIf I select all of column F by going up to\nthe column header and clicking it down or\n\n93\n00:04:45.113 --> 00:04:48.498\nclicking the button where\nthe down arrow is, I can say,\n\n94\n00:04:48.498 --> 00:04:52.891\nlet's go into the More Number Formats And\nI'm gonna come into date, and\n\n95\n00:04:52.891 --> 00:04:57.748\nI know that I would like it to be the\nspelled out month, yeah, that whole thing.\n\n96\n00:04:57.748 --> 00:04:58.879\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Click OK, and\n\n97\n00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:00.740\nit's not gonna look like anything.\n\n98\n00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.002\nBut as I come through here and\nstart typing, all right well,\n\n99\n00:05:05.002 --> 00:05:08.858\nit is February 2nd, 2013,\nso I just typed it in.\n\n100\n00:05:08.858 --> 00:05:10.891\nOops, I gotta make sure\nI have the dash okay,\n\n101\n00:05:10.891 --> 00:05:13.422\ncuz if I don't have the dash\nit doesn't recognized it.\n\n102\n00:05:13.422 --> 00:05:14.806\nAnd it automatically does that.\n\n103\n00:05:14.806 --> 00:05:15.509\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n104\n00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:17.335\n&gt;&gt; So that's where get it formatted.\n\n105\n00:05:17.335 --> 00:05:20.497\n&gt;&gt; You go, you go girl it's wonderful.\n\n106\n00:05:20.497 --> 00:05:25.829\n&gt;&gt; It's 10501 this is a good example.\n\n107\n00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.893\nThat is like a what?\n\n108\n00:05:28.893 --> 00:05:30.440\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n109\n00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.630\n&gt;&gt; Look at what it did?\n\n110\n00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.610\nIt says it's September 30th, 1928.\n\n111\n00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.354\nWhat?\n\n112\n00:05:38.354 --> 00:05:39.530\nI didn't put the dashes in there.\n\n113\n00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.230\nSo you need the dashes?\n\n114\n00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:46.819\n&gt;&gt; I need the dashes or\nthe slashes like if I did 1/1,\n\n115\n00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:52.802\nnotice right there,\nit says January 1st, 2001.\n\n116\n00:05:52.802 --> 00:05:54.100\nSo why did it do this?\n\n117\n00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:59.800\nAnd this is where you get into how\nExcel actually thinks of numbers.\n\n118\n00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.930\nIt doesn't really know\nthe calendar necessarily.\n\n119\n00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.320\nIt doesn't know what day it is.\n\n120\n00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.950\nIt does, but it's kinda\ncorrelated into a table to where\n\n121\n00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:12.150\n&gt;&gt; 1 or 0, there you go,\n\n122\n00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.740\nthat was the one I wanted to show.\n\n123\n00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:21.030\n0 is January 0, 1900, so if I typed in 1,\nthat's January 1st, 1900.\n\n124\n00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.450\n2, 3, getting the idea.\n\n125\n00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:28.120\nThere's a look up table basically\nto where it will say, all right,\n\n126\n00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.770\nwhatever I had typed in [LAUGH] is really\ncorrelating into September 30th of 1928.\n\n127\n00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:39.220\nIf I typed in 200, see,\nit's July 18th, 1900.\n\n128\n00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:45.600\nSo how many days it's been\nsince 1,900 basically.\n\n129\n00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.090\nCuz if I took all of these\ndates right here and\n\n130\n00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:49.500\nI said let's make them into numbers.\n\n131\n00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.830\nThat was what we did in the example file.\n\n132\n00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:56.980\nOr when we started of like\nthat's really March 3rd?\n\n133\n00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:01.850\nWell to Excel it is because there is\nthat correlating number to the date.\n\n134\n00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.170\nSo that's something to know is\nthat if you're pre-formatting,\n\n135\n00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:10.730\nyou do need to put it into however\nit's gonna recognize it as a date.\n\n136\n00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:15.720\nSo if I want it to be January 7th 2014 put\n\n137\n00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:20.960\nin the dashes or the slashes and\nthen it will recognize.\n\n138\n00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.050\nYou just put the straight numbers in,\nit's going to do that whole like that\n\n139\n00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.560\nnumber is correlating into this particular\ndate back in the day or what have you.\n\n140\n00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.838\nOr way in the future cuz\nit might be that way.\n\n141\n00:07:29.838 --> 00:07:34.950\nSo cool as long as you know,\ntype it in to you can get the information.\n\n142\n00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:35.950\n&gt;&gt; Dashes and slashes.\n\n143\n00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:37.280\nJust remember those.\n\n144\n00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.230\n&gt;&gt; Dashes and slashes.\n\n145\n00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.833\nI like that.\n\n146\n00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:43.510\n[LAUGH] So, it's the pre-formatting\nof our cells before we type it in.\n\n147\n00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:46.390\nThis is an example where we threw\nthe data in, which is awesome.\n\n148\n00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.867\nSo let's talk about,\nI wanna talk in a phone number.\n\n149\n00:07:48.867 --> 00:07:52.688\nWith phone numbers, you have the area\ncode, you have to put it in parentheses,\n\n150\n00:07:52.688 --> 00:07:55.440\nand then you have to put the three digits,\nthen the dash.\n\n151\n00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:00.410\nI don't wanna have to open\nthe parentheses, 352.\n\n152\n00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:02.913\n3331234.\n\n153\n00:08:02.913 --> 00:08:04.609\nThat's a lot of extra stuff.\n\n154\n00:08:04.609 --> 00:08:10.548\nWouldn't it be nice if I\njust type in 3523331234 and\n\n155\n00:08:10.548 --> 00:08:14.252\nit automatically put in the area code.\n\n156\n00:08:14.252 --> 00:08:15.374\n&gt;&gt; The dashes and the parentheses.\n\n157\n00:08:15.374 --> 00:08:16.824\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n158\n00:08:16.824 --> 00:08:18.212\nThere's custom formats.\n\n159\n00:08:18.212 --> 00:08:19.311\n&gt;&gt; I'll bet you there is.\n\n160\n00:08:19.311 --> 00:08:20.410\n&gt;&gt; There is!\n\n161\n00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:22.210\nLet's select the whole column.\n\n162\n00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.320\nWe'll come up into our drop down.\n\n163\n00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.056\nWe will go into our more number formats,\n\n164\n00:08:26.056 --> 00:08:29.033\nbecause there's nothing that says\nphone number in the drop-down.\n\n165\n00:08:29.033 --> 00:08:30.440\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n\n166\n00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.990\n&gt;&gt; We go to more number formats.\n\n167\n00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:36.620\nWe come into special and\nthen we go into phone number.\n\n168\n00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:37.410\n&gt;&gt; That's fantastic.\n\n169\n00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:39.920\n&gt;&gt; Watch what happens, tah dah.\n\n170\n00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:40.700\n&gt;&gt; It's magical.\n\n171\n00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:45.620\n&gt;&gt; It is, so\nnow I can just type in 8885551234,\n\n172\n00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:49.544\nI don't think that's an actual number.\n\n173\n00:08:49.544 --> 00:08:52.210\nBut look it,\nI even typed it in wrong, perfectly.\n\n174\n00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:53.955\n[LAUGH] It's my Uncle Bert's phone number.\n\n175\n00:08:53.955 --> 00:08:55.659\nHe'll be happy you called him.\n\n176\n00:08:55.659 --> 00:09:00.156\n&gt;&gt; You can see that I put too many\nnumbers and where did it put it into?\n\n177\n00:09:00.156 --> 00:09:05.763\nIt put it into the frontm if I just typed\nin 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or with an extra two.\n\n178\n00:09:05.763 --> 00:09:09.826\nIt's going from the back and\nthen formatting so\n\n179\n00:09:09.826 --> 00:09:14.304\nif I put in way too many\nnumbers puts in the area code.\n\n180\n00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:18.550\nDon't put enough,\nit just puts in whatever it sees.\n\n181\n00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:19.070\n&gt;&gt;

Let's say for example that our\ndepartments will always start\n\n206\n00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:31.356\noff with ITP- there will be\ntwo numbers that indicate\n\n207\n00:10:31.356 --> 00:10:36.663\nthat specific department,\nwe'll just say 2-2.\n\n208\n00:10:36.663 --> 00:10:41.260\nAnd then there'll be another dash,\nand then there'll be three digits.\n\n209\n00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:45.530\nThis is how all of our departments,\nthey will always start off with ITP-.\n\n210\n00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:46.695\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n211\n00:10:46.695 --> 00:10:49.177\n&gt;&gt; I don't want to have\nto keep typing in ITP-.\n\n212\n00:10:49.177 --> 00:10:50.805\n&gt;&gt; And there's your button for this.\n\n213\n00:10:50.805 --> 00:10:53.570\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is not really a button but, [LAUGH].\n\n214\n00:10:53.570 --> 00:11:01.220\nIt is in custom number format to where I\ncan say go ahead and put this and always.\n\n215\n00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:05.204\nSome numbers, another character and\nthen some more numbers.\n\n216\n00:11:05.204 --> 00:11:07.351\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So this could be, and now,\n\n217\n00:11:07.351 --> 00:11:11.010\nmaybe I wanted to say,\nSS number and then this.\n\n218\n00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:13.580\nSo you can uses an all sort\nof different correlations but\n\n219\n00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.125\nif there is something that repeats always.\n\n220\n00:11:16.125 --> 00:11:17.200\n&gt;&gt;

That's\n\n270\n00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:10.207\nawesome-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n271\n00:14:10.207 --> 00:14:14.830\nthese are things that if you're always\ninputting things the same way and\n\n272\n00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:19.093\nyou have to put in all of those\ncharacters and use your shift eight.\n\n273\n00:14:19.093 --> 00:14:20.870\nMake it a custom number format.\n\n274\n00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:23.480\nAnything you want constant,\nput it in a quotation.\n\n275\n00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.260\nIf you need zeros, put a zero.\n\n276\n00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.620\nIf you're never gonna\nhave a preceeding zero,\n\n277\n00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:30.630\nuse a number that it might just\nbe easier to do the zeroes.\n\n278\n00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:38.340\nBut one thing I would like to show you is\nthat if I had changed these to zeroes.\n\n279\n00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:43.383\nLike if I just typed in a 2008.\n\n280\n00:14:43.383 --> 00:14:48.646\nNotice that it does not put a 0 in front\nof that because remember the number,\n\n281\n00:14:48.646 --> 00:14:53.440\neven though I typed in nothing or\nit's just gonna keep it blank.\n\n282\n00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:56.770\nIf I use that as a zero,\nit would automatically put that in.\n\n283\n00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:58.450\nLet me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n284\n00:14:58.450 --> 00:14:59.300\nSo I'm gonna take this.\n\n285\n00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.173\nI'm gonna go to my custom\nnumber format again.\n\n286\n00:15:02.173 --> 00:15:07.870\nAnd in here, we're gonna change\nthese to zeros instead of numbers.\n\n287\n00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:09.280\nLet's click on okay.\n\n288\n00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.610\nYou see how it put the zero in there.\n\n289\n00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:15.330\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So even though I said six, one,\n\n290\n00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:18.600\ntwo, three- so I didn't put five,\nsix, one, two, three.\n\n291\n00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.180\nI didn't but five characters.\n\n292\n00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:24.230\nIt will always put that zero in front\nof it so it's that something where\n\n293\n00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:29.100\nit's always going to be that way that's\ntrying to show you when to use what,\n\n294\n00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:31.740\ncuz someone's like I always put\nzeros in there cuz I might need it.\n\n295\n00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:36.110\nIt will place it in there, even if\nyou didn't type that many characters.\n\n296\n00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:39.315\n&gt;&gt; So\neven after you've created your custom,\n\n297\n00:15:39.315 --> 00:15:44.050\nthe formula if you will,\nyou can modify it as you go along.\n\n298\n00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:44.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nYeah,\n\n299\n00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:47.380\njust like I could take\nall of these here and\n\n300\n00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.660\nI can take them from dates into numbers.\n\n301\n00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:51.480\nSo you can always change\nthe number format.\n\n302\n00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:55.400\nAnd then, in a custom one,\nit really is changing the format.\n\n303\n00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.520\nAnd so, I just modify it.\n\n304\n00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.020\n&gt;&gt; Modify it.\n\n305\n00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:58.520\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n306\n00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.129\nSo you can keep on going to see how you\n\n307\n00:16:00.129 --> 00:16:03.233\nneed it to be for those [INAUDIBLE] ones.\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n308\n00:16:03.233 --> 00:16:05.940\n&gt;&gt; But I love custom number formats.\n\n309\n00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.581\nI can think of all sorts of different\n\n310\n00:16:07.581 --> 00:16:09.499\nways that you could use that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n311\n00:16:09.499 --> 00:16:11.512\n&gt;&gt; I don't wanna have to keep typing in\n\n312\n00:16:11.512 --> 00:16:14.140\nthose extra characters, love that.\n\n313\n00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.190\nLet's keep on going through\na couple other examples.\n\n314\n00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:17.160\nThe section numbers.\n\n315\n00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.050\nThis is the one from part\none that I told you about,\n\n316\n00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:23.300\nwith the 2E87, where it kept\ndoing the scientific notation.\n\n317\n00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.750\nAnd I know that section numbers\ncould have the letter E.\n\n318\n00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.970\nThe E's always gonna make it\ninto that scientific notion,\n\n319\n00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:32.880\nso I don't want it to be that way.\n\n320\n00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:36.590\nThe easiest way that you can do this,\nand we did it in part one.\n\n321\n00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.460\nFormat it as Text.\n\n322\n00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:43.770\nIf it's Text, then it's gonna just\ntype it in exactly how you type in and\n\n323\n00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:44.790\nit won't change it.\n\n324\n00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:48.620\nAnd this could be the three dash three\ndash three that we don't want to have it\n\n325\n00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:53.030\nautomatically conforming into dates,\nmake it Text.\n\n326\n00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:56.531\nSo select this whole column,\nwe'll drop this down.\n\n327\n00:16:56.531 --> 00:17:01.480\nWe'll come into our Text and\nthat way everything is formatted there.\n\n328\n00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:07.670\nI can type in 3e12 and\nit won't do the scientific.\n\n329\n00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:09.260\nMy goodness, it was yeah.\n\n330\n00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.240\nI showed a couple people\nin the office this.\n\n331\n00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.952\nDo you know how long I've been\nwanting to make this do this?\n\n332\n00:17:13.952 --> 00:17:14.669\n&gt;&gt;

Right.\n&gt;&gt; If you need extra characters,\n\n384\n00:20:06.075 --> 00:20:07.630\nthose special characters.\n\n385\n00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:11.100\nThis is how I would say the easiest\nway is to do it, if I type in 98.\n\n386\n00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:14.250\nNow where do I go for a special character.\n\n387\n00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:20.060\nThis is just like in Word, you go over\ninto Insert and there is symbols.\n\n388\n00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.950\nNow notice I still have my flashing\ncursor in the place where I\n\n389\n00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:28.040\nwant to have that degree\nsign to be Inputted.\n\n390\n00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.060\nSo you come over to insert,\nyou go to symbol.\n\n391\n00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:35.030\nAnd then in here you now need to find that\n\n392\n00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:38.290\nparticular special character\nthat you want to insert.\n\n393\n00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.840\nThis is our font, normal text.\n\n394\n00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.219\nIf this goes in into windings or\n\n395\n00:20:44.219 --> 00:20:49.434\nsomething like that make sure you\njust kinda go back up into normal,\n\n396\n00:20:49.434 --> 00:20:55.214\ncuz that's gonna give you the blankest\n[LAUGH] character set, most blank.\n\n397\n00:20:55.214 --> 00:20:57.375\n[LAUGH] Yeah, okay, there we go.\n\n398\n00:20:57.375 --> 00:20:58.455\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And Vonne, let me clarify,\n\n399\n00:20:58.455 --> 00:21:00.395\nyou did say wingdings right?\n\n400\n00:21:00.395 --> 00:21:02.905\n&gt;&gt; Yes, well that would be another font.\n\n401\n00:21:02.905 --> 00:21:05.245\nWhere you create the little and\nthings like that.\n\n402\n00:21:05.245 --> 00:21:06.315\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, right.\n\n403\n00:21:06.315 --> 00:21:10.765\n&gt;&gt; So I need to find the degree sign,\nI think I already passed it.\n\n404\n00:21:10.765 --> 00:21:13.535\nI think it's a little bit further down.\n\n405\n00:21:13.535 --> 00:21:15.635\n&gt;&gt; I like wingdings it sounds like a-\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n406\n00:21:15.635 --> 00:21:18.820\nSo we have here- Where I have\nthis particular character.\n\n407\n00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:23.100\nThere is a degree sign, so\nI need to find that, and then I insert it.\n\n408\n00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:26.130\nI'm gonna move this dialogue box over so\nyou can see that when I insert it,\n\n409\n00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:29.780\nit actually puts it in to\nthat text place holder.\n\n410\n00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:31.950\nAnd sometimes people click insert,\ninsert, insert, and they close, and\n\n411\n00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:33.710\nthen they have like all these\ndifferent degree signs.\n\n412\n00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:34.460\nLike, it's doing it.\n\n413\n00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:37.592\nYou just probably have\nthe dialogue box that's hiding it.\n\n414\n00:21:37.592 --> 00:21:42.411\nSo at 98 degrees, so\nI want to be able to type in 102 cause\n\n415\n00:21:42.411 --> 00:21:46.684\nthat's how it always feels\nin Florida in the summer.\n\n416\n00:21:46.684 --> 00:21:54.100\n[LAUGH] so take this, select the text,\nand you can copy if you want to.\n\n417\n00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.200\nGo ahead and then click off of it.\n\n418\n00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.530\nI would then definitely copy it.\n\n419\n00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:00.010\nSorry let me go ahead and clarify that.\n\n420\n00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:04.740\nGo back over to home,\ncome back into more number formats.\n\n421\n00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:10.900\nCome into custom and in that type, get the\nword general out and then just paste this.\n\n422\n00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:14.280\nNow you do not want it to show 98 degrees.\n\n423\n00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:19.020\nBut at least you get that\ndegree symbol in there and\n\n424\n00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:23.060\nnow you just have to go ahead and\nput it into what could it be.\n\n425\n00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:27.480\nNow could it be zero, it could, right?\n\n426\n00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.930\nWhoops, that's not zero that\n\n427\n00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:34.420\nis zero degrees cause it could\nhave that registration on there.\n\n428\n00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:37.911\nI'm not putting in the number sign,\nif I click,\n\n429\n00:22:37.911 --> 00:22:41.758\nlet's scroll out a little bit and\nlet's click okay.\n\n430\n00:22:41.758 --> 00:22:47.610\nNow if I typed in 120,\nnotice it puts degrees.\n\n431\n00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:51.130\nBut I only put one zero in there.\n\n432\n00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:51.640\nThat's just so\n\n433\n00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.932\nif you ever typed in zero it would,\nwell it didn't recognize it for me.\n\n434\n00:22:54.932 --> 00:22:58.750\n[LAUGH] It's just that it's\ngonna recognize as a character.\n\n435\n00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:00.740\nSo if I typed in 34.\n\n436\n00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:01.310\nThat didn't work.\n\n437\n00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:04.460\nWhat didn't that work?\n\n438\n00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:07.580\nHold on, okay, I forgot to go ahead and\n\n439\n00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:11.010\ndo that formatting step but think\nthis is perfect, I'm glad I did this.\n\n440\n00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:11.630\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, right.\n\n441\n00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:15.250\n&gt;&gt; Didn't plan on it, but-\n&gt;&gt; A live debugging moment.\n\n442\n00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:18.660\n&gt;&gt; We need to make sure\nI have this same format\n\n443\n00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:21.390\n&gt;&gt; For all of these numbers.\n\n444\n00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:25.330\nI don't wanna copy the number,\nI just want the formatting.\n\n445\n00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:26.637\nRemember, the fill hand though.\n\n446\n00:23:26.637 --> 00:23:31.295\nThe fill hand, it's primary job is to\ncopy, we use this in the auto fill,\n\n447\n00:23:31.295 --> 00:23:33.100\nwe use it in flash fill.\n\n448\n00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:38.197\nIf I pull this down to let's just\nsay here for now, don't copy.\n\n449\n00:23:38.197 --> 00:23:42.106\nDon't copy Just fill in\nwith the formatting.\n\n450\n00:23:42.106 --> 00:23:44.890\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n&gt;&gt; Formatting only, there we go.\n\n451\n00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:46.760\nThat's why it wasn't working.\n\n452\n00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:52.360\nIt's now recognizing 0 as a registered\nvalue and it will display that.\n\n453\n00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:57.460\nIt is showing 34, but\nI didn't type in 000 because that\n\n454\n00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:03.168\nway if I typed in 34 it would do what,\n034, it would do 098.\n\n455\n00:24:03.168 --> 00:24:06.530\nDon't need that, so\nif you just do the one value.\n\n456\n00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:08.921\nYou can type that in.\n\n457\n00:24:08.921 --> 00:24:13.095\nI'm using my rounding because if\nthat's where I need it to go ahead and\n\n458\n00:24:13.095 --> 00:24:17.595\nget the decimal places to show more and\nit didn't do that but that's okay.\n\n459\n00:24:17.595 --> 00:24:21.600\n[LAUGH] I can go ahead and allow it\nto do that, but maybe this is where\n\n460\n00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:26.320\nsometimes maybe the number format doesn't\nalways work with every single value.\n\n461\n00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.320\nYou gotta be a little careful with some\nof these custom number formats, and\n\n462\n00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:34.222\nthink about what your data needs to be and\nhow to be displayed.\n\n463\n00:24:34.222 --> 00:24:37.430\nSo, it's very handy.\n\n464\n00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:41.750\nBut like with this example where I\nsaid I needed to be 12.6 degrees,\n\n465\n00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:46.150\nthis is where maybe you just go ahead and\nforego the degrees sign.\n\n466\n00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:51.130\nYou know that this column is\ngoing to be the temperature and\n\n467\n00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:53.320\nso, I don't need the symbol.\n\n468\n00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:54.840\nI need the decimal places.\n\n469\n00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.770\nThat's more important.\n\n470\n00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:58.620\nThat's where you could say,\nall right, let's go ahead and\n\n471\n00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:00.650\nchange this back to numbers.\n\n472\n00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:08.280\nI will be able to use those decimal\nplaces because I need it to be 21.6.\n\n473\n00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:12.180\nAnd so on and so forth, so\nyou need to just determine what is more\n\n474\n00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:15.920\nimportant to you and that's why\ncolumn headings are really great.\n\n475\n00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:16.545\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n476\n00:25:16.545 --> 00:25:17.105\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] [INAUDIBLE] symbols.\n\n477\n00:25:17.105 --> 00:25:20.960\n&gt;&gt; So I think that about covers\neverything that I want to.\n\n478\n00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.140\nYou know what?\n\n479\n00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:23.130\nSorry, one more.\n\n480\n00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:24.000\nOkay.\n\n481\n00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.310\nDate and time.\n\n482\n00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:28.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Date and time can be really,\n\n483\n00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.010\nreally all over the place.\n\n484\n00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:34.320\nI do have a website that\ngives you a little bit more\n\n485\n00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:39.500\ninformation about how to display dates and\n\n486\n00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:43.920\ntimes and\nwhat all of these different symbols mean.\n\n487\n00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:48.060\nLike see right here, like the m's and\nthe d's and the Hs and\n\n488\n00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:51.790\nthe Y for your hours and minutes.\n\n489\n00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:56.350\nTime can be one of those things where like\nyou have to type in like the AM and PM.\n\n490\n00:25:56.350 --> 00:26:01.574\nRemember because the number\nformat like if you always want\n\n491\n00:26:01.574 --> 00:26:07.570\nit to be especially during military time,\n23:24.\n\n492\n00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:11.230\nThat is a time.\n\n493\n00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:12.980\nYou can make it custom number format.\n\n494\n00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:19.230\nYou can do 00, open the quote, colon,\nclose the quote, and then two more zero's.\n\n495\n00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:24.535\nSo that way, you can do 0300 hours,\nor 0330, or those types of things.\n\n496\n00:26:24.535 --> 00:26:27.380\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So you can make your own number format.\n\n497\n00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:31.210\nBut if you're using AM's and\nPM's you will have type that in and\n\n498\n00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:35.160\nthat can get a little like\nalright I have to go with it.\n\n499\n00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:39.050\nBut this give you a little bit more\ninformation on how you can do that.\n\n500\n00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:42.000\nYou can always make a separate column for\nAM and PM.\n\n501\n00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.760\nLike just go ahead then you can't need it,\nthere's all sorts of different ways you\n\n502\n00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:49.930\ncan do it, but, again, you have to\nknow what you need your data to show.\n\n503\n00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:54.360\nConcatenate, by the way, is a function or\na formula that would, then, take this and\n\n504\n00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:55.260\nthis and bring it together.\n\n505\n00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:57.210\nOr you can do that cool flashville.\n\n506\n00:26:57.210 --> 00:27:00.170\nCheck out the series, or\nthe episode on flashville cuz that was-\n\n507\n00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:00.900\n&gt;&gt;

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.164 --> 00:00:18.691\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and it\nlooks like you've made it back in time in\n\n4\n00:00:18.691 --> 00:00:22.495\norder to see our Excel 2016 Essential\nseries and, well, we're talking about\n\n5\n00:00:22.495 --> 00:00:25.950\na number of formats, particularly\nwe're talking about dates and times.\n\n6\n00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.322\nIf you haven't watched\nthe previous episode,\n\n7\n00:00:28.322 --> 00:00:31.117\ngo see the nice little\nforeshadowing that I left there.\n\n8\n00:00:31.117 --> 00:00:35.812\nAnd, well, luckily we have someone who can\nbend space-time with her will to tell us\n\n9\n00:00:35.812 --> 00:00:37.677\nall about them, Ms Vonne Smith.\n\n10\n00:00:37.677 --> 00:00:39.979\nHow are you doing today, Vonne?\n&gt;&gt; Well, I didn't know I had that special\n\n11\n00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:42.170\npower [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; I might have over-promised on that one\n\n12\n00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.345\na little bit but\nwe'll go with it this time, right?\n\n13\n00:00:44.345 --> 00:00:47.025\nSo dates and times,\nit seems pretty simple but\n\n14\n00:00:47.025 --> 00:00:51.358\nI know from my experience they're not\nalways as simple as they first appear\n\n15\n00:00:51.358 --> 00:00:53.480\nto be.\n&gt;&gt; No, they are not.\n\n16\n00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.795\n&gt;&gt; And there's so\n\n17\n00:00:54.795 --> 00:01:00.369\nmany different ways to do dates,\nit's kinda scary a little bit.\n\n18\n00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:04.382\nAnd then you go down the rabbit hole of\nall the different ways of going ahead and\n\n19\n00:01:04.382 --> 00:01:05.444\ndisplaying dates.\n\n20\n00:01:05.444 --> 00:01:10.040\nIt can be a little scary, so\nI'd like to start there actually with\n\n21\n00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.570\na little bit of trivial knowledge or\nI don't know about trivia.\n\n22\n00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.475\nBut let's go to the computer and\nsee what we got down in here,\n\n23\n00:01:17.475 --> 00:01:22.730\nI've got a couple of websites\npulled up and, of course, you\n\n24\n00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.260\ncan't not go to Wikipedia, I think that's\na double negative somewhere in there.\n\n25\n00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.052\nI think it is.\n&gt;&gt; But I think it's allowed if you can't\n\n26\n00:01:29.052 --> 00:01:31.412\nnot do something, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n27\n00:01:31.412 --> 00:01:34.842\n&gt;&gt; I think that's an acceptable double\n\n28\n00:01:34.842 --> 00:01:38.193\nnegative in that context.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I buy it.\n\n29\n00:01:38.193 --> 00:01:40.105\n&gt;&gt; It's not like I'm saying,\n\n30\n00:01:40.105 --> 00:01:43.697\nI'm not hardly hoping not to or\nsomething like that.\n\n31\n00:01:43.697 --> 00:01:47.010\n[LAUGH] It's not something like that,\nI can't not go to, so.\n\n32\n00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.380\n&gt;&gt; Good, I like it and I use it a lot.\n\n33\n00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.900\nSo yes, we have date and\ntime notation in the United States.\n\n34\n00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.130\nAnd we're pretty much different from\nany other English speaking country.\n\n35\n00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.401\nIt's like we're just different,\nwe always need to be, just because.\n\n36\n00:02:03.401 --> 00:02:08.228\nAnd you could see that if I was\ngoing to say, what is today, Justin,\n\n37\n00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:12.476\nwhat would you say?\n&gt;&gt; I would say 3/14/18 or\n\n38\n00:02:12.476 --> 00:02:18.408\n3/14/2018 or\nsometimes I have seen padded with 0s.\n\n39\n00:02:18.408 --> 00:02:23.716\nI tend to go with the less\nambiguous approach like four years.\n\n40\n00:02:23.716 --> 00:02:26.593\nBut that's based on my background and\nthings that I've done.\n\n41\n00:02:26.593 --> 00:02:29.054\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and if it's March 14,\n\n42\n00:02:29.054 --> 00:02:34.477\n2018 we say the month,\nthen the day, then the year, right?\n\n43\n00:02:34.477 --> 00:02:40.576\nBut we could say it's the 14th\nof March in the year of 2018.\n\n44\n00:02:40.576 --> 00:02:42.490\nThat's totally valid, too.\n\n45\n00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.670\nWe usually use a 12 hour clock notation.\n\n46\n00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.895\nThe military time which I have to\nsit there and add on my fingers or\n\n47\n00:02:51.895 --> 00:02:55.801\nsubtract every time cuz it's just\na little, they're like, it's so easy.\n\n48\n00:02:55.801 --> 00:02:59.336\nI'm like yeah,\nif you get used to it and that's fine.\n\n49\n00:02:59.336 --> 00:03:03.143\nBut there's just different\nways that you can go ahead and\n\n50\n00:03:03.143 --> 00:03:07.189\ndesignate the years and\nall about whether there's a slash,\n\n51\n00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:11.567\nis there a hyphen, is there a period,\nwhich one is it going to be?\n\n52\n00:03:11.567 --> 00:03:16.143\nAnd then it also talks about that we do,\nusually spoken with\n\n53\n00:03:16.143 --> 00:03:20.914\nthe year as a cardinal number and\nthe day as an ordinal number.\n\n54\n00:03:20.914 --> 00:03:24.229\nSo do you know the difference\nbetween cardinal and ordinal,\n\n55\n00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:26.808\nJustin?\n&gt;&gt; Ordinal is for ordering,\n\n56\n00:03:26.808 --> 00:03:32.046\nlike the first, the second, the third and\ncardinal is how we typically say numbers.\n\n57\n00:03:32.046 --> 00:03:35.496\nLike, that's 2009 or whatever it may be.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n58\n00:03:35.496 --> 00:03:37.730\nI think they say here, quantity.\n\n59\n00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:38.267\nYes.\nAnd\n\n60\n00:03:38.267 --> 00:03:42.050\nI think it's ordinals that\nare actually something within fonts,\n\n61\n00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.250\nlike in font sets and\nhow it's actually represented,\n\n62\n00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.990\nhow they do the superscript of those\nparticular characters, it's kind of fun.\n\n63\n00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.152\nAnd I love to talk about it,\n\n64\n00:03:52.152 --> 00:03:56.630\nyeah, cuz you have things in your\nfont sets like swashes and ordinals.\n\n65\n00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.850\nAnd people will go what?\n\n66\n00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:59.950\nAnd I'm like it's fun.\n\n67\n00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:00.895\nAnd glyphs?\n\n68\n00:04:00.895 --> 00:04:02.043\nGotta love a glyph.\n\n69\n00:04:02.043 --> 00:04:04.915\nSo anyways,\nwe've got those different things and\n\n70\n00:04:04.915 --> 00:04:08.853\nI do think it was kinda fun to talk\nabout all the different countries and\n\n71\n00:04:08.853 --> 00:04:13.258\nwhat type of things and then how we're\nright over here in the big old fuchsia but\n\n72\n00:04:13.258 --> 00:04:15.966\nCanada is hanging out there by itself too,\nso.\n\n73\n00:04:15.966 --> 00:04:20.217\nJust a little bit of fun, poking fun\nat ourselves like we just have to do\n\n74\n00:04:20.217 --> 00:04:23.185\neverything just a little bit different,\nokay?\n\n75\n00:04:23.185 --> 00:04:29.076\nSo you're gonna have to pick what do you\nwant your dates to look like in Excel and\n\n76\n00:04:29.076 --> 00:04:31.890\nthen we can format accordingly.\n\n77\n00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.320\nOkay, so\nwhy don't we come down into Excel?\n\n78\n00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.900\nWe have talked about\nthe general number format.\n\n79\n00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.836\nAnd let me go over here to my Home tab so\n\n80\n00:04:41.836 --> 00:04:44.158\nI can bring back up\nthe number formats here.\n\n81\n00:04:44.158 --> 00:04:49.366\nIf I type in 12345,\njust a regular number but\n\n82\n00:04:49.366 --> 00:04:56.066\nif I type in 3-14-18,\nit will turn itself into a number.\n\n83\n00:04:56.066 --> 00:05:00.952\nThe 2/2/2, February 2nd,\nall those different things,\n\n84\n00:05:00.952 --> 00:05:06.980\nit's gonna automatically going back\nup this cell, flip it into a date.\n\n85\n00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.710\nAnd it does format the same way,\ndoesn't it?\n\n86\n00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:18.490\nAgain, if I typed in 12-12-12, notice\nit does turn it into a four-digit year.\n\n87\n00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.877\nBut you can have a digit year as well and\n\n88\n00:05:21.877 --> 00:05:25.426\nyou could have it to where\nthe zero is in front of the three,\n\n89\n00:05:25.426 --> 00:05:30.081\na zero in front of the two, there's\ndifferent ways to go ahead and write it.\n\n90\n00:05:30.081 --> 00:05:37.999\nOkay, so down here, notice that I have\nalready formatted in the day, month, year.\n\n91\n00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:39.369\nThat's different isn't it?\n\n92\n00:05:39.369 --> 00:05:44.511\nSo if I typed in 3-14-18,\n\n93\n00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:48.007\nwell, it flipped it.\n\n94\n00:05:48.007 --> 00:05:51.143\nIt's actually the 14th of March,\n\n95\n00:05:51.143 --> 00:05:55.708\n2018 because it's already\nformatted that way.\n\n96\n00:05:55.708 --> 00:06:00.899\nSo if I typed in, let's say, 12-2-18.\n\n97\n00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:05.350\nOkay, well then, I was actually\n\n98\n00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:12.300\ntrying to do the 12th day of February.\n\n99\n00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.837\nBut what did it do?\n\n100\n00:06:13.837 --> 00:06:14.857\nIt flipped it.\n\n101\n00:06:14.857 --> 00:06:18.040\nThat could be confusing, too.\n\n102\n00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.730\nYou gotta be careful on these, all right?\n\n103\n00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.650\nEspecially since there's a whole\nset of numbers between 1 and\n\n104\n00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.770\n12 that could represent both the day and\nthe month.\n\n105\n00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.644\nWhich one is which?\n&gt;&gt; Now does this same flipping apply if we\n\n106\n00:06:31.644 --> 00:06:34.305\nuse slashes when we're typing\nin here instead of dashes?\n\n107\n00:06:34.305 --> 00:06:42.328\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so I was trying to do 2/12/18.\n\n108\n00:06:42.328 --> 00:06:45.372\nLook at that.\n\n109\n00:06:45.372 --> 00:06:51.526\nOkay so 2-12-18, okay, did I flip it?\n\n110\n00:06:51.526 --> 00:06:54.739\nI was trying to do the-\n&gt;&gt; You must have flipped it originally,\n\n111\n00:06:54.739 --> 00:06:56.691\nyou must've done 12-2.\n\n112\n00:06:56.691 --> 00:07:01.556\nBut that actually illustrates a point,\nright?\n\n113\n00:07:01.556 --> 00:07:03.967\nThat illustrates a point\nthat wait a minute,\n\n114\n00:07:03.967 --> 00:07:06.443\nI'm trying to noodle these\naround in my head so\n\n115\n00:07:06.443 --> 00:07:10.640\nas I'm typing them that they automatically\nget flipped and formatted for me.\n\n116\n00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.840\nIt can be problematic because of,\nwell, we're Tulsans, we're young.\n\n117\n00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.900\nYou write the date these ways.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n118\n00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.100\n&gt;&gt; And you write the time these ways and\n\n119\n00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.680\nthen if you have to reformat them,\n\n120\n00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.125\nit takes a little bit of\ncognitive complexity.\n\n121\n00:07:24.125 --> 00:07:25.990\nI'll have a question about this.\n\n122\n00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.610\nCan I do decimals?\n\n123\n00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:32.115\nCuz I've actually seen and I think\nthe Wikipedia article actually says this,\n\n124\n00:07:32.115 --> 00:07:36.990\n1.1.18.\n&gt;&gt; Let's try it, let's select these.\n\n125\n00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:40.964\nTalk about cognitive complexity, you can\nsee I don't have much because I can't even\n\n126\n00:07:40.964 --> 00:07:42.794\nremember what I was trying to type in.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n127\n00:07:42.794 --> 00:07:43.815\n&gt;&gt; But it's all right,\n\n128\n00:07:43.815 --> 00:07:47.796\nI've got myself already in a loop of like,\nwait am I in December, am I in February.\n\n129\n00:07:47.796 --> 00:07:48.807\nWhat did I type in?\n\n130\n00:07:48.807 --> 00:07:50.028\nHow am I supposed to do that?\n\n131\n00:07:50.028 --> 00:07:56.360\nSo you said 1.1.18.\n&gt;&gt; 18.\n\n132\n00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.010\n&gt;&gt; Now it just looks like it says I don't\n\n133\n00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:58.868\nunderstand that.\n\n134\n00:07:58.868 --> 00:08:03.521\nSo the dot is not like\na representative of the pattern,\n\n135\n00:08:03.521 --> 00:08:07.752\nIt's going to recognize the dates.\n&gt;&gt; Which is odd because\n\n136\n00:08:07.752 --> 00:08:11.824\nin the United States there are times\nwhere dates are represented with dots as\n\n137\n00:08:11.824 --> 00:08:15.535\nthe dilimiting character,\nit only recognizes slashes and dashes.\n\n138\n00:08:15.535 --> 00:08:18.755\nThere's probably a couple of other\nones there, but if you're within\n\n139\n00:08:18.755 --> 00:08:22.565\nthe United States and you're like, we use\ndots, well Excel is gonna go, that's cool,\n\n140\n00:08:22.565 --> 00:08:25.829\nI have no idea what you're talking about.\n&gt;&gt; It also seems to be the more cool\n\n141\n00:08:25.829 --> 00:08:28.453\nway to represent dates as like, ooh.\n\n142\n00:08:28.453 --> 00:08:31.572\nSo at least that's what I see in\nadvertising and everything like that.\n\n143\n00:08:31.572 --> 00:08:35.012\nBut yes, all of these can get very,\nvery confusing.\n\n144\n00:08:35.012 --> 00:08:37.400\nSo just be careful, and again,\n\n145\n00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:42.618\nthis goes back to you gotta know how\nyou want to enter your dates in, and\n\n146\n00:08:42.618 --> 00:08:47.849\ndo you go by the day, month, year or\ndo you do the months, day, year?\n\n147\n00:08:47.849 --> 00:08:52.590\nKind of depends on what side of globe\nyou're living on to make sure that you\n\n148\n00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:53.744\nare consistent.\n\n149\n00:08:53.744 --> 00:08:58.846\nNowadays with global companies, that\nalso becomes more of a company policy,\n\n150\n00:08:58.846 --> 00:09:03.811\nwhat way is your company going to adhere\nto rather than just you by yourself.\n\n151\n00:09:03.811 --> 00:09:07.585\nSo knowing all that is very important.\n\n152\n00:09:07.585 --> 00:09:12.525\nOkay, so let's move down to,\nwe know that this gets a little confusing,\n\n153\n00:09:12.525 --> 00:09:14.447\nlet's talk about our text.\n\n154\n00:09:14.447 --> 00:09:19.647\nSo if I typed in 3-14-18,\nwe already know that\n\n155\n00:09:19.647 --> 00:09:25.440\nthat's just gonna stay 2/2/02,\nkeeps it that way.\n\n156\n00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:31.354\nWe could do 1.1.18, keeps it that way.\n\n157\n00:09:31.354 --> 00:09:36.420\nJust sees it as text and\nit would never be a number.\n\n158\n00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:39.410\nI'm going to delete this one, and\n\n159\n00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:43.360\ngo back to some more of those ones that\nI was trying to remember how I did it.\n\n160\n00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:52.000\nOkay, so if I zoom out a little bit,\nI'm just gonna take out the zoom, so here,\n\n161\n00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.940\nif I took this and\nI selected all of this and\n\n162\n00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.220\nsaid, hey let's go ahead and\nmake this all a short date.\n\n163\n00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:06.530\nNotice that a lot of them will change, but\nthese down here didn't change, did it?\n\n164\n00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:09.010\nThey're never going to\nget out of being text.\n\n165\n00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:12.325\nYou've got to be very,\nvery careful about that, it's weird.\n\n166\n00:10:12.325 --> 00:10:15.300\nI'll show you a work-around in\njust a second, but do know that.\n\n167\n00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:20.305\nNow if I change this to a date,\nthe one thing that\n\n168\n00:10:20.305 --> 00:10:26.448\nI didn't do was show you what\nif I typed in the number five?\n\n169\n00:10:26.448 --> 00:10:29.946\nIt's just a number.\n\n170\n00:10:29.946 --> 00:10:34.533\nThat's January 5th, 1900.\n\n171\n00:10:34.533 --> 00:10:37.946\nOkay and even here if I typed in 100.\n\n172\n00:10:40.489 --> 00:10:43.275\n[LAUGH] April 9th of 1900.\n\n173\n00:10:43.275 --> 00:10:46.450\nWhat's going on here Justin?\n\n174\n00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:50.351\nYou know the answer.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah but humor me here,\n\n175\n00:10:50.351 --> 00:10:54.447\ntype in 364 in one of those, and\n\n176\n00:10:54.447 --> 00:10:58.984\nit should be, okay, type in 366.\n\n177\n00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.331\nType in 367.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n178\n00:11:03.331 --> 00:11:05.009\n&gt;&gt; 1900's a leap year,\n\n179\n00:11:05.009 --> 00:11:10.053\nI forgot.\n&gt;&gt; So, it starts counting a one,\n\n180\n00:11:10.053 --> 00:11:15.616\nwhat happens if you put zero in?\n&gt;&gt; That is a non-existent date.\n\n181\n00:11:15.616 --> 00:11:16.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes!\n\n182\n00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:19.160\n&gt;&gt; But that's important to know.\n\n183\n00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.760\nIt'll start on a non-existing date.\n\n184\n00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.970\nAnd also, just a quick aside,\nif you scroll down a little bit,\n\n185\n00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:25.443\nthat 1.1.18.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n186\n00:11:25.443 --> 00:11:26.034\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't give you\n\n187\n00:11:26.034 --> 00:11:27.550\nan error.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n188\n00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:29.250\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't recognize that as a number,\n\n189\n00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:32.370\nso it can't do a conversion to a date and\nthat kind of explains our previous\n\n190\n00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:33.120\nbehavior.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n191\n00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.895\nBut I found that, that's weird.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And it's formatted as text,\n\n192\n00:11:36.895 --> 00:11:38.640\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n193\n00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.873\n&gt;&gt; Just because you did this to me on\n\n194\n00:11:40.873 --> 00:11:46.250\nthe last one and I thought it was really\ninteresting cuz I had never done this,\n\n195\n00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:48.676\nbecause what if I typed in -1?\n\n196\n00:11:48.676 --> 00:11:53.800\nAnd then I think it's just too big\nto display and then nope it won't.\n\n197\n00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:59.024\nYou could make this column as wide\nas you want, it'll never give\n\n198\n00:11:59.024 --> 00:12:05.143\nyou that number because In Excel land,\nnothing existed before 1900.\n\n199\n00:12:05.143 --> 00:12:08.920\nAnd so that's where you just\nsaid that's a leap year.\n\n200\n00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.110\nLet's do this, let's come over here.\n\n201\n00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:15.810\nLet's come over to a blank area,\nbecause why is it doing that?\n\n202\n00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:20.420\nYes all of these dates that you have,\n\n203\n00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:25.020\nthey're numbers, you're like but\nit's not a number, but it is.\n\n204\n00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:29.915\nThe computer doesn't know what date it is,\nit's a look up table.\n\n205\n00:12:29.915 --> 00:12:35.789\nIt is some reference that says\nwe're going to start counting at 1,\n\n206\n00:12:35.789 --> 00:12:42.800\n1 being January 1st, 1900, 2, 3,\n4, and then we keep on going.\n\n207\n00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.060\nSo that's what it's doing.\n\n208\n00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:46.530\nI just realized I don't know why\nI went over to a blank area,\n\n209\n00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:51.990\nbecause then I can come back over to here,\nand say hey, why don't we do this?\n\n210\n00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:54.570\nWhat, sorry,\nI was trying to make this column right.\n\n211\n00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:59.460\nWhy don't we take these, and\nshow you what their numbers are?\n\n212\n00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:02.978\nWe took a date and convert it to a number,\nthat's what it is.\n\n213\n00:13:02.978 --> 00:13:07.160\nThat's all you've got going on here is\na number in the background that Excel is\n\n214\n00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.780\nthinking and mapping to what date it is.\n\n215\n00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:11.640\nAnd that's where it starts.\n\n216\n00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:16.630\nAnd we have this whole counting from zero,\nthat's where it's gonna start, or\n\n217\n00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:20.340\none, I guess, really,\ncuz zero we saw was not existent.\n\n218\n00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:21.490\nAnd that's how it's gonna go ahead and\n\n219\n00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:24.190\nit can't go the other way.\n&gt;&gt; I think it's funny that it doesn't\n\n220\n00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:26.730\nallow you to do negative numbers,\nit just kind of breaks.\n\n221\n00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:30.700\nBut it says zero is 101900, as a date.\n\n222\n00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.210\nWhich is still non-existent.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n223\n00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:33.800\n&gt;&gt; It just kind of cracks me up\n\n224\n00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.205\nthat it's like, no, no, no, no.\n\n225\n00:13:35.205 --> 00:13:37.520\n101900's the beginning of all time.\n\n226\n00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:38.650\nThat's not real.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n227\n00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:41.060\n&gt;&gt; Now, Vonne said it's a lookup table and\n\n228\n00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.700\nsome of you were like,\nhold on, the date's the date.\n\n229\n00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:48.590\nActually, all the dates that we use\nare based on some kind of previous event.\n\n230\n00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:50.470\nThey said this point in\ntime is the beginning,\n\n231\n00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:52.100\nand we're going to count forward.\n\n232\n00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:56.640\nIn the case of Excel,\nit's January 1st, or January 0, 1900.\n\n233\n00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:01.020\nAnd it says every day after\nthat is a respective date, and\n\n234\n00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:01.990\nthat's how it does it.\n\n235\n00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:04.780\nIt allows you to create mathematical\nrelationships between some\n\n236\n00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:08.241\nformer reference time and now.\n\n237\n00:14:08.241 --> 00:14:12.700\nAnd which means technically it's backed\nby a number, all of the dates that you\n\n238\n00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:16.820\ntalk about are exactly the same thing.\n&gt;&gt; I'm over here kind of\n\n239\n00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:21.535\ninternally cracking up because for\nmy college graduation speech the guy\n\n240\n00:14:21.535 --> 00:14:25.230\n[LAUGH] it was like something straight\nout of the Ferris Bueller movie.\n\n241\n00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:27.200\nHe was like, time?\n\n242\n00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.310\nWhat is time?\n\n243\n00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:30.100\nAnd then I'm like, gosh.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n244\n00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:31.675\n&gt;&gt; And then it took forever, and\n\n245\n00:14:31.675 --> 00:14:33.502\nit was just though the whole like,\n\n246\n00:14:33.502 --> 00:14:37.670\nI think there was something along like\nwhere we start and where you go forward.\n\n247\n00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:39.550\nI'm like yeah that sounds familiar.\n\n248\n00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:41.720\nSo [LAUGH] but\nthat was a whole other thing,\n\n249\n00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:45.316\nanyways that is something to keep in\nmind because if I came into here,\n\n250\n00:14:45.316 --> 00:14:48.550\nit is formatted as a date and\nI type in a whole bunch of numbers.\n\n251\n00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:49.390\nWell guess what?\n\n252\n00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:54.180\nThat is what, well, did I pick\na number that, I took it too far.\n\n253\n00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:59.798\nOkay, [LAUGH] I was trying to\ndo something like, come on.\n\n254\n00:14:59.798 --> 00:15:01.810\nGive me something, okay.\n\n255\n00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:05.910\nThere, okay,\nI was trying to get it to the year 2809.\n\n256\n00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:09.030\nI guess I went a little too far that way,\ntoo.\n\n257\n00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:12.651\nSo I guess it doesn't have,\nit has the other way too.\n\n258\n00:15:12.651 --> 00:15:14.015\n&gt;&gt; It's odd that it has an upper bound,\n\n259\n00:15:14.015 --> 00:15:17.315\nbecause right now if you have a beginning\nand you're like, we just count the numbers\n\n260\n00:15:17.315 --> 00:15:19.783\nof days, you should just be able to\n[SOUND] calculate it and be done.\n\n261\n00:15:19.783 --> 00:15:21.237\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, hey,\n\n262\n00:15:21.237 --> 00:15:22.755\nwe broke it.\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n\n263\n00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:23.735\n&gt;&gt; Yay, good job.\n\n264\n00:15:23.735 --> 00:15:24.981\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n265\n00:15:24.981 --> 00:15:25.874\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n266\n00:15:25.874 --> 00:15:27.885\njust understand that the date or\n\n267\n00:15:27.885 --> 00:15:31.785\nthe number underlying it is\nsomething to be careful of.\n\n268\n00:15:31.785 --> 00:15:35.350\nAnd if you have cells that\nare pre-formatted as a date,\n\n269\n00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:37.710\nto know why it's doing that.\n\n270\n00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:41.060\nAnd I'm going to undo a couple times so\n\n271\n00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:47.360\nI can get this back into some of the\ndates, because if it's a date, has a date.\n\n272\n00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:53.060\nThen I can come into the different options\nin the number of formatting to be like,\n\n273\n00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:54.960\nwell, do I want the long date?\n\n274\n00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.135\nDo I want the short date?\n\n275\n00:15:56.135 --> 00:15:59.827\nDo I want to have the two-digit\nyear with the zero?\n\n276\n00:15:59.827 --> 00:16:03.913\nDo I want to change it into the day and\nthe month?\n\n277\n00:16:03.913 --> 00:16:05.794\nDo I wanna type it out?\n\n278\n00:16:05.794 --> 00:16:07.989\nDo I wanna have the time with it?\n\n279\n00:16:07.989 --> 00:16:09.650\nWe're gonna do time too.\n\n280\n00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:13.430\nBut if I click this one, okay, well then,\nthere it's going to go ahead and\n\n281\n00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:17.840\nwrite out the month rather than putting\nin the numbers, and so on and so forth.\n\n282\n00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.110\nAnd I keep on clicking that.\n\n283\n00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:25.400\nIf you go down into, well,\nI want to have it with the time.\n\n284\n00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.680\nDid we ever enter any time\nin any of those cells,\n\n285\n00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.380\nJustin?\n&gt;&gt; We did not, and\n\n286\n00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:30.710\nwe were counting by days.\n\n287\n00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:34.260\nAnd based on my experience,\nit makes sense start at 12:00 AM,\n\n288\n00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.350\nthat is the beginning of the day.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n289\n00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:42.310\nif you didn't type it in to begin with,\ngoing back to that what did I input and\n\n290\n00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:46.090\neverything, that could be a little weird.\n\n291\n00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:51.063\nOkay, we'll come back around to that,\nbut the text thing, okay?\n\n292\n00:16:51.063 --> 00:16:55.594\nThis happened to, actually one of my\ncoworkers and she got some information.\n\n293\n00:16:55.594 --> 00:16:58.412\nAnd she kept saying, I don't understand\nwhy I can't implement this thing and\n\n294\n00:16:58.412 --> 00:17:01.820\nI'm like, no, just go up to the number\nform and change this and do all that.\n\n295\n00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:03.120\nIt would not work.\n\n296\n00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.300\nShe was doing these sorting,\nshe's like, see it's not changing.\n\n297\n00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:09.428\nAnd I'm like, [SOUND] it took me\na while and I'm like, [SOUND].\n\n298\n00:17:09.428 --> 00:17:15.980\nAnd I realized, yup, you've got a problem,\nit's text, you can never bring it.\n\n299\n00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:20.560\nBut this is not a series that\ntalks about functions, but\n\n300\n00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:25.730\nI have to do this cuz I just\nfeel like you need to know this.\n\n301\n00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:29.460\nThere is a function call the date value,\nand\n\n302\n00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:33.040\nright here you can see that\nthis cells are format as text.\n\n303\n00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.950\nWe know we can't change into a date,\n\n304\n00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:37.860\nbecause it will never let\nus change into a date.\n\n305\n00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:42.430\nBut the function of date value,\n\n306\n00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:46.290\nI'm saying perform the date\nvalue on this particular cell.\n\n307\n00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:48.810\nIt ends up with this, a number.\n\n308\n00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:51.860\nWe learned that numbers are dates.\n\n309\n00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:56.400\nSo I took this and I asked to do any\n\n310\n00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:01.990\nfunction on these cells,\nI then took this information, I copied it.\n\n311\n00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:05.435\nCame over to here and\nI pasted it as just the values,\n\n312\n00:18:05.435 --> 00:18:09.250\ncuz if I just do the regular paste,\nthen it's trying to paste the function and\n\n313\n00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:11.070\nthen it does this reference and\nyou don't want to do that.\n\n314\n00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:14.540\nThen you're actually doing circular\nreference, don't worry about it.\n\n315\n00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:17.080\nSo you just go ahead and choose values.\n\n316\n00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:23.650\nAnd as values, then I can just take\nthese numbers and turn them into dates.\n\n317\n00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:24.990\nAnd so it works.\n\n318\n00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:28.720\nI chose the long date format\ninstead of the short date format.\n\n319\n00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.750\nSo it can be done.\n\n320\n00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:36.048\nIt works great in my example,\ntest it, be careful.\n\n321\n00:18:36.048 --> 00:18:41.046\nIt should work, but I am always\na little wary about some of this stuff,\n\n322\n00:18:41.046 --> 00:18:43.604\nespecially if you had a lot of data.\n\n323\n00:18:43.604 --> 00:18:46.760\nBut it can be done, so I just thought\nthat was kinda neat to be able.\n\n324\n00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:50.010\nYou can convert it in a roundabout way.\n\n325\n00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.555\nTime, what is time?\n\n326\n00:18:54.555 --> 00:18:55.790\n[LAUGH].\n\n327\n00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:59.598\nIn Excel it can be a little weird,\n\n328\n00:18:59.598 --> 00:19:04.766\ncuz these are all like\nvalid ways that we would\n\n329\n00:19:04.766 --> 00:19:09.397\nrepresent time in normal land, right?\n\n330\n00:19:09.397 --> 00:19:15.471\n5:00 PM, 3:30 AM, this is 2:21 PM.\n\n331\n00:19:15.471 --> 00:19:17.272\nThis is military time, right?\n\n332\n00:19:17.272 --> 00:19:22.156\nI mean, these are all different\nways that you can type it in.\n\n333\n00:19:22.156 --> 00:19:24.170\nBut it goes back to the whole pattern.\n\n334\n00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:27.850\nIf I wanna say, hey, let's go ahead and\ntake all of these and\n\n335\n00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:31.010\nlet's format it as time.\n\n336\n00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:32.550\nOnly one of them changed, didn't it?\n\n337\n00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:36.031\nLike why did it do that,\ncuz it doesn't see this as time.\n\n338\n00:19:36.031 --> 00:19:38.290\nIt's kind of like it just sees it as text.\n\n339\n00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:41.450\nIt didn't follow the right pattern or\n\n340\n00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:46.100\nthe kind of underlying information to\nknow that I can format it as time.\n\n341\n00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:50.644\nThese are already formatted\nas time when I scroll over.\n\n342\n00:19:50.644 --> 00:19:51.721\nSee these right there?\n\n343\n00:19:51.721 --> 00:19:52.745\nThey're time.\n\n344\n00:19:52.745 --> 00:19:58.335\nSo if I take this and say,\nall right, well, let's go ahead and\n\n345\n00:19:58.335 --> 00:20:02.767\nchange these cells into\na different time format,\n\n346\n00:20:02.767 --> 00:20:06.689\nlet's do the military time, right there.\n\n347\n00:20:06.689 --> 00:20:11.775\nAnd the seconds, if I click okay, then\nit's gonna go ahead and do that, right?\n\n348\n00:20:11.775 --> 00:20:13.090\nBecause it's already that way.\n\n349\n00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:19.550\nI wouldn't be able to do it, so you gotta\nbe able to follow a pattern on that one.\n\n350\n00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:23.531\nIt gets a little weird.\n&gt;&gt; I do have a question, so 5:00 PM,\n\n351\n00:20:23.531 --> 00:20:28.747\nwe select all those and only changed in\norder to affect having the time pattern.\n\n352\n00:20:28.747 --> 00:20:33.134\nBut if we click on the 5:00 PM,\ndoes that actually show\n\n353\n00:20:33.134 --> 00:20:36.760\nthe column over the original one?\n&gt;&gt; This one right here?\n\n354\n00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that shows time.\n\n355\n00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:42.570\nIf we now change that to something\nelse like a number, right?\n\n356\n00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:46.010\nOkay, but\nthat's something that I was like,\n\n357\n00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:51.430\nhold on, it's keeping that as a time\nformat, so that cell is formatted as time.\n\n358\n00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:56.220\nSo if I then re-enter something else that\nactually falls, then it will update,\n\n359\n00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:57.350\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Let's see, so\n\n360\n00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:59.680\nif I said let's do time, right?\n\n361\n00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.010\nSo I'm gonna type over this cell, right?\n\n362\n00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:04.063\nSo what I type in 5:00 PM.\n\n363\n00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:12.721\nNo, but if I typed in 5:25,\n\n364\n00:21:12.721 --> 00:21:16.710\nthen it goes ahead.\n\n365\n00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:22.030\nBut do you notice how I had to type\nin the colon, and it just went to AM.\n\n366\n00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:23.451\nWhat if that was PM?\n\n367\n00:21:23.451 --> 00:21:26.657\nSo if I came back in and\n\n368\n00:21:26.657 --> 00:21:32.010\nsaid 3:23 PM, then it does it.\n\n369\n00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:36.809\nSo you still have to type in a lot\nof it to make it realize that you're\n\n370\n00:21:36.809 --> 00:21:39.485\ntyping in a time, and not just text.\n\n371\n00:21:39.485 --> 00:21:44.202\nAnd it's the same thing back on like\nthis date that's formatted as text,\n\n372\n00:21:44.202 --> 00:21:47.719\nI can come under here and say,\nyou go ahead and be time.\n\n373\n00:21:47.719 --> 00:21:49.300\nIt doesn't matter, it's still text.\n\n374\n00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:52.503\nNow you be a date or a percentage, no.\n\n375\n00:21:52.503 --> 00:21:57.735\nIt's not, so it's like that\ndata still kind of holds on and\n\n376\n00:21:57.735 --> 00:22:01.333\nit won't go away.\n&gt;&gt; I do have a follow up question about\n\n377\n00:22:01.333 --> 00:22:03.511\nthat AM and PM thing, cuz that bugs me,\n\n378\n00:22:03.511 --> 00:22:06.421\neven though we may be the only\npeople who use AM, PM.\n\n379\n00:22:06.421 --> 00:22:08.085\nThat's a weird thing.\n\n380\n00:22:08.085 --> 00:22:13.070\nWhat if I got into that same cell and\nI type, 15:23, without AM,\n\n381\n00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:14.430\nPM, what do I get?\n\n382\n00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:15.730\nWhat do I see?\n&gt;&gt; So this cell,\n\n383\n00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:16.970\nthe one we were working on before.\n\n384\n00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:22.805\nSo 15:23, nothing else.\n&gt;&gt; Nothing else.\n\n385\n00:22:22.805 --> 00:22:26.486\nOkay, so if you do know military time or\n\n386\n00:22:26.486 --> 00:22:31.516\n24 hour clock,\nthen you can get around the AM, PM.\n\n387\n00:22:31.516 --> 00:22:32.152\nBut you still have to type\n\n388\n00:22:32.152 --> 00:22:32.732\nthat colon, though.\n\n389\n00:22:32.732 --> 00:22:33.465\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So it's kind\n\n390\n00:22:33.465 --> 00:22:34.150\nof annoying.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n391\n00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:35.730\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, is there a way around\n\n392\n00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:38.360\nthat?\n&gt;&gt; Not that I know of, I mean,\n\n393\n00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:41.530\nthat's the only indication to be time.\n\n394\n00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:45.020\nNow I guess you could do\nyour custom number formats,\n\n395\n00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:49.300\nin the sense of like I know this\ncolumn is going to be time.\n\n396\n00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:51.679\nI'm representing time.\n\n397\n00:22:51.679 --> 00:22:57.036\nBut I wanna be able to type in,\n11, 1, 1, 1, 2 and\n\n398\n00:22:57.036 --> 00:23:02.654\njust put a colon in between it,\nbut then I'd still have to.\n\n399\n00:23:02.654 --> 00:23:05.840\nNow the AM, PM,\nthat's a whole other thing too.\n\n400\n00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:09.710\nSo maybe just go straight to military\ntime and then don't worry about it.\n\n401\n00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:12.480\nBut then if you're not really\nthinking in military time or\n\n402\n00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:16.260\nmeasuring, this is just one\nof the weird ones, okay?\n\n403\n00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:20.832\nYou have to just follow the rules\nof what it wants you to be for\n\n404\n00:23:20.832 --> 00:23:23.055\ntime.\n&gt;&gt; Now we're in a number format,\n\n405\n00:23:23.055 --> 00:23:25.565\nwe have an 11:00 ,12:00 PM there.\n\n406\n00:23:25.565 --> 00:23:26.871\nWhat if I now change that back to\n\n407\n00:23:26.871 --> 00:23:28.575\na number?\n&gt;&gt; This one?\n\n408\n00:23:28.575 --> 00:23:30.139\n&gt;&gt; Yup, what does that look like?\n\n409\n00:23:30.139 --> 00:23:30.812\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n410\n00:23:30.812 --> 00:23:34.250\nI will take this back to a number.\n&gt;&gt; 0.97,\n\n411\n00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:37.472\nI bet that's in reference to a day.\n\n412\n00:23:37.472 --> 00:23:41.795\n11, 12 is 0.97 of a day.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it is.\n\n413\n00:23:41.795 --> 00:23:46.463\n&gt;&gt; So what if we put 1:00 PM?\n\n414\n00:23:46.463 --> 00:23:50.312\nIt should be roughly the same.\n\n415\n00:23:50.312 --> 00:23:53.150\n0.45, so it's 0.45 of a day.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n416\n00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:53.711\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n417\n00:23:53.711 --> 00:23:57.073\nAll right, cuz I know that our\ndates are backed up by numbers, so\n\n418\n00:23:57.073 --> 00:23:58.767\nI was like what about time?\n\n419\n00:23:58.767 --> 00:24:02.305\nBecause we've kind of just said,\ndates, don't worry about that,\n\n420\n00:24:02.305 --> 00:24:03.957\nI'm just looking at right now.\n\n421\n00:24:03.957 --> 00:24:10.030\nRight, so that gives you a number\nrepresentative how long in the day it is.\n\n422\n00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:11.200\n&gt;&gt; So this right here,\n\n423\n00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.270\nif we were talking about this.\n\n424\n00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:16.350\nIf we went ahead and\nrepresented this as a number, okay?\n\n425\n00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:23.350\nBut if I change this decimal to,\nif I say 0.54, right?\n\n426\n00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:29.270\nAnd that's just the number, but now we\nturn this back to our date format, right?\n\n427\n00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:33.970\nWe go back to the date that I really\nwant it to be the date and the time,\n\n428\n00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:39.392\nwhich would be right here.\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n\n429\n00:24:39.392 --> 00:24:40.085\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n\n430\n00:24:40.085 --> 00:24:41.435\n&gt;&gt; But I noticed something there.\n\n431\n00:24:41.435 --> 00:24:47.312\nWe put 0.54,\nthe 0.54 over there was 1 something.\n\n432\n00:24:47.312 --> 00:24:49.980\nThat one over there is 12 something.\n&gt;&gt; But look at the number up there.\n\n433\n00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:51.933\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] We're getting decimal play,\n\n434\n00:24:51.933 --> 00:24:53.386\nwe gotta be careful there.\n\n435\n00:24:53.386 --> 00:24:55.640\n[SOUND] Tricky, tricky.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n436\n00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:57.427\n&gt;&gt; Which actually makes me think,\n\n437\n00:24:57.427 --> 00:25:01.863\nif I'm typing in a date can I also type in\ntimes even if I do not necessarily want to\n\n438\n00:25:01.863 --> 00:25:03.230\nshow those up?\n\n439\n00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:06.810\nLike that, let's just change\nit to the short date format.\n\n440\n00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:08.971\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna delete these just so\n\n441\n00:25:08.971 --> 00:25:11.449\nit doesn't get ourselves confused.\n\n442\n00:25:11.449 --> 00:25:13.367\n[SOUND] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n443\n00:25:13.367 --> 00:25:14.386\nwe thought we were gonna delete them.\n\n444\n00:25:14.386 --> 00:25:15.599\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n445\n00:25:15.599 --> 00:25:19.211\n[LAUGH] Okay, let's take these guys here.\n\n446\n00:25:19.211 --> 00:25:22.698\nWe will delete that, and\nwe will select these and\n\n447\n00:25:22.698 --> 00:25:26.583\nwe will make it a short date format, okay.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n448\n00:25:26.583 --> 00:25:31.458\nnow if we come to the top and\nlet's say 12-29, 1900 and then,\n\n449\n00:25:31.458 --> 00:25:35.784\nI don't know, 14 like a space?\n&gt;&gt; So 12 dash 29 dash,\n\n450\n00:25:35.784 --> 00:25:39.465\nwe'll just go 85 or 86 for now.\n&gt;&gt; Space.\n\n451\n00:25:39.465 --> 00:25:40.021\n&gt;&gt; Space.\n\n452\n00:25:40.021 --> 00:25:42.659\n&gt;&gt; And then like 14:22.\n\n453\n00:25:42.659 --> 00:25:44.181\n&gt;&gt; 14:22, okay.\n\n454\n00:25:44.181 --> 00:25:45.514\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n455\n00:25:45.514 --> 00:25:50.634\nwe see that it's 12/29/1986, all right?\n\n456\n00:25:50.634 --> 00:25:54.390\nBut up in the formula bar, [SOUND] we\nget to preserve that time information.\n\n457\n00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:58.447\nSo now if we come back and change it to\nthe date time, we should still have that,\n\n458\n00:25:58.447 --> 00:26:00.230\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\n\n459\n00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:05.540\nthat's where it's remembering\nthe raw data that we typed in.\n\n460\n00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:09.210\nSo it's remembering it,\ncuz we told it in the original,\n\n461\n00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:11.340\nthe short date format,\ndon't include the time.\n\n462\n00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:18.330\nBut I did type it in as it likes the way\nthe time goes with date and time.\n\n463\n00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:20.710\nCuz date and time are really\nalmost like the same thing,\n\n464\n00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:23.390\nif you wanna say in this situation.\n\n465\n00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:29.520\nSo yeah, if I go into here and then scroll\ndown to, go down to the one that I want\n\n466\n00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:34.876\nthe time with it, it will bring it up.\n&gt;&gt; Now, if we change this one to number,\n\n467\n00:26:34.876 --> 00:26:38.714\nbecause we turned it into time, we should\nsee a fractional number now, right?\n\n468\n00:26:38.714 --> 00:26:39.518\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n469\n00:26:39.518 --> 00:26:40.110\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n470\n00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:40.843\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n471\n00:26:40.843 --> 00:26:42.170\n&gt;&gt; And I would even make a strong\n\n472\n00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:45.888\nreassertion, but I would argue that date\nand time are exactly the same entity.\n\n473\n00:26:45.888 --> 00:26:49.349\nWe just have two different ways of\nrepresenting a larger scales, right?\n\n474\n00:26:49.349 --> 00:26:53.975\nSo hours of a day, okay,\nwe have some way to represent that.\n\n475\n00:26:53.975 --> 00:26:56.067\nBut then if I'm talking about since 1900,\n\n476\n00:26:56.067 --> 00:26:58.220\nI need some way to give\na different scale to that.\n\n477\n00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:05.070\nSo for me based on my experience, I always\nconsider date and time together, like what\n\n478\n00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:07.880\nday is it and what time did it happen?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n479\n00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:11.080\nthis starts getting into the metaphysical\nworld and like, what is time?\n\n480\n00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:11.580\nWhat is it?\n\n481\n00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:13.330\nAnd then you start to\nreally think about it, and\n\n482\n00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:15.580\nit makes you kinda go a little loopy.\n\n483\n00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:19.748\nAnd you go, okay, yes, blue.\n\n484\n00:27:19.748 --> 00:27:23.870\n[LAUGH] And you kinda get yourself\nout of that like thinking loop of\n\n485\n00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:26.650\nthe infinite and everything like that.\n&gt;&gt; I have\n\n486\n00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:28.500\none final question.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n487\n00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.589\n&gt;&gt; If we go to that date value function\n\n488\n00:27:30.589 --> 00:27:32.182\nthat we saw from the text.\n\n489\n00:27:32.182 --> 00:27:32.771\n&gt;&gt; Over here?\n\n490\n00:27:32.771 --> 00:27:33.837\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n491\n00:27:33.837 --> 00:27:37.969\n&gt;&gt; Let's go change 3-12-99.\n\n492\n00:27:37.969 --> 00:27:43.387\nLet's add something that\nlooks like a time component,\n\n493\n00:27:43.387 --> 00:27:48.004\nlike a 1 colon, so up there space, 1:33.\n\n494\n00:27:48.004 --> 00:27:49.845\nI don't know,\nit's like 1:33 in the morning.\n\n495\n00:27:49.845 --> 00:27:54.073\nSo we go there, did that change that?\n&gt;&gt; It\n\n496\n00:27:54.073 --> 00:27:57.784\ndoesn't look like it.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n497\n00:27:57.784 --> 00:27:59.534\n&gt;&gt; I mean, cuz this is still the formula.\n\n498\n00:27:59.534 --> 00:28:03.747\nI mean, technically if I changed,\n\n499\n00:28:03.747 --> 00:28:07.964\nwell, if I typed in 2-2-02.\n\n500\n00:28:07.964 --> 00:28:09.800\nSee, that one changed.\n\n501\n00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:15.810\nBut it doesn't seem to\nlike the time after it.\n\n502\n00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:19.250\nAnd this could be the way the function,\nI mean,\n\n503\n00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:22.955\nthe function saying a date function,\ndate value.\n\n504\n00:28:22.955 --> 00:28:28.153\nSo I don't know if there's a time value,\nI don't know if there's a date and time.\n\n505\n00:28:28.153 --> 00:28:31.632\nThis is going a little bit fast,\nyou got me Justin.\n\n506\n00:28:31.632 --> 00:28:32.333\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n507\n00:28:32.333 --> 00:28:33.381\n&gt;&gt; You finally got me.\n\n508\n00:28:33.381 --> 00:28:35.182\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] Well,\n\n509\n00:28:35.182 --> 00:28:39.875\nI actually kind of anticipate, this makes\nsense cuz it says date value, right?\n\n510\n00:28:39.875 --> 00:28:43.385\nWell, it doesn't say I'm gonna give you\nthe time associated with that date,\n\n511\n00:28:43.385 --> 00:28:45.201\nlike how far into that particular date.\n\n512\n00:28:45.201 --> 00:28:50.234\nSo I wasn't out to get you, I was just\nlike, let me break it, hold on, hold on.\n\n513\n00:28:50.234 --> 00:28:50.878\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n514\n00:28:50.878 --> 00:28:53.118\n&gt;&gt; Because these are all kind of like data\n\n515\n00:28:53.118 --> 00:28:58.380\nmanipulations that you will do if you\nget raw data from somewhere else, right?\n\n516\n00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:04.200\nSo knowing these kind of edge cases is\nvery important to not be frustrated when\n\n517\n00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:07.030\nyou're trying to make transformations.\n&gt;&gt; And while you were talking,\n\n518\n00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:10.490\nif you just wanna jump down my screen\nin case you all, when we were talking,\n\n519\n00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:13.290\nremember the whole\nrepresenting it with the dot?\n\n520\n00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:15.270\nLook at what I did with the date value.\n\n521\n00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:17.987\nIt's like, [SOUND] I don't like that.\n\n522\n00:29:17.987 --> 00:29:20.819\nIt couldn't understand it with the dot.\n\n523\n00:29:20.819 --> 00:29:26.819\nIt said 1-1-02, then it sees it.\n\n524\n00:29:26.819 --> 00:29:31.805\nSo all of these patterns and what we need\nto make sure that we type in the right,\n\n525\n00:29:31.805 --> 00:29:36.740\nthe limiters, the place holders,\nall these stuff does make a difference.\n\n526\n00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:40.360\nAnd while we're giving you all\nsorts of wonderful scenarios, and\n\n527\n00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:43.080\nI'm sure you've all run\ninto lots of scenarios.\n\n528\n00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.968\nNone of them are always the same, okay?\n\n529\n00:29:44.968 --> 00:29:47.235\nAnd that's where you've gotta be very,\nvery careful.\n\n530\n00:29:47.235 --> 00:29:50.686\nAnd that's why I said\ndo it on a small set,\n\n531\n00:29:50.686 --> 00:29:55.926\nyou don't want to do 50,000 rows and\nit's still wrong.\n\n532\n00:29:55.926 --> 00:30:01.812\nThis is the problem with data period,\nit's hard to trust sometimes and\n\n533\n00:30:01.812 --> 00:30:06.436\njust letting our computers\njust do what it's gonna do.\n\n534\n00:30:06.436 --> 00:30:09.443\nYou still need to have a little\nbit of a human component.\n\n535\n00:30:09.443 --> 00:30:13.221\nBut getting into that metaphysical area,\nwhere it's like we need to go, we need to,\n\n536\n00:30:13.221 --> 00:30:14.069\nback up, back up.\n\n537\n00:30:14.069 --> 00:30:15.437\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well Vonne,\n\n538\n00:30:15.437 --> 00:30:19.650\nI can definitely see that we need to go\nbefore we dive too deep into the weeds.\n\n539\n00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:21.140\nWe're about right here.\n\n540\n00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:23.110\nI'm starting to have\na hard time breathing.\n\n541\n00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:24.270\nBut you're absolutely correct.\n\n542\n00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:28.287\nData is dirty, and it needs a little\nbit of human touch to clean it up.\n\n543\n00:30:28.287 --> 00:30:32.388\nSo do keep these in mind as you're kind\nof manipulating dates and numbers.\n\n544\n00:30:32.388 --> 00:30:37.130\nAnd I think this actually concludes our\nmini series on various number formats.\n\n545\n00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:41.580\nWe dove deep into a few of those, and\nthat's to help you not be frustrated and\n\n546\n00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:42.920\nbecome more productive.\n\n547\n00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:45.450\nSo definitely come on back,\nwe got more coming at you.\n\n548\n00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:47.320\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n549\n00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:50.180\nSigning out for Office Pro TV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n550\n00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:50.916\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n551\n00:30:50.916 --> 00:30:51.759\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n552\n00:30:51.759 --> 00:30:58.223\n[SOUND]\n\n",

OFFICEPRO.TV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n4\n00:00:09.745 --> 00:00:14.085\nI'm your host, Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with Excel 2016 Essentials.\n\n5\n00:00:14.085 --> 00:00:17.820\nRight now, we're gonna learn about proof,\nprint and page layout.\n\n6\n00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.560\nAnd the person bringing us all that\ngreat information is the one, the only,\n\n7\n00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.980\nVonne Smith, right over here.\n\n8\n00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.310\nVonne, how are you doing?\n\n9\n00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.900\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic.\n\n10\n00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:26.519\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for joining us.\n\n11\n00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.773\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, yes, I'd like to put all\nthose, you know, the proof, print and\n\n12\n00:00:29.773 --> 00:00:32.290\npage layout, they just kind of-\n&gt;&gt; Proof, print, page layout.\n\n13\n00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthey just kind of roll off your tongue.\n\n14\n00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.370\nSo [LAUGH],\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, it does, it does.\n\n15\n00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.365\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, we're gonna learn about,\nwell, proof, print, and page layout.\n\n16\n00:00:39.365 --> 00:00:40.120\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n17\n00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.430\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna talk a little bit\nabout all the wonderful spellcheck,\n\n18\n00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.280\nand we're gonna get into the Thesaurus.\n\n19\n00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.450\n&gt;&gt; Thesaurus.\n\n20\n00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.060\n&gt;&gt; I always have to stop and\n\n21\n00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.520\nactually say it because it's a-\n&gt;&gt; Thesaurus.\n\n22\n00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.610\n&gt;&gt; It's a hard way to say, exactly, and so\n\n23\n00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.120\nthen we're gonna also talk about our page\nlayout when we get into our margins.\n\n24\n00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.620\nOur orientations and the different ways\nthat we can do our page breaks, and\n\n25\n00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.590\nall that kind of fun stuff.\n\n26\n00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.790\nSo, let's hop right on down.\n\n27\n00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.450\nSo we have our file with page layout,\n.xlsx,\n\n28\n00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.620\nthat's another hard one to say, as well.\n\n29\n00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.380\nWe're back with our Christmas cats.\n\n30\n00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.230\nRight, so if this looks very much\nlike our Christmas cats example file,\n\n31\n00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.400\nit pretty much is.\n\n32\n00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.640\nBut I went ahead and added a few more\naddresses in there, to be able to\n\n33\n00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.940\ndemonstrate some of the concepts that\nwe're going to be talking about.\n\n34\n00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.975\nAll right, so, proofing,\nright, spell check,\n\n35\n00:01:27.975 --> 00:01:31.442\nyou have spell checks in pretty\nmuch all of your programs.\n\n36\n00:01:31.442 --> 00:01:35.294\nIt's always good to go ahead and\nrun a spell check on this,\n\n37\n00:01:35.294 --> 00:01:39.700\nbecause you don't have as many of\nthe default red squigglies, and\n\n38\n00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.682\nthings that you have in word.\n\n39\n00:01:41.682 --> 00:01:45.840\nBecause if you think about it,\nthis is a Spreadsheet program.\n\n40\n00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.110\nThis is things your going to put\nmore like numbers, and addresses.\n\n41\n00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.460\nAnd all that kind of information that\nmaybe a spell check is actually going to\n\n42\n00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.170\ndo more than it needs to.\n\n43\n00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.190\nTo were I have Fuego and Bishop.\n\n44\n00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.270\nActually, let me go ahead and\nmove over here.\n\n45\n00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.640\nAnd it's gonna go ahead check those.\n\n46\n00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.840\nSo, yes, all is gonna do is spellcheck,\nbut sometimes the information that you\n\n47\n00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.460\nhave in Excel is not necessarily going to\nlimit itself for a very easy spellcheck.\n\n48\n00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:21.569\nSo, proofing over spell checking might\nbe something you need to always look at.\n\n49\n00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.390\nBut hey, why don't we go ahead and\nrun one just for fun?\n\n50\n00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.910\nSo we're gonna go over to\nour Review tab right here.\n\n51\n00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.910\nWe come over to our Spelling\nover on the left-hand side.\n\n52\n00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.300\nSo if I click on that, it brings up,\nall right, well what am I looking at?\n\n53\n00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.850\nAnd just to show you,\nover here in the notes,\n\n54\n00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.310\nI have Sals were low due to the holiday.\n\n55\n00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.902\nWell, that really should be Sales, we're\nnot talking about Sal, the pizza maker.\n\n56\n00:02:47.902 --> 00:02:51.540\n[LAUGH] We're we really\nwanna actually have that.\n\n57\n00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.880\nSo, and\nthis is again where you have to determine,\n\n58\n00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.920\nwas that supposed to be Sal's pizza\nplace and I forgot the apostrophe?\n\n59\n00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.275\nOr was that supposed to be sales or,\nor salts?\n\n60\n00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.360\nIt's going to do the spell check,\n\n61\n00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.310\nbut sometimes it's not even gonna\ngive you the suggestions that\n\n62\n00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.560\nare even close to what you want it to be,\nor what you're intended.\n\n63\n00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.060\nSo always do a good look over.\n\n64\n00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.742\nBut in this case,\nI do want to change Sals to Sales,\n\n65\n00:03:18.742 --> 00:03:25.000\nwhich is the first suggestion, and so\nyou have some buttons over here of change.\n\n66\n00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.600\nChange all, autocorrect, which is\ngetting into our autocorrect options.\n\n67\n00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.500\nIn this sense,\nI only wanna change it right now,\n\n68\n00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.580\nI don't want every instance of\nSALS to be changed to sales.\n\n69\n00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.122\nSo I'm gonna click on Change, and\nthen we're gonna keep on going.\n\n70\n00:03:41.122 --> 00:03:42.990\nNow this is one, okay we have Puma.\n\n71\n00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.556\nThat is the correct spelling of Pooma,\nthe way that we decided to spell her name.\n\n72\n00:03:48.556 --> 00:03:54.470\nSo it's P-O-O-M-A, and this is one of\nthose where I don't want it to be changed.\n\n73\n00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.062\nI don't want any suggestions in here.\n\n74\n00:03:56.062 --> 00:04:01.060\nIt's not the Potomac, [LAUGH] so I can\nignore it once, or I can ignore it all.\n\n75\n00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.200\nCuz maybe Pooma's all through\nthis particular worksheet, so\n\n76\n00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.710\nthat's where you have to choose.\n\n77\n00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.410\nThere is another option that you\ncould do with Add to Dictionary.\n\n78\n00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.530\nAdding to the dictionary would\nbe where I want you to stop\n\n79\n00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.870\nseeing that Puma is spelled wrong.\n\n80\n00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.040\nAnd keep it in your memory to say,\nyes, this is how we spell Puma.\n\n81\n00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.240\nOr this is how we spell fuego,\nor what have you.\n\n82\n00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.890\nSo adding to the dictionary,\ncuz maybe ITPRO.TV.\n\n83\n00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.730\nWe're gonna have that all\nthroughout all of our spreadsheets.\n\n84\n00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.310\nStop recognizing it,\nadds it to the dictionary, and\n\n85\n00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.600\nthen it will not check it next time,\nand say, ooh, no, we're good.\n\n86\n00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.260\nThat's how you spell ITPROTV.\n\n87\n00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.870\nUnless you spelled it wrong again,\nbut that's another story.\n\n88\n00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.886\nSo we're going to ignore,\nnow this is another where the stitcher,\n\n89\n00:04:46.886 --> 00:04:49.780\njust to show you this little note.\n\n90\n00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.741\nThere actually is a machinery called\nthe Stitcher Trimmer, it's in mailing and\n\n91\n00:04:55.741 --> 00:05:00.750\nprinting at my husband's print shop,\nthat's where they have it.\n\n92\n00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.920\nSo, that is actually not a misspelled\nword, that is the Stitcher Trimmer.\n\n93\n00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.740\nSo sometimes, it thinks it's wrong,\nsince that's not what it is.\n\n94\n00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.034\nIt is, so we're gonna go ahead and\nignore that, as well.\n\n95\n00:05:12.034 --> 00:05:16.890\nAnd then, we get this warning of, hey,\nso I'm at the end of this document.\n\n96\n00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.580\nDo you wanna start from the beginning?\n\n97\n00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.650\nBecause my cursor, or\nit's not my cursor, sorry.\n\n98\n00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.210\nMy active cell is somewhere down in here.\n\n99\n00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.070\nSo I do wanna go ahead and\ncheck from the beginning.\n\n100\n00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.400\nAnd then it's gonna go back to Puma again,\nthat's alright, we'll go ahead and\n\n101\n00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.520\nignore that.\n\n102\n00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.560\nAnd then we'll ig, here, tolls,\nit's not tolls, it's totals.\n\n103\n00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.740\nSo I go ahead and choose that it's,\nand it's not toils.\n\n104\n00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.540\nSo I have to find a suggestion again.\n\n105\n00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.354\nI spell think so wrong sometimes, [LAUGH],\n\n106\n00:05:44.354 --> 00:05:49.640\nit's not even gonna come close to\ngiving me the right suggestion.\n\n107\n00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:55.170\nSo I will take my totals, and I will\nchange it, and weekly, that's another one.\n\n108\n00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:59.320\nGood, I'm glad I run the spellcheck,\nso I supposed to be changing to that.\n\n109\n00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.350\nAnd now it says, great,\nyou're done, good to go, thank you.\n\n110\n00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.644\nI click OK, and there I go.\n\n111\n00:06:05.644 --> 00:06:10.250\nBut, Zach, I'm sure you understand, it's\nalways good to do a good proofread through\n\n112\n00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.497\nthings, every once in a while, right?\n\n113\n00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:14.691\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nyou gotta have a proofreader, yeah.\n\n114\n00:06:14.691 --> 00:06:15.797\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and sometimes,\n\n115\n00:06:15.797 --> 00:06:18.850\nI've actually had where proofreaders\nthey read it upside down.\n\n116\n00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.990\nSo I take the page, and I turn it\nupside down and read it this way,\n\n117\n00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.035\nbecause that way they're-\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n118\n00:06:23.035 --> 00:06:27.152\n&gt;&gt; They're not actually reading\nthe sentences, cuz we've seen those,\n\n119\n00:06:27.152 --> 00:06:28.738\nI've seen it on Facebook.\n\n120\n00:06:28.738 --> 00:06:32.490\nIts like, if you can read this then you\ncan understand it, its all jumbled and\n\n121\n00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:33.125\nmessed up.\n\n122\n00:06:33.125 --> 00:06:37.405\nBut our brain can read it, cuz we're\nreading it like sentences and text.\n\n123\n00:06:37.405 --> 00:06:39.315\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, right\n&gt;&gt; So I turn it upside down, and\n\n124\n00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:41.785\nthat way they can start to\nkind of actually look at\n\n125\n00:06:41.785 --> 00:06:43.595\nthe text as like the letters.\n\n126\n00:06:43.595 --> 00:06:44.700\n&gt;&gt; Wow, that's cool.\n\n127\n00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:45.660\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if I could do that.\n\n128\n00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.569\n&gt;&gt; I don't think I would do that,\nbut it's cool [LAUGH].\n\n129\n00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:51.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Or maybe you could just like\nstand on your head, and then read upside.\n\n130\n00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:51.750\n&gt;&gt; That would be all right.\n\n131\n00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.942\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, then I'd start passing out and\neverything [LAUGH].\n\n132\n00:06:53.942 --> 00:06:57.352\nHey, there's different ways\nto proof your document, or\n\n133\n00:06:57.352 --> 00:06:59.240\nin this case your spreadsheet.\n\n134\n00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:06.730\nBecause right here, you could see\nthat Bishop had to wok in production.\n\n135\n00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:10.272\nWell, wok is a real word,\nand it's spelled right.\n\n136\n00:07:10.272 --> 00:07:15.613\nBut he's not making stir fry,\nhe's working in production.\n\n137\n00:07:15.613 --> 00:07:18.495\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we need to make sure that we come in\n\n138\n00:07:18.495 --> 00:07:24.123\nhere, and actually come up into our\nformula bar, and change that to work.\n\n139\n00:07:24.123 --> 00:07:28.720\nAnd there we go, make sure you\nalways proof, it's very important.\n\n140\n00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.459\nAnd always have multiple\npeople proof your documents.\n\n141\n00:07:31.459 --> 00:07:36.760\nIf it's something that is really important\nlike going to say the CEO meeting.\n\n142\n00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.290\nYou wanna make sure that things\nare spelled properly and everything.\n\n143\n00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:41.580\nIs in it's right place.\n\n144\n00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.490\n&gt;&gt; And I like the little image of\nthe cat there, it's kind of nice.\n\n145\n00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:45.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's little meow.\n\n146\n00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:46.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's nice, very good.\n\n147\n00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.560\n&gt;&gt; It's a Christmas cat, right?\n\n148\n00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.350\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n149\n00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:54.310\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nlet's talk about the Thesaurus.\n\n150\n00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.293\n&gt;&gt; The-\n&gt;&gt; The Thesaurus-\n\n151\n00:07:56.293 --> 00:07:57.124\n&gt;&gt; The the the.\n\n152\n00:07:57.124 --> 00:08:00.011\n&gt;&gt; The thesaurus is,\nwhat is a Thesaurus there Zach?\n\n153\n00:08:00.011 --> 00:08:05.720\nWell it's to tell you different words that\nmight be similar to the word you're trying\n\n154\n00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:11.270\nto use and so you're not so redundant and\nyou use the same word over and over again.\n\n155\n00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:13.120\n&gt;&gt; The redundant department Steve?\n\n156\n00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah the Department of Redundancy\nDepartment so you can avoid that.\n\n157\n00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:16.845\n&gt;&gt; Yes exactly.\n\n158\n00:08:16.845 --> 00:08:17.360\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n159\n00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.670\n&gt;&gt; I need to have it say it\na little bit differently for me.\n\n160\n00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:23.695\nSo this is where you\ncan use the thesaurus.\n\n161\n00:08:23.695 --> 00:08:24.671\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n162\n00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:28.900\nmaybe I would like to have\nthis particular word.\n\n163\n00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.240\nMaybe, sales were low.\n\n164\n00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.440\nMaybe I want another word for low.\n\n165\n00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.825\nSo I will select the word and\n\n166\n00:08:35.825 --> 00:08:40.387\nnow I will come up on my Review\ntab to the Thesaurus and\n\n167\n00:08:40.387 --> 00:08:46.423\nI will click on here, to where,\nwell what is low like little stumpy?\n\n168\n00:08:46.423 --> 00:08:47.541\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Stumpy!\n\n169\n00:08:47.541 --> 00:08:48.164\n&gt;&gt; Sales were stumpy.\n\n170\n00:08:48.164 --> 00:08:49.597\n[CROSSTALK] But the thing,\n\n171\n00:08:49.597 --> 00:08:53.063\nnow this is gonna be a little\nstrange things that gonna happen.\n\n172\n00:08:53.063 --> 00:08:57.350\nAnd I check this because I'm like,\nwhy isn't this working?\n\n173\n00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:00.790\nNotice I have a word\nselected within a cell.\n\n174\n00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:05.660\nSo I double clicked in my cell, I selected\nthe word, I came over in the source, and\n\n175\n00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.790\nit has given me the different words.\n\n176\n00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:11.820\nBut it won't allow me to scroll,\nthere is a scroll right here.\n\n177\n00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.980\nBut it's not letting me go down and\n\n178\n00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.850\nit kind of threw me off I'm\nlike why is it not working?\n\n179\n00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:20.990\nSo I cuz I do work in a virtual\nmachine on my Mac computer.\n\n180\n00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:24.390\nSo I switched over to my Mac,\nfired up Excel.\n\n181\n00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:27.330\nDid the same thing I'm like,\nit works just fine it scrolls I'm like so\n\n182\n00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:32.010\nI'm hypothesizing that it\ncould be a virtual machine.\n\n183\n00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:38.085\nLike it's not allowing me to do this\nin a selected word within a cell.\n\n184\n00:09:38.085 --> 00:09:43.730\nSo this might be a me thing,\nto where my computer is not wanting\n\n185\n00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:48.310\nit to work this way because Virtual\nMachines can get a little here and there.\n\n186\n00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:52.949\nBut to demonstrate this whole idea\nwhere you'd wanna change the word low,\n\n187\n00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:58.160\nI have created it to where I can\nat least show you the results\n\n188\n00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.070\nfrom selecting the cell, okay?\n\n189\n00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.090\nNot selecting the words in the cell.\n\n190\n00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:04.430\nSo let's try this again.\n\n191\n00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.360\nSo I will select the cell.\n\n192\n00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.930\nWe'll come over here to that button.\n\n193\n00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.495\nAnd we have this yes.\n\n194\n00:10:11.495 --> 00:10:13.010\n[LAUGH] And I can't even say it.\n\n195\n00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:14.440\nNow you see my scroll's working.\n\n196\n00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:20.000\nEverything's working fine because I\nhad the cell selected, not the word.\n\n197\n00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.120\nI can't tell you exactly\nwhy mine's not doing that.\n\n198\n00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.950\nIf your's is doing that too,\nmaybe it's just a natural feature\n\n199\n00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:30.920\nof Excel 2016 on a Windows environment and\nit's not my Virtual Machine.\n\n200\n00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.690\n&gt;&gt; That's actually the VM.\n\n201\n00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:38.174\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I'm giving all of those asterisks\nof like this could be it [LAUGH] but while\n\n202\n00:10:38.174 --> 00:10:43.290\nI have the cell selected of the word low\nand I did wanna put in stumpy in there.\n\n203\n00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:44.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah sales are stumpy.\n\n204\n00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.260\n&gt;&gt; Don't click the word.\n\n205\n00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.000\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you see if you click\nthe word it then puts that\n\n206\n00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.700\nas the word it's gonna look in the\nthesaurus and it throws me off every time\n\n207\n00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:57.700\nin every Office enviroment cuz I'm\nlike okay replace it with stubby.\n\n208\n00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:02.730\nNo, you don't wanna replace it with\nstubby, well you do wanna replace it with\n\n209\n00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:07.690\nstubby but you have to come\nover here to the drop down.\n\n210\n00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:11.962\nNext to the word then to choose Insert or\nyou can right-click.\n\n211\n00:11:11.962 --> 00:11:17.031\nYeah, so [INAUDIBLE] intuitive to\njust click it and it puts it in.\n\n212\n00:11:17.031 --> 00:11:17.869\nIt doesn't work that way.\n\n213\n00:11:17.869 --> 00:11:19.850\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n&gt;&gt; So we're going to insert it and\n\n214\n00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:23.150\nnow you can see that low has\nbeen changed for stumpy.\n\n215\n00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:24.220\n&gt;&gt; Stumpy.\n&gt;&gt; And there you go.\n\n216\n00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:29.950\nOkay perfect, so\nthat's where we can use our thesaurus.\n\n217\n00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:31.710\nWe're also gonna do,\nI'm going to go ahead and\n\n218\n00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:34.760\nshow you the smart look-up,\nbecause that's kind of fun.\n\n219\n00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:40.870\nThis is part of the intelligence\nservices that is turned on in Excel.\n\n220\n00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:45.650\n&gt;&gt; For me this is something that you can\nturn on or off if you go into the file and\n\n221\n00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:48.410\nyou go into options to where\n\n222\n00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:52.520\nright down at the bottom of the general\nthere is Office Intelligence Services.\n\n223\n00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:57.250\nThis is the thing that will automatically\nadd ultimate text to your images.\n\n224\n00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:00.605\nIn this sense go ahead and\nlet you do this smart look up.\n\n225\n00:12:00.605 --> 00:12:03.643\nAnd there's more about the intelligence\nservices that you can click on.\n\n226\n00:12:03.643 --> 00:12:07.618\nAnd I'll actually take you out\nto the website to go ahead and\n\n227\n00:12:07.618 --> 00:12:12.808\nshow you what it does, it is our computers\nand Office just being smart for us.\n\n228\n00:12:12.808 --> 00:12:17.920\nThat's the PowerPoint design which is so\ncool in there and then the editor in Word\n\n229\n00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.080\nand then it does have the smart look\nup throughout all of our products.\n\n230\n00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.100\n&gt;&gt; That's wonderful.\n\n231\n00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:25.160\n&gt;&gt; So we have here,\nwe'll go ahead and close it.\n\n232\n00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:30.300\nIf I wanted to look up Bishop\nlike what's all about Bishop?\n\n233\n00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:34.240\nAnd I clicked Smart Look Up, it, you do\nhave to connect to the internet, too.\n\n234\n00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.320\nSo, and notice that shows like,\nall right, well let's go ahead and\n\n235\n00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.610\ndefine what is a Bishop and\n\n236\n00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:44.306\nthen it gives you some synonyms And\nthen it goes out, look at Wikipedia.\n\n237\n00:12:44.306 --> 00:12:49.520\nDon Bishop, he's a corner back,\nokay, that's great.\n\n238\n00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.730\nAnd then it comes down, here's some\nimages, here's some web searches.\n\n239\n00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:55.270\nSo it's kind of cool that\nit's gonna go out and\n\n240\n00:12:55.270 --> 00:13:00.030\njust kind of give you some references,\nby scanning the Oracle.\n\n241\n00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:02.040\nThey've consulted\nthe Oracle to go ahead and\n\n242\n00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:06.330\ngive you some different things\nof what a bishop might mean.\n\n243\n00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.150\nNow to me this is where I'm like well,\n\n244\n00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:13.660\nwhy aren't you pulling up Ben Bishop\nfrom the [INAUDIBLE] day lightning?\n\n245\n00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.220\n&gt;&gt; But that's cuz that\"s what\n[INAUDIBLE] is named after.\n\n246\n00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:20.545\nHe is named after the goalie, who is\nnow not with the Tampa Bay Lightning,\n\n247\n00:13:20.545 --> 00:13:21.785\nbut that's okay.\n\n248\n00:13:21.785 --> 00:13:22.675\n&gt;&gt; But he was.\n\n249\n00:13:22.675 --> 00:13:24.865\n&gt;&gt; He was, and\nhe was my favorite, number 30.\n\n250\n00:13:24.865 --> 00:13:28.655\nOkay, [LAUGH] but anyways,\nSmart Lookup can be kind of fun.\n\n251\n00:13:28.655 --> 00:13:33.425\nBut you do have to have those intelligent\nservices to be able to use them.\n\n252\n00:13:33.425 --> 00:13:35.970\nAll right,\nnow once I'm done proofing my document,\n\n253\n00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:37.110\n&gt;&gt; A lot of times what you're gonna get\n\n254\n00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:39.660\nready to do after this is print it.\n\n255\n00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:41.310\nAnd this is where everybody struggles.\n\n256\n00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:43.560\nIt's like why can't I get\neverything on the page.\n\n257\n00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:47.070\nAnd it's doing all these weird brakes and\nso on and so forth.\n\n258\n00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:50.690\nhopefully I'm gonna try to alleviate\nsome of that pain for you.\n\n259\n00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:53.100\nAnd be able to make it a little easier.\n\n260\n00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:58.110\nWe're gonna go into print preview\nnow which I can do a controlled p\n\n261\n00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:00.450\non my keyboard to get there.\n\n262\n00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:03.380\nWell, we can also come into File,\nand go to Print,\n\n263\n00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.970\nand it takes me into Print Preview.\n\n264\n00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:10.630\nNow, over here you can see that it's\ncutting off part of the little kitty,\n\n265\n00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:13.280\nright, the little kitty cat's not on here,\nand I have a second page.\n\n266\n00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:19.480\nI know I have a second page because down\nhere at the bottom it says page 1 of 2.\n\n267\n00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.830\nIf I click the little\nbutton to the right And\n\n268\n00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:25.110\nnotice it's just got that\nlast column over there.\n\n269\n00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:27.030\n&gt;&gt; I hate that when it does that.\n\n270\n00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.560\n&gt;&gt; RIght?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n271\n00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's kind of annoying.\n\n272\n00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.580\n&gt;&gt; Please help us fix it.\n\n273\n00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:31.210\n&gt;&gt; I will.\n\n274\n00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:34.900\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So, we have here on the left hand\n\n275\n00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:38.950\nside of what I can do to\nchange this in our settings.\n\n276\n00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:44.920\nWell, first of all Printing is only\ngonna print the active sheet by default.\n\n277\n00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:48.730\nLike I didn't select anything and\nit's not printing the whole work book.\n\n278\n00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:51.380\nLets go back over here to\nnotice that we do have multiple\n\n279\n00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.170\nworksheets within this workbook.\n\n280\n00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:58.040\nWe have Weekly Sales, Chart Data or\nSales Chart, and Addresses.\n\n281\n00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.670\nAnd your like how'd you\nget those names in there?\n\n282\n00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:01.270\nHow'd you make them different color?\n\n283\n00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:04.670\nIt's in the next episode, so\nwe have it at different ones but\n\n284\n00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:07.990\nit's not gonna print your workbook\nout unless you tell it to.\n\n285\n00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:13.310\nSo, these are your different options\nI'm doing Ctrl+P of print what,\n\n286\n00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:16.040\nactive sheet, the entire workbook?\n\n287\n00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.770\nIf I choose entire workbook, notice\nthat my page number has gone down there,\n\n288\n00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:22.720\ngo from from one of two\nto one of nine Wow.\n\n289\n00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.300\n&gt;&gt; Where it's gonna start changing all.\n\n290\n00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:28.580\nNow the chart fits on there perfectly\nthen you get into the addresses and\n\n291\n00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.460\nit's like half of them are over here.\n\n292\n00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:33.060\nAnd then there's the other half and\nit's like where are and\n\n293\n00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:34.830\nthis is really confusing.\n\n294\n00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:39.740\nSo just know that we're gonna stick\nwith active sheets for right now.\n\n295\n00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:44.170\nAnd then we can also talk about\nprinting a selection because\n\n296\n00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:47.760\nIf I want the whole sheet to be printed,\nthat's great.\n\n297\n00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.044\nWhat if I only wanted part\nof the sheet to be printed?\n\n298\n00:15:51.044 --> 00:15:55.584\nLet's come back over here because\nmaybe I only want to have Monday and\n\n299\n00:15:55.584 --> 00:15:59.513\nTuesday's sales of our, for\nour sales representatives.\n\n300\n00:15:59.513 --> 00:16:06.531\nSo I select something first Come over to\nFile, and come over to Print, or Ctrl+P.\n\n301\n00:16:06.531 --> 00:16:09.650\nWell, that's not changing anything,\nyou've gotta tell it.\n\n302\n00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:12.701\nYou gotta come down into here and\nsay Print Selection,\n\n303\n00:16:12.701 --> 00:16:15.270\nyou've gotta have a selection first.\n\n304\n00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:17.160\nGo ahead and choose that, and\n\n305\n00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:21.830\nnow you can see that this is printing\njust that selection that I've made.\n\n306\n00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:27.990\nAnd all the settings that we are going to\ngo over next will be associated with, is\n\n307\n00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:31.510\nit just the active work sheet, is it just\nthe selection, and so on and so forth.\n\n308\n00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:34.690\nNow I just wanna show you,\nbehind my head are two tiny little buttons\n\n309\n00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:38.052\nthat I wanted to point out, they're\nright down here, they're really tiny.\n\n310\n00:16:38.052 --> 00:16:42.260\nBut this bottom one where it says\nzoom to page, if I click it,\n\n311\n00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.840\nyou see that's where it\nzooms in a little bit more.\n\n312\n00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:49.130\nAnd I'm gonna escape, and\nturn off that selection,\n\n313\n00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:52.915\nI'm gonna Ctrl+P again,\ncuz it's a little, well.\n\n314\n00:16:52.915 --> 00:16:54.199\n[LAUGH] I was like, whoa, what happened?\n\n315\n00:16:54.199 --> 00:16:56.589\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Print selection, maybe?\n\n316\n00:16:56.589 --> 00:16:59.325\n&gt;&gt; Yes, look at that, you found it.\n\n317\n00:16:59.325 --> 00:17:02.268\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's still set on print selection,\n\n318\n00:17:02.268 --> 00:17:04.300\nso it kind of freaked me out, too.\n\n319\n00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:07.890\nI was like, nope, nope, nope,\nactive sheet, there you go.\n\n320\n00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:10.980\nSo, if you wanted to see it a little\nbit more, it's just a zoom.\n\n321\n00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:14.660\nCuz it's hard to see from\nthe back of that, but\n\n322\n00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:18.540\nI'm gonna keep it zoomed out for us,\nbut I just wanted to point that.\n\n323\n00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:21.940\nAnd there's another button right here,\nthis is where we're gonna get into show\n\n324\n00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:27.130\nmargins, when we change over\nto modifying our margins.\n\n325\n00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:30.655\nWe can click that button, I can show you,\nwe can drag them rather than type them in.\n\n326\n00:17:30.655 --> 00:17:35.311\nSo just wanted to point that out, but\nnow you can bring me back up [LAUGH].\n\n327\n00:17:35.311 --> 00:17:37.487\nAll right, well first of all,\n\n328\n00:17:37.487 --> 00:17:42.360\nlet's start with this is what,\nthis is portrait versus landscape.\n\n329\n00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:47.070\nI can get more stuff across if I just\nprinted it this way rather than this way.\n\n330\n00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:47.606\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n331\n00:17:47.606 --> 00:17:51.310\nmaybe that would actually fit all my\ninformation on here, so let's try that.\n\n332\n00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:55.290\nYou can do it all,\nright from print preview, cool.\n\n333\n00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:59.991\nChange my orientation from\nportrait to landscape.\n\n334\n00:17:59.991 --> 00:18:02.958\nIt's gotten most, man, but\nit cut off just that tiny little bit.\n\n335\n00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:04.914\n&gt;&gt; Just a little bit there.\n\n336\n00:18:04.914 --> 00:18:07.880\n&gt;&gt; So we gotta change that a little bit.\n\n337\n00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:11.690\nThis is probably one of my favorite parts,\nis scaling.\n\n338\n00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:16.241\nAnd I'm glad that they actually\nput this here in the selections,\n\n339\n00:18:16.241 --> 00:18:19.206\nbecause they used to kinda hide it,\nif you want to say.\n\n340\n00:18:19.206 --> 00:18:24.102\nDown in the page setup,\nwhich is right down there by the way,\n\n341\n00:18:24.102 --> 00:18:27.950\nthe little link to the page\nsetup dialogue box.\n\n342\n00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:32.527\nThis has been around forever,\nway back in older versions of Excel.\n\n343\n00:18:32.527 --> 00:18:33.801\n&gt;&gt; In the olden days.\n\n344\n00:18:33.801 --> 00:18:34.607\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and so\n\n345\n00:18:34.607 --> 00:18:39.932\nwe had to come over into these different\nones in here to change all of the stuff.\n\n346\n00:18:39.932 --> 00:18:42.414\nAnd you'd have to go into the sheet,\n\n347\n00:18:42.414 --> 00:18:45.949\nwhere's the scale,\nit's right there [LAUGH].\n\n348\n00:18:45.949 --> 00:18:48.698\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Scaling, you'd have to kinda adjust it\n\n349\n00:18:48.698 --> 00:18:51.920\nand see what's gonna happen, and\nI don't know how it will fit it.\n\n350\n00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:57.780\nThis is getting so much easier by,\nin my scaling options, I could\n\n351\n00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:01.920\nfit all of our columns on one page,\nmy gosh, it's exactly what I want to do.\n\n352\n00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.610\nOr maybe I want to fit all the rows,\n\n353\n00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:09.010\nif I had other types of information,\nfit everything onto one page.\n\n354\n00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:12.666\nNow, it might make it so\nsmall that you can barely read it.\n\n355\n00:19:12.666 --> 00:19:13.743\n&gt;&gt; A big magnifying glass.\n\n356\n00:19:13.743 --> 00:19:17.620\n&gt;&gt; But at least it goes ahead and\ngives you that scale option.\n\n357\n00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:19.770\nSo if I chose fit all columns,\n\n358\n00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:24.550\nI just need that little bit of\nthe cat left over to fit, there we go.\n\n359\n00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:28.730\nScaling is so much easier, and it's great\nthat it goes ahead and gives you those\n\n360\n00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:35.382\noptions right down on the bottom of\nthese drop downs, so loving that.\n\n361\n00:19:35.382 --> 00:19:40.300\nFantastic, so a few other things you\ncan change with your page layout.\n\n362\n00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:45.720\nYour margins, margins is where,\nmaybe if I made the margins a little less,\n\n363\n00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.280\na little bit more, and what are first\nof all, what are the margins?\n\n364\n00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:53.137\nThe margins are the white area around\nthe edges of your printed page, and\n\n365\n00:19:53.137 --> 00:19:54.578\nyou can change that.\n\n366\n00:19:54.578 --> 00:19:59.571\nAnd maybe you have certain specifications\nwhere you always have to have one-inch\n\n367\n00:19:59.571 --> 00:20:01.610\nmargins all around on your page.\n\n368\n00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:05.090\nAnd I'm thinking more like Word,\nbut maybe you have special paper.\n\n369\n00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:09.046\nMaybe you have letterhead paper that\nyou're going to be printing this out, and\n\n370\n00:20:09.046 --> 00:20:12.845\nyou need to make sure that you have\na two-inch clearance on that top margin.\n\n371\n00:20:12.845 --> 00:20:15.230\nSo you don't print over the stationary or\n\n372\n00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:18.400\nthe letterheads that you\nhave already pre-printed.\n\n373\n00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.610\nSo there is a whole bunch of reasons\nwhy you'd want to modify your margins.\n\n374\n00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:27.270\nTo fit more, fit less, or\ndo your letterhead, so\n\n375\n00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:29.470\nwe've got here with our margins.\n\n376\n00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:33.840\nRight now it's on our normal, which is\nour three-quarters inch all around,\n\n377\n00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.760\nbut then your left and right are 0.7.\n\n378\n00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:40.020\nThen I could go ahead and\ndo my wide margins,\n\n379\n00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:43.000\nand see where it's going to\ngive more of that white space.\n\n380\n00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.370\nBut because I have my scaling on there,\n\n381\n00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:49.700\nit's shrinking everything down for\nall the columns.\n\n382\n00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:53.760\nI'm not gonna get any adjustment\nof the content going on or\n\n383\n00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.330\noff on to the next page.\n\n384\n00:20:55.330 --> 00:21:00.260\nSo just keep that in mind, that I did\nthe scale first and then the margin.\n\n385\n00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.209\nIf you're doing margin before the scale,\n\n386\n00:21:02.209 --> 00:21:04.498\nit might adjust things\na little bit differently.\n\n387\n00:21:04.498 --> 00:21:09.604\nBut that two-inch custom header, or\ncustom margin, sorry, it's not a header.\n\n388\n00:21:09.604 --> 00:21:14.644\n[LAUGH] I can come into the custom\nmargins, and then I can specify that\n\n389\n00:21:14.644 --> 00:21:20.460\nI need a two inch margin on the top,\nand that's where I need it to be.\n\n390\n00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:25.086\nAnd then I click OK, and notice that it\ndrops everything down to that two inch\n\n391\n00:21:25.086 --> 00:21:27.273\nmark, which is pretty fantastic.\n\n392\n00:21:27.273 --> 00:21:30.044\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; So there's a lot of things that you can\n\n393\n00:21:30.044 --> 00:21:33.499\ndo right from within your\nprint preview dialogue box,\n\n394\n00:21:33.499 --> 00:21:36.670\nto go ahead and\nchange the different variations.\n\n395\n00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:40.470\nNow remember that button behind my head\nthat I was talking about like, well.\n\n396\n00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:44.660\nWhat about if I wanted to just kind\nof visually change the margins?\n\n397\n00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:48.426\nMaybe the numerical values aren't\nreally doing anything for me.\n\n398\n00:21:48.426 --> 00:21:51.326\nWell, if you click this button down here,\n\n399\n00:21:51.326 --> 00:21:54.560\nit's gonna show you where\nthose margins live.\n\n400\n00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:55.127\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n401\n00:21:55.127 --> 00:21:58.682\nthat's where you can drag them left and\nright or up and down,\n\n402\n00:21:58.682 --> 00:22:02.390\nto be able to kind of visually\nfit the information on your page.\n\n403\n00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:06.662\nNow, with this,\nwe don't have a lot going on in here.\n\n404\n00:22:06.662 --> 00:22:09.694\nBut think about if you had 60,000 rows or\n\n405\n00:22:09.694 --> 00:22:13.780\njust a couple that are just kinda\nhanging off on the next page.\n\n406\n00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:15.950\nYou could adjust the margins here, now,\n\n407\n00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:18.330\nwhy did they have like two\nof them right down here?\n\n408\n00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:21.980\nBecause you do need to accommodate for\nheaders and footers,\n\n409\n00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.640\nwhich we will be getting\ninto in just a little bit.\n\n410\n00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:29.225\nBut notice when I hover over these lines,\nlet's go back up to this top one.\n\n411\n00:22:29.225 --> 00:22:33.923\nYou get a line with two pointed arrows\non there, I could take this and\n\n412\n00:22:33.923 --> 00:22:39.539\ndrag this up, and then just change this\nvisually to where I want my margins to go.\n\n413\n00:22:39.539 --> 00:22:43.090\nAgain, remember, I have that scale,\nthat's why it's adjusting,\n\n414\n00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:46.658\nthat doesn't happen automatically\nif you don't have that scale on.\n\n415\n00:22:46.658 --> 00:22:50.274\nSo making my margins by dragging those all\n\n416\n00:22:50.274 --> 00:22:54.210\nfrom within the print\npreview dialogue box.\n\n417\n00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:57.630\nOr I could say this is really\nthe backstage view still, so\n\n418\n00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:02.600\nthe dialogue box would be,\nif I scroll down, would be the page setup.\n\n419\n00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.240\nAnd when I click on page setup,\nI can change all those.\n\n420\n00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:09.659\nCuz now if I look at my margins,\nokay, it's 1.87, and 1.76.\n\n421\n00:23:09.659 --> 00:23:13.445\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's just from where I dragged\n\n422\n00:23:13.445 --> 00:23:15.064\neverything around.\n\n423\n00:23:15.064 --> 00:23:18.100\nAnd you can change your center, on the\npage, which is kind of a big thing for me.\n\n424\n00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:20.650\nI kinda like to have things\nvertically centered a lot of times.\n\n425\n00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:22.630\nSo I if I choose that vertically centered,\n\n426\n00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:27.510\nnotice that it's gonna jump down into\nthe vertical center of the page.\n\n427\n00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:30.680\nAnd that’s where my margins,\nreally the left and\n\n428\n00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.910\nright margins are going to be the biggest\npart that I need to worry about.\n\n429\n00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:39.602\nAll right, so headers and footers, we can\nstill do this from this print preview and\n\n430\n00:23:39.602 --> 00:23:44.094\nthis backstage view, but\nyou just don't have a dropdown for it.\n\n431\n00:23:44.094 --> 00:23:49.298\nBut you do have that dialogue box in\nthe page setup to where you can come\n\n432\n00:23:49.298 --> 00:23:54.251\ninto our header and footer, now,\nwhat are headers and footers?\n\n433\n00:23:54.251 --> 00:23:58.263\nThey're things that go on the top of\nthe page, and the things that go on\n\n434\n00:23:58.263 --> 00:24:02.151\nthe bottom of the page, and\nthey will repeat on every printed page.\n\n435\n00:24:02.151 --> 00:24:07.693\nSo if I had six pages, It's gonna\nprint on all six of those pages.\n\n436\n00:24:07.693 --> 00:24:12.289\nBut one thing from doing it from this\nparticular dialog box is you don't\n\n437\n00:24:12.289 --> 00:24:15.280\nreally see it until you click OK.\n\n438\n00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:20.810\nSo you kinda have to do it, click OK\nif you wanna preview it right here,\n\n439\n00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:23.150\nthen come back into the dialog box and\nkeep on going.\n\n440\n00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:29.190\nNow, the headers and footers,\nyou have three specific areas.\n\n441\n00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:32.680\nYou have the left,\nthe center, and the right.\n\n442\n00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.270\nIn Word, we talked about these\nwith tab stops and everything, but\n\n443\n00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:37.340\nsince we're not in Word, you're like,\nI don't care what's in Word.\n\n444\n00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.260\nWell, I mean, not that you don't care.\n\n445\n00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:43.360\nBut I'm just trying to correlate to\nsomething you might have already done.\n\n446\n00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:46.850\nYou don't have to worry about tab stops\nhere cuz they actually compartmentalize\n\n447\n00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:47.760\nit for you.\n\n448\n00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:52.960\nWatch, maybe I want to have on my header,\nI clicked on the custom header button,\n\n449\n00:24:52.960 --> 00:25:00.240\nI would like to have my name,\nthe date, and the file name.\n\n450\n00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.450\nCuz that's would I need to have.\n\n451\n00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:04.450\nThis is something that maybe in\nyou're particular organizations,\n\n452\n00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:06.450\nit's like you always need to\nput the file path in there,\n\n453\n00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:09.210\nyou always need to put the date when\nyou're printing on something because\n\n454\n00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:12.440\nthis is just like for\nthe record that you need to know that\n\n455\n00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:16.890\nanybody that sees this needs to know\nwhen it was done and where it came from.\n\n456\n00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:21.110\nLuckily, you don't have to type that\nout because those are things like\n\n457\n00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:26.060\nproperties of either the document or\nJust the day that happens.\n\n458\n00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:28.990\nSo if I have my flashing\ncursor over here on left, see?\n\n459\n00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:29.820\nNo tab stops.\n\n460\n00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.940\nI can just type in Vonne Smith.\n\n461\n00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:34.680\nAnd I will click in the center.\n\n462\n00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:40.110\nI want the date, but\nI want it to change when the date changes.\n\n463\n00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:42.610\nIf this was for tomorrow,\nthen it would change there.\n\n464\n00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:48.430\nNotice you do have some buttons across the\ntop of what I can choose to put in there.\n\n465\n00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:52.409\nSo you click your cursor in the section\nthat you want to be in, and\n\n466\n00:25:52.409 --> 00:25:57.716\nthen you can click in, insert date,\ninsert time, insert the file path, cool,\n\n467\n00:25:57.716 --> 00:26:02.535\nfile name, sheet name, all sorts of neat\nthings that I could go ahead and do.\n\n468\n00:26:02.535 --> 00:26:04.030\nI'm gonna choose insert date.\n\n469\n00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:08.900\nIt doesn't save the day, it's just\nputting it in that special code that it\n\n470\n00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.890\nknows to put whatever\nthe day is right now.\n\n471\n00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:15.010\nI go to the right, it's kinda hard\nto see if there's a flashing cursor\n\n472\n00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:17.350\ncause it's gonna be right justified.\n\n473\n00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:21.895\nLet's put in that file path and\nwe click OK.\n\n474\n00:26:21.895 --> 00:26:26.560\nAnd you can see from the page setup\nthat that is kind of what it's.\n\n475\n00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:28.280\nIt's kind of like moving all together.\n\n476\n00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:28.930\nThat's okay.\n\n477\n00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:32.180\nClick OK here, and then let's scroll out.\n\n478\n00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:32.780\nSee?\n\n479\n00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:35.000\nIt does come in to the right sections.\n\n480\n00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.832\nIt's not gonna overlap itself.\n\n481\n00:26:36.832 --> 00:26:42.160\nIt was just in that particular dialog box\nthat it wasn't able to see everything.\n\n482\n00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.120\nSo, awesome.\n\n483\n00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.200\nWe can put that to the top.\n\n484\n00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.740\nLet's go back down to that footer.\n\n485\n00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:48.890\nCome back in to our page setup.\n\n486\n00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:50.700\nWe go over to Headers and Footers.\n\n487\n00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:52.130\nIn this sense,\nI only want the page numbers.\n\n488\n00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:53.790\nI don't wanna put anything else special.\n\n489\n00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:56.493\nI don't need to occupy the three spaces.\n\n490\n00:26:56.493 --> 00:27:00.090\nNotice that in both the header and\nthe footer, there's a drop down.\n\n491\n00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:04.070\nAnd in this drop-down, it can choose,\nwell, what do you want to put in there?\n\n492\n00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:08.000\nAnd it's got some ones that like see,\nthere's Page, that's the file name,\n\n493\n00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.640\nthere's the file path.\n\n494\n00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.130\nWeekly Sales Page 1.\n\n495\n00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:14.050\nSo it's giving you some default\nones that maybe you're like,\n\n496\n00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:15.240\nthat's exactly what I need.\n\n497\n00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:18.805\nI need the username,\nwhat page I'm on, and the date.\n\n498\n00:27:18.805 --> 00:27:20.480\nSo you can choose it from the drop-down.\n\n499\n00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:23.379\nYou don't always have to go under\nthe Custom if you wanted to.\n\n500\n00:27:23.379 --> 00:27:27.928\nAnd so for example on this one,\nI would like to just do page one of, and\n\n501\n00:27:27.928 --> 00:27:29.897\nthen however many they have.\n\n502\n00:27:29.897 --> 00:27:33.227\nAnd I click that,\ndrop that down, click OK, boop,\n\n503\n00:27:33.227 --> 00:27:37.264\nthere it is it's right on down\nthere that I have page one of one.\n\n504\n00:27:37.264 --> 00:27:40.965\nNow I only have one page so\nthat's all I've got but\n\n505\n00:27:40.965 --> 00:27:46.621\nif you had more then it would go ahead and\nprint on every single printed page.\n\n506\n00:27:46.621 --> 00:27:47.280\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n507\n00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:48.006\n&gt;&gt; Very nice.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n508\n00:27:48.006 --> 00:27:51.712\n&gt;&gt; And those are all the things that we\ncan do from the print preview dialogue\n\n509\n00:27:51.712 --> 00:27:54.620\nbox, or\nbackstage I keep saying dialogue box.\n\n510\n00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:56.580\nBut the page setup is the dialog box.\n\n511\n00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:01.210\nBut, there's some other things that I\ndo wanna show you with the page layout\n\n512\n00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:03.920\nthat you can do from within\nthe page layout view.\n\n513\n00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:07.170\nAnd then we also have the really\ncool page break view.\n\n514\n00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:10.170\nBut I know you're giving\nme that signal of hey,\n\n515\n00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:13.130\nit's getting time to where\nwe need to wrap up part one.\n\n516\n00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:16.650\nSo you know what we will come\nback with a part two so.\n\n517\n00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:19.070\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, well Excel 2016 Essentials.\n\n518\n00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:21.200\nProof, print, page layout, part one.\n\n519\n00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.340\nThere will be a part two,\nmake sure you watch that.\n\n520\n00:28:23.340

Hi, thank you, thank you, thank you.\n\n10\n00:00:27.647 --> 00:00:29.164\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Please help us.\n\n11\n00:00:29.164 --> 00:00:30.711\nWe're not worthy, we're not worthy.\n\n12\n00:00:30.711 --> 00:00:33.997\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, we're doing an encore.\n\n13\n00:00:33.997 --> 00:00:38.854\nYes, we're doing an encore to go\ninto Part 2 of our page layout.\n\n14\n00:00:38.854 --> 00:00:41.720\nWe've done our proofing,\nwe talked about printing.\n\n15\n00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.399\nAnd we had done everything through\nthe Print Preview backstage view and\n\n16\n00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.760\nwe went into the Page Setup dialogue box.\n\n17\n00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.173\nI kept mixing those up.\n\n18\n00:00:52.173 --> 00:00:56.142\nAnd now I'd like to show you some\ndifferent views and some other ways that\n\n19\n00:00:56.142 --> 00:01:00.394\nyou could do pretty much the same thing\nthat we were just at in a different way.\n\n20\n00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:00.931\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n21\n00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:04.341\n&gt;&gt; The same but different,\ntake another path around Excel.\n\n22\n00:01:04.341 --> 00:01:05.690\n&gt;&gt; So many options in Excel.\n\n23\n00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.623\n&gt;&gt; There is, so why don't we jump back\non down into the same file that we were\n\n24\n00:01:09.623 --> 00:01:10.852\nworking with before?\n\n25\n00:01:10.852 --> 00:01:15.790\nAnd I'm gonna jump over to another\nworksheet for this next example.\n\n26\n00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.485\nBecause I like seeing it in\nthe Print Preview because I\n\n27\n00:01:20.485 --> 00:01:24.667\nsee it as the page is\nactually gonna be printed.\n\n28\n00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:26.540\nSo I prefer that way.\n\n29\n00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.250\nAnd they also didn't really\nhave these particular\n\n30\n00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.420\nviews back in the day when I was\ndoing Excel and teaching it.\n\n31\n00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.095\nSo it's kind of like you\nget it in their patterns.\n\n32\n00:01:38.095 --> 00:01:41.180\nAnd you get like this is the way I go to\nit even though like, no, go this way.\n\n33\n00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.813\nLike, no, no, no.\n\n34\n00:01:41.813 --> 00:01:43.002\nI can still get to it this way.\n\n35\n00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:44.063\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n36\n00:01:44.063 --> 00:01:45.258\n&gt;&gt; So it's all to each of them.\n\n37\n00:01:45.258 --> 00:01:46.405\n&gt;&gt; Options, options, options.\n\n38\n00:01:46.405 --> 00:01:49.510\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, we're gonna come\nover here to our View tab.\n\n39\n00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.801\nIn our View tab we have\nour Page Break Preview.\n\n40\n00:01:53.801 --> 00:01:55.995\nAnd before I click it,\njust to show you and remind you,\n\n41\n00:01:55.995 --> 00:01:58.599\ncuz we did go over this a little\nbit in some of our introductions.\n\n42\n00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:03.046\nTo where if I zoom out of here,\nno that's the wrong way,\n\n43\n00:02:03.046 --> 00:02:05.422\nlet's go ahead and zoom out.\n\n44\n00:02:05.422 --> 00:02:09.428\nI'm seeing this normally, and I can\nsee all the grids and the guides, and\n\n45\n00:02:09.428 --> 00:02:11.307\nit's just a big old spread sheet.\n\n46\n00:02:11.307 --> 00:02:15.053\nNow these little dots that\nare coming along by the way,\n\n47\n00:02:15.053 --> 00:02:18.893\nthese little dotted lines,\nthose are you page breaks.\n\n48\n00:02:18.893 --> 00:02:22.004\nCuz remember, when soon as you go and\ndo a Print Preview, and\n\n49\n00:02:22.004 --> 00:02:26.274\nyou come back to normal view, you'll\nalways see where's it's dividing this up.\n\n50\n00:02:26.274 --> 00:02:27.806\nBut I wasn't on this worksheet.\n\n51\n00:02:27.806 --> 00:02:31.372\nBe we had chose that to change,\nwe did that into the workbook,\n\n52\n00:02:31.372 --> 00:02:35.228\nShow Workbook of what to be printed,\nbut that's why we have them.\n\n53\n00:02:35.228 --> 00:02:36.909\nSo just to remind you about that.\n\n54\n00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.890\nAnd if I go into the, no, Page Layout.\n\n55\n00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.363\n[LAUGH] Wrong one,\nthis is the one I wanna tell you about.\n\n56\n00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:44.135\nLook at this.\n\n57\n00:02:44.135 --> 00:02:49.750\nIt actually shows you each\npage that you're going to see.\n\n58\n00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.270\nLet me zoom out on this\na little bit more too.\n\n59\n00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.450\nSo you can see, okay,\nnow I can see where they're going.\n\n60\n00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.645\nThat's really zoomed out.\n\n61\n00:02:55.645 --> 00:02:56.700\n&gt;&gt; Woo hoo.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n62\n00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.220\n&gt;&gt; But it's kind of like Word.\n\n63\n00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.259\nIn Word you have okay here's the page and\nthen you see where each header and\n\n64\n00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:04.116\nfooter lives.\n\n65\n00:03:04.116 --> 00:03:06.050\nAnd so\nyou can change everything from here.\n\n66\n00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.848\nIt's just another way of looking at it so\nif I wanted to add a header and\n\n67\n00:03:09.848 --> 00:03:14.121\nnotice there is one, two, three,\nthere is three different places in here.\n\n68\n00:03:14.121 --> 00:03:19.310\nIf I click on the left hand side,\nI will, well I won't zoom in just yet.\n\n69\n00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.632\nBut notice that I get\na contextual tab that comes up.\n\n70\n00:03:23.632 --> 00:03:28.502\nAll those little buttons that we saw in\nthe insert or doing the header and footer,\n\n71\n00:03:28.502 --> 00:03:32.081\nwhere we could insert the date,\nor insert the file path, or\n\n72\n00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:33.809\nany other things like that.\n\n73\n00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:36.512\nThey're all up here too,\nthey're just a little bit bigger, and\n\n74\n00:03:36.512 --> 00:03:37.900\nthey actually gave you the name.\n\n75\n00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.650\nSo if I wanted to put in the current date,\nand\n\n76\n00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.540\nthen click over to the right and\nput in the file path, that's what I want.\n\n77\n00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.370\nI can then go to the footer from here.\n\n78\n00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.120\nAnd then I could choose to\ninsert the number of pages.\n\n79\n00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.681\nI should actually put, in front of that I\nshould put page and then number of pages.\n\n80\n00:03:58.681 --> 00:04:04.153\nAnd then if I close out of this and\nhow do I get out of the header and footer?\n\n81\n00:04:04.153 --> 00:04:07.659\nIf you just click in to another\narea of the document or\n\n82\n00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:09.580\nin this case a spreadsheet.\n\n83\n00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.225\nThen it takes that contextual tab away and\n\n84\n00:04:12.225 --> 00:04:16.241\nI can see, I actually kinda\nchanged that number [INAUDIBLE].\n\n85\n00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:19.332\nSorry, that was a little messed up, so\nI'm gonna go ahead and delete that out.\n\n86\n00:04:19.332 --> 00:04:21.868\nAnd then I can come into these drop-downs.\n\n87\n00:04:21.868 --> 00:04:25.873\nRemember, those drop-downs\nthat give you those defaults,\n\n88\n00:04:25.873 --> 00:04:29.540\nI can choose page one of,\nand then it changes there.\n\n89\n00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.430\nAnd now if I click off of this, it's\ngonna go ahead and change, there it go.\n\n90\n00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.976\nIt went ahead and updated itself.\n\n91\n00:04:34.976 --> 00:04:40.061\nSo just a different way of being\nable to control your page layout.\n\n92\n00:04:40.061 --> 00:04:43.397\nYou also have on that page layout tab,\n\n93\n00:04:43.397 --> 00:04:48.270\nwhether you're in the Page Layout View or\nnot.\n\n94\n00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.700\nThese are not connected.\n\n95\n00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.452\nI can come in and\nchange my margins to do a wide margin.\n\n96\n00:04:54.452 --> 00:04:58.267\nI could change the page\norientation to landscape.\n\n97\n00:04:58.267 --> 00:05:01.075\nAgain, if I could do\nthis all in normal view.\n\n98\n00:05:01.075 --> 00:05:04.230\nSo I can come and\nchange all of these different options.\n\n99\n00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.586\nIt's just that in normal view, if I\nwent and changed that to portrait versus\n\n100\n00:05:08.586 --> 00:05:12.342\nlandscape or change the margins,\nyou're not seeing anything.\n\n101\n00:05:12.342 --> 00:05:17.290\nCuz it's in normal view, you're not\ngonna be doing that, page layout.\n\n102\n00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.891\nSo those are the two, that's why\nthey kind of correlate together.\n\n103\n00:05:20.891 --> 00:05:24.818\nIf you wanna see it,\ngo into that Page Layout View and\n\n104\n00:05:24.818 --> 00:05:29.910\nsee all the changes you're\nmaking in that Page Layout tab.\n\n105\n00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.514\nYou can change the size of your paper and\nso on and so forth.\n\n106\n00:05:33.514 --> 00:05:38.270\nAnd there's a couple of other things\nthat are in this particular tab that you\n\n107\n00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.303\ndon't really see in the page setup\ndialog box in Print Preview.\n\n108\n00:05:42.303 --> 00:05:43.932\nPut a background image on there.\n\n109\n00:05:43.932 --> 00:05:46.960\nNow you don't have the same flexibility\n\n110\n00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.155\nof putting in a watermarked\nimage like you have in Word.\n\n111\n00:05:51.155 --> 00:05:55.705\nCuz if I wanted to put a background and\nlet's go onto a file on my computer which\n\n112\n00:05:55.705 --> 00:05:58.928\nlists, we gotta put up Fuego\nin his cute little hat.\n\n113\n00:05:58.928 --> 00:06:01.050\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; God, that's a little.\n\n114\n00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.830\nHe's all over the place.\n\n115\n00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.714\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, he's in cells.\n\n116\n00:06:03.714 --> 00:06:04.510\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n117\n00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.819\n&gt;&gt; He doesn't, I can't really scale it.\n\n118\n00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:10.713\nI can't do the transparency of it so\n\n119\n00:06:10.713 --> 00:06:15.350\nthis is where it doesn't have\nall the same flexibility.\n\n120\n00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.640\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; As Word and things like that.\n\n121\n00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.075\nBut I do now have Delete Background cuz,\nsorry Mr. Fuego Pants you gotta go.\n\n122\n00:06:23.075 --> 00:06:24.772\n[LAUGH] So we're gonna take him out.\n\n123\n00:06:24.772 --> 00:06:25.804\nAnd there's a few other ones.\n\n124\n00:06:25.804 --> 00:06:28.811\nAnd we'll talk about print titles and\nprint areas in just a second.\n\n125\n00:06:28.811 --> 00:06:33.240\nBut one thing that is a good\none is right over here.\n\n126\n00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.270\nThe print, print grid lines.\n\n127\n00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.940\nRemember, back in the format of,\nI think it's format of workbook.\n\n128\n00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.925\nWe talked about shading and borders to\nwhere somebody, I remember people would\n\n129\n00:06:43.925 --> 00:06:48.042\nsay like, it's not showing me the borders,\nit's not showing me the grid lines.\n\n130\n00:06:48.042 --> 00:06:52.397\nAnd I'm like cuz if I do a File &gt; Print,\nyou're not seeing the divisions of\n\n131\n00:06:52.397 --> 00:06:56.499\nwhere you have where the cells are,\nwhere the columns and rows intersect.\n\n132\n00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:59.004\nSo I said just go ahead and\nthrow on some borders, but\n\n133\n00:06:59.004 --> 00:07:02.623\nin essence you could actually print the\ngrid lines, if I just choose this option.\n\n134\n00:07:02.623 --> 00:07:04.876\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna ask that too,\ncan you print the grid lines?\n\n135\n00:07:04.876 --> 00:07:07.133\n&gt;&gt; Well, there you go,\nlook at that, you can.\n\n136\n00:07:07.133 --> 00:07:12.131\nAnd if I do a file Ctrl P,\nnow I'm seeing that I do actually see\n\n137\n00:07:12.131 --> 00:07:15.954\nthe division so\nit doesn't always have to be.\n\n138\n00:07:15.954 --> 00:07:17.440\nPut the borders on it.\n\n139\n00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.648\nJust tell it to print the grid lines.\n\n140\n00:07:19.648 --> 00:07:20.391\nThat's where you could go.\n\n141\n00:07:20.391 --> 00:07:21.456\n&gt;&gt; That's all you have to do.\n\n142\n00:07:21.456 --> 00:07:24.738\n&gt;&gt; And since we're right\nhere in the Print Preview,\n\n143\n00:07:24.738 --> 00:07:29.126\nI do want to show you can do it from\nthat dialog box in the Page Setup.\n\n144\n00:07:29.126 --> 00:07:33.086\nThe page setup is on the sheet tab,\nand right there it's in the print.\n\n145\n00:07:33.086 --> 00:07:34.861\nSo this isn't like a specific,\n\n146\n00:07:34.861 --> 00:07:38.640\nyou can only get to it on that\nparticular page layout tab.\n\n147\n00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:39.580\nYou can get to it.\n\n148\n00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:44.334\nI just didn't point that out because\nI think the check box is a little\n\n149\n00:07:44.334 --> 00:07:47.596\neasier to see in that\npage layout tab of print.\n\n150\n00:07:47.596 --> 00:07:49.681\nAnd you can also print\nthe headings if you wanted to.\n\n151\n00:07:49.681 --> 00:07:56.025\nYou could put in those columns like A,\nB, C and then the rows and everything.\n\n152\n00:07:56.025 --> 00:07:59.052\nSo you can change that there.\n\n153\n00:07:59.052 --> 00:08:04.742\nGreat, so different place to find the same\nthings If you like the Page Layout view,\n\n154\n00:08:04.742 --> 00:08:06.057\nyou could do that.\n\n155\n00:08:06.057 --> 00:08:08.830\nOr if you like the Normal view,\nyou could do it that way, and\n\n156\n00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:10.675\nchange in all your different options.\n\n157\n00:08:10.675 --> 00:08:14.727\nNow, on this Page Layout,\nthere's two things,\n\n158\n00:08:14.727 --> 00:08:19.751\nthere's the Print Area,\nwe haven't talked about that one.\n\n159\n00:08:19.751 --> 00:08:22.114\nWe did talk about Print Selection,\n\n160\n00:08:22.114 --> 00:08:26.996\nwhere if I selected this amount of\ninformation, and then did a Control P,\n\n161\n00:08:26.996 --> 00:08:31.040\nor a File, Print,\nI could choose it to print the selection.\n\n162\n00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:35.576\nAnd then use my scaling, if I needed to,\nto where I wanna fit all the columns\n\n163\n00:08:35.576 --> 00:08:40.560\non there and everything fits, cool, but\nthere is something that is a print area.\n\n164\n00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.874\nNow a print area is something\nthat you're kind of,\n\n165\n00:08:43.874 --> 00:08:48.940\nyou're locking it down, you don't\nwant to have to change the options.\n\n166\n00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:54.512\nIf I select this amount of space and\nthen go to Print Area,\n\n167\n00:08:54.512 --> 00:08:59.169\nand set this as my print area,\nit defines that.\n\n168\n00:08:59.169 --> 00:09:03.070\nIt actually puts it in the name box\nright here, this is the print area.\n\n169\n00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:04.732\n&gt;&gt; Ah-ha.\n&gt;&gt; I'm going click off to here,\n\n170\n00:09:04.732 --> 00:09:07.708\nI'm gonna go over to File,\nI'm gonna go to Print, and\n\n171\n00:09:07.708 --> 00:09:10.128\nnotice that all this\nis still on Selection.\n\n172\n00:09:10.128 --> 00:09:13.932\nIf I choose Active Sheets,\nthat's not the active sheet, is it?\n\n173\n00:09:13.932 --> 00:09:16.286\nIt's the print area.\n\n174\n00:09:16.286 --> 00:09:17.180\n&gt;&gt; Print area.\n\n175\n00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.902\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nit's the print area that I told it to be.\n\n176\n00:09:19.902 --> 00:09:25.172\nSo this is, it's an overriding setting\nthat it's like any time that I'm\n\n177\n00:09:25.172 --> 00:09:30.198\non this sheet, this is the area\nthat you're going to print, always.\n\n178\n00:09:30.198 --> 00:09:34.324\nAnd that's why, in this drop down,\nthere's an option now for, no,\n\n179\n00:09:34.324 --> 00:09:38.008\nI don't wanna, I don't want that\nprint area, I wanna ignore it.\n\n180\n00:09:38.008 --> 00:09:42.330\nSo, if you do have set print\nareas you need to make sure that\n\n181\n00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:46.828\nyou know how to turn it off,\nif you don't want it to be there,\n\n182\n00:09:46.828 --> 00:09:52.180\nwithin the print, or the print preview,\nand then you can ignore it.\n\n183\n00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:52.804\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n184\n00:09:52.804 --> 00:09:57.569\n&gt;&gt; The other thing is, if you don't want\nthat to be in there anymore, like stop\n\n185\n00:09:57.569 --> 00:10:02.870\ndesignating this area, in that drop down,\nnow you can see, now I can clear it.\n\n186\n00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:06.268\nOr if you needed to add more information\ninto that, you could go ahead and\n\n187\n00:10:06.268 --> 00:10:07.950\nselect it and add to the print area.\n\n188\n00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:12.729\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nclear it, and now I've taken all\n\n189\n00:10:12.729 --> 00:10:17.640\nthose settings out, so\nthat's what a print area is in Excel.\n\n190\n00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.537\nNow, Print Titles, I love these things.\n\n191\n00:10:19.537 --> 00:10:22.492\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I will show you, if I do a File,\n\n192\n00:10:22.492 --> 00:10:24.232\na Print Preview, you know what?\n\n193\n00:10:24.232 --> 00:10:27.706\nSorry, let me just change a few things,\nI'm gonna turn off the grid lines,\n\n194\n00:10:27.706 --> 00:10:31.240\ncuz they're a little distracting, and\nI will now do a print preview here.\n\n195\n00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:35.459\nI'm going to just zoom the page in\na little bit, and I can see that\n\n196\n00:10:35.459 --> 00:10:40.240\neverything's fitting right now,\ncuz I have all my columns on one page.\n\n197\n00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:45.880\nOkay, well, that's good, okay,\nand this is my active sheet.\n\n198\n00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:49.910\nSo if I scroll on down,\nthis is, well, you know what?\n\n199\n00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:55.747\nThis shouldn't all fit, let's try this\nagain, so we have here we're going to,\n\n200\n00:10:55.747 --> 00:11:01.445\nwell, let me clear out the print area,\nthe page size is the letter, all right?\n\n201\n00:11:01.445 --> 00:11:05.100\n&gt;&gt;

It's just trying to help you.\n\n205\n00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:14.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It is, the reason is cuz\nI have it in the portrait view.\n\n206\n00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:16.796\n&gt;&gt; Ah-ha.\n&gt;&gt;

The mid.\n\n263\n00:14:40.944 --> 00:14:42.338\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I almost said\n\n264\n00:14:42.338 --> 00:14:43.185\nthe left.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n265\n00:14:43.185 --> 00:14:44.736\n&gt;&gt; Right, we want to sort it A to Z,\n\n266\n00:14:44.736 --> 00:14:48.790\nyou click it and it sorts everything,\nand everybody's like, the whole thing.\n\n267\n00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:52.081\nThe whole contiguous range,\nthis did not just sort that one column,\n\n268\n00:14:52.081 --> 00:14:53.054\nit sorted all of it.\n\n269\n00:14:53.054 --> 00:14:54.314\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n270\n00:14:54.314 --> 00:14:58.268\n&gt;&gt; Woo, so in this Team Colors,\nyou see it goes Blue, then Green,\n\n271\n00:14:58.268 --> 00:14:59.820\nthen Red, then Yellow.\n\n272\n00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:05.385\nIf I print this, it's just gonna go\nahead and make my automatic page breaks.\n\n273\n00:15:05.385 --> 00:15:06.460\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n274\n00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:10.787\n&gt;&gt; I want it to break at every change in\nTeam Color, so Team Blue is on one page,\n\n275\n00:15:10.787 --> 00:15:12.600\nTeam Green is on another page.\n\n276\n00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.372\nSo I need to manually say,\n\n277\n00:15:15.372 --> 00:15:21.000\nbreak the page here,\na couple ways to do this.\n\n278\n00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:28.496\nI know that right here Blue is row 17,\nso that's the last row on page one.\n\n279\n00:15:28.496 --> 00:15:32.137\nRow 18,\nthis is where I want to start my new page,\n\n280\n00:15:32.137 --> 00:15:35.150\nthat's what I where the page break to be.\n\n281\n00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:40.125\nSo if you select the row, and\nthen go to your Page Layout,\n\n282\n00:15:40.125 --> 00:15:43.970\ngo to Breaks, and say, Insert Page Break.\n\n283\n00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:48.492\nI have put in, I'm gonna click off to it,\nI know that there's a page break there,\n\n284\n00:15:48.492 --> 00:15:50.670\nbecause there's a solid line across.\n\n285\n00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:54.486\nNot a dotted line, the dotted lines\nare the automatic page breaks.\n\n286\n00:15:54.486 --> 00:15:58.925\nSo, I'm saying, break here,\nawesome, let's scroll on down.\n\n287\n00:15:58.925 --> 00:16:00.268\nThe other thing is,\n\n288\n00:16:00.268 --> 00:16:05.245\nyou don't have to actually select\nthe row If I select here, this so I34,\n\n289\n00:16:05.245 --> 00:16:10.475\ncuz I know that this is gonna a new place\nwhere I would like to have my page start.\n\n290\n00:16:10.475 --> 00:16:13.010\nSo you guys have to say like\nthis is the start of the page.\n\n291\n00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:16.898\nAlso a way to think about it is\nlike the page is gonna go above it.\n\n292\n00:16:16.898 --> 00:16:19.035\nSo either way you wanna think of it.\n\n293\n00:16:19.035 --> 00:16:23.689\nGet that, click on the break,\ninsert page break and it's gonna do that.\n\n294\n00:16:23.689 --> 00:16:26.475\nYou don't have to select the whole row.\n\n295\n00:16:26.475 --> 00:16:30.885\nAnd if I do a file Ctrl+P,\nnotice that over here,\n\n296\n00:16:30.885 --> 00:16:34.254\nthere is blue and then if I go to green.\n\n297\n00:16:34.254 --> 00:16:38.491\nNow red and yellow are together right\nnow cuz I haven't done their page break.\n\n298\n00:16:38.491 --> 00:16:45.213\nCuz I wanna show you another way, yet\nanother way, of making your page breaks.\n\n299\n00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:49.170\nYou can go into Page Break Preview.\n\n300\n00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:53.377\nI do like this one, because it gives you\na little bit more visual recognition,\n\n301\n00:16:53.377 --> 00:16:55.820\nif you wanna say,\nof where I want these to go.\n\n302\n00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:57.273\nDo my page break preview.\n\n303\n00:16:57.273 --> 00:17:02.695\nI'm gonna zoom out a little bit,\nso we can go down.\n\n304\n00:17:02.695 --> 00:17:03.995\nWe'll go to like 50.\n\n305\n00:17:03.995 --> 00:17:07.096\nWell maybe we'll go a little smaller,\nso let's go ahead and zoom out there.\n\n306\n00:17:07.096 --> 00:17:09.719\nSo you can see that I've\ngot all the information.\n\n307\n00:17:09.719 --> 00:17:14.554\nAnd everywhere where there's blue line,\nwhether it's manual or\n\n308\n00:17:14.554 --> 00:17:17.413\nautomatic, I can go ahead and drag it.\n\n309\n00:17:17.413 --> 00:17:18.515\nYou can barely see it,\n\n310\n00:17:18.515 --> 00:17:22.348\nbut there are two pointed arrows when I\nhover over those like thick blue lines.\n\n311\n00:17:22.348 --> 00:17:29.129\nAnd I can pull this down, to break\nthe pages, where I want them to be broken.\n\n312\n00:17:29.129 --> 00:17:33.276\nCuz maybe I wanna like distribute\nit equally, like in three,\n\n313\n00:17:33.276 --> 00:17:35.688\ninstead of four pages or two pages.\n\n314\n00:17:35.688 --> 00:17:37.638\nI can change it there.\n\n315\n00:17:37.638 --> 00:17:40.089\nI can see that I've got one there.\n\n316\n00:17:40.089 --> 00:17:43.617\nIt's hard to see where my teams break.\n\n317\n00:17:43.617 --> 00:17:45.290\nI can see it there.\n\n318\n00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:49.713\nBut now again, I'm back into here\nwhere I need another page break.\n\n319\n00:17:49.713 --> 00:17:51.861\nI can still go ahead and select the cells.\n\n320\n00:17:51.861 --> 00:17:55.913\nAnd insert the page break here,\nto get another one.\n\n321\n00:17:55.913 --> 00:17:59.889\nAnd it could just be random, it wouldn't\neven have to be like where I want the,\n\n322\n00:17:59.889 --> 00:18:04.130\nlike where the information stops, because\nI can visually change where this goes.\n\n323\n00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:09.054\nAnd now I can move them up and down so,\nI really like page break preview.\n\n324\n00:18:09.054 --> 00:18:14.060\nIt shows me everything, and\nI can adjust it as I need to.\n\n325\n00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:14.894\n&gt;&gt; That is wonderful.\n\n326\n00:18:14.894 --> 00:18:15.556\n&gt;&gt; Like that.\n\n327\n00:18:15.556 --> 00:18:18.958\nI'm gonna go back to normal for\nnow, because what if I did all\n\n328\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:22.175\nthese page breaks and\nI was like ugh, I don't like that.\n\n329\n00:18:22.175 --> 00:18:27.309\nCan we just go back to just automatically\nbreaking the page where Excel\n\n330\n00:18:27.309 --> 00:18:32.276\nsees like this is the stop of page one,\npage two, so on and so forth.\n\n331\n00:18:32.276 --> 00:18:36.558\nCuz when you make page breaks, manual\npage breaks, you can also clear them.\n\n332\n00:18:36.558 --> 00:18:37.164\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n333\n00:18:37.164 --> 00:18:39.869\n&gt;&gt; You can clear them one at a time,\nor you can clear them all together.\n\n334\n00:18:39.869 --> 00:18:46.952\nIn the page layout tab in the breaks,\nnotice it does say reset all page breaks.\n\n335\n00:18:46.952 --> 00:18:49.646\nOkay, that would well, remove all of them.\n\n336\n00:18:49.646 --> 00:18:50.946\nThey're gonna reset everything.\n\n337\n00:18:50.946 --> 00:18:55.736\nBut if I didn't want this particular\npage break, let's say like between\n\n338\n00:18:55.736 --> 00:19:00.603\nthe green and the red, as long as you\nput your cursor somewhere in a cell that\n\n339\n00:19:00.603 --> 00:19:05.330\nit indicates the next page, you could\nremove and watch that solid line.\n\n340\n00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:09.912\nEspecially over here, if I remove\nthe page break see then it goes away, and\n\n341\n00:19:09.912 --> 00:19:14.083\nthen it goes back to just using\nthe default automatic with the dots.\n\n342\n00:19:14.083 --> 00:19:14.594\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n343\n00:19:14.594 --> 00:19:19.850\n&gt;&gt; So that's, taking one specifically\nout versus taking all of them out and\n\n344\n00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:23.409\nletting it reflow and\npaginate as it needs to see,\n\n345\n00:19:23.409 --> 00:19:26.884\nbased on my margins and\nbased on my orientation,\n\n346\n00:19:26.884 --> 00:19:31.847\nmy portrait versus my landscape,\nand taking all that into account.\n\n347\n00:19:31.847 --> 00:19:34.215\nAnd be able to print that out.\n\n348\n00:19:34.215 --> 00:19:39.265\nSo, that I believe yep covers\neverything that I think you could do.\n\n349\n00:19:39.265 --> 00:19:40.821\n&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]\n&gt;&gt; There's probably another way\n\n350\n00:19:40.821 --> 00:19:41.344\nof doing something.\n\n351\n00:19:41.344 --> 00:19:43.755\nCuz there's always multiple ways.\n\n352\n00:19:43.755 --> 00:19:45.795\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; That I might not have covered but\n\n353\n00:19:45.795 --> 00:19:49.412\nthose are all the ones that I have used,\nand I have used frequently, and\n\n354\n00:19:49.412 --> 00:19:53.336\nhopefully have shown you something to\nwhere you've attached yourself to and\n\n355\n00:19:53.336 --> 00:19:55.168\nbe like, I'm gonna do it that way.\n\n356\n00:19:55.168 --> 00:19:57.768\nAnd now you know how to\ncontrol your page layout.\n\n357\n00:19:57.768 --> 00:20:01.876\n&gt;&gt; Vonne, you're a wonderful teacher and\nproof print page layout and\n\n358\n00:20:01.876 --> 00:20:04.119\nthat is Excel 2016 Essentials.\n\n359\n00:20:04.119 --> 00:20:06.847\nThis is part two, there was a part one,\nmake sure you watch that.\n\n360\n00:20:06.847 --> 00:20:11.422\nAnd watch every single video in\nthe Excel 2016 Essentials library,\n\n361\n00:20:11.422 --> 00:20:13.152\nyou'll be so glad you did!\n\n362\n00:20:13.152 --> 00:20:15.613\nAnd thank you for watching OfficeProTV.\n\n363\n00:20:15.613 --> 00:20:18.156\nRemember a good Office\npro is always learning.\n\n364\n00:20:18.156 --> 00:20:19.142\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n365\n00:20:19.142 --> 00:20:20.036\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah, there's a little box there\nthat said, you do this permanent, gone.\n\n173\n00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:17.181\nNo coming back from the dead [LAUGH].\n\n174\n00:08:17.181 --> 00:08:20.437\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah and\nyou can see up here, our undo button,\n\n175\n00:08:20.437 --> 00:08:23.180\nit's not even allowing me to go backwards.\n\n176\n00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.840\nSo everything that I have done so\nfar is permanent.\n\n177\n00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.881\nI'm doing ctrl, that means the coloring,\n\n178\n00:08:29.881 --> 00:08:34.660\nthe renaming of the worksheets,\nthe deleting, that, it's done.\n\n179\n00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:39.589\nSo just know that when you say this, now\nthe thing you could do is close the file,\n\n180\n00:08:39.589 --> 00:08:44.311\nand not save the changes, and it will\nredo itself, but just know that undo-\n\n181\n00:08:44.311 --> 00:08:45.325\n&gt;&gt; Depending on how far, or\n\n182\n00:08:45.325 --> 00:08:47.705\nhow much work you've done,\nthat might not be practical.\n\n183\n00:08:47.705 --> 00:08:48.313\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n184\n00:08:48.313 --> 00:08:53.059\nYeah, this is a no undo, which is weird,\ncuz it's all ways, don't worry about it,\n\n185\n00:08:53.059 --> 00:08:55.818\nyou can all ways undo,\nunless you do this one [LAUGH].\n\n186\n00:08:55.818 --> 00:09:00.820\n&gt;&gt; Man, you just gave me a brilliant idea\nthat, if I was a programmer, maybe I would\n\n187\n00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:05.455\ndevelop a way to where it actually\ncreated a copied file of all the changes,\n\n188\n00:09:05.455 --> 00:09:09.872\nso that if you did permanently do\nsomething you can switch to the copy and\n\n189\n00:09:09.872 --> 00:09:11.444\nit was a one step behind.\n\n190\n00:09:11.444 --> 00:09:12.356\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like a log file.\n\n191\n00:09:12.356 --> 00:09:14.464\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Like version control, like from GitHub.\n\n192\n00:09:14.464 --> 00:09:15.016\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there you go, yeah.\n\n193\n00:09:15.016 --> 00:09:17.123\n&gt;&gt; Like Git where you go ahead and\nyou have your branches, and\n\n194\n00:09:17.123 --> 00:09:17.898\nthen you can go back.\n\n195\n00:09:17.898 --> 00:09:19.434\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's fantastic stuff.\n\n196\n00:09:19.434 --> 00:09:22.429\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah, that would be cool [LAUGH].\n\n197\n00:09:22.429 --> 00:09:22.995\n&gt;&gt; It would be cool [LAUGH].\n\n198\n00:09:22.995 --> 00:09:25.834\nIt's probably already done [LAUGH].\n\n199\n00:09:25.834 --> 00:09:29.456\n&gt;&gt; It's funny cuz,\nI don't wanna diverge too much, but\n\n200\n00:09:29.456 --> 00:09:34.810\nthere is a product that you can buy that\nbasically, all the things that you want,\n\n201\n00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:40.579\nExcel, or Word, or any Office product\nto do, they've created this add-on.\n\n202\n00:09:40.579 --> 00:09:43.855\n&gt;&gt; That, it's,\nI wanna make a whole episode on this.\n\n203\n00:09:43.855 --> 00:09:47.697\nBut I think I need to get permission to\neven say the name of the company first!\n\n204\n00:09:47.697 --> 00:09:50.170\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nIt's a little teaser.\n\n205\n00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:51.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a little teaser!\n\n206\n00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:54.690\nI really want to do this cuz everything\nthat, even I still consult the.\n\n207\n00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:57.968\nI don't wanna, and it's like and\nthat keeps coming up.\n\n208\n00:09:57.968 --> 00:09:58.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n209\n00:09:58.960 --> 00:09:59.850\n&gt;&gt; They're telling me something here.\n\n210\n00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:00.436\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n211\n00:10:00.436 --> 00:10:01.893\nI see a pattern happening.\n\n212\n00:10:01.893 --> 00:10:03.043\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And so\n\n213\n00:10:03.043 --> 00:10:06.770\nhopefully I'll be able to share\nthat with you one of these days.\n\n214\n00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:10.230\nAll right,\nnow keeping on moving on with our,\n\n215\n00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:15.260\nkeeping on moving on [LAUGH] with\nour managing, I need a new sheet.\n\n216\n00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.213\nI want to make a blank\nnew worksheet in here.\n\n217\n00:10:18.213 --> 00:10:19.777\nThat's probably what that plus sign means.\n\n218\n00:10:19.777 --> 00:10:21.225\nYep you're right.\n\n219\n00:10:21.225 --> 00:10:23.670\nAdd a new sheet, it adds it right into.\n\n220\n00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:28.415\nNow notice it did add it directly\nafter the active sheet that I was on\n\n221\n00:10:28.415 --> 00:10:30.460\nwhich was the weekly sales.\n\n222\n00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:34.065\nSo it put in sheet three, [LAUGH] even\nthough we thought we got rid of it cuz\n\n223\n00:10:34.065 --> 00:10:36.120\nthat's the next we have a one and a two.\n\n224\n00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.910\nSo you can see that that's\nwhere it has added itself.\n\n225\n00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:43.836\nThe neat thing is here, and we'll just\ndouble-click on this and just say new,\n\n226\n00:10:43.836 --> 00:10:44.960\njust for references.\n\n227\n00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:49.540\nIt doesn't matter where I put this\nbecause I can always reorganize it.\n\n228\n00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:53.390\nOkay, hey, you need to go in front of this\none and you need to go behind that one,\n\n229\n00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:57.531\nrearranging your worksheets, it's almost\ntoo simple, yep you just click, hold,\n\n230\n00:10:57.531 --> 00:10:58.380\nand drag.\n\n231\n00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:02.030\nNow the thing you need to be careful\nabout, here as we take our weekly sales,\n\n232\n00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:03.640\nyou got to look for the triangle.\n\n233\n00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:07.678\nWherever that triangle is, when you\nlet go, that's where it's gonna go.\n\n234\n00:11:07.678 --> 00:11:10.080\nSo, I'm gonna zoom in so\nyou can see this a little bit.\n\n235\n00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.840\nClick, hold, drag, see that triangle?\n\n236\n00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:17.888\nIf I wanted weekly sales to be after\naddresses, find that triangle,\n\n237\n00:11:17.888 --> 00:11:23.034\nlet go, and then that's where that\nnew location of that sheet lives.\n\n238\n00:11:23.034 --> 00:11:28.482\nSo reorganizing your worksheets,\nI wanna put new in front of sheet one,\n\n239\n00:11:28.482 --> 00:11:33.216\nlet go, move sheet one between\naddresses and weekly sales, so\n\n240\n00:11:33.216 --> 00:11:39.230\nyou can see how easy it is to go ahead and\nreorganize the order of your sheet tabs.\n\n241\n00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:42.663\nNow if you get enough, here let me\njust go ahead and a couple more.\n\n242\n00:11:42.663 --> 00:11:45.220\nI was trying to get to a point,\nthere we go.\n\n243\n00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.100\nI've got a whole bunch\nof new sheets in here.\n\n244\n00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.962\nDo you see this little buttons\ndown at the bottom right-hand,\n\n245\n00:11:49.962 --> 00:11:52.241\nthat's the other right,\nthat would be the left.\n\n246\n00:11:52.241 --> 00:11:54.656\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's where you can jump back\n\n247\n00:11:54.656 --> 00:11:56.790\nand forth to the different sheets.\n\n248\n00:11:56.790 --> 00:12:01.896\nSo when you start getting multiple sheets,\nyou can go into those particular\n\n249\n00:12:01.896 --> 00:12:06.438\nones by going back and forth, and\nyou can see the dot, dot dots, and\n\n250\n00:12:06.438 --> 00:12:11.221\nif I clicked that, see, it's gonna\ntake me a little bit further out and\n\n251\n00:12:11.221 --> 00:12:16.777\nI can keep kinda like moving, almost like\nscreenshots, for my multiple sheets.\n\n252\n00:12:16.777 --> 00:12:22.820\nNow, we did learn in another episode\nhow you can select multiple worksheets.\n\n253\n00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:27.721\nSo if I single clicked on sheet 10,\nheld my shift key down to sheet 4,\n\n254\n00:12:27.721 --> 00:12:31.168\nand then I delete all those,\nI can get rid of them.\n\n255\n00:12:31.168 --> 00:12:32.268\nIt didn't even give me\na warning on that one [LAUGH].\n\n256\n00:12:32.268 --> 00:12:33.338\n&gt;&gt; No it did not.\n\n257\n00:12:33.338 --> 00:12:35.477\n&gt;&gt; So be careful about that one.\n\n258\n00:12:35.477 --> 00:12:37.821\nYou definitely need to watch that.\n\n259\n00:12:37.821 --> 00:12:41.764\nSo organizing, reorganizing,\nI'm just gonna kinda look at my notes.\n\n260\n00:12:41.764 --> 00:12:42.780\nWhat do we need to do?\n\n261\n00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:43.877\nWe need to copy.\n\n262\n00:12:43.877 --> 00:12:47.107\nSo here's our weekly sales, and\nmaybe I need to go ahead and\n\n263\n00:12:47.107 --> 00:12:49.380\nmake a whole nother worksheet like this.\n\n264\n00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:52.897\nNow you could go ahead and copy,\nselect all this, copy, make a new sheet-\n\n265\n00:12:52.897 --> 00:12:53.981\n&gt;&gt; New sheet, paste it in.\n\n266\n00:12:53.981 --> 00:12:58.540\n&gt;&gt; You could do it a lot quicker if\nyou just copied the whole worksheet.\n\n267\n00:12:58.540 --> 00:12:59.835\nHow do we do that?\n\n268\n00:12:59.835 --> 00:13:03.690\nRight-click on the sheet tab and\nthere is Move or Copy.\n\n269\n00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:06.840\nThe same way that we were dragging\nthe sheet tabs by reorganizing it,\n\n270\n00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.940\nwe are moving in a sense.\n\n271\n00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:10.830\nSo you could have done\nit by this dialog box.\n\n272\n00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:11.620\nLet's look at this.\n\n273\n00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:16.060\nMove or Copy before you do anything.\n\n274\n00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:20.079\nIf you are making a copy, check that box\noff at the bottom because you see there?\n\n275\n00:13:20.079 --> 00:13:23.578\nIf you don't check that box off,\nyou're not making a copy [LAUGH],\n\n276\n00:13:23.578 --> 00:13:24.650\nyou're moving it.\n\n277\n00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:27.500\nSo that's the big difference\nbetween move or copy.\n\n278\n00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:32.670\nSo if I wanted to keep it within this same\nworkbook, and create and copy, and let's\n\n279\n00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:36.400\nsay move it to the end, that sounds good,\nbut we know we could always reorganize it.\n\n280\n00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.434\nClick OK.\n\n281\n00:13:37.434 --> 00:13:39.870\nWell there you go,\nnow I have weekly sales two and\n\n282\n00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:43.020\nthat's where you got to be careful to,\nokay let's go ahead and\n\n283\n00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.890\nchange something really quickly\nlike [NOISE] there we go.\n\n284\n00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:49.575\nSo I know that there's the one sheet,\nthere's the other sheet,\n\n285\n00:13:49.575 --> 00:13:53.364\ndouble-click to rename it and\nwe could name it Weekly Sales-2.\n\n286\n00:13:53.364 --> 00:13:56.867\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then we can go ahead and\n\n287\n00:13:56.867 --> 00:14:00.023\nchange the tab color just for,\nbecause we want to, and\n\n288\n00:14:00.023 --> 00:14:04.774\nwe'll make it red cuz we have been talking\nabout Christmas cats throughout this.\n\n289\n00:14:04.774 --> 00:14:08.068\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So wonderful, much easier.\n\n290\n00:14:08.068 --> 00:14:12.375\nNow another thing that I always do is\nsay I have this as my worksheet or\n\n291\n00:14:12.375 --> 00:14:17.362\nmy workbook, and I need to send the weekly\nsales to my boss or to somebody else,\n\n292\n00:14:17.362 --> 00:14:21.040\nbut I don't want to have them\nsee all of my worksheets.\n\n293\n00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.580\nI just wanna send them an Excel\nfile with just this one.\n\n294\n00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:27.356\nSo let's go back into that right-click and\nMove or Copy,\n\n295\n00:14:27.356 --> 00:14:32.291\nbecause we were talking about moving and\ncopying within the same workbook,\n\n296\n00:14:32.291 --> 00:14:35.550\nbut obviously there's\nan option here of To Book.\n\n297\n00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:39.454\nYou could make it into a new workbook,\nand so if I choose, let’s go ahead and\n\n298\n00:14:39.454 --> 00:14:41.590\ntake that and move it into a new workbook.\n\n299\n00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:47.143\nNow notice if I do not check that box off\nit's like cutting it out of this file and\n\n300\n00:14:47.143 --> 00:14:49.010\nmoving it into the other.\n\n301\n00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:52.360\nIn this sense, I just wanna make\na copy to be able to send off.\n\n302\n00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:56.187\nSo if I check that off, and then click OK.\n\n303\n00:14:56.187 --> 00:14:59.907\nNotice that I have in my title bar,\nBook 1, and\n\n304\n00:14:59.907 --> 00:15:02.980\nI have one worksheet, not all of them.\n\n305\n00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:06.643\nSo this is where I would do a File &gt;\nSave As, name it weekly sales for Daniel,\n\n306\n00:15:06.643 --> 00:15:10.336\neven though I don't wanna [LAUGH] be\nworking for you because you sound scary.\n\n307\n00:15:10.336 --> 00:15:12.383\n&gt;&gt; I've changed to a more passive\naggressive type of behavior.\n\n308\n00:15:12.383 --> 00:15:14.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's even better.\n\n309\n00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:18.164\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So now I could go ahead and\n\n310\n00:15:18.164 --> 00:15:20.790\nsend it off to you, and\nso on, and so forth.\n\n311\n00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:25.780\nSo a brand new workbook, and so\nmoving worksheets from one workbook\n\n312\n00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:30.100\nto a new workbook, that's great, but\nmaybe I need to have this particular,\n\n313\n00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:33.920\nI'm gonna close this, and not save cuz\nthis is Book 1, not in my other file.\n\n314\n00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:39.610\nMaybe I needed this to be moved or\ncopied over into an existing file.\n\n315\n00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:41.910\nWell in that drop down of that move and\n\n316\n00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:46.000\ncopy, you notice that the only options\nwere the one that I'm working in, and new.\n\n317\n00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:50.520\nSo, what do you think I'm gonna need\nto do before, I just did a Justin.\n\n318\n00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.533\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Did you see that?\n\n319\n00:15:51.533 --> 00:15:54.862\n[LAUGH] If anybody watched Dev Pro TV,\nJustin does this a lot.\n\n320\n00:15:54.862 --> 00:15:55.767\nWhat do I need to do?\n\n321\n00:15:55.767 --> 00:15:58.267\nI need to open the file first.\n\n322\n00:15:58.267 --> 00:16:00.191\nSo if I did a File &gt; Open, and\n\n323\n00:16:00.191 --> 00:16:05.102\nlet's say I needed to move this into\nBrowse and we'll go to our desktop.\n\n324\n00:16:05.102 --> 00:16:06.796\nLet say the flash profile.\n\n325\n00:16:06.796 --> 00:16:09.580\nI'm just totally picking a random one.\n\n326\n00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:16.034\nSo going back over to my other workbook,\nright click on weekly sales, move or copy.\n\n327\n00:16:16.034 --> 00:16:20.971\nI want to drop this now you can\nsee that flash fill has become\n\n328\n00:16:20.971 --> 00:16:23.715\nan option here for me to move or copy.\n\n329\n00:16:23.715 --> 00:16:25.890\nClick OK,\nI'm gonna check the coffee box off.\n\n330\n00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:26.520\nAnd there you go.\n\n331\n00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.980\nWeekly sales is now in\nthis particular file.\n\n332\n00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:30.350\nI can move it around.\n\n333\n00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:31.460\nAnd so on and so forth.\n\n334\n00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.270\nSo, good stuff, lots.\n\n335\n00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:37.464\nEasy to kind of move stuff around\nas long as everything's opening,\n\n336\n00:16:37.464 --> 00:16:39.892\nyou know where that dialogue box is.\n\n337\n00:16:39.892 --> 00:16:41.615\nThere's my other favorite.\n\n338\n00:16:41.615 --> 00:16:42.558\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n339\n00:16:42.558 --> 00:16:44.623\nI [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH]\njust [INAUDIBLE] anyone.\n\n340\n00:16:44.623 --> 00:16:45.395\n&gt;&gt; She surprises herself.\n\n341\n00:16:45.395 --> 00:16:47.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You wrote that [INAUDIBLE].\n\n342\n00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:50.040\nI forgot. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; And\nthen I kinda surprised you like what.\n\n343\n00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:55.634\n[LAUGH] So if I wanted to make\na copy instead when I right click,\n\n344\n00:16:55.634 --> 00:16:57.620\nyou can Ctrl + drag.\n\n345\n00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:01.600\nRemember making a move and\ncopy we said, get to the active cell,\n\n346\n00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.680\nget to the full print out hold Ctrl and\nthen drag down.\n\n347\n00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.382\nDon't worry that that change,\nthat's something different.\n\n348\n00:17:06.382 --> 00:17:08.170\nOkay [LAUGH].\nThat was a bad example,\n\n349\n00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:10.270\nthat's using relative\nreference in a formula.\n\n350\n00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:11.960\nIt's okay, anyways.\n\n351\n00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.167\n&gt;&gt; What you said [LAUGH].\n\n352\n00:17:13.167 --> 00:17:14.840\n&gt;&gt; Yes, Ctrl + drag your worksheet.\n\n353\n00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:18.170\nSo hold the Ctrl key, click hold and\ndrag and notice that,\n\n354\n00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:21.070\nit's kind of small so I'll do it again.\n\n355\n00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:22.480\nLet me zoom in.\n\n356\n00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.800\nI'll take this Addresses, watch the icon.\n\n357\n00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.420\nYou see how it looks like there's a plus\n\n358\n00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:28.290\nsign in there-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n359\n00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:30.930\n&gt;&gt; If I let go of this control\nkey there is no plus sign.\n\n360\n00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:37.053\nSo hold that control is a drag and\ncopy of that particular worksheet tab.\n\n361\n00:17:37.053 --> 00:17:38.490\nThat's the easiest way, I think,\n\n362\n00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:43.110\nthe fastest way to make\na copy of your worksheet.\n\n363\n00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:48.760\nOkay, super fun, and pretty easy,\nit really is that simple.\n\n364\n00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:52.450\nNow we're gonna move on to some\ndifferent ways that you can manage,\n\n365\n00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:55.570\nit's really more of your\nviews that you're looking at.\n\n366\n00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:58.311\nAnd for example, in this, wow,\nI've copied this so many times.\n\n367\n00:17:58.311 --> 00:17:59.571\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's gone a little crazy.\n\n368\n00:17:59.571 --> 00:18:01.540\n&gt;&gt; It's getting a little crazy,\nthat's true.\n\n369\n00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:05.050\nThis particular worksheet\nis a list of addresses.\n\n370\n00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:07.630\nNow when I scroll down,\nwhen I get to here.\n\n371\n00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:12.450\nNow I only kept this at 23 rows but\nif you had 23,000.\n\n372\n00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:13.790\nOkay I've lost this.\n\n373\n00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:16.500\nIs this the last thing or\nis this the first thing?\n\n374\n00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:20.220\nIs this-\n&gt;&gt; I hate that, hate that.\n\n375\n00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:27.320\nYou know usually, which one of these is\nthe sale price versus the normal price?\n\n376\n00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.510\nAt least you get the idea.\n\n377\n00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:30.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You can't tell.\n\n378\n00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:33.690\n&gt;&gt; And you move over to here,\nand you're like, well now,\n\n379\n00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:35.736\nI'm on but who is this for?\n\n380\n00:18:35.736 --> 00:18:38.569\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Well let me tell you about freeze\n\n381\n00:18:38.569 --> 00:18:39.440\npains.\n\n382\n00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.550\nIt will take out the pain.\n\n383\n00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:43.969\n&gt;&gt; I see what you did there.\n\n384\n00:18:43.969 --> 00:18:46.284\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You, you.\n\n385\n00:18:46.284 --> 00:18:47.281\n&gt;&gt; It's like IcyHot right?\n\n386\n00:18:47.281 --> 00:18:52.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we have here, all right, love this.\n\n387\n00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:56.557\nThis is where I want to,\nwhen I move over to the right,\n\n388\n00:18:56.557 --> 00:19:00.032\nI want to keep seeing the first and\nlast name.\n\n389\n00:19:00.032 --> 00:19:04.510\nWhen I move down,\nI want to be able to keep this top row.\n\n390\n00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:06.310\nSo there's a reason why\nI'm clicking on cell C2.\n\n391\n00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:12.722\nBecause everything to the top and\nto the left will be frozen.\n\n392\n00:19:12.722 --> 00:19:14.604\nGoodness don't [INAUDIBLE] saying it.\n\n393\n00:19:14.604 --> 00:19:17.292\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You could see it welling up inside\n\n394\n00:19:17.292 --> 00:19:17.874\nof you.\n\n395\n00:19:17.874 --> 00:19:24.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So we've got our view tab here,\nand from our view, we go to freeze panes.\n\n396\n00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:27.770\nAnd if I just say, it says keep rows and\ncolumns visible where\n\n397\n00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:30.380\nthe rest of the worksheet scrolls\nbased on the current selection.\n\n398\n00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:31.480\nI click this.\n\n399\n00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:35.381\nNotice that there's these kind of\nlines going on here and watch.\n\n400\n00:19:35.381 --> 00:19:39.810\nIf I scroll on down [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; That's awesome.\n\n401\n00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:43.112\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That stage, and\nif I click over to the right.\n\n402\n00:19:43.112 --> 00:19:48.883\nGood, so now I can say, all right, well\nAlice Wonderpaws is with Team green and\n\n403\n00:19:48.883 --> 00:19:52.000\nBishop Timothy is blue and\nso and so forth.\n\n404\n00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.016\nSo much easier.\n\n405\n00:19:53.016 --> 00:19:56.156\nAll I got to do is scroll up and\ndown so that's what it means.\n\n406\n00:19:56.156 --> 00:19:57.563\n&gt;&gt; Why is this not the default view?\n\n407\n00:19:57.563 --> 00:19:59.964\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Why is that not something that's\n\n408\n00:19:59.964 --> 00:20:00.587\nalways on?\n\n409\n00:20:00.587 --> 00:20:02.010\n&gt;&gt; Well you know it's so smart but\n\n410\n00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:05.116\nif you're not having the information\norganized like this way.\n\n411\n00:20:05.116 --> 00:20:06.390\n&gt;&gt; My goodness.\n\n412\n00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:07.140\n&gt;&gt; It's really easy.\n\n413\n00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.370\n&gt;&gt; That's a lifesaver right there.\n\n414\n00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:12.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I love freeze pains.\n\n415\n00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:14.340\nAnd the nice thing is it\ndoesn't matter where you're at.\n\n416\n00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:19.980\nIf you come up here and unfreeze pains, it\njust takes it off and everything's back.\n\n417\n00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:20.610\n&gt;&gt; That's dumb.\n\n418\n00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:23.300\nPut it back on.\n&gt;&gt; Well the nice thing is some of those\n\n419\n00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:24.640\nother options.\n\n420\n00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.700\nFreeze top row,\nthat's just a default option.\n\n421\n00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:29.050\nSo go ahead and make the first row.\n\n422\n00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:30.390\nI didn't even hae to select anything.\n\n423\n00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:30.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n424\n00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:31.500\n&gt;&gt; It just does it.\n\n425\n00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.560\nAnd the same thing with\nthe freeze the first column.\n\n426\n00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:38.120\nAnd notice that now it goes ahead and\ndoes this.\n\n427\n00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:44.520\nBut if you needed it to break up in those\nparticular places like we wanted it too,\n\n428\n00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.430\nfirst and second column and\n\n429\n00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:51.170\nthe first row, then you just select\nthe cell for whatever's to the top and\n\n430\n00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:55.270\nthe left, and that becomes your freeze,\nsuper, super easy.\n\n431\n00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:56.860\nNow you know where it's at.\n\n432\n00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:59.110\n&gt;&gt; That's worth the ticket price alone,\nI gotta be honest with you,\n\n433\n00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:00.066\nthat's an amazing thing.\n\n434\n00:21:00.066 --> 00:21:03.000\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, [LAUGH] I love that.\n\n435\n00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.480\n[LAUGH] So a few other things that\nyou can do with your views and\n\n436\n00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.420\nhow you can kind of organize\nwhat you're looking at.\n\n437\n00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:11.373\n&gt;&gt; Now I can really\nmicro manage my people.\n\n438\n00:21:11.373 --> 00:21:13.297\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's a real popular thing too.\n\n439\n00:21:13.297 --> 00:21:14.077\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know.\n\n440\n00:21:14.077 --> 00:21:16.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We don't really have there here.\n\n441\n00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:17.017\n&gt;&gt; No thank God.\n\n442\n00:21:17.017 --> 00:21:18.863\n&gt;&gt; We're just left to our own devices.\n\n443\n00:21:18.863 --> 00:21:20.009\n&gt;&gt; I wouldn't be here if we did.\n\n444\n00:21:20.009 --> 00:21:23.747\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is kinda nice, just roam free.\n\n445\n00:21:23.747 --> 00:21:24.481\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n446\n00:21:24.481 --> 00:21:25.772\n&gt;&gt; So it's cool.\n\n447\n00:21:25.772 --> 00:21:30.570\nSo with this, there is a split,\nI know its functionality.\n\n448\n00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:32.150\nI think it's handy.\n\n449\n00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:34.880\nI will say that it kind of throws me off.\n\n450\n00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.890\nWhere, I don't even know where I'm at.\n\n451\n00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:37.710\nLet me show you.\n\n452\n00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:41.136\nI'm just gonna randomly select D nine for\nright now.\n\n453\n00:21:41.136 --> 00:21:42.130\nBecause when you're starting to move,\n\n454\n00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:43.620\nespecially if you have\na really large spreadsheet,\n\n455\n00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:44.940\nif you're moving down and around.\n\n456\n00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.030\nAnd yeah, you can use your freeze.\n\n457\n00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:49.390\nBut if I wanted to kind of compare\nthis area of the worksheet to this\n\n458\n00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:52.950\narea of the worksheet,\nI can't really get that with my freezing.\n\n459\n00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:55.310\nBut if you split it, so\nlet's just click here.\n\n460\n00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:59.380\nI'm selecting my cell and I go to split,\nwatch what's gonna happen.\n\n461\n00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:03.150\nNow there is this kind of\nsplit that has happened.\n\n462\n00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:06.720\nAnd down here, see there's a scroll here,\nup here there's a scroll.\n\n463\n00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.380\nAnd actually, behind my head you can\nreally see it a little bit more.\n\n464\n00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:10.400\n&gt;&gt; There's another scroll.\n\n465\n00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:16.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nI can scroll this separately from this.\n\n466\n00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:16.920\n&gt;&gt; Crazy.\n\n467\n00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:22.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now I do start to get a little\nconfused as to where am I right now.\n\n468\n00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.560\nBut if you know the information then\nyou can kind of see where I can\n\n469\n00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:30.040\nget this chunk here, get that chunk here,\nand then if you wanna move the split.\n\n470\n00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:34.760\nSee if you get the four pointed\narrows over the middle intersection,\n\n471\n00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:39.510\nthen I can go ahead and\nkind of reorganize it or re-split it and\n\n472\n00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.820\nnow I have my different\nscrolls in different places.\n\n473\n00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:46.100\nMaybe if I was looking at\nCheetos Sticks and Fritos Socks and\n\n474\n00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:51.120\nI want to kind of make that those are over\nhere and just keep on moving over.\n\n475\n00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:57.240\nI can change where this is being split.\n\n476\n00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:04.090\nYou can have independent scrolls for\neach part of that split, so that can be,\n\n477\n00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:09.878\nagain, I don't work with enough data where\nthis has been working for me personally.\n\n478\n00:23:09.878 --> 00:23:13.733\nAnd it just really kind of confuses me but\nthen one of those times\n\n479\n00:23:13.733 --> 00:23:17.828\nwhen I'm thinking back,\nwell actually I could use of that split.\n\n480\n00:23:17.828 --> 00:23:19.291\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it's okay,\n\n481\n00:23:19.291 --> 00:23:23.828\nif I want to split it up just clicking\nthe button again will take the split off.\n\n482\n00:23:23.828 --> 00:23:28.560\nSo split, there isn't like a drop end and\nsay like drop splitting.\n\n483\n00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:29.450\nIt's just an on and off.\n\n484\n00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:31.220\nIt's kinda like bold and\nthen turned it off.\n\n485\n00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:32.350\n&gt;&gt; Got you.\n\n486\n00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:37.371\n&gt;&gt; What else do we have,\nnew window this is again another\n\n487\n00:23:37.371 --> 00:23:41.783\nway to compare your same work book,\nthe same file.\n\n488\n00:23:41.783 --> 00:23:48.823\nBut I need to be able to see the addresses\nand the weekly sales next to each other,\n\n489\n00:23:48.823 --> 00:23:52.727\nbut in one workbook I\ncan't really do that.\n\n490\n00:23:52.727 --> 00:23:56.686\nSo what you do is up here in the view,\nthere is an option for new window,\n\n491\n00:23:56.686 --> 00:24:00.873\nand it open a second window for your\ndocument, so you can work in the same.\n\n492\n00:24:00.873 --> 00:24:04.633\nFile, but\nin different places at the same time.\n\n493\n00:24:04.633 --> 00:24:07.797\nSo this is where you're comparing\nworksheets within the same file.\n\n494\n00:24:07.797 --> 00:24:09.485\nNow watch the title bar on this one.\n\n495\n00:24:09.485 --> 00:24:14.556\nIf I go to new window,\nit's still manage worksheets too.\n\n496\n00:24:14.556 --> 00:24:17.074\nIt's like a separate instance of this.\n\n497\n00:24:17.074 --> 00:24:22.966\nSo if I wanted to put addresses here,\nand then weekly sales in the other one.\n\n498\n00:24:22.966 --> 00:24:25.687\nNow how do I get back to\nwhere I can see them?\n\n499\n00:24:25.687 --> 00:24:30.337\nNotice right over here,\nthere is View Side By Side.\n\n500\n00:24:30.337 --> 00:24:33.674\nInstead of switching back and\nforth, view them side by side, and\n\n501\n00:24:33.674 --> 00:24:35.590\nmakes comparing them easier.\n\n502\n00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:36.503\nThere we go.\n\n503\n00:24:36.503 --> 00:24:39.580\nRemember that we did that in the Windows\nbasic where we dragged them across?\n\n504\n00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:40.826\nIt's kinda the same-\n&gt;&gt; Same thing.\n\n505\n00:24:40.826 --> 00:24:41.506\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n506\n00:24:41.506 --> 00:24:46.483\nBut the nice thing about it if you do it\nwithin Excel, notice that your scrolls,\n\n507\n00:24:46.483 --> 00:24:48.279\nit scrolls synchronously.\n\n508\n00:24:48.279 --> 00:24:50.845\nYeah, that's a nice bonus there.\n\n509\n00:24:50.845 --> 00:24:54.817\n&gt;&gt; So this is really meant to\ndo this specific function?\n\n510\n00:24:54.817 --> 00:24:55.838\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nSo I can have,\n\n511\n00:24:55.838 --> 00:24:59.813\nokay I wanna look at sheet two and\nsheet five next to each other so\n\n512\n00:24:59.813 --> 00:25:03.360\nI can really start comparing them and\nI can scroll them.\n\n513\n00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:07.933\nI'm scrolling them synchronously, but\nthere is that button up here since now I\n\n514\n00:25:07.933 --> 00:25:12.643\nhave my real estate that's a little bit\nsmaller that you can even see that, okay,\n\n515\n00:25:12.643 --> 00:25:14.981\nit looks like it's scrolling the same.\n\n516\n00:25:14.981 --> 00:25:20.574\nSo if I didn't want to, I can turn that\noff and now this can scroll independently\n\n517\n00:25:20.574 --> 00:25:25.689\nfrom this one, so if you didn't want\nthe sync scrolling you can do that.\n\n518\n00:25:25.689 --> 00:25:29.565\nAnd then you can kind of move it around\nand be able to do things, and so\n\n519\n00:25:29.565 --> 00:25:32.024\non and so forth, which can be really cool.\n\n520\n00:25:32.024 --> 00:25:34.685\nSo now this one is,\nokay let me just go ahead.\n\n521\n00:25:34.685 --> 00:25:36.273\nAnd now I don't know which file this one.\n\n522\n00:25:36.273 --> 00:25:38.941\nOkay that's the second instance,\nso I'm gonna close that.\n\n523\n00:25:38.941 --> 00:25:44.202\nSo I'll have my same other file and\nthat's where I'm good to go.\n\n524\n00:25:44.202 --> 00:25:47.266\nAnd some of these other\nones were maybe you have,\n\n525\n00:25:47.266 --> 00:25:51.827\nI'm gonna do a new window twice just\nto get multiple workbooks opened and\n\n526\n00:25:51.827 --> 00:25:54.996\nthis would be three\niterations of that same file.\n\n527\n00:25:54.996 --> 00:25:59.284\nIf I come over to View, there are ways\nthat you can arrange your windows.\n\n528\n00:25:59.284 --> 00:26:04.274\nInstead of you like pulling down from\nthe title bar to undock it and then\n\n529\n00:26:04.274 --> 00:26:09.433\nmove it around, I can have it to where\nI can take all of my active workbooks\n\n530\n00:26:09.433 --> 00:26:14.698\nthat are open and I can tile them or\nlet's go with horizontal and click OK.\n\n531\n00:26:14.698 --> 00:26:17.834\nSee now this is where I don't have\na very big monitor right now and\n\n532\n00:26:17.834 --> 00:26:20.928\nmy resolution is low, so\nyou guys can't see this pretty well.\n\n533\n00:26:20.928 --> 00:26:23.767\nBut if you had a big monitor,\nthis could be really handy.\n\n534\n00:26:23.767 --> 00:26:28.645\nSo I could move around in this file and\nthen move around in this file differently,\n\n535\n00:26:28.645 --> 00:26:30.018\nand so on and so forth.\n\n536\n00:26:30.018 --> 00:26:32.411\nAnd just kinda put them\nall next to each other.\n\n537\n00:26:32.411 --> 00:26:37.301\nNow notice that my ribbon has\nkind of come down into here.\n\n538\n00:26:37.301 --> 00:26:40.920\nSo if you go ahead and\nminimize this window and\n\n539\n00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:44.737\nthen get to where you can\nmaximize another one.\n\n540\n00:26:44.737 --> 00:26:47.440\nYou kind of have to play around\nwith your windows a little bit and\n\n541\n00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.602\nif you're not very comfortable with\nwindow management if you wanna say,\n\n542\n00:26:50.602 --> 00:26:52.342\nthis might start to get a little freaky.\n\n543\n00:26:52.342 --> 00:26:56.964\nBut as long as you can kind of get to\nthe place where, well, let's go back and\n\n544\n00:26:56.964 --> 00:27:01.729\nhave them all tiled, and then click OK,\nthen this is where if I come back down,\n\n545\n00:27:01.729 --> 00:27:03.415\nthey're all still there.\n\n546\n00:27:03.415 --> 00:27:04.718\nI gotta maximize that one.\n\n547\n00:27:04.718 --> 00:27:08.020\nSo anyways, you still have your\nwindow controls from here.\n\n548\n00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:12.365\nAnd you can do that from the View\ntab of Excel rather, like I said,\n\n549\n00:27:12.365 --> 00:27:17.361\nthan doing it like as windows itself and\nit will let you go through it there.\n\n550\n00:27:17.361 --> 00:27:21.090\nBut do remember minimize,\nmaximize arranging and\n\n551\n00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:25.772\nwe can go through all of those\ndifferent ways that you can tile and\n\n552\n00:27:25.772 --> 00:27:29.600\narrange your windows to\ncompare your information.\n\n553\n00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.928\nAnd that comes the end of my notes, so\n\n554\n00:27:31.928 --> 00:27:35.549\nthat's how we can manage our\nworksheets and workbooks.\n\n555\n00:27:35.549 --> 00:27:39.303\nAnd like you said, we're at the end\nof this series, so hopefully you\n\n556\n00:27:39.303 --> 00:27:43.214\nwill stick around for the Excel\nadvanced series that's gonna come up.\n\n557\n00:27:43.214 --> 00:27:45.517\nStill not doing our functions or formulas.\n\n558\n00:27:45.517 --> 00:27:48.339\nGot that in a whole separate show.\n\n559\n00:27:48.339 --> 00:27:49.996\nSo I hope you've enjoyed.\n\n560\n00:27:49.996 --> 00:27:51.624\nAnd it's been wonderful talking to you.\n\n561\n00:27:51.624 --> 00:27:53.185\nAnd so now I'll go ahead and stop.\n\n562\n00:27:53.185 --> 00:27:54.333\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne.\n\n563\n00:27:54.333 --> 00:27:55.027\nIt's been a lot of fun.\n\n564\n00:27:55.027 --> 00:27:56.929\nI know that I've had\na great time doing this.\n\n565\n00:27:56.929 --> 00:27:58.271\nI learned a lot about Excel.\n\n566\n00:27:58.271 --> 00:28:00.396\nHopefully the audience has as well.\n\n567\n00:28:00.396 --> 00:28:02.167\nWe do appreciate your time and effort and\n\n568\n00:28:02.167 --> 00:28:04.207\nputting into these shows\nthat we might learn.\n\n569\n00:28:04.207 --> 00:28:06.540\nBut like you said,\nlooks like we're out of time.\n\n570\n00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:08.159\nWe do thank you for watching though.\n\n571\n00:28:08.159 --> 00:28:10.796\nSigning off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n572\n00:28:10.796 --> 00:28:11.559\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n573\n00:28:11.559 --> 00:28:12.533\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n574\n00:28:16.198 --> 00:28:17.606\n[SOUND]\n\n",
