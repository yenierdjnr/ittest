00:00:14.046\nI'm your show host Vonn Smith and\nin this course overview,\n\n4\n00:00:14.046 --> 00:00:18.030\nwe're going to be talking about what\nexactly is covered in this series.\n\n5\n00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.290\nWho is our target audience?\n\n6\n00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.930\nDo we need to know anything\nbefore we get started and\n\n7\n00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.890\nany extra tidbits I have for you.\n\n8\n00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.210\nAs you can see,\n\n9\n00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.590\nthere's only two main topics that\nwe have in this particular series.\n\n10\n00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.605\nWe have the introduction and\nformat work books.\n\n11\n00:00:30.605 --> 00:00:33.740\nBut there is quite few things that\nwe talk about in each one of those.\n\n12\n00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.040\nIn the introduction we start from\nthe very beginning of like, what's Excel?\n\n13\n00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.250\nWhat's the history of Excel?\n\n14\n00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.272\nWhat's the file format?\n\n15\n00:00:39.272 --> 00:00:44.410\nThen we get into some other basics\nwithin the Mac operating system.\n\n16\n00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.400\nWe're still using Windows, and what is the\napplication window versus the worksheet\n\n17\n00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.400\nwindow and how to navigate around that.\n\n18\n00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.040\nAnd the interface of Excel, what is the\nribbon, where is the quick access toolbar,\n\n19\n00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.160\nwhere is the status bar,\nhow do I get to the zooms and everything.\n\n20\n00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.200\nSo that's all within those\nparticular episodes.\n\n21\n00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.610\nThen we're gonna get into\nnavigating a workbook.\n\n22\n00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.630\nHow do I get around?\n\n23\n00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.890\nWhat's the name box?\n\n24\n00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.280\nHow can I use that to\nget to particular cells?\n\n25\n00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.300\nUsing the keyboard to help us get around\nto be a little more efficient and\n\n26\n00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.060\nproductive with getting around\na particular workbook and worksheets.\n\n27\n00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.290\nAnd the all important,\nhow do I select things?\n\n28\n00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.840\nWe're gonna spend quite a bit of time\n\n29\n00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.480\nwithin that particular episode about\ndifferent ways that we can do that, again,\n\n30\n00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.265\nwith keyboard shortcuts,\nhow to use your mouse to select to effect.\n\n31\n00:01:34.265 --> 00:01:39.275\nCuz you've gotta make sure you know where\nto select before you can do anything.\n\n32\n00:01:39.275 --> 00:01:42.460\nThen we're gonna get into actually\ninserting data into our cells.\n\n33\n00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.790\nHow do I type values in?\n\n34\n00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.410\nHow do I edit them?\n\n35\n00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.930\nWe'll also be covering fill series,\nwhich is really fun, and\n\n36\n00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.210\ndifferent ways that we can go ahead and\n\n37\n00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.290\nquickly get in things like the days of\nthe week and the months of the year.\n\n38\n00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.290\nWe also have an episode on cut,\ncopy, paste.\n\n39\n00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.720\nYes, an entire episode on it.\n\n40\n00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.040\nYou're thinking, hm, really?\n\n41\n00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.960\nWell, in Excel,\nit can get a little tricky.\n\n42\n00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.150\nAnd there's some little gotchas in there\nthat you need to be aware of so that way\n\n43\n00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:14.550\nyou can understand what it's doing when\nyou copy something and paste something.\n\n44\n00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.100\nEspecially when you get into your rows and\ncolumns.\n\n45\n00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.150\nAnd then we'll talk about file formats and\nhow to export, which\n\n46\n00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.820\nis really to just save as, and really\ntalk about the CSV file format at length.\n\n47\n00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.700\nThen we get into how do I format\nthings within a workbook?\n\n48\n00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.920\nStarting with modifying\nthe structure of your worksheets.\n\n49\n00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.830\nHow do I add or delete columns or rows?\n\n50\n00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.180\nHow do I change the widths of columns and\nrows?\n\n51\n00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.380\nWe'll also get in to how to merge cells.\n\n52\n00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.270\nThen we'll move on to formatting.\n\n53\n00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.440\nWe'll be formatting our cells with font,\ncolor, size.\n\n54\n00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.400\nWe'll also do a little bit more with\nhorizontal and vertical alignment.\n\n55\n00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.130\nWe'll also talk about styles.\n\n56\n00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.760\nI love styles and how they can\nbe really handy and helpful for\n\n57\n00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.205\nformatting your data within\nyour worksheets and workbooks.\n\n58\n00:03:03.205 --> 00:03:06.280\nThen we get into the all\nimportant number formats, okay?\n\n59\n00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.290\nA big deal within Excel.\n\n60\n00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.130\nA very important concept and\ntopic to understand,\n\n61\n00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.590\nso we have some good information there.\n\n62\n00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.125\nThen we go into page layout for printing.\n\n63\n00:03:16.125 --> 00:03:19.525\nNow, yes, this is a spreadsheet\napplication, but you are normally or\n\n64\n00:03:19.525 --> 00:03:23.284\nmost likely going to be printing, so\nwe need to know those different options.\n\n65\n00:03:23.284 --> 00:03:27.338\nWe'll get into page breaks and\nhow do I do shrinking and\n\n66\n00:03:27.338 --> 00:03:31.584\nhow do I fit things on pages\nthat you want to have printed.\n\n67\n00:03:31.584 --> 00:03:35.962\nAnd we'll also talk about\nmanaging our workbooks, meaning,\n\n68\n00:03:35.962 --> 00:03:38.115\nhow do I rename my worksheets?\n\n69\n00:03:38.115 --> 00:03:42.150\nHow do I change the tab colors and\norganizing them?\n\n70\n00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.780\nSo who is this for?\n\n71\n00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.000\nThis is for all Office users,\nwith a capital O,\n\n72\n00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.040\nmeaning you're using Office 365 or\na locally installed version of Excel.\n\n73\n00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.070\nAnd this would be starting at the basics,\n\n74\n00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.900\nI mean, we'll start from\nthe very beginning and move up.\n\n75\n00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.325\nSo I would say this would be for\nanybody that has some basic skills and\n\n76\n00:04:01.325 --> 00:04:05.470\nwant to move up into the intermediate\nlevel of knowing Excel.\n\n77\n00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.220\nI would say that would\nbe the target audience.\n\n78\n00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.400\nDo you need to know anything?\n\n79\n00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.680\nYou need to know a little a bit about\nhow the Mac operating system works.\n\n80\n00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.690\nSo it's a general understanding of like\nwhere is the Finder and to open and\n\n81\n00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.750\nclose files.\n\n82\n00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.430\nWe do cover that on our episodes as well.\n\n83\n00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.158\nYou don't need anything\nof Excel to get started.\n\n84\n00:04:23.158 --> 00:04:24.910\nMaybe you've used it a little bit and\n\n85\n00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.470\nwant like a refresher course or\njust different ways of doing things.\n\n86\n00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.510\nThis is a great series to start with that.\n\n87\n00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.780\nAnd maybe familiarity with other\nOffice products could be helpful.\n\n88\n00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.680\nNot imperative.\n\n89\n00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.830\nJust you wanna start somewhere\nfrom the beginning in Excel,\n\n90\n00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.470\nthis is the series for you.\n\n91\n00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.910\nThere's always other options of how to do\nthings in all of your Office programs,\n\n92\n00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.750\nExcel included.\n\n93\n00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.508\nEverybody has a different reason why they\nwant to use Excel and how they use Excel.\n\n94\n00:04:54.508 --> 00:04:59.150\nSo, I am trying to show you from just\na practical standpoint of how to use\n\n95\n00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.415\nthis particular product.\n\n96\n00:05:01.415 --> 00:05:04.567\nSo, just do be aware that everybody\nhas different reasons for\n\n97\n00:05:04.567 --> 00:05:07.610\nusing them and that kinda ties\ninto the different options.\n\n98\n00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.510\nUpdates do happen, yes.\n\n99\n00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.740\nBecause this is an Office 366 product,\nthere is going to be updates.\n\n100\n00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.950\nSo, at the time of this recording,\nI have a particular version.\n\n101\n00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.120\nWhen you're watching it, there might\nhave been some more updates, and so\n\n102\n00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.190\nthings might be a little bit different.\n\n103\n00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.220\nSo definitely check\nabout your versions and\n\n104\n00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.270\nwhere to find what version\nof Excel you are working in.\n\n105\n00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.260\nWe talk about that in the introduction\nepisode within this course.\n\n106\n00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.680\nSo just be aware of it.\n\n107\n00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.120\nAnd, of course, there's tons of\ninformation about Excel online through\n\n108\n00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.770\nthe different Microsoft help files and\nother websites.\n\n109\n00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.150\nSo definitely use the Internet to\nyour advantage to search for answers.\n\n110\n00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.170\nAnd of course, have some fun.\n\n111\n00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.630\nExcel can be frustrating\nfrom time to time.\n\n112\n00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.490\nI can understand, I have been there.\n\n113\n00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.857\nBut hopefully going\nthrough these episodes,\n\n114\n00:05:55.857 --> 00:05:58.350\nyou'll have a better understanding of it.\n\n115\n00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.700\nAnd I like to have fun,\nI hope you have fun and\n\n116\n00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.061\nI hope you learn a lot and\nI will see you soon.\n\n117\n00:06:05.061 --> 00:06:10.058\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

use a product we\nhave to know, why would I use it?\n\n15\n00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.810\nWhat is it for?\n\n16\n00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.360\nWho cares, right?\n\n17\n00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.260\nWhy do I care and ultimately,\nthat's my lead off question Vonne,\n\n18\n00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.563\nwhy should I care about Excel?\n&gt;&gt; Because that way you can make fun Excel\n\n19\n00:00:54.563 --> 00:00:57.335\npuns, yeah, you excelled at\nthat very well, so [LAUGH].\n\n20\n00:00:57.335 --> 00:01:01.680\nBut no, exactly, you start at the very\nbeginning, this is our introduction.\n\n21\n00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.360\nSo I have a PowerPoint\npresentation to help us along.\n\n22\n00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.710\nI didn't actually run it in the show,\nI don't know why.\n\n23\n00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.450\nI know why, because I have some notes that\nI'm gonna show you guys along the way.\n\n24\n00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.410\nSo why don't we use that to kinda\nhelp us go through the intro.\n\n25\n00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.270\nSo let's jump down into here and\nyeah, exactly like what you said.\n\n26\n00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.670\nWhat is Excel?\n\n27\n00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.210\nAnd this is the 2016 version.\n\n28\n00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.020\nThis is for Mac.\n\n29\n00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.630\nWell, Excel is part of\nthe Office Applications Suite and\n\n30\n00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.300\nit is known as\nthe spreadsheet application.\n\n31\n00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.590\nThe word application, right, I mean\nI feel like it's thrown around a lot,\n\n32\n00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.740\npeople are like it's the Excel app.\n\n33\n00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.860\nMe, nowadays, the connotation of app,\nI'm thinking on my phone, right?\n\n34\n00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.920\nThat's the things that I click on and\neverything like that.\n\n35\n00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.405\nAnd there is an Excel app for\nyour mobile devices.\n\n36\n00:01:55.405 --> 00:01:59.785\nThat's totally true too, but the word\napplication in computer world, I mean,\n\n37\n00:01:59.785 --> 00:02:02.215\nit's also you could say software.\n\n38\n00:02:02.215 --> 00:02:06.035\nExcel is a program,\nExcel is an application,\n\n39\n00:02:06.035 --> 00:02:10.975\nExcel is a piece of software that\ndoes something specifically.\n\n40\n00:02:10.975 --> 00:02:14.085\nAnd that is create spreadsheets, okay?\n\n41\n00:02:14.085 --> 00:02:19.530\nYou are going to be creating\nworkbooks in Excel.\n\n42\n00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.050\nIf you were using Word,\nyou would be creating documents.\n\n43\n00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.630\nIf we're here in PowerPoint, what you're\nlooking at is a PowerPoint presentation.\n\n44\n00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.930\nYes, they're all files, but that's\nwhat we're going to be referring to,\n\n45\n00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.440\nthat particular type of applications,\nend results if you would say.\n\n46\n00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.630\nSo a workbook, just like you have a book.\n\n47\n00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.922\nYou know those printed things, Justin-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n48\n00:02:43.922 --> 00:02:45.680\n&gt;&gt; You're not Dustin, you're Justin.\n\n49\n00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.900\n&gt;&gt; Justin Jennison, my alter ego,\n\n50\n00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.720\nit comes out every now and again.\n\n51\n00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.780\nBut those printed what?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly,\n\n52\n00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.100\nI couldn't get your name right.\n\n53\n00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.800\nThose old school things,\n\n54\n00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.960\nthose books, right?\n&gt;&gt; So the ledgers and\n\n55\n00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.250\naccounting ledgers and the graph.\n\n56\n00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.490\nYou put the name here and\n\n57\n00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.510\nyou got the rows.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n58\n00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.130\n&gt;&gt; My teacher used\n\n59\n00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.877\nto use old school grade books like that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n60\n00:03:06.877 --> 00:03:07.655\n&gt;&gt; They were kinda like that.\n\n61\n00:03:07.655 --> 00:03:08.491\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n62\n00:03:08.491 --> 00:03:10.980\n&gt;&gt; I've seen those before.\n\n63\n00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.170\nThey're kinda so passé now.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n64\n00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.970\n&gt;&gt; Nowadays, right?\n\n65\n00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:14.487\n&gt;&gt; Right and\n\n66\n00:03:14.487 --> 00:03:18.626\nthat's where anything printed so\nit's like old school nowadays it seems.\n\n67\n00:03:18.626 --> 00:03:22.342\nBut yes any type of book,\nwhether it be a ledger or\n\n68\n00:03:22.342 --> 00:03:28.420\na regular book that you go ahead and\nread, it's created with pages or sheets.\n\n69\n00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.020\nSo a bunch of worksheets\nmake up a workbook.\n\n70\n00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.260\nSo that's what we're going to be working\nwith within a spreadsheet application.\n\n71\n00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.380\nSo hey, I had this Excel spreadsheet.\n\n72\n00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.440\nHey, I have this Excel workbook for you.\n\n73\n00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.903\nHey, I have this Excel file.\n\n74\n00:03:44.903 --> 00:03:46.332\nThey're kinda all the same thing.\n\n75\n00:03:46.332 --> 00:03:50.140\nSo they're all referring to the digital\nfile that is going to be created\n\n76\n00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.140\nwhen you use Excel.\n\n77\n00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.550\nWhy do we use Excel?\n\n78\n00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.310\nWe use Excel to arrange and analyze data.\n\n79\n00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.725\nLike you said that ledger,\nwe think of ledger we go ahead and\n\n80\n00:03:59.725 --> 00:04:02.995\nhave a little squares to check\nthings off and everything.\n\n81\n00:04:02.995 --> 00:04:04.731\nYeah, that's what we're gonna be doing.\n\n82\n00:04:04.731 --> 00:04:09.220\nIt's not a word processor, it's not\nsomething that makes slides out of,\n\n83\n00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.726\nwe're going to be creating worksheets.\n\n84\n00:04:11.726 --> 00:04:15.448\nAnd from that you can do\na lot of calculations and\n\n85\n00:04:15.448 --> 00:04:22.030\ncalculations really are referred to\nas function or formulas in Excel.\n\n86\n00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.520\nIn this particular series, we're not\ngoing to get into the calculations and\n\n87\n00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.650\nthe functions within Excel.\n\n88\n00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.100\nWe'll make mention to it, you might\neven see a few of them here or there.\n\n89\n00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.920\nBut we have a whole series\ndedicated to Excel functions, so\n\n90\n00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.410\nthat's in another series.\n\n91\n00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.350\nThis is really just kind of getting you\nstarted, the essentials of Excel and\n\n92\n00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.480\nthat's what this particular\ncourse is focused on.\n\n93\n00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.110\nSo yes Justin, your question?\n&gt;&gt; So this series is more about being\n\n94\n00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.460\nacclimated to the tools that\nare at our disposal, right?\n\n95\n00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.680\nYou don't show up at a wood shop and go,\nI'm about to make an oak armoire, right?\n\n96\n00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.940\nThey're like, no, no,\nyou gotta figure out what these things do\n\n97\n00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.480\nbecause I could see someone\ngoing this is a hammer.\n\n98\n00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.860\nI'm gonna cut this wood with this hammer.\n\n99\n00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.240\nYou need to be familiar with the tools and\nthe capabilities of respective tools.\n\n100\n00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.390\nAnd ultimately,\nthat's what the series is about, right?\n\n101\n00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.000\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, we're gonna start by making\n\n102\n00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.220\na little coffee, no, not even a coffee\ntable, what's the first thing we make in\n\n103\n00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.750\nwood shop?\n\n104\n00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.830\n&gt;&gt; A coaster.\n&gt;&gt; There go.\n\n105\n00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.988\n&gt;&gt; Maybe a birdhouse.\n\n106\n00:05:23.988 --> 00:05:24.530\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n107\n00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:25.950\n&gt;&gt; Birdhouse is a little complex for\n\n108\n00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:26.510\nmy taste.\n\n109\n00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.060\nI'm thinking coaster, where all\nyou've gotta do is cut out a circle.\n\n110\n00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.110\nThat sounds good.\n\n111\n00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.760\nYes, we are gonna start at the very\nbeginning and honestly this is one of\n\n112\n00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:38.400\nthose series like right here,\nwhat exactly is an Excel spreadsheet?\n\n113\n00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.070\nIt's something that's made up of rows and\ncolumns.\n\n114\n00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:46.095\nSo we're going to be putting in data,\ninto our cells.\n\n115\n00:05:46.095 --> 00:05:48.795\nSo that's,\nwe're starting at the beginning.\n\n116\n00:05:48.795 --> 00:05:52.575\nWe have row headers,\nwe have column headers.\n\n117\n00:05:52.575 --> 00:05:54.570\nWhere they intersect is a cell.\n\n118\n00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.380\nUnderstanding how to select cells,\ninsert data, copy and paste data,\n\n119\n00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.070\nall of those different things.\n\n120\n00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.520\nYou got to know how to\nwalk before you can run.\n\n121\n00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.410\nYou got to know what a hammer is before\nyou go cutting wood with a hammer.\n\n122\n00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:07.750\nSo, yeah, exactly.\n\n123\n00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.600\nSo we're going to go ahead and do all\nof that within this particular series.\n\n124\n00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.180\nNow Excel, like I said from the beginning,\nis part of the Office 365 suite of\n\n125\n00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:22.170\napplications, and I've got a couple\ndifferent applications up here.\n\n126\n00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:25.020\nSome of them depend on what type\n\n127\n00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.260\nof product plan you're\ngoing to be working with.\n\n128\n00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.180\nSo definitely check this out.\n\n129\n00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.430\nNot all of these applications\nare going to be available in\n\n130\n00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.420\nevery single subscription level.\n\n131\n00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.370\nAnd there's a lot of them in Office 365.\n\n132\n00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:45.800\nSo you do have to be aware of just\nthe different product plans and what's\n\n133\n00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.980\navailable to you in each one of them.\n&gt;&gt; But Excel is part of what I would call,\n\n134\n00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.340\nthe core set of applications.\n\n135\n00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.460\nWord, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint,\n\n136\n00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:59.320\nthose are probably always available to you\nif you have Office 365 available at all,\n\n137\n00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.090\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n138\n00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:01.850\n&gt;&gt; So those are the core products that we\n\n139\n00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:02.710\nwould be able to use.\n\n140\n00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.819\nSo congratulations you're about\nto learn some more about Excel.\n\n141\n00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:06.719\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, yes,\n\n142\n00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:10.739\nsome of these are way outliers like Visio\nand InfoPath, I haven't seen those or\n\n143\n00:07:10.739 --> 00:07:12.340\nI still see them.\n\n144\n00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.740\nAnd they still are available,\nthey are, but\n\n145\n00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.460\nthey are not part of\nwhen you buy the suite.\n\n146\n00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.882\nThose are all kind of extra stuff and\n\n147\n00:07:18.882 --> 00:07:23.820\nsome of them are more services like\nthe Skype for business and the teams.\n\n148\n00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.870\nThey're not necessarily locally\ninstalled software like\n\n149\n00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.090\nwe're going to have in\nthis particular show.\n\n150\n00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:34.825\nSo definitely know what product\nplan that your working with and\n\n151\n00:07:34.825 --> 00:07:38.839\nwhether you're the one that's\nbuying these product plans or not,\n\n152\n00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:41.669\ncheck with your organization\nas to what level.\n\n153\n00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:46.412\nBecause there is a difference,\nin the product plans, of whether or\n\n154\n00:07:46.412 --> 00:07:51.255\nnot you can even have locally\ninstalled versions of these products.\n\n155\n00:07:51.255 --> 00:07:54.831\nSome of the product plans,\nyou only get the online one.\n\n156\n00:07:54.831 --> 00:07:59.351\nSo that's why this slide is\ndedicated to yes, we have Excel and\n\n157\n00:07:59.351 --> 00:08:04.571\nOffice 265, the whole cloud computing and\nall this kinda fun stuff.\n\n158\n00:08:04.571 --> 00:08:09.648\nYeah, well, this particular\ncourse is going to be focused\n\n159\n00:08:09.648 --> 00:08:14.225\non the locally installed\nversion of Excel 2016.\n\n160\n00:08:14.225 --> 00:08:19.533\nThis is not a show on the Excel that\nyou can use online through a web\n\n161\n00:08:19.533 --> 00:08:26.238\nbrowser that is it can either be free as\npart of the plans that you can get, right?\n\n162\n00:08:26.238 --> 00:08:31.720\nOr it could be a purchased plan that you\nonly get access to the online version.\n\n163\n00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:35.660\nSo you go onto your Internet Explorer,\nor Chrome, or\n\n164\n00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:38.770\nwhatever browser you have and\nyou're using Excel there.\n\n165\n00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:42.090\nThat's referred to as Excel online.\n\n166\n00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.530\nWe're not gonna go there\nin this particular course.\n\n167\n00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:48.150\nIt's all going to be locally\ninstalled versions of Excel.\n\n168\n00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:52.395\nWhether you have the subscription\nbased plans like the Office 365,\n\n169\n00:08:52.395 --> 00:08:56.850\nor your company or\nyourself has purchased a single,\n\n170\n00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:01.345\nstandalone Excel product that you have\nlocally downloaded on your computer.\n\n171\n00:09:01.345 --> 00:09:05.575\nAnd you are not connected to the whole\nsubscription Office 365 Cloud world,\n\n172\n00:09:05.575 --> 00:09:08.085\nif you wanna say.\n&gt;&gt; And Vonne,\n\n173\n00:09:08.085 --> 00:09:11.470\nI know some people are like, well,\nwhy was she even talking about that?\n\n174\n00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:15.850\nProduct fragmentation is a very\ninteresting thing in the Microsoft realm.\n\n175\n00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:18.210\nYou have all these products that do\na bunch of different things, but\n\n176\n00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:22.640\neven internal to those you have products\nthat have different levels of capability\n\n177\n00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.940\nbased on the platform that they run on.\n\n178\n00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:26.030\nThere may be some overlap.\n\n179\n00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:28.918\nSo the things you see in this show, you\nmay be able to do that in Excel Online.\n\n180\n00:09:28.918 --> 00:09:32.390\nHowever, your mileage may vary,\nand it can change at any time, so\n\n181\n00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:34.480\nno warranty's implied.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n182\n00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.650\nthere are somethings online that I'm,\nwhat?\n\n183\n00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:38.610\nYou can't do that.\n\n184\n00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:42.070\nYeah, and then of course,\nwhy do we even have Excel for\n\n185\n00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:45.520\nMac versus just Excel period?\n\n186\n00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:50.280\nBecause Excel PC and Excel Mac,\nthey're different, so that's why I made\n\n187\n00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:55.530\na whole series on these particular\ndifferent platforms and different types.\n\n188\n00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:57.630\nSo little bit of history.\n\n189\n00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:01.770\nI love some history, I love me\nsome versions and file types, and\n\n190\n00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:03.230\nI love logos in here.\n\n191\n00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:08.524\nSo right now, we are on the Office 365,\nbut we're really on,\n\n192\n00:10:08.524 --> 00:10:15.001\nExcel 2016 and right now that's what\nMac and PC are both on those versions.\n\n193\n00:10:15.001 --> 00:10:17.822\nBut they were always off\nthroughout the years.\n\n194\n00:10:17.822 --> 00:10:24.672\nThey were always one year or so\noff all the way back to 2003.\n\n195\n00:10:24.672 --> 00:10:27.110\nDo you remember this logo there, Justin?\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n196\n00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:30.441\nI remember it jumping on an old Mac\nthat I had, so I would click it and\n\n197\n00:10:30.441 --> 00:10:31.344\nit kinda jumped.\n\n198\n00:10:31.344 --> 00:10:34.900\nAnd I just remember it looked\nlike a weird amorphous man.\n\n199\n00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:38.889\nOr something like that kinda going, yay!\n&gt;&gt; I'm\n\n200\n00:10:38.889 --> 00:10:42.505\nlike whoever picked that, that's Excel?\n\n201\n00:10:42.505 --> 00:10:44.165\nMm, okay.\n\n202\n00:10:44.165 --> 00:10:48.465\nYou always have different\nstylistic preferences at the time.\n\n203\n00:10:48.465 --> 00:10:52.109\nIt's kinda fun to watch the progression\nof different artwork and\n\n204\n00:10:52.109 --> 00:10:55.033\nlogos of different companies\nthroughout the year.\n\n205\n00:10:55.033 --> 00:10:58.411\nThese were the versions and yeah,\nthey always came out with PC versions.\n\n206\n00:10:58.411 --> 00:11:04.220\nLike it was Office 2003, but\nthen the Mac version was 2004.\n\n207\n00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:08.350\nAnd then there was 2007, but 2008 for MAC.\n\n208\n00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:12.170\nThey finally got on the same years now,\nand of course now, with this Office 365,\n\n209\n00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:15.410\nwe probably aren't gonna have\nthat much split anymore,\n\n210\n00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:18.340\nhopefully, between PC and Mac versions.\n\n211\n00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:21.950\nAnd these little guys up at the top, just\nto show you, I can zoom in a little bit,\n\n212\n00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.150\nthese were the PC versions of them.\n\n213\n00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:25.489\nJust some different logos.\n\n214\n00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:31.084\nBut I do remember the xs and I do remember\nthis from the different Mac versions\n\n215\n00:11:31.084 --> 00:11:33.249\ngoing through the different years.\n\n216\n00:11:33.249 --> 00:11:36.285\nBut the biggest thing to go ahead and\npoint out, oops,\n\n217\n00:11:36.285 --> 00:11:39.923\nwhoa sorry, guys, on this one,\nit's actually behind my head.\n\n218\n00:11:39.923 --> 00:11:45.314\nBut the difference between\nthe xlsx file format and the xls,\n\n219\n00:11:45.314 --> 00:11:51.881\nand that's where you have the different\nversions depending on the year.\n\n220\n00:11:51.881 --> 00:11:54.996\nNow, 2004, that was a while ago.\n\n221\n00:11:54.996 --> 00:11:58.870\nAre you still going to\nencounter .xlsx file formats?\n\n222\n00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:01.950\nYou probably will, they still exist.\n\n223\n00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:02.890\nThey're still out there.\n\n224\n00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.190\nCuz this was back when you had to have\nit in both versions when they were kinda\n\n225\n00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:08.770\ngoing through it.\n\n226\n00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.340\nBecause from the xls to the xlsx,\n\n227\n00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:16.610\nthey put on this whole XML\nframework in the background.\n\n228\n00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:20.092\nA bunch of techy stuff that you don't need\nto know about besides it just going from,\n\n229\n00:12:20.092 --> 00:12:21.798\nit could do this to being able to do this.\n\n230\n00:12:21.798 --> 00:12:26.035\nSo the extent of the capabilities\nhave all of the Office products.\n\n231\n00:12:26.035 --> 00:12:30.390\nAnd so they had to add an extra x on\nthe end to, you could say, extend it,\n\n232\n00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:36.530\nwhatever you want to say, but it just made\nit to where it's a different type of file.\n\n233\n00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:42.140\nDocuments, or Word files, or\n.docx, PowerPoints are PPTX.\n\n234\n00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:45.370\nSo just knowing that those exist and\n\n235\n00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:49.760\nthat if you do open an xls,\nI always have to slow down and\n\n236\n00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.040\nenunciate each one of those letters\n[LAUGH] cuz it's really easy to mess up.\n\n237\n00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:57.720\nYou can still open those files, but\nyou'll be in compatibility mode.\n\n238\n00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:02.270\nAnd if you do certain\nthings in Excel 2016, and\n\n239\n00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:09.840\nyou save it down to a lower version, the\nxls, you could lose some functionality or\n\n240\n00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:15.790\nsome visual effects to your files because\nit just can't support it anymore.\n\n241\n00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:19.840\nIt's old, so you wanna try and\nstick with the new stuff.\n\n242\n00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:24.271\nAnd I always like to kinda throw\na little bit more history.\n\n243\n00:13:24.271 --> 00:13:31.249\nAnd this is in the Wikipedia,\ngot it out of my mouth, okay, very good.\n\n244\n00:13:31.249 --> 00:13:34.415\nIt's fun to read about this but\nit's just showing the history.\n\n245\n00:13:34.415 --> 00:13:39.331\nI know this is really small for you to not\nnecessarily have to read on the screen but\n\n246\n00:13:39.331 --> 00:13:43.888\nI just thought it was fun that it was\nMicrosoft released the first version of\n\n247\n00:13:43.888 --> 00:13:47.463\nExcel for\nthe Macintosh on September 30th, 1985.\n\n248\n00:13:47.463 --> 00:13:50.545\nWow, how old was I?\n\n249\n00:13:50.545 --> 00:13:51.441\nI wasn't even ten yet.\n\n250\n00:13:51.441 --> 00:13:55.915\nSo, [LAUGH] yeah, so,\nthen it says the first Windows\n\n251\n00:13:55.915 --> 00:13:59.792\nversion was 2.05 in November 1987.\n\n252\n00:13:59.792 --> 00:14:01.716\nSo this has a little bit of history.\n\n253\n00:14:01.716 --> 00:14:05.115\nAnd do you remember Lotus Notes?\n&gt;&gt; I remember Lotus.\n\n254\n00:14:05.115 --> 00:14:09.135\nThere was kinda this Office suite wars,\nright?\n\n255\n00:14:09.135 --> 00:14:11.980\nDuring the early 90s, kinda early 90s-ish.\n\n256\n00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:15.550\nWhere I'm from,\nmaybe we're behind a little bit.\n\n257\n00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:16.905\nSo it may have been late 80s.\n\n258\n00:14:16.905 --> 00:14:20.955\nI will tell you, Vonne, I wasn't too old,\nso I don't remember a whole lot.\n\n259\n00:14:20.955 --> 00:14:22.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n260\n00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:26.172\nI was definitely not using\ncomputers by then or Excel.\n\n261\n00:14:26.172 --> 00:14:31.165\nNow, ten-year-olds can probably do all\nsorts of wonderful things on Excel.\n\n262\n00:14:31.165 --> 00:14:35.100\nBut Lotus one, two, three that was like\nthe one that in this Wikipedia article,\n\n263\n00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:38.420\nif you read it,\nthere was some weird hidden\n\n264\n00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:42.988\nEaster egg that if you did\na sequential numbers of one, two,\n\n265\n00:14:42.988 --> 00:14:48.230\nthree that this thing would come and\njump down on it and squash it.\n\n266\n00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:50.410\nAnd it was this kinda, haha, yeah,\n\n267\n00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:53.730\nwe won type thing that Microsoft\nput in there software.\n\n268\n00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:56.516\nI don't know if it's true, who knows?\n\n269\n00:14:56.516 --> 00:15:00.330\nBut I just thought it was a fun little\npiece of trivia, so read that article,\n\n270\n00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.597\nit's a little fun, so-\n&gt;&gt; Vonne, I've heard of Microsoft just\n\n271\n00:15:03.597 --> 00:15:07.046\nthrowing things in there,\nwhere they thought it was a good idea.\n\n272\n00:15:07.046 --> 00:15:09.376\nAnd then every once in a while,\nit's come back to bite them.\n\n273\n00:15:09.376 --> 00:15:10.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n274\n00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:11.320\n&gt;&gt; I think they actually put\n\n275\n00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.240\na worm that asked you for a product code.\n\n276\n00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:16.260\nAnd if you couldn't produce it during\none of their previous releases,\n\n277\n00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:17.910\nthen it would lock up your computer.\n\n278\n00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:19.580\nThey actually got in some trouble.\n\n279\n00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:23.040\nThis is hearsay, right,\nwho knows if it's true or not?\n\n280\n00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.653\nBut it does make for a good story.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] right, Excel folklore.\n\n281\n00:15:26.653 --> 00:15:29.904\n[LAUGH] Exactly, all right.\n\n282\n00:15:29.904 --> 00:15:32.994\nSo anyway, I just kinda wanted to threw\nthat in there, and that's why we're not\n\n283\n00:15:32.994 --> 00:15:35.910\nrunning the PowerPoint presentation\nas an actual slideshow.\n\n284\n00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:37.232\nWhy don't we keep on going?\n\n285\n00:15:37.232 --> 00:15:40.480\nI'm gonna go ahead and collapse the notes\nand then move onto the next slide.\n\n286\n00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.130\nSo, yep, file extensions.\n\n287\n00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:44.155\nI'm a fan of showing them.\n\n288\n00:15:44.155 --> 00:15:45.281\nI just like to.\n\n289\n00:15:45.281 --> 00:15:47.780\nI like to know what I'm working with.\n\n290\n00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:51.265\nSo that is something that you can\ndo in your Finder preferences.\n\n291\n00:15:51.265 --> 00:15:55.483\nSo if you just go to the Finder &gt;\nPreferences, you can go ahead and\n\n292\n00:15:55.483 --> 00:15:57.645\nturn those on so you can see them.\n\n293\n00:15:57.645 --> 00:16:01.209\nIt's just something I've always\nlived with I guess you could say.\n\n294\n00:16:01.209 --> 00:16:03.252\nI like them.\n\n295\n00:16:03.252 --> 00:16:06.654\nOne thing to be careful about when you\nstart putting extensions you don't wanna\n\n296\n00:16:06.654 --> 00:16:08.200\never erase the extension.\n\n297\n00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.080\nThen it can mess things up.\n\n298\n00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:15.160\nI think Windows is a little\neasier to do that than a Mac.\n\n299\n00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:20.870\nYou can still do it, but don't want to\ndo anything past the dot in your files,\n\n300\n00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:23.770\nbecause that will mess things up.\n&gt;&gt; And you're talking about\n\n301\n00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:27.290\ndoing like a file rename or something\nlike that, if you're showing extensions.\n\n302\n00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:29.340\nIt's not, go hide them again.\n\n303\n00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.060\nThat's not gonna mess anything up.\n\n304\n00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.950\nIt's if I click on there and\nremove that X from PPTX,\n\n305\n00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:38.360\nyou may get weird behavior like it\nthinks it's a different kind of file,\n\n306\n00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:42.260\nand don't do it, it's bad.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, not the showing and\n\n307\n00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.930\nthe hiding and the renaming process,\n\n308\n00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:46.800\nthat's where it can get\na little wonky sometimes.\n\n309\n00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.880\nBut it's something that I like to\njust show people that you can do.\n\n310\n00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.714\nIf you're not used to them you don't have\nto turn them on, you really don't because\n\n311\n00:16:53.714 --> 00:16:57.280\nwhen you look at the details view it's\ngonna tell you what type of file that is.\n\n312\n00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.670\nSo if you wanna keep it\nwith that totally fine.\n\n313\n00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:05.560\nSo a little bit about our set up here\nof what I'm going to be showing you.\n\n314\n00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.800\nIs that I have a locally\ninstalled version of Excel 2016.\n\n315\n00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:13.530\nI do have an Office 365 account.\n\n316\n00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:19.900\nAnd I'm on an Enterprise3 License\nan E3 license, ooh yeah it's fancy.\n\n317\n00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:25.770\nThat goes all the way to E5 we have\nat another account as well but\n\n318\n00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:30.660\nthis particular one it is an E3 so\ndefinitely check out what yours is, but\n\n319\n00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:35.820\nI also am using the MacOS Sierra\nat this particular time.\n\n320\n00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:39.240\nHigh Sierra is out but I have not\nupgraded to it because it does some\n\n321\n00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.220\nweird things with our\nstuff here in our studios.\n\n322\n00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:45.190\nSo that's the version of\nsoftware that I'm using.\n\n323\n00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:51.930\nI'm also on version 16.11 and\nthat actually just happened today.\n\n324\n00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:54.840\nI love when Microsoft updates my shows,\nright in the middle of them,\n\n325\n00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.490\nI film these out of order sometimes.\n\n326\n00:17:56.490 --> 00:18:00.520\nThis is actually the last day of this\nparticular series that I'm filming.\n\n327\n00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:01.830\nI always come back around.\n\n328\n00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:05.920\nSo yep, I went ahead and\nit's upgraded to this particular version.\n\n329\n00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.190\nThey love to do that to me.\n\n330\n00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:10.199\nIt happens pretty much every show\nthat I do, it goes ahead and\n\n331\n00:18:10.199 --> 00:18:11.476\nupdates in the middle.\n\n332\n00:18:11.476 --> 00:18:14.890\nAnd that's just something that\nhappens to Office 365, so if yours\n\n333\n00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:19.685\nis a little different that might be why.\n&gt;&gt; And, Vonne, just to comment on that.\n\n334\n00:18:19.685 --> 00:18:22.605\nIt's frustrating for\nus because of the jobs that we do.\n\n335\n00:18:22.605 --> 00:18:26.630\nHowever for you that means that\nyou get quicker security updates,\n\n336\n00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:28.770\nyou get more features faster.\n\n337\n00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:33.270\nYou get features, usually large releases\nor large feature sets with tiny\n\n338\n00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:36.410\nlittle features, maybe pushed\nout in these smaller releases.\n\n339\n00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:38.530\nOffice 365 makes that possible.\n\n340\n00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:42.680\nIt used to be those old versions of Excel,\nyou waited three years for\n\n341\n00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.990\nnew stuff, and you waited three years for\npossible security patches,\n\n342\n00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:51.000\nunless it was of utmost urgency and\nthen they fixed it at that time.\n\n343\n00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.700\nSo, this is better for you and kind of\nmakes our lives a little harder sometimes.\n\n344\n00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and the updates for Mac and\n\n345\n00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.020\nPC are usually different too.\n\n346\n00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:04.720\nSo, this is for the most recent version\nat this time of the recording for Mac.\n\n347\n00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.950\nAnd then, yes, like I said, your set up.\n\n348\n00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:12.530\nYou do need to be aware of what you're\nlooking at versus what I'm showing you,\n\n349\n00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:14.130\nbecause there might be differences.\n\n350\n00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:17.940\nAnd the way that you can tell what\nsubscription level you're on,\n\n351\n00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:21.020\nyou can go to your Office 365 account and\ngo to My Account and\n\n352\n00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:24.410\nlook at your subscriptions, and\nit'll tell you what version it is.\n\n353\n00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:26.660\nYou can also open up your Excel program.\n\n354\n00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:30.970\nGo to the Excel menu, do About Excel,\nand you can see what version your on.\n\n355\n00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:36.570\nAnd, yeah, if you're on a little bit\nolder version, even if you're on like,\n\n356\n00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:39.680\n2013, and you're not on 2016,\na lot of this stuff will still apply.\n\n357\n00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.590\nThe basics throughout everything in Excel.\n\n358\n00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:47.370\nI've honestly been teaching a lot of\nthe same stuff for the last, a long time.\n\n359\n00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:48.080\n10, 12, 15.\n\n360\n00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.565\nWow, it's been a long time.\n\n361\n00:19:50.565 --> 00:19:55.090\n[LAUGH] So\na lot of that stuff doesn't change.\n\n362\n00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:58.240\nYeah, they add a couple new features\nhere and there, and that's great.\n\n363\n00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:01.250\nAnd if you can't see, like,\nI don't know what version.\n\n364\n00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:02.500\nIt's not letting me.\n\n365\n00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:06.780\nIf you're in a large enterprise or\na large organization,\n\n366\n00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:11.190\nyou might have some of this stuff locked\ndown to where you can't see that stuff.\n\n367\n00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:16.100\nOkay, there's a lot of stuff in\nnetworking that kinda locks things down.\n\n368\n00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:19.980\nSo if you want, ask them,\nyou know, hey what version am I on?\n\n369\n00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.340\nWhy can't I do certain things?\n\n370\n00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:27.970\nThat is a total other arena that it got\na lot of other parameters and factors that\n\n371\n00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:33.870\ncan affect what you see and what you can\nand cannot do in some of these products.\n\n372\n00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:35.800\nAnd then updates, right?\n\n373\n00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:39.650\nThey're gonna happen, and\nmaybe you're watching this later and\n\n374\n00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:42.040\nthere's been quite a few updates so\nthere's some new buttons there.\n\n375\n00:20:43.354 --> 00:20:46.190\nAnd that's just, as Justin said,\nthe beauty of being able to have these\n\n376\n00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:49.160\nincremental updates so they go ahead and\ngive you some new features.\n\n377\n00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:52.850\nSo, just to let you know that there\ncould be some slight variations.\n\n378\n00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:55.770\nSo, check out your setup and\nsee how it goes.\n\n379\n00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:56.680\nBut guess what?\n\n380\n00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:00.420\nThat's the end of my slide show, and\nsomething I always like to start off\n\n381\n00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:04.525\nall of my essential series is just kind\nof get a nice overview of where we're at,\n\n382\n00:21:04.525 --> 00:21:06.130\nwhat we're gonna do.\n\n383\n00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:08.310\nAnd yeah, then we're gonna move on and\n\n384\n00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:11.220\ndo some fun things in Excel.\n&gt;&gt; Well Vonne you've definitely given\n\n385\n00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:12.190\na nice foundation.\n\n386\n00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:15.710\nRemoved possibly some jargon issues,\nrows, columns, cells,\n\n387\n00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:17.650\nwhat is all that shenanigans?\n\n388\n00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:20.480\nYou've made sure that we\nall start at the same time.\n\n389\n00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.600\nAnd well, speaking of starting,\nwe're just getting started.\n\n390\n00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.160\nSo you should definitely come on back.\n\n391\n00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.930\nBut for now we're gonna go ahead and\nget outta here.\n\n392\n00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:28.910\nSo signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n393\n00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:29.750\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n394\n00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:31.540\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n395\n00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:36.069\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

OFFICEPRO.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.525\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and\nwe're coming back at you with Excel 2016\n\n4\n00:00:20.525 --> 00:00:24.785\nessentials for Mac and we're gonna\nbe looking at Excel basics today and\n\n5\n00:00:24.785 --> 00:00:29.685\nI'm a little rusty on mine, but luckily\nwe have someone in the studio who's not,\n\n6\n00:00:29.685 --> 00:00:31.898\nthe one, the only Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:31.898 --> 00:00:33.546\nHow are you doing today Vonne?\n&gt;&gt; I'm feeling great\n\n8\n00:00:33.546 --> 00:00:35.100\nafter that introduction\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n9\n00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.546\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, you're right we are gonna\n\n10\n00:00:37.546 --> 00:00:42.070\nstart at the very beginning because\nwe went over our history of Excel.\n\n11\n00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.247\nWe want everybody to know we're working\nwith a spreadsheet application and\n\n12\n00:00:46.247 --> 00:00:47.950\nnow we're gonna get started.\n\n13\n00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.770\nWe're gonna open up Excel and\nthen we're gonna make some new files.\n\n14\n00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:53.580\nMake some new?\n\n15\n00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.700\nWe're gonna make some new files, okay?\n\n16\n00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.225\nAnd yeah, that was really bad, sorry.\n\n17\n00:00:57.225 --> 00:01:00.090\n[LAUGH] But just kind of\ngetting familiar with work and\n\n18\n00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.570\nwith our Windows and\nwhat is save, save as,\n\n19\n00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.730\nclose, all of those functional things\nthat you need to know to get started.\n\n20\n00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.210\nSo we are going to jump\ndown into my computer, and\n\n21\n00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.092\nyou can see that I've got\na pretty clean desktop.\n\n22\n00:01:15.092 --> 00:01:20.230\nDon't mind this little file right here,\nI was working over the lunch\n\n23\n00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.860\nbreak on an InDesign file, and I don't\nknow if I wanna delete that or not.\n\n24\n00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:25.750\nSo, you know what?\n\n25\n00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.890\nI'm just gonna let it sit there for\na little bit.\n\n26\n00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.220\nSo we've got two folders on here and\nwe're gonna be working with some files.\n\n27\n00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.750\nYou guys really don't\nneed to see this one, but\n\n28\n00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.640\nyou will have your own exercise files\nthat you are able to follow along with.\n\n29\n00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.550\nI don't necessarily have them all listed,\nI'm just gonna be opening up random.\n\n30\n00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.190\nSo just,\npick any of them that you so choose.\n\n31\n00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.490\nBut first of all,\nExcel is installed locally on my machine.\n\n32\n00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.180\nI have an Office 365 account,\nI've already signed into it as well.\n\n33\n00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.270\nSo this first time you ever launch Excel,\n\n34\n00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.910\nyou will need to sign\nin with that account.\n\n35\n00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.290\nAll of those steps are already\ngoing to be done for me.\n\n36\n00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.770\nSo how do I open it?\n\n37\n00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.270\nI know, Justin, that you are big component\nof the spotlight feature on a Mac,\n\n38\n00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.370\nso am I.\n\n39\n00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.000\nSpotlight is just a way,\nit's like a search.\n\n40\n00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.470\nIt's up here on the upper right\nhand corner of your desktop, but\n\n41\n00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.370\nthe other way that you can do\nit is on a keyboard shortcut.\n\n42\n00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.910\nI love keyboard shortcuts, but\ndoesn't mean you have to use them.\n\n43\n00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.210\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n44\n00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.720\nBut it is the command and the space bar\ntogether and it'll allow you to bring up\n\n45\n00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.980\nthat spotlight on your computer,\nand then you can type in the ex for\n\n46\n00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.700\nExcel and it will populate right there,\nand it will just show me that,\n\n47\n00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.290\nhey, there's Excel.\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne, I do wanna bring attention,\n\n48\n00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.670\nthere are times where I've\ntried to use spotlight for\n\n49\n00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.090\na newly installed application, and\nif it doesn't immediately show up,\n\n50\n00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.250\njust give it a little bit of time.\n\n51\n00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.190\nMaybe you have to give it a little\nmore time than you would like, but\n\n52\n00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.240\nthe spotlight works on indexing,\n\n53\n00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.030\nlike searching your file system and seeing\nwhat's available on your file system.\n\n54\n00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.245\nSo if you don't see it immediately, don't\nflip out, it sometimes just takes a little\n\n55\n00:03:08.245 --> 00:03:11.140\nbit to propagate to Spotlight.\n&gt;&gt; Definitely a good point.\n\n56\n00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.430\nYeah, because we are talking\nabout a fresh install.\n\n57\n00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.710\nYou've never even done this before, so\nit might not work the very first time, but\n\n58\n00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.610\nthat's okay, we have other ways to do it.\n\n59\n00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.830\nI'm gonna hit the Escape key on my\nkeyboard, or I can just click off.\n\n60\n00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.020\nI think I could just click out of it and\nthat'll be fine too.\n\n61\n00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.800\nBut this button down here in my dock,\nit's called the Launchpad.\n\n62\n00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.720\nI rarely go here [LAUGH], but\n\n63\n00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.350\nit is a place that you can start just\nlike a launching out into space and\n\n64\n00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.490\neverything, you might feel that way\nsometimes when you're doing this.\n\n65\n00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.760\nAnd then you can see that I\ncan scroll back and forth, and\n\n66\n00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.420\nI can open up Excel from here.\n\n67\n00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.790\nTotally fine whichever way you\nwant to do it, just go ahead and\n\n68\n00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.810\nget the application and then start it up.\n\n69\n00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.570\nNow I know that I have\nthis application open,\n\n70\n00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.430\nI know because it's got\nthe good old menu bar.\n\n71\n00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.390\nI do, I do love me a menu bar.\n\n72\n00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.690\nAnd I'm so glad that all of our\nOffice products from Mac still\n\n73\n00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.440\nhave that ingrained in it,\nso makes me happy.\n\n74\n00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.340\nAnd then I also know down here on my doc.\n\n75\n00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.020\nI know my doc is really small, and\nit's okay if it's not super visible but\n\n76\n00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.570\nthere's a little black dot.\n\n77\n00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.280\nI forgot my zoom yes,\nI have a little zoom down there.\n\n78\n00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.550\nThe little dot that lets me know\nthat Excel is the open application\n\n79\n00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:19.370\nthat I'm working in.\n\n80\n00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.574\nAnd this is my start screen.\n\n81\n00:04:21.574 --> 00:04:24.435\nNow mine's really big\nbecause my resolution and\n\n82\n00:04:24.435 --> 00:04:29.176\neverything is a little bumped up for you\nguys to see, but the first thing it starts\n\n83\n00:04:29.176 --> 00:04:34.430\nwith is the new document and that's where\nI could start a blank new document.\n\n84\n00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.968\nSounds pretty straight forward, but\nthe other things that are in here,\n\n85\n00:04:37.968 --> 00:04:39.479\nthese are known as templates.\n\n86\n00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.887\nThese are templates that are associated\nwith your Office 365, so\n\n87\n00:04:43.887 --> 00:04:48.380\nyou do need to have an internet\nconnection and you have to be signed in.\n\n88\n00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.345\nLike, I watched you, and\nwe were doing episodes for\n\n89\n00:04:51.345 --> 00:04:55.380\nDesk Pro before this and\nyou couldn't open up, was it, Word?\n\n90\n00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.440\nYeah, cuz you weren't signed in.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n91\n00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.760\nyou definitely have to make sure you sign,\nespecially if you're using these licensing\n\n92\n00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.930\noptions, because it kinda just brings up\nthe sign in screen until you sign in.\n\n93\n00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.315\nThat's as far as you can go.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n94\n00:05:06.315 --> 00:05:07.420\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So if you're like,\n\n95\n00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.510\nI don't see this screen, just make sure\nyou sign in and everything's good to go.\n\n96\n00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.700\nAnd there are features that\ncome along with signing in,\n\n97\n00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.948\nso don't fret over having to sign in.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's just the name of the game and\n\n98\n00:05:18.948 --> 00:05:22.587\nthat's how they do our subscription\nbased products, and that's what we got.\n\n99\n00:05:22.587 --> 00:05:26.811\nAnd you can see that up here on the top\nleft hand corner I am signed in,\n\n100\n00:05:26.811 --> 00:05:31.482\nas of course the Justin Timberlake,\njust me as Justin Timberlake we don't\n\n101\n00:05:31.482 --> 00:05:35.160\nwant to get in trouble there [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; I was definitely getting concerned that\n\n102\n00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.390\nyou had somehow acquired my passwords-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n103\n00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.111\n&gt;&gt; And I was like,\n\n104\n00:05:38.111 --> 00:05:40.230\nman I'm gonna have to change\nthose after the show.\n\n105\n00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:41.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, so\n\n106\n00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.670\nyou can see I'm signed in and\nyou can search for templates.\n\n107\n00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:46.120\nThese are just starting\npoints that you can,\n\n108\n00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.490\nI know that there's a loan amortization\nyou can put in some money and\n\n109\n00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.650\nthen realize how much you're bleeding out\nevery time that you have to pay interest.\n\n110\n00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.870\nIt's kind of sad but\nthey have some pre-made things in there.\n\n111\n00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.870\nSo, explore and see where they are and\nespecially if you're brand new to Excel,\n\n112\n00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.010\nit might be a fun place to start.\n\n113\n00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.940\nBut they might be a little daunting,\nbecause they have so\n\n114\n00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.230\nmuch extra formatting.\n\n115\n00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.575\nYou might wanna just start with a blank\nnew worksheet to get you started.\n\n116\n00:06:09.575 --> 00:06:11.770\nBut a few other things down\nin the left hand side,\n\n117\n00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:16.240\nwe have our reasons that would be,\nthe things that I have recently used and\n\n118\n00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.470\nyou can see I've got things like\nthe Christmas cats example, and there's\n\n119\n00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.050\nsomething else that I used for tracking\nsome of my clients work and everything.\n\n120\n00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.950\nSo I've got all of this here.\n\n121\n00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:29.040\nOne thing I will point out about our\nrecent, is that you can't clear it.\n\n122\n00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.792\nIn your PC,\nyou can clear your most recent files.\n\n123\n00:06:32.792 --> 00:06:35.300\nIt's just a reminder of\nwhat you've been using.\n\n124\n00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.990\nYou can't do that in a Mac.\n\n125\n00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:42.000\nI have a link to a web article\non the answers.microsoft.com\n\n126\n00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.520\nin the episode notes if you'd like\nto have some more information.\n\n127\n00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.484\nIt really just says you can't do it.\n\n128\n00:06:47.484 --> 00:06:51.395\nBut the other thing about the recent is\nyou have this thing called pinned up here\n\n129\n00:06:51.395 --> 00:06:54.695\nat the top, and this is just,\nit's kind of like your favorites.\n\n130\n00:06:54.695 --> 00:06:57.450\nJust like if you bookmark\nanything in your web browser,\n\n131\n00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:02.970\nyou just want to remember something,\nyou can pin it up into this recent area.\n\n132\n00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.210\nNow if you notice,\nI don't have anything pinned.\n\n133\n00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:08.910\nSo, cuz I wanted to show\nyou how you could do it.\n\n134\n00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.330\nNow of course you would have\nto have some open files.\n\n135\n00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.540\nIf you're brand new, your recents\nare gonna be completely blank, but\n\n136\n00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:19.480\nlet's say I use this one quite frequently,\nand do notice that I have different\n\n137\n00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:24.740\npaths in here that I might have\nfiles that look like the same name.\n\n138\n00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:29.670\nBut you can see that I've ot,\nthis is actually in my Dropbox folder,\n\n139\n00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.980\nand this one is on my desktop.\n\n140\n00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.510\nSo you have to be a little bit\n\n141\n00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:39.590\naware of where things are stored\nwhen you're looking at this.\n\n142\n00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:40.580\nSo just be aware.\n\n143\n00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.972\nBut let's say I use this one a lot,\nI want to mark this.\n\n144\n00:07:43.972 --> 00:07:48.664\nOver on the right hand side, it's kind of\nhard to see cuz it's blue right now, but\n\n145\n00:07:48.664 --> 00:07:50.927\nthere's this little pin right there.\n\n146\n00:07:50.927 --> 00:07:56.441\nIf you click it that means that that\nhas become a pinned document within\n\n147\n00:07:56.441 --> 00:08:02.339\nmy recents, and now you can see that\nit's Kinda just over here on the side.\n\n148\n00:08:02.339 --> 00:08:05.920\nSo it's another way of sorting almost?\n\n149\n00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.284\nNothing that you're going to\nbe most frequently using, and\n\n150\n00:08:10.284 --> 00:08:13.887\nit comes from your Recent,\nso just double check.\n\n151\n00:08:13.887 --> 00:08:15.393\nThat's kinda a cute little\nfeature that I like.\n\n152\n00:08:15.393 --> 00:08:16.427\n&gt;&gt; And I think of this as,\n\n153\n00:08:16.427 --> 00:08:19.748\nmaybe I'm a little old school here,\nactually using a bulletin board and\n\n154\n00:08:19.748 --> 00:08:22.744\npinning something to the bulletin board so\nI don't forget it, so\n\n155\n00:08:22.744 --> 00:08:26.250\nit doesn't kind of get mixed up in the\nshuffle or I throw it away on accident.\n\n156\n00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.072\nSo it's always there.\n\n157\n00:08:28.072 --> 00:08:29.910\nNow, follow-up question about this Recent.\n\n158\n00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:34.390\nWe can't clear it, but\nhow far back does Recent actually go?\n\n159\n00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:37.660\nOr is it just like Recent\nis a relative thing?\n\n160\n00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:38.630\n&gt;&gt; You know what,\n\n161\n00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:40.400\nI don't know the exact answer.\n\n162\n00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:46.770\nI'm gonna go with relative cuz it sounds\ngood, but it does go pretty far back.\n\n163\n00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:48.600\nI mean, this is a pretty extensive list.\n\n164\n00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.475\nI've been using this account for\nquite some time.\n\n165\n00:08:50.475 --> 00:08:56.140\nIt also might have a factor in\nhow many files you open up.\n\n166\n00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.620\nYou might work in Excel all day long,\nand so\n\n167\n00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:05.020\nmaybe that Recent won't hold as much\ncuz you're just opening so many files.\n\n168\n00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:09.187\nSo I would say, Google, [LAUGH].\n\n169\n00:09:09.187 --> 00:09:13.707\nI would actually have to look that up and\nsee what the threshold is for\n\n170\n00:09:13.707 --> 00:09:14.670\nhow far back.\n\n171\n00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:17.620\nSo I'm sure there is\na cut off at some point.\n\n172\n00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:18.820\n&gt;&gt; I would probably agree with that, but\n\n173\n00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:22.870\nI think that draws attention to,\nif you're unsure about these things and\n\n174\n00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:27.350\nyou know you need to have the Christmas\ncats all the time, you should probably pin\n\n175\n00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:32.140\nthat so it doesn't get flushed out of\nyour recents and you know where it is.\n\n176\n00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:37.660\nSo that's a nice kind of contrast\nto Recent versus pinned and\n\n177\n00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.760\nwhy we would need both columns.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n178\n00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.670\nand not always rely on\nit always being there.\n\n179\n00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:45.070\nJust know your file structure,\nand it's sometimes hard for me.\n\n180\n00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.225\nI've done it where I'm like,\nI don't remember where I put it.\n\n181\n00:09:47.225 --> 00:09:50.700\nBut wait, I just had that last week,\nlet me check the Recent.\n\n182\n00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:55.160\nAnd I look at that path, and\nit reminds, that's where it's at.\n\n183\n00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.490\nOkay, cool,\nthat's where I can remember it.\n\n184\n00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:01.220\nSo, good point, and it's nice to\nknow that we do have that Recent.\n\n185\n00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:02.945\nJust going down from the rest of them.\n\n186\n00:10:02.945 --> 00:10:07.840\nShared, you would have to have\n\n187\n00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:12.791\na shared workbook that, well,\nsomebody shared with you, okay,\n\n188\n00:10:12.791 --> 00:10:16.070\nthat you have to have a permission for\nyou to access.\n\n189\n00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:19.256\nThis is a lot of times where you're\nworking on a networks drive,\n\n190\n00:10:19.256 --> 00:10:21.130\nmaybe a cloud drive.\n\n191\n00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:23.700\nIt doesn't mean that it's connecting\nto your OneDrive account or\n\n192\n00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.000\nany of your cloud storage.\n\n193\n00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.840\nIt's very specific to somebody\nsharing a workbook with you and\n\n194\n00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.720\nkind of like a shortcut way to get there.\n\n195\n00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.080\nBecause this is of course where\nwe're starting, different places.\n\n196\n00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.994\nThe other thing is like, hey, I wanna\nopen up a file that I already have.\n\n197\n00:10:39.994 --> 00:10:42.940\nWell, you've got Open right there.\n\n198\n00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:47.810\nNow notice that it will connect to my\ndifferent OneDrive accounts because\n\n199\n00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:50.176\nI'm signed into my Office 365.\n\n200\n00:10:50.176 --> 00:10:55.380\nSo I could go into these\ndifferent cloud storage places.\n\n201\n00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.730\nTotally fine, but I know I have files.\n\n202\n00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:00.680\nWe saw it over here on my desktop.\n\n203\n00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:05.370\nSo, if I wanted to go to files on my Mac,\nyou just click on my Mac.\n\n204\n00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:09.700\nAnd then it brings you out to\na kinda old school place in\n\n205\n00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:14.770\nthe Finder of where you can go to on your\ndesktop over here on your right hand.\n\n206\n00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:18.020\nThat would be the other right there,\nJustin, that would be the left.\n\n207\n00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:21.570\nAnd these are different things that\nyou can mark off with your favorites.\n\n208\n00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:25.557\nAnd then I can go into a specific folder,\nfind an Excel file.\n\n209\n00:11:25.557 --> 00:11:29.970\nYou can change your views with\nthe different icons versus list views.\n\n210\n00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:34.766\nMore of like a Mac OS type of tutorials,\nI would say,\n\n211\n00:11:34.766 --> 00:11:38.479\nbut then I can open up a particular file.\n\n212\n00:11:38.479 --> 00:11:42.666\nNow, maybe I don't really want to open\nanything up right now, and I'm like, okay,\n\n213\n00:11:42.666 --> 00:11:44.490\nI just wanna cancel it out.\n\n214\n00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:48.550\nSo I click on Cancel, and I'm like,\nwait, wait, so, where did it go?\n\n215\n00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:54.221\nJust one of those little nuances when\nyou cancel out is that that Start menu,\n\n216\n00:11:54.221 --> 00:11:57.886\nit kinda disappears, but\nit's kinda not completely gone.\n\n217\n00:11:57.886 --> 00:11:59.980\nIt's that weird stuff.\n\n218\n00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:05.060\nNotice down here, if I click Excel down in\nmy dock, the Start menu will come back,\n\n219\n00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:10.410\nor the Start screen, I should say,\ncan come back up and we can go from there.\n\n220\n00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:13.789\nBut of course you always\nhave your File menu, so\n\n221\n00:12:13.789 --> 00:12:18.956\nif this little Start screen doesn't\nget there, you can do a File &gt; New.\n\n222\n00:12:18.956 --> 00:12:20.497\nYou can do it from Template.\n\n223\n00:12:20.497 --> 00:12:24.910\nThat'll actually open up onto your Finder,\nlike your actual computer.\n\n224\n00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:29.490\nAnd then you can open, so\ndon't get too crazy on relying on\n\n225\n00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:32.790\nthe Start screen if it goes away.\n&gt;&gt; Now that's\n\n226\n00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:34.390\na pretty ubiquitous behavior for\n\n227\n00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:39.000\nMac is the application isn't necessarily\nclosed when the window is closed.\n\n228\n00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.650\nSo if you're new to Mac, and\nwhen you're also learning Excel,\n\n229\n00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:42.820\njust keep that in mind.\n\n230\n00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.580\nLook for\nthat little black dot at the bottom\n\n231\n00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:46.160\nthat says that application's\nstill running.\n\n232\n00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.090\nClick on the icon, it'll bring it back up.\n\n233\n00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:50.670\nI do have a follow-up question\nabout the Shared and Open.\n\n234\n00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:55.610\nSo Shared are shared workbooks\nfrom some capacity, right?\n\n235\n00:12:55.610 --> 00:13:00.750\nThey could be online or through some kind\nof maybe exchange or something like that?\n\n236\n00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.160\nBut if I wanted to come and\nopen something, let's say,\n\n237\n00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:08.150\non an external hard drive that someone has\nhanded to me, would that be under Shared\n\n238\n00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:12.331\nor would that be under the Open portion?\n&gt;&gt; It would be under Open\n\n239\n00:13:12.331 --> 00:13:17.334\nbecause it's on a separate\nexternal location.\n\n240\n00:13:17.334 --> 00:13:22.550\nAnd the Shared is when it has\nspecific permissions on the file.\n\n241\n00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:26.310\nAnd it would be more in\na network-type situation,\n\n242\n00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:30.930\nlike, I know while working back at\nthe university, we all opened up\n\n243\n00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:35.900\nthe same shared Excel file all the time,\nbecause we were all working.\n\n244\n00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.580\nBut then it's like always locked for\nediting, and then you have to call, hey,\n\n245\n00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:39.990\ncan you like close the Excel file?\n\n246\n00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.710\nOkay, yeah.\n\n247\n00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:43.070\nSo if you're familiar\nwith that type of set up,\n\n248\n00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:46.190\nthen you're like,\nI know about shared workbooks.\n\n249\n00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:49.920\nBut it is more, I guess I mean,\nworkflow specific\n\n250\n00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:55.140\non how your office works\nwith particular platform.\n\n251\n00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:58.340\nSo that's my answer for that one [LAUGH].\n\n252\n00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.609\nEverything is that mileage may vary,\nas you always like to say,\n\n253\n00:14:00.609 --> 00:14:02.230\nwhich I like to use, too.\n\n254\n00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:04.920\nOkay, perfect, so I've got these\ndifferent ways that I can get started.\n\n255\n00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.860\nI know I have my menu, all right?\n\n256\n00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.810\nThe old school menu type stuff.\n\n257\n00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:10.460\nI have my Start screen.\n\n258\n00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:15.140\nSo what we're gonna do is we're gonna\njust get familiar with our basics of\n\n259\n00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:19.870\nusing the Windows-like atmosphere\nof this particular program.\n\n260\n00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:21.259\nI'm gonna click New.\n\n261\n00:14:21.259 --> 00:14:22.530\nI'm gonna click Blank Workbook.\n\n262\n00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:25.480\nI can go ahead and double-click on it, but\n\n263\n00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.830\nhere I'm just gonna make this a little\nbit smaller so you can see it.\n\n264\n00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:29.630\nThere is a Create button\ndown at the bottom.\n\n265\n00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:33.410\nSo as long as you have it highlighted and\nthere's a little green box around it,\n\n266\n00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:38.940\nyou click Create, it will go ahead and\ncreate a brand new workbook.\n\n267\n00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:43.020\nThat's the type of files that\nwe're working with within Excel.\n\n268\n00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.416\n[LAUGH] I almost forgot what I was doing.\n\n269\n00:14:45.416 --> 00:14:46.170\nIt happens all the time.\n\n270\n00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:47.630\nSo we have our workbook.\n\n271\n00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:52.180\nNow this across the top,\nthis is known as your Title bar.\n\n272\n00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:55.241\nNow we're gonna go over the interface\nin a separate episode where we\n\n273\n00:14:55.241 --> 00:14:57.832\nname all the different pieces\nof what we're looking at.\n\n274\n00:14:57.832 --> 00:15:00.040\nWe're just talking about\nthe basics of our windows.\n\n275\n00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:04.420\nSo up at the top, that's where we\nhave Book1, that's our Title bar.\n\n276\n00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:10.700\nThat's the place where you can grab\nthe window and move it around.\n\n277\n00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:12.050\nSo if I just grab it here and\n\n278\n00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:15.970\nyou Click+Hold+Drag,\nnotice I can kinda move it around.\n\n279\n00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:21.830\nAnd like Justin was saying, the window or\nfile is separate than the application.\n\n280\n00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:26.307\nSo there's two levels of openness,\nwe'll call it?\n\n281\n00:15:26.307 --> 00:15:27.627\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That sounds like\n\n282\n00:15:27.627 --> 00:15:28.264\nyou're now a mathematician.\n\n283\n00:15:28.264 --> 00:15:31.070\nThere's two levels of openness.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n284\n00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:32.812\n&gt;&gt; But they are separate entities in\n\n285\n00:15:32.812 --> 00:15:34.090\nMac OS, a lot of the time.\n\n286\n00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:37.990\nThere are a few edge cases where if you\nclose the window, an application closes.\n\n287\n00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:41.600\nBut I'm pretty sure none of the Office\nproducts have that behavior.\n\n288\n00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.977\nIt's you close the window, the application\nis still running in the background, or\n\n289\n00:15:45.977 --> 00:15:49.063\nI could be wrong about that.\n&gt;&gt; No, you are correct.\n\n290\n00:15:49.063 --> 00:15:51.138\nAnd that is different than the PC land.\n\n291\n00:15:51.138 --> 00:15:55.737\nPC land is like, I could close it, and\nit closes the whole application, so\n\n292\n00:15:55.737 --> 00:15:57.563\nthe Very much a Mac specific.\n\n293\n00:15:57.563 --> 00:16:00.453\nAnd good point out,\nyou might be using Macs for years and\n\n294\n00:16:00.453 --> 00:16:01.940\nlike, I know all of this.\n\n295\n00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:05.330\nBut maybe you've just transitioned\nover because Macs are so\n\n296\n00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.540\nmuch cooler than PCs but\nI'm not quoting that.\n\n297\n00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.215\nI'm just stating a preference.\n\n298\n00:16:10.215 --> 00:16:14.855\n[LAUGH] So\nthat's where it does work differently.\n\n299\n00:16:14.855 --> 00:16:16.728\nSo I can go ahead and move this around.\n\n300\n00:16:16.728 --> 00:16:21.890\nAnd I could take and go to the corners of\nany of my windows and I get little two\n\n301\n00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:27.070\npointed black arrows whether you're\non the side or the top or the corner.\n\n302\n00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:30.950\nAnd then, here let me zoom out, and\nthen I can go ahead and make this smaller,\n\n303\n00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:34.356\nmove it around cuz maybe I'll be\nworking with multiple workbooks,\n\n304\n00:16:34.356 --> 00:16:35.570\nall that kind of thing.\n\n305\n00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:40.870\nSo different ways to manipulate\nthis particular window and\n\n306\n00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:42.860\ngrab it and move it around.\n\n307\n00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:48.800\nNow these buttons over here, all right,\nthey're on the left hand side in a Mac OS.\n\n308\n00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.090\nWe have the red,\nthe yellow, and the green.\n\n309\n00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:53.750\nAll right, so what do they do?\n\n310\n00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:55.140\nLet's start in the middle.\n\n311\n00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:58.080\nThe yellow is your minimize button.\n\n312\n00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:01.230\nWhen I click on this it's going to\nminimize this particular window.\n\n313\n00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:07.490\nAnd the way that I have my\nparticular OS preferences,\n\n314\n00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:10.300\nit's going down in here into the doc.\n\n315\n00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:16.140\nIf yours doesn't go off to the right,\nand it kinda goes down into this little\n\n316\n00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:21.110\nicon down here, the application, then\nthat's a particular system preference.\n\n317\n00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:24.630\nReally quick, again,\nmore of like a Mac OS type thing.\n\n318\n00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:28.400\nIf you go into the system preferences,\nand I believe it's in the dock,\n\n319\n00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:33.690\nthat's right here, minimize\nwindows into the application icon.\n\n320\n00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:36.020\nI do not have that checked on.\n\n321\n00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:39.680\nI prefer to have it go down in here.\n\n322\n00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:43.960\nAnd you can see there's the genie effect,\nand how large the dock is, and\n\n323\n00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.590\nall that kinda stuff.\n\n324\n00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:48.500\nWhat double-clicking the title bar,\nwhich I'll show you.\n\n325\n00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:54.790\nThis is your specific thing, okay,\nI like it, this is how I work.\n\n326\n00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:56.020\nWhat do you, you use Mac?\n\n327\n00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:59.410\nI know you're a Mac person.\n&gt;&gt; I'm a Mac person, and I actually\n\n328\n00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:03.170\nhave it collapse down to the application\nicon because I'm really notorious for\n\n329\n00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:09.375\nhaving multiple like copies running\nat the same time of the application.\n\n330\n00:18:09.375 --> 00:18:13.510\nAnd I'll have a dock full of,\n\n331\n00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:16.000\nthese are like little white screens and\nI don't know what that is.\n\n332\n00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.670\nBut then if it's in the application icon,\nI just click and\n\n333\n00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:20.840\nit gives me kind of a list.\n\n334\n00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:24.736\nI can click and hold and look at all of\nthe Excel workbooks that I have open,\n\n335\n00:18:24.736 --> 00:18:26.510\nor all of the Word\ndocuments that I have open.\n\n336\n00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:31.100\nSo on and so forth, and\nit's just an organizational tool for me.\n\n337\n00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:35.710\nSo it's definitely a personal preference.\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n\n338\n00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:36.940\nYou know,\nI didn't even think of it that way.\n\n339\n00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:39.120\nSo I like the logic of why you use that,\n\n340\n00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.875\nI'm still going to use my way,\nbut [LAUGH].\n\n341\n00:18:40.875 --> 00:18:43.740\nTo each his own,\nthat's why you have your preferences.\n\n342\n00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:48.530\nNow, if I wanted to bring this back up,\nall I gotta do is click once down here and\n\n343\n00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:50.250\nthen it brings this file back up.\n\n344\n00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:53.800\nSo that's like our minimize and maximize.\n\n345\n00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:58.400\nThis green button,\nthis is it's kinda evolved over the years.\n\n346\n00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:03.000\nThis green button will take you into\nwhat's known as full screen mode.\n\n347\n00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.683\nAnd if you're not familiar with it and\nyou first click on it,\n\n348\n00:19:05.683 --> 00:19:07.490\nyou're gonna be like what did I do?\n\n349\n00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:08.750\nWhere did everything go?\n\n350\n00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:10.450\nI don't know what's going on.\n\n351\n00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.600\nAnd it kind of freaks you out.\n\n352\n00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.140\nI know the first time that I,\nI don't remember what\n\n353\n00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:18.250\nOS I started doing this where\nthe green goes into full screen.\n\n354\n00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:20.120\nIt used to be something different.\n\n355\n00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:25.300\nBut I was just like, I did the same thing,\nI'm like, what happened [LAUGH]?\n\n356\n00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.190\nWhere did I go?\n\n357\n00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:29.450\nSo now that's the behavior.\n\n358\n00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:32.800\nI personally just don't like\nworking in full screen.\n\n359\n00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.560\nI know some people do.\n\n360\n00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.500\nAgain, I just don't.\n\n361\n00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.550\nIf I hover, now how do you get out of it?\n\n362\n00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:43.960\nIf you hover up, do you see how it brings\nthose buttons back in, the green button.\n\n363\n00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:48.010\nAnd when I click it,\nit takes me of full screen mode.\n\n364\n00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:51.414\nThis is also something that you can\ngo through in the view menu and\n\n365\n00:19:51.414 --> 00:19:53.190\nthen it enters into full screen.\n\n366\n00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:57.452\nAgain, more of a Mac-specific behavior,\nI know some people use it, and\n\n367\n00:19:57.452 --> 00:20:00.290\nyou get into multiple desktops,\nright Justin?\n\n368\n00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:04.490\nAnd then you kind of swipe back and forth.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm really bad with that,\n\n369\n00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:08.140\nand I have to tighten that down cuz\nsometimes I notice when I'm trying to\n\n370\n00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:09.690\nshow people things.\n\n371\n00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:12.490\nI'm like, well, let me switch over\nhere and let me switch over here.\n\n372\n00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:16.200\nAnd the motion you're seeing is,\non a Mac, if you don't know this,\n\n373\n00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:20.000\nyour touchpad actually has multiple\ngestures, and if you have a lot of those\n\n374\n00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.870\nfull screens, they're kinda hiding\non this other virtual desktop.\n\n375\n00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:27.570\nIt's like having a virtual monitor,\nand you can swipe back and\n\n376\n00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:28.610\nforth and get to other ones.\n\n377\n00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:32.590\nSo if you ever find yourself going,\nwhere did that window go?\n\n378\n00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:35.410\nYou may have it in full\nscreen somewhere else.\n\n379\n00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:38.930\nLook, the new default full\nscreen behavior of Macs.\n\n380\n00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:39.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\n\n381\n00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:43.362\nI just did the three finger swipe up and\nthen it shows the multiple desktops.\n\n382\n00:20:43.362 --> 00:20:46.910\nI use this, but not as much as\nI've seen some other people.\n\n383\n00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:52.570\nIt's just one of those things that it\nkind of drives me crazy, a little bit.\n\n384\n00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:55.300\nBut when I'm using virtual machines,\nI love swiping back and\n\n385\n00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:59.820\nforth and I, again, you're just gonna\nhave to figure out what ways you like.\n\n386\n00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:01.900\nBut at least you know\nwhat that button does.\n\n387\n00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:07.310\nAnd you know how to get out of it and\navoid it if you don't want to do it.\n\n388\n00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:09.100\nNow, the other buttons that we have here,\n\n389\n00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:14.160\nthe red, that's where it's gonna close\nthe file or this particular window.\n\n390\n00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.780\nSo if I click it because I\ndidn't make any changes or\n\n391\n00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:18.730\ndo anything it's not gonna\ngive me any warnings.\n\n392\n00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:22.870\nAnd now I've closed the file,\nbut not the application\n\n393\n00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:27.800\nthat's up in the Excel menu and\nthat's where I can quit Excel.\n\n394\n00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:32.560\nAnd there's times, I mean even before I\nthis show I noticed that I had like Word,\n\n395\n00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.490\nPowerpoint, Excel, the Heru pad,\nmy mark down editor.\n\n396\n00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:38.200\nI had all of these,\nI had black dots down the, I'm like oops\n\n397\n00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:42.190\nI should close all these applications\ncuz I just forgot to close them.\n\n398\n00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:46.000\nCommand Q is your keyboard shortcut\nif you're curious about that so\n\n399\n00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.020\nwe can go ahead and do that.\n\n400\n00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:51.360\nGreat so\nnow I know how I can open a program,\n\n401\n00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:55.210\nopen a file or at least start a new file,\nmove it around a little bit.\n\n402\n00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:57.590\nI'm gonna use my spotlight\ncommand space bar.\n\n403\n00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:59.960\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nopen up Excel one more time.\n\n404\n00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.343\nLet's go ahead and talk about working\nwith multiple files because you\n\n405\n00:22:04.343 --> 00:22:07.129\nwill be doing that especially\nif you're doing comparing and\n\n406\n00:22:07.129 --> 00:22:09.610\ncontrasting with some numbers and\nthings like that.\n\n407\n00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:13.620\nSo let's open a blank working,\nwell let's start a new file.\n\n408\n00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:15.500\nSo I'm gonna double-click right here.\n\n409\n00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:20.413\nAnd then I'm gonna go back to my Finder,\nbecause this just a way that I tend\n\n410\n00:22:20.413 --> 00:22:25.500\nto like to get into my particular files,\nis I go through the Finder.\n\n411\n00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:29.950\nI go on to my desktop and find, those\nare my show notes or my episode notes.\n\n412\n00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:34.730\nLet's go into the files and let's open\nup that Christmas Cats from my desktop.\n\n413\n00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:37.710\nSo now I've got two files open and\nwhy not?\n\n414\n00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:41.820\nLet's do another way, let's do a File,\nOpen, and let's open up a,\n\n415\n00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.040\ngotta go the other way.\n\n416\n00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.150\nSee this is why I like\nto go to the Finder.\n\n417\n00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:46.370\nThere's more clicks going this way.\n\n418\n00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:51.550\nAnd let's do the, you know what,\nlet's do Navigate, let's do that one.\n\n419\n00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:54.330\nPerfect, so\nI have three open workbooks right now.\n\n420\n00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:58.120\nHow do I get back to the Christmas Cats?\n\n421\n00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.060\nThere's a couple ways.\n\n422\n00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:04.800\nIn the Excel program, you have a window\nmenu and down at the bottom of the Window\n\n423\n00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.620\nmenu, you have the different\noptions that you have open.\n\n424\n00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:14.320\nSo, if I wanted to switch back,\nI can click on Christmas Cats Example.\n\n425\n00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.530\nAnd that becomes the active workbook.\n\n426\n00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:19.296\nI know because of my\ntitle bars up at the top.\n\n427\n00:23:19.296 --> 00:23:23.380\nSo, I wanna switch over to that Book1,\nthen I can switch over to Book1.\n\n428\n00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:26.030\nTotally fine, doing that way.\n\n429\n00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:29.720\nAnother way that I like is I\nlove my keyboard shortcuts.\n\n430\n00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.420\nThe command key and then the tilde key.\n\n431\n00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:34.490\nThat's the one above the tab key.\n\n432\n00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:39.342\nThat is a common shortcut within your\nMac OS to where it's cycling between open\n\n433\n00:23:39.342 --> 00:23:42.146\ndocuments or files within the application.\n\n434\n00:23:42.146 --> 00:23:46.935\nSo you can see as I am clicking, there's\nthe Christmas Cats, there's the navigate,\n\n435\n00:23:46.935 --> 00:23:50.412\nthere's the Book1, so\nI can switch back and forth by using and\n\n436\n00:23:50.412 --> 00:23:54.304\njust cycling through by holding\nCommand and clicking that tilde key.\n\n437\n00:23:54.304 --> 00:23:57.393\nLove that one, use it all the time.\n\n438\n00:23:57.393 --> 00:24:01.853\nDifferent than command tab by the way,\ncommand tab is switching between\n\n439\n00:24:01.853 --> 00:24:04.790\napplications, so\nbe careful about those two.\n\n440\n00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:07.340\nThe other way is, you can do it manually.\n\n441\n00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:10.180\nYou could take this and\nmove this one around by, remember,\n\n442\n00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:15.630\ngrabbing the title bar, changing\nthe size of this particular workbook,\n\n443\n00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:19.190\nclicking once on this ghosted\none that becomes the active,\n\n444\n00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:23.990\nget the two pointed arrows,\nmove this down, move this around so\n\n445\n00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:27.110\nyou can be as manual as you want.\n\n446\n00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:28.970\nOops, see now when I grab this it kind of,\n\n447\n00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:34.760\nI can't really get to that title bar\nvery well, so I can move them around and\n\n448\n00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:39.260\nadjust as needed and\nsee them more on a tiled view.\n\n449\n00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:42.360\nThere is another option\nhere in the window menu of\n\n450\n00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:45.700\nthe Excel program that\nyou can go into arrange.\n\n451\n00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:50.144\nAnd when you say, I want to arrange\nall of my active windows as tiled, or\n\n452\n00:24:50.144 --> 00:24:54.515\nhorizontal or vertical, you click OK,\nand then it just goes ahead and\n\n453\n00:24:54.515 --> 00:24:56.461\nputs them in their quadrants.\n\n454\n00:24:56.461 --> 00:24:59.626\nI have different zoom levels on this,\nso that's why it might be like,\n\n455\n00:24:59.626 --> 00:25:01.030\nI don't really see anything.\n\n456\n00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:04.650\nYou'd have to manipulate,\nthen workbooks and\n\n457\n00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:08.970\nzoom levels in each file, but\nwe'll get to that in another episode.\n\n458\n00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:10.660\nSo just different ways that\nwe can move things around.\n\n459\n00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:11.950\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonn, do these\n\n460\n00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:14.930\nbehaviors change based on what\nis the current active document?\n\n461\n00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:20.220\nSo tiled here, we see one,\ntwo, and then one in this,\n\n462\n00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:22.900\nspanning essentially two quadrants-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n463\n00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.180\n&gt;&gt; Of the screen.\n\n464\n00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:27.340\nWas that because that was the active\ndocument at the time of tiling?\n\n465\n00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:27.880\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n\n466\n00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:28.670\nYou know what?\n\n467\n00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:29.940\nLet's try this.\n\n468\n00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:33.790\nSo okay, here, navigating\nthe workbook is the active document.\n\n469\n00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:40.585\nIf I go over to arrange and go with tiled,\nyeah, it looks like it, good eyes.\n\n470\n00:25:40.585 --> 00:25:44.915\n[LAUGH] It just puts it\nin these little places.\n\n471\n00:25:44.915 --> 00:25:48.501\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now we're looking at tile,\n\n472\n00:25:48.501 --> 00:25:51.459\nthere's a few other arrangements,\nhorizontal, vertical, cascade,\n\n473\n00:25:51.459 --> 00:25:52.760\nI'm not even sure why cascade.\n\n474\n00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:54.770\nAll that does is stack them in this\n\n475\n00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:55.480\ntabbed-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n476\n00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.410\n&gt;&gt; Manner, so\n\n477\n00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:58.920\nyou can see just the edges of each one.\n\n478\n00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.680\nBut for tiled,\n\n479\n00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:04.030\nif I have four documents open,\nwould I then get four quadrants instead of\n\n480\n00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:07.430\na columner of the active document?\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n481\n00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:11.100\nit'll take however many you have and\nthen just put them however it arranges it.\n\n482\n00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:14.800\nI don't know what it does past four\nof where it maybe puts two and\n\n483\n00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.760\nthree.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think past four,\n\n484\n00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:20.740\nthen you've got a lot of Excel going on.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\n\n485\n00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:23.760\n&gt;&gt; So maybe it's best to have full screens\n\n486\n00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.070\nand then use that keyboard\nshortcut command tilde-\n\n487\n00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:28.550\n&gt;&gt; To navigate as appropriate.\n\n488\n00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:30.278\nSo these are nice if you need to do\n\n489\n00:26:30.278 --> 00:26:32.546\nquick comparisons left to right-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n490\n00:26:32.546 --> 00:26:34.287\n&gt;&gt; But it can get a little crowded\n\n491\n00:26:34.287 --> 00:26:38.328\nfrom time to time, especially zoom\nlevels are if you need to see large\n\n492\n00:26:38.328 --> 00:26:41.190\nswaths of information\nwithin your workbook.\n\n493\n00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:44.080\nSo you gotta pick the tool\nthat's necessary to get the job\n\n494\n00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.550\ndone that you're currently doing.\n&gt;&gt; I like the way you're thinking.\n\n495\n00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:47.410\nYes exactly.\n\n496\n00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:50.520\nYou gotta figure it out, so\nyou gotta figure it out on your own.\n\n497\n00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:53.980\nNo, we're trying to give you the different\npointers on how you can best work and\n\n498\n00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:55.140\nit takes a while.\n\n499\n00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:58.620\nAnd I know I've changed my work flow\nhere and there throughout the years and\n\n500\n00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:01.150\nit's just whatever works for you.\n\n501\n00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:06.290\nSo now, if I'm wanting to close some of\nthese down I can click the little red X at\n\n502\n00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:12.090\nthe top, cuz I haven't done these changes\nor anything like that, so I would like to\n\n503\n00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:17.780\nquickly go over save versus save as,\nbecause while it seems very basic,\n\n504\n00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:22.400\nit is one of those things that,\nit trips people up from time to time.\n\n505\n00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:26.820\nNow, I do have Excel still open,\nso let's start a new document.\n\n506\n00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:29.840\nAnd, all right, save versus save as,\n\n507\n00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:33.680\nhow do you explain it Justin?\n&gt;&gt; Well I tell you this is a tricky topic,\n\n508\n00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:34.420\nso all right.\n\n509\n00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:37.910\nSo I have a brand new document open,\nand I click save.\n\n510\n00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:42.440\nWell, that's gonna ask me for a file\nname and a location, because I've never\n\n511\n00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.920\nsaved it before in my life.\n&gt;&gt; Just like this.\n\n512\n00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:45.430\n&gt;&gt; Just like\n\n513\n00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:46.720\nthat.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n514\n00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.980\n&gt;&gt; If I were to do save as,\n\n515\n00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:52.025\nI would get a very similar experience\nbecause this is a new document.\n\n516\n00:27:52.025 --> 00:27:53.450\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.\n\n517\n00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:55.700\n&gt;&gt; If I have an existing document that I\n\n518\n00:27:55.700 --> 00:28:01.648\nhave made changes to,\nthen when I click save, save in place,\n\n519\n00:28:01.648 --> 00:28:06.040\nthe document already has a name and\na location, so just save the changes.\n\n520\n00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:11.310\nBut if I save as, I'm gonna create\neffectively a copy that is saving\n\n521\n00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:14.450\nthose changes to a different document\nthat should have a different location,\n\n522\n00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:17.320\nmaybe the same folder and a file name.\n\n523\n00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.640\nSo effectively that's your location.\n\n524\n00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.500\nThere's a lot of nuanced behavior there-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n525\n00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:22.800\n&gt;&gt; That can really trip you up.\n\n526\n00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.650\nCuz I'm not saying I have, but\n\n527\n00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:27.610\nI might have accidentally saved over\nthings before that I didn't mean to,\n\n528\n00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:29.390\nthat I meant to use Save As.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n529\n00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:32.514\n&gt;&gt; And then there was lots of tears and\n\n530\n00:28:32.514 --> 00:28:35.716\npanic.\n&gt;&gt; I feel like you've been a thing over\n\n531\n00:28:35.716 --> 00:28:40.676\nmy shoulder throughout my life because\nI've had so many of those moment where\n\n532\n00:28:40.676 --> 00:28:45.501\nit's yes, I've ended up in tears of\nlike I can't believe I just did that.\n\n533\n00:28:45.501 --> 00:28:47.550\n[LAUGH] It's not fun.\n\n534\n00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:52.030\nLike for right here I typed in,\nhi Justin, in my Christmas Cats example.\n\n535\n00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:54.580\nIf I save the changes right now,\nthen guess what,\n\n536\n00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:59.160\nyou all will be getting a file that says\nhi Justin in the Christmas cat's example.\n\n537\n00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:03.920\nSo I don't want to save the changes to\nthis particular file with this name and\n\n538\n00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:04.490\nthis home.\n\n539\n00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:06.650\nThat's how I kind of say it.\n\n540\n00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:11.290\nIf I save as, it gives me the option to\n\n541\n00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:16.110\neither change the name and/or\nthe home of where it lives.\n\n542\n00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:19.880\nI could put the same name,\nput it in my My Documents and\n\n543\n00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:23.640\nit's two different files,\ncuz they're in two different locations.\n\n544\n00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.820\nSo keep that in mind too.\n\n545\n00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:31.780\nSo if I say Christmas Cats Justin,\nput it on my desktop, now,\n\n546\n00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:36.210\nthis is the new file or the saved over,\na lot of people call those templates,\n\n547\n00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:38.650\nI have a template that I start with and\nthen do a save.\n\n548\n00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:41.520\nIt's technically not a template,\nbut it's a starting point.\n\n549\n00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:47.460\nSo now if I said, Hello,\nI want to save the changes to this file,\n\n550\n00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:55.110\nthen I would do file Save, update\nthe changes to that particular file.\n\n551\n00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:57.540\nSo be careful of it, we have all done it.\n\n552\n00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:01.832\nWe have all saved over the wrong file or\nsaved change and\n\n553\n00:30:01.832 --> 00:30:05.935\nthen didn't have my backup or\na copy, and it [SOUND],\n\n554\n00:30:05.935 --> 00:30:08.812\nit can hurt your soul [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Now, Vonne,\n\n555\n00:30:08.812 --> 00:30:10.510\nquick follow up question about this and\n\n556\n00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:14.370\nI know the different applications that I\nuse have a little bit different behaviors.\n\n557\n00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:17.090\nLet's say I do a save as, but\nI do not change the name, and\n\n558\n00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:18.330\nI do not change the location.\n\n559\n00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:21.471\nDoes it warn me that it's gonna\noverwrite or does it just go, cool?\n\n560\n00:30:21.471 --> 00:30:23.900\nDoes it default back to\na save like behavior?\n\n561\n00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:24.797\n&gt;&gt; Let's try it,\n\n562\n00:30:24.797 --> 00:30:29.160\nif I said let's just save it, and\nit just says yeah, it already exists.\n\n563\n00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.540\nDo you want to replace it?\n\n564\n00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:33.780\nAnd there's times like, yes, I do,\nI want you to override the changes.\n\n565\n00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:39.110\nBut again, in a sense, you didn't do\nanything different but it does give you,\n\n566\n00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:43.230\nit does boss at you a little bit and say,\nhey, are you sure you wanna do that?\n\n567\n00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:45.610\nAnd then, yes, I did want to do that.\n\n568\n00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:48.730\nSo good point,\ncuz I have had those warnings and\n\n569\n00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:51.850\nit can be a little scary\nwhen it's yelling at you.\n\n570\n00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:53.980\nSo good, all right, awesome.\n\n571\n00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:58.650\nSo different options to get us started,\nsome pretty basics,\n\n572\n00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:00.340\nbut all the things that\nyou need to know about.\n\n573\n00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:02.250\nI'm gonna close out of your file, Justin.\n\n574\n00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:07.290\nSo I'm gonna do a shortcut, I'm gonna\nend on a shortcut and do Command W,\n\n575\n00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:12.480\njust to let you know File, Close,\nnotice to the right hand side\n\n576\n00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:17.220\nyou have what looks like a swirly thing,\nthat's the Command E and the W key,\n\n577\n00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:22.320\nagain you do not have to be doing\nshortcuts as I go through it.\n\n578\n00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:24.540\nI love them, I have lists of them or\n\n579\n00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:28.760\nreferences to them in the show\nnotes if you wanted to find them.\n\n580\n00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:31.900\nSo good to know, get you familiar.\n\n581\n00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.050\nI had another file, okay,\nwe'll do a Command W.\n\n582\n00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:36.580\nI do not wanna save the changes to this,\n\n583\n00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:42.270\nbecause I don't need to save the hello to\nbook2, so I can click the do not save and\n\n584\n00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:46.350\nthen we're going to go ahead and\nwrap that one up really.\n\n585\n00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:51.030\nJust getting you started, hope that\nexplained some things about working with\n\n586\n00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:55.140\nyour Windows but after this, we're going\nto talk about getting into the interface\n\n587\n00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:58.170\na little bit more and identifying things\nlike the quick access toolbar, and\n\n588\n00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:00.670\nthe status bar, and the formula bars,\n\n589\n00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:04.560\nand all the bars within Excel.\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's a whole lot of\n\n590\n00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:07.780\nbars that I'm looking forward to and\nhopefully you are as well.\n\n591\n00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:10.390\nSome wonderful tidbits that we\ncan take away and, hopefully,\n\n592\n00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:11.805\nmake our lives a little more productive.\n\n593\n00:32:11.805 --> 00:32:15.140\nWe've set an even foundation and,\nwell, hopefully,\n\n594\n00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:17.630\nyou'll join us back as we\ncontinue building upon it.\n\n595\n00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:19.260\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n596\n00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:22.150\nSo signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n597\n00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:22.976\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonn Smith.\n\n598\n00:32:22.976 --> 00:32:23.905\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n599\n00:32:23.905 --> 00:32:28.920\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.185\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and we're\nback with more Excel 2016 Essentials for\n\n4\n00:00:20.185 --> 00:00:23.332\nMac and where we're gonna be looking\nat the Excel interface today.\n\n5\n00:00:23.332 --> 00:00:27.580\nAnd luckily, we have someone to\nshow us the way, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n6\n00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.237\nHow you doing today Vonne?\n\n7\n00:00:28.237 --> 00:00:29.670\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.938\nI'm ready to show you all all about Excel.\n\n9\n00:00:32.938 --> 00:00:35.410\n&gt;&gt; Well, that sounds like a happy go time.\n\n10\n00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.100\nI'm ready to get started.\n\n11\n00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.638\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we're gonna talk\nabout the environment, interface.\n\n12\n00:00:40.638 --> 00:00:43.358\nYou're what are you looking\nat on the screen and\n\n13\n00:00:43.358 --> 00:00:47.982\nwe're gonna identify these pieces and\ngive them their proper names, so you know\n\n14\n00:00:47.982 --> 00:00:52.900\nwhat they are when maybe you're reading\nsome tutorials or different things online.\n\n15\n00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.554\nOr maybe your text support is telling you,\nyeah, go ahead and\n\n16\n00:00:55.554 --> 00:00:57.149\ngo up into the quick access tool bar.\n\n17\n00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.347\nClick the drop-down and click customize.\n\n18\n00:00:58.347 --> 00:01:00.935\nAnd you're like I'm sorry, what?\n\n19\n00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:02.119\n[LAUGH] Quick access who?\n\n20\n00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:05.868\nSo things that you need to know about and\nthen you can make up their own names,\n\n21\n00:01:05.868 --> 00:01:07.810\ncuz I always give them their own names.\n\n22\n00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.178\nBut you need the technical ones too.\n\n23\n00:01:09.178 --> 00:01:12.278\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne, I will say,\nthis is sometimes people are like, no, no,\n\n24\n00:01:12.278 --> 00:01:13.520\nI got you, I got you.\n\n25\n00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.569\nBut an interface in a more\ngeneral sense is the method or\n\n26\n00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:22.244\nthe thing that you interact or\nmaybe a proxy to an interaction.\n\n27\n00:01:22.244 --> 00:01:23.825\nYou actually use interfaces every day.\n\n28\n00:01:23.825 --> 00:01:26.278\nIf you've walked through\na door today at any point,\n\n29\n00:01:26.278 --> 00:01:29.026\nyou have used a commonly\ndefined interface, a door knob.\n\n30\n00:01:29.026 --> 00:01:33.311\nIf you've ever walked up to a door that\nit's ambiguous about whether it's push or\n\n31\n00:01:33.311 --> 00:01:35.371\na pull door, that's a bad interface.\n\n32\n00:01:35.371 --> 00:01:39.903\nBut knowing well, that will actually help\nyou navigate around through your hallways.\n\n33\n00:01:39.903 --> 00:01:44.111\nSo definitely pay attention, it's gonna\nalleviate a lot of frustration as you're\n\n34\n00:01:44.111 --> 00:01:46.315\ntrying to use your tooling appropriately.\n\n35\n00:01:46.315 --> 00:01:48.342\n&gt;&gt; I'm over here laughing at myself,\n\n36\n00:01:48.342 --> 00:01:52.666\n[LAUGH] because I've gone into like a\nbusiness and I do that and the people like\n\n37\n00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:57.740\nbehind the counter just laughing at me and\nI'm just like wait which way am I going?\n\n38\n00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.758\nYes and I think it's on them.\n\n39\n00:01:59.758 --> 00:02:03.143\nYeah, they didn't clearly define\nwhether it was a push or pull.\n\n40\n00:02:03.143 --> 00:02:05.211\nSo [LAUGH] but I'm gonna clear and\nfind some things for you.\n\n41\n00:02:05.211 --> 00:02:08.040\nSo why don't we jump down into\nthis computer and get started.\n\n42\n00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.991\nI don't have any files opened up,\nso I'm gonna go the find your way.\n\n43\n00:02:11.991 --> 00:02:17.611\nI'm gonna go into my particular folder and\nthen open up the file from here.\n\n44\n00:02:17.611 --> 00:02:20.140\nPut it in the list view.\n\n45\n00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.416\nLet's just go back to that Christmas Cats,\ncuz I just like to see them.\n\n46\n00:02:23.416 --> 00:02:26.546\nI'm going to do something\nkinda quick before we start.\n\n47\n00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:27.592\nI'm just hitting a zoom key.\n\n48\n00:02:27.592 --> 00:02:29.071\nDon't worry about where\nI'm clicking right now.\n\n49\n00:02:29.071 --> 00:02:32.820\nJust we'll cover that later,\nyou're all good.\n\n50\n00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.448\nJust gonna see a little bit\nmore on the screen at one time.\n\n51\n00:02:36.448 --> 00:02:37.906\nSo where are we gonna start?\n\n52\n00:02:37.906 --> 00:02:39.544\nWe've already talked about the title bar.\n\n53\n00:02:39.544 --> 00:02:41.624\nWe talked about that on the Excel basics.\n\n54\n00:02:41.624 --> 00:02:47.290\nIt's right across the top and\nthe thing is the title bar almost looks\n\n55\n00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.759\nlike it's all one piece of like\nthis whole green area up here, but\n\n56\n00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:58.552\nit's really comprised of multiple\npieces within our environment.\n\n57\n00:02:58.552 --> 00:03:02.066\nAnd so that it kinda gets\nlost in the shuffle, but\n\n58\n00:03:02.066 --> 00:03:04.975\nit's really where your name is.\n\n59\n00:03:04.975 --> 00:03:07.997\nThe name of the file is\nwhere the title bar goes and\n\n60\n00:03:07.997 --> 00:03:12.127\nthere's something that I actually\nforgot to show you all in it, so\n\n61\n00:03:12.127 --> 00:03:16.363\nbasically that I said I would I just\nreminded myself of this button.\n\n62\n00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:19.235\nWe talked about over on\nthe like our Window commands.\n\n63\n00:03:19.235 --> 00:03:21.105\nWe have our full screen button,\n\n64\n00:03:21.105 --> 00:03:25.488\nbut what it used to do is do this whole\nlike zoom like a kinda fill the screen.\n\n65\n00:03:25.488 --> 00:03:29.741\nLet me show you what I mean and I'm\ngonna just size this down a little bit.\n\n66\n00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:32.332\nI don't need this anymore, so\nI'm just gonna close that up.\n\n67\n00:03:32.332 --> 00:03:33.031\nSo I'm gonna grab this here.\n\n68\n00:03:33.031 --> 00:03:36.437\nIf I double-click right on the title bar,\n\n69\n00:03:36.437 --> 00:03:41.080\nyou see how it just kinda fills\nthe whole area of my screen.\n\n70\n00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.664\nBut does not take me into full\nscreen mode and I like that.\n\n71\n00:03:45.664 --> 00:03:49.931\nI think in Windows,\nit actually minimizes your files.\n\n72\n00:03:49.931 --> 00:03:51.507\nActually, I don't remember,\nbut that's okay.\n\n73\n00:03:51.507 --> 00:03:53.414\nIt's not a Windows show,\nso it doesn't matter.\n\n74\n00:03:53.414 --> 00:03:57.639\nThis is a system preference thing that I\nhave on my Mac, so just double-check that.\n\n75\n00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:01.665\nBut just wanted to come back around,\nbecause I just remembered.\n\n76\n00:04:01.665 --> 00:04:05.916\nSo now that I've got that maximized for\nlack of better terms,\n\n77\n00:04:05.916 --> 00:04:08.304\nwe know that this is our title bar.\n\n78\n00:04:08.304 --> 00:04:13.125\nBut I did go over to the left and\nI went to my Windows control,\n\n79\n00:04:13.125 --> 00:04:17.283\nbut I glazed over this whole\nsection right up here.\n\n80\n00:04:17.283 --> 00:04:21.629\nThis little area,\nit's not roped off or fenced off.\n\n81\n00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:24.306\nThis is the quick access toolbar.\n\n82\n00:04:24.306 --> 00:04:28.140\nSo that's what this thing is across\nthe top and then you have your\n\n83\n00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.546\nWindows control, but I'll come back\naround to that in just a little bit.\n\n84\n00:04:32.546 --> 00:04:36.864\nI should probably stay on my note so\nI don't get too far off track, but\n\n85\n00:04:36.864 --> 00:04:40.180\nit all kinda looks like the title bar.\n\n86\n00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.542\nBut above all that,\nwe do have our menu bars.\n\n87\n00:04:42.542 --> 00:04:46.370\nI love the menus in case if I\nwanted to go to the file menu,\n\n88\n00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.250\nyou still have a file menu.\n\n89\n00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.683\nI think it was Office 2007 that they got\nrid of the menus and went to the full\n\n90\n00:04:53.683 --> 00:04:59.555\nribbon interface and everybody's world\nwas turned upside down, mine included.\n\n91\n00:04:59.555 --> 00:05:03.964\nSo it's nice that Mac decided\nto keep it old school.\n\n92\n00:05:03.964 --> 00:05:05.600\nKeep our mittens there.\n\n93\n00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.994\nI like this one though.\n\n94\n00:05:06.994 --> 00:05:10.644\nSo if I needed to go to the view or the\nadd or the insert, you can see all those.\n\n95\n00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:15.575\nBut well, most of our menu commands,\nI would say,\n\n96\n00:05:15.575 --> 00:05:19.716\nyeah, I'll say, most are on the ribbon.\n\n97\n00:05:19.716 --> 00:05:24.018\nThe ribbon is this whole area right here.\n\n98\n00:05:24.018 --> 00:05:27.097\nI know it might be kinda\nhard to see my mouse.\n\n99\n00:05:27.097 --> 00:05:32.298\nBut it's all these things across\nthe top where it says, Home,\n\n100\n00:05:32.298 --> 00:05:37.318\nInsert, Page Layout, Formulas,\nData, Review and View.\n\n101\n00:05:37.318 --> 00:05:40.429\nThose are tabs on the ribbon.\n\n102\n00:05:40.429 --> 00:05:42.554\nSo this whole area right in here and\n\n103\n00:05:42.554 --> 00:05:45.350\nthat's where you have\nall of your commands.\n\n104\n00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:50.630\nThey used to be toolbars back in the day,\nnow it's all in these ribbon commands.\n\n105\n00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.161\nBut these ribbons and these tabs,\nif you single-click, don't double.\n\n106\n00:05:55.161 --> 00:05:59.901\nSingle click the formulas tab,\nnotice it goes ahead and brings up all of\n\n107\n00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:04.802\nthe formulas or the different buttons,\nI should say on the formulas tab.\n\n108\n00:06:04.802 --> 00:06:06.390\nYou click on review.\n\n109\n00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:11.225\nThings like spellcheck and\nyour comments, and your accessibility.\n\n110\n00:06:11.225 --> 00:06:14.332\nInsert menu and you wanna go ahead\na pick out your, or put in a picture or\n\n111\n00:06:14.332 --> 00:06:15.186\nthings like that.\n\n112\n00:06:15.186 --> 00:06:20.061\nThose are your different commands that you\nwill find on the tabs of your ribbon and\n\n113\n00:06:20.061 --> 00:06:21.780\nthat's what you got.\n\n114\n00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.324\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne, you told me not\nto double-click on something and\n\n115\n00:06:25.324 --> 00:06:28.174\nI feel strongly compelled\nto just immediately go\n\n116\n00:06:28.174 --> 00:06:31.873\nopen up Excel on my computer and\nstart double clicking things.\n\n117\n00:06:31.873 --> 00:06:34.059\nWhat happens if I double-click\non those ribbon tabs?\n\n118\n00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:38.567\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, double-clicking is going to\nautomatically collapse the ribbon.\n\n119\n00:06:38.567 --> 00:06:39.714\nThrow those people off,\n\n120\n00:06:39.714 --> 00:06:42.667\nbecause we're kinda used to\ndouble-clicking on everything.\n\n121\n00:06:42.667 --> 00:06:45.620\nDouble-clicking, watch,\nif I go ahead like that.\n\n122\n00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.668\nYou see how it [SOUND] and\nit sucks itself up.\n\n123\n00:06:47.668 --> 00:06:51.500\nAnd if you're not expecting that you're\nlike, I don't know where everything went.\n\n124\n00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:53.949\nSo you collapsed the ribbon.\n\n125\n00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:58.107\nBut if you single-click again,\nit's gonna bring them back.\n\n126\n00:06:58.107 --> 00:06:59.850\nAnd now, they're fully expanded.\n\n127\n00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:04.989\nSo it's not like a B on and all,\nbut it does collapse them down.\n\n128\n00:07:04.989 --> 00:07:08.217\nAnd over here on to the right-hand side,\nthe say, it's tiny.\n\n129\n00:07:08.217 --> 00:07:11.490\nThere is like this little carat\nlittle button right there.\n\n130\n00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.437\nIf you click on, and I got my tool tip.\n\n131\n00:07:13.437 --> 00:07:15.985\nSo it's nice to hover to discover,\nlove that.\n\n132\n00:07:15.985 --> 00:07:20.774\nSo if I click it, do you see how now\nI can collapse and expand the ribbon?\n\n133\n00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:23.442\nIt's over there on the side, but\n\n134\n00:07:23.442 --> 00:07:27.934\ndouble-clicking the tabs is\na short cut to doing that.\n\n135\n00:07:27.934 --> 00:07:31.301\nSo just be aware not the end of the world,\nbut\n\n136\n00:07:31.301 --> 00:07:36.230\nat least you know that they are there and\nthat's nice.\n\n137\n00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.349\nIf I click on the home button and\nnotice on the home button,\n\n138\n00:07:38.349 --> 00:07:40.262\nI'm gonna zoom in a little bit so\nyou could see this.\n\n139\n00:07:40.262 --> 00:07:44.586\nYou see there are some\nslight divider lines\n\n140\n00:07:44.586 --> 00:07:49.640\nbetween these areas,\nbecause these are groups.\n\n141\n00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:55.171\nI think it's the font group and I think\nthis is the, I don't remember group.\n\n142\n00:07:55.171 --> 00:07:57.601\n[LAUGH] Alignment group.\n\n143\n00:07:57.601 --> 00:08:01.091\nWell, I know they have names and\nI know that they are a groups, but\n\n144\n00:08:01.091 --> 00:08:02.755\nthey're not showing me them.\n\n145\n00:08:02.755 --> 00:08:03.407\nWhy?\n\n146\n00:08:03.407 --> 00:08:06.499\nBecause for some reason,\nin our Mac products,\n\n147\n00:08:06.499 --> 00:08:10.330\nthey don't show the group\nnames by default.\n\n148\n00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.430\nOkay, that's fine but\nyou can get bring them back.\n\n149\n00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:16.790\nAnd that might be good especially if you\nwere reading tutorials like go to the home\n\n150\n00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:22.860\ntab, go to the alignment group,\nand click the whatever button.\n\n151\n00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:30.548\nSomething to keep in mind, this is part of\nyour preferences of your program of Excel.\n\n152\n00:08:30.548 --> 00:08:36.792\nSo to get there, you get to the Excel\nmenu, and you go to Preferences.\n\n153\n00:08:36.792 --> 00:08:40.454\nJust a little side note,\nif you're coming from a PC world,\n\n154\n00:08:40.454 --> 00:08:44.560\nthe preferences and pretty much all\nof your office products are not\n\n155\n00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.290\nnearly as extensive as\nthey are in your Mac.\n\n156\n00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:50.590\nMac, it's just a name in the game.\n\n157\n00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:54.860\nI'm going to probably keep on saying that\nyou might like stop comparing it to PC.\n\n158\n00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:58.600\nBut because I'm so\nbilingual in these products, and\n\n159\n00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.940\nmaybe you're coming from that, and just so\nwhen you might have somebody else in your\n\n160\n00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:05.750\noffice that is saying, well,\nyeah do this, and like, I can't do that.\n\n161\n00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:08.190\nWhy?\nI'm on Excel for Mac.\n\n162\n00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.660\nThere are some significant differences.\n\n163\n00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.170\nWell, I guess significant is maybe\n\n164\n00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:17.830\na relative term like how much it means to\nyou, but there are some big differences.\n\n165\n00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:21.080\nAnd on the ribbon and tool button,\nnope that's the wrong one.\n\n166\n00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.010\nLet me go back to here, it's on the View.\n\n167\n00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:26.050\nAnd there, there it is.\n\n168\n00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:28.810\nMy [LAUGH] I'll find it eventually,\nthere's not that many.\n\n169\n00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:33.260\nAt bottom, it says In Ribbon,\nShow the Group Titles.\n\n170\n00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:39.540\nSo if I click on the Group Titles,\nnotice if I close this, now I can see.\n\n171\n00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.390\nYeah, it was, it was Alignment, okay.\n\n172\n00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:42.950\nSo I've got the little line, or\n\n173\n00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:48.650\nthe little names of the groups\nunder them on my ribbon.\n\n174\n00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:51.840\nGood to know, I like that.\n\n175\n00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.090\nNow, something else to know\nabout your ribbon, and\n\n176\n00:09:55.090 --> 00:10:00.160\nhow much I can see versus maybe\nyou can see on your computer.\n\n177\n00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.070\nIt is dynamic.\n\n178\n00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:07.150\nThey change depending on\nthe resolution of your monitor.\n\n179\n00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:12.470\nYou get those big wide monitors you might\nbe seeing a lot more than I can see.\n\n180\n00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:17.330\nI'm gonna take this and size it down and\nwatch these buttons like right over here.\n\n181\n00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:21.620\nAs soon as I start, see how they\nstart kind of collapsing down into\n\n182\n00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:25.040\ndrop down menus they don't\nhave like the big icon?\n\n183\n00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:29.280\nSo if I change this down, notice that\nthey all kind of come in to like,\n\n184\n00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:34.020\nthere is like a drop down out for all the\nfont options and there is a drop down for\n\n185\n00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.460\nall of the alignment.\n\n186\n00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:39.980\nSo that can trip you off and I know\nswitching back from computers I'm like,\n\n187\n00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:44.110\nI'm so used to looking at a specific icon,\nI can't find it cuz,\n\n188\n00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:47.230\nit's grouped in here now\nbecause my resolution is lower.\n\n189\n00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:51.270\nSo different things to know\nabout with the ribbon and\n\n190\n00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:52.820\nhow it can change what we're looking at.\n\n191\n00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:57.330\n&gt;&gt; Now, Vaughn along those lines,\nI have actually seen tabs that\n\n192\n00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.970\naren't on yours but I've seen on mine.\n\n193\n00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:04.820\nAre all the tabs in the ribbon that we\nsee the only tabs we will ever see or\n\n194\n00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:05.980\nare there different ones?\n\n195\n00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:07.060\n&gt;&gt; There are some.\n\n196\n00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.120\nThere's a developer tab.\n\n197\n00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:15.100\nThat one is hidden by default because you\nget into developer land like macros and\n\n198\n00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.480\nthings like that.\n\n199\n00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:21.402\nAnd it could also be depending\non other products that you\n\n200\n00:11:21.402 --> 00:11:24.658\nhave that might have an Excel add in.\n\n201\n00:11:24.658 --> 00:11:30.229\nMaybe there's a Acrobat tab cuz maybe you\nhave Acrobat installed that goes ahead and\n\n202\n00:11:30.229 --> 00:11:31.338\nties in with it.\n\n203\n00:11:31.338 --> 00:11:35.517\nOr maybe there is a specific program that\nworks with Excel and you can have it and\n\n204\n00:11:35.517 --> 00:11:37.230\nhave specific commands.\n\n205\n00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:41.190\nSo that is something that might\nbe very unique to you and\n\n206\n00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:43.080\nwhat you have on your computer.\n\n207\n00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:47.710\nBut back in the Excel\npreferences there was here,\n\n208\n00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:50.930\nnotice that right here\nthere's that developer tab.\n\n209\n00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:52.640\nIt's not turned on.\n\n210\n00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.200\nSo that's where you can turn on or\noff what tab,\n\n211\n00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.950\nI probably would not turn off any of\nthese, you need all of them, okay?\n\n212\n00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:05.590\nThat's why we have those options for\nwhat you're seeing across the top.\n\n213\n00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:08.490\nYou will also see what's\nknown as contextual tabs.\n\n214\n00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:10.520\nHmm, big fancy word.\n\n215\n00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:11.220\nAnd then you know what?\n\n216\n00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.370\nThat ties into what you might be saying.\n\n217\n00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:17.500\nI've seen where the ones up\nthere that maybe pop in here and\n\n218\n00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.100\npop out there,\ndepending on what you clicked on.\n\n219\n00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.720\nFor example,\nthere's this little right over here.\n\n220\n00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:27.210\nWhen I click on that, this is a graphic.\n\n221\n00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:30.470\nAnd as soon as I click on it,\nit brings up the picture format tab.\n\n222\n00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:32.147\nWas that also maybe what\nyou were alluding to?\n\n223\n00:12:32.147 --> 00:12:35.967\n&gt;&gt; I think this is probably more because\nI'm definitely not turned on anything\n\n224\n00:12:35.967 --> 00:12:39.022\nbecause I've never opened\npreferences in Excel in my life.\n\n225\n00:12:39.022 --> 00:12:43.130\nSo It's probably this one.\n\n226\n00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:44.920\nAnd these kind of pop in and out.\n\n227\n00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:49.350\nThey seem random, but they're always\nbased on some kind of action or\n\n228\n00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:50.630\nselection that you've made, right?\n\n229\n00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:52.320\n&gt;&gt; Selection is the key word right there.\n\n230\n00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.050\nIf something that you have selected on,\nif I come over here to the chart,\n\n231\n00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:57.920\nnotice that it's gonna\nbring up the chart tools.\n\n232\n00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.400\nIf I click off of this,\nit's not going to have the chart tools,\n\n233\n00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.220\ncuz I'm not actively on\nthat particular thing.\n\n234\n00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:07.790\nIf I come over here to the addresses,\nthis is format as a table, so\n\n235\n00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:12.260\nnow I get a table tab that\nwould have specific items or\n\n236\n00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:17.260\noptions for using tables but as soon\nas I click off it, it will go away.\n\n237\n00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:21.180\nSo yeah,\nit does matter on what you have selected.\n\n238\n00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:24.110\nAnd by the way,\nwe will go over how to navigate a workbook\n\n239\n00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:27.680\nin another episode if you're like, what\nare you doing, tell me what's going on?\n\n240\n00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.340\nWe'll get there.\n&gt;&gt; I'm glad\n\n241\n00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.336\nyou brought that up cuz I was gonna do,\nhold up Vonne.\n\n242\n00:13:30.336 --> 00:13:33.330\n[LAUGH] You got multiple things going on\nin there I didn't even see that coming,\n\n243\n00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.139\nit was like a curve ball hanging outside.\n\n244\n00:13:35.139 --> 00:13:36.670\nI swung to the fences and it was a miss.\n\n245\n00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:40.370\nSo there's other things in this\nworkbook other than this one,\n\n246\n00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:41.390\nother than what we're saying.\n\n247\n00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:45.050\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and right now we're really\nconcentrating on the interface.\n\n248\n00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:49.170\nAnd so that we were demonstrating\nthe contextual tabs\n\n249\n00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:51.090\nbased on the different\nthings that I'm selecting.\n\n250\n00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:53.080\nSo good point.\n\n251\n00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.810\nSo let's move on to another area.\n\n252\n00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:57.550\nI had already pointed it out before and\n\n253\n00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:00.720\nthat is the quick access\ntoolbar right up here.\n\n254\n00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.100\nAnd I will zoom in so you can see.\n\n255\n00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.110\nThere is some little buttons.\n\n256\n00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:05.590\nThere is a little, what is that?\n\n257\n00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:06.360\nThat's a new file.\n\n258\n00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.160\nI'm like,\nI don't even know what that icon is.\n\n259\n00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.060\nIt's a file new,\nlike if I wanted to create.\n\n260\n00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:14.890\nI would just do Cmd+N personally,\nso I've never clicked this button.\n\n261\n00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:19.410\nRemember the old three and\na quarter diskettes?\n\n262\n00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:21.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they were near and\ndear to my heart, Vonne.\n\n263\n00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.547\nAnd by near and dear,\nI'm glad they're gone.\n\n264\n00:14:24.547 --> 00:14:27.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's the save icon, okay?\n\n265\n00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.060\nSo those are the different ways.\n\n266\n00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:33.860\nThere are ways that you can quickly\naccess commands that you would\n\n267\n00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:38.130\nnormally see other places like, this is\nyour best friend, this is the undo button.\n\n268\n00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:41.308\nThis is the redo or repeat.\n\n269\n00:14:41.308 --> 00:14:44.688\nIt says repeat close cuz that\nwas the last thing I did, maybe.\n\n270\n00:14:44.688 --> 00:14:47.380\nDon't worry about it, we'll get into\nit when we get into undo and redo.\n\n271\n00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:52.400\nBut if there's more things that I want to\ndo, maybe I want the little printer icon.\n\n272\n00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:56.040\nMaybe there's something that I'm\nalways doing like a big one for\n\n273\n00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:02.160\nme is I am always going into insert and\ndoing a screen shot.\n\n274\n00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:08.040\nSo that is a specific command I don't want\nto have to keep going to the insert tab,\n\n275\n00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:11.240\ngo over here to this little button and\nthen go to screen clipping.\n\n276\n00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.340\nSorry, they call it\na screen clipping here.\n\n277\n00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.847\nIt's a screen clipping in PC, too, sorry.\n\n278\n00:15:15.847 --> 00:15:19.320\nI could add that on to\nmy Quick Access toolbar.\n\n279\n00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.680\nSo that's kind of fun.\n\n280\n00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:21.541\nHow do I do that?\n\n281\n00:15:21.541 --> 00:15:26.239\nYou can come up to that drop down at\nthe very top, and when you click on it,\n\n282\n00:15:26.239 --> 00:15:30.497\nthere are some commonly used\nitems like Spell check, Printing.\n\n283\n00:15:30.497 --> 00:15:33.840\nBut if I want more, you click on More.\n\n284\n00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.280\nAnd it brings you back out to somewhere\nit looks like we were already before.\n\n285\n00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:42.030\nWe were just over on this little\nside on the ribbon, Quick Access.\n\n286\n00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:45.210\nYou find the command on\nthe left hand side and\n\n287\n00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:48.150\nyou add it to your Quick Access Toolbar.\n\n288\n00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:50.570\nBut you do need to be\ncareful about where is that?\n\n289\n00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:55.101\nThat screen clipping,\nI know it's in the Insert tab.\n\n290\n00:15:55.101 --> 00:15:56.681\nSo if I click on Insert,\n\n291\n00:15:56.681 --> 00:16:00.868\nthen it's gonna bring up the things\nthat are on the Insert Tab,\n\n292\n00:16:00.868 --> 00:16:05.300\nlike a slicer or a table or a text box or\nall those different things.\n\n293\n00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:09.230\nSo I can find it,\nmaybe I switched midstream.\n\n294\n00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:11.340\nI'm gonna say we're gonna do Insert Table,\nokay?\n\n295\n00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:14.732\nSo if I'm going to click on that,\nclick it over to the side, and\n\n296\n00:16:14.732 --> 00:16:17.305\nthen it adds it over to\nmy Quick Access Toolbar.\n\n297\n00:16:17.305 --> 00:16:19.298\nAnd you can load this thing up.\n\n298\n00:16:19.298 --> 00:16:24.334\nIt's kinda nice that we don't have\nto navigate through the ribbon.\n\n299\n00:16:24.334 --> 00:16:28.637\nAnd you can customize this until\nthe cows come home, and that's great.\n\n300\n00:16:28.637 --> 00:16:32.436\nA little side note, if you're looking for\nthe little check box that says\n\n301\n00:16:32.436 --> 00:16:36.689\nShow Below Ribbon, because that's what\nit does in PC land, it doesn't exist.\n\n302\n00:16:36.689 --> 00:16:38.860\nIt's always gonna stay at the top.\n\n303\n00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.270\nIt will not go below.\n\n304\n00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:43.275\nYou can't, sorry, I clicked Cancel.\n\n305\n00:16:43.275 --> 00:16:45.995\nAnd I don't need to apply\nthe changes to that one.\n\n306\n00:16:45.995 --> 00:16:48.943\nIt's just saying that, hey,\nyou don't want anything to happen, right?\n\n307\n00:16:48.943 --> 00:16:49.871\nAnd that's fine.\n\n308\n00:16:49.871 --> 00:16:52.138\nAnd notice it is back in my Preferences.\n\n309\n00:16:52.138 --> 00:16:54.441\nI went through the drop-down right here,\nbut\n\n310\n00:16:54.441 --> 00:16:57.583\nyou could totally go to your\nPreferences and do the same thing.\n\n311\n00:16:57.583 --> 00:17:01.197\nThe AutoSave, in case you're wondering,\nthat little guy right there.\n\n312\n00:17:01.197 --> 00:17:04.311\nAnd notice,\nthere's that hover to discover.\n\n313\n00:17:04.311 --> 00:17:07.085\nIf I move my mouse and\nnot move it for a little bit,\n\n314\n00:17:07.085 --> 00:17:10.606\nyou can see that it says it's only\nwhen you are saving this up to\n\n315\n00:17:10.606 --> 00:17:13.558\nyour OneDrive account or\nyour SharePoint Online.\n\n316\n00:17:13.558 --> 00:17:16.678\nThat' s what the AutoSave is for.\n\n317\n00:17:16.678 --> 00:17:23.770\nNot for locally stored files,\nit doesn't exist for that purpose.\n\n318\n00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:27.155\nSome other places that we need to get\nfamiliar with besides, we got the menus,\n\n319\n00:17:27.155 --> 00:17:29.210\nwe got the Quick Access,\nwe got the ribbon.\n\n320\n00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:31.890\nWe got our tabs,\nwe got our contextual tabs.\n\n321\n00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:34.760\nThese little guys right here.\n\n322\n00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:37.710\nThis guy right here is\nknown as your name box.\n\n323\n00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:42.350\nThe name box is going to give you the name\nof the cell that you are currently\n\n324\n00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:43.730\nactivated in.\n\n325\n00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:50.151\nFor example, if I click right here, notice\nit says A3, column and row reference.\n\n326\n00:17:50.151 --> 00:17:52.590\nSome of them might look\na little different.\n\n327\n00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:53.991\nI was like, Weekly_totals?\n\n328\n00:17:53.991 --> 00:17:57.180\nYou can name cells or have named ranges.\n\n329\n00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:00.602\nSo that might not always\nlook like cell references,\n\n330\n00:18:00.602 --> 00:18:02.945\nthey might look like named ranges.\n\n331\n00:18:02.945 --> 00:18:06.959\nAnd a cell reference is just the reference\nof the cell that you have currently\n\n332\n00:18:06.959 --> 00:18:07.659\nactivated.\n\n333\n00:18:07.659 --> 00:18:11.854\nRight next to it, this big, long line over\nhere, this is called the formula bar.\n\n334\n00:18:11.854 --> 00:18:17.993\nThe formula bar is going to display the\nitems that you have in the active cell.\n\n335\n00:18:17.993 --> 00:18:19.993\nBut sometimes they might\nlook a little different.\n\n336\n00:18:19.993 --> 00:18:24.675\nNotice how this says 45.00 with\na dollar sign and two decimal places,\n\n337\n00:18:24.675 --> 00:18:25.802\nbut it says 45.\n\n338\n00:18:25.802 --> 00:18:29.000\nThat's because we have\ncell formatting on this.\n\n339\n00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.710\nYou also might see something like, that\ndoesn't say $645 because that's a formula.\n\n340\n00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:38.380\nYou will see formulas in here\nbecause it's the result of\n\n341\n00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:41.620\nadding up all of these particular cells.\n\n342\n00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:46.460\nAll of that we will be\ncovering in different shows.\n\n343\n00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:49.650\nWe have the functions and\neverything, the Excel functions.\n\n344\n00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:51.410\nWe talk all about that here.\n\n345\n00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:55.740\nThis is really just kinda using\nthe program without the functions.\n\n346\n00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.980\nCuz there's so much in that,\nthat's why I made it a whole other show.\n\n347\n00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.427\nSo we got the name box,\nwe've got the formula bar.\n\n348\n00:19:02.427 --> 00:19:04.736\nOne little thing on here, it's tiny.\n\n349\n00:19:04.736 --> 00:19:08.507\nBut over on the right-hand side,\nyou see there's a, triny?\n\n350\n00:19:08.507 --> 00:19:09.786\nTiny little triangle.\n\n351\n00:19:09.786 --> 00:19:15.200\n[LAUGH] If you click it,\nit's going to expand the formula bar out.\n\n352\n00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.218\nCuz you could have really long,\ncomplex formulas in there,\n\n353\n00:19:18.218 --> 00:19:20.302\nyou might need to see\nit a little bit more.\n\n354\n00:19:20.302 --> 00:19:22.005\nSo that's what that button is.\n\n355\n00:19:22.005 --> 00:19:25.754\nAnother side note,\nif you just don't see the formula bar, and\n\n356\n00:19:25.754 --> 00:19:30.910\nit's like, I just don't have it, it\nexists, you just might have it unchecked.\n\n357\n00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:35.970\nDo you see on the View tab of your ribbon,\nthere is Formula Bar up here at the top.\n\n358\n00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:39.360\nAnd that's where it might be turned off.\n\n359\n00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.188\nSo just be careful about that.\n\n360\n00:19:42.188 --> 00:19:43.129\nThose are your gotchas.\n\n361\n00:19:43.129 --> 00:19:44.143\n[LAUGH] You're shaking your head.\n\n362\n00:19:44.143 --> 00:19:48.111\n&gt;&gt; That seems like a weird option to\nbe able to do in Excel, because for me,\n\n363\n00:19:48.111 --> 00:19:50.570\nthat's the entire impetus of using Excel.\n\n364\n00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:52.604\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Is so I can have data, and\n\n365\n00:19:52.604 --> 00:19:55.063\nthen do manipualtions with formuli.\n\n366\n00:19:55.063 --> 00:19:55.971\nFormuli?\n\n367\n00:19:55.971 --> 00:19:57.444\n&gt;&gt; Ooh!\n\n368\n00:19:57.444 --> 00:19:58.239\n&gt;&gt; Formulae?\n\n369\n00:19:58.239 --> 00:20:00.045\nI don't know.\n\n370\n00:20:00.045 --> 00:20:01.137\nFormulas.\nI don't think formuli is a word.\n\n371\n00:20:01.137 --> 00:20:01.834\nAnyway.\n\n372\n00:20:01.834 --> 00:20:03.123\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But formulas to give me\n\n373\n00:20:03.123 --> 00:20:06.195\nsome kind of metrics or\nsome kind of behavior or something.\n\n374\n00:20:06.195 --> 00:20:11.477\nGranted, I come from a science background,\nso maybe that's just me.\n\n375\n00:20:11.477 --> 00:20:13.083\nWhy would you ever want to\nturn off the formula bar.\n\n376\n00:20:13.083 --> 00:20:18.256\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can't give you a logical answer\nbesides you should always have it on.\n\n377\n00:20:18.256 --> 00:20:21.089\n[LAUGH] But in case it does,\nat least you know where it's at.\n\n378\n00:20:21.089 --> 00:20:23.071\nBut yeah, it's kinda like the headings.\n\n379\n00:20:23.071 --> 00:20:25.060\nLike A2, where is A2?\n\n380\n00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:25.622\nIt's right there.\n\n381\n00:20:25.622 --> 00:20:27.560\nBut if I turn the headings off,\n[LAUGH] it doesn't.\n\n382\n00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:31.354\nYeah, again,\nthe whole reason why you use Excel,\n\n383\n00:20:31.354 --> 00:20:35.339\nto have a formula bar and\nto have column and row heads.\n\n384\n00:20:35.339 --> 00:20:37.397\nIt's just the nature of the beast.\n\n385\n00:20:37.397 --> 00:20:39.447\nLet's move on.\n\n386\n00:20:39.447 --> 00:20:41.252\nLet's see, what else do I have?\n\n387\n00:20:41.252 --> 00:20:43.174\nWe did the name box.\n\n388\n00:20:43.174 --> 00:20:46.992\nDown at the bottom,\nwe have our worksheets.\n\n389\n00:20:46.992 --> 00:20:49.671\nWe have different worksheets\nwithin this workbook.\n\n390\n00:20:49.671 --> 00:20:52.158\nSo those were all kind of\nstacked down here on the bottom.\n\n391\n00:20:52.158 --> 00:20:54.805\nI've color-coded mine,\ncuz I like to be fancy.\n\n392\n00:20:54.805 --> 00:20:56.505\nAnd then you can navigate\nto them through there.\n\n393\n00:20:56.505 --> 00:21:01.141\nAnd you have little buttons back and\nforth to go ahead and take you back and\n\n394\n00:21:01.141 --> 00:21:03.500\nforth through them if you wanted to.\n\n395\n00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:07.498\nThen, down at the very bottom,\nwhere it says Ready.\n\n396\n00:21:07.498 --> 00:21:09.457\nIt's kinda small,\nyou probably don't see it very well.\n\n397\n00:21:09.457 --> 00:21:13.893\nBut right here, this whole bottom bar,\nand there's more behind my head.\n\n398\n00:21:13.893 --> 00:21:19.013\nThis whole bottom thing is going to,\nlet me move that up, there we go.\n\n399\n00:21:19.013 --> 00:21:22.620\nThat's your status bar, the whole thing.\n\n400\n00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:27.815\nAnd it does have these little guys over\nhere, these are your view buttons,\n\n401\n00:21:27.815 --> 00:21:32.356\nthis is your zoom, this is your\nzoom magnification that we have.\n\n402\n00:21:32.356 --> 00:21:34.469\nMore about that when we start navigating.\n\n403\n00:21:34.469 --> 00:21:36.789\nBut it's all the way across.\n\n404\n00:21:36.789 --> 00:21:42.599\nAnd some fun things about the status bar,\nfor example, if I selected these cells,\n\n405\n00:21:42.599 --> 00:21:47.421\ndo you notice how it gives you some\nquick summaries, you want to say?\n\n406\n00:21:47.421 --> 00:21:50.902\nIt's saying, well,\nthe average of those, and the count, and\n\n407\n00:21:50.902 --> 00:21:53.075\nthe sum of those particular cells Is this.\n\n408\n00:21:53.075 --> 00:21:56.224\nIt's kinda nice that it gives that to you.\n\n409\n00:21:56.224 --> 00:21:57.669\nSo just kinda watch that.\n\n410\n00:21:57.669 --> 00:22:03.103\nI love using that status bar, since I\ndon't really wanna perform calculations or\n\n411\n00:22:03.103 --> 00:22:05.790\nanything, but I wanna see what that is.\n\n412\n00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:10.220\nThere are a few other things in\nthe status bar if you right-click on it.\n\n413\n00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:13.031\nThat if you wanted to see this,\nthis is, again,\n\n414\n00:22:13.031 --> 00:22:15.306\na thing in all of your Office products.\n\n415\n00:22:15.306 --> 00:22:18.209\nAll of your Office products\nhave a status bar, a ribbon,\n\n416\n00:22:18.209 --> 00:22:22.645\na Quick Access Toolbar, and right-clicking\non them will give you different things.\n\n417\n00:22:22.645 --> 00:22:25.596\nNotice it was giving me\nthe average count and sum.\n\n418\n00:22:25.596 --> 00:22:29.041\nIf you wanted other\nsumarizations of formulas,\n\n419\n00:22:29.041 --> 00:22:33.164\nyou can turn on the min and\nthe max and all those fun things.\n\n420\n00:22:33.164 --> 00:22:37.034\nThe overtype mode, if you have\nan old-school keyboard where you can hit\n\n421\n00:22:37.034 --> 00:22:41.209\nthe Insert button, where it's either\nthe override or the insert mode.\n\n422\n00:22:41.209 --> 00:22:43.286\nThat gets everybody every time.\n\n423\n00:22:43.286 --> 00:22:46.976\nWell, more in Word, but\n[SOUND] it's, yeah.\n\n424\n00:22:46.976 --> 00:22:49.395\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; i do have a question about that.\n\n425\n00:22:49.395 --> 00:22:50.596\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; About the status bar.\n\n426\n00:22:50.596 --> 00:22:52.220\nThere's a count and\nthere's a numerical count.\n\n427\n00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:54.367\n[LAUGH] How are those different?\n\n428\n00:22:54.367 --> 00:22:55.016\n&gt;&gt; COUNT and COUNTA?\n\n429\n00:22:55.016 --> 00:22:59.461\n&gt;&gt; So it says count and numerical\ncount as metrics that I can have for\n\n430\n00:22:59.461 --> 00:23:01.119\nthis quick selection.\n\n431\n00:23:01.119 --> 00:23:05.336\nIs an account numerical by nature,\nor do I misunderstand something?\n\n432\n00:23:05.336 --> 00:23:11.853\n&gt;&gt; If I selected these, it says I have\ncounting 4 because that's a count.\n\n433\n00:23:11.853 --> 00:23:18.922\nBut if I counted a numerical count,\nit's [SOUND], how do I say this?\n\n434\n00:23:18.922 --> 00:23:23.677\nIt's like counting everything or\njust counting values.\n\n435\n00:23:23.677 --> 00:23:28.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, at you, so\nit's almost does it have value versus how\n\n436\n00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:32.979\nmany entities could there possibly\nbe in this selection range.\n\n437\n00:23:32.979 --> 00:23:36.573\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, COUNT and\nCOUNTA are two different functions.\n\n438\n00:23:36.573 --> 00:23:41.220\nAnd COUNTA I think of all,\ncount everything in there,\n\n439\n00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:44.564\nwhether it's a word or it's a number.\n\n440\n00:23:44.564 --> 00:23:47.240\nSo count numbers or count everything.\n\n441\n00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:50.270\nThat's what COUNT and COUNTA means.\n\n442\n00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:52.147\nSo good question, though.\n\n443\n00:23:52.147 --> 00:23:57.078\n[LAUGH] Lovely, and then the last few\nthings that we have in our environment or\n\n444\n00:23:57.078 --> 00:24:01.177\nour interface would just be a few\nlittle ones up here at the top.\n\n445\n00:24:01.177 --> 00:24:03.483\nYou have a little share button,\nyou can click on it.\n\n446\n00:24:03.483 --> 00:24:07.944\nSo if you wanted to click and share this\nin OneDrive, and we'll talk about sharing\n\n447\n00:24:07.944 --> 00:24:12.295\nworkbooks and how you can send links and\neverything in a totally other episode.\n\n448\n00:24:12.295 --> 00:24:14.621\nActually, a whole other show,\nthat would be.\n\n449\n00:24:14.621 --> 00:24:18.016\nAnd then a little smiley face.\n\n450\n00:24:18.016 --> 00:24:19.695\nHey, tell us what you think.\n\n451\n00:24:19.695 --> 00:24:24.047\nTelling Microsoft, hey, I think you\nshould add the little check box down at\n\n452\n00:24:24.047 --> 00:24:28.062\nthe bottom of the Quick Access Toolbar\nto put it down below the ribbon.\n\n453\n00:24:28.062 --> 00:24:34.535\nYou have to ask nicely for Microsoft to\nadd these functions to their products.\n\n454\n00:24:34.535 --> 00:24:37.376\nBut that's what it is,\nis a feedback button, and\n\n455\n00:24:37.376 --> 00:24:39.552\nit's just a cute little smiley face.\n\n456\n00:24:39.552 --> 00:24:43.800\nSo that should be everything we\nneed to know about our environment,\n\n457\n00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.595\nall of our technical names.\n\n458\n00:24:45.595 --> 00:24:47.122\nSo now you know where the ribbon is.\n\n459\n00:24:47.122 --> 00:24:48.752\nYou know that the ribbon has group names.\n\n460\n00:24:48.752 --> 00:24:49.924\nYou know where to find them.\n\n461\n00:24:49.924 --> 00:24:53.980\nThe Quick Access Toolbar, the title bar,\nthe status bar, the name box,\n\n462\n00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:54.968\nthe formula bar.\n\n463\n00:24:54.968 --> 00:24:59.494\nAnd, yeah, I think that's about\nit [LAUGH] for our interface so.\n\n464\n00:24:59.494 --> 00:25:03.269\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne, you have definitely given\nus a map to navigate the labyrinth that is\n\n465\n00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:05.694\nExcel, and\nhopefully not encounter the Minotaur.\n\n466\n00:25:05.694 --> 00:25:07.346\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So thank you so much for that.\n\n467\n00:25:07.346 --> 00:25:11.039\nWell, I know we got more Excel coming\nback at you, so definitely stay tuned.\n\n468\n00:25:11.039 --> 00:25:12.615\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n469\n00:25:12.615 --> 00:25:15.406\nSo signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n470\n00:25:15.406 --> 00:25:16.244\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n471\n00:25:16.244 --> 00:25:17.207\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n472\n00:25:17.207 --> 00:25:22.343\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.472\nI'm your host Justin Dennison, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.472 --> 00:00:20.697\nwe're continuing on with our Excel\n2016 Essentials for Mac series.\n\n5\n00:00:20.697 --> 00:00:23.192\nAnd well, we're gonna be looking\nat navigating a workbook.\n\n6\n00:00:23.192 --> 00:00:27.310\nAnd we have our very own navigator in\nthe studio today with us, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.950\nHow are you doing today, Vonne?\n\n8\n00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:28.933\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic.\n\n9\n00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:29.694\nHow are you doing?\n\n10\n00:00:29.694 --> 00:00:31.525\n&gt;&gt; I am doing great as well.\n\n11\n00:00:31.525 --> 00:00:35.629\nAnd well, we've seen over the last couple\nof episodes that it's very important to be\n\n12\n00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:38.821\nfamiliar with maybe even things\nthat you're like, yeah, well,\n\n13\n00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:40.261\nI already know how to do that.\n\n14\n00:00:40.261 --> 00:00:41.968\nBut you've shown me a couple of tricks and\nwell,\n\n15\n00:00:41.968 --> 00:00:43.810\nwhat kind of tricks do you\nhave up your sleeve now.\n\n16\n00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.471\n&gt;&gt; It's a great point.\n\n17\n00:00:45.471 --> 00:00:50.915\nit seems so basic or like the introductory\nchapter that everybody skips over.\n\n18\n00:00:50.915 --> 00:00:54.345\nBut this is an important part of\njust learning how to get around.\n\n19\n00:00:54.345 --> 00:00:59.457\nGetting around within our workbook,\nwithin our file, and how to select cells.\n\n20\n00:00:59.457 --> 00:01:04.977\nAnd we're gonna go over some things\nthat seem very, let's say small,\n\n21\n00:01:04.977 --> 00:01:09.950\nbut also very like apparent, but\nso many people skip over this.\n\n22\n00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.660\nAnd I've watched people\nstruggle with this, so\n\n23\n00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.190\nwe're gonna take it slow,\nwe're gonna take it step by step.\n\n24\n00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:21.230\nAnd hopefully get all the things you need\nknow to get around within a workbook.\n\n25\n00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.979\nSo why don't we go ahead and\nget started, let's jump on down.\n\n26\n00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.799\nAnd I've got my desktop,\nand we're ready to go.\n\n27\n00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.073\nSo we're gonna open up a file, so\n\n28\n00:01:30.073 --> 00:01:34.804\nI'm gonna go to the folder that has\nthe file and that is the wrong one.\n\n29\n00:01:34.804 --> 00:01:37.757\nThose are my episode notes in\ncase you're ever wondering,\n\n30\n00:01:37.757 --> 00:01:40.490\nthose are the files I use for\nmy mark down files.\n\n31\n00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.700\nLet's close that one and go over here.\n\n32\n00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.368\nThere we go, and we're going to\nopen up navigate a workbook.\n\n33\n00:01:47.368 --> 00:01:49.607\nYup, that's the name of our file.\n\n34\n00:01:49.607 --> 00:01:51.752\nSo we've got this.\n\n35\n00:01:51.752 --> 00:01:56.812\nBefore we get moving around within\nthe workbook or the worksheets,\n\n36\n00:01:56.812 --> 00:02:02.331\nlet's start off with what we're\nactually looking at right now our view.\n\n37\n00:02:02.331 --> 00:02:05.273\nRight now we are in the normal view.\n\n38\n00:02:05.273 --> 00:02:07.786\nAnd as soon as I say that I'm like\nI think that's the name of it.\n\n39\n00:02:07.786 --> 00:02:08.585\nWhy don't we check out?\n\n40\n00:02:08.585 --> 00:02:12.197\nLet's go over to the view tab,\nand yes, it's normal.\n\n41\n00:02:12.197 --> 00:02:15.178\nI was making sure like, yes,\nit's a normal in Excel.\n\n42\n00:02:15.178 --> 00:02:19.216\nI think it's like print preview, maybe\nit's normal in Word, I can't remember, but\n\n43\n00:02:19.216 --> 00:02:19.945\nthat's okay.\n\n44\n00:02:19.945 --> 00:02:21.715\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's one of those things as soon as you\n\n45\n00:02:21.715 --> 00:02:24.721\nsay it out loud, your mind immediately\ngoes, no, that's not right.\n\n46\n00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:25.449\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's not right.\n\n47\n00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:27.080\nSo you start second guessing yourself.\n\n48\n00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.470\nBut when in doubt, check it out, right?\n\n49\n00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.606\nSo that's what you should do.\n\n50\n00:02:30.606 --> 00:02:32.548\n&gt;&gt; Look at that, and\nyou rhymed right there.\n\n51\n00:02:32.548 --> 00:02:33.093\nGood job.\n\n52\n00:02:33.093 --> 00:02:36.615\n[LAUGH] Yes,\nwe are in our normal view of our workbook,\n\n53\n00:02:36.615 --> 00:02:42.100\nor really right now, our work sheet,\ncuz that's what we're looking at.\n\n54\n00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.260\nSo over here on the view tab you can see\nthat I've got some other ones in here.\n\n55\n00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.180\nWe've got normal page break preview,\nwe have page layout, and the custom views.\n\n56\n00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.330\nI pretty much always 98% of the time,\nI'm in the normal view.\n\n57\n00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:06.030\nI do like to this particular view when I\nam needing to change my page breaks of\n\n58\n00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.830\nwhen I need the next page to be printed,\nand where I want those breaks to happen.\n\n59\n00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.530\nWe'll talk all about that in some future\nepisodes, but just gonna throw it out\n\n60\n00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.180\nthere right now in case you're like,\nI don't know what's going on right now.\n\n61\n00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.180\nLet's click on it and see what happens,\nand this is what you see.\n\n62\n00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.830\nYou can see where you have the divisions\nas to where are your page ones and\n\n63\n00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:26.520\ntwos, and threes?\n\n64\n00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.130\nAnd notice that it's actually\ngoing down and then up.\n\n65\n00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.576\nAll of these can be configured\nin your print settings.\n\n66\n00:03:34.576 --> 00:03:37.010\nLike, which way do you wanna\ngo across versus down?\n\n67\n00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.854\nAnd that's because I've got a lot\nof information on this particular\n\n68\n00:03:40.854 --> 00:03:44.980\nworksheet to kind of help us\nget familiar with navigating.\n\n69\n00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.540\nAnd that's why you don't\nsee it going across.\n\n70\n00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.980\nYou're seeing it going down first.\n\n71\n00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.800\nAnd so, it's showing me where\nthe breaks are going to happen.\n\n72\n00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.936\nSo in case you're ever wondering\nif you've got these blue lines.\n\n73\n00:03:56.936 --> 00:04:01.188\nAnd sometimes it's even more zoomed out\ndepending on what type of information or\n\n74\n00:04:01.188 --> 00:04:03.388\nhow much information you have on a sheet.\n\n75\n00:04:03.388 --> 00:04:07.086\nSo this can vary from time to time.\n\n76\n00:04:07.086 --> 00:04:10.118\nAnd then,\nthe other one is the page layout view.\n\n77\n00:04:10.118 --> 00:04:13.334\nThis is kind of like kind\nof like the word view.\n\n78\n00:04:13.334 --> 00:04:18.300\n[LAUGH] I see Justin's face over there\ngoing, yeah, I feel the same way.\n\n79\n00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.930\nI don't like this view.\n\n80\n00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.320\nThis is-\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't seem intuitive to me,\n\n81\n00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.260\nin the context of Excel.\n\n82\n00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.370\nIt seems like,\nlike this is just an add-on.\n\n83\n00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.552\nThe one place where you may\nget some value out of this,\n\n84\n00:04:30.552 --> 00:04:34.959\nis I wanna check to see what it will\nlook like if I change no print settings.\n\n85\n00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:36.193\nBecause if I'm not mistaken,\n\n86\n00:04:36.193 --> 00:04:39.096\nthis is what I'm going to get if I\njust print this workbook as is, right?\n\n87\n00:04:39.096 --> 00:04:39.957\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n88\n00:04:39.957 --> 00:04:42.776\nYeah, and it is a much more visual\nrepresentation than the page\n\n89\n00:04:42.776 --> 00:04:43.900\nbreak preview.\n\n90\n00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.010\nYou're seeing the margins and\nall those things, and the header areas.\n\n91\n00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.560\nSo yeah, this is Word to me,\nthis isn't Excel.\n\n92\n00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.610\nSo that's why I don't like\nto personally work in it.\n\n93\n00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.100\nBut it's good for you to know in case\nlike, hey, this is what it looks like,\n\n94\n00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.110\nwhere am I?\n\n95\n00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.590\nAlways go to the View tab,\ncheck out the buttons at the top, and\n\n96\n00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.580\nswitch yourself back into normal view.\n\n97\n00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.590\nBehind my head, down the status bar,\nthere are a couple ones down here.\n\n98\n00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.140\nYou can see those buttons,\n\n99\n00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.230\nthose were the ones that were\ncorresponding to our different views.\n\n100\n00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:19.200\nSo that's another place that you can get\nto the different views of your workbook.\n\n101\n00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.650\nSo check that out.\n\n102\n00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.265\nSo other things while I'm on this View\ntab that we should just take notice of,\n\n103\n00:05:25.265 --> 00:05:30.306\nthat I believe we've already covered in\nthe interface episode was the formula bar,\n\n104\n00:05:30.306 --> 00:05:31.980\nmaking sure you can see it.\n\n105\n00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.460\nThat's why they call it a view tab.\n\n106\n00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.550\nMaking sure you can see\nyour grid lines too.\n\n107\n00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.650\nBecause in Excel,\nwe're using a spreadsheet application,\n\n108\n00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.350\nyou're gonna see rows and columns.\n\n109\n00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.712\nAnd these gray lines,\nthat's another thing.\n\n110\n00:05:43.712 --> 00:05:45.805\nThey don't print these gray lines,\ndo they?\n\n111\n00:05:45.805 --> 00:05:48.643\nNo, so those are known as grid lines.\n\n112\n00:05:48.643 --> 00:05:51.638\nAnd if you turn them off,\nyou don't see them anymore.\n\n113\n00:05:51.638 --> 00:05:56.580\nAnd I've seen people going, like,\nit's broken, I don't see the lines.\n\n114\n00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:57.670\nI'm like, you mean the borders?\n\n115\n00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.356\nNo, I just don't see it.\n\n116\n00:05:59.356 --> 00:06:01.713\nYou mean on the screen,\ncheck your view tab.\n\n117\n00:06:01.713 --> 00:06:03.680\nAnd they're like, that's it.\n\n118\n00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.140\nSo that can throw people off too.\n\n119\n00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.150\nSo different things to\nwatch on your View tab.\n\n120\n00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.460\nThe next thing would be your zoom level.\n\n121\n00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:13.930\nWhat can I see right now?\n\n122\n00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:19.700\nAnd you can control a lot of that\nright here from your view tab.\n\n123\n00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.100\nI'm zoomed in a decent amount, so\nwe can see the text on the page.\n\n124\n00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:29.776\nBut if you drop this down, and maybe I\ngo to say a 100% and then you go to 50%.\n\n125\n00:06:29.776 --> 00:06:31.780\nOkay, I can't see that, I don't know.\n\n126\n00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.520\nBut you can see I got a lot of\ninformation is going way out here.\n\n127\n00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.006\nIt's very blurry, I understand,\nI can't even see that either.\n\n128\n00:06:38.006 --> 00:06:39.337\nBut you can go ahead and\n\n129\n00:06:39.337 --> 00:06:44.257\nuse this view tab in this drop down to go\nwhatever zoom magnification that you want.\n\n130\n00:06:44.257 --> 00:06:48.810\nThere's also a button that goes to\nkind of like a 1 to 1 ratio, a 100%.\n\n131\n00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.800\nAnd that's where you can zoom out there.\n\n132\n00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.975\nI don't tend to do my zooms through\nthe View tab on the ribbon.\n\n133\n00:06:57.975 --> 00:07:01.483\nI always actually use a shortcut,\nwhich I'll show you.\n\n134\n00:07:01.483 --> 00:07:07.199\nBut again, behind my head you can\nsee down in that status bar you have\n\n135\n00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:14.035\nyour zoom slider, right here, to where if\nI drag it left it's going to zoom out.\n\n136\n00:07:14.035 --> 00:07:18.372\nAnd then going to the right\nit's going to zoom in, so\n\n137\n00:07:18.372 --> 00:07:21.340\nI can see, now that's pretty big.\n\n138\n00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.820\nI'm also zoomed into\nthe screen magnification.\n\n139\n00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.380\nSo that's okay, I can see my text.\n\n140\n00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.899\nYou can also click the little buttons,\nthe little plus and minus to the left and\n\n141\n00:07:31.899 --> 00:07:35.756\nright a bit if you wanted to click,\nclick, click, versus slide.\n\n142\n00:07:35.756 --> 00:07:41.631\nAnd you also have a little percentage\nright down here that when you click on it,\n\n143\n00:07:41.631 --> 00:07:46.261\nit brings up a dialogue box to\nwhere you can choose a particular\n\n144\n00:07:46.261 --> 00:07:47.968\nzoom magnification.\n\n145\n00:07:47.968 --> 00:07:53.743\nSo I have to say my eyes are getting\na little older there Justin, and.\n\n146\n00:07:53.743 --> 00:07:57.588\nThese studio lights are quite\nbright [LAUGH] and so\n\n147\n00:07:57.588 --> 00:08:01.670\nour eyes get a little\nolder as we get older.\n\n148\n00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:03.385\n&gt;&gt; Well-\n&gt;&gt; Wow, I'm just talking in circles now.\n\n149\n00:08:03.385 --> 00:08:07.650\n&gt;&gt; Vonne, I will say you don't have to\nnecessarily have trouble with vision.\n\n150\n00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:08.700\nI'm not trying to brag,\n\n151\n00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:12.960\nmy vision is all right, I'm still\na little short in the tooth, so to speak.\n\n152\n00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.570\nBut I tend to run very large text sizes\nin general because we stare at a computer\n\n153\n00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:18.110\nscreen a great deal, right?\n\n154\n00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:21.390\nSo if you don't need to look at\na whole lot of real estate I\n\n155\n00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:25.010\nwould zoom that up anyway,\nwhich actually brings me to my question.\n\n156\n00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:26.840\nWhen you click those plus and\n\n157\n00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.510\nminus buttons are we\nincrementing by 10% by default?\n\n158\n00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:36.040\nOr does it just increment when you zoom up\nand down using the plus and minus buttons?\n\n159\n00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:36.924\n&gt;&gt; You know what?\n\n160\n00:08:36.924 --> 00:08:39.210\nThat's a good point.\n\n161\n00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:42.565\nLook, it does look like it's\nI've never noticed that.\n\n162\n00:08:42.565 --> 00:08:44.280\n[LAUGH] Yeah, you know what?\n\n163\n00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.620\nIt looks like it's going\nin 10% increments.\n\n164\n00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:48.975\nGood to know, yes it does.\n\n165\n00:08:48.975 --> 00:08:53.070\n[LAUGH] Or at least it is today,\nat this point and time,\n\n166\n00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:58.355\nwhile we're on this taping of the show so,\ngood to know, all right.\n\n167\n00:08:58.355 --> 00:09:01.450\nSo, I tend to like my shortcuts\nwhen it comes to my zoom.\n\n168\n00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:07.449\nIn a PC world, if you do Ctrl scroll,\nlike if you have a mouse,\n\n169\n00:09:07.449 --> 00:09:09.686\nI always have a mouse, okay?\n\n170\n00:09:09.686 --> 00:09:14.360\nI can't only operate on a touch pad,\nI just am.\n\n171\n00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.754\nAnd maybe it's because I'm\nmore of a designer and\n\n172\n00:09:16.754 --> 00:09:19.210\nI have to do a lot of work with the mouse.\n\n173\n00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:21.560\nNow, in a Mac, if you want to,\n\n174\n00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:26.450\nit's not just control,\nit's Cmd Ctrl, those two keys.\n\n175\n00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:29.220\nIf you hold those two keys\ndown on your keyboard and\n\n176\n00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:34.520\nthen scrolly wheel up or\nscrolly wheel down.\n\n177\n00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:40.050\nYou see how to move it over here,\nI am zooming out and zooming in.\n\n178\n00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:42.728\nIt might have to do with\nyour mouse gestures too.\n\n179\n00:09:42.728 --> 00:09:44.296\nI got really far, gosh I'm at 10%.\n\n180\n00:09:44.296 --> 00:09:46.180\nOkay, let's go ahead.\n\n181\n00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:50.710\nIt's a little backwards because\nI'm scrolling down to zoom in.\n\n182\n00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:55.110\nIn PC world you have to\nscroll up to zoom out.\n\n183\n00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:58.150\nBasically just hold those two keys,\nscroll down, scroll up and\n\n184\n00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:59.070\nfigure out which one it is.\n\n185\n00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:00.420\nAnd then move from there.\n\n186\n00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:01.900\n&gt;&gt; Now, Vonne, a quick followup question.\n\n187\n00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:06.290\nI know Mac can, cuz you and I actually\ndisagree on this about our respective\n\n188\n00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:10.390\ndirection that is up and\ndown, so to speak.\n\n189\n00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:11.790\nDoes this affect that?\n\n190\n00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:13.390\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to say [LAUGH].\n\n191\n00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:15.368\nYou got so choked up on that question,\ndidn't you.\n\n192\n00:10:15.368 --> 00:10:16.210\n&gt;&gt; I did, I did.\n\n193\n00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:17.005\nI'm excited.\n\n194\n00:10:17.005 --> 00:10:21.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm going to say,\ntentatively, yes.\n\n195\n00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:25.100\nI'm assuming that that is,\nyou would have to check.\n\n196\n00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.850\nWe would need to go into our settings.\n\n197\n00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:29.560\nYeah, the natural gestures versus.\n\n198\n00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:33.910\nI'm always backwards, considered,\nmy husband gets on me too, and\n\n199\n00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:35.560\nI get on his computer and\nI'm like this is all wrong.\n\n200\n00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.950\nHe's like no,\nyours is the one that's wrong.\n\n201\n00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:39.390\nYou know what?\n\n202\n00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:40.880\nI think it has something to do with it.\n\n203\n00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:46.470\nSo double check that, maybe I just\nlike being backwards, what can I say?\n\n204\n00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:48.068\nBut I do like that shortcut, it's fun.\n\n205\n00:10:48.068 --> 00:10:52.165\nCtrl and Cmd, and then scrolly wheel up,\nscrolly wheel down.\n\n206\n00:10:52.165 --> 00:10:55.490\nTalking about that scroll\nsince I'm already.\n\n207\n00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:59.330\nBy the way, I have a magic mouse\nbecause I love the magic mouse.\n\n208\n00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:03.200\nI'm an Apple girl through and through, I\npretty much have every product they have.\n\n209\n00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:10.610\nSo, with the magic mouse, I do have\nboth vertical and horizontal scrolling,\n\n210\n00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:16.710\non my mouse gestures that I have,\nso I can actually go diagonal too.\n\n211\n00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:19.334\nThis is not something that,\nif you do not have a magic mouse,\n\n212\n00:11:19.334 --> 00:11:22.022\nI cannot guarantee that this is\ngoing to happen to you, okay?\n\n213\n00:11:22.022 --> 00:11:24.592\nWe'll get to when we start scrolling and\neverything, but\n\n214\n00:11:24.592 --> 00:11:26.170\nsince you're watching me do this.\n\n215\n00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:27.740\nIf you're wondering,\n\n216\n00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:32.750\nthat is the particular hardware that\nI have that is allowing me to do it.\n\n217\n00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:38.160\nOkay, cool, so now we've gotten\ninto the zoom and the view.\n\n218\n00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.550\nLet's talk about moving\naround in our worksheet.\n\n219\n00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:47.280\nAnd, Justin, trivia question,\ndo you know how many rows and\n\n220\n00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.660\ncolumns that you can have\nwithin one worksheet?\n\n221\n00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:53.112\n&gt;&gt; A lot by a bunch?\n\n222\n00:11:53.112 --> 00:11:56.470\nl know there is a finite limit.\n\n223\n00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:59.391\nI've never reached the finite limit,\nso I do not know right offhand.\n\n224\n00:11:59.391 --> 00:12:06.595\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well I will tell you,\nthat you can have 16,384 columns.\n\n225\n00:12:06.595 --> 00:12:11.592\nAnd you can have 1,048,576 rows.\n\n226\n00:12:11.592 --> 00:12:12.578\nWhoo!\n\n227\n00:12:12.578 --> 00:12:13.227\n&gt;&gt; Whoo!\n\n228\n00:12:13.227 --> 00:12:16.643\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now, Vonne, that's interesting because\n\n229\n00:12:16.643 --> 00:12:20.470\nI don't know if I would want to work\nin a worksheet that is that size.\n\n230\n00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:24.440\nIt seems like there may be,\neven though that's the finite limitation,\n\n231\n00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.110\nthe actual physical\nlimitation of the product,\n\n232\n00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:29.600\nyou might run into some\nproblems as you approach that.\n\n233\n00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.053\nAm I correct in that assertion?\n\n234\n00:12:31.053 --> 00:12:36.470\n&gt;&gt; If you're gonna use 1 million rows in a\nworksheet then you should be using Access.\n\n235\n00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:39.350\nOr you should be using some other type\nof product to be able to hold that\n\n236\n00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:40.005\ninformation.\n\n237\n00:12:40.005 --> 00:12:42.290\nI'm not saying,\nI'm not passing judgement if you are.\n\n238\n00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:44.080\nBut that gets a little unwieldy.\n\n239\n00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.500\nAnd that's just one work sheet,\n\n240\n00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:51.075\nyou could have up to 255 work\nsheets within a work book.\n\n241\n00:12:51.075 --> 00:12:58.017\nAnd that's actually what happened,\ncuz they used to be 65,536 rows and\n\n242\n00:12:58.017 --> 00:13:02.747\n255 columns,\nthese are all in increments of two,\n\n243\n00:13:02.747 --> 00:13:06.972\nthe expanse that everything\nin computers are.\n\n244\n00:13:06.972 --> 00:13:10.972\nThat was before the XLS file format,\nthe XLSX file format,\n\n245\n00:13:10.972 --> 00:13:15.330\nwhen they went to the XML extension and\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n246\n00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.810\nThat's where they increased\nthe overall size or\n\n247\n00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:22.340\ncapacity that your worksheets\ncould go ahead and occupy.\n\n248\n00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:26.410\nAnd we went over some of that stuff in the\nvery beginning in our introduction about\n\n249\n00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:28.460\nthe file formats and what have you.\n\n250\n00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:31.141\nSo just a little tidbit\nof information there and\n\n251\n00:13:31.141 --> 00:13:34.502\nhow I'm going to navigate within\nall those rows and cells.\n\n252\n00:13:34.502 --> 00:13:39.353\nLet's talk about your mouse\ncursor icons before we get too\n\n253\n00:13:39.353 --> 00:13:41.740\nfar else down another path.\n\n254\n00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:46.068\nThis is the part that you\ngotta watch what you're doing.\n\n255\n00:13:46.068 --> 00:13:47.200\nI always tell people, you know what?\n\n256\n00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:52.266\nStop, take a breath, look at what you\ndoing, pay attention, because what your\n\n257\n00:13:52.266 --> 00:13:57.574\nmouse cursor looks like is what's going to\nhappen on the screen and in your product.\n\n258\n00:13:57.574 --> 00:14:02.417\nThis is really for everything in\ncomputers but in Excel, again,\n\n259\n00:14:02.417 --> 00:14:05.763\nI've watched it just\ncause tears in people,\n\n260\n00:14:05.763 --> 00:14:11.200\nand maybe one of them was me,\ntime to time, [LAUGH] so it happens.\n\n261\n00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.330\nWhat I see on the screen right\nnow is a white plus sign.\n\n262\n00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:18.160\nMy mouse cursor right now\nlooks like a white plus.\n\n263\n00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.300\nThat indicates that you\nare in a cell selector.\n\n264\n00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:25.930\nAs opposed to if I'm over here, in\nthe ribbon over here, I got a black arrow.\n\n265\n00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:27.740\nWhite plus, you can select a cell.\n\n266\n00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:31.520\nSo if I click right here I\nhave selected this cell.\n\n267\n00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.910\nThis is cell D4, I'm looking at my\ncolumn and my row reference, and\n\n268\n00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:37.050\nthis is my active cell.\n\n269\n00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:38.730\nHow do I know it's an active cell?\n\n270\n00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:41.030\nBecause it's got a little\ngreen border around it.\n\n271\n00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:43.290\nSo this indicates active cell.\n\n272\n00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:47.550\nWell watch what happens when you're on\nan active cell, watch your mouse cursor.\n\n273\n00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:52.340\nHere, I'm zoomed out so\nit's kind of freaking out a little bit.\n\n274\n00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:56.790\nOkay, oop, come on, hold on, right there.\n\n275\n00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:57.450\nDo you see that?\n\n276\n00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:59.570\nIt looks like a little hand.\n\n277\n00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:04.209\nThis hand is where I'm at any\nedge of this active cell.\n\n278\n00:15:04.209 --> 00:15:04.960\nThere you go.\n\n279\n00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.220\nAnd it's a little further down right now\nbut just know that here on the edge.\n\n280\n00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:10.488\nBut if I go right about\nthere again my mouse is,\n\n281\n00:15:10.488 --> 00:15:12.780\nyou see how it's not lining up right now?\n\n282\n00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:16.390\nIt's okay, don't worry about it,\nit's the black plus sign.\n\n283\n00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:19.760\nIf you have a black plus sign\nthat is the fill handle.\n\n284\n00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:23.704\nYour white plus sign, versus your hand,\n\n285\n00:15:23.704 --> 00:15:30.250\nversus your black plus sign,\nall do completely different actions.\n\n286\n00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:32.430\nThe white plus is your cell selector.\n\n287\n00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:34.200\nYour hand is your move.\n\n288\n00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:38.981\nYour black arrow or black plus sign,\nexcuse me, is your fill handle,\n\n289\n00:15:38.981 --> 00:15:41.390\nall within a very small area.\n\n290\n00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:45.470\nSo be very aware of that\nparticular mouse icon.\n\n291\n00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:47.440\nMore to come on what those all do.\n\n292\n00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.180\nBut just know.\n\n293\n00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:50.391\nAnd yet my alignment's just\na little off right now.\n\n294\n00:15:50.391 --> 00:15:54.146\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was just going to reiterate\nthat we're seeing some artifacts of some\n\n295\n00:15:54.146 --> 00:15:56.704\ndigital representations and\nbeing able to zoom so.\n\n296\n00:15:56.704 --> 00:15:58.471\nWell, you can see.\n\n297\n00:15:58.471 --> 00:16:02.879\nBut that actually will be on those border\nedges or inside or at the corner or\n\n298\n00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:04.740\nthat turns into a black arrow.\n\n299\n00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:11.452\nIt's a little offset but I can confirm\nthat Von is telling you the right thing.\n\n300\n00:16:11.452 --> 00:16:12.163\n&gt;&gt; Okay, [LAUGH] thank you.\n\n301\n00:16:12.163 --> 00:16:15.900\nYeah, it's just kind of what you\njust said, very technical stuff.\n\n302\n00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.908\nAll right, so just know about that.\n\n303\n00:16:17.908 --> 00:16:20.618\nBut keep it on those mouse icons\nof what we're going to look at.\n\n304\n00:16:20.618 --> 00:16:25.122\nWhen I hover up on my column references,\n\n305\n00:16:25.122 --> 00:16:30.880\ndo you see how I get a black\narrow pointing down?\n\n306\n00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:35.440\nThat indicates that I\nwill select the column.\n\n307\n00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:39.775\nThe whole column,\nmeaning all of the cells in those\n\n308\n00:16:39.775 --> 00:16:44.260\n1,048,000 rows down in column G.\n\n309\n00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:51.410\nIf I hover over my rows,\nif I hover over number six over here and\n\n310\n00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:54.136\nI click that’s selecting the entire row.\n\n311\n00:16:54.136 --> 00:16:57.150\nSo your black like\nthicker if you wanna say,\n\n312\n00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:03.180\narrows pointing down to the right\nindicate selections of columns and rows.\n\n313\n00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:08.230\nBut if you come right\nin between my columns,\n\n314\n00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:10.850\nyou get a line with two pointed arrows.\n\n315\n00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:13.740\nThat indicates changing the column width.\n\n316\n00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:17.130\nIf you come over here to the rows.\n\n317\n00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:19.210\nWhat do you think that's gonna be?\n\n318\n00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:20.890\nChanging a row height.\n\n319\n00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:24.450\nOkay.\nSo that versus that.\n\n320\n00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:26.020\nTwo different things.\n\n321\n00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:29.090\nHere, all of these mouse\ncursor icons are going to do\n\n322\n00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:31.820\nvery different things when\nit comes to selection.\n\n323\n00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.880\nNow it's, I feel it's part of navigating.\n\n324\n00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.180\nI guess you can say it's more\nof a selection technique.\n\n325\n00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:40.950\nBut if you don't know how to get to\nwhere you're going to select a thing,\n\n326\n00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:42.920\nit's going to kind of all come into play.\n\n327\n00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.380\nSo, very basic stuff.\n\n328\n00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:51.985\nThe other thing in the top left\nhand corner of your columns and\n\n329\n00:17:51.985 --> 00:17:55.220\nrows, you have this big box right there.\n\n330\n00:17:55.220 --> 00:18:00.320\nNotice that it turns into a white\nplus sign, when I click this,\n\n331\n00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.160\nthis is going to select the entire sheet.\n\n332\n00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:08.850\nSo, all of your 65,000 columns,\n1 million rows, all will be selected when\n\n333\n00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:14.230\nyou click up in that top left hand corner\nbetween your column and row references.\n\n334\n00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:18.730\nNow to deselect, I'm just clicking off,\nmeaning in some blank area right here.\n\n335\n00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:25.360\nTo then deselect that selection of\nthe sheet, cool, so all our mouse cursors.\n\n336\n00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:26.230\nNow let's move around.\n\n337\n00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:28.340\nWe talked about scrolling right?\n\n338\n00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:31.190\nIn the sense of I have a magic mouse,\nso I can see,\n\n339\n00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:35.530\nI can move my mouse up,\ndown, my finger going left,\n\n340\n00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:40.150\nright and that's going to give me\nmy horizontal and vertical scrolls.\n\n341\n00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:46.200\nBut if you see if I hover down here\nI get this kind of gray line across.\n\n342\n00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:52.190\nThat's where I can then take and\nhorizontally scroll across.\n\n343\n00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:56.940\nAlso notice in your column references,\nonce it gets to z then it goes to aa, ab,\n\n344\n00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:02.290\nand then all the way through to z and\nthen ba, bb, bc.\n\n345\n00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:04.060\nThat's where it's getting all of those.\n\n346\n00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:08.050\nAnd if I hover again,\nsee they don't show up unless they're\n\n347\n00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:12.690\nnot like designated scroll areas or\nscroll bars like I feel PC has.\n\n348\n00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:17.320\nYou just kinda have to hover and\nthen it pops up.\n\n349\n00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.560\nSame thing with over here\non the right hand side.\n\n350\n00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:23.950\nSee, if I hover there's\nmy vertical scroll.\n\n351\n00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:26.470\nAnd then I can go ahead and\nclick and hold.\n\n352\n00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:27.900\nAnd scroll with that.\n\n353\n00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:34.140\nSo mouse, horizontal,\ndifferent ways to go about it.\n\n354\n00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.490\nNow lets get to the keyboard, all right?\n\n355\n00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:38.410\nI brought in another piece of hardware.\n\n356\n00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:39.730\nI am just going to flip this upside down.\n\n357\n00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:43.240\nthis is a full size keyboard that I have,\n\n358\n00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:46.480\nthat is a Mac keyboard that I\nhave plugged into my computer.\n\n359\n00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:52.290\nYet, I've got a laptop with\nan extra old keyboard and a mouse.\n\n360\n00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:55.240\nKind of defeats the purpose of\na laptop there doesn't it Justin?\n\n361\n00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:59.340\n&gt;&gt; You gotta bring the appropriate\ntools necessary to get the job done.\n\n362\n00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:01.086\nI mean that's important.\n\n363\n00:20:01.086 --> 00:20:04.650\nAnd I'm gonna before I move on because\nI keep a wireless keyboard at all\n\n364\n00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:05.240\ntimes just in case.\n\n365\n00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.740\n&gt;&gt; I was just about to say,\nevery time I go see you at your desk,\n\n366\n00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:09.840\nyou always have your keyboard out too.\n\n367\n00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah just got a better feel to it,\nI like it.\n\n368\n00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and I mean, I do this for\n\n369\n00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.980\ndesign work too because I need\nto use the number pad a lot.\n\n370\n00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:20.140\nAnd I also need and I know it's kind of\nhard for you to see this right here and\n\n371\n00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:24.450\nyou can't read it but these keys\nright here, the home and the end.\n\n372\n00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:27.800\nThe e n d key, the page up and page down.\n\n373\n00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:34.200\nI know you can map them on your laptop,\nI'm just old school, I just want a button.\n\n374\n00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.030\nI want a button that goes up and down,\n\n375\n00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:40.720\npage up page down because I use those so\nmuch in my products.\n\n376\n00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.860\nSo that's why I purchased\nthis keyboard and\n\n377\n00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:48.790\nhardwired in with my little Dongle\nbecause I have a USB C and it's a USB.\n\n378\n00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:53.920\nGoodness, thank you Mac, for\nalways changing our ports on us.\n\n379\n00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:58.635\nSo I have this because I can use\ndifferent keys on this particular\n\n380\n00:20:58.635 --> 00:21:01.704\nkeyboard that I don't have on my laptop.\n\n381\n00:21:01.704 --> 00:21:04.941\nThese fist ones are on your left top,\nso how do you think,\n\n382\n00:21:04.941 --> 00:21:07.240\nl am gonna put on this spot there Justin.\n\n383\n00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:12.550\nOn my keyboard, how do you think\nl can get one cell to the right?\n\n384\n00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:14.060\n&gt;&gt; Hit the right arrow key.\n\n385\n00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.080\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n386\n00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:17.750\nYou're right, yes,\n\n387\n00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:22.510\nso take the right arrow key,\nget to the right, had it gone to the left?\n\n388\n00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:23.700\n&gt;&gt; Hit the left arrow key.\n\n389\n00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:24.900\n&gt;&gt; I think you're on a roll.\n\n390\n00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.330\nHow about up and down?\n\n391\n00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:28.700\n&gt;&gt; Up arrow key and down arrow key?\n\n392\n00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:30.390\n&gt;&gt; You get a cookie.\n\n393\n00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:31.540\n&gt;&gt; What kind of cookie?\n\n394\n00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:33.144\n&gt;&gt; I do have some M&amp;Ms in this desk.\n\n395\n00:21:33.144 --> 00:21:34.232\n&gt;&gt; No, we should probably do this show.\n\n396\n00:21:34.232 --> 00:21:37.118\n&gt;&gt; I actually really do have M&amp;Ms.\n\n397\n00:21:37.118 --> 00:21:39.910\n[LAUGH] So yes, up and\ndown, left and right,\n\n398\n00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:43.250\nyou can use your arrow keys\nto get around on there.\n\n399\n00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:49.930\nPage Up and Page Down, okay, that will\njump you by what I call it screen shots.\n\n400\n00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:53.400\nYou see, I'm row 43 and\n64 and now I'm on 64 and 85.\n\n401\n00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:59.360\nSo I'm going by chunks up and down.\n\n402\n00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.480\nLove using page up and page down.\n\n403\n00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.250\nI use it all the time in Word as well.\n\n404\n00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:06.110\nSo that's one way you can get around.\n\n405\n00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:07.300\nAnd I'm out here.\n\n406\n00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:09.280\nI'm using my mouse by the way now.\n\n407\n00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.430\nI'm out here in row g.\n\n408\n00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:13.520\nSorry, column g, row nine.\n\n409\n00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:19.510\nIf I hit the home key on my keyboard,\nit's going to take me to the first column,\n\n410\n00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:22.197\nin this case column a,\nof that particular row, okay?\n\n411\n00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:23.900\nThat's fun.\n\n412\n00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:24.630\nLike that one.\n\n413\n00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:26.940\nI'm gonna click my mouse back out here.\n\n414\n00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:34.910\nAnother one that's my favoirtie in Excel,\nin PC land, it's control home.\n\n415\n00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:36.716\nI'm just gonna come down way out here.\n\n416\n00:22:36.716 --> 00:22:38.820\nSo, I'm like way down, I am in K63.\n\n417\n00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.260\nThat is my active cell, right?\n\n418\n00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:46.560\nYou can get down that far and\nit is also the same on a Mac keyboard.\n\n419\n00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:52.220\nControl not command, control home\nwill always take you back to A1.\n\n420\n00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:57.240\nIt will always take you\nback to the toppest left.\n\n421\n00:22:58.580 --> 00:22:59.110\nIt's A1.\n\n422\n00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:02.090\n[LAUGH] Cuz you can get\nway far down there.\n\n423\n00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:05.530\nIt's the easiest way to get there and\nI really love that.\n\n424\n00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:10.570\nSo, that's kinda some fun things that\nyou can do and again, it's control.\n\n425\n00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:15.700\nThere is another one that you can do,\ncontrol end, E-N-D.\n\n426\n00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:16.860\nNow where does it go?\n\n427\n00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:20.770\nLook and I put some cell information\nout there says, I'm the end.\n\n428\n00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:25.818\nBecause that's all the way out in column\nAT, row 88, I put some information there.\n\n429\n00:23:25.818 --> 00:23:28.960\nSo what Ctrl+End does,\n\n430\n00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:35.010\nis take you to the last part of,\nthe last cell that has information,\n\n431\n00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:40.020\nthe furthest down and the furthest across\nthat's the end of where you're going.\n\n432\n00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:43.437\n&gt;&gt; Now Von, that's something to call\nattention to because that behavior is\n\n433\n00:23:43.437 --> 00:23:46.689\na little bit different in Excel,\nI use a similar keyboard shortcut for\n\n434\n00:23:46.689 --> 00:23:49.629\nsome of my applications,\nI'll get that out and just a moment.\n\n435\n00:23:49.629 --> 00:23:53.953\nBut it takes you to the last\ndata entry of the worksheet,\n\n436\n00:23:53.953 --> 00:23:56.259\nnot to the last row, column.\n\n437\n00:23:56.259 --> 00:23:57.034\nNot that, but\n\n438\n00:23:57.034 --> 00:24:00.467\nabsolute end of the worksheet\ntakes you to the last data entry.\n\n439\n00:24:00.467 --> 00:24:01.634\n&gt;&gt; And that's exactly what it's doing.\n\n440\n00:24:01.634 --> 00:24:03.243\nThat is the last data entry.\n\n441\n00:24:03.243 --> 00:24:07.023\nBecause if I,\nthere's some other ways we can do, but\n\n442\n00:24:07.023 --> 00:24:09.880\nin the data entry, yes you are correct.\n\n443\n00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:14.614\nSo if I did Control, Home,\nfirst, that's always Home.\n\n444\n00:24:14.614 --> 00:24:17.525\nA-1 Control End, way down there.\n\n445\n00:24:17.525 --> 00:24:19.740\nThat's where it's gonna\nhave the last data entry.\n\n446\n00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:21.558\nOkay, so\nI'm gonna go back to Control Home.\n\n447\n00:24:21.558 --> 00:24:23.479\nAnd you've gotta play around with this and\nstart to get familiar with it.\n\n448\n00:24:23.479 --> 00:24:29.152\nBecause there's some other things\nthat you can do and that is.\n\n449\n00:24:29.152 --> 00:24:34.139\nHere, if I'm in this, first of all, let me\njust show you that this Hello World goes\n\n450\n00:24:34.139 --> 00:24:36.970\nall the way down to here,\nokay, to rows 76.\n\n451\n00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:40.906\nSo this is what you would call\na Contiguous Range of Information,\n\n452\n00:24:40.906 --> 00:24:42.921\nin the same row, now watch this.\n\n453\n00:24:42.921 --> 00:24:49.935\nIf I take this, and if I do Command,\nnot Control, Command, right arrow key.\n\n454\n00:24:49.935 --> 00:24:55.142\nIt's taking me to the end of\nthat Contiguous Amount of Data.\n\n455\n00:24:55.142 --> 00:24:57.432\nLet's come over here, right here.\n\n456\n00:24:57.432 --> 00:25:03.584\nControl, sorry,\nCommand right arrow takes me to the end or\n\n457\n00:25:03.584 --> 00:25:07.655\nthe furthest right of that data range.\n\n458\n00:25:07.655 --> 00:25:10.850\nI'm gonna do Control+Home to get me down.\n\n459\n00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:12.451\nDown arrow to get me here.\n\n460\n00:25:12.451 --> 00:25:19.663\nSo, Command right, now, if I do\nCommand down look at where it's going.\n\n461\n00:25:19.663 --> 00:25:23.704\nSo I can Command left,\nCommand up, Command right.\n\n462\n00:25:23.704 --> 00:25:27.506\nYou see, how I'm just going to\nthe four corners of this dataset or\n\n463\n00:25:27.506 --> 00:25:29.729\nthis data range, kinda fun, right?\n\n464\n00:25:29.729 --> 00:25:33.136\nIf I'm in a specific data range,\nnow watch if I did this.\n\n465\n00:25:33.136 --> 00:25:39.748\nCommand right arrow,\nCommand right arrow again, where am I?\n\n466\n00:25:39.748 --> 00:25:42.370\nI am in column XFV.\n\n467\n00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:51.082\nIf I do Command down, it's gonna be\nbehind my head, look at where I'm at.\n\n468\n00:25:51.082 --> 00:25:55.822\nI'm at the very last\ncorner of this Worksheet,\n\n469\n00:25:55.822 --> 00:25:59.290\nI'm in row 1,048,576.\n\n470\n00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:02.852\nSo, you see how it goes\ninto your data ranges.\n\n471\n00:26:02.852 --> 00:26:08.560\nAnd then, you can go all to\nthe four corners of your worksheet.\n\n472\n00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:12.580\nBy your Command and your right and\nleft and up and down arrows.\n\n473\n00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:15.453\n&gt;&gt; So, it seems Command has a little\ndifferent behavior depending on\n\n474\n00:26:15.453 --> 00:26:16.129\nwhere you are.\n\n475\n00:26:16.129 --> 00:26:19.960\nIt's essentially going to the bounding\narea of whatever's defined.\n\n476\n00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.800\nSo, if you're in a data range,\nContiguous Range,\n\n477\n00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:25.135\nyou go to the bounding\nareas of that range.\n\n478\n00:26:25.135 --> 00:26:29.282\nYou're outside, then we just kinda\nskate to the end of rows and columns.\n\n479\n00:26:29.282 --> 00:26:29.914\n&gt;&gt; Of the sheet.\n\n480\n00:26:29.914 --> 00:26:30.754\n&gt;&gt; Of the actual sheet.\n\n481\n00:26:30.754 --> 00:26:32.138\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n482\n00:26:32.138 --> 00:26:36.038\n&gt;&gt; That would be handy to keep here,\ncuz I would see me going.\n\n483\n00:26:36.038 --> 00:26:36.555\nWhere am I?\n\n484\n00:26:36.555 --> 00:26:37.926\n&gt;&gt; Yes [LAUGH].\n\n485\n00:26:37.926 --> 00:26:39.606\n&gt;&gt; So,\nthat's important distinction to make.\n\n486\n00:26:39.606 --> 00:26:44.268\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and that's why,\nI always tell people when in doubt,\n\n487\n00:26:44.268 --> 00:26:46.702\nif you need to, Control Home.\n\n488\n00:26:46.702 --> 00:26:50.516\nNow, if you have a laptop,\nyou don't have a home key most likely, but\n\n489\n00:26:50.516 --> 00:26:51.430\ntry to get to it.\n\n490\n00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:54.492\nAnd if you really lost, I can show\nyou another way to get there, okay?\n\n491\n00:26:54.492 --> 00:26:59.050\nSo, it's kinda like I don't know where I'm\nat, let me get back to the very beginning.\n\n492\n00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:01.400\nIf you have a Home Key on your keyboard,\nyou can do that.\n\n493\n00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:05.518\nBut there is another way that\nyou can get around some things.\n\n494\n00:27:05.518 --> 00:27:07.630\nAnd it's this area right up here.\n\n495\n00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:09.466\nDo you remember what this\nthing is called there?\n\n496\n00:27:09.466 --> 00:27:11.441\nWell, look at that I covered,\nwhat is that Justin?\n\n497\n00:27:11.441 --> 00:27:13.411\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Can I still answer anyway?\n\n498\n00:27:13.411 --> 00:27:15.147\n&gt;&gt; Go ahead.\n&gt;&gt; It's called the name box?\n\n499\n00:27:15.147 --> 00:27:15.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n500\n00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:19.208\n&gt;&gt; All right, I mean,\nI am five for five today.\n\n501\n00:27:19.208 --> 00:27:20.470\n&gt;&gt; Gave away the answer.\n\n502\n00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:22.011\nSo, this is the Name Box and\n\n503\n00:27:22.011 --> 00:27:26.714\nthis is where it's gonna show you where is\ncutting off maybe a little bit off there.\n\n504\n00:27:26.714 --> 00:27:31.090\nBut, it's showing you where, there we go,\nI just move the mouse over [LAUGH].\n\n505\n00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:36.235\nOf what cell you're in, but\nyou can also use that to navigate.\n\n506\n00:27:36.235 --> 00:27:41.213\nIf I have her up here, noticed how it\ngets in i-beam to where I can click.\n\n507\n00:27:41.213 --> 00:27:46.187\nAnd if I type in A1,\ndoesn't matter if it is capitalized,\n\n508\n00:27:46.187 --> 00:27:50.040\nand I hit enter, it takes me back to A1.\n\n509\n00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:55.592\nSo you can use the Name Box to navigate,\ni tend to not, honestly, I just don't.\n\n510\n00:27:55.592 --> 00:27:59.330\nI have other shortcuts, especially if\nI am using my keyboard and everything.\n\n511\n00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:03.042\nAnd then, these little drop down arrows,\nthese are like, what are these?\n\n512\n00:28:03.042 --> 00:28:05.302\nThese are named ranges.\n\n513\n00:28:05.302 --> 00:28:07.900\nYou can, it's kinda like\ngiving it a nickname, okay.\n\n514\n00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:09.730\nAnd you can use it to navigate.\n\n515\n00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:12.904\nIf I click on meow, okay,\nooh, where did it take me?\n\n516\n00:28:12.904 --> 00:28:14.200\nLet me scroll out so you can see.\n\n517\n00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:18.874\nIt actually took me to this particular\nContiguous Range of cells that I\n\n518\n00:28:18.874 --> 00:28:19.754\nnamed Meow.\n\n519\n00:28:19.754 --> 00:28:21.860\nAnd it's also on worksheet five.\n\n520\n00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:25.029\nIf I drop this down and\ngo to daily totals.\n\n521\n00:28:25.029 --> 00:28:31.025\nWell that's a named range of cells\non sheet four, it looks like.\n\n522\n00:28:31.025 --> 00:28:36.328\nSo you can use named ranges in formulas,\nways to just give a nickname to places.\n\n523\n00:28:36.328 --> 00:28:40.053\nI'll show you,\nthere's actually in our Functions, so\n\n524\n00:28:40.053 --> 00:28:43.010\nwe talk about that and\nhow you use a formulas.\n\n525\n00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:46.145\nAnd l believe in advanced series where we\nactually talked about naming ranges, but\n\n526\n00:28:46.145 --> 00:28:47.324\njust wanna point that one out.\n\n527\n00:28:47.324 --> 00:28:50.984\n&gt;&gt; So now, we're getting name ranges\nwith the Name Box absolutely within\n\n528\n00:28:50.984 --> 00:28:52.030\nthe work book.\n\n529\n00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:55.570\nRegardless of the sheets, so\nyou may have a whole list of those.\n\n530\n00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:58.200\nBut then, maybe on different sheets and\nyou kinda bounce around, right?\n\n531\n00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:02.307\n&gt;&gt; Correct yes, and\nyou do name it by the range of cells and\n\n532\n00:29:02.307 --> 00:29:07.415\nthe worksheet that it is on in\nthat particular workbook, correct.\n\n533\n00:29:07.415 --> 00:29:11.694\nAnd that being said, if I needed\nto navigate around my worksheets,\n\n534\n00:29:11.694 --> 00:29:14.485\ndown here, how do you think you do it?\n\n535\n00:29:14.485 --> 00:29:17.274\n&gt;&gt; Well, I would probably just click on\nthem until with reckless abandon, and\n\n536\n00:29:17.274 --> 00:29:18.246\nhope nothing bad goes on.\n\n537\n00:29:18.246 --> 00:29:24.075\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, click Reckless Abandon\nwill get you somewhere else.\n\n538\n00:29:24.075 --> 00:29:29.609\nSingle click Navigate To, double click,\nactually gives you a shortcut to Rename.\n\n539\n00:29:29.609 --> 00:29:33.366\nWhich is nice, if you wanna rename your\nsheets and people are like [NOISE],\n\n540\n00:29:33.366 --> 00:29:34.830\nokay and then you click off.\n\n541\n00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:37.090\nBut anyway, double clicking will Rename or\ngive you a name.\n\n542\n00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:41.871\nGive you the option to name\nyour worksheets while on here,\n\n543\n00:29:41.871 --> 00:29:46.663\nin your full keyboard,\nif you have a page up and page down.\n\n544\n00:29:46.663 --> 00:29:51.136\nIf you use your control, not command,\ncuz I just tried it with a command and\n\n545\n00:29:51.136 --> 00:29:53.490\nit doesn't work, Control Page down.\n\n546\n00:29:53.490 --> 00:30:00.560\nLook at my worksheet tabs, five, six,\nCtrl+PageUp, five, four, three, two, one.\n\n547\n00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:05.098\nSo you can switch back and forth from\nworksheets if you have a Control key.\n\n548\n00:30:05.098 --> 00:30:08.373\nWell, you should have\na Control Key on that keyboard and\n\n549\n00:30:08.373 --> 00:30:10.225\nyou have the page up on there.\n\n550\n00:30:10.225 --> 00:30:12.481\nSo that takes me to the end.\n\n551\n00:30:12.481 --> 00:30:17.023\nI'm gonna do one quick one, even though\nthis gets into when we do our data entry,\n\n552\n00:30:17.023 --> 00:30:18.127\nwhen we insert data.\n\n553\n00:30:18.127 --> 00:30:23.400\nIs how you can use your tab key,\nyour shift tab, and your enter key.\n\n554\n00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:26.772\nThose one thing that I didn't do and\nI use this all the time.\n\n555\n00:30:26.772 --> 00:30:29.550\nSo, I'm here on this particular cell.\n\n556\n00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:36.167\nHitting the Tab key on the keyboard\nwill take you one cell to the right.\n\n557\n00:30:36.167 --> 00:30:38.155\nDo you know how to go to\nthe left with a Tab key?\n\n558\n00:30:38.155 --> 00:30:38.823\n&gt;&gt; Shift+tab.\n\n559\n00:30:38.823 --> 00:30:40.175\n&gt;&gt; You are correct, my gosh.\n\n560\n00:30:40.175 --> 00:30:43.480\n&gt;&gt; Man, I am gonna get a pay\nraise after this episode.\n\n561\n00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.230\n&gt;&gt; You also saw it in the notes,\ndidn't you?\n\n562\n00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:45.876\n&gt;&gt; Quit giving away my secrets.\n\n563\n00:30:45.876 --> 00:30:51.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So shift tab,\nhold the Shift key and click the Tab key.\n\n564\n00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:53.048\nThat will take you to the left.\n\n565\n00:30:53.048 --> 00:30:56.260\nNow the, I'm clicking with my mouse.\n\n566\n00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:59.981\nThe enter key on your keyboard\ntakes you down, okay?\n\n567\n00:30:59.981 --> 00:31:04.077\nJust goes down, Shift Enter takes you up.\n\n568\n00:31:04.077 --> 00:31:05.942\nBut, how do you use those in succession?\n\n569\n00:31:05.942 --> 00:31:08.040\nI am using my mouse now and\nI am clicking here.\n\n570\n00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:12.015\nWatch, if I, okay, where am, G10, right?\n\n571\n00:31:12.015 --> 00:31:16.152\nTab, Tab, Tab, now I'm gonna Enter,\n\n572\n00:31:16.152 --> 00:31:19.696\nit's like a carriage term [LAUGH].\n\n573\n00:31:19.696 --> 00:31:21.492\n&gt;&gt; Ahh, that was unexpected,\nVaughan, you caught me with that, or\n\n574\n00:31:21.492 --> 00:31:23.370\nshould I have asked that question\ncuz I would have gotten that wrong.\n\n575\n00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:30.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Man, yes, so, c from where\nyou start Tabbing, and then you enter.\n\n576\n00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:35.669\nIt will carriage return down to the next\nrow from where you started Tabbing from.\n\n577\n00:31:35.669 --> 00:31:38.450\nSo Tab, Tab, Tab, Enter,\nTab, Tab, Tab, Enter.\n\n578\n00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:41.900\nNow, if I Enter, again,\nI am like kinda cancel it out.\n\n579\n00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:46.761\nSo, it has to be in succession if I Tab,\nTab, Tab, Enter, Tab, Tab,\n\n580\n00:31:46.761 --> 00:31:50.503\nTab, Enter, Tab, Tab,\nright arrow, right arrow.\n\n581\n00:31:50.503 --> 00:31:54.100\nDo you see how now the Enter,\nit's like it gets out of its cycle.\n\n582\n00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:57.809\nYou have to use them in conjunction,\nTab, Enter, Tab, Enter.\n\n583\n00:31:57.809 --> 00:32:02.764\nYou do anything else, it stops\nthe remembrance of the starting point and\n\n584\n00:32:02.764 --> 00:32:05.200\ngets you out of the loop.\n\n585\n00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.826\nSo, okay, I know that was a little late.\n\n586\n00:32:07.826 --> 00:32:09.970\nI know I've looked over at\nthe clock a couple of times.\n\n587\n00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:11.382\nAnd I'm a couple minutes over, but\n\n588\n00:32:11.382 --> 00:32:13.841\nI couldn't leave this episode\nwithout at least covering it.\n\n589\n00:32:13.841 --> 00:32:16.646\nBecause I realized in my\nnotes that I skipped over it.\n\n590\n00:32:16.646 --> 00:32:20.380\nBut we'll be using this in some other\nepisodes, so it will come back around.\n\n591\n00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:24.599\nSo hope that was some good ah-ha moments,\nmaybe.\n\n592\n00:32:24.599 --> 00:32:27.840\nGetting around a workbook or worksheet\nthat you thought would be pretty simple.\n\n593\n00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:31.735\nBut hopefully, you can now take a break,\nlook at those icons.\n\n594\n00:32:31.735 --> 00:32:34.623\nMake sure you watch those\nicons are gonna be so\n\n595\n00:32:34.623 --> 00:32:37.367\nimportant to just use Excel all together.\n\n596\n00:32:37.367 --> 00:32:38.160\n&gt;&gt; Well Vaughan,\n\n597\n00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:42.743\nyou've definitely helped me increase my\nproductivity because that Tab-Enter thing.\n\n598\n00:32:42.743 --> 00:32:46.924\nThere are so many times when I've used the\narrows to get back to the next row down,\n\n599\n00:32:46.924 --> 00:32:48.352\nback to my original point.\n\n600\n00:32:48.352 --> 00:32:50.530\nGonna have to file that away,\nand you should as well.\n\n601\n00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:53.803\nRemember all these tips and tricks\nbecause they're gonna come in handy as\n\n602\n00:32:53.803 --> 00:32:56.087\nwe continue our progression\nin Excel Essentials.\n\n603\n00:32:56.087 --> 00:32:57.857\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n604\n00:32:57.857 --> 00:33:00.630\nSo signing of OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n605\n00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:01.465\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vuaghan Smith.\n\n606\n00:33:01.465 --> 00:33:02.362\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n607\n00:33:02.362 --> 00:33:08.038\n[SOUND]\n\n",

OfficePro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.140\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.660\nyou're back with more Excel\n2016 Essentials for Mac.\n\n5\n00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.110\nAnd well, we're gonna be looking at\nselecting cells in this episode.\n\n6\n00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.610\nAnd you're like, well, hold on a second,\nthat seems, I don't know, I don't know.\n\n7\n00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.640\nBut luckily, we have someone that's going\nto reveal all to us, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.380\nHow you doing today, Vonne?\n\n9\n00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.580\n&gt;&gt; Good, it's like, that seems so simple.\n\n10\n00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.930\nYeah, it is,\nif you know what you're doing.\n\n11\n00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.040\nSo that's why I'm here to tell you all the\ndifferent ways that you can select cells.\n\n12\n00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.400\nWith your mouse, with your keyboard,\nsome little shortcuts that can help you.\n\n13\n00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.475\nAnd we actually talked about this\nin between episodes of like some of\n\n14\n00:00:53.475 --> 00:00:59.190\nthe things I'm gonna show you are kind\nof across, so a lot of programs.\n\n15\n00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.260\nSo just kinda keep this in mind and\nmaybe try it out,\n\n16\n00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.350\nbut we'll just see as we go,\nhow about that?\n\n17\n00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.200\nI think I told you to say\nthat somewhere in there, and\n\n18\n00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.290\nI just kinda stole it from you,\ndidn't I there, Justin [LAUGH]?\n\n19\n00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.130\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nI'm gonna allow it this time, Vonne.\n\n20\n00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.141\nI'm not gonna hold it against you cuz,\nwell, it is your show.\n\n21\n00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:18.475\nSo, you're gonna show\nus how to select cells,\n\n22\n00:01:18.475 --> 00:01:21.875\nand I enjoy a good keyboard shortcut\nas much as the next person, so\n\n23\n00:01:21.875 --> 00:01:23.915\nI'm kinda interested to\nsee what you show us.\n\n24\n00:01:23.915 --> 00:01:28.315\n&gt;&gt; All right, yeah, well, you had so many\nright answers in the last episode that I\n\n25\n00:01:28.315 --> 00:01:32.000\nhad to get something right for\nmyself, so [LAUGH].\n\n26\n00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.750\nAll right, so\nwhy don't we go ahead and start?\n\n27\n00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.580\nLet's jump down in the computer,\nI actually have the same file that I had\n\n28\n00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.090\nopened in the last episode where we were,\nwhat we were doing?\n\n29\n00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.614\nWe were navigating, okay,\nand now we're selecting.\n\n30\n00:01:46.614 --> 00:01:49.270\nTalked about the white plus sign.\n\n31\n00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.280\nThe white plus sign of your mouse\ncursor is very important because that's\n\n32\n00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.210\ngoing to select the cell.\n\n33\n00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.209\nSo if I told you I would like you\nto select cell D5, you would come\n\n34\n00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:03.824\nfrom to the, no, don't click on there,\nthat's selecting the column.\n\n35\n00:02:03.824 --> 00:02:07.980\nLook at D, where is 5,\nwhere do they intersect?\n\n36\n00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.128\nThat is cell D5.\n\n37\n00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:13.020\nI single-clicked, so\nif I wanna select a single cell,\n\n38\n00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.040\nyou single-click, and\nthat is your active cell.\n\n39\n00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.230\nOkay, perfect.\n\n40\n00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.811\nI wanna select cell H2, you click,\nthat's your selected cell.\n\n41\n00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:25.510\nBut a lot of times you're\nnot just selecting one cell,\n\n42\n00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.320\nyou need to select multiple cells.\n\n43\n00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.330\nSo, how do you do it?\n\n44\n00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.080\nFirst way with your mouse,\nyou click, hold, and you drag.\n\n45\n00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.710\nSo, white plus sign.\n\n46\n00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.590\nOops, sorry,\nmy mouse moved over a little bit.\n\n47\n00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.910\nWhite plus sign, click, hold,\ndrag down, let go of your mouse.\n\n48\n00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.480\nI have selected a range of cells.\n\n49\n00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.400\nAnytime you have a selected range of\ncells, if you want to deselect or\n\n50\n00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.570\njust not have them active anymore,\nyou just click off.\n\n51\n00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.340\nJust go and click off somewhere,\nyep, that's that.\n\n52\n00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.680\nJust click off to the side, or\nsome non-selected cell, and\n\n53\n00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.320\nthen it deselects that particular range.\n\n54\n00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.300\nSo you can click, hold, and drag with\nyour white plus sign as much as you need.\n\n55\n00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.320\nLet go, click, hold, drag.\n\n56\n00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.990\nNotice that every time I start to click,\nhold, drag again,\n\n57\n00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:20.170\nit's going to deselect that one I already\nhad and then make a new selection.\n\n58\n00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.080\nBe careful about the double-clicking and\nthen, well,\n\n59\n00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.070\nactually it did work, but\njust watch the mouse cursor.\n\n60\n00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.152\nWhite plus always selects,\nso you're good there.\n\n61\n00:03:31.152 --> 00:03:33.760\nAll right, click, hold,\ndrag, one way to do it.\n\n62\n00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.048\nSo, we, sorry, I see Justin making a face,\nso I don't know if I should stop and\n\n63\n00:03:38.048 --> 00:03:40.433\nask you, or\nshould I just keep going [LAUGH]?\n\n64\n00:03:40.433 --> 00:03:43.236\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, I was gonna let you go,\nbut since you brought me on the spot,\n\n65\n00:03:43.236 --> 00:03:45.542\nactually, the double-click,\nif there's text in there,\n\n66\n00:03:45.542 --> 00:03:47.350\nthere's something I have done before.\n\n67\n00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.250\nYou accidentally drag\nthe text into another cell.\n\n68\n00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.928\nSo it's not immediately evident there,\nbut you're like, well,\n\n69\n00:03:53.928 --> 00:03:57.980\nwhere'd that cell's text or number,\nor whatever it may be, the contents.\n\n70\n00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.690\nAnd you may accidentally drag it to\nanother cell or do some crazy stuff.\n\n71\n00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.300\nSo, if you double-click and drag, but\nit's empty, maybe it's no big deal.\n\n72\n00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.453\nBut if it's not,\nyou may get weird behaviors.\n\n73\n00:04:06.453 --> 00:04:09.880\n&gt;&gt; And the other thing is\nmaybe it was already selected,\n\n74\n00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.483\nand then you clicked, hold, and drag.\n\n75\n00:04:12.483 --> 00:04:13.620\nThat's not a white plus sign,\n\n76\n00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.890\nI mean, it's kinda small right now,\nbut that's not a white plus, is it?\n\n77\n00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.240\nSo, it's like, I'm already selecting\na cell, and then I try to drag it.\n\n78\n00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.730\nWell, it, of course,\njust did it, it's not.\n\n79\n00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.590\nBut you're right, it will move,\n\n80\n00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.620\nbecause we are gonna talk about moving\ncells around, and it can happen.\n\n81\n00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.210\nAnd also, if I double-click,\n\n82\n00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.190\nI'm actually activating my flashing\ncursor into that active cell.\n\n83\n00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.720\nAnd then if I click, hold, and drag, now\nI'm just selecting the text inside of that\n\n84\n00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.485\ncell, not the click, hold,\ndrag to select the cells themselves.\n\n85\n00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.340\nLittle things.\n\n86\n00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.690\nNow let's talk about this range.\n\n87\n00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.840\nWhen I click, hold, and drag,\nI'm making a range selection.\n\n88\n00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.804\nI don't know how many times I've\ndone this where if I started here.\n\n89\n00:04:54.804 --> 00:04:56.980\nLet me get that white plus sign.\n\n90\n00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.190\nClick, hold, and drag, and then I start,\nand I'm holding my mouse down still.\n\n91\n00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.868\nAnd I start going, it's like woo,\nand then it gets way out of control.\n\n92\n00:05:03.868 --> 00:05:04.920\nI'm like whoa, stop, and\n\n93\n00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:11.120\nI can't really control when it\ngoes past that one screenshot.\n\n94\n00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.170\nSo there's an easier way to\ncontrol how you select ranges.\n\n95\n00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.400\nAnd I'm going to use my fancy shortcut,\ncuz I have my full keyboard,\n\n96\n00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.870\nwith my Ctrl+Home key to get me\nall the way back to cell A1.\n\n97\n00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.320\nNow there's a range selection\nusing your Shift key.\n\n98\n00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.720\nThe Shift key is how you can\nselect from point A to point B and\n\n99\n00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.440\neverything in between.\n\n100\n00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.250\nLet me show you.\n\n101\n00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.120\nIf I single-click, single-click,\nlet go, that's my starting point.\n\n102\n00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.125\nNot holding any keys right now, okay?\n\n103\n00:05:41.125 --> 00:05:45.450\nI'm just using my scroll to scroll down.\n\n104\n00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.340\nVisually looking, that's my end.\n\n105\n00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.940\nDon't click it yet, okay?\n\n106\n00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.340\nBut I know that's the end.\n\n107\n00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:55.050\nI want everything between where I started,\nnavigated down.\n\n108\n00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.956\nThis is the end, hold the Shift key,\nsingle-click, and\n\n109\n00:05:59.956 --> 00:06:03.976\nyou have now selected,\nif I scroll out of this.\n\n110\n00:06:03.976 --> 00:06:07.237\nOoh, whoa, that's a lot here,\nwhy don't we come back over here?\n\n111\n00:06:07.237 --> 00:06:09.280\n[LAUGH] Let me use this.\n\n112\n00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.320\nThere we go, do you see how I\nhave selected all of those cells?\n\n113\n00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.640\nAnd that is to me a much\neasier way to control your\n\n114\n00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.160\nselection by using the Shift key.\n\n115\n00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.668\nSo let me just show you\nagain one more time.\n\n116\n00:06:22.668 --> 00:06:24.240\nI'm gonna single-click at the beginning,\n\n117\n00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.600\nI'm just gonna randomly\npick something out here.\n\n118\n00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.570\nHold the Shift key, single-click,\nselects everything in between.\n\n119\n00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.250\nLove that shortcut, use it all the time.\n\n120\n00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.460\nThis is the same in Word,\nthe same in selecting files.\n\n121\n00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:42.063\nIt's kind of, I don't wanna say\ncompletely across the board, but\n\n122\n00:06:42.063 --> 00:06:44.910\nit's very, it's slightly universal.\n\n123\n00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.660\n&gt;&gt; It is a fairly ubiquitous behavior.\n\n124\n00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.530\nHolding Shift and clicking to another\none will give you a highlighted region\n\n125\n00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:52.170\nbetween those two cursor points.\n\n126\n00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:55.800\nNow, in this case, we're effectively\ndoing the upper left-hand corner and\n\n127\n00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.300\nthe lower right-hand for\nthis entire range.\n\n128\n00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.600\nBut I don't have to do that, I can\nactually do subsections of that range.\n\n129\n00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.500\nThis still works,\neverything's good, right?\n\n130\n00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.830\nSo, if I just want the first six rows.\n\n131\n00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:10.307\nAnd so I click the upper left-hand corner,\ngo down six rows, boom, and\n\n132\n00:07:10.307 --> 00:07:11.440\nit's still good.\n\n133\n00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.020\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n134\n00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:17.770\n&gt;&gt; Follow up question to this, and maybe\nI'm jumping ahead, so tell me if I am.\n\n135\n00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.310\nI only wanted to go rows 1 through 5.\n\n136\n00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:22.530\nHow do I fix that?\n\n137\n00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.370\nDo I have to reselect everything, or not?\n\n138\n00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.310\n&gt;&gt; When I have people just learning,\n\n139\n00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.200\nI say, if you didn't get it right\nthe first time, stop and start again.\n\n140\n00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.510\nWhen they're first getting familiar\nwith it, but yes, you totally can.\n\n141\n00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:37.670\nModifying that range, let's talk about it.\n\n142\n00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.000\nIf I go, let's say, cell A8.\n\n143\n00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:44.500\nSingle-click, hold my Shift key, go to 10.\n\n144\n00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.250\nOoh, I was really only wanting to 6,\nup here.\n\n145\n00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:51.120\nI want to contract my selection.\n\n146\n00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:57.582\nKeep the Shift key held down, click here,\nand it takes away that selection.\n\n147\n00:07:57.582 --> 00:07:58.489\nI only wanted to go to 3.\n\n148\n00:07:58.489 --> 00:08:00.998\nOoh, you know what,\nI needed to go over two more columns.\n\n149\n00:08:00.998 --> 00:08:07.659\nAs long as I keep that Shift key held down\nI can expand or contract a selection,\n\n150\n00:08:07.659 --> 00:08:14.440\nor arrange selection depending on how much\nI need to take away or add back into.\n\n151\n00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:19.360\nSo yes, you can modify,\nif you wanna say, the selection.\n\n152\n00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:22.570\n&gt;&gt; So essentially, our first click is\nan anchor point and then the second click,\n\n153\n00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:25.454\nwhether it be the first second click,\nthe second second click or maybe\n\n154\n00:08:25.454 --> 00:08:26.173\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n155\n00:08:26.173 --> 00:08:28.563\n&gt;&gt; But the subsequent clicks are setting\n\n156\n00:08:28.563 --> 00:08:30.960\nthe boundary from that anchor point.\n\n157\n00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.665\nYou can almost think of it like putting\na pin on the string and then you're just\n\n158\n00:08:34.665 --> 00:08:38.038\ndetermining where the string lands\nto bound out that region, right?\n\n159\n00:08:38.038 --> 00:08:39.233\nThat might be an over simplification but.\n\n160\n00:08:39.233 --> 00:08:41.385\n&gt;&gt; That's a great way of explaining it.\n\n161\n00:08:41.385 --> 00:08:45.030\nI'm going to have to take that and\n[LAUGH] use that again.\n\n162\n00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:47.870\n&gt;&gt; And I'll say,\ncuz Justin used this explanation,\n\n163\n00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.535\nI think that's a perfect one, good job.\n\n164\n00:08:49.535 --> 00:08:51.185\n[LAUGH] You get another cookie.\n\n165\n00:08:51.185 --> 00:08:55.014\n[LAUGH] All right, so there's some\ndifferent ways that you can expand and\n\n166\n00:08:55.014 --> 00:08:57.728\ncontract with the Shift key\nlike I just showed you.\n\n167\n00:08:57.728 --> 00:09:01.000\nLet's talk about multiples.\n\n168\n00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.940\nOr also known as non-contiguous ranges or\nnon-contiguous cells.\n\n169\n00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.330\n&gt;&gt; Contiguous means all together.\n\n170\n00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:11.040\nThis right here, Shift click,\nthat is a contiguous range.\n\n171\n00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.620\nEven if it doesn't have any data,\nit's still meaning all together.\n\n172\n00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:21.168\nBut what if I wanted to click hold drag,\nget that, and I want something over here.\n\n173\n00:09:21.168 --> 00:09:26.330\nYou can't use your Shift key, cuz that's\njust gonna bring it all the way across.\n\n174\n00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:30.140\nIf you hold your Command key,\nclick, hold, and\n\n175\n00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:34.690\ndrag, you can make multiple selections.\n\n176\n00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:36.470\nClick, hold, drag.\n\n177\n00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:38.900\nMaybe go ahead and then click, hold, drag.\n\n178\n00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.844\nI'm holding my Command key the whole time,\ncuz I always like to go ahead and\n\n179\n00:09:42.844 --> 00:09:44.294\nmake a little smiley face.\n\n180\n00:09:44.294 --> 00:09:48.700\nSo, I have selected all of these cells.\n\n181\n00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:50.447\nThey can be ranges, they could be single.\n\n182\n00:09:50.447 --> 00:09:54.110\nHolding the Command key, single click,\nsingle click, single click.\n\n183\n00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:56.290\nAll of those are selected cells.\n\n184\n00:09:56.290 --> 00:10:00.660\nSo maybe you wanna take like this,\nlike different values and\n\n185\n00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.200\nmake them all red at one time.\n\n186\n00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:08.461\nJust Cmnd-click or Cmnd and click hold and\ndrag, and you can go ahead and\n\n187\n00:10:08.461 --> 00:10:13.821\nget multiple ranges or sorry multiple\nnon-contiguous cells selected.\n\n188\n00:10:13.821 --> 00:10:15.250\nKind of fun stuff with that.\n\n189\n00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:21.320\nNow, you can also use your keyboard\nto be able to do this as well.\n\n190\n00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.649\nI'm going to start here.\n\n191\n00:10:22.649 --> 00:10:25.280\nI'm gonna switch down under my keyboard.\n\n192\n00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:29.497\nHolding the Shift key, cuz we talked about\nthat with our range, holding it down and\n\n193\n00:10:29.497 --> 00:10:31.800\nthen using your arrow\nkeys will help as well.\n\n194\n00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:38.290\nSo holding my Shift key and then right\narrowing over, I'm selecting those cells.\n\n195\n00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:44.990\nKeeping the Shift key held down, using my\ndown arrow key now I'm selecting, down.\n\n196\n00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:50.080\nIf I hold my Shift key and click\nthe left arrow key I am contracting so\n\n197\n00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:57.050\nthe same way that you were using\nthe Shift to expand and collapse ranges.\n\n198\n00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:58.420\nYou can use your Shift key as well.\n\n199\n00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:02.628\nNow, you can get super crazy if you\nwanted to remember our command right\n\n200\n00:11:02.628 --> 00:11:07.860\narrows command up and down what's going\nto are different boundaries of our cells?\n\n201\n00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:12.220\n&gt;&gt; The same thing you can do here if\nI hold my Shift, hold my Command and\n\n202\n00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:17.350\nuse my right arrow, see it goes all\nthe way over to the last corner.\n\n203\n00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:21.106\nIf you want to say it of that contiguous\ninformation, hold the Shift and\n\n204\n00:11:21.106 --> 00:11:22.366\nthe Command key still.\n\n205\n00:11:22.366 --> 00:11:26.750\nClick the down arrow key you\nsee how I went ahead and\n\n206\n00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:32.250\nselected all of that range of\ndata that is next to each other.\n\n207\n00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:33.620\nSo you can use the Command and\n\n208\n00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:38.840\nthe Shift key to go ahead to start\nmanipulating how you can use it.\n\n209\n00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:43.760\nYou could also then, you start using your\nmouse first, then hold the Shift key and\n\n210\n00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.420\nuse your left arrow.\n\n211\n00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:47.430\nMaybe down or up arrow.\n\n212\n00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:49.400\nSo you can use these all in\nconjunction with each other.\n\n213\n00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:54.540\nIt just depends on what way\nis the easiest for you to do.\n\n214\n00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.730\nPretty neat, okay, so\nwe've got our Shift key.\n\n215\n00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:01.210\nWe've got our Command key.\n\n216\n00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:02.689\nDifferent ways to do it.\n\n217\n00:12:02.689 --> 00:12:04.920\nThere's also a select all.\n\n218\n00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:09.490\nSelect all, what do you think the keyboard\nshortcut's gonna be there Justin for all?\n\n219\n00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:13.060\n&gt;&gt; Well I'm going to be completely\ntransparent, I've looked at the notes.\n\n220\n00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:16.202\nThis is actually a keyboard\nshortcut that I used, it's CMND+A.\n\n221\n00:12:16.202 --> 00:12:19.081\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; For a Mac it's Ctrl+A for\n\n222\n00:12:19.081 --> 00:12:20.779\nother systems\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n223\n00:12:20.779 --> 00:12:22.614\n&gt;&gt; So be very careful there.\n\n224\n00:12:22.614 --> 00:12:25.725\nIt's Cmnd+A for the Mac environment.\n\n225\n00:12:25.725 --> 00:12:26.905\n&gt;&gt; Correct yes.\n\n226\n00:12:26.905 --> 00:12:30.831\nAll is, and that's another one that's\nused across a lot of products,\n\n227\n00:12:30.831 --> 00:12:34.379\nthe thing is it acts differently\ndepending on where you're at.\n\n228\n00:12:34.379 --> 00:12:38.270\nOkay, we know that there's all of\nthese cells with this information.\n\n229\n00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:42.660\nIf I am single clicked inside of it,\nwatch what happens if I do Ctrl+A.\n\n230\n00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.807\nWhat do you think's gonna happen?\n\n231\n00:12:45.807 --> 00:12:47.301\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to say I\ndidn't even get to say.\n\n232\n00:12:47.301 --> 00:12:48.291\nShe took away my thunder.\n\n233\n00:12:48.291 --> 00:12:51.773\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So that makes sense because usually\n\n234\n00:12:51.773 --> 00:12:54.599\ncontiguous places within\nthe Excel context,\n\n235\n00:12:54.599 --> 00:12:57.248\nare essentially creating fences right?\n\n236\n00:12:57.248 --> 00:13:00.140\nThis is my yard and this is your yard,\nand this is our plot of land.\n\n237\n00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.121\nThis is my set of cells,\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n238\n00:13:02.121 --> 00:13:07.205\n&gt;&gt; And so I think of those when\nonce I break the continuity of it,\n\n239\n00:13:07.205 --> 00:13:09.230\nboom it's a fence.\n\n240\n00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:11.500\n&gt;&gt; Yes and that is why Ctrl+A and\n\n241\n00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:15.980\nthis information right here is going\nto only select all of in that range.\n\n242\n00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:21.870\nBut if I did it again, Ctrl+A,\nnow I've selected the entire sheet.\n\n243\n00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:24.490\nSorry, I said Ctrl, didn't I?\n\n244\n00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.885\nCmd, Cmd+A, so\nit's like okay, again watch.\n\n245\n00:13:27.885 --> 00:13:33.736\nSingle-click, Ctrl, sorry, Cmd+A, Cmd+A.\n\n246\n00:13:33.736 --> 00:13:38.250\nTwice gets you to the entire worksheet and\nall those columns and all those rows.\n\n247\n00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:42.580\nAnd we mentioned it before, up here\nat the very top in the topest left,\n\n248\n00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.200\nthe topest leftest.\n\n249\n00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:48.970\nYou can click on that and then it will go\nahead and select your entire worksheet.\n\n250\n00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:52.830\nSo different ways that Ctrl+A will work.\n\n251\n00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:58.070\nIf for any reason you need to\nselect multiple work sheets,\n\n252\n00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:00.390\nhow many times do I do this?\n\n253\n00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.700\nKind of few and in between, okay?\n\n254\n00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:09.070\nWith certain, when I do three cell\nreference formulas, then I use it.\n\n255\n00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:10.620\nBut not very much.\n\n256\n00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:15.960\nIf I wanted to select sheets one through\nfour you can hold your Shift key again.\n\n257\n00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.795\nNow, notice down here it's kind of hard\nto see but do you see how it just kind of\n\n258\n00:14:19.795 --> 00:14:22.754\nchanges to where they're all bold and\nthey're all white.\n\n259\n00:14:22.754 --> 00:14:26.280\nBecause if I single clicked you\nsee how sheet five is selected.\n\n260\n00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.920\nSingle click three is selected.\n\n261\n00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.820\nSingle click hold the shift key.\n\n262\n00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.570\nSingle click on four they're all white and\nbold.\n\n263\n00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:38.670\nSo if you ever wanted to select\nmultiple sheets, that is how you do it.\n\n264\n00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:44.821\nAll right, so, what else do we need to do,\nknow about with selecting cells?\n\n265\n00:14:44.821 --> 00:14:46.760\nYes, Justin?\n\n266\n00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.305\n&gt;&gt; Actually, I have a follow-up\nquestion about the sheet thing?\n\n267\n00:14:49.305 --> 00:14:53.070\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm?\n&gt;&gt; So those are contiguous sheets.\n\n268\n00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:55.555\nWhat if I want three five and six?\n\n269\n00:14:55.555 --> 00:14:56.330\n&gt;&gt; Like that.\n\n270\n00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:57.160\nOne three and five.\n\n271\n00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, is it still Shift or\nis it a different.\n\n272\n00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:01.176\n&gt;&gt; It's Command.\n\n273\n00:15:01.176 --> 00:15:02.710\n&gt;&gt; Ahh gotcha.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, good point.\n\n274\n00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:04.481\nIt's just like our cells,\n\n275\n00:15:04.481 --> 00:15:08.883\nif I want a non-contiguous selected\nsheets holding your Cmnd key.\n\n276\n00:15:08.883 --> 00:15:12.742\n[LAUGH] It's hard to remember,\nwhat operating system am I using.\n\n277\n00:15:12.742 --> 00:15:18.028\nAnd because, we talked about it in\nthe other episode, we can use the Control\n\n278\n00:15:18.028 --> 00:15:23.890\nkey on that to do certain shortcuts to\nnavigate and everything, so the selection.\n\n279\n00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:27.666\nYes, you are correct,\ncommand will select it.\n\n280\n00:15:27.666 --> 00:15:32.450\nThere`s one thing I`m looking at my notes,\nbefore we get into named ranges.\n\n281\n00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:36.813\nThat I wanted to point out is that,\nwhen you have multiple worksheets,\n\n282\n00:15:36.813 --> 00:15:40.900\nwhen you start making selections,\nit remembers your selection.\n\n283\n00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:44.599\nSo for example, look at this sheet five.\n\n284\n00:15:44.599 --> 00:15:48.980\nYou remember, this was in the last episode\nthat I was talking about the named ranges\n\n285\n00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.494\nof selecting all of these meow,\nmeow, meows.\n\n286\n00:15:51.494 --> 00:15:55.660\nThat's still remembering on sheet\nfive that I had that selected.\n\n287\n00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.565\nIf I go over to sheet four,\nlet me just select this.\n\n288\n00:15:57.565 --> 00:16:01.243\nCome over to sheet three, look at that,\n\n289\n00:16:01.243 --> 00:16:06.868\nit's still remembering all of\nthese selections that I made,\n\n290\n00:16:06.868 --> 00:16:11.640\ncuz I never really Deselected\nthem from that sheet.\n\n291\n00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:17.120\nBut just because that happens,\nlike if I for example am here and\n\n292\n00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:21.520\nI click like the bold button, or\nwhatever, maybe I'll click here and\n\n293\n00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.480\nthen click the bold button\nthat turned bold, right?\n\n294\n00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.030\nBut did those?\n\n295\n00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:26.970\nOr these?\n\n296\n00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:27.550\nNo.\n\n297\n00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:32.680\nSo the command that you're\nperforming will only\n\n298\n00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.920\nwork on the active sheet that you're on.\n\n299\n00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.140\nIt's just a thing.\n\n300\n00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:41.120\nOnly because people have asked me about\nit, why does it keep remembering?\n\n301\n00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.880\nIt just does, okay?\n\n302\n00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.780\n&gt;&gt; I almost think of it\nas a stack of papers,\n\n303\n00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.628\nwhich I guess, a sheet is just like that.\n\n304\n00:16:47.628 --> 00:16:51.650\nWhen your writing,\nunless you're using carbon paper or\n\n305\n00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:55.360\nsomething like that, you're writing on the\nsheet that you're currently focused on.\n\n306\n00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:59.080\nYou're not modifying the sheets\nthat you may reshuffle and\n\n307\n00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.680\nthen modify those as well.\n\n308\n00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.420\nEven if you have something\nthat you zoned in.\n\n309\n00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:06.510\nI need to fix the logo on this one,\nI need to add up these on this one.\n\n310\n00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:08.880\nIt's sheet by sheet individual pieces.\n\n311\n00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:12.530\nSo that kind of makes sense if you think\nof it as a physical stack of papers.\n\n312\n00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:14.027\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, another great analogy.\n\n313\n00:17:14.027 --> 00:17:14.942\nThank you.\n\n314\n00:17:14.942 --> 00:17:16.360\n[LAUGH] Very good.\n\n315\n00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.440\nAnd it's just the behavior of Excel.\n\n316\n00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.540\nThat's what it does.\n\n317\n00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:22.490\nIt just kind of remembers your selections.\n\n318\n00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:27.940\nNow, named ranges, we did touch up\non this on the other episode of.\n\n319\n00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:33.740\nIt's like a nickname for\ncells whether it's a range of cells or\n\n320\n00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:38.130\na single cell, you can give it a name\n\n321\n00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:43.170\nrather than let's say right\nover here on Sheet 1.\n\n322\n00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:48.940\nSo the cell C2, that's a hard one,\n\n323\n00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:54.030\nIf I select that in the name box right\nup here it is saying that this is C2.\n\n324\n00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:57.450\nWell maybe I don't want to\nkeep referring to it as C2,\n\n325\n00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:00.220\nI want to refer to it as Hello World.\n\n326\n00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.340\nI want to give it a name.\n\n327\n00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:06.790\nJust like I had given\nthis range of cells here,\n\n328\n00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:10.430\nall of these are the meow cells,\nI want to do that.\n\n329\n00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:11.600\nYou totally can.\n\n330\n00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.430\nAnd we have more, we have other\nepisodes where we talk about this.\n\n331\n00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:16.590\nBut I'm just going to go ahead and\ntouch upon this right now.\n\n332\n00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:19.220\nYou make a selection and\nyou give it a nickname.\n\n333\n00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:22.320\nThat is over in the formulas path.\n\n334\n00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.420\nAnd then you go into your define names.\n\n335\n00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:26.930\nNow when you define your names.\n\n336\n00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:28.620\nThe only thing is, notice here.\n\n337\n00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:30.960\nThat it did not keep the space.\n\n338\n00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.440\nYou can't have spaces in named ranges.\n\n339\n00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:38.220\nAnd that's one of the naming\nconventions that you have to have.\n\n340\n00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:39.860\nAnd then you had mentioned\nsomething back there,\n\n341\n00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.260\nit's specific to that particular sheet.\n\n342\n00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:46.490\nNotice in the notation,\nit's like, it is saying Sheet1,\n\n343\n00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:54.930\nthat's the name of the sheet, !, that's\nreferring to the sheet, and then $C$2.\n\n344\n00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:57.040\nThat's indicating an absolute reference,\n\n345\n00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.770\nthose dollar signs mean\nan absolute reference.\n\n346\n00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:02.500\nIf you don't know what I'm talking\nabout just nod and be link okay.\n\n347\n00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:03.820\nThat's where it lives.\n\n348\n00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:07.050\nSo just a little bit,\na quick little thing about named ranges.\n\n349\n00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:14.340\nHow you can do them very quickly and\nthen what and how it shows up in.\n\n350\n00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:18.090\nThe name box and\nhow you could use them to select.\n\n351\n00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:19.580\nThis is something that.\n\n352\n00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:23.870\nMaybe you are always selecting these\nparticular cells to a bunch of stuff on.\n\n353\n00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:27.350\nThat might be a reason right\nthere to use the named ranges so\n\n354\n00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:31.230\nyou can quickly get to\nthem as you want to.\n\n355\n00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:37.170\nTalking about the go to or finding,\n\n356\n00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:45.030\non the home tab and this is a PC thing,\nin Excel for PC on the home tab there's\n\n357\n00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:48.640\na button way over here on the right\nhand side of the ribbon called find and\n\n358\n00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:53.030\nselect and you can drop it down and\nsay find the formulas.\n\n359\n00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:57.570\nAnd there's some kind of fun stuff\nthat it will allow you to find, and\n\n360\n00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:01.060\nit basically navigates and\ntakes you to it, and\n\n361\n00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:07.890\nit selects those particular types of\ninformation, for lack of better terms.\n\n362\n00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:15.690\nYou don't have that button in Excel for\nMac, but you do have A go to.\n\n363\n00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:19.880\nNotice in the Edit menu, in the Find,\nthere is Go To dot dot dot.\n\n364\n00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.950\nAnd it will take you to places.\n\n365\n00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:26.195\nNow you're like, what does this mean?\n\n366\n00:20:26.195 --> 00:20:28.205\nRemember those selected yet?\n\n367\n00:20:29.615 --> 00:20:30.845\nJessica went like this.\n\n368\n00:20:30.845 --> 00:20:35.445\nThose remembered ranges of cells that I\ntold you like on those different sheets,\n\n369\n00:20:35.445 --> 00:20:39.015\nif I click on it and click okay,\nit's going to take me to that.\n\n370\n00:20:39.015 --> 00:20:42.187\nSo it might be Another reason\nwhy you might want to keep them.\n\n371\n00:20:42.187 --> 00:20:44.057\nJust like that's just how it works.\n\n372\n00:20:44.057 --> 00:20:45.917\nIt just remembers your cells.\n\n373\n00:20:45.917 --> 00:20:49.427\nThe go to will remind yourself or\n\n374\n00:20:49.427 --> 00:20:52.707\nremind Excel of where you can\nkind of jump around to it.\n\n375\n00:20:52.707 --> 00:20:57.417\nKind of neat but\nthe other thing that it can do and\n\n376\n00:20:57.417 --> 00:21:00.730\njust take notice of where I'm at\nright now meaning the worksheet.\n\n377\n00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:04.440\nIf I click Special, do you see I can go to\n\n378\n00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:09.070\ndifferent things within\nthat particular work sheet?\n\n379\n00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:13.390\nBecause if I go to Formulas,\nnot talking tonnes about formulas but\n\n380\n00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:15.080\nit's just a calculation.\n\n381\n00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:18.050\nIf I click OK,\nit's gonna say there is no cells found.\n\n382\n00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:22.560\nBut I know which formula is in here,\nits just not on G5.\n\n383\n00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:29.560\nIf I go over to sheet four, and\nthen do the Edit &gt; Find &gt; Go to,\n\n384\n00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:33.840\nand then I say Special and\nthen I go to Formulas, and I click OK,\n\n385\n00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:38.790\nnotice it is selecting these\nparticular cells in here.\n\n386\n00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:42.490\nBecause these cells are actually formulas.\n\n387\n00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:44.100\nThey're not values.\n\n388\n00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:47.900\nThey're calculated values there.\n\n389\n00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:50.610\nSo that's just something that\nyou can use if you want to.\n\n390\n00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:54.870\nThere's a lot of things in that\nGo To I'm not gonna go over.\n\n391\n00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:58.840\nAll of them, because they're are some very\ncreative ways you can use them together\n\n392\n00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.990\nwith doing things.\n\n393\n00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:04.730\nThis is an essential show, so\nwe're not going to hit those up, but\n\n394\n00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:05.940\nI wanted to point that out.\n\n395\n00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:12.560\nAnd along those same lines, the same\nlines of the finding Find and replace.\n\n396\n00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:18.000\nAnother thing that is very common\namongst all of your office products,\n\n397\n00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.860\nespecially in Word.\n\n398\n00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:24.840\nI need to find a particular word, value,\n\n399\n00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.730\nsomething and\nI can't remember where it is.\n\n400\n00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:31.590\nNow finding is one part, and\nthat's separate, and then replacing.\n\n401\n00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:34.590\nBut a lot of times you\ncan use them together.\n\n402\n00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:38.250\nI need to find all instances\nof the word fuego and\n\n403\n00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:42.310\nreplace it with fire pants,\nbecause that's his name.\n\n404\n00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:44.120\nYou know, those kind of things.\n\n405\n00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:50.260\nLast name changes, price changes,\ninstructor changes in a particular course.\n\n406\n00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:53.220\nThose types of things you can use find and\nreplace.\n\n407\n00:22:55.080 --> 00:23:01.820\nFind and Replace in Excel for\nMac isn't as extensive\n\n408\n00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:05.930\nas the Find and or\nReplace in Excel for PC.\n\n409\n00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:09.560\nIt's also not as extensive as Word, okay?\n\n410\n00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:12.450\nSo just in case you're like,\nI use this all the time in Word,\n\n411\n00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:15.260\nor I use this all the time in Excel for\nPC.\n\n412\n00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:18.760\nIt's not as robust, okay.\n\n413\n00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:22.712\nI would, what did you say, ubiquitous?\n\n414\n00:23:22.712 --> 00:23:23.220\nYeah.\n\n415\n00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:24.360\n&gt;&gt; It's a ubiquitous behavior,\n\n416\n00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:27.888\nI would say in this case, it's bnoe\nas comprehensive in functionality.\n\n417\n00:23:27.888 --> 00:23:30.653\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] Gosh [CROSSTALK] Yeah,\nbecause when I say,\n\n418\n00:23:30.653 --> 00:23:34.846\nyeah pretty much across all the programs,\nand like yes ubiquitous is like\n\n419\n00:23:34.846 --> 00:23:35.603\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that word.\n\n420\n00:23:35.603 --> 00:23:36.425\nThat's a good one.\n\n421\n00:23:36.425 --> 00:23:41.000\n[LAUGH] So yeah, so this is not\nas robust in its functionality?\n\n422\n00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:41.730\n&gt;&gt; Comprehensive.\n\n423\n00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:43.610\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\ncomprehensive in its functionality.\n\n424\n00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:45.760\nI'm gonna use Justin words right here.\n\n425\n00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.050\nWhere do I find it?\n\n426\n00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:48.320\nHm, it's in Edit menu.\n\n427\n00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.930\nWhere do I find the find, ha ha.\n\n428\n00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:52.423\nSo if I go to Edit &gt; Find,\nit is also Cmnd+F,\n\n429\n00:23:52.423 --> 00:23:54.990\nif you would like to know about that.\n\n430\n00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:56.540\nSo if I click here.\n\n431\n00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:57.530\nFind what?\n\n432\n00:23:57.530 --> 00:23:58.236\nNotice there's no options.\n\n433\n00:23:58.236 --> 00:23:59.870\nThere's no drop-down.\n\n434\n00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:00.779\nThis is it.\n\n435\n00:24:00.779 --> 00:24:02.956\nThat's all you've got, with your find.\n\n436\n00:24:02.956 --> 00:24:06.923\nSo if I wanted to say find fuego.\n\n437\n00:24:06.923 --> 00:24:12.269\nYou know what, I'm going to do this\nthis way, we're going to do f-u-e-g-o.\n\n438\n00:24:12.269 --> 00:24:15.640\nSo we've got Mr. Fuego pants.\n\n439\n00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:22.170\nDo take notice of this,\nwithin the Sheet or the Workbook.\n\n440\n00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:26.180\nI know I have fuego in almost\nall of these worksheets.\n\n441\n00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:28.710\nBut if I looked right now on the sheet,\nI would only return,\n\n442\n00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:30.780\nI think there's just one, right down here.\n\n443\n00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:34.670\nSo, you need to be careful about\nwhat you're looking within.\n\n444\n00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:39.830\nAnd next do you want to search by rows or\nby columns?\n\n445\n00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:44.150\nAnd do you want to look in formulas,\nvalues or comments.\n\n446\n00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:46.980\nComments is something separate\nthat we haven't covered yet.\n\n447\n00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:50.410\nWe really haven't talked about formulas,\nwe really won't in this particular but\n\n448\n00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:53.210\njust know that there are different\nthings that you're looking for.\n\n449\n00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:58.590\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and just say,\nI just keep it in the default.\n\n450\n00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.800\nWe could go ahead and do values.\n\n451\n00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:05.280\nBecause there's no fuego in\nthe formulas named ranges.\n\n452\n00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.010\nThat's something why you\nmight want to look for it.\n\n453\n00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:09.315\nBecause you can use named\nranges in your formulas.\n\n454\n00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:13.020\nAnd then if I click Find Next.\n\n455\n00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:16.910\nNotice that it's just jumping\nmy cursor down into it.\n\n456\n00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:17.968\nAnd if I put, find next.\n\n457\n00:25:17.968 --> 00:25:21.309\nThere is another one,\nnope, that's it, okay?\n\n458\n00:25:21.309 --> 00:25:25.270\nI've come to the end of the road and\nthere's no, that's all you got.\n\n459\n00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:29.200\nThere's no list, there's no,\nI can't find anymore.\n\n460\n00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:33.470\nBut if I choose like Workbook and\nthen I go ahead and find next.\n\n461\n00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:36.420\nYou see how now it's jumping\nover to sheet three.\n\n462\n00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:42.600\nSheet four, sheet six and then back to one\nand then I'm just cycling back through.\n\n463\n00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.170\nIt's not saying like we\nfound all instances.\n\n464\n00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:47.290\nDo you wanna go back and search again?\n\n465\n00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:51.900\nYou don't have the same\nwarnings along the way.\n\n466\n00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:57.204\nAnd maybe you have noticed,\nas I'm clicking through, lowercase feugo.\n\n467\n00:25:57.204 --> 00:26:01.132\nUppercase, I guess that\nwould be proper case?\n\n468\n00:26:01.132 --> 00:26:02.518\nYes, the.\n\n469\n00:26:02.518 --> 00:26:03.437\n&gt;&gt; Title case.\n\n470\n00:26:03.437 --> 00:26:05.920\n&gt;&gt; Title case?\n\n471\n00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.568\n&gt;&gt; Capitalize first letter.\n\n472\n00:26:07.568 --> 00:26:08.369\nWe're gonna go with that one.\n\n473\n00:26:08.369 --> 00:26:10.722\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And then this one,\ncapitalize first letter.\n\n474\n00:26:10.722 --> 00:26:13.510\nAll caps, right?\n\n475\n00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:17.320\nSo that button might mean something.\n\n476\n00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:18.930\nMatch case.\n\n477\n00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:22.557\nYou guessed it.\nI want to match all lowercase instances of\n\n478\n00:26:22.557 --> 00:26:25.607\nfuego and that's the only one I have.\n\n479\n00:26:25.607 --> 00:26:29.860\nThe other one would be\nfind entire cell content.\n\n480\n00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:34.530\nFind entire cells only.\n\n481\n00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:35.030\nLet's change this.\n\n482\n00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:37.375\nLet's change this to cat, okay?\n\n483\n00:26:37.375 --> 00:26:40.920\nAnd I'm going to take this off cuz I can't\nremember if I had uppercase and lowercase.\n\n484\n00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:44.360\nIf I find next,\nlook at this one right here.\n\n485\n00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.590\nThat cell that is selected,\nI'm not sure if you can read it.\n\n486\n00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:49.700\nIt says is a big cat, okay?\n\n487\n00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.680\nIt found cat, didn't it?\n\n488\n00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:54.730\nIf I find the next one,\nit'll say Cattington.\n\n489\n00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:56.490\nOkay, that's what's in that\nparticular cell right there.\n\n490\n00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:01.900\nThere's cats, there's cats are cool,\nit's a big cat and back to the beginning.\n\n491\n00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:05.230\nSo, I think you might understand or maybe\nguess, what do you think that's gonna do?\n\n492\n00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:12.690\nIt's gonna find it only if that's\nthe whole cell, not part of a cell.\n\n493\n00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:15.030\nSo, then you get just that one.\n\n494\n00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:17.500\nAnd there is Sasha Cat.\n\n495\n00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:24.340\nHe was such a good boy, he was many\ngenerations but yes, he was a good boy.\n\n496\n00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:29.000\nAnd that's how you can use the find,\nnow this is where, if I wanted to go back,\n\n497\n00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.030\nlet me take this off,\ngo ahead and type in fuego and\n\n498\n00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:39.970\nI wanted to change the fuego, every\ninstance of fuego with the word firepants,\n\n499\n00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:44.560\nyou would go ahead and click replace and\nthen you have your replace.\n\n500\n00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.906\nAnd I could put in fire pants.\n\n501\n00:27:46.906 --> 00:27:51.901\nAnd then we can replace,\nyou find the next and\n\n502\n00:27:51.901 --> 00:27:56.117\nthen you can replace that single one.\n\n503\n00:27:56.117 --> 00:27:58.945\nFind the next, replace,\nfind the next, replace or\n\n504\n00:27:58.945 --> 00:28:01.590\nwhat do you think Replace All is gonna do?\n\n505\n00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:08.300\nExactly, replace all instances of fuego\nwith fire pants and then it goes through.\n\n506\n00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:11.650\nThis is the only one where we get an\nactual, hey, I did it, I went through and\n\n507\n00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:14.010\nmade four replacements.\n\n508\n00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:20.530\nAnd then here I believe there and\na couple other places.\n\n509\n00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:23.401\nThere's fire pants right there.\n\n510\n00:28:23.401 --> 00:28:25.750\nSo find and replace can be pretty cool.\n\n511\n00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:32.170\nI do use it quite frequently\nin all of my products.\n\n512\n00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:37.390\nSo, I believe that comes\nto the end of the line.\n\n513\n00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:43.400\nAnd that's how we can select\ncells cuz you need to select\n\n514\n00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:47.880\nbefore you can affect, so\nvery important part of any product.\n\n515\n00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:52.560\nYou got to make sure you know how\nto select your information and\n\n516\n00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:56.665\nnow that we've selected, just a preview\nof what we're gonna be doing next.\n\n517\n00:28:56.665 --> 00:29:00.565\nWe're going to actually be\nentering data into our cells.\n\n518\n00:29:00.565 --> 00:29:01.694\nWhew.\n&gt;&gt; I tell you what,\n\n519\n00:29:01.694 --> 00:29:05.233\nI did not think the select cells\ncould be possibly that complicated.\n\n520\n00:29:05.233 --> 00:29:06.121\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But,\n\n521\n00:29:06.121 --> 00:29:09.781\nyou did show me a couple of things that\nwould help me improve my productivity and\n\n522\n00:29:09.781 --> 00:29:12.472\nwell, I'm going to practice those here and\nthere.\n\n523\n00:29:12.472 --> 00:29:13.962\nDon't get overwhelmed by these,\n\n524\n00:29:13.962 --> 00:29:17.792\npick up small little bits that help you\nin your everyday workflows and well,\n\n525\n00:29:17.792 --> 00:29:20.032\nthey'll end up saving you\na lot of time in the long run.\n\n526\n00:29:20.032 --> 00:29:23.332\nAnd speaking of time, well, we're going to\ngo ahead and get out of here because we're\n\n527\n00:29:23.332 --> 00:29:27.332\nout of time, so signing off for OfficePro\nTV, I've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n528\n00:29:27.332 --> 00:29:28.222\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonn Smith.\n\n529\n00:29:28.222 --> 00:29:34.319\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

OFFICEPRO.TV,\n\n3\n00:00:15.528 --> 00:00:17.247\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and\n\n4\n00:00:17.247 --> 00:00:20.825\nwe're coming back at you with more\nExcel 2016 Essentials for Mac.\n\n5\n00:00:20.825 --> 00:00:24.670\nAnd well we're gonna be inserting data\nduring this episode and luckily we have\n\n6\n00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.241\nour very own data commander in the studio\nwith us today Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:28.241 --> 00:00:29.110\nHow you doing today Vonne?\n\n8\n00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.910\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, data commander, I like that title.\n\n9\n00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.892\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI escalated your rank on this episode.\n\n10\n00:00:33.892 --> 00:00:37.400\n&gt;&gt; Woohoo, [LAUGH] I'm feeling\ngood about that, so yeah,\n\n11\n00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.180\nwe are going to talk about well,\nhow do I put information into a cell?\n\n12\n00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.890\nYes, again, another very simple topic,\nbut there's always little nuances and\n\n13\n00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.441\nthat's what I'm here to show you and\ndifferent shortcuts and\n\n14\n00:00:50.441 --> 00:00:53.663\nmaybe just a different way of\napproaching how you do it.\n\n15\n00:00:53.663 --> 00:00:58.079\nSo, let's just jump right in okay, were\ngoing to come on in here, you know what\n\n16\n00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.252\nactually I forgot to startup Excel so\nwhy don't we come into our launch pads.\n\n17\n00:01:02.252 --> 00:01:06.511\nYou did call me the commander, so\nI want to fly my spaceship around and\n\n18\n00:01:06.511 --> 00:01:10.845\nlaunch off the pad and I'm, yeah,\nI'm trying to put things together\n\n19\n00:01:10.845 --> 00:01:13.797\nto make it a reason for\nme to go to the launch pad.\n\n20\n00:01:13.797 --> 00:01:17.307\nJust for fun let's go ahead and\nstart that up and we've got it,\n\n21\n00:01:17.307 --> 00:01:19.807\nwe're gonna start a blank\nnew workbook here.\n\n22\n00:01:19.807 --> 00:01:24.767\nSo, I will double click here, and\nI've got my cells, I am gonna zoom in on\n\n23\n00:01:24.767 --> 00:01:27.617\nthis a little bit so maybe it's a little\neasier for you all to see it out there.\n\n24\n00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.515\nHow do I enter text in a cell?\n\n25\n00:01:30.515 --> 00:01:35.040\n[LAUGH] You'd be amazed at how many\ndifferent ways you could do this.\n\n26\n00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.400\nIf I wanted to insert data in cell C4,\n\n27\n00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.250\nwell I need to get to cell C4 first,\nso that is step number one.\n\n28\n00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.180\nMake sure you select the cell that you\nwanna start putting information into\n\n29\n00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.160\nand now you just start typing.\n\n30\n00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.430\nThat's really the easiest way to do it,\nI don't have to get a flashing cursor,\n\n31\n00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.500\nI don't have to do anything, I can just\nstart typing and I can say, Hello World.\n\n32\n00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.470\nIsn't that the first thing we always do\nwhen we're doing code in here Justin?\n\n33\n00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah we typically do and\npeople are like well why do you do that?\n\n34\n00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.340\nWell it's kind of like a tradition.\n\n35\n00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We gotta have a victory somewhere and\n\n36\n00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.110\nstart with small successes so\nwe started with a small success here\n\n37\n00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.030\ni'm kind of interested to see how\nmany other ways can we do this.\n\n38\n00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right and wasn't there\nsomething like the first thing that\n\n39\n00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.990\nwas broadcast out across the Internet was,\nHello World, there's some-\n\n40\n00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.610\n&gt;&gt; There is something,\n\n41\n00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.800\nI don't remember the story right off\nhand but there is something like that.\n\n42\n00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would need to oogly\nGoogly that one and find out but\n\n43\n00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.050\nI feel there's some reason why that\nphrase is used when first start\n\n44\n00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.730\nyour coding or first thing you\never do in a particular program.\n\n45\n00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.301\nSo, maybe why don't you look\nthat up there for us, Justin?\n\n46\n00:02:46.301 --> 00:02:50.390\n[LAUGH] So yes, I just said,\nhow many other ways can we do this?\n\n47\n00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.930\nWell, first of all let's talk about,\nI'm done with this\n\n48\n00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.380\nI want to commit the changes that I\nhave created to this particular cell.\n\n49\n00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.450\n&gt;&gt; I just hit Enter,\n\n50\n00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.592\nbecause Enter in Excel means\nsomething different than in Word.\n\n51\n00:03:04.592 --> 00:03:08.690\nWord is you get another paragraph, here\nit's I'm just moving down remember Enter\n\n52\n00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.750\ntakes you one cell down and\nit commits the change you already did.\n\n53\n00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.150\nSo that's personally how I do it,\nyou could also, let me click over here and\n\n54\n00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.500\ntype in,\nHello Justin did I spell that right, yeah.\n\n55\n00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.030\nYeah.\nJustin, I could click off of this,\n\n56\n00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.670\ntake my mouse and click over here and\n\n57\n00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.150\nthen also commits that information\ninto that particular cell.\n\n58\n00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.960\nSo, that's why again I'm\njust gonna hit Enter, but\n\n59\n00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.480\nnow how else can I enter\nin information into a cell?\n\n60\n00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.400\nI'm going to click on,\nwhat is this, E6, the other way is\n\n61\n00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.450\ndouble clicking to get into the cell.\n\n62\n00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.520\nI think it's one extra step, honestly,\nthan just starting to type but\n\n63\n00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.730\nsome people feel better when\nthey see a flashing cursor\n\n64\n00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.160\ncuz a flashing cursor\nindicates that you can type.\n\n65\n00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.210\nSo that's one that way you can enter\ninto the cell, and then type in a hello\n\n66\n00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.820\nTitus and we will say,\nyep, Titus, there we go.\n\n67\n00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.658\nAnd I will hit Enter, and that's how\nyou could do it, so single click, type,\n\n68\n00:04:12.658 --> 00:04:18.540\ndouble click, type or\nyou can even do this.\n\n69\n00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:24.310\nYou could come over here and\nyou can come up onto the Formula Bar,\n\n70\n00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.970\nseems kinda far to go honestly but\nthere are reasons\n\n71\n00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.510\nwhy I use all of these different\ntechniques for different reasons.\n\n72\n00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.300\nEspecially when I get back into\nediting cells or cell content, so\n\n73\n00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.760\nonce I'm in the formula bar,\nI can say this is the formula,\n\n74\n00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.540\nokay, Formula Bar and\n\n75\n00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.560\nthen once I'm in the formula bar,\nI still just go ahead and hit Enter.\n\n76\n00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.670\nBut notice you do have these little Xs or\na checkmark to\n\n77\n00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.020\nenter or cancel the information\nthat you just put in.\n\n78\n00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.880\nI just go ahead and click the, I just,\nI don't ever really hit the green arrow or\n\n79\n00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.010\ngreen checkbox honestly but I wanted to\nshow you that that's how you could do it.\n\n80\n00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:14.150\nAnd there you go now the text lives\nin the cell that you type it into,\n\n81\n00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.150\nregardless if it goes past that cell.\n\n82\n00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.330\nFor example, right here, notice how\nit says, This is the formula bar,\n\n83\n00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.390\nit kinda looks like it's in column B and\nC, doesn't it?\n\n84\n00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:31.340\nWell, that's where the formula bar\nis very important to understand\n\n85\n00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.090\nwhat its functionality does for you,\nit's show's you what's in the cell.\n\n86\n00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.790\nBecause if I click right here, notice\nup here, there is no content in there\n\n87\n00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:45.230\nthe text does not live anywhere in\nthat cell it only lives in cell B9.\n\n88\n00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:52.480\nIn the formula bar, it's telling me this\nis the content of the cell even though,\n\n89\n00:05:52.480 --> 00:06:00.080\nit bleeds over into another column, okay,\nand the only reason you see it that way\n\n90\n00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.018\nright now is because there is nothing\nnext to that particular cell, B9.\n\n91\n00:06:05.018 --> 00:06:09.740\nIf there was text and I'll do it\nright now, if I select on cell C9\n\n92\n00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.660\nand type just text,\ndo you see how now the text\n\n93\n00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:21.750\nin cell B9 has been cut off\nbecause there's information there.\n\n94\n00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:27.040\nAnd that's what you need to know about\nwhere the text lives within cells.\n\n95\n00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.220\n&gt;&gt; Now this behavior, this is by default\nthe behavior that's in Excel because\n\n96\n00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.110\nmaybe I'm showing our hand a little bit.\n\n97\n00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.340\nThere is a way to change a little bit\nof this behavior or parts of it, but\n\n98\n00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.460\nthe default behavior is overflow\nunless there is adjacent content and\n\n99\n00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.890\nthen it is hidden for overflow, right.\n\n100\n00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:50.500\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and you're alluding\nto the width of the column,\n\n101\n00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.910\ncuz right now column B is only this wide.\n\n102\n00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:59.300\nIf I had text here, I should go to A and\nI just type a bunch of gobbledygook,\n\n103\n00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.470\nright, you see it goes all the way over\nbecause there's nothing over there.\n\n104\n00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.470\nEven though the width of\ncolumn A is only this wide,\n\n105\n00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.510\nit's still going to show because there's\nnothing else within that particular row.\n\n106\n00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:11.787\nSo yes, you can change column width but\n\n107\n00:07:11.787 --> 00:07:16.738\nwe'll go over that in modifying worksheet,\nbut you are correct, that's how it works.\n\n108\n00:07:16.738 --> 00:07:20.870\nNow what about editing the text, okay,\n\n109\n00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.310\nI would like to say I\nwant to change this from,\n\n110\n00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:30.554\nHello World, to, Goodbye Sun.\n\n111\n00:07:30.554 --> 00:07:35.230\nHow do I change that all right\nif I want to completely replace\n\n112\n00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:39.970\nthe content that's in that cell if\nI single click it and start typing\n\n113\n00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:43.090\nI'm gonna remove anything that's\nalready in there and then type over it.\n\n114\n00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:46.694\nSo I will say Goodbye Sun, hit Enter,\n\n115\n00:07:46.694 --> 00:07:51.662\nthere we go I have replaced\nthe content of that cell.\n\n116\n00:07:51.662 --> 00:07:56.618\nBut what if I wanted to say, instead of\nHello Justin I wanna say Hello World,\n\n117\n00:07:56.618 --> 00:07:59.807\nright, I don't wanna\ntake the whole thing out.\n\n118\n00:07:59.807 --> 00:08:01.519\nSo how do I do that?\n\n119\n00:08:01.519 --> 00:08:03.088\nCouple different ways.\n\n120\n00:08:03.088 --> 00:08:06.093\nI'm gonna single click\njust to activate it.\n\n121\n00:08:06.093 --> 00:08:09.873\nIf you double click on it,\nwhen you double click,\n\n122\n00:08:09.873 --> 00:08:14.202\nget your flashing cursor and\nthen I can use my arrow keys.\n\n123\n00:08:14.202 --> 00:08:18.837\nI could also click hold and drag because\nnow I'm working in that cell and\n\n124\n00:08:18.837 --> 00:08:21.476\nusing the text as text within that cell.\n\n125\n00:08:21.476 --> 00:08:26.417\nSo I can select the word just,\nand then type in, World,\n\n126\n00:08:26.417 --> 00:08:29.584\nand now I have World and I hit Enter.\n\n127\n00:08:29.584 --> 00:08:32.551\nAny searching in there?\n\n128\n00:08:32.551 --> 00:08:34.314\nDid you find anything\nabout that Hello World?\n\n129\n00:08:34.314 --> 00:08:38.311\n&gt;&gt; I know the story you're talking about,\nbut I'm not sure it's Hello World.\n\n130\n00:08:38.311 --> 00:08:42.527\nApparently, Hello World originated\nduring the Development, notes for\n\n131\n00:08:42.527 --> 00:08:47.491\nthe B programming language, which isn't\neven around anymore, as like Bell Labs, or\n\n132\n00:08:47.491 --> 00:08:48.249\nsomething.\n\n133\n00:08:48.249 --> 00:08:48.865\n&gt;&gt; B?\n\n134\n00:08:48.865 --> 00:08:49.809\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, B.\n&gt;&gt; Not C?\n\n135\n00:08:49.809 --> 00:08:53.811\n&gt;&gt; Not C, B came before C and then B went\naway and C has kinda been hanging out.\n\n136\n00:08:53.811 --> 00:08:56.751\nNice little trivia for everyone but\nit wasn't a broadcast.\n\n137\n00:08:56.751 --> 00:08:59.683\nBut there is a story like that but\nI wasn't able to find it.\n\n138\n00:08:59.683 --> 00:09:04.820\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but it does equate back\nto programming languages and\n\n139\n00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:11.612\nwhat somebody outputted onto the screen\nin B, not C, all right, I like that.\n\n140\n00:09:11.612 --> 00:09:13.004\nThank you, Internet.\n\n141\n00:09:13.004 --> 00:09:16.548\n[LAUGH] And thank you Justin, okay?\n\n142\n00:09:16.548 --> 00:09:18.425\nAnd I replaced it, you know what?\n\n143\n00:09:18.425 --> 00:09:21.731\nI'm gonna go back and change that\nHello World to Hello Justin, and\n\n144\n00:09:21.731 --> 00:09:24.462\nshow you another way to change\nthe content of the cell.\n\n145\n00:09:24.462 --> 00:09:28.907\nI can select this and just like before,\nI can come up into the formula bar.\n\n146\n00:09:28.907 --> 00:09:33.617\nSo if I wanted to come up here and\nthen click into the formula bar,\n\n147\n00:09:33.617 --> 00:09:39.125\nget rid of that, type in Justin,\nhit Enter, and then I've changed that.\n\n148\n00:09:39.125 --> 00:09:46.351\nAll different ways, but I will tell you\nmy favorite one that I use all the time.\n\n149\n00:09:46.351 --> 00:09:50.681\nI have to remind myself of\nwhat it is on a Mac keyboard\n\n150\n00:09:50.681 --> 00:09:55.433\nshortcut because I'm so\nused to the PC one, it's F2.\n\n151\n00:09:55.433 --> 00:09:58.114\nF2 is my favorite\nshortcut to rename stuff.\n\n152\n00:09:58.114 --> 00:10:00.307\nIt doesn't work on a Mac though, okay?\n\n153\n00:10:00.307 --> 00:10:04.774\nMeaning if I click here, especially\nif I use keyboard, think about this.\n\n154\n00:10:04.774 --> 00:10:08.140\nI'm using my keyboard, I'm using my,\nup and down arrows and\n\n155\n00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:12.183\nI want to come right here and I want\nto change this, maybe change this one.\n\n156\n00:10:12.183 --> 00:10:15.903\nBut I don't wanna have to take my hands\noff of the keyboard, and put it on to\n\n157\n00:10:15.903 --> 00:10:20.115\nthe mouse, double click it, and I don't\nwant to have to take the word Goodbye out.\n\n158\n00:10:20.115 --> 00:10:22.875\nCan I just get the flashing cursor,\ncan I activate the cursor into that cell?\n\n159\n00:10:22.875 --> 00:10:28.770\nYou can, it's Ctrl, not Cmd, Ctrl+U.\n\n160\n00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:32.043\nCtrl + U, this is very hard to see,\nbut you see if I use my arrow keys,\n\n161\n00:10:32.043 --> 00:10:35.825\nI just activated the character into that\ncell without having to take my hands off\n\n162\n00:10:35.825 --> 00:10:36.574\nthe keyboard.\n\n163\n00:10:36.574 --> 00:10:39.530\nLove that one, it is not Cmd + U.\n\n164\n00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:42.010\nThe Cmd+U is underline,\nokay, so it is Ctrl.\n\n165\n00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:45.978\nSo then I can say, well, I guess I should.\n\n166\n00:10:45.978 --> 00:10:48.940\n[LAUGH] Goodbye Justin.\n\n167\n00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:49.719\nDon't leave, stay right there.\n\n168\n00:10:49.719 --> 00:10:54.364\nOkay, but\nthat is where I can activate the cursor,\n\n169\n00:10:54.364 --> 00:10:58.810\nlove that shortcut Cmd,\nsorry Ctrl+U, neat.\n\n170\n00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:02.020\nNow, when I am inserting information,\nremember we talked about\n\n171\n00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:06.660\nin the navigation, we talked about\nthe Tab and the Enter, right?\n\n172\n00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.080\nBecause that's really\ngood if I'm over here,\n\n173\n00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:13.510\nlet's just say in D10, maybe we'll go E10.\n\n174\n00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:15.470\nAnd I want to type across and\n\n175\n00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:20.450\nthen down, using the Tab and\nEnter is a really good way for data entry.\n\n176\n00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.471\nIf I typed in, let's say,\nI'm gonna zoom in a little bit.\n\n177\n00:11:23.471 --> 00:11:28.112\nIf I typed in First, Tab, Last, Tab,\n\n178\n00:11:28.112 --> 00:11:31.773\nDepartment, hitting Enter,\n\n179\n00:11:31.773 --> 00:11:36.154\n[SOUND] puts me backs to the next line.\n\n180\n00:11:36.154 --> 00:11:42.397\nAnd then I can say Vonne, Tab,\nSmith, Tab, and then Host,\n\n181\n00:11:42.397 --> 00:11:50.290\nEnter, and then you can see I can keep\non going, and I can keep on going.\n\n182\n00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:53.920\nSo you can see that if I just\nkeep on using those Tabs and\n\n183\n00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.290\nEnters, it's really cool for data entry.\n\n184\n00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.510\nThat's if you don't have\nanything selected first.\n\n185\n00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.240\nWatch if I do this.\n\n186\n00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:06.210\nIf I select these cells, and then I type,\n\n187\n00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:11.470\nand I say, Justin, Tab, Dennison, yes?\n\n188\n00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:13.570\n&gt;&gt; You got it Vonne, bravo.\n\n189\n00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.850\nThey usually leave out that\nextra n in the last name.\n\n190\n00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:18.368\n&gt;&gt; Okay, because they always\nleave out the two n's in my name.\n\n191\n00:12:18.368 --> 00:12:20.628\nYou'd be surprised at how\npeople spell my name.\n\n192\n00:12:20.628 --> 00:12:26.210\nBut I'm not gonna hit Enter, if I hit the\nTab, you see it just cycles me through.\n\n193\n00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:31.320\nBecause I selected the cells first and\nthat way I just blah,\n\n194\n00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.760\nblah, blah, Tab, Tab, Tab.\n\n195\n00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:38.160\nAnd now, actually look,\nI just actually cycled myself.\n\n196\n00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.010\nSo that's another thing.\n\n197\n00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:43.885\nIf you know you have to just kind of\nquickly type things in, select and\n\n198\n00:12:43.885 --> 00:12:48.675\njust use your tab or use your Tab and\nyour Enters to do the whole return\n\n199\n00:12:48.675 --> 00:12:52.590\nback to the starting line\nfrom where you first tabbed.\n\n200\n00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:55.830\nKinda neat, pretty cool in that.\n\n201\n00:12:55.830 --> 00:13:01.080\nNow, when we have the,\nokay, yes, we have this.\n\n202\n00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.490\nWe talked about the text and the overflow.\n\n203\n00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.272\nSorry, I was looking back at my notes and\n\n204\n00:13:04.272 --> 00:13:07.016\nI just realized I don't know\nwhy I wrote that [LAUGH].\n\n205\n00:13:07.016 --> 00:13:11.070\nFormat to fix,\nI thought I typed in formula.\n\n206\n00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:14.857\nI'm like, why would I need a formula\nto fix those, no, okay, that's why.\n\n207\n00:13:14.857 --> 00:13:19.250\n[LAUGH] You should always double check,\nyes, with the com.\n\n208\n00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:22.400\nWe already alluded to that is\nthat if I typed in something,\n\n209\n00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:26.210\nnotice nothing lives in B13, and\nI type, everything gets cut off.\n\n210\n00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:29.243\nMight as well just show you really quick,\nbecause you`re like, just show me.\n\n211\n00:13:29.243 --> 00:13:32.720\nOkay, the easiest way to change\nyour column width really quickly,\n\n212\n00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.900\nis to come up in between your\ncolumns between, your A and B.\n\n213\n00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:39.660\nAnd if you double click it will come here,\nthere.\n\n214\n00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:43.730\nIt will automatically resize\nyour column to the largest width\n\n215\n00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.630\nof the information within that column.\n\n216\n00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:47.600\nSo really fun, auto fit your columns.\n\n217\n00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.220\nAnd that would be how you can format or\n\n218\n00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:54.590\nmodify your worksheet to be able to\ndisplay text that's overflowing and\n\n219\n00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:56.290\ngetting cut off by the next\ntext in the next cell.\n\n220\n00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:00.206\n&gt;&gt; Now, I will say you have to be careful\nwith that because sometimes you don't\n\n221\n00:14:00.206 --> 00:14:02.320\nanticipate that something's\ngoing to be as long as it is.\n\n222\n00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.112\nAnd then you have a column\nthat's like a page wide and\n\n223\n00:14:05.112 --> 00:14:08.430\nyou go, that's not what I want,\nso just be careful there.\n\n224\n00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:11.370\nBut I noticed when you were typing a few\nthings, especially while you were raking\n\n225\n00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:16.700\nyour hand across the keyboard,\nit was like bluish letters appearing.\n\n226\n00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.080\nAnd what is that all about Vonne?\n\n227\n00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.594\n&gt;&gt; Good eyes, yes,\nhere I'm just gonna move over and\n\n228\n00:14:21.594 --> 00:14:25.623\nwe're gonna start anew, so\nI can show you what I've got.\n\n229\n00:14:25.623 --> 00:14:29.970\nI love this one, okay, we're going\nto type in, let's type in Vonne.\n\n230\n00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:32.093\nAnd then we'll type in Justin.\n\n231\n00:14:32.093 --> 00:14:33.676\nAnd we'll type in Titus.\n\n232\n00:14:33.676 --> 00:14:41.910\nCuz maybe we're assigning who gets\na cookie when and what have you.\n\n233\n00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:45.154\nNotice the theme in these episodes with\nthis color shirt, it's all about cookies.\n\n234\n00:14:45.154 --> 00:14:49.340\nBut then now I want to\nassign a cookie to myself.\n\n235\n00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:51.490\nI've already got some\ninformation in your column.\n\n236\n00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:54.427\nIf I start typing the letter V,\ndid you see that?\n\n237\n00:14:54.427 --> 00:14:55.626\nIs that what you're talking about?\n\n238\n00:14:55.626 --> 00:14:58.387\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthose are the blue highlighted letters and\n\n239\n00:14:58.387 --> 00:15:00.760\nI was like, they're going by too fast.\n\n240\n00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.634\nBut this is just giving you a suggestion.\n\n241\n00:15:02.634 --> 00:15:07.987\n&gt;&gt; It's seeing the data that's already\nin your column and it is saying,\n\n242\n00:15:07.987 --> 00:15:12.490\nlet me try to give you suggestions and\nauto complete for you.\n\n243\n00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:13.580\nAnd this is awesome.\n\n244\n00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:14.930\nAll I have to say, yep, I'm done.\n\n245\n00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:15.879\nYou hit Enter and there you go.\n\n246\n00:15:15.879 --> 00:15:19.650\nIf I started in the letter T,\nyep, that's for Titus.\n\n247\n00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:23.970\nAnd then when you go there, the thing is,\n\n248\n00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:29.039\nwhat if I have J-U and\nmaybe I need Justinarina.\n\n249\n00:15:29.039 --> 00:15:31.265\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n250\n00:15:31.265 --> 00:15:33.971\n&gt;&gt; So you notice how if I just keep\n\n251\n00:15:33.971 --> 00:15:36.420\ntyping, it will be okay.\n\n252\n00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:39.996\nIf I set like T-I-M-O-T-H-Y,\n\n253\n00:15:39.996 --> 00:15:45.543\nit's okay if I know that's\nnot what I want, keep going.\n\n254\n00:15:45.543 --> 00:15:49.363\nBut the neat thing is now,\nwatch when I do this again.\n\n255\n00:15:49.363 --> 00:15:53.666\nIf I start typing in J, it gives me,\nI don't know if you can see that,\n\n256\n00:15:53.666 --> 00:15:56.128\nit gives me a little drop down list now.\n\n257\n00:15:56.128 --> 00:16:00.597\nSo it's now remembering, did you want\nJustin, or did you want Justiana?\n\n258\n00:16:00.597 --> 00:16:02.835\nYeah, or it's Justiana, okay?\n\n259\n00:16:02.835 --> 00:16:05.313\nWell notice here if,\noops, I tabbed, sorry.\n\n260\n00:16:05.313 --> 00:16:06.277\nLet me go ahead and start that again.\n\n261\n00:16:06.277 --> 00:16:11.645\nNotice with my keyboard, if I hit my\nDown arrow key, I can then say nope,\n\n262\n00:16:11.645 --> 00:16:17.811\nI want Justiana, and then if I hit Tab or\nEnter, it will then go ahead and populate.\n\n263\n00:16:17.811 --> 00:16:22.381\nSo think about it, if you have data that\nyou maybe have 16 different things, and\n\n264\n00:16:22.381 --> 00:16:26.501\nyou keep on typing it will remember that,\nthat's really, really neat.\n\n265\n00:16:26.501 --> 00:16:28.977\nSo, same thing with the Titus and\nthe Timothy noun.\n\n266\n00:16:28.977 --> 00:16:34.204\nOr if I just hit Enter, notice I did not\npick one, it just typed in the letter T.\n\n267\n00:16:34.204 --> 00:16:37.878\nSo you do have to kinda get in a,\nnope, that's where I want Titus.\n\n268\n00:16:37.878 --> 00:16:40.362\nSo you have to remember to select it.\n\n269\n00:16:40.362 --> 00:16:44.510\nAnd especially if you're already doing\nkeyboard, I use my Down arrow keys, and\n\n270\n00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:46.655\nthen my Enter or my tabs to complete that.\n\n271\n00:16:46.655 --> 00:16:48.951\n&gt;&gt; Now,\nyou said this is within the same column.\n\n272\n00:16:48.951 --> 00:16:52.253\nIs this within the same column, or\nis this within the same worksheet?\n\n273\n00:16:52.253 --> 00:16:54.992\nSo can I go over to K2 and\nstart typing Justin,\n\n274\n00:16:54.992 --> 00:16:57.599\nwill it give me those two recommendations?\n\n275\n00:16:57.599 --> 00:17:02.406\n&gt;&gt; No, see, as soon as I start,\nit's seeing it by column.\n\n276\n00:17:02.406 --> 00:17:04.061\n&gt;&gt; So I would have to start over.\n\n277\n00:17:04.061 --> 00:17:08.348\nBut now, as soon as I type in one,\nthen it will start remembering.\n\n278\n00:17:08.348 --> 00:17:12.650\nAnd it also looks at it here,\nlook, it's gotta be contiguous.\n\n279\n00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:13.497\nDo you see?\n\n280\n00:17:13.497 --> 00:17:14.335\nIt's not remembering.\n\n281\n00:17:14.335 --> 00:17:17.903\nAnd if I come down here and\nsay start typing,\n\n282\n00:17:17.903 --> 00:17:21.772\nsee it's not giving me\nany other remembrance.\n\n283\n00:17:21.772 --> 00:17:24.706\nBut if I came to this cell,\nthen it's gonna see it.\n\n284\n00:17:24.706 --> 00:17:28.101\nSo it does have parameters,\nI guess you could say of when it's\n\n285\n00:17:28.101 --> 00:17:32.363\ngonna give you those suggestions for\nthe AutoComplete, and when it's not.\n\n286\n00:17:32.363 --> 00:17:36.473\nColumns and contiguous, so\nthat's the biggest one.\n\n287\n00:17:36.473 --> 00:17:37.056\nGood question though.\n\n288\n00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:42.412\nNow, you do have a few other things of how\nyou enter data and what it will do for\n\n289\n00:17:42.412 --> 00:17:46.708\nyour AutoCorrect, not complete,\nthat was AutoComplete.\n\n290\n00:17:46.708 --> 00:17:49.800\nAutoCorrect is like,\n[LAUGH] you know about AutoCorrect.\n\n291\n00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.200\n[LAUGH] If it's the one where it's when\nyou don't want it to AutoCorrect, and\n\n292\n00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.512\nyou're like ooh,\nthat's not what I want it to say.\n\n293\n00:17:55.512 --> 00:17:59.667\nSo here, these are things like\nautomatically changing the spelling or\n\n294\n00:17:59.667 --> 00:18:02.991\ncorrecting your spelling when\nyou have a mistyped word,\n\n295\n00:18:02.991 --> 00:18:06.888\nautomatically capitalizing your\nfirst words of your sentences.\n\n296\n00:18:06.888 --> 00:18:09.654\nThis is in a lot of things we\ntalk about in the Word episode.\n\n297\n00:18:09.654 --> 00:18:11.269\nSo if you wanna check that one out,\n\n298\n00:18:11.269 --> 00:18:13.794\nthey're a little bit more\nextensive that we go over.\n\n299\n00:18:13.794 --> 00:18:19.559\nSo for example, if I started typing\nin on this cell a lowercase i.\n\n300\n00:18:19.559 --> 00:18:22.481\nAnd then space, watch what's gonna happen.\n\n301\n00:18:22.481 --> 00:18:25.519\nSee how it automatically capitalized that?\n\n302\n00:18:25.519 --> 00:18:29.643\nAnd let's say, I can't, right?\n\n303\n00:18:29.643 --> 00:18:33.622\nC-A-N-T, space.\n\n304\n00:18:33.622 --> 00:18:36.069\nWell of course, thank you for\n[INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH].\n\n305\n00:18:36.069 --> 00:18:39.407\nIt's supposed to put\nthe apostrophe in there, but\n\n306\n00:18:39.407 --> 00:18:42.987\nit will find words like,\nlet's see if I can remember.\n\n307\n00:18:42.987 --> 00:18:47.722\n[LAUGH] I'm trying to find\nwords that it's going to flip.\n\n308\n00:18:47.722 --> 00:18:50.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI think a common transposition is the,\n\n309\n00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:52.067\nT-E-H-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n310\n00:18:52.067 --> 00:18:53.030\n&gt;&gt; Instead of T-H-E.\n\n311\n00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:58.786\n&gt;&gt; Let's do that H,T, E, there, okay, THE.\n\n312\n00:18:58.786 --> 00:18:59.409\nThat's what I'm trying to do.\n\n313\n00:18:59.409 --> 00:19:04.615\nThere will be certain words that it\nwill flip, it'll capitalize the I.\n\n314\n00:19:04.615 --> 00:19:07.553\nIt will do a lot of those transposing.\n\n315\n00:19:07.553 --> 00:19:10.730\nI can't remember the sentence\nI usually type in in Word,\n\n316\n00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:15.245\nbut can't, like putting the apostrophe\nin it, is one that I always try to show.\n\n317\n00:19:15.245 --> 00:19:18.047\nAnd it obviously just went ahead and\nbackfired on me on that one.\n\n318\n00:19:18.047 --> 00:19:23.368\nBut, you do have that and you won't have,\nlike, notice how if I come back to here.\n\n319\n00:19:23.368 --> 00:19:25.797\nYou don't get the little smart\ntags like you get in Word.\n\n320\n00:19:25.797 --> 00:19:28.485\nLike whew, I did a correction for\nyou, are sure you wanted to do this?\n\n321\n00:19:28.485 --> 00:19:30.627\nIt's not a word processing program.\n\n322\n00:19:30.627 --> 00:19:32.136\nThis is a spreadsheet application.\n\n323\n00:19:32.136 --> 00:19:37.565\nSo it doesn't do the extent of those\nthings in this particular product.\n\n324\n00:19:37.565 --> 00:19:40.732\nBut you do have it, so\njust be aware of it.\n\n325\n00:19:40.732 --> 00:19:44.901\nAnd if you go into your\nExcel preferences in your,\n\n326\n00:19:44.901 --> 00:19:50.377\nhave to remember it's,\nright there, in the AutoCorrect.\n\n327\n00:19:50.377 --> 00:19:55.245\nNotice it does have a capitalize, names\nof the day, the two initial capitals,\n\n328\n00:19:55.245 --> 00:19:58.383\nfirst letters,\nall of these things are turned on.\n\n329\n00:19:58.383 --> 00:20:03.119\nSo you could turn these off if it's like,\ncuz maybe you're\n\n330\n00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:07.963\nalways doing I as a value within\nyour particular worksheet.\n\n331\n00:20:07.963 --> 00:20:09.714\nYou want it to stop doing that.\n\n332\n00:20:09.714 --> 00:20:11.120\nYou can tell it to.\n\n333\n00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.947\nNotice all these things,\n\n334\n00:20:12.947 --> 00:20:16.614\nsee here's some of the ones\nthat it's showing you actually.\n\n335\n00:20:16.614 --> 00:20:19.616\nLike if you typed it in this way,\nit's gonna show it that way.\n\n336\n00:20:19.616 --> 00:20:24.579\nSo it has a list that it's finding\nwhat commonly misspelled words and\n\n337\n00:20:24.579 --> 00:20:27.843\nhow it will go ahead and\ncorrect them for you.\n\n338\n00:20:27.843 --> 00:20:30.871\nSo you can also add and replace that.\n\n339\n00:20:30.871 --> 00:20:32.353\nYou can add your own.\n\n340\n00:20:32.353 --> 00:20:35.489\nLike if I'm always typing it this way or\ntake this one and\n\n341\n00:20:35.489 --> 00:20:39.897\nactually delete it because maybe HTE is\nsomething that you have in your company\n\n342\n00:20:39.897 --> 00:20:43.269\nthat you're always typing it in and\nit always corrects it.\n\n343\n00:20:43.269 --> 00:20:47.707\nYou can tell it, you can find it,\ntake it out of its memory and\n\n344\n00:20:47.707 --> 00:20:50.858\nthen it won't keep auto-correcting it.\n\n345\n00:20:50.858 --> 00:20:55.639\nNow if I do take it out of the memory,\nis that persistent across all of my Excel\n\n346\n00:20:55.639 --> 00:20:58.802\ndocuments now, or\nis it just for that worksheet?\n\n347\n00:20:58.802 --> 00:21:01.804\n&gt;&gt; Assuming he's gonna say something,\n\n348\n00:21:01.804 --> 00:21:04.770\nI'm not totally sure [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n349\n00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:06.650\n&gt;&gt; It is a preference, and\n\n350\n00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:12.109\nit's an Excel preference, so\nI'm gonna go with the whole program.\n\n351\n00:21:12.109 --> 00:21:13.594\nDon't quote me on that one, and\n\n352\n00:21:13.594 --> 00:21:16.186\nif it doesn't then I'm giving\nmyself an out right now.\n\n353\n00:21:16.186 --> 00:21:16.795\n[LAUGH] But\n\n354\n00:21:16.795 --> 00:21:22.132\nI'm going to assume since we're talking\nabout Excel preferences it will do that.\n\n355\n00:21:22.132 --> 00:21:24.219\nIt could be workbook specific.\n\n356\n00:21:24.219 --> 00:21:27.209\nI would have to test that out honestly.\n\n357\n00:21:27.209 --> 00:21:31.211\nAnd so If you all want to test\nit,you test it out and let me know.\n\n358\n00:21:31.211 --> 00:21:33.030\nvonne@itpro.tv.\n\n359\n00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:37.560\n[LAUGH] Cool, but very good question and\nI would definitely have to test that.\n\n360\n00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:40.851\nAll right,\nwhat else do we have on my notes?\n\n361\n00:21:40.851 --> 00:21:42.975\nRemove cell information.\n\n362\n00:21:42.975 --> 00:21:46.611\nNow this isn't necessarily inserting\ninformation bu it does happen\n\n363\n00:21:46.611 --> 00:21:47.619\nfrom time to time.\n\n364\n00:21:47.619 --> 00:21:54.382\nMaybe I needed to have Hello Titus,\nthat needed to be in cell A1.\n\n365\n00:21:54.382 --> 00:21:57.781\nHad to put him to the toppest, right?\n\n366\n00:21:57.781 --> 00:22:02.353\nIf I selected,\nhave it activated, get the hand.\n\n367\n00:22:02.353 --> 00:22:04.110\nDo you see how it's\nregistering much better now?\n\n368\n00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:06.196\nRemember in our other episode it was off?\n\n369\n00:22:06.196 --> 00:22:07.808\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n370\n00:22:07.808 --> 00:22:10.846\n&gt;&gt; That's just odd why that's\njust kinda fixing itself.\n\n371\n00:22:10.846 --> 00:22:11.722\nTechnology.\n\n372\n00:22:11.722 --> 00:22:14.859\n&gt;&gt; I think when we do those zooms,\nwhen I'm zooming in and\n\n373\n00:22:14.859 --> 00:22:18.693\ndoing like the control zoom, or\nit's part of the accessibility.\n\n374\n00:22:18.693 --> 00:22:22.007\nI wonder if it gets a little\nwonky when I do that.\n\n375\n00:22:22.007 --> 00:22:23.131\nNo?\n[LAUGH]\n\n376\n00:22:23.131 --> 00:22:23.975\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm just saying.\n\n377\n00:22:23.975 --> 00:22:26.970\nMaybe I'm like it's gonna bother me.\n\n378\n00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:30.985\nKeep me up at night, Vonne, so thanks.\n\n379\n00:22:30.985 --> 00:22:31.951\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You're welcome.\n\n380\n00:22:31.951 --> 00:22:34.767\n[LAUGH] And hey,\nget back to me with that answer.\n\n381\n00:22:34.767 --> 00:22:35.938\nThat'd be lovely, thanks.\n\n382\n00:22:35.938 --> 00:22:41.639\nAll right, so you can see that if\nI get the hand I can then click,\n\n383\n00:22:41.639 --> 00:22:46.496\nhold and drag, and\nI can move it, oops, over there.\n\n384\n00:22:46.496 --> 00:22:50.097\n[LAUGH] Yep, cuz I like to move it,\nmove it, right?\n\n385\n00:22:50.097 --> 00:22:52.754\nAll right, so\nlet's do that with Goodbye Justin.\n\n386\n00:22:52.754 --> 00:22:55.936\nWe can take our hand cuz\nyou gotta select first and\n\n387\n00:22:55.936 --> 00:22:59.434\nthen move it because I need\nto kinda change it around.\n\n388\n00:22:59.434 --> 00:23:02.602\nIt is, if you wanna say,\nit's a way of inserting information and\n\n389\n00:23:02.602 --> 00:23:04.109\njust put it in the wrong place.\n\n390\n00:23:04.109 --> 00:23:12.358\nI'm gonna do a little foreshadowing here\nbecause now we've seen how we can type.\n\n391\n00:23:12.358 --> 00:23:13.796\nYou click, you type.\n\n392\n00:23:13.796 --> 00:23:19.562\nSo we're not gonna spend more minutes of\nfiguring out how I can actually type and\n\n393\n00:23:19.562 --> 00:23:21.552\nreally type incorrectly.\n\n394\n00:23:21.552 --> 00:23:22.997\nGetting into copying and\n\n395\n00:23:22.997 --> 00:23:27.891\npasting, since I've already done the drag\nI have a whole episode about copy paste.\n\n396\n00:23:27.891 --> 00:23:29.074\nLike, really, a whole episode?\n\n397\n00:23:29.074 --> 00:23:32.135\nYeah, [LAUGH] especially in Excel.\n\n398\n00:23:32.135 --> 00:23:37.003\nBut with the move, if you take\nthe hand with the selected cell and\n\n399\n00:23:37.003 --> 00:23:42.519\nthen you hold your Option key or\nyour Alt key, it's gonna be hard to see.\n\n400\n00:23:42.519 --> 00:23:44.758\nAnd I don't wanna scroll in so\nyou can see it, but\n\n401\n00:23:44.758 --> 00:23:46.844\nthere's a little plus\nsign on top of my hand.\n\n402\n00:23:46.844 --> 00:23:49.819\nThere's also the kind that's key,\ncuz it's grabbing it.\n\n403\n00:23:49.819 --> 00:23:55.037\nIf I hold Alt and then drag,\nI'm actually making a copy.\n\n404\n00:23:55.037 --> 00:24:03.197\n[LAUGH] Alt-drag in Mac in\ngeneral is always duplicate.\n\n405\n00:24:03.197 --> 00:24:07.567\nIf you have, if I Alt-drag a selected\nfile, I make a copy of it.\n\n406\n00:24:07.567 --> 00:24:11.893\nAlt-drag is also a very common thing\nin all of your graphical products too,\n\n407\n00:24:11.893 --> 00:24:12.647\nlike Adobe.\n\n408\n00:24:12.647 --> 00:24:14.412\nIt's always duplicated.\n\n409\n00:24:14.412 --> 00:24:15.314\nIt's always make a copy.\n\n410\n00:24:15.314 --> 00:24:17.650\nSo it comes into here.\n\n411\n00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:24.027\nAnd in PC land, in case you're wondering,\nthat's Ctrl+move.\n\n412\n00:24:24.027 --> 00:24:25.832\nCtrl+drag will go ahead and do that.\n\n413\n00:24:25.832 --> 00:24:27.730\nSo that's kind of a fun little thing.\n\n414\n00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:33.717\nThere's also like you can also like\ntake this and sorry, Ctrl, stop.\n\n415\n00:24:33.717 --> 00:24:36.017\n[LAUGH] There, got to get the hand first.\n\n416\n00:24:36.017 --> 00:24:40.266\nIf you right-click Drag, then it gives you\na menu that you could say either copy,\n\n417\n00:24:40.266 --> 00:24:42.127\nmove, do all that kinda fun stuff.\n\n418\n00:24:42.127 --> 00:24:46.853\nYou can also hold the Control key and\ndrag, does the same thing.\n\n419\n00:24:46.853 --> 00:24:52.091\nBut Alt drag, or Option drag is\nkinda one of my favorite fun little\n\n420\n00:24:52.091 --> 00:24:57.057\nshortcuts for doing copying and\nmoving all together at once.\n\n421\n00:24:57.057 --> 00:24:59.025\nOkay, a little foreshadow.\n\n422\n00:24:59.025 --> 00:25:02.896\nBut if I can insert data,\nI can also delete data.\n\n423\n00:25:02.896 --> 00:25:06.688\nNow right now, we don't have any\nformatting going on right now.\n\n424\n00:25:06.688 --> 00:25:11.704\nAll we've done is just kinda plain\ntext if you wanna say into our cells.\n\n425\n00:25:11.704 --> 00:25:15.599\nSo if I wanted to get rid\nof that data in that cell,\n\n426\n00:25:15.599 --> 00:25:20.446\nall I have to do is select it Hit\nthe Delete key on my keyboard.\n\n427\n00:25:20.446 --> 00:25:21.567\nPoof, clears it out.\n\n428\n00:25:21.567 --> 00:25:23.513\nYou wanna take out all of this?\n\n429\n00:25:23.513 --> 00:25:26.594\nSelect it, hit the delete key.\n\n430\n00:25:26.594 --> 00:25:28.058\nGets rid of it.\n\n431\n00:25:28.058 --> 00:25:34.488\nNotice I'm emphasizing the fact that\nthis is plain text, no formatting.\n\n432\n00:25:34.488 --> 00:25:39.212\nCuz when you get in to formatting\nit acts a little differently but\n\n433\n00:25:39.212 --> 00:25:42.724\nif I wanted to select and\ndelete you can do that.\n\n434\n00:25:42.724 --> 00:25:45.547\nSo I believe that comes\nthe end of my notes so\n\n435\n00:25:45.547 --> 00:25:48.459\nthat's different ways we can insert data.\n\n436\n00:25:48.459 --> 00:25:52.854\nCopying and pasting is coming up\nnext cuz there's a lot of things,\n\n437\n00:25:52.854 --> 00:25:55.757\nthere's a lot of gotcha's\non that one too so\n\n438\n00:25:55.757 --> 00:26:00.640\nthat's why I wanted to dedicate it to\none whole episode within this show.\n\n439\n00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.354\n&gt;&gt; All right, well thank you so\nmuch, data commander for\n\n440\n00:26:03.354 --> 00:26:07.313\nlaunching us into the Excel universe,\nbut our adventures are just beginning.\n\n441\n00:26:07.313 --> 00:26:09.729\nWe got a lot more coming at you so\ndefinitely stay tuned, but for\n\n442\n00:26:09.729 --> 00:26:11.471\nnow we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n443\n00:26:11.471 --> 00:26:14.614\nSo, signing off for Office Pro TV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n444\n00:26:14.614 --> 00:26:15.421\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n445\n00:26:15.421 --> 00:26:16.489\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n446\n00:26:16.489 --> 00:26:22.889\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

OFFICEPRO.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.386 --> 00:00:17.141\nI'm your host Justin Dennison.\n\n4\n00:00:17.141 --> 00:00:18.220\nAnd well you asked for\n\n5\n00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.460\nit, we're gonna bring it back to\nyou more Excel 2016 essential for\n\n6\n00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.720\nMac and what we're gonna be talking\nabout cut, copy, paste in this episode.\n\n7\n00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.680\nAnd it may seem like one of those topics\nwhere you're like I don't know Justin,\n\n8\n00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.480\nit doesn't seem like it needs explanation.\n\n9\n00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.700\nWell, I know someone whose here\nwho is gonna prove you wrong.\n\n10\n00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.640\nThe one, the only Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n11\n00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.550\nHow you doing today Vonne?\n\n12\n00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.687\n&gt;&gt; That was a great introduction,\n[LAUGH] and\n\n13\n00:00:40.687 --> 00:00:43.410\nit just says everything\nthat I wanted to say yeah.\n\n14\n00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.828\nThis is a very ubiquitous thing\nthat happens in computer land.\n\n15\n00:00:47.828 --> 00:00:53.250\nAnd cut, copy, and paste, so\nreally copy and paste, those kinda things.\n\n16\n00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.090\nBut I have seen this completely\nwreak havoc on people's\n\n17\n00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.010\nlives with working in Excel, and\nwhy's it doing that, I don't understand,\n\n18\n00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.780\nand it's not as straightforward\nas you might think.\n\n19\n00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.130\nThis does get into a little\nbit of things that go beyond\n\n20\n00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.540\nwhere we're at right now in\nthe sequence of these episodes.\n\n21\n00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.990\nSome of the things we're gonna\nbe talking about we will\n\n22\n00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.260\ndefinitely cover in future episodes.\n\n23\n00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.580\nThings like cell formatting,\nnumber formatting.\n\n24\n00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.580\nAnd even sometimes in different series,\nlike how to perform functions and\n\n25\n00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.870\nhow do you do your formulas and\nall those things.\n\n26\n00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.030\nSo some of this might be in other places.\n\n27\n00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.910\nSo don't get too hung up on like,\nI don't know what that is or\n\n28\n00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.840\nI don't know how to do that yet.\n\n29\n00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.743\nThat's okay, just remember that when you\nget there and when you start coping and\n\n30\n00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:53.990\npasting it will mess up\nyour world a little bit.\n\n31\n00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.430\nSo just being aware is always one\nof the most important things and\n\n32\n00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.370\nhow to fix it or then you know you just\ngo out online and try to find the answer.\n\n33\n00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.530\nBut hopefully, I can reduce some\nof that friction right now and\n\n34\n00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.680\ngive you a couple of little pointers.\n\n35\n00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.180\nOkay, so let's go ahead and start.\n\n36\n00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.800\nLet's come down on into the computer,\ndon't have anything open.\n\n37\n00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.940\nNo, I do have things open.\n\n38\n00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.630\nI just did this right before.\n\n39\n00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.810\nOkay, I actually have a file\ncalled Christmas Class example.\n\n40\n00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.720\nI had minimized it just to see if I can\nremember what I did five minutes ago.\n\n41\n00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.060\nSo here's my Christmas Cats example,\ngot it zoomed in pretty far so\n\n42\n00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.300\nyou can see everything decently well.\n\n43\n00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.380\nAnd let's talked about some\njust very basic copy and\n\n44\n00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.130\npaste between the same worksheet.\n\n45\n00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.030\nSo I have some text right here Fuego,\nBishop, Pumpkin, and Pooma.\n\n46\n00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.510\nI want to select them,\ncuz you've always got to select to effect.\n\n47\n00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.362\nWhat do I wanna do with this?\n\n48\n00:02:56.362 --> 00:03:01.290\nI wanna copy this because I want to make\nanother little list of their favorite\n\n49\n00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.750\ncat food down here at the bottom.\n\n50\n00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.808\nI can tell you what it is,\nit's Fancy Feast, okay,\n\n51\n00:03:06.808 --> 00:03:09.860\noops, I just plugged it and\nthey like it, and it's good stuff.\n\n52\n00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.350\nAll your cats can like something\ndifferent, but my cats like Fancy Feast.\n\n53\n00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.430\nCan I say Fancy Feast?\n\n54\n00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.230\n&gt;&gt; Well you just did Vonne,\nso were gonna allow it.\n\n55\n00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.050\nIf nothing else, maybe we could cut it\nout or maybe copy something over it,\n\n56\n00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.620\nbut we'll just have to wait and see.\n\n57\n00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.375\nWe'll ask an appropriate managerial\nperson what the decision is.\n\n58\n00:03:30.375 --> 00:03:33.940\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, anyways we're gonna\nkeep on cutting and copying and\n\n59\n00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:34.760\npasting this one.\n\n60\n00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.188\nSo once I've selected this information,\nwhat do I want to do?\n\n61\n00:03:39.188 --> 00:03:43.020\nI wanna copy, there's so\nmany ways you can copy.\n\n62\n00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.080\nIf you want to I will tell you I\nvery rarely go up to this button,\n\n63\n00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.910\nthere are buttons up on our home tab\nthat looks like two pieces of paper\n\n64\n00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:52.720\nthat you can copy.\n\n65\n00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.122\nNow there's this drop down that says Copy\nas Picture which I've found interesting.\n\n66\n00:03:57.122 --> 00:04:01.320\nI wanna select this and then make an image\nout of it an paste it as a graphic.\n\n67\n00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.170\nHonestly, I can see that,\n\n68\n00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.250\nin the sense that you don't want somebody\nto see your formulas, or the information.\n\n69\n00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.045\nThis is just a picture\nof the information and\n\n70\n00:04:12.045 --> 00:04:16.466\nyou can't edit it like\nregular cell information.\n\n71\n00:04:16.466 --> 00:04:18.930\nSo, I just thought that was interesting,\nthat it is there.\n\n72\n00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.410\nSo if I copy, that's one way.\n\n73\n00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.480\nYou can also right click, or\nCtrl +click on your keyboard.\n\n74\n00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.687\nSo then I can go ahead and copy, or\n\n75\n00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:36.810\nyou can do my favorite short\ncut which is Cmd+C, C for copy.\n\n76\n00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.140\nAs soon as you do that, notice that\nyou get what I call the running ants.\n\n77\n00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.400\nAnd I'm just gonna click down here so\nyou can see it.\n\n78\n00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.390\nThose little ants running around\nis just indicating to you that\n\n79\n00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:53.590\nthat is the thing right now that\nit has stored in its memory bank.\n\n80\n00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.520\nAnd it is remembering,\nit's on what's known as the clipboard.\n\n81\n00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.980\nCuz anytime that you copy or\n\n82\n00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.810\ncut something, it goes to this\nplace called the clipboard.\n\n83\n00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.720\nAnd the clipboard is not\njust within this program.\n\n84\n00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.445\nIt's across your whole computer,\n\n85\n00:05:08.445 --> 00:05:12.780\ncuz you can copy something from Excel and\npaste it into Word.\n\n86\n00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.800\nOr copy something from a web page and\nthen paste it into Excel.\n\n87\n00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.040\nSo it goes beyond just the Office\nclipboard, it's all the way across.\n\n88\n00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.170\nSo once I find the place\nthat I want to paste it,\n\n89\n00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.770\nlet's say down here,\nI'm just going to paste.\n\n90\n00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.690\nNotice I did not select\nthe same amount of information.\n\n91\n00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:41.570\nI'm selecting the cell, and if I\nright-click, and then paste or Ctrl+V.\n\n92\n00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.360\nV for, I would say victory\nbecause you know where to put it.\n\n93\n00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.475\nI also said like, Elmer's glue or glue,\n\n94\n00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:54.140\n[LAUGH] you turn it upside down,\nand it comes to a point.\n\n95\n00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.360\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I can see that.\n\n96\n00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.830\nI mean, other than the plethora\nof product placements,\n\n97\n00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.650\nI can see why you would think that, right?\n\n98\n00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.460\nYou've got the little V and its coming to\na point and its putting it right there,\n\n99\n00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.010\nright there it is.\n\n100\n00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.970\n&gt;&gt; That's where its going.\n\n101\n00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:13.790\nSo if I pasted, notice it's going to paste\nin those cells, one, two, three, four.\n\n102\n00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:19.637\nl did not have to select the four\ncells to begin with just put in and\n\n103\n00:06:19.637 --> 00:06:22.029\nthen place it or paste it.\n\n104\n00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:26.500\nYeah, okay, also notice it is bigger,\n\n105\n00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:32.820\nit's bold,\nit is remembering all of your formats.\n\n106\n00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.980\nThat is by default, that's what it does.\n\n107\n00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.330\nNow this little guy down here,\nthis little thing.\n\n108\n00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.330\nThis is called a smart tag.\n\n109\n00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.180\nWe'll get into that in just a little bit.\n\n110\n00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.910\nWe're just gonna go ahead and\nsay that's what it does by default.\n\n111\n00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:49.660\nCool, but the running ants,\nI know sometimes this drives people crazy.\n\n112\n00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.580\nWhy are there ants on my computer?\n\n113\n00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.920\nWell, hopefully it's not cuz you're eating\na bunch of chips and you've got ants\n\n114\n00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.920\nrunning around on them, but no this is on\nthe screen, you just hit the escape key.\n\n115\n00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.930\nAnd when you hit the escape key,\nthen it stops the running ants and\n\n116\n00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:14.290\nit cancels it's memory of what\nyou have selected to be copied.\n\n117\n00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.955\nThat's what the running ants can do.\n\n118\n00:07:16.955 --> 00:07:19.050\nAll right, very simple, right?\n\n119\n00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.680\nSelect, copy, find your place, paste.\n\n120\n00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:29.040\nCool, but\nthat's just straight up text in a cell.\n\n121\n00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:34.240\nIt gets a little hairy when\nyou get into cells that\n\n122\n00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:39.530\ndon't have just straight values,\nthey have formulas.\n\n123\n00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.120\nRight here, in our daily totals.\n\n124\n00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:47.660\nNow up in the formula bar, that's just\nthe text, so we're good there, 113.\n\n125\n00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.547\nThat is the result of\nthe sum of B6 through B9.\n\n126\n00:07:51.547 --> 00:07:58.294\nThat's not $140.13, it's a formula, right?\n\n127\n00:07:58.294 --> 00:08:02.798\nWhen you take this, and\nif select these cells And I copy it.\n\n128\n00:08:02.798 --> 00:08:05.870\nI'm gonna right click so\nyou can see what I'm doing.\n\n129\n00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:09.130\nI'm gonna start a new workbook just so\nI can start putting stuff in.\n\n130\n00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.990\nKeyboard stroke it is Cmd+N or\nI can come up to file and\n\n131\n00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:13.750\nI can go to new and\nI have a blank new workbook.\n\n132\n00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.430\nI'm gonna go right here, A16.\n\n133\n00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:22.910\nNotice I'm not selecting anything first.\n\n134\n00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:26.820\nI'm selecting the first cell where I\nwant that selected copied cells to go.\n\n135\n00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.530\nAnd I'm just gonna paste.\n\n136\n00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:29.490\nAnd watch what happens.\n\n137\n00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.054\nThat does not look anything like,\n\n138\n00:08:33.054 --> 00:08:36.792\nI'm using my short cuts of command\ntilde to switch back here, does it?\n\n139\n00:08:36.792 --> 00:08:40.767\nNope, it's just blank\nwhy is it doing that?\n\n140\n00:08:40.767 --> 00:08:45.733\nAgain, so many things that you don't\nknow anything about right now if you're\n\n141\n00:08:45.733 --> 00:08:47.020\njust starting out.\n\n142\n00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.959\nThis is because when you're\ncopying the formulas,\n\n143\n00:08:49.959 --> 00:08:54.049\nyou are copying the formula itself,\nand it is changing the references.\n\n144\n00:08:54.049 --> 00:08:58.480\nIn other words, talking about relative\nreference, to then reference the same\n\n145\n00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.990\nrange but in a different place and\nnow it's trying to sum up B11 through B14.\n\n146\n00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:06.300\nThere's nothing in B11 through B14 so\nsame thing.\n\n147\n00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.154\nI don't know what to do.\nSo that's why it's blank.\n\n148\n00:09:08.154 --> 00:09:13.110\nYou're not copying over $140 and 13 cents.\n\n149\n00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:16.820\nNow remember, this is still,\nit's in it's memory.\n\n150\n00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.010\nBecause that's another thing\nwith these running answers.\n\n151\n00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:21.200\nIt's like, what if I want to copy or\npaste it again?\n\n152\n00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:24.580\nLet's try that in a different place.\n\n153\n00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:26.380\nLet's come over here to G1.\n\n154\n00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.620\nI'm gonna do the same thing.\n\n155\n00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:33.230\nI'm gonna paste and now I get\na totally different result right here.\n\n156\n00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:37.010\nIt's gonna be these reference and\nit looks really mean.\n\n157\n00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:37.704\nIt's a warning, okay.\n\n158\n00:09:37.704 --> 00:09:41.656\nIt's telling you, you've got\na problem that it doesn't understand.\n\n159\n00:09:41.656 --> 00:09:46.548\nHey, you're referencing cells but because\nI'm copying over the formula but I don't\n\n160\n00:09:46.548 --> 00:09:52.090\nsee anything above it cuz you're in row\none, so I don't know what to do with this.\n\n161\n00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:56.830\nYou see already you've run in to\ntwo things where you if you're not\n\n162\n00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:01.360\nfully understanding what Excel does\nespecially in the world of functions or\n\n163\n00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:06.680\nformulas, this could be very upsetting for\nlack of a better term.\n\n164\n00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:11.340\nCuz I just wanna copy $140.13,\nI just need to go ahead and\n\n165\n00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.480\nreport this information somewhere else.\n\n166\n00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.870\nSo why can't I do that?\n\n167\n00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:18.800\nWell, because that's\njust the way Excel works.\n\n168\n00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:23.190\nAnd two, you need to have paste options.\n\n169\n00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:27.230\nThat's options of what I'm pasting and\nhow it's gonna be pasted.\n\n170\n00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:30.160\nThat is a huge\n\n171\n00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:35.230\nthing to understand about working\nwithin Excel and copying and pasting.\n\n172\n00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:38.960\n&gt;&gt; So, Yvonne, even when these references\ngo away the format still comes along with\n\n173\n00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.730\nit in this paste.\n\n174\n00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:43.640\nWe just get the reference\nerrors because that formula.\n\n175\n00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:49.230\nIf I go back up to one of those\nformulas that say pound ref.\n\n176\n00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:51.460\nSo it should be something to something.\n\n177\n00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:54.010\nThat replaces that with pound ref.\n\n178\n00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:56.800\nYou would have to go look at the original\n\n179\n00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.400\npart where you copied it from to\nunderstand what that formula meant.\n\n180\n00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.590\nAgain, we're ahead of ourselves here,\nbut if you needed to go back and\n\n181\n00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:05.420\nsee, what was that doing again?\n\n182\n00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:09.660\nIf you paste it and does the ref, you\ngotta go look at the original one, right?\n\n183\n00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:14.593\n&gt;&gt; It's saying, I don't have a reference\nto reference myself from where you\n\n184\n00:11:14.593 --> 00:11:16.798\nwere exactly right here on this.\n\n185\n00:11:16.798 --> 00:11:17.778\nI'm pointing at my screen.\n\n186\n00:11:17.778 --> 00:11:22.112\nThis one right here, it didn't give\nme the same one because it's saying\n\n187\n00:11:22.112 --> 00:11:27.084\nrelatively from where I was, notice right\nhere, there was one blank and then one,\n\n188\n00:11:27.084 --> 00:11:30.589\ntwo, three, four, so\nthis is at this particular place.\n\n189\n00:11:30.589 --> 00:11:35.180\nAnd then four cells above it\nwith one space in between.\n\n190\n00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:40.350\n&gt;&gt; If you switch back over to this one,\nsee it's in row 16.\n\n191\n00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:43.940\nBut one space and then four.\n\n192\n00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:46.120\nThat's the whole relative reference.\n\n193\n00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.490\nThis is saying,\nI don't have anything above me.\n\n194\n00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:52.180\nI don't have a row and\nthen four more cells above me,\n\n195\n00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.310\nso I don't understand what's going on.\n\n196\n00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.690\nThat's what the real error is throwing.\n\n197\n00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:58.370\nSo, exactly.\n\n198\n00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:01.590\nGo back, like you're saying, to what\nyou had and maybe you can go ahead and\n\n199\n00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:02.960\nfigure it out.\n\n200\n00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:06.510\nBecause of the formulas and everything.\n\n201\n00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:11.300\nThe paste options, that's where\nit can help you, because again,\n\n202\n00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:15.930\nI only wanted $140.13 to be copied and\npasted into where I wanna go.\n\n203\n00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:22.540\nSame thing with, sorry, if you get\ninto the formatting of everything.\n\n204\n00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.480\nOkay, so both of these,\n\n205\n00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.320\nall of these things together are gonna\ncome into play with paste options.\n\n206\n00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.570\nI just hit the Esc key to cancel the ants.\n\n207\n00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:31.850\nLet's start with this,\ncuz these are all just values, okay.\n\n208\n00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:35.170\nBut if I select this and\n\n209\n00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:41.080\nI copy, let's switch over,\nto switch over to another Workbook.\n\n210\n00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:46.170\nAnd I come here and I paste, by default,\n\n211\n00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:49.760\nbut, okay, now there's two things\nthat happened right here, okay.\n\n212\n00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:55.180\nNotice it's making a bold this, but\nwhy does that look different than that?\n\n213\n00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:59.450\nThis is pink and teal and\nthis is blue and blue.\n\n214\n00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:00.930\nWhy is that happening?\n\n215\n00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:06.020\nThat's actually a result\nof different cell styles.\n\n216\n00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:11.380\nDifferent styles and themes that\ncome along with your styles that\n\n217\n00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:13.690\nthey don't match they're\nstill heading ones.\n\n218\n00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:17.980\nThese are formatted as\na heading one style.\n\n219\n00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.680\nBut the style definition in book two\nis different than the style definition\n\n220\n00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.670\nChristmas Cats example.\n\n221\n00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:25.880\nJust nod and say, okay.\n\n222\n00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:30.600\nYou'll get to that later on, but that's\nwhy we're having this, that one thing.\n\n223\n00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.240\nKeep going, Justin?\n\n224\n00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:37.550\n&gt;&gt; So, hold on, now, I'm trying to get my\nmind like okay, I'm just gonna to let her\n\n225\n00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:42.880\ndo her thing, but\n&gt;&gt; So if I have a mismatch in styles,\n\n226\n00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:47.890\nthen am I kind of at a loss here in\na paste or do I have to remake those?\n\n227\n00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:50.670\nWe were talking about paste options,\nis that part of our\n\n228\n00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:54.240\noptions that are coming up,\nis to make sure those come over with it?\n\n229\n00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.880\n&gt;&gt; Yes, okay and that's right here.\n\n230\n00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:01.950\nYou see that little smart tag, that\nsmart tag is actually really important.\n\n231\n00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:07.620\nBecause it's giving me, smartly\n[LAUGH] the options that I can use.\n\n232\n00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:11.110\nNow notice right here,\nUse Destination Theme,\n\n233\n00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:16.810\nthen I say something about themes, Mm-hm,\nyeah, styles and themes go all together.\n\n234\n00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:20.190\nAnd so\nit's using the destination theme but\n\n235\n00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:23.240\nwatch what happens if I choose\nkeep source formatting.\n\n236\n00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:30.530\nThat's where keep the source of\nwhere I copied and use that.\n\n237\n00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:32.410\nThis doesn't always happen, okay?\n\n238\n00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:33.450\nJust so you know.\n\n239\n00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:37.260\nLike, for example,\nif I switch back over, watch here well,\n\n240\n00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.110\nit's already selected and already copied,\nso I don't have to do it again.\n\n241\n00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:45.380\nBut just for fun, if I copy this and\nthen let's do this.\n\n242\n00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:49.370\nMaking a new worksheet and then I paste.\n\n243\n00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:53.460\nThat didn't do it did it?\n\n244\n00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.690\nBut it didn't make it blue and\neverything, why?\n\n245\n00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:59.550\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nI'm gonna go out on a limb here, Yvonne.\n\n246\n00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:02.150\nI'm gonna say because this\nis in the same workbook and\n\n247\n00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:04.220\nthe styles have already been set.\n\n248\n00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.670\nSo it's aware of those styles?\n\n249\n00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:12.180\n&gt;&gt; Yes, because themes are workbook\nwide and workbook specific.\n\n250\n00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:15.890\nThat's why when I come back over here and\ndo it,\n\n251\n00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:22.040\nit's gonna default to its default theme,\nwhich is something different.\n\n252\n00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:26.950\nBut I have those options that I can\nkeep that source formatting and\n\n253\n00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:32.120\nkeep everything in reverse, we'll say?\n\n254\n00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.590\nOkay, I'm just scrolling down here.\n\n255\n00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:35.580\nRemember this is still copy.\n\n256\n00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:39.540\nIf I paste it again,\nI could do something else.\n\n257\n00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.590\nMaybe I don't want any of\nthe source formatting,\n\n258\n00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:44.140\nI don't want to be in\nthe destination formatting.\n\n259\n00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:45.220\nYou know what?\n\n260\n00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.310\nI just don't want you to\nkeep anything in there.\n\n261\n00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:49.590\nLook at all these other\noptions that we have.\n\n262\n00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:54.564\nWe have Match Destination Formatting,\nValues and Number Formatting,\n\n263\n00:15:54.564 --> 00:15:57.671\nKeep Width, Formatting Only, Link Cells.\n\n264\n00:15:57.671 --> 00:16:02.127\nOkay, what if I just did Value and\nNumber Formatting.\n\n265\n00:16:02.127 --> 00:16:04.343\nDo you see how it just\ntook everything out?\n\n266\n00:16:04.343 --> 00:16:06.120\nIt's just cleared it all.\n\n267\n00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.058\nI don't want any of the things\nyou got going on in there.\n\n268\n00:16:09.058 --> 00:16:12.325\nJust go ahead and change it to,\nit's almost like text only.\n\n269\n00:16:12.325 --> 00:16:13.868\nBut it's not full text only,\n\n270\n00:16:13.868 --> 00:16:18.081\ncuz it's still remembering that this\nis formatted as a counting self-format.\n\n271\n00:16:18.081 --> 00:16:20.185\nSo it's not just the number 25.\n\n272\n00:16:20.185 --> 00:16:26.588\nA little beyond, but just remember\nI've said this for later episodes.\n\n273\n00:16:26.588 --> 00:16:31.171\nSo there's a lot of options\nthat you can have with this.\n\n274\n00:16:31.171 --> 00:16:37.830\nFor example, if I'm back over here and\nI paste and then I said, you know what?\n\n275\n00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:43.040\nI only want to, I don't want any of it.\n\n276\n00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.717\nNotice how, look at this one.\n\n277\n00:16:44.717 --> 00:16:47.595\nYou see how that looks\ncompletely different.\n\n278\n00:16:47.595 --> 00:16:50.450\nLet me do that again.\n\n279\n00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:51.050\nSee?\n\n280\n00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:54.050\nNumbers, dollar signs,\nall that kind of fun stuff.\n\n281\n00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:59.609\nAnd then I say, nope,\nI just want you to destination formatting.\n\n282\n00:16:59.609 --> 00:17:03.452\nCell formatting, these cells are not\nformatted as accounting right now.\n\n283\n00:17:03.452 --> 00:17:06.857\nThey're formatted as general numbers and\nit's gonna take the dollar signs, and\n\n284\n00:17:06.857 --> 00:17:07.901\nthe decimal points off.\n\n285\n00:17:07.901 --> 00:17:10.813\nAgain, coming later.\n\n286\n00:17:10.813 --> 00:17:12.464\n&gt;&gt; So I think I have this right.\n\n287\n00:17:12.464 --> 00:17:16.360\nValues and numbers,\nit will remove all the pretty styles.\n\n288\n00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:21.230\nBut it will keep information that may be\nnecessary for the data to make sense.\n\n289\n00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:22.966\n&gt;&gt; The formatting in the cell type,\n\n290\n00:17:22.966 --> 00:17:25.514\nthe data types if you wanna\nsay in your language.\n\n291\n00:17:25.514 --> 00:17:30.356\n&gt;&gt; Because these numbers and then $45,\nthose could be different things.\n\n292\n00:17:30.356 --> 00:17:31.080\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n293\n00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.704\n&gt;&gt; I like to think of it as a unit.\n\n294\n00:17:32.704 --> 00:17:33.743\nHow old are you?\n\n295\n00:17:33.743 --> 00:17:34.488\nEight.\n\n296\n00:17:34.488 --> 00:17:35.313\nEight what?\n\n297\n00:17:35.313 --> 00:17:38.208\nWell, a lot of times we imply years.\n\n298\n00:17:38.208 --> 00:17:42.177\nBut sometimes people may have different\nunits, so it looks like values and\n\n299\n00:17:42.177 --> 00:17:45.264\nnumbers keep units and\nmaybe some other ancillary thing.\n\n300\n00:17:45.264 --> 00:17:47.307\nTake away all the pretty, but\n\n301\n00:17:47.307 --> 00:17:52.217\nthen destination formatting will\nkind of coerce that information into\n\n302\n00:17:52.217 --> 00:17:56.984\nwhatever the current formatting of\nthe where you're pasting it to.\n\n303\n00:17:56.984 --> 00:17:57.731\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n304\n00:17:57.731 --> 00:17:59.590\n&gt;&gt; I got tired just trying to get that.\n\n305\n00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:03.363\nI was just making sure I had all that\nin my mind like, hold on a second.\n\n306\n00:18:03.363 --> 00:18:06.877\nBecause this can be really tricky,\nthat's a long list of options.\n\n307\n00:18:06.877 --> 00:18:10.392\nI mean, it could kinda wreck your day,\nif you're just pointing and clicking.\n\n308\n00:18:10.392 --> 00:18:12.421\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and that's why I've had so\n\n309\n00:18:12.421 --> 00:18:14.037\nmany people struggle with this.\n\n310\n00:18:14.037 --> 00:18:20.734\nAnd if you have to understand Excel in\nits totality, what is number formats?\n\n311\n00:18:20.734 --> 00:18:22.260\nWhat are cell formats?\n\n312\n00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.605\nWhat are themes?\n\n313\n00:18:24.605 --> 00:18:26.193\nWhat is source formatting?\n\n314\n00:18:26.193 --> 00:18:27.995\nWhat is destination formatting?\n\n315\n00:18:27.995 --> 00:18:29.664\nWhat are values only?\n\n316\n00:18:29.664 --> 00:18:32.476\nAll of these things come into play.\n\n317\n00:18:32.476 --> 00:18:35.788\nAnd it's important to\njust understand them and\n\n318\n00:18:35.788 --> 00:18:38.862\njust wrap your head\naround it all together.\n\n319\n00:18:38.862 --> 00:18:41.664\nAnd again, that's why I'm\nforeshadowing into some other things.\n\n320\n00:18:41.664 --> 00:18:45.030\nLet me switch back over to\nour Christmas Cats example.\n\n321\n00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:46.209\nCome back over to here.\n\n322\n00:18:46.209 --> 00:18:50.658\nRemember the whole,\nI just want the $140.13?\n\n323\n00:18:50.658 --> 00:18:54.363\nIf I copy this,\nI'll sorry I use the shortcut Ctrl+C.\n\n324\n00:18:54.363 --> 00:18:59.717\nI have this selected and copied now\ncommand to data switch over to book two.\n\n325\n00:18:59.717 --> 00:19:03.587\nI come over here and\nthen I paste and notice I could just\n\n326\n00:19:03.587 --> 00:19:08.317\ngo to paste special right away,\nbut I'm going to use the paste and\n\n327\n00:19:08.317 --> 00:19:12.367\nthen use my whoops my smart\ntag of I just want the values.\n\n328\n00:19:12.367 --> 00:19:13.508\nI don't want anything else.\n\n329\n00:19:13.508 --> 00:19:17.616\nI just want 143 and 13.\n\n330\n00:19:17.616 --> 00:19:18.347\nThat's all I want.\n\n331\n00:19:18.347 --> 00:19:21.837\nNotice the dollar sign went away,\nI don't have it with the underlines and\n\n332\n00:19:21.837 --> 00:19:23.145\nthe bolds and everything.\n\n333\n00:19:23.145 --> 00:19:27.677\nI just want the values and the reason\nwhy that option was available to me,\n\n334\n00:19:27.677 --> 00:19:29.624\nthis one and not the other one.\n\n335\n00:19:29.624 --> 00:19:31.735\nWe didn't see values\nonly on the other one.\n\n336\n00:19:31.735 --> 00:19:33.006\nThis was a formula.\n\n337\n00:19:33.006 --> 00:19:34.498\nThis was copying over formulas.\n\n338\n00:19:34.498 --> 00:19:38.927\nAnd now it's like take it out of\nthe formula, make it a value and\n\n339\n00:19:38.927 --> 00:19:41.010\nthen take everything out.\n\n340\n00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:45.938\nSo that's why your paste\noptions are going to vary,\n\n341\n00:19:45.938 --> 00:19:52.213\ndepending on the thing that you\nare copying and then pasting into.\n\n342\n00:19:52.213 --> 00:19:54.093\nLots of different things.\n\n343\n00:19:54.093 --> 00:19:58.473\n[SOUND] Now,\nlet's talk about a few other things.\n\n344\n00:19:58.473 --> 00:20:03.280\nAgain, use your paste options.\n\n345\n00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.215\nWhile I'm still here, sorry,\nlet me complete this thought.\n\n346\n00:20:05.215 --> 00:20:08.003\nThe whole I wanna go ahead and paste, but\n\n347\n00:20:08.003 --> 00:20:11.286\nI know I want something\nother than the default.\n\n348\n00:20:11.286 --> 00:20:15.303\nYou can go into the paste special\nbefore you even do it and\n\n349\n00:20:15.303 --> 00:20:20.190\na lot of these are going to values,\nformats, all except boarders.\n\n350\n00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:24.975\nYou see there's some really like more\nadvanced things that you can do when\n\n351\n00:20:24.975 --> 00:20:26.216\nyou're pasting.\n\n352\n00:20:26.216 --> 00:20:29.442\nPasting a link,\ndoing some operations when you paste.\n\n353\n00:20:29.442 --> 00:20:31.375\nThis gets way beyond what we need to do,\nbut\n\n354\n00:20:31.375 --> 00:20:34.291\nI just wanted to show you like\nthe values and the number formats.\n\n355\n00:20:34.291 --> 00:20:36.052\nAll in merge this.\n\n356\n00:20:36.052 --> 00:20:39.456\nFormulas and number formats.\n\n357\n00:20:39.456 --> 00:20:42.211\nUse all using source theme.\n\n358\n00:20:42.211 --> 00:20:45.179\nAll of those options that I was\nshowing you after the fact,\n\n359\n00:20:45.179 --> 00:20:46.460\nyou can control before.\n\n360\n00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:50.187\nAnd if I did values right now,\nthen it would give me the same options.\n\n361\n00:20:50.187 --> 00:20:54.586\nSo paste special is the same\nthing as me pasting and\n\n362\n00:20:54.586 --> 00:20:57.527\nthen going to the paste options.\n\n363\n00:20:57.527 --> 00:21:01.343\nThe running ants, we've talked about\nthat is where if you cancel it,\n\n364\n00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:04.852\nyou wanna hit the Escape key or\nyou can just keep it in its memory.\n\n365\n00:21:04.852 --> 00:21:06.174\nThat can be very handy.\n\n366\n00:21:06.174 --> 00:21:08.693\nI'm gonna go ahead and hit the Escape.\n\n367\n00:21:08.693 --> 00:21:14.031\nWe alluded to this in the other\nepisode with the move and copy.\n\n368\n00:21:14.031 --> 00:21:15.193\nThat's kind of a fun one.\n\n369\n00:21:15.193 --> 00:21:18.752\nSo if I selected to say\nthese numbers right here and\n\n370\n00:21:18.752 --> 00:21:23.855\nI wanted to move it down here and\ncopy, I'm gonna zoom out a little bit.\n\n371\n00:21:23.855 --> 00:21:27.873\nCuz it's easier when I can\nhave it all in one screenshot.\n\n372\n00:21:27.873 --> 00:21:30.414\nGet the move or the hand.\n\n373\n00:21:30.414 --> 00:21:35.134\nHold the Alt key or\nyour Option key and then drag.\n\n374\n00:21:35.134 --> 00:21:37.812\nLet go of your mouse first.\n\n375\n00:21:37.812 --> 00:21:41.427\nDon't let go of your Alt key first,\ncuz then it's gonna cancel the copying.\n\n376\n00:21:41.427 --> 00:21:44.742\nAnd so that's kind of a fun\nway to do a move and copy.\n\n377\n00:21:44.742 --> 00:21:46.350\nNotice there's no ants, so\n\n378\n00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:51.220\nit doesn't remember it like you would\nif you selected and actually copied it.\n\n379\n00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:57.484\nBut it's a fun one that I like to do.\n\n380\n00:21:57.484 --> 00:22:02.131\nNow copying and pasting columns and\nthere's actually,\n\n381\n00:22:02.131 --> 00:22:05.532\nI wanted to get another file for this one.\n\n382\n00:22:05.532 --> 00:22:08.433\nI wanted to get the navigate a workbook.\n\n383\n00:22:08.433 --> 00:22:11.223\nThere's a reason why I'm\ngrabbing this particular file,\n\n384\n00:22:11.223 --> 00:22:13.583\nbecause this is just like\na list of phone numbers.\n\n385\n00:22:13.583 --> 00:22:16.053\nI'm gonna command til\nthey they back over here.\n\n386\n00:22:16.053 --> 00:22:18.719\nI have one here, but\nthis is formatted as a table and\n\n387\n00:22:18.719 --> 00:22:22.820\nI'm not ready to talk about tables right\nnow and I don't wanna work with them.\n\n388\n00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:27.848\nTables are really cool, but\nwe're not doing that here.\n\n389\n00:22:27.848 --> 00:22:29.965\nWorking with columns and rows.\n\n390\n00:22:29.965 --> 00:22:32.394\nWe talked about how we can select them.\n\n391\n00:22:32.394 --> 00:22:36.513\nIf I come up to the top and\nI select column D,\n\n392\n00:22:36.513 --> 00:22:42.597\nblack arrow point down and\nI want to copy this, you can do that.\n\n393\n00:22:42.597 --> 00:22:44.158\nYou can copy full rows.\n\n394\n00:22:44.158 --> 00:22:45.736\nYou can copy multiple rows.\n\n395\n00:22:45.736 --> 00:22:47.150\nYou can copy multiple columns.\n\n396\n00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:51.050\nIf I copy this,\nnow where do I wanna put this?\n\n397\n00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:56.115\nIf I come over here to column B,\nnow if I select column B,\n\n398\n00:22:56.115 --> 00:23:02.100\nright-click and then paste,\nwhat did I just do?\n\n399\n00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:07.640\nI wrote like basically over wrote\nthe column of last name, didn't I?\n\n400\n00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:14.180\nOoh, but I really wanted to\njust put that in before it.\n\n401\n00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:20.024\nCareful about that one, very careful about\nthat and then there's this other thing.\n\n402\n00:23:20.024 --> 00:23:22.420\nJust stay with me for a minute.\n\n403\n00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:25.530\nThere's another thing\nabout if you select this.\n\n404\n00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:32.307\nLet's just say, I selected the cells,\ndid not select column and I copy this.\n\n405\n00:23:32.307 --> 00:23:36.420\nAnd I come over here to\nthe top of column D and\n\n406\n00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:41.343\nI right-click and I say,\npaste, then it pastes.\n\n407\n00:23:41.343 --> 00:23:42.263\nOoh, that's kinda weird.\n\n408\n00:23:42.263 --> 00:23:48.449\nBut then there is also\nthis Insert Copied Cells.\n\n409\n00:23:48.449 --> 00:23:52.919\nThat's one that's weird, because a lot\nof times like, this Mike and I were just\n\n410\n00:23:52.919 --> 00:23:57.025\ntalking about this where I wanted to\nright-click and I wanted to insert.\n\n411\n00:23:57.025 --> 00:23:59.730\nBut then there's insert copied cell,\nso what does that do?\n\n412\n00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:04.947\nAnd then you say like Shift it down or\nto the right, and then it doesn't.\n\n413\n00:24:04.947 --> 00:24:10.990\nIt's this weird kind of like,\nit's moving around your content.\n\n414\n00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:14.285\nAnd if I shift all the cells down,\ndo you see how it moves it down and\n\n415\n00:24:14.285 --> 00:24:17.090\nthen puts it, but\nit's in the same column, okay?\n\n416\n00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:20.550\nThat's if you select cells.\n\n417\n00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:24.910\nI'm doing a shortcut,\nI'll talk about it in a minute, okay?\n\n418\n00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:26.720\nBut what about this?\n\n419\n00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:30.412\nIf I Copy this, and\nthen right-click here, and\n\n420\n00:24:30.412 --> 00:24:35.650\nInsert the copied cells, you see it\njust made a whole nother column?\n\n421\n00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:40.120\nIt gets a little convoluted on here.\n\n422\n00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:42.365\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'll tell you Vonne,\nthat's not super intuitive to me,\n\n423\n00:24:42.365 --> 00:24:45.750\ncuz I was like, it's gonna, hold on,\nthat didn't do what that other thing did.\n\n424\n00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:49.640\nBut that's important to know\nbecause I will tell you\n\n425\n00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:51.760\nthat would've been\nthe bane of my existence.\n\n426\n00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:55.686\nThat's a good 20-minute excursion for\nme going, now hold on a second,\n\n427\n00:24:55.686 --> 00:24:58.506\nif I have these little\nsubsections that shifts down.\n\n428\n00:24:58.506 --> 00:25:02.670\nBut then if I had a whole column,\nit actually adds a column.\n\n429\n00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:07.110\nI don't know if I'm a huge, it's good\nto know, because it can be handy.\n\n430\n00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:09.850\nNot sure I'm a huge fan of that decision,\nthough.\n\n431\n00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:16.698\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and whether you were selecting\ncells versus selecting columns,\n\n432\n00:25:16.698 --> 00:25:21.263\nand then choosing to\nInsert Copied Cells versus\n\n433\n00:25:21.263 --> 00:25:25.842\nInsert Copied Cells with a column,\nand [SOUND].\n\n434\n00:25:25.842 --> 00:25:28.180\nVery, just be aware.\n\n435\n00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:30.860\nAnd again,\nI've watched people struggle with this.\n\n436\n00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:32.110\nI've struggled with it.\n\n437\n00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:38.185\nWhereas I really wanted to Insert\na column first, and then I\n\n438\n00:25:38.185 --> 00:25:43.406\nwanna take this text, and I wanted to Copy\nit and then come over here and Paste it.\n\n439\n00:25:43.406 --> 00:25:47.900\nSo just, again, Insert, if you know you\nneed to kinda move things around and\n\n440\n00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:52.410\nput things in new columns or\nput things in new rows, just think about\n\n441\n00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:56.230\nputting in the new columns or\nrows first before you start copying and\n\n442\n00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:59.130\npasting because then it will make\nyour life a little bit easier.\n\n443\n00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:04.291\nAnd the whole Insert Copied Cells does\ndepend on whether you're doing it\n\n444\n00:26:04.291 --> 00:26:09.900\nby the column, meaning selecting\nthe column, or by the cells, okay?\n\n445\n00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:14.140\nI know that's a little open-ended, and\nI know that's a little kind of like,\n\n446\n00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:18.460\nI'm not feeling very solid\non this whole topic.\n\n447\n00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:23.140\nJust be aware, okay,\nslow down, think about it.\n\n448\n00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:25.212\nI need a new column,\nInsert the column first.\n\n449\n00:26:25.212 --> 00:26:26.735\nI wanna take this and put it over here.\n\n450\n00:26:26.735 --> 00:26:28.516\nOkay, do that second, okay?\n\n451\n00:26:28.516 --> 00:26:31.714\nSo modify your spaces with\nyour workbook rows and\n\n452\n00:26:31.714 --> 00:26:34.700\ncolumns before you start going and\ncopying.\n\n453\n00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:39.310\nGet the destination space set first and\nthen put it into it.\n\n454\n00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:42.765\n&gt;&gt; So this same exact thing happens if\nI did rows, like row selections and\n\n455\n00:26:42.765 --> 00:26:43.712\nthings like that?\n\n456\n00:26:43.712 --> 00:26:49.030\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yes, and if I wanted to\nInsert, just put a new row by itself.\n\n457\n00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:51.830\nOkay, cuz that's where\nI wanted to take this.\n\n458\n00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:57.230\nAnd Copy it because I wanted\nto put that right here, okay?\n\n459\n00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:02.880\nWhether I'm selecting a row\nversus selecting cells.\n\n460\n00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.955\nBig deal, and the same thing.\n\n461\n00:27:05.955 --> 00:27:08.230\nSo just be careful of it.\n\n462\n00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:11.230\nOne last thing I wanna talk about,\nI've been talking all about Copy,\n\n463\n00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:12.710\nhaven't I, okay?\n\n464\n00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:14.010\nYeah, Cut.\n\n465\n00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:16.420\nWhat's the difference between Cut and\nCopy?\n\n466\n00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:21.200\n&gt;&gt; So when I think of Cut, I'm like,\nI'm removing it in addition to copying it.\n\n467\n00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.870\nIt is equivalent to, or\nexcuse me, I'm removing it and\n\n468\n00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:27.366\nthen putting it in a destination place.\n\n469\n00:27:27.366 --> 00:27:29.851\nIt is equivalent, I've seen people do\nthis, they'll Copy, they'll Paste, and\n\n470\n00:27:29.851 --> 00:27:30.946\nthen they'll come back and delete.\n\n471\n00:27:30.946 --> 00:27:33.177\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, I'm like, just Cut it.\n\n472\n00:27:33.177 --> 00:27:34.278\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, take it out.\n\n473\n00:27:34.278 --> 00:27:35.743\n&gt;&gt; So, Cut it is a delete operation.\n\n474\n00:27:35.743 --> 00:27:40.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just cut it out,\nyou gotta take it out of there.\n\n475\n00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.710\nYeah, and the thing with Excel that you\nneed to be aware of, if I wanted to\n\n476\n00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:49.170\nremove this for whatever reason,\nI'm just grabbing a bunch of cells.\n\n477\n00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:53.090\nIf I Cut this, it doesn't take it out.\n\n478\n00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:54.970\nAnd people are like, no,\nbut I told it to Cut.\n\n479\n00:27:54.970 --> 00:28:00.580\nIt doesn't remove\nthe information until you Paste.\n\n480\n00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:03.300\nAnd you're saying now it takes it out.\n\n481\n00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:04.590\nSo don't let that trip you up.\n\n482\n00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:07.690\nI was like, why won't you Cut, go away!\n\n483\n00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:10.018\nNo, you gotta just get it down.\n\n484\n00:28:10.018 --> 00:28:14.040\nYou gotta Paste it first, and\nthat's where it comes into play.\n\n485\n00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:17.080\nSo, something to know about.\n\n486\n00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.075\nExcel just does that, so.\n\n487\n00:28:19.075 --> 00:28:22.912\n&gt;&gt; Now, Vonne, you said you were gonna\ntell us something you were using.\n\n488\n00:28:22.912 --> 00:28:25.130\nYou were in a trickster\na little while ago.\n\n489\n00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:28.940\nBut when you Cut things, a lot of times\nI've run into, you're like, oops,\n\n490\n00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:30.760\nI cut the wrong thing.\n\n491\n00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:33.140\nI need to roll it back.\n\n492\n00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:37.032\nYou did that a little while ago, but\nyou said, I will come back to that.\n\n493\n00:28:37.032 --> 00:28:40.230\nI think this might be a good time to say,\nhow do I roll that back?\n\n494\n00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:42.130\n&gt;&gt; I'm so glad you reminded me about that.\n\n495\n00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:46.930\nYes, our best friend in the world, Undo.\n\n496\n00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:49.510\nMy gosh, couldn't live without it, okay?\n\n497\n00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:53.620\nUndo is go back in time,\ngo back in my history.\n\n498\n00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:57.660\nUndo, up at the top,\nnotice it says Z in there.\n\n499\n00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:59.886\nZ, and we were talking about\nthis before the episode.\n\n500\n00:28:59.886 --> 00:29:04.860\nCmd+Z, or Ctrl+Z in a PC,\nit's kind of across the board for\n\n501\n00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:08.320\nmost programs,\nthat that will take you back.\n\n502\n00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:14.413\nSo I'm doing Cmd+Z, taking me back,\nbut I could also click this button.\n\n503\n00:29:14.413 --> 00:29:16.650\nThe other thing is like,\nlook what just happened.\n\n504\n00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:18.610\nI'm not in Christmas Cats anymore, am I?\n\n505\n00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:19.730\nI'm in Navigate a Workbook.\n\n506\n00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:23.420\nIf I keep going backwards,\nback, back, keep on going back.\n\n507\n00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:24.980\nHow far we going back?\n\n508\n00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:28.280\nWay back, and\nit goes a little something like this.\n\n509\n00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:32.390\nSo, how long can I go backwards, right?\n\n510\n00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:36.470\nWell, there is a whole list right here.\n\n511\n00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:40.914\nI can drop this down, and\nI can go as far back, well,\n\n512\n00:29:40.914 --> 00:29:43.959\nkind of as far back as I want to here.\n\n513\n00:29:43.959 --> 00:29:45.660\nNow, I don't remember where that was.\n\n514\n00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:49.990\nSo I usually go step by step\nby step by step by step\n\n515\n00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:54.409\nto keep on going backwards until I\nkinda figure out where I'm going.\n\n516\n00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:59.040\nIf you can go back,\nyou can also go forward.\n\n517\n00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:05.179\nI can go forward, forward, forward,\nkeep on going, keep on going, or Cmd+Y.\n\n518\n00:30:05.179 --> 00:30:12.068\nSo I just keep on doing my Cmd+Y, and\nI can keep on forwarding [LAUGH].\n\n519\n00:30:12.068 --> 00:30:17.716\nGoing back and redoing all that,\nand so that's, yes, Undo,\n\n520\n00:30:17.716 --> 00:30:22.949\nyou ever go, oops,\nhit the Undo button or do your Cmd+Z.\n\n521\n00:30:22.949 --> 00:30:27.590\nIf you wanna Redo it, you do Cmd+Y.\n\n522\n00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:33.021\nIt does go across all of our workbooks,\neverything that I've done in Excel.\n\n523\n00:30:33.021 --> 00:30:38.606\n&gt;&gt; All right, so that's the currently open\nworkbook, so if I have multiple workbooks\n\n524\n00:30:38.606 --> 00:30:43.971\nopen, if I were to close a workbook, do\nthose get removed from the Undo history?\n\n525\n00:30:43.971 --> 00:30:47.315\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna say yes [LAUGH].\n\n526\n00:30:47.315 --> 00:30:48.290\nWe could try it.\n\n527\n00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:49.930\n&gt;&gt; Let's just,\nlet's give it a whirl, right?\n\n528\n00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:52.319\n&gt;&gt; Let's do it.\n&gt;&gt; Take it for a spin, so to speak.\n\n529\n00:30:52.319 --> 00:30:55.009\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\nwe're going to not save the changes.\n\n530\n00:30:55.009 --> 00:30:59.720\nAnd yeah, that's how far I went\nback in Christmas Cats example.\n\n531\n00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.850\nSo, but ooh, but look,\nI did all of that in there, too.\n\n532\n00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:04.030\nRemember this?\n\n533\n00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:05.590\nI can't Undo that far back.\n\n534\n00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:09.980\nSo yeah, I guess it took wherever\nit was and it cut the history off.\n\n535\n00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:12.502\nAnd maybe not let me Undo anymore.\n\n536\n00:31:12.502 --> 00:31:16.130\nSo ooh,\nthat might be a little scary about that.\n\n537\n00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:18.727\nSo, [SOUND], be careful about that.\n\n538\n00:31:18.727 --> 00:31:24.500\nIt doesn't, this is where, back up, and if\nyou don't, at worst, you know what you do?\n\n539\n00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:28.340\nYou Close, you Don't Save,\nand you just say,\n\n540\n00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:31.900\nnope, I'm not gonna save any of my\nchanges cuz I don't remember how far.\n\n541\n00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:35.618\nI just need to go back to where\nI had no workbooks open, and\n\n542\n00:31:35.618 --> 00:31:39.194\nthen I have a new starting\npoint from where I need to go.\n\n543\n00:31:39.194 --> 00:31:41.755\nAnd just a little bit of history,\n\n544\n00:31:41.755 --> 00:31:45.790\ndo you know how many Undos\nthat you can have in Excel?\n\n545\n00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:48.640\n&gt;&gt; Total for an open Excel session?\n\n546\n00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:52.477\n&gt;&gt; Yea, like how many Undos\nis it going to log for me?\n\n547\n00:31:52.477 --> 00:31:54.345\n&gt;&gt; 65,536?\n\n548\n00:31:54.345 --> 00:31:56.419\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] No [LAUGH].\n\n549\n00:31:56.419 --> 00:31:58.984\n&gt;&gt; 12 [LAUGH].\n\n550\n00:31:58.984 --> 00:32:00.538\n&gt;&gt; 100.\n\n551\n00:32:00.538 --> 00:32:02.033\n&gt;&gt; I was close [LAUGH].\n\n552\n00:32:02.033 --> 00:32:08.207\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it will take 100 for you, and\nthat's how many Undos it will remember.\n\n553\n00:32:08.207 --> 00:32:11.705\nBut yeah, as we saw, if we have multiple\nworkbooks, it can cut that off, and\n\n554\n00:32:11.705 --> 00:32:13.657\nyou might have done a hundred things,\nbut then you close one and\n\n555\n00:32:13.657 --> 00:32:15.135\nthen it takes all that other stuff out.\n\n556\n00:32:15.135 --> 00:32:17.795\nSo it can be a, your mileage may vary.\n\n557\n00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:22.990\n&gt;&gt; Well, that is definitely great\nwords of advice there, Vonne.\n\n558\n00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:27.330\nAnd you've shown us a lot more\nthan I anticipated from just\n\n559\n00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:30.650\nwhat I consider a simpler operation.\n\n560\n00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:34.130\nDefinitely some of those gotcha moments\nare, you need to remind us, right?\n\n561\n00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:37.750\nThat whole Copy and Paste columns and\nall that shenanigans.\n\n562\n00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:40.220\nDefinitely keep those in mind because\nthose can lead to frustration.\n\n563\n00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:44.150\nAnd well, a frustrated individual\nis an unproductive individual.\n\n564\n00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:46.900\nSo we want you to stay productive,\nso don't be frustrated.\n\n565\n00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:47.790\nBut before we go,\n\n566\n00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:51.390\nlooks like Vonne's got one last thing\nto tell us before we get outta here.\n\n567\n00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:55.410\n&gt;&gt; I know we're already past our time on\nthis episode of hey, we've gotta go, but\n\n568\n00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:58.690\nI do want to allude to one thing, and\nI'm just gonna keep it as a cliffhanger.\n\n569\n00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:00.600\nI'll show it in the next episode.\n\n570\n00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:03.080\nI didn't show you how to Copy and\nPaste from Word.\n\n571\n00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:04.870\nAnd there's a cute little things on there.\n\n572\n00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:05.990\nSo you know what,\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n573\n00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:10.460\ntack that on in the next one and\njust have a continuation on that.\n\n574\n00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:12.160\nSo, remind me, okay?\n\n575\n00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:13.756\nI'm gonna make a note on myself,\ntoo [LAUGH].\n\n576\n00:33:13.756 --> 00:33:16.130\n&gt;&gt; Well, we definitely have\na nailbiter there, everyone.\n\n577\n00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:19.440\nSo definitely join us back as\nwe see how that all plays out.\n\n578\n00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.810\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget outta here.\n\n579\n00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:23.820\nSo signing off for OfficePro.TV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n580\n00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:24.640\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n581\n00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.398\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n582\n00:33:26.398 --> 00:33:31.673\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:17.481\nI'm your host Justin Dennison.\n\n4\n00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:21.858\nAnd we're continuing on with our Excel\n2016 essentials for Mac series and well,\n\n5\n00:00:21.858 --> 00:00:24.607\nwe're actually gonna be\ntalking about fill series.\n\n6\n00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:26.056\nWell, be careful there.\n\n7\n00:00:26.056 --> 00:00:29.961\nI've said the word series two different\ntimes, but they mean two different things.\n\n8\n00:00:29.961 --> 00:00:31.935\nAnd hopefully to make us less confused,\n\n9\n00:00:31.935 --> 00:00:35.309\nwe have someone in the studio who\nwill help us out, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n10\n00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.082\nHow are you doing today, Vonne?\n&gt;&gt; Good,\n\n11\n00:00:37.082 --> 00:00:38.562\nI just realized you did say it twice.\n\n12\n00:00:38.562 --> 00:00:46.002\nI was like the series of the show and\nthe fill series that we're going to do.\n\n13\n00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:47.830\nI see what you did there.\n\n14\n00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:48.869\nGood job.\n\n15\n00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:51.351\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I do try to make it, well,\n\n16\n00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:54.231\nat least engaging, but fill series.\n\n17\n00:00:54.231 --> 00:00:58.407\nI've used Excel before,\nI know where we're going, but\n\n18\n00:00:58.407 --> 00:01:01.630\nmaybe I should ask where\ndo we need to start?\n\n19\n00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.663\nIs there any things that we need\nto know before we really dive\n\n20\n00:01:04.663 --> 00:01:05.258\nin?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n21\n00:01:05.258 --> 00:01:08.779\nthere is one thing that we're gonna\nstart with that has nothing to do with\n\n22\n00:01:08.779 --> 00:01:10.000\nfill series.\n\n23\n00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.502\nBecause I told you about\nit in the last episode,\n\n24\n00:01:13.502 --> 00:01:16.929\nif you're watching in,\nseries of our shows.\n\n25\n00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:21.165\nYou know that I had one last thing\nto talk about with copy and paste.\n\n26\n00:01:21.165 --> 00:01:27.168\nI know, it's crazy, it's going into\na second episode with copy and paste.\n\n27\n00:01:27.168 --> 00:01:29.476\nBut it does pertain somewhat,\n\n28\n00:01:29.476 --> 00:01:35.532\nsomehow to the fill series that we will be\ndoing in this episode that is the title.\n\n29\n00:01:35.532 --> 00:01:36.784\nSo why don't we get started?\n\n30\n00:01:36.784 --> 00:01:38.262\nLet's jump down into here.\n\n31\n00:01:38.262 --> 00:01:39.479\nI already have a workbook open.\n\n32\n00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.282\nIt's the one that we\nwere working with before.\n\n33\n00:01:41.282 --> 00:01:43.362\nAnd we'll keep on doing\nsome more stuff with it.\n\n34\n00:01:43.362 --> 00:01:47.937\nSo this is the navigate a workbook,\ntalk about Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, we copied,\n\n35\n00:01:47.937 --> 00:01:51.011\nwe did all sorts of things\nwith our paste options, and\n\n36\n00:01:51.011 --> 00:01:55.310\ntalked about how you can really\nget tripped up with everything.\n\n37\n00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.450\nSo the last thing I wanted to show\nyou was copying from other sources.\n\n38\n00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.837\nNow, there's a ton of other\nsources that you can go ahead and\n\n39\n00:02:03.837 --> 00:02:07.028\nget information from,\na Word document, a PowerPoint,\n\n40\n00:02:07.028 --> 00:02:11.250\nwhatever application you're working with,\nthe Internet.\n\n41\n00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.867\nI'm gonna just stick with Word since\nit is a part of the Office series and\n\n42\n00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:16.932\nyou can kind of go back and forth with it.\n\n43\n00:02:16.932 --> 00:02:19.417\nSo I wanna show you a few\nlittle nuisances about that.\n\n44\n00:02:19.417 --> 00:02:23.827\nAnd then I just realized that I forgot\nto open up the Word document, so\n\n45\n00:02:23.827 --> 00:02:25.980\nwhy don't I do that, all right?\n\n46\n00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.835\nSo I have a file called Copy for\nExcel it will open up in Word.\n\n47\n00:02:30.835 --> 00:02:35.219\nAnd in Word totally not Excel,\nExcel is in rows and columns and\n\n48\n00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:38.100\ncells here we have paragraphs, right?\n\n49\n00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.932\nEvery time you hit the Enter key on\nthe keyboard you're making a paragraph.\n\n50\n00:02:41.932 --> 00:02:46.442\nI also have my show on high characters\non right now even if you don't know\n\n51\n00:02:46.442 --> 00:02:51.403\nanything about Word, I have a whole series\non that, I have three series on it,\n\n52\n00:02:51.403 --> 00:02:52.620\nlove me some Word.\n\n53\n00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.996\nSo if I scroll on down to here,\nnotice that we just have some paragraphs.\n\n54\n00:02:56.996 --> 00:03:04.120\nI've got Alice and Bell and Bishop so\nEntering every time from here.\n\n55\n00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.233\nWell, if I have something like this.\n\n56\n00:03:06.233 --> 00:03:08.043\nAnd I wanna use this in Excel,\n\n57\n00:03:08.043 --> 00:03:12.319\nbecause I want to start tracking\ntheir favorite food or their treats,\n\n58\n00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.050\nor what have you, it would be easier\nto do in a tabular-type format.\n\n59\n00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.741\nSo, why don't I go ahead and\nstart from there?\n\n60\n00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:22.040\nGreat point, and yeah, we're gonna do it.\n\n61\n00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.783\nSo you're gonna click, hold and drag.\n\n62\n00:03:22.783 --> 00:03:25.744\nWe're gonna select all of\nthe paragraphs within this\n\n63\n00:03:25.744 --> 00:03:28.640\nparticular page of this document.\n\n64\n00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.609\nI'll right click so\nyou guys can see me copying or\n\n65\n00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:34.006\nCmd+C, I forget we're in Mac still.\n\n66\n00:03:34.006 --> 00:03:37.660\n[LAUGH] Let's pop on over to Excel.\n\n67\n00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.927\nI'm gonna go over here to Sheet 3 just so\nwe can have a little bit blank space and\n\n68\n00:03:43.927 --> 00:03:45.842\nI'm gonna start right here.\n\n69\n00:03:45.842 --> 00:03:50.657\nThe biggest thing to\nremember about copying and\n\n70\n00:03:50.657 --> 00:03:55.770\npasting from Word to Excel\nis do not double click.\n\n71\n00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.587\nDo not activate your cursor into\nthe cell If you select one cell,\n\n72\n00:03:59.587 --> 00:04:03.968\nyou don't even have to select anything\nelse, you don't select a range,\n\n73\n00:04:03.968 --> 00:04:07.518\njust a single one where we\nwanted to start, and just paste.\n\n74\n00:04:07.518 --> 00:04:12.265\nIt will come in as individual rows.\n\n75\n00:04:12.265 --> 00:04:16.083\nSo now Bell has its own cell,\nBishop, Blossom, Brandy, and so\n\n76\n00:04:16.083 --> 00:04:18.149\nyou can go on down, oops, sorry.\n\n77\n00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:22.079\nI was getting a little fancy and I dragged\nand I was trying to move something and\n\n78\n00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.035\nit was trying to replace the information\nso that's why it got a little wonky.\n\n79\n00:04:26.035 --> 00:04:27.731\nBut that's pretty cool, all right?\n\n80\n00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:28.605\nI do this a lot.\n\n81\n00:04:28.605 --> 00:04:31.865\nYou just gotta remember to\nnot try to insert the text,\n\n82\n00:04:31.865 --> 00:04:33.753\ncuz let me show you what I mean.\n\n83\n00:04:33.753 --> 00:04:35.540\nIf I double click.\n\n84\n00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.003\nSo now I have a flashing\ncursor in that active cell.\n\n85\n00:04:40.003 --> 00:04:41.990\nAnd then I paste, so dong a Cmd+V.\n\n86\n00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.785\nIt looks like the same, but when I click\noff of this, look just what happened.\n\n87\n00:04:47.785 --> 00:04:52.030\nAll of this information\nis in a single cell.\n\n88\n00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.782\nAnd it can be very misleading, because if\nyou look up at the formula bar, it's like,\n\n89\n00:04:56.782 --> 00:04:57.928\nwhat's going down here?\n\n90\n00:04:57.928 --> 00:04:59.760\nBut remember that expansion?\n\n91\n00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.954\nThere are what are known as line breaks.\n\n92\n00:05:03.954 --> 00:05:07.870\nNot Enter marks, but\nwhat we would say, Shift+Enter.\n\n93\n00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.212\nIn Word, we Shift+Enter.\n\n94\n00:05:09.212 --> 00:05:13.560\nIn Excel, it's actually Alt or Opt+Enter.\n\n95\n00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.515\nSo you can make multi lined text within\na cell because if you try to hit Enter,\n\n96\n00:05:18.515 --> 00:05:21.082\nit's just going to go to the next cell.\n\n97\n00:05:21.082 --> 00:05:25.437\nJust to show you what I mean, let me just\nclick off this, let me zoom in a little\n\n98\n00:05:25.437 --> 00:05:29.990\nbit so you can see and I'm gonna come\nover here to this cell right here.\n\n99\n00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.214\nI'm gonna double click and\nif I type in Vonne, and\n\n100\n00:05:34.214 --> 00:05:39.453\nif I wanted to put fake Justin,\nsame cell but a separate line.\n\n101\n00:05:39.453 --> 00:05:43.041\nYou would do Alt+Enter or Opt+Enter.\n\n102\n00:05:43.041 --> 00:05:48.828\nAnd there's that line break\nwithin an Excel cell.\n\n103\n00:05:48.828 --> 00:05:54.779\nSo now if I type in Justin and\nhit Enter, Enter just moves down one,\n\n104\n00:05:54.779 --> 00:06:01.496\nso it's like a navigation thing, so\nthat is a multi-lined cell in Excel.\n\n105\n00:06:01.496 --> 00:06:05.332\nAnd that's what essentially you're doing\nwhen you double click to go ahead and\n\n106\n00:06:05.332 --> 00:06:08.784\npaste that information from Word.\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne, I do have a quick question.\n\n107\n00:06:08.784 --> 00:06:12.190\nWhen you pasted that,\ndon't double click to select, right?\n\n108\n00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.010\nWhen you pasted those and\nyou got the individual cells,\n\n109\n00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.950\nthat's because I had a paragraph\ncharacter, and that's\n\n110\n00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.983\nwhat was the delimiting character to\ndetermine what the next set of cells were.\n\n111\n00:06:21.983 --> 00:06:24.356\nDo I have that understood correctly?\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n112\n00:06:24.356 --> 00:06:25.769\n&gt;&gt; And if that is the case,\n\n113\n00:06:25.769 --> 00:06:31.010\nwhat would happen if I come here and\nI have sentences, or even whole paragraph?\n\n114\n00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.036\nMaybe I'm getting ahead\nof myself there Vonne.\n\n115\n00:06:33.036 --> 00:06:35.524\n&gt;&gt; No, no, exactly, like right here.\n\n116\n00:06:35.524 --> 00:06:37.920\nCuz this is one paragraph, right?\n\n117\n00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.633\nBut it's multiple sentences and\nit is separated by it.\n\n118\n00:06:41.633 --> 00:06:43.603\nThat's why I had to show high characters,\n\n119\n00:06:43.603 --> 00:06:46.390\nwhich is like showing every\ntime I actually enter.\n\n120\n00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:48.494\nSo if I selected, we'll even do here.\n\n121\n00:06:48.494 --> 00:06:55.670\nWe'll go from here down to this\nparagraph and I copy, Cmd+C.\n\n122\n00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:02.195\nI am going to Command tab\nto switch applications.\n\n123\n00:07:02.195 --> 00:07:04.400\nYep, start trying.\n\n124\n00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.604\nIt's some really good stuff.\n\n125\n00:07:05.604 --> 00:07:08.670\nLet me just come down here\nto get some more blank.\n\n126\n00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:13.696\nI'll click in the first, just one cell and\nnow I will paste, Cmd+V.\n\n127\n00:07:13.696 --> 00:07:17.481\nAnd yes, it will do by paragraphs so\nyou can see, and\n\n128\n00:07:17.481 --> 00:07:21.620\nremember the whole like\nretain the formatting, right?\n\n129\n00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.395\nIt's still changing this to red text.\n\n130\n00:07:24.395 --> 00:07:26.610\nThis is a green text.\n\n131\n00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:30.914\nSo every time it's a change in paragraph\nand because we don't have any cells next\n\n132\n00:07:30.914 --> 00:07:34.665\nto it, this is what lives in this one\ncell, in this cell and this cell.\n\n133\n00:07:34.665 --> 00:07:38.864\nSo every change in paragraph\nputs in all of what's in that\n\n134\n00:07:38.864 --> 00:07:43.443\nparagraph within that one cell.\n&gt;&gt; Well that would definitely be tricky.\n\n135\n00:07:43.443 --> 00:07:47.746\nIs that the only character that could be\nused as the delimiting character from\n\n136\n00:07:47.746 --> 00:07:48.550\nWord to that?\n\n137\n00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:54.210\nDoes it default to the paragraph,\nthe return or\n\n138\n00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:56.364\nthe enter I'm thinking of the enter.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n139\n00:07:56.364 --> 00:07:57.809\n&gt;&gt; And can I change that?\n\n140\n00:07:57.809 --> 00:07:59.976\n&gt;&gt; Well, in Word you don't really have any\n\n141\n00:07:59.976 --> 00:08:02.216\nother delimiter besides Shift+Enter.\n\n142\n00:08:02.216 --> 00:08:03.599\nTo move you down.\n\n143\n00:08:03.599 --> 00:08:08.289\nSo in that sense, with a Shift+Enter,\nit thinks it's all one paragraph so\n\n144\n00:08:08.289 --> 00:08:09.840\nit has to be a paragraph.\n\n145\n00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.240\nThe only other thing I can maybe, because\n\n146\n00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:18.010\nwhat other delimiters do you have in Word\nbesides Enter to make a new paragraph?\n\n147\n00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:20.370\nSo in that sense,\nthat's the only one it is.\n\n148\n00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:26.262\nBut along that same thought process,\nyou do have tables in Word.\n\n149\n00:08:26.262 --> 00:08:29.160\nI'm gonna just zoom out a little bit so\nyou can see this a little bit better.\n\n150\n00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.460\nThere is a table, right?\n\n151\n00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:35.130\nA table's rows and columns,\nisn't that what Excel is?\n\n152\n00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:38.120\nSo what happens if I\nselect the entire table?\n\n153\n00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.650\nOr anything that's already\nin a tabular format.\n\n154\n00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:43.730\nThis also goes into HTML, right?\n\n155\n00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:48.160\nYou can make a table in HTML with TR's and\nTD's, don't worry about that they're tags\n\n156\n00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.630\nand that's just how it goes ahead and\nmakes your columns and rows.\n\n157\n00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:55.700\nBut if I select the whole table and\nI copy this, switch back over to Excel,\n\n158\n00:08:55.700 --> 00:09:00.070\njust kind of scrolling down,\nand then paste\n\n159\n00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:05.260\nIt see it as columns and\nrows because it already in that format.\n\n160\n00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.830\nNow it does go ahead and\nkeep the source formatting.\n\n161\n00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.850\nBut you do have your paste options.\n\n162\n00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:14.630\nSo I can match the destination formatting\nand now I have what was already set as\n\n163\n00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:21.630\na table in Word, into Excel in their\ncells and I can move along that way.\n\n164\n00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:26.078\nUsing Word, what if there was a text\neditor or any other type of program.\n\n165\n00:09:26.078 --> 00:09:28.620\nEnters will make your cells.\n\n166\n00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:32.100\nI can't guarantee that it's\nalways going to be like that.\n\n167\n00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:35.610\nI mean the translation,\nif you want to say, that kind of happens\n\n168\n00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:39.890\nbetween different application into\nExcel and how Excel is going to see it.\n\n169\n00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:42.609\nI can't guarantee that you\nwill always get this results.\n\n170\n00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:48.210\nIn from Word, I can 99,\n90% [LAUGH] guarantee it's\n\n171\n00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:53.140\ngoing to happen that way.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We always get,\n\n172\n00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:58.370\nI'm absolutely, not quite certain\nthat's true when I say it out loud.\n\n173\n00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:04.390\nBut that's good to know, because I\nhave copied and pasted things before.\n\n174\n00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:06.940\nAnd I haven't had the hide characters on,\nand\n\n175\n00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:11.325\nwent, that went straight across,\nthat is not what I expected.\n\n176\n00:10:11.325 --> 00:10:17.425\nAnd it was because of something crazy, not\nhaving an Enter key as a delimiter factor.\n\n177\n00:10:17.425 --> 00:10:18.605\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, those delimitters,\n\n178\n00:10:18.605 --> 00:10:19.605\nwe're gonna talk about.\n\n179\n00:10:19.605 --> 00:10:21.075\nA delimiter is just a separator, okay.\n\n180\n00:10:21.075 --> 00:10:23.775\nWe're gonna talk about that in the next\nepisode when we start getting into file\n\n181\n00:10:23.775 --> 00:10:26.635\nformats and we get into our CSVs and\neverything.\n\n182\n00:10:26.635 --> 00:10:29.805\nSo yeah, it's just, and\nwe talk about character sets.\n\n183\n00:10:29.805 --> 00:10:30.435\nIt's so much fun.\n\n184\n00:10:30.435 --> 00:10:34.560\nBut yeah, it's because of all\nthe way all of these languages.\n\n185\n00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:39.670\nAre written can get a little, it can\nget a little wonky from time to time.\n\n186\n00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:43.740\nThe same would be if you were trying\nto copy something from say a website.\n\n187\n00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:48.490\nIf it was in straight paragraphs, but you\nknow with websites, it might look like,\n\n188\n00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:50.300\nit's just text on a page, and\n\n189\n00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:54.990\nit is nothing like that in the background\nwithin the HTML that is written in.\n\n190\n00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:59.570\nSo that can get a little weird\ntoo because if I took this and\n\n191\n00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:05.340\nI selected it and I copied it,\nI did test this one so it should work.\n\n192\n00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:10.420\nIf I click here and paste,\nokay there's one paragraph or\n\n193\n00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.880\none cell and this is another cell.\n\n194\n00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:18.030\nI cannot guarantee that on every single\nwebsite, that I will say pretty certain,\n\n195\n00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:20.650\nI know it won't be the same across.\n\n196\n00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:23.950\nBut anyways, I just wanted to go ahead and\ncover that little part.\n\n197\n00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:28.290\nI do a lot of back and\nforth from Excel to Word or\n\n198\n00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:30.878\nWord to Excel in this exact reason.\n\n199\n00:11:30.878 --> 00:11:34.111\nI started right in this app, but\nnow I wanna track it, I track it in Excel.\n\n200\n00:11:35.629 --> 00:11:40.003\nSo copying and pasting we did talk\nabout that just a second ago and\n\n201\n00:11:40.003 --> 00:11:45.680\nthen over here we talked about remember we\nhad our option drag when we had our moves.\n\n202\n00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.370\nWe can go ahead and move that over.\n\n203\n00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:52.690\nWe also did our Cmd + C, Cmd + V, and\nthen if I wanted to do this a couple\n\n204\n00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:57.660\nmore times I could just go ahead and\npaste paste paste paste or I can alt drag.\n\n205\n00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:02.470\nCuz maybe I just need a Hello World\nquite a few times down this one column.\n\n206\n00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:06.403\nOr I need it to take move here,\nand then Alt + drag,\n\n207\n00:12:06.403 --> 00:12:09.700\nAlt + drag, Alt + drag, option.\n\n208\n00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.480\nIt still says, it says alt, right,\non our keyboard in the Mac.\n\n209\n00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.970\nSo I'm so used to just saying Alt.\n\n210\n00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.152\nThose are all copies and pastes.\n&gt;&gt; And pastes.\n\n211\n00:12:18.152 --> 00:12:22.320\n[LAUGH] But I will tell you, Vonne, that\nstill seems like a whole lot of work if I\n\n212\n00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.980\njust want a whole bunch of duplicates.\n\n213\n00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.510\nAre you about to tell me\nthere's a better way?\n\n214\n00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:27.367\n&gt;&gt; Yes I am.\n\n215\n00:12:27.367 --> 00:12:33.330\n[LAUGH] And we're to our fill series,\nor our fill handle.\n\n216\n00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:39.040\nWe talked about this in our\nepisode about mouse cursor icons.\n\n217\n00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:43.570\nI can't remember the actual episode name\nthat we did this, but we talked about,\n\n218\n00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:48.800\nokay make sure you have the white plus\nsign to select, the hand to move.\n\n219\n00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:53.370\nAnd then the little black plus sign over\nthere on the bottom right hand corner of\n\n220\n00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:58.110\nany active cell Is going to\ngive you the build handle\n\n221\n00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:04.170\nbuild handle has a couple\ndifferent functionalities\n\n222\n00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:09.646\nits first primary job is to copy.\n\n223\n00:13:09.646 --> 00:13:12.170\nOkay, I'm just going to type in here,\n\n224\n00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:15.030\nyou know I'm going to type in\nthe word Justin, all right.\n\n225\n00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:20.280\nHey Justin, I wanna have you all over\nhere we're just going to copy on down.\n\n226\n00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.929\nYou don't do a Ctrl + C,\nCtrl + V, you single-click,\n\n227\n00:13:23.929 --> 00:13:26.670\nselect the cell that you want.\n\n228\n00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:28.700\nGo to the bottom right hand corner,\n\n229\n00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.590\nget that black plus sign\nwith your fill handle.\n\n230\n00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:36.190\nClick hold, drag down, and\nwe just got a whole bunch of Justins,\n\n231\n00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:38.710\nlook at that.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if the world's ready for\n\n232\n00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:39.906\nthat.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n233\n00:13:39.906 --> 00:13:41.390\n&gt;&gt; That is pretty amazing.\n\n234\n00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:43.160\nI did wanna, you say single click.\n\n235\n00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.610\nWhat happens if I double-click and\nthere's a cursor blinking inside of that?\n\n236\n00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:46.950\nWill I just not get the fill handle?\n\n237\n00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:49.150\nOr does it do something different than my.\n\n238\n00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:50.370\nMess up my day.\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n239\n00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:54.690\nnot really, it's just something\nthat I try to emphasize.\n\n240\n00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:57.130\nYou don't need to be\nactivated in the cell.\n\n241\n00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:01.580\nAnd that's the thing, I think sometimes\npeople try to go too far down into, and\n\n242\n00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:04.650\nit's really, no,\nyou just need to cell select it.\n\n243\n00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:08.330\nSo if I double clicked on here,\nI do a flashing cursor here,\n\n244\n00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.520\nI can still get the fill handle.\n\n245\n00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:14.630\nAnd I can still drag down, so no,\nit's not gonna wreck your day.\n\n246\n00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:17.570\nI just try because there's other\nthings that we start getting into.\n\n247\n00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:22.470\nIt's like, no,\ndon't get into the cell to edit.\n\n248\n00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:24.760\nYou just want it selected.\n\n249\n00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:29.510\nSo it's something that I just try to\nemphasize for some stuff down the road.\n\n250\n00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:30.920\nCool, cuz that's what it does.\n\n251\n00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.500\nAnd you can go either way.\n\n252\n00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:37.390\nIf I single click on this, click, hold and\ndrag and go across, notice it's gonna\n\n253\n00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:41.960\ncopy cuz that's fill handle's primary job,\nis to copy.\n\n254\n00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:49.850\nBut there can be some other cool things\nthat the fill handle does, series.\n\n255\n00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:50.670\nLet me show you.\n\n256\n00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:54.760\nLet's jump over to,\nwe'll just go to sheet two.\n\n257\n00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.800\nI'm just trying to find like a blank area.\n\n258\n00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:02.040\nI'm not really too hung up on\nwhere I'm doing this from.\n\n259\n00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:06.950\nLet's start with my favorite\ndays of the week, okay.\n\n260\n00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:09.550\nSo we have Monday.\n\n261\n00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:10.990\nMonday, Monday.\n\n262\n00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.700\nI can feel,\nI always feel the Mondays you know.\n\n263\n00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:19.040\nIt's only you know we had two days off but\nI come in here and I am like wait,\n\n264\n00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:19.620\nhow do I host?\n\n265\n00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:20.280\nHow do I smee?\n\n266\n00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.200\nWhat am I doing?\n\n267\n00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.620\nIt's It's okay.\n&gt;&gt; Well it's funny, you said Monday,\n\n268\n00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:24.430\nMonday twice, and\n\n269\n00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:25.860\nI was about to break into song.\n&gt;&gt; I know!\n\n270\n00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:27.280\n&gt;&gt; And I was like no, nope,\n\n271\n00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:29.890\nwe're doing a show, can't do that.\n&gt;&gt; I know, and you know me,\n\n272\n00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:31.230\nit's very easy for me to do that.\n\n273\n00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:34.660\nSo I had to like pull myself in.\n\n274\n00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:38.160\nAll right,\nnotice I do a flashing cursor in there.\n\n275\n00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.286\nI'll keep it in there, that's fine.\n\n276\n00:15:39.286 --> 00:15:43.868\nBut I wanna fill in Monday,\nTuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,\n\n277\n00:15:43.868 --> 00:15:46.981\nFriday, Saturday I'm not typing it in and\n\n278\n00:15:46.981 --> 00:15:51.143\nyou know what, Excel will do it for\nme, look at it there.\n\n279\n00:15:51.143 --> 00:15:54.129\nPretty cool so\nthis is something I think about.\n\n280\n00:15:54.129 --> 00:15:59.715\nI'm sure you have to I'm calculating how\nmuch food Fuego has eaten every day.\n\n281\n00:15:59.715 --> 00:16:04.020\nI need Monday through Sunday,\nand then guess what?\n\n282\n00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:05.650\nStarts on over again.\n\n283\n00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:10.020\nSo you don't have to type it all in, you\njust type in the first and then it goes.\n\n284\n00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:13.120\nIt doesn't mean you have\nto start on Monday.\n\n285\n00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.390\nYou don't have to fully\ntype out the words.\n\n286\n00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:18.920\nWhat if our work week\nstarts on a Wednesday?\n\n287\n00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:20.538\nWhat if it's WED?\n\n288\n00:16:20.538 --> 00:16:23.873\nCuz that's a common abbreviation for\nthe day of the week, right?\n\n289\n00:16:23.873 --> 00:16:27.080\nStart at Wednesday, move on across.\n\n290\n00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:27.680\nThere you go.\n\n291\n00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.320\nSo now, I've got Wednesday to Wednesday.\n\n292\n00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:34.470\nAnd notice when I was doing that, maybe\nI'll stay here, I'll start on Thursday.\n\n293\n00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:36.610\nIf I went down,\nnotice when I had started dragging,\n\n294\n00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:40.270\nthere's that little thing\noff to the right bottom.\n\n295\n00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.670\nThat is a preview of what is happening.\n\n296\n00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:50.060\nSo I can kinda see, well I need\nThursday to next Thursday, there it is.\n\n297\n00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.420\nAnd then I let go.\n\n298\n00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:54.270\nSo you can just keep\non dragging it down so\n\n299\n00:16:54.270 --> 00:17:00.800\nit recognizes days of the week for\na fill series.\n\n300\n00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.993\nThat's what it means, okay?\n&gt;&gt; Got ya.\n\n301\n00:17:03.993 --> 00:17:04.689\nAnd these,\n\n302\n00:17:04.689 --> 00:17:09.290\nthis is cycling through because the days\nof a week are a special value, right?\n\n303\n00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:11.750\nMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday,\nThursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.\n\n304\n00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:13.790\nMonday again, and so\n\n305\n00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:17.690\nthat's the behavior that we're observing\nhere that isn't always the behavior or\n\n306\n00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:21.360\nit is for all other things?\n&gt;&gt; It will be because this is actually\n\n307\n00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:25.890\npulling from what is known as a custom\nlist that is written in Excel.\n\n308\n00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:28.931\nKeep that thought, because we're\ngonna be able to write our own, okay?\n\n309\n00:17:28.931 --> 00:17:32.051\nBut yes, it gets to the end and\nit goes, well, you know what,\n\n310\n00:17:32.051 --> 00:17:33.555\nwe're gonna go back, okay.\n\n311\n00:17:36.535 --> 00:17:39.055\nAnd just keep thinking there, Justin.\n\n312\n00:17:39.055 --> 00:17:44.380\n[LAUGH] All right other things\nwe do days of the week.\n\n313\n00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:47.470\nHow about months of the year, right?\n\n314\n00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:48.410\nWe need those.\n\n315\n00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:52.380\nJ-A-N, do we wanna type out fully January?\n\n316\n00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:53.410\nWe could.\n\n317\n00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:55.490\nI don't want to because then I\nhave to remember how to spell.\n\n318\n00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:59.100\nSo we're going to do January,\ndo you think it's gonna do it?\n\n319\n00:17:59.100 --> 00:17:59.990\nYep it does.\n\n320\n00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:04.500\nI just drag it down, and\nnow I've got all the months of the year.\n\n321\n00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.470\nThat's pretty cool there.\n\n322\n00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:08.450\nAnd again you can start at anything.\n\n323\n00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:13.390\nMaybe your fiscal year starts in,\nwell you gotta make sure you type in\n\n324\n00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:18.257\nJuly the correct way and then it goes\ndown to June and we can go there.\n\n325\n00:18:18.257 --> 00:18:22.453\nYou do have to type it in right\nbecause if I did J-L-U-Y, all right,\n\n326\n00:18:22.453 --> 00:18:24.588\nand I accidentally misspelled it,\n\n327\n00:18:24.588 --> 00:18:28.776\nwhat do you think it's gonna do Justin?\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna guess that instead of it\n\n328\n00:18:28.776 --> 00:18:33.130\nrecognizing special values from that list,\nit's just gonna copy J-L-U-Y down.\n\n329\n00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.070\nI was right.\n\n330\n00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:35.930\nYay!\n\n331\n00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:39.670\nThat's one for me!\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you get another cookie!\n\n332\n00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:41.990\nI don't have any M&amp;M's today, sorry.\n\n333\n00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:44.400\nI'll go steal some from Mike,\nand we'll get you some.\n\n334\n00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.380\nAll right, yes, so there we go.\n\n335\n00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:48.980\nIt does, because that's the,\nfill handles primary job.\n\n336\n00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:56.620\nThat brings us to hey, well,\nwhat if I didn't want it to recognize?\n\n337\n00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:01.156\nI am cataloging how many cats did\nsomething on a Monday, all right, and\n\n338\n00:19:01.156 --> 00:19:06.240\nI'm gonna have like Monday,\nMonday, Monday, Monday, okay.\n\n339\n00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.920\nWell, guess what?\n\n340\n00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.580\nIt's recognizing that as like a keyword,\nright?\n\n341\n00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:13.936\nDo this, and you're like no,\nI don't wanna do that.\n\n342\n00:19:13.936 --> 00:19:17.206\nEnter in the smart tag, the smart tag or\n\n343\n00:19:17.206 --> 00:19:22.670\nthe autofill options will allow\nyou to do a whole bunch of things.\n\n344\n00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:26.427\nWell one is, hey,\nstop recognizing this as a series.\n\n345\n00:19:26.427 --> 00:19:30.090\nAnd do what your first job is,\nand that's copy it.\n\n346\n00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:32.430\nJust give me all the Mondays.\n\n347\n00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:36.750\nCool, there's other ones in there that I'm\ngonna show you too, because maybe I have\n\n348\n00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.020\nMonday and then I drag this down.\n\n349\n00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.650\nAnd I don't want Saturdays and\n\n350\n00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:46.690\nSundays, because maybe we don't\nwork on Saturdays and Sundays.\n\n351\n00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:49.245\nI only want to fill in the Weekdays.\n\n352\n00:19:49.245 --> 00:19:51.090\nSo, I've got to move down a little bit.\n\n353\n00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:55.681\nThere's weekdays, so\ntakes out the Saturdays and Sundays.\n\n354\n00:19:55.681 --> 00:19:59.766\nSo some really cool things that you\ncan do with your Fill series and\n\n355\n00:19:59.766 --> 00:20:05.070\nthen the options, the smart tag, or\nautofill options, that come along with it.\n\n356\n00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:09.050\nSo that can be pretty cool.\n\n357\n00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:12.855\nAnd for example,\nI'm gonna move over a little bit more.\n\n358\n00:20:12.855 --> 00:20:16.166\nOne of the things that I have to do,\nI have to number sequentially.\n\n359\n00:20:16.166 --> 00:20:21.627\nStart with 1, now you're getting excited,\nright, it's gonna be what,\n\n360\n00:20:21.627 --> 00:20:26.784\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and it will not,\ndoesn't recognize that off the bat.\n\n361\n00:20:26.784 --> 00:20:33.781\nBut yep, there's that option and I can\nfill the series and then it will do it.\n\n362\n00:20:33.781 --> 00:20:37.206\nI show this to people and they're like how\nmany times I'm just doing this manually,\n\n363\n00:20:37.206 --> 00:20:40.760\nI'm typing each number in, I'm like no,\nuse the fill series, it's very handy.\n\n364\n00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.500\n&gt;&gt; So I've actually had this happen,\n\n365\n00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:46.880\ncollecting data, blah, blah, blah\n&gt;&gt; And then I'm like that's annoying.\n\n366\n00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:50.680\nBut if I remember correctly,\nwhat if I type 1, 2 and\n\n367\n00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.850\nhighlight both of those,\nand then fill down,\n\n368\n00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:58.550\ndoes that change the behavior?\n&gt;&gt; Kind of, in the sense that\n\n369\n00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:03.190\nit will recognize the iteration or\nthe sequence.\n\n370\n00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:04.870\nLet me, well keep that thought.\n\n371\n00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:05.570\nLet me show you this.\n\n372\n00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:11.390\nIf I did 5, Enter and then 10, Enter.\n\n373\n00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:15.230\nIf I select both of those first.\n\n374\n00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:17.620\nSelect with the white plus first.\n\n375\n00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:21.710\nThen take the black plus sign and\ndrag down.\n\n376\n00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:25.040\nIt recognizes that pattern.\n\n377\n00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:28.800\nBut if I wanted it to do 5,\n10, 5, 10, 5, 10.\n\n378\n00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.270\nThen I would just go ahead and copy it.\n\n379\n00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:35.470\nSo the whole idea of you saying 1 and\nthen 2 and\n\n380\n00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:38.440\nthen selecting both of them and\nthen copy down.\n\n381\n00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:42.340\nIt's still seeing that as,\nyou wanna count by 1s.\n\n382\n00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:44.410\nAnd then, nope, I want it to copy.\n\n383\n00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:47.970\nSo you just have to know that, that\nsmart tag can kind of flip it back and\n\n384\n00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:50.780\nforth from its behavior.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n385\n00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:53.360\nthat's making a little bit more sense.\n\n386\n00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.520\nBut now, I'm a big proponent of,\n\n387\n00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.060\nlet me see if I can break it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n388\n00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:02.670\n&gt;&gt; What if I type 1, 3 and then 7?\n\n389\n00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:06.020\nAnd then highlight those three and drag\ndown, well what's the default behavior?\n\n390\n00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.240\n&gt;&gt; So 13 and then 7?\n\n391\n00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.533\n&gt;&gt; Actually 1, 3, and\n\n392\n00:22:08.533 --> 00:22:11.626\n7 are what I want to do.\n&gt;&gt; So, 1, 3, 7.\n\n393\n00:22:11.626 --> 00:22:14.400\n&gt;&gt; Because 1 and 3 are only different by\n\n394\n00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:17.010\ntwo, because that's what's setting\nthe step for the sequence.\n\n395\n00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:21.378\nAnd then 3 and 7 are by four,\nit does some weirdness,\n\n396\n00:22:21.378 --> 00:22:23.200\ndoesn't it?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n397\n00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.240\n&gt;&gt; It looks like, so let's see here.\n\n398\n00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.098\nThat's 2, that's 4.\n\n399\n00:22:27.098 --> 00:22:29.420\nI don't know how it's doing that.\n&gt;&gt; I don't either [LAUGH].\n\n400\n00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:30.870\n&gt;&gt; But this is important to know.\n\n401\n00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:31.780\nWe broke it.\n&gt;&gt; You\n\n402\n00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:33.043\ndid.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n403\n00:22:33.043 --> 00:22:38.042\nyou should remember these things because\nthey can make your life a little hell.\n\n404\n00:22:38.042 --> 00:22:41.870\nYou're like why is that counting\nby fractions and crazy stuff?.\n\n405\n00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:45.280\nWell the difference based\non the first two selections\n\n406\n00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.930\nis what determines your\nsequence progression.\n\n407\n00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:49.440\nAnd you don't want that.\n\n408\n00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.610\nYou have to turn it off.\n\n409\n00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:53.570\nAnd if you don't have nice\nprogressions for whatever\n\n410\n00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:56.320\nyou selected then you get weird results.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely.\n\n411\n00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.000\nAnd I like that we did that.\n\n412\n00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.490\nBecause, yeah,\n\n413\n00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:04.190\nthe smart tag is a big thing down at the\nbottom of flipping this back and forth.\n\n414\n00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:06.460\nAnd yeah I have no idea\nwhat this series is.\n\n415\n00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:11.137\nI mean I'm seeing kind of 3s,\nthree and a halfs.\n\n416\n00:23:11.137 --> 00:23:16.102\n1 to 3 is 2 and 3 to 4 is 4.\n\n417\n00:23:16.102 --> 00:23:17.580\nYeah, that would be 3.\n\n418\n00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:18.240\nIsh?\n\n419\n00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:18.990\nMaybe?\n\n420\n00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:19.644\nI don't know.\n\n421\n00:23:19.644 --> 00:23:21.784\nYou know what,\nI am not a good math person.\n\n422\n00:23:21.784 --> 00:23:26.290\nI'll let you go ahead and ponder that\none you little mathematician over there.\n\n423\n00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:30.560\n[LAUGH] So we can see how that works,\nbut that is a really good one.\n\n424\n00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:35.220\nAnd I wanna throw this together with;\nlet's go ahead and do this with text.\n\n425\n00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:41.720\nWatch, if I said Invoice, and\nthen space, and then number 1.\n\n426\n00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:46.180\nNotice that I have text with numbers,\nor number with text.\n\n427\n00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:49.956\nWhen I take and fill this down,\nit automatically starts doing the series.\n\n428\n00:23:49.956 --> 00:23:53.344\nThere's another one where\nyou might wanna go ahead and\n\n429\n00:23:53.344 --> 00:23:55.710\njust copy it over instead of copying.\n\n430\n00:23:55.710 --> 00:24:00.056\nBut notice it does work It doesn't\nhave to be just numbers by itself.\n\n431\n00:24:00.056 --> 00:24:06.700\nIt can be with text, so\nthat's something to think about.\n\n432\n00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:10.100\nAnd this also works with dates.\n\n433\n00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:13.120\nOkay, what if I typed in 3-1-18,\ncuz that's a valid date, right?\n\n434\n00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:16.810\nActually that's today, isn't it?\n\n435\n00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:18.410\nYes, it's March 1st, okay.\n\n436\n00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:21.794\nSo if I hit Enter, just to show you\nthat it's gonna change the date format,\n\n437\n00:24:21.794 --> 00:24:24.444\nwe'll talk all about number\nformats in another episode.\n\n438\n00:24:24.444 --> 00:24:26.806\nClick, hold and drag down and\n\n439\n00:24:26.806 --> 00:24:31.740\nit will automatically start\ndoing that series of dates.\n\n440\n00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:36.782\nKind of nice but then all of your same\noptions that you have are right in here.\n\n441\n00:24:36.782 --> 00:24:41.567\nNotice I have copy,\nI only wanted to have a bunch\n\n442\n00:24:41.567 --> 00:24:45.765\nof iterations of March 1st, 1918.\n\n443\n00:24:45.765 --> 00:24:50.050\n[LAUGH] No, it's 2018, all right.\n\n444\n00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:53.800\nWe could go into, also,\nfill in just the days.\n\n445\n00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:54.550\nWell that is the days.\n\n446\n00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:55.880\nWeekdays, there's one, right?\n\n447\n00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:59.630\nI want it to skip the weekends.\n\n448\n00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:01.360\nSo then it will change that.\n\n449\n00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:05.270\nFive, six, seven, okay, there we go.\n\n450\n00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:07.990\n11, that's a little odd one.\n\n451\n00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:09.130\nOkay, you know what?\n\n452\n00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:10.545\nWhy don't we just go with months?\n\n453\n00:25:10.545 --> 00:25:15.382\nOkay, when something breaks you\njust take it and you start again.\n\n454\n00:25:15.382 --> 00:25:20.660\nAnd then let's see if we can go ahead and\nget those weekdays, there we go.\n\n455\n00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:23.110\nNow that's looking\na little bit more like it.\n\n456\n00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:25.090\nAnd I always tell people,\nif it doesn't work the first time,\n\n457\n00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:27.160\njust stop, just fill it down again.\n\n458\n00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.990\nAnd then we could also go ahead and\njust fill with the months.\n\n459\n00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:34.160\nNotice now it's going by the 1st\nof the month all the way down.\n\n460\n00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:37.970\nOr I can go ahead and do,\nyeah you guessed it, years and\n\n461\n00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:41.740\nthen it will do March 1st for\nall the years down.\n\n462\n00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:46.690\nSo, lots of cool things that you\ncan do with these sequences.\n\n463\n00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:51.050\nWe already talked about the iteration\nof you type in five and ten and\n\n464\n00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:55.120\nthen it goes ahead and\nrecognizes that increment.\n\n465\n00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.960\nAnd then it will fill that down.\n\n466\n00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:04.600\nSo, kind of some fun stuff with\nhow you can do your fill handles.\n\n467\n00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:09.220\nNow, I'm doing everything\nby the fill handle, okay?\n\n468\n00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:13.550\nBut all of this is done with\nwhat is known as Auto Fill.\n\n469\n00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:17.790\nAnd on the Home tab you do\nhave a button way over here\n\n470\n00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:20.690\non the right hand side\nthat talks about fill.\n\n471\n00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:22.960\nOkay, because that's\nwhat we were just doing.\n\n472\n00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.430\nWe were filling a series.\n\n473\n00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:28.080\nWe were also filling down and\nfilling right.\n\n474\n00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.560\nThe nice thing about here is you\ncould also fill up and fill left.\n\n475\n00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.310\nNow you could already do that.\n\n476\n00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:40.060\nFor example, watch, if I took this\nnumber five and I dragged up.\n\n477\n00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:44.320\nI can go up,\nyou don't have to just go right and down.\n\n478\n00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:48.870\nYou can go up and left, and\nstill have the same options.\n\n479\n00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:52.770\nSo if I take this notice that it's\ngoing to then go the other way.\n\n480\n00:26:52.770 --> 00:27:00.330\nBut you could do it through\nthe button over here and that's fine.\n\n481\n00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:03.970\nBut I'll show you a couple other\nlittle shortcuts on that one so.\n\n482\n00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:07.140\nDid you find anything there,\nJustin, about the iterations?\n\n483\n00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:08.670\n&gt;&gt; So I was off camera and\n\n484\n00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:13.090\nI actually confused myself more because\nI created a couple other examples in\n\n485\n00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:17.010\nExcel on my computer and\nI couldn't quite find a pattern.\n\n486\n00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:19.110\nBut I'm not gonna give up.\n\n487\n00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:22.846\nAnd if I do find out, then we may just\nhave to do a quick little blurb or\n\n488\n00:27:22.846 --> 00:27:24.385\nsomething like that.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n489\n00:27:24.385 --> 00:27:25.825\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Maybe it's not in this show,\n\n490\n00:27:25.825 --> 00:27:29.368\nbut I'll try my best to find out.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I feel like he's gonna be working\n\n491\n00:27:29.368 --> 00:27:32.855\non this all night, and he's gonna\ncome to me tomorrow and be like,\n\n492\n00:27:32.855 --> 00:27:35.990\nI still can't figure it out, but\nI spent a lot of time on it.\n\n493\n00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:38.090\n[LAUGH] Cuz I know how your brain thinks.\n\n494\n00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:42.400\nSo, but let me go back to that fill and\nmaybe some shortcuts.\n\n495\n00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:46.770\nI'm gonna jump back over here\nto Sheet 1 for just a minute.\n\n496\n00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:52.530\nAnd I told you that we could go ahead and,\nif I typed in the word Vonne.\n\n497\n00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:55.630\nIt's weird to talk about myself,\nso let's talk about Fuego, okay?\n\n498\n00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:57.831\nSo if I take Fuego, all right?\n\n499\n00:27:57.831 --> 00:27:59.940\nAnd then I not use the fill handle.\n\n500\n00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:06.860\nBut I took this and white plus sign,\nnot the black plus sign, not the hand.\n\n501\n00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:10.050\nJust went ahead and selected these cells.\n\n502\n00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:14.164\nThis is another way that\nI can fill down by just\n\n503\n00:28:14.164 --> 00:28:18.200\nselecting it and\nthen doing the command after.\n\n504\n00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:21.110\nWhat I mean by is notice how\nI've got it selected there.\n\n505\n00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:24.979\nCome to here, go down, and\nthen it [SOUND], it goes this way.\n\n506\n00:28:24.979 --> 00:28:27.792\nBecause I've seen people,\nI don't use the black plus sign,\n\n507\n00:28:27.792 --> 00:28:28.960\nI just go ahead and do this.\n\n508\n00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:31.220\nAnd I'm like, you're right.\n\n509\n00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:33.330\nIt's the same thing basically.\n\n510\n00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:38.450\nSo if I took this, selected\nthe place that I want it to occupy,\n\n511\n00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:42.280\nand then did fill right, it does it.\n\n512\n00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:45.960\nNo, there's nothing wrong with that, okay?\n\n513\n00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.980\nSo if I took like one and\n\n514\n00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:52.185\nthen selected down to here,\nI'm also gonna do a little shortcut now.\n\n515\n00:28:52.185 --> 00:28:56.603\nInstead of doing that menu command,\nor the ribbon command,\n\n516\n00:28:56.603 --> 00:28:59.818\nif you do Cmd D, D for\ndown, it will do that.\n\n517\n00:28:59.818 --> 00:29:03.635\nBut notice I didn't get the little\nsmart tag and everything.\n\n518\n00:29:03.635 --> 00:29:07.505\nThat's where,\nif you typed in the number one here,\n\n519\n00:29:07.505 --> 00:29:12.000\nselected down, and\nthen did the series dot dot dot.\n\n520\n00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.640\nIt brings you into this dialog box,\nand honestly this gets a little too,\n\n521\n00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.786\nit's got it's purpose, okay?\n\n522\n00:29:18.786 --> 00:29:21.858\nBut if I said, all right let's\ngo ahead and do a down, and\n\n523\n00:29:21.858 --> 00:29:25.690\nthen value, and then click okay,\nokay that will fill a series.\n\n524\n00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:28.270\nThere is some kind of fun\nthings like with growth.\n\n525\n00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:34.370\nHere this might be fun, two, four,\nyou know where I'm going, okay?\n\n526\n00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:38.110\nSo if I take this and\nI select down to here, and\n\n527\n00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:40.730\nthen I go Fill the Series,\nand I go with Growth,\n\n528\n00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:44.389\nwhat do you think is gonna happen?\n&gt;&gt; Well, full disclosure, Vonne,\n\n529\n00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:47.716\nI used to ask a similar question\nabout money management,\n\n530\n00:29:47.716 --> 00:29:49.446\nit's going to double.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n531\n00:29:49.446 --> 00:29:50.550\nExponents.\n\n532\n00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:53.086\nI did it with the two, and this goes 256.\n\n533\n00:29:53.086 --> 00:29:56.650\nComputers are based off of,\nall that kind of fun stuff.\n\n534\n00:29:56.650 --> 00:30:01.310\nSo you can use that dialog box with\nthe series to do some interesting things.\n\n535\n00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:04.220\nYou don't even have to have it selected,\nyou can use the drop downs.\n\n536\n00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:05.251\nPlaying around with it,\n\n537\n00:30:05.251 --> 00:30:08.204\nthat's the easiest way I would tell\nto kind of start getting used to it.\n\n538\n00:30:08.204 --> 00:30:12.372\nI'd always been just a fill handle person,\nI don't really go through to dialogue box.\n\n539\n00:30:12.372 --> 00:30:16.678\nBut I do like the Cmd D for fill down,\nand then you could also do,\n\n540\n00:30:16.678 --> 00:30:20.830\nlet's just take this, and\nmove this over for a second.\n\n541\n00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:25.390\nIf I select it out of here,\nyou can do Cmd R for right.\n\n542\n00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:29.560\nSo fill down, Cmd D, fill right, Cmd R.\n\n543\n00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.360\nSo that can be kind of fun.\n\n544\n00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:34.303\nAnd I know we're getting to\nthe very end of the episode but\n\n545\n00:30:34.303 --> 00:30:36.951\nI have just a few last little\nbits to tell you about.\n\n546\n00:30:36.951 --> 00:30:41.955\nAnd it's using the fill handle and\nthe options.\n\n547\n00:30:41.955 --> 00:30:44.275\nLet me zoom in here, okay?\n\n548\n00:30:44.275 --> 00:30:46.515\nAnd for fun, just watch for a minute.\n\n549\n00:30:46.515 --> 00:30:49.045\nI'm going to just copy and paste this.\n\n550\n00:30:49.045 --> 00:30:50.072\nJust to get some text down.\n\n551\n00:30:50.072 --> 00:30:54.255\nBut notice the formatting\nof this particular cell.\n\n552\n00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:59.460\nDifferent font, and for\nfun we'll just make it a red text.\n\n553\n00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:03.610\nSo it has a double underlines,\ntop underlines, all of that.\n\n554\n00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:07.350\nYou could also use this to fill\nformatting, which I do quite frequently.\n\n555\n00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:11.500\nWatch, if I select this it's\ngonna default to copying.\n\n556\n00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:12.230\nI don't wanna do that.\n\n557\n00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:17.434\nI wanted to keep all that text there,\nbut just use your formatting.\n\n558\n00:31:17.434 --> 00:31:18.940\nOoh, neat.\n\n559\n00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:24.166\nSo I can copy the formatting\nonly using my fill handle.\n\n560\n00:31:24.166 --> 00:31:26.010\nThat's pretty cool.\n\n561\n00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:26.870\nI like doing that.\n\n562\n00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:28.530\nI've used it quite frequently.\n\n563\n00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:31.870\nYou have to kind of remember it and\n\n564\n00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:36.150\nit just kind of had to get built\ninto your brain to use that for it.\n\n565\n00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:39.200\nSo yes, definitely check that out,\nfill handle.\n\n566\n00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.490\nOne last little thing.\n\n567\n00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:46.270\nIn a PC world,\nin this particular series for PC,\n\n568\n00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:51.100\nI also talked about this really\ncool thing called flash fill.\n\n569\n00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:53.130\nAll right, it's awesome, but\n\n570\n00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:58.490\nI don't wanna get too far down that path,\ncuz guess what?\n\n571\n00:31:58.490 --> 00:31:59.960\nIt ain't available for Mac.\n\n572\n00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.280\nYeah, I don't know when\nit's going to be available.\n\n573\n00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:06.390\nIt's really really cool though, but\nunfortunately a lot of cool things\n\n574\n00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:09.320\ncome out for the PC world and\ndoesn't translate over to Mac.\n\n575\n00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.718\nI have no clue if it ever will.\n\n576\n00:32:11.718 --> 00:32:15.789\nIt is just a really neat way to do\nwhat is known as concatenating.\n\n577\n00:32:15.789 --> 00:32:21.450\nConcatenating is taking two pieces and\nsticking them together, concatenate.\n\n578\n00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:25.571\nIf you had Vonne in one column and\nSmith in another column but\n\n579\n00:32:25.571 --> 00:32:29.702\nyou really wanted to output as\nVonne Smith in the same cell.\n\n580\n00:32:29.702 --> 00:32:33.583\nYou would then say concatenate\nthis cell with this cell and\n\n581\n00:32:33.583 --> 00:32:36.000\nit would give you the result.\n\n582\n00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.900\nSo it's just a cool way to do that and\nthen also extract.\n\n583\n00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:45.570\nSo if you see or hear about that, or\nmaybe you're watching both the Mac and\n\n584\n00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:51.370\nthe PC versions of Excel 2016 Essentials,\nGod that's such a hard thing to say,\n\n585\n00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:55.520\n[LAUGH] you're like I know that,\nit doesn't exist.\n\n586\n00:32:55.520 --> 00:33:00.103\nSo that is the end of my notes and\nhopefully you are now in just all about\n\n587\n00:33:00.103 --> 00:33:05.175\nusing the fill handle and you're gonna\ndo it and do all sorts of cool series.\n\n588\n00:33:05.175 --> 00:33:08.827\nAnd show all your friends and they're\ngonna think that you're like this magical\n\n589\n00:33:08.827 --> 00:33:11.797\nwizard of Excel.\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne, Excel registry,\n\n590\n00:33:11.797 --> 00:33:13.070\nyou had me at wizardry.\n\n591\n00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:15.770\nThat's actually really hard to say,\nand Excel.\n\n592\n00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:20.170\nThose fill handles can make your life so\nproductive and make things so fast.\n\n593\n00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:22.180\nAnd, well, speaking of fast,\nwe are out of time, so\n\n594\n00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:23.750\nwe're gonna have to\nquickly get out of here.\n\n595\n00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:26.670\nSo, signing off for OfficePro TV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n596\n00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:27.660\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n597\n00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:29.994\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see

OfficePro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.156\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison and\n\n4\n00:00:18.156 --> 00:00:22.119\nwe're continuing on with our Excel\n2016 Essentials for Mac series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:23.829\nWhew, got a little out\nof breath on that one,\n\n6\n00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:25.970\ndidn't breathe in hard\nenough before I said that.\n\n7\n00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.218\nAnd well, we're gonna come back and\nback up just a little bit and\n\n8\n00:00:29.218 --> 00:00:31.214\ntalk a little more about Field series.\n\n9\n00:00:31.214 --> 00:00:34.212\nThere's all kinds of hidden\nfeatures in Excel and luckily,\n\n10\n00:00:34.212 --> 00:00:37.340\nwe have the revealer in house\ntoday with us, Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n11\n00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.865\nHow are you doing today, Vonne?\n\n12\n00:00:37.865 --> 00:00:38.511\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing pretty good.\n\n13\n00:00:38.511 --> 00:00:39.033\nHow are you doing?\n\n14\n00:00:39.033 --> 00:00:40.860\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic.\n\n15\n00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.418\nNow, in the previous episode,\nwe talked about Field series.\n\n16\n00:00:44.418 --> 00:00:48.917\nBut it seems like there's a little more to\nthem than we had in just that one episode,\n\n17\n00:00:48.917 --> 00:00:49.910\nso we're back.\n\n18\n00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:50.863\nWhat else do we have to talk about?\n\n19\n00:00:50.863 --> 00:00:55.557\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you say I'm the revealer, yeah I\nreveal that I totally forgot something to\n\n20\n00:00:55.557 --> 00:01:00.430\ntell you all, so [LAUGH] yes, I wanted to\ncome back and talk about custom lists.\n\n21\n00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.460\nSo we talked about what\nis a fill series and\n\n22\n00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.477\nwent over all the different\nthings that the fill handle does.\n\n23\n00:01:05.477 --> 00:01:09.340\nAnd actually, why don't we just\ngo ahead and jump right in.\n\n24\n00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.178\nLet's get started and\nget back into our navigator workbook, so\n\n25\n00:01:13.178 --> 00:01:16.744\nI can demonstrate as we do\na quick review about everything.\n\n26\n00:01:16.744 --> 00:01:20.890\nSo I have our navigator workbook, Network.\n\n27\n00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.461\nYeah, navigate workbook, sorry that's\non my notes and I have worksheet.\n\n28\n00:01:24.461 --> 00:01:26.590\nI think that's just a typo on my part.\n\n29\n00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.394\nI just need some content right here.\n\n30\n00:01:28.394 --> 00:01:31.389\nSo if I have this particular\npart right here or this content,\n\n31\n00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:34.870\nwe talked about the little black\nplus sign, meaning our fill handle.\n\n32\n00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.161\nAnd it's primary job, is to copy.\n\n33\n00:01:36.161 --> 00:01:39.040\nSo that means we go ahead and fill down.\n\n34\n00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.293\nBut we also talked about those\nkeywords if you wanna talk about.\n\n35\n00:01:43.293 --> 00:01:47.530\nWhere we talked at how\nto do sequential dates.\n\n36\n00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.291\nLike if I typed in 3-1-18,\nand then went ahead and\n\n37\n00:01:51.291 --> 00:01:54.824\npulled that down,\nit's gonna see that as a series.\n\n38\n00:01:54.824 --> 00:01:59.153\nOr even if I added it with text,\nif I said invoice and\n\n39\n00:01:59.153 --> 00:02:04.990\nwe'll say number one, pull that down,\nit sees that as a series.\n\n40\n00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.072\nAnd then of course, we talked about\nthose different options down here.\n\n41\n00:02:07.072 --> 00:02:10.010\nLet me actually move my\nscreen up a little bit.\n\n42\n00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:11.962\nMaybe zoom out just a little bit.\n\n43\n00:02:11.962 --> 00:02:16.316\nSo, we've talked about different options\nwe have with whether you want to copy or\n\n44\n00:02:16.316 --> 00:02:17.400\ndo the fill series.\n\n45\n00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.263\nSo, all those things that we\ncovered in that previous episode.\n\n46\n00:02:21.263 --> 00:02:25.140\nThen the one thing we did\ntalked about was the dates.\n\n47\n00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.675\nNot the dates, I'm sorry,\nthe months of the year.\n\n48\n00:02:27.675 --> 00:02:29.970\nYes, and the days of the week.\n\n49\n00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.498\nThey're almost like trigger words,\nweren't they?\n\n50\n00:02:32.498 --> 00:02:37.461\nIt's like if I typed in the word Mon,\nlike an abbreviation for Monday,\n\n51\n00:02:37.461 --> 00:02:43.210\nand I pulled this down, it just knew\nthat those were the days of the week.\n\n52\n00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.185\nSame with the months of the year.\n\n53\n00:02:44.185 --> 00:02:46.300\nWell, how does it know that?\n\n54\n00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.029\nWhere is that coming from?\n\n55\n00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:51.800\nThat's the part I totally forgot\nto tell you all about, is that,\n\n56\n00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.370\nthis is coming from what's\nknown as custom lists.\n\n57\n00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.069\nThis is a list of entries that\nis stored within the Excel\n\n58\n00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.471\nprogram that we are triggering\none of those words.\n\n59\n00:03:04.471 --> 00:03:08.450\nAnd it's just letting us go ahead and\nfill in that series.\n\n60\n00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.817\nAnd we also talked about how we could\ntype in, let's do June for the month.\n\n61\n00:03:14.817 --> 00:03:18.520\nAnd then it finds, whoops, let's go\nahead and get the fill handle there.\n\n62\n00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.172\nIt finds that within that series, or that\nlist, and then goes ahead and fills down.\n\n63\n00:03:24.172 --> 00:03:28.570\nOkay, well,\nI wanna show you where they are.\n\n64\n00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.318\nAnd then talk about creating your own,\nwhich can be kind of fun.\n\n65\n00:03:31.318 --> 00:03:33.366\nAnd can be really handy for\n\n66\n00:03:33.366 --> 00:03:39.152\nyou to input information that may be you\ndo a lot of, and so on and so forth.\n\n67\n00:03:39.152 --> 00:03:41.430\nSo let me show you where it's at first.\n\n68\n00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.551\nI'm gonna zoom out first for\na little bit so I can see this.\n\n69\n00:03:43.551 --> 00:03:46.340\nIt's up in our Excel\nmenu up in our Menu bar.\n\n70\n00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.135\nAnd we're going into our Preferences.\n\n71\n00:03:48.135 --> 00:03:51.380\nSo from our Preferences,\nit says right there in the middle.\n\n72\n00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.535\nIt says manage the lists.\n\n73\n00:03:52.535 --> 00:03:53.760\nWhat does that say, sorry.\n\n74\n00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.850\n[LAUGH] I never actually\nread this tool tip before.\n\n75\n00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.090\nManage the list that you create\nto automatically fill cells or\n\n76\n00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.470\nsort data in unique ways.\n\n77\n00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.818\nThere's another,\nthere was another sentence in there.\n\n78\n00:04:04.818 --> 00:04:09.463\nOkay, for example a custom list can be\nused to store a list of executives by job\n\n79\n00:04:09.463 --> 00:04:13.103\ntitle starting with the president,\nvice president etc.\n\n80\n00:04:13.103 --> 00:04:14.224\nWow, that's a great example.\n\n81\n00:04:14.224 --> 00:04:15.590\nOkay, cool.\n\n82\n00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.751\nSo this is where, I already have a couple\nbecause I was playing around with it..\n\n83\n00:04:19.751 --> 00:04:24.009\nSo you know, let's just do the,\nturn your eyes away for a minute and\n\n84\n00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:28.730\nlet me just show you how those are not\ngoing to be there to begin with.\n\n85\n00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.960\nAnd as you can see,\nI can delete a list right there, so.\n\n86\n00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.769\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne, does that mean despite the\nones that we shouldn't see, the ones that\n\n87\n00:04:35.769 --> 00:04:40.780\nare there when you open this, will that\nbe seen at the time of this recording?\n\n88\n00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.016\nBy everybody else will see Sunday,\nMonday, Tuesday as abbreviations, and\n\n89\n00:04:44.016 --> 00:04:46.279\nthen January, February,\nMarch as abbreviations.\n\n90\n00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:47.640\nAnd [INAUDIBLE] are for those list?\n\n91\n00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.307\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yes.\nAnd\n\n92\n00:04:48.307 --> 00:04:52.430\nthose are the ones that we had\nbeen demonstrating before.\n\n93\n00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.990\nI was like hey, if I typed in a word June,\nit's in this particular list right here.\n\n94\n00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.324\nIf I typed in MON, it was finding this.\n\n95\n00:05:01.324 --> 00:05:05.899\nAnd so, these are the predetermined\nlists that come with\n\n96\n00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:10.350\nExcel when you purchase it and\ndownload the product.\n\n97\n00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.256\nSo yeah, the ones that you saw me delete,\n\n98\n00:05:12.256 --> 00:05:15.871\nobviously you wouldn't have a list with\nFuego and Bishop and everybody else.\n\n99\n00:05:15.871 --> 00:05:18.290\nBut [LAUGH] I was playing around.\n\n100\n00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:19.638\nWell, prep them for this episode.\n\n101\n00:05:19.638 --> 00:05:22.375\n&gt;&gt; Well Vonne, I don't know about you, I\nactually have those, I'm looking at them.\n\n102\n00:05:22.375 --> 00:05:23.348\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm joking.\n\n103\n00:05:23.348 --> 00:05:28.200\nBut I do want to put\na fine point on something.\n\n104\n00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.969\nWe saw that 3/1/18, 3/2/18.\n\n105\n00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:32.766\nIf you have something that's numeric,\n\n106\n00:05:32.766 --> 00:05:36.480\nis it possible that I could\nput those as a custom list?\n\n107\n00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.993\nBut probably not what I want to, because\nI can actually create relationships.\n\n108\n00:05:39.993 --> 00:05:44.330\nOr the relationship is kind of just\nassumed based on those numbers?\n\n109\n00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.623\n&gt;&gt; Yeah the number thing is an automatic\nfeature of the fill series.\n\n110\n00:05:47.623 --> 00:05:52.380\nAnd what you're talking about was\nthe iterations or the sequence.\n\n111\n00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.553\nLike we typed in five and ten,\nslashed them both and then it did it,\n\n112\n00:05:55.553 --> 00:05:56.466\ncounted by fives.\n\n113\n00:05:56.466 --> 00:05:59.580\nSo that is something yet\nyou can determine the pattern.\n\n114\n00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.552\nWe did have, we ran in someone was like,\nI don't know exactly what it's doing.\n\n115\n00:06:03.552 --> 00:06:10.650\nSo, I guess in theory, could you create\na custom list that had numbers in it?\n\n116\n00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.049\nSure, you can.\n\n117\n00:06:12.049 --> 00:06:16.970\nIt's just if you do have sequences that\nyou don't really need to add that in.\n\n118\n00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.998\n&gt;&gt; And I would even further say,\nI'll take a little bit different opinion.\n\n119\n00:06:19.998 --> 00:06:23.704\nIf you add numbers, there's probably\na pre-existing relationship that you can\n\n120\n00:06:23.704 --> 00:06:25.620\nuse to generate further numbers.\n\n121\n00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.246\nThan just a finite list that you would\nhave to type in as we've seen here, right.\n\n122\n00:06:29.246 --> 00:06:34.600\nYou don't wanna type in everyday of\nthe year as like, 3/1, 3/2, 3/3.\n\n123\n00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.601\nWell, how does those works?\n\n124\n00:06:35.601 --> 00:06:40.086\nWell, those are just dates, they're\ndates that can go from one to 31, and\n\n125\n00:06:40.086 --> 00:06:42.380\nthen they just kind of repeat.\n\n126\n00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.011\nAnd you can create relationships\nbased on their numeric patterns.\n\n127\n00:06:45.011 --> 00:06:46.260\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely.\n\n128\n00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.321\nSo, now when you have your custom list,\n\n129\n00:06:49.321 --> 00:06:52.752\nthis is where you can create your own,\nokay?\n\n130\n00:06:52.752 --> 00:06:56.388\nLike my example that I've always\ngiven maybe just if you can\n\n131\n00:06:56.388 --> 00:06:59.580\nrelate to this is like,\nhey I've got a semester.\n\n132\n00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:00.821\nI've got these particular students.\n\n133\n00:07:00.821 --> 00:07:03.380\nAnd I'm always going to put\nthem in alphabetical order.\n\n134\n00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:09.662\nSo we start at Aubrey and then that's my\ntrigger word and I pull on down to Zach.\n\n135\n00:07:09.662 --> 00:07:13.530\nAnd that I just had those and\nthat's my list of students.\n\n136\n00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:18.276\nSo another one I would always talk\nabout was counties within Florida.\n\n137\n00:07:18.276 --> 00:07:22.133\nThe 57,\nhowever counties there are in Florida,\n\n138\n00:07:22.133 --> 00:07:27.440\nstarts with Alachua and goes down to,\nDaniel and I talked about this.\n\n139\n00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.183\nThere's like a Wallawoochie or\nsome weird W.\n\n140\n00:07:30.183 --> 00:07:33.170\n&gt;&gt; You are asking a non-native Floridian.\n\n141\n00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:37.264\nI barely know the county\nthat we live in together,\n\n142\n00:07:37.264 --> 00:07:40.288\nmuch less all of the other 50 plus.\n\n143\n00:07:40.288 --> 00:07:41.760\nI'm non-committal.\n\n144\n00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.380\nI know it's somewhere in there.\n\n145\n00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.418\n&gt;&gt; How would you look it up?\n\n146\n00:07:45.418 --> 00:07:45.918\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n147\n00:07:45.918 --> 00:07:47.736\n&gt;&gt; I'm on it, you continue,\n\n148\n00:07:47.736 --> 00:07:48.916\ncontinue.\n&gt;&gt; Keep talking, yeah.\n\n149\n00:07:48.916 --> 00:07:50.690\nI think it ends with Washington.\n\n150\n00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.124\nBut that's only because I've\ndone this in the PC series and\n\n151\n00:07:53.124 --> 00:07:54.834\nwe talked about this exact same subject.\n\n152\n00:07:54.834 --> 00:07:58.340\nBut that's something that works\nin the country administration or\n\n153\n00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.130\nin the State of Florida.\n\n154\n00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:03.320\nYou might have to populate a whole\nlist of counties in Florida.\n\n155\n00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.210\nWhy not make it a custom list?\n\n156\n00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:09.109\nCuz that way you can just do\na lot to have pull on them.\n\n157\n00:08:09.109 --> 00:08:11.190\nAnd so that's something to think about.\n\n158\n00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.836\nWe're gonna make a small list and\ndid you find at the counties?\n\n159\n00:08:13.836 --> 00:08:15.909\n&gt;&gt; I did, there were 67 of them.\n\n160\n00:08:15.909 --> 00:08:18.121\n&gt;&gt; Hey, I got the seven, right?\n\n161\n00:08:18.121 --> 00:08:18.646\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n162\n00:08:18.646 --> 00:08:21.225\nWashington County is the very last one.\n\n163\n00:08:21.225 --> 00:08:24.675\nThere's a Walton and\na Wakula or Wackula County.\n\n164\n00:08:24.675 --> 00:08:26.320\n&gt;&gt; That was the one.\n\n165\n00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.046\n&gt;&gt; Those are fun, and\nwell, the more you know,\n\n166\n00:08:28.046 --> 00:08:30.378\nthat's a just a little added extra for\nthe bank for your but.\n\n167\n00:08:30.378 --> 00:08:32.692\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But, instead of making this largely,\n\n168\n00:08:32.692 --> 00:08:35.470\nlet's just say we're gonna\nbuild like smaller list.\n\n169\n00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:36.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're just gonna, for an example.\n\n170\n00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:39.551\nOkay, so, we're gonna start with,\nhey, let's go ahead and\n\n171\n00:08:39.551 --> 00:08:41.510\ntype in some of our host, right?\n\n172\n00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:42.627\nSo why don't, you know what?\nGuess what Justin?\n\n173\n00:08:42.627 --> 00:08:45.400\nYou're gonna start the list, uh-hm.\n\n174\n00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:50.323\nSo we have Justin as our first one, and\nnow notice that down here at the bottom,\n\n175\n00:08:50.323 --> 00:08:53.697\npress return to separate list values,\nokay, cool.\n\n176\n00:08:53.697 --> 00:08:55.670\nSo I will hit Enter.\n\n177\n00:08:55.670 --> 00:09:01.171\nAnd then I will hit, we'll talk Mike and\nthen we have Daniel and then we have me.\n\n178\n00:09:01.171 --> 00:09:04.362\nAnd then we have Zach,\noops that's not how you spell it.\n\n179\n00:09:04.362 --> 00:09:08.436\nAnd then we have Cherokee, and we have-\n&gt;&gt; Adam.\n\n180\n00:09:08.436 --> 00:09:13.980\n&gt;&gt; Adam, whow can forget Ronnie,\nhe's on t-shirt, Don.\n\n181\n00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.573\n&gt;&gt; Wes.\n&gt;&gt; Wes, it's just right in front of me,\n\n182\n00:09:19.573 --> 00:09:24.380\nthat kind of stuff and\nyeah, so we're good.\n\n183\n00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.318\nBrand new, very exciting.\n\n184\n00:09:26.318 --> 00:09:28.014\nIf I may say, I'm very sorry.\n\n185\n00:09:28.014 --> 00:09:29.340\nI work with you every day.\n\n186\n00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.031\nLove ya.\nSo now, if I want to go ahead and\n\n187\n00:09:31.031 --> 00:09:34.650\nadd this, I just click add,\nand then there's my list.\n\n188\n00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:35.645\nPerfect, okay, cool.\n\n189\n00:09:35.645 --> 00:09:39.883\nSo now, if I click this, close, and now,\nI could go ahead and start with Justin,\n\n190\n00:09:39.883 --> 00:09:42.620\n'cause he was the one that I triggered.\n\n191\n00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.517\nIt does make a difference\non how you type it in.\n\n192\n00:09:45.517 --> 00:09:48.305\nBecause if I typed in Justin and\n\n193\n00:09:48.305 --> 00:09:53.580\nI pulled this down all the way down to,\noops,there is Jo.\n\n194\n00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.645\nIt is in the exact order that I wrote it,\nokay?\n\n195\n00:09:56.645 --> 00:10:00.569\nIf I type in Daniel here and\nthen pull down,\n\n196\n00:10:00.569 --> 00:10:07.910\nnotice that it starts from wherever it\nwas in that list, kind of like arrays.\n\n197\n00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:09.550\nAnd this is the position\nyou're going to start in.\n\n198\n00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:12.420\nYou see, you've been paying\nattention in your Dev Pros though.\n\n199\n00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.416\nAnd so that's where it's gonna know.\n\n200\n00:10:13.416 --> 00:10:15.700\nNow, of course,\nyou can sort it afterwards.\n\n201\n00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.876\nBut just know that before you type it in,\nit's the order it will fill down.\n\n202\n00:10:18.876 --> 00:10:24.180\nSo Vonne, I'd like to think of this\nas lay them out on a clock face.\n\n203\n00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:26.762\nSo the list, you kind of bend\nthem around on a clock face and\n\n204\n00:10:26.762 --> 00:10:28.411\nthen you start at 12 and go around.\n\n205\n00:10:28.411 --> 00:10:31.533\nYou're just turning the clock face\naround and that's where you start, and\n\n206\n00:10:31.533 --> 00:10:33.190\nyou always cycle back around.\n\n207\n00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:37.049\nBecause all of these lists it appears,\ndo have a cyclic nature to them.\n\n208\n00:10:37.049 --> 00:10:41.153\nAnd if you always think about I'll start\nat the top and rotate back around then\n\n209\n00:10:41.153 --> 00:10:45.722\nwherever you start is just like rotating\nthe clock and that becomes your 12:00.\n\n210\n00:10:45.722 --> 00:10:49.754\n&gt;&gt; That's an amazing analogy,\nI've never use that and guess what,\n\n211\n00:10:49.754 --> 00:10:51.564\nI'm gonna use that from now.\n\n212\n00:10:51.564 --> 00:10:53.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's a great way to explain it.\n\n213\n00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:56.551\nSo I'm like yeah, it's just whatever\nit is in the list and it just goes.\n\n214\n00:10:56.551 --> 00:10:59.790\nYour explanation is quite better so\nthank you for that [LAUGH].\n\n215\n00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:03.032\nI am going to take that and\nmove on, so [LAUGH].\n\n216\n00:11:03.032 --> 00:11:03.652\nAwesome.\n\n217\n00:11:03.652 --> 00:11:09.065\nThe thing that you kind of touched on\nit or maybe I just kind of interpreted\n\n218\n00:11:09.065 --> 00:11:13.945\nthat you did, is that you do have\nto be little careful about making\n\n219\n00:11:13.945 --> 00:11:18.780\nlists that have the same trigger word,\nif you wanna say, okay?\n\n220\n00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:21.705\nSo we have our hosts, right?\n\n221\n00:11:21.705 --> 00:11:25.767\nSo if I went ahead and\nwent into our preferences and\n\n222\n00:11:25.767 --> 00:11:30.604\nwent under our custom lists again,\nand I make another one,\n\n223\n00:11:30.604 --> 00:11:33.720\nnow, what if I start with me, right?\n\n224\n00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.755\nSo maybe I go ahead and\nput my name in the list.\n\n225\n00:11:35.755 --> 00:11:40.304\nLets go ahead and put in, I will put\nin Terry and Fuego and we'll go in,\n\n226\n00:11:40.304 --> 00:11:42.590\nBishop, our little family.\n\n227\n00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:47.574\nSo I have added this over into my list but\nnow the thing\n\n228\n00:11:47.574 --> 00:11:52.570\nis I have two lists that\nhave the same entry,right?\n\n229\n00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:54.620\nI'm in this list and I'm in this list.\n\n230\n00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:56.882\nSo what's gonna happen?\n\n231\n00:11:56.882 --> 00:12:00.740\nBy the last time, I'm pointing at\nmy screen like you guys can see.\n\n232\n00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.360\nIf I was in this list before I typed\nin my other one, I put my name in,\n\n233\n00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.431\nit would go the next, Zack,\nCherokee, Adam, right.\n\n234\n00:12:07.431 --> 00:12:11.848\nWhat would happen when I go ahead and type\nmy name in this time and then I pull down?\n\n235\n00:12:11.848 --> 00:12:15.314\nWell, who won?\n\n236\n00:12:15.314 --> 00:12:20.530\nWhy did it pull the family list\nrather than the host list?\n\n237\n00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:21.437\nAny guesses, Justin?\n\n238\n00:12:21.437 --> 00:12:22.848\n&gt;&gt; So I think I have a guess.\n\n239\n00:12:22.848 --> 00:12:27.291\nIs it because yours is further\nnear the beginning of the list in\n\n240\n00:12:27.291 --> 00:12:31.660\nthat list than the other one,\neven though they're shared?\n\n241\n00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:35.020\n&gt;&gt; You know what?\nI didn't think of it that way.\n\n242\n00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.226\n[LAUGH] I'm pretty sure not,\nbut you know what?\n\n243\n00:12:38.226 --> 00:12:39.409\nLet's try.\n\n244\n00:12:39.409 --> 00:12:40.718\nSorry, I was just there.\n\n245\n00:12:40.718 --> 00:12:42.570\nWhy don't we try this?\n\n246\n00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:44.375\nWhy don't we do a Justin?\n\n247\n00:12:44.375 --> 00:12:46.430\nWhat's your dog's name?\n\n248\n00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:47.697\nI know you have dogs.\n\n249\n00:12:47.697 --> 00:12:49.116\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna embarass me now.\n\n250\n00:12:49.116 --> 00:12:51.629\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Wrinkles.\n\n251\n00:12:51.629 --> 00:12:53.467\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Frisky.\n\n252\n00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:56.130\nWith the y?\n\n253\n00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:57.032\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n254\n00:12:57.032 --> 00:12:57.597\n&gt;&gt; Aurora?\n\n255\n00:12:57.597 --> 00:12:59.701\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n256\n00:12:59.701 --> 00:13:00.836\n&gt;&gt; Aurora.\n\n257\n00:13:00.836 --> 00:13:01.862\n&gt;&gt; And Texas.\n\n258\n00:13:01.862 --> 00:13:05.042\n&gt;&gt; Look at that, I have those names,\nthose are adorable.\n\n259\n00:13:05.042 --> 00:13:08.406\n[LAUGH] So because you're first\nin this list too, aren't you?\n\n260\n00:13:08.406 --> 00:13:13.240\nOkay, so let's test this cuz I actually\nhaven't tested it in this sense.\n\n261\n00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.524\nSo here we go, Justin.\n\n262\n00:13:18.302 --> 00:13:18.967\nNow your dogs.\n\n263\n00:13:18.967 --> 00:13:23.998\nSo I'm pretty sure, I'm 98% sure that\n\n264\n00:13:23.998 --> 00:13:30.120\nwhat is like the last list\nthat we added was here.\n\n265\n00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.095\nSo it's like overwriting the first one.\n\n266\n00:13:32.095 --> 00:13:38.750\nThe same way as me being in the middle of\nthe Host list, I'm now on the top of it.\n\n267\n00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:42.915\nAnd so it's not necessarily the placement\nof, this is the first entry in the list,\n\n268\n00:13:42.915 --> 00:13:44.831\nI think it's the storage of where is.\n\n269\n00:13:44.831 --> 00:13:49.720\nNow the only thing I can't test\nis l can't move them up and down.\n\n270\n00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.566\nLike in the order, but it's almost like\nit's the last thing that was entered into\n\n271\n00:13:53.566 --> 00:13:55.360\nthis, so that's what it remembers.\n\n272\n00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.320\nIt's almost like a copy and paste thing.\n\n273\n00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:02.376\nIt's like what was last left on\nthe clipboard and it fills that space.\n\n274\n00:14:02.376 --> 00:14:06.340\nI can't 100% attune to that,\nbut in our test.\n\n275\n00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.321\n&gt;&gt; It's kinda like if you\neat a lot of pancakes.\n\n276\n00:14:08.321 --> 00:14:12.026\nThe last pancake on the stack\nis the first pancake you eat, so\n\n277\n00:14:12.026 --> 00:14:14.870\nthat's probably a good\nway to remember that.\n\n278\n00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:15.810\n&gt;&gt; Man, another analogy to remember.\n\n279\n00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:19.909\nJust file away, tuck in my little, hey,\nwhen I'm gonna talk about custom lists,\n\n280\n00:14:19.909 --> 00:14:22.490\nI'm gonna remember Justin's analogies.\n\n281\n00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:23.009\nYeah, exactly.\n\n282\n00:14:23.009 --> 00:14:25.400\nSo, that's what I'm seeing.\n\n283\n00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.099\nAnd that's what I'm gonna go with\nbecause that's what it's showing us.\n\n284\n00:14:28.099 --> 00:14:30.540\nSo, wonderful, so there you go.\n\n285\n00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:34.001\nSo now we have all of Justin's dogs,\nI have me and my cats.\n\n286\n00:14:34.001 --> 00:14:37.700\nWell, I guess, Terry is not my case.\n\n287\n00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.174\n[LAUGH] So we've got this different ones,\nand there we go.\n\n288\n00:14:40.174 --> 00:14:44.280\nSo that's just something that,\nwhat I think it wins.\n\n289\n00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:49.227\nSo just be careful of that when\nyou have items of the same entry\n\n290\n00:14:49.227 --> 00:14:52.916\nin multiple list,\nit can cause some issues.\n\n291\n00:14:52.916 --> 00:14:56.738\nLast thing I just wanna\nthrow out really quickly,\n\n292\n00:14:56.738 --> 00:15:01.760\nwas that we were individually\ntyping in those entries right?\n\n293\n00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:05.387\nSaying like basically typing Mike,\nJustin, Ronnie all that stuff.\n\n294\n00:15:05.387 --> 00:15:07.792\nBut I have a list right here,\nwhat if like hey,\n\n295\n00:15:07.792 --> 00:15:11.400\nthis is here's a list of all\nof my counties and whatnot.\n\n296\n00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.167\nWell, I could import them\nin instead of typing them,\n\n297\n00:15:14.167 --> 00:15:15.958\nif they're already written out.\n\n298\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:19.816\nSo, in case you were wondering, and\nyou saw when we went into our custom list,\n\n299\n00:15:19.816 --> 00:15:22.240\nthere's this little button down here.\n\n300\n00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:27.100\nSo then, it's just saying hey go ahead and\nimport a list from the cells.\n\n301\n00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:33.800\nYou put your flashing cursor in this text\nbox, you can click this button, okay?\n\n302\n00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.123\nThat's totally fine.\n\n303\n00:15:35.123 --> 00:15:38.615\nOr if you just take your mouse\nout into your worksheets, so\n\n304\n00:15:38.615 --> 00:15:41.400\nyou don't even have to close anything.\n\n305\n00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:45.699\nYou just click, hold, and drag, and\nI'm just gonna go down to Kimba for now.\n\n306\n00:15:45.699 --> 00:15:48.182\nAnd so it's bringing all of those in,\n\n307\n00:15:48.182 --> 00:15:51.990\nthe dollar signs are indication\nof absolute references.\n\n308\n00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:53.292\nDon't worry about that for right now.\n\n309\n00:15:53.292 --> 00:15:57.071\nYou just select the cells,\nyou click the Import button and\n\n310\n00:15:57.071 --> 00:15:59.310\nnotice it just brings all in.\n\n311\n00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:02.405\nThey are separated by\nEnter marks in here and\n\n312\n00:16:02.405 --> 00:16:07.436\nit was all ready entered into your list,\nlike you don't have to add it.\n\n313\n00:16:07.436 --> 00:16:09.260\nIt's just one last step.\n\n314\n00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:13.337\nSo it's something if it's all ready\nwritten out that you don't have to retype\n\n315\n00:16:13.337 --> 00:16:14.404\nit and everything.\n\n316\n00:16:14.404 --> 00:16:16.740\nOne lasts little thing.\n\n317\n00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:19.298\nIf you're coming over from the PC world,\n\n318\n00:16:19.298 --> 00:16:22.523\nI know that PC world you can\nalso put in a semicolons.\n\n319\n00:16:22.523 --> 00:16:26.948\nSo if you had, like a list that was a\ndelimiter that we talked about in the next\n\n320\n00:16:26.948 --> 00:16:29.940\nepisode, we're going to\ntalk about a file types.\n\n321\n00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:33.362\nYou can do that.\nIt seems that with Mac,\n\n322\n00:16:33.362 --> 00:16:35.550\nit does like the n term.\n\n323\n00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:38.782\nI cannot verify right now cuz now I just\nthought about it like well, what if you\n\n324\n00:16:38.782 --> 00:16:42.396\nwent ahead and copied it with semicolons,\nwould it automatically change to enters?\n\n325\n00:16:42.396 --> 00:16:43.420\nI don't know.\n\n326\n00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.964\nSo I'd probably just go ahead and\nstick with returns or\n\n327\n00:16:45.964 --> 00:16:48.581\nenters to do your separations and\nthen it's your work.\n\n328\n00:16:48.581 --> 00:16:50.820\nBut try it with semicolon, did it work?\n\n329\n00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.667\nGreat, if not, now you know.\n\n330\n00:16:52.667 --> 00:16:55.892\nThere you go and that's everything\nI think I wanted to cover.\n\n331\n00:16:55.892 --> 00:16:59.341\nThey are just the last little bits of the\nthings I forgot to tell you in the other\n\n332\n00:16:59.341 --> 00:16:59.884\nepisodes.\n\n333\n00:16:59.884 --> 00:17:02.120\nSo, make all your custom lists.\n\n334\n00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:06.509\nYou know that we have 67 counties in the\nstate of Florida starting with Alachua and\n\n335\n00:17:06.509 --> 00:17:07.959\ngoing down to Washington.\n\n336\n00:17:07.959 --> 00:17:09.420\nThe more you know.\n\n337\n00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:10.601\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\nthank you so much, Yvonne.\n\n338\n00:17:10.601 --> 00:17:13.321\nYou have definitely shown us\na little hidden gem there that\n\n339\n00:17:13.321 --> 00:17:15.310\ncan make your life more productive.\n\n340\n00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:16.834\nBut be careful, don't go crazy.\n\n341\n00:17:16.834 --> 00:17:20.624\nAlways keep in context, does this\nmake sense to have a custom list or\n\n342\n00:17:20.624 --> 00:17:22.515\nshould I just figure out.\n\n343\n00:17:22.515 --> 00:17:26.806\nDo the sequence in series actually make\nmy life easier instead of typing in 700\n\n344\n00:17:26.806 --> 00:17:27.316\nvalues?\n\n345\n00:17:27.316 --> 00:17:30.205\nSo, always keep that in\nmind as you use these.\n\n346\n00:17:30.205 --> 00:17:32.669\nAnd well, keep in mind that we got\nmore Excel coming at you, but for\n\n347\n00:17:32.669 --> 00:17:34.353\nnow we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n348\n00:17:34.353 --> 00:17:37.399\nSo signing off for Office Pro TV,\nI've been your host Justin Nenson.\n\n349\n00:17:37.399 --> 00:17:38.535\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n350\n00:17:38.535 --> 00:17:39.458\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n351\n00:17:39.458 --> 00:17:46.259\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

I'm doing pretty good, how are you?\n\n9\n00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.630\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic and\n\n10\n00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.260\nthis is actually a thing that I've used\non my own in other capacities, right?\n\n11\n00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.830\nMaybe not with Office products,\nbut I have had to open Excel,\n\n12\n00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.540\nexported this something else in order\nto do an additional operation on it.\n\n13\n00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:55.290\nSo what are we ultimately care about\nwhen we're exporting things from Excel?\n\n14\n00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.140\n&gt;&gt; Yes, where we're going to go.\n\n15\n00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.590\nWhat is my intention for,\nmaybe somebody like you, or somebody else,\n\n16\n00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.880\nthat they don't have Excel.\n\n17\n00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.160\nOr I need to get this\ninformation into a different\n\n18\n00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.380\nlanguage if you wanna say for\nanother product, or\n\n19\n00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.450\nan application, or a database, or\nsomething for it to be able to read, okay?\n\n20\n00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.640\nCuz you can really think of file\ntypes just like languages, okay?\n\n21\n00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.790\nSo Excel talks in Excel,\nWord talks in Word.\n\n22\n00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.310\nWell, those are what are called\nproprietary file types and\n\n23\n00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.360\nso you have to have Excel\nto translate an Excel file.\n\n24\n00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.180\nSame with Word and so on and so forth.\n\n25\n00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.690\nBut there are file types\nthat are more universal\n\n26\n00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.400\nwhere anybody, if you wanna say,\nor anything can read it.\n\n27\n00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.180\nBecause it is in a non-proprietary format,\nit's really just text.\n\n28\n00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.730\nAnd computers can read text, but\n\n29\n00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.140\nhow you structure that text will\nallow Excel like programs or\n\n30\n00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.920\nany other type of programs that are very\nspecific to be able to read it and\n\n31\n00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.080\nthen say, I know what you're\ntalking about and then we go there.\n\n32\n00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:12.871\nSo we're gonna talk about the all\nimportant CSV file format.\n\n33\n00:02:12.871 --> 00:02:19.140\nNow CSV, I think I know you know\nthe answer to what does CSV stand for?\n\n34\n00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.230\n&gt;&gt; This is something that\nhas helped me a great deal.\n\n35\n00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.550\nI used to do a little bit\nof data processing and\n\n36\n00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.450\na little bit of data merging\nif that is what we'd call it.\n\n37\n00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.920\nAnd part of that is I need to\ntake data here and here and\n\n38\n00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.130\nput it together, and In order to do that\neffectively, efficiently, expeditiously.\n\n39\n00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.500\nI just wanted to use a bunch of u words,\nwe had to do that programatically, okay?\n\n40\n00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.990\nExcel, gets a little weird,\nyou can't you do have VBA and macros and\n\n41\n00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.060\nthings like that.\n\n42\n00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.130\nHowever, we would take\nExcel spreadsheets and\n\n43\n00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.670\nwe would export them to CSVs or\ncomma, separated values.\n\n44\n00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.820\nWhere now, I can read this in and\nI can make some assumptions.\n\n45\n00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:05.320\nFor every comma, that's a new column,\nfor every new line, I get a new row.\n\n46\n00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.320\nAnd because we made use of that,\nit made our lives easier.\n\n47\n00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.280\nWith one caveat,\n\n48\n00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.880\nif someone else sent me a CSV, it seems\nsimple, but there are ways to mess it up.\n\n49\n00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.590\nSo it's a little bit of horror and\njoy at the same time when you're like,\n\n50\n00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.170\nI got a CSV, I can do stuff with it.\n\n51\n00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.445\nAnd then you try to do stuff with it,\nand it's broke, but\n\n52\n00:03:25.445 --> 00:03:28.855\nif it comes out of Excel,\nit's usually formatted appropriately.\n\n53\n00:03:28.855 --> 00:03:31.455\nSo, kind of interested to\nsee how this works out.\n\n54\n00:03:31.455 --> 00:03:32.955\n&gt;&gt; I like how you said usually.\n\n55\n00:03:32.955 --> 00:03:35.050\nWell, guess what, it doesn't always work.\n\n56\n00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.772\n[LAUGH] And I am living proof\nof it doesn't work sometimes.\n\n57\n00:03:40.772 --> 00:03:44.167\nAnd I'm gonna show you how to do it, but\nI thought that was a great explanation of\n\n58\n00:03:44.167 --> 00:03:46.360\nthe commas separating where\nthe columns and rows.\n\n59\n00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.842\nSo, why don't we do this?\n\n60\n00:03:47.842 --> 00:03:53.002\nWhy don't we start off by, instead of\nhow we're going to export out of Excel,\n\n61\n00:03:53.002 --> 00:03:58.200\nlet's look at a CSV file\nin its text format and\n\n62\n00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.620\nthen we'll talk about how we can\nget Excel to make it that way.\n\n63\n00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.600\nSo let's jump on down here,\nI have some files that we've got.\n\n64\n00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.899\nNow notice in here that I have got\nour Department and Address, but\n\n65\n00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:10.570\nI have it in three different file types.\n\n66\n00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.953\nI have it in Excel XLSX,\nthe older version of Excel,\n\n67\n00:04:14.953 --> 00:04:18.939\nthe XLS,\nwe talked about those file formats and\n\n68\n00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:24.736\nthe progression of it in our introduction,\nand then we have our CSV.\n\n69\n00:04:24.736 --> 00:04:27.777\nThey all look like they are associated,\nwell maybe not this one,\n\n70\n00:04:27.777 --> 00:04:31.760\nthe icon in this one's a little off, but\ndon't worry about that one too much.\n\n71\n00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.420\nBut this looks like an Excel icon,\nso it's like, well, wait a second.\n\n72\n00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.020\nBut this is a CSV file.\n\n73\n00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.900\nWell, that's because Excel is\na program that can read this and so\n\n74\n00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.120\nit is associating itself to\nthis particular file types.\n\n75\n00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.370\nI believe it's called a mime, M-I-M-E, of\n\n76\n00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.330\nwhat your computer sees as that language\nand then what program it opens up.\n\n77\n00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.760\nFor example, my PDF, since I have\nAdobe Acrobat, it's gonna open in Acrobat.\n\n78\n00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.100\nBut on a Mac, if you don't have Acrobat,\nit's gonna open in Preview.\n\n79\n00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.064\nSo that's where it's just kinda mapping\nwhat programs open up what file types.\n\n80\n00:05:07.064 --> 00:05:09.960\nAnd this is one you've, if you ever\nhad a file type it doesn't understand.\n\n81\n00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.050\nIt gives you like, I don't know what this\nis, and I can't find a program to open it.\n\n82\n00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nsometimes your computer will shrug.\n\n83\n00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.888\nAnd I think what's really annoying if\nyou're not careful, you installed Excel,\n\n84\n00:05:18.888 --> 00:05:21.934\nand right now we can see that\nExcel is associated with that CSV.\n\n85\n00:05:21.934 --> 00:05:25.730\nI installed another program\nthat supersedes that, right?\n\n86\n00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.110\nThat has overwritten that association\nbecause you installed it and\n\n87\n00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.726\nmaybe you were unaware and\nthese icons can change.\n\n88\n00:05:31.726 --> 00:05:38.670\nSo do be careful, there CSV in particular,\nyou can open those with Excel.\n\n89\n00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.320\nBut it might not necessarily\nshow the Excel icon,\n\n90\n00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.260\ndepending on what other\nprograms are on your computer.\n\n91\n00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's not an Excel file.\n\n92\n00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.310\nIt isn't, even though it looks like it is.\n\n93\n00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:50.950\nOkay, it's text.\n\n94\n00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.910\nSo how can we view this\nwith a text editor,\n\n95\n00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.710\nwhat we're gonna do instead\nof double clicking on it,\n\n96\n00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.700\nwe're gonna right click, and we're gonna\nopen this with, we'll go with Textedit.\n\n97\n00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.440\nOkay, just go straight\nup Text editing program.\n\n98\n00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.830\nI will zoom out a little bit,\njust so you can see it.\n\n99\n00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.150\nI know it's gonna start\ngetting a little blurry.\n\n100\n00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:13.300\nBut when I look at this, let's zoom\nback in, you can see that it has\n\n101\n00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:18.100\nevery comma for\nwhere there were columns, okay?\n\n102\n00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.300\nAnd just for a reference point,\nlet's do this.\n\n103\n00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.958\nLet's zoom out and\nlet's open up the Excel file of this,\n\n104\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:29.227\ncuz this is we took it from\nhere in our Excel format and\n\n105\n00:06:29.227 --> 00:06:31.866\nthen exported it out into a CSV.\n\n106\n00:06:31.866 --> 00:06:39.730\nLet me clarify one thing though, we don't\nhave an export command in Excel for Mac.\n\n107\n00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:41.010\nIt's really just a save as.\n\n108\n00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:43.890\nWhen you save as that's where you can\ngo ahead and change the file type.\n\n109\n00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:48.630\nSo no export, but\nin a sense you are exporting it, okay?\n\n110\n00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:52.330\nLet's switch back over here to\nour text editor, or Textedit and\n\n111\n00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.210\nyou can see that it's kind of throwing\nme some squigglies cuz it's seeing these\n\n112\n00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.650\nall as like these like, hey,\nthis are some commas and everything, but\n\n113\n00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:03.750\nthat's where we have every change in\ncolumn have a comma and at the end.\n\n114\n00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.310\nSo, just straight text, okay?\n\n115\n00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.340\nCommas separate the value, or\n\n116\n00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.850\nyou could also say that this\nis a comma delimited file.\n\n117\n00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:15.210\nA delimiter is another word for\na separator character.\n\n118\n00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:20.570\nAnd the limiters, CSV comma, but\nyou could have a tab delimited file.\n\n119\n00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:26.330\nSo it's separated by tabs, you could\nhave a semicolon as your delimiter.\n\n120\n00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.180\nI mean, you can choose\ndifferent characters as that's\n\n121\n00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.380\nthe one that's going to\nindicate a separation.\n\n122\n00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.430\nCommas and tabs are probably\ngonna be your most common ones,\n\n123\n00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:39.310\nin most computer places, places?\n\n124\n00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.256\nThings.\n&gt;&gt; Computer applications.\n\n125\n00:07:41.256 --> 00:07:41.830\n&gt;&gt; Places, things.\n\n126\n00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:44.350\n&gt;&gt; The stuff with the things,\nand the things and the stuff.\n\n127\n00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:48.399\nBut I can say that there are times where\nI've had to choose for my own work,\n\n128\n00:07:48.399 --> 00:07:50.828\nI've had to choose a different delimiter.\n\n129\n00:07:50.828 --> 00:07:55.230\nBecause within them there were commas\nlike contained within the values so\n\n130\n00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:59.206\nlike Instead doing tabs,\nwhich is actually a lot more readable for\n\n131\n00:07:59.206 --> 00:08:03.466\nan individual like you just open\nup the plain text, you're like,\n\n132\n00:08:03.466 --> 00:08:05.827\nkind of looks like a [CROSSTALK] table-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n133\n00:08:05.827 --> 00:08:06.385\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n134\n00:08:06.385 --> 00:08:08.757\n[SOUND] There it is.\n\n135\n00:08:08.757 --> 00:08:13.449\nThe other thing is obvious like\nvertical pipes, or something like that\n\n136\n00:08:13.449 --> 00:08:18.296\nwhere I've needed to preserve commas\ninterior so it's not, it doesn't\n\n137\n00:08:18.296 --> 00:08:23.190\nsplit on those commas and the other\ncommas because then it gets all weird.\n\n138\n00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:25.120\n&gt;&gt; I never even thought of that.\n\n139\n00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.590\nThat's really, yeah, exactly.\n\n140\n00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:30.340\nThe total reason why you'd want to use\ndifferent characters as the limiters,\n\n141\n00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:34.760\ndepending on what the actually\ninformation is on your columns, okay?\n\n142\n00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.910\nCool, all right so\nthis is just a plain text file, and\n\n143\n00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:41.320\nthat's what we're seeing,\nbut Excel will open that.\n\n144\n00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:45.428\nSo let me go ahead and I'll just close\nthis file, I did a command W, by the way.\n\n145\n00:08:45.428 --> 00:08:50.289\nAnd then let's open up that CSV file and\nnotice it's going to open up in Excel,\n\n146\n00:08:50.289 --> 00:08:52.450\nit looks like an Excel file.\n\n147\n00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:55.130\nCuz it sees you columns and\nit sees your rows, cool.\n\n148\n00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:58.280\nNow it does give you this little warning\nacross the top that hey it might have been\n\n149\n00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.630\nlost and everything,\nbecause it's not Excel.\n\n150\n00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:11.380\nExcel can support things like font size,\nfont color it can merge cells.\n\n151\n00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.240\nIt can do all those fancy stuff.\n\n152\n00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.680\nWell, the CSV file is not that fancy.\n\n153\n00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:21.492\nSo it's going to take everything out and\ngive you just the text version.\n\n154\n00:09:21.492 --> 00:09:23.470\n&gt;&gt; And that is something you\nneed to be careful about,\n\n155\n00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:25.410\nlet's go back over here to our files.\n\n156\n00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:28.150\nLike for example, if I open up\nthe Christmas Cats for example.\n\n157\n00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:32.550\nWe've seen this file a couple of times,\nlike this, work sheet and don't worry if\n\n158\n00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:36.910\nyou can't read it very clearly, but this\nright here, this is not a good example or\n\n159\n00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.780\na file that you would wanna\nsave out as a CSV file format.\n\n160\n00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.470\nBecause the data isn't contiguous.\n\n161\n00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:43.530\nIt's got spaces.\n\n162\n00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:46.150\nIt's got like a merged cell.\n\n163\n00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:48.370\nThis is not a good example.\n\n164\n00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:49.470\nThis one.\n\n165\n00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:50.040\nThis worksheet.\n\n166\n00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.730\nThis would be a good example\nto save it as a CSV file.\n\n167\n00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:58.740\nAnd remember, you're really using this\nfile format to transport information\n\n168\n00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:03.110\nacross systems platforms programs,\nall those different things.\n\n169\n00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:07.610\nAnd maybe that you can open a CSV file\nbecause is coming out from a proprietary\n\n170\n00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:11.990\ndata base within your company, that\ndoesn't spit out it in Excel data, but\n\n171\n00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:16.530\nif I get a CSV I can open it up in excel,\nand then from a CSV,\n\n172\n00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:21.380\nI would save it to an Excel file format,\ndo all my fancy stuff by\n\n173\n00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:25.200\nformatting it as a table and everything,\nand then it becomes an Excel file.\n\n174\n00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:30.240\nOr the same way, hey, I got it as an Excel\nfile, I've gotta save it down, or\n\n175\n00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:35.730\nexport, out to a CSV, hand it to Justin,\nbecause Justin needs to import that\n\n176\n00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:40.230\nInformation into that mainframe\ndatabase or that proprietary database.\n\n177\n00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:45.780\nSo you can see where it gets, kinda goes\nback and forth, of moving the data around.\n\n178\n00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:49.070\nNot the face merge cells, and\nthe formatting and everything.\n\n179\n00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:53.480\n&gt;&gt; And a lot of times you'll hear me say,\nthat's a data interchange format.\n\n180\n00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.520\nSo I want to exchange data.\n\n181\n00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:57.608\nI'm building a database, right?\n\n182\n00:10:57.608 --> 00:11:00.905\nSome kind of relational database, and\nVonne has some of the C data in an Excel\n\n183\n00:11:00.905 --> 00:11:03.860\nspreadsheet because that's\nwhat we've come up with.\n\n184\n00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:08.050\nI can't take Excel, put it in there,\nbut the interchange, the intermediate,\n\n185\n00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:13.480\nwhat we can both output and input as\na CSV, and that's a very common use case.\n\n186\n00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.390\nAlong with some other times, but\nI don't know if those are Excel related.\n\n187\n00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:19.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, these are great real world\nexamples we're doing right now.\n\n188\n00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.680\nI'm like hey, this is making\nsome real good sense right now.\n\n189\n00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:26.240\nSo hopefully it's making some good sense\nto you, as why you want to use it, because\n\n190\n00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:30.580\nit takes me probably 30 seconds to show\nyou how it's actually saved as a CSV file.\n\n191\n00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.750\nIt's pretty straight forward.\n\n192\n00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:36.440\nBut just understanding when and\nwhy and how.\n\n193\n00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.130\nKeeping on that, this one.\n\n194\n00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:42.660\nYou don't save this\nworksheet as a CSV file.\n\n195\n00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.860\nIt's not column and row data.\n\n196\n00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:50.310\nAnd that being said, I said this\nworksheet, because one of the limitations\n\n197\n00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:56.060\nof a CSV file format from\nExcel is worksheet specific,\n\n198\n00:11:56.060 --> 00:12:01.430\nmeaning I can only have one\nworksheet in a CSV file.\n\n199\n00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:08.730\nIf I had three worksheets that all had\njust regular, continuous data like this.\n\n200\n00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:14.140\nYou gotta save each sheet as\na separate CSV file, okay?\n\n201\n00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:18.440\nIt does not support workbooks,\ncuz I think, remember it's not Excel.\n\n202\n00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.820\nIt's just a text file, okay?\n\n203\n00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:24.670\nSo this would be the one that I would\nwant to be able to save out as a CSV.\n\n204\n00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:25.900\nSo, how do I do that?\n\n205\n00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:28.909\nWell, I will say this, right?\n\n206\n00:12:28.909 --> 00:12:30.200\nI have already alluded\nto it a couple times.\n\n207\n00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:33.150\nNotice, no export in here.\n\n208\n00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:35.920\nExport is a PC, I do not know if\nI mentioned this just yet or not,\n\n209\n00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:41.340\nbut the export is something that\nyou do see in the PC world.\n\n210\n00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.850\nWith Excel,\nyou might see that particular command.\n\n211\n00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:48.660\nBut it really is just saving it, and\nnot just changing its name and its home,\n\n212\n00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:54.120\nit's actual file type, so\nI'll move this over here.\n\n213\n00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.750\nSo this is kind of a little further down,\n\n214\n00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:59.020\nyou might need to see it a little bit\nbetter, but I'll zoom in in just a second.\n\n215\n00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:02.440\nBut notice I have a couple different\nfile formats to chose from.\n\n216\n00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:07.260\nIf I scroll on down, this is where\nit might get a little confusing.\n\n217\n00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:12.200\nNotice I have CSV up here, but\nthen I also have it down here, and\n\n218\n00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.130\nI have it here, and I have it here,\nand you're like, wait a second.\n\n219\n00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.910\nI thought you said it's just a CSV file.\n\n220\n00:13:19.815 --> 00:13:21.265\nNow we get into the world.\n\n221\n00:13:21.265 --> 00:13:22.985\nJustin's over here smiling.\n\n222\n00:13:22.985 --> 00:13:27.595\nYou get in the world of encoding and\ncharacter sets,\n\n223\n00:13:27.595 --> 00:13:30.985\nand then we get into ANSII and\nAski and UTFA and\n\n224\n00:13:30.985 --> 00:13:33.495\nall this fun stuff that I actually\nreally like to geek out on.\n\n225\n00:13:33.495 --> 00:13:39.245\nI'm gonna keep it, I'm gonna try not\nto go off the rails here for you.\n\n226\n00:13:39.245 --> 00:13:43.734\nI do have some references for\nyou guys to look at, but\n\n227\n00:13:43.734 --> 00:13:50.071\nit's really just the, I always wanna\nsay it's like the dialect, okay?\n\n228\n00:13:50.071 --> 00:13:52.350\nLike if I said how do you spell color?\n\n229\n00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:56.855\n&gt;&gt; Well I would say C-O-L-O-R, I think.\n\n230\n00:13:56.855 --> 00:13:58.260\nC-O-L-O-R.\n\n231\n00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.910\nHowever, there is sometimes a U in their,\nand that has to do with regional\n\n232\n00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:07.230\ndifferences, or\njust language kind of nuances,\n\n233\n00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:12.370\nthat can occur, and well these encoding\ntypes, kind of are encapsulated by that.\n\n234\n00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:15.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's the same thing,\nwhen we say aluminum foil, right?\n\n235\n00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:20.020\nI had a friend in a high school\nwho her mom was from England, and\n\n236\n00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:22.750\nshe would say aluminium, aluminium foil.\n\n237\n00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:26.090\nAnd I always loved that, and\nI'm just like it's aluminum.\n\n238\n00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:30.110\nYeah, but\nit's the same idea here with the CSV file.\n\n239\n00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:33.768\nWhat dialect or\nencoding do you want this to be at?\n\n240\n00:14:33.768 --> 00:14:38.860\nI'll say [LAUGH] maybe you should\njust go with this first one,\n\n241\n00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:41.638\nwhich is the CSV UTF-8.\n\n242\n00:14:41.638 --> 00:14:46.770\nThis is universal type I can't remember,\nI'll show you it in a minute.\n\n243\n00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:49.380\nBut this is just one you probably\nshould just go ahead and use.\n\n244\n00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:50.430\nIt's the common format.\n\n245\n00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:55.450\nBut notice you have the MS-DOS one,\na Macintosh version,\n\n246\n00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:59.980\na Comma Separated Value just by itself,\nbut you see it's specialty.\n\n247\n00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:03.190\nI'd probably stay away from it and\njust use this one, okay,\n\n248\n00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:07.870\nfor just kind of like nod and move on.\n\n249\n00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:10.980\nAnd hopefully most of\nthe times it'll work.\n\n250\n00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:14.300\nI'll put this on my desktop for now and\nnotice I have Christmas Cat's example.\n\n251\n00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:15.900\nWe'll go ahead and click save.\n\n252\n00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:20.270\nAnd then notice it does say right here\nyou cannot save multiple worksheets, so\n\n253\n00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:22.920\nmake sure that you're\ndoing the active sheet.\n\n254\n00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:23.640\nYeah, I'm good.\n\n255\n00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:29.270\nYou click OK, and then I am now,\nbecause I did a save as.\n\n256\n00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:30.920\nI'm now in the CSV file format.\n\n257\n00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.880\nDon't let this confuse you.\n\n258\n00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.670\nBecause this is the CSV file,\n\n259\n00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:38.160\nbecause anytime you do a file save as\nyou're working in that particular file.\n\n260\n00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.960\nBut it has multiple worksheets.\n\n261\n00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.190\nI know, it's really confusing.\n\n262\n00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:44.140\nJust stop, close it.\n\n263\n00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.530\nBut then it says, well wait a second,\ndon't you want to save the changes?\n\n264\n00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:48.365\nAnd you're like, wait I already did it.\n\n265\n00:15:48.365 --> 00:15:52.114\nIt's this weird loop when you do a file\nsave as, you're in the CSV file,\n\n266\n00:15:52.114 --> 00:15:55.572\nthen you try to close it and\nthen it's trying to tell you to save it.\n\n267\n00:15:55.572 --> 00:15:57.216\nIt's like, no I already saved it.\n\n268\n00:15:57.216 --> 00:16:01.920\nJust don't worry about this, and\njust say don't save, okay, just trust me.\n\n269\n00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:07.510\nIt will make your life a lot easier,\nbecause now if I look on my desktop,\n\n270\n00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:10.680\nright here, this is the CSV file.\n\n271\n00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:13.990\nThis is the one I want, so\nlet's try it, let's open it.\n\n272\n00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:16.110\nWhen I open this, there it is.\n\n273\n00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:19.630\nNotice this one, look it down here,\nthere's not multiple worksheets in here.\n\n274\n00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:22.210\nIt's a single worksheet,\nand that's what it is.\n\n275\n00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:25.840\nIt's a strange loop, and I tell people,\nit gets them thrown off, cuz they're like,\n\n276\n00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.880\nwait, do I need to Save As, and\nthen they Save As again, and\n\n277\n00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.830\nSave As again, and ugh, no.\n\n278\n00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:33.180\nStop and just close it, and there you go.\n\n279\n00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:36.990\nI saved an Excel file, as a CSV file,\n\n280\n00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:40.518\nsent it on to Justin to put it into\nhis database, and I'm good to go.\n\n281\n00:16:40.518 --> 00:16:44.011\n[LAUGH]\nYeah,\n\n282\n00:16:44.011 --> 00:16:48.150\nwell it doesn't always work that time\nbecause of, and I just pull these up\n\n283\n00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:52.640\nreally quickly because there's this a\nwhole idea of your character encoding, and\n\n284\n00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:55.440\nit's just again, those kind of\npatterns and what we're looking at.\n\n285\n00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.380\nUTF-8 is, okay,\n\n286\n00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:03.770\nit is Universal Character\nSet Transformation Format.\n\n287\n00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:11.116\nOkay, well wait, or Universal Coded\nCharacter Set Transformation Format.\n\n288\n00:17:11.116 --> 00:17:14.448\nIt's just a bunch of letters, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's unicode transformation format.\n\n289\n00:17:14.448 --> 00:17:16.581\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; And then there we go, or\n\n290\n00:17:16.581 --> 00:17:19.276\nuniversal coded character set.\n\n291\n00:17:19.276 --> 00:17:23.000\n&gt;&gt; So the first word they use\neither one of those two phrases,\n\n292\n00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.190\nbut the way that is worded,\ncan be a little, it's kind of weird.\n\n293\n00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:31.415\n&gt;&gt; And I think of where they broke the\nline, too, and I wasn't paying attention\n\n294\n00:17:31.415 --> 00:17:34.730\nto the parenthesis, as like,\nunicode, which is this, and\n\n295\n00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:38.710\nthen the rest of it transformation form,\nthank you, I was testing you.\n\n296\n00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:39.453\nOkay [LAUGH].\n\n297\n00:17:39.453 --> 00:17:43.749\n&gt;&gt; Well hopefully I passed, and\nwe can all have a good time.\n\n298\n00:17:43.749 --> 00:17:46.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You get another cookie.\n\n299\n00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:51.161\nAll right, so we, yeah, and this ASCII\nagain, I love reading about this stuff.\n\n300\n00:17:51.161 --> 00:17:55.632\nIt's again, all about how we designate the\ncharacter sets and how it translates that\n\n301\n00:17:55.632 --> 00:17:59.109\nparticular language, okay,\njust had to throw that in there, and\n\n302\n00:17:59.109 --> 00:18:01.738\nI had to remind myself of\nwhat UTF actually meant.\n\n303\n00:18:01.738 --> 00:18:06.916\nOkay, now the thing is this can get weird.\n\n304\n00:18:06.916 --> 00:18:11.255\nLet me open that folder back up,\ncuz that's a CSV file, right?\n\n305\n00:18:11.255 --> 00:18:15.110\nThis one's a CSV file,\nit should open up just fine.\n\n306\n00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:20.430\nI open it up, and that's weird,\nand if I look at this and\n\n307\n00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:26.070\nI look at cell A1 all the information\n\n308\n00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:29.415\nis located in this first column.\n\n309\n00:18:29.415 --> 00:18:31.157\nWait, what?\n\n310\n00:18:31.157 --> 00:18:36.990\nHey I [LAUGH] it's just\nlike I don't understand.\n\n311\n00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:40.480\nHold that thought Justin,\ncuz Justin's over here doing this.\n\n312\n00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:43.130\nAll right, let's look at this.\n\n313\n00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:45.430\nI open this up in my Text Editor.\n\n314\n00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:49.730\nWhere are my commas?\n\n315\n00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:51.977\nThose aren't commas, those are what?\n\n316\n00:18:51.977 --> 00:18:53.541\n&gt;&gt; Those look to be tag characters.\n\n317\n00:18:53.541 --> 00:18:54.055\n&gt;&gt; They do.\n\n318\n00:18:54.055 --> 00:18:57.492\n&gt;&gt; And so we have a different\ndelimeter and we get weird behavior.\n\n319\n00:18:57.492 --> 00:18:59.375\n&gt;&gt; But\nI will tell you this is the weird thing.\n\n320\n00:18:59.375 --> 00:19:03.743\nOkay, I did this on my\nMac with a Mac Exel file,\n\n321\n00:19:03.743 --> 00:19:09.231\nsaved as a CSV, and\nthis is what it give me, and I'm like,\n\n322\n00:19:09.231 --> 00:19:13.736\nwell let me throw one more\nlittle hook in there.\n\n323\n00:19:13.736 --> 00:19:16.662\nIt actually originated as a PC.\n\n324\n00:19:16.662 --> 00:19:20.431\nI created this file on my virtual\nmachine in my PC, as an Excel PC,\n\n325\n00:19:20.431 --> 00:19:24.886\nthen I went ahead and put them in on\nDropbox, and then put them down into here,\n\n326\n00:19:24.886 --> 00:19:26.619\nand now I've got it on my Mac.\n\n327\n00:19:26.619 --> 00:19:29.230\nI opened up the Excel file, then I saved\nit as a CSV, and this is what happened.\n\n328\n00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:33.119\nI started really talking really fast,\nbut I'm like, what?\n\n329\n00:19:33.119 --> 00:19:34.535\nThis is Mac to Mac?\n\n330\n00:19:34.535 --> 00:19:35.680\nI don't understand.\n\n331\n00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:41.326\nI still did this, and it is really weird,\nand I don't know how and\n\n332\n00:19:41.326 --> 00:19:46.271\nwhy it happened, but it did,\nand this can happen to you.\n\n333\n00:19:46.271 --> 00:19:48.333\nNow I will say what I did to fix it is I,\n\n334\n00:19:48.333 --> 00:19:52.090\na lot of times what I'll do is\nI'll take this and I'll select it.\n\n335\n00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:58.080\nI'll either put it into Word, and\nthen make it a table, or select it,\n\n336\n00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:03.190\nand then copy it directly back\ninto a new worksheet in Excel,\n\n337\n00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:08.320\nand hopefully it will go ahead, and see,\nlook at that, cuz it found the delimiter,\n\n338\n00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:12.856\nand with it just a straight copy and\npaste, then it found the columns.\n\n339\n00:20:12.856 --> 00:20:16.086\nI don't know.\n\n340\n00:20:16.086 --> 00:20:18.094\nAny thoughts on that one Justin?\n\n341\n00:20:18.094 --> 00:20:19.939\n&gt;&gt;

Open?\n\n347\n00:20:39.804 --> 00:20:40.778\n&gt;&gt; From within Excel?\n\n348\n00:20:40.778 --> 00:20:43.990\n&gt;&gt; From within Excel and\nsee if we can say,\n\n349\n00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:47.410\nhey, I know that this character\nis going to be weird.\n\n350\n00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:48.651\n&gt;&gt;

There we go.\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n358\n00:21:07.284 --> 00:21:12.044\nOkay, so now it is saying,\nhey, I need help!\n\n359\n00:21:12.044 --> 00:21:13.930\nGood job, all right!\n\n360\n00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:17.126\nSee, I was testing you again.\n\n361\n00:21:17.126 --> 00:21:20.389\nThe text wizard has determined, duh, duh,\nduh, okay, now we've go on ahead and\n\n362\n00:21:20.389 --> 00:21:21.610\nsay yes, I want it delimited.\n\n363\n00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:23.468\nIt is UTF-8.\n\n364\n00:21:23.468 --> 00:21:24.408\nWe'll go with Next.\n\n365\n00:21:24.408 --> 00:21:25.250\nWhat is it?\n\n366\n00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:26.160\nIt's the Tab.\n\n367\n00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.078\nSee now it's finding the columns.\n\n368\n00:21:29.078 --> 00:21:31.160\nOkay, all right, this is good.\n\n369\n00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:34.190\nWe don't wanna just double-click it,\nwe wanna open it up in Excel and\n\n370\n00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:36.100\nhave it do the fun translation.\n\n371\n00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.988\nOkay, cool, we click Next, and then this,\n\n372\n00:21:38.988 --> 00:21:43.320\nthis is just when it gets into\ndata formats, or self-formatting,\n\n373\n00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:48.954\nanother episode for that, we click finish,\nand it should go ahead, and look at there.\n\n374\n00:21:48.954 --> 00:21:49.952\nYou're a genius.\n\n375\n00:21:49.952 --> 00:21:51.327\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't know about a genius.\n\n376\n00:21:51.327 --> 00:21:56.129\nYou might be overselling that one,\nbut I've had a fair amount of dealings\n\n377\n00:21:56.129 --> 00:21:59.782\nwith Excel, and\npoorly formatted CSVs in particular.\n\n378\n00:21:59.782 --> 00:22:01.975\nThat might be the limit in my experience,\nbut\n\n379\n00:22:01.975 --> 00:22:04.310\nI've had to fix these several times, so.\n\n380\n00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:08.009\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and the way I've been doing\nit is opening it up in the Text Editor,\n\n381\n00:22:08.009 --> 00:22:10.313\nselecting it, and\nthen pasting it in Excel,\n\n382\n00:22:10.313 --> 00:22:14.134\nwhich it's almost like we kinda got to\nthe same result two different ways,\n\n383\n00:22:14.134 --> 00:22:18.503\nbecause that's just the way, like what you\nwere saying, this is my dealing with it,\n\n384\n00:22:18.503 --> 00:22:21.381\nthis is how I fixed it, and\nthat was how Justin fixed it.\n\n385\n00:22:21.381 --> 00:22:24.876\nIt's still the whole idea of not\nunderstanding the delimited character.\n\n386\n00:22:24.876 --> 00:22:27.190\nVery cool, that was fun, thanks.\n\n387\n00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:29.794\nSo we're going to close out of Excel.\n\n388\n00:22:29.794 --> 00:22:33.704\nNow CSV is probably gonna be one of the\nmost common formats that you're going to\n\n389\n00:22:33.704 --> 00:22:37.731\nexport out into, or maybe I'm making\nan assumption on that one, but yeah, no,\n\n390\n00:22:37.731 --> 00:22:41.250\nit's gonna be pretty much CSVs,\nbut there are some other ones.\n\n391\n00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:44.943\nLet's look at this department and\naddresses.\n\n392\n00:22:44.943 --> 00:22:45.700\nThere we go.\n\n393\n00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:50.130\nI will have this particular worksheet,\nmaybe just zoom in, so you can see it.\n\n394\n00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:57.076\nSome other file formats that you\nwould want to Save As, or Export.\n\n395\n00:22:57.076 --> 00:23:00.989\nThere's honestly not very many I\ncan really suggest to you, okay.\n\n396\n00:23:00.989 --> 00:23:04.699\nThere's a couple of them down in here,\nmaybe like this one, or\n\n397\n00:23:04.699 --> 00:23:09.611\nat least just kind of talking about the\nparticular file format, which is the XLSM.\n\n398\n00:23:09.611 --> 00:23:12.500\nThis means that this is\na macro enabled file.\n\n399\n00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:15.733\nWell if I saved it right now,\nsince I don't have any macros, so\n\n400\n00:23:15.733 --> 00:23:19.210\nit's kind of pointless, okay, but\nif you start writing macros and\n\n401\n00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:22.455\ncode you'd wanna save it in a file\nformat that accepts macros.\n\n402\n00:23:22.455 --> 00:23:24.910\nWhen you talk about macros,\nyou always talk about security.\n\n403\n00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:27.850\nWe have that in our advanced series, so\n\n404\n00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:31.365\nwe're just gonna kind\nof stop it right there.\n\n405\n00:23:31.365 --> 00:23:33.998\nYep, and just go smile and\nwave, and just move on.\n\n406\n00:23:33.998 --> 00:23:40.564\nBut you need to save a macro\nExcel file in a macro file type,\n\n407\n00:23:40.564 --> 00:23:44.589\nlittle bit of circulation mm-hm.\n\n408\n00:23:44.589 --> 00:23:47.775\nSo in some other ones down here,\n\n409\n00:23:47.775 --> 00:23:52.732\nyou could save it as a tab delimited file,\n[SOUND].\n\n410\n00:23:52.732 --> 00:23:54.147\nWhat do you think Justin?\n\n411\n00:23:54.147 --> 00:23:58.489\n&gt;&gt; So it's funny, because this is\nsomething I've struggled with In Excel\n\n412\n00:23:58.489 --> 00:24:00.846\nthey wanna put a .txt file extension.\n\n413\n00:24:00.846 --> 00:24:05.257\nThere are some other programs that\nif you have a .tsv file extension,\n\n414\n00:24:05.257 --> 00:24:08.696\nthey will recognize it as\na tab separated values file,\n\n415\n00:24:08.696 --> 00:24:13.260\nand it will automatically parse it and\nopen it up correctly.\n\n416\n00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:18.240\nSo, it's kind of odd the file extension\nis meant to convey a convention, or\n\n417\n00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.980\nan intention, that you're gonna use.\n\n418\n00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:23.630\nBut by default,\nwill put tabs in there and put a .txt.\n\n419\n00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:29.516\nAnd then, other things are like,\nmaybe it's a tab maybe it's space.\n\n420\n00:24:29.516 --> 00:24:30.508\nWho knows?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n421\n00:24:30.508 --> 00:24:33.460\n&gt;&gt; The .txt is just,\nthere's some text in there.\n\n422\n00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:35.770\nAnd that's all we're gonna tell you.\n\n423\n00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:37.787\nSo, it's kind of odd that they do that.\n\n424\n00:24:37.787 --> 00:24:38.630\n&gt;&gt; I think so too.\n\n425\n00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:41.390\nAgain, if you need a separator,\njust go with a CSV.\n\n426\n00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:42.650\nI think that's the way to go.\n\n427\n00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:44.660\nBut it is an option.\n\n428\n00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:49.420\nThere is another file format down\nhere at the bottom, sorry, it's ODS,\n\n429\n00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.810\nwhich is OpenDocument Spreadsheet.\n\n430\n00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:56.000\nI will tell you right now, since I'm\nalways going to be working in office\n\n431\n00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.190\nproducts, I don't have any reason to\nexport it out as a Open document format.\n\n432\n00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:02.654\nBut for all of you that are not,\n\n433\n00:25:02.654 --> 00:25:07.690\n[LAUGH] Justin's smiling,\nmore into the proprietary file formats.\n\n434\n00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:09.650\nYou can save it out as that.\n\n435\n00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:13.610\nI can't attest to how much you're gonna\nlose in the sense of formatting and\n\n436\n00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:14.690\nwhat have you.\n\n437\n00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:17.540\nBut I at least wanted to\nkind of point that one out.\n\n438\n00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:19.010\n&gt;&gt; I can give you a quick blob on that.\n\n439\n00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:22.520\nI actually use Linux,\nI use Open Office, I use Office, and\n\n440\n00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.439\nthings like that which support ODS.\n\n441\n00:25:24.439 --> 00:25:26.331\nAnd at the time of this recording,\n\n442\n00:25:26.331 --> 00:25:29.473\nit's gotten significantly\nbetter at keeping formats.\n\n443\n00:25:29.473 --> 00:25:32.803\nThere are still times where it will go,\n[SOUND], then scatter, or\n\n444\n00:25:32.803 --> 00:25:35.232\nyou'll lose coloration and\nthings like that.\n\n445\n00:25:35.232 --> 00:25:39.122\nBut by and large it is a nice way for\nyou, and I to share documents, and\n\n446\n00:25:39.122 --> 00:25:41.940\nmaybe we can compromise on\nthings that we can, and\n\n447\n00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:44.760\ncannot use necessary to work back and\nforth.\n\n448\n00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:45.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n449\n00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:48.890\nany time you go into like Google Docs,\nor Google Spreadsheets and you try.\n\n450\n00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:51.710\nIt can like open Excel,\n\n451\n00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:56.620\nor export out as Excel, but\nit's still again two different platforms.\n\n452\n00:25:56.620 --> 00:26:01.320\nSo, any time you go between any of those,\nOffice to OpenOffice,\n\n453\n00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:05.550\nor Office to Google Docs,\nor Google Docs to Excel.\n\n454\n00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:07.880\nIt can get a little hairy in there.\n\n455\n00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:11.160\nMight as well just mention it, but I would\n[LAUGH] just say stay away from them,\n\n456\n00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:16.620\nis your MHT files, your webpage files,\nand all that stuff.\n\n457\n00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:22.260\nYou know what, in this day and age,\nwith their cloud-based file systems,\n\n458\n00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:25.850\nand how you can share them out,\nthere is really no reason for this.\n\n459\n00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:28.380\nMaybe I am being a little\nbiased right here.\n\n460\n00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:32.190\nI do not think you need it,\nso just stay away from that.\n\n461\n00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:34.960\nThen the other one you do have is a PDF,\n\n462\n00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:38.190\nI'll tell you if I'm gonna save something\nas a PDF, which I do quite frequently,\n\n463\n00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:41.860\nbecause I just want you have\nit as a picture almost.\n\n464\n00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:43.590\nI don't do a file save as.\n\n465\n00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:50.190\nIf I'm gonna make this a PDF, and\nI'm on a MAC, you're gonna go to print.\n\n466\n00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:54.950\nOkay, you're going to do, file, print,\nand we have more episodes on printing,\n\n467\n00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:56.450\nand print settings and\neverything like that.\n\n468\n00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:59.400\nBecause down there,\nthat's where you save as a PDF.\n\n469\n00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.500\nAnd this is a very Mac centric thing.\n\n470\n00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:02.760\nIt's always down there.\n\n471\n00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:07.480\nYou can always save it as a PDF, and\nthen whatever your settings are for\n\n472\n00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:10.600\nthe printing, what one sheets,\nhow you are going to scale it, and\n\n473\n00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.640\nall that kind of stuff stays with it.\n\n474\n00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:15.600\nSo, I don't go through\nthe Save-As to do PDF.\n\n475\n00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:16.715\nI always go to the print.\n\n476\n00:27:16.715 --> 00:27:22.354\nAnd then, I can go ahead and save the\nwhole just for fun is I save it as a PDF.\n\n477\n00:27:22.354 --> 00:27:27.272\nThen I get into the option for where do I\nwant to go, and how I can kind of do these\n\n478\n00:27:27.272 --> 00:27:31.460\ndifferent things, but\nthat's probably usually how I would go.\n\n479\n00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:34.240\nTo each his own.\nUse the save as,\n\n480\n00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.910\nit will still do it for you.\n\n481\n00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:38.300\nAnd those are your major file formats.\n\n482\n00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:40.950\nI'm just gonna touch on this\nlast one really quickly.\n\n483\n00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:43.890\nYou can also save it as an Excel template.\n\n484\n00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:50.630\nI have a whole episode on using templates\nin Excel in the advanced series,\n\n485\n00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:55.620\nbut just really quickly\nthe file format is an XLTX.\n\n486\n00:27:55.620 --> 00:28:00.350\nSo, template, and then you would\njust do a File &gt; Save As, and\n\n487\n00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:02.390\nthen you change it to a template.\n\n488\n00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:07.000\nAnd do notice that right here, do you\nsee like the path of like, goodness,\n\n489\n00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.400\nwhere am I, right?\n\n490\n00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.920\nDo not change the directory.\n\n491\n00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:14.030\nBecause if you change the directory\nit won't understand it.\n\n492\n00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:18.750\nSo, you need to do that in a template\nis one of those like when we did a file\n\n493\n00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:22.130\nnew form template where we\nhave these starting points.\n\n494\n00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:27.450\nYou will then have you're own templates\nto be able to have like a starting point,\n\n495\n00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:33.195\nlike a stamp, and\nthen you create a new file excel file.\n\n496\n00:28:33.195 --> 00:28:34.262\nSo, XLS.\n\n497\n00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:41.556\nTemplates, you make it and\nyou save it as an Excel SLSX file.\n\n498\n00:28:41.556 --> 00:28:45.097\nMore on that in that particular episode\nof that single little circular unit, and\n\n499\n00:28:45.097 --> 00:28:46.565\nyou're just kind of like.\n\n500\n00:28:46.565 --> 00:28:49.375\nI'll tell you more about it,\nbut it is a file type, so\n\n501\n00:28:49.375 --> 00:28:53.140\nI at least wanted to go ahead and\nmention it in this episode.\n\n502\n00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:54.840\nAnd there we go.\n\n503\n00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:58.240\nDefinitely read up on all of\nthat kinda fun and coding stuff.\n\n504\n00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:01.180\nIt's very geeky and it's very technical.\n\n505\n00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:05.080\nSince I do a lot of stuff with text, and\nfonts, and font faces and open type fonts,\n\n506\n00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:11.060\nthis is kind of one of\nmy little geek session,\n\n507\n00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:13.700\nso we all have them and\nthat's fine [LAUGH].\n\n508\n00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:16.820\n&gt;&gt; Well, Von, you've definitely geeked\nout to me before, but all I know is\n\n509\n00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:21.080\nthe different coding types tends to cause\nme horrible pain from time to time.\n\n510\n00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:25.030\nBut if you're aware of them,\nyou can alleviate that a fair amount.\n\n511\n00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:28.120\nWell, thank you for\nreviewing all those file types, and\n\n512\n00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:32.040\nexports, and\nall of those weird nuance behaviors like.\n\n513\n00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:35.000\nI save as a CSV, kind of.\n\n514\n00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.070\nBut now, I need to close it, don't save,\nre-open, and now I'm good to go.\n\n515\n00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:40.710\nSo, do keep that in mind,\n\n516\n00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:44.180\nbecause you don't want to get\nlost in your own computer.\n\n517\n00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:47.173\nAnd speaking of getting lost, definitely\ndon't get lost, so you can come on back.\n\n518\n00:29:47.173 --> 00:29:48.860\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n519\n00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:51.970\nSo, signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host Justin Denison.\n\n520\n00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:52.840\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Von Smith.\n\n521\n00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.180\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n522\n00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:59.360\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.568 --> 00:00:17.638\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.638 --> 00:00:21.550\nwe're continuing on with our Excel\n2016 Essentials for Mac series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.211\nAnd we're gonna be modifying a workbook,\nactually modifying a worksheet, I'm sorry.\n\n6\n00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.920\nThose terms just kind of roll\noff the tongue sometimes.\n\n7\n00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.220\nBut luckily we have someone better\nversed in it than I, Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.816\nHow you doing today, Vonne?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing pretty good.\n\n9\n00:00:35.816 --> 00:00:40.895\nAnd hey, I get them confused all the time\ntoo, so [LAUGH] I totally feel you there.\n\n10\n00:00:40.895 --> 00:00:46.830\nBut yes, we are getting into a new topic\nright now called format workbooks.\n\n11\n00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.905\nOkay, the term format, it can mean modify,\n\n12\n00:00:50.905 --> 00:00:54.783\nit can mean change, make look different.\n\n13\n00:00:54.783 --> 00:00:59.566\nJazz it up a little bit, right,\ngussy it up as I like to always say.\n\n14\n00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:01.982\nI mean we have some other\nterminology I'm sure there Justin.\n\n15\n00:01:01.982 --> 00:01:04.382\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't know about those.\n\n16\n00:01:04.382 --> 00:01:05.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.650\n&gt;&gt; It's funny, when I hear format,\n\n18\n00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.458\nand I'm in a computer\nland I start to panic.\n\n19\n00:01:08.458 --> 00:01:12.316\nBecause I'm not saying I have, but I might\nhave formatted a couple of drives before,\n\n20\n00:01:12.316 --> 00:01:14.417\nwhich actually has\na different connotation.\n\n21\n00:01:14.417 --> 00:01:17.947\nSo if you're one of those, maybe a little\nmore technical-savvy than others,\n\n22\n00:01:17.947 --> 00:01:19.017\nand you're like format.\n\n23\n00:01:19.017 --> 00:01:20.447\nNo, this is not what I wanna do.\n\n24\n00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:23.657\nWell format in this term is,\nwe're gonna guess it up,\n\n25\n00:01:23.657 --> 00:01:26.517\nhang some trim on it,\nslap a coat of paint on it.\n\n26\n00:01:26.517 --> 00:01:31.760\nOr maybe just make it look a little bit\ndifferent, change it a little, who knows?\n\n27\n00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.434\nAnd well, who better knows than her?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, I mean,\n\n28\n00:01:35.434 --> 00:01:38.225\nif you format a hard drive,\nyou are changing it.\n\n29\n00:01:38.225 --> 00:01:39.920\nSo I guess it's all the same.\n\n30\n00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.440\nBut you know what?\n\n31\n00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.685\nTomato, tomato, what are we doing?\n\n32\n00:01:41.685 --> 00:01:45.910\nWe're gonna be messing around with columns\nand we're gonna be merging some things.\n\n33\n00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.700\nSo it's just making it look pretty.\n\n34\n00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.887\nWhy don't we jump down and\nshow you a few things?\n\n35\n00:01:49.887 --> 00:01:53.895\nNow I have a file called Modify\na Worksheet, that's cool.\n\n36\n00:01:53.895 --> 00:01:57.842\nCuz we do have a separate episode\nabout modifying a workbook.\n\n37\n00:01:57.842 --> 00:01:59.767\nAnd that's in a different connotation.\n\n38\n00:01:59.767 --> 00:02:02.860\nSo this is just the sheet versus the book.\n\n39\n00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.300\nI also have another file,\nI did a command tilday by the way,\n\n40\n00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.818\nof my keyboard shortcut, to flip between\nopen workbooks within the application.\n\n41\n00:02:10.818 --> 00:02:13.700\nThis is our Christmas cats example,\nya'll been seeing it.\n\n42\n00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.000\nBut throughout these next episodes,\nas we go through these,\n\n43\n00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.940\nwe're gonna end up making everything\nlook very similar to this.\n\n44\n00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.820\nAs you can see, this looks completely\ndifferent than say this, okay?\n\n45\n00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.820\nAnd I know I'm zoomed out, or\nI don't have the text very big.\n\n46\n00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:37.070\nBut this information from this worksheet\nto this worksheet and this workbook.\n\n47\n00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.160\nThey're the same thing.\n\n48\n00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.980\nThey just look completely different.\n\n49\n00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.900\nIt's got a lot of pretty paint on it,\nright?\n\n50\n00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.790\nSo that's what we're going to start doing.\n\n51\n00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.010\nBut before we get into colors,\nand fonts and\n\n52\n00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.940\nall that kind of fun stuff, we just need\nto, hey, let's talk about our rows, and\n\n53\n00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.140\ncolumns and our cells, first of all.\n\n54\n00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.548\nSo let's get into our columns and rows.\n\n55\n00:03:00.548 --> 00:03:05.420\nAnd I'm gonna zoom so\nyou can see this a little bit clearer.\n\n56\n00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.320\nWe got our columns across the top and\nour rows.\n\n57\n00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.510\nNow this is some of the things we\nhave talked about in other episodes.\n\n58\n00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.770\nSo if it seems like it's repetitive,\nit is.\n\n59\n00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.810\nWe have our black arrow pointing\ndown on our column references.\n\n60\n00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.730\nThis means that we will be\nselecting our entire column.\n\n61\n00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.251\nThe same thing as if I move over here.\n\n62\n00:03:25.251 --> 00:03:27.830\nI get a black arrow pointing to the right.\n\n63\n00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.750\nThat's where I can select my rows.\n\n64\n00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.689\nCuz if we're gonna be adding rows,\ninserting rows, deleting rows,\n\n65\n00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:38.046\nselecting rows or columns,\nyou need to know how to do that.\n\n66\n00:03:38.046 --> 00:03:44.460\nSo if I told you, hey, go ahead and\nselect all of column E.\n\n67\n00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.190\nThat means you'd come over to column E,\n\n68\n00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.450\nyou'd single click that\nblack arrow pointing down.\n\n69\n00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.880\nAnd you would select that whole column,\n\n70\n00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.220\nall the way down to\nthe bottom of the worksheet.\n\n71\n00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.020\nIf I told you to select columns B,\nC and D,\n\n72\n00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.910\nthen that would be,\ntake your black pointed arrow.\n\n73\n00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.790\nHold and drag across, just like if\nI was selecting a range of cells,\n\n74\n00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.570\nyou can select a range of\ncolumns within this worksheet.\n\n75\n00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.390\nSame thing with rows, and I should\nprobably also say, hey, if I tell you to\n\n76\n00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.390\ndeselect this, like click off of this,\njust means click off on some blank cell.\n\n77\n00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.530\nAnd then it turns off that selection.\n\n78\n00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.750\nSame thing with our rows, but\nyou need to make sure you're looking for\n\n79\n00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.730\nthe right mouse cursor icon of the black\narrows, not the ones in between it.\n\n80\n00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.250\nThat does something different,\nbecause the in between\n\n81\n00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.610\nchanges your column widths or\nyour row heights.\n\n82\n00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.610\nTalks about in another episode,\nhey, right here in column E,\n\n83\n00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.280\nyou can see that this actually\nsays 333 Rabbit Hole Lane.\n\n84\n00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.310\nSo that is what's in it, but\n\n85\n00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.450\nsince I have another entry right over\nhere in Tampa, it's cutting it off.\n\n86\n00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.600\nSo why I can't see it?\n\n87\n00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.531\nWell, just make the column wider, okay?\n\n88\n00:04:56.531 --> 00:05:00.268\nNothing says you have to keep the columns\nexactly like they are by default,\n\n89\n00:05:00.268 --> 00:05:01.710\nmake them bigger.\n\n90\n00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.260\nSo if I come up to the in\nbetween part between E and\n\n91\n00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.879\nF, I get a line with two\narrows pointing off the side.\n\n92\n00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.990\nThat indicates change the column width.\n\n93\n00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.250\nThe first way that you can do this\nis if you just click, hold and drag.\n\n94\n00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.552\nI'm gonna click, hold,\n\n95\n00:05:19.552 --> 00:05:23.270\nnotice it does show you a little\ntooltip of how wide it's getting.\n\n96\n00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.350\nIt doesn't show you a preview of moving,\nif you wanna say, making it wider.\n\n97\n00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.290\nIf you let go, notice that,\nall right, it made it wider.\n\n98\n00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.840\nSo I make it a little bit more,\nmake it a little bit more.\n\n99\n00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.280\nAnd, if I zoom out, did I get it to,\nyep, all right, perfect.\n\n100\n00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.488\nI have made this column wide enough\nto be able show all the content.\n\n101\n00:05:41.488 --> 00:05:43.302\nSo you could do that with all of them.\n\n102\n00:05:43.302 --> 00:05:45.790\nAnd I can come into here and\nclick, hold and drag.\n\n103\n00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.263\nI can come over here click, hold and\ndrag, so I can make this column wider.\n\n104\n00:05:49.263 --> 00:05:55.000\nBut there's also something cool that you\ncan do, and that is known as AutoFit.\n\n105\n00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.724\nDo you know this one, Justin?\n&gt;&gt; This is actually my default behavior.\n\n106\n00:05:58.724 --> 00:06:01.780\nI'm like click, click and yay!\n\n107\n00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.190\nBut sometimes,\nI do run into some odd issues.\n\n108\n00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.870\nAnd I suspect you're\ngonna highlight those.\n\n109\n00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.640\nSo I'm not going to steal\nyour thunder on that one.\n\n110\n00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.990\nBut yep, double-click,\nmakes it easy for me.\n\n111\n00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.890\n&gt;&gt; So much easier, yes, I love that.\n\n112\n00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.110\nI love how you're like that's\njust my default action.\n\n113\n00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.118\nYeah like right here, in this column C.\n\n114\n00:06:17.118 --> 00:06:21.180\nI know that there needs to be a little\nbit more space, but how much?\n\n115\n00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:27.050\nIf you come in between the columns and you\ndouble-click, click, click, it AutoFits.\n\n116\n00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:33.810\nIt automatically fits that column to\nbe as wide as the widest value, neat.\n\n117\n00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.710\nOkay, so the same thing here.\n\n118\n00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.350\nNotice that my column is too wide.\n\n119\n00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:42.010\nI could do it in reverse, I guess\nyou could say, it will double-click.\n\n120\n00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:45.474\nAnd it will just make it as\nwide as it needs to be, neat.\n\n121\n00:06:45.474 --> 00:06:50.170\nNow the cool thing is if I can\ndo this with multiple columns.\n\n122\n00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:54.300\nIf I click, hold and\ndrag between A, B, C and D, and\n\n123\n00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:59.685\nthen come in between any of those columns,\nit will AutoFit all of them.\n\n124\n00:06:59.685 --> 00:07:01.110\nOoh, that can be kinda cool.\n\n125\n00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:06.420\nNow, I just selected four of them,\nbut remember this top button up here,\n\n126\n00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.218\nclick that to select everything.\n\n127\n00:07:08.218 --> 00:07:11.230\nThen just double-click,\ndoesn't matter which\n\n128\n00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.690\ncolumn you go in between as long as you\nget the line with the two pointed arrows.\n\n129\n00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.680\nYou double-click, and then it will go\nahead, and notice how these got a little\n\n130\n00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.730\nsmaller and everything,\nbecause I don't have any headings.\n\n131\n00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.440\nSo I don't have the word state.\n\n132\n00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.190\nIf I had the word state in that top\ncolumn, it would change the width and\n\n133\n00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:27.850\neverything like that.\n\n134\n00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:33.037\nSo that's pretty cool,\nI love autofitting, it's nice to do.\n\n135\n00:07:33.037 --> 00:07:38.370\nYou can do the same thing with your\nrow heights and the autofitting.\n\n136\n00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:42.910\nFor example, if I came in between\nthe row 1 and 2, click, hold and\n\n137\n00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:47.790\ndrag, notice that I can\nmake the row higher.\n\n138\n00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:50.012\nWe'll come back around to that when\nwe talk about merging cells and\n\n139\n00:07:50.012 --> 00:07:50.933\nalignment in a little bit.\n\n140\n00:07:50.933 --> 00:07:55.742\nBut just wanted to tell you that\nyou can double-click on that,\n\n141\n00:07:55.742 --> 00:08:00.293\nand it will AutoFit,\nrow wise not just column wise, cool.\n\n142\n00:08:00.293 --> 00:08:05.243\nKinda going back to the, hey, you know\nwhat, I don't really have A top row\n\n143\n00:08:05.243 --> 00:08:10.540\nwith column headers like, is this\nthe first name, is this the last name?\n\n144\n00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.410\nIs this a phone number?\n\n145\n00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:16.040\nIt looks like it, but\nit might not be, I don't know.\n\n146\n00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.005\nHaving column headers in any of your,\n\n147\n00:08:18.005 --> 00:08:22.150\nlike kind of lists of data\nis pretty important, I feel.\n\n148\n00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:24.800\nEspecially when we get\ninto mail merges and\n\n149\n00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.090\neverything like that, you gotta have it.\n\n150\n00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:30.910\nWell, how do I get that in there,\nwell, you just insert another row.\n\n151\n00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.520\nAnd this is what kind of throws\npeople off, it's like but yeah, but\n\n152\n00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.040\nthat's row one, I mean though,\nyou're gonna have two row ones.\n\n153\n00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:41.030\nNo, these are just references,\nthis is just one big grid.\n\n154\n00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:45.100\nSo if you insert a row or\na column, you're just making,\n\n155\n00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:50.240\nyou're kinda moving things around to\nchange where the stuff lives in the grid.\n\n156\n00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.910\nAnd it's kind of a weird thing, that\npeople can't always wrap their head around\n\n157\n00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:58.560\nthat one of like, one's already there but\nnow it's making another number one?\n\n158\n00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.030\nNo, it's just a reference,\nso that's all we're doing.\n\n159\n00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:06.622\nSo if I wanted to insert another\nrow right here, I'm just going\n\n160\n00:09:06.622 --> 00:09:11.684\nright-click over the row one with\nthat arrow pointing to the right.\n\n161\n00:09:11.684 --> 00:09:14.936\nSo right-click,\nnotice it also does like select it, so\n\n162\n00:09:14.936 --> 00:09:16.982\njust be a little careful with that.\n\n163\n00:09:16.982 --> 00:09:19.908\nAnd I'm going to insert,\nso I click it, and\n\n164\n00:09:19.908 --> 00:09:24.700\nthen see, it's still row one and\nthen everything moves down.\n\n165\n00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:25.291\nWanna do it again?\n\n166\n00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:28.282\nRight-click, insert, cool,\n\n167\n00:09:28.282 --> 00:09:33.180\nwell this is where if I have two of them,\nwhat if I wanted to insert two more?\n\n168\n00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.650\nI really needed four rows.\n\n169\n00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:39.840\nWell if you select two of them,\nthen when you right-click and insert,\n\n170\n00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.400\nyou're gonna insert two more.\n\n171\n00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.480\nSo that can kinda be nice,\nto be able to say, hey,\n\n172\n00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:48.340\nI need to put in two rows\nbetween Frito and Fuego.\n\n173\n00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:53.330\nWell, you need to get one in there\nfirst and then I have a blank row,\n\n174\n00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.420\nand then I can select it again.\n\n175\n00:09:55.420 --> 00:10:01.070\nSo you can kinda like, I need four more or\ntwo more, you insert and now I have four.\n\n176\n00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:05.046\nSo you can start kinda do\nit in exponentially, right?\n\n177\n00:10:05.046 --> 00:10:06.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's an exponential growth.\n\n178\n00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:12.891\nIf you continue selecting all the ones\nthat are now available as blank rows,\n\n179\n00:10:12.891 --> 00:10:18.552\nit'll be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256,\n\n180\n00:10:18.552 --> 00:10:23.514\n512, 1024, 2048, 4096, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay if you-\n\n181\n00:10:23.514 --> 00:10:24.152\n&gt;&gt; 8192.\n\n182\n00:10:24.152 --> 00:10:26.893\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You surpass me, Mr.\n\n183\n00:10:26.893 --> 00:10:30.260\nMath guy.\n&gt;&gt; But it's a very common rows pattern and\n\n184\n00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.650\nyou gonna actually got a lot of rows fast,\n\n185\n00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:35.230\nif you do need that many.\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, so\n\n186\n00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:37.400\ngood thing to know about\nthat you can insert it.\n\n187\n00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:41.740\nNow, if I messed up,\nyou can always undo, I can undo,\n\n188\n00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:44.360\nundo, and cuz I really just wanted one.\n\n189\n00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:48.270\nCuz then I can go ahead and\nput in like first, last, and everything.\n\n190\n00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:52.550\nYou don't have to watch me type for right\nnow, I think you're getting the idea.\n\n191\n00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:57.396\nSame thing with you columns, like I really\nneed to have like a middle name and\n\n192\n00:10:57.396 --> 00:10:58.920\nI forgot to put that in.\n\n193\n00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.650\nNow which place do you need it to be?\n\n194\n00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:06.110\nI want it between Alice and\nWonderpows, so between A and B.\n\n195\n00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:10.750\nSo you select column B,\nbecause when you insert or\n\n196\n00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.210\nyou could just go ahead and\nright click directly on column B.\n\n197\n00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:15.990\nWhen you insert,\nit's always gonna go to the left.\n\n198\n00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:17.240\nIt does not go to the right.\n\n199\n00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.890\nSo if you select column A, let me undo.\n\n200\n00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:23.620\nIf I select column A and\ninsert, it's gonna go in front.\n\n201\n00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:27.580\nAnd notice now everything that was in\ncolumn A, gets moved over to column B.\n\n202\n00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:32.478\nAnd now I have column A to be able\nto insert like maybe a title, right?\n\n203\n00:11:32.478 --> 00:11:34.890\nMr. and Mrs., that kind of thing.\n\n204\n00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:40.074\nSo those are different ways\nyou can insert, do be careful,\n\n205\n00:11:40.074 --> 00:11:46.814\nwe did talk about this in our copy paste\nepisode about if you select a column and\n\n206\n00:11:46.814 --> 00:11:51.910\nthen copy it, and\nthen right click and try to insert.\n\n207\n00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:55.670\nNotice insert versus insert copied cells.\n\n208\n00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:58.960\nWatch what happens when I\ninsert the copied cells.\n\n209\n00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.238\nWell, it just moved everything over and\nthat's good and\n\n210\n00:12:02.238 --> 00:12:05.515\nthat would, I'm not going to\nover all of them again, but\n\n211\n00:12:05.515 --> 00:12:09.495\ndefinitely go back and watch the cut,\ncopy, paste if you haven't.\n\n212\n00:12:09.495 --> 00:12:14.061\nCuz we do talk about this and it can get\na little wonky if you're not very careful,\n\n213\n00:12:14.061 --> 00:12:15.203\nso just know about,\n\n214\n00:12:15.203 --> 00:12:19.330\nsometimes you need to put in blank\ncolumn before you put stuff in.\n\n215\n00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:24.030\nCuz it's kinda the whole doing\nfull columns versus cells.\n\n216\n00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:28.270\nIt can get a little weird, so\nI'm just gonna leave that as go back and\n\n217\n00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:31.816\nwatch that one if you haven't.\n&gt;&gt; And to some extent, Vonne, try it out,\n\n218\n00:12:31.816 --> 00:12:34.879\nsee what happens and\nwell if you panic, command Z and\n\n219\n00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:36.758\nautomatic command Z or Ctrl Z for\n\n220\n00:12:36.758 --> 00:12:40.214\nother platforms and go, evacuate I'm gone.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n221\n00:12:40.214 --> 00:12:42.224\n&gt;&gt; And then try something else to see if\n\n222\n00:12:42.224 --> 00:12:44.510\nit achieves the desired results.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n223\n00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:45.800\nwhich I just did while he was talking.\n\n224\n00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.630\nI just did command Z,\ncommand, Z command Z,\n\n225\n00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:49.480\nbecause I'm right back to where I started.\n\n226\n00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.180\nCool, so let's move on to another thing\nabout working within our worksheet.\n\n227\n00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:57.716\nBecause we're talking about selecting,\ncolumn width, and row height,\n\n228\n00:12:57.716 --> 00:13:00.240\nadding, you could also delete, right.\n\n229\n00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:04.420\nIf I don't want to have, you know what,\nI don't need their phone numbers anymore.\n\n230\n00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:05.550\nJust don't need them.\n\n231\n00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.980\nYou can right click and\nyou can delete it, and then it goes away.\n\n232\n00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:10.740\nNotice it's gonna give you like,\nare you sure you wanna do this?\n\n233\n00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.030\nIt's just gonna let you do it.\n\n234\n00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:17.120\nNow you can undo, so\nit's not a permanent like you can't go\n\n235\n00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:22.380\nback in this one, but that is exactly\nwhat it means by deleting a column.\n\n236\n00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:26.100\nYou could select multiple columns like,\nhey I don't need this anymore, so\n\n237\n00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.760\nI can delete that out.\n\n238\n00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.530\nYou can do the same thing with your rows.\n\n239\n00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:31.890\nI don't need these, I can delete it and\n\n240\n00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:33.990\nthen I'm gonna undo cuz\nI really do need it.\n\n241\n00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:37.210\nAnd the other thing is hiding, okay,\n\n242\n00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:40.490\ncuz I don't really wanna delete it but\nI wanna hide it.\n\n243\n00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:43.030\nThis can get a little weird, too.\n\n244\n00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:47.613\nOkay, Justin is over there shaking his\nhead, let me just show you how to do it.\n\n245\n00:13:47.613 --> 00:13:50.740\nAnd then a lot of times people go, well\nthen why would I ever want to do this?\n\n246\n00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:52.370\nWe'll come back around to that.\n\n247\n00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:57.191\nLet's say, I don't need to see their\nteam name and their zip code, or\n\n248\n00:13:57.191 --> 00:13:59.984\nwhatever reason, just don't want to.\n\n249\n00:13:59.984 --> 00:14:03.980\nI'm gonna click hold and drag across and\nI'm going to then right-click.\n\n250\n00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:08.540\nSo I'm selecting the columns\nthat I want to hide.\n\n251\n00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:11.000\nNotice down here,\nthere is an option for hide.\n\n252\n00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.810\nSo you go ahead and\nclick it and it hides it.\n\n253\n00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:18.950\nNow do take notice in this one,\nit's going E, F, G, J.\n\n254\n00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:22.740\nWe're missing some letters,\nyep, we are and\n\n255\n00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:25.960\nyou also see like,\nlet me kinda click over here.\n\n256\n00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:32.310\nNotice that big kind of,\n[LAUGH] green, I almost said red.\n\n257\n00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:34.220\nThat is not red.\n\n258\n00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.950\nThat big green line right there.\n\n259\n00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:40.880\nSo that is indicating to you that\nyou have hidden rows, columns.\n\n260\n00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.508\nWhy do I keep saying rows?\n\n261\n00:14:42.508 --> 00:14:47.013\n[LAUGH] Okay, this is the one that's kinda\nstrange, pretty easy straightforward to\n\n262\n00:14:47.013 --> 00:14:50.700\nhide, but when you unhide,\nlet's just go ahead and unhide it.\n\n263\n00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.597\nOkay, let's go ahead and unhide it.\n\n264\n00:14:55.597 --> 00:14:58.110\nWhy is it not unhiding?\n\n265\n00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:03.440\nThis is the little trick is,\nwhere does H and\n\n266\n00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:09.960\nI, what it is hiding, is between G and J.\n\n267\n00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:14.350\nSo you have to select the starting and\n\n268\n00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:19.030\nending if you wanna say, of where\nthose columns are hiding inside of.\n\n269\n00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:24.270\nSo once you've select those and\nthen unhide, then they come back.\n\n270\n00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:27.650\nSo that's the trick of unhiding.\n&gt;&gt; I\n\n271\n00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:30.450\ndon't know if this make any sense\nto you but I feel like I need to.\n\n272\n00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:33.640\nIf you wanna know what kind\nof thing is on your sandwich,\n\n273\n00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:37.960\nyou're gonna grab both pieces of bread and\nspread it apart to see what's inside.\n\n274\n00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.580\nSo that's kind of a hokey\nway to think about it,\n\n275\n00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.170\nbut this used to be\na different behavior as far as\n\n276\n00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:46.180\nindicating that something was hidden\nin old versions of Excel, right?\n\n277\n00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:47.450\nAt least they give you the green bar.\n\n278\n00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:50.400\nI remember looking at old Excel\nwhere I was like, that's weird.\n\n279\n00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:56.710\nThere are missing letters, and then you\nhad to hover just right and right-click.\n\n280\n00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:59.450\nI do like this a lot\nbetter than it used to be.\n\n281\n00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:01.542\n&gt;&gt; When he just said that, I mean,\n\n282\n00:16:01.542 --> 00:16:04.101\ncould I right click on that and unhide?\n\n283\n00:16:04.101 --> 00:16:06.660\nNow, okay,\nsorry cuz I was like could you do that?\n\n284\n00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:08.159\n&gt;&gt; And, but it didn't hide I.\n\n285\n00:16:08.159 --> 00:16:09.129\n&gt;&gt; It all did.\n\n286\n00:16:09.129 --> 00:16:11.603\n&gt;&gt; And you can probably unhide it again,\n\n287\n00:16:11.603 --> 00:16:14.010\nso it's like a one by one uncollect.\n\n288\n00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:17.450\nI actually prefer the method\nthat you showed us.\n\n289\n00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:19.350\n&gt;&gt; I've never actually tried that.\n\n290\n00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:22.705\nI've only ever done it by selecting\nwhat is hiding in between.\n\n291\n00:16:22.705 --> 00:16:27.294\nSo, and you were just on a roll\ncuz I notice the fill series one.\n\n292\n00:16:27.294 --> 00:16:29.996\n[LAUGH] And I was just like,\nI am taking all of these.\n\n293\n00:16:29.996 --> 00:16:33.825\nSo, and I have heard people\nsay that I cannot even bother\n\n294\n00:16:33.825 --> 00:16:38.146\nabout selecting the columns or\nthe rows that they're hiding,\n\n295\n00:16:38.146 --> 00:16:43.060\nCuz I could go ahead and do this,\nI could hide all of these, right?\n\n296\n00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:46.463\nAnd then I can come over here and\nhide these.\n\n297\n00:16:46.463 --> 00:16:49.628\nWhat I have sent people,\nto say I just select the whole sheet and\n\n298\n00:16:49.628 --> 00:16:52.760\nI just say go ahead, wait,\nthat's the wrong one.\n\n299\n00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.850\nI will go ahead and unhide here, and\n\n300\n00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:58.390\nthen unhide here,\nit's like I'm just everything.\n\n301\n00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:00.338\nI don't care where they're at.\n\n302\n00:17:00.338 --> 00:17:02.568\nSo you select the whole sheet and\nthen go ahead and do this.\n\n303\n00:17:02.568 --> 00:17:04.070\nSo I sent, maybe a little bit easier to,\n\n304\n00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:05.715\ncuz maybe you don't know where\nthey're hiding in between.\n\n305\n00:17:05.715 --> 00:17:10.240\nEspecially,if we have a ton of rows\njust get out and just get all of them.\n\n306\n00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.220\nCome on out guys, let's see what you got.\n\n307\n00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.530\nSo that's why you have unhide.\n\n308\n00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:18.320\nAnd then I always get the question,\nwhy would she wanna hide this?\n\n309\n00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:21.012\nI actually do it a lot, printing, okay?\n\n310\n00:17:21.012 --> 00:17:26.440\nBecause I wanna go ahead and print out\nthe first and last and their department.\n\n311\n00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:29.570\nI don't need all of this, I don't need it.\n\n312\n00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:33.530\nSo, instead of doing like print area,\nI know there's other ways to do it.\n\n313\n00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:38.240\nBut what I will do is I'd just say hey, or\neven maybe this, I need their team name.\n\n314\n00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.710\nSo I just hide these and then go ahead and\n\n315\n00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:44.700\nprint it cuz it's not\ngonna print hidden stuff.\n\n316\n00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:49.490\nSo I print this and then come back later\nand then I go ahead and unhide it later.\n\n317\n00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:51.590\nSo that's why I use it.\n\n318\n00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:54.580\nIt is not meant for security purposes.\n\n319\n00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:58.850\nIf you have sensitive information\nthere when you hide it,\n\n320\n00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:00.340\nyou're not locking anything.\n\n321\n00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:03.150\nSo, don't do it for\nsecurity purposes, it's more of just\n\n322\n00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:05.890\na visual and for printing.\n&gt;&gt; Now, Von I can give you an alternative\n\n323\n00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:10.310\nperspective if you're collecting data,\nI need those analytics.\n\n324\n00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:14.850\nSometimes, they don't quite get there, I\ndon't think, they're still a lot of more.\n\n325\n00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:17.460\nI would have formulas that\nwere incredibly complex and so\n\n326\n00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.990\nI would have intermediate\nvalues as columns.\n\n327\n00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:24.140\nThen I don't really care about those in\nthe final report, but I've used those for\n\n328\n00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.260\nthe final calculation.\n\n329\n00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:30.127\nSo then, I'll just hide those columns and\nbe like they're behind the scenes,\n\n330\n00:18:30.127 --> 00:18:32.480\nthey're there but\nI just remove them afterwards.\n\n331\n00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:36.590\nAnd it allows me to focus on a little\nbitty pieces instead of going,\n\n332\n00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:38.690\nnow where is that parenthesis again?\n\n333\n00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:42.700\nI'm kinda jumping ahead here a little bit\nbut I have done that in my professional\n\n334\n00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.630\ncareer when I've used Excel.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n335\n00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:46.320\nyou just need to see the important parts.\n\n336\n00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:49.230\nThe things that really matter,\nI don't need to see all the work.\n\n337\n00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:51.460\nEven though Matthew,\nshow your work, show your work.\n\n338\n00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:52.592\nNo, just hide it.\n\n339\n00:18:52.592 --> 00:18:54.120\n[LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n340\n00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:54.630\nCool.\n\n341\n00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:58.546\nEverything that we just talked about\nlike the selecting, the hiding,\n\n342\n00:18:58.546 --> 00:19:00.057\nthe inserting, all that.\n\n343\n00:19:00.057 --> 00:19:04.888\nYou could do all of this through\nthe ribbon and/or the menu, so\n\n344\n00:19:04.888 --> 00:19:10.629\nup here on the home tab, you notice over\nhere on the other side to the right,\n\n345\n00:19:10.629 --> 00:19:17.310\nnotice we have some other buttons right\nhere for the insert, delete and format.\n\n346\n00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:20.760\nSo you can see,\nI can insert rows or columns.\n\n347\n00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:23.880\nI could also delete row or columns.\n\n348\n00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.964\nI could also go ahead and format them.\n\n349\n00:19:25.964 --> 00:19:29.948\nNotice I could do the row height,\nthe column width, the unhide,\n\n350\n00:19:29.948 --> 00:19:31.680\nall that kind of fun stuff.\n\n351\n00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:35.570\nI'll say, I don't think I've\nactually ever used those buttons,\n\n352\n00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:38.320\nI've always used them like\ndirected on the sheet.\n\n353\n00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:41.530\nAnd go into the columns and\nrows and going from there,\n\n354\n00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:46.000\nI believe you can also go into the Menu,\nyes, okay.\n\n355\n00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.010\nFormat &gt; Rows &gt; Columns, again,\nI just don't do it that way.\n\n356\n00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:52.410\nBut wanted to throw that out\nthere in case you were wondering.\n\n357\n00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:57.240\nLet's move over into some merging, uh-huh.\n\n358\n00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.300\nThis is another one that gets\npeople a little weird too.\n\n359\n00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:04.290\nWhen you merge cells,\nwhat do you do when you merge?\n\n360\n00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:05.358\nBring them all together, right?\n\n361\n00:20:05.358 --> 00:20:06.860\nYou fuse them together.\n\n362\n00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:10.250\nLike this, across the top,\nChristmas Cats Weekly Sales.\n\n363\n00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:13.500\nNow notice when I clicked on it,\nI don't know if you can see it,\n\n364\n00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.060\nbut it highlights this whole cell.\n\n365\n00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:20.760\nBut this whole cell is going across row,\ncolumns.\n\n366\n00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.320\nMan, I really want to call\nthose things rows today.\n\n367\n00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:29.030\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, it's all\nthe way across, but this is one cell.\n\n368\n00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:31.790\nThey're merged together, okay?\n\n369\n00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:37.464\nFor example down here, notice this one,\nthis is one large cell, okay?\n\n370\n00:20:37.464 --> 00:20:42.540\nThis is merged across one,\ntwo, three rows.\n\n371\n00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:43.563\nYou got that one, right?\n\n372\n00:20:43.563 --> 00:20:45.630\nOne, two, three columns.\n\n373\n00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:47.700\nSo, we've got a merged cell, okay?\n\n374\n00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.210\nThat's exactly what they're called.\n\n375\n00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:52.460\nSo, how do I make that happen?\n\n376\n00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.820\nLet's move over, sorry,\nlet me zoom out a little bit.\n\n377\n00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:57.660\nWe're gonna move back over\nto our modifier worksheet.\n\n378\n00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:59.340\nI'm gonna go over to sheet three.\n\n379\n00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:02.860\nSo this is where\nChristmas Cats Weekly Sales.\n\n380\n00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:06.420\nNow, notice this one,\nit only lives in cell A1.\n\n381\n00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:12.380\nI know because when I click on cell B1,\nI don't have anything in the formula bar.\n\n382\n00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:15.150\nSo this is where it lives,\nokay, that's great.\n\n383\n00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:21.240\nIf I wanted to merge this,\nI wanted to merge these cells,\n\n384\n00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:26.510\nyou have to think of where you\nwant them to start and stop, okay?\n\n385\n00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:28.720\nHow many cells do I want to merge?\n\n386\n00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:33.700\nSo if I click + hold + drag and\nI go over to here.\n\n387\n00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:36.240\nI can now,\nright in the middle of our home tab,\n\n388\n00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.800\nI guess it's a little\nbit more there's left.\n\n389\n00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.970\nThere's an alignment group and\nthere's merge in center.\n\n390\n00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:44.670\nIf you drop that down,\nnotice you have merge in center,\n\n391\n00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:47.930\nyou also have merge across,\nmerge cells, unmerge.\n\n392\n00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:51.810\nI'm just checking off merge\nright now just you can see it.\n\n393\n00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:55.360\nSo, if I click on merge cells,\nwhat just happened?\n\n394\n00:21:55.360 --> 00:22:02.770\nNotice this is one whole cell right now,\nit goes all the way across as one big one.\n\n395\n00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:07.249\nIf I took this and unmerged it, okay?\n\n396\n00:22:07.249 --> 00:22:09.605\nThen it goes back to being one,\ntwo, three,\n\n397\n00:22:09.605 --> 00:22:12.000\nit's just individual cells again, right?\n\n398\n00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.698\nThat's the idea behind merging your cells,\n\n399\n00:22:15.698 --> 00:22:21.710\npretty simple, right?\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty simple, but I'm gonna ask.\n\n400\n00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:25.580\nWhat if that information was\non the right hand most cell?\n\n401\n00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:26.740\nDoes that behavior change?\n\n402\n00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:29.620\nBecause I feel like in the older versions,\nwhen I've done this before,\n\n403\n00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.770\nI've got burned on this.\n&gt;&gt; Like if it was over here?\n\n404\n00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:33.460\n&gt;&gt; If it's over here and\n\n405\n00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:35.520\nyou still have the same selected cells,\nand\n\n406\n00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.408\nthen you'd merge.\n&gt;&gt; Just regular merge.\n\n407\n00:22:38.408 --> 00:22:41.120\n&gt;&gt; Yep just regular merge.\n\n408\n00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:45.022\nOkay, all right.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz now it's treating this as one cell.\n\n409\n00:22:45.022 --> 00:22:52.298\nSo, cuz it aligns to the left of the cell,\nif I made this column really wide,\n\n410\n00:22:52.298 --> 00:22:57.950\nright, it's still to the left\nof that cell correct?\n\n411\n00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:03.200\nSo when you go here it's not\ngonna stay within a same place\n\n412\n00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:08.120\nbecause the cell starts way over there,\nso that's what it's doing\n\n413\n00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:12.900\ndoes that make sense?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah okay, that makes sense,\n\n414\n00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:18.310\nwhat if I had text at the beginning and\nthe ending cell that I have selected?\n\n415\n00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:20.090\nDoes that change the behavior?\n\n416\n00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:22.778\nCuz I'm trying to reproduce\nsomething that has made me angry\n\n417\n00:23:22.778 --> 00:23:23.600\nbefore.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n418\n00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.585\n&gt;&gt; And I haven't won\n\n419\n00:23:24.585 --> 00:23:25.180\nyet, so-\n\n420\n00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:26.203\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n421\n00:23:26.203 --> 00:23:28.023\n&gt;&gt; So here we have Christmas Cats in A and\n\n422\n00:23:28.023 --> 00:23:29.445\nwe have Justin in H, right?\n\n423\n00:23:29.445 --> 00:23:32.240\nI guess I should put you\nover in J shouldn't I?\n\n424\n00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.090\nBut that's okay.\n\n425\n00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:37.499\nWe're gonna go ahead and take this, and\nthen we're going to merge the cells.\n\n426\n00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.980\nYes, if you have multiple data\n\n427\n00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:48.420\nwithin the cells that you are trying\nto merge, it's saying hey,\n\n428\n00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:53.360\nit's only keeping the upper left value and\nit will discard the other.\n\n429\n00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.255\nSo guess what Justin?\n\n430\n00:23:55.255 --> 00:23:57.924\nYou've got moved out.\n\n431\n00:23:57.924 --> 00:24:00.190\n[LAUGH] I know I'm sorry.\n\n432\n00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:01.550\nSo Christmas Cats wins.\n\n433\n00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:05.995\nBut yes, that is a really good point to\nmake that if you are merging cells with\n\n434\n00:24:05.995 --> 00:24:09.180\nmultiple data it's not gonna like that.\n\n435\n00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:12.859\nSo you need to clear out\nthe parts that you don't want.\n\n436\n00:24:12.859 --> 00:24:16.070\nYou gotta think about this a little\nbit ahead of time, that kinda thing.\n\n437\n00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:18.780\nSo that's what's going to\nhappen with your merging.\n\n438\n00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:21.060\nThese are great examples,\nby the way, Justin.\n\n439\n00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:23.720\nSo the other one that I remember\n\n440\n00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:26.350\nwould always throw people\noff is the merge and center.\n\n441\n00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:29.150\nThink about it.\n\n442\n00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:30.630\nOkay, we saw the merge.\n\n443\n00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:34.500\nIt's like okay, just merge it straight up,\njust one big cell.\n\n444\n00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:39.770\nWell, when you merge and center,\nwhat you're getting into is alignment.\n\n445\n00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:41.980\nLet's just for fun,\nlet's just take this one.\n\n446\n00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:45.050\nI'm just gonna type in, I always do that.\n\n447\n00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:48.150\nAlways hold the Shift too long,\nso let's take Vonn.\n\n448\n00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:52.210\nI'm going to make this column wider,\nand I'm gonna put it here.\n\n449\n00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:53.480\nIt's to the left cell, isn't it?\n\n450\n00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.820\nWhat if I wanted that in\nthe middle of the cell?\n\n451\n00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:57.240\nWhat do you think I'm gonna hit up here,\n\n452\n00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:00.610\nJustin?\n&gt;&gt; The one you're on, right there.\n\n453\n00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:02.580\nI don't know if this is\na trick question or,\n\n454\n00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:03.290\nor-\n&gt;&gt; It's not.\n\n455\n00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:03.900\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that one,\n\n456\n00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:05.960\nput that one.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, correct.\n\n457\n00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:07.450\nGoes in the center, doesn't it?\n\n458\n00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:08.600\nIt totally does.\n\n459\n00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:11.510\nWhat do you think this button\nright here is going to do?\n\n460\n00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:13.230\n&gt;&gt; That is a right justified.\n\n461\n00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:14.320\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it is.\n\n462\n00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.170\nJustified, aligned, same thing.\n\n463\n00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:23.260\nSo we have the left, center, and right\nalignment, or justification horizontally.\n\n464\n00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:26.660\nThis is something in code\nthat comes over from Word.\n\n465\n00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:30.295\nI feel it's very intuitive, but\nyou might not have ever seen them.\n\n466\n00:25:30.295 --> 00:25:33.450\nSo I'm not gonna ever assume,\ncuz you know what happens.\n\n467\n00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:36.170\nSo when I click these different buttons,\nit's taking to the left, center, or\n\n468\n00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:38.420\nright of the cell.\n\n469\n00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:43.140\nSo, well, then, if we know that,\nwhat do you think's gonna happen, sorry,\n\n470\n00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:47.450\nwhen I zoom out, if I select this and\nI click Merge and Center?\n\n471\n00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:48.720\nWhat is it gonna do?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n472\n00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.200\nI think it's gonna merge all those cells,\nand\n\n473\n00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.390\ninstead of pushing it to the right\nit's gonna behind the scenes click\n\n474\n00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:54.855\nthe center.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the other right.\n\n475\n00:25:54.855 --> 00:25:57.599\n&gt;&gt; The left, yeah, you know what I mean?\n\n476\n00:25:57.599 --> 00:25:59.155\n[LAUGH] The left.\n\n477\n00:25:59.155 --> 00:26:01.725\nMaybe it's your right depending\non how you're looking at me.\n\n478\n00:26:01.725 --> 00:26:03.929\nIt's going to now cause\nthat to be centered.\n\n479\n00:26:03.929 --> 00:26:05.085\n&gt;&gt; Correct, exactly.\n\n480\n00:26:05.085 --> 00:26:06.505\nJust what happened here.\n\n481\n00:26:06.505 --> 00:26:08.525\nSo I'm just gonna take this.\n\n482\n00:26:08.525 --> 00:26:12.115\nI will merge it, and\nit will automatically center the content.\n\n483\n00:26:12.115 --> 00:26:14.595\nSo it's just like one less\nstep if you wanted to.\n\n484\n00:26:14.595 --> 00:26:16.185\nI could have just as easily.\n\n485\n00:26:16.185 --> 00:26:18.740\nI did an undo.\n&gt;&gt; Merge the cells and\n\n486\n00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:20.450\nthen click the Center button, okay?\n\n487\n00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:25.550\nCuz you have to think about just like when\nyou click Center on a paragraph in Word,\n\n488\n00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:28.040\nit's centering between the margins, right?\n\n489\n00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.828\nThe width of the paper.\n\n490\n00:26:29.828 --> 00:26:34.760\nYou have to create like the width of your\npaper that you want it centered across.\n\n491\n00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.420\nSo that's something\nthat always reminds me,\n\n492\n00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:40.260\nthis is how much I want it to go across.\n\n493\n00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:44.950\nSo that is Merge and Merge and Center.\n\n494\n00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:46.560\nWe also did a little bit of the alignment.\n\n495\n00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:48.030\nLets do a few more things,\n\n496\n00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:52.430\nlike this right here talks about sales\nbeing really low and everything.\n\n497\n00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:55.430\nI'm gonna make this one big cell,\nwe saw that in the example.\n\n498\n00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:58.170\nSo, I'm gonna click+hold+drag,\nand go to about right there.\n\n499\n00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:00.560\nThat might be enough.\n\n500\n00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:01.120\nGo ahead and click,\n\n501\n00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:06.040\nI'm just gonna do Merge, and\nthen I don't know what just happened.\n\n502\n00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.860\nI know there's a lot text in there.\n\n503\n00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:10.770\nWhy is it not doing that, Justin?\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna guess that we have now\n\n504\n00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:15.190\nan overflow issue where I\nget the cut off of overflow.\n\n505\n00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:16.050\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\n\n506\n00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:19.866\nhow do we fix this?\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna say turn on Word Wrap.\n\n507\n00:27:19.866 --> 00:27:21.670\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly, good job.\n\n508\n00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:25.280\nRight above Merge and Center,\nthere's a button for Wrap Text.\n\n509\n00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:28.560\nWhen I click Wrap Text,\nit's exactly what's gonna do, okay?\n\n510\n00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.440\nSo here is my Wrap Text.\n\n511\n00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:33.189\nI know that there is more text in here,\nthough.\n\n512\n00:27:33.189 --> 00:27:37.195\nSo this is where it's like I can\nmake this cell, I can do all that.\n\n513\n00:27:37.195 --> 00:27:39.820\nBut you know what,\nwhy don't I just go ahead and merge more?\n\n514\n00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:43.550\nI just make this a bigger box,\nlike little note thing.\n\n515\n00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:46.720\nSo I just, notice I clicked it,\nbut what did it do?\n\n516\n00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:47.950\nIt turned it off.\n\n517\n00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:50.660\nThen you gotta click it again,\nand there we go.\n\n518\n00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:53.780\nSo now, I went ahead and\ndid Merge and Center.\n\n519\n00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.860\nI'll make this left aligned for fun.\n\n520\n00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.570\nBut at least now I went ahead and\n\n521\n00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:01.520\nmade this whole big cell for\nthis text to sit in.\n\n522\n00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:04.370\nYou could have, by the way,\nhere, let me back up.\n\n523\n00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:06.704\nLet me go back to here.\n\n524\n00:28:07.738 --> 00:28:09.620\nWell, here, okay?\n\n525\n00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:12.980\nI could take this, sorry,\nI need to zoom out.\n\n526\n00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:17.300\nI could come over here and\nmake the row higher.\n\n527\n00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.480\nLike the last row this is in.\n\n528\n00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:20.770\nAgain, this is still one cell.\n\n529\n00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:23.600\nSo that's something else you could do.\n\n530\n00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.890\nI mean, it just really depends on\nwhich way you want to go, okay?\n\n531\n00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:31.100\nMake the cells merge across more cells,\nmake the row higher.\n\n532\n00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:32.890\nTotally fine.\n\n533\n00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:33.397\nAnd then I have this.\n\n534\n00:28:33.397 --> 00:28:34.980\nLet's come back up to this cell.\n\n535\n00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:38.590\nI'm going to make this\na little higher in the row,\n\n536\n00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:41.960\nbecause I'm trying to\nmake a point right now.\n\n537\n00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:47.455\nWhen I center this,\nwhere is it vertically within the cell,\n\n538\n00:28:47.455 --> 00:28:49.505\nJustin?\n&gt;&gt; It’s always at the bottom.\n\n539\n00:28:49.505 --> 00:28:52.485\nI know you’re gonna nail me on\nthe technical terminology on this,\n\n540\n00:28:52.485 --> 00:28:56.435\nbut it’s always gonna take those and push\nit almost like the bottom of a cell is\n\n541\n00:28:56.435 --> 00:28:58.675\nthe line that you’re writing on.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like in text,\n\n542\n00:28:58.675 --> 00:29:01.445\nthat would be the baseline,\nso where the text sits.\n\n543\n00:29:01.445 --> 00:29:06.110\nYes, it’s a bottom vertical\njustification or vertical alignment.\n\n544\n00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:09.480\nThe nice thing is,\nthese buttons right across,\n\n545\n00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:12.928\nthese are this way instead of this way.\n\n546\n00:29:12.928 --> 00:29:16.390\nSo I could align it to the top,\nI can align it to the middle, and\n\n547\n00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:17.490\nI could align it to the bottom.\n\n548\n00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:22.030\nThis is kind of one of my\nbiggest pet peeves, or\n\n549\n00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:24.920\nmy biggest OCD, is vertical justification.\n\n550\n00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:29.490\nI want it to be centered, and so\nI'm always on this button, all the time.\n\n551\n00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:33.758\nSo that's my vertical justification\nwhen I change that row height, okay?\n\n552\n00:29:33.758 --> 00:29:39.171\nSo merge cells, tends to make me\nstart thinking about horizontal and\n\n553\n00:29:39.171 --> 00:29:41.330\nvertical justification.\n\n554\n00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:45.889\nAnd then, the alignment, we'll talk\nabout some more alignments in the next\n\n555\n00:29:45.889 --> 00:29:47.984\nepisode when we start\ngetting into formats.\n\n556\n00:29:47.984 --> 00:29:51.620\nSo don't think I'm not paying\nattention to this particular button.\n\n557\n00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:54.580\nI'm just kinda hitting\nthe main points right now.\n\n558\n00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:58.190\nSo we talked about word wrap,\nthat's a big one for me.\n\n559\n00:29:58.190 --> 00:30:02.940\nBecause like right here,\nRepresentative Weekly Sales.\n\n560\n00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:03.570\nThat's really long.\n\n561\n00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:08.720\nIf I wanted to, I can have it all fit\nin there by just wrapping the text.\n\n562\n00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:13.090\nNow, notice though, that it does start\nbreaking the text in some weird spots.\n\n563\n00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:15.910\nOne, it's because the column width.\n\n564\n00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:18.000\nSo I could go ahead and make this bigger.\n\n565\n00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.085\nI could double-click.\n\n566\n00:30:19.085 --> 00:30:25.010\nBut now, notice how the double-clicking\nof the auto-fit, it doesn't work.\n\n567\n00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:28.080\nAnd I've had people say I don't\nknow why it's not auto-fitting.\n\n568\n00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.490\nI'm like, I bet you have something\nin there that has a wrapped text.\n\n569\n00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:34.920\nCuz I only did one cell in there, right?\n\n570\n00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:37.530\nBut then, the other thing\nis why is this not working?\n\n571\n00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:41.330\nEven if I put this here,\nwell, that one works, okay.\n\n572\n00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:43.660\nSometimes it could be because you\nhave a merged cell in there, too.\n\n573\n00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:45.520\nSo there's different options.\n\n574\n00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:51.770\nBut a lot of times it's either are word\nwrap or merged cell somewhere in there.\n\n575\n00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:54.970\nMerge cells maybe not as much,\nbut I have had it throw me off.\n\n576\n00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:57.070\nSo just be a little aware of that.\n\n577\n00:30:57.070 --> 00:31:02.430\nWhen you take that off, notice how that's\ngonna go ahead and change it, okay?\n\n578\n00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:06.240\nIt's a good and,\nI wouldn't say bad, just different.\n\n579\n00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:08.700\nSo I can make this a little wider.\n\n580\n00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:14.080\nPerfect, that actually broke just fine for\nthe way that I like what that looks.\n\n581\n00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.400\nSo you have to kinda judge it.\n\n582\n00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:18.190\nBut there is another one\nthat I wanted to show you.\n\n583\n00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:20.480\nSo word wrap is really important.\n\n584\n00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:23.140\nI do that a lot, like when I write\nout my episode descriptions,\n\n585\n00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:27.220\nI have it all in one cell, and then I go\nahead and make sure all that whole column.\n\n586\n00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:30.790\nCuz I could have the whole\ncolumn have word wrap on it.\n\n587\n00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:33.670\nIt doesn't have to be just\none cell that has word wrap,\n\n588\n00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:37.250\nyou can do the whole column\nhas that particular thing.\n\n589\n00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:41.390\nWhen we start getting into word wrap,\nI want to talk to you about line breaks.\n\n590\n00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.180\nLet me do this for just two seconds.\n\n591\n00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:46.168\nWe're running out of time, aren't we?\n\n592\n00:31:46.168 --> 00:31:47.730\nOkay, I'll make this quick.\n\n593\n00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:53.460\nIn Word, okay, when you have an Enter,\nan Enter is a full carriage return, right?\n\n594\n00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:57.510\nIf you do a line break, you know about\nthese, Justin, because you do code.\n\n595\n00:31:57.510 --> 00:31:59.350\nSee, right here, this is an Enter.\n\n596\n00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:02.139\nI hit the Enter key,\nmakes a new paragraph.\n\n597\n00:32:02.139 --> 00:32:04.459\nBut if you do Shift+Enter,\n\n598\n00:32:04.459 --> 00:32:10.180\nShift+Enter will create what's\nknown as a manual line break.\n\n599\n00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:13.081\nIt's breaking the line,\nbut not the paragraph.\n\n600\n00:32:13.081 --> 00:32:17.310\nNotice I said Shift+Enter for Word.\n\n601\n00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:19.311\nIt is not the same in Excel.\n\n602\n00:32:19.311 --> 00:32:22.018\nIf you wanted,\nlet me switch back over to Excel.\n\n603\n00:32:22.018 --> 00:32:25.610\nLike right here,\nsee sales were low due to the holiday?\n\n604\n00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:29.000\nI want, Puma was dealing with\nclients being out of town for\n\n605\n00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.340\nthe next week,\nI want that on the next line.\n\n606\n00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:34.500\nI can't hit Enter though, so\nif I double click on here enter does what?\n\n607\n00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.160\nTakes you down to the next cell.\n\n608\n00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:38.959\nSo let's try Shift+Enter.\n\n609\n00:32:38.959 --> 00:32:42.940\nWell Shift+Enter takes you up,\nso what do you do?\n\n610\n00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:47.980\nIt's Alt, you have to do an Alt or\nOption+Enter,\n\n611\n00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:53.940\nthat's how you can do a manual line break\nwithin the contents of your cell and\n\n612\n00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:55.720\nput everything down to the next line.\n\n613\n00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:58.940\nSo it's like the Enter within a cell.\n\n614\n00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:01.812\nI have that a lot of times when I'm\ngoing things with word wrap, so\n\n615\n00:33:01.812 --> 00:33:03.654\nthat's why I wanted to throw it in there.\n\n616\n00:33:03.654 --> 00:33:06.350\nAnd I know you're going to say hey,\nlet's go, but\n\n617\n00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:10.015\nhopefully that gives you some ideas\nabout how to modify a worksheet.\n\n618\n00:33:10.015 --> 00:33:13.373\nWe'll do more throughout the rest of\nthe episodes and we'll probably hit\n\n619\n00:33:13.373 --> 00:33:15.913\non some of these points again.\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne, I know we're running out of\n\n620\n00:33:15.913 --> 00:33:17.515\ntime but I actually have\na question based on all of that.\n\n621\n00:33:17.515 --> 00:33:18.470\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n622\n00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:19.658\n&gt;&gt; Something hit me, so\n\n623\n00:33:19.658 --> 00:33:22.562\nwe have the big long text\nthat had overflow, right?\n\n624\n00:33:22.562 --> 00:33:25.435\nAnd then we started talking\nabout that auto-size.\n\n625\n00:33:25.435 --> 00:33:26.132\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n626\n00:33:26.132 --> 00:33:28.386\n&gt;&gt; What if I have a whole bunch of text\n\n627\n00:33:28.386 --> 00:33:33.297\nand I double click auto-size, am I\ngonna get weird behavior or is it just\n\n628\n00:33:33.297 --> 00:33:36.341\ngoing to go, I'll figure it out?\n&gt;&gt; You know what,\n\n629\n00:33:36.341 --> 00:33:37.693\nI'm gonna undo right there.\n\n630\n00:33:37.693 --> 00:33:41.547\nRight so we have a big long text right\nhere, this is in column F, right?\n\n631\n00:33:41.547 --> 00:33:44.298\nWhen I take that, woo doggy!\n\n632\n00:33:44.298 --> 00:33:48.850\nYes, you are right,\nit will take the largest values.\n\n633\n00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:53.632\nAnd a lot of times happens on column A,\ncuz you have your heading that goes all\n\n634\n00:33:53.632 --> 00:33:57.611\nthe way across, and\nit might be really long, goes to column C.\n\n635\n00:33:57.611 --> 00:34:01.044\nYou double click on A and woop,\nmakes that all really big.\n\n636\n00:34:01.044 --> 00:34:03.443\nYeah, so that's something to notice.\n\n637\n00:34:03.443 --> 00:34:06.914\nBut notice if I come back to here and\n\n638\n00:34:06.914 --> 00:34:11.242\nsay I merge this right,\nand now I auto fit.\n\n639\n00:34:11.242 --> 00:34:15.617\nNow it doesn't do it anymore because\nit doesn't live in F anymore.\n\n640\n00:34:15.617 --> 00:34:18.179\nIt lives in all of these cells,\nso that can actually fit.\n\n641\n00:34:18.179 --> 00:34:21.694\nSo a lot times those headings\nthat I wanna auto fit column A,\n\n642\n00:34:21.694 --> 00:34:26.476\nI'll merge the cells for my title and that\nway I don't have to worry about that and\n\n643\n00:34:26.476 --> 00:34:28.990\nI can still use my auto fit for\nmy column A.\n\n644\n00:34:28.990 --> 00:34:31.937\n[SOUND] So little tip.\n&gt;&gt; That has definitely gotten me\n\n645\n00:34:31.937 --> 00:34:32.686\na bunch of times.\n\n646\n00:34:32.686 --> 00:34:35.815\nAnd it's just, I'm like, yeah I\nforgot that's a bunch of text there.\n\n647\n00:34:35.815 --> 00:34:38.375\nAnd well that's where\nwrapped text comes into play.\n\n648\n00:34:38.375 --> 00:34:42.515\nJust remember, the auto fit starts acting\nwonky when we finally have wrapped text.\n\n649\n00:34:42.515 --> 00:34:45.271\nAnd thank you so much Vonne for\ngiving us those tips and tricks,\n\n650\n00:34:45.271 --> 00:34:47.510\nand as well as highlighting\na few of those gotchas.\n\n651\n00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:49.630\nAnd thank you for\njoining us for this episode.\n\n652\n00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:53.000\nBut it is that time,\nwe are out of time for this episode.\n\n653\n00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.020\nWe're gonna get out of here, so\nsigning off for OfficePro.TV,\n\n654\n00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:57.437\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n655\n00:34:57.437 --> 00:34:58.733\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n656\n00:34:58.733 --> 00:35:05.306\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

OfficePro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.300\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and\n\n4\n00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.320\nwe're continuing on with our Excel\n2016 Essentials for Mac series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.990\nAnd well, we're actually going to be\nlooking at formatting a worksheet\n\n6\n00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.930\nin this episode.\n\n7\n00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.390\nAnd well, just think of it\nas slapping a coat of paint,\n\n8\n00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.200\nI'm probably over-simplifying it.\n\n9\n00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.768\nWell, we have our master painter in studio\ntoday with us to tell us all about it,\n\n10\n00:00:33.768 --> 00:00:34.450\nMs. Vonne Smith.\n\n11\n00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.430\nHow you doing today, Vonne?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing really great, how are you?\n\n12\n00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.670\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic and well,\n\n13\n00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.230\nthese are the types of things that are\nsometimes overlooked, right, formatting.\n\n14\n00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.860\nThat can really set your worksheet, and\n\n15\n00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.850\nwhat you're trying to display to someone,\nworlds apart from someone else.\n\n16\n00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.480\nSo what do we need to concern\nourselves with when we're thinking\n\n17\n00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.810\nabout formatting a worksheet?\n&gt;&gt; What paint to use, basically [LAUGH].\n\n18\n00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.380\nYeah, like what colors, and maybe\nsometimes a little bit is good enough.\n\n19\n00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.700\nYou don't need to overdo it.\n\n20\n00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.320\nSo I think everything when I show you,\nit's gonna end up looking pretty bad,\n\n21\n00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.310\nhonestly [LAUGH].\n\n22\n00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.030\nBut I'm just showing you the limits and\n\n23\n00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.920\nthen how you would like to do it\nappropriately is at your discretion.\n\n24\n00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.440\nSo yeah, formatting, we're gonna be\nmaking colors and fonts and changes and\n\n25\n00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.860\nalignments and\nall sorts of fund stuff, so.\n\n26\n00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.100\nWe're gonna concentrate on what I would\ncall a text formatting in a sense,\n\n27\n00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.070\nnot getting into number formats.\n\n28\n00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.820\nThat's a whole other area of changing how\nsomething looks, like how is it displayed?\n\n29\n00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.900\nBut that is very specific to,\nwell, numbers.\n\n30\n00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.970\nThis is really just any content of a cell.\n\n31\n00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.050\nI guess it could be numbers.\n\n32\n00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.270\nSo I shouldn't limit it to just text.\n\n33\n00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.600\nYou know what, why don't we\njust go ahead and get started.\n\n34\n00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.950\nLet's jump on down here,\nI do have a file that we are going to use.\n\n35\n00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.800\nFormatted worksheet\nsounds like a good one.\n\n36\n00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.850\nSo I will open that up.\n\n37\n00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.840\nAnd up, it didn't open up all the way,\nthat's fine.\n\n38\n00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.210\nYou know we could double-click\non our title bar to go ahead and\n\n39\n00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.400\nfully maximize it to our screen.\n\n40\n00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.890\nI'm also gonna zoom this in a little bit\nso you guys can see this a little clearer.\n\n41\n00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.800\nAnd we're gonna adjust the font\nsize as we go through too, so\n\n42\n00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.390\nthat will help with\nthe visibility as well.\n\n43\n00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:23.850\nSo why don't we start with where we're\ngoing to be formatting any of our cells?\n\n44\n00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.250\nWell, we're gonna be hanging out\na lot on the Home tab of our ribbon.\n\n45\n00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.220\nWe have this group in here, so\nwe have our fonts and colors and\n\n46\n00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.960\nall those kinds of stuff.\n\n47\n00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.729\nBut I do wanna point out\nbefore we even get started.\n\n48\n00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.590\nEverything we're gonna be doing in\nthe next couple of episodes and\n\n49\n00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.250\nactually some that we did in our previous\nepisode when we did our merge cells and\n\n50\n00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.600\nmerge and centers, is all in something\nknown as the format cells dialogue box.\n\n51\n00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.580\nThis is the thing that has been around for\n\n52\n00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.950\na long time before you had ribbons and\neverything.\n\n53\n00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.820\nYou had this dialog box that you would go\nto for all these different options, okay.\n\n54\n00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.340\nSo where is that?\n\n55\n00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.200\nCouple different places you can do.\n\n56\n00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.890\nYou can right-click on any cell.\n\n57\n00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.430\nDoesn't matter what\ncell you have selected.\n\n58\n00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.290\nAnd there is Format Cells,\ndown towards the bottom.\n\n59\n00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.990\nAnd that's where you can go.\n\n60\n00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.080\nNotice you also have\nthe shortcut of command one.\n\n61\n00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.860\nSee, it's a very prominent dialogue box.\n\n62\n00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.510\nSo, I guess it went ahead and\nput it in the position there.\n\n63\n00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.240\nSo whoop, let me go ahead and zoom out.\n\n64\n00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.550\nYou also have your Format menu,\nand you have Format cells.\n\n65\n00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.160\nAnd then, I believe in the PC\nworld you have the little,\n\n66\n00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.440\nwhat I call the More button.\n\n67\n00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.660\nIt's the dialogue launcher button.\n\n68\n00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.080\nWe don't have that in a MAC world,\nbut just in case you were looking for\n\n69\n00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.220\nit, it doesn't exist.\n\n70\n00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.535\nProbably should have mentioned that\nin the Interface, may be I did,\n\n71\n00:03:42.535 --> 00:03:44.430\n[SOUND] it's okay, it doesn't exist.\n\n72\n00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.262\nAll right, so that, let's go to it,\n\n73\n00:03:47.262 --> 00:03:52.230\nthis dialog box is going to show\nyou all the different categories.\n\n74\n00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.910\nI say categories, you see it right there,\nbut this is the Number format.\n\n75\n00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.850\nThis is for Alignment, Font,\nBorder, Fill and Protection.\n\n76\n00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.480\nWe won't be getting into protection in\nthis particular series, but we will talk\n\n77\n00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.750\nabout the cell fill, and the the borders,\nand the font, and the alignment.\n\n78\n00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.100\nAnd then in some other episodes\nwe'll talk about number format.\n\n79\n00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.490\nSo you can always come here for\nmore options.\n\n80\n00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:20.709\nMost of the options that we're\ngoing to be doing will be located,\n\n81\n00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.330\nI'm gonna cancel this, on our ribbon.\n\n82\n00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.380\nBut there's a couple extras\nthat are only accessible\n\n83\n00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.430\nthrough that particular dialog box.\n\n84\n00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.180\nSo we'll be going back and\nforth through them, to that box and\n\n85\n00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.330\nthen really on the ribbon.\n\n86\n00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.960\nBut we're just gonna point that out\nto you right from the very start.\n\n87\n00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.230\nAnd then boom, know where we need to go.\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne,\n\n88\n00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.350\nI'm kind of interested because\nI numbers on this page.\n\n89\n00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.430\nBut when you're talking about\nnumber formatting, just to clarify.\n\n90\n00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.520\nWe're actually modifying the presentation\nnumbers and things of that nature.\n\n91\n00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.570\nNot necessarily the cells that\ncontain numbers within them.\n\n92\n00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:56.880\nDo I have that correct?\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n93\n00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.400\nthere are two separate types of formats,\nokay?\n\n94\n00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.030\nBecause like right here, if this is sales,\nhow do you know that these are sales?\n\n95\n00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.960\nDoesn't have a dollar sign,\ndoesn't have two decimal points, and\n\n96\n00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.150\nthose types of things.\n\n97\n00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.060\nSo that would be controlling\nhow your numbers look.\n\n98\n00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.620\nBut let's just start here,\nChristmas Cats Weekly Sales, okay?\n\n99\n00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.150\nThis is a merged cell.\n\n100\n00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.880\nWe know it's a merged cell\nbecause I can see across.\n\n101\n00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.700\nAnd a little button at the top,\nit says Merge &amp; Center.\n\n102\n00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.380\nBut this is a heading, a title.\n\n103\n00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.440\nIt needs to be bigger, different font,\ndifferent color, right?\n\n104\n00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.920\nSo that's the kind of format\nwe're going to concentrate on.\n\n105\n00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.300\nSo let's go ahead and change this\nright up here in the, what is this?\n\n106\n00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.570\nThe font group [LAUGH] up on our ribbon.\n\n107\n00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:39.790\nWe can go and drop this down.\n\n108\n00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:40.560\nThese are our fonts.\n\n109\n00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.060\nThere's, don't get me started talking\nabout fonts we'll be here for days,\n\n110\n00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.530\ncuz there's so much to talk about with\ntype faces, and open type fonts, and\n\n111\n00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.776\ntwo type fonts, and\nligatures, and ordinals, and\n\n112\n00:05:50.776 --> 00:05:54.735\n[LAUGH] Justin's over there going,\nI have no idea what you're talking about.\n\n113\n00:05:54.735 --> 00:05:56.020\nYes, I'm kind of a font dork, so.\n\n114\n00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.685\n[LAUGH] Yeah, it's okay Justin.\n\n115\n00:05:58.685 --> 00:06:01.095\nHey, what font do you like?\n\n116\n00:06:01.095 --> 00:06:03.154\nIs there a font,\nthat you particularly go to?\n\n117\n00:06:03.154 --> 00:06:05.252\n&gt;&gt; I feel like I should troll you and\n\n118\n00:06:05.252 --> 00:06:09.224\nsay Comic Sans MS.\n&gt;&gt; Ooooh, you're going for\n\n119\n00:06:09.224 --> 00:06:14.526\nthe Comic Sans, nice, wait,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n120\n00:06:14.526 --> 00:06:15.202\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n121\n00:06:15.202 --> 00:06:18.800\n&gt;&gt; A, B, C, [LAUGH] alphabetical Vonne.\n\n122\n00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.014\nSo you can see that we have Comic Sans.\n\n123\n00:06:21.014 --> 00:06:23.587\nNow, this is kind of an interesting one,\n\n124\n00:06:23.587 --> 00:06:27.520\nbecause notice how some of our\nfonts have like little flyouts?\n\n125\n00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.220\nFor example, our Cambria font.\n\n126\n00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.320\nAnd notice how this particular, this is\nwhen you start getting into font families.\n\n127\n00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.990\nWhen you have a font and\nthe family, like, sorry,\n\n128\n00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.270\nI don't wanna go too off\nthe rails on this one.\n\n129\n00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:43.070\nBut technically,\n\n130\n00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:47.740\nthere's really nothing in the Comic Sans,\nComic Sans Bold technically doesn't exist.\n\n131\n00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.019\n[SOUND] It does, and that's where,\n\n132\n00:06:51.019 --> 00:06:55.840\nlet me just, just roll with me for\njust a little bit.\n\n133\n00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.260\nYou see these buttons right here.\n\n134\n00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.698\nBold, Italic, right?\n\n135\n00:06:58.698 --> 00:07:05.463\nThese are visual decorations or\neffects that you can put on it.\n\n136\n00:07:05.463 --> 00:07:10.060\nThere are some fonts that do not have,\nif you're talking about like.\n\n137\n00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.090\nDown to the kernel, if you wanna say,\n\n138\n00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:16.530\nof the font family that doesn't have a\nbold or an italic within the font family.\n\n139\n00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.440\nSo they're like sub-fonts.\n\n140\n00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.930\nSo while you could go ahead and\nmake Comic Sans bold and italic,\n\n141\n00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:26.780\nit doesn't truly exist in the true\nessence of the font or the font family.\n\n142\n00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:27.470\nIt's just not a choice.\n\n143\n00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:32.160\nBut since this is Office,\nwe kind of skirt the issue a little bit.\n\n144\n00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.042\nAnd we don't have to really\nworry about all of that.\n\n145\n00:07:35.042 --> 00:07:40.460\nMe, like kind of a font geek, would kinda\nsit there and be like that's not true.\n\n146\n00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.350\nIt's okay, just live with it.\n\n147\n00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:43.420\nSo it's all right.\n\n148\n00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:47.270\nBut some fonts are going to have\nother sub-fonts that are different.\n\n149\n00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:49.090\nNotice you have bold and bold italic.\n\n150\n00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:51.538\nBut then, why do we have a B and\nan I button?\n\n151\n00:07:51.538 --> 00:07:57.063\nAgain, it's a little, it's like apples and\noranges and just kinda putting\n\n152\n00:07:57.063 --> 00:08:02.335\na coat of paint on it even though the wood\nunderneath it is still just wood.\n\n153\n00:08:02.335 --> 00:08:03.154\nMove on, Vonne.\n\n154\n00:08:03.154 --> 00:08:05.575\nAll right, we'll just go ahead and pick.\n\n155\n00:08:05.575 --> 00:08:09.334\nI told you pick a font, and then [LAUGH] I\ntotally didn't listen to you, I'm sorry.\n\n156\n00:08:09.334 --> 00:08:10.754\n&gt;&gt; Well, I could've guessed.\n\n157\n00:08:10.754 --> 00:08:11.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n158\n00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:13.424\n&gt;&gt; I did pick a font that most people\n\n159\n00:08:13.424 --> 00:08:16.082\nwere like,\n[SOUND] I don't know about that one,\n\n160\n00:08:16.082 --> 00:08:16.598\nso.\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n161\n00:08:16.598 --> 00:08:19.617\nit's a common font that everyone loves,\nit's a fun font.\n\n162\n00:08:19.617 --> 00:08:23.240\nSo it is a Microsoft Font, that's okay.\n\n163\n00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.573\nWe have Microsoft Office, and\nthat's why we have it on a Mac computer.\n\n164\n00:08:25.573 --> 00:08:30.080\nSo we'll come back and use some\nfonts like Comic Sans in a minute.\n\n165\n00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.460\nSo right over here, that number 11,\n\n166\n00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:37.050\nwhat do you think that is Justin?\n&gt;&gt; That is the size of the font, but\n\n167\n00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:38.870\nI'm really bad with the units on it.\n\n168\n00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:43.167\nI can't remember if it's points,\nor pixels, or some other unit.\n\n169\n00:08:43.167 --> 00:08:44.312\n&gt;&gt; They're points,\n\n170\n00:08:44.312 --> 00:08:47.850\nI think didn't Don say\nsomething about pitch?\n\n171\n00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.110\nHe used the terminology and\nI'm like what do you mean ten pitch?\n\n172\n00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:51.680\nAnd he was like yeah.\n\n173\n00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.340\nThe measurement and\nthat totally threw me off for a minute.\n\n174\n00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.730\nBut maybe, cuz he's pretty\nold school on computer stuff.\n\n175\n00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.640\nSo they are on points,\n\n176\n00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:02.200\npoints is a measurement system\nthat you just measure fonts in.\n\n177\n00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.460\nI'll leave it at that, but\nthere are 72 points in an inch,\n\n178\n00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.056\nbecause there are six picas in an inch.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n179\n00:09:08.056 --> 00:09:11.210\npica is another measuring system,\ndon't worry about it.\n\n180\n00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:14.410\nWe'll go ahead and choose this,\nhey, 20 is very good than 12, so\n\n181\n00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:15.750\nthat's what you're gonna get.\n\n182\n00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.368\nThese little bumpy buttons right here,\n\n183\n00:09:18.368 --> 00:09:22.218\nI call them bumpy buttons,\nthis is where you can go ahead and\n\n184\n00:09:22.218 --> 00:09:26.626\nbump the size up rather than doing\nthe drop down and change the font.\n\n185\n00:09:26.626 --> 00:09:30.505\nIf you come from PC world, something\nthat PC world that Mac does not have is\n\n186\n00:09:30.505 --> 00:09:33.697\nthat live preview,\nto where you can hover over your fonts and\n\n187\n00:09:33.697 --> 00:09:37.470\nit changes the text to give\nyou a live preview of that.\n\n188\n00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:39.530\nIt just doesn't exist in a Mac world.\n\n189\n00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:41.970\nSo you just have to just know and\n\n190\n00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:46.960\njust click it, change it if you want to.\n&gt;&gt; So notice you do have our bold.\n\n191\n00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.316\nThis is a particular font that whether\nyou put the bold button on it or not,\n\n192\n00:09:50.316 --> 00:09:51.680\nit's not gonna do anything.\n\n193\n00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.216\nI can make it italic, okay?\n\n194\n00:09:53.216 --> 00:09:57.801\nBut if I did change this to,\nlet's just say, just regular Arial, and\n\n195\n00:09:57.801 --> 00:09:59.215\nthen click the bold.\n\n196\n00:09:59.215 --> 00:10:00.735\nSee now, you can see the difference,\n\n197\n00:10:00.735 --> 00:10:02.995\nit just makes it a little\nthicker a little bolder.\n\n198\n00:10:02.995 --> 00:10:06.305\nOkay, I'm just doing an undo to move back.\n\n199\n00:10:06.305 --> 00:10:10.575\nYou also have your underline,\nthis is underlining the text.\n\n200\n00:10:10.575 --> 00:10:14.795\nI'm gonna show you, and know you also\nhave a double underline as well.\n\n201\n00:10:14.795 --> 00:10:18.586\nSee that's not the cell it lives in,\nokay, so\n\n202\n00:10:18.586 --> 00:10:23.555\nthis goes directly under the text,\nthat's what that does.\n\n203\n00:10:23.555 --> 00:10:26.904\nAnd then let's mover to,\nwe'll skip a couple of these buttons, and\n\n204\n00:10:26.904 --> 00:10:27.956\nthen the font color.\n\n205\n00:10:27.956 --> 00:10:31.300\nSo these are the colors that\nit's allowing me to see.\n\n206\n00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:36.750\nNow, why do I have these particular ones,\nit's letting me choose from?\n\n207\n00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:38.637\nThis is connected to the theme.\n\n208\n00:10:38.637 --> 00:10:41.913\nWe will talk about themes\nin the next episode, but\n\n209\n00:10:41.913 --> 00:10:45.354\nthis could change depending\non what theme you have.\n\n210\n00:10:45.354 --> 00:10:48.043\nThe default one is the Office theme, and\n\n211\n00:10:48.043 --> 00:10:51.770\nthat's why you get these\nvery Office friendly colors.\n\n212\n00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:55.330\nWe don't have any neon pinks and\ngreens and purples,\n\n213\n00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.400\nlike something I would like to have.\n\n214\n00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:01.983\nBut we have a theme for that, come\nback and see that in the next episode.\n\n215\n00:11:01.983 --> 00:11:06.410\nBut hey, I really want pink,\nI want this text to be pink.\n\n216\n00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:07.610\nWhere can I get more colors?\n\n217\n00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:09.684\nAnd you guessed it, more colors.\n\n218\n00:11:09.684 --> 00:11:14.576\nNow, this is a Mac-specific way\nof how they kinda treat their,\n\n219\n00:11:14.576 --> 00:11:19.390\nany color picker really is do you\nwant to have your color wheel.\n\n220\n00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:25.389\nIt's all black, that's because it's\nusing lightness or light and brightness.\n\n221\n00:11:25.389 --> 00:11:29.342\nJust pull this to the left and go over\nhere, and then you can go ahead and\n\n222\n00:11:29.342 --> 00:11:31.630\nget your spectrum, okay?\n\n223\n00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:33.180\nThen you also have your sliders.\n\n224\n00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:37.120\nYou have where colors can be in an RGB or\n\n225\n00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.810\nACMYK or in HSV, that's hue,\nsaturation and brightness.\n\n226\n00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.190\nJust start making them back left and\nright.\n\n227\n00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:45.770\nThis gets a little too technical.\n\n228\n00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:48.312\nGet all of these things\nthat I love to talk about,\n\n229\n00:11:48.312 --> 00:11:50.910\nbut I really have to keep myself in check.\n\n230\n00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:54.240\nCuz I can tell you all about\ncolor theory and color spaces,\n\n231\n00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.010\nif you really wanted me to.\n\n232\n00:11:56.010 --> 00:12:00.730\nWe have then, of course, like the apple\npicking of just our regular magenta and\n\n233\n00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:01.770\ngreen.\n\n234\n00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:03.640\nYou can come over here and\npick the little pencils,\n\n235\n00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.900\nI like that they kinda raise up\na little bit, that's always fun.\n\n236\n00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:10.500\nSo there's my strawberry, like that color,\nand then there you go, perfect.\n\n237\n00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:18.200\nSo font, size, color, effects that's\nthe bold and italics, and our underline.\n\n238\n00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:23.150\nCool, if you really wanted to make\nthe strike through, okay, you can.\n\n239\n00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:27.170\nIf you go to the format cells and\nI've seen this happen.\n\n240\n00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:28.530\nYou come over here to font.\n\n241\n00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:32.141\nNotice, there are some buttons over\nhere where it says strike through.\n\n242\n00:12:32.141 --> 00:12:35.108\nSo everything that we just finished doing,\nif you wanted to,\n\n243\n00:12:35.108 --> 00:12:37.346\nyou could come into here and\nit's kinda nice.\n\n244\n00:12:37.346 --> 00:12:40.639\nCuz it gives you a little preview,\nright there, so\n\n245\n00:12:40.639 --> 00:12:45.232\nif I wanted to pick let's just say\nCalibri, and I want it to be Bold, and\n\n246\n00:12:45.232 --> 00:12:48.752\nI want it to be green, and\nI want to be a little smaller,\n\n247\n00:12:48.752 --> 00:12:53.000\nnotice it's giving you this\npreview window what it looks like.\n\n248\n00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.020\nSo you are more than\nwelcome to go ahead and\n\n249\n00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:59.570\ngo through the Format Cells\ndialog box to format your fonts.\n\n250\n00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:05.390\nCool, now, we did talk a little bit\nabout alignment in our previous episode.\n\n251\n00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:07.100\nI just increase the row height.\n\n252\n00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:11.160\nWe talked about our vertical\njustification or vertical alignment.\n\n253\n00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:15.780\nMiddle and top, because we were talking\nabout row height and everything like that.\n\n254\n00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:20.220\nWe also talked about our\nhorizontal alignment a little bit.\n\n255\n00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:24.740\nSo right here, let's select these,\nI wanna format this.\n\n256\n00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:27.040\nWe'll use Comic Sans for\nyou, how about that, okay?\n\n257\n00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:31.620\nSo we will just go ahead\nan choose Comic Sans.\n\n258\n00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.540\nLet's make this a little bit bigger,\nbut right now,\n\n259\n00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.950\nin the cell they are left aligned.\n\n260\n00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:40.962\nAnd I need to make this\ncolumn a little bit wider.\n\n261\n00:13:40.962 --> 00:13:43.870\nI want them to be centered in the cell.\n\n262\n00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:46.620\nSo you can go ahead and\nclick the center aligned or\n\n263\n00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.380\nyou could go with right aligned, okay?\n\n264\n00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:50.769\nJust click the buttons and\nwhere it's going to go ahead and\n\n265\n00:13:50.769 --> 00:13:52.636\nalign the contents of\nthose selected cells.\n\n266\n00:13:52.636 --> 00:13:56.060\nMaybe I'll go ahead and choose Center.\n\n267\n00:13:56.060 --> 00:14:00.027\nThat's fine, but there's one thing we\ndidn't talk about in the other episode and\n\n268\n00:14:00.027 --> 00:14:01.453\nthat's this little button.\n\n269\n00:14:01.453 --> 00:14:03.934\nThis button is changing your orientation,\n\n270\n00:14:03.934 --> 00:14:07.230\nbecause maybe I don't want\nit to go straight across.\n\n271\n00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:08.367\nWhat if I want it to go diagonal?\n\n272\n00:14:08.367 --> 00:14:11.137\nHave you seen check sheets like that,\nJustin,\n\n273\n00:14:11.137 --> 00:14:15.891\nwhere it's like the text is this way?\n&gt;&gt; I'm not only seeing check sheets, but\n\n274\n00:14:15.891 --> 00:14:21.166\nI've seen some people do this and try to\nplace graphics and then use this to say.\n\n275\n00:14:21.166 --> 00:14:23.477\nWell, I have a bunch of datapoints or\n\n276\n00:14:23.477 --> 00:14:27.802\na lot of categorical information\nthat I need to put some sideways, or\n\n277\n00:14:27.802 --> 00:14:32.970\neven straight up and down, because I\nwant you to know that it's this column.\n\n278\n00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:34.330\nAnd instead of reading horizontally, and\n\n279\n00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.660\nthen going down,\nI'm seeing some stylistic choices.\n\n280\n00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:41.110\nBut they are handy for making check\nsheets or times tables, I guess.\n\n281\n00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.737\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n282\n00:14:41.737 --> 00:14:44.084\nI remember it like in elementary school,\nand\n\n283\n00:14:44.084 --> 00:14:47.416\nthere was always kind of up to he side,\nand something like in pe or\n\n284\n00:14:47.416 --> 00:14:51.246\nwhatever like you know checking off\nwhether you did the shuttle run which I\n\n285\n00:14:51.246 --> 00:14:55.250\nwas always horrible at anyways [LAUGH]\nthere we don't need to digress there.\n\n286\n00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:58.854\nBut anyways, we can go ahead and change\nthis to clockwise orientated like this\n\n287\n00:14:58.854 --> 00:15:02.799\neverybody's like this doesn't really fit,\nyou just need to make the row higher.\n\n288\n00:15:02.799 --> 00:15:06.831\nSo if you think about it now if it's in\ndiagonal you're gonna need more height for\n\n289\n00:15:06.831 --> 00:15:08.206\nthat go ahead and fit into.\n\n290\n00:15:08.206 --> 00:15:12.345\nSo you can change it that way, and then\nnotice you can also go the other way as\n\n291\n00:15:12.345 --> 00:15:14.983\nwell.\n&gt;&gt; Now, Vonne, if we turn text wrap,\n\n292\n00:15:14.983 --> 00:15:19.514\nso they didn't have text wrap on, so\nany time I change the orientation,\n\n293\n00:15:19.514 --> 00:15:23.186\nI automatically get overflow\nhidden by default, right?\n\n294\n00:15:23.186 --> 00:15:26.910\nSo that could be some weirdness, so\nwe just have to make that row higher.\n\n295\n00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:29.930\nAnd we can auto fit those just\nlike we normally would, right?\n\n296\n00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:30.490\n&gt;&gt; Yes, now,\n\n297\n00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:32.572\nI put the wrap text on\nto show it will wrap it.\n\n298\n00:15:32.572 --> 00:15:36.818\nBut if I turn it off, yes,\nyou can go ahead and use if it was here,\n\n299\n00:15:36.818 --> 00:15:40.470\nif I double click it,\nit will make it that high, yeah.\n\n300\n00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:44.840\nSo good point about the whole word wrap,\nand whether the fitting,\n\n301\n00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:49.220\nand auto fit, and change in\nthe height if you need it to or not.\n\n302\n00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:53.100\nSo, yes, you do have that, but this is one\nthing that I get from people is all right,\n\n303\n00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.520\nwell I went ahead and made it diagonal.\n\n304\n00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:59.637\nSo now, I wanna go ahead and\nput it back and so,\n\n305\n00:15:59.637 --> 00:16:05.137\nthey go to the left and I click\nthis button and I How do I stop it?\n\n306\n00:16:05.137 --> 00:16:08.570\nIt's kinda like a light switch, you\nturned it on, so you gotta turn it off.\n\n307\n00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:13.360\nWith these selected cells, notice\nthere's a check box, next to that, so\n\n308\n00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.430\nyou just click it again and\nit turns it off.\n\n309\n00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:18.780\nOkay, so that's the biggest,\nlike on or off,\n\n310\n00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.070\nthere's a lot of things\nlike that in Excel.\n\n311\n00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:23.480\nSo just work with that.\n\n312\n00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.490\nAnd maybe you didn't\nwant it to be 45 degrees,\n\n313\n00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:27.460\nmaybe you wanted this to\nbe a different angle.\n\n314\n00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:29.870\nWith the cells selected\nthat you want to format,\n\n315\n00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:32.930\nyou can go into\nthe Format Cells dialog box.\n\n316\n00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:37.700\nAnd on the Alignment tab, not tab,\nI guess it's like a button?\n\n317\n00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:41.290\nOkay, notice you have this little,\ncalled a little diamond.\n\n318\n00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:43.140\nSee this little red diamond here?\n\n319\n00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.980\nThen you can change the degree\nof the orientation.\n\n320\n00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:50.962\nSo if I only want it to be to 30 degree,\nor maybe a 75 degree,\n\n321\n00:16:50.962 --> 00:16:55.104\nyou can go ahead and\nchange that from here and there.\n\n322\n00:16:55.104 --> 00:16:59.618\nAnd also notice that you have\nyour horizontal, your vertical,\n\n323\n00:16:59.618 --> 00:17:03.060\nthe wrap text, the merge cells,\nshrink to fit.\n\n324\n00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:04.430\nShrink to fit can get a little weird.\n\n325\n00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:09.420\nSo if you click OK notice that's where you\ncan go ahead and do some customizations\n\n326\n00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:14.290\nof your orientation for your angle.\n\n327\n00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:17.920\nNotice that this would just take\nyou right to the exact same place.\n\n328\n00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:21.007\nYou can also change like\nyou want the vertical text,\n\n329\n00:17:21.007 --> 00:17:24.530\nmaybe you have a checklist but\nit's a really small column.\n\n330\n00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:27.100\nThey're just check boxes but\nyou have a long title.\n\n331\n00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:31.180\nSo maybe turning it all the way or\nmaybe writing it downwards.\n\n332\n00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:33.310\nYou can do all of that kinda fun stuff.\n\n333\n00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:37.400\nFor example if I took,\nlet me zoom out of this a little bit.\n\n334\n00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.890\nI need to zoom out this way.\n\n335\n00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:46.260\nSo I took these cells and then merged\nthem, and then changed that orientation.\n\n336\n00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:51.060\nYou see that, I can have it right down and\nthat's where it's stacked,\n\n337\n00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:56.170\nrather than this particular one where\nit changes the text to read upwards.\n\n338\n00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:59.010\nSo personal choice in\nhow you want it to look.\n\n339\n00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:00.200\n&gt;&gt; Vonne, I have a confession.\n\n340\n00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:05.230\nI knew about the changing of orientation,\nbut the vertical thing,\n\n341\n00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:09.036\nI've definitely, M, Enter, E, Enter.\n\n342\n00:18:09.036 --> 00:18:10.030\n&gt;&gt; You've done, yeah?\n\n343\n00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:10.863\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n344\n00:18:10.863 --> 00:18:12.599\n&gt;&gt; You kinda made my day nice,\n\n345\n00:18:12.599 --> 00:18:16.840\nand you also kinda made me feel I\nshould have just searched around.\n\n346\n00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.330\nBut these are good things to know so\nI'm glad I know that.\n\n347\n00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:21.350\nIt's a lot less work for me.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n348\n00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:25.610\nit's nice because with those line breaks,\nyou would have had to take them all out.\n\n349\n00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:27.420\nBut now it's like, no, you know what?\n\n350\n00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:30.256\nI just wanna go ahead and take that\noff and now it's regular text again.\n\n351\n00:18:30.256 --> 00:18:34.290\nGood, now you know.\n\n352\n00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:36.270\nLet's move on to some other things.\n\n353\n00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:39.040\nLet's go to our shading.\n\n354\n00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:42.070\nThis is where we're going to get into,\nI call it borders and\n\n355\n00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:44.030\nshading because that's what it is in Word.\n\n356\n00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:48.210\nBut this is really,\nshading is called fill color, okay?\n\n357\n00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:49.970\nSo the little paint bucket.\n\n358\n00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:56.080\nThat's going to change the inside color\nof your selected cells, or single cell.\n\n359\n00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.230\nFor example this one, I had it merged and\nI had it wrapped okay.\n\n360\n00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:02.540\nSo I want to change that fill color.\n\n361\n00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.050\nSelect the effect, got it.\n\n362\n00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:06.260\nAnd then we just change the fill.\n\n363\n00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.570\nYou still have all the same\ncolor options that you had.\n\n364\n00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:11.082\nNotice now I have been\npicking some special colors,\n\n365\n00:19:11.082 --> 00:19:14.586\nit's going in a whole another section for\nrecent colors, that's fun.\n\n366\n00:19:14.586 --> 00:19:20.170\nAnd you could, this is one of\nthose you can but, you know what?\n\n367\n00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:21.410\nJust don't.\n\n368\n00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:25.670\nYou can go into the format cells,\nI'm right-clicking on this.\n\n369\n00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:33.075\nAnd in the fill, you can go ahead and\nstart putting on these pattern styles.\n\n370\n00:19:33.075 --> 00:19:36.310\n[SOUND] Yeah, exactly, I know.\n\n371\n00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:41.130\nI was like, just don't,\nit'll start hurting your eyeballs.\n\n372\n00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:45.220\nAnd if you start formatting your\ncells this way, gosh, I can't.\n\n373\n00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:49.265\nPeople will not like you too much.\n&gt;&gt; It's like a bad set of 80s glasses or\n\n374\n00:19:49.265 --> 00:19:54.520\nsomething, with the louvers or something?\n&gt;&gt; With the little slats in it?\n\n375\n00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.250\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; Vonne I do have to ask,\n\n376\n00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:57.960\nwhy are those even available?\n\n377\n00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.700\nLike I've never seen anything using those,\nthat looks nice, or\n\n378\n00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:06.250\nis even readable, because like\npolarization schemes like that,\n\n379\n00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:11.335\nmake your eyes do weird stuff.\n&gt;&gt; I cannot give you a good answer.\n\n380\n00:20:11.335 --> 00:20:14.570\n[LAUGH] Besides just cuz you can,\n\n381\n00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:17.895\ndoesn't mean you should.\n&gt;&gt; No truer words spoken.\n\n382\n00:20:17.895 --> 00:20:19.922\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And the patterns are one thing,\n\n383\n00:20:19.922 --> 00:20:22.530\nin the PC world,\nyou can actually do gradients.\n\n384\n00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:27.310\nGradients are a little less jarring,\ngive maybe a subtle change in color.\n\n385\n00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:28.890\nGuess what?\nWe can't do gradients here,\n\n386\n00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:31.990\nso I would just pick one solid color.\n\n387\n00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:33.720\nMaybe not bright, fuchsia pink,\n\n388\n00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.150\nunless you're doing stuff for\nchildren and fun stuff.\n\n389\n00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:41.850\nAnd hey, you know what, there's plenty\nof companies with bright text pink,\n\n390\n00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:44.100\nbright pink in their logos.\n\n391\n00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.862\nAnd so I like going to their stuff\nthat they're sponsoring because\n\n392\n00:20:46.862 --> 00:20:47.806\neverything's pink.\n\n393\n00:20:47.806 --> 00:20:48.814\nIt's quite fun.\n\n394\n00:20:48.814 --> 00:20:54.310\nAll righty, so we have the shading colors,\nlet's move on to the borders.\n\n395\n00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:57.770\nThis one can get people,\nI'm just gonna tell you right now, okay?\n\n396\n00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:03.870\nIt seems very simple but\nI've watched people struggle with this.\n\n397\n00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:09.000\nLet's first clarify\nborders versus grid lines.\n\n398\n00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.460\nRight now, you see all of the lines,\n\n399\n00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:16.330\nthe separations between the rows and\nthe columns.\n\n400\n00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:18.750\nThis is because there\nare grid lines being shown.\n\n401\n00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:22.750\nWe've seen this in some of the other\nepisodes where we could turn the grid\n\n402\n00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:25.350\nlines off and\nnow it's just all white, okay?\n\n403\n00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:28.960\nThe other thing is if you go to print\nthis, and I'm just did a Cmd+P for\n\n404\n00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.740\nPrint Preview, this will show you.\n\n405\n00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:34.480\nIt's kind of hard to see in this preview,\nbut your grid lines don't print, okay?\n\n406\n00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.940\nI get this question all the time, they're\nlike, I need to print out the boxes.\n\n407\n00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.580\nI'm like, what do you mean?\n\n408\n00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.700\nLike the lines,\nthe lines between the cells,\n\n409\n00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.740\nI'm like, you want to apply borders.\n\n410\n00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:46.320\nLike yeah, like okay.\n\n411\n00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.310\nSo then like for example here.\n\n412\n00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:49.000\nI know the text is,\n\n413\n00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.260\nyou probably can't read it but right\nnow just kinda look for the outlines.\n\n414\n00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:56.630\nSo I'd say,\nwell why don't you just go ahead and\n\n415\n00:21:56.630 --> 00:22:00.900\nselect your cells and\njust apply your borders.\n\n416\n00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:04.730\nSo I say just go over to the little\nbutton next to the paint bucket.\n\n417\n00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:06.570\nClick the button that says all borders,\nand\n\n418\n00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:08.420\nthey're like my gosh that's\nexactly what I wanted.\n\n419\n00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:12.180\nBecause they want those\ngrid lines to be printed.\n\n420\n00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:17.130\nYou can print gridlines,\njust really quickly let me show you.\n\n421\n00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:21.440\nIf I come back over to sales,\nlet me zoom out a little bit.\n\n422\n00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:25.450\nI can come over here to,\nis it Page Layout?\n\n423\n00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:31.490\nYes, on Page Layout up at the top,\nthere is a Print of your grid lines.\n\n424\n00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:34.850\nAnd then if I print this,\nthe only thing that's a little,\n\n425\n00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:37.970\nit's different is,\nthis is not the best representation.\n\n426\n00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:43.120\nBut do you see it's gonna print all\nthe gridlines where data exist.\n\n427\n00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:49.510\nSo all of the in betweens, between\nthe data, all of that is gonna print.\n\n428\n00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:51.820\nSo it's a little less control, but\n\n429\n00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:55.760\nif all your data is contiguous,\nthen that might be one of your options.\n\n430\n00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:01.759\nSo just in case, yet, that is a valid\noption for printing the boxes.\n\n431\n00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.080\nBut borders and\ngridlines are two different things.\n\n432\n00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:10.250\nSo if I wanted to apply my borders,\nyou just saw me do it, right?\n\n433\n00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:14.920\nI could go ahead and take them all and\napply all sorts of different borders.\n\n434\n00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.490\nNow, look at the different options here.\n\n435\n00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:20.570\nYou have top border,\nright border, top and bottom,\n\n436\n00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:24.430\na thick bottom border,\nall of that kind of stuff.\n\n437\n00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:28.460\nIf you have like a single line of cells,\nand\n\n438\n00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.740\nI’m just switching back and\nforth from worksheets.\n\n439\n00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:34.960\nLike for example,\nif I had here, daily totals.\n\n440\n00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.790\nOkay, let's zoom in a little bit.\n\n441\n00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:38.200\nAnd I have all selected and\n\n442\n00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:42.400\nI choose a thick bottom border and\nthen I click off of it.\n\n443\n00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:46.820\nNotice, it's put a thick bottom border\nacross all of your selected cells.\n\n444\n00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:53.140\nBut if I select multiple rows, if you want\nto say, or ranges and then I choose this.\n\n445\n00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:57.664\nIt does not put a thick bottom\nborder on the bottom of every rows\n\n446\n00:23:57.664 --> 00:24:01.067\nHere's the selection, here's the border.\n\n447\n00:24:01.067 --> 00:24:04.890\nThat's what everybody's like, no,\nbut I want them on every single one.\n\n448\n00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:08.350\nI'm like, no, you gotta go\na different place, keep that in mind,\n\n449\n00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:10.070\nI will show you where\nit is in just a second.\n\n450\n00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:14.890\nSo it's all based on what you have\nselected and then what are you applying.\n\n451\n00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:21.040\nAll the way outside, all of the borders,\nyou know, the different types of borders.\n\n452\n00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:26.363\nSo these are for each selection, but\nyou have a couple other options down here.\n\n453\n00:24:26.363 --> 00:24:30.549\nNotice you have Draw, the Grid, the Erase\nand the Line Color and Line Style and\n\n454\n00:24:30.549 --> 00:24:32.210\nthen the More Borders option.\n\n455\n00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:36.910\nThis is another thing that throws people\noff too, do you see there's a Line Color.\n\n456\n00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:40.434\nSo let's go back and do this again,\nI'm going to, I just did an undo.\n\n457\n00:24:40.434 --> 00:24:47.668\nI'm gonna select these, and\nI want to apply the Outside Border.\n\n458\n00:24:47.668 --> 00:24:50.150\nSo I mean the outside of all my sections,\nand you're like, but you know what?\n\n459\n00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:51.730\nI also want to make that\na different color, right?\n\n460\n00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:53.140\nI don't want it to just be black.\n\n461\n00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:57.440\nSo they come over here to Line Color,\nand they're like I want to be green, and\n\n462\n00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.620\nthen you go that's not green.\n\n463\n00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:01.990\nAnd then you start going whoa, wait, what?\n\n464\n00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:05.510\nWhat's going,\nlook at my mouse cursor icon.\n\n465\n00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:10.249\nIt's not a cell selector anymore, because\nwhat you just did is you just switched\n\n466\n00:25:10.249 --> 00:25:14.930\nyourself into Draw Border mode, and\nthat's where again people are like wait.\n\n467\n00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:18.225\nCuz logical, apply the border,\nchange the color, right?\n\n468\n00:25:18.225 --> 00:25:21.061\nIt's not how it works, and you're\nover there, you've done this before,\n\n469\n00:25:21.061 --> 00:25:21.980\nhaven't you?\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n470\n00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:25.510\nI could see me throwing my hands up and\ngoing, I need some help on this,\n\n471\n00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:29.750\nbecause it's not intuitive, because with\nText Color, Fill Color, all of those\n\n472\n00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:32.650\nI select and then I modify the color.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n473\n00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:33.888\n&gt;&gt; But for borders it puts\n\n474\n00:25:33.888 --> 00:25:38.581\nyou into Draw mode, which I'm gonna be\nhonest with you, I've never even scrolled,\n\n475\n00:25:38.581 --> 00:25:40.420\nI haven't looked at that at all.\n\n476\n00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:41.850\nI was like, you can draw a border?\n\n477\n00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:42.960\nI didn't know that.\n\n478\n00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:46.188\nBut if I was trying to change the line\ncolor and I accidentally ended up in that\n\n479\n00:25:46.188 --> 00:25:48.228\nmode, that would be really confusing.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n480\n00:25:48.228 --> 00:25:50.350\n&gt;&gt; And it's odd that they don't have some\n\n481\n00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:55.046\nsemi-intuitive that supplied the remaining\nI guess styles in this case, of like font\n\n482\n00:25:55.046 --> 00:25:57.550\ncolor and background color and stuff.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n483\n00:25:57.550 --> 00:26:03.260\nthat's where borders trips people up,\nit's not intuitive and it's not logical,\n\n484\n00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:08.190\nthe way we think of how to select, draw,\nyou know, apply, change colors, no.\n\n485\n00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:09.803\nYou have to think of\nit in a different way.\n\n486\n00:26:09.803 --> 00:26:13.159\nAnd the other thing is that whole turn\nthe lights on, turn the lights off,\n\n487\n00:26:13.159 --> 00:26:15.210\nremember with the vertical thing?\n\n488\n00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:19.750\nThat's the same thing here, as soon as\nyou go to Line Color or Line Style,\n\n489\n00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:26.780\nregardless if you have a selection or not,\nyou just turned on the Draw Border option.\n\n490\n00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:30.450\nAs long as you know that it does,\nyou can turn it off.\n\n491\n00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:34.688\nCuz, the Draw Borders, I'm just gonna\ncome down here to like a blank area,\n\n492\n00:26:34.688 --> 00:26:38.410\nthe Draw Borders can be kinda fun,\nin the sense that I can turn on.\n\n493\n00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:43.423\nHere, I'm going to make this red, now\nnotice, look, I know that this changed.\n\n494\n00:26:43.423 --> 00:26:46.970\nSo soon as I change the color I'm\nalso gonna go with a thicker style.\n\n495\n00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:53.140\nNow what I can do is I can just like\nkinda click, hold, and drag, and\n\n496\n00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:57.370\nI can apply the borders\nwhere I want them to go.\n\n497\n00:26:57.370 --> 00:26:59.750\nSo you're drawing a border.\n\n498\n00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:03.710\nYou're kinda like [NOISE], I know, me too.\n\n499\n00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:07.420\nI will tell you I don't do this a lot,\nbut I know what it does, so\n\n500\n00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:09.110\nevery once in a while I will.\n\n501\n00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:13.150\nBecause if I wanted to start getting a\nlittle fancy and then come over here, and\n\n502\n00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:15.370\nnow let's go ahead and change the color.\n\n503\n00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:17.688\nAnd now let's go ahead and\nmake some green borders, and\n\n504\n00:27:17.688 --> 00:27:19.773\nnow I feel like I'm just drawing for\nfun, right?\n\n505\n00:27:19.773 --> 00:27:24.539\n[LAUGH] But notice I also can do\na diagonal and I can do all of this, so\n\n506\n00:27:24.539 --> 00:27:26.225\ntake it for what it is.\n\n507\n00:27:26.225 --> 00:27:30.100\nSo see whether or not you want to do it,\nand decide from there.\n\n508\n00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:34.002\nBut do know that now my Draw Border is on,\nto turn it off,\n\n509\n00:27:34.002 --> 00:27:36.089\nyou got to turn it off, okay?\n\n510\n00:27:36.089 --> 00:27:40.784\nThe same way, let me just scroll down\na little bit more, the Draw Border Grid,\n\n511\n00:27:40.784 --> 00:27:42.789\nwhat do you think it's gonna do?\n\n512\n00:27:42.789 --> 00:27:44.430\nIt's gonna draw a grid, okay.\n\n513\n00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:48.760\n[LAUGH] So it's basically\ndoing the apply all borders,\n\n514\n00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:54.070\njust with a pen, and you can just\nkinda put it wherever you want.\n\n515\n00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:57.595\nYou know we were talking about slapping\ncoats of paint on these things, right?\n\n516\n00:27:57.595 --> 00:27:58.850\n[LAUGH] So I can take that,\n\n517\n00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:01.720\nthe same things happens if\nyou go to the Erase Border.\n\n518\n00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:05.270\nIt's like, you turn it on,\nyou get the little eraser, and\n\n519\n00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:09.630\nthen I can erase just a few here,\nand erase there, and just these.\n\n520\n00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:12.220\nLet me click, hold, and\ndrag across all of them.\n\n521\n00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:17.930\nSo it's a little bit more freehand if\nyou wanna say with the Draw Borders,\n\n522\n00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:19.590\nBorder Grid, and the Erase.\n\n523\n00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:25.390\nAnd you gotta know to turn them off,\nso keep that in mind.\n\n524\n00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:30.172\nNow the other thing of being able to have\na little bit more control over applying\n\n525\n00:28:30.172 --> 00:28:31.560\nyour borders, okay?\n\n526\n00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.930\nLet me show you,\nI'm gonna just select these cells here.\n\n527\n00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:39.258\nAnd if you choose all these\nbuttons that's one thing, but\n\n528\n00:28:39.258 --> 00:28:44.050\ngoing down to the bottom, where it says,\nI gotta scroll this way, More Borders.\n\n529\n00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:50.250\nLook at where you are at,\nyou are in the Format Cells dialogue box.\n\n530\n00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:53.640\nThis is another one that\nis not intuitive and\n\n531\n00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:56.860\nits backwards thinking,\nat least in my book, okay?\n\n532\n00:28:56.860 --> 00:29:02.425\nSo I have over here, you see that we've\ngot, how do you want it to apply?\n\n533\n00:29:02.425 --> 00:29:06.210\nTop, middle, bottom,\ndiagonal, all these buttons.\n\n534\n00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:07.150\nIf I choose outside,\n\n535\n00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:10.490\nit's all the outsides,\nif I click insides, its all the insides.\n\n536\n00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:15.140\nI can turn off the outsides, well actually\nnow it's like I only want the insides and\n\n537\n00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:16.410\nnot the outsides.\n\n538\n00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:19.940\nThen you see you can turn\nthese buttons on and off and\n\n539\n00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:23.770\nit's going to apply to\nwhat you want them to be.\n\n540\n00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:25.690\nThat's a little too much so\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n541\n00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:29.225\nturn all of these, you know what,\nI'm just gonna go back and do this again.\n\n542\n00:29:29.225 --> 00:29:32.220\n[LAUGH] Here's all my borders but\nlike, you applied them, right?\n\n543\n00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:36.636\nBut then I'm like, okay so\nnow I want a thicker border and\n\n544\n00:29:36.636 --> 00:29:38.576\nI want them to be, pink.\n\n545\n00:29:38.576 --> 00:29:43.683\nWhat color is those Justin right there?\n&gt;&gt; Here we again, we've set up how we\n\n546\n00:29:43.683 --> 00:29:48.700\nwant it to look, and we're trying to\nmodify certain visual aspects of it.\n\n547\n00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:51.700\nBut I'm guessing you have to pick these\nfirst before you actually set them up.\n\n548\n00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:55.007\n&gt;&gt; Yes, this still gets me to this day,\n\n549\n00:29:55.007 --> 00:29:57.370\nand I know how this works.\n\n550\n00:29:57.370 --> 00:30:02.810\nNow if you thought enough ahead, yes pick\nthe style, pick the color, then apply.\n\n551\n00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:06.632\nBut you're like well I did it backwards,\nno just click it again, and so\n\n552\n00:30:06.632 --> 00:30:09.670\nyou can see that I can come into here and\napply them.\n\n553\n00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:13.710\nNow this is the other one, if I choose\nNone, let me just clear it, watch this.\n\n554\n00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:18.161\nIf I click this one, in between,\njust the in between parts, and I click OK,\n\n555\n00:30:18.161 --> 00:30:22.630\nremember that whole like I wanted a thick\nbottom border between all of them?\n\n556\n00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:28.270\nThat's how you do it, you have to go\ninto the Format Cells dialog box,\n\n557\n00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:34.675\nand know where those lines are, and how\nI want to apply those different pieces,\n\n558\n00:30:34.675 --> 00:30:38.434\nand so\nit just takes a while to get used to this.\n\n559\n00:30:38.434 --> 00:30:46.140\nSo style, color, come on [LAUGH],\nokay, I'll get you.\n\n560\n00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:48.600\nAnd then do I want diagonals?\n\n561\n00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:49.880\nDo I want just the middle?\n\n562\n00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:51.880\nSo then that's what I get here,\n\n563\n00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:54.540\nI don't know if I ever really\nwanna apply borders like this.\n\n564\n00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:58.210\nBut you get the idea of having to\nget into there, and just knowing\n\n565\n00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:02.420\nthat in my mind it's backwards\nlogic in where you want to apply.\n\n566\n00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:07.200\nSo you gotta play around with it, if you\nwanna use the Draw Borders button to get\n\n567\n00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.380\nthem, like, lines in between or\nthe borders in between, go for it.\n\n568\n00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:14.180\nIf you wanna go into the Format dialogue\nbox and play around with that little box\n\n569\n00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:19.480\ndown there of turning borders on and\noff, go for it, it's totally fine.\n\n570\n00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:23.720\nBut I do know this really\nmesses people up lot.\n\n571\n00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:28.260\nThere's one last thing I know, I know we\npretty much are out of time right now, but\n\n572\n00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:33.360\nthis just happened today, so\nI wanted to show you something.\n\n573\n00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:39.510\nI had somebody that had text,\nlet's just do this, inside here, okay?\n\n574\n00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:41.716\nSo they have another column right here, so\n\n575\n00:31:41.716 --> 00:31:44.758\nnotice they we have like\nthe overflow of the text, right?\n\n576\n00:31:44.758 --> 00:31:49.840\nSo I'm gonna make this even smaller and\nmaybe make this text a little bit bigger.\n\n577\n00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:53.400\nAnd she had,\nshe's like I can't see the lines.\n\n578\n00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:58.560\nWatch, she came into here and\nher fill was white.\n\n579\n00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:01.650\nAnd she's like, I can't see the lines,\nI can't see the borders.\n\n580\n00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:06.680\nI'm like, wait, there's no borders,\nit's because the cells were white.\n\n581\n00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:09.390\nThey weren't clear, they were white.\n\n582\n00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:13.870\nSo it's a weird thing, and I'm like,\nwait, hold on, that's what it was.\n\n583\n00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:17.900\nShe goes, that's exactly what it is,\nso be careful about these things.\n\n584\n00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:18.510\nWhy isn't that clear?\n\n585\n00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:22.000\nIt's kind of like null does not\nequal zero, that type of thing.\n\n586\n00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.370\nSo it's a little weird, but I know we're\nrunning out of time and everything.\n\n587\n00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:31.396\nI have two other things that we do need to\ntalk about which is copying formats and\n\n588\n00:32:31.396 --> 00:32:32.260\nclear formats.\n\n589\n00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:35.276\nBut you know what, I do hit those\nup in some other episodes and\n\n590\n00:32:35.276 --> 00:32:38.059\nwe will talk about copying\nformats in the next episode,\n\n591\n00:32:38.059 --> 00:32:41.985\nbecause what you can do here with all of\nyour formats, you can apply in styles.\n\n592\n00:32:41.985 --> 00:32:42.786\nI love me some styles,\n\n593\n00:32:42.786 --> 00:32:46.240\nso I'll show you how to use them in Excel.\n&gt;&gt; Well Vonne, you've definitely caught my\n\n594\n00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:49.690\nattention because after getting\nstuck in Draw Border mode,\n\n595\n00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:51.700\nI have an absolute mess on my screen.\n\n596\n00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:55.030\nSo I just kinda want to clear things out.\n\n597\n00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:59.640\nWell I tried and I failed horribly, so\nluckily we're coming back talk about that,\n\n598\n00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:00.950\nso definitely stay tuned.\n\n599\n00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:02.570\nBut for now we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n600\n00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:05.360\nSo signing off for OfficeProTV I've\nbeen your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n601\n00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.070\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n602\n00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:08.092\n&gt;&gt; And we'ill see you next time.\n\n603\n00:33:08.092 --> 00:33:13.409\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.160\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and\n\n4\n00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.160\nwe're continuing on with our Excel\n2016 essentials for Mac show.\n\n5\n00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.520\nAnd well we're gonna be\nlooking at styles and themes.\n\n6\n00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.660\nThese are the times that\nthings that excite me and\n\n7\n00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.590\nfrighten me all at the same time.\n\n8\n00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.220\nLuckily, we have someone in\nthe studio who is scared of nothing.\n\n9\n00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.160\nAnd that's the one and\nthe only Ms.Yvonne Smith.\n\n10\n00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.090\nHow are you doing today, Yvonne?\n\n11\n00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.529\n&gt;&gt; I am scared of lizards.\n\n12\n00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:37.426\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well yeah,\n\n13\n00:00:37.426 --> 00:00:39.363\nare we talking like monitor lizards or\n\n14\n00:00:39.363 --> 00:00:41.855\nwe're talking like little\nbit baby green nose?\n\n15\n00:00:41.855 --> 00:00:43.910\n&gt;&gt; No, the little, tiny ones-\n&gt;&gt; Come on, Vonne!\n\n16\n00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.890\n&gt;&gt; And it's so funny, because they get in\nthe house, in the screen, and I can't,\n\n17\n00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.475\nI'm like, I can't touch them,\nI can't, just get them!\n\n18\n00:00:50.475 --> 00:00:52.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know what it is.\n\n19\n00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.080\nAnd I used to play with them\nwhen I was kid, I don't know.\n\n20\n00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.700\n&gt;&gt; You just grab them and\nyou go, what you doing, and\n\n21\n00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.440\nyou take them-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n22\n00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.120\nnow it's like they freak me out [LAUGH].\n\n23\n00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.300\n&gt;&gt; Well, I definitely oversold that\nyou're not afraid of anything,\n\n24\n00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.650\nbut\n&gt;&gt; Luckily,\n\n25\n00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.440\nyou do know your styles and themes.\n\n26\n00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.100\nIt is something you're\ngoing to geek out on.\n\n27\n00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.376\nI don't want to steal your thunder so,\nI guess I'll just turn it over to you and\n\n28\n00:01:10.376 --> 00:01:11.131\nlet you geek out.\n\n29\n00:01:11.131 --> 00:01:15.796\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You've been on a couple of my\nepisodes when I talk about this stuff\n\n30\n00:01:15.796 --> 00:01:18.840\nbecause yeah,I love styles and themes.\n\n31\n00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.530\nYou have a theme for a party and we have\nall the plates and the cups that match.\n\n32\n00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.220\nYou talk about this in Word, and I feel\nlike you've talked about this before.\n\n33\n00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.320\nYeah, I have.\n\n34\n00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.220\nIt's all part of all of\nthe Office suite products.\n\n35\n00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.950\nSo it's kind of something\nthat's built into it.\n\n36\n00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.200\nBut before we get into styles and\nthemes, while this is not a part two,\n\n37\n00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.480\nit kind of is, in the sense of like we're\ntalking about formatting a worksheet.\n\n38\n00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.034\nAnd the two things that I did not cover in\nthe last episode were the copy formats and\n\n39\n00:01:49.034 --> 00:01:50.431\nthe clear formats.\n\n40\n00:01:50.431 --> 00:01:56.090\nI wanna start there, and\nit kinda ties in to the styles, okay?\n\n41\n00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.560\nSo we're going to start there.\n\n42\n00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.760\nSo let's take a look at my screen.\n\n43\n00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.640\nAnd if you saw the last episode,\nthis looks exactly like where we left off.\n\n44\n00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.490\nBecause you know what?\n\n45\n00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.690\nWe did it.\n\n46\n00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.270\nAnd the clear, that's something I\nwanted to go over for a second.\n\n47\n00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.463\nSo on this particular worksheet,\nI didn't do any formatting out here.\n\n48\n00:02:12.463 --> 00:02:14.939\nNone, so if I took this and\nsaid, you know what?\n\n49\n00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:16.220\nI don't need this any more.\n\n50\n00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.830\nAnd I just hit the delete can on\nmy keyboard and deletes the text.\n\n51\n00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.570\nWe talked about that and inserting data.\n\n52\n00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.080\nSo take this out, delete it.\n\n53\n00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.950\nThat's all I need to do.\n\n54\n00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.850\nI could take you know I could take these\nother rows out here and I can delete this.\n\n55\n00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.510\nBecause I just need to move this up.\n\n56\n00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.090\nOkay that's where I just need to just\noops I forgot these two let's just\n\n57\n00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.680\nmove these up.\n\n58\n00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.730\nAll right, you know what?\n\n59\n00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.810\nJust stop, Vonne, we're good.\n\n60\n00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.260\nYou've proved the point\nof using the Delete key.\n\n61\n00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.790\nLet's come over here, okay?\n\n62\n00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.324\nSo if I take and select these cells,\nand then I hit the Delete key, well,\n\n63\n00:02:46.324 --> 00:02:52.710\nthe Delete key only deletes the contents.\n\n64\n00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.920\nAll of your formatting states.\n\n65\n00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.180\nThis includes number formats,\nfont formats, everything.\n\n66\n00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.930\nAnd this can get you tripped up cuz I\ndon't know if you all have ever done it\n\n67\n00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.470\nwhere you might have done this\non something, you go back.\n\n68\n00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.270\nAnd a couple months later you come back\nand like why am I typing in purple?\n\n69\n00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.340\nOr why did that change\nthe number that I just typed in?\n\n70\n00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.050\nCuz it's remembering the format.\n\n71\n00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.470\nIf you didn't have the fill columns and\nborders,\n\n72\n00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.980\nyou might not ever even notice that.\n\n73\n00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.270\nOr you have noticed it and like,\nwhy won't it get all the stuff gone?\n\n74\n00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.580\nSo it's just two different things.\n\n75\n00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.670\nDelete or yeah the Delete or\nthe Backspace key I guess.\n\n76\n00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.670\nWe don't really have\nBackspace keys on Macs.\n\n77\n00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.560\nBut that's what's gonna happen.\n\n78\n00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.940\nOn the Home Tab,\n\n79\n00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.790\nover here on the little eraser button over\non the right hand side, there's a clear.\n\n80\n00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.780\nAnd you might actually see\nthe word clear next to it.\n\n81\n00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:49.580\nNotice I have a clear contents, that's\nwhat the Delete key does on the keyboard.\n\n82\n00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.230\nBut I also have two other options,\nI have Clear Formats.\n\n83\n00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.890\nIf I do Clear Formats, that's gonna\ntake in removal of formats but\n\n84\n00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.150\nkeep all the content.\n\n85\n00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.150\nOkay, that's kinda cool.\n\n86\n00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.300\nOr if it's like, I want,\nthis all would be gone.\n\n87\n00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.230\nI do not want any formats and\nI do not want any content, clear all.\n\n88\n00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.300\nThat is going to clear all.\n\n89\n00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.540\nSo, now I don't have any of my alignments,\n\n90\n00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.400\nI don't have any font\ncolors; everything goes back.\n\n91\n00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.610\nI don't have any number formats.\n\n92\n00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.030\nEverything goes back to being normal.\n\n93\n00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.690\nSo that's something that\nkinda throws people off.\n\n94\n00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.600\nClearing it everything,\neverything is really, really gone, okay?\n\n95\n00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.570\nSo keep that in mind,\nDelete does not really delete.\n\n96\n00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.430\nThe other one we need to talk\nabout is copying formats.\n\n97\n00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.940\nYou know what?\n\n98\n00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.760\nLet's for fun,let's just come\nover here and take Jack.\n\n99\n00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.980\nWe're gonna move Jack over here.\n\n100\n00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.600\nNo, we're gonna take Pumpkin.\n\n101\n00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.280\nGood old Pumpkin.\n\n102\n00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.760\nHe was our Gen1 cat.\n\n103\n00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.400\nPumpkin and Puma were Gen1s.\n\n104\n00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.500\nFuego and Bishop, they're Gen2s.\n\n105\n00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.550\nSo we have Pumpkin and\nI want to make this maybe a bigger font.\n\n106\n00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.400\nLet's make it, you know what?\n\n107\n00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.870\nWhat color should we make Pumpkin?\n\n108\n00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.760\n&gt;&gt; Let's go with orange.\n\n109\n00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.210\n&gt;&gt; Yep, let's do that.\n\n110\n00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.990\nLet's make him bold and\nwe'll make him Comic sans.\n\n111\n00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.030\nHe was kind of a fun little cat.\n\n112\n00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.190\nLots of different formattings, right?\n\n113\n00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.610\nI want to do the same type\nof formattings to Jack and\n\n114\n00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.060\nto Puma and to Marketing and\nDeveloper and everything.\n\n115\n00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.940\nSo, how do I do that?\n\n116\n00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.360\nCopy and\npaste is going to copy the content right?\n\n117\n00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.890\nBut the format painter, we did talk\nabout slapping a coat of paint on it.\n\n118\n00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.350\nThe format painter is\nsomething's that kinda of cool.\n\n119\n00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.650\nIt copies formatting from one location and\napplies it to another.\n\n120\n00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.230\nNeat, but how does it work?\n\n121\n00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.010\nThis is where I always\nhave to tell people.\n\n122\n00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.700\nJust like if you're painting a house or\n\n123\n00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.230\npainting the walls which I\ndid a lot of last weekend.\n\n124\n00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.180\nYou have to have a can of paint, right?\n\n125\n00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.260\nYou have a brush.\n\n126\n00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.059\nYou dip the paintbrush into the paint.\n\n127\n00:05:56.059 --> 00:05:57.104\nPut the paint on the brush.\n\n128\n00:05:57.104 --> 00:05:58.078\nAnd you come over here.\n\n129\n00:05:58.078 --> 00:05:59.779\nI should come over this way so\nI [LAUGH] with the microphone.\n\n130\n00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:02.012\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I paint the walls, right?\n\n131\n00:06:02.012 --> 00:06:03.140\nSo that's what you do.\n\n132\n00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.320\nIt's the same procedure when\nyou're copying formats.\n\n133\n00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.210\nThis is my can of paint.\n\n134\n00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.940\nI have to make sure I have\nthe paint can selected,\n\n135\n00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.170\nmeaning the cell that I want\nthe format to be copied from, selected.\n\n136\n00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:21.900\nClick the brush, dip the paintbrush\ninto the paint with my dotted lines,\n\n137\n00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.600\nand you even have an icon\nthat looks like a paintbrush.\n\n138\n00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.990\nAnd then I say, put it on the wall.\n\n139\n00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.060\nClick on Puma, there you go.\n\n140\n00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.140\nYou just copied your formatting.\n\n141\n00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:32.450\nThe only thing is like,\n\n142\n00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:36.550\nwell now I want to go with Jack and\nwait, it's a one time thing.\n\n143\n00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.170\nIt's kinda like you got to go back and\ndip your paintbrush into the paint and\n\n144\n00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.060\nthen put some more on there.\n\n145\n00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.210\nYeah, or you know I know they sell\nthose fancy spray guns, right?\n\n146\n00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.080\nI know it's like these,\ngoes all over the place.\n\n147\n00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.170\nHave you ever used one of those?\n\n148\n00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.630\n&gt;&gt; I have, I actually worked in\nthe paint industry for like six years.\n\n149\n00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:55.440\nSo, I got to play with a bunch of toys\nthat take paint out of a bucket, and\n\n150\n00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.710\nput it on the wall.\n\n151\n00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.980\nAnd I will tell you, if you're\nusing a four inch wall brush Vonne,\n\n152\n00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.580\nI'm going to have to introduce\nyou to some new tools.\n\n153\n00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.600\nWhich I expect you're getting ready\nto introduce us to an additional\n\n154\n00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.490\ntool, as well.\n\n155\n00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.268\n&gt;&gt; And that's why I say those paint guns,\nyou just pull the trigger,\n\n156\n00:07:09.268 --> 00:07:10.170\nit goes everywhere.\n\n157\n00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.976\nBut hey, if you keep it on,\nthen it's going to go everywhere, so\n\n158\n00:07:12.976 --> 00:07:14.830\nyou've got to be a little careful.\n\n159\n00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.560\nWhen you go back to our paint can,\n\n160\n00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.120\nsorry our formatted cell that I\nwant to copy the formats from.\n\n161\n00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:25.550\nIf you double click on the format painter,\nit's like you got the gun and it's on.\n\n162\n00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.810\nSo if it's click, click.\n\n163\n00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:29.110\nClick hold drag.\n\n164\n00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:30.050\nClick hold drag.\n\n165\n00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:31.530\nAnd then, okay, I'm done.\n\n166\n00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:32.500\nWhoops, no.\n\n167\n00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.490\nWe're getting out of control aren't we?\n\n168\n00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:35.480\nStop.\n\n169\n00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:35.990\nRight.\n\n170\n00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.910\nLet go.\n\n171\n00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:38.740\nYou got to turn it off, okay.\n\n172\n00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.870\nSo then you just come back up to\nthe format panel, you click it once and\n\n173\n00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.470\nthen it turns it off.\n\n174\n00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:49.340\nSo good stuff, neat, and then it goes\nahead and copies your formatting.\n\n175\n00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:49.888\nReally cool.\n\n176\n00:07:49.888 --> 00:07:53.320\nFormat painters in all of the products,\nI think, or\n\n177\n00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:57.930\nat least the major ones, Word,\nExcel and PowerPoint Maybe Outlook?\n\n178\n00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:00.706\nI can't remember, I think so, maybe?\n\n179\n00:08:00.706 --> 00:08:02.584\n&gt;&gt; You're asking the, I don't.\n\n180\n00:08:02.584 --> 00:08:04.133\nOutlook is now my bag, Vonne.\n\n181\n00:08:04.133 --> 00:08:05.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I've been meaning to get better at it.\n\n182\n00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:10.658\nI have used this in Excel because there's\na lot of times I have Excel cells that\n\n183\n00:08:10.658 --> 00:08:13.300\nI'm like, I need these to be reproduced.\n\n184\n00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:14.890\nAnd I've used it a couple\nof times in Word.\n\n185\n00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:18.736\nI haven't used it in PowerPoint, and\nI haven't it used in Outlook either.\n\n186\n00:08:18.736 --> 00:08:19.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n187\n00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:21.550\nit makes sense because\nall of those things,\n\n188\n00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:25.490\nyou may have particular formats that\nyou wanna carry over to various parts.\n\n189\n00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:28.110\nSo I would suspect that if\nit's not completely there,\n\n190\n00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:29.445\nthere's some semblance of it there.\n\n191\n00:08:29.445 --> 00:08:31.240\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, now here's the kicker.\n\n192\n00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.762\nThis is great, right, and\nyou've got it all over the place.\n\n193\n00:08:33.762 --> 00:08:38.373\nWhat if someone comes along and\nsays, you know what,\n\n194\n00:08:38.373 --> 00:08:42.984\nall of this comic sans is orange,\nchange all of that to\n\n195\n00:08:42.984 --> 00:08:47.610\nright aligned pink and arial So\nwhat are you gonna do?\n\n196\n00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.350\nYou're gonna have to go back and\nchange them all.\n\n197\n00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:54.060\nWell if you had have made that a style,\n\n198\n00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.950\nall you had to do was change\nit in the style definition and\n\n199\n00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:59.440\nthen poof it would just\nmagically go ahead and populate.\n\n200\n00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:01.800\nI love styles.\n\n201\n00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:08.600\nI live by styles because I use them day\nin and day out of everything that I do.\n\n202\n00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.116\nSeriously, I'm not making that up.\n\n203\n00:09:10.116 --> 00:09:14.762\nSo [LAUGH] that you have styles in Excel,\nthey're slightly different\n\n204\n00:09:14.762 --> 00:09:18.940\nthan styles in Word in the sense\nof just the implementation.\n\n205\n00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:24.927\nIt's 90% the same, but\njust a tiny bit, a little different.\n\n206\n00:09:24.927 --> 00:09:27.780\n[LAUGH] Let me just show you.\n\n207\n00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.738\nOkay, so when I have styles,\nlet's come over here.\n\n208\n00:09:30.738 --> 00:09:33.890\nYou know what,\nI actually have another worksheet, or\n\n209\n00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:37.690\nworkbook, that we're going to start that.\n\n210\n00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:38.660\nWhat do you think?\n\n211\n00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:40.192\nWhat file do you think we're gonna use?\n\n212\n00:09:40.192 --> 00:09:43.410\n&gt;&gt; I am going to go with styles and\nthemes.\n\n213\n00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:45.720\n&gt;&gt; I'm just sitting here just look for\nif what's.\n\n214\n00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.602\nWhat file am I gonna use?\n\n215\n00:09:47.602 --> 00:09:49.790\nYeah, it's this one, okay.\n\n216\n00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:51.590\nSame stuff, just kind of copied.\n\n217\n00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:52.920\nLook at this, this looks kind of pretty,\n\n218\n00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:56.120\nright, besides the orange\nthat's kind of off to the side.\n\n219\n00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.090\nBut we are in Gainesville,\nUF, orange and blue.\n\n220\n00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:03.830\nEven though these are totally\nnot like the true UF colors,\n\n221\n00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:06.410\nthat's a pantone 172 and 268.\n\n222\n00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.137\nSorry, color dork.\n\n223\n00:10:08.137 --> 00:10:12.940\n[LAUGH] So I've got this and\nsee, it's nice and underlined.\n\n224\n00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:17.750\nIt all kinda looks, if I took out\nthis it looks the same, right,\n\n225\n00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.258\nit has a theme, it's stylized.\n\n226\n00:10:20.258 --> 00:10:23.400\nCuz these are styles, okay.\n\n227\n00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.790\nSo we're going to use\nbuilt in styles first, and\n\n228\n00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:27.670\nthen talk about making our own style.\n\n229\n00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:31.250\nAnd that's going to tie right\nback along into that whole\n\n230\n00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.400\nthing that we just did with\nthe copy format painter.\n\n231\n00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:36.880\nIt'll bring it all together, okay.\n\n232\n00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.040\nSo styles, what is a style?\n\n233\n00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.380\nA style is just a named\ngroup of formatting.\n\n234\n00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:45.060\nOkay, so it's where you can go ahead and\n\n235\n00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:48.260\ngive it a name and\nstyle all the formatting.\n\n236\n00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.660\nLike the font, the size,\nthe color, the alignment,\n\n237\n00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.520\nthe number of formatting really, can all\nbe contained within one particular name.\n\n238\n00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:59.270\nOnce you have that style, every where\nyou apply that style is linked to that.\n\n239\n00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:03.170\nYou change the style,\nit changes where it's applied.\n\n240\n00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:04.680\nVery cool.\n\n241\n00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:09.110\nIn the Home tab of your ribbon you can,\nwell sorry,\n\n242\n00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:11.380\nI was already on the ribbon,\nI just collapsed it.\n\n243\n00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.660\nThere is one over here\nwhere it says Styles.\n\n244\n00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:17.030\nNow it's gonna look a little\ndifferent on your computer.\n\n245\n00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:19.810\nI was wondering why that was,\nit's just a little bit off to the side.\n\n246\n00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:20.896\nI was like, where's my zoom?\n\n247\n00:11:20.896 --> 00:11:23.801\nOkay, interface.\n\n248\n00:11:23.801 --> 00:11:28.710\n[LAUGH] If I come over here where it\nsays Cell Styles, you might actually see\n\n249\n00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:33.820\nboxes that have the colors in it because\nof the resolution of your monitor.\n\n250\n00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:37.010\nMine's smaller, so\nthat's why mine's a drop down.\n\n251\n00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:40.250\nSo you see things like good,\nbad, and neutral.\n\n252\n00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.800\nDoes that mean my information's bad?\n\n253\n00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:47.380\nNo, it's just red text with a light\nred fill, that's all it means.\n\n254\n00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:53.360\nBut then you have these down here,\nyou have your themed cell styles.\n\n255\n00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.910\nTalked about themes in the other\nepisode because themes and\n\n256\n00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:59.250\nstyles can be connected.\n\n257\n00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:01.762\nThey are connected really.\n\n258\n00:12:01.762 --> 00:12:07.380\nSo notice that these are the ones you're\ngonna see no matter what theme you have.\n\n259\n00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:10.175\nAgain, it's not describing\nyour information,\n\n260\n00:12:10.175 --> 00:12:16.180\nit's just the physical display and\nlook of your text.\n\n261\n00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:21.030\nThat just has an underline, or\nborder, this is an orange fill,\n\n262\n00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:22.560\nthat kind of stuff.\n\n263\n00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.420\nAnd then also we have heading one,\nheading two, heading three, and four.\n\n264\n00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:27.670\nThese are things that you see in Word,\n\n265\n00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:32.140\nright, we talk extensively about\nthat in the Word episodes.\n\n266\n00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:33.460\nSo they're here as well.\n\n267\n00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.940\nNumber formats,\nwe'll get to in another episode, okay.\n\n268\n00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.130\nSo just kinda keep that in\nthe back burner right now,\n\n269\n00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:40.300\nthey're just shortcuts to what's up here.\n\n270\n00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.380\nAnd so what you can do is\nyou can select cells and\n\n271\n00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:45.170\napply this, that's what we're gonna do.\n\n272\n00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:49.290\nClick on this first cell right up here,\nwe're gonna give that a heading one.\n\n273\n00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:54.040\nAutomatic bigger, bolder,\ncolor, bottom border.\n\n274\n00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.180\nSelect these.\n\n275\n00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:58.940\nLet's go ahead and\nformat those as heading twos.\n\n276\n00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:04.290\nLook at that, so easy to go ahead and\napply nice looking formatting.\n\n277\n00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:06.420\nAnd it all matches, right.\n\n278\n00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:11.220\nSo if I want to make these a heading four,\nI love this style right here,\n\n279\n00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.650\nit's using a total.\n\n280\n00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:17.222\nSee, it makes it bold, does the double\nunderline on the bottom, single on the,\n\n281\n00:13:17.222 --> 00:13:19.800\nI keep saying underline, don't I?\n\n282\n00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:24.250\nBorder, so we have here and\nthen we could go ahead and apply it there.\n\n283\n00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:31.400\nAnd that, in just a few little clicks,\nthat looks professional doesn't it.\n\n284\n00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.230\nIt looks nice.\n\n285\n00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:35.960\n&gt;&gt; It it is definitely provided ways for\nmy eye to go.\n\n286\n00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:39.020\nOkay, these are headings,\nthis is kind of the overall heading.\n\n287\n00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:42.540\nAnd yeah, all that information was there,\nbut this is sometimes the difference\n\n288\n00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:45.700\nbetween being able to convey\ninformation appropriately.\n\n289\n00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:49.325\nSo that's a lot easier\nthen that format painter.\n\n290\n00:13:49.325 --> 00:13:51.920\nYou're starting to get me sold on this,\nVon.\n\n291\n00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:52.995\nBut I feel like you got,\n\n292\n00:13:52.995 --> 00:13:55.720\nwe're just now kind of dipping\nour toes in the water, right.\n\n293\n00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.790\n&gt;&gt; There's a little more.\n\n294\n00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:59.040\nYeah, but it's nice that this is all here.\n\n295\n00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:02.680\nI'm just gonna keep going just\nbecause I need it to finish.\n\n296\n00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.495\nIn a sense there's my heading three, and\nthen this particular is going to just,\n\n297\n00:14:06.495 --> 00:14:09.370\nI'm just going to do like an accent\nthere and maybe this one.\n\n298\n00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:12.894\nWe'll go ahead and\nformat as a heading three as maybe,\n\n299\n00:14:12.894 --> 00:14:17.260\nI don't know about heading three\ncuz I don't want the border.\n\n300\n00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.380\nSo we'll just take this and\nwe'll make it a title.\n\n301\n00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:21.010\nThat's too big.\n\n302\n00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:23.624\nSorry, you know what,\nwe're just going to go ahead and do that.\n\n303\n00:14:23.624 --> 00:14:25.413\n[LAUGH] My gosh, stop, Vonne.\n\n304\n00:14:25.413 --> 00:14:27.670\nOkay, there, perfect, beautiful.\n\n305\n00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.660\nWhew, I love that.\n\n306\n00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:33.636\nSo styles are tied by themes, and\n\n307\n00:14:33.636 --> 00:14:38.340\nthey are workbook specific, okay.\n\n308\n00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:39.630\nKeep that in mind.\n\n309\n00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:42.360\nIf I come over here,\nthis is the same exact thing, right.\n\n310\n00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.660\nSo the styles, this is a heading two,\n\n311\n00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:47.190\nI know it is because it\nsays this is a heading two.\n\n312\n00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:50.970\nOver here, this is a heading two,\nI know because I did it, okay.\n\n313\n00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:52.430\nAnd then I have some other ones down here.\n\n314\n00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:55.970\nSee, like the Bad,\nit's just the font and the fill.\n\n315\n00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:58.840\nFont and the fill for all of these, okay.\n\n316\n00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:04.580\nJust showing you that those\nare kinda like the constants, right.\n\n317\n00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:07.054\nWatch what happens when I go over and\nchange my theme.\n\n318\n00:15:07.054 --> 00:15:08.027\nWhere's the theme?\n\n319\n00:15:08.027 --> 00:15:11.930\nOkay, this is another thing that's\nacross all of your Office products.\n\n320\n00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:19.090\nA theme is your font, colors,\nand effects all pulled together.\n\n321\n00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:22.467\nSo if I come over here my Office\ntheme that we were talking about,\n\n322\n00:15:22.467 --> 00:15:25.674\nit is that calibri font,\ncuz its always in calibri, right.\n\n323\n00:15:25.674 --> 00:15:27.200\nWell that's part of the theme.\n\n324\n00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:31.520\nIt always has that orange and\nblue and green and\n\n325\n00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:35.430\nyellow blocks up there with the different\npercentages and the accent colors.\n\n326\n00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:37.270\nIt's all part of it.\n\n327\n00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.970\nBut they have the badge theme.\n\n328\n00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:42.220\nThey have the gallery.\n\n329\n00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:46.980\nSo it has a whole different\nset of default themed colors,\n\n330\n00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:51.170\ndifferent font, and\ndifferent effects that you would apply for\n\n331\n00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:53.030\nthings like graphics and\nso on and so forth.\n\n332\n00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:58.768\nSo if I choose Gallery, look, that just\nchanged everything to now shades of pink.\n\n333\n00:15:58.768 --> 00:16:01.876\nIf I come in here and\nchoose The Main Event, [SOUND].\n\n334\n00:16:01.876 --> 00:16:03.189\nOkay, that's significant.\n\n335\n00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:05.933\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know, Vonne, that that is a theme,\n\n336\n00:16:05.933 --> 00:16:07.063\nI'll give them that.\n\n337\n00:16:07.063 --> 00:16:10.826\nI'm not sure I would actually use that,\nthat's in your face,\n\n338\n00:16:10.826 --> 00:16:14.392\njust from the fall based on\nthe styles that we've applied.\n\n339\n00:16:14.392 --> 00:16:17.400\nI do have a quick question about\nthemes and the styles relationships.\n\n340\n00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.480\nIf we go into our styles where\nyou've made all those selections and\n\n341\n00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.910\nyou have those accent colors.\n\n342\n00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:26.559\nDo you always get those percentages\nof saturation based on the base\n\n343\n00:16:26.559 --> 00:16:31.300\naccent color palate that is selected for\nthe particular theme?\n\n344\n00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:31.850\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n345\n00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:33.240\nAnd that's even in here,\n\n346\n00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:37.630\nbecause now two things that have happened\nwhile you were talking, great question.\n\n347\n00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:40.931\nAnd I started moving around a lot\ncuz sales, those head styles,\n\n348\n00:16:40.931 --> 00:16:43.817\nlook at these sales styles,\nthose had the same styles.\n\n349\n00:16:43.817 --> 00:16:46.370\nSo they went across the whole workbook.\n\n350\n00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:49.640\nBut keep in mind, remember we had\nanother file open, didn't we?\n\n351\n00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.170\nRemember right here?\n\n352\n00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:52.690\nThose didn't change, right?\n\n353\n00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:55.940\nWell, wait hold on, let me go ahead and\napply a style first.\n\n354\n00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:58.930\nBut see, notice that didn't\naffect this particular workbook.\n\n355\n00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:01.210\nIt's still blue,\nit's still the office theme.\n\n356\n00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:05.600\nSo themes are workbook specific\nit's not program specific.\n\n357\n00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.180\nAnd the styles since they're\nkind of connected to the themes,\n\n358\n00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.930\nthey're going to be affected as well.\n\n359\n00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:14.010\nSo it's workbook specific in that one.\n\n360\n00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:18.213\n&gt;&gt; Okay so styles, and well the style's\nrelated to a particular theme when you\n\n361\n00:17:18.213 --> 00:17:21.967\nselect a theme and the styles that\nare applied and how those change.\n\n362\n00:17:21.967 --> 00:17:24.390\nThose are globally\naccessible within Excel.\n\n363\n00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:29.880\nWhat I mean is you can read from them but\nthey're settable, or modifiable,\n\n364\n00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:34.810\nat a workbook level and then that way\nyou can keep a separation of concern.\n\n365\n00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:35.890\nI want the styles applied for\n\n366\n00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:39.030\nthese workbooks because this has to\ndo with a certain type of business.\n\n367\n00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:42.830\nAnd these other ones have a different\ntheme, but this certain type of business.\n\n368\n00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:45.310\nDo I have all that squared away?\n\n369\n00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:47.312\n&gt;&gt; Oh,that was beautiful,\nyeah, that's exactly right.\n\n370\n00:17:47.312 --> 00:17:54.610\nYeah it is a program function, but\nworkbook level specific, very nice.\n\n371\n00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:56.580\nSo yes, so\nthis is where we have our themes.\n\n372\n00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.630\nAnd like, you had mentioned about\nthe accents, with the styles.\n\n373\n00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:03.480\nWell, that's also now here, since I\nchanged my style, look at my font color.\n\n374\n00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:08.371\nAnd notice how you always have this,\nand if you hover and stop,\n\n375\n00:18:08.371 --> 00:18:11.750\nthis is a accent 6, darker 50.\n\n376\n00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:14.460\nAccent 6, darker 25, lighter.\n\n377\n00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:19.140\nYou see like those different levels\nof tinting, if you wanna say?\n\n378\n00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:25.932\nThey're universal,\nit's the same across like font color,\n\n379\n00:18:25.932 --> 00:18:29.724\nfill color, and then also cell styles.\n\n380\n00:18:29.724 --> 00:18:30.820\nSee the 20, 40, 60, accent.\n\n381\n00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:34.307\nSo and notice it says accent 1,\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\n382\n00:18:34.307 --> 00:18:36.460\nEvery theme has a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\n383\n00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:40.944\nAnd that's where it's just kind\nof like that's the variable and\n\n384\n00:18:40.944 --> 00:18:43.480\nwe're changing the value out of it.\n\n385\n00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.160\nAnd that's what it's doing here.\n\n386\n00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.330\nSo that's what you got\ngoing on with themes.\n\n387\n00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:51.470\nAnd it's really cool to be able to\nquickly change the whole look of it.\n\n388\n00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:54.510\nNow notice I have something up here,\nVonne Pink, right?\n\n389\n00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:59.080\nWell, that's because I customized this.\n\n390\n00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:03.480\nKeep that thought for a minute,\nI'll come back around a bit.\n\n391\n00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.262\nBut, right here maybe I\nhave this particular font,\n\n392\n00:19:06.262 --> 00:19:08.168\nthis particular Madison, right?\n\n393\n00:19:08.168 --> 00:19:12.699\nI like this theme but\nthis theme is made up of these\n\n394\n00:19:12.699 --> 00:19:17.700\nparticular colors and\nthese particular fonts.\n\n395\n00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.790\nBut I could, say you know what?\n\n396\n00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:24.160\nI like these fonts but\nI really wanna have all of these colors.\n\n397\n00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:29.530\nSo you can kind of like mix and match\nthe fonts with the colors that we have.\n\n398\n00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:34.550\nLike I really want these to be arial\nblack and arial, I want those to change.\n\n399\n00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:38.220\nYou can do those kinds of things,\nthat's a better one, so\n\n400\n00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:39.800\nyou can actually see the flip.\n\n401\n00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.970\nSo, you don't have to have the colors and\nthe fonts together.\n\n402\n00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:46.470\nThey lump them all in these\nnamed themes and that's great.\n\n403\n00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:51.690\nBut notice in these colors, if I go to\nthe bottom there is lot of times in your\n\n404\n00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:56.790\nother PC office projects you can\ncustomise and make your own color themes.\n\n405\n00:19:56.790 --> 00:20:01.610\nThe only thing about this is in Mac, the\nonly place you can do it is in Powerpoint.\n\n406\n00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:06.250\nBut in PowerPoint,\nyou do them then look what came across.\n\n407\n00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:09.500\nIt goes across all of the Office products.\n\n408\n00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:10.740\nIt's a little weird, okay?\n\n409\n00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:11.610\nThat's the only thing.\n\n410\n00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:15.570\nIn PC products, you can go ahead and\ncustomize your colors in any product,\n\n411\n00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:17.645\nin Word or Excel, and that's great.\n\n412\n00:20:17.645 --> 00:20:22.240\nMac, the only place you can\ndo it is in PowerPoint but\n\n413\n00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.950\nit goes across all your applications.\n\n414\n00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:27.676\n&gt;&gt; So if I wanted to create a custom\ntheme, let's say I have a set of business\n\n415\n00:20:27.676 --> 00:20:30.987\ndocuments that I wanted to apply\na certain theme based on fonts.\n\n416\n00:20:30.987 --> 00:20:33.410\nAnd I need a custom color palette, right?\n\n417\n00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:35.270\nWith my shades and tints.\n\n418\n00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:37.930\nThen in MAC,\nI've gotta open up PowerPoint,\n\n419\n00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:40.220\ncreate my custom color palette, right?\n\n420\n00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:42.010\nMy respective collection of colors.\n\n421\n00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:45.100\nAnd I guess there's some saving going on.\n\n422\n00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:49.370\nAnd then when I close that, then they'll\nbe available in my other office products?\n\n423\n00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:51.370\nThat seems like a horrible oversight.\n\n424\n00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a little weird.\n\n425\n00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.132\nEven I had to be like why can't\nI do this in Word, right?\n\n426\n00:20:58.132 --> 00:21:00.364\nIt's just, why not, okay.\n\n427\n00:21:00.364 --> 00:21:07.530\nBut it's just the way the program goes,\nand so like if I come over here to design.\n\n428\n00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:11.195\nYet, there's my themes, and\nthen I come over here to colors,\n\n429\n00:21:11.195 --> 00:21:15.495\nright there it is in Word, but\nI can't change it directly from Word.\n\n430\n00:21:15.495 --> 00:21:17.640\nPowerPoint's the only place\nyou can go ahead and do that.\n\n431\n00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:20.750\nIt's not hard and\nit works the same way as PC.\n\n432\n00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:21.890\nYou know what?\n\n433\n00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:24.050\nBeing a Mac person,\nit's just how it works,\n\n434\n00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:28.040\nyou just gotta do it that way,\nso just to let you know.\n\n435\n00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.490\nSo now coming back over here to Excel.\n\n436\n00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:33.530\nNow I understand about themes,okay,\nthat they are connected.\n\n437\n00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:35.740\nWe now know where that's where\nour colors come from and\n\n438\n00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:38.180\nour accents and\nit is tied to those styles.\n\n439\n00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:42.600\nBut notice here okay,\nlook at the good, bad, and the ugly.\n\n440\n00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:46.340\nThe good, bad, and neutral input,\ndid they change based on my themes?\n\n441\n00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:48.320\nNo, those stay.\n\n442\n00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.580\nThose are not dependent, and\n\n443\n00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:56.140\nthat's where you see it's like in\na totally different category, right?\n\n444\n00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:00.480\nThose are not gonna change\nbased on your styles, okay.\n\n445\n00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:04.920\nThe themed ones, like your styles and\nheadings and your themed cell styles,\n\n446\n00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:09.590\nthose will change based\non the theme you choose.\n\n447\n00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:12.700\nBecause none of my fonts\never change on any of these.\n\n448\n00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:14.660\nNone of my colors change on these.\n\n449\n00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:18.060\nI said those are like constants.\n\n450\n00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:20.500\nThey're hard coded if you wanna say.\n\n451\n00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.050\n&gt;&gt; Real quick,\nyou said your fonts didn't change but\n\n452\n00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:24.480\nwhen you selected that it\nstill showed the other font.\n\n453\n00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.740\nOr you just mean like the relative\nsizing and things like that?\n\n454\n00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:30.040\n&gt;&gt; Well, here let's go back to here.\n\n455\n00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:34.880\nIf you, if I go back to my layout and\nI go to themes.\n\n456\n00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.510\nAnd let's go back to that scary one,\nthe Main Event.\n\n457\n00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:38.360\nI did change my font.\n\n458\n00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:40.030\nYou know what, I'm wrong, okay.\n\n459\n00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:44.470\nWell, it changed the font,\nbut the color didn't change.\n\n460\n00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:49.358\n&gt;&gt; It is a reddish hue font,\nand a reddish background, and\n\n461\n00:22:49.358 --> 00:22:56.438\nit didn't change the relative sizing but\nit did actually apply the font family.\n\n462\n00:22:56.438 --> 00:23:00.650\n&gt;&gt; It did change the font,\nwhich I thought the font stayed solid.\n\n463\n00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:06.102\nBut the formatting of the fill and\nthe font color that did not change,\n\n464\n00:23:06.102 --> 00:23:09.490\nand the borders and everything like that.\n\n465\n00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:12.052\nSo yes,\nokay the font was the relative piece,\n\n466\n00:23:12.052 --> 00:23:16.077\nthe other parts were the hard coded parts,\nwe'll just call it that way.\n\n467\n00:23:16.077 --> 00:23:18.730\nNeat, so now with our themes,\nwe know that all that.\n\n468\n00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:20.040\nI know what I wanted to go to.\n\n469\n00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.460\nBack to our styles, oof, okay.\n\n470\n00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:26.830\nWith our styles,\nwe have heading 2s on here,\n\n471\n00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:28.600\nwe also have heading 2s on here, right?\n\n472\n00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:32.210\nSales, sales styles,\nI wanna change all of them.\n\n473\n00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:35.346\nThey all need to be green, 2 points,\n\n474\n00:23:35.346 --> 00:23:40.750\nthat's way too small okay 20 points and\nright aligned, okay?\n\n475\n00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:45.100\nYou don't go and change it and\nthen move along okay?\n\n476\n00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:47.749\nReally quickly do you see\nhow here okay I wanted to\n\n477\n00:23:47.749 --> 00:23:51.120\nshow you you see how there's\na different color going on here.\n\n478\n00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:56.121\nAnd just for fun you know we're\ngonna do this we're gonna make this\n\n479\n00:23:56.121 --> 00:24:00.780\nmore colors and we're going to\nhard code this to be pink okay?\n\n480\n00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:03.728\nJust keep with me,\nall of these are heading twos.\n\n481\n00:24:03.728 --> 00:24:07.536\nI go over here I want\nall of them to change.\n\n482\n00:24:07.536 --> 00:24:09.940\nDo not change it at the cell level.\n\n483\n00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:12.140\nYou change it at the style level.\n\n484\n00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:13.590\nSo I come over here.\n\n485\n00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:15.766\nI right-click on Heading 2.\n\n486\n00:24:15.766 --> 00:24:20.070\nAnd when I right click on Heading 2,\nyou're gonna go to Modify.\n\n487\n00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:24.890\nI'm at the style level where I'm\ngonna modify how this looks?\n\n488\n00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:28.900\nNow notice there are things in\nthe styles that you can tuck in there.\n\n489\n00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:33.220\nYou can tuck in the number format,\nthe alignment, the fill, the protection.\n\n490\n00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:36.940\nThis particular one is only\npulling in the font and\n\n491\n00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:39.650\nthe border, so\nthat's what the style definition.\n\n492\n00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:42.290\nBut you can put in all of this stuff.\n\n493\n00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:44.718\nHow do I get to it,\nyou come down here to format.\n\n494\n00:24:44.718 --> 00:24:48.960\nWhen I come to the format I'm right\nback in my format cells dialog box.\n\n495\n00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:55.762\nSo if I come in to font and I change\nthis to, I said green didn't I, right?\n\n496\n00:24:55.762 --> 00:24:58.110\nSo we'll go with green.\n\n497\n00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:03.120\nI want this to be a Apple Chancery.\n\n498\n00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:07.072\nI'd like this to be 16 points, and\n\n499\n00:25:07.072 --> 00:25:11.671\nI would like it to be Right aligned, okay.\n\n500\n00:25:11.671 --> 00:25:14.390\nAnd Top justified.\n\n501\n00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:16.020\nAll that kind of fun stuff.\n\n502\n00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:17.900\nRemember, I'm in the style definition.\n\n503\n00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:20.490\nLook at the preview up here,\nit's might be a little small,\n\n504\n00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:22.910\nbut that's the way I want it to look.\n\n505\n00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:24.928\nWhat if I wanted the border\nto be different?\n\n506\n00:25:24.928 --> 00:25:28.680\nYou have to go back down into Format,\ngo into the Border.\n\n507\n00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:32.070\nChange the color to be that light green.\n\n508\n00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:34.730\nRemember how borders work,\nyou gotta click the little button.\n\n509\n00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:36.950\nYou gotta make sure it looks like\nthis over here in the preview or\n\n510\n00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:38.430\nit doesn't apply.\n\n511\n00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:45.320\nSo I'm at the heading level and\nwhen I click OK, all of those changed.\n\n512\n00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.170\nMy border didn't apply but that's okay.\n\n513\n00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:50.400\nWe'll look at these,\nthose applied, those applied.\n\n514\n00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.360\nI just changed all of those.\n\n515\n00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:56.010\nWith one place because I used styles,\nokay?\n\n516\n00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:57.100\nSo back to that format painter.\n\n517\n00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:00.720\nWouldn't this be a lot easier than\nchanging them all on my own manually?\n\n518\n00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:02.080\n&gt;&gt; This is substantially easier.\n\n519\n00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:06.120\nAnd also once you get everything\nkind of relatively styled.\n\n520\n00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:07.840\nWhat I mean, this is a heading one,\n\n521\n00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:11.090\nthis is heading two,\nthese are subheadings and totals.\n\n522\n00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:14.120\nThen you can kinda tweak but\nthis does beg the question.\n\n523\n00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:17.890\nWe changed the style for a selected theme,\ndid we modify the theme across all\n\n524\n00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:21.580\nthe other ones or\ndid we just do it for this workbook?\n\n525\n00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.730\nOr did it create a custom one for us?\n\n526\n00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:26.570\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good question, it's only for\nthis workbook and only for\n\n527\n00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:28.030\nthat particular style, okay?\n\n528\n00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:29.480\nFirst is the heading two.\n\n529\n00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.080\nWe didn't mess with heading one or\nheading two.\n\n530\n00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:34.790\nSo, and if I started a new,\nI'm just doing Cmd+N, right?\n\n531\n00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:38.340\nAnd I'm using that same,\nI think we're on Madison or whatever.\n\n532\n00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:41.060\nIt's not going to affect those.\n\n533\n00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:44.840\nOkay, so\nMadison back over here to the heading two.\n\n534\n00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.310\nNotice it's back to it's default.\n\n535\n00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:48.750\nSo yes, workbook specific.\n\n536\n00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:53.582\nI don't need to save my\nchanges to that one.\n\n537\n00:26:53.582 --> 00:26:54.460\nTake note though.\n\n538\n00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:56.080\nLook at this one.\n\n539\n00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.100\nThat's still pink, isn't it?\n\n540\n00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:01.190\nThat's the same font\nwhy didn't that choose?\n\n541\n00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:03.064\nYou know about styles what is this?\n\n542\n00:27:03.064 --> 00:27:06.820\n&gt;&gt; I think we did not apply the style\nusing that selection we just kind of hard\n\n543\n00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:11.190\ncoded that to make it look like the ones\nthat were previously there, right?\n\n544\n00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:16.650\n&gt;&gt; Local overrides,\nit's like inline styles overriding, yes,\n\n545\n00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:20.490\nI'm talking code, but when I talk\nabout format and local overrides,\n\n546\n00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:24.070\nI came into here and\nphysically changed this to pin.\n\n547\n00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:29.470\nAnything that you're doing at a local\nlevel, like I selected these cells,\n\n548\n00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:33.880\nthat's going to override any\nstyles that I've applied.\n\n549\n00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:38.550\nStyles are more like up here like in the\nglobal, this is local applied formatting.\n\n550\n00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:43.110\nLocally applied formatting\nwill always win the globals.\n\n551\n00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:47.460\nAnd we're talking CSS-stuff about\nstyle sheets and inline styles,\n\n552\n00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:51.880\noverride embedded styles, and\nembedded styles override global styles.\n\n553\n00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:55.353\nIt's just a layer of who wins.\n\n554\n00:27:55.353 --> 00:27:59.860\nWhat definition wins out,\nand so be careful.\n\n555\n00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:03.620\nThat's why I said if you apply a style,\ndo not come in and go ahead and\n\n556\n00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:06.490\ngo other tweakings at the cell level.\n\n557\n00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:09.010\nDo it at the style level.\n\n558\n00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:11.360\nBecause otherwise it's\nnot going to go through.\n\n559\n00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.690\nNow, the cool thing I was like, well if I\nreally want this to look like the rest of\n\n560\n00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:20.110\nthem, you just select the text and\nthen just apply the style again, okay.\n\n561\n00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:23.420\nSo that's where you go in and\nmodify it and it's cool.\n\n562\n00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:27.530\nComing back over here to our.\n\n563\n00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:28.080\nDid I get rid?\n\n564\n00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.124\nNo, it's address.\n\n565\n00:28:29.124 --> 00:28:30.870\nThere we go.\nI'm like, where's pumpkin?\n\n566\n00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:33.110\nOkay, well, pumpkin's gone.\n\n567\n00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:36.875\nBut pumpkin right here,\nif I like this, the comic-sans,\n\n568\n00:28:36.875 --> 00:28:40.281\nthe 16, all of the alignment stuff,\neverything.\n\n569\n00:28:40.281 --> 00:28:42.290\nI want this to my own style.\n\n570\n00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:45.270\nIf they already have premade\nstyles who can I make my own?\n\n571\n00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:46.180\nYes, you can.\n\n572\n00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:50.104\nThe cool thing is, you go ahead and\nformat a cell and you really like this and\n\n573\n00:28:50.104 --> 00:28:52.551\nyou want to move it all over the place,\nright?\n\n574\n00:28:52.551 --> 00:28:57.020\nKinda going back to,\nI'm going back way too far.\n\n575\n00:28:57.020 --> 00:29:00.540\nOkay, kinda going back to here where\nall of these are just regular.\n\n576\n00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.150\nLet's go ahead and\nclear the formats like that.\n\n577\n00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:10.060\nI'd be a lot easier if I took\nthis made my own style, right?\n\n578\n00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:13.375\nDo my formats first, come in a new\ncell style, checking to make sure,\n\n579\n00:29:13.375 --> 00:29:16.430\nnow notice do I really wanna apply\nthe number formats and align.\n\n580\n00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:21.130\nIt's taking everything,\nI'll go with it, that's fine.\n\n581\n00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:23.940\nAnd then I just go ahead and\nname this pumpkin, okay.\n\n582\n00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:28.810\nAnd I click OK, I now have my own style.\n\n583\n00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:33.010\nSo if I come over here and use my control\nkey, or sorry, my command key, and\n\n584\n00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:39.100\nI get all of these, and then say,\nhey, let's all be a pumpkin.\n\n585\n00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:41.520\nAnd there you go,\nthat to me it's a little easier.\n\n586\n00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:45.060\nCuz then you know,\nyou need to make that a little different.\n\n587\n00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:47.260\nYou modify it, you change the font.\n\n588\n00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:48.190\nI'm going a little fast.\n\n589\n00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:53.477\nSo if I'm clicking a little too fast,\njust stay with me for visual purposes.\n\n590\n00:29:53.477 --> 00:29:55.480\nI'll make this pink, okay?\n\n591\n00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.266\nClick OK.\n\n592\n00:29:56.266 --> 00:29:57.770\nTurn that back on, perfect.\n\n593\n00:29:57.770 --> 00:29:59.800\nSo click OK, and then all of them change.\n\n594\n00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.610\nThis one didn't change because you\nactually never applied the style to it,\n\n595\n00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:04.960\nyou know how that is when you\ndo CSS style definitions.\n\n596\n00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:08.520\nSo I would just come back and\nthere you go.\n\n597\n00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:12.320\nI love styles, they're so much fun,\nthey can save you so much time.\n\n598\n00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:15.190\nEspecially if you have\na lot of worksheets but\n\n599\n00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:17.240\nyou're making everything look the same.\n\n600\n00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:20.220\nSomeone comes along and\nneeds you to change it.\n\n601\n00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:22.040\nIt's gonna hurt if you don't have styles.\n\n602\n00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:25.460\nSo knowing how they working,\nknowing they're connected to themes.\n\n603\n00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:29.910\nNow you know how to change your\ntheme colors over in PowerPoint, but\n\n604\n00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:30.600\nthat's what you got.\n\n605\n00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:33.470\nSo lots of fun, have a good time with it.\n\n606\n00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:37.549\n&gt;&gt; Von, that's definitely gonna make you\nmore productive as you try to try out\n\n607\n00:30:37.549 --> 00:30:38.280\nthings.\n\n608\n00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:40.390\nMaybe it's some for fun, some for\n\n609\n00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:45.320\nbusiness but you don't wanna be formatting\nkind of with that paint brush all of the.\n\n610\n00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:48.613\nIf you've ever painted an entire\nwall with a two inch paintbrush you\n\n611\n00:30:48.613 --> 00:30:49.667\nknow that's no fun.\n\n612\n00:30:49.667 --> 00:30:53.490\nJust remember, the closer\nthe style is to the thing, right?\n\n613\n00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:54.610\nIt's kind of like a person,\n\n614\n00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:57.760\nthe people closest to you\nhave the most effect on you.\n\n615\n00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:00.160\nPeoples furthest away have\nthe least affect on you.\n\n616\n00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.410\nAnd that's how styles work.\n\n617\n00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:03.312\nThank you so much Von and\nthank you for joining us.\n\n618\n00:31:03.312 --> 00:31:04.820\nWe're gonna go ahead and get out of here.\n\n619\n00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:07.520\nSo signing off for Office Pro TV,\nI've been your host Justin Ennis.\n\n620\n00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:12.130\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Von Smith.\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n621\n00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:17.797\n[SOUND]\n\n",

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.506 --> 00:00:17.425\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.425 --> 00:00:21.041\nwe're continuing on with our Excel\n2016 Essentials for Mac series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:24.060\nAnd what we're gonna be talking about,\nnumber formats.\n\n6\n00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.320\nI know, you're like I don't know,\ntrust me, they are very useful and well,\n\n7\n00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.020\nif you wanna be taken seriously you're\ndefinitely gonna need to know about them.\n\n8\n00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.470\nLuckily we have someone in the studio who\nknows all about them, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.958\nHow you doing today Vonne?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic, how you doing?\n\n10\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.632\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic Vonne.\n\n11\n00:00:39.632 --> 00:00:44.679\nNow number formats, it seems simple but\nyou and I have talked, outside\n\n12\n00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:50.250\nof the show, there's actually a lot more\nto them than one would first assume.\n\n13\n00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.910\nSo what do we need to know\nactually to get our feet wet\n\n14\n00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:53.740\nhere?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n15\n00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.530\nit's a very important part of Excel,\nand once you get the hang of it,\n\n16\n00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.990\nit seems pretty straightforward, but\n\n17\n00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:06.260\nI've watched newbies to Excel trip\nup on this time and time again.\n\n18\n00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.020\nI trip up on it from time to time as well.\n\n19\n00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.865\nSo it's a very big topic,\na very important topic, so\n\n20\n00:01:12.865 --> 00:01:16.830\nwhat I've decided to do is\nkind of break it on down.\n\n21\n00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.810\nWe're gonna break it down into\na little mini series as I call it.\n\n22\n00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.640\nSo we have a couple different episodes\nthat are going through all the different\n\n23\n00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.590\ntypes of number formats and show examples.\n\n24\n00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.070\nWe can talk a little bit about it, but\nthis first one is really just, well,\n\n25\n00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.050\nintroducing the concept of\nwhat is a number format.\n\n26\n00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.970\nWe just did our episodes about cell\nformats like changing the font,\n\n27\n00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.450\nand changing the font size, and the color,\nand the border, and the shading.\n\n28\n00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.720\nAnd what were we doing?\n\n29\n00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.738\nWe're changing the way something looks,\nright?\n\n30\n00:01:46.738 --> 00:01:54.860\nI want the Comic Sans or Curlz MT font\nbecause it gives a certain meaning.\n\n31\n00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.870\nUsing Comic Sans verses Courier,\n\n32\n00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.820\ntwo totally different feels of how\nwe're presenting the information.\n\n33\n00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.330\nWell, the same is true with numbers.\n\n34\n00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.830\nBut when you get into the world of\nnumbers, then you think of math and\n\n35\n00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.910\nhow it's displayed and then, gosh, I'm so\nglad you're here with me today, Justin.\n\n36\n00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.835\nBecause I know math and science and\nall that is near and dear to your heart.\n\n37\n00:02:18.835 --> 00:02:19.633\n&gt;&gt; It is, it is,\n\n38\n00:02:19.633 --> 00:02:23.385\nit was one of my first passions,\nobviously along with computing.\n\n39\n00:02:23.385 --> 00:02:25.893\nBut numbers are important because,\nyou know,\n\n40\n00:02:25.893 --> 00:02:28.286\nwhen someone is like I'm gonna pay you 50.\n\n41\n00:02:28.286 --> 00:02:28.833\n50 what?\n\n42\n00:02:28.833 --> 00:02:34.941\n$50, $0.50, 50 pesos, those units are\ndefinitely important when you're trying\n\n43\n00:02:34.941 --> 00:02:38.081\nto convey information appropriately.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n44\n00:02:38.081 --> 00:02:39.402\nmaybe $50 million?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n45\n00:02:39.402 --> 00:02:40.413\n&gt;&gt; That would be awesome!\n\n46\n00:02:40.413 --> 00:02:42.480\n[LAUGH] I would like that.\n\n47\n00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.940\nYeah, so exactly, it's very important to,\nlike what are we actually displaying?\n\n48\n00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.060\nAnd let's start there, so\nwe have an idea of okay,\n\n49\n00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.720\nwhat do I want my numbers to say,\nhow I want them displayed?\n\n50\n00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.850\nAnd we also have to think about like,\n\n51\n00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.205\nhow am I going to be\ninputting the data into it?\n\n52\n00:03:00.205 --> 00:03:04.450\nSo introduction to number formats,\nwhy don't we go ahead and jump down to my\n\n53\n00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.790\nscreen cuz we always need visuals to go\nahead and demonstrate our concepts here.\n\n54\n00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.606\nAll right, so\nwhat I have here is just some examples of,\n\n55\n00:03:13.606 --> 00:03:20.376\nit's gonna kind of exemplify the input,\nhow I typed it, versus the display.\n\n56\n00:03:20.376 --> 00:03:24.696\nVersus like well, you could have\nsomething be inputted the same way but\n\n57\n00:03:24.696 --> 00:03:26.570\nnot displayed the same.\n\n58\n00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.962\nI just did a total couple\ncircles right there.\n\n59\n00:03:28.962 --> 00:03:32.680\n[LAUGH] So\nwhy don't I zoom in a little bit here.\n\n60\n00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.810\nAnd so right here, the boxes that I\nhave on the left are column B, and\n\n61\n00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.040\nthen column D, they're actually the same.\n\n62\n00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:48.255\nThis is the same as this, and\nyou're like, [LAUGH] no it's not.\n\n63\n00:03:48.255 --> 00:03:51.749\nIt is, okay?\nAnd that was a whole 2,500, what?\n\n64\n00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:56.990\nDollars, cats,\nI mean what are we talking about here?\n\n65\n00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.590\nIs this just a number or\nis this actually like a monetary value?\n\n66\n00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.270\nHow do I know that this is $2500,\nlike what\n\n67\n00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.800\nwould indicate that to you there Justin?\n&gt;&gt; Well we have the currency symbol there\n\n68\n00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.170\nand this is US dollars, so we have\nthe currency symbol for US dollars.\n\n69\n00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.069\nOn the left hand side is 2,500 and\nas you said it could be 2,500 cats,\n\n70\n00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:20.324\nyou're probably gonna need a lot more\nthan $2500 if you have 2,500 cats but\n\n71\n00:04:20.324 --> 00:04:22.820\nmaybe that's best spent on another time.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n72\n00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.460\n&gt;&gt; The units here are very\n\n73\n00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.510\nindicative of your intentions.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah definitely, and\n\n74\n00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.780\neven the next one right here,\nlike the decimal point.\n\n75\n00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.162\nHow important is that decimal point\nin how we're measuring things?\n\n76\n00:04:39.162 --> 00:04:41.368\nI mean and that's where,\ndo we measure it in whole?\n\n77\n00:04:41.368 --> 00:04:44.630\nLike this, and these are two completely\ndifferent numbers aren't they?\n\n78\n00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.310\nBecause of where the decimal place is,\nand where is that comma,\n\n79\n00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.530\nso I can tell that this is $12,000.\n\n80\n00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.870\nSo you can already get the idea, so\n\n81\n00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.160\nmany different ways that\nwe can display a number.\n\n82\n00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.238\nHow about this next one?\n\n83\n00:04:56.238 --> 00:04:58.651\n2, versus 1.568921.\n\n84\n00:04:58.651 --> 00:05:04.545\nYeah, but I mean if we're talking\nabout the rules of rounding,\n\n85\n00:05:04.545 --> 00:05:11.652\n1.56 is rounded up to the nearest\nwhole decimal, and that's 2, okay?\n\n86\n00:05:11.652 --> 00:05:14.590\nBut again, what are we measuring?\n\n87\n00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.510\nDo we need this many decimal places?\n\n88\n00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:17.960\nDo we need to round up?\n\n89\n00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.986\nIt's a big deal when you're\ndisplaying data and numbers, okay and\n\n90\n00:05:21.986 --> 00:05:24.761\nenough of course my favorite fractions,\nright?\n\n91\n00:05:24.761 --> 00:05:28.610\nWhoo-hoo, yeah decimals and fractions,\nand I do a pretty good job.\n\n92\n00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.842\nBut then if you, I think about you know,\nour fourth and fifth grade math,\n\n93\n00:05:31.842 --> 00:05:34.816\nI'm like if I was given like a fifth\ngrade math test after right now,\n\n94\n00:05:34.816 --> 00:05:36.525\nI don't know [LAUGH] if I could do that.\n\n95\n00:05:36.525 --> 00:05:41.187\nConvert fractions and all like kind of\nstuff, and you flip it and times, whoo,\n\n96\n00:05:41.187 --> 00:05:43.891\nyeah, [LAUGH] kind of scary.\n&gt;&gt; Well it's not scary to me,\n\n97\n00:05:43.891 --> 00:05:45.781\nI would crush it.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n98\n00:05:45.781 --> 00:05:46.776\n&gt;&gt; I hope I would crush,\n\n99\n00:05:46.776 --> 00:05:50.482\nyou never know though, and math does\nchange and what's taught at the fourth and\n\n100\n00:05:50.482 --> 00:05:54.490\nfifth grade level maybe there's things\nthat I've forgotten so who's knows there.\n\n101\n00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.617\nBut I do wanna bring up a key point,\nnot only does it help with our intentions,\n\n102\n00:05:58.617 --> 00:06:00.279\nwhat we're trying to convey.\n\n103\n00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:04.080\nIt also helps with readability\nto some capacity, right?\n\n104\n00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.173\nYou're like well is it 1.568921?\n\n105\n00:06:07.173 --> 00:06:10.512\nWell, if you're talking about taxes\nI know when I input my taxes,\n\n106\n00:06:10.512 --> 00:06:14.446\nyou actually get a round up or round up or\na round down based on the penny amount,\n\n107\n00:06:14.446 --> 00:06:16.857\nbecause they care about\nwhole dollar amounts.\n\n108\n00:06:16.857 --> 00:06:21.465\nAnd well if you're doing a tax sheet,\nrounding may be applicable to you and\n\n109\n00:06:21.465 --> 00:06:25.635\nit allows you to get a quick glance\nof the monetary amounts without,\n\n110\n00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:28.290\nwell there's 13 decimals places here.\n\n111\n00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.000\nWhat am I supposed to do, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and talking about taxes,\n\n112\n00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.850\nI haven't done mine yet.\n\n113\n00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.648\nOops, got a month, right.\n\n114\n00:06:34.648 --> 00:06:37.040\n[LAUGH] It's a, yeah, bad subject.\n\n115\n00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.448\n[LAUGH] But anyways, yeah,\nthat's a great example though of when and\n\n116\n00:06:41.448 --> 00:06:43.510\nwhy we might need these things.\n\n117\n00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:44.600\nAnd do you need fractions?\n\n118\n00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.380\nDo you need decimals?\n\n119\n00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.390\nHow many places?\n\n120\n00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:48.240\nAll that kind of fun stuff.\n\n121\n00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.400\nAnd the other thing to kind of think of,\nand\n\n122\n00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.295\nyou can see some of the other examples\nof like I need preceeding zeroes.\n\n123\n00:06:54.295 --> 00:06:56.400\nThat's a fun one in Excel.\n\n124\n00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.650\nDo I need decimal place?\n\n125\n00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:58.430\nSorry, what is that?\n\n126\n00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:59.639\nThat's a percentage, right?\n\n127\n00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:01.522\n[LAUGH] That really is a decimal, right?\n\n128\n00:07:01.522 --> 00:07:04.780\nAnd then gosh, what is that thing and\nwhy is it looking like that?\n\n129\n00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.213\nI don't even know what that is,\nand why does it keep popping up?\n\n130\n00:07:07.213 --> 00:07:13.453\nThese are going to be things that you're\ngoing to [LAUGH] battle with in Excel,\n\n131\n00:07:13.453 --> 00:07:17.869\nbecause of the way Excel\ntreats this information, and\n\n132\n00:07:17.869 --> 00:07:20.951\nwhat it has kind of built into its DNA.\n\n133\n00:07:20.951 --> 00:07:23.837\nLike it inherently does these things for\nyou,\n\n134\n00:07:23.837 --> 00:07:27.315\nsometimes when you don't want it to,\nand other times,\n\n135\n00:07:27.315 --> 00:07:31.246\nit just won't do it unless you tell\nit you have to do it this way.\n\n136\n00:07:31.246 --> 00:07:37.330\nAnd this is all about cell formatting, but\nmore specifically, number formats, okay?\n\n137\n00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.040\nBig, big deal and so\nwe're going to be talking about that.\n\n138\n00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.720\nNow look at this, up on the Formula bar,\n\n139\n00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.700\nremember we talked this\narea right up here.\n\n140\n00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.340\nThis is a very important place for\na lot of different reasons, and\n\n141\n00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.980\nwhile I'm zoomed in here, right here.\n\n142\n00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:56.135\nThis shows 1.56 da da da, and\nup at the Formula bar, it says that.\n\n143\n00:07:56.135 --> 00:07:57.950\nThen I click over here, okay?\n\n144\n00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:59.906\nWhoa, no!\nBy the way, let me just show you,\n\n145\n00:07:59.906 --> 00:08:01.773\nsee here, here, it is switching.\n\n146\n00:08:01.773 --> 00:08:04.980\nLike if I click on this\ncell It looks the same.\n\n147\n00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:10.347\nLook at the formula bar, but\nlook at what it says, that it's 2.\n\n148\n00:08:10.347 --> 00:08:14.295\nBig example right here of inputted value.\n\n149\n00:08:14.295 --> 00:08:19.643\nI typed in 1.568921 but\n\n150\n00:08:19.643 --> 00:08:23.013\nit shows me it as 2.\n\n151\n00:08:23.013 --> 00:08:27.947\nOkay so, we talked about this in our\nrelational database design show,\n\n152\n00:08:27.947 --> 00:08:33.375\nthat I did with Mike and Ronny about what\nyou actually input versus what a mask,\n\n153\n00:08:33.375 --> 00:08:36.747\nwhat it's masking and\nactually showing you, or\n\n154\n00:08:36.747 --> 00:08:39.570\nmaybe I'm kind of confusing contexts.\n\n155\n00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:43.900\nBut anyways, it's what you enter in\nversus how it displays on the screen or\n\n156\n00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.270\nreport that you're doing.\n\n157\n00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:47.650\nTwo huge, very different concepts,\n\n158\n00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:51.440\nbut can be kinda confusing.\n&gt;&gt; Those definitely can be confusing,\n\n159\n00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.230\nbut essentially draws to a point.\n\n160\n00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:57.260\nHey, I still want to have\nthis as the number, but\n\n161\n00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.060\nI want to represent it differently.\n\n162\n00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.470\nIn my world,\nwe sometimes call that a view.\n\n163\n00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:05.662\nWe're changing how it's viewed,\nnot the underlying data.\n\n164\n00:09:05.662 --> 00:09:09.064\nBut it does bring up a good question,\nwell I think it's a good question, so\n\n165\n00:09:09.064 --> 00:09:10.930\nI'm gonna say it is.\n\n166\n00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:16.108\nFor this respective cell, if I were\nuse this in some other calculations,\n\n167\n00:09:16.108 --> 00:09:21.464\nwould it use 2, or would it use\n1.568921 as the underlying value?\n\n168\n00:09:21.464 --> 00:09:24.389\nIt can get a little iffy there, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\n\n169\n00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:30.158\nthat's where if you were adding this\ncell and this cell to equal amount here,\n\n170\n00:09:30.158 --> 00:09:33.632\nit also depends on how\nis this cell formatted.\n\n171\n00:09:33.632 --> 00:09:35.312\nOkay so it's all about yes,\n\n172\n00:09:35.312 --> 00:09:38.464\nthe data underneath is going\nto do the calculations,\n\n173\n00:09:38.464 --> 00:09:42.893\nbut how you display it in the resulting\ncell makes a big difference as well.\n\n174\n00:09:42.893 --> 00:09:45.079\nCuz you might actually\nhave this display as four,\n\n175\n00:09:45.079 --> 00:09:48.160\ncuz you're rounding it up to\nthat particular decimal point.\n\n176\n00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.320\nOr you want to show all\nthe decimal places, so\n\n177\n00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.840\nit's gonna show you, and that's why.\n\n178\n00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.918\nThis little area, so\nwe're talking about okay, got it.\n\n179\n00:09:55.918 --> 00:09:57.800\nI can see that we can format our numbers.\n\n180\n00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.480\nHow do I know and\nwhere do I do all of this?\n\n181\n00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:04.780\nThat's up here, in this area\non the home tab of the ribbon,\n\n182\n00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.990\nwhere it says general and it has some\ndollar signs and some percentages.\n\n183\n00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.064\nThis is your number formats, okay.\n\n184\n00:10:10.064 --> 00:10:16.940\nSo that's what you should always be\naware of what this says right here.\n\n185\n00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:22.610\nCuz if I drop this down, here are some\nof your most common number formats.\n\n186\n00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:27.197\nCuz you can format something as currency,\nor a date or a percentage, or\n\n187\n00:10:27.197 --> 00:10:30.187\na fraction, so that's what I've done here.\n\n188\n00:10:30.187 --> 00:10:33.526\nAnd the other biggest thing is these\nare just the ones that have as a quick\n\n189\n00:10:33.526 --> 00:10:35.990\nreference, like your quick select.\n\n190\n00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:38.140\nDown here there are more number formats.\n\n191\n00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:42.960\nWhen I click on this, and\nI zoom out, where am I?\n\n192\n00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.020\nI'm in the format styles dialog box.\n\n193\n00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:46.900\nWe've been here quite a few times already.\n\n194\n00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:50.530\nWe were in the borders, and\nthe fill, and the font.\n\n195\n00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:53.560\nYeah, well number formats\nare right along the same lines.\n\n196\n00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.480\nSo the format cells,\n\n197\n00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.990\nwhere we could have gotten to by\nright clicking in format cells.\n\n198\n00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:01.770\nYou could also go up to\nthe format menu and go to cells.\n\n199\n00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:03.440\nIt's all going to take\nyou the same places, so\n\n200\n00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:08.240\nyou had even more options\nin your number formats\n\n201\n00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:13.080\nfrom that dialog box versus just\nthe quick reference drop downs of them.\n\n202\n00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.050\nSo let's look at some of these.\n\n203\n00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:20.590\nIf I am in a brand new worksheet, and\nI'll just do a file, new just to show you.\n\n204\n00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:27.370\nWhen you start any new workbook, you\nare always in the general number format.\n\n205\n00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:28.750\nThat's what you start in, okay?\n\n206\n00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:31.190\nGeneral is well, it's just general.\n\n207\n00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:33.640\nIt's like the default,\nand that's what you do.\n\n208\n00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.520\nSo that means it's kinda like a catch all,\nif you wanna say.\n\n209\n00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.850\nSo if I typed in, and let me zoom\nin a little bit so we can see this.\n\n210\n00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:42.120\nI typed in Justin, right.\n\n211\n00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:46.493\nThat's still just saying\nthat it is general.\n\n212\n00:11:46.493 --> 00:11:50.700\nIf I type in 12345, that's a number.\n\n213\n00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:54.966\nWhat if I type in 0.5678?\n\n214\n00:11:54.966 --> 00:11:56.064\nThat's a number.\n\n215\n00:11:56.064 --> 00:12:01.260\nSo all of these things, it's gonna\njust kinda keep in whatever you type.\n\n216\n00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.420\nWell, kind of.\n\n217\n00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:07.276\nAnd that's where had those inherent,\nI'm gonna flip over.\n\n218\n00:12:07.276 --> 00:12:12.149\nI'm gonna keep that thought just for\na second, and then come back around to it,\n\n219\n00:12:12.149 --> 00:12:14.986\ncuz I wanna come back over\nto this worksheet and\n\n220\n00:12:14.986 --> 00:12:17.940\nshow you that this right here is a date.\n\n221\n00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.640\nI formatted that cell as a date.\n\n222\n00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.090\nThis one is formatted as accounting.\n\n223\n00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:27.510\nThis is formatted as a,\nthat's accounting too.\n\n224\n00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:29.420\nThat actually should be a number but\nthat's okay.\n\n225\n00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:30.570\nWe'll just keep on going.\n\n226\n00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:31.472\nLet's go to this one.\n\n227\n00:12:31.472 --> 00:12:33.110\nThere's my number, right?\n\n228\n00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:36.360\nOkay, but\nthen this one over here is general.\n\n229\n00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:40.180\nSo you see that these are two different\nthings that I've kind of just\n\n230\n00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:41.420\nchanged how they look.\n\n231\n00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:42.280\nHere is general.\n\n232\n00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.930\nHere is a fraction.\n\n233\n00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.490\nI think you get the idea.\n\n234\n00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:51.810\nText, percentage, text,\nokay, versus scientific.\n\n235\n00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:56.520\nAll of these cells have different ways,\nbut if I did this.\n\n236\n00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.180\nWhoops, sorry that's the wrong button,\nwrong program.\n\n237\n00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:02.730\nIf I zoom out and\nI selected all these cells, and\n\n238\n00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:05.780\nI switched them all back to general.\n\n239\n00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.240\nThat's way different\nlooking than where I was.\n\n240\n00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:13.040\nSo it's just changing\nthe format of those numbers.\n\n241\n00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:16.760\nSo, I'm gonna undo so\nyou can see that that's, oops, sorry,\n\n242\n00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.580\nit's undoing my zooms, there we go.\n\n243\n00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:21.240\nNow you can see that these\nare the way that they are formatted.\n\n244\n00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:25.970\nSo always looking up here will make a huge\ndifference to you as you go through this,\n\n245\n00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:27.580\nand like why is this happening?\n\n246\n00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:31.500\nBecause these down here, let's scroll\ndown a little bit and I'll zoom in so\n\n247\n00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:32.370\nyou can see it again.\n\n248\n00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:37.060\nSo I have these color coded for\na couple different reasons.\n\n249\n00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:39.130\nLike this looks like a regular number.\n\n250\n00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:42.060\nThis looks like text and\nthis looks like a fraction.\n\n251\n00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:45.780\nSo that's why if I come in to here and\n\n252\n00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:50.251\ntype 0.58, why does that say 4/7?\n\n253\n00:13:50.251 --> 00:13:57.270\nAnd the another thing, 4/7, you can even\nread that as April 7th couldn't you?\n\n254\n00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.370\nBecause it's kind of how we read dates.\n\n255\n00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:01.208\nHad you ever have this happen to you,\nJustin?\n\n256\n00:14:01.208 --> 00:14:02.919\nWhere you type something in and like,\n\n257\n00:14:02.919 --> 00:14:06.091\nwhy did it do that?\n&gt;&gt; This is a very common issue if you're\n\n258\n00:14:06.091 --> 00:14:07.882\nnot aware of how things are,\n\n259\n00:14:07.882 --> 00:14:12.071\nespecially if you're using\na worksheet that was provided to you.\n\n260\n00:14:12.071 --> 00:14:15.205\nI've used these worksheet,\ntest this out, see how.\n\n261\n00:14:15.205 --> 00:14:19.381\nThey're trying to give you a relationship\nbetween things, property appraisals or\n\n262\n00:14:19.381 --> 00:14:20.900\nthings of that nature.\n\n263\n00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.820\nIf you're not aware of the formatting,\nyou're like, well,\n\n264\n00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:27.100\nwait a minute, is that a date,\nis that a fraction?\n\n265\n00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:27.800\nWhat is there?\n\n266\n00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:31.880\nOr maybe four seventh is actually is the\nfourth out of the seventh lots that we've\n\n267\n00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:32.600\nlooked at.\n\n268\n00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.720\nMaybe it's a designation.\n\n269\n00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:36.330\nYou have to be careful here.\n\n270\n00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:38.478\nIt can, well it can wreck your day,\nnot gonna lie.\n\n271\n00:14:38.478 --> 00:14:39.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly.\n\n272\n00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.300\nWhat is like the whole,\nalmost like the connotation?\n\n273\n00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.320\nWhat's the meaning on that number\nin that particular column?\n\n274\n00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.710\nSo, having proper column\nheadings is aways good.\n\n275\n00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:52.138\nAnd then yeah, if I'm typing\nsomething in like right over here,\n\n276\n00:14:52.138 --> 00:14:56.983\nif I'm like this looks like a number,\nso let's type in 4567.\n\n277\n00:14:56.983 --> 00:15:01.623\nTuesday, July 2nd, 1912, what?\n\n278\n00:15:01.623 --> 00:15:04.580\nI typed in a number,\nwhy is it giving me a date?\n\n279\n00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:08.412\nBecause these cells in these colors\nright here, they're formatted as dates.\n\n280\n00:15:08.412 --> 00:15:14.580\nIf I came over to here and\ntyped in 145, okay what's 145?\n\n281\n00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:15.660\nOne point four five?\n\n282\n00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:19.150\nOkay, cuz it turned as a fraction.\n\n283\n00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:23.428\nSo that's where I want 45,\nand then it's $45.\n\n284\n00:15:23.428 --> 00:15:26.440\nThis happens like, I don't understand\nwhy it keeps doing this to me.\n\n285\n00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.220\nYou have to look at the cell formatting.\n\n286\n00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.940\nYou have to look at the number\nformats to understand what it's doing.\n\n287\n00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:33.300\nAnd that's why looking up here and\n\n288\n00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:38.360\nunderstanding what that thing says\nup there on the selected cell\n\n289\n00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:43.160\nyou have is gonna make a huge\ndifference as to why and how it's\n\n290\n00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.315\ndisplaying your numbers a certain way.\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonn,\n\n291\n00:15:45.315 --> 00:15:47.914\nthere is something that I wanna\ndraw people's attentions to.\n\n292\n00:15:47.914 --> 00:15:52.920\nThat 1.45 that became a one and\nfour ninths, there are some\n\n293\n00:15:52.920 --> 00:16:00.710\ncoercions that can occur because four\nninths is technically 0.44444 forever.\n\n294\n00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.532\nAnd Excel's like, that's pretty close.\n\n295\n00:16:02.532 --> 00:16:06.189\nSo do keep in mind there may be\nsome precision or accuracy loss,\n\n296\n00:16:06.189 --> 00:16:09.400\ndepending on the format,\nhow you're viewing it.\n\n297\n00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:13.260\nThe underlying data hasn't changed,\nbut how you're viewing it and\n\n298\n00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:17.520\nhow you're reasoning about it may change\nbased on the context of the format\n\n299\n00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.796\nthat is provided to you.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and right up there,\n\n300\n00:16:19.796 --> 00:16:21.750\nlook at the Formula Bar, it's still 1.45.\n\n301\n00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:25.084\nAnd because we have a how\nit's going to take and\n\n302\n00:16:25.084 --> 00:16:29.020\nfractionalize [LAUGH] make\nit into a fraction based on,\n\n303\n00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:35.190\nare we going to the tenth, the hundredth,\nlike a place holder or a decimal place.\n\n304\n00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:36.110\nHow far are we going?\n\n305\n00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:37.690\nSo that makes a huge difference.\n\n306\n00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:39.410\nSo big thing to understand.\n\n307\n00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:43.160\nThe other thing I wanna go over\nin this particular episode is\n\n308\n00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:48.470\nwhat happens when you're inputting\ninformation in the general cell format?\n\n309\n00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:49.780\nSo I'm just gonna come out here and\n\n310\n00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.260\nI'm just gonna click on here\ncuz it says general, right?\n\n311\n00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:56.473\nSo like we just saw Justin date,\nbut what if I type in\n\n312\n00:16:56.473 --> 00:17:02.750\n4/7/18 oops that's not a 1, 18.\n\n313\n00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:03.530\nThat's a date isn't it?\n\n314\n00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:05.710\nAnd it did it.\n\n315\n00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:09.567\nWhat if I typed in 2-2-2?\n\n316\n00:17:09.567 --> 00:17:12.757\nThat's to why's it doing that?\n\n317\n00:17:12.757 --> 00:17:16.640\nAnd if I go back up to it, look if I\nselect this cell, it turned it to a date.\n\n318\n00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:21.440\nThis is the default Functioning of Excel.\n\n319\n00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.520\nWhen it sees in a general cell formatting,\n\n320\n00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:28.810\nyou started typing in what looks like\na date, it's gonna flip it for you.\n\n321\n00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:31.140\nIt will turn it into a date.\n\n322\n00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.800\nAnd this happens to me, like,\nwhen we're doing our episodes,\n\n323\n00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:38.490\nbecause we have a number convention\nthat we do, we have our episode,\n\n324\n00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:41.993\nI think this one is 2-4-1, right?\n\n325\n00:17:41.993 --> 00:17:44.890\nAnd if I had 2-1-2,\n\n326\n00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:50.820\nwell it thinks it's a date, no,\nthis is how we do our numbering.\n\n327\n00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:51.850\nSo why are you flipping?\n\n328\n00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:53.930\nStop doing that, just does it.\n\n329\n00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:56.250\nThat's what Excel does.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n330\n00:17:56.250 --> 00:18:00.690\nthis default behavior is something where\nMicrosoft is trying to be helpful.\n\n331\n00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:03.600\nRight, these are commonly\naccepted date formats, right?\n\n332\n00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:08.330\nDashes, slashes, others,\nprobably a plethora of other ones.\n\n333\n00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:12.950\nThen it's like, you probably meant date\nfor this, and it's trying to helpful.\n\n334\n00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:15.340\nWhich may not always be what you want, so\n\n335\n00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:19.050\nyou need to be aware of these,\nwhich follow a question to this.\n\n336\n00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:21.310\nIf I put a dollar sign there in the front,\n\n337\n00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:25.010\ndoes it automatically change it to\na currency, or an accounting field, or\n\n338\n00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:28.180\nis it just predominately for dates.\n&gt;&gt; So if I did dollar sign 15,\n\n339\n00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:31.800\nit just sees that as dollars.\n\n340\n00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.490\nNow it does flip the currency.\n\n341\n00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:36.770\nSo it did do it,\nwhich is very different than accounting.\n\n342\n00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:39.030\nThe currency and\ncounting are not the same.\n\n343\n00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:41.210\nWe'll get there.\n\n344\n00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:42.080\nWe're gonna explain all.\n\n345\n00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.180\nLike I said, we're gonna go\nthrough each number format and\n\n346\n00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:45.740\nreally give you examples and\neverything like that.\n\n347\n00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:50.900\nBut yeah, all those defaults of How you\ntype it in is gonna make a difference.\n\n348\n00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.930\nThe other one that drives\n[SOUND] me crazy because,\n\n349\n00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:56.490\nworking at the university,\nsection numbers.\n\n350\n00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:58.742\nYou've taught at many levels, so\n\n351\n00:18:58.742 --> 00:19:02.870\nits sections numbers was a big\nthing where gonna do in classes.\n\n352\n00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:08.520\nWell the thing is we had a lot of section\nnumbers that were like this, like 1E24.\n\n353\n00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:14.380\nReally, that's not it at all, right?\n\n354\n00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:15.620\nWhat is that?\n\n355\n00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:17.860\nThis is scientific notation.\n\n356\n00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:22.810\nAnd it is,\nreally it thinks I'm doing that.\n\n357\n00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:23.830\nWell, this is really big.\n\n358\n00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:29.390\nThat is not what I wanted it to be and\nthere is no way you can turn that off.\n\n359\n00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:32.310\nIt is just, let me show you,\ncuz I wanted to bring this up.\n\n360\n00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:33.830\nWhoops, I have it down here.\n\n361\n00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:39.370\nSo these two things that bother me [LAUGH]\nis that hey, it's gonna change your date.\n\n362\n00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:42.170\nThis could be very frustrating\nwhen you don't want it to change.\n\n363\n00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:44.440\nLook it, unfortunately,\nthere's no way to turn this off.\n\n364\n00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:47.770\nOkay, thanks.\n\n365\n00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:50.020\nSo you have to do workarounds, okay?\n\n366\n00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:52.500\nAnd it says, pre-format the cells\nyou want to enter in as text.\n\n367\n00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.860\nThat is the biggest way to change it.\n\n368\n00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.940\nWe will talk about that when we do it.\n\n369\n00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.290\nThere's also some other things.\n\n370\n00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:01.860\nLike you can put a space\nbefore you enter a number.\n\n371\n00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.200\nI don't remember to do that.\n\n372\n00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.190\nI mean, but\nthey do have some ways that like,\n\n373\n00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:09.160\nhey, this is the way it's going to do it.\n\n374\n00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.840\nThere is no way that you\ncan get around this so\n\n375\n00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:15.500\nyou just have to be aware of it and\nwork around it.\n\n376\n00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.780\nThe other one,\ndisabling scientific notation.\n\n377\n00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:20.430\nIs there any way,\nthis is a built-in behavior.\n\n378\n00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:22.122\nThere is no control over it.\n\n379\n00:20:22.122 --> 00:20:26.970\nAll right, so you know,\nwhat because I had to do\n\n380\n00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:31.770\nthings like enter in section numbers\nall the time that had an e in it.\n\n381\n00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:35.745\nI had to make sure that if I was\nentering that information in that shell,\n\n382\n00:20:35.745 --> 00:20:39.905\nit has to be a text format\nbefore I even enter it.\n\n383\n00:20:39.905 --> 00:20:41.335\nI can't change it after the fact.\n\n384\n00:20:41.335 --> 00:20:43.305\nIt has to be pre-formatted.\n\n385\n00:20:43.305 --> 00:20:47.445\nThat's another big thing about\nnumber formats and entering in data.\n\n386\n00:20:47.445 --> 00:20:52.155\nSometimes you cannot change it,\nor fix it or\n\n387\n00:20:52.155 --> 00:20:57.550\nchange its format after the fact\nIt has to be pre-formatted and\n\n388\n00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:01.960\nyou have to enter it in that way,\ncuz otherwise it can't understand\n\n389\n00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:07.890\nthe value of that data for\nit to be able to translate it for you.\n\n390\n00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:11.100\nIt's frustrating, and it is annoying.\n\n391\n00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:14.110\nSometimes you don't think that far ahead,\nbut\n\n392\n00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:17.060\nyou're gonna have to for certain reasons.\n&gt;&gt; Now I did see something else on one\n\n393\n00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:21.800\nof those pages where it says\nyou can prepend an apostrophe.\n\n394\n00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.870\nNow depending on your background,\nyou may go, that looks very similar.\n\n395\n00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:28.380\nI know some programming languages\nwhere that provides a literal,\n\n396\n00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:31.240\nlike I want to treat this as raw data.\n\n397\n00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:36.358\nSo if you're coming from that background\nthat may seem more intuitive to you, but\n\n398\n00:21:36.358 --> 00:21:41.699\nI do wonder, does putting that apostrophe\nin the beginning in front of that 1E34,\n\n399\n00:21:41.699 --> 00:21:48.770\ndoes that make it stay 1E34?\n&gt;&gt; It changes text.\n\n400\n00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:50.210\n&gt;&gt; It changes its text,\n\n401\n00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:54.770\nso that's a little bit of a shortcut\nthat could be helpful to you, right?\n\n402\n00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:58.790\nIt is kind of aggravating, especially\nif you're like a looking at a sheet and\n\n403\n00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:01.430\njust [SOUND] right, on your num pad.\n\n404\n00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:05.170\nI would probably just preform at\nthe cells instead of worrying about\n\n405\n00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:05.930\nnow how do I do that?\n\n406\n00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:11.140\nYou're gonna have an apostrophe, but\nI can get a little bit of a [SOUND],\n\n407\n00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:13.130\nit'll slow you down.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly and\n\n408\n00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:17.540\nthat's where, because I know of this,\nI'll just go ahead and pre-format.\n\n409\n00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:21.650\nAnd it's a lot easier for me than\nhaving to remember the apostrophe or\n\n410\n00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:23.200\na space before it.\n\n411\n00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.830\nSo I just know to format and\nI'm good to go.\n\n412\n00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:29.280\nSo that is definitely something to\nknow and but yeah, to each his own.\n\n413\n00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.730\nAnd everybody has their own reasons\nof why they like to do things,\n\n414\n00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:33.190\nso definitely keep that in mind.\n\n415\n00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:38.590\nAnd then last thing I wanna talk about\nin this introduction Is all about this.\n\n416\n00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:43.030\nWe talked a little bit about this\nin the last episode about clearing.\n\n417\n00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:47.802\nIf I took this and I went ahead and\njust, whoops, selected those and\n\n418\n00:22:47.802 --> 00:22:51.680\njust hit the backspace or\nthe delete key it deleted it.\n\n419\n00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:55.183\nSay you come along and you're like yeah,\nall right, let's go ahead and\n\n420\n00:22:55.183 --> 00:22:57.830\ntype in 1,2,3,4, and then there's a date.\n\n421\n00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:02.970\nOr if I come into here and\nI type in 1.58 and then it does this.\n\n422\n00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:06.135\nSo those are the whole, yes,\nyou delete the contents, but\n\n423\n00:23:06.135 --> 00:23:09.950\nyou're not deleting the formats,\nand that includes number formats.\n\n424\n00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:12.690\nThe last one we saw was fills and\nborders, so\n\n425\n00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:16.660\nthat's a visual representation,\nhey, something's formatted here.\n\n426\n00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:20.130\nNumber formats are kind of hidden,\nif you wanna say.\n\n427\n00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:25.320\nThey kinda lurk in the background,\nso there's not a font or a size or\n\n428\n00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:32.600\ncolor differentiation, so when you\nclear all of this when I clear all,\n\n429\n00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:38.100\nthen all of these cells are back\nto the general number format.\n\n430\n00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:44.750\nAnd so when you type in that 1, 2, 3,\n4 here it's just the number again.\n\n431\n00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:48.820\nSo be aware of deleting that information,\nbut\n\n432\n00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:54.290\nit holds onto that number format\nunless you clear all of the contents.\n\n433\n00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:59.520\nOr you could take this in reverse, and\nif I'm just undoing, I could take all this\n\n434\n00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:05.290\nand I wanna just give me back the regular\ndata, just clear the formats and\n\n435\n00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:09.610\nthen it goes back to the general or\nnumber format that it was entered into.\n\n436\n00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:13.450\nOr it converts it like changes fractions\nand all that kind of fun stuff so\n\n437\n00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:14.490\nthen you get your numbers.\n\n438\n00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:19.130\nSo that will always happen with\nthe clearing of your information or\n\n439\n00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:20.930\nyour formats or both.\n\n440\n00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:24.760\nSo that's my introduction\nto number formats.\n\n441\n00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:28.590\nHopefully, it gives you a nice\nintroduction [LAUGH] to it.\n\n442\n00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:32.220\nWe're gonna go through and\nstart talking about our decimal places and\n\n443\n00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:35.780\nour custom number formats and,\nthe world of dates.\n\n444\n00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:36.580\nIt's so much fun.\n\n445\n00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:39.520\nSo we'll have lots more for you.\n&gt;&gt; Well I definitely have a question about\n\n446\n00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:42.520\nthat date and how those numbers\nare related because I was trying to find\n\n447\n00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:43.730\na pattern during this episode.\n\n448\n00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:46.670\nAnd it seemed like it was,\nwell, all over the place.\n\n449\n00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:48.040\nAnd if you think about it,\n\n450\n00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:50.870\nnumber formats are very much\nlike those other visual formats.\n\n451\n00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:53.990\nIt is a visual representation\nof the underlying data.\n\n452\n00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:57.380\nSo it makes sense that it follows\nsome of the other formating rules.\n\n453\n00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:59.360\nBut we're just getting started\non these many series so\n\n454\n00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.530\ncome on back to see how\nthose dates work out.\n\n455\n00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:03.330\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n456\n00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:04.500\nSo signing off for OfficePro.TV.\n\n457\n00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:06.858\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n458\n00:25:06.858 --> 00:25:09.187\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n459\n00:25:09.187 --> 00:25:15.009\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.970\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison, and\n\n4\n00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.898\nwe're continuing on with our\nminiseries about number formats.\n\n5\n00:00:19.898 --> 00:00:22.930\nAnd we're gonna be looking at\ncommon number formats, and\n\n6\n00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.160\nthis is part of Excel 2016 essentials for\nMac.\n\n7\n00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.170\nWell, I know a little bit about numbers\nbut not in the context of Excel, but\n\n8\n00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.070\nluckily we do have someone in studio\nwho does, and that's one Bonn Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.132\nHow are you doing today Bonn?\n&gt;&gt; That was\n\n10\n00:00:37.132 --> 00:00:39.145\nsuch an energetic introduction.\n\n11\n00:00:39.145 --> 00:00:39.944\nI'm so excited right now.\n\n12\n00:00:39.944 --> 00:00:43.549\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're going to learn something today,\n\n13\n00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:44.388\nright?\n&gt;&gt; We are, and\n\n14\n00:00:44.388 --> 00:00:48.489\nI am glad that you're with me because\nyou're a good number person and yeah,\n\n15\n00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.651\nI do know a few things about Excel and\nthe terms of numbers, so we are going to,\n\n16\n00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:56.995\nyou know it's funny because I was thinking\nabout, how do I title this episode?\n\n17\n00:00:56.995 --> 00:01:01.488\nCuz we're covering quite a few\ndifferent formats together, and\n\n18\n00:01:01.488 --> 00:01:04.028\nI would say these are pretty common.\n\n19\n00:01:04.028 --> 00:01:07.055\nThey're all numbers as opposed to\nwhen we get into like the text and\n\n20\n00:01:07.055 --> 00:01:09.172\nsome of the special ones and\nthings like that.\n\n21\n00:01:09.172 --> 00:01:11.328\nSo that's what we're gonna go over.\n\n22\n00:01:11.328 --> 00:01:15.515\nWe're gonna do over decimals,\nwe're gonna do currency, fractions.\n\n23\n00:01:15.515 --> 00:01:17.405\nWe got all sorts of fun planned for us.\n\n24\n00:01:17.405 --> 00:01:20.062\nSo why don't we just jump right into it.\n\n25\n00:01:20.062 --> 00:01:24.085\nAnd I have the same workbook that\nwe were working with before.\n\n26\n00:01:24.085 --> 00:01:26.695\nI actually closed it and\nthen reopened it, so\n\n27\n00:01:26.695 --> 00:01:29.137\nit kind of like reset itself a little bit.\n\n28\n00:01:29.137 --> 00:01:33.857\nSo we were on the intro tab first for\nthe,hey,\n\n29\n00:01:33.857 --> 00:01:37.177\nintroduction, and\nnow we're on to numbers, cool.\n\n30\n00:01:37.177 --> 00:01:41.180\nSo I've got some numbers and\nI've pre-entered them.\n\n31\n00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.308\nThey are not pre-formatted.\n\n32\n00:01:43.308 --> 00:01:46.967\nSo if we look these,\nnotice up here, it says General.\n\n33\n00:01:46.967 --> 00:01:51.040\nMoving my cursor down, yep,\nthese are all general.\n\n34\n00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.542\nThe only things that I have down\nhere were just reminders for\n\n35\n00:01:54.542 --> 00:01:56.376\nmyself of how I want to show it.\n\n36\n00:01:56.376 --> 00:02:01.069\nBecause we're gonna take the idea\nof there is information already\n\n37\n00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:06.080\nentered into the cells, and\nwe want to change the way it looks.\n\n38\n00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.330\nAnd then so this is the after the fact.\n\n39\n00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.772\nAnd with numbers, as numbers,\nthat's not too hard, okay?\n\n40\n00:02:15.772 --> 00:02:21.020\nSo if I wanted to format this,\nlet's zoom in a little bit so we can see.\n\n41\n00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.409\nSome have no decimals,\nsome have three, four.\n\n42\n00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.470\nSome are negative, okay?\n\n43\n00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.450\nWe have big, large,\nsmall numbers all the way through here.\n\n44\n00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.795\nSo as general, when I type them in and\nI could keep on typing.\n\n45\n00:02:36.795 --> 00:02:38.240\nThere we go, perfect.\n\n46\n00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.170\nThere's something I typed in,\nit didn't change anything.\n\n47\n00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.430\nBut if I select these cells, and I did\nselect a couple extra blank ones just to\n\n48\n00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.420\nhave it to where we have it now\npre-formatted so when we enter.\n\n49\n00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.210\nI want to change the way this looks.\n\n50\n00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.420\nSo up here, we have our drop-down.\n\n51\n00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.675\nAnd if change this to number, like I\nwant to say hey, treat these as numbers.\n\n52\n00:03:00.675 --> 00:03:02.650\nLets see what that does.\n\n53\n00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.200\nAll right, well, what did it seems to do?\n\n54\n00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.050\nLooks like we now have two decimal places.\n\n55\n00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.320\nIt done our rules of rounding and\nadded decimal places for\n\n56\n00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.420\nwhole numbers, rounded up or\nrounded down for some of these other ones.\n\n57\n00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.530\nI just did an undo so you could see that.\n\n58\n00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.590\nAnd that's what number.\n\n59\n00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.320\nIf I change it to a Number format,\nthat's what's going to happen.\n\n60\n00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.164\nCool.\n\n61\n00:03:25.164 --> 00:03:28.300\nThere are a few other things\nthat you can do up here.\n\n62\n00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.500\nNotice that there's a couple different\nbuttons at the bottom of this drop-down.\n\n63\n00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.386\nThere's a increase decimal,\ndecrease decimal, add a comma,\n\n64\n00:03:38.386 --> 00:03:45.560\nmake them into a percent, or\nchange it into a accounting number format.\n\n65\n00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.590\nSo this some of your quick buttons.\n\n66\n00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.800\nSo I could have if I'm like hey,\nthese are all numbers, but\n\n67\n00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.800\nI really wanna make it to where everybody\nhas two decimal places, I could have just\n\n68\n00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.570\ntaken these buttons and then notice\nhow as soon as I said increase.\n\n69\n00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.360\nIt basically went to, okay well\nwhat was the largest decimal place?\n\n70\n00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.810\nI think we had five, it looks like,\nwas like the fifth decimal place.\n\n71\n00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.696\nAnd so it added five cuz that was like\nthe largest value if you wanna say.\n\n72\n00:04:12.696 --> 00:04:18.310\nSo now if I increase some more,\nit will add them or I can decrease.\n\n73\n00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.966\nSo maybe I only want a single decimal\nplace, so I could have done it and\n\n74\n00:04:21.966 --> 00:04:25.764\nby clicking these buttons at the top,\nlook what it automatically did.\n\n75\n00:04:25.764 --> 00:04:27.388\nIt changed it to a number format.\n\n76\n00:04:27.388 --> 00:04:30.278\nSo it's taking it out of\nthe general format and saying,\n\n77\n00:04:30.278 --> 00:04:32.340\nyou are being treated as a number.\n\n78\n00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.660\nNumbers get decimal places of\nhow many you want them to be.\n\n79\n00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.150\nBut there's also some\nnegative numbers in there.\n\n80\n00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.940\nAnd so I'm gonna put you\non the spot there, Justin.\n\n81\n00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.035\nHe's like gosh what am I doing?\n\n82\n00:04:46.035 --> 00:04:50.298\nHow are some ways that you can display\nnegative numbers in just number world.\n\n83\n00:04:50.298 --> 00:04:52.943\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, the only alternative way that I'm\n\n84\n00:04:52.943 --> 00:04:56.673\nvery familiar with is actually\nhaving parenthesis around them for\n\n85\n00:04:56.673 --> 00:04:57.880\naccounting sheets.\n\n86\n00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.950\nI'm seeing that on an accounting sheet\nwhere just a regular number is there.\n\n87\n00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.080\nIf it's surrounded by parentheses, it's\na negative value and those meant to be\n\n88\n00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.630\nadded or subtracted appropriately.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm just curious,\n\n89\n00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.520\nin your line of work, cuz I know you\ncome from that scientific background.\n\n90\n00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.799\nIf you were displaying negative numbers,\n\n91\n00:05:14.799 --> 00:05:17.910\nis it just common to just put\na negative sign in front of it?\n\n92\n00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.860\nThere's no special way in your engineering\nand everything that you would do that was\n\n93\n00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:23.930\nfor negatives?\n&gt;&gt; For\n\n94\n00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.060\nthe most part we would do negatives,\nor every once in a while we\n\n95\n00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.370\nwould pull a negative one out front and\nmultiply by negative one,\n\n96\n00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.800\nand that way we can manipulate\nthe numbers without the negative signs.\n\n97\n00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.370\nAnd it just made for easier reduction.\n\n98\n00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.840\nThat's a bunch of math tricks,\n\n99\n00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.220\nit not necessarily something\nI would do in an Excel sheet.\n\n100\n00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:44.170\nI would let Excel display the property\neither with a negative sign out front and\n\n101\n00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:48.015\nthen just rely on the fact that\nthat is being used when I would\n\n102\n00:05:48.015 --> 00:05:52.095\ncreate formulas within Excel.\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha, okay, I was just curious.\n\n103\n00:05:52.095 --> 00:05:55.835\nAccounting is the place that I normally\nassociated with the parentheses around\n\n104\n00:05:55.835 --> 00:05:57.315\na negative number.\n\n105\n00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:59.135\nSo that's one of our options.\n\n106\n00:05:59.135 --> 00:06:01.555\nWe're not talking about currency just yet,\nbut\n\n107\n00:06:01.555 --> 00:06:05.770\njust how to display negative numbers\ncuz we're still in the number format.\n\n108\n00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:06.317\nWhat do we get there?\n\n109\n00:06:06.317 --> 00:06:10.000\nWe just go to the more\nnumber formats dialogue box.\n\n110\n00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.620\nWe go to our format cells because\nin the category of number, and\n\n111\n00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.090\nthis is a cool place where you can\nactually start learning a little bit more.\n\n112\n00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.795\nYou look down at the bottom it says,\nnumbers used for\n\n113\n00:06:19.795 --> 00:06:22.823\ngeneral display of numbers,\ncurrency is special [SOUND].\n\n114\n00:06:22.823 --> 00:06:27.835\nOkay, so you can see that,\ndo you want it to use a comma for\n\n115\n00:06:27.835 --> 00:06:31.504\nyour separator of your 1000 digits?\n\n116\n00:06:31.504 --> 00:06:33.340\nHow many decimal places do you want?\n\n117\n00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:34.010\nDo you want two?\n\n118\n00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.740\nDo you want three?\n\n119\n00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.578\nAnd then how do you want your\nnegative numbers to look?\n\n120\n00:06:37.578 --> 00:06:39.472\nIf you're in the red, so\n\n121\n00:06:39.472 --> 00:06:45.440\nif you wanted to use a visual format of\nred numbers are negative, go with that.\n\n122\n00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.200\nMaybe you want it to be in parentheses and\nred.\n\n123\n00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.750\nSo what do I want it to do\nwhen I have negative numbers?\n\n124\n00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.030\nYou can choose that in\nthis More Options button.\n\n125\n00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.840\nSo let's go with three decimal places.\n\n126\n00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:58.843\nWe'll put a comma in there.\n\n127\n00:06:58.843 --> 00:07:02.250\nWe'll do a negative as parentheses and\nred.\n\n128\n00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:05.190\nYou click OK, and then it does that.\n&gt;&gt; Now Bonn,\n\n129\n00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.700\nthis is a very pointed question for you.\n\n130\n00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.660\nComma is a common separator.\n\n131\n00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.880\nComma is a common separator,\nmy goodness, for\n\n132\n00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.660\nkind of the United States and\nvarious other locales.\n\n133\n00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.450\nI know in alternative locales,\nthey'll actually use dots and\n\n134\n00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:25.090\nthen the comma serves\nas the decimal place.\n\n135\n00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:29.960\nIs that dependent on the installation\nregion of Excel or is that just,\n\n136\n00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.960\nyou're going to accept\ncommas as the separator for\n\n137\n00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.600\nthe thousands digits?\n&gt;&gt; Wow,\n\n138\n00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:38.640\nthey really use commas\nas the decimal place?\n\n139\n00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.426\nWow, you could see how US-centric I am.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n140\n00:07:42.426 --> 00:07:46.150\n&gt;&gt; And that may not be very widespread.\n\n141\n00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:46.836\nI have seen it.\n\n142\n00:07:46.836 --> 00:07:49.873\nIt's kind of mind bending and the only\nreason that I remember it is I was like,\n\n143\n00:07:49.873 --> 00:07:51.721\nwow, they messed up\nthis number formatting.\n\n144\n00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:53.625\nDid a little bit of research, and\n\n145\n00:07:53.625 --> 00:07:58.396\nwell, commas are sometimes used as how we\nuse decimal places in the United States.\n\n146\n00:07:58.396 --> 00:08:02.179\nAnd then decimals are used\nas the thousand, millions.\n\n147\n00:08:02.179 --> 00:08:06.330\nBillions separators,\nwhich is kind of mind-bending.\n\n148\n00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.763\nBut it looks like that's not really an\noption based on the installation we have\n\n149\n00:08:09.763 --> 00:08:11.920\nhere.\n&gt;&gt; Well, you say that, and\n\n150\n00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.880\nI think it's a great point because, and\nwe're gonna go onto some other formats.\n\n151\n00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.040\nCuz right in,\nI wanted to say in the dates.\n\n152\n00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.085\nAnd I don't know about\nwith the currency and\n\n153\n00:08:21.085 --> 00:08:23.191\nthe way that it's showing your separators.\n\n154\n00:08:23.191 --> 00:08:27.530\nBut do you see how it also talks\nabout the calendar and the location?\n\n155\n00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:31.360\nAnd if we get into some other,\nthat's one I know with the time and\n\n156\n00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.850\nthe date it does give you\nthe language location.\n\n157\n00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:38.480\nI will tell you,\nsince I never have any reason to go\n\n158\n00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.760\noutside of the United States for\nmy purposes.\n\n159\n00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:46.980\nI can't fully answer that question\nwithout looking up the answer.\n\n160\n00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:50.590\nBut it's something that it could be\n\n161\n00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:56.540\nthe language that you're choosing and\nwhat kind of region.\n\n162\n00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:00.889\nUnfortunately that's something I\ndon't know outside of my good old USA\n\n163\n00:09:00.889 --> 00:09:03.751\nformatting because we have to be so\ndifferent.\n\n164\n00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:05.305\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, didn't mean to put you on\n\n165\n00:09:05.305 --> 00:09:06.500\nthe spot there, Vonne.\n\n166\n00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.870\nI didn't know if this\nwas internal settings.\n\n167\n00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:13.640\nI suspect that you would have to\nchange the language settings either\n\n168\n00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.180\nduring the installation,\npost-installation.\n\n169\n00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.980\nLike say this is a different locale\nsetting where you will have different\n\n170\n00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:19.650\ndefaults.\n\n171\n00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:26.529\nHowever, if you don't have those\navailable, just remember, depending\n\n172\n00:09:26.529 --> 00:09:31.970\non your locale, the comma may actually\nbe what you have seen as the period.\n\n173\n00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:35.700\nAnd then the period is the comma.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n174\n00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.720\n&gt;&gt; There's a whole switcheroo going\n\n175\n00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.850\non there.\n&gt;&gt; As you're talking through this,\n\n176\n00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:44.580\nthe thing is that I can't make\nExcel do it by the installation or\n\n177\n00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.380\nthe version or the language.\n\n178\n00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:51.332\nThere are custom number formats to\nwhere you can force it to where I need,\n\n179\n00:09:51.332 --> 00:09:57.580\nall right, the dots are going to separate\nthis many placeholders and everything.\n\n180\n00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.780\nSo you might have to go\nto custom member formats.\n\n181\n00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:07.900\nBut I would have to oogly googly that\none for sure, but very good question.\n\n182\n00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:11.020\nAnd it does make a difference depending\non where you are in the world.\n\n183\n00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:14.858\nAnd since Excel is used everywhere,\nI would have to check that out.\n\n184\n00:10:14.858 --> 00:10:18.140\nCool, all right, so now you can see\nthat we have our decimal places,\n\n185\n00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.470\nour numbers, that's what we're doing.\n\n186\n00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:24.740\nLet's move on to accounting\nversus currency.\n\n187\n00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:30.310\nThis is one that it's really more of,\nagain, a visual display.\n\n188\n00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:33.680\nWe're gonna do this quickly and\nthen I'll go on to some more details.\n\n189\n00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:38.760\nIf I change this to accounting, all right,\n\n190\n00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.280\nlook at how it treated\nthe negative numbers.\n\n191\n00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.540\nIt put the dollar sign out, it rounded.\n\n192\n00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:46.680\nIt put the commas in there,\ntoo, for the separator values.\n\n193\n00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.150\nSo it did all of that.\n\n194\n00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:51.810\nI'll take this, change it to currency.\n\n195\n00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:57.970\nIt about did the same thing,\nbut what do you see\n\n196\n00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:03.014\nis the difference there, Dustin?\n&gt;&gt; Well, I can see in accounting,\n\n197\n00:11:03.014 --> 00:11:06.973\nthere are a few other edge\ncases where you wanna make sure\n\n198\n00:11:06.973 --> 00:11:11.033\nthat the currency denotation\nis always left justified.\n\n199\n00:11:11.033 --> 00:11:13.220\nAnd then the values are right justified.\n\n200\n00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.320\nAnd there's a few other conventions\nthat are used in accounting\n\n201\n00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.470\nthat are very common.\n\n202\n00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:20.892\nSo this looks like accounting is well,\nwe already started with currency.\n\n203\n00:11:20.892 --> 00:11:25.184\nAnd then we're gonna add a few more things\nthat adhere to a common convention within\n\n204\n00:11:25.184 --> 00:11:29.635\nthe accounting subfield.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah, the left decimal or\n\n205\n00:11:29.635 --> 00:11:33.938\nthe left aligned dollar or\nmonetary symbol, okay?\n\n206\n00:11:33.938 --> 00:11:38.263\nAs opposed to the monetary symbol\nis right next to the number and\n\n207\n00:11:38.263 --> 00:11:40.880\nhow it treats your negative numbers.\n\n208\n00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.880\nSo that's the biggest thing.\n\n209\n00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:49.200\nI tend to like the look of this,\ncuz I get very obsessed with alignment.\n\n210\n00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.880\n[LAUGH] So I prefer this,\nit's still the same numbers.\n\n211\n00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.460\nWe can see,\neven looking up at the formula bar,\n\n212\n00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:58.370\nit still has the four or\nthree decimal places.\n\n213\n00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:01.570\nAnd I know there was a couple other\nones that had maybe a few more,\n\n214\n00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:03.090\nthere's one with four decimal places.\n\n215\n00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:05.600\nSo it's still the underlying\ndata that we've talked about,\n\n216\n00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.890\nit just changes how we look at it.\n\n217\n00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:13.380\nSo you can choose which one you want\nto use for your display purposes.\n\n218\n00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:15.580\nAnd just like the numbers,\nI think you get the idea.\n\n219\n00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:20.766\nThat if I took this and\nthen went into the more number formats,\n\n220\n00:12:20.766 --> 00:12:25.010\nI can come into the currency or\nthe accounting.\n\n221\n00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:27.340\nAnd notice how do I want to\ntreat the different numbers?\n\n222\n00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.280\nAccounting just does it, okay?\n\n223\n00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.730\nAnd then the biggest thing would be,\nall right, well,\n\n224\n00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:33.590\nwhat symbol do you want it to be?\n\n225\n00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:36.600\nDo you want it to be in US dollars, okay?\n\n226\n00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.320\nAnd there's a lot of them in here, I'm not\ngonna go through every single one of them.\n\n227\n00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:44.937\nAnd the other thing is,\nwhen I have it selected on this drop-down,\n\n228\n00:12:44.937 --> 00:12:49.070\nwe have the euros, the English pound,\nand the Chinese yen.\n\n229\n00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:53.240\nThose are common formats.\n\n230\n00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:57.130\nSo if I change this to euro,\ndid I just change and\n\n231\n00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:59.450\nconvert that as, what is the US?\n\n232\n00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:02.230\nNo, not doing any conversions or\n\n233\n00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:07.260\ncurrency values.\n&gt;&gt; You're\n\n234\n00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.430\nnot looking up exchange rates.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n235\n00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:11.780\n&gt;&gt; You're not saying, well,\n\n236\n00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:13.500\none British pound is $1.5.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n237\n00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.806\n&gt;&gt; Because those are ever-changing based\n\n238\n00:13:15.806 --> 00:13:17.690\non currency markets.\n\n239\n00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:20.731\nI think that's outside the scope of Excel,\n\n240\n00:13:20.731 --> 00:13:24.646\nthat's kinda your job, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I couldn't remember\n\n241\n00:13:24.646 --> 00:13:27.950\nexchange rate, I'm like the currency\ntranslator thing [LAUGH].\n\n242\n00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:29.940\nThank you for exchange rate, yeah.\n\n243\n00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.320\nNow I mean, I'm going way ahead.\n\n244\n00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.840\nYou can pull external data into Excel.\n\n245\n00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.830\nAnd then you can put that into it and\nuse that as your formula, and\n\n246\n00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:38.860\nit can always be changing.\n\n247\n00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:44.310\nYou can do all that, but\nthat's a totally different area of Excel.\n\n248\n00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:48.773\nHere it's just changing the symbol that's\nin front of it, that's all it's doing.\n\n249\n00:13:48.773 --> 00:13:51.780\nIt's not doing your exchange rate,\nso good to know.\n\n250\n00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:54.590\nAnd that's what we can do\nwith changing the symbol in\n\n251\n00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:55.800\nthe front.\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne,\n\n252\n00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.185\nI actually have a recommendation.\n\n253\n00:13:57.185 --> 00:14:01.582\nIf you're printing this out or\nyou're sending this to someone and\n\n254\n00:14:01.582 --> 00:14:06.135\nmaybe they're running their finger\ndown a column to see expenses and\n\n255\n00:14:06.135 --> 00:14:08.585\nrevenue or anything of that nature.\n\n256\n00:14:08.585 --> 00:14:10.375\nMaybe it's a small business.\n\n257\n00:14:10.375 --> 00:14:13.515\nI highly recommend, even if you are not\nfamiliar with it, familiarize yourself\n\n258\n00:14:13.515 --> 00:14:18.980\nwith the accounting conventions, because\nthat dollar sign kind of nestled up?\n\n259\n00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:21.540\nYou're like, that doesn't mean anything.\n\n260\n00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:22.680\nBut notice that thousand,\n\n261\n00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:26.660\nthere's actually a negative in front of\nthe dollar sign, you might miss that.\n\n262\n00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:29.510\nIn addition to,\nthat dollar sign can sometimes,\n\n263\n00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:31.950\nat a quick glance, look like a five.\n\n264\n00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:33.870\nSo be very careful.\n\n265\n00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:41.110\nBy removing those to the left, you've kind\nof separated the currency information and\n\n266\n00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:45.820\nthe relative value of the currency.\n&gt;&gt; That's a really good observation.\n\n267\n00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:47.590\nI know you have a little\nexperience with this too, but\n\n268\n00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:50.040\nI was just like, you're right.\n\n269\n00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:55.719\nThe negative sign is outside of the dollar\nsign and it does look like a 5 [LAUGH].\n\n270\n00:14:55.719 --> 00:14:59.970\nPretty cool, so maybe we should just stick\nwith accounting and go with US dollars.\n\n271\n00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:04.980\nSo because, again,\nI'm just a US-centric person.\n\n272\n00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:07.470\nUnfortunately, I don't know if\nit's fortunate or unfortunate,\n\n273\n00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:08.510\nbut you know what?\n\n274\n00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:09.990\nThat's a totally different subject matter.\n\n275\n00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:13.870\nSo we're gonna go ahead and just see\nthat once I have things preformatted,\n\n276\n00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:18.470\nit will go ahead and, as I enter it,\nit will change the display.\n\n277\n00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:21.985\nOkay, let's move on to percentages.\n\n278\n00:15:21.985 --> 00:15:23.450\nOoh, this is a fun one.\n\n279\n00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:28.400\nSo these are not, okay,\nI know that this is going to be 50%,\n\n280\n00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.890\nthis is gonna be 25 because it\nalready has the decimal places.\n\n281\n00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:34.630\nThere is a button right here for\npercentage style.\n\n282\n00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:38.330\nAnd it just converts it into percents,\nokay?\n\n283\n00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.960\nAnd I think that math looks about right,\nyeah?\n\n284\n00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.920\nOkay, they went ahead and converted it.\n\n285\n00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.400\nLet's just go into this for a minute.\n\n286\n00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:49.728\nBecause if I go into the more formats,\nit's just saying percentage formats\n\n287\n00:15:49.728 --> 00:15:54.613\nmultiplies the cell value by 100, displays\nthe result with a percentage symbol.\n\n288\n00:15:54.613 --> 00:15:57.982\nAnd of course you can increase\nthe decimal places if you would like.\n\n289\n00:15:57.982 --> 00:16:00.992\nOkay, so on that one, not too bad.\n\n290\n00:16:00.992 --> 00:16:02.265\nIf I take these.\n\n291\n00:16:02.265 --> 00:16:04.140\nOkay, so let's just look at this.\n\n292\n00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:07.690\nOkay, 123.789.\n\n293\n00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:12.696\nJust so look at these numbers for\na minute, right?\n\n294\n00:16:12.696 --> 00:16:17.380\n15.7, if I, 1234, when I take this and\n\n295\n00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:22.650\nI turn it into percentage,\nso that's, what is that?\n\n296\n00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:29.150\n123,000% [LAUGH] I mean, all right,\ncuz that's exactly what the format does.\n\n297\n00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:33.130\nSo when you have decimal\nplaces versus like numbers,\n\n298\n00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:38.020\nis this a percentage of increase\nin our sales or what have you?\n\n299\n00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:42.409\nThat's a really good- [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Unless it's the increase in\n\n300\n00:16:42.409 --> 00:16:43.036\nyour debt-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n301\n00:16:43.036 --> 00:16:45.154\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's a good number to have for\n\n302\n00:16:45.154 --> 00:16:48.350\nanything businesswise.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so just be careful about like\n\n303\n00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:52.460\nI have all these numbers and\nI'm just gonna throw the into a percent.\n\n304\n00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:58.160\nIt might not always give you\nthe correct data, if you wanna say.\n\n305\n00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.040\nIt's doing what told it to,\nit's gonna times it by 100 and\n\n306\n00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.010\nput the percent sign on it.\n\n307\n00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:06.280\nOkay, so just something to think about.\n\n308\n00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.210\nSo if I take these and\nput these into percentage.\n\n309\n00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:10.330\nSo I preformatted it.\n\n310\n00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:16.227\nIf I do 0.125, that's 13%,\nit was actually 12.5, right?\n\n311\n00:17:16.227 --> 00:17:16.963\nYeah?\nOkay.\n\n312\n00:17:16.963 --> 00:17:19.220\n[LAUGH] So it's doing the rounding.\n\n313\n00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:21.470\nBut now if that is 12.5,\n\n314\n00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:26.190\nlook at how I can increase the decimal\nplaces, and it does show that.\n\n315\n00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:27.790\nBecause that's what it is.\n\n316\n00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:32.170\nBut if I typed in 13, it's 13.\n\n317\n00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:38.540\nIf I increase the decimal places on it,\nits still the raw data of 13.\n\n318\n00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:42.275\nIf I typed in 130, it's a 130%.\n\n319\n00:17:42.275 --> 00:17:47.018\nSo you just to kind of, 13 is the same,\nso do you see how it's not,\n\n320\n00:17:47.018 --> 00:17:50.150\nI don't know how to explain this.\n&gt;&gt; It's not consistent in\n\n321\n00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.888\nits behavior.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n322\n00:17:50.888 --> 00:17:51.770\n&gt;&gt; If it's preformatted,\n\n323\n00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:54.180\nthen a whole number becomes\nthat percentage amount,\n\n324\n00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:55.990\nwhich is actually a decimal.\n\n325\n00:17:55.990 --> 00:18:00.440\nIf it's already existing,\nit assumes that you mean to take 1234 and\n\n326\n00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:04.850\nmake it a percentage,\nwhich means multiply it by 100.\n\n327\n00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:09.678\nAnd there it's just 1234%,\nstill a great return on investment.\n\n328\n00:18:09.678 --> 00:18:10.619\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n329\n00:18:10.619 --> 00:18:13.581\n&gt;&gt; But the other one is is a 123,400%,\n\n330\n00:18:13.581 --> 00:18:16.330\nwhich is significantly different.\n\n331\n00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:18.218\nBut that begs the question.\n\n332\n00:18:18.218 --> 00:18:21.257\nIf it's preformatted,\nwe typed in 12 or 13, and\n\n333\n00:18:21.257 --> 00:18:25.048\nyou change it back to general number,\ndoes it make it up 0.13?\n\n334\n00:18:25.048 --> 00:18:26.889\nOr does it keep it as 13?\n\n335\n00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.945\nThat puts them all as decimals.\n&gt;&gt; See, that's tricky.\n\n336\n00:18:31.945 --> 00:18:32.530\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n337\n00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:33.364\n&gt;&gt; That's tricky,\n\n338\n00:18:33.364 --> 00:18:35.870\nyou're definitely gonna have\nto keep an eye on that.\n\n339\n00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:38.477\n&gt;&gt; I think this goes back to understanding\n\n340\n00:18:38.477 --> 00:18:41.321\nwhat you are supposed\nto be doing in Excel.\n\n341\n00:18:41.321 --> 00:18:46.622\nMeaning like hey,\nwe are measuring percentage rates,\n\n342\n00:18:46.622 --> 00:18:51.019\nso you need to know if it's preformatted,\nand\n\n343\n00:18:51.019 --> 00:18:55.210\nI have to type it in as 0.25 or 0.15.\n\n344\n00:18:55.210 --> 00:19:01.448\nCuz 15 and 0.1, well I guess that's the\nsame thing, but you know what I'm saying.\n\n345\n00:19:01.448 --> 00:19:03.240\nI don't exactly know how to explain it.\n\n346\n00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:07.950\nI think the inconsistency, and\nit's not doing it all the same.\n\n347\n00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:08.920\nI don't know how to say it.\n\n348\n00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.300\nYou gotta be careful, okay?\n\n349\n00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.660\nYou gotta watch it.\n&gt;&gt; You have be careful because depending\n\n350\n00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:17.030\non whether it's preformatted or formatted\npost of entering the values, you're gonna\n\n351\n00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:21.320\nhave different behaviors based on if\nthe member is higher than one, right?\n\n352\n00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:25.720\nSo all percentages are,\nthat's what percent means,\n\n353\n00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:29.936\nper 100, or per 100th,\nhowever you want to.\n\n354\n00:19:29.936 --> 00:19:31.978\nSo 0.71 is 71%.\n\n355\n00:19:31.978 --> 00:19:35.974\nWell, if it was preformatted, and\nyou type in 0.71, that'll give you 71%.\n\n356\n00:19:35.974 --> 00:19:39.439\nIf you type in 71,\nthat still gives you 71%.\n\n357\n00:19:39.439 --> 00:19:46.652\nBut if it was already there,\none is 7100% and the other one is 71%.\n\n358\n00:19:46.652 --> 00:19:49.750\nSo yeah, man.\n&gt;&gt; It feels like you start talking-\n\n359\n00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:50.281\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah\n\n360\n00:19:50.281 --> 00:19:51.179\n&gt;&gt; In these weird loops.\n\n361\n00:19:51.179 --> 00:19:53.930\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You getting, it's getting weird.\n\n362\n00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:57.140\nBut this actually illustrates the things\nthat you would encounter, right?\n\n363\n00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:00.903\nWhere you're like, wait a minute,\nwe're $45 billion company.\n\n364\n00:20:00.903 --> 00:20:01.556\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n365\n00:20:01.556 --> 00:20:02.813\n&gt;&gt; I don't know what happen there.\n\n366\n00:20:02.813 --> 00:20:07.596\nAnd that's because well, you applied\na percentage, and then it changed things.\n\n367\n00:20:07.596 --> 00:20:10.670\nUnderlying data may not have changed.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.\n\n368\n00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:12.285\n&gt;&gt; Actually, it hasn't changed,\n\n369\n00:20:12.285 --> 00:20:14.430\nnot may not have, but the representation.\n\n370\n00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:18.020\nThis would be horrible to send\nout to like an investors list.\n\n371\n00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:22.230\nThey'd be like yeah,\n123,400% increase in revenue?\n\n372\n00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:23.414\nNah, that's not right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n373\n00:20:23.414 --> 00:20:24.973\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's on me,\n\n374\n00:20:24.973 --> 00:20:26.060\nsorry.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n375\n00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:28.010\n&gt;&gt; Excel spreadsheets format weird.\n\n376\n00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:29.310\n&gt;&gt; Well, and this is also where some\n\n377\n00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:36.590\npeople can argue that\nusing a true database,\n\n378\n00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:41.030\nlike if you use Access, and\nhow you can put on input masks, and\n\n379\n00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:45.080\nyou can really control how your\ndata is typed in and entered.\n\n380\n00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:49.360\nYou have data validation and everything in\nExcel, but it takes it to another level.\n\n381\n00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.726\nSo yes, very important to\nunderstand what you're doing.\n\n382\n00:20:51.726 --> 00:20:54.969\nLet's talk about the last two that\nwe're gonna go over, fractions and\n\n383\n00:20:54.969 --> 00:20:56.620\nscientific notation.\n\n384\n00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:01.460\nFractions, it's the same concept\nwhat we've been talking about.\n\n385\n00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:04.810\nI can take this put this into a fraction,\nand\n\n386\n00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:08.320\nthings like 0.5, 0.25,\nokay, that's not too bad.\n\n387\n00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.500\nBut then it gets into these weird,\nand Justin's got the, just so\n\n388\n00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.550\nyou can look at the numbers again, right?\n\n389\n00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:15.060\nSo here are the numbers.\n\n390\n00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:18.110\nAnd then we change it into a fraction.\n\n391\n00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:23.454\nSee how it's just doing that\nweird behavior of okay,\n\n392\n00:21:23.454 --> 00:21:30.003\nso now I've changed this, and\nif I type in 1.25 that is an 8.\n\n393\n00:21:30.003 --> 00:21:31.471\nAnd that's not too bad.\n\n394\n00:21:31.471 --> 00:21:38.130\nBut if I typed in 12.567,\nthen it's getting some stuff there.\n\n395\n00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.750\nAnd again, how is it breaking down?\n\n396\n00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:46.300\nIf we select all of these, and go to\nthe fraction, the more number of formats.\n\n397\n00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.770\nDo we want it to go up to three digits,\n\n398\n00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:52.085\ndo we want it in quarters or\neighths or tenths?\n\n399\n00:21:52.085 --> 00:21:55.438\nWhere's our dividing line?\n\n400\n00:21:55.438 --> 00:21:57.120\n[LAUGH] Dividing line.\n\n401\n00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:03.781\nSo if I said up to three digits,\nokay, now I've that, 299/500.\n\n402\n00:22:03.781 --> 00:22:10.529\n[LAUGH] I think it's a little too much for\nme.\n\n403\n00:22:10.529 --> 00:22:13.057\nYeah, thank you, you can read the numbers.\n\n404\n00:22:13.057 --> 00:22:15.096\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n405\n00:22:15.096 --> 00:22:17.133\n&gt;&gt; Told you, that fifth grade math test,\n\n406\n00:22:17.133 --> 00:22:18.876\nI probably wouldn't do so well.\n\n407\n00:22:18.876 --> 00:22:21.590\nSo yeah, you gotta be careful\nwith all of this stuff,\n\n408\n00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:23.710\nit's just how we're going to display it.\n\n409\n00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:27.390\nAnd this is where sometimes people just\ngo ahead and say, I don't need all this,\n\n410\n00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:33.185\nI'm just going to go straight to text so\nI can type in 5/7 or 5/8.\n\n411\n00:22:33.185 --> 00:22:33.985\nThose types of things.\n\n412\n00:22:33.985 --> 00:22:35.065\nDon't do the conversion for\n\n413\n00:22:35.065 --> 00:22:38.045\nme, I need to enter it in just as that.\n&gt;&gt; Now, Vonne, I have a question about\n\n414\n00:22:38.045 --> 00:22:41.365\nthese fractions because technically,\nthese are mixed numbers.\n\n415\n00:22:41.365 --> 00:22:44.124\nLike the last one, one, two,\nthree or the second to last one.\n\n416\n00:22:44.124 --> 00:22:46.526\nOne, two, three, four and then nothing.\n\n417\n00:22:46.526 --> 00:22:49.994\nWell, it's because 1234 holes and\n\n418\n00:22:49.994 --> 00:22:55.140\nno fractional component.\n&gt;&gt; I'm not a big fan of mixed numbers,\n\n419\n00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:56.610\nyou learn them about fifth grade,\n\n420\n00:22:56.610 --> 00:23:00.870\nand you learn later on to never use them\nbecause they're hard to reason about.\n\n421\n00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:03.400\nIs there anyway to where I can\nmake these improper fractions,\n\n422\n00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.530\nwhere I do not have a whole number amount?\n\n423\n00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:11.369\nAnd Vonne's giving me the sideways glance\noff camera, like what are you saying?\n\n424\n00:23:11.369 --> 00:23:14.863\nInstead of like 15 and\n7/10, I want a 157/10.\n\n425\n00:23:14.863 --> 00:23:19.634\nIs there any way to do that?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I think that's where I would\n\n426\n00:23:19.634 --> 00:23:24.532\nprobably just, so you want to have,\nI'm gonna put this into text first,\n\n427\n00:23:24.532 --> 00:23:27.776\nwe're going a little ahead,\nbut that's okay.\n\n428\n00:23:27.776 --> 00:23:29.290\nI want 157 over-\n&gt;&gt; 10.\n\n429\n00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:30.060\n&gt;&gt; 10, like that.\n\n430\n00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:40.480\nSo I would probably, for me, treat it\nas a text, so if I enter it in as that,\n\n431\n00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:46.388\nI don't know if I can get the number\nformat in the fraction to do that.\n\n432\n00:23:46.388 --> 00:23:48.738\nI mean, cuz you saw the options in here,\n\n433\n00:23:48.738 --> 00:23:51.793\nI'm not sure as I turn it\ninto an improper fraction.\n\n434\n00:23:51.793 --> 00:23:54.855\nI mean this, I don't think it has that.\n\n435\n00:23:54.855 --> 00:24:00.252\nSo, I think this is where knowing\nthe rules of math That you do know,\n\n436\n00:24:00.252 --> 00:24:03.985\nso you're already testing\nmy limits on text.\n\n437\n00:24:03.985 --> 00:24:05.880\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, full disclosure, Vonne,\n\n438\n00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.212\nmost people will not use it, all right?\n\n439\n00:24:07.212 --> 00:24:10.860\nA lot of times, you're not gonna see\nimproper fractions or mixed numbers.\n\n440\n00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:12.670\nYou'll see decimals.\n\n441\n00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:17.225\nAnd unless you have very specific use\ncase where I wanna show that this is\n\n442\n00:24:17.225 --> 00:24:21.310\nfour-sevenths of this, and it just\nmakes it easier to reason about cuz\n\n443\n00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:25.120\na seventh is like 0.14 or\nsome crazy thing like that.\n\n444\n00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:27.530\nSo it just makes it easier\nto reason about sometimes.\n\n445\n00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:31.830\nBut if it's a mixed number like this,\nI argue that that's actually harder to\n\n446\n00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:34.735\nreason about than decimals.\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go with what you just said.\n\n447\n00:24:34.735 --> 00:24:38.190\n[LAUGH] Now the thing is when\nyou're taking it into a number.\n\n448\n00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:39.560\nSo let's look at this.\n\n449\n00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:41.730\nLook at some of your numbers,\nand you can check the math.\n\n450\n00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:48.930\nIf I switch this into a number, it's not\ndoing the math for you, necessarily.\n\n451\n00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:52.930\nSome of them, I can tell,\nyeah, that works.\n\n452\n00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:54.360\nOkay.\nBut I don't know the rest of them.\n\n453\n00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.870\nI would need you to verify.\n\n454\n00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:57.810\nIs it actually changing it into a decimal?\n\n455\n00:24:57.810 --> 00:24:58.320\nNot?\n\n456\n00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:58.917\nIt is?\nOkay.\n\n457\n00:24:58.917 --> 00:25:00.370\nSo these are right?\n\n458\n00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:01.450\nOkay.\nThen they are right.\n\n459\n00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:03.823\nSo maybe it can do some of your math for\nyou.\n\n460\n00:25:03.823 --> 00:25:05.510\n[LAUGH] Okay.\n\n461\n00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:07.130\nSo my last one.\n\n462\n00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:08.460\nIt's always so much fun.\n\n463\n00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:10.705\nScientific notation.\n\n464\n00:25:10.705 --> 00:25:14.825\nThe whole 1E23 that we're doing.\n\n465\n00:25:14.825 --> 00:25:18.080\nYou know about this, right?\n\n466\n00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:20.037\nI had to remind myself, and\n\n467\n00:25:20.037 --> 00:25:24.886\nI actually had to go out to some\nwebsites to remind myself, okay, so\n\n468\n00:25:24.886 --> 00:25:30.843\nwhat is it actually doing replacing part\nof the number with E+n, where E stands for\n\n469\n00:25:30.843 --> 00:25:36.066\nexponent, multiplies the preceding\nnumber by to 10 to the nth power?\n\n470\n00:25:36.066 --> 00:25:41.577\nSo, for example,\na 2-decimal scientific format\n\n471\n00:25:41.577 --> 00:25:46.972\ndisplays this big old number as 1.23 E+10.\n\n472\n00:25:46.972 --> 00:25:49.340\nSo it's 1.23 times 10 to the 10th power.\n\n473\n00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:52.740\nOkay.\n\n474\n00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:53.337\nSounds good.\n\n475\n00:25:53.337 --> 00:25:56.722\nI also went over to a mathisfun, right?\n\n476\n00:25:56.722 --> 00:25:59.120\nSo mathisfun.com.\n\n477\n00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:02.880\nAnd then, this is also known as\nstandard form, which I'm like,\n\n478\n00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.040\nthat sounds somewhat familiar.\n\n479\n00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.345\nAnd I mean,\nI remember doing this stuff in school.\n\n480\n00:26:07.345 --> 00:26:09.310\nIt's been a long time.\n\n481\n00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:13.480\nBut you can see that it's just giving me\na little bit different breakdown of how\n\n482\n00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:18.210\nit's going to do this and\nwhat scientific notation is.\n\n483\n00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:22.630\nThe biggest thing for me is that I don't\nwant it to do a scientific notation.\n\n484\n00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:29.370\nI want it just display 1E23 because\nI need that as my section number.\n\n485\n00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:35.860\nSo it's just going to show very\nlarge numbers with an exponent.\n\n486\n00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:40.440\nNow, if I've had pre-formatted\nthis to be in scientific notation,\n\n487\n00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:45.290\nif I typed in a big,\nlong number, then it does that.\n\n488\n00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:49.710\nIf I type in 12, it does that too.\n\n489\n00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:52.580\nAnd then if I type in 120,\nit does that too.\n\n490\n00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:57.680\nSo you can see what it's doing\nof how it's displaying it.\n\n491\n00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:01.270\nAnd then if I switch this back,\nthen it's gonna go ahead and\n\n492\n00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:04.200\nshow me that that is what I typed in.\n\n493\n00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.500\nSo?\n&gt;&gt; I do have a question about this, Vonne.\n\n494\n00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:10.817\nWhat if I type in a super small number\nlike 0.00000, like nine 0s and a 1,\n\n495\n00:27:10.817 --> 00:27:14.994\nand it's scientific notation formatted?\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so what did you want me to do?\n\n496\n00:27:14.994 --> 00:27:15.494\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n497\n00:27:15.494 --> 00:27:17.001\nSo in a scientific notation formatted\n\n498\n00:27:17.001 --> 00:27:21.570\ncell, what if I type 0., and\nthen just kinda 000000000,\n\n499\n00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:23.748\njust add a bunch of 0s, and\nthen type your favorite number?\n\n500\n00:27:23.748 --> 00:27:24.736\nHit enter.\n\n501\n00:27:24.736 --> 00:27:26.261\n[SOUND] All right, there you go.\n\n502\n00:27:26.261 --> 00:27:30.083\nSo scientific notation also allows you to\n\n503\n00:27:30.083 --> 00:27:34.820\nrepresent small numbers\nin a common format.\n\n504\n00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:38.510\nI can tell you Vonne hates this,\nbut from my perspective,\n\n505\n00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:43.040\nif you're taking measurements that\nmaybe very small measurements, and\n\n506\n00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:47.130\nyou want to compare what are called\nthe orders of magnitude, all right?\n\n507\n00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:52.720\nSo you have E8, E8, E8, and then there's\nan E10, and you're like, hold on a second.\n\n508\n00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:57.756\nThat gives me a quick glance to say those\nare a hundred times larger than the other\n\n509\n00:27:57.756 --> 00:28:03.320\nones, so it can give you a different kind\nof viewpoint for the respective data.\n\n510\n00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:05.785\nThat's another insightful insight.\n\n511\n00:28:05.785 --> 00:28:08.291\n[LAUGH] Have you used this?\n\n512\n00:28:08.291 --> 00:28:12.444\nYeah, so you've done this with your\nresearch and everything, so you've had to\n\n513\n00:28:12.444 --> 00:28:15.210\ndo it represented this way in Excel?\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n514\n00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:18.170\nI've done it in Excel and\nvarious other formats.\n\n515\n00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:21.730\nSo very small numbers that\nhave lots of preceding zeros?\n\n516\n00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:22.538\nGreat to use.\n\n517\n00:28:22.538 --> 00:28:27.818\nVery large numbers that have one, two,\nthree, and then a bunch of post zeroes,\n\n518\n00:28:27.818 --> 00:28:32.635\nscientific notation is very helpful\nbecause it allows you to compare what\n\n519\n00:28:32.635 --> 00:28:37.160\nare called orders of magnitude in\nmy field, which are powers of ten.\n\n520\n00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.620\nWhat are the respective powers of ten?\n\n521\n00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:43.390\nEvery time that number changes,\nthen that means you're different by and\n\n522\n00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:45.060\nmultiplied factor of 10.\n\n523\n00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:48.263\nSo E8 and\nE10 are a hundred times different.\n\n524\n00:28:48.263 --> 00:28:49.870\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n525\n00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:51.260\nSee?\nAnd this is why you get two different\n\n526\n00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:52.240\nperspectives.\n\n527\n00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:56.168\nSomebody who can do some Excel stuff, and\nsomeone who really knows a lot about math,\n\n528\n00:28:56.168 --> 00:28:58.728\nand someone that doesn't\n[INAUDIBLE] know much at all.\n\n529\n00:28:58.728 --> 00:29:02.224\n[LAUGH] But that's great,\nI mean all these things,\n\n530\n00:29:02.224 --> 00:29:07.522\nthese little kind of gotchas in Excel\nthat will get you and understanding it.\n\n531\n00:29:07.522 --> 00:29:12.515\nAnd so having the perspective of\nknowing what you're supposed to\n\n532\n00:29:12.515 --> 00:29:16.961\nbe documenting,\nwhy am I keeping track of these numbers,\n\n533\n00:29:16.961 --> 00:29:22.153\nhow far do I need to go, how scientific or\nhow basic I need this to be.\n\n534\n00:29:22.153 --> 00:29:27.178\nBut understanding what it does and\nbeing careful about it, because of course,\n\n535\n00:29:27.178 --> 00:29:31.978\nyou never want to misrepresent your\nnumbers and misrepresent your data, so\n\n536\n00:29:31.978 --> 00:29:36.328\nthis is a big factor in making sure\nthat it is formatted properly, and\n\n537\n00:29:36.328 --> 00:29:39.290\nit is saying what you want it to say.\n\n538\n00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:41.140\nWhew.\nIt can be a little challenging.\n\n539\n00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:43.190\nAnd it's kinda downright scary,\n\n540\n00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:48.160\nsometimes [LAUGH] about how somebody could\nkinda mess this up for you pretty easily.\n\n541\n00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:51.920\nSo now you know, you have a little bit\nmore information under your belt and\n\n542\n00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.000\nyou'll be that much wiser.\n\n543\n00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.200\nWell, Vonne thank you so much.\n\n544\n00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.590\nWe're just now starting to\nget deep into the weed, but\n\n545\n00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:01.270\nI know we have a lot more jungle\nto traverse in this mini series.\n\n546\n00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:04.180\nSo definitely join us back, but for now,\nwe're gonna go ahead and get out of here.\n\n547\n00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:07.200\nSo signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n548\n00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:07.980\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n549\n00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:09.872\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n550\n00:30:09.872 --> 00:30:15.452\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.827 --> 00:00:17.754\nI am your host Justin Dennison, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.754 --> 00:00:21.320\nwe're continuing on Excel\n2016 essentials for Mac.\n\n5\n00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.730\nWell, we're really diving into\nthe weeds with these number formats.\n\n6\n00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.510\nIt's got me excited and giddy, and\nhopefully it does you as well.\n\n7\n00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.490\nAnd well, we have someone else in\nthe studio who's giddy about this.\n\n8\n00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:31.930\nThe one, the only, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.935\nHow you doing today, Vonne?\n&gt;&gt; I'm feeling giddy [LAUGH].\n\n10\n00:00:34.935 --> 00:00:35.457\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n11\n00:00:35.457 --> 00:00:35.987\n&gt;&gt; But I am, yes.\n\n12\n00:00:35.987 --> 00:00:39.310\nI mean, number formats, we're going\nthrough all the different places today.\n\n13\n00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.970\nWe're in the jungle right now,\nor we're getting through it.\n\n14\n00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.350\nWe got our machete, and\nwe're just hacking away at it.\n\n15\n00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.040\nThey said, I think that's what\nyou're doing in the jungle.\n\n16\n00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.590\nI try not to,\nbecause I would be very scared.\n\n17\n00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:57.350\nSo, we're gonna get into text special and\ncustom in this episode.\n\n18\n00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.336\nSome other examples and\nother number formats.\n\n19\n00:01:00.336 --> 00:01:03.235\n[INAUDIBLE] Number formats,\nwe're talking about text.\n\n20\n00:01:03.235 --> 00:01:09.652\nWell, hopefully you've already maybe\nseen some examples as we've gone through\n\n21\n00:01:09.652 --> 00:01:15.605\nhere as you might want to make your text\nor make your cells formatted as text.\n\n22\n00:01:15.605 --> 00:01:20.525\nSo it doesn't do some of the weird\nthings that it does automatically.\n\n23\n00:01:20.525 --> 00:01:22.962\nJustin threw me for\na loop in the last episode.\n\n24\n00:01:22.962 --> 00:01:25.459\nIt was like, hey, can you change\nthat to an improper fraction?\n\n25\n00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:29.278\nI went,\nI don't know what an improper fraction is.\n\n26\n00:01:29.278 --> 00:01:31.580\nAs soon as you explained it to me,\nI remembered.\n\n27\n00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.071\nAnd I was like, no.\n\n28\n00:01:35.071 --> 00:01:37.760\nBut we did do that little\nexample really quickly.\n\n29\n00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.610\nI'm like, let me change this to text.\n\n30\n00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.849\nSo I have it actually\nright here in front of me.\n\n31\n00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:45.260\n157 over 10 and that's where it's like,\nyep, I want it to look like that.\n\n32\n00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.853\nAnd then we talked about probably wouldn't\never want to put it as an improper\n\n33\n00:01:49.853 --> 00:01:51.665\nfraction but you never know.\n\n34\n00:01:51.665 --> 00:01:53.120\nYou never know if you need to.\n\n35\n00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.370\nSo I had to format that to be text and\nthen it seemed to like that and\n\n36\n00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.854\nit didn't want to do some weird stuff and\neverything.\n\n37\n00:02:02.854 --> 00:02:08.015\nThe other thing that we talked\nabout was the scientific notation.\n\n38\n00:02:08.015 --> 00:02:14.446\nThe whole I wanna section\nnumber is that 1E23 or 24.\n\n39\n00:02:14.446 --> 00:02:17.631\nAnd it's going to always do that,\nand I can't see in that,\n\n40\n00:02:17.631 --> 00:02:20.065\nbecause I need it to say\nexactly what that is.\n\n41\n00:02:20.065 --> 00:02:25.334\nSo, I have certain reasons\nwhy I need to format things\n\n42\n00:02:25.334 --> 00:02:31.300\nas text to get around Excel's\nhelpfulness to my numbers.\n\n43\n00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.050\nSo, I have a worksheet on our\nworkbook here that's called text,\n\n44\n00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.620\nand one of the biggest reasons that\nI format things as text is for\n\n45\n00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.530\nthese two things right here.\n\n46\n00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.980\nTo show preceding zeros and\nto avoid scientific notation.\n\n47\n00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.840\nThat is my biggest reason as\nto why I format cells as text.\n\n48\n00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.720\nSo that's gonna be the biggest one.\n\n49\n00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.459\nSo let's come over here for some examples.\n\n50\n00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:04.500\nWe've talked about it if I type in Vonne\nSmith and Justin Dennis, two ns, right?\n\n51\n00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.504\nOkay, great.\nSo I was like,\n\n52\n00:03:05.504 --> 00:03:08.566\nI've introduced your name like so\nmany times and then I'm like, wait,\n\n53\n00:03:08.566 --> 00:03:09.730\ndoes that how you spell it?\n\n54\n00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.330\nDo I need to change that to text?\n\n55\n00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.970\nDo I really need to say,\nthis has to be treated as text?\n\n56\n00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:16.880\nNot really.\n\n57\n00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.328\nNot for a lot of your values.\n\n58\n00:03:19.328 --> 00:03:20.814\nIt's just not necessary.\n\n59\n00:03:20.814 --> 00:03:24.551\nIf I had a whole column of cities and\nstates,\n\n60\n00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:28.088\nI'm not going to go through the trouble,\n\n61\n00:03:28.088 --> 00:03:32.547\nfor lack of better terms,\nto say you have to be text.\n\n62\n00:03:32.547 --> 00:03:36.354\nBut zip codes,\nthat's something I might go ahead and\n\n63\n00:03:36.354 --> 00:03:41.780\nformat as text preceding zeros this\nis another big one with Excel.\n\n64\n00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.033\nIf I typed in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,\nthose are all numbers, right?\n\n65\n00:03:47.033 --> 00:03:50.113\nEnter, zero's a number, right?\n\n66\n00:03:50.113 --> 00:03:54.571\n[LAUGH] is a number.\n\n67\n00:03:54.571 --> 00:03:59.404\n0,1,2,3,4 00012, really,\n\n68\n00:03:59.404 --> 00:04:04.873\nit does this,\nit will drop your preceding zeroes,\n\n69\n00:04:04.873 --> 00:04:10.212\njust the way Excel works and\nit is not fun sometimes\n\n70\n00:04:10.212 --> 00:04:16.205\nif you need to have zeroes in\nfront of any of your values.\n\n71\n00:04:16.205 --> 00:04:20.691\nBut if I change this to text and\n\n72\n00:04:20.691 --> 00:04:27.696\nthen I type in 00012, it does it, okay?\n\n73\n00:04:27.696 --> 00:04:32.260\nIt doesn't see it as numbers,\nit's doing it exactly how I type it.\n\n74\n00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.220\nWe'll talk about this little\nthing in just a second.\n\n75\n00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.999\nSo you think, okay, well,\nremember the whole, well, it's entered in\n\n76\n00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:45.709\nas this whole raw data, so I should be\nable to take this, format that to text.\n\n77\n00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:48.190\nDid it bring the zeros back?\n&gt;&gt; It did not, and\n\n78\n00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.730\nthis is a classic case of technically,\na loss of information.\n\n79\n00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.270\nIf this is an ISPN number, or a product\ncode, or something of that nature.\n\n80\n00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.370\nBut the preceding zeros\nare actual important information\n\n81\n00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.900\nthan this healthiness make well let's\njust say there's a little bit of teeth\n\n82\n00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.910\ngnashing gritting clenching of fists and\nthen, well, you start fixing it by\n\n83\n00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.674\npreformatting or some other avenue.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n84\n00:05:11.674 --> 00:05:14.500\nthis is exactly you cannot\nchange this afterwards.\n\n85\n00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.130\nThis is one you have to know\nabout this ahead of time.\n\n86\n00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.630\nYou have to think about this column\nof information that I'm storing.\n\n87\n00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.940\nIt will have the potential like ISBN\nnumbers and product numbers, or zip codes.\n\n88\n00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.280\nOr anything that needs\na zero in front of it.\n\n89\n00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.773\nI better go ahead and\nmake that text to begin with,\n\n90\n00:05:32.773 --> 00:05:35.445\nbecause it sees it as a nothing value.\n\n91\n00:05:35.445 --> 00:05:40.370\nIt's zero, but zero this is the whole zero\nversus null and blanks, and all that.\n\n92\n00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:46.390\nI'll spare you the details, but\nit doesn't see it as a holding value.\n\n93\n00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.150\nSo careful on that kind of information.\n\n94\n00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.411\nThe other reason of why this\nlittle guy has come up.\n\n95\n00:05:53.411 --> 00:05:56.410\nThis little green triangle\nin the top right hand.\n\n96\n00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:57.430\nNow that would be the other right.\n\n97\n00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.960\nThat would be the left corner of the cell\n\n98\n00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.670\nis indicating to you\nthat you have an error.\n\n99\n00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:03.990\nThis is error checking.\n\n100\n00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.170\nNow one, you need to make sure\nyour error checking is on.\n\n101\n00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:10.111\nIf your error checking is off,\nyou might not even see this.\n\n102\n00:06:10.111 --> 00:06:11.480\nYou're like what is that?\n\n103\n00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.460\nIt's actually a preference.\n\n104\n00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.580\nWhy don't I just show you\nwhile I'm thinking about it?\n\n105\n00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.770\nYou go into Excel Preferences\n&gt; Error Checking,\n\n106\n00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:25.470\nit's turned on, so it is going\nto find all of these things and\n\n107\n00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:31.570\nright there show errors for,\nnumbers formatted as text.\n\n108\n00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:36.346\nIt is seeing that, hey, I see this as\nnumbers, but you got it as text, and\n\n109\n00:06:36.346 --> 00:06:38.826\nI think you might have a problem here.\n\n110\n00:06:38.826 --> 00:06:42.229\nTrying to be helpful when you\nreally wanna be like, back up,\n\n111\n00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:44.378\nwe don't need you're help anymore.\n\n112\n00:06:44.378 --> 00:06:48.453\nSo this is why it's going to do this.\n\n113\n00:06:48.453 --> 00:06:52.378\nSo if you don't have it on,\nyou're not gonna get it.\n\n114\n00:06:52.378 --> 00:06:55.680\nCould be a good or bad thing,\ndepends on what you got.\n\n115\n00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.485\nBut notice that there is a little\nwarning sign right next to it.\n\n116\n00:06:59.485 --> 00:07:03.079\nAnd if I click on it,\nactually if I just hover over it for\n\n117\n00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:08.002\na second just to see that it says the\nnumber in this set is formatted as text or\n\n118\n00:07:08.002 --> 00:07:09.746\npreceded by apostrophe.\n\n119\n00:07:09.746 --> 00:07:13.610\nRemember we talked about how we can\navoid that in our introduction episode.\n\n120\n00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.760\nSo this is like, okay,\nyou could either, click on it,\n\n121\n00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.250\nconvert it, ignore, go into your\noptions or edit in the formula.\n\n122\n00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.250\nSo if I say, you know what,\njust stop this, just ignore the error.\n\n123\n00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:25.829\nAnd then the next one\nyou type in guess what?\n\n124\n00:07:25.829 --> 00:07:28.047\nIt's gonna do the same\nthing in the same thing.\n\n125\n00:07:28.047 --> 00:07:31.758\nSo honestly, I just get used to\nlooking at those green triangles and\n\n126\n00:07:31.758 --> 00:07:33.120\nignoring them, okay?\n\n127\n00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.630\nIt's not gonna print.\n\n128\n00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:35.810\nIt's just a display thing.\n\n129\n00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:41.166\nIt can be annoying, but\nyou get over it after a couple of years.\n\n130\n00:07:41.166 --> 00:07:45.987\nSo that's what it's doing there and\nwhy you're going to get those problems or\n\n131\n00:07:45.987 --> 00:07:47.020\njust the boxes.\n\n132\n00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.710\nSo yeah,\nthat why I would take this whole column.\n\n133\n00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:51.728\nI know I need zeros.\n\n134\n00:07:51.728 --> 00:07:55.200\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\njust convert this into text.\n\n135\n00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.076\nI'm also gonna take this and\nI'm gonna convert this whole column,\n\n136\n00:07:59.076 --> 00:08:02.748\nbecause I know That I'm gonna,\nlike this is my section column,\n\n137\n00:08:02.748 --> 00:08:07.310\nmy section numbers if I was doing,\nyou know, core scheduling and everything.\n\n138\n00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:08.970\nSo I would take this to text so\n\n139\n00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:14.060\nthat way I can type in as many 0s\nas I need and it will remember.\n\n140\n00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:20.709\nSee, remember those little triangles,\nthey're gonna pop up every time here,\n\n141\n00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:26.304\n1E24, yes, finally I can go ahead and\ntype in section numbers.\n\n142\n00:08:26.304 --> 00:08:31.060\nIn every semester, every semester\nI'd have section numbers with Es, so\n\n143\n00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.220\nI used this a lot.\n\n144\n00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:37.092\nThat's why I like to go ahead and\nuse the text formatting when I just\n\n145\n00:08:37.092 --> 00:08:41.630\nwant it to give me exactly what I type in,\nso good stuff.\n\n146\n00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:48.150\nNot too terribly hard, it will get\nyou if you're doing dates, okay?\n\n147\n00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:52.786\nKeep that in mind when we talk about\nour dates, it's kind of a big deal and\n\n148\n00:08:52.786 --> 00:08:56.750\nit can really mess you up.\n&gt;&gt; So would you say that text formatting\n\n149\n00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:00.231\nis kind of like hold up Excel, I know\nwhat I'm doing, I don't need your help.\n\n150\n00:09:00.231 --> 00:09:01.595\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We can call it that,\n\n151\n00:09:01.595 --> 00:09:04.137\nyeah, it's like I don't\nneed your help Excel,\n\n152\n00:09:04.137 --> 00:09:08.140\nwe should just rename the number format\nto, [LAUGH] I don't need your help.\n\n153\n00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.410\nYeah pretty much, so\ngood reasons for why we need text.\n\n154\n00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:15.501\nAgain, I'm not changing this to text,\nit's not necessary.\n\n155\n00:09:15.501 --> 00:09:20.143\nSo all right, let's move on to\nour next one, the specials, okay,\n\n156\n00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:21.818\nI like the special ones.\n\n157\n00:09:21.818 --> 00:09:25.730\nThese are one's phone number, okay?\n\n158\n00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:27.980\nThere's a whole bunch of ways\nwe could do phone numbers but\n\n159\n00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:32.532\nlet's just try to keep it in\nthe normal convention, what's normal?\n\n160\n00:09:32.532 --> 00:09:38.160\n[LAUGH] Use your zip code,\nwhat's the thing in the front?\n\n161\n00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.390\nArea code [LAUGH] the area\ncodes in parentheses, right?\n\n162\n00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:45.160\nSo we have 352,\nthat's our area code here in Gainesville,\n\n163\n00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:49.440\nand then you have three numbers then\na dash then four numbers, right?\n\n164\n00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.507\nThat would be our traditional way that\nwe would do numbers here in the good\n\n165\n00:09:53.507 --> 00:09:55.518\nold United States for our numbers.\n\n166\n00:09:55.518 --> 00:09:59.454\nNow I don't wanna have to\ntype in open parentheses,\n\n167\n00:09:59.454 --> 00:10:03.220\n352, close parentheses, [NOISE].\n\n168\n00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:08.206\nNo, wouldn't it just be easier\nif I just 3521234567, yeah, and\n\n169\n00:10:08.206 --> 00:10:09.674\njust it does it for me.\n\n170\n00:10:09.674 --> 00:10:12.110\nWouldn't that be so much easier?\n\n171\n00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:12.989\nYeah, so guess what?\n\n172\n00:10:12.989 --> 00:10:15.542\nThey have a special number format for\nthat.\n\n173\n00:10:15.542 --> 00:10:18.760\nI've selected this entire column and\nI've already typed one in, so\n\n174\n00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.130\nwe've got an example.\n\n175\n00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:26.480\nIf I come into More Number Formats,\nand I go to special, look at that.\n\n176\n00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.340\nThey give us to where we have\nthe zip code, the zip code plus 4,\n\n177\n00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:34.430\nmeaning it would have the five digits,\nthen a dash, then the four digits.\n\n178\n00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.870\nPhone Number, Social Security Number.\n\n179\n00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:41.510\nLet's go with Phone Number, we click OK,\nand then look at that, isn't that neat?\n\n180\n00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:44.381\nIt just types it right in there for\nus, so I can do 5551231234.\n\n181\n00:10:44.381 --> 00:10:48.856\nAnd I don't have to do all the spacing,\n\n182\n00:10:48.856 --> 00:10:52.519\nthe dashes, the parentheses,\n\n183\n00:10:52.519 --> 00:10:58.990\nit's all in there for\nme, that's pretty neat.\n\n184\n00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:04.470\nBut because it's in this number format,\nwhat if I typed in 7?\n\n185\n00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:05.789\nOops, [LAUGH] right?\n\n186\n00:11:05.789 --> 00:11:09.500\nI was like,\nthat's not even the right pattern.\n\n187\n00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:14.970\nBut then I type in a few I have, okay, and\nthen you can see that it starts to do,\n\n188\n00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:19.497\nwell, that's actually just\nshowing that no, you know what?\n\n189\n00:11:19.497 --> 00:11:23.510\nI don't know if I even did this in one\nof my other episodes, I just realized.\n\n190\n00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:27.580\nIf you ever see the number signs in\nyour columns, what does that mean?\n\n191\n00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:29.340\nColumn isn't wide enough\nto show your numbers.\n\n192\n00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:33.480\nI don't think we did that back in\nthe modifying a worksheet, hm.\n\n193\n00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.530\nIt's not recalling, but guess what?\n\n194\n00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:37.310\nWe're here now and\nyou're watching the whole series anyway so\n\n195\n00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:39.960\nwe're good to see that this\nhas come up a couple times and\n\n196\n00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.730\nI don't think I've ever said it,\nthis means that there's a value in here\n\n197\n00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:48.100\nthat cannot display because\nthe column's not wide enough.\n\n198\n00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:52.339\nSo the easiest way to do this is to auto\nfit the cell or the column by double\n\n199\n00:11:52.339 --> 00:11:56.620\nclicking up in the column headers,\nand that's what you've got.\n\n200\n00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.010\nAnd that is not a phone\nnumber is it there Justin?\n\n201\n00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:02.060\nNo it is not, that is a giant area code.\n\n202\n00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:03.850\nI don't know what area that is.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n203\n00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:05.590\n&gt;&gt; But it looks like how it's applying\n\n204\n00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:09.060\nthe pattern is it's moving from the right\nto the left, it's grabbing seven digits\n\n205\n00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.700\nand then it's saying,\nwell there's a remaining three digits.\n\n206\n00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:15.810\nPut parentheses around those,\nwho knows the underlying implementation.\n\n207\n00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:19.220\nI'm gonna ask you Vonne to go back\nto the phone number or the special\n\n208\n00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:23.380\ntypes of phone number, I wanted see if\nthere was an additional setting there.\n\n209\n00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.628\nSo Language,\nif I change that language, and\n\n210\n00:12:26.628 --> 00:12:30.207\nit could be United Kingdom I suppose.\n&gt;&gt; How about we\n\n211\n00:12:30.207 --> 00:12:32.851\ngo French?\n&gt;&gt; Okay if you can read French then we'll\n\n212\n00:12:32.851 --> 00:12:33.997\ngo French.\n&gt;&gt; I can't.\n\n213\n00:12:33.997 --> 00:12:36.080\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, let's see what happens.\n\n214\n00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:39.060\nHow does that change the phone number?\n\n215\n00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:45.650\nIt seems like an odd thing there.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n216\n00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:47.950\n&gt;&gt; So if you have a different formatting\n\n217\n00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:51.910\nfor your phone numbers respective to your\nlocale, it's typically based on English,\n\n218\n00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:54.860\nbecause in the United States\nthere's an implied 1 for\n\n219\n00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:56.012\ncountry code there, right?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n220\n00:12:56.012 --> 00:12:57.467\n&gt;&gt; There's a 1 out front for\n\n221\n00:12:57.467 --> 00:12:58.990\nthe country code.\n\n222\n00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:03.829\nBut it looks like in the French language\nthat the phone number formatting\n\n223\n00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:04.521\nis.\n&gt;&gt; Different.\n\n224\n00:13:04.521 --> 00:13:05.943\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Their's I guess, I don't know.\n\n225\n00:13:05.943 --> 00:13:07.666\n&gt;&gt; Well and this being,\n\n226\n00:13:07.666 --> 00:13:12.260\nagain since I haven't lived\noutside the United States,\n\n227\n00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:16.183\nI know I've called outside\nthe United States but\n\n228\n00:13:16.183 --> 00:13:21.160\nthat looks like, okay if we put\nthis into telephone number for\n\n229\n00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.130\nDanish, and we type in 1231231234.\n\n230\n00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:28.570\nI guess that's how it formats it,\nthere you go.\n\n231\n00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:32.430\nAnd then but then there's this stack,\nwait, that's not the Danish phone number.\n\n232\n00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:36.690\nSo we would have to go through, so,\nsorry, I'm just pulling this down and\n\n233\n00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:38.610\nI'm going to just copy the formats.\n\n234\n00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:44.800\nSo yeah, that's I guess how it's spacing\nthe numbers for a Danish phone number.\n\n235\n00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.180\nSo okay, again,\nI've never really gone outside formatting\n\n236\n00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.020\nanything outside the United States,\nbut that's a really good question.\n\n237\n00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:54.770\nAnd yes, those regional things are going\nto make a big difference especially when\n\n238\n00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:59.820\nwe start getting into dates and how we\ngo ahead and make them look that way for\n\n239\n00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:00.640\nother countries.\n\n240\n00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:04.540\nSo cool, so\nyes the special formats can be nice.\n\n241\n00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:09.518\nAnd Social Security Number,\nyou know again something very US specific,\n\n242\n00:14:09.518 --> 00:14:14.909\nour tax codes, like the numbers,\nits always three, two, then four, right?\n\n243\n00:14:14.909 --> 00:14:19.651\nSo if I format this as a Social Security,\n\n244\n00:14:19.651 --> 00:14:24.407\nwell we need to go back into English.\n\n245\n00:14:24.407 --> 00:14:26.917\nNow okay, whoa,\nthat is not where I wanted to get.\n\n246\n00:14:26.917 --> 00:14:27.960\n&gt;&gt; I don't know where you're\n\n247\n00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:28.557\ngoing Vonne.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n248\n00:14:28.557 --> 00:14:29.630\n&gt;&gt; Too far.\n\n249\n00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:30.290\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n250\n00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:30.790\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n251\n00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:32.573\n&gt;&gt; So you can see that it's gonna show you\n\n252\n00:14:32.573 --> 00:14:36.350\ndifferent things in other languages,\nwe're gonna go with Social Security.\n\n253\n00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:41.340\nWe click OK, so then 123-12-1234,\n\n254\n00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.810\nthat's what it's gonna do,\nit's just gonna put the dashes in there.\n\n255\n00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:45.940\nSo but\nthink about if I'm trying to type that in,\n\n256\n00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:51.300\nit's much easier than doing the dashes and\nthe spaces and everything like that.\n\n257\n00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:56.050\nBut again if you start doing it,\nthat is not right,\n\n258\n00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:58.990\nso that would probably cause\nsome problems wouldn't it?\n\n259\n00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:05.027\nSo, careful,\nyou need to make sure you type in the ten,\n\n260\n00:15:05.027 --> 00:15:09.017\nwait, four, three, yeah, nine.\n\n261\n00:15:09.017 --> 00:15:10.996\n[LAUGH] Justin's over there, going nine.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n262\n00:15:10.996 --> 00:15:11.711\n&gt;&gt; I'm like,\n\n263\n00:15:11.711 --> 00:15:16.450\nI can't add in my head that fast, I told\nyou, [LAUGH] I'm not very good at math.\n\n264\n00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:18.940\nOkay great, so now we have those.\n\n265\n00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:23.696\nBut sometimes that's not gonna,\nthe special doesn't work for us,\n\n266\n00:15:23.696 --> 00:15:29.026\nin a sense, phone numbers, social\nsecurities, what if there's a specific\n\n267\n00:15:29.026 --> 00:15:33.620\npattern that we do for\nour department numbers or section numbers?\n\n268\n00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:37.438\nOr I'm going to do something with\ntemperature where I wanna do like\n\n269\n00:15:37.438 --> 00:15:38.752\nthe degree sign on it?\n\n270\n00:15:38.752 --> 00:15:43.770\nThis is where you start getting in\nthe world of custom number formats.\n\n271\n00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:46.547\nWe talked about this with\na separator value of like,\n\n272\n00:15:46.547 --> 00:15:48.070\nhow do I want this to happen?\n\n273\n00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:52.185\nI do have a website that is pulled up,\nwell I need to go ahead and\n\n274\n00:15:52.185 --> 00:15:57.586\nbring it up first, that it's in a help\nfiles of like, how to create or delete it.\n\n275\n00:15:57.586 --> 00:16:01.492\nWe're not gonna, I'm not gonna\ngo like super far in-depth, but\n\n276\n00:16:01.492 --> 00:16:05.840\nyou can get into how it is shown as\na positive, a negative Zero in the text.\n\n277\n00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:11.021\nSo you can see that you can also apply\nspecial formatting in different syntax,\n\n278\n00:16:11.021 --> 00:16:13.074\nyou can put it in the brackets.\n\n279\n00:16:13.074 --> 00:16:17.957\nI'm not gonna go that far but\nthis does give you some\n\n280\n00:16:17.957 --> 00:16:23.080\nideas of what you can do and\nwhy you might need to do it.\n\n281\n00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.210\nI'm gonna show you my way,\n\n282\n00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:29.470\nI just wanted to give you that\nbackground before we move in to it.\n\n283\n00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:34.550\nSo my favorite examples for these\nthings is like, my department numbers,\n\n284\n00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:38.560\nor employee ID numbers, or\npart number, or what have you.\n\n285\n00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:39.820\nIt's always gonna follow a pattern.\n\n286\n00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:45.600\nFor example, what if our department\nnumbers are always going to\n\n287\n00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:51.230\nbe OPTV, so OfficeProTV.\n\n288\n00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:56.600\nSo OPTV, and then two digits,\nthen there's a dash, then\n\n289\n00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.750\nthere's another two digits, then there's\na dash, there's another two digits.\n\n290\n00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:03.610\nMaybe that's like your department code,\n\n291\n00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:08.370\nyour post code, and your computer code.\n\n292\n00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:10.387\nI'm totally making this up,\nbut you get the idea, right?\n\n293\n00:17:10.387 --> 00:17:13.020\nThis is common throughout\na lot of businesses.\n\n294\n00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:16.308\nI wanna be able to just type in 1,\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and\n\n295\n00:17:16.308 --> 00:17:18.140\nit does everything else for me.\n\n296\n00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:23.270\nAnything that you want to\nkeep as a string of text,\n\n297\n00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:26.060\nyou're gonna need to put in quotes.\n\n298\n00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:31.300\nAnything that could\npotentially be a 0 as a number\n\n299\n00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:35.550\nneeds to be 0s as opposed to pound.\n\n300\n00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:40.310\nLet's just come over for\na second and do a quick example, and\n\n301\n00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:41.740\nthen we'll go a little bit further.\n\n302\n00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:44.850\nI'm gonna take this whole column,\nI'm gonna go into, you know what,\n\n303\n00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:45.590\nlet's go a different way.\n\n304\n00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:47.488\nLet's right click and\ngo into Format Cells.\n\n305\n00:17:47.488 --> 00:17:49.860\nCuz I've been going to that\ndrop down this whole time.\n\n306\n00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.139\nSo I'm gonna come into Custom, okay?\n\n307\n00:17:52.139 --> 00:17:58.050\nSo see there is, you can either do a pound\nsign or a number sign, or you can do a 0.\n\n308\n00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:02.890\nThe difference is the number\nsign is 1 through 9 and\n\n309\n00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:04.830\nit will drop your preceding 0.\n\n310\n00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:08.660\nIf it's gonna be a 0,\nif by any chance it could be 0,\n\n311\n00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:10.425\nyou need to designate that as 0.\n\n312\n00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:15.850\nJust for fun let's just do pound or\n\n313\n00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:20.960\nnumber, I'm going to open the quote,\nI'm going to put in the dash and\n\n314\n00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.810\nI'm gonna close the quote, and\nthen I'm gonna go number, number.\n\n315\n00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:30.140\nSo what I'm saying is I'm going to\nhave two digits, then I want a dash,\n\n316\n00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:35.640\nor maybe just for fun let's do three\ndashes, just say that it's just text.\n\n317\n00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.840\nClose the quote for my text,\ntwo more digits, and\n\n318\n00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.760\nthat's going to be for this whole column.\n\n319\n00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:51.341\nSo that means if I type\nin 1133 it does that,\n\n320\n00:18:51.341 --> 00:18:55.640\n2288, 0000.\n\n321\n00:18:55.640 --> 00:19:01.788\nNope, not gonna do it, because I\ndidn't designate it to hold a 0 value.\n\n322\n00:19:01.788 --> 00:19:06.944\nBut if I took this, came back to my custom\n\n323\n00:19:06.944 --> 00:19:12.100\nnumber format, and in here we changed it\n\n324\n00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:17.269\nfrom pound signs to 0s, now I click OK.\n\n325\n00:19:17.269 --> 00:19:21.680\nAt this point it did come back, okay,\nbecause it's custom number format.\n\n326\n00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:29.215\nSo it understood that I typed in 0, so now\nI could be 01, 08, and it will hold it.\n\n327\n00:19:29.215 --> 00:19:31.920\nSo that's the difference between\nthe pounds and the 0, so\n\n328\n00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.987\nkeep that it mind when\nyou're doing things.\n\n329\n00:19:33.987 --> 00:19:38.613\nSo I'm gonna be in my ITProTV,\nOfficeProTV, sorry,\n\n330\n00:19:38.613 --> 00:19:43.850\ndepartment codes,\nyou need to remember that 0 reverses it.\n\n331\n00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:48.338\nSo I'm gonna take this, we're gonna take\nour custom number formats again, and\n\n332\n00:19:48.338 --> 00:19:49.730\nwe got to think this out.\n\n333\n00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:56.589\nSo I want OfficePro, OPTV, to be in there,\nso I'm going to open the quote.\n\n334\n00:19:56.589 --> 00:20:01.479\nLet me zoom in for you,\nOPTV, then I'm going\n\n335\n00:20:01.479 --> 00:20:06.730\nto close the quote, cuz that's my text.\n\n336\n00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:11.740\nI want two placeholders or\ntwo number placeholders that could be 0s.\n\n337\n00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:17.980\nI then need a dash, so I'm gonna open\nthe quote, push the dash, close the quote.\n\n338\n00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:21.983\nTwo more numbers, open the quote,\ndash, close the quote.\n\n339\n00:20:21.983 --> 00:20:23.390\nRemember cuz that's,\n\n340\n00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:27.406\nat every point if this is text you've\ngotta put them in your quotes.\n\n341\n00:20:27.406 --> 00:20:30.165\nThen two more, okay?\n\n342\n00:20:30.165 --> 00:20:32.335\nIt looks kind of crazy, doesn't it?\n\n343\n00:20:32.335 --> 00:20:35.448\nBut the cool thing is,\nthis is making it to where,\n\n344\n00:20:35.448 --> 00:20:38.202\nI'm gonna just double check on that, yep.\n\n345\n00:20:38.202 --> 00:20:43.177\nIt means that all I have\nto do is type in 123456,\n\n346\n00:20:43.177 --> 00:20:46.497\nand it does all of that for me.\n\n347\n00:20:46.497 --> 00:20:52.460\nThat could be fun, so,\nwhoops, there you go.\n\n348\n00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:56.335\nSo that's nice that it will take that,\nthat just like your special number\n\n349\n00:20:56.335 --> 00:21:01.990\nformats, if I take this, it's going\nfrom that right hand side again.\n\n350\n00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:05.800\nAnd so it will put in,\nif I just type in 3,\n\n351\n00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:09.730\nthen it puts the 0s all on there\nbecause I told it to have 0s.\n\n352\n00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:14.270\nSo you have to kind of take\nthe good with the bad, you know?\n\n353\n00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:17.240\nTake them both and\nthere you have the facts of Excel.\n\n354\n00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:20.820\nI mean this is just how it's going\nto work, but it can be nice,\n\n355\n00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:23.920\nespecially if I had\na department name like that.\n\n356\n00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.508\nFill it all in with\na custom number format, and\n\n357\n00:21:25.508 --> 00:21:29.150\nthen I only have to type the numbers.\n&gt;&gt; No Vonne, does this also apply by\n\n358\n00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:33.230\ncopy and paste from, let's say I'm copying\nand pasting from I don't know, Word, or\n\n359\n00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:35.810\nsomething like that and\nI paste in that column.\n\n360\n00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:41.352\nIf it conforms to that format, do I still\nget the special formatting by default?\n\n361\n00:21:41.352 --> 00:21:44.370\n&gt;&gt; Meaning this would be typed into Word?\n\n362\n00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:47.931\nI guess.\n&gt;&gt; It could be typed into anything else,\n\n363\n00:21:47.931 --> 00:21:51.155\nand I grab that column or\ninformation and I paste it over there.\n\n364\n00:21:51.155 --> 00:21:51.840\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n365\n00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:55.410\n&gt;&gt; Do I still get the OPTV, number,\n\n366\n00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:56.230\nnumber, number?\n\n367\n00:21:56.230 --> 00:22:00.130\nOr is it only when I type?\n&gt;&gt; So would it be, okay, from here,\n\n368\n00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:04.150\nif I had 551233, that's six digits, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n369\n00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:05.880\n&gt;&gt; Okay so let's try it,\n\n370\n00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.090\nI'm gonna copy,\nI just did a Command+C so you can,\n\n371\n00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:13.700\nI'm doing Command+Tab to switch,\ncome over here, Command, paste.\n\n372\n00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:18.850\nThis is where I am doing my paste options,\nso if I match that,\n\n373\n00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:22.570\nif it's straight numbers, now if it\nhad all of that other stuff in it,\n\n374\n00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:25.360\nI can't guarantee this is gonna work\nevery time cuz this is going from Word.\n\n375\n00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:31.880\nIf it doesn't see it as, might just see\nit as text that might overwrite it.\n\n376\n00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:35.290\nBut you do have your paste options\nof source versus match, you know,\n\n377\n00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:38.380\ndestination versus source,\nso that could throw it off.\n\n378\n00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:43.827\nI would say you're gonna have to take this\non a case by case basis, cuz depending\n\n379\n00:22:43.827 --> 00:22:48.890\non what it sees it as when you copy,\nit might make a big difference, okay?\n\n380\n00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:53.423\nSince they're just straight numbers,\nyes, six digits, go in there and format,\n\n381\n00:22:53.423 --> 00:22:55.450\nit's with a special number format.\n\n382\n00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:56.954\nCool, good question by the way.\n\n383\n00:22:56.954 --> 00:22:59.138\nSo can't guarantee the results.\n\n384\n00:22:59.138 --> 00:23:03.301\n[LAUGH] Nice, so that's what you can\ndo with your custom number formats,\n\n385\n00:23:03.301 --> 00:23:07.617\nyou just gotta watch, remember the string\nof text and that's pretty fun.\n\n386\n00:23:07.617 --> 00:23:11.075\nThe temperature one is one that\nI always like to throw in there.\n\n387\n00:23:11.075 --> 00:23:14.575\nThis might be do you really\nneed the degree sign on that?\n\n388\n00:23:14.575 --> 00:23:20.643\nBut the degree sign is not a character,\nI don't have that on my keyboard, do I?\n\n389\n00:23:20.643 --> 00:23:21.601\nI sure don't, okay?\n\n390\n00:23:21.601 --> 00:23:23.778\nAnd I this is something that,\n\n391\n00:23:23.778 --> 00:23:29.552\nI'm not sure if we did this in the insert\ntext episode either, but guess what?\n\n392\n00:23:29.552 --> 00:23:31.274\nWe're gonna do it here.\n\n393\n00:23:31.274 --> 00:23:36.915\nThe degree sign is not\na alpha-numerical character on\n\n394\n00:23:36.915 --> 00:23:42.940\nour keyboard,\nit is what would be known as a symbol.\n\n395\n00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:46.350\nSo when I come over here to\nthe Insert tab on the ribbon, and\n\n396\n00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:50.710\nall the way over here there is a symbol,\nif I click on this,\n\n397\n00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:54.000\nthis actually brings up, look,\nall the fun emojis, right?\n\n398\n00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.538\nWe got our little smiley faces,\nthe one that's barfing, you know,\n\n399\n00:23:57.538 --> 00:24:00.046\n[LAUGH] that kind of stuff,\nthose are always fun.\n\n400\n00:24:00.046 --> 00:24:04.780\nBut that's great, I could use that,\nbut I'm not looking for that.\n\n401\n00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.790\nThis kinda throws people off at first,\nat least it does me.\n\n402\n00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:13.500\nCuz I'm used to it showing up like\nthe symbol dialog box in the PC world.\n\n403\n00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:17.570\nBut if I scroll over here, do you see\nwhere it says, the Next Categories?\n\n404\n00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:19.910\nIf I click on that, here we go.\n\n405\n00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:26.090\nNow I'm getting into other symbols\nthat I'm used to looking at.\n\n406\n00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:31.390\nAnd I'm like all right, but\nI still don't see the degrees.\n\n407\n00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:34.310\nSo up at the top I could\nactually search for it.\n\n408\n00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:38.950\nAnd there's also another mode or\n\n409\n00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:42.700\na viewing, if you wanna say,\nof what you're looking at for symbols.\n\n410\n00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:48.323\nCuz yes, emojis are symbols, but\nI want symbols as like my askey numbers,\n\n411\n00:24:48.323 --> 00:24:52.940\nlike #169 which is the copyright symbol,\nthose types of things.\n\n412\n00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:56.280\nSo if you click here,\nI'm gonna zoom out a little bit.\n\n413\n00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:59.610\nNotice that it's showing me,\nokay there's emojis, there's arrows,\n\n414\n00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:00.800\nthere's bullet characters.\n\n415\n00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.770\nSo there's some other\nones that you can do.\n\n416\n00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:08.480\nAnd it's just showing you, in a little\nbit different way, for your symbols.\n\n417\n00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:13.540\nSo if I type in degree,\nonce I get here, there it is!\n\n418\n00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:19.020\nThere's a unicode name for the degree\nsymbol, the degree sign, I like that.\n\n419\n00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:23.780\nYou can also add these to your favorites,\nso there's ways that you can kinda use\n\n420\n00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:29.850\nthis dialog box to your advantage and\nI could add that to my favorites.\n\n421\n00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:32.860\nAnd now I have a whole section of my\n\n422\n00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:36.580\nspecial characters that\nI might use frequently.\n\n423\n00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:37.800\nNow, why am I going to this?\n\n424\n00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:44.860\nBecause maybe I want to be able to type\nin 0 and it puts the degree or 12.\n\n425\n00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:46.330\nNow this is where are we\ntalking about Celsius?\n\n426\n00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:48.840\nAre we talking about Fahrenheit?\n\n427\n00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:56.670\nThat's hey, we would have to just know\nit's in Fahrenheit or it's in Celsius.\n\n428\n00:25:56.670 --> 00:26:00.520\nConvergence and all that kind of stuff,\nthat's a whole other ball game.\n\n429\n00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:04.880\nSo it's the whole knowing your data,\nbut I can't put that in.\n\n430\n00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:10.390\nSo what I would do is I would go ahead and\ntake, I would like to insert this symbol.\n\n431\n00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:11.980\nAnd by the way,\nI just double clicked on it.\n\n432\n00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:13.080\nSo it went ahead and put that in.\n\n433\n00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:18.460\nI wanna be able to type in a value and\nput the degree sign.\n\n434\n00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:23.480\nSo I take this and I'm going to cut or\ncopy, I am gonna cut it for this reason.\n\n435\n00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:28.490\nAnd then, I am gonna go into\nmy special number formats, or\n\n436\n00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:34.590\nmy custom number formats,\nwe'll come into here, so what do I want?\n\n437\n00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:36.750\nThere is zero degrees, isn't there?\n\n438\n00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:38.820\nThere is also 100 degrees.\n\n439\n00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:42.950\nNow you probably don't wanna show\nyour degrees as like 030 for\n\n440\n00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:46.420\n30 degrees,\nthat doesn't make any sense, right?\n\n441\n00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:49.970\nBut there could be a zero by itself.\n\n442\n00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:56.084\nSo what I would do is I would type in the\nzero and then I would just open the quote.\n\n443\n00:26:56.084 --> 00:27:00.649\nPaste, Control+V or Command+V.\n\n444\n00:27:00.649 --> 00:27:03.010\nAnd then close the quote.\n\n445\n00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:04.050\nSo I'm saying, yes,\n\n446\n00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:10.620\nallow the 0 at this place holder in case I\never type it by itself, but don't drop it.\n\n447\n00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:15.920\nSo if I click OK, now if I type in 12 45,\n\n448\n00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:20.380\n123, 0, there we go.\n\n449\n00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:26.100\nSo now I can -5.\n\n450\n00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:27.430\nNow I have degrees.\n\n451\n00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:31.134\nSo this is just something that you can\nkinda play around with your custom number\n\n452\n00:27:31.134 --> 00:27:34.410\nformats and be able to pull\nin symbols if you needed to.\n\n453\n00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:39.090\nJust remember to keep it in quotes so.\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne,\n\n454\n00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:40.650\nI do have a question about this.\n\n455\n00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:44.950\nI noticed in some of the other custom\nformats, there was a pound and a zero.\n\n456\n00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:48.550\nIn the context of this,\nof our temperatures,\n\n457\n00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:52.710\nwould that say if there's a number\nin front, it's one through nine, and\n\n458\n00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:56.220\nthen the last number could be a zero,\nbut the other numbers could not.\n\n459\n00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:58.800\nCould I enforce that\nthrough that convention?\n\n460\n00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.160\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you could.\n\n461\n00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:05.660\nAnd that's where if we go back to\nsome of those custom number formats.\n\n462\n00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:09.650\nYeah, it's basically saying, okay,\nthese are all, there will be a zero and\n\n463\n00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:11.910\nthen numbers all the way through.\n\n464\n00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:15.150\nAnd it's actually showing you\nthat this is an actual space.\n\n465\n00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:17.590\nSo those different phone number codes and\n\n466\n00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:21.260\nthings like that in the different\ncountries, I mean that's what it's doing.\n\n467\n00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:26.620\nSo here, if I typed in a pound sign,\nright there, is that what you're asking?\n\n468\n00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:31.974\nSo if I took that and then okay.\n\n469\n00:28:31.974 --> 00:28:36.310\nBut it's just saying you could have\na number there, but it's kind of implied,\n\n470\n00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:40.110\ntoo, it's just saying that\nlast one has to be a zero.\n\n471\n00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:43.470\nSo that's the biggest thing,\nand you can see some of them,\n\n472\n00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:46.580\nit's almost like with the currency codes.\n\n473\n00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:49.040\nOkay, that last one could be a zero, but\n\n474\n00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:52.360\nthe rest of them could all be numbers.\n&gt;&gt; What if I typed 00 now in this?\n\n475\n00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:56.230\nWould it remove the zeros,\nso I get a single zero.\n\n476\n00:28:56.230 --> 00:29:00.860\nIf I take that off, if I take off\nthe pound sign in that custom formatting,\n\n477\n00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:03.590\ndoes it still just\ndefault to a single zero?\n\n478\n00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:09.110\nOr does it now allow me to type 00?\n&gt;&gt; It's still gonna drop it,\n\n479\n00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:14.100\nbecause if I needed it to be zero in\nthe front, I would have to do 00.\n\n480\n00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:17.770\nBut that's another one that\ngets a little weird too, okay?\n\n481\n00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:22.400\nSo let's go back to I want two of them,\nright?\n\n482\n00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:26.280\nSo now, all of those, say anything.\n\n483\n00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:28.010\nIf I typed in 1, it's 01.\n\n484\n00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:33.440\nIf I type in 6,\nit's gonna force it to have it.\n\n485\n00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.620\nCuz you're saying,\nthis is a placeholder, and\n\n486\n00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:37.890\nit will always show a 0 in front of it.\n\n487\n00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:43.090\nSo that's where the, if you don't know if\nit's gonna have numbers in front of it.\n\n488\n00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:47.920\nIt could be a 1000 degrees, it could\nbe 100 degrees, it could be 0 degrees.\n\n489\n00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:55.120\nYou only want the zero on that last\nplaceholder, like in the ones holder,\n\n490\n00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:58.840\nthat's where you want the zero, not in\nthe tens or the hundreds or what have you.\n\n491\n00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.370\nIt takes a little bit of getting used to.\n\n492\n00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:05.130\nI mean you do have to play around with it,\nyou can go pretty far in-depth with this.\n\n493\n00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:08.460\nBut it's the same conventions\nthat are through here,\n\n494\n00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:11.830\nand that's why I brought up the Help file\nif you want a little bit more information.\n\n495\n00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:13.430\nHow is it gonna treat\nyour negative numbers?\n\n496\n00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:17.120\nHow is it gonna treat your zero values,\nall of that.\n\n497\n00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:23.390\nBut the quotes for the text, the pound for\nthe number, or the number for the number\n\n498\n00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:28.530\nand zero for, you need to accept a zero\nvalue in that particular placeholder.\n\n499\n00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:29.630\nSo, could be fun.\n\n500\n00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:34.000\nLot of good stuff, I like it for\nthese things, and then the text for\n\n501\n00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.560\nmy section numbers.\n\n502\n00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:38.140\nAnd the custom or the special for\nlike the phone numbers.\n\n503\n00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:41.970\nA lot of good things cuz we're not\nalways storing numbers as numbers.\n\n504\n00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:45.050\nIt could be different values and\n\n505\n00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:47.360\nconnotations apply to them.\n&gt;&gt; Well Vonne,\n\n506\n00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:51.240\nyou've definitely opened my eyes to custom\nnumber formats because I can't tell you\n\n507\n00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:56.130\nhow many times I've spent a ridiculous\namount of time adding parentheses or\n\n508\n00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:58.560\ncopying and pasting the degree symbol.\n\n509\n00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:02.590\nSo thank you so much for that, and I know\nwe got dates and times coming up, and\n\n510\n00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:04.860\nwell if you're ready for it,\nthen definitely come on back.\n\n511\n00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:06.470\nBut for now we're going to go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n512\n00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:09.220\nSo signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennis.\n\n513\n00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:10.020\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n514\n00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:12.464\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n515\n00:31:12.464 --> 00:31:13.700\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.474 --> 00:00:17.031\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and\n\n4\n00:00:17.031 --> 00:00:19.671\nwe're back with more Excel\n2016 essentials for Mac.\n\n5\n00:00:19.671 --> 00:00:22.351\nAnd well,\nwe're continuing on in number formats.\n\n6\n00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:25.330\nWe're up to our eyeballs\nin number formats and well,\n\n7\n00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.190\nwe're gonna talk about dates and\ntimes today.\n\n8\n00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.270\nIt's funny because they sound simple,\nbut yet, they are not.\n\n9\n00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.095\nAnd here to help us kind of reveal how\nnot simple they are, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n10\n00:00:37.095 --> 00:00:38.125\nHow are you doing today, Vonne?\n\n11\n00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:39.175\nI'm doing pretty good.\n\n12\n00:00:39.175 --> 00:00:42.620\nYeah, we are up to our eyeballs\nin number formats, yeah.\n\n13\n00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.335\nAnd my eyes feel like they're\nstarting to close a little bit.\n\n14\n00:00:45.335 --> 00:00:51.265\nHopefully yours aren't and, we're keeping\nyou awake enough for, yes, date and times.\n\n15\n00:00:51.265 --> 00:00:56.120\nWhew, yeah, we should probably\nstart off by talking about\n\n16\n00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.400\nthe world date formats,\nand there's so many ways.\n\n17\n00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.680\nSo if I told you, Justin,\nhow would you normally say what today is?\n\n18\n00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.069\nWell, I would give it to\nyou as a month-day-year, so\n\n19\n00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:14.475\nlike March 18th, 2018 or\nsomething like that.\n\n20\n00:01:14.475 --> 00:01:15.979\nIt's the 12th right now, but close enough.\n\n21\n00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.830\n[LAUGH] Tomato tomato,\nVonne, tomato tomato.\n\n22\n00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.450\n[LAUGH] I know, I'm like is he gonna look\ndown at his computer to look at the little\n\n23\n00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:23.342\ncalendar icon?\n\n24\n00:01:23.342 --> 00:01:25.783\n[LAUGH] No, I took a shot, and\nthen you made me feel bad about it.\n\n25\n00:01:25.783 --> 00:01:27.355\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] That's what I'm here for.\n\n26\n00:01:27.355 --> 00:01:29.830\n[LAUGH] So, but yes, exactly.\n\n27\n00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.610\nHere in America, that we go ahead and\nsay that yeah, it is March 12th, 2018.\n\n28\n00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:43.520\nAnd we put the comma after the day,\nand that's how we display our dates.\n\n29\n00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.480\nOkay, great, that's if we're talking and\nwe're writing it,\n\n30\n00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.718\nwe could call it, longhand, okay?\n\n31\n00:01:49.718 --> 00:01:54.717\nBut then what are some common separators\nthat we can have between those month,\n\n32\n00:01:54.717 --> 00:01:56.275\ndays and years?\n\n33\n00:01:56.275 --> 00:01:59.869\nSo I've seen slashes, back slash?\n\n34\n00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:00.655\nForward slash?\n\n35\n00:02:00.655 --> 00:02:01.695\nForward slash.\nI don't know.\n\n36\n00:02:01.695 --> 00:02:02.865\nOne of those slashes.\n\n37\n00:02:02.865 --> 00:02:05.635\nLet me look at my keyboard,\nI'm pretty sure it's a forward slash.\n\n38\n00:02:05.635 --> 00:02:08.285\nSo month, day, year with forward slashes.\n\n39\n00:02:08.285 --> 00:02:12.945\nAlong with those, I can sometimes have\na two digit year, or a four digit year.\n\n40\n00:02:12.945 --> 00:02:17.760\nTo remove ambiguity, I try to adopt\na four digit year at all times.\n\n41\n00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.780\nAnd I've also seen dashes,\nso that's always fun.\n\n42\n00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.560\nAnd the same applies for the year.\n\n43\n00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.060\nAlso seen zero padded months, zero padded\ndays, non-zero padded months and days.\n\n44\n00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.105\nAnd yes, those seem like nuances,\nbut they can lead to ambiguity,\n\n45\n00:02:33.105 --> 00:02:37.720\nnot only with the separator, but\nthe respective numbers that we report.\n\n46\n00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.400\nAnd sometimes I get a little bit twisted\n\n47\n00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.650\nin trying to realize what\ndate I'm talking about.\n\n48\n00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.450\nYeah, exactly and\nthat's how the countries of\n\n49\n00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.680\nthe world format dates,\nthat can get a little weird.\n\n50\n00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.720\nSo I actually have some,\na Wikipedia article pulled up, so\n\n51\n00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.900\nwhy don't we go ahead and look at this,\nin this date format by country.\n\n52\n00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.040\nAnd so you can see that we have,\nI think typically though, y for\n\n53\n00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.400\nyear, m for month, d for day.\n\n54\n00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.940\nBut then, how do you go ahead and\n\n55\n00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.320\nput them, the two, the four,\nyou know, all these different things.\n\n56\n00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.890\nAnd do you do slashes,or the stroke\nthat they're saying here, the dot.\n\n57\n00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.370\nYou could separate by dots,\nhyphens, or dashes, or spaces.\n\n58\n00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.280\nOkay, and then I [LAUGH],\nI thought this was a fun one.\n\n59\n00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.410\nSo it's like the different colors, right?\n\n60\n00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.730\nAnd then look at so many blue or cyan, and\nthen yep, we're over here in magenta just\n\n61\n00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.590\nhanging out by ourselves, like always,\nhaving to do different things.\n\n62\n00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.720\nBut you can see Canada's off\nin its own little world too.\n\n63\n00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.540\nSo hey, we're not alone.\n\n64\n00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.060\nBut anyways, you can see that,\nlike how it goes ahead and\n\n65\n00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.800\nformats, and then we have that short\nformat, we have the long format, and\n\n66\n00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.620\nthen all the different ways that\nit's going to go ahead and do this.\n\n67\n00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.010\nAnd it's kinda fun to where we do month,\nday, year, right?\n\n68\n00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.101\nAnd then it's just kind\nof like all of this,\n\n69\n00:04:01.101 --> 00:04:05.620\nand then it goes to like a whole\nbunch of nos, no, no, no, no.\n\n70\n00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.550\nOkay, so yeah,\n\n71\n00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.580\nhopefully I didn't just like give you\nmotion sickness by going so fast.\n\n72\n00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.560\nBut there's so many different\nways that we can do this, and\n\n73\n00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.610\nhow our separators come out.\n\n74\n00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.450\nAnd what it's doing to do for\nyou, you have to know your data,\n\n75\n00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.630\nyou need to know how\nyou want to display it.\n\n76\n00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.790\nAnd then once you do,\n\n77\n00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.770\nonce you decide that big factor, then\nyou gotta know how to make Excel do it.\n\n78\n00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.880\nSo and\nit can get you tripped up pretty quickly.\n\n79\n00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.170\nSo back here,\n\n80\n00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.330\nwe did talk about this in the introduction\nabout how in the general number format,\n\n81\n00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.920\nlet me switch back over here to my home\ntab so we can see our number format there.\n\n82\n00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:51.030\nIf I typed in, let's go 1-1-01, okay?\n\n83\n00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:59.300\nThat is January 1st, but\nis it 2001, or is it 1901, right?\n\n84\n00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.120\nSo which one is it?\n\n85\n00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.510\nWell it went ahead and\ndefaulted to the 2001,\n\n86\n00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.190\nsomething you need to be careful\nabout when you're doing your dates.\n\n87\n00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:14.530\nAnd I did type in dashes, and it turned it\nto slashes, and that is the forward slash.\n\n88\n00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:22.499\nSo if I type in 06/06/12, right?\n\n89\n00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:26.186\nThat's a date, so that's June, right?\n\n90\n00:05:26.186 --> 00:05:30.110\n[LAUGH] June 6th, 2012.\n\n91\n00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.001\nBut it took off the zero, okay?\n\n92\n00:05:32.001 --> 00:05:36.231\nAnd if I typed in, let's go 050,\n\n93\n00:05:36.231 --> 00:05:40.876\noops, let's go ahead and do with dash.\n\n94\n00:05:40.876 --> 00:05:44.843\n05-2012, that's what I was trying to do.\n\n95\n00:05:44.843 --> 00:05:48.556\nAgain, it took off those things because\nthat's where it's doing the automatic\n\n96\n00:05:48.556 --> 00:05:49.126\nflipping.\n\n97\n00:05:49.126 --> 00:05:55.100\nBut, I preformatted some of our cells,\nhere, this one is a date.\n\n98\n00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.674\nBut, if we typed it in, okay,\n\n99\n00:05:58.674 --> 00:06:04.510\n12-12-12, well, look what it did.\n\n100\n00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:09.264\nIt's the 12th of December in 2012, okay?\n\n101\n00:06:09.264 --> 00:06:12.370\nBecause I formatted that way.\n\n102\n00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:19.524\nBut all of these are going to be,\nand I keep on, we could do 05-05-85.\n\n103\n00:06:19.524 --> 00:06:23.143\nSo now you can see that it's flipping\nit because I've already formatted this\n\n104\n00:06:23.143 --> 00:06:23.650\nas a date.\n\n105\n00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.920\nBut you gotta be careful when\nyou change this to text.\n\n106\n00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:33.630\nAnd I'm going to notice that my\ncell formatting right now is text,\n\n107\n00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.340\nso if I did 05-05-85.\n\n108\n00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.763\nIt's not flipping, is it?\n\n109\n00:06:38.763 --> 00:06:39.638\nCuz it's text.\n\n110\n00:06:39.638 --> 00:06:43.690\nAnd then if I did 6/6/2000 and\n\n111\n00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:48.510\nwhoops, that's the wrong one, 2012.\n\n112\n00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.640\nNot gonna flip it, okay?\n\n113\n00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.950\nThese are are already\ntalking in date format.\n\n114\n00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:01.090\nSo if I flipped these over, and\nlet's go ahead and take these,\n\n115\n00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.030\nI'm just going to select these cells,\njust these.\n\n116\n00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:08.200\nAnd if I come in to date, notice there's\na short date and there is a long date, but\n\n117\n00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:14.320\nthen there are a whole bunch more\nways that I can format dates.\n\n118\n00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.430\nDo I want the day?\n\n119\n00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:17.650\nDo I want the two digits?\n\n120\n00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:18.906\nDo I want the three digits?\n\n121\n00:07:18.906 --> 00:07:19.920\nThree digits?\n\n122\n00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.780\nFour digits?\n\n123\n00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:25.400\nAll of those different ways that I would\nwant it to be displayed, you can do that.\n\n124\n00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.730\nSo if I wanted it to be March 14th,\n2012, meaning the example.\n\n125\n00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.050\nNotice up here it is showing it that way.\n\n126\n00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:35.710\nI click OK, it will flip that way.\n\n127\n00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:41.150\nIf I wanna do it in this way, right?\n\n128\n00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.400\nSo then it's gonna flip it over.\n\n129\n00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.740\nBut watch if I take these.\n\n130\n00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:49.970\nLet's go ahead and include these in here,\nthese cells down here.\n\n131\n00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.180\nAnd I change this to, let's do short date.\n\n132\n00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.120\nThat didn't flip, did it?\n\n133\n00:07:55.570 --> 00:08:00.656\nIf I did the long date,\nthat didn't flip either.\n\n134\n00:08:00.656 --> 00:08:05.941\nIf you have your cells formatted as text,\nand you enter a date,\n\n135\n00:08:05.941 --> 00:08:10.650\nit will not see it as a date\nno matter what you do.\n\n136\n00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:15.347\nThis actually, this happened in one of\nour co-workers and a good friend of mine.\n\n137\n00:08:15.347 --> 00:08:17.430\nAnd she's like, I don't understand\nwhat's going on with this?\n\n138\n00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:21.388\nAnd I'm like, it took me a little bit too,\nI'm like wait, hold on.\n\n139\n00:08:21.388 --> 00:08:25.350\nSomehow those cells\nare not seeing as a date,\n\n140\n00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:29.000\nso you can't go to all these different\nformats that I'm showing you how to do it,\n\n141\n00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.430\nbecause it's never gonna see it that way.\n\n142\n00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:34.790\nAnd that's something that you watch it,\nokay?\n\n143\n00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:36.467\nThat preformatting and\n\n144\n00:08:36.467 --> 00:08:41.757\nthe text will wreck your world [LAUGH] if\nyou are trying to make that as a date.\n\n145\n00:08:41.757 --> 00:08:44.590\nI'll how you a little fix, but\nthat's something to think about.\n\n146\n00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.378\nThis seems to be a running theme, right?\n\n147\n00:08:46.378 --> 00:08:49.810\n[LAUGH] Preformatting versus\npost formatting, well,\n\n148\n00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:53.600\nit gets a whole bunch of sideways,\nso keep that in mind.\n\n149\n00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.801\nI do have a question about the typing\nin dates, we did dashes and slashes,\n\n150\n00:08:56.801 --> 00:08:57.587\nwhat about dots?\n\n151\n00:08:57.587 --> 00:09:01.380\nWhat if we did 1.1.79,\ndo I get auto formatting?\n\n152\n00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.847\nBecause that was one of those\naccepted shorthand formats.\n\n153\n00:09:04.847 --> 00:09:05.350\nMm-hm.\n\n154\n00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:08.280\nSo I'm kind of interested,\ndoes it recognize that one as well?\n\n155\n00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.600\nNot that way, no,\nit does not see dots, okay?\n\n156\n00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:16.301\nBut we did see it in\nthe Wikipedia article, so\n\n157\n00:09:16.301 --> 00:09:19.778\n01.01-2014, nope.\n\n158\n00:09:19.778 --> 00:09:23.320\nBut it was preformatted as a date,\nwe saw that, right?\n\n159\n00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.750\nSo it's not understanding that.\n\n160\n00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:29.332\nThis would be one of those, you'd probably\nwant to do a custom number format,\n\n161\n00:09:29.332 --> 00:09:31.470\nif you really,\nreally wanted to keep it as it.\n\n162\n00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:35.618\nI probably, that's what I answer for\neverything is custom number formats, but\n\n163\n00:09:35.618 --> 00:09:37.260\nit doesn't understand that.\n\n164\n00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.750\nSo that is something to think about.\n\n165\n00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:40.760\nNow the other thing is that,\n\n166\n00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.850\nhere I'm gonna undo those two things,\nwe said that these are dates.\n\n167\n00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.330\nWe know that this cell is formatted,\nit's a date and it's a long date.\n\n168\n00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:54.730\nSo if I did that 2001,\nwhat if I typed in 1, 2, 3, 3.\n\n169\n00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:00.446\nThat is May 17th, Sunday, May 17th, 1903.\n\n170\n00:10:00.446 --> 00:10:03.444\nWhat is going on there?\n\n171\n00:10:03.444 --> 00:10:05.360\nDo you know about this there, Justin?\n\n172\n00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:10.480\nThis is why dates and times are so hard\nto handle whether through data entry or\n\n173\n00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:15.020\nprogramming or, mainly because there's\naccepted conventions, or there's\n\n174\n00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:19.670\nan assumption that, if it looks like this,\nthen this is how you derive that number.\n\n175\n00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:22.948\nTechnically, computer-wise, all of\nthese are numbers behind the scenes,\n\n176\n00:10:22.948 --> 00:10:25.290\nthat's why we're talking\nabout number formattings.\n\n177\n00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:29.190\nAnd dates are always in\nreference to a previous date.\n\n178\n00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:36.600\nSo I'm gonna guess that 12, 1233, is\nsome unit of time since some other date.\n\n179\n00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.840\nAm I close?\n\n180\n00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.708\nKind of.\n\n181\n00:10:38.708 --> 00:10:44.220\n[LAUGH] Yes, in the sense that you know\nthat computers don't see it as a date.\n\n182\n00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.400\nIt doesn't know what today is,\nit just knows it's a number, right?\n\n183\n00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:52.474\nThis might help you, so\nIf I typed in the number 1,\n\n184\n00:10:52.474 --> 00:10:55.192\nJanuary 1st, 1900.\n\n185\n00:10:55.192 --> 00:10:59.746\nWhat if I typed in 2,\ntah-dah, 3, 4, well okay,\n\n186\n00:10:59.746 --> 00:11:03.510\nnow that just got to\nwhere it's a Wednesday.\n\n187\n00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:05.540\nYes, it's a lookup table.\n\n188\n00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:13.095\nBasically a lookup table for time and date\nthat is saying okay that's what we got,\n\n189\n00:11:13.095 --> 00:11:17.160\n5, 10, whoops that's 100, okay?\n\n190\n00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:21.470\n365, but it's 1901 January.\n\n191\n00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:22.260\nI was close.\n\n192\n00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.775\nYeah.\n[LAUGH] Actually that's a leap year,\n\n193\n00:11:24.775 --> 00:11:25.500\nso I was off.\n\n194\n00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.998\nYeah and that's how they accommodate for\nleap years and\n\n195\n00:11:28.998 --> 00:11:34.070\neverything is always like kind of,\nit's on that, it's the non-leap year.\n\n196\n00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:34.720\nYeah, that thing.\n\n197\n00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:40.430\nSo [LAUGH] that's what you've got going\non with the dates and how it understands.\n\n198\n00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:44.089\nSo but if I typed in 5000 and okay,\n\n199\n00:11:44.089 --> 00:11:48.730\nwell that's January 14th, the year 3271.\n\n200\n00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:53.202\nAll right, that's interesting, so\nit has this kind of built in as like,\n\n201\n00:11:53.202 --> 00:11:55.220\nthat's what the date is.\n\n202\n00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.876\nWhat if I put negative 1?\n\n203\n00:11:56.876 --> 00:11:58.900\nGood question, negative 1,\n\n204\n00:12:01.908 --> 00:12:06.840\nWhoops let's, come on, come on.\n\n205\n00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:07.562\nIt doesn't like that.\n\n206\n00:12:07.562 --> 00:12:10.115\n[LAUGH]\n[LAUGH] So\n\n207\n00:12:10.115 --> 00:12:14.555\nI figured this is the number of\ndays since January 1, 1900, right?\n\n208\n00:12:14.555 --> 00:12:16.938\nOr the number of days something.\n\n209\n00:12:16.938 --> 00:12:18.774\nAnd well.\n\n210\n00:12:18.774 --> 00:12:20.225\n[LAUGH] Yeah, it does not like that.\n\n211\n00:12:20.225 --> 00:12:22.550\nYou should see Vonne's face.\n\n212\n00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:24.750\nI know, I'm like,\nI've never done that before.\n\n213\n00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:26.323\nThat's why I'm just like, [NOISE].\n\n214\n00:12:26.323 --> 00:12:29.460\nSo I figured it was counting\nthe number of days, where January 1,\n\n215\n00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.410\n1900 was the first one and\nthen you counted up according.\n\n216\n00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:37.100\nNumber one that's kinda hard to read,\ncuzyou could always be off by one,\n\n217\n00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:41.080\ncuz the first day is January 1, 19,\nso it's not the number of days since.\n\n218\n00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.536\nIt starts counting up, so I misspoke.\n\n219\n00:12:43.536 --> 00:12:48.210\nCounting up January 1st, 1900,\nwhich is odd cuz if you do this and\n\n220\n00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:52.240\nneed like, 1800s, then I was like,\nyou can do negatives.\n\n221\n00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.198\nExcept you just end up\nwith a bunch of mess.\n\n222\n00:12:54.198 --> 00:12:56.110\n[LAUGH] Yeah, exactly.\n\n223\n00:12:56.110 --> 00:13:00.693\nSo now could I type in\n\n224\n00:13:00.693 --> 00:13:05.552\n1-1-1879?\n\n225\n00:13:05.552 --> 00:13:06.590\nWell, then it sees it as text,\nreally, cuz now look at it.\n\n226\n00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:10.630\nNow it's like, okay, well it's a date but\nit goes to the left, so\n\n227\n00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:11.940\nI mean that is a date.\n\n228\n00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:18.670\nBut it doesn't fall in line with 1-1-1,\nyou see?\n\n229\n00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:22.820\nSo because it doesn't really,\nit's a computer, you know?\n\n230\n00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:24.229\nIt doesn't see that,\n\n231\n00:13:24.229 --> 00:13:29.018\nso, here's another, [LAUGH] Justin's\nover here going like my gosh.\n\n232\n00:13:29.018 --> 00:13:31.930\nMan, this would be something that\nI would be yelling at my computer,\n\n233\n00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:33.449\nbe like why are you doing this to me?\n\n234\n00:13:33.449 --> 00:13:36.177\n[LAUGH] Especially if you're like\ndoing historical research or\n\n235\n00:13:36.177 --> 00:13:38.940\nsomething like that I'm trying\nto bring in to do data analysis.\n\n236\n00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:44.562\nYou can't do, 1800's didn't exist\napparently, according to Excel.\n\n237\n00:13:44.562 --> 00:13:46.791\n[LAUGH] Right?\nBased on these common lookup formats, or\n\n238\n00:13:46.791 --> 00:13:47.950\nthese common formats.\n\n239\n00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:52.844\nObviously there's a way to kind of coerce\nthem into that, but it doesn't quite\n\n240\n00:13:52.844 --> 00:13:57.520\nfollow my line of reasoning, and\nit might not follow yours as well.\n\n241\n00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:01.120\nAnd that's where if you\nwanted to be able to type in,\n\n242\n00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:05.920\nthis is where you'd have to have\nthat policy if you wanna say?\n\n243\n00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.940\nHey, we're gonna type it in like,\nI wanna type in,\n\n244\n00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:13.550\nyou're always gonna do a two digit month,\na two digit date or\n\n245\n00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:17.810\nday, and a four digit year,\nI could make a custom number format.\n\n246\n00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:22.310\nSo I could type in 01, 01, 1, 8, 7, 9.\n\n247\n00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:24.772\nAnd then it would represent the dashes and\n\n248\n00:14:24.772 --> 00:14:28.370\nthe slashes that we would\nunderstand that that's the date.\n\n249\n00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:33.368\nAnd you could also if you really wanted\nto, you could break it up into the column\n\n250\n00:14:33.368 --> 00:14:36.880\nis your month and\nyour other column is your date.\n\n251\n00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:40.090\nI mean, there's all sorts of ways, but\nagain, that's why you're gonna have to\n\n252\n00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:46.380\nunderstand how you need to have your\ndata stored in your Excel spreadsheet.\n\n253\n00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:47.553\nSo, but, good point,\n\n254\n00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:51.145\nI'm glad we tried this because I've\nactually never done the negative.\n\n255\n00:14:51.145 --> 00:14:53.961\n[LAUGH] In all these years of teaching,\nI've actually never done it.\n\n256\n00:14:53.961 --> 00:14:56.392\nSo you're actually seeing a first, people.\n\n257\n00:14:56.392 --> 00:14:58.320\n[LAUGH] We're breaking ground here.\n\n258\n00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.740\nYou really are.\nThere's no doubt about it.\n\n259\n00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:03.103\nBut this does actually throw back to a\nprevious episode where you saw numbers and\n\n260\n00:15:03.103 --> 00:15:07.275\ndates being converted, and you're like,\nwow, these numbers are the same.\n\n261\n00:15:07.275 --> 00:15:10.960\nWell we now know, that's the number\nof days, starting, right?\n\n262\n00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.782\nYou're counting up from January 1st,\n1900 and\n\n263\n00:15:13.782 --> 00:15:17.920\nthen that date that we saw in the very\nfirst introduction episode is actually,\n\n264\n00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:21.505\nthat's how many days have\nelapsed since January 1st, 1900.\n\n265\n00:15:21.505 --> 00:15:22.869\nSo wait, starting to.\n\n266\n00:15:22.869 --> 00:15:23.524\nRound about.\n\n267\n00:15:23.524 --> 00:15:25.429\n[LAUGH] Round, [NOISE].\n\n268\n00:15:25.429 --> 00:15:27.355\nSomewhere, right?\n\n269\n00:15:27.355 --> 00:15:31.290\nSo you're pulling the wool\nfrom over our eyes, Vonne.\n\n270\n00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:35.129\nYeah, I got more, so,\n[LAUGH] cuz we talked about that if\n\n271\n00:15:35.129 --> 00:15:39.461\nthis gets entered as text,\nthat could be like goodness, and\n\n272\n00:15:39.461 --> 00:15:44.260\nwell I have to have it as a date,\nI need that date format.\n\n273\n00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:48.391\nAnd this kind of wracked my brain for\na little while, and I'm like hm.\n\n274\n00:15:48.391 --> 00:15:50.950\nAnd I found something, so let me show you.\n\n275\n00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.775\nSo this might be helpful if\nthis ever happens to you,\n\n276\n00:15:53.775 --> 00:15:55.777\nlike when we had this as text, okay?\n\n277\n00:15:55.777 --> 00:15:57.940\nIt shows as a text.\n\n278\n00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.876\nI want this to be A date, okay?\n\n279\n00:16:00.876 --> 00:16:05.180\nAnd this, Mike and I had a field day\nwith this, cuz he's like no, no, no.\n\n280\n00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:05.997\nI'm like, no, you can't change this.\n\n281\n00:16:05.997 --> 00:16:07.090\nHe's like, yes you can.\n\n282\n00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:08.460\nI'm like, no you can't.\nAnd then I'm like,\n\n283\n00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.930\nhave you ever heard of\nthe date value function?\n\n284\n00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:11.982\nAnd he's like?\n\n285\n00:16:11.982 --> 00:16:17.218\nWe've both been teaching Excel for years,\nand it's just one, the date value,\n\n286\n00:16:17.218 --> 00:16:22.147\nthis is where, and this is not a show\nabout functions or anything like that.\n\n287\n00:16:22.147 --> 00:16:26.983\nI do have the websites up here, that's\nmy Finder, so that's not my website,\n\n288\n00:16:26.983 --> 00:16:28.815\nthat would be over here.\n\n289\n00:16:28.815 --> 00:16:33.304\n[LAUGH] That we have the convert\ndates stored as text to dates,\n\n290\n00:16:33.304 --> 00:16:37.365\nand that's where it shows\nyou a little bit about this.\n\n291\n00:16:37.365 --> 00:16:42.292\nThe format numbers as dates,\nthere's a bunch of stuff in here but,\n\n292\n00:16:42.292 --> 00:16:48.340\nto show you and explain what I did,\nthis is formatted as text, so we see this.\n\n293\n00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:54.063\nWhat you can do in the date value\nfunction, is you can say, all right,\n\n294\n00:16:54.063 --> 00:17:00.375\nuse this function to look at this cell\nin A1 and give me it as a number, right?\n\n295\n00:17:00.375 --> 00:17:04.691\nAnd in this number what I could\nthen do is I copied the values,\n\n296\n00:17:04.691 --> 00:17:09.856\njust the values, cuz if I copy this\nright now and then put this over here,\n\n297\n00:17:09.856 --> 00:17:14.505\nit's gonna try to do relative\nreference based on the function.\n\n298\n00:17:14.505 --> 00:17:18.740\nNo, you take this and\nyou just store it as your values only, and\n\n299\n00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.480\nonce I have it as a value, it's a number.\n\n300\n00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:25.090\nWe know about what this is, so\nthen I just this to a short date.\n\n301\n00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:29.952\nAnd then it shows me that it has a date,\nand so you can do it, and it did it.\n\n302\n00:17:29.952 --> 00:17:32.540\nAnd notice I type it in\na couple different ways, right?\n\n303\n00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:38.820\nWith the 2s and the 4s and\nthe dashes and the slashes, it did it.\n\n304\n00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:42.620\nSo that was pretty cool, so\nI wanted to throw that out to you and\n\n305\n00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:46.770\ngive you that information.\n\n306\n00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:47.530\nThis happened,\n\n307\n00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:52.060\nI think we're taking it out of one custom\nplatform that we do to track things.\n\n308\n00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:56.000\nAnd it was bringing it out as text cuz\nshe you brought it into Excel as text,\n\n309\n00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.900\nand that's why she couldn't recognize it.\n\n310\n00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.740\nSo the moral of the story,\n\n311\n00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:05.902\nit has to be in its base value,\nif you wanna say,\n\n312\n00:18:05.902 --> 00:18:11.467\nin as a date it could do\nany date number formatting.\n\n313\n00:18:11.467 --> 00:18:15.100\nIt's a little confusing, and\nthe same will go for time.\n\n314\n00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:18.640\nIt has like a certain pattern, okay?\n\n315\n00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.707\nTime is one that throws me off,\nI will just tell you that right now.\n\n316\n00:18:21.707 --> 00:18:27.762\nI'm sure, your eyes just got big over\nthere Justin because it's hairy.\n\n317\n00:18:27.762 --> 00:18:30.239\n[LAUGH] It can get a little hairy, and\n\n318\n00:18:30.239 --> 00:18:35.440\nI'm sure I'm gonna throw some curve balls,\nlow and outside that are gonna come up.\n\n319\n00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:39.593\nNot intentionally, just because I have\nmessed in my programming experience with\n\n320\n00:18:39.593 --> 00:18:40.503\ndates and times.\n\n321\n00:18:40.503 --> 00:18:44.310\nAnd well, they can actually be\nthe bane of your existence.\n\n322\n00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:45.603\nYou're like, wait a minute,\nthat's not right.\n\n323\n00:18:45.603 --> 00:18:50.529\nBut I do want to emphasize that that\ndate value gives you that day count, or\n\n324\n00:18:50.529 --> 00:18:52.810\nsome numeric count.\n\n325\n00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:55.450\nWhen you're working on\ncomputers with dates,\n\n326\n00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:58.816\nit is always reduced to a number\nthat it references, dates or\n\n327\n00:18:58.816 --> 00:19:01.986\ntimes that are referenced\nagainst some previous [SOUND].\n\n328\n00:19:01.986 --> 00:19:04.210\nWe're gonna start here, right?\n\n329\n00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:07.870\nSo for instance, our number system\nstarts at zero and we start counting up.\n\n330\n00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:09.210\nWell why is it that case?\n\n331\n00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:12.720\nWell we said zero is nothing,\nand then you start adding to it.\n\n332\n00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:17.060\nIt is by not only convention but\nby construction.\n\n333\n00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:20.176\nEven our calendars, actually I think\nwe can select different calendars.\n\n334\n00:19:20.176 --> 00:19:24.880\nFor the most part you have no reason to\nselect anything other than Gregorian.\n\n335\n00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.999\nBut if you do and that changes,\nbecause the reference values and\n\n336\n00:19:28.999 --> 00:19:33.043\nhow those are counted do change,\nthey're still numbers, but\n\n337\n00:19:33.043 --> 00:19:35.196\nyou just have to be aware of that.\n\n338\n00:19:35.196 --> 00:19:39.260\nYeah, that's a great point, yeah,\nwhere do you start counting from?\n\n339\n00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:44.870\nIt's funny because in a former life\nI was in a band and we did this weird\n\n340\n00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:48.240\ntime signature that it wasn't in fours and\nour drummer was having a really hard time.\n\n341\n00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:52.279\nSo I said so do those zero, one, two,\nthree, four, zero, and so we name the song\n\n342\n00:19:52.279 --> 00:19:56.052\ncounting from zero because [LAUGH] he\ncouldn't count in anything but fours.\n\n343\n00:19:56.052 --> 00:19:59.846\nBut it's all relative where\nyou are counting from, and\n\n344\n00:19:59.846 --> 00:20:02.356\nit has to have that pattern, right?\n\n345\n00:20:02.356 --> 00:20:07.095\nAnd the same thing goes with the time,\nit has to have a certain pattern for\n\n346\n00:20:07.095 --> 00:20:11.310\nit to work the way you think\nit's supposed to work.\n\n347\n00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:14.230\nIt's very helpful, but\nit can't do everything.\n\n348\n00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:17.907\nSo here in these blue cells,\nright over here, see that?\n\n349\n00:20:17.907 --> 00:20:19.440\nThat's 5:00 PM isn't it?\n\n350\n00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:25.720\nThis is 12:00 AM, and this is,\nthese are all formatted as time.\n\n351\n00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.974\nSo I'm gonna just take these,\nI'm gonna clear these out first, so\n\n352\n00:20:27.974 --> 00:20:29.570\nthese are times, right?\n\n353\n00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:34.412\nSo if it's 4:00 PM, that worked,\n\n354\n00:20:34.412 --> 00:20:38.386\nso what I did, 4, space, PM.\n\n355\n00:20:38.386 --> 00:20:42.650\nIf I did 4PM,\nthat doesn't like it does it, okay?\n\n356\n00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:48.250\nAnd then if I did 2:30,\nwell is that AM or PM?\n\n357\n00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:52.673\nSo it's like, [LAUGH] you're\nstill gonna have to type it in.\n\n358\n00:20:52.673 --> 00:21:00.846\nYou're still gonna have to type in 1\ncolon 45 space PM, and then it does it.\n\n359\n00:21:00.846 --> 00:21:07.410\nCuz if you typed in 1:45am,\ndoesn't like that either, so.\n\n360\n00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:09.850\nOkay first question Vonne,\nand times are fun.\n\n361\n00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:12.590\nWhat if I did 13:45 without the AM or PM?\n\n362\n00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:16.572\nDo I get 1:45 AM or PM,\nmilitary time, right?\n\n363\n00:21:16.572 --> 00:21:21.177\nA base 24 time, and\nnow if you use that time you get the AM or\n\n364\n00:21:21.177 --> 00:21:23.770\nPM for free based on this format.\n\n365\n00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:29.000\nSo 23:15, that would be 11:15- 11:15,\nat night.\n\n366\n00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.026\nYes, you can.\nBoom, so\n\n367\n00:21:30.026 --> 00:21:34.108\nthat is one way around that if you're\ncomfortable using 24 hour time.\n\n368\n00:21:34.108 --> 00:21:37.584\nAnd I'm not good at it.\n\n369\n00:21:37.584 --> 00:21:42.412\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] So okay, so 6 plus 12, so\n\n370\n00:21:42.412 --> 00:21:48.674\nthat's 18, so 18:30 would be 6:30.\n\n371\n00:21:48.674 --> 00:21:51.758\nI have to really think and\ndo your math, and\n\n372\n00:21:51.758 --> 00:21:56.320\nas you can see [LAUGH] I'm not so\ngood with the math in the noggin.\n\n373\n00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:00.860\nSo if I took all this, that is a good\npoint, so if I select these cells,\n\n374\n00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:04.800\nyou think there's probably an option\nto change into military time, right?\n\n375\n00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.360\nYeah exactly, so just like our dates,\n\n376\n00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:11.990\nwith the time look at all of these\ndifferent formats that we can have.\n\n377\n00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:17.136\nAnd so you could you put in, all right\nthis is, that would be military, right?\n\n378\n00:22:17.136 --> 00:22:19.020\nBecause that's 13, mm-hm.\n\n379\n00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:21.775\nSo if I click, and it's got the seconds,\ndo I really need the seconds?\n\n380\n00:22:21.775 --> 00:22:23.798\nLet's just go with that one, right?\n\n381\n00:22:23.798 --> 00:22:29.040\nSo we'll click OK, and then, it goes\nahead and switches it, there we go.\n\n382\n00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.103\nBut since this is a date, okay?\n\n383\n00:22:31.103 --> 00:22:35.866\nAnd I change this back to a long\ndate format, this isn't on a date,\n\n384\n00:22:35.866 --> 00:22:39.490\nwe're talking about time, sorry guys.\n\n385\n00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:42.635\nSo if I take it to there,\nthen it will flip.\n\n386\n00:22:42.635 --> 00:22:48.740\nBut, that could very easily be\ntyped in as text couldn't it?\n\n387\n00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:52.070\nYeah, and if it's text, we already\nrealized it's not gonna work that way.\n\n388\n00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:56.350\nSo just the same way with here,\nit's typed in all sorts of different ways,\n\n389\n00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:59.970\nI could say, yes, go ahead and\neverybody be a time.\n\n390\n00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:06.640\nThe only one that changed was in that\nkind of pattern that it could recognize\n\n391\n00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:10.600\nthat, we're both times,\nI'll go ahead and switch you.\n\n392\n00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:16.350\nSo these are the ones, it's not gonna\nchange over, not gonna be annoying, so.\n\n393\n00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:18.490\nNow Vonne, I think I already know\nthe answer to this question but\n\n394\n00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:19.494\nI'm gonna ask it anyway.\n\n395\n00:23:19.494 --> 00:23:24.013\nThese are time zone ignorant, right?\n\n396\n00:23:24.013 --> 00:23:27.590\nThese do not account for\ntime zones respectively.\n\n397\n00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:32.090\nEssentially when we talk about time,\nwe're usually locale specific, but\n\n398\n00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:34.790\nif you're doing scientific measurements or\nglobal measurements or\n\n399\n00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:39.190\nsetting global style meetings,\ntime zones do become important.\n\n400\n00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:41.390\nDoesn't look like these account for\nthat, right?\n\n401\n00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:45.230\nNot to my knowledge,\nit's kinda just like Excel\n\n402\n00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:49.130\nnot doing our exchange rates\non a currency or anything.\n\n403\n00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:53.130\nOr it's just like hey,\nI can only do what you tell me to do and\n\n404\n00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:56.107\nif you're wanting to put it in GMT, right?\n\n405\n00:23:56.107 --> 00:23:58.060\nGreenwich Mean Time.\n\n406\n00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:02.493\nOr UTC, one of the One of the things we\nsaw in that article is that ISO 8601.\n\n407\n00:24:02.493 --> 00:24:06.487\nWhich is a very specific date and time,\n\n408\n00:24:06.487 --> 00:24:11.680\ndate and time that is UTC so\nuniversal time code.\n\n409\n00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:14.590\nSo I think it is the same as GMT.\n\n410\n00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:17.130\nWe're, hey, we're measuring it\nfrom this place on the Earth.\n\n411\n00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:19.200\nAnd then you have a respective offset.\n\n412\n00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:19.790\nYes.\nYes,\n\n413\n00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:24.540\nthat's what I always remember is\nthe international date line, the GMT and\n\n414\n00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:25.430\nit's right down that.\n\n415\n00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:27.130\nThat's what I remember in school.\n\n416\n00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:32.230\nSo I was an art major too, so I I kind\nof went this way instead of that way.\n\n417\n00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:37.150\nWhen we're talking about math and science\nand pretty colors, things like that.\n\n418\n00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:38.930\nSo that's what we've got going on there.\n\n419\n00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:41.550\nBut yes it is something\nthat will throw you off.\n\n420\n00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:45.709\nIf you're not understanding why won't\nthese all just convert over to a time and\n\n421\n00:24:45.709 --> 00:24:47.630\nall look the same.\n\n422\n00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:48.510\nIt doesn't see it that way.\n\n423\n00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:52.340\nYou gotta have the pattern,\nyou gotta have the input value.\n\n424\n00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:55.876\nAnd I hope these, because I mean\nthat's pretty much all I have\n\n425\n00:24:55.876 --> 00:24:59.220\nto say about time in a sense\nthat like you can pre-format.\n\n426\n00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:03.090\nBut you still got to enter it into\na way that everyone understands it.\n\n427\n00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:07.280\nThis is about reoccurring theme\nthrough all of our little mini series,\n\n428\n00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.420\nwe've had these number formats.\n\n429\n00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.450\nAnd this is why I wanted to break it out.\n\n430\n00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:13.660\nTo make it a little,\nlike really drive home the point.\n\n431\n00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:17.260\nAnd make it really clear\nthat this is [LAUGH]\n\n432\n00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:19.890\nthis isn't as clear as it may seem.\n\n433\n00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:24.420\nIt's not as straightforward and\nit's a lot of weird nuances.\n\n434\n00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:28.390\nAnd I'm really glad that we paired up\nwith these different perspectives.\n\n435\n00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:29.480\nCuz it can,\n\n436\n00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:33.200\nit's different coming from somebody\nfrom my background and your background.\n\n437\n00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:36.860\nIt absolutely is, and\nwe have sometime have biases.\n\n438\n00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.714\nBut it's sometimes good to see\ntwo sides of the story and\n\n439\n00:25:39.714 --> 00:25:41.240\nto form your own third story.\n\n440\n00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:45.370\nI do have a final question,\nI noticed in our time format.\n\n441\n00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:49.580\nWhen we actually selected time\nformat there was actually a date and\n\n442\n00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:50.970\ntime together.\n\n443\n00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:53.220\nWhat happens if we take our time and\n\n444\n00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:56.300\napply that format to\nsomething that was just time?\n\n445\n00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.620\nAt that particular instant.\n\n446\n00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:00.820\nWhy don't we find out? Yeah.\nAll right, let's try it.\n\n447\n00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:01.810\nLet's come back into here.\n\n448\n00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:03.340\nI've, so these are just times.\n\n449\n00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:07.150\nBut, and we know that it is\nin a time pattern, right?\n\n450\n00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:11.010\nSo if you come into here and\nwe went into, it was in here, right?\n\n451\n00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:12.750\nAnd then down here?\n\n452\n00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:13.370\nYup.\n\n453\n00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:14.460\nThat one right there.\n\n454\n00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:14.960\nLet's see.\n\n455\n00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:21.080\nIt's zero, zero, it's 1900.\n\n456\n00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.040\nOkay.\n\n457\n00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.150\nWow, but it's the zero.\n\n458\n00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:25.970\nIt's January zero.\n\n459\n00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:28.450\nIsn't that our Jatober?\n\n460\n00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:29.630\nIsn't that what we name it?\n\n461\n00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:31.190\nJafebruary and Septober.\n\n462\n00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:32.670\nYes.\nYeah,\n\n463\n00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:34.780\nwe had some shenanigans between the show.\n\n464\n00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:38.020\nBut it was interesting because\na lot of time, we think of time and\n\n465\n00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:39.630\ndates as separate entities.\n\n466\n00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:43.240\nBut really they're just two\nsides of the same coin, right?\n\n467\n00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:47.810\nSo at 3 o'clock today it's\nstill at 3 o'clock today.\n\n468\n00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:53.270\nWhich is a significant, some portion\nof time, since some previous Time.\n\n469\n00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:57.070\nCan we go to the date formatting there?\n\n470\n00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:59.135\nYou're like no Justin, no.\n\n471\n00:26:59.135 --> 00:27:01.770\n[LAUGH] If we go to the date format for\nthose respective places.\n\n472\n00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:03.120\nRight here?\n\n473\n00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:03.730\nYeah.\n\n474\n00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:04.810\nOkay.\nHold on lets select these.\n\n475\n00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:08.660\nAnd that's funny because we selected\nthat from the time dropdown.\n\n476\n00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:10.848\nIf you look that actually\nsays thats a date.\n\n477\n00:27:10.848 --> 00:27:13.040\n[CROSSTALK] from the drop-down.\n\n478\n00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:13.950\nRight here?\n\n479\n00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:14.800\nYeah.\nUh-huh?\n\n480\n00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:18.600\nLet's go select it from the date, and\nsee if it applies anything differently.\n\n481\n00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:22.920\nSo if we go to more number formats,\nand then we go to the date.\n\n482\n00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:25.030\nAnd then, it already re-selected.\n\n483\n00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:28.640\nSo we selected it from the Time menu,\nand it applied it Yes.\n\n484\n00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:30.150\nFrom there.\n\n485\n00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:33.530\nI was doing these over here,\nremember the ones that we had.\n\n486\n00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:37.980\nAnd I took out the really\nlong values just for fun.\n\n487\n00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:42.390\nSo we took this, and let me just delete\nthose so we don't get confusing.\n\n488\n00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:47.760\nSo those have a just a date, we come\nback over to here and we go to time.\n\n489\n00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:49.400\nThat's sorry.\n\n490\n00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.440\nGotta go to more number formats first.\n\n491\n00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:56.240\nAnd then we go over to time and\nthen we scroll down to these.\n\n492\n00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:01.780\nSo there you go, it's just 12 AM for\neach one of them.\n\n493\n00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.570\nIt just added it.\n\n494\n00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:05.880\nThat went really weird didn't it?\n\n495\n00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:11.650\nBecause that's not Wait no,\n1990, sorry, okay.\n\n496\n00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:12.865\nI forgot what was in there.\n\n497\n00:28:12.865 --> 00:28:17.950\n[LAUGH] So yeah, it just added\n12 AM to all of the dates there.\n\n498\n00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:18.830\nAnd that makes sense.\n\n499\n00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:21.910\nI have one final question,\nI promise I'm done after this.\n\n500\n00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:25.600\nIf we come back to our original formatting\nwhere we have date, month, year, right?\n\n501\n00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:29.210\nThe red, the pinkish Over here?\n\n502\n00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:30.230\nYep.\nMm-hm.\n\n503\n00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:38.233\nIf in that one free box,\nlet's type 1/1/01, space, 13:45.\n\n504\n00:28:40.888 --> 00:28:44.970\nOkay, so now let's change that date.\n\n505\n00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:46.720\nWe'll change all three of those just for\nfun.\n\n506\n00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:47.270\nYep.\n\n507\n00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:50.070\nOkay, we'll go under More Number Formats.\n\n508\n00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:52.270\nAnd we'll go to.\n\n509\n00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:53.300\nLet's add a time to it.\n\n510\n00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:53.880\nThis one?\n\n511\n00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:54.380\nYep.\nOkay.\n\n512\n00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:58.558\nAnd now that information is preserved.\n\n513\n00:28:58.558 --> 00:29:01.039\n[SOUND] [SOUND] [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n514\n00:29:01.039 --> 00:29:03.980\nthese are the things\nthat I've struggled with.\n\n515\n00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:06.560\nSo this is why I'm asking\na series of questions.\n\n516\n00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:10.890\nBecause a lot of times you have a date and\na time respective within that day.\n\n517\n00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:12.060\nThat you need to keep track of.\n\n518\n00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:14.480\nAnd then if you don't have that,\n\n519\n00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.880\nthe assumption is you start at 12 AM,\nwhich is it applying.\n\n520\n00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.120\nAnd if you do have that,\nmaybe it's not displayed.\n\n521\n00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:23.840\nBut it's still kept as kind of a,\nI wouldn't call it metadata,\n\n522\n00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.750\nbut hidden data based on the display type.\n\n523\n00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:30.370\nBack into, what did you input,\nversus what's\n\n524\n00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:34.920\nthe raw data versus the formatting, yeah.\n\n525\n00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:39.410\nAnd they are two separate things,\nthey are separate, but they are together.\n\n526\n00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:41.310\nAnd is it in there, is it not in there?\n\n527\n00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:44.050\nAnd I was playing around while\nyou were talking, because yeah,\n\n528\n00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:46.710\nit's It is one of those things, yeah.\n\n529\n00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:50.720\nThat's why we did an entire episode\nby itself on date and time.\n\n530\n00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.980\nSo if you've been struggling with this,\nhopefully this is.\n\n531\n00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:59.090\nWe had a nice little experiment, back and\nforth of just say, hey do this, do that.\n\n532\n00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:00.450\nThat's how it goes.\n\n533\n00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:01.530\nAnd that's how you learn it.\n\n534\n00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:02.730\nThat's really.\n\n535\n00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:03.700\nWe've just been playing around.\n\n536\n00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:06.970\nLike I said, I've been teaching this for\na long time.\n\n537\n00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:10.930\nBut two different sides of the coin can\ngive you lots of good perspectives.\n\n538\n00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:13.480\nSo do you have any other questions?\n\n539\n00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:14.130\nI think I'm done.\n\n540\n00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:15.170\nOkay are you sure?\n\n541\n00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:18.234\nYep.\nOkay all right then we're gonna go ahead\n\n542\n00:30:18.234 --> 00:30:21.040\nand hopefully say I hope you enjoyed this.\n\n543\n00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:23.460\nAnd I'll let you close the show\ncuz you're the host sorry.\n\n544\n00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:25.670\nAll right well I guess\nI need to go ahead and\n\n545\n00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:28.790\ntake the heat of the closing arguments.\n\n546\n00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:30.380\nAnd, well, thank you so much, Vonne.\n\n547\n00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:31.720\nHopefully, you learned something.\n\n548\n00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:35.340\nDates and times are not as\neasy as they initially appear,\n\n549\n00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:36.400\nbe careful with formatting.\n\n550\n00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.680\nYou can lose information,\nyou can gain information or\n\n551\n00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.450\nyou're gonna have wrong information.\n\n552\n00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:42.440\nSo, just keep a sharp eye on this.\n\n553\n00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.760\nEveryone, thank you for\njoining us in these miniseries.\n\n554\n00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:46.150\nBut we're going to go and wrap it up.\n\n555\n00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:49.160\nSo, signing off for OfficePro.TV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n556\n00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:49.920\nAnd, I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n557\n00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:56.853\nAnd we'll see you next time.\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:20.532\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison, and we're\ncarrying on with our Excel 2016 Essentials\n\n4\n00:00:20.532 --> 00:00:25.740\nfor Mac series, and we're gonna be\nlooking at proof, print, and page layout.\n\n5\n00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.500\nThat was a lot p's, scares me when\nI have alliteration like that.\n\n6\n00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.070\nBut luckily we have someone who knows all\nabout those topics, and I'm gonna to try\n\n7\n00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.210\nto keep her under control today cuz I have\na feeling these are geek out moments.\n\n8\n00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.970\nThe one, the only, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.716\nHow are you doing today, Vonne?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing pretty good and\n\n10\n00:00:41.716 --> 00:00:46.242\nI do love me a triplet, so [LAUGH] I\nlove to put three things together and\n\n11\n00:00:46.242 --> 00:00:51.410\nput some Oxford commas in there and\neverything because it just makes me happy.\n\n12\n00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.268\nAnd I'd love to just say, I have to\nlook at my notes again, proof, print,\n\n13\n00:00:55.268 --> 00:00:56.750\nand page late, what?\n\n14\n00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.520\nPage layout, my.\n\n15\n00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.070\nI ruined my own like joke or whatever.\n\n16\n00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.550\nI don't know if that was a joke.\n\n17\n00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.125\nAnyways, this stuff is\nactually not a joke.\n\n18\n00:01:06.125 --> 00:01:11.680\n[LAUGH] It can send you into a tizzy,\nI will tell you that right now.\n\n19\n00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.410\nIt does to me, still to this day,\ntrying to print out an Excel sheet.\n\n20\n00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.250\nJustin, have you ever had some\nfun printing out an Excel\n\n21\n00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.040\nsheet?\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes it almost feels like I'm\n\n22\n00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.650\ntrying to print out a poster that's on\nmultiple pages, and then you do that thing\n\n23\n00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.060\nwhere you're like well I've already\nprinted these, 45 pages of them.\n\n24\n00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.950\nI'm going to figure out how to cut\nthem up and tape them together.\n\n25\n00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.700\nWhen really all you needed was these\ncouple of columns and this other things.\n\n26\n00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.310\nSo, I've had some rough times\nwith Excel and printing.\n\n27\n00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.800\nMy default action nowadays is,\ndon't print at all.\n\n28\n00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.190\nBut if I absolutely have to,\nI do get a little like sweaty.\n\n29\n00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.906\nI'm like I don't know, I'm scared.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, me too.\n\n30\n00:01:55.906 --> 00:01:59.280\nSo [LAUGH] I mean, and\nI know this stuff and\n\n31\n00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.200\nI know some tricks and\nit still throws me off.\n\n32\n00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.650\nSo if you feel that way, I feel you.\n\n33\n00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.180\nSo hopefully I'll try to make it\na little easier for us today, we'll see.\n\n34\n00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.940\nSo, and it's really kinda hard to\nseparate all this stuff out, so\n\n35\n00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.820\nthat's why I kinda lumped it all together,\nit's like what we're doing at the end.\n\n36\n00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.285\nIf I do have a need to print this out,\nor even to just send it off to somebody,\n\n37\n00:02:23.285 --> 00:02:26.260\nproofing's always a really\ngood place to start, okay.\n\n38\n00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.910\nSo I am not a good speller,\nI will tell you that right now.\n\n39\n00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.080\nAnd if it wasn't those auto corrects and\nthose little,\n\n40\n00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.340\nhey you made a spelling mistake,\nit would be pretty bad.\n\n41\n00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.482\nSo why don't we go ahead and get started.\n\n42\n00:02:38.482 --> 00:02:41.570\nI have a file that is called page layout.\n\n43\n00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:42.100\nSounds good.\n\n44\n00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.280\nGot a couple things,\n\n45\n00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.830\nseems like we've been looking at these\nChristmas cats all this whole series.\n\n46\n00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.696\nAnd if you're looking right up there,\nwhat does that say there Justin?\n\n47\n00:02:52.696 --> 00:02:53.915\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] As soon as you said that I was\n\n48\n00:02:53.915 --> 00:02:55.230\nlike, that's not what that says.\n\n49\n00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.228\nThat says cots.\n\n50\n00:02:57.228 --> 00:03:00.250\nThat a is wrong.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now is cots,\n\n51\n00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.227\nis that how you spell cots?\n&gt;&gt; I believe,yeah, the little fold out\n\n52\n00:03:04.227 --> 00:03:07.320\nbed that is really uncomfortable\nif you're a man of my stature.\n\n53\n00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.610\nYeah, it's how you spell it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n54\n00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.215\nthat's not gonna come up\nin our spell check, is it?\n\n55\n00:03:12.215 --> 00:03:13.060\nMm-hm.\n\n56\n00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.817\nSo right off the bat, before we go\nahead and tell you about spell check,\n\n57\n00:03:16.817 --> 00:03:17.832\nproofing, okay.\n\n58\n00:03:17.832 --> 00:03:22.015\nYou need to proofread everything because\n\n59\n00:03:22.015 --> 00:03:27.040\nsomething like Christmas cots or\nwhat week is it?\n\n60\n00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.060\nWell, not that week.\n\n61\n00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.300\nWe need the other week.\n\n62\n00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.880\nSo this is something you\nalways need to be very,\n\n63\n00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.960\nvery aware of before you do\nany type if spellcheck, okay.\n\n64\n00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.960\nAlways read your,\ndon't rely on spellcheck alone.\n\n65\n00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.145\nNow spell checking, and\nthis is also Excel, okay.\n\n66\n00:03:44.145 --> 00:03:49.410\nIf we're doing expense reports, how much\nspell checking are you gonna need to do?\n\n67\n00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.100\nIt depends.\n\n68\n00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.440\nIt's for\nall different reasons of why we use Excel.\n\n69\n00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.560\nI'm just going to show you a little\nbehind the scenes of when we're\n\n70\n00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.550\ndoing our episode notes and everything.\n\n71\n00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.630\nI keep everything in an Excel sheet for\nevery episode that I do and\n\n72\n00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.280\nI put the episode descriptions in here.\n\n73\n00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.810\nSo this is a lot of text.\n\n74\n00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:08.460\nSo you know what I do?\n\n75\n00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.510\nI make sure I have proofread and\nthen I go ahead and\n\n76\n00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.060\nspell check to make sure\nthat I've got everything.\n\n77\n00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.840\nSo that's something that, yeah, it really\ndepends on what type of information that\n\n78\n00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.740\nyou're going to be storing\nin Excel as whether or\n\n79\n00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.070\nnot you need to do a spell check.\n&gt;&gt; Well I will tell you,\n\n80\n00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.910\nVonne, seeing that spreadsheet with that\nmuch organization made me uncomfortable.\n\n81\n00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.230\nBut on a different note, people are like,\n\n82\n00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.080\nwe're talking about expense reports or\nsomething.\n\n83\n00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.110\nI will tell you, being someone who's been\nhanded a P&amp;L before or an expense report,\n\n84\n00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.020\nif it's full of typos then\nI automatically have a,\n\n85\n00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.650\nI wonder how valid or accurate this is.\n\n86\n00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.720\nIf you're not taking enough time\nto double check spelling or\n\n87\n00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.630\nthe usage of a word like week,\nthat's not the right week, right.\n\n88\n00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.490\nOne or two here or there, but\nif it's riddled with them,\n\n89\n00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.160\nnow I'm gonna come behind you and\nI'm gonna double check, and\n\n90\n00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.100\nI'm gonna make sure that the numbers that\nyou're telling me are actually vetted,\n\n91\n00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.780\nbecause you're not vetting the vocabulary\nor anything of that nature,\n\n92\n00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.800\nso.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a really good point and\n\n93\n00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.870\nI can tell you I've sent out some\nemails where you go back and\n\n94\n00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.190\nread it again, I've checked and\nchecked and I'm like.\n\n95\n00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.770\nMy gosh, I just sent that to that director\nand that director, and that makes me look\n\n96\n00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:23.230\nreally bad cuz I used the wrong context,\nthe word or something like that.\n\n97\n00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.760\nI know we've all done it but,\nyeah, make sure you check.\n\n98\n00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.250\nHow do I do a spell check?\n\n99\n00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.580\nIt's pretty easy and it's kinda the same\nin all of your Office products.\n\n100\n00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.100\nI'm gonna go to the Tools menu because\nthat's where I like to go within\n\n101\n00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.612\nthe MacOS.\n\n102\n00:05:35.612 --> 00:05:37.120\nI'll just go to Tools and\nI go to Spelling.\n\n103\n00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.560\nDo take notice of where my cursor is\nbecause where your cursor is where it's\n\n104\n00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.610\ngonna start your spellcheck.\n\n105\n00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.466\nFor example, let me go down here.\n\n106\n00:05:44.466 --> 00:05:48.790\nIf I'm in a blank cell that on my\nworksheet and then I go to Spelling,\n\n107\n00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.840\nit's going to first of all say, hey, well,\ndo you want me to start at the beginning?\n\n108\n00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.310\nSo if you started in the middle,\nthat's where it's gonna start.\n\n109\n00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.570\nAnd you'll probably get a warning\nthat says, hey, let me go ahead and\n\n110\n00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.310\nback up to the beginning to go ahead and\nstart the spellcheck.\n\n111\n00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.730\nSo that's what that little warning is\nsaying, in case you can't read it.\n\n112\n00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.080\nIt's just asking about\ngoing to the beginning.\n\n113\n00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.100\nSo I come up to say yes, I want to,\nand it's gonna go through and\n\n114\n00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.900\nsystematically check things.\n\n115\n00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.350\nThis is another thing,\nyou've got to be careful.\n\n116\n00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.070\nOkay, Pooma that is how\nwe spell Pooma's name.\n\n117\n00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:17.335\nIt is not Pooja.\n\n118\n00:06:17.335 --> 00:06:22.460\n[LAUGH] So\nthis is where you got to kind of know,\n\n119\n00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.610\ndo I really want to have it this way?\n\n120\n00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.720\nSo you have a couple different\noptions in your spell check.\n\n121\n00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.780\nDo you want to ignore it?\n\n122\n00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.560\nDo you want to change it?\n\n123\n00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:40.160\nAnd okay, hey, I need to, you know what,\nPooma is correct, I want to add it.\n\n124\n00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.364\nWell they use different options\ncuz when you're spell checking,\n\n125\n00:06:43.364 --> 00:06:46.920\nit's using the Office dictionary,\nthe thing kind of behind the scenes.\n\n126\n00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.599\nActually right here, you can see adding\nto this particular file that is used for\n\n127\n00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:55.030\nyour library in your Office suite.\n\n128\n00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.880\nYou can add it, oops sorry I didn't mean\nto change that, I didn't want to change.\n\n129\n00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.160\nI will, sorry I clicked too much,\nI'm just gonna ignore it.\n\n130\n00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.690\nBut the add, like my name, okay, I always\nhave to add that to the dictionary.\n\n131\n00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:11.480\nOr maybe like ITProTV, OfficeProTV,\nDevProTV, all those things that I'm going\n\n132\n00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.780\nto be using a lot in my documents,\nyou might wanna go ahead and add it so\n\n133\n00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:19.730\nit doesn't keep thinking\nthat it needs correction.\n\n134\n00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.070\nSo that's always a nice thing.\n\n135\n00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:27.470\nIt's always gonna give you suggestions,\nso none of these are what I want.\n\n136\n00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:28.586\nI'm going to ignore.\n\n137\n00:07:28.586 --> 00:07:32.303\nDo I want to ignore it once or\ndo I wanna ignore all of it?\n\n138\n00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.273\nI know that Pooma's in here a couple\nmore times, so I'm just gonna say,\n\n139\n00:07:37.273 --> 00:07:39.380\ndon't even check this, we're good.\n\n140\n00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:44.480\nI'm going to go ahead and\nclick Ignore All, and then it moves on.\n\n141\n00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.420\nSo here's another one\nnot in the dictionary.\n\n142\n00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.646\nTools, toils, no it's totals.\n\n143\n00:07:51.646 --> 00:07:56.580\nThis is one where I've spelled words so\nwrong I don't even get a suggestion and\n\n144\n00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.470\nI'm kind of relying on that.\n\n145\n00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:04.070\nDidn't even have a clue to how to\nstart to spell it, so I'm kinda lost.\n\n146\n00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:07.070\nI love those [INAUDIBLE].\n&gt;&gt; Well Vonne, I 'll take it a victory.\n\n147\n00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:11.840\nIf I can somehow misspell\na word poorly enough.\n\n148\n00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.721\nThat several million dollars worth\nof technology can't even get close.\n\n149\n00:08:14.721 --> 00:08:15.475\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n150\n00:08:15.475 --> 00:08:17.950\n&gt;&gt; Hey, toils, no, no, no, no.\n\n151\n00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:21.450\nIt's not totals,\nthat's on me and it's like aah.\n\n152\n00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:25.110\nSo it's all about perpective Vonne.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I like that,\n\n153\n00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:26.830\nI'm just gonna try and break the system.\n\n154\n00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:32.457\nSo, and so now I know that is incorrect,\nand it also showing me like back out here.\n\n155\n00:08:32.457 --> 00:08:34.960\nLike where in the worksheet I am at.\n\n156\n00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.320\nSo maybe you can get a little\nperspective like I don't.\n\n157\n00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.550\nMaybe that was suppose to be\na toads [INAUDIBLE] you know.\n\n158\n00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:44.490\nSo I do what toils, totals [LAUGH].\n\n159\n00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:49.070\nSo I've come down here to my suggestions\nwhich I do have as always suggest\n\n160\n00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:51.890\nand I will change it.\n\n161\n00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:55.340\nChange versus change all I'm going to\ngo ahead and click change for this one.\n\n162\n00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.905\nOkay, weekly is misspelled and\nonce you get the hang of it.\n\n163\n00:08:58.905 --> 00:09:00.630\naad you know how this goes this is ones.\n\n164\n00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.250\nWhere I just kind of go click,\nclick, click, click.\n\n165\n00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.150\nAnd I just go really fast,\nbut again be careful.\n\n166\n00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:08.100\nLike the toils and\nthe toads and the totals.\n\n167\n00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:14.220\nBe aware and really do take time to be\nlike, that's supposed to be weekly.\n\n168\n00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.700\nNotice not the WEA.\n\n169\n00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.630\nI will change, keeps on going.\n\n170\n00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:24.410\nOkay, now this is coming over here\nto this merge sale, so not sals.\n\n171\n00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:29.000\nOkay we're not talking about sales,\ngrocery or what have you.\n\n172\n00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.990\nChange, okay now this is\nsomething right here.\n\n173\n00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:35.270\nThis is talking about the citric trimmer.\n\n174\n00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:40.050\nThe citric trimmer is an actual machinery\nthat they use in Print production.\n\n175\n00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:42.590\nTo where stitches and trims books.\n\n176\n00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:44.920\nSo that is an actual thing,\nit's not stitchery.\n\n177\n00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.800\nSo I would again ignore once.\n\n178\n00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.100\nAnd that says, hey you're good to go.\n\n179\n00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.475\nThanks for the vote of confidence,\nyou click okay.\n\n180\n00:09:52.475 --> 00:09:53.362\nAnd there you go.\n\n181\n00:09:53.362 --> 00:09:57.510\nBut again, we would definitely come\nback in here, change this to week.\n\n182\n00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:02.240\nTake out the cots and\nturn it to cats and there we go.\n\n183\n00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.490\nSo definitely proof, use your spellcheck.\n\n184\n00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:07.520\nThe other think, for example on this one,\n\n185\n00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:13.130\nI don't want it to check the spelling\nof the file names a lot of times.\n\n186\n00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:17.040\nI'm just gonna have to rely on\nmyself that I typed those in right.\n\n187\n00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:22.210\nSo you could isolate like one column and\n\n188\n00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:24.840\nthen do your spell check,\nwhich I haven't done it on this one.\n\n189\n00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.860\nI usually wait to the very end,\nbecause I make spell check.\n\n190\n00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:30.670\nI do this like incrementalling and\nI will always make more mistakes.\n\n191\n00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:33.020\nSo just make that,\njust want to let you know.\n\n192\n00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:36.840\nYou can select before you do\na spell check, and that is good.\n\n193\n00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:41.290\nFew more things with proofing,\nthe thesaurus.\n\n194\n00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:45.090\nI always have to slow down when I\nsay that because it's the [SOUND].\n\n195\n00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:48.745\n[LAUGH] See, I'm already trying\nto mispronounce it, Justin.\n\n196\n00:10:48.745 --> 00:10:50.928\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's the saurus.\n\n197\n00:10:50.928 --> 00:10:51.696\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n198\n00:10:51.696 --> 00:10:52.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it.\n\n199\n00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:53.680\nThe thesaurus.\n\n200\n00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.705\nIt is kind of hard because\nthere's two the the in there.\n\n201\n00:10:55.705 --> 00:10:57.010\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n202\n00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:59.250\nAnd as for a book of synonyms.\n\n203\n00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:05.630\nWait, I'm getting into something else\nin the English language aren't I.\n\n204\n00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:08.390\n&gt;&gt; I think that's homophones and homonyms.\n\n205\n00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:15.210\nYeah synonyms are words that mean close\nto the same thing, have the same meaning.\n\n206\n00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:18.800\nAnd sometimes the source\nthe sore I the sources.\n\n207\n00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.530\nI don't know.\n\n208\n00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:24.690\nI also have antonyms which would give\nyou hey I know I don't want awesome.\n\n209\n00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:26.100\nWhat's the opposite of awesome?\n\n210\n00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:29.440\nWell I don't know because\nit's the thesaurus.\n\n211\n00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:29.940\nMan.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n212\n00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:30.760\n&gt;&gt; We're going to have to\n\n213\n00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.320\nget off of this topic.\nBecause it's about to get crazy.\n\n214\n00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.195\nBut that's not all of the sources.\n\n215\n00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:38.210\n[LAUGH] Having antonyms.\n\n216\n00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:41.180\nMost of the time it's for synonyms.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I know we're\n\n217\n00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.960\ngoing to have to try and\ncall it something else.\n\n218\n00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.390\nThe words that mean the same.\n\n219\n00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:50.470\nSo yes that thing that we want to do for\nsay the word smart.\n\n220\n00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:51.818\nOkay what's another word for smart?\n\n221\n00:11:51.818 --> 00:11:55.900\nIntelligent, witty, others.\n\n222\n00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:56.790\nSure, a bunch more.\n\n223\n00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:58.090\nBut how am I gonna get to.\n\n224\n00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:00.290\nI'm gonna go to the Review tab.\n\n225\n00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:04.060\nNow that is where you could go ahead and\ndo your spell check right at the top.\n\n226\n00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:08.470\nIt's also where you can find that\nbook of [INAUDIBLE] the same thing.\n\n227\n00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:11.060\nYou could also right-click on this.\n\n228\n00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.160\nAnd then you can go to that right here.\n\n229\n00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.052\nI'm gonna even.\nI'm not even gonna try and say it anymore.\n\n230\n00:12:15.052 --> 00:12:17.480\n[LAUGH] Because I know I'm\ngonna trip over it really bad.\n\n231\n00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.740\nSo I'm going to click on it.\n\n232\n00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:23.150\nAnd it brings up over here this task pane,\nover here on the right.\n\n233\n00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:25.180\nThe thing about this little guy.\n\n234\n00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:30.629\nIt can be a little [SOUND] weird, okay?\n\n235\n00:12:30.629 --> 00:12:32.300\nLet me show you actually\na little bit behind my head.\n\n236\n00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:37.170\nNotice that it has all these\ndifferent ones, fashionable.\n\n237\n00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:39.420\nLike, it's a smart dresser.\n\n238\n00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.630\nSo I could see where\nthey're going with that.\n\n239\n00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:43.890\nGlitzy, ritzy swanky.\n\n240\n00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:45.230\nAnd this starts to get into,\n\n241\n00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:50.013\nnotice that there's a lot of different\noptions that they have here.\n\n242\n00:12:50.013 --> 00:12:54.615\nAnd they do have something we\ntalked about antonyms right?\n\n243\n00:12:54.615 --> 00:13:00.098\nThat they have shabby, they start\nto get a little obstruction, right.\n\n244\n00:13:00.098 --> 00:13:05.980\nThe other thing about this is say, hey,\nI would really like to have clever.\n\n245\n00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:08.570\nThat's sounds like another word\nthat I would like to use smart.\n\n246\n00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:11.920\nSo you would double click on it, thinking\nlike to me, you double click on it.\n\n247\n00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.630\nAnd makes it go that doesn't happen.\n\n248\n00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:17.740\nWhat it does is it throws clever into\nthe word that it is searching for for\n\n249\n00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:18.740\nsynonyms.\n\n250\n00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.420\nAnd then it goes ahead and\ngives you those.\n\n251\n00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:25.200\nAnd that's goodness,\nthat starts to get a little weird.\n\n252\n00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.270\nIf I really wanted to put in\nlet's say crafty is now the word.\n\n253\n00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:35.290\nYou have to right-click on this and then\nyou have to insert that particular word.\n\n254\n00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:40.370\nAnd that's how you can actually change\nout the words from one to another.\n\n255\n00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:42.350\nWhich is to me a little weird.\n\n256\n00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:45.690\nI want to double click\nit doesn't it just goes.\n\n257\n00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:49.810\nAnd you can just get in this infinite\nloop within this book of synonyms and\n\n258\n00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:51.390\nyou'll never get out of it.\n\n259\n00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:54.480\nSo just be careful about that,\nright click on it and bring that up.\n\n260\n00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:59.720\nThe other thing that's kin of fun is that\nyou have something on a smart lookup.\n\n261\n00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:05.550\nSmartLookup is part of the intelligent\nservices that Office is trying to get to.\n\n262\n00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:09.440\nYou do need to have connection to\nthe internet to be able to use this but\n\n263\n00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.110\nit's just gonna look something up.\n\n264\n00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:15.730\nIt's kinda like, hey,\nI wanna know the statistics for\n\n265\n00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.850\nthe population of Gainesville.\n\n266\n00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:18.350\nWhere do we go?\n\n267\n00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:21.450\nWe pull out our phones, we start\ntyping it in the search engine and\n\n268\n00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:22.930\nit brings it back.\n\n269\n00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:24.320\nThat's what it's doing here.\n\n270\n00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.470\nDo you know the search\nengine from Microsoft,\n\n271\n00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:28.710\nJustin?\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n272\n00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:30.510\nIt's called Bing.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.\n\n273\n00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:31.360\n&gt;&gt; Because, bing,\n\n274\n00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.360\nbing, bing, I don't know,\nBing Crosby, who knows?\n\n275\n00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:38.640\nBut, it is called Bing.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, well maybe it's like ping, but\n\n276\n00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.800\nBing.\n\n277\n00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.100\nWe are totally making all this up,\nwe have no idea.\n\n278\n00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.930\nBut anyways,\nthat is what it is going to pull from.\n\n279\n00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:49.070\nSo I am going to right click on this and\ngo to the smart lookup.\n\n280\n00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:52.360\nSo when I go to smart lookup,\nit's bringing up this,\n\n281\n00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.100\nand look at these cute little kitties.\n\n282\n00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:59.390\nOkay, so notice it has a web search,\nit's got some other things down here.\n\n283\n00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:03.870\nAnd actually behind my head you can\nsee that it is powered by Bing.\n\n284\n00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:09.270\nOne other thing that I wanted to just show\nyou guys is that the very first time.\n\n285\n00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:12.050\nLet me just minimize these so\nwe can see my desktop.\n\n286\n00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:16.340\nI wanted to show you that the very first\ntime you do this, it will show you that,\n\n287\n00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:18.410\nhey, guess what.\n\n288\n00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:20.220\nWe're gonna send it to Bing.\n\n289\n00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:24.600\nSo I'm just letting you know\nthat that's what we're doing.\n\n290\n00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:28.990\nRight, so first time, you will see that,\nyou could read the privacy statement.\n\n291\n00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:32.730\nAnd I mean,\nI trust Microsoft with my life.\n\n292\n00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:36.910\nSo we're going to just trust that\nthey won't do anything bad with it.\n\n293\n00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:39.783\nCool, okay, so at least it lets\nyou know that you're doing that.\n\n294\n00:15:39.783 --> 00:15:43.380\nAnd I can to Web Search is and\ndo some different things.\n\n295\n00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:46.680\nFor example,\nif I come over here and go to.\n\n296\n00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:49.870\nAnd do a smart lookup,\nthen it's gonna bring up Fuego.\n\n297\n00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:52.300\nAnd there's some pictures of fire and\nthings like that.\n\n298\n00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:54.786\nThis does go to the internet.\n\n299\n00:15:54.786 --> 00:15:58.720\nSo just be aware of what it's\ngoing to be pulling back for you.\n\n300\n00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.440\nAll right, but it is Microsoft so\nhopefully they filled.\n\n301\n00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:05.090\nFiltered out some of the maybe not so\ngood stuff.\n\n302\n00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:06.414\nYou'd like to hope.\n&gt;&gt; One would hope,\n\n303\n00:16:06.414 --> 00:16:08.520\nbut sometimes you still get weird results.\n\n304\n00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:12.910\nLike you just looked up cat, and\nyou got caterpillar equipment.\n\n305\n00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:16.100\nLike industrial equipment\nbecause that's their short name.\n\n306\n00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:20.345\nSo be aware, you may go well that's not\ndoing right, well, sometimes it's very\n\n307\n00:16:20.345 --> 00:16:22.791\nspecific to the industry.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, very good.\n\n308\n00:16:22.791 --> 00:16:23.917\nI didn't even notice.\n\n309\n00:16:23.917 --> 00:16:27.173\nI was just looking at all the cute\nlittle cats pictures up there, so.\n\n310\n00:16:27.173 --> 00:16:31.969\nAll right, so that's what we do when\nwe're getting ready to have our document\n\n311\n00:16:31.969 --> 00:16:35.324\nprepared for, whether it's screen or\nfor printing.\n\n312\n00:16:35.324 --> 00:16:43.920\nNow let's move on to the big topic\nof print preview and page layouts.\n\n313\n00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:48.970\nJust going to go ahead and let you\nknow that in the Mac world, you're not\n\n314\n00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:55.910\nnearly as extensive in your print\npreview as you are in Windows.\n\n315\n00:16:55.910 --> 00:17:00.390\nI do like the print preview in Windows\nversions of your office products.\n\n316\n00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:02.100\nGives you a lot of things.\n\n317\n00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.720\nIt's a little lacking in the mackerel.\n\n318\n00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:10.270\nYou can still do it, just not in\nthis nice kind of pretty package.\n\n319\n00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:12.120\nYou have to go all over the place.\n\n320\n00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:17.250\nI'm just going to warn you right here,\nthat we are going to be like dipping and\n\n321\n00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:21.620\ndiving and weaving, and going to all these\ndifferent places, because there's so\n\n322\n00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:26.700\nmany different places and\ndifferent ways that you can do\n\n323\n00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:32.360\npage setup and print preview in\na sense and really, cuz page preview.\n\n324\n00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:37.940\nPage layout, print preview, printing\nalways for the same reason of I'm setting\n\n325\n00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:43.820\nup my data in some kind of way\nthat I need to display it.\n\n326\n00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:47.220\nAnd so just keep that in mind and\nstay with me and\n\n327\n00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:53.380\nhopefully as I kind of bottom weave,\nyou'll find the way you like to do it.\n\n328\n00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:56.115\nI don't hit every single way.\n\n329\n00:17:56.115 --> 00:18:00.001\nNo, there's only so much time [LAUGH]\nthat we have to talk about this thing.\n\n330\n00:18:00.001 --> 00:18:02.740\nOtherwise you don't want me to be\ntalking about this for days on end.\n\n331\n00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:06.305\nI could but [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Just the fact that you're like,\n\n332\n00:18:06.305 --> 00:18:08.267\nI'm gonna tell you a bunch of ways.\n\n333\n00:18:08.267 --> 00:18:11.790\nMaybe that's why I break out into cold\nsweats when I'm like I need to do this.\n\n334\n00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:13.213\nI'm scared though.\n\n335\n00:18:13.213 --> 00:18:16.501\nBut maybe you'll show me something that\njust makes my life easier one that I\n\n336\n00:18:16.501 --> 00:18:18.010\ndidn't know about.\n\n337\n00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:20.682\nAnd so I'm kind of interested\nto see how this plays out.\n\n338\n00:18:20.682 --> 00:18:22.802\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a couple of gotchas in\n\n339\n00:18:22.802 --> 00:18:24.790\nthere that have just like, even for\n\n340\n00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:27.856\nme I'm where I'm like that's\nwhat it's been doing?\n\n341\n00:18:27.856 --> 00:18:31.700\nI'm thinking, it's a glitch within\nthe program, it's just a bug.\n\n342\n00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:32.930\nWell, it's kind of a bug but\n\n343\n00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:35.800\nthem I'm like,\nthat's how I can turn it turn it back.\n\n344\n00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:36.820\nOkay, fine.\n\n345\n00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:38.970\nThat's the way you\nare going to make me do it.\n\n346\n00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:40.000\nI will.\n\n347\n00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.110\nLet's get started.\n\n348\n00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:45.540\nSo, we will start here on this particular\nwork sheet that we are going with.\n\n349\n00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:47.700\nI would like,\nI would like to print this out.\n\n350\n00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:51.250\nOkay, so let's go to File &gt; Print Preview.\n\n351\n00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:52.800\nWell, sorry, I forgot.\n\n352\n00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:57.295\nThere is no print preview as\nin there is a menu command,\n\n353\n00:18:57.295 --> 00:19:00.343\nit is just print and dot, dot, dot.\n\n354\n00:19:00.343 --> 00:19:06.114\nMeaning it will take you too\nthe print preview dialogue box.\n\n355\n00:19:06.114 --> 00:19:08.076\nNow when you fo the print\npreview dialogue box,\n\n356\n00:19:08.076 --> 00:19:10.148\njust in case it doesn't\nlook like mine right now.\n\n357\n00:19:10.148 --> 00:19:12.621\nThere is a button down at the bottom.\n\n358\n00:19:12.621 --> 00:19:15.811\nIt says right now the high details,\nso if it look like this and\n\n359\n00:19:15.811 --> 00:19:18.449\nyou just don't have your detail showing,\nokay?\n\n360\n00:19:18.449 --> 00:19:22.980\nSo when you click the Show Details, it's\ngonna give you a couple other options.\n\n361\n00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:25.812\nAnd notice like what printer\nyou want to print to this.\n\n362\n00:19:25.812 --> 00:19:29.220\nThat's a whole lot of ball game\nof connecting your printers.\n\n363\n00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:33.228\nUsually not so pretty good about doing it.\n\n364\n00:19:33.228 --> 00:19:34.910\nFind a device, connect it.\n\n365\n00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:38.060\nJustin's over here going.\n&gt;&gt; That is,\n\n366\n00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.620\nwe are fairly technical people.\n\n367\n00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:43.230\nAnd there are so many times that I'm\njust like, why are you not printing?\n\n368\n00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:47.179\nSo that is an entirely\ndifferent right there.\n\n369\n00:19:47.179 --> 00:19:51.890\nSo if you have a printer, close your\nfingers and just hope that it works.\n\n370\n00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:55.850\nBut if it does work, you still have a lot\nof other details to make a selection for\n\n371\n00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:58.830\nwhen the print actually does occur,\nor when you set up your printer and\n\n372\n00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:59.670\nit does occur.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n373\n00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:03.509\nWe have an office full of\nridiculously smart technical people,\n\n374\n00:20:03.509 --> 00:20:07.001\nDon is probably one of most of\nthe technical people I know.\n\n375\n00:20:07.001 --> 00:20:10.770\nAnd [LAUGH] he lot of times throw\nout printer out the window.\n\n376\n00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:13.250\nSo, it happened to us, you are not alone.\n\n377\n00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:19.195\nOkay, but now this is like how many\ncopies, all of these different page sizes.\n\n378\n00:20:19.195 --> 00:20:21.970\nWe'll talk lot about this in other places.\n\n379\n00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:24.331\nI know this is really small.\n\n380\n00:20:24.331 --> 00:20:28.020\nBut you could see right now that it\nis breaking us up into two pages and\n\n381\n00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:30.570\nthen if I click this\nlittle button right here.\n\n382\n00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:33.510\nOkay, so that just has that\none extra column, hanging out.\n\n383\n00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:37.321\nIf you're talking about, you have to\ncut it up and make a collage out of it.\n\n384\n00:20:37.321 --> 00:20:42.297\nOkay, this is just one page,\none worksheet, and I'm already,\n\n385\n00:20:42.297 --> 00:20:44.340\nhow do I fix this?\n\n386\n00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:46.782\nThere's a whole bunch of different ways.\n\n387\n00:20:46.782 --> 00:20:50.000\nAnd so this is where we're\ngonna start bobbing and\n\n388\n00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.630\nweaving through our print preview,\npage set up whole lesson and everything.\n\n389\n00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:59.350\nSomething else to notice that once you\nchoose print preview on this particular\n\n390\n00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:03.360\nworksheet, do you see it, it's kinda hard,\nbut do you see that line right there,\n\n391\n00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:07.350\nJustin, those like dotted lines?\n&gt;&gt; I do and the reason I see it so\n\n392\n00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:11.530\nwell is pretty sure older versions of\nExcel didn't have that initially and\n\n393\n00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:15.040\nthen your just like, well,\nthat printed out 15 sheets.\n\n394\n00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:19.230\nMaybe I'm wrong, maybe it was there the\nwhole time, but it is fairly prominent now\n\n395\n00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:21.560\nand it's a cue to us, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n396\n00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.280\nit is letting us know that this\nis where the pages are breaking.\n\n397\n00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:28.810\nI don't remember,\nhonestly of when this started or\n\n398\n00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:30.560\nif it's always been there and\nI didn't notice.\n\n399\n00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:33.920\nI've been teaching this,\nI taught Excel 2002 [LAUGH] and\n\n400\n00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:37.170\nI don't remember now if it's\nalways been there or not.\n\n401\n00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:40.290\nYes, it only happens, though,\nafter you hit Print Preview.\n\n402\n00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:43.505\nTake also notice, take also notice?\n\n403\n00:21:43.505 --> 00:21:48.040\n[LAUGH] Take notice here that if I go\nto the addresses, there's no dotted\n\n404\n00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:52.670\nlines here Because I didn't print\npreview this particular worksheet.\n\n405\n00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:56.020\nI did for this one, and so what, and it's\njust gonna stay there from now on, okay?\n\n406\n00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:57.560\nThat throws people, why do I have this?\n\n407\n00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:01.140\nIt's just because you previewed,\nit's just what's it's doing, okay?\n\n408\n00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:05.960\nSo it's okay and can be helpful for\nyou to let you know where you're going.\n\n409\n00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:12.550\nBut how I can start kind of changing\nthe page set up, the page layout?\n\n410\n00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:16.300\nIn here, you can do this in\na couple different places.\n\n411\n00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.600\nGonna go over where we can bob and\nweave right now.\n\n412\n00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.610\nYou have a Page Layout tab on the ribbon.\n\n413\n00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:27.320\nSo things like Margins, Orientations,\nBreaks, Print Titles, Page Setup.\n\n414\n00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:28.300\nAll of this stuff.\n\n415\n00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:29.240\nThe scaling.\n\n416\n00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.770\nPrinting the grid lines and headings.\n\n417\n00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:32.605\nWe talked about this in\na couple of other episodes.\n\n418\n00:22:32.605 --> 00:22:34.240\nIt's all right here.\n\n419\n00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.500\nTotally fine to go that way.\n\n420\n00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.120\nPage Setup button is right here.\n\n421\n00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.630\nIt's also in your File menu.\n\n422\n00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:43.780\nWhen you go to File &gt; Page Setup,\nwe're gonna go through each one of these.\n\n423\n00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:47.660\nLike Pages, Margins, Headers,\nFooters, and the Sheet.\n\n424\n00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:50.440\nThese are kinda the things that\nare sometimes like hiding in\n\n425\n00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:51.800\nthe background that people are like.\n\n426\n00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:52.480\nI'm like, no, no.\n\n427\n00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.720\nGo to the Sheets tab and\nchoose Print Gridlines.\n\n428\n00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.210\nThat's what it does.\n\n429\n00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:59.700\nWhy does it go down than over?\n\n430\n00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:04.470\nIf I am making my collage, I want to go\nover than down, then you can go here.\n\n431\n00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:10.917\nYou can totally do all this stuff from\nthis particular page set up dialog box.\n\n432\n00:23:10.917 --> 00:23:11.852\nLike I said,\n\n433\n00:23:11.852 --> 00:23:17.292\nthe ribbon here is also another thing that\nyou can do that I will go back out and\n\n434\n00:23:17.292 --> 00:23:22.392\nforth from this is remember that page\nlayout view that we did, Justin,\n\n435\n00:23:22.392 --> 00:23:28.091\nwhere you're like I just wouldn't work\nin Excel this way and I agreed with you.\n\n436\n00:23:28.091 --> 00:23:32.725\nBut when I'm doing page setup,\nit's actually really,\n\n437\n00:23:32.725 --> 00:23:36.680\nreally handy,\ncuz I can come into page layout and\n\n438\n00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:42.974\nactually see what I'm doing in the page\nlayout that I could not see in normal.\n\n439\n00:23:42.974 --> 00:23:48.024\nLike I could go into here and add and\nchange the margins the orientation and\n\n440\n00:23:48.024 --> 00:23:51.623\nI would never visually see it,\nhere in normal mode.\n\n441\n00:23:51.623 --> 00:23:54.404\nBut I would have to then go\nto File &gt; Print Preview and\n\n442\n00:23:54.404 --> 00:23:56.500\nI've been doing it that way for years.\n\n443\n00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:01.370\nAnd that's was like I've just read,\nI'll be completely house with you.\n\n444\n00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:06.940\nI've just recently came to\nappreciate why this view is good,\n\n445\n00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:11.160\ncuz it's a lot easier to see\nhow it's gonna turn out.\n\n446\n00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.410\nSo that's a pretty cool thing to do and\n\n447\n00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:18.530\nnotice that when I'm down in here what\nI can see and all that kind of stuff.\n\n448\n00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:23.740\nSo we'll be going through these different\npieces kind of showing you all back and\n\n449\n00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:28.960\nforth, because, yeah, to get this all on a\npage instead of printing it out this way.\n\n450\n00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.910\nI'd print it in landscape.\n\n451\n00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:31.910\nI'd change the margins.\n\n452\n00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:33.350\nI'd put headers and footers in it.\n\n453\n00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:35.190\nI would do all this kind of stuff and\n\n454\n00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:38.020\nmake my life a little easier.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Vonne, I'm definitely talking mad\n\n455\n00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:42.020\nsmack about that page layout view, but I'm\ngonna go ahead and write that down on my\n\n456\n00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:47.350\nhand here, because I could see where this,\nI'm not saying I have, but, yes, I have.\n\n457\n00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:50.210\nI still do and have done recently.\n\n458\n00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:54.490\nLet me rewind it, change the margins and\nprint preview [LAUGH] and\n\n459\n00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:56.030\nthen just see what happens.\n\n460\n00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:57.110\nBut if I have a lot.\nI like that and\n\n461\n00:24:57.110 --> 00:25:00.548\nthen it just kind of, there we go.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm right there with you.\n\n462\n00:25:00.548 --> 00:25:06.010\nI'm almost embarrassed to say\nthat [LAUGH], but anyways,\n\n463\n00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:09.010\nI do have a lot to talk\nabout in that sense.\n\n464\n00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:12.270\nAnd I kind of struggled, I always\nstruggle with this particular episode,\n\n465\n00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:14.980\nbecause do I break it up in all of the\npieces, like let me show you the margins.\n\n466\n00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:19.938\nThat would take you like five minutes,\nbut how it kind of all ties together,\n\n467\n00:25:19.938 --> 00:25:23.346\nthat's why I think we're\ngonna have to come back and\n\n468\n00:25:23.346 --> 00:25:26.073\ndo a part two on this particular episode.\n\n469\n00:25:26.073 --> 00:25:30.522\nSo we can just jump right in,\nyou know where to find it in the menu and\n\n470\n00:25:30.522 --> 00:25:34.820\nthe ribbon and we know about\nthe new appreciation for our views.\n\n471\n00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:38.590\nSo we'll pick up back on\nthat in just a little bit.\n\n472\n00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:39.430\n&gt;&gt; Well, you heard it,\n\n473\n00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:40.600\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n474\n00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:44.300\nSame OfficePro time,\nsame OfficePro channel.\n\n475\n00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:48.460\nDefinitely join us on back for a part\ntwo in print and proof and page layout.\n\n476\n00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:49.961\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n477\n00:25:49.961 --> 00:25:53.190\nSo signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n478\n00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:54.060\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n479\n00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:55.185\n&gt;&gt;

OfficePro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:20.867\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and we're\ncontinuing on with a part two in our print\n\n4\n00:00:20.867 --> 00:00:26.670\npage layout and proof episode of our\nExcel 2016 essentials for Macs series.\n\n5\n00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.170\nWhew, I should have taken a deeper\nbreath before I said all that.\n\n6\n00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.050\nBut in our first episode, if you haven't\nseen part one, definitely go check\n\n7\n00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.860\nthat out, it kinda sets the scenes,\nsets everything up for us.\n\n8\n00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.463\nWell, we talked about a thesaurus,\nand spell checking.\n\n9\n00:00:38.463 --> 00:00:42.912\nAnd then we start get into some more tools\nthat will alleviate some of the heartache\n\n10\n00:00:42.912 --> 00:00:45.210\nwhen you go to print Excel worksheets.\n\n11\n00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.920\nAnd well, I didn't know any of them,\nbut we luckily have someone who did and\n\n12\n00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:49.846\nshe's back today.\n\n13\n00:00:49.846 --> 00:00:50.383\nMs. Vonne Smith,\n\n14\n00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:52.890\nhow are you doing today Vonne?\n&gt;&gt; I thought you did an amazing job on\n\n15\n00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.950\nintro cuz I'm throwing you for a loop\nwith that iteration and the triples and\n\n16\n00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.285\nthis whole thing so good job.\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm about to go take a nap now\n\n17\n00:01:02.285 --> 00:01:07.270\ncuz I'm wore out, but\nluckily we have you here to help us.\n\n18\n00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.140\nI know you love page layout and\nproofing and\n\n19\n00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.850\nit's kind of a love hate relationship,\nbut where did we leave off and\n\n20\n00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.830\nwhere are we going.\n&gt;&gt; Yes great idea,\n\n21\n00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.630\nyes let's do a quick recap.\n\n22\n00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.800\nWe talked about all the different ways\nthat we can do page setup basically, okay?\n\n23\n00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.030\nOur margins, our orientation,\nthe sheet, the headers and footers,\n\n24\n00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.500\nokay, all these things that are in\nany Office product for the most part.\n\n25\n00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.400\nWord, PowerPoint, even Access Reports.\n\n26\n00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.420\nSo these are very common things that\nwe are going to do when we're ready to,\n\n27\n00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.010\nin a sense, print out our pages.\n\n28\n00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.020\nNow you could also print it to a PDF.\n\n29\n00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.600\nWe could be printing this out to a digital\ncopy, it doesn't have to be a hard copy.\n\n30\n00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.440\nBut that's still in a sense like\nhow I wanna lay out my page.\n\n31\n00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.550\nSo we're gonna be going through all\nthe different ways and we left off,\n\n32\n00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.050\nactually, why don't we just go ahead and\njump down in here.\n\n33\n00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.980\nWe left off right here on\nthe Print Layout View that you and\n\n34\n00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.760\nI have both said we were\nkinda dissing on it.\n\n35\n00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.787\nBut it's really great,\nbe honest, we talked off camera,\n\n36\n00:02:15.787 --> 00:02:18.440\n[LAUGH] there are some\ntimes where I'm like.\n\n37\n00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.760\nWhy didn't I show them this when I was\nteaching page layout like a couple\n\n38\n00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.486\nyears ago?\n\n39\n00:02:23.486 --> 00:02:24.990\nWould've been way better.\n\n40\n00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.805\nBut I also taught primarily on Windows and\nwith a print preview,\n\n41\n00:02:30.805 --> 00:02:36.340\ndialog box you gonna say now,\nit actually shows you a lot better.\n\n42\n00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.940\nSo that's another reason why I\nhad to crack myself I was like,\n\n43\n00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.620\nit's okay Vonne,\nyou are doing what you needed to do.\n\n44\n00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.304\n[LAUGH] Now that you are back in Mac\nworld for a lot of times this is gonna\n\n45\n00:02:45.304 --> 00:02:49.700\na really great way to visualize what\nwe gonna change about our page setup.\n\n46\n00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.930\nSo, we're gonna stick in here for\na little bit.\n\n47\n00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.796\nLet's start off with hey,\non this particular worksheet,\n\n48\n00:02:56.796 --> 00:03:00.895\nhow can I get this to kinda\njust fit all on one page?\n\n49\n00:03:00.895 --> 00:03:02.535\nThere're so many ways, okay?\n\n50\n00:03:02.535 --> 00:03:06.470\n[LAUGH] Lots of ways, but\nlet's go over to our Page Layout ribbon.\n\n51\n00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.650\nOrientation, left off from that too,\nPortrait, let me get a piece of paper.\n\n52\n00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.530\nPortrait versus landscape, okay?\n\n53\n00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.850\nThis is wider,so I don't want to also,\nsorry.\n\n54\n00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:24.278\nI just realized probably put your paper\ndown, you're covering your microphone.\n\n55\n00:03:24.278 --> 00:03:28.250\nSo, [LAUGH] this and this, okay?\n\n56\n00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.920\nSo you get wider here than this,\nokay, just put it down Vonne.\n\n57\n00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.310\nAll right, we are gonna go ahead and\nchange it.\n\n58\n00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.380\nLet's go with landscape, almost,\n\n59\n00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.250\nsee I almost got all of that on there so\nwe're getting close.\n\n60\n00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.000\nSo that's my first go to\nchange it to landscape.\n\n61\n00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.740\n&gt;&gt; This is typically what happens to me.\n\n62\n00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.680\nWell, I only have this much\nlandscape should be fine and\n\n63\n00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.160\nmaybe I over commit instead\nof double checking.\n\n64\n00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.730\nAnd then I always get that one little,\n\n65\n00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.205\nlike the last three letters of a word\nfrom the one place on the next sheet.\n\n66\n00:04:00.205 --> 00:04:03.320\nAnd you did bring up something\nthat I forget about.\n\n67\n00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.490\nIn the Mac world, if you're gonna print\nthe PDF, which is like save to PDF,\n\n68\n00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.120\nthis is the same layout that\nyou're gonna get in a PDF.\n\n69\n00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.110\nSo if you need to distribute this as some\nkind of document that is not editable,\n\n70\n00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.240\nthis is also helpful as well, right?\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yep and so\n\n71\n00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.990\nwhether you're a hard copier or\na digital copy, it's still the same thing.\n\n72\n00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:25.100\nSo the orientation is one place\nthat I try to start, okay?\n\n73\n00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.550\nI just let you know if I wanted to,\nI could of gone to File and\n\n74\n00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.670\nI could of gone to Page Setup, and\nchanged it right here in the Page, okay?\n\n75\n00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.270\nBut again, we're gonna try and\ngo to different places.\n\n76\n00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.030\nWhile I'm here, this right here,\nthe scaling, yes.\n\n77\n00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.590\nYou can, keep it in mind,\nI will come back to it, okay?\n\n78\n00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.690\nI promise like I said, there's a bunch\nof different ways that I could just\n\n79\n00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.160\nsquash all this onto\na single piece of paper.\n\n80\n00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.940\nLet's keep going cuz some other things\nthat I can do in Page Layout would be\n\n81\n00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.350\nchanging the margins.\n\n82\n00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.860\nNow, what's a margin?\n\n83\n00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.140\nA margin is the white space around\nyour page, all of this white space.\n\n84\n00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:11.770\nThe other thing that the margins do,\nit's where Headers and Footers leave.\n\n85\n00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.900\nHeaders is something that repeats\non the top of every printed page,\n\n86\n00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.340\nthe Footer is what's printed on\nthe bottom of every printed page.\n\n87\n00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.440\nRented digital or hard copy.\n\n88\n00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.120\nSo that's something you could do,\nwhat if I change the size of the margins?\n\n89\n00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.850\nMade them a little smaller\non maybe the left and\n\n90\n00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.440\nright sides,\nthat's one way I could do this.\n\n91\n00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.240\nIn the Page Layout tab on the ribbon\nyou have some presets too.\n\n92\n00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.690\nWe have Normal, Wide, Narrow.\n\n93\n00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.670\nNow, I don't wanna go wide because\nthat's gonna make more white space.\n\n94\n00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:48.640\nSo, it's gonna have less room\nin the printing area for me.\n\n95\n00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.310\nBut let's just show you, see.\n\n96\n00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.077\nWell, that didn't really do anything,\neither, but, [LAUGH] in the sense that,\n\n97\n00:05:54.077 --> 00:05:55.400\nit didn't make the spaces.\n\n98\n00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.240\nBut notice if I go to narrow,\nwell look at that!\n\n99\n00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.118\nNarrow actually just fit everything\nonto this one piece of paper,\n\n100\n00:06:03.118 --> 00:06:05.391\nand I'm looking pretty good.\n\n101\n00:06:05.391 --> 00:06:08.072\nI like that, and for\nthis particular example,\n\n102\n00:06:08.072 --> 00:06:11.900\nthat was one way that we could\ngo ahead and make this happen.\n\n103\n00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.640\nChange the orientation,\nchange the margins.\n\n104\n00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.730\nCool, so that's one way to start.\n\n105\n00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.570\nThe other thing with the margins is\nnotice that we have these presets, but\n\n106\n00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.090\nif you click on Custom Margins,\nyep, you know it.\n\n107\n00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.040\nYou're gonna go into the page layout\ndialog box and then you can change tha.\n\n108\n00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.010\nAnd just to prove another point,\n\n109\n00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:32.190\nI'm gonna switch back over\ninto the normal view, normal.\n\n110\n00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.710\nAnd if I go back over here to\nPage Lsyout change this back to Wide and\n\n111\n00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:36.800\nchange the orientation.\n\n112\n00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.160\nDid I do any single change\non this view right here?\n\n113\n00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.702\nNope, so that's why going back to\nthat other view is really nice.\n\n114\n00:06:45.702 --> 00:06:50.450\nI'm gonna switch back, Margins, Narrow,\ngo to View, clicking really fast,\n\n115\n00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.760\nso great way.\n\n116\n00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:59.695\nSo this next thing that I'm gonna show you\nthat is another one of my little things.\n\n117\n00:06:59.695 --> 00:07:02.000\nVertical justification,\nI've said that a couple times.\n\n118\n00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.500\nI'm kind of obsessed with it, yeah.\n\n119\n00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:10.120\nBack on that Page Layout,\nnow I can't do this here.\n\n120\n00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:14.220\nI can't do what I wanna show you on\nthe buttons, but it's in the Page Setup.\n\n121\n00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.570\nIt's these guys right here, I love these.\n\n122\n00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:21.380\nCenter on the page Vertically and\nHorizontally,\n\n123\n00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:27.197\nyes put it right there in the middle and\nthen you're so excited you click OK.\n\n124\n00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:30.670\nIt doesn't matter whether if\nyou're in page layout view or not.\n\n125\n00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.310\nThe only place that you're\ngonna really see this,\n\n126\n00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:37.990\nI'm doing a Cmd+P right now for Print.\n\n127\n00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.550\nThere you go.\n\n128\n00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.490\nSee I can see it vertically centered and\n\n129\n00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.840\nyou're ,that's not completely\nvertically centered.\n\n130\n00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:49.480\nIt's a little misleading because there's\nsome information down here at the bottom,\n\n131\n00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.480\nbut it is more vertically\ncentered than it was before.\n\n132\n00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.778\nSo that makes me happy and\nthat's something that I like to do.\n\n133\n00:07:56.778 --> 00:08:00.743\nAnd again, notice you couldn't really\nget to that any other way to see it\n\n134\n00:08:00.743 --> 00:08:04.773\nwas to print preview it And the other\nthing was to go to the Page Setup dialog\n\n135\n00:08:04.773 --> 00:08:08.490\nbox to be able to check those boxes off.\n&gt;&gt; That's kinda odd that the page lay out\n\n136\n00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:09.860\nshows us everything except that.\n\n137\n00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:16.835\nSo we always have to go to the Print Page\nin Mac, so this is in Mac,\n\n138\n00:08:16.835 --> 00:08:22.584\nin order to see that vertical and\nhorizontally centered arrangement,\n\n139\n00:08:22.584 --> 00:08:26.607\nbecause otherwise it just\nkinda fills the page and\n\n140\n00:08:26.607 --> 00:08:28.562\nputs it to the top left?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n141\n00:08:28.562 --> 00:08:31.155\n&gt;&gt; I don't now about that, Vonne.\n\n142\n00:08:31.155 --> 00:08:33.280\nThat would definitely trip me up.\n\n143\n00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.117\nSo I'm gonna have to take\na note of that and go, yeah,\n\n144\n00:08:36.117 --> 00:08:37.880\nyou've gotta go look at the Print Preview.\n\n145\n00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.200\nCuz otherwise you don't see it when you\nclick these two checkboxes for centering\n\n146\n00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.597\non the page horizontally and vertically.\n&gt;&gt; Isn't it fun to try to\n\n147\n00:08:44.597 --> 00:08:45.239\nremember all this?\n\n148\n00:08:45.239 --> 00:08:50.116\n[LAUGH] Yeah, that's why you have\nto bob and weave your way through\n\n149\n00:08:50.116 --> 00:08:54.916\nall of these different dialog boxes,\nviews, print previews.\n\n150\n00:08:54.916 --> 00:08:57.316\nIt can get a little crazy.\n\n151\n00:08:57.316 --> 00:09:02.410\nAll right, so we've covered quite a few\nof those different things so far.\n\n152\n00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:06.223\nWhile we're still here let's\ndo headers and footers, okay?\n\n153\n00:09:06.223 --> 00:09:11.105\nI like a good header and footer,\nespecially when you're getting something\n\n154\n00:09:11.105 --> 00:09:14.010\nmaybe as when you get\nsomething faxed to you.\n\n155\n00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:14.976\nYeah, it still exists.\n\n156\n00:09:14.976 --> 00:09:17.717\nAnd it has that on the bottom,\nyou don't know how many pages,\n\n157\n00:09:17.717 --> 00:09:20.619\nespecially if they didn't give\nyou a cover page or your printer,\n\n158\n00:09:20.619 --> 00:09:22.550\na lot of your faxes do this automatically.\n\n159\n00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:25.493\nBut page 1 of 4, and I only got 2.\n\n160\n00:09:25.493 --> 00:09:29.899\nI like to always have page 1 of,\nhowever many,\n\n161\n00:09:29.899 --> 00:09:33.880\ncuz it makes it a good where I'm at, okay?\n\n162\n00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.770\nSo that might be the file names,\ncompany names.\n\n163\n00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:39.420\nThere's whole different reasons of why and\n\n164\n00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.360\nwhat you wanna put in your headers and\nfooters.\n\n165\n00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:45.600\nSome are company policy,\nlike you always have the file tag,\n\n166\n00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.635\nyou always have to have the date\non all of your reports.\n\n167\n00:09:48.635 --> 00:09:51.750\nThere are all kind of guidelines for\ncompanies, and\n\n168\n00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:54.650\nlike you must have this in\nyour headers and footers.\n\n169\n00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.335\nJust like Headers and Footers,\n\n170\n00:09:57.335 --> 00:10:03.150\nin every application in Office\nthere's three sections.\n\n171\n00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:09.385\nSo notice in this view, if I click\nright here where it says Add Header,\n\n172\n00:10:09.385 --> 00:10:15.325\nI get three separate boxes,\nleft, center, right.\n\n173\n00:10:15.325 --> 00:10:19.013\nThe other thing that's gonna happen in\nthis view that we're in is that we get our\n\n174\n00:10:19.013 --> 00:10:20.125\nfirst contextual tab.\n\n175\n00:10:20.125 --> 00:10:22.789\nI think it's our first contextual tab.\n\n176\n00:10:22.789 --> 00:10:27.682\nAnd where we get a whole separate ribbon,\nor tab on a ribbon, that we had before.\n\n177\n00:10:27.682 --> 00:10:30.172\nHow do I get out of the Header and Footer?\n\n178\n00:10:30.172 --> 00:10:31.416\nJust really quickly.\n\n179\n00:10:31.416 --> 00:10:35.228\nIf I click down here, like in the regular\nworksheet, then it goes away, so\n\n180\n00:10:35.228 --> 00:10:37.780\nthat's what the contextual tabs does.\n\n181\n00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:42.330\nSo if I click back in here,\nclick on that ribbon tab, and\n\n182\n00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:43.912\nnow I've got the different places.\n\n183\n00:10:43.912 --> 00:10:47.619\nI'm gonna zoom in, because there is one\nthing that in the Page Layout View you\n\n184\n00:10:47.619 --> 00:10:48.887\ncan't zoom in very well.\n\n185\n00:10:48.887 --> 00:10:50.560\nSo I'm gonna come over here.\n\n186\n00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.180\nIt might be just because I'm\nin the Header and Footer, but\n\n187\n00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:53.430\nI'm pretty sure it's all over.\n\n188\n00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:54.710\nSo we're gonna go with a header.\n\n189\n00:10:54.710 --> 00:11:00.573\nAnd I could physically\ntype in HELLO WORLD.\n\n190\n00:11:00.573 --> 00:11:03.401\n[LAUGH] I'm trying to.\n\n191\n00:11:03.401 --> 00:11:08.100\nType in any type of text that\nI want to go into there.\n\n192\n00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:10.430\nFine.\n\n193\n00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:14.763\nI also have these buttons at\nthe top that will allow me to do\n\n194\n00:11:14.763 --> 00:11:19.548\nsome very commonly used items\nthat go in the header and footer,\n\n195\n00:11:19.548 --> 00:11:23.908\nlike the date, the time,\nthe file path, the file name.\n\n196\n00:11:23.908 --> 00:11:26.760\nAll of that kinda fun\nstuff that goes into here.\n\n197\n00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:31.370\nSo you can physically type your own or\nput in the current date.\n\n198\n00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:33.961\nNow notice that it does this\nlittle kinda code, that &amp;Date.\n\n199\n00:11:33.961 --> 00:11:38.313\nThis has been around for\na long time in Excel.\n\n200\n00:11:38.313 --> 00:11:41.510\nIt's just pulling out\nwhatever the current date is.\n\n201\n00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:47.620\nNow if I space, like type the space bar,\nand then click in Time, that's cool.\n\n202\n00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:52.432\nAnd then I can come over here and I could\nput in number of pages, or a page number.\n\n203\n00:11:52.432 --> 00:11:57.140\nBut that's just gonna do just\nthe number 1, and the 2, and the 3.\n\n204\n00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:02.500\nBut if I then physically type in of and\nthen click Number of Pages,\n\n205\n00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:08.030\nthat will give me page 1 or 6,\n2 of 6, that kind of stuff.\n\n206\n00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:12.440\nSo those are things I can do by\nthese buttons on the ribbon.\n\n207\n00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.529\nYou could have also,\nif I had to take these out.\n\n208\n00:12:14.529 --> 00:12:19.051\nI'm not gonna take them out for right now,\nbut just know that once you're in here.\n\n209\n00:12:19.051 --> 00:12:22.001\nUnless they have other pre-made ones\nin this drop-down for a header.\n\n210\n00:12:22.001 --> 00:12:24.813\nAnd then it shows different\nthings that it will go ahead,\n\n211\n00:12:24.813 --> 00:12:28.638\nthat I was clicking on individually,\nthey've kinda put them all together.\n\n212\n00:12:28.638 --> 00:12:33.745\nAnd I went ahead and did not go with a\nfile path, because look at that file path.\n\n213\n00:12:33.745 --> 00:12:35.292\nI'm not gonna go ahead and do that, so.\n\n214\n00:12:35.292 --> 00:12:38.745\nAnd the same thing with footers,\nnotice it has the same thing.\n\n215\n00:12:38.745 --> 00:12:42.465\nSo I could choose one of these and\njust automatically put that in.\n\n216\n00:12:42.465 --> 00:12:46.550\nBut I usually like to go ahead and\ndo it myself and move on.\n\n217\n00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:48.981\nNotice when I scroll down it\nautomatically took me out of the header?\n\n218\n00:12:48.981 --> 00:12:52.400\nAnd then I can click on Add a Footer and\n\n219\n00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:56.330\ngo on my merry way.\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne, by adding a header does that\n\n220\n00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.414\nmodify the vertical alignment\nthat we saw hidden away?\n\n221\n00:12:59.414 --> 00:13:01.590\nI feel like that's already a gotcha.\n\n222\n00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:02.769\nSo I'm trying to think,\n\n223\n00:13:02.769 --> 00:13:05.810\nis this a gotcha where it's going\nto now push this content down?\n\n224\n00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:08.315\nOr will it adjust,\nbased on having a header and\n\n225\n00:13:08.315 --> 00:13:12.200\na footer?\n&gt;&gt; Well the headers live in the margin, so\n\n226\n00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:17.950\nI'm pretty sure that the centering is\ngonna go within the margins of your page.\n\n227\n00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:22.126\nNow if you have a really long footer or\nheader, it could potentially.\n\n228\n00:13:22.126 --> 00:13:25.156\nAnd honestly,\nany time you do some printing,\n\n229\n00:13:25.156 --> 00:13:27.883\nit's not exact to the edges of the pages.\n\n230\n00:13:27.883 --> 00:13:32.369\nCuz the printer adds certain\namount of like safe space.\n\n231\n00:13:32.369 --> 00:13:34.331\nIt's never gonna be exact, okay?\n\n232\n00:13:34.331 --> 00:13:38.511\nBut it should be closer than\nnot having vertically centered.\n\n233\n00:13:38.511 --> 00:13:41.147\n[LAUGH] Wow that was a profound statement.\n\n234\n00:13:41.147 --> 00:13:44.620\nAnd I keep forgetting when I scroll\nthat I'm getting out of the footer.\n\n235\n00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:48.407\nBut notice, of course you can go ahead and\nadd HI JUSTIN.\n\n236\n00:13:48.407 --> 00:13:51.505\nThere we go, and\nI've put you my footer, great.\n\n237\n00:13:51.505 --> 00:13:53.260\nAnd then you click out of it, and\n\n238\n00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.380\nthen it will go on every\nprinted page that you have.\n\n239\n00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:01.338\nSo headers and footers, again, really a\ngood way of why we wanna use this view to\n\n240\n00:14:01.338 --> 00:14:04.180\nput in that particular information.\n\n241\n00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:06.692\nYou could do it through here, Page Setup.\n\n242\n00:14:06.692 --> 00:14:09.495\nGo in this way, go to Header and Footer.\n\n243\n00:14:09.495 --> 00:14:11.677\nAnd notice that it's\nshowing me some previews.\n\n244\n00:14:11.677 --> 00:14:16.572\nAnd I can click on the Custom, and\nit goes into the left center, right,\n\n245\n00:14:16.572 --> 00:14:17.885\ndoes the buttons.\n\n246\n00:14:17.885 --> 00:14:20.159\nThis is very,\nwhat's that called, old school.\n\n247\n00:14:20.159 --> 00:14:26.400\nI've seen this iteration of this dialogue\nbox for a very long time in Excel.\n\n248\n00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.280\nSo I can do custom footers and\nall that kinda fun stuff.\n\n249\n00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:33.959\nWith headers and footers you can\ndo this different first page and\n\n250\n00:14:33.959 --> 00:14:35.201\ndifferent odds and evens.\n\n251\n00:14:35.201 --> 00:14:37.780\nThat gets a little bit crazy.\n\n252\n00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.700\nNot too crazy, not in this example.\n\n253\n00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:43.010\nI'll come back around to it when\nwe go over to out next sheet.\n\n254\n00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:44.903\nOkay, so we've gotten that.\n\n255\n00:14:44.903 --> 00:14:50.518\nI wanna come back on to some of\nthe things that you can do in the sheet.\n\n256\n00:14:50.518 --> 00:14:55.587\nNotice in the Page Layout there are some\nthings like the Print Titles and\n\n257\n00:14:55.587 --> 00:14:56.780\nthe Print Area.\n\n258\n00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:01.564\nAnd in Page Setup dialog box it's\non that last tab, or button,\n\n259\n00:15:01.564 --> 00:15:04.468\nI'll say, so we'll come back to it.\n\n260\n00:15:04.468 --> 00:15:09.079\nBut just while I'm here, remember\nthe print gridlines or printing a row and\n\n261\n00:15:09.079 --> 00:15:15.030\ncolumn headings, I think I've pointed out\nthis I think at least twice, maybe more.\n\n262\n00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:17.737\nBut we're back here cuz\nwe're in Page Setup anyways.\n\n263\n00:15:17.737 --> 00:15:21.330\nI'm gonna cancel out of that.\n\n264\n00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.490\nLet's move onto the other worksheet.\n\n265\n00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:27.850\nBecause this isn't that much information,\nright, not that bad.\n\n266\n00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:29.500\nWe've fixed it by doing that stuff.\n\n267\n00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:30.790\nAnd remember?\n\n268\n00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:32.906\nScaling [SOUND], that can be fun.\n\n269\n00:15:32.906 --> 00:15:35.445\nLet's switch over to\nthe Addresses worksheet.\n\n270\n00:15:35.445 --> 00:15:40.320\nAnd notice that it is not\nin the Print Layout view.\n\n271\n00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:44.390\nI'm also going to point out something\nhere now, on the Page Layout tab,\n\n272\n00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:46.430\nthat is right over here.\n\n273\n00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:49.100\nDo you see the scale to fit?\n\n274\n00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.410\nAnd right now it is on Automatic and\nAutomatic.\n\n275\n00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.185\nOkay, keep that in mind.\n\n276\n00:15:54.185 --> 00:15:59.525\nAnd if I go to Page Setup right now,\non the page nothing\n\n277\n00:15:59.525 --> 00:16:04.165\nis declared in this\nScaling issue right here.\n\n278\n00:16:04.165 --> 00:16:05.815\nSet me up, okay.\n\n279\n00:16:05.815 --> 00:16:10.540\n[LAUGH] So, if I click cancel,\nif I wanted to just print preview this.\n\n280\n00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:11.970\nLet's do the old way, right?\n\n281\n00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:12.780\nLet's do a Cmd+P.\n\n282\n00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:17.420\nAnd I'm looking at this, and\nI see there's eight pages in here.\n\n283\n00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:18.950\nAnd I can kinda see it here,\n\n284\n00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:22.520\nI'm sure it's really blurry on\nyour screen but I got half of it.\n\n285\n00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:27.340\nOkay there's the, okay something and\nthen, there's the city and the state.\n\n286\n00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:30.810\nAnd then you go down, this is your clause,\n\n287\n00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:34.290\nright?\n&gt;&gt; This is the jigsaw puzzle of all jigsaw\n\n288\n00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:38.060\npuzzles, because it looks like\nit's based on the orientation.\n\n289\n00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:39.790\nBecause I think it's the font\nthat prints down and\n\n290\n00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:42.990\nthen across, that's not how my mind works.\n\n291\n00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:45.530\nSo then I will have to do\nlike this weird reshuffle.\n\n292\n00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:47.760\nAnd your like, what is this again?\n\n293\n00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.024\nWhere do I put these?\n\n294\n00:16:50.024 --> 00:16:53.558\nYou did set us up, I could tell you\nwe're setting us up, but please tell me\n\n295\n00:16:53.558 --> 00:16:56.150\nyou're gonna tell how to fix this.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\n\n296\n00:16:56.150 --> 00:17:00.360\nI'm gonna tell you how it's gonna\ntrip you up too, cuz it does me too.\n\n297\n00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.650\nRight down here, in this Print, here,\nlet me move this over a little bit.\n\n298\n00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:07.190\nSo you see it's got Scale to fit,\n0 pages wide by 0 pages tall.\n\n299\n00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:11.708\nThat's that Automatic that I\nhad pointed out here, okay?\n\n300\n00:17:11.708 --> 00:17:16.990\nCuz the scaling can really throw you off.\n\n301\n00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:19.450\nI'm not saying it's bad,\nit's actually very good.\n\n302\n00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:21.890\nThat can be weird.\n\n303\n00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:26.420\nSo I'm gonna cancel this and I'm also\ngonna go into our page layout view so\n\n304\n00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.040\nI can see everything.\n\n305\n00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:31.460\nFirst of all do you see how on this page\nregardless of what order I'm going on.\n\n306\n00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:32.440\nIs that the first name?\n\n307\n00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.140\nIs that the last name?\n\n308\n00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:37.710\nThis is one of my big things, you've\ngot to throw a print title on there.\n\n309\n00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:39.940\nWe'll come back around to\nthat in just a little bit,\n\n310\n00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:42.660\nlet's just try to get\nit all on a page first.\n\n311\n00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:46.532\nMan, I really wanna\nhave all of my columns,\n\n312\n00:17:46.532 --> 00:17:51.390\nI wanna have first through\nteam color to be there.\n\n313\n00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:55.441\nThat's first of all we know that we\ncan get a little bit more if we change\n\n314\n00:17:55.441 --> 00:17:56.130\nthis to.\n\n315\n00:17:56.130 --> 00:18:01.180\nIt's already in landscape, cuz I did\nthat in the other one, that's why.\n\n316\n00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:05.820\nOkay, so I already did that,\nlet's make it here.\n\n317\n00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:10.790\nOn the Scale to Fit,\nI wanna scale this to 1 page wide.\n\n318\n00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:14.000\nAnd I click on 1 page,\nooh, it did it, yay!\n\n319\n00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.290\nOkay, cool, perfect,\nthat's exactly what I wanted it to do.\n\n320\n00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:22.330\nAnd so, I can see this and\nif I scroll down then here's my next page.\n\n321\n00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:26.340\nOkay so I, hey, at least I got all\nthe columns on here, that's good.\n\n322\n00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:32.140\nNow, if you try to go ahead and\ndo this to one page high, all right.\n\n323\n00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:38.260\nWell, in this view you got it all on\none page, but when you print this out,\n\n324\n00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:43.120\nthat is really, really tiny, isn't it?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm not saying I've done this,\n\n325\n00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.490\nbut I've done this.\n&gt;&gt; I have too.\n\n326\n00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:51.510\nSo, you gotta kinda be careful about this,\nlike, hm, one page wide?\n\n327\n00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:53.520\nPretty good, let's go ahead and\nmake it tall.\n\n328\n00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.880\nBut once you do this you click back here.\n\n329\n00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:59.200\nAnd then you say, all right, let's\nturn off the scale and then I'm back.\n\n330\n00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.750\nAnd if you turn off the scale to fit,\nthen you're back to normal.\n\n331\n00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:05.970\nBut I turn it back on, then it's\nback to here, to where it's scaling.\n\n332\n00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:09.485\nKeep that in mind for a minute,\noops I just printed it.\n\n333\n00:19:09.485 --> 00:19:11.550\n[LAUGH] Guess what?\n\n334\n00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:17.520\nThey're gonna be seeing the address list\nwhere we sit and everything like that.\n\n335\n00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:21.780\nBut now when I come back to here and\nI change this back to Automatic, okay?\n\n336\n00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:24.400\nAnd then I change this\nback to Automatic and\n\n337\n00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:28.350\nyou're like,\nthat didn't do anything, right?\n\n338\n00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.570\nYeah, I see you're like?\n\n339\n00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:36.965\nIt didn't, It's all looking the same and\nif I Print Preview and, it's still.\n\n340\n00:19:36.965 --> 00:19:39.765\nNo but\nI told it to stop doing it didn't I?\n\n341\n00:19:39.765 --> 00:19:42.075\nI know.\n&gt;&gt; I don't like this Vonne,\n\n342\n00:19:42.075 --> 00:19:45.035\nthis is one of those things where\nyou're like I'm resetting it back to\n\n343\n00:19:45.035 --> 00:19:46.875\nthe previous settings.\n\n344\n00:19:46.875 --> 00:19:50.870\nAnd it's not doing what I expect it to be.\n\n345\n00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:55.048\nWhen things don't have this logical flow,\nthen this is how you end up with an office\n\n346\n00:19:55.048 --> 00:19:57.730\nfull of printouts that are the wrong size.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n347\n00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:00.670\nthis is where I'm blaming it on\nthe program, I'm like this is a bug.\n\n348\n00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:03.070\nBecause you know what I've been doing.\n\n349\n00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:05.940\nI'm not going to save it, and I'm going\nto close it, and I'm going to start\n\n350\n00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.869\nthe program over, because a good\nrestart will always flip it back.\n\n351\n00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:10.580\nIt still does it.\n\n352\n00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:13.100\nSo then I'm like, it's just this\nprogram is like I'm just gonna wait for\n\n353\n00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.290\nthe next update to fix this.\n\n354\n00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:16.380\nOkay, this is weird, right?\n\n355\n00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:19.750\nWe saw that the check, the scales,\nI turned it back to automatic.\n\n356\n00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:21.300\nIt still didn't do it, okay?\n\n357\n00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:31.660\nI flipped this over to adjust and\nthis is overriding everything.\n\n358\n00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:35.660\nIt's saying that it is 25% of the normal\nsize, and it is stuck on there.\n\n359\n00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:39.850\nI still think this is a little bit of\na bug honestly, but it's like ugh.\n\n360\n00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:43.130\nSo you have to come into here,\nafter you did all of that stuff,\n\n361\n00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:47.340\nyou gotta put this back to 100%,\nregular, normal size.\n\n362\n00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.530\nYou click okay and now,\n\n363\n00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:54.030\nlook, the automatically I switched\nover here, actually works.\n\n364\n00:20:55.660 --> 00:21:02.220\nI don't know, but it drives me crazy.\n&gt;&gt; Vonne, so and that seems to work.\n\n365\n00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:02.960\nI do have a question.\n\n366\n00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.550\nI noticed when we originally\nhad this page and\n\n367\n00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:09.130\nwe opened it up it said\nscale to zero by zero pages.\n\n368\n00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:12.471\nIf we do that and change it back to\nautomatic, do we get the same result or\n\n369\n00:21:12.471 --> 00:21:16.970\nis it always adjust back to 100%?\n&gt;&gt; So if we said, like 0 by 0, and\n\n370\n00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:18.600\nthat was there.\n\n371\n00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:19.670\nI guess I've already change it.\n\n372\n00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:22.900\nSo let's try it again,\nright, we said one page and\n\n373\n00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.420\nthen one page.\n\n374\n00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:25.030\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n375\n00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:28.330\nSo now we can,\nwe know that it's, oops, sorry.\n\n376\n00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:31.600\nI got back in the header of that part,\ncool, right?\n\n377\n00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.350\nSo now you say go back in here, okay?\n\n378\n00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:38.051\nAnd fit back to zero by zero?\n\n379\n00:21:38.051 --> 00:21:40.541\nLet's try it.\n\n380\n00:21:40.541 --> 00:21:43.342\nIt's still stuck.\n\n381\n00:21:43.342 --> 00:21:46.675\nIsn't that weird?\n&gt;&gt; I don't like that.\n\n382\n00:21:46.675 --> 00:21:47.257\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n383\n00:21:47.257 --> 00:21:51.113\nThat'll drive you, cuz then it\nswitches back to adjust by 25%.\n\n384\n00:21:51.113 --> 00:21:51.929\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n385\n00:21:51.929 --> 00:21:53.014\n&gt;&gt; That's odd, I don't like that.\n\n386\n00:21:53.014 --> 00:21:57.927\nIt's a [SOUND].\n&gt;&gt; These are the types of things that\n\n387\n00:21:57.927 --> 00:22:00.700\nmake me scream at my computer and\npeople look at me weird.\n\n388\n00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.786\n&gt;&gt; I can't say that I haven't done that\n\n389\n00:22:03.786 --> 00:22:04.590\neither.\n\n390\n00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:08.560\nYeah, it is a drive you crazy thing.\n\n391\n00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.950\nAnd it's more of a Mac thing.\n\n392\n00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:14.935\nI don't nearly have the same\nproblems in PC, sorry.\n\n393\n00:22:14.935 --> 00:22:18.700\nBut you know, go to your page setup.\n\n394\n00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:21.240\nChange back to 100%, reset it.\n\n395\n00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.927\nAnd honestly I could have just stop and\njust said yeah just put it to one page and\n\n396\n00:22:24.927 --> 00:22:25.850\nnow you're fine.\n\n397\n00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:28.020\nBut I wanted to show you how that works,\nokay?\n\n398\n00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.110\nSo that it can get a little weird.\n\n399\n00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:34.130\nSo definitely go back and\nforth that you know where it lives.\n\n400\n00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:36.810\nAnd you know you can always go back\nto 100% and then start over and\n\n401\n00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:38.640\nthen resize how everything goes.\n\n402\n00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:41.970\nCuz sometimes you might want it all in\none page, a lot of times you don't.\n\n403\n00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.370\nThat's a blanket statement\nthat I shouldn't probably say.\n\n404\n00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:48.780\nLet's move on to those print titles,\nright?\n\n405\n00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:50.470\nPrint titles are amazing, I love them and\n\n406\n00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:54.510\nthey're really pretty simple,\nmight as well say.\n\n407\n00:22:54.510 --> 00:23:00.715\nI want this top row to repeat\non every printed page.\n\n408\n00:23:00.715 --> 00:23:03.670\nThat's just something I want to do.\n\n409\n00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:05.710\nSo how do you set a print title?\n\n410\n00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:08.060\nYou click on Print Title and\n\n411\n00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:12.180\nit actually takes you into the page\nsetup into the Sheet options.\n\n412\n00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:16.390\nPrint titles, it's what you want\nto repeat on every printed page,\n\n413\n00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:21.410\nwhether you want it to repeat at the top\nor you want it to repeat on the left.\n\n414\n00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:25.360\nThink about if you had a worksheet\ngoing this way instead of this way.\n\n415\n00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.180\nSo you click your cursor in there,\nthat's always step one.\n\n416\n00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.370\nYou must click that cursor.\n\n417\n00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:33.070\nYou come outside of here and\n\n418\n00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:38.670\nthen notice how I want to select\na row to repeat at the top.\n\n419\n00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:40.380\nSo I click just on Row 1.\n\n420\n00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:43.630\nAnd by the way,\nif you have two rows, three rows,\n\n421\n00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:45.940\nyou would just select Rows 1,\n2 and 3, okay?\n\n422\n00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:49.150\nDon't worry about that kind of collapsing.\n\n423\n00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:50.750\nNope, I just want one.\n\n424\n00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:52.680\nOops, actually careful about that.\n\n425\n00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:57.870\nSo once I did a range and\nI just want one, $ is absolute, row.\n\n426\n00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:01.138\nAnd then I click OK.\n\n427\n00:24:01.138 --> 00:24:06.538\nYou know what, just delete that\nall out together, it is one,\n\n428\n00:24:06.538 --> 00:24:11.340\nsorry, one, three,\none is what I want it to be, sorry.\n\n429\n00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:12.472\nYou were just waiting on that,\n\n430\n00:24:12.472 --> 00:24:15.554\nweren't you Justin.\n&gt;&gt; I am not trying to say I revel in your\n\n431\n00:24:15.554 --> 00:24:19.330\nmiseries sometimes, but well,\nwe all have hiccups, and\n\n432\n00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:24.370\nactually that, I feel like both\nof those should have worked.\n\n433\n00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:27.980\nNow I don't use Excel formulas\nall the time, but one to one and\n\n434\n00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:33.090\njust one, eh, kind of the same.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I feel you there,\n\n435\n00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:34.810\nespecially since I tried to delete it and\nit didn't work.\n\n436\n00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:38.759\nBut now you're gonna see that I have\nprint titles on each printed page, so\n\n437\n00:24:38.759 --> 00:24:41.640\nmuch easier,\nespecially if you're doing a report.\n\n438\n00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:46.501\nThat's a lot of pages, take that row\nat the top or take the column and\n\n439\n00:24:46.501 --> 00:24:50.112\nprint that, love me a print title,\nreally cool.\n\n440\n00:24:50.112 --> 00:24:55.960\nI'm gonna go over to the page breaks,\nnow, where's the page breaking?\n\n441\n00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:00.460\nNaturally, or automatically based on like,\nhey I got to here and\n\n442\n00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:04.200\nI can't fit any more, so\nguess what, going to another page.\n\n443\n00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.190\nSometimes you don't want that.\n\n444\n00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:12.670\nMaybe, I would like up to let's just say,\nSasha.\n\n445\n00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:16.300\nI want Sasha to be the end\nentry on page one.\n\n446\n00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:20.177\nAnd then Tootsie,\nstill misspelled [LAUGH],\n\n447\n00:25:20.177 --> 00:25:22.210\nI want that one to be on the next page.\n\n448\n00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:27.940\nThis is where you insert a page break,\nyou can do it through this view.\n\n449\n00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:31.340\nI will tell you, I've had this\none I've had a little glitch.\n\n450\n00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:33.870\nSo if it glitches just go\nback into normal view.\n\n451\n00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:38.400\nYou have to think about,\nI said Sasha was the last one, right?\n\n452\n00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.010\nSo 62, Tootsie is the first one.\n\n453\n00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:48.610\nYou click on that particular row and\nthen you go to page break.\n\n454\n00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:54.680\nAnd then you insert a page break and\nnotice that,\n\n455\n00:25:54.680 --> 00:26:01.180\nSasha was the last entry on page one,\nand this is the next page, okay.\n\n456\n00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:04.390\nI will tell you that I tend to,\n\n457\n00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:07.680\nif I'm gonna do page breaks,\nI don't like to be in any of these views.\n\n458\n00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:11.930\nGuess what, there's a whole other view for\npage breaks.\n\n459\n00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:16.900\nSo much easier here, so it's tiny,\nyou're not supposed to read the text.\n\n460\n00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:20.730\nBut notice how I have Page 1,\nit took out my.\n\n461\n00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:22.177\nSee?\nThis is where remember I told you it was\n\n462\n00:26:22.177 --> 00:26:22.790\na little glitchy?\n\n463\n00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:27.660\nWhen I'm in Page Layout, it took out that\nmanual page break that I just had, so I.\n\n464\n00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:32.040\nNope, it's right there,\nI was on the wrong page.\n\n465\n00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:33.135\nI thought it was a lot higher up.\n\n466\n00:26:33.135 --> 00:26:35.410\nI was, wasn't I?\n&gt;&gt; No, I think you just clicked off of it.\n\n467\n00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:37.420\nIt was like a green highlight.\n\n468\n00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:40.522\nLike it still had the row highlighted,\nbut it didn't show the page break, and\n\n469\n00:26:40.522 --> 00:26:43.436\nwhen you clicked off of it, it became\na solid blue line that showed the page\n\n470\n00:26:43.436 --> 00:26:47.030\nbreak.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I didn't like it, page out and\n\n471\n00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:49.480\npage breaks are kinda weird,\nI will just tell you right now.\n\n472\n00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:53.120\nI would just go right into here and\nbe like, where do I want to pull this.\n\n473\n00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.632\nI'm just gonna say I want\nto break the page here,\n\n474\n00:26:55.632 --> 00:27:01.200\nmeaning that Mocha, I know it's\nhard to read, is the next page and\n\n475\n00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:06.210\nthen I can select it, go to page layout,\nand insert a Page Break.\n\n476\n00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:09.360\nAnd notice that this view\nmakes it a lot easier.\n\n477\n00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:14.960\nNow once you get your Page Breaks in here,\nnow the solid line is a manual Page Break.\n\n478\n00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:20.190\nThe dotted lines are your automatic Page\nBreaks, but do you see it's kind of hard.\n\n479\n00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:23.611\nBut do you see if I hover over it,\nI can actually pull this and\n\n480\n00:27:23.611 --> 00:27:26.140\nnow it becomes a manual page break.\n\n481\n00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:30.224\nSo this is kind of fun, where I could\ntake this and say alright well,\n\n482\n00:27:30.224 --> 00:27:32.780\nI want to go ahead and move that to there.\n\n483\n00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:34.720\nThen I'm going to move\nthis up a little bit.\n\n484\n00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.620\nWe can take that manual page break,\nand move this up.\n\n485\n00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:41.181\nI can zoom out even more,\nto kind of get a bird's eye view,\n\n486\n00:27:41.181 --> 00:27:43.020\nof where I want these to move.\n\n487\n00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:47.386\nAnd I can just move these blue lines,\nso I can kind of help move around,\n\n488\n00:27:47.386 --> 00:27:49.914\nwhere the Page Breaks are gonna happen.\n\n489\n00:27:49.914 --> 00:27:53.693\nI love page break preview when it\ncomes to this and it's a lot easier by\n\n490\n00:27:53.693 --> 00:27:56.743\npulling those lines down.\n&gt;&gt; And, you know what's kind of\n\n491\n00:27:56.743 --> 00:28:01.375\ninteresting about that UI, right now it\nsays page 1,2,3,4 the text that displays\n\n492\n00:28:01.375 --> 00:28:06.810\nfor page 1,2,3,4,5 Is size relative\nto how much is on that page.\n\n493\n00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:10.443\nIf you actually move that,\nare text size changes.\n\n494\n00:28:10.443 --> 00:28:11.540\n&gt;&gt; Let me look at that.\n\n495\n00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:12.130\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n496\n00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:16.150\n&gt;&gt; I don't think I've ever noticed that.\n\n497\n00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:18.777\n&gt;&gt; So we'll give you a relative magnitude\n\n498\n00:28:18.777 --> 00:28:21.330\n[CROSSTALK] of how much is on each page.\n\n499\n00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:23.066\nSo if you can just match those sizes,\n\n500\n00:28:23.066 --> 00:28:26.740\nyou don't have to worry about\ngetting the lines exactly right.\n\n501\n00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:28.655\nIt would compromise.\n&gt;&gt; I don't think I've ever noticed that.\n\n502\n00:28:28.655 --> 00:28:31.645\n[LAUGH] That's really cool, thanks Justin.\n\n503\n00:28:31.645 --> 00:28:34.340\n[LAUGH] Good job.\n\n504\n00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:38.510\nSo yeah, these are great ways to go\nahead and change how your pages break.\n\n505\n00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:41.790\nThe thing is sometimes,\nyou just get it all sorts of wrong.\n\n506\n00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:44.080\nCan I just go back to the way\nit did it automatically?\n\n507\n00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:48.450\nYou go to breaks and\nthen you can just reset all of them.\n\n508\n00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:52.310\nYou could also remove a single one,\nlike if I wanted to,\n\n509\n00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:54.280\nbut I like to just reset them all, and\n\n510\n00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:58.920\nthen it just goes back to the way you\ncan automatically do your page breaks.\n\n511\n00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:01.320\nThat can be really, really nice to have.\n\n512\n00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:07.010\nSo, like the page breaks, I guess\nthe last thing that I wanted to show you,\n\n513\n00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:10.910\nI'm gonna go back over to my normal view,\nis print areas,\n\n514\n00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:13.600\nI will tell you, I don't like print areas.\n\n515\n00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:17.180\nI don't know why,\nI just never really got in the hang of it.\n\n516\n00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:23.020\nWhat a print area means, is that you're\ndesignating an area to become the only\n\n517\n00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:24.140\nthing that prints on the sheet.\n\n518\n00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:31.010\nWhen I come back to here, notice that I\nhave some options of the active sheets,\n\n519\n00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:34.360\nor I can do the entire work if I want to,\nor I can do a selection.\n\n520\n00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.820\nLet's do the selection really quickly,\nI know we're about out of time.\n\n521\n00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:41.580\nSo let me just do this,\njust stay with me for\n\n522\n00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:45.730\na little bit longer, cuz I don't wanna\ndo it part three with five minutes.\n\n523\n00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:49.990\nSo I come here, I only want this part\nto be printed, I just make a selection,\n\n524\n00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:51.970\ndo the print.\n\n525\n00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:54.530\nNotice that it's not\ndoing that by default,\n\n526\n00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:58.350\nyou gotta change what\nyou want to selection.\n\n527\n00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:01.590\nPerfect, that's exactly what I wanted,\nI only want that to be printed.\n\n528\n00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:08.160\nBut I can see, like if you're always\ngoing to just be printing this part out,\n\n529\n00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:11.930\njust this one section,\nyou can make this one as a print area.\n\n530\n00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:16.370\nSo you select it, you come over to the\nPrint Layout, and you go to Print Area.\n\n531\n00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:19.980\nAnd you set it, when you set the print\narea, I'm gonna click off of it.\n\n532\n00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:24.710\nDo you see this kind of gray\nbox-looking thing right there?\n\n533\n00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:29.630\nThat's indicating your print area,\nit also becomes a named range.\n\n534\n00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.070\nKeep all this in mind for just a second.\n\n535\n00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:36.590\nWhen I go to print, it says print\nactive sheets, but what do I see here,\n\n536\n00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:39.210\nthat's not the whole sheet here, is it?\n\n537\n00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:40.910\nNo, and that's the thing that bothers me,\n\n538\n00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:45.960\nis because when you set a print area, it\nwill always over ride the sheet setting.\n\n539\n00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:48.750\nIt will always be print area, and\n\n540\n00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:52.570\nyou notice you don't have an option\nin here for print area, do you?\n\n541\n00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:55.740\nYou're like, so why isn't it working,\nwhy can't I get the active sheets?\n\n542\n00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:59.180\nAnd if this has ever thrown you off,\ncuz it saves with the file,\n\n543\n00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:01.650\nyou're like I just want the whole sheet.\n\n544\n00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:05.430\nSomebody has print areas\non that particular file.\n\n545\n00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:12.070\nSo knowing what they are is one thing,\nseeing the lines, how do I select it?\n\n546\n00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:14.170\nSo notice it says print area.\n\n547\n00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:16.450\nSo that's where it's a named range, but\n\n548\n00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:19.050\nthe biggest thing is like I\nwant you to print the sheet.\n\n549\n00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:23.290\nStop overwriting it cuz it always will,\nyou come up to print area and\n\n550\n00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:24.460\nyou clear it.\n\n551\n00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:28.560\nAnd once you clear it now when I print,\nthe whole page,\n\n552\n00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:31.220\nsorry, sheet will print out.\n\n553\n00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:34.090\nThat's why I've never like print areas\nbecause I don't like the overwriting.\n\n554\n00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:38.100\nIf I want something, I'll either hide\ncolumns, hide rows, make a selection and\n\n555\n00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:39.290\nsay, print selection to me.\n\n556\n00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:40.617\nI have way more control, and\n\n557\n00:31:40.617 --> 00:31:43.370\nit doesn't throw me off.\n&gt;&gt; That was actually enough.\n\n558\n00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:45.460\nFollow up question about print areas.\n\n559\n00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:48.040\nDo they have to be contiguous?\n\n560\n00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:51.970\nAs far, so can I select and select\nindividual pieces, and then set a print\n\n561\n00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:54.470\narea based on those disparate selections?\n\n562\n00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:55.960\n&gt;&gt; Like, here?\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n563\n00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:58.295\n&gt;&gt; So now I have these two things.\n\n564\n00:31:58.295 --> 00:32:02.088\n[CROSSTALK] It will print that and there.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n565\n00:32:02.088 --> 00:32:04.080\na bunch of empty space.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n566\n00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.479\nThat's not good.\n&gt;&gt; It's a second sheet.\n\n567\n00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:09.030\n&gt;&gt; Naw, cuz what I was thinking is,\n\n568\n00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:10.990\nmaybe it's an alternative to show and\nhide, right?\n\n569\n00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:15.910\nAnd that would make sense, but\nif you select non-contiguous\n\n570\n00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:20.207\nblocks it goes well there is a space here,\nwe're just not gonna show you what it is.\n\n571\n00:32:20.207 --> 00:32:21.490\n[LAUGH] And it does weird things.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n572\n00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:24.550\nthat might be a reason why you want to do\nit, because I'm always gonna print this\n\n573\n00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:26.650\nand this, but\nI want it on page one and page two.\n\n574\n00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:30.120\nGreat, go ahead and send it, okay, And\nif you wanted to include more of it,\n\n575\n00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:30.800\nthat's fine.\n\n576\n00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:35.040\nBut to me it just, I don't like,\nthat's why I don't like.\n\n577\n00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:40.370\nIt overrides my sheet print option,\n\n578\n00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:44.380\nand that's why I've just never\ngotten on board with Print Areas.\n\n579\n00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:46.620\nSo, that's just personal preference.\n\n580\n00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:50.540\nYou can do it if you want, and\nit can hopefully save you a lot of time.\n\n581\n00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:53.750\nBut, do you have another question, Justin?\n&gt;&gt; I do have one more question.\n\n582\n00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:56.640\nSo, and\nmaybe this has been on another episode.\n\n583\n00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:59.970\nBut we talked about those row headers,\nright, that are printed on each sheet.\n\n584\n00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:02.770\nThere's a check box right up\nthere that says Headings.\n\n585\n00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:07.400\nAre those the same thing or am I mistaken?\n&gt;&gt; Those are the headings\n\n586\n00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:08.540\nof like the a, b, c.\n\n587\n00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:14.680\nIf I print those, now it's going to print\nout columns a, b, row one, two, three.\n\n588\n00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:17.710\nSo it's the actual Excel Headings.\n\n589\n00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:22.640\nThese are print titles, so\nthat's the repeating row that I\n\n590\n00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:26.980\nwant to repeat at the top, or repeating\ncolumn that I want to print on every page.\n\n591\n00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:31.645\nSo, it's a, you were close but not really.\n\n592\n00:33:31.645 --> 00:33:32.360\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n593\n00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:35.380\nI can see how you would mix that up,\nI would probably check that box and\n\n594\n00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:38.460\ngo print, and\nno I want this to repeat, right?\n\n595\n00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:43.360\nI'm essentially getting the grid layout,\nfor the Excel sheet on every page.\n\n596\n00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:46.960\nBut I want the first row and\nthe left most column, or\n\n597\n00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:49.560\nwhatever it may be,\nto print out on every sheet.\n\n598\n00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:51.247\nSo I just had to ask that question.\n\n599\n00:33:51.247 --> 00:33:55.880\nVonne, you've definitely illustrated some,\na few got you's that could be frustrating.\n\n600\n00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:59.210\nBut now that you've shown us, well,\nwe're not gonna be frustrated anymore.\n\n601\n00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:03.340\nThere was a lot going on ther, but,\nincredibly important when you are thinking\n\n602\n00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:06.950\nabout, I need to send this as PDF,\nor an email, or print this out.\n\n603\n00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:10.320\nYou know, actually go a board meeting or\nsomething, I don't know.\n\n604\n00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:13.090\nBut, thank you so much and\nthank you for joining us.\n\n605\n00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:14.180\nWe are going to get heck out of here.\n\n606\n00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:17.950\nSo, signing off for OfficeProTV, I'm your\nhost Justin Dennison and I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n607\n00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:18.530\nAnd we'll see you next time.\n\n608\n00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:25.600\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.064 --> 00:00:17.750\nI'm your host Justin Dennison,\n\n4\n00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.309\nand we're continuing on with our\nExcel 2016 essentials for Mac.\n\n5\n00:00:21.309 --> 00:00:25.609\nAnd well, we're going to be looking\nat managing workbooks and worksheets,\n\n6\n00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.461\nthose two words that I tend to always\nmix them up, and you may as well.\n\n7\n00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:33.020\nBut luckily we have someone\nthat's going to make sure we get\n\n8\n00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.015\neverything we need with workbooks and\nworksheets and well, managing.\n\n9\n00:00:37.015 --> 00:00:38.798\nMs. Vonne Smith,\nhow are you doing today, Vonne?\n\n10\n00:00:38.798 --> 00:00:40.485\n&gt;&gt; I feel like you're setting me up.\n\n11\n00:00:40.485 --> 00:00:44.030\n[LAUGH] Everything, ooh,\nI don't know about that one.\n\n12\n00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.440\n&gt;&gt; All right, so as a programmer,\nI tend to over promise and under deliver.\n\n13\n00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.820\nSo we're just gonna have to go with it,\nright?\n\n14\n00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.551\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes,\n\n15\n00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:53.360\nno, but you are right,\nI mess them up all the time, too.\n\n16\n00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.800\nBut we are going to be managing our\nworksheets within our workbooks.\n\n17\n00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.050\nSo we'll cover all of that, yeah,\nI guess we will cover everything here.\n\n18\n00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.009\nAnd this is a fun episode, I always\nlike this one cuz this is the one where\n\n19\n00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.737\nI show people just very kind of,\nI would consider the basic things.\n\n20\n00:01:12.737 --> 00:01:15.380\nThey're like, ooh, that's how you do that.\n\n21\n00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.485\nAnd they get really excited, and\nthen they go and color code everything,\n\n22\n00:01:18.485 --> 00:01:20.505\nwhich is perfect because\nthat's what I do too.\n\n23\n00:01:20.505 --> 00:01:24.325\nSo we're just gonna be working\nwith the worksheet tabs.\n\n24\n00:01:24.325 --> 00:01:26.130\nWhew, that is a mouthful.\n\n25\n00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.940\nAnd you know, why don't we just\nget started, and have something so\n\n26\n00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.000\nI can demonstrate while I talk.\n\n27\n00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.910\nSo, things out the bottom, let's go\nahead and jump down into my workbook.\n\n28\n00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.300\nI have my file called managing,\nor no, what does that say?\n\n29\n00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.680\nManaged worksheets, okay.\n\n30\n00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.190\nAnd we've got this, you've seen probably\nthe same information on all these files,\n\n31\n00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.143\nI just rename them differently for\ndifferent shows, or I guess episodes.\n\n32\n00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:56.453\nWe have worksheet 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\n33\n00:01:56.453 --> 00:01:58.974\nWe know how to navigate them\nbecause we talked about that.\n\n34\n00:01:58.974 --> 00:02:00.159\nWe just click on them, right?\n\n35\n00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.852\nAnd we click, and we click, and we go.\n\n36\n00:02:02.852 --> 00:02:05.918\nI don't know what's on sheet 2,\nor sheet 1, or\n\n37\n00:02:05.918 --> 00:02:08.820\nsheet 3, that is not a very good name.\n\n38\n00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.280\nAnd you saw in the Christmas cats\nexample that they had different names.\n\n39\n00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.810\nThey actually had different colors,\nall right?\n\n40\n00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.557\nYeah, that's what we're gonna do.\n\n41\n00:02:16.557 --> 00:02:17.660\nWe're gonna manage our worksheets.\n\n42\n00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.740\nFirst thing, renaming, all right?\n\n43\n00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.850\nJustin and I are just talking about\nthis before the show started, and\n\n44\n00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.530\nyou found out the shortcuts, didn't you?\n\n45\n00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.504\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, I found out that\nyou can double-click them.\n\n46\n00:02:33.504 --> 00:02:37.489\nAnd yeah, I've been right clicking and\nrenaming and just, I don't know,\n\n47\n00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.613\nit's those small gains in productivity\nthat are wins, but you also feel bad.\n\n48\n00:02:41.613 --> 00:02:44.145\nCuz you're like,\nman why wasn't I doing it this way before?\n\n49\n00:02:44.145 --> 00:02:47.426\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I feel the same way,\nmaybe not about the worksheet tabs, but\n\n50\n00:02:47.426 --> 00:02:48.491\nI've done that too.\n\n51\n00:02:48.491 --> 00:02:50.950\nWhere you're just like [NOISE], years,\n\n52\n00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.156\nyears I've been doing it another\nway that was taking so much longer.\n\n53\n00:02:55.156 --> 00:03:00.016\nBut we're all creatures of habit, we get\ninto that's just the way you do it, and\n\n54\n00:03:00.016 --> 00:03:01.760\nthen you find a new way.\n\n55\n00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.160\nAnd yeah, it changes your world,\n\n56\n00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.700\nbut it also kinda rocks your\nworld a little bit too.\n\n57\n00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.810\nSo yeah, double-clicking,\na lot of people find this by mistake.\n\n58\n00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.420\nBecause they single click to select but\nthen they double-click and\n\n59\n00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.280\nthey're like, what just happened?\n\n60\n00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.060\nYou just got into the renaming\nof the worksheets.\n\n61\n00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.130\nAnd you know that you're renaming because,\nI'll just single click and\n\n62\n00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.990\nthen double-click it again,\nnotice that it highlights the text.\n\n63\n00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.300\nAnd the sheet becomes to where it\nlooks like an I-beam over the text so\n\n64\n00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.870\nyou could go ahead and type.\n\n65\n00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.390\nSo while it's all selected,\nif I wanted to, you know what?\n\n66\n00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.840\nJustin, you're going to be sheet two,\nall right.\n\n67\n00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.920\nSo then I go ahead and type in Justin,\n\n68\n00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.370\nwell then how do you\ncommit the changes to it?\n\n69\n00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.140\nI always just tell people to hit enter,\n\n70\n00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.730\nand when you hit enter,\nit brings it to where yep, there you go.\n\n71\n00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.800\nSo if I double click on sheet three,\n\n72\n00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.700\nwe'll name this Fuego,\njust can't think of anything else to say.\n\n73\n00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.400\nYou can also just click off of that and\n\n74\n00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.580\nit goes ahead and\ncommits those changes as well.\n\n75\n00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.940\nFew things though on your sheet names.\n\n76\n00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:09.472\nIf I take this here on Sheet 5,\nif you double click,\n\n77\n00:04:09.472 --> 00:04:13.341\nwhat if I try to do, Cats Meow.\n\n78\n00:04:13.341 --> 00:04:17.916\nAnd, wait, I forgot, [LAUGH] dashes\nare accepted, I was trying to,\n\n79\n00:04:17.916 --> 00:04:22.569\nyou know what, it's not the dash,\nit's the, whoops, double click,\n\n80\n00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:26.029\nlet me just,\nI just use my arrow keys to get the slash.\n\n81\n00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:27.980\nThat's what I was trying to do.\n\n82\n00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.060\nis that there are a few things that\nyou can't have in sheet names, okay?\n\n83\n00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.082\nYou can't have what looks\nlike the backslash,\n\n84\n00:04:35.082 --> 00:04:39.490\nforward slash, question marks,\nasterisks, or the angled brackets.\n\n85\n00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.930\nBecause I do know that those are specific\ncommands or syntaxes that I believe\n\n86\n00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.810\nare in certain maybe probably vba or\nsome type of coding that is associated.\n\n87\n00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.510\nI just can't do that.\n\n88\n00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.080\nSo you have that with file names and\n\n89\n00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.050\nthings in certain platform that\nthese are just reserved characters.\n\n90\n00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.680\n&gt;&gt; But since we have the actual square\nbrackets, what about the curly braces?\n\n91\n00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.670\nCan I put curly brace curly brace?\n\n92\n00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.040\nBecause coming from a different\nbackground, I'm like well,\n\n93\n00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.010\ncurly braces are probably in there,\nas well.\n\n94\n00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.712\nBut it looks like those are fine?\n\n95\n00:05:12.712 --> 00:05:16.015\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was like,\nJustin's trying to break things again.\n\n96\n00:05:16.015 --> 00:05:17.760\n[LAUGH] But no, that's true.\n\n97\n00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.740\nI was honestly thinking it\nwas gonna throw an error, but\n\n98\n00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.050\nit looks like curly braces are fine,\nor the squiggly brackets.\n\n99\n00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.860\nThat's what I call them.\n\n100\n00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.520\nI always do that what I go for, but\njust in case, it will give you warning.\n\n101\n00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.570\nThat's when things people like trying\nto put in dates if your worksheet tabs,\n\n102\n00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.190\nwell you can't put the slashes but\nyou can put the dashes.\n\n103\n00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.020\nSo do know about that.\n\n104\n00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.300\nSo that's just renaming your worksheets,\nthat's great so we can come through and\n\n105\n00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.800\nrename all of them if I wanted to.\n\n106\n00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.020\nAnd I have my caps lock on.\n\n107\n00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.880\nWe'll just say, addresses,\nand we'll just stop there.\n\n108\n00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.860\nWe don't have to rename\nevery single one of them.\n\n109\n00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.670\n&gt;&gt; I am going to ask a question that\nmay require us to rename another one.\n\n110\n00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.279\nI noticed that the actual tab\ngot larger as you rename.\n\n111\n00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.670\nHowever if I just kinda lean on\nthe keyboard and avoid the disallowed\n\n112\n00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:12.750\ncharacters, is there a finite limit\nto how long the tab names can be?\n\n113\n00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.630\n&gt;&gt; When you started asking I'm like\nhe's gonna ask about the length.\n\n114\n00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:22.540\nI don't know honestly, I'm gonna throw\nout 256, that sounds reasonable.\n\n115\n00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.210\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That seems like a reasonable guess\n\n116\n00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:24.720\nto me.\n\n117\n00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.580\nI didn't know if it would\njust start truncating, or\n\n118\n00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.020\nif it would throw an error,\nor whatever it may be.\n\n119\n00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.110\nBecause I could see people\ntyping a sentence, right?\n\n120\n00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.733\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Just [NOISE], and you gotta be careful,\n\n121\n00:06:36.733 --> 00:06:39.772\ncuz if it's too long,\nthen you make it weirdness.\n\n122\n00:06:39.772 --> 00:06:42.270\n&gt;&gt; This is, you know what?\n\n123\n00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:46.900\nWhile I'm doing this,\nSheet1 in Excel, yeah,\n\n124\n00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.240\nit took all that and like you said,\nthe worksheet tab got longer.\n\n125\n00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.300\nYou know what I would do?\n\n126\n00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.720\nI would look that up.\n\n127\n00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.259\nWhy don't I give you that task there,\nJustin,\n\n128\n00:06:56.259 --> 00:07:00.698\nof looking up the character\nlength of a work sheet in Excel?\n\n129\n00:07:02.475 --> 00:07:04.065\nHowever you're gonna figure that out.\n\n130\n00:07:04.065 --> 00:07:05.400\n[LAUGH] But yeah, I really don't know.\n\n131\n00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.130\nSo I'm actually very\ncurious to know that too.\n\n132\n00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.500\nBut yes, it will go ahead and\nextend itself.\n\n133\n00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.590\nNow when you get to a certain point,\nif you start adding more sheets which I'm\n\n134\n00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.990\ngonna show you how to do, then it's\nonly gonna show you however many across.\n\n135\n00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:21.160\nYou're gonna have to start navigating\nthrough your sheets from here.\n\n136\n00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:26.460\nThese little bumpy buttons, if I have a\nworksheet that has maybe 18 months in it,\n\n137\n00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.590\nit might not be able to\ndisplay all 18 tabs on there.\n\n138\n00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:34.500\nSo you will have to navigate through\nthere to be able to click on them.\n\n139\n00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:39.960\nSpeaking of renaming and the size,\nanother thing that I really like to do\n\n140\n00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:46.410\nis I like to color code everything,\njust add a little pizzaz in there.\n\n141\n00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:49.190\nHow can I change the color?\n\n142\n00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:51.040\nThat is by right clicking, Justin.\n\n143\n00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.476\nAnd if I right click on a tab,\nnotice that there's a couple of options.\n\n144\n00:07:55.476 --> 00:07:59.007\nThere's rename,\nwhich Justin has been doing for years,\n\n145\n00:07:59.007 --> 00:08:03.632\nthere's also tab color, and then I can\ngo ahead and start changing Colors.\n\n146\n00:08:03.632 --> 00:08:05.255\nNotice you do have your theme colors.\n\n147\n00:08:05.255 --> 00:08:07.881\nSo if your theme changes,\nthen your colors will change too.\n\n148\n00:08:07.881 --> 00:08:12.198\nBut these are more of like, hey, I want\nthis to be purple, and then, there you go,\n\n149\n00:08:12.198 --> 00:08:13.020\nit's purple.\n\n150\n00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:14.770\nBut notice when I click off of it,\n\n151\n00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:17.840\nnow it just kind of puts that\nlittle line across the top.\n\n152\n00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:22.910\nAnd if I go ahead and then make\nthis yellow and then make this red,\n\n153\n00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:26.080\nokay, so now you can see that it's\ngoing ahead and doing the colors.\n\n154\n00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.126\nThe cool thing that they've changed,\nwhich I like.\n\n155\n00:08:28.126 --> 00:08:32.960\nAnd notice that if it's not the active\nsheet, the color goes to the top.\n\n156\n00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.880\nWhen it's on the active sheet it goes\nahead and puts it at the bottom.\n\n157\n00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.070\nAnd so now you know that this is the one.\n\n158\n00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:43.380\nBut do notice like, see how it also\nchanges the font color on this worksheet?\n\n159\n00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:46.630\nBut doesn't change on that one,\ncuz yellow's hard to see.\n\n160\n00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:50.420\nSo not all of your tab colors\nwill show up in the font.\n\n161\n00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.600\nIt's just one of those\nweird things about like,\n\n162\n00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.860\nthere's probably some limit like\na brightness level on a site.\n\n163\n00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:59.300\nIf it's this, it's not gonna\nshow the color, if it's this,\n\n164\n00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.540\nit will show the color.\n\n165\n00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.830\nI don't know if that's how it works,\n\n166\n00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:05.910\nI've just noticed not all colors\nare gonna show up in the font name.\n\n167\n00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.490\n&gt;&gt; It seems like one of those things where\nthey've done an exorbitant amount of\n\n168\n00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:09.387\nstudies in order to go.\n\n169\n00:09:09.387 --> 00:09:13.960\nThese color palettes, when composed of\nthese relative magnitudes of red, green,\n\n170\n00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.340\nand blue or whatever they are, right?\n\n171\n00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:19.620\nCyan, magenta, yellow and CYN, yeah.\n\n172\n00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:20.850\n&gt;&gt; Black.\n&gt;&gt; Black?\n\n173\n00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:22.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Variant, whatever it may be,\n\n174\n00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:28.470\nif you don't have those, then the eye\ncan't resolve like text letters very well.\n\n175\n00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:32.270\nBut follow up, I went and\ncompleted your little task.\n\n176\n00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:33.300\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and what did you find out?\n\n177\n00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:37.760\n&gt;&gt; And I found out that if you\nstart typing, eventually Excel,\n\n178\n00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.660\nthe new version I have the update as well,\nit just stops letting you type.\n\n179\n00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.450\n&gt;&gt; Yep, it just stops.\n\n180\n00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:45.270\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n181\n00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:48.348\n&gt;&gt; And so I took that, and\nI used Excel to find how long it was.\n\n182\n00:09:48.348 --> 00:09:49.604\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n183\n00:09:49.604 --> 00:09:53.620\nso it was a little meta there,\nI got 31 characters.\n\n184\n00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:54.220\n&gt;&gt; 31?\n&gt;&gt; 31.\n\n185\n00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:55.080\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n\n186\n00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:55.918\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n187\n00:09:55.918 --> 00:09:57.640\n&gt;&gt; That's way shorter than\nI thought it would be.\n\n188\n00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\nit was shorter than I thought, as well.\n\n189\n00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.370\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well then there you go.\n\n190\n00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:03.285\nThere you have it, folks, 31.\n\n191\n00:10:03.285 --> 00:10:05.740\n[LAUGHTER] What a weird number.\n\n192\n00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:09.560\nOkay but I do like what you said,\nit will just stop, okay.\n\n193\n00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.310\nAnd there you go, so that's how\nlong you get in your sheet names,\n\n194\n00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:15.730\nit will just not have anymore room.\n\n195\n00:10:17.042 --> 00:10:20.620\nAll right, so we have got the color,\nwe have got the renaming.\n\n196\n00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:21.950\nWhat if I need to change the order?\n\n197\n00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:24.570\nThis happens to me all of the time,\nI wanna move things around.\n\n198\n00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:28.431\nSo if I wanted to put in front of Justin,\nright?\n\n199\n00:10:28.431 --> 00:10:29.568\nHow do I do it?\n\n200\n00:10:29.568 --> 00:10:31.450\nIt’s actually easier than you think.\n\n201\n00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:34.076\nYou just click hold and you drag.\n\n202\n00:10:34.076 --> 00:10:37.950\nAnd as soon as I do that, notice how,\nand I'll probably zoom in after this, so\n\n203\n00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:38.870\nyou can see this.\n\n204\n00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:43.490\nNotice how when I click and hold it\njust brings up this little triangle and\n\n205\n00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:46.660\nthen I can move it to\nwherever I want it to be.\n\n206\n00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:49.330\nAnd if I wanted it to be between here,\nI let go and\n\n207\n00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.240\nthat's where that particular\nworksheet goes, that's it.\n\n208\n00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:56.020\nSo you can rename these all day long, put\nthem in what order you want and so on and\n\n209\n00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:56.545\nso forth.\n\n210\n00:10:56.545 --> 00:11:00.250\nSo that's the easiest way to\nrearrange your worksheets.\n\n211\n00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:01.388\nYou can do it this way.\n\n212\n00:11:01.388 --> 00:11:05.230\nYou can right-click, and\nyou can go to Move or Copy.\n\n213\n00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:10.970\nOnce I go into move or copy, then I\nsay I want Fuego to move to the end.\n\n214\n00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.030\nClick ok, and then it moves to the end.\n\n215\n00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:15.260\nI'm more of a visual person,\nso I'm going to be dragging,\n\n216\n00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.050\nI think it's a lot easier to do.\n\n217\n00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:20.137\nWe'll come back around to\nthat in just a second.\n\n218\n00:11:20.137 --> 00:11:21.800\nWhat if I wanted to make a new worksheet?\n\n219\n00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.337\nThis is almost too simple.\n\n220\n00:11:23.337 --> 00:11:26.670\nLook at that little plus sign right there,\nwhat do you think it's gonna do?\n\n221\n00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:30.050\nYeah, it's gonna add new,\nwell if I click it, there.\n\n222\n00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:32.190\nIt's going to add a new blank worksheet.\n\n223\n00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:33.740\nSo nothing there.\n\n224\n00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:34.370\nSounds good.\n\n225\n00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:37.790\nI can move this around and that's great.\n\n226\n00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:40.440\nWhat if I don't need\nthat worksheet anymore?\n\n227\n00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:47.340\nThen you can right click on it and you can\ndelete it, once you delete it, it's gone.\n\n228\n00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:51.510\nBe careful about this, I'll take the, you\nknow what Justin, guess what, I'm sorry,\n\n229\n00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:53.270\nI'm taking you out.\n\n230\n00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:56.030\nYou're gonna delete,\nthis is what I was looking for.\n\n231\n00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:58.540\nI know, I'm sorry,\nhe's got a really sad face over here.\n\n232\n00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:01.820\nSo, it's okay,\nyou can stay in the episode though.\n\n233\n00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:06.456\n[LAUGH] So notice that right here it's\ngoing to permanently delete this,\n\n234\n00:12:06.456 --> 00:12:08.052\ndo you want to continue?\n\n235\n00:12:08.052 --> 00:12:10.408\nYou cannot undo deleting a worksheet.\n\n236\n00:12:10.408 --> 00:12:12.760\nYou gotta be careful about that.\n\n237\n00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.330\nOnce you click delete, it is gone.\n\n238\n00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:20.160\nIf I tried to go ahead and, look,\nthe undo button is not even on.\n\n239\n00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.450\nI cannot bring a deleted worksheet back,\nso be careful.\n\n240\n00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:26.160\nThat's why it gives you the warning.\n\n241\n00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.890\n&gt;&gt; Speaking of that warning,\nand we don't have an undo.\n\n242\n00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:32.020\nIf we were to modify other worksheets\nwhere we had undos kinda queued up, right,\n\n243\n00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:35.220\nwe have that whole queue of undos\nit would delete a worksheet.\n\n244\n00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.840\nDoes it cut the undo off at that point?\n\n245\n00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.810\nOr does it just skip that undo?\n\n246\n00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:42.770\n&gt;&gt; It looks like you can't go at all,\nthat's just gone.\n\n247\n00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:44.340\nSo that's another good point too.\n\n248\n00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.831\nIt's gonna delete all of\nyour history of your undos.\n\n249\n00:12:47.831 --> 00:12:52.900\nSo yeah, it's a permanent thing in more\nways than one now that I think about it.\n\n250\n00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:56.030\nSo, just be careful about that one.\n\n251\n00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:58.660\nI always think about this,\nand there's always,\n\n252\n00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:02.420\nI always sometimes I make\nbackup copies just in case.\n\n253\n00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:06.650\nBut a lot of times if I'm deleting\nI know I want to get rid of that.\n\n254\n00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:08.340\nSo, be careful about that.\n\n255\n00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:10.670\nTalking about copying a worksheet.\n\n256\n00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:12.790\nThis is one where, for example,\n\n257\n00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:17.100\nlet's go with the of course,\nthe only one I renamed.\n\n258\n00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.460\nSo like, where's my calculations, right?\n\n259\n00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:23.600\nIf these are my weekly sales, well just so\nyou can see this a little better,\n\n260\n00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:29.330\nwe'll just say it's sales for\nJuly, it looks like, right?\n\n261\n00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:33.060\nWell, I'm going to do the same\nthing in August, right?\n\n262\n00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:37.230\nSo I don't wanna have to,\nI could totally like select this,\n\n263\n00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:40.210\ncopy, make a new worksheet, paste.\n\n264\n00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:45.280\nThat's great, but I really just want the\nwhole thing, why just go with the cells?\n\n265\n00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.260\nJust take the whole sheet.\n\n266\n00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:51.530\nIf I right click on this,\nI can copy this worksheet.\n\n267\n00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:53.730\nSo, if I move our copy.\n\n268\n00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:56.102\nI can make sure you check that box off,\n\n269\n00:13:56.102 --> 00:13:59.155\nif you don't check that\nbox all you do is moving.\n\n270\n00:13:59.155 --> 00:14:03.338\nSo I can create a copy,\nmove it to the end if I wanted to.\n\n271\n00:14:03.338 --> 00:14:09.325\nClick OK, and\nnow I've got a whole copy of that sheet.\n\n272\n00:14:09.325 --> 00:14:14.945\nTake this, you rename it, and you name\nit August, and let's see if I can spell.\n\n273\n00:14:14.945 --> 00:14:18.995\nAnd you get rid of that 2 over there,\nand there you go, perfect.\n\n274\n00:14:18.995 --> 00:14:22.037\nAnd I can go ahead and rename the\nworksheet, cuz it's always hot in August\n\n275\n00:14:22.037 --> 00:14:24.800\nso we'll make it red,\neven though I have another one that's red.\n\n276\n00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.500\nAnd then just change out the data and\nso on and so forth.\n\n277\n00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:32.870\nSo I do that all the time,\njust take the whole worksheet and copy it.\n\n278\n00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:37.108\nThere's also a little trick, if you didn't\nwant to do the whole right click and move.\n\n279\n00:14:37.108 --> 00:14:44.130\nIn Mac world to copy is you hold\nyour alt key, or your option key.\n\n280\n00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:48.040\nSo if I took this one, and\nwanted to make a duplicate of it,\n\n281\n00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:52.690\nif I click hold and drag,\nthat's just moving, right?\n\n282\n00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:56.382\nBut if I hold my alt key down,\nclick hold and drag.\n\n283\n00:14:56.382 --> 00:14:59.476\nIt's really small, you can barely see it,\n\n284\n00:14:59.476 --> 00:15:03.670\nthere's the tiniest little\ndot in that little icon.\n\n285\n00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:06.800\nWhen I let go of the mouse,\nI just created a copy.\n\n286\n00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:11.080\nSo Alt drag is a way that you\ncan do copying of a worksheet\n\n287\n00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.858\nall in one fell swoop.\n\n288\n00:15:12.858 --> 00:15:17.440\nAnd then I can just go ahead and\nsay cat2 here and so on and so forth.\n\n289\n00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.050\nSo that's fun.\n\n290\n00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:22.420\nAll of this was within one workbook, okay?\n\n291\n00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:26.605\nBut there's a lot of times where I\nmight have all of these worksheets and\n\n292\n00:15:26.605 --> 00:15:27.594\nI've got this.\n\n293\n00:15:27.594 --> 00:15:32.493\nAnd maybe Angie, I've done this a lot with\nAngie cuz I keep track of all my stuff and\n\n294\n00:15:32.493 --> 00:15:35.267\nthis and that,\nwhat I'm planning to do next.\n\n295\n00:15:35.267 --> 00:15:39.260\nAnd she's like, you have that,\ncan you just go ahead and send me that?\n\n296\n00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.725\nWell I don't wanna send the entire\nfile with all of my stuff.\n\n297\n00:15:42.725 --> 00:15:46.240\nI mean not that that would matter, but\nshe just doesn't need to see all of that.\n\n298\n00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:50.840\nI just need this one worksheet for her,\nbut I have to send it out as a file.\n\n299\n00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.942\nCuz I can't just send a sheet by itself,\n\n300\n00:15:53.942 --> 00:15:58.149\nit's got to be within a whole\nExcel file to transport.\n\n301\n00:15:58.149 --> 00:16:03.019\nSo what I do is I do the same thing,\nbut I move it into a new workbook\n\n302\n00:16:03.019 --> 00:16:08.269\nLet's just say that this is the July\nsales, maybe Angie needs this.\n\n303\n00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:11.330\nSo when I go to right click,\ngo to Move or Copy.\n\n304\n00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.400\nUp at the top where it says To Book,\nthis is within the same one.\n\n305\n00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.630\nI can just be like, you know what,\nlet's make a new one.\n\n306\n00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:22.810\nI don't want to remove it.\n\n307\n00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:24.780\nSo I'm gonna create a copy.\n\n308\n00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:30.240\nKeep it here in my manage worksheets file,\n\n309\n00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:34.590\nmake a new one, click OK,\nlook at where I'm at.\n\n310\n00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:38.230\nThis is book one with just\nthis worksheet in it.\n\n311\n00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:43.390\nI've copied this into a whole new book,\nthat's how you can\n\n312\n00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:48.160\njust send one sheet to a person,\nat least that's how I do it.\n\n313\n00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:54.490\n&gt;&gt; You seem to put odd emphasis on click\nthis check box, so my question is, is that\n\n314\n00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:58.630\nundoable if I accidentally move it without\nclicking that check box to create a copy?\n\n315\n00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:00.740\nCan I undo and move it back?\n\n316\n00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:01.240\n&gt;&gt; Well.\n\n317\n00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:04.350\nNo.\n\n318\n00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:05.880\n&gt;&gt; Not through undo.\n\n319\n00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:06.670\n&gt;&gt; I'm just looking.\n\n320\n00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:10.210\nNo, it doesn't really look like.\n\n321\n00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:11.750\nYou know, let's do this.\n\n322\n00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:12.980\nI'll show you a workaround.\n\n323\n00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:14.470\nSo I'm not going to save book one.\n\n324\n00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:15.390\nOkay.\nI'm going to come here,\n\n325\n00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:16.970\nI'm going to right click on here,\n\n326\n00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:19.940\nI'm going to move our copy,\nI'm not going to check that box off.\n\n327\n00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:20.570\nRight.\n\n328\n00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:22.730\nAnd we're just going to\ngo to a new workbook.\n\n329\n00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:26.850\nSo that means that there's July,\nif I flip back over to this,\n\n330\n00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:29.260\nJuly doesn't live here anymore, right?\n\n331\n00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:34.820\nSo could I go, that button, undo button,\nin the manage worksheets is gone.\n\n332\n00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.070\nIt's kind of like, you know,\nwhen you start working with the sheets,\n\n333\n00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:39.490\nyou're kind of committing to stuff.\n\n334\n00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:42.350\nBut on this one, but\nI already have it here.\n\n335\n00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:43.150\nOkay.\n\n336\n00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:46.280\nSo I could always just, oops,\nI forgot to make a copy.\n\n337\n00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.160\nSo then you do the same thing.\n\n338\n00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.720\nThis is a great example of, hey,\nI've got two workbooks open.\n\n339\n00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:57.850\nI've got book two and\nI've got managed worksheets.\n\n340\n00:17:57.850 --> 00:17:59.850\nSorry.\nI just went to my Finder.\n\n341\n00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:04.990\nWhat if I need to work between these\ntwo and move these back and forth?\n\n342\n00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:08.170\nThe whole right click and\nusing the move and copy totally fine,\n\n343\n00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:11.280\nbut if you have them open you can do this.\n\n344\n00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.841\nWhat if I wanted to\ntake this worksheet and\n\n345\n00:18:13.841 --> 00:18:19.290\nthis workbook, let me get my windows\nmoved around a little bit okay?\n\n346\n00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:25.430\nI wanna take this and move it, you can\njust click and drag all the way over,\n\n347\n00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:28.890\nand you actually just did the same\nthing I just did in the dialogue box.\n\n348\n00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:29.800\nJust dragging and dropping.\n\n349\n00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.982\nDo you remember what key we\nheld down to make a copy?\n\n350\n00:18:32.982 --> 00:18:34.080\n&gt;&gt; ALT + OPT.\n\n351\n00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:37.200\nyou knew where my mind was,\nyou saw it on my face.\n\n352\n00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.710\nSo I'm guessing ALT + OPT actually allows\nyou to do the same thing graphically,\n\n353\n00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:42.090\nbut you just make a copy now.\n\n354\n00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:42.770\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n355\n00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:44.430\nSo the one that I had moved,\n\n356\n00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:48.060\nhey I need sales of July back\nover into this workbook.\n\n357\n00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.120\nJust hold that alt key.\n\n358\n00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.250\nClick hold and drag and it's hard to see.\n\n359\n00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:54.200\nI can't zoom in while I'm\nholding these keys but\n\n360\n00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.910\nthere is a tiniest little plus sign.\n\n361\n00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:58.880\nIf I let go, do you see that\nlittle dot going there, Justin?\n\n362\n00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:02.160\nAs long you don't let go of the mouse and\n\n363\n00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:07.440\nthen keep the alt key held down, let go\nof the mouse, I've just made that copy.\n\n364\n00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.600\nSo alt drag between workbooks.\n\n365\n00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.270\nYou just have to have them open.\n\n366\n00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:15.350\nAnd the other thing is,\nif you wanted to bring them between\n\n367\n00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:18.880\nother files within this right click and\nmove and copy.\n\n368\n00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:19.910\nNotice this drop down.\n\n369\n00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:22.560\nIt's only only going to show\nwhat files you have open.\n\n370\n00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:23.280\nSo that's the thing.\n\n371\n00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.750\nTotally fine to use this way.\n\n372\n00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:28.380\nI'm just more of an Alt\ndrag type of person.\n\n373\n00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.900\nOpen them, move them around,\nand everything like that.\n\n374\n00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:32.150\nI like to do that.\nAnd you know what,\n\n375\n00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:34.610\nwe're gonna take this addresses and\nmove this back over here, so\n\n376\n00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:37.360\nI'm gonna alt option, drag that.\n\n377\n00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:40.870\nI'm going to close this Book two because\nI really, I really don't need it anymore,\n\n378\n00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:43.770\nthat was just for demonstration purposes.\n\n379\n00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:48.670\nAnd I will double click this title bar to,\noops come on, yeah you know,\n\n380\n00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:49.735\nokay there you go.\n\n381\n00:19:49.735 --> 00:19:52.632\n[LAUGH].\nSo go ahead and expand this back out.\n\n382\n00:19:52.632 --> 00:19:56.510\nSome other things to do,\nyou can hide worksheets,\n\n383\n00:19:56.510 --> 00:20:00.710\ntotally fun, this wouldn't something\nI would suggest if you are trying to\n\n384\n00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:04.860\nhide information from people, I will do\na little bit more security on that one.\n\n385\n00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:09.720\nBut if I right click you can hide and\nthen it's gone.\n\n386\n00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.770\nNow how would I know that was even hidden?\n\n387\n00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:14.520\nYou would just have to.\n\n388\n00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:15.950\nHow can I bring it back?\n\n389\n00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:21.920\nIf you right click on any tab and go to\nunhide, it will bring up a dialogue box,\n\n390\n00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:25.400\nthis little guy that shows you\nany of the hidden worksheets, and\n\n391\n00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.910\nthen you click OK and\nthen it brings it back.\n\n392\n00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:30.940\nUnlike hiding columns,\nremember when I had to select between them\n\n393\n00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:34.150\nto say like where are the ones that\nthey're hiding between to get them,\n\n394\n00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:36.280\nyou don't have to do\nthat with worksheet tabs.\n\n395\n00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:40.710\nSo totally fine if you wanted to do that.\n\n396\n00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:44.168\nAnd there's a couple,\nwhat's the other thing?\n\n397\n00:20:44.168 --> 00:20:49.580\nOn the Home tab of the ribbon,\nthere's some of the things\n\n398\n00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:55.170\ndown here in the Organize Sheets where you\nhave like rename, move or copy, tab color.\n\n399\n00:20:55.170 --> 00:21:00.670\nI actually had to look at my notes to even\nknow that this even lives in this ribbon,\n\n400\n00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:03.560\nbecause if I'm going to be formatting and\nmanaging my worksheets,\n\n401\n00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:07.680\nI'm going to be doing it right from\nthe worksheets themselves, okay.\n\n402\n00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.080\nDid I miss anything here?\n\n403\n00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.260\nNot really.\n\n404\n00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:11.660\nThere's a select.\n\n405\n00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:17.720\nSo Insert, much easier to just click\nthe button, Delete, Rename, Move or Copy.\n\n406\n00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:21.736\nWe're not gonna get in the View Code,\nyou don't do that.\n\n407\n00:21:21.736 --> 00:21:23.490\nFor text, that gets into another level so\n\n408\n00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:27.260\nthat's not necessary with anything we're\ngonna cover in this particular series.\n\n409\n00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:30.330\nAnd all right, cool, so\nI'll make sure I got everything.\n\n410\n00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.320\nSo that's managing your worksheets.\n\n411\n00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:38.530\nThe next thing I wanna show\nyou is more in the view.\n\n412\n00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:40.350\nAnd I put these two things together,\n\n413\n00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:43.630\nbecause it's just how you're\nmanaging what you're working with.\n\n414\n00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:45.380\nLet's come over here to Addresses,\n\n415\n00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.750\nthis is another one of my\nfavorites that show people.\n\n416\n00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:51.000\nLike really?\n\n417\n00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:51.980\nYeah.\n\n418\n00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.710\nFreeze panes, okay.\n\n419\n00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:55.820\nLove some freeze panes.\n\n420\n00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:56.920\nThis is a display thing.\n\n421\n00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:02.870\nThis is not a printing thing, or hiding of\nyour work columns, work columns [LAUGH]?\n\n422\n00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:04.830\nYour columns in your worksheet.\n\n423\n00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:07.260\nWhen I scroll down here, and\nI don't have a lot of information.\n\n424\n00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:12.110\nIf I scroll down, if I get to here,\nwas Trouble Paws,\n\n425\n00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:14.350\nwas Trouble their first name or\nis that the last name?\n\n426\n00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:18.230\nWas this the department or\nis this, well I don't remember.\n\n427\n00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:21.080\nSo you scroll back up,\nthat was the first name,\n\n428\n00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:23.190\nthat was the last name\nbecause you're calling it.\n\n429\n00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:24.640\nYou've had this before, right?\n\n430\n00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:25.760\nI can see Justin going like this.\n\n431\n00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.660\n&gt;&gt; So Von, the very first time\nI had to do this I was like,\n\n432\n00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:31.000\nI have like 1,000 rows and\nI just need these to like hang out.\n\n433\n00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:36.870\nI remember googling for like 25 minutes\non it cuz I didnt know how it was called.\n\n434\n00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:39.749\nI was like how do you make\nthe things with stuff stay.\n\n435\n00:22:39.749 --> 00:22:40.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I\n\n436\n00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:43.500\nwas like I don't know what to type in.\n\n437\n00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:47.710\nAnd well this becomes very handy cuz\nyou don't have a lot of data here but\n\n438\n00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:52.650\nthere are work sheets that have\nmind-blowing amounts of data.\n\n439\n00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:54.010\nJust a bunch of rows.\n\n440\n00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:57.940\nAnd really you're doing a kind\nof pass through, right?\n\n441\n00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:00.900\nI wanna keep the row headers or\nthe column headers, excuse me.\n\n442\n00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:02.630\n&gt;&gt; And yeah, I get this too.\n\n443\n00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:04.190\nHow do you even search for this.\n\n444\n00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:06.470\nIt's like,\nI don't even know what to call it.\n\n445\n00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:08.580\nWould you have called it freeze panes?\n\n446\n00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:10.540\nWhich is,\nhow do you freeze panes in Excel?\n\n447\n00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:11.820\nWould you have typed that in?\n\n448\n00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:12.605\n&gt;&gt; No, I didn't.\n\n449\n00:23:12.605 --> 00:23:14.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I happened upon a link,\n\n450\n00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:16.080\nthat took me to another link,\nthat took me to.\n\n451\n00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:18.010\nThen someone was like,\nthat's called freeze panes.\n\n452\n00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:20.370\nI was like how am I supposed to know that?\n\n453\n00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:23.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the terminology is always so\nmuch fun, so.\n\n454\n00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:25.780\nYeah, and this is gonna go this way,\n\n455\n00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:29.200\nbecause with my magic mouse I\nhad the fun horizontal scroll.\n\n456\n00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:33.840\nSo I wanna say, hey, I need to move\nover cuz I've got tons of columns.\n\n457\n00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.890\nI wanna keep the first and last name.\n\n458\n00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:38.200\nAnd I want the top.\n\n459\n00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.330\nThis is freezing.\n\n460\n00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:41.350\nLet's go through a few of them.\n\n461\n00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:44.680\nView, it's on your view\ntab of your ribbon.\n\n462\n00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.360\nThere's a couple of them right there.\n\n463\n00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.760\nThe Freeze top row, right?\n\n464\n00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.610\nI don't even have to be\nlike selected on anything.\n\n465\n00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:52.260\nI can be way out here.\n\n466\n00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:55.996\nIf I click on Freeze top row,\nthat's exactly what it does.\n\n467\n00:23:55.996 --> 00:24:01.934\nYou can see a freeze because\nthere's this gray line across it.\n\n468\n00:24:01.934 --> 00:24:06.918\nThat indicates to me visually that\nI have a frozen row right there,\n\n469\n00:24:06.918 --> 00:24:09.860\nand if I start scrolling, there it is.\n\n470\n00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:15.310\nI show people, they're like,\nmy gosh, that's what I needed.\n\n471\n00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:16.730\n&gt;&gt; It is a blissful feeling.\n\n472\n00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:20.440\nYou're like,\nI've been needing this for so long.\n\n473\n00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:23.380\nAnd I'm pretty sure\nolder versions of Excel,\n\n474\n00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:26.260\nthat used to be a little more hidden.\n\n475\n00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:29.790\nIt wasn't just a button where it was like,\nfreeze the top row.\n\n476\n00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:33.220\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yeah,\nthey did not have just this one option.\n\n477\n00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:36.480\nAnd by the way, if I wanna freeze\nsomething, I'd be be way down here.\n\n478\n00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:37.690\nSo it doesn't matter where you're at.\n\n479\n00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:41.500\nIf I click that button again,\nactually, no, sorry.\n\n480\n00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.210\nI got to unfreeze, sorry, [LAUGH] my bad.\n\n481\n00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:44.605\nYou click unfreeze.\n\n482\n00:24:44.605 --> 00:24:45.730\nOkay, so let's try that again.\n\n483\n00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:48.770\nI could be way down here,\nfreezes it, there you go.\n\n484\n00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:51.580\nIt took the bolding away,\nthat was interesting.\n\n485\n00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:52.460\nLet me unfreeze.\n\n486\n00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:56.730\nOkay, that was a little glitch.\n\n487\n00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:57.530\nDid you see that?\n\n488\n00:24:57.530 --> 00:25:01.110\n&gt;&gt; Actually, so unfreeze, go back,\nscroll down and freeze again.\n\n489\n00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:03.260\nSo scroll down and hit freeze there.\n\n490\n00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:06.850\nIt actually freezes\nthe top row in the view.\n\n491\n00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.955\n&gt;&gt; Which is not how I\nwould think about that.\n\n492\n00:25:10.955 --> 00:25:13.240\nBecause typically when you're\nworking with worksheets,\n\n493\n00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:16.450\nthe top row is your column headers.\n\n494\n00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:21.580\nAnd so when I think top row,\nI think the top row of the sheet.\n\n495\n00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:24.350\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna be completely\nhonest with you all\n\n496\n00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:25.480\n&gt;&gt; I didn't realize that either until\n\n497\n00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:26.005\njust now.\n\n498\n00:25:26.005 --> 00:25:29.955\n[LAUGH] I'm like you're right\nit is doing that, how strange.\n\n499\n00:25:29.955 --> 00:25:32.560\nBecause I would think top row is top row.\n\n500\n00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:36.220\nI also will tell you that I've never\nscrolled down into the middle of\n\n501\n00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:37.680\na worksheet and then clicked top row.\n\n502\n00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.640\nIf I want the top, I'm always here and\nthat's what I go ahead and click.\n\n503\n00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:43.790\nSo I don't think I've ever even\nnoticed that it's ever done that.\n\n504\n00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:48.112\nI'm glad you caught that,\nbecause I was going to be like, yeah, so\n\n505\n00:25:48.112 --> 00:25:50.540\nyou can be anywhere in your worksheet and\nyou can do it.\n\n506\n00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:51.210\nGuess what?\n\n507\n00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:52.910\nNo you can't,\nbecause that does make a difference.\n\n508\n00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:53.720\nBut that is kind of cool.\n\n509\n00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:56.710\nIf I wanted to be like, okay,\nI want to stop right here.\n\n510\n00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:59.040\nFreeze it and then, you know what?\n\n511\n00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.850\nI just realized I did something different.\n\n512\n00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:02.580\nOkay.\n\n513\n00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:03.640\nYou know what?\n\n514\n00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.900\nWe're going to clear this all up, people.\n\n515\n00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:06.470\nStay with me.\n\n516\n00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:08.780\nIf you're like, where did you go, Vonne?\n\n517\n00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:09.860\nIt's all right.\n\n518\n00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:13.076\nYou got your, [LAUGH] he put on\nhis backpack, like all right.\n\n519\n00:26:13.076 --> 00:26:14.935\nI'm ready.\n\n520\n00:26:14.935 --> 00:26:15.762\nOkay.\n\n521\n00:26:15.762 --> 00:26:19.100\nSo I would be a little careful about\nclicking these buttons just so\n\n522\n00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:19.730\nwilly nilly.\n\n523\n00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:23.100\nWhen I'm freezing the top row,\nI am in the top row.\n\n524\n00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:24.010\nThat's great.\n\n525\n00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:26.800\nIf I unfreeze panes, that's fine.\n\n526\n00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:31.360\nFreezing the first column, okay,\nthat looks like everything worked okay.\n\n527\n00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:34.830\nIt froze the first name because it I\nwanted to kind of be able to come over\n\n528\n00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:35.860\nhere and\n\n529\n00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:40.010\nlook at the team color, but now when I\nscroll this way it gets a little weird.\n\n530\n00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:44.990\nOkay so, those first and\ntop, I would definitely\n\n531\n00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:50.180\nmake sure that you are in the beginning of\nyour worksheet when you click on those.\n\n532\n00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:56.740\nBecause this is what happens when,\nhey, I wanna be able to scroll down.\n\n533\n00:26:56.740 --> 00:27:01.850\nAnd I also wanna scroll this way but\nI want it to freeze the first and last.\n\n534\n00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:03.760\nAnd I want it to freeze the top.\n\n535\n00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:07.480\nLook at what cell I'm selected on.\n\n536\n00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:12.420\nI'm selected on C2, meaning anything\nto the top of where I'm at,\n\n537\n00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:21.220\nand anything to the left of where I'm at\nright now, becomes my freeze quadrant.\n\n538\n00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:25.970\nSo when I'm here, and\nthen I click this freeze panes.\n\n539\n00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:29.420\nNot the top, not the first, freeze panes.\n\n540\n00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:32.150\nDo you see how it creates.\n\n541\n00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:37.110\nI can scroll this way, and\nI can also scroll this way.\n\n542\n00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:41.830\nSo that's where it becomes my freeze mark.\n\n543\n00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:45.420\nAnd that's where I can go ahead and\nsay, this is where I want to freeze.\n\n544\n00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:47.700\nAnd I think what's happening is\nwhen we're scrolling down and\n\n545\n00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:51.170\nwe're clicking those buttons, it's kind\nof like, I don't know where the top and,\n\n546\n00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:53.960\nokay, I'm just gonna go ahead and\nfreeze right there.\n\n547\n00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:55.880\nI think that's what's happening.\n\n548\n00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.460\nI'm gonna go with it.\n\n549\n00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:00.710\nBe careful about where you're\nat when you begin to freeze.\n\n550\n00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:04.180\nWhen I'm down into here and\nI click Unfreeze.\n\n551\n00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:07.220\nYou see and then it takes them all away.\n\n552\n00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:09.523\nBut you can get yourself a little\nout of whack if you're like,\n\n553\n00:28:09.523 --> 00:28:11.000\nI don't know what I just did.\n\n554\n00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.770\nSo just be careful.\n\n555\n00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:14.430\nUnfreeze it, takes everything off.\n\n556\n00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:16.930\nAnd then make sure it's\nwhere your cursor is.\n\n557\n00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:22.150\nThat does give an indication of\nwhere you're going to be freezing.\n\n558\n00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:27.880\n&gt;&gt; And I think for the top and\nthe column, that pivot point that\n\n559\n00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:32.110\nshe was talking about, that road column\nof where we're going to rope off things.\n\n560\n00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:34.305\nThat's indicated by the little\ngray dot in that icon.\n\n561\n00:28:34.305 --> 00:28:36.710\nSo that is a helpful reminder.\n\n562\n00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:39.460\nHowever, I would not anticipate that\n\n563\n00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:44.010\nwhatever is in the view being the freeze\nfor the column and the top row.\n\n564\n00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:46.535\nThat would have not been\nexpected behavior for me.\n\n565\n00:28:46.535 --> 00:28:48.050\nAnd I'd have been like, what is this?\n\n566\n00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:50.960\nI can see the utility of that, right?\n\n567\n00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.270\nI wanna compare this record\nagainst all the other records,\n\n568\n00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:55.810\nnot necessarily the row headings.\n\n569\n00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:59.580\nIt just,\nit's not a use case that I've used a lot.\n\n570\n00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:01.420\n&gt;&gt; This is the first I've\never done it too, okay?\n\n571\n00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:04.520\nBecause I just tried it,\nI don't know if you noticed.\n\n572\n00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.080\nI put my mouse over here.\n\n573\n00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:09.420\nPhone number is now the first column, and\n\n574\n00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:13.470\nthen the freeze is now happening there,\nokay?\n\n575\n00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:17.800\nThis is something I just learned too,\nso [LAUGH].\n\n576\n00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:20.770\n&gt;&gt; What was odd about that is\nwhen you froze that column,\n\n577\n00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:23.030\nyou can't actually look\nat anything to the left.\n\n578\n00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:24.090\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, I know.\n\n579\n00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:26.010\nIt's like that doesn't exist anymore.\n\n580\n00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:28.210\nSo it's like a deep freeze, [LAUGH].\n\n581\n00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:32.570\nThought it was pretty interesting,\nso hey, you learned.\n\n582\n00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:34.700\nWe're all learning together, look at that.\n\n583\n00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:35.840\nHow long have I been doing this?\n\n584\n00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.620\nSee, I do the same thing.\n\n585\n00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:40.188\nI come up and, I didn't know I did that.\n\n586\n00:29:40.188 --> 00:29:42.550\n[LAUGH] Very cool.\n\n587\n00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:45.970\nThe one that does kinda mess me up is,\nokay, so the freeze.\n\n588\n00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:49.670\nBy the way, and you said the older\nversions because it was in the view menu.\n\n589\n00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:51.100\nWith the view menu and the freeze panes,\n\n590\n00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:53.780\nand that did have to like,\nyou'd need to make sure your cursor.\n\n591\n00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:58.530\nYou'd have to like select the first\nrow to freeze it and then freeze, so\n\n592\n00:29:58.530 --> 00:29:59.840\ndo be careful of that.\n\n593\n00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:05.240\nSplit, I'm gonna tell you,\nsplits get me all split.\n\n594\n00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:06.540\nI don't like them.\n\n595\n00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:09.264\nWhen I click on it, so if, well,\nlook at where my cursor is.\n\n596\n00:30:09.264 --> 00:30:14.570\nIf I click on split,\nit splits my screen into four quadrants.\n\n597\n00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:21.050\nAnd then I can scroll separately\nin each quadrant to kinda get\n\n598\n00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:26.530\nme to where I can scroll this one\nover here, this one over here.\n\n599\n00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:30.820\nIt's great for you to be able to compare\nand contrast areas of your worksheet.\n\n600\n00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:36.980\nI personally just don't like that\nbecause it gets me kind of confused as\n\n601\n00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:37.555\nto where I'm at.\n\n602\n00:30:37.555 --> 00:30:42.800\nYou can also drag the split so\nthat way you can change this.\n\n603\n00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:46.788\nIt's kind of, it's better for when\nyou're like wanting to compare things.\n\n604\n00:30:46.788 --> 00:30:49.830\nBut it just gets me too twisted, and\nI don't know where I'm at anymore.\n\n605\n00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:53.560\nSo I have to stop splitting, so\nthen I just take the split off, and\n\n606\n00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.090\nthen everything kind of\ngoes back to everything.\n\n607\n00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:58.010\nJust something to look at.\n\n608\n00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:00.860\nThe other thing, of course,\nis I can take this workbook and\n\n609\n00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:03.110\nsplit it into two windows.\n\n610\n00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:05.160\nAnother reason for\ncomparing and contrasting.\n\n611\n00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.100\nIf I go to window, and\n\n612\n00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:12.790\nI go to new, notice that I have\na worksheet, manned worksheets two.\n\n613\n00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:14.345\nSo, I can put these next to each other.\n\n614\n00:31:14.345 --> 00:31:19.290\nBecause maybe I need to\nlook at the Fuego worksheet\n\n615\n00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:24.040\nagainst the Cap Two worksheet, and\nthen we go ahead and move around.\n\n616\n00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:30.260\nBut do notice that if I take this and\nI start typing, in sheet three here.\n\n617\n00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:31.890\nThis is Fuego.\n\n618\n00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:36.170\nAnd then look over here,\nyou're basically just mirroring.\n\n619\n00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:41.580\nYou're not creating two separate files,\nit's just a mirror of the same file.\n\n620\n00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:46.670\nSo when I close this number two\nfile it's not gonna warn me for\n\n621\n00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:50.020\nchanges because it's not a separate file,\nokay?\n\n622\n00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:52.670\nIt's just another view.\n\n623\n00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:55.520\nAnd once you have that other window,\nyou can do your ranges,\n\n624\n00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:58.110\nthings that we've covered in\nsome of the other episodes.\n\n625\n00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:02.820\nSo just ways to, well, manage your\nworksheets, manage your workbooks, and\n\n626\n00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:04.560\nhow you can look at things.\n\n627\n00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:05.960\nYou can analyze things.\n\n628\n00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:06.950\nYou can rename things.\n\n629\n00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:11.630\nYou can color code things and\nhave a lot of fun with your files.\n\n630\n00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:15.410\n&gt;&gt; Well Vonne, you've definitely shown us\na little bit of aesthetically pleasing\n\n631\n00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:17.070\nthings that we can do.\n\n632\n00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:19.810\nBut don't forget that they\ndo have utility, right?\n\n633\n00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:24.440\nIf your company has everything red,\nthat's tagged red is for accounting,\n\n634\n00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:26.550\neverything purple is for logistics.\n\n635\n00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:30.090\nEverything yellow is, well, unseen, then\n\n636\n00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:35.520\nyou can use that to get a quick glance\norganizational kind of palette, right?\n\n637\n00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:38.380\nWell you also saw that not\neverything is rainbows and unicorns,\n\n638\n00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:39.900\nand that's perfectly okay.\n\n639\n00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:40.860\nBut speaking of rainbows and\n\n640\n00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:43.760\nunicorns, we've gotta go do the end\nof the rainbow to find a unicorn.\n\n641\n00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.360\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n642\n00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:48.170\nSo signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n643\n00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:49.040\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n644\n00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:49.865\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n645\n00:32:49.865 -->
