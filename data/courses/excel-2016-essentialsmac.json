00:00:14.046\nI'm your show host Vonn Smith and\nin this course overview,\n\n4\n00:00:14.046 --> 00:00:18.030\nwe're going to be talking about what\nexactly is covered in this series.\n\n5\n00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.290\nWho is our target audience?\n\n6\n00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.930\nDo we need to know anything\nbefore we get started and\n\n7\n00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.890\nany extra tidbits I have for you.\n\n8\n00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.210\nAs you can see,\n\n9\n00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.590\nthere's only two main topics that\nwe have in this particular series.\n\n10\n00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.605\nWe have the introduction and\nformat work books.\n\n11\n00:00:30.605 --> 00:00:33.740\nBut there is quite few things that\nwe talk about in each one of those.\n\n12\n00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.040\nIn the introduction we start from\nthe very beginning of like, what's Excel?\n\n13\n00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.250\nWhat's the history of Excel?\n\n14\n00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.272\nWhat's the file format?\n\n15\n00:00:39.272 --> 00:00:44.410\nThen we get into some other basics\nwithin the Mac operating system.\n\n16\n00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.400\nWe're still using Windows, and what is the\napplication window versus the worksheet\n\n17\n00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.400\nwindow and how to navigate around that.\n\n18\n00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.040\nAnd the interface of Excel, what is the\nribbon, where is the quick access toolbar,\n\n19\n00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.160\nwhere is the status bar,\nhow do I get to the zooms and everything.\n\n20\n00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.200\nSo that's all within those\nparticular episodes.\n\n21\n00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.610\nThen we're gonna get into\nnavigating a workbook.\n\n22\n00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.630\nHow do I get around?\n\n23\n00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.890\nWhat's the name box?\n\n24\n00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.280\nHow can I use that to\nget to particular cells?\n\n25\n00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.300\nUsing the keyboard to help us get around\nto be a little more efficient and\n\n26\n00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.060\nproductive with getting around\na particular workbook and worksheets.\n\n27\n00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.290\nAnd the all important,\nhow do I select things?\n\n28\n00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.840\nWe're gonna spend quite a bit of time\n\n29\n00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.480\nwithin that particular episode about\ndifferent ways that we can do that, again,\n\n30\n00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.265\nwith keyboard shortcuts,\nhow to use your mouse to select to effect.\n\n31\n00:01:34.265 --> 00:01:39.275\nCuz you've gotta make sure you know where\nto select before you can do anything.\n\n32\n00:01:39.275 --> 00:01:42.460\nThen we're gonna get into actually\ninserting data into our cells.\n\n33\n00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.790\nHow do I type values in?\n\n34\n00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.410\nHow do I edit them?\n\n35\n00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.930\nWe'll also be covering fill series,\nwhich is really fun, and\n\n36\n00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.210\ndifferent ways that we can go ahead and\n\n37\n00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.290\nquickly get in things like the days of\nthe week and the months of the year.\n\n38\n00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.290\nWe also have an episode on cut,\ncopy, paste.\n\n39\n00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.720\nYes, an entire episode on it.\n\n40\n00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.040\nYou're thinking, hm, really?\n\n41\n00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.960\nWell, in Excel,\nit can get a little tricky.\n\n42\n00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.150\nAnd there's some little gotchas in there\nthat you need to be aware of so that way\n\n43\n00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:14.550\nyou can understand what it's doing when\nyou copy something and paste something.\n\n44\n00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.100\nEspecially when you get into your rows and\ncolumns.\n\n45\n00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.150\nAnd then we'll talk about file formats and\nhow to export, which\n\n46\n00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.820\nis really to just save as, and really\ntalk about the CSV file format at length.\n\n47\n00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.700\nThen we get into how do I format\nthings within a workbook?\n\n48\n00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.920\nStarting with modifying\nthe structure of your worksheets.\n\n49\n00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.830\nHow do I add or delete columns or rows?\n\n50\n00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.180\nHow do I change the widths of columns and\nrows?\n\n51\n00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.380\nWe'll also get in to how to merge cells.\n\n52\n00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.270\nThen we'll move on to formatting.\n\n53\n00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.440\nWe'll be formatting our cells with font,\ncolor, size.\n\n54\n00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.400\nWe'll also do a little bit more with\nhorizontal and vertical alignment.\n\n55\n00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.130\nWe'll also talk about styles.\n\n56\n00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.760\nI love styles and how they can\nbe really handy and helpful for\n\n57\n00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.205\nformatting your data within\nyour worksheets and workbooks.\n\n58\n00:03:03.205 --> 00:03:06.280\nThen we get into the all\nimportant number formats, okay?\n\n59\n00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.290\nA big deal within Excel.\n\n60\n00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.130\nA very important concept and\ntopic to understand,\n\n61\n00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.590\nso we have some good information there.\n\n62\n00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.125\nThen we go into page layout for printing.\n\n63\n00:03:16.125 --> 00:03:19.525\nNow, yes, this is a spreadsheet\napplication, but you are normally or\n\n64\n00:03:19.525 --> 00:03:23.284\nmost likely going to be printing, so\nwe need to know those different options.\n\n65\n00:03:23.284 --> 00:03:27.338\nWe'll get into page breaks and\nhow do I do shrinking and\n\n66\n00:03:27.338 --> 00:03:31.584\nhow do I fit things on pages\nthat you want to have printed.\n\n67\n00:03:31.584 --> 00:03:35.962\nAnd we'll also talk about\nmanaging our workbooks, meaning,\n\n68\n00:03:35.962 --> 00:03:38.115\nhow do I rename my worksheets?\n\n69\n00:03:38.115 --> 00:03:42.150\nHow do I change the tab colors and\norganizing them?\n\n70\n00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.780\nSo who is this for?\n\n71\n00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.000\nThis is for all Office users,\nwith a capital O,\n\n72\n00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.040\nmeaning you're using Office 365 or\na locally installed version of Excel.\n\n73\n00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.070\nAnd this would be starting at the basics,\n\n74\n00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.900\nI mean, we'll start from\nthe very beginning and move up.\n\n75\n00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.325\nSo I would say this would be for\nanybody that has some basic skills and\n\n76\n00:04:01.325 --> 00:04:05.470\nwant to move up into the intermediate\nlevel of knowing Excel.\n\n77\n00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.220\nI would say that would\nbe the target audience.\n\n78\n00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.400\nDo you need to know anything?\n\n79\n00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.680\nYou need to know a little a bit about\nhow the Mac operating system works.\n\n80\n00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.690\nSo it's a general understanding of like\nwhere is the Finder and to open and\n\n81\n00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.750\nclose files.\n\n82\n00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.430\nWe do cover that on our episodes as well.\n\n83\n00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.158\nYou don't need anything\nof Excel to get started.\n\n84\n00:04:23.158 --> 00:04:24.910\nMaybe you've used it a little bit and\n\n85\n00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.470\nwant like a refresher course or\njust different ways of doing things.\n\n86\n00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.510\nThis is a great series to start with that.\n\n87\n00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.780\nAnd maybe familiarity with other\nOffice products could be helpful.\n\n88\n00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.680\nNot imperative.\n\n89\n00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.830\nJust you wanna start somewhere\nfrom the beginning in Excel,\n\n90\n00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.470\nthis is the series for you.\n\n91\n00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.910\nThere's always other options of how to do\nthings in all of your Office programs,\n\n92\n00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.750\nExcel included.\n\n93\n00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.508\nEverybody has a different reason why they\nwant to use Excel and how they use Excel.\n\n94\n00:04:54.508 --> 00:04:59.150\nSo, I am trying to show you from just\na practical standpoint of how to use\n\n95\n00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.415\nthis particular product.\n\n96\n00:05:01.415 --> 00:05:04.567\nSo, just do be aware that everybody\nhas different reasons for\n\n97\n00:05:04.567 --> 00:05:07.610\nusing them and that kinda ties\ninto the different options.\n\n98\n00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.510\nUpdates do happen, yes.\n\n99\n00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.740\nBecause this is an Office 366 product,\nthere is going to be updates.\n\n100\n00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.950\nSo, at the time of this recording,\nI have a particular version.\n\n101\n00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.120\nWhen you're watching it, there might\nhave been some more updates, and so\n\n102\n00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.190\nthings might be a little bit different.\n\n103\n00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.220\nSo definitely check\nabout your versions and\n\n104\n00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.270\nwhere to find what version\nof Excel you are working in.\n\n105\n00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.260\nWe talk about that in the introduction\nepisode within this course.\n\n106\n00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.680\nSo just be aware of it.\n\n107\n00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.120\nAnd, of course, there's tons of\ninformation about Excel online through\n\n108\n00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.770\nthe different Microsoft help files and\nother websites.\n\n109\n00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.150\nSo definitely use the Internet to\nyour advantage to search for answers.\n\n110\n00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.170\nAnd of course, have some fun.\n\n111\n00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.630\nExcel can be frustrating\nfrom time to time.\n\n112\n00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.490\nI can understand, I have been there.\n\n113\n00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.857\nBut hopefully going\nthrough these episodes,\n\n114\n00:05:55.857 --> 00:05:58.350\nyou'll have a better understanding of it.\n\n115\n00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.700\nAnd I like to have fun,\nI hope you have fun and\n\n116\n00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.061\nI hope you learn a lot and\nI will see you soon.\n\n117\n00:06:05.061 --> 00:06:10.058\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
