on\n\n3\n00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:14.520\nMicrosoft Excel 2016.\n\n4\n00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.110\nI'm here with Mike Roderick\nwho's gonna help us\n\n5\n00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.070\nunderstand what we'll be\nlearning in this series.\n\n6\n00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.160\nMike Yeah,\nwe're gonna be covering Excel from top\n\n7\n00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.780\nto bottom really from a couple\ndifferent perspectives.\n\n8\n00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.990\nThese videos that we're getting ready\nto shoot are gonna help those of you\n\n9\n00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.030\nthat are getting started in Excel.\n\n10\n00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.760\nMaybe you've gotten a new job and\n\n11\n00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.140\nyou need to learn how to use Excel because\nit's part of your job requirements.\n\n12\n00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.340\nWe're also gonna be covering a lot\nof the objectives that are for\n\n13\n00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.550\nthe Microsoft exam.\n\n14\n00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.340\nYou can go out and get certified in Excel\nto prove your knowledge to your employer.\n\n15\n00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.740\nSo we're gonna hit it from both angles\nthere, trying to cover everybody's needs.\n\n16\n00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.920\nAnd we're gonna cover,\n\n17\n00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.690\nthese are basically the first series\nof videos that we're gonna do.\n\n18\n00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.070\nWe're gonna start with the basics,\nwe're gonna learn how to simply create\n\n19\n00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.270\nworksheets and workbooks and\nnavigate around that user interface so\n\n20\n00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.070\nthat I feel comfortable\nWorking with Excel.\n\n21\n00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.010\nWe're gonna look at inserting\nthings like hyperlinks and\n\n22\n00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.330\nchanging worksheet order and\ncoloring tabs.\n\n23\n00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.170\nWe'll move on then from that\nto formatting our worksheets.\n\n24\n00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.430\nOnce I've got that data inserted into a\nworksheet, I've gotta make it presentable\n\n25\n00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.800\nso I can turn in back in to my\nsuperiors or take it to a meeting.\n\n26\n00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.490\nHow do I make it look good, right?\n\n27\n00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.860\nHow do I get my columns lined up right?\n\n28\n00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.770\nHow do I get the text, the right font and\nunderlined, or what have you.\n\n29\n00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.210\nWe're gonna cover all of that.\n\n30\n00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.040\nWe're gonna look at things like\ndata validation to make sure that\n\n31\n00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.570\nwhen data is entered into this worksheet,\nthat it's in the correct format.\n\n32\n00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.590\nWe're gonna take a look at different\noptions and views that we can configure.\n\n33\n00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.630\nHiding worksheets,\nhiding columns and rows,\n\n34\n00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.930\nwe're gonna take a brief look at macros,\nrecording some simple macros that allow me\n\n35\n00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.750\nto automate some of my routine tasks\nthat I have to do and then we're gonna\n\n36\n00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.130\ntake a look at how we can print workbooks\nand how we cans ave those workbooks and\n\n37\n00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.530\nmake sure that they're available for\nother people to access.\n\n38\n00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.670\nOr if I need a hard copy,\n\n39\n00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.910\nhow do I print just this one\nworksheet out of this workbook?\n\n40\n00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.190\nOr how do I print a specific\narea of a worksheet?\n\n41\n00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.760\nAnd then we're gonna dive\ninto formatting cells, right?\n\n42\n00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.350\nMaking sure that currency is formatted\nwith a dollar sign and decimal points and\n\n43\n00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.680\nthat dates show up properly.\n\n44\n00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.970\nWe'll take a look at creating groups and\noutlines to summarize our data and\n\n45\n00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.970\ngive us that summary\ninformation that we need.\n\n46\n00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.722\nWe also take a look at things like\nsparklines and charts and inserting\n\n47\n00:02:38.722 --> 00:02:44.375\nsmart art and other objects that gives me\nthe visual representation for the data.\n\n48\n00:02:44.375 --> 00:02:48.795\nThey give me another way to look at it\nthat make it possible to spot trends and\n\n49\n00:02:48.795 --> 00:02:50.695\nanomalies in my data.\n\n50\n00:02:50.695 --> 00:02:53.525\nAlso taking a look at tables, right?\n\n51\n00:02:53.525 --> 00:02:58.455\nTables are a great part of Excel,\na great way to organize my data,\n\n52\n00:02:58.455 --> 00:03:01.375\nfilter my data, sort my data.\n\n53\n00:03:01.375 --> 00:03:04.065\nAnd then we take a look at functions,\nof course.\n\n54\n00:03:04.065 --> 00:03:06.835\nBecause that's gonna be a big\npart of working with Excel.\n\n55\n00:03:06.835 --> 00:03:09.340\nWe can put these raw numbers in there, but\n\n56\n00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.480\nI need to be able to figure out sums and\naverages and counts.\n\n57\n00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.960\nWe're gonna cover all that for you.\n\n58\n00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.677\nSo, if you are in a position where you\nneed to use Excel as part of your everyday\n\n59\n00:03:19.677 --> 00:03:24.468\njob or if you're studying up to take one\nof those Microsoft specialist exams,\n\n60\n00:03:24.468 --> 00:03:26.806\nthese are gonna be the videos for you.\n\n61\n00:03:26.806 -->

00:00:17.134\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n4\n00:00:17.134 --> 00:00:20.976\nAnd today, we're gonna be talking\nabout working with Excel 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:20.976 --> 00:00:23.389\nNow, when we talk about\nworking with Excel 2016,\n\n6\n00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:26.746\na lot of times this is one of the main\nbusiness applications that we tend to see\n\n7\n00:00:26.746 --> 00:00:28.790\njust about on every single computer.\n\n8\n00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.855\nBecause it actually is so\ndiverse, there's so\n\n9\n00:00:30.855 --> 00:00:32.669\nmany different things you can do with it.\n\n10\n00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.080\nAnd to help us out is\ngonna be Mr Mike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.349\nMike let's say for example,\n\n12\n00:00:36.349 --> 00:00:39.304\nthat what we have is that we have\na new business that we're starting.\n\n13\n00:00:39.304 --> 00:00:42.960\nAnd one of the main applications that we\nwanna use to help keep track of everything\n\n14\n00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.930\nis gonna be something like Excel.\n\n15\n00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.060\nSo Mike, where's the best place that\nwe can get started if we really aren't\n\n16\n00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.230\nfamiliar with Excel?\n\n17\n00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.355\n>> That's a great question Ronnie and\nit's a very good scenario.\n\n18\n00:00:52.355 --> 00:00:55.340\nThat's a very typical thing to see,\nespecially in your smaller businesses.\n\n19\n00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.738\nAnd again, even in your big businesses,\n\n20\n00:00:57.738 --> 00:01:00.760\nExcel is an application\nthat gets used constantly.\n\n21\n00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.890\nCuz it is so powerful, and it is so\ngood at crunching numbers and\n\n22\n00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.196\nkeeping track of things.\n\n23\n00:01:05.196 --> 00:01:08.143\nIt's just under a data.\n\n24\n00:01:08.143 --> 00:01:10.999\nIt's not a relational database engine,\nit's not a database.\n\n25\n00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:14.575\nBut it sure does come close with some\nof the cool techniques we can do.\n\n26\n00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:17.152\nAnd we're gonna explore all of\nthose throughout these episodes.\n\n27\n00:01:17.152 --> 00:01:21.267\nBut if we're just getting started, then\nthe first thing we need to make sure we do\n\n28\n00:01:21.267 --> 00:01:23.759\nis we can launch the application and\nget around.\n\n29\n00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.857\nGet our feet wet, kinda dive in\nexplore the application itself.\n\n30\n00:01:27.857 --> 00:01:31.898\nIt's something that I always recommend to\npeople when you first get an application\n\n31\n00:01:31.898 --> 00:01:34.392\nor you're first getting\nexposed to some program.\n\n32\n00:01:34.392 --> 00:01:36.272\nJust go in there and\nclick around for a little bit.\n\n33\n00:01:36.272 --> 00:01:39.570\nJust look around,\nsee what things you have and explore.\n\n34\n00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.333\nSo, that's what we're gonna do\nin this particular episode.\n\n35\n00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:46.410\nSo on my computer here,\nI've got Excel 2016 installed.\n\n36\n00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.915\nAnd first thing we're gonna do is\nsee how we can launch Excel, and\n\n37\n00:01:49.915 --> 00:01:51.839\na few different ways we can do that.\n\n38\n00:01:51.839 --> 00:01:55.072\nI'm running Windows 10 as my operating\nsystem, and when I look here,\n\n39\n00:01:55.072 --> 00:01:56.297\nI'm old school, Ronnie.\n\n40\n00:01:56.297 --> 00:01:59.838\nI like desktop icons, but\nI've got nothing out here.\n\n41\n00:01:59.838 --> 00:02:01.649\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I like task bar icons,\n\n42\n00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.632\nI don't have anything for\nExcel down there.\n\n43\n00:02:04.632 --> 00:02:11.074\nAnd with Windows 10, we've got this new\nfancy Start menu going on over here.\n\n44\n00:02:11.074 --> 00:02:12.838\nAnd I don't see Excel there either.\n\n45\n00:02:12.838 --> 00:02:14.643\nSo it almost doesn't look like, or\n\n46\n00:02:14.643 --> 00:02:18.080\nit almost looks like I don't\nhave Excel installed at all.\n\n47\n00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.740\nBut I do.\n\n48\n00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.609\nSo, let's go find it.\n\n49\n00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:24.960\nSo, we're going to go to our Start menu,\nand we're going to click on All Apps.\n\n50\n00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.137\nAnd then, we're going to\nscroll through and find Excel.\n\n51\n00:02:28.137 --> 00:02:30.481\nAnd this would work, again, for\nany of your Office applications.\n\n52\n00:02:30.481 --> 00:02:33.420\nNone of them showed up\nwhen I installed Office.\n\n53\n00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.554\nSo, we wanna make them easily accessible.\n\n54\n00:02:35.554 --> 00:02:39.729\nEasiest way to do that, I think, is just\nto either pin it to your Start menu,\n\n55\n00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:43.610\npin it to your taskbar or\ncreate a shortcut on your desktop.\n\n56\n00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:44.240\nSo, let's do that.\n\n57\n00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.067\nI'm gonna right-click on that,\nand you'll see my options here.\n\n58\n00:02:47.067 --> 00:02:48.332\nPin to Start.\n\n59\n00:02:48.332 --> 00:02:54.980\nIf I choose that, well, now I have a new\ntile on my Start screen, Start menu.\n\n60\n00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.382\nAnd now I can move that around,\nI can put it wherever I want so\n\n61\n00:02:58.382 --> 00:03:00.300\nit's easily accessible.\n\n62\n00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.230\nSo now, anytime I wanna launch Excel,\nI go to my Start menu, and there it is.\n\n63\n00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.603\nThe other way we can do it would\nbe to pin it to our taskbar.\n\n64\n00:03:08.603 --> 00:03:11.355\nNow, I'm gonna go back to All Apps.\n\n65\n00:03:11.355 --> 00:03:16.450\nI'm gonna right-click on Excel again,\nand choose Pin to Taskbar.\n\n66\n00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.736\nAnd now I've got that familiar\nicon right there on my taskbar,\n\n67\n00:03:19.736 --> 00:03:23.964\none of my favorite ways to launch the\napplication because that's always there.\n\n68\n00:03:23.964 --> 00:03:27.931\nEven if I have another window\nmaximized taking up my desktop,\n\n69\n00:03:27.931 --> 00:03:30.384\nit's right there within easy reach.\n\n70\n00:03:30.384 --> 00:03:35.062\nAnd I can right-click on that and\nI'll get this, what we call jump list,\n\n71\n00:03:35.062 --> 00:03:40.440\nwhere I can see all my recently opened\nfiles, and I love that feature.\n\n72\n00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.531\nAll right.\n\n73\n00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:44.086\nAnother way we could do it would be\nto put a shortcut on the desktop.\n\n74\n00:03:44.086 --> 00:03:46.340\nA lot of people love those shortcuts.\n\n75\n00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.350\nI've seen people, Ronnie,\nthat have dozens and more shortcuts,\n\n76\n00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.380\nwhere there's no more room on the desktop,\nthey've got so many shortcuts.\n\n77\n00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.736\nIf you're one of those, they don't\nmake it as easy as they used to.\n\n78\n00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:59.280\nIt's still not difficult,\nyou just have to know the trick.\n\n79\n00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.570\nI'm gonna go to my, again,\nAll Applications of my Start menu.\n\n80\n00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.630\nFind Excel, right-click on it.\n\n81\n00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.186\nBut there is no create shortcut or\nsend to desktop option here.\n\n82\n00:04:09.186 --> 00:04:11.589\nBut what I can do is open file location.\n\n83\n00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.040\nThat's gonna open up File Explorer and\n\n84\n00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.290\nthere's a shortcut to\nthe program Excel 2016.\n\n85\n00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:25.582\nI can right-click on that, and\nchoose Send to Desktop, create shortcut.\n\n86\n00:04:25.582 --> 00:04:28.000\nNow, when I close File Explorer,\n\n87\n00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.790\nthere's my handy dandy little\nshortcut right there at my desktop.\n\n88\n00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.060\nSo, now that I've got the program\ninstalled, and we've got our icons out\n\n89\n00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.540\nhere, we can get to the program anytime we\nwant, whatever your favorite method is.\n\n90\n00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.510\nIf you preferred the taskbar,\nhit it down there.\n\n91\n00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.787\nIf you want an icon on your desktop,\ngo open the file location and\n\n92\n00:04:44.787 --> 00:04:46.008\nsend it to the desktop.\n\n93\n00:04:46.008 --> 00:04:48.249\nAnd now,\nyou've got an icon on your desktop.\n\n94\n00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:51.830\nIf you like that new fancy Start menu\nwith the tiles, well, there it is,\n\n95\n00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:52.930\npin it to that.\n\n96\n00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.210\nOr, as I did, pin it to all three.\n\n97\n00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.394\nYou can see you don't have\nto choose one or the other.\n\n98\n00:04:56.394 --> 00:05:00.430\nYou can do all three, and that way\nanywhere you go it's easy to find Excel.\n\n99\n00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.771\nAnd, of course, we shouldn't forget\nwe can also type in here Excel, and\n\n100\n00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:06.534\nit will find it, hopefully.\n\n101\n00:05:06.534 --> 00:05:09.146\nYou know how Cortana is sometimes,\nno, just teasing.\n\n102\n00:05:09.146 --> 00:05:11.355\nCortana will go find it for you and\nshe'll put it up there, and\n\n103\n00:05:11.355 --> 00:05:12.384\nyou can click on it that way.\n\n104\n00:05:12.384 --> 00:05:18.000\nSo, several different ways we can set it\nup to get in to our favorite application.\n\n105\n00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.910\n>> You know, a lot of times it's\nhard to actually realize this.\n\n106\n00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.080\nIf you grew up in the days in which,\nyou know,\n\n107\n00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.215\nall of the applications showed up in that\nsingle Start menu, you're used to do that.\n\n108\n00:05:27.215 --> 00:05:30.935\nBut with the newer, you know,\noperating systems like Windows 10,\n\n109\n00:05:30.935 --> 00:05:32.520\nnothing shows up right away.\n\n110\n00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.630\nAnd a lot of it's actually\nhidden inside of there,\n\n111\n00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.920\nbecause they expect you\nshould be working with it.\n\n112\n00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.932\nBut if you're like most of us, and\nwe grew up with another operating system.\n\n113\n00:05:39.932 --> 00:05:42.700\nWe want things to appear fairly familiar.\n\n114\n00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.396\nAnd putting things on your desktop is one\nof the most familiar ways that we can\n\n115\n00:05:46.396 --> 00:05:49.127\nlaunch an application without\nhaving to search for it.\n\n116\n00:05:49.127 --> 00:05:50.925\nAnd that's the whole goal\nbehind these applications.\n\n117\n00:05:50.925 --> 00:05:54.409\nNot so that you go, oh, I don't know if\nI'm gonna decide between my taskbar and\n\n118\n00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.990\nmy desktop.\n\n119\n00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.228\nBut it's to make it easier, so\nthat you can launch into that application.\n\n120\n00:05:58.228 --> 00:06:00.376\nAnd then, once you get into\nthe application of course,\n\n121\n00:06:00.376 --> 00:06:03.452\nis now you can do the things that Mike\nwas talking about, which is exploration.\n\n122\n00:06:03.452 --> 00:06:04.032\n>> Absolutely.\n\n123\n00:06:04.032 --> 00:06:07.491\nAnd it's a great point\nwhatever works best for you.\n\n124\n00:06:07.491 --> 00:06:09.849\nI have very few applications down here.\n\n125\n00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:14.364\nBut what if I had 15, 20 different\napplications that I wanted easy access to?\n\n126\n00:06:14.364 --> 00:06:17.405\nWell, I'll start running\nout of room on my taskbar.\n\n127\n00:06:17.405 --> 00:06:20.238\nWith this fancy Start menu,\nI can create groups,\n\n128\n00:06:20.238 --> 00:06:22.270\nI can put all these tiles out there.\n\n129\n00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.488\nSo, then again, whatever works for you.\n\n130\n00:06:24.488 --> 00:06:29.135\n>> Now, Mike, I know that in previous\neditions of Excel, I could also take\n\n131\n00:06:29.135 --> 00:06:34.100\nan Excel workbook and actually directly\nclick on it, and that would open up.\n\n132\n00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.447\nAnd I'm assuming that still works?\n\n133\n00:06:35.447 --> 00:06:36.210\n>> Absolutely.\n\n134\n00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.722\nIf you already have a spreadsheet, or\n\n135\n00:06:38.722 --> 00:06:43.589\nsomebody emailed one to you as an\nattachment, or you copied one down off of\n\n136\n00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:48.161\na file server, you can simply find\nthat file, double-click on it.\n\n137\n00:06:48.161 --> 00:06:51.650\nAnd it's gonna open up cuz I've\ngot a file type association.\n\n138\n00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:55.846\nIt sees that you're clicking on\na spreadsheet, you've got Excel installed,\n\n139\n00:06:55.846 --> 00:06:57.422\nwhich is open spreadsheets.\n\n140\n00:06:57.422 --> 00:06:59.500\nSo, it'll go in there and\nit'll use Excel to open that up.\n\n141\n00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.914\nSo either way you go, it'll work.\n\n142\n00:07:01.914 --> 00:07:04.457\nAnd that's definitely a good\nway to do it as well.\n\n143\n00:07:04.457 --> 00:07:06.806\nEspecially as I said,\nif you've got an attachment,\n\n144\n00:07:06.806 --> 00:07:08.276\nyou copy it over to your desktop.\n\n145\n00:07:08.276 --> 00:07:12.303\nYou don't have to launch the application\nand then go file, open and browse and\n\n146\n00:07:12.303 --> 00:07:14.378\nfind it, just double-click on it, and\n\n147\n00:07:14.378 --> 00:07:17.018\nWindows will take care of\nopening it up with Excel.\n\n148\n00:07:17.018 --> 00:07:17.737\nAll right.\n\n149\n00:07:17.737 --> 00:07:20.766\nSo now, that we've got it installed and\nwe've got it set up so\n\n150\n00:07:20.766 --> 00:07:23.518\nwe can launch it easy,\nlet's go ahead and launch it up.\n\n151\n00:07:23.518 --> 00:07:25.828\nI'm gonna use my taskbar icon down there.\n\n152\n00:07:25.828 --> 00:07:28.836\nAnd I click that, and\nit's going to launch Excel.\n\n153\n00:07:28.836 --> 00:07:33.757\nWhen you first launch in to Excel,\nby default, you get this start screen.\n\n154\n00:07:33.757 --> 00:07:38.302\nAnd the start screen is fantastic because\nexcel saying, I don't really know what you\n\n155\n00:07:38.302 --> 00:07:41.663\nwanna do, I know that you wanted\nto launch Excel, so here I am.\n\n156\n00:07:41.663 --> 00:07:42.640\nBut I don't know what you wanna do.\n\n157\n00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.923\nDo you wanna work with an existing\ndocument, one you've worked with recently?\n\n158\n00:07:46.923 --> 00:07:50.174\nDo you want to create\na brand new document?\n\n159\n00:07:50.174 --> 00:07:51.679\nWould you like to use\none of these templates?\n\n160\n00:07:51.679 --> 00:07:54.267\nAnd we're gonna talk about all of\nthese options as we go through here.\n\n161\n00:07:54.267 --> 00:07:56.125\nBut that's what this start screen is for.\n\n162\n00:07:56.125 --> 00:07:57.587\nIs it saying.\n\n163\n00:07:57.587 --> 00:07:58.319\nWhat would like to do?\n\n164\n00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:01.883\nAnd you can see over here on the left,\nI have a list of Recent.\n\n165\n00:08:01.883 --> 00:08:06.080\nSo this is showing me documents\nthat I've worked with recently.\n\n166\n00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.320\nNow, this list will change as you\nopen up additional documents,\n\n167\n00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:14.800\nthe ones who haven't opened up in a while,\nwill slowly get bumped off this list,\n\n168\n00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.110\nreplaced with the ones you've\nopened up more recently.\n\n169\n00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:21.590\nIf you have one that you\ndon't open that often, but\n\n170\n00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:24.700\nyou want it to be on this list\nall the time, you can pin it.\n\n171\n00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:28.190\nYou see when I hover over this\nguy there's a little pin here?\n\n172\n00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:32.650\nIf I click on that, now that one\nis pinned to this recent list.\n\n173\n00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:35.560\nSo it will always be there,\neven if I don't open it up for\n\n174\n00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:39.060\na month,\nit'll still be at the top of the list.\n\n175\n00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:42.260\nAnother great thing that I love to do,\ncuz I've got a couple workbooks that\n\n176\n00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:46.370\nI always want quick access to but\nI don't open them up everyday.\n\n177\n00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:51.030\nSo I pin them to my list here and\nI can get quick easy access to them.\n\n178\n00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:54.530\nYou can do the same thing on\nyour jump list down here.\n\n179\n00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:58.170\nWhen I right click on the icon\nI get this jump list.\n\n180\n00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:58.820\nIt's the same thing.\n\n181\n00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:01.970\nIt's showing me these\nrecently opened spreadsheets.\n\n182\n00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:06.160\nIf I have one that I want to pin,\nI can simply click on the pushpin and\n\n183\n00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.740\nnow that one will always remain\nat the top of this list.\n\n184\n00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.880\nThese lists are independent.\n\n185\n00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.250\nRight, I pinned employees over here.\n\n186\n00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:16.590\nI don't have to pin employees on this one.\n\n187\n00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.130\nSo they are two different lists there.\n\n188\n00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:24.160\nThe other thing you can do is you\ncan browse and open other workbooks.\n\n189\n00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:28.065\nSo you can click on Open Other workbooks,\nand that's gonna take you to an area where\n\n190\n00:09:28.065 --> 00:09:32.925\nyou can go and open a file,\nI can click Browse, and I can navigate.\n\n191\n00:09:32.925 --> 00:09:36.685\nMaybe I've got a folder where I've\ndownloaded a bunch of spreadsheets,\n\n192\n00:09:36.685 --> 00:09:41.435\nI can simply navigate my way in,\nfind those spreadsheets, and\n\n193\n00:09:41.435 --> 00:09:45.080\nI can select it and\nopen that spreadsheet up.\n\n194\n00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.400\nLet me close that real quick.\n\n195\n00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.816\nWe'll go back out to\nour Start screen here.\n\n196\n00:09:50.107 --> 00:09:53.610\nIn fact, let me just relaunch so we can\ntake a look at that Start screen just\n\n197\n00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.940\na little bit more before we get into it.\n\n198\n00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.490\nSo we've got our recent list.\n\n199\n00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:00.930\nWe've got our browse capabilities\nto browse to other locations and\n\n200\n00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:03.490\nfind a document that we wanna open.\n\n201\n00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:06.140\nOver here on the right,\nwe've got these icons.\n\n202\n00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:09.770\nAnd the first one says, Blank Workbook.\n\n203\n00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:13.180\nThis would create,\nyou guessed it, a blank workbook.\n\n204\n00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.150\nSo if you're just trying to.\n\n205\n00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.330\nIf you're starting from scratch and\nyou wanna create a new workbook,\n\n206\n00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:17.540\nyou would simply click on it.\n\n207\n00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.060\nAnd it's gonna open up\na brand new workbook.\n\n208\n00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:25.510\nAnd then I can start working, and\nstart creating my new document.\n\n209\n00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:31.260\nNow the other ones, and I'll go back\nout one more time, we're going to\n\n210\n00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:35.630\ntalk about these in a later episode, these\nare templates, and they're really neat.\n\n211\n00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:36.920\nThey give me a starting point.\n\n212\n00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.030\nInstead of starting with a blank workbook,\n\n213\n00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:42.500\nI can actually start with\na pre-built template.\n\n214\n00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.040\nGive me a head start on whatever\nproject I'm working on.\n\n215\n00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.750\nI'll show you how to use those\nin a little bit in the future.\n\n216\n00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:50.852\nSo for now, let's just stick\nwith a good old blank workbook,\n\n217\n00:10:50.852 --> 00:10:54.372\nbecause the next thing I wanna show\nus Ron, is the interface itself and\n\n218\n00:10:54.372 --> 00:10:56.600\nhow we can go about\nnavigating around here.\n\n219\n00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.620\n>> You know Mike, I actually\ntake a look at the other top and\n\n220\n00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:03.195\nI see that just on that first\nscreen that you open up.\n\n221\n00:11:03.195 --> 00:11:06.350\nThere looks like a ton of\ndifferent tools up there and\n\n222\n00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:09.620\nI think if I was first time using it,\nI would get a bit intimidated.\n\n223\n00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:12.740\n>> Absolutely, it can be a little\nfrightening when you first see this.\n\n224\n00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:15.980\nBut, never fear,\nwe're going to make sense of all of it.\n\n225\n00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:20.730\nOne of the things that Microsoft did,\nand I believe this started in 2007,\n\n226\n00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:24.100\nthey went to what we call a ribbon format.\n\n227\n00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.720\nBefore that we had those menus.\n\n228\n00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.170\nSo if you've been using\napplications in the past,\n\n229\n00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:32.860\nyou might remember we had to click on\nFile, and a drop down list would appear.\n\n230\n00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.510\nAnd the problem with that was one,\n\n231\n00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:37.330\nit would end up covering up\npart of your document, so\n\n232\n00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:41.400\nas you drop the different menus down\nit would hide some of your document,\n\n233\n00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:46.850\nwhich is always a kind of a pain when you\nwould wanna select a font, for example.\n\n234\n00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:51.180\nAnd it would hide the font itself,\nso they went to these ribbons, and\n\n235\n00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:56.030\nit allows them to make everything\navailable easily right at my finger tips.\n\n236\n00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:57.310\nAs we go through here,\n\n237\n00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:02.510\nwe'll see there's actually see several\nRibbons across the top of this workbook.\n\n238\n00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:07.790\nI got my Home Ribbon and\nhere I've got a lot of my common tools.\n\n239\n00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:11.010\nThings like Cut Copy and\nPaste are going to be out here.\n\n240\n00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:16.960\nThe ability to change my Font and my Font\nsize and my Font color, my Alignment.\n\n241\n00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.400\nAnd you'll notice,\nthey're organized, right?\n\n242\n00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:23.040\nThere's little dividing lines between\nthere and I can see the word alignment\n\n243\n00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:27.710\nright here, so between these two lines,\nthis is known as a ribbon group and this\n\n244\n00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:33.200\nis where all of the alignment tools reside\nand there's another group for numbers.\n\n245\n00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.430\nFor like formatting.\n\n246\n00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:36.450\nThere's another group for styles.\n\n247\n00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:37.980\nAnother one for cells.\n\n248\n00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:42.370\nSo they're trying to organize these tools,\nmake them a little bit easier to find.\n\n249\n00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:44.530\nAnd then we've got several\ndifferent ribbons.\n\n250\n00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:46.350\nWe've got the insert ribbon,\n\n251\n00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:49.330\nwhich is where all my tools that\nI would use to insert things.\n\n252\n00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:52.840\nLike inserting pivot tables,\nor inserting illustrations, or\n\n253\n00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:56.250\ninserting Charts or filters, okay?\n\n254\n00:12:56.250 --> 00:13:00.590\nIf I move on, I've got my Page Layout\nribbon and as you would expect, this is\n\n255\n00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:03.870\nwhere I can find things that are gonna\naffect the layout of the page itself.\n\n256\n00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:08.780\nMargins, Orientation,\nLandscape versus Portrait and\n\n257\n00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:14.350\nmy Print Area,\nmy Gridlines are gonna be on there.\n\n258\n00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:15.350\nKeep moving down the row.\n\n259\n00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:20.550\nI've got a Formulas ribbon, where I can\nfind all of my functions and formulas.\n\n260\n00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:23.700\nI've got my data ribbon\nwhere I can work with data.\n\n261\n00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.220\nI can import data.\n\n262\n00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:27.700\nI can go out and\nget it from an external source.\n\n263\n00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.070\nI can set up data connections.\n\n264\n00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:32.410\nWe can sort and filter the data.\n\n265\n00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:36.130\nI've got a data tools,\nI've got forecast tools.\n\n266\n00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:40.270\nSo all the things that I would use to\nwork with the actual data reside here.\n\n267\n00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:44.810\nI've got a review ribbon and this is\nwhere I would find all my review tools.\n\n268\n00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:49.050\nMy thesaurus,\nmy spell checker, my comments,\n\n269\n00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:52.530\nmy translation,\nall of that's gonna be here.\n\n270\n00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:58.140\nAnd then that last ribbon they have is\na View Menu, where as you might expect,\n\n271\n00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.300\nI find tools to change the way\nI'm looking at things.\n\n272\n00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.660\nWhere I can zoom in or\nout of this document.\n\n273\n00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:08.830\nI can change between a normal\nview verses a print preview.\n\n274\n00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:13.900\nI can split the panes or\nhide certain areas or combine windows.\n\n275\n00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:17.040\nWe can do all kinds of things, again,\nthings that have to do with the view.\n\n276\n00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.990\nSo you start to see how\nthese tools are organized.\n\n277\n00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:21.270\nSo there are a lot of tools, right.\n\n278\n00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:24.690\nAs Ronnie said, it can be a little bit\nintimidating, though you start to realize\n\n279\n00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:28.210\nthat they've tried to organize them\nto make them easier to work with.\n\n280\n00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:32.580\nSo they're all out there, we just have\nto remember what ribbon they're on.\n\n281\n00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:35.020\nIt really does, I think,\n\n282\n00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:39.000\nin the end make it a lot easier to\nwork with once you get used to it.\n\n283\n00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.150\nIf you're used to the old menu\ndriven systems, as Ronnie said,\n\n284\n00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:43.810\nit might be a little bit intimidating.\n\n285\n00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:46.890\nOnce you get used to it,\nyou'll find you really really like, or\n\n286\n00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:49.840\nI think you'll really\nreally like these ribbons.\n\n287\n00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:54.280\nAnother cool thing about all the tools\nbeing out here like this is that we can\n\n288\n00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.670\none see them, right?\n\n289\n00:14:55.670 --> 00:15:00.060\nCuz they're tools in Excel 2003\nthat you probably never even saw.\n\n290\n00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:02.800\nThey were there, but\nyou never dove down into that menu,\n\n291\n00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.490\ndidn't even realize they were there.\n\n292\n00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:07.290\nHere you get to see just about everything.\n\n293\n00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:10.520\nAnd if you don't know what something is,\nyou can just hover over it.\n\n294\n00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:13.660\nAnd you're gonna get a little tool tip,\nlike if you didn't know what that\n\n295\n00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:16.520\nbutton did, all I'm doing is putting\nmy cursor, I'm not clicking.\n\n296\n00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:20.690\nI'm just moving my cursor over that icon\nand it's telling me oh, that's center.\n\n297\n00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:25.030\nAnd if I click that it's\ngonna center my content.\n\n298\n00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:26.510\nThis one over here, what does that do?\n\n299\n00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:28.740\nOh it's a percent style,\n\n300\n00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:32.970\nit'll format whatever I have\nselected as a percent, right?\n\n301\n00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:37.210\nSo take your time and explore,\nhover over all these different buttons,\n\n302\n00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:38.960\nsee what the heck they do.\n\n303\n00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:44.400\nAnd that way you'll start to become\na little more comfortable with those.\n\n304\n00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.434\nNow as I said not all of\nthe tools are out here.\n\n305\n00:15:47.434 --> 00:15:50.952\nThey do try to fit as many as they can out\nthere but two things are gonna happen.\n\n306\n00:15:50.952 --> 00:15:53.482\nOne Your resolution can mess you up.\n\n307\n00:15:53.482 --> 00:15:57.871\nLet me minimize this for, or\nnot minimize but I'm gonna restore down.\n\n308\n00:15:57.871 --> 00:16:02.602\nIf you'd notice like these cells,\nI've got this big old button for\n\n309\n00:16:02.602 --> 00:16:05.690\nInsert, Delete, and Format.\n\n310\n00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:07.938\nWell I'm gonna make my window\na little bit smaller, and\n\n311\n00:16:07.938 --> 00:16:12.710\nnotice now I have these little tiny\nbuttons for Insert, Delete, and Format.\n\n312\n00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:16.968\nAnd heck if I can press it even more,\nI don't know if it'll much more.\n\n313\n00:16:16.968 --> 00:16:21.830\nYou'll start seeing some of these other\nbuttons start disappearing, right?\n\n314\n00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:23.770\nBecause there's just no more room for it.\n\n315\n00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:26.870\nI maximize it, and they come back out.\n\n316\n00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:30.740\nSo, you might be at one machine, and\nyou've got these nice big buttons, and\n\n317\n00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.990\nthen you go home or\non a different computer at work.\n\n318\n00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:33.827\nAnd all of a sudden,\n\n319\n00:16:33.827 --> 00:16:37.540\nthose buttons don't look the same, or\nthey're not in quite the same place.\n\n320\n00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:38.170\nWell, don't panic.\n\n321\n00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:41.470\nIt's probably just because either\nthe window's not maximized or\n\n322\n00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:42.530\nthe resolution is different.\n\n323\n00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:46.490\nIf it's a smaller screen,\nthey can't fit all those buttons on there.\n\n324\n00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:52.180\nThey'll make them a little bit smaller so\nthey can fit them the best they can.\n\n325\n00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:56.180\nNow even then, they can't show me\nall the tools on these ribbons.\n\n326\n00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:59.970\nSome of these groups you'll\nnotice have a little button\n\n327\n00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:02.050\ndown in the bottom right hand corner.\n\n328\n00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:04.590\nThose are my dialog box launchers.\n\n329\n00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:09.530\nSo for like my font,\nI can see I can choose my font, my size.\n\n330\n00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:12.170\nI can do an increase and\ndecrease on my font.\n\n331\n00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:13.850\nI can do my bold, italics, underline.\n\n332\n00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:17.300\nI've got some border options,\ncolor options.\n\n333\n00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:18.060\nThat's not everything.\n\n334\n00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:22.070\nIf I click this little button down here,\nthis dialog box launcher,\n\n335\n00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:25.980\nit opens up a whole another dialog box.\n\n336\n00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:29.200\nAnd now I can see things like\nStrikethrough and Superscript and\n\n337\n00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.570\nSubscript.\n\n338\n00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:33.480\nThose weren't out there because\nthere wasn't enough room.\n\n339\n00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.450\nOr maybe they felt like we\ndon't use those often enough\n\n340\n00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:38.690\nto put them out there on the ribbon.\n\n341\n00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:41.702\nSo it's another thing to keep in\nmind as you're going through here.\n\n342\n00:17:41.702 --> 00:17:44.062\nIf you don't see the tool\nyou're looking for,\n\n343\n00:17:44.062 --> 00:17:47.427\nlook to see if there's a little\ndialog box launcher in that group and\n\n344\n00:17:47.427 --> 00:17:51.400\nyou'll probably get some more options,\nmore than what show up on your ribbon.\n\n345\n00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:55.820\nNow another thing that we have to\nworry about with this ribbons is,\n\n346\n00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:57.180\nnot all of them are there.\n\n347\n00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:00.430\nSome of the ribbons are what\nwe call contextual ribbons and\n\n348\n00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:03.380\nyou only see them when you need them.\n\n349\n00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.618\nFor example, let me open up a file here.\n\n350\n00:18:06.618 --> 00:18:10.494\nI'm gonna do a little File > Open and\nthen I'll navigate over to My Documents.\n\n351\n00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:17.240\nAnd there we go, it looked like\na blank workbook for a second.\n\n352\n00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.900\nI almost panicked.\n\n353\n00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:23.321\nSo here's one, and I can see my standard\nribbons, Home, Insert, Page Layout,\n\n354\n00:18:23.321 --> 00:18:25.452\nFormulas, Data, Review, and View.\n\n355\n00:18:25.452 --> 00:18:27.650\nBut watch what happens when\nI click on this table.\n\n356\n00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.380\nI get a whole another menu, or\nwhole other ribbon, I should say.\n\n357\n00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:35.350\nIt's my TableTools design ribbon.\n\n358\n00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:39.410\nBecause I have a table selected,\nit says, hey, how about I show you\n\n359\n00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:43.950\nsome cool things you can do with tables,\nlike changing the style of the table.\n\n360\n00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:48.830\nOr changing, you can see it kind of\nchanges as I hover over these guys.\n\n361\n00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:51.250\nOr changing the header rows or\n\n362\n00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:54.620\nthe filter buttons,\nthings that you would do with a table.\n\n363\n00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:57.970\nIf I click away from that\ntable that ribbon goes away.\n\n364\n00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:00.670\nExcel says well,\nyou don't have a table selected,\n\n365\n00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:04.680\nwhy bother taking up space\nshowing you those table tools?\n\n366\n00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:08.760\nSame thing with a chart, if I click\non this chart I get two more ribbons.\n\n367\n00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:13.840\nI get my Chart Design ribbon where I\ncan change the style of that chart.\n\n368\n00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:18.430\nI've also got my Chart Format ribbon,\nwhere I can change things like my shape\n\n369\n00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:23.640\nstyles, and my word art, and\nformat the text that's on that chat.\n\n370\n00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.450\nClick away, and those two ribbons go away.\n\n371\n00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:30.860\nSo those are known as contextual ribbons,\nand I wanna bring them up, one,\n\n372\n00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:32.700\nbecause we need to know they're there.\n\n373\n00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:36.840\nAnd two, I've seen people panic, they'll\nhave a table on their spreadsheet, but\n\n374\n00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:40.630\ntheir cursor's over here somewhere.\n\n375\n00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:44.240\nWell as soon as you click away from that\ntable those ribbons are gonna go away.\n\n376\n00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:48.880\nNever fear, click back on the table and\nthat ribbon will show right back up.\n\n377\n00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.350\nSo those are known as contextual ribbons.\n\n378\n00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:54.070\nAnother thing we can do with\nthese ribbons is we can hide them\n\n379\n00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:56.630\non a smaller screen like I've got here.\n\n380\n00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:59.220\nThese ribbons take up a lot\nof valuable real estate.\n\n381\n00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:03.550\nThat's less rows that I can look at\nbecause this ribbon is out here.\n\n382\n00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:07.370\nWell over here on the far right hand side,\nI've got a little chevron\n\n383\n00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:10.490\nthat I can click, and\nthat will collapse that ribbon up.\n\n384\n00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:11.410\n>> Nice.\n\n385\n00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:15.450\n>> Now they're still there,\nif I want to use them, I can click on it,\n\n386\n00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:19.890\ndo whatever it is I need to do, and\nwhen I click away, it goes away.\n\n387\n00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:22.620\nSo it gives me that extra real estate.\n\n388\n00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.490\nAnother way can work with that ribbon,\nthat collapse and\n\n389\n00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:30.800\nbring it back is this little button\nright to the left of my minimize.\n\n390\n00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:35.202\nThis is the ability to\nauto-hide the ribbon.\n\n391\n00:20:35.202 --> 00:20:40.730\nSo now, personally I can't get\nused to the auto-hide option.\n\n392\n00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:41.696\n>> Right.\n>> But the auto-hide,\n\n393\n00:20:41.696 --> 00:20:43.411\nlook how much more real estate I have,\nright?\n\n394\n00:20:43.411 --> 00:20:48.710\nNow I'm seeing 30 rows whereas before\nI was only seeing like 20 rows.\n\n395\n00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:49.600\nThe ribbons are still there,\n\n396\n00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:53.740\nif I go up to the top,\nit will come back down, supposedly.\n\n397\n00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.360\nThere it goes, and\nnow I can work with those and\n\n398\n00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:00.670\nsoon as I go away, it just slides\nback up out of the way, all right.\n\n399\n00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:02.790\nSo that's the way that auto-hide works,\n\n400\n00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:07.810\nthe other options, Show Tabs, well now I'm\nback to basically having them collapsed.\n\n401\n00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:11.435\nI can see the tabs but\nthey don't completely hide.\n\n402\n00:21:11.435 --> 00:21:16.630\nThat third option, Show Tabs and Commands,\nbrings the whole thing back out.\n\n403\n00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:19.360\nSo, whatever makes you happy, right?\n\n404\n00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.430\nWhatever works for\nyou and your work style.\n\n405\n00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:23.050\nHide that ribbon altogether.\n\n406\n00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:24.240\nCollapse it up.\n\n407\n00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.840\nLeave it out all the time.\n\n408\n00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.510\nIt's cool that Excel gives us that option.\n\n409\n00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:31.820\n>> Now Mike, there's actually some other\nneat benefits inside of Excel as we\n\n410\n00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:32.880\nchange things.\n\n411\n00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:36.670\nWe don't have to wait for things to kind\nof appear, change them, and do that.\n\n412\n00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:39.620\nThere's actually something that\nwe call live preview, right?\n\n413\n00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:41.250\n>> I love the live preview feature, and\n\n414\n00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:43.830\nyou might have seen it as I was\ngoing through some of these.\n\n415\n00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:44.660\nLike for example,\n\n416\n00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:49.580\nwhen I click on this chart, that's\ngonna bring up my chart design ribbon.\n\n417\n00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:54.000\nAnd here I have what's called a gallery,\nright, instead of seeing text in a menu,\n\n418\n00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.210\nthey're showing me actual pictures\nof different chart styles.\n\n419\n00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:02.460\nAnd as I hover over these chart styles,\nnotice the chart changes.\n\n420\n00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.980\nI'm not clicking, right,\nI haven't made any changes.\n\n421\n00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:08.810\nIf I go away, my chart is still that\nblack with the blue and orange.\n\n422\n00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:13.611\nBut as I hover over these different chart\nstyles, you'll see that it gives me what\n\n423\n00:22:13.611 --> 00:22:18.286\nwe call, as Ronnie was saying, a live\npreview of what it's going to look like.\n\n424\n00:22:18.286 --> 00:22:21.960\nSo I can decide,\nis this what I want before I change it?\n\n425\n00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.589\nAnd I'll tell you Ronnie,\nI have used that several times,\n\n426\n00:22:24.589 --> 00:22:28.286\nespecially with things like fonts because\nsometimes picking a font is difficult.\n\n427\n00:22:28.286 --> 00:22:29.994\n>> Right.\n\n428\n00:22:29.994 --> 00:22:32.370\n>> I know especially for me because\nI'm not the most creative person.\n\n429\n00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:34.510\nBut I need to see what\nit's gonna look like.\n\n430\n00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:35.410\nWhat is it gonna change?\n\n431\n00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:42.010\nCuz sometimes, like if I choose this cell\ndown here, and I go up to my font list.\n\n432\n00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:48.118\nAs I go down through these fonts, you can\nsee it changing down there at the bottom.\n\n433\n00:22:48.118 --> 00:22:51.630\nSome of the fonts are a little bit\nmore bold or a little bit larger.\n\n434\n00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:55.320\nYou can even see the row\nsize changing slightly.\n\n435\n00:22:55.320 --> 00:23:00.100\nThat's a lot easier than having to select\nit, and then go back and look on it, and\n\n436\n00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:01.380\nthen go change it again.\n\n437\n00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:03.840\nAnd then go back and look at it, right?\n\n438\n00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:07.090\nThat live preview is fantastic, love that.\n\n439\n00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:09.450\nSo you get the galleries and\nyou get the live previews.\n\n440\n00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:13.510\nOther things we've got up here,\nwe've got our Quick Access toolbar.\n\n441\n00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:16.610\nThat resides right above my menu up here,\nand\n\n442\n00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:20.310\nthis is just some things\nthat we commonly use.\n\n443\n00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:22.700\nMy Save icon is up here.\n\n444\n00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:27.140\nMy Undo and Redo options are up here.\n\n445\n00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:28.744\nI think I might have customized that.\n\n446\n00:23:28.744 --> 00:23:33.229\nThat's because it's sensing that I\nhave a touchscreen on this laptop so\n\n447\n00:23:33.229 --> 00:23:35.000\nI've got touch mouse mode.\n\n448\n00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.067\nSo I can change this from\nmouse mode to touch mode, but\n\n449\n00:23:38.067 --> 00:23:41.476\nthat quick access tool bar,\nthese stay there no matter what\n\n450\n00:23:41.476 --> 00:23:45.716\nribbon I have selected or no matter\nwhat I have selected in the worksheet.\n\n451\n00:23:45.716 --> 00:23:50.057\nThose are going to stay there so\nWe're going to see later on.\n\n452\n00:23:50.057 --> 00:23:52.217\nWe can actually customize that.\n\n453\n00:23:52.217 --> 00:23:54.094\nWe can even add additional things to it,\nbut\n\n454\n00:23:54.094 --> 00:23:57.673\nthose are things that are always going to\nbe there no matter what you have selected.\n\n455\n00:23:57.673 --> 00:24:02.900\nNow at the bottom of the screen we\nhave what's called our status bar.\n\n456\n00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:04.910\nYou can see where it says the word ready.\n\n457\n00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:07.160\nDown on the bottom left hand corner.\n\n458\n00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:10.030\nThis is a good thing to keep an eye on.\n\n459\n00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:13.290\nSometimes it can give you a little\ninformation like if Excels stops\n\n460\n00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:16.480\nresponding or seems sluggish,\nyou might look down here and\n\n461\n00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.920\nsays that it's in the process of saving.\n\n462\n00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.110\nAnd if it's reaching out\nto a network location,\n\n463\n00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:23.700\nmaybe it's slowing things down for\na little bit.\n\n464\n00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:27.630\nOr to doing some major calculations and\nit's busy, right?\n\n465\n00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:30.030\nSo look down there for your status.\n\n466\n00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:33.870\nThe other cool thing about the status bar\nis it can actually show you information.\n\n467\n00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:39.120\nIf you look over here to the right,\nI've got nothing on my status bar.\n\n468\n00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:44.680\nBut if I select a bunch of numbers,\nnotice that it changes.\n\n469\n00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:48.990\nNow all the sudden I've got\nan average a count and a sum, right?\n\n470\n00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:53.760\nSo anytime I select numbers, Excel says,\na lot of times when people select numbers,\n\n471\n00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:54.970\nthey need to see a sum.\n\n472\n00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:56.890\nOr they wanna see an average.\n\n473\n00:24:56.890 --> 00:24:58.110\nWell, let's put it out there.\n\n474\n00:24:58.110 --> 00:24:59.210\nI didn't have to write a formula.\n\n475\n00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:02.140\nI didn't have to occupy\na cell with anything.\n\n476\n00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.760\nI can just quickly select these guys and\nget it.\n\n477\n00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.100\nCounts are extremely handy.\n\n478\n00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:08.160\nWhat if I wanna know how many I've got?\n\n479\n00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:08.870\nI can see there's 19.\n\n480\n00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:12.970\nI didn't have to sit there and\ngo one, two, three, four, five or\n\n481\n00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:14.130\nanything like that.\n\n482\n00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:16.230\nSo love that little status bar down there.\n\n483\n00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:20.550\nSomething else that we can customize,\nwe'll learn about that later on.\n\n484\n00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:23.400\nAll right, what else we got Ronnie?\n\n485\n00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:27.620\nOh something new in 2016\nis this good old tell me.\n\n486\n00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:32.550\nUp at the very top of our ribbons we'll\nsee this tell me what you want to do.\n\n487\n00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:34.950\nThis is a pretty cool new feature.\n\n488\n00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:38.220\nBasically, you get to\nask Excel a question.\n\n489\n00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:41.320\nOr tell it, I should say,\nwhat you wanna do.\n\n490\n00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:44.810\nLet's say I want to make this bold.\n\n491\n00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:48.010\nAnd I don't know where the tool\nis on any of these ribbons.\n\n492\n00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:53.260\nSo I'm gonna just type in bold and\nsure there's the tool and it\n\n493\n00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:57.240\neven just went ahead and made it bold, or\nmaybe I wanna to strike through on that.\n\n494\n00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:04.230\nAnd you could see is if I could spell\nthere it found my strike through options.\n\n495\n00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:06.260\nOr I can open up my font settings.\n\n496\n00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:08.180\nOr I can get help on whatever I've typed.\n\n497\n00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:09.590\nAll right.\n\n498\n00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:11.940\nSo I can go ahead and strike through that.\n\n499\n00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:19.280\nOr what if I want to get, let's see, I\nwanna add an auto sum to this column here.\n\n500\n00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:23.167\nI could come up here and\nI can say auto sum.\n\n501\n00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:25.620\nAnd there's my option right there.\n\n502\n00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:31.520\nI didn't have to go hunt for it on\na ribbon, I simply click it and of course\n\n503\n00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:34.580\nit summed up the wrong thing because I\ndidn't tell it what I was trying to.\n\n504\n00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:38.090\nI only had one number selected so\nit was a little difficult to do a sum.\n\n505\n00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:41.140\nBut you get the idea right.\n\n506\n00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:48.130\nWhatever it is that you want to do,\nif I want to insert a chart all right.\n\n507\n00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:51.690\nThere's my insert column or\nbar chart, insert static chart.\n\n508\n00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:54.690\nThe idea is,\nI don't have to know where the tool is.\n\n509\n00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:56.640\nI don't even have to\nknow what the tool is.\n\n510\n00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:00.570\nAll I have to do is tell it what I want\nto do, and it's gonna help me out.\n\n511\n00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:03.609\nSo Excel is pretty fancy\nwhen it comes to that.\n\n512\n00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:05.890\nAll right.\n\n513\n00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:07.960\nLast thing that we need to do here,\nRonnie,\n\n514\n00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.940\nis we need to explore\nthe whole saving options.\n\n515\n00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:14.698\nOne of the important things we're gonna\ndo with our spreadsheets is make sure we\n\n516\n00:27:14.698 --> 00:27:15.268\nsave them.\n\n517\n00:27:15.268 --> 00:27:16.607\nRight?\n\n518\n00:27:16.607 --> 00:27:18.177\nWe don't wanna do all this work and\n\n519\n00:27:18.177 --> 00:27:20.940\nthen have to do it again\nbecause we forgot to save it.\n\n520\n00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:22.370\nSo let's take a look at that.\n\n521\n00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:23.400\nThey've kinda moved it.\n\n522\n00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.500\nIf you click on this little Save icon.\n\n523\n00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:29.480\nThis particular workbook has\nalready been saved once.\n\n524\n00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:33.880\nIt was one that I opened and\ncreated earlier and saved this, so\n\n525\n00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:38.230\nonce I open it, if I click Save, it\nsimply gonna save it with the same name,\n\n526\n00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:40.820\nin the same location and the same format.\n\n527\n00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:42.450\nBecause it already knows all that, but\n\n528\n00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:45.930\nwhat if we have a new document\nI'm gonna close this guy here,\n\n529\n00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:49.340\ngo back to this new document,\nthis one's never been saved before.\n\n530\n00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:54.540\nSo if I click on this, it's gonna take me\nover to what's called my backstage area.\n\n531\n00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:57.320\nNow, if you don't wanna\nuse that little icon, or\n\n532\n00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:01.040\nif you have removed it from\nyour Quick Access toolbar,\n\n533\n00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:06.550\nyou can click on this File tab, which will\nalso take you to this backstage area.\n\n534\n00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:07.770\nYou can do a keyboard shortcut.\n\n535\n00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:09.820\nYou can do a control S as well.\n\n536\n00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:13.530\nAnd that gets you to your\nwhere you can save or save as.\n\n537\n00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:17.410\nRemember, to save a document,\nyou need three things.\n\n538\n00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:20.350\nI used to say two things, but\nnow you really need three things.\n\n539\n00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:24.860\nYou need a name for the document, you\nneed a location to put the document and\n\n540\n00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:27.900\nyou need a format that you\nwant to save the document in.\n\n541\n00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:31.880\nSo, if this has never been saved before,\nwhen I click Save,\n\n542\n00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:36.390\nit's actually gonna up Save As, and\nI can choose where I want to save it.\n\n543\n00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:38.820\nNow, I'm gonna browse to\na location on my computer here.\n\n544\n00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:44.197\nI'm gonna go in this little folder called\nExcel, and we'll call this Episode One.\n\n545\n00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.240\nAnd so I'm giving the name.\n\n546\n00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:53.000\nI browsed to my documents excel folder,\nso I've given it a location.\n\n547\n00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.330\nThere's two things I need.\n\n548\n00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:56.350\nThe last thing I need is the format.\n\n549\n00:28:56.350 --> 00:29:00.170\nAnd by default it's gonna save it as\na spreadsheet, because this is excel.\n\n550\n00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:02.020\nThat's its default format.\n\n551\n00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:06.880\nThe extension on an Excel\nspreadsheet is a .xlsx,\n\n552\n00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:11.300\nso if I name it Episode One,\nit's gonna be Episode One.xlsx.\n\n553\n00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:15.810\nBut what if I needed to share\nthis with somebody else and\n\n554\n00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:17.470\nthey didn't use the same\nversion of Office?\n\n555\n00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:19.990\nThey haven't upgraded yet to 2016.\n\n556\n00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:22.850\nWell I can still make\nthis available to them.\n\n557\n00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:25.840\nI can come in here and\nI can hit my drop down list, and\n\n558\n00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:28.370\nI can choose a different format.\n\n559\n00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:31.500\nInstead of saving it in that\nnew Excel format, I can say,\n\n560\n00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:35.930\nI need to be compatible\nwith Excel 97 through 2003.\n\n561\n00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:38.100\nAll right.\nThat's gonna change the extension,\n\n562\n00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:40.710\nI don't think we're all\ntoo concerned with that.\n\n563\n00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:43.380\nIt's a .xlx if anybody out there cares.\n\n564\n00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:47.060\nBut what I'm trying to show\nyou is you have options.\n\n565\n00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:47.560\nRight?\n\n566\n00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:50.890\nMaybe you need to take this data\nthat's in your spreadsheet and\n\n567\n00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:55.470\nbring it into another application that\ndoesn't understand what a spreadsheet is.\n\n568\n00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:58.740\nI can save it as something\nknown as comma separated value.\n\n569\n00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:02.140\nAgain, If this is something you're not\nfamiliar with, don't worry about it.\n\n570\n00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:05.990\nWe're not here to learn about\nthe different types of formats,\n\n571\n00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.610\nand things like that.\n\n572\n00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:10.490\nI just wanna make sure you're\naware that Excel is very powerful.\n\n573\n00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:13.360\nAnd it will try to provide\nthat compatibility.\n\n574\n00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.690\nSo if you need to share your\ninformation with somebody else, and\n\n575\n00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:17.260\nthey're not using Excel.\n\n576\n00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:20.620\nThere's a good chance you can find\na format that both your applications\n\n577\n00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:21.210\nwill agree upon.\n\n578\n00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:25.660\nIt allow you to share that data, or even\nbringing in data from other application.\n\n579\n00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:30.250\nSo when you go to save it,\nmake sure if you need to save that,\n\n580\n00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:34.880\nchange your file type\nusing this save as type.\n\n581\n00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.870\nI'm gonna change that back to\njust the default Excel workbook.\n\n582\n00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:38.510\nI'll click Save.\n\n583\n00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:43.620\nAnd now you'll see up in my title bar,\nit has the title that I gave it.\n\n584\n00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:44.490\nRight?\nEpisode One.\n\n585\n00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:47.410\nAnd it's now saved in My Documents.\n\n586\n00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:48.725\nIf I browse over there.\n\n587\n00:30:48.725 --> 00:30:51.690\nDocuments>Excel.\n\n588\n00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:53.320\nThere's Episode 1.\n\n589\n00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:55.268\nAnd now if I make changes to this.\n\n590\n00:30:57.962 --> 00:31:00.735\nI don't have to go through all that\nagain if I don't wanna change the name\n\n591\n00:31:00.735 --> 00:31:01.760\nor location.\n\n592\n00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:04.750\nAll I have to do is click Save,\nand I'm good to go.\n\n593\n00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:05.460\nSo there you go.\n\n594\n00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:10.190\nWe've got Excel from beginning to end\nas far as exploring that interface,\n\n595\n00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:12.850\nlaunching it up all the way\nto saving our document.\n\n596\n00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:16.280\n>> Well Mike, that's a lot of information\nfor us to actually think about.\n\n597\n00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.630\nBut remember, if we're actually\njust trying to get use and\n\n598\n00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:20.130\nget started with Excel, right,\n\n599\n00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:23.660\none of the most important things is that\nyou feel comfortable in the interface.\n\n600\n00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:27.220\nBeing able to know how to launch it\nwithout having to search for it.\n\n601\n00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:30.920\nCreating those desktop shortcuts or\neven on the task bar, or\n\n602\n00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.780\npinning it to our Start menu.\n\n603\n00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:36.060\nKind of very neat things that we can do\nright away that gets us comfortable with\n\n604\n00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:36.990\nlaunching it.\n\n605\n00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:39.630\nAnd then by exploring the interface\nin the way that we have,\n\n606\n00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:42.350\nwe actually understand that all\nof those tools are available for\n\n607\n00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:46.050\nus when we create work books, or\nwhen we have to modify work books as well.\n\n608\n00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:49.030\nAnd just getting used to understanding\nthe way that it's displaying\n\n609\n00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:51.740\nis really gonna help knowing\nwhere things are, right,\n\n610\n00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:54.910\nis 50% of the challenge\nof actually using Excel.\n\n611\n00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:57.280\nAnd once you start actually\nbeing comfortable with that,\n\n612\n00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:01.080\nthen creating workbooks, again, modifying\nthem is not going to be so difficult.\n\n613\n00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:03.050\nSo again, thank you, Mike, for helping us.\n\n614\n00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:04.400\nWith that as well.\n\n615\n00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:07.890\nAnd you still want to stay tuned for\nmore here for Excel 2016.\n\n616\n00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:10.800\nWe got plenty more episodes coming up.\n\n617\n00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:15.080\nSigning off for IT PRO TV I'm Ronnie Wong\n>> And I'm Mike Roderick and\n\n618\n00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:21.959\nwe'll see you next time [SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:17.710\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n4\n00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.570\ntoday we're gonna be taking a look\nat working with Excel 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.260\nNow we're specifically gonna be\ndealing with workbooks and worksheets.\n\n6\n00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.740\nAnd so who better to help us than Mr.\nMike Rodrick.\n\n7\n00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.701\nNow Mike, when it comes down to it,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n8\n00:00:29.701 --> 00:00:32.390\nanswer the lifelong question here\nthat everybody wants to know.\n\n9\n00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.817\nWhat is the different\nbetween a workbook and\n\n10\n00:00:34.817 --> 00:00:37.588\na worksheet as we get\nstarted into 2016 here?\n\n11\n00:00:37.588 --> 00:00:39.676\n>> [LAUGH] That's a great question Ronnie,\nand\n\n12\n00:00:39.676 --> 00:00:42.670\nit is something we really\nneed to understand, right?\n\n13\n00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.300\nWhen we talk about worksheets and\nworkbooks,\n\n14\n00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.790\nsome people might use those\nterms interchangeably.\n\n15\n00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.370\nBut the truth of it is\nthe workbook is the container.\n\n16\n00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.610\nThe workbook contains worksheets.\n\n17\n00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.835\nSo when you create a new, some people say,\nI'm gonna go create a new spreadsheet.\n\n18\n00:00:58.835 --> 00:01:02.750\nWell, really, when you open up Excel,\nyou're creating a new workbook.\n\n19\n00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.440\nAnd then, within that book,\nyou're gonna contain worksheets.\n\n20\n00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.540\nAnd a workbook can contain a single\nsheet or it can contain several sheets.\n\n21\n00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.000\nLet's take a look and\nI'll show you what I mean here.\n\n22\n00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.070\nAll right, so when I launch Excel, we're\ngonna come to that good old start screen,\n\n23\n00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.810\nand notice I've got the option for\nblank workbook.\n\n24\n00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.360\nNot worksheet, right, workbook.\n\n25\n00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.860\nAnd when we create that workbook,\nthere we go, we've got a new workbook,\n\n26\n00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.850\nwithin that workbook I have one worksheet.\n\n27\n00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.480\nSo again,\nthe workbook is the outer container.\n\n28\n00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.546\nThe worksheets are the tabs,\nif you will, within that workbook.\n\n29\n00:01:36.546 --> 00:01:41.920\nAnd again I could have one or I could have\nseveral worksheets within this workbook.\n\n30\n00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.163\nAnother thing I wanna point out that's\na little bit different if you haven't used\n\n31\n00:01:45.163 --> 00:01:45.921\nOffice in a while.\n\n32\n00:01:45.921 --> 00:01:50.930\nIn the past, we could work with more\nthan one workbook in a single window.\n\n33\n00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.290\nWell, now with Excel if I do File ->\nNew and create another workbook, you'll\n\n34\n00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.490\nsee I have up here Book2, but if I restore\ndown you'll see I have a second window.\n\n35\n00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.284\nSo, unlike some of the older\nversions of Office,\n\n36\n00:02:05.284 --> 00:02:10.086\neach workbook is now gonna be found in its\nown window when you're working with Excel.\n\n37\n00:02:10.086 --> 00:02:11.260\nAll right?\n\n38\n00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.480\nSo, a blank workbook is\na good place to start,\n\n39\n00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.350\nif you have an idea of what you wanna do.\n\n40\n00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.160\nIf you wanna start importing some data or\n\n41\n00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.280\nyou wanna start entering some data,\nmaybe a blank workbook is what you need.\n\n42\n00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.610\nOther times, though, it'd be nice if\nwe had some kind of starting point.\n\n43\n00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.980\nAnd Microsoft gives us\ntemplates to do that.\n\n44\n00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.530\nFor example, Ronnie, we're gonna\nstart this good old pet store and\n\n45\n00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.760\nwe need a sales invoice.\n\n46\n00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.850\nI need some way to bill my customers and\n\n47\n00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.960\nmy suppliers and things like that or\ngive them a receipt for an order.\n\n48\n00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.232\nWell, I could start from scratch.\n\n49\n00:02:44.232 --> 00:02:48.850\nI could design my own sales receipt,\nget everything done,\n\n50\n00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.000\nbut that might take me a while.\n\n51\n00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.640\nAnd I want to be able to start\nbilling people right now.\n\n52\n00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.140\nSo what I can do is I can use a template\nfrom Microsoft's online gallery.\n\n53\n00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.920\nI'm gonna back over here to File.\n\n54\n00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.712\nAnd I'm gonna close that blank workbook,\nand then File and New.\n\n55\n00:03:05.712 --> 00:03:09.988\nAnd instead of clicking blank workbook,\nI'm gonna choose a template.\n\n56\n00:03:09.988 --> 00:03:13.350\nNow on this start screen,\nthey give you a few different templates,\n\n57\n00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.030\nsome of the more common ones\nthat we might want to use.\n\n58\n00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.190\nIf none of those suits your needs,\nthere are thousands of templates online.\n\n59\n00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.430\nWe just need to find the one we want.\n\n60\n00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.630\nSo we'll simply type in our little\nsearch bar here, sales invoice.\n\n61\n00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:30.830\nHit enter.\n\n62\n00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.230\nLet it go out there and search.\n\n63\n00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.880\nYou can see searching\nthousands of online templates.\n\n64\n00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.570\nAnd what comes back is going to be\na whole bunch of sales invoice templates.\n\n65\n00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.410\nIn there, we got, I can see I have\nquite a few to scroll through.\n\n66\n00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.150\nAll right.\n\n67\n00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.890\nAnd then you just simply\npick the one you want.\n\n68\n00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.370\nYou find one you think might be right,\nyou click on it, and\n\n69\n00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.720\nyou can get a larger view of\nthat sales invoice template.\n\n70\n00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.690\nAnd if you decide that that's the one\nyou want, you can click Create.\n\n71\n00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.050\nOr you can start scrolling\nthrough some of the other ones,\n\n72\n00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.980\nsee if you can find a better one.\n\n73\n00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.270\nIf this is the one I like,\nI'll go ahead and click Create.\n\n74\n00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.510\nAnd what it's gonna do is it's\ngonna create a new workbook\n\n75\n00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.380\nbased off of that template.\n\n76\n00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.330\nAnd look, it's got everything\nall filled out already.\n\n77\n00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:21.570\nIt's got my place to put my company name,\nit's got my ship to address and\n\n78\n00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.890\nmy from address, has my information\nto put down my quantity, my items,\n\n79\n00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.970\nit's all formatted nice and pretty.\n\n80\n00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.390\nA place for totals, it even says,\nthank you for your business.\n\n81\n00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.190\nAnd I didn't have to do any of that.\n\n82\n00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.430\nAll I have to do now is go in and\nmodify some of this stuff.\n\n83\n00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.830\nI can come in here and replace that\ncompany name with my information.\n\n84\n00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.450\nWe'll say Mike's Pet Store.\n\n85\n00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.400\nFill out my slogan.\n\n86\n00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.700\nI can't think of a good slogan for\nmy pet store.\n\n87\n00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.942\nSo maybe we just don't use a slogan,\ninsert your logos, all that good stuff.\n\n88\n00:04:54.942 --> 00:04:59.010\nAnd so you can see that the power of the\ntemplates is it gives me a starting point.\n\n89\n00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.540\nI can use it just like it is and\n\n90\n00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.980\njust replace the information with my\ninformation, or maybe I just use this as\n\n91\n00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.140\na jumping-off point and\nmaybe I start making some changes to it.\n\n92\n00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.080\nMaybe we don't have customer ID, so\n\n93\n00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.242\nI start getting rid of\nsome of that information.\n\n94\n00:05:12.242 --> 00:05:16.800\nMaybe I don't like the color blue,\nso I wanna do this in orange or\n\n95\n00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.040\nsomething like that.\n\n96\n00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:23.200\nSo we can use that template as is or\nI can modify it to suit my needs.\n\n97\n00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.520\nAnd then what we would do, this is\nsomething that I wanna reuse, right?\n\n98\n00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.940\nAnd I don't wanna have to fill this\ninformation in every time, like,\n\n99\n00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.260\nMike's Pet Store.\n\n100\n00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.671\nSo, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nsave this but not as a workbook.\n\n101\n00:05:36.671 --> 00:05:38.754\nI'm actually gonna save it as a template.\n\n102\n00:05:38.754 --> 00:05:46.270\nSo I'm gonna go File, Save, and\nthen I'm going to click Browse.\n\n103\n00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.690\nAnd when I go to save it,\nI'm gonna change the Save As type\n\n104\n00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.880\nto Excel template and that's gonna\nchange where it's gonna save the file.\n\n105\n00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.710\nI would recommend you don't change this.\n\n106\n00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.390\nI'd let it put it where it wants,\nbecause when you launch Excel,\n\n107\n00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.620\nit's gonna look here for all the templates\nthat you've created or modified and\n\n108\n00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.240\nI want it to show up in that list.\n\n109\n00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.450\nI'll show you what I mean.\n\n110\n00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:14.990\nLet's change this to something like\n\n111\n00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:20.680\nMike's Pet Store Sales Invoice.\n\n112\n00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.950\nI'll, again, leave it in that location.\n\n113\n00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:23.630\nI'll click Save.\n\n114\n00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.310\nRight.\nNow, I'll close this file.\n\n115\n00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.932\nAnd when I go to create a new file,\ninstead of searching online for templates,\n\n116\n00:06:34.932 --> 00:06:36.713\nI'm gonna click Personal.\n\n117\n00:06:36.713 --> 00:06:39.730\nAnd there's my\nMike's Pet Store Sales Invoice.\n\n118\n00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:44.210\nI click it and it's already got\nmy information filled in, right?\n\n119\n00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:48.330\nSo that's the power of these templates,\nis you can use them as a starting point,\n\n120\n00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.050\nthey can contain information.\n\n121\n00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.010\nThe stuff that's gonna be in there every\ntime, I can save it in this template.\n\n122\n00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.530\nAnd then every time I need a new sales\ninvoice, I just make a new one based off\n\n123\n00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.080\nthat template, fill in this\nparticular customer's information and\n\n124\n00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.680\norder information, and we're good to go.\n\n125\n00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.590\n>> Now Mike,\nwhen we talk about using a template,\n\n126\n00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:09.100\nmost of the time when I take a look\nat them, like I'm kinda amazed about\n\n127\n00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.920\nhow the formatting works and\neverything else that's in there.\n\n128\n00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.161\nRemember that there's also formulas that\nare also in here that are pre-built that\n\n129\n00:07:15.161 --> 00:07:17.360\nactually give us the invoice\nthat we want to.\n\n130\n00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.840\nNow, the advantage of this, if you're\nlooking at it like, that doesn't look so\n\n131\n00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.440\namazing, you gotta realize\nwhat's actually happening.\n\n132\n00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.750\nIf Mike were to start this from scratch,\nright, he'd have to come up with\n\n133\n00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:29.310\nall the formatting and\nthen also build all those formulas and\n\n134\n00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.940\nactually format everything\nthe way that we need to.\n\n135\n00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.940\nAnd what this means is it\ntakes Mike a long time and\n\n136\n00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.050\nwe're starting from scratch before\nMike can ever even create an invoice.\n\n137\n00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:42.668\nBy using the templates that actually\nexist right here right now,\n\n138\n00:07:42.668 --> 00:07:44.922\nMike can simply do a few modifications.\n\n139\n00:07:44.922 --> 00:07:48.053\nBut what it give him the advantage to\nbe able to do if he's starting this pet\n\n140\n00:07:48.053 --> 00:07:50.832\nstore, somebody comes in and\ndecides they want to buy some pets,\n\n141\n00:07:50.832 --> 00:07:54.087\nis he immediately can pull this thing up,\nfill in the information he needs.\n\n142\n00:07:54.087 --> 00:07:58.613\nAnd he's actually working inside of Excel\nto create that invoice right away, without\n\n143\n00:07:58.613 --> 00:08:02.586\nMike ever having to actually figure\nout all those other advanced formulas.\n\n144\n00:08:02.586 --> 00:08:04.140\nOr even how he wants this to look.\n\n145\n00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:07.258\nIf it will work for him right away,\nthat's what we wanna do.\n\n146\n00:08:07.258 --> 00:08:10.714\nAnd that's the power of that template\nis to be able to get him to work\n\n147\n00:08:10.714 --> 00:08:14.544\nwith the data right away as quickly as\npossible without having to deal with\n\n148\n00:08:14.544 --> 00:08:17.530\nall the other extraneous\nthings that are also here.\n\n149\n00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:20.450\nSo it really is a powerful advantage\nto all of us if we need to get\n\n150\n00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:21.450\nstarted immediately.\n\n151\n00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:23.970\n>> Yeah, like I said,\nit's a great starting point.\n\n152\n00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.300\nIt saves me a whole lot of time.\n\n153\n00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:31.320\nI'm a pet store owner,\nI don't know how to create invoices and\n\n154\n00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:36.360\ngraphical design and what looks pretty and\nwhat colors to use and things like that.\n\n155\n00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.790\nSomebody else has already done that work.\n\n156\n00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:42.970\nI can go out there grab this template and\njust get started selling pets,\n\n157\n00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:44.049\ndoing what I do best.\n\n158\n00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.890\nAll right so we've got our templates.\n\n159\n00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:50.030\nNow the next thing we want to\ntake a look at is working with\n\n160\n00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.070\nwork sheets within our work books.\n\n161\n00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:56.900\nLike I said when you tart a brand\nnew workbook it has one sheet in it.\n\n162\n00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:00.740\nBut most of the time we end up\nwanting more than one sheet in there.\n\n163\n00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:05.540\nLet me close this guy and\nI'll go ahead and\n\n164\n00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:09.430\nsave that, since it's our nice,\nnow that's not an actual template.\n\n165\n00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:12.260\nSo I'm gonna put it back\nover in my documents.\n\n166\n00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.330\nNow I'll put it in Excel, and\nwe'll call it invoice one, that's fine for\n\n167\n00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:19.292\nour first customer.\n\n168\n00:09:19.292 --> 00:09:25.000\nAll right, now, I'm gonna open up\na spreadsheet that I made earlier,\n\n169\n00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:29.730\nand this is where we've I'm\nstarting to track our inventory or\n\n170\n00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:31.920\nthe things that we sell in our pet store.\n\n171\n00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.250\nSo you see how I have a tab for\ndogs, and I've got their breed and\n\n172\n00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:40.090\nwhat they cost us and what we're gonna\nsell them for, I've got miscellaneous,\n\n173\n00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:42.250\nsome hamsters and guinea pigs.\n\n174\n00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:44.970\nWe've got birds and we've got cats.\n\n175\n00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:48.340\nWell, now I want to\nstart selling reptiles.\n\n176\n00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:52.500\nSo that means I need somewhere to store\nthe information about the reptiles.\n\n177\n00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.890\nWhere do I do that?\n\n178\n00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:56.360\nThat's this little button right down here.\n\n179\n00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.500\nYou hover it, you see it says, New Sheet.\n\n180\n00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:05.770\nSo I can simply click that New Sheet\nbutton and now I have a new sheet.\n\n181\n00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:10.590\nNow, we can rename new sheets by\ndouble-clicking on the tab for\n\n182\n00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.490\nthe sheet itself and you can see the name.\n\n183\n00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:16.930\nNow sheet one is highlighted and\nI'll just start typing or\n\n184\n00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:18.149\nreplace that with Reptiles.\n\n185\n00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:23.240\nAll right, and now I've got a sheet\nwhere I can start tracking reptiles,\n\n186\n00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.050\nso adding a new sheet to\na workbook is simple.\n\n187\n00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:27.508\nYou just click the plus sign and\n\n188\n00:10:27.508 --> 00:10:32.180\nthen rename the sheet to whatever\nyou want that sheet to be called.\n\n189\n00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.340\nNow, we can also delete sheets.\n\n190\n00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.790\nMaybe we add a couple too many.\n\n191\n00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:38.620\nWe thought we were gonna need more.\n\n192\n00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.050\nAnd now we realize we don't need them, so\n\n193\n00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:43.366\nI've just got these blank worksheets in my\nworkbook and I want to get rid of them.\n\n194\n00:10:43.366 --> 00:10:45.013\nEasy enough.\n\n195\n00:10:45.013 --> 00:10:50.970\nRight-click on that tab and choose Delete,\nand that sheet will go away.\n\n196\n00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:52.570\nNow something to keep in mind.\n\n197\n00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:57.520\nIf this worksheet has data in it and\nyou go\n\n198\n00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:00.700\nto delete that worksheet,\nit will warn you.\n\n199\n00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:05.940\nIt will permanently delete this sheet and\nall data will be lost.\n\n200\n00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.332\nDo you wanna continue?\n\n201\n00:11:07.332 --> 00:11:11.390\nGives you that once chance,\nonce you click Delete, that's it.\n\n202\n00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:11.930\nIt's gone.\n\n203\n00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:12.590\nAll right.\n\n204\n00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:14.040\nDo be careful with that.\n\n205\n00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.640\nIf it's a blank sheet, no big deal.\n\n206\n00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.250\nI can always add another sheet.\n\n207\n00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:19.920\nBut if there was data on there,\nthat data's lost.\n\n208\n00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.090\nSo do be careful with the whole\ndeleting of the worksheets.\n\n209\n00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.460\nSo easy enough to add additional sheets.\n\n210\n00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.350\nAnd let's go ahead and let's see.\n\n211\n00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:31.270\nI'm going to fill some of this out.\n\n212\n00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:36.460\nAnd I'll show you guys some of\nthese tricks as we go through.\n\n213\n00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.060\nGood golly, Mike.\n\n214\n00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:41.130\nThere we go.\nWe're gonna go over here and put our\n\n215\n00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:48.160\nReptiles and let's say we want to sell\nboa constrictors and I don't know.\n\n216\n00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.880\nRonnie, do you have any idea\nwhat a boa constrictor goes for?\n\n217\n00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:51.508\n>> I really don't.\n\n218\n00:11:51.508 --> 00:11:55.851\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Let's say we got a $100,\n\n219\n00:11:55.851 --> 00:11:59.390\nthis thing cost us 100 and\nwe're gonna sell it for 150, and\n\n220\n00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:04.560\nI could continue to fill in data there but\nI won't bore you guys with my typing.\n\n221\n00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:08.210\nSo again just wanna make sure we see\nhow to add new sheets to workbooks.\n\n222\n00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:12.890\nYou might have a workbook where you're\ntracking sales, and you've got January.\n\n223\n00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:15.070\nMaybe you fill it out month by month.\n\n224\n00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:18.070\nSo this is December when\nwe're shooting this video.\n\n225\n00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:19.940\nI've got a tab for December sales.\n\n226\n00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:21.510\nWell, when January rolls around,\n\n227\n00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:24.690\nI don't want to put January\nsales on that same worksheet.\n\n228\n00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:28.790\nSo I simply add a new worksheet,\nname it January, start filling it in.\n\n229\n00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:31.760\nWhen February comes around\nwe add another worksheet.\n\n230\n00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.650\nAnd we fill in the information for\nFebruary on that one.\n\n231\n00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:37.830\nSo now I've got all of my sales in\none workbook that I can open up any\n\n232\n00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:38.830\ntime I want.\n\n233\n00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:41.660\nAnd it's organized by month and\nI can go to those different tabs.\n\n234\n00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:46.496\nSo new adding worksheets very common\nsomething that we're gonna need to be able\n\n235\n00:12:46.496 --> 00:12:48.817\nto do if we're gonna work with Excel.\n\n236\n00:12:48.817 --> 00:12:52.418\nAll right so another thing we need to be\nable to do with our work sheets is copy\n\n237\n00:12:52.418 --> 00:12:53.870\nthem and move them.\n\n238\n00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:56.890\nRather than insert a new\nsheet maybe I want\n\n239\n00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:00.130\nto I've got a sheet that's pretty close\nto what I want Instead of starting from\n\n240\n00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:03.670\nscratch I could just make a copy of it and\ntweak it a little bit.\n\n241\n00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:05.650\nFor example let's look at my screen here.\n\n242\n00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:08.020\nWe just created that sheet for reptiles.\n\n243\n00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:11.680\nNow I've decided we're going to\nstart carrying fish as well.\n\n244\n00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.060\nWell I've already got\nthis formatting done.\n\n245\n00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:17.970\nI could insert a new sheet and\nstart from scratch.\n\n246\n00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:21.510\nOr it could just copy this sheet and\nmodify it a little bit.\n\n247\n00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:27.560\nSimply right-click on that tab that I\nwanna copy, and choose Move or Copy.\n\n248\n00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.210\nNow when you open up this dialog box,\nyou got a few different options and\n\n249\n00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:32.420\nwe're gonna go over each one of these.\n\n250\n00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.840\nThe first things it says is To Book.\n\n251\n00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.710\nWell I want, remember they\nare talking about a workbook here.\n\n252\n00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:40.220\nI wanna make the copy\nin the same workbook so\n\n253\n00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.970\nI'm gonna leave that as is, animals.xlsx.\n\n254\n00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:46.980\nAnd then where do I wanna put it,\nbefore sheet.\n\n255\n00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:51.520\nSo whatever sheet I select and these are\nall the sheets that exist in this animals\n\n256\n00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:56.900\nworkbook, whichever one I select,\nit's gonna put it before that sheet.\n\n257\n00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:00.710\nSo if I select Dogs,\nwell Dogs is currently my first sheet,\n\n258\n00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:04.470\nthat would make a new sheet\nthat's copy the first worksheet.\n\n259\n00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:05.140\nAll right.\n\n260\n00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:09.490\nOr I can select move to end to put\nit the end of list of tabs there.\n\n261\n00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:12.570\nAnd then down at the bottom,\nthere's a very important option.\n\n262\n00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:18.030\nThis is Create a copy, cuz what it\nwants to do is move it by default.\n\n263\n00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:20.570\nSo if you don't check that,\nit's gonna move the worksheet.\n\n264\n00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:23.500\nNow in this case,\nmoving it from the animals workbook\n\n265\n00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.360\nto the animals workbook really\nwouldn't make a difference.\n\n266\n00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.070\nBut I could move it in order.\n\n267\n00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:30.910\nI could move the reptiles up to\nthe beginning of the worksheet or\n\n268\n00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:31.940\nsomething like that.\n\n269\n00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:36.070\nWe're gonna make a copy and\nput it at the end of the animals workbook.\n\n270\n00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:39.170\nI'll click OK, and\nnow I've got my Reptiles2.\n\n271\n00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:42.690\nAnd all I have to do at this point\nis double-click down on that tab,\n\n272\n00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:47.660\nlike I did earlier, rename it, we'll call\nit Fish, and now I can come up here and\n\n273\n00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:50.600\nmodify my info.\n\n274\n00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:56.180\nAnd angelfish probably don't cost $100,\nlet's say they cost me $15,\n\n275\n00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:00.280\nwhich means they're going\nto cost my customers $25.\n\n276\n00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.452\nWe got a good mark up on our fish there.\n\n277\n00:15:01.452 --> 00:15:02.254\nYeah.\n\n278\n00:15:02.254 --> 00:15:03.365\nAnd there we go.\n\n279\n00:15:03.365 --> 00:15:07.980\nAnd again this is a very simple example\nI had three little columns with some\n\n280\n00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:13.310\nblue background on one of those rows, but\nimagine a much more complex spreadsheet.\n\n281\n00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:17.180\nRather than starting from scratch and\ntrying to duplicate all that formulas, and\n\n282\n00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:22.120\nthose boxes, and the borders and things\nlike that, simply make a copy of the sheet\n\n283\n00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:27.120\nand then change your data, rename your\ntab and you're good to go, right?\n\n284\n00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:31.980\nSo that's copying a worksheet within\na workbook but we don't have to stop\n\n285\n00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:36.860\nthere we can actually copy and\nmove worksheets between workbooks.\n\n286\n00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.520\nRight.\nThe only thing you have to do is you have\n\n287\n00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:42.590\nto have the workbooks open to do this.\n\n288\n00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:47.620\nFor example, if I wanted to move this\nto a workbook, if I go right-click,\n\n289\n00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:52.330\nMove or Copy, and here's my drop down\nlist, only gives me two options.\n\n290\n00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:55.730\nThe existing workbook Animals and\nNew Book.\n\n291\n00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:56.714\nAnd maybe that's what I want.\n\n292\n00:15:56.714 --> 00:15:58.710\nMaybe I need to send this tab,\nand let's do a better tab.\n\n293\n00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:00.587\nWe'll do the dogs here.\n\n294\n00:16:00.587 --> 00:16:03.130\nMaybe I need to send this worksheet.\n\n295\n00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:04.040\nTo somebody else to work with.\n\n296\n00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:08.020\nI don't want to send them the entire\nworkbook with all these tabs.\n\n297\n00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:11.270\nI want this worksheet in its own workbook.\n\n298\n00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:11.915\nEasy enough.\n\n299\n00:16:11.915 --> 00:16:19.010\nRight-click on that tab, move or\ncopy, and choose new book, right?\n\n300\n00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:21.530\nAnd, now, important step here.\n\n301\n00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:26.050\nIf I don't choose create a copy,\nit will move the dog's worksheet\n\n302\n00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:29.330\nto the new workbook and it will no\nlonger be in my animals workbook,\n\n303\n00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:31.010\nand that's not what I want, right?\n\n304\n00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:33.640\nI need to keep it here,\nI wanna make a copy of it.\n\n305\n00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:37.574\nSo don't forget to choose\ncreate a copy and click okay.\n\n306\n00:16:37.574 --> 00:16:39.944\nAnd now I've got a new workbook,\n\n307\n00:16:39.944 --> 00:16:44.800\nthat has that Dogs spreadsheet in it,\nand I can simply save it.\n\n308\n00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:49.700\nWe'll do a little File > Save,\nwe'll go over to My Documents,\n\n309\n00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:55.120\nand we'll call this Dogs,\nand we'll save it.\n\n310\n00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:59.390\nAnd now I can send that off to whomever\nas an attachment, and we're good to go.\n\n311\n00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:02.750\nMy original workbook's still here,\nhasn't been changed.\n\n312\n00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:05.055\nSo copying it to a new workbook,\n\n313\n00:17:05.055 --> 00:17:10.040\nright-click on that tab, choose new\nworkbook from that drop-down list.\n\n314\n00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:13.490\n>> Now, Mike, when we take a look\nat working with Excel right away,\n\n315\n00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:18.010\njust from a blank workbook, itself, you\nshowed us when we create one just using\n\n316\n00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:21.463\nthat blank template,\nthat automatically gives us one worksheet.\n\n317\n00:17:21.463 --> 00:17:22.010\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n318\n00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:24.510\nwhat you actually showed\nus is multiple worksheets.\n\n319\n00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:27.440\nSo every time, if I actually wanted to do\nmore of those with multiple worksheets,\n\n320\n00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:31.070\nI have to actually just keep\npressing the plus sign.\n\n321\n00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:34.810\n>> That's a good question and\nno, you don't have to, right.\n\n322\n00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:38.610\nIf every time you open up a new workbook,\nyou know you need at least two tabs\n\n323\n00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:42.120\nbecause I've got one for my data and\none for a graph, or something like that.\n\n324\n00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:45.512\nOr every time you open up\na workbook you need five tabs.\n\n325\n00:17:45.512 --> 00:17:48.630\nWell, you could open up a blank\nworkbook with one sheet in it and\n\n326\n00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:52.700\nthen just click the plus sign four times,\nand you'd have five tabs, right?\n\n327\n00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:54.260\nBut that might get old.\n\n328\n00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.670\nSo you can change that with\nyour options in Excel.\n\n329\n00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:00.685\nYou can change what the defaults are for\nthose new workbooks.\n\n330\n00:18:00.685 --> 00:18:01.370\nLet's take a look at that.\n\n331\n00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:03.084\nI'm gonna close this workbook.\n\n332\n00:18:03.084 --> 00:18:08.150\nAnd I'll go ahead and save our changes\nwith our new reptiles in our Fish tab.\n\n333\n00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:11.370\nAnd then I'm gonna go File > Options.\n\n334\n00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:14.020\nThat opens up my Excel options,\nand there's dozens and\n\n335\n00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:15.570\ndozens of options in here.\n\n336\n00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:17.710\nBut the one we're looking at,\nright on that General tab,\n\n337\n00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:23.170\nthere's a section that says when creating\nnew workbooks, use these options here.\n\n338\n00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:27.850\nAnd this is why I get that calibri font,\nsize 11, with one worksheet in it.\n\n339\n00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:29.310\nWell, let's up that to three.\n\n340\n00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:33.210\nAll right, we'll go just change\nthat little number there, click OK.\n\n341\n00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:39.580\nAnd now, when I do File > New,\nand choose blank workbook,\n\n342\n00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:43.180\nI should get a workbook that starts\nwith three worksheets in it.\n\n343\n00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:46.590\n>> Nice.\n>> So very easy to change those defaults\n\n344\n00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:48.540\nand control how many sheets appear.\n\n345\n00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:50.660\nIf you go back to the old\nversions of Office,\n\n346\n00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:52.670\nthey would have actually\nstarted with three sheets, and\n\n347\n00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:56.790\nnow these newer versions only start\nwith one sheet in the workbook.\n\n348\n00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:59.320\nIf your feeling nostalgic,\nchange that back to three, or\n\n349\n00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.050\nif you find yourself adding more and\n\n350\n00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:04.550\nmore sheets every time you open up a new\nworkbook, change that option there.\n\n351\n00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:07.580\nThat way it'll already have\nall the sheets you need.\n\n352\n00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:09.660\nNow one other thing I wanna look at is,\nagain,\n\n353\n00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.400\nmoving those worksheets between workbooks.\n\n354\n00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:16.750\nI said the key there was to making\nsure that you had the workbooks open.\n\n355\n00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:20.801\nSo let me close this blank\nworkbook that we have here.\n\n356\n00:19:20.801 --> 00:19:23.041\nAll right, and I'm going to\nopen up a couple of workbooks.\n\n357\n00:19:23.041 --> 00:19:28.724\nI'm going to find my,\nlet me just browse over here,\n\n358\n00:19:28.724 --> 00:19:33.115\nand we're going to open up January, and\n\n359\n00:19:33.115 --> 00:19:38.541\nthen I'm gonna open up another one for\nFebruary,\n\n360\n00:19:38.541 --> 00:19:43.600\nand then I'm gonna open up one more for\nMarch.\n\n361\n00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:48.240\nSo I've got three separate workbooks, and\n\n362\n00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:51.240\nlet me just restore them down\nreal quick so you guys can tell.\n\n363\n00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:55.740\nAnd I've got three separate workbooks,\none for each month, which is great.\n\n364\n00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:59.510\nBut let's say I wanna have one workbook\nwith all those sheets in it so\n\n365\n00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:03.160\nthat I can just open up that one workbook,\nand I can click on the different tabs for\n\n366\n00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.270\neach month.\n\n367\n00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:06.420\nWell, instead of trying to recreate them,\n\n368\n00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:09.960\nI can simply go to one of those other\nworkbooks, let's go over to February.\n\n369\n00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:16.020\nAnd I'm gonna right-click on that tab for\nFebruary, and choose move or copy.\n\n370\n00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:20.810\nNow, this time I'm gonna\nchoose a different workbook.\n\n371\n00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:24.190\nAnd because I have those other ones open,\nnotice they show up in my list.\n\n372\n00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:26.720\nSo if you ever try to do this and\nthe workbook you wanna move it\n\n373\n00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:30.050\nto doesn't show up in your list, It's\nprobably because you don't have it open.\n\n374\n00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:33.010\nSo just make sure you open it,\nthen you can move to it.\n\n375\n00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:34.218\nSo I'll choose January.\n\n376\n00:20:34.218 --> 00:20:38.108\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and put it at\nthe end so it comes after January.\n\n377\n00:20:38.108 --> 00:20:43.240\nAnd I wanna create a copy because I still\nwant my individual sheet in this workbook.\n\n378\n00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:43.960\nAnd I'll click OK.\n\n379\n00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:48.465\nSo now you'll see I have\nthe January workbook open,\n\n380\n00:20:48.465 --> 00:20:52.650\nbut it has January and February in there.\n\n381\n00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:54.770\nNow, let's go over that March workbook.\n\n382\n00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.140\nRight-click on that tab.\n\n383\n00:20:58.670 --> 00:20:59.570\nMove or copy.\n\n384\n00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.870\nI'll choose that January workbook.\n\n385\n00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:04.990\nI'll put it at the end.\n\n386\n00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:10.980\nCreate a copy so\nI can keep my original, and click OK.\n\n387\n00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:16.260\nAnd now I've got one workbook\nthat has all three months in it.\n\n388\n00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:19.810\nNow what I wanna do here is\nI wanna make sure I save it.\n\n389\n00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:21.190\nSo I'm gonna ahead and do a File.\n\n390\n00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:26.150\nI'm gonna do a Save as cuz it's\nreally no longer just January, right?\n\n391\n00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:30.870\nSo I'll browse, I'll find my folder\nthat I want to keep everything in, and\n\n392\n00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:35.422\nI'll call this Quarter 1, 2015.\n\n393\n00:21:35.422 --> 00:21:38.980\nAnd we'll pick Save, and there you go.\n\n394\n00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:43.170\nNow I've got a workbook that has all three\nof those in there, and because I did\n\n395\n00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:50.510\na Save as, I still have my January\nworkbook with just January in it, right?\n\n396\n00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:53.004\nSo now I've got each month\nin its own workbook, and\n\n397\n00:21:53.004 --> 00:21:55.443\nI've got one workbook that\nhas all three months.\n\n398\n00:21:55.443 --> 00:21:58.212\nSo play around with those Move options and\nthose Copy options,\n\n399\n00:21:58.212 --> 00:21:59.425\nreally not too difficult.\n\n400\n00:21:59.425 --> 00:22:02.807\nJust right-click on the tab,\nchoose your destination workbook,\n\n401\n00:22:02.807 --> 00:22:05.850\ncheck that little check mark if\nyou don't plan on moving it.\n\n402\n00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:09.920\nIf you want to leave the original,\nyou gotta check that, make a copy.\n\n403\n00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:12.890\nAlso the other thing is,\nif it's the last sheet in the workbook,\n\n404\n00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:15.330\nit won't let you move it and\n\n405\n00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:20.010\nleave no worksheets in that workbook,\nthere has to be at least one sheet left.\n\n406\n00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:24.280\nIf you need to move the last sheet out\nof a workbook into another workbook,\n\n407\n00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.041\nthe trick is just create a new\nblank sheet real quick, right?\n\n408\n00:22:27.041 --> 00:22:28.870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Then you can move the one you want\n\n409\n00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:30.230\nto a different workbook and\n\n410\n00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:34.600\nit's okay with it because that last sheet\nis left in there even though it's blank.\n\n411\n00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.580\nAnd then you can just delete\nthat workbook when you're done.\n\n412\n00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:40.390\nSo easy enough to take multiple\nworkbooks and combine them, right?\n\n413\n00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:43.620\nYou might have different people\nworking on different workbooks, and\n\n414\n00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:47.340\nyou wanna put all those spreadsheets or\nall those worksheets in a single workbook.\n\n415\n00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:49.145\nEasy to do.\nJust make sure they're all open,\n\n416\n00:22:49.145 --> 00:22:52.340\nright-click, Move or Copy,\nand you're good to go.\n\n417\n00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:55.530\n>> Now, Mike, that's a lot of complicated\ninformation that we actually have\n\n418\n00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:56.240\nto worry about.\n\n419\n00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.833\nA lot of times at the very beginning,\n\n420\n00:22:57.833 --> 00:23:01.960\nright, we're just creating a simple blank\nworkbook, and that normally is gonna at\n\n421\n00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:05.690\nleast get us started to being\nable to use Excel right away.\n\n422\n00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:09.290\nBut remember that if we really need to get\nstarted, and we need to get it functioning\n\n423\n00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:13.280\nthe way that we want to, using\ntemplates is also another benefit for\n\n424\n00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:16.790\nus because it allows us not have\nto deal with how everything looks.\n\n425\n00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:19.560\nWe simply start entering\nin all our own information.\n\n426\n00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:22.430\nWe use that template,\nwe are actually now able to not\n\n427\n00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:25.980\nworry about all the other stuff here and\njust start entering in our data.\n\n428\n00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:29.220\nBut also, right, if you have\nexisting data somewhere else and\n\n429\n00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.070\nyou now need to consolidate it or\n\n430\n00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:35.900\nyou need to actually be able to move\nthem around to different locations,\n\n431\n00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:39.240\nwhether their actually within the same\nworkbook or in different workbooks,\n\n432\n00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.820\nwe can also take our existing data\ninside of Excel and do that as well.\n\n433\n00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:44.370\nAnd you may do that more\noften than you think.\n\n434\n00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:48.250\nEven though we're describing it in\nvery basic terms here right now,\n\n435\n00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:51.310\na lot of times we may have actually\nhad data that existed before,\n\n436\n00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:55.404\nlet's say even in previous editions of\nExcel, that we now need to bring into our\n\n437\n00:23:55.404 --> 00:23:59.360\ncurrent edition of Excel, and that's\nwhere we might also do that as well.\n\n438\n00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.870\nSo taking a look at workbooks and\n\n439\n00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:03.800\nworksheets, can it be\ncomplicated at times?\n\n440\n00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.550\nYes, but is it something that we\ndefinitely need to know how to do?\n\n441\n00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:08.230\nYou better believe it, right?\n\n442\n00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:11.900\nAnd this actually makes for us being able\nto work more effectively, especially with\n\n443\n00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:15.530\nmultiple workbooks, and especially with\nmultiple worksheets at the same time.\n\n444\n00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:18.403\nSo thank you, Mike, for actually showing\nus all those different ways that we can\n\n445\n00:24:18.403 --> 00:24:20.120\nwork with workbooks and worksheets.\n\n446\n00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.120\nThank you also for watching.\n\n447\n00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:25.360\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n448\n00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:26.250\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n449\n00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:27.275\n>> And we'll see you next

00:00:17.310\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n4\n00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.060\ntoday we're gonna be taking a look\nat Microsoft Office Excel 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.280\nAnd we're specifically gonna be\ndealing with well navigation more than\n\n6\n00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.200\nanything else.\n\n7\n00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.000\nAnd you might find that a strange topic,\nbut\n\n8\n00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.580\nhere to help us out is\ngonna be Mr Mike Rodrick.\n\n9\n00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.930\nMike how are you doing today?\n\n10\n00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.440\n>> Doing great, Ronnie, glad to be here.\n\n11\n00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.440\nAnd you're right we're gonna\ncontinue on with Excel.\n\n12\n00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.940\nFirst thing we really wanna take a look\nat is as we start working with larger\n\n13\n00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.110\ndatasets, those navigation\ntechniques really become important.\n\n14\n00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.160\nBeing able to work my way\naround that document,\n\n15\n00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.000\nfind what it is that I'm looking for, for\nexample, jump to particular spots within\n\n16\n00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.520\nthat document, all of that becomes key\nto really making us more productive and\n\n17\n00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.300\nmore efficient working with\nthose larger documents.\n\n18\n00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.020\nSo I've got a document here on my\nscreen that has quite a few rows.\n\n19\n00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:11.650\nIf we jump down somewhere around\n3,000 rows or something like that.\n\n20\n00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.000\nSo as you can see, I can scroll, right?\n\n21\n00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.760\nAnd I can work my way through there.\n\n22\n00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.870\nBut let's say I'm looking for\na particular value or a particular item.\n\n23\n00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:25.570\nIf I start scrolling through here, I could\nprobably eventually find it, right, maybe.\n\n24\n00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.300\nI might miss it and\nget all the way to the end and\n\n25\n00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.350\ngo crud and now have to go back up\nthrough it and try it again, right.\n\n26\n00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.450\nThere are tools within Excel.\n\n27\n00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.810\nWe don't have to do that, right?\n\n28\n00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.400\nFirst one I wanna show you is right\nover here on the home ribbon.\n\n29\n00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.732\nIs this Find & Select, all right.\n\n30\n00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:43.890\nSo, I'm gonna go and click on that and\nit's gonna open up a little dropdown list.\n\n31\n00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.960\nAnd I'm just gonna choose Find.\n\n32\n00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.145\nAnd let's say I'm looking for, I know that\none of the products that we sell is called\n\n33\n00:01:50.145 --> 00:01:54.040\ntricor, so I wanna see if anybody\nhas purchased any of this tricor.\n\n34\n00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.310\nSo I'm simply gonna type in tricor and\nthen click Find Next.\n\n35\n00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.730\nAnd notice it does two things,\nit finds it and it also selects that cell.\n\n36\n00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.630\nSo my active cell, this green border\nindicating the active cell, is now tricor.\n\n37\n00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.920\nIf I want to see if there is more of\nthose, I can click Find Next again, and\n\n38\n00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.500\nnow I'm down to row 243.\n\n39\n00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.880\nIt found another instance of that word.\n\n40\n00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.150\nNow the Find has a few options.\n\n41\n00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.190\nThere's just your basic type it in,\nclick Find Next, and you're good to go.\n\n42\n00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.780\nYou could also do Find All.\n\n43\n00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.450\nAnd what happens is, it opens up\nthis little or expands this window.\n\n44\n00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.990\nAnd now I can see every\ninstance of Tricor.\n\n45\n00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.380\nWithout having to go next,\nnext, next, next, next,\n\n46\n00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.520\nI could jump right to the last\ninstance by clicking on that and\n\n47\n00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.680\nit takes me right to that cell\ndown that row 2799 for Tricor.\n\n48\n00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.460\nSo I like the Find All.\n\n49\n00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.890\nYou can also do some options in here.\n\n50\n00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.450\nIf I click Options with my find you'll see\na few options that might come in handy\n\n51\n00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.813\nwhen you're searching for something.\n\n52\n00:02:58.813 --> 00:03:02.950\nAll right let's zoom in here and\ntake a look [COUGH].\n\n53\n00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.680\nI typed in Tricor as what I was\nlooking for within Sheet, so\n\n54\n00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.710\nit's just looking in this one worksheet.\n\n55\n00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.210\nWhat if this workbook had\nseveral worksheets and\n\n56\n00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.050\nI wanted to find instances across\nall those different worksheets?\n\n57\n00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.350\nI could change that to workbook.\n\n58\n00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.960\nIt normally searches by rows,\n\n59\n00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.690\nmeaning that it's going taking this row,\nsearching all the columns.\n\n60\n00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.700\nThen going to the next row,\ngoing through each column, and\n\n61\n00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.210\nthen the next row, and so on.\n\n62\n00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.710\nYou might find it more efficient like\nif you know they're all in one column,\n\n63\n00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.060\nyou could change this to by columns, and\nit might make it a little more efficient.\n\n64\n00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.200\nNow with 3,000 rows, that might seem like\na lot to us, to Excel, that's nothing.\n\n65\n00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.690\nI mean, it goes up to 16 million\nplus rows, almost 17 million rows.\n\n66\n00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.900\nSo, 3,000 rows is not a lot.\n\n67\n00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.010\nBut it might be more efficient if you've\ngot a super large data set to change that\n\n68\n00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.829\nto search, By columns.\n\n69\n00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:55.920\nLook in Formulas.\n\n70\n00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.540\nWhat if the word I was looking for\nwas like sum.\n\n71\n00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.800\nAnd I wanted to see if there were\nany formulas in the spreadsheet\n\n72\n00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.250\nthat had the word sum in it, right?\n\n73\n00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.960\nI could search Formulas,\nor I could search Values.\n\n74\n00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.025\nSo, if the word sum was in the formula,\nit wouldn't find that.\n\n75\n00:04:09.025 --> 00:04:11.040\nCuz now it's only looking at\nthe output of the format,\n\n76\n00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.140\nthe actual value that's in the cell,\nor comments.\n\n77\n00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.010\nIf people have created comments,\nif you're collaborating.\n\n78\n00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.840\nYou can search for a particular comment or\nI can search for Ronnie's name,\n\n79\n00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.910\nmaybe every time we make a comment\nit puts our name in there.\n\n80\n00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.660\nI can search for comments done by Ronnie.\n\n81\n00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.770\nSo a few different options\nto tweak your search there.\n\n82\n00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.880\nAs well as Match case and\nMatch entire contents.\n\n83\n00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.510\nNow I typed in tricor with a lower case t.\n\n84\n00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.720\nIt doesn't have Match case, so\nit found the ones even with a capital T.\n\n85\n00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.850\nIf I choose Match case and\n\n86\n00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:47.130\nthen Find All, it says we couldn't\nfind what you were looking for, right?\n\n87\n00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.780\nWell I know tricor's out there,\nwe just saw it.\n\n88\n00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.260\nBut it's not spelled with a lowercase t.\n\n89\n00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.290\nSo maybe you're looking for\nall the miss-types.\n\n90\n00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.600\nWhere somebody put in mister but\nused a lower case m or\n\n91\n00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.800\nthe word Florida with a lowercase f.\n\n92\n00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.910\nI can do a search for\nFlorida with a lowercase f, match case and\n\n93\n00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.810\nit would ignore all the ones that have the\nproper capital F for the word Florida, but\n\n94\n00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.810\nit would find all the ones that didn't.\n\n95\n00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.200\nSo use these to your advantage.\n\n96\n00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.430\nEntire contents,\nif I search for tricor, what if\n\n97\n00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:23.280\nthere's one that says trichlorophoroploro\nsomething, right, some big crazy name.\n\n98\n00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.254\nWell, match entire contents, it wouldn't\ntake, it wouldn't find that one.\n\n99\n00:05:27.254 --> 00:05:30.260\nRight, because Tricor is only\npart of the cell contents.\n\n100\n00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.370\nSo you just have to decide is it looking\nfor just part, as long as it's in\n\n101\n00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.230\nthe cell, somewhere in there, or does it\nhave to match everything in that cell?\n\n102\n00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.280\nSo a few different option you can\nuse with the Find and Replace.\n\n103\n00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.100\nAgain just trying to make it easier for\n\n104\n00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.070\nus to jump around within this document\nwhen we've got large datasets.\n\n105\n00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.170\nAnother cool thing,\n\n106\n00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.090\nanother way we can jump around, and\nlet me scroll back up to the top here.\n\n107\n00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.620\nLet me just grab this guy and\ndrag it up that'll be a little quicker.\n\n108\n00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.980\nIs this box right over here,\nis known as the Name Box.\n\n109\n00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.194\nIf I scroll into this and take a closer\nlook see when I hover over it,\n\n110\n00:06:06.194 --> 00:06:07.488\nthis says Name Box.\n\n111\n00:06:07.488 --> 00:06:10.321\nAnd you can see in there it says C2799.\n\n112\n00:06:10.321 --> 00:06:14.260\nWell, that's actually the cell\nthat I currently have selected.\n\n113\n00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.530\nIf I click on one of these other cells,\n\n114\n00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.900\nyou'll see it changes to B4\ncuz I have cell B4 selected.\n\n115\n00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.820\nSo the first thing the Name Box says\nis tell you where your active cell\n\n116\n00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.260\ncurrently resides.\n\n117\n00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.440\nYou can also use this to\njump to a particular cell.\n\n118\n00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.870\nWhat if I wanted to go to C2000,\n\n119\n00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.970\nI want to go all the way down\nto the row 2000 column C.\n\n120\n00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:36.450\nI just type it in there hit Enter and\nthere you go.\n\n121\n00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:41.210\nAll right, I'm now at, if I can find\nit there, there's my active cell,\n\n122\n00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.270\nrow 2000 column C.\n\n123\n00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:48.340\nNow that Name Box does some other\ncool things that we're gonna save for\n\n124\n00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.230\na later episode, if you hang on\nthe edge of your seat for that one.\n\n125\n00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:53.570\nBut in its basic sense,\n\n126\n00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.400\nthe Name Box tells you the name of\nthe cell that you currently have selected.\n\n127\n00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.210\nAnd in Excel,\neverything is about column, row, right?\n\n128\n00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:03.088\nOur spreadsheets are organized\nin columns of information.\n\n129\n00:07:03.088 --> 00:07:09.070\nThose are designated with letters,\nA, B, C, D, all the way out to Z.\n\n130\n00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:16.040\nAnd if we get out to Z, it starts over AA,\nAB, AC, it goes all the way out to AZ.\n\n131\n00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.367\nAnd then the next column is gonna be BA,\nBB, BC.\n\n132\n00:07:19.367 --> 00:07:22.094\nAnd it just keeps incrementing and\n\n133\n00:07:22.094 --> 00:07:26.240\nwhen it gets to ZZ it goes to AAA,\nAAB, AAC, right?\n\n134\n00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.577\nIt just keeps going.\n\n135\n00:07:27.577 --> 00:07:32.390\n[COUGH] There are 65,000 columns,\nI believe, you can have in Excel 2016.\n\n136\n00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:36.975\n>> It normally ends at UFD,\nhowever many that is, that's all I know.\n\n137\n00:07:36.975 --> 00:07:38.650\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's way out there, right?\n\n138\n00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:40.100\n>> Yeah.\n>> Hopefully you're not working with data\n\n139\n00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.910\nsets quite that large.\n\n140\n00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:43.350\nRows, yes, maybe not columns.\n\n141\n00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:46.140\nAnd a lot of times if I see\na spreadsheet like that I'm like,\n\n142\n00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.960\nthis should probably be broken up\ninto more than one spreadsheet.\n\n143\n00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.640\nBut that's another story.\n\n144\n00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.120\nAll right, so\nwe've got our searching for data.\n\n145\n00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.800\nWe can use that find option.\n\n146\n00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.905\nLet's see if my keyboard\nshortcut is going to work.\n\n147\n00:07:56.905 --> 00:07:59.650\nCtrl+F is the keyboard shortcut for that.\n\n148\n00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:03.150\nYou can see it brings up that\nFind dialog box as well.\n\n149\n00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:06.130\nWe also saw the Name Box,\nwhat else we got?\n\n150\n00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:10.790\nOoh, hyperlinks, another great\nway to navigate around documents.\n\n151\n00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:13.280\nLet's look at some of the cool\nthings I can do with hyperlinks.\n\n152\n00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.990\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nclose that particular workbook and\n\n153\n00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:18.350\nI'm gonna open up one.\n\n154\n00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:24.033\nLet's see which one I wanna use,\nI wanna use this customers.\n\n155\n00:08:24.033 --> 00:08:26.700\nYeah that'd be a good way to do that,\nyeah let's use customers.\n\n156\n00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:30.550\nAll right, so\nlet me go open up another spreadsheet.\n\n157\n00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:38.090\nWe'll find customers, all right.\n\n158\n00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:40.640\nAnd here I've got a list of just\nmy customers that we deal with.\n\n159\n00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:46.060\nSo we distribute pharmaceuticals to\nthese different hospitals in the area.\n\n160\n00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.840\nOne thing I could do is\nI can insert hyperlinks.\n\n161\n00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.990\nNow think well why?\n\n162\n00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:52.970\nWhat's the point of putting\na hyperlink in a spreadsheet?\n\n163\n00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:54.600\nThere's actually some pretty\ncool things you can do.\n\n164\n00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.780\nI'm gonna go to my Insert ribbon.\n\n165\n00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.410\nAnd then, over here I've got Hyperlink.\n\n166\n00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:01.940\nI'm gonna go ahead and click on that.\n\n167\n00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:05.900\nIn fact, let's do this,\nif I have a blank cell selected and\n\n168\n00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.900\nI do Hyperlink, It starts me\nout with this blank dialog box.\n\n169\n00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.360\nWith the Insert Hyperlink there's\na few things that you need to do.\n\n170\n00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.230\nYou need to put Text to Display,\nwhat's it actually gonna put in the cell.\n\n171\n00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:19.600\nIn other words,\nwhat's gonna be displayed in that cell.\n\n172\n00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.740\nDown at the bottom, the actual address.\n\n173\n00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.350\nWhere if I click on this hyperlink,\n\n174\n00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:28.650\nwe know a hyperlink js a link\nto another place, right?\n\n175\n00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:31.250\nTypically we see this in webpages.\n\n176\n00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:32.455\nSo where is it going to take me?\n\n177\n00:09:32.455 --> 00:09:34.780\nWhat is the address that\nit's going to take me?\n\n178\n00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:39.050\nAnd then over in the side, in my Places\nbar, I have Link to: Existing File or\n\n179\n00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:45.280\nWebpage, Place in this Document,\nCreate New Document or Email Address.\n\n180\n00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:49.540\nWe'll just start at the beginning here,\nExisting File or Web Page.\n\n181\n00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.870\nAnd what I'm gonna do Is I'm\nactually going to browse.\n\n182\n00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:57.720\nYou can see I've got Current Folder,\nBrowse Pages, Recent Files.\n\n183\n00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.460\nWell what Im gonna do is I'm\ngonna zoom back out for a second.\n\n184\n00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:03.240\nOpen up my browser and\n\n185\n00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:09.040\nlet's go to Florida hospital Tampa.\n\n186\n00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.880\nNot the shooting that occurred there,\nevidently.\n\n187\n00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.530\nAnd let's see if I can find their\nactual website, here we go.\n\n188\n00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:21.270\nSo here's their webpage.\n\n189\n00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:25.830\nSo I want to select that URL,\nand I'm gonna just copy it.\n\n190\n00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:27.720\nThen I'm gonna jump back over to Excel.\n\n191\n00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.610\nAnd you'll see something interesting\nhappen over here in Excel.\n\n192\n00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:33.980\nYou saw me browsing with\nthis hyperlink thing open.\n\n193\n00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:34.790\nAnd you see what it did.\n\n194\n00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.890\nIt filled in some text.\n\n195\n00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:39.500\nThat's pulled from their webpage.\n\n196\n00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.070\nThe title of the page and\nthe actual address.\n\n197\n00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:44.710\nNow, if it hadn't filled that in for me,\n\n198\n00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:46.870\nI could obviously type\nwhatever I wanted there.\n\n199\n00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:48.920\nI could paste in that URL.\n\n200\n00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.710\nIf I had browsed to that page in the past,\nI could do browse pages and\n\n201\n00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:55.600\nit actually shows me my\nhistory from my browser.\n\n202\n00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.270\nI'll go ahead and click OK.\n\n203\n00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:00.856\nLet's change this actually,\nlet's make that a little bit shorter.\n\n204\n00:11:03.653 --> 00:11:04.770\nNow we'll click OK.\n\n205\n00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:09.184\nWe'll zoom back out and\nthere's my hyperlink.\n\n206\n00:11:09.184 --> 00:11:14.629\nAnd let's close the browser, just so\nI can prove that it's actually working.\n\n207\n00:11:14.629 --> 00:11:16.081\nAll right, I'll go ahead and click.\n\n208\n00:11:16.081 --> 00:11:18.940\nYou notice when I hover over it,\nall right?\n\n209\n00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:22.060\nI get that little hand icon which is,\nwe're use to that.\n\n210\n00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:26.700\nI click on it,\nthen sure enough there's that web page.\n\n211\n00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:30.540\nSo may be you've gotta workbook or you've\ngot a list of all your customers and\n\n212\n00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:35.370\nyou wanna be able to quickly jump out\nto a webpage that the customer has\n\n213\n00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:38.510\nto get more information about\nthe customer or something like that.\n\n214\n00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:40.600\nAny number of reasons you\nmight want to jump out.\n\n215\n00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:44.630\nLike I've had a spreadsheet\nthat had products listed in it.\n\n216\n00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:48.590\nAnd then we had a web server that hosted\ndetailed descriptions of the products and\n\n217\n00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:50.720\neven images in a web page.\n\n218\n00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:54.400\nAnd so what I did in my workbook is I\nhad the name of the product was actually\n\n219\n00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:54.900\na hyperlink.\n\n220\n00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.890\nAnd if you clicked on it,\nit would take you to that web page.\n\n221\n00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:01.140\nSo if I got a salesperson on the phone\ntrying to sell this product and\n\n222\n00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.670\nthey're trying to explain to\nthe customer why they need this product,\n\n223\n00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:05.060\nexplain about the product.\n\n224\n00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:08.170\nThey can simply click on that product,\nget more information right\n\n225\n00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.380\nthere at their fingertips, so\nthey can continue that phone call and\n\n226\n00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:13.490\nhopefully, successfully sell that product,\nright?\n\n227\n00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:15.850\nSo, different reasons you\nmight use hyperlinks.\n\n228\n00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:20.180\nAnother cool thing is, if I select this\ncell that already has text in it and\n\n229\n00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.180\ndo hyperlink, all right.\n\n230\n00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:25.950\nIt takes the text that's in the cell and\nuses that as text to display.\n\n231\n00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:30.800\nSo now I could just paste that link in\nthere and click OK and nothing really\n\n232\n00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.120\nchanges except for the format that it\nstill says Florida Hospital Tampa,\n\n233\n00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.480\nstill takes me right out to that webpage,\nso.\n\n234\n00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:41.640\nOne use of hyperlinks is to jump\nto a webpage, which is what we\n\n235\n00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:45.080\nusually think about with hyperlinks,\nis going to somewhere out on the Internet.\n\n236\n00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:48.640\nBut that's not the only\nthing we can do with those.\n\n237\n00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:52.480\nLet me open up another workbook, and\n\n238\n00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:56.930\nlet's do, we'll take a look at orders,\nall right?\n\n239\n00:12:56.930 --> 00:13:01.580\nNow, maybe here I wanna be able\nto look at this order sheet,\n\n240\n00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:07.016\nand I see that Memorial Hospital\nordered this particular product.\n\n241\n00:13:07.016 --> 00:13:09.591\nAnd I wanna be,\nmy sales rep needs to be able to say, ooh,\n\n242\n00:13:09.591 --> 00:13:12.079\nI need to contact them and\nsee if they need more of that.\n\n243\n00:13:12.079 --> 00:13:14.692\nOr I can sell them anything else or\nsomething that goes with it, or\n\n244\n00:13:14.692 --> 00:13:17.820\nmaybe there's a warning that came\nout with it, or who knows what.\n\n245\n00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:21.280\nWell I've got their contact\ninformation in that other workbook.\n\n246\n00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.868\nSo now they have to go and\nopen up that other workbook.\n\n247\n00:13:22.868 --> 00:13:25.030\nNo they don't, right?\n\n248\n00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:28.820\nLet's take a look,\nwhat we can do is insert hyperlink, so\n\n249\n00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:32.410\nI'll go back to my insert and hyperlink.\n\n250\n00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:37.300\nAnd this time I'm gonna say, it's\nthe same option existing file or webpage.\n\n251\n00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:42.880\nAnd I'm gonna grab, instead of a URL for a\nwebpage, Customers.xlsx, that spreadsheet.\n\n252\n00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:46.690\nI'll click OK, and\nlet me close that workbook so\n\n253\n00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:48.530\nI can prove to you that it works.\n\n254\n00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.950\nAnd yeah, let's save it, it is pretty.\n\n255\n00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:54.620\nSo now they can be looking at the orders,\nthey can say,\n\n256\n00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:57.650\nI need to contact these guys,\nI can click on Memorial Hospital.\n\n257\n00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:00.190\nAnd actually opens up my\ncustomer spreadsheet.\n\n258\n00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:02.820\nAnd then I can click on\nthat hospital's name.\n\n259\n00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.180\nI didn't do Memorial Hospital.\n\n260\n00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:05.720\nBut I can maybe jump to their webpage, or\n\n261\n00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.430\nat least I can get their\ncontact information.\n\n262\n00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.190\nAnd I can give them a call, all right.\n\n263\n00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:14.750\nSo really cool I think, being able to\nput a hyperlink in one spreadsheet that\n\n264\n00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:17.360\ntakes you to another complete workbook,\nright?\n\n265\n00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:22.530\nAnother one we can do is\nanother place in the document.\n\n266\n00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:25.040\nAnd you might think, what the heck?\n\n267\n00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:28.160\nWell, let's open up that big\nold spreadsheet again, Orders.\n\n268\n00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.980\nActually, I already got it opened don't I?\n\n269\n00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:33.648\nOops, so let's go over here to orders.\n\n270\n00:14:33.648 --> 00:14:37.840\nRemember, this is that one that has,\nI don't know, 3000 some odd rows.\n\n271\n00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.820\nLet's say I've taken my time and\nI've scrolled through all of these guys.\n\n272\n00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.970\nNow I gotta scroll back up.\n\n273\n00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:45.060\nYeah, not really.\n\n274\n00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:49.140\nI can come over here and\nlet's just do, Back to Top.\n\n275\n00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:53.740\nI click it, nothing happens.\n\n276\n00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:58.321\nSo, let's do a hyperlink and\nplace in this document and A1.\n\n277\n00:14:58.321 --> 00:15:02.348\nI know cell A1 is the top,\nI'll select cell A1.\n\n278\n00:15:02.348 --> 00:15:06.090\nI've already got my text to display\nbecause that was in the cell.\n\n279\n00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:10.810\nI click okay and now it looks like\na hyperlink and I click on it and\n\n280\n00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:12.590\nit takes me right back up to the top.\n\n281\n00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:16.400\nThis is extremely handy, you might\nhave a long spreadsheet like this,\n\n282\n00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.440\nand what if there was a totals\nrow down at the bottom.\n\n283\n00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.850\nLet's do that Ronnie,\nlet's go back down here.\n\n284\n00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:33.140\nAnd say down here there was a, we'll\npretend that this is my Totals row, right.\n\n285\n00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.520\nAnd when I open this up a lot of\ntime I just need to see the totals.\n\n286\n00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:36.930\nI don't care how many rows there are,\n\n287\n00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:40.170\nthe details,\nI want to go down to the Totals row.\n\n288\n00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:43.497\nWell, all I have to do is\nknow what cell that is A3002.\n\n289\n00:15:43.497 --> 00:15:48.660\nSo I can go, oops, you know what,\nI forgot that I had my handy link already,\n\n290\n00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:51.019\n[LAUGH] let's jump back to the top.\n\n291\n00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:55.330\nAll right, and go over here, and\nI'll just put the word totals.\n\n292\n00:15:56.770 --> 00:16:01.015\nAnd then I'll turn that into a hyperlink,\nand uh-oh, 3002.\n\n293\n00:16:01.015 --> 00:16:03.050\n>> I think that's what you said.\n\n294\n00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:08.320\n>> Something like that, we'll click OK,\nand we'll click Totals and\n\n295\n00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:11.240\nboom, it takes me right\nthere to that Totals row.\n\n296\n00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.170\nSo you get the idea.\n\n297\n00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:16.640\nI can jump anywhere within this worksheet\nto another spot in another worksheet in\n\n298\n00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:21.980\nthis workbook to another separate\nworkbook to a URL to a webpage.\n\n299\n00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.930\nI can even create a blank workbook.\n\n300\n00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:27.930\nMaybe you've got that template for\npurchase orders created.\n\n301\n00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:30.930\nAnd when they're sitting there\nlooking at customers you wanna link\n\n302\n00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:33.760\nin the spreadsheet that\nsays create new workbook.\n\n303\n00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:37.100\nWhy, I don't know you could\nFile > New just as easy right?\n\n304\n00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.910\nBut you get the idea.\n\n305\n00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:43.730\nEmail is another one, I don't have email\nclient set up on this particular computer,\n\n306\n00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:47.130\nbut there was also an email option\nwhen we do hyperlinks, right?\n\n307\n00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:52.240\nEmail address, so I can basically create I\ncan put a cell down there that said, hey,\n\n308\n00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.240\nif you need more information contact me.\n\n309\n00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.710\nTurn it into a link.\n\n310\n00:16:55.710 --> 00:17:00.080\nWhen they click on it it opens up their\nemail application with my email address\n\n311\n00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.190\nalready in the To field, right?\n\n312\n00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:04.030\nOr for customer support.\n\n313\n00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:06.220\nSo you can see the kind of things\nI might be able to do with that.\n\n314\n00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.250\nJust get creative with those hyperlinks.\n\n315\n00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:11.300\nLove, love, love,\nthe ability to do hyperlinks.\n\n316\n00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:16.330\nRonnie, a few different ways that we can\nnavigate around those large datasets.\n\n317\n00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:17.550\n>> And now Mike,\n\n318\n00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:22.070\nwith using this, the key here is more\nproductivity than anything else.\n\n319\n00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:24.030\nYou may not use all of them,\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n320\n00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:27.318\nYou can spend 20,\n30 minutes adding in all this stuff.\n\n321\n00:17:27.318 --> 00:17:30.730\nBut it doesn't make you more\nproductive if you won't at least try.\n\n322\n00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:33.890\nSo knowing how to actually get this stuff\ndone really is going to give you a key,\n\n323\n00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:36.870\nespecially when you're working\nwith 3,000 rows of data.\n\n324\n00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:38.810\nRemember, what ends up\nhappening with the data right,\n\n325\n00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:42.250\nis that every row when you\nscroll past a couple hundred,\n\n326\n00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:46.070\n300 to a 1,000 it all begins\nto look exactly the same.\n\n327\n00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:46.581\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n328\n00:17:46.581 --> 00:17:50.830\nusing these tools to your advantage\nwill make you more productive.\n\n329\n00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:53.570\nIt will also give you more\nconfidence in doing this.\n\n330\n00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:57.710\nAnd so Mike, we emphasize the idea of\npractice more than anything else, and\n\n331\n00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:00.280\nthat's about as important as we\ncan actually tell people, right?\n\n332\n00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:03.260\n>> Absolutely, you've gotta practice,\nyou gotta get comfortable\n\n333\n00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.510\nusing the technology so\nthat it doesn't stand in your way.\n\n334\n00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:09.480\nYou want the technology to help you,\nnot hold you back.\n\n335\n00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.990\n>> All right, so that's the way that we\ncan actually take a look at the basic\n\n336\n00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:17.410\ntools that we can use to help us navigate\naround our data inside of Excel.\n\n337\n00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:21.790\nMake sure you do take the time to practice\nthem, and get familiar with them because\n\n338\n00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:24.670\nit is really gonna help you out as\nyou continue to progress more and\n\n339\n00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:27.080\nmore in your skills in Excel as well.\n\n340\n00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.080\n>> I was gonna say we'll make sure we put\nthese spreadsheets up there on the site as\n\n341\n00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.920\nwell, so if you guys need some larger\ndata sets to play with you've got\n\n342\n00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:33.950\nsomething to work with.\n\n343\n00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:34.880\n>> Excellent.\n\n344\n00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.830\nAll right, so signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n345\n00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:39.660\n>> And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n346\n00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.739\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n347\n00:18:41.739 --> 00:18:44.629\n[SOUND]\n\n",

Data must be presented in a manner that will help to make the point with our data the way we need, according to the guys.  Mike demonstrates how to make the worksheets look better through adjusting the page setup, adjusting the column or row height to make it more effective and adding in additional rows when data is already present.  These techniques are key to formatting data for presentation as well productivity.",

00:00:17.280\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.280\ntoday we're gonna be taking\na look at Microsoft Excel 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.020\nNow what we're talking about today\nthough is formatting worksheets and\n\n6\n00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.520\nthe reason why we need to mention\nthat is that the data that we have\n\n7\n00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.820\ninside of our work books that\nwe really need to deal with,\n\n8\n00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.000\na lot of times that data's gonna need\nto be presented to somebody else.\n\n9\n00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.600\nAnd to present that to somebody else\nwe need to put it into an appeasing\n\n10\n00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.580\ntype of format for us.\n\n11\n00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.150\nAnd here to help us to learn how to\nformat our worksheets Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n12\n00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.460\nMike, how's it going?\n\n13\n00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.310\n>> It's going great Ronnie.\n\n14\n00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.000\nExcited to be here,\nexcited to be playing with Excel and\n\n15\n00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.020\nhoping that we can appease the people\nthat we are sharing our data with.\n\n16\n00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.712\n>> I like the way you put that.\n\n17\n00:00:53.712 --> 00:00:55.040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So he's exactly right.\n\n18\n00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.140\nWe want to take a look at doing some\nformatting and in this one, we're really\n\n19\n00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.570\ngonna focus on formatting the worksheet\nitself rather than what you might be\n\n20\n00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.950\nthinking we're getting ready to dive into\nlike fonts, font sizes, underlining, bold.\n\n21\n00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.292\nThose are things that we'll format when\nwe're formatting the actual data and\n\n22\n00:01:12.292 --> 00:01:14.984\nwe've got an episode where we're\ngoing to deal with all that.\n\n23\n00:01:14.984 --> 00:01:18.959\nHere we're really going to focus on what\nabout the layout of the workbook itself or\n\n24\n00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:20.813\nthe worksheets within the workbook?\n\n25\n00:01:20.813 --> 00:01:25.433\nSo we're talking about columns and\nrows and widths and themes and\n\n26\n00:01:25.433 --> 00:01:26.780\nthings like that.\n\n27\n00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.250\nThat's really what we're\ngoing to highlight here and\n\n28\n00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.790\nthe first thing I'm going to start\nwith is one of those features that\n\n29\n00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.550\nsome of you might find really cool and\nmight think wow, that's fantastic.\n\n30\n00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.940\nOthers are gonna say whoop-te-do.\n\n31\n00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:40.780\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right.\n\n32\n00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.410\n>> Why do we care?\n\n33\n00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.360\n>> When am I ever gonna do that and\nwho cares?\n\n34\n00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.190\nSo, but let's do it anyway,\nfor those of you that say wow,\n\n35\n00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.060\nthat is the best thing ever,\nI can really use that in my job,\n\n36\n00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.960\nI'm not gonna leave you out,\nso Let's take a look at it.\n\n37\n00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.630\nAnd what I'm referring to\nis coloring our tabs right.\n\n38\n00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.360\nWe've seen that a work book is a container\nand it contains work sheets and\n\n39\n00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.840\nit can have several worksheets in there.\n\n40\n00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.820\nIn fact like I said there's really no\nlimit other than your system resources\n\n41\n00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.800\nhow many worksheets you can\ncreate within that workbook.\n\n42\n00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.970\nSo you might find and\n\n43\n00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.970\nI have had several workbooks that\nhave dozens of sheets in them right?\n\n44\n00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.800\nTo the point where as you can see on this\none that I'm working with right now only\n\n45\n00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.160\nhas about six I think down there seven so\nI got of plenty of room over here but\n\n46\n00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.680\nfor giggles let's just here oops [LAUGH]\nLet me just add a few sheets in here.\n\n47\n00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.480\nI'm just clicking that plus sign over and\nover and over again it keeps moving on me.\n\n48\n00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.780\nI'm gonna zoom back out.\n\n49\n00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.030\nAnd now you can see, I don't have\nenough room to show all the sheets.\n\n50\n00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.510\nI've got a little set of triangles over\n\n51\n00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.430\nthat I can now use to navigate\nbetween all those work sheets.\n\n52\n00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.640\nI can drag this little\nscroll bar over a little bit\n\n53\n00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.420\nto give me a little more room there but\nI still can't fit them all.\n\n54\n00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.000\nSo if you're working with workbooks like\nthis, and I've gotta really kinda need to\n\n55\n00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.750\ngo back and get rid of all of those,\nyou might find this feature useful.\n\n56\n00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.030\nAnd it's just coloring the tabs all right?\n\n57\n00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.740\nThat's all we're talking about here.\n\n58\n00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:02.690\nAnd it's easy to do.\n\n59\n00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.600\nYou go to the tab, you right click\non it and you choose tab color,\n\n60\n00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.790\nand you get a little slide out, and\nyou can pick the color you want.\n\n61\n00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.440\nSo, you can see, that turn that tab green.\n\n62\n00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.240\nNow, while it's highlighted, it is kinda\ngreen across the bottom, when I go to\n\n63\n00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.195\nanother sheet, you can now see that,\nthat tab is actually green, right?\n\n64\n00:03:23.195 --> 00:03:26.155\nIt was highlighted it's\nkinda a shaded green there.\n\n65\n00:03:26.155 --> 00:03:29.365\nI can do any all of\nthese different colors.\n\n66\n00:03:29.365 --> 00:03:31.165\nLet's just delete that one.\n\n67\n00:03:31.165 --> 00:03:34.593\nI'll go back and\ndelete a bunch of these here in a second.\n\n68\n00:03:34.593 --> 00:03:37.377\nSo you can pick all your\ndifferent colors that you want.\n\n69\n00:03:37.377 --> 00:03:42.080\nSo, again, if you want to color code\nyour tabs Excel gives you that ability.\n\n70\n00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.860\nI always think of the dentist's\noffice where they've got those manila\n\n71\n00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.480\nfolders in those racks behind there and\nlike all the Rs are red, and\n\n72\n00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.030\nall the Ts are blue, kind of helps\nthem find where they need to be.\n\n73\n00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.770\nYou know, maybe you wanna make it\nmatch some filing system you have, or\n\n74\n00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.000\nmaybe you like colorful things,\nor you like to do rainbows.\n\n75\n00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.420\nOr you want to make sure that summary\nstands out from the rest of them.\n\n76\n00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.640\nMaybe that's the only one you color.\n\n77\n00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.770\nWhatever your need is,\n\n78\n00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.730\nwhy ever you choose to do the color tabs,\nunderstand it's very easy.\n\n79\n00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.860\nNow all we have to do is go in there and\nright click on the the tab, choose color,\n\n80\n00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.500\nand we're good to go.\n\n81\n00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.010\nI can turn it back to no color\nif I want to get rid of that.\n\n82\n00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.610\nBy right clicking tab color and\nno color so pretty easy to do.\n\n83\n00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.330\n>> And Mike I can see where this would be\nreally useful especially if I'm tracking\n\n84\n00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.730\ninformation from things like you know\ndifferent branches or something right.\n\n85\n00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.190\nThe very fact is that the data actually\nis going to remain relatively the same\n\n86\n00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.740\nbetween those branches, but\n\n87\n00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.390\nI still need to be able to\ndistinguish them very quickly.\n\n88\n00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.220\nColoring each of those tabs\nmay give me that ability\n\n89\n00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.710\ninstead of me entering in data\nwrongly on one of those sheets.\n\n90\n00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.890\nEven though I might have labeled that tab\nbefore, then changed it the way that you\n\n91\n00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.820\nhave it, it could be that I still enter\nin data wrong on another sheet and\n\n92\n00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.490\nthen have to go back and change it.\n\n93\n00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.200\nBy separating out those colors,\n\n94\n00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.450\nit can really help us to be able to\nmanage it a little bit better, and\n\n95\n00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.805\nmake it easier for us to identify, thereby\nmaking us a little bit more productive.\n\n96\n00:05:03.805 --> 00:05:04.770\n>> Mm-hm.\nAbsolutely.\n\n97\n00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.000\nI've seen places where you do color\nschemes, you get a spreadsheet for\n\n98\n00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.100\nan employee, they can say it's employee\ndata, and you've got one color to\n\n99\n00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.870\nrepresent their company information,\ntheir name and their-.\n\n100\n00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.000\n>> Position.\n\n101\n00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.330\n>> Yeah, position and\npay rate and things like that.\n\n102\n00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.650\nBut a different color tab to represent\ntheir personal information, right?\n\n103\n00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.780\nAnd then each person has their own\nworkbook or something like that.\n\n104\n00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.310\nSo definitely some uses for it.\n\n105\n00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.050\nYou might find that useful\nin your role with Excel.\n\n106\n00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.700\nAll right, some other things that we\nneed to be able to do is insert and\n\n107\n00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.410\ndeleting columns and rows.\n\n108\n00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.830\nThis is another one that there's\na few ways to do it, and\n\n109\n00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.320\nit's pretty straightforward, but\nthere are some little quirks, or\n\n110\n00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.980\nthings that we've gotta consider\nwhen we're doing this, all right?\n\n111\n00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.660\nSo for example, and I know this looks\nhorrible right now, we're gonna get\n\n112\n00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.470\nto formatting this and making this look\na little better, I did that intentionally.\n\n113\n00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.800\nBut for now I wanna do as we're just\ngoing down those objective lists,\n\n114\n00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.000\nI wanna do some insert columns and rows.\n\n115\n00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.880\nObviously, rows are running horizontal.\n\n116\n00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.630\nColumns are going to be vertical.\n\n117\n00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:08.950\nAnd the key to remember with Excel, any\ntime you're inserting something, right?\n\n118\n00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.610\nHere's what you've got to remember.\n\n119\n00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.090\nThis corner up here is fixed, and\nlet me just zoom in real quick there.\n\n120\n00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.850\nRight?\n\n121\n00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.440\nA1 is fixed.\n\n122\n00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.830\nThere is nothing to the left,\nthere is no column negative A,\n\n123\n00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.100\nand there is nothing above this.\n\n124\n00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.450\nThere is no column row zero or\nnegative one.\n\n125\n00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.860\nSo if I'm going to insert something\n\n126\n00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.970\nThat means I've gotta shift everything\nelse around to make room for that.\n\n127\n00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:38.960\nI cannot go to the left and I cannot go up\nbecause that's a fixed point right there.\n\n128\n00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.500\nSo when I go to insert something,\nbe it a cell, be it a row, be it a column,\n\n129\n00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.140\nwhat have you, everything's either gonna\nshift to the right or it's going to shift\n\n130\n00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.420\ndown, and that's the one thing that I\nthink people just need to remember because\n\n131\n00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:55.300\nwhen I go to insert it, do I click\nthe row I want to move down or is it\n\n132\n00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.880\ngoing to move up, and where's my new row\ngoing to be depending on where I select?\n\n133\n00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.780\nAll you got to do is remember,\nyou can't go up and you can't go right.\n\n134\n00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.120\nIt's always going to be down,\nI'm sorry, can't go left.\n\n135\n00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.340\nIt's always going to be down and\nto the right.\n\n136\n00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.620\nFor example,\nlet's say I want to insert a new row.\n\n137\n00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.260\nWe'll just go down here.\n\n138\n00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.740\nAnd I want to put something in between\nthese two rows between 18 and 19.\n\n139\n00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.870\nWell if I want something in between 18 and\n\n140\n00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:25.700\n19 I'm gonna select row 19 because\nit's gonna shift down, right.\n\n141\n00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.390\nSo then I'm gonna right-click,\nand I'll zoom out so\n\n142\n00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:32.880\nwe can see that a little better, my\nmenu there, and I'm gonna choose insert.\n\n143\n00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.120\nNotice it doesn't ask me\nwhat do you wanna insert?\n\n144\n00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.180\nBecause I have a row selected,\nit's gonna make an assumption.\n\n145\n00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.930\nIt's gonna say, all right,\nhe wants to insert a row.\n\n146\n00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:46.830\nSo I click insert and now I've got\na blank row between 18 and what was 19.\n\n147\n00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:51.275\nAnd the data that was on\n19 is now down to row 20.\n\n148\n00:07:51.275 --> 00:07:53.858\nSo everything shifted down, all right?\n\n149\n00:07:53.858 --> 00:07:55.460\nNow the columns work the same way.\n\n150\n00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.691\nIf I wanna put something in between B and\nC.\n\n151\n00:07:58.691 --> 00:08:02.647\nThen I'm gonna actually select column C\nbecause I know everything's gonna shift\n\n152\n00:08:02.647 --> 00:08:04.078\nover to the right.\n\n153\n00:08:04.078 --> 00:08:06.700\nRight-click > Insert, and\n\n154\n00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:11.940\nI now have a new column in between B and\nwhat was C, and now D.\n\n155\n00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.028\nEverything shifted over.\n\n156\n00:08:14.028 --> 00:08:17.610\nSo I'm gonna undo those, just to get\nmy workbook back the way it was.\n\n157\n00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:23.550\nRemember, Ctrl+Z is your friend,\nthat is your undo command.\n\n158\n00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:27.190\nAnd as I remember my scrolling\noptions here, my zoom options.\n\n159\n00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:30.410\nAll right, so pretty straight\nforward as far as inserting a row or\n\n160\n00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:31.690\ninserting a column.\n\n161\n00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:36.800\nNow, if I have a cell selected, and not\na row, when I go to insert, I can go to\n\n162\n00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:42.830\nmy Insert menu and I could come over here\nand I could choose, where are we at here.\n\n163\n00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:43.930\nOops.\n\n164\n00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:46.640\nOn my Home, and I can go to Cells.\n\n165\n00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.790\nAnd I guess we're not gonna\nreally talk about cells, but\n\n166\n00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:53.930\nthose Insert sheet rows and\nInsert sheet column is here, all right.\n\n167\n00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:55.220\nBecause I don't have a column or\n\n168\n00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:58.310\nrow selected,\nit can't make that assumption for me.\n\n169\n00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:02.940\nIf I try to right-click out here and I go\nto Insert, notice Insert has little dots\n\n170\n00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.710\nbehind it, those ellipses that tells\nme a dialogue boxes is gonna open up.\n\n171\n00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:08.470\nSo I choose Insert, it says,\nwell, what do you wanna do?\n\n172\n00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:12.490\nAnd it's gonna say, do you want to\ndo an entire row or entire column?\n\n173\n00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:14.874\nKeep in mind everything's\ngonna shift right and down.\n\n174\n00:09:14.874 --> 00:09:19.587\nAnd again, we'll talk about insert\ncells in a future episode here.\n\n175\n00:09:19.587 --> 00:09:21.360\nSo that's another way you can do it.\n\n176\n00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.290\nI always find it easier just to click\non that row header or column header and\n\n177\n00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:27.210\ninsert it that way.\n\n178\n00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.480\nAnother thing you gotta be careful\nwith when we're doing the insert,\n\n179\n00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.370\nI said it was pretty simple but\n\n180\n00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:34.690\nthere's a couple things that you can catch\nyourself with, get yourself in trouble.\n\n181\n00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:39.600\nI wanna put a new row right\nhere between 6 and 7, right?\n\n182\n00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.450\nSo it's okay, I'll go to 7 and\nI'll insert a row.\n\n183\n00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:49.160\nBut what I forgot about was the fact that\na row doesn't stop where my data stops.\n\n184\n00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.380\nThat row goes all the way\nout to the very last column.\n\n185\n00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.780\nSo when you insert,\nsomething it goes all the way out, and\n\n186\n00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.190\nlook at my little table\nthat I had over here.\n\n187\n00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:01.300\nNow I've got this blank row in\nthe middle of my table, all right?\n\n188\n00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.095\nSo something that you've got to keep\nin mind, if you had a spreadsheet\n\n189\n00:10:04.095 --> 00:10:07.990\nwhere you've got data in different places\nor different areas, when you go to\n\n190\n00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:12.030\ninsert that row, you've got to remember\nthat it goes all the way across.\n\n191\n00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:16.560\nIf I didn't want that to happen, in\nthis case what I would really have to do\n\n192\n00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.850\nis just select here and\nthen do Insert cells.\n\n193\n00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:25.760\nI'm not really inserting a row at this\npoint, I’m inserting a few cells.\n\n194\n00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.640\nAnd again,\nwe'll talk about this in a little bit,\n\n195\n00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:32.340\nbut if I insert cells, Shift cells down,\nnotice it's either down or right.\n\n196\n00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.420\nLeft or up is not available.\n\n197\n00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:38.450\nI click OK.\nNow I've got a new row, if you will,\n\n198\n00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:41.720\nor of a new area within this data set, but\n\n199\n00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:45.920\nit didn't affect this data set over here,\nright?\n\n200\n00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.830\nTables will solve that problem.\n\n201\n00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:51.490\nNow, we've got a whole episode\nwe're gonna dedicate to tables, but\n\n202\n00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:53.000\nlet me make one real quick.\n\n203\n00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.480\nI'm just going to go over here and\ndo a little Insert Table.\n\n204\n00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.480\nAnd change that to a table.\n\n205\n00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.770\nTables are interesting,\nand they're fantastic,\n\n206\n00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:04.630\nyou're gonna love the episode that I\nhave lined up for you on tables, but\n\n207\n00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:09.290\nI just wanna show you, when you click\ninside a table, and you go to Insert,\n\n208\n00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:14.800\nyou're gonna get Insert table rows,\nor Insert table columns.\n\n209\n00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:19.910\nIt's smart enough to know they probably\nwanna insert this just within the table.\n\n210\n00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:24.890\nAnd so, when I do that, again it slides\neverything down, insert row above, right?\n\n211\n00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:26.300\nSlide everything else down.\n\n212\n00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:30.160\nNotice it did not affect my\ndata over here, all right?\n\n213\n00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.350\nSo something to keep in mind again.\n\n214\n00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:34.980\nI'll point that out again when we\ngo back and we cover the tables.\n\n215\n00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:39.120\nBut inserting rows and columns,\ndeleting is just the opposite.\n\n216\n00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:45.020\nIf I wanna delete a column,\nI can select that column, right-click, and\n\n217\n00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.740\nthen choose Delete.\n\n218\n00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:51.400\nAnd when you insert,\nit shifts to the right and down.\n\n219\n00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.140\nGuess what it's gonna do when we delete.\n\n220\n00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.590\nIt's gonna shift things to the left and\nup, right?\n\n221\n00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:04.880\nSo if I delete quantity, well, now unit\nprice and everything else in that sheet,\n\n222\n00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:09.740\neven this little area, all slid\nover one column to the left there.\n\n223\n00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:11.580\nAll right, the same thing for rows.\n\n224\n00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:15.760\nIf I delete that row, even though\nI'm just focusing on this data here,\n\n225\n00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.580\nwhen I go delete the row,\nI also lost the row and\n\n226\n00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:22.110\nthis data over here cuz that row goes\nall the way across that spreadsheet.\n\n227\n00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:24.210\nSo you gotta keep that in mind, and\n\n228\n00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:27.970\nI'll undo that real quick,\nwhen you're working with those.\n\n229\n00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:30.420\nAll right, so we've got that\ndown pat I think, inserting and\n\n230\n00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:31.520\ndeleting rows and columns.\n\n231\n00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:35.670\nNext we wanna do, is we wanna work\nwith the sizing of these columns and\n\n232\n00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:36.290\nof these rows.\n\n233\n00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:39.350\nAnd as you can see, Ronnie, my spreadsheet\ndoesn't look that good, does it?\n\n234\n00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:40.830\n>> Now,\nwhen we take a look at this, right,\n\n235\n00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:43.040\nthis is why formatting is very important.\n\n236\n00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:47.510\nA lot of times we might be able to see\nfully what we need to in certain columns,\n\n237\n00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:48.380\nbut notice now,\n\n238\n00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:53.250\nI think it's actually in column C there,\nthat you really can't see everything.\n\n239\n00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:55.880\nAnd this is where people do\nget a little bit flustered and\n\n240\n00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.920\nthey're starting to\nwonder what has happened.\n\n241\n00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.690\nIf you haven't been working Excel,\nyou might have actually wondered if\n\n242\n00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:02.960\nExcel actually did something\nto damage your data.\n\n243\n00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.075\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\nAnd so- >> Messed it all up.\n\n244\n00:13:04.075 --> 00:13:05.630\n>> Yeah, so it's messed it all up.\n\n245\n00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:08.738\nSo being able to actually control this is\nsomething that you want to actually be\n\n246\n00:13:08.738 --> 00:13:10.023\nable to do, and it really does.\n\n247\n00:13:10.023 --> 00:13:14.757\nIt actually lends to the format, and it\nshows where you took the time to make sure\n\n248\n00:13:14.757 --> 00:13:18.230\nthat you could present the data\nthe way that you wanted to.\n\n249\n00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:19.310\n>> Absolutely.\n\n250\n00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:21.580\nLet's take a look at\nthe way Excel behaves here.\n\n251\n00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:25.780\nAnd I'm just gonna come out here and\ntype my name, and you'll\n\n252\n00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:31.160\nsee that my name goes over, outside of\nthat cell, I can still see the whole name.\n\n253\n00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:35.860\nWith text, Excel says, if there's\nnothing in the cell next to it and\n\n254\n00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:40.010\nwhat I'm typing is bigger than that cell,\nI'll just let it flow over.\n\n255\n00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:42.740\nIt's not actually in the cell here, right.\n\n256\n00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:44.980\nThe data is wholly contained within here.\n\n257\n00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:47.685\nBut since there's nothing in this cell,\nit's blank, it says,\n\n258\n00:13:47.685 --> 00:13:50.350\nI'm not gonna anything,\nI'll go ahead and display it.\n\n259\n00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:54.790\nAs soon as I put something in here,\nit can no longer do that, right?\n\n260\n00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:59.390\nNow you'll see that it chops my name off\nbecause it can't hide what's in this cell.\n\n261\n00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:03.440\nIf I delete that, now it says, okay,\nthere's nothing there, I'll go ahead and\n\n262\n00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:04.770\nlet it overlap.\n\n263\n00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:07.140\nNumbers, it does it\na little bit differently.\n\n264\n00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:08.940\nI don't even know if I\ncan force it to do this.\n\n265\n00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.440\nLet's see.\nSo you see what it did,\n\n266\n00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.080\nit changed it to scientific notation.\n\n267\n00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.330\nExcel will not ever chop off numbers.\n\n268\n00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:21.310\nIt'll never show you part of a number and\nnot the entire number.\n\n269\n00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:24.380\nIt's either gonna change\nit to scientific notation,\n\n270\n00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.020\nlike it did here with the little exponent.\n\n271\n00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:31.330\nSo this is 1.23412 to the power of 19.\n\n272\n00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:35.275\nOr it's gonna just show you a bunch\nof hashtags, right, the pound symbol.\n\n273\n00:14:35.275 --> 00:14:38.260\nSaying, hey, there's a number here,\nbut I can't show it all so\n\n274\n00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:39.680\nI'm not gonna show you any of it.\n\n275\n00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.950\nAnd that's because, think about it,\nif we had like budgets or\n\n276\n00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:44.880\nsomething like that, and\nI said you owed $100,000, but\n\n277\n00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:48.340\nit wouldn't fit in the cell so\nit chopped it off and\n\n278\n00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:52.315\nit only looks like you owe $1,000, that's\ngonna cause some real problems, right.\n\n279\n00:14:52.315 --> 00:14:55.060\nSo, it'll never do that with numbers.\n\n280\n00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:58.850\nOnly with text will it let\nthose overlap if need to.\n\n281\n00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:01.375\nAll right, so how do we fix this?\n\n282\n00:15:01.375 --> 00:15:05.130\nCuz as Ronnie says, if we zoom in over\nhere, we've got some real issues.\n\n283\n00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:10.130\nI've got my header row but\nmy data is not fitting in there.\n\n284\n00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:12.370\nSo a couple of things I can do with this.\n\n285\n00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:15.960\nFirst of all, I can select the column.\n\n286\n00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.470\nAll right, so let me select that column.\n\n287\n00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:19.570\nLet me zoom out so\nwe can see what I'm doing here.\n\n288\n00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:20.320\nSelect that column.\n\n289\n00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:24.470\nI can right-click on that column,\nand I can choose Column width.\n\n290\n00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:28.270\nAll right, they're 8.43 by default there.\n\n291\n00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:29.720\nAnd I can type in something else.\n\n292\n00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.035\nLet's say I want to go 12 instead.\n\n293\n00:15:32.035 --> 00:15:35.340\nThen you can see that column\ngot a little bit wider.\n\n294\n00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:40.530\nStill doesn't fit, so I could sit here and\nsay, okay, let me try 14, let me try 18.\n\n295\n00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:41.633\nOops, that's too big.\n\n296\n00:15:41.633 --> 00:15:42.953\nLet me try 16.\n\n297\n00:15:42.953 --> 00:15:45.503\nI could play around with the numbers\nuntil I got it to fit, but\n\n298\n00:15:45.503 --> 00:15:47.560\nExcel gives you an easier way to do that.\n\n299\n00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.655\nAll right?\nBetween each one of these column headers,\n\n300\n00:15:50.655 --> 00:15:54.386\nyou notice as I move my mouse\nover that line between them,\n\n301\n00:15:54.386 --> 00:15:57.214\nsee how it changes to a two-headed arrow?\n\n302\n00:15:57.214 --> 00:15:59.498\nI can click and drag.\n\n303\n00:15:59.498 --> 00:16:02.179\nAnd now I can drag that column border.\n\n304\n00:16:02.179 --> 00:16:09.190\nSo I can drag it out until I can see\nthe entire Tampa General Hospital there.\n\n305\n00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:12.015\nSo that's one way you can do it.\n\n306\n00:16:12.015 --> 00:16:15.310\nWell a couple of ways, you can right click\nto the number, you can also click and\n\n307\n00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:17.440\ndrag and move that column.\n\n308\n00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.230\nBut what if I can't see all my data?\n\n309\n00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:24.090\nI might have an entry down here further\nthat's even wider than that, and\n\n310\n00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:26.460\nit's still chopped off,\nI just don't see it.\n\n311\n00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:28.760\nExcel gives me another way to do this.\n\n312\n00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.660\nYou can actually just double click, so\nwhat I'm doing is I'm on that border\n\n313\n00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.980\nagain, but I'm not going to hold my mouse\ndown, I'm just going to double click.\n\n314\n00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:38.360\nAnd I say I'm going to.\n\n315\n00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.210\nThere we go.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n316\n00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:40.520\n>> And it's going to stretch that column\n\n317\n00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:45.290\nout to the widest item of that column,\nso what we call auto fit the column.\n\n318\n00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:48.260\nThere's an option for\nthat on your menu as well, but it's so\n\n319\n00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.950\neasy to just go there and\ndouble click and let it move things out.\n\n320\n00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:55.630\nLook out big that one got and you're\nthinking why the heck did it get that big?\n\n321\n00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:57.380\nWhat's all that white space for?\n\n322\n00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:02.020\nWell that's because somewhere in\nthis sheet there is a longer name.\n\n323\n00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.080\nAnd it needed that room, right?\n\n324\n00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.770\nSo when you double click, it doesn't\nlook at just what you're viewing,\n\n325\n00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:08.290\nit looks at that entire column.\n\n326\n00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:12.330\nIt says I'm gonna make this column\nwide enough to fit any item\n\n327\n00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:14.430\nin this particular column, all right?\n\n328\n00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:18.360\nNow it's not gonna resize,\nlike if I made this one, oops.\n\n329\n00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:21.150\nLike if I went and\nstarted adding data to this,\n\n330\n00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:24.750\nit's not going to automatically\nexpand the column.\n\n331\n00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:26.370\nNow that one's chopped off, right.\n\n332\n00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:28.520\nBut I could just double-click again and\n\n333\n00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.100\nit'll move out to however\nwide it needs to be.\n\n334\n00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:32.790\nSo that's that auto fit option.\n\n335\n00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:35.930\nYou just double-click on the border,\nall right?\n\n336\n00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:38.420\nLet's fix a couple of other places here.\n\n337\n00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:41.310\nI'm gonna go ahead and\njust double-click, move that over, so\n\n338\n00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:42.480\nnow I can see everything there.\n\n339\n00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.749\nWe'll get rid of that.\n\n340\n00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:45.790\nAll right.\n\n341\n00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:47.140\nNow that's not too bad.\n\n342\n00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:47.770\nPretty easy to do.\n\n343\n00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:49.890\nAnd it's the same thing with rows.\n\n344\n00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:53.570\nIf I want to change a row height\nI can right-click on that row,\n\n345\n00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:58.040\nchoose row height, and\nI can set the numeric value 15 by default.\n\n346\n00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:02.860\nI can go to the border and\nI can drag and make those guys bigger or\n\n347\n00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:06.180\nI can double-click,\nit'll do the same thing.\n\n348\n00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:08.770\n>> That really does tend\nto help when you end up\n\n349\n00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:11.660\nchanging font sizes and\nall of a sudden you realize that it's not\n\n350\n00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.510\nactually showing you\neverything that you need to.\n\n351\n00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:17.145\nBeing able to adjust the row height as\nwell as the column height is really gonna\n\n352\n00:18:17.145 --> 00:18:21.480\nbe able to allow you to put that worksheet\nand format it the best way that you can.\n\n353\n00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.690\nThat way, whenever you're actually\npresenting your data to someone,\n\n354\n00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:27.490\nthey don't look at it and go, wow,\nwhy is all this stuff jammed up together?\n\n355\n00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:31.410\nWhy can't I see what the full name\nthat's supposed to be listing here is?\n\n356\n00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:32.570\nJust doing a simple little thing,\n\n357\n00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:35.770\nlike double clicking in between\nthe column headers or the row headers,\n\n358\n00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:39.810\nbeing able to adjust them that quickly\nis a tremendous amount of help.\n\n359\n00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:42.200\nWhen you do need to do\nsomething like printing or\n\n360\n00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.090\ndoing anything like that in\nterms of presentation, too.\n\n361\n00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:46.610\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n362\n00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:48.040\nAnd in fact,\nI can show you what Ronnie means.\n\n363\n00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:52.940\nI'm gonna go over here and just make\nthis header row a little bit bigger.\n\n364\n00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:56.520\nAnd you see actually Excel's doing\na pretty good job of resizing the row.\n\n365\n00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:01.130\nNotice it resized the row height, but\nit didn't fix my column width there.\n\n366\n00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:04.090\nAnd sometimes you'll find if you\njust type big text in there,\n\n367\n00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:05.910\nthat it doesn't adjust that either.\n\n368\n00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:10.260\nSo as I said, just double-click between\nthose columns, and you're good to go.\n\n369\n00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.430\nAll right, so I undid that boldness\nthere on our column row, but\n\n370\n00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:16.710\nI wanna show you I've got other\ntabs that need to be fixed, right?\n\n371\n00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:18.640\nSo I could do what we did with January.\n\n372\n00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:22.680\nI could go to February,\nI could double-click on the borders, and\n\n373\n00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.040\ngo to each one.\n\n374\n00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.180\nAnd eventually I'd get it done, right?\n\n375\n00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:27.490\nThat's a lot of work.\n\n376\n00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:28.670\nHere's another trick.\n\n377\n00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:32.230\nWhat if I grab all the columns right?\n\n378\n00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:35.060\nNow I just go to, it doesn't matter\nwhich column between I double click,\n\n379\n00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:37.530\nI'm just gonna click on\none of the borders and\n\n380\n00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:40.350\nnotice how it resized all\nthe columns at the same time.\n\n381\n00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:41.750\nAnd not all to the same size.\n\n382\n00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:45.670\nIt looked at each column and said,\nhow wide do I need to make this?\n\n383\n00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:47.610\nAnd I'll take it a step further right.\n\n384\n00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:49.760\nI still have four sheets to do.\n\n385\n00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.760\nWell Mike, you just showed us how we just\ngo to the sheet, select the columns,\n\n386\n00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.830\ndouble click, move on to the next sheet.\n\n387\n00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.060\nWhat if I do this?\n\n388\n00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.240\nWhat if I select all the sheets?\n\n389\n00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:01.540\nI'm just clicking on the first one,\nholding down shift and\n\n390\n00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:02.570\nclicking on the last one.\n\n391\n00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:05.000\nNow I have four sheets selected.\n\n392\n00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.170\nI'm gonna select all the columns.\n\n393\n00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:11.510\nI'm gonna double-click, and\nnow I'll click away to deselect.\n\n394\n00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:16.210\nAnd you'll see that March is fixed,\nApril's fixed, May, and June.\n\n395\n00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:20.450\nAnd it doesn't matter if the data\nis not the same width, right?\n\n396\n00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:21.930\nThe same columns was important.\n\n397\n00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:23.829\nIt's only gonna do the first five columns.\n\n398\n00:20:23.829 --> 00:20:26.012\nIf one of those sheets would\nhave had seven columns,\n\n399\n00:20:26.012 --> 00:20:28.156\nit would resize the first five and\nnot the last two.\n\n400\n00:20:28.156 --> 00:20:28.690\nRight?\n\n401\n00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:29.880\nBecause I only selected five columns.\n\n402\n00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:34.840\nYou know what another trick I should show\nyou guys, we talked about inserting and\n\n403\n00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.580\ndeleting rows and columns.\n\n404\n00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:39.150\nAnd I did a single row and\na single column.\n\n405\n00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:42.740\nThere are times when you know\nI need more rows than that,\n\n406\n00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:46.460\nyou don't have to insert\none row at a time.\n\n407\n00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:50.190\nWhen I selected one column and\nthen insert it.\n\n408\n00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:53.240\nIf I select four columns, and\n\n409\n00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:57.570\nthen right click Insert,\nnotice it inserts four columns.\n\n410\n00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:58.720\nSame thing with rows.\n\n411\n00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:02.188\nIf I select multiple rows, and\nthen I right click at Insert,\n\n412\n00:21:02.188 --> 00:21:06.210\nhowever many rows I have selected,\nthat's how many it's gonna Insert.\n\n413\n00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:10.380\nSo it's just some little time-saving\ntricks for you there as you go through and\n\n414\n00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:11.720\ndo some of this formatting.\n\n415\n00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:15.750\nAll right, so we looked at change\nin the work sheet tab, crawler,\n\n416\n00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:16.730\ninserting and deleting rows.\n\n417\n00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:19.500\nYou know what, I almost skipped over\ngood old Page Setup, didn't I, Ronnie?\n\n418\n00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.470\n>> Yeah.\n>> They gotta take a look at that.\n\n419\n00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:25.680\nLet's look at Page Setup,\nthis is on my Page Layout ribbon,\n\n420\n00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:29.340\nand it really has to do with\nprinting more than anything.\n\n421\n00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:31.580\nWhen you get ready to\nprint your worksheet,\n\n422\n00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:36.250\nyou're gonna need to adjust some of these,\ndepending on what you have.\n\n423\n00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:37.970\nIt's pretty straightforward.\n\n424\n00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:40.590\nOrientation, I'll start with that\none just because it's the easiest.\n\n425\n00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:42.050\nLandscape or portrait.\n\n426\n00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:42.550\nRight?\n\n427\n00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:45.990\nPortrait is where it's\ntaller than it is wide.\n\n428\n00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:48.330\nLandscape it's going to\nbe wider than it is tall.\n\n429\n00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:52.260\nIf we're dealing with USNR\nstandard documents with 8.5x11.\n\n430\n00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:55.060\nSo eight and\na half wide by 11 high for portrait.\n\n431\n00:21:55.060 --> 00:22:00.390\nLandscape 11 wide by eight and a half\nhigh and I find that especially useful\n\n432\n00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:06.280\nwhen I'm working in Excel, because a lot\nof times my data is wider than it is tall.\n\n433\n00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:07.990\nOr it might be tall.\n\n434\n00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:11.360\nThere might be 3,000 rows,\nbut because it has so\n\n435\n00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:15.970\nmany columns, when I try to print it,\nit gets a little wonky, right?\n\n436\n00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:18.510\nBecause it can print\nthe first four columns, but\n\n437\n00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:21.760\nthe next two columns have\nto go on a separate page.\n\n438\n00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:25.080\nI know I'm going to get page\nbreaks because I have 3000 rows.\n\n439\n00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:30.550\nBut if I rotate that to a landscape, now I\ncan fit all my columns on the same page.\n\n440\n00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:32.480\nI'm still gonna have page breaks every so\n\n441\n00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:36.880\nmany rows, but\nat least all my columns fit on one page.\n\n442\n00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.920\nSo play around with your portrait and\nlandscape options.\n\n443\n00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.770\nYou also have sizing, depending on\nwhat you're printing to, right?\n\n444\n00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:46.060\nLetter, legal, you can see they\nhave a few pre-builts in here, and\n\n445\n00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:48.710\nI say a few as you see if\nyou scroll through there.\n\n446\n00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:51.980\nQuite a few, some cards,\nsome index card sizes.\n\n447\n00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:53.700\nThere's also margins.\n\n448\n00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:57.110\nThis could effect how much\ndata you can fit on that page.\n\n449\n00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:02.560\nIf I'm just one column short trying\nto get it to fit on one page and\n\n450\n00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.382\nI'm using normal margins.\n\n451\n00:23:04.382 --> 00:23:07.600\n0.75 on either side, left and\n\n452\n00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:12.520\nright, if I reduce those,\nI could gain another half inch or an inch.\n\n453\n00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:16.730\nI can now fit that column on that one\npage and not have to go to a second page.\n\n454\n00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:21.450\nSo you've got some pre-built ones,\nnormal, wide, and narrow.\n\n455\n00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:25.500\nAnd then of course you can always go\nin and do your custom margins as well,\n\n456\n00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:29.070\nwhere you manually specify the margins,\nthe top to bottom,\n\n457\n00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:33.530\nleft, right, as well as the header and\nthe footer margins there.\n\n458\n00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:36.920\n>> Mike, I see this as being very\ninformed because like you, and\n\n459\n00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:40.480\nprobably like everybody else if we've ever\ntried to print out an Excel worksheet.\n\n460\n00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.570\nYou always look at it and\ngo, hey that looks fine, and\n\n461\n00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:45.330\nthen you hit the Print, and all of\na sudden the first page comes out and\n\n462\n00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:50.070\nthen the second page comes out, and its\ngot that one, column there that's left.\n\n463\n00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:53.802\nAnd so margins is probably one of the ways\nthat we can use to help us to adjust that.\n\n464\n00:23:53.802 --> 00:23:58.056\nSo it does actually pay for us to take\nthe time to learn how to manipulate those.\n\n465\n00:23:58.056 --> 00:23:58.567\n>> Absolutely.\n\n466\n00:23:58.567 --> 00:23:59.839\nLet's see if we can\nmake a difference here.\n\n467\n00:23:59.839 --> 00:24:03.590\nI'll take a look at I'm gonna go File, and\n\n468\n00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:08.294\nthen my Print, and\nwe'll see a little preview here.\n\n469\n00:24:08.294 --> 00:24:10.850\nYou'll see I have seven pages, all right.\n\n470\n00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:11.875\nIt should let me.\n\n471\n00:24:11.875 --> 00:24:13.790\n[LAUGH] I'll zoom in in a second.\n\n472\n00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:16.044\nI'll go through some of\nthese different pages here.\n\n473\n00:24:16.044 --> 00:24:21.543\nYou'll see how the summary,\nin this case, I think on the last page.\n\n474\n00:24:21.543 --> 00:24:23.990\nI got this summary information.\n\n475\n00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:27.910\nWell, that is actually right out here,\nright?\n\n476\n00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:30.030\nBut you see this dotted,\nI don't know if you can see that.\n\n477\n00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:31.080\nLet me zoom in.\n\n478\n00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.790\nSee, I made this dotted line?\n\n479\n00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:33.860\nThat's my page break, or\n\n480\n00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:39.470\nthat's where the print is going to break\nand put everything on another page.\n\n481\n00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:43.150\nSo if we zoom back out, and I'll try to,\nlet's just make up a few more columns.\n\n482\n00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:48.180\nWe'll say Test 1, Test 2,\n\n483\n00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:54.626\nwe'll insert a couple columns here.\n\n484\n00:24:54.626 --> 00:25:00.252\nSo now the problem is that\nwe'll make Test 3, all right?\n\n485\n00:25:00.252 --> 00:25:02.960\nSo now I've got columns\nall the way out to Test 3.\n\n486\n00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.330\nWhen I go File, Print.\n\n487\n00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:12.919\nWell, in my Print preview,\nif it will let me scroll into this.\n\n488\n00:25:12.919 --> 00:25:15.128\nIt's not letting me zoom in,\nI'll just zoom in manual here.\n\n489\n00:25:15.128 --> 00:25:20.510\nYou can see my columns only\ngo over to Test 1, right?\n\n490\n00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:22.890\nSo where the heck is test two and\ntest three?\n\n491\n00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:25.370\nSo as we go through here and\nlook at my pages,\n\n492\n00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:31.210\nwe're gonna see that there's Test 2 and\nTest 3 on that page there.\n\n493\n00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:33.870\nSo if we switch this over,\n\n494\n00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:39.150\nif I go back out to my I can do it from\nhere as well as from my ribbon, right?\n\n495\n00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:41.150\nSwitch this to landscape,\n\n496\n00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:46.410\nnow all the sudden,\nyou should see that all my columns fit.\n\n497\n00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:48.170\nThat little summary area doesn't fit.\n\n498\n00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:49.510\nIt's way out there, right?\n\n499\n00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:52.420\nBut I just wanted to show you how\nsometimes you are gonna break it there at\n\n500\n00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.640\nthat column, and\nthat's not gonna work for you.\n\n501\n00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:55.380\nFlip it, right?\n\n502\n00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:58.240\nDo a little landscape and\nthat might help you out just fine.\n\n503\n00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:02.215\nOr I can start playing with those margins,\nreducing the amount of white space on\n\n504\n00:26:02.215 --> 00:26:06.008\neither side, to give you a little more\nroom to squeeze that column in there,\n\n505\n00:26:06.008 --> 00:26:09.419\ncuz I think right now, what did I\nleave the Margins set at, Narrow?\n\n506\n00:26:09.419 --> 00:26:10.790\n>> I think about 0.75.\n\n507\n00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:13.420\n>> So what if I go to Wide margins?\n\n508\n00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:18.548\nNow if I go back to Print,\nall of a sudden, Test 3 is gone, right?\n\n509\n00:26:18.548 --> 00:26:23.071\nBut simply adjusting the Margins\nto Narrow or Normal,\n\n510\n00:26:23.071 --> 00:26:28.295\nprobably, in this case,\nI can fit all the columns on one page.\n\n511\n00:26:28.295 --> 00:26:32.250\nAnd not have to worry about taping\npages together, or anything like that.\n\n512\n00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:34.550\nSo, play around with those options there.\n\n513\n00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:39.042\nGet that page to fit just right to get the\nMargin the Orientation, the paper size.\n\n514\n00:26:39.042 --> 00:26:44.336\nWe're gonna talk later about print areas,\nwhich are really cool too.\n\n515\n00:26:44.336 --> 00:26:48.178\nGive you a heads up, what if I just wanted\nto print this area, every time I come in,\n\n516\n00:26:48.178 --> 00:26:51.780\nI don't wanna print all the details,\nI just want the summary info.\n\n517\n00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:52.980\nPrint areas will let me do that.\n\n518\n00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:54.300\nIt's a pretty cool little trick.\n\n519\n00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:56.294\n>> All right, so\nremember in this episode, right?\n\n520\n00:26:56.294 --> 00:26:59.910\nWe took a look at basic formatting and\nthere's still a lot more to go, but\n\n521\n00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:02.639\nwe did see some different\nfeatures that we can actually\n\n522\n00:27:02.639 --> 00:27:06.044\ntake advantage of that will help us\nto present the data that we want.\n\n523\n00:27:06.044 --> 00:27:08.560\nBut this is a great place for\nus to end the episode.\n\n524\n00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:12.030\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n525\n00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:12.900\n>> And, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n526\n00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:13.961\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n527\n00:27:13.961 --> 00:27:19.126\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:17.360\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n4\n00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.220\nAnd today we're going to be taking,\nwe've got Microsoft Excel 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.590\nNow what we are doing\nhere is we're picking up\n\n6\n00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.440\nfrom what we actually had last time\nin terms of formatting worksheets.\n\n7\n00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.520\nMaking sure that the data is presented\nthe way that we want to, but\n\n8\n00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.920\nwe still have a bit more to cover.\n\n9\n00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.960\nAnd here to help us out is gonna be Mr.\nMike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:35.860\nMike, how's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.447\n>> It's going great,\nRonnie and you're right.\n\n12\n00:00:37.447 --> 00:00:40.349\nWe got a few more things that we\ndidn't get to when it comes to\n\n13\n00:00:40.349 --> 00:00:41.870\nformatting these workbooks.\n\n14\n00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.700\nWe want to make sure we hit those.\n\n15\n00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.000\nAnd the first one we want to talk about\nhere is, let's do changing themes, right?\n\n16\n00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.510\nThat's another one of our\nobjectives that they call out.\n\n17\n00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.965\nAnd what I've done in this worksheet,\nit's the same workbook we were playing\n\n18\n00:00:54.965 --> 00:00:59.740\naround with earlier, but\nI converted this little area to a table.\n\n19\n00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.660\nAnd again, we've got a whole episode\nthat we're gonna deal with tables.\n\n20\n00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.170\nSo I'll show you how to do that and\nwhy they're so great.\n\n21\n00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.420\nBut the reason I did that,\nbefore we did this\n\n22\n00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.960\nworking with themes is because a theme\nis really a collection of settings.\n\n23\n00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.120\nWhen we talk about a theme for\na workbook, a collection of settings, and\n\n24\n00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.400\nthe settings are gonna include the font,\nwhich would be the font size as well.\n\n25\n00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:29.140\nThe color, as well as the effects that\nyou can have on some of your text.\n\n26\n00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.220\nWell, the problem is with most\nof my spreadsheets anyway,\n\n27\n00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.710\nunless there's tables in there,\nthere's probably not a lot of colors.\n\n28\n00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.890\nAnd a lot of things like that.\n\n29\n00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.310\nSo in fact here I'll show you.\n\n30\n00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.240\nIf you go to one of these workbooks here,\n\n31\n00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.760\nthemes are done off of\nthe Page Layout ribbon.\n\n32\n00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.930\nAnd over here I've got Themes.\n\n33\n00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.550\nAnd then you've got individually\nthat you can do colors,\n\n34\n00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.820\nyou can do fonts, right,\nand you can do Effects.\n\n35\n00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.290\nAnd a theme is kind of a combination of,\nit's just a collection of settings there\n\n36\n00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.020\nthat you can pick from\nthis pre-formatted list.\n\n37\n00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.850\nAnd as I hover over these,\n\n38\n00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.240\nyou'll notice that my data slightly\nshifts when I get to some of them.\n\n39\n00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.840\nThat's because one of them is using\na different font than the other one.\n\n40\n00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.640\nAnd those fonts have a different size.\n\n41\n00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.640\nWhen it's set to 12, one of them's still\na little bit smaller than the other one.\n\n42\n00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.610\nIt depends on the kerning, the spacing\nbetween, some fonts have more spacing and\n\n43\n00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.550\nmore lean.\n\n44\n00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.380\nSo even the same font\nsize might look different\n\n45\n00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.880\nto our eyes when we're looking at them.\n\n46\n00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.039\nBut that's all you see.\n\n47\n00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:28.340\nI'm gonna go over here\nwhere this table is and\n\n48\n00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.440\nit'll make a bigger difference\nwhen I change themes.\n\n49\n00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.660\nSo now when I go to Themes,\nif you watch the fonts still change, but\n\n50\n00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.780\nlook at the colors as well.\n\n51\n00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.370\nSo the colors of those tables change.\n\n52\n00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.050\nThis to me, it's kind of fluff, right?\n\n53\n00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.600\nBut Ronnie has said several times and\nit's very true that presentation is key.\n\n54\n00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.400\nIf we're gonna be sitting in\nfront of board members or\n\n55\n00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.930\ntaking this to our co-workers and\ngiving a presentation, or\n\n56\n00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.340\nsome kind of demonstration,\nwe want it to look good.\n\n57\n00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.783\nThey say you eat with your eyes, right?\n\n58\n00:02:58.783 --> 00:03:01.870\nIf your food looks good,\nit's probably gonna taste better to you.\n\n59\n00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.630\nAnd it's the same thing with data.\n\n60\n00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.840\nFonts and formats and\nthings like this make the data look good.\n\n61\n00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.580\nThey make it look professional and\n\n62\n00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.430\nalso gives us an ability to draw\nattention to certain things, right?\n\n63\n00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.030\nThat's a big thing to do with colors,\nlike if I choose one of these here.\n\n64\n00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.650\nI'll just leave it on the default.\n\n65\n00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:19.910\nThis area stands out.\n\n66\n00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.210\nYour eye is almost immediately\ndrawn to that summary area, right?\n\n67\n00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.980\nBecause it stands out from\nthe rest of the page.\n\n68\n00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.880\nSo, I don't wanna say\nthat colors are fluff and\n\n69\n00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.040\nyou should never use them, right?\n\n70\n00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.530\nThemes are great ways to apply it wholly,\nright?\n\n71\n00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.290\nTo everything in that worksheet,\nwithout having to do it individually or\n\n72\n00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.670\none step at a time.\n\n73\n00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.040\nIt's also a way to do it without\nhaving to think too much.\n\n74\n00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.600\nI dont have to pick a color,\nand a font, and an effect.\n\n75\n00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.360\nI just go grab one of those pre-built\nthemes and I'm done with it.\n\n76\n00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.973\nAnd if I need other workbooks\nto look the exact same, well,\n\n77\n00:03:48.973 --> 00:03:50.554\nI just pick the same theme, right?\n\n78\n00:03:50.554 --> 00:03:55.068\nI don't have to remember wait what font\ndid I use, what color did I use and\n\n79\n00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:56.260\nthings like that.\n\n80\n00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.760\nThey make it really easy, so\n\n81\n00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.190\nthemes pretty easy to work with and\nagain you got that live preview.\n\n82\n00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.453\nSo you can see what it's gonna look\nlike before you select the one you want.\n\n83\n00:04:06.453 --> 00:04:08.180\nWhich one we want running\na little red there.\n\n84\n00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.180\n>> Sure, but that looks good.\n\n85\n00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.560\n>> That's looks nice, all right.\n\n86\n00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.450\n>> All right, so Mike when we talk\nabout the idea of using themes, right?\n\n87\n00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.020\nAnother thing about this is if you've\ndone this where you've imported in data\n\n88\n00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:23.220\nfrom multiple worksheets in\ndifferent times, different periods.\n\n89\n00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.480\nYou may see that over the time,\nwhere back in 2003,\n\n90\n00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.640\nMike picked the Comic Sans font for\nall of his workbooks.\n\n91\n00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.580\nAnd then maybe a little bit earlier,\nhe even picked that Edwardian font,\n\n92\n00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.980\nthat was really nice and curly.\n\n93\n00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.170\nWell, the theme really allows us to\nbe able to adjust all of that at one\n\n94\n00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.340\ntime as well.\n\n95\n00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.090\nPutting that into a format\nthat's usually fairly modern,\n\n96\n00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.050\nwhich is actually what we want to,\nbut presentable, right?\n\n97\n00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.665\nSo even though we were young and\nwe were, I'm not gonna say ignorant.\n\n98\n00:04:49.665 --> 00:04:52.420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But we were more headstrong in terms of\n\n99\n00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.250\nbeing independent and\nchoosing what we wanted.\n\n100\n00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.040\nWe realize something now,\nthat especially with data, right?\n\n101\n00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.930\nPeople's eyes will start rolling up in\ntheir head as they just see another\n\n102\n00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.450\nboring spreadsheet.\n\n103\n00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.484\nAdding that theme in really does make\nthem focus in and helping them out a lot.\n\n104\n00:05:05.484 --> 00:05:07.660\nAnd then now when you have\nmultiple sources of data,\n\n105\n00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.340\nit helps us to be consistent.\n\n106\n00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.190\nAnd that consistency really does\nshow a professionalism there that\n\n107\n00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.894\nI may not have had back in 2002.\n\n108\n00:05:14.894 --> 00:05:16.840\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] I'm with you there.\n\n109\n00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.634\n[LAUGH] All right,\nkind of continuing on those same lines,\n\n110\n00:05:19.634 --> 00:05:21.869\nI'm gonna show you next\nhow to do a watermark.\n\n111\n00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.180\nWatermarks, I don't use them all that\noften in Excel, I'll be honest with you.\n\n112\n00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.400\nBut we can do them.\n\n113\n00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.200\nUnfortunately, it's not quite like Word,\nright?\n\n114\n00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.430\nAnd if you guys have watched the episodes\nwhere Ronnie walked us through\n\n115\n00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.510\nlearning how to use Word and\nhe showed us watermarks.\n\n116\n00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.650\nI see it a lot in Word documents,\nconfidential or\n\n117\n00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.650\ndraft or eyes only,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n118\n00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.220\nSo if somebody walks around and picks up\nthat hard copy, it says right on there.\n\n119\n00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.530\nDraft, don't send this to the printer,\nit's not the final copy or\n\n120\n00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:51.950\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n121\n00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.850\nExcel, not as much I don't think, and\n\n122\n00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.210\nevidently Microsoft doesn't think so\neither.\n\n123\n00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.590\nBecause they don't have it built into\nhere, but they do call it out on the exam.\n\n124\n00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.970\nSo we're gonna make sure that we show\nyou how to do a watermark in here.\n\n125\n00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.000\nYou really just have to cheat, all right.\n\n126\n00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.960\nWhat we're gonna do is we're gonna\nuse something called WordArt and\n\n127\n00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.490\nwe'll go to Insert.\n\n128\n00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.050\nAnd I'm gonna go to Text and\nthem I'm gonna choose WordArt.\n\n129\n00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.680\nNow WordArt is words that\nare turned into art [LAUGH],\n\n130\n00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.960\nhence the name WordArt, right?\n\n131\n00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.018\nYou can see when I hit that dropdown list,\nIve got a few things I can choose from.\n\n132\n00:06:27.018 --> 00:06:29.860\nIf I'm gonna try to do a watermark,\n\n133\n00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.340\nI'm probably gonna choose one\nof the milder ones, right?\n\n134\n00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:37.000\nI'm not really going for dark colors,\nand patterns, and things like that.\n\n135\n00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.580\nBecause watermarks are not supposed\nto make the data unreadable, right?\n\n136\n00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.730\nThey're supposed to be kind of\nin the background and subtle.\n\n137\n00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.810\nBut you want them to show up if somebody\ntries to print it, or copy it, or\n\n138\n00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:48.930\nsend it or something like that.\n\n139\n00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.730\nSo I'll choose maybe\none of these over here.\n\n140\n00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:55.330\nBut in the end you can adjust any\nof them to work for a watermark.\n\n141\n00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.450\nProbably don't want\nthe reflection one there.\n\n142\n00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.930\nAnd then you put your text, oops and\nI clicked away from it there.\n\n143\n00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.800\nLet me get that again.\n\n144\n00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.060\nI'm gonna put Confidential.\n\n145\n00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.743\nIf I could spell, there we go.\n\n146\n00:07:09.743 --> 00:07:10.868\nHopefully I got that right.\n\n147\n00:07:10.868 --> 00:07:12.445\nAll right, so now I've got this WordArt.\n\n148\n00:07:12.445 --> 00:07:15.000\nNow again, WordArt is art that's words.\n\n149\n00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.750\nWord that's art,\nwhichever way you wanna look at it.\n\n150\n00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.810\nBut it's not like normal text in Excel,\nit doesn't go in a cell.\n\n151\n00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:24.837\nYou'll see it's actually an object\nthat I can move around and\n\n152\n00:07:24.837 --> 00:07:26.550\nI can rotate a little bit.\n\n153\n00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.895\nLike so I can stretch these guys out,\n\n154\n00:07:29.895 --> 00:07:33.055\nI can increase the font size and\nthings like that.\n\n155\n00:07:33.055 --> 00:07:38.725\nAnd what we should do, what they'll\ntell you is I'm going to, if I remember.\n\n156\n00:07:38.725 --> 00:07:42.135\nLet's see, once we've got our word out,\nwe just select it all.\n\n157\n00:07:42.135 --> 00:07:45.465\nText Fill, which is the fill color, right?\n\n158\n00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:49.990\nWhen you look at text, you have the\noutline which is kind of in this case and\n\n159\n00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:51.512\nI'll zoom in here.\n\n160\n00:07:51.512 --> 00:07:54.969\nEvery WordArt it has the outline which in\nthis case is like that bluish gray color\n\n161\n00:07:54.969 --> 00:07:56.582\nand then the fill is actually white.\n\n162\n00:07:56.582 --> 00:08:01.190\nNotice I cannot see my numbers\nbehind this word here.\n\n163\n00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:06.763\nAll right, well that's not gonna work for\na A watermark.\n\n164\n00:08:06.763 --> 00:08:12.430\nSo what I'm gonna do,\nis go to text fill, and choose, no fill.\n\n165\n00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.270\nSo now, when we zoom back in,\n\n166\n00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:17.020\nyou'll see they're actually\nkind of hollow letters, right?\n\n167\n00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.200\nThey've got the outline,\nbut there's no fill colors.\n\n168\n00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.770\nSo I can see the data right through there.\n\n169\n00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:24.380\nNow, it's starting to look a little\nmore like what we would think of\n\n170\n00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.340\nas a watermark.\n\n171\n00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:29.010\nYou can actually go to the outline, and\nyou can choose a lighter color, instead of\n\n172\n00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:33.080\ndark black, cuz that does affect\nthe readability of my numbers back there.\n\n173\n00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:38.765\nMaybe I wanna go with a light grey color,\nthat doesn't affect the data so much.\n\n174\n00:08:38.765 --> 00:08:41.870\nAnd you can pick whichever\none you wanted there.\n\n175\n00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:44.980\nAnd you can rotate it around.\n\n176\n00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.012\nOops.\n\n177\n00:08:46.012 --> 00:08:48.600\nIn trouble with my toucpad here.\n\n178\n00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.500\nAnd somehow, I moved the L to the end.\n\n179\n00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.055\nThere we go, we'll stretch that back out.\n\n180\n00:08:54.055 --> 00:08:55.350\nYou can move it.\n\n181\n00:08:55.350 --> 00:09:00.100\nNotice if I get to the border of the word,\nart, I get this four way arrow.\n\n182\n00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.790\nSo I can drag it around, and move it\nto wherever I need to put this guy.\n\n183\n00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.680\nMaybe I want to rotate it a little more.\n\n184\n00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:13.290\nNow the only thing here, is stretching\nthis doesn't really change my font,\n\n185\n00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.980\nI still need to go in,\nand change my font size.\n\n186\n00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:19.070\nThe box itself is bigger,\nbut the text isn't.\n\n187\n00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:22.290\nSo, I can come in here,\nand change that font size.\n\n188\n00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:25.830\nAnd get what,\nwould almost pass as a watermark.\n\n189\n00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:29.080\nSo, that's what they want us to do.\n\n190\n00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.510\nOr that's one of\nthe easiest ways to do it.\n\n191\n00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:34.680\nAnother way to do it,\nis actually put it in the header.\n\n192\n00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:39.100\nAnd make the image big enough, to where\nit's gonna roll out of the header, and\n\n193\n00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.480\nacross the rest of the document.\n\n194\n00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.890\nUse your same techniques,\n\n195\n00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:46.450\nto make it transparent or, thinner color,\nlighter colors, and things like that.\n\n196\n00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:49.750\nIn fact, we really need to take\na look at headers and footers, so\n\n197\n00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:50.910\nwhy don't we do that next.\n\n198\n00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:54.229\nSo there's your,\nkind of makeshift watermark.\n\n199\n00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:59.450\nHeaders and footers, a header is something\nthat appears at the top of the page,\n\n200\n00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:01.270\na footer appears at the bottom.\n\n201\n00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:05.080\nTypically we're talking about, if it's\na multi-page document, once on that first\n\n202\n00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:09.745\npage, right at the top of the first page,\nonce at the end of the last page.\n\n203\n00:10:09.745 --> 00:10:14.970\nAnd we get there by going\nto our insert ribbon.\n\n204\n00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:17.070\nAnd then over to text.\n\n205\n00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:19.170\nAnd then header & footer, right?\n\n206\n00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:21.660\nIn Excel they're hidden by default.\n\n207\n00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:22.680\nYou don't see the headers.\n\n208\n00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.310\nYou don't see the footers here.\n\n209\n00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:28.110\nAnd these are actually going\nto repeat on all of my pages,\n\n210\n00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:31.900\nunlike, like a word Document, when I think\nof header, I think of the very first page.\n\n211\n00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.140\nAnd the very last page, for the footer,\nalthough you can repeat it.\n\n212\n00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:36.360\nI know Ronnie taught us how to do that.\n\n213\n00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.435\nBut here you can see header and\nfooter appears on each page.\n\n214\n00:10:39.435 --> 00:10:40.690\nAll right?\n\n215\n00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.640\nSo it's broken my document\nup in these different pages.\n\n216\n00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.320\nAnd I can now see the header.\n\n217\n00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.510\nAnd the header is divided\nup into three sections.\n\n218\n00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:51.000\nYour left section there is left aligned.\n\n219\n00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.840\nSo anything I type here.\n\n220\n00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:56.960\nAnd I can't type, and talk at\nthe same time, and spell correctly.\n\n221\n00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.810\nWe'll say January 27, 2016.\n\n222\n00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:04.350\nOver there it's going to be left aligned.\n\n223\n00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:09.400\nAnything I put in here,\nwe'll say orders for 2016,\n\n224\n00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:15.660\nfirst half, or something like that,\nis going to be centered aligned.\n\n225\n00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:21.030\nAnything I put over here is going\nto be right aligned, all right.\n\n226\n00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:24.860\nSo each one of those boxes,\nleft aligned, centered, right aligned.\n\n227\n00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:25.705\nYou don't have to use them all.\n\n228\n00:11:25.705 --> 00:11:26.590\nRight?\nI could've just\n\n229\n00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:29.740\ndone something in the middle box,\nand left it alone.\n\n230\n00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:33.650\nBut now you'll see on the other pages,\nthat those headers appear there, right?\n\n231\n00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:35.930\nThere's my January, my date, and that.\n\n232\n00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:39.200\nNow, if I wanna work with the footer,\neasiest way to do that,\n\n233\n00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:46.910\nis to go back over to my insert,\nand my text header and footer.\n\n234\n00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:48.520\nAnd I guess, I did already have that open.\n\n235\n00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:49.670\nI wasn't paying attention.\n\n236\n00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.420\nIn here,\nthis one of those contextual ribbons,\n\n237\n00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.310\nit only shows up, while you're\nworking with headers and footers.\n\n238\n00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.860\nAnd now, I can switch between\nwith this navigation area,\n\n239\n00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.730\ngo to header, go to footer.\n\n240\n00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:02.840\nI will tell you, that I've tried\nto scroll down to it before.\n\n241\n00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:07.440\nAnd you can, it will let you,\nbut it gets, I don't know.\n\n242\n00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.340\nSometimes it's worked for\nme sometimes it hasn't.\n\n243\n00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:14.280\nI would just go ahead and use You'll\nnotice my contextual ribbon went away.\n\n244\n00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.340\nNow, if I click back in there,\nthere's my contextual ribbon.\n\n245\n00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:21.180\nJust use the go to footer, and\nit takes you right down to it.\n\n246\n00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:27.093\nFooters again, the bottom of every page,\nand same thing, left-aligned, centered,\n\n247\n00:12:27.093 --> 00:12:28.390\nright-aligned.\n\n248\n00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:32.200\nNow, other than just typing in text, like\nI did on the header, there's also a bunch\n\n249\n00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:36.440\nof pre-built information that I can\ndump into these headers and footers.\n\n250\n00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:40.460\nAnd I really like these guys,\ncuz they can be dynamic.\n\n251\n00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:43.660\nYou can do current time.\n\n252\n00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.770\nLet's say, I want to know when\nsomebody prints this spreadsheet out,\n\n253\n00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:51.420\nit's got numbers that change every hour,\nmaybe it's a sales quotes, or\n\n254\n00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.850\nstock ticker prices,\nor something like that.\n\n255\n00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:55.660\nSomething is a little dynamic and so\n\n256\n00:12:55.660 --> 00:13:00.050\nif I've got a hard copy of it,\nI need to know when that was printed out.\n\n257\n00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:03.630\nSo I know if those are current numbers or\nif those are dated numbers, right?\n\n258\n00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:06.790\nSo I don't wanna have to change\nthe date every time I print it.\n\n259\n00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:10.660\nI can just come up here and say, okay\nput the current date right there, right?\n\n260\n00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:16.410\nAnd those that put in an ampersand,\nopen bracket, date, close bracket.\n\n261\n00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:20.200\nI can put a space in there,\nmaybe a dash, and another space.\n\n262\n00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.340\nAnd I can go back up and\ninsert current time, right?\n\n263\n00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.810\nSo you see all these different\nthings that I could do.\n\n264\n00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:27.260\nPage number, number of pages.\n\n265\n00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:28.930\nThis is a great one here.\n\n266\n00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:34.670\nI can type in the word page,\nspace, click page number,\n\n267\n00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:40.320\nspace, of, space,\nnumber of pages, all right?\n\n268\n00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.460\nSo I've combined static text\nwith these pre-built little\n\n269\n00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:48.040\nclippets that I can insert into there and\nnow it's gonna come out dynamically.\n\n270\n00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:52.360\nIf there's 10 pages, and I'm on page 2,\nit's gonna say page 2 of 10.\n\n271\n00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:56.890\nIf I insert 5 more pages, it'll say page\n2 of 15, it'll automatically adjust.\n\n272\n00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:59.120\nI don't have to go and manually do that.\n\n273\n00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.690\nThere's file paths, file names.\n\n274\n00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:04.560\nIf I go over here to footer,\nthere's a drop down list of some pre-built\n\n275\n00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.740\nones as well, where you can do,\nyou can see the different ones here.\n\n276\n00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:11.150\nPage numbers, confidential.\n\n277\n00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.695\nSo lots of cool things you can do\nwith these headers and footers.\n\n278\n00:14:13.695 --> 00:14:17.430\nAnd if we wanna look at them, I'll jump\nout of here, and, go ahead, Ronny.\n\n279\n00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:19.220\n>> Yeah, when you take a look at this for\na moment,\n\n280\n00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.630\nthe key here is what Mike is showing you.\n\n281\n00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:25.790\nIt's that wherever it lands you to be able\nto edit those, only edit on that one page.\n\n282\n00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:29.430\nYou'll notice that around on the other\nsheets there, it's really reporting to,\n\n283\n00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:31.240\nlike a print preview, right?\n\n284\n00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.830\nWhat is actually on the page header and\nwhat is on the page footer.\n\n285\n00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:38.350\nIt's real easy, if you're doing like\nMike does, and like I do sometimes.\n\n286\n00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:40.330\nAs you're sitting there, and\nyou're just examining, and\n\n287\n00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:41.670\nall of a sudden you\nwanna make a correction.\n\n288\n00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:45.180\nAnd then you try, and make a correction\non that page that you're examining.\n\n289\n00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:46.280\nAnd then you're wondering why?\n\n290\n00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.500\nYou get frustrated.\n\n291\n00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:50.660\nSo always go back to that initial\nfirst page that it lands you on,\n\n292\n00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:53.000\nto make any editing and any adjustments,\n\n293\n00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.240\nif you don't like the way that the page\nheader or page footer appears.\n\n294\n00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.530\nNow the nice thing I like about using\nthese, regardless of whether we're\n\n295\n00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:03.580\ntalking about Excel spreadsheet, or\na Word document, whatever it is.\n\n296\n00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:07.360\nBut with sheets like this, like the data,\nif you start looking through all those\n\n297\n00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:12.190\npages, the data from top to bottom of\neach page almost looks identical, right?\n\n298\n00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:16.440\nSo if you were to show me data from\npage three versus data from page ten,\n\n299\n00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.990\nI might not know.\n\n300\n00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:19.230\nBut with those page headers,\n\n301\n00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:22.740\nI can at least if I happened to walk\ndown the hall and drop the whole thing,\n\n302\n00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.859\nI can use the page header-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n303\n00:15:24.859 --> 00:15:26.780\n>> And page footer information to re-sort\n\n304\n00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:28.830\nthem, and put them back into the same one.\n\n305\n00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:32.170\nWithout that, it's just about\nimpossible for me to do that.\n\n306\n00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:35.010\nIf I have my glasses,\nit's still probably impossible.\n\n307\n00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:37.680\nBut with those numbers,\nit will at least help me out there and\n\n308\n00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.505\nthat's where I effectively would use this.\n\n309\n00:15:39.505 --> 00:15:40.385\n>> Absolutely, I like that.\n\n310\n00:15:40.385 --> 00:15:42.290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> When you drop that whole stack\n\n311\n00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:44.050\nyou gotta get them back in\nthe right order, right?\n\n312\n00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:45.010\n>> Definitely true.\n\n313\n00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:50.230\nAll right, so I go back out to my normal\nview, notice it automatically switched me\n\n314\n00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:53.350\nto what they call the page layout for\nyou to work with the headers and footers.\n\n315\n00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:58.090\nWhen I'm done with my header and footer, I\ncan simply switch back to my normal view.\n\n316\n00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:00.573\nHeaders and footers are not\ndisplayed on the normal view.\n\n317\n00:16:00.573 --> 00:16:04.416\nIf we do go to look at the print preview,\nhowever, I'll go to print.\n\n318\n00:16:04.416 --> 00:16:07.236\nHere I can see my watermark that I've got.\n\n319\n00:16:07.236 --> 00:16:09.780\nAnd I can see, and I'll zoom in here.\n\n320\n00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.402\nYou can see that header and\n\n321\n00:16:11.402 --> 00:16:15.030\nfooter that's going to appear\non each one of those pages.\n\n322\n00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:21.050\nNow you can see page 1 of 12, and\nif I go out to the next page it should\n\n323\n00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:26.390\nsay 2 of 12 and the current date and\ntime when I chose to print this guy.\n\n324\n00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:28.720\nAll right?\nI really should flip that landscape.\n\n325\n00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.690\nIt's not looking very good there so.\n\n326\n00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:34.560\nAll right, so that's headers and\nfooters and doing watermarks.\n\n327\n00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:37.158\nNext thing, we want to talk\nabout is kind of changing gears.\n\n328\n00:16:37.158 --> 00:16:41.780\nYou know Microsoft loves to group their\nobjectives into meaningful sections.\n\n329\n00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:42.530\nI'm kidding.\n\n330\n00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:46.470\nBeing sarcastic, and that is\nsomething known as data validation.\n\n331\n00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:51.490\nData validation is a way\nthat we can validate data.\n\n332\n00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:54.430\nI love those kind of definitions, right?\n\n333\n00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:57.404\nYou're like thanks Mike,\nyou really helped me out there.\n\n334\n00:16:57.404 --> 00:17:00.310\n[LAUGH]\nSo\n\n335\n00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:02.700\nlet me explain it a little bit more,\nright?\n\n336\n00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:07.120\nWe want to make sure that the data\nfalls within certain ranges or\n\n337\n00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.500\nis valid is really what\nyou're trying to say.\n\n338\n00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.480\nFor example, I've got on my spreadsheet\nI've got a quantity column.\n\n339\n00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.582\nWell what if somebody tried to put\nin a negative number into that\n\n340\n00:17:15.582 --> 00:17:17.570\nquantity goal, right.\n\n341\n00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:18.472\nThey could do it.\n\n342\n00:17:18.472 --> 00:17:20.942\nI mean it would let them put\na negative one in there, but\n\n343\n00:17:20.942 --> 00:17:22.143\nhow is that a valid order.\n\n344\n00:17:22.143 --> 00:17:24.501\nHow am I gonna sell somebody negative one.\n\n345\n00:17:24.501 --> 00:17:28.866\nWhat's it gonna do to any formulas that\nare multiplying quantity by unit price to\n\n346\n00:17:28.866 --> 00:17:32.522\ncome up with a total for that order\nto put in the purchase number, and\n\n347\n00:17:32.522 --> 00:17:35.153\nthe negative number is\ngonna make a negative, so\n\n348\n00:17:35.153 --> 00:17:39.740\nnow I owe this company money for not\nbuying negative one of my products, right.\n\n349\n00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.520\nThings like that could happen, right?\n\n350\n00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:45.670\nOr if you end up dividing by zero and\nit throws errors all over your worksheet.\n\n351\n00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:47.490\nSo, making sure that data is valid,\n\n352\n00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:50.800\nmaking sure that it's input, cuz a lot\nof times, we make these worksheets and\n\n353\n00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:54.210\nthese workbooks, and then somebody\nelse uses them on a daily basis.\n\n354\n00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:59.780\nThey're responsible for\ninserting that data in there, and\n\n355\n00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:04.950\nwe wanna try to make it to where we\ndon't have to go back and fix things.\n\n356\n00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:09.440\nThat instead of letting them put in\nerroneous data, and then later on seeing\n\n357\n00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:12.115\nthe formulas failed and trying to figure\nit out, and go back and fix the data.\n\n358\n00:18:12.115 --> 00:18:13.745\nHow about we prevent them?\n\n359\n00:18:13.745 --> 00:18:16.165\nIt's not like they're doing\nit on purpose most likely.\n\n360\n00:18:16.165 --> 00:18:19.995\nThey just accidentally hit the minus\nkey before they hit the number, right?\n\n361\n00:18:19.995 --> 00:18:22.907\nOr they put some other information.\n\n362\n00:18:22.907 --> 00:18:28.062\nPut 2013 instead of 2016 for a date,\nand we can't sell stuff in the past.\n\n363\n00:18:28.062 --> 00:18:32.852\nSo by setting up this data validation\nwe can help control that data input and\n\n364\n00:18:32.852 --> 00:18:36.622\nmake sure its done correctly\nbefore it causes problems.\n\n365\n00:18:36.622 --> 00:18:39.842\nSo let's take a look\nat how we can do that.\n\n366\n00:18:39.842 --> 00:18:44.438\n>> Now Mike, where I'm actually\nseeing this data validation for\n\n367\n00:18:44.438 --> 00:18:49.830\nthe input here is really helpful is a lot\nof times people have certain abbreviations\n\n368\n00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:54.830\nthat they end up using that may not\nbe standard, but that actually lends\n\n369\n00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:58.830\nitself to then when you go back and\ntry and search for rows of data, right?\n\n370\n00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:01.710\nRows and rows of data here, and\nall of a sudden you now start\n\n371\n00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:06.290\nseeing different abbreviations for things\nthat should be standardized at some point.\n\n372\n00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:09.910\nUsing that data validation input\nallows then Mike to set that, and\n\n373\n00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:11.580\nthen that way he can actually say no,\n\n374\n00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.270\nyou're not supposed to do that\njust like the negative numbers.\n\n375\n00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:17.910\nSo for example, right here in\nthe United States we live in Florida.\n\n376\n00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:20.050\nWell, the US postal code is FL, right?\n\n377\n00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:25.620\nAnd everybody will actually print that\ndifferent like capital F lowercase l,\n\n378\n00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:29.775\nand then there's always capital F and\ncapital L, and then there's Flaa.\n\n379\n00:19:29.775 --> 00:19:32.540\nF-L-A-A, and you name it and\n\n380\n00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:36.010\nso we're actually having to search for\nall that data.\n\n381\n00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:39.360\nDoing something like this will really\nhelp as somebody tries to input that data\n\n382\n00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.720\nwrongly it actually gives us\nthat ability to stop, and\n\n383\n00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:46.050\nMike's example really does\nwork in terms of numbers, but\n\n384\n00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:48.940\nyou can see that it can actually\nbe more than the numbers there and\n\n385\n00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:51.720\nthis is a really effective tool for\nus and we'll take advantage of it.\n\n386\n00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.990\n>> It really is and that's a great point.\n\n387\n00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:57.920\nMaking sure data is consistent is\nanother key to data validation.\n\n388\n00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:58.635\nWell how do we do it?\n\n389\n00:19:58.635 --> 00:20:01.085\nWell, we go over to the data ribbon, and\n\n390\n00:20:01.085 --> 00:20:04.605\nwe have in our data tools\nI have data validation.\n\n391\n00:20:04.605 --> 00:20:07.745\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna grab\nthis column with the quantity in there,\n\n392\n00:20:07.745 --> 00:20:11.325\nand I know I've got some number that\nare less than ten, so just for an example,\n\n393\n00:20:11.325 --> 00:20:15.815\nso we have something to see I'm gonna\nsay that the quantity has to be ten.\n\n394\n00:20:15.815 --> 00:20:19.097\nMaybe we got a minimum\npurchase order of ten units.\n\n395\n00:20:19.097 --> 00:20:21.325\nWe don't do anything less than that.\n\n396\n00:20:21.325 --> 00:20:23.460\nSo I can come in here to data validation.\n\n397\n00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:28.010\nHit my little drop down list and\nchoose data validation, all right?\n\n398\n00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:33.020\nAnd what I'm gonna do is on my settings\nallow any value, whole number,\n\n399\n00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:34.680\ndecimal, list, right?\n\n400\n00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.610\nWe're talking about words for\nwhat Ronnie was saying.\n\n401\n00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:40.270\nYou might make a list of the different\nstates you do business with and what their\n\n402\n00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:44.810\nabbreviations are, and if they try to put\nFLA it's gonna say that's not on the list.\n\n403\n00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:46.150\nIt's gotta be FL.\n\n404\n00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:47.455\nDate, time, text, link.\n\n405\n00:20:47.455 --> 00:20:49.560\nMaybe you just want to\nlimit it to two characters,\n\n406\n00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.020\nthen they can't put that A in there,\nright.\n\n407\n00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:55.240\nYou can do custom, so you can\nreally do some neat things in here.\n\n408\n00:20:55.240 --> 00:21:01.200\nI'm gonna do a whole number, and then\nwhen I choose whole number I get between,\n\n409\n00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.700\nnot between, equal, greater than,\nless than, all kinds of options.\n\n410\n00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:08.500\nI'm gonna say greater than,\nor actually for\n\n411\n00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.130\nthis one let's do greater than or\nequal to.\n\n412\n00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:16.120\nIf I did greater than my\nscenario as a ten or more, so\n\n413\n00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:18.830\nif I do greater than I have to\nsay greater than nine, right?\n\n414\n00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:25.070\nOr if I say greater than or equal to I can\nnow put the number 10 here, all right?\n\n415\n00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:28.380\nSo I'll put minimum 10, and\nI'll go ahead and click.\n\n416\n00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:29.690\nWell let me go through the other options.\n\n417\n00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:31.700\nYou also have input messages.\n\n418\n00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:32.930\nIf you're gonna go ahead and\n\n419\n00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:36.670\nif you're gonna do data validation what's\ngonna happen is it will prevent them from\n\n420\n00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:41.150\nentering bad information, but\nwe want to be nice to our end users.\n\n421\n00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:42.720\nYou guys have done this before.\n\n422\n00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.190\nYou've been to a form on the web or\nsomething like that.\n\n423\n00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:48.000\nYou've inserted data or\ntried to hit tab and\n\n424\n00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.110\nit just beeps at you, or\nthe cursor just sits there and flashes?\n\n425\n00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:53.739\nYou don't know what's wrong, right?\n\n426\n00:21:53.739 --> 00:21:55.875\nWe want to give them a message hey,\nlike this.\n\n427\n00:21:55.875 --> 00:21:59.455\nLet me put invalid data,\n\n428\n00:21:59.455 --> 00:22:04.235\noops, and I'm a little too OCD.\n\n429\n00:22:04.235 --> 00:22:05.535\nI cannot let that pass,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n430\n00:22:05.535 --> 00:22:06.116\n>> We'll change that there.\n\n431\n00:22:06.116 --> 00:22:11.027\nInvalid data must be 10 or\n\n432\n00:22:11.027 --> 00:22:15.088\ngreater, all right?\n\n433\n00:22:15.088 --> 00:22:17.370\nOr let's say quantity.\n\n434\n00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:23.120\nI mean,\nyou want to be relatively explanative.\n\n435\n00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:23.753\n>> Explanative, am I making up words now?\n\n436\n00:22:23.753 --> 00:22:25.141\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You wanna make\n\n437\n00:22:25.141 --> 00:22:26.750\nsure you explain yourself, right?\n\n438\n00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:28.110\nThat way they're not frustrated.\n\n439\n00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:31.290\nThey go I forgot I can't insert eight, and\n\n440\n00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:34.230\nso they can call the customer back and\nsay hey look, do you want ten?\n\n441\n00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:37.490\nOr if it was just a typo they're like\nyeah, it has to be greater than ten.\n\n442\n00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:40.120\nIf I don't tell them anything\nthey're left wondering\n\n443\n00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:42.210\nwhy can't I put the number five in there?\n\n444\n00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:43.660\nAnd guess what that means?\n\n445\n00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:44.860\nA call to the help desk,\n\n446\n00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.300\nwhich then means a call to you if you're\nthe one that created the workbook,\n\n447\n00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:51.450\nand you could have avoided all that by\njust popping a little message up in there.\n\n448\n00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:52.910\nError alert.\n\n449\n00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:56.770\nI can choose stop, and this is most\nof the time what you want to do.\n\n450\n00:22:56.770 --> 00:23:00.820\nThis is going to say you can not enter\nanything that violates that rule.\n\n451\n00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:03.660\nYou might have a scenario where\nyou'll let him do that, but\n\n452\n00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:06.760\nyou want to make sure\nthey meant to do that.\n\n453\n00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:12.560\nMaybe we say certain customers can't order\nless than ten, so maybe I do a warning.\n\n454\n00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:15.140\nWhat that's gonna do is still\npop up the message, but\n\n455\n00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:18.760\nallow them to enter that value\nthat violates the rules anyway.\n\n456\n00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:23.240\nInformation again, we'll let them\nenter the information as well, and\n\n457\n00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:27.540\nit's just gonna give them a friendlier\nicon whereas with stop you\n\n458\n00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:31.190\nget a big fat x, and that lets\nyou know hey, something is wrong.\n\n459\n00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:32.470\nRight?\n\n460\n00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:36.730\nSo I get all that set up and\nI choose okay, all right.\n\n461\n00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:41.230\nAnd now, as I go through, and this is one\nof the reasons some people don't like\n\n462\n00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:45.480\nthat message and it bugs me and\nI wish Microsoft would fix this.\n\n463\n00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:49.210\nNotice how my message\nshows up all the time?\n\n464\n00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:51.780\nAll right,\nall I'm doing is selecting the cells.\n\n465\n00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:54.300\nSo what I like to do,\nand I forgot about that.\n\n466\n00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:56.780\nIt's been awhile since I've\ndone a little data validation\n\n467\n00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:59.820\nis I might turn off the input message,\nright.\n\n468\n00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:04.626\nIf this was a form where you're tabbing\nthrough boxes I might want to put\n\n469\n00:24:04.626 --> 00:24:06.239\nthat message up there.\n\n470\n00:24:06.239 --> 00:24:10.064\nIn this case with a spreadsheet like this\nit gets in the way of my other numbers, so\n\n471\n00:24:10.064 --> 00:24:12.277\nI probably won't show\na message on the input.\n\n472\n00:24:12.277 --> 00:24:16.362\nBut I will still show\na message on the error.\n\n473\n00:24:16.362 --> 00:24:20.280\nAnd I could put the same thing here\nin fact, cuz I'm a lazy typer.\n\n474\n00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:21.884\nHow about we just do this?\n\n475\n00:24:26.239 --> 00:24:29.310\nThen we'll say warning Will Robinson.\n\n476\n00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:31.530\nRight.\n\n477\n00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:33.230\nAnd hen we'll click OK, all right.\n\n478\n00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:35.310\nSo now I still get that message.\n\n479\n00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:36.820\nI thought I did away with that.\n\n480\n00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:40.480\nAnyway, so\nthat message is a little bit annoying.\n\n481\n00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.440\nWe'll uncheck that.\n\n482\n00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.740\nDid I not save it?\n\n483\n00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:46.310\nWow.\nWe'll try that one more time.\n\n484\n00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:50.300\nWe will copy this, paste that over here.\n\n485\n00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:55.557\nWe'll call this an error and\nwe'll go back over here and\n\n486\n00:24:55.557 --> 00:24:58.386\nuncheck that and make sure we click OK.\n\n487\n00:25:00.256 --> 00:25:02.575\nAnd it's not saving my changes for\nsome reason.\n\n488\n00:25:02.575 --> 00:25:04.630\nIt's leaving that on there.\n\n489\n00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:06.650\nThat's all right,\nwell not too worried about it.\n\n490\n00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:09.710\nYeah it wants to throw\nthat message up there.\n\n491\n00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:13.140\nI'll have to check, that's probably a\nglitch on my little virtual machine here,\n\n492\n00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:14.510\nbut you see the different options.\n\n493\n00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:16.140\nAll right, now what can we do with this?\n\n494\n00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:19.380\nNotice I still have numbers\nthat violate that rule.\n\n495\n00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:23.690\nAny data that's already been entered\nis not gonna be subject to that, right.\n\n496\n00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:27.230\nIt's not gonna go back and\nundo or remove information.\n\n497\n00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:32.307\nBut if I try to insert new information,\nAnd\n\n498\n00:25:32.307 --> 00:25:37.326\nI do a number like 12, that's allowed, if\nI do a number like two it's gonna say that\n\n499\n00:25:37.326 --> 00:25:42.150\nvalue does not much the data validation\nrestriction defined for this cell.\n\n500\n00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:43.420\nAnd I get my custom message.\n\n501\n00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:45.270\nAnd it says retry and I can go back and\n\n502\n00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:47.996\nmake it to something,\nI meant to put 12 not two.\n\n503\n00:25:47.996 --> 00:25:49.910\nAll right and it allows it.\n\n504\n00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:52.597\nIf I would have done informational,\n\n505\n00:25:52.597 --> 00:25:56.680\nit would allow me to chose OK\nto insert that data anyway.\n\n506\n00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:01.590\nAll right, and other things we can\ndo with this is like in this case.\n\n507\n00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:04.690\nI didn't realize I needed to do that\nvalidation until after the fact.\n\n508\n00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:06.460\nI've already got a lot of data in there.\n\n509\n00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:08.340\nI might have some invalid data.\n\n510\n00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:09.340\nWhat do we do?\n\n511\n00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:13.740\nWell, I can go back to data validation and\nchoose Circle Invalid Data.\n\n512\n00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:17.410\nAnd now it'll let me find, and\nthere we go, it takes it a second.\n\n513\n00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:19.640\nNotice I've got these\nnice red circles on here.\n\n514\n00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:23.210\nAnd it's showing me all of\nthe places that violate my rule.\n\n515\n00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:25.877\nSo, now I can go back and\nI can make changes to that, all right?\n\n516\n00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:28.610\nAnd then once I change it so\n\n517\n00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:31.660\nit doesn't violate it anymore,\nnotice my circle goes away.\n\n518\n00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:32.995\nSo, it gives me this really quick and\n\n519\n00:26:32.995 --> 00:26:36.120\nthat's extremely handy when\nyou've got thousands of rows.\n\n520\n00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:39.110\nThat you've gotta find the errors then,\nare any place in that\n\n521\n00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:43.920\ndata is not following the rules,\nthat's a wonderful little option there.\n\n522\n00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:47.750\nThen when I'm done fixing anything I\ncould clear the validation circles.\n\n523\n00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:49.940\nIf I wanted to leave some of those and\n\n524\n00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:53.210\nnot fix them,\njust clear your validation circles.\n\n525\n00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:55.360\nOther things I wanna point\nout about data validation is,\n\n526\n00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.700\nyou can search for it as well.\n\n527\n00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:00.420\nHow do I know if there's any\ndata validation being done?\n\n528\n00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:04.368\nOther then those annoying messages\nthat I cannot make go away.\n\n529\n00:27:04.368 --> 00:27:09.340\n[LAUGH] Well you can actually do\na find and select and data validation.\n\n530\n00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:13.850\nAll right, and it says hey,\nthere is data validation on this column.\n\n531\n00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:15.830\nAll right, so I like that.\n\n532\n00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:18.280\nThe other think you might wanna\nbe able to do is get rid of it.\n\n533\n00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:20.360\nMaybe if somebody puts\nsome data validation and\n\n534\n00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:21.718\nnow we're okay with selling.\n\n535\n00:27:21.718 --> 00:27:27.020\nWe can now break those boxes down and\nwe can sell less than ten units.\n\n536\n00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:28.890\nSo, I need to get rid of that validation.\n\n537\n00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:31.600\nSo, all we have to do is\ngo to data validation and\n\n538\n00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.020\npull the validation rule back up.\n\n539\n00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:37.110\nAnd then at the bottom of that\nthere's this clear all, and\n\n540\n00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:39.540\nthat will remove all of my\nyou can see in settings,\n\n541\n00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:41.860\neverything's gone back\nto the default there.\n\n542\n00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:42.370\nI click OK.\n\n543\n00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:47.230\nAnd now if I do circle validation\ninvalid data, nothing happens\n\n544\n00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:51.922\nbecause I've removed, well we thought I\nremoved, we'll try that one more time.\n\n545\n00:27:51.922 --> 00:27:55.108\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Data Validation, Clear All, OK.\n\n546\n00:27:55.108 --> 00:27:57.936\nAnd it's kinda working and grinding there.\n\n547\n00:28:02.464 --> 00:28:05.200\nYeah I think my validation\nis gone it was just leaving.\n\n548\n00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.080\nMy message is still popping up.\n\n549\n00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.260\n>> Yeah.\n>> Let's try that again.\n\n550\n00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:08.870\n>> It's still there.\n\n551\n00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:12.975\n>> You know what I think I'm doing\nI'm clearing it off of one cell.\n\n552\n00:28:12.975 --> 00:28:14.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I didn't have the entire column\n\n553\n00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:15.810\nselected so\n\n554\n00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:19.670\nwhatever cell I selected it was clearing\noff that it was still on the other cells.\n\n555\n00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:21.420\nSo let me do the entire column.\n\n556\n00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:26.120\nGo back in my data validation rule and I'm\ngonna erase current settings to continue,\n\n557\n00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:28.505\ncuz now the problem is some\nof the cells have them.\n\n558\n00:28:28.505 --> 00:28:30.150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Tnd some of it doesn't.\n\n559\n00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:32.300\nSo it's like hey do you\nwant to start all over?\n\n560\n00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:36.845\nBut the same concept would apply you\nwould select that column clear all,\n\n561\n00:28:36.845 --> 00:28:40.900\nOK and that will remove the data\nvalidation from that entire column.\n\n562\n00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:41.600\nAll right, so\n\n563\n00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.660\njust, actually a good learning point\n>> Yeah.\n\n564\n00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:47.850\n>> You can clear a validation off of\nindividual cells or off the entire column.\n\n565\n00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:50.640\nSo by the way,\nwe get rid of that data validation.\n\n566\n00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:51.490\n>> All right, Mike.\n\n567\n00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:52.940\nIn terms of formatting,\n\n568\n00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:56.160\nwe've actually covered a lot of different\nthings in this particular episode.\n\n569\n00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.110\nWe took a look at headers and footers.\n\n570\n00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:59.930\nWe talked about watermarks.\n\n571\n00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:03.390\nLet's see, we also then talked\nabout data validation and\n\n572\n00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:06.100\nthen we covered some themes, I believe.\n\n573\n00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:09.580\n>> Yeah, we did themes and inserting\nrows and columns and widths and heights\n\n574\n00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:12.460\n>> So remember that a lot of times you may\n\n575\n00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:15.200\nthink that hey this is not\nworth the time and effort.\n\n576\n00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.060\nBut it really is.\n\n577\n00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:19.720\nAt least learning the basics here will\nhelp you to present that data better,\n\n578\n00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:23.720\nespecially when you do need to present it\nto colleagues or even to superiors here.\n\n579\n00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:28.070\nPutting it in the right format is really a\nbig help that will show that you actually\n\n580\n00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:30.450\ntook the time as a professional\nto learn how to do this.\n\n581\n00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:33.270\n>> And it's really gonna help you to\nmake the point that you want to make.\n\n582\n00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:37.560\nMike, any final words for somebody\njust really learning how to do this?\n\n583\n00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.350\n>> Try not to get thrown by those\ndarn data validation things, right?\n\n584\n00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:42.495\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Make sure you select the entire column\n\n585\n00:29:42.495 --> 00:29:43.970\nif that's what you want to do.\n\n586\n00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:46.120\nNo, just get in there and\nplay with it, right?\n\n587\n00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.670\nMake it look good,\nas I said you eat with your eyes.\n\n588\n00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:50.970\nSame thing with my data,\nyou want it to look professional.\n\n589\n00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:52.010\nYou want to impress.\n\n590\n00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:55.280\nNot that you're trying to impress people\nbut you don't want to look sloppy.\n\n591\n00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:59.920\nAnd Excel makes it extremely easy to\nslap a little formatting on there.\n\n592\n00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.890\nHeck you can go to galleries and\npick themes and\n\n593\n00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:03.940\nmake it look like you spent hours on that.\n\n594\n00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:07.170\nYou can go then boss this took me forever.\n\n595\n00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:10.820\nAnd really it was just a click, click and\nyou're done and it looked beautiful.\n\n596\n00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:12.590\nRight, so take advantage.\n\n597\n00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:14.320\nAll right, well that's a great place for\n\n598\n00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:16.730\nus to go ahead and\nwrap up this episode then.\n\n599\n00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:19.350\nSigning off for

They talk about show us the benefits of hiding column, roles and even worksheets.  Also reminding us that this is not a security feature but can help when needing to only display or print certain columns of a worksheet without displaying everything.  When working with large worksheets, using split view and freeze panes can help keep track of data easier, according to Mike and Ronnie.  They also show where to effect the workbook properties to make it easier to find the workbook without having to examine the contents",

00:00:18.240\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and today,\n\n4\n00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.130\nwe're going to be taking a look\nat Microsoft Excel 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.080\nNow, we're dealing with it from usually\na standpoint of a default install.\n\n6\n00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.250\nBut a lot of times,\nwhat ends up happening of course,\n\n7\n00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.860\nis that you want to see more than\nwhat's actually presented default.\n\n8\n00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.330\nAnd we're actually talking about now,\n\n9\n00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.130\ncustomizing the way that we can\nalso deal with Excel as well.\n\n10\n00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.830\nAnd here to help us is gonna be,\nwell Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.680\nMike why in the world do we want\nto customize what we're actually\n\n12\n00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.230\ntaking a look at and\nnot leave it at it's default?\n\n13\n00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.062\n>> Cuz who wants to be\nthe same as everybody else?\n\n14\n00:00:47.062 --> 00:00:47.802\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n15\n00:00:47.802 --> 00:00:48.756\nWe gotta be different.\n\n16\n00:00:48.756 --> 00:00:49.733\nThat's what's cool.\n\n17\n00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:53.700\nNo, there are some times when you want to\nchange that default behavior on Excel,\n\n18\n00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.740\neither because of functionality or\nfor some business requirements.\n\n19\n00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.710\nSo, several reasons.\n\n20\n00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.650\nAnd we're gonna take a look at a few\nof the things that I can do within my\n\n21\n00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.020\nworkbook to change the way I see things.\n\n22\n00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.840\nWhen we open up a workbook, and\nI've got one opened up here on my screen,\n\n23\n00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.760\nI've got several tabs across there.\n\n24\n00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.100\nAnd if I send Ronnie this workbook, or\n\n25\n00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.240\nevery time I open this workbook,\nI see all of these tabs.\n\n26\n00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.920\nI've got a tab for each one of my months\nfor the first half of the year here,\n\n27\n00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.460\nwith some sales figures or\nsales information on there.\n\n28\n00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.820\nI've also got a tab up at\nthe beginning that has some summary.\n\n29\n00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.610\nAnd I didn't go back and\nwrite the entire formula but\n\n30\n00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.870\nit's pulling from at\nleast the January sheet.\n\n31\n00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.660\nJust as an example I'll\nshow you how to write\n\n32\n00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.730\nsome some if statements\nin future episodes.\n\n33\n00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.830\nBut let's say when I open this up,\nI really just wanna see that summary.\n\n34\n00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.430\nOr I want to send it to somebody and\nI want them just to see the summary.\n\n35\n00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.490\nI don't want them focusing\nin on the details.\n\n36\n00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.700\nWell you can hide worksheets\nwithin a workbook.\n\n37\n00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.638\nIt's actually pretty easy to do.\n\n38\n00:01:52.638 --> 00:01:56.130\nAll I'm gonna do is right click on\nthe tab down here and choose hide.\n\n39\n00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.650\nI know that was crazy complex,\nwant me to do it again?\n\n40\n00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.860\nI'm going to right click on February and\nchoose hide.\n\n41\n00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.170\nAnd notice it disappears.\n\n42\n00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.670\nI can take the rest of these sheets,\nright click hide, and\n\n43\n00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.560\nI now have just the summary.\n\n44\n00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.770\nSo when I go to send this or when\nsomebody opens this workbook up, in fact,\n\n45\n00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:20.910\nhere let's save it and close it, and\noops we'll close that one as well for now.\n\n46\n00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.439\nAnd I'm gonna open that one back up.\n\n47\n00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.170\nAnd ta da, only one tab shows.\n\n48\n00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.870\nNow, they're not gone.\n\n49\n00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:29.710\nThey're just hidden.\n\n50\n00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:30.480\nI didn't delete them.\n\n51\n00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.610\nI didn't get a warning about,\nhey, you're gonna lose your data.\n\n52\n00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.000\nIn fact, these formulas are pulling\nfrom that January worksheet.\n\n53\n00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.090\nSo that's where that information is\ncoming from, and it's still working.\n\n54\n00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.060\nSo, obviously they're still there.\n\n55\n00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.280\nThey're just not visible.\n\n56\n00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.692\nIf I wanna get them back, I'm gonna right\nclick on the one tab that's left and\n\n57\n00:02:47.692 --> 00:02:48.440\nchoose unhide.\n\n58\n00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.580\nNotice it's got those ellipsis dots.\n\n59\n00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.380\nThat means I'm expecting\na dialogue box to open up.\n\n60\n00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.500\nAnd sure enough I did, and I can\nchoose which sheet or all the sheets.\n\n61\n00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.350\nIt should let me check them all.\n\n62\n00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.070\nAre you gonna play along?\n\n63\n00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.630\nMy keyboard shortcuts\naren't quite working.\n\n64\n00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.750\nSo it looks like I have\nto do it one at a time.\n\n65\n00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.950\nNormally, you can select all of those.\n\n66\n00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.880\nIt's just not letting me select\nmore than one at a time.\n\n67\n00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.829\nSo we'll go ahead and I'll quickly go\nthrough here and unhide each one of those.\n\n68\n00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.470\n>> Mike, the ability to hide these\nworksheets is really effective,\n\n69\n00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.220\nespecially when you don't\nwant people messing around\n\n70\n00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.430\nwith the other data\nthat might be in there.\n\n71\n00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.150\nIt's all right to show them what you wanna\nshow them, but there are times when you do\n\n72\n00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.090\nhave a workbook which has\na lot of information in it and\n\n73\n00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.770\nyou are sharing it out to someone.\n\n74\n00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.990\nSomebody can accidentally\nclick on something or\n\n75\n00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.990\nchange a formula,and\nnow you're in trouble.\n\n76\n00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.740\nBy simply hiding it, we're not really\nprotecting the document in terms of\n\n77\n00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.880\nlocking it down, but we are making\nit more difficult for them to find.\n\n78\n00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.810\nAnd that way hopefully they\nwon't be too curious, and\n\n79\n00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.410\nthey won't have to\nactually figure that out.\n\n80\n00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.300\nBut I know I've seen this before too,\nMike.\n\n81\n00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.470\nWhere somebody did send me a workbook, and\n\n82\n00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.080\nthen I was like how in the world\ndid they figure that out?\n\n83\n00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.920\nAnd I knew that there was a formula\nsomewhere it was referring to,\n\n84\n00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.250\nbut I didn't see the tab\nthat it was referring to.\n\n85\n00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.280\nSo, if I didn't know how to get to it,\n\n86\n00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.860\nmore than likely I\nprobably wouldn't find it.\n\n87\n00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.350\nAnd thereby wouldn't mess with that\nformula, which is probably fairly helpful.\n\n88\n00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.450\n>> Exactly right, Ronnie.\n\n89\n00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.220\nLet's make sure we're clear on that.\n\n90\n00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.000\nIt is not a security measure.\n\n91\n00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.110\nAs you saw when I unhid those sheets,\nI didn't have to put in a password or\n\n92\n00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.050\nknow anything, know no secret combination.\n\n93\n00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.620\nI just right click on a tab and\nif unhide is grayed out,\n\n94\n00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.700\nI know there's no hidden sheets.\n\n95\n00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.850\nIf there's even one sheet hidden, that'll\nbe available and I can click on it.\n\n96\n00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.710\nSo it's not a security measure,\nnot by any means,\n\n97\n00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.440\nbut it does keep the casual mistakes\nfrom happening, as Ronnie said.\n\n98\n00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.800\nI've created several workbooks\nwhere one of the sheets was just,\n\n99\n00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.460\nwhat do I usually call them,\nit's like a workspace.\n\n100\n00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.190\nI've got where I'm creating these\nformulas that are compiling data and\n\n101\n00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.470\ngetting summaries of information.\n\n102\n00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.140\nAnd it's not in any pretty format that\nI wanna see or anything like that.\n\n103\n00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.720\nI'll have a tab for every month,\nor a tab for every sales person.\n\n104\n00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.260\nAnd I'll have one tab that I use\njust to run through some formulas.\n\n105\n00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.940\nAnd then I'll have another tab for\n\n106\n00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:16.180\nsummary, where the summary information\nis displayed in a nice pretty table.\n\n107\n00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.880\nBut the worksheet that has all the actual\ncalculations and stuff, I hide it, I don't\n\n108\n00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.980\nwant anyone accidentally changing one of\nthose formulas or something like that.\n\n109\n00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.280\nSo it's a really handy feature to\nbe able to hide those worksheets.\n\n110\n00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.170\nAnother thing you can do, and\nI'll close this workbook.\n\n111\n00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:38.175\nAnd I'm going to open up my employee's\nworksheet, or workbook real quick.\n\n112\n00:05:38.175 --> 00:05:41.940\nIs you can hide individual columns,\nor rows as well,\n\n113\n00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.150\ninstead of the entire worksheet.\n\n114\n00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.330\nThis is just an employee's\nworksheet that I've whipped up.\n\n115\n00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.150\nIt has some normal columns, first name,\n\n116\n00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.000\nlast name, address information,\ne-mail, hire date.\n\n117\n00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.100\nBut as we go out I've got a salary column.\n\n118\n00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.430\nI might have information like\nSocial Security number, dependents or\n\n119\n00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.300\nhealthcare information, and maybe I need\nsomebody to work with this spreadsheet,\n\n120\n00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.890\nbut they can't see that information,\nor I don't want them to see it easily.\n\n121\n00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.470\nBecause if I have this spreadsheet open,\nlet's say, and again,\n\n122\n00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.670\nit's not really a security thing.\n\n123\n00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.630\nSo I don't want you to think\nIf I give it to somebody,\n\n124\n00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.410\nthey won't be able to unhide them.\n\n125\n00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.420\nBut if I'm working at this and I've got,\nlike David in our chatroom was talking\n\n126\n00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.220\nearlier, I've got three monitors\nthe size of 40 inch TVs.\n\n127\n00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:28.250\nIf I've got this sheet open and somebody\nwalks by, can't they see that information?\n\n128\n00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.890\nAnd I could get in trouble if HIPAA\nrequirements or some other industry or\n\n129\n00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:35.300\ngovernmental regulation is in place,\nI could get in trouble for\n\n130\n00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.890\nexposing that information.\n\n131\n00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.320\nIt's personally identifiable.\n\n132\n00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.210\nIt's private information.\n\n133\n00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.190\nSo, even if it's me working with it,\nI might choose to hide that.\n\n134\n00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:45.488\nAnd it's the exact same way.\n\n135\n00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:50.230\nI can right-click on that column and\nI can choose hide and the column's gone.\n\n136\n00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.720\nNow with this, unlike the sheets, you can\ndefinitely tell a column has been hidden,\n\n137\n00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.960\nbecause I go from column K to column M.\n\n138\n00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:04.020\nIf we know our alphabet, we know there's\nsomething missing there, J-K-L-M.\n\n139\n00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.230\nSo if I want to unhide it,\n\n140\n00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:09.040\nthis is where it's a little bit\ntrickier than the worksheets.\n\n141\n00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:14.900\nI can't just right-click and\nchoose unhide.\n\n142\n00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.330\nActually, I shouldn't say I can't.\n\n143\n00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.070\nYou see, I can.\n\n144\n00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.580\nI can right click unhide,\nbut nothing happened.\n\n145\n00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.270\nMy column didn't come back.\n\n146\n00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:24.740\nTo unhide a column,\n\n147\n00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.790\nyou have to select the columns on\neither side of the hidden column.\n\n148\n00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:33.230\nSo, basically, now, that hidden column\nis selected, cuz I had to click and\n\n149\n00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:37.200\ndrag from column K to column M.\n\n150\n00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.480\nWhich includes L,\neven though it's not visible.\n\n151\n00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.470\nNow when I right-click and\nunhide, it comes right back.\n\n152\n00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:45.870\nAnd you can hide multiple columns.\n\n153\n00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:48.939\nWhat if I want to make a phone list?\n\n154\n00:07:48.939 --> 00:07:52.273\nAnd for my phone list, I don't want\nto retype all this information,\n\n155\n00:07:52.273 --> 00:07:54.700\nbut I don't want the address\ninformation there.\n\n156\n00:07:54.700 --> 00:08:00.131\nSo I might grab these three columns and\nhide them.\n\n157\n00:08:00.131 --> 00:08:00.677\nAll right.\n\n158\n00:08:00.677 --> 00:08:04.080\nAnd then I might grab\nthese columns over here.\n\n159\n00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.312\nWell maybe this one, then hide it.\n\n160\n00:08:06.312 --> 00:08:08.471\nWhoops.\n\n161\n00:08:08.471 --> 00:08:12.610\nAnd this one, and hide it, all right.\n\n162\n00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:15.950\nSo now I've just got name,\nphone number, email and department.\n\n163\n00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:17.700\nSomething I could print up,\nor something like that.\n\n164\n00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.590\nAnd let's see what happens\nwhen we go to print.\n\n165\n00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:20.090\nFile.\n\n166\n00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:22.160\nPrint.\n\n167\n00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.700\nAnd notice that my print preview.\n\n168\n00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.130\nOops.\n\n169\n00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:27.570\nLet's not do that.\n\n170\n00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:28.770\nLet's zoom in there.\n\n171\n00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:32.660\nAll I'm seeing is first name,\nlast name, phone, email and department.\n\n172\n00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:35.820\nSo when you go to print it doesn't\nprint anything that's hidden.\n\n173\n00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.090\nThose columns that I hid won't\nshow up in my print job.\n\n174\n00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:41.940\nSo now I've got a quick easy\nway to whip out a phone list.\n\n175\n00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:44.450\nWithout having to create\na separate spreadsheet,\n\n176\n00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.880\nwithout all that other information, right.\n\n177\n00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.570\nHandy dandy little trick to be\nable to hide those columns.\n\n178\n00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.760\nAnd then I can simply,\nsince I hid columns all over the place and\n\n179\n00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.910\nI want to get them all back,\nI'll just select the entire worksheet.\n\n180\n00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:00.330\nThere's a little special\ntriangle between A and\n\n181\n00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.480\n1 here, if you click on that it\nselects the entire worksheet.\n\n182\n00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.010\nRight click,\nhang on let me zoom back out here,\n\n183\n00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:11.370\nunhide, then I should get all of\nthose columns back, all right.\n\n184\n00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:15.430\nSo hiding worksheets within a workbook,\nhiding columns and\n\n185\n00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:18.920\nrows would work the exact\nsame way as columns.\n\n186\n00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:23.090\nSo if I had a row that had some summary\ninformation that I didn't want to see or\n\n187\n00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:27.210\nI wanted to hide all the detail rows,\nI could hide the rows just as well.\n\n188\n00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:30.150\n>> Yeah, Mike, I see this most often,\na lot of times,\n\n189\n00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:34.180\nin presentations like on PowerPoints\nwhere they really just need to show that\n\n190\n00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:37.560\nparticular Excel spreadsheet but they\ndon't need to show all the data in it.\n\n191\n00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:42.010\nIt allows them to be able to print or\ndo what they want to and export that and\n\n192\n00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:44.820\nmake it look exactly look like that\nwithout having to actually recreate\n\n193\n00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:48.820\na whole new spreadsheet to just\npresent the data that they need.\n\n194\n00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.310\nAnd the other one is when you're\nactually sharing that data,\n\n195\n00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:54.000\nlike what Mike was saying,\nwith somebody right there on your screen.\n\n196\n00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.230\nYou need them to take a look at it and\nmaybe do some analysis but there is some\n\n197\n00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:01.690\npersonalized data on there you don't want\nthem actually to be able to look at.\n\n198\n00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:04.810\nInstead of you having to go like,\nlet me just copy this over here,\n\n199\n00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:06.270\ncopy this column over here.\n\n200\n00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:08.720\nAnd this is what I really want\nyou to focus in on Ronnie.\n\n201\n00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.480\nYou just simply hide those columns and\nthen you actually leave them,\n\n202\n00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.690\nfocus what they need.\n\n203\n00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:16.890\nAfter that little mini consultation's\nover, you can unhide it, and\n\n204\n00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:20.490\nthen you have all of your data\navailable and ready for you to go.\n\n205\n00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:23.710\nIt is a very effective way\nthat you can customize for\n\n206\n00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:27.400\nwhat you need right at that moment,\nand then of course, change it back,\n\n207\n00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.890\nwhen you know everything is actually\nthe way that you need it to be.\n\n208\n00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:30.700\n>> Absolutely.\n\n209\n00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:34.310\nI've worked with spreadsheets that have\nhad a couple dozen columns in there.\n\n210\n00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.830\nAnd the work I needed to do only\ninvolved a few of those columns.\n\n211\n00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:41.620\nAnd scrolling up and down, I'm on\na touchpad here, and I can scroll up and\n\n212\n00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:42.640\ndown very easy.\n\n213\n00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.910\nScrolling side to side on\nthis touchpad is not so easy.\n\n214\n00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:49.190\nI gotta go down here and\ngrab this thing and drag it over.\n\n215\n00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:50.640\nI didn't want to have to do that.\n\n216\n00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.320\nI was spending hours working\non these complex formulas,\n\n217\n00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.720\ndealing with these columns.\n\n218\n00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.400\nAnd the columns were like column B,\nas well as column N,\n\n219\n00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.070\nas well column P, as well as column AC.\n\n220\n00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:02.960\nThey're all spread out.\n\n221\n00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.480\nI just hid all the rest of the columns.\n\n222\n00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.610\nThe only thing I've got left\nare the ones that I need to work with.\n\n223\n00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:08.780\nI don't need to scroll\nhorizontally anymore.\n\n224\n00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:09.730\nSo it's, as Ronnie says,\n\n225\n00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:13.900\nthere are several different things you\ncan really use that hiding columns for.\n\n226\n00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:15.100\nAll right, other things we can do.\n\n227\n00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.150\nWe can change our views.\n\n228\n00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:20.410\nWe've really, we've seen this in\na couple of the other episodes.\n\n229\n00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:24.810\nDown here in the bottom in my status bar,\nI've got that normal view,\n\n230\n00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:27.890\nwhich is what we currently have,\nor what we usually work with.\n\n231\n00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:30.150\nI've also got that page layout view,\n\n232\n00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:33.070\nwhich we saw when we were\ndoing headers and footers.\n\n233\n00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:35.540\nBut you can also use this when\nyou're working with your margins,\n\n234\n00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.740\ntrying to figure out how much space.\n\n235\n00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:43.020\nIf you want to go with those narrow\nmargins, or with those Wide margins.\n\n236\n00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.710\nI can see now what that's doing there.\n\n237\n00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:48.170\nI can even adjust the margins.\n\n238\n00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:51.450\nOther than those default margins,\nI can now move this around.\n\n239\n00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:54.120\nSee I'm dragging that over a little bit?\n\n240\n00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.650\nSo I can work with those margins\nthrough that page layout view.\n\n241\n00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:00.320\nAnd then I've got the page break preview\n\n242\n00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:04.090\nwhich shows me how it's gonna\nbreak that when I got to print it.\n\n243\n00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:06.460\nAnd a lot of this,\nlike where Ronnie said I think earlier.\n\n244\n00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:09.490\nSometimes you get surprised,\nyou're like that's not gonna work at all.\n\n245\n00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:13.539\nThis gives you a chance to see what it's\ngonna look like before you go and print it\n\n246\n00:12:13.539 --> 00:12:18.090\nand waste half a tree going that's not\nwhat I need, I need to go print it again.\n\n247\n00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:21.270\nSo it gives you a chance to look at\nthat document in these different views.\n\n248\n00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:25.660\nYou also have your View ribbon where I\ncan change between that normal page break\n\n249\n00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.810\npage layout, and\nthen there's a custom view.\n\n250\n00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:32.050\nYou might wanna tweak it to\nwhere it works for you, and\n\n251\n00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:35.840\nthen save that as a custom\nview you can do that as well.\n\n252\n00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.890\nOther things that I can do on my View,\n\n253\n00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:40.980\nif I don't wanna see my grid\nlines I can turn those off.\n\n254\n00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.270\nHave you ever seen a spreadsheet\nthat doesn't have grid lines on it?\n\n255\n00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:44.490\nYou're like, how do they do that?\n\n256\n00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:46.920\nWell there you go,\nyou can turn off those grid lines.\n\n257\n00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.890\nYou can turn off the headings if you're\nnot worried about the column and\n\n258\n00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:50.940\nrow headers.\n\n259\n00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:54.140\nYou can also turn off the formula bar,\nall right?\n\n260\n00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.910\nHide that as well.\n\n261\n00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:58.480\nAnd then we've got our ability to zoom.\n\n262\n00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.450\nAnd then zooming,\npretty straight forward, right?\n\n263\n00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:04.610\nNow I've been zooming outside of Excel.\n\n264\n00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:09.410\nI've been using something on my PC that\nI can use to zoom in to give you guys\n\n265\n00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:13.630\na better look at what's going on here so\nI can get the menus and things like that,\n\n266\n00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:17.280\nbut a lot of times, in Excel, Ronnie\nalways gives me a little bit of grief,\n\n267\n00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.955\nbecause I do tend to use\na very high resolution.\n\n268\n00:13:19.955 --> 00:13:23.040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And he's chuckling over here.\n\n269\n00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.240\nAnd sometimes,\nthe font can get a little bit small, and\n\n270\n00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.210\nit can be difficult to read.\n\n271\n00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:32.730\nWell, when Ronnie comes by, I can change\nthat very easily in a few different ways.\n\n272\n00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:36.650\nIf I need Ronnie to help me I go\ndown to the bottom of my status bar\n\n273\n00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:40.700\nwhere it says 100%, and\n[LAUGH] at least 200 for Ron.\n\n274\n00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:41.220\nYeah, right.\n\n275\n00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:44.020\nAnd you could see it jumps it up there and\n\n276\n00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:47.060\nmakes it a little bit\neasier to see that data.\n\n277\n00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.750\nI can go back there and\nreset that back to 100.\n\n278\n00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:52.770\nI can also choose one\nof these other presets,\n\n279\n00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:54.600\nfit selection is an interesting one.\n\n280\n00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.350\nLet me set it back to 100.\n\n281\n00:13:56.350 --> 00:14:03.450\nAnd I'm gonna select the first,\njust this little group of cells here.\n\n282\n00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:06.700\nAnd then I'm gonna say, Fit Selection.\n\n283\n00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:13.000\nAnd notice it jumps until that\nselection takes up my entire screen.\n\n284\n00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.930\nEither horizontally or vertically\ndepending how far it can squeeze it.\n\n285\n00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:18.190\nOr stretch it out there.\n\n286\n00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:22.470\nSo you can zoom in to a particular\narea on the spreadsheet,\n\n287\n00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:25.840\neven if you don't know exactly\nwhat size you want to use.\n\n288\n00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.930\nYou can type in a custom number.\n\n289\n00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:31.605\nYou've got the the zoom\noption up here on your ribbon\n\n290\n00:14:31.605 --> 00:14:34.145\nwhich brings up that same dialog box.\n\n291\n00:14:34.145 --> 00:14:38.355\nYou got the reset to 100,\nzoom to selection there as well.\n\n292\n00:14:38.355 --> 00:14:40.005\nOne that I don't show or\n\n293\n00:14:40.005 --> 00:14:43.465\nis not showing right now that I want\nto show you is our zoom slider.\n\n294\n00:14:43.465 --> 00:14:45.295\nI find that one really handy.\n\n295\n00:14:45.295 --> 00:14:47.530\nIt doesn't show up by default down here.\n\n296\n00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:49.240\nBut if I right click on my status bar,\n\n297\n00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.920\nremember this is where I changed the\nsummary and the counts what we're showing\n\n298\n00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:58.000\non the status bar in that first episode,\ndown here I can choose zoom slider.\n\n299\n00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.350\nAll right?\n\n300\n00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:04.230\nAnd now on my status bar I've got\na slider and I can grab that and\n\n301\n00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:05.639\ndrag that back and forth.\n\n302\n00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.010\nAll right?\n\n303\n00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:11.390\nSo I can, instead of saying I wanna\ngo to 125 or I wanna go to 150,\n\n304\n00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:16.080\nI can just drag it until it gets big\nenough for me to see and let go, right?\n\n305\n00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.140\nNow I'm at 166.\n\n306\n00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:18.990\nWho woulda thought to type in 166, right?\n\n307\n00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:23.000\nSo it gives you the ability to\njust say hey, I'm gonna zoom in.\n\n308\n00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.500\nI'll tell you when to stop instead\nof picking a preset number there.\n\n309\n00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:30.730\nSo a few different ways I can zoom\ninto there to change my view.\n\n310\n00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:35.400\nOther things we can do with our view,\nwe've got the window ribbon group.\n\n311\n00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.710\nAnd on here I've got things\nlike new window, arrange all,\n\n312\n00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:41.360\nfreeze panes, split and hide.\n\n313\n00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:45.180\nThey really don't call out most of these\non this particular set of objectives.\n\n314\n00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:52.370\nThe ones I want to work with are freeze\npanes, split, hide does just that.\n\n315\n00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:57.945\nI'm not exactly sure where\nthat option helps me.\n\n316\n00:15:57.945 --> 00:16:02.684\nIt used to be in versions of Excel,\nwhen you open up more than one workbook,\n\n317\n00:16:02.684 --> 00:16:04.352\nYou had one Excel window.\n\n318\n00:16:04.352 --> 00:16:07.930\nAnd then within that Excel window you\ncould have several workbooks open and\n\n319\n00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:10.370\nthen each workbook contained worksheets.\n\n320\n00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:13.410\nAnd so sometimes it was easy if\nyou wanted to hide one workbook,\n\n321\n00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:16.740\nit would minimize that workbook\nwithin the Excel window.\n\n322\n00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:18.970\nYou'd see it down at the bottom down here.\n\n323\n00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:23.320\nThat's the only reason I can\nthink to use that, cuz now\n\n324\n00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:28.960\nwhen you open up a second workbook,\nit's not in the same window, right?\n\n325\n00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:33.080\nSo now I have two separate Excel windows,\none with each workbook.\n\n326\n00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:38.660\nSo when I go over here and\nI choose View > Hide, there we go.\n\n327\n00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:40.563\nIt does hide the entire workbook for you.\n\n328\n00:16:40.563 --> 00:16:44.620\nSo maybe that's something\nyou might find useful.\n\n329\n00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.060\nIf you're working with four or\nfive different workbooks at a time,\n\n330\n00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:50.610\nand you wanna hide one of those,\nyou can simply hide it there.\n\n331\n00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:53.520\nLet me get back over\nto my other worksheet.\n\n332\n00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.760\nBut the ones I really want to focus\nthat they're gonna call out on the exam,\n\n333\n00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.820\nif you're studying for that,\nand that I find useful\n\n334\n00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:04.110\nwhen I'm working with Excel every day,\nare these freeze and split options.\n\n335\n00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:07.980\nAll right, the split option's\ninteresting if you select it.\n\n336\n00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:11.520\nI'm gonna just select a cell out here,\nand then choose Split.\n\n337\n00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.430\nAnd, what it does is it\nputs a set of crosshairs or\n\n338\n00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:19.900\nthese dividers right to the top and\nleft of the cell I had selected.\n\n339\n00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.310\nRemember everything moves down and right.\n\n340\n00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:26.260\nOkay, but, what it did for\nme, what do those bars mean?\n\n341\n00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.280\nWell now if I'm in the bottom half and\n\n342\n00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:33.040\nI scroll up, notice it scrolls\nup at that divider, right?\n\n343\n00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.490\nNow if I go up to the top half and\nscroll, right,\n\n344\n00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:38.920\nI'm scrolling up in that top half only.\n\n345\n00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:43.268\nAnd the data is the same,\nit's just a mirror of, if I change,\n\n346\n00:17:43.268 --> 00:17:47.850\nlet's see, so this is row 4,\nthis is also row 4 down here.\n\n347\n00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:53.160\nIf I change this to FL, all right,\nnoticed it changed it down here as well.\n\n348\n00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.220\nSo it's not duplicating the data.\n\n349\n00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:58.690\nIt can get a little twisty if you're not\ncareful, cuz you're seeing the row twice,\n\n350\n00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:00.170\nonce at the top, once at the bottom.\n\n351\n00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:03.290\nThis'd be really handy if\nI had a set of headers.\n\n352\n00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:05.780\nIn fact,\nlet's move that up a little bit, right?\n\n353\n00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.110\nSon now I can see that header row.\n\n354\n00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:13.430\nAnd as I scroll through here,\nnotice that header row stays, right?\n\n355\n00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:15.650\nAnd there are other ways to do that.\n\n356\n00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:20.120\nBut this is nice because I can\nadjust how many rows don't scroll\n\n357\n00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:23.930\nwhen I scroll the bottom half, all right?\n\n358\n00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:25.750\nSo maybe my header row contains two or\n\n359\n00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:30.000\nthree rows of information that I want to\nstay there, so I can scroll that way.\n\n360\n00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.050\nYou can also scroll left or\n\n361\n00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:36.260\nright, it does the same thing,\nit's gonna scroll at that bar.\n\n362\n00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.910\nIf I go over to this side\nit's gonna scroll just,\n\n363\n00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:41.530\nit's not gonna let me\nscroll that side is it?\n\n364\n00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.170\nSorry, I'm using the wrong scrollbar.\n\n365\n00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:48.120\nI've got my other horizontal scrollbar for\nthat one.\n\n366\n00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:52.800\nSo the split, I think it's one of those\nthings that you might find very useful.\n\n367\n00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:53.890\nPlay around with it a little bit.\n\n368\n00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:56.500\nYou can see me,\neven though I've used this many times,\n\n369\n00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.720\nI still get a little bit, okay,\nwait, what scrollbar was I using?\n\n370\n00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:03.380\nSo if you don't play with this one,\nit's a little bit confusing.\n\n371\n00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:07.950\nAnd the fact that you can drag these\nguys around is kinda cool as well.\n\n372\n00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:10.220\nBecause I can adjust how many rows\n\n373\n00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:15.590\nI am preventing from scrolling or\nmaintaining in that one section.\n\n374\n00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:19.390\n>> Now Mike, I know that I've used this\nfeature a lot and it's usually for\n\n375\n00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:20.880\ntwo reasons, right?\n\n376\n00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.990\nOne is that there's a lot of\nactual rows that we have.\n\n377\n00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:28.120\nSo like the worksheet that we had dealt\nwith in an earlier episode where there\n\n378\n00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.370\nwere 3,000 rows.\n\n379\n00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:32.465\nI know that I've taken a regular\nworksheet of just 500 rows,\n\n380\n00:19:32.465 --> 00:19:35.389\nstarted to scroll down and\nactually looked at the columns and\n\n381\n00:19:35.389 --> 00:19:38.108\ndidn't realize what the actual\ncolumns were anymore.\n\n382\n00:19:38.108 --> 00:19:40.606\nThen I'm like, what's that data for?\n\n383\n00:19:40.606 --> 00:19:41.989\nAnd I had to scroll all\nthe way up to the top.\n\n384\n00:19:41.989 --> 00:19:43.085\nAnd then, that's right.\n\n385\n00:19:43.085 --> 00:19:46.770\nAnd then I scrolled down to like\nrow 600 and then forgot again.\n\n386\n00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:50.950\nBy being able to split that the way\nthat Mike just showed us, right,\n\n387\n00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:55.150\nwe can leave that top column there,\nthe header columns there.\n\n388\n00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:58.080\nAnd now we can take that second\nwindow at the bottom there, and\n\n389\n00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:02.515\nscroll down to row number 600, and\nRonnie Wong would not get confused.\n\n390\n00:20:02.515 --> 00:20:03.920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And realize, yeah,\n\n391\n00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.450\nthat's what that data's for.\n\n392\n00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:09.920\nWell, you can imagine the same then,\nwith very wide spreadsheets too.\n\n393\n00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.730\nThat, if there were columns\nthat you wanted to compare, and\n\n394\n00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:20.010\nyou might have a comparison, let's say,\nof your company's entire sales history.\n\n395\n00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:23.570\nLet's say now it's kept in an old\nledger book forever and ever and\n\n396\n00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:26.630\nsomebody started putting it in here,\nand now you have every year.\n\n397\n00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:32.500\nYou wanted to compare,\nlet's say, 1968 with 2015.\n\n398\n00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:37.051\nWell, you know that that would not\nactually fit onto the width of a standard\n\n399\n00:20:37.051 --> 00:20:39.083\nExcel spreadsheet very easily.\n\n400\n00:20:39.083 --> 00:20:42.286\nAnd so what you can do is set that\ncolumn over there on the left and\n\n401\n00:20:42.286 --> 00:20:44.410\nthen scroll all the way over to 2015.\n\n402\n00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:47.540\nAnd have a direct comparison of those two.\n\n403\n00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:51.925\nSo when you have very wide workbooks or\nwhen you have very long workbooks,\n\n404\n00:20:51.925 --> 00:20:55.753\nusing something like the split column,\nor not a split columns.\n\n405\n00:20:55.753 --> 00:20:56.281\n>> Split view.\n\n406\n00:20:56.281 --> 00:21:00.280\n>> Split view works very well,\nbecause it does.\n\n407\n00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:04.080\nIt allows you to do that line by\nline comparison if you need to, and\n\n408\n00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.100\neven helps you to keep track of things.\n\n409\n00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:10.270\nIt is by far one of the most useful\ntools when you do have those gigantic,\n\n410\n00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.210\ngigantic, gigantic\nspreadsheets that's out there.\n\n411\n00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:16.770\nAnd a lot of times it's not because\nyou chose to make it that way, right?\n\n412\n00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:20.430\nSometimes it's a spreadsheet you\ninherited, and you just don't have time to\n\n413\n00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:23.400\ngo back through and go,\nI wanna divide all this up here.\n\n414\n00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.064\nYou just have to work with it as is.\n\n415\n00:21:25.064 --> 00:21:25.967\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So you just do it.\n\n416\n00:21:25.967 --> 00:21:28.690\n>> Absolutely, I can show you exactly\nwhat Ronnie's talking about here.\n\n417\n00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:30.460\nIf we go back to my screen.\n\n418\n00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:33.260\nLet me just make up a new column,\nwe'll call it Total.\n\n419\n00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:36.100\nOops, if I could spell.\n\n420\n00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:39.574\nAnd real quick,\nI'm just gonna write a simple formula.\n\n421\n00:21:39.574 --> 00:21:44.542\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That equals and\n\n422\n00:21:44.542 --> 00:21:47.795\nthen we'll just fill\nthat all the way down.\n\n423\n00:21:47.795 --> 00:21:50.744\nAnd I'll show you these techniques here\nas we get through and we get to formulas.\n\n424\n00:21:50.744 --> 00:21:53.342\nBut to show you what he was talking about,\n\n425\n00:21:53.342 --> 00:21:57.215\nas I scroll down here through\nthis list of orders, all right?\n\n426\n00:21:57.215 --> 00:21:59.295\nWell what is this column number for?\n\n427\n00:21:59.295 --> 00:22:01.025\nWhat is this, it looks like money?\n\n428\n00:22:01.025 --> 00:22:02.715\nWhat is this, it looks like money?\n\n429\n00:22:02.715 --> 00:22:03.785\nWhat's what right?\n\n430\n00:22:03.785 --> 00:22:07.560\nHave to go back up here and go,\nyeah, the last column was the total.\n\n431\n00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.250\nWell if we do out split, right?\n\n432\n00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:14.540\nAnd we drag this up to here,\n\n433\n00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:17.960\nnow as we scroll, oops,\nmake sure you have the right one selected.\n\n434\n00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.923\nAs I scroll down,\nthere's no more confusion.\n\n435\n00:22:20.923 --> 00:22:22.873\nI'm down here on these rows way down here.\n\n436\n00:22:22.873 --> 00:22:26.286\nI still know this is quantity,\nunit, price and total.\n\n437\n00:22:26.286 --> 00:22:28.399\nAnd the same thing as it works for\nthe columns.\n\n438\n00:22:28.399 --> 00:22:32.036\nI got the names over here, but\nI've got information way over here.\n\n439\n00:22:32.036 --> 00:22:36.608\nAnd if this was not split,\nas I scroll over.\n\n440\n00:22:36.608 --> 00:22:39.228\n>> You lose the names.\n>> I lose those names over there and\n\n441\n00:22:39.228 --> 00:22:41.960\nI don't know whose salary this is.\n\n442\n00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.700\nBut if I do my split, and\n\n443\n00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:49.270\nI split it right there,\nnow as I scroll over, those names stay.\n\n444\n00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:52.760\nIn fact, I can all the way,\nforce it to go even further.\n\n445\n00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.880\nAnd I can get that salary right\nnext to their name, right?\n\n446\n00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.670\nSo it really is a handy feature.\n\n447\n00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:02.220\nAnd to turn it off, you just unselect\nSplit up there, it goes away.\n\n448\n00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:07.220\nAnother option is Freeze Panes, Freeze\nPanes pretty much does the same thing.\n\n449\n00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:09.620\nBut you have a couple\nof pre-built options.\n\n450\n00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:13.490\nKeep rows and columns visible while\nthe rest of the worksheet scrolls,\n\n451\n00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:15.510\nbased on current selection.\n\n452\n00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:18.650\nSo let's select, so I'll just put\nmy cursor right up here on C4.\n\n453\n00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:22.012\nAnd I'll choose that first option,\nFreeze Pane.\n\n454\n00:23:22.012 --> 00:23:26.797\nAnd now I can see that as I scroll,\nsame thing as the split, right, but\n\n455\n00:23:26.797 --> 00:23:29.240\nnotice I can't change it.\n\n456\n00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:32.310\nThat's the difference here,\nI can't drag that line.\n\n457\n00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:35.810\nSame thing when I scroll horizontally,\nall right?\n\n458\n00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:39.890\nThose first two columns stay, but\nI can't scroll the other sections.\n\n459\n00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:46.992\nOnce I select over here, you see\nI've only got one horizontal slider.\n\n460\n00:23:46.992 --> 00:23:48.398\nWhereas in the split,\n\n461\n00:23:48.398 --> 00:23:52.625\nI could scroll each side of that\nhorizontal slider independently.\n\n462\n00:23:52.625 --> 00:23:56.248\nWith the freeze panes,\nyou're only scrolling the right or\n\n463\n00:23:56.248 --> 00:23:58.866\nthe bottom of wherever that cross occurs.\n\n464\n00:23:58.866 --> 00:24:02.345\nAnd again,\nthat one's based on your selection, and\n\n465\n00:24:02.345 --> 00:24:06.535\nI just chose unfroze Once you\nfreeze them you can unfreeze them.\n\n466\n00:24:06.535 --> 00:24:08.590\nThe other options here, freeze top row.\n\n467\n00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:12.330\nThat's really handy because\n\n468\n00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:15.240\nnine times out of ten it is\nthe top row that you wanna freeze.\n\n469\n00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:18.220\nAnd I don't even have to click on\nanything or select any cell first.\n\n470\n00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:20.540\nI can just go freeze top row.\n\n471\n00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:21.940\nOr freeze first column.\n\n472\n00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:23.842\nBecause that's typically,\nagain what we're trying to do.\n\n473\n00:24:23.842 --> 00:24:27.413\nA lot of times, that first column,\nthat has the pertinent information,\n\n474\n00:24:27.413 --> 00:24:30.180\nthe identifier for the data for\nthe rest of the row.\n\n475\n00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:33.260\nAnd I need that to stay\nas I scroll horizontally.\n\n476\n00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:38.220\nSo those are just quick pre built\nsplits is basically what they are and\n\n477\n00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:41.760\nyou can unfreeze them anytime you want.\n\n478\n00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:45.150\n>> Now Mike there's a few other things\nthat we also wanted to show them too and\n\n479\n00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:50.340\none of them is that formula that you\njust created there for that total.\n\n480\n00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:55.050\nWell, I saw the result of it, but is there\na way to display the formula itself?\n\n481\n00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:57.790\n>> There is absolutely a way to do that.\n\n482\n00:24:57.790 --> 00:24:58.846\nI've just got to remember how.\n\n483\n00:24:58.846 --> 00:25:01.173\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n484\n00:25:01.173 --> 00:25:03.565\n>> It's a great question because normally,\n\n485\n00:25:03.565 --> 00:25:05.100\nwe don't see the formula.\n\n486\n00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:08.700\nNow if I select over here and\nthis is just a different sheet but,\n\n487\n00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:11.140\nwell let me find one that\nactually has some formulas.\n\n488\n00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:13.010\nOr I could go back to that\none we just did, right?\n\n489\n00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:16.470\nI forgot, we did add a column to that.\n\n490\n00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:18.980\nWhere did we do that at?\n\n491\n00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:20.887\n>> I think it was\n>> It was actually on orders wasn't it?\n\n492\n00:25:20.887 --> 00:25:22.330\n>> Yes, I think it was on orders.\n\n493\n00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:24.110\n>> All right, we'll go over here.\n\n494\n00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:25.580\nAnd there's the column I added.\n\n495\n00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:29.150\nAnd I can see that formula there,\nas well as on this summary.\n\n496\n00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:30.290\nI've got these numbers, but\n\n497\n00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:33.650\nif I look, those numbers\nare actually formulas, right.\n\n498\n00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:34.690\nThe contents of the cell.\n\n499\n00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:37.282\nAnd that's something we probably should\nhave explained earlier with Excel.\n\n500\n00:25:37.282 --> 00:25:44.492\nYou've gotta remember that the content of\nthe cell and the display can be different.\n\n501\n00:25:44.492 --> 00:25:47.637\nThis cell does not\ncontain the number 2941.\n\n502\n00:25:47.637 --> 00:25:49.577\nEven though it looks like it does, right?\n\n503\n00:25:49.577 --> 00:25:54.987\nThis cell contains a formula, the result\nof that formula is the number 2941 and\n\n504\n00:25:54.987 --> 00:25:57.710\nthat's what it's displaying.\n\n505\n00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:00.733\nBut the actual content is\nthis formula here, all right?\n\n506\n00:26:00.733 --> 00:26:04.415\nIf that January spreadsheet went away,\nthis would show an error,\n\n507\n00:26:04.415 --> 00:26:09.230\nbecause it's not the actual number,\nit's a formula that's in that cell.\n\n508\n00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:13.390\nNow if we want to see those formulas,\nwe're going to go over to our formulas\n\n509\n00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:18.270\nribbon, all right, and\nthen there's a button for Show Formulas.\n\n510\n00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:21.063\nClick that, and now instead of the data.\n\n511\n00:26:21.063 --> 00:26:21.701\n>> Nice.\n\n512\n00:26:21.701 --> 00:26:26.046\n>> I see the formulas, so it gives me\nthe ability to go in there and see one,\n\n513\n00:26:26.046 --> 00:26:28.580\nwhat cells contain formulas.\n\n514\n00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:31.410\nOver here, are those formulas or not?\n\n515\n00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:32.100\nWe don't know.\n\n516\n00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:37.180\nIf we do Show Formulas now I know that\nthose first two columns are numbers\n\n517\n00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:41.010\nare not formulas if I can get my\nscroller to play along with me here.\n\n518\n00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:43.680\nWow, it really wants to jump around.\n\n519\n00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:46.090\nI could see that the first two\ncolumns are not formulas, but\n\n520\n00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:48.340\nthis one actually is a formula.\n\n521\n00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:51.240\nNotice it also shows me\nthe dependence of those formulas.\n\n522\n00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.443\nWhat cells it's basing\nthat information on.\n\n523\n00:26:53.443 --> 00:26:57.000\nLet's see if we can go back over and\nwe go back over here.\n\n524\n00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.640\nI can choose one of these.\n\n525\n00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:02.180\nI can see it's looking at,\nwe'll make that a little wider, all right.\n\n526\n00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:08.780\nThe summary, the name there, it's also\npulling information from over here, right.\n\n527\n00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:11.990\nIt's doing a summary of\nthat column D there.\n\n528\n00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:15.260\nSo the Show Formulas is really\nhandy if you're just trying to see,\n\n529\n00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:17.270\nare there any formulas in here?\n\n530\n00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:19.590\nYou might be giving that\nspreadsheet to somebody,\n\n531\n00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:21.670\nand you don't want them\nto have those formulas.\n\n532\n00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:24.440\nThose formulas can sometimes\nbe very complex to write.\n\n533\n00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.700\nI've written formulas where\nI've had to take this and\n\n534\n00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:30.760\ndrag it down to about there\nto fit my formula in there.\n\n535\n00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:35.320\nNest upon nest upon nests of if\nstatements and count ifs and\n\n536\n00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.820\nsum ifs and things like that.\n\n537\n00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:38.410\nMaybe you wanna see that information.\n\n538\n00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:41.890\nThat's what I get paid to do,\nI don't want you to see that formula.\n\n539\n00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:45.520\nI need to see if there's any formulas in\nhere before I give that sheet to somebody,\n\n540\n00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:50.040\nand if there are, maybe I wanna copy\nthat data off to another sheet and\n\n541\n00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:53.780\njust do this Paste Special and\nPaste Values.\n\n542\n00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:56.460\nThat way the formulas aren't there,\nit's the actual numbers and\n\n543\n00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:57.830\nthat's all they get.\n\n544\n00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:59.890\nSo, being able to hide those\nformulas can be helpful for\n\n545\n00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:04.110\nyou so that you can figure out where\nthe formulas are in your worksheet.\n\n546\n00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:06.710\nI can also use them when I need\nto get rid off the formulas\n\n547\n00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:09.020\nbefore I give that\nworksheet to somebody else.\n\n548\n00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:10.250\n>> Excellent, now Mike,\n\n549\n00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:14.240\nthere's one other thing which is really\ndealing more with the workbook itself.\n\n550\n00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:18.270\nAnd we talk about adding in what we\ncall workbook properties, right?\n\n551\n00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:21.790\nAnd so, Mike, let's go ahead, and\nI'm gonna ask you this question.\n\n552\n00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:24.850\nOne, why would I ever do it, okay?\n\n553\n00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:27.730\nAnd then two, what do we actually\nneed to do to accomplish it?\n\n554\n00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:30.020\n>> Very good questions, and\nI don't know the answer to either.\n\n555\n00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:33.230\nNo, [LAUGH] let's talk about that.\n\n556\n00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:36.925\nWe know that files have properties right,\nall in Windows or\n\n557\n00:28:36.925 --> 00:28:42.140\nany operating system a file has properties\nlike name and size and [COUGH] excuse me.\n\n558\n00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:45.030\nCreated by and last modified,\nthings like that.\n\n559\n00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:48.770\nAnd those can be very useful to us\ndepending on what we're trying to do.\n\n560\n00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:52.310\nWe can add some additional properties and\nreally what I'm thinking about here\n\n561\n00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:56.110\nare things like tags,\nwhere we can add tags to our worksheets.\n\n562\n00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:58.320\nAnd why would I want to?\n\n563\n00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.610\nBecause it can help me find them.\n\n564\n00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:01.100\nIt can help other people find them.\n\n565\n00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:04.520\nIt's pretty neat,\nlet me show you what I mean.\n\n566\n00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:08.850\nThis spreadsheet, I'm gonna go to\nthe backstage area, so I'm gonna go File.\n\n567\n00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:15.395\nAnd on the Info tab of this backstage area\nI can see properties for my documents.\n\n568\n00:29:15.395 --> 00:29:20.226\nAnd you'll notice there's couple here,\nwe're gonna cancel out of that for\n\n569\n00:29:20.226 --> 00:29:23.670\nright now, I've got Add tag and\nAdd category.\n\n570\n00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:25.750\nSo, you can see they're\nkinda hover over them and\n\n571\n00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:30.010\nthey look like where I can fill\nsomething in and I actually can.\n\n572\n00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:33.881\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna add\na tag, I'm gonna call this one sal,\n\n573\n00:29:33.881 --> 00:29:35.140\nI'm gonna add salary.\n\n574\n00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:39.261\nAll right, I'm gonna go ahead and\ntab out of that, and\n\n575\n00:29:39.261 --> 00:29:42.048\nthen I'm gonna save that document.\n\n576\n00:29:42.048 --> 00:29:45.618\nAnd you might think well great\nMike now it has a tag of salary,\n\n577\n00:29:45.618 --> 00:29:47.890\nwhat good does that do me?\n\n578\n00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:48.600\nWell, check this out.\n\n579\n00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.850\nWhen I go over to Windows Explorer,\nI go over to my search,\n\n580\n00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:56.050\nI type the word salary, if I can spell it.\n\n581\n00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:58.520\nAnd there's my worksheet right there.\n\n582\n00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:03.077\nSo imagine going up to a shared location\nwhere there's hundreds of spreadsheets.\n\n583\n00:30:03.077 --> 00:30:07.460\nAnd you know one of those spreadsheets\nhas to deal with purchase orders.\n\n584\n00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:11.050\nWell, if the person that generated that\nspreadsheet took the time to add a tag\n\n585\n00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:13.010\npurchase order, you could search for it.\n\n586\n00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:16.130\nYou wouldn't have to remember the name\nof the workbook or anything like that.\n\n587\n00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:18.310\nYou can just search by tag.\n\n588\n00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:20.320\nAnd you can add as many tags as you want.\n\n589\n00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:24.220\nEven though this is called Employees,\nI could add salary.\n\n590\n00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:26.230\nWe could add again any tag that I want.\n\n591\n00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:29.685\nSo really, the benefit of being able\nto work with those properties is\n\n592\n00:30:29.685 --> 00:30:31.961\nto make it easier to\nlocate those documents.\n\n593\n00:30:31.961 --> 00:30:35.598\nEspecially when you have dozens or\nhundreds or hundreds and\n\n594\n00:30:35.598 --> 00:30:40.763\nhundreds of spreadsheets or when you're\ndealing with shared storage locations and\n\n595\n00:30:40.763 --> 00:30:45.127\nyou need to find a worksheet that you\nknow that somebody's tagged out of\n\n596\n00:30:45.127 --> 00:30:48.440\nthe hundreds of worksheets in there\n>> There's no doubt Mike,\n\n597\n00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:51.980\nthis is one of the problems, right,\nwith the way Excel work books are.\n\n598\n00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:54.370\nWe tend to be fairly\ngeneric with our naming.\n\n599\n00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:59.230\nSo Mike might name his salary_mr for\nMike Rodrick.\n\n600\n00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:03.790\nAnd I might name mine salary_rw for\nfor Ronnie Wong, but\n\n601\n00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:06.690\nthen of course 100 other people\nmight do the same thing.\n\n602\n00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:08.330\nOr we might all name our salary.\n\n603\n00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:11.733\nAnd they're actually individual and\ndifferent, and 1 2 3 4 or\n\n604\n00:31:11.733 --> 00:31:13.874\nwhatever it might be, and now here it is.\n\n605\n00:31:13.874 --> 00:31:16.960\nYou're looking at names like,\nI know I named it, crud.\n\n606\n00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.870\nAnd so\nbeing able to actually add in that tag, so\n\n607\n00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:23.300\nthat you can find yours among\na very common shared storage\n\n608\n00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:28.200\nis really incredibly helpful because if\nnot you're gonna do like I do, right?\n\n609\n00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:31.050\nYou just open up everything real quick,\nand go, no that's not mine,\n\n610\n00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:32.920\nno that's not mine, this is mine.\n\n611\n00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:36.720\nAnd then you start working and\nyour realize, that really isn't mine.\n\n612\n00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.662\nAnd you're just hoping you didn't\nactually hit save and save the changes.\n\n613\n00:31:39.662 --> 00:31:43.198\n>> Yep, and even if you remember\nthe name of the document,\n\n614\n00:31:43.198 --> 00:31:45.620\nwhat if that list is a mile long.\n\n615\n00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:47.890\nJust by searching up there\nin that tag field or\n\n616\n00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:52.110\nthat search field, makes it really easy\nto jump right to that document as well.\n\n617\n00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:54.690\nSo it really is a handy feature.\n\n618\n00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:56.940\nIt's one that probably\nmost people don't use, and\n\n619\n00:31:56.940 --> 00:32:00.390\nit's something that I think more of\nus should use, including myself.\n\n620\n00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:05.630\n>> Excellent Mike, well we do thank you\nfor showing us how we can take the default\n\n621\n00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:10.550\ninstall of Excel 2016 And be able to\ncustomize it to make it more effective\n\n622\n00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:14.100\nto the way that we want to\nbe able to use Excel 2016.\n\n623\n00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:15.930\nIt allows us to be more productive.\n\n624\n00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:20.340\nIt allows us to make sure that we\ncan actually use it more effectively\n\n625\n00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:22.380\nto whatever we're actually doing.\n\n626\n00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:24.010\nAnd there's actually even more,\nisn't there?\n\n627\n00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:25.886\n>> There is, there's some really\ncool stuff coming up, but\n\n628\n00:32:25.886 --> 00:32:27.889\nI know you're getting ready to\ntell me I've talked too long.\n\n629\n00:32:27.889 --> 00:32:28.539\n>> Yes, you have.\n\n630\n00:32:28.539 --> 00:32:30.217\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] We'll save that for\n\n631\n00:32:30.217 --> 00:32:30.910\nthe next episode.\n\n632\n00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:31.750\nThat's our cliffhanger,\n\n633\n00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:35.360\nkeep you on the edge of the couch, hoping\nthat you come back and watch the next one.\n\n634\n00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:39.020\n>> All right, well that's a great place\nfor us to go ahead and sign off for today.\n\n635\n00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.500\nSigning off for ITPro.TV.\n\n636\n00:32:40.500 -->

Productivity and Efficiency and keys to working better with Excel.  They show us how to customize the ribbon and the quick access toolbar (QAT).  They emphasize how customizing these tools makes working in Excel more intuitive for the user.  The guys emphasize the use of Macros within the workbook and the need to secure them too since macros can be changed easily and run not only within that excel workbook but the commands can affect the entire computer system.",

00:00:17.763\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.763 --> 00:00:22.030\ntoday we're gonna be taking\na look at Microsoft Excel 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.010\nNow, we're actually going into a part two.\n\n6\n00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.350\nWe're talking about customizing views,\nthe earlier version of this, right?\n\n7\n00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.030\nWe took a look at some of the tools that\nwe need to make sure that we understand\n\n8\n00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.920\nand figure out how to work\nwith our documents better.\n\n9\n00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.670\nBut, now, we're actually gonna find\nout how we can actually improve in our\n\n10\n00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.075\nefficiency and who better to help us than,\nwell, the Excel master himself, Mr.\n\n11\n00:00:43.075 --> 00:00:43.930\nMike Roderick?\n\n12\n00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:44.618\nHow's it going, Mike?\n\n13\n00:00:44.618 --> 00:00:46.522\n>> Uh-oh, I thought you were\ngonna help us with that.\n\n14\n00:00:46.522 --> 00:00:47.718\n>> Well, no, you are.\n\n15\n00:00:47.718 --> 00:00:50.600\n>> [LAUGH] Okay, just kidding,\nyes, I'm glad to be here.\n\n16\n00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.033\nThanks Ronnie for having me and\n\n17\n00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:54.860\nwe are getting ready to do some\nreally cool stuff with Excel.\n\n18\n00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.470\nWe are progressing our\nway through more and\n\n19\n00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.890\nmore advanced capabilities and\nthings like that.\n\n20\n00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.160\nAnd as Ronnie said, and so far we've\nreally been focusing on making us more\n\n21\n00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.100\nefficient using the program itself,\nlooking at different views that we have,\n\n22\n00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.220\ngetting used to the interface and\nthe different options, and\n\n23\n00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.880\nthat status bar and\nthe cool things we can do down there.\n\n24\n00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.618\nAnd we're gonna continue that along as\nRonnie said here with our part two.\n\n25\n00:01:19.618 --> 00:01:23.044\nThe next thing we really want to take\na look at is customizing what we\n\n26\n00:01:23.044 --> 00:01:26.528\ncall the Quick Access Toolbar, or\nthe QAT as you'll read about it in\n\n27\n00:01:26.528 --> 00:01:30.588\nsome of the Microsoft texts, if you got\nout there and do some searches online.\n\n28\n00:01:30.588 --> 00:01:33.480\nI don't like calling it that,\nI call it the Quick Access Toolbar,\n\n29\n00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.890\nbut the QAT does have a nice ring to it,\nI guess.\n\n30\n00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.190\nAnyway, we actually saw a little bit of\nthis in one of our previous episodes.\n\n31\n00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.370\nNow we're gonna take a closer look at\nsome of the things we can do with that\n\n32\n00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.850\nQuick Access Toolbar.\n\n33\n00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.120\nSo let's take a look at my screen here.\n\n34\n00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.150\nI've just got a, it doesn't really\nmatter what workbook we have open.\n\n35\n00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.180\nBut, up in that top right-hand, I'm sorry,\n\n36\n00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.910\ntop left-hand corner,\nremember these icons right up here,\n\n37\n00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.310\nabove my ribbons and my tabs, that was\nthe area we call the Quick Access Toolbar.\n\n38\n00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.978\nAnd I've reset my\ncustomizations from that one\n\n39\n00:02:03.978 --> 00:02:08.376\nepisode where we added Print to this\nQuick Access Toolbar, so we can start with\n\n40\n00:02:08.376 --> 00:02:12.398\nwhat it looks like when you go in there\nand we'll see what we can change.\n\n41\n00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:16.568\nSo by default you get Save, Undo and Redo.\n\n42\n00:02:16.568 --> 00:02:18.403\nThose are the only guys that are on there,\nbut\n\n43\n00:02:18.403 --> 00:02:20.398\nthat's definitely not\nwhat we're limited to.\n\n44\n00:02:20.398 --> 00:02:25.668\nThere's a little dropdown list right here\nat the end of the Quick Access Toolbar.\n\n45\n00:02:25.668 --> 00:02:30.120\nAnd when you hover over it, you can see\nit says, customize Quick Access Toolbar.\n\n46\n00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.010\nSo I'm gonna hit that dropdown list,\nand here I get a menu.\n\n47\n00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.150\nThese are all the most common things that\nMicrosoft thinks you might wanna add\n\n48\n00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.210\nto your Quick Access Toolbar, like New.\n\n49\n00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.020\nSo when I wanna create a new file,\ninstead of going File, and then New,\n\n50\n00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.650\ngo to that backstage area, then click New,\nI could add the New button,\n\n51\n00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.560\nright out here to my Quick Access Toolbar.\n\n52\n00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.560\nAnd if I click it now,\nit just opens up a blank document.\n\n53\n00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.000\nSo if you're a person that's\nconstantly making new documents and\n\n54\n00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.050\ngetting them ready for other people, or\n\n55\n00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.800\nwhatever the case may be, maybe you\nwanna have that out there, right?\n\n56\n00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.685\nThis is what you wanna think about,\nwhat things do I do all the time that\n\n57\n00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:09.585\ntake more than one step to get to,\ntypically, like I have to go to the File,\n\n58\n00:03:09.585 --> 00:03:12.125\nthe backstage area, and\nthen I have to click New,\n\n59\n00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:16.165\nand then I have to decide if it's\na blank workbook or a template.\n\n60\n00:03:16.165 --> 00:03:18.625\nI never use templates,\nI just create blank workbooks.\n\n61\n00:03:18.625 --> 00:03:21.361\nWhen I go to button,\nthat'll do just that, right,\n\n62\n00:03:21.361 --> 00:03:23.550\njust opens up that blank workbook for me.\n\n63\n00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.750\nAnd you can see there's\nseveral options on this list.\n\n64\n00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.510\nNew is one of them, I'll take that off,\noops, take that off of there.\n\n65\n00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.080\nNew, Open, so if you open a lot of,\nif you're constantly working with\n\n66\n00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.240\nother people's workbooks or\nworkbooks that you've created already and\n\n67\n00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.550\nyou have to go back in and\nwork with them everyday,\n\n68\n00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.990\nmaybe you wanna put that open list right\nthere on your Quick Access Toolbar.\n\n69\n00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.570\nEmail, Quick Print, Print Preview,\nnow Print Preview is what I like cuz\n\n70\n00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.980\nthere's really not a lot of Print Preview\noptions like you go to File,\n\n71\n00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.500\nthe backstage area, and then print and\nyou get that print preview.\n\n72\n00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.970\nWell now I got it right out here and\nI can just click it and there we go.\n\n73\n00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.650\nI can take a look at my document and\nthen get out of that print preview.\n\n74\n00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.380\nOops, let's not do that.\n\n75\n00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.115\nYou zoomed in, I can't tell which close,\nI'm clicking there.\n\n76\n00:04:10.115 --> 00:04:11.835\nAnd so anyway,\nI won't go through every one of them.\n\n77\n00:04:11.835 --> 00:04:15.605\nYou get the idea, these are what we\ncan add right here but that's not all.\n\n78\n00:04:15.605 --> 00:04:19.695\nThere is one we'll point out,\ntouch mouse mode is kind of cool.\n\n79\n00:04:19.695 --> 00:04:22.585\nIf you use a touchscreen,\nlike I know we used to\n\n80\n00:04:22.585 --> 00:04:25.865\nhave those XPSs that had a touchscreen,\nor if you work on a tablet or\n\n81\n00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:29.175\nany device, you've got a big view\nsonic monitor that's touch and\n\n82\n00:04:29.175 --> 00:04:34.500\nyou like to do that, you can switch\nbetween touch and mouse mode.\n\n83\n00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.250\nAnd when you do the optimize for touch,\nsee how everything got a little bit\n\n84\n00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.830\nbigger, because when I'm using my finger,\nit's easy to, with that smaller mode,\n\n85\n00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.650\nyou can end up clicking on\nthe wrong button, right?\n\n86\n00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.080\nBut if we do this switch to touch mode,\neverything's a little bit bigger,\n\n87\n00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.450\nlittle bit easier to hit\nit with your finger.\n\n88\n00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.650\nBut, again,\nnot really what we're here to learn.\n\n89\n00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.720\nWe wanna learn about this\nQuick Access Toolbar,\n\n90\n00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.590\nbut thought that was a cool\noption to point out.\n\n91\n00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.060\n>> Now, Mike,\nthe location that it's actually,\n\n92\n00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.100\nessentially adds in not too much to the\noriginal view, but is there a way I can\n\n93\n00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.530\nmove that Quick Access Toolbar to say,\nlike underneath the ribbons?\n\n94\n00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.450\n>> You can, there's an option\nright down here at the bottom,\n\n95\n00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.240\nthere's a show below ribbon.\n\n96\n00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.510\nCuz what you'll find is if I start\nadding a bunch of commands, and\n\n97\n00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.767\nlet's just go through here and\nadd a few different ones,\n\n98\n00:05:20.767 --> 00:05:24.270\nyou'll see,\nit's kinda creeping across the top there.\n\n99\n00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.530\nAre we out of commands?\n\n100\n00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.470\nYou notice I get to the end and\nI just had to bump the title over.\n\n101\n00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.420\nIt did give me a little more room there.\n\n102\n00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.530\nBut if you wanna put a whole\nstring of these across here\n\n103\n00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.620\nwhat you might end up doing is\nmoving that below the ribbon.\n\n104\n00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.810\nSo now my Quick Access Toolbar\nis down here.\n\n105\n00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.740\nI could then minimize that ribbon for\nexample, and now my Quick Access Toolbar\n\n106\n00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.996\nis right there, and I've got more\nroom to add additional icons there.\n\n107\n00:05:51.996 --> 00:05:54.190\nSo definitely something new,\nif you don't like it there,\n\n108\n00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.390\nyou can move back show above ribbon.\n\n109\n00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.210\nAnd I'm gonna bring that ribbon back out.\n\n110\n00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.900\nSo it looks like that and\nthat's not all, right?\n\n111\n00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.410\nThis is just a list of commands that\nMicrosoft thinks I might wanna add to that\n\n112\n00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:09.740\nQuick Access Toolbar.\n\n113\n00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:16.830\nI can always go to More Commands, and\nI can find whatever I want, any command.\n\n114\n00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.460\nYou can filter this down, by default\nit starts with popular commands.\n\n115\n00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.010\nYou can find commands that\naren't located in any ribbon.\n\n116\n00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.240\nMaybe there's something that I\nuse a lot that I wanna find.\n\n117\n00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.420\nYou can go to, you can look for\nmacro commands, and\n\n118\n00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:32.330\nyou can do whatever you want.\n\n119\n00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.980\nIf you need formulas,\nthere's all the stuff.\n\n120\n00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.250\nSo, you can pick any one of those and\nput them out there in that quick access.\n\n121\n00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.720\nAnd you'll notice where we ended up,\nwhen we chose, and\n\n122\n00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.620\nI'm gonna do that one more time for you,\nwent to that Quick Access Toolbar, and\n\n123\n00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.349\nchose More Commands, what it did\nwas it opened up my Excel options.\n\n124\n00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:54.640\nWe can get to the Excel options\nfrom that backstage area as well.\n\n125\n00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.230\nIf I go File > Options,\n\n126\n00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:01.850\nwell here's my Quick Access Toolbar and\nI'm right there in the same place.\n\n127\n00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:05.586\nSo you can go straight to the Options and\ndo it there as well.\n\n128\n00:07:05.586 --> 00:07:07.600\nIf I'm gonna ahead reset mine,\n\n129\n00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.780\nif you ever customize yours and\nyou decide you wanna undo all of that, or\n\n130\n00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.510\nmaybe you're using a machine that somebody\nelse had been using in the past and\n\n131\n00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:19.550\nsome of their customizations has gotten in\nthere, you can always reset that by going\n\n132\n00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:25.286\nto Reset and then Reset\nthe Quick Access Toolbar, and Yes.\n\n133\n00:07:25.286 --> 00:07:29.630\nAnd OK, and you see I'm back\nto the standard three there.\n\n134\n00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:34.290\nSo, very easy to do it again, the whole\nidea is to make you more efficient,\n\n135\n00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:37.890\nright, things that you do a lot that you\ndon't wanna have hunt for on our ribbon.\n\n136\n00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.710\nEven if it's already out there on the\nribbon that doesn't mean you can't add it\n\n137\n00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.462\nto the Quick Access Toolbar.\n\n138\n00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:45.058\nI'm gonna show you how to\ncustomize the ribbons as well.\n\n139\n00:07:45.058 --> 00:07:48.681\nBut the Quick Access Toolbar for\nthings you do all the time,\n\n140\n00:07:48.681 --> 00:07:52.028\nI especially like adding Print,\nPreview and my Open.\n\n141\n00:07:52.028 --> 00:07:55.240\nThose are the two big ones I typically\nadd to that Quick Access Toolbar.\n\n142\n00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.080\n>> Yeah, Mike, I think you hit\nthe nail on the head about the idea of\n\n143\n00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.540\nefficiency here, right?\n\n144\n00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.480\nThe idea of the Quick Access Toolbar\nreally gives us a one-click\n\n145\n00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.282\neasy access to that tool immediately.\n\n146\n00:08:04.282 --> 00:08:06.416\nWhereas, sometimes you do realize,\n\n147\n00:08:06.416 --> 00:08:09.400\nlike what Mike was saying\na little bit ago here.\n\n148\n00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.600\nThat if it takes you three or\nfour clicks, right?\n\n149\n00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.340\nBefore you can find that tool that\nyou need or you have to go and\n\n150\n00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.900\nsearch in the ribbons.\n\n151\n00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:19.150\nAnd if you're like me you don't remember\nwhere they are in terms of the tabs.\n\n152\n00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.140\nWell, that takes you a lot of time.\n\n153\n00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.990\nIf you know that these are the tools\nthat you are gonna use most often,\n\n154\n00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:26.980\nyou are essentially building\nyourself a little toolbar\n\n155\n00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.440\nthat all you now need is a single click.\n\n156\n00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.987\nIf you think about efficiency\ncompared to three or\n\n157\n00:08:31.987 --> 00:08:34.520\nfour clicks for everything that\nI need to do, being able to say,\n\n158\n00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.750\nhey a single click that's\nabout as efficient as you get.\n\n159\n00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:41.650\nIf you really will use them efficiently,\nand only put those tools that you need for\n\n160\n00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:44.180\nthat moment up there, it does help.\n\n161\n00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:45.360\nNow there does come a point,\n\n162\n00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.450\nlike Mike was showing us where you can\nstretch it all the way across the screen,\n\n163\n00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:51.560\nwell after a while, if you don't\nknow what those icons are, right?\n\n164\n00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.320\nYou're still gonna be searching for\nthem in that quick access toolbar, so\n\n165\n00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.220\nit can be self-defeating at the same time.\n\n166\n00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:01.500\nReset it, start back over here, and really\nonly put the essential tools that you\n\n167\n00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.550\nneed, and\nit'll become a very good help for\n\n168\n00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:06.420\nyou, and you'll become faster\nat working with Excel.\n\n169\n00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.321\n>> Absolutely, all right,\nlet's take a look,\n\n170\n00:09:08.321 --> 00:09:11.512\nanother place that we can do some\ncustomization are the ribbons themselves.\n\n171\n00:09:11.512 --> 00:09:16.715\nIf you remember when Office first went to\nribbons, and gosh Ronnie, was it 2003?\n\n172\n00:09:16.715 --> 00:09:17.464\n>> 2007.\n\n173\n00:09:17.464 --> 00:09:21.451\n>> 2007 Office first went to ribbons,\nand prior to that,\n\n174\n00:09:21.451 --> 00:09:25.370\nin 2003 and prior,\nwe could do custom menus, right?\n\n175\n00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:29.840\nAnd a lot of us used that capability,\nbecause I could create my own dropdown\n\n176\n00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.450\nmenu that had all the stuff\nthat I liked to use.\n\n177\n00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:35.770\nAnd then when they went in 2007,\nand the ribbons first came out,\n\n178\n00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:39.250\nthere really wasn't a way to\ncustomize those ribbons at the time.\n\n179\n00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:42.990\nIt was a very difficult process,\nthey didn't make it easy.\n\n180\n00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:46.760\nWell, if they heard the people talking\nabout that, wanting to be able to\n\n181\n00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.710\ncustomize those ribbons, and\nthey've definitely fixed that.\n\n182\n00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:54.120\nAnd now it's as easy as customizing\nthe quick access toolbar, actually.\n\n183\n00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.050\nLet me show you how to do it.\n\n184\n00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:57.160\nWhat I'm talking about\nhere is our ribbons.\n\n185\n00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.390\nWe've got our standard ribbon layout here.\n\n186\n00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.350\nIf we want to create our own ribbons,\n\n187\n00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:04.980\nmodify existing ribbons,\nwe have that capability.\n\n188\n00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:09.170\nIt's the same place if I go File and\nthen Options.\n\n189\n00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:14.140\nI come back in here and then just above\nQuick Access Toolbar is Customize Ribbon.\n\n190\n00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:15.850\nNow there's a little dialog box.\n\n191\n00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:16.700\nYou've got the,\n\n192\n00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:21.430\non the left hand side, it's really\nshowing me all the possible commands.\n\n193\n00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:25.010\nThere's a filter drop down at the top,\nand it says popular commands.\n\n194\n00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.300\nAnd so what I'm seeing here in this list\n\n195\n00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.420\nare what somebody considers\nthe most popular commands.\n\n196\n00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.160\nWell, if I hit that drop down list.\n\n197\n00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.560\nI can show commands that\nare not in the ribbon.\n\n198\n00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.670\nSo these are things that don't even\nshow up in any of the ribbons.\n\n199\n00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.599\nSo if these are tools that you use.\n\n200\n00:10:39.599 --> 00:10:43.587\nIf you create a lot of forms, or\nyou work with a lot of drawings, and\n\n201\n00:10:43.587 --> 00:10:46.508\nyou need to bring things forwards or\nbackwards,\n\n202\n00:10:46.508 --> 00:10:50.305\nI don't do a lot of drawings in Excel,\nbut maybe some of you do.\n\n203\n00:10:50.305 --> 00:10:55.421\nI'm trying to think of some other\nones you might find useful here.\n\n204\n00:10:55.421 --> 00:10:59.635\nAnd if you have shadows, if you want\nto nudge them left and right and down.\n\n205\n00:10:59.635 --> 00:11:02.345\nThese paste,\nI like some of these paste options.\n\n206\n00:11:02.345 --> 00:11:06.035\nThey actually are on my ribbon\nunderneath my paste dropdown list, but\n\n207\n00:11:06.035 --> 00:11:08.973\nthey're not right out there\nwhere I have to get to them,\n\n208\n00:11:08.973 --> 00:11:12.554\nagain like Ronnie was saying,\nmore than one click to do something.\n\n209\n00:11:12.554 --> 00:11:15.040\nSo you can see there's\na whole lot of them.\n\n210\n00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:15.870\nThat we can add there.\n\n211\n00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:17.850\nAnd again, this is just filtering.\n\n212\n00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:19.840\nSo I can show all commands.\n\n213\n00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.280\nSo this is every single command out there.\n\n214\n00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.409\nAnd I'm gonna go through these one at\na time until we know, I'm just kidding.\n\n215\n00:11:26.409 --> 00:11:28.410\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right, but\n\n216\n00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:32.490\nthese are all the different\ncommands that we could have.\n\n217\n00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:33.720\nThere's the different tabs.\n\n218\n00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.890\nHere's File tab,\nhere's the Main tabs out there.\n\n219\n00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:41.540\nAnd I can see the Home ribbon and\nthe Formulas ribbon.\n\n220\n00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.487\nSo you can drill down appointees,\nyou can drill down and\n\n221\n00:11:43.487 --> 00:11:45.170\nfind the command you're looking for.\n\n222\n00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:48.570\nOver on the right hand side,\nthis is what you're trying to customize.\n\n223\n00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:50.780\nSo you can see, right,\nI have the Main tabs.\n\n224\n00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:51.950\nHere's my Home ribbon.\n\n225\n00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:55.465\nThis is the stuff that already\nexists on that Home ribbon.\n\n226\n00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:57.878\nWell, I can actually move things around.\n\n227\n00:11:57.878 --> 00:12:01.642\nLet me see if I can get\na little closer in here.\n\n228\n00:12:01.642 --> 00:12:05.711\nFor the existing ribbons, let's go to,\nI don't know, that Insert ribbon or\n\n229\n00:12:05.711 --> 00:12:08.505\nsomething, or and\nwe'll do it with the home ribbon.\n\n230\n00:12:08.505 --> 00:12:12.977\nSo I can take that numbers group, remember\nthe numbers has like my formatting,\n\n231\n00:12:12.977 --> 00:12:14.391\npercent, comma style.\n\n232\n00:12:14.391 --> 00:12:18.880\nAnd I'll zoom out and I can show you\nmaybe, if it will let me click on it.\n\n233\n00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.670\nRight, there is that numbers section.\n\n234\n00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:23.770\nThere's there's the general and\nthe currency and the percent and\n\n235\n00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:28.490\nthe comma style and things like that,\nwell here's those same options in here.\n\n236\n00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:32.340\nIf I want to move this around, right?\n\n237\n00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:34.000\nI use that a lot,\nI wanna put it up to the front.\n\n238\n00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:40.490\nI go and click okay, and now numbers\nis way over here next to clipboard.\n\n239\n00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:44.090\nJust rearranging things that\nall ready exist on the ribbons\n\n240\n00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:46.170\nmight make you more efficient, all right.\n\n241\n00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:50.580\nRemoving some of this stuff, remember how\nI said that as we reduce our resolution or\n\n242\n00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:53.110\nsize, things get compacted up.\n\n243\n00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:55.270\nIt can't show you all of the nice,\n\n244\n00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:59.270\npretty buttons that we lost that\nreal estate on our monitor.\n\n245\n00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:04.080\nWell, if you never use styles and\neverything else is all crunched up\n\n246\n00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.680\nbecause you're on a smaller monitor,\njust get rid of styles on the ribbon.\n\n247\n00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.960\nIt's not like you're losing\nthat capability all together.\n\n248\n00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.950\nBut you're freeing up some\nspace on that ribbon.\n\n249\n00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:17.890\nSo I can go into here,\nI can find Styles, right?\n\n250\n00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:22.047\nAnd I can just remove that guy,\nI should be able to.\n\n251\n00:13:22.047 --> 00:13:24.714\nI right-click on it and Remove.\n\n252\n00:13:24.714 --> 00:13:28.370\nAnd I click OK, and styles is gone,\nwhich frees up more space for\n\n253\n00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:29.880\nother commands, right?\n\n254\n00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.249\nAnd allows it to show more details\nwith those other commands.\n\n255\n00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.180\n>> So Mike, you had mentioned earlier,\n\n256\n00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.450\nthat the idea of customizing\nribbons really does help.\n\n257\n00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:41.140\nBut you also mentioned that\nwe can create our own ribbon.\n\n258\n00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.850\nSo let me ask a question here, one,\n\n259\n00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:46.360\nwhy would I ever choose\nto create my own ribbon?\n\n260\n00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.670\nAnd then, two, how would I do it?\n\n261\n00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.340\n>> Okay, let’s have a look at that.\n\n262\n00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:55.740\nI like to create my own ribbons because I\ncan take commands that I use all the time.\n\n263\n00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.910\nThat are located on different\nribbons by default, right?\n\n264\n00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:02.420\nThere's some things that I'm always doing\nevery time I work with a spreadsheet.\n\n265\n00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:06.410\nI'm working with the clipboard\ninformation, my alignment information\n\n266\n00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:11.920\ntypically, I'm also inserting tables\na lot of times, and hyperlinks.\n\n267\n00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.140\nWhat else do I do a lot?\n\n268\n00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:14.464\nI do a lot with the.\n\n269\n00:14:16.725 --> 00:14:18.176\nLet's see if I can find\nanything else here.\n\n270\n00:14:18.176 --> 00:14:21.669\nThat's most of what I\nfind myself looking for.\n\n271\n00:14:21.669 --> 00:14:23.625\nMaybe doing some getting internal data.\n\n272\n00:14:23.625 --> 00:14:27.395\nI do a lot of formula work but\nI don't really use the two bars as much.\n\n273\n00:14:27.395 --> 00:14:28.785\nBut those are two different ribbons,\nright?\n\n274\n00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:31.195\nI have to go here,\nthis is what I find myself doing a lot.\n\n275\n00:14:31.195 --> 00:14:36.835\nGoing here and formatting something and\nthen go over here and inserting something.\n\n276\n00:14:36.835 --> 00:14:40.315\nAnd then going back over here and\ncentering it and things like that,\n\n277\n00:14:40.315 --> 00:14:43.220\nwell that's a lot of time that I'm doing.\n\n278\n00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:43.920\nWe're wasting there.\n\n279\n00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:48.972\nSo if I go File, Options, and\nI can go down to customize the ribbon,\n\n280\n00:14:48.972 --> 00:14:52.714\nand I can go ahead and\ncreate a new tab, all right.\n\n281\n00:14:52.714 --> 00:14:57.426\nAnd within that new tab, I've got this\nnew group, and I might rename that.\n\n282\n00:14:57.426 --> 00:15:01.495\nAnd I'm gonna call it my clipboard,\nor I'll call it,\n\n283\n00:15:01.495 --> 00:15:03.975\nyeah I'll call it my clipboard.\n\n284\n00:15:03.975 --> 00:15:06.678\nAnd I could even pick\na fancy icon if I wanted to.\n\n285\n00:15:06.678 --> 00:15:08.936\nI'm not gonna take the time\nto do that here, but\n\n286\n00:15:08.936 --> 00:15:11.713\nnormally I'd spend an hour\npicking the right icon for it.\n\n287\n00:15:11.713 --> 00:15:15.991\n[LAUGH] So now I've got this new, on that\ntab remember, you create tab as the ribbon\n\n288\n00:15:15.991 --> 00:15:19.780\nitself, and then you've got the groups\nof commands that exist on that.\n\n289\n00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.850\nSo to add a command to the ribbon,\n\n290\n00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:24.840\nyou've got to create a group\nto put that command in.\n\n291\n00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:29.090\nSo now I've got my clipboard, and what I\nwould probably add to that is I would come\n\n292\n00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:34.450\nover here to my,\nlet's see I can go to All Commands and\n\n293\n00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:38.390\nfind that or we can do main tab,\nI know it's there.\n\n294\n00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:42.600\nI can go to home, I can go to Clipboard,\nI can go to Paste.\n\n295\n00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.620\nAnd I love the paste values,\nwhich I don't see on there.\n\n296\n00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:50.100\nSo I'm gonna go to All Commands,\nall right.\n\n297\n00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:55.618\nAnd I'll go down to Paste.\n\n298\n00:15:55.618 --> 00:15:57.198\nScroll a little bit slower.\n\n299\n00:15:57.198 --> 00:16:00.726\nAnd let's do a Paste Special.\n\n300\n00:16:00.726 --> 00:16:03.559\nWhere is my paste values,\nthey're not going to give it to me.\n\n301\n00:16:03.559 --> 00:16:05.000\nI'll go find it here in a second.\n\n302\n00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.850\nI'll go ahead and add paste special but\nwhat I really want is past values so\n\n303\n00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:10.910\nlet me go to commands not in the ribbon.\n\n304\n00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:16.900\nWhy it shows up in here and not in the all\ncommands Kind of a curious thing, right?\n\n305\n00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:19.920\nWe'll have to talk to Microsoft\nabout that, but paste values.\n\n306\n00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:23.840\nCuz I'm constantly copying\nthings from other sources and\n\n307\n00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:26.650\nwhen I paste them in, I don't want\nto include the formatting, and\n\n308\n00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:30.430\nthings like that cuz it came from the web\nand it's bigger, it's a bigger font or\n\n309\n00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:32.170\nit's a different color or\nthings like that.\n\n310\n00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:36.000\nI just wanna paste the values, or\nI'll show you some tricks that I do with\n\n311\n00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.660\nformulas where I need the data,\nbut not the formulas anymore.\n\n312\n00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:44.420\nSo I'll copy the data off and paste just\nthe values and not the formulas, but\n\n313\n00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.070\nagain I'll talk more about that.\n\n314\n00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:49.810\nSo I might add those and I might come\nup here and add another group, and\n\n315\n00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:52.550\nI'll call this one my insert.\n\n316\n00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.670\nWhoops, let me do,\nI'm gonna get rid of that one,\n\n317\n00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:57.230\nsorry I clicked that\na little too fast there.\n\n318\n00:16:57.230 --> 00:17:00.600\nI'm gonna remove that one and\nthis one, we're gonna rename, and\n\n319\n00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:07.250\nI'm going to call this my insert,\nand on this one one I'm going to do,\n\n320\n00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:13.380\nand again I'm just showing you what\nI might do, you do what you need.\n\n321\n00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.640\nWhere is insert hyperlink?\n\n322\n00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:21.010\nSometimes finding the commands that\nyou want to add can be fun, but\n\n323\n00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:22.040\nat least it's alphabetical.\n\n324\n00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:29.230\nInsert, and I still don't see hyperlink.\n\n325\n00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.510\n>> H's?\n[LAUGH]\n\n326\n00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.490\n>> You would think right?\n\n327\n00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:38.420\nWe'll do insert, I do this a lot,\ninsert table rows above.\n\n328\n00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:40.260\nInsert table rows below.\n\n329\n00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.600\nI definitely want those in there.\n\n330\n00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.240\nAnyway, we're not going to spend a lot of\ntime on doing it the way I would do it,\n\n331\n00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.730\nI'll just go ahead and click OK because\nI think you get the idea, right?\n\n332\n00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:55.490\nIt was create, and let me rename this,\nI'll call this My Tab, and we'll click OK,\n\n333\n00:17:55.490 --> 00:18:00.020\nso you create your ribbon or your tab,\nthen you create groups on that tab, and\n\n334\n00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:05.160\nthen you add commands to the different\ngroups, and then we click OK And\n\n335\n00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:08.630\nnow I've got my tab, and\nit's got the things that I do.\n\n336\n00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:11.780\nEven though those are already\nout there on other ribbons,\n\n337\n00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:15.270\nnow it's all located on the same ribbon,\nand I don't find myself flipping back,\n\n338\n00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:19.030\nand forth between the different ribbons\nto click these different commands.\n\n339\n00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:20.650\nSo again,\nit's all about being more efficient.\n\n340\n00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:23.070\nDoes it make Excel work any better?\n\n341\n00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:23.730\nNot really.\n\n342\n00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:24.930\nWe're not adding functionality.\n\n343\n00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:26.780\nAll that stuff is already there.\n\n344\n00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.550\nI'm just organizing it in\na way that makes it easier for\n\n345\n00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:32.520\nme to work with Excel, and\nthat's what's all about, right?\n\n346\n00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:37.410\nThat's the great thing about this 2016\nOffice is that it let's you set it up for\n\n347\n00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:41.390\nthe way you work with it because\neverybody work a little bit differently.\n\n348\n00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:43.570\nYou might not like The ribbon thing.\n\n349\n00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:46.570\nYou might like that quick\naccess toolbar a lot more.\n\n350\n00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:47.960\nSo maybe you hide the ribbon and\n\n351\n00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.900\nyou put everything out on\nthe quick access toolbar.\n\n352\n00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:52.030\nThere's no wrong way whatever works for\nyou and\n\n353\n00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:53.740\nmakes you more efficient\nwith your spreadsheets.\n\n354\n00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:57.320\n>> There's no doubt that this idea of\nbeing able to create our own ribbon or\n\n355\n00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:01.570\ncustomize ribbons to the more our liking\nis really going to help us to be more\n\n356\n00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:04.480\nefficient because now\n>> Instead of accepting the default\n\n357\n00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:08.650\nlayout, and then trying to change it, or\nnot trying to change it, or trying to work\n\n358\n00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:11.650\nwith it, and you go, that doesn't\nlogically fit where it needs to be.\n\n359\n00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:13.940\nYou can move it around, and\nthat is the great thing about Excel.\n\n360\n00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:18.180\nIt is completely customizable in that\nparticular way, when we need to.\n\n361\n00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:23.010\nNow, Mike, there's a lot of times, though,\nthat when we are making workbooks for\n\n362\n00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:25.000\nother people, or even creating things, or\n\n363\n00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.740\nmultiple worksheets,\n>> That we have to do the same repetitive\n\n364\n00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:32.770\ntasks over and over again, and\nwhen I think about that, I get bored, and\n\n365\n00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:36.220\nnot only that though, I tend to start\ncreating them in different ways, and\n\n366\n00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:39.250\nI've seen that, especially with\nthings like formulas and stuff, but\n\n367\n00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:42.040\nI end up getting wrong\ninformation sometimes, so\n\n368\n00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:44.540\nwhat can I do to help me to\nbe more efficient at that?\n\n369\n00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:48.230\n>> We can record macros, Ronnie, we can\nactually start automating this process.\n\n370\n00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:52.140\nNow, what he's referring to there is there\nare things that you do over and over,\n\n371\n00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.510\nthat you have to do on a repetitive basis.\n\n372\n00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:59.550\nLike, for example, I'm gonna show\nyou how I get data from a database.\n\n373\n00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:03.870\nMy database guy sends me this\ndata every day or every week and\n\n374\n00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:06.980\nI have to put it in a spread sheet,\nand then I have to go back in and\n\n375\n00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:10.315\nformat that the spreadsheet and\nadd some things and get it ready for\n\n376\n00:20:10.315 --> 00:20:13.935\npresentation to the higher-ups\nwhen I go to do my reports.\n\n377\n00:20:13.935 --> 00:20:16.125\nSo, it's the same thing over and over.\n\n378\n00:20:16.125 --> 00:20:21.675\nSometimes, I forget wait what font\nsize did I use that made it look good?\n\n379\n00:20:21.675 --> 00:20:24.555\nDid I change a color,\nwhat was the formula I did?\n\n380\n00:20:24.555 --> 00:20:27.790\nYou start forgetting things like that or\njust the fact that Gosh,\n\n381\n00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:29.180\nI have to do this again?\n\n382\n00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:34.150\nIf it's something you find yourself doing\nfive times a day or three times a week,\n\n383\n00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:37.100\nI mean, these are the things you\nwant to look at trying to automate.\n\n384\n00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:40.240\nMacros are all about automation, right.\n\n385\n00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:45.590\nIt's the ability to take the commands that\nwe do in Excel and write them out, or\n\n386\n00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:51.430\nbasically record them in a language known\nas VBA, or Visual Basic for Application.\n\n387\n00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:53.170\nNow don't worry we don't\nhave to learn VDA,\n\n388\n00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:57.070\nalthough if you want to we should get\ntogether, because that's a great language.\n\n389\n00:20:57.070 --> 00:21:02.180\nI love playing with VDA, but\nwe don't have to learn it.\n\n390\n00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:06.930\nMicrosoft in Office and in Excel has\nwhat we call a macro recorder, and\n\n391\n00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:11.110\nwhat it does it's basically like the old\nschool if you go back to my days with\n\n392\n00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:14.590\na tape recorder, right where you push the\nrecord button on the tape recorder, and\n\n393\n00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:16.640\nyou start talking,\nit records everything you're saying,\n\n394\n00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:20.900\nyou hit stop, you rewind it, you play\nit back, an it plays it back, right?\n\n395\n00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.370\nI'm teasing, I know we have\ndevices that can do this today.\n\n396\n00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:27.540\nIt kind of reminds me of those old school\ncassette tapes and things like that.\n\n397\n00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:28.990\nCuz that's basically\nwhat you're going to do.\n\n398\n00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:31.650\nYou're going to start this macro recorder.\n\n399\n00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:33.660\nThen you're going to just\ndo what you normally do.\n\n400\n00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:37.760\nClick on that cell, change the font,\ncenter it, click on another cell,\n\n401\n00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:42.940\ntype in a formula, do whatever it is\nyou do, and then hit stop recording,\n\n402\n00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:46.890\nand in the background what it's doing, is\nit's taking all the things that you do and\n\n403\n00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:49.520\nconverting them into VBA and\nsaving it, and then,\n\n404\n00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:54.360\nI can replay that set of commands any\ntime I need to perform that function.\n\n405\n00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.290\nWhat we probably don't need to know but\n\n406\n00:21:56.290 --> 00:22:01.820\nif we want to understand what's going on,\neverything we do when we click on a cell,\n\n407\n00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:06.500\nwhen I change that to bold, it's actually\nperforming visual basic application for\n\n408\n00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.120\napplication, the language\nin the background, right?\n\n409\n00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:13.340\nIt knows what it means to click on this\nbutton and it's performing a command in\n\n410\n00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:17.190\nthe background it's Hidden to us,\nand I'm gonna undo that there.\n\n411\n00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:20.460\nAll right, so that's all it's\ndoing is it's saving the steps and\n\n412\n00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:23.510\nthen it's going to replay\nthem any time we want.\n\n413\n00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:25.840\nNow, before we get into\nrecording the macros, though,\n\n414\n00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:29.060\nI do wanna take a minute to\ntalk about macro security.\n\n415\n00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:32.150\nIf you've watched the news or\nread any text sites or\n\n416\n00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:34.160\ntalked to your friends\naround the water cooler,\n\n417\n00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:39.760\nyou've probably heard about macro viruses\nor the fact that Macros can be dangerous.\n\n418\n00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.280\nIf you've ever gotten\na workbook sent to you or\n\n419\n00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.470\ndownloaded one from the Internet\nthat had a macro in it,\n\n420\n00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:47.180\nyou get the big warning across\nthe top of your spreadsheet.\n\n421\n00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:48.960\nHey, do you wanna allow macros?\n\n422\n00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.240\nDo you trust this?\n\n423\n00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.290\nWhat's the big deal?\n\n424\n00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:54.480\nIt's just recording steps\nthat I'm doing here in Excel.\n\n425\n00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:58.170\nWell the problem is VBA,\nthe language Visual Basic for\n\n426\n00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:00.850\nApplications, is a very powerful language.\n\n427\n00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:05.410\nIt does give me access to all\nthe commands that I can do in Excel, but\n\n428\n00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:09.160\nit also has access to the file system,\nmy computer.\n\n429\n00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.710\nIn other words, not just Excel,\n\n430\n00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:14.020\nall the stuff in my documents all\nthe other files on my computer.\n\n431\n00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:18.220\nI can use VBA to to save a file\nto those locations, right?\n\n432\n00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:22.930\nIn Excel, you can go file, save, browse\nto a location, and save your spreadsheet.\n\n433\n00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:24.110\nWell, that means in VBA,\n\n434\n00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:27.180\nthere are commands that allow\nme to browse the file system.\n\n435\n00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:31.020\nThere are commands in VBA that allow\nme to access the operating system.\n\n436\n00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:34.090\nThere are commands in VBA that\nallow me to access the network.\n\n437\n00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:36.080\nSo, if somebody's malicious,\n\n438\n00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:39.070\nThey can write a macro that does\nthings that you don't want it to do.\n\n439\n00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:42.470\nAll right, so\nyou have to be really careful with macros.\n\n440\n00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:46.560\nNot so much the one's you write, but\nthe one's you get from other people.\n\n441\n00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:49.760\nEspecially the one's you get from\nother people you don't know.\n\n442\n00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:52.940\nIf Ronnie sends me a workbook and\nit's got a macro in it.\n\n443\n00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:54.090\nI trust Ronnie, right?\n\n444\n00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:54.780\nLook at Ronnie.\n\n445\n00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:56.360\nWho would not trust this guy?\n\n446\n00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:58.160\nHe's got a trustworthy face.\n\n447\n00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:58.796\nRight?\nBut\n\n448\n00:23:58.796 --> 00:24:01.958\nif I download one from the internet\nfrom some site that says hey,\n\n449\n00:24:01.958 --> 00:24:03.785\ncheck out our free Excel workbooks.\n\n450\n00:24:03.785 --> 00:24:05.695\nThey've got these really\ncool micros in them.\n\n451\n00:24:05.695 --> 00:24:08.798\nOr even worse, they don't even bother\nto tell you there's a macro in there,\n\n452\n00:24:08.798 --> 00:24:11.480\nand you open it up and\nthat's when you get that warning.\n\n453\n00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.350\nThose are the ones I'm not sure about,\nright.\n\n454\n00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:15.600\nI want to be a little\nmore careful with those.\n\n455\n00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.520\nSo let's take a look at some of the\nsettings that Microsoft gives us to help\n\n456\n00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:20.610\nprotect us from those macros.\n\n457\n00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:25.360\nI'm gonna go back to the backstage area\nand I'm gonna go down to my options, and\n\n458\n00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:28.460\nin my options there is a trust center,\nall right?\n\n459\n00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:29.650\nI'll click on that and\n\n460\n00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:33.680\nthen there's a button over here on\nthe right that says Trust Center Settings.\n\n461\n00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:37.340\nIn here I've got several\ndifferent security options.\n\n462\n00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:40.300\nThe one we want to focus\non is Macro Settings,\n\n463\n00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:43.870\nand there are four settings that\nhave to do with macros here.\n\n464\n00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:45.229\nWell five really if we count this one.\n\n465\n00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:50.150\nNotice the default,\ndisable all macros with notification.\n\n466\n00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:54.760\nWhat that means is if you open a workbook\nwith a macro it's gonna block the macro,\n\n467\n00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:58.450\nbut it's gonna give you that yellow bar\nacross the top of your spread sheet, and\n\n468\n00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:02.150\nit's gonna you a choice, hey we're\nblocking macros just so you know.\n\n469\n00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:03.620\nDo you want to enable them?\n\n470\n00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:05.050\nAnd you can choose yes.\n\n471\n00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:08.170\nSo again, if it came from Ronnie, I can\ngo ahead and say, yeah, let them run.\n\n472\n00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:11.370\nIf it came from the Internet and I didn't\neven realize there was a macro in there,\n\n473\n00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:14.920\nmaybe I say, no, go ahead and\ncontinue to block that macro, right?\n\n474\n00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.720\nYou can do Disable all\nmacros without notification.\n\n475\n00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.670\nWell, in this case, you're just saying,\nI don't wanna run macros,\n\n476\n00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:23.260\ncuz it's gonna block them even\nif it came from Ronnie, and\n\n477\n00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:24.990\nit's not gonna give me the notification,\nso\n\n478\n00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:29.290\nit's not gonna give me the chance to\nsay yes, go ahead and run those macros.\n\n479\n00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:33.360\nWe can do disable macros except for\ndigitally signed macros.\n\n480\n00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.630\nIn larger environments,\n\n481\n00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:38.770\nif we're developing our own macros to be\nused in house, we might add what we call\n\n482\n00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:42.750\na digital signature which is\na way to prove the identity or\n\n483\n00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:47.280\nthe of the author of those macros, and\nthat the macros content hasn't changed.\n\n484\n00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.270\nThat's a really, it's for another day and\n\n485\n00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:53.040\nanother class but the idea is,\nbasically think of it like this.\n\n486\n00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:56.510\nSomebody's signing off in the macro\nsaying yes, this is safe.\n\n487\n00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:59.800\nAll right, and so\nmy computer can be set up to say hey,\n\n488\n00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:04.550\nanything that ITPro TV has signed And\nsays this macro is safe, I'll go ahead and\n\n489\n00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:08.210\ntrust it, or\nyou can do Enable all macros, but\n\n490\n00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:11.480\nnotice this is not recommended\nbnow you're just saying, meh,\n\n491\n00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:15.880\nI don't care, macros, no macros, whatever,\nopen up the workbook, let anything run.\n\n492\n00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:18.750\nI trust everybody and everything.\n\n493\n00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:20.720\nNot a good idea, right?\n\n494\n00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.280\nSo that's definitely not\none that we want to do.\n\n495\n00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:28.840\nMaybe, maybe,\nmaybe in a test environment where\n\n496\n00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:32.410\nI'm getting macros from other people,\nbut we're in an isolated environment.\n\n497\n00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:34.270\nThere's no chance of anything getting out.\n\n498\n00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:36.700\nThings like that,\nmaybe I could see using that option.\n\n499\n00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:41.150\nHonestly, disable all macros with\nnotification is typically where I leave\n\n500\n00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:43.140\nmine, because it gives me a chance for\n\n501\n00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:47.840\nevery workbook that I open to decide\nyes or no on the macros, right.\n\n502\n00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.580\nSo those are your options again\nthe default is a pretty good one.\n\n503\n00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:54.610\nIf your company does a lot of work with\nmacros and they're all digitally signed,\n\n504\n00:26:54.610 --> 00:26:57.220\nthis might be a good one to do,\nthen you wouldn't get that prompt.\n\n505\n00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:59.830\nIt would still block that\nmacros that weren't signed, but\n\n506\n00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:02.440\nanything that was signed it\njust wouldn't prompt you for.\n\n507\n00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.340\nSo we don't really have to\nworry about this one here.\n\n508\n00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:07.690\nIt's really dealing with,\nwe'll deal with it in other classes.\n\n509\n00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:11.240\nIf you're gonna write VBA, which is\na great topic and I love to do it,\n\n510\n00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:13.390\nthis is what we're talking about here.\n\n511\n00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:17.370\nWhether you can get access to\nthe actual VBA project model and\n\n512\n00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:22.160\nif the macros can, the problem with\nthis is people can start creating\n\n513\n00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:26.250\nmacros that generate other macros,\nthat do bad things, and\n\n514\n00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:30.640\nthis is a little bit complex, and\nyou can allow that if you want to.\n\n515\n00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:33.280\nMost of us will never have\na need to deal with that option.\n\n516\n00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:37.450\nSo we've got those options there for\nworking with the macro security.\n\n517\n00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:38.640\nPretty straightforward.\n\n518\n00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.830\nNow what I wanna show you is\nhow to actually write a macro.\n\n519\n00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:42.550\nAll right.\n\n520\n00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:45.480\nNow I've got a spreadsheet\nthat's got a few different tabs,\n\n521\n00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:49.320\nand if we think about the scenario\nthat I mentioned at the beginning,\n\n522\n00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:53.300\nmy DBA by my database\nguy exports this data\n\n523\n00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:58.290\non a monthly basis from our database where\nit's keeping track of all our sales.\n\n524\n00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:00.890\nHe gives that over to me as a CSV file.\n\n525\n00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:04.670\nI import that into Excel and\nit comes in looking like this, right.\n\n526\n00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:09.260\nWhich is very plain, all the text and\nthe numbers just pop right in there.\n\n527\n00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:12.935\nWell I want to I have to go in and\nI have to format this,\n\n528\n00:28:12.935 --> 00:28:14.175\nand I have to make it look good.\n\n529\n00:28:14.175 --> 00:28:19.265\nAnother thing you'll see is most\ndatabases don't contain calculated data.\n\n530\n00:28:19.265 --> 00:28:21.415\nAnything that I can calculate,\nthey don't do.\n\n531\n00:28:21.415 --> 00:28:23.287\nWe do it on the fly as we need it.\n\n532\n00:28:23.287 --> 00:28:25.257\nNeed it.\nSo I've got quantity and\n\n533\n00:28:25.257 --> 00:28:28.937\nI've got unit price, but I don't know\nhow much the total order was, right,\n\n534\n00:28:28.937 --> 00:28:31.157\nbecause in the database they\nall store that information.\n\n535\n00:28:31.157 --> 00:28:34.487\nWhile my spreadsheet that I turn in\nto my boss, I need that information.\n\n536\n00:28:34.487 --> 00:28:35.567\nSo I want to write a formula.\n\n537\n00:28:35.567 --> 00:28:39.897\nNow I'm going to show you later\non a much more complex macro,\n\n538\n00:28:39.897 --> 00:28:45.267\nwhere we do a lot of formatting, we add a\nlot of complex formulas like countifs and\n\n539\n00:28:45.267 --> 00:28:49.520\nsumifs and things like that, but we\nhaven't learn to write those formulas yet.\n\n540\n00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:50.970\nSo I'm gonna hold off on that and\n\n541\n00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:55.640\njust show you a simple macro right\nat a sum to this column, right?\n\n542\n00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:59.310\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nstart by recording the macro,\n\n543\n00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:01.990\nand here's the thing you gotta\nremember when you're doing macros.\n\n544\n00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:03.900\nIt records everything you do, so\n\n545\n00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:08.220\nevery scroll,\nevery click all of that it records.\n\n546\n00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:11.900\nSo good thing to do Is to run\nthrough it once in your head or\n\n547\n00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:16.160\nwith your data and\nkinda get the steps down pat.\n\n548\n00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:19.170\nRight?\nOtherwise when you run the macro,\n\n549\n00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:22.120\nyou'll see it flip between different\ntabs even though it didn't need to, or\n\n550\n00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:25.070\nscroll down then scroll back up and\nthings like that.\n\n551\n00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:27.660\nSo try to get your steps down pat.\n\n552\n00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:28.550\nFor this one, again,\n\n553\n00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:33.530\nI'm just gonna add a summary column here\nto start the recording of the macro.\n\n554\n00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:36.280\nThere's a little button down\non my status bar here that\n\n555\n00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:40.060\nsays no macro's are currently recording\nclick to begin recording a new macro.\n\n556\n00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:44.110\nI'm going to go ahead and click there and\nI'm going to give it a name.\n\n557\n00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:47.070\nI'm going to call this add sum.\n\n558\n00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:49.830\nWith names on the macro's you\ndon't want any spaces in them.\n\n559\n00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:52.330\nIf I put a space in there\nit will give me an error.\n\n560\n00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:55.590\nSo if you really need a space,\nput an underscore in there.\n\n561\n00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:59.030\nWe can also ad a short cut key.\n\n562\n00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:02.450\nNow I am going to do, lets do a control.\n\n563\n00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:04.660\nSomething that is not in\nuse by anything else.\n\n564\n00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:09.660\nI will do a control L, I think that is\nsafe there, and then where do I want\n\n565\n00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:13.490\nto store the Madcrew, this is another\noption we have to pay attention to.\n\n566\n00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:14.910\nThis work book.\n\n567\n00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:19.270\nPersonal Macro Workbook or New Workbook.\n\n568\n00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:22.330\nIf I store it in this workbook\nwhich is the default,\n\n569\n00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:25.820\nevery time I open this workbook\nup that macro will be available.\n\n570\n00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:29.850\nIf I open up a different workbook\nthat macro will not be available.\n\n571\n00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:33.170\nSo is this a macro that I'm only going\nto use in this particular workbook, or\n\n572\n00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:35.480\nis it one that I want to be\navailable no matter what workbook,\n\n573\n00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:39.780\neven new workbooks that I open If I want\nit to be available in other workbooks,\n\n574\n00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:42.240\nI choose the personal macro workbook.\n\n575\n00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:46.540\nIt's a special workbook that is hidden\nfrom us that access has, and it will put\n\n576\n00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:50.340\nall the macros in there and that way, any\nspread sheets you open, any work book you\n\n577\n00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:54.310\nopen, you'll have access to those macros\nso, I'll go ahead and store it there.\n\n578\n00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:58.005\nThat's fine, and,\n\n579\n00:30:58.005 --> 00:31:03.910\nI'll say add sum Column to data.\n\n580\n00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:04.680\nSomething like that.\n\n581\n00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:05.180\nWe'll click ok.\n\n582\n00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:07.620\nAlright, so\nnow it's in the process of recording.\n\n583\n00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:10.090\nWe're gonna scroll back out,\nwe look down here.\n\n584\n00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:12.110\nNotice the button has changed to a box.\n\n585\n00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:15.280\nWhich kind of indicates that's our\nusually our stop button right on most\n\n586\n00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.710\ntape recorders, or recording devices.\n\n587\n00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:20.250\nSo that's what I'm gonna\nclick when I'm done.\n\n588\n00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:23.190\nSo I'm gonna add the word Sum,\nor let's do Total.\n\n589\n00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:24.450\nNow, see right there?\n\n590\n00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:28.220\nIt will remember the fact that I made\nthose typos, and if you watch closely,\n\n591\n00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:29.620\nit'll actually do that.\n\n592\n00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:31.880\nKinda silly.\n\n593\n00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:37.110\nThen here, I'm gonna add a formula,\nequals, quantity\n\n594\n00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:42.910\ntimes unit price, and I'll show you how to\ndo these formulas in an episode coming up,\n\n595\n00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:45.460\nand I'll go ahead and\nhit enter, all right.\n\n596\n00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:46.290\nSo there's my total, and\n\n597\n00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:49.880\nthen I'm gonna go ahead and series fill\nall the way down to the end of that,\n\n598\n00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:53.660\nwhich I'll show you how to do in just\na little bit as well, and I'll stop there,\n\n599\n00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:56.570\ncuz we haven't heard a lot about\nthe formatting and things like that.\n\n600\n00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:59.409\nSo I'll click away to deselect, and\n\n601\n00:31:59.409 --> 00:32:03.446\nnow I'm going to go over here and\nstop my recording.\n\n602\n00:32:03.446 --> 00:32:05.489\nSo now I have a macro.\n\n603\n00:32:05.489 --> 00:32:10.414\nAnd the idea is that I can go to another\nspreadsheet, and I can just play that.\n\n604\n00:32:10.414 --> 00:32:11.120\nSo let's try it.\n\n605\n00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:16.078\nI'm gonna do my Ctrl+L, and\n\n606\n00:32:16.078 --> 00:32:19.330\nlook at there.\n\n607\n00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:23.760\nNow, somehow I put total way over there,\nwhich is interesting.\n\n608\n00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:28.250\nI'll have to double check and\nsee why, I wonder if my active cell.\n\n609\n00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:29.170\nWe'll move that up here.\n\n610\n00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.710\nBut you noticed that it put the word\ntotal in the wrong spot and\n\n611\n00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:37.170\nwe will figure out why it did that here\nin just a second, and then it created my\n\n612\n00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:41.660\nformula and it filled that formula in\nall the way down to the bottom, right?\n\n613\n00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:44.830\nAnd, that was just a very simple macro.\n\n614\n00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:48.470\nI could've spent, and what we're going to\ndo later on is I'm going to show you how\n\n615\n00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:53.530\nto do all this with a macro, and\nreally it's just starting the recording,\n\n616\n00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:56.120\ndoing the steps and\nthen stopping the recording.\n\n617\n00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:57.200\nThat's all there is to it.\n\n618\n00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.520\n>> Now Mike,\nwhen we end up saving this workbook,\n\n619\n00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:02.400\nis there anything that changes\nabout the workbook itself?\n\n620\n00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.790\n>> No.\nWell yes, actually very good point there.\n\n621\n00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:09.760\nThis particular one I didn't save\nthe macro in the workbook, so\n\n622\n00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:11.040\nit shouldn't bother me.\n\n623\n00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.430\nLet's see what happens here.\n\n624\n00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:14.590\nClick save and everything's fine.\n\n625\n00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:17.230\nBecause I stored that macro\nin that personal workbook,\n\n626\n00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:18.850\nwhich is separate from this one.\n\n627\n00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:21.580\nBut if you store a macro in a workbook.\n\n628\n00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:23.780\nLet's say I wanna send\nthis workbook to Ronny,\n\n629\n00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:25.930\nand I need that macro functionality.\n\n630\n00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:30.680\nWhen Ronny gets it, he needs to be able\nto use that macro for whatever reason.\n\n631\n00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.990\nWell, in that case I can't put it in my\npersonal workbook I got to store it in\n\n632\n00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:35.470\nthis workbook.\n\n633\n00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:40.990\nThe default file format for\nExcel is a .xlsx,\n\n634\n00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:44.530\nwhich does not contain macros,\nand it's a security feature.\n\n635\n00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:47.160\nThat way you can't have macros in there.\n\n636\n00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:51.700\nIf you want to save a workbook with\na macro in it, you have to change the file\n\n637\n00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:58.640\nextension to a .xls M if I can\nsay that m being for macro.\n\n638\n00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:00.680\nRight?\nAnd let's record another macro real quick.\n\n639\n00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.520\nAll I'm going to do is I'm\ngoing to just hit record and\n\n640\n00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:07.780\nI'll call it Macro2 that's fine or\nI'll call it HeaderRow.\n\n641\n00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:11.680\nAnd I put a space in there,\nso let's get rid of that.\n\n642\n00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:13.650\nAnd I'm going to store\nthis in this workbook.\n\n643\n00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:15.330\nAnd I'll click okay.\n\n644\n00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:20.040\nAnd then I'm gonna select row one and\nI'm gonna make it bold and\n\n645\n00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:21.910\nbump that font up one point.\n\n646\n00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:25.460\nAnd I'll leave it at that.\n\n647\n00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:26.740\nI'll click away from everything.\n\n648\n00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:30.020\nAnd I'll stop recording my macro.\n\n649\n00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:32.130\nNow watch what happens when I go to save.\n\n650\n00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:36.670\nIt's gonna say, the following features\ncannot be saved in a macro free workbook.\n\n651\n00:34:36.670 --> 00:34:39.920\nSo I'm gonna say, to continue\nsaving as a macro free workbook,\n\n652\n00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:42.880\nyes, I'm gonna say no.\n\n653\n00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:48.560\nAnd notice, I'm gonna change\nthis to a .xlsm right there.\n\n654\n00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.730\nMacro enabled workbook.\n\n655\n00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.222\nSee, it changes that extension.\n\n656\n00:34:53.222 --> 00:34:54.962\nTo a .xlsm.\n\n657\n00:34:54.962 --> 00:34:56.508\nAll right.\n\n658\n00:34:56.508 --> 00:35:03.230\nThen I can click save and that's okay.\n\n659\n00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:05.060\nWe'll click okay and there we go.\n\n660\n00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:09.440\nSo as Ronny asked,\nthe answer to his question is yes.\n\n661\n00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.070\nIf you wanna store macros in the workbook,\n\n662\n00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:15.880\nyou have to change the file format or\nthe extension on that file.\n\n663\n00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:19.600\nOtherwise, it'll save it and\nit'll leave the macros out.\n\n664\n00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:20.460\n>> All right, Mike.\n\n665\n00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:23.720\nWell, that's a lot to really help us to\nbecome more efficient as we think about\n\n666\n00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:24.690\na few things here.\n\n667\n00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:27.890\nIs there any other thing that we need\nto think about as far as getting\n\n668\n00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:28.510\nmore efficient?\n\n669\n00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:31.960\n>> There is one more thing I wanna throw\nin there was assigning shortcut keys.\n\n670\n00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.880\nYou saw that when I wrote that macro\nthat I could assign a shortcut\n\n671\n00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.139\nkey to the macro itself.\n\n672\n00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:40.350\nThe other shortcut keys we have to worry\nabout are for the commands up here.\n\n673\n00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:44.750\nAnd it's really not so much that we add\nthem, it's that Microsoft does it for me.\n\n674\n00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:47.420\nBut watch me, if I hit alt on my keyboard,\n\n675\n00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:52.250\nnotice up here at the top, all these\nlittle letters and numbers come out.\n\n676\n00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:56.580\nSo basically what's going on is when\nI hit the alt key on my keyboard,\n\n677\n00:35:56.580 --> 00:36:01.600\nit's saying if you wanna jump to\nthe formulas ribbon hit the letter M.\n\n678\n00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:05.740\nSo I hit M and now here's all\nthe commands on the formulas written and\n\n679\n00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:08.120\neach one has a letter associated with it.\n\n680\n00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:12.020\nSo if I want to show formulas,\nit's the letter H.\n\n681\n00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:13.770\nI hit H H.\n\n682\n00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:16.780\nAnd there we go, I'm now showing formulas.\n\n683\n00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:19.250\nSo the keyboard shortcuts already exist.\n\n684\n00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:21.400\nYou hit the alt key to pull them up.\n\n685\n00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:23.680\nWhen it talks about\nassigning shortcut keys,\n\n686\n00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:27.110\nyou're really looking at macros,\nand your custom ribbons.\n\n687\n00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:29.350\nLet's go take a look at my tab over here.\n\n688\n00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:34.847\nI'm gonna hit alt, And\nI'll hit Y2 for my custom tab.\n\n689\n00:36:34.847 --> 00:36:37.000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Y2, all right.\n\n690\n00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.190\nSo one, I didn't assign that, right?\n\n691\n00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:40.650\nWhen we created that custom ribbon,\n\n692\n00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:43.930\nI didn't say, Y2's gonna need\na keyboard shortcut for it.\n\n693\n00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:45.500\nBut it assigned one for me.\n\n694\n00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:50.840\nAnd then the commands that I added to my\nribbon, It also added keyboard circuits.\n\n695\n00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:55.700\nSo pate special, I don't have anything so\nthey're grayed out I don't have a table so\n\n696\n00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:56.770\nthose are grayed out.\n\n697\n00:36:56.770 --> 00:37:02.870\nBut you can see it added keyboard\nshortcuts to those commands for me, right?\n\n698\n00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:07.050\nSo even my custom ribbons that I create\nget assigned keyboard shortcuts.\n\n699\n00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:10.950\nAnd just again, some people are really\ngood, I love keyboard shortcuts.\n\n700\n00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:14.750\nYes the more time, you know, here's what\nthe, I remember when I first got into\n\n701\n00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:18.370\ncomputers they tried to tell me that,\nyou know, the mouse is inefficient.\n\n702\n00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:21.060\nLike I love my mouse,\nI can work really well with it.\n\n703\n00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:23.880\nBut what you'll find is that somebody that\ncan do keyboard shortcuts by the time that\n\n704\n00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:27.450\nit takes for you take your hand off\nthe mouse, put it on the keyboard,\n\n705\n00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:32.230\ntype whatever, and go back to your mouse,\nclick on the next thing,\n\n706\n00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:33.040\nget back to your keyboard.\n\n707\n00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:35.690\nSomebody that knows a keyboard\nshortcut would've been done by now.\n\n708\n00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:37.760\nSo they are pretty efficient.\n\n709\n00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:38.710\n>> All right.\n\n710\n00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:42.060\nWell Mike, that's a great place for\nus to go in this episode,\n\n711\n00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:45.500\nsince we did learn more about\nhow we can actually use Excel.\n\n712\n00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:48.200\nAnd make it a bit more efficient\nin the way that we work.\n\n713\n00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.080\nSo we're gonna go and sign off.\n\n714\n00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:52.490\nSigning off for ITPro TV, I'm Ronny Wong.\n\n715\n00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:53.690\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n716\n00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:59.001\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n717\n00:37:59.001 --> 00:38:02.850\n[SOUND]\n\n",

They guide us through some of the different options we have for saving an Excel file in a different format to make the data more accessible to people who may not use excel.  While printing is not difficult, setting up to print what we want to print has many more options that can make it a little more complex so Mike shows us some of the printing options available including setting a print area and setting print scaling as well as adding in information into the headers and footers.  They close out of the show by talking about the benefits of saving to remote locations.",

00:00:18.370\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today,\n\n4\n00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.910\nwe're gonna be taking a look\nat Microsoft Excel 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.070\nAnd we're heading into\nthe area of printing and\n\n6\n00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.030\nsaving, two of the big areas that\nwe really do need to understand.\n\n7\n00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.080\nBecause it is essential that we can\ntake the data that we're working,\n\n8\n00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.820\nwith make sure that we can save it so\nthat we don't lose the data, but\n\n9\n00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.170\nas well as being able to print it out.\n\n10\n00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.940\nAnd we are gonna see there are some\nchallenges especially when we're printing\n\n11\n00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.500\nout large work books, too.\n\n12\n00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.860\nAnd who better to help us than well Mr.\nExcel himself, Mike Rodrick.\n\n13\n00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.950\nMike, welcome back and\nwhere are we getting started here?\n\n14\n00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.790\n>> Well, let's start with printing, right?\n\n15\n00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.500\nAnd printing is something,\nwe're going paperless, so\n\n16\n00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.970\nwe really don't need to print for\nmuch longer.\n\n17\n00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:55.710\n>> Never.\n\n18\n00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.360\n>> I'm kidding, right?\n\n19\n00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.160\nWe've been saying that since,\nI don't know, a decade now.\n\n20\n00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.980\nBut, yes, there's many times that we do\nneed a hard copy, what I call a hard copy.\n\n21\n00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.930\nWe gotta get it off our screen and\n\n22\n00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.330\nonto a good old piece of paper that we can\nshare with somebody, send to somebody,\n\n23\n00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.790\nput on a clipboard somewhere, whatever\nthe case may be, you need that hard copy.\n\n24\n00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.830\nOr maybe the numbers change and\nyou need a snap shot.\n\n25\n00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:19.770\nYou need to print it or\n\n26\n00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.735\nwhat have you, several different\nreasons you might want to print it out.\n\n27\n00:01:22.735 --> 00:01:26.370\nSometimes I like to print them out just so\nI can scribble and make notes and\n\n28\n00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.846\nthink about it and then go back and\nthen do things inside or on Excel.\n\n29\n00:01:30.846 --> 00:01:33.856\nSo whatever the reason,\nwe need to be able to print.\n\n30\n00:01:33.856 --> 00:01:34.480\nAnd as Ronnie said,\n\n31\n00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.190\nprinting in Excel is not a straight\nforward as a text editor like Word.\n\n32\n00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.250\nBecause in Word we've got our page layout,\nright?\n\n33\n00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.450\nAnd we've got our margins, and\nwe type within those margins.\n\n34\n00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.460\nAnd it just puts a new page and\nour text roles down.\n\n35\n00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.325\nAnd we're typically good to go.\n\n36\n00:01:51.325 --> 00:01:54.410\nNow, of course, there are some fancy\nthings we can do with that, but\n\n37\n00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.950\nby default it's pretty easy\njust to print out a document.\n\n38\n00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.720\nWith Excel we don't really have that,\nright?\n\n39\n00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.690\nBecause we can many columns,\nmany, many, many columns, and\n\n40\n00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.688\nthey're not gonna fit on one page,\nat least legibly.\n\n41\n00:02:07.688 --> 00:02:10.720\nWe can have hundreds of thousands of rows,\nand\n\n42\n00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.720\nagain, not gonna be able to fit\nthat on one or two pages legibly.\n\n43\n00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.140\nAnd we might not want all of that.\n\n44\n00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.580\nSo we've got to figure out how to\ndecide what it is we want to print,\n\n45\n00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.690\nhow we're going to go about printing it,\nhow we want to make it fit on the page and\n\n46\n00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.190\nstill be legible.\n\n47\n00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.210\nSo there's a few things, and\nwe've seen a couple of them already.\n\n48\n00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.840\nWe've looked at orientation or\n\n49\n00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.870\nwe talked a little bit about it kind of\nwhen we were exploring the interface.\n\n50\n00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.140\nWe've looked at headers and footers a\nlittle bit, but we're gonna go back in and\n\n51\n00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.040\ntake another look at those.\n\n52\n00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.980\nSo the first thing I want to talk about\nspecifically is setting what they call\n\n53\n00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:43.610\na print area.\n\n54\n00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.500\nAnd this is a very common\nthing to do with Excel.\n\n55\n00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.220\nIf we take a look at this\nworkbook that I have open here,\n\n56\n00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.928\nI've got the January sales figures here.\n\n57\n00:02:52.928 --> 00:02:56.010\nAnd as I scroll down,\nyou can see I've got, I don't know,\n\n58\n00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.110\na few hundred rows here, 250,\nsomething like that, a pretty long list.\n\n59\n00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.770\nAnd then off to the side,\n\n60\n00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.740\nI've got like a summary information\nwhere I've got some totals going on.\n\n61\n00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.820\nAnd my boss, when they want these numbers,\nshe doesn't want the details.\n\n62\n00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.880\nAll she needs is the summary information,\nright?\n\n63\n00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.350\nWell, when I go to print this, then all\nI wanna do is print this over here.\n\n64\n00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.490\nI can do like Print Selections,\nwhich I'll show you how to do.\n\n65\n00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.800\nBut what we're gonna do is,\nset up what we call the Print Area.\n\n66\n00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.600\nThere's this option on\nthe Page Layout ribbon.\n\n67\n00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.790\nThere's a Print Area dropdown,\nand I can do Set Print Area.\n\n68\n00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.400\nWhen I do that, oops, and\nyes, let's cancel that.\n\n69\n00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.750\nYou want to before you do that, you want\nto select the print area, all right?\n\n70\n00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:44.570\nI forgot to do that.\n\n71\n00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.280\nSo I'm gonna just click and\ndrag across this area right here.\n\n72\n00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.770\nNow that I got that area highlighted,\nI'm gonna choose Set Print Area.\n\n73\n00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.450\nSo it's a little backwards from a lot of\nthe other things we're doing in Excel\n\n74\n00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.910\nwhere you first pick the command, and\nthen it gives you the picker dialogue box,\n\n75\n00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.500\nwhere you go Select Your Cells.\n\n76\n00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.550\nIn this one you want to select them\nfirst and then click the Set Print Area.\n\n77\n00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.930\nSo now notice it's called the Print Area.\n\n78\n00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.745\nYou can see over here in\nthe name box it says Print Area.\n\n79\n00:04:11.745 --> 00:04:12.575\nI click away from it.\n\n80\n00:04:12.575 --> 00:04:14.725\nIt really doesn't look any different.\n\n81\n00:04:14.725 --> 00:04:19.175\nYou might be able to see that faint\nline that's going around that area.\n\n82\n00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:23.085\nBut other than that the sheet\nstill works exactly the same.\n\n83\n00:04:23.085 --> 00:04:25.445\nThe difference is going\nto be when I go to print.\n\n84\n00:04:25.445 --> 00:04:27.665\nI go File, then Print.\n\n85\n00:04:27.665 --> 00:04:34.150\nAnd if you look at my print preview\nit's just those totals area, right?\n\n86\n00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.840\nThere's no columns,\nthere's no details or anything.\n\n87\n00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.140\nAnd I didn't have to select anything when\nI got in here like Print My Selection or\n\n88\n00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.020\nDefine the Range or anything like that.\n\n89\n00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.030\nBy setting that ahead of time,\nyou could actually add Print or\n\n90\n00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.540\nQuick Print up here in your quick\naccess toolbar and just click Print.\n\n91\n00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.450\nAnd it would just print that area.\n\n92\n00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.080\nNo matter what other data's on that sheet,\nit's just gonna print that area.\n\n93\n00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.220\nSo I find that really handy if I\nhave a sheet like this that has\n\n94\n00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.230\nthat summary type information.\n\n95\n00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.470\nTo get rid of that print area,\n\n96\n00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.680\nbecause now every time we go to Print\nit only wants to print that area.\n\n97\n00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.190\nIf I need to get rid of that, you go right\nback to Print Area and Clear Print Area.\n\n98\n00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:19.180\nNow that I've got a print area added or\ncreated, notice it has Add to Print Area.\n\n99\n00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.060\nSo maybe I had a totals row\ndown at the bottom down here.\n\n100\n00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.358\nI'm just gonna real quick pretend that\nthis is some kind of totals area.\n\n101\n00:05:29.358 --> 00:05:31.280\nSo we're just gonna do\na real quick auto sum.\n\n102\n00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.520\nDon't worry I'll show you some of\nthese information in the future.\n\n103\n00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:37.770\nThen, we'll drag that over there.\n\n104\n00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.342\nLet's say I wanted to add\nthat to my print area.\n\n105\n00:05:41.342 --> 00:05:47.170\nI could highlight these guys and\n\n106\n00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:53.550\nthen go to back to my Page Layout and\nthen Print Area, Add to Print Area.\n\n107\n00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.340\nSo now you see there's a faint little\nbox going around that as well.\n\n108\n00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:03.380\nWhen I go File and Print, I get two pages.\n\n109\n00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:08.320\nThe second page is going to be\nthat totals row that I just added.\n\n110\n00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.030\nSo you do your print page, what I was\ntrying to show you there is that the print\n\n111\n00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.830\nareas don't have to be contiguous.\n\n112\n00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.100\nThey don't have to be touching.\n\n113\n00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.720\nYou can have a section from over here,\na little section from over there.\n\n114\n00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.490\nYou define all those as your print area,\n\n115\n00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.390\nand then when you print it skips the other\nstuff and then just prints those.\n\n116\n00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.680\nAnd then of course to get rid of it,\nClear Print Area.\n\n117\n00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.300\nThey're all gone.\n\n118\n00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:33.050\nAnd that doesn't do, it clears all of\nthem, not just the last one you did.\n\n119\n00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.020\nThis is no longer a print area either.\n\n120\n00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:41.470\nWhen I go to File and Print, it's now back\nto printing the entire worksheet there.\n\n121\n00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:42.420\nSo pretty easy to do.\n\n122\n00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.740\nIf you've got a section that\nyou always need to print,\n\n123\n00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.620\njust define it as a print area.\n\n124\n00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.700\nOther things that we're gonna\nkind of jump around here, Ronnie.\n\n125\n00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:55.460\nThey got saving workbooks in alternate\nfile format, another thing that we really\n\n126\n00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:00.840\nneed to be able to do, especially in\nenvironments where we use a big fancy,\n\n127\n00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.950\nheterogeneous type of\nenvironment where people use\n\n128\n00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:07.810\ndifferent types of applications\nto work with this data.\n\n129\n00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:11.700\nIf not everybody is using Excel, I might\nneed to save this in a format that is\n\n130\n00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.110\ncompatible with somebody\nelse's applications,\n\n131\n00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:16.505\nwhatever they want to do it in.\n\n132\n00:07:16.505 --> 00:07:19.400\nAnd Excel gives us several\ndifferent options.\n\n133\n00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.090\nIf we go File and\n\n134\n00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:25.290\nI'm gonna do a Save As, because this\ndocument has already been saved once.\n\n135\n00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:29.600\nIf I just click Save,\nit's gonna use the already existing name,\n\n136\n00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.300\nthe already existing location, and\nthe already existing extension.\n\n137\n00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.140\nSo I won't be able to change any of that.\n\n138\n00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:38.940\nIf I want to save this as an alternate\nfile format to give to Ronnie to work with\n\n139\n00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:42.400\nhis program, I have to do a Save As.\n\n140\n00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.530\nAll right, and in here, I can go and find\nthe location that I want to save it to.\n\n141\n00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:51.850\nAnd then for the Save as type,\nI get a drop down list.\n\n142\n00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:53.960\nAnd you'll see it's not a short list.\n\n143\n00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.609\nI've got my default Excel\nworkbook there at the top.\n\n144\n00:07:56.609 --> 00:08:00.879\nAnd let me zoom in a wee bit so\nwe can get a better look at these guys.\n\n145\n00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:01.750\nRight?\n\n146\n00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:07.340\nSo I've got my Excel Workbook, I've got my\nMacro-Enabled Workbook, Binary Workbooks.\n\n147\n00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:12.700\nHere I can go back to a 97-2003 format,\nso if not everyone's been upgraded,\n\n148\n00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:17.750\nthey wouldn't understand that .xlsx\npossibly, I can save it as an .xls.\n\n149\n00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.740\nOr I might have some other\napplication that's not Office, but\n\n150\n00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:25.610\nit does, it was at the time compatible\nwith the old office formats.\n\n151\n00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:29.030\nSo I can go back to that older format,\nxml for\n\n152\n00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:33.900\nexample a very neutral language that\nalmost all applications understand.\n\n153\n00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.080\nWeb formats you can do templates.\n\n154\n00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.670\nWe haven't talk about those guys yet.\n\n155\n00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:43.983\nWe've got Tab delimited,\ncomma separated values.\n\n156\n00:08:43.983 --> 00:08:46.482\nRemember I showed you that one,\nin a previous episode?\n\n157\n00:08:46.482 --> 00:08:48.241\nVery common format to use,\n\n158\n00:08:48.241 --> 00:08:53.060\nwhen I need to move this data\nfrom one application to another.\n\n159\n00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:57.715\nI've got some old Macintosh text\nfiles csv files down there,\n\n160\n00:08:57.715 --> 00:09:01.305\nPDFs, xps, everybody's favorite, right?\n\n161\n00:09:01.305 --> 00:09:02.191\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n162\n00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:03.066\n>> I'm just kidding.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n163\n00:09:03.066 --> 00:09:04.482\n>> I'm kidding, Microsoft.\n\n164\n00:09:04.482 --> 00:09:05.380\nWe all love XPS.\n\n165\n00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.210\nOpenDocument Spreadsheet.\n\n166\n00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:10.150\nNotice that's actually a choice.\n\n167\n00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:13.969\nSo we were talking at the break with\nDavid out there in the chat room,\n\n168\n00:09:13.969 --> 00:09:16.192\ntalking about Google Docs and Sheets.\n\n169\n00:09:16.192 --> 00:09:21.107\nI can save this as a dot ods\nthat they could then open up.\n\n170\n00:09:21.107 --> 00:09:25.482\nNow I'm pretty sure, Google Docs can\nactually open up Excel files but anyway,\n\n171\n00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:29.659\nwhat if you wanted to put it in that\nformat because you had an application that\n\n172\n00:09:29.659 --> 00:09:33.440\nunderstood dot ods, but\ndidn't understand dot xlxs, right?\n\n173\n00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:33.970\nWell, you can do that,\n\n174\n00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:38.790\nit's as simple as just doing a file save\nand then choosing the format you want.\n\n175\n00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:42.300\nSo if somebody comes to you and says, hey,\nI need that data that you've got in that\n\n176\n00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:47.390\nExcel Spreadsheet, but my application only\ndoes PDFs, or only does comma separated\n\n177\n00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:51.890\nvalues, or doesn't understand that\nExcel format, could you give it to me?\n\n178\n00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:54.940\nYou don't have to try to copy and\npaste it into something else,\n\n179\n00:09:54.940 --> 00:10:01.390\nyou can just do a File > Save As, and\npick from this extensive list of formats.\n\n180\n00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:02.800\nSo Excel makes it pretty darn easy.\n\n181\n00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:08.560\nAll right, so\nwe can save it as whatever format we need.\n\n182\n00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:11.670\nAgain, that's really for\nbackwards compatibility or\n\n183\n00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:16.850\nto give that data to somebody\nthat's using another application.\n\n184\n00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:20.016\n>> Yeah, I think that usually the times\nthat I really need it is because\n\n185\n00:10:20.016 --> 00:10:22.530\nsomebody is not running\nthe latest version of Excel.\n\n186\n00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:26.393\nSo even if I were to transfer\nthat workbook over to them,\n\n187\n00:10:26.393 --> 00:10:31.260\nif they're running let's say\nExcel 2007 and not up to 2016.\n\n188\n00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.405\nWell, you may find out that they\ncan't actually open that format,\n\n189\n00:10:34.405 --> 00:10:38.280\neven though you can perfectly open their\nformat, they may not be able to open that.\n\n190\n00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:42.200\nSo giving you the ability to save it\nwith backward compatibility also helps.\n\n191\n00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.864\nThe other thing that also helps\nis what Mike was mentioning,\n\n192\n00:10:44.864 --> 00:10:48.010\nthe very fact is not everybody's\ngonna have the same applications,.\n\n193\n00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:52.737\nSo you may actually again want to save it\nin some format that they believe that they\n\n194\n00:10:52.737 --> 00:10:54.180\ncan open up too.\n\n195\n00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:58.319\nYou will end up finding out sometimes\nthough when you do these other formats,\n\n196\n00:10:58.319 --> 00:11:01.899\nit may not look exactly like it\nlooked inside of Excel on your page.\n\n197\n00:11:01.899 --> 00:11:04.368\nAnd there's a couple of reasons for\nthat, but\n\n198\n00:11:04.368 --> 00:11:07.482\njust kinda realize that they\nmay not see exactly that way.\n\n199\n00:11:07.482 --> 00:11:10.660\nSo you may see some format changing\ngoing on, but overall though,\n\n200\n00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:13.190\nthey'll at least get all\nthe data that they need.\n\n201\n00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:14.030\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n202\n00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:15.490\nThat's a great point, Ronnie.\n\n203\n00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:18.450\nThe other thing you might\nlose is some functionality.\n\n204\n00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:20.520\nIf you've got formulas in here and\n\n205\n00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:24.120\nyou're saving it as a dot CSV file,\nwell, that's just a text file.\n\n206\n00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.980\nIt's not gonna understand those formulas,\nso it's gonna warn you.\n\n207\n00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:28.154\nIt's gonna say, hey,\n\n208\n00:11:28.154 --> 00:11:31.816\nyou might lose some functionality if\nyou choose to save it in this format.\n\n209\n00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:33.149\nDo you wanna continue?\n\n210\n00:11:33.149 --> 00:11:34.090\nYou say, yes.\n\n211\n00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:36.530\nAnd it just strips out anything\nthat wouldn't be compatible.\n\n212\n00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:40.954\nCharts and graphs, Excel has some\namazing charting capabilities, but\n\n213\n00:11:40.954 --> 00:11:45.738\nthose charts might not work in a Google\nDoc or a TXT file or something like that,\n\n214\n00:11:45.738 --> 00:11:48.441\nso again, you’re gonna lose some of that.\n\n215\n00:11:48.441 --> 00:11:52.441\nSometimes the way to go to\nthose alternate formats.\n\n216\n00:11:52.441 --> 00:11:54.290\nAll right, what else we got Ronnie?\n\n217\n00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:57.320\nPrinting back to printing.\n\n218\n00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.620\nPrinting individual worksheets\nis really the default.\n\n219\n00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:06.734\nWhen we go to File and Print,\nthis gives me 13 pages there.\n\n220\n00:12:06.734 --> 00:12:10.920\nThis is all one particular spreadsheet.\n\n221\n00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.790\nAll right, it's not the entire workbook.\n\n222\n00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:14.330\nNotice the default over here on the left.\n\n223\n00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:16.730\nLet me zoom in for you.\n\n224\n00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:18.790\nPrint active sheet, so in other words,\n\n225\n00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:23.230\nwhatever sheet I was looking at when I\nwent to the back stage and clicked print.\n\n226\n00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:24.900\nThat's the one it wants to print.\n\n227\n00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:26.490\nWe're not stuck with that,\nwe can change that.\n\n228\n00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:28.460\nI can hit this drop down list, and\n\n229\n00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:32.580\nwe'll see that I have the choice\nto Print Entire Workbook.\n\n230\n00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:36.950\nSo I can print all five or six of those\ntabs that I have in that worksheet.\n\n231\n00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:41.460\nI don't have to go to one tab,\nprint, go to the next tab, print,\n\n232\n00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.760\nI can just print them all right here or\nI can Print Selection.\n\n233\n00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.066\nRemember, I said you\ncould set the print area,\n\n234\n00:12:47.066 --> 00:12:49.150\nsometimes if it's not a permanent thing.\n\n235\n00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:53.016\nAnd let me zoom back out here,\nwhat if I want to,\n\n236\n00:12:53.016 --> 00:12:56.230\nnormally I wanna print Just this area.\n\n237\n00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:57.774\nI might print it.\n\n238\n00:12:57.774 --> 00:13:00.480\nI might do it as a set print area.\n\n239\n00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.270\nBut today,\nI just wanna print this right here.\n\n240\n00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:05.610\nI don't normally do that.\n\n241\n00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:08.295\nWell, I'm not gonna set the print area,\ncuz that makes it the default,\n\n242\n00:13:08.295 --> 00:13:10.500\nthe only print that when I go to print.\n\n243\n00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:16.560\nWhat I can do, is I can select it and\nthen go File and Print and\n\n244\n00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:22.240\nthen change this to Print Selection and\nit prints only what I have selected.\n\n245\n00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:26.200\nSo if it's not something you do all\nthe time, rather than set the print area\n\n246\n00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:31.520\njust highlight that section and then go to\nPrint and choose to Print Selection Only.\n\n247\n00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.860\nSo easy to flip back and\nforth between printing one worksheet\n\n248\n00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:39.130\nthe entire workbook, or\njust a selection on your worksheet.\n\n249\n00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:43.710\nOther thing we have to\ndeal with is scaling.\n\n250\n00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:47.700\nAnd scaling becomes really important in\nExcel cuz of what I was saying earlier,\n\n251\n00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:52.650\nhow we're not, whereas in like Word,\nyou're kind of already limited, right?\n\n252\n00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:55.780\nYou've got a limited typing area,\nand you have to stay in there.\n\n253\n00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:59.200\nAnd, it auto-rolls to the next line,\nit auto-jumps to the next page.\n\n254\n00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.520\nWith Excel, I can keep adding\ncolumns until the cows come home.\n\n255\n00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:06.442\nI've got 16 million rows,\nI'm not constrained.\n\n256\n00:14:06.442 --> 00:14:09.850\nBut when I go to print it,\nnow I've got some issues, right?\n\n257\n00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:12.040\nSo we have to be able to deal with that.\n\n258\n00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:15.970\nAnd if you look at this one that I have\nhere, let's see if I can zoom in and\n\n259\n00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:18.550\nstill move around.\n\n260\n00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:24.904\nAs I scroll through here, it's gonna be\nreally hard to see, but the first few\n\n261\n00:14:24.904 --> 00:14:29.732\npages, let me just go back to the first\npage, and zoom into the top, right?\n\n262\n00:14:29.732 --> 00:14:34.650\nCompany, Order Date,\nProduct, and Quantity.\n\n263\n00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:38.546\nWell, I go through these first few pages,\nand I can see it's just repeating,\n\n264\n00:14:38.546 --> 00:14:42.570\nit's going down through all of\n250 something rows that I have.\n\n265\n00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:47.064\nAnd then it goes to page seven, and\nthere's the rest of my columns, right?\n\n266\n00:14:47.064 --> 00:14:51.648\nUnit/Price, Total, and\nthen that summary information over there.\n\n267\n00:14:51.648 --> 00:14:56.024\nBecause I had so many columns that\nit doesn't fit in that page, right?\n\n268\n00:14:56.024 --> 00:14:58.890\nWell, a couple of options\nthat I can do to fix that.\n\n269\n00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:01.240\nOne would be just to\nchange the orientation.\n\n270\n00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:05.450\nI can change this to Landscape, and\nnow I've got a little more space.\n\n271\n00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:10.138\nBut if we jump back over to page one,\nall right, we'll see I do get Company,\n\n272\n00:15:10.138 --> 00:15:13.899\nOrder/Date, Product,\nQuantity, Enterprise, Total.\n\n273\n00:15:13.899 --> 00:15:17.956\nThey all seem to fit except for\nthat summary area,\n\n274\n00:15:17.956 --> 00:15:22.316\nwhich ends up getting bumped over there,\nall right?\n\n275\n00:15:22.316 --> 00:15:24.980\nSo that's where the scaling\ncomes into play.\n\n276\n00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:29.000\nThis is probably not the best example\ncuz it's not gonna be real legible.\n\n277\n00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.410\nAlthough, it might be a good example,\ncuz this is typically what happens.\n\n278\n00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:35.840\nIf you try to squeeze\ntoo much data on a page,\n\n279\n00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.130\nlike we can go fit sheets on one page.\n\n280\n00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:43.760\nWell, obviously, that's not gonna work,\nbut look, my report is down to two pages.\n\n281\n00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:47.570\nI could do Fit-All Columns on One Page.\n\n282\n00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:51.589\nThis might make a little more\nsense now it is smaller, but\n\n283\n00:15:51.589 --> 00:15:56.467\nall the columns are on the page\nincluding that summary information.\n\n284\n00:15:56.467 --> 00:15:57.244\nAll right?\n\n285\n00:15:57.244 --> 00:16:00.578\nSo I find this really useful when\nI've got something, in fact,\n\n286\n00:16:00.578 --> 00:16:03.860\nlet's jump to a different sheet here,\nRonnie.\n\n287\n00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:08.167\nLet's go to February, and\nwith February, it goes, and\n\n288\n00:16:08.167 --> 00:16:12.670\nwe'll make some of these columns\njust a wee bit wider here,\n\n289\n00:16:16.115 --> 00:16:19.600\nwe'll go to print this, this will be a\nbetter example, a little more real world.\n\n290\n00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:24.320\nAs we go into print, all right,\nand right now setting up portrait.\n\n291\n00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.860\nSo I can see I'm not getting\nall my columns on there, but\n\n292\n00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:32.640\nit's not that many pages long,\nit's only 12 pages long.\n\n293\n00:16:33.965 --> 00:16:35.230\nSee if I can figure out, there you go.\n\n294\n00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:39.550\nIt's six pages long but then the seventh\npage is the last two columns for\n\n295\n00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:41.410\nall six of those pages, right?\n\n296\n00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:42.388\nSo I get 12 pages.\n\n297\n00:16:42.388 --> 00:16:46.610\nIf I could squeeze those last\ntwo columns on to one page,\n\n298\n00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:48.870\nI could cut the number of\npages I'm printing in half.\n\n299\n00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:51.000\nSo let's see if we can do that.\n\n300\n00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:57.020\nIf I flip this to a landscape,\nthat would probably fix my problem, but\n\n301\n00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:02.090\nnow I'm doing eight pages because I\ndon't have as much depth in that page.\n\n302\n00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:04.342\nSo maybe that's something\nI don't want to do.\n\n303\n00:17:04.342 --> 00:17:08.800\nI wanna leave it in portrait, but I need\nto get all those columns on the page.\n\n304\n00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.110\nThat's where the scaling comes into play.\n\n305\n00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:15.845\nI can come over here and say,\nfit all columns on one page.\n\n306\n00:17:15.845 --> 00:17:20.440\nAnd you see how it shrunk it down and now\nI can see all that data on a single page.\n\n307\n00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:25.310\nAll right, so now I'm down to five pages,\nI'm saving a tree out there I'm being\n\n308\n00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:29.630\ngreen, it's still legible,\neverything's on one page.\n\n309\n00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:33.440\nI don't have a bunch of pages that\nprinted just the last column.\n\n310\n00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.750\nYou know the scaling really\nis an effective tool to use,\n\n311\n00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:38.525\nas long as you don't go\ntoo small on the scaling.\n\n312\n00:17:38.525 --> 00:17:40.900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And there's a balance there, right?\n\n313\n00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:45.270\nThe human eye can adjust and\nit will accept a little bit of change, but\n\n314\n00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:47.840\nif all of a sudden you're used to seeing,\nlet's say, a 12 or\n\n315\n00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.985\n14 point font, and then it changes to\nless than eight, people will complain.\n\n316\n00:17:51.985 --> 00:17:52.510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n317\n00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:56.690\nas scaling makes the page looks better,\neverything does look smaller.\n\n318\n00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:59.060\nAnd as long as you kinda\nhave a balance to go look,\n\n319\n00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:02.540\nI can read it without having to squint,\nI think you're pretty much fine.\n\n320\n00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:05.799\nBut once you start having to do that,\nscalings no longer help,\n\n321\n00:18:05.799 --> 00:18:08.820\nandt that's where you do have to adjust\nwith other things that we mentioned.\n\n322\n00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:12.230\nthe landscape, or\nmaybe adjusting the columns manually,\n\n323\n00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:15.260\nand even your margins,\ngetting all that to fit in, and\n\n324\n00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:17.550\nthen maybe scaling would actually\nwork a little bit better for\n\n325\n00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:21.740\nyou, make it much more legible, but you\ncan't always count on it for legibility.\n\n326\n00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:22.650\n>> You really can't.\n\n327\n00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:25.260\nIt's one of those things that you just\ngotta get in there and play with.\n\n328\n00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.570\nAnd I was using all\nthe automatic settings.\n\n329\n00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:30.130\nI will show you there are some\nother settings in here.\n\n330\n00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:33.600\nWhen I go to my scaling,\nthere's fit all rows on one page.\n\n331\n00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:39.480\nSo again, if I had printed a spreadsheet\nin landscape, but even then five\n\n332\n00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:43.480\nof the rows fell of onto another page,\nI might say fit them all on to one page.\n\n333\n00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.960\nIt will shrink it up just a little bit,\nstill be legible but\n\n334\n00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.860\nit all still fits on one page.\n\n335\n00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:54.820\nOr you can do custom scaling options,\nand here I can see where it says fit to\n\n336\n00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:58.670\none page as wide by, and\nthey could put however many pages tall.\n\n337\n00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:02.190\nOr just two, and\nthen a specific percentage.\n\n338\n00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:07.200\nSo you might find that the automatic\noption's okay, but you could fine-tune\n\n339\n00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:11.330\nit a little bit, still get it on one page,\nand make it a little more readable.\n\n340\n00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:13.410\nSo come in there and\nplay with those options.\n\n341\n00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:17.520\nAll I did was go to the bottom of\nthis list, the scaling options,\n\n342\n00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:23.160\nwhich is by default no scaling, and pick\ncustom scaling options down at the bottom.\n\n343\n00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.540\nSo a few different ways you can try to\n\n344\n00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:28.020\nget that information to\nlook right when you print.\n\n345\n00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:31.740\nAnd nothing worse than going to\nthe printer and finding that\n\n346\n00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:36.290\none column has printed on a second page\nfor every page you've printed, you know?\n\n347\n00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:39.700\nSo you've doubled the number of pages when\nit could've just shrunk that column up\n\n348\n00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.730\na little bit and got it over on that page.\n\n349\n00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:44.430\nI remember you can also play with your\nmargins, we've shown you that, you can\n\n350\n00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:47.700\nplay with the margins, gives you a little\nmore print area on the page as well.\n\n351\n00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:52.780\nAll right, next thing we wanna talk about,\nRonnie, is repeating headers and footers.\n\n352\n00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:54.950\nNow we've done a little it of\nwork with headers and footers.\n\n353\n00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:57.680\nRemember, headers appear\nat the top of the page,\n\n354\n00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.750\nfooters appear at the bottom of the page.\n\n355\n00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:02.040\nThis is normally repeating information.\n\n356\n00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:06.440\nIt's gonna repeat on all the pages that\nwe have or all the pages that we print.\n\n357\n00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.260\nRemember it was divided up into\nthree sections, left, center,\n\n358\n00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:13.200\nand right for both the header, left,\ncenter, and right for the footer.\n\n359\n00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.090\nIf you want the same information on\nevery page, you're good to go, right?\n\n360\n00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:20.860\nYou can just go to that insert text,\nin fact let's do it, insert,\n\n361\n00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:23.950\ntext, header, and footer, right.\n\n362\n00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:27.900\nAnd there I can go in and, you know what\nI forgot I checked these guys earlier.\n\n363\n00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:32.130\nLet's undo that,\nwe'll get it back to the defaults.\n\n364\n00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:36.070\nThat's the way it looks by default and\nI can come in here and I can type that.\n\n365\n00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:40.530\nI can switch over the footer and I could\nadd my information in there as well.\n\n366\n00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:44.010\nBut there are some other options\nthat we might want to configure.\n\n367\n00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:47.530\nLet me click out of that and\nscroll back up.\n\n368\n00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:49.970\nWith our headers and footers,\nsometimes we want to print,\n\n369\n00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:51.980\nwhat if we want to print a title page,\nright?\n\n370\n00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.990\nIf you want a title page,\nin your footer you might put page number.\n\n371\n00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:58.500\nAnd let's just do it, I'll talk about it,\nwe'll do it at the same time.\n\n372\n00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:05.890\nLet's go to click on that so\nI get my contextual ribbon back.\n\n373\n00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:10.375\nWe'll go to go to footer and let's say\nI wanna put the page number in there.\n\n374\n00:21:10.375 --> 00:21:12.490\nI'll use their built in pager number.\n\n375\n00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:17.050\nWell that's gonna appear\non every single page.\n\n376\n00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:22.640\nIf I scroll over, look at page one,\nthere's page one.\n\n377\n00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.740\nWhat if this was a title page right?\n\n378\n00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:27.330\nWhat if I had a cover sheet\nthat I was working with?\n\n379\n00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:32.175\nOr some chart there that started out and\nI didn't want that to have a page number.\n\n380\n00:21:32.175 --> 00:21:40.470\nWell, on the options for my header and\nfooter I've got different first page.\n\n381\n00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:43.250\nNow, with different first page,\nit doesn't remove the header and\n\n382\n00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:45.720\nfooter from the first page.\n\n383\n00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.880\nWhat it does it it changes it.\n\n384\n00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:51.790\nSo now, if I scroll down, or\nin fact, let's do it the right way.\n\n385\n00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:52.890\nI don't have a big scroller.\n\n386\n00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:54.240\nWe'll say go to footer.\n\n387\n00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:59.840\nYou see first page footer, right, that's\ndifferent from the rest of the footers.\n\n388\n00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:03.170\nOver here, I have footer here,\n\n389\n00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:07.000\nI have my first page footer, so\nlet's add something to here.\n\n390\n00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:14.220\nWe'll just put M Roderick\non that first page.\n\n391\n00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:16.560\nSo I'll put my name on the first page, and\n\n392\n00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:20.630\nthen on the second page is where\nit starts with number two.\n\n393\n00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:25.120\nNow see notice the numbers still start\nthere, it just doesn't put that header or\n\n394\n00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.790\nthat footer excuse me, on that first page.\n\n395\n00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:29.050\nOther things you can do\nwith the headers and\n\n396\n00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:30.870\nfooters besides a different first page.\n\n397\n00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:33.580\nYou can have different odd and even pages.\n\n398\n00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:36.151\nAgain these are things that,\nI don't know, I don't find myself\n\n399\n00:22:36.151 --> 00:22:36.812\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n400\n00:22:36.812 --> 00:22:38.135\n>> Doing a lot with Excel.\n\n401\n00:22:38.135 --> 00:22:42.165\nIt's more of a Word document thing but\nmaybe my example here would be, what if\n\n402\n00:22:42.165 --> 00:22:46.170\nyou were printing out a bunch of sheets\nand you you were doing it two-sided.\n\n403\n00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:49.060\nAnd you wanted to make more\nlike a pamphlet out of it or\n\n404\n00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:50.670\na booklet out of it, right.\n\n405\n00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:56.500\nWell, your page number on your left side,\non your even number pages,\n\n406\n00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:59.320\nyou want the page number to be out\nthere on the left bottom corner.\n\n407\n00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.880\nBecause that's away from\nthe gutter in your book, right.\n\n408\n00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.135\nThe seam where the book folds.\n\n409\n00:23:04.135 --> 00:23:08.186\nOn your odd number pages on the right hand\nside, you want that page number to be on\n\n410\n00:23:08.186 --> 00:23:10.967\nthe right side, right,\non that right bottom corner,\n\n411\n00:23:10.967 --> 00:23:14.921\nagain away from the gutter ,away from\nthe seam where it’s hard to read that.\n\n412\n00:23:14.921 --> 00:23:19.254\nWell you can do different add and\neven pages and then what's gonna happen\n\n413\n00:23:19.254 --> 00:23:23.743\nis when you work with your headers and\nfooters, this my first page header.\n\n414\n00:23:23.743 --> 00:23:28.340\nAs I scrolled a little bit\n,there's my first page footer.\n\n415\n00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:31.960\nHere this header, well let's do footers\nI've been talking about footers.\n\n416\n00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:37.890\nWe go down here,\nthis is my even page footer.\n\n417\n00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:41.080\nSo even's gonna be on the left hand side.\n\n418\n00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:44.559\nSo I want my page number to be over there,\noops, did that twice.\n\n419\n00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:52.873\nAnd on my odd page footer, that's\nanother even, let's find an odd page.\n\n420\n00:23:55.854 --> 00:23:59.790\nAll right, I'm gonna take\nthat number out of there, And\n\n421\n00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:02.509\nput it over here on the right hand side.\n\n422\n00:24:02.509 --> 00:24:03.940\nI'll put page number.\n\n423\n00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:05.290\nAll right?\n\n424\n00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:08.650\nSo I'm just defining the headers and\nfooters, and\n\n425\n00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:10.160\nlet me jump back out to\nmy normal view here.\n\n426\n00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.695\nFor the different pages, and\n\n427\n00:24:13.695 --> 00:24:19.643\nnow when I go to print preview,\nhere's page one.\n\n428\n00:24:19.643 --> 00:24:20.710\nNotice it's got my name down there.\n\n429\n00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:22.380\nIt doesn't have a page number at all,\n\n430\n00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:25.660\nbecause I chose different\nfirst page header and footer.\n\n431\n00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:28.260\nGet to page two, that's an even number.\n\n432\n00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:31.270\nNotice that the page number\nis on the left-hand side.\n\n433\n00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:37.013\nYou get to page three, and the page\nnumber's over here on the right-hand side.\n\n434\n00:24:37.013 --> 00:24:40.388\nSo that's the idea, is if you want\nto differentiate the first page from\n\n435\n00:24:40.388 --> 00:24:44.330\neverything else, you get that different\nfirst page header check marked.\n\n436\n00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:48.540\nIf you want to differentiate between even\nand odd pages, you can do that as well,\n\n437\n00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:50.110\nyou simply put a check mark in there.\n\n438\n00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:51.700\nThen you've gotta make sure you define it,\n\n439\n00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.830\nyou've gotta define what do\nI want on the even pages.\n\n440\n00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:56.550\nWhat I want on the odd pages, and\n\n441\n00:24:56.550 --> 00:25:00.810\nthat's the part that can get a little\nbit confusing when you're working.\n\n442\n00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:04.530\nI don't know about you Ronnie,\nI get a little lost sometimes.\n\n443\n00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:05.630\nLet me go back over there.\n\n444\n00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:08.760\nInsert, text, header and footer,\n\n445\n00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:12.450\nand when you're looking at this, it's like\nwhere do I go to do the, because it will\n\n446\n00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:17.550\ngive you a quick link to the odd page\nfooters, or to the even page footers.\n\n447\n00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:22.070\nYou really have to look at\ntheir description, right?\n\n448\n00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:24.350\nThis will tell you this is the odd page.\n\n449\n00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:26.050\nThis will tell you that's the odd page.\n\n450\n00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:29.140\nSo I go a little further.\n\n451\n00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:31.720\nThere's my even page footer,\n\n452\n00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:35.270\nand it really doesn't matter\nwhich page you didn't find it on.\n\n453\n00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:38.850\nIn other words, there's a lot of even\npages, right, two, four, six, eight, ten.\n\n454\n00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:41.760\nI could go to page 20 and\ndefine the even page footer.\n\n455\n00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:44.720\nI could go to page 17 and\ndefine the odd page footer.\n\n456\n00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:47.680\nSo you don't have to find\nthe very first odd page or\n\n457\n00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.960\nthe very first even page as long as you\npay attention to which one you're on.\n\n458\n00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:55.680\n>> These headers and footers really do\nmatter, but like what Mike was saying,\n\n459\n00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.940\nnormally you see them more in\nprinted documents rather than\n\n460\n00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:02.540\nthings like Excel spread sheets that\nwe might have inside of a report, but\n\n461\n00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:05.150\nthat's pretty much the place\nwere you'll end up seeing them.\n\n462\n00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:07.820\nAnd normally, where I've actually seen\nsomething like what Mike was actually\n\n463\n00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:09.150\ndemonstrating to us,\n\n464\n00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:13.210\nis that there was a county just\nsouth of us down in Marin County.\n\n465\n00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:17.040\nThat they have multiple departments\nthat essentially bring together\n\n466\n00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:20.900\nmultiple workbooks together, and they're\ngonna print it out in a booklet for\n\n467\n00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:23.460\nwhoever's doing the auditing,\nand they have to be\n\n468\n00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:28.090\nactually ordered in a particular number\nand page, in the way that they need it.\n\n469\n00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:30.780\nSo, when I went down there, and\nthey were asking me about this,\n\n470\n00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:33.520\nI was like, yes,\nof course you can take that department and\n\n471\n00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:37.180\nyou can actually put an even number on\nthis side and an odd number, and make sure\n\n472\n00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:39.900\nit actually appears in the folded\nbooklet the way that they want it to.\n\n473\n00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:43.580\nAnd it was really surprising for them\nbecause they had all just decided let's\n\n474\n00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:46.220\njust center everything cuz\nthat makes it easier, but\n\n475\n00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:49.940\nthen they didn't know how, how do I start\nit on page number 72 if I need it to?\n\n476\n00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:53.600\nSo there's more things that you can do\nwith this, but you can see it really is.\n\n477\n00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.740\nIt's to help you in the context\nthat you're in and what you need,\n\n478\n00:26:56.740 --> 00:27:01.180\nso it can be beneficial, but\nmore likely, more than likely,\n\n479\n00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:04.860\nright, if you see this, it is because of\nyour prime merging reports together and\n\n480\n00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:09.740\nyou need that kind of nice, consistent\nformatting across those documents.\n\n481\n00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:10.850\n>> Absolutely.\n\n482\n00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:15.100\nAll right, last thing here we wanna\ntalk about is saving files and\n\n483\n00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:17.770\nsaving files specifically\nto remote location.\n\n484\n00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:21.700\nSo I'm going to show you a couple\nof different save options.\n\n485\n00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:25.080\nI'm going to go to my back stage\narea file, and remember what I said.\n\n486\n00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.910\nIf I click save,\nwell this document is not a new document.\n\n487\n00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:31.580\nIt already has a name,\nit already has a location, an extension.\n\n488\n00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:34.660\nSo if I click save,\nI don't really see anything, right,\n\n489\n00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:36.310\nbecause it's already been saved once.\n\n490\n00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:39.250\nIt just uses the same settings.\n\n491\n00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:44.310\nIf I do a save as or if this was a brand\nnew document that hadn't been saved yet,\n\n492\n00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:47.910\nthat's when I'm gonna get\nmy additional options.\n\n493\n00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:51.020\nSo let's say I want, I've been working\nwith this document here in class.\n\n494\n00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:53.510\nIt's saved on my local computer, but\n\n495\n00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:56.280\nI wanna be able to work with\nthis from my PC at home tonight.\n\n496\n00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.540\nSo what can I do?\n\n497\n00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.640\nWell I can save it out there to the cloud,\nright.\n\n498\n00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:00.650\nThe new big buzz word.\n\n499\n00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:02.360\nPut it out in the cloud.\n\n500\n00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:06.400\nOneDrive from Microsoft or\nother products from other companies,\n\n501\n00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:11.720\nmaybe your ISP might provide you\nwith some storage like that.\n\n502\n00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:16.520\nExcel, being a Microsoft product,\nties in directly with OneDrive, so\n\n503\n00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:18.420\nit makes it extremely easy.\n\n504\n00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:20.410\nThey do have to be logged in.\n\n505\n00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:25.170\nDown here at bottom of this list\nI've got my account option.\n\n506\n00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:25.780\nRight.\n\n507\n00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:29.881\nI click on account, and it's going to show\nme, hopefully nothing too personal here.\n\n508\n00:28:29.881 --> 00:28:33.640\n[LAUGH] I had to use my personal\naccount to get logged in here.\n\n509\n00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.320\nIt's got my email address up there.\n\n510\n00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.120\nYou can see who I'm logged in as.\n\n511\n00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:43.290\nRemember, these settings travel across\nall my different Office products.\n\n512\n00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:48.250\nThis is tied into Office 365, so\nthings like my background and my color and\n\n513\n00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:52.920\nstuff like that, but notice down here,\nConnected service, one drive personal.\n\n514\n00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:56.810\nSo I have tied this in\nto my OneDrive account.\n\n515\n00:28:56.810 --> 00:29:01.704\nYou can always go to add service and\nyou can add storage, Office 365,\n\n516\n00:29:01.704 --> 00:29:06.510\nOnePoint, you can do sharing with\nLinkedIn and Twitter, Flickr,\n\n517\n00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:11.810\nYouTube, bunch of neat options we\ncould do now in this day and age.\n\n518\n00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:13.860\nI'm gonna go back over\nto the save as here.\n\n519\n00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:16.850\nNow that I know that I'm logged in, and\nI can see my account right up here.\n\n520\n00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:18.840\nI can verify that I'm signed in.\n\n521\n00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:24.410\nRight, I can change accounts if I needed\ntoo, and then I can choose OneDrive and\n\n522\n00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:30.013\nI can come up here and I'll put it on\nMike Roderick's good old OneDrive folder,\n\n523\n00:29:30.013 --> 00:29:33.404\nand I'll click save.\n\n524\n00:29:33.404 --> 00:29:36.190\nIt takes a little bit longer\nthan saving it locally, right?\n\n525\n00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:39.890\nIt's reaching out there to those\nservers that Microsoft hosts and\n\n526\n00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:41.250\nit's now out there in the cloud.\n\n527\n00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:45.490\nSo I can go home to my machine, or I can\ntake my laptop that I travel with while\n\n528\n00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:48.680\nI'm working on the road or\nstaying at that hotel, and\n\n529\n00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:52.140\nI can work with that document, and when I\nsave it, I put it back up in the cloud.\n\n530\n00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.160\nI get back to work.\n\n531\n00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:58.700\nI log-in into my desktop back at work and\nI can access that same document with\n\n532\n00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:03.210\nall those changes, so it's a lot different\nthan working with that local copy.\n\n533\n00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:06.062\nYou're working with one copy that\nyou can access from anywhere.\n\n534\n00:30:06.062 --> 00:30:09.580\nSo Microsoft makes it very easy for\nus to access that cloud storage and\n\n535\n00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:11.370\nsave those files up there.\n\n536\n00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:15.222\n>> Now Mike, when you talk about\nmentioning saving it to the cloud here,\n\n537\n00:30:15.222 --> 00:30:18.813\nthere may be people out there that\nsay look, I don't trust that,\n\n538\n00:30:18.813 --> 00:30:23.013\nI'd rather save it to my laptop or my\ndesktop and I know it will be safe there.\n\n539\n00:30:23.013 --> 00:30:24.229\nMike, why should I even consider this.\n\n540\n00:30:24.229 --> 00:30:26.630\n>> Because of the convenience, right?\n\n541\n00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:29.890\nBecause of the face that\nif I save it locally,\n\n542\n00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:33.070\nI now have to, what if I want to\nwork with it while I'm on the road?\n\n543\n00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:34.420\nLet's say this is my desktop.\n\n544\n00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:35.940\nI can't take it with me.\n\n545\n00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:37.810\nWell, I've got to copy that\nfile to a thumb drive.\n\n546\n00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:40.730\nGot to take that thumb drive with me,\nplug it into my laptop,\n\n547\n00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:42.910\nand I can work with that document there.\n\n548\n00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:47.040\nWhen I get back to work, I've got to\nremember to plug that thumb drive back in,\n\n549\n00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:48.910\ncopy it back over to my local machine,\n\n550\n00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:51.470\nreplace the old file\nwith that new version.\n\n551\n00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:55.000\nYou end up with multiple versions and\nit gets really confusing.\n\n552\n00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.690\nWhen you're dealing with the Cloud, you're\nalways working with the same document,\n\n553\n00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:01.140\nyou're just accessing it\nfrom different locations.\n\n554\n00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.080\nIt's actually stored\nout there on the Cloud.\n\n555\n00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:05.620\nIf your hard drive fails,\nyou didn't lose your document.\n\n556\n00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:07.420\nIt's out there on the cloud, right?\n\n557\n00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:11.710\nMicrosoft's OneDrive, they've got\nunbelievable redundancy built in, right?\n\n558\n00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:13.400\nThey've taken care of all of that for me.\n\n559\n00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:16.245\nI don't have to worry about,\nI shouldn't say this out loud.\n\n560\n00:31:16.245 --> 00:31:17.750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But I don't have to worry about\n\n561\n00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:21.295\nbacking my stuff up because\nMicrosoft's doing it, right?\n\n562\n00:31:21.295 --> 00:31:25.650\n[LAUGH] That's probably not a good\nthing to say as an IT professional, but\n\n563\n00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:27.900\nwhen you think about it,\nit's kinda true, right?\n\n564\n00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:30.250\nThey've got redundant hardware solutions,\n\n565\n00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:33.830\nthey've got ways to make sure,\nthey're making money off this.\n\n566\n00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:37.060\nThey've got to make sure that they\ndon't lose customer's data, or\n\n567\n00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:39.100\nwe're not gonna pay for it anymore.\n\n568\n00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:41.530\nSo they're pretty safe.\n\n569\n00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:44.820\nSo it's the accessibility,\nthe convenience that you get.\n\n570\n00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:46.400\nNow if you don't have Cloud Storage,\n\n571\n00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.270\nyou don't trust Cloud storage,\nI say get with the times.\n\n572\n00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:50.294\nThat's where we're going.\n\n573\n00:31:50.294 --> 00:31:51.520\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n574\n00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.037\nMaybe you're using local\nstorage on your machine, but\n\n575\n00:31:54.037 --> 00:31:55.758\nmaybe local storage on your network.\n\n576\n00:31:55.758 --> 00:31:58.504\nThat's still a very common thing to do.\n\n577\n00:31:58.504 --> 00:32:02.410\nIf I want to If I have a document\nthat many people need access to,\n\n578\n00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:05.100\nI don't wanna share it out off my machine.\n\n579\n00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:08.540\nWe've got a folder up on our file\nserver on the network at work,\n\n580\n00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:09.910\nthat I can put things in.\n\n581\n00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:13.110\nAnd other people can go to that folder and\naccess that information.\n\n582\n00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:15.920\nRonnie says, hey Mike,\nyou got a copy of that spreadsheet, sure,\n\n583\n00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:20.440\nI'll dump it up in that share and\nyou can access it from there, right?\n\n584\n00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:21.440\nSo we need to be able to do that.\n\n585\n00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.140\nHow do you do that?\n\n586\n00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:26.790\nWell, you just go back to file, save or\nsave as, depending if it's a new document\n\n587\n00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:31.320\nor not, and then browse and\nfind your network location.\n\n588\n00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:35.110\nYou're either gonna have, depending on\nyour environment, you might have a mapped\n\n589\n00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:39.980\nnetwork drive or you might have\nto type in a UNC path up here.\n\n590\n00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:41.653\nRight, you can go \\\\,\n\n591\n00:32:41.653 --> 00:32:45.907\nI don't know if it'll let me\nbrowse this network, maybe not.\n\n592\n00:32:45.907 --> 00:32:49.417\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So if you don't have a Map Drive,\n\n593\n00:32:49.417 --> 00:32:53.486\nlike a permanent pointer to that\nshared folder on the network,\n\n594\n00:32:53.486 --> 00:32:55.739\nthen you have to know the UNC path.\n\n595\n00:32:55.739 --> 00:32:58.900\nRight, \\\\, computer name \\ share name.\n\n596\n00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:03.300\nIf you have it mapped, meaning it shows\nup as a drive in your local machine,\n\n597\n00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:05.790\nyou just select it from\nyour list over here.\n\n598\n00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:08.400\nAnd I can save it on that share.\n\n599\n00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.930\nI can dump it up in there, right?\n\n600\n00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:12.230\nAnd now I can tell Ronnie hey,\n\n601\n00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:15.230\ngo to that share and you'll see\nthat spreadsheet I'm working on.\n\n602\n00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:17.140\nMaybe you can give me some pointers on it.\n\n603\n00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:22.200\nSo being able to save it we can save it\nlocally, we can save it to a UNC path.\n\n604\n00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.630\nOr a shared folder on the network or\non another machine.\n\n605\n00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:28.050\nOr we can save it out there to the cloud.\n\n606\n00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:31.700\n>> Yeah, this idea of actually saving it\nin another location is pretty much a key\n\n607\n00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:36.030\nidea that we're going to be going to from\nnow, probably until the end of history.\n\n608\n00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:37.880\nBecause what we're finding out.\n\n609\n00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:41.400\nAnd we found out for a long time, right,\nis that even though you might depend on\n\n610\n00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:45.830\nyour hard drive, you shouldn't depend on\nyour hard drive when it comes down to it.\n\n611\n00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:49.040\nYour machine is not gonna have all\nthose backups and those redundancies.\n\n612\n00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:53.270\nSaving it to another location just ensures\nthat as long as you can access it,\n\n613\n00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:55.830\nyou have access to it and\nwhat you need to do to it.\n\n614\n00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:59.510\nAnd then, if you ever actually need to go\nto another machine because your hard drive\n\n615\n00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:01.930\nactually has died,\nyou're not now bringing and\n\n616\n00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:05.910\ngoing I hope you can help me find\nthe file and then there it is,\n\n617\n00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:10.280\nyour IT person says no, we can't recover\nany data off of it and it's lost.\n\n618\n00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:11.220\n>> Absolutely.\n\n619\n00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:14.400\nAnd I was working on a project for\na company here, and\n\n620\n00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:17.740\nit was a very complex Excel\nspreadsheet that we were working on.\n\n621\n00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:20.345\nAnd so I was working with it locally and\n\n622\n00:34:20.345 --> 00:34:25.210\nI found that I had seven different\nversions of this document.\n\n623\n00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:28.120\nBetween working on it here\nwhile I had a few minutes.\n\n624\n00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:32.408\nWorking on it at home, working on it on a\nwork station over in this business while I\n\n625\n00:34:32.408 --> 00:34:34.120\nwent over to visit them.\n\n626\n00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:37.768\nIt was really getting difficult to\nremember what the latest version was,\n\n627\n00:34:37.768 --> 00:34:42.230\nI'd go to show or my client the\nspreadsheet, say check out what I've got,\n\n628\n00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:46.090\nthat's not the right version,\nI left that on my other laptop, right.\n\n629\n00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:48.990\nPut that out in the cloud and\nit's all solved.\n\n630\n00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:52.079\nI can just go to any machine,\nconnect to the cloud, grab that file, and\n\n631\n00:34:52.079 --> 00:34:55.050\nI know it's the latest version,\nso a really good benefit.\n\n632\n00:34:55.050 --> 00:34:56.020\nIt really is.\n\n633\n00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:58.560\n>> Well, Mike, you've shown us\na lot here on printing and saving.\n\n634\n00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:01.052\nAny last words on printing and saving?\n\n635\n00:35:01.052 --> 00:35:03.800\n>> Not really,\nplay with some of those options in there.\n\n636\n00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:08.010\nAs far as the scaling goes because\nthere's no one size fits all,\n\n637\n00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:12.470\nit depends on how many columns,\nfont sizes, landscape versus portrait.\n\n638\n00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:14.910\nSo just play with the options and\nsee what's going to work best for you.\n\n639\n00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:16.960\nUse that print preview before you print.\n\n640\n00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:20.380\nYou don't want to go to the printer,\ngrab 20 pages and go that didn't work,\n\n641\n00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:22.090\nthrow it out and print it again.\n\n642\n00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:23.530\nSo use that print preview there.\n\n643\n00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:25.960\nTrust the cloud.\n\n644\n00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:28.160\n>> That's all that we have for\nthis episode.\n\n645\n00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.770\nSigning off for ITProTv, I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n646\n00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:31.610\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n647\n00:35:31.610

00:00:16.885\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan, and\n\n4\n00:00:16.885 --> 00:00:20.296\nin today's episode, we're going\nto be moving along in Excel 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:20.296 --> 00:00:24.790\nAnd today, we're going to be looking\nat how to order and group your data.\n\n6\n00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.345\nAnd who do we have here to help\nus out with this topic today?\n\n7\n00:00:27.345 --> 00:00:28.200\nMr. Mike Roderick.\n\n8\n00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.890\nHow you doing, Mike?\n\n9\n00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.970\n>> Doing great, Wes.\n\n10\n00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.510\nWe are all going to have\nsome fun with our data.\n\n11\n00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:33.390\nAnd exactly right.\n\n12\n00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.620\nWe're gonna try to put some order and\nsome grouping to it.\n\n13\n00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:36.940\nWe're actually gonna do a lot.\n\n14\n00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.410\nWe're gonna do some pretty cool\nformatting tricks as well.\n\n15\n00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.060\nSo, we're gonna start with something\ncalled conditional formatting.\n\n16\n00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.536\nNow in a previous episode, we've done\nsome formatting, we've made things bold,\n\n17\n00:00:49.536 --> 00:00:51.616\nwe've worked with the alignment, and\n\n18\n00:00:51.616 --> 00:00:55.671\nwe even changed the background color\nto give it like a highlighting effect.\n\n19\n00:00:55.671 --> 00:01:00.525\nBut now what I want to do is I want\nto apply these styles to these cells\n\n20\n00:01:00.525 --> 00:01:01.921\nbased on the data.\n\n21\n00:01:01.921 --> 00:01:02.670\nRight?\n\n22\n00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.224\nConditional formatting,\n\n23\n00:01:04.224 --> 00:01:08.754\nthat means we're gonna format it\nconditionally based on certain conditions.\n\n24\n00:01:08.754 --> 00:01:13.087\nSo let me show you the really\nneat things that Excel can do.\n\n25\n00:01:13.087 --> 00:01:14.630\nWe've always been able to\ndo conditional formatting.\n\n26\n00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.387\nWe've been able to go in and write\nrules and say, if a number was greater\n\n27\n00:01:19.387 --> 00:01:24.420\nthan such and such, maybe color it\na certain color, or make it bold.\n\n28\n00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.080\nBut now, with the Excel 2016,\nit's not brand new to 2016,\n\n29\n00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.290\nit was actually in 2013 as well,\nwe can do some pretty neat things.\n\n30\n00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.510\nLet's take a look.\n\n31\n00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.010\nOn my screen here, I've got that\nchart we've been working with.\n\n32\n00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.440\nI say chart, this data set that we've\nbeen working with, my monthly sales.\n\n33\n00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.780\nAnd I've got months going across the top,\n\n34\n00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.090\nI've got my categories that\nwe sell down across the side.\n\n35\n00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.837\nAnd then some values out here.\n\n36\n00:01:46.837 --> 00:01:49.663\nAnd as I said,\npreviously we did this manually.\n\n37\n00:01:49.663 --> 00:01:52.718\nRight?\nI colored the background of these cells\n\n38\n00:01:52.718 --> 00:01:55.820\nusing the cell styles and just did that.\n\n39\n00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.260\nBut it's regardless of\nthe data that's in there.\n\n40\n00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.788\nI could take the number 22 there and\ngo ahead and make it look bad.\n\n41\n00:02:02.788 --> 00:02:05.310\nRight?\nSo, we're just kinda doing that manually.\n\n42\n00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.090\n>> Yeah, so one other things I was\nthinking too on this one is, okay,\n\n43\n00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.710\nyou got good and bad, right?\n\n44\n00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.510\nRed and green here.\n\n45\n00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.220\nOne of the things I'm thinking is if,\nwe had good sales numbers, right?\n\n46\n00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.653\nWe might wanna know that the numbers are\ngood just by looking at the spreadsheet or\n\n47\n00:02:18.653 --> 00:02:19.671\nif the numbers are bad.\n\n48\n00:02:19.671 --> 00:02:23.636\nAnd not have to go manually through that\nprocess on every single cell saying yep,\n\n49\n00:02:23.636 --> 00:02:26.040\nthis is good, this is bad,\nthis is what we want.\n\n50\n00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.290\nSo is there a way that we can do that?\n\n51\n00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.110\n>> Absolutely.\n\n52\n00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.340\nAs our data sets get larger and\nlarger, or if it's changing data.\n\n53\n00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.290\nRight?\nI want that formatting to change.\n\n54\n00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.760\nWhat if that number changes from 0 to 15?\n\n55\n00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.520\nI guess it wouldn't change in the past.\n\n56\n00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.240\nBut depending on what your data contains,\nyou might have numbers that change.\n\n57\n00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.780\nAnd as those numbers change you\nwould want that formatting a change.\n\n58\n00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.730\nIf they brought those numbers up, then\nwe want to highlight them with something\n\n59\n00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.740\nthat indicates that those\nnumbers are now good,\n\n60\n00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.380\nor they're above a certain bar,\nwhatever level we set.\n\n61\n00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.950\nAnd so, let's take a look.\n\n62\n00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.500\nThe first thing I'm going to\ndo is I'm going to get rid of\n\n63\n00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.220\nthe formatting that we've already done.\n\n64\n00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.260\nSo, I'm going to clear my formatting.\n\n65\n00:03:05.372 --> 00:03:07.420\nAnd I'll go ahead and\ncenter align those guys again,\n\n66\n00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.760\njust because I think it makes\nit a little bit easier to read.\n\n67\n00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.430\nNow I'm gonna select my data,\nthat's the first thing I've gotta do.\n\n68\n00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.290\nAnd on my home ribbon I've got\nmy conditional formatting.\n\n69\n00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.340\nAnd we'll click that, and it's drop down,\nit's going to give me a few options.\n\n70\n00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.640\nI've got my highlight cells rules.\n\n71\n00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.000\nAnd we'll just start here, and kind of,\nwork our way down through a few of these.\n\n72\n00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.540\nI won't be able to do every one of them.\n\n73\n00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.720\nYou're gonna have to\nexplore some of these.\n\n74\n00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.660\nBut the highlight cells, it's kind of\nwhat I was doing manually, a minute ago.\n\n75\n00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.350\nBut let's say now,\nI've got a number in mind.\n\n76\n00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.950\nIf it's over ten,\nI want it to be highlighted.\n\n77\n00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.950\nWell I can say highlight cells greater\nthan, and I can fill in a value and\n\n78\n00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.345\nlet's make it something where a few\nmore shall, we'll say over five.\n\n79\n00:03:51.345 --> 00:03:52.675\nAll right?\nAnd I wanna fill it in,\n\n80\n00:03:52.675 --> 00:03:54.530\nif it's over five, it's good.\n\n81\n00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.910\nSo I'm gonna change that to\ngreen with dark green text.\n\n82\n00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.190\nClick OK.\n\n83\n00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.754\nAnd there you go.\nRight?\n\n84\n00:04:00.754 --> 00:04:04.030\nNow if one of these\nnumbers happen to change.\n\n85\n00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.230\nThis was a four so it's not highlighted.\n\n86\n00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.780\nNow it's 11.\n\n87\n00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.600\nAnd look at that.\n\n88\n00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.040\nIt automatically turns green.\n\n89\n00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.600\nRight?\nSo\n\n90\n00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.730\nthat's an example of\nconditional formatting.\n\n91\n00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:14.850\nLet me undo that.\n\n92\n00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.610\nAnd we'll try another one of those,\ncuz there are several.\n\n93\n00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.200\nSo you get the highlight cells, that's\nwhat I was just doing, greater than,\n\n94\n00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.440\nless than a particular number\nbetween a certain number range.\n\n95\n00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.197\nI want it highlight it if\nit's between five and ten.\n\n96\n00:04:30.197 --> 00:04:30.850\nRight?\n\n97\n00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:31.790\nYou can do that.\n\n98\n00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.470\nIf it's equal to, or if text contained.\n\n99\n00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.180\nSo we can even do this with text.\n\n100\n00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.825\nIf a date occurring is within a certain\nrange, maybe we had a sale going on,\n\n101\n00:04:42.825 --> 00:04:47.757\nand if the date was between\nthe Black Friday, November 27th and\n\n102\n00:04:47.757 --> 00:04:53.337\nNovember 30th or whatever that\nBlack Friday weekend was here in the US.\n\n103\n00:04:53.337 --> 00:04:57.470\nI want it to show up in a different color,\ncuz we gotta apply a discount to it.\n\n104\n00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.010\nRight?\nI can do that with this.\n\n105\n00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.855\nOr if there's duplicate values.\n\n106\n00:05:00.855 --> 00:05:03.260\nIt'll go and\nhighlight all those duplicate values.\n\n107\n00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.750\nSo those are some pretty standard ones.\n\n108\n00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.510\nAnd then you've got this top and\nbottom rows.\n\n109\n00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.280\nAnd I really like this as well.\n\n110\n00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.550\nEspecially when you're\nworking with large data sets.\n\n111\n00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.000\nSometimes it's hard to figure out\nwhat your top ten sellers where.\n\n112\n00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.200\nWell I can to top rules and\nchoose top ten items.\n\n113\n00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.100\nNow it says top ten.\n\n114\n00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.010\nBut you're not stuck with that.\n\n115\n00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.130\nIf you want your top 15 or\nyour top 5, you can do that.\n\n116\n00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.640\nThe rule is called top ten because\nit defaults to the number ten.\n\n117\n00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.430\nBut if you want to change that to\nthe top five, you can certainly do that.\n\n118\n00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:39.120\nAnd you can even see it changing on me in\nthe background as I change these numbers.\n\n119\n00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.590\nIf I want the top 20.\n\n120\n00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.300\nRight?\n\n121\n00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.800\nAnd if they're at the top,\nI might not want red, maybe I want green.\n\n122\n00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.330\nAnd you're not stuck with\nthese pre-builds either.\n\n123\n00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.300\nYou can always go to Custom Format.\n\n124\n00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.590\nIf it's in the top 20,\nthen I wanna make it.\n\n125\n00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:53.920\nlet's do something else.\n\n126\n00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:59.460\nLet's do color is going to be green.\n\n127\n00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.796\nAnd I wanna make it bold.\n\n128\n00:06:00.796 --> 00:06:01.629\nAll right?\n\n129\n00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:02.629\nAnd I want to, we'll do that.\n\n130\n00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:04.100\nWe'll say OK.\n\n131\n00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.390\nAll right?\n\n132\n00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.640\nSo now I'll click OK, and there you go.\n\n133\n00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.380\nI'll click away from it, you can see it.\n\n134\n00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.400\nNow those top 20 numbers are green and\nbold.\n\n135\n00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:14.740\nLet me undo that one.\n\n136\n00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.980\nSo that's another example\nof conditional formatting.\n\n137\n00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.880\nAnd let's just keep going down the rules.\n\n138\n00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.754\nThe top and bottom you've got the top ten.\n\n139\n00:06:20.754 --> 00:06:22.296\nThe top percent.\n\n140\n00:06:22.296 --> 00:06:23.672\nAgain you're not stuck\nwith the number ten.\n\n141\n00:06:23.672 --> 00:06:25.340\nThey have to put something on a menu.\n\n142\n00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:25.910\nRight?\n\n143\n00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.711\nSo you can do the top 10 or\ntop 25% or the top 2%.\n\n144\n00:06:29.711 --> 00:06:33.050\nYou can also do the bottom 10 or\nthe bottom 10%.\n\n145\n00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.790\nIf they're above the average.\n\n146\n00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:35.920\nHow cool is that?\n\n147\n00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.921\nBecause it's gonna figure\nout what the average is.\n\n148\n00:06:38.921 --> 00:06:40.920\nRight?\nOf all your numbers you have selected.\n\n149\n00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:46.810\nAnd then I'm gonna say I wanna make\nthat a red border, and click OK.\n\n150\n00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.080\nSo it happens that all my dog\nsales are the top sales up there.\n\n151\n00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.360\nSo depending on what you're trying to do,\nbut\n\n152\n00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.070\nI didn't have to know\nwhat the average was.\n\n153\n00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.620\nAs those numbers change,\nthe average changes.\n\n154\n00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.270\nIt's gonna keep track of that and\n\n155\n00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:06.330\nautomatically put a red border around\nthe top whatever percent I choose.\n\n156\n00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:07.330\nFantastic stuff.\n\n157\n00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.653\nWe've got the below average as well.\n\n158\n00:07:11.653 --> 00:07:15.890\nNow, those are cool but\nwe haven't even seen the best once yet.\n\n159\n00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:18.460\nAs I go down here, look at these.\n\n160\n00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:19.950\nI just like these, Wes.\n\n161\n00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:22.400\nNow we get to Data Bars, all right?\n\n162\n00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.740\nAnd Data Bars allow me to\ndo this gradient fill.\n\n163\n00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.628\nAnd look as I hover over\nthat what that's doing.\n\n164\n00:07:28.628 --> 00:07:29.350\nAll right?\n\n165\n00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:30.310\nIn fact I'll just click on it so\n\n166\n00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:31.882\nyou can go see it,\nwe can see it a little better here.\n\n167\n00:07:31.882 --> 00:07:34.130\nSo you see how the bigger the number,\n\n168\n00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.640\nthe more the cell is\nfilled with that gradient?\n\n169\n00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.212\nThe smaller numbers,\nit's just filled just a little bit.\n\n170\n00:07:39.212 --> 00:07:41.400\nI mean, how cool is that?\n\n171\n00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:45.586\nThe problem with numbers sometimes,\nwhen you're looking at data sets and\n\n172\n00:07:45.586 --> 00:07:47.254\nespecially large data sets.\n\n173\n00:07:47.254 --> 00:07:49.921\nIt's hard to pick out the big numbers or\nthe good numbers or\n\n174\n00:07:49.921 --> 00:07:53.308\nthe ones I really need to see,\ncuz they all just start blurring together.\n\n175\n00:07:53.308 --> 00:07:58.033\nAnd when you're scrolling to rows and rows\nand rows of data, you miss some in there.\n\n176\n00:07:58.033 --> 00:07:58.533\nRight?\n\n177\n00:07:58.533 --> 00:08:01.608\nBy doing things like this,\nI still have the numbers.\n\n178\n00:08:01.608 --> 00:08:04.748\nBut now I've got a visual\nindicator as well.\n\n179\n00:08:04.748 --> 00:08:07.550\nSo these can be really powerful for\n\n180\n00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:12.650\nhelp interpreting the data,\nas well as presenting the data.\n\n181\n00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:16.780\nSo we've got that the Data Bars, and I\ncan do different colored gradients there.\n\n182\n00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:20.630\nI also have a solid fill if\nI don't want the gradient.\n\n183\n00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:26.240\nBut wait, there's more if you but Excel\nright now, we can also do color scales.\n\n184\n00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.290\nAll right, how was that?\n\n185\n00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:33.850\nLet me hear at those data bar\nactually before I move on to that.\n\n186\n00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:37.420\nAll right, but you know you can actually\napply more than one to the same cells.\n\n187\n00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:41.950\nWe can do color scales I don't\neven have to make up my rules.\n\n188\n00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:43.750\nI don't have to decide my numbers.\n\n189\n00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:44.660\nIt's just gonna say, okay,\n\n190\n00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.430\nthe lowest numbers out of all\nthe numbers are gonna be red.\n\n191\n00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.130\nAnd as the numbers get bigger,\n\n192\n00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:52.890\nwhat it does is it says,\nthe smallest number, I'm gonna make red.\n\n193\n00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:54.860\nThe largest number, I'm gonna make green.\n\n194\n00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.870\nAnd then the numbers in between?\n\n195\n00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:01.010\nIt's gonna use a sliding scale between\ngreen and red, so you can see It kind of\n\n196\n00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:06.510\ngoes orange, and then yellow, and\nthen light green, and then dark green.\n\n197\n00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:10.870\nAs it slides through that scale you've got\nthe different colors that you can use,\n\n198\n00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:13.420\ndepending on what you\nare trying to represent.\n\n199\n00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.790\nAnd that's not it.\n\n200\n00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:16.880\nLook at icon sets.\n\n201\n00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.380\nI really like this one.\n\n202\n00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.700\nTalk about a great visual indicator.\n\n203\n00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.540\nWe can use arrows, all right,\n\n204\n00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.760\nso I can see that the number I can\nput little triangles out there.\n\n205\n00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:32.370\nWe can do a stop, like a stop light,\na green, yellow, and red light.\n\n206\n00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:38.280\nWe can do little flags, we can check\nmarks, and exclamations and exes.\n\n207\n00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:42.870\nNow you've got rating systems down here,\nwe can see the star starts to fill up\n\n208\n00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:48.840\ngradually or little bars like our cell\nphone reception signals that we can use.\n\n209\n00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:52.550\nOur little circles that fill\nin the pieces of the pie\n\n210\n00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.790\nas the number gets closer\nto the larger number.\n\n211\n00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:58.450\nAnd again what we've got to remember\nis it's all dynamic, right?\n\n212\n00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:01.070\nIt knows what the biggest\nnumber in that spreadsheet is.\n\n213\n00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:06.070\nFor example let's do the,\nwell we'll do the pies here.\n\n214\n00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:09.730\nRight, so 22 is about my biggest\nnumbers so I gonna solid circle.\n\n215\n00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:15.200\nBut one of this numbers was to change to,\nlet's change this one to 50.\n\n216\n00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.750\n22 is no longer the biggest number right?\n\n217\n00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.830\nSo I'd see 22 is about a half of 50 and\n\n218\n00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:23.010\nthe rest of these don't\neven register anymore.\n\n219\n00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:24.870\nSo as those numbers change.\n\n220\n00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:28.180\nThis is all gonna change dynamically.\n\n221\n00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:33.600\nWell, that's impressive stuff, and\nagain it's a great visual indicator.\n\n222\n00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.310\nAnd sometimes that's really what you need\n\n223\n00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:38.780\nwhen you're looking at\nthese large data sets.\n\n224\n00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.380\n>> Well, that's funny because Is\nthe fisherman in me there didn't see\n\n225\n00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.560\npies I would see where that would\nbe perfect for doing tide charts.\n\n226\n00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:48.170\nAnd you're configuring the moon and\nthe certain level\n\n227\n00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:50.990\nof the moon on a certain date and,\nhey, we'd know when to go fishing.\n\n228\n00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:52.630\nWell it's always a good\ntime to fish anyways.\n\n229\n00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:54.005\nBut, yeah, very neat.\n\n230\n00:10:54.005 --> 00:10:55.060\n>> [LAUGH] Absolutely.\n\n231\n00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:58.070\nSo, lots of cool things you can do\nwith the conditional forwarding.\n\n232\n00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:01.870\nYou still have your old school,\nI say old school rules, right?\n\n233\n00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.240\nI can go here and\nI can click new rules and\n\n234\n00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.290\nI can still make my rules\nthe way we used to.\n\n235\n00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:11.540\nOr if I've got a format all\nsales based on the value.\n\n236\n00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:15.610\nAnd I can set the lowest and\nthe highest, and pick my gradients, or\n\n237\n00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:17.880\nthe colors and the background or\nwhat have you.\n\n238\n00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:22.670\nBut they've made it much much easier\nto do, with these pre built ones and\n\n239\n00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:28.000\nthe fact that I can see it as I hover\nover it, it's fantastic, a live preview.\n\n240\n00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.120\nAll right, now the other\nthing we can do that helps us\n\n241\n00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.015\nto view the data visually is\nsomething called spark lines.\n\n242\n00:11:35.015 --> 00:11:42.480\nSparklines are miniature drafts\nthat we can insert Into ourselves.\n\n243\n00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:46.520\nFor example, let me give myself\na little room on the side here.\n\n244\n00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:52.720\nI'm gonna select this numbers,\nactually before I do that let me go.\n\n245\n00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:57.728\nI'm gonna put the Sparkline right out here\nnext to my number and on my insert ribbon\n\n246\n00:11:57.728 --> 00:12:02.230\nI have Sparklines and I'll choose the\nfirst one here which is outline and graph.\n\n247\n00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:07.490\nAnd ask me, well what data that you\nwant to use for this Sparkline?\n\n248\n00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:08.580\nAnd I select my data.\n\n249\n00:12:10.531 --> 00:12:12.141\nAnd I'll hit okay, and now,\n\n250\n00:12:12.141 --> 00:12:15.500\nI'm gonna get a little graph\nthat's representing the data.\n\n251\n00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:19.820\nNow, I'm gonna use our trick we learned in\nthe previous episode, serious fill, and\n\n252\n00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.540\ndrag that down.\n\n253\n00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.330\nAnd now I've got Sparkline for\n\n254\n00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:27.280\neach one of these series', so you can see\nthis little tiny graph that represent.\n\n255\n00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:32.460\nIf I just to show you how accurate it is,\nby drop this to a zero, Right?\n\n256\n00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.400\nYou see the big dip now in the Sparkline?\n\n257\n00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:39.830\nSo it's an actual graph of the data,\nit's not just a squishy line.\n\n258\n00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:41.500\nThat is an accurate graph,\n\n259\n00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:47.400\nif I put a ten in here you're going to\nsee a big spike now in that Sparkline.\n\n260\n00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.140\nSo, fantastic, right?\n\n261\n00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:52.700\nAnd the line is one type that you can do.\n\n262\n00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:54.070\nAnother one you can do.\n\n263\n00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:57.850\nLet's go back over to insert and\nwe can do a column.\n\n264\n00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.319\nAnd again I'll grab my data.\n\n265\n00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:06.540\nAnd we'll click okay, and I'll do\na little series fill on that one as well.\n\n266\n00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:10.440\nAnd now you got a little column\nchart that represents your data,\n\n267\n00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.730\nagain a great visual indicator.\n\n268\n00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:17.351\nNow if you had data that looked like this,\n2, 3,\n\n269\n00:13:17.351 --> 00:13:22.630\n4,6, 8,\n9 I'm just kind of making up some numbers.\n\n270\n00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:23.900\nI will show you what I\nmean here in a second.\n\n271\n00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:27.470\n6, 4, 2, 1, 1.\n\n272\n00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:30.480\nYou look at these numbers and\nyou don't see the pattern.\n\n273\n00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.530\nYou look at this and\n\n274\n00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:36.170\nyou go wow the middle of the year\nwe've got a real spike in sales.\n\n275\n00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:39.760\nThat's the kind of thing that you can\nget with these visual indicators that is\n\n276\n00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:43.740\nsometimes hard to get when you're\njust looking at the raw numbers.\n\n277\n00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.650\nAnd this is a relatively small data set,\nright?\n\n278\n00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:49.660\nSo you can probably spot that\nI've got a spike in numbers,\n\n279\n00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.000\nhere in the middle of the year.\n\n280\n00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.940\nBut imagine this being a much larger\ndata set with thousands of data points.\n\n281\n00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:59.665\nReally hard to get that\nwithout that visual indicator.\n\n282\n00:13:59.665 --> 00:14:00.770\nUh-huh.\n\n283\n00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:04.050\n>> Mike I was gonna, and one of the things\nthat we did in a previous episode, and\n\n284\n00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:06.510\nif you guys haven't seen that episode,\ngo back and check it out.\n\n285\n00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:09.640\nYou showed us how to make it a little\nbit easier and less tedious.\n\n286\n00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.720\nHow entering that information line by\nline, so he showed us how to use, like for\n\n287\n00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.230\ninstance, CSV file.\n\n288\n00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:18.210\nCommon Separated Value,\nif I can even say that acronym there.\n\n289\n00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:22.780\nAnd it just imports that information and\nit separates our rows and our columns.\n\n290\n00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:24.780\nNow what if you've changed your mind.\n\n291\n00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.286\nAnd you notice how you got\nthe months across the top and,\n\n292\n00:14:27.286 --> 00:14:30.874\nI almost said products but I don't think\nyou'd say your animals are products.\n\n293\n00:14:30.874 --> 00:14:32.950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They'd love me out there for that one.\n\n294\n00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:34.370\nAnd you've got your animals down the side.\n\n295\n00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:37.180\nWhat if you wanna rearrange that a little\nbit because maybe you've changed your mind\n\n296\n00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.780\nand it's not suiting your needs now?\n\n297\n00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:42.030\n>> It's too late, you've already done it,\nyou can't change your mind.\n\n298\n00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:42.700\n>> Oh that's it, game over.\n\n299\n00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:43.510\n>> No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.\n\n300\n00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:45.780\nExcel can help us out with that as well.\n\n301\n00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:49.000\nLet's see so if we wanted to take this and\nmaybe I would rather have as what it's\n\n302\n00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.380\nsaying, I'd rather have the months\ngoing down vertically there.\n\n303\n00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:57.470\nRight down that left hand side and\nthen my categories across the top.\n\n304\n00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:59.290\nThe dogs, cats, and birds.\n\n305\n00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:00.180\nEasy enough.\n\n306\n00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:04.810\nAll I have to do is select my data and\nthen copy it.\n\n307\n00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:07.540\nAnd then I'm going to paste it.\n\n308\n00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.140\nNow I'll grab another worksheet just so\n\n309\n00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:12.260\nwe can kind of keep our\nwork space clean here.\n\n310\n00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.860\nI'm going to paste the data here,\nbut instead of just pasting it,\n\n311\n00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:19.700\nI'm going to do a special paste,\nlike we did in a previous episode.\n\n312\n00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.600\nI hit my little drop down list.\n\n313\n00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.330\nAnd this icon right here.\n\n314\n00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:27.190\nIt's kinda hard to see but\nwhen you hover over it says transpose and\n\n315\n00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:29.770\nI'll click and there you go.\n\n316\n00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:31.350\nNow your data is represented.\n\n317\n00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:32.460\nSame data, right?\n\n318\n00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:33.610\nThe numbers didn't change.\n\n319\n00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:35.540\nThe dogs are still the big sellers, right?\n\n320\n00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:38.370\nI've got that spike in\nthe middle of my miscellaneous.\n\n321\n00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:40.500\nIt's just now the categories\nare going across the top.\n\n322\n00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:45.310\nAnd I've got the months as my Y axis or\ngoing over there vertically.\n\n323\n00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:46.080\nSo easy to do.\n\n324\n00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:50.980\nIf you've got a dataset like that, it's\nwhat they call transposing the rows and\n\n325\n00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:51.638\ncolumns.\n\n326\n00:15:51.638 --> 00:15:56.136\nAnd if you need to do that, simply copy\nit, grab all that data, copy it and\n\n327\n00:15:56.136 --> 00:15:57.088\nthen paste it.\n\n328\n00:15:57.088 --> 00:16:00.018\nBut do a paste special and\nchoose the Transpose.\n\n329\n00:16:00.018 --> 00:16:01.538\nAnd Excel will do it for you.\n\n330\n00:16:01.538 --> 00:16:03.288\nAnd then you can delete\nthe one that you copied.\n\n331\n00:16:03.288 --> 00:16:06.850\nLike I could go back,\nif we decided this way was better.\n\n332\n00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:11.180\nWell, I can go back and now delete this\nonce I've copied it and transposed it.\n\n333\n00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:13.940\nSo, very easy to do there within Excel.\n\n334\n00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:18.570\nAll right, so a lot of cool things\nyou can do with the formatting.\n\n335\n00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:21.240\nThe next one's gonna be\na little more complex, but\n\n336\n00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:25.430\nI wanna show you how to do what we\ncall an outline in Excel, all right?\n\n337\n00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:30.115\nAnd it's not quite what you think of\nan outline like with a Word document or\n\n338\n00:16:30.115 --> 00:16:31.920\nsomething like that.\n\n339\n00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:38.350\nAn outline in Excel gives us the ability\nto group data and then collapse data up.\n\n340\n00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:42.950\nAnd it's especially handy when you're\nworking with large amounts of data and\n\n341\n00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:47.350\nyou need to be able to look at\na summary view of the information,\n\n342\n00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:49.830\nas well as see all the raw data,\nall right?\n\n343\n00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:51.890\nSo let me flip over to\nanother workbook here and\n\n344\n00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:54.790\nI'll show you how to do this and\nwhat I mean.\n\n345\n00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:59.540\nSo on this sheet here,\nif we jump down to the bottom,\n\n346\n00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:03.115\nwe got about 2,500 rows of data in here.\n\n347\n00:17:03.115 --> 00:17:08.660\nNow, what I would like to do is I\nwanna see how many dogs did we sell?\n\n348\n00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:11.560\nHow much money did we make\non selling dogs versus cats,\n\n349\n00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:14.170\nversus fish, versus birds, et cetera?\n\n350\n00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:19.490\nAll the data right now is in this one big,\nlong list with about 2,500 rows.\n\n351\n00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:22.462\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngoing to create an outline.\n\n352\n00:17:22.462 --> 00:17:26.380\nI'm gonna group the data,\nput some subtotals in there, and\n\n353\n00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:27.760\ncreate an outline out of it.\n\n354\n00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.390\nAnd Excel makes it\nextremely easy nowadays.\n\n355\n00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:34.750\nA few Office editions ago,\nthis was not quite as easy.\n\n356\n00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:38.020\nSo if you're gonna do that, the first\nthing you would need to do is sort it\n\n357\n00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:40.530\nby whatever you wanna group it by,\nall right?\n\n358\n00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:41.880\nNow, I'm gonna group it by category.\n\n359\n00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:45.210\nAnd as we scroll down through here,\nwe can see it's not organized.\n\n360\n00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:48.000\nRight, I've got dogs,\nbirds, cats, dogs, cats.\n\n361\n00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.180\nSo it's not sorted yet.\n\n362\n00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.880\nSo let's sort that by category.\n\n363\n00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.860\nSo I'm gonna do that by using my Sort and\nFilter.\n\n364\n00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:56.210\nAnd we'll do it just A to Z.\n\n365\n00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:01.540\nSo now as you look through here,\nthere's all my bird sales.\n\n366\n00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:04.100\nEventually we'll get down to,\nwhat would be next,\n\n367\n00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:06.370\ncats I guess would come after birds.\n\n368\n00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:07.290\nThat's a lot of scrolling.\n\n369\n00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:08.158\nThere's my cats.\n\n370\n00:18:08.158 --> 00:18:13.598\nSo at this point it is all\nsorted by category, all right.\n\n371\n00:18:13.598 --> 00:18:18.110\nNow, the next thing I wanna do is\nI wanna insert some subtotals.\n\n372\n00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:22.720\nSo now I'm gonna go to my,\nwhere are we at here, my Insert.\n\n373\n00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:26.890\nI'm sorry, not my Insert, my Data ribbon,\nand I'm gonna choose Subtotal.\n\n374\n00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:30.940\nNow, I have to make sure\nthat my active cell\n\n375\n00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:35.030\nis in the column that I wanna create\nthe subtotals based on, right?\n\n376\n00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:39.260\nIf it's over here, it's gonna try to\ncreate a subtotal based on store.\n\n377\n00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:44.220\nAnd because it's not sorted properly\nExcel is gonna have a problem with that.\n\n378\n00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:48.600\nSo I wanna make sure I sort the column,\nand then I have that column selector, or\n\n379\n00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:53.980\nthe active sell is in that column, and\nI'm gonna click on Subtotal, all right.\n\n380\n00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:59.940\nThen it's gonna say, at each change in,\nand this is where you've gotta watch it,\n\n381\n00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:03.580\nI selected that category, but\nExcel didn't even recognize it.\n\n382\n00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:10.760\nSo I'm gonna make sure I tell Excel at\neach change in category, all right.\n\n383\n00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:15.060\nSo, each time this change,\nright now it's birds, once its changes,\n\n384\n00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.970\nit changes to cats next,\nthat's the break point.\n\n385\n00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:19.550\nThat's what I'm telling Excel.\n\n386\n00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:22.840\nEvery time the category changes,\nwhat do I wanna do?\n\n387\n00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:26.420\nI could do a count,\nmaybe I just wanna see how many.\n\n388\n00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:27.610\nLet's do a sum though.\n\n389\n00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:32.370\nWe'll say a sum, and\nI wanna do a sum of the amount, right?\n\n390\n00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:34.420\nThat would make the most sense.\n\n391\n00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:40.558\nAnd I'm gonna put the summary below\nthe data, and I'll go ahead and click OK.\n\n392\n00:19:40.558 --> 00:19:45.132\nAnd it whirs and grinds for a second and\nit doesn't really look like anything\n\n393\n00:19:45.132 --> 00:19:48.578\nhappened, except I've got\nthis extra space over here.\n\n394\n00:19:48.578 --> 00:19:54.413\nAnd if I scroll down, and\nI get back down to where that change is,\n\n395\n00:19:54.413 --> 00:20:01.110\neventually, a lot of birds we sell,\nthere I can see my birds total.\n\n396\n00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:04.430\nAnd there's my total,\nmy subtotal for birds, right?\n\n397\n00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:06.030\nAnd then it starts in cats.\n\n398\n00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:08.980\nAnd so,\nthat's pretty cool to know of itself but\n\n399\n00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:12.260\nit's these over here that\nare really pretty neat, as well.\n\n400\n00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.360\nThis is the outline part, right?\n\n401\n00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:18.280\nSo you saw me create the groups and\ncreate the subtotals.\n\n402\n00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:21.550\nNow we wanna work with the outline and\nit did it for me.\n\n403\n00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:26.170\nWhen I inserted the subtotal, it created\nthe groups as well as the outline.\n\n404\n00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:28.710\nWhat these numbers represent is the level.\n\n405\n00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:33.220\nSo if I click on level one,\neverything is gonna collapse up, and\n\n406\n00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:35.610\nlook at that,\nall I have is the grand total.\n\n407\n00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.980\nMan, we make a lot of\nmoney selling animals.\n\n408\n00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:39.690\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n409\n00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:42.650\nBut if I wanna see a little more detail\nthan that I can go to level two.\n\n410\n00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:49.060\nAnd there's each one of my categories and\ntheir totals.\n\n411\n00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:54.370\nIf I go to level three, I'm back out to\nthe actual data, everything's expanded.\n\n412\n00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:56.170\nOr if I just wanna see\na particular category,\n\n413\n00:20:56.170 --> 00:21:00.620\nI could jump back over to two,\nand then expand out cats.\n\n414\n00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:02.550\nAnd there's all the cat data.\n\n415\n00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:04.640\nAll the others are still collapsed.\n\n416\n00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:08.810\nSo these little plus and\nminus signs allow me to collapse or\n\n417\n00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:11.010\nexpand a particular section.\n\n418\n00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:18.320\nAnd that's what that outline allows\nme to do is to really focus in on or\n\n419\n00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:22.220\ncreate that ability to\ncollapse the data down,\n\n420\n00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:26.170\nview those subtotals, but\nthen expand it out if I need to.\n\n421\n00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:30.740\nA lot of times the higher ups, my boss\ndoesn't care about the individual sales,\n\n422\n00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:32.920\nthey just want to know what we're doing.\n\n423\n00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:37.590\nShould we continue to sell reptiles or\ndogs or cats?\n\n424\n00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:39.120\nIs it worth the cost?\n\n425\n00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.840\nThey need to see these overall numbers.\n\n426\n00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:45.800\nBut the person ordering might\nneed to see what species of bird\n\n427\n00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.310\nwe sell more than others.\n\n428\n00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:51.890\nSo they can expand out birds and\nthey can see that data.\n\n429\n00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:54.760\nSo that's the advantage of\ndoing those outlines there.\n\n430\n00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:55.910\nPretty cool.\n\n431\n00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:58.660\nPlay around with it a little bit,\n\n432\n00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:02.610\nyou can do a couple different\nlevels of subtotals in there.\n\n433\n00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:06.400\nFor example,\nlet's see if I can get this to work, Wes.\n\n434\n00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.790\nI try to add another subtotal.\n\n435\n00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:11.970\nAnd I'm going to say, we also wanna do a,\n\n436\n00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:15.230\nyeah it's not gonna let me\ndo that on this one, is it?\n\n437\n00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:19.890\nSo change that to account of the species,\nand\n\n438\n00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:23.160\nwe'll click OK, and see what we get now.\n\n439\n00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.566\nSo we get down to the bottom of Birds.\n\n440\n00:22:27.708 --> 00:22:29.860\nSee how nicely Excel played along with me.\n\n441\n00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:36.770\nAnd now you can see I've got my bird\ncount as well, as my bird total.\n\n442\n00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:37.960\nAnd oops, I left that checked.\n\n443\n00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:43.010\nYou'll notice I left Count selected\non the amount column as well.\n\n444\n00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:44.770\nSo I need to go back in there and\nfix that.\n\n445\n00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:49.674\nAnd I can go back into my outline here,\nand for the count function,\n\n446\n00:22:49.674 --> 00:22:51.786\nI'm gonna uncheck amount.\n\n447\n00:22:51.786 --> 00:22:57.386\nWe did a sum on the species.\n\n448\n00:22:57.386 --> 00:22:59.230\nOr, sorry that should\nhave been on the amount.\n\n449\n00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:06.488\nAnd we did the Count on the species,\nright?\n\n450\n00:23:06.488 --> 00:23:07.146\nYeah.\n\n451\n00:23:07.146 --> 00:23:11.210\nAnd then you can also create a new\npage if you wanna separate that out.\n\n452\n00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:13.200\nI'm not gonna change this again,\n\n453\n00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.300\nI don't wanna goof up my numbers\nthat I've already generated there.\n\n454\n00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:18.810\nBut you can see how I can\nplay around with that and\n\n455\n00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:22.540\nyou could add different\nsubtotals to those sections.\n\n456\n00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:27.730\nSo if I want to get a count, as well\nas a sum of the value, we can do that.\n\n457\n00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:29.715\nSo play around those outlines,\n\n458\n00:23:29.715 --> 00:23:33.570\nit gives you a great way to\ncollapse that information up.\n\n459\n00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:38.990\nNow I can see, I go back out to\nlevel three, and I've got the count,\n\n460\n00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:42.850\nas well as the sum for\neach one of those sections.\n\n461\n00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:45.810\nSo if that's all I need,\nI can hide all that other data.\n\n462\n00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:47.332\nI don't need to see all of that.\n\n463\n00:23:47.332 --> 00:23:50.420\nAnd if I need to see it,\nI can just expand it out,\n\n464\n00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:54.144\nand I can see all the details\nwithin that section.\n\n465\n00:23:54.144 --> 00:23:55.322\n>> That's great information.\n\n466\n00:23:55.322 --> 00:23:58.650\nAnd, man, I tell you what, it makes\nit very handy to see the information,\n\n467\n00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:01.860\nespecially when you've got many,\nmany lines within that spreadsheet.\n\n468\n00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:05.540\nSo we've looked at some really cool things\ntoday, how to apply conditional forwarding\n\n469\n00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.800\nto your spreadsheets,\nwe've looked at spark lines.\n\n470\n00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.970\nNice to have those little graphs\nat the end of that row, so\n\n471\n00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:13.060\nyou can really get a visualization\nof what the information means,\n\n472\n00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:15.100\nwithout having to go column by column.\n\n473\n00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:19.230\nWe've looked at transposing columns and\nrows, rearranging those columns and rows,\n\n474\n00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:21.970\nthe information within them,\nas well as outlines too.\n\n475\n00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:25.070\nAnd collapsing some of the groups\nthat the outlines bring to us,\n\n476\n00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:26.040\nmake it a little bit easier.\n\n477\n00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:27.550\nMike, do you have anything else for us?\n\n478\n00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:28.970\n>> Nope, I think that does it for\nthis one.\n\n479\n00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:31.510\n>> All right then,\nit looks like we're coming to the end of\n\n480\n00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:35.270\nanother episode here at ITProTV, so\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n481\n00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:37.960\nAnd signing on for ITPROTV,\nI'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n482\n00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:39.110\n>> And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n483\n00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:40.276\n>> And we'll see you next

Bryan.\n\n3\n00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.780\nIn today's episode we're going to\nbe moving along in Excel 2016.\n\n4\n00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.750\nAnd specifically we're going to be talking\nabout inserting and formatting your data.\n\n5\n00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.775\nAnd who do we have here to\nhelp us out with this topic?\n\n6\n00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:26.610\nMr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n7\n00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.520\nHow are you doing Mike?\n\n8\n00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.200\n>> Oh doing good.\n\n9\n00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.790\nYeah we're always looking to\nput new data in our worksheets.\n\n10\n00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.280\nAnd several different\nways we can go about it.\n\n11\n00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.630\nSo let's just dive right in and\nsee what we can do.\n\n12\n00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.790\nOne of the most basic ways that you can\nput new data into your worksheet is to\n\n13\n00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:40.940\nsimply type it in.\n\n14\n00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.660\nStandard data entry.\n\n15\n00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.300\nFor example,\nlet's take a look at what I've got here.\n\n16\n00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.030\nI'm going to jump down to\nthe bottom of my spreadsheet and\n\n17\n00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.290\nI'm going to type in a new sale.\n\n18\n00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.919\nI'll put my sales person's ID in there.\n\n19\n00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.290\nAnd I'll put the category\nof animal that they sold.\n\n20\n00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.860\nAnd you'll notice that as I type,\nExcel is gonna try to fill it in for me.\n\n21\n00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.860\nIt looks at the column that I'm in, it\nlooks at the other values in that column.\n\n22\n00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.040\nI type the letter b,\n\n23\n00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.920\nand it says wait, the word bird has\nbeen used before in this column.\n\n24\n00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.940\nMaybe that's what Mike is trying to type,\nand it fills it in for me.\n\n25\n00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.870\nAnd if that's what I want I simply\nhit Tab and move on to the next cell.\n\n26\n00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.280\nAnd I'll start typing in\nthe type of bird that I sold.\n\n27\n00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.690\nI hit the letter A, and\nthere goes African Grey.\n\n28\n00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.660\nIf I had wanted to type in something else,\nlike Albatross, it's gonna let me.\n\n29\n00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.850\nI just continue to type\nwhatever it is I want to type.\n\n30\n00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.010\nBut if it figures out what I wanna type,\nI simply hit Tab and\n\n31\n00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.580\nlet it do the work, and\nmove on to the next cell.\n\n32\n00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.790\nSo we'll put in, that was down in Tampa.\n\n33\n00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.380\nWe'll make up a dollar value.\n\n34\n00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.500\nAnd we'll put a date in there.\n\n35\n00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.361\nAnd we'll be good to go.\n\n36\n00:01:49.361 --> 00:01:51.661\nWell that's not going to work for\na date, is it Wes?\n\n37\n00:01:51.661 --> 00:01:52.681\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's back up.\n\n38\n00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:55.175\nI don't think there's a day zero.\n\n39\n00:01:55.175 --> 00:01:57.679\nPut our date in there and\nwe're good to go.\n\n40\n00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.290\nVery good, and one of the things\nthat I was thinking is that's a lot\n\n41\n00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.310\nlike another technology that we have.\n\n42\n00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.040\nAnd for instance if you are in PowerShell,\nthe integrating,\n\n43\n00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.830\nscripting environment, when you typed\nout a portion of your commandlet there,\n\n44\n00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.230\nthe IntelliSense feature helps you,\ngives you a list of the other option.\n\n45\n00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.010\nSo a lot of like that now,\none of the things I did see, Mike,\n\n46\n00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.000\nis that you still had to enter the\ninformation cell by cell, line by line.\n\n47\n00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.450\nLooks like it might get a little tedious.\n\n48\n00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.470\nNow what if you have a lot of information.\n\n49\n00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.850\nObviously we won't want carpel tunnel or\ntendonitis by doing data entry.\n\n50\n00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.920\nIs there a way to get that information\ninto that spreadsheet a little bit easier?\n\n51\n00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.780\n>> There is.\nIt really depends on what format you\n\n52\n00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.280\nget it in.\n\n53\n00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.836\nIf it's comes to you on a piece of paper,\nyou're probably stuck typing that data in.\n\n54\n00:02:37.836 --> 00:02:42.050\nBut if it's in some on electronic format,\nmay be we can just copy it and\n\n55\n00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.560\npaste it in there or\nappend it to our worksheet.\n\n56\n00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.318\nFor example,\nlet me open up a another spreadsheet here.\n\n57\n00:02:48.318 --> 00:02:50.779\nAnd you can see I've got\nsome similar data right?\n\n58\n00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:53.422\nThis is the month of April, I believe,\n\n59\n00:02:53.422 --> 00:02:59.110\ntheir sales I'm simply gonna select the\ndata that I want, and I'm gonna copy it.\n\n60\n00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.690\nI'll click Copy up there\non my home ribbon.\n\n61\n00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.085\nI'll jump back over to that other\nworkbook, select where I wanna paste it,\n\n62\n00:03:08.085 --> 00:03:12.720\nright-click, and paste that\ninformation in there and there we go.\n\n63\n00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.690\nI have just inserted in a few new rows\n\n64\n00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.940\nwithout having to type\nall that information in.\n\n65\n00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.349\nYou can also import data.\n\n66\n00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:21.778\nWe're going to save importing for\n\n67\n00:03:21.778 --> 00:03:24.150\nanother episode because\nthere's a little more detail.\n\n68\n00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.960\nWe have to worry about the format that\nit's coming in and what it's coming from\n\n69\n00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.520\nis going to make a difference on\nhow we go about importing that.\n\n70\n00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.210\nA lot of times we have multiple\nworksheets, we just need to combine\n\n71\n00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.980\nthe information, simply copy it from one\nworksheet and paste it to the other.\n\n72\n00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.360\nNow when you go and paste that information\nwe've got a couple of choices.\n\n73\n00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.410\nFor example, let me jump back\nover to this other workbook,\n\n74\n00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.880\nI'm gonna copy some more data.\n\n75\n00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.820\nI'm going to select all of this and\nright-click and Copy.\n\n76\n00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.900\nNow I'm going to go paste\nit into that first workbook\n\n77\n00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.060\nat the end of that worksheet.\n\n78\n00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.158\nWhen I paste it, if I just simply paste\nit, it's going to look awfully funny\n\n79\n00:04:04.158 --> 00:04:08.097\nbecause it keeps that source formatting,\nwhich had those blue and\n\n80\n00:04:08.097 --> 00:04:11.500\nwhite bars on there to make it\na little bit easier to read.\n\n81\n00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.230\nSo instead of simply pasting it in there,\n\n82\n00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.950\nwhat I need to do is be a little\nmore specific with my paste options.\n\n83\n00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.810\nThat's the standard paste, but\nwe have several paste options.\n\n84\n00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.552\nAnd then here you might, if you've\nnever looked at this you're like,\n\n85\n00:04:25.552 --> 00:04:28.080\nwait a second there's 15 different\nways I can paste things in.\n\n86\n00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.510\nWell not quite 15, but\nabout ten ways I can paste data.\n\n87\n00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.180\nOne of the ways is to paste values, right?\n\n88\n00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.840\nIf I paste values,\nit's gonna ignore the source formatting.\n\n89\n00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.797\nIt's just gonna paste the data itself,\nand that way it will pick up\n\n90\n00:04:42.797 --> 00:04:46.980\nwhatever formatting exists in\nthe worksheet that I'm pasting it to.\n\n91\n00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.882\nNow it's gonna look more like\nthe rest of my data, and\n\n92\n00:04:49.882 --> 00:04:54.203\nI don't have to try to undo or clear all\nof that formatting that came when I copied\n\n93\n00:04:54.203 --> 00:04:55.900\nit from that first worksheet.\n\n94\n00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.830\nSo play around with those options,\nsometimes you do wanna paste\n\n95\n00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.250\nthe formatting, so\nyou just do your normal paste.\n\n96\n00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.910\nOther times you just\nwanna paste that data and\n\n97\n00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.110\nyou can choose that in your paste options.\n\n98\n00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.720\n>> Great, so you saved us on\nour doctor's bill for sure.\n\n99\n00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.334\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n100\n00:05:09.334 --> 00:05:10.734\n>> Our risk will last a little bit longer.\n\n101\n00:05:10.734 --> 00:05:15.294\nNow, with that, being able to import that\ninformation, it does make it very handy.\n\n102\n00:05:15.294 --> 00:05:19.184\nDo we have any other features that might\nbe in Excel that'll help us add data\n\n103\n00:05:19.184 --> 00:05:21.630\nwithout going cell by cell, line by line?\n\n104\n00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.240\n>> There are.\nThere's one that I particularly like is\n\n105\n00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.160\nknown as the auto-fill.\n\n106\n00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.300\nAnd let me find another workbook\nthat we can play around with here.\n\n107\n00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.250\nI'm gonna jump over to the Summary tab.\n\n108\n00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.810\nAnd I've started a little data\narea where I'm gonna keep track of\n\n109\n00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.480\nthe different categories of\nanimals on a monthly basis.\n\n110\n00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.960\nI wanna look at the total sales.\n\n111\n00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.270\nAnd so I need to put out the names\nof my months across here.\n\n112\n00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.490\nAnd you can see I started.\n\n113\n00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.830\nI typed in January, February, March.\n\n114\n00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.920\nAnd I could keep going, but guess what?\n\n115\n00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.980\nExcel can do it for me.\n\n116\n00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.850\nWhen I select the cell March,\nyou can see that green bounding box.\n\n117\n00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:02.620\nIn the bottom right hand corner, there's a\nlittle green box, and if I hover over it,\n\n118\n00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.660\nmy cursor turns to a black crosshair.\n\n119\n00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.110\nIf I click and hold while I have\nthat cross hair I'm grabbing on,\n\n120\n00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.940\non that little box there.\n\n121\n00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.930\nNow as I drag if you can see the tool\ntip it's telling me that is gonna\n\n122\n00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.730\nfill in the rest of these months,\nand once I get to December,\n\n123\n00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:24.770\nI simply let go my mouse and\nfills it all for me.\n\n124\n00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.179\nSo I didn't have to go about\ntyping that information in.\n\n125\n00:06:27.179 --> 00:06:32.849\nIt's fantastic and Excel is pretty smart,\nit can pick up certain, there's words\n\n126\n00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:37.720\nthat it can pick up and it can detect\nthe pattern on it as well as numbers.\n\n127\n00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.620\nAnd let's grab another worksheet,\nI'll show you a couple of examples.\n\n128\n00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.327\nYou saw with months,\nI could do that, what if I did just,\n\n129\n00:06:45.327 --> 00:06:49.038\nif I wanna do the abbreviation\ninstead of the full month,\n\n130\n00:06:49.038 --> 00:06:53.120\nit'll recognize that as\nwell by drag that on over.\n\n131\n00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.880\nWe can see it does,\njust that three letter abbreviation and\n\n132\n00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:02.020\nit will work vertically as well as\nhorizontally so, I go either way.\n\n133\n00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.730\nIf I do the day of the week,\nlet's put in here Sunday, right.\n\n134\n00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:09.859\nWell, if I do a series fill on that.\n\n135\n00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.370\nYou see it picks it up,\nSunday through Saturday,\n\n136\n00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:18.620\nand if I go further than Saturday\nit simply starts over and\n\n137\n00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.530\ncontinues on with Sunday,\nMonday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.\n\n138\n00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:26.200\nSo do the days of the week, it just has\nto be something that Excel recognizes.\n\n139\n00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:30.112\nLike if I do Snickers,\neverybody's favorite candy bar,\n\n140\n00:07:30.112 --> 00:07:35.040\nall right if I try to do a series\nfill I'm gonna get Butterfinger,\n\n141\n00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.100\nand Milky Way and things like that right?\n\n142\n00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:42.755\nIt doesn't recognize that, so it has\nto be something that Excel understands.\n\n143\n00:07:42.755 --> 00:07:44.225\nBut it's pretty bright.\n\n144\n00:07:44.225 --> 00:07:45.461\nWhat if I put QTR.\n\n145\n00:07:45.461 --> 00:07:47.337\nOops if I could type here.\n\n146\n00:07:47.337 --> 00:07:50.087\nQTR1.\n\n147\n00:07:50.087 --> 00:07:52.380\nWell if I grab that and drag it.\n\n148\n00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:59.330\nIt's going to see that its talking about\nquarters and its goes quarter 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n149\n00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:02.895\nIt knows there is only four quarters,\nso it doesn't go quarter 5.\n\n150\n00:08:02.895 --> 00:08:04.900\nIt starts over with quarter 1.\n\n151\n00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.420\n>> Now what if I'm, I'm thinking,\nwhat if I'm a bookie?\n\n152\n00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.080\nAnd I'm going to be dealing\nwith a lot of numbers here.\n\n153\n00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.170\nCould it do the same thing?\n\n154\n00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:13.450\nIs it intelligent enough to do\nthe same thing across those cells with\n\n155\n00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:14.020\nnumbers as well?\n\n156\n00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.670\n>> It does work pretty good with numbers.\n\n157\n00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:17.790\nYou have to do it just\na little bit differently,\n\n158\n00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:22.730\nbecause if I type in one number, and\nI try to do a series fill, well,\n\n159\n00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:25.300\nit's just gonna end up copying that down,\nright?\n\n160\n00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.840\nBecause it says all right, the number 10,\nyou wanna do that several times?\n\n161\n00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.440\nFine, I can do that.\n\n162\n00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:34.520\nThe trick with numbers is to\nselect more than one cell\n\n163\n00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.580\nwhen you're doing a series fill.\n\n164\n00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.510\nAnd what it'll do is it'll\nlook at the increment,\n\n165\n00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:42.480\nthe difference between the numbers,\nand it will repeat that increment.\n\n166\n00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:48.800\nSo if I do 1 and 2, grab both of those\ncells, so highlight both of them.\n\n167\n00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.010\nNow grab that series fill and\ndrag it down,\n\n168\n00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:54.850\nyou'll see that it will end\nup incrementing that number.\n\n169\n00:08:54.850 --> 00:09:00.470\nAnd if I do a different increment, if I\ndo 5 and 10, well it'll figure that out.\n\n170\n00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:04.930\nIt'll go okay, you wanna count by fives,\nI can do that for you as well.\n\n171\n00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:06.200\nIt'll also go backwards.\n\n172\n00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.780\nIf we do 100 and 95,\n\n173\n00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:14.720\nthen we can grab both of those cells so\nthey can see the difference\n\n174\n00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.040\nbetween the two numbers, and\nit'll take care of that for me as well.\n\n175\n00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:22.470\nIt'll go negatives, and\nthese will all work horizontally as well.\n\n176\n00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:27.700\nIf I was gonna put,\nlet's see, 90 here, I can\n\n177\n00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:32.760\nsimply grab both of those cells, so that\nit can see the difference between the two.\n\n178\n00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:37.190\nAnd as I go,\nit'll keep that same increment.\n\n179\n00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:41.040\nNow, there might be times when you\ndo wanna copy those numbers and\n\n180\n00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.290\nyou don't want it to do a series fill.\n\n181\n00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:45.369\nLet me clean this up\njust a little bit here.\n\n182\n00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:47.340\nAll right?\n\n183\n00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.620\nLet's say I've got some numbers like 10,\n5,\n\n184\n00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.940\nbut I just wanted to, and\nlet's do a couple more here.\n\n185\n00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.490\nWe'll do 15, something like that.\n\n186\n00:09:55.490 --> 00:10:00.300\nI don't want it to do a series fill,\nI need to repeat those numbers.\n\n187\n00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.710\nIf I drag down it's gonna\nsee that difference, and\n\n188\n00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:05.890\nit's gonna increment it as it goes.\n\n189\n00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:08.590\nI can simply click on\nthe tooltip that pops up and\n\n190\n00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:13.790\nchoose copy cells instead and\nnow it will copy those cells.\n\n191\n00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:19.019\nThe same thing with text like\nif I was doing January, and\n\n192\n00:10:19.019 --> 00:10:22.916\nfor some reason I needed\nthe word January several times,\n\n193\n00:10:22.916 --> 00:10:27.450\nwell if I do a series fill it's\ngonna try to do each month for me.\n\n194\n00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:32.230\nI change that over to copy, and now it's\njust gonna simply copy those cells, so\n\n195\n00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.090\nit's a pretty smart feature.\n\n196\n00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:36.460\nDefinitely something you\nshould take advantage of.\n\n197\n00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:40.810\nIt's a big time saver, typically when\nyou're first setting up that spreadsheet.\n\n198\n00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:43.330\nNow I've gotta put all\nthe months across the top.\n\n199\n00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:44.700\nIt works with dates.\n\n200\n00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:51.810\nFor example, if we wanted to do 1/1/2015.\n\n201\n00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:58.310\nI can go and grab that and drag it down,\nand it'll start filling in those dates.\n\n202\n00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:03.720\nAnd it's smart enough to know that\nthere's 31 days in January so\n\n203\n00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.640\nat the end of that,\nit starts out with February.\n\n204\n00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:12.570\nAnd it knows February only has 28 days\nthis year, so it goes into March.\n\n205\n00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:15.830\nAnd it'll follow whatever\nformat you choose to use.\n\n206\n00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:19.030\nIf you were doing a shorter\nversion date like 1/1/15,\n\n207\n00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:23.470\nin this case it wants to change\nit because of my format up here.\n\n208\n00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:26.830\nBut if we did,\nlet's change that to a long date, right?\n\n209\n00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:28.230\nI can do the long date as well.\n\n210\n00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.610\nAll right, we'll make that\na little wider so we can see that.\n\n211\n00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:37.800\nSo that can be a huge time saver when\nyou're setting up these worksheets.\n\n212\n00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.560\nTake advantage of that series autofill.\n\n213\n00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.390\nAnd as I said, it works across columns.\n\n214\n00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:49.218\nThe only thing you want to keep in mind\nis, if there's no detectable pattern,\n\n215\n00:11:49.218 --> 00:11:53.986\nlike 22, 16, 22, well, it's not\ngoing to know what to do with that.\n\n216\n00:11:53.986 --> 00:11:57.370\nSo you're gonna get kind\nof some strange results.\n\n217\n00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:02.460\nIn this case, it just copied the number\n20, not sure how it figured that out.\n\n218\n00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:03.864\nLet's do with some of this other ones.\n\n219\n00:12:03.864 --> 00:12:07.418\nWe'll end up getting some fractions\nof numbers because it sees\n\n220\n00:12:07.418 --> 00:12:12.660\nthat this one didn't have any increment,\nand this one incremented down by one.\n\n221\n00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.170\nIt just can't figure out what to do.\n\n222\n00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:19.190\nSo if there's no detectable pattern,\nExcel tries to do the best that it can.\n\n223\n00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:22.200\nAnd again, if you just wanna\ncopy the data, just go ahead and\n\n224\n00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:27.560\ndo your series fill, and then change\nit to copy and you're good to go.\n\n225\n00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.420\nSo you can really fill\nout some information fast\n\n226\n00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:32.470\ntaking advantage of that series autofill.\n\n227\n00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:33.870\n>> That's great, good things.\n\n228\n00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:36.734\nNow, I have to be honest with you Mike\nthis looks like a worksheet that I\n\n229\n00:12:36.734 --> 00:12:39.110\nmight have done because it\nlooks kinda bland, right?\n\n230\n00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:42.610\nYou don't want me doing any\nspreadsheets for you at all.\n\n231\n00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:45.130\nSo one of the things that I\nwanted to do in the past,\n\n232\n00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:47.190\nmaybe I wanna name the worksheet inside.\n\n233\n00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:48.820\nOr I keep say worksheet, spreadsheet.\n\n234\n00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.290\nI wanna name it inside, right?\n\n235\n00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:52.500\nWell is there a way that\nyou can bring that out?\n\n236\n00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:56.730\nMake that one cell stand out a little\nbit better, make it easier, and\n\n237\n00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:59.600\nmaybe so it's not just the defaults.\n\n238\n00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.130\n>> Absolutely.\n\n239\n00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:03.790\nLet me find another worksheet\nhere I think that I started up.\n\n240\n00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:04.770\nWhere did it go?\n\n241\n00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:08.590\nTake a look at sales.\n\n242\n00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:10.650\nAnd let's look at sales 2015.\n\n243\n00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:11.511\nHere we go.\n\n244\n00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.570\nI think this one will work for us.\n\n245\n00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:17.690\nWell, we'll just go back into\nthis one that we're using here.\n\n246\n00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:21.630\nYeah, for example, you might want to put,\nwhat is this information,\n\n247\n00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:22.990\nwhat does it represent.\n\n248\n00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:25.600\nLet's say it's monthly sales.\n\n249\n00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:30.410\nSo I can come up here and\nI can type in Monthly Sales.\n\n250\n00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:33.690\nAnd we'll increase that file.\n\n251\n00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:36.500\nLooks like it already did a good\njob of increasing it for me.\n\n252\n00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:40.510\nWe'll bump that up to 20 make\nthat row a little bit taller.\n\n253\n00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:44.230\nBut what you'll notice, and\na couple of things we need to understand\n\n254\n00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:48.740\nthe way Excel works with numbers and\nthe way Excel works with text.\n\n255\n00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:49.270\nAll right.\n\n256\n00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:52.150\nWhen you type in text as you can see,\n\n257\n00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:54.410\nwell we'll do it down here so\nyou can see it a little bit better.\n\n258\n00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:57.620\nI put in Monthly Sales.\n\n259\n00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.820\nWell, or Monthly Sales Figures.\n\n260\n00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:01.965\nHow about that.\n\n261\n00:14:01.965 --> 00:14:06.330\nYou notice that text\ndoesn't fit in this cell.\n\n262\n00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:06.970\nRight.\n\n263\n00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:10.560\nBut Excel says well there's\nnothing in the cell next to it.\n\n264\n00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.470\nSo I'm go ahead and show that information.\n\n265\n00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:16.420\nI can just let it flow right out of\nthat cell and on into the next one.\n\n266\n00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.850\nNow, technically it's not\nin the next cell, right?\n\n267\n00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:21.040\nThe next cell is still blank.\n\n268\n00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:24.640\nAll that data exist in\nthis cell right here.\n\n269\n00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:29.670\nIf I go and type in something into\nthis cell, well now, I can no longer\n\n270\n00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:34.360\nlet this one overlap into the next one,\ncuz it'll cover this one up, right?\n\n271\n00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:39.350\nSo, as long as there's nothing next to it,\nit will let it overlap the cell.\n\n272\n00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:43.670\nBut as soon as something is\ninserted into the next cell,\n\n273\n00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:46.760\nit can't do that any more and\nit will chop it off.\n\n274\n00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:52.410\nIf you need this to show up,\nyou could make this column wider, but\n\n275\n00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:55.950\nthat might goof up the rest of\nthe way your spreadsheet works out.\n\n276\n00:14:55.950 --> 00:15:00.490\nSo you don't want to change the width\nof that column just to support this.\n\n277\n00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:03.290\nSo what you could do is\nwrap the text instead.\n\n278\n00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.360\nIt's kinda like a word processor\nwhere if it won't fit,\n\n279\n00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:12.020\nyou get to the end of the line, it just\ndoes an automatic carriage return and\n\n280\n00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:13.350\nmoves down to the next line.\n\n281\n00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:16.950\nSo notice now it does fit\nin that column width.\n\n282\n00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:19.010\nIt just takes up a little more height.\n\n283\n00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:20.980\nIt made that row a little taller.\n\n284\n00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.790\nTo wrap that information over there,\nall right?\n\n285\n00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:25.490\nSo that's the way it deals with text.\n\n286\n00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:29.230\nIt'll let it flow into over the next\ncell unless there's something there,\n\n287\n00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:32.330\nand then it'll just chop it off,\nall right?\n\n288\n00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:37.250\nWith numbers, and text, by the way,\nis left aligned by default.\n\n289\n00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:40.500\nI'm gonna go back to this point here,\nall right?\n\n290\n00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:41.660\nAs we type in text.\n\n291\n00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:48.547\nLet's see, Hello World, all right,\nnotice it's all left aligned.\n\n292\n00:15:48.547 --> 00:15:53.171\nIn other words, it's bumped up over\nto the left side of that cell.\n\n293\n00:15:53.171 --> 00:15:56.962\nNumbers are going to be\nright aligned by default.\n\n294\n00:15:56.962 --> 00:15:57.629\nAll right.\n\n295\n00:15:57.629 --> 00:16:02.100\nSo as I type in numbers here notice they\nall jump to the right side of the cell.\n\n296\n00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:09.510\nNow if you have a number that doesn't fit\nin a cell, notice it does not overlap it.\n\n297\n00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:12.490\nIt will not let it flow out.\n\n298\n00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:16.760\nIt actually changes it to\nthis scientific notation.\n\n299\n00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:21.520\nExcel will not let numbers lay\nover onto other cells, and\n\n300\n00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:25.630\nit won't simply chop it off and\nnot show you the rest of the number,\n\n301\n00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:28.400\nbecause we can get ourselves\nin trouble with that.\n\n302\n00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.570\nWhat if you had a column that was\nshowing how much the customer owed, and\n\n303\n00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:37.580\nthey owed you a $100,000, but\nit didn't fit, so it just chopped off\n\n304\n00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:42.550\nthe last couple of zeroes, and\nnow they only owed you a $1,000.\n\n305\n00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:47.200\nIt's not gonna take that chance and\nhide numbers from you.\n\n306\n00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.010\nSo it will change the notation\nof that scientific notation.\n\n307\n00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:52.250\nNotice the scientific\nnotation wouldn't even fit,\n\n308\n00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:54.720\nand it forced the column to get wider.\n\n309\n00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.590\nIf I start dragging this in and\nsaying, no,\n\n310\n00:16:56.590 --> 00:17:00.250\nExcel, I don't want you to make that\ncolumn wider, it changes my notation.\n\n311\n00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:03.010\nIt drops down the number of\ndecimals it's showing me.\n\n312\n00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:05.730\nBut it's still representing\nthe entire number,\n\n313\n00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:08.230\nit's using that scientific notation.\n\n314\n00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:12.260\nSo its left a line by default for\ntext, and\n\n315\n00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.830\nit won't let it overlap into another cell.\n\n316\n00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:20.470\nNow if we want to, let's go back up and\nlook at what Wes was\n\n317\n00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:25.370\ntalking about earlier, and we've got the\ntitle for this little area of my chart.\n\n318\n00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:26.180\nAnd I was trying to find.\n\n319\n00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:29.270\nI had another one that\nmight look even better.\n\n320\n00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:30.710\nLet's see what I did with that.\n\n321\n00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:35.430\nThat was,well,\nthis one we'll make this one work here.\n\n322\n00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:40.050\nWe can try type this in, but,\n\n323\n00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:42.780\nagain, it's going to overlap\nover these next cells, and\n\n324\n00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:47.490\neverything gets put into these cells is\nall of the sudden gonna get chopped off.\n\n325\n00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:52.690\nSo what I can do instead is I\ncan merge some cells together.\n\n326\n00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:55.040\nWe can combine cells into one and\n\n327\n00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:59.060\nthen center the data within\nthat combination of cells.\n\n328\n00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:03.380\nFor example, what if I just take this\nwhole thing here all the way from\n\n329\n00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:07.860\nend to end of my data set and\nthen I can choose merge and center.\n\n330\n00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:11.580\nNow this is one big cell.\n\n331\n00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:17.690\nYou can see this whole thing is one cell\nand the text is centered within there.\n\n332\n00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:22.560\nAnd no matter how, if I change\nthese column widths inside here,\n\n333\n00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:28.250\nit's not going to affect, and I just\ncompletely hid December or November there.\n\n334\n00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:29.030\nLet me bring that back.\n\n335\n00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:33.540\nAll right, oh, little missed click.\n\n336\n00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:35.560\nSorry, just do an unhide there.\n\n337\n00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:40.515\nAnd so as I move these things around,\nthat monthly sales is going to stay\n\n338\n00:18:40.515 --> 00:18:45.420\ncentered over that area,\nthat merge section.\n\n339\n00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:50.080\nIf I change my mind, I can click merge and\ncenter again, it'll undo that and\n\n340\n00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.480\nput it back into a single cell.\n\n341\n00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.940\nI love that merge and center, I've seen\na lot of people try to do something like\n\n342\n00:18:55.940 --> 00:19:00.670\nthis, put spaces out in front of their\n\n343\n00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:05.220\ntext to try to get it to be centered over\nwhat they're trying to center it over.\n\n344\n00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:06.420\nDon't do that.\n\n345\n00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:08.440\nDon't use these extra spaces here.\n\n346\n00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.150\nThat's a little clunky.\n\n347\n00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:14.840\nWhat you really want to do is just grab\nthose cells and then do a merge and\n\n348\n00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:19.290\ncenter, that way it is gonna remain\ncenter no matter what else happens.\n\n349\n00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:25.170\nAs far as other things we can do to\nmake this pretty, we can change fonts.\n\n350\n00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:29.840\nLike let's say the months don't really\nstand out from the rest of my data.\n\n351\n00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.580\nSo maybe we wanna make\nthese a little bit bigger.\n\n352\n00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:38.170\nWe'll change that, we'll give it a 14 and\nmaybe we'll make it bold.\n\n353\n00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:38.680\nI like that.\n\n354\n00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.860\nAll right.\n\n355\n00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:41.550\nSo, now, it really stands out.\n\n356\n00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:43.560\nBut what about the rest of my months?\n\n357\n00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:46.650\nNow, I have to go and do those as well.\n\n358\n00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:49.780\nNo, we've got something\nknown as the Format Painter.\n\n359\n00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:53.210\nThat's this little paintbrush\nin the Clipboard area.\n\n360\n00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:56.620\nSelect the cell that you\nlike the formatting of,\n\n361\n00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:59.450\nclick on the format painter, and\n\n362\n00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:02.650\nthen click the cell you want to copy\nthat formatting to, and there you go.\n\n363\n00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:06.430\nNow that one is exactly the same,\nand I didn't have to do any work.\n\n364\n00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:10.070\nYou could also click and\ndrag if you wanted to do more than one.\n\n365\n00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:15.110\nI'm gonna select the cell that I like,\nclick my format painter brush, and\n\n366\n00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:20.170\nthen click and\ndrag across the rest of them.\n\n367\n00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:24.500\nAnd now, we've got all of our\nmonth's stand out a little bit.\n\n368\n00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:25.830\nWe saw this the other day,\n\n369\n00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:31.072\nif I wanna make those columns fit\na little better, we can do that autofit.\n\n370\n00:20:31.072 --> 00:20:32.196\nOof.\n\n371\n00:20:32.196 --> 00:20:34.360\nOh, and\nit was because of my text down here.\n\n372\n00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.400\nLet's get rid of that there and\ntry that one more time.\n\n373\n00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:38.670\nWe can do our auto fit.\n\n374\n00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:44.710\nBut now you see those little months have\nlittle columns, the bigger the month they\n\n375\n00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:49.950\nnames are a little bit longer, so\nit depends on what you're trying to do.\n\n376\n00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:51.540\nLet's set that a little bit better.\n\n377\n00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:56.860\nLet's just change all of those guys\nat once to something around 12,\n\n378\n00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:01.590\nand now we should look\na little bit better.\n\n379\n00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.320\nStill just a wee big.\n\n380\n00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:07.240\nLet's drop that down just a hair.\n\n381\n00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.220\nSorry, I get a little OCD with this.\n\n382\n00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:13.800\nWe're going to change that column width\none more time to something like ten.\n\n383\n00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.480\nAnd we'll see how that\nfits a little bit better.\n\n384\n00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:19.990\nAll right, now that Format Painter,\n\n385\n00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:23.560\nyou notice when I used it if I\nclick once on the cell that I like,\n\n386\n00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:28.150\nI click the Format Painter, I get a little\nbrush attached to my cursor there.\n\n387\n00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:33.350\nAnd now if I apply that\nformatting somewhere, if I click,\n\n388\n00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:35.080\nthe brush goes away.\n\n389\n00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.710\nIf you need that brush to stay so\nthat you can do more than one place\n\n390\n00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:43.410\nyou can select the format you like,\ndouble click on the Format Painter.\n\n391\n00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:48.230\nI still get the brush icon but\nnow I can click on the cell here.\n\n392\n00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:51.304\nI can go and drag down these guys,\nI can click on this cell here,\n\n393\n00:21:51.304 --> 00:21:53.520\nnotice the brush is not going away.\n\n394\n00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:56.940\nUntil I click the Format Painter again,\nthat brush will remain.\n\n395\n00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:02.620\nSo if you need to apply formatting, but\nthe cells aren't right next to each other\n\n396\n00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:06.500\nso you can't simply just click and drag,\njust double-click on that Format Painter.\n\n397\n00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.000\nAnd it kinda locks it in the on position.\n\n398\n00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.150\nIt's like doing a caps lock for\nthe format painter.\n\n399\n00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:16.640\nNow everything you click on,\nthat formatting will be applied.\n\n400\n00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.580\nNow other things we can do,\n\n401\n00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:22.320\nwe can adjust the alignment\nof the text within the cells.\n\n402\n00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:26.160\nI said that numbers are left aligned,\nand you can see these numbers here\n\n403\n00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:29.690\nare all over there on the left\nhand side of the column.\n\n404\n00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:32.630\nWell I wanna center them.\n\n405\n00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:33.940\nLet's make it look a little bit better.\n\n406\n00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:38.600\nI'm just gonna select all those\nnumbers and then click center.\n\n407\n00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.200\nAnd now it looks a little bit better.\n\n408\n00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.510\nMaybe I wanna do the titles,\n\n409\n00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:46.520\nthat looks like they might benefit\nfrom some center alignment.\n\n410\n00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:47.590\nAll right.\nThere we go.\n\n411\n00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:50.180\nNow, we're starting to\nlook a little bit better.\n\n412\n00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:53.540\nNow, this needs to be bold and\nmaybe even underline.\n\n413\n00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:54.170\nLet's do that.\n\n414\n00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:57.310\nOh now we're starting to\nlook a little bit better.\n\n415\n00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:58.880\nThis is something more like\nyou're expecting, Wes?\n\n416\n00:22:58.880 --> 00:22:59.820\n>> Yeah, a little bit better.\n\n417\n00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:02.950\nIt doesn't look quite as plain as\nmine would be, I can tell you.\n\n418\n00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:08.245\nNow, what if there's maybe a cell that I\nwanna maybe stand out a little bit more,\n\n419\n00:23:08.245 --> 00:23:09.915\na lot of information inside of there.\n\n420\n00:23:09.915 --> 00:23:13.225\nIs there a way we can do that rather than\nhaving to break out the magnifying glass\n\n421\n00:23:13.225 --> 00:23:14.465\nor increase the font size?\n\n422\n00:23:14.465 --> 00:23:17.655\n>> Absolutely,\nwe can do some cell styles and\n\n423\n00:23:17.655 --> 00:23:20.805\nthey give us the ability\nto really add some pizazz.\n\n424\n00:23:20.805 --> 00:23:23.915\nLike if we find a number like these zeros,\nthat's no good.\n\n425\n00:23:23.915 --> 00:23:25.605\nI don't like those.\n\n426\n00:23:25.605 --> 00:23:28.315\nWell let's find out how\nwe can mark those up.\n\n427\n00:23:28.315 --> 00:23:31.820\nUp here on my home ribbon I've\ngot my cell styles, and ooh,\n\n428\n00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:33.230\nthere's one right there called Bad.\n\n429\n00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:34.560\nI like that.\n\n430\n00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:37.860\nNotice it's going to change\nthe background color and the font color.\n\n431\n00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:42.648\nSo now I can apply that to wherever\nI have zeroes, I can go and\n\n432\n00:23:42.648 --> 00:23:44.088\napply that cell style.\n\n433\n00:23:44.088 --> 00:23:48.490\nSo cell styles are ways that we can\nadd a little bit of highlighting.\n\n434\n00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:53.253\nAnd unfortunately in Excel,\nthere is no easy highlight option.\n\n435\n00:23:53.253 --> 00:23:54.045\nRight?\n\n436\n00:23:54.045 --> 00:23:55.805\nWhen you think of Word for example,\n\n437\n00:23:55.805 --> 00:24:00.210\nyou get a button on your toolbar that will\nlet you apply that highlighting, right?\n\n438\n00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:03.390\nJust like we used to use the highlighters\nwhen we were marking up text,\n\n439\n00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:05.750\nthat's just to bring\nattention to something?\n\n440\n00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:07.910\nIn Excel, I can't really do that.\n\n441\n00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:12.780\nThe way we do it, is we fake it by\nchanging the background color of the cell.\n\n442\n00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:15.758\nSo 22, that's a really good number.\n\n443\n00:24:15.758 --> 00:24:18.740\nMaybe you want to highlight that,\nbut to highlight it,\n\n444\n00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:21.800\nI just changed the fill color of the cell.\n\n445\n00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:22.330\nRight?\n\n446\n00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:24.240\nTo make that stand out a little bit more.\n\n447\n00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:28.670\nSo, there really isn't a highlighter\ntool built into Excel, but\n\n448\n00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:33.600\nI can kind of fake it, by changing\nthe background color of those cell.\n\n449\n00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.400\nSo the only thing that\nyou have to do there,\n\n450\n00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.550\nis make sure that the font still shows up.\n\n451\n00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:40.360\nYou might want to change\nthe font color depending on that\n\n452\n00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:41.920\nfill color that you choose.\n\n453\n00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:46.950\nIf I go a little bit lighter on the green,\nnow that 22 is still visible there,\n\n454\n00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:49.550\nstill stands out.\n\n455\n00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:52.860\nOther things we have to worry\nabout is number formats, and\n\n456\n00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:55.880\nthere's several number\nformats that we can apply.\n\n457\n00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:59.900\nLet's see where I can\nshow you an example here.\n\n458\n00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:01.050\nRight here's a good example.\n\n459\n00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:06.010\nOn my March tab, I imported some data, and\nwhen I imported it, these are my amounts.\n\n460\n00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:07.150\nWell, these are dollar values,\n\n461\n00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:11.860\nbut that's not really obvious from the way\nthose numbers look right there, all right?\n\n462\n00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:14.100\nSo, we need to format this.\n\n463\n00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:17.690\nThe format I would choose\nwould be Currency.\n\n464\n00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:22.580\nCurrency is gonna throw that dollar sign\nout there, and give me two decimal points.\n\n465\n00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:27.320\nSo if I do this like this number here,\nwe go down and we apply Currency, and\n\n466\n00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.490\nnow it looks a little bit\nmore like dollars, all right.\n\n467\n00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:32.450\nNow you can do it one cell at a time.\n\n468\n00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:37.730\nYou can use your format painter and try to\nformat the rest of these guys like that.\n\n469\n00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:43.830\nAn easier way to apply a formatting to the\nentire column, select the column right.\n\n470\n00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:47.450\nAnd then change that to currency and\nwe're good to go.\n\n471\n00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:51.310\nAnother number format that we commonly\nhave to use is the date format.\n\n472\n00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:55.430\nAgain, this data was imported, so\nit doesn't look much like a date.\n\n473\n00:25:55.430 --> 00:26:00.090\nNow I go and change that to a short date,\nand there we go.\n\n474\n00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:02.680\nNow we're a little more in business.\n\n475\n00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:03.510\nAll right?\n\n476\n00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:06.640\nA couple other things\nthat we should try out.\n\n477\n00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:10.030\nWe did our Format Painter,\nwe talked about merging cells.\n\n478\n00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:13.690\nThe alignment again, you can do\nleft align, right align, centered.\n\n479\n00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:17.910\nYou can also align it\nvertically within the cell.\n\n480\n00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:20.650\nAll right, let me go back\nout to our summary here, and\n\n481\n00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:26.340\nI'm gonna make this a little bit taller.\n\n482\n00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:29.880\nSo, I've got all in this, ridiculously\ntall, let's do something like that.\n\n483\n00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:33.660\nAnd all these extra space,\nI could take these guys and\n\n484\n00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:39.170\nright above my left center and right\nalign, is my top, middle, and bottom line.\n\n485\n00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:41.580\nYou see text by default is bottom align,\nso\n\n486\n00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:44.260\nis numbers,\nmaybe I wanna center that in that column.\n\n487\n00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:46.760\nYou see how they jumped in\nthe middle of the cell?\n\n488\n00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.770\nSo depending on what you're trying to do,\nand I'll go ahead and\n\n489\n00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:51.490\ndo that whole block of data there,\n\n490\n00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:56.020\nwe'll go ahead and center line those, so\nI can move them up to the top of the cell.\n\n491\n00:26:56.020 --> 00:27:00.250\nIt really just depends on what you're\ntrying to do, but that doesn't make it.\n\n492\n00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:03.100\nMaybe stand out a little bit more from it.\n\n493\n00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:07.790\nAnother thing that we sometimes want\nto do, is put a little space before it.\n\n494\n00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:11.470\nLike text is always left\naligned by default.\n\n495\n00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:15.580\nBut what if I have, I don't know,\nsome other data over here.\n\n496\n00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:16.990\nLet's put some numbers over there.\n\n497\n00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:22.010\nAll right, because numbers by default, or\n\n498\n00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:26.060\nwrite aligned, they bump right up\nagainst my text over here, and\n\n499\n00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:28.610\nmaybe that makes it too hard to read.\n\n500\n00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:32.230\nWell, what I could do,\nis increase the indent within the cell.\n\n501\n00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:36.940\nPut a little bit of a buffer between\nthe beginning of the cell and\n\n502\n00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:38.380\nthe text that's in there.\n\n503\n00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:42.910\nGive it a way to stand out from\nthat data that exists next to it.\n\n504\n00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:44.060\nAll right?\n\n505\n00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:49.750\nSo a lot of cool things I can do with\nthe text and with my numbers within Excel.\n\n506\n00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:54.150\nWorking with the alignment,\nworking with the font size and\n\n507\n00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:58.090\nthe font colors,\ndoing a little bit of highlighting.\n\n508\n00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:02.890\nThere's one more, Wes, that I don't\nfind myself using all that often, but\n\n509\n00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:07.370\nit all depends on what you're\ntrying to do with your spreadsheet.\n\n510\n00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:12.970\nSome people really, really like it and\nsome people hate it, and\n\n511\n00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:15.470\nits called Word Art.\n\n512\n00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:20.635\nWord Art It's gonna create art out of\nyour words, hence the name Word Art.\n\n513\n00:28:20.635 --> 00:28:23.145\nHa-ha it's it's interesting\nlet's take a look at it,\n\n514\n00:28:23.145 --> 00:28:26.740\nI'll let you decide if you're gonna\nfind it useful in your spreadsheets.\n\n515\n00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:32.960\nSo, word art on my insert menu\nover here underneath text.\n\n516\n00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:38.470\nI have Word Art, and when I click on that\nand you have got some pretty cool options,\n\n517\n00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:40.890\nand I'll give excel this there\nis some really neat ones.\n\n518\n00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:44.790\nOne of my favorite ones is\nthis mirrored look here.\n\n519\n00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:47.360\nI'm gonna select that one and\n\n520\n00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.810\nit's going to give me the ability\nto type my text here.\n\n521\n00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:53.770\nI'll put Mikes, and I'll move\nthis in just a second, Pet Store.\n\n522\n00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:59.100\nRight, and\nI'll show you what we can do to that.\n\n523\n00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:03.700\nLet me insert a few blank\nrows up here at the top, and\n\n524\n00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:08.342\nnow move that Word Art up there\nwere you can really see it.\n\n525\n00:29:08.342 --> 00:29:09.335\nRight?\n\n526\n00:29:09.335 --> 00:29:12.835\nAnd so there you can see it,\nit's text but it's not text.\n\n527\n00:29:12.835 --> 00:29:13.355\nRight?\n\n528\n00:29:13.355 --> 00:29:19.215\nIt's actually turned into an object that\nI can move around on my spread sheet.\n\n529\n00:29:19.215 --> 00:29:21.325\nSo I could put this anywhere I wanted.\n\n530\n00:29:21.325 --> 00:29:24.315\nIn fact,\nI can even rotate it if I want to, and\n\n531\n00:29:24.315 --> 00:29:26.715\nyou can see it's got that mirrored effect.\n\n532\n00:29:26.715 --> 00:29:30.095\nSo the mirrored effect probably\ndoesn't look to good rotated but\n\n533\n00:29:30.095 --> 00:29:35.010\nthere's several different\nStyles that we can use.\n\n534\n00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:36.920\nBut if I'm printing this out,\n\n535\n00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:40.870\nmaybe I want some kind of really\ncool font like that up there.\n\n536\n00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.920\nIf we got to a print preview on this guy.\n\n537\n00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.680\nLet's do a view.\nActually let's do file and\n\n538\n00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:52.350\nprint that will be\nthe easiest way to see it.\n\n539\n00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:56.450\nAll right.\n\n540\n00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:58.080\nAnd there you go,\nwe get something like that.\n\n541\n00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:02.710\nAnd it looks pretty good, right?\n\n542\n00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:03.960\nIf I'm gonna Print this up, or\n\n543\n00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:09.000\npresent it at a meeting, that adds\nsome real character to the report,\n\n544\n00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.520\nit draws attention to it, it lets\npeople know you spent some time on it.\n\n545\n00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:16.910\nOr maybe it's drawing away from the fact\nthat you don't have very good numbers, so\n\n546\n00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:18.690\nyou, you want them to focus on the title.\n\n547\n00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:19.242\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n548\n00:30:19.242 --> 00:30:20.000\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n549\n00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.090\n>> So Word Art is something you can\n\n550\n00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:23.700\nplay with.\n\n551\n00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:28.900\nAgain, it's just taking text and\nturning it into a graphical object\n\n552\n00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:31.880\nthat we can manipulate and\nput anywhere we want on that worksheet.\n\n553\n00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:35.410\nSo lots of things we can do to\nspice up these work sheets.\n\n554\n00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:36.350\n>> That's great Mike.\n\n555\n00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:38.890\nSo we've looked at a lot\nof cool features here.\n\n556\n00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:42.400\nWe've looked at how you can get\nthat data into your spreadsheet.\n\n557\n00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:43.850\nAuto fill.\n\n558\n00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:46.220\nBeing able to import the information in so\n\n559\n00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:49.180\nyou don't have to type out\ncell by cell line by line but.\n\n560\n00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:51.130\nWhat happens when the data\nis on your spreadsheet?\n\n561\n00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:52.300\nWhat can we do with it after then?\n\n562\n00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:56.580\nWe've showed you how to add some flair\nmake your spreadsheet a little bit more\n\n563\n00:30:56.580 --> 00:31:00.170\npresentable, so that if you are presenting\nit, it looks a little bit better.\n\n564\n00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:03.720\nAgain give it a little bit more flair\nthere Mike anything else for us?\n\n565\n00:31:03.720 -->

They show that understanding the basics of grouping and sorting results in reporting exactly what is asked of us.  They remind us that though formulas and details are foundations of the results we need, grouping and sorting helps to present that data in the way that is expected.  They guys demonstrate the use of conditional formatting, transposing put the data into perspective.  Using the sparklines, outlines and subtotals show that we command of presenting the data as requested.  These are great skills that anyone proficient in Excel should know how to accomplish.",

00:00:17.243\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.243 --> 00:00:20.915\ntoday, we're gonna be taking\na look into Microsoft Excel 2016,\n\n5\n00:00:20.915 --> 00:00:25.490\nand we're specifically gonna be talking\nabout grouping and sorting our data.\n\n6\n00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.140\nMaking sure that we understand\nthat our data on a spreadsheet\n\n7\n00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.520\ndoesn't always just have to appear as it\nis, but we can actually end up being able\n\n8\n00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.400\nto logically group the data together, so\nthat we can do the things that we need to.\n\n9\n00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.710\nAnd who better to help us,\nthan Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.880\nMike, how's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.050\n>> It's another day in paradise.\n\n12\n00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.030\nHere I am, working at ITProTV.\n\n13\n00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.120\nWorking with Excel,\none of my favorite applications.\n\n14\n00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.640\nIt doesn't get much better than this.\n\n15\n00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.890\nThey pay me to do this.\n\n16\n00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.840\nAll right, so what we're gonna\ndo today is, as Ronnie said,\n\n17\n00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.500\nwe're gonna take a look at ordering and\ngrouping some data.\n\n18\n00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.370\nWe also have a couple formatting things.\n\n19\n00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.170\nI don't know if we'd call them formatting,\nI guess I would,\n\n20\n00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.620\nbecause it's conditional formatting,\nso we'll call it formatting, and\n\n21\n00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.110\nsome cool little miniature graphs\nthat we're gonna throw in there.\n\n22\n00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.188\nNot giraffes, graphs,\nthat we're gonna throw in here, as well.\n\n23\n00:01:09.188 --> 00:01:13.200\nThis is just the way Microsoft\nlikes to organize their objectives.\n\n24\n00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.490\nThey call it ordering grouping data, and\nthen they throw spark lines in there.\n\n25\n00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.310\nSo just bear with us on that.\n\n26\n00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.820\nSo we're gonna start with\nconditional formatting.\n\n27\n00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.728\nNow, in a previous episode,\nwe did some formatting and, in particular,\n\n28\n00:01:24.728 --> 00:01:28.139\nI showed you some cell highlighting,\nwhere I could take a cell and\n\n29\n00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:32.123\napply a highlighting like good or bad,\nor code block, or things like that.\n\n30\n00:01:32.123 --> 00:01:36.110\nAnd I talked about being able to draw\nour attention to specific values.\n\n31\n00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.740\nSo within this chart or\nthis group of data,\n\n32\n00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.210\nI had some values that were really high,\nlike the highest value or\n\n33\n00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.360\nthe lowest value, that I could manually\napply some formatting to that.\n\n34\n00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.790\nThat's all well and good, but\na lot of times, my data is dynamic.\n\n35\n00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.290\nI want my formatting to be able to\nlook at the data and get applied based\n\n36\n00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.920\non the actual values, not me specifically\nsaying, cell G6 should be red.\n\n37\n00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.570\nI want the biggest numbers to be green.\n\n38\n00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.880\nI want the lowest numbers to be red,\nright?\n\n39\n00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.880\nThings like that, and if those\nnumbers change, change the formatting.\n\n40\n00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.550\nDon't make me go back and change it.\n\n41\n00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.560\nThat's what conditional\nformatting is all about.\n\n42\n00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.500\nFormat based on a condition\nthat you predefine, right?\n\n43\n00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.940\nAnd that condition could be anything.\n\n44\n00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.892\nIt could be greater than a value,\ngreater than the average,\n\n45\n00:02:21.892 --> 00:02:25.388\nless than the top 10%, or\nwhatever the case my be.\n\n46\n00:02:25.388 --> 00:02:29.847\nAnd Excel makes it extremely easy for\nus to do conditional formatting, and\n\n47\n00:02:29.847 --> 00:02:33.618\nthere's some really cool ones\nthat you can do now in 2016.\n\n48\n00:02:33.618 --> 00:02:34.620\nSo let's take a look.\n\n49\n00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.040\nI've got a sheet here.\n\n50\n00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.740\nI just made up some numbers.\n\n51\n00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.690\nI took my employees' last names.\n\n52\n00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.210\nPut them down that first column.\n\n53\n00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.340\nI've got my months across the top, and\n\n54\n00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.190\nthen I filled in some values in-between\nthere, and if you're looking at this data,\n\n55\n00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.530\nimagine being a C level or me turning\nthis in to one of my higher ups.\n\n56\n00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.210\nWell, how do they know how\nthe top seller is, right?\n\n57\n00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.120\nOr who's the one that really needs\nto be called into the office to\n\n58\n00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.250\nhave a little sit down with, right?\n\n59\n00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.680\nWho gets that bonus?\n\n60\n00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.160\nWho gets that pink slip\nbased on these numbers.\n\n61\n00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.720\nHard to tell.\n\n62\n00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.600\nThey all just kind of blur together, and\nI could try to find the biggest one.\n\n63\n00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.930\nI'm not gonna even waste my time doing it.\n\n64\n00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.620\nConditional formatting can do that for me.\n\n65\n00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.810\nSo what I'm going to do,\nis I'm gonna select my range of data.\n\n66\n00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.700\nRemember, you always\nwanna select to affect.\n\n67\n00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.720\nSo let me select the data that I\nwant to apply this formatting to,\n\n68\n00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.820\nand I'm gonna bring my ribbon back.\n\n69\n00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.820\nI closed it up to give it a little more\nroom for a second, and conditional\n\n70\n00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.730\nformatting is on my Home ribbon,\nright over here in my Styles group.\n\n71\n00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.150\nI hit this dropdown list, and\nthe first one I see is Highlight Cells,\n\n72\n00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.130\nall right, and when I hover over that,\nI'll zoom in a little bit,\n\n73\n00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.280\nyou see the different options that I have.\n\n74\n00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.930\nLet me move that over so\nI can get it away from my head.\n\n75\n00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.866\nHighlight Cells, Greater Than,\nLess Than, Between,\n\n76\n00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:58.468\nEqual To, Text Contains,\nA Date Occurring, Duplicate Values.\n\n77\n00:03:58.468 --> 00:04:02.870\nThat's a fantastic one if I'm looking for\nduplicates that shouldn't be there.\n\n78\n00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.820\nLet me scroll out now and\nshow you how it works.\n\n79\n00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.358\nI'm gonna simply do a Greater Than.\n\n80\n00:04:09.358 --> 00:04:13.282\nAll right, and you can see in\nthe background, it's already starting to\n\n81\n00:04:13.282 --> 00:04:17.090\nbecause it has a default value\nbased on the cell I had selected.\n\n82\n00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.100\nI should say, the first cell in the range\nof cells that I have selected, but\n\n83\n00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.910\nI can change that.\n\n84\n00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.490\nI know that we average\nsomewhere around $3500 a month,\n\n85\n00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.750\nor that's what my goal is for\nmy employees.\n\n86\n00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.336\nSo, I put $3500, and\n\n87\n00:04:31.336 --> 00:04:36.240\nI'm gonna change that formatting to\ngreen fill with dark green text.\n\n88\n00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.570\nYou can see the drop down list of\nchoices that I have over here,\n\n89\n00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:42.630\nand you can also do custom.\n\n90\n00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.240\nYou're not stuck with one of these.\n\n91\n00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.894\nI'll just use one of their built in ones\nand if I scroll out and click OK and\n\n92\n00:04:48.894 --> 00:04:50.508\nclick away from my data.\n\n93\n00:04:50.508 --> 00:04:51.600\n>> Nice.\n>> Look at that.\n\n94\n00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.980\nThose numbers really jump out at me,\nright?\n\n95\n00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.040\nAnd if you're thinking,\nhey, that's too many,\n\n96\n00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.660\nI wanna see who is really doing the best,\n\n97\n00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.530\nwe can simply modify that value that we're\nusing on that conditional formatting.\n\n98\n00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.731\nAll right, I can say, okay, that's too\nmany people to try to give bonuses to,\n\n99\n00:05:07.731 --> 00:05:09.570\nlet's see who's over 4000.\n\n100\n00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.410\nAll right, and I can still see\nthat's quite a few numbers.\n\n101\n00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.658\nSo maybe I want to jump that up to 4500.\n\n102\n00:05:18.658 --> 00:05:23.020\nSo now I've got a few less people,\nalthough it does seem to have kept some of\n\n103\n00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.300\nmy, I probably didn't undo that first one,\nthere we go.\n\n104\n00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.920\nLet's do that again.\n\n105\n00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:34.790\nLet's say we wanna go greater\nthan 4500 and I want those guys.\n\n106\n00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:35.590\nWe'll do a custom one.\n\n107\n00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:43.750\nWe'll say custom format and I want it\nto be filled with a nice green color,\n\n108\n00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.400\nand I want the font color to be red.\n\n109\n00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.098\nReally want it to stand out.\n\n110\n00:05:49.098 --> 00:05:49.718\nWe'll click OK.\n\n111\n00:05:49.718 --> 00:05:52.640\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We'll click OK, and there you go.\n\n112\n00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:57.042\nSo you can see who my sales people are,\nwhat their best performing months are,\n\n113\n00:05:57.042 --> 00:06:00.058\nright, and\nyou can do whatever formatting you want.\n\n114\n00:06:00.058 --> 00:06:02.338\nI'll undo that and we'll try another one.\n\n115\n00:06:02.338 --> 00:06:03.618\nThere's the top and bottom.\n\n116\n00:06:03.618 --> 00:06:07.622\nWe're going to highlight cells,\nyou got greater than, less than, between,\n\n117\n00:06:07.622 --> 00:06:08.172\nequal to.\n\n118\n00:06:08.172 --> 00:06:09.912\nTop and bottom are nice, right?\n\n119\n00:06:09.912 --> 00:06:13.012\nI just wanna see the top ten items.\n\n120\n00:06:13.012 --> 00:06:14.112\nHow about that?\n\n121\n00:06:14.112 --> 00:06:15.672\nAll right, and\nlet's do something different.\n\n122\n00:06:15.672 --> 00:06:18.753\nWe'll do that green again, right?\n\n123\n00:06:18.753 --> 00:06:21.330\nI'll click OK, and there you go.\n\n124\n00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.130\nThere's the top ten values.\n\n125\n00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:24.400\nI didn't have to sit there and look.\n\n126\n00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.520\nI didn't have to do what I\ndid in the previous demo,\n\n127\n00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.490\nwhere I had to guess 4000, 4500.\n\n128\n00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.720\nIt's gonna give me a small\nnumber of top sales.\n\n129\n00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:39.370\nWe'll just use that top ten, and\nthe top ten, you're not stuck with ten.\n\n130\n00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:44.400\nIt says top ten items, but let say, we're\nonly paying bonus to the top 15 items.\n\n131\n00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.020\nWell, I can change that to a 15.\n\n132\n00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.580\nOr I can change that to a five, right.\n\n133\n00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.495\nAnd now it's just gonna do, and\nlet me undo those changes so\n\n134\n00:06:51.495 --> 00:06:53.316\nwe can see those a little bit better.\n\n135\n00:06:53.316 --> 00:06:56.655\nAll right, top bottom, top ten items.\n\n136\n00:06:56.655 --> 00:06:58.470\nLet's say I only wanna do the top three.\n\n137\n00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.351\nWe only got first,\nsecond and third trophies.\n\n138\n00:07:00.351 --> 00:07:04.030\nSo we'll do the top three,\nand there they are, right?\n\n139\n00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.300\nSo you're not stuck just because it says\ntop ten, doesn't mean you have to do that.\n\n140\n00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.460\nThere's also 10%.\n\n141\n00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.088\nLet me undo my changes again.\n\n142\n00:07:11.088 --> 00:07:15.088\nAll right, you can say, you know what,\nI want the top 10%, and\n\n143\n00:07:15.088 --> 00:07:19.970\nas another one of those, you're not\nstuck with 10, maybe I want the top 5%.\n\n144\n00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:25.140\nAll right, so lots of cool little rules\nwithin this conditional formatting.\n\n145\n00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:28.700\nLet me undo my changes and let's take\na look at a couple of the others.\n\n146\n00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:35.240\nThose two, again, Top 10, Top Percent,\nBottom 10, Bottom %, Above Average.\n\n147\n00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.520\nThat's a fantastic one, right?\n\n148\n00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.800\nI don't have to sit here and\n\n149\n00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.330\ntry to figure out what the average is,\nit's gonna look at all those numbers.\n\n150\n00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:42.810\nFigure out what the average is and\n\n151\n00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:45.480\nthen highlight the cells\nthat are above average.\n\n152\n00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.347\nIf those numbers change,\nwell, the average changes,\n\n153\n00:07:48.347 --> 00:07:51.338\nand it's gonna take care of\nchanging that for me, right?\n\n154\n00:07:51.338 --> 00:07:54.546\nSo that conditional formatting\nlike that is fantastic.\n\n155\n00:07:54.546 --> 00:07:58.230\n>> There's no doubt, Mike, that I see\nthe incredible benefit and use of this.\n\n156\n00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:02.047\nWhen somebody is asking me to make a basic\nanalysis like you're talking about right\n\n157\n00:08:02.047 --> 00:08:06.170\naway and they're saying, look, can you\ngive this to me in the next five minutes?\n\n158\n00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.750\nWell, I could, if I have these tools and\n\n159\n00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.090\nthe nice thing about those preset ones,\nright?\n\n160\n00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:13.920\nthey're usually the most\nhighly requested ones\n\n161\n00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:18.010\nthat really do help us out by simply\nselecting just a couple of clicks away.\n\n162\n00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:20.088\nAnd then if I need to\nturn that into 15% or\n\n163\n00:08:20.088 --> 00:08:23.880\n17%, or whatever it might be,\nwe can change that.\n\n164\n00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.560\nBut I couldn't imagine\nmanually having to go through\n\n165\n00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.230\njust even that square of data that\nwe had or that rectangle of data and\n\n166\n00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:34.420\nsaying, yeah, here's the top 15\nsales that were made this month, and\n\n167\n00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:39.190\njust use a regular highlighter and\ndo that on a regular spreadsheet.\n\n168\n00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:40.250\nBut you can imagine then,\n\n169\n00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:43.980\nthe power that we have right here\nwhen the data is actually requested.\n\n170\n00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.400\nAnd I think that's where you're\ngonna see the power of this.\n\n171\n00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.880\nNot a lot of times on the presentation\ncuz even the top 15 that we have looked\n\n172\n00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.430\na little bit messy.\n\n173\n00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:55.080\nBut imagine being able right on the phone\nto say, all right here's what they are.\n\n174\n00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.270\nAnd here's where those figures come from.\n\n175\n00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:00.330\nAnd being able to show that, I think\nvery incredible, very powerful way.\n\n176\n00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:00.900\n>> Absolutely.\nAnd\n\n177\n00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:04.220\nwe talked earlier in that previous episode\nwhen we were talking about formatting\n\n178\n00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:07.500\nhow one of the big things that formatting\ncan do other than make it look pretty\n\n179\n00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.080\nis draw your attention to\nthe important information.\n\n180\n00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.340\nYou've got spreadsheets that\nhave tons of data on there but\n\n181\n00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.200\nnot all of it is relevant all the time.\n\n182\n00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.550\nA lot of times we just need to be\nable to get those top numbers or\n\n183\n00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:22.980\nthose bottom numbers out of there or\nstart to see trends.\n\n184\n00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:27.020\nYou know, I can see that Lopez\nbroke the average every month.\n\n185\n00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:30.690\nWhereas, Osbourne has been below\naverage every month, right.\n\n186\n00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:35.630\nI might not have noticed that without that\nconditional formatting that we applied.\n\n187\n00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.200\nNow, here's where it gets really cool.\n\n188\n00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.260\nI told you there's some cool ones.\n\n189\n00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:39.750\nThose were cool.\nAll right?\n\n190\n00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:41.040\nThese are even better.\n\n191\n00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.430\nCheck this out.\n\n192\n00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:43.140\nSame option.\n\n193\n00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.440\nI selected my data.\n\n194\n00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.180\nI'm going up to Conditional Formatting and\nI'm gonna go down to DataBars.\n\n195\n00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:48.800\nAll right?\n\n196\n00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.030\nAnd I'm gonna go to Gradient Fill.\n\n197\n00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.220\nAll right?\n\n198\n00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:56.420\nAnd this is a type of conditional\nformatting, gradient fill.\n\n199\n00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:57.440\nAnd let me just pick one.\n\n200\n00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.690\nI think green probably,\nred probably shows up the best.\n\n201\n00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:00.580\nWe'll do red.\n\n202\n00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.120\nJust so\nthere's different colors you can do.\n\n203\n00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:08.500\nGradient fill, what its going to do is\nif I click away and zoom in, alright.\n\n204\n00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:13.550\nYou're going to see,\nit figures out what the biggest number is,\n\n205\n00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.490\nwhat the maximum number is and\n\n206\n00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:19.870\nits says all right, I'm going to fill\nthe entire cell, for that biggest number.\n\n207\n00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:24.010\nZero would be my smallest number and\nthen all the others are scaled.\n\n208\n00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:28.920\n833, see how that colored bar only reaches\nout just a little bit, whereas $4,474,\n\n209\n00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:33.430\nalmost the whole cell is\nfilled with that gradient.\n\n210\n00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:38.100\nSo now, not only can I look at\nthe numbers, but even if I could zoom out\n\n211\n00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.020\nwhere I can't really read the numbers,\nI can still make out the gradient bars.\n\n212\n00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:45.980\nNot that you would ever wanna do that,\nbut you get the idea.\n\n213\n00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:52.080\nIt's a way to visually represent the data\nas well as numerically represent the data.\n\n214\n00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.800\nAnd I just think that's slick.\n\n215\n00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.450\nI don't know why.\nI really like the data bars.\n\n216\n00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:57.700\nLet me undo that one.\n\n217\n00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:02.210\nAnd we'll try another one of those guys.\n\n218\n00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:03.930\nWith the data bars,\nyou got the gradient fill.\n\n219\n00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:05.770\nYou also have solid fill.\n\n220\n00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:09.860\nJust be careful that your font\ncolor stands out on whatever\n\n221\n00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:11.030\nsolid fill you're doing.\n\n222\n00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:15.040\nBut that one's a little bit easier to see\nwhat I was talking about, as far as how\n\n223\n00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:21.390\nthe smaller numbers, the gradient is not,\nor the bar doesn't go all the way over.\n\n224\n00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:25.490\nThe larger numbers,\nthe bar almost completely fills the cell.\n\n225\n00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:27.840\nAnd you can tell the boss\nthat took you hours.\n\n226\n00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:28.750\nTo accomplish.\n\n227\n00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:31.990\nRight?\n[LAUGH] Some other ones you can do, so\n\n228\n00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:32.990\ndata bars.\n\n229\n00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:34.330\nPretty cool.\n\n230\n00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:35.760\nColor scales.\n\n231\n00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.870\nThis one, what it's gonna do,\nlook at that.\n\n232\n00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:40.360\nIt's gonna say, oops, I hover that again.\n\n233\n00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.610\nAnd we'll zoom in on\nthose tools tips there.\n\n234\n00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:47.610\nAll right.\n\n235\n00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:49.270\nGreen, yellow, red.\n\n236\n00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:52.500\nGreen for the biggest numbers,\nred for the lowest, and\n\n237\n00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.850\nthen at somewhere in between for\nthe middle numbers.\n\n238\n00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:59.030\nOr you can say red should be the high and\ngreen should be the low.\n\n239\n00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:01.070\nOr green to red with white in between.\n\n240\n00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:04.040\nAnd you can see all the different\noptions that you have.\n\n241\n00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:10.590\nAnd again, it's just giving me a way\nto visually represent this information.\n\n242\n00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:15.450\nSo there I've chosen just a green yellow\nscale where dark green's my biggest,\n\n243\n00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:18.940\nyellow's my smallest, and\nthen shades of green in between green and\n\n244\n00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.730\nyellow are going to be my middle numbers.\n\n245\n00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:24.600\nSo lots of really, we did that again.\n\n246\n00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.130\nYeah, we know.\n\n247\n00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:29.020\nLet me undo that and show you another one.\n\n248\n00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.820\nSo that was the data bar.\n\n249\n00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:34.440\nThe color scales, then there's icon sets.\n\n250\n00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:34.965\nWhat?\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n251\n00:12:34.965 --> 00:12:35.620\n>> Yeah.\n\n252\n00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:38.520\nAll right, so you can do arrows.\n\n253\n00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:39.390\nLook at that.\n\n254\n00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:44.550\nYou can do triangles, you can do arrows\nthat have like an in between, like green\n\n255\n00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:49.940\nis up, yellow can be on the way up or\non the way down, and red would be down.\n\n256\n00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:51.200\nYou could do stop and go.\n\n257\n00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.260\nYou know, stop light colors,\nthree colored stop lights.\n\n258\n00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.050\nFour colored stop lights indicators.\n\n259\n00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:58.930\nGreen check marks, red x's.\n\n260\n00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:00.040\nHopefully you guys can see those.\n\n261\n00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:04.180\nLet me zoom in a little bit as\nI hover over a couple of these.\n\n262\n00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.410\nSo you can see the different icon shapes.\n\n263\n00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:09.180\nFlags, green yellow and red.\n\n264\n00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:13.810\nRating systems, full star,\nhalf star, there's pie pieces.\n\n265\n00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.050\nLet me see if I can scroll.\n\n266\n00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:17.015\n>> Wireless bars.\n\n267\n00:13:17.015 --> 00:13:18.160\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n268\n00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.710\nyou got the wireless bars over here.\n\n269\n00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:22.980\nNow everybody knows what that means,\nright?\n\n270\n00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:26.650\nThat's one of those visual indicators\nthat we can all comprehend, so\n\n271\n00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:28.700\nyou want four steps of five steps?\n\n272\n00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.510\nWhat is that, we have four or\nfive different steps, or\n\n273\n00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:33.100\nRubik's cube looking things.\n\n274\n00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:38.290\nI mean these are all just built in and\nas far as the data's that's\n\n275\n00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:41.510\nbeing used like the biggest number and\nthe smallest number you can go in and\n\n276\n00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:46.180\nbuild more rules and you can set this\nformat only the cells that contain format\n\n277\n00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:50.610\nonly values that are above or\nbelow average.\n\n278\n00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:54.290\nSo you can come in here and\ncustomize these to your heart's content.\n\n279\n00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:59.220\nYou can use these icon sets, the data\nbars where you can choose what the top\n\n280\n00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.140\ncolor and the bottom color and\nthe gradient in between.\n\n281\n00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:04.200\nAll fully customizable.\n\n282\n00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:04.930\nGet in there and play.\n\n283\n00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:08.330\nI tell you I typically just use the ones\nthat are built in, cuz they're so good.\n\n284\n00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:12.970\nBut if you've got particular colors like,\nit's Gator Country around here.\n\n285\n00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:16.060\nOrange and blue might be\nthe colors that I wanna use for\n\n286\n00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.600\nmy gradients rather than red and green.\n\n287\n00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:22.380\nSo if you get company colors you\ncan feel free to change those rules\n\n288\n00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:23.510\nto do whatever you want.\n\n289\n00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:26.880\nBut very cool options with\nthat conditional formatting.\n\n290\n00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.730\nAnd it really gives you the visual\nimpact to go along with the data.\n\n291\n00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:33.430\nBecause I'm telling you,\nsomebody looks at this sheet of numbers,\n\n292\n00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:37.760\nthis list of numbers here I'm just like\nRonnie said, my eye's are blurred.\n\n293\n00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.700\nI'm just looking at it going.\n\n294\n00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.230\nOkay, looks like your\npeople sold some stuff.\n\n295\n00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:43.780\nBut I couldn't tell you who the best was,\n\n296\n00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:48.180\nwho the worst was, who's getting better\nover time, who's getting worse over time.\n\n297\n00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.730\nYou throw those conditional formatting\nin and it's gonna jump off the page and\n\n298\n00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:54.500\nit's gonna show you, hey,\nthis is your top seller.\n\n299\n00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:55.860\nThis is your worst seller.\n\n300\n00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:56.680\nThings like that.\n\n301\n00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:00.460\nWe had a meeting in June about sales,\nand you can see July and\n\n302\n00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.470\nAugust, the numbers really picked up.\n\n303\n00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:03.060\nThat kind of thing,\n\n304\n00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:07.120\nthat's what you can make happen,\nhighlight with those conditional formats.\n\n305\n00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:10.470\n>> There's no doubt in my,\nMac [LAUGH] Mike,\n\n306\n00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:13.760\nthat conditional formatting is\na very important tool for us.\n\n307\n00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:17.360\nBut there's even more tools available for\nus to make sure that we\n\n308\n00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:21.080\nshow exactly what we need to and\none of those tools is called Spark Lines.\n\n309\n00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:25.100\nNow what is a Spark Line and why in\nthe world would we ever use it Mike?\n\n310\n00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.710\n>> You know Spark Lines have\nnot been around that long.\n\n311\n00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:32.810\nI wanna say that they came out in\n2013 Office if I remember correctly.\n\n312\n00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:34.460\nDon't quote me on that.\n\n313\n00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:39.180\nSo they're relatively recent and\nthey're basically miniature graphs, right.\n\n314\n00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:44.231\nWe know that a graph is another\nway to represent data visually,\n\n315\n00:15:44.231 --> 00:15:48.615\nreally helps us spot trends and\npatterns in our data and\n\n316\n00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:51.212\nquickly because it's visual.\n\n317\n00:15:51.212 --> 00:15:56.006\nWell, we're gonna have a show dedicated\nto making charts so, don't worry,\n\n318\n00:15:56.006 --> 00:15:59.929\nwe're not giving up on those But\nmini charts that go in the cell,\n\n319\n00:15:59.929 --> 00:16:02.830\nthese guys are pretty cool, watch this.\n\n320\n00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:06.712\nI'm going to select all of the data for\nRodgers here, right?\n\n321\n00:16:06.712 --> 00:16:11.080\nAnd then I'm going to\nbring my ribbon back.\n\n322\n00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.090\nI think I hid that guy again.\n\n323\n00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:19.387\nAnd I'm going to go to insert,\nand then line, right?\n\n324\n00:16:19.387 --> 00:16:22.070\nIt says, where do you want to insert it.\n\n325\n00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:25.520\nAnd I'm just going to go ahead and\nselect the cell right next to his data and\n\n326\n00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:26.280\nI'll click okay.\n\n327\n00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.970\nAnd let me zoom in so you can see that.\n\n328\n00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:33.900\nThat is an actual graphical\nrepresentation of the data.\n\n329\n00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.082\nIf you don't believe me,\n\n330\n00:16:35.082 --> 00:16:37.670\nyou see the end of the line how\nit's going down at the end?\n\n331\n00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:42.325\nWell, let's change December to 4,000,\noops, not him.\n\n332\n00:16:42.325 --> 00:16:46.423\nLet's change December to 4,000.\n\n333\n00:16:46.423 --> 00:16:48.466\nAnd you see the tail of\nthat graph went up, right?\n\n334\n00:16:48.466 --> 00:16:53.070\nThat is a live graph of\nthe data in a single cell.\n\n335\n00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:55.680\nAnd we did our series fill the other day.\n\n336\n00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.370\nI don't think it'll work with this,\nlet's try it.\n\n337\n00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:00.030\nAnd I'll double click here.\n\n338\n00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:02.323\nIt doesn't like doing that, but\nlet me just drag this guy down.\n\n339\n00:17:05.121 --> 00:17:05.920\nAnd there we go.\n\n340\n00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:09.815\nI now have a little tiny\ngraph next to each person.\n\n341\n00:17:09.815 --> 00:17:13.850\nTalk about really quick indicator of data,\n\n342\n00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:15.970\nI can tell this person\nhad a slump somewhere.\n\n343\n00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:17.810\nLook at that big dip, and\nthen it goes right back up.\n\n344\n00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:19.880\nSo something happened during that month.\n\n345\n00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.860\nMaybe I want to do some more research,\nright?\n\n346\n00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:25.299\nIf this was product sales, all of a sudden\none of my products didn't sell for\n\n347\n00:17:25.299 --> 00:17:26.766\ntwo months, then it came back.\n\n348\n00:17:26.766 --> 00:17:27.925\nWhat happened there?\n\n349\n00:17:27.925 --> 00:17:32.115\nOr sales are going up and\nthey really skyrocketed in June.\n\n350\n00:17:32.115 --> 00:17:35.045\nThat coincides with that advertisement\nblitz that we did, right?\n\n351\n00:17:35.045 --> 00:17:38.630\nThis is ways that I can get that\ninformation out of the data very quickly.\n\n352\n00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:42.255\nAnd that's really what this is about\nis interpreting the data, right?\n\n353\n00:17:42.255 --> 00:17:43.600\nWe got the data in Excel.\n\n354\n00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.250\nExcel can do the formulas,\nit can add the numbers, but\n\n355\n00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:47.970\nwe then have to interpret the data.\n\n356\n00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:51.350\nWe have to get meaning out of the data,\nand that's where things like this come in.\n\n357\n00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:55.220\nAnd it's not just, we've got\nthe sparklines, but let's do another one.\n\n358\n00:17:55.220 --> 00:18:00.930\nLet's do Insert, we also have a column,\nright, which is same concept.\n\n359\n00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:04.760\nThis time I didn't select the data first,\nso it says where is your data?\n\n360\n00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:08.544\nSo I'm going to hit my little picker\nbutton and I'll select my data, or\n\n361\n00:18:08.544 --> 00:18:11.750\nI could type it in, either way, all right.\n\n362\n00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:13.420\nAnd then it tells me,\nwhere do I want to put it.\n\n363\n00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:16.316\nWell, since I had that cell selected\nalready, it filled it in for me.\n\n364\n00:18:16.316 --> 00:18:21.790\nI click okay, and now you can see I\nhave a miniature bar chart in that cell.\n\n365\n00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:24.410\nSame information,\nI can see that spike right there.\n\n366\n00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:25.990\nI can see that high column right there.\n\n367\n00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:28.690\nI can see this dip,\nI can see the dip right there as well.\n\n368\n00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:32.162\nSo just a different way\nto represent the data.\n\n369\n00:18:32.162 --> 00:18:36.530\nAnother one that you can do is a win loss,\nright?\n\n370\n00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:38.930\nNot this data does not\nlend itself to win loss.\n\n371\n00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:40.170\nI'll show it to you.\n\n372\n00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:42.825\nI'll select my data range, oops.\n\n373\n00:18:45.461 --> 00:18:49.100\nIf I can, let's see if I can, sometimes\nI run out of room on my trackpad.\n\n374\n00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:51.360\nAnd we'll drag that thing all\nthe way across, click okay.\n\n375\n00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.665\nAnd it's like, well wait Mike,\nwhat the heck is that, right,\n\n376\n00:18:54.665 --> 00:18:56.280\njust a solid blue bar.\n\n377\n00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.900\nWell, win loss is either a win or\na loss, right?\n\n378\n00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:03.780\nThere is no half-win, quarter-win,\nor anything like that.\n\n379\n00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.610\nSo with numbers,\nit's negative or positive.\n\n380\n00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:10.650\nIf I change one of these numbers to\na negative, which I know wouldn't\n\n381\n00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:15.550\nmake sense, but just to show you what that\ndoes, you see, there's my loss, right?\n\n382\n00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:19.290\nSo, if it's simple numbers where it's\neither positive or negative, or a one or\n\n383\n00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:20.940\na zero, or one or negative one or\n\n384\n00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:24.728\nsomething like that, that win loss\nmight be a great way to visualize it.\n\n385\n00:19:24.728 --> 00:19:28.020\nI know with some of the Microsoft\ntutorials you can go out on Office,\n\n386\n00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:31.458\nthey do the Microsoft softball league,\nright?\n\n387\n00:19:31.458 --> 00:19:33.780\nAnd they use the wins and\nlosses over there.\n\n388\n00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:36.450\nSo hey, maybe you're tracking\nyour kid's soccer team and\n\n389\n00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:38.080\nyou want to keep a win loss chart.\n\n390\n00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.853\nWell, there's an easy way to do it,\nall right?\n\n391\n00:19:40.853 --> 00:19:44.640\nSo those are sparklines, all of those\nwould be considered sparklines.\n\n392\n00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:48.030\nYou got the line,\nyou got the bar chart, and\n\n393\n00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:51.410\nthen you got that win loss\nthat you can do, all right?\n\n394\n00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:56.270\nSo great ways to visually\nrepresent that information.\n\n395\n00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:59.840\n>> Now Mike, the other thing that\nwe can also do inside of Excel\n\n396\n00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:04.980\nis to kind of flip our\nentire data set around here,\n\n397\n00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:10.102\nwhere columns become rows and essentially\nvice versa, rows become columns, right?\n\n398\n00:20:10.102 --> 00:20:13.370\n>> Absolutely,\nit's what we call transposing our data.\n\n399\n00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:16.390\nThis one, I've got it arranged with\nthe salesperson down the side and\n\n400\n00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:18.360\nI've got the months across the top.\n\n401\n00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.450\nSo when I look at the bottom of\nthe columns, well, I'm seeing totals for\n\n402\n00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:24.200\nthe month across all salespeople.\n\n403\n00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.290\nWell, I might need this\ndata flipped around.\n\n404\n00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:29.912\nMaybe I want to do it,\nmaybe I've only got 12 months, but\n\n405\n00:20:29.912 --> 00:20:32.390\nI've got hundreds of salespeople\nthat I want to track.\n\n406\n00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:34.680\nAnd I want to see it horizontally\ninstead of vertically.\n\n407\n00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.727\nThe different reasons you might\nwant to flip this data around,\n\n408\n00:20:37.727 --> 00:20:40.230\nit might make more sense\nto present the data.\n\n409\n00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:43.360\nIt might fit better on the spreadsheet\nbased on other data that's\n\n410\n00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.670\non that spreadsheet.\n\n411\n00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:47.630\nYou're simply going to copy and paste.\n\n412\n00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:51.440\nSo what I'm going to do is I'm going to\nselect all of my data here except for\n\n413\n00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:54.280\nmy totals and my trend lines there.\n\n414\n00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.655\nAll right, so I'm going to copy.\n\n415\n00:20:56.655 --> 00:20:59.580\nI'm going to do my copy.\n\n416\n00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:01.500\nThen I'm going to go create a new sheet.\n\n417\n00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:07.460\nAnd I'm going to do a paste, but\none of those paste specials.\n\n418\n00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:09.700\nHit my drop-down list and where is it?\n\n419\n00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:13.740\nThis guy right here is transpose,\nand I click that.\n\n420\n00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:17.192\nAnd now you can see my\nmonths are down the side and\n\n421\n00:21:17.192 --> 00:21:21.347\nmy sales people are across the top,\nso we transposed it.\n\n422\n00:21:21.347 --> 00:21:25.643\nNow, you see though that the formatting\ndoesn't work so well, right?\n\n423\n00:21:25.643 --> 00:21:29.159\nIt did copy the formatting when I\ndid that, and when it transposed it,\n\n424\n00:21:29.159 --> 00:21:30.740\nit doesn't make sense.\n\n425\n00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.600\nSo I'd have to go here and reformat that.\n\n426\n00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.070\nSo just keep that in\nmind with the transpose.\n\n427\n00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:42.380\nI can't do both paste values and\ntranspose, it won't work like that.\n\n428\n00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:46.660\nSo your choice would be to clear\nthe formatting before you copied it, or go\n\n429\n00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:50.580\nahead and transpose it, and then remember\nwhat I said, I can always just go in and\n\n430\n00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:54.710\nclear that formatting, and\nthen reapply my formatting as needed.\n\n431\n00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:57.880\nSo unfortunately, with the transpose\nit does bring the formatting along.\n\n432\n00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:01.860\nIf you got banded rows,\nthey kind of become banded columns.\n\n433\n00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:06.390\nBut you saw what happened to\nthe borders on my data, right?\n\n434\n00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:08.530\nI can see these little pieces\nof border coming down,\n\n435\n00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:10.070\nbut don't go all the way across.\n\n436\n00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:13.040\nThat's because over here,\nthose borders made sense.\n\n437\n00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.690\nFlip that data around,\nthe borders don't make sense anymore.\n\n438\n00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:17.310\nSo something to keep in mind.\n\n439\n00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:19.490\nEasy to transpose your\ndata if you need it,\n\n440\n00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:21.450\nformatting can become an issue with that.\n\n441\n00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:24.382\n>> There's no doubt Mike that\nthis would really save time,\n\n442\n00:22:24.382 --> 00:22:28.416\nespecially if you do end up inheriting\none of those worksheets in which the data\n\n443\n00:22:28.416 --> 00:22:31.738\nwould actually be much better\npresented when it is transposed.\n\n444\n00:22:31.738 --> 00:22:33.166\nYou have those two options, right?\n\n445\n00:22:33.166 --> 00:22:36.153\nYou can manually sit there and,\nyou don't have to manually,\n\n446\n00:22:36.153 --> 00:22:39.050\nyou can type it all in again,\nyou can do it copy and paste.\n\n447\n00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:40.620\nEven that's a little bit ridiculous.\n\n448\n00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:44.385\nBut being able to say, look,\ngo ahead and let Excel do it.\n\n449\n00:22:44.385 --> 00:22:49.110\nMan, that's actually saving you a ton of\ntime using the power of Excel right there.\n\n450\n00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:51.180\nThat's part of what we\nactually want to do, right?\n\n451\n00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:53.870\nLet Excel do the things that it's good at.\n\n452\n00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:58.046\n>> Absolutely, I love, I have no\nproblem scrolling vertically, right,\n\n453\n00:22:58.046 --> 00:23:00.177\nbecause most touch pads support it.\n\n454\n00:23:00.177 --> 00:23:03.340\nYou got your mouse wheel that you can do.\n\n455\n00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:07.680\nScrolling horizontally, at least in\nWindows, the touch pad does not work.\n\n456\n00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:11.212\nMy mouse wheel doesn't go that way unless\nyou got one of those really fancy mouses\n\n457\n00:23:11.212 --> 00:23:14.250\nthat'll lean, the scroll wheel will lean.\n\n458\n00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:18.287\nSo I've had people that have given me\nspreadsheets that are two rows deep, but\n\n459\n00:23:18.287 --> 00:23:19.750\n50 columns wide.\n\n460\n00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:22.390\nAnd I'm like what the heck,\nnow I've got to horizontally scroll.\n\n461\n00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:25.330\nI've got to come down here and\ngrab this thing and scroll over.\n\n462\n00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:26.990\nI just transpose the data.\n\n463\n00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:28.080\nNow I can scroll up and\n\n464\n00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:32.240\ndown very easily with two columns and\na hundred rows, right?\n\n465\n00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.800\nSo a lot easier, at least, in my opinion.\n\n466\n00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:39.525\nYeah, another way that we might want to\nmanipulate this data is to start grouping\n\n467\n00:23:39.525 --> 00:23:41.810\nit up as well as insert subtotals.\n\n468\n00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:46.243\nFor example, here in this spreadsheet I\nmight want to see all the orders done by\n\n469\n00:23:46.243 --> 00:23:47.463\nMemorial Hospital.\n\n470\n00:23:47.463 --> 00:23:50.892\nWell, the way the spreadsheet's arranged,\nit's not sorted, so\n\n471\n00:23:50.892 --> 00:23:55.004\ntheir orders are scattered throughout,\nand there's 3,000 rows in here.\n\n472\n00:23:55.004 --> 00:23:57.813\nSo if you wanna do any grouping,\nif you wanna do any subtotals,\n\n473\n00:23:57.813 --> 00:24:01.090\nwhat you've gotta remember is,\nyou have to sort it first, right?\n\n474\n00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:04.260\nExcel is good, it's really smart,\nand it's gonna help me do this, but\n\n475\n00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:06.540\nI have to kinda give it\na little bit of a head start.\n\n476\n00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:08.380\nI have to guide it in the right direction.\n\n477\n00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:12.640\nAnd I do that by sorting on\nthe column that I wanna group by.\n\n478\n00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:16.560\nSo for example, if I wanna do it by\ncompany, I might put my active cell\n\n479\n00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:20.310\nin that column, or I could select that\ncolumn, and then I would sort it.\n\n480\n00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:23.190\nWe'll go Sort and Filter, and\nthen I'll sort it A to Z.\n\n481\n00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:27.630\nAnd so now you see all the Florida\nhospital records come first.\n\n482\n00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:33.160\nAs we scroll way down here at some point,\nthat's gonna change from Florida hospital\n\n483\n00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:36.780\nto the next hospital and obviously\nif I keep scrolling to the next one.\n\n484\n00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:40.630\nSo now I've got all the orders\ngrouped by hospital.\n\n485\n00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:42.300\nNow I could have done it by date,\n\n486\n00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:45.010\nI could have done it by product\ndepending on what I want to do.\n\n487\n00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:46.590\nMaybe I want to group it based on product.\n\n488\n00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:50.720\nWhich hospitals are buying this\nparticular product, so we can sort it.\n\n489\n00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:54.070\nNow you can see I've got it\nsorted by product instead.\n\n490\n00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:58.980\nIn fact, that might be an easier one\nto do because there's more of them.\n\n491\n00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:01.840\nWe'll do it by product,\nwe'll get brave here and do it by product.\n\n492\n00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:06.670\nSo once you've got it sorted by whichever\ncolumn that you want to do the grouping\n\n493\n00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:11.440\non, the next thing you're\ngoing to do is go to your\n\n494\n00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:16.430\ndata ribbon and\nwe're going to insert a subtotal, right.\n\n495\n00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:21.440\nAnd a subtotal you could do this manually\nbut it's no fun doing it manually.\n\n496\n00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:22.050\nRight, Ronnie.\n>> Right.\n\n497\n00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:23.440\n>> I know we've tried before.\n\n498\n00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.430\nRight.\n>> There's no doubt that subtotaling is\n\n499\n00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:27.030\none of those unusual things right.\n\n500\n00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:30.537\nWhere you're really presenting totals by\nthe group in which ever way that you you\n\n501\n00:25:30.537 --> 00:25:33.870\nchose to group it but mainly doing it\nright as if you've actually having to do\n\n502\n00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:37.060\nwith that sub-total as well as\ngrand total and everything else.\n\n503\n00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:41.250\nRemember, take advantage of the tools that\nare in Excel, this is one of the neatest\n\n504\n00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:45.260\nthings that you can do because it\nreally does save you a lot of work and\n\n505\n00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:48.360\na lot effort if you at least\nunderstand these tools here and\n\n506\n00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:52.160\nyou're about to see as Mike actually\npresents us how easy it really becomes.\n\n507\n00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.760\n>> It really does make it easy.\n\n508\n00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:57.130\nSo once I clicked on subtotal that\nopened up this dialogue box and\n\n509\n00:25:57.130 --> 00:25:59.310\nit says at each change in company.\n\n510\n00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:02.680\nAll right now here's where you got to be\ncareful cause we took the time to sort it\n\n511\n00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:06.460\nby product and\nit's saying at each change in company.\n\n512\n00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:07.970\nWell that's not gonna work right?\n\n513\n00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:12.800\nBecause it's not sorted by that, so\nI need to change this to Product.\n\n514\n00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:15.710\nSo what it's saying is every time\nthe product changes, see it's Abilify,\n\n515\n00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:19.990\nAbilify, Abilify, Abilify here's where\nit changes from Abilify to Actos.\n\n516\n00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:24.700\nSo every time that occurs there's a change\nin product, what do you want it to do?\n\n517\n00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:29.400\nInsert a sum, an average, a count,\nwhat ever you want to do, and\n\n518\n00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:33.440\non what column do I want the unit price?\n\n519\n00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:37.060\nI really should have a totals column here,\nthat would make a little more sense.\n\n520\n00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:40.730\nIn fact, let's do this, we're just\nworried, we want to know what quantity,\n\n521\n00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:44.170\nand we'll do a Sum of the Quantity,\n\n522\n00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:46.680\ncuz we wanna see how many each of\nthis product we're actually selling.\n\n523\n00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:49.270\nReplace current subtotals,\n\n524\n00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:53.110\nif you already had subtotals in there you\ncould update them with this subtotal.\n\n525\n00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:56.720\nYou can do it on more than one, right.\n\n526\n00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:00.500\nI'm just gonna do it on Quantity, that's\nthe only one that would make sense to me.\n\n527\n00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:05.020\nSummary below data, if I don't do\nthat summary goes above the data.\n\n528\n00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.140\nI'll just leave that in there.\n\n529\n00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:07.830\nIf you're gonna plan on printing this,\n\n530\n00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:10.660\nmaybe you wanna do a page\nbreak between the groups.\n\n531\n00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:12.460\nAnd in fact,\nlet me just zoom in just a wee bit so\n\n532\n00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:14.660\nyou guys can see what\nI'm talking about there.\n\n533\n00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:18.940\nThe function I wanna use is gonna\nbe a count on the quantity.\n\n534\n00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.700\nWe're gonna replace current\nsubtotals if there were any.\n\n535\n00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:25.070\nI could do a page break\nif I wanted to print.\n\n536\n00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:29.020\nSummary's going below the data,\nfor every change in product.\n\n537\n00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:30.430\nI'll scroll back out.\n\n538\n00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:33.710\nWe'll click okay, and\nwhat it's going to do, hopefully,\n\n539\n00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:39.620\nis it's going to insert subtotal\nrows below each grouping.\n\n540\n00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:42.890\nAnd, it's going to insert an outline for\nme as well.\n\n541\n00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:44.710\nLet's see if it works, all right?\n\n542\n00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:51.020\nSo here you can see, all my Abilify's, and\nthen I've got an Abilify account and 12.\n\n543\n00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:52.610\nDid I do an average?\n\n544\n00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:54.400\nI did a count on the orders.\n\n545\n00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.800\nThat was kinda silly.\n\n546\n00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.110\nLet's change that.\n\n547\n00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:59.740\nWe can change that just as easy.\n\n548\n00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:04.680\nWell go back over to insert,\ntrying to insert data.\n\n549\n00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:08.000\nMy subtotal,\nI'm gonna bring that back up and\n\n550\n00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.420\nI'm gonna change that to a,\nwe want to do a sum or average?\n\n551\n00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:12.990\n>> Let's so a sum.\n\n552\n00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:13.610\n>> Let's do a sum.\n\n553\n00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:15.300\nSo we'll do a sum of the quantity.\n\n554\n00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:17.900\nI'll replace the current subtotals,\nI'll click okay.\n\n555\n00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:19.890\nAnd we should do a little bit better.\n\n556\n00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:21.930\nA little more meaningful information.\n\n557\n00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:22.830\nThere we go.\n\n558\n00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:26.323\nNow we've got a sum of the quantity so\nI got Abilify total.\n\n559\n00:28:26.323 --> 00:28:27.113\nAnd 431.\n\n560\n00:28:27.113 --> 00:28:29.570\nIf I go down there's Actos.\n\n561\n00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:30.940\nIt did all this for me.\n\n562\n00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:31.670\nI didn't have to go and\n\n563\n00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:37.060\nfind the break, insert a blank row,\ncreate the formula that it's gonna do.\n\n564\n00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:39.540\nAnd what's really cool is\nif I insert a new row.\n\n565\n00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:41.655\nWhat's that total right now Ronnie?\n\n566\n00:28:41.655 --> 00:28:44.160\n$11.21.\nI'm gonna insert a new row and\n\n567\n00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:48.880\nI'm going to put 1000 just\nto make it really different.\n\n568\n00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:50.560\nLook at my total.\n\n569\n00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:53.160\nDid you see the total go up to 2121?\n\n570\n00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:55.210\nSo once you do that grouping,\n\n571\n00:28:55.210 --> 00:29:00.670\nif new data gets put in here, if\nthe numbers change, that total's dynamic.\n\n572\n00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:06.195\nIf I change one of these numbers,\nthat subtotal changes.\n\n573\n00:29:06.195 --> 00:29:09.815\nAnd that'll be all the way down for\neach one of those products, and\n\n574\n00:29:09.815 --> 00:29:12.525\nI'm going to scroll really fast so\ndon't worry about reading it.\n\n575\n00:29:12.525 --> 00:29:15.105\nAll the way down to the bottom,\nbecause one other thing it does\n\n576\n00:29:16.495 --> 00:29:21.545\nis it gives me a grand total as well.\n\n577\n00:29:21.545 --> 00:29:24.950\nThat's doing that grouping and\ninserting those subtotals.\n\n578\n00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:27.400\nWhat I haven't shown you yet\nis the outline and\n\n579\n00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:30.480\nit's not even an extra\nstep it's already done.\n\n580\n00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:35.240\nYou might have notice here to the left of\nmy spreadsheet I have little extra space.\n\n581\n00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:37.540\nI got these numbered buttons over here.\n\n582\n00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:40.360\nAnd I have some little plus and\nminus symbols.\n\n583\n00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:44.060\nWhat this allows me to do\nis collapse a group right?\n\n584\n00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:45.550\nSo this is one group for Abilify.\n\n585\n00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:48.560\nI hit this minus sign next\nto the Abilify total row.\n\n586\n00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:51.390\nWell now, notice no more Abilify.\n\n587\n00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:55.210\nI still see the total, but\nall the details are gone, right?\n\n588\n00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:59.560\nAnd I could collapse each one of those up,\nor I could go to level two.\n\n589\n00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:03.560\nAnd that's gonna collapse them all up for\nme, right?\n\n590\n00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:06.060\nSo now there's all the different groups.\n\n591\n00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:11.140\nAnd if I wanna see a particular detail\non diazepam I can come over here and\n\n592\n00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:13.770\nexpand just that one group out.\n\n593\n00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:15.950\nThis is what C levels love.\n\n594\n00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:18.950\nThey love to see the summary information,\n\n595\n00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:20.960\nbecause that's typically\nall they want to do, right?\n\n596\n00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:25.020\nThey don't want the data, they don't want\nthe daily sales, they wanna know, hey,\n\n597\n00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:26.440\nhow much is our company making?\n\n598\n00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:27.870\nHow much of this product am I selling?\n\n599\n00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:30.240\nDo I need to go talk to whoever\nwe're getting this from?\n\n600\n00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:33.160\nThat kinda thing, that's what the higher\nups are typically looking for, and\n\n601\n00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.350\nso now I can do both.\n\n602\n00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:36.550\nIf you want just the totals fine,\n\n603\n00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:41.360\nif you want the details go back out to\nthat third level and get all the details.\n\n604\n00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:43.900\nIf you want just the grand total,\ngo to level one.\n\n605\n00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:45.170\nNow I don't have any product detail.\n\n606\n00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:47.490\nI've just got the grand total, right?\n\n607\n00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:51.450\nSo you can use the plus signs\nto expand and collapse, or\n\n608\n00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:55.710\nyou can use these numbers, level 1,\nlevel 2, level 3 on your outline.\n\n609\n00:30:55.710 --> 00:31:00.030\nLevel 3 would be your detail,\nlevel 1 would be your least detail.\n\n610\n00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:02.600\nSo really easy to do,\nExcel did it all for me.\n\n611\n00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.710\nAll I had to do was insert a subtotal,\n\n612\n00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:08.520\nfigure out what kind of totals I wanted,\nand I'm done.\n\n613\n00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:11.911\n>> There's no doubt that what we're\nactually starting to see now is we\n\n614\n00:31:11.911 --> 00:31:14.468\ncan take our data from being\nable to take the data and\n\n615\n00:31:14.468 --> 00:31:17.801\npresent it to now actually being\nable to really create reports that\n\n616\n00:31:17.801 --> 00:31:21.270\nare meaningful to other people\nbesides ourselves, right?\n\n617\n00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:25.370\nAnd this is done by being able to group it\nas well as sort it and even seeing some of\n\n618\n00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:29.170\nthose trend markers that we're talking\nabout If now someone like Mike were to say\n\n619\n00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:34.110\nall right well how is so and so\ndoing for this past year in their sales.\n\n620\n00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:35.830\nI can use that little Spark Line and\n\n621\n00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:39.506\nactually say well she's been on an up\ntrend during these past few months or\n\n622\n00:31:39.506 --> 00:31:43.717\nshe's really on a down trend but she's had\ngood performance in the past being able to\n\n623\n00:31:43.717 --> 00:31:46.540\nactually give a little bit\nmore meaning to that as well.\n\n624\n00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:50.636\nSo, by being able to use these tools to\npresent the data to us in the way that we\n\n625\n00:31:50.636 --> 00:31:54.671\nactually can see it It allows us to be\nable to give the feedback that we need.\n\n626\n00:31:54.671 --> 00:31:58.852\nBe able to actually say, here's the totals\nthat we want to be able to present, and\n\n627\n00:31:58.852 --> 00:32:03.320\nactually make it presentable in the way\nthat we're asked to present it as well.\n\n628\n00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:05.480\nSo there's a lot of useful tools for us.\n\n629\n00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:07.710\nOk Mike, any last things here?\n\n630\n00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:10.000\n>> I was going to show you one more thing.\n\n631\n00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.910\nLet's see if we can get this back.\n\n632\n00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:14.000\nSo we've got this outline\nhere that I've done.\n\n633\n00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.880\nWe did grouping on the product and\n\n634\n00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:19.930\nthen we did a count,\nwe did a sum of the count on that product.\n\n635\n00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:23.270\nWhat if I also want to\nbreak it by hospital?\n\n636\n00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:26.470\nAll right, because maybe they want to\nknow which hospital is buying the most of\n\n637\n00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:27.800\nthis product as well.\n\n638\n00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:30.050\nI can add another subtotal.\n\n639\n00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:31.460\nI can come back in here.\n\n640\n00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:33.010\nAnd I can say hey, at each change, and\n\n641\n00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:38.193\nthis time we're going to\ndo change in company, let's\n\n642\n00:32:38.193 --> 00:32:44.170\ndo another sum of the quantity,\nor should we do unit price?\n\n643\n00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:46.220\nAgain, it would make more sense for\nthe total.\n\n644\n00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:49.360\nI'll do unit price just for giggles,\nbut the total would make more sense.\n\n645\n00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:52.630\nbut I'm going to uncheck\nreplace current subtotal\n\n646\n00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:56.200\nwhich should leave my existing subtotals\nin there and just add this to it.\n\n647\n00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.240\nI'll go ahead and click okay.\n\n648\n00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:01.210\nAnd this might take it a minute to go out\nand calculate because there's lots of\n\n649\n00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:04.070\ngroups already and\nthat has to look at each group and\n\n650\n00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:07.310\nbreak it down by hospital and\nperform the calculation on there.\n\n651\n00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:10.460\nSo let's just give it a second,\nyou can see it flashing away down here,\n\n652\n00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:13.550\nworking away down here,\nworking hard on me.\n\n653\n00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:16.880\nGot my spinning Cheerio, so\nkeep our fingers crossed.\n\n654\n00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:20.260\nAnd there we go,\nI now have another level of grouping.\n\n655\n00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:26.530\nLet me click away, so you can see Florida\nHospital, and this is for just Abilify,\n\n656\n00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:32.280\nMemorial Hospital total St. Joseph's\ntotal, Tampa General, Tampa Shriners.\n\n657\n00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:34.500\nAnd then there's the total for\nthe all of the hospitals.\n\n658\n00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.120\nThere's the count, right.\n\n659\n00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:39.440\nAnd you see I got another\nlevel of outlining.\n\n660\n00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:42.820\nSo now if I want to collapse those up,\n\n661\n00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:45.740\nI can see each one of the hospitals and\nAbilify.\n\n662\n00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:46.450\nAll right.\n\n663\n00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:48.730\nSo let's jump to say\nlevel three like that.\n\n664\n00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:52.290\nSo look at that, I mean tell me\na boss wouldn't like this view.\n\n665\n00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:56.670\nHere's the different hospitals,\nthat have ordered Abilify, there's their\n\n666\n00:33:57.850 --> 00:34:02.080\ntotal, there's the Abilify total itself,\nall right?\n\n667\n00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:07.020\nIf I want to see how many times Memorial\nHospital, if I can say that, ordered.\n\n668\n00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:08.630\nI can get the details right there.\n\n669\n00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:10.370\nIt's not like the data went away.\n\n670\n00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:11.560\nIt's just hidden.\n\n671\n00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:16.430\nSo you can, jump to those different levels\nof the outline so, fantastic stuff.\n\n672\n00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:17.040\n>> Well excellent.\n\n673\n00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:20.800\nMike that looks like a great place for\nus to go and end this episode.\n\n674\n00:34:20.800 -->

They demonstrate the ease of creating a table using the built in tools and show how to use those table tools to get the data results we are looking for quickly and dynamically.  These features provide benefits to working with very large sets of data.   The guys also show how you can use tables to sort the logical data set to help with the reporting and display of the data.",

00:00:17.459\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong,\n\n4\n00:00:17.459 --> 00:00:21.380\nand today we're gonna be taking\na look at Microsoft Excel 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.230\nWe're specifically gonna be\ntaking a look at creating tables.\n\n6\n00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.020\nTables are a really powerful function\nthat we can find inside of Excel\n\n7\n00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.890\nto help us to logically\ngroup our data together, and\n\n8\n00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.090\nthat way we can actually manipulate\nthe data within that table and\n\n9\n00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.470\nmake it do the things and\nshow the things that want to.\n\n10\n00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.504\nAnd who better to help us to understand\nall of the magic that tables bring with us\n\n11\n00:00:40.504 --> 00:00:42.960\nthan the magic man himself, Mr.\nMike Roderick?\n\n12\n00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.730\nHow's it going, Mike?\n\n13\n00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.070\n>> [LAUGH] It's going great,\nRonnie, glad to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.860\nFun times with Excel and tables ahead.\n\n15\n00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.550\nAnd you're right, tables, I love tables.\n\n16\n00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.930\nI will tell you, I alway say this, right,\n\n17\n00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.593\nthere's one of my\nfavorite things in Excel.\n\n18\n00:00:55.593 --> 00:00:57.215\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You haven't heard that before.\n\n19\n00:00:57.215 --> 00:01:00.920\nBut I remember when I first started,\nwhen they first brought in tables, and\n\n20\n00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.840\nwe got to play with them and\nthey have a lot of power.\n\n21\n00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.370\nRonnie, before of the show\nwas teasing with, like, so\n\n22\n00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.540\nwhat are we gonna talk about tables?\n\n23\n00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.490\nWhy do we want to use a table?\n\n24\n00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.605\nI said, because they're pretty.\n\n25\n00:01:09.605 --> 00:01:10.850\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And they are,\n\n26\n00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.795\nthey do add some formatting to our data,\nbut there's so much more than that.\n\n27\n00:01:15.795 --> 00:01:17.647\nSo, let's take a look at\nthis sheet I have here.\n\n28\n00:01:17.647 --> 00:01:20.212\nI'm gonna kind of do a little compare and\n\n29\n00:01:20.212 --> 00:01:24.825\ncontrast to trying to do it ourselves\nversus trying to do it with a table.\n\n30\n00:01:24.825 --> 00:01:28.370\nAll right, so on this first sheet, and\nI think I've got all these guys lined up,\n\n31\n00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.000\nwe'll go to one of these other ones.\n\n32\n00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000\nI don't want to mess up\nmy first sheet there.\n\n33\n00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.340\nSo this is basically the same set of data.\n\n34\n00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.660\nI've got January.\n\n35\n00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.360\nA couple of different months here.\n\n36\n00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.000\nAnd what I might try to do,\nbecause this is not super legible, right,\n\n37\n00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.500\nit all kind of blurs together.\n\n38\n00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.660\nIt can be difficult.\n\n39\n00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.230\nSo one of the things I would probably find\nmyself doing is making that title row\n\n40\n00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.620\na little bit bolder and bigger than\nthe rest of the text, but then,\n\n41\n00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.550\nto try to follow this data across,\nI almost have to use my cursor.\n\n42\n00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.770\nI know I got old eyes and\nthings like that, so we might try and\n\n43\n00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:00.900\ndo some formatting.\n\n44\n00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.240\nI might do something like this.\n\n45\n00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.340\nI might say, all right,\nlet's take this row of data here and\n\n46\n00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.070\ndo a little background color on it,\nsomething like that.\n\n47\n00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.490\nAnd then, what I could do is I could\ntake my format painter, right,\n\n48\n00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.400\nand I could start applying that\nguy on these different rows.\n\n49\n00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.784\nAnd you can see I can kind of get some\ninteresting looks, and I'll just get rid\n\n50\n00:02:23.784 --> 00:02:27.850\nof that format, I won't go all\nthe way down, you get the idea, right?\n\n51\n00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.082\nSo now it's starting to\nlook a little bit better.\n\n52\n00:02:30.082 --> 00:02:36.604\nI might decide to put some borders around\neverything, so we might do All borders,\n\n53\n00:02:36.604 --> 00:02:41.340\nand then we might do a nice,\nthick outside border, right?\n\n54\n00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.040\nAnd it's starting to become\na little more user-friendly,\n\n55\n00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.890\nas far as looking at that data.\n\n56\n00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.410\nThe problem I have, though,\nwith doing it like this, one,\n\n57\n00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.740\nit's a very manual process.\n\n58\n00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.630\nImagine if this was a few hundred or\na few thousand rows.\n\n59\n00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.400\nI would almost wanna break out my VBA and\ntry to write a macro\n\n60\n00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.270\nthat would do this for me, which you\ndefinitely could, it's not that difficult.\n\n61\n00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.750\nBut still a little bit of\na tedious process to create that.\n\n62\n00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.220\nAnd then the problem becomes this.\n\n63\n00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.720\nWhat if I have to insert a row, right?\n\n64\n00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.590\nI go and insert a row.\n\n65\n00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.060\nWell, the formatting goofs up.\n\n66\n00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.120\nIt can copy the formatting from\nthe row above, or I can say, hey,\n\n67\n00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.030\ndon't do that, Excel.\n\n68\n00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.850\nDon't copy that formatting.\n\n69\n00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.250\nWell, now, all of a sudden,\nit's got no formatting at all.\n\n70\n00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.560\nIt's really gonna start goofing things\nup if I start inserting rows in there.\n\n71\n00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.360\nAnother thing that happens when\nyou're working with data like this,\n\n72\n00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.410\neven if you make it look pretty and\nlike a table, is when you go to sort it.\n\n73\n00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.560\nNow Excel is pretty\ngood about it nowadays.\n\n74\n00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.823\nIn the past, though, you could easily\nhose your data or mess your data.\n\n75\n00:03:40.823 --> 00:03:42.916\nI use the technical term hose there,\nRonnie.\n\n76\n00:03:42.916 --> 00:03:45.750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You could really mess your data up.\n\n77\n00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.740\nCuz what would happen, and\nlet's say I wanna sort it by product.\n\n78\n00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.490\nSo I come over here, do a little Sort and\nFilter, and do a Sort.\n\n79\n00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.200\nAnd luckily for me,\nall the data's touching, and\n\n80\n00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.310\nso it seems to sort all the rows.\n\n81\n00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.400\nBut if you're not careful, if there's any\nblanks, any cells that don't have values\n\n82\n00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.440\nin there, it'll sort the one column and\nnot the columns on either side.\n\n83\n00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.315\nSo now all the sudden,\nyou've completely ruined your data, right?\n\n84\n00:04:10.315 --> 00:04:12.560\nBecause now you've got products\nthat aren't on the right order,\n\n85\n00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.170\nnot with the right company.\n\n86\n00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.290\nYou better start doing Ctrl+Z or\nhope you have a backup of that worksheet.\n\n87\n00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.330\nSo we run in to a little bit of problems\nworking with data like this, and\n\n88\n00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.890\ntables solve all those problems.\n\n89\n00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.560\nAnother cool thing is filtering.\n\n90\n00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.290\nAnd we can do some filtering right here.\n\n91\n00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.000\nI can take this product column and\nI can go over to Sort and Filter.\n\n92\n00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.850\nAnd I can say, Filter and\nit adds these little drop down lists.\n\n93\n00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.510\nBut this is relatively new to Excel,\nit's within the last few versions.\n\n94\n00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.965\nRemember, way back when you and\n\n95\n00:04:43.965 --> 00:04:47.415\nI started it didn't have that\neasy filtering capability.\n\n96\n00:04:47.415 --> 00:04:51.915\nSo tables are gonna basically do\nall those things for us at once.\n\n97\n00:04:51.915 --> 00:04:53.645\nIt makes it very easy to work with.\n\n98\n00:04:53.645 --> 00:04:56.395\nLet me switch over to this other tab and\nI'll show you what I mean.\n\n99\n00:04:56.395 --> 00:04:58.985\nAnd they're extremely easy to create.\n\n100\n00:04:58.985 --> 00:05:02.515\nAll you have to do click\nsomewhere in your data.\n\n101\n00:05:02.515 --> 00:05:06.750\nThen you're going to go to your Insert\nribbon, and you're gonna choose Table.\n\n102\n00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.670\nAnd it's gonna ask you one question or\ntwo I should say.\n\n103\n00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:10.860\nWhere is your data?\n\n104\n00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.360\nAnd since all my data is touching,\nit's contiguous, it already has the range.\n\n105\n00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.400\nThere's, by default, a check mark there,\nmy table has header rows, which mine does.\n\n106\n00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.980\nIt has title for\neach one of those columns.\n\n107\n00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.880\nI click OK, and bada bing, that's it.\n\n108\n00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.880\nWe've got ourselves a table.\n\n109\n00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.660\nAnd so, you'll see that it's similar\nto what I was doing manually\n\n110\n00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:31.770\non that other sheet, right?\n\n111\n00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.220\nIt's got those banded rows in there.\n\n112\n00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.690\nThe header bar looks a little bit\ndifferent for the column headers.\n\n113\n00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.670\nIt's got those filters, but\nit did it all with one click.\n\n114\n00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.270\nI didn't have to do each one of\nthose steps individually, all right?\n\n115\n00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.640\nAnd Excel recognizes the table itself.\n\n116\n00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.150\nAnd that's gonna become very important for\na few different things and\n\n117\n00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.830\nespecially formulas when\nwe get into that episode.\n\n118\n00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.353\nFor example, let me show you what\nhappens when I insert a row.\n\n119\n00:05:58.353 --> 00:06:02.537\nAll right, I'm gonna insert a row at six,\nso it's gonna move six down and\n\n120\n00:06:02.537 --> 00:06:04.104\nI'm gonna get a new row 6.\n\n121\n00:06:04.104 --> 00:06:07.097\nI'll say Insert, and\nnotice when I click away,\n\n122\n00:06:07.097 --> 00:06:09.733\nthe banding remains consistent, right?\n\n123\n00:06:09.733 --> 00:06:13.494\nIt changed that row blue, and everything\nelse is now alternating blue and white.\n\n124\n00:06:13.494 --> 00:06:16.820\nSo it's smart enough to move\nthat formatting around.\n\n125\n00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:17.952\nSame thing when I delete it.\n\n126\n00:06:17.952 --> 00:06:19.670\nYou would think I might\nhave a white row and\n\n127\n00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:24.040\na white row together when I\ndelete this blue row, all right?\n\n128\n00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.540\nBut it's smart enough to say, hey, okay,\n\n129\n00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.690\nI'm gonna reformat it as\nthat data shifts around.\n\n130\n00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.600\nSo, as you're inserting new elements or\n\n131\n00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.380\nrecords into your table, it's gonna\ntake care of all of that for you.\n\n132\n00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.540\nYou automatically get these filter\nbuttons up across the top, and\n\n133\n00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.820\nI love these little filter buttons.\n\n134\n00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.310\nI don't like them out there all the time,\nI'll tell you that, but\n\n135\n00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:43.437\nI love their functionality.\n\n136\n00:06:43.437 --> 00:06:48.577\nYou click on it, and you can sort by\na particular column, A to Z, Z to A.\n\n137\n00:06:48.577 --> 00:06:52.377\nSort by color, if you had done some\nof those conditional formattings that\n\n138\n00:06:52.377 --> 00:06:56.548\nwe talked about the other day, where\nyou're coloring different things based on\n\n139\n00:06:56.548 --> 00:06:58.600\nthe value, you can then sort by color.\n\n140\n00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:03.400\nAnd again, it treats the data as one unit,\nas a table there, so\n\n141\n00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.330\nI don't have to worry about it\nnot sorting the first column\n\n142\n00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:10.690\nwhen it rearranges the second column or\nthe third column, whatever you're doing.\n\n143\n00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.670\nLet me get rid of that sort for\nus there, or\n\n144\n00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.420\nactually I'll just leave that,\ndoesn't matter.\n\n145\n00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.490\nYou've got some great text\nfilters built into here.\n\n146\n00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:23.100\nI can say Begins with the letter,\nI don't know which letters we're using, D.\n\n147\n00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.660\nAnd I'll say OK.\n\n148\n00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.700\nAnd there's all my products\nthat start with a D.\n\n149\n00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.910\nAgain, it's just a filter.\n\n150\n00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:30.320\nThe data isn't gone.\n\n151\n00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.160\nYou notice my row numbers, right,\nall the data is still there.\n\n152\n00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.900\nI can just remove that text filter.\n\n153\n00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:38.740\nWe'll just uncheck it over there.\n\n154\n00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.940\nIf I can get rid of my filter.\n\n155\n00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.960\nWhere's my clear filter?\n\n156\n00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:44.942\nGoodness gracious, there we go.\n\n157\n00:07:44.942 --> 00:07:48.220\nClear filter is above it now,\nit's not on the list anymore.\n\n158\n00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.689\nSo I'll clear that filter,\nand all of my data is back.\n\n159\n00:07:50.689 --> 00:07:55.174\nFor numbers, a lot of times, this is\nreally handy, cuz they've got some special\n\n160\n00:07:55.174 --> 00:07:59.594\nnumber filters that we can do, where you\ncan say Greater Than, or Greater Than Or\n\n161\n00:07:59.594 --> 00:08:02.208\nEqual To, or\nBetween a certain value, right?\n\n162\n00:08:02.208 --> 00:08:05.279\nYou also get a list of\nall the unique values.\n\n163\n00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:09.945\nSo if you just wanna see all\nthe products that sold for $10.31,\n\n164\n00:08:09.945 --> 00:08:11.970\nwell there they are, right?\n\n165\n00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:18.490\nI can go back in, and I can select\nall to get all of my data back.\n\n166\n00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.350\nOrder dates, there's a common one to do.\n\n167\n00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.550\nI wanna do a text filter.\n\n168\n00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:26.670\nIf I can get my fly out to come out again.\n\n169\n00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:31.190\nBetween, or we can say contains,\n\n170\n00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:35.340\nunfortunately I think I actually\nhave that formatted as text and\n\n171\n00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.950\nnot a date, so\nmy filters aren't quite right.\n\n172\n00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.870\nLet's change that to a date.\n\n173\n00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:45.670\nAnd now when I do my filters.\n\n174\n00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.210\nIt's still showing me text filters.\n\n175\n00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:51.370\nAnd that's my fault,\nI think I formatted that as text and\n\n176\n00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:52.670\nnow it doesn't wanna pick that fact up.\n\n177\n00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.870\nIf I could remove the table and add it\nagain, and we'll do that here in a second.\n\n178\n00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:59.530\nBut you see that the flexibility\nthat you get with this table.\n\n179\n00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.870\nSo really is nice to work with.\n\n180\n00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:02.710\n>> There's no doubt, Mike.\n\n181\n00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:06.890\nWhat I'm seeing here is the dynamic way we\ncan actually handle our data very quickly\n\n182\n00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:10.200\nto get answers that we need once\nwe actually create the table\n\n183\n00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.750\nthat we start off with here.\n\n184\n00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:14.120\nNow Mike, the idea of actually\nbeing able to sort and\n\n185\n00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.110\nbeing able to do the things that\nyou've shown us is very important.\n\n186\n00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.900\nEspecially being able to do them quickly,\n\n187\n00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.370\nwhat other features can we actually\nexpect inside of the tables?\n\n188\n00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:24.940\n>> A couple of things that\nwe need to look at, and\n\n189\n00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.370\nfirst thing I wanna show you is adding and\nremoving.\n\n190\n00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:29.380\nWell, I showed you inserting a row, right?\n\n191\n00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:31.398\nThe same thing would happen for a column.\n\n192\n00:09:31.398 --> 00:09:34.660\nIf I come over here and\nchoose to insert a column,\n\n193\n00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:38.410\nit's gonna shift all those\nguys over just like normal.\n\n194\n00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:42.507\nBut notice this column is part of my\ntable, the formatting gets extended,\n\n195\n00:09:42.507 --> 00:09:44.930\nI get my new filter button there.\n\n196\n00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:48.870\nIf I remove that column,\nit's gonna shift back.\n\n197\n00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:51.430\nAgain, and it really treats it as a unit.\n\n198\n00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:55.020\nNow, if I try to do an insert cells,\nit's a little bit interesting.\n\n199\n00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.300\nRemember the other day we learned,\nin a previous episode,\n\n200\n00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:02.200\nhow when I insert a cell it's gotta either\nshift everything to the right or down.\n\n201\n00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.240\nWhen I delete a cell it has to\nshift everything to the left or up.\n\n202\n00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.430\nCuz I'm inserting a one little cell.\n\n203\n00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:09.150\nHere it's gonna work a little different.\n\n204\n00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:14.270\nNotice that I don't have an insert\ncell option at all if I right click.\n\n205\n00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:15.380\nI can force it.\n\n206\n00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.690\nI can go to the cells ribbon group.\n\n207\n00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:21.340\nAnd I can do insert cells.\n\n208\n00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:25.940\nCuz it didn't ask me anything, it\nautomatically just inserted a row, right?\n\n209\n00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.850\nSo really can't insert\nindividual cells in a table.\n\n210\n00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:30.970\nYou can insert rows.\n\n211\n00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:32.010\nYou can insert columns.\n\n212\n00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:37.875\nOther things that we wanna be able to do\nwith our table, are defining its title.\n\n213\n00:10:37.875 --> 00:10:42.050\nNow, the title will come into play\nwhen we start working with formulas.\n\n214\n00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:43.890\nBut let me show you where you do that.\n\n215\n00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:47.180\nIf we go back over to the,\nif I click on my table.\n\n216\n00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.830\nI get that table tools\ndesign contextual ribbon,\n\n217\n00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.950\nthat only shows up when I'm\nworking with that table.\n\n218\n00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:57.600\nI click on that, and over here we've\ngot a name, and you see it's table two.\n\n219\n00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.770\nI was playing with this sheet earlier.\n\n220\n00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:02.130\nI had made a table earlier and removed it.\n\n221\n00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:03.540\nSo it just increments the name.\n\n222\n00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:07.493\nBut the problem is if you ever work with\na bunch of tables, you get table two,\n\n223\n00:11:07.493 --> 00:11:09.990\ntable three, table four,\nand things like that.\n\n224\n00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:14.197\nAnd when you go to write your formulas and\nreference those tables, it's like wait,\n\n225\n00:11:14.197 --> 00:11:17.294\nwhich one was table four, or\nis that table three or table two?\n\n226\n00:11:17.294 --> 00:11:18.644\nSo you can give them names.\n\n227\n00:11:18.644 --> 00:11:22.670\nYou come up here and you can change\nthis to whatever you'd like.\n\n228\n00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:26.350\nThen, I'll call this January,\nor just J-A-N for short.\n\n229\n00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:28.230\nOr maybe Jansales.\n\n230\n00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.560\nOne thing you wanna make sure you\ndo with those names, no spaces.\n\n231\n00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.117\nIt's not gonna like spaces in those names.\n\n232\n00:11:33.117 --> 00:11:37.473\nAnd then I can refer to this table later\non in a formula which I'll show you when\n\n233\n00:11:37.473 --> 00:11:40.306\nwe get to the formulas episode,\nmy name, right?\n\n234\n00:11:40.306 --> 00:11:43.480\nSo I don't have to worry about,\nis it table three or is it table 13.\n\n235\n00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.690\nI can just use that name.\n\n236\n00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:50.405\nSo that's what they call defining\nthe title of those tables.\n\n237\n00:11:50.405 --> 00:11:53.865\nNow, other things we can do, and\nI guess before I get to, well,\n\n238\n00:11:53.865 --> 00:11:55.035\nI'll show you that in a minute.\n\n239\n00:11:55.035 --> 00:11:59.245\nAnd next thing I wanna show you here,\nRonnie, is applying styles to tables.\n\n240\n00:11:59.245 --> 00:12:04.119\nWhen I created that table, all I did was\ninsert table, and I got this default\n\n241\n00:12:04.119 --> 00:12:09.025\ndark blue table header with the light\nblue and white alternating rows.\n\n242\n00:12:09.025 --> 00:12:11.705\nThere are a few other things\nthat I can do to this table,\n\n243\n00:12:11.705 --> 00:12:14.030\none of them being pick different colors.\n\n244\n00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:16.160\nWe love to pick different colors, right?\n\n245\n00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.050\nSo if we go over here to\nour table styles again,\n\n246\n00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:20.850\nI'm on that design ribbon,\nthat contextual ribbon.\n\n247\n00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:22.880\nAnd remember, if that ribbon goes away,\n\n248\n00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.350\nit's because you don't have\na table selected, right?\n\n249\n00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:27.980\nClick on a table,\nthe ribbon comes back, and\n\n250\n00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:32.150\nthen I have a whole slew\nof styles to choose from.\n\n251\n00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:35.130\nAnd I get my handy dandy live preview.\n\n252\n00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:37.880\nThey're kind of organized,\nyou got light right here,\n\n253\n00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:41.480\nand you got the different colors you\ncan go through, blues and greens.\n\n254\n00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:45.200\nYou've got medium, which is gonna be a\nlittle bit darker as far as the colors go.\n\n255\n00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.900\nSame color choices.\n\n256\n00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:51.720\nIf I scroll down, I've got my dark, where\nI can get really dark with these guys.\n\n257\n00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.830\nRight?\nReally depends on what you want,\n\n258\n00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:55.730\nwhat you're trying to do.\n\n259\n00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:01.240\nSo I don't know Ronnie,\nlet's just pick one crazy one here.\n\n260\n00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.550\nThere we go.\n\n261\n00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:03.650\nSo there's my table styles.\n\n262\n00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:07.280\nSo easy enough to change that table style.\n\n263\n00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:11.390\nThe other thing we can change, and\nback over to my table contextual ribbon,\n\n264\n00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:14.650\nthere's a whole bunch of style\noptions listed here, right?\n\n265\n00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:16.490\nAnd they're just check marks.\n\n266\n00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:19.510\nNow, if your table didn't\nhave a header row,\n\n267\n00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:23.080\nif it was just straight data,\nyou could uncheck that, right?\n\n268\n00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.230\nAnd it would remove that.\n\n269\n00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:26.460\nIn my case, it removes the entire row.\n\n270\n00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:30.440\nBut basically, what the header row does,\nis it's gonna format that header row\n\n271\n00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:33.260\nslightly different from\nthe rest of the table, right?\n\n272\n00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:34.780\nAs we went over those different styles,\n\n273\n00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:39.090\nyou see how it's a darker orange at\nthe top, a darker yellow at the top?\n\n274\n00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:42.340\nWell, if I don't have a header row,\nI don't need that type of styling,\n\n275\n00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.710\nso it's gonna leave that out, right?\n\n276\n00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:48.250\nThe banded rows is turned on by default.\n\n277\n00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:50.760\nIf I uncheck that,\nthey're no longer banded.\n\n278\n00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.600\nIt's just a solid color.\n\n279\n00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.360\nCan easily turn that back on.\n\n280\n00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.810\nYou can also band columns.\n\n281\n00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:59.810\nMaybe it makes sense for\nyour data to band it this way,\n\n282\n00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:03.860\nif you're more likely reading it\nvertically rather than horizontally.\n\n283\n00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:08.420\nThis allows you to stay within that\ncolumn very easily by the formatting.\n\n284\n00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:10.655\nYou could do both, but\nthat just looks odd.\n\n285\n00:14:10.655 --> 00:14:15.570\n[LAUGH] You can do last column.\n\n286\n00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:18.640\nIf I had a totals.\n\n287\n00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:19.820\nI'm gonna show you another cool trick.\n\n288\n00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.110\nI'm gonna put totals there.\n\n289\n00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:22.220\nNotice what it did.\n\n290\n00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.690\nWe'll do that again.\n\n291\n00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:24.200\nAll right?\n\n292\n00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.320\nSo this is currently not part of my table.\n\n293\n00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.860\nMy table ends here.\n\n294\n00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.909\nAll I'm gonna do is type in totals.\n\n295\n00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:35.380\nHit enter, and it says hey,\nthat's right up against the table.\n\n296\n00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:38.110\nOdds are, you're trying to add\nanother column to the table, so\n\n297\n00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:39.700\nlet me go ahead and format it like that.\n\n298\n00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.664\nIf I didn't want it to do that,\nI could always uncheck that and\n\n299\n00:14:42.664 --> 00:14:44.500\nsay, undo table expansion.\n\n300\n00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:49.050\nAnd then I have regular column and\nnot part of my table, but\n\n301\n00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:50.130\nnow I want that back.\n\n302\n00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:51.740\nSo, it don't remember my choice.\n\n303\n00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.720\nThere we go.\nAnd I'm just gonna put a quick\n\n304\n00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.340\ntotal in here.\n\n305\n00:14:54.340 --> 00:15:00.673\nI'm just gonna say,\nequals quantity times unit price.\n\n306\n00:15:00.673 --> 00:15:03.172\nAnd notice what it's doing here, right?\n\n307\n00:15:03.172 --> 00:15:06.740\nInstead of saying column D,\nit says at quantity.\n\n308\n00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:10.278\nNow, we'll take another look at\nthat when we get into formulas, but\n\n309\n00:15:10.278 --> 00:15:13.415\nit's an important distinction\nin my formula there.\n\n310\n00:15:13.415 --> 00:15:14.545\nI'll go ahead and hit enter.\n\n311\n00:15:14.545 --> 00:15:19.380\nIs that it's referring to it by not\nthe letter D like we normally do in Excel.\n\n312\n00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:22.310\nIt's referring to it by\nthe table column header.\n\n313\n00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:25.440\nAgain, a lot easier for\nme to work with and remember.\n\n314\n00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:30.800\nI can say, hey I wanna multiply\nat quantity by at unit price.\n\n315\n00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:35.830\nI don't have to go, wait,\nwas unit in column D or column E, right?\n\n316\n00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:37.069\nI can just use those names.\n\n317\n00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:39.657\nAnd I forgot where I was going with that,\nyeah.\n\n318\n00:15:39.657 --> 00:15:44.216\nSo, let me zoom back out and\ngo back over to my table tools, and\n\n319\n00:15:44.216 --> 00:15:47.559\nsome of the other ones\nI have are last column.\n\n320\n00:15:47.559 --> 00:15:51.720\nI can format that last column a little\ndifferently since that's my totals,\n\n321\n00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:54.459\nmaybe I want to add some\nspecial formatting to it.\n\n322\n00:15:54.459 --> 00:15:58.788\nOr maybe you want the first column a\nlittle slightly different from the rest of\n\n323\n00:15:58.788 --> 00:15:59.459\nthe table.\n\n324\n00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:00.199\nAll right?\n\n325\n00:16:00.199 --> 00:16:01.819\nSo see how easy that is?\n\n326\n00:16:01.819 --> 00:16:05.890\nAnd again it's gonna remember that and\nyou'll see all the styles change as well.\n\n327\n00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:12.060\nIt's really pretty cool and\npretty darn easy to work with.\n\n328\n00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:13.650\nI can also do a totals row.\n\n329\n00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:15.330\nLet's jump down to the bottom here.\n\n330\n00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:21.810\nJust so you can see that I currently\ndo not have any totals going on.\n\n331\n00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:23.610\nI can choose Total Row.\n\n332\n00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:25.137\nIt's gonna format it slightly different.\n\n333\n00:16:25.137 --> 00:16:30.560\nYou'll see all my styles changed to\nindicate that and it adds a total for me.\n\n334\n00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:33.840\nAnd I could write some other\nformulas in here if I needed to.\n\n335\n00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:36.690\nIn fact, it gives me a drop down list,\nand I can just go ahead and pick.\n\n336\n00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:38.810\nI want an average.\n\n337\n00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:39.420\nThere.\n\n338\n00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:45.100\nHere, I think I wanted do a I don't know,\nwe'll do a max,\n\n339\n00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:48.810\nor a min, or a standard deviation,\nor whatever it is you want to do.\n\n340\n00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:50.760\nI mean how easy is that, right?\n\n341\n00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:54.280\nAll I did was come over here and\ncheck Totals Row.\n\n342\n00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:59.150\nSo lots of cool things that\nI can do with these tables.\n\n343\n00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:03.030\nAnd again, whenever you get into some\nof the more advanced Excel classes,\n\n344\n00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:06.770\nwhen I start doing macros and\nVBA and things like that,\n\n345\n00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:11.280\nwe're programmatically inserting\nrows into these sections of data.\n\n346\n00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:16.397\nAs we start to automate, like import\nprocesses and things like that,\n\n347\n00:17:16.397 --> 00:17:20.496\ntables are really handy because of\nthe fact that they treat it as a unit.\n\n348\n00:17:20.496 --> 00:17:25.210\nAnd when it inserts rows in there, it'll\nautomatically move that totals row down.\n\n349\n00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:27.800\nI don't have to manually do that or\nreadjust.\n\n350\n00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:33.100\nWhere trying to find the last in\nthe table is super easy using VBA.\n\n351\n00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:36.504\nTrying to find the last row of\nthe data without a table is\n\n352\n00:17:36.504 --> 00:17:38.952\na lot more complex actually using VBA.\n\n353\n00:17:38.952 --> 00:17:41.127\nYou have to go down to\nthe first empty row and\n\n354\n00:17:41.127 --> 00:17:43.070\nthen back up one to find your last row.\n\n355\n00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:46.920\nIt's really strange, but in a table, I\ncan just go to the last row in the table.\n\n356\n00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.260\nSo lots of cool things that come\nalong with tables, as you see.\n\n357\n00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.642\nVery easy to work with.\n\n358\n00:17:52.642 --> 00:17:55.592\nWhat else?\nWe do need to be able to remove styles now\n\n359\n00:17:55.592 --> 00:17:59.466\nand again, cuz you might find\nthat somebody has come along and\n\n360\n00:17:59.466 --> 00:18:02.000\nmaybe they've done this one.\n\n361\n00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:02.710\nAll right.\n\n362\n00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:07.620\nAnd it's so dark and it's not\nreally easy to work with that data.\n\n363\n00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.090\nDefinitely not gonna present well.\n\n364\n00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:10.901\nI don't want to print that, right?\n\n365\n00:18:10.901 --> 00:18:14.900\nAnd I can't even see my\nheader names up there.\n\n366\n00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:16.050\nSo how do I get rid of that style?\n\n367\n00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:18.880\nWell I could just change\nit to something else, but\n\n368\n00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:21.030\nmaybe I just don't want styles anymore.\n\n369\n00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:24.290\nThere is an option to come over here,\nhit your drop down list.\n\n370\n00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:25.290\nAnd back up at the top,\n\n371\n00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:30.340\nthis first top-left corner, if I hover\nover it, it should say no style.\n\n372\n00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:31.570\nThere you go, None.\n\n373\n00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:34.180\nI select it and everything's gone.\n\n374\n00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.450\nBut I'm gonna put one back just\nbecause I like their styles.\n\n375\n00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:41.260\nAll right,\nwe can also get rid of the table.\n\n376\n00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.180\nIf we find that the table doesn't work for\nus and\n\n377\n00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:46.590\nthere's some reason that we don't want it\nto be a table, we're not stuck, right?\n\n378\n00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:51.920\nIt was pretty easy to convert it into\na table, select your data, insert table.\n\n379\n00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.620\nOnce it's a table,\nI go to this design ribbon and\n\n380\n00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:57.260\nI choose Convert to Range, right?\n\n381\n00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.380\nIt says, do you want to convert\nthis table to a normal range?\n\n382\n00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:05.590\nI say yes, and notice my filter buttons\nwent away and it's no longer a table.\n\n383\n00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:10.430\nWhen I click on it, I don't get my table,\ncontextual ribbon or anything like that.\n\n384\n00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:11.580\nSo the table is gone.\n\n385\n00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:15.774\nIf I want to turn it back into a table,\nI can just go Insert Table,\n\n386\n00:19:15.774 --> 00:19:20.040\nyes I have header rows,\nOK, and I'm a table again.\n\n387\n00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.720\n>> Now Mike, actually I think you\nbring up a good point, especially for\n\n388\n00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.450\nthose that are preparing for\ntheir MOS exam here.\n\n389\n00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:29.280\nThat a lot of times you can be tricked\nby just that very simple appearance\n\n390\n00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.690\nof a table, but it's not really a table.\n\n391\n00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:34.750\nOne of the easiest ways to be\nable to identify that, right,\n\n392\n00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:38.160\nis what Mike showed us,\nwhich is by clicking in the table.\n\n393\n00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:41.685\nIf you get that contextual ribbon,\nwhat is it called, design?\n\n394\n00:19:41.685 --> 00:19:43.550\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> If you get that contextual ribbon,\n\n395\n00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:45.564\nthen you know that a table\nis actually there,\n\n396\n00:19:45.564 --> 00:19:47.583\nand somebody didn't just format the table.\n\n397\n00:19:47.583 --> 00:19:49.948\nA lot of times you can see\nsomebody taking the time,\n\n398\n00:19:49.948 --> 00:19:53.028\nlike what Mike was showing us at\nthe very beginning of the episode,\n\n399\n00:19:53.028 --> 00:19:55.848\nmanually going through and\nsetting it up like it's a table.\n\n400\n00:19:55.848 --> 00:19:59.050\nBut then we're still missing those\nelements, like the drop downs that we were\n\n401\n00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:01.536\ntalking about, being able to\ncreate a total row right away.\n\n402\n00:20:01.536 --> 00:20:03.829\nBeing able to separate out the header and\n\n403\n00:20:03.829 --> 00:20:06.950\nthe footer are very easily\nin using those things.\n\n404\n00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:11.040\nSo considerable amount of power that\nwe're seeing right here with the use\n\n405\n00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:11.960\nof the tables.\n\n406\n00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.829\nBut remember, you can be tricked by just.\n\n407\n00:20:13.829 --> 00:20:15.500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Simple formatting.\n\n408\n00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.170\nAnd the only way that you can tell\nthe difference a lot of times is just\n\n409\n00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:19.090\nmaking sure.\n\n410\n00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:22.330\nCan the data that looks like\na table actually work like a table?\n\n411\n00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:22.980\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n412\n00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:26.500\nJust click in there and see if you\nget that contextual ribbon, right?\n\n413\n00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:29.840\nAnother one I'll show you, and again I\ntold you about those filter buttons.\n\n414\n00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.310\nI love those filter buttons,\nbut they do get in the way.\n\n415\n00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:34.630\nAnd I think they don't look nice, right?\n\n416\n00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:36.100\nWho cares how it looks?\n\n417\n00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:37.670\nI don't like the way it looks.\n\n418\n00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:40.950\nYou can turn them off simply by\nunchecking this Filter Button.\n\n419\n00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:44.980\nAny time you want to use them,\nyou can turn it back on, use them, and\n\n420\n00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:46.360\nthen turn it off.\n\n421\n00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:47.830\nSo that's nice as well.\n\n422\n00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:52.370\nSo we can remove tables, we can add\ntables, we can change those styles,\n\n423\n00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:54.030\nwe can remove the styles.\n\n424\n00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:56.480\nWe saw how to add that totals row and\n\n425\n00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:00.950\nreally handy because once it has that\ntotal row, any column that has data in it,\n\n426\n00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:04.500\nyou'll get a little drop down list and\nyou can pick a default formula, average,\n\n427\n00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:09.210\nmin, max, sum, standard deviation,\nthings like that.\n\n428\n00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:11.860\nFiltering records, we kinda saw that.\n\n429\n00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:16.850\nI can come over here and\nany one of these I can filter it.\n\n430\n00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:18.660\nWe can do text filters.\n\n431\n00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:20.628\nThere are the number filters, and\n\n432\n00:21:20.628 --> 00:21:24.000\nI think the one I didn't show you\nis sorting it on multiple columns.\n\n433\n00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.200\nI wanna sort this by hospital.\n\n434\n00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.510\nSo let me come over here to the company.\n\n435\n00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:30.070\nAnd I'm gonna choose sort A to Z.\n\n436\n00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:36.500\nAnd it looks like it actually did a pretty\ngood job of sorting that column as well.\n\n437\n00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.490\nProbably because I already\nhad it sorted by that.\n\n438\n00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:46.200\nLet me go ahead and change this,\nlet me sort by quantity, all right.\n\n439\n00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.850\nWell, let's just use.\n\n440\n00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:51.268\nOkay, I don't know what I did there.\n\n441\n00:21:51.268 --> 00:21:53.537\n[COUGH] It didn't like something I did,\n\n442\n00:21:53.537 --> 00:21:56.850\nI might have had something\nelse selected when I did that.\n\n443\n00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:57.650\nLet's try that again.\n\n444\n00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:59.620\nSmallest to largest.\n\n445\n00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:03.600\n[INAUDIBLE] It's telling me there are one\nor more circular references where\n\n446\n00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.520\na formula refers to its own cell\neither directly or indirectly.\n\n447\n00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:07.910\nYou know what it is?\n\n448\n00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:09.340\nI got that darn totals row down there and\n\n449\n00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.970\nit's trying to sort that along with,\nI bet.\n\n450\n00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:13.141\nLet's turn that off.\n\n451\n00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.060\nOr it's trying to grab that.\n\n452\n00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:18.780\nNo, I got the totals row.\n\n453\n00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:20.460\nIt's trying to do the column header maybe.\n\n454\n00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:22.220\nThat's interesting.\n\n455\n00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:27.710\nNot sure what it's got going on there,\nwhy it's not liking that.\n\n456\n00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:30.003\nLet's sort it by UnitPrice.\n\n457\n00:22:30.003 --> 00:22:32.590\nThat works.\n\n458\n00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:36.830\nInterestingly enough, when you sort\nit like this, notice the formatting\n\n459\n00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:40.960\nkind of goofs up, the one place\ntables fall short in my opinion.\n\n460\n00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.910\nIf you're listening Microsoft,\nwhat the heck is up with that?\n\n461\n00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:48.740\nBecause now my formatting is not\ncorrect anymore, the way it sorted it.\n\n462\n00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:51.450\nYou can also do some more complex sorts.\n\n463\n00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:57.840\nFor that you got to come over to the,\nwait I get back in my table here.\n\n464\n00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:01.600\nI'm gonna undo that, I can't stand looking\nat it with the bands all incorrect there.\n\n465\n00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:04.520\nYou can do a more complex sort.\n\n466\n00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.480\nYou just have to go over\nto your home ribbon.\n\n467\n00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:10.585\nYou go to Sort and Filter and\nthen you can do a Custom Sort.\n\n468\n00:23:10.585 --> 00:23:13.380\nIn here I can sort by\nmore than one column.\n\n469\n00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:19.620\nAnd so I might say I wanna sort it by\nCompany, sort on the Value, sort A to Z.\n\n470\n00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:25.341\nBut then I can add another sort level,\nand I'm gonna go by Product,\n\n471\n00:23:25.341 --> 00:23:29.130\nand I'll, just to make sure we can see it,\nI'll go Z to A.\n\n472\n00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:32.450\n>> Now Mike, before you click, nevermind.\n\n473\n00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:35.060\nThat's fine,\nI was gonna say before you click OK,\n\n474\n00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:39.090\nI wanted to talk about this idea,\nbecause I know that when you talk about\n\n475\n00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:43.845\nsorting by multiple columns, people can\nget confused by the result that they see.\n\n476\n00:23:43.845 --> 00:23:44.461\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n477\n00:23:44.461 --> 00:23:47.727\na lot of times I know I've actually\ndone that thinking that hey,\n\n478\n00:23:47.727 --> 00:23:49.965\nI gonna sort by this column,\nthis column and\n\n479\n00:23:49.965 --> 00:23:52.828\nI look I'm like that's not\nwhat I was expecting to see.\n\n480\n00:23:52.828 --> 00:23:55.860\nSo can you talk about the process\nof how Excel actually says hey,\n\n481\n00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:57.107\nwe're gonna do the sort.\n\n482\n00:23:57.107 --> 00:24:00.134\n>> Yeah, when you use your\nlittle sort buttons up here or\n\n483\n00:24:00.134 --> 00:24:03.429\nif you do it off of the ribbon\nwith just your standard sort,\n\n484\n00:24:03.429 --> 00:24:06.619\nit's gonna sort by whatever\ncolumn you have selected.\n\n485\n00:24:06.619 --> 00:24:08.573\nIf you go to another column and sort it,\n\n486\n00:24:08.573 --> 00:24:13.060\nwell it forgets the first sort that it did\nand it sorts it by that second column.\n\n487\n00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:15.240\nSo if you want to sort\nit by multiple columns,\n\n488\n00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:19.220\nin other words I want all the Florida\nhospitals to be together, but\n\n489\n00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:21.640\nthere are several records for\nFlorida hospitals.\n\n490\n00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:26.330\nAnd you want all the drugs\nlisted together, and\n\n491\n00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:28.630\nlet me do it A to Z, and\nI'll show what I mean here.\n\n492\n00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:33.164\nDo a custom sort, by product, A to Z.\n\n493\n00:24:33.164 --> 00:24:37.799\nAnd I'm gonna add a third level on that.\n\n494\n00:24:37.799 --> 00:24:40.910\nWe'll do quantity and smallest to largest.\n\n495\n00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:42.900\nAnd I'll click OK.\n\n496\n00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:46.970\nSo what it's doing if you notice,\nfirst, it sorts by company.\n\n497\n00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:48.080\nSo as I scroll through here,\n\n498\n00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.870\nit's Florida Hospital all the way\nto Memorial there, right?\n\n499\n00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:53.420\nSo that was the first sort.\n\n500\n00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:58.687\nThen it said within Florida Hospital, just\nlooking at these first 50 something rows,\n\n501\n00:24:58.687 --> 00:25:02.850\nright, whatever Florida\nhospital ended here, 55.\n\n502\n00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:04.740\nSort it by product.\n\n503\n00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:10.501\nNotice the product goes from A, Down to Z.\n\n504\n00:25:10.501 --> 00:25:14.660\nBut then it starts over with\nMemorial Hospital A to Z.\n\n505\n00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.280\nSo you're sorting it by the column.\n\n506\n00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.400\nIn this case, the hospital first.\n\n507\n00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.630\nThat sorting doesn't go away,\nthen it's sub sorting basically.\n\n508\n00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:25.310\nIt's taking that group that it\ncreated by sorting it by hospital and\n\n509\n00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:27.070\nit's sorting it within that.\n\n510\n00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:32.260\nAnd then if there's multiples of\na particular one, like Lorazepam here,\n\n511\n00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:36.550\nI then sorted it by,\nwhat did I do, quantity, right?\n\n512\n00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:42.450\nSo there's an order for lorazepam for 18\nand then 23, and then 24, and then 34, 95.\n\n513\n00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:47.360\nSo again, you've created a second\ngrouping by product and then you're gonna\n\n514\n00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:51.320\nsort within that second grouping,\nyou're gonna sort it by quantity.\n\n515\n00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:52.252\nHopefully, does that clear it up?\n\n516\n00:25:52.252 --> 00:25:53.030\nDoes that make sense?\n\n517\n00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:53.843\n>> Yeah, it really does.\n\n518\n00:25:53.843 --> 00:25:57.154\nIt allows us to be able to understand that\nwhat we do have when we pick multiple\n\n519\n00:25:57.154 --> 00:26:00.310\ncolumns, right, is that we understand\nthat the first one that we pick,\n\n520\n00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:02.017\nit's gonna go through and sort it, and\n\n521\n00:26:02.017 --> 00:26:06.160\nthen it's gonna take advantage and look at\nthe second one as it sorts it from there.\n\n522\n00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:10.560\nSometimes what you may actually expect, I\nknow logically I know what I was thinking,\n\n523\n00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:14.270\nis that I would actually sort from\nA to Z on the first column, but\n\n524\n00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:17.840\nthen I would accidentally sort\ndescending on the second column.\n\n525\n00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:20.850\nAnd I would still think,\nno, no, that's not right.\n\n526\n00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:23.390\nAnd what you see in the result\nis not what you expect.\n\n527\n00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:24.750\nSo sometimes you gotta remember that.\n\n528\n00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:26.540\nThat it always actually\nfollows that pattern.\n\n529\n00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:30.130\nWhatever the first one is, it goes\nthrough sorts everything first there, and\n\n530\n00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:31.150\nthen it comes back around and\n\n531\n00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:34.970\ntakes whatever the second one that you\nactually made and sort by that, too.\n\n532\n00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:36.430\nThe reason why that's important, right,\n\n533\n00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:39.680\nis because it does matter\nhow you present the data.\n\n534\n00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.100\nIf somebody is asking, hey,\n\n535\n00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:46.420\nI wanna see who actually sold the most\nproducts here in descending order,\n\n536\n00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:49.935\nwell, then, you actually have to\nmake sure that you can show that.\n\n537\n00:26:49.935 --> 00:26:54.060\nIt's much different if Mike were\ninstead to pick the drug and\n\n538\n00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:57.180\nsort by that one first, and\nthen find out what customer he ordered,\n\n539\n00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:01.190\nrather than what customer actually ordered\nwhat drugs that are actually there.\n\n540\n00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:05.640\nAnd so you do need to understand that that\nsorting can kinda throw you a little bit\n\n541\n00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.270\nif you don't understand how it does it.\n\n542\n00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:09.100\n>> Absolutely.\nIn fact, that's a great example.\n\n543\n00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:11.330\nLet's take a look at my data again here.\n\n544\n00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:14.990\nI did hospital first,\nthen product, then quantity.\n\n545\n00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:17.976\nLet's go ahead and\nclear those sorts out of here.\n\n546\n00:27:17.976 --> 00:27:20.472\nWe're gonna clear all those filters.\n\n547\n00:27:20.472 --> 00:27:24.826\nAnd this time, what I wanna do is I'm\ngonna do another custom sort, but\n\n548\n00:27:24.826 --> 00:27:27.870\nI'm gonna sort it by product first.\n\n549\n00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:31.060\nSo I'll go product, values A to Z.\n\n550\n00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:33.810\nAnd then I'm gonna add\nanother level within that.\n\n551\n00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:37.870\nI'm gonna go company A to Z, and\nlet's see what the different result is.\n\n552\n00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:38.570\nI'll click OK.\n\n553\n00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:44.780\nAnd now we go back up the top,\nI can see that it's sorted by drug first,\n\n554\n00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:46.590\nor product, and then by hospital.\n\n555\n00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:48.240\nLet's find one that has more than one.\n\n556\n00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:54.370\nSo here's all my orders for whatever\nthat is, Alprazolam that's a good one.\n\n557\n00:27:54.370 --> 00:27:57.910\nAnd then within that group Florida\nhospitals are all together,\n\n558\n00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:02.652\nSaint Joseph's ordered it twice, Tampa\nGeneral once and Tampa Shriners once.\n\n559\n00:28:02.652 --> 00:28:06.905\nWe go down to the next grouping of\nproduct and you see Memorial ordered one.\n\n560\n00:28:06.905 --> 00:28:12.320\nYou see how it's sorted by hospital,\nso that all the Tampa Generals\n\n561\n00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:16.789\nthat ordered Amitriptyline\nare all together, right?\n\n562\n00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:19.991\nI could have picked a different topic,\nand not done drug names that\n\n563\n00:28:19.991 --> 00:28:22.750\nI can't pronounce, but hey,\nwhere's the fun in that?\n\n564\n00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:24.069\nSo yeah,\nyou play around with your sorting.\n\n565\n00:28:24.069 --> 00:28:27.586\nYou can quickly and\neasily clear all those sorts out.\n\n566\n00:28:27.586 --> 00:28:29.607\nWe just go to clear.\n\n567\n00:28:29.607 --> 00:28:33.454\nAnd, let's see,\nif we go back to custom sort, oops,\n\n568\n00:28:33.454 --> 00:28:37.733\nI'm not clicked within my table,\nso let's try that again.\n\n569\n00:28:37.733 --> 00:28:41.757\nI can go and undo that filter and\ngo back to custom sort, and\n\n570\n00:28:41.757 --> 00:28:44.440\nyou'll see all my sorts are gone.\n\n571\n00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:48.460\nNow when you remove your sorting,\nit doesn't scramble the data.\n\n572\n00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:51.220\nRight, so in the background, you're\nsaying, well, Mike, it's still sorted.\n\n573\n00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:54.180\nWell just because you remove the sort,\nit's not gonna go haha,\n\n574\n00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:56.850\nlet's roll the dice and scramble it up.\n\n575\n00:28:56.850 --> 00:28:58.220\nIt kinda stays that way.\n\n576\n00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:01.230\nBut I can always come in and\nadd a different sort.\n\n577\n00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:03.950\nAnd we're back to however\nwe want it there.\n\n578\n00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:06.080\nSo lots of cool things\nyou can do with that.\n\n579\n00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.810\nLast thing I wanna talk about\nis removing duplicates.\n\n580\n00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:12.620\nThis is another thing that we\nsometimes find ourselves having to do,\n\n581\n00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:14.910\nand that's remove duplicate values.\n\n582\n00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:18.180\nEither because we're merging two different\ndata sources and they've got some values\n\n583\n00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:23.060\nthat are duplicated, or somebody has done\ndata entry and they just went to lunch,\n\n584\n00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:27.230\ncome back, forgot where they left off, and\nthey start typing in the same data again.\n\n585\n00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:31.150\nOr maybe you're just looking for\nunique sales of a particular drug.\n\n586\n00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:35.308\nI don't care that Florida Hospital ordered\nthis particular medicine 5 times or\n\n587\n00:29:35.308 --> 00:29:37.190\n10 times or 20 times.\n\n588\n00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:39.310\nI wanna see which hospitals\nordered this medicine.\n\n589\n00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:41.540\nDon't care how many times\nthey actually ordered it.\n\n590\n00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:44.030\nSo you can go through and\nremove duplicates.\n\n591\n00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:45.110\nDo be careful with this though,\n\n592\n00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:48.400\ncuz that last example I said\nis not really a filter.\n\n593\n00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.330\nYou are going to remove the records.\n\n594\n00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:54.510\nSo you might wanna make a copy of\nyour data and do something like that.\n\n595\n00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:57.250\nAll right, but\nit's pretty straightforward here.\n\n596\n00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:00.560\nThere's just a remove duplicates button,\nand\n\n597\n00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:04.460\nhere I can see, tell it has header so\nI'm not gonna remove that.\n\n598\n00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:09.600\nAnd I'll just remove any duplicates by,\nI'm gonna say any\n\n599\n00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:15.572\ntime they order the same, notice what I'm\ndoing, there's all my columns, right.\n\n600\n00:30:15.572 --> 00:30:19.170\nI'm saying if the company,\nand the product and\n\n601\n00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:23.540\nthe quantity are all the same, there's\na good chance that's a duplicate record.\n\n602\n00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:27.450\nNow again, I wouldn't play with my data\nlike this and say, there's a good chance.\n\n603\n00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:32.080\nBut if you know for sure, right, that\nthere's no way there should be more than\n\n604\n00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:35.090\none record for the company and\nthe product and the date.\n\n605\n00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:39.040\nThat would be a good one to do,\nyou know if the date was the same.\n\n606\n00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:43.220\nSo they ordered the same product, the same\namount of the product, on the same day.\n\n607\n00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:45.590\nTheres no way there\nshould be two of those.\n\n608\n00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:49.280\nSo we click OK, and\nwe'll see it doesn't find any duplicates.\n\n609\n00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.000\nSo hey I'm good,\n\n610\n00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.120\nI can, now I know that nobody's\nentered that data in more than once.\n\n611\n00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:58.150\nIf there were duplicates, and I'll\nshow you what happens when you do find\n\n612\n00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:02.833\nduplicates, I'm gonna unselect all and\ndo company and product and we'll click OK.\n\n613\n00:31:02.833 --> 00:31:09.160\nAnd it says 65 duplicates found and\nremoved 186 unique values remain.\n\n614\n00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:13.935\nBut notice what it said, now it's\nreally mad at one of my formulas there,\n\n615\n00:31:13.935 --> 00:31:17.260\nis it removed them,\nI didn't get a second chance.\n\n616\n00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:20.150\nI didn't get a wait, no,\nI don't wanna do that.\n\n617\n00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:23.900\nAll right, it just said, all right, I'm\ngonna remove the duplicates here we go.\n\n618\n00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:25.500\nSo be careful with that one.\n\n619\n00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:30.450\nCmd+Z or Ctrl+Z, depending on what\nOS you're running, is your friend.\n\n620\n00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:33.210\nYou can get those records\nback before you close this.\n\n621\n00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:35.100\nA lot of cool things you\ncan do at tables and\n\n622\n00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:38.400\nthey'll come in to play later on\nwhen we get into formulas as well.\n\n623\n00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.640\n>> And there's no doubt that tables are by\nfar one of the most powerful ways that we\n\n624\n00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:45.120\ncan also use it to manipulate\nthe data that we find within Excel.\n\n625\n00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:48.680\nRemember what Mike showed us here,\nthe ability to create table\n\n626\n00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:52.050\nalso gives us access to those\ntools that we can do the totals.\n\n627\n00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:55.540\nWe can do the sorting and logically\nhave all that data grouped together,\n\n628\n00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:57.860\nwithout you and\nI having to manually do it.\n\n629\n00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:01.150\nThen once we actually have that\nwe can take that table data,\n\n630\n00:32:01.150 --> 00:32:05.180\nregardless of whether it's 10 rows or\n1,000 rows, and\n\n631\n00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:09.310\nformat it all at one time and\nonly effect that data set, as well.\n\n632\n00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:13.110\nIt really is a powerful tool\nthat we should know how to use,\n\n633\n00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:16.730\nknow how to actually use it effectively,\nand by being able to actually do that,\n\n634\n00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:19.490\nwe're going to actually be able to\nmanipulate our data much more efficiently.\n\n635\n00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:21.120\nMike, any other last words here?\n\n636\n00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.080\n>> One parting word I\nwanna share with you guys.\n\n637\n00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:26.180\nRemember I told you, and I said if\nMicrosoft's listening, please fix this.\n\n638\n00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:29.540\nWhen you sort it,\nyour formatting doesn't sort properly.\n\n639\n00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:31.150\nOr it really goofs things up.\n\n640\n00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:33.500\nSo if we look at my spreadsheet\nit kinda looks ugly.\n\n641\n00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:34.880\nReal quick easy fix for\n\n642\n00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:39.220\nyou guys out there, remove your table,\nconvert it back to a range.\n\n643\n00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:44.630\nOnce you've sorted it and everything's\nall wrong, you just remove the table and\n\n644\n00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:47.465\nthen you can just clear\nyour formatting altogether.\n\n645\n00:32:47.465 --> 00:32:52.241\nWoo, whoops, good thing I have that Cmd+Z,\nyeah [CROSSTALK].\n\n646\n00:32:52.241 --> 00:32:57.203\nLet's do that again, clear formats and\nthen just insert the table again.\n\n647\n00:32:57.203 --> 00:33:02.416\nInsert > Table, and OK,\nand we're back to normal.\n\n648\n00:33:02.416 --> 00:33:04.924\nThe only thing you'll wanna worry\nabout there is that it does change\n\n649\n00:33:04.924 --> 00:33:05.770\nthe name of the table.\n\n650\n00:33:05.770 --> 00:33:06.620\nIf you've given it a name,\n\n651\n00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:09.560\nyou're gonna have to re-name that\ntable back to what it use to be.\n\n652\n00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:11.310\nJust a quick little tip.\n\n653\n00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:13.789\n>> All right, well that's a great\nplace for us to go ahead and\n\n654\n00:33:13.789 --> 00:33:15.130\nend this episode then.\n\n655\n00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:17.070\nSigning off for ITProTV.\n\n656\n00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:17.696\nI'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n657\n00:33:17.696 --> 00:33:18.695\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n658\n00:33:18.695 --> 00:33:20.239\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n659\n00:33:20.239 --> 00:33:28.320\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:21.110\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today we're\ntaking a look at Microsoft Excel 2016.\n\n4\n00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.870\nNow, we're specifically going to be taking\na look at getting ready to use formulas.\n\n5\n00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.020\nAnd who better to help us to get started\nhere is gonna be Mr. Mike Rodrick?\n\n6\n00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.010\nMike, how's it going?\n\n7\n00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.890\n>> It's going great, Ronnie.\n\n8\n00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.610\nWe are getting into the good stuff now,\nright?\n\n9\n00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.310\nWe're really starting to\npull the power of Excel out.\n\n10\n00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.530\nWhen we start talking about formulas and\nfunctions, right?\n\n11\n00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.690\nSo, well, we'll dive right in, I guess.\n\n12\n00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.750\nFirst, before I jump into my worksheet and\nwe start looking at it.\n\n13\n00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.880\nLet me differentiate because you\nhear people talk about functions,\n\n14\n00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.310\nyou'll hear people talk about formulas and\nwhat's the difference, right?\n\n15\n00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.610\nWell really a formula is one that you\nwould write yourself, like if you say\n\n16\n00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.900\nif you wanna add up cells a1 and a2,\nyou could say equals a1 plus a2.\n\n17\n00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.160\nAll right, that's a formula.\n\n18\n00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.940\nYou're going to write everything out.\n\n19\n00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.690\nJust think about the old\nmath formulas you wrote.\n\n20\n00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.900\nFour plus three times two to\nthe power of four, that's a formula.\n\n21\n00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.080\nA function is a built-in formula,\n\n22\n00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.500\nbasically, where it knows what\nmathematical calculation you want to do.\n\n23\n00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.220\nYou just have to tell it what\ncells you want to do it on.\n\n24\n00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.040\nSo take that same one,\nI want to add a1 and a2.\n\n25\n00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.170\nI could do that two ways.\n\n26\n00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:40.460\nI could say equals a1 plus a2 or\nI could say equals SUM.\n\n27\n00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.420\nThat's my function.\n\n28\n00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.220\nOpen parentheses a1 comma\na2 close parentheses.\n\n29\n00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.940\nIn the end I'm gonna get the same result.\n\n30\n00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.500\nBut depending on what I'm doing,\none can be easier than the other.\n\n31\n00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.860\nIt really is one of those things that you\nhave to look at each situation differently\n\n32\n00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.510\nand decide what's easier,\nwrite my own formula or\n\n33\n00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.620\nuse one of those built-in functions?\n\n34\n00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.500\nThere's an average function, for example.\n\n35\n00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.030\nWe know how to make an average,\n\n36\n00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.160\nadd all your numbers up, divide that\nnumber that you get, that total,\n\n37\n00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.050\nby the number of numbers that you added\ntogether to get an average, right?\n\n38\n00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.840\nAnd we can do that\nmathematically with a formula.\n\n39\n00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.240\nI could say a plus b plus c plus d\ndivided by 4, I'd get an average.\n\n40\n00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.580\nOr I could do average open parentheses,\nabcd, closed parentheses, and\n\n41\n00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.870\nI don't have to worry about telling it,\nhey, divide this by 4.\n\n42\n00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.350\nIt knows that whatever that total is,\nI'm going to figure out an average by\n\n43\n00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.546\ndividing it by the number of integers,\nor values I see in that parentheses.\n\n44\n00:02:34.546 --> 00:02:39.720\n>> Now, Mike, we had mentioned earlier\nin an episode that we had a friend\n\n45\n00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.270\nthat literally typed numbers inside\nof Excel and then took a calculator\n\n46\n00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.900\nto be able to add those numbers up and\nenter a value into another cell for us.\n\n47\n00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.280\nAnd, I hate to say it,\nwhen it comes down to Excel,\n\n48\n00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.170\na lot of times people begin with that if\nthey haven't actually studied it at all or\n\n49\n00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.070\nunderstand a little bit about Excel.\n\n50\n00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.780\nSo, if I wanted to add up two numbers\ninside of Excel, I can do that math!\n\n51\n00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.330\nWe know that we can take a calculator and\n\n52\n00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.800\ndo that but there's a reason why we\nshouldn't do it that way, isn't there.\n\n53\n00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.050\n>> Yeah, cuz Excel is dynamic, right?\n\n54\n00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.900\nIf those values change it's going\nto change your total for you.\n\n55\n00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.150\nWe don't have to go back and\nrecalculate those numbers.\n\n56\n00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.270\nIf I use a calculator,\nadd the numbers up and\n\n57\n00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.040\nthen type the value in there, what if\none of those sales numbers changes?\n\n58\n00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.540\nBut my total is not\ngoing to change anymore.\n\n59\n00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.490\nWhereas when you do\na formula you're saying hey,\n\n60\n00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.060\nlook at this cell, add it to this cell and\nadd it to this cell.\n\n61\n00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.210\nIt doesn't matter what those values are,\nthey could change.\n\n62\n00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.670\nThe formula will still work, right?\n\n63\n00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.675\nBut if you had statically\ntyped in the answer,\n\n64\n00:03:40.675 --> 00:03:42.620\nthat's not going to update automatically.\n\n65\n00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.330\nSo let's take a look here, I guess Ronnie\nfirst at writing a couple simple ones and\n\n66\n00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.275\nwe need to understand the way\nExcel functions in the background\n\n67\n00:03:52.275 --> 00:03:53.905\na little bit as well.\n\n68\n00:03:53.905 --> 00:03:56.005\nSo let's start, I've got a sheet here and\n\n69\n00:03:56.005 --> 00:03:59.915\nI've simply created a few\ncells with some numbers in it.\n\n70\n00:03:59.915 --> 00:04:04.045\nAnd the first thing we have to know,\nall formulas, and functions for\n\n71\n00:04:04.045 --> 00:04:06.555\nthat matter,\nstart with an equal sign, right?\n\n72\n00:04:06.555 --> 00:04:10.950\nIf I just type 4+2 and hit Enter.\n\n73\n00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.480\nExcel's not gonna do anything\nexcept display 4+2, right?\n\n74\n00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.880\nIf I say =4+2,\nExcel says that's six, right?\n\n75\n00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.670\nAnd remember when we talked about\ndisplayed value versus actual content, or\n\n76\n00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.120\ndisplayed content versus actual content.\n\n77\n00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.140\nThe cell holds the number six or\nso it looks like.\n\n78\n00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.780\nBut if you look up here,\nthis is what's actually in the cell,\n\n79\n00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.950\nthis formula that I've written right here.\n\n80\n00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.320\nWhen I go away from that cell you\ncan see it calculates it out and\n\n81\n00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.990\nit gives me the answer.\n\n82\n00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.330\nSo all formulas, functions are going\nto start with an equals sign.\n\n83\n00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.907\nNow let's say I want to add up these\nnumbers right here, 5, 10, 15, and 20.\n\n84\n00:04:51.907 --> 00:04:53.770\nThere's a couple different\nways we can do this.\n\n85\n00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.910\nWe're gonna start with simple\nformulas we'll get into functions\n\n86\n00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.390\nin some later episodes.\n\n87\n00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.240\nSo I'm gonna say equals, oops,\nthat's not an equals sign.\n\n88\n00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.050\nEquals and now I can do a couple\nof different ways here.\n\n89\n00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.727\nI can say equals, this is cell c4.\n\n90\n00:05:11.727 --> 00:05:16.600\nSo I can type in c4,\nI can use that cell reference.\n\n91\n00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.960\nAnd you can see it draws\na box around that cell.\n\n92\n00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.102\nPlus, c, sorry, not c, but let's do d4\n\n93\n00:05:25.102 --> 00:05:30.991\nplus e4 plus\n\n94\n00:05:30.991 --> 00:05:36.540\nf4, and I'll hit Enter, and\nthere's my total, right?\n\n95\n00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.390\nSo I'm just adding up those cells there.\n\n96\n00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.760\nThat's one way to do it, is actually\ntype them out another way that you could\n\n97\n00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.130\ndo that, and let me undo that guy there.\n\n98\n00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.680\nI could say equals, and\n\n99\n00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.940\nI could just select the cell, plus and\nI can click on the next cell,\n\n100\n00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.670\nplus click on the next cell,\nplus click on the next cell hit Enter.\n\n101\n00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.380\nAnd I get the same result, all right.\n\n102\n00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:02.390\nIt's just how do you wanna do it.\n\n103\n00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.400\nDo you want to type it out,\nwould you rather click on it,\n\n104\n00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.530\nyou can do it either way and\nyou end up with the same results.\n\n105\n00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.594\nNow, so, creating that formula is\npretty straightforward, right?\n\n106\n00:06:14.594 --> 00:06:18.320\nI just wanna add those together so,\nuse my basic math symbols, my plus sign.\n\n107\n00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.624\nIf I wanted to multiply\nthem I will simply do\n\n108\n00:06:22.624 --> 00:06:27.170\nequals which cell and then times, right?\n\n109\n00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.010\nIn Excel, the splat or asterisk or\n\n110\n00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:34.030\nthe star whatever you wanna call that\nis gonna be your multiplication symbol.\n\n111\n00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:39.350\nSelect your second cell, hit enter and\nI get 5 times 10 is 50 right?\n\n112\n00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.240\nSo, pretty straightforward there,\nuse your cell references.\n\n113\n00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.280\nHere's where formulas start\nto get a little bit trickier.\n\n114\n00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.190\nAt least you have to pay attention\nwhen I start moving these guys around.\n\n115\n00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:54.370\nNow if, let's say if I wanted\nto move this over underneath,\n\n116\n00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.610\nwell actually let's just say I\nwant to move it over one cell.\n\n117\n00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:03.080\nIf I go to the border of this cell,\nI get my move symbol,\n\n118\n00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.200\nI can click and drag and\nmove that over here, and nothing changed.\n\n119\n00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.280\nIt still says 50.\n\n120\n00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:14.760\nBecause it's still c4 plus d4, where\nthe sum or where answer is doesn't matter,\n\n121\n00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:20.910\nit's still multiplying this\ncell times this cell, right?\n\n122\n00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:23.350\nIf I start trying to do\na series fill though, and\n\n123\n00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.540\nlet's do it a little bit differently here,\nlet's change this up.\n\n124\n00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.620\nLet's go ahead and add,\nlet's add these numbers.\n\n125\n00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:36.509\nWe're gonna say plus this guy plus this\n\n126\n00:07:36.509 --> 00:07:41.510\nguy plus, we'll just do three.\n\n127\n00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:45.120\nNow what if I wanted to do the same\nthing for these cells here?\n\n128\n00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:51.955\nIf I drag this down, like this, and\ndo series fill, it works out, all right?\n\n129\n00:07:51.955 --> 00:07:53.985\nNotice it's not 30 four times, all right?\n\n130\n00:07:55.295 --> 00:08:00.259\nBecause what happens is you see\nthe formula c4+d4+e4 when I did\n\n131\n00:08:00.259 --> 00:08:04.365\nthe series fill and\nmoved it down one notice it changed.\n\n132\n00:08:04.365 --> 00:08:05.805\nAnd let's do, we can do this.\n\n133\n00:08:05.805 --> 00:08:10.205\nSee which numbers it's adding up?\n\n134\n00:08:10.205 --> 00:08:12.318\nAnd look at this one.\n\n135\n00:08:12.318 --> 00:08:17.277\nI moved the formula down, or should say\nI copied the formula down one cell, so\n\n136\n00:08:17.277 --> 00:08:21.091\nExcel said wait a second,\nif you move the formula down one,\n\n137\n00:08:21.091 --> 00:08:26.440\nI'm gonna move the numbers that your\nadding together down one, right.\n\n138\n00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.858\nIf we take a look at the next one,\n\n139\n00:08:27.858 --> 00:08:31.460\nnotice which one's it's adding up,\nagain, cuz I moved it down one.\n\n140\n00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.230\nThis one is doing those.\n\n141\n00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:34.280\nWhat if I did it one more?\n\n142\n00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:36.640\nI get a big fat 0.\n\n143\n00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:37.600\nWhy?\n\n144\n00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:42.780\nWell because it moved those boxes down one\nand there's no numbers there, all right.\n\n145\n00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:46.070\nSo what this is by default\nExcel uses something called\n\n146\n00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:48.750\na relative reference, right.\n\n147\n00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:53.925\nThe cells that I'm adding up are related\nto the where the summary is or\n\n148\n00:08:53.925 --> 00:08:55.605\nwhere that formula is.\n\n149\n00:08:55.605 --> 00:08:59.265\nSo if the formula moves down,\nthe numbers I'm adding up moves down, or\n\n150\n00:08:59.265 --> 00:09:01.205\nthe cells I'm using to add up.\n\n151\n00:09:01.205 --> 00:09:04.755\nIf I move this over, what's gonna happen?\n\n152\n00:09:04.755 --> 00:09:09.100\nWell, I moved my formula over one,\nso that means the cells,\n\n153\n00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:13.740\nif you see here's my original formula,\n5, 10, and 15 are being added together.\n\n154\n00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.370\nI moved it over one, and now look.\n\n155\n00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:20.000\n10, 15, and\n20 are being added together, right?\n\n156\n00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.310\nFormula moved over one to the right,\n\n157\n00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:25.570\nthe numbers that I'm adding\nup moved over to the right.\n\n158\n00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:27.140\nSo sometimes that's a good thing.\n\n159\n00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:32.994\nWhen we did that first series fill,\nall right, before we had these guys.\n\n160\n00:09:32.994 --> 00:09:34.782\nAll right, clear that out.\n\n161\n00:09:34.782 --> 00:09:37.400\nI didn't have to rewrite that formula.\n\n162\n00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.430\nI didn't have to come over here and\nsay, equals this guy, plus this guy,\n\n163\n00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:42.080\nplus this guy.\n\n164\n00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.050\nI can just take that formula series fill,\nand\n\n165\n00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:49.520\nbecause of the relative nature\nof those references, it said,\n\n166\n00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.330\nhey you moved the formula down,\nI'm gonna adjust the numbers I get.\n\n167\n00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:54.170\nSo it makes it very easy.\n\n168\n00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:58.780\nWhere it becomes difficult is\nwhen I start moving that formula\n\n169\n00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.800\nin a way that doesn't\ncoincide with the data.\n\n170\n00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.940\nLet's say I wanted to move this summary,\nlet's move this summary here.\n\n171\n00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.982\nLet's put that guy up there.\n\n172\n00:10:09.982 --> 00:10:14.110\nAll right, I want to move these formulas\nup here underneath the summary.\n\n173\n00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:18.185\nSo I'm thinking okay, I'll just take\nthem and move them up over there.\n\n174\n00:10:18.185 --> 00:10:23.605\nAnd notice that worked just fine because,\nwhy did that work actually?\n\n175\n00:10:23.605 --> 00:10:27.030\n[LAUGH] Usually a lot of times\nthat will not work for you.\n\n176\n00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:28.741\nExcel is trying to help me out there.\n\n177\n00:10:28.741 --> 00:10:33.637\nWatch what happens if I copy this guy,\nand paste this guy.\n\n178\n00:10:33.637 --> 00:10:37.583\nAll of a sudden it doesn't work,\nbecause look at the numbers here,\n\n179\n00:10:37.583 --> 00:10:40.265\nI'm adding up these three cells.\n\n180\n00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:43.269\nWhen I move that formula up to and\nover four, so\n\n181\n00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:45.744\nlook what numbers this guy's doing.\n\n182\n00:10:45.744 --> 00:10:49.076\nUp two and over four, see what i'm saying?\n\n183\n00:10:49.076 --> 00:10:53.218\nAnd again, this is one of those concepts\nthat's kind of hard to verbalize,\n\n184\n00:10:53.218 --> 00:10:57.740\nit's easier I think, visually hope\nyou guys are seeing what I'm doing.\n\n185\n00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:02.510\nNow what if I wanted to be\nable to move this around, but\n\n186\n00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:06.880\nnot change the numbers that Excel\nwas actually calculating on?\n\n187\n00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.740\nIn that case we have to change\nthat relative reference, and\n\n188\n00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.870\nit's actually very easy to do.\n\n189\n00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:14.450\nIt's a dollar sign.\n\n190\n00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:19.600\nA dollar sign is gonna tell Excel,\ndon't change this reference.\n\n191\n00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.680\nEvery cell reference has two parts to it.\n\n192\n00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:26.380\nA column, and a row, all right.\n\n193\n00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:31.993\nIf I put a dollar sign in front\nof that column referenced there,\n\n194\n00:11:31.993 --> 00:11:38.641\nwhen I move this guy, And\nI'll paste it over here again.\n\n195\n00:11:38.641 --> 00:11:39.860\nAll right.\n\n196\n00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:42.055\nNotice the C didn't change.\n\n197\n00:11:42.055 --> 00:11:45.021\nEverything else did, but the C did not.\n\n198\n00:11:45.021 --> 00:11:51.624\nThis was C4, D4, and E4,\nit's now C2, H2 and E2, or I2.\n\n199\n00:11:51.624 --> 00:11:54.800\nCuz it moved up two, and\nover four, all right?\n\n200\n00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:58.340\nBut that C didn't change\nlike the rest of them.\n\n201\n00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:01.480\nSee how it moved up two, but\nit didn't move over four?\n\n202\n00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.025\nCuz it said don't change that C.\n\n203\n00:12:04.025 --> 00:12:08.580\nAnd so if I wanted to fix it so\nit didn't move that cell at all,\n\n204\n00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:11.940\nI can put a dollar sign for\nthe row reference as well.\n\n205\n00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:16.930\nNow I have dollar sign C, dollar sign\nfour, I'm saying don't change the C.\n\n206\n00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:19.050\nNo matter where this formula goes,\n\n207\n00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:23.040\ndon't change the C that column\nreference remains the same.\n\n208\n00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:28.120\nDon't change the four, that row reference\nshould not change, at least for this one.\n\n209\n00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.730\nThe other two will change,\n\n210\n00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:34.020\nbecause those are still listed as\nrelative references, all right.\n\n211\n00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.750\nSo now, hit Enter.\n\n212\n00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:40.610\nI'll take that formula,\nI'll copy it and I'll paste it, and\n\n213\n00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:42.890\nwe'll look at what numbers it's choosing.\n\n214\n00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:46.980\nAnd notice these two moved,\nbecause they are relative,\n\n215\n00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:50.800\nthis one did not, because of\nthe dollar signs that are in there.\n\n216\n00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.220\nSo you can make the column\nreference absolute.\n\n217\n00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:59.170\nYou can make the row reference absolute,\nor you can do both the column and the row.\n\n218\n00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:02.373\nFor the exam preppers out there,\nthey'll call that a mixed.\n\n219\n00:13:02.373 --> 00:13:04.853\nYou got relative references, like C2.\n\n220\n00:13:04.853 --> 00:13:09.708\nYou've got mixed references $C2.\n\n221\n00:13:09.708 --> 00:13:12.308\nColumn is absolute, row is relative.\n\n222\n00:13:12.308 --> 00:13:17.693\nOr C$2, column is relative,\nrow is absolute.\n\n223\n00:13:17.693 --> 00:13:21.580\nOr you have an absolute reference where\nboth the column are absolute $C$2.\n\n224\n00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:26.760\nShow you another handy\nlittle trick that I love,\n\n225\n00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.400\nis to be able to change these references.\n\n226\n00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.853\nHere I typed in the dollar sign,\nI dot both times.\n\n227\n00:13:34.853 --> 00:13:37.835\nHere I'm just gonna\nselect that reference or\n\n228\n00:13:37.835 --> 00:13:42.940\njust put my cursor somewhere in that\nD4 reference, and I'm gonna do an F4.\n\n229\n00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.363\nAnd watch what it does.\n\n230\n00:13:44.363 --> 00:13:49.198\nI hit F4 on my keyboard,\nand it changed it to $D$4.\n\n231\n00:13:49.198 --> 00:13:52.834\nI hit F4 again, D$4.\n\n232\n00:13:52.834 --> 00:13:55.900\nF4 again, $D4.\n\n233\n00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:59.830\nF4 again, no absolute, all relative.\n\n234\n00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:03.602\nSo you can cycle through\nall the possibilities,\n\n235\n00:14:03.602 --> 00:14:07.194\nby just hitting your F4\nkey on your keyboard.\n\n236\n00:14:07.194 --> 00:14:11.129\nSo a handy little trick to be\nable to create those relative and\n\n237\n00:14:11.129 --> 00:14:12.679\nabsolute references.\n\n238\n00:14:12.679 --> 00:14:15.115\n>> Now Mike,\nto help us set this up a little bit more,\n\n239\n00:14:15.115 --> 00:14:19.440\na lot of times people may not understand\nwhere we would actually end up using this.\n\n240\n00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.550\nSo what you may end up seeing,\nlet's say for an example that on Mike's\n\n241\n00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:26.660\nlittle table there, what he ends up having\nare different salespeople that are also of\n\n242\n00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:29.510\ncourse, working at\nthe same commission rate.\n\n243\n00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:31.930\nAnd even though you're\nmoving that formula down,\n\n244\n00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:34.920\nthe commission rate is actually\nstored in one location.\n\n245\n00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.320\nBeing able to provide that\nabsolute reference for\n\n246\n00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:41.670\nthat commission, allows you then to\nconstantly refer back to that one cell,\n\n247\n00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:43.950\njust like what Mike showed us,\nthat didn't move, but\n\n248\n00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:47.520\nstill allow that formula to move and\ncalculate the values that we need to.\n\n249\n00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.800\nSo learning about the relative reference,\n\n250\n00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.970\nunderstanding what may happen a lot of\ntimes when you do move those formulas.\n\n251\n00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:57.420\nAnd you may get errors and\nnot just different values sometimes,\n\n252\n00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:01.330\nthat you may have to go back and check and\nverify, hey, are these the cells that I'm\n\n253\n00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.460\nadding together or multiplying together,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n254\n00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:08.250\nAnd if all of a sudden you start\nmultiplying it by a relative reference and\n\n255\n00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:09.380\nit's not working,\n\n256\n00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:12.130\nyou may take a look at actually setting\nthat absolute reference as well.\n\n257\n00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:14.520\n>> Absolutely and I'll show you that,\nthat's a great example Ronnie.\n\n258\n00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.940\nI'll show you how to do that here,\nin just a second.\n\n259\n00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:20.490\nBut there is one more foundational\nskill that we need to\n\n260\n00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:24.530\nreference before we move on to actually\nstarting writing some of these formulas.\n\n261\n00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:27.380\nAnd that is my order of operations.\n\n262\n00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:31.736\nNow, Ronnie, before I gave everybody\na quick preview there, if I said to you,\n\n263\n00:15:31.736 --> 00:15:35.520\nplease excuse my dear Aunt Sally,\nwould you know what I mean?\n\n264\n00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:40.040\n>> I would probably know what you meant if\nI could remember what that actually meant,\n\n265\n00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:40.580\nbut no I don't.\n\n266\n00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:41.270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n267\n00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:42.790\n>> I used to love to do this when I was\n\n268\n00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:44.760\nteaching actual classrooms.\n\n269\n00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:47.300\nI would ask everybody,\nhave you ever heard the phrase,\n\n270\n00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.680\nplease excuse my dear Aunt Sally?\n\n271\n00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:54.660\nAnd it was almost over 80% of the people\nin my classroom would say yes,\n\n272\n00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.000\nI know exactly what you're talking about.\n\n273\n00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.515\nBecause it was a very common way\nto teach the order of operations.\n\n274\n00:16:00.515 --> 00:16:05.388\nAnd what we're referring to is the order\nthat the mathematical operations\n\n275\n00:16:05.388 --> 00:16:10.179\nAre gonna be carried out in, and that,\nPlease Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally,\n\n276\n00:16:10.179 --> 00:16:12.136\nalso abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\n277\n00:16:12.136 --> 00:16:16.305\nYou might have heard of the term PEMDAS\nbefore, is a way to remember the order\n\n278\n00:16:16.305 --> 00:16:20.960\nthat these mathematical calculations\nare gonna be carried out in, all right.\n\n279\n00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.110\nAnd this is the order Parenthesis,\nExponents.\n\n280\n00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:28.070\nMultiplication and\nDivision are really on the same level, but\n\n281\n00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:29.880\nusually we'll write them\nseparate like that.\n\n282\n00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:34.050\nAnd then Addition and Subtraction are also\nconsidered the same order or level, but\n\n283\n00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:35.240\nwe usually write them out like that.\n\n284\n00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.190\nSo, Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally.\n\n285\n00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:40.380\nPEMDAS, Parenthesis, Exponents,\n\n286\n00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.100\nMultiplication, Division,\nAddition, Subtraction.\n\n287\n00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:44.530\nNow, why does it make a difference?\n\n288\n00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:45.660\nWhy do we care?\n\n289\n00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:50.035\nWell, because let's take a look right\nover here at these two formulas.\n\n290\n00:16:50.035 --> 00:16:51.821\nWhich one is correct Ronnie?\n\n291\n00:16:51.821 --> 00:16:57.858\nI got 4 + 3 x 2 = 14 and 4 + 3 x 2 = 10.\n\n292\n00:16:57.858 --> 00:16:59.053\n>> I'm gonna say the first one.\n\n293\n00:16:59.053 --> 00:17:03.727\n>> The first one, so 4 + 3 x 2 = 14.\n\n294\n00:17:03.727 --> 00:17:05.820\n>> Yeah, moving from left to right,\nthat works.\n\n295\n00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:07.547\n>> All right well let's\nsee what Excel says.\n\n296\n00:17:07.547 --> 00:17:12.727\nI'm going to say = 4 + 3\n\n297\n00:17:12.727 --> 00:17:17.442\n* 2, and we get 10.\n\n298\n00:17:17.442 --> 00:17:17.986\nRight?\n\n299\n00:17:17.986 --> 00:17:18.808\nWell, why the heck?\n\n300\n00:17:18.808 --> 00:17:20.050\nCuz Ronnie makes perfect sense, right?\n\n301\n00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:22.464\n4 + 3 is 7 times 2 is 14.\n\n302\n00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:25.520\nHow is that not right?\n\n303\n00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.660\nWell, because of the way\nExcel does its math.\n\n304\n00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.930\nExcel follows the order of operations.\n\n305\n00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:35.820\nAnd if you look back here,\nparenthesis comes first.\n\n306\n00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:38.110\nI don't have parenthesis in my formula.\n\n307\n00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:39.610\nExponents comes next.\n\n308\n00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:41.190\nI don't have any of those.\n\n309\n00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:43.290\nMultiplication comes next.\n\n310\n00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:46.480\nSo we're gonna do the multiplication\nbefore the addition.\n\n311\n00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:50.729\nSo we're actually going to\nmultiply 3 * 2 for a total of 6,\n\n312\n00:17:50.729 --> 00:17:53.039\nthen I don't have any division.\n\n313\n00:17:53.039 --> 00:17:58.540\nI do have addition, 4 + 6 = 10,\nno subtraction, and we are done.\n\n314\n00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:02.830\nSo you have got to understand that because\nyou can get yourself in a world of\n\n315\n00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:06.128\ntrouble if you do not do this right,\nand I'll show you a couple of examples.\n\n316\n00:18:06.128 --> 00:18:09.810\nBut before I do that, why run this\nsimple formula, how can I fix this?\n\n317\n00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:14.620\nHow can I make Excel come up with\nthe number 14 if that's what I wanted.\n\n318\n00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:17.540\nWell you simply change\nyour formula a little bit,\n\n319\n00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:19.310\nbecause of the order of operations.\n\n320\n00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:24.747\nInstead of doing this one, = 4 + 3 x 2,\nall I'm gonna do is come in here and\n\n321\n00:18:24.747 --> 00:18:28.530\nput parentheses around the (4 + 3),\nall right.\n\n322\n00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.550\nSo now I put parentheses around (4 + 3).\n\n323\n00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:34.698\nWhich comes first in\nmy order of operation?\n\n324\n00:18:34.698 --> 00:18:37.773\nParentheses, 4 + 3 is 7.\n\n325\n00:18:37.773 --> 00:18:39.510\nThen we're gonna do exponents,\nwhich there aren't any.\n\n326\n00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:41.970\nAnd then we're gonna multiple,\n7 times 2 is 14.\n\n327\n00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:45.910\nNo division, no addition,\nno subtraction and we're done, right?\n\n328\n00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:47.770\nSo let's see if Excel\nagrees with Ronnie now.\n\n329\n00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:50.780\nAnd now we get 14.\n\n330\n00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:52.998\n>> See, I knew I was right [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So\n\n331\n00:18:52.998 --> 00:18:56.515\nwe just had a beat on Excel a little bit\nand we can make it agree with Ronnie.\n\n332\n00:18:56.515 --> 00:18:57.550\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n333\n00:18:57.550 --> 00:19:02.330\nbut it becomes extremely important to\nunderstand those order of operations.\n\n334\n00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:06.740\nAnd you can use your parenthesis to\nchange that default behavior, right?\n\n335\n00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:07.640\nThat's all you have to do.\n\n336\n00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:11.620\n>> And I think Mike, I think that makes\na great point that we have to emphasize.\n\n337\n00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:15.000\nIt's according to the way\nto Excel knows math, right?\n\n338\n00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.870\nThe very fact is, Excel knows how to do\nit according to order of operations, but\n\n339\n00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:22.050\nif you were doing the mathematical\nproblem in your head, and\n\n340\n00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:26.010\nyou said this is the number that I\nexpect to see, that I want to see.\n\n341\n00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:28.552\nIt means you need to know\nhow to manipulate that so\n\n342\n00:19:28.552 --> 00:19:31.969\nthat Excel will actually know how\nto get the result that you want.\n\n343\n00:19:31.969 --> 00:19:34.497\nAnd not necessarily the result\nthat Excel actually goes well,\n\n344\n00:19:34.497 --> 00:19:36.270\nyou didn't tell me any\nother way to do math.\n\n345\n00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:38.280\nSo, I'm gonna do it\nthe way that I know how.\n\n346\n00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:41.580\nSo, it doesn't actually mean that the\nvalues are necessarily wrong, but if you\n\n347\n00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:45.850\nget the wrong answer and you're going no,\nI'm expecting to see 14, and you see 10.\n\n348\n00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:47.120\nWell, then you go okay,\n\n349\n00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:51.000\nlet me check that order of operations\ncuz that can throw you off.\n\n350\n00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.670\nAnd that really has nothing\nto do with Excel right,\n\n351\n00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:54.250\nit has something to do with just math.\n\n352\n00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:58.738\n>> With just math exactly, because if you\nlook at these two formulas that I had up\n\n353\n00:19:58.738 --> 00:20:03.937\nhere,14 and 10 are both acceptable answers\ndepending on which way you did the math.\n\n354\n00:20:03.937 --> 00:20:07.605\nHow can we share data with other people,\nand I'm not talking about just Excel,\n\n355\n00:20:07.605 --> 00:20:08.754\nlike pen and paper days,\n\n356\n00:20:08.754 --> 00:20:12.682\nI mean the order of operations has been\naround long before computers, right?\n\n357\n00:20:12.682 --> 00:20:16.359\nWe had to come up with a standardized way\nof doing things so when two people got\n\n358\n00:20:16.359 --> 00:20:19.701\nthis formula, they would both come\nup with the same answer, right?\n\n359\n00:20:19.701 --> 00:20:21.315\nWe need consistency.\n\n360\n00:20:21.315 --> 00:20:23.542\nSo that's why the order\nof operations came about.\n\n361\n00:20:23.542 --> 00:20:26.063\nThey said, look,\nif everybody does it this way,\n\n362\n00:20:26.063 --> 00:20:28.718\nwe'll always come up with the same answer,\nright?\n\n363\n00:20:28.718 --> 00:20:32.213\nAnd we won't be arguing about,\nno it's 14, no it's 10.\n\n364\n00:20:32.213 --> 00:20:37.390\nAll right, so let's try to combine\na few of these things together.\n\n365\n00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:41.450\nGonna jump over here to this sheet and\nwhat I wanna do is I'm gonna write\n\n366\n00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:47.070\na couple of simple formulas here,\nif I can do this relatively quick.\n\n367\n00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:48.480\nI'm gonna say equals.\n\n368\n00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.510\nLet's say we wanna do.\n\n369\n00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.279\nFor this one we'll keep it.\n\n370\n00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:54.865\nWhat's a good way to do this, Ronnie?\n\n371\n00:20:54.865 --> 00:20:59.170\nI say if we wanna show that\norder of operations error or\n\n372\n00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:01.800\nthe problem we can have with that,\nlet's do this.\n\n373\n00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:07.599\nI want to pay my salespeople\na 5% commission on their sales.\n\n374\n00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:10.790\nAll right, and so\nhere's their sales for the year.\n\n375\n00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:14.850\nSo I need to add those up, right, and\nthen figure out what 5% of that is.\n\n376\n00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:18.650\nNone of that is, and that's what I\nwanna give them for their bonus.\n\n377\n00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:19.880\nSo I could write a simple formula.\n\n378\n00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:26.810\nI could say b3 equals, and\nI'll zoom in while I write this here,\n\n379\n00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:30.716\nso =b3+b4, I'm sorry not b4,\n\n380\n00:21:30.716 --> 00:21:37.652\nthat's gonna be c3+d3+ any,\nyou guys get the idea, right?\n\n381\n00:21:37.652 --> 00:21:43.747\nd3+e3+f3+ did I forget g?\n\n382\n00:21:43.747 --> 00:21:46.952\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] I gotta test my alphabet skills\n\n383\n00:21:46.952 --> 00:21:52.443\nhere, h3+, and now that I can\nsee it I'm just gonna click +,\n\n384\n00:21:52.443 --> 00:21:58.170\nclick +, click +, click +,\nyeah, I won't say that anymore.\n\n385\n00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:00.950\nLet me zoom back out just a wee bit,\nscroll over here.\n\n386\n00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:05.838\nAnd I'll take out that last + and\nI'm gonna say, * 5%, or\n\n387\n00:22:05.838 --> 00:22:08.470\n0.05, and I'll hit Enter.\n\n388\n00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:14.760\nHm, something is looking\na little bit odd here, Ronnie.\n\n389\n00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:18.244\nDo you think we should really\nbe paying them $27,000?\n\n390\n00:22:18.244 --> 00:22:21.680\nI don't even know if\ntheir total is $27,000.\n\n391\n00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:25.479\nThis is a,\nall their sales comes up to 27,966, and\n\n392\n00:22:25.479 --> 00:22:28.657\nwe're gonna pay them a bonus of 27,444.\n\n393\n00:22:28.657 --> 00:22:29.632\n>> I'd love to work there.\n\n394\n00:22:29.632 --> 00:22:33.840\n>> [LAUGH] That'd be a really\ngood company to work for, right?\n\n395\n00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.730\nAnd if you were writing this spreadsheet\nto figure out how much to pay your\n\n396\n00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:40.990\nemployees for their bonus, you're probably\nlooking for a job at this point right?\n\n397\n00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:43.440\nWell what went wrong,\nwhat went wrong with my formula?\n\n398\n00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:48.712\nI simply added up all of their sales and\nmultiplied it by 5%.\n\n399\n00:22:48.712 --> 00:22:50.105\nHow can I goof that up?\n\n400\n00:22:50.105 --> 00:22:53.240\n>> Apparently the order of operations\nis how you goofed that one up.\n\n401\n00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:57.708\n>> It is, right, because multiplication\ncomes first in the order of operations.\n\n402\n00:22:57.708 --> 00:22:59.880\nExcel said, you know what,\nlet me do that first.\n\n403\n00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:04.000\nLet me take m3, December,\nmultiply it by 5%.\n\n404\n00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.420\nNow that the multiplication is\ndone I'll add everything up, so\n\n405\n00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:10.700\nthey're getting the full month's,\njust taking that whole value.\n\n406\n00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:14.680\nHow do I fix that,\ntell Excel to do the addition first.\n\n407\n00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:17.700\nPut some parentheses\naround all the addition.\n\n408\n00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:27.852\nAnd now their bonus is\n$1,300 rather than $27,000.\n\n409\n00:23:27.852 --> 00:23:31.811\nWe could've got ourselves in a whole\nlot of trouble with that, all right?\n\n410\n00:23:31.811 --> 00:23:36.160\nNow, can I do my series field to\nfigure out what everybody's bonus is?\n\n411\n00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.970\nIf we drag that down,\nlet's see how that's gonna work.\n\n412\n00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:41.850\nLooking good, looking good, right?\n\n413\n00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:44.840\nNow, let's change it up a little bit,\nall right?\n\n414\n00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.992\nI'm gonna clear those guys out.\n\n415\n00:23:46.992 --> 00:23:51.690\nAnd what we're gonna do,\nis we're gonna change our formula.\n\n416\n00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:54.090\nBecause my bonus might change now and\nagain.\n\n417\n00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:59.410\nAnd if I manually enter this number here\nand I've got thousands of employees.\n\n418\n00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:02.608\nIf we ever change our bonus amount\nI'm going to have to go back and\n\n419\n00:24:02.608 --> 00:24:06.532\nfix every one of those formulas, or at\nleast one and then do a series fill down.\n\n420\n00:24:06.532 --> 00:24:09.030\nSo what I'm going to do is I'm going\nto change this to a cell reference.\n\n421\n00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:11.676\nI'm going to say here Is my bonus rate.\n\n422\n00:24:11.676 --> 00:24:13.022\nR3 right?\n\n423\n00:24:13.022 --> 00:24:17.180\nAnd I'm gonna hit Enter and\nI get the exact same number right?\n\n424\n00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:20.810\nCuz it's doing the same thing, .05 or 5%.\n\n425\n00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:25.900\nNow I start doing a series fill on\nthis and nobody else gets a bonus.\n\n426\n00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.360\nWhat happened?\n\n427\n00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:31.200\nWell remember,\nwhen I moved that formula down one,\n\n428\n00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.800\nall the numbers that\nare adding up move down one.\n\n429\n00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.870\nWell that's good,\nnow I'm on Lopez, my second row.\n\n430\n00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:41.240\nBut where it was getting the bonus\nrate from also moved down one.\n\n431\n00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.900\nThis was multiplying by R3.\n\n432\n00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:46.280\nThis one's multiplying by R4.\n\n433\n00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.420\nAnd R4 is blank.\n\n434\n00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.524\nThis one's multiplying by R5.\n\n435\n00:24:50.524 --> 00:24:56.300\nSo somehow, I need this part of\nthe formula to move down with each row.\n\n436\n00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:00.760\nBut I need the bonus rate reference,\nthat R3, to stay there.\n\n437\n00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:01.980\nAll right.\n\n438\n00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:04.420\nThat's where that absolute\nreference comes into play.\n\n439\n00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:05.310\nLet's see if we can fix it.\n\n440\n00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:06.548\nWe go back over here.\n\n441\n00:25:06.548 --> 00:25:09.242\nAnd we change this to say hey,\nyou know what?\n\n442\n00:25:09.242 --> 00:25:12.251\nDo not change the column value.\n\n443\n00:25:12.251 --> 00:25:14.886\nDo not change the row value.\n\n444\n00:25:14.886 --> 00:25:19.700\nLeave that R3 the same no matter\nwhere I move that formula.\n\n445\n00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:20.900\nI'll hit Enter.\n\n446\n00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:22.970\nThis one still works just fine.\n\n447\n00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:26.140\nNow when I do my series fill,\nthey work fine as well.\n\n448\n00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:30.968\nNotice that each one of\nthese is multiplying by R3,\n\n449\n00:25:30.968 --> 00:25:36.798\neverything else is changing,\nbut the R3 is staying the same.\n\n450\n00:25:36.798 --> 00:25:39.367\nSo you can see where those\nrelative references and\n\n451\n00:25:39.367 --> 00:25:42.300\nthose absolute references\ncan make a difference.\n\n452\n00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:45.590\nWe can also see where those order of\n\n453\n00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:48.150\noperations can make a big\ndifference in the outcome.\n\n454\n00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:49.241\nRight?\nSo these are things we have\n\n455\n00:25:49.241 --> 00:25:49.812\nto think about.\n\n456\n00:25:49.812 --> 00:25:53.049\nAnd we didn't really look at\nwriting a lot of formulas.\n\n457\n00:25:53.049 --> 00:25:57.076\nBut we got to see the basics that we\nneed to understand in order to make\n\n458\n00:25:57.076 --> 00:25:58.820\nsuccessful formulas.\n\n459\n00:25:58.820 --> 00:25:59.320\nAll right.\n\n460\n00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:03.240\nWe can also do ranges.\n\n461\n00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:05.789\nNow I'm gonna,\nto wipe these formulas out here.\n\n462\n00:26:08.548 --> 00:26:12.220\nAnd we're gonna try to\nreference a range this time.\n\n463\n00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:15.770\nNow unfortunately Microsoft does\nthrow this ahead of our formulas.\n\n464\n00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:20.080\nI'm gonna use a formula cuz that's really\nwhere ranges are gonna come into play.\n\n465\n00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.040\nAnother way to do that.\n\n466\n00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:24.170\nI said we could take each cell and\nput a plus sign in between them.\n\n467\n00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:25.440\nRight?\nTo add them all up.\n\n468\n00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:31.174\nAnother way we could do that is\nto use a function I should say,\n\n469\n00:26:31.174 --> 00:26:33.656\nnot a formula, =sum(.\n\n470\n00:26:33.656 --> 00:26:38.395\nNow, sum is a built-in function and\nit says, all right,\n\n471\n00:26:38.395 --> 00:26:42.860\nsum(, and\nthen what numbers do you wanna add up?\n\n472\n00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:46.300\nAnd I can just do,\nwhat was that first cell there, B3?\n\n473\n00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:52.530\nI can type in B3 and\nthen instead of a plus sign, a comma.\n\n474\n00:26:53.545 --> 00:26:58.290\nc3, and then all the way out d3,\nall the way out to the end.\n\n475\n00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:03.150\nAnd then close your parentheses,\nand hit Enter, right.\n\n476\n00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:05.230\nAnd that's gonna start\nadding those values up.\n\n477\n00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:06.221\nDid I not get the right ones.\n\n478\n00:27:06.221 --> 00:27:08.340\nYeah, that's gonna add those guys up.\n\n479\n00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:12.694\nSo if we look at this one it's\nstill doing the same thing,\n\n480\n00:27:12.694 --> 00:27:15.418\nit's adding those three values but\n\n481\n00:27:15.418 --> 00:27:20.246\ninstead of saying b3 + c3 + d3,\nI just said sum b3 c3 d3.\n\n482\n00:27:20.246 --> 00:27:21.100\nRight?\n\n483\n00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:22.910\nNow with 12 of them.\n\n484\n00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:24.800\nThat's a lot of typing, right?\n\n485\n00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:28.960\nSo there's another way I could do this,\nand let me zoom back in here.\n\n486\n00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:32.600\nAnd that's where my range\nreferences come into play.\n\n487\n00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:38.534\nInstead of trying to list\neach cell individually,\n\n488\n00:27:38.534 --> 00:27:44.608\nwhat I could do is I could\nsay let's add up b3:m3.\n\n489\n00:27:44.608 --> 00:27:48.442\nAnd as I zoom back out look at\nthe box that it drew, right?\n\n490\n00:27:48.442 --> 00:27:53.192\nI'm saying, go all the way from b3 to m3.\n\n491\n00:27:53.192 --> 00:27:54.550\nYeah, see how it's doing that?\n\n492\n00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:58.441\nAnd we'll end up with that same value.\n\n493\n00:27:58.441 --> 00:28:00.240\nAll right, so just another way to do it.\n\n494\n00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:03.620\nYou can reference those ranges and\nthis won't make sense, but\n\n495\n00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:07.790\njust watch the selection box because it\nwill teach you how these ranges work.\n\n496\n00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:10.200\nIf I change this to b3:m4, all right.\n\n497\n00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:16.350\nb3 is basically your starting point.\n\n498\n00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:17.860\nm4, your ending point.\n\n499\n00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:20.280\nAnd it's gonna grab\neverything in between there.\n\n500\n00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:25.547\nIf I change this to m14, right?\n\n501\n00:28:25.547 --> 00:28:30.060\nYou see how it now goes from b3\nall the way down to m14, okay?\n\n502\n00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:34.600\nWith these ranges you can\nalso drag these boxes around,\n\n503\n00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.250\nwhich is kind of a cool little trick.\n\n504\n00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:37.540\nNot really a part of the objectives, but\n\n505\n00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:41.670\njust understand you can move\nthe selection boxes around.\n\n506\n00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:43.040\nThat might be a little beyond this,\nbut hey,\n\n507\n00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:45.400\nsomething to play with after\nwe're done with this episode.\n\n508\n00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:50.040\nAll right, Ronnie,\nwhat else do we have to talk about?\n\n509\n00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.130\n>> Named ranges.\n\n510\n00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:53.700\n>> Named ranges are another\nreally cool one.\n\n511\n00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:57.030\nI love my name ranges.\n\n512\n00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:00.000\nThey come in handy all the time.\n\n513\n00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.510\nLet's do a couple of things here.\n\n514\n00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:06.271\nLet's do this.\n\n515\n00:29:06.271 --> 00:29:10.429\nI'm gonna select all of these cells,\nright?\n\n516\n00:29:10.429 --> 00:29:15.577\nAnd then I'm gonna go up to the main\nbox up here in the corner and\n\n517\n00:29:15.577 --> 00:29:20.144\nI'm gonna type in Rodgers,\nand I'm gonna hit Enter.\n\n518\n00:29:20.144 --> 00:29:20.870\nAll right.\n\n519\n00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:25.800\nNow that is,\nthis range of cells has a specific name.\n\n520\n00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:29.470\nIf I go to my drop down list,\nI can choose Rodgers, and\n\n521\n00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:31.160\nlook what cells it highlights, right?\n\n522\n00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:36.731\nI can do the same thing,\nwe'll do Laura down here,\n\n523\n00:29:36.731 --> 00:29:42.561\njust to make it little more obvious,\nI'll say Lara,\n\n524\n00:29:42.561 --> 00:29:48.671\nall right, and now I can go to Lara,\nI can go to Rodgers.\n\n525\n00:29:48.671 --> 00:29:52.490\nAnd you might think whoop di do Mike,\nwhat's the big deal there?\n\n526\n00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:55.830\nWell now I can start\nusing that in formulas.\n\n527\n00:29:55.830 --> 00:30:03.420\nI can say equals, sum, open parenthesis,\nRogers, close parenthesis, enter.\n\n528\n00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:06.030\nAnd look at that, right.\n\n529\n00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:08.170\nSo now I'm referencing that same thing,\nand\n\n530\n00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:11.640\ninstead of saying b3:m3,\nI can just say Rogers.\n\n531\n00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:16.890\nAnd that can be extremely handy especially\nwhen you're writing formulas on different\n\n532\n00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:21.490\nworksheets and you have to reference those\nranges that are on separate worksheets,\n\n533\n00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:25.150\nusing those name ranges\ncan be extremely handy.\n\n534\n00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:29.040\nSome other examples, I know we're\ngetting low on time here Ronnie.\n\n535\n00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:35.683\nBut let me try this,\nlet me say I'm gonna call this January.\n\n536\n00:30:35.683 --> 00:30:36.867\nAll right?\n\n537\n00:30:38.833 --> 00:30:43.234\nAnd I'm gonna call this one,\nyou'll never guess.\n\n538\n00:30:43.234 --> 00:30:45.242\nFebruary.\n\n539\n00:30:48.097 --> 00:30:49.756\nAll right?\n\n540\n00:30:49.756 --> 00:30:51.854\nI'm gonna try to tie\nsome of these together.\n\n541\n00:30:51.854 --> 00:30:56.837\nAnd then what I'm gonna do is,\nI'm gonna put it for here,\n\n542\n00:30:56.837 --> 00:31:00.112\nI'm gonna say equals sum of January.\n\n543\n00:31:00.112 --> 00:31:05.740\nHere I'm gonna say it\nequals sum of February.\n\n544\n00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:08.890\nSo same thing I was doing over there,\n\n545\n00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:12.200\nit's just adding up all the values\nthat are in that named range.\n\n546\n00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:17.350\nThen over here I'm gonna say\nI wanna see a total for,\n\n547\n00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:19.490\nand we should do March and\nthen we can call it quarter one.\n\n548\n00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:24.590\nSo let's say I add March,\nwe'll call this one\n\n549\n00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:29.600\nMAR, so now I've got that one here.\n\n550\n00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:35.370\nWe're gonna do equals sum of March, and\n\n551\n00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:40.343\nthen over here I wanna\nput quarter one totals,\n\n552\n00:31:40.343 --> 00:31:43.370\nall right.\n\n553\n00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:46.020\nNow I could try to go over there and\ngrab quarter one's data.\n\n554\n00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:47.990\nAnd this is a relatively\nsmall spreadsheet, so\n\n555\n00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:50.050\nit wouldn't be that difficult.\n\n556\n00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:55.149\nOr without even looking at what rows and\n\n557\n00:31:55.149 --> 00:32:00.400\nwhat columns I need, I can say equals sum\n\n558\n00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:05.210\nof January, February, and March.\n\n559\n00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:07.770\nClose my parenthesis, and enter.\n\n560\n00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:10.211\nIt's that easy because\nI named those ranges,\n\n561\n00:32:10.211 --> 00:32:13.040\nI don't even have to look to\ngo see where January end.\n\n562\n00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:15.357\nOkay, it's B32.\n\n563\n00:32:15.357 --> 00:32:17.410\nWhere's that total at, right?\n\n564\n00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:21.510\nIt just took these three name ranges,\nand added them together.\n\n565\n00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:25.380\nSo if we take a look at that formula\nagain, I'm adding up the named ranges.\n\n566\n00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:28.910\nSo the point of this is,\nyou can name cells.\n\n567\n00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:32.850\nAnd even more important,\nyou can name ranges of cells.\n\n568\n00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:37.520\nAnd then I can use that to either jump\nto that location in the spreadsheet or\n\n569\n00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:38.550\nin formulas.\n\n570\n00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:41.530\nI can use those name references and\n\n571\n00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:43.930\nnot have to worry about\nthe specific cell references.\n\n572\n00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:46.493\nSo, named ranges, I use them all the time.\n\n573\n00:32:46.493 --> 00:32:47.924\nWell Mike, thank you for\n\n574\n00:32:47.924 --> 00:32:52.820\nactually showing us the ability to begin\nto work with formulas a little bit.\n\n575\n00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:56.850\nUnderstanding the order of operations is\nprobably one of the key elements here.\n\n576\n00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:59.360\nThat Excel only knows how\nto do math one way and\n\n577\n00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:02.070\nwe have to actually understand that\nif we're gonna actually create\n\n578\n00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:05.390\nthe formulas that we need to show\nus the results that we need.\n\n579\n00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:09.820\nAlso we've got to see here again is\nactually the use of the relative reference\n\n580\n00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:12.050\nand why it's actually very important for\nus.\n\n581\n00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:15.140\nAnd we haven't even really began\nto hit some of the more complex\n\n582\n00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:16.430\nformulas that are out there.\n\n583\n00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:19.110\nBut understanding and seeing\nthe foundations of this is really gonna\n\n584\n00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:22.310\nhelp us as we move on and\nactually learn a little bit more.\n\n585\n00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:24.640\nMike, any final words about the formulas?\n\n586\n00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:28.500\n>> Stay turned for some more excitement\nbecause it does get even better but yeah,\n\n587\n00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:31.190\nthis foundational knowledge\nwill help you be successful.\n\n588\n00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:34.159\nIf you don't understand\nthe order of operations,\n\n589\n00:33:34.159 --> 00:33:38.588\nif you don't understand how to reference\ncells, ranges of cells, named.\n\n590\n00:33:38.588 --> 00:33:41.581\nAnd if you don't understand\nthose relative and absolutes,\n\n591\n00:33:41.581 --> 00:33:43.879\nformulas will give you\nall kinds of problems.\n\n592\n00:33:43.879 --> 00:33:45.589\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Once you get those down Pat,\n\n593\n00:33:45.589 --> 00:33:47.612\nformulas really aren't that bad.\n\n594\n00:33:47.612 --> 00:33:48.517\n>> Excellent.\n\n595\n00:33:48.517 --> 00:33:51.690\nWell, that's a great place for\nus to go and end this episode then.\n\n596\n00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:55.280\nSigning off for IT pro TV,\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n597\n00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:56.120\n>> And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n598\n00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:57.997\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n599\n00:33:57.997 --> 00:34:05.889\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:21.180\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today we're\ntaking a look at Microsoft Excel 2016.\n\n4\n00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.190\nAnd we're specifically going to be\nentering into the arena of functions.\n\n5\n00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.470\nWe've taken a look at\nbasic formula foundations.\n\n6\n00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.620\nNow we're gonna take a look at some\nof the most common functions and\n\n7\n00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.230\neven some conditional logic statements so\n\n8\n00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.430\nthat we can get ready for more advanced\nformulas and functions that are coming up.\n\n9\n00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.180\nAnd who better to help us then, well, the\nfunction master himself, Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.760\nHow's it going Mike?\n\n11\n00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.940\n>> It's going fantastic.\n\n12\n00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.520\nWe're getting into the really\nexciting stuff with the formulas and\n\n13\n00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.730\nthe functions now.\n\n14\n00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:49.490\nSo I'm glad to be here.\n\n15\n00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:54.650\nGlad to be able to show you guys some of\nthe ways you can use these functions and\n\n16\n00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.620\nformulas to work with your spreadsheets.\n\n17\n00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.420\nAs Ronnie said, we're gonna\nstart off with some basic ones.\n\n18\n00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.380\nWe'll start with just a simple sum and\nyou've seen me do this in a couple of\n\n19\n00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.460\nother episodes, I kept saying we'll\ntalk more about it in a later episode.\n\n20\n00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.450\nWell here we are.\n\n21\n00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.930\nWe are in that later episode.\n\n22\n00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.320\nWe're now going to talk about it.\n\n23\n00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.740\nSo let's take a look at what\nI've got here on my computer.\n\n24\n00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.680\nI've got that same spreadsheet up where\nit's got a list of salespeople down\n\n25\n00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.090\nthe left-hand side.\n\n26\n00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.960\nI've got the months across the top right\nthere and then some values plugged in for\n\n27\n00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.110\ntheir sales.\n\n28\n00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.030\nAnd a very common thing to do is to need\nto be able to get some totals out of this.\n\n29\n00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.650\nAll right, get some sums.\n\n30\n00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.670\nSo let's start by, let's do a month.\n\n31\n00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.990\nWe'll do it this way first.\n\n32\n00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.790\nWe'll do it vertically.\n\n33\n00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.190\nSo what I wanna do,\nis I want a total for January sales.\n\n34\n00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.930\nSo I could go down to the bottom.\n\n35\n00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.010\nMaybe we add a row, call it Totals,\nsomething like that.\n\n36\n00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.940\nAnd then here's where I'm\ngonna put my formula.\n\n37\n00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.560\nNow the formula that I wanna use,\nwe saw in a previous episode I could say,\n\n38\n00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.090\nlet's see where this starts.\n\n39\n00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.148\nIt starts at b3 is the first value,\n\n40\n00:02:03.148 --> 00:02:08.881\nso I could try to say =b3+b4+b5 and\n\n41\n00:02:08.881 --> 00:02:16.818\nall the way down to where do we end here,\nb32, right.\n\n42\n00:02:16.818 --> 00:02:20.200\nIt'll be a lot of typing to\ntry to get all of that in.\n\n43\n00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.000\nSo rather than do that,\nwe're gonna use a function, all right?\n\n44\n00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.670\nA function's that built-in formula where\nyou just got to tell it what function you\n\n45\n00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.720\nwant to use, and you'll see as I type, and\n\n46\n00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.290\nlet me click away and do that again so\nyou can see that full list there.\n\n47\n00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.580\nAs I type, Excel gives me a list\n\n48\n00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.860\nof all of the built-in functions that\nit has that in this case start with s.\n\n49\n00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.530\nAnd you can see there's a ton.\n\n50\n00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.040\nThere are a lot of built-in formulas.\n\n51\n00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.700\nAnd as I type,\nI get down to what I need, I get sum.\n\n52\n00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.110\nIt says,\nadds all the numbers in a range of cells.\n\n53\n00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.980\nWell, that's what I'm trying to do.\n\n54\n00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.760\nSo I'm gonna type in sum(.\n\n55\n00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.030\nOne of the beautiful things about Excel\nis it really helps you with this.\n\n56\n00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.620\nIt tells you exactly what to do.\n\n57\n00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.870\nYou see how the number1 is bold?\n\n58\n00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.995\nIt's saying hey, what's the first\nnumber you want to add up?\n\n59\n00:03:10.995 --> 00:03:14.980\nAnd then there's a comma and\nthen there's a second number.\n\n60\n00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.130\nSo again I could list them, b2,\nand you see it goes to number2.\n\n61\n00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.770\nIt's saying hey, now put in number2.\n\n62\n00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.950\nb3, and then what's the third\nnumber you want to add together?\n\n63\n00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.260\nAgain, I could list them\nall the way out to b32.\n\n64\n00:03:30.292 --> 00:03:32.920\nI'm gonna kind of cheat and\n\n65\n00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.229\ndo this a little bit differently because\nI don't like to type all of that.\n\n66\n00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.380\nSo what I'm going to do, I got =sum(.\n\n67\n00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.720\nI'm still typing my formula,\nbut I'm just going to click and\n\n68\n00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.886\ndrag to select.\n\n69\n00:03:51.886 --> 00:03:56.848\nAnd now if we zoom back in,\nyou'll see what it does.\n\n70\n00:03:56.848 --> 00:04:00.950\nIt does that range notation that we\ntalked about in a previous episode.\n\n71\n00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:07.308\nRather then list every single one of them,\njust say hey, start at b3 end at b32.\n\n72\n00:04:07.308 --> 00:04:08.940\nAnd I could have typed that just the same.\n\n73\n00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.590\nRather then clicking and dragging I\ncould type in b3: instead of a comma,\n\n74\n00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.460\nfor a range you're gonna use a colon, b32.\n\n75\n00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:21.840\nAnd you'll see Excel actually\ndraws that same box for me.\n\n76\n00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:29.460\nWhen I'm done with my function, I simply\nclose my parentheses and I hit Enter.\n\n77\n00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.081\nAnd there is my total, right?\n\n78\n00:04:33.081 --> 00:04:35.061\n87,404.\n\n79\n00:04:35.061 --> 00:04:39.741\nAgain you can see\nthe formula in the formula\n\n80\n00:04:39.741 --> 00:04:44.161\nbar =SUM(B3:B32), all right?\n\n81\n00:04:44.161 --> 00:04:48.390\nNow, if I want to do the rest of these,\nI could type that formula out again.\n\n82\n00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.988\nI could say =SUM(C3:C32), right?\n\n83\n00:04:52.988 --> 00:04:55.108\nBut you know we're not gonna do that.\n\n84\n00:04:55.108 --> 00:04:58.748\nWhat are we gonna do, Ronnie?\n\n85\n00:04:58.748 --> 00:05:00.900\n>> Auto-fill?\n>> Yeah, auto-fill, exactly.\n\n86\n00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.380\nWe're just gonna drag that formula across\nbecause those values are relative, right?\n\n87\n00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.520\nThere's no dollar signs in them so\n\n88\n00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.870\nthat means it's going to\nchange as I move the formula.\n\n89\n00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.130\nWhen I drag it over one,\nit's gonna say C3 to C32.\n\n90\n00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.170\nDrag it over one more, D3 to D32, right?\n\n91\n00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.170\nSo if we click on that,\nsure enough, D3 to D32.\n\n92\n00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.300\nSo now there's all my totals, and\n\n93\n00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.070\nmaybe we wanna make that look a little bit\ndifferent, stand out from everything else.\n\n94\n00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.210\nI might make that bold there.\n\n95\n00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.130\nAnd maybe I wanna put a line above it\n\n96\n00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.920\nto kind of separate it\nfrom the rest of the date.\n\n97\n00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.338\nAll right, so sum, pretty straightforward\nyou just have to tell it what numbers.\n\n98\n00:05:43.338 --> 00:05:46.420\nThe numbers don' t have to be touching,\njust for\n\n99\n00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.690\ngiggles I'm going come over here and\n=b3 +, no,\n\n100\n00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:56.440\nI'm not going to do that I'll do a sum(\nand just pick some random cells.\n\n101\n00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:02.370\nD5, G13, sounds like we're\nplaying battle ship or something.\n\n102\n00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:07.120\nI'll pick another cell over here in\nmy parenthesis and I'll zoom in so\n\n103\n00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.150\nyou can see that.\n\n104\n00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.670\nAnd then hit Enter.\n\n105\n00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.780\nAnd I've got my formula there,\nor my function, I should say.\n\n106\n00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.900\nSo just understand that they\ndon't have to be contiguous.\n\n107\n00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.700\n>> Now, Mike, I'm actually noticing\nsomething else right above all of your\n\n108\n00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.270\ndata that you have there.\n\n109\n00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.340\nInside of that formula bar that you\nhave right up there, it looks like it\n\n110\n00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.260\nwas actually typing it out as you\nwere using those functions, right.\n\n111\n00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.130\n>> Absolutely.\n\n112\n00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:31.650\nIn fact, we can do that again.\n\n113\n00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:38.646\nI'll say = all right I'm typing here,\nbut notice it's typing up here sum(.\n\n114\n00:06:38.646 --> 00:06:42.050\nAnd you could type it straight\nup here if you wanted to.\n\n115\n00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.150\nYou can pick the cell that you want that\nformula or the answer to be in write\n\n116\n00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:51.396\nthe results of your function, and\nI can come up here and say =sum(.\n\n117\n00:06:51.396 --> 00:06:54.220\nAnd sometimes this is handy\nbecause if you're out here,\n\n118\n00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.720\nyou could be overlapping other data,\nmaking it difficult to see.\n\n119\n00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:03.200\nI've written some formulas and functions\nthat are used, some nested functions,\n\n120\n00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.660\nwhere I've actually had\nto make this bigger, so\n\n121\n00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:11.860\nyou can have all the room you need to\ntype that formula of function in there.\n\n122\n00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.210\n>> Now Mike, since you are actually\nright there in the formula bar.\n\n123\n00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.498\nAs you started using that\nsum function up there,\n\n124\n00:07:17.498 --> 00:07:22.430\nI also noticed that little fx to\nthe left of that actually showed up.\n\n125\n00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:23.350\nWhat was that about?\n\n126\n00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.720\n>> This is where I can get access\nto all of those functions, right?\n\n127\n00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.880\nIf we open this up I can\ndo an insert function,\n\n128\n00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.020\nand if I want to do a max for example.\n\n129\n00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.070\nI can select that, click OK,\n\n130\n00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:39.980\nand you'll see it dumps in that max,\nif I move that over a little bit.\n\n131\n00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.330\nAnd then it tries to pick a range,\nand I could go pick the range.\n\n132\n00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.500\nSo if you're not sure\nwhat the function is or\n\n133\n00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.720\nwhat it's called,\ncuz I know it used to be avg for average.\n\n134\n00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.850\nIt's now spelled out average, right?\n\n135\n00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:52.550\nSo you might have to go look.\n\n136\n00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.462\nAnd you might see some functions in\nthere that you've never heard of.\n\n137\n00:07:55.462 --> 00:07:59.942\nLike, I'm not big on standard deviations\nand some of these cosines and tangents,\n\n138\n00:07:59.942 --> 00:08:01.543\nbut all of those are in there.\n\n139\n00:08:01.543 --> 00:08:04.322\nSo if you need a full list of functions,\n\n140\n00:08:04.322 --> 00:08:08.550\ngo up to that little fx and\nit'll pull those guys up for you.\n\n141\n00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:13.850\nAnd it gives you some help about it,\nit'll show you what that sum if is.\n\n142\n00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:16.330\nGive you a little description on there.\n\n143\n00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.330\nPayment right, figure out what\nyour payment is with your rate and\n\n144\n00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.560\nyour interest and all that good stuff.\n\n145\n00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:26.170\nSo, easy access to all of those,\nand they are categorized as well.\n\n146\n00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:28.000\nSo this is Most Recently Used, but\n\n147\n00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.540\nI can look at just Statistical\ntype functions, right?\n\n148\n00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.740\nAnd I can find that\nfunction I'm looking for.\n\n149\n00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.980\nAnd there are literally, I would say,\n\n150\n00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:40.290\nclose to 100 plus\nfunctions built into Excel.\n\n151\n00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:42.680\nAll right, so we got the sum.\n\n152\n00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:47.150\nAnother common one that we\nmight wanna do is min and max.\n\n153\n00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:50.080\nAnd the name pretty much tells\nyou what they're gonna do, right?\n\n154\n00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:54.510\nI'll go ahead and make a header\nup here at the top for min and\n\n155\n00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:58.680\nmax, and then we'll go ahead and\nwrite our functions here.\n\n156\n00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.820\nOr we'll create our functions.\n\n157\n00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:04.830\nSo I'm gonna say =min.\n\n158\n00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.640\nAll functions and\nformulas start with an equals sign.\n\n159\n00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:12.080\nName of that function, in this case min,\nopen parentheses, right?\n\n160\n00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.330\nAnd again, it tells me, what do you want?\n\n161\n00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.630\nWell, minimum is gonna\nfind the lowest number.\n\n162\n00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:22.600\nAnd I need to know what is the worst\nmonth for the salesperson?\n\n163\n00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.040\nSo I'm going to do the whole click and\ndrag option here.\n\n164\n00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:30.055\nI'm going to say out of all these number,\nB3 through M3,\n\n165\n00:09:30.055 --> 00:09:34.180\nall right, end my parentheses,\nand hit Enter.\n\n166\n00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.910\nAnd $560 dollars is his lowest month.\n\n167\n00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:43.030\nAnd if we zoom back out,\nyou see that looks about right.\n\n168\n00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:45.130\n5604.\n\n169\n00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.350\nYep, sure enough,\nthat is his minimum value.\n\n170\n00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:49.850\nAnd I can do my series fill.\n\n171\n00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:54.160\nJust double click on that little\nbold box at the bottom and\n\n172\n00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.030\nI've got it all the way now.\n\n173\n00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:59.790\nNow I've got a quick, easy way to see\nwhat their lowest month value was.\n\n174\n00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.430\nAnd max would be just the opposite, right?\n\n175\n00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:04.290\nWhat's their highest value?\n\n176\n00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:08.544\nSo I'll do a =max, open parenthesis.\n\n177\n00:10:08.544 --> 00:10:13.961\nIt's gonna be that same range, B3:N3.\n\n178\n00:10:13.961 --> 00:10:17.840\nAnd I love how I can\nsee what I just typed.\n\n179\n00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.880\nThat's kind of a visual validation for me.\n\n180\n00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.050\nKeep in mind, again you can drag\nthese selection boxes around.\n\n181\n00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:27.520\nAnd you'll see what's typed\nover there actually changes,\n\n182\n00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.520\nI always like playing with that.\n\n183\n00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.705\nAnd then you can do an closed parentheses,\nhit Enter, and\n\n184\n00:10:32.705 --> 00:10:34.785\nthere's his highest value, right?\n\n185\n00:10:34.785 --> 00:10:37.814\nNow we talked the other day about\ndoing conditional forwarding,\n\n186\n00:10:37.814 --> 00:10:41.340\nI'm sorry conditional forwarding,\nconditional formatting, where I can\n\n187\n00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:45.650\nhave the largest numbers highlighted,\nI can have the lowest numbers highlighted.\n\n188\n00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:48.940\nSometimes we need to have\na way to figure that out,\n\n189\n00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.380\nput that value in some other cell.\n\n190\n00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.330\nNow we've got functions\nthat can allow that.\n\n191\n00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:59.470\nI'll go ahead and drag that down as well\nand get all those maxes there, all right.\n\n192\n00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:03.350\nAnother common one that\nwe want to do is count.\n\n193\n00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:05.310\nCount probably would, let's save count.\n\n194\n00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:09.310\nI've got another spreadsheet I think that\ncount will make a little more sense on.\n\n195\n00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:12.890\nIt's a very straightforward type\nof formula, but I'll save that for\n\n196\n00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:13.920\njust a minute.\n\n197\n00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:18.056\nAnd we'll go ahead and do average next.\n\n198\n00:11:18.056 --> 00:11:20.820\nAll right, but\nit works the exact same way.\n\n199\n00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.450\nIt's not all that complicated, right?\n\n200\n00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:26.370\nOnce you learn how to write these formulas\nor use these functions, I should say.\n\n201\n00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:27.050\nThese aren't formulas.\n\n202\n00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:28.100\nThese are functions.\n\n203\n00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:31.530\nOnce you learn how to use these functions,\nthey're pretty straightforward.\n\n204\n00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:37.740\nStart with an equal, name of the function,\nin this case average, open parentheses.\n\n205\n00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.730\nAnd then Excel tells you\nwhat it's expecting.\n\n206\n00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:44.490\nWhat numbers do you want\nme to get the average for?\n\n207\n00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:50.241\nSame thing, B3:M3, right?\n\n208\n00:11:50.241 --> 00:11:57.108\nClose my parenthesis, hit Enter,\nand there's his average, right?\n\n209\n00:11:57.108 --> 00:11:59.450\nAnd then I can do a series fill on that.\n\n210\n00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:03.280\nWrite that down, and\nnow I've got their averages as well.\n\n211\n00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.680\nAnd then we could get really fancy.\n\n212\n00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.921\nI could come down here.\n\n213\n00:12:06.921 --> 00:12:07.810\nThat wouldn't make sense, though.\n\n214\n00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:10.470\nWe don't really need a total of the min or\na total of the max.\n\n215\n00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:14.140\nWe could start getting complex with these.\n\n216\n00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:18.133\nWe'll save that for a whole another\nseries when we get into Excel,\n\n217\n00:12:18.133 --> 00:12:19.786\nthe more advanced topics.\n\n218\n00:12:19.786 --> 00:12:23.576\nBut we can start combining these things,\nand we can start doing totals,\n\n219\n00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:27.610\nand then average of the totals, and\nwe can do it all in one statement.\n\n220\n00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:29.130\nIt's really pretty impressive.\n\n221\n00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:33.980\nAll right, so we've got our min,\nmax, average,\n\n222\n00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:39.410\nagain as you saw there are dozens and\ndozens of other functions that we can use.\n\n223\n00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:43.060\nLet's take a look at another\nspreadsheet that I've got for us.\n\n224\n00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:50.791\nAnd let's take a look at doing one,\nlet's do a count, all right.\n\n225\n00:12:50.791 --> 00:12:52.566\nWhere could I do this?\n\n226\n00:12:52.566 --> 00:12:55.620\nAll right, so\nthis is a spreadsheet of January sales.\n\n227\n00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:57.850\nAnd maybe I wanna know\nhow many sales I have.\n\n228\n00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:02.260\nNow, in this case I can really probably\nlook at the row number and figure it out,\n\n229\n00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:02.840\nright?\n\n230\n00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.730\nEach one of those rows\nis gonna be in order,\n\n231\n00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:07.840\nbut maybe it doesn't start\nat the top of the page.\n\n232\n00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:12.140\nMaybe we move these data,\nwe insert rows up above these data,\n\n233\n00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:13.750\nand that would end up changing.\n\n234\n00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:17.240\nThat row indicator might not\nbe the exact number of order.\n\n235\n00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:21.740\nSo if I wanna do a count,\nlet me slide this guy over here, and\n\n236\n00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:27.889\nI could really do it in\nany one of these I'll say\n\n237\n00:13:27.889 --> 00:13:33.410\n=count( and then this\n\n238\n00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:38.590\nis gonna be D, I think we start at three,\nRonnie let me just double check that here.\n\n239\n00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:46.576\nAll the way to 251, D2,\nI would have got that wrong.\n\n240\n00:13:50.404 --> 00:13:54.142\nAll right, so we'll zoom back in.\n\n241\n00:13:54.142 --> 00:14:03.110\nCount (d2:d251) end my parentheses,\nhit Enter.\n\n242\n00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:05.630\nAnd there we go, I got 250 total.\n\n243\n00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:08.230\nSo what counts is doing is\nit's ignoring the value.\n\n244\n00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:12.861\nIt doesn't care about 84 or\nthe 62 or the 93.\n\n245\n00:14:12.861 --> 00:14:14.946\nIt's saying how many entries are there?\n\n246\n00:14:14.946 --> 00:14:16.970\nAnd sometimes I need to know.\n\n247\n00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:20.220\nLike if I'm doing an average\nI need to know the count.\n\n248\n00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.630\nI might be doing an average and\nnot using that average function.\n\n249\n00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:25.950\nMaybe I just need to count how\nmany records there are, all right?\n\n250\n00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:30.870\nSo that's what that count is for,\nis the ability to just count the number of\n\n251\n00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:35.510\nvalues, not adding them up, not figuring\nout what the min or the max is.\n\n252\n00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:38.618\nSo all of those are pretty\nstraightforward.\n\n253\n00:14:38.618 --> 00:14:42.260\nEquals, name of the function,\nopen parentheses,\n\n254\n00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:46.580\nand then the cells that you\nwant to use in that function.\n\n255\n00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:49.470\nNow we can list them out individually,\nB3, B4,\n\n256\n00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:54.440\nB5 or we can use those\nranges that we talked about.\n\n257\n00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:59.587\nWe can say B3:M3 to go\nall the way from B to M.\n\n258\n00:14:59.587 --> 00:15:04.920\nWe can also use names ranges, we talked\nabout those in a previous episode.\n\n259\n00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.050\nLet's flip back over to\nthat other spreadsheet and\n\n260\n00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:09.290\nsee how that would change things.\n\n261\n00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:13.300\nWith our min we did B3 through M3.\n\n262\n00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:16.010\nWhat if I gave this range a name?\n\n263\n00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:20.930\nI would call this Rogers.\n\n264\n00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:25.245\nAll right, and now for my formula,\nnow look, it's 560 right now.\n\n265\n00:15:25.245 --> 00:15:30.020\nI'm gonnna say MIN(rogers).\n\n266\n00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:31.489\nAll right so\nyou can see what I'm typing in,\n\n267\n00:15:31.489 --> 00:15:33.250\noops see what I'm typing in over there.\n\n268\n00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:36.150\n=MIN, and then name range (rogers).\n\n269\n00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:42.390\nI hit Enter, scroll back out,\nmove over and it still works just fine.\n\n270\n00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:45.079\nRight, so those name ranges can be\n\n271\n00:15:45.079 --> 00:15:49.451\nused anywhere you would\nnormally use a cell reference.\n\n272\n00:15:49.451 --> 00:15:53.231\n>> Well, Mike, these particular types\nof basic functions, they really\n\n273\n00:15:53.231 --> 00:15:57.579\nare foundational not only because they're\nkind of the basic things we do in math,\n\n274\n00:15:57.579 --> 00:16:01.548\nbut they really help us to understand\nin using the basic functions here as we\n\n275\n00:16:01.548 --> 00:16:03.646\nalso get into more and more functions.\n\n276\n00:16:03.646 --> 00:16:06.157\nYou're gonna see a lot of\nthe other functions that we use.\n\n277\n00:16:06.157 --> 00:16:09.991\nAlso, depend on the very fact that we\nhave these averages or these summaries or\n\n278\n00:16:09.991 --> 00:16:11.398\nwhatever else that we need.\n\n279\n00:16:11.398 --> 00:16:15.110\nBut there's times that we only need to\ndo those things when they meet certain\n\n280\n00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.980\nconditions too.\n\n281\n00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:16.770\nRight, Mike?\n\n282\n00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:19.910\n>> Absolutely and that's where our\nconditional formulas come in to play or\n\n283\n00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:24.230\nwhat we call conditional logic\nthat we use with our functions.\n\n284\n00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:27.320\nAnd they're almost the same,\nthey just add the word if to it.\n\n285\n00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:27.890\nAll right.\n\n286\n00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:31.830\nYou have sumif, right,\ninstead of sum we have sumif.\n\n287\n00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:36.900\nInstead of count we have countif, instead\nof average we have averageif, all right,\n\n288\n00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:41.120\nand there's even some they won't call out\non this exam I'll just give you a little\n\n289\n00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.010\nteaser.\n\n290\n00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:45.560\nThere's some ifs where I can\nhave more than one condition.\n\n291\n00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:46.990\nThere's count ifs.\n\n292\n00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:49.440\nSo count if for one condition.\n\n293\n00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:52.020\nCount ifs for more than one condition.\n\n294\n00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:52.728\nI might even show you.\n\n295\n00:16:52.728 --> 00:16:54.276\nWe might have some extra\ntime in this episode.\n\n296\n00:16:54.276 --> 00:16:56.916\nI might get a chance to show you that one,\nas well.\n\n297\n00:16:56.916 --> 00:16:58.040\nAll right, so let's take a look.\n\n298\n00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.300\nHere's another spreadsheet that I've got.\n\n299\n00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:00.830\nYou've seen this one before.\n\n300\n00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:02.548\nIt's got my sales for January.\n\n301\n00:17:02.548 --> 00:17:05.048\nIt's got the hospital name over\nhere that ordered the product.\n\n302\n00:17:05.048 --> 00:17:09.800\nThe date, the product, the quantity,\nthe unit price, and my total price.\n\n303\n00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:13.683\nAnd then I've set up a little area where\nI wanna start doing some summaries\n\n304\n00:17:13.683 --> 00:17:14.508\ninformation.\n\n305\n00:17:14.508 --> 00:17:16.580\nBut not on all the orders.\n\n306\n00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:19.180\nI don't wanna know how\nmany orders were placed.\n\n307\n00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:23.910\nI wanna know how many orders\nFlorida Hospital of Tampa placed.\n\n308\n00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:27.400\nAll right?\nSo somehow I have to get my function to\n\n309\n00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:32.760\nlook at this and\nonly count them if it's Florida Hospital.\n\n310\n00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.340\nDon't count them if it's Tampa General.\n\n311\n00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:36.390\nDon't count them if\nit's Memorial Hospital.\n\n312\n00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:37.090\nRight.\n\n313\n00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:40.740\nThat's where the ifs allow me to do,\nthat condition.\n\n314\n00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:45.550\nCount this record if the company is for\na hospital.\n\n315\n00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:48.108\nSounds complex, but\nit's extremely easy to do.\n\n316\n00:17:48.108 --> 00:17:50.148\nExcel makes it really easy.\n\n317\n00:17:50.148 --> 00:17:54.668\nSo let's go over here where I've got\nFlorida Hospital, and then Orders, right?\n\n318\n00:17:54.668 --> 00:17:58.938\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna type in,\nI'll start my function, and\n\n319\n00:17:58.938 --> 00:18:01.248\nformula always starts with an equals.\n\n320\n00:18:01.248 --> 00:18:08.150\nAll right, and I'm gonna say countif and\nthen open parentheses.\n\n321\n00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:10.878\nAnd you see the range and the criteria.\n\n322\n00:18:10.878 --> 00:18:13.720\nAll right,\nI get two things that I have to fill in.\n\n323\n00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.810\nThe first is the range.\n\n324\n00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:20.970\nNow what I'm gonna do for the range,\nthat's gonna be this column here.\n\n325\n00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:22.738\nSo, I'm just gonna select that column.\n\n326\n00:18:22.738 --> 00:18:24.418\nI'm gonna say look at this column.\n\n327\n00:18:24.418 --> 00:18:29.018\nThat's what range is saying is\nlook at this column, all right?\n\n328\n00:18:29.018 --> 00:18:32.758\nAnd then I'm gonna hit a comma,\nand what's the criteria?\n\n329\n00:18:32.758 --> 00:18:39.858\nWell, it's gotta equal this right here,\nH5, Florida Hospital Tampa.\n\n330\n00:18:39.858 --> 00:18:44.958\nI'll close my parentheses,\nI hit Enter, and I get 55.\n\n331\n00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:49.490\nSo that's telling me, and if we wanted to,\nwe could try to sort this.\n\n332\n00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:51.550\nLet's see if we can verify\nthose results here.\n\n333\n00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:52.945\nSort A to Z.\n\n334\n00:18:52.945 --> 00:18:59.750\nFlodia Hospital starts on two,\noops, goes all the way down to 56.\n\n335\n00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:03.110\nSo does that give me 55 total orders,\nright?\n\n336\n00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:04.189\nIf we do our math, so\n\n337\n00:19:04.189 --> 00:19:07.878\nyou can see that it is indeed counting\njust those Florida hospitals.\n\n338\n00:19:07.878 --> 00:19:13.098\nI'm going to undo my sort,\nso it doesn't look so easy.\n\n339\n00:19:13.098 --> 00:19:14.278\nShould we do that one again, Ronnie?\n\n340\n00:19:14.278 --> 00:19:15.100\nLet's do another one.\n\n341\n00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:20.228\nMemorial Hospital, so\nwe're going to say equals countif.\n\n342\n00:19:20.228 --> 00:19:23.329\nOops, let me zoom in for\nyou there as we fix that one.\n\n343\n00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:29.790\nSay equals countif, open parenthesis,\nwhat is it I want to count?\n\n344\n00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:34.780\nWell I want to count the orders, right?\n\n345\n00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:41.850\nWhat's the criteria I'm only gonna\ncount it if it says Memorial Hospital.\n\n346\n00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:44.180\nIf it says anything else, don't count it.\n\n347\n00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:47.660\nI close my parentheses,\nI hit Enter, and there we go.\n\n348\n00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.208\nMemorial Hospital has 52.\n\n349\n00:19:50.208 --> 00:19:54.250\nNow, can I do a series fill\nwith something crazy like this?\n\n350\n00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:54.750\nLet's see.\n\n351\n00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:57.900\nAbsolutely.\n\n352\n00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.370\nIt's just gonna change\nthe reference right?\n\n353\n00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:01.990\nIt's still gonna count column A.\n\n354\n00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:05.690\nI moved it down, so here,\n\n355\n00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:09.570\nbecause this is a column reference,\nthe entire column, it doesn't matter.\n\n356\n00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:12.880\nIt's not saying start at two and\ngo down to the end.\n\n357\n00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.448\nI don't know how many records there are.\n\n358\n00:20:14.448 --> 00:20:20.600\nSo I can't really say count from A2\nto A55 if there's 57 rows, right?\n\n359\n00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.170\nIt wouldn't count those last few.\n\n360\n00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:23.838\nSo I pick the entire column.\n\n361\n00:20:23.838 --> 00:20:26.540\nH7, I'm okay with that moving.\n\n362\n00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:27.260\nHere's H7.\n\n363\n00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:34.580\nWhen I drag that formula down to here,\nit's now looking for the criteria H8.\n\n364\n00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:35.460\nWhich is Tampa General.\n\n365\n00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:36.390\nAll right?\n\n366\n00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:39.328\nSo this is a case where that relative\nreference works perfect for me.\n\n367\n00:20:39.328 --> 00:20:43.228\nMove the formula down,\nmove the criteria down one.\n\n368\n00:20:43.228 --> 00:20:45.228\nAll right?\n\n369\n00:20:45.228 --> 00:20:46.840\nLet's try another one here.\n\n370\n00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.750\nLet's do quantity.\n\n371\n00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:54.160\nSo let's say we wanna know what the total\nquantity, they ordered 55 times.\n\n372\n00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.180\nWell how many individual\nitems did they order?\n\n373\n00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:58.110\nSome of those orders were for 14.\n\n374\n00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:59.880\nSome of them were for 78.\n\n375\n00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:04.790\nMaybe for some reason I need to know\nhow many total quantity they ordered.\n\n376\n00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:06.440\nWell, that's gonna be a sum, right?\n\n377\n00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:07.620\nI wanna add those up.\n\n378\n00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:09.640\nSo we could use our sum formula.\n\n379\n00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.970\nBut I've got a condition.\n\n380\n00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:15.520\nI only wanna add up the quantity\nif Florida Hospital ordered it.\n\n381\n00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:18.308\nIt's gonna work the exact same way.\n\n382\n00:21:18.308 --> 00:21:19.208\nLet's go over here.\n\n383\n00:21:19.208 --> 00:21:24.200\nWe're gonna say, equals soaps, sum if,\n\n384\n00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:27.260\nand open my parentheses.\n\n385\n00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:32.270\nSo now it says, well,\nwhat range are you gonna be adding up?\n\n386\n00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:35.020\nWell, I'm gonna be adding up the quantity,\nright,\n\n387\n00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:38.740\nI wanna know how many pieces they ordered,\nso that's my range.\n\n388\n00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:39.860\nWhat is my criteria?\n\n389\n00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:41.500\nI'm gonna put a comma.\n\n390\n00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:45.160\nMy criteria is, you know what,\nI did that wrong.\n\n391\n00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.190\nI almost did that backwards.\n\n392\n00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:49.160\nThe range is where you're\ngonna be looking for\n\n393\n00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.830\nthe criteria, not the value you wanna sum.\n\n394\n00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:52.988\nI said that incorrectly.\n\n395\n00:21:52.988 --> 00:21:53.788\nAll right?\n\n396\n00:21:53.788 --> 00:21:59.070\nSo the range is actually the company name,\nright?\n\n397\n00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:01.410\nSo the company name is my range.\n\n398\n00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:04.120\nComma, what is my criteria?\n\n399\n00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:08.690\nWell, it's needs, the company name,\nneeds to equal Florida Hospital Tampa.\n\n400\n00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:12.380\nAlright, and what am I gonna be adding?\n\n401\n00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:16.510\nIf it does equal Florida Hospital Tampa,\nwhat are you gonna be adding?\n\n402\n00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:19.360\nWell, I'm gonna add up\ntheir total quantity.\n\n403\n00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:23.237\nAll right, so I hit my end parenthesis,\nhit enter, and\n\n404\n00:22:23.237 --> 00:22:25.558\nI get there's the total number.\n\n405\n00:22:25.558 --> 00:22:29.398\nAnd if we wanted to verify that,\nlet's see how we could do that.\n\n406\n00:22:29.398 --> 00:22:32.754\nWell, I know we could\nsort this by hospital and\n\n407\n00:22:32.754 --> 00:22:37.160\nthen I could just select all of\nthe Florida Hospital Tampas.\n\n408\n00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:40.360\nOops, little too far.\n\n409\n00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:46.670\nAnd Excel says 2941 and\n\n410\n00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:50.828\nmy function says 2941.\n\n411\n00:22:50.828 --> 00:22:51.568\nRight.\n\n412\n00:22:51.568 --> 00:22:53.350\nSo it's doing exactly\nwhat it's supposed to do.\n\n413\n00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:59.060\nIt's creating a sum, but only if the\nhospital equals Flordia Hospital Tampa.\n\n414\n00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:00.480\nRight.\n\n415\n00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.050\nOne more time we'll do that.\n\n416\n00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:05.248\nSo let's see for\nMemorial Hospital, again, equals,\n\n417\n00:23:08.308 --> 00:23:13.196\nsumif, open parentheses,\nwhere you're gonna search for\n\n418\n00:23:13.196 --> 00:23:18.288\nyour criteria, name of the company,\nthat's my condition.\n\n419\n00:23:18.288 --> 00:23:23.075\nI'm gonna say if it\nequals Memorial Hospital,\n\n420\n00:23:23.075 --> 00:23:30.028\nthe criteria to look in that name\nof companies is Memorial Hospital.\n\n421\n00:23:30.028 --> 00:23:31.828\nWhat am I gonna sum up?\n\n422\n00:23:31.828 --> 00:23:35.128\nI want to sum up the quantity.\n\n423\n00:23:35.128 --> 00:23:36.748\nI close my parenthesis.\n\n424\n00:23:36.748 --> 00:23:38.600\nI hit Enter and we're good to go.\n\n425\n00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.130\nThen I'll just series fill for\nthe rest of that one,\n\n426\n00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:43.200\nor auto-fill for the rest of that one.\n\n427\n00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.220\nAll right?\n\n428\n00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:48.420\nSo a couple of examples of using those,\nthat conditional logic.\n\n429\n00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:53.830\nThere's another one we can do and\nthat's the average.\n\n430\n00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:55.824\nWe can do an average as well.\n\n431\n00:23:55.824 --> 00:24:00.203\nSo we'll go over here\nto average quantity and\n\n432\n00:24:00.203 --> 00:24:04.244\nsay equals and then average if All right.\n\n433\n00:24:04.244 --> 00:24:08.030\nLet me just zoom in for you guys there.\n\n434\n00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:10.792\nKeyboard malfunction, there we go.\n\n435\n00:24:10.792 --> 00:24:15.364\nAverageif, open parenthesis.\n\n436\n00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:19.520\nYour qualification, or where are you\ngonna look for that condition?\n\n437\n00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.170\nIt's gonna be, and I'm gonna zoom out,\nthat's a little too close.\n\n438\n00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:27.578\nThat's gonna be let's scroll back over.\n\n439\n00:24:27.578 --> 00:24:31.600\nLike company name, all right.\n\n440\n00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:36.940\nI'm gonna say if,\nmy range is column A the criteria\n\n441\n00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:42.770\nis the company name needs to be\nFlorida Hospital, and what am I averaging?\n\n442\n00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:45.350\nWell in this case I want\nan average of the quantity.\n\n443\n00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:47.840\nSo I'll select that quantity column.\n\n444\n00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:49.881\nClose my parentheses, hit enter.\n\n445\n00:24:49.881 --> 00:24:55.468\nAnd now I know on average they order 53\nitems every time they place and order.\n\n446\n00:24:55.468 --> 00:24:56.162\nAll right.\n\n447\n00:24:56.162 --> 00:25:00.270\nSo the kinda information that I\ncan pull out of that raw data\n\n448\n00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:03.910\nby using these functions\nthat we have in Excel.\n\n449\n00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:05.590\nNow I don't really care\nif they order 53.4.\n\n450\n00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:11.390\nSo, I'm just going to drop a couple\nof decimal points on that guy there.\n\n451\n00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:12.780\nAll right.\n\n452\n00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:16.960\nAnd then of course I'll just\nfill it in the rest of the way.\n\n453\n00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.440\nFor the amount it would be the same thing,\nright?\n\n454\n00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:24.400\nIf I go equals averageif.\n\n455\n00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:27.220\nOpen parentheses, what is the range?\n\n456\n00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:31.386\nWell the range is going\nto be company name.\n\n457\n00:25:33.834 --> 00:25:37.880\nAnd my criteria,\nI wanted to match Florida Hospital.\n\n458\n00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:42.980\nAnd what am I going to get an average of?\n\n459\n00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:43.743\nTotal price.\n\n460\n00:25:45.805 --> 00:25:48.580\nAnd I'll close my parentheses.\n\n461\n00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:53.472\nI'll hit enter, and I now know that on\naverage when they placed an order they\n\n462\n00:25:53.472 --> 00:25:56.260\nspent close to $3,000 per order.\n\n463\n00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:59.440\nAgain, an example of the information\nthat would be difficult for\n\n464\n00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:02.610\nme to get just by looking\nat this raw data.\n\n465\n00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:07.270\nBut very easy if I use my functions and\nmy formulas properly.\n\n466\n00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:07.770\nRight.\n\n467\n00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.470\nLet's see what else can we do.\n\n468\n00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:11.210\nWe did the countif.\n\n469\n00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:12.070\nWe did the averageif.\n\n470\n00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.940\nWe did the sumif.\n\n471\n00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:16.070\nThat's most of them Ronnie.\n\n472\n00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:19.400\nWe could do, remember I told you,\nwe could do some ifs,\n\n473\n00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.889\nsome multiple statements as well\nas we could try to do that.\n\n474\n00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:26.390\nLet's see if I can come of\nan example on the fly here.\n\n475\n00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:31.929\nWhat if we wanna pay a bonus\nto our sales people but\n\n476\n00:26:31.929 --> 00:26:40.190\nwe've gotta, only if their month is\nabove the average for everybody?\n\n477\n00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:41.500\nHoo, that's scary.\n\n478\n00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:42.210\nCan I do that, Ronnie?\n\n479\n00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:43.510\nCan we do that here live on TV?\n\n480\n00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:44.370\n>> Sure, let's do it.\n\n481\n00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:45.750\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\nLet's try.\n\n482\n00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:49.960\nSo what we need to do is we would need\nto first figure out what the average was\n\n483\n00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:50.855\nof all the sales.\n\n484\n00:26:50.855 --> 00:26:52.980\nCuz that'll be our bar, right?\n\n485\n00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:55.090\nSo let's come over here,\nand we'll figure that out.\n\n486\n00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:56.870\nHow can we figure out the average?\n\n487\n00:26:56.870 --> 00:27:01.790\nWell, we know that equals average.\n\n488\n00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:04.280\nOpen parentheses, what numbers?\n\n489\n00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:07.580\nNow I can't do an average of the averages,\nright?\n\n490\n00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:11.650\nThat's not gonna give me the same answer\nas doing an average of the raw data.\n\n491\n00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:15.984\nThat would be inaccurate, so\nwe'll select all of our data here.\n\n492\n00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:21.330\nThere we go.\n\n493\n00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:25.760\nAnd we'll close the parentheses and\nwe'll hit enter.\n\n494\n00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.200\nSo we knew how to do that already.\n\n495\n00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.700\nAnd let's move that down.\n\n496\n00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.700\nI'll just move it here, and\nwe're gonna say average.\n\n497\n00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:38.870\nSo our average sale per month by\nan individual sales person is $2,820.\n\n498\n00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:39.420\nAll right.\nSo\n\n499\n00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:44.150\nnow that we got the average of all of the\nmonthly sales there, we need to, we wanna\n\n500\n00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:49.740\npay them a bonus only on the months\nthat they were above the average right.\n\n501\n00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:52.360\nSo that's gonna be that sumif.\n\n502\n00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:56.220\nWe're going to have to add\nup their monthly totals but\n\n503\n00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:58.930\nonly those months that\nare above the average.\n\n504\n00:27:58.930 --> 00:27:59.600\nAll right.\n\n505\n00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:03.040\nSo we could write a formula\nthat look like this.\n\n506\n00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.410\nNow this is take two on here.\n\n507\n00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:07.290\nI'll show you where I goofed\nup on that first one.\n\n508\n00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:08.812\nI'm gonna do a sumif.\n\n509\n00:28:08.812 --> 00:28:10.180\nAll right.\n\n510\n00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:11.790\nOpen parenthesis.\n\n511\n00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:16.700\nThe range that we're gonna be\nlooking at is in this case Rogers.\n\n512\n00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:18.340\nWe named it earlier.\n\n513\n00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:20.264\nBut you could use your normal references,\nright.\n\n514\n00:28:20.264 --> 00:28:23.480\nB3 through M3 comma.\n\n515\n00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:28.117\nMy criteria,\nit needs to be greater than the average.\n\n516\n00:28:28.117 --> 00:28:32.030\nSo what I was doing was greater than S6,\nright.\n\n517\n00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:33.040\nThis cell over here.\n\n518\n00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.650\nOops.\nLet me try that again.\n\n519\n00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:35.850\nI missed my greater than symbol.\n\n520\n00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:37.990\nGreater than S6.\n\n521\n00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:41.960\nThe problem with this\nlittle reference right here\n\n522\n00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:46.080\nis that the greater than symbol\nneeds to be treated as a string.\n\n523\n00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:50.400\nBut if you put quotes around the whole\nthing to indicate that it's a string,\n\n524\n00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:53.944\nit's now looking to see if any of\nthese values are greater than S6.\n\n525\n00:28:53.944 --> 00:28:55.590\nI don't know what S6 is, right.\n\n526\n00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:59.360\nIt's not looking at the actual cell, it's\nlooking at the letter S and the number 6.\n\n527\n00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.640\nSo I gotta tell it this\npart is not a string.\n\n528\n00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.890\nSo here's how we do that.\n\n529\n00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:08.220\nWe're gonna put quotes around\njust the greater than symbol and\n\n530\n00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:10.550\nthen we're gonna glue that together.\n\n531\n00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:11.910\nAnd see how it turned red?\n\n532\n00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:14.180\nNow you can see that it is\nan actual cell reference.\n\n533\n00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:18.330\nAnd if I zoom out,\nwe should see in my formula that,\n\n534\n00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:20.620\nnow it sees that cell, right?\n\n535\n00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:23.016\nSo greater than S6.\n\n536\n00:29:23.016 --> 00:29:27.866\nAnd then, because the range and\nthe sum range are the same,\n\n537\n00:29:27.866 --> 00:29:31.800\nI don't have to define them twice, right?\n\n538\n00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:33.360\nThe range is Rogers.\n\n539\n00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.880\nWhat numbers do I want to add up for\nthe sum range?\n\n540\n00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:39.110\nIs also Rogers So\nI don't really need to add that up.\n\n541\n00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:43.608\nSo I hit my n parenthesis and OK.\n\n542\n00:29:43.608 --> 00:29:46.798\nAnd so now it's telling me $18,000.\n\n543\n00:29:46.798 --> 00:29:50.400\nWell that sounds a little steep for\na bonus, right?\n\n544\n00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:55.220\nThat's because we're not paying him\nthe actual amount that he sold that month.\n\n545\n00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:57.630\nWe're paying him 5% of that amount.\n\n546\n00:29:57.630 --> 00:30:00.970\nSo I still need to take this whole thing.\n\n547\n00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:02.888\nAnd multiply it by 5%.\n\n548\n00:30:02.888 --> 00:30:06.620\nNow, multiplications typically first, but\n\n549\n00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:10.560\nI wanna make sure I'm careful\nwith that order of operations.\n\n550\n00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:15.905\nSo what I like to do is put those\nwhole thing in parenthesis.\n\n551\n00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:19.520\nRight.\nAnd I can zoom in so you can see that.\n\n552\n00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:25.220\nI'm taking that whole sumif function,\nand putting it inside parenthesis.\n\n553\n00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:28.490\nSaying hey, do this first, all right?\n\n554\n00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:33.750\nThen multiply that by 5%.\n\n555\n00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:34.350\nAll right.\n\n556\n00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:35.030\nThen what I'm gonna do?\n\n557\n00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:38.850\nCuz I know I wanna use this formula for\nthe rest of those sales people and\n\n558\n00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:42.820\nif I move that formula down, this box\nright here's gonna move down, right?\n\n559\n00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:43.620\nAnd I don't want that.\n\n560\n00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:48.040\nI need that to stay, so\nwe'll make that an absolute reference.\n\n561\n00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:50.569\nWe'll do our little F4, right?\n\n562\n00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:56.740\nThis one also needs to stay because that's\nnot gonna move as I move that formula\n\n563\n00:30:56.740 --> 00:31:00.340\ndown, so we're gonna make that one\nan absolute reference as well.\n\n564\n00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:03.990\nAnd then we'll keep our fingers\ncrossed and we'll hit enter.\n\n565\n00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:06.740\nAnd we can zoom in just so\nyou can see that final formula or\n\n566\n00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:08.600\nshould we'll make sure it\nworks before we show you?\n\n567\n00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.500\nWe'll zoom back out.\n\n568\n00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.080\nWe'll hit enter.\n\n569\n00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.970\nAnd that looks a little bit better.\n\n570\n00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:15.360\nHe's gonna get $900 bonus.\n\n571\n00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:18.390\nSo, that was really,\na little bit complex maybe for\n\n572\n00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:20.600\nwhere we're at in our Excel lessons.\n\n573\n00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.590\nBut I wanted to show you how you can\nstart combining all the things that we're\n\n574\n00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:24.720\nlearning here.\n\n575\n00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:27.220\nRight.\nWe're learning that sumif function.\n\n576\n00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:30.480\nAnd so we've got that tied in\nhere based on a condition.\n\n577\n00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.740\nAnd then we're learning\nthat order of operations.\n\n578\n00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:36.970\nI wanna make sure this is done first\nbefore it does any multiplication.\n\n579\n00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:39.570\nWe're learning about those\nabsolute references.\n\n580\n00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:44.790\nSo now as I move this formula down, right.\n\n581\n00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:47.840\nOops it should not copy like that.\n\n582\n00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:48.820\nLet's see here.\n\n583\n00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:49.380\nLet's delete.\n\n584\n00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:53.300\nRemember that delete key is not a delete.\n\n585\n00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:57.534\nYou must clear those contents.\n\n586\n00:31:57.534 --> 00:32:01.097\nAnd I believe I'm going\nto run into an issue with\n\n587\n00:32:01.097 --> 00:32:03.689\nmy Rodgers there not moving down.\n\n588\n00:32:03.689 --> 00:32:05.152\nWhy is it not doing that?\n\n589\n00:32:05.152 --> 00:32:08.790\nEverybody's getting paid the same\nbonus for them this case.\n\n590\n00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:09.975\nNow I'm kidding.\n\n591\n00:32:09.975 --> 00:32:14.960\nWe'd have to figure out why it's\nnot moving that reference down.\n\n592\n00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:20.490\nSo I need to come over here and\ndo something like this.\n\n593\n00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:21.280\nLet's do this.\n\n594\n00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:26.620\nLet's move that down My named reference\nis gonna cause me a problem in this case.\n\n595\n00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:32.330\nSo what I wanna do is change\nthis to B4 through M4.\n\n596\n00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:39.800\nAll right, so\nyou can see that range is selected.\n\n597\n00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:40.780\nI'll hit Enter.\n\n598\n00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:42.250\nThat looks a little bit better.\n\n599\n00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:45.720\nNow as I drag this down,\nthese should not change.\n\n600\n00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:48.330\nBut these should change\nas I move that down.\n\n601\n00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:50.510\nSo I drag that down and there we go.\n\n602\n00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:52.630\nIn that case it was that named range.\n\n603\n00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:53.740\nIt was saying, hey,\n\n604\n00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:56.850\nI'm going to focus on this name\nrange even if you move that formula.\n\n605\n00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:58.640\nWhich is a lot of times what we want,\nright?\n\n606\n00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:02.500\nNormally we're giving this a name called\nbonus, and it's never going to move.\n\n607\n00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:04.000\nWe're giving this a name called average.\n\n608\n00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.150\nAnd it's never gonna move.\n\n609\n00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:07.930\nIn this case,\nthe name range actually hurt me,\n\n610\n00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:10.610\nbecause the reference didn't\nmove when I moved the formula.\n\n611\n00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:15.710\nBut just an example of how we can start,\nas you learn these basic steps,\n\n612\n00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:17.100\nyou might think,\ngosh this stuff is so easy.\n\n613\n00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:19.030\nHe's teaching us how to do a sum.\n\n614\n00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:22.060\nHe's teaching us how to do a count and\nan average.\n\n615\n00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:24.420\nBut you can start combining\nthese techniques and\n\n616\n00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:26.490\nget some really powerful results, Ronnie.\n\n617\n00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:28.260\n>> Yeah, and\nthe same thing actually goes here.\n\n618\n00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:31.950\nThat named range really becomes\nan absolute reference in your workbooks.\n\n619\n00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:36.190\nAnd what ends up happening is say hey, use\nthis range, regardless of what happens.\n\n620\n00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:39.410\nAnd even if you drag down, you're\nsaying hey, in the original formula.\n\n621\n00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:42.595\nYou had an absolute reference just like\nyou put those dollar signs around, and\n\n622\n00:33:42.595 --> 00:33:46.860\nnamed range is kind of alias for\nan absolute reference, so that happens to.\n\n623\n00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:51.410\nSo, in this episode we did take a look\nat some very foundational functions, but\n\n624\n00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:55.250\nthe goal behind that was not just so\nyou could do an average or a sum, but\n\n625\n00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:59.070\nto show you how to actually use those\nfunctions inside of an Excel workbook.\n\n626\n00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:03.390\nThen what Mike also did is show us how we\ncould actually use the same things, but\n\n627\n00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:07.040\nadding in a criteria or\na condition to actually say,\n\n628\n00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:10.950\nhey, we only want it to happen if it\ndoes meet the criteria that we need.\n\n629\n00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:14.025\nAnd And\nthis is really where we begin, right?\n\n630\n00:34:14.025 --> 00:34:18.225\nIs that we realize,\njust don't simple things is not enough,\n\n631\n00:34:18.225 --> 00:34:21.485\nbecause we need to see the data in the way\nthat we're actually asked to see the data.\n\n632\n00:34:21.485 --> 00:34:24.365\nAnd if you're gonna be working with Excel,\nthat is the key.\n\n633\n00:34:24.365 --> 00:34:28.065\nThat is what will actually make\nyou more proficient at it, and\n\n634\n00:34:28.065 --> 00:34:30.980\nactually makes you more\nvaluable to your company too.\n\n635\n00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:33.550\nSo Mike, thank you again for\nthose examples.\n\n636\n00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:36.630\nThat's a great place for\nus to go ahead and end this episode then.\n\n637\n00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:39.450\nSigning off for

00:00:20.487\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and today we're\ntaking a look at Microsoft Excel 2016.\n\n4\n00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:23.800\nNow we're specifically gonna be\ndealing with some different functions.\n\n5\n00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.380\nA lot of times, what ends up happening,\n\n6\n00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.700\nis that you get data that you are now\nworking with spreadsheets, and\n\n7\n00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.280\nyou start noticing different things with\nthe text instead, of just the numbers.\n\n8\n00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.820\nYou might notice things that\nare all in capital letters, and\n\n9\n00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.800\nthey need to be put in proper case.\n\n10\n00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.774\nFields that are actually all\ntogether in some way or another, and\n\n11\n00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:42.194\nyou need to separate them out.\n\n12\n00:00:42.194 --> 00:00:45.565\nAnd you have only one recourse right\nnow if you don't know about functions,\n\n13\n00:00:45.565 --> 00:00:47.101\nwhich is to manually type them in.\n\n14\n00:00:47.101 --> 00:00:51.536\nBut the great thing is, we have Mr. Mike\nRoderick with us, and he's going to help\n\n15\n00:00:51.536 --> 00:00:55.937\nus see all these different functions that\nwe can actually use to help us out here.\n\n16\n00:00:55.937 --> 00:00:57.930\n>> Absolutely, and\nit is one of those things.\n\n17\n00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.143\nAnd thanks for having me Ronnie.\n\n18\n00:01:00.143 --> 00:01:03.095\nWhen you're dealing with Excel, typically\nwe're dealing with numbers, right.\n\n19\n00:01:03.095 --> 00:01:07.889\nAnd when we think of formulas and\nfunctions, we think of things like sums\n\n20\n00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:13.040\nand countifs and deviations or averages or\nwhatever the case may be, right.\n\n21\n00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.960\nCrunching those numbers, that's what\nExcel excels at, pardon the pun there.\n\n22\n00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.390\nBut we have to deal with other types\nof data in our spreadsheets as well.\n\n23\n00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.080\nVery commonly, we've got text in there,\nwe have names,\n\n24\n00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.730\nmonths, products, things like that.\n\n25\n00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.910\nSo we do need to be able\nto deal with text and\n\n26\n00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.180\nsometimes even numbers\nare gonna be treated as text.\n\n27\n00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.390\nYou know, the old rule of thumb is if\nyou're not gonna be doing mathematical\n\n28\n00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.120\ncalculations, you should\nnot format it as a number.\n\n29\n00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.680\nLike a zip code really\nshould be formatted as text.\n\n30\n00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.910\nIt's not gonna hurt it to\nformat it as a number and\n\n31\n00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.510\nthere are definitely some\nspecial formats that you can do.\n\n32\n00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.608\nBut phone numbers, zip codes,\nemployee ID's, things like that,\n\n33\n00:01:57.608 --> 00:01:58.960\nthat's really text.\n\n34\n00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.460\nJust because it's a digit,\na numerical digit,\n\n35\n00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.180\ndoesn't mean we're going to be dividing by\nit or multiplying or anything like that.\n\n36\n00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.360\nSo, a lot of times we will just\nnot bother formatting as a number,\n\n37\n00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.580\njust leave it as general, or\nmaybe we actually format it as text\n\n38\n00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.190\nto get it to a line like text normally\ndoes to the left hand side or\n\n39\n00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.280\nwhatever the case may be or\nto start plugging things together, right?\n\n40\n00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.723\nTo cancadnate, I'll use a fancy term\nthat we'll define here in a little bit.\n\n41\n00:02:25.723 --> 00:02:29.176\nTo be able to plug those things\ntogether not mathematically, but\n\n42\n00:02:29.176 --> 00:02:31.937\ntaking an area code and\na seven digit phone number and\n\n43\n00:02:31.937 --> 00:02:35.612\nplugging those together,\nwe could use our text functions for that.\n\n44\n00:02:35.612 --> 00:02:40.034\nSo there's a bunch of them built into\nExcel I'm gonna go over the ones that they\n\n45\n00:02:40.034 --> 00:02:44.322\ncall out on the exams specifically and\nthat I think are ones that we typically\n\n46\n00:02:44.322 --> 00:02:47.660\nend up using in a day to\nday working with Excel.\n\n47\n00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.460\n>> Now, Mike, when we start taking a look\nat and when we're talking about as far as\n\n48\n00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.070\nthe text functions go, a lot of times it\nis because we do get data that was entered\n\n49\n00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.950\nin, and sometimes we don't\nknow how old that data is.\n\n50\n00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.040\nAnd so what you might see is different\nfields and formats that have happened over\n\n51\n00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.590\ntime on the same column, and\nthey're now coming to you.\n\n52\n00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.878\nAnd what you need to do is be able to\nseparate out some of that data that's in\n\n53\n00:03:07.878 --> 00:03:09.587\nthat field and put it somewhere else.\n\n54\n00:03:09.587 --> 00:03:11.563\nAnd we have functions that help\nus to deal with that, right?\n\n55\n00:03:11.563 --> 00:03:12.390\n>> We do, exactly.\n\n56\n00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.870\nSo let's just dive right in, here.\n\n57\n00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.080\nI've got a spreadsheet open, and\n\n58\n00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.750\nwe're gonna start with these functions\nknown as right, left and mid.\n\n59\n00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.590\nAnd what these allow me to do\nis take a part of a string.\n\n60\n00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.520\nAnd let's define a string.\n\n61\n00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.100\nA string just being a string of\ncharacters, again, alphanumeric, right.\n\n62\n00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.150\nIt does not have to be strictly letters,\nbut like my phone number here that\n\n63\n00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.080\nI've got typed out is going to be what\nwe would call alphanumeric text, right.\n\n64\n00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.600\nSo let's look at my sheet.\n\n65\n00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.210\nAnd what I wanna do with,\nagain there's right, left and mid.\n\n66\n00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.060\nAnd what these allow you to do,\n\n67\n00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.830\njust kinda their name really\ntells you what we're gonna do.\n\n68\n00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.140\nRight is gonna allow me to take\npart of that string from the right,\n\n69\n00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.540\nI'm gonna start on the right-hand\nside of that value, and\n\n70\n00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.920\nI'm gonna count characters over,\nand I'm gonna grab just that part.\n\n71\n00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.620\nLeft would start from the left side,\nand it would take so\n\n72\n00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.740\nmany characters, all right.\n\n73\n00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.380\nMid allows me to start somewhere in the\nmiddle, and then grab so many characters.\n\n74\n00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.530\nSo what we're gonna do, in this\ncase I've got phone numbers, right?\n\n75\n00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.850\nAnd somebody has entered this\ndata in with the area code.\n\n76\n00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.530\nAnd let's say we don't want the area code\nor we wanna be able to sort by area code,\n\n77\n00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.670\nso I need to get these separated, right?\n\n78\n00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.085\nWhat I wanna do here is just grab\nthe seven digit phone number and\n\n79\n00:04:28.085 --> 00:04:30.763\nI wanna put that in a separate column.\n\n80\n00:04:30.763 --> 00:04:35.644\nSo, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nwrite a function equals right\n\n81\n00:04:35.644 --> 00:04:39.836\nbecause we're gonna start\nfrom the right-hand side.\n\n82\n00:04:39.836 --> 00:04:45.446\nSo =right(, what text am I looking\nat to get these characters,\n\n83\n00:04:45.446 --> 00:04:49.270\nand I tell it this cell right here.\n\n84\n00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.030\nI put a comma in there, and\nthen number of characters.\n\n85\n00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.268\nHow many characters do I want?\n\n86\n00:04:54.268 --> 00:04:58.219\nWell, in this case, I've got four digits,\na hyphen and then three more digits if\n\n87\n00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:02.077\nI'm starting from the right, for\na total of, what, eight characters there?\n\n88\n00:05:02.077 --> 00:05:06.020\nSo I tell it I want eight\ncharacters from the right,\n\n89\n00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.380\nclose my parentheses,\nhit enter and there we go.\n\n90\n00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.070\nI now have just the phone\nnumber without the area code.\n\n91\n00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.650\nAnd then, of course,\nI could do a little series fill or\n\n92\n00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.500\nautofill on that and\nI can take that all the way down.\n\n93\n00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.590\n>> All right, now, Mike, does this\nactually matter if the text field or\n\n94\n00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.700\nthe field that you're talking about,\nlike the phone number.\n\n95\n00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.790\nIf somebody had put in like a phone number\nlike a one, in certain ones like before\n\n96\n00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.850\nthe phone number like you're\ndialing long distance or\n\n97\n00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.770\nnot when you do something\nin the right function here.\n\n98\n00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.470\n>> It really doesn't because\nit's starting from the right and\n\n99\n00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.140\nit's counting over eight characters.\n\n100\n00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.310\nIt doesn't matter what is past\nthat eight character right.\n\n101\n00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.550\nSome of those numbers might have a one out\nin front of them, some of them might not.\n\n102\n00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.175\nIn fact that would be a good\nuse of a formula like this.\n\n103\n00:05:49.175 --> 00:05:50.795\nLet me undo all of that.\n\n104\n00:05:50.795 --> 00:05:53.705\nAnd let's say we go in here and\nmodify a couple of these.\n\n105\n00:05:53.705 --> 00:05:59.205\nI'll put a one in front of that one and\na one in front of this one.\n\n106\n00:05:59.205 --> 00:06:03.650\nAnd I'll put a one out here in\nfront of this one, all right.\n\n107\n00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.000\nAnd let's say that all of our\nnumbers use a country code of one so\n\n108\n00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.610\nwe typically don't put\nthe country code in.\n\n109\n00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.150\nBut some people have copied and pasted it\nor they pulled data from another source\n\n110\n00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.190\nthat had that country code in there,\nI had inconsistent data now.\n\n111\n00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.160\nSome of them have the country\ncode some of them do not.\n\n112\n00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.390\nHow do I fix that?\n\n113\n00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.410\nWell I could go through and\njust remove the one but\n\n114\n00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.300\nif I've got thousands of records to go\nthrough, it's gonna be very inefficient.\n\n115\n00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.050\nSo what we would do is we'd write\na formula, say equals right,\n\n116\n00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.660\ncuz I know I want from the right I can\ntell it how many characters I want and\n\n117\n00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.750\nthen I can cut the rest of it off, right?\n\n118\n00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.540\nTake my number, let me zoom in so\nyou can see that.\n\n119\n00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:46.070\nRight, take the text that I want to\npull the characters from, comma,\n\n120\n00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.810\nhow many characters?\n\n121\n00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:48.850\nNow here, I've gotta count them up, right?\n\n122\n00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:53.550\nI've got four digits and then I've\ngot a hyphen and then I've got three\n\n123\n00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:58.497\nmore digits, so we're up to eight and\nthen I've got a space that's nine.\n\n124\n00:06:58.497 --> 00:07:02.793\nI've got an open parentheses, that's ten,\nanother parentheses, that's eleven and\n\n125\n00:07:02.793 --> 00:07:06.016\nthen three for the area code,\n12, 13, 14, is that right?\n\n126\n00:07:06.016 --> 00:07:08.298\nIf my math is correct,\nI ran out of fingers to count on so\n\n127\n00:07:08.298 --> 00:07:09.800\nI'm having trouble there.\n\n128\n00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.620\nSo I tell it 14 and\nI close the parenthesis and I hit enter.\n\n129\n00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.900\nAnd now you see it doesn't look\nany different for this one.\n\n130\n00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.960\nBut as I series fill this guy or auto\nfill, the ones that used to have a country\n\n131\n00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:26.540\ncode now do not, and\nI've got good, consistent data.\n\n132\n00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.860\nAnd then what I would do at this point,\nI'll show you a little trick.\n\n133\n00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.790\nNow here's the thing,\nwhen you use formulas like this,\n\n134\n00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:36.340\nkeep in mind the difference between\ndisplayed content and actual content.\n\n135\n00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.910\nWhat I'm seeing in this\ncell is a phone number.\n\n136\n00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:44.180\nWhat's actually in the cell is a function,\nright?\n\n137\n00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.180\nSo what would happen if\nthis cell went away.\n\n138\n00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.230\nLike I wanna delete this column not\nbecause I've got the phone numbers the way\n\n139\n00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.890\nI want them.\n\n140\n00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:52.459\nOkay, great,\nlet's just delete that column.\n\n141\n00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:58.120\nUh-oh, now I've got a problem, right.\n\n142\n00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.863\nBecause the phone number wasn't\nstored in that second column,\n\n143\n00:08:00.863 --> 00:08:02.912\nit was a formula referring\nto the first column.\n\n144\n00:08:02.912 --> 00:08:05.641\nNow that the first column's\ngone It's saying hey,\n\n145\n00:08:05.641 --> 00:08:08.567\nwhat do you want me to take\nthe right 14 characters of?\n\n146\n00:08:08.567 --> 00:08:10.890\nThere's nothing there, right?\n\n147\n00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.550\nSo you do have to be careful with that,\nI'll show you how to get around it.\n\n148\n00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:17.580\nWhat I typically do once I've\nwritten my formula like this,\n\n149\n00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.950\nif I need to get rid of the original data,\nI've got to convert this from the formula.\n\n150\n00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:25.730\nSo I'll take this entire column and\nI'll copy it.\n\n151\n00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:33.000\nAnd then all I'm gonna do is paste it,\nbut I'm gonna do a paste values.\n\n152\n00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.660\nRemember that trick we learned\nback a few episodes ago?\n\n153\n00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:40.200\nPaste values right on top\nof where the formulas were.\n\n154\n00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:47.030\nNow, displayed content and\nactual content is the same.\n\n155\n00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:51.900\nIt's no longer a formula, or excuse me,\na function referencing column A.\n\n156\n00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:56.130\nSo I can delete column A,\nand my numbers stay.\n\n157\n00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.850\nOops, sorry wrong key.\n\n158\n00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:01.070\nZoom back out, there we go.\n\n159\n00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:04.980\nSo something you've gotta keep in mind\nwhen you write these kind of formulas,\n\n160\n00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.380\nit doesn't replace\nthe cell with the value.\n\n161\n00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.720\nThe formula's there and it's just\ndisplaying the results of the formula.\n\n162\n00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.950\nIf you get rid of the source data,\nyour formula's gonna fail.\n\n163\n00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:18.230\nSometimes you're okay, the source\ndata's gonna stay there anyway, so\n\n164\n00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:22.170\nyou don't don't worry about the fact that\nit's a formula and not the actual value.\n\n165\n00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.610\nBut if you're gonna eliminate that first\ncolumn, you first gotta make sure you've\n\n166\n00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:29.230\ngot a good copy of those values so\nyour functions don't fail.\n\n167\n00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:33.140\n>> Now Mike, you showed us the right\nfunction there that allows us to\n\n168\n00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.720\nextract that number from\nthe right-hand side.\n\n169\n00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:40.460\nSo it seemed logical that left would\nactually do the same thing from left side\n\n170\n00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.180\nbut, would we actually have to worry\nabout anything new from that if\n\n171\n00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:43.910\nwe were to do that?\n\n172\n00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:44.640\n>> No, you really don't.\n\n173\n00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.810\nIt's the exact same thing.\n\n174\n00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:49.350\nWith left,\nI'm gonna start from the left side, and\n\n175\n00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:51.570\ntell it how many characters to count over.\n\n176\n00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:56.110\nSo why use one or the other,\nwell it really depends on your data.\n\n177\n00:09:56.110 --> 00:10:00.550\nIf I know, I'm trying to think\nof a good way to show you this.\n\n178\n00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:01.320\nLet's see.\n\n179\n00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:05.530\nWell, if we went back and\nlet me just do a couple undoes here.\n\n180\n00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:08.330\nSo here right before I did that column.\n\n181\n00:10:12.031 --> 00:10:17.060\nI could try to do a left but in this case,\nI want the data that's on the right.\n\n182\n00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:18.570\nSo that's not gonna work.\n\n183\n00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:20.870\nLet's say I had a name field.\n\n184\n00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.400\nLet's see if I had something like that.\n\n185\n00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:26.280\nOr a good example would be states.\n\n186\n00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.190\nI don't think I have a list of states.\n\n187\n00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:31.570\nBut let's say I wanted to chop that off,\nI wanted to just have two letters for\n\n188\n00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:34.170\nthe state instead of\nthe entire state name.\n\n189\n00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:38.450\nWell you might think I could start from\nthe right or the left, it wouldn't matter.\n\n190\n00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:40.730\nThe problem is state names\nare different lengths.\n\n191\n00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:42.520\nSo if you're gonna start from the right,\n\n192\n00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.820\nhow many characters do you go\nover to only have two left?\n\n193\n00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:50.682\nWell on Florida, F-L-O-R-I-D-A,\nthat's seven characters.\n\n194\n00:10:50.682 --> 00:10:53.170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You'd have to go over five.\n\n195\n00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:55.920\nBut on Iowa,\nyou'd only take off two from the right.\n\n196\n00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.010\nSo it's not consistent\nthrough all your data.\n\n197\n00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:01.540\nSo you can't start from the right,\nyou'd have to start from the left.\n\n198\n00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:05.290\nIt just depends on what you're trying to\ndo with it, cuz you've gotta figure out\n\n199\n00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:08.880\na way that I can do the same thing to\nall those fields in that column and\n\n200\n00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:09.970\nend up with the right results.\n\n201\n00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:12.980\nSo just where is the data you want\nis on the right or is on the left or\n\n202\n00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.940\nwhat is the easiest way to count it out.\n\n203\n00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:19.030\nLike this one here for\nexample, with the zip code,\n\n204\n00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:24.030\nthis is a zip code that has the last four,\nthat whole thing.\n\n205\n00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:26.810\nBut in our mail system\nwe don't support it so\n\n206\n00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:30.349\nI need to get rid of the last four and\nthat hyphen.\n\n207\n00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.660\nI could try to figure out a way to start\nfrom the right because it is pretty\n\n208\n00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:38.000\nconsistent, it's always four\ndigits plus a dash, but\n\n209\n00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.670\nthat's not the part I want to keep.\n\n210\n00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:42.720\nI want to keep the first\nfive digits over here.\n\n211\n00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.020\nSo in this case it's easier\nto start from the left.\n\n212\n00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:50.200\nI'm going to say =left(,\n\n213\n00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:55.820\nwhat text do I want to take the characters\nfrom comma how many characters do I want,\n\n214\n00:11:55.820 --> 00:12:00.520\nin this case five,\nclose my parentheses, hit enter, and\n\n215\n00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.240\nI'm left with just the zip Code.\n\n216\n00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.060\nSo then I would do a series fill\nto bring that all the way down for\n\n217\n00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:06.550\nthe rest of my data.\n\n218\n00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.770\nI would then copy, and\n\n219\n00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:15.320\nthen I would do my paste special,\nor paste values.\n\n220\n00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.130\nAnd then I can get rid of this column.\n\n221\n00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.250\nAnd I'm left with just\nthose zip codes there.\n\n222\n00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:24.670\nSo right and\nleft is just a matter of telling you hey,\n\n223\n00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:26.620\nwhich side do you wanna start from.\n\n224\n00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:28.930\nHow many characters do you\nwant me to count out, and\n\n225\n00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:30.730\neverything else gets removed.\n\n226\n00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.150\n>> Nice.\n>> So very easy to do.\n\n227\n00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:37.260\n>> Mike, I can see the use of this is I\nwas trying to, say, create user names,\n\n228\n00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:41.190\nwhere I wanted a first initial,\nlast name, something like that.\n\n229\n00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:45.850\nAnd I just need to extract that one\ncharacter on a first name field.\n\n230\n00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:48.810\nBeing able to do something like that\ninstead of actually going to another\n\n231\n00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:53.000\ncolumn and typing in username and\nthen going okay, Ronnie Wong, R Wong and\n\n232\n00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.450\nactually retyping everything.\n\n233\n00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:57.790\nI could see being able to extract,\nat least, out that first character and\n\n234\n00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:00.180\nthen maybe use the other one\nin combination at some point.\n\n235\n00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:00.820\n>> Absolutely.\n\n236\n00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:02.080\n>> I know we're gonna be doing that.\n\n237\n00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.370\nBut at the same time,\n\n238\n00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:06.720\nit's just one of those things\nthat you just don't think about.\n\n239\n00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:10.590\nIt is easier cuz we're used to typing but\nremember, use the power of Excel.\n\n240\n00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:13.450\nExcel built all these tools in there and\nthey are.\n\n241\n00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:15.940\nIf you will at least learn\njust a little bit of it,\n\n242\n00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:19.490\nyou'll actually be able to see how fast\nyou can really get by using Excel.\n\n243\n00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:21.790\n>> Absolutely, it's easy to do\nwhen you got 20, 25 employees.\n\n244\n00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:22.618\nWhen you've got 125, 1,000,\n\n245\n00:13:22.618 --> 00:13:27.730\n20,000 employees, you don't wanna\ncreate those usernames by hand.\n\n246\n00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:31.300\nAnd that's a great example,\nif we have time,\n\n247\n00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.790\nwe'll take a peek at that one as well.\n\n248\n00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:34.950\n>> All right, Mike so-\n>> So, MID [LAUGH]\n\n249\n00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:36.360\n>> Yeah, I was gonna say, all right Mike,\n\n250\n00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.845\nso tell us the benefit of MID.\n\n251\n00:13:37.845 --> 00:13:39.240\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, so MID's an interesting one.\n\n252\n00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.520\nMID is when you need to extract\ncharacters right out of the middle.\n\n253\n00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.790\nYou're not starting on the right,\n\n254\n00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:48.030\nyou're not starting on the left,\nyou want some in the middle of a field.\n\n255\n00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:51.910\nI was thinking about, I almost did\nan example with a GUID where maybe\n\n256\n00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:56.820\nthis four characters right\nhere represents a category.\n\n257\n00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:00.690\nAnd I wanna get that into its own\ncolumn so that I can sort by that or\n\n258\n00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:03.370\ngroup by that or total by that or\nsomething like that.\n\n259\n00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:06.140\nThat'd be an example of\nwhere I might wanna use MID.\n\n260\n00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:08.220\nAnother example would\nbe this phone number.\n\n261\n00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:11.310\nLet's say I want to group by area code.\n\n262\n00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:15.000\nWell I can't because area\ncode's in this field here\n\n263\n00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.600\namongst all the other text info.\n\n264\n00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:23.370\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use a\nMID function to extract the area code out.\n\n265\n00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:27.590\nSo it's simply saying whereas right and\nleft MID's the same thing,\n\n266\n00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:33.200\nyou start with mid, open parenthesis,\nwhat text do you wanna work with.\n\n267\n00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:39.000\nI'll select my field there, and now you\nhave to provide two bits of information,\n\n268\n00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.040\nwhereas right or left, if you type right,\nit knows it's starting from the rightmost\n\n269\n00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:46.050\npoint, and all you gotta do is tell\nit how many characters over to count.\n\n270\n00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:48.270\nIf you do left,\nit's starting from the leftmost point,\n\n271\n00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:51.380\nand you just have to tell it how many\ncharacters you want it to count over.\n\n272\n00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:55.050\nWIth MID, you're starting in the middle,\nbut not necessarily the exact midpoint,\n\n273\n00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:58.710\nit's wherever you want to start\nother than the right or the left.\n\n274\n00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:01.040\nSo now you gotta give it\ntwo bits of information.\n\n275\n00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.370\nWhere do you wanna start and\nthen how many characters do I want?\n\n276\n00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:07.190\nSo in my case,\nI just want the area code so\n\n277\n00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:11.410\nI need to move over one,\ntwo, three characters over.\n\n278\n00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:15.510\nSo I'm gonna start from character three,\nactually you know what,\n\n279\n00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:17.860\nthis is gonna be character\nfour if I'm not mistaken.\n\n280\n00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.620\nHave to double check on that.\n\n281\n00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:23.840\nI want that fourth character and\nI want three total characters.\n\n282\n00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:28.830\nHit my close parentheses and\nthere is my area code.\n\n283\n00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:32.020\nSo let's take a look at that again.\n\n284\n00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:36.366\nThe first one is A2 is the cell\nthat I'm pulling the data from,\n\n285\n00:15:36.366 --> 00:15:39.920\n4 is saying start at the fourth character.\n\n286\n00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:43.930\nSo there's a 1 and then a space,\nand then an open parentheses,\n\n287\n00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:45.280\nthat's characters 1, 2, and 3.\n\n288\n00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.610\nThe fourth character is that number 3,\nthat's where I wanna start.\n\n289\n00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:53.730\nAnd then starting there, count the next\nthree characters, so 3, the 6, and the 5.\n\n290\n00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:54.280\n>> All right, Mike,\n\n291\n00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:58.380\nwhen you actually showed us that little\ntool tip that actually popped up.\n\n292\n00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.050\nThere's a way we can see\na little bit more of that.\n\n293\n00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:03.738\nIf you hit that little FX button now\nthat you have that function in there,\n\n294\n00:16:03.738 --> 00:16:05.800\nthat should bring up this dialogue box.\n\n295\n00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.738\nThat allows you to take just a little bit\nmore time in making those decisions and\n\n296\n00:16:09.738 --> 00:16:14.130\nthe good thing about it is on the right\nhand side where you see the equals, right?\n\n297\n00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:17.835\nWhen you see stuff like that, when you see\nnumbers right there then you know that,\n\n298\n00:16:17.835 --> 00:16:19.410\nJosh, you're actually doing this right.\n\n299\n00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:22.500\nI know that there's a lot of times where\nyou end up, well where I end up I should\n\n300\n00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:26.950\nsay, see the word invalid, or you get\nquestions marks, then you know it's wrong.\n\n301\n00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:30.860\nBut here's another way that you just slow\ndown in the function of you're not really\n\n302\n00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:34.960\nsure about it and you go, I can't remember\nwhat its suppose to do, and this actually\n\n303\n00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.310\ngives you those questions a little bit\nmore than just that little tiny short tip.\n\n304\n00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:41.718\n>> That's a great point, in fact you can\nsee what the formula result is gonna be.\n\n305\n00:16:41.718 --> 00:16:45.252\nSo let's say I was unsure about,\ndo I start with the one I want or\n\n306\n00:16:45.252 --> 00:16:48.070\ndo I start with the one\nright before the one I want?\n\n307\n00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:51.592\nWell, if I would've chosen a three for\nthe starting point, and then,\n\n308\n00:16:51.592 --> 00:16:54.990\nthree characters,\nI would have got parenthesis three, six.\n\n309\n00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:55.700\nThat's not what I want.\n\n310\n00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.110\nI want three, six, five, right?\n\n311\n00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:02.220\nIf I've taken four characters, I'd get the\nopen parenthesis and then my area code.\n\n312\n00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:03.830\nSo, I know I've something wrong.\n\n313\n00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:05.280\nSo, I don't want that open parenthesis.\n\n314\n00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.650\nSo, I'm gonna start one\nmore character over.\n\n315\n00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:09.410\nAnd now, I've got two many characters.\n\n316\n00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:12.240\nSo we're gonna drop that\nback down to a three.\n\n317\n00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:16.210\nAnd I can see that's perfect, that's\nexactly what I want and I can click okay.\n\n318\n00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:20.100\nSo that's a great point that kinda\ngives you that feedback that you need\n\n319\n00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:22.250\nother than just hitting enter and\ngoing, smack.\n\n320\n00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:23.120\nThat's wrong.\n\n321\n00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.598\nWhatever the case may be.\n\n322\n00:17:24.598 --> 00:17:27.238\n>> Now Mike, before we move on from\nthere let me make one other point.\n\n323\n00:17:27.238 --> 00:17:30.118\nI know this is your show but, at the same\nI'd like to make one other point\n\n324\n00:17:30.118 --> 00:17:32.726\non that dialog box there we can\nclick back on it for a moment here.\n\n325\n00:17:32.726 --> 00:17:34.006\n>> Yep, absolutely.\n\n326\n00:17:34.006 --> 00:17:35.780\n>> Yeah, once we get that function up.\n\n327\n00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:39.530\nAnd zoom in,\nto the right of that white box there is,\n\n328\n00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:42.630\nthat is called that little\ncollapse dialogue box thing.\n\n329\n00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:43.330\n>> I call it the picker.\n\n330\n00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:44.438\n>> The picker?\nOkay, yeah.\n\n331\n00:17:44.438 --> 00:17:45.654\n>> I don't know if that's\nwhat it's really called.\n\n332\n00:17:45.654 --> 00:17:46.574\nI think it's the picker.\n\n333\n00:17:46.574 --> 00:17:48.323\n>> I think technically it's\ncalled the collapse dialogue box,\n\n334\n00:17:48.323 --> 00:17:49.310\nis what it's called.\n\n335\n00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:53.170\nBut you might be wondering, okay Ronnie,\nwhat's the big deal about this?\n\n336\n00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:54.800\nNotice how much of\nthe screen is picking up.\n\n337\n00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:58.210\nAnd if Mike were to start, if he had\ncovered some of the stuff, right?\n\n338\n00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:02.330\nHe could just actually click that and that\nactually collapses that entire dialogue\n\n339\n00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:05.880\nbox down and he can select what he wants,\nand that just fills that in for him.\n\n340\n00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.970\nIt allows us to be able to kind of\ngo like, is this really what I need?\n\n341\n00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:13.500\nAnd then you pop it in there, numbers\nstart appearing then you know, guess not.\n\n342\n00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.558\nYou can actually do it again and you know,\nbe able to pick what you need to.\n\n343\n00:18:16.558 --> 00:18:18.198\nSo either way, right?\n\n344\n00:18:18.198 --> 00:18:22.278\nSometimes it doesn't appear as big you\nknow like this, it's all expanded out.\n\n345\n00:18:22.278 --> 00:18:25.100\nBut when you collapse it down and you can\nactually see maybe even the data around\n\n346\n00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.126\nand verify that the numbers\nare what you need them to be.\n\n347\n00:18:27.126 --> 00:18:30.000\n>> Absolutely, because there's times that\nthis thing will be sitting right here and\n\n348\n00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.880\nthe cell I have to select\nis right behind it.\n\n349\n00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.290\nSo this collapses everything up.\n\n350\n00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:36.770\nI can pick the cell I want, and\nthen I can bring the dialogue back, and\n\n351\n00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:37.720\nI can keep on trucking.\n\n352\n00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.620\nSo very, very good point.\n\n353\n00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:42.210\nAll right, next thing I wanna look at,\nRonnie, is something called the trim\n\n354\n00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:45.100\nfunction, and I think I mentioned\nthis in an episode the other day.\n\n355\n00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:50.900\nThis allows me to get rid of all the extra\nwhat we would call white space or spaces.\n\n356\n00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:54.340\nIf you have information,\nwhat it does is it looks at a tech screen.\n\n357\n00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:59.770\nIt'll remove all spaces except for\na single space between words.\n\n358\n00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:00.410\nAll right?\n\n359\n00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:06.760\nSo if you had something like, the dog,\nand I'm gonna put two spaces in there,\n\n360\n00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:13.260\ndog, and I'll put a few spaces in there,\nwas, and lots of spaces.\n\n361\n00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.310\nBarking, all right?\n\n362\n00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:18.530\nSo the text, it's very spaced out, right?\n\n363\n00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:23.580\nI can write a formula, or the trim allows\nme to remove all the extra white space but\n\n364\n00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:26.220\nit will not put the words\nright up against each other.\n\n365\n00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:31.030\nThe formula is actually just trim,\nopen parentheses and\n\n366\n00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:32.370\nthen what cell you want to trim.\n\n367\n00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:37.220\nH10, close parenthesis,\nenter and there we go.\n\n368\n00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:40.310\nI now have, the dog was barking,\nwithout all the extra spaces but\n\n369\n00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:42.520\nthere is still one we\nspace between each word.\n\n370\n00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:45.720\nSo it doesn't like,\nmake one big run-on word out of it.\n\n371\n00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.028\nSo that's an example of what it does.\n\n372\n00:19:47.028 --> 00:19:48.548\nI think it makes it easier to visualize.\n\n373\n00:19:48.548 --> 00:19:52.008\nNow, where would I end up\nusing this in the real world?\n\n374\n00:19:52.008 --> 00:19:55.384\nI think we saw the other day,\nsometimes when you import data and\n\n375\n00:19:55.384 --> 00:19:58.632\nit was delimited, but\nyou don't specify the delimiter, or\n\n376\n00:19:58.632 --> 00:20:02.730\nthat there was two delimiters, you can\nend up with spaces at the beginning.\n\n377\n00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:04.810\nIf we look at these guys, like Daria,\n\n378\n00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:09.940\nthere's actually a space right\nbefore her name there, right?\n\n379\n00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:11.670\nThere's an extra character.\n\n380\n00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:14.660\nNow, I could just come up here and\nremove that.\n\n381\n00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:18.700\nBut if I've got 1,000 rows or 10,000\nrows to do that to, I'm not gonna sit\n\n382\n00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:21.750\nthere all day, my boss isn't gonna pay\nme to sit there all day to do that.\n\n383\n00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:23.700\nSo, is there a function we can use?\n\n384\n00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.200\nYes, the trim function will do just that.\n\n385\n00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:29.820\nWe could actually use, could we use left?\n\n386\n00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:32.210\nWe couldn't use left, we could use right.\n\n387\n00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:35.060\nBut the names are inconsistent in length,\nright?\n\n388\n00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:38.700\nSo if I tried to write an equals right,\nthis field.\n\n389\n00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:41.350\nTake off one, two, three,\nfour, five for Daria.\n\n390\n00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:43.030\nThat would work for her name.\n\n391\n00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:44.220\nBut what if I, and then let's try it.\n\n392\n00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:47.920\nLet's say equals right, open parentheses.\n\n393\n00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.440\nHere's my text.\n\n394\n00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:53.890\nJust take five characters from the right,\nclose parentheses.\n\n395\n00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:55.730\nPerfect, Daria looks great.\n\n396\n00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:58.700\nBut what about when we get down\nto some of these names like this?\n\n397\n00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:01.270\nNotice Yolanda becomes landa, right?\n\n398\n00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:04.790\nI needed more characters than that five.\n\n399\n00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:05.860\nSo it's not gonna work.\n\n400\n00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:09.900\nThe data is not consistent\nfrom the right side.\n\n401\n00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:10.990\nSo that won't work.\n\n402\n00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:13.280\nSo that's what we're gonna\nuse the trim function.\n\n403\n00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:20.110\nEquals trim, open parenthesis, select\nby field, close parenthesis, hit enter.\n\n404\n00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:22.790\nNow because this one doesn't\nspecify any particular length,\n\n405\n00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:25.210\nI can series fill or auto fill.\n\n406\n00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:26.970\nAnd now we're good to go.\n\n407\n00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:32.000\nAnother common use for this is when\nI'm importing stuff from databases.\n\n408\n00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.030\nA lot of times these databases, or\n\n409\n00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:37.570\nwhere we're getting our data\nfrom has a fixed field size.\n\n410\n00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:42.280\nLike when you enter your last name in\na form, it might say max characters is 25.\n\n411\n00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:45.230\nWhen that information\ngets put in the database,\n\n412\n00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:49.290\neven if your last name is Smith and\nit's only five characters long.\n\n413\n00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:51.228\nThe field still accept up to 25.\n\n414\n00:21:51.228 --> 00:21:53.728\nSo on a database, it's 25 characters long.\n\n415\n00:21:53.728 --> 00:21:56.608\nThere's five letters and\nthen the 20 blanks, right?\n\n416\n00:21:56.608 --> 00:21:59.274\nI go and\nimport that into a spreadsheet like this,\n\n417\n00:21:59.274 --> 00:22:01.316\nI can end up with something like this.\n\n418\n00:22:01.316 --> 00:22:03.461\nIt looks normal but if I zoom in,\n\n419\n00:22:03.461 --> 00:22:07.840\nyou'll notice there's a missing\ngrid line there, right?\n\n420\n00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:11.940\nAnd that's because there's actually\na whole bunch of space after it.\n\n421\n00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:15.610\nLook at all the blank spaces\nafter the name Rodrick, right?\n\n422\n00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:20.191\nSo another great use of trim,\nyou can do in a equals trim,\n\n423\n00:22:20.191 --> 00:22:26.050\nopen parenthesis, fill the trim,\nclose parenthesis, enter.\n\n424\n00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:30.858\nAnd now this does not\nhave any spaces after it.\n\n425\n00:22:30.858 --> 00:22:34.398\nAnd of course I could copy it and\ndo a little paste special.\n\n426\n00:22:37.658 --> 00:22:39.378\nMore space values there.\n\n427\n00:22:39.378 --> 00:22:43.489\nAnd now you can see with this one, there's\nno extra spaces behind it whereas this\n\n428\n00:22:43.489 --> 00:22:46.300\none, there's a whole lot\nof spaces behind it.\n\n429\n00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:49.210\nSo a trim allows me to get rid\nof those extra white spaces.\n\n430\n00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:51.455\n>> Now Mike, I was just thinking\nas you were showing that,\n\n431\n00:22:51.455 --> 00:22:56.040\nthat I can see this even useful even\nin things like regular word documents.\n\n432\n00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.720\nAnd you might be wondering why\nthe heck would this be useful?\n\n433\n00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:03.260\nWell let's say that you end up getting\na document that is fully justified, right?\n\n434\n00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:06.040\nAnd so, sometimes what happens\nbetween those words is\n\n435\n00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:09.750\nextra characters get put in there,\nbut now you don't want that.\n\n436\n00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:13.290\nWell, I know that I can go in there and\njust put the cursor right there and\n\n437\n00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:14.910\nbackspace and do all that.\n\n438\n00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:18.634\nBut I can also see just bringing up Excel,\nputting all that into a cell and then\n\n439\n00:23:18.634 --> 00:23:22.668\nusing the trim functions and say, hey,\nlet's just remove on it, copy it back in.\n\n440\n00:23:22.668 --> 00:23:23.916\n>> Put it back in and you are good to go.\n\n441\n00:23:23.916 --> 00:23:25.480\n>> So yeah, I was just thinking\nabout that and I was like, man,\n\n442\n00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:26.196\nthat's some great usage.\n\n443\n00:23:26.196 --> 00:23:28.096\n>> That's there.\n\n444\n00:23:28.096 --> 00:23:29.776\n>> No doubt.\n\n445\n00:23:29.776 --> 00:23:33.785\n>> All right, next thing I wanna talk\nabout is the upper and lower functions,\n\n446\n00:23:33.785 --> 00:23:35.516\nand these can be very handy too.\n\n447\n00:23:35.516 --> 00:23:38.190\nIt really helped me make\nmy data consistent.\n\n448\n00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:41.950\nI always find issues with state\nabbreviations, for example.\n\n449\n00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:44.400\nSome people put little F,\nlittle L for Florida.\n\n450\n00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:48.010\nSome people put a capital F, a little L,\nsome people capitalize both.\n\n451\n00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:51.581\nAnd if I look at my data or if I print\nout a report, it's very inconsistent,\n\n452\n00:23:51.581 --> 00:23:55.555\nit doesn't look good, it doesn't look\nprofessional because it's not, again,\n\n453\n00:23:55.555 --> 00:23:57.110\nconsistent to reuse that word.\n\n454\n00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:58.410\nSo, can I fix that?\n\n455\n00:23:58.410 --> 00:23:59.570\nAbsolutely.\n\n456\n00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:03.080\nUpper is gonna convert\neverything to upper case.\n\n457\n00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:05.470\nLower converts everything to lowercase.\n\n458\n00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:06.780\nPretty straightforward, right?\n\n459\n00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.340\nSo we're just gonna come over here.\n\n460\n00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:13.150\nFor example, I've got Gnv,\nthis is like an employee number.\n\n461\n00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:16.760\nGnv for their location and\nthen their particular unique number.\n\n462\n00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.540\nSome people have entered\nit in all lowercase.\n\n463\n00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:20.180\nSome people use proper case.\n\n464\n00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:21.970\nSome people all uppercase.\n\n465\n00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:24.550\nAnd, really,\nit just needs to be all uppercase.\n\n466\n00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:29.016\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nwrite my formula equals upper,\n\n467\n00:24:29.016 --> 00:24:34.850\nopen parenthesis, choose your field,\nclose parenthesis, hit Enter.\n\n468\n00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:36.780\nAnd now it's all uppercase, and\n\n469\n00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:40.870\nI can just do a series fill on that,\nand we should be good to go.\n\n470\n00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:41.850\nSame thing with lower.\n\n471\n00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:46.010\nI can do =lower, open parenthesis,\n\n472\n00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:50.690\nchoose my field, close parenthesis,\nhit Enter, and now it's all lowercase.\n\n473\n00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:53.110\nI could do a series fill,\nand fix all those.\n\n474\n00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:54.720\nSo very easy to do.\n\n475\n00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:59.110\nYou're seeing things like Trim, Upper,\nLower, there's really not a lot to do.\n\n476\n00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:04.050\nYou type =, the word, open parentheses,\nchoose your cell, close parentheses,\n\n477\n00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:04.730\nand hit Enter, right?\n\n478\n00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:05.980\nIt's not complex,\n\n479\n00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:10.290\nit's just knowing that the function's\navailable is the main thing there.\n\n480\n00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:13.220\n>> There's no doubt that using this\nalso helps you when you do have the data\n\n481\n00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.340\ninconsistencies that Mike's talked about.\n\n482\n00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:17.300\nRemember that a lot of times\nwhen you're working with data,\n\n483\n00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.390\nit's not just data that you've entered in.\n\n484\n00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:23.100\nIf it were only you you'd probably\nkept it consistent throughout time.\n\n485\n00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:25.710\nBut the very fact is that other\npeople have done data entry.\n\n486\n00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:27.170\nIt is gonna be inconsistent.\n\n487\n00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:30.760\nAnd using these functions like the upper\ncase, or the upper, excuse me,\n\n488\n00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:34.380\nnot upper case, upper and\nlower functions, the left,\n\n489\n00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:39.200\nright, mid, all these are really gonna\nhelp you make a very consistent data set.\n\n490\n00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.030\nAnd that makes it easier\nwhen you start searching for\n\n491\n00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:43.370\ninformation inside of your spreadsheets,\ntoo.\n\n492\n00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:46.880\n>> Absolutely, all right, last one\nI wanna do is called concatenation.\n\n493\n00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:51.100\nAnd concatenation is just a fancy word for\ngluing strings together.\n\n494\n00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:52.430\nThat's the way I like to think of it.\n\n495\n00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:53.720\nTaking two strings, and\n\n496\n00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:56.380\ngluing them together, or\nmaking one string out of them.\n\n497\n00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:59.380\nOr taking a dozen strings, right,\nand gluing them together and\n\n498\n00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:01.310\nmaking one string out of it.\n\n499\n00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:02.830\nSo I've got an example\nhere that we can do.\n\n500\n00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:06.291\nI've got FirstName,\nLastName in two separate columns,\n\n501\n00:26:06.291 --> 00:26:09.020\nwhich is normally how we want our data.\n\n502\n00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:11.710\nBut if I'm gonna make a phone list,\nor a report or\n\n503\n00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:15.450\nsomething like that, I might want these\nformatted a little bit differently.\n\n504\n00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:18.660\nI might want them looking\nmore like a name, right?\n\n505\n00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:23.150\nAnd normally we don't have all this\nextra space between our names, so\n\n506\n00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:25.560\nI wanna plug those strings back together.\n\n507\n00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:29.550\nOr like Ronnie said, maybe I wanna do\na username with first initial from\n\n508\n00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:31.720\nthe first name and then last name, right?\n\n509\n00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:32.820\nI could plug those together.\n\n510\n00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:34.130\nWe'll try that one as well.\n\n511\n00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:37.090\nSo, the first thing I'm gonna do\nis just straight concatenation.\n\n512\n00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:42.930\nIt's simply equals and\nthen concatenate, open parenthesis.\n\n513\n00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:44.670\nWhat string do you wanna glue together?\n\n514\n00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:48.070\nI wanna take this one and\nI wanna put a comma.\n\n515\n00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:50.240\nWhat's the next string\nyou wanna glue together?\n\n516\n00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.680\nWell, I want this one.\n\n517\n00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:54.940\nI'm gonna close my parentheses,\nand I'm gonna hit Enter.\n\n518\n00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:57.630\nAnd sure enough,\nit glues those strings together, but\n\n519\n00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:00.420\nyou might notice something\na little bit odd about that.\n\n520\n00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:04.140\n>> Yeah, I think we're missing at least a\nspace in between the first and last name.\n\n521\n00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:05.550\n>> Yeah, normally we would expect that.\n\n522\n00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:06.750\nWe want a little bit of a break.\n\n523\n00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:08.410\nThat shouldn't be one word.\n\n524\n00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:09.740\nWell, Excel doesn't know that.\n\n525\n00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:14.460\nIt's taken A2 and the value in B2 and\nit's plugging them together and\n\n526\n00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:18.280\nthat's what we get, so we gotta let it\nknow that there's something else to it.\n\n527\n00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:22.350\nSo I'm gonna go back to my formula and\nI said concatenate A2 and B2.\n\n528\n00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:25.090\nI'm just gonna slip in here.\n\n529\n00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:26.370\nI'm gonna put another value.\n\n530\n00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:27.778\nIn fact, let's just,\njust to make it easier,\n\n531\n00:27:27.778 --> 00:27:29.270\nI'm gonna delete what's on the end.\n\n532\n00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:33.100\nSo I'm gonna take the first cell but\nthen I need to put a space.\n\n533\n00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:37.433\nSo, my text two is not gonna\nbe a field for my spreadsheet,\n\n534\n00:27:37.433 --> 00:27:41.332\nit's just gonna be a quote space quote,\nall right?\n\n535\n00:27:41.332 --> 00:27:43.512\nSo, I'm gonna say put a space in there,\n\n536\n00:27:43.512 --> 00:27:46.890\nanything between the quotes\nis just a static string.\n\n537\n00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:48.550\nI'll put in my comma.\n\n538\n00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:50.390\nThen I'll grab his last name.\n\n539\n00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:52.780\nI'll end that parentheses,\nand I'll hit Enter.\n\n540\n00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:54.050\nAnd that looks a little better.\n\n541\n00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:55.050\n>> Much better.\n\n542\n00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:56.050\n>> What if I wanted to reverse it?\n\n543\n00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:58.150\nWhat if I wanted LastName FirstName?\n\n544\n00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:00.570\nNormally, with a LastName FirstName,\nlike in a phone list, so\n\n545\n00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:04.650\nI can sort by last name, there's\na comma after the last name, right?\n\n546\n00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:07.266\nIt'd be Lopez, Ilana.\n\n547\n00:28:07.266 --> 00:28:10.040\nSo, I'm going to change my\nformula just a little bit.\n\n548\n00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:12.680\nConcatenate, all right.\n\n549\n00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:17.990\nOpen parentheses, take their last name,\nand then a comma.\n\n550\n00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:25.470\nText two is, instead of just a space,\nit's gonna be quote, comma, space, quote.\n\n551\n00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:28.490\nYou see between the quotes\nI've got a comma and a space.\n\n552\n00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:32.000\nAnd then a comma to tell that I'm\nmoving on to text field three.\n\n553\n00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.780\nAnd that's going to be their first name.\n\n554\n00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:37.986\nEnd my parentheses and we're good to go.\n\n555\n00:28:37.986 --> 00:28:42.421\nAll right so now I have Lopez, Ilana if\nI'm saying her name correctly, hopefully,\n\n556\n00:28:42.421 --> 00:28:44.420\notherwise she'll get mad at me.\n\n557\n00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:47.000\nSo lots of cool things I\ncan do with concatenation.\n\n558\n00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:47.540\n>> There's no doubt.\n\n559\n00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:51.020\nNow Mike, can we do that,\ncan we actually take the, in other words,\n\n560\n00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:52.770\ncombine those functions together?\n\n561\n00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:55.610\nYou take the first letter\nof their first name and\n\n562\n00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:58.480\nthen you also concatenate it with\nthe last name, making the username.\n\n563\n00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:59.142\n>> Absolutely.\n\n564\n00:28:59.142 --> 00:29:01.220\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] We're going to\n\n565\n00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:03.770\ntry it anyway, right?\n\n566\n00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:04.440\nAll right, here we go.\n\n567\n00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:06.410\nSo we're going to make my\nfield a little bit wider.\n\n568\n00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:09.410\nAnd it's really much easier\nthan I make it sound.\n\n569\n00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:13.130\nWe're gonna just have to think about\nthe logic, that's all you have to do.\n\n570\n00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:18.810\nI'll zoom back in here, and to make\ntheir user name you want first initial,\n\n571\n00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:22.570\nlast name, @ and\nthen what's our company, ITpro.tv?\n\n572\n00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:23.530\n>> Sure, that works.\n\n573\n00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:24.830\n>> Something like that, all right.\n\n574\n00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:27.450\nSo let do, we're gonna say equals.\n\n575\n00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:29.400\nAnd we're gonna just first have to,\ntheir first name and\n\n576\n00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.640\ntheir last name are in separate fields so\nwe're gonna have to glue them together,\n\n577\n00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:36.540\nher first name I only want\nthe first letter from, all right?\n\n578\n00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:39.820\nSo we're gonna concatenate, right?\n\n579\n00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:41.960\nAnd you can really work at this\nproblem in different ways.\n\n580\n00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.950\nSome people like to work\nfrom the middle out.\n\n581\n00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:46.390\nI kind of like to start\nfrom the beginning and\n\n582\n00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:49.840\nmy logic is a little bit different\nthan most, but who cares, right?\n\n583\n00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:54.970\nSo I'm gonna concatenate, and normally\nI would go pick her first name, right?\n\n584\n00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:57.970\nSo I say all right I'm gonna\ntake this field right here, but\n\n585\n00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:00.230\nI don't want that entire field.\n\n586\n00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:05.125\nSo I'm gonna slip in here\na little formula that\n\n587\n00:30:05.125 --> 00:30:09.907\nsays left, open parenthesis, what field?\n\n588\n00:30:09.907 --> 00:30:11.790\nA-2.\n\n589\n00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:13.650\nHow many characters do I want?\n\n590\n00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:14.690\nOne.\n\n591\n00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:16.270\nClose my parenthesis.\n\n592\n00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:16.900\nRight, so\n\n593\n00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:22.530\nnow if you think in your head this part\nof it all by itself, what is that?\n\n594\n00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:25.740\nThe first character of her first name,\nright?\n\n595\n00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:27.980\nSo you could substitute\njust saying the letter d,\n\n596\n00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.300\nthat's the way you got to think about it.\n\n597\n00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:31.690\nThere is one part of the puzzle solved.\n\n598\n00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:34.450\nSo now that I've got her first\nletter of her first name,\n\n599\n00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:40.270\nI want to glue that together with\nher last name so comma, last name.\n\n600\n00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:42.580\nNo spaces in her user name or\nemail address, right?\n\n601\n00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:46.310\nSo it's first letter,\ncomma, last name, comma,\n\n602\n00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:49.500\nand then the last part is text\nthat's always gonna be the same.\n\n603\n00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:50.850\nIt's static text.\n\n604\n00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:57.080\nSo it's gonna be quote, @itpro.tv.\n\n605\n00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:01.240\nEnd my quote to end the string,\nend my parentheses.\n\n606\n00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:06.804\nHit Enter, keep your fingers crossed,\nand there you've got DRodgers@itpro.\n\n607\n00:31:06.804 --> 00:31:10.021\nNow D and R are capitalized because\nthe fields we took it from were\n\n608\n00:31:10.021 --> 00:31:10.981\ncapital, right.\n\n609\n00:31:10.981 --> 00:31:14.080\nI want it all lowercase,\nthat's the way most of my emails are.\n\n610\n00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:17.370\nLet's just slip in here,\nI'm gonna take the whole answer, right?\n\n611\n00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:20.480\nThis whole thing provides that name.\n\n612\n00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:25.310\nTake that whole thing and\njust put it inside a lower function.\n\n613\n00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:29.920\nOpen parentheses,\nclose parentheses, Enter.\n\n614\n00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:32.740\nAnd now I've got drodgers@itpro.tv,\nall lowercase.\n\n615\n00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:36.100\nSo, again, think of it using these\nformulas, combining them up.\n\n616\n00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:38.810\nIt's not too bad once you\nstart to just think about\n\n617\n00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:40.390\nthe logic that you need to get through.\n\n618\n00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:43.700\n>> There's no doubt that the use of\nthese of text formulas can really help\n\n619\n00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:48.420\nyou to make a new field, what we call\na calculated field, appear exactly\n\n620\n00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:52.730\nthe way that we want it instead of having\nto manually type out all that information.\n\n621\n00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:56.826\nI could not stand to type in everybody's\nemail address, or even a username.\n\n622\n00:31:56.826 --> 00:32:00.020\nIf they're saying, here's the list here,\nyou just have to create the username and\n\n623\n00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:02.185\nemail address,\nI'd rather create it one time.\n\n624\n00:32:02.185 --> 00:32:02.700\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n625\n00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:05.450\n>> And then use that field,\nlet it do the rest.\n\n626\n00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:07.700\n>> Yeah, here's another thing you\nmight not have thought about.\n\n627\n00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:09.290\nLet's look at my spreadsheet again.\n\n628\n00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:12.060\nBecause it's a formula,\nit's dynamic, right?\n\n629\n00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:13.920\nLet's say Daria gets married.\n\n630\n00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:17.040\nMe and Daria, we got this little thing,\nand we're finally telling everybody in\n\n631\n00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:19.080\nthe company, we're going,\nwe got married, all right?\n\n632\n00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:20.109\nI'm gonna change her last name.\n\n633\n00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:24.080\nLook at that.\n\n634\n00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:26.140\nHer email address changed, right?\n\n635\n00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:27.680\nBecause it's a formula that's dynamic.\n\n636\n00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.190\nThe source data changes.\n\n637\n00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:30.000\nIt keeps it up to date.\n\n638\n00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.210\nSo something else to think about.\n\n639\n00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:34.910\n>> There's no doubt that the dynamic\nnature of what we're actually doing here\n\n640\n00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:36.620\nreally does help speed up the process and\n\n641\n00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:39.600\na lot of things we can be\ndoing inside of Excel.\n\n642\n00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:40.830\nFormatting the actual data,\n\n643\n00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:44.190\ngetting it actually appearing the way\nthat we want is really helpful.\n\n644\n00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:45.330\nRemember when we do searches,\n\n645\n00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:48.380\nit really does help us out to be\nable to do stuff like that too.\n\n646\n00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:52.390\nAlso, when we start presenting the data\nin things like reports, it's gonna help.\n\n647\n00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:56.540\nAll of these little functions that Mike\nshowed us today are really going to allow\n\n648\n00:32:56.540 --> 00:33:00.630\nus to take regular data that's\nactually in a string field, and\n\n649\n00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:02.980\ndo all those things that\nhe actually showed you.\n\n650\n00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:04.890\nAnd then you'll actually\nsave a lot more time.\n\n651\n00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:08.150\nWell thank you Mike again for\nshowing us those different functions.\n\n652\n00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:10.280\nThank you for joining us today.\n\n653\n00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:12.780\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n654\n00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:13.620\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n655\n00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:14.738\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n656\n00:33:14.738 --> 00:33:22.210\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.380\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.990\ntoday we're gonna be taking\na look at Microsoft Excel 2016.\n\n5\n00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.870\nWe're specifically going to be getting\ninto the area of actually inserting charts\n\n6\n00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.800\ninto our Excel workbooks.\n\n7\n00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.770\nBut we wanna make sure that\nwe understand something,\n\n8\n00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.490\nthat a lot of times the data that\nwe have in front of us is so\n\n9\n00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.840\nmuch data that what would be\neasier is to present it visually.\n\n10\n00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.810\nAnd so we've got our expect right here,\nMr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:39.750\nHow's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.830\n>> It's going great, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.610\nI'm glad to be here, and\nyou really nailed it on the head there.\n\n14\n00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.620\nCharts are something that we can\nadd into our spreadsheets to help\n\n15\n00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.930\nrepresent that data graphically, right?\n\n16\n00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.280\nWhen we look at these\nspreadsheets full of numbers,\n\n17\n00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.570\nsometimes we talk about it in previous\nepisodes where we looked at sparklines and\n\n18\n00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.430\nconditional formatting and\nthings like that.\n\n19\n00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.400\nWhat did we say?\n\n20\n00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.880\nWhy do we wanna do that?\n\n21\n00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.840\nWell, to help draw our attention to\ncertain values that are out of the normal\n\n22\n00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.580\nrange of values, the highest of the month\nor that really low point of the month or\n\n23\n00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.450\nan unusual sales month, or to spot trends.\n\n24\n00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.730\nA lot of times it's hard to see those\nthings just looking at the raw data,\n\n25\n00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.460\nlooking at the numbers,\nbecause we just lose focus.\n\n26\n00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.180\nIt's just a bunch of numbers\nthat start blurring together.\n\n27\n00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.710\nYou put that in a chart.\n\n28\n00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.200\nYou draw a little line and\nit's going along like this.\n\n29\n00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.830\nThen it jumps up and then comes back down.\n\n30\n00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.200\nThat sticks out.\n\n31\n00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.050\nYou see that immediately.\n\n32\n00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.810\nIf you've got a sheet full of numbers and\n\n33\n00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.430\nthree of them are red out of the thousand\nnumbers, those jump out at you.\n\n34\n00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.830\nSo a lot of times, we like to add\na visual element to our spreadsheets\n\n35\n00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.770\nto draw attention to certain numbers or\nto spot trends or anomalies in our data.\n\n36\n00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.940\nAnd that's exactly what\nwe're gonna do here.\n\n37\n00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.900\n>> Now, Mike, when we take a look\nat the idea of charting data,\n\n38\n00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.320\nI remember trying to do this during\nthe days when I was in grade school and,\n\n39\n00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.850\nI wanna make a chart that\nlooks like this and like this.\n\n40\n00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.217\nIt was very easy for me to get confused on\nwhat would go on that vertical line versus\n\n41\n00:02:06.217 --> 00:02:08.286\nwhat would go on the horizontal line.\n\n42\n00:02:08.286 --> 00:02:11.611\nTrying to figure out where the data\nactually went was a little bit confusing\n\n43\n00:02:11.611 --> 00:02:12.624\nfor me [SOUND] at times.\n\n44\n00:02:12.624 --> 00:02:16.667\nAnd so when we start seeing stuff like\nthat, right, what we have to remember,\n\n45\n00:02:16.667 --> 00:02:20.466\nthough, is that inside of Excel there\nis actually a lot of tools for us that\n\n46\n00:02:20.466 --> 00:02:24.263\nmake it a lot easier, but it really\ndoes help us to make a very professional\n\n47\n00:02:24.263 --> 00:02:28.100\nlooking chart and that's really\nimportant when we need to present that.\n\n48\n00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.150\n>> Absolutely Ronnie.\n\n49\n00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.370\nI'm a little bit older than grade school\nand I still have trouble figuring out\n\n50\n00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.460\nsometimes which goes where when you're\nmaking these charts, but as you said,\n\n51\n00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.320\nExcel has wizards.\n\n52\n00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.370\nExcel has ways of helping us\nout creating those charts.\n\n53\n00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.450\nMakes it pretty easy to work with.\n\n54\n00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.050\nAnd it's easy to flop things around.\n\n55\n00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.550\nRight?\n\n56\n00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.500\nIf you make a chart and it looks silly or\n\n57\n00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.240\nit doesn't seem to represent your data or\nit's not doing what you want it to do,\n\n58\n00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.220\nyou can easily move things around\nto get it to where you need to be.\n\n59\n00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.740\nIt just takes a little bit of practice,\nI will say that.\n\n60\n00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.830\nEven myself, I don't do charts a lot and\nsometimes I'll get a little lost in\n\n61\n00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.070\nthere trying to think is this\nthe horizontal, the vertical?\n\n62\n00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.310\nBut with Excel, like I said,\nit's pretty intuitive.\n\n63\n00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.110\nTry a few different things and\nyou can usually get it worked out.\n\n64\n00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.630\nTalk about good looking charts.\n\n65\n00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.770\nThese charts will look professional.\n\n66\n00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:24.480\nIt's a great way to add that,\nI don't want to say class, but\n\n67\n00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.450\nit really does class up your spreadsheet\nwhen you start throwing charts in there.\n\n68\n00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.770\nI remember spending lots\nof time formatting charts,\n\n69\n00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.360\ntrying to set the colors of the data\npoints themselves or the bars and\n\n70\n00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.880\nthe plot lines and the plot area and the\nbackground and the titles and all this.\n\n71\n00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.970\nExcel has styles.\n\n72\n00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.170\nWe've seen styles before that\nwe've applied to tables.\n\n73\n00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.000\nSame thing is gonna work in here for\ncharts.\n\n74\n00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.304\nSo you can still spend hours doing\nthat formatting if you want, but\n\n75\n00:03:49.304 --> 00:03:52.136\nif you need a quick and\ndirty chart, and when I say dirty,\n\n76\n00:03:52.136 --> 00:03:56.330\nI really shouldn't say that, a really good\nlooking chart, Excel can do it for you.\n\n77\n00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.367\n>> Mike, when we start to\ntake a look at charting data,\n\n78\n00:03:59.367 --> 00:04:03.372\nwe've got to realize what the purpose\nof it is and that's when we'll\n\n79\n00:04:03.372 --> 00:04:06.962\nactually be able to decide what\nneeds to be in that vertical and\n\n80\n00:04:06.962 --> 00:04:11.200\nwhat needs to be in that horizontal and\nthat really comes down to the key.\n\n81\n00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.400\nBut the good thing is Excel\ncan really help us there.\n\n82\n00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.480\nI want to make a point\nabout this one thing.\n\n83\n00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.250\nCharts really are the things\nthat most people want to see.\n\n84\n00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.450\nThey don't want to see\nthe thousands rows of data,\n\n85\n00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.150\nthey don't want to see the 55 columns\nof data, they wanna see a chart.\n\n86\n00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.510\nAnd the reason why is that they normally\nneed to make some type of business\n\n87\n00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.460\ndecision based off of the data\nthat they're presented.\n\n88\n00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.940\nAnd if you can actually make a chart that\nwill show them exactly what they need,\n\n89\n00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.640\nthey appreciate it more than them having\nto spend time saying, all right, so\n\n90\n00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.500\nI see all these numbers.\n\n91\n00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.710\nHow does that really?\n\n92\n00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.650\nOr what does that really\nrepresent in my company?\n\n93\n00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.050\nAnd so, even though it's an easy\nway that we can do things.\n\n94\n00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.165\nWhat we want to do is,\nafter we actually create one and\n\n95\n00:04:48.165 --> 00:04:50.236\nMike's about to show us how\neasy it is to create one.\n\n96\n00:04:50.236 --> 00:04:52.346\nWe just need to verify that\nit's actually reporting what,\n\n97\n00:04:52.346 --> 00:04:53.834\nexactly what we thought it would report.\n\n98\n00:04:53.834 --> 00:04:54.474\n>> Absolutely.\n\n99\n00:04:54.474 --> 00:05:00.005\nAnd another little hint will be,\ndon't try to chart tons of data, right?\n\n100\n00:05:00.005 --> 00:05:00.600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n101\n00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.000\nI'm gonna show you an example\nhere in just a second.\n\n102\n00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.590\nWhen we create our charts, they're\nusually built off of summaries, right?\n\n103\n00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.956\nYou have a list of sales people and\nyou have all their sales for a quarter,\n\n104\n00:05:11.956 --> 00:05:14.800\nor a period, or a month or whatever it is.\n\n105\n00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.160\nAnd then at the bottom of that we\ntypically have a totals row or\n\n106\n00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.220\nan average or\nhowever we wanna summarize that data.\n\n107\n00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.310\nThat's what we wanna chart.\n\n108\n00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.690\nIf you try to chart each and every sale\nand things like that, you'll end up with\n\n109\n00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.990\na chart that's so busy that it's just\nas bad as looking at the raw data.\n\n110\n00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.360\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n111\n00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.260\nYou have to play around with\nyour numbers a little bit or\n\n112\n00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.970\nnot play around with your numbers but\nyou really have to think about what it\n\n113\n00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.060\nis that you're trying to represent and\nit's usually not individual data points.\n\n114\n00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.700\nIt's usually summary information\nthat we're going to try to do.\n\n115\n00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.320\nAll right.\n\n116\n00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.575\nSo, let's first start by\nmaking a simple chart.\n\n117\n00:05:47.575 --> 00:05:52.060\nI\"ve some data here and what I\"ve got\nin this workbook are several sheets.\n\n118\n00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.690\nWe've seen these throughout out episodes\nwhere I've a quarter's worth of sales,\n\n119\n00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.080\nall right, January through June here.\n\n120\n00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.420\nAnd, these are the actual sales where\non the 21st of January this hospital\n\n121\n00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:08.560\npurchased this product this many of them\nat this amount, so on and so forth, right?\n\n122\n00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.080\nWell I'm not charting this information\nper se, the individual sales.\n\n123\n00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.900\nI'll show you what'll happen if you\ntry to do that in just a little bit.\n\n124\n00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.550\nOff to the side I have some summary\ninformation for this month.\n\n125\n00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.580\nAnd then I have each month has\nits own little summary info.\n\n126\n00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.100\nAnd then on the Summary tab,\nI'm actually pulling the numbers from\n\n127\n00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.240\neach one of those summaries back\nonto this one spreadsheet here.\n\n128\n00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.620\nSo this is January for\nthe Florida Hospital.\n\n129\n00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.650\nThis is coming from the February sheet.\n\n130\n00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.860\nYou can see I'm just pulling\nthe values straight from\n\n131\n00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.790\nthose other worksheets, right?\n\n132\n00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.680\nAnd the reason I'm doing that is\nsometimes my boss doesn't want to see\n\n133\n00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.800\nall the numbers she just wants\nto see the summary information.\n\n134\n00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.650\nAnd to make it easier to create\nsome charts to give me that\n\n135\n00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:52.732\nvisual representation.\n\n136\n00:06:52.732 --> 00:06:57.330\nSo, when you make a chart, a couple of\nways you can start out making the chart.\n\n137\n00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.520\nYou can just select somewhere\nin the middle of the data, and\n\n138\n00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.230\nyou could actually start\ninserting a chart.\n\n139\n00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.800\nI will tell you that it's\nusually better if you can select\n\n140\n00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.440\neverything that you want\nto try to chart out.\n\n141\n00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.830\nAnd I'll show you what I mean.\n\n142\n00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.306\nWhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\ngrab all of this information.\n\n143\n00:07:13.306 --> 00:07:14.006\nRight?\n\n144\n00:07:14.006 --> 00:07:19.120\nNow, you'll notice I get a little\ntooltip that pops up over here.\n\n145\n00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.100\nAnd when I hover over it,\nI get this flyout menu.\n\n146\n00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.530\nAnd Ronnie, I'm gonna jump around\non our list of topics here.\n\n147\n00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:28.290\nThis is what they call the quick analyzer.\n\n148\n00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:31.720\nIt used to be that we had to think\nabout making these charts and\n\n149\n00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.560\ndecide how we want to do it.\n\n150\n00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:38.220\nExcel will now, once you select the data\nit's looking at the data for you.\n\n151\n00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.940\nAnd it's making some decisions.\n\n152\n00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:40.550\nAnd it's gonna say,\n\n153\n00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.650\nyou know what this type of data would\nbe best represented by this chart.\n\n154\n00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.900\nThere are several different types\nof charts that we can create.\n\n155\n00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.087\nAnd depending on what your data is\nsome charts are better than others at\n\n156\n00:07:51.087 --> 00:07:52.554\ndisplaying that data, right?\n\n157\n00:07:52.554 --> 00:07:59.136\nLike line charts, bar charts,\nscatter plots, pie charts, donuts.\n\n158\n00:07:59.136 --> 00:08:03.623\nThere's several different kinds but\nsome of them require two data points,\n\n159\n00:08:03.623 --> 00:08:06.130\nsome of them require three data points.\n\n160\n00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:09.390\nSo depending on what your data is,\nExcel can guide you in a right way.\n\n161\n00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:11.480\nSo all I'm gonna do is\ngo down here to charts.\n\n162\n00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:14.480\nAnd then you can see my different choices,\nand\n\n163\n00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.760\nI even get a preview as I\nhover over the different ones.\n\n164\n00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:22.930\nSo I can choose which one I\nthink I'm gonna like the most.\n\n165\n00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:27.020\nAnd we're gonna go with a bar chart for\nthis one here, this clustered bar.\n\n166\n00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:30.330\nSo I'll go ahead and\nselect it, and there we go.\n\n167\n00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:31.600\nIt was that easy.\n\n168\n00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.350\nI've got a chart.\n\n169\n00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:33.110\nNow it's not perfect.\n\n170\n00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:37.970\nThere are some things I can do to fine\ntune it, but I'm off to the races, right?\n\n171\n00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:40.370\nI've got a good start here, right?\n\n172\n00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:45.840\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and just undo that\nreal quick, and I'm gonna zoom back out.\n\n173\n00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:50.960\nIf I don't wanna use this quick analyzer,\nI'll select my data again.\n\n174\n00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.890\nAnd I can come up to the Insert ribbon,\nand then I have recommended charts which\n\n175\n00:08:55.890 --> 00:09:00.330\nis almost the same thing as\nthe de-analyzer, the quick analyzer.\n\n176\n00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.220\nYou click recommended charts, and\n\n177\n00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.160\nit's gonna say this is the chart\nI think works best for your data.\n\n178\n00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.030\nAnd you you can see there's a few\ndifferent ones that it's recommending.\n\n179\n00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:12.210\nThese are the same ones i was seeing\nwhen I did the quick analyzer and\n\n180\n00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:15.460\nI was hovering over those different\noptions, but I don't have to.\n\n181\n00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.930\nIf i say, you know what, Excel,\nI don't like your choice.\n\n182\n00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:19.940\nI would rather do something else.\n\n183\n00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:25.530\nYou can go to All Charts, and you can pick\nfrom several different types of charts.\n\n184\n00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:30.610\nAgain, mine really only has two what\nI would call data points, right?\n\n185\n00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:35.010\nI've got the month that the sales\nwere occurring in and the amount for\n\n186\n00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:36.530\neach one of those hospitals.\n\n187\n00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:40.660\nSo things like scatter charts\nare not gonna work as well for this.\n\n188\n00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.020\nSome of these types\nare just not going to work.\n\n189\n00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:49.210\nPie charts might work if I limit it to one\nmonth, but if I go with all six months\n\n190\n00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:53.430\nin all five hospitals, the pie charts\nreally not going to make a lot of sense.\n\n191\n00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:56.170\nIt's going to look good,\nlike colorful pieces of pie, but\n\n192\n00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:59.660\nit's not going to represent my data very\nwell or give me much advantage there.\n\n193\n00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:03.900\nColumn chart for\nthis type of data is probably the best, so\n\n194\n00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.530\nI'm going to go with that column\nchart there and I'm gonna click OK.\n\n195\n00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:10.690\nAnd you see it's really the same\nthing that that quick analyzer\n\n196\n00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:11.530\nended up deciding.\n\n197\n00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:14.430\nSo it does do a pretty good job,\nall right?\n\n198\n00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:16.420\nAnd that's it.\n\n199\n00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:19.810\nThat's a quick and\neasy chart that I can make.\n\n200\n00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:22.680\nNow, let's do another one.\n\n201\n00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.880\nLet me undo this guy.\n\n202\n00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:29.070\nAnd this time I'm gonna\nselect just one hospital,\n\n203\n00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:34.500\nall right, and\nI'm going to go back to my insert.\n\n204\n00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.920\nAnd I could do recommended,\nright, like I just showed you.\n\n205\n00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.210\nWe could do the quick analyzer.\n\n206\n00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:39.930\nThat tool tip was down there.\n\n207\n00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:41.980\nOr I do have the individual chart types.\n\n208\n00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:45.850\nIf I know exactly what type of chart\nI want, I can come right over here.\n\n209\n00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:49.560\nI can hit this little drop down list,\nnext to, [COUGH] in this case,\n\n210\n00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:53.190\nmy bar charts, and\nI can select the one I want.\n\n211\n00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:54.830\nThere's a histogram.\n\n212\n00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:57.170\nLet's do the cluster.\n\n213\n00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:58.070\nNo, let's do a line chart.\n\n214\n00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:59.850\nWe'll do that one, right?\n\n215\n00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:01.890\nAnd I'll do a 2-D line for that.\n\n216\n00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:05.960\nAnd you think, wow,\nthat doesn't look all that good.\n\n217\n00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.790\nSometimes Excel doesn't\ninterpret your data correctly,\n\n218\n00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:13.490\nor because of the way I selected it\nmaybe Excel is unable to interpret it.\n\n219\n00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:14.070\nThat's okay.\n\n220\n00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:16.550\nWe can always go in and fix this.\n\n221\n00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:19.610\nI want to move this kind of down and\nout of the way here.\n\n222\n00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:23.890\nIf it's not right or if I want to make\na change to the data that I'm graphing,\n\n223\n00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:26.180\nI can go up here to Select Data.\n\n224\n00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:30.710\nIf I click that, it opens up one of\nthose handy dandy dialogue boxes, and\n\n225\n00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:34.740\nI can see what I have\nhere is my horizontal,\n\n226\n00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:39.060\nmy category axis labels, and\nI've got my legends for my series.\n\n227\n00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:45.000\nWell, in this case, my series are labeled\n1, Series2, Series3, Series4.\n\n228\n00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.580\nDoesn't really do me a lot of good, so\nI'm gonna edit that, and the problem is,\n\n229\n00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:55.040\nit doesn't know what to name the series,\nbased on these values that I selected.\n\n230\n00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.060\nSo I'm gonna give it a name.\n\n231\n00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.250\nI'm gonna tell it,\nI'm gonna use that picker button, or\n\n232\n00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.280\nas Ronnie calls it, the collapse dialog.\n\n233\n00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.260\nWe're gonna click that,\nand I'm gonna click and\n\n234\n00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.980\ndrag over the names of these months here.\n\n235\n00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.760\nAnd then I'll click it\nagain to bring that back.\n\n236\n00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.840\nAnd now, we should see.\n\n237\n00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.530\nLet's see if it picked it up.\n\n238\n00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:16.750\nYou know what?\nIt didn't like that, Ronnie.\n\n239\n00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:20.140\nLet's undo that, and let's do that again.\n\n240\n00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:20.980\nI think what I'm gonna have to do,\n\n241\n00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.900\nand again this is where playing with your\ndata is really what you've gotta do.\n\n242\n00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:26.470\nYou've gotta try a few\ndifferent things and\n\n243\n00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:28.450\nsee what the best way to represent it is.\n\n244\n00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:30.685\nI think what I'm gonna do here\nis switch rows and columns.\n\n245\n00:12:30.685 --> 00:12:34.570\nAnd this is another thing that we need\nto be able to do, change what's on the X\n\n246\n00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:39.160\nversus what's on the Y axis, so\nI'm gonna switch those around and wow.\n\n247\n00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.260\nIt looks better already, right?\n\n248\n00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.280\nNow I can start to see my data.\n\n249\n00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:48.090\nMy series names are still incorrect, so\nI'm going to go back in and select data,\n\n250\n00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:50.720\nand I'm going to edit this.\n\n251\n00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:55.960\nI'm going to tell it to use this range for\nthe labels, for that series.\n\n252\n00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:58.670\nAnd we'll see how that works out.\n\n253\n00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:01.822\nNow I can see right there it\nlooks a whole lot better.\n\n254\n00:13:01.822 --> 00:13:03.570\nAll right, see.\n\n255\n00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:06.190\nIt's gone through, it's got the names of\nthe month instead of one, two, three,\n\n256\n00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:07.660\nfour, five, six.\n\n257\n00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.970\nI click Ok, and\nnow my chart makes a lot of since.\n\n258\n00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:12.590\nI can see Florida Hospital.\n\n259\n00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:15.110\nI've got each month, and\nI've got a nice line.\n\n260\n00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:20.550\nAnd again, immediately you should be able\nto see that April was the heaviest month.\n\n261\n00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:21.100\nRight?\n\n262\n00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:26.080\nLooking at those raw numbers might not\nhave been as easy to pick out April\n\n263\n00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:30.190\nas the biggest number, but you put it in\na graph, and you can immediately see.\n\n264\n00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.280\nOops, we'll undo that there.\n\n265\n00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.710\nI don't know why that happened.\n\n266\n00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:37.600\nYou can immediately see that\nApril was the biggest month.\n\n267\n00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.310\nAll right?\n\n268\n00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:42.000\nNow let's say I want to add\nanother data series to this.\n\n269\n00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.070\nI wanna compare Florida Hospital\nwith Memorial Hospital, and\n\n270\n00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:47.610\nI wanna see it on that same chart.\n\n271\n00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:48.970\nWell, I don't have to make another chart.\n\n272\n00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:51.470\nI can go back to Select Data.\n\n273\n00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:54.490\nHere's my series, Florida Hospital.\n\n274\n00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:55.510\nI'm gonna click Add.\n\n275\n00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:57.290\nRight?\n\n276\n00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:58.700\nAnd I'll give it a series name.\n\n277\n00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:01.730\nI'm gonna tell it, this is gonna be,\nwell, let's skip one.\n\n278\n00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:03.660\nLet's go down to St Joseph's.\n\n279\n00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.320\nAll right, so there's my series name.\n\n280\n00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.780\nI'm gonna scroll in there.\n\n281\n00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:08.750\nThat's that series name.\n\n282\n00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:13.125\nFor the series value, I'm gonna\ntake what Excel did, take that out,\n\n283\n00:14:13.125 --> 00:14:18.745\ncollapse that and then chose\nwhich will we do, Saint Joseph's?\n\n284\n00:14:18.745 --> 00:14:21.790\nI'll go right behind it there,\nselect that data,\n\n285\n00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:28.558\nclick OK, and\nnow you can see I've got my new series.\n\n286\n00:14:28.558 --> 00:14:32.320\nNow click OK, and we are good to go.\n\n287\n00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:38.740\nOops, as I goof my chart\nup I'm gonna make this.\n\n288\n00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:39.260\nI'm zoomed in.\n\n289\n00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:40.820\nI was like, man, Ronnie,\nit's awfully small.\n\n290\n00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:42.770\nLet's hide this for just a minute.\n\n291\n00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:44.180\nGive us a little more room here.\n\n292\n00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:46.010\nAll right.\n\n293\n00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:46.790\nSo there's my chart.\n\n294\n00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:50.300\nI now can see Florida Hospital and St.\nJoseph's Hospital.\n\n295\n00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:54.290\nAnd again from the numbers, I might not\nhave picked this up, but now I notice that\n\n296\n00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:59.410\nwhen Florida Hospital had that big month,\nSt Joseph's had their worst sales month,\n\n297\n00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:03.200\nor they didn't buy hardly any product\ncompared to the other months maybe or\n\n298\n00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.310\nsomething like that.\n\n299\n00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:08.060\nAgain, it's all about trying\nto interpret that data, and\n\n300\n00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:12.325\nthe visual representation a lot\nof times makes it easier.\n\n301\n00:15:12.325 --> 00:15:13.240\nAll right?\n\n302\n00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:17.310\nAll right, now, so\nwe can add charts very simply, and\n\n303\n00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:21.030\nI keep trying to move my chart,\nand I move elements of the chart.\n\n304\n00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:22.130\nI'm gonna move this down here.\n\n305\n00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:26.240\nWe're gonna talk about moving\nthese guys in just a second.\n\n306\n00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.520\nThese charts are fully customizable.\n\n307\n00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:32.020\nOnce you get your chart made,\nwhether you use that quick analyzer or\n\n308\n00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:36.220\nthe recommended charts or you pick\nyour own chart, and then you go in and\n\n309\n00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:39.670\nadd the data series that you need,\nyou might have to flip it around.\n\n310\n00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:41.390\nRemember, I'll show you that tool again.\n\n311\n00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.520\nSwitch Row and Column.\n\n312\n00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:47.240\nIf your data doesn't seem to make sense,\nit's not doing what you want it to do,\n\n313\n00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.528\nswitch the row and column.\n\n314\n00:15:48.528 --> 00:15:52.620\nSometimes Excel doesn't grab it quite\ncorrectly as you highlight it or it\n\n315\n00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:57.449\ndoesn't see what you're trying to do, and\nyou just have to switch those guys around.\n\n316\n00:15:57.449 --> 00:16:01.163\nYou can add, and\nyou're not stuck with this chart type.\n\n317\n00:16:01.163 --> 00:16:04.258\nThis line chart actually looks\npretty nice for this one, but\n\n318\n00:16:04.258 --> 00:16:06.640\nmaybe I'd rather see it in a bar chart.\n\n319\n00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:09.970\nSo if you saw what I clicked on there,\nlet me do that again.\n\n320\n00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:13.856\nI went to design and\nthen changed chart type,\n\n321\n00:16:13.856 --> 00:16:17.652\nand this time I'm gonna\nchoose a pie chart.\n\n322\n00:16:20.113 --> 00:16:21.960\nThen I'll click okay.\n\n323\n00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.720\nNotice it's just for\nFlorida Hospital for this one.\n\n324\n00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:28.810\nWe can always go in and filter this data.\n\n325\n00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:31.095\nI can change that to St. Joseph's.\n\n326\n00:16:31.095 --> 00:16:34.705\nRight, this little filter button here,\nbrought that up and I can switch back and\n\n327\n00:16:34.705 --> 00:16:38.815\nforth between the two hospitals and\nthat's because with the pie chart again\n\n328\n00:16:38.815 --> 00:16:41.375\nit doesn't need as many data points and\nit doesn't represent,\n\n329\n00:16:41.375 --> 00:16:45.745\nit can't take two different series and\nrepresent them in the same pie, right?\n\n330\n00:16:45.745 --> 00:16:48.385\nSo it has to be separate pies,\nso I only get one there.\n\n331\n00:16:48.385 --> 00:16:52.150\nIf I just want to see February, right?\n\n332\n00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:57.040\nClick apply, although it really wouldn't\nmake a lot of sense to choose just one\n\n333\n00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.700\nmonth in a pie chart cuz\nif there's only one month,\n\n334\n00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.880\nthen it's gonna be 100% of the pie.\n\n335\n00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.540\nBut I wanna show you just\nthe ability to come in here and\n\n336\n00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.230\nchange what your chart is doing.\n\n337\n00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:13.390\nAll right, and like I said,\neverything in here is customizable.\n\n338\n00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:18.740\nYou can change that chart type,\nwe can also change the look and\n\n339\n00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:20.740\nfeel of this chart.\n\n340\n00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:24.230\nOn that design ribbon I've\ngot a drop-down list and\n\n341\n00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:28.340\nI've got a bunch of different\nstyles that I can choose from.\n\n342\n00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:29.130\nAll right.\n\n343\n00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:30.050\nThis one looks pretty nice.\n\n344\n00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:33.290\nIt's got a nice gradient background to it.\n\n345\n00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:35.610\nI can see the actual percentages there.\n\n346\n00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:38.160\nThat's something that my\ndata does not show me.\n\n347\n00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:38.900\nAll right?\n\n348\n00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.820\nLooking at those numbers up there,\n\n349\n00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:43.490\nI can see which months might\nbe bigger than the others.\n\n350\n00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:47.448\nBut now I can see that that biggest month\nthere for this hospital was January.\n\n351\n00:17:47.448 --> 00:17:51.090\nIt was 20% versus their\nlowest month was only 13%.\n\n352\n00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:56.150\nSomething that I couldn't, I didn't\neven have before I made this chart.\n\n353\n00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:58.680\nNow I can actually show percentages.\n\n354\n00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:02.370\nAnd everything, like I said,\neverything is customizable.\n\n355\n00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:03.570\nLike the legend over here.\n\n356\n00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:08.430\nThis is where you can this describes\nthe colors, the blue represents January,\n\n357\n00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:12.560\nthe dark blue represents May, so I guess\nit was May that had their biggest month.\n\n358\n00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:16.300\nAnd I'm gonna zoom back out,\nand you see I can change,\n\n359\n00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:20.610\nI can right click on that legend and\nI've got different options here,\n\n360\n00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:26.600\nwhere I can go in and format that legend\nand I can choose to put it on the top.\n\n361\n00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:30.940\nOr I can put it on the top right,\nor I can put it on the left.\n\n362\n00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:37.640\nDepending on what my data is,\nhow it looks, I can move that around.\n\n363\n00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:39.500\nI've got fill options for it.\n\n364\n00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:40.400\nI can add a glow.\n\n365\n00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:45.560\nSome of these are kind of odd, but\ndepending on what you're trying to do,\n\n366\n00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:50.050\nIf you want to add some glow or\nchange the fill color or the border for\n\n367\n00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:54.940\nthat legend, maybe I want to add a solid\nline and I'll make it, I don't know,\n\n368\n00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:57.390\nsome kind of dark blue or something.\n\n369\n00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:02.780\nNow you can see that blue box around\nthat legend everything is customizable.\n\n370\n00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:07.030\nI can go to a single piece of my pie here,\nand I can right click on that.\n\n371\n00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:08.360\nAnd I'll zoom out.\n\n372\n00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:09.970\nAnd I can change that color.\n\n373\n00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:15.170\nI'm gonna say format data point,\nand we'll go to fill color,\n\n374\n00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:19.450\nand I'll change that to\nsome ugly dark green there.\n\n375\n00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:21.070\nThat's actually the border there, sorry.\n\n376\n00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:22.680\nLet me go to fill.\n\n377\n00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:27.420\nAnd I'll change that to burnt orange or\nsomething, right.\n\n378\n00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:29.170\nAnd you see that changed there.\n\n379\n00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:30.880\nSo you're not stuck.\n\n380\n00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.990\nThe point is excel is gonna make it.\n\n381\n00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:34.650\nIt usually looks pretty good.\n\n382\n00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:39.380\nBut if you need to do the title in company\ncolors rather than that default black.\n\n383\n00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:40.420\nYou can change it.\n\n384\n00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:42.280\nIf you wanna move this title around.\n\n385\n00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:49.520\nIf it gets in the way where it is I can\ndrag this guy over and move it over there.\n\n386\n00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.000\nWe can drag a piece of the pie.\n\n387\n00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:51.930\nSometimes it will let you,\n\n388\n00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:55.170\nlet's see if it will let me move\nthat piece of pie out there.\n\n389\n00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:56.540\nI can break that guy up.\n\n390\n00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:58.620\nHow's that for cool factor, right?\n\n391\n00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:04.240\nSo anything that you can click on in here,\nyou can right click on and\n\n392\n00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.520\nchoose to format.\n\n393\n00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:09.360\nI'm gonna change this back\nto a bar chart real quick.\n\n394\n00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.650\nSo I'm gonna close my properties,\ngo back to design,\n\n395\n00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:15.910\nand let's change this back to,\nactually I'll do a column.\n\n396\n00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:18.750\nYeah, like that.\n\n397\n00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.990\nAll right, so there's my St.\nJoseph's Hospital.\n\n398\n00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:28.360\nBecause I wanted to show you that you\ncan show the data values out there.\n\n399\n00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:32.910\nIf I right click on this guy,\nI can choose format data labels.\n\n400\n00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:34.420\nI can change their color.\n\n401\n00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:39.830\nI can again, it's just about anything you\nwant can be customized, just select it.\n\n402\n00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:42.430\nIf you wanna change the font for\nthis over here.\n\n403\n00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:47.540\nIf you wanna put tick marks at\nthe half way point, you can.\n\n404\n00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:53.810\nWe can come over here,\nif I can get rid of my styling there.\n\n405\n00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:56.000\nThere's my access options.\n\n406\n00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.190\nIf I need to see tick marks\na little more often than that.\n\n407\n00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:04.310\nI want to see major tick marks inside and\nyou see those little lines popping,\n\n408\n00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:05.630\nlet's do minors as well.\n\n409\n00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:06.900\nThat will make it a little more visible.\n\n410\n00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:11.470\nSo now if you look over here\nyou see this little ruler like?\n\n411\n00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:14.170\nThat's what I just added\nby adding those tick marks.\n\n412\n00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:18.010\nSo it's whatever you want\nto do to these charts.\n\n413\n00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:20.580\nAs far as moving them around,\nRonnie, pretty straightforward.\n\n414\n00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:24.910\nYou've seen me, when I hover over my\nchart, I get the little four-way arrow.\n\n415\n00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.290\nRight, and so I can drag this chart\naround so it's not overlapping my data.\n\n416\n00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:35.330\nI can also go to my design ribbon\nwhere I have my chart selector.\n\n417\n00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:37.100\nRemember those are contextual ribbons.\n\n418\n00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:39.680\nIf I click away from the chart,\nthey go away.\n\n419\n00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.680\nClick on the chart, they come back.\n\n420\n00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:46.980\nI go to design, I can do move chart and\nI can move this to a new sheet.\n\n421\n00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:54.037\nAnd I can call it, I don't know, I'll\ncall it, what is this, St. Joseph's And\n\n422\n00:21:54.037 --> 00:21:58.300\nI'll click okay and\nnow I've got that chart on its own sheet.\n\n423\n00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:01.810\nRight, so I can make it much bigger\nbecause I've got the room there.\n\n424\n00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:04.040\nWhat else?\n\n425\n00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.480\nFormat ribbon,\nwe haven't even looked at that yet.\n\n426\n00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:12.090\nIf we wanna add, let's go to our, I don't\nknow, our data points here or our title.\n\n427\n00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:16.610\nAnd let's go format and\nadd some fancy word art to it,\n\n428\n00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:21.120\nour word art styles here,\nsee what happened to Saint Joseph's there?\n\n429\n00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:25.410\nNow it's all,\nI don't know how to describe that,\n\n430\n00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:27.750\nlooks like a neon light or something.\n\n431\n00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:30.890\nSo you've got all these\ndifferent styles you can add.\n\n432\n00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:32.880\nWe can add some drop shadow to it.\n\n433\n00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:37.120\nAnd we'll show you some of these little\ntools in our next episode when we get to\n\n434\n00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:42.500\ninserting objects I tell you,\nI'm gonna have to bring that ribbon back.\n\n435\n00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:45.340\nI'm one of those people that just\ncan't stand that auto hiding.\n\n436\n00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:49.390\nI try to do it, to make more room,\nbut it does drive me crazy.\n\n437\n00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:51.550\nIf I don't wanna show the legend,\nlet me show you,\n\n438\n00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:52.560\nI haven't shown you this one yet.\n\n439\n00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:56.670\nThat little plus sign,\nthe blue paint brush is for styles.\n\n440\n00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:59.530\nSo I can quickly change\nthe style of that chart.\n\n441\n00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:02.290\nLove the live preview that I can get.\n\n442\n00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:04.790\nThe filter lets me filter out data.\n\n443\n00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:09.630\nIf I wanna see both hospitals again now\nthat I'm not on that pie chart anymore,\n\n444\n00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:11.170\nI can put both hospitals.\n\n445\n00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:12.070\nAnd see, that's perfect for\n\n446\n00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:15.790\nus here in Gazo, we got a little gator\ngoing with that orange and blue.\n\n447\n00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:17.470\nI think that actually\nlooks pretty darn good.\n\n448\n00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:21.580\nIf I don't want to show the legend,\nI can just uncheck legend.\n\n449\n00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:23.590\nI can take off the grid line.\n\n450\n00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:25.360\nI can put the legend back.\n\n451\n00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.650\nYou can even do trend lines in here.\n\n452\n00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:29.810\nI'll do it based on Florida hospital so\n\n453\n00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:34.400\nI can see that over the course of six\nmonths, I'm actually on a downward slope.\n\n454\n00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:38.130\nAgain, this is information and I'll zoom\nin so you can see that trend line there.\n\n455\n00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:43.070\nThis is information that you're not\ngoing to get from those numbers.\n\n456\n00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:47.140\nHere it's graphically showing you that\nover the course of the six months,\n\n457\n00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:48.760\nthere's been some up and downs.\n\n458\n00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.079\nBut overall, it's actually going down.\n\n459\n00:23:51.079 --> 00:23:55.023\nI might have missed that fact if I\nwas just looking at the numbers and\n\n460\n00:23:55.023 --> 00:23:56.653\nnot looking at the graphs.\n\n461\n00:23:56.653 --> 00:23:58.098\nThere is no doubt, Mike,\n\n462\n00:23:58.098 --> 00:24:02.107\nthat being able to chart the data,\nright, being able to take all that and\n\n463\n00:24:02.107 --> 00:24:06.052\npresent it the way that we need to is\nwhat's gonna give those people that\n\n464\n00:24:06.052 --> 00:24:10.580\nare actually requiring the data to\nmake good, solid business decisions.\n\n465\n00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:14.260\nWhat we don't ever want to do, and this is\nwhat Excel really does help us and Mike's\n\n466\n00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:18.600\njust showing us this, is that when we make\na chart and we don't know what it means.\n\n467\n00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.950\nAnd I've seen that before,\nwhere people made a chart and\n\n468\n00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:22.520\nthen you ask them to explain it.\n\n469\n00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:26.700\nAnd you're still looking at a chart going,\nwhat does that really mean?\n\n470\n00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:28.190\nExcel, Mike showed us,\n\n471\n00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:32.350\nthat by using the wizard that's actually\nright there, just selecting the data.\n\n472\n00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:33.100\nThat it says hey,\n\n473\n00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:36.870\nhere's the type of chart we believe\nthat suits this particular type of data.\n\n474\n00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:40.416\nAnd then going back in and understanding,\nif you know what data you want to present,\n\n475\n00:24:40.416 --> 00:24:45.310\nthat you can manually present that data\nand make it display however you want to.\n\n476\n00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:47.490\nAnd that is really important, too.\n\n477\n00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:52.250\nA lot of times, we do, we put too much\ndata inside of what we think people need.\n\n478\n00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:56.150\nAnd all they're really asking for is, I\nneed to make this decision in the next six\n\n479\n00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:59.722\nhours, Mike, but\nyou've given me 1,000 rows of data.\n\n480\n00:24:59.722 --> 00:25:04.490\nNow you've given me this chart, and this\npie chart is split up into 62 different\n\n481\n00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:07.610\npieces, and they're still\ntrying to make that decision.\n\n482\n00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:11.490\nSo knowing your data is gonna be\nimportant when you make this chart.\n\n483\n00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:13.540\nNow, we've been playing\nwith this set of data so\n\n484\n00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:15.990\nMike knows it fairly well,\nbut that's the same thing.\n\n485\n00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:17.670\nIf you're looking at it,\nthat doesn't make any sense,\n\n486\n00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:19.870\nit's because you don't know the data.\n\n487\n00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:24.860\nThe better that you actually\nunderstand your data, the more that\n\n488\n00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:28.850\nyou know what you want to display,\nthen you can take the time to format it.\n\n489\n00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:30.940\nNow, Mike,\nyou talked about spending hours and\n\n490\n00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:32.780\nactually formatting something like this.\n\n491\n00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:34.210\nAnd don't get me wrong, you can do that.\n\n492\n00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:36.210\nAnd you can see why you can do that.\n\n493\n00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:39.780\nBut remember, a lot of times,\nthis is done quickly and on the fly and\n\n494\n00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:42.950\nyou just need to make it presentable\nmore than anything else.\n\n495\n00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:45.080\nSo, Mike,\nanything else as far as charts go?\n\n496\n00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:48.580\n>> Yeah, I did want to show you guys what\nhappens when you try to do too much, so\n\n497\n00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.860\nI'm gonna come over here to\nanother one of my sheets, and\n\n498\n00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:52.800\nyou guys have seen this sheet before.\n\n499\n00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:56.070\nThere's about 250 orders,\nI think, in here, so\n\n500\n00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:59.270\nI'm gonna see if I can select all of this.\n\n501\n00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:04.040\nSo I selected all of that data and\nI'm gonna go Insert, and\n\n502\n00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.099\nI'll see what Excel recommends here.\n\n503\n00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:09.870\n>> And it's like,\nI don't even know how to do this.\n\n504\n00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:10.420\nYou can see it.\n\n505\n00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:13.230\nIt just doesn't look quite right at all.\n\n506\n00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:17.180\nLet me show you what would happen\nif I tried to do a line chart here.\n\n507\n00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:18.730\nAnd there you can see.\n\n508\n00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:20.070\nI mean, that's, yeah.\n\n509\n00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:23.790\nLet's go ahead and do that one, all right?\n\n510\n00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:27.340\nNow I'll zoom in for you, and\nit's just too much information.\n\n511\n00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:33.141\nWe could try getting rid of-\nthe labels aren't even on there and\n\n512\n00:26:33.141 --> 00:26:36.290\nit still just looks atrocious.\n\n513\n00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:40.050\nThere's no way to make sense\nout of that much data.\n\n514\n00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:42.610\nYou really wanna be careful\nin choosing your data.\n\n515\n00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:44.310\nThe other thing I'll show you, sorry,\n\n516\n00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:47.860\nI'm trying to get rid of that chart,\nand I don't know.\n\n517\n00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:51.210\nI think it's so much data,\nExcel is actually locking up,\n\n518\n00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:53.920\ntrying to make sense of\nall that data there.\n\n519\n00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.210\nLet me go back up here to\nthis little summary area,\n\n520\n00:26:56.210 --> 00:27:02.430\ncuz I did wanna show you one more thing,\nif I can get myself to scroll over.\n\n521\n00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:05.010\nI was gonna stick this guy in here.\n\n522\n00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:09.329\nInsert a chart, and we're gonna just do\na simple bar chart again, or column chart.\n\n523\n00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:15.070\nRight, and you'll see that it\ngraphed everything, right?\n\n524\n00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:17.220\nIt actually did a pretty good job.\n\n525\n00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:20.807\nEach one of the hospitals is listed here,\nand then for\n\n526\n00:27:20.807 --> 00:27:24.637\neach hospital I've got total orders,\ntotal quantity,\n\n527\n00:27:24.637 --> 00:27:30.490\ntotal average quantity and average amount,\nso five columns for each one of those.\n\n528\n00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:34.140\nBut one of them is so big,\nthat the others, to keep it all to scale,\n\n529\n00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:36.410\nthe others are almost meaningless.\n\n530\n00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:38.620\nI can't really tell what's going on there.\n\n531\n00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:42.190\nBut I wanted to show you this, and the\nfact that, similar to when you're creating\n\n532\n00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:47.550\nthose formulas, Excel would draw colored\nboxes around what you were working with,\n\n533\n00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:51.030\nthat formula, and you could actually\nmove those instead of typing.\n\n534\n00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:52.320\nI can do the same thing here.\n\n535\n00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:56.360\nI can say oops, I didn't mean to chart\nall that Excel, let's adjust that.\n\n536\n00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:59.699\nI can drag this over and\nsay I just wanna see the totals.\n\n537\n00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:01.470\nAll right?\n\n538\n00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:04.080\nAnd now I've got Florida Hospital.\n\n539\n00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:07.050\nEach one of those hospitals\nlisted individually, and\n\n540\n00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:09.420\nI'm looking at the total in this case.\n\n541\n00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:13.990\nI can drag this whole box over and\nchange that to Total Quantity.\n\n542\n00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:16.980\nAnd it completely changed\nwhat's being graphed there.\n\n543\n00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:19.810\nAnd this doesn't need\nthe word customer in it.\n\n544\n00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:23.930\nSo I could actually drop that down,\nget rid of that unnecessary column.\n\n545\n00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:28.060\nSometimes I find looking at\nthe boxes that Excel draws\n\n546\n00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:33.050\na little bit easier than working\nwith this dialogue box and\n\n547\n00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:37.950\ntrying to figure out what they mean by\ncategory access and series and adding.\n\n548\n00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:39.310\nHey, just let me do it graphically.\n\n549\n00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:44.310\nJust let me drag these guys around,\nand I can see total orders, right?\n\n550\n00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:46.320\nSo, play around with some\nof those different options,\n\n551\n00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.000\nwhen it goes to making those charts.\n\n552\n00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.270\nAnd after a few charts,\nyou'll get pretty good at it, I think,\n\n553\n00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:53.290\nand Excel makes it pretty easy.\n\n554\n00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:54.040\nWell, all right, Mike.\n\n555\n00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:57.620\nThank you again for those demonstrations\nof how we can create different charts.\n\n556\n00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:00.226\nAnd remembering the key there\nis to take our data and\n\n557\n00:29:00.226 --> 00:29:03.105\nto put it into what we know\nthat needs to be presented to.\n\n558\n00:29:03.105 --> 00:29:06.730\nWell, that's a great place for\nus to go and end this episode, then.\n\n559\n00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:09.720\nSigning off for ITPro.TV, I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n560\n00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:10.400\n>> And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n561\n00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.439\n>> And we'll see you next

00:00:20.745\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today we're\ntaking a look at Microsoft Excel 2016.\n\n4\n00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:23.950\nAnd we're specifically gonna be getting\ninto the area where we need to actually\n\n5\n00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.260\nenhance the data that\nwe're actually seeing.\n\n6\n00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.230\nAnd we're not just talking\nabout formatting the data.\n\n7\n00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.850\nWe're talking about adding in more objects\ninto our data, so that we can present\n\n8\n00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.645\nexactly what we want to because\nsometimes data can become very boring.\n\n9\n00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:39.425\nAnd who better to help us than Mr.\nExcel himself, Mike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:39.425 --> 00:00:40.065\nHow's it going, Mike?\n\n11\n00:00:40.065 --> 00:00:42.991\n>> I don't know I've been told I'm\npretty boring as well [LAUGH] but\n\n12\n00:00:42.991 --> 00:00:45.005\nwe're gonna try to spice\nit up a little bit.\n\n13\n00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:46.270\nAnd Ronnie's right.\n\n14\n00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.810\nAnd, thanks for having me here, and\nI can't wait to do some more Excel.\n\n15\n00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.210\nWhen we talk about things like smart\nart and word art and shapes and\n\n16\n00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.670\nputting those into our spreadsheets, we're\ndoing it sometimes to enhance the data,\n\n17\n00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.450\nbut a lot of times, we're doing this\ncompletely separate from the data, right?\n\n18\n00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.830\nWe've got our spread sheets that do\na good job of crunching the numbers and\n\n19\n00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.008\ngiving us our totals and our averages.\n\n20\n00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:14.620\nWe've got our charts that are good\nvisual representations of that data, so\n\n21\n00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.530\nwe can spot trends and\nanomalies and things like that.\n\n22\n00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.830\nBut sometimes we're using Excel for other\nthings, like we wanna make some diagrams,\n\n23\n00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.130\nor some hierarchical charts, or\nsome flowcharts, or matrices, and\n\n24\n00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.855\nthings like that, and some people might\nnot think of Excel when it comes to that.\n\n25\n00:01:33.855 --> 00:01:35.835\nBut Excel is very good at it.\n\n26\n00:01:35.835 --> 00:01:39.675\nThey've actually added a lot of\nreally cool features to Excel.\n\n27\n00:01:39.675 --> 00:01:41.785\nAnd they're really easy to work with.\n\n28\n00:01:41.785 --> 00:01:46.320\nAnd you can make some very professional\nlooking documents using Excel and\n\n29\n00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.000\ntheir built in tools like SmartArt and\n\n30\n00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.570\ninserting pictures and word art and\nshapes and things like that.\n\n31\n00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.360\nSo that's what I'm going to show you in\nthis episode is we're just going to kind\n\n32\n00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.430\nof play a little bit because that's\nreally what it comes down to.\n\n33\n00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.580\nWe're not, again,\nnot trying to analyse data in this case.\n\n34\n00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.010\nWe're creating spreadsheets,\n\n35\n00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.590\nbut unlike spreadsheets we're\nnormally used to working with.\n\n36\n00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.940\nThese are not going be\nloaded full of data.\n\n37\n00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.870\nSo let's take a look at what we\ncan do using Excel's cool tools.\n\n38\n00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.860\nSo what I've got here is\nbasically just a blank workbook.\n\n39\n00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.800\nI have added a couple things over\nhere where I've got some steps.\n\n40\n00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.340\nAll right?\n\n41\n00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.670\nAnd if you've seen any of my\nother courses in our library,\n\n42\n00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.900\nI love the security side of things,\nI deal with the CEH,\n\n43\n00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.230\nthat certified ethical hacker,\nand classes like that.\n\n44\n00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.600\nAnd one of the things we always talk\nabout is the hacking life cycle and\n\n45\n00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.610\nthere's five steps to it.\n\n46\n00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.110\nAnd we're not here to learn that.\n\n47\n00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.580\nBut I can represent those\nsteps in a list like this, and\n\n48\n00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.520\nit gets the point across, right?\n\n49\n00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.210\nThere's five steps, it's a numbered list.\n\n50\n00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.650\nMeaning that we need to do\nthem in that order, right?\n\n51\n00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.280\nThat's not very visually appealing.\n\n52\n00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.260\nIf I want to make this, but\n\n53\n00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.690\nExcel gives me the ability to do\nsome really cool things with this.\n\n54\n00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.550\nLet's see what I mean.\n\n55\n00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.290\nOver here on the Insert ribbon,\nthere's this illustrations area.\n\n56\n00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.670\nThat's kind of where\nwe're gonna focus in on.\n\n57\n00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.080\nThere's pictures and online pictures.\n\n58\n00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.210\nI'll show you both of\nthose in just a second.\n\n59\n00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.480\nThere's shapes.\n\n60\n00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.450\nNow let me just zoom in a little bit here.\n\n61\n00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.960\nI got my Shapes drop-down list, and\n\n62\n00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.310\nyou can see these are things like\nlines and rectangles and basic shapes.\n\n63\n00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.740\nThere's smiley faces and\nhearts and all kinds of fun stuff.\n\n64\n00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.660\nIf we go below that,\nis what we call SmartArt.\n\n65\n00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.690\nSmart Art is pretty cool.\n\n66\n00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.050\nThat's what we're gonna do now.\n\n67\n00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.762\nAnd then right below\nthat is a screen shot.\n\n68\n00:03:31.762 --> 00:03:33.260\nWhich is, I'll be honest with you guys,\n\n69\n00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.220\nI wasn't even aware of this until a few\nmonths ago playing around with Excel.\n\n70\n00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.100\nI didn't realize it had this capability\n\n71\n00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.270\nwhere it'll grab any window that's\ncurrently open on your computer.\n\n72\n00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.360\nYou can just hit this drop down list, and\n\n73\n00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.810\nit will show you all the different\nwindows that are open.\n\n74\n00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.500\nAnd you can take a quick screenshot,\nand you can dump it in there.\n\n75\n00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.570\nTalk about an easy way to make\na tutorial or a step by step for\n\n76\n00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.000\nteaching your users how to\nlog on to your VPN, right?.\n\n77\n00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.530\nYou go through the steps\non your own machine.\n\n78\n00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.600\nEvery so\noften stopping to take a screenshot,\n\n79\n00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.760\ndump it into Excel, and\nyou're good to go, right?\n\n80\n00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.920\nYou can really get\ncreative with this stuff.\n\n81\n00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.820\nSo let me show you what\nthey mean by SmartArt.\n\n82\n00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.660\nSmartArt is art that's intelligent,\n\n83\n00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.080\nI guess is what they're trying to say,\nbut it is.\n\n84\n00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.480\nThere's several different\ncategories over here.\n\n85\n00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.131\nThere are lists, processes.\n\n86\n00:04:22.131 --> 00:04:25.650\nSo if you're developing software or\nsomething like that, and\n\n87\n00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.070\nyou need to demonstrate the steps\ninvolved or some kind of training\n\n88\n00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.550\nprocess that you have to go through,\nthere's cycles, there's hierarchy,\n\n89\n00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.430\nwhich is great for organizational charts,\nthere's relationship information,\n\n90\n00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.090\nand not talking about Dr.\nPhil or anything like that, you know,\n\n91\n00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:48.860\nrelationships between our data,\nmatrices, pyramids, again with pictures,\n\n92\n00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.940\nand then of course you can go out online\nand find additional ones as well.\n\n93\n00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.510\nI'll do a cycle, since we're talking about\n\n94\n00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.360\nmy example is doing the the hacking\nlifecycle and it's circular.\n\n95\n00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.680\n>> Cyclycle.\n\n96\n00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.100\n>> Cyclical, thank you, Ronnie.\n\n97\n00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.220\nWhere you know it's\na cycle that starts over.\n\n98\n00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.150\nSo I can go through here and\nI can see several different options and\n\n99\n00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.020\nI'll go ahead and click on some of these.\n\n100\n00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.608\nAnd you can see there's a basic cycle,\n\n101\n00:05:14.608 --> 00:05:18.490\nI've got a text cycle,\nand a few different ones.\n\n102\n00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.970\nBut there's some really\nfancy ones like gears.\n\n103\n00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:26.140\nIt would take me a month and a day to try\nto draw all this stuff out in Photoshop.\n\n104\n00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.980\nI'm not the Photoshop guru.\n\n105\n00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.340\nBut I don't have to,\nit's all right here in Excel.\n\n106\n00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.000\nI could do like a pie.\n\n107\n00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.460\nOne of my favorite ones is\nthis circle arrow process.\n\n108\n00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.400\nI don't know why,\nI just think it looks cool, right?\n\n109\n00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.670\nBut let's use a relatively\nsimple one here,\n\n110\n00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:45.010\nwe'll do this basic cycle for\nnow, and I'll click okay.\n\n111\n00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.280\nAnd what that does is it\ndumps out this SmartArt.\n\n112\n00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.430\nAnd you can see it's an object.\n\n113\n00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.980\nIt's not part of a cell or\nanything like that.\n\n114\n00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.820\nI can move this around and\nI simply click where it says text, and\n\n115\n00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.469\nI put in reconnaissance.\n\n116\n00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:02.120\nWhich I can barely spell.\n\n117\n00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.000\nAnd that looks a little small there.\n\n118\n00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.920\nWe'll zoom in so you can see that.\n\n119\n00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.670\nI'll make this bigger in a minute.\n\n120\n00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.480\nStep two, right?\n\n121\n00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.142\nIt's going to be my scanning phase and\n\n122\n00:06:14.142 --> 00:06:18.724\nthen I go into gaining,\nif I can click in there.\n\n123\n00:06:18.724 --> 00:06:20.564\nGaining access.\n\n124\n00:06:24.404 --> 00:06:26.644\nMaintaining access.\n\n125\n00:06:29.884 --> 00:06:34.584\nAnd we'll finish it off\nwith covering tracks.\n\n126\n00:06:36.684 --> 00:06:43.344\nOkay, and as I zoom in here you can see\nthis little cycle that I just made.\n\n127\n00:06:43.344 --> 00:06:48.060\nAnd let me scroll up just a little bit so\nyou can see that.\n\n128\n00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.910\nSo pretty cool, now again,\na little bit small.\n\n129\n00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.680\nI might play around with some\nof my options on my font size.\n\n130\n00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.000\nI might try to think of a different word.\n\n131\n00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.410\nI could actually replace\nthat with Footprinting,\n\n132\n00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.060\nwhich maybe is a little bit smaller,\nso it shows up a little bit better.\n\n133\n00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.740\nAnd that's my SmartArt.\n\n134\n00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:08.760\nYou think okay, great Mike,\n\n135\n00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:12.220\nthat was pretty cool, but\nthere's more I can do with this.\n\n136\n00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:16.200\nEach one of these shapes is basically\nan object that I can work with.\n\n137\n00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.940\nYou see I have a little\nrotate option up here,\n\n138\n00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.450\nI could start rotating these guys around.\n\n139\n00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:27.620\nI can choose different styles, and\nthis is where it can get really fancy.\n\n140\n00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:32.810\nI can make, look at those buttons,\nthey kinda have a glossy look to them.\n\n141\n00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.700\nThere's a three dimensional\nkind of thing we can do to it.\n\n142\n00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.070\nI couldn't do this on my own.\n\n143\n00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:42.620\nJust, you know, even just doing Photoshop.\n\n144\n00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:47.710\nMake this guy a little bit bigger so\nwe can see it a little bit better and\n\n145\n00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:51.520\nright there,\nI'm already making this pretty darn fancy.\n\n146\n00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.610\nThen I can go in here and\nI can change colors.\n\n147\n00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:57.630\nMaybe I want to make this a little\nmore of a colorful process.\n\n148\n00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:58.410\nRight?\n\n149\n00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:59.470\nVery easy to do.\n\n150\n00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:03.696\nIf I want to go back in and change that\ntext, I can go ahead and change that.\n\n151\n00:08:03.696 --> 00:08:05.143\nI just select it.\n\n152\n00:08:05.143 --> 00:08:07.512\nType there, fix it, do whatever I want.\n\n153\n00:08:07.512 --> 00:08:08.949\nAnd I'm good to go.\n\n154\n00:08:08.949 --> 00:08:12.260\nSo very easy to work with there.\n\n155\n00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.700\nAnd there's many different\nformats that I can use for\n\n156\n00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.400\nthis particular one, not too many.\n\n157\n00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:24.140\nAnd if I goof things up too bad,\nI can always choose to reset the graphic.\n\n158\n00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:28.530\nAnd that goes back to the default\nformat for that graphic.\n\n159\n00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:32.080\nWe'll go back,\nI really do kind of like that one.\n\n160\n00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.570\nNow each one of these\nis actually changeable.\n\n161\n00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:37.410\nEvery little detail, similar to charts.\n\n162\n00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:42.840\nAll I did was right click on this little\ndisk here, and this option came out.\n\n163\n00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:46.440\nI'm gonna do the chart itself if I can.\n\n164\n00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:51.500\nWe'll say format object, not the chart\nI should say, but the shapes.\n\n165\n00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:56.040\nAnd then if I wanna change that fill\ncolor, I can change it to a gradient.\n\n166\n00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.845\nThere you can see my different\ngradient options down there.\n\n167\n00:08:59.845 --> 00:09:03.145\nI'm not the most creative one\nto try to do this kind of thing.\n\n168\n00:09:03.145 --> 00:09:04.765\nI'm very left brained.\n\n169\n00:09:04.765 --> 00:09:08.475\nSo you guys are on your own,\ndeciding what colors look best and\n\n170\n00:09:08.475 --> 00:09:09.975\nwhat gradients look best.\n\n171\n00:09:09.975 --> 00:09:15.990\nI just want to teach you all about the\ndifferent options that we have available.\n\n172\n00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.600\nLet's do another.\n\n173\n00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.650\nWe could change this up.\n\n174\n00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:21.930\nLet's change it to this one here,\nall right?\n\n175\n00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:23.670\nSo there's another look.\n\n176\n00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.610\nNow I don't quite like that one as much,\n\n177\n00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:29.305\nmaybe I wanna flip this around\nto something like that.\n\n178\n00:09:29.305 --> 00:09:35.865\nAgain, just very professional looking art\nthat I can insert into my spreadsheet,\n\n179\n00:09:36.895 --> 00:09:41.775\nchange the colors, maybe we wanna go again\na little more colorful with that one.\n\n180\n00:09:41.775 --> 00:09:42.845\nHow's that?\n\n181\n00:09:42.845 --> 00:09:48.565\nAnd you can see, I'm gonna scroll back\nup a little bit and move this chart or\n\n182\n00:09:48.565 --> 00:09:52.410\nthis art over just a wee bit,\nyou know what do you think Ronnie?\n\n183\n00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:56.520\nDo you like this list over here or do\nyou like this diagram right here better?\n\n184\n00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:57.880\n>> Well when we take a look at it right,\n\n185\n00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:01.530\nwhat we can do is take what Mike\nsaid that very simple list and\n\n186\n00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:05.380\nadd a little bit of enhancement to it\nto allow the eye to flow down it and\n\n187\n00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:09.550\nthis really does help when somebody is\nlooking at mounds and mounds of data.\n\n188\n00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:11.630\nAnd you want to break that\ndata up a little bit,\n\n189\n00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:15.660\nyou might do something like\nthis type of smart art here\n\n190\n00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:19.756\nto show that progress of things that\nare actually going on in your company.\n\n191\n00:10:19.756 --> 00:10:22.800\nInstead of the actually going\nfrom like we said page to page,\n\n192\n00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.260\nthey see this every once in a while, and\n\n193\n00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.490\nit really does add the impact\nthat we need it to have in there.\n\n194\n00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:31.420\nAnd we did show, or Mike did show you,\nseveral different ways and\n\n195\n00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.270\nseveral different templates\nthat are in there.\n\n196\n00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:37.750\nTo create different types of word art or,\nI keep saying word art, smart art.\n\n197\n00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:41.070\nAnd a lot of times you also see things\nlike organizational charts in there, and\n\n198\n00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:42.930\nstuff like that, and\nthis is really helpful.\n\n199\n00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:46.030\nBecause I thought just drawing\nout an organizational chart,\n\n200\n00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:47.610\nhow difficult could that be?\n\n201\n00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:50.120\nWell start off from the top and\nthen try and draw that and\n\n202\n00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:53.740\nsee how many times you erase everything\nif you were just doing it on paper.\n\n203\n00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:57.470\nDoing it like this you really can\nput objects the way you want to be\n\n204\n00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:00.390\nable to see them and\nthat actually makes it so much easier.\n\n205\n00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:03.500\nSo it's a great way to enhance anything\nthat you're actually trying to display or\n\n206\n00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.540\nreport to someone.\n\n207\n00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:06.340\n>> Absolutely,\nall right let's take a look.\n\n208\n00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:08.110\nI'm gonna go ahead and delete that one.\n\n209\n00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:10.060\nAnd let's do some more.\n\n210\n00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.540\nWe will,\nI told you I'd do a hierarchical chart.\n\n211\n00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:16.230\nLet me show you that real quick, and\nthen, we move on into some images and\n\n212\n00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:17.750\nborders and things like that.\n\n213\n00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:20.720\nCuz a hierarchy is another\nvery common one to do.\n\n214\n00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:24.110\nI've got my organizational chart,\npicture organizational chart.\n\n215\n00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:27.520\nIf you have pictures of all your\nemployees, that can be extremely helpful,\n\n216\n00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.400\nespecially for somebody that's new.\n\n217\n00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.860\nTo have a nice org charts that's\ngot images next to each name, so\n\n218\n00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.300\nthat when I see the boss\nwalking down the hallway,\n\n219\n00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.090\nwe're crossing in the hall,\nI don't completely ignore him.\n\n220\n00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:42.660\nThat was the CEO that just walked by and\nI didn't bother to say anything,\n\n221\n00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.790\nI didn't know who he was,\nI'm relatively new here right?\n\n222\n00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:47.750\nIf I had a nice picture org chart I\nwould have recognized him and going,\n\n223\n00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:49.560\nhow are you doing this morning or\nsomething.\n\n224\n00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:53.240\nSo you can do these org charts,\nI'll do a simple one there.\n\n225\n00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:57.790\nEasy to work with,\nwe can type in the top level,\n\n226\n00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:04.170\nall right, and then we'll maybe\nput a subordinate down here.\n\n227\n00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:07.200\nI don't wanna use any names around\nhere and make anybody angry.\n\n228\n00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:12.720\nBut you've got subordinates, you've\ngot the next level in your hierarchy,\n\n229\n00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:17.470\nyou can start moving these around if\nyou need to, to make it different.\n\n230\n00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:18.690\nYou can rotate them.\n\n231\n00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:22.595\nAgain, you've got all the different\nstyles, so if I want to make a really\n\n232\n00:12:22.595 --> 00:12:27.960\nfancy-looking one I can, one that looks\nlike it took me hours to develop.\n\n233\n00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.060\nExcel did it for me, right?\n\n234\n00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.960\nSo lots of cool things you\ncan do with that smarter.\n\n235\n00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:36.140\nLet me move on to our next topic though.\n\n236\n00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.950\nBecause I could play with smart art for\nhours.\n\n237\n00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:43.060\nAnother thing we could do again was the\nimages, all right if you have pictures on\n\n238\n00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:46.800\nyour machine that you want to put in here,\nyou can simply click pictures and\n\n239\n00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:52.660\nyou can browse and find an image and\nyou can insert it into your spreadsheet.\n\n240\n00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.330\nSo if you're making that PO order or\nsomething,\n\n241\n00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:58.810\nthat purchase order and you want to put\nyour logo up there or something like that,\n\n242\n00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:00.960\nall you have to do is insert it.\n\n243\n00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:05.080\nYou can then work with it inside excel,\nyou can change its size, and\n\n244\n00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.490\nwe can add some pretty cool effects.\n\n245\n00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:11.030\nI'm gonna move this over, I'm gonna\ndrop this pictures styles, and you'll\n\n246\n00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:15.630\nsee as you I hover over, there's all these\ndifferent styles that I can add to these\n\n247\n00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:20.350\nimages, I especially like the ones\nthat have a bit of reflection to them.\n\n248\n00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:23.259\nIt's just pretty neat stuff\nthat you can do in here.\n\n249\n00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:25.060\nAll right.\n\n250\n00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.610\nWhat else we wanna show you with pictures.\n\n251\n00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:28.980\nDifferent pictures effect.\n\n252\n00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:34.010\nBasically the styles here, these preset\nstyles include usually a boarder,\n\n253\n00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:35.610\neffect and a layout.\n\n254\n00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:37.440\nIf you don't want one of\nthose preset styles and\n\n255\n00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.740\nyou just wanna do one of the effects,\nyou can come down here.\n\n256\n00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:44.580\nAnd you can choose the move\nthis over again this way.\n\n257\n00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:45.614\nSo you can see this.\n\n258\n00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:50.980\nAs I go to like shadows,\nI can add shadows.\n\n259\n00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:54.620\nYou notice it immediately, let's zoom\nin just to weave it there, Ronnie.\n\n260\n00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:57.490\nIt really gives it\na three dimensional look.\n\n261\n00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:59.980\nThat it's floating over that page.\n\n262\n00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:03.850\nAnd I can choose where that shadow's\ngoing, or I can do inner shadows.\n\n263\n00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:07.130\nThere's reflections, so\nthis one right there's that's a glow.\n\n264\n00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:09.430\nI can glow around my shapes.\n\n265\n00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:10.810\nThere's reflection so\n\n266\n00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:14.750\nI can make a you see the paws kinda\na showing up underneath there.\n\n267\n00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:17.550\nWe got soft edges which\ndoesn't really work with this.\n\n268\n00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:22.680\nBut with photos you know you lose that\ncrisp line sometimes that you get\n\n269\n00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:26.090\nwhen you cut an image out\nthere's bevels that you can do.\n\n270\n00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:28.960\nIt doesn't really work for\nthis particular picture.\n\n271\n00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.260\nThere's 3D rotation.\n\n272\n00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:34.100\nSo I can start rotating these guys\naround again in 3D, which again,\n\n273\n00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:37.770\nfor that particular shape doesn't\nreally work all that well.\n\n274\n00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:39.250\nLet's go and delete that and\n\n275\n00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:43.240\nthe other one I wanna show you\nis insert online pictures.\n\n276\n00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.800\nWhat I really like about this is\nMicrosoft will actually go out and\n\n277\n00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:50.440\nsearch I'm going to look for\nmedicine, since we're an Rx company.\n\n278\n00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:53.120\nAll right, these come up and show me,\n\n279\n00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.850\nthe search results are images\nlicensed under creative comments.\n\n280\n00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:01.300\nSo that means for the most part, I can\nprobably use these images without having\n\n281\n00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:06.720\nto worry about anybody filing\nagainst me or anything like that.\n\n282\n00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.400\nHopefully we can do that.\n\n283\n00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.680\nYou can search the entire web,\nbut keep in mind,\n\n284\n00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.510\nyou need to make sure that you\nhave rights to use those images.\n\n285\n00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:15.590\nI'll select that image and I'll insert it.\n\n286\n00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:19.129\nIt's gonna download it from the web and\nit's gonna put it in my spreadsheet.\n\n287\n00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:20.970\nAnd there we go.\n\n288\n00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:24.660\nNow I can resize,\nit's a little bit big for my taste.\n\n289\n00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:29.350\nSo I'll resize that, put it back up here,\nmaybe make it a little smaller.\n\n290\n00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:33.110\nSo this might become part of my\nlogo that I want to put out there.\n\n291\n00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:34.780\nAnd again, I've got all those same,\n\n292\n00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:38.410\nlet me move it over to this side all\nthose same styles that I can add to it.\n\n293\n00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:43.470\nYou can do a picture frame around it,\nadd a little bit of a reflection to it.\n\n294\n00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:45.450\nWhat'd be another cool one for this?\n\n295\n00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:51.360\nMaybe we wanna do a picture effect and\nadd some reflection there.\n\n296\n00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:55.470\nSo you can see the pill bottle\nlooks like it's being reflected.\n\n297\n00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:59.460\nYou could add some glow to it,\n3D rotation.\n\n298\n00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:03.413\nI wanna rotate these guys and\nmake them look three dimensional.\n\n299\n00:16:03.413 --> 00:16:07.571\nIt's kind of tough to do with a 2-D image,\nit doesn't look all that 3-D but\n\n300\n00:16:07.571 --> 00:16:08.957\nyou get the idea, right.\n\n301\n00:16:08.957 --> 00:16:12.069\nLots of neat things you\ncan do with these images.\n\n302\n00:16:12.069 --> 00:16:16.403\nAnd maybe you've got a need for that in\nyour spreadsheet with all your data or\n\n303\n00:16:16.403 --> 00:16:19.586\nmaybe you're doing again a form\nthat you want to build or\n\n304\n00:16:19.586 --> 00:16:22.920\nmaybe you're wanting a pamphlet or\na flyer or something.\n\n305\n00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.480\nExcel, you can do that with.\n\n306\n00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:28.620\nI'll delete that one and\n\n307\n00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:32.830\nthe next thing I want to show you\nhere is we did our smart art.\n\n308\n00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:35.070\nLet's take a look at,\nthe shapes are pretty straight forward.\n\n309\n00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:38.510\nWhen I hit the shapes,\nthere's several different ones.\n\n310\n00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:43.140\nYou can just come down here, grab\na particular shape that you want to add.\n\n311\n00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:47.620\nMaybe we want to do some clouds or\nsomething.\n\n312\n00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:49.210\nI click and drag.\n\n313\n00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:49.840\nAnd there's my cloud.\n\n314\n00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:54.160\nAll right and then I got all the same\noptions, I can rotate that guy around,\n\n315\n00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:58.990\nI can resize it,\nI can change the color of the shape.\n\n316\n00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:02.480\nI wanna make a black cloud,\nthat looks pretty bad.\n\n317\n00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.420\nMaybe I wanna make it a dark blue cloud,\nright?\n\n318\n00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:09.400\nI can change that around,\nyou can change the shape outline.\n\n319\n00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.840\nI wanna make it a red\noutline on that blue cloud.\n\n320\n00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:18.575\nAgain, do not follow my examples\nas far as [LAUGH] creativity goes.\n\n321\n00:17:18.575 --> 00:17:21.633\nI can take something and\nmake it really ugly really quick.\n\n322\n00:17:21.633 --> 00:17:25.905\nAt least we have all the same shadow\noptions to make it look like it's\n\n323\n00:17:25.905 --> 00:17:27.675\npopping out of the page.\n\n324\n00:17:27.675 --> 00:17:31.445\nYou know, give it that three\ndimensional kind of feel to it there.\n\n325\n00:17:31.445 --> 00:17:33.445\nLots of neat stuff with the shapes.\n\n326\n00:17:33.445 --> 00:17:39.050\nAnd as you saw, there are several\ndifferent shapes to choose from.\n\n327\n00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:43.950\nYou know, if you need to make\na call out on a spreadsheet,\n\n328\n00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:47.620\nfor some reason, you know, put an idea for\nsomebody, or something like that,\n\n329\n00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:49.280\nyou can get really creative with this,\nright?\n\n330\n00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:55.090\nThese are the kind of things I wouldn't\nexpect in a spreadsheet kind of program.\n\n331\n00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:59.560\nOther things we can do,\nRon, is gonna be WordArt.\n\n332\n00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.740\nWe've seen WordArt already.\n\n333\n00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:05.020\nI'm gonna do one more WordArt because I\nwanna show you some of the effects that\n\n334\n00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:06.530\nyou can do with that.\n\n335\n00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:10.460\nWordArt, again, is really not text.\n\n336\n00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:14.310\nIt's an image that we take text, and\nwe turn it into an image, basically.\n\n337\n00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:17.850\nSo if I wanna do some, I don't know,\nwe'll do something like that.\n\n338\n00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:23.630\nAnd we'll say, \"Ronnie is great.\"\n>> Hey, all right.\n\n339\n00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:26.330\n>> All right,\nI can rotate this thing around.\n\n340\n00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:32.650\nAnd I've got all types of different\nstyles that I can change that to.\n\n341\n00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:34.500\nAnd you see it changing\nas I hover over there.\n\n342\n00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:37.240\nWe'll give it a little\nmirrored look maybe.\n\n343\n00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.070\nIf we wanna put an outline on that.\n\n344\n00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:42.830\nAgain I'll do red just to make it\nstand out, not that that's pretty.\n\n345\n00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:46.350\nBut you can see that mirrored\neffect that I've got going there.\n\n346\n00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:49.720\nSo you can do whatever you\nwant with these shapes and\n\n347\n00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.930\nit's just good to know that\nExcel has these capabilities,\n\n348\n00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:58.630\nthat we can add things other than just\ndata to our spreadsheets if we want.\n\n349\n00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:02.035\nOr if we need to make that\nlogo on our purchase order.\n\n350\n00:19:02.035 --> 00:19:06.175\nI don't have to do it on another\nprogram and bring it into Excel.\n\n351\n00:19:06.175 --> 00:19:09.935\nI can do most of it right here in Excel,\nright.\n\n352\n00:19:09.935 --> 00:19:12.225\nAnd they all have properties\nthat you can modify.\n\n353\n00:19:12.225 --> 00:19:15.425\nAnything that you add,\nall you have to do is right click on it,\n\n354\n00:19:15.425 --> 00:19:20.840\nand you can typically pull up Size and\nProperties, or Format Shape,\n\n355\n00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:24.840\nand that'll give you all of the different\noptions that you can configure.\n\n356\n00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:25.650\nAnd all these styles and\n\n357\n00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:29.320\nstuff up here that I've been\nclicking on are just presets, right?\n\n358\n00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:30.370\nBut I'm not stuck with any of them.\n\n359\n00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:34.590\nI can find one that's close,\nlike this one has that reflection on it.\n\n360\n00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:36.438\nYou know me, I love that reflection there.\n\n361\n00:19:36.438 --> 00:19:40.600\nLet me right-click on this guy and\nchoose Format Text Effects.\n\n362\n00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.240\nAnd I can go to reflection.\n\n363\n00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:48.610\nAnd I like that reflection so much,\nI want to increase it just a little bit.\n\n364\n00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:50.150\nWe're gonna go make that bigger, right?\n\n365\n00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:52.530\nSo now I can almost see\nthe whole word there.\n\n366\n00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:56.810\nAll right?\nBut I can increase that reflection.\n\n367\n00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:59.680\nI wanna do some 3D rotation with this.\n\n368\n00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.090\nWell, the style I picked is not 3D.\n\n369\n00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:05.980\nAlright that's another style up there, I\ncan take this style because I like it and\n\n370\n00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.210\nadd some 3-D rotation to it.\n\n371\n00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:11.360\nI'm gonna start spending that thing\naround, twisting it around, or\n\n372\n00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:14.010\ndoing whatever it is\nthat I want to with it.\n\n373\n00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:16.490\nSo you're limited by your own creativity.\n\n374\n00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:19.640\nThe tools are there within Excel,\nyou just take that shape, you\n\n375\n00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:24.700\npull up its properties and you can change\njust about any aspect of that object.\n\n376\n00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:28.480\n>> There's no doubt Mike that I do see the\nvalue of this especially in things like\n\n377\n00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.410\nyou were talking about\nin the purchase order.\n\n378\n00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:34.350\nWhere it's maybe an invoice that you\nactually want to end up creating.\n\n379\n00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:38.095\nAnd when you think about it right, a lot\nof times we might have actually thought\n\n380\n00:20:38.095 --> 00:20:41.839\nwell, we'll do all the formulas in Excel\nbut if I really wanted to enhance it,\n\n381\n00:20:41.839 -->
