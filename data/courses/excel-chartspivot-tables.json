another great\nepisode of OfficeProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.377 --> 00:00:18.741\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:18.741 --> 00:00:20.427\nAnd in today's episode, well,\n\n6\n00:00:20.427 --> 00:00:23.691\nwe are starting our new series on\nExcel charts and pivot tables.\n\n7\n00:00:23.691 --> 00:00:27.405\nAnd guess, what joining us in the studio\nis our resident expert on that very topic.\n\n8\n00:00:27.405 --> 00:00:29.540\nOur good friend, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.722\nVonne, we're glad to have\nyou in this new series.\n\n10\n00:00:30.722 --> 00:00:31.950\nIt's gonna be a lot of fun.\n\n11\n00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.393\nHow it's going today?\n\n12\n00:00:33.393 --> 00:00:36.136\n&gt;&gt; It's a great day Here at ITProTV.\n\n13\n00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:38.300\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We do have fun here, don't we?\n\n14\n00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.960\n&gt;&gt; Yes, wait, we're OfficeProTv.\n\n15\n00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:39.777\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n16\n00:00:39.777 --> 00:00:40.490\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n17\n00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:41.503\n&gt;&gt; Same thing.\n&gt;&gt; Well, we've got this here.\n\n18\n00:00:41.503 --> 00:00:42.123\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're all [INAUDIBLE].\n\n19\n00:00:42.123 --> 00:00:44.582\n&gt;&gt; It's all one big family.\n\n20\n00:00:44.582 --> 00:00:47.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, and\nwe're exploring the family of charts and\n\n21\n00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.310\npivot tables in this series.\n\n22\n00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.152\nThis is our first in the series\nthat we're gonna start off with,\n\n23\n00:00:53.152 --> 00:00:55.725\njust some basic foundational knowledge.\n\n24\n00:00:55.725 --> 00:01:00.190\nBecause we really wanna just separate\nout the charts and the pivot tables.\n\n25\n00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.815\nBecause it seems that everybody wants\nto know how to do a pivot table.\n\n26\n00:01:02.815 --> 00:01:04.550\nIt's like, just make a pivot table.\n\n27\n00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.500\nAnd it's like, my gosh,\nit's the scariest thing in the world.\n\n28\n00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.341\nAnd it's actually not that bad,\nonce you break it down.\n\n29\n00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:11.380\nSame with the charts.\n\n30\n00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.007\nIf you really kinda just like,\nlet's talk about the terminology first.\n\n31\n00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:16.807\nWhat is a series?\n\n32\n00:01:16.807 --> 00:01:17.855\nWhat is an axis?\n\n33\n00:01:17.855 --> 00:01:20.562\nWhat is a value label thing?\n\n34\n00:01:20.562 --> 00:01:22.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Hey, guess what?\n\n35\n00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.507\nWe have a PowerPoint, so\nI know what we're talking about, so.\n\n36\n00:01:24.507 --> 00:01:25.406\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n37\n00:01:25.406 --> 00:01:26.950\nI think it's funny you\nbring up the terminology.\n\n38\n00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.240\nI think that is probably\nthe very beginning of the,\n\n39\n00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.850\nyou start getting heart palpitations and\nhesitations about doing Excel.\n\n40\n00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.790\nBecause it's got some strange terminology.\n\n41\n00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.690\nPivot table,\nthat just sounds like math to me.\n\n42\n00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.540\nAnd that makes me have anxiety attacks.\n\n43\n00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's one of those,\nokay, we need a report.\n\n44\n00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.310\nYou need to generate this now,\nand it's like, what?\n\n45\n00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.854\nAnd so it's a lot of, well,\nI know what I would need it to look like.\n\n46\n00:01:54.854 --> 00:01:58.150\nChart needs to look like this, but\nI can't make the numbers do it.\n\n47\n00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.900\nAnd that can be a little\nbit of a struggle.\n\n48\n00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.866\nNow, of course, we're gonna have\nperfect demonstration, where, look,\n\n49\n00:02:02.866 --> 00:02:04.030\neverything works perfectly!\n\n50\n00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.223\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; And in the real world,\n\n51\n00:02:06.223 --> 00:02:10.615\nit really also comes down to,\nis your data set up properly\n\n52\n00:02:10.615 --> 00:02:15.479\nto be able to show the report that\nyour boss wanted two days ago?\n\n53\n00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:18.185\nAnd you're just like,\nI don't know how to do a chart so.\n\n54\n00:02:18.185 --> 00:02:19.239\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna try and\n\n55\n00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.821\njust start from the very beginning.\n\n56\n00:02:20.821 --> 00:02:25.715\nThis is why we have our introduction to\ncharts in the particular topic of this\n\n57\n00:02:25.715 --> 00:02:26.570\nseries.\n\n58\n00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.441\nAnd so we're gonna just start\ngetting familiar with this.\n\n59\n00:02:28.441 --> 00:02:30.640\nSo I do have a PowerPoint ready to go.\n\n60\n00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.239\nIt's called Parts of a Chart, and\n\n61\n00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.447\nthis is something that I've actually\nused in a couple other series.\n\n62\n00:02:35.447 --> 00:02:39.232\nSo if it looks familiar,\nyou've seen it before.\n\n63\n00:02:39.232 --> 00:02:42.905\nSo now this is where, in this particular\nslideshow we're talking about, okay,\n\n64\n00:02:42.905 --> 00:02:45.180\nwell, we could have\na table of information.\n\n65\n00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.920\nNow, of course, in Excel\neverything's in a table, in a sense.\n\n66\n00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.520\nWhat I mean by table is we have\neverything in columns and in rows.\n\n67\n00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.220\nIt is a spreadsheet application,\nto clarify that formatting as a table.\n\n68\n00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.190\nTables in Excel are a little different.\n\n69\n00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.250\nBut if we're using the generic\nterminology, that's what we've got.\n\n70\n00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.580\nSo if we could see, all right, well, it\nlooks like definitely Bishop sleeps more\n\n71\n00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.000\nthan Fuego, and\nthey both seem to play a decent amount.\n\n72\n00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.890\nBut it looks like Bishop's\ngot him won there and\n\n73\n00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.210\nFuego definitely likes to\nmeow more than Bishop.\n\n74\n00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.217\nI'm looking at that.\n\n75\n00:03:18.217 --> 00:03:21.641\nBut wouldn't it be a lot easier\nif we had some graphical\n\n76\n00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:25.737\nrepresentation of our data to say,\nwow, well, then yeah,\n\n77\n00:03:25.737 --> 00:03:29.400\nthe orange bar is much bigger\nthan the blue bar right here?\n\n78\n00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.042\nAnd then which one is the orange?\n\n79\n00:03:31.042 --> 00:03:32.673\nOrange is Bishop, so\n\n80\n00:03:32.673 --> 00:03:37.491\na chart is really just a graphical\nrepresentation of our data.\n\n81\n00:03:37.491 --> 00:03:38.962\nJust like we have have smart art,\n\n82\n00:03:38.962 --> 00:03:41.655\nwhich is a graphical representation\nof our data right here.\n\n83\n00:03:41.655 --> 00:03:44.525\nSo we can visually see what\n\n84\n00:03:44.525 --> 00:03:48.085\nour information is trying\nto tell us right here.\n\n85\n00:03:48.085 --> 00:03:51.855\nSo this is where we have,\nthis is a clustered column chart, and\n\n86\n00:03:51.855 --> 00:03:55.295\nthen you can see that we have\nour series labels on there.\n\n87\n00:03:55.295 --> 00:03:58.544\nWe also have our different value axis and\nwe have our legend.\n\n88\n00:03:58.544 --> 00:04:03.540\nSee, I'm already using that terminology\nif a chart right from the very beginning.\n\n89\n00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.700\nBut what is this doing?\n\n90\n00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.075\nIt is comparing the hours, or\nreally we're comparing Fuego and Bishop to\n\n91\n00:04:10.075 --> 00:04:15.900\neach other in each category of sleeping,\nand eating, playing, and meowing.\n\n92\n00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.320\nSo you could see that along the bottom.\n\n93\n00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.840\nAnd how are we measuring this?\n\n94\n00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.490\nWell, it says hours right over\nthere on the left-hand side and\n\n95\n00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.430\nwe have something at the top that says,\nActivities Hours a Day.\n\n96\n00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.385\nSo all of these things are just going to\nkinda help explain what this information,\n\n97\n00:04:33.385 --> 00:04:36.380\nwell, what we're actually looking at.\n\n98\n00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.107\nSo let's jump into some of that\nterminology that we're going to be using\n\n99\n00:04:40.107 --> 00:04:44.031\nwithin Excel, and really what Excel is\ngoing to be forcing us to use in this.\n\n100\n00:04:44.031 --> 00:04:48.813\nEverywhere where you see the orange,\nthat is known as a data series.\n\n101\n00:04:48.813 --> 00:04:54.240\nIt's a series of information that\nhas different points along the way.\n\n102\n00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.060\nThe 12 hours of sleep that\nBishop does is a point.\n\n103\n00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.860\nThe three hours that he eats,\nthat is in point.\n\n104\n00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.255\nAnd you can see that we're trying to\ncorrelate where that works within this\n\n105\n00:05:05.255 --> 00:05:06.448\ntabular data with.\n\n106\n00:05:06.448 --> 00:05:10.420\nThis is more within PowerPoint.\n\n107\n00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.449\nBut you'll see it when we see\nthe example in Excel, that that column,\n\n108\n00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:18.428\nBishop is a column, Fuego is a column and\nthe activities is a column.\n\n109\n00:05:18.428 --> 00:05:21.187\nAnd in the rows, you have the sleeping and\nthe eating, and so\n\n110\n00:05:21.187 --> 00:05:23.800\nthat's where you have the rows\ngoing across the bottom.\n\n111\n00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.360\nAnd the columns are the different, well,\nin this sense, columns of the chart.\n\n112\n00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.480\nSo we have our value,\naccess, and category access,\n\n113\n00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.250\nbecause those are the categories\nof what we're comparing.\n\n114\n00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.190\nThe sleeping and\nthe eating of Fuego and Bishop, so\n\n115\n00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.050\nthat's what we need to\nhave across the top.\n\n116\n00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.720\nBecause we are working on an x and\na y-axis,\n\n117\n00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.360\nor what they're saying is category\non the bottom, value on the left.\n\n118\n00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.030\nLet's see what's on the next slide, and\nthen all sorts of parts of your chart.\n\n119\n00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.478\nYou have the chart's title, well,\nthat's pretty self-explanatory.\n\n120\n00:06:03.478 --> 00:06:04.688\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's the thing up at the top.\n\n121\n00:06:04.688 --> 00:06:05.766\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n122\n00:06:05.766 --> 00:06:08.395\ntell me more about this\ntitle of which you speak.\n\n123\n00:06:08.395 --> 00:06:11.030\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the title is the title.\n\n124\n00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.685\n&gt;&gt; It's at the top.\n\n125\n00:06:11.685 --> 00:06:12.475\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n126\n00:06:12.475 --> 00:06:14.547\n&gt;&gt; About the thing you're looking at.\n\n127\n00:06:14.547 --> 00:06:16.734\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, yeah, so\n\n128\n00:06:16.734 --> 00:06:18.720\nwe have the title, the legend.\n\n129\n00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.360\nWhat does blue represent?\n\n130\n00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.250\nWhat does orange represent?\n\n131\n00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.440\nAnd that's what I'm looking at.\n\n132\n00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.580\nAnd then, of course, we have an axis\ntitle that this is the activity and\n\n133\n00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.130\nthe axis title here, where we have it.\n\n134\n00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.130\nAnd I'm just kind of emphasizing\nthat the data series,\n\n135\n00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:39.150\nthe grid lines, and all of this is,\nwe're plotting this chart.\n\n136\n00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.423\nSo, this is the plot\narea all around in here,\n\n137\n00:06:42.423 --> 00:06:45.361\nwhich is different than the chart area.\n\n138\n00:06:45.361 --> 00:06:48.581\nThe whole box that everything lives, and\n\n139\n00:06:48.581 --> 00:06:52.450\nall of these are selectable\nitems within a chart.\n\n140\n00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:58.407\nAnd so, knowing what you want to format,\nwell, you gotta know where to click and\n\n141\n00:06:58.407 --> 00:06:59.932\nwhat you want selected.\n\n142\n00:06:59.932 --> 00:07:04.861\nSo we have some nice references\nright here to that terminology.\n\n143\n00:07:04.861 --> 00:07:09.384\nThe thing on the bottom, and I've seen\nthese types of things, I've seen charts\n\n144\n00:07:09.384 --> 00:07:13.724\nthat have this, well, table at the bottom\nthat gives you that information.\n\n145\n00:07:13.724 --> 00:07:14.940\nThis is known as a data table.\n\n146\n00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.704\nBecause while the bars will go ahead and\n\n147\n00:07:17.704 --> 00:07:22.320\nrepresent, I can easily see that\nBishop sleeps more than Fuego.\n\n148\n00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:29.859\nAnd these are all whole numbers, but\nwhat if this was 12.8256 and 8.2584?\n\n149\n00:07:29.859 --> 00:07:35.386\nThat's where you might need to see\nthat information in its entirety,\n\n150\n00:07:35.386 --> 00:07:40.550\nso you can add a data table to make\na little bit more sense out of it.\n\n151\n00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.340\nBut then you could also switch this.\n\n152\n00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:48.403\nNow, this is just another way that\nwe could interpret this data.\n\n153\n00:07:48.403 --> 00:07:53.411\nInstead of in one category\nwe're comparing the sleeping,\n\n154\n00:07:53.411 --> 00:07:57.228\neating and playing,\nnow we have it as Fuego.\n\n155\n00:07:57.228 --> 00:08:01.643\nAnd all the things we're comparing is\nthe amount of sleep, eat, play and meow.\n\n156\n00:08:01.643 --> 00:08:04.905\nSo you could see that it's just It's\nreally just take the information and\n\n157\n00:08:04.905 --> 00:08:06.654\njust flipping it on it's side, okay?\n\n158\n00:08:06.654 --> 00:08:11.632\nSo now you can kind of compare\nCats as the category rather than\n\n159\n00:08:11.632 --> 00:08:14.180\nthe Activity as the category.\n\n160\n00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.696\nAnd I probably should've\nchanged that label right here,\n\n161\n00:08:16.696 --> 00:08:18.710\nthat it's not really\nthat activity anymore.\n\n162\n00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:21.480\nIt would be Cats, so [LAUGH].\n\n163\n00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.961\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But, that's okay.\n\n164\n00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:25.701\nWe'll pretend that didn't happen [LAUGH].\n\n165\n00:08:25.701 --> 00:08:30.130\nWe'll have the line graphs, cuz there's\nall sorts of different types of charts.\n\n166\n00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:31.857\nWe have our clustered column here.\n\n167\n00:08:31.857 --> 00:08:34.830\nAnd then we have a line graph.\n\n168\n00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.870\nGraph and charts,\nthose are kinda used interchangeably.\n\n169\n00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:39.430\nWe don't really call it a line chart.\n\n170\n00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:41.200\nAt least that's not how\nI remember doing this.\n\n171\n00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.070\nCuz I remember having to do this\nin school and put the little dots.\n\n172\n00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:46.526\nAnd then draw all the lines like that.\n\n173\n00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:49.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think they just called it\na line graph where I went to school.\n\n174\n00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:49.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n175\n00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:50.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, graph, chart.\n\n176\n00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:51.506\n&gt;&gt; Chart, same thing.\n\n177\n00:08:51.506 --> 00:08:52.554\n&gt;&gt; Same thing.\n&gt;&gt; Six of one.\n\n178\n00:08:52.554 --> 00:08:54.514\n&gt;&gt; Half dozen or the other\n&gt;&gt; Some other.\n\n179\n00:08:54.514 --> 00:08:55.323\n&gt;&gt; Did I say it right?\n\n180\n00:08:55.323 --> 00:08:55.937\n&gt;&gt; You did, actually [LAUGH].\n\n181\n00:08:55.937 --> 00:08:56.858\n&gt;&gt; Yes [LAUGH]!\n\n182\n00:08:56.858 --> 00:08:58.297\n&gt;&gt; So proud of you.\n\n183\n00:08:58.297 --> 00:08:58.897\n&gt;&gt; Score [LAUGH]!\n\n184\n00:08:58.897 --> 00:09:02.658\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we have different ways,\n\n185\n00:09:02.658 --> 00:09:04.509\nand this has specific style.\n\n186\n00:09:04.509 --> 00:09:09.442\nWe've talked a lot about formatting\ngraphable elements with styles\n\n187\n00:09:09.442 --> 00:09:11.660\nin our Excel advanced series.\n\n188\n00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:16.026\nSo all the same things that you can do\nwith a shape or an image where you can,\n\n189\n00:09:16.026 --> 00:09:18.293\nwell I guess we'll stay with shapes.\n\n190\n00:09:18.293 --> 00:09:22.760\nFills, outlines, the effect where you\ncan put drop shadows, you can put glows.\n\n191\n00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.730\nYou can make anything 3D.\n\n192\n00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:28.020\nAll of that applies,\nbecause this is a graphical element.\n\n193\n00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:33.150\nThis is a piece of art, if we'll call it,\nto go ahead and show the information.\n\n194\n00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:36.739\nThen here's another type of chart\nthat we see a lot of times.\n\n195\n00:09:36.739 --> 00:09:40.080\nThis would be a pie chart, or a pie graph.\n\n196\n00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.526\nAnd this does have some\nstyles applied to it.\n\n197\n00:09:42.526 --> 00:09:44.440\nYou still have a legend.\n\n198\n00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:49.736\nBut when this time what we're doing is\nyou're really only comparing one series,\n\n199\n00:09:49.736 --> 00:09:54.659\none category, that Fuego, where you\ndon't have Fuego and Bishop in here.\n\n200\n00:09:54.659 --> 00:10:00.440\nSo pie charts is just one\nthing that has pieces of it.\n\n201\n00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.664\nSo you could see that we're\nlooking at the activity here.\n\n202\n00:10:02.664 --> 00:10:07.560\nAnd I also have some data labels on\nhere of what is the actual value.\n\n203\n00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.960\nAnd then what percentage\nof the whole that is.\n\n204\n00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:12.700\nAnd guess what?\n\n205\n00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.010\nI didn't calculate that.\n\n206\n00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.191\nI didn't do any of that math.\n\n207\n00:10:15.191 --> 00:10:16.486\nLuckily, Excel does it for me.\n\n208\n00:10:16.486 --> 00:10:19.556\nAll I have to do is check off a little\ncheck box of Use Percentages.\n\n209\n00:10:19.556 --> 00:10:21.360\nLike, yes, no math [LAUGH].\n\n210\n00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.252\nAnd then of course we have\nan exploding pie right here.\n\n211\n00:10:25.252 --> 00:10:28.596\nThat's what it's actually\ncalled the amount of explosion.\n\n212\n00:10:28.596 --> 00:10:30.710\nAnd one little piece right here.\n\n213\n00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:34.570\nAnd so we can see different ways\nthat we can take our data labels.\n\n214\n00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:38.798\nInstead of having them here in\nthe middle with a specific style,\n\n215\n00:10:38.798 --> 00:10:40.688\nwe have them on the outside.\n\n216\n00:10:40.688 --> 00:10:42.658\nAnd then there's also changes\nwhere the legend goes.\n\n217\n00:10:42.658 --> 00:10:47.400\nSo you can see that you can start moving\naround these different components.\n\n218\n00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:51.457\nBut again, knowing that these things\nout here are known as data labels.\n\n219\n00:10:51.457 --> 00:10:53.498\nAnd knowing that this thing\ndown here is a legend.\n\n220\n00:10:53.498 --> 00:10:55.996\nAnd you're just kinda\ngetting that terminology,\n\n221\n00:10:55.996 --> 00:10:58.480\nis going to be really important.\n\n222\n00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.652\nNow the nice thing is that you gonna\nhave a lot of help along the way,\n\n223\n00:11:01.652 --> 00:11:04.614\nwhen you start inserting charts and\nyou start formatting it.\n\n224\n00:11:04.614 --> 00:11:08.976\nAnd we're gonna take a look at finish\nchart in just a second, within Excel,\n\n225\n00:11:08.976 --> 00:11:11.010\nnot just in PowerPoint here.\n\n226\n00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:13.460\nBut I always like to end on, whoo whoo.\n\n227\n00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:15.526\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n228\n00:11:15.526 --> 00:11:18.186\n&gt;&gt; That is a special, special\nbackground you have going on there.\n\n229\n00:11:18.186 --> 00:11:19.894\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, right.\n\n230\n00:11:19.894 --> 00:11:21.122\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The slide changed, and\n\n231\n00:11:21.122 --> 00:11:21.656\nhe went like, whoa!\n\n232\n00:11:21.656 --> 00:11:22.671\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n233\n00:11:22.671 --> 00:11:25.131\n&gt;&gt; And this is to prove a point of well,\n\n234\n00:11:25.131 --> 00:11:30.625\nwhile you have the capability of putting\na picture of Bishop in the background of\n\n235\n00:11:30.625 --> 00:11:35.636\nyour plot area, making some bubbled\ntextures within your data series-\n\n236\n00:11:35.636 --> 00:11:36.947\n&gt;&gt; It may be ill-advised.\n\n237\n00:11:36.947 --> 00:11:38.618\nThat's what I think you're\ntrying to tell us [LAUGH].\n\n238\n00:11:38.618 --> 00:11:43.292\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the whole idea here is to have\na graphical representation of your data.\n\n239\n00:11:43.292 --> 00:11:47.516\nAnd not have people go, I have no\nidea what I'm looking at [LAUGH].\n\n240\n00:11:47.516 --> 00:11:54.966\nYeah, so something more along like this,\nthat was a little clearer information.\n\n241\n00:11:54.966 --> 00:11:57.430\nThat's what we want to\nget the point across.\n\n242\n00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:00.590\nBut I will show you that\nyou can add patterns, and\n\n243\n00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:04.660\ntextures, and gradients, and different\ncolors all over the place, if you want to,\n\n244\n00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.409\nof formatting theses elements.\n\n245\n00:12:06.409 --> 00:12:09.770\nCuz, if you really think about it,\nthis is, it's just a rectangle.\n\n246\n00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:11.850\nYeah, this is a rectangle,\nthat's just a line.\n\n247\n00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:16.671\nThese are graphical elements, and\nof course the data's attached to it.\n\n248\n00:12:16.671 --> 00:12:20.355\nSo just know that even if you can,\nyou might not want to [LAUGH].\n\n249\n00:12:20.355 --> 00:12:21.475\nAll right.\n\n250\n00:12:21.475 --> 00:12:23.203\n&gt;&gt; Just cuz you can doesn't\nmean you should, right Vonne?\n\n251\n00:12:23.203 --> 00:12:24.211\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n252\n00:12:24.211 --> 00:12:28.189\nSo I have an example file\nthat we will look at.\n\n253\n00:12:28.189 --> 00:12:33.000\nAgain, just getting our feet under us and\njust getting familiar with it.\n\n254\n00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.800\nWe're not talking about how\nto insert the chart just yet.\n\n255\n00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.780\nAnd we're not gonna do\nany crazy formattings.\n\n256\n00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:41.990\nIt's really more of,\nokay, so I have a chart.\n\n257\n00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:44.950\nIf I select it, what happens?\n\n258\n00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:48.904\nJust like if I was selecting an image or\nsome type of shape,\n\n259\n00:12:48.904 --> 00:12:52.794\nyou are going to have your\ncontextual tabs up at the tart.\n\n260\n00:12:52.794 --> 00:12:53.337\nAt the tart?\n\n261\n00:12:53.337 --> 00:12:54.835\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Is that what I just said [LAUGH]?\n\n262\n00:12:54.835 --> 00:12:56.121\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it looks like a tart [LAUGH].\n\n263\n00:12:56.121 --> 00:13:00.204\n&gt;&gt; I think I was trying to combine top-\n&gt;&gt; Raspberry or blueberry, maybe?\n\n264\n00:13:00.204 --> 00:13:01.383\n&gt;&gt; Mm, that sounds yummy.\n\n265\n00:13:01.383 --> 00:13:02.431\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n&gt;&gt; I'll have that.\n\n266\n00:13:02.431 --> 00:13:03.874\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n267\n00:13:03.874 --> 00:13:08.340\n&gt;&gt; So [LAUGH] we have the top of\nour ribbon with our chart tools.\n\n268\n00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:11.846\nThat's what I was trying to say,\nit just kind of blended together.\n\n269\n00:13:11.846 --> 00:13:13.780\nWe have a design tab.\n\n270\n00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:18.463\nAnd on this design tab you have\nthe different things that would be more\n\n271\n00:13:18.463 --> 00:13:22.108\nassociated with the design\nof the particular chart.\n\n272\n00:13:22.108 --> 00:13:26.921\nAll of those elements that we were just\ntalking about, like the data labels,\n\n273\n00:13:26.921 --> 00:13:29.750\nthe chart title,\nyou can add them into here.\n\n274\n00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:31.830\nNow notice, some of them are grayed out.\n\n275\n00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:32.800\nAnd that could be,\n\n276\n00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:37.350\nwell I know it is because of the type\nof the chart that we have created here.\n\n277\n00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:41.636\nThis is a pie chart, and so\nthere aren't going to be as many options.\n\n278\n00:13:41.636 --> 00:13:44.926\nLike we can't really put in lines here or\ntrend lines,\n\n279\n00:13:44.926 --> 00:13:49.450\nbecause that's not applicable within\nthis particular type of chart.\n\n280\n00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:53.211\nBut where we put the legend, that's part\nof it, so I could go ahead and see that.\n\n281\n00:13:53.211 --> 00:13:55.432\nAnd let me just scroll\ndown just a little bit so\n\n282\n00:13:55.432 --> 00:13:59.610\nyou can see that the legend is right here,\nso I can go ahead and move it around.\n\n283\n00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:02.690\nRemember I said that it'll help\nyou out a lot along the way.\n\n284\n00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:06.568\nI mean, these are some good\ngraphics right here that say,\n\n285\n00:14:06.568 --> 00:14:09.287\nthe right means it's\ngonna go to the right.\n\n286\n00:14:09.287 --> 00:14:11.127\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hey, imagine that [LAUGH]?\n\n287\n00:14:11.127 --> 00:14:12.647\nSo, and then the left and the bottom.\n\n288\n00:14:12.647 --> 00:14:15.868\nAnd so you also have that\nhover in the live previewing,\n\n289\n00:14:15.868 --> 00:14:17.770\nthat's the hover to discover.\n\n290\n00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:18.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's always nice, right?\n\n291\n00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.404\nThe live preview stuff is where,\nwell, I don't know,\n\n292\n00:14:21.404 --> 00:14:24.531\ncuz back in the day what you had to do,\nyou had to click on it, look at it.\n\n293\n00:14:24.531 --> 00:14:26.565\nAnd go, okay, maybe I like that.\n\n294\n00:14:26.565 --> 00:14:29.000\nCtrl+Z that, go back, do it again.\n\n295\n00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.190\nOkay, look at that.\n\n296\n00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:32.100\nOkay, well hold on,\nhow'd this look, right?\n\n297\n00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:33.500\nIt's a real pain in the butt process.\n\n298\n00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:34.616\nThis makes it easy.\n\n299\n00:14:34.616 --> 00:14:36.248\nYou just hover over it,\nand then you watch it go.\n\n300\n00:14:36.248 --> 00:14:37.014\nThat's nice.\n\n301\n00:14:37.014 --> 00:14:38.186\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that is.\n\n302\n00:14:38.186 --> 00:14:41.984\nAnd once you get the information\nin the chart right,\n\n303\n00:14:41.984 --> 00:14:46.610\nall of the rest of it is gonna, hopefully-\n&gt;&gt; Right, just style, personal preference.\n\n304\n00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:49.002\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it makes it a little easier,\n\n305\n00:14:49.002 --> 00:14:51.914\ncuz they have really beefed\nthis stuff up a lot.\n\n306\n00:14:51.914 --> 00:14:53.948\nAnd then the data labels, now that I know.\n\n307\n00:14:53.948 --> 00:14:57.507\nEven if I didn't know the terminology\nof what is a data label,\n\n308\n00:14:57.507 --> 00:15:01.430\nit shows you those things that\nare gonna be inside, [LAUGH] outside.\n\n309\n00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:02.855\nAnd the hovering, it's a little.\n\n310\n00:15:05.031 --> 00:15:05.823\nWell here, you know what?\n\n311\n00:15:05.823 --> 00:15:06.831\nI'm gonna just take the, whoo, hello!\n\n312\n00:15:06.831 --> 00:15:07.521\n&gt;&gt; No, you're not [LAUGH].\n\n313\n00:15:07.521 --> 00:15:08.263\n&gt;&gt; The Ctrl-Z [LAUGH].\n\n314\n00:15:08.263 --> 00:15:12.771\nI'll just move this over here so you can\nsee when I start adding those different\n\n315\n00:15:12.771 --> 00:15:15.240\nlabels it's going to preview them for me.\n\n316\n00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.920\nThey're a little small right now.\n\n317\n00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.054\nBut that's nice that you\ncould see the difference.\n\n318\n00:15:19.054 --> 00:15:19.966\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty good.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n319\n00:15:19.966 --> 00:15:20.638\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n\n320\n00:15:20.638 --> 00:15:22.768\n&gt;&gt; Right, that was pretty easy,\nwasn't it, yeah [LAUGH]?\n\n321\n00:15:22.768 --> 00:15:23.303\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, super.\n\n322\n00:15:23.303 --> 00:15:27.239\nSo adding the different chart\nelements will help you along here.\n\n323\n00:15:27.239 --> 00:15:30.055\nLet's go ahead and\nselect this one over here.\n\n324\n00:15:30.055 --> 00:15:33.589\nYou also have different ways that\nyou can do your layouts, okay?\n\n325\n00:15:33.589 --> 00:15:35.511\nA lot of pre built stuff.\n\n326\n00:15:35.511 --> 00:15:37.421\nIt's kinda like with the smart art.\n\n327\n00:15:37.421 --> 00:15:40.359\nRemember, once we get it in there,\nyou just go ahead a throw style on it.\n\n328\n00:15:40.359 --> 00:15:42.110\nAnd it's like, you're done, right?\n\n329\n00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:46.371\nSo and this gives me lots of different\noptions and presets if how it can have\n\n330\n00:15:46.371 --> 00:15:49.961\ncertain amount of elements\ncombined into a specific layout.\n\n331\n00:15:49.961 --> 00:15:52.760\nAnd then I can quickly choose that.\n\n332\n00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.570\nWe have our change colors,\nthat's pretty self-explanatory.\n\n333\n00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:58.077\nWhat is this pulling off of?\nIt's pulling off of the theme.\n\n334\n00:15:58.077 --> 00:16:01.140\nI went ahead and picked a theme that\nhad some pinks and purples in it.\n\n335\n00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:02.021\nImagine that.\n\n336\n00:16:02.021 --> 00:16:04.717\nAnd so you can go ahead and change that.\n\n337\n00:16:04.717 --> 00:16:07.950\nAnd then you have your\noverall chart styles to where\n\n338\n00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:12.020\nit's going to format each one\nof these elements individually.\n\n339\n00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.650\nWell, actually not individually,\nthey have the different ones.\n\n340\n00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:18.220\nAnd then it's all part of a group and\nit is a style.\n\n341\n00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:19.038\nSo we can look at that.\n\n342\n00:16:19.038 --> 00:16:22.820\nThat switching, remember we talked\nabout how we were comparing instead\n\n343\n00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:26.950\nof the different categories down at\nthe bottom, we flipped that around.\n\n344\n00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:27.980\nDepending on the chart,\n\n345\n00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:31.630\nit's just a one quick little button\nwhere it just goes ahead and flips.\n\n346\n00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:34.350\nYou would also change the chart type,\nthen you can move it over and\n\n347\n00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:35.620\nyou can also select the data.\n\n348\n00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:44.790\nNow the other thing to watch while I am\non my chart is what's being selected.\n\n349\n00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:49.200\nBecause the Design tab, this is kinda\nlike an all encompassing type of thing,\n\n350\n00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.210\nit's gonna format the entire chart.\n\n351\n00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:56.270\nBut when we're getting over into\nthis Format tab over here, this\n\n352\n00:16:56.270 --> 00:17:01.150\nis where it can start getting a little\nspecific as to what do I have selected.\n\n353\n00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:06.145\nSo, all those things that I told you about\nin a chart where you have a plot area,\n\n354\n00:17:06.145 --> 00:17:10.386\nyou have the grid lines,\nit's all about what you have selected and\n\n355\n00:17:10.386 --> 00:17:14.268\nthat's really anything it's\nnot just particular charts.\n\n356\n00:17:14.268 --> 00:17:17.480\nBut watch when I hover\nover different areas.\n\n357\n00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:22.090\nYou see I hover over and it gives me\nthat tooltip that says plot area.\n\n358\n00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:25.480\nI hover over here, that's my series.\n\n359\n00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.015\nWhat series is it?\n\n360\n00:17:26.015 --> 00:17:27.112\nIt's the Fuego series.\n\n361\n00:17:27.112 --> 00:17:28.488\nWhat point is this?\n\n362\n00:17:28.488 --> 00:17:31.103\nThis is the Eat, that's where I have.\n\n363\n00:17:31.103 --> 00:17:33.290\nAnd my value is 10.\n\n364\n00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:37.052\nLet me scooch on over here and\nlet's move this over a little bit so\n\n365\n00:17:37.052 --> 00:17:39.083\nyou can kinda see it all together.\n\n366\n00:17:39.083 --> 00:17:39.878\nWhoops, hello.\n\n367\n00:17:39.878 --> 00:17:42.520\nLet's move this way over there.\n\n368\n00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:43.680\nWell, nop.\n&gt;&gt; No you're not.\n\n369\n00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:44.610\n&gt;&gt; No we're not, how about we do this?\n\n370\n00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:45.948\nI will scroll down.\n\n371\n00:17:45.948 --> 00:17:46.448\n&gt;&gt; You push it to the back.\n\n372\n00:17:46.448 --> 00:17:48.089\n&gt;&gt; There we go, okay, there.\n\n373\n00:17:48.089 --> 00:17:50.730\nSo we can see it a little closer together.\n\n374\n00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:56.120\nSo when I have this selected,\nif I click on that series,\n\n375\n00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:00.180\nnotice over here in the chart you see how\nyou have some different kinda colored\n\n376\n00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:05.050\nboxes that happen to give you\nan indication that this is the Bishop.\n\n377\n00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:09.110\nSo, again, it's trying to pull it together\nfor you, to know that, okay, well,\n\n378\n00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:12.651\nthen that's that series, if I select this,\nthat's the Fuego series.\n\n379\n00:18:12.651 --> 00:18:16.490\nAnd I also know that I have\nthe entire series selected,\n\n380\n00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:19.333\nbecause I see one, two, three, four.\n\n381\n00:18:19.333 --> 00:18:24.211\nI can see the dots on each one\nof those columns as opposed\n\n382\n00:18:24.211 --> 00:18:27.090\nto selecting this series.\n\n383\n00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:30.820\nIf I hover here and click,\nthat is the plot area.\n\n384\n00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:35.010\nOr if I hover right there,\nthere is my grid line and I click it and\n\n385\n00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:36.700\nthat selects the grid lines.\n\n386\n00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:41.330\nSo really kind of, slowing down,\npaying attention to what am I clicking on,\n\n387\n00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:42.820\nwhat am I hovering over?\n\n388\n00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:47.920\nGiving those tool tips along the way will\nreally kind of let's you know what you\n\n389\n00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:51.530\nare selecting because that's when\nyou come up in this Format tab.\n\n390\n00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:55.986\nThis is where you can start changing\nthe format of that select element.\n\n391\n00:18:55.986 --> 00:19:01.393\nSo if I came into the Fill,\nnotice that I'm changing the plot area.\n\n392\n00:19:01.393 --> 00:19:07.050\nIf I had been selected here,\nthen I would be filling in the chart area.\n\n393\n00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:11.830\nSo many different places and\nusing this Format tab will be able to\n\n394\n00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:13.970\nformat those particular elements\nthat you have selected.\n\n395\n00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:17.663\nAnd then the WordArt styles over\nhere will be how the text looks.\n\n396\n00:19:17.663 --> 00:19:21.661\nNow I have everything selected,\nif I throw this on like, okay,\n\n397\n00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:23.594\nthat's a little hard to read.\n\n398\n00:19:23.594 --> 00:19:28.539\nBut you can see that it is applying\nto everything as opposed to if I\n\n399\n00:19:28.539 --> 00:19:33.390\nhad single selected,\nthe chart title and applied it there.\n\n400\n00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:37.990\nSo just knowing where you're at,\nwhat you've clicked on, what you wanna do.\n\n401\n00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:39.920\nSlow down think about it.\n\n402\n00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:43.010\nAnd then having information that's\nbeautifully formatted such as\n\n403\n00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:45.795\nthis where everything is\nin the right columns and\n\n404\n00:19:45.795 --> 00:19:50.150\nin the right places is\npretty easy in that sense.\n\n405\n00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:52.830\nBut we'll go through some\ndifferent examples of,\n\n406\n00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:56.278\nmaybe it's not as straightforward as this.\n\n407\n00:19:56.278 --> 00:19:59.040\nAnd try and give you different examples\n\n408\n00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.960\nof how you can get your charts to\nbe able to show what you want.\n\n409\n00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:08.350\nBut again, just trying to get a foundation\nright now, just a quick introduction\n\n410\n00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:12.910\nof that terminology, where to click,\nthe different tabs up at the top.\n\n411\n00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:15.392\nAnd then what we're\ngoing to do is jump in,\n\n412\n00:20:15.392 --> 00:20:17.890\nin how to actually\ninsert this information.\n\n413\n00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:20.620\nHow we can change because\nthis is tied together.\n\n414\n00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:25.750\nSo if I change this to 15, well, it's\ngonna change in the chart as well because\n\n415\n00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:30.250\nit's saying that I'm charting\nthis particular range of cells.\n\n416\n00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:32.860\nSo making sure you have\nthe right data in there and\n\n417\n00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.588\nchanging is going to be very important.\n\n418\n00:20:34.588 --> 00:20:37.400\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne, that was a very nice\nprimer on working with charts inside\n\n419\n00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:38.240\nof Excel.\n\n420\n00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.340\nStarting to get our\nfeet wet in that arena.\n\n421\n00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.105\nit's gonna be a lot of fun as we\nmove forward cuz as you can see it\n\n422\n00:20:43.105 --> 00:20:45.250\nwas really cool,\nit gives us great graphics.\n\n423\n00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:48.480\nAnd if you are doing any type of\npresentation, this can help you out a lot\n\n424\n00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:52.165\nto make something very nice that everybody\ncan follow along with very easily.\n\n425\n00:20:52.165 --> 00:20:55.090\nVonne, I think you did a great job on this\nepisode, we do appreciate your time and\n\n426\n00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:57.060\neffort that you put into it.\n\n427\n00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:00.080\nI do appreciate our audience out there for\nwatching, but guess what?\n\n428\n00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.930\nWe have run out of time for this episode.\n\n429\n00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:05.160\nSigning off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n430\n00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.396\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n&gt;&gt; And

to another great\nepisode of Office Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.925 --> 00:00:18.563\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n5\n00:00:18.563 --> 00:00:22.943\nin today's episode we're back with more in\nour Excel charts and pivot table series.\n\n6\n00:00:22.943 --> 00:00:26.076\nIt's going to be a lot of interesting\nthings to learn in this series,\n\n7\n00:00:26.076 --> 00:00:29.802\na lot of stuff that's gonna be applicable\nto you as someone who is maybe an advanced\n\n8\n00:00:29.802 --> 00:00:30.720\nExcel user.\n\n9\n00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.050\nAnd joining us in the studio,\n\n10\n00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.500\nour resident expert on that very topic,\nour good friend, Ms. Vaughn Smith.\n\n11\n00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.630\nVaughn, welcome back to the show and\nhow's it going today?\n\n12\n00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.060\nIt's doing wonderful today.\n\n13\n00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.620\nExcellent.\n\n14\n00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.660\nWe're gonna talk all about charts,\njust like you said!\n\n15\n00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.871\nMore charts, yes.\n[LAUGH] It's kinda like, hey guess what,\n\n16\n00:00:44.871 --> 00:00:45.614\nhe already said that!\n\n17\n00:00:45.614 --> 00:00:49.508\n[LAUGH] This show happens to be about\ncharts and pivot tables so that's apropos.\n\n18\n00:00:49.508 --> 00:00:51.090\n[LAUGH] It is.\n\n19\n00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.360\nSo we had talked about some of our\nfoundational knowledge in our introduction\n\n20\n00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.970\nto charts where it explored terminology.\n\n21\n00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.100\nAnd in this episode, we are gonna keep\nit a little beginner level, in a sense.\n\n22\n00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.050\nWe're not gonna go too advanced just yet.\n\n23\n00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.870\nWe're just gonna insert a chart and\ndo some basic formattings.\n\n24\n00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.790\nAnd we're gonna keep with a,\njust a clustered column chart.\n\n25\n00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.150\nOne of the, I feel like,\nthe easier ones to kinda get our feet wet.\n\n26\n00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.510\nWe will start exploring, you know,\nwhere are the different types of charts\n\n27\n00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.360\nin there, and then maybe kind of figure\nout when we would want to use those.\n\n28\n00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.040\nBut we'd like to kind of break\nthose into different episodes.\n\n29\n00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.830\nWe'll have another episode on how to make\na pie chart and so on, and so forth.\n\n30\n00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.740\nSo you get the full knowledge of\nthat particular type of chart.\n\n31\n00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.860\nSo why don't we go ahead and\njust start right away,\n\n32\n00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.400\nlet's come down into our Excel worksheet\nthat I've called Insert and Format Chart.\n\n33\n00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.210\nAnd the one thing we did talk about in\nthe introduction to charts episode is that\n\n34\n00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.140\nif your data is perfectly\naligned like this,\n\n35\n00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.490\nthen it will be very easy to go ahead and\ninsert a chart.\n\n36\n00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.295\nAnd that's where I think,\nsometimes people kinda over complicate it.\n\n37\n00:02:02.295 --> 00:02:04.900\nTo where, hey what do I need to get?\n\n38\n00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.281\nWell, just go ahead and\nselect not just the data, but\n\n39\n00:02:10.281 --> 00:02:12.902\nif you can, pull in the values,\n\n40\n00:02:12.902 --> 00:02:18.990\nthe things that your wanting to put\non those different category axis.\n\n41\n00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.601\nAnd that way it will go ahead and\npull it all together.\n\n42\n00:02:21.601 --> 00:02:25.126\nSo I know from back in the day,\ntrying to get the charts,\n\n43\n00:02:25.126 --> 00:02:29.476\nthere is a lot more manual, they try\nto make it a lot more automatic for\n\n44\n00:02:29.476 --> 00:02:33.160\nyou now to where you just grab it and\nit just does it for you.\n\n45\n00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.860\nSo in this sense we do have\nthis formatted as a table,\n\n46\n00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.240\nthat doesn't mean you have to\nhave it formatted as a table.\n\n47\n00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.880\nBut we have some things that we\ngot the activity of Fuego and\n\n48\n00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.220\nBishop and I was going to zoom in for\nyou guys, so\n\n49\n00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.700\nyou can see this a little better and\nmy, hello, well then.\n\n50\n00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.710\nIt just really wanted to go all\nthe ways to the ends of the earth.\n\n51\n00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.020\nWe'll just go ahead and\nclick this button down here.\n\n52\n00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.608\nThat way we can zoom in\na little bit better.\n\n53\n00:02:59.608 --> 00:03:00.505\n[LAUGH] Didn't like my shortcut.\n\n54\n00:03:00.505 --> 00:03:03.069\nYeah.\n[LAUGH] That's all right.\n\n55\n00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.868\nSo I want to compare the activities,\nsleep, eat, meow and play,\n\n56\n00:03:07.868 --> 00:03:11.050\nI'd like that to be on the bottom.\n\n57\n00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.750\nAnd then Fuego and Bishop,\nI can see that those\n\n58\n00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.340\nare gonna be the columns that\nare going to go across the top.\n\n59\n00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.222\nNow, I have this word activity in here\ncuz this is like my column header.\n\n60\n00:03:20.222 --> 00:03:23.950\nDon't worry about that,\nyou're gonna grab it anyways.\n\n61\n00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.070\nSo you're gonna select everything\nwithin this area because this is\n\n62\n00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.460\nthe information I want to create a chart.\n\n63\n00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.880\nI'm not just gonna do this.\n\n64\n00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.930\nI'm not just gonna select the numbers.\n\n65\n00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.229\nBecause everything that I'm going\nto need to have as my labels,\n\n66\n00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:41.113\nthey're already there, so\njust grab the whole thing.\n\n67\n00:03:41.113 --> 00:03:45.736\nI think that's where people are a little\nlike hesitant to grab that in there.\n\n68\n00:03:45.736 --> 00:03:51.660\nGet it and then if you want to insert\na chart, we go to our insert tab.\n\n69\n00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.328\nWe come over here and\nwe have some different buttons,\n\n70\n00:03:54.328 --> 00:03:57.529\nwe have our cluster column charts,\nwe have our line charts, and\n\n71\n00:03:57.529 --> 00:03:59.988\nthen some other ones\nthat we'll explore later.\n\n72\n00:03:59.988 --> 00:04:05.185\nBut maybe you're like, I don't know which\ntype of chart I want to put in here.\n\n73\n00:04:05.185 --> 00:04:07.745\nIt's nice that they have this\ncute little recommended charts.\n\n74\n00:04:07.745 --> 00:04:09.565\nThat whole, let me be smart for you,\n\n75\n00:04:09.565 --> 00:04:13.665\nlet me give you some suggestions on\nwhat you might want to do with this.\n\n76\n00:04:13.665 --> 00:04:16.665\nNow Vaughn, is that an actual\nsuggestion based off of the data that\n\n77\n00:04:16.665 --> 00:04:17.412\nyou're feeding it?\n\n78\n00:04:17.412 --> 00:04:21.272\nOr is it like, these are the most\ncommonly used charts and\n\n79\n00:04:21.272 --> 00:04:23.152\nthat's going to be our list\nof recommended charts?\n\n80\n00:04:23.152 --> 00:04:24.382\nIt will look at your data.\n\n81\n00:04:24.382 --> 00:04:25.652\nWow.\nYeah, which is pretty cool.\n\n82\n00:04:25.652 --> 00:04:27.548\nThat is cool.\nYes, cuz if I took this, now,\n\n83\n00:04:27.548 --> 00:04:31.632\nnotice that it's actually previewing\nthe information that I had selected.\n\n84\n00:04:31.632 --> 00:04:34.112\nWhich I think is pretty cool.\n\n85\n00:04:34.112 --> 00:04:36.562\nThat's pretty nice.\nAnd it's nice that it's giving you\n\n86\n00:04:36.562 --> 00:04:41.950\na cluster card column chart is used to\ncompare values across a few categories.\n\n87\n00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.390\nUse it when the order of\ncategories is not important.\n\n88\n00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.980\nHmm, okay, nice.\n\n89\n00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.760\nAnd then we have a stacked column chart,\nand\n\n90\n00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.476\nit gives you a little description here.\n\n91\n00:04:51.476 --> 00:04:56.210\nNow, a bar chart is really just\na column chart flipped over.\n\n92\n00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.423\nTurned the other way, yeah.\n\n93\n00:04:57.423 --> 00:04:59.085\n[LAUGH] Yeah,\nit's just [CROSSTALK] It fell over.\n\n94\n00:04:59.085 --> 00:05:02.415\n[LAUGH] Yeah, with this one, I mean,\nI think that if you're trying to think,\n\n95\n00:05:02.415 --> 00:05:06.062\nwho won the race type of thing, and\nthat's what I always think, all right.\n\n96\n00:05:06.062 --> 00:05:10.977\nSo it's just a different perspective\nalmost, as to who's the highest,\n\n97\n00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:15.360\nwho's the tallest, or\nwho got there the fastest?\n\n98\n00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.780\nAt least that's how my brain\nis thinking right now.\n\n99\n00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.860\nAnd then we have some other ones down here\nof where it's giving us these stacked.\n\n100\n00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.120\nThere's also this funnel chart,\n\n101\n00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.230\nnow I'm not sure if this particular data\nreally lends itself to the a funnel chart.\n\n102\n00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.250\nBut at least it is trying to\ngive us some information here.\n\n103\n00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.360\nNow I'm just gonna cancel this,\njust for one minute because\n\n104\n00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.970\nyour question really kind of like sparked\nme to show you this in a different way.\n\n105\n00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.060\nWhat if I had just selected this?\n\n106\n00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.240\nOkay, I didn't select Bishop.\n\n107\n00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.110\nBecause in our introduction\nwe did have that pie chart.\n\n108\n00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.950\nNow while we're gonna do a different\nepisode on that pie chart, if I had this,\n\n109\n00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.740\nwatch what happens when I do this\nrecommended, it's like, well look at that.\n\n110\n00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:02.440\nWell because I'm only\nseeing one category here,\n\n111\n00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:07.100\nI can go ahead and do this for\nyou, which is kinda neat.\n\n112\n00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.095\nCool.\nYeah, so\n\n113\n00:06:08.095 --> 00:06:11.595\nit will change depending\non what you have selected.\n\n114\n00:06:11.595 --> 00:06:13.851\nSo let's go back and\nselect all of that again, and\n\n115\n00:06:13.851 --> 00:06:16.090\nwe'll go to our recommended charts.\n\n116\n00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.250\nWell, what if I don't like any of\nthe recommendations that they gave?\n\n117\n00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.610\nYou have over here the all charts button.\n\n118\n00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.890\nAnd this is where it's\ngonna give you everything.\n\n119\n00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:30.090\nThey're breaking the ribbon down\nin the different types of charts.\n\n120\n00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.230\nAnd then in here, I kind of like this\ndialog box, and then it gives me\n\n121\n00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:38.765\neverything, because within the column\ncharts are the cluster column charts.\n\n122\n00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:41.663\nYou can see that I have some\ndifferent variations across the top.\n\n123\n00:06:41.663 --> 00:06:43.177\nAnd if you click on them,\n\n124\n00:06:43.177 --> 00:06:47.335\nit will give you some visuals as\nto what that's gonna look like.\n\n125\n00:06:47.335 --> 00:06:49.005\nA 3D cluster column chart.\n\n126\n00:06:49.005 --> 00:06:50.827\nIt gives you that perspective, there.\n\n127\n00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:54.878\nDo you want it to be a flat chart or\ndo you want it to have that 3D on there?\n\n128\n00:06:54.878 --> 00:06:58.155\nWhat would this look like as a line chart?\n\n129\n00:06:58.155 --> 00:06:59.195\nAs a pie chart?\n\n130\n00:06:59.195 --> 00:06:59.895\nAll of these ones.\n\n131\n00:06:59.895 --> 00:07:02.520\nNow there's some, I will tell you,\nthere are some charts in here.\n\n132\n00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.770\nBut even I'm like, hm, let's see what\na box and whisker type of chart.\n\n133\n00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:07.710\nI mean, we are talking about cats.\n\n134\n00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.404\nTrue.\nBut I'm not sure if that would be the one\n\n135\n00:07:10.404 --> 00:07:12.660\nyou would want to go with, here.\n\n136\n00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:17.870\nBut you can see that there are quite\na few different ones that definitely have\n\n137\n00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.837\nplaces as to where this starts to make me,\nit would think origami, or whatever.\n\n138\n00:07:20.837 --> 00:07:21.546\n[LAUGH] Yeah, it does.\nBut\n\n139\n00:07:21.546 --> 00:07:25.380\nit's kinda fun to see some of\nthese different ones in here.\n\n140\n00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:29.600\nBut like I said, in this episode, we're\ngonna stick with our clustered column.\n\n141\n00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.370\nWe're gonna keep it flat for right now.\n\n142\n00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:33.640\nAnd you can see as you hover over,\nit will go ahead and\n\n143\n00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.440\ngive you some like a larger preview.\n\n144\n00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:40.990\nOf what that will look like,\nwe click okay, and there you go.\n\n145\n00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:46.490\nIt has inserted this chart as\na graphical element by default\n\n146\n00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:52.326\nin the same worksheet that I have\npulled the information from.\n\n147\n00:07:52.326 --> 00:07:54.570\nSounds fantastic.\n\n148\n00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:57.958\nAnd it is using those cell\nreferences to that particular data.\n\n149\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:01.566\nAnd I can see those purple and red,\n\n150\n00:08:01.566 --> 00:08:05.684\nand blue boxes around my information.\n\n151\n00:08:05.684 --> 00:08:10.901\nTo be able to kind of show me where\neverything it is pulling from.\n\n152\n00:08:10.901 --> 00:08:13.475\nAnd when we get into functions as well,\n\n153\n00:08:13.475 --> 00:08:18.233\nit's the same idea as using that cell\nreference as if your data changes.\n\n154\n00:08:18.233 --> 00:08:20.025\nIf I came over here and said,\n\n155\n00:08:20.025 --> 00:08:24.004\nI need to see, hey Bishop actually\neats more than three hours.\n\n156\n00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:28.933\nHe eats four hours a day, and\nthen you see that if you hit enter,\n\n157\n00:08:28.933 --> 00:08:33.311\nit's going to change\nthe The columns within the chart.\n\n158\n00:08:33.311 --> 00:08:36.920\nIf I said, well,\nlet's see that Fuego sleeps 16 hours.\n\n159\n00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.130\nI know this might not add up to 24.\n\n160\n00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:40.010\nDon't worry about the math right now.\n\n161\n00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:41.660\nWe're just working with numbers.\n\n162\n00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:42.549\nYou see that the chart changes.\n\n163\n00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:46.063\nSo it is dynamic in\na sense that the values or\n\n164\n00:08:46.063 --> 00:08:51.545\nthe information that it is charting,\nthey connect, obviously.\n\n165\n00:08:51.545 --> 00:08:54.484\nSo we get, well I have to say, obviously,\n\n166\n00:08:54.484 --> 00:08:59.158\nI didn't know that but now since I\ndemonstrated to you, you get it.\n\n167\n00:08:59.158 --> 00:09:01.779\nIt is obvious.\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] All right so\n\n168\n00:09:01.779 --> 00:09:04.967\nif I come up over here,\nselect the chart again,\n\n169\n00:09:04.967 --> 00:09:09.910\nNotice I'm just gonna go and hang the chat\narea and then I can come over here\n\n170\n00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:14.950\nto the different pieces in my\ncontextual tabs I have my design.\n\n171\n00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:17.480\nWe can change our quick layout.\n\n172\n00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:21.920\nThis would be nice, cuz maybe I don't\nwant the legend to be on the bottom,\n\n173\n00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.060\nI want the legend to be on the top.\n\n174\n00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.287\nWhat if I want a data table in there?\n\n175\n00:09:26.287 --> 00:09:31.202\nNow these are just kind of easier ones\nto just throw out the layouts that\n\n176\n00:09:31.202 --> 00:09:35.618\nthey've determined, but\nyou do have the control over what you\n\n177\n00:09:35.618 --> 00:09:39.449\nwant added if you go over into the,\nadd chart element,\n\n178\n00:09:39.449 --> 00:09:44.530\ncuz maybe I would like the legend on\nthe top or the bottom or the right.\n\n179\n00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:49.044\nSo, I can come down into the element and\nsay lets go ahead and put it on the top,\n\n180\n00:09:49.044 --> 00:09:50.101\nand there you go.\n\n181\n00:09:50.101 --> 00:09:53.544\nMaybe I would like to\nput in other grid lines,\n\n182\n00:09:53.544 --> 00:09:57.490\ncuz it's just showing\nthe major grid lines.\n\n183\n00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:01.041\nWhat if I wanted to put\nthe minor grid lines on there?\n\n184\n00:10:01.041 --> 00:10:04.668\nThere might be hard to see on this\nparticular monitor, but just going\n\n185\n00:10:04.668 --> 00:10:08.870\nthrough each one of these different pieces\nand saying if you want them on or off.\n\n186\n00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:12.020\nNow, this particular one I\nwanna take the minors off.\n\n187\n00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.570\nSo I'm gonna click it again,\nthat takes it off.\n\n188\n00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:17.550\nAgain, if you didn't see that, they\nwere really light grey lines in there.\n\n189\n00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:22.580\nSo just kinda going along that\nsame idea of what you can\n\n190\n00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:27.850\nadd into the charts individually,\nrather than going by\n\n191\n00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:32.770\na group layout that has\neverything predetermined for you.\n\n192\n00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:38.480\nSo let's come over here to\nsome of our access titles,\n\n193\n00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.020\nbecause I have sleep, eat, meow and play.\n\n194\n00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.280\nWell then what is that?\n\n195\n00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.730\nI want to put a label on that.\n\n196\n00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:49.680\nDo I want to also put it on the vertical,\ncuz maybe those numbers,\n\n197\n00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.900\nthis is where, are those numbers money?\n\n198\n00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.210\nAre these hours?\n\n199\n00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:57.960\nWhat are we actually charting?\n\n200\n00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.100\nSo one easy way to do it\nis add a title on there.\n\n201\n00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:05.610\nAnd what it does is it adds that piece,\nbut it does not add any text.\n\n202\n00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:10.452\nSaying words like, chart title, that\ndoes'nt- Yeah Really say anything either.\n\n203\n00:11:10.452 --> 00:11:12.835\nSo we have our access title,\nchart title, but\n\n204\n00:11:12.835 --> 00:11:16.760\nit's giving us that piece that then\nwe can come into and change it.\n\n205\n00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.315\nNow four pointed arrows always means\nthat you're selecting the element.\n\n206\n00:11:20.315 --> 00:11:22.302\nSo if I click it, click there,\n\n207\n00:11:22.302 --> 00:11:25.830\nI've got that because if I\nwanted to I could move this.\n\n208\n00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:28.750\nI can take that four pointed arrow and\nI can move it to the left or\n\n209\n00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:29.770\nmove it to the right.\n\n210\n00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:32.630\nI'm gonna undo that because I\nwant to keep that right there.\n\n211\n00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:33.900\nBut you get the I-beam.\n\n212\n00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.270\nWhen you get the I-beam\nthat always means text.\n\n213\n00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:37.419\nYou can click in there.\n\n214\n00:11:37.419 --> 00:11:38.882\nAnd then you can select it.\n\n215\n00:11:38.882 --> 00:11:45.210\nI just did a triple click in there\nto select the whole paragraph.\n\n216\n00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:51.940\nAnd then we can say activity of Fuego and\nBishop, that's\n\n217\n00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:56.120\na nice descriptive title right there\nto let everybody know what's going on.\n\n218\n00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:00.980\nGo ahead and do the same thing over here,\nwe can go ahead and type this in as hours.\n\n219\n00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:03.550\nAnd if you wanted to, you could change and\n\n220\n00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:07.840\nadd an axis title on\nthe category if you would like.\n\n221\n00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.750\nNow I don't really feel like I need that,\nbecause I feel like the The chart title.\n\n222\n00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:16.850\nIt's a bit self explanatory and\nunnecessarily redundant.\n\n223\n00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:18.300\nYeah, but again, it's personal choice.\n\n224\n00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.450\nThat's true.\nIf you wanted to put down there Activity,\n\n225\n00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:24.400\nmake it very, very clear that that's\nwhat this is, totally fine with that.\n\n226\n00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.970\nEspecially since a lot of these things\nare gonna be shown to a multiple\n\n227\n00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:28.480\ndifferent people.\n\n228\n00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.710\nSo it's not just you.\n\n229\n00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:32.031\nIt's gonna be the people out there and\nsomeone might not get,\n\n230\n00:12:32.031 --> 00:12:33.921\nwhat are these numbers on\nthe left hand side here?\n\n231\n00:12:33.921 --> 00:12:34.690\nI just don't understand.\n\n232\n00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:35.421\nIs it minutes?\n\n233\n00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:35.991\nIs it seconds?\n\n234\n00:12:35.991 --> 00:12:37.067\nIs it days?\n\n235\n00:12:37.067 --> 00:12:39.888\nSo put hours there could be helpful.\n\n236\n00:12:39.888 --> 00:12:44.480\nExactly, you want to try and make this\nas clear as possible for as many people,\n\n237\n00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.671\nlike you just said.\n\n238\n00:12:45.671 --> 00:12:49.475\nNow, let's start going into\nsome different styles.\n\n239\n00:12:49.475 --> 00:12:51.250\nThat's a little crazy.\n\n240\n00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:54.411\nDo I want one with like\na gradient background in here,\n\n241\n00:12:54.411 --> 00:12:56.037\ndo I want one with a darker.\n\n242\n00:12:56.037 --> 00:13:00.110\nYou can see it has some like hash lines\nbehind it, the diagonals and so on and\n\n243\n00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.700\nso forth.\n\n244\n00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.480\nSo you can pick the different ones.\n\n245\n00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.000\nBut I did wanna point out a few\ndifferent things right now.\n\n246\n00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.530\nDo you see on this particular style\nversus this particular style,\n\n247\n00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:11.930\nyou see how like\nthe series are spaced out?\n\n248\n00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:13.810\nDo you see like the columns?\n\n249\n00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:14.440\nLike this one.\n\n250\n00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:17.041\nThey're right next to each other,\nbut then they have a lines.\n\n251\n00:13:17.041 --> 00:13:21.315\nThis is one of those things that I\nalways couldn't find where to actually\n\n252\n00:13:21.315 --> 00:13:25.168\nstart to change that, and\nthere was something that bothered me so\n\n253\n00:13:25.168 --> 00:13:28.201\nI'm going to show you were\nthat is in just a minute.\n\n254\n00:13:28.201 --> 00:13:31.002\nSo just coming back around,\nI just wanted to kind of point that out.\n\n255\n00:13:31.002 --> 00:13:34.203\nYou can go ahead and\nthrow a style on this and just be done,\n\n256\n00:13:34.203 --> 00:13:36.160\nyou don't have to go any further.\n\n257\n00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.034\nBut if you did want to go through and\n\n258\n00:13:39.034 --> 00:13:43.210\nchange the specific parts of this chart,\nright?\n\n259\n00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:46.362\nMaybe we can make it look like\nthat introduction to where we have\n\n260\n00:13:46.362 --> 00:13:50.770\nthe different textures and gradients that\nmake this chart look really, really scary.\n\n261\n00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:53.970\n[LAUGH] You need to go ahead and\nselect those different pieces.\n\n262\n00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:55.893\nSo I'm over the plot area.\n\n263\n00:13:55.893 --> 00:14:00.089\nIf I select that one piece,\nthen I can come into the format and\n\n264\n00:14:00.089 --> 00:14:03.565\nwe can go through and\nchange the different fills.\n\n265\n00:14:03.565 --> 00:14:05.865\nNow it is pulling from our theme colors.\n\n266\n00:14:05.865 --> 00:14:07.590\nSo these are the ones we have at the top.\n\n267\n00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:10.290\nYou can always go into your more colors.\n\n268\n00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:13.660\nBut this is where you can go into\nhey you want to add that picture,\n\n269\n00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:15.130\nyou go right ahead.\n\n270\n00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:18.670\nAnd then you can add\nthe picture from the file.\n\n271\n00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:20.960\nLet's go ahead and\nput mister Fuego pants in there.\n\n272\n00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:25.100\nAnd okay, I think we're already\ngetting a little crazy here.\n\n273\n00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:28.810\nBut you can always come back and\njust say I don't want any fill.\n\n274\n00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:31.540\nOr you could also go into a gradient film.\n\n275\n00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.350\nOr you can also go into texture.\n\n276\n00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:35.355\nYou know I love that dead fish texture.\n\n277\n00:14:35.355 --> 00:14:36.924\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] It is your favorite.\n\n278\n00:14:36.924 --> 00:14:37.696\nRight, you know.\n\n279\n00:14:37.696 --> 00:14:40.040\nIt's just one of those ones\nthat just always gives me a.\n\n280\n00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.176\nIt's like you're an archeologist or\nsomething.\n\n281\n00:14:41.176 --> 00:14:44.803\n[LAUGH] Maybe if you\nare an archeologist right?\n\n282\n00:14:44.803 --> 00:14:45.737\nHey there you go.\n\n283\n00:14:45.737 --> 00:14:48.907\nIt could be you're shtick.\n\n284\n00:14:48.907 --> 00:14:49.800\nIt could be.\nRight?\n\n285\n00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:54.829\n[LAUGH] So I have the different ones\nhere and we can go into our textures or\n\n286\n00:14:54.829 --> 00:14:58.250\ngradients and\nthis is the same for any element.\n\n287\n00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:00.611\nI am going to go with No for night now.\n\n288\n00:15:00.611 --> 00:15:06.301\nLet's talk about those series,\nbecause that is something\n\n289\n00:15:06.301 --> 00:15:11.330\nwe need to be aware of here,\nwhen you are selecting.\n\n290\n00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.967\nIf I hover this first series,\nthe Fuego series, I single click,\n\n291\n00:15:14.967 --> 00:15:16.958\nnotice I selected all four of them.\n\n292\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:20.342\nAnd then I can change the fill,\nto let's just make it yellow, for now.\n\n293\n00:15:20.342 --> 00:15:23.598\nBut, if once I have them selected,\n\n294\n00:15:23.598 --> 00:15:28.712\nI then single click,\na specific point, of the series.\n\n295\n00:15:28.712 --> 00:15:32.578\nOne click here, notice how I've\nbasically deselected, the other ones.\n\n296\n00:15:32.578 --> 00:15:37.320\nAnd now, I've isolated that\none piece of that series.\n\n297\n00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:40.900\nAnd if I changed this one,\nI can change that independently.\n\n298\n00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:45.261\nBut now, the thing is,\nisn't the whole idea about making\n\n299\n00:15:45.261 --> 00:15:50.250\nthe series the same color is that\nFuego is indicated by the yellow.\n\n300\n00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:53.061\nIf you change one to purple,\nthat kind of throws it all off.\n\n301\n00:15:53.061 --> 00:15:57.535\nI mean, there's something to\nsay about the consistency of\n\n302\n00:15:57.535 --> 00:16:02.300\nthe color of this series in\nthis particular chart so I.\n\n303\n00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.483\nI might not necessarily\nwant to isolate this.\n\n304\n00:16:04.483 --> 00:16:09.108\nBut if you really wanted to point\nout that, wow man, Fuego eats a lot.\n\n305\n00:16:09.108 --> 00:16:11.211\n[LAUGH] Maybe change- Man likes food,\nwhat are you saying?\n\n306\n00:16:11.211 --> 00:16:17.033\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] Maybe change it to\na different shade of yellow that might for\n\n307\n00:16:17.033 --> 00:16:19.918\na little bit of emphasis like, hey,\n\n308\n00:16:19.918 --> 00:16:22.762\nhe's gotta The same color\nas his clogged arteries.\n\n309\n00:16:22.762 --> 00:16:25.993\n[LAUGH] Yeah [LAUGH] Yes,\nhe is supposed on diet but\n\n310\n00:16:25.993 --> 00:16:29.125\nhe keeps seeming to like just get\na little bit denser everyday.\n\n311\n00:16:29.125 --> 00:16:33.500\n[LAUGH] So we've got the colors\nthat you wanted to do.\n\n312\n00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.499\nAnd you can go through.\n\n313\n00:16:35.499 --> 00:16:37.694\nAnd whether they're all selected or\n\n314\n00:16:37.694 --> 00:16:41.390\nsingle parts of it's selected\nyou can add outlines on this.\n\n315\n00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:42.810\nYou could add effects.\n\n316\n00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:47.000\nYou can make this have different glows and\nall sorts of fun stuff.\n\n317\n00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.545\nRemember, we're trying to\nkeep this nice looking.\n\n318\n00:16:50.545 --> 00:16:54.095\nMan, I'm already seeing how I can\nmake this look like a lightsaber.\n\n319\n00:16:54.095 --> 00:16:55.420\n[LAUGH] Be awesome.\n\n320\n00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.190\nRight, okay, we could go ahead and\ngussy it up just like we love to do.\n\n321\n00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:00.031\nThat's right, that's right.\n\n322\n00:17:00.031 --> 00:17:04.770\nSo everything has that option of\nhaving the format individually.\n\n323\n00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:05.989\nAnd you can go through all of that.\n\n324\n00:17:05.989 --> 00:17:08.454\nBut I don't want any effects on this.\n\n325\n00:17:08.454 --> 00:17:12.738\nSo why don't we go ahead and\ntake some of those presets.\n\n326\n00:17:12.738 --> 00:17:15.100\nWe can take the shadow.\n\n327\n00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:17.418\nWe don't on any glow, it was a glow.\n\n328\n00:17:17.418 --> 00:17:23.130\nAnd we'll take the outline off and\nwe will make them all the same color.\n\n329\n00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:25.478\nMaybe not pink, but\nwe'll go ahead and make it purple.\n\n330\n00:17:25.478 --> 00:17:29.929\nAll right,\nsome other things that I want to show\n\n331\n00:17:29.929 --> 00:17:34.504\nyou is the format task pane for\neach one of these.\n\n332\n00:17:34.504 --> 00:17:39.280\nAnd this is gonna go along with that\nthing that I kinda hinted to of\n\n333\n00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.560\nthe how close together these series' are.\n\n334\n00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:47.254\nBecause changing the color and the outline\nand throwing the style on it and\n\n335\n00:17:47.254 --> 00:17:51.493\nthen if I wanted to change any of\nthe word or for any specific piece,\n\n336\n00:17:51.493 --> 00:17:57.360\nokay that's great but those specifics, and\nwhat about right here, 18 hours in a day?\n\n337\n00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.240\nThis is what I would call the ceiling,\nokay?\n\n338\n00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.130\nIf I was trying to demonstrate a point of,\n\n339\n00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:08.263\nnow I'm gonna switch in midstream\npretend this is money right now [LAUGH].\n\n340\n00:18:08.263 --> 00:18:10.406\nPretend these are sales and\nnot the activity.\n\n341\n00:18:10.406 --> 00:18:15.388\n[INAUDIBLE] we're saying, hey,\nwe're really shooting for\n\n342\n00:18:15.388 --> 00:18:18.329\n$24,000 a minute in sales.\n\n343\n00:18:18.329 --> 00:18:23.104\n[LAUGH] That ceiling, it stops at 18.\n\n344\n00:18:23.104 --> 00:18:26.540\nI wanna show that,\nno we need to be up here.\n\n345\n00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.639\nAnd your numbers are down here.\n\n346\n00:18:28.639 --> 00:18:30.881\nHow do I [INAUDIBLE] Or if it was\nhours in a day and you were like,\n\n347\n00:18:30.881 --> 00:18:32.736\nI'm trying to sleep 24\nhours in a whole day.\n\n348\n00:18:32.736 --> 00:18:35.105\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] Yeah, I'm- Show that.\n\n349\n00:18:35.105 --> 00:18:38.033\nI'm trying to show a true representation\nof the- Daily hours, yeah.\n\n350\n00:18:38.033 --> 00:18:39.163\nNumber of hours.\n\n351\n00:18:39.163 --> 00:18:40.490\n[LAUGH] Yeah, that kind of stuff.\n\n352\n00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:43.526\nSo that's what I call a series,\nI believe they call it a bound, but\n\n353\n00:18:43.526 --> 00:18:47.014\nwe'll double-check because I can\nshow you where's it's at, all right.\n\n354\n00:18:47.014 --> 00:18:50.185\nAnd it does also correlate\nwith the series thing.\n\n355\n00:18:50.185 --> 00:18:55.055\nSo we do need to come within each one\nof our parts that we wanna change, and\n\n356\n00:18:55.055 --> 00:18:58.995\nwe're gonna change the series first,\nmake them closer together.\n\n357\n00:18:58.995 --> 00:19:03.770\nCome into here, if you right-click and\nyou go to Format Data Series, and\n\n358\n00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:04.610\nthen you could select it.\n\n359\n00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:07.228\nYou're gonna bring over this\ntesting over on the right.\n\n360\n00:19:07.228 --> 00:19:10.828\nAnd this is the same thing that we've\nseen when we did our format sheet,\n\n361\n00:19:10.828 --> 00:19:11.612\nformat image.\n\n362\n00:19:11.612 --> 00:19:15.702\nThis task pane over here is\njust gonna give us more stuff,\n\n363\n00:19:15.702 --> 00:19:20.330\nmore options for us to be able\nto pour slide as left and right.\n\n364\n00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:24.857\nAnd the thing you do have to be careful\nabout is look at what item we're on\n\n365\n00:19:24.857 --> 00:19:29.459\nbecause I could use this task pane to\ntake the fill of the selected item and\n\n366\n00:19:29.459 --> 00:19:31.504\nwe can make our gradient fills.\n\n367\n00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:35.992\nThis is where we had some fun with\nour shapes to where we can add\n\n368\n00:19:35.992 --> 00:19:38.380\ndifferent types of gradients.\n\n369\n00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:41.728\nAnd then on our gradient ramp,\nwe could come and\n\n370\n00:19:41.728 --> 00:19:44.838\nchange the different colors on the houses.\n\n371\n00:19:44.838 --> 00:19:46.250\nI should probably stop right now,\n\n372\n00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:48.500\ncuz I'm gonna start having\nway too much fun with this.\n\n373\n00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.360\nBut if you're like, what is this?\n\n374\n00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.203\nShow me more.\n\n375\n00:19:51.203 --> 00:19:57.357\nIf you go into our Excel advanced series\nand go into the graphical elements,\n\n376\n00:19:57.357 --> 00:20:02.270\nI do a lot of this kind of stuff so\nit is cut in other places.\n\n377\n00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:07.700\nAnd I'm gonna control myself right now and\nkeep the same task as well is supposed\n\n378\n00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:13.655\nto be which is the overlapping stuff\nthat just showing, am I on this film.\n\n379\n00:20:13.655 --> 00:20:15.255\nAm I on the effects?\n\n380\n00:20:15.255 --> 00:20:17.014\nNo, we wanna be on this particular button.\n\n381\n00:20:17.014 --> 00:20:21.675\nYou see the series options button,\nwhich, yes, it was on by default, well,\n\n382\n00:20:21.675 --> 00:20:23.308\nwhy did you click off of it?\n\n383\n00:20:23.308 --> 00:20:27.110\nJust in case you got\nput in somewhere else.\n\n384\n00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:28.090\nIt's right here.\n\n385\n00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:32.130\nThe series overlap and the gap width.\n\n386\n00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:36.200\nAnd right now it says the series\noverlap is negative 27.\n\n387\n00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.137\nThink of it.\nIf I have a negative overlap then I\n\n388\n00:20:39.137 --> 00:20:41.668\nactually have it further apart.\n\n389\n00:20:41.668 --> 00:20:46.039\nOkay, that's why, the columns\nare farther away from each other so\n\n390\n00:20:46.039 --> 00:20:51.329\nif I take this, series over and make it\nzero I'm gonna physically typing that in,\n\n391\n00:20:51.329 --> 00:20:54.794\nthere you go that's what I\nwas always driving crazy.\n\n392\n00:20:54.794 --> 00:20:56.362\nI want them next to each other.\n\n393\n00:20:56.362 --> 00:20:58.340\nSo I had to just take the overlap to zero.\n\n394\n00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:02.962\nNow if you increase that overlap, do you\nsee how, well they're gonna overlap.\n\n395\n00:21:02.962 --> 00:21:08.290\n[LAUGH] So a positive overlap\nversus a negative overlap.\n\n396\n00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:09.950\nNow 50 might be a little too much but\n\n397\n00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:15.690\nyou can see that's gonna change\nthe space between the columns.\n\n398\n00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:20.350\nNow you also have the gap width\nright here, it says 219%.\n\n399\n00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:22.484\nWhat if I did like 100.\n\n400\n00:21:22.484 --> 00:21:28.315\nOkay, so now you can see that the width\nbetween each one of these categories.\n\n401\n00:21:28.315 --> 00:21:33.665\nThat's where it's gonna be decreased so\nthen our width of our series,\n\n402\n00:21:33.665 --> 00:21:36.555\nthe columns, are going to be\nable to get a little bit bigger.\n\n403\n00:21:36.555 --> 00:21:41.265\nSo you can modify this by going\ninto that format data series.\n\n404\n00:21:42.315 --> 00:21:43.428\nVery cool.\n\n405\n00:21:43.428 --> 00:21:49.305\nAlong those same lines,\nthese up across the top are value access.\n\n406\n00:21:49.305 --> 00:21:50.225\nI want to change that.\n\n407\n00:21:50.225 --> 00:21:54.383\nNow I can come out here and\nclick on the value access and\n\n408\n00:21:54.383 --> 00:22:01.280\nthen it changes over here, but I did want\nto point out, look at this option up here.\n\n409\n00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:04.640\nIf I dropped this down,\nwhat if I wanted to format the chart area?\n\n410\n00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:09.455\nYou can go ahead and actually use this\ntask pane to select the different\n\n411\n00:22:09.455 --> 00:22:14.280\npieces from this area and like,\nokay I want a purple fill right there.\n\n412\n00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:18.921\nSo that's kinda neat that you can use\nit as a selection say what do I want?\n\n413\n00:22:18.921 --> 00:22:23.210\nAnd knowing do I want a vertical axis,\ndo I want a horizontal axis.\n\n414\n00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:26.530\nBut we're going to go\nwith the one right there.\n\n415\n00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:27.057\nPerfect.\n\n416\n00:22:27.057 --> 00:22:32.020\nAnd I'm going to come other here to,\nhold on one second.\n\n417\n00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:34.137\nThat just see all the line it's\njust got weird I know why.\n\n418\n00:22:34.137 --> 00:22:35.560\nIt did get weird.\n\n419\n00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.190\nYeah because I took the chat area,\n\n420\n00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:42.040\nand I took the no fill, we really do\nwanna solid fill we want it to be solid\n\n421\n00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:45.350\nwhite cuz what we're seeing is\nthe actually grid lines Behind it.\n\n422\n00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:48.210\nThe worksheet, and\nthat's why it's like I don't want\n\n423\n00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:52.010\npeople to get a little freaked out on that\ncuz it freaked me out like what did I do?\n\n424\n00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:53.550\nDid I turn the grid lines on?\n\n425\n00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:55.859\nNope, I didn't I just changed the fill.\n\n426\n00:22:55.859 --> 00:23:02.200\nSo come back over to the value axis and\nwe will go there.\n\n427\n00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:05.937\nAnd now we want to come over\nto the axis options and\n\n428\n00:23:05.937 --> 00:23:09.596\nthat's where I could\nchange the options here.\n\n429\n00:23:09.596 --> 00:23:11.788\nThere it is, it is called bounds.\n\n430\n00:23:11.788 --> 00:23:15.416\nI call them series, no I didn't call\nit series, I called it ceiling,\n\n431\n00:23:15.416 --> 00:23:16.532\nthat's what [LAUGH].\n\n432\n00:23:16.532 --> 00:23:21.285\nSo you can see that the maximum is 18,\nwe type in 24 and\n\n433\n00:23:21.285 --> 00:23:25.067\nthere is the ceiling\nthat I wanna be hitting.\n\n434\n00:23:25.067 --> 00:23:27.805\nAnd then we can switch over to\nour sales like we did before.\n\n435\n00:23:27.805 --> 00:23:34.131\n[LAUGH] And the units right here, how\nmany major units do I want them to be in?\n\n436\n00:23:34.131 --> 00:23:35.381\nAnd then what's my minimum?\n\n437\n00:23:35.381 --> 00:23:36.971\nIt says negative one.\n\n438\n00:23:36.971 --> 00:23:38.190\nI don't want that to be.\n\n439\n00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:38.954\nWe can't have a negative out.\n\n440\n00:23:38.954 --> 00:23:41.000\nWe're going to start out at zero.\n\n441\n00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.610\nAnd now that's where you\ncan really see that major\n\n442\n00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:48.390\nincrement right there is going in fives\nmaybe I wanted this to be in fours.\n\n443\n00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:52.332\nAnd so you can see that's where it's\ngoing to change how many grid lines.\n\n444\n00:23:52.332 --> 00:23:53.388\nIf I had it at two,\n\n445\n00:23:53.388 --> 00:23:58.541\nthen that's where it's going to have your\ndifferent increments of your major lines.\n\n446\n00:23:58.541 --> 00:24:02.570\nMaybe I wanted to have\nthis to be every six.\n\n447\n00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:06.226\nBut then I want minors to be at every two.\n\n448\n00:24:06.226 --> 00:24:11.139\nAnd then if I wanted to turn those on, I\ncould turn on the minor grid lines versus\n\n449\n00:24:11.139 --> 00:24:14.125\nthe major grid lines if\nyou wanted to change it.\n\n450\n00:24:14.125 --> 00:24:17.899\nSo all the different things that\nyou couldn't get from up here and\n\n451\n00:24:17.899 --> 00:24:21.137\ninto the dropdowns,\nthis is just like kinda adding it.\n\n452\n00:24:21.137 --> 00:24:25.971\nThis really gets in to the nitty\ngritty of what you're wanting to\n\n453\n00:24:25.971 --> 00:24:28.310\nshow on these value axis.\n\n454\n00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:32.390\nAnd then if I collapse this down,\nthis is another one like the tick marks.\n\n455\n00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:34.430\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n456\n00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:37.330\nSo if I go with a outside,\nthere, you see that one?\n\n457\n00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:40.226\nThere's a tiny little line outside there.\n\n458\n00:24:40.226 --> 00:24:43.998\nVersus cross, you see that, kind of?\n\n459\n00:24:43.998 --> 00:24:46.808\nI do.\nYeah, [LAUGH] so it's a minor thing, but\n\n460\n00:24:46.808 --> 00:24:51.438\nit's one of those where you wouldn't\nhave been able to find it if you\n\n461\n00:24:51.438 --> 00:24:53.813\nhadn't gone into this task pane.\n\n462\n00:24:53.813 --> 00:24:59.010\nLet's go down to the category axis for\na little bit of change down there.\n\n463\n00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:03.130\nCuz that's kinda going along the idea of,\nI don't want these to be across.\n\n464\n00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:08.361\nCuz maybe you have a lot of text that\nis kind of just overlapping each other.\n\n465\n00:25:08.361 --> 00:25:12.756\nYou could take your Axis Options and\n\n466\n00:25:12.756 --> 00:25:16.718\nyou could change the, wait.\n\n467\n00:25:16.718 --> 00:25:17.810\nThere it is,\nit's in the labels, I'm sorry.\n\n468\n00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:20.382\nLet me go ahead and change that.\n\n469\n00:25:20.382 --> 00:25:24.888\nAnd then we go into the labels,\nand I'm looking for the change.\n\n470\n00:25:24.888 --> 00:25:25.514\nWhere is it?\n\n471\n00:25:25.514 --> 00:25:26.177\nHold on.\n\n472\n00:25:26.177 --> 00:25:28.980\n[LAUGH] There it is,\nI'm on the wrong button.\n\n473\n00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:32.610\nThere's my alignment, I wanna\nchange the text direction, perfect.\n\n474\n00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:35.472\nSo, if I rotate this,\nnow you can see how the text is going up.\n\n475\n00:25:35.472 --> 00:25:38.541\nThat's another one that people are like,\nwhere do I find that?\n\n476\n00:25:38.541 --> 00:25:43.530\nAnd if I wanted to, you could change it to\nthe different ones with the horizontal.\n\n477\n00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:50.900\nOr you can get into a custom alignment,\nbut let's see how we can get into that.\n\n478\n00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.499\nWell, it's not giving me\nthe option to do that.\n\n479\n00:25:53.499 --> 00:25:57.752\nWell, hm, we'll have to come back and\nfigure that out.\n\n480\n00:25:57.752 --> 00:26:03.589\n[LAUGH] But, it's right there.\n\n481\n00:26:03.589 --> 00:26:06.614\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] Custom angle.\n\n482\n00:26:06.614 --> 00:26:08.512\nSo to get to that custom angle,\n\n483\n00:26:08.512 --> 00:26:12.832\nwe do have to make sure that the text\ndirection's back to horizontal.\n\n484\n00:26:12.832 --> 00:26:16.518\nCuz if you had changed it to something\nelse, if you had made it rotate,\n\n485\n00:26:16.518 --> 00:26:19.110\nthen the field isn't\navailable to you there.\n\n486\n00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:22.252\nSo if you go back to horizontal,\ncuz maybe you wanna go ahead and\n\n487\n00:26:22.252 --> 00:26:25.705\nput that as a 45 degree angle,\nwe probably have to do the other one.\n\n488\n00:26:25.705 --> 00:26:27.340\nOo, this is where we're\ngonna have to get some math.\n\n489\n00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:27.844\nYou know what?\n\n490\n00:26:27.844 --> 00:26:29.145\nLet's just go ahead and\nmake those bumpy arrows.\n\n491\n00:26:29.145 --> 00:26:30.134\n[LAUGH] Yeah, look at that.\n\n492\n00:26:30.134 --> 00:26:31.135\nThere we go.\n\n493\n00:26:31.135 --> 00:26:33.543\nJust hold it down and let it move.\n\n494\n00:26:33.543 --> 00:26:35.873\nYeah, well,\nthen actually that would be a -45.\n\n495\n00:26:35.873 --> 00:26:36.773\nOkay, there, see,\n\n496\n00:26:36.773 --> 00:26:40.360\nas soon I started doing the bump,\nhe's like, just put a negative on it.\n\n497\n00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:41.169\nYay math!\nAll right, so\n\n498\n00:26:41.169 --> 00:26:43.079\nthat's where you can\nchange the angle of it.\n\n499\n00:26:43.079 --> 00:26:48.059\nBut again, more options in your\ndifferent items within your charts.\n\n500\n00:26:48.059 --> 00:26:50.219\nCome over to that Format Task pane,\n\n501\n00:26:50.219 --> 00:26:54.684\nand you could've gotten it from\nright-clicking on any element in here.\n\n502\n00:26:54.684 --> 00:26:58.820\nI could've just been on the plot area,\nand it's gonna bring this up.\n\n503\n00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:01.540\nAnd you know now that we have that\ndropdown to change the different\n\n504\n00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:02.683\nplaces where we need to be.\n\n505\n00:27:02.683 --> 00:27:05.773\nOkay, now let's go ahead and\nclose this task pane for now.\n\n506\n00:27:05.773 --> 00:27:06.917\nJust a few more things that,\n\n507\n00:27:06.917 --> 00:27:09.739\nI know you're giving me that signal\nwe need to start wrapping this up.\n\n508\n00:27:09.739 --> 00:27:12.800\nWe're coming to the end of our episode.\n\n509\n00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.630\nWe do have this switch between rows and\ncolumns now.\n\n510\n00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:20.189\nThat's really easy to where now\nwe're going to be using Fuego and\n\n511\n00:27:20.189 --> 00:27:24.264\ncomparing his different activities,\nso just turning the rows and columns.\n\n512\n00:27:24.264 --> 00:27:27.865\nWe also, we'll come back over\nhere to this Select Data.\n\n513\n00:27:27.865 --> 00:27:30.978\nLet's go over these in another\nepisode to where I can\n\n514\n00:27:30.978 --> 00:27:34.463\nreally kind of accentuate why\nwe might wanna come to here.\n\n515\n00:27:34.463 --> 00:27:37.583\nBecause this is a very simple and\neasy example of like, well,\n\n516\n00:27:37.583 --> 00:27:39.093\neverything looks just fine.\n\n517\n00:27:39.093 --> 00:27:42.799\nI don't need to come in here\nto pick different things.\n\n518\n00:27:42.799 --> 00:27:47.255\nBut if information isn't as beautiful,\nwe organized as this,\n\n519\n00:27:47.255 --> 00:27:51.886\nthis is where this dialog box will\ncome into play a little bit more.\n\n520\n00:27:51.886 --> 00:27:55.870\nSo we'll come back around\nto that in another episode.\n\n521\n00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:59.480\nWe could also come into where\nyou wanna move the chart.\n\n522\n00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:03.020\nRight now, it's just an element\nwithin this worksheet.\n\n523\n00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:05.865\nBut if I wanted,\nI can make it its all by itself,\n\n524\n00:28:05.865 --> 00:28:10.380\nget his own sheet, let's move it on over\nthere and then, there we go, perfect.\n\n525\n00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:15.295\nSo now this is where maybe if I wanted to\nhelp print this out, just have it on one\n\n526\n00:28:15.295 --> 00:28:20.990\nworksheet, as opposed to an element within\nthat worksheet, that could be really nice.\n\n527\n00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:25.480\nAnd then if you really wanted to come\nover here and change the type of chart,\n\n528\n00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:29.710\nyou can make it into a bar chart or\ninto one of those line charts.\n\n529\n00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:34.980\nSometime information doesn't lend itself\nto going into other charts very well.\n\n530\n00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:38.294\nLike this wouldn't necessarily be,\noo, that's a weird-looking pie piece.\n\n531\n00:28:38.294 --> 00:28:40.321\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] So\nwe'll just keep it with the column.\n\n532\n00:28:40.321 --> 00:28:46.510\nMaybe we can throw it into a bar chart,\njust to see who's winning there.\n\n533\n00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:50.824\nAnd the last thing I'd like to just\npoint out, and this is basic charts and\n\n534\n00:28:50.824 --> 00:28:51.879\nhow to format it.\n\n535\n00:28:51.879 --> 00:28:55.307\nThere's all these little buttons\nover here on the right-hand side.\n\n536\n00:28:56.346 --> 00:28:57.760\nJust different places that you can go to,\n\n537\n00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:03.020\nto add a chart element,\nas opposed to going on to the Design tab.\n\n538\n00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:06.900\nYou could also come in to the Format\nOptions, where you can do some of\n\n539\n00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:11.580\ndifferent styles or go right into\nthe different color blocks and everything.\n\n540\n00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:15.380\nSo you can quickly pick from there,\nrather than going to the tab.\n\n541\n00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:18.208\nBut the last one right here,\nthe filtering,\n\n542\n00:29:18.208 --> 00:29:23.055\nis to where maybe I don't want to see\nthe sleeping and eating for some reason.\n\n543\n00:29:23.055 --> 00:29:26.008\nI only want to see the meows,\nso I was like,\n\n544\n00:29:26.008 --> 00:29:29.717\nI don't want to change\nthe data from the select data.\n\n545\n00:29:29.717 --> 00:29:31.521\nI just wanna filter it out.\n\n546\n00:29:31.521 --> 00:29:34.883\nSo what you can do is you can turn on and\noff these checkboxes.\n\n547\n00:29:34.883 --> 00:29:40.022\nBut the things that you have to remember\nis if I wanted to not show sleep and\n\n548\n00:29:40.022 --> 00:29:42.968\nnot show meow, to make these apply, hm,\n\n549\n00:29:42.968 --> 00:29:46.524\nwhat do you think you're\ngonna click down there?\n\n550\n00:29:46.524 --> 00:29:48.290\nYep, the Apply button.\n\n551\n00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:49.534\nApply button?\n[LAUGH] Yeah, and\n\n552\n00:29:49.534 --> 00:29:51.841\nso now you're just saying,\nI don't want part of this.\n\n553\n00:29:51.841 --> 00:29:54.666\nThis is something that we did with tables,\nright?\n\n554\n00:29:54.666 --> 00:29:57.499\nWe could say,\nI only want to see these certain things.\n\n555\n00:29:57.499 --> 00:30:01.871\nSo filtering out the information within\nyour chart, that can be really handy.\n\n556\n00:30:01.871 --> 00:30:06.194\nNow as soon as you're like, oo, wouldn't\nthat be nice to show buttons on doing\n\n557\n00:30:06.194 --> 00:30:10.581\ndifferent things, you're starting to get\ninto more pivot charts and maybe some\n\n558\n00:30:10.581 --> 00:30:14.600\nslicers and some different options\nthat we will cover in other episodes.\n\n559\n00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:18.950\nBut I at least wanted to point out those\nlittle buttons for you right there.\n\n560\n00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:23.710\nAnd I believe that covers everything\nin just some basic charts,\n\n561\n00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:27.760\ninserting it and formatting the different\npieces, and that's what I got.\n\n562\n00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:28.400\nAll right, well, Vonne,\n\n563\n00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.300\nI feel like you've at least given us\nenough to get started with charts.\n\n564\n00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:34.430\nI can actually insert a chart\nwith some data inside of it and\n\n565\n00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:35.560\nit will do something.\n\n566\n00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:37.670\nIt will look like a chart, and\nthat's always a good thing.\n\n567\n00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:39.180\nNow you can start getting your feet wet.\n\n568\n00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:40.984\nStart playing with buttons,\nclicking things, see what they do.\n\n569\n00:30:40.984 --> 00:30:45.317\nThe good news is that you can always\ncreate a practice chart that you can\n\n570\n00:30:45.317 --> 00:30:48.411\ndestroy, or\nmake as beautiful as you would like.\n\n571\n00:30:48.411 --> 00:30:52.770\nAnd Vonne has given us a lot of cool\ntools in which we can do that already.\n\n572\n00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:57.581\nSo go out there, young Excel Padawans,\nand learn and play and have a good time.\n\n573\n00:30:57.581 --> 00:31:00.374\nVonne, thanks for showing us how\nwe can play with our charts.\n\n574\n00:31:00.374 --> 00:31:02.354\nAnd I know that you've got more for\nus down the road and\n\n575\n00:31:02.354 --> 00:31:04.115\nhow we can get a little\nmore advanced with that.\n\n576\n00:31:04.115 --> 00:31:05.690\nIt's gonna be a lot of fun.\n\n577\n00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:06.900\nAnd we do thank you for joining us.\n\n578\n00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:09.840\nWe thank our audience for joining us\nas well, but guess what, everyone?\n\n579\n00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.840\nIt is that time for us to sign off.\n\n580\n00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.230\nFor OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n581\n00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:15.478\nAnd I'm Vonne Smith.\nAnd we'll see you next time.\n\n582\n00:31:15.478 --> 00:31:22.720\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

another great\nepisode of Office Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.750\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we are moving on with more in our\n\n5\n00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.230\nExcel charts and pivot table series.\n\n6\n00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.920\nIt's gonna be a lot of fun,\nand joining us in the studio,\n\n7\n00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.970\nour resident expert on that very topic,\nour one and only, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:30.780\nVonne, welcome back.\n\n9\n00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.620\nHow are you today?\n\n10\n00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.050\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic.\n\n11\n00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.760\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; We're here\n\n12\n00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.110\nto talk about creating charts\nfrom a non-contiguous data set.\n\n13\n00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.880\nAnd that's kind of a mouthful right,\n[LAUGH] yeah, yes.\n\n14\n00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.183\nIt's one of those, if you don't\nknow what non-contiguous set means.\n\n15\n00:00:44.183 --> 00:00:45.877\n&gt;&gt; Non-contigilicious what?.\n\n16\n00:00:45.877 --> 00:00:49.450\n&gt;&gt; It's a really long word like,\nI don't know what that is.\n\n17\n00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.320\nWell, have been using that particular\nphrase throughout our Excel series about\n\n18\n00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.270\na contiguous range of cells would be\nthings that are right next to each other.\n\n19\n00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.578\nThat they're all touching.\n\n20\n00:00:58.578 --> 00:01:04.100\nWell, a non-contiguous set would be\nsomething that's not next to each other.\n\n21\n00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.726\n&gt;&gt; So A1 and F13, right.\n\n22\n00:01:06.726 --> 00:01:08.846\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, yeah, so\nthey're not next to each other.\n\n23\n00:01:08.846 --> 00:01:12.557\nAnd when we were creating a basic\nchart and we went ahead and\n\n24\n00:01:12.557 --> 00:01:16.520\nsaid, look let's just select it and\npoof, it's just done.\n\n25\n00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.972\nIt doesn't always work that easily.\n\n26\n00:01:19.972 --> 00:01:22.532\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz what if I want cell A1 and\nF14, and\n\n27\n00:01:22.532 --> 00:01:26.320\nthey have two pieces of data that\nI wanna put inside of my chart.\n\n28\n00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.060\nHow the heck do I make that happen?\n\n29\n00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.625\n&gt;&gt; And that's why we've made this episode.\n\n30\n00:01:29.625 --> 00:01:30.560\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's why we're doing\n\n31\n00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.140\nthis thing, right?\n\n32\n00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.800\n&gt;&gt; That's why we're here.\n\n33\n00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.960\nSo I have a couple of different examples\nin a file that I'd like to just kinda just\n\n34\n00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.910\nrun through them to give you different\nideas of, the data's across or\n\n35\n00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:41.940\nit's down the side.\n\n36\n00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.380\nAnd, that just didn't work at all.\n\n37\n00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.360\n[LAUGH] And\ndifferent ways that I can fix it.\n\n38\n00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.880\nSo why don't we jump on\ndown into this file?\n\n39\n00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.758\nAnd just to recap from our other episode\nthat we had done where we just had to,\n\n40\n00:01:52.758 --> 00:01:56.150\nI think it was insert and\nformat a basic chart.\n\n41\n00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.700\nWe took this data right here,\nwe selected it, we went to Insert.\n\n42\n00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.680\nWe said cluster column chart and\nthen poof there it is.\n\n43\n00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.980\nWe got everything right there.\n\n44\n00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.640\nWe got our Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,\nFuego, Bishop cuz all of the labels that I\n\n45\n00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.770\nwanted for my series, that would be\nlike Fuego, Bishop, Pumpkin, and Puma.\n\n46\n00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.320\nThose are our series and\nthen the category,\n\n47\n00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.680\nthat's our horizontal axis is across\nthe bottom, it just knew to go ahead and\n\n48\n00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.820\njust pick it all and\nit was easy and it was fine.\n\n49\n00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.106\nAnd well, great,\nwhat if it's not like that?\n\n50\n00:02:27.106 --> 00:02:32.011\nSo let's say I want to chart our daily\ntotals, all right, so this is where I want\n\n51\n00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:37.153\nto say what are the totals for Monday,\nTuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.\n\n52\n00:02:37.153 --> 00:02:41.840\nSo this is only gonna be one series.\n\n53\n00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.970\nIt's not going to be multiples where\nwe have Fuego and Bishop and Pumpkin.\n\n54\n00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.230\nIt's just gonna be the daily totals.\n\n55\n00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.880\nIt's easier if we go ahead and\njust visualize it and see it.\n\n56\n00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.710\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nselect Daily Totals.\n\n57\n00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.130\nAnd I am grabbing this cuz\nit does have a label here.\n\n58\n00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.040\nSo, grab that.\n\n59\n00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.137\nAnd if I say Insert &gt;\nCluster column chart.\n\n60\n00:03:04.137 --> 00:03:05.940\nAll right, well, it's doing it.\n\n61\n00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.558\nAnd I can say that this is Monday,\nTuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.\n\n62\n00:03:09.558 --> 00:03:12.940\nBut it just says, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\n63\n00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.080\nIt doesn't actually give like the days,\nthe week.\n\n64\n00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.547\nI'm just gonna move down just a little\nbit so we can kinda see that.\n\n65\n00:03:20.547 --> 00:03:24.505\nSo it's close but not all the way.\n\n66\n00:03:24.505 --> 00:03:30.285\nSo I need to be able to modify\nthe data that's in this chart.\n\n67\n00:03:30.285 --> 00:03:33.675\nSo we've talked about this Select Data\nbutton that we went to a couple times\n\n68\n00:03:33.675 --> 00:03:34.285\nin the episode.\n\n69\n00:03:34.285 --> 00:03:36.795\nBut now we're gonna really\nkinda come into this a lot.\n\n70\n00:03:36.795 --> 00:03:42.110\nBecause this is where the only series\nthat I have are the daily totals, and\n\n71\n00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.910\nit's telling me that, and it's actually\nputting that in the chart title.\n\n72\n00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.957\nSo that's fine, but this category access,\nit just says 1, 2, 3, 4,\n\n73\n00:03:49.957 --> 00:03:55.060\n5, so I need to go out,\ninto my worksheet somewhere and\n\n74\n00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.460\ntell it, where are the category labels,\nwhere do they live.\n\n75\n00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.960\nWell it's the Monday, Tuesday,\nWednesday, Thursday, Friday.\n\n76\n00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.410\nSo you're just gonna come over\nhere to your category axis.\n\n77\n00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.120\nYou're gonna click Edit.\n\n78\n00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.300\nAnd now it says, well,\ntell me where this is.\n\n79\n00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.180\nI have a cursor in that box.\n\n80\n00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.630\nYou just take your white plus sign and\nyou select the cells.\n\n81\n00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.610\nAnd, look at there, now it went ahead and\nlabelled everything I needed to do.\n\n82\n00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.519\nSo sometimes you have to kinda force\nthe information because the labels weren't\n\n83\n00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:27.600\nright next to it in that contiguous range.\n\n84\n00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.700\nIt's non-contiguous so I had to come\nin here and fix it a little bit.\n\n85\n00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.129\nSo that's the easiest way\nthat we can do that and\n\n86\n00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:36.844\nit is exactly what I needed to do.\n\n87\n00:04:36.844 --> 00:04:41.200\nIf I click OK now I have my chart.\n\n88\n00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.029\nSometimes just to make sure that yeah\nthis is the actual information that I'm\n\n89\n00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:49.223\nwanting to have, what I'll do,\nI'll go ahead and\n\n90\n00:04:49.223 --> 00:04:53.782\nput on a data table with that and\njust double check, whoops okay, undo.\n\n91\n00:04:53.782 --> 00:04:58.329\nYeah that's 1, 40, 56,\nyeah it's pulling the right information,\n\n92\n00:04:58.329 --> 00:05:02.510\nbecause sometimes when you're\nlooking at just the visuals.\n\n93\n00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.330\nIt's like, is that actually right?\n\n94\n00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.430\nI wanna make sure.\n\n95\n00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.250\nSo putting on that data table can\nalways confirm that with you.\n\n96\n00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:15.330\nAnd then now I have it right across here,\nand since it has things like $104.13,\n\n97\n00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.560\nit's probably good to put that data table\non there so it has the actual value in it.\n\n98\n00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.960\n&gt;&gt; So Vaughan, really quick question here,\n\n99\n00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.390\nyou've got your cool little chart\ngoing on, and you're grabbing data.\n\n100\n00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.550\nFrom all over your spreadsheet in\nExcel and it's non-contiguous,\n\n101\n00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.160\nbecause that's the whole\npurpose of this show.\n\n102\n00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.050\nIf I wanted to just grab anything,\n\n103\n00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.510\nare we basically just watching\nthe same thing over and over again?\n\n104\n00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.470\nWe're doing the same steps to do that?\n\n105\n00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:40.600\nIs that what happens?\n\n106\n00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.988\n&gt;&gt; I think what you're asking is can\nI just grab some of these cells and\n\n107\n00:05:43.988 --> 00:05:46.784\ngrab some of these cells and\njust make a chart out of it?\n\n108\n00:05:46.784 --> 00:05:50.675\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if I had a spreadsheet\nthat had attributes of people,\n\n109\n00:05:50.675 --> 00:05:55.250\nVonne, on one side, and\nDaniel on the other, size, weight, shape,\n\n110\n00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.338\ncolor, hair, no hair, I'm losing mine but.\n\n111\n00:05:58.338 --> 00:06:00.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We wanted to compare that,\n\n112\n00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.930\nput it in a chart.\n\n113\n00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.750\nI should be able to grab whatever\nI want and make that a chart.\n\n114\n00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.410\n&gt;&gt; Well, charts have to make sense.\n\n115\n00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I mean they have to be, all right,\n\n116\n00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.386\nwell this is making the daily totals.\n\n117\n00:06:11.386 --> 00:06:15.230\nWhen I was grabbing the Monday, Tuesday,\nWednesday, that's really connected\n\n118\n00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.630\nto the data that I was wanting to chart,\nwhich was really the daily totals.\n\n119\n00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.720\nAnd it was really more just\nthe labels that were associated with\n\n120\n00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:23.420\nthat information.\n\n121\n00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.670\nSo it was really kind of within the same\nthing that I wanted to display.\n\n122\n00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.970\nIt just wasn't as easy as poof it just\nput everything in the right spot.\n\n123\n00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.730\n&gt;&gt; Right, so all that data has to\nactually be connected to something.\n\n124\n00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.840\nThat makes sense within that context.\n\n125\n00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I guess that's where,\nI mean you could pull these numbers and\n\n126\n00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.520\nthese numbers, and add this, and add this.\n\n127\n00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.875\nAnd then you're gonna have a chart\nthat makes absolutely no sense.\n\n128\n00:06:42.875 --> 00:06:44.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It might be fun.\n\n129\n00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right, it'll do it.\n\n130\n00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.500\nAnd then it's like right, and\nI think that's the whole idea of a chart\n\n131\n00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.020\nis it's supposed to speak something\nthat makes sense with the data.\n\n132\n00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.760\nIf you're just saying,\nlet's compare apples and oranges.\n\n133\n00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.810\nI mean, that doesn't make any sense.\n\n134\n00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:02.780\nIt'll still do it.\n\n135\n00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.860\nCuz if you're like, put in these\nnumbers and put in these numbers,\n\n136\n00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.160\nit's gonna make chart values.\n\n137\n00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:06.760\nI mean, it'll do that.\n\n138\n00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.885\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna be the coolest\nchart in the world.\n\n139\n00:07:08.885 --> 00:07:11.335\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, then it's just gonna\nbecome a piece of abstract art.\n\n140\n00:07:11.335 --> 00:07:12.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n141\n00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:16.850\ncoming back to what you were saying,\nI have all of these people.\n\n142\n00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:21.330\nLet's say I have this sample population,\nand we did eye color and weight and hair.\n\n143\n00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.620\nAnd how many people have blue eyes and\nare over six foot?\n\n144\n00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.090\nI think what you're\ngoing to that is you're\n\n145\n00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.830\nkind of going into where we're\ngetting into pivot tables.\n\n146\n00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:33.240\nPivot tables and pivot charts and\nthen we can chart those values.\n\n147\n00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.549\nBut that's where you start doing\nmultiple axis if you want to say and\n\n148\n00:07:37.549 --> 00:07:38.765\nmultiple groups.\n\n149\n00:07:38.765 --> 00:07:39.920\n&gt;&gt; Fancy.\n&gt;&gt; It's really cool.\n\n150\n00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.840\nPivot tables are amazing, and I'm pretty\nsure that's where you wanting to go.\n\n151\n00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.610\n&gt;&gt; Okay, okay.\n\n152\n00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.230\n&gt;&gt; So [LAUGH] so, yes,\nI hear what you're saying.\n\n153\n00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:50.470\nSo, the chart does need to make sense.\n\n154\n00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.770\nAnd I have more of couple examples.\n\n155\n00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:56.218\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; That maybe we'll see it is kind of\n\n156\n00:07:56.218 --> 00:08:01.318\nthe same idea, but it's different\nplaces of where the information are.\n\n157\n00:08:01.318 --> 00:08:03.084\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; It's like Google Maps, right.\n\n158\n00:08:03.084 --> 00:08:04.583\nIt gives you four different\nways to get there.\n\n159\n00:08:04.583 --> 00:08:07.184\nDo you wanna save time, or\nis mileage important to you?\n\n160\n00:08:07.184 --> 00:08:08.093\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n161\n00:08:08.093 --> 00:08:11.950\nactually the thing that I just did where\nit's like, okay, we grab the daily totals.\n\n162\n00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:15.400\nAnd I said, I needed the labels,\nI had to put the category axis,\n\n163\n00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.770\nI had to grab that from someone where\ncuz they weren't next to each other.\n\n164\n00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:21.485\nThat's just one part, but\n\n165\n00:08:21.485 --> 00:08:26.085\nthen some of these other examples,\nif I have to select it all that first and\n\n166\n00:08:26.085 --> 00:08:29.650\nthen made the chart, it would have just\ndid the whole poof, look, it's done.\n\n167\n00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:31.815\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] As Justin says,\nthe hand wave, right?\n\n168\n00:08:31.815 --> 00:08:32.865\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n169\n00:08:32.865 --> 00:08:35.895\nSo let's keep going and\nlet me see where we can go, and\n\n170\n00:08:35.895 --> 00:08:38.305\nif that answers your questions\nI'll let you in a little bit more.\n\n171\n00:08:38.305 --> 00:08:39.505\nBut I hear what you're saying.\n\n172\n00:08:39.505 --> 00:08:42.153\n&gt;&gt; You're picking up\nwhat I'm putting down?\n\n173\n00:08:42.153 --> 00:08:42.661\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n174\n00:08:42.661 --> 00:08:43.601\n[LAUGH] It's gotta make\n\n175\n00:08:43.601 --> 00:08:44.516\nsense.\nSome-\n\n176\n00:08:44.516 --> 00:08:45.036\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, totally.\n\n177\n00:08:45.036 --> 00:08:45.544\n&gt;&gt; how, so.\n\n178\n00:08:45.544 --> 00:08:48.186\n[LAUGH] All right, so why don't we come\n\n179\n00:08:48.186 --> 00:08:51.916\nover here to our quarterly sales.\nSo I have a different worksheet now.\n\n180\n00:08:51.916 --> 00:08:53.916\nAnd this is one to where you see they've\n\n181\n00:08:53.916 --> 00:08:57.456\ndecided to organize this information,\nwhere we have our sales reps and\n\n182\n00:08:57.456 --> 00:09:00.116\nwe have January.\nBut then, we have a column of whether or\n\n183\n00:09:00.116 --> 00:09:01.220\nnot they made a bonus.\n\n184\n00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:04.300\nAnd I believe here,\nI think I just arbitrarily said okay,\n\n185\n00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.420\nif they made $500, then they get\na little x in the bonus column.\n\n186\n00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:12.190\nSo if I was gonna chart that, if I just\nselected all of this and said here,\n\n187\n00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:16.860\nlet's just go ahead and insert chart,\nit's gonna be like I bonus, what?\n\n188\n00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.200\nI mean, and this getting,\nit's gonna do it.\n\n189\n00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah but there's no data correlating\nthere, it's just an on or off field.\n\n190\n00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:25.910\nYes or no, do they get this x.\n\n191\n00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:28.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, correct, and that's where even\n\n192\n00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:35.130\nif I selected all of this, and\nsaid here, let's go chart it,\n\n193\n00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.910\neven if it's together or\nnot together it's just gonna be like what?\n\n194\n00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:43.080\nAnd I think that's where if you're\nsaying just grab this, grab that,\n\n195\n00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:47.600\nit's gonna do something, but\nit has to kind of speak the data to you.\n\n196\n00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.300\n&gt;&gt; It might come out a little wonky.\n\n197\n00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.178\n&gt;&gt; Little wonky.\n\n198\n00:09:50.178 --> 00:09:51.164\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n\n199\n00:09:51.164 --> 00:09:52.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n200\n00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:56.010\nSo if I went here, if say here let's go\nahead and get Fuego, Bishop and Puma.\n\n201\n00:09:56.010 --> 00:10:00.950\nAnd I wanna chart their January,\nFebruary and March, totals.\n\n202\n00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:03.790\nSo I'm just gonna select them,\nholding the control key down now.\n\n203\n00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:08.600\nSo I'm selecting non-contiguous\nranges of cells but\n\n204\n00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.010\nhere it's still is in that tabular format.\n\n205\n00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:15.140\n&gt;&gt; And it still makes sense to\nthe chart and it knows that Bishop is\n\n206\n00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:20.230\nall on the same row and this number\n520653 it's all in the Bishop row.\n\n207\n00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:20.850\n&gt;&gt; Got yah.\n\n208\n00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:25.690\n&gt;&gt; If you just kinda random willy\nnilly it's gonna be like I don't see\n\n209\n00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:30.500\nthe correlation of the data so I just go\nand kind of randomly put stuff in there.\n\n210\n00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.340\n&gt;&gt; So my A1F for example, only works\nif that data makes sense to each other.\n\n211\n00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:35.020\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; Got you.\n\n212\n00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.310\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there you go.\n\n213\n00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:41.396\nSo here, like our B, D and E,\nwell that's not E that's F.\n\n214\n00:10:41.396 --> 00:10:43.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Columns, they do correlate,\n\n215\n00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.260\nbecause that's what's going on here.\n\n216\n00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:49.080\nIf I go to insert, and\nwe'll go with a cluster column chart.\n\n217\n00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.255\nSo now you can see that well,\nthat didn't really work either.\n\n218\n00:10:52.255 --> 00:10:54.220\n[LAUGH] But that's okay.\n\n219\n00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:58.242\nWe're getting closer to the fact that if\nwe start trying to select multiple things\n\n220\n00:10:58.242 --> 00:11:02.280\nlike, let's just go ahead and do it,\nwell, it didn't really understand.\n\n221\n00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:07.590\nBecause if you think about it\nI have five here, five rows.\n\n222\n00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:08.920\nThis is only four.\n\n223\n00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.480\nSo it doesn't understand what's going on.\n\n224\n00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.080\nSo sometimes you have to kinda\nsacrifice that information.\n\n225\n00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.980\nIf I just said, all right, well,\nlet's go ahead and do Fuego here.\n\n226\n00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:21.250\nAnd, here, let's go ahead and\nget the right key on there.\n\n227\n00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:22.020\n&gt;&gt; Control key, right?\n\n228\n00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.090\n&gt;&gt; There we go, yep.\n\n229\n00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:25.060\nWe'll have that selected.\n\n230\n00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:27.670\nAnd I go to insert this chart.\n\n231\n00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:30.480\nNow you can see,\nthere it's making the data.\n\n232\n00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.630\nThere's the Fuego, Bishop, Puma and\nPumpkin, in the wrong order.\n\n233\n00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:36.490\nAnd then throw that data table on there.\n\n234\n00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:38.060\nYep those are the values.\n\n235\n00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.300\nBut the series, now it's understanding it.\n\n236\n00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.070\nSo now let me go back and\nget those series.\n\n237\n00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:47.140\nSo this is pretty much the same\nidea that we had before, but\n\n238\n00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:50.780\nthis is where, okay,\nwhen we have these series.\n\n239\n00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:52.060\nSo this is Fuego.\n\n240\n00:11:53.080 --> 00:12:00.250\nAnd series one, that's really going to be,\nif we look at that, let's see here.\n\n241\n00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:03.490\nOkay, so series one, that's gonna be what?\n\n242\n00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:04.880\nThat's January.\n\n243\n00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.874\nSee?\nThe 312, 502, for, wait, there.\n\n244\n00:12:08.874 --> 00:12:11.791\n[SOUND] This is [LAUGH].\n\n245\n00:12:11.791 --> 00:12:13.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, Series 1.\n\n246\n00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:16.080\nThat's going to be January, right.\n\n247\n00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.870\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz that's,\n\n248\n00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:19.036\nsee how this can get really confusing?\n\n249\n00:12:19.036 --> 00:12:19.910\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah totally.\n\n250\n00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:21.090\n&gt;&gt; But we've got that.\n\n251\n00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:24.720\nSo now we have to say Series 1 is January.\n\n252\n00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.960\nIt's not February, it's January,\n&gt;&gt; It's just January.\n\n253\n00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:27.870\n&gt;&gt; Those are the numbers.\n\n254\n00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:30.850\nSo we're going to have to edit\nthis particular series one,\n\n255\n00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:34.780\nand we're gonna say that that is\nthe January, and then there you go.\n\n256\n00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.730\nNow we've got the numbers correct.\n\n257\n00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:38.970\nSo now the series, series 2.\n\n258\n00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:42.560\nAnd you don't go out and\nselect ranges in series.\n\n259\n00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.720\nThere's only one.\n\n260\n00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.600\nSo we're gonna say let's get series 2 and\nsay that is February.\n\n261\n00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.130\nSo we're selecting the column header.\n\n262\n00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:54.000\nAnd then series 3, edit,\nwe come over here to March.\n\n263\n00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.250\nAnd then we click OK and\n\n264\n00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:59.510\nthen now we have a chart that is-\n&gt;&gt; Voila.\n\n265\n00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:03.100\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's the January\n&gt;&gt; For, yes, okay.\n\n266\n00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:05.098\nSee, and this is where\nthe numbers were going across.\n\n267\n00:13:05.098 --> 00:13:06.310\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] checkoff.\n&gt;&gt; Now they're going down.\n\n268\n00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:07.590\n&gt;&gt; Now they're going sideways, yeah, yeah.\n\n269\n00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:09.325\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Totally it'll mess you up.\n\n270\n00:13:09.325 --> 00:13:10.450\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It will really mess you up.\n\n271\n00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:12.710\nAnd that's where you gotta\nput that data table on.\n\n272\n00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:14.960\nAnd I need to make sure that I'm matching.\n\n273\n00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:19.560\nOkay, so January, yep,\nthere's Fuego, there's Bishop,\n\n274\n00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:20.990\nthere's Puma and there's Pumpkin.\n\n275\n00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:22.320\nOK, I really wanna switch those around.\n\n276\n00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH ]\n\n277\n00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:24.520\n&gt;&gt; Then of course\n\n278\n00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.980\nwe always have this button right here.\n\n279\n00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:29.320\nNow we've switched it to\nwhere there's our January.\n\n280\n00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.470\nAnd now it's actually--\n&gt;&gt; It looks a whole lot more like our\n\n281\n00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:34.300\nactual data inside of our spreadsheet.\n\n282\n00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:34.830\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n283\n00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:38.020\nAnd that's where sometimes you\nhave to turn your brain around,\n\n284\n00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.735\nit hurts a little bit.\n\n285\n00:13:39.735 --> 00:13:41.190\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's where,\n\n286\n00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:43.600\neven if you're saying let's just go\nahead and grab this all together.\n\n287\n00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.550\nIt doesn't always work that way.\n\n288\n00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:49.780\nYou can't just grab it and then just say\nhere, let's go ahead and throw it in.\n\n289\n00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:54.230\nYou really have to think about\nwhat do I want to display.\n\n290\n00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:57.430\nAnd knowing what is a series,\nwhat is a category and\n\n291\n00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:59.040\nthen honestly sometimes flipping it.\n\n292\n00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:02.620\nIf we just flip that from a very\nbeginning and it turn it around and\n\n293\n00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.350\nthen like I just wanna go ahead and grab-\n&gt;&gt; Because\n\n294\n00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:07.633\nyour brain just lines everything up and\nI'll set you're in business.\n\n295\n00:14:07.633 --> 00:14:11.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it takes a while and\nthat's why I wanna kinda give you\n\n296\n00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.567\na couple different demonstration I\neven got a little like what am I.\n\n297\n00:14:14.567 --> 00:14:15.876\n&gt;&gt; What is going on.\n\n298\n00:14:15.876 --> 00:14:17.880\n&gt;&gt; What did I just do.\n\n299\n00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.070\nIt happens sometimes.\n\n300\n00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:22.310\nSo just knowing What you\nneed to put as your labels.\n\n301\n00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:23.630\nThey might not be next to each other.\n\n302\n00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:28.430\nAnd where to go and find it within\nthat select data dialogue box.\n\n303\n00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:30.680\nSo that's always good here.\n\n304\n00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.130\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's move this all right, and\n\n305\n00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:36.290\nwe just still format it just the same way\nthat we did with all of our other charts.\n\n306\n00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.710\nLet's go back over to,\nlet's do another example here.\n\n307\n00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:42.800\nCuz this goes along the same premise,\n\n308\n00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.990\nwhat if I wanted to chart\nthe monthly totals, right.\n\n309\n00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:48.290\nSo, if I wanted to take these.\n\n310\n00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:53.000\nI wanna take this one,\nhold the control key and select those and\n\n311\n00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.910\nthen insert that chart.\n\n312\n00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:58.570\nYou know, this is where I if I try to say,\nhoo here let's go ahead and grab all the.\n\n313\n00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:00.220\nCause these are the labels right?\n\n314\n00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:01.080\nThat would make sense?\n\n315\n00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:01.730\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it does.\n\n316\n00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:03.345\n&gt;&gt; It does, in our brain.\n\n317\n00:15:03.345 --> 00:15:04.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; But its like, no.\n\n318\n00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:05.840\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n319\n00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:06.980\n&gt;&gt; That's the ridiculous term.\n\n320\n00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:07.812\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n321\n00:15:07.812 --> 00:15:09.650\nAnd I think we just gonna\ngo back to the point.\n\n322\n00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:11.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Cause you know, I gonna go through.\n\n323\n00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.290\nOkay, well I can't get all in one shot but\nthese are.\n\n324\n00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:17.250\nWait that's wrong key.\n\n325\n00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:21.990\nThese are the values\nthat I want to chart out.\n\n326\n00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:23.510\nSo I'll go ahead and put that in.\n\n327\n00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:28.230\nNow, I need to go back and put that this\nis January, February, March, and April.\n\n328\n00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:29.710\nAgain, going back to that data.\n\n329\n00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:34.700\nNow it's on the horizontal axis and if I\njust click edit, I can't just drag across.\n\n330\n00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:35.390\nOkay?\n\n331\n00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:37.710\nCuz it was every other column.\n\n332\n00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:39.670\nAnd I'm kinda moving these\nthings around a little bit.\n\n333\n00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:40.380\nHold that control.\n\n334\n00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:42.870\nA single click once, hold the Ctrl key.\n\n335\n00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:45.230\nIt's February, March, and April but\n\n336\n00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:49.690\nit's following that same pattern\nof I did one, two, three, four.\n\n337\n00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:53.870\nYou come across, you click OK and\nthen it goes ahead and puts it down there.\n\n338\n00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:56.740\nAnd that's exactly what I wanted it to do.\n\n339\n00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:57.745\n&gt;&gt; Kinda sweet.\n\n340\n00:15:57.745 --> 00:16:01.898\n&gt;&gt; Right, if you just kinda\nhave to slow down, think about.\n\n341\n00:16:01.898 --> 00:16:03.978\nAnd you can still switch it.\n\n342\n00:16:03.978 --> 00:16:06.192\nIf I did this cuz that\nisn't the monthly total.\n\n343\n00:16:06.192 --> 00:16:10.630\nAnd it's really different ways of showing\nthe same data, like here's January,\n\n344\n00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:12.378\nFebruary, March, and April.\n\n345\n00:16:12.378 --> 00:16:15.651\nFlip it around, January,\nFebruary, March, and April,\n\n346\n00:16:15.651 --> 00:16:19.860\nit's just which way you want the columns\nto kinda line up next to each other.\n\n347\n00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:20.990\nSo there you go.\n\n348\n00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:26.540\nAnd then let's come back over\nhere to our weekly sales data.\n\n349\n00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:30.970\nWe did some of these things here I wanted\nto just show you how you can add in data\n\n350\n00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:33.640\nto a chart that's already created.\n\n351\n00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:38.891\nSo let's move this guy over here I'm\njust gonna kinda move this down,\n\n352\n00:16:38.891 --> 00:16:43.342\nhere we go and, I'm going to grab,\nlet's see, this one.\n\n353\n00:16:43.342 --> 00:16:44.878\nWe're going to just make a normal chart.\n\n354\n00:16:44.878 --> 00:16:50.420\nOkay, we're gonna take this, we're going\nto insert a regular cluster column chart.\n\n355\n00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:54.040\nAnd that was, cuz everything's next to\neach other, right, Monday, Tuesday,\n\n356\n00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.650\nWednesday, Thursday,\nFuego, Bishop and Puma.\n\n357\n00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:59.325\nBut I realize, I forgot Saturday, okay?\n\n358\n00:16:59.325 --> 00:17:04.137\nAnd I put this way out over here\njust to kind of demonstrate\n\n359\n00:17:04.137 --> 00:17:07.755\nthe point of I need to\nadd Saturday into it.\n\n360\n00:17:07.755 --> 00:17:10.330\nCuz maybe I have my\nweekend totals over here.\n\n361\n00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:14.510\nAnd it's still gonna want to,\nit's still saying that there's Fuego.\n\n362\n00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:22.060\nFuego is on row six, Bishop is on seven,\nPumpkin is on eight, Puma is on nine.\n\n363\n00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:26.360\nAnd so\nall of that data is the same Organization.\n\n364\n00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:30.460\nSo if I wanted to grab this in here,\nwatch if I select this.\n\n365\n00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:34.925\nAnd it also knows that the category\nlabel's coming from row five.\n\n366\n00:17:34.925 --> 00:17:39.140\nIf I just copy that, just regular copy,\nclick on the chart, and\n\n367\n00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:42.580\nthen paste it,\nit just puts it right in there.\n\n368\n00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:43.810\nSo here we go.\n\n369\n00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:45.390\nLet me just go ahead and add that in.\n\n370\n00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:51.431\nAnd if I add my data table back in there\nto make sure that everything is working.\n\n371\n00:17:51.431 --> 00:17:55.986\nYep, that's pulling it because of\nthe way that the data is organized.\n\n372\n00:17:55.986 --> 00:17:59.240\nNow that was somewhere else like\nsome weird space out there.\n\n373\n00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:02.790\nIt's gonna be like, I can't follow\nthe pattern, it has to find a pattern.\n\n374\n00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:07.004\nSo it needs to understand this is all\nconnected together with each other.\n\n375\n00:18:07.004 --> 00:18:11.470\nSo that is kind of a fun little way of,\nI forgot just a little piece.\n\n376\n00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:15.142\nIt's all the same way as all the other\ndata is but it's going to work in.\n\n377\n00:18:15.142 --> 00:18:18.436\n&gt;&gt; It really makes you reconsider\nthe way that you put your\n\n378\n00:18:18.436 --> 00:18:21.880\ndata together inside of your\nExcel worksheets, right?\n\n379\n00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.826\nBecause if you don't think ahead and\n\n380\n00:18:23.826 --> 00:18:27.732\nthink, I'm going to have those\nweekend totals, I totally forgot.\n\n381\n00:18:27.732 --> 00:18:29.961\nWell, I'll just slap them over\nhere in the right hand bottom.\n\n382\n00:18:29.961 --> 00:18:33.305\nYeah, you can do that, but you're not\ngoing to be able to work with your charts\n\n383\n00:18:33.305 --> 00:18:35.241\nbecause it's not all organized correctly.\n\n384\n00:18:35.241 --> 00:18:38.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean if you had Monday,\nTuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,\n\n385\n00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:39.764\nFriday in different.\n\n386\n00:18:39.764 --> 00:18:43.721\nLike they were kind of, you know like\nsubway tiles that kind of go like this?\n\n387\n00:18:43.721 --> 00:18:49.808\nThen you can grab it, but it looks at the\ncolumn references and the row references.\n\n388\n00:18:49.808 --> 00:18:53.449\nIt really needs to understand\nthat continuity around it.\n\n389\n00:18:53.449 --> 00:18:57.937\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it takes that data out of it's\ncontext if it's not in the same context as\n\n390\n00:18:57.937 --> 00:18:59.284\nall the other data is.\n\n391\n00:18:59.284 --> 00:19:04.080\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah and it can be a little,\nit can throw you off pretty quickly so.\n\n392\n00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.025\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know.\n\n393\n00:19:05.025 --> 00:19:06.037\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n394\n00:19:06.037 --> 00:19:07.969\n&gt;&gt; This is why me and Excel we don't vibe.\n\n395\n00:19:07.969 --> 00:19:09.903\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm like I didn't know you were\n\n396\n00:19:09.903 --> 00:19:10.432\nlike this.\n\n397\n00:19:10.432 --> 00:19:13.905\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\nit can be a little strange.\n\n398\n00:19:13.905 --> 00:19:20.501\nSo it's just, and you have to have,\nlike what you're talking about.\n\n399\n00:19:20.501 --> 00:19:22.565\nCharts can do charting, but\n\n400\n00:19:22.565 --> 00:19:28.328\nif you're wanting to go to that next level\nof all of these multiple data points.\n\n401\n00:19:28.328 --> 00:19:31.091\n&gt;&gt; Just random stuff that's\nnot necessarily connected.\n\n402\n00:19:31.091 --> 00:19:37.011\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or I need to see how many\nsales people, the amount of units sold\n\n403\n00:19:37.011 --> 00:19:43.352\nby the sales people in the western\nregion for this particular product.\n\n404\n00:19:43.352 --> 00:19:47.500\nWhen you start getting those different\nthings, now you're going to a pivot table,\n\n405\n00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:48.856\ncuz you have to have those.\n\n406\n00:19:48.856 --> 00:19:50.532\nIt's almost not just like x and y.\n\n407\n00:19:50.532 --> 00:19:52.699\nIt's like x, y, z, q and r.\n\n408\n00:19:52.699 --> 00:19:53.379\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n409\n00:19:53.379 --> 00:19:55.594\n&gt;&gt; So you have to take it to the next\n\n410\n00:19:55.594 --> 00:19:56.195\nlevel.\n\n411\n00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:58.317\nJust different things of pointing it out.\n\n412\n00:19:58.317 --> 00:20:01.571\nAnd then, another one just to\nkind of have a little bit of fun.\n\n413\n00:20:01.571 --> 00:20:05.105\nIf I have, well, let's go ahead and\ncompare the Mondays.\n\n414\n00:20:05.105 --> 00:20:08.830\nBetween Monday from this week and\nthen Monday from that week.\n\n415\n00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:13.590\nNow it does have all of our labels here,\nso you got the Fuego, Bishop, Puma, and\n\n416\n00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:15.772\nPumpkin, the Pumpkin before Puma.\n\n417\n00:20:15.772 --> 00:20:18.455\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't be switching them.\n\n418\n00:20:18.455 --> 00:20:20.410\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So if I take this and\n\n419\n00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:26.170\ngo to a cluster column chart, I mean,\nit'll do it, and here's the Fuego.\n\n420\n00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:30.740\nSo you can have it to where it's\ncomparing those different pieces but\n\n421\n00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:34.410\nthen it's like you'd have to kinda\nexplain this chart a little bit more.\n\n422\n00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:35.690\nBut it'll do it.\n\n423\n00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:38.320\nIt went ahead and compared my Mondays.\n\n424\n00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.150\n&gt;&gt; There they are.\n\n425\n00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:41.700\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nSo and if I switched this rows and column,\n\n426\n00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.130\nokay, well there's our other Mondays.\n\n427\n00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:47.490\nAnd if I add our legend on there,\nwe'll put our legend.\n\n428\n00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:50.880\nBut see then it's like wait,\nwhat color's Fuego again?\n\n429\n00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.420\nSo there's that kind of, all right.\n\n430\n00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:54.140\n&gt;&gt; DIsconnect.\n\n431\n00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:55.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.\n\n432\n00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:59.420\nIt gets to a certain point,\nwhat I would do is just make two charts.\n\n433\n00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.210\nHere's one chart, here's another chart.\n\n434\n00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:05.140\nAnd that starts to get into\nwhat people call dashboards.\n\n435\n00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:06.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, totally.\n\n436\n00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:08.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, where a dashboard will\njust show you all this stuff.\n\n437\n00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.670\n&gt;&gt; Any time you have like\na central command kind of thing,\n\n438\n00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:11.820\ndashboards all the rage.\n\n439\n00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:12.690\nWe love them.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n440\n00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:14.215\n&gt;&gt; It just makes it easy to look at data.\n\n441\n00:21:14.215 --> 00:21:15.770\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, well, if you think about it.\n\n442\n00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:17.100\nThey're really just charts.\n\n443\n00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.950\nIt's just a summary of everything.\n\n444\n00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:21.470\nWell if I take this,\nthen we could move charts.\n\n445\n00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:23.850\nIf I made an,\nlet's make a new worksheet just for fun.\n\n446\n00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:27.440\nAnd if I took this and\nsaid all right let's take this and\n\n447\n00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.800\nlet's go over to design.\n\n448\n00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:34.640\nAnd we can move the chart over into the,\nwhat have I called, the sheet one.\n\n449\n00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:38.505\nSo okay well then here is the, watch\nit'll probably put the title on here.\n\n450\n00:21:38.505 --> 00:21:42.280\n[LAUGH] Where we have this one and then\nI could say well then here's our monthly\n\n451\n00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:45.760\ntotals, here's our weekly sales,\nour daily totals.\n\n452\n00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.640\nI can just go ahead now,\n\n453\n00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:52.320\nwith all these different examples I've\nkind of forgotten what they all meant.\n\n454\n00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.810\nBut they mean something in\na sense to where I can say-\n\n455\n00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:55.480\n&gt;&gt; And like you said,\n\n456\n00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.680\nif you had titled them totally made\nsense you wouldn't have to remember.\n\n457\n00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:00.990\n&gt;&gt; Yes, if I had gone through and\ncompleted the entire set.\n\n458\n00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:02.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is just examples.\n\n459\n00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.060\n&gt;&gt; But now it's just all in one sheet.\n\n460\n00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:06.550\nSo let's come back over here to well,\n\n461\n00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:09.390\nlet's have a quarterly sales\nto where it was 3,000.\n\n462\n00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:13.300\nI had a typo, that changed all my data.\n\n463\n00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:17.040\nCome over here to our weekly\nsales was like this was $450.\n\n464\n00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:21.420\nChanged everything,\nwell that changes everything on my charts.\n\n465\n00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:25.310\nIt's all pulling from the same\ninformation so you get all these setup.\n\n466\n00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:28.490\nChange the values in it, do all those\nother things we did in all of our other\n\n467\n00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:31.370\nepisodes where you can lock down your\ncells and validate everything and\n\n468\n00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:32.950\nthen just pulls it all together.\n\n469\n00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:38.960\nAnd it's really just charts, but you have\nto think out what your charts need to say.\n\n470\n00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.620\nAnd sometimes the information\nthat you need to\n\n471\n00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:44.570\nlabel your charts isn't\nalways next to each other.\n\n472\n00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:48.650\nSo that's why knowing how\nto go that select data,\n\n473\n00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:51.510\nunderstanding what a category access is.\n\n474\n00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:55.060\nUnderstanding that I can only have\none label on my series that these\n\n475\n00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:55.730\nkinda correlate.\n\n476\n00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:57.940\nSometimes I like flip them around.\n\n477\n00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:03.510\nOkay that's what we're getting, it's\na little bit of a learning process and\n\n478\n00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:08.670\nyou have to kind of think about it,\nand this data versus your data, it's\n\n479\n00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:12.650\nsometimes takes a while to kind of come\nback around full circle and understand it.\n\n480\n00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:13.500\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n481\n00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.360\nWell Vaughna I'm here to tell you right\nnow I have actually learned something\n\n482\n00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:17.690\ntoday about Excel.\n\n483\n00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:19.320\nAnd it was no small feat.\n\n484\n00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.770\nAnd we do appreciate your time and\neffort in doing that.\n\n485\n00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:23.300\nAt least, I know I sure do.\n\n486\n00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.685\nI'm sure you guys do as well.\n\n487\n00:23:24.685 --> 00:23:27.490\nVaughan, you did a great job of\nexplaining how we can use charts and\n\n488\n00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:29.610\neven create the cool dashboard stuff.\n\n489\n00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:31.300\nI liked that, that was actually very cool.\n\n490\n00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:32.650\nWe appreciate it.\n\n491\n00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:34.690\nAnd go use that in your environment.\n\n492\n00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:36.950\nSet up your own dashboard or\nmake a chart that you need to so\n\n493\n00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:39.590\nthat you can keep an eye on things.\n\n494\n00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:40.820\nWhen it comes to your data.\n\n495\n00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:43.132\nBut, speaking of keeping an eye on things.\n\n496\n00:23:43.132 --> 00:23:44.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Looking at our clock, and\n\n497\n00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:47.276\nit's letting me know, yep,\nwe are out of time for today.\n\n498\n00:23:47.276 -->

00:00:23.100\nwell, it's more in our Excel charts and\npivot table series.\n\n7\n00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.770\nAnd joining us back in the studio again,\nour lovely friend, Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.670\nVonne, we're always so glad to have you\nin the studio, and how's it going today?\n\n9\n00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.960\n&gt;&gt; It's pietastic.\n\n10\n00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.020\n&gt;&gt; Ooh.\n&gt;&gt; Ooh.\n\n11\n00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.690\n&gt;&gt; Pie within a pietastic?\n\n12\n00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.782\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna go there too.\n\n13\n00:00:34.782 --> 00:00:38.320\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we're here to create a pie chart.\n\n14\n00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.930\nYay.\n\n15\n00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.500\nSo we're talking about blueberry and\ncherry pies.\n\n16\n00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.638\n&gt;&gt; I'm ready to eat.\n\n17\n00:00:43.638 --> 00:00:46.110\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, I'm totally ready for that so\n\n18\n00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.770\nI like some apple pie with some ice cream.\n\n19\n00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.205\n&gt;&gt; I didn't get this big looking at pie,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n20\n00:00:51.205 --> 00:00:54.348\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're going to go ahead and create one,\n\n21\n00:00:54.348 --> 00:00:58.876\nlike we said, and there's some different\nways that we can select the data, and\n\n22\n00:00:58.876 --> 00:01:02.607\nmaybe be able to select some labels\nthat aren't right next to it.\n\n23\n00:01:02.607 --> 00:01:05.295\nWe talked about this in our\nnoncontiguous data episode,\n\n24\n00:01:05.295 --> 00:01:08.487\nwhich we really got the whole point down,\nthat needs to make sense,\n\n25\n00:01:08.487 --> 00:01:12.170\nand we're just going to make sure\nthat we pull everything together.\n\n26\n00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.530\nNow with a pie chart,\nyou can only have one series, so\n\n27\n00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.490\nif you think about a pie, we have a whole\npie and then you have pieces of the pie.\n\n28\n00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.710\nNow, is somebody taking a pie piece\nthat's this big, or this big, but\n\n29\n00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.920\nit's all part of one whole.\n\n30\n00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.990\nSo, that's how you have to kind of\nbreak it down, you can't say all right,\n\n31\n00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.880\nwe're going to go ahead and have Fuego,\nBishop and Puma's sales for\n\n32\n00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.720\nJanuary February, and March,\nthat's not a pie chart.\n\n33\n00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.430\nThat would be, like, a clustered column\nchart, the way we've been doing.\n\n34\n00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.540\nSo you do need to kind of think about it.\n\n35\n00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.100\nIf I wanna have January and\nFebruary, it's the percentage or\n\n36\n00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.590\nthe pieces of the pie of January.\n\n37\n00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.060\nYou could have a February pie.\n\n38\n00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.510\nBut that would be a separate pie chart.\n\n39\n00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.038\nSo you just have to kind\nof get in that mind set of,\n\n40\n00:01:59.038 --> 00:02:01.430\nyou're only gonna be doing one thing.\n\n41\n00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.620\nLike parts of a hole.\n\n42\n00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.560\n&gt;&gt; Context is king throughout Excel.\n\n43\n00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.670\n&gt;&gt; Always, yes.\n\n44\n00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.486\nAnd I think in life too, right?\n\n45\n00:02:09.486 --> 00:02:09.992\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, probably.\n\n46\n00:02:09.992 --> 00:02:11.320\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Somewhere along that line.\n\n47\n00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.870\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you can get some stuff real messed\nup, you put it in the wrong context.\n\n48\n00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.271\n&gt;&gt; That's, we know all about that.\n\n49\n00:02:16.271 --> 00:02:19.402\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes we do, yes we do.\n\n50\n00:02:19.402 --> 00:02:23.580\n&gt;&gt; So I have a file called pie chart.xlsx\n&gt;&gt; Perfectly named,\n\n51\n00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.300\nvery similar to some of the other files.\n\n52\n00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.920\nBut we do have another worksheet that\nwe're gonna be talking about a little bit,\n\n53\n00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.470\nbut let's stick on quarterly sales.\n\n54\n00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.360\nand I would like to see what my\nJanuary sales figures look like, for\n\n55\n00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.260\nmy four sales representatives here\nat Christmas Cats, Incorporated.\n\n56\n00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.910\nSo just select it.\n\n57\n00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.170\nJust the same way,\nas hey I've got my label there.\n\n58\n00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.750\nI've got my label here.\n\n59\n00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.810\nThis is going to be,\nthe series is January.\n\n60\n00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.120\nFuego, Bishop, Pumpkin, and\nPuma is the category, so\n\n61\n00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.670\nif I've got it all next to each other.\n\n62\n00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.180\nJust select it, come over to Insert.\n\n63\n00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.240\nWe have our pie charts.\n\n64\n00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.668\nAnd we can either do a 2-D,\nwe can also do a 3-D.\n\n65\n00:03:01.668 --> 00:03:04.900\nAnd that's just kind of like\ngiving it a little more pizzaz.\n\n66\n00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.960\nBut we'll just stick here,\nand we will click that.\n\n67\n00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:08.770\nAnd there you go.\n\n68\n00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.420\nSo you can see,\nwho did the most sales on this one?\n\n69\n00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.440\nIt looks like, it's kinda small to see,\nit's Pumpkin, all right?\n\n70\n00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.736\nPumpkin is the one, these colors\nare really close together too.\n\n71\n00:03:17.736 --> 00:03:19.221\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sandbag an old cat.\n\n72\n00:03:19.221 --> 00:03:21.231\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n73\n00:03:21.231 --> 00:03:22.020\nSo, we've got these different ones.\n\n74\n00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.970\nAnd then coming over here to our layouts.\n\n75\n00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.020\nWhich ones do I want to do?\n\n76\n00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.150\nAnd who did what, where?\n\n77\n00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.070\nAll that kind of fun stuff.\n\n78\n00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.190\nSome of them put these data labels.\n\n79\n00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.350\nBut these are some different\nlayouts that you can have.\n\n80\n00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.500\nBut you can always come over into\nyour chart elements, and add, so\n\n81\n00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.070\nlet's say like our data labels.\n\n82\n00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.480\nDo I want them onto the center?\n\n83\n00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.348\nAnd this is kind of a small pie.\n\n84\n00:03:44.348 --> 00:03:45.850\nYou know what we're gonna do?\n\n85\n00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.660\nCuz all the pinks and purples are actually\na little too close together for\n\n86\n00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.150\nme right now, so\nwe're gonna change the theme.\n\n87\n00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.891\nSorry, it was kinda like whoops,\nlet's go ahead and do this really quickly.\n\n88\n00:03:53.891 --> 00:03:56.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it is kind of just throwing me off.\n\n89\n00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.600\nThere, now you can see it a little bit\neasier with the color differentiations,\n\n90\n00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.230\nat least for my eyes.\n\n91\n00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.540\nAnd then, coming back over into the chart\ntools, and I come over to the Design.\n\n92\n00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.040\nThe legend on the bottom's little hard\nto see, so I'm gonna come over here and\n\n93\n00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.290\nput the legend on the right.\n\n94\n00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.065\n&gt;&gt; The John Legend?\n\n95\n00:04:16.065 --> 00:04:17.770\n[LAUGHTER]\n&gt;&gt; Hey, yeah.\n\n96\n00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:18.672\nSo we come over here.\n\n97\n00:04:18.672 --> 00:04:23.770\nAnd then, the other thing is,\nit's a little small for what I can see.\n\n98\n00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.840\nRemember we can select each\nindividual part of our chart.\n\n99\n00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.280\nI can come into here and\n\n100\n00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.090\nformat the background into\nwhatever type of fill that I want.\n\n101\n00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.730\nWe did that in some other episodes.\n\n102\n00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.453\nBut, you can see that if I select this,\nI can make it bigger,\n\n103\n00:04:38.453 --> 00:04:40.675\nbut the text doesn't change size.\n\n104\n00:04:40.675 --> 00:04:44.130\nBut I can come back over here, and\nthen make the font size, that,\n\n105\n00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.840\nsee that's a lot easier to see, isn't it?\n\n106\n00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.858\nNow I can see, pumpkin is grey.\n\n107\n00:04:49.858 --> 00:04:55.140\nWell in real life actually pumpkin is\norange and pooma is grey, but that's okay.\n\n108\n00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.482\n&gt;&gt; For our intents and\npurposes I think they'll get by.\n\n109\n00:04:56.482 --> 00:04:59.149\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Fuego does have blue eyes, so\n\n110\n00:04:59.149 --> 00:05:01.856\nwe're close enough there,\nand Bishop is orange too.\n\n111\n00:05:01.856 --> 00:05:03.979\nOkay sorry, I'm talking about my cats.\n\n112\n00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.670\n[LAUGH] But you can see that the legend\nmakes it a little bit bigger, so I\n\n113\n00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.720\nformatted that specific area in coming\nover and changing the font size, remember?\n\n114\n00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.610\nI mean, it's still just text, so\n\n115\n00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.821\nyou can change all of those\ndifferent formats as you need.\n\n116\n00:05:18.821 --> 00:05:22.748\nAll right, so let's come back over to some\ndifferent things that we can do within\n\n117\n00:05:22.748 --> 00:05:26.740\nthis pie chart, besides just making\nthe legend a little bit bigger.\n\n118\n00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.660\nBut we can see that looks like, yeah,\nFuego's lagging behind over here.\n\n119\n00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.950\nHe doesn't doesn't have very many sales.\n\n120\n00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.412\n&gt;&gt; They're going to let him go if\nhe doesn't bring his numbers up.\n\n121\n00:05:35.412 --> 00:05:37.943\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He has the smallest piece of the pie,\n\n122\n00:05:37.943 --> 00:05:41.739\nand then pumpkin is looking pretty good,\nand also is Bishop,\n\n123\n00:05:41.739 --> 00:05:45.401\nthey were always a bit more\nof the over-achievers anyway.\n\n124\n00:05:45.401 --> 00:05:46.770\nSo we've got all of that.\n\n125\n00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.319\nLet's come back over here to design.\n\n126\n00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.760\nAnd we were going with our data labels.\n\n127\n00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.240\nCuz see, there's only so many elements\nthat we can add into a pie chart, okay.\n\n128\n00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.720\nWe can't add a data table,\n\n129\n00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.020\ncuz there's really not much,\nthere's not values that we need to chart.\n\n130\n00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.665\nThat's kind of weird.\n\n131\n00:06:03.665 --> 00:06:04.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's not values that we\n\n132\n00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:05.090\nneed to chart.\n\n133\n00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.230\nThen what are we making right now?\n\n134\n00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.032\n&gt;&gt; What are we doing here Vonne?\n\n135\n00:06:07.032 --> 00:06:09.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It doesn't work that way,\nbut you do have labels.\n\n136\n00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.010\nRemember we only have one series here.\n\n137\n00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:16.500\nSo it's really the labels of what\nyou would think of as a data table,\n\n138\n00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.220\nin a cluster column chart.\n\n139\n00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.650\nAnd you can go ahead and put them out.\n\n140\n00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.050\nI'm going to put them out\nin the data column but\n\n141\n00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.200\nnotice it's also neat that it's\ndoing all the percentages.\n\n142\n00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.388\nWe didn't have to calculate that.\n\n143\n00:06:27.388 --> 00:06:31.624\nIt does it for us, because it's\nthinking of all these numbers,\n\n144\n00:06:31.624 --> 00:06:34.470\nas part of it all totals up to 100.\n\n145\n00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.990\nAnd so, that's where it's going to change,\nwhat pieces and\n\n146\n00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.210\nwhat percentage of the 100%.\n\n147\n00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.563\nSo you can see here now with\nthe percentages, that okay yeah,\n\n148\n00:06:44.563 --> 00:06:47.422\nPumpkin is at 32 and Bishop is at 29.\n\n149\n00:06:47.422 --> 00:06:50.647\nVisually is,\nto me they look pretty close in size,\n\n150\n00:06:50.647 --> 00:06:54.060\nI'm pretty sure the grey is bigger but\nsometimes.\n\n151\n00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:54.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're close.\n\n152\n00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.814\n&gt;&gt; Yeah with the angle and everything\nit might be a little different but, so\n\n153\n00:06:57.814 --> 00:06:59.050\nyou can go through and do that.\n\n154\n00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.730\nBut if you want some other options,\nif we go into the more data label options.\n\n155\n00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:08.830\nThis brings up the task pane over to the\nright and we've been on this in some other\n\n156\n00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.860\nepisodes, but I do need to get back on\nthe data series, cause I moved it over, so\n\n157\n00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:13.870\nwe could see it a little bit better.\n\n158\n00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.834\nBut I need to come back on to here.\n\n159\n00:07:16.834 --> 00:07:20.922\nAnd it's really not just the data\nseries that I need to change, but\n\n160\n00:07:20.922 --> 00:07:22.900\nI need to come on to the labels.\n\n161\n00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:27.210\nSo if you don't have your labels turned\non, and add it as a chart element,\n\n162\n00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:31.420\nyou might not get the option\nover here in your drop-down,\n\n163\n00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.910\nto be able to get to the label options.\n\n164\n00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:37.157\nSo you need to either select it on\nthe chart, have them on the chart, and\n\n165\n00:07:37.157 --> 00:07:39.884\nthen be able to slash in a chart,\nto come into label option.\n\n166\n00:07:39.884 --> 00:07:43.966\nAnd we wanna do the one that\nlooks like a chart option,\n\n167\n00:07:43.966 --> 00:07:48.430\ncuz I don't need to change the fill or\nthe effect on this.\n\n168\n00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:52.931\nI want to come over here to do,\nwhat do I want to have being shown here?\n\n169\n00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:57.030\nSo you can see if I scroll down through\nsome of these are there's some options\n\n170\n00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:01.208\ndown below my head as well, about where\ndo I want the labels to be positioned?\n\n171\n00:08:01.208 --> 00:08:03.190\nDo I want them on the outside?\n\n172\n00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:04.759\nDo I want them on the inside?\nDo I want them on the center?\n\n173\n00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:08.244\nSo you can see the different\nways that it's going\n\n174\n00:08:08.244 --> 00:08:11.477\nto show you where you\nwant those labels to be.\n\n175\n00:08:11.477 --> 00:08:14.680\nAnd then, what do I need on here?\n\n176\n00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.820\nNow I had a legend over\nhere that was pretty big.\n\n177\n00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:20.830\nBut I could have also done this.\n\n178\n00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:23.470\nI could have just added\nthe category name onto that.\n\n179\n00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:28.280\nOkay so now this is Puma, cuz maybe\nif you had a lot of people there and\n\n180\n00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.750\nalso from far away, and you didn't even\nknow how to make the legend bigger,\n\n181\n00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.830\nwell, I just put the label on there.\n\n182\n00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:35.360\nIt's much easier to go ahead and\n\n183\n00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:40.560\nformat the data label to include\nthe category name right with it.\n\n184\n00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.553\nAnd now you can see it has my value and\nthen I can also add a percentage, so I can\n\n185\n00:08:44.553 --> 00:08:48.550\nadd all of these different things into\nhere as to how I want my labels to look,\n\n186\n00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:51.129\nand what type of information\ndo I want them to be.\n\n187\n00:08:51.129 --> 00:08:55.448\nYou can also have what type of\nseparators do you want them to be on.\n\n188\n00:08:55.448 --> 00:08:57.500\nIf I want them all to\nbe on their own lines,\n\n189\n00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.400\nI think this is a little easier to see.\n\n190\n00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.670\nSo keeping everybody on their own space,\nor you could have them with your commas.\n\n191\n00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:06.680\nI'm gonna go back to new line there.\n\n192\n00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:12.210\nAnd if you needed to, you can have\na number format on each one of these.\n\n193\n00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:15.520\nNow, it is pulling the number\nformat from the cell.\n\n194\n00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.640\nWe already formatted this\nnumber into accounting.\n\n195\n00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.550\nSo there's really no reason for\nme to change it,\n\n196\n00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:24.790\nbut let's just say you needed to\nchange the decimal or what have you.\n\n197\n00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:29.200\nYou can come into here, and see I could\nmake this into dates which wouldn't\n\n198\n00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:29.820\nmake-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n199\n00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:30.988\n&gt;&gt; Any sense at all but\n\n200\n00:09:30.988 --> 00:09:34.129\n[LAUGH] I could correlate\nthat into it if I needed to.\n\n201\n00:09:34.129 --> 00:09:37.630\nSo, if it's not pulling the right\nnumber format from your cells,\n\n202\n00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.066\nyou can format it here\nin your data labels, and\n\n203\n00:09:40.066 --> 00:09:43.670\nthen you can use all the different\ntypes of things that you need.\n\n204\n00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:48.400\nSo, some really neat things that you can\ndo with the labels on your pie chart and\n\n205\n00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.780\ngetting into those options.\n\n206\n00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:51.890\nAnd really just knowing that\nthey're even available.\n\n207\n00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:55.460\nThat's why a lot of people are like I\nwanna be able to put the percentages and\n\n208\n00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:56.170\nthe values.\n\n209\n00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:59.362\nI'm like you just need to go\ninto the data label options and\n\n210\n00:09:59.362 --> 00:10:00.819\nthen put the checkboxes in.\n\n211\n00:10:00.819 --> 00:10:01.479\n&gt;&gt; That's fun to say.\n\n212\n00:10:01.479 --> 00:10:02.249\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I know, right?\n\n213\n00:10:02.249 --> 00:10:03.078\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n214\n00:10:03.078 --> 00:10:03.893\n&gt;&gt; I kinda tripped over that a couple\n\n215\n00:10:03.893 --> 00:10:04.764\ntimes.\n&gt;&gt; Data label options.\n\n216\n00:10:04.764 --> 00:10:06.516\nIt's like a definite tongue twister.\n\n217\n00:10:06.516 --> 00:10:07.410\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n218\n00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:08.580\nI'm gonna try not to say it again.\n\n219\n00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:09.710\nThat thing over there on the right.\n\n220\n00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:10.415\nClick the buttons.\n\n221\n00:10:10.415 --> 00:10:12.287\n[LAUGH] So\nthat's how we're gonna describe it.\n\n222\n00:10:13.474 --> 00:10:16.620\nSo some different things\nthat you can do here.\n\n223\n00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.730\nIf you needed to,\nyou could change the type of chart,\n\n224\n00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:25.710\nbecause within this pie group,\nwe have the regular flat pie,\n\n225\n00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:29.270\nyou could also put it into a 3D,\nif you wanted to.\n\n226\n00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:32.315\nKind of angle it, with the data\nlabels on there, it's not as 3D.\n\n227\n00:10:32.315 --> 00:10:35.881\nIf I had left all the labels off,\nit might make it a little bit different.\n\n228\n00:10:35.881 --> 00:10:39.400\nBut you can also go into a donut chart.\n\n229\n00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.511\nTalk about pies and donuts right?\n\n230\n00:10:40.511 --> 00:10:43.049\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Our foodiest show yet.\n\n231\n00:10:43.049 --> 00:10:44.572\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n232\n00:10:44.572 --> 00:10:48.318\nyou can see we have the donut, because\nthat is again all part of a whole and\n\n233\n00:10:48.318 --> 00:10:50.852\nwhat piece of a donut do\nyou want instead of a pie.\n\n234\n00:10:50.852 --> 00:10:52.828\n&gt;&gt; I want that blue donut.\n\n235\n00:10:52.828 --> 00:10:55.436\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And then of course once you\n\n236\n00:10:55.436 --> 00:11:00.484\nstart adding on the different data labels,\nthat's pretty that's nice.\n\n237\n00:11:00.484 --> 00:11:02.275\n&gt;&gt; That's snazzy, that's snazzy.\n\n238\n00:11:02.275 --> 00:11:05.331\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm more taken with the look\n\n239\n00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:08.280\nof the thing than what's\nit's actually doing.\n\n240\n00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:08.800\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n241\n00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.672\nnow it's starting to make me feel like\na cruise ship right now for some reason.\n\n242\n00:11:11.672 --> 00:11:12.803\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I wonder why.\n\n243\n00:11:12.803 --> 00:11:14.664\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if it's the colors or\nsomething's going on.\n\n244\n00:11:14.664 --> 00:11:17.290\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to the majestic of the seas,\nright?\n\n245\n00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:18.741\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, you know very well.\n\n246\n00:11:18.741 --> 00:11:23.323\nSo, you can say that you're changing\nthe different types of pies and\n\n247\n00:11:23.323 --> 00:11:26.000\nthe different types of styles.\n\n248\n00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.054\nWith the data labels and the things that\nyou've kinda created with your chart it\n\n249\n00:11:30.054 --> 00:11:34.427\ndoes makes some differences, and there's\nsome really, some snazzy styles there.\n\n250\n00:11:34.427 --> 00:11:35.068\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no doubt.\n\n251\n00:11:35.068 --> 00:11:35.786\n&gt;&gt; Good stuff.\n\n252\n00:11:35.786 --> 00:11:39.640\nAll right, so now let's go ahead and\ndo another example.\n\n253\n00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:43.211\nAnd we will just click this off over here.\n\n254\n00:11:43.211 --> 00:11:48.426\nLet's move this, let's just move this\nover into a new sheet by itself,\n\n255\n00:11:48.426 --> 00:11:50.840\njust so we can still have it.\n\n256\n00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.260\nBut just off to the side.\n\n257\n00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.424\nComing over to weekly, nope,\nquarterly sales [LAUGH]\n\n258\n00:11:54.424 --> 00:11:54.936\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n259\n00:11:54.936 --> 00:11:56.504\n&gt;&gt; So let's say I wanted to go ahead and\n\n260\n00:11:56.504 --> 00:11:57.620\nmake one for February.\n\n261\n00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:01.510\nNow we've talked about selecting our\nlabels from non-contiguous spaces.\n\n262\n00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:05.160\nSo if I wanted to say, hey,\nlet's go ahead and get February.\n\n263\n00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.431\nBut I also need my labels, so let's go\nahead and select Fuego, Bishop, and Puma.\n\n264\n00:12:08.431 --> 00:12:09.707\nI'm using my ctrl key.\n\n265\n00:12:09.707 --> 00:12:14.290\nAnd then I try to insert the chart.\n\n266\n00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:15.396\nIt's not gonna correlate.\n\n267\n00:12:15.396 --> 00:12:18.466\nIt's gonna say, I don't really\nknow what you're doing there.\n\n268\n00:12:18.466 --> 00:12:22.730\n[LAUGH] But if I look at the numbers,\nthey're all close to each other.\n\n269\n00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:23.860\nSo it's pulling the right ones in.\n\n270\n00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:29.925\nIt just wasn't able to get those labels\nby me selecting non-contiguous cells.\n\n271\n00:12:29.925 --> 00:12:31.900\nBut that's okay.\n\n272\n00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:35.670\nWe've talked about being\nable to get data labels or\n\n273\n00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:40.690\nnot data labels I'm sorry, category\nlabel access, category access labels.\n\n274\n00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:41.759\nWaw, I will say it right\none of these times.\n\n275\n00:12:41.759 --> 00:12:45.930\n[LAUGH] By going into\nthe select data button.\n\n276\n00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:51.320\nAnd so now you can see that\nit is adding Fuago and\n\n277\n00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:55.190\nFebruary and it's like,\nno this is not right.\n\n278\n00:12:55.190 --> 00:13:00.530\nSo sometimes if you\njust grab the raw data,\n\n279\n00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:06.290\nand then add the legend, or\nthe series title and the horizontal\n\n280\n00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:11.250\naxis titles in their separately from\nthis dialog box it can make a little\n\n281\n00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:15.200\nbit more sense, cuz right now it's just\nnot really working, but that's all right.\n\n282\n00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:19.360\nWe can take this February here,\ncuz it's trying to pull that in.\n\n283\n00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.490\nThat is the right one, but\nI don't want the Fuego.\n\n284\n00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:23.096\nFuego is not a series.\n\n285\n00:13:23.096 --> 00:13:25.780\nWe can't have multiple series.\n\n286\n00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:26.798\nSo I could take this and just remove it.\n\n287\n00:13:26.798 --> 00:13:30.380\nNo, February-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n288\n00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:31.880\n&gt;&gt; Is my series.\n\n289\n00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.920\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure Fuego would love\nit to be called Fueguary.\n\n290\n00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:35.716\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n291\n00:13:35.716 --> 00:13:37.126\n&gt;&gt; We call him all sorts of\n\n292\n00:13:37.126 --> 00:13:38.190\nnames.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n293\n00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:39.210\n&gt;&gt; That's not\n\n294\n00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:40.470\none of them though.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n295\n00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:42.730\n&gt;&gt; It does start with the letter f.\n\n296\n00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:43.505\n&gt;&gt; We can get a little\n\n297\n00:13:43.505 --> 00:13:44.390\ncolorful with him.\n\n298\n00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:45.147\n&gt;&gt; Free.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n299\n00:13:45.147 --> 00:13:45.798\n&gt;&gt; Friendly.\n\n300\n00:13:45.798 --> 00:13:47.221\n&gt;&gt; Friendly, furry guy.\n\n301\n00:13:47.221 --> 00:13:48.627\n&gt;&gt; Stinking cat.\n\n302\n00:13:48.627 --> 00:13:49.791\n[LAUGH]\n\n303\n00:13:49.791 --> 00:13:50.315\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n304\n00:13:50.315 --> 00:13:54.194\n[LAUGH] But Fuego is part of our category,\n\n305\n00:13:54.194 --> 00:13:58.983\nso we need to come over here and\nget to the labels for\n\n306\n00:13:58.983 --> 00:14:02.480\nthat category axis.\nSo if we click that Edit and\n\n307\n00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.830\nthen select these,\nbecause that's where it's going down.\n\n308\n00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:06.780\nAnd we say, OK.\n\n309\n00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:09.650\nYep, there we go, and\nnow we've got everything right.\n\n310\n00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:13.140\nSo, again, selecting just the numbers,\ntaking and\n\n311\n00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:18.580\nget the labels for\nthe series and or the category.\n\n312\n00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:19.726\nGo ahead and do it from this dialogue box.\n\n313\n00:14:19.726 --> 00:14:23.829\nThey're not always as beautiful as our\nfirst example of everything was right next\n\n314\n00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:25.006\nto each other.\n\n315\n00:14:25.006 --> 00:14:27.110\nThere we go.\nSo now we've got that.\n\n316\n00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:31.970\nWe could do the data labels again and\nmaybe we'll\n\n317\n00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:36.480\ntake off the legend because you can see\nits going Puma, Pumpkin, Bishop and Fuego.\n\n318\n00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.860\nSo it's almost like we don't\neven need the legend there.\n\n319\n00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:43.580\nSo, quick and\nthen throw on a fancy little style.\n\n320\n00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:49.560\nSo now we get over into pie within a pie,\nthis is the fun one because.-\n\n321\n00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.039\n&gt;&gt; The coup de grace [LAUGH]\n\n322\n00:14:51.039 --> 00:14:53.165\n&gt;&gt; Yes, because this is our one series and\n\n323\n00:14:53.165 --> 00:14:54.031\nthat's fine.\n\n324\n00:14:54.031 --> 00:14:58.820\nWhen you have a pie within a pie,\nI think it's the easiest way is to\n\n325\n00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:03.070\nshow by coming over to our example of,\nwe have our sales representatives.\n\n326\n00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:06.901\nAnd we have their new customer numbers.\n\n327\n00:15:06.901 --> 00:15:09.050\nNow there's quite a lot of people in here,\nright?\n\n328\n00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:10.870\nWe've got about,\nI think there's 10 in here.\n\n329\n00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:12.174\nYes, we have 10 sales reps.\n\n330\n00:15:12.174 --> 00:15:17.620\nAnd some of them, we had some that did\nreally well, some that didn't do well.\n\n331\n00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:21.320\nLet's first sort this just to make\nit a little easier for our brains.\n\n332\n00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.130\nWe're gonna go from largest to smallest.\n\n333\n00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:26.530\nOkay, so now you can see that Belle,\nBelle Darling went ahead and\n\n334\n00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:28.480\ngot 29 new customers.\n\n335\n00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:33.279\nBut then, Cheeto Sticks, Cheeto kind\nof lagging behind, he only got 3.\n\n336\n00:15:33.279 --> 00:15:38.479\nBut, there's quite a few of them that\nif you looked at the first four,\n\n337\n00:15:38.479 --> 00:15:41.660\nthey got the bulk of the new customers.\n\n338\n00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:45.460\nBut then the other six,\nthere's a big jump between 22 and 12.\n\n339\n00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:48.646\nSo if you think about as a total,\n\n340\n00:15:48.646 --> 00:15:53.602\nwe could have our main\npeople had this amount, but\n\n341\n00:15:53.602 --> 00:15:59.507\nthen the others of this percent,\nthis is their breakdown.\n\n342\n00:15:59.507 --> 00:16:02.496\nI think it's easiest if\nwe just demonstrate it.\n\n343\n00:16:02.496 --> 00:16:06.763\nSo we're going to take this\ninformation right here and\n\n344\n00:16:06.763 --> 00:16:13.370\nwe're going to then insert a pie chart,\nbut we're going to do a pie within a pie.\n\n345\n00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:16.480\nSo you can see showing\nportions of a whole and\n\n346\n00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:21.540\nthen taking one of those portions and\nthen breaking it down even further.\n\n347\n00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:25.290\nSo if I click this one, it's still\nprobably not gonna make much sense with\n\n348\n00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:29.250\nthe way it's designed right now, and I'm\ngonna make this just a little longer and\n\n349\n00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:32.580\na little bit bigger so we can see that.\n\n350\n00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:38.030\nOkay, remember, we said that\nthe first four were our top sales and\n\n351\n00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:42.050\nthen anybody that was pretty much,\nlike, below, let's say 15,\n\n352\n00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:45.450\nthey make up the percentage\nof like the smaller guys.\n\n353\n00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:48.650\nSo what you need to do is you\nneed to format the data series.\n\n354\n00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:52.210\nAnd how you can do that, you can click\non one of the pieces, and you can\n\n355\n00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:56.300\nright click, and you can format data\nseries, and it brings over our task pane.\n\n356\n00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:59.640\nAnd then over here on\nthe right-hand side where it says,\n\n357\n00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.930\nsplit series by,\nwe're not gonna do position here.\n\n358\n00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:07.060\nWe're gonna drop this down and\ngo to Value.\n\n359\n00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:08.650\nSo here's our value and then it's like,\n\n360\n00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:13.830\nthis is still looking kinda weird,\nbut these are our smaller guys, right?\n\n361\n00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:16.180\nWe wanna say that the value\nthat is less than 15.\n\n362\n00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:19.280\nSo anybody who did not do 15 or\nabove, this is,\n\n363\n00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:23.960\nokay now it's starting to\nmake a little more sense.\n\n364\n00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:27.820\nThis is our top three or\nfour performers and\n\n365\n00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:33.740\nthen the other ones that are making\nup these particular pieces below 15,\n\n366\n00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:37.940\nthen they're going to go ahead and\nmake this many.\n\n367\n00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:39.780\nAnd then that's where you\ncan change it from here.\n\n368\n00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:43.390\nAgain, keep it ongoing,\nif we throw on some labels.\n\n369\n00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:46.170\nLets go with our call out.\n\n370\n00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:48.540\nThere.\nNow, I think you can see this a little bit\n\n371\n00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:49.280\nmore.\n\n372\n00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.280\nSo if I zoom in here.\n\n373\n00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:56.740\nSee that Brandy and Elvis and Belle and\nBlossom, they did pretty good.\n\n374\n00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:01.510\nThe others were 33%, but then all of\nthese is a breakdown of that 33%.\n\n375\n00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:06.368\n&gt;&gt; So that's what makes up the 33% and\nthen showing us the percentages\n\n376\n00:18:06.368 --> 00:18:09.224\n&gt;&gt; of that 33% what is making all of\n\n377\n00:18:09.224 --> 00:18:10.180\nthe\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n378\n00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:12.060\n&gt;&gt; It's crazy the talk, but\nyou get where I'm going.\n\n379\n00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, totally,\nthat's exactly what it does.\n\n380\n00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:15.480\nSo, it kind of breaks down.\n\n381\n00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.810\nAnd then this is where you can\nbreak it down like the main,\n\n382\n00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:19.530\nit has to be anything below 10.\n\n383\n00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.650\nWell then that's a little bit\ndifferent because who's below 10?\n\n384\n00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:25.930\nFuego, Bishop and Chito.\n\n385\n00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:28.130\nOkay?\nAnd they made up, combined,\n\n386\n00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:32.580\nthey made up of 11%\n&gt;&gt; of the whole.\n\n387\n00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:38.740\nAnd of that 11%, then Bishop,\nFuego got most of that part of the pie.\n\n388\n00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:42.480\nSo that's how you have to think\nabout if you change it by value, and\n\n389\n00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.590\nif I did let's say below 12.\n\n390\n00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:45.760\nOkay, there we go.\n\n391\n00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.730\nSo 12 that was Puma Princess\ngoes in there.\n\n392\n00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:50.970\nAnd now we have our different pieces here.\n\n393\n00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:54.630\nAnd so that's kind of like\na neat little pie within a pie.\n\n394\n00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:57.610\nIt's a breakdown of this particular piece.\n\n395\n00:18:57.610 --> 00:18:58.370\n&gt;&gt; I like this.\n\n396\n00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:59.920\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nIt's neat, right?\n\n397\n00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:03.010\nIf you think about it,\nwell that second plot part and\n\n398\n00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:08.560\nthat's actually behind my head just to\nshow you, but this second pie over here,\n\n399\n00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:12.090\nI can make it bigger or smaller, right?\n\n400\n00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:16.970\nSo maybe for visual purposes,\nlet's make it a little bit smaller.\n\n401\n00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:18.900\n&gt;&gt; So you can see that this other is here.\n\n402\n00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.470\nAnd I can move cuz these\nare overlapping a little bit.\n\n403\n00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:27.500\nYou can't really separate the pieces,\nwell, the two pies further away.\n\n404\n00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:28.260\nBut you can take this.\n\n405\n00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.570\nAnd I can move this other down.\n\n406\n00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:34.120\nOr I can move Alice Wonderpaws\nover a little bit so\n\n407\n00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:38.120\nit's not fully overlapping each other and\nbecause it has those, kind of,\n\n408\n00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:41.030\nlittle call outs the way that they do,\nyou can see that.\n\n409\n00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:43.280\nAnd, I'm gonna actually\ntake off the legend.\n\n410\n00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:47.460\nJust so, we don't need that because we\nhave all the categories, right here.\n\n411\n00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:50.680\nAnd then you can, of course, come back\nin just like we did in the other charts.\n\n412\n00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:55.190\nYou can come in and change the label\noptions of, do I want the category name,\n\n413\n00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:57.370\ndo I want the percentages,\ndo I want the value, so\n\n414\n00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:01.620\nthat way I can see how many new customers\n&gt;&gt; they are acquiring,\n\n415\n00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.970\nand then the percentages from there,\n\n416\n00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:08.970\nand I can make them all on new lines,\nand so on and so forth.\n\n417\n00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:10.770\nThat might make it a little bit easier.\n\n418\n00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:17.790\nSo that is our pie within a pie, and\nI think it's a pretty cool little feature.\n\n419\n00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:18.900\nAnd you see these.\n\n420\n00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:22.070\nYou know, you see this all the time\nbecause you don't really want to show\n\n421\n00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:26.500\nevery single little piece in there\nbecause it's just, but of those others,\n\n422\n00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:28.430\nthis is what the breakdown is.\n\n423\n00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:32.800\nAnd so that is a pie within a pie,\nand now I think it's time for\n\n424\n00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:33.850\nus to get some pie\n&gt;&gt; I\n\n425\n00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:34.700\nlike it\n&gt;&gt; Yes!-\n\n426\n00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:35.462\n&gt;&gt; We have some pizza pie-\n\n427\n00:20:35.462 --> 00:20:36.090\n&gt;&gt; We do!-\n\n428\n00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:36.836\n&gt;&gt; Actually waiting\n\n429\n00:20:36.836 --> 00:20:37.336\nfor us-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Yeah-\n\n430\n00:20:37.336 --> 00:20:37.836\n&gt;&gt; Ha Ha!-\n\n431\n00:20:37.836 --> 00:20:39.035\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Yeah we have that for lunch\n\n432\n00:20:39.035 --> 00:20:40.950\n&gt;&gt; We can fulfill that satiation.\n\n433\n00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:42.190\nI love it.\n\n434\n00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:43.120\n&gt;&gt; Very cool stuff man.\n\n435\n00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.790\nThis pies are very neat.\n\n436\n00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:48.540\nYou're probably gonna wanna use them from\ntime to time as you create reports or\n\n437\n00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:51.350\njust work with data in general\nto give that more visual format.\n\n438\n00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:54.760\nAnd maybe this is the right thing for\nthat very thing.\n\n439\n00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.900\nJust to give you a good visual understand\nwhat it is the heck you're looking at.\n\n440\n00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.890\nBecause sometimes it's just\nnumbers on a screen and\n\n441\n00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:03.002\nyou're like, I just can't look at that.\n\n442\n00:21:03.002 --> 00:21:07.760\nPut a little color, put a little label,\nyou put a little bit of a graphic to\n\n443\n00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:11.675\nit and all of a sudden, it comes alive and\nit makes it a whole lot easier to digest.\n\n444\n00:21:11.675 --> 00:21:15.040\nVonne, thanks, I think you did a great\njob showing us how we can work with pies\n\n445\n00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.900\ninside of Excel but guess what?\n\n446\n00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.150\nI'm looking at the pie on our clock there\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n447\n00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:20.740\n&gt;&gt; and it has moved into the we are out of\n\n448\n00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:21.820\ntime vicinity.\n\n449\n00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:24.815\nSo I think we have less than\n1% left of time, [LAUGH]\n\n450\n00:21:24.815 --> 00:21:25.634\n&gt;&gt; Look at you.\n\n451\n00:21:25.634 --> 00:21:27.571\n&gt;&gt; We can make a chart about that.\n\n452\n00:21:27.571 --> 00:21:29.181\n&gt;&gt; I love it, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Great stuff.\n\n453\n00:21:29.181 --> 00:21:30.950\n&gt;&gt; All right everyone,\nthanks for joining us.\n\n454\n00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:34.117\nSigning off for Office Pro TV I\nhave been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n455\n00:21:34.117 --> 00:21:36.438\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n456\n00:21:36.438 --> 00:21:40.586\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they have lines.\n\n38\n00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:32.177\n[LAUGH] Well, let's start with sparklines.\n\n39\n00:01:32.177 --> 00:01:34.322\nI love sparklines, they're really cute.\n\n40\n00:01:34.322 --> 00:01:36.290\nI mean, seriously, they're cute.\n\n41\n00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.170\n&gt;&gt; Well, let me start here.\n\n42\n00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.271\nWhat's a sparkline?\n\n43\n00:01:39.271 --> 00:01:42.584\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's a baby chart.\n\n44\n00:01:42.584 --> 00:01:48.106\n&gt;&gt; Literally, it's a baby chart\nthat goes in the cell to show-\n\n45\n00:01:48.106 --> 00:01:49.335\n&gt;&gt; Wow, it's in the cell.\n\n46\n00:01:49.335 --> 00:01:50.520\n&gt;&gt; It's in the cell.\n&gt;&gt; That's cool.\n\n47\n00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.847\nI'm already like ιf it's what I think it\nis in my brain, that's gonna be awesome.\n\n48\n00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:54.680\n&gt;&gt; It's really adorable.\n\n49\n00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.529\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n50\n00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:57.319\nthe easiest way is to show you.\n\n51\n00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:02.503\nSo let's jump on down into\nthe sparklines and timelines.\n\n52\n00:02:02.503 --> 00:02:04.692\nI probably should have put an S on that.\n\n53\n00:02:04.692 --> 00:02:06.530\nAnyways, this is the file\nI'm working with, all right?\n\n54\n00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.400\nSo we've got this and\nI've got a couple of sheets in here.\n\n55\n00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.282\nAnd this is sparklines one\njust to give you an idea.\n\n56\n00:02:11.282 --> 00:02:14.111\nSo here's our first and\nlast January, February, March, okay.\n\n57\n00:02:14.111 --> 00:02:18.300\nSo I could go ahead and\nmake a whole chart chart out of this.\n\n58\n00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.957\nBut wouldn't it be cute,\nliterally cute, to go ahead and\n\n59\n00:02:21.957 --> 00:02:26.524\njust put a tiny chart right on there,\njust show me the idea going on here.\n\n60\n00:02:26.524 --> 00:02:28.085\nSo now you can either do it in two ways.\n\n61\n00:02:28.085 --> 00:02:31.777\nYou can go ahead and click in\nthe cell that you wanna go ahead and\n\n62\n00:02:31.777 --> 00:02:33.493\ninsert the sparkline into.\n\n63\n00:02:33.493 --> 00:02:38.542\nOr you can select the data that\nyou want the sparkline to chart.\n\n64\n00:02:38.542 --> 00:02:39.813\nSo let's go this way.\n\n65\n00:02:39.813 --> 00:02:42.630\nWe'll click on this,\nwhere we wanna put it.\n\n66\n00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.231\nWe're gonna go to the Insert.\n\n67\n00:02:44.231 --> 00:02:47.013\nAnd then we're gonna go\nover here to Sparklines.\n\n68\n00:02:47.013 --> 00:02:49.329\nAnd see that's where you see\nsparklines and timeline.\n\n69\n00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.950\nThey're very close to each\nother on the Insert tab.\n\n70\n00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.831\nSo we're just gonna go with Column.\n\n71\n00:02:53.831 --> 00:02:58.840\nAnd now, once I get here, it's like I've\ngot the location already established.\n\n72\n00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.598\nTell me what data is that\nI need to know to chart.\n\n73\n00:03:02.598 --> 00:03:07.580\nSo I come out here, cursor is in the\nfield, come out with my white plus sign.\n\n74\n00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.401\nCome over here.\n\n75\n00:03:08.401 --> 00:03:09.542\nSelect that.\n\n76\n00:03:09.542 --> 00:03:10.453\nThat's what I want.\n\n77\n00:03:10.453 --> 00:03:11.290\nYou click OK.\n\n78\n00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.456\nAnd there it is.\n\n79\n00:03:14.456 --> 00:03:16.502\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what I thought\nit was gonna be in my brain.\n\n80\n00:03:16.502 --> 00:03:18.201\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's super cute.\n\n81\n00:03:18.201 --> 00:03:18.775\n&gt;&gt; It is really cool.\n\n82\n00:03:18.775 --> 00:03:19.383\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n83\n00:03:19.383 --> 00:03:20.961\n&gt;&gt; And the, even-\n&gt;&gt; I can't say cute.\n\n84\n00:03:20.961 --> 00:03:21.513\nThat's just-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n85\n00:03:21.513 --> 00:03:22.712\n&gt;&gt; I'll give my man card up, okay.\n\n86\n00:03:22.712 --> 00:03:24.172\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'll go ahead and\nuse it for you.\n\n87\n00:03:24.172 --> 00:03:25.641\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there you go.\n\n88\n00:03:25.641 --> 00:03:30.629\n&gt;&gt; So even more adorable than this is,\njust remember how we did the fill series,\n\n89\n00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:31.180\nright?\n\n90\n00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.446\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Where you took the fill handle,\n\n91\n00:03:32.446 --> 00:03:35.240\nthe black plus sign on the bottom\nright-hand corner, you copy down, and\n\n92\n00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.505\nthen it would go ahead and do the change\nof everything, January, February, March.\n\n93\n00:03:38.505 --> 00:03:39.409\nSame thing here.\n\n94\n00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:41.832\nThis is really more in\nline with functions and\n\n95\n00:03:41.832 --> 00:03:46.550\nformulas to where it uses that relative\nreference to you move down, it moves down.\n\n96\n00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.349\nSo I just take this and just bloop.\n\n97\n00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:50.750\nJust take it on down and there you go.\n\n98\n00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:51.641\n&gt;&gt; That's so cool.\n\n99\n00:03:51.641 --> 00:03:53.197\n&gt;&gt; Right, isn't that cute?\n\n100\n00:03:53.197 --> 00:03:55.161\n&gt;&gt; Kind of looks like\nKnight Rider's read out menu.\n\n101\n00:03:55.161 --> 00:03:57.099\n&gt;&gt; My God, [INAUDIBLE].\n\n102\n00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.482\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH] I loved that show.\n\n103\n00:04:00.482 --> 00:04:02.005\nThat was the best show growing up.\n\n104\n00:04:02.005 --> 00:04:04.247\nSo all right, so anyways, back to.\n\n105\n00:04:04.247 --> 00:04:05.135\nWe always digress on these things.\n\n106\n00:04:05.135 --> 00:04:06.114\n&gt;&gt; No more 80s references, right?\n\n107\n00:04:06.114 --> 00:04:09.014\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\nyou can see that when I click on it,\n\n108\n00:04:09.014 --> 00:04:12.642\nit actually brings up\na contextual tab on the ribbon,\n\n109\n00:04:12.642 --> 00:04:16.860\nthat it recognizes that any of these,\nit's all sparklines.\n\n110\n00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.875\nIt sees that this is what we've done.\n\n111\n00:04:18.875 --> 00:04:22.655\nAnd it's very much like format is table\nwhere you go ahead and get the little\n\n112\n00:04:22.655 --> 00:04:27.140\ncheck boxes, the options that you could\ngo ahead and format things differently.\n\n113\n00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:33.040\nSo if I wanted to highlight the high\npoint, notice with that it goes ahead and\n\n114\n00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.770\nmakes like what's the highest\nvalue in each one of these.\n\n115\n00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.514\nIt goes ahead and\nmakes it a different color.\n\n116\n00:04:37.514 --> 00:04:39.074\nI can also do a low point.\n\n117\n00:04:39.074 --> 00:04:42.030\nNow these are really low, so\nyou're probably not gonna see it as much.\n\n118\n00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.990\nBut you can also see negative points.\n\n119\n00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.852\nAnd if you have first and last,\nif it's the first column, or\n\n120\n00:04:46.852 --> 00:04:50.107\nthe last column in here, means\nsomething to you, you can go ahead and\n\n121\n00:04:50.107 --> 00:04:52.207\nhighlight them, and that's how you do it.\n\n122\n00:04:52.207 --> 00:04:55.369\nNow with these little baby charts,\nthe other thing that might make it\n\n123\n00:04:55.369 --> 00:04:58.850\na little easier is well,\nwhy don't we change the row height?\n\n124\n00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.334\nSo I'm gonna come over here to the row and\nI'm selecting now row 2.\n\n125\n00:05:03.334 --> 00:05:08.305\nClick, hold, and drag down, so\nI'm selecting the whole range of rows.\n\n126\n00:05:08.305 --> 00:05:10.263\nCome in between any one of them.\n\n127\n00:05:10.263 --> 00:05:13.346\nAnd I'm just gonna come in between 2 and\n3, get the two pointed arrows,\n\n128\n00:05:13.346 --> 00:05:15.757\npull that down a little bit,\nand that brings all of them.\n\n129\n00:05:15.757 --> 00:05:20.644\nSo now with the rows just a little higher,\nI can see a little bit more of the,\n\n130\n00:05:20.644 --> 00:05:24.850\nwe'll call it the dynamic range or\nwhatever of this sparkline.\n\n131\n00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.080\nAnd so I can see the lower ones and\nthe higher ones a little bit better.\n\n132\n00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.710\nAnd so now you can see that.\n\n133\n00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.793\nWhat if I want the higher\npoint to be a different color?\n\n134\n00:05:32.793 --> 00:05:35.840\nIt's choosing red, but\nI want it to be different.\n\n135\n00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.748\nClick anywhere in that sparkline,\ncome over here to Design, and\n\n136\n00:05:40.748 --> 00:05:44.863\nthen right over here,\nyou have your sparkline color.\n\n137\n00:05:44.863 --> 00:05:45.990\nThat's not the one I wanted to do.\n\n138\n00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.852\nI'm sorry it's the marker color,\nthe one right below it is, there we go.\n\n139\n00:05:49.852 --> 00:05:52.105\nWhat color do I want the high point to be?\n\n140\n00:05:52.105 --> 00:05:55.020\nMaybe I want it to be bright green.\n\n141\n00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.000\nAnd then of course, use it.\n\n142\n00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.500\nThis is all background to your themes and\nyou can go back and change your themes.\n\n143\n00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.890\nAnd I can make my low point to be red or\nso on and so forth.\n\n144\n00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.774\nSo I can make different colors mean\nsomething here within my sparklines,\n\n145\n00:06:08.774 --> 00:06:10.044\nall right, cool.\n\n146\n00:06:10.044 --> 00:06:13.440\nAnd I mean, that's as easy as it gets.\n\n147\n00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.810\nA few other things that we could do,\nnotice over here in the type,\n\n148\n00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.078\nwhat if I wanted it to be\nmore of a line chart here?\n\n149\n00:06:21.078 --> 00:06:26.399\nSo I could see where, and I do have, if I\nclick off it, I'm still using my colors,\n\n150\n00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:31.050\nright, for the high and lows,\nbecause that's still an option.\n\n151\n00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:36.653\nSo this could show it more as like trends,\nrather than columns.\n\n152\n00:06:36.653 --> 00:06:39.335\nSo you could see those types of things.\n\n153\n00:06:39.335 --> 00:06:42.450\nAnd then you could go and\nmake negative points in there.\n\n154\n00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:45.590\nOn the line one,\nnotice that there is markers.\n\n155\n00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.430\nIf I click Markers, that's actually\ngonna give me all of the dots.\n\n156\n00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:55.207\nSo it kind of shows you where the points\nare within this particular line chart.\n\n157\n00:06:55.207 --> 00:06:58.170\nBut it's a baby chart, it's a sparkline.\n\n158\n00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:02.934\nSo it goes in the cell,\nthat's the data that lives in that cell,\n\n159\n00:07:02.934 --> 00:07:04.624\nwhich is pretty cute.\n\n160\n00:07:04.624 --> 00:07:06.543\nSo I love them.\n\n161\n00:07:06.543 --> 00:07:10.212\nAnd just as another representation,\nremember I started here and\n\n162\n00:07:10.212 --> 00:07:13.829\nwhere I wanted the sparkline to go and\nthen I told where to chart.\n\n163\n00:07:13.829 --> 00:07:15.680\nLet's just do it for fun,\nlet's go the other way.\n\n164\n00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.930\nLet's select the data that I want first.\n\n165\n00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:22.228\nGo ahead and insert,\nwe will do a line for fun,\n\n166\n00:07:22.228 --> 00:07:26.132\nand notice now my cursor's\njust in a different place.\n\n167\n00:07:26.132 --> 00:07:29.451\nWhere is the location of where\nyou want that sparkline to go?\n\n168\n00:07:29.451 --> 00:07:32.826\nSo with that cursor in that field,\nI just select that cell and\n\n169\n00:07:32.826 --> 00:07:34.160\nit does the same thing.\n\n170\n00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.080\nSo this one would probably\nlook better as columns.\n\n171\n00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.280\nDrag that down and so on and so forth.\n\n172\n00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.490\nAnd I've watched some different things.\n\n173\n00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.303\nWe always talk about I watch\nthe tutorials, just a thing.\n\n174\n00:07:46.303 --> 00:07:47.661\nI don't know if anyone else does.\n\n175\n00:07:47.661 --> 00:07:51.147\nAnd I saw, they did it,\ntalking about that whole dashboard thing\n\n176\n00:07:51.147 --> 00:07:53.997\nthat we've been talking out\nthrough this whole series.\n\n177\n00:07:53.997 --> 00:07:58.967\nAnd the other episode we just filmed\nactually, was the pivot charts.\n\n178\n00:07:58.967 --> 00:08:01.936\nSo they took this and\nput it on another sheet,\n\n179\n00:08:01.936 --> 00:08:05.600\ncuz it doesn't have to be\nright next to the data.\n\n180\n00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:10.760\nIf I came over here, made my own\nworksheet, selected a specific cell, and\n\n181\n00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.530\nthen said,\nthis is where I want to insert my slicer.\n\n182\n00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:18.205\nI just say, all right,\nnot a slicer, spark line [LAUGH].\n\n183\n00:08:18.205 --> 00:08:20.767\nIt's one of those, you know when you\nare talking and you see something, and\n\n184\n00:08:20.767 --> 00:08:23.027\nyou just like say the word that's\nright in front, I just did that.\n\n185\n00:08:23.027 --> 00:08:25.365\n&gt;&gt; Don't say elephant,\nthe first thing you say is elephant.\n\n186\n00:08:25.365 --> 00:08:27.633\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, [LAUGH] so\nI saw a slicer and\n\n187\n00:08:27.633 --> 00:08:30.290\njust interjected it into\nthe speech I was saying.\n\n188\n00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:34.010\nWhen I really wanted to enter a spark\nline., so I come over here, so\n\n189\n00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:37.190\nI'm on this worksheet,\nnow I just go and find the data range.\n\n190\n00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:41.690\nI would say, okay, so let's come over\nhere and select these cells, and\n\n191\n00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:45.760\nnotice that's just saying that on\nthis worksheet, this range of cells.\n\n192\n00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.853\nClick OK, and then they just\nmade their rows pretty high, and\n\n193\n00:08:49.853 --> 00:08:51.829\ntheir column a little wider.\n\n194\n00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:55.820\nAnd they have things like,\nI think they have Monday on this side and\n\n195\n00:08:55.820 --> 00:09:00.660\nthen Friday on this side, to show this\nis the beginning and ending of the week.\n\n196\n00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.740\nAnd then they just took this and then,\ncan you just drag it down there?\n\n197\n00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:09.525\nYeah, perfect, so however far it\nwas on that other sheet, and so\n\n198\n00:09:09.525 --> 00:09:14.325\nthey just made this as part of\ntheir dashboard, if you wanna say.\n\n199\n00:09:14.325 --> 00:09:19.418\nAnd then, of course, it's all to that\nparticular data, so if this one up to\n\n200\n00:09:19.418 --> 00:09:24.768\n$100, it changed here, it's gonna\nchange there, and so on and so forth.\n\n201\n00:09:24.768 --> 00:09:28.137\nI thought that was just\nkind of more on that whole,\n\n202\n00:09:28.137 --> 00:09:31.437\ncreate a dashboard idea,\nthat was pretty cute.\n\n203\n00:09:31.437 --> 00:09:34.227\nSo those are spark lines, fun stuff, and\n\n204\n00:09:34.227 --> 00:09:37.400\nthat's really all there\nis with spark lines.\n\n205\n00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.145\n[LAUGH] Now, I put timelines in\nthe same episode, just because I said,\n\n206\n00:09:41.145 --> 00:09:43.058\nthey're right next to each other.\n\n207\n00:09:43.058 --> 00:09:47.108\n&gt;&gt; Lines.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But the thing about timelines,\n\n208\n00:09:47.108 --> 00:09:51.727\none is that,\nyou have to have a date in your data,\n\n209\n00:09:51.727 --> 00:09:56.706\nbecause that's the whole thing about time-\n&gt;&gt; That doesn't make\n\n210\n00:09:56.706 --> 00:09:57.453\nany sense, Von [LAUGH].\n\n211\n00:09:57.453 --> 00:09:59.970\n&gt;&gt; Right, [LAUGH] I knew you were\ntalking about timeline, you got to have-\n\n212\n00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:01.682\n&gt;&gt; You got to have time,\n\n213\n00:10:01.682 --> 00:10:07.309\nyou got to have some sort of relative\nmeasurement of linear movement.\n\n214\n00:10:07.309 --> 00:10:11.190\n&gt;&gt; If you don't have this, it's not gonna\ndo anything for you, that's one of them.\n\n215\n00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:16.439\nThe other thing is that it has to\nbe associated with a pivot table or\n\n216\n00:10:16.439 --> 00:10:20.646\na pivot chart,\nit can't be on a regular set of data.\n\n217\n00:10:20.646 --> 00:10:25.230\nSo that's why on this particular\nworksheet, I have a data tape, what\n\n218\n00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:29.984\nis this, this is a pivot table, [LAUGH] so\nI went ahead and made this here.\n\n219\n00:10:29.984 --> 00:10:34.564\nBut the whole idea of a timeline,\nso if you have those two pieces,\n\n220\n00:10:34.564 --> 00:10:39.894\nyou can say, well, what I'd really like\nto see whatever this pivot table or\n\n221\n00:10:39.894 --> 00:10:43.090\npivot chart is doing,\nbased on a date range.\n\n222\n00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:44.590\nIt's kind of like slicers, remember,\n\n223\n00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:48.670\nI'm throwing the slicers back\nin this episode as well.\n\n224\n00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:50.420\nIf you've seen it in another one,\nthat's great,\n\n225\n00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:54.930\nI'm going to add it back in right after\nthis particular timeline, just for fun.\n\n226\n00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:57.320\nThrow it all over the place,\nbecause they really are pretty neat.\n\n227\n00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:03.130\nBut this is where I wanna set a range,\nso you have to have this, okay, perfect.\n\n228\n00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:08.112\nNow if I come over here to analyze, so\nI clicked anywhere within the pivot table,\n\n229\n00:11:08.112 --> 00:11:13.115\nand then on the analyze, there is a,\nI thought there was, well, you know what?\n\n230\n00:11:13.115 --> 00:11:16.395\nIt doesn't matter, cuz we'll just\ncome over here to insert, [LAUGH] so\n\n231\n00:11:16.395 --> 00:11:17.990\nwe'll go to insert, there it is.\n\n232\n00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:21.303\nWe're gonna enter a timeline, and just to\nshow you on this tooltip, it does say,\n\n233\n00:11:21.303 --> 00:11:22.755\nif you can't read it on the screen.\n\n234\n00:11:22.755 --> 00:11:27.695\nIt says, timelines make it faster and\neasier to select time periods,\n\n235\n00:11:27.695 --> 00:11:32.650\nin order to filter pivot tables,\npivot charts, and cube functions.\n\n236\n00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:37.550\nDoesn't say anything about\na regular table or regular data.\n\n237\n00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:42.920\nWith that selected,\nlet's go ahead and click the button.\n\n238\n00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:47.420\nIt is pulling from the original\ndata source of my pivot table,\n\n239\n00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:49.560\nwhich is right in here.\n\n240\n00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:53.580\nMy finger's still pointing to my screen,\nsorry, this guy right over here, so\n\n241\n00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.660\nI choose that, yes, it does have a date.\n\n242\n00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:59.550\nCuz we have our properly headed headers,\nwe click OK,\n\n243\n00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:01.930\nand then it adds this little guy.\n\n244\n00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:06.260\nNow I'm gonna try and make this a little\nbit bigger, and I'm also gonna zoom in, so\n\n245\n00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:07.790\nwe can see this a little bit better.\n\n246\n00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:12.380\nSo you could see that it's got this, well,\ntimeline, and right now, it comes in, and\n\n247\n00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.790\nnotice it does have\nthe contextual tab up at the top,\n\n248\n00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:17.420\nwhere it has where you can\nformat it with some styles.\n\n249\n00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:21.840\nAnd it does have over here some\ndifferent options, like the header,\n\n250\n00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.740\nwhich is the date column, the scroll bar,\nwhich you want to have a scroll bar, and\n\n251\n00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:26.990\nso on and so forth.\n\n252\n00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:31.230\nBut over here on the right hand side,\nthis is where you can start filtering\n\n253\n00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:34.680\ndown where you are,\nbecause this information just to, here,\n\n254\n00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:38.280\nlet me zoom back out just for\na minute, so you can get an idea.\n\n255\n00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:42.220\nCuz it's always good to know your data,\nthese dates,\n\n256\n00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:45.580\nthey only go from January to March.\n\n257\n00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:50.050\nI was trying to keep it within the first\nquarter, so that's the only dates.\n\n258\n00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:54.230\nThat's the only range I have within\nthis particular data set, so\n\n259\n00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:57.740\njust wanted to clarify that\nbefore we go any further.\n\n260\n00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:01.350\nSo because I have that, and let's zoom in\nso you can see this a little bit better.\n\n261\n00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:04.938\nAnd watching our pivot table and\nour timeline, so\n\n262\n00:13:04.938 --> 00:13:09.560\nI don't have 12 months, so\nthis isn't gonna make any sense.\n\n263\n00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:13.164\nBut you can notice that it does\ngo from January through December.\n\n264\n00:13:13.164 --> 00:13:17.762\nThat's fine, well, what if I went ahead\nand changed it here, cuz depending on how\n\n265\n00:13:17.762 --> 00:13:22.510\nlong or how far apart your range is, maybe\nyou want months, I wanna go with quarters.\n\n266\n00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:26.710\nSo now let's say, okay,\nhere's by quarters, let me go by days.\n\n267\n00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:28.830\nOkay, now it's gonna go through,\nand notice now,\n\n268\n00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:32.590\nthe slider's gonna go all the way through\nyour different months and everything.\n\n269\n00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:36.450\nWell, that's a lot, but I do wanna set,\nI scrolled all the way to the beginning,\n\n270\n00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:40.850\nI wanna see, let's go with\nJanuary 1st through January 15th.\n\n271\n00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:47.170\nWithin that particular timeline, What\ndid my data do, what does my data say?\n\n272\n00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:50.740\nSo the cool thing is, you see this logo,\nit's really hard to see.\n\n273\n00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:55.690\nBut it's tiny, tiny gray, at the very,\nvery ends, I call it the end of the worm.\n\n274\n00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:59.489\nSo you take the end of the worm, but\nthink about, December 2017's way,\n\n275\n00:13:59.489 --> 00:14:01.090\nway over there on the scroll.\n\n276\n00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:04.170\nI don't wanna have to go move it all out,\nthat's okay,\n\n277\n00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:07.520\nyou don't have to go by\nthe ends of the worm.\n\n278\n00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.060\nYou just grab here, and just click, hold,\n\n279\n00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:11.910\nand drag, and say,\nI want this amount of time.\n\n280\n00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:14.336\nYou let go, and\nthen look at what the data does.\n\n281\n00:14:14.336 --> 00:14:15.187\n&gt;&gt; That's a nice feature.\n\n282\n00:14:15.187 --> 00:14:16.723\n&gt;&gt; It's very similar to that slicer.\n\n283\n00:14:16.723 --> 00:14:19.747\n&gt;&gt; It's like it's hiding in there,\nyou had to kinda point that out,\n\n284\n00:14:19.747 --> 00:14:21.811\nI don't know that I\nwould have noticed that.\n\n285\n00:14:21.811 --> 00:14:24.556\n&gt;&gt; Well, [LAUGH] and\nI also discovered it by accident.\n\n286\n00:14:24.556 --> 00:14:25.895\n&gt;&gt; Did you?\n&gt;&gt; Because I was like, gosh,\n\n287\n00:14:25.895 --> 00:14:28.838\nyou gotta go all the way out to the end\nand pull the end of the worm in, and,\n\n288\n00:14:28.838 --> 00:14:30.060\nokay, now you gotta go here.\n\n289\n00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.819\nAnd then I kind of just\naccidentally clicked,\n\n290\n00:14:32.819 --> 00:14:34.611\nand I'm like, whoa-\n&gt;&gt; It did this.\n\n291\n00:14:34.611 --> 00:14:38.162\n&gt;&gt; That's even better, [LAUGH] so it was\none of those for me too, I was like, yeah,\n\n292\n00:14:38.162 --> 00:14:39.170\nthat's how you do it.\n\n293\n00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.979\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, those little happy mistakes,\nright, yeah, that's nice stuff.\n\n294\n00:14:41.979 --> 00:14:44.443\n&gt;&gt; Because you know how we learn things,\n\n295\n00:14:44.443 --> 00:14:49.310\nI don't necessarily read the instructions,\n[LAUGH] just go in and play.\n\n296\n00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:53.237\nAnd then you're like, [SOUND] yeah,\nso, that's how we do it, guys [LAUGH].\n\n297\n00:14:53.237 --> 00:14:55.045\n&gt;&gt; Unless you're setting up Open VPN,\n\n298\n00:14:55.045 --> 00:14:57.515\nthen the instructions\nare very necessary [LAUGH].\n\n299\n00:14:57.515 --> 00:15:00.363\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, [LAUGH] certain things,\nyes, read the white pages,\n\n300\n00:15:00.363 --> 00:15:01.097\nit will help you.\n\n301\n00:15:01.097 --> 00:15:03.888\n[LAUGH] There's a lot of times\nof in Excel or any other things,\n\n302\n00:15:03.888 --> 00:15:06.432\nlike how I leaned Photoshop is,\nget in there and play.\n\n303\n00:15:06.432 --> 00:15:08.525\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, move sliders and\ncheck checkmarks and\n\n304\n00:15:08.525 --> 00:15:10.772\nstart swiping across the screen,\nand see what it does.\n\n305\n00:15:10.772 --> 00:15:13.697\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and then learn it backwards, and\nthen when you learn it the real way,\n\n306\n00:15:13.697 --> 00:15:16.520\nyou're like, why didn't I just go\nthis way from the beginning [LAUGH]?\n\n307\n00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.220\n&gt;&gt; Well it's in this\nbook right here [LAUGH],\n\n308\n00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:21.094\nit tells me I should do that [LAUGH].\n\n309\n00:15:21.094 --> 00:15:24.470\n&gt;&gt; Hey, that's why we have ITPRO.TV,\nOfficeProTV, CreativeProTV.\n\n310\n00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.210\nSo that's why you got us,\nguys [LAUGH] so anyway, back to here.\n\n311\n00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:32.292\nYou can see, it's pretty cool to\nwhere it's like, well, let me see,\n\n312\n00:15:32.292 --> 00:15:38.669\nthen, let's see January, let's say the\n20th through the 29th, or what have you.\n\n313\n00:15:38.669 --> 00:15:42.233\nSo you can click, hold, and drag,\ngo with that, but then that's where,\n\n314\n00:15:42.233 --> 00:15:43.830\nif you come back out to the month.\n\n315\n00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:48.439\nWhat if I say, I only wanna see\nmonths January and February?\n\n316\n00:15:48.439 --> 00:15:51.544\nOkay, well then, change the filter here,\ncome out to the months,\n\n317\n00:15:51.544 --> 00:15:53.029\ndo the click, hold, and drag.\n\n318\n00:15:53.029 --> 00:15:57.602\nThere we go, now I can see January and\nFebruary, versus February and March, or\n\n319\n00:15:57.602 --> 00:16:01.740\nMarch and April and May, well,\nthere's no April and May in there.\n\n320\n00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:04.030\nBut I can go ahead and\nput that in my timeline,\n\n321\n00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:06.520\neven though my data doesn't\neven go out to May.\n\n322\n00:16:08.145 --> 00:16:13.140\nCuz it's not showing me anything\nhere that really indicates\n\n323\n00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:16.150\nthere's no dates that say April and May.\n\n324\n00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:19.930\nYou just gave it a range, and\nit's showing you the numbers.\n\n325\n00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:24.100\nSo if I went out and did May through July,\nthen it's just gonna be zero.\n\n326\n00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.130\nCuz it didn't meet that\nparticular criteria.\n\n327\n00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:28.330\nSo, again, know your information.\n\n328\n00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:29.600\nKnow what you're looking for.\n\n329\n00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.006\nYou can click all over the place, but\n\n330\n00:16:32.006 --> 00:16:35.120\nit's not gonna give you\nwhat you need out of it.\n\n331\n00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.200\nSo, that's what the timeline does,\npretty neat.\n\n332\n00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.750\nFilters by date, so you can go ahead and\n\n333\n00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:43.960\nclear it, but it does have to be\nwith a pivot table or pivot chart.\n\n334\n00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:49.190\nJust for demonstration purposes,\nif I went out to my sparklines and\n\n335\n00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:55.460\nI click in here, and want to go insert\na timeline, this is what you'll see.\n\n336\n00:16:55.460 --> 00:17:01.240\nIt's like, I can't make a connection,\nI don't understand where this lives.\n\n337\n00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.630\nSo that's what we've got.\n\n338\n00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:04.410\nNow, I did want to throw in slicers,\n\n339\n00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:07.220\ncuz I've mentioned it a couple\nof times this episode.\n\n340\n00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.940\nCuz maybe you're watching\nit in a different order and\n\n341\n00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:12.440\nyou haven't seen another\nepisode where we did slicers.\n\n342\n00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.600\nI think that was in pivot\ncharts is what we just did it.\n\n343\n00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.857\nSo with a slicer table,\nnow this is just formatted as a table.\n\n344\n00:17:17.857 --> 00:17:22.185\nI just took a regular range of cells and\ndid the Home, I did the Format as Table,\n\n345\n00:17:22.185 --> 00:17:23.509\nand that's what I did.\n\n346\n00:17:23.509 --> 00:17:26.696\nNow back,\njust as a review of what do tables do,\n\n347\n00:17:26.696 --> 00:17:32.452\nthe cool thing is up at the Table Tools, I\nlove Total Rows, I think they're awesome.\n\n348\n00:17:32.452 --> 00:17:36.974\nAll that does, and let me go ahead and\nmake that a little bit bigger, is that it\n\n349\n00:17:36.974 --> 00:17:41.579\nadds an extra row at the bottom, that\ndoes all of these dynamic calculations.\n\n350\n00:17:41.579 --> 00:17:46.554\nAnd I can come down into that total row\nand say, let's go with the Quantity, and\n\n351\n00:17:46.554 --> 00:17:48.790\nlet's go ahead and do a Sum on this.\n\n352\n00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:51.700\nSo you go ahead and add,\nwhat are known as subtotals.\n\n353\n00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:58.203\nIt has a whole reference chart to\nspecific functions within a table.\n\n354\n00:17:58.203 --> 00:18:00.276\nYou don't have to know the syntax really.\n\n355\n00:18:00.276 --> 00:18:03.259\nJust know that that's what you could do,\nand so\n\n356\n00:18:03.259 --> 00:18:06.690\nI can do counts and\nall sorts of fun stuff in here.\n\n357\n00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.993\nSo yeah, I can put a count on\nthe zip code or the date field.\n\n358\n00:18:09.993 --> 00:18:11.731\nJust because I wanna see that.\n\n359\n00:18:11.731 --> 00:18:15.446\nNow the neat thing with the tables is if\nI then say, all right, let's go ahead and\n\n360\n00:18:15.446 --> 00:18:18.289\nsee my sales reps,\nthat's what those little dropdowns are,\n\n361\n00:18:18.289 --> 00:18:21.813\nI filter that information to see,\nwell, let's just see what Daniel does.\n\n362\n00:18:21.813 --> 00:18:26.154\nAnd I click OK, and then my total row\nwill change dynamically with that.\n\n363\n00:18:26.154 --> 00:18:27.861\nLove that, super cool.\n\n364\n00:18:27.861 --> 00:18:30.826\nDefinitely love me some tables, all right?\n\n365\n00:18:30.826 --> 00:18:34.022\nWell, that slicer that we had\nadded on that PivotChart,\n\n366\n00:18:34.022 --> 00:18:35.830\nyou can add it right in here too.\n\n367\n00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:40.610\nIt's right actually here on the Design\ntab of the table tools, and\n\n368\n00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:42.960\nI insert it, and\nthat was the remote controls.\n\n369\n00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.650\nWe called them remote controls\nin the other episode,\n\n370\n00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:49.115\nof where instead of coming up to these\ndropdowns and doing the drop and\n\n371\n00:18:49.115 --> 00:18:52.542\nchanging all of my filter fields,\nyou make it just little buttons.\n\n372\n00:18:52.542 --> 00:18:57.445\nThat I can say, let's filter by category,\nI think any other one, let's do category,\n\n373\n00:18:57.445 --> 00:18:59.578\nand then let's do State just for fun.\n\n374\n00:18:59.578 --> 00:19:03.381\nYou can add as many remote controls\non this data, as you want,\n\n375\n00:19:03.381 --> 00:19:05.808\nyou click OK and then, there they are.\n\n376\n00:19:05.808 --> 00:19:10.390\nThey're just little buttons over here,\nto where I could say,\n\n377\n00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:14.205\nlet's go ahead and now,\nsee, I did category.\n\n378\n00:19:14.205 --> 00:19:15.111\nI didn't do salesperson.\n\n379\n00:19:15.111 --> 00:19:15.858\n&gt;&gt; No.\n[LAUGH]\n\n380\n00:19:15.858 --> 00:19:16.676\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so, well,\n\n381\n00:19:16.676 --> 00:19:18.710\nlet's see what our clothing sales are.\n\n382\n00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:21.240\nAnd then, there it is,\nI can see everything.\n\n383\n00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:25.594\nAnd notice that it does an autofilter\nhere of, in my clothing,\n\n384\n00:19:25.594 --> 00:19:29.630\nI didn't have any sales in California or\nNorth Carolina.\n\n385\n00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:32.640\nBut then let's go ahead and\nsee what the Florida ones are.\n\n386\n00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:36.642\nYou can see all the same things you\nwere doing by the filters up at the top,\n\n387\n00:19:36.642 --> 00:19:39.145\nyou can do with buttons\nover here on the side.\n\n388\n00:19:39.145 --> 00:19:40.627\nThey're just slicers.\n\n389\n00:19:40.627 --> 00:19:44.489\nThey're just showing me slices of that\ninformation, slice out some things.\n\n390\n00:19:44.489 --> 00:19:46.334\nIt's a cool little filter.\n\n391\n00:19:46.334 --> 00:19:49.299\nAnd then we can go ahead and\nclear all of those, and\n\n392\n00:19:49.299 --> 00:19:51.780\nthen you can also do a multi-selection.\n\n393\n00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:55.866\nIf you choose this little button\nright here of Multiselect,\n\n394\n00:19:55.866 --> 00:19:59.320\ncuz maybe I wanna just see\nwhat my sales are in here.\n\n395\n00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.940\nActually, it's easier to do it this way.\n\n396\n00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:05.510\nGo ahead and clear out the fields, choose\nFlorida, so it takes everything else out.\n\n397\n00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:10.059\nThen turn the Multiselect on,\nlet's see in Florida and New York.\n\n398\n00:20:10.059 --> 00:20:14.908\nOkay, now I can see that it did that\nfilter right there in my state field,\n\n399\n00:20:14.908 --> 00:20:17.784\nand notice it just did those buttons here.\n\n400\n00:20:17.784 --> 00:20:19.902\nIt's just a little bit easier.\n\n401\n00:20:19.902 --> 00:20:24.837\nAnd that's what slicers do on a table and\nany other things that you could\n\n402\n00:20:24.837 --> 00:20:29.706\nadd it to as well, and I really,\nreally love this and I know you do too.\n\n403\n00:20:29.706 --> 00:20:31.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know I'm a fan.\n\n404\n00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:33.290\nI am sold out hardcore.\n\n405\n00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:34.670\nI'm marked out for slashers.\n\n406\n00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:37.636\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I wanted to just go ahead and\nthrow that into this episode,\n\n407\n00:20:37.636 --> 00:20:39.680\nbecause they are all\nright next to each other.\n\n408\n00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:40.557\nThey're very close.\n\n409\n00:20:40.557 --> 00:20:44.269\nYou can see sparklines, slicer, timeline.\n\n410\n00:20:44.269 --> 00:20:48.253\nAnd so that's why I lumped them\nall together in this episode and\n\n411\n00:20:48.253 --> 00:20:49.991\nthey're all really cute.\n\n412\n00:20:49.991 --> 00:20:53.191\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Whatever you say.\n\n413\n00:20:53.191 --> 00:20:54.280\nWhatever helps you.\n\n414\n00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:55.860\nI think they're cool,\nshe thinks they're cute.\n\n415\n00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:57.850\nMaybe you think they're stupendous or\n\n416\n00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:02.240\nsomething other adjectives out\nthere that are waiting to be used.\n\n417\n00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:02.920\nVonne, thanks so\n\n418\n00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:07.110\nmuch for showing us how to use\nthe slicer again, because it's awesome.\n\n419\n00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:10.060\nThe timeline and also sparklines,\nI like that as well.\n\n420\n00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:11.353\nIt's a very cool feature.\n\n421\n00:21:11.353 --> 00:21:12.980\nWe do appreciate you stopping by.\n\n422\n00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.488\nBut I'm looking at the clock and\nI'm looking at the notes, and\n\n423\n00:21:15.488 --> 00:21:17.486\nit looks like both have\ndwindled down to nothing.\n\n424\n00:21:17.486 --> 00:21:20.355\nSo it's time for us to, well, sign off.\n\n425\n00:21:20.355 --> 00:21:22.318\nFor OfficeProTV,\nwe do thank you for watching.\n\n426\n00:21:22.318 --> 00:21:23.700\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n427\n00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:24.570\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne

Don't worry,\nI had to Google that one, too.\n\n24\n00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.487\nOkay, so I have a choropleth map for us.\n\n25\n00:01:07.487 --> 00:01:11.850\nThrough the wonderful world of the oracle,\nthe internet.\n\n26\n00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:12.680\n&gt;&gt; The oracle.\n\n27\n00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.080\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so this is, and when I saw this,\n\n28\n00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.208\nthis picture of Australia,\nwe've seen this before, right?\n\n29\n00:01:19.208 --> 00:01:23.059\nThese are just one of those things\nwhere usually see where population,\n\n30\n00:01:23.059 --> 00:01:26.653\nit seems a lot around like politics time,\nlike here's this map and\n\n31\n00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:29.179\nall these different colors but\nyou know what?\n\n32\n00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:31.420\nWe are staying away from that so [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good, yeah.\n\n33\n00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.172\n&gt;&gt; Yes but\nthat's normally where you see it.\n\n34\n00:01:33.172 --> 00:01:35.683\nLike on election night where\nthey're telling you what all\n\n35\n00:01:35.683 --> 00:01:38.554\nthe different counties are voting by and\nall that kinda stuff and so\n\n36\n00:01:38.554 --> 00:01:40.330\nyou see these different things.\n\n37\n00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.560\nI see these on the news a lot, too.\n\n38\n00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.144\nSo you've got this and\nit is part of the thematic map.\n\n39\n00:01:46.144 --> 00:01:50.472\nNow this is also, where we're doing\na little vocabulary lesson right in here,\n\n40\n00:01:50.472 --> 00:01:51.980\nwe have the Isarithmic.\n\n41\n00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.255\nI believe I pronounced that correctly.\n\n42\n00:01:54.255 --> 00:01:55.600\n&gt;&gt; Isa [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n43\n00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.150\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Great, I got it.\n\n44\n00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.172\n&gt;&gt; Another cereal, right?\n\n45\n00:01:58.172 --> 00:01:58.790\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n46\n00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and so we've got here.\n\n47\n00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.250\n&gt;&gt; Isarithmic, yes, I like it.\n\n48\n00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.550\n&gt;&gt; I think that's what we're gonna talk.\n\n49\n00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:04.650\nIt's a heat map.\n\n50\n00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.315\n&gt;&gt; And this is where you\nhave different variables.\n\n51\n00:02:06.315 --> 00:02:10.365\nThis is when you think about the different\ntemperatures and all that kind of stuff.\n\n52\n00:02:10.365 --> 00:02:14.165\nSo I'm saying, okay, I've seen these\nthings, kinda like hot spots, right?\n\n53\n00:02:14.165 --> 00:02:15.385\nAnd then it has a little map.\n\n54\n00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:19.155\nNow we're not making this exactly okay so\nbut I just wanted to kinda throw that out\n\n55\n00:02:19.155 --> 00:02:22.370\nthere because if you start clicking\nthrough these different words in\n\n56\n00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.435\nthe Wikipedia you get around to that and\nI just thought it was fun.\n\n57\n00:02:25.435 --> 00:02:28.450\nI was Was also really trying\nto help myself pronounce it\n\n58\n00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.390\ncorrectly as we're going\nthrough these different places.\n\n59\n00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.050\nNow I have some other things\nabout map projections but\n\n60\n00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.340\nwe'll get to that in just a little bit.\n\n61\n00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.820\nBecause what we're gonna do is we\nare going to create a filled map in Excel.\n\n62\n00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.570\nAnd that's what it's actually called,\n\n63\n00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.030\nI'm just gonna jump over really quickly\nto show you where the button is.\n\n64\n00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.750\nOn the insert,\n\n65\n00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.160\ncuz we've been talking about different\ntypes of charts in this particular series.\n\n66\n00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.420\nWe did like a pie chart, and\nwe did a clustered column, and\n\n67\n00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.010\nwe have these map charts, and\nnotice that we have filled map.\n\n68\n00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.680\nAnd that's pretty cool.\n\n69\n00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Now it's pulling this up there right\n\n70\n00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.640\nnow because it thinks it sees the data,\n\n71\n00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.340\nbut I'm gonna need to get\na little more information first.\n\n72\n00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.681\n&gt;&gt; Well Vonne,\nthat looks like a choropleth map.\n\n73\n00:03:10.681 --> 00:03:12.613\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It is, it definitely is.\n\n74\n00:03:12.613 --> 00:03:16.209\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes it's feeling in the different\n\n75\n00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.070\nareas, the geographical\nlocations based on your data.\n\n76\n00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.690\nSo, it's pretty awesome.\n\n77\n00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.233\nTo be able to do this, but\n\n78\n00:03:24.233 --> 00:03:28.279\nI will give you a couple little\ntidbits of information on my work.\n\n79\n00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:33.090\nHey, I don't see a max button,\nthis is only for Office 365 subscribers.\n\n80\n00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.170\nSo if if you don't have a subscription,\nyou won't see this button, so\n\n81\n00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.190\nsorry about that.\n\n82\n00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.240\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n83\n00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.990\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot of different\nthings in here that\n\n84\n00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:46.330\nyou do have to have a subscription for it\nto have those kind of advanced features.\n\n85\n00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.940\n&gt;&gt; But that's what we're going to do.\n\n86\n00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.945\nAnd you do need to have of\ncourse geographical data.\n\n87\n00:03:51.945 --> 00:03:54.690\n&gt;&gt; In the information that\nyou're trying to chart.\n\n88\n00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.930\nSo for example, here I have US states and\nI have cat lovers and I have dog lovers.\n\n89\n00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.570\nAnd I\"ve got all the different capitals\nof the states down through here, so\n\n90\n00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.920\nyou can see we've got Augusta, Maine and\nBoston, Massachusetts and everything and\n\n91\n00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.580\nthey're in different columns,\nwhich is fine.\n\n92\n00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.540\nSo as long as I have that\nkind of information and\n\n93\n00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.610\na single variable, keep that in mind,\nif you're like, what do you mean?\n\n94\n00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:20.510\nWell, I have Alabama once,\nI have Alaska once,\n\n95\n00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.550\nI have Arkansas once, so\njust keep that in mind because\n\n96\n00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.461\nI'll show you an example later like\nit doesn't like to consolidate.\n\n97\n00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.250\nSo you're data has to lend itself to be\nable to just go ahead and make this map.\n\n98\n00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.580\nAnd then once and as along as it does,\nit really is that simple.\n\n99\n00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.727\nHow many times have I said that, y'all?\n\n100\n00:04:37.727 --> 00:04:39.220\nSo [LAUGH].\n\n101\n00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.075\nWe're gonna go ahead and select.\n\n102\n00:04:40.075 --> 00:04:40.813\n&gt;&gt; Well, you make it simple.\n\n103\n00:04:40.813 --> 00:04:42.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're awesome.\n\n104\n00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.860\n&gt;&gt; Well Excel makes it simple for me.\n\n105\n00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.850\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nExcel does too make it simple.\n\n106\n00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.310\n&gt;&gt; But it is the key of making sure\nyou're data is created properly.\n\n107\n00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.930\nI will tell you that is one of\nthe biggest things that I have always.\n\n108\n00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.860\nI watch tutorials, I tell you all that, I\nwatch them and like okay now I'm gonna go\n\n109\n00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.312\nahead and do something on my data and\nI'm like, that's not working.\n\n110\n00:04:58.312 --> 00:05:00.356\nIt's because my data doesn't,\n\n111\n00:05:00.356 --> 00:05:04.444\nit's not set up like the same way to\nlend itself to being that easy so\n\n112\n00:05:04.444 --> 00:05:08.763\nthat's really some of the hardest\nparts of like, I'm gonna do that.\n\n113\n00:05:08.763 --> 00:05:13.360\nBut my numbers don't add up\nto being able to do that.\n\n114\n00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.150\nSo just try to keep that in mind.\n\n115\n00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.760\nI struggle with it too but you know\nthere'll be places where you can have it.\n\n116\n00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.629\nFor example, like states and cats.\n\n117\n00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:22.550\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n118\n00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.220\n&gt;&gt; So\nof course that's what you're gonna chart.\n\n119\n00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.371\nSo I'm gonna come over here and\nselect all that information.\n\n120\n00:05:27.371 --> 00:05:29.440\nBut you're choosing cat and dogs.\n\n121\n00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.780\nJust roll with me for a little bit.\n\n122\n00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.120\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nuse this field maps, and\n\n123\n00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.910\nyou can see that, yes,\nit does indeed go ahead and chart out.\n\n124\n00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.070\nAnd you can see the legend right there,\nit says, Cat Lovers.\n\n125\n00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.750\nSweet.\n\n126\n00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:47.315\nSo it went ahead and took and\ngot my category axis and my series axis.\n\n127\n00:05:47.315 --> 00:05:50.550\nSo let's go ahead and look at that\nselect data so that you can see\n\n128\n00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.590\nwhat's being pulled and why I'm gonna\nactually have to take out one of them.\n\n129\n00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.850\nBecause it's just showing cat lovers and I\nprobably could have just stopped there and\n\n130\n00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.190\njust said I don't need to go\nall the way over to dogs.\n\n131\n00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:07.570\nBecause if you think we're gonna have one\nchart for cats and another chart for dogs.\n\n132\n00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:08.450\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And just like you\n\n133\n00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.660\nsee in all those different ones,\nlike how many people like ice cream,\n\n134\n00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.500\nand how many people like\nstrawberry shortcakes.\n\n135\n00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.540\nI'm just making it up.\n\n136\n00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:17.650\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or yogurt.\n\n137\n00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.630\n&gt;&gt; There you go, yes, yes frozen\nyogurt versus ice cream, perfect.\n\n138\n00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:22.695\n&gt;&gt; Ice cream every time, so.\n\n139\n00:06:22.695 --> 00:06:25.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you're gonna see that my series.\n\n140\n00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.010\nI really didn't need a second series.\n\n141\n00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.670\nSo I'm gonna take this dog lovers and\nI'm gonna go ahead and remove it.\n\n142\n00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.650\nBut don't worry,\nI'll come back around to you dog lovers.\n\n143\n00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:37.180\nAnd my category access has got\nall of my state and cities.\n\n144\n00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.910\nI click OK and\nthat didn't really change anything.\n\n145\n00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.270\nBut I wanted to at least show you that\nyou can still go into the select data and\n\n146\n00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.320\nbe able to change it just\nlike you would anything else.\n\n147\n00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.220\nSo, for example if I wanted\nto input the same stuff.\n\n148\n00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:52.870\nLet's go ahead and\n\n149\n00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:58.940\nselect this one more time because I wanna\nget like the dog lovers in there as well.\n\n150\n00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:03.780\nSo we'll go back up to insert and\nwe will go to our field maps and\n\n151\n00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:04.880\nwe'll say, there it is.\n\n152\n00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.315\nAnd now this is one where I don't\nwant the cats, I want the dogs.\n\n153\n00:07:08.315 --> 00:07:10.620\nSo come back in to select data.\n\n154\n00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:16.900\nRemove the cats and then go ahead and\nnow we just have dogs right there.\n\n155\n00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:17.410\nIt's there.\n\n156\n00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:18.243\nIt's just a little bit further.\n\n157\n00:07:18.243 --> 00:07:20.370\nRight now, they kinda look the same.\n\n158\n00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:21.915\nBut if you started looking at-\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n159\n00:07:21.915 --> 00:07:23.450\nthere's some differences there, yeah.\n\n160\n00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:26.499\n&gt;&gt; So you can see even right there,\nwith the state of Texas and\n\n161\n00:07:26.499 --> 00:07:27.681\nthe state of Florida,\n\n162\n00:07:27.681 --> 00:07:31.994\nthey're different colors because they\nhave different amounts of dogs and cats.\n\n163\n00:07:31.994 --> 00:07:35.080\nPretty cool that it can go ahead and\njust do all this.\n\n164\n00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.729\nNow it is powered by Bing.\n\n165\n00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:40.317\nSo it is gonna have some of that services\nin the background where you're gonna need\n\n166\n00:07:40.317 --> 00:07:41.670\nit connected to the internet.\n\n167\n00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.970\nAnd it's gonna need to know\nwhere all the stuff is.\n\n168\n00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.239\nAnd your data has to\nbe organized properly.\n\n169\n00:07:46.239 --> 00:07:48.437\nI'll show you another example later.\n\n170\n00:07:48.437 --> 00:07:49.950\nBut that's pretty cool.\n\n171\n00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:50.598\nI just went ahead.\n\n172\n00:07:50.598 --> 00:07:52.489\n&gt;&gt; It is very cool.\n&gt;&gt; And made a map.\n\n173\n00:07:52.489 --> 00:07:57.517\nAnd I can see all the different colors\nof the ranges of lower We got people in\n\n174\n00:07:57.517 --> 00:08:03.040\nGeorgia don't like cats as much as\npeople in Maine cuz this is dark blue.\n\n175\n00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.377\nSo, we've got some different things now.\n\n176\n00:08:04.377 --> 00:08:08.952\nNow just like with any chart you can start\nmanipulating this information here and\n\n177\n00:08:08.952 --> 00:08:10.303\nlike changing colors.\n\n178\n00:08:10.303 --> 00:08:14.010\nYou have your styles just like\nyou have with any other chart.\n\n179\n00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:16.470\nSo maybe you wanna have\nlike a darker plot area.\n\n180\n00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.070\nYou could change the color.\n\n181\n00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:21.054\nMaybe you don't like blue for\nthe different variations.\n\n182\n00:08:21.054 --> 00:08:25.344\nYou can come into here and change it\nmore over into orange or yellow or\n\n183\n00:08:25.344 --> 00:08:29.070\nany type of color that you would\nlike it to be changed into.\n\n184\n00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:32.030\nYou also have chart elements, okay?\n\n185\n00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:33.150\nWe have the title now.\n\n186\n00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:34.420\nThe title's already there.\n\n187\n00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:38.670\nSo you probably want to go ahead and\nselect this, and just say, Cat.\n\n188\n00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.020\nWe'll try that again.\n\n189\n00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.700\nCat Lovers and then there we go.\n\n190\n00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.202\nWell, I guess we could\ntake out the word Title.\n\n191\n00:08:46.202 --> 00:08:48.580\n[LAUGH] And then some other things.\n\n192\n00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:52.730\nNotice there's not as many different\noptions for chart elements.\n\n193\n00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:55.160\nBut one thing you can\nshow is the data labels.\n\n194\n00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.970\nSo, if I wanted to show\nthe numbers within the states.\n\n195\n00:08:59.262 --> 00:09:02.520\nThere we go, perfect, then I-\n&gt;&gt; That's fantastic, yeah.\n\n196\n00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.260\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty cool.\n\n197\n00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.000\nAnd so, those are the different options.\n\n198\n00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000\nYou can go ahead and\nchange where your legend is.\n\n199\n00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.653\nAnd so, this is just like any\nother chart that you can create.\n\n200\n00:09:10.653 --> 00:09:14.655\nIt's just based on\ngeographical information.\n\n201\n00:09:14.655 --> 00:09:20.305\nAnd just like other charts you can start\nreally getting into formatting the series,\n\n202\n00:09:20.305 --> 00:09:24.751\nthe plot area, the data labels,\nall those different elements of a chart.\n\n203\n00:09:24.751 --> 00:09:27.932\nAnd if this is something you're like\nwhat are you talking about, go back and\n\n204\n00:09:27.932 --> 00:09:31.162\nlook at some of those episodes that we do\nexplain like the anatomy of a chart and\n\n205\n00:09:31.162 --> 00:09:32.223\nsome of the basics of it.\n\n206\n00:09:32.223 --> 00:09:34.496\nSo that's covered in another episode.\n\n207\n00:09:34.496 --> 00:09:35.888\nIf you're going like, wait,\n\n208\n00:09:35.888 --> 00:09:39.102\nI don't know the words that are coming\nout of your mouth don't worry.\n\n209\n00:09:39.102 --> 00:09:40.173\nI don't either sometimes.\n\n210\n00:09:40.173 --> 00:09:42.133\n[LAUGH] So\nwe've got these different things.\n\n211\n00:09:42.133 --> 00:09:45.280\nBut right clicking on\nthese different options.\n\n212\n00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.320\nNow the thing is if I right-click,\nI just right-clicked right away and\n\n213\n00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.820\nI got Format Data Series.\n\n214\n00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:54.400\nIf you had something selected first,\nlike for example, see how now I have this\n\n215\n00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.820\narea selected and then right-click,\nit's just formatting plot area.\n\n216\n00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:03.194\nSo you do kinda have to play around\nin there to get right clicking on\n\n217\n00:10:03.194 --> 00:10:05.663\nthe right thing, and make sure.\n\n218\n00:10:05.663 --> 00:10:06.253\nWait nope.\n\n219\n00:10:06.253 --> 00:10:11.094\nGotta deselect the plot area first, and\nthen right click over one of the states.\n\n220\n00:10:11.094 --> 00:10:13.220\nAnd then you can get\ninto Format Data Series.\n\n221\n00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.120\nIt's just something I\nknow I've run into it.\n\n222\n00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.100\nSo I'm kind of passing along to you all.\n\n223\n00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:21.890\nIs that you just need to kind\nof right click around a lot\n\n224\n00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:23.160\nto find the right pieces.\n\n225\n00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.320\nSo I'm gonna do the Format Data Series.\n\n226\n00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:30.050\n&gt;&gt; And it brings up the panel\nover on the right-hand side.\n\n227\n00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:32.690\nAnd this is where you\nsee the map projection.\n\n228\n00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:35.266\nNow these were the things that,\nwhen I first did this, I was like,\n\n229\n00:10:35.266 --> 00:10:36.658\nI don't know what those words are.\n\n230\n00:10:36.658 --> 00:10:42.363\n[LAUGH] So that's where those kind\nof go back over here to some other.\n\n231\n00:10:42.363 --> 00:10:43.204\nThese are the things.\n\n232\n00:10:43.204 --> 00:10:47.011\nAnd this actually starts to bring me\nback to my childhood where I would,\n\n233\n00:10:47.011 --> 00:10:48.097\nI loved geography.\n\n234\n00:10:48.097 --> 00:10:49.627\nIt was probably my-\n&gt;&gt; I did too actually.\n\n235\n00:10:49.627 --> 00:10:53.220\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it was always,\nwe had the puzzles with all the pieces.\n\n236\n00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.099\nAnd I was a huge puzzle, I still am.\n\n237\n00:10:54.099 --> 00:10:56.831\n&gt;&gt; I love globes, I loved them, yeah.\n\n238\n00:10:56.831 --> 00:10:59.208\nMy God, we had one that lit up,\nwhen I was a kid.\n\n239\n00:10:59.208 --> 00:11:01.180\nAnd I was fascinated with that thing.\n\n240\n00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:04.952\nBut this is how they go ahead and\n\n241\n00:11:04.952 --> 00:11:09.960\nshow us our maps on a flat\nsurface when the world is round.\n\n242\n00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:13.150\nAnd so this is how they\nshow the different ways of,\n\n243\n00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:16.930\nsee right there the Mercator and\nthen the Cassini.\n\n244\n00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:19.456\nI'm sorry if I'm completely\nbutchering this pronunciation.\n\n245\n00:11:19.456 --> 00:11:23.817\n[LAUGH] But it's just different ways of\nhow it goes ahead and shows the states.\n\n246\n00:11:23.817 --> 00:11:27.921\nAnd that's where remember how Greenland\nwas always super, super massive.\n\n247\n00:11:27.921 --> 00:11:32.246\nBut it's really not that big in\nrelation to the rest of the world\n\n248\n00:11:32.246 --> 00:11:35.875\nbecause of the way the globe\nkind of flattens out.\n\n249\n00:11:35.875 --> 00:11:36.855\nRemember that?\n&gt;&gt; And Greenland and\n\n250\n00:11:36.855 --> 00:11:37.565\nIceland are different.\n\n251\n00:11:37.565 --> 00:11:39.415\nGreenland is actually icier than Iceland.\n\n252\n00:11:39.415 --> 00:11:40.975\nIceland's green.\n\n253\n00:11:40.975 --> 00:11:42.605\nThat was cool.\nI remember that when I was a kid when I\n\n254\n00:11:42.605 --> 00:11:43.775\nwas going to geography.\n\n255\n00:11:43.775 --> 00:11:44.747\n&gt;&gt; Wasn't a new, yeah.\n\n256\n00:11:44.747 --> 00:11:46.025\nAnd there's another word.\n\n257\n00:11:46.025 --> 00:11:48.662\n&gt;&gt; They wanted to confuse\nthe people coming in.\n\n258\n00:11:48.662 --> 00:11:50.429\nNo, Greenland, yeah, come onto Greenland.\n\n259\n00:11:50.429 --> 00:11:52.080\nAnd then get to Greenland and [SOUND].\n\n260\n00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:55.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, it's not very green,\nthat's for sure.\n\n261\n00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:58.124\nSo you have all these different\ntypes of map projections.\n\n262\n00:11:58.124 --> 00:12:02.250\nAnd it really just goes with the whole\nshowing a cylinder on a flat surface.\n\n263\n00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:03.750\nSo that's what this is about.\n\n264\n00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:06.804\nAnd actually if you just went down and\nclicked on them, if I went over here,\n\n265\n00:12:06.804 --> 00:12:07.685\nit's gonna change.\n\n266\n00:12:07.685 --> 00:12:09.700\nSee how it changes the perspective?\n\n267\n00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:10.330\n&gt;&gt; Yep, yep, yep.\n\n268\n00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.630\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and\nthen we go over here to the Miller.\n\n269\n00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:16.478\nOkay, that's not much different and\nthen the Albers.\n\n270\n00:12:16.478 --> 00:12:19.038\nOkay, so you can see that we have some\ndifferent ways that it's going to project.\n\n271\n00:12:19.038 --> 00:12:23.582\nNow when we're doing just like for\nexample right here, the United States,\n\n272\n00:12:23.582 --> 00:12:26.920\nit's not gonna show us maybe\nas much kind of variation.\n\n273\n00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:27.925\n&gt;&gt; If you went global you just, yeah.\n\n274\n00:12:27.925 --> 00:12:32.120\n&gt;&gt; Correct,\nwhich is a perfect lead into map area.\n\n275\n00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:36.342\nThe next option down here,\nis that I have it on Automatic.\n\n276\n00:12:36.342 --> 00:12:40.454\nBut if I went with a country and region,\nno, whoops, it's the next one up,\n\n277\n00:12:40.454 --> 00:12:45.149\nmultiple countries and regions, you could\nsee that well now it's gonna show it in\n\n278\n00:12:45.149 --> 00:12:48.330\nthe relationship of where\nit is in North America.\n\n279\n00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.732\nThey don't have any\ncats in Canada [LAUGH]?\n\n280\n00:12:50.732 --> 00:12:53.828\n&gt;&gt; Right, well that's because\nthere's no data in there.\n\n281\n00:12:53.828 --> 00:12:57.911\nSo it's actually showing something\nblank in the areas that, doesn't\n\n282\n00:12:57.911 --> 00:13:00.670\nhave information and that's where if I-\n&gt;&gt; That's why.\n\n283\n00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:04.380\n&gt;&gt; If I chose only regions with data,\nthen it's gonna,\n\n284\n00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:07.500\nit's just gonna show me the United States.\n\n285\n00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.459\n&gt;&gt; I see.\n&gt;&gt; So it's just based on how, I guess you\n\n286\n00:13:10.459 --> 00:13:16.344\nwanna say the scale, how far out you wanna\nshow in relationship as to where we are.\n\n287\n00:13:16.344 --> 00:13:19.000\nBut those are your different map areas.\n\n288\n00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.270\nAnd then the last couple things down\nbelow here, we have Map Labels.\n\n289\n00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:25.410\nAnd you can see that we\nhave Show All versus okay,\n\n290\n00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:29.800\nwell now it's actually showing me all\nof the different data labels that\n\n291\n00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.460\nI could have on here based on\nthe information that it's charting.\n\n292\n00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:36.510\nSo we have can None or Best Fit there.\n\n293\n00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:37.790\nAnd then this is kinda fun.\n\n294\n00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:40.150\nYou can get into how the colors are.\n\n295\n00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:43.000\nYou don't just have to have blue and blue.\n\n296\n00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:50.107\nYou could have yellow and purple,\nwhich would not really go with that.\n\n297\n00:13:50.107 --> 00:13:52.710\nWell, that's just not that bad [LAUGH].\n\n298\n00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:56.875\nSo you can see that you have some\ndifferent options of your lowest and\n\n299\n00:13:56.875 --> 00:13:58.355\nhighest values.\n\n300\n00:13:58.355 --> 00:14:02.035\nThen if you really wanted to have some\nfun you can go into a three-color.\n\n301\n00:14:02.035 --> 00:14:04.618\nAnd then you can get into,\nooh, this is just looking.\n\n302\n00:14:04.618 --> 00:14:06.286\nI'm not even looking at the data.\n\n303\n00:14:06.286 --> 00:14:07.598\nI'm just looking at all the pretty colors.\n\n304\n00:14:07.598 --> 00:14:11.826\n[LAUGH] So you can change like what\ndifferent pieces you want to have.\n\n305\n00:14:11.826 --> 00:14:14.610\nAnd yeah, I like yellow,\ngreen, and purple.\n\n306\n00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:18.340\nI mean, as long as it starts\nactually communicating\n\n307\n00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.590\nwhat you want the chart to say,\nthat was always the thing.\n\n308\n00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:23.660\nAnd we've talked about this in some\nother chart lessons where like, yeah.\n\n309\n00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:25.870\nI can make the ugliest chart in the world.\n\n310\n00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:28.420\nBut it's not gonna really\nconvey the information.\n\n311\n00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:31.150\nThe reason why you make\na chart is to have a quick\n\n312\n00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:33.690\nvisual representation of your data.\n\n313\n00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:37.670\nYou get a little too fancy in here,\nyou start gussying it up too much\n\n314\n00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:40.311\nkinda loses its whole idea\n&gt;&gt; Like your philosophy of\n\n315\n00:14:40.311 --> 00:14:41.216\nthe less is more.\n\n316\n00:14:41.216 --> 00:14:42.710\nI think that makes sense.\n\n317\n00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:44.360\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nDefinitely, so but yeah.\n\n318\n00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.075\nPlaying around with the colors at\nleast you know where it is before you\n\n319\n00:14:47.075 --> 00:14:47.675\ncould find.\n\n320\n00:14:47.675 --> 00:14:51.330\nCuz if you're like I want blue or\norange, then you could go ahead and\n\n321\n00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:55.310\nformat the data series in your chart.\n\n322\n00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:58.610\nAnd so that you can do some fun\nstuff with that, all righty.\n\n323\n00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:03.115\nSo let me move on to a couple of other\nexamples to give you some things to just\n\n324\n00:15:03.115 --> 00:15:04.990\nkinda be aware of.\n\n325\n00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:08.020\nSo, I have here our Florida counties.\n\n326\n00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:11.480\nSo there are 67 counties in Florida.\n\n327\n00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:15.070\nYep, they're from Alachua down to I\nthink Washington is our last one, yeah.\n\n328\n00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:20.230\nAll right, so I just made up\nnumbers of cats in the millions.\n\n329\n00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:22.000\nWe're just kinda using some sample data.\n\n330\n00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.030\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nselect all of this.\n\n331\n00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:27.960\nAnd we're going to come\nback over to Insert.\n\n332\n00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.720\nWe're gonna go over to Maps.\n\n333\n00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.190\nWe're gonna go to Filled Maps.\n\n334\n00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:34.693\nAnd you're like, yeah, wait, what?\n\n335\n00:15:34.693 --> 00:15:38.215\n[LAUGH] It did it, okay?\n\n336\n00:15:38.215 --> 00:15:43.499\nBut the thing is if you notice right\nin here, and I had to look this up so\n\n337\n00:15:43.499 --> 00:15:47.524\nit's like,\nwhy is it pointing some things on Ohio?\n\n338\n00:15:47.524 --> 00:15:48.894\nThis is Florida.\n\n339\n00:15:48.894 --> 00:15:49.594\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n\n340\n00:15:49.594 --> 00:15:53.617\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwell there are some counties in Florida.\n\n341\n00:15:53.617 --> 00:15:54.516\nRight?\n\n342\n00:15:54.516 --> 00:15:57.713\nAnd I probably should have\nbrought up the Google Maps here.\n\n343\n00:15:57.713 --> 00:16:02.904\nBut there is a county in Ohio,\nthere is a Marion County,\n\n344\n00:16:02.904 --> 00:16:07.270\nthere is a Union, Monroe, and Putnam.\n\n345\n00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:11.290\nThose are all counties in\nFlorida that are also in Ohio.\n\n346\n00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:14.330\nSo this is one of those\nthings where Google.\n\n347\n00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:17.420\nSorry, this isn't Google,\nBing, sorry, sorry, Microsoft.\n\n348\n00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:22.330\n[LAUGH] Bing data,\nthe maps data, think about it,\n\n349\n00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:25.030\nthere's four counties\nthat are in both states.\n\n350\n00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:26.160\nSo it's gonna say,\n\n351\n00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:31.430\nwell then we're gonna go ahead and\nchart this information in Ohio too.\n\n352\n00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:32.530\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n353\n00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:36.270\nthat was one of those things like,\nthat's why it's doing this.\n\n354\n00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:38.010\nAnd you'll see this if you go through and\nlook for\n\n355\n00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:40.120\ninformation on these\ntypes of maps in Excel.\n\n356\n00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:43.100\nIt's like,\nsometimes it's not always right.\n\n357\n00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.392\nYou kinda have to help\nit along a little bit.\n\n358\n00:16:46.392 --> 00:16:49.806\nAnd this is where,\nif you give it more pinpointing,\n\n359\n00:16:49.806 --> 00:16:53.310\nif you wanna say,\nin the geographical information.\n\n360\n00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:58.370\nFor example, if I take this and\n\n361\n00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:02.490\nadd just Florida as a whole other column.\n\n362\n00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:05.250\nCuz remember, this one,\nthey were in two different columns.\n\n363\n00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:11.740\nWe had Alabama, and then,\nwell, come on, there we go.\n\n364\n00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.976\n[LAUGH] I knew we had the city over there,\nI had to move over.\n\n365\n00:17:13.976 --> 00:17:16.303\nSo we had the city and the state, so\n\n366\n00:17:16.303 --> 00:17:20.770\nit was giving the reference to Montgomery,\nAlabama.\n\n367\n00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:24.550\nThere's a Gainesville, Florida, there's\nalso a Gainesville, Georgia, right?\n\n368\n00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:26.770\nSo that was where it might confuse itself.\n\n369\n00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:29.830\nBut if you give it more information,\nit will know.\n\n370\n00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:34.447\nIf I come over here with the counties\nin Florida added on to that, and\n\n371\n00:17:34.447 --> 00:17:38.994\nI just go ahead and select all of that,\ncome over to insert the map.\n\n372\n00:17:38.994 --> 00:17:44.765\nSee, now it won't pull from Ohio,\nbecause I have a column that says\n\n373\n00:17:44.765 --> 00:17:49.302\nFlorida Putnam, Florida Union, Florida-\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, right,\n\n374\n00:17:49.302 --> 00:17:49.820\nright, makes sense.\n\n375\n00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:55.148\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you see, so it gives it more\ninformation to understand the differences\n\n376\n00:17:55.148 --> 00:17:59.366\nbetween counties or states or\ncities that are named the same.\n\n377\n00:17:59.366 --> 00:18:02.074\nSo sometimes you might have to give\nit a little bit more help with that.\n\n378\n00:18:02.074 --> 00:18:03.208\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n379\n00:18:03.208 --> 00:18:06.347\n&gt;&gt; So now that I've got my\nFlorida counties right here,\n\n380\n00:18:06.347 --> 00:18:11.050\nyou can see all the different things that\nI need to do, and it does calculate it.\n\n381\n00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:13.480\nAnd I can do the same things\nthat we did before of\n\n382\n00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.880\nadding data labels and\neverything like that.\n\n383\n00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:18.998\nSo this was the example of\ngiving it more map help,\n\n384\n00:18:18.998 --> 00:18:21.853\nif we have names that are the same.\n\n385\n00:18:21.853 --> 00:18:26.059\nAll right, so GNV Zip Code, so\nthese are some ZIP codes that are in\n\n386\n00:18:26.059 --> 00:18:30.510\nGainesville area, or Alachua County,\nwhere we are living.\n\n387\n00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:34.600\nAnd the population, I actually\npulled this right from the ZIP code.\n\n388\n00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:38.110\nSo just to show you, cuz I'm one of those,\nI'll go ahead and make the map.\n\n389\n00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:42.300\nI'm like, wait, is that the actual\nborders of the ZIP codes in Florida?\n\n390\n00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:45.210\nSo I checked it, and it is, right here.\n\n391\n00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:47.934\nAnd I also took some of the population\ninformation from here [LAUGH].\n\n392\n00:18:47.934 --> 00:18:49.989\nAnd just pretend that they're cats,\nso all right.\n\n393\n00:18:49.989 --> 00:18:50.608\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n394\n00:18:50.608 --> 00:18:53.055\nwe're just gonna go ahead and do that.\n\n395\n00:18:53.055 --> 00:18:58.289\nWe're going to pull this same idea,\nselect the information,\n\n396\n00:18:58.289 --> 00:19:01.660\ninsert a filled map, and there it goes.\n\n397\n00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:05.095\nNow, one thing it's doing here,\nit is finding ZIP codes,\n\n398\n00:19:05.095 --> 00:19:08.884\nit's related to Florida, and\nit's pulling this information.\n\n399\n00:19:08.884 --> 00:19:12.835\nAnd I think mine's doing okay,\nthere it goes.\n\n400\n00:19:12.835 --> 00:19:15.188\nI don't know if you can see, see\nthe white stuff popping up right there?\n\n401\n00:19:15.188 --> 00:19:17.396\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna pop up down here,\n\n402\n00:19:17.396 --> 00:19:22.041\nso it's kinda going through the state\nof Florida, cuz it's seeing ZIP codes.\n\n403\n00:19:22.041 --> 00:19:27.456\nSo think about counties, 67, think about\nhow many ZIP codes are in Florida.\n\n404\n00:19:27.456 --> 00:19:28.145\n&gt;&gt; More than three.\n\n405\n00:19:28.145 --> 00:19:31.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\nit's going through, okay, well,\n\n406\n00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:35.350\nI can see that you're doing ZIP\ncodes within the state of Florida.\n\n407\n00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:38.400\nSo let me go ahead and\nstart seeing other ZIP codes.\n\n408\n00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:42.530\nSo again that kind of it's thinking,\nit's got that information,\n\n409\n00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:44.410\nand that's what I've got here.\n\n410\n00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:49.650\nSo it took it a little bit of time\nto kinda finalize it's thought of,\n\n411\n00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:51.790\nhere's your ZIP codes in\nthe state of Florida.\n\n412\n00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:55.520\nEven though I only have the ones\nin Gainesville, so not that bad.\n\n413\n00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:59.726\nBut this is another example of\nwhere we went to the map area,\n\n414\n00:19:59.726 --> 00:20:03.200\nwhere we went from the U.S\nout to North America.\n\n415\n00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.310\nWe're gonna go backwards this time.\n\n416\n00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:09.840\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nright-click Format this Data Series here,\n\n417\n00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.950\ncome over here to our task pane.\n\n418\n00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:14.740\nAnd in the Map area,\ninstead of doing Automatic,\n\n419\n00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:18.741\nI'm gonna choose\nthe Only Regions with Data.\n\n420\n00:20:18.741 --> 00:20:23.920\nNow we're gonna go ahead and say,\nI don't want all the ZIP codes in Florida.\n\n421\n00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:26.850\nI only want the ones that\nare showing within the data that I'm\n\n422\n00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:28.120\npulling this chart from.\n\n423\n00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:32.753\nAnd then it will [SOUND],\nthat's Alachua County.\n\n424\n00:20:32.753 --> 00:20:34.655\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it looks like Alachua County.\n\n425\n00:20:34.655 --> 00:20:36.340\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that's where I had to verify-\n\n426\n00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:37.635\n&gt;&gt; The 5,000-foot view.\n\n427\n00:20:37.635 --> 00:20:39.605\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I had to verify, yep, no,\n\n428\n00:20:39.605 --> 00:20:41.852\nthose are the right shapes,\nokay, we're good.\n\n429\n00:20:41.852 --> 00:20:46.948\nBecause I mean, I didn't know that\nfrom just looking at the Excel chart.\n\n430\n00:20:46.948 --> 00:20:48.797\nBut I'm like,\nthat's exactly what I've got.\n\n431\n00:20:48.797 --> 00:20:52.400\nAnd so,\nnow you can see that the population\n\n432\n00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:56.954\nwith the largest amount\nof cats is in 32609.\n\n433\n00:20:56.954 --> 00:20:57.973\n&gt;&gt;

Wow.\n\n473\n00:22:49.102 --> 00:22:53.949\nBut, you can see that you can start\nformatting these different things if you\n\n474\n00:22:53.949 --> 00:22:56.524\nneeded to show like the boundaries of for\n\n475\n00:22:56.524 --> 00:23:00.483\nthis one the ZIP codes, or\nthe states or changing any of that.\n\n476\n00:23:00.483 --> 00:23:02.100\nYou can make them dashed lines.\n\n477\n00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.910\nNow we're starting to get into that whole,\nlike okay, more is less,\n\n478\n00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:06.500\nless is more type of thing.\n\n479\n00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:08.430\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, right.\n&gt;&gt; But you could go ahead and\n\n480\n00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:11.590\nchange those different\nthings if you wanted to.\n\n481\n00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:13.545\n&gt;&gt; Looks like something\nfrom Super Mario Kart.\n\n482\n00:23:13.545 --> 00:23:16.754\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I love that game.\n\n483\n00:23:16.754 --> 00:23:18.080\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Don't we all?\n\n484\n00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.250\n&gt;&gt; My gosh, yes.\n\n485\n00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:20.600\nThrow the mushroom.\n\n486\n00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:21.520\nSo we've got those, so\n\n487\n00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:24.790\nyou could see you could change all\nthe different pieces of the chart.\n\n488\n00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:30.520\nYou could also come in here and change the\nsize of the legend, so I can select this.\n\n489\n00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:35.480\nI could make the legend bold,\nI can make the font bigger if I wanted to.\n\n490\n00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:39.960\nI can come into the Chart and\nadd data labels, and\n\n491\n00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.356\nif I go into showing the data labels.\n\n492\n00:23:43.356 --> 00:23:49.635\nNow, some of these areas in these ZIP\ncodes might be a little small to show.\n\n493\n00:23:49.635 --> 00:23:53.431\nBut you can still come here, and\nif you select data labels and\n\n494\n00:23:53.431 --> 00:23:58.420\nit's selecting all of them, I can come\nover here and notice that in my task thing\n\n495\n00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:02.980\nI'm now formatting the data labels\nover here in the text options.\n\n496\n00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:07.706\nActually it's right here\nwith label options, sorry.\n\n497\n00:24:07.706 --> 00:24:12.339\nHere, so notice that I had to come over\nto some different parts of the label\n\n498\n00:24:12.339 --> 00:24:16.920\noptions I could turn on my series name or\nI could turn on my category name.\n\n499\n00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:23.230\nRemember, we're doing zip codes, and then\nI can also separate them by a new line.\n\n500\n00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:28.630\nSo if I'm trying to show, okay, in 32609,\nthere's 45,000, so on and so forth.\n\n501\n00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:32.809\nSo again, things that we've done in,\nI think, the Pi Chart episode and\n\n502\n00:24:32.809 --> 00:24:34.601\nI believe the Cluster Column.\n\n503\n00:24:34.601 --> 00:24:39.040\nBut it's the same stuff,\nit's just more in a geographical map\n\n504\n00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:42.820\nlike format instead of a pie or\na clustered column.\n\n505\n00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:45.700\nSo you've got some\ngeographical information.\n\n506\n00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:50.160\nYou can go ahead and chart it as long\nas you're an Office 365 subscriber, and\n\n507\n00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.740\nyou can do all that kinda fun stuff.\n\n508\n00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.980\nSo I love things like this.\n\n509\n00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:56.147\nI mean, it really is easy.\n\n510\n00:24:56.147 --> 00:24:57.720\nYou just go ahead and select it.\n\n511\n00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.179\nYou got to have a connection\nto the Internet and\n\n512\n00:25:00.179 --> 00:25:02.586\nlike I said the Office 365 subscription.\n\n513\n00:25:02.586 --> 00:25:07.045\nBut you see this stuff all over the place\nand now it's really cool that it is all\n\n514\n00:25:07.045 --> 00:25:10.980\nintegrated into Excel and\nit's bada-bing, bada-boom, done.\n\n515\n00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.540\n&gt;&gt; Awesome job as usual Vonne,\n\n516\n00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:15.460\nbut didn't you say something about\nshowing us how to consolidate?\n\n517\n00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:17.390\nI think you might have\nforgotten how to show us that.\n\n518\n00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:20.130\n&gt;&gt; My gosh, I'm so\nglad you mentioned that.\n\n519\n00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:23.115\nBecause yes, I was showing you that\nI actually didn't consolidate.\n\n520\n00:25:23.115 --> 00:25:24.810\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And I was gonna show you.\n\n521\n00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:27.690\nSee, that's why it's always\ngood to have my host.\n\n522\n00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:30.320\n&gt;&gt; That's why I'm around Vonne,\nI'm an old man.\n\n523\n00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:34.690\n&gt;&gt; Hey, I need, any of my hosts I say hey,\nif I say hey I'm gonna show you all and\n\n524\n00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:36.510\nthen I get to the episode\nI'm like hey I'm done.\n\n525\n00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:37.955\nAnd you're gonna be like no you're not.\n\n526\n00:25:37.955 --> 00:25:39.025\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n527\n00:25:39.025 --> 00:25:40.090\n&gt;&gt; So let me go ahead and\n\n528\n00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:42.974\nshow you that example as I\nsaid it did not consolidate,\n\n529\n00:25:42.974 --> 00:25:47.460\nyes cuz I didn't make that point\nMade a pretty big point on that one.\n\n530\n00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:49.620\nFor example, here.\n\n531\n00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:51.930\nI have some cities and some states.\n\n532\n00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:55.820\nAnd notice that I've got a couple\nthings like I have Florida\n\n533\n00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:56.670\nquite a few times in here.\n\n534\n00:25:56.670 --> 00:26:00.040\nAnd if we look at that,\nthat's a few of them.\n\n535\n00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.720\nWait, sorry, Jacksonville is first.\n\n536\n00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:04.115\nSo we have two, four, four, eight.\n\n537\n00:26:04.115 --> 00:26:05.130\nWe got a lot of them in there.\n\n538\n00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:10.680\nThis is where it does not\nconsolidate your information down.\n\n539\n00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:13.938\nLet's go ahead and\nselect all of this, all right?\n\n540\n00:26:13.938 --> 00:26:18.120\nAnd you can see we got a couple\nMassachusetts, a couple California.\n\n541\n00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.680\nLet's go ahead and insert our field chart.\n\n542\n00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.770\nAnd at first you're like,\nwell that's exactly what I like.\n\n543\n00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:28.750\nI got California and\nI've got Texas, and I'm all good.\n\n544\n00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:33.100\nIt's not until you go and add the data\nlabels in here, and if I show this,\n\n545\n00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:38.910\nit's saying that Florida only has two,\nand Texas only has four.\n\n546\n00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:42.920\nSo it is showing the field charts and\nthe colors\n\n547\n00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:47.650\nwithin like it thinks it's supposed to\ndo but what's true is not repeating.\n\n548\n00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:51.780\nNotice that it says,\nthe first instance of Florida is two.\n\n549\n00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:53.606\nThe first instance of California is one.\n\n550\n00:26:53.606 --> 00:26:56.304\nSo it's only pulling that first one and\n\n551\n00:26:56.304 --> 00:26:59.750\nit's not adding all that\ninformation together.\n\n552\n00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:04.592\nSo that's something I just wanted to point\nout is that you would need to do something\n\n553\n00:27:04.592 --> 00:27:07.031\nelse with your data here, consolidate?\n\n554\n00:27:07.031 --> 00:27:09.060\nYou could consolidate the data.\n\n555\n00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:12.350\nYou could go ahead and\ncreate a table, and then go ahead and\n\n556\n00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:13.710\ncopy and paste the values out of it.\n\n557\n00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:17.000\nI mean, there's a whole bunch of\nways that you could go ahead and\n\n558\n00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.110\nget it to where there is only one Florida.\n\n559\n00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:24.642\nThere's only one California, because\nthat's what this map is supposed to show.\n\n560\n00:27:24.642 --> 00:27:26.853\nIt's not gonna show the store in Tampa.\n\n561\n00:27:26.853 --> 00:27:31.602\nThat would be like maybe having a separate\nchart that shows within Florida,\n\n562\n00:27:31.602 --> 00:27:33.020\nthis is what you have.\n\n563\n00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:34.640\nAnd this is the map of all of them,\n\n564\n00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:39.850\nso just trying to give you those kind of\npointers that might lead you astray when\n\n565\n00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:43.380\nyou think your mapping out your\ninformation properly, but it's not.\n\n566\n00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:47.345\nSo just be careful of that, and then you\ncan just have multiple types of charts\n\n567\n00:27:47.345 --> 00:27:50.040\nwith the different information\nthat you wanna say.\n\n568\n00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:54.905\nSo now it is that simple and\nnow I'm done, for real.\n\n569\n00:27:54.905 --> 00:27:56.870\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Good job, Vonne.\n\n570\n00:27:56.870 --> 00:28:00.106\nBuild map charts,\neat a bowl of cereal, check out a lot.\n\n571\n00:28:00.106 --> 00:28:02.380\nYou know the more you do it\nthe easier it's gonna become.\n\n572\n00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:05.800\nSo Excel charts and pivot tables, there is\nmore in this series make sure you watch\n\n573\n00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:07.780\nevery single episode\nyou'll be glad you did.\n\n574\n00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:09.740\nAnd thank you for watching OfficeProTV,\n\n575\n00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:11.983\nremember a good office\npro is always learning.\n\n576\n00:28:11.983 --> 00:28:13.120\nI'm Zack Membis.\n\n577\n00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:13.832\n&gt;&gt;

I'm very excited to be here today.\n\n11\n00:00:37.016 --> 00:00:38.619\nReally I am,\nI'm always excited to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:39.370\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; She actually is,\n\n13\n00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.060\nshe's an excitable person, really anxious.\n\n14\n00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.327\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes, yes.\n\n15\n00:00:43.327 --> 00:00:44.495\n&gt;&gt; Loud noises.\n\n16\n00:00:44.495 --> 00:00:46.536\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\neveryone loves to scare me in this office.\n\n17\n00:00:46.536 --> 00:00:47.211\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's funny.\n\n18\n00:00:47.211 --> 00:00:49.865\n&gt;&gt; All they have to do is just come up\nbehind me like, hey, I'm like, aah!,\n\n19\n00:00:49.865 --> 00:00:50.470\nand I freak out.\n\n20\n00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.712\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I wanna get one of those\nair horns, sneak up behind you,\n\n21\n00:00:52.712 --> 00:00:53.576\nit could be funny.\n\n22\n00:00:53.576 --> 00:00:54.981\n&gt;&gt; That might, we might have an accident.\n\n23\n00:00:54.981 --> 00:00:56.589\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n24\n00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:57.453\n&gt;&gt; That would be bad.\n\n25\n00:00:57.453 --> 00:00:58.638\n&gt;&gt; And what's Daniel running\naround with scissors in this.\n\n26\n00:00:58.638 --> 00:01:00.875\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're hardened Von,\n\n27\n00:01:00.875 --> 00:01:02.200\nyou know how it goes.\n\n28\n00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah don't go near so, but I'm excited\nto talk about pivot tables today.\n\n29\n00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.750\nI mean pivot tables is probably one of\nthe things that everybody wants to do and\n\n30\n00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.390\nare scared about it and\nhave no idea what they can do for you.\n\n31\n00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.350\nAnd it's one of things that if\nyou kinda just break it down,\n\n32\n00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.630\nwe're gonna do a very basic one,\nwe're gonna start.\n\n33\n00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.430\nBaby steps,\nkind of get our feet underneath us, and\n\n34\n00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.750\nonce you understand, like,\nthe mechanics of how a pivot table works,\n\n35\n00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.020\nhopefully by the end of this episode,\nyou'll be like, it's that easy?\n\n36\n00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.735\nI'm going to go run out and make some\npivot tables, so it's really fun.\n\n37\n00:01:35.735 --> 00:01:37.040\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't even have any data\n\n38\n00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.540\nthat will work in pivot tables,\nI'm gonna make some.\n\n39\n00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.480\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, you know,\n\n40\n00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.770\nthat's a perfect point right there.\n\n41\n00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:49.215\nYou do have to have data that is well,\npivot table-able.\n\n42\n00:01:49.215 --> 00:01:49.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n43\n00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:56.240\nIf you just have first name, last name and\nzipcodes you can't really do much in that.\n\n44\n00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Von and I had an interesting\nconversation about this.\n\n45\n00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.920\nI was like, how come we can't\njust make a chart to this?\n\n46\n00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.870\nShe's like, It sounds like what you're\ntalking about is a pivot table.\n\n47\n00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.020\nI'm like, okay, that sounds good.\n\n48\n00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.370\n&gt;&gt; And it was funny because in that\nlittle debate we had we had to\n\n49\n00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.150\ntake a couple laps around the track.\n\n50\n00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.635\n&gt;&gt; We had to turn the grinder.\n\n51\n00:02:14.635 --> 00:02:15.460\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then I'm like,\n\n52\n00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.350\nthat's what you're asking about.\n\n53\n00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.350\nI think this is what you want.\n\n54\n00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.900\nSo I'm very curious to see if this\nis going to tickle your fancy,\n\n55\n00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.170\nlike that's what I was talking about.\n\n56\n00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.050\nBut in that whole conversation, it did\ncome back to the point where we were like,\n\n57\n00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.380\nyeah, you could chart anything.\n\n58\n00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.800\nYou could make anything into a chart.\n\n59\n00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.870\nIt won't mean anything.\n\n60\n00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:35.780\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't make any sense.\n\n61\n00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:36.550\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so\n\n62\n00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.570\nyou it's like you could go ahead and\ncreate a pivot table and\n\n63\n00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.956\nstart dragging things all over the place,\nbut it could be like\n\n64\n00:02:40.956 --> 00:02:42.281\n&gt;&gt; It means nothing.\n\n65\n00:02:42.281 --> 00:02:45.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it's one of those things were you\n\n66\n00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.540\nhave to kinda know your data,\nthat's firs at all.\n\n67\n00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.040\nAnd what do you want from it,\nwhat kind of questions are you asking it,\n\n68\n00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.490\nand what type of report\nare you wanting from it,\n\n69\n00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.590\nand is it even possible for\nthe data to say that to you.\n\n70\n00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.180\n&gt;&gt; Right, cuz it's gonna I'll be based on\n&gt;&gt; Those questions that you're asking and\n\n71\n00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.600\nwhat you're desiring to get out of\nit is going to lead you to, I should\n\n72\n00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.170\nbe using a pivot table that's what\nthis does or just a regular old chart,\n\n73\n00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.880\nthat's what this does, and\nthem putting it together that way.\n\n74\n00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.730\nThat's where I was losing the disconnect.\n\n75\n00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and we even did that whole\nlike it's almost like asking google.\n\n76\n00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.120\nBut you don't even know\nhow to ask the question.\n\n77\n00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.870\nIt gives you answers and it's like\nno that's not what I'm asking you.\n\n78\n00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.133\nIt's like trying to find those\nspecific words to where it kind of\n\n79\n00:03:29.133 --> 00:03:31.680\nthat's what you mean.\n\n80\n00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.670\nSo, it's part of learning.\n\n81\n00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.270\nIts part of just being\nable to sit there and\n\n82\n00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.460\nevaluate what tool I need to be\nable to have the result I want.\n\n83\n00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.120\nAnd that's hard.\n\n84\n00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.100\nI still struggle with it.\n\n85\n00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.490\nI mean we all struggle with it every day.\n\n86\n00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.719\nNo matter how much you use a product,\nthere's always some New little twirl,\n\n87\n00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:54.104\nlike yeah, if I did that,\nthat, that, yeah.\n\n88\n00:03:54.104 --> 00:03:55.940\n[LAUGH] So it's a process.\n\n89\n00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:56.880\n&gt;&gt; It is that.\n\n90\n00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.270\n&gt;&gt; I am going to consult my notes for\njust a second, because well,\n\n91\n00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:00.240\nwhat is a pivot table?\n\n92\n00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.350\nWe should probably go ahead and\nanswer that question.\n\n93\n00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.200\nAnd this is in the show notes, and\nI do have a link to the Wikipedia article,\n\n94\n00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.290\nbecause it's always good to\nhave some base mods there.\n\n95\n00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.580\nSo the whole idea here is that\nit is a data summarization tool.\n\n96\n00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.280\nSo you're gonna be generating\na report from your data like we've\n\n97\n00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.880\nbeen talking about.\n\n98\n00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.790\nNow the cool thing is\nthat you're not gonna be\n\n99\n00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.020\nmessing with your data In\na sense you're not modifying it.\n\n100\n00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.180\nYou don't even have to do any sorts or\nfilters or anything.\n\n101\n00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.190\nYou're going to use this pivot table\nto summarize your information.\n\n102\n00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.730\nAnd this is a direct quote.\n\n103\n00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.080\nIt says, the user sets up and changes\nthe summary structure by dragging and\n\n104\n00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.760\ndropping fields graphically.\n\n105\n00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.905\nYeah, you're just basically taking this\nand this, and you're putting it into this\n\n106\n00:04:42.905 --> 00:04:47.650\ntabular-like format and it just goes\nahead and summarizes your information.\n\n107\n00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:53.430\nThis rotation, or pivoting of the summary\ntable gives the concept of its name.\n\n108\n00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.720\nYou're going to be able to pivot around.\n\n109\n00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.810\nLet's go ahead and take this.\n\n110\n00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.200\nData, turn it on it side and\nso on and so forth.\n\n111\n00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.470\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and make this.\n\n112\n00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.680\nIt still works with columns and rows, and\n\n113\n00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.090\nthen it goes ahead and\ncalculates something.\n\n114\n00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.680\nBut it's all kinda integrated\nwithin this particular piece.\n\n115\n00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.740\nAnd I did find something interesting in as\nit says the term pivot table is a generic\n\n116\n00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.810\nphrase used by multiple vendors.\n\n117\n00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:21.270\nBut Microsoft corporation has\ntrademarked the specific compound word\n\n118\n00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.290\nform of habittable no space.\n\n119\n00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.550\nSo I that that was very interesting.\n\n120\n00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.280\nYeah so that is a trademark term now if\n\n121\n00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.980\nyou can see on our episode title\nI did put the space in there but\n\n122\n00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.820\nwe are using Pivot tables without the\nspace because we're in Microsoft Excel.\n\n123\n00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.350\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; It boggles my mind that you can like\n\n124\n00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.617\ntrademark words.\n\n125\n00:05:41.617 --> 00:05:43.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n126\n00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.640\n&gt;&gt; That you didn't make up, right?\n\n127\n00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.060\nI guess that's how they're\ngetting around it,\n\n128\n00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.655\nlike pivot Pivot tables is not necessarily\na proper word, as a compound word so they\n\n129\n00:05:50.655 --> 00:05:54.963\ncan I made that up and trademark it but-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and it is a capital T.\n\n130\n00:05:54.963 --> 00:05:55.595\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n131\n00:05:55.595 --> 00:05:57.785\n&gt;&gt; For the table so that is-\n&gt;&gt; Capital T, capital T.\n\n132\n00:05:57.785 --> 00:05:59.755\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nAnd it is one word.\n\n133\n00:05:59.755 --> 00:06:04.055\nSo I just wanted to throw that\nout there to kinda clarify\n\n134\n00:06:04.055 --> 00:06:08.140\npivot tables are not\nspecifically only for.\n\n135\n00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:15.330\nExcel, other programs can do pivot tables,\nor just the concept of a pivot table.\n\n136\n00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:20.350\n&gt;&gt; They do the same thing with\ntheir database server, SQL.\n\n137\n00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.550\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; So SQL is the language,\n\n138\n00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:23.920\nit's TSQL properly.\n\n139\n00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:29.380\nBut SQL is the type of database But\nthey call it Sequel, SQL, Sequel, right.\n\n140\n00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.870\nBut you, there is no other database\nthat uses SQL that's called SQLl,\n\n141\n00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.130\nonly Microsoft, that's a trademark\nname of a Microsoft database.\n\n142\n00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:37.690\nThey're crafty people over there.\n\n143\n00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:38.826\n&gt;&gt; They do that a lot.\n\n144\n00:06:38.826 --> 00:06:39.569\n&gt;&gt; Yeah they do.\n\n145\n00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:42.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\njust throwing that out there.\n\n146\n00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:47.160\nWe are going to be using this\ngeneric type of pivot table but\n\n147\n00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.790\nspecifically in Microsoft it is pivot\ntable no space but I didn't wanna get too\n\n148\n00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:55.414\ncrazy with the no space and the capital-\n&gt;&gt; It's a good clarification of that\n\n149\n00:06:55.414 --> 00:06:58.578\nbecause if you're not working\nin Excel there are other\n\n150\n00:06:58.578 --> 00:07:01.741\ntypes of spreadsheet programs\nthat will do, almost,\n\n151\n00:07:01.741 --> 00:07:06.080\nif not identically the exact same\nthing and use the term pivot table.\n\n152\n00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.460\nthey just won't do it the way Microsoft\ndoes because that's trademarked.\n\n153\n00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:10.280\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n154\n00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.670\nWhy don't we jump into a file and\n\n155\n00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:15.310\nstart getting our feet wet\nwith creating pivot tables.\n\n156\n00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:19.180\nI kept this data source pretty short.\n\n157\n00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.560\nI kind of extended it out.\n\n158\n00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:25.100\nWe've seen these in our addresses for\nChristmas Cats Incorporated.\n\n159\n00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.270\nWe've seen Mocha Cup and\nPumpkin Squash and everything but\n\n160\n00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:32.930\nI wanted to kind of tied into\nsome business-like aspect and\n\n161\n00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:37.760\nalso be able to get it into something\nthat I could use a pivot table for.\n\n162\n00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.565\nBecause if I just had a list of addresses\nand names, I could count it but\n\n163\n00:07:41.565 --> 00:07:44.596\nthen I could just use a count\nfunction on that anyway, so\n\n164\n00:07:44.596 --> 00:07:47.194\nit's not that There's\nnothing special here.\n\n165\n00:07:47.194 --> 00:07:52.093\nSo, just to kind of get a familiarity with\nthis particular data, we have over here,\n\n166\n00:07:52.093 --> 00:07:55.960\nthese first couple of columns\nare really just like customers.\n\n167\n00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.139\nOkay?\nSo the customer is Mocha,\n\n168\n00:07:58.139 --> 00:08:02.777\nthe customer is Tootsie And\nthen over on these columns,\n\n169\n00:08:02.777 --> 00:08:08.498\nthis is where, who was the sales rep\nthat they talked to at the store or\n\n170\n00:08:08.498 --> 00:08:12.562\nonline, and\nwhat category of item did they buy?\n\n171\n00:08:12.562 --> 00:08:14.840\nLooks like Mocha bought some toys.\n\n172\n00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.046\nWhat was the unit price of that\nparticular toy or category.\n\n173\n00:08:19.046 --> 00:08:22.330\nSo that's where you can do one step\nfurther, what's the actual item.\n\n174\n00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:26.010\nSo you can think about like an itemized\nlist of your sales and so on and so forth.\n\n175\n00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:28.940\nWhat was the quantity,\nand what was the total?\n\n176\n00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.000\nThis is a small formula right here.\n\n177\n00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.582\nI've just taken the quantity times unit\nprice, then you get the total sale for\n\n178\n00:08:35.582 --> 00:08:39.417\nthat particular item, or\nthis particular category right here.\n\n179\n00:08:39.417 --> 00:08:41.728\nSo I only have about 26 rows, but\n\n180\n00:08:41.728 --> 00:08:47.243\nif you had daily inventory that could\nbe 26,000, that could be 2 million.\n\n181\n00:08:47.243 --> 00:08:51.350\nI mean maybe not 2 million, because we\nonly have 1 million rows in a cell.\n\n182\n00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:53.130\nYou know what I'm trying to say [LAUGH].\n\n183\n00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:55.039\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Large chunks of data.\n\n184\n00:08:55.039 --> 00:08:55.869\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n185\n00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:57.780\n&gt;&gt; That you need to report,\n\n186\n00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.603\nget information from.\n\n187\n00:08:59.603 --> 00:09:02.373\nAnd that's not something that's\nreally easily sortable, and\n\n188\n00:09:02.373 --> 00:09:03.710\nmaybe you can't even sort it.\n\n189\n00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.930\nOkay, so\njust kind of throwing that out there.\n\n190\n00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:10.262\nNow what we're going to do is we're\ngonna say things like, all right,\n\n191\n00:09:10.262 --> 00:09:17.580\nI wanna see how many,\nwhat's the total sales for each sales rep?\n\n192\n00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:21.070\nNow that's something we could\neasily do with a table.\n\n193\n00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:24.590\nSo these are trying to go through\nthe thought process of like, all right,\n\n194\n00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:28.020\nwell let's go ahead and format this as\na table, cuz you know I love tables.\n\n195\n00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:29.980\nThey are one of my favorite things.\n\n196\n00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:33.220\nSo we've got here,\nwe could go into our total row and\n\n197\n00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:36.542\nthen right over here,\nwell there's my total sales.\n\n198\n00:09:36.542 --> 00:09:37.394\nSorry, it's behind my head here.\n\n199\n00:09:37.394 --> 00:09:39.050\nYou know what, let me just move over.\n\n200\n00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.775\nThere we go, cuz you guys wanna\nhear me talk a little bit more so.\n\n201\n00:09:41.775 --> 00:09:43.962\n[LAUGH] So I moved it over here so\nwe got that.\n\n202\n00:09:43.962 --> 00:09:48.110\nSo we have our, about $1,600 in sales.\n\n203\n00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:50.540\nNow in the table,\nI could go ahead and say, well,\n\n204\n00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:54.890\nlet's go ahead and uncheck all of my\nsales rep, and let's see how Daniel did.\n\n205\n00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:55.579\nI put you in as a salesperson.\n\n206\n00:09:55.579 --> 00:09:57.330\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully I did well.\n\n207\n00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.134\n&gt;&gt; You sold almost $600.\n\n208\n00:09:59.134 --> 00:09:59.785\n&gt;&gt; Well good for me.\n\n209\n00:09:59.785 --> 00:10:00.670\n&gt;&gt; Okay, right?\n\n210\n00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:01.838\n[LAUGH] And then I can say,\n\n211\n00:10:01.838 --> 00:10:04.424\nwell then how much-\n&gt;&gt; What’s my commission on that?\n\n212\n00:10:04.424 --> 00:10:05.495\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt;

You just took the questions\nright our of my brain.\n\n242\n00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:41.678\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n243\n00:11:41.678 --> 00:11:43.212\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; I was thinking do we have to have\n\n244\n00:11:43.212 --> 00:11:46.680\ncontiguous data, or does it work like\nwe did with non-contiguous charts?\n\n245\n00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.120\nAm I able to repeat that kind of process?\n\n246\n00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it needs to all be related, and\nit does need to be next to each other.\n\n247\n00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.550\nAnd the other thing is,\nyou wanna avoid blank rows.\n\n248\n00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:58.230\nYou don't wanna have blank dead or\nblank spots in there.\n\n249\n00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:00.910\n&gt;&gt; So if it's zero put zero and\nnot just leave it blank?\n\n250\n00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:01.680\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n251\n00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.580\n&gt;&gt; That's one of the other\nthings that I've seen on\n\n252\n00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:08.440\ntutorials when I was learning how\nto do this, and also just reuping.\n\n253\n00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.190\nYeah, I remember you need to make sure\nyou don't have that kind of stuff.\n\n254\n00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:13.250\nSo just keep those things in mind.\n\n255\n00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:15.580\nSo this is a nice\ncontiguous range of data.\n\n256\n00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:16.530\nI have my mouse.\n\n257\n00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:18.800\nIt does not need to be\nformatted as a table first.\n\n258\n00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.080\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n259\n00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.570\n&gt;&gt; I was just doing that for us.\n\n260\n00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:25.760\nLets go over here to insert, and\nwe will go over here to pivot table.\n\n261\n00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:26.660\nWe click on this,\n\n262\n00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:30.290\nand you can see easily arrange and\nsummarize complex data into a pivot table.\n\n263\n00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:33.530\nWe single click on this, and see it's\nautomatically going to be grabbing.\n\n264\n00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:35.540\nNow it does say table 1,\n\n265\n00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:39.670\nbecause that was just when I formatted\nit as a table it just sees it.\n\n266\n00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:44.140\nYou're probably gonna see a range of\ncells like A1 through whatever, so\n\n267\n00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:47.180\nyou might see it in\na different context here.\n\n268\n00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:49.890\nBut it is finding this whole area.\n\n269\n00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:51.400\nWhere do I wanna put this?\n\n270\n00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:55.670\nI'm gonna put it in the existing\nworksheet so we can see it side by side,\n\n271\n00:12:55.670 --> 00:13:00.120\nrather than putting it into a new\nworksheet But it would be by itself.\n\n272\n00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.400\nYour data's over here, here's your report,\nso we're good with that.\n\n273\n00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.000\nI'm gonna click on existing.\n\n274\n00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.570\nAnd then what I'm gonna do\nhere is I'm gonna put my\n\n275\n00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:12.140\ncursor where it says Location,\ncuz I want to then move out over here.\n\n276\n00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:16.964\nLet's move up a little bit, so\nI'm gonna put this right here, so\n\n277\n00:13:16.964 --> 00:13:18.739\nright next to our data.\n\n278\n00:13:18.739 --> 00:13:21.522\nBut make sure you put your\ncursor in there first, so\n\n279\n00:13:21.522 --> 00:13:26.060\nit knows that's where it's gonna insert\nthe new pivot table that I want.\n\n280\n00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:30.230\nYou click OK, and it creates this.\n\n281\n00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:33.650\nNow, it puts in this right hand\n\n282\n00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:37.500\ntask pane that talks about\nthe different pivot tables.\n\n283\n00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.694\nAnd then it puts this little\nchart looking thingy,\n\n284\n00:13:40.694 --> 00:13:44.347\n[LAUGH] over here on the right,\nor where I've told it to go.\n\n285\n00:13:44.347 --> 00:13:48.840\nAll right, so now it knows it's pulling\nthis data, and this is our task pane.\n\n286\n00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.240\nSo now you have to think,\nwhat do I want from this?\n\n287\n00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.670\nThis is pulling all the fields.\n\n288\n00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:54.390\nYou do need to have headers,\nthat's another thing.\n\n289\n00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:58.770\nIf you don't have header information,\na header row to classify what\n\n290\n00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:03.300\nthat particular field is, and we are going\nto be referring to these as fields.\n\n291\n00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.690\nThis is more like a database term as well,\nwe are not just saying a column.\n\n292\n00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:11.868\nIt is still a column, but they\nare using that terminology of a field.\n\n293\n00:14:11.868 --> 00:14:14.097\nSo you can see that all of our\nfields are listed here, and\n\n294\n00:14:14.097 --> 00:14:17.615\nthat's why I was saying the whole\nheader thing, you gotta have those.\n\n295\n00:14:17.615 --> 00:14:18.575\nFirst, last name, duh, duh, duh.\n\n296\n00:14:18.575 --> 00:14:21.630\nAll right, so now I've got that,\nI can see everything.\n\n297\n00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:26.520\nBut underneath this, this is where\nyou have all of your matrix squares.\n\n298\n00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:29.217\nYou have a filter,\ncolumns, rows, and values.\n\n299\n00:14:29.217 --> 00:14:32.820\nAll right, I want to see,\nwe said sales reps right?\n\n300\n00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:36.170\nSales reps and let's do a quantity.\n\n301\n00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:39.240\nHow many units did they sell?\n\n302\n00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.770\nSo, its really just drag and drop.\n\n303\n00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:43.100\nThat's all you gotta do.\n\n304\n00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:47.440\nYou take your sales rep here, and\nyou see how you get a four pointed arrow?\n\n305\n00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.751\nI just put my fingers up with two.\n\n306\n00:14:48.751 --> 00:14:49.695\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH] So you have here,\n\n338\n00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:23.100\nonce I'm back in the pivot table,\nthe task pane comes back up.\n\n339\n00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:27.000\nAnd you can see that it acts\nvery much like a table.\n\n340\n00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.920\nCuz, well, it is, it's a pivot table.\n\n341\n00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:29.630\n&gt;&gt; It's a table, yeah.\n\n342\n00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.690\n&gt;&gt; So now let's go one step further.\n\n343\n00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:35.090\nWe have our sales reps in our rows.\n\n344\n00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:37.461\nBut I'd like to see a breakdown.\n\n345\n00:16:37.461 --> 00:16:38.830\nI'm getting all the quantities.\n\n346\n00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:41.440\nI wanna see a breakdown of, well,\n\n347\n00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:46.080\nwhat categories are their\nquantities coming from?\n\n348\n00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.550\nAnd this is where you start getting\ninto your matrix-like thing.\n\n349\n00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:49.750\nThis is pretty cool.\n\n350\n00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:50.830\nWe go with Category here.\n\n351\n00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:52.780\nSo we're gonna go over on the right.\n\n352\n00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:53.680\nWe're gonna grab this.\n\n353\n00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.070\nWe're gonna drag it down.\n\n354\n00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:59.106\nAnd what we're gonna do is we're gonna\nput this down into the category.\n\n355\n00:16:59.106 --> 00:17:01.540\nWe're gonna put this into the columns.\n\n356\n00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.290\nNow watch what happens.\n\n357\n00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:05.780\nLook at that, it just totally did-\n&gt;&gt; That's cool!\n\n358\n00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:08.085\n&gt;&gt; Right, it totally did a matrix.\n\n359\n00:17:08.085 --> 00:17:11.090\nAll right, well, I could say, well, Alice,\n\n360\n00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:14.190\nhow many total units did\nshe sell in clothing?\n\n361\n00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:15.310\nIt's right there, it's 17.\n\n362\n00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:17.454\nAnd then her grand total is 60.\n\n363\n00:17:17.454 --> 00:17:21.462\nSo it's breaking down by\nsales representatives,\n\n364\n00:17:21.462 --> 00:17:26.360\nby accessories, and\nthen giving me all of the totals.\n\n365\n00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:29.000\nAnd that's where it's talking\nabout the whole just dragging.\n\n366\n00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.758\nWe're graphically dragging\nfields into this matrix.\n\n367\n00:17:33.758 --> 00:17:36.610\nAnd it's doing all of the reporting for\nus.\n\n368\n00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:38.590\n&gt;&gt; So it's like a dynamic table.\n\n369\n00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:41.460\nYou take all this data that you\nhave inside of your worksheet.\n\n370\n00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:44.170\nYou say, I just wanna quickly\nmake a table out of that.\n\n371\n00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:44.780\nBing, bing, bing.\n\n372\n00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:47.084\nIt has to obviously make\nsense within that context.\n\n373\n00:17:47.084 --> 00:17:49.710\nBut just start grabbing it,\nslap it in there.\n\n374\n00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:52.620\nPut it in the right order,\nand voila, you have a table.\n\n375\n00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.600\nYou don't have to go through the manual\nwork of, well, I want this and\n\n376\n00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.890\nI want that and fill in the.\n\n377\n00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:58.760\nSo much easier.\n\n378\n00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:00.418\n&gt;&gt; It's a data summary tool.\n\n379\n00:18:00.418 --> 00:18:02.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, super awesome.\n&gt;&gt; It just goes ahead and summarizes it.\n\n380\n00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.320\nAnd this is where it gets,\nI think, even cooler.\n\n381\n00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:07.300\nIt's like,\nthat's pretty neat of the matrix.\n\n382\n00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:09.130\nWell, let's do a few more examples.\n\n383\n00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.850\nLet's keep on with this.\n\n384\n00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:13.880\nNow, I went ahead and I wanted to show\nyou the matrix of the rows and columns.\n\n385\n00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.960\nBut you could just start\nmoving these things around.\n\n386\n00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:19.094\nHere, let's come back over to\nthe fields behind my head.\n\n387\n00:18:19.094 --> 00:18:21.230\nI wanna do, all right,\nSales Rep and Category.\n\n388\n00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:23.130\nYou can just take this Category and watch.\n\n389\n00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:26.320\nIf I just put it in with another row, and\nnow I have a whole another [INAUDIBLE].\n\n390\n00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.410\n&gt;&gt;

That’s cool.\n\n552\n00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:28.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n553\n00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.390\nAnd I didn't even show you,\n\n554\n00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:33.210\nall I've been doing is doing the reporting\npart, but you have drop-downs here.\n\n555\n00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:36.180\nSo it's the same filterings\nthat you would want to do.\n\n556\n00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:40.210\nYou have it just like you have as\na regular table, now it's a pivot table.\n\n557\n00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:42.704\nBut you can just say let me turn on and\noff certain things.\n\n558\n00:25:42.704 --> 00:25:45.140\nLet me turn on and off certain sales reps.\n\n559\n00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:47.300\nAll right, that's pretty neat.\n\n560\n00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.860\nI could go ahead and repeat the labels.\n\n561\n00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:52.410\nI'm not sure if I really need\nto see Alice, Alice, Alice.\n\n562\n00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:53.480\nThat's okay.\n\n563\n00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.440\nWe'll just go ahead and\nnot repeat the labels.\n\n564\n00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.640\n&gt;&gt; Could you then chart this table?\n\n565\n00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.430\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you can.\n&gt;&gt; That would be awesome.\n\n566\n00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:01.800\n&gt;&gt; That's what it-\n&gt;&gt; Just bringing it all full circle.\n\n567\n00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.280\n&gt;&gt; That's what a pivot chart is.\n\n568\n00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:03.985\n&gt;&gt; My goodness.\n\n569\n00:26:03.985 --> 00:26:06.260\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n570\n00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:09.230\nSo we just go ahead and staying on here,\n\n571\n00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:12.100\nif we go where you can\nturn off the grand totals.\n\n572\n00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:13.740\nYou can turn them on.\n\n573\n00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:16.760\nDo you want to even show subtotals?\n\n574\n00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:19.440\nI can turn those off so\nI just get a grand report.\n\n575\n00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:23.540\nSo it's nice that you have all of\nthese on and off types of features.\n\n576\n00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:26.730\nAnd do you want to have your\nsubtotals on the bottom or the top?\n\n577\n00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:28.360\nYou can go with either way.\n\n578\n00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:28.952\nSo you can go through.\n\n579\n00:26:28.952 --> 00:26:32.540\nAnd then the style, we've been talking\nabout styles through everything.\n\n580\n00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:35.660\nI wanna make this just\nlook a little more jazzy.\n\n581\n00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:36.970\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; We can go ahead and\n\n582\n00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:37.900\nthrow that on there.\n\n583\n00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:40.185\n&gt;&gt; Put the capital G,\ngussy on that sucker, right?\n\n584\n00:26:40.185 --> 00:26:43.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, gussy that baby up.\n\n585\n00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:43.625\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n586\n00:26:43.625 --> 00:26:45.620\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you have the same check\n\n587\n00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:48.040\nboxes of like the banded rows or columns.\n\n588\n00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:53.730\nSo you can go through here and format\nthe look of this report however you want.\n\n589\n00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:56.480\nAnd then maybe I wanna throw\nthat matrix over here and\n\n590\n00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:59.560\nput it into a different\nway of looking at things.\n\n591\n00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:02.430\nChanging my report layout\nback into compact.\n\n592\n00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:07.000\nI don't need to see all of these\naccessories, let's just look at clothing.\n\n593\n00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.116\nI mean, it just goes on and\non of how much fun really you can have,\n\n594\n00:27:11.116 --> 00:27:14.016\nand that the whole pivoting\nof a pivot table by\n\n595\n00:27:14.016 --> 00:27:18.318\njust dragging these different fields\ninto where you need it to go.\n\n596\n00:27:18.318 --> 00:27:20.390\nAnd you can also do more summing.\n\n597\n00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:22.020\nSo let me just take this.\n\n598\n00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:27.030\nIf I take this category, if I wanted\nto then also calculate the unit price,\n\n599\n00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:30.040\nyou can have more than one value in here.\n\n600\n00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:34.440\nSo notice that now it's like I can see\nthe percentages cuz that's what we did\n\n601\n00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:35.633\nthe totals.\n\n602\n00:27:35.633 --> 00:27:38.794\nAnd let's go back over here and\nnot do the percentages.\n\n603\n00:27:38.794 --> 00:27:40.720\nLet's just do no calculation.\n\n604\n00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:41.781\nSo now you just see the sales.\n\n605\n00:27:41.781 --> 00:27:44.180\nBut then I also have the unit prices.\n\n606\n00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:47.290\nSo you can have multiple\nitems in the values.\n\n607\n00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:50.046\nYou can have multiple items in the row.\n\n608\n00:27:50.046 --> 00:27:53.570\nIt's just how, cuz then I could break\nit down to city again, all right?\n\n609\n00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:57.950\nSo now I can see which city sold the most\nitems of those different unit price.\n\n610\n00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:01.160\nI mean, it just goes on and on and\non of how you can go ahead and report it.\n\n611\n00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:05.440\nBut again, you have to know\nwhat you're trying to ask it.\n\n612\n00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:09.560\nSo that's where we need to\njust keep our brain intact and\n\n613\n00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.650\nknow what our data needs to say.\n\n614\n00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:17.130\nSo last thing I wanna end on is just\nhow do I get rid of this, right?\n\n615\n00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:18.720\nOkay like I-\n&gt;&gt; I'm sick of this table.\n\n616\n00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and-\n&gt;&gt; Be gone.\n\n617\n00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:23.014\n&gt;&gt; Be gone, yeah.\nAnd that's almost a little, it's a little,\n\n618\n00:28:23.014 --> 00:28:25.689\nit's almost too easy, but then it's weird.\n\n619\n00:28:25.689 --> 00:28:26.870\nI'll show you what I'm talking about.\n\n620\n00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:30.380\nWe need to, first of all,\ncome over here to analyze.\n\n621\n00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:33.840\nAnd then we can go over to our Select.\n\n622\n00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:37.150\nAnd when I Select,\nI want the whole pivot table.\n\n623\n00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:41.270\nSo I come in the whole pivot table,\nand now I want to get rid of it.\n\n624\n00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:44.700\nSo if I say I can clear all and\neverything goes away.\n\n625\n00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:46.250\nBut the pivot table still stays there.\n\n626\n00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:49.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthere's still like a a placeholder for it.\n\n627\n00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:51.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's saying I'm ready for you to\ngo ahead and drag the fields around and\n\n628\n00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:52.780\nstart pivoting again.\n\n629\n00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:54.502\nIt's like no,\nI want you to go away [LAUGH].\n\n630\n00:28:54.502 --> 00:28:57.426\nSo I want a clear button or delete table,\n\n631\n00:28:57.426 --> 00:29:01.260\nyou just hit the Delete\nbutton on the keyboard.\n\n632\n00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:04.480\nSo if you just delete it sorry,\nokay well let's try that again.\n\n633\n00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:07.190\nLet's go ahead and\nthen this is the one I always do.\n\n634\n00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:08.950\nI clear it and\nI think it's still selected.\n\n635\n00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:12.810\nYou gotta come back and\nselect the pivot table again, sorry.\n\n636\n00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:15.720\nNow you just hit the Delete key and\nI'm okay, now it's gone.\n\n637\n00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.250\nBut then wait, what's this?\n\n638\n00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:18.210\n&gt;&gt; Some crazy box.\n\n639\n00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:20.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and then I'm looking for borders,\n\n640\n00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:24.760\nand that whole I'm trying to make\nsomething more complicated than it was.\n\n641\n00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:29.000\nWait, so I could have just kept\nthat whole thing selected.\n\n642\n00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.186\nThe whole Clear All back on the Home tab.\n\n643\n00:29:31.186 --> 00:29:31.718\nThere you go.\n\n644\n00:29:31.718 --> 00:29:32.430\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n645\n00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:37.730\n&gt;&gt; I think because it is a special\nentity as a pivot table, it didn't\n\n646\n00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:41.440\nshow the grid lines just for that one part\nbecause there were still cells in there.\n\n647\n00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was weird.\n\n648\n00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:45.190\n&gt;&gt; But you couldn't go back to\nthe borders or view grid lines.\n\n649\n00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:45.940\nIt's kind of strange like that.\n\n650\n00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:48.650\n&gt;&gt; It had done so many things in the\nbackground that you were kind of clearing\n\n651\n00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:52.200\nindividual things instead of everything\nwhich the Clear All button took care of.\n\n652\n00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:54.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\nSo I had to select the entire pivot table.\n\n653\n00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:55.260\nHad to clear it.\n\n654\n00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:58.290\nGo back, select the entire pivot\ntable again, hit the Delete key.\n\n655\n00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:00.830\nAnd then come over with those\nselected cells to the Home tab and\n\n656\n00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:02.060\nhit the Clear All button.\n\n657\n00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:06.540\nSo again, kind of convoluted\nto get it all the way gone.\n\n658\n00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:09.280\nBut I just wanted to show you cuz that\nwas one that always threw me off.\n\n659\n00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So I wanted to show you.\n\n660\n00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:13.430\nSo again, just basics of pivot tables.\n\n661\n00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:18.080\nPivot tables can go pretty high up and\nhow you're gonna be reporting your data.\n\n662\n00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.920\nAnd you can import it from other places,\nI mean, you can get a little crazy.\n\n663\n00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:25.795\nAnd like you said, the chart, well, a\nchart's just charting that information, so\n\n664\n00:30:25.795 --> 00:30:28.825\nyou just go and\nsay make a chart out of this and\n\n665\n00:30:28.825 --> 00:30:32.170\nit does the same thing as being able to-\n&gt;&gt; Does it make that noise?\n\n666\n00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:33.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [NOISE] just like that, so.\n\n667\n00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:34.709\n&gt;&gt; Trademark that before\nMicrosoft grabs it.\n\n668\n00:30:34.709 --> 00:30:39.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, so that's our basic\npivot tables, and I feel we're gonna\n\n669\n00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:44.240\nbe making some other episodes of just\ngiving you more examples, different ways\n\n670\n00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:48.650\nto do things and taking it maybe just\nanother level up from the basics.\n\n671\n00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:49.570\n&gt;&gt; Well Vonne, I appreciate\n\n672\n00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:51.300\nthat you didn't chuck us into\nthe deep end of the pool.\n\n673\n00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:55.900\nI've still got my floaties on, so I'm\nnot ready for that deep water quite yet.\n\n674\n00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:59.480\nBut we were able to get our feet\nwet inside of pivot tables.\n\n675\n00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:00.320\nThey're very simple.\n\n676\n00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.640\nVery easy, and very cool to play with.\n\n677\n00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:03.620\nIt wasn't too difficult.\n\n678\n00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:07.100\nI don't think it was beyond anybody's\nhere scope of understanding, so\n\n679\n00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:08.300\nget in there and play with them.\n\n680\n00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:09.330\nManipulate that data.\n\n681\n00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:14.150\nMake those pivot tables do something\nmaybe you didn't expect them to do and\n\n682\n00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:15.440\ngive you a cool output.\n\n683\n00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.940\nSo they are a lot of fun that way.\n\n684\n00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:19.090\nVonne, we do appreciate you time and\neffort on this.\n\n685\n00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:21.760\nWe do thank our good audience for\nwatching, but guess what?\n\n686\n00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.130\nThat's right, we're there yet again.\n\n687\n00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:25.370\nTime for us to sign off for OfficePro TV.\n\n688\n00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:26.920\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n689\n00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:27.550\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n690\n00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:30.052\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n691\n00:31:30.052 --> 00:31:31.761\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

to another great\nepisode of OfficeProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.984 --> 00:00:20.070\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n5\n00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.612\nwe're coming back at\nyou in our Excel 2016.\n\n6\n00:00:22.612 --> 00:00:25.188\nWe are having a good time with charts and\npivot tables,\n\n7\n00:00:25.188 --> 00:00:27.110\nthat's what we're doing today.\n\n8\n00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.359\nJoining us together in this studio\nwith us, our good friend, Mrs.\n\n9\n00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.323\nVonne Smith, Vonne,\nwe're glad to have you back yet again.\n\n10\n00:00:33.323 --> 00:00:35.712\nWe kind of changed our background for\nthe good old folks out there, but\n\n11\n00:00:35.712 --> 00:00:37.184\nI kind of like it, I don't know about you.\n\n12\n00:00:37.184 --> 00:00:43.980\n&gt;&gt; Right, I know, we've changed rooms,\nI call this the Anderson Cooper set.\n\n13\n00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.065\nThat's what it reminds me of every\nsingle time that I'm in here.\n\n14\n00:00:47.065 --> 00:00:51.390\n[LAUGH] So yes, we are back for\nsome more pivot tables and\n\n15\n00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.220\npivot charts, and in this one,\nwe are doing charts.\n\n16\n00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.495\nNow what makes a pivot chart\ndifferent than a regular chart?\n\n17\n00:00:58.495 --> 00:01:01.844\nWell not much honestly, but\nthen also a lot, it's weird.\n\n18\n00:01:01.844 --> 00:01:04.767\nIt's one of those yes but\nno, no but yes type things.\n\n19\n00:01:04.767 --> 00:01:08.229\n&gt;&gt; It's like a DNA thing, where you\nhave two things are very similar,\n\n20\n00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.147\nand yet when you look at them down on\nthe DNA level, vastly different [LAUGH].\n\n21\n00:01:12.147 --> 00:01:17.641\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, so the nice thing about\na pivot chart, and I'm probably gonna\n\n22\n00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:22.734\nmix these up a couple of times,\nit's really just charting a pivot table.\n\n23\n00:01:22.734 --> 00:01:24.729\nThey need to be together,\n\n24\n00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:30.359\nyou can't have a pivot chart without\na pivot table, so they go together.\n\n25\n00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:33.348\nAnd it's just like, if you think about,\nwe're already in Excel,\n\n26\n00:01:33.348 --> 00:01:35.680\nit' s in a tabular type format anyways.\n\n27\n00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.650\nSo we have rows and\ncolumns, you take that and\n\n28\n00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.840\nyou go ahead and chart the information,\nso in that sense, it's the same idea.\n\n29\n00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.350\nWe've gotta take this and\n\n30\n00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.290\nmake it into a graphical representation\nof our data, rather than just numbers.\n\n31\n00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.517\nAnd so once you get it into being a chart,\nit works exactly like a regular chart\n\n32\n00:01:52.517 --> 00:01:55.070\nin the sense of you can\nformat the data series.\n\n33\n00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.472\nYou can go ahead and format the\nbackground, and make it different colors,\n\n34\n00:01:58.472 --> 00:02:00.540\nstyles, and all those same things.\n\n35\n00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.300\nIt's just that the next\nlevel of interactivity it\n\n36\n00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.850\nhas is the filters just like\nyou have any pivot table.\n\n37\n00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.320\nRemember, we had the drop downs, and\n\n38\n00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.610\nwe could choose them on all\nthose kind of different things.\n\n39\n00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.326\nAnd it's all dynamic, it never changes\nour source data, that kinda thing, so\n\n40\n00:02:17.326 --> 00:02:19.058\nthere's that kind of explanation.\n\n41\n00:02:19.058 --> 00:02:20.326\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's the same but different,\n\n42\n00:02:20.326 --> 00:02:21.156\nbut different but the same.\n\n43\n00:02:21.156 --> 00:02:22.347\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] so\n\n44\n00:02:22.347 --> 00:02:25.010\nwe're gonna go ahead and\njump down into the computer.\n\n45\n00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.160\nAnd I have the same file that we were\nworking with, called Pivot Tables, from,\n\n46\n00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.400\nwell, when we made a pivot table.\n\n47\n00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.969\nSo, I would suggest, before we get\nstarted with this, if you have not seen\n\n48\n00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:38.271\nthe episode on creating a basic\npivot table, go back and watch that.\n\n49\n00:02:38.271 --> 00:02:41.830\nCuz we're not really going to concentrate\ntoo much on pivot tables directly.\n\n50\n00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.522\nAnd the other one would be, go ahead and\nwatch some of the formatting a basic chart\n\n51\n00:02:46.522 --> 00:02:49.360\nseries, it's not a series,\nit's an episode.\n\n52\n00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.349\nBut the show that we have on that, because\nwe're not gonna get too deep into all\n\n53\n00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.750\nthe nuances of how you could go ahead and\nformat a chart.\n\n54\n00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.081\nSo, take those together,\nput them into here, all right, so\n\n55\n00:03:00.081 --> 00:03:04.310\nwe have some information here in our\nsales of, what was the customer's name,\n\n56\n00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.189\nwhat was their address, or city.\n\n57\n00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:10.024\nI can go ahead and zoom in this a little\nbit, but I'll zoom it back out,\n\n58\n00:03:10.024 --> 00:03:11.522\nto keep that area in there.\n\n59\n00:03:11.522 --> 00:03:13.773\nDaniel, you're one of our\nsales representatives.\n\n60\n00:03:13.773 --> 00:03:14.882\n&gt;&gt; I hope I've done well.\n\n61\n00:03:14.882 --> 00:03:16.829\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you do pretty good,\nbut you know what,\n\n62\n00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.863\nwe're going to have to chart it to see\nif you did more than Bob or Alice.\n\n63\n00:03:19.863 --> 00:03:23.693\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully, I'm pulling my weight,\nso I don't get the big ax.\n\n64\n00:03:23.693 --> 00:03:26.114\nI've been working, boss,\ncome on, now [LAUGH].\n\n65\n00:03:26.114 --> 00:03:29.400\n&gt;&gt; So we have our different categories\nof a unit price, quantity, and total.\n\n66\n00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.660\nSo I'm just kinda making some\ninformation up that might be\n\n67\n00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.640\nmore towards what people would look for\nin Excel and having this information.\n\n68\n00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.885\nSo we're going to wanna chart\nthe information here, and\n\n69\n00:03:41.885 --> 00:03:45.342\nthis is where we're going\nto be able to pivot.\n\n70\n00:03:45.342 --> 00:03:48.568\nTaking and making it like a turn and\neverything of doing like the,\n\n71\n00:03:48.568 --> 00:03:51.277\nremember the matrix that we\nbuilt in the pivot tables.\n\n72\n00:03:51.277 --> 00:03:55.227\nSame idea here, but\nyou do need to think about, all right,\n\n73\n00:03:55.227 --> 00:04:00.682\nI have to remember when I'm using charts,\nwhat is a series and what is a category?\n\n74\n00:04:00.682 --> 00:04:03.990\nWhat is my x-axis, what is my y-axis,\nwhat is my legend?\n\n75\n00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.720\nSo all that terminology is going to come\nback into play when you go ahead and\n\n76\n00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.060\ninsert a pivot chart.\n\n77\n00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.100\nSo we're going to condense all this\ninformation down, and I want to be able to\n\n78\n00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:22.270\nsee the total sales by category,\nby sales representative.\n\n79\n00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.770\nSo if you think about,\nwhat do I want on the bottom of my chart?\n\n80\n00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.610\nAnd what do I want to have on the legend\nto show the different series?\n\n81\n00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.300\nSo those are that terminology coming back,\nso we can see, we have Toys, Food,\n\n82\n00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.070\nClothing, Accessories, and\nwe have Bob, Alice, and Daniel.\n\n83\n00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.930\nWe're going to just click\nsomewhere in our contiguous range\n\n84\n00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.220\nof information right here.\n\n85\n00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.424\nI'm going to zoom out, so\nwe can see this a little bit better.\n\n86\n00:04:45.424 --> 00:04:48.176\nYou're not going to see the details\nbetter, more when we get into the charts\n\n87\n00:04:48.176 --> 00:04:50.950\nover here, you're like,\nI don't really see that at all.\n\n88\n00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.270\nWe don't need anything over on\nthese first couple of columns.\n\n89\n00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.990\nWe really need from column H over,\nfrom what we're going to be charting.\n\n90\n00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.710\nAll the other information is all\nof our customer information.\n\n91\n00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.140\nSo we're gonna go to insert, and\nwe're gonna go to pivot chart, and notice,\n\n92\n00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.810\nI am doing pivot chart, table's over here.\n\n93\n00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.330\nBut soon as I do a pivot chart,\nit is going to grab that\n\n94\n00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.180\narea of information that I have my\ncursor in, it sees the boundaries.\n\n95\n00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.770\nIt does have, you always gotta make\nsure you have your heading row,\n\n96\n00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.450\nyour header rows.\n\n97\n00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:29.320\nAnd you don't wanna have any blank data,\nwe talked about that in the pivot table.\n\n98\n00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.990\nI do wanna put in the existing worksheet,\njust so we can kinda keep the data and\n\n99\n00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.880\nthe information, what we're doing in\nour chart, next to each other, so\n\n100\n00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.630\nwe can kind of get a better visual.\n\n101\n00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.254\nPut in your cursor in where\nwe want the location,\n\n102\n00:05:42.254 --> 00:05:46.811\nI'm gonna click my cursor out here on like\nO1, to get that information over there.\n\n103\n00:05:46.811 --> 00:05:51.384\nWe click OK, and then,\nlet me scoot on over, notice that,\n\n104\n00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:54.720\nyou can't have a chart without a table.\n\n105\n00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.473\nSo it went ahead and said,\n\n106\n00:05:56.473 --> 00:06:01.433\nI will make a pivot type chart off of\nthe pivot table you're going to make.\n\n107\n00:06:01.433 --> 00:06:04.932\nLet's go ahead and undo that,\nI grabbed the wrong part.\n\n108\n00:06:04.932 --> 00:06:08.435\nMake sure when you're doing the moving,\nyou've got the four pointers over\n\n109\n00:06:08.435 --> 00:06:11.230\nthe whole thing,\nnot the individual pieces of it.\n\n110\n00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.780\nI'm going to move this guy over here and\nmove this over here, so\n\n111\n00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.290\nyou can see it a little bit more as well.\n\n112\n00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.030\nAnd actually, a lot of the stuff's\ngoing to be behind my head, so\n\n113\n00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:21.640\nwhy don't we go ahead and look at this.\n\n114\n00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:26.070\nOne thing you really need to be very\naware of is which one you're clicking on.\n\n115\n00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:29.270\nRight now,\nI have the pivot chart selected, and so\n\n116\n00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:35.100\nlook down here where it says we have\nfilters, legend, and then access.\n\n117\n00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.940\nSo you can see series, and\nthen access category and values.\n\n118\n00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.523\nThat makes a big difference if you\nclick over here on the pivot table.\n\n119\n00:06:43.523 --> 00:06:48.684\nSo if I click here on the pivot table,\nlet's try that again,\n\n120\n00:06:48.684 --> 00:06:52.514\nlet's go ahead and see why won't you.\n\n121\n00:06:52.514 --> 00:06:55.355\n[LAUGH] you know what I was looking for?\n\n122\n00:06:55.355 --> 00:06:59.931\nI was looking for the box,\nsee how this one turns like the box.\n\n123\n00:06:59.931 --> 00:07:00.490\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n124\n00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.310\n&gt;&gt; This makes complete sense, because\na chart is a graphical element, and so\n\n125\n00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.689\nit's gonna have it as\nits own selection here.\n\n126\n00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:08.944\nIt's like, I'm already in the pivot table,\nI'm just not paying attention [LAUGH].\n\n127\n00:07:08.944 --> 00:07:10.725\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n128\n00:07:10.725 --> 00:07:13.160\nyou should always look over\nhere on the task pane.\n\n129\n00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.580\nIt says pivot table, okay,\nI'm in the pivot table.\n\n130\n00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.804\nBehind my head, you can see that we have\nnow, look at the fields where it says,\n\n131\n00:07:20.804 --> 00:07:22.855\nfilters, columns, rows, values.\n\n132\n00:07:22.855 --> 00:07:26.568\n&gt;&gt; Looking familiar from when we\ndid the charts, or the tables.\n\n133\n00:07:26.568 --> 00:07:30.908\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yeah, [CROSSTALK] l know,\nyou're flipping them back and forth.\n\n134\n00:07:30.908 --> 00:07:34.393\nBut notice again,\nif I click over on the chart,\n\n135\n00:07:34.393 --> 00:07:38.678\nit says pivot chart, and\nnow it says legend and category.\n\n136\n00:07:38.678 --> 00:07:43.411\nHonestly, it's one of those, since the\nchart is going to be charting the table,\n\n137\n00:07:43.411 --> 00:07:46.772\ndo you want to do the table first and\nthe chart goes ahead and\n\n138\n00:07:46.772 --> 00:07:49.535\nis created off of whatever\nyou put in the table.\n\n139\n00:07:49.535 --> 00:07:51.408\n&gt;&gt; It's the chicken and\nthe egg thing, isn't it?\n\n140\n00:07:51.408 --> 00:07:52.047\n&gt;&gt; My gosh, so bad.\n\n141\n00:07:52.047 --> 00:07:57.396\n&gt;&gt; So let's say you do the table first,\nit's going to start showing up.\n\n142\n00:07:57.396 --> 00:07:58.810\nIn the chart.\n\n143\n00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.574\nBut you're like well I want my\nchart to look a certain way.\n\n144\n00:08:00.574 --> 00:08:05.150\nI could start there, and\nthen the table will be built accordingly.\n\n145\n00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:06.472\nAm I on the right track?\n\n146\n00:08:06.472 --> 00:08:09.540\n&gt;&gt; Yes I'm doing the hand motions for\nexactly what you're saying.\n\n147\n00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:12.680\nYes and this is why it is\nextremely back and forth.\n\n148\n00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.220\nSo it's really almost like which\none do you want to work in?\n\n149\n00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:19.240\n&gt;&gt; I guess it would depend on what\nyou're doing at that point and time.\n\n150\n00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.146\n&gt;&gt; What's your mindset, really.\n\n151\n00:08:20.146 --> 00:08:22.290\nAnd you can go back and\nforth, which is perfect.\n\n152\n00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:26.160\nLet's stick with the chart since\nthis is the episode title.\n\n153\n00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:26.930\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n154\n00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:31.410\n&gt;&gt; So I'll make sure I have the chart\nselected here on the Excel spreadsheet.\n\n155\n00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:37.820\nAnd then over here in my task pane we said\nthat we wanted to do the total sales.\n\n156\n00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.890\nSo that column right here called Total.\n\n157\n00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.240\nSo we're gonna drag the field,\n\n158\n00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.230\nwe're gonna take the Total and\nwe're gonna drag it into the values,\n\n159\n00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:48.450\nbecause I know that that is what I'm going\nto be, that's the total of everything.\n\n160\n00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:49.676\nThe total of the total.\n\n161\n00:08:49.676 --> 00:08:51.190\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; The total of the total.\n\n162\n00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:54.200\n&gt;&gt; What I want along the bottom,\nmy category axis,\n\n163\n00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.020\nthat's the one that goes on the x-axis.\n\n164\n00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:02.080\nI wanna go ahead and put that into, let's\nput, Category meaning within the data.\n\n165\n00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:06.210\nLook at the categories are like toys,\nfood, clothing, accessories.\n\n166\n00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.200\nCuz remember we're doing\nour Christmas cuts and\n\n167\n00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.250\nthe sales of what you're\ngoing to be selling.\n\n168\n00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:13.670\nSo now you can see in this chart,\nI like this a little bit bigger so\n\n169\n00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:18.090\nit might be a little bit easier for\nyou to see It gets a little small.\n\n170\n00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:22.680\nAnd that's why a lot of times people\nwill put this on its own sheet,\n\n171\n00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.480\nnot necessarily in\nthe data that it lives in.\n\n172\n00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.490\nBut for these lesson purposes,\nwill be easier.\n\n173\n00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:32.470\nSo now I've got my categories,\nI can see accessories closing, okay.\n\n174\n00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:36.970\nNow I wanna see, the series,\nthe columns that go up.\n\n175\n00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:39.100\nI want those to be our sales reps.\n\n176\n00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.190\nSo let's come over here to the test pane.\n\n177\n00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:44.750\nWe will grab our Sales Reps,\nthat's right here,\n\n178\n00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:48.740\nand we're gonna drag it down to\nthe legend, which is right there.\n\n179\n00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.990\nAnd as soon as I say legend.\n\n180\n00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:51.905\nWell there you go.\n\n181\n00:09:51.905 --> 00:09:52.690\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] Look at that.\n\n182\n00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:57.990\n&gt;&gt; Right, and that's again, if I'm\nthinking more in this graphical sense,\n\n183\n00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:02.750\nI wanna see category,\nmy categories of the two,\n\n184\n00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:05.920\nI should of named this differently.\n\n185\n00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Toys, food, and clothing,\n\n186\n00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.800\naccessories along the bottom.\n\n187\n00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.630\nAnd then each sales person is\ngonna be the different columns and\n\n188\n00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:13.790\nthat's my legend, sweet.\n\n189\n00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:16.970\nAnd now, once I have this,\nyou can see that this is a chart and\n\n190\n00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:21.030\ndidn't make, like I said,\nthe table right on up here.\n\n191\n00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:25.860\nBecause if I click over here in\nthe table up there, notice over here in\n\n192\n00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:30.470\nthe task pane again, kind of like\nwe're really driving this home.\n\n193\n00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:34.200\nYou can see it says columns and\nrows over here behind my head and\n\n194\n00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.280\nthe values are the same.\n\n195\n00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.380\nSo all the same information,\n\n196\n00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:41.040\nit's like do I do it in a table,\ndo I do it in the chart?\n\n197\n00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:46.400\nAll right perfect, now,\nonce you are on the chart here notice you\n\n198\n00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:51.850\nhave your different contextual tabs just\nlike you would if this was a normal chart.\n\n199\n00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:53.660\nI have things like design.\n\n200\n00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.580\nAnd what are all the different\nthings that we can add on our chart?\n\n201\n00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:00.130\nWe could come over here to the quick\nlayouts to where it will go ahead and\n\n202\n00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:04.420\ngive us a quick layout of things\nof different chart elements.\n\n203\n00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:06.550\nDo I want data labels on here?\n\n204\n00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:08.070\nDo I want a data table?\n\n205\n00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:12.330\nDo I want my grid lines all on these\ndifferent things that we can add in to\n\n206\n00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.320\nmake this chart look the way\nwe want it to represent?\n\n207\n00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.480\nAnd you can also of course\nthrow on a style on here.\n\n208\n00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.060\nAll the different ways that we can do it.\n\n209\n00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:23.230\nI am going to just keep it basic for now.\n\n210\n00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:26.730\nEven keep the same colors of\nwhat is going on here because\n\n211\n00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:28.200\nthat's a whole episode in itself and\n\n212\n00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.450\nwe can go way beyond that rabbit hole\nof making everything look really.\n\n213\n00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:32.860\nI use to make really ugly charts.\n\n214\n00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.780\n[LAUGH] But the same thing here.\n\n215\n00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:38.790\nWhat if I want to go ahead and switch the\nrow and column data, basically saying all\n\n216\n00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:45.110\nright let me go ahead and put Daniel,\nAlice, and Bob down at the bottom.\n\n217\n00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:46.420\nThose are gonna be my categories.\n\n218\n00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:50.200\nAnd then the series becomes the toys,\naccessories, and clothing.\n\n219\n00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:54.470\nSo different categories of sales that we\nhave for Christmas Cats Incorporated.\n\n220\n00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:56.480\nSo you still have all\nthis same information.\n\n221\n00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.930\nWhat if I don't know if\nthat was the right stuff?\n\n222\n00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:00.860\nNotice when you select the data,\n\n223\n00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.450\nthis looks the exact same\nin a regular chart too.\n\n224\n00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:07.810\nBut again, when you're doing\nthings within a pivot chart,\n\n225\n00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:11.350\nyou really wanna use the task pane over\nhere, on the right, because that's where\n\n226\n00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:15.090\nwe're going to be collecting all that\ninformation, consolidating that.\n\n227\n00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:18.550\nYou don't necessarily wanna come out\nhere and start selecting the data,\n\n228\n00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:20.170\nindividually.\n\n229\n00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:22.320\nBecause then,\nyou should just be using a regular chart.\n\n230\n00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.510\nOkay and then, we have the other stuff.\n\n231\n00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.640\nYou can make it into\na different type of chart.\n\n232\n00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.550\nYou can make a 3D chart.\n\n233\n00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.650\nYou can do the stacked ones.\n\n234\n00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:33.840\nYou can do bar charts and so on and so\nforth that we did in our other lessons.\n\n235\n00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:34.580\n&gt;&gt; Go wild.\n\n236\n00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:35.720\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n237\n00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:39.200\nThis is where Back Suit,\nit's the same as a regular chart.\n\n238\n00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.860\nYou can always move it as well.\n\n239\n00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.190\nYou can also come into\nthe different pieces here.\n\n240\n00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:45.320\nI'm going to click that off.\n\n241\n00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:49.730\nIf I wanted to format this particular\ndata series, you can right click\n\n242\n00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:53.010\nGo into that format data series, because\nthese were the different things we talked\n\n243\n00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:57.150\nabout like the series overlap of\nmaking those calls come together, and\n\n244\n00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:59.980\nthen the gap between each\none of those categories.\n\n245\n00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:02.480\nChange them all, all sorts of fun stuff.\n\n246\n00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:06.710\nNow notice that this is one of those\nthings that we're talking about the total\n\n247\n00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:11.420\ncolumn within our data last\nformatted as money, right.\n\n248\n00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.180\nWell right now,\nit just looks like regular numbers.\n\n249\n00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:16.680\nLike, how do I know that\nthis is actually sales?\n\n250\n00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:21.210\nThis kind of goes back into\nthe pivot table information, and\n\n251\n00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:25.530\nover here on the right hand side of my\npivot chart fields down at the bottom,\n\n252\n00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:29.560\nwhere it says values, it's summing it up,\nand that's what I would like to do.\n\n253\n00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.610\nAgain, we did a lot of this stuff\nin the pivot tables episode.\n\n254\n00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:35.650\nWell, I wanna change my\nvalue field settings.\n\n255\n00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:39.100\nAnd then I can change\nthe number format over here.\n\n256\n00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.770\nI'd like it to be in accounting.\n\n257\n00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:43.240\nAnd that will automatically go ahead and\n\n258\n00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.820\nput that dollar sign\ninto two decimal places.\n\n259\n00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:51.070\nAnd now when I click OK, now the thing\nis [LAUGH] since this is in a chart\n\n260\n00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:57.020\nthe picture doesn't change, but really\nchanges is over here on the value axis.\n\n261\n00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:01.490\nAnd I could have totally done that by\nformatting the value axis of the chart, or\n\n262\n00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:03.680\nI could have gone to the table and, okay.\n\n263\n00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.620\nSo many different places, same play.\n\n264\n00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:07.830\nIt's just which one do\nyou want to go with?\n\n265\n00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:10.190\nSo you can go like so and\n\n266\n00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:13.610\nthat's where we could go ahead and\ndo some fun stuff like that.\n\n267\n00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:18.100\nAnd the cool thing is,\nif you start changing your table and\n\n268\n00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:20.910\nhow you wanna filter the information,\nit's gonna change the chart.\n\n269\n00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:23.990\nOr, you could go right in here to\nthe chart, because look, it says, well,\n\n270\n00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:28.545\nmaybe I only wanna see Daniel,\nlet's see how you did there.\n\n271\n00:14:28.545 --> 00:14:30.195\nWe'll click OK and wow.\n\n272\n00:14:30.195 --> 00:14:31.085\n&gt;&gt; Fingers crossed.\n\n273\n00:14:31.085 --> 00:14:32.440\n&gt;&gt; You did really good at selling food.\n\n274\n00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.260\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, I like food so-\n\n275\n00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:34.975\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n276\n00:14:34.975 --> 00:14:35.985\n&gt;&gt; My forte.\n\n277\n00:14:35.985 --> 00:14:37.415\n&gt;&gt; Well you know how to talk to the cats.\n\n278\n00:14:37.415 --> 00:14:39.147\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Like, hey, this food's really good,\n\n279\n00:14:39.147 --> 00:14:40.247\nthe chicken and cheese, mm.\n\n280\n00:14:40.247 --> 00:14:43.888\n&gt;&gt; Mm, I could get you salivating over\na nice pizza pie, that's for sure.\n\n281\n00:14:43.888 --> 00:14:44.747\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n282\n00:14:44.747 --> 00:14:49.717\nSo you can see that you have the same\nfilters and the way that you could change\n\n283\n00:14:49.717 --> 00:14:54.998\nthis data really quickly in a\n&gt;&gt; Pivot chart the same way you have it in\n\n284\n00:14:54.998 --> 00:14:55.858\na pivot table.\n\n285\n00:14:55.858 --> 00:14:59.138\nSo maybe I only want to see the clothing.\n\n286\n00:14:59.138 --> 00:15:02.368\nAlright, so well you're not as good\nas Alice in the clothing department.\n\n287\n00:15:02.368 --> 00:15:03.463\nSo I can see there.\n\n288\n00:15:03.463 --> 00:15:06.138\n&gt;&gt; Well, she's kind of got\na leg up on me on that, so.\n\n289\n00:15:06.138 --> 00:15:08.658\n&gt;&gt; She does have a really good\nfashion sense for herself.\n\n290\n00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:09.848\n&gt;&gt; She does, she does.\n\n291\n00:15:09.848 --> 00:15:13.052\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So you can see that we've got\nall of these different ways that we can\n\n292\n00:15:13.052 --> 00:15:14.187\nfilter out the information.\n\n293\n00:15:14.187 --> 00:15:18.074\nThat's the whole idea of having this\nlike interactive chart that's based on\n\n294\n00:15:18.074 --> 00:15:19.040\nyour pivot table.\n\n295\n00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.710\nAll right, let's scroll out a little bit.\n\n296\n00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:24.940\nThe other thing that I would like to point\nout is some changes, like what if I went\n\n297\n00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:29.210\nahead and changed the information, like\nthis person right here and you know what?\n\n298\n00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:31.330\nWe'll do it for you there, Daniel.\n\n299\n00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:35.044\nThis person, let's see,\nwell whoever is this person.\n\n300\n00:15:35.044 --> 00:15:37.887\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] They didn't buy 4 quantities\n\n301\n00:15:37.887 --> 00:15:39.610\nthey bought 40.\n\n302\n00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:41.440\nWell because everything has formulas and\n\n303\n00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:45.070\neverything that's $480 in sales,\nthat's a big difference.\n\n304\n00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:48.757\nBut nothing changed over here,\nit didn't I didn't point it out but\n\n305\n00:15:48.757 --> 00:15:50.063\nit definitely did not.\n\n306\n00:15:50.063 --> 00:15:53.862\nBecause the information,\nyou have to tell it hey I went out and\n\n307\n00:15:53.862 --> 00:15:55.991\nactually changed my source data.\n\n308\n00:15:55.991 --> 00:15:58.042\nSo you need to be-\n&gt;&gt; You need to update.\n\n309\n00:15:58.042 --> 00:16:01.359\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we need the refresh button.\n\n310\n00:16:01.359 --> 00:16:04.033\nAnd again, chart or table,\ncuz they all connected.\n\n311\n00:16:04.033 --> 00:16:08.884\nI wanna go ahead and pick on the chart,\nand I come over here to, there it is,\n\n312\n00:16:08.884 --> 00:16:13.911\non the Analyze tab, we have this Refresh\nand then your number, there you go.\n\n313\n00:16:13.911 --> 00:16:16.522\nSince clothing is an orange,\nthat shot that up, so\n\n314\n00:16:16.522 --> 00:16:19.270\nnow you can see you're\nleading in the clothing.\n\n315\n00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:19.939\n&gt;&gt; Good for me.\n\n316\n00:16:19.939 --> 00:16:23.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So if you ever change\nyour data, make sure you go back and\n\n317\n00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:24.221\nrefresh it.\n\n318\n00:16:24.221 --> 00:16:29.904\nAnd of course it did refresh in the table\nas well, so kinda some fun things to do.\n\n319\n00:16:29.904 --> 00:16:33.991\nNow, this one right here is showing\nus the sum of the total, so,\n\n320\n00:16:33.991 --> 00:16:36.664\nwe're doing total sales of everything.\n\n321\n00:16:36.664 --> 00:16:41.331\nWhat if I wanted to then\nalso see the quantity?\n\n322\n00:16:41.331 --> 00:16:45.669\nI wanna see the quantity sold by\nsales representatives by category,\n\n323\n00:16:45.669 --> 00:16:49.649\nwell, if you're doing that,\nit's a separate chart, okay?\n\n324\n00:16:49.649 --> 00:16:53.165\nAnd this is kind of going back to, we've\nhad this conversation about charts and\n\n325\n00:16:53.165 --> 00:16:56.066\ntables, or really charts,\nit's like, it can chart anything.\n\n326\n00:16:56.066 --> 00:16:58.581\nIt doesn't mean it's gonna make any sense,\nright?\n\n327\n00:16:58.581 --> 00:17:02.164\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's kinda gotta have some\ncorrelation, otherwise it's like,\n\n328\n00:17:02.164 --> 00:17:03.738\nwhat are you charting against?\n\n329\n00:17:03.738 --> 00:17:05.841\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; This is\nsomething that I struggled with,\n\n330\n00:17:05.841 --> 00:17:07.171\nbecause I'm not an Excel user.\n\n331\n00:17:07.171 --> 00:17:11.390\nI'm learning Excel watching Vonne here,\nas maybe some of you are as well.\n\n332\n00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:15.159\nI didn't understand that they\nhave to have some connection so\n\n333\n00:17:15.159 --> 00:17:16.760\nthat you can make it work.\n\n334\n00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.447\nIt's not just, hey, let's grab information\nand throw it in a chart and watch it go,\n\n335\n00:17:20.447 --> 00:17:21.534\nthere's nothing to go.\n\n336\n00:17:21.534 --> 00:17:25.692\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and especially with these pivot\ntables, cuz we could now with, wait,\n\n337\n00:17:25.692 --> 00:17:26.957\nsorry, I already did.\n\n338\n00:17:26.957 --> 00:17:30.636\nIn a pivot table, that's where,\nif I wanted to kinda break it down,\n\n339\n00:17:30.636 --> 00:17:35.012\nnow I clicked back in the pivot table, and\nI'll come over here to the panel again so\n\n340\n00:17:35.012 --> 00:17:35.722\nyou can see.\n\n341\n00:17:35.722 --> 00:17:39.840\nAnd I love tables, because if I\nmove the column behind my head,\n\n342\n00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:45.200\nif I took the category and put it over to\nsales reps, without looking at the chart,\n\n343\n00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:49.732\nI love how pivot tables do this\nwhole breakdown, it's really neat.\n\n344\n00:17:49.732 --> 00:17:53.241\nAnd then we could even go ahead and\nput it by, not city, let's do state.\n\n345\n00:17:53.241 --> 00:17:54.996\nAnd then we could do it by state, and\n\n346\n00:17:54.996 --> 00:17:57.695\nwe talked about how I could\nbreak it all down like that.\n\n347\n00:17:57.695 --> 00:18:03.180\nGreat in the table, but then my chart\nstarts to get a little, I mean,\n\n348\n00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:08.873\nit still makes sense, but it's kind\nof harder to see at a quick glance.\n\n349\n00:18:08.873 --> 00:18:10.485\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Like what am I looking at, you know?\n\n350\n00:18:10.485 --> 00:18:11.141\n[LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n351\n00:18:11.141 --> 00:18:13.692\n&gt;&gt; It looks like data,\nit has no real information yet.\n\n352\n00:18:13.692 --> 00:18:17.843\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't, I can't read it,\nI can't read it clearly.\n\n353\n00:18:17.843 --> 00:18:23.035\nSo what if I wanted to have\none chart show one thing and\n\n354\n00:18:23.035 --> 00:18:27.403\nanother chart show another thing by state,\n\n355\n00:18:27.403 --> 00:18:30.959\nby representative, by whatever?\n\n356\n00:18:30.959 --> 00:18:35.062\n&gt;&gt; So you're adding that context,\nyou're saying this chart is by state,\n\n357\n00:18:35.062 --> 00:18:37.769\nthis chart is by county,\nor whatever, right?\n\n358\n00:18:37.769 --> 00:18:40.801\nSalesperson, and you just throw\nthat in there, and then I tell you,\n\n359\n00:18:40.801 --> 00:18:43.114\nthis is a state chart,\nthis is a salesperson chart.\n\n360\n00:18:43.114 --> 00:18:46.676\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\nthat we're talking multiple charts, okay?\n\n361\n00:18:46.676 --> 00:18:50.587\nSo this is where you would go back and\ndo the exact same thing, and\n\n362\n00:18:50.587 --> 00:18:55.094\nmake a whole separate pivot table and\npivot chart to go ahead and get that.\n\n363\n00:18:55.094 --> 00:18:57.022\n&gt;&gt; We're picking up what your\nputting down there, Vonne.\n\n364\n00:18:57.022 --> 00:18:57.943\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Awesome, yay!\n\n365\n00:18:57.943 --> 00:18:59.444\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we're going to go ahead and\n\n366\n00:18:59.444 --> 00:19:01.823\nthrow these up, I'm going to\ncome over here to these fields.\n\n367\n00:19:01.823 --> 00:19:05.583\nAnd remember, how to get rid of them over\nhere is you just start dragging them out,\n\n368\n00:19:05.583 --> 00:19:07.835\nso behind my head,\nwe're dragging the fields.\n\n369\n00:19:07.835 --> 00:19:12.121\nSo to just to show you, I went here and\ntook the state, I just took it out and\n\n370\n00:19:12.121 --> 00:19:13.308\njust throw it away.\n\n371\n00:19:13.308 --> 00:19:15.962\nI put the category back up to here,\nall right,\n\n372\n00:19:15.962 --> 00:19:18.560\nnow we've got this chart\nmaking more sense.\n\n373\n00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:23.013\nOkay, now, I'd like to, whoops, see,\nI always do that, get the four corner\n\n374\n00:19:23.013 --> 00:19:26.881\non the whole thing, so now I need to\ncome back and do a separate chart.\n\n375\n00:19:26.881 --> 00:19:31.219\nAnd this is where adding the elements\nup here, like on the design,\n\n376\n00:19:31.219 --> 00:19:35.717\nputting a chart title, and\nmaking sure that you're labeling this.\n\n377\n00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:40.185\nSo this is going to be a bi-category,\nor no, this is sales,\n\n378\n00:19:40.185 --> 00:19:45.545\ntotal sales, so keep my brain in order\nto remember which chart is which.\n\n379\n00:19:45.545 --> 00:19:51.129\nSo now what we want to do is go ahead and\ncome back over to the original data.\n\n380\n00:19:51.129 --> 00:19:54.114\nGo ahead and\ninsert another pivot chart and table,\n\n381\n00:19:54.114 --> 00:19:58.084\nwhich it says it right there too,\nbut we'll just go with the chart.\n\n382\n00:19:58.084 --> 00:20:01.092\nUnderstands where it is, we're gonna\nput it in the existing worksheet.\n\n383\n00:20:01.092 --> 00:20:06.080\nWe're gonna click our cursor, but then\nwe're gonna come down here, let's put it\n\n384\n00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:10.727\nover here just for fun, click OK,\nputs everything in there, I get my chart.\n\n385\n00:20:10.727 --> 00:20:13.757\nSo now I want to,\nlet's come over here to the Task pane,\n\n386\n00:20:13.757 --> 00:20:17.442\nwe're gonna do the Quantity,\nwe're gonna put that in the Values.\n\n387\n00:20:17.442 --> 00:20:22.518\nSo we're summing up the quantities,\nand we'll still go ahead and\n\n388\n00:20:22.518 --> 00:20:26.970\ndo the category as the legend and\nthe sales rep as the axis.\n\n389\n00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:29.618\nSo a little different here, or\nactually this is the same thing,\n\n390\n00:20:29.618 --> 00:20:30.901\nokay, perfect, wonderful.\n\n391\n00:20:30.901 --> 00:20:31.789\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n392\n00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:33.804\n&gt;&gt; So I've got that down here.\n\n393\n00:20:33.804 --> 00:20:38.876\nAnd so now, with this chart title,\nwe would say, we'd come over here,\n\n394\n00:20:38.876 --> 00:20:43.466\nadd this, add a title, third above,\nwe will double click on it.\n\n395\n00:20:43.466 --> 00:20:47.514\nAnd triple click to have everything\nselected, and this is quantity, okay?\n\n396\n00:20:47.514 --> 00:20:52.536\nQuantity, so quantity,\nlet's pretend I can spell, sold,\n\n397\n00:20:52.536 --> 00:20:58.539\nyeah, okay, good enough, yeah,\nstop, all right, perfect, [LAUGH].\n\n398\n00:20:58.539 --> 00:20:59.059\n&gt;&gt; Go.\n\n399\n00:20:59.059 --> 00:21:00.458\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, good enough, all right, so\n\n400\n00:21:00.458 --> 00:21:01.201\nnow that's kind of neat.\n\n401\n00:21:01.201 --> 00:21:05.401\nNow the whole thing about these filters,\nright, these drop downs,\n\n402\n00:21:05.401 --> 00:21:09.024\nthis is something where,\ninstead of coming over here, and\n\n403\n00:21:09.024 --> 00:21:12.731\nclicking the drop downs,\nthere's a thing called a slicer.\n\n404\n00:21:12.731 --> 00:21:16.808\nSlicers are really nice,\nwe're not talking about pizza.\n\n405\n00:21:16.808 --> 00:21:18.337\n&gt;&gt; Come on now, knives then?\n\n406\n00:21:18.337 --> 00:21:19.813\nWith knives?\n\n407\n00:21:19.813 --> 00:21:20.778\n&gt;&gt; See.\n\n408\n00:21:20.778 --> 00:21:21.752\n&gt;&gt; I'm a big knife fan.\n\n409\n00:21:21.752 --> 00:21:24.421\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yes, see,\nhe has a whole collection.\n\n410\n00:21:24.421 --> 00:21:29.196\nI've learned a lot about how to sharpen\na knife, and the different handles and-\n\n411\n00:21:29.196 --> 00:21:30.061\n&gt;&gt; I could do a show.\n\n412\n00:21:30.061 --> 00:21:30.951\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n413\n00:21:30.951 --> 00:21:34.315\nyes, we watched that one series on that\none channel all about making knives.\n\n414\n00:21:34.315 --> 00:21:36.097\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\nthat was pretty cool, wasn't it?\n\n415\n00:21:36.097 --> 00:21:37.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was pretty neat,\nanyways, I digress.\n\n416\n00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:39.592\nI go to pizza, he goes to knives, so.\n\n417\n00:21:39.592 --> 00:21:41.317\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You need a knife to cut the pizza.\n\n418\n00:21:41.317 --> 00:21:46.107\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, the whole idea is we\ncan use buttons to cut our data in\n\n419\n00:21:46.107 --> 00:21:48.249\nthe sense of filtering out.\n\n420\n00:21:48.249 --> 00:21:49.129\n&gt;&gt; That's kinda cool.\n\n421\n00:21:49.129 --> 00:21:49.865\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty neat.\n\n422\n00:21:49.865 --> 00:21:52.833\nIt's more of a button interface\nrather than these drop downs.\n\n423\n00:21:52.833 --> 00:21:55.456\nSo, now I'm going to take\nthis chart right here and\n\n424\n00:21:55.456 --> 00:21:57.970\nI'll make it a little bit\nbigger to make easier.\n\n425\n00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:01.752\nNow remember how I was doing the drop\ndowns on this one, where I said okay,\n\n426\n00:22:01.752 --> 00:22:04.802\nI just want to see you and\nthe clothing versus you and Alice,\n\n427\n00:22:04.802 --> 00:22:06.327\nor something to that effect?\n\n428\n00:22:06.327 --> 00:22:10.213\nSame idea,\nit'll make sense when I show you.\n\n429\n00:22:10.213 --> 00:22:14.402\n[LAUGH] We're gonna come over\nhere to Analyze, and there it is,\n\n430\n00:22:14.402 --> 00:22:16.389\nit's called Insert Slicer.\n\n431\n00:22:16.389 --> 00:22:22.143\nNotice it says slicers are used\nin pivot tables and pivot charts.\n\n432\n00:22:22.143 --> 00:22:25.928\nYou can't just add a slicer to\njust a regular range of data.\n\n433\n00:22:25.928 --> 00:22:28.200\nIt has to be formatted in these\ntypes of different things.\n\n434\n00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:32.665\nSo we're gonna insert a slicer, so what\nI'm going to put, now just to clarify,\n\n435\n00:22:32.665 --> 00:22:35.504\nremember, now I'm selected\non this pivot chart.\n\n436\n00:22:35.504 --> 00:22:39.423\nIf I was not selected on it, when I went\nto do this, it would say, connection\n\n437\n00:22:39.423 --> 00:22:43.429\nnot found, cuz I don't understand what\nI'm supposed to be making buttons.\n\n438\n00:22:43.429 --> 00:22:47.001\nSo I'm gonna say, Sales Rep and\nfor fun, you know what?\n\n439\n00:22:47.001 --> 00:22:49.474\nWe're gonna get two controls,\nit's like remote controls.\n\n440\n00:22:49.474 --> 00:22:53.486\nWe are going to put the category,\nand watch what happens, I click OK,\n\n441\n00:22:53.486 --> 00:22:56.344\nit just adds these little\nbutton looking things.\n\n442\n00:22:56.344 --> 00:22:59.886\nIt's all it really is, and I mean,\nyou could format it and everything, so.\n\n443\n00:22:59.886 --> 00:23:02.683\n&gt;&gt; I like that idea of a remote control,\nI want it to do this, click the button.\n\n444\n00:23:02.683 --> 00:23:04.065\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Want it to do that, click the button.\n\n445\n00:23:04.065 --> 00:23:07.567\n&gt;&gt; And watch, you say, I wanna see what\nDaniel has sold, I click Daniel and\n\n446\n00:23:07.567 --> 00:23:08.378\nit filters out.\n\n447\n00:23:08.378 --> 00:23:09.146\n&gt;&gt; That is so cool.\n\n448\n00:23:09.146 --> 00:23:10.161\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n449\n00:23:10.161 --> 00:23:12.688\nAnd then, it's like okay,\nwell now I want to go ahead and\n\n450\n00:23:12.688 --> 00:23:16.492\nclear that, it's kinda hard to see, but in\nthe top right corner to clear the filter.\n\n451\n00:23:16.492 --> 00:23:19.524\nAll right, well, now let me just see what\nthe clothing looks like, so I'm saying,\n\n452\n00:23:19.524 --> 00:23:22.172\nhere's the clothing, okay,\nDaniel's still winning in the clothing,\n\n453\n00:23:22.172 --> 00:23:23.262\nlet's see the accessories.\n\n454\n00:23:23.262 --> 00:23:27.588\nOkay, Alice beat him in accessories,\nso on and so forth, and so\n\n455\n00:23:27.588 --> 00:23:32.493\nyou can go ahead and make some really\neasy button ways to slice that data.\n\n456\n00:23:32.493 --> 00:23:36.690\nGive me the filters, I love these buttons,\nthey're super easy to add too.\n\n457\n00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:38.676\nYou saw it, you just select the thing and\n\n458\n00:23:38.676 --> 00:23:41.026\nsay what you wanna click\non to make the filters.\n\n459\n00:23:41.026 --> 00:23:44.208\nNow there is this one thing right\nhere where you can do a multi-select,\n\n460\n00:23:44.208 --> 00:23:46.239\nbecause you can see,\nit's one or the other.\n\n461\n00:23:46.239 --> 00:23:48.414\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Without this on, it's like,\n\n462\n00:23:48.414 --> 00:23:51.649\nI see Alice, or I see Daniel,\nI don't do both, but\n\n463\n00:23:51.649 --> 00:23:54.302\nwhat if I wanted to compare you and Alice?\n\n464\n00:23:54.302 --> 00:23:58.178\nSo, if I turn this multi-select on\nthen I can say, all right, well,\n\n465\n00:23:58.178 --> 00:24:00.565\nDaniel and Alice, and now I've got that.\n\n466\n00:24:00.565 --> 00:24:01.188\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n467\n00:24:01.188 --> 00:24:04.449\n&gt;&gt; Let me turn on Bob and turn off Daniel.\n\n468\n00:24:04.449 --> 00:24:06.340\nSo now I have Alice and Bob.\n\n469\n00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:11.507\nCome over here, let's go ahead and\ndo Bob, but let's do clothing.\n\n470\n00:24:11.507 --> 00:24:12.243\nI turned off.\n\n471\n00:24:12.243 --> 00:24:13.907\n&gt;&gt; Now, this is worth\nthe ticket price alone, Vonne.\n\n472\n00:24:13.907 --> 00:24:15.390\n&gt;&gt; Right [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You should've started with this.\n\n473\n00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:17.900\nEveryone's going to go out and\nbuy Excel now.\n\n474\n00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.382\n&gt;&gt; Right?\nYeah, and again,\n\n475\n00:24:19.382 --> 00:24:22.615\nthis could be just on data\nthat's formatted as a table.\n\n476\n00:24:22.615 --> 00:24:25.470\nSo you can just, it doesn't even\nhave to go into the pivot world.\n\n477\n00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:26.850\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Of pivot charts and pivot tables.\n\n478\n00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:28.870\nYou can just throw it on\na regular formatted table and\n\n479\n00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:30.680\ndo the same exact thing.\n\n480\n00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.370\nLove these things.\n\n481\n00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:34.191\nNow, one more level, if you wanna say.\n\n482\n00:24:34.191 --> 00:24:37.025\nRight now, if we're talking\nabout these as remote controls.\n\n483\n00:24:37.025 --> 00:24:38.260\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; It's only remote controlling this\n\n484\n00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:39.560\nchart, isn't it?\n\n485\n00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:45.702\nBut this chart right here is connected\nto this source data as well.\n\n486\n00:24:45.702 --> 00:24:48.580\nSo what if I wanted to have\nit to where it changes both?\n\n487\n00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:51.537\nI want-\n&gt;&gt; That's just too bad cuz that can't be\n\n488\n00:24:51.537 --> 00:24:52.624\ndone, right Vonne?\n\n489\n00:24:52.624 --> 00:24:53.488\n&gt;&gt; But wait.\n\n490\n00:24:53.488 --> 00:24:55.575\n&gt;&gt; There's more.\n&gt;&gt; There's more.\n\n491\n00:24:55.575 --> 00:24:56.149\n[LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n492\n00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:58.310\nYou take this right here.\n\n493\n00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:01.670\nAnd remember,\nI added this slicer to this one.\n\n494\n00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:03.102\nWe're talking about the connections.\n\n495\n00:25:03.102 --> 00:25:03.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n496\n00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.220\nYou can either right click on this or\n\n497\n00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:11.350\nit's right up here in the tab on\nthe ribbon is you can report connections.\n\n498\n00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:13.250\nThere's multiple pivot tables.\n\n499\n00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:16.110\nAnd they both come from\nthe same data source.\n\n500\n00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:20.530\nSo if I say take this remote control and\nmap it to both of these.\n\n501\n00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:22.470\nAnd I could have named these better.\n\n502\n00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:25.300\nInstead of pivot table one,\npivot table two.\n\n503\n00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:29.810\nIf I click OK, now let me zoom out just a\nlittle bit so you can see this happening.\n\n504\n00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:31.040\nJust watch the bars.\n\n505\n00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.170\nSo now let's just go ahead and\nsee Daniel's and\n\n506\n00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:34.810\nnow it changes on both charts.\n\n507\n00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:38.920\nRemember this is the sales,\nthis is the quantity sold, and\n\n508\n00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:42.820\nso that's where I can start making\nmy switchers if you wanna say.\n\n509\n00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:49.110\nDifferent in clearing those out until I\ncan make multiple connections to multiple,\n\n510\n00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:52.640\nSlicers can have multiple connections as\nlong as it has that same data source.\n\n511\n00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.860\nSo that can be pretty fun.\n\n512\n00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:55.982\n&gt;&gt; So I get the slicer.\n\n513\n00:25:55.982 --> 00:25:58.035\nI get the charts, look at the tables, and\n\n514\n00:25:58.035 --> 00:26:00.335\nthe rotisserie chicken maker all for\n$19.95?\n\n515\n00:26:00.335 --> 00:26:02.707\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nYeah, and you set it and forget it.\n\n516\n00:26:02.707 --> 00:26:04.058\n[LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n517\n00:26:04.058 --> 00:26:07.629\n&gt;&gt; There's are a lot of options though,\nand since you're working with the exact\n\n518\n00:26:07.629 --> 00:26:09.954\nsame data,\neven though you have separate charts,\n\n519\n00:26:09.954 --> 00:26:12.677\nit just makes sense that you\nwould be able to hook into that.\n\n520\n00:26:12.677 --> 00:26:15.615\nI'm just playing around with this,\njust connect over here instead of here.\n\n521\n00:26:15.615 --> 00:26:16.885\n&gt;&gt; And if you think about this,\n\n522\n00:26:16.885 --> 00:26:19.880\nright now what we're doing is we're\nputting it on the same chart.\n\n523\n00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.400\nThis is why people keep\ntalking about dashboards.\n\n524\n00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.165\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We've been mentioning this a little\n\n525\n00:26:24.165 --> 00:26:29.170\nbit cuz think about this, you just take\nthis, just put it on it's own worksheet.\n\n526\n00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:31.960\nGo ahead and\nmake a new worksheet name it dashboard or\n\n527\n00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:36.400\nwhatever, come back over here,\ncome over here to format, no design?\n\n528\n00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:41.910\nYeah design, move the chart,\nput it in as an object in your sheet one.\n\n529\n00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:43.020\nAnd then that gets moved over.\n\n530\n00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:45.310\nYou move,\nyou bring your slicers over, as well.\n\n531\n00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:46.210\nWhere did it go?\n\n532\n00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:47.998\nIt's somewhere, there it is, [LAUGH] okay.\n\n533\n00:26:47.998 --> 00:26:48.925\nWe go ahead and start doing it.\n\n534\n00:26:48.925 --> 00:26:52.614\nAnd so all you're doing is\nputting all of your charts and\n\n535\n00:26:52.614 --> 00:26:56.240\nthings on one sheet, and\nthen you have those slicers.\n\n536\n00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:59.890\nYou come back over, change your\nsource data, do some refresh, and\n\n537\n00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:01.370\npoof, it's awesome.\n\n538\n00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:03.090\n&gt;&gt; It's a magic wand, that's for sure.\n\n539\n00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:05.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I mean,\npeople make this whole dashboard thing to\n\n540\n00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:06.240\nbe more complicated.\n\n541\n00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:09.600\nIt's really just charts or\npivot tables, pivot charts,\n\n542\n00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.555\npivot tables, regular Regular charts,\nregular tables.\n\n543\n00:27:12.555 --> 00:27:14.795\nAnd then you just go ahead and\nput it all in one sheet,\n\n544\n00:27:14.795 --> 00:27:16.695\nand then make some slices in it.\n\n545\n00:27:16.695 --> 00:27:18.855\nAnd then you've got this\ninteractive dashboard.\n\n546\n00:27:18.855 --> 00:27:20.125\n&gt;&gt; They do all the heavy lifting for you?\n\n547\n00:27:20.125 --> 00:27:21.605\n&gt;&gt; Right yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's super easy.\n\n548\n00:27:21.605 --> 00:27:23.612\n&gt;&gt; I think people complicate it\nmore than what it really is.\n\n549\n00:27:23.612 --> 00:27:24.968\nIt's just charts.\n\n550\n00:27:24.968 --> 00:27:26.422\n&gt;&gt; Because it sounds hard.\n\n551\n00:27:26.422 --> 00:27:27.492\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; It sounds like would be\n\n552\n00:27:27.492 --> 00:27:28.442\nhard to do that.\n\n553\n00:27:28.442 --> 00:27:28.956\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n554\n00:27:28.956 --> 00:27:31.627\nit probably is,\nto program all of this stuff.\n\n555\n00:27:31.627 --> 00:27:32.552\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right?\n\n556\n00:27:32.552 --> 00:27:35.622\n&gt;&gt; But for us to get to reap\nthe benefits of it, it's super simple.\n\n557\n00:27:35.622 --> 00:27:38.956\n&gt;&gt; Yup, so\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully you guys see how fun\n\n558\n00:27:38.956 --> 00:27:40.156\npivot charts can be.\n\n559\n00:27:40.156 --> 00:27:42.206\nIt's just a chart and a pivot table.\n\n560\n00:27:42.206 --> 00:27:43.425\nThat's it.\n&gt;&gt; All right Vonne,\n\n561\n00:27:43.425 --> 00:27:46.696\nwell it was definitely a lot of fun to\nwork with these charts and pivot tables.\n\n562\n00:27:46.696 --> 00:27:49.177\nVery cool stuff for\nus to be putting in our environment.\n\n563\n00:27:49.177 --> 00:27:51.604\nYeah, we'll use those and\nI definitely love that button feature,\n\n564\n00:27:51.604 --> 00:27:52.336\nthat slicer, man.\n\n565\n00:27:52.336 --> 00:27:54.306\nThat sold me on Excel.\n\n566\n00:27:54.306 --> 00:27:55.338\nI gotta be honest with you.\n\n567\n00:27:55.338 --> 00:27:57.116\nWell, thanks for your time and\neffort on this show.\n\n568\n00:27:57.116 --> 00:27:59.456\nWe do appreciate you stopping by,\nand we appreciate our audience for\n\n569\n00:27:59.456 --> 00:28:00.910\njoining us as well.\n\n570\n00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:03.240\nBut unfortunately it's that time for\nus to sign off.\n\n571\n00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.630\nFor OFFICEPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n572\n00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:06.492\n&gt;&gt;
