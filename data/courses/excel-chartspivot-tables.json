another great\nepisode of OfficeProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.377 --> 00:00:18.741\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:18.741 --> 00:00:20.427\nAnd in today's episode, well,\n\n6\n00:00:20.427 --> 00:00:23.691\nwe are starting our new series on\nExcel charts and pivot tables.\n\n7\n00:00:23.691 --> 00:00:27.405\nAnd guess, what joining us in the studio\nis our resident expert on that very topic.\n\n8\n00:00:27.405 --> 00:00:29.540\nOur good friend, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.722\nVonne, we're glad to have\nyou in this new series.\n\n10\n00:00:30.722 --> 00:00:31.950\nIt's gonna be a lot of fun.\n\n11\n00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.393\nHow it's going today?\n\n12\n00:00:33.393 --> 00:00:36.136\n&gt;&gt; It's a great day Here at ITProTV.\n\n13\n00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:38.300\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We do have fun here, don't we?\n\n14\n00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.960\n&gt;&gt; Yes, wait, we're OfficeProTv.\n\n15\n00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:39.777\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n16\n00:00:39.777 --> 00:00:40.490\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n17\n00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:41.503\n&gt;&gt; Same thing.\n&gt;&gt; Well, we've got this here.\n\n18\n00:00:41.503 --> 00:00:42.123\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're all [INAUDIBLE].\n\n19\n00:00:42.123 --> 00:00:44.582\n&gt;&gt; It's all one big family.\n\n20\n00:00:44.582 --> 00:00:47.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, and\nwe're exploring the family of charts and\n\n21\n00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.310\npivot tables in this series.\n\n22\n00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.152\nThis is our first in the series\nthat we're gonna start off with,\n\n23\n00:00:53.152 --> 00:00:55.725\njust some basic foundational knowledge.\n\n24\n00:00:55.725 --> 00:01:00.190\nBecause we really wanna just separate\nout the charts and the pivot tables.\n\n25\n00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.815\nBecause it seems that everybody wants\nto know how to do a pivot table.\n\n26\n00:01:02.815 --> 00:01:04.550\nIt's like, just make a pivot table.\n\n27\n00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.500\nAnd it's like, my gosh,\nit's the scariest thing in the world.\n\n28\n00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.341\nAnd it's actually not that bad,\nonce you break it down.\n\n29\n00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:11.380\nSame with the charts.\n\n30\n00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.007\nIf you really kinda just like,\nlet's talk about the terminology first.\n\n31\n00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:16.807\nWhat is a series?\n\n32\n00:01:16.807 --> 00:01:17.855\nWhat is an axis?\n\n33\n00:01:17.855 --> 00:01:20.562\nWhat is a value label thing?\n\n34\n00:01:20.562 --> 00:01:22.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Hey, guess what?\n\n35\n00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.507\nWe have a PowerPoint, so\nI know what we're talking about, so.\n\n36\n00:01:24.507 --> 00:01:25.406\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n37\n00:01:25.406 --> 00:01:26.950\nI think it's funny you\nbring up the terminology.\n\n38\n00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.240\nI think that is probably\nthe very beginning of the,\n\n39\n00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.850\nyou start getting heart palpitations and\nhesitations about doing Excel.\n\n40\n00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.790\nBecause it's got some strange terminology.\n\n41\n00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.690\nPivot table,\nthat just sounds like math to me.\n\n42\n00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.540\nAnd that makes me have anxiety attacks.\n\n43\n00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's one of those,\nokay, we need a report.\n\n44\n00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.310\nYou need to generate this now,\nand it's like, what?\n\n45\n00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.854\nAnd so it's a lot of, well,\nI know what I would need it to look like.\n\n46\n00:01:54.854 --> 00:01:58.150\nChart needs to look like this, but\nI can't make the numbers do it.\n\n47\n00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.900\nAnd that can be a little\nbit of a struggle.\n\n48\n00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.866\nNow, of course, we're gonna have\nperfect demonstration, where, look,\n\n49\n00:02:02.866 --> 00:02:04.030\neverything works perfectly!\n\n50\n00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.223\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; And in the real world,\n\n51\n00:02:06.223 --> 00:02:10.615\nit really also comes down to,\nis your data set up properly\n\n52\n00:02:10.615 --> 00:02:15.479\nto be able to show the report that\nyour boss wanted two days ago?\n\n53\n00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:18.185\nAnd you're just like,\nI don't know how to do a chart so.\n\n54\n00:02:18.185 --> 00:02:19.239\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna try and\n\n55\n00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.821\njust start from the very beginning.\n\n56\n00:02:20.821 --> 00:02:25.715\nThis is why we have our introduction to\ncharts in the particular topic of this\n\n57\n00:02:25.715 --> 00:02:26.570\nseries.\n\n58\n00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.441\nAnd so we're gonna just start\ngetting familiar with this.\n\n59\n00:02:28.441 --> 00:02:30.640\nSo I do have a PowerPoint ready to go.\n\n60\n00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.239\nIt's called Parts of a Chart, and\n\n61\n00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.447\nthis is something that I've actually\nused in a couple other series.\n\n62\n00:02:35.447 --> 00:02:39.232\nSo if it looks familiar,\nyou've seen it before.\n\n63\n00:02:39.232 --> 00:02:42.905\nSo now this is where, in this particular\nslideshow we're talking about, okay,\n\n64\n00:02:42.905 --> 00:02:45.180\nwell, we could have\na table of information.\n\n65\n00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.920\nNow, of course, in Excel\neverything's in a table, in a sense.\n\n66\n00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.520\nWhat I mean by table is we have\neverything in columns and in rows.\n\n67\n00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.220\nIt is a spreadsheet application,\nto clarify that formatting as a table.\n\n68\n00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.190\nTables in Excel are a little different.\n\n69\n00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.250\nBut if we're using the generic\nterminology, that's what we've got.\n\n70\n00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.580\nSo if we could see, all right, well, it\nlooks like definitely Bishop sleeps more\n\n71\n00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.000\nthan Fuego, and\nthey both seem to play a decent amount.\n\n72\n00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.890\nBut it looks like Bishop's\ngot him won there and\n\n73\n00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.210\nFuego definitely likes to\nmeow more than Bishop.\n\n74\n00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.217\nI'm looking at that.\n\n75\n00:03:18.217 --> 00:03:21.641\nBut wouldn't it be a lot easier\nif we had some graphical\n\n76\n00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:25.737\nrepresentation of our data to say,\nwow, well, then yeah,\n\n77\n00:03:25.737 --> 00:03:29.400\nthe orange bar is much bigger\nthan the blue bar right here?\n\n78\n00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.042\nAnd then which one is the orange?\n\n79\n00:03:31.042 --> 00:03:32.673\nOrange is Bishop, so\n\n80\n00:03:32.673 --> 00:03:37.491\na chart is really just a graphical\nrepresentation of our data.\n\n81\n00:03:37.491 --> 00:03:38.962\nJust like we have have smart art,\n\n82\n00:03:38.962 --> 00:03:41.655\nwhich is a graphical representation\nof our data right here.\n\n83\n00:03:41.655 --> 00:03:44.525\nSo we can visually see what\n\n84\n00:03:44.525 --> 00:03:48.085\nour information is trying\nto tell us right here.\n\n85\n00:03:48.085 --> 00:03:51.855\nSo this is where we have,\nthis is a clustered column chart, and\n\n86\n00:03:51.855 --> 00:03:55.295\nthen you can see that we have\nour series labels on there.\n\n87\n00:03:55.295 --> 00:03:58.544\nWe also have our different value axis and\nwe have our legend.\n\n88\n00:03:58.544 --> 00:04:03.540\nSee, I'm already using that terminology\nif a chart right from the very beginning.\n\n89\n00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.700\nBut what is this doing?\n\n90\n00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.075\nIt is comparing the hours, or\nreally we're comparing Fuego and Bishop to\n\n91\n00:04:10.075 --> 00:04:15.900\neach other in each category of sleeping,\nand eating, playing, and meowing.\n\n92\n00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.320\nSo you could see that along the bottom.\n\n93\n00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.840\nAnd how are we measuring this?\n\n94\n00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.490\nWell, it says hours right over\nthere on the left-hand side and\n\n95\n00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.430\nwe have something at the top that says,\nActivities Hours a Day.\n\n96\n00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.385\nSo all of these things are just going to\nkinda help explain what this information,\n\n97\n00:04:33.385 --> 00:04:36.380\nwell, what we're actually looking at.\n\n98\n00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.107\nSo let's jump into some of that\nterminology that we're going to be using\n\n99\n00:04:40.107 --> 00:04:44.031\nwithin Excel, and really what Excel is\ngoing to be forcing us to use in this.\n\n100\n00:04:44.031 --> 00:04:48.813\nEverywhere where you see the orange,\nthat is known as a data series.\n\n101\n00:04:48.813 --> 00:04:54.240\nIt's a series of information that\nhas different points along the way.\n\n102\n00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.060\nThe 12 hours of sleep that\nBishop does is a point.\n\n103\n00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.860\nThe three hours that he eats,\nthat is in point.\n\n104\n00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.255\nAnd you can see that we're trying to\ncorrelate where that works within this\n\n105\n00:05:05.255 --> 00:05:06.448\ntabular data with.\n\n106\n00:05:06.448 --> 00:05:10.420\nThis is more within PowerPoint.\n\n107\n00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.449\nBut you'll see it when we see\nthe example in Excel, that that column,\n\n108\n00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:18.428\nBishop is a column, Fuego is a column and\nthe activities is a column.\n\n109\n00:05:18.428 --> 00:05:21.187\nAnd in the rows, you have the sleeping and\nthe eating, and so\n\n110\n00:05:21.187 --> 00:05:23.800\nthat's where you have the rows\ngoing across the bottom.\n\n111\n00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.360\nAnd the columns are the different, well,\nin this sense, columns of the chart.\n\n112\n00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.480\nSo we have our value,\naccess, and category access,\n\n113\n00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.250\nbecause those are the categories\nof what we're comparing.\n\n114\n00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.190\nThe sleeping and\nthe eating of Fuego and Bishop, so\n\n115\n00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.050\nthat's what we need to\nhave across the top.\n\n116\n00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.720\nBecause we are working on an x and\na y-axis,\n\n117\n00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.360\nor what they're saying is category\non the bottom, value on the left.\n\n118\n00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.030\nLet's see what's on the next slide, and\nthen all sorts of parts of your chart.\n\n119\n00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.478\nYou have the chart's title, well,\nthat's pretty self-explanatory.\n\n120\n00:06:03.478 --> 00:06:04.688\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's the thing up at the top.\n\n121\n00:06:04.688 --> 00:06:05.766\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n122\n00:06:05.766 --> 00:06:08.395\ntell me more about this\ntitle of which you speak.\n\n123\n00:06:08.395 --> 00:06:11.030\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the title is the title.\n\n124\n00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.685\n&gt;&gt; It's at the top.\n\n125\n00:06:11.685 --> 00:06:12.475\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n126\n00:06:12.475 --> 00:06:14.547\n&gt;&gt; About the thing you're looking at.\n\n127\n00:06:14.547 --> 00:06:16.734\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, yeah, so\n\n128\n00:06:16.734 --> 00:06:18.720\nwe have the title, the legend.\n\n129\n00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.360\nWhat does blue represent?\n\n130\n00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.250\nWhat does orange represent?\n\n131\n00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.440\nAnd that's what I'm looking at.\n\n132\n00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.580\nAnd then, of course, we have an axis\ntitle that this is the activity and\n\n133\n00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.130\nthe axis title here, where we have it.\n\n134\n00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.130\nAnd I'm just kind of emphasizing\nthat the data series,\n\n135\n00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:39.150\nthe grid lines, and all of this is,\nwe're plotting this chart.\n\n136\n00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.423\nSo, this is the plot\narea all around in here,\n\n137\n00:06:42.423 --> 00:06:45.361\nwhich is different than the chart area.\n\n138\n00:06:45.361 --> 00:06:48.581\nThe whole box that everything lives, and\n\n139\n00:06:48.581 --> 00:06:52.450\nall of these are selectable\nitems within a chart.\n\n140\n00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:58.407\nAnd so, knowing what you want to format,\nwell, you gotta know where to click and\n\n141\n00:06:58.407 --> 00:06:59.932\nwhat you want selected.\n\n142\n00:06:59.932 --> 00:07:04.861\nSo we have some nice references\nright here to that terminology.\n\n143\n00:07:04.861 --> 00:07:09.384\nThe thing on the bottom, and I've seen\nthese types of things, I've seen charts\n\n144\n00:07:09.384 --> 00:07:13.724\nthat have this, well, table at the bottom\nthat gives you that information.\n\n145\n00:07:13.724 --> 00:07:14.940\nThis is known as a data table.\n\n146\n00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.704\nBecause while the bars will go ahead and\n\n147\n00:07:17.704 --> 00:07:22.320\nrepresent, I can easily see that\nBishop sleeps more than Fuego.\n\n148\n00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:29.859\nAnd these are all whole numbers, but\nwhat if this was 12.8256 and 8.2584?\n\n149\n00:07:29.859 --> 00:07:35.386\nThat's where you might need to see\nthat information in its entirety,\n\n150\n00:07:35.386 --> 00:07:40.550\nso you can add a data table to make\na little bit more sense out of it.\n\n151\n00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.340\nBut then you could also switch this.\n\n152\n00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:48.403\nNow, this is just another way that\nwe could interpret this data.\n\n153\n00:07:48.403 --> 00:07:53.411\nInstead of in one category\nwe're comparing the sleeping,\n\n154\n00:07:53.411 --> 00:07:57.228\neating and playing,\nnow we have it as Fuego.\n\n155\n00:07:57.228 --> 00:08:01.643\nAnd all the things we're comparing is\nthe amount of sleep, eat, play and meow.\n\n156\n00:08:01.643 --> 00:08:04.905\nSo you could see that it's just It's\nreally just take the information and\n\n157\n00:08:04.905 --> 00:08:06.654\njust flipping it on it's side, okay?\n\n158\n00:08:06.654 --> 00:08:11.632\nSo now you can kind of compare\nCats as the category rather than\n\n159\n00:08:11.632 --> 00:08:14.180\nthe Activity as the category.\n\n160\n00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.696\nAnd I probably should've\nchanged that label right here,\n\n161\n00:08:16.696 --> 00:08:18.710\nthat it's not really\nthat activity anymore.\n\n162\n00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:21.480\nIt would be Cats, so [LAUGH].\n\n163\n00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.961\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But, that's okay.\n\n164\n00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:25.701\nWe'll pretend that didn't happen [LAUGH].\n\n165\n00:08:25.701 --> 00:08:30.130\nWe'll have the line graphs, cuz there's\nall sorts of different types of charts.\n\n166\n00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:31.857\nWe have our clustered column here.\n\n167\n00:08:31.857 --> 00:08:34.830\nAnd then we have a line graph.\n\n168\n00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.870\nGraph and charts,\nthose are kinda used interchangeably.\n\n169\n00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:39.430\nWe don't really call it a line chart.\n\n170\n00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:41.200\nAt least that's not how\nI remember doing this.\n\n171\n00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.070\nCuz I remember having to do this\nin school and put the little dots.\n\n172\n00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:46.526\nAnd then draw all the lines like that.\n\n173\n00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:49.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think they just called it\na line graph where I went to school.\n\n174\n00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:49.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n175\n00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:50.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, graph, chart.\n\n176\n00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:51.506\n&gt;&gt; Chart, same thing.\n\n177\n00:08:51.506 --> 00:08:52.554\n&gt;&gt; Same thing.\n&gt;&gt; Six of one.\n\n178\n00:08:52.554 --> 00:08:54.514\n&gt;&gt; Half dozen or the other\n&gt;&gt; Some other.\n\n179\n00:08:54.514 --> 00:08:55.323\n&gt;&gt; Did I say it right?\n\n180\n00:08:55.323 --> 00:08:55.937\n&gt;&gt; You did, actually [LAUGH].\n\n181\n00:08:55.937 --> 00:08:56.858\n&gt;&gt; Yes [LAUGH]!\n\n182\n00:08:56.858 --> 00:08:58.297\n&gt;&gt; So proud of you.\n\n183\n00:08:58.297 --> 00:08:58.897\n&gt;&gt; Score [LAUGH]!\n\n184\n00:08:58.897 --> 00:09:02.658\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we have different ways,\n\n185\n00:09:02.658 --> 00:09:04.509\nand this has specific style.\n\n186\n00:09:04.509 --> 00:09:09.442\nWe've talked a lot about formatting\ngraphable elements with styles\n\n187\n00:09:09.442 --> 00:09:11.660\nin our Excel advanced series.\n\n188\n00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:16.026\nSo all the same things that you can do\nwith a shape or an image where you can,\n\n189\n00:09:16.026 --> 00:09:18.293\nwell I guess we'll stay with shapes.\n\n190\n00:09:18.293 --> 00:09:22.760\nFills, outlines, the effect where you\ncan put drop shadows, you can put glows.\n\n191\n00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.730\nYou can make anything 3D.\n\n192\n00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:28.020\nAll of that applies,\nbecause this is a graphical element.\n\n193\n00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:33.150\nThis is a piece of art, if we'll call it,\nto go ahead and show the information.\n\n194\n00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:36.739\nThen here's another type of chart\nthat we see a lot of times.\n\n195\n00:09:36.739 --> 00:09:40.080\nThis would be a pie chart, or a pie graph.\n\n196\n00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.526\nAnd this does have some\nstyles applied to it.\n\n197\n00:09:42.526 --> 00:09:44.440\nYou still have a legend.\n\n198\n00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:49.736\nBut when this time what we're doing is\nyou're really only comparing one series,\n\n199\n00:09:49.736 --> 00:09:54.659\none category, that Fuego, where you\ndon't have Fuego and Bishop in here.\n\n200\n00:09:54.659 --> 00:10:00.440\nSo pie charts is just one\nthing that has pieces of it.\n\n201\n00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.664\nSo you could see that we're\nlooking at the activity here.\n\n202\n00:10:02.664 --> 00:10:07.560\nAnd I also have some data labels on\nhere of what is the actual value.\n\n203\n00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.960\nAnd then what percentage\nof the whole that is.\n\n204\n00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:12.700\nAnd guess what?\n\n205\n00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.010\nI didn't calculate that.\n\n206\n00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.191\nI didn't do any of that math.\n\n207\n00:10:15.191 --> 00:10:16.486\nLuckily, Excel does it for me.\n\n208\n00:10:16.486 --> 00:10:19.556\nAll I have to do is check off a little\ncheck box of Use Percentages.\n\n209\n00:10:19.556 --> 00:10:21.360\nLike, yes, no math [LAUGH].\n\n210\n00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.252\nAnd then of course we have\nan exploding pie right here.\n\n211\n00:10:25.252 --> 00:10:28.596\nThat's what it's actually\ncalled the amount of explosion.\n\n212\n00:10:28.596 --> 00:10:30.710\nAnd one little piece right here.\n\n213\n00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:34.570\nAnd so we can see different ways\nthat we can take our data labels.\n\n214\n00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:38.798\nInstead of having them here in\nthe middle with a specific style,\n\n215\n00:10:38.798 --> 00:10:40.688\nwe have them on the outside.\n\n216\n00:10:40.688 --> 00:10:42.658\nAnd then there's also changes\nwhere the legend goes.\n\n217\n00:10:42.658 --> 00:10:47.400\nSo you can see that you can start moving\naround these different components.\n\n218\n00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:51.457\nBut again, knowing that these things\nout here are known as data labels.\n\n219\n00:10:51.457 --> 00:10:53.498\nAnd knowing that this thing\ndown here is a legend.\n\n220\n00:10:53.498 --> 00:10:55.996\nAnd you're just kinda\ngetting that terminology,\n\n221\n00:10:55.996 --> 00:10:58.480\nis going to be really important.\n\n222\n00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.652\nNow the nice thing is that you gonna\nhave a lot of help along the way,\n\n223\n00:11:01.652 --> 00:11:04.614\nwhen you start inserting charts and\nyou start formatting it.\n\n224\n00:11:04.614 --> 00:11:08.976\nAnd we're gonna take a look at finish\nchart in just a second, within Excel,\n\n225\n00:11:08.976 --> 00:11:11.010\nnot just in PowerPoint here.\n\n226\n00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:13.460\nBut I always like to end on, whoo whoo.\n\n227\n00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:15.526\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n228\n00:11:15.526 --> 00:11:18.186\n&gt;&gt; That is a special, special\nbackground you have going on there.\n\n229\n00:11:18.186 --> 00:11:19.894\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, right.\n\n230\n00:11:19.894 --> 00:11:21.122\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The slide changed, and\n\n231\n00:11:21.122 --> 00:11:21.656\nhe went like, whoa!\n\n232\n00:11:21.656 --> 00:11:22.671\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n233\n00:11:22.671 --> 00:11:25.131\n&gt;&gt; And this is to prove a point of well,\n\n234\n00:11:25.131 --> 00:11:30.625\nwhile you have the capability of putting\na picture of Bishop in the background of\n\n235\n00:11:30.625 --> 00:11:35.636\nyour plot area, making some bubbled\ntextures within your data series-\n\n236\n00:11:35.636 --> 00:11:36.947\n&gt;&gt; It may be ill-advised.\n\n237\n00:11:36.947 --> 00:11:38.618\nThat's what I think you're\ntrying to tell us [LAUGH].\n\n238\n00:11:38.618 --> 00:11:43.292\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the whole idea here is to have\na graphical representation of your data.\n\n239\n00:11:43.292 --> 00:11:47.516\nAnd not have people go, I have no\nidea what I'm looking at [LAUGH].\n\n240\n00:11:47.516 --> 00:11:54.966\nYeah, so something more along like this,\nthat was a little clearer information.\n\n241\n00:11:54.966 --> 00:11:57.430\nThat's what we want to\nget the point across.\n\n242\n00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:00.590\nBut I will show you that\nyou can add patterns, and\n\n243\n00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:04.660\ntextures, and gradients, and different\ncolors all over the place, if you want to,\n\n244\n00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.409\nof formatting theses elements.\n\n245\n00:12:06.409 --> 00:12:09.770\nCuz, if you really think about it,\nthis is, it's just a rectangle.\n\n246\n00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:11.850\nYeah, this is a rectangle,\nthat's just a line.\n\n247\n00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:16.671\nThese are graphical elements, and\nof course the data's attached to it.\n\n248\n00:12:16.671 --> 00:12:20.355\nSo just know that even if you can,\nyou might not want to [LAUGH].\n\n249\n00:12:20.355 --> 00:12:21.475\nAll right.\n\n250\n00:12:21.475 --> 00:12:23.203\n&gt;&gt; Just cuz you can doesn't\nmean you should, right Vonne?\n\n251\n00:12:23.203 --> 00:12:24.211\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n252\n00:12:24.211 --> 00:12:28.189\nSo I have an example file\nthat we will look at.\n\n253\n00:12:28.189 --> 00:12:33.000\nAgain, just getting our feet under us and\njust getting familiar with it.\n\n254\n00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.800\nWe're not talking about how\nto insert the chart just yet.\n\n255\n00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.780\nAnd we're not gonna do\nany crazy formattings.\n\n256\n00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:41.990\nIt's really more of,\nokay, so I have a chart.\n\n257\n00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:44.950\nIf I select it, what happens?\n\n258\n00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:48.904\nJust like if I was selecting an image or\nsome type of shape,\n\n259\n00:12:48.904 --> 00:12:52.794\nyou are going to have your\ncontextual tabs up at the tart.\n\n260\n00:12:52.794 --> 00:12:53.337\nAt the tart?\n\n261\n00:12:53.337 --> 00:12:54.835\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Is that what I just said [LAUGH]?\n\n262\n00:12:54.835 --> 00:12:56.121\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it looks like a tart [LAUGH].\n\n263\n00:12:56.121 --> 00:13:00.204\n&gt;&gt; I think I was trying to combine top-\n&gt;&gt; Raspberry or blueberry, maybe?\n\n264\n00:13:00.204 --> 00:13:01.383\n&gt;&gt; Mm, that sounds yummy.\n\n265\n00:13:01.383 --> 00:13:02.431\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n&gt;&gt; I'll have that.\n\n266\n00:13:02.431 --> 00:13:03.874\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n267\n00:13:03.874 --> 00:13:08.340\n&gt;&gt; So [LAUGH] we have the top of\nour ribbon with our chart tools.\n\n268\n00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:11.846\nThat's what I was trying to say,\nit just kind of blended together.\n\n269\n00:13:11.846 --> 00:13:13.780\nWe have a design tab.\n\n270\n00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:18.463\nAnd on this design tab you have\nthe different things that would be more\n\n271\n00:13:18.463 --> 00:13:22.108\nassociated with the design\nof the particular chart.\n\n272\n00:13:22.108 --> 00:13:26.921\nAll of those elements that we were just\ntalking about, like the data labels,\n\n273\n00:13:26.921 --> 00:13:29.750\nthe chart title,\nyou can add them into here.\n\n274\n00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:31.830\nNow notice, some of them are grayed out.\n\n275\n00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:32.800\nAnd that could be,\n\n276\n00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:37.350\nwell I know it is because of the type\nof the chart that we have created here.\n\n277\n00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:41.636\nThis is a pie chart, and so\nthere aren't going to be as many options.\n\n278\n00:13:41.636 --> 00:13:44.926\nLike we can't really put in lines here or\ntrend lines,\n\n279\n00:13:44.926 --> 00:13:49.450\nbecause that's not applicable within\nthis particular type of chart.\n\n280\n00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:53.211\nBut where we put the legend, that's part\nof it, so I could go ahead and see that.\n\n281\n00:13:53.211 --> 00:13:55.432\nAnd let me just scroll\ndown just a little bit so\n\n282\n00:13:55.432 --> 00:13:59.610\nyou can see that the legend is right here,\nso I can go ahead and move it around.\n\n283\n00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:02.690\nRemember I said that it'll help\nyou out a lot along the way.\n\n284\n00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:06.568\nI mean, these are some good\ngraphics right here that say,\n\n285\n00:14:06.568 --> 00:14:09.287\nthe right means it's\ngonna go to the right.\n\n286\n00:14:09.287 --> 00:14:11.127\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hey, imagine that [LAUGH]?\n\n287\n00:14:11.127 --> 00:14:12.647\nSo, and then the left and the bottom.\n\n288\n00:14:12.647 --> 00:14:15.868\nAnd so you also have that\nhover in the live previewing,\n\n289\n00:14:15.868 --> 00:14:17.770\nthat's the hover to discover.\n\n290\n00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:18.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's always nice, right?\n\n291\n00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.404\nThe live preview stuff is where,\nwell, I don't know,\n\n292\n00:14:21.404 --> 00:14:24.531\ncuz back in the day what you had to do,\nyou had to click on it, look at it.\n\n293\n00:14:24.531 --> 00:14:26.565\nAnd go, okay, maybe I like that.\n\n294\n00:14:26.565 --> 00:14:29.000\nCtrl+Z that, go back, do it again.\n\n295\n00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.190\nOkay, look at that.\n\n296\n00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:32.100\nOkay, well hold on,\nhow'd this look, right?\n\n297\n00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:33.500\nIt's a real pain in the butt process.\n\n298\n00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:34.616\nThis makes it easy.\n\n299\n00:14:34.616 --> 00:14:36.248\nYou just hover over it,\nand then you watch it go.\n\n300\n00:14:36.248 --> 00:14:37.014\nThat's nice.\n\n301\n00:14:37.014 --> 00:14:38.186\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that is.\n\n302\n00:14:38.186 --> 00:14:41.984\nAnd once you get the information\nin the chart right,\n\n303\n00:14:41.984 --> 00:14:46.610\nall of the rest of it is gonna, hopefully-\n&gt;&gt; Right, just style, personal preference.\n\n304\n00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:49.002\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it makes it a little easier,\n\n305\n00:14:49.002 --> 00:14:51.914\ncuz they have really beefed\nthis stuff up a lot.\n\n306\n00:14:51.914 --> 00:14:53.948\nAnd then the data labels, now that I know.\n\n307\n00:14:53.948 --> 00:14:57.507\nEven if I didn't know the terminology\nof what is a data label,\n\n308\n00:14:57.507 --> 00:15:01.430\nit shows you those things that\nare gonna be inside, [LAUGH] outside.\n\n309\n00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:02.855\nAnd the hovering, it's a little.\n\n310\n00:15:05.031 --> 00:15:05.823\nWell here, you know what?\n\n311\n00:15:05.823 --> 00:15:06.831\nI'm gonna just take the, whoo, hello!\n\n312\n00:15:06.831 --> 00:15:07.521\n&gt;&gt; No, you're not [LAUGH].\n\n313\n00:15:07.521 --> 00:15:08.263\n&gt;&gt; The Ctrl-Z [LAUGH].\n\n314\n00:15:08.263 --> 00:15:12.771\nI'll just move this over here so you can\nsee when I start adding those different\n\n315\n00:15:12.771 --> 00:15:15.240\nlabels it's going to preview them for me.\n\n316\n00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.920\nThey're a little small right now.\n\n317\n00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.054\nBut that's nice that you\ncould see the difference.\n\n318\n00:15:19.054 --> 00:15:19.966\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty good.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n319\n00:15:19.966 --> 00:15:20.638\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n\n320\n00:15:20.638 --> 00:15:22.768\n&gt;&gt; Right, that was pretty easy,\nwasn't it, yeah [LAUGH]?\n\n321\n00:15:22.768 --> 00:15:23.303\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, super.\n\n322\n00:15:23.303 --> 00:15:27.239\nSo adding the different chart\nelements will help you along here.\n\n323\n00:15:27.239 --> 00:15:30.055\nLet's go ahead and\nselect this one over here.\n\n324\n00:15:30.055 --> 00:15:33.589\nYou also have different ways that\nyou can do your layouts, okay?\n\n325\n00:15:33.589 --> 00:15:35.511\nA lot of pre built stuff.\n\n326\n00:15:35.511 --> 00:15:37.421\nIt's kinda like with the smart art.\n\n327\n00:15:37.421 --> 00:15:40.359\nRemember, once we get it in there,\nyou just go ahead a throw style on it.\n\n328\n00:15:40.359 --> 00:15:42.110\nAnd it's like, you're done, right?\n\n329\n00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:46.371\nSo and this gives me lots of different\noptions and presets if how it can have\n\n330\n00:15:46.371 --> 00:15:49.961\ncertain amount of elements\ncombined into a specific layout.\n\n331\n00:15:49.961 --> 00:15:52.760\nAnd then I can quickly choose that.\n\n332\n00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.570\nWe have our change colors,\nthat's pretty self-explanatory.\n\n333\n00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:58.077\nWhat is this pulling off of?\nIt's pulling off of the theme.\n\n334\n00:15:58.077 --> 00:16:01.140\nI went ahead and picked a theme that\nhad some pinks and purples in it.\n\n335\n00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:02.021\nImagine that.\n\n336\n00:16:02.021 --> 00:16:04.717\nAnd so you can go ahead and change that.\n\n337\n00:16:04.717 --> 00:16:07.950\nAnd then you have your\noverall chart styles to where\n\n338\n00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:12.020\nit's going to format each one\nof these elements individually.\n\n339\n00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.650\nWell, actually not individually,\nthey have the different ones.\n\n340\n00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:18.220\nAnd then it's all part of a group and\nit is a style.\n\n341\n00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:19.038\nSo we can look at that.\n\n342\n00:16:19.038 --> 00:16:22.820\nThat switching, remember we talked\nabout how we were comparing instead\n\n343\n00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:26.950\nof the different categories down at\nthe bottom, we flipped that around.\n\n344\n00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:27.980\nDepending on the chart,\n\n345\n00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:31.630\nit's just a one quick little button\nwhere it just goes ahead and flips.\n\n346\n00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:34.350\nYou would also change the chart type,\nthen you can move it over and\n\n347\n00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:35.620\nyou can also select the data.\n\n348\n00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:44.790\nNow the other thing to watch while I am\non my chart is what's being selected.\n\n349\n00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:49.200\nBecause the Design tab, this is kinda\nlike an all encompassing type of thing,\n\n350\n00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.210\nit's gonna format the entire chart.\n\n351\n00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:56.270\nBut when we're getting over into\nthis Format tab over here, this\n\n352\n00:16:56.270 --> 00:17:01.150\nis where it can start getting a little\nspecific as to what do I have selected.\n\n353\n00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:06.145\nSo, all those things that I told you about\nin a chart where you have a plot area,\n\n354\n00:17:06.145 --> 00:17:10.386\nyou have the grid lines,\nit's all about what you have selected and\n\n355\n00:17:10.386 --> 00:17:14.268\nthat's really anything it's\nnot just particular charts.\n\n356\n00:17:14.268 --> 00:17:17.480\nBut watch when I hover\nover different areas.\n\n357\n00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:22.090\nYou see I hover over and it gives me\nthat tooltip that says plot area.\n\n358\n00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:25.480\nI hover over here, that's my series.\n\n359\n00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.015\nWhat series is it?\n\n360\n00:17:26.015 --> 00:17:27.112\nIt's the Fuego series.\n\n361\n00:17:27.112 --> 00:17:28.488\nWhat point is this?\n\n362\n00:17:28.488 --> 00:17:31.103\nThis is the Eat, that's where I have.\n\n363\n00:17:31.103 --> 00:17:33.290\nAnd my value is 10.\n\n364\n00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:37.052\nLet me scooch on over here and\nlet's move this over a little bit so\n\n365\n00:17:37.052 --> 00:17:39.083\nyou can kinda see it all together.\n\n366\n00:17:39.083 --> 00:17:39.878\nWhoops, hello.\n\n367\n00:17:39.878 --> 00:17:42.520\nLet's move this way over there.\n\n368\n00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:43.680\nWell, nop.\n&gt;&gt; No you're not.\n\n369\n00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:44.610\n&gt;&gt; No we're not, how about we do this?\n\n370\n00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:45.948\nI will scroll down.\n\n371\n00:17:45.948 --> 00:17:46.448\n&gt;&gt; You push it to the back.\n\n372\n00:17:46.448 --> 00:17:48.089\n&gt;&gt; There we go, okay, there.\n\n373\n00:17:48.089 --> 00:17:50.730\nSo we can see it a little closer together.\n\n374\n00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:56.120\nSo when I have this selected,\nif I click on that series,\n\n375\n00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:00.180\nnotice over here in the chart you see how\nyou have some different kinda colored\n\n376\n00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:05.050\nboxes that happen to give you\nan indication that this is the Bishop.\n\n377\n00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:09.110\nSo, again, it's trying to pull it together\nfor you, to know that, okay, well,\n\n378\n00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:12.651\nthen that's that series, if I select this,\nthat's the Fuego series.\n\n379\n00:18:12.651 --> 00:18:16.490\nAnd I also know that I have\nthe entire series selected,\n\n380\n00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:19.333\nbecause I see one, two, three, four.\n\n381\n00:18:19.333 --> 00:18:24.211\nI can see the dots on each one\nof those columns as opposed\n\n382\n00:18:24.211 --> 00:18:27.090\nto selecting this series.\n\n383\n00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:30.820\nIf I hover here and click,\nthat is the plot area.\n\n384\n00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:35.010\nOr if I hover right there,\nthere is my grid line and I click it and\n\n385\n00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:36.700\nthat selects the grid lines.\n\n386\n00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:41.330\nSo really kind of, slowing down,\npaying attention to what am I clicking on,\n\n387\n00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:42.820\nwhat am I hovering over?\n\n388\n00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:47.920\nGiving those tool tips along the way will\nreally kind of let's you know what you\n\n389\n00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:51.530\nare selecting because that's when\nyou come up in this Format tab.\n\n390\n00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:55.986\nThis is where you can start changing\nthe format of that select element.\n\n391\n00:18:55.986 --> 00:19:01.393\nSo if I came into the Fill,\nnotice that I'm changing the plot area.\n\n392\n00:19:01.393 --> 00:19:07.050\nIf I had been selected here,\nthen I would be filling in the chart area.\n\n393\n00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:11.830\nSo many different places and\nusing this Format tab will be able to\n\n394\n00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:13.970\nformat those particular elements\nthat you have selected.\n\n395\n00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:17.663\nAnd then the WordArt styles over\nhere will be how the text looks.\n\n396\n00:19:17.663 --> 00:19:21.661\nNow I have everything selected,\nif I throw this on like, okay,\n\n397\n00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:23.594\nthat's a little hard to read.\n\n398\n00:19:23.594 --> 00:19:28.539\nBut you can see that it is applying\nto everything as opposed to if I\n\n399\n00:19:28.539 --> 00:19:33.390\nhad single selected,\nthe chart title and applied it there.\n\n400\n00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:37.990\nSo just knowing where you're at,\nwhat you've clicked on, what you wanna do.\n\n401\n00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:39.920\nSlow down think about it.\n\n402\n00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:43.010\nAnd then having information that's\nbeautifully formatted such as\n\n403\n00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:45.795\nthis where everything is\nin the right columns and\n\n404\n00:19:45.795 --> 00:19:50.150\nin the right places is\npretty easy in that sense.\n\n405\n00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:52.830\nBut we'll go through some\ndifferent examples of,\n\n406\n00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:56.278\nmaybe it's not as straightforward as this.\n\n407\n00:19:56.278 --> 00:19:59.040\nAnd try and give you different examples\n\n408\n00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.960\nof how you can get your charts to\nbe able to show what you want.\n\n409\n00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:08.350\nBut again, just trying to get a foundation\nright now, just a quick introduction\n\n410\n00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:12.910\nof that terminology, where to click,\nthe different tabs up at the top.\n\n411\n00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:15.392\nAnd then what we're\ngoing to do is jump in,\n\n412\n00:20:15.392 --> 00:20:17.890\nin how to actually\ninsert this information.\n\n413\n00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:20.620\nHow we can change because\nthis is tied together.\n\n414\n00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:25.750\nSo if I change this to 15, well, it's\ngonna change in the chart as well because\n\n415\n00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:30.250\nit's saying that I'm charting\nthis particular range of cells.\n\n416\n00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:32.860\nSo making sure you have\nthe right data in there and\n\n417\n00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.588\nchanging is going to be very important.\n\n418\n00:20:34.588 --> 00:20:37.400\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne, that was a very nice\nprimer on working with charts inside\n\n419\n00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:38.240\nof Excel.\n\n420\n00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.340\nStarting to get our\nfeet wet in that arena.\n\n421\n00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.105\nit's gonna be a lot of fun as we\nmove forward cuz as you can see it\n\n422\n00:20:43.105 --> 00:20:45.250\nwas really cool,\nit gives us great graphics.\n\n423\n00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:48.480\nAnd if you are doing any type of\npresentation, this can help you out a lot\n\n424\n00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:52.165\nto make something very nice that everybody\ncan follow along with very easily.\n\n425\n00:20:52.165 --> 00:20:55.090\nVonne, I think you did a great job on this\nepisode, we do appreciate your time and\n\n426\n00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:57.060\neffort that you put into it.\n\n427\n00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:00.080\nI do appreciate our audience out there for\nwatching, but guess what?\n\n428\n00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.930\nWe have run out of time for this episode.\n\n429\n00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:05.160\nSigning off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n430\n00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.396\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n&gt;&gt; And
