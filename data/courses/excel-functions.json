No.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n41\n00:01:33.924 --> 00:01:34.577\n&gt;&gt; You said the horrible word.\n\n42\n00:01:34.577 --> 00:01:35.641\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n\n43\n00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:37.230\n&gt;&gt; Out comes the flop sweat.\n\n44\n00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Because, of course,\nwhen we're talking about Excel functions,\n\n45\n00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.200\nfunctions are really formulas, and\nwe're doing formulas, we're calculating.\n\n46\n00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.603\n&gt;&gt; Are you gonna put\nthe fun back in functions?\n\n47\n00:01:50.603 --> 00:01:51.780\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna try.\n\n48\n00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.394\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n49\n00:01:52.394 --> 00:01:55.737\nI have a PowerPoint presentation that\nwe're gonna start to kinda help us along.\n\n50\n00:01:55.737 --> 00:01:59.758\nSo I didn't do any major themes and\nstuff like this, just-\n\n51\n00:01:59.758 --> 00:02:00.632\n&gt;&gt; Keep it simple, right?\n\n52\n00:02:00.632 --> 00:02:01.414\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n53\n00:02:01.414 --> 00:02:01.914\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n54\n00:02:01.914 --> 00:02:03.160\n&gt;&gt; Wait, this is black on white.\n\n55\n00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.150\nYes, there we go.\n&gt;&gt; Black and white.\n\n56\n00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.610\n&gt;&gt; So we have Calculation Basics,\nall right, ready?\n\n57\n00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.680\n&gt;&gt; Go for it.\n\n58\n00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.945\n&gt;&gt; Do you remember this?\n\n59\n00:02:09.945 --> 00:02:11.735\n&gt;&gt; Please excuse my dear Aunt Sally.\n\n60\n00:02:11.735 --> 00:02:13.358\n&gt;&gt; You know it that way too.\n\n61\n00:02:13.358 --> 00:02:14.027\n&gt;&gt; I do.\nYes, that's how I learned it.\n\n62\n00:02:14.027 --> 00:02:14.907\n&gt;&gt; My gosh, okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n63\n00:02:14.907 --> 00:02:15.518\n&gt;&gt; Must be a Florida thing.\n\n64\n00:02:15.518 --> 00:02:16.420\n&gt;&gt; It totally is.\n\n65\n00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.006\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I've had people in class,\n\n66\n00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:21.505\nI've been teaching Excel for a long time.\n\n67\n00:02:21.505 --> 00:02:23.296\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We always start with this\n\n68\n00:02:23.296 --> 00:02:24.487\nparticular one.\n\n69\n00:02:24.487 --> 00:02:27.061\nI write it on the board,\nand people are like.\n\n70\n00:02:27.061 --> 00:02:28.950\n&gt;&gt; I have a dear Aunt Sally, and\nyou have to excuse her a lot.\n\n71\n00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.998\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, and\nthen every once in awhile somebody,\n\n72\n00:02:32.998 --> 00:02:35.969\nusually around my age,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n73\n00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:38.810\n&gt;&gt; And they would say that's\nPlease Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally.\n\n74\n00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.720\nAnd the other people would go, what?\n\n75\n00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.510\nAnd then I said this is\norders of operations.\n\n76\n00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.050\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And that's where they're like-\n\n77\n00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.360\n&gt;&gt; It's a little pneumonic for\n\n78\n00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.320\nremembering the order of operations.\n\n79\n00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.920\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n80\n00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.470\nAnd that's where it's,\nokay Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally, and\n\n81\n00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.850\nthen it was parentheses, exponents.\n\n82\n00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.090\n&gt;&gt; Multiplication, division.\n\n83\n00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.410\n&gt;&gt; Division and subtraction, yes.\n\n84\n00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.065\nAnd then they're like, yeah, that.\n\n85\n00:03:00.065 --> 00:03:02.774\nSo they never learned the little-\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] That.\n\n86\n00:03:02.774 --> 00:03:06.049\n&gt;&gt; -Dear Aunt Sally thing.\n\n87\n00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:07.500\nAnd that's where I always like,\nwell, where'd you go to school?\n\n88\n00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.320\n&gt;&gt; I thought that was almost universal,\nman.\n\n89\n00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.140\n&gt;&gt; It was like where did you go to school?\n\n90\n00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.280\nWhen did you go to school?\n\n91\n00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.350\nSo I think it was more.\n\n92\n00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.260\n&gt;&gt; Something that came out\nwhen we were in school?\n\n93\n00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.080\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; And it's a Florida thing.\n\n94\n00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.480\nCuz I've had people my same age,\nthat didn't go to school in Florida,\n\n95\n00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.400\nlike we weren't taught that.\n\n96\n00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.046\n&gt;&gt; I don't know what you're talking about.\n\n97\n00:03:25.046 --> 00:03:25.614\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n98\n00:03:25.614 --> 00:03:29.204\nSo that's where I thought this was my\nexperiment and you got it right away.\n\n99\n00:03:29.204 --> 00:03:30.895\n&gt;&gt; And I knew.\n&gt;&gt; I got real excited.\n\n100\n00:03:30.895 --> 00:03:34.870\n[LAUGH] So but yes,\nthis is the whole order of operations.\n\n101\n00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.070\nAnd this is where we said okay, this is\nhow you have to perform calculations.\n\n102\n00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.140\nAnd the whole idea was\nthat multiplication and\n\n103\n00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.410\ndivision and addition and subtraction,\nthey're on the same level.\n\n104\n00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.740\nAnd that was like the whole right to left.\n\n105\n00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.765\nSo, I have some examples,\nso this right here.\n\n106\n00:03:51.765 --> 00:03:53.864\nWe have.\n\n107\n00:03:53.864 --> 00:03:58.971\nIf we did not do the order\noperations we would say okay,\n\n108\n00:03:58.971 --> 00:04:02.301\n8 minus 3 is 5, times 2 is 10,\n\n109\n00:04:02.301 --> 00:04:06.610\nminus 4 is 6 divided by-\n&gt;&gt; Divided by 2 is 3-\n\n110\n00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I'm not good at math in my head.\n\n111\n00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.160\n&gt;&gt; Neither am I don't feel bad\n&gt;&gt; But that's not right.\n\n112\n00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.165\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Because then I have a slide here of\n\n113\n00:04:14.165 --> 00:04:18.764\nthis is where if we did it the wrong way,\nthat's why I have the little numbers, 5,\n\n114\n00:04:18.764 --> 00:04:19.716\n10, 6, 3.\n\n115\n00:04:19.716 --> 00:04:20.680\n&gt;&gt; I assume they're behind your head.\n\n116\n00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.910\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n117\n00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.060\nthe answer's 5 right\nthere off to the right.\n\n118\n00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.040\nI made these slides to where it's\ncentered for me not centered for them.\n\n119\n00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.802\nCuz it's just like my brain wrong side.\n\n120\n00:04:31.802 --> 00:04:33.395\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can't put it over to the left even\n\n121\n00:04:33.395 --> 00:04:35.192\nthough my box is gonna be, [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You will learn.\n\n122\n00:04:35.192 --> 00:04:35.753\n&gt;&gt; I know, right?\n\n123\n00:04:35.753 --> 00:04:40.423\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But the correct answer is 2 because\n\n124\n00:04:40.423 --> 00:04:43.190\nthe whole Please Excuse-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n125\n00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.150\n&gt;&gt; -My Dear, and that's just where when we\nhad our formulas in math class you'd have\n\n126\n00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.658\nto put the PE, do that whole thing and\nthen you put like a little check box,\n\n127\n00:04:50.658 --> 00:04:52.330\nokay there's no parenthesis.\n\n128\n00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.260\nOkay, so Please Excuse,\nthere's no exponents.\n\n129\n00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.700\nThere's, okay division and multiplication.\n\n130\n00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.542\nIn this sense you would underline it,\nright?\n\n131\n00:05:00.542 --> 00:05:02.732\nOkay 3 times 2 and then 4 divided by 2.\n\n132\n00:05:02.732 --> 00:05:06.984\nWe would have to perform those, and\nit really didn't matter which one we did\n\n133\n00:05:06.984 --> 00:05:10.158\nfirst because, but-\n&gt;&gt; Cuz both of ' are kind of broken apart.\n\n134\n00:05:10.158 --> 00:05:10.691\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n135\n00:05:10.691 --> 00:05:11.845\n&gt;&gt; Remember the whole show your\n\n136\n00:05:11.845 --> 00:05:12.790\nwork.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n137\n00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:13.450\n&gt;&gt; Goodness.\n\n138\n00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:14.830\nYeah, all those steps.\n\n139\n00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.479\nAnd so then we'd say now that we're on\nthe addition and subtraction now okay,\n\n140\n00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:21.460\n8 minus 6 minus 2 plus 2 is 2.\n\n141\n00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.020\n&gt;&gt; It's funny Justin at\nDeath Row is a math major and\n\n142\n00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.530\nhe was talking to me about this last week,\nI think.\n\n143\n00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.145\nAnd he said, in math when you do\nmath as like your job the answer is\n\n144\n00:05:32.145 --> 00:05:37.350\nnot what's important it's the formula and\nhow do you prove it?\n\n145\n00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.517\nAnd that's why they put such\nemphasis on show your work.\n\n146\n00:05:39.517 --> 00:05:40.264\n&gt;&gt; Show your work.\n\n147\n00:05:40.264 --> 00:05:43.840\nYes and that was the ones like,\ncuz you wanted to combine multiple steps.\n\n148\n00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.352\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no can't do that.\n&gt;&gt; And they're like no every single line.\n\n149\n00:05:46.352 --> 00:05:47.730\n&gt;&gt; You've gotta prove what you've done.\n\n150\n00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:48.368\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n151\n00:05:48.368 --> 00:05:51.710\nSo we have a fun one, ready?\n\n152\n00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna come to our\n\n153\n00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.160\nfun sky cam view.\n\n154\n00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:54.790\n&gt;&gt; Sky cam?\n\n155\n00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.770\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; In an Excel show?\n\n156\n00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:57.810\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n157\n00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:58.340\n&gt;&gt; My goodness.\n\n158\n00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.035\n&gt;&gt; It's almost like we're a tech show.\n\n159\n00:06:00.035 --> 00:06:02.142\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna throw up.\n\n160\n00:06:02.142 --> 00:06:07.144\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And I have my trusty little\npen with all the different colors on it.\n\n161\n00:06:07.144 --> 00:06:09.424\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; A friend of mine got this from Ireland,\n\n162\n00:06:09.424 --> 00:06:10.276\nfrom Belfast.\n\n163\n00:06:10.276 --> 00:06:11.468\n&gt;&gt; That's cool.\n\n164\n00:06:11.468 --> 00:06:13.380\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\nthis is also talking about middle school.\n\n165\n00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.240\nI figured we'd make a whole\nmiddle school reference.\n\n166\n00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.339\nCuz these pens, and\nI don't know about anybody else.\n\n167\n00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:18.232\n&gt;&gt; I do, we had them when I was a kid.\n\n168\n00:06:18.232 --> 00:06:19.955\n&gt;&gt; My gosh, I had one that had-\n&gt;&gt; Very popular.\n\n169\n00:06:19.955 --> 00:06:21.341\n&gt;&gt; -like 16 colors on it.\n\n170\n00:06:21.341 --> 00:06:22.703\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And they had all,\n\n171\n00:06:22.703 --> 00:06:25.175\nthe thing was like this big,\nit was massive.\n\n172\n00:06:25.175 --> 00:06:26.945\n&gt;&gt; Every color under the rainbow.\n\n173\n00:06:26.945 --> 00:06:29.250\n&gt;&gt; Because we also had back in\nthe day before we had cellphones, so\n\n174\n00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.568\nwe would write notes to each other.\n\n175\n00:06:30.568 --> 00:06:32.560\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; And you always had to write you notes\n\n176\n00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.277\nin at least 15 different colors.\n\n177\n00:06:34.277 --> 00:06:35.763\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, it's how you roll.\n\n178\n00:06:35.763 --> 00:06:37.698\n&gt;&gt; So, [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; So many a girls note, so.\n\n179\n00:06:37.698 --> 00:06:41.890\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we would have to come up here, wow,\n\n180\n00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.660\nokay, Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally.\n\n181\n00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.250\nSo we'd put that across the top, right?\n\n182\n00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:47.580\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; And we'd say, all right, so\n\n183\n00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.160\nwe have to go through and\nparentheses first.\n\n184\n00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.400\nAll right, so let's do the parentheses,\nwe'll make those blue.\n\n185\n00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.070\nSo everything in here, all right?\n\n186\n00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.877\nThere we go.\n&gt;&gt; Is gonna go first.\n\n187\n00:06:55.877 --> 00:06:56.570\n&gt;&gt; Is gonna go first.\n\n188\n00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.390\nBut then there's a parentheses\nwithin the parentheses.\n\n189\n00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:59.460\n&gt;&gt; It's inside of the parentheses.\n\n190\n00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.240\nSo, you've got to do\nthe inside parentheses first.\n\n191\n00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.260\n&gt;&gt; You've got to do that first.\n\n192\n00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.504\nSo, 5 minus 2 is what?\n\n193\n00:07:04.504 --> 00:07:05.437\n&gt;&gt; It's 3.\n&gt;&gt; 3, and\n\n194\n00:07:05.437 --> 00:07:08.070\nwe're gonna combine some steps,\njust because.\n\n195\n00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.350\nAll right so, now we have 3.\n\n196\n00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:10.380\n&gt;&gt; Positive three.\n\n197\n00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.000\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n198\n00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.760\n&gt;&gt; And then we have times 3 plus 7.\n\n199\n00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.690\nI'm going backwards.\n\n200\n00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.600\nOkay, so now we don't do 7 plus 3.\n\n201\n00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.044\nWhat do we do?\n&gt;&gt; We do 3 times 3, which is 9.\n\n202\n00:07:19.044 --> 00:07:21.128\n&gt;&gt; Yes and that's 9.\n\n203\n00:07:21.128 --> 00:07:21.848\n7 + 9 is?\n\n204\n00:07:21.848 --> 00:07:22.352\n&gt;&gt; 16.\n\n205\n00:07:22.352 --> 00:07:26.211\n&gt;&gt; 16, all right, so\nwe've got all of that out of the way, so\n\n206\n00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:31.080\nnow we're gonna go ahead and to\nthe second, times 7 divided by 4 times 2.\n\n207\n00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.400\nAll right, so now and\nthen we do this, remember, right?\n\n208\n00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:34.900\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n\n209\n00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.350\n&gt;&gt; Parenthesis are done,\nso now we do exponents.\n\n210\n00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:38.900\nWhat's 2 to 2?\n\n211\n00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:39.545\n&gt;&gt; 2 to the 2 is 4.\n&gt;&gt; 4,\n\n212\n00:07:39.545 --> 00:07:43.211\nall right, times 7,\nplus 16 divided by, woops that's 4.\n\n213\n00:07:43.211 --> 00:07:44.344\nThis is why I should write in pencil.\n\n214\n00:07:44.344 --> 00:07:46.063\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so now we got exponents.\n\n215\n00:07:46.063 --> 00:07:48.804\nNow we need multiplication and division\nand that's where we have to come in.\n\n216\n00:07:48.804 --> 00:07:55.991\nAll right, so here is 4 times 2, but\nthen there's also 16 divided by 4.\n\n217\n00:07:55.991 --> 00:07:59.032\n&gt;&gt; But PEMDAS says multiplication first.\n\n218\n00:07:59.032 --> 00:08:01.832\nBut remember, multiplication and\ndivision are on the same level.\n\n219\n00:08:01.832 --> 00:08:02.705\n&gt;&gt; They are on the same level.\n\n220\n00:08:02.705 --> 00:08:05.588\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so then it goes left to right.\n\n221\n00:08:05.588 --> 00:08:07.585\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so\nyou do 7 x4 first, right?\n\n222\n00:08:07.585 --> 00:08:10.624\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there's one here too,\nI forgot that one, yes, okay.\n\n223\n00:08:10.624 --> 00:08:12.793\nSee, this is why my handwriting is so\nhorrible and why it's so\n\n224\n00:08:12.793 --> 00:08:13.975\ngood that we have computers now.\n\n225\n00:08:13.975 --> 00:08:15.877\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so 7x4 is?\n\n226\n00:08:15.877 --> 00:08:17.842\n&gt;&gt; 28.\n\n227\n00:08:17.842 --> 00:08:18.342\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; No, right?\n\n228\n00:08:18.342 --> 00:08:19.103\nYeah, 28.\n\n229\n00:08:19.103 --> 00:08:21.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] we're so\n\n230\n00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:25.336\nreliant on calculators though.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know, I told you, I heard math,\n\n231\n00:08:25.336 --> 00:08:29.292\nand I was like, I'm gonna cry.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And so now I changed my colors\n\n232\n00:08:29.292 --> 00:08:33.811\nin the middle, so now 16/4 is-\n&gt;&gt; Is 4.\n\n233\n00:08:33.811 --> 00:08:34.623\n&gt;&gt; 4 x2\n\n234\n00:08:34.623 --> 00:08:35.753\nis?\n&gt;&gt; 8.\n\n235\n00:08:35.753 --> 00:08:38.683\n&gt;&gt; 8+ 28, the answer is?\n\n236\n00:08:38.683 --> 00:08:41.531\n&gt;&gt; 36, right?\n\n237\n00:08:41.531 --> 00:08:44.228\n&gt;&gt; And remember, you have to circle it.\n\n238\n00:08:44.228 --> 00:08:45.288\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right,\n\n239\n00:08:45.288 --> 00:08:46.928\nyou did very well.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n240\n00:08:46.928 --> 00:08:47.517\n&gt;&gt; This was like being in\n\n241\n00:08:47.517 --> 00:08:48.987\nmiddle school again.\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n242\n00:08:48.987 --> 00:08:49.728\n&gt;&gt; I made an F.\n\n243\n00:08:49.728 --> 00:08:50.912\n[LAUGH]\n\n244\n00:08:50.912 --> 00:08:52.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] I got the pen,\n\n245\n00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:54.007\nI got the paper, yes.\n&gt;&gt; You were there.\n\n246\n00:08:54.007 --> 00:08:55.217\nAll you're missing is\n\n247\n00:08:55.217 --> 00:08:56.784\nMadonna bracelets and-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n248\n00:08:56.784 --> 00:08:58.177\na lot of crying.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n249\n00:08:58.177 --> 00:08:59.291\nthat's true.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n250\n00:08:59.291 --> 00:09:00.246\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n251\n00:09:00.246 --> 00:09:02.255\n&gt;&gt; I make it sound like middle school\n\n252\n00:09:02.255 --> 00:09:05.695\nwas the worst thing in the world.\nIt was pretty bad, but I mean,\n\n253\n00:09:05.695 --> 00:09:07.298\n[LAUGH] it's okay.\n&gt;&gt; It wasn't that bad.\n\n254\n00:09:07.298 --> 00:09:10.138\n&gt;&gt; It wasn't that bad, I survived.\n\n255\n00:09:10.138 --> 00:09:12.529\nSo [LAUGH] you can see that this was our\n\n256\n00:09:12.529 --> 00:09:16.346\nformula that we did on the piece of paper.\n&gt;&gt; Now we know what's wrong with you.\n\n257\n00:09:16.346 --> 00:09:17.797\n[LAUGH]\n\n258\n00:09:17.797 --> 00:09:19.454\n&gt;&gt; You got that right, so [LAUGH].\n\n259\n00:09:19.454 --> 00:09:21.566\n&gt;&gt; Badoom shh, thank you, thank you.\n\n260\n00:09:21.566 --> 00:09:22.144\n[LAUGH]\n\n261\n00:09:22.144 --> 00:09:23.589\n&gt;&gt; So I didn't wanna have to try to do\n\n262\n00:09:23.589 --> 00:09:25.977\nthat on the computer, so\nthat's why this guy can't.\n\n263\n00:09:25.977 --> 00:09:26.838\nIt was fun though, right?\n\n264\n00:09:26.838 --> 00:09:27.729\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was fun, it was a good time.\n\n265\n00:09:27.729 --> 00:09:28.462\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not bad.\n\n266\n00:09:28.462 --> 00:09:30.112\n&gt;&gt; So now that we all remember\n\n267\n00:09:30.112 --> 00:09:34.510\nour order of operations,\nhow does that transfer into Excel land?\n\n268\n00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:36.960\n&gt;&gt; Because if you're gonna be\ndoing calculations in Excel,\n\n269\n00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.000\nyou need to follow these rules.\n\n270\n00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.580\nIf I want to add up all of these and\nthen add up all of these, but\n\n271\n00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.480\nthen take the result of this and\ndivide it by this, well then,\n\n272\n00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.310\nyou're gonna have to put parentheses\naround things, aren't you?\n\n273\n00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:55.045\nYeah, so do this first, do this first, and\nthen do what's ever in between it, or so\n\n274\n00:09:55.045 --> 00:09:55.993\non and so forth.\n\n275\n00:09:55.993 --> 00:09:59.120\nSo we're using numbers on\nthis particular example.\n\n276\n00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.950\nAnd actually, let's go back over here to\nmy PowerPoint presentation cuz I just had\n\n277\n00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:03.750\nit on the slide now.\n\n278\n00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:07.000\nIf we were doing this,\nI mean, this is a formula.\n\n279\n00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.396\nThis is where I need to make this result.\n\n280\n00:10:08.396 --> 00:10:09.820\nI have to do this,\nthen this, da, da, da, da.\n\n281\n00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:15.835\nAll right, well,\nthis is the end of the PEMDAS.\n\n282\n00:10:15.835 --> 00:10:19.574\nCuz now, we're getting into how is\nthis correlated into Excel, and\n\n283\n00:10:19.574 --> 00:10:22.380\nlike I just said,\nit works on the same things.\n\n284\n00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:26.510\nSo, what we have here when we\nstart getting into functions and\n\n285\n00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:27.520\nformulas in Excel.\n\n286\n00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:32.920\nWe do have some vocabulary that's gonna\npop up throughout these episodes here.\n\n287\n00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.360\nAnd I just wanted to take this\nmoment to just, well, identify it.\n\n288\n00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.368\nI'm not gonna show you how to do\ncalculations in Excel right now.\n\n289\n00:10:39.368 --> 00:10:41.057\nI'm just showing you the end results, so\n\n290\n00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:43.340\nwe can identify,\nthat's what that thing is.\n\n291\n00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:44.174\nThat's what that is.\n\n292\n00:10:44.174 --> 00:10:45.161\nThat's what that colon means.\n\n293\n00:10:45.161 --> 00:10:47.980\n&gt;&gt; It's a true introduction\ninto functions in Excel.\n\n294\n00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:48.558\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n295\n00:10:48.558 --> 00:10:50.400\n&gt;&gt; Start from scratch.\n\n296\n00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.230\nNobody knows nothing,\n\n297\n00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:54.460\neverybody here is a newborn babe\nwhen it comes to Excel functions.\n\n298\n00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:54.987\nLet's start there.\n\n299\n00:10:54.987 --> 00:10:58.991\n&gt;&gt; And the one thing that we did talk\nabout before this episode was the whole\n\n300\n00:10:58.991 --> 00:11:03.196\nidea of just getting that foundational\nterminology to then not use it right\n\n301\n00:11:03.196 --> 00:11:04.144\nthe whole time.\n\n302\n00:11:04.144 --> 00:11:05.249\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n303\n00:11:05.249 --> 00:11:08.230\nnow that I've told you exactly what\nthat is and the correct terminology,\n\n304\n00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:09.156\nforget I even said it.\n\n305\n00:11:09.156 --> 00:11:10.147\n[LAUGH] I don't say that.\n\n306\n00:11:10.147 --> 00:11:13.963\n&gt;&gt; Because I'm gonna use another\nword that, to me, that's what it is,\n\n307\n00:11:13.963 --> 00:11:16.265\nbut it's not technically right, yeah.\n\n308\n00:11:16.265 --> 00:11:18.195\nSo that's why we're gonna be technical,\nand then we'll-\n\n309\n00:11:18.195 --> 00:11:19.652\n&gt;&gt; We'll have the editors go back in and\n\n310\n00:11:19.652 --> 00:11:20.503\nbe like, function.\n\n311\n00:11:20.503 --> 00:11:23.130\n[LAUGH] Vonne's mouth is\ndoing something different.\n\n312\n00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:27.200\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So your formula's functions cell\n\n313\n00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.670\nreference, now cell reference, we already\nkind of talked about in other episodes.\n\n314\n00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:34.396\nIt's like if we say cell A2,\nthat means the column reference and\n\n315\n00:11:34.396 --> 00:11:37.663\nthe row reference,\nthat's the cell reference, okay?\n\n316\n00:11:37.663 --> 00:11:41.119\nBut then there's something known as\nrelative reference, absolute reference,\n\n317\n00:11:41.119 --> 00:11:42.478\nand there's also name ranges.\n\n318\n00:11:42.478 --> 00:11:44.168\nThese are just basic stuff.\n\n319\n00:11:44.168 --> 00:11:46.767\nThere will be other terms\nthat come out through here,\n\n320\n00:11:46.767 --> 00:11:50.883\nbecause this Excel functions series, this\nshow, this is gonna be a pretty big one.\n\n321\n00:11:50.883 --> 00:11:53.077\nCuz there's gonna be lots of\ndifferent topics in here.\n\n322\n00:11:53.077 --> 00:11:56.904\nYou probably already see that over in the\ncourse library, where it's this episode,\n\n323\n00:11:56.904 --> 00:11:58.790\nit shows our different topics.\n\n324\n00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:00.667\nAnd we're gonna have a reference\nguide with everything.\n\n325\n00:12:00.667 --> 00:12:02.919\nThis is gonna be like\nthe never ending series.\n\n326\n00:12:02.919 --> 00:12:04.257\nWe're just gonna keep\nadding to this forever.\n\n327\n00:12:04.257 --> 00:12:08.288\n&gt;&gt; Two years from now, Excel 2018 just\ncame out, we're gonna scrap all that.\n\n328\n00:12:08.288 --> 00:12:11.043\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's the other thing,\n\n329\n00:12:11.043 --> 00:12:15.618\nis like we're not doing this platform\nspecific or version specific.\n\n330\n00:12:15.618 --> 00:12:17.801\nBecause if you think about-\n&gt;&gt; Math doesn't change.\n\n331\n00:12:17.801 --> 00:12:22.112\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and there's very few changes\nthat happen throughout them with\n\n332\n00:12:22.112 --> 00:12:23.860\nfunctions, specifically.\n\n333\n00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:26.290\nAnd just to start clarifying,\n\n334\n00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:32.010\na function is just a named calculation,\nokay, it has a name.\n\n335\n00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:34.520\nWhich it really is a formula,\nso to me, I'm like, okay,\n\n336\n00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.480\nwhat's the difference between\na formula and a function?\n\n337\n00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.629\nWhy don't we jump over here?\n\n338\n00:12:37.629 --> 00:12:41.864\nLet's go ahead and cancel this cuz that\nwas the end of my PowerPoint presentation,\n\n339\n00:12:41.864 --> 00:12:43.149\nand I have my Excel file.\n\n340\n00:12:43.149 --> 00:12:47.115\nAnd this is just my introduction examples,\nand we have our basics, all right.\n\n341\n00:12:47.115 --> 00:12:49.341\nSo I just have some numbers,\nthey don't mean anything right now.\n\n342\n00:12:49.341 --> 00:12:51.665\nThey're just what we've got here.\n\n343\n00:12:51.665 --> 00:12:57.449\nSo if I have, so let me look at my notes,\nE3, okay, so E3, look at the formula bar.\n\n344\n00:12:57.449 --> 00:12:59.155\nNow remember where the formula bar is,\nright?\n\n345\n00:12:59.155 --> 00:13:00.242\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; The formula bar is up at the top.\n\n346\n00:13:00.242 --> 00:13:01.910\n&gt;&gt; It's up where the formulas go.\n\n347\n00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:03.620\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n348\n00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:07.941\nSo we need to make sure that in the\nformula bar, every time that you're going\n\n349\n00:13:07.941 --> 00:13:12.278\nto perform calculations in Excel,\nit always starts off with an equal sign.\n\n350\n00:13:12.278 --> 00:13:17.518\nSo, see right up there that the cell,\nthe information says 7, right?\n\n351\n00:13:17.518 --> 00:13:22.473\nThat's what we see, but it's a result of\n\n352\n00:13:22.473 --> 00:13:28.002\nadding up C2, this cell right here, + C3.\n\n353\n00:13:28.002 --> 00:13:30.951\nIt really is 3 + 4 is 7, but we didn't-\n&gt;&gt; Last time I checked.\n\n354\n00:13:30.951 --> 00:13:34.862\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] but\nwe didn't code it as 3 + 4, this is-\n\n355\n00:13:34.862 --> 00:13:36.240\n&gt;&gt; Right, you just did the cells.\n\n356\n00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:41.023\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and the =, when you put the =\non the front, it's telling Excel,\n\n357\n00:13:41.023 --> 00:13:43.470\ndo this calculation.\n\n358\n00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:45.400\nI would say this would be a formula.\n\n359\n00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:49.590\nIt is just taking this\ncell plus this cell.\n\n360\n00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:53.321\n&gt;&gt; Right, cuz you haven't given it any\nname, you haven't said this is something\n\n361\n00:13:53.321 --> 00:13:56.563\nthat I want to always be, and\nI just referenced that named function.\n\n362\n00:13:56.563 --> 00:13:58.410\n&gt;&gt; It's not a named function.\n\n363\n00:13:58.410 --> 00:13:59.180\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n364\n00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.164\n&gt;&gt; So that's my clarification.\n\n365\n00:14:01.164 --> 00:14:04.400\n&gt;&gt; So I think of it in program, I do a\nlittle bit of programming, dabble in that.\n\n366\n00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.390\nAnd sometimes you have a little piece of\ncode that you're like, you know what?\n\n367\n00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:10.093\nI can reuse this in a bunch\nof different programs, so\n\n368\n00:14:10.093 --> 00:14:12.249\nyou create a function, and it has a name.\n\n369\n00:14:12.249 --> 00:14:14.436\nAnd all I have to do\nis call that function,\n\n370\n00:14:14.436 --> 00:14:16.445\nand it does whatever's inside of it.\n\n371\n00:14:16.445 --> 00:14:18.994\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] I'm like-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're doing it here.\n\n372\n00:14:18.994 --> 00:14:19.687\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly it.\n\n373\n00:14:19.687 --> 00:14:20.789\n[LAUGH] Yeah, so yeah,\n\n374\n00:14:20.789 --> 00:14:24.600\nyou can totally correlate it into\nother things in computers, perfect.\n\n375\n00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:28.650\nSo if I come here to this cell,\nnow the answer that I see is 27,\n\n376\n00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:31.350\nbut if you look at it, it's saying,\nremember what we talked about,\n\n377\n00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:32.820\nthe Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally?\n\n378\n00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:33.510\n&gt;&gt; Yes, ma'am.\n\n379\n00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:34.693\n&gt;&gt; Here it is in the flesh.\n\n380\n00:14:34.693 --> 00:14:41.063\nWe're saying add up 3 + 4 + 6 + 5,\nwhich is C2.\n\n381\n00:14:41.063 --> 00:14:44.593\nHere, let me zoom out just a little bit,\nso we can kind of move over.\n\n382\n00:14:44.593 --> 00:14:45.600\nHere, let me zoom out.\n\n383\n00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:52.240\nThere we go, so you can see, C2 + that\none, + that, + that are cell references.\n\n384\n00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:57.739\nDo all of that first, and\nthen divide it by B6,\n\n385\n00:14:57.739 --> 00:15:01.599\nwhich is 2, and then times C8.\n\n386\n00:15:01.599 --> 00:15:09.127\nSo 7 + 6 is 11, + 5 is-\n&gt;&gt; You're getting it wrong now.\n\n387\n00:15:09.127 --> 00:15:14.728\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Wait, 3+4 is 7, + 6 is 13,\n\n388\n00:15:14.728 --> 00:15:18.484\n+ 5 is 18, x 2 is 36.\n\n389\n00:15:18.484 --> 00:15:23.511\nNo, divided, 18, 9 x3 is 27 [LAUGH].\n\n390\n00:15:23.511 --> 00:15:25.411\nWow, you can see-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, buddy.\n\n391\n00:15:25.411 --> 00:15:28.048\n&gt;&gt; I'm pretty bad at this in my head,\n[LAUGH] calculator.\n\n392\n00:15:28.048 --> 00:15:29.531\n&gt;&gt; That's what we made them for.\n\n393\n00:15:29.531 --> 00:15:33.600\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly, but I mean,\nthese are just numbers.\n\n394\n00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.560\nBut you can think about this and like this\nis what I want my information to say.\n\n395\n00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.678\nSo these are all formulas now,\nbut look at this one.\n\n396\n00:15:39.678 --> 00:15:47.004\nLook, it's E5, cuz I move my, there we go,\nperfect, I just move that mouse over.\n\n397\n00:15:47.004 --> 00:15:48.254\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's how it works.\n\n398\n00:15:48.254 --> 00:15:48.871\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n399\n00:15:48.871 --> 00:15:52.071\nthis is saying that this is a function.\n\n400\n00:15:52.071 --> 00:15:55.457\nOkay, it still starts off with the equals,\nso it's performing a calculation.\n\n401\n00:15:55.457 --> 00:15:57.980\nBut SUM, hm, what do you think SUM means?\n\n402\n00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:00.914\n&gt;&gt; Last time I checked,\nit's the aggregation of two Numbers,\n\n403\n00:16:00.914 --> 00:16:03.234\nthe [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Whoa, you just went too far for me.\n\n404\n00:16:03.234 --> 00:16:04.232\n[LAUGH] Aggregation, what?\n\n405\n00:16:04.232 --> 00:16:05.313\n&gt;&gt; I can take two numbers.\n\n406\n00:16:05.313 --> 00:16:06.330\nI got a three, I got a five.\n\n407\n00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:08.570\nI put them together I got eight,\nthat's the sum.\n\n408\n00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:10.870\n&gt;&gt; Add, yes, there you go.\n\n409\n00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:12.920\nWe add them together, exactly.\n\n410\n00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.010\nSo now what we have is\nthat's the function name.\n\n411\n00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:18.270\nSo SUM is going to go ahead and\nadd up our numbers.\n\n412\n00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:21.420\nThen the four that you see\nwhat's in parentheses here.\n\n413\n00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:28.440\nYou could see that this is\nopen parentheses C2 colon C5.\n\n414\n00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:32.698\nAlright so you're basically saying\nin the parentheses do that function.\n\n415\n00:16:32.698 --> 00:16:35.940\nAdd up C2 through,\n\n416\n00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:37.110\nthat's what the colon means-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n417\n00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:40.300\n&gt;&gt; The colon means, seat this right there.\n\n418\n00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:41.990\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\nit's some sort of range you give it.\n\n419\n00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:45.360\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yes and so if I actually\ncome into here to start to edit it,\n\n420\n00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:50.450\nyou can see there it is, that's my sum,\nthat's what I want you to add.\n\n421\n00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:53.530\n&gt;&gt; I'm glad you really pointed that out,\nbecause a colon in my brain.\n\n422\n00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:56.300\nAnd says this and this right?\n\n423\n00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:59.930\nAnd not a range a range is\nusually a dash this through this.\n\n424\n00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:01.150\n&gt;&gt; That is interesting.\n\n425\n00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:02.480\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So, that is what\n\n426\n00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.650\nit means in this syntax.\n\n427\n00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:05.300\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; It is funny you say that because it is\n\n428\n00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.810\nalmost like, I know I did not give\nyou any notes for this episode.\n\n429\n00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:08.825\n&gt;&gt; Zero notes.\n\n430\n00:17:08.825 --> 00:17:09.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; For this show.\n\n431\n00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:14.060\n&gt;&gt; Because well look at this one,\nthis one is the result of eight that is\n\n432\n00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:19.040\nadding up C2 and C5, the comma.\n\n433\n00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.530\n&gt;&gt; Okay, the comma makes sense,\n\n434\n00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:25.230\nI totally get that, cuz Excel loves\nthose comma separated values.\n\n435\n00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:26.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So I get that,\n\n436\n00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:29.600\nI've been there enough to go, okay, okay.\n\n437\n00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:33.480\nBut if I see a dash come up, and\nit's not a range, I'm gonna freak out.\n\n438\n00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.123\n&gt;&gt; Yeah!\n[LAUGH] Well, now you know it's a colon.\n\n439\n00:17:36.123 --> 00:17:40.068\nSo there you go, so this is saying C2,\nwhich is three plus C5 which is five,\n\n440\n00:17:40.068 --> 00:17:41.360\nthree plus C5 is eight.\n\n441\n00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.070\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay so there's our result.\n\n442\n00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:49.220\nSo you could see, formula,\njust cells doing some type of calculation,\n\n443\n00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.120\nusing the cell reference.\n\n444\n00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; A function with a named function, and\n\n445\n00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.900\nthe parameters that go\ninto the parenthesis\n\n446\n00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.980\nWhatever is in those parenthesis, do that.\n\n447\n00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:00.980\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nAnd then colon versus like a comma\n\n448\n00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:03.650\nthat you might see from time to time.\n\n449\n00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:08.190\nSo those are some basic\nidentification of what you might see\n\n450\n00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.930\nwhen you're looking at formulas\nwithin the formula bar.\n\n451\n00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:13.910\nLet's come over here.\n\n452\n00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:17.240\nNow, what I have here is the result is 18.\n\n453\n00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.402\nOkay, 18 of, well, what does that mean?\n\n454\n00:18:19.402 --> 00:18:20.964\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Look at the function,\n\n455\n00:18:20.964 --> 00:18:21.927\nout the formula bar.\n\n456\n00:18:21.927 --> 00:18:24.219\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Equal sum, functioning,\n\n457\n00:18:24.219 --> 00:18:26.100\nbasics exclamation point.\n\n458\n00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:29.050\nWhenever you see that,\nthat means the sheet name.\n\n459\n00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:31.220\nLook at the name of\nthe worksheet down here.\n\n460\n00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:36.250\nBasics okay.\nSo it's saying on that worksheet\n\n461\n00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:38.170\ntake the cell range of C2 to C5.\n\n462\n00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:40.490\nIt's just these cells again so right here.\n\n463\n00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:44.980\nHere are my cells and\nthat's what i'm naming so looking\n\n464\n00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:48.870\nthat different syntax exclamation always\ngoing to be referring to sheet names.\n\n465\n00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:52.280\nWhen we get into where you can actually\nperform calculations across multiple work\n\n466\n00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.980\nbooks, multiple files.\n\n467\n00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:55.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Then your file name is in,\n\n468\n00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.740\nI wanna say they're in brackets.\n\n469\n00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:59.250\nAngle brackets.\n\n470\n00:18:59.250 --> 00:18:59.890\nI don't remember.\n\n471\n00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:00.650\n&gt;&gt; It's one of those.\n\n472\n00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:02.060\n&gt;&gt; But they're some types of syntax.\n\n473\n00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:03.071\n&gt;&gt; We'll know by the time we get there.\n\n474\n00:19:03.071 --> 00:19:03.750\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; When you get\n\n475\n00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:05.970\ninto where it's gonna use\nthe name of the file.\n\n476\n00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:08.240\nIt's in brackets, okay or\nsomething along that.\n\n477\n00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:11.440\n&gt;&gt; This is so\nsimilar to a basic programming language.\n\n478\n00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.260\nIt's so funny.\n\n479\n00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:13.420\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; So if you have any programming\n\n480\n00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:16.580\nexperience you're gonna\nbe going man this is,\n\n481\n00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:18.890\nI get it now,\nlet's totally put it together.\n\n482\n00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:20.100\n&gt;&gt; We're telling it to do something.\n\n483\n00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.670\nWe're making it do commands.\n\n484\n00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:25.476\nSo that's where it all comes,\nIt all comes from one source, right?\n\n485\n00:19:25.476 --> 00:19:28.450\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Full circle [INAUDIBLE]\n\n486\n00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:29.470\n&gt;&gt; Full circular.\n\n487\n00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:30.120\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n488\n00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.719\n&gt;&gt; It goes up and\ndown like a carousel [LAUGH]\n\n489\n00:19:31.719 --> 00:19:33.685\n&gt;&gt; Yes [LAUGH], wow okay, no secret.\n\n490\n00:19:33.685 --> 00:19:38.740\n[LAUGH] We're gonna have some name ranges,\nthis is one you would also\n\n491\n00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:42.780\nsee in the [INAUDIBLE] cuz we have a whole\n&gt;&gt; Episode on this,\n\n492\n00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:44.210\nto where look at the result.\n\n493\n00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:50.140\nWe have sum, we know what that is,\nnumber underscore name, what?\n\n494\n00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:53.010\nYeah, that's just,\nif I double-click it, it's just that.\n\n495\n00:19:53.010 --> 00:20:00.130\nBecause what you can do is intstead\nof giving cell references.\n\n496\n00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:02.691\nYou can actually give a cell range a name.\n\n497\n00:20:02.691 --> 00:20:03.240\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n498\n00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.370\n&gt;&gt; Okay and so if you think about this and\n\n499\n00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:08.700\nlook, if I select this,\nthere it is number, underscore, name.\n\n500\n00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.700\nI believe we did this\nin the excel advancer,\n\n501\n00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:14.980\nthere someone else in some of these\nexcel shows, we've done this before, but\n\n502\n00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:21.040\nyou can give it a name and\nif that means something to you.\n\n503\n00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:27.050\n&gt;&gt; You could say some of January\nsales plus February sales,\n\n504\n00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:32.130\nit's not just like C2 through C5 doesn't\nmean as much to me as January sales.\n\n505\n00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:36.090\nSo I'm just giving it like a alias,\nlike a name that I want to use.\n\n506\n00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:38.038\n&gt;&gt; Well we would call a variable.\n\n507\n00:20:38.038 --> 00:20:40.160\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; My gosh, wow you're totally pulling.\n\n508\n00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.070\n&gt;&gt; I told you.\n\n509\n00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:46.370\n&gt;&gt; And I do enough to not know anything,\nto where I'm like I know this too.\n\n510\n00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:47.140\nVery cool.\n\n511\n00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.110\nSo named ranges.\n\n512\n00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:52.270\nAnd then some other concepts that we\nhave over here, relative reference and\n\n513\n00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:54.330\nabsolute reference.\n\n514\n00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:56.330\nThis is when you get into some fun stuff.\n\n515\n00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:57.910\nRemember, we're just demonstrating.\n\n516\n00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:01.460\n&gt;&gt; We have here some sales, right?\n\n517\n00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:03.330\nAnd we have Fuego and\nBishop and everybody here.\n\n518\n00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:04.760\nAnd you can see this is Sales.\n\n519\n00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.280\nThis one we've already done, right?\n\n520\n00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:10.240\nSo take our range of doing this\nfunction on B2 through D2,\n\n521\n00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.650\nso January, February and March, perfect.\n\n522\n00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:17.320\nWell, when I do it once, do you think I\nwent through and did every single one of\n\n523\n00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:20.390\nthese, and if I had fifty rows I'm\nnot doing each one individually.\n\n524\n00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:24.360\n&gt;&gt; That would be a lot of work.\n\n525\n00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.190\n&gt;&gt; That would.\n&gt;&gt; And you're real work adverse!\n\n526\n00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:27.210\n[LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n527\n00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:29.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah here's the thing\nI'm not down with that.\n\n528\n00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:30.490\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n529\n00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:31.640\nRemember the fill handle?\n\n530\n00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:33.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yes filling in series?\n\n531\n00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:34.040\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n532\n00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:37.060\n&gt;&gt; Well the whole idea about\ndoing this when you do it.\n\n533\n00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:39.190\n&gt;&gt; Functions or formulas.\n\n534\n00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:41.260\nIf I take this and drag it down.\n\n535\n00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:43.310\nOne, two, three, it's already done.\n\n536\n00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:48.210\nBut what I'm essentially doing is I'm\nsaying take this first one, copy it down,\n\n537\n00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:50.300\nbut I'm not copying B2 through D2,\n\n538\n00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:57.310\nit will relatively change its\nreference based on the position.\n\n539\n00:21:57.310 --> 00:22:01.190\nSo if I move down one row,\nthe reference has change down.\n\n540\n00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.930\nYou got it, right?\n\n541\n00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:02.620\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n542\n00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:06.010\n&gt;&gt; And then you go down to from where\nyou started, that goes down two.\n\n543\n00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:08.390\nYou go down three, it goes down three.\n\n544\n00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:13.330\nSo as you're filling down,\nit's gonna copy and use\n\n545\n00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:17.880\nthe relative reference so then change the-\n&gt;&gt; I'm vaguely remembering this from\n\n546\n00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:22.800\none of our previous Excel shows in another\nseries where we have to work with that cuz\n\n547\n00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.530\nit was like doing something like,\nit's because it's a relative reference or\n\n548\n00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:27.310\nan absolute-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n549\n00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:28.330\n&gt;&gt; That.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that.\n\n550\n00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:29.260\n&gt;&gt; I remember that, yes.\n\n551\n00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:30.150\n&gt;&gt; It's bringing it back, right?\n\n552\n00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:33.920\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, relative meaning we're relative,\n\n553\n00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.720\nit's moving relative\nto where I'm going and\n\n554\n00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.910\nit doesn't just\n&gt;&gt; You can go across here,\n\n555\n00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:41.870\nbecause the file going to go ahead and\nperform clarifications here, do want drag\n\n556\n00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:48.010\nit over the reference would change,\nit doesn't matter which way you go.\n\n557\n00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:53.680\nBut absolute reference they got wider\nversus absolute, absolute doesn't move.\n\n558\n00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.650\nOkay, so\nif I was doing a commission right?\n\n559\n00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:58.600\nThis is my commission rate of 10%.\n\n560\n00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:05.620\nWell, to find the commission of my sales\nthat would mean take this times this.\n\n561\n00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:06.740\nAnd that's what I get.\n\n562\n00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:08.830\nSo right over here I've got this.\n\n563\n00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:10.960\nWell, now notice here.\n\n564\n00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.060\nI'm already gonna just point it out.\n\n565\n00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:14.890\nLook at that, you see there?\n\n566\n00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:17.750\n&gt;&gt; That is an absolute reference.\n\n567\n00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:21.970\nI am telling it, don't,\nwhen I the whole copy down thing,\n\n568\n00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:27.080\nI don't want this reference\nto change when I copy it.\n\n569\n00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.470\nThis one's relative,\ncuz there's no dollar sign.\n\n570\n00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:32.790\nYou put a dollar sign in front of the row\nreference, a dollar sign in front of\n\n571\n00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:35.315\nthe column reference, or\nwell flip those column then row.\n\n572\n00:23:35.315 --> 00:23:38.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then you're saying don't ever\n\n573\n00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.670\nmove from this position.\n\n574\n00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:41.940\nSo when this gets copied down,\nlet me escape that.\n\n575\n00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:48.880\nSo here's the first one I copied it\nto here, F3 relative, G8 absolute.\n\n576\n00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:56.680\nMove down one more, F4 relative,\nG8 Absolutes, so don't move from here.\n\n577\n00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:03.810\nNow, you can have absolute references on\njust the row or just the column, or both.\n\n578\n00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:05.280\nSo if you think about go ahead and\n\n579\n00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:09.190\nrelatively move the row reference but\nnot the column.\n\n580\n00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:11.978\nWe'll show examples, but\nyou can have it to where.\n\n581\n00:24:11.978 --> 00:24:16.010\nIt's locking down one or the other.\n\n582\n00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:20.590\nAnd then anything else would change\nrelatively to where it goes.\n\n583\n00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:25.830\nSo, that's what we're going to be doing\na lot of throughout all of these episodes,\n\n584\n00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:30.550\nbut again starting at\nthe basics get that foundation\n\n585\n00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:34.091\nIt's in our central topic so\nthis is one of those.\n\n586\n00:24:34.091 --> 00:24:35.180\n[LAUGH] And this is where it's funny,\n\n587\n00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:40.140\nI just created another series in\nCreativePro with video editing.\n\n588\n00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:43.555\nAnd we named this file or\nthis episode, Read Me.\n\n589\n00:24:43.555 --> 00:24:45.900\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That was the title of it.\n\n590\n00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:46.670\n&gt;&gt; That's a good idea.\n\n591\n00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:47.420\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n592\n00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:49.970\n&gt;&gt; You wanna always\nread the read me files.\n\n593\n00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:52.250\nSo don't skip over this introduction.\n\n594\n00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:54.010\nWell if you're watching it, good.\n\n595\n00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:55.305\nGood on you.\n\n596\n00:24:55.305 --> 00:24:57.910\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Tell your friends don't skip over this\n\n597\n00:24:57.910 --> 00:24:58.445\nintroduction.\n\n598\n00:24:58.445 --> 00:24:59.090\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n599\n00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:02.050\nit goes right\n&gt;&gt; Right on back to what we said in\n\n600\n00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:02.630\nthe beginning.\n\n601\n00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:05.760\nIf I would have just read\nthe introduction files.\n\n602\n00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:06.633\n&gt;&gt; But that takes reading!\n\n603\n00:25:06.633 --> 00:25:07.796\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n604\n00:25:07.796 --> 00:25:08.962\n&gt;&gt; Who wants to read?\n\n605\n00:25:08.962 --> 00:25:10.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But again,\nthat's why you have us.\n\n606\n00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:13.810\nSo that is our introduction\nto Excel functions.\n\n607\n00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:15.600\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne, it as very cool,\nand like you said,\n\n608\n00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:19.550\nvery important, crucial for us to\nunderstand, have the same vocabulary.\n\n609\n00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:22.890\nSo then when we're speaking about\nsomething everyone is on the same page,\n\n610\n00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:26.740\nno one is going, what are they talking\nabout, I have no idea what that means.\n\n611\n00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:27.790\nDefining those terms and\n\n612\n00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:31.500\ndefinitions right out of the gate that is\ngoing to help you and help us help you.\n\n613\n00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.620\nSo, good on you Von for\nhelping us do that.\n\n614\n00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:37.590\nGood on you for watching this\nepisode as we said before but\n\n615\n00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:40.870\nit looks like we are at that\npoint in time for us to sign off.\n\n616\n00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:43.190\nWe're Office Pro TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n617\n00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:44.060\n&gt;&gt;

We call that a Vonneage.\n\n32\n00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:37.540\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, I can't tell you how\n\n33\n00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.975\nmany times I've done that and I just,\nI don't know how else to say it, you know?\n\n34\n00:01:41.975 --> 00:01:44.820\n[LAUGH] But well here,\nlet me give you an example.\n\n35\n00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.610\nSo if I have a function called average,\n\n36\n00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.650\nwhat do you think average is going\nto do if I have a group of numbers?\n\n37\n00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.346\n&gt;&gt; Whatever it does it does it\nvery not great but not horrible.\n\n38\n00:01:56.346 --> 00:01:58.117\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's just average, yeah.\n\n39\n00:01:58.117 --> 00:02:01.457\n&gt;&gt; It's average, no,\nit averages things up, right?\n\n40\n00:02:01.457 --> 00:02:04.970\nI've got a string of numbers, I want them\nto get the average of those numbers,\n\n41\n00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.400\nI hit average as a function and\nit does that for me.\n\n42\n00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it adds them all up, sees how\nmany they are, and then divides by that.\n\n43\n00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.540\n&gt;&gt; So function is a standard formula, or\n\n44\n00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.455\ntype of maneuver that you're\ngoing to do inside of Excel.\n\n45\n00:02:19.455 --> 00:02:21.965\nThat you can just say,\nI wanna do that function, it has a name.\n\n46\n00:02:21.965 --> 00:02:24.700\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm\n&gt;&gt; And that name basically says, okay,\n\n47\n00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.015\nthat name does this.\n\n48\n00:02:26.015 --> 00:02:27.280\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah\n&gt;&gt; And it's gonna do that.\n\n49\n00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, like the sum function.\n\n50\n00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.690\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Hm, it's gonna add, yeah, exactly.\n\n51\n00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:33.690\nSo we have a bunch of those, and\n\n52\n00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.932\nthis is just where we're going to just\nlook through some of the functions.\n\n53\n00:02:36.932 --> 00:02:38.750\nThere are some crazy ones in\nhere where I'm just like,\n\n54\n00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:39.880\nI don't even know what means.\n\n55\n00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.246\nBut we're talking about math, right?\n\n56\n00:02:42.246 --> 00:02:44.940\nI mean, it can get pretty crazy in there.\n\n57\n00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.960\nSo why don't we go ahead and jump down\nin here and start this program, Excel.\n\n58\n00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.997\n&gt;&gt; Excel.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n59\n00:02:51.997 --> 00:02:53.720\n&gt;&gt; Is the only one we're using today.\n\n60\n00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.010\n&gt;&gt; Is that what we're doing?\n\n61\n00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.012\nGood.\n[LAUGH] So glad you're here.\n\n62\n00:02:56.012 --> 00:02:58.965\n[LAUGH] So\nwe have our basic functions Excel file and\n\n63\n00:02:58.965 --> 00:03:02.700\nI've got some worksheets in here and\njust some ideas going on.\n\n64\n00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.240\nSo what I wanted to start with is like,\nwell where do we get functions?\n\n65\n00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:13.480\nIt's on the formulas tab, so formulas\nare formulas, but functions are formulas.\n\n66\n00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.430\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n67\n00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.600\n&gt;&gt; They're an alias for a formula.\n\n68\n00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.110\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly,\nit's really all calculations.\n\n69\n00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.840\nSo, I hear people using\nthese interchangeably.\n\n70\n00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.280\nWell we'll go ahead and use the sum\nformula, yeah, we can go with that.\n\n71\n00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So we'll just kinda use function and\n\n72\n00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.110\nformula together, so\nwe've got here the function library.\n\n73\n00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.260\n&gt;&gt; So let me get this straight.\n\n74\n00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.810\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n75\n00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.760\n&gt;&gt; A function is a formula but\na formula is not a function?\n\n76\n00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.490\n&gt;&gt; I would say that.\n\n77\n00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:39.310\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n78\n00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.230\n&gt;&gt; I would use that.\n\n79\n00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.950\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n80\n00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.070\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure somebody else would maybe\nlike to banter with me on that, but\n\n81\n00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:46.130\nyou know what?\n\n82\n00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.154\nWe'll go with it, [LAUGH] we're\ncrunching numbers, all right?\n\n83\n00:03:49.154 --> 00:03:49.754\nWe'll do that.\n\n84\n00:03:49.754 --> 00:03:50.358\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n85\n00:03:50.358 --> 00:03:52.124\nI guess functions can also be used for\na text.\n\n86\n00:03:52.124 --> 00:03:55.180\nOkay, I digress, say stop,\nstop, let's just keep on going.\n\n87\n00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.270\n[LAUGH] Stick to the outline\nright over here.\n\n88\n00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.580\n&gt;&gt; We'll roll up a newspaper\nin about two seconds.\n\n89\n00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.830\n&gt;&gt; So we have different libraries,\nand there's a lot of them,\n\n90\n00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.890\nI think the last I read,\nthere was like 250 named functions?\n\n91\n00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.030\nThere might be more, but\n\n92\n00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.730\nright here we have some different\ncategories of functions.\n\n93\n00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.100\nIf we were going to use some,\nlike I said, text functions.\n\n94\n00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.010\nAll right, add a text function, add a\nlogical function, so what does that mean?\n\n95\n00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.484\nWell, let's look at some of this text,\nokay bahatasa, what?\n\n96\n00:04:27.484 --> 00:04:30.481\nOkay, [LAUGH] I don't even know\nwhat that is, but it's saying,\n\n97\n00:04:30.481 --> 00:04:32.460\nconverts a number to text, okay.\n\n98\n00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.984\nWell then, we also have some ones,\nthis one, this is one of my faves,\n\n99\n00:04:36.984 --> 00:04:38.991\nthe concatenate, or concat.\n\n100\n00:04:38.991 --> 00:04:41.267\nIt takes, what concatenate means what?\n\n101\n00:04:41.267 --> 00:04:43.175\nYou take this, and you put this,\nand you put it together.\n\n102\n00:04:43.175 --> 00:04:43.980\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n103\n00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.640\nwe actually did this in\nthe Excel Essentials.\n\n104\n00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.930\n&gt;&gt; We did.\n&gt;&gt; Remember that flash bill?\n\n105\n00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:48.720\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n106\n00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.259\n&gt;&gt; So amazing, but this is still back\nin the day before that could do that.\n\n107\n00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:55.160\nYou would have to say,\nwell take whatever's in this cell,\n\n108\n00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.010\ngo ahead and add it to this cell,\nlike first and last name.\n\n109\n00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.450\nYou had a first column, you had a last\ncolumn, but you wanted them both together.\n\n110\n00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.231\nYou go ahead and make a function that\ngoes ahead and does that, pretty neat.\n\n111\n00:05:05.231 --> 00:05:05.966\n&gt;&gt; Here it's all ready there.\n\n112\n00:05:05.966 --> 00:05:11.388\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] and then if you look\nat some of these logical statements.\n\n113\n00:05:11.388 --> 00:05:15.160\nAn if statement checks whether\na condition is met and\n\n114\n00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.960\nreturned one value if true and\nanother if false.\n\n115\n00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.830\nThe nice thing is if you\nsee what I'm hovering over,\n\n116\n00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.410\nthis is going to give me\na little description of these.\n\n117\n00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.210\nNow if we go into our math and trig and\n\n118\n00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.960\nwe get into returns the inverse\nhyperbolic cosine of a number.\n\n119\n00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.775\nThat's where I go sure, sounds great.\n\n120\n00:05:34.775 --> 00:05:40.150\n[LAUGH] Obviously there are people\nthat use this function to be able to\n\n121\n00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.800\ncalculate those types of numbers.\n\n122\n00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.690\nThis goes a little over my head,\nI did take trigonometry.\n\n123\n00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:47.507\nDon't really remember,\n\n124\n00:05:47.507 --> 00:05:50.088\nI just remember some like wave things and-\n&gt;&gt; I got what's known as a D in\n\n125\n00:05:50.088 --> 00:05:51.165\ntrigonometry [LAUGH].\n\n126\n00:05:51.165 --> 00:05:55.225\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I did get an A, I don't\nremember anything really about it, but\n\n127\n00:05:55.225 --> 00:05:57.120\nI remember we had to buy a ruler.\n\n128\n00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.428\n&gt;&gt; You people make me sick.\n\n129\n00:05:58.428 --> 00:06:00.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I had a friend like that, man,\n\n130\n00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.230\nthis guy named Mike,\nI went to school with.\n\n131\n00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:03.550\nHe got A's, he was our valedictorian.\n\n132\n00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.780\nHe would call me up and go,\nhow do you do this in Windows Server?\n\n133\n00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.020\nI'm like, dude, you're valedictorian\nof our class, how do you not know this?\n\n134\n00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.660\nHe's like, you know I just do well\non tests and do all my homework.\n\n135\n00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Hey, you know what,\nthat was kind of me too.\n\n136\n00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.915\nI didn't go that far, but I could get it,\nkind of, and then it goes away.\n\n137\n00:06:19.915 --> 00:06:20.970\n[LAUGH] All right, so\n\n138\n00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.900\nnow you can see that we have different\ncategories of functions in here.\n\n139\n00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.203\nAnd if I go into this insert function\ndialog box, you can see it's still got\n\n140\n00:06:30.203 --> 00:06:33.286\nthe same idea, we have our\ndifferent categories of functions.\n\n141\n00:06:33.286 --> 00:06:37.120\nWe have some time and date functions,\nwe have some logical, information,\n\n142\n00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.730\nstatistical.\n\n143\n00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:43.279\nAll right, you can see we that have a nice\nlittle list going here of different ones,\n\n144\n00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:45.680\nand that's where you have so many of them.\n\n145\n00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.010\nAnd the next thing is like,\nwell I don't know,\n\n146\n00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:52.802\nwell what exactly is the returns the,\nI can't even pronounce that word.\n\n147\n00:06:52.802 --> 00:06:55.630\n[LAUGH] And I don't know what this does,\n\n148\n00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.205\nthe nice thing is this has\nhelp on this function.\n\n149\n00:06:58.205 --> 00:07:02.600\nAnd if you click it, it's going to go\nright out into Microsoft Office Help.\n\n150\n00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.727\nIt'll give you some options here, and\n\n151\n00:07:04.727 --> 00:07:07.335\nyou can see it's giving me more\nwords that I don't understand.\n\n152\n00:07:08.335 --> 00:07:09.391\n&gt;&gt; Like description [LAUGH].\n\n153\n00:07:09.391 --> 00:07:13.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, and you see it has\nexamples, and so on and so forth.\n\n154\n00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.230\nNow again, this is where,\nstill doesn't help me, but\n\n155\n00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.400\nthis is more like,\nI don't even understand the concept.\n\n156\n00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But you can get some ideas, but\n\n157\n00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.240\nit is nice that it gives you a nice\nlittle reference guide as to what's\n\n158\n00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.690\ngoing on here with different functions.\n\n159\n00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:30.300\nWe're gonna stay pretty basic,\nwe're gonna keep it easy and\n\n160\n00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:31.620\ndo some different examples.\n\n161\n00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.970\nSo I just wanted to at least\ntake you through the dialog box,\n\n162\n00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:39.901\nknowing that you can get some help on it\nand a reference guide out to Microsoft.\n\n163\n00:07:39.901 --> 00:07:44.650\nAnd then just stick with the ones\nthat are going to work for you.\n\n164\n00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.796\nI'm not a statistician,\nI don't do stuff with trigonometry so\n\n165\n00:07:47.796 --> 00:07:50.720\nI'm going to probably just keep\nin the baby pool over here.\n\n166\n00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.786\nSo we have over here,\nwe talked about adding up numbers in our\n\n167\n00:07:54.786 --> 00:07:59.668\ninserting formulas, or creating\nbasic formulas in our other episode.\n\n168\n00:07:59.668 --> 00:08:05.770\nSo we said add five plus two plus three,\nor B3 plus B4 plus B5.\n\n169\n00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:10.040\nAnd we just did the plus sign\nin between them, totally fine.\n\n170\n00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:14.930\nWell, what we could do is we\ncan insert the SUM function.\n\n171\n00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:17.710\nFunctions and formulas,\nthey all start off with a equals.\n\n172\n00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:20.350\nBut then it puts the function name, and\n\n173\n00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:23.730\nthen in the parentheses it's\ngonna put the parameters.\n\n174\n00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:27.570\nBasically saying, do whatever that\nfunction is on these numbers, and\n\n175\n00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:28.700\nthen it goes ahead and does it.\n\n176\n00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.680\nSo we're going to go\nwalk through the steps.\n\n177\n00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.560\nNow, first step is always\nmake sure you're in the cell\n\n178\n00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.580\nyou want the answer to go in to.\n\n179\n00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.890\nSo that's where I wanna be.\n\n180\n00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.000\nI wanna insert sum function.\n\n181\n00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.830\nOkay, so now I wanna insert that function.\n\n182\n00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:45.955\nHere I know that it is in my most recently\nused because, well, I've done it.\n\n183\n00:08:45.955 --> 00:08:49.315\n[LAUGH] So that's the category that I\nhave, but it would be in our math and\n\n184\n00:08:49.315 --> 00:08:52.080\ntrigonometry and you could search for it.\n\n185\n00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:57.010\nYou could also go ahead and type of brief\ndescription of what you wanna do, add.\n\n186\n00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:02.640\nAnd then it says, it recommends\nme some different functions and\n\n187\n00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.640\nthat's the one I wanna do.\n\n188\n00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.370\nSo I'm gonna click OK.\n\n189\n00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:08.108\nNow what I'm doing is,\nI'm just gonna move this dialog box up,\n\n190\n00:09:08.108 --> 00:09:11.101\nalways checking I'm in\nthe place where I wanna be.\n\n191\n00:09:11.101 --> 00:09:13.570\nAll right, well, what do I wanna add?\n\n192\n00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:17.450\nAnd now you can see that it takes this\ndialog box, and the nice thing if you're\n\n193\n00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:20.890\nkind of curious as to what's going on,\njust follow the steps in the dialogue box.\n\n194\n00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.700\nIt says number one, number two,\n\n195\n00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:26.340\nlogical, okay just go ahead and\nadd some numbers in a range of cells.\n\n196\n00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.000\nSo what's my first number?\n\n197\n00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.330\nWe go ahead and click B3.\n\n198\n00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.080\nNow what's my second number?\n\n199\n00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.920\nYou can, the nice thing about this, and\nyou always gotta be careful about this,\n\n200\n00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:42.140\nis make sure you put your cursor in\nthe field you want to populate, okay.\n\n201\n00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.390\nThat's another big thing.\n\n202\n00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:46.870\nMy second number is B4.\n\n203\n00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.920\nNow this is where I'm like, okay,\nwell now I'm gonna go ahead and do B5.\n\n204\n00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.540\nBut look what just happened.\n\n205\n00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.510\nI didn't move my cursor, right.\n\n206\n00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:00.540\nSo that's where you need to make sure,\nthere's the next field,\n\n207\n00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:04.070\ncursor goes into it, go ahead and\nthen populate from here and you can-\n\n208\n00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:04.960\n&gt;&gt; I like that it does,\n\n209\n00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:10.090\nactually off to the right,\nshow you this is the value of that cell.\n\n210\n00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:12.580\nSo if you look at it and\nyou pay attention there,\n\n211\n00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.230\nyou know that you've got the right one.\n\n212\n00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:15.053\n&gt;&gt; That's awesome.\n\n213\n00:10:15.053 --> 00:10:16.371\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm so glad you pointed that out,\n\n214\n00:10:16.371 --> 00:10:18.110\nbecause that is exactly what I do.\n\n215\n00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:21.990\nIf this isn't showing a result\nthat it makes sense to you,\n\n216\n00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:23.840\nthen something's not going good.\n\n217\n00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.480\nAnd it's nice,\nthere's my formula result, I can see it.\n\n218\n00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.559\nYeah, I'm on track, so I click OK,\nand then there you go.\n\n219\n00:10:29.559 --> 00:10:32.630\nNow, look at what it wrote\nup in our formula bar, okay.\n\n220\n00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:40.700\nThis is something a little different, that\nit wasn't B3+, it's using a comma in here.\n\n221\n00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.490\nNow notice the parentheses,\nthe parenthesis is saying\n\n222\n00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:47.210\nthese are the things that I\nam going to do this function.\n\n223\n00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:52.830\nSo B3 comma, these three cell values or\ncell references, we're gonna add them up.\n\n224\n00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:57.095\nSo the commas mean just these and,\nand, and, and.\n\n225\n00:10:57.095 --> 00:10:59.395\n&gt;&gt; So you're basically feeding those,\nlike you said,\n\n226\n00:10:59.395 --> 00:11:03.105\ncell references into the SUM function,\nand then it knows what to do with it.\n\n227\n00:11:03.105 --> 00:11:04.905\nCuz I'm a SUM, I add things up.\n\n228\n00:11:04.905 --> 00:11:07.945\nI've got whatever's in B3,\nwhatever's in B4, whatever's in B5.\n\n229\n00:11:07.945 --> 00:11:09.915\nI'm gonna roll that around the old noggin,\nadd it up,\n\n230\n00:11:09.915 --> 00:11:11.728\nspit it out for my user out there.\n\n231\n00:11:11.728 --> 00:11:12.537\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; It makes it easy.\n\n232\n00:11:12.537 --> 00:11:15.780\n&gt;&gt; Totally, yes, and\nthat is exactly what it does.\n\n233\n00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:19.412\nNow the other thing that I could have\ndone instead of doing the one number,\n\n234\n00:11:19.412 --> 00:11:22.000\none number, one number here,\nlet's try it again.\n\n235\n00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.450\nI'm gonna take this,\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n236\n00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:25.800\njust use the backspace key\nagain to get rid of that.\n\n237\n00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.050\nLet's do it one more time.\n\n238\n00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:31.030\nWe're going to insert the function,\nwe're gonna insert the sum.\n\n239\n00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:33.212\nAnd then it says you could go ahead and\n\n240\n00:11:33.212 --> 00:11:36.880\nin a range of cells,\nwell what's my first number?\n\n241\n00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:40.740\nWell instead of doing them individually,\nI could take my cursor out here,\n\n242\n00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.930\nmaking a range selection, see there?\n\n243\n00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:46.460\nDon't worry that it sucks it up,\nthat's okay.\n\n244\n00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.200\nWhen you let go of your\nmouse it comes down.\n\n245\n00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:55.042\nIt's writing almost the exact same thing,\nbut I'm representing it in a range.\n\n246\n00:11:55.042 --> 00:11:57.736\nI'm saying B3:B5,\n\n247\n00:11:57.736 --> 00:12:02.860\nthat means everything from B3 through B5.\n\n248\n00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.290\nIt's like saying the same\nthing in a different way.\n\n249\n00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:10.320\nI used the commas before,\nsaying these are the individual numbers.\n\n250\n00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:14.710\nHere I'm saying my first number\nis really a range of cells.\n\n251\n00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:17.520\nAnd then you say, yep,\nthat's exactly what I want, click OK.\n\n252\n00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:21.610\nAnd so you see the same result just\nwritten a little bit differently.\n\n253\n00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:26.770\nSo the colon always means that\nit is a range, all right, cool.\n\n254\n00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:28.070\nSo that's basically what you do.\n\n255\n00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:32.430\nYou say, this is where I want my answer,\ngo ahead and get the right function.\n\n256\n00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:36.007\nGo ahead and get my numbers or\ncells or that I want to do that, and\n\n257\n00:12:36.007 --> 00:12:37.030\nthen that's it.\n\n258\n00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:40.620\nAll right, cool, all right,\nwe're staying basic, here's that average.\n\n259\n00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.270\nRemember we did this in the formulas\nwhere we went ahead and added it,\n\n260\n00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:46.850\nwe used our parentheses, and\ndivided by however many?\n\n261\n00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:51.300\nThis one, all right, well let's go\nahead and find the average function.\n\n262\n00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:55.870\nSo cursor where I want the answer\nto go to, insert the function, and\n\n263\n00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:59.010\njust to show you that if you didn't\nwant to do that button right here.\n\n264\n00:12:59.010 --> 00:12:59.895\nYou see that right there?\n\n265\n00:12:59.895 --> 00:13:03.080\nSame thing, okay, insert function.\n\n266\n00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.400\nI want to, I'm not sure where it's at so\n\n267\n00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:10.790\njust type in the word out,\nwell let's not put a b in there, average.\n\n268\n00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:17.126\nOkay, perfect, that's the one I want,\nreturns the average, the arithmetic mean.\n\n269\n00:13:17.126 --> 00:13:22.292\nYes, that, wasn't that means and\nmodes, and [LAUGH] yep.\n\n270\n00:13:22.292 --> 00:13:25.625\n&gt;&gt; Mm-mm, uh-uh, just keep on going girl.\n\n271\n00:13:25.625 --> 00:13:30.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So we go ahead and\nclick OK, now what is my range?\n\n272\n00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.120\nNow this one's like, okay,\nwell what did it just do?\n\n273\n00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:35.163\nIt says E3 through E8.\n\n274\n00:13:35.163 --> 00:13:37.580\nMm-hm, why is it doing that?\n\n275\n00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:38.545\nIt's just finding numbers.\n\n276\n00:13:38.545 --> 00:13:41.190\n[LAUGH] So sometimes it does that.\n\n277\n00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:45.850\nI specifically moved this over here for\na reason,\n\n278\n00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:50.730\nbecause I didn't want it to be near\nanything to do something like this.\n\n279\n00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:52.420\nIt's saying, I see something out there.\n\n280\n00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:56.440\nI see cells above me, I'll do that.\n\n281\n00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.620\nNo, I don't want you to do that.\n\n282\n00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:02.540\nSo don't be alarmed if it's pulling\nnumbers that it thinks you want it to.\n\n283\n00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:03.960\nIt's really kind of\nlike a proximity thing.\n\n284\n00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.710\nBut the thing is there is no\nnumbers in there, but that's okay.\n\n285\n00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:08.900\nWe're just gonna go ahead and\nbackspace that out.\n\n286\n00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:10.840\nWhat are the numbers\nthat I want to average?\n\n287\n00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.430\nThey're right here, all right, perfect.\n\n288\n00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:16.850\nAnd you can see that it's three point\nthree three three three three, right.\n\n289\n00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:18.410\nAnd then we click OK.\n\n290\n00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:19.480\nYep, there we go.\n\n291\n00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.020\nSo there is my average.\n\n292\n00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:24.620\nThis is where you could go ahead and\ndo your number formatting.\n\n293\n00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:27.430\nRemember back in all of our\nEssentials episodes where,\n\n294\n00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:29.330\nI don't really need that\nmany decimal places.\n\n295\n00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:30.240\nWhoops, wrong one.\n\n296\n00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:34.360\nAnd we'll go ahead and say,\nmaybe I only want one decimal place, or\n\n297\n00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.310\ntwo, so on and so forth.\n\n298\n00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:37.950\nAnd we can go ahead and move on like that.\n\n299\n00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:41.720\nAnd that's how we work with functions.\n\n300\n00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:45.630\nLet's do a few other quick examples,\njust to kind of get you familiar with it.\n\n301\n00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:49.402\nWe'll have whole episodes on time and\ndate function and everything.\n\n302\n00:14:49.402 --> 00:14:53.780\nBut today's date, just to kind of get\nyou familiar with that dialog box.\n\n303\n00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:59.110\nHere is my cursor in or, I've selected\ncell G, I am going to insert,\n\n304\n00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:03.400\nnope we're gonna go to Formulas [LAUGH]\nand we're gonna do a time and date.\n\n305\n00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.198\nNow there is a now and today.\n\n306\n00:15:06.198 --> 00:15:11.270\nI am gonna use today specifically, the\ndifference is today only returns the day,\n\n307\n00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:14.280\nlike the date now would be the date and\nthe time.\n\n308\n00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.970\nAnd that's if you'd use your\n\n309\n00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:21.600\ncell formatting to where you wanted to\nshow the time, today wouldn't do that.\n\n310\n00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.770\nJust go OK.\n\n311\n00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:23.724\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n\n319\n00:15:35.592 --> 00:15:36.179\n&gt;&gt; Just so you know, right?\n\n320\n00:15:36.179 --> 00:15:37.450\n&gt;&gt; As it says here.\n\n321\n00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:38.240\n&gt;&gt; Yes, good.\n\n322\n00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.273\nThank you, Excel for keeping me on track.\n\n323\n00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:41.930\nIt doesn't have anything.\n\n324\n00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:44.290\nIt's just gonna say, well,\nwhatever, it's volatile.\n\n325\n00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:46.660\nOoh, scary.\n\n326\n00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:51.089\nIt's just gonna return today's date,\nwhich is August 8th, 2000 and 2017.\n\n327\n00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:53.360\nThat sounds great.\n\n328\n00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.964\n&gt;&gt; 2000 and 2017, what did I just say?\n\n329\n00:15:54.964 --> 00:15:57.080\n[LAUGH] Okay.\n\n330\n00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.065\n&gt;&gt; That's another Vonne.\n\n331\n00:15:58.065 --> 00:15:58.706\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n332\n00:15:58.706 --> 00:16:01.274\njust you know what just read what's on the\nscreen, not what's coming out of my mouth.\n\n333\n00:16:01.274 --> 00:16:07.004\nAll right, so\nnow the thing is what I had here, just for\n\n334\n00:16:07.004 --> 00:16:12.993\nfun How many days has it been\nsince the start of 2017?\n\n335\n00:16:12.993 --> 00:16:13.678\n&gt;&gt; Seventy-four.\n\n336\n00:16:13.678 --> 00:16:15.030\n&gt;&gt; No, [LAUGH] We're gonna find out.\n\n337\n00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:18.600\n&gt;&gt; But look, I have a starting date,\nI have today's date, and\n\n338\n00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.660\nnow I want to say,\nhow many days are in between?\n\n339\n00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:21.670\nGuess what?\n\n340\n00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:23.660\nThere's a function for that.\n\n341\n00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:28.439\nSo cursor, come over here to my Time and\nDate, it's called days 360.\n\n342\n00:16:28.439 --> 00:16:32.857\nReturns the number of days between\ntwo days based on a 360 day calendar.\n\n343\n00:16:32.857 --> 00:16:35.230\nYou're like, wait, I thought it was 365.\n\n344\n00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:36.989\nJust keep going.\n\n345\n00:16:36.989 --> 00:16:39.117\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And here's the reason they do that,\n\n346\n00:16:39.117 --> 00:16:42.510\nis because that's extremely complex\nmath for the average person.\n\n347\n00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:44.120\nI actually have done that math.\n\n348\n00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:47.160\nIt is not easy because\nyou have leap years,\n\n349\n00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:52.390\nyou actually have 364.4 days,\nor something like that.\n\n350\n00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:54.210\nThere's a bit extra of a day.\n\n351\n00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:57.850\nAnd to make those calculations plus you\nhave some months that are 30 days, some\n\n352\n00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:01.050\nmonths that are 31, and then you've got\nthat one special one in there that's 28,\n\n353\n00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:04.080\nsometimes 29,\ndoesn't know what it wants to do, right.\n\n354\n00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.730\nSo it's very hard to do that math.\n\n355\n00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:07.988\nSo I'm guessing that's\nwhy they want 360 days.\n\n356\n00:17:07.988 --> 00:17:11.530\n&gt;&gt; Weren't you showing me something you\nwrote in some script that you're just\n\n357\n00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:12.794\nlike, it took me 85 days.\n\n358\n00:17:12.794 --> 00:17:14.176\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Wasn't that long.\n\n359\n00:17:14.176 --> 00:17:15.648\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; It was like a day or two.\n\n360\n00:17:15.648 --> 00:17:20.620\n[LAUGH] But it was really hard to figure\nout, okay, there's x amount of days\n\n361\n00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:25.540\nin January, x amount of days in February,\nand this year that equals this.\n\n362\n00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:29.490\nAnd I'm on today so I've gotta add\nthose values together, put this month's\n\n363\n00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:34.850\nvalue into that, and then subtract that\nfrom however many days are in this year.\n\n364\n00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:35.540\nIt's varied-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n365\n00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.360\n&gt;&gt; It's a lot of figuring out.\n\n366\n00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:41.442\nSo the fact that this is in here to\ndo that for you, man, that's nice.\n\n367\n00:17:41.442 --> 00:17:42.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n368\n00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:44.500\nAnd the nice thing is,\nthe demonstration for\n\n369\n00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:47.184\nthis, and I'm glad you're my host,\nas always.\n\n370\n00:17:47.184 --> 00:17:53.180\n[LAUGH] We have date, start,\nwait, start date, end date.\n\n371\n00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:54.170\nFlip them around.\n\n372\n00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:55.750\nBut the nice thing, just follow along.\n\n373\n00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:57.080\nAll right, well where's my start date?\n\n374\n00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.720\nIt is, okay, this one.\n\n375\n00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:00.740\nOkay, where's my end date?\n\n376\n00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:04.120\nMake sure you put your cursor,\nalways put your cursor in the field.\n\n377\n00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.280\nThat's the-\n&gt;&gt; Can you tab to it?\n\n378\n00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.640\nDoes it tab right now?\n\n379\n00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:09.010\n&gt;&gt; You can-\n&gt;&gt; I would be very comfortable.\n\n380\n00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:11.010\n&gt;&gt; You mean with-\n&gt;&gt; Tabbing through it.\n\n381\n00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:11.520\n&gt;&gt; Tab.\n\n382\n00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I thought you said tapping.\n\n383\n00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:14.592\n&gt;&gt; No.\n[LAUGH] Well you tap the tab.\n\n384\n00:18:14.592 --> 00:18:15.240\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n385\n00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.270\n&gt;&gt; Tab completely will work.\n\n386\n00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:22.220\nSo now I have my end date cursor where\nI want, which is the today's date.\n\n387\n00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:25.811\nAnd then you can already see it's been,\nguess what, 217 days.\n\n388\n00:18:25.811 --> 00:18:29.209\n&gt;&gt; I was a little off, just a couple days.\n\n389\n00:18:29.209 --> 00:18:33.350\n&gt;&gt; Now the cool thing is,\nthis is today's date, right?\n\n390\n00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:34.720\nIt's a function.\n\n391\n00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.710\nWhat's gonna happen when we say this and\nopens up tomorrow?\n\n392\n00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:38.500\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna change.\n\n393\n00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:39.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n394\n00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.480\n&gt;&gt; And the next day, and the next day.\n\n395\n00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.240\nCuz it's volatile.\n\n396\n00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.240\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Time keeps on moving.\n\n397\n00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.440\n&gt;&gt; It's changing.\n\n398\n00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:49.650\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and so now I could go have,\nhave like a running total\n\n399\n00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:54.380\nof how many days it's been since\nthe start of January 1, 2017.\n\n400\n00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:57.858\n&gt;&gt; That's why in computers we\nhave what's called NV RAM,\n\n401\n00:18:57.858 --> 00:19:02.080\nnon-volatile RAM versus volatile\nRAM which is changing, right.\n\n402\n00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.830\nSo if you're an IT at all or\n\n403\n00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:06.800\ndone anything with computer,\nthat should make sense to you now.\n\n404\n00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:07.310\n&gt;&gt; That does.\n\n405\n00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:08.790\nBut when you start doing that,\nI'm like, I'm scared.\n\n406\n00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:10.190\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n407\n00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:11.280\n&gt;&gt; You said computers.\n\n408\n00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.230\nYou said math.\n\n409\n00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.930\nSame thing.\n\n410\n00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:16.322\n&gt;&gt; So\nI mean you could have a countdown clock,\n\n411\n00:19:16.322 --> 00:19:20.100\nhow many days until\nthe start of hockey season?\n\n412\n00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.040\nThose kinds of things.\n\n413\n00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:21.670\n&gt;&gt; That's a good countdown.\n\n414\n00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:23.620\n&gt;&gt; Not very far, so I'm very happy.\n\n415\n00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:25.501\nSo we've got those different things.\n\n416\n00:19:25.501 --> 00:19:26.061\n&gt;&gt; It's usually in September is preseason?\n\n417\n00:19:26.061 --> 00:19:27.140\n&gt;&gt; October, yeah.\n\n418\n00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:31.746\nUsually around my birthday is when\nthe first game of the season starts.\n\n419\n00:19:31.746 --> 00:19:32.918\nSo, yay.\n\n420\n00:19:32.918 --> 00:19:37.079\nAll right, [LAUGH] so now the cool thing\nhere is just getting our feet wet on all\n\n421\n00:19:37.079 --> 00:19:39.240\nof this, well on this particular one.\n\n422\n00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:43.740\nI wanna move over into doing\na very basic function which\n\n423\n00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:47.670\nis the sum function,\nadding numbers up, okay.\n\n424\n00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:50.530\nSo you're like, well,\nwe kind of already did this.\n\n425\n00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:53.910\nYeah, but I'm gonna take it\none step further, all right.\n\n426\n00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:55.680\nSo now we have some here.\n\n427\n00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:00.610\nI think these are cat toys that the cats\nhave destroyed each month or something.\n\n428\n00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:02.710\nMaybe we could talk about sales.\n\n429\n00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:04.052\nWell we'll just go with numbers.\n\n430\n00:20:04.052 --> 00:20:06.800\nSo I've got all the cats that I've\never had in my life, all right,\n\n431\n00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.785\nand then we have January, February, March.\n\n432\n00:20:08.785 --> 00:20:11.710\nThese are our quarterly totals\nof whatever these numbers mean.\n\n433\n00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:17.549\nIf I wanted to add up January,\nright, still doing the same thing,\n\n434\n00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:21.215\nselect the cell where I want,\ninsert the function.\n\n435\n00:20:21.215 --> 00:20:26.488\nNow watch what happens here when I do my\nmost recently used, my sum functions.\n\n436\n00:20:26.488 --> 00:20:29.360\nClick okay, look at that.\n\n437\n00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.660\nThat was the one that\nit just found numbers.\n\n438\n00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:32.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Well this\n\n439\n00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.260\nis actually find the right ones,\nit's seeing B2 through B8.\n\n440\n00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:36.720\nYeah, that's cool.\n\n441\n00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:40.345\nIf it's adjacent enough to the numbers\nyou're doing the calculations,\n\n442\n00:20:40.345 --> 00:20:43.675\nit usually goes ahead and\nsees it automatically, which is perfect.\n\n443\n00:20:43.675 --> 00:20:44.206\nThat's exactly-\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n444\n00:20:44.206 --> 00:20:45.682\nyou have a nicely organized sheet here and\n\n445\n00:20:45.682 --> 00:20:49.145\nit's gonna go, I see what you're trying\nto do, let me take care of that for you.\n\n446\n00:20:49.145 --> 00:20:51.635\n&gt;&gt; And I'm also, if you look at where and\nI'm done right here, so\n\n447\n00:20:51.635 --> 00:20:52.615\nI'm gonna click OK.\n\n448\n00:20:52.615 --> 00:20:56.990\nI'm putting the answer directly\nbelow where the numbers live.\n\n449\n00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:59.010\nSo if I did this one.\n\n450\n00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:01.720\nLet's go over here to,\nlet's total up fuego,\n\n451\n00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:05.550\nwe got G2 we'll do the same thing,\ninsert the sum function.\n\n452\n00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:06.830\nWe'll click OK.\n\n453\n00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:11.320\nAnd then you're like\nyeah that's right-ish.\n\n454\n00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:12.010\n&gt;&gt; Sorta.\n\n455\n00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:15.150\n&gt;&gt; It says B2, I'm like,\nyeah, perfect, okay.\n\n456\n00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:20.560\nIt is 11 cuz 5 plus 5 plus 1 is 11,\nbut look at what the reference is.\n\n457\n00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.085\nIt's B2 through F2.\n\n458\n00:21:23.085 --> 00:21:25.300\nWhat if I put a number in here?\n\n459\n00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:26.535\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna change that total.\n\n460\n00:21:26.535 --> 00:21:31.360\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, cuz maybe I've decided that\nthat's the number of squeaky buttons.\n\n461\n00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.765\nSqueaky buttons, what?\n\n462\n00:21:33.765 --> 00:21:37.420\n[LAUGH] Squeaky toys they destroyed or\nwhatever.\n\n463\n00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:38.200\nIt's gonna add that up.\n\n464\n00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n465\n00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:40.455\n&gt;&gt; Why am I doing this?\n\n466\n00:21:40.455 --> 00:21:46.710\nCuz the moral of the story is you only\nwant to have the cells that you're\n\n467\n00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:51.165\nactually wanting in the calculation, you\ndon't really want to include blank cells.\n\n468\n00:21:51.165 --> 00:21:55.160\nNow the thing is we'll never ever\nput a number there and that's fine,\n\n469\n00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.050\nI mean you can let it live.\n\n470\n00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:59.950\nBut to be-\n&gt;&gt; Keep that in mind down the road, right.\n\n471\n00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:01.062\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n472\n00:22:01.062 --> 00:22:04.530\nOkay, and so that's where I\nwould say I need to redo this.\n\n473\n00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:07.346\nOkay, so I would go ahead,\nI would delete that out,\n\n474\n00:22:07.346 --> 00:22:11.890\nthen go into the insert function, we go to\nsum, we click OK, and then we say, nope,\n\n475\n00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:14.880\nI don't want the, look, look at this one.\n\n476\n00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:15.830\nLook what it's doing.\n\n477\n00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:18.140\nBecause I have a number there\nit's the closest one so\n\n478\n00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:19.047\nit's pulling that\n&gt;&gt; Nice\n\n479\n00:22:19.047 --> 00:22:20.504\n&gt;&gt; Nope, we don't want that so\n\n480\n00:22:20.504 --> 00:22:23.210\nwe'll backspace,\nmake sure we clear it out.\n\n481\n00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:29.904\nCome out with my mouse and take my white\nplus sign, select these B2 through D2,\n\n482\n00:22:29.904 --> 00:22:34.230\nyep, that's what I want,\nI click OK, and then there you go.\n\n483\n00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:36.827\nAnd that's how you can go ahead and\nstart doing this.\n\n484\n00:22:36.827 --> 00:22:41.440\nNow Daniel,\nI have something I need to tell you.\n\n485\n00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.355\n&gt;&gt;

We had so much fun-\n&gt;&gt; We did, we did.\n\n27\n00:01:09.047 --> 00:01:11.540\n&gt;&gt; We did, we did.\n&gt;&gt; Talking about functions that we had to\n\n28\n00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.434\ncome back for part two because I was\njust like, we're having so much fun.\n\n29\n00:01:15.434 --> 00:01:17.804\nAnd I just repeated myself again.\n\n30\n00:01:17.804 --> 00:01:18.569\n[LAUGH] But that's okay.\n\n31\n00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:22.549\nWe're gonna continue the fun with\nour functions and move on to, ooh,\n\n32\n00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:23.367\nthe AutoSum.\n\n33\n00:01:23.367 --> 00:01:26.566\nAnd we're gonna talk\nabout relative reference.\n\n34\n00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:28.998\nWe said we'd come back with more magic,\nso I'm ready to-\n\n35\n00:01:28.998 --> 00:01:30.725\n&gt;&gt; You'd better put your top hat on.\n\n36\n00:01:30.725 --> 00:01:31.783\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n37\n00:01:31.783 --> 00:01:33.233\n&gt;&gt; I'm ready to dazzle y'all,\n\n38\n00:01:33.233 --> 00:01:36.490\nso [LAUGH] all right, so why don't\nwe just come on back down in here.\n\n39\n00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.730\nAnd we've got the same\nplace where I left off.\n\n40\n00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.050\nI think we even have the same style.\n\n41\n00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.583\nI don't think I touched anything.\n\n42\n00:01:41.583 --> 00:01:44.230\nSo we had everything going on here.\n\n43\n00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.430\nWe had talked about\nadding up our totals of,\n\n44\n00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.660\nI think we're talking\nabout destroyed cat toys.\n\n45\n00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.900\nI think that's maybe what these\nnumbers are of all the cats that\n\n46\n00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:53.750\nI've had in my life.\n\n47\n00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.023\nSo we have our quarterly,\nwhat are these, sales.\n\n48\n00:01:58.023 --> 00:01:59.358\n&gt;&gt; Or toys that have been chewed up.\n\n49\n00:01:59.358 --> 00:02:01.947\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Numbers, okay, and\n\n50\n00:02:01.947 --> 00:02:06.610\nwe went ahead and did the insert\nsum function and it found it.\n\n51\n00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.436\nAnd then we also talked about not\nhaving the blank cells we parted.\n\n52\n00:02:09.436 --> 00:02:14.740\nAll right, so, we're gonna move on\nto making this a little faster.\n\n53\n00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.762\nOkay, cuz yes, we could go ahead\ndo the insert function and\n\n54\n00:02:17.762 --> 00:02:19.740\ndo the dialog box and everything.\n\n55\n00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.230\nBut for some really basic functions and\n\n56\n00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.380\nreally a lot of like the most widely used,\nI would probably say.\n\n57\n00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.108\nWe have some average.\n\n58\n00:02:28.108 --> 00:02:31.008\nThere's also count min and max.\n\n59\n00:02:31.008 --> 00:02:37.436\nYou see up here at the top of this tab,\nthis ribbon, we have the AutoSum button.\n\n60\n00:02:37.436 --> 00:02:39.960\nNow we've got the big old sigma.\n\n61\n00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.210\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we do.\n&gt;&gt; We do, yes, our Greek letter.\n\n62\n00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.474\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Greek, yes.\n\n63\n00:02:44.474 --> 00:02:45.694\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I almost said Roman,\nI'm like, whoa.\n\n64\n00:02:45.694 --> 00:02:48.325\nI started going down that path and I was\nlike, do I know what I'm talking about?\n\n65\n00:02:48.325 --> 00:02:51.942\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You were never\nin a sorority were you?\n\n66\n00:02:51.942 --> 00:02:54.170\n&gt;&gt; No, I was not.\n\n67\n00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.400\n[LAUGH] So you can see here,\nwe have the drop-down next to it.\n\n68\n00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.280\nSo we have the button and\nwe have the drop-down.\n\n69\n00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.680\nIf I click on this,\nyou can see those are the sum, average,\n\n70\n00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.920\ncount numbers max and min.\n\n71\n00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.420\nMaximum value, minimum value,\nhow many do we have?\n\n72\n00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.140\nAnd then averages them out.\n\n73\n00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.740\nSo when you talk about autoing anything\nit just makes it faster, right?\n\n74\n00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.948\nSo that's what we're going to be doing.\n\n75\n00:03:17.948 --> 00:03:21.874\nIt's just gonna automatically\nput in the function, and\n\n76\n00:03:21.874 --> 00:03:24.669\nthen we go out and select our arguments.\n\n77\n00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:27.380\nI think I was using parameters,\nbut it is arguments.\n\n78\n00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.390\nIt's just the cells that we wanna go\nahead and perform that calculation on.\n\n79\n00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.650\nSo we still need to do our same steps.\n\n80\n00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.250\nSelect the cell that you\nwant the answer to go into.\n\n81\n00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.910\nWe're gonna click the AutoSum button and\nwatch what happens.\n\n82\n00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.370\nIt automatically puts in everything for\nthe function.\n\n83\n00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.630\nPuts in the equals, puts the sum,\nand it actually goes out and\n\n84\n00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.490\ntries to find the numbers for\nyou that you want.\n\n85\n00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.600\nAnd in this case,\nit does a perfect job, doesn't it?\n\n86\n00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.460\n&gt;&gt; Very successful.\n\n87\n00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.156\n&gt;&gt; It's exact cuz it's right\nunderneath all the numbers that I want\n\n88\n00:03:54.156 --> 00:03:55.440\nto perform that calculation.\n\n89\n00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.470\nThat's great, perfect,\nall you gotta do is hit Enter and\n\n90\n00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.980\nyou're like boom, there you go.\n\n91\n00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.868\nSo you skip a couple steps with\nusing the AutoSum function.\n\n92\n00:04:03.868 --> 00:04:05.530\nSo that's pretty cool.\n\n93\n00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.320\nLet's try it again.\n\n94\n00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.668\nWe'll come over here to March,\nselect our cell, click on the AutoSum.\n\n95\n00:04:09.668 --> 00:04:12.788\nIt's perfectly positioned where we want,\nwe go ahead and hit Enter and\n\n96\n00:04:12.788 --> 00:04:15.810\nwe're like yes, worked perfect,\nand we're ready to go.\n\n97\n00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.990\nAwesome, I love it, so much fun.\n\n98\n00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:22.170\nSo we could go ahead and let's try it\nagain over here on our totals for Bishop.\n\n99\n00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.370\nNow we're going across.\n\n100\n00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.710\nNow we have a little bit of a gap,\na little taking over the pond,\n\n101\n00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:28.890\njumping over the pond here.\n\n102\n00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.099\nSo if I select this, it's still gonna go\nahead and find the numbers pretty close,\n\n103\n00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:33.896\nwhich is nice.\n\n104\n00:04:33.896 --> 00:04:38.890\nBut we don't want those blank cells.\n\n105\n00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.069\nSo we need to go out and\nselect the cells that we want to use.\n\n106\n00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:49.528\nI'm using slower language,\ntrying to emphasize the word select.\n\n107\n00:04:49.528 --> 00:04:51.800\nWhy are you saying it like that?\n\n108\n00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.010\nBecause this is where it\ncan throw people off.\n\n109\n00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:00.815\nYou select cells with the white plus sign,\nnot the four-pointed arrow.\n\n110\n00:05:00.815 --> 00:05:03.715\nCuz if I come in here,\nit's already kind of getting the running\n\n111\n00:05:03.715 --> 00:05:07.880\nants around most the stuff that I want,\nbut not everything.\n\n112\n00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.475\nSo I want these cells.\n\n113\n00:05:10.475 --> 00:05:14.560\nClick+Hold+Drag and\nselect these with the white.\n\n114\n00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.414\nIf I had, here, let's try this again\njust to show you what people will do.\n\n115\n00:05:17.414 --> 00:05:21.932\nThey'll get here, they'll go fast,\nand they'll go like this, and\n\n116\n00:05:21.932 --> 00:05:23.840\nstart doing this.\n\n117\n00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.310\nThat's not what I wanted.\n\n118\n00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.450\nBecause if you saw what my mouse cursor\nwas, it was the four-pointed arrow.\n\n119\n00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.440\nThat is not what I wanted to do.\n\n120\n00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.595\nNow if it's like, okay, I just need\nto move it down one, that's fine.\n\n121\n00:05:32.595 --> 00:05:36.550\nI mean, there's a reason why you'd\nwant to, but not for this example.\n\n122\n00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.060\nAnd the problem is like okay,\nno, let's go ahead and set, no,\n\n123\n00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.950\nlet's go ahead and select.\n\n124\n00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.640\nI've already kind of like thrown it off.\n\n125\n00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's the point where\n\n126\n00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:49.210\nif you start moving it and\nyou saw where the other indication was.\n\n127\n00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.620\nWe saw how the running ants stopped and\nbecame solid boxes.\n\n128\n00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.670\nIt's basically saying I'm done, and\nas soon as you click off of it and\n\n129\n00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.760\ntry to go back, this is that whole,\nit's okay, don't worry if you mess it up.\n\n130\n00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:06.560\nYou can always Ctrl+Z or use your Undo\nkey and just go ahead and start over.\n\n131\n00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.790\nSo just be very careful about these steps.\n\n132\n00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.600\nSelect the cell where you\nwant the answer to go.\n\n133\n00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.810\nClick the AutoSum button.\n\n134\n00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:18.310\nUse your white plus sign, your selection,\nto select the cells you want and get it.\n\n135\n00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.890\nNow this where if you're still in\nthe running ants, like wait, no,\n\n136\n00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:21.890\nthose aren't it.\n\n137\n00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.020\nWait, let me try this.\n\n138\n00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.133\nNope, no, no,\n\n139\n00:06:24.133 --> 00:06:29.162\nyou see how I'm okay going right now\ncuz the ants are still running, okay?\n\n140\n00:06:29.162 --> 00:06:31.700\nThese are the cells that I want.\n\n141\n00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:32.810\nI'm good.\n\n142\n00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.410\nTo accept the answer, you just hit Enter.\n\n143\n00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.136\nSo those are like the steps\nthat you need to take.\n\n144\n00:06:37.136 --> 00:06:38.086\nYay!\n\n145\n00:06:38.086 --> 00:06:41.090\nOne more.\n\n146\n00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.272\nI'm in Pumpkin, so I'm in a G4,\nclick the AutoSum button.\n\n147\n00:06:45.272 --> 00:06:46.494\nThat's okay.\n\n148\n00:06:46.494 --> 00:06:49.500\nWhy do you think it did that?\n\n149\n00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.830\n&gt;&gt; Because those numbers\nare very close to it.\n\n150\n00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.873\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah.\nSo it's, yeah, yes!\n\n151\n00:06:53.873 --> 00:06:55.780\nI did it!\n&gt;&gt; I did it.\n\n152\n00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.990\n&gt;&gt; And when we were down here it was fine.\n\n153\n00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.210\nIt went ahead and\nsaw more numbers this way.\n\n154\n00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:02.090\nThese are closer.\n\n155\n00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.040\nThat whole pond I was talking about,\nthere's too much of a gap.\n\n156\n00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.471\nSo it's okay if it doesn't\ngrab the right numbers.\n\n157\n00:07:07.471 --> 00:07:11.339\nWe know the next step is just\nselect the numbers you want.\n\n158\n00:07:11.339 --> 00:07:16.090\nCome out out here and\nthen go ahead and finish it up, great.\n\n159\n00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:19.580\nNow the other thing that you could do.\n\n160\n00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:25.090\nNow I wanted to show you that this is fine\nif you have contiguous ranges of cells.\n\n161\n00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.220\nIt's just gonna go ahead and find it.\n\n162\n00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:34.230\nBut you can use the Enter function and\nthe AutoSum to do multiple ranges, okay?\n\n163\n00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.480\nWe just follow the dialog box for\ndoing the inserts.\n\n164\n00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.450\nSo I wanna total up Fuego and\nSasha's numbers.\n\n165\n00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:42.320\nSo there's where I want my answer.\n\n166\n00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.880\nLet's do the function way first.\n\n167\n00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.990\nWe're going to sum it up.\n\n168\n00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:49.430\nAnd now, what's my first set of numbers?\n\n169\n00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:53.070\nMy first set of numbers, and again,\nit's still typing it in right here.\n\n170\n00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:54.390\nIt would be, okay, Fuego.\n\n171\n00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.854\nFuego is this one.\n\n172\n00:07:55.854 --> 00:08:01.426\nSo my cursor's in number one, and\nthat's B2 through D2, all right?\n\n173\n00:08:01.426 --> 00:08:05.304\nMy second set of numbers, so\nfollowing the dialogue box,\n\n174\n00:08:05.304 --> 00:08:08.167\nCursor into the field that would be Sasha.\n\n175\n00:08:08.167 --> 00:08:10.282\nSasha's numbers are here.\n\n176\n00:08:10.282 --> 00:08:12.600\nWe click there and then there you go.\n\n177\n00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.050\nBut look at the formula.\n\n178\n00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:22.720\nOkay, we know these syntaxes or\nthe syntax here comma means and.\n\n179\n00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.850\nOkay, so you're saying and\nthe colon is through, so\n\n180\n00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:29.940\nB2 through D2 and B6 through D6.\n\n181\n00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.870\nSum it all up and\ngiven the answer which is 24,\n\n182\n00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.260\nyou click OK and then there you go, okay.\n\n183\n00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.320\nNow the dialogue box is nice,\n\n184\n00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.880\nit kinda goes through but the auto\nsum button it's, I really like that.\n\n185\n00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.745\nIt's a lot faster,\nyou can do the same thing.\n\n186\n00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:47.480\nFirst step, answer.\n\n187\n00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.380\nPut in the auto sum woo,\nthat's not what I want.\n\n188\n00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.240\nI want Fuego, so you go ahead and\nselect the first one.\n\n189\n00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:59.340\nBut I also need to select another range or\n\n190\n00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.180\njust cells that are not\nnext to each other.\n\n191\n00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.040\nYou hold your Control key.\n\n192\n00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.870\nSo you just keep using the same\nselection techniques that\n\n193\n00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:07.460\nwe have from other episodes.\n\n194\n00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:08.260\n&gt;&gt; Products, and yeah.\n\n195\n00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we go with Sasha, which is here.\n\n196\n00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.680\nSo hold in my Control key,\nI go ahead and select that.\n\n197\n00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.610\nDoing the color codes,\nperfect there you go.\n\n198\n00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:19.390\nSame result,\nit's just which way do you wanna go?\n\n199\n00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:20.890\nDialogue Box, AutoSum.\n\n200\n00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.150\nI like the AutoSum a little bit more.\n\n201\n00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:24.570\n&gt;&gt; It's always nice to have an option,\nright?\n\n202\n00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:27.530\nBecause like you said,\nI like this or I like that,\n\n203\n00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:32.144\nit's two ways to get the same result, so\npick the one you like, you go with that.\n\n204\n00:09:32.144 --> 00:09:33.794\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so now, more magic.\n\n205\n00:09:33.794 --> 00:09:36.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, right now it's like okay,\n\n206\n00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.140\ndifferent techniques.\n\n207\n00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:41.850\nRelative reference I love\nme some relative reference.\n\n208\n00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:46.470\nSo what is it,\nthe concept is the references are going\n\n209\n00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:50.440\nto change when you move down,\nwhen you copy a function.\n\n210\n00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.140\nBecause we've been doing this.\n\n211\n00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:56.660\nWhen we did the first one for January,\nwe said sum up B2 through B8,\n\n212\n00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:03.460\nwell one column over we're summing\nup C2 through C18, same idea, D2.\n\n213\n00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:07.462\nWe did each one individually,\nwe didn't have to do that.\n\n214\n00:10:07.462 --> 00:10:10.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Because it's really the same\n\n215\n00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.402\nthing, we're copying a function, but\n\n216\n00:10:13.402 --> 00:10:18.445\njust changing the references\nrelatively to where we copy it too.\n\n217\n00:10:18.445 --> 00:10:21.750\nWoo, when we [INAUDIBLE] yeah,\nso we go here.\n\n218\n00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.070\nThis one on pumpkin.\n\n219\n00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:28.149\nWe have the sum of B4 through D4, I'm\ngonna copy, just regular old control C.\n\n220\n00:10:28.149 --> 00:10:29.870\nLet me zoom in a little bit more.\n\n221\n00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:33.620\nOkay, we come over here to here,\nit's not gonna paste in 14,\n\n222\n00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.770\ncuz that's result of the formula.\n\n223\n00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:39.120\nBut watch when I paste it.\n\n224\n00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.600\nIt goes in as 13, why?\n\n225\n00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.400\nCuz 2 plus 5 plus 6 is 13.\n\n226\n00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.310\nLook at the references,\nthat's not B4 through D4.\n\n227\n00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:50.973\nIt's B5 through D5, yeah because why?\n\n228\n00:10:50.973 --> 00:10:54.099\nI've copied it from here,\nI pasted it down one,\n\n229\n00:10:54.099 --> 00:10:57.940\nchanged the relative\nreferences that many spaces.\n\n230\n00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:03.290\nSo, if it moves down,\nif you move down it moves down basically,\n\n231\n00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:08.430\nso that's the whole idea here cuz\nwe're not copying the number,\n\n232\n00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:11.550\nit's the formula or\nfunction that we're copying.\n\n233\n00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:14.630\nIf I had done,\nwe could go ahead and copy this.\n\n234\n00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.734\nNow, if I go one, two,three, right?\n\n235\n00:11:17.734 --> 00:11:21.480\nCome to here, paste it, same idea.\n\n236\n00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.950\nYou went down three rows,\nthe references go down three rows.\n\n237\n00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:30.700\nThat's the whole idea of copying\na function from one place to another.\n\n238\n00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:34.300\nAnd you can even go from worksheet\nto worksheet if you want it,\n\n239\n00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:35.950\nas long as it is in the same place.\n\n240\n00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:38.090\nIt's gonna change relatively,\nit's amazing.\n\n241\n00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:40.560\n&gt;&gt; So if you like what\nyou've done in one function.\n\n242\n00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.290\nAnd you say, you know what,\nI just wanna apply that to this area.\n\n243\n00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:46.950\nJust grab it, copy it, put it there,\nand voila you're off to the races.\n\n244\n00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:49.780\n&gt;&gt; Yes okay, now you do have to\nbe a little careful on that.\n\n245\n00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:53.510\nThis might be a little crazy, but\njust roll with me for a minute.\n\n246\n00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:57.760\nSo I come over here to the Fuego and\nSasha, that was B2 through D2, and\n\n247\n00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.420\nB6 through D6, I'm gonna copy that.\n\n248\n00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:04.060\nOkay, just remember,\nwe're going one two three, three down.\n\n249\n00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.410\nAnd I paste this 95.\n\n250\n00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:11.520\nYes, because what did it do?\n\n251\n00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.693\nRemember this was the original.\n\n252\n00:12:12.693 --> 00:12:17.290\n&gt;&gt;

The tumor is B9.\n\n255\n00:12:26.173 --> 00:12:27.745\n[LAUGH] I'm sorry, I couldn't stop myself.\n\n256\n00:12:27.745 --> 00:12:29.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's not a tumor.\n\n257\n00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:30.475\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt;

I'm sorry.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n265\n00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:48.660\nwe went down you can see that\nit went the reference is down so\n\n266\n00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:53.110\nit's like I'm just gonna copy\nnow this is rare remember this?\n\n267\n00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:57.030\nRemember our good old the paste options,\nor smart options.\n\n268\n00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz this one.\n\n269\n00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.750\n&gt;&gt; You fill it gives a bunch of different\ntypes paste options very cool stuff.\n\n270\n00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:04.624\n&gt;&gt; In this one, if I wanted\nthe exact same thing of Fuego and\n\n271\n00:13:04.624 --> 00:13:06.701\nSasha totals the same thing.\n\n272\n00:13:06.701 --> 00:13:11.230\nRemember, we're not copying the number 24,\nit's the function.\n\n273\n00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:15.764\nDon't do that, just go ahead and\ngive me the, that's not what I want to do.\n\n274\n00:13:15.764 --> 00:13:18.546\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay there we go, I just went ahead and\n\n275\n00:13:18.546 --> 00:13:20.540\ndid an undo anyways.\n\n276\n00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:21.950\nLet's go ahead and try that again.\n\n277\n00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:24.570\nWe'll do here, and\nwe want to go ahead, and\n\n278\n00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.780\nwe can also just paste the value,\nall right?\n\n279\n00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:29.880\nOr we could go ahead and do the formulas.\n\n280\n00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.120\nIt's like nope, that's not what we want,\nwe don't wanna transpose it.\n\n281\n00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:37.080\nWe really just want the number and\nthat would actually be 24, okay.\n\n282\n00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.350\nSo that's something that\nyou gotta think of,\n\n283\n00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:44.180\nI don't want to copy the formula,\nI just want the actual result.\n\n284\n00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:46.880\nAnd that is what I want there.\n\n285\n00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.920\nNow if I wanted to just\nhave the same formula.\n\n286\n00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.530\nI would just redo it.\n\n287\n00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:53.820\nI wouldn't necessarily go ahead and\n\n288\n00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:57.420\nuse the copy here because it's,\nI don't wanna go that too crazy.\n\n289\n00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:00.860\nBut taking it out of its function and\n\n290\n00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:04.400\njust giving it the result, that could\nbe something that you want to do.\n\n291\n00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.960\nNow there's no connection again, so\n\n292\n00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:09.850\nif these numbers change,\nthat number's not going to its hard coded.\n\n293\n00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:12.240\nBut you do have your\noptions with your paste.\n\n294\n00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.865\nOkay, so,\nthe other thing I wanted to show you.\n\n295\n00:14:15.865 --> 00:14:19.360\nCopying, wonderful okay, let's go ahead\nand clear these out just for fun.\n\n296\n00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:24.363\nThis is the first one we've done,\nand we have B2 through D2.\n\n297\n00:14:24.363 --> 00:14:26.480\nAll right,\nsame thing all the way down, right.\n\n298\n00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.520\nWe just want to use a relative reference.\n\n299\n00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:31.140\nWe could copy and paste,\nbut what does this guy do?\n\n300\n00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:34.030\nWhat does the little black\nplus sign do Daniel?\n\n301\n00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:36.420\n&gt;&gt; It increases the size of the cell,\nor moves it.\n\n302\n00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:38.470\nOne of the two, I can't remember.\n\n303\n00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:42.160\n&gt;&gt; It's the fill handle and\nit's main job is to?\n\n304\n00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.780\n&gt;&gt; Fill [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and?\n\n305\n00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:44.713\nCopy [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] Coffee?\n\n306\n00:14:44.713 --> 00:14:46.967\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay I'm not good with that\n\n307\n00:14:46.967 --> 00:14:47.985\nkind of stuff.\n\n308\n00:14:47.985 --> 00:14:49.040\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't put me on the spot.\n\n309\n00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.845\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwhat are you trying to do to me woman?\n\n310\n00:14:50.845 --> 00:14:52.130\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, well,\n\n311\n00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:57.390\ncuz we're going to January, February,\nMarch, April, May, the series.\n\n312\n00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:01.640\nBut then it was like, no, I really just\nwanted to say take the number one or\n\n313\n00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.510\njust the word January and copy it down.\n\n314\n00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:06.230\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n315\n00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:11.770\n&gt;&gt; Yes, cuz that's Phil\nhandles first job was to copy.\n\n316\n00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:17.180\nThe Phil series is a special stuff,\nthat's good.\n\n317\n00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:17.758\n&gt;&gt; Yes ma'am.\n\n318\n00:15:17.758 --> 00:15:19.060\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we'll take this and\n\n319\n00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:20.020\nwe'll copy it down.\n\n320\n00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:23.290\nBut if we're not copying the number 11,\nlook at that.\n\n321\n00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:26.850\n&gt;&gt; It's just doing what it's doing in\nthe first cell with the rest of them.\n\n322\n00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:28.270\n&gt;&gt; And using relative reference,\n\n323\n00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.460\nit's changing the references\nwithin the formula.\n\n324\n00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:33.640\nBecause it is copying the function, and\n\n325\n00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:37.260\nthen relatively changing\nthe reference to where you go down.\n\n326\n00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:38.230\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n&gt;&gt; Pretty neat, right?\n\n327\n00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.960\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n328\n00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:39.750\n&gt;&gt; That's the magic.\n\n329\n00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.940\n&gt;&gt; That was like very, very simple too.\n\n330\n00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:42.840\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Like, you didn't have to\n\n331\n00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:47.180\npush any buttons, there was no worrying\nabout copying things it was just drag and\n\n332\n00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:48.180\nlet go and there you go.\n\n333\n00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:51.865\n&gt;&gt; Yeah copy it down,\nchange the reference so awesome.\n\n334\n00:15:51.865 --> 00:15:56.703\nSo let's come over here, we are going to,\njust to have some fun let's\n\n335\n00:15:56.703 --> 00:16:01.623\ngo with the totals right here I want\nto total up Fuego, we're going to go\n\n336\n00:16:01.623 --> 00:16:06.478\nwith Auto Sum look at that they\nperfectly got it, we want that cool.\n\n337\n00:16:06.478 --> 00:16:08.684\nI'm not gonna pull it down just yet\ncuz I'm gonna do it all together.\n\n338\n00:16:08.684 --> 00:16:09.968\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Watch.\n\n339\n00:16:09.968 --> 00:16:12.660\nSo we're gonna do the average, okay?\n\n340\n00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:13.700\nAverage, but we're not doing that.\n\n341\n00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.491\nDon't click the sigma\ncuz the sigma does what?\n\n342\n00:16:16.491 --> 00:16:17.210\nSums.\n\n343\n00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:18.570\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nIt's the auto sum.\n\n344\n00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:21.220\n&gt;&gt; You want the auto average.\n\n345\n00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:24.590\nWe wanna go ahead and use the average\nfunction and automatically put it in so\n\n346\n00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:29.740\nthat drop-down is just going to tell\nyou to do other things besides the sum.\n\n347\n00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:32.340\nSo don't click the button and\n\n348\n00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:35.030\nthen the drop-down,\njust go straight to the drop-down.\n\n349\n00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.080\nWhat am I averaging?\n\n350\n00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:39.190\nNow careful, if I say, yes,\nthat's it, that's not what I want,\n\n351\n00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:41.960\nis it, cuz it's including the-\n&gt;&gt; Total.\n\n352\n00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:42.730\n&gt;&gt; Total, yeah.\n\n353\n00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:43.510\n&gt;&gt; That's bad.\n\n354\n00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:44.860\n&gt;&gt; So always watch.\n\n355\n00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:46.330\nI want these numbers.\n\n356\n00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:49.137\nThose are the numbers\nthat I want to average.\n\n357\n00:16:49.137 --> 00:16:49.670\nHit Enter.\n\n358\n00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:54.780\nI could select both of these\nwhite plus sign selecting.\n\n359\n00:16:54.780 --> 00:17:00.664\nI want to copy down both\nof these black plus sign,\n\n360\n00:17:00.664 --> 00:17:04.404\nfill handle, drag this down.\n\n361\n00:17:04.404 --> 00:17:05.914\n&gt;&gt; And you're done.\n\n362\n00:17:05.914 --> 00:17:06.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n363\n00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.550\n&gt;&gt; Just like that.\n\n364\n00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:09.790\nShe's just [APPLAUSE] done.\n\n365\n00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:15.420\n&gt;&gt; Now I combined two things into one, but\njust to go back I could have done this.\n\n366\n00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:18.410\nYou always do your first one, okay.\n\n367\n00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:24.430\nComplete it, be done,\nwhite to select what do I want to copy?\n\n368\n00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:29.390\nBlack plus sign to copy, fill handle\nbottom right-hand corner, drag down.\n\n369\n00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:31.120\nI get a lot of people that will do this.\n\n370\n00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.147\nThey'll say, I want this and\nit didn't work.\n\n371\n00:17:33.147 --> 00:17:35.670\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That's because we're selecting.\n\n372\n00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:40.819\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, select, stop, then copy.\n\n373\n00:17:40.819 --> 00:17:43.260\nYay, and then the same one over here.\n\n374\n00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.162\nLet's go ahead and do, ooh,\nI'm gonna do one more trick for you.\n\n375\n00:17:45.162 --> 00:17:48.750\nOkay here, I wanna copy this down.\n\n376\n00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:54.010\nThis time, different way, I'm gonna\ndo exactly what I told you not to do.\n\n377\n00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:54.539\n&gt;&gt; Okay, you select everything.\n\n378\n00:17:54.539 --> 00:17:58.598\n&gt;&gt; Take the white plus sign, and\nselect down, whoops, went too far.\n\n379\n00:17:58.598 --> 00:18:00.330\n&gt;&gt; Too much, now you've done it.\n\n380\n00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:03.450\n&gt;&gt; Let's go there we go, Ctrl+Y, redo.\n\n381\n00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:05.398\nWhite plus select, again.\n\n382\n00:18:05.398 --> 00:18:06.123\n&gt;&gt; You did it again.\n\n383\n00:18:06.123 --> 00:18:07.912\n&gt;&gt; Stop.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right there.\n\n384\n00:18:07.912 --> 00:18:11.956\n&gt;&gt; There's a cool little\nfunction called Ctrl+D.\n\n385\n00:18:11.956 --> 00:18:14.421\nCtrl+D is your shortcut for fill down.\n\n386\n00:18:14.421 --> 00:18:16.890\nDown for D, and then what did it do?\n\n387\n00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:17.650\nBloop.\n\n388\n00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:18.280\n&gt;&gt; Filled it in.\n\n389\n00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.400\n&gt;&gt; Copied it right on down.\n\n390\n00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.620\n&gt;&gt; So if you accidentally did\ngrab that white plus sign and\n\n391\n00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:25.670\ndrag it down and\nselect it instead of fill.\n\n392\n00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:27.080\nYou just go well Ctrl+D, there you go.\n\n393\n00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:31.580\n&gt;&gt; I always think of d as duplicate,\nwhich is really copy.\n\n394\n00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.380\nBut it's also down,\ncuz it doesn't work to the right.\n\n395\n00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.090\n[LAUGH] It doesn't work\nif we're going across.\n\n396\n00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.110\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it's built down, not to across.\n\n397\n00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:40.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Is that a control error or something?\n\n398\n00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:41.380\nNo, that's select all.\n\n399\n00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:42.625\n&gt;&gt; I don't remember honestly.\n\n400\n00:18:42.625 --> 00:18:44.570\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't even exist.\n\n401\n00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:48.156\n&gt;&gt; There's something,\nwe'd have to Google it, so.\n\n402\n00:18:48.156 --> 00:18:49.185\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n403\n00:18:49.185 --> 00:18:51.410\n&gt;&gt; All right, so last bit of parts here,\n\n404\n00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:53.180\nlast bit of parts.\n\n405\n00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:55.830\nWe have commission because\nthis is relative reference,\n\n406\n00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:57.890\nrelative reference is fantastic.\n\n407\n00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:00.020\nWhat about absolute reference?\n\n408\n00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:01.468\nLet's come over here, commission.\n\n409\n00:19:01.468 --> 00:19:05.269\nI had a commission, right,\nwhich is right over here, 10%.\n\n410\n00:19:05.269 --> 00:19:06.780\nIt's in K3.\n\n411\n00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:09.683\nWell, our commission would be,\nthis is not a function.\n\n412\n00:19:09.683 --> 00:19:11.820\nBecause this is really just saying what?\n\n413\n00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:14.190\nTake this times this.\n\n414\n00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:18.011\nTake my total, times it by 10%,\ncuz that would be my commission, right?\n\n415\n00:19:18.011 --> 00:19:20.472\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So that's where you have to get out of,\n\n416\n00:19:20.472 --> 00:19:23.000\nthere isn't a function for this one.\n\n417\n00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.320\nIt's just take this times this.\n\n418\n00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.740\nSo this would be a formula.\n\n419\n00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:35.567\n&gt;&gt; Start with equals, here's my cell,\nasterisk times that cell, I get $16.\n\n420\n00:19:35.567 --> 00:19:36.920\nAnd by the way-\n&gt;&gt; And $0.40.\n\n421\n00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:39.370\n&gt;&gt; I already preformatted these cells.\n\n422\n00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:41.530\nThis doesn't just automatically turn into-\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n423\n00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:43.500\nbecause you have the dollar sign and\neverything there.\n\n424\n00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:46.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nI did that with these particular cells.\n\n425\n00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:49.926\nSo what I have here, now, if I'm getting\nall excited, yeah, let's go, and\n\n426\n00:19:49.926 --> 00:19:52.483\nthen we pull on this down,\nand you're like, what?\n\n427\n00:19:52.483 --> 00:19:54.900\n[LAUGH] What happened?\n\n428\n00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:58.385\n&gt;&gt; It's gotta be because you have\nthe absolute reference of the 10%,\n\n429\n00:19:58.385 --> 00:20:02.000\nwhich is fine, it doesn't change,\nbut the total reference cell does.\n\n430\n00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.440\nAnd it doesn't know what\nthe heck is going on.\n\n431\n00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:09.676\n&gt;&gt; Cuz when I pull it down,\nyou're on the right track, It is here,\n\n432\n00:20:09.676 --> 00:20:12.819\nlet's come into here, E2, yes, times K3.\n\n433\n00:20:12.819 --> 00:20:16.519\nRelative reference moves down to, yes,\n\n434\n00:20:16.519 --> 00:20:20.897\ngo to E3 times, it moves down, to K4, yes.\n\n435\n00:20:20.897 --> 00:20:22.260\n&gt;&gt; It's the other way.\n\n436\n00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.320\n&gt;&gt; So what you need is what you said.\n\n437\n00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.120\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; We needed it to be absolute.\n\n438\n00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:29.890\nSo always keep going back to here,\nthis one moves down.\n\n439\n00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:31.160\n&gt;&gt; And it moves down with it.\n\n440\n00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.340\nThat's with the relative reference.\n\n441\n00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:33.730\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So we have to change it.\n\n442\n00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:36.200\nSo by default,\nrelative reference is what it does.\n\n443\n00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:36.959\n&gt;&gt; We have to say, no, no no.\n\n444\n00:20:36.959 --> 00:20:38.630\nThis is absolute reference.\n\n445\n00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:40.512\n&gt;&gt; We have to glue something in place.\n\n446\n00:20:40.512 --> 00:20:41.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n447\n00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:47.630\n&gt;&gt; In this particular formula, E2,\nwhen I copy you, you relatively go.\n\n448\n00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:48.843\nK3, you stay put.\n\n449\n00:20:48.843 --> 00:20:51.030\nYou can't go anywhere.\n\n450\n00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:53.390\nI'm gonna make you an absolute reference.\n\n451\n00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:55.600\nSo we're going to put in the dollar signs.\n\n452\n00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:00.880\nNow if you're on a full size keyboard,\nand you have an F4 key, you could click\n\n453\n00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:06.350\nyour cursor anywhere in here, in front\nof the K, in between, in the back.\n\n454\n00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:09.640\nAs long as you have your cursor\nsomewhere in this reference, and\n\n455\n00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:13.780\nyou do F4, it will automatically\nput the dollar signs in for you.\n\n456\n00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:18.640\n&gt;&gt; And if you do F4 again it will then\ncycle through putting it in front of just\n\n457\n00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.040\nthe column.\n\n458\n00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:22.370\nHit F4 again or just the row.\n\n459\n00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:26.370\nI don't have an F4 key on my keyboard,\nso I'm going to physically come in and\n\n460\n00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:29.130\nput my cursor in front of the K and\ndollar sign.\n\n461\n00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:36.490\nPut my cursor in front of the 3, dollar\nsign, I am saying, don't ever move row or\n\n462\n00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:40.860\ncolumn reference within the cell\nreference and you're going to stay put.\n\n463\n00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:43.935\nNow in this particular cell,\nremember we're starting at the top,\n\n464\n00:21:43.935 --> 00:21:48.680\nnothing's gonna change here,\nthat's still the same thing, okay?\n\n465\n00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:52.952\nIt's when I take this,\nselecting, black plus to copy,\n\n466\n00:21:52.952 --> 00:21:57.046\nfill down,\nthat's where we get the magic happening.\n\n467\n00:21:57.046 --> 00:22:03.244\nThis is E down three, four,\nfive, relative, K3 never stops,\n\n468\n00:22:03.244 --> 00:22:08.880\nand it always stays and so\nI can get my commission rate.\n\n469\n00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:12.584\nAnd that is what I want just to finish\nthis out because you can't just leave\n\n470\n00:22:12.584 --> 00:22:13.253\nthis empty.\n\n471\n00:22:13.253 --> 00:22:14.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is not a function,\n\n472\n00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:17.290\nwell, I mean, I guess we could, but why?\n\n473\n00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:19.710\nLet's just do it this way,\nwe'll say equals what?\n\n474\n00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:25.270\nWe're taking our total plus\nour commission and then we go.\n\n475\n00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:27.540\nNow just to say, I could do this.\n\n476\n00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:34.300\nI could say, let's go ahead and\nAutoSum this cell.\n\n477\n00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:38.510\nHold my Ctrl key and that cell, right?\n\n478\n00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:39.972\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it means the same thing.\n\n479\n00:22:39.972 --> 00:22:42.586\n&gt;&gt; Standard, yeah,\nstandard control keyboard functions and\n\n480\n00:22:42.586 --> 00:22:44.180\nmouse click functions, right?\n\n481\n00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:46.383\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I'm basically\nsaying add up E2 plus G2.\n\n482\n00:22:46.383 --> 00:22:51.040\nSo I could have just written\nit out by a formula.\n\n483\n00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:54.850\nOr I could use the sum function and\nsay these are the arguments.\n\n484\n00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:57.620\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna give you three guesses\non which one I'm gonna use.\n\n485\n00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:58.190\n&gt;&gt; This one?\n\n486\n00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:58.875\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n487\n00:22:58.875 --> 00:23:01.110\n&gt;&gt;

There you go.\n\n518\n00:24:03.702 --> 00:24:06.596\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so it doesn't have to be linear.\n\n519\n00:24:06.596 --> 00:24:09.287\nIt can be squared.\n\n520\n00:24:09.287 --> 00:24:13.380\n[LAUGH] Sorry about that.\n\n521\n00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.390\nAnd the same thing here.\n\n522\n00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:19.010\nI could go ahead and average in this one,\nlet's not do the whole range,\n\n523\n00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:21.931\nwe just wanna average all of these\nbecause those are the totals.\n\n524\n00:24:21.931 --> 00:24:24.127\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And we go ahead and add up them all,\n\n525\n00:24:24.127 --> 00:24:26.930\naverage them, and then this is my average.\n\n526\n00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:30.660\nAnd that's about how much money\nI spend on cat toys a month.\n\n527\n00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:31.960\nActually, maybe.\n\n528\n00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.693\n&gt;&gt;

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.879\nI'm your host,\n\n4\n00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.370\nJustin Denison, and well, we're coming\nback with more Excel functions.\n\n5\n00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.721\nAnd well, in this episode, we're gonna\nbe talking about functions on Mac.\n\n6\n00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.600\nThat seems to be a little foreboding for\nme,\n\n7\n00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.350\nbecause we're talking about\na particular platform, and\n\n8\n00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.960\nwell, I'm guessing someone's\ngonna tell us all about it.\n\n9\n00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.445\nAnd who is that someone,\nthe one, the only Ms.\n\n10\n00:00:33.445 --> 00:00:34.946\nVonne Smith,\nhow are you doing today, Vonne?\n\n11\n00:00:34.946 --> 00:00:36.262\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing wonderful, how are you doing?\n\n12\n00:00:36.262 --> 00:00:40.576\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic, but am I\nright in why we're doing this episode,\n\n13\n00:00:40.576 --> 00:00:41.754\nfunctions on Mac?\n\n14\n00:00:41.754 --> 00:00:44.736\nIs this to highlight some of\nthose nuanced differences or\n\n15\n00:00:44.736 --> 00:00:47.840\nmake sure that we understand,\nhey, every once in a while,\n\n16\n00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.281\nthere's some shenanigans\nthat will crop up.\n\n17\n00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:56.200\n&gt;&gt; That is exactly why we're here,\nthere are some very weird shenanigans.\n\n18\n00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.302\nI will just go ahead and tell you\nhonestly that sometimes I'm like, what?\n\n19\n00:01:00.302 --> 00:01:04.900\nBut no, let's go ahead and\nlet's clear the playing field.\n\n20\n00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.805\nFunctions are functions no matter\nwhether you're using on PC and\n\n21\n00:01:09.805 --> 00:01:12.223\nMac for 99.5% of the time.\n\n22\n00:01:12.223 --> 00:01:17.450\nOkay, [LAUGH] so the syntax of\na function is going to be the same.\n\n23\n00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.610\nYou have it starts with an equals,\nyou have sum, S-U-M, open the parenthesis.\n\n24\n00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.970\nHave a cell reference,\nhave a colon for a range, and\n\n25\n00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.881\nthen have another cell reference,\nand close the parentheses.\n\n26\n00:01:27.881 --> 00:01:33.691\nThat's the same, so on the core of what\na function or formula is in Excel,\n\n27\n00:01:33.691 --> 00:01:39.180\nit's gonna be the same in both\nplatforms no matter what.\n\n28\n00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.575\nAsterisks just in case there's\nsome reason why, okay.\n\n29\n00:01:41.575 --> 00:01:45.288\n[LAUGH] But I did wanna take an episode\nto just kinda highlight some of this.\n\n30\n00:01:45.288 --> 00:01:49.503\nBecause this particular series,\nthe Excel Functions,\n\n31\n00:01:49.503 --> 00:01:53.210\nwe're gonna be doing all\nthe functions on the PC.\n\n32\n00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.670\nSo if you're on a Mac,\nyou're like, what about me?\n\n33\n00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.650\nIt's gonna be the same, but\nlet me show you a few things.\n\n34\n00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.980\nThe biggest difference is going\nto be within the interface and\n\n35\n00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.290\nhow you use the helper dialog\nbox to help you write functions.\n\n36\n00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.720\nIf you were writing it out, just straight,\n\n37\n00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.570\nlike equals and you're typing all of\nthe syntax, it doesn't matter, okay?\n\n38\n00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.498\nSo I wanted to just highlight\na few things for y'all.\n\n39\n00:02:20.498 --> 00:02:24.079\nSo I just said y'all,\nall right, yep, sorry.\n\n40\n00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:27.090\n&gt;&gt; You sure did,\nmy heart fluttered, I got scared.\n\n41\n00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.830\nI didn't know if it was a good thing or\na bad thing.\n\n42\n00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.450\nBut I say y'all as well, so\nI'm gonna let it fly this time.\n\n43\n00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I try not to too much, I'm like,\nthat just came out, so all right.\n\n44\n00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.270\nWell, here we go, let's get started,\nlet's jump on down,\n\n45\n00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.060\nthis is my Macintosh environment.\n\n46\n00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.270\nSo I am going to be switching back and\nforth, so I'm gonna try to not go too\n\n47\n00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.769\nfast, and too much, cuz it might get\na little like, phew, that's enough.\n\n48\n00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.956\nBut this is a Mac environment, and\n\n49\n00:02:50.956 --> 00:02:54.885\nif I switch over to my virtual machine,\nthis is Windows 10.\n\n50\n00:02:54.885 --> 00:03:01.560\nLooks pretty much the same, okay,\nyeah, for the most part, it is.\n\n51\n00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.480\nOkay, so if I come back over here\nto the Mac, if I look at it,\n\n52\n00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.910\nI still have my ribbons and everything.\n\n53\n00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.330\nIf I go to the Formulas ribbon,\nit's the same stuff in here, right there,\n\n54\n00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.820\ngrouped the same.\n\n55\n00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.580\nThey didn't change how they're\nactually grouping functions.\n\n56\n00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.310\nSo the logical functions are the logical\nfunctions, and the text functions,\n\n57\n00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.880\nand so on and so forth.\n\n58\n00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.620\nAlmost every single button\non the PC is in the Mac\n\n59\n00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.030\nenvironment on this particular ribbon.\n\n60\n00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.720\nExcept for the watch window,\nthe watch window is a PC only type thing.\n\n61\n00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.736\nIt's not in Mac altogether,\nbut it's a small thing.\n\n62\n00:03:34.736 --> 00:03:37.202\nSome people might think,\nit's the best thing ever.\n\n63\n00:03:37.202 --> 00:03:40.409\nI will just say it's not\nlike the be all and end all,\n\n64\n00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:42.990\nthere's other ways to do things.\n\n65\n00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.460\nSo pretty much all the same,\nand if I'm right here, and\n\n66\n00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.449\nI'm going to type in a very simple\nformula, and I'm using this sum of\n\n67\n00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:56.560\nworkbook as just an example,\nwe're not gonna do everything in it.\n\n68\n00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.610\nIf I just start typing equals, and\nthen I say, let's take my mouse and\n\n69\n00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:08.270\nsay I want this cell plus this cell,\neverything works the same on the PC.\n\n70\n00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.550\nOkay, so it's the same as,\nit's going to start color coding\n\n71\n00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.520\nthe cells along the way for you to be\nable to see everything that you're doing.\n\n72\n00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.320\nOkay, that cell plus this cell,\nmaybe plus this one, and\n\n73\n00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.220\nthen minus this cell, okay, great.\n\n74\n00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.830\nThe green, the blue,\nthe purple, all that's great,\n\n75\n00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.630\nI hit Enter to accept it, no difference.\n\n76\n00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.931\nIf I come back into the cell\ndouble click on it,\n\n77\n00:04:35.931 --> 00:04:37.883\nI'm still gonna see the color coding.\n\n78\n00:04:37.883 --> 00:04:42.940\nGreat ways of just trying to see\nwhere you're at and what's going on\n\n79\n00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:49.380\nwhen you're doing your calculations,\nso nothing too terribly crazy there.\n\n80\n00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.710\nNow, if I start typing in\na function in the Mac,\n\n81\n00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.810\nthe one thing you will miss if\nyou're coming from a PC environment.\n\n82\n00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.650\nIf you've never been on a PC environment,\n\n83\n00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.340\nthen you're like,\nthis is how it's always been.\n\n84\n00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:08.410\nBut I start typing equals,\nand then S-U-M or sum,\n\n85\n00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.330\nnotice it doesn't give me anything, it\ndoesn't give me any hints or suggestions.\n\n86\n00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.950\nIf I just said open the parentheses,\nnow this part, yes.\n\n87\n00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.170\nThis, hey, what is this function,\n\n88\n00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.360\nwhat are the arguments within\nthis particular function.\n\n89\n00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.710\nThis is gonna say give me a number,\nand then there is a coma, so\n\n90\n00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.650\nI would need to type\nphysically in the coma.\n\n91\n00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.280\nAnd then, say, this one,\nclose the parentheses, hit Enter,\n\n92\n00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.750\nit performs the sum function\nof those two cells.\n\n93\n00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.840\nThe thing is, if you switch over to a PC,\nand I started here,\n\n94\n00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.760\nand I typed in equals s.\n\n95\n00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.650\nDo you see how it automatically\ngives me all these cool suggestions\n\n96\n00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.630\nof all the functions that\nstart with the letter s?\n\n97\n00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.680\nAnd then it starts kind of drilling\ndown through if I type in sum.\n\n98\n00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.400\nAnd then it's gonna give me all of the\nfunctions that have this particular name.\n\n99\n00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:05.220\nSo this little suggestion box,\nthis little helper, that doesn't exist.\n\n100\n00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:11.170\nIs that a huge difference,\nI don't think it's that big of a deal.\n\n101\n00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.591\nAnd it's one of those things, if you\nalready know it, you already know it.\n\n102\n00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:17.620\nIf you don't, these suggestions may help,\nwhat's the sum product?\n\n103\n00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:23.603\nWhat's this sum x 2 MYP 2, that one's\nactually kinda scary there, Justin.\n\n104\n00:06:23.603 --> 00:06:29.119\nSo is it a deal breaker, I don't think so.\n\n105\n00:06:29.119 --> 00:06:33.105\n&gt;&gt; It's not a deal breaker I could see\nthis being if you have more of those\n\n106\n00:06:33.105 --> 00:06:36.914\nesoteric functions where you're like,\nis it count, countit?\n\n107\n00:06:36.914 --> 00:06:40.330\nMaybe there's some other counts\nthat actually fit your use case.\n\n108\n00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.263\nThis does give you kind of a push,\nyou're like, I know it's a count, and\n\n109\n00:06:44.263 --> 00:06:45.287\nI wanna do a count.\n\n110\n00:06:45.287 --> 00:06:48.980\nAnd maybe you were planning on trying\nto cobble together, I'm gonna do this\n\n111\n00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.282\nintermediate value and then use\ncount here and do this other stuff.\n\n112\n00:06:52.282 --> 00:06:55.461\nRight, but then you find out,\nor in this case, sum product,\n\n113\n00:06:55.461 --> 00:06:57.450\nI don't even know what that means.\n\n114\n00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.080\nYou're like, wait a minute,\n\n115\n00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.600\nI was gonna multiply some things together\nand then add them, maybe that fits?\n\n116\n00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.270\nAnd then you do some research,\nso on the plus side,\n\n117\n00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:10.250\nit can be helpful that it'll let you\nknow of things that are like that.\n\n118\n00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.190\nOn the downside, I can see for\nme, this would just lead to\n\n119\n00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:17.850\nthis endless rabbit hole of going,\nwhat is sum mxy24829?\n\n120\n00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.892\nI don't know what it is, but I feel really\ncompelled to look it up now, Vonne.\n\n121\n00:07:22.892 --> 00:07:25.283\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I might be doing that off camera.\n\n122\n00:07:25.283 --> 00:07:29.756\n&gt;&gt; Well, the thing is,\nthat whole I wanna know what this does,\n\n123\n00:07:29.756 --> 00:07:33.280\nthat lives in, we're in PC land right now.\n\n124\n00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.920\nIf I go to this f(x) button,\nthis insert function dialog box button.\n\n125\n00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.480\nIt brings us up and\nthen I can go ahead and look that up.\n\n126\n00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.280\nIt's gonna tell me what everything does,\nand it's like, okay.\n\n127\n00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.015\nWell, then that's where I tell people\nto go to when they're starting.\n\n128\n00:07:47.015 --> 00:07:52.182\nGo to the insert function dialog box,\nokay, let it tell you what you need to do.\n\n129\n00:07:52.182 --> 00:07:55.269\nWell, on the Mac side, you have that,\n\n130\n00:07:55.269 --> 00:08:00.360\nthey just don't call it\nthe insert function dialog box.\n\n131\n00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.172\nIt's the same button.\n\n132\n00:08:01.172 --> 00:08:05.670\nOkay, so when I click it, it just brings\nup what they call the Formula Builder.\n\n133\n00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:09.470\nOkay, cuz formulas and functions we\nknow that they're pretty much the same.\n\n134\n00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.910\nThe functions are just pre-made formulas.\n\n135\n00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:13.950\nSo then it brings this up.\n\n136\n00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:19.280\nAnd so if I was looking for the sum\nproduct, and then notice, as soon as\n\n137\n00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:25.530\nI start typing here, it does start giving\nme the examples or what it needs to do.\n\n138\n00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:27.590\nAnd it's behind my head,\nbut if you look and\n\n139\n00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.780\nmy resolution is also\na little higher right now.\n\n140\n00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:35.740\nSee, it's gonna go ahead and give me,\nI can't get it to actually get down there.\n\n141\n00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:40.840\nBut when you have a lower resolution it\nwill actually show you what this does and\n\n142\n00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.310\nyou can go ahead and read on it.\n\n143\n00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:45.350\nAnd if you need more help of the function,\nthen it brings this up and\n\n144\n00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:47.960\nthen it will tell you\nexactly what everything is.\n\n145\n00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.980\nSo, it's in there, okay.\n\n146\n00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:55.530\nIt's just not in that cute little droppy\ndown thing that the PC World has.\n\n147\n00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:57.620\nYou still got it over there.\n\n148\n00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.340\nAnd you have the Insert function.\n\n149\n00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:02.430\nSorry.\n[LAUGH] If the Formula Builder\n\n150\n00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:06.580\npanel that pops up,\nit's also not a free floating panel.\n\n151\n00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:10.420\nSo if I wanted to bring in this one I\ncould and then I can enter the function.\n\n152\n00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:14.230\nI'm just gonna click a little X there and\nI'm just gonna click the X there just for\n\n153\n00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:17.630\na second just to kinda bring\nit around of like, all right.\n\n154\n00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:19.660\nSo now let's go ahead and\n\n155\n00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:25.780\nexplain a little bit more about\nthat particular panel over there.\n\n156\n00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:31.657\nAnd here's where there's gonna\nbe a couple gotchas that\n\n157\n00:09:31.657 --> 00:09:39.140\nit [LAUGH] kinda drives me a little\nbatty sometimes, I will tell you that.\n\n158\n00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:43.281\nI know it's supposed to try to help you\nand it's good to walk you through and\n\n159\n00:09:43.281 --> 00:09:45.580\nI really emphasize this.\n\n160\n00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:49.050\nIn all of the episodes that you're\ngoing to be watching in the library,\n\n161\n00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:50.930\nlike use the dialogue box.\n\n162\n00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:54.660\nIt'll make it so much easier for\nyourself because it tells you things.\n\n163\n00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:57.181\nLet me give you a few,\n[NOISE], let's be careful.\n\n164\n00:09:57.181 --> 00:10:00.970\nAll right, so let's just do a sum,\nwhich is something pretty basic.\n\n165\n00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.860\nI'm just randomly picking a cell.\n\n166\n00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:07.812\nI could ahead and bring it over here and\nactually sum up the bouncy balls and\n\n167\n00:10:07.812 --> 00:10:11.595\nthe crinkle balls, but, [SOUND]\nlet's just kinda go this way, okay?\n\n168\n00:10:11.595 --> 00:10:16.380\nWe're going to click on\nthe Formula Builder.\n\n169\n00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:20.010\nYou can tell I've been doing\na lot of functions [LAUGH] in PC.\n\n170\n00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:23.220\nSo let's right here, and\nlet's go ahead and click Insert.\n\n171\n00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.224\nNow notice how I have those cells selected\nof where I want to start typing this in.\n\n172\n00:10:26.224 --> 00:10:30.160\nAnd maybe you're like,\nokay, this is great.\n\n173\n00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:30.930\nLet's put this in.\n\n174\n00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:32.260\nAnd now you're like, you know what?\n\n175\n00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.780\nLet's just pull this guy out.\n\n176\n00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:37.390\nAnd you can undock this, okay?\n\n177\n00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:40.850\nThe thing is if you undock this it,\n\n178\n00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:45.410\nwatch, see how it's automatically\nstarting to write my function now.\n\n179\n00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:49.440\nWell, when I click the close on here, do\nyou see how it's still, look at what it's\n\n180\n00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.680\ndoing, it's still trying to well,\nwait, do you wanna write something?\n\n181\n00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.700\nAnd I 'm like, wait, well,\nactually look what I just did.\n\n182\n00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.690\n[LAUGH] I just totally crashed Excel.\n\n183\n00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:01.450\nKey word, don't do this.\n\n184\n00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:05.300\nOkay, just leave the function dialogue\nbox, the Formula Builder in the place\n\n185\n00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.910\nwhere it's supposed to be because I\nactually wasn't expecting it to do that.\n\n186\n00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:10.480\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nlooks like you broke it real good.\n\n187\n00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.240\nI tell you,\nthat was not what I anticipated.\n\n188\n00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.730\nI figured it was gonna throw up a box or\nsomething.\n\n189\n00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:17.240\nWhat should it have done?\n\n190\n00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.408\nOr did you break it super good.\n\n191\n00:11:19.408 --> 00:11:22.581\n&gt;&gt; Well, this is one of those,\nit does throw a bug out,\n\n192\n00:11:22.581 --> 00:11:26.191\nwhere it's continuing to write\nyour formula or function,\n\n193\n00:11:26.191 --> 00:11:31.700\neven though you close the dialog box,\nit only happens when you undock the panel.\n\n194\n00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.290\nOkay, so I'm not saying this is\ngonna happen every single time.\n\n195\n00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:35.700\nDon't undock the panel.\n\n196\n00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.190\nLet me just tell you that.\n\n197\n00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:39.800\nIt's a weird buggy thing\n\n198\n00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:43.450\nthat you saw actually just\ncrashed my entire application.\n\n199\n00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:48.636\nSo if you're gonna use\nthe Formula Builder, I said it right!\n\n200\n00:11:48.636 --> 00:11:50.420\n[LAUGH] Then just leave it there.\n\n201\n00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:53.630\nSo that's a little gotcha, right?\n\n202\n00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.310\nDon't take it out.\n\n203\n00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:58.520\nSo if I take the sum and\nlet's go ahead and bring this in.\n\n204\n00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.840\nSo let's look at well,\nthese are your arguments, okay, and\n\n205\n00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.380\nit tells you down at the bottom like\nit's gonna explain what's going on.\n\n206\n00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:09.440\nAgain, my resolution's really low,\nbut watch what it says.\n\n207\n00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.440\nSo what is my first number?\n\n208\n00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.180\nThere is a flashing cursor in this field.\n\n209\n00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:18.320\nSo you say, I'd like to total up\nall of the Gainesville stores.\n\n210\n00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.270\nAnd notice I just click, hold and drag,\nand wait, no, that was the wrong one.\n\n211\n00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:23.110\nSo I really want the bouncy balls.\n\n212\n00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:24.880\nAnd you see how it's changing, right?\n\n213\n00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:25.460\nAnd wait, no.\n\n214\n00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:29.730\nAnd I really wanted the snake one,\nthat's my first set of numbers.\n\n215\n00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:32.250\nNow I would like to put in\nanother set of numbers.\n\n216\n00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:34.780\nSo I click in the field,\nthat's another thing.\n\n217\n00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:38.800\nAlways get your cursor into\nthe field that you want to populate\n\n218\n00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:44.020\nregardless of the platform, and\nthen I also wanna get the heart maps.\n\n219\n00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.720\nAnd no, wait,\nI really wanted the bouncy ball.\n\n220\n00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.550\nNothing's wrong so far, right?\n\n221\n00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:49.150\nAnd you're like, okay, that's great.\n\n222\n00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:51.120\nYou click Done, and nothing's wrong.\n\n223\n00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:55.830\nSo you're like, well, why do you keep\nmaking this seem so like don't do this?\n\n224\n00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:57.260\nI didn't say don't do this.\n\n225\n00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:57.990\nI said be careful.\n\n226\n00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:04.187\nLet me try to break it and\nshow you how it can get a little wonky.\n\n227\n00:13:04.187 --> 00:13:09.066\nSo let's say I wanna have another\nsum here, and I click the f(x) and\n\n228\n00:13:09.066 --> 00:13:11.080\nthen I click the sum.\n\n229\n00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.660\nAnd now I want to grab these cells, cool.\n\n230\n00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:18.830\nThen I grab number two and I would like,\nlet's say, maybe a couple of the Orlandos.\n\n231\n00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:22.080\nI'm randomly picking cell\nreferences by the way.\n\n232\n00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.690\nThen I want a third set of numbers to add.\n\n233\n00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:28.740\nSo notice that in a PC world,\nif you just hit the Tab key,\n\n234\n00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.690\nit's gonna automatically\npop it with another field.\n\n235\n00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:35.110\nYou have to add fields down at the bottom.\n\n236\n00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:39.080\nCuz you can have three, you can have four,\nyou can have four sets, but\n\n237\n00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.860\nyou have to click the button\nto add multiple arguments for\n\n238\n00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:45.930\nfunctions that allow multiple arguments.\n\n239\n00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:47.340\nNow, this is the kicker.\n\n240\n00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.490\nNotice, where's my cursor right now?\n\n241\n00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:51.500\nMy cursor is in number two.\n\n242\n00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:55.070\nSo I've already added more fields.\n\n243\n00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:59.840\nI forgot on purpose to put my\ncursor here in number three.\n\n244\n00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:05.250\nSo I come out here and say, I want\nthese and then wait, no, no, no, stop.\n\n245\n00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:06.680\nWait, no, stop.\n\n246\n00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:11.210\nDo you see how it's starting to\njust add all of those other cells?\n\n247\n00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:12.130\nAnd it does, and\n\n248\n00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:17.760\nsometimes depending on where the cursor\nis, it can do some really weird syntax.\n\n249\n00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.660\nNo, no, no, no, so be careful about that.\n\n250\n00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:24.180\nIt's like if you clicked out of the field,\ncame back in to edit it, and\n\n251\n00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:30.165\nthen tried to re-change, or change out\nthose numbers, it doesn't like it.\n\n252\n00:14:30.165 --> 00:14:33.505\n[LAUGH] Sorry, you should switch to\nJustin's face because it was just like.\n\n253\n00:14:33.505 --> 00:14:34.630\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hi,\n\n254\n00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:40.390\nI'm trying to figure out why it's B9,\nB9:C9, but, but but, B9 also again.\n\n255\n00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:42.741\nWow, I tell you what,\n\n256\n00:14:42.741 --> 00:14:46.453\nyou might accidentally think you've\ngot a lot of money and you don't.\n\n257\n00:14:46.453 --> 00:14:49.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And this is the weird one,\nI backspaced out of this.\n\n258\n00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:53.094\nThis is like where it just, and\nthen it doesn't, cuz that's why.\n\n259\n00:14:53.094 --> 00:14:55.652\nSee, it's changing, Justin,\nsee, it's changing,\n\n260\n00:14:55.652 --> 00:14:57.633\nit's changing, nothing's going weird.\n\n261\n00:14:57.633 --> 00:15:02.370\nIt's because I was already in the field\nand hadn't switched out to the next field.\n\n262\n00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:08.560\nOkay, so I hope I'm not scaring you,\nI'm just saying it's very,\n\n263\n00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:13.500\nvery meticulous and\nvery particular about how you need\n\n264\n00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:18.510\nto act within the Formula Builder fields.\n\n265\n00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:23.760\nJust be careful, it gets me a lot.\n\n266\n00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:26.550\nNow I've backspaced out of the number two.\n\n267\n00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:28.020\nSo then I come back over to here, and\n\n268\n00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:32.360\nnotice how it's like, wait,\nwhy aren't you making this a range?\n\n269\n00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.508\nYou see what it's doing here?\n\n270\n00:15:33.508 --> 00:15:35.250\nJustin, look at this one.\n\n271\n00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:36.515\nLook at that.\n\n272\n00:15:36.515 --> 00:15:37.785\nWhat is that?\n\n273\n00:15:37.785 --> 00:15:39.710\n&gt;&gt; Looks broke.\n\n274\n00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:44.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, I'm gonna be\ncompletely honest with you guys.\n\n275\n00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.360\nMaybe it's my computer, I don't know.\n\n276\n00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.620\nBut this is very buggy.\n\n277\n00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:53.017\nIn my experience with the Formula Builder\nin the Macintosh environment,\n\n278\n00:15:53.017 --> 00:15:55.199\nit continues to do this to me.\n\n279\n00:15:55.199 --> 00:15:57.040\nHey, though, it might be me.\n\n280\n00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.060\nI don't think so, though.\n\n281\n00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:00.897\nIt's just a little odd.\n\n282\n00:16:00.897 --> 00:16:06.263\nIf you backspace out of values, I am,\nclick, click, click, click, click.\n\n283\n00:16:06.263 --> 00:16:09.692\nAnd then I try to select cells again,\nit doesn't do the range,\n\n284\n00:16:09.692 --> 00:16:10.997\nit gets a little wonky.\n\n285\n00:16:10.997 --> 00:16:14.872\nIf I don't click out of the field to add\nmore numbers, it's just kind of like,\n\n286\n00:16:14.872 --> 00:16:18.312\nit gets all sorts of wrong words,\nit's almost like, you know what?\n\n287\n00:16:18.312 --> 00:16:22.145\nIt's time to just abort, stop, start over.\n\n288\n00:16:22.145 --> 00:16:26.070\nIt might just be better for you to stop,\nstart over, and don't make any mistakes,\n\n289\n00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:27.882\nand do it perfect the very first time.\n\n290\n00:16:27.882 --> 00:16:29.360\nDoes that always happen that way?\n\n291\n00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:33.983\nNo, it doesn't, so just be very careful,\nand sometimes, notice single cell,\n\n292\n00:16:33.983 --> 00:16:35.664\nit seemed to be fine, right?\n\n293\n00:16:35.664 --> 00:16:38.914\nI've had times where I was like, nope,\nI don't want that one, come back and\n\n294\n00:16:38.914 --> 00:16:40.865\nselect a different cell, see, right there.\n\n295\n00:16:40.865 --> 00:16:44.405\nAnd then it puts the plus sign in front\nof it, why are you putting a plus sign?\n\n296\n00:16:44.405 --> 00:16:47.561\nI'm just changing the value, I'm just\nclicking into the cell that I want and\n\n297\n00:16:47.561 --> 00:16:48.202\nit adds a plus.\n\n298\n00:16:48.202 --> 00:16:52.067\nIn some functions,\nthat might throw a complete weird error,\n\n299\n00:16:52.067 --> 00:16:54.608\nwhere it's like, this doesn't work.\n\n300\n00:16:54.608 --> 00:16:59.156\nUgh, okay, yeah,\nit's a little wonky, it really is.\n\n301\n00:16:59.156 --> 00:17:04.140\nIf you get it just right, and\ndo everything, the procedure just right,\n\n302\n00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:07.584\nlike you saw the first time,\nthis should be fine.\n\n303\n00:17:07.584 --> 00:17:13.123\nJust be careful, it will do some\nweird things that if you delete,\n\n304\n00:17:13.123 --> 00:17:15.249\nor don't move forward.\n\n305\n00:17:15.249 --> 00:17:19.699\nOr put yourself into another field and\nthen come back, it does a little weird.\n\n306\n00:17:19.699 --> 00:17:24.678\nThis is where you want to get\ngood with functions to where you\n\n307\n00:17:24.678 --> 00:17:27.575\ndon't have to rely on the helper.\n\n308\n00:17:27.575 --> 00:17:31.561\nSo you don't have to rely on those\ndialog boxes to know what they are.\n\n309\n00:17:31.561 --> 00:17:35.447\nIt takes a while, I mean, when you learn\nsomething, you need a little help, right?\n\n310\n00:17:35.447 --> 00:17:41.368\nBut maybe try to rely on like the syntax\nand understanding, I need a comma here.\n\n311\n00:17:41.368 --> 00:17:45.311\nAnd then I need another closing\nparenthesis, it takes a while,\n\n312\n00:17:45.311 --> 00:17:48.461\nI still have to go to\nthe helper all the time, okay?\n\n313\n00:17:48.461 --> 00:17:55.626\nSo just something to maybe look at,\njust saying.\n\n314\n00:17:55.626 --> 00:18:00.001\nThere's another weird thing that\nhappens when you go to edit a function.\n\n315\n00:18:00.001 --> 00:18:04.887\nNow notice that I do not have the insert\nfunction, the formula builder open,\n\n316\n00:18:04.887 --> 00:18:06.178\nI'm sorry, guys.\n\n317\n00:18:06.178 --> 00:18:10.904\nSo if I come into here, and I double\nclick, here's all my color coding, right?\n\n318\n00:18:10.904 --> 00:18:15.883\nI just hit the Escape just to stop that,\nnow what if I bring this because now I\n\n319\n00:18:15.883 --> 00:18:19.378\nwant to edit this in the insert\nfunction dialog box.\n\n320\n00:18:19.378 --> 00:18:25.165\nI'm sorry, I'm so programmed,\n[LAUGH], the formula builder.\n\n321\n00:18:25.165 --> 00:18:29.050\nNow, it's not color coding,\nwhen I click here, it doesn't color code.\n\n322\n00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:34.891\nIf I even click here,\ninto the function in this function\n\n323\n00:18:34.891 --> 00:18:40.253\nright here [LAUGH],\nit doesn't color code either.\n\n324\n00:18:40.253 --> 00:18:45.137\nIf the formula builder is open,\nit doesn't color code,\n\n325\n00:18:45.137 --> 00:18:49.916\nhm, okay, a little weird,\nI rely on the color coding,\n\n326\n00:18:49.916 --> 00:18:53.202\nI like it, okay, it really helps me.\n\n327\n00:18:53.202 --> 00:18:58.021\nSo just don't have it open and then\nyour color coding will come back, nice.\n\n328\n00:18:58.021 --> 00:19:02.623\nA few little extra tidbits,\nI am on a laptop,\n\n329\n00:19:02.623 --> 00:19:06.627\nyes, I have my wonderful MacBook Pro.\n\n330\n00:19:06.627 --> 00:19:09.437\nAnd the thing is, when you have laptops,\n\n331\n00:19:09.437 --> 00:19:14.353\nespecially the design that I have,\nI don't have function keys, okay?\n\n332\n00:19:14.353 --> 00:19:19.359\nI have the touch bar, okay, and\nJustin, you have a touch bar,\n\n333\n00:19:19.359 --> 00:19:23.721\n[LAUGH], we have a,\nhow do you feel about the touch bar?\n\n334\n00:19:23.721 --> 00:19:24.486\n&gt;&gt; I don't like it.\n\n335\n00:19:24.486 --> 00:19:27.204\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I want my physical function keys back.\n\n336\n00:19:27.204 --> 00:19:27.889\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n337\n00:19:27.889 --> 00:19:31.579\n&gt;&gt; Now, full disclosure,\nthat's because the things that I do,\n\n338\n00:19:31.579 --> 00:19:34.233\nI end up using the function\nkeys a great deal.\n\n339\n00:19:34.233 --> 00:19:38.794\nWhereas I know that if you're in an office\nsetting, or you're a mom, or other people,\n\n340\n00:19:38.794 --> 00:19:41.151\nthey're like, where do you ever use these?\n\n341\n00:19:41.151 --> 00:19:44.819\nAnd I'm like, it's funny you should ask,\nbecause I use them a lot, but\n\n342\n00:19:44.819 --> 00:19:47.303\nyou may not use them, so\nit might not effect you.\n\n343\n00:19:47.303 --> 00:19:49.818\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm honestly half and\nhalf on the touch bar,\n\n344\n00:19:49.818 --> 00:19:52.176\nI probably don't use it\nto its full capability.\n\n345\n00:19:52.176 --> 00:19:58.074\nI do like some of the cute little buttons\nand the the brightness and the volume.\n\n346\n00:19:58.074 --> 00:20:01.238\nIt's taking me a while to get used to it,\nbecause I like my old [SOUND],\n\n347\n00:20:01.238 --> 00:20:02.393\nlike my little buttons.\n\n348\n00:20:02.393 --> 00:20:06.875\nBut I rely on the functions keys a lot,\ntoo, and so you can make,\n\n349\n00:20:06.875 --> 00:20:10.786\nI wish I could show you a picture\nof my screen right here.\n\n350\n00:20:10.786 --> 00:20:15.174\nOr my keyboard, but it has the function\nkeys across on the touch bar.\n\n351\n00:20:15.174 --> 00:20:18.264\nYou can do this for a Macintosh, for\n\n352\n00:20:18.264 --> 00:20:24.345\na macOS if you go into your\nSystem Preferences, you go into Keyboard.\n\n353\n00:20:24.345 --> 00:20:29.406\nAnd when I'm in Keyboard,\nyou go into Shortcuts, there it is,\n\n354\n00:20:29.406 --> 00:20:33.831\nShortcuts, I have it written\nout in the episode notes.\n\n355\n00:20:33.831 --> 00:20:37.881\nBut if I go to Shortcuts and\ngo to Function Keys,\n\n356\n00:20:37.881 --> 00:20:42.762\nthis is where I can have this\nshow up in my particular app.\n\n357\n00:20:42.762 --> 00:20:46.054\nNow, notice I have Microsoft Excel and\n\n358\n00:20:46.054 --> 00:20:51.656\nI also have the VMware Fusion app,\nthat means my virtual machine.\n\n359\n00:20:51.656 --> 00:20:54.842\nSo that way,\nwhen I am in these applications,\n\n360\n00:20:54.842 --> 00:20:57.880\nmy touch bar across the top, see, Justin?\n\n361\n00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:01.199\nHe's looking over, he's like, look at\nthat, yeah, I have my function keys.\n\n362\n00:21:01.199 --> 00:21:05.943\nSo I can pick whatever application I\nwant to have the function keys, and\n\n363\n00:21:05.943 --> 00:21:09.281\nthey actually work,\ndid you know that, Justin?\n\n364\n00:21:09.281 --> 00:21:10.034\n&gt;&gt; I didn't.\n\n365\n00:21:10.034 --> 00:21:11.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Mainly because I just try\n\n366\n00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:13.181\nto stay away from that\nthing as much as possible.\n\n367\n00:21:13.181 --> 00:21:15.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I'll tell you what,\n\n368\n00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:16.790\nwe're going to have to\ntalk after this episode,\n\n369\n00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:18.500\nmaybe I can just set mine\nto always be function keys.\n\n370\n00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:19.533\nAnd then I won't feel as bad.\n\n371\n00:21:19.533 --> 00:21:22.459\n&gt;&gt; You can,\nI can't remember off the top of my head.\n\n372\n00:21:22.459 --> 00:21:24.371\nI would have to honestly look it up but\n\n373\n00:21:24.371 --> 00:21:27.033\nI am pretty sure that you\ncan have it on all the time.\n\n374\n00:21:27.033 --> 00:21:30.519\nIf not, at least you can have it for\nevery single app that you ever open, so\n\n375\n00:21:30.519 --> 00:21:31.653\nthat might work, too.\n\n376\n00:21:31.653 --> 00:21:37.218\nSo yep, to be honest, I was like,\nreally, [LAUGH], that's kind of nice,\n\n377\n00:21:37.218 --> 00:21:41.307\nI just recently learned that,\ntoo, so full disclosure.\n\n378\n00:21:41.307 --> 00:21:45.520\nAnd the last one I wanted to talk about,\nthis is a weird one,\n\n379\n00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.572\nare you guys ever going to encounter this?\n\n380\n00:21:48.572 --> 00:21:53.822\nI'm not sure, but I did,\nor we did collectively\n\n381\n00:21:53.822 --> 00:21:58.441\nhere at ITProTV, let me set the scenario.\n\n382\n00:21:58.441 --> 00:22:01.983\nPhillip was asking for some Excel help,\nhe came to me and Mike.\n\n383\n00:22:01.983 --> 00:22:04.169\nMike and I are like,\nwe figured it out, mostly Mike,\n\n384\n00:22:04.169 --> 00:22:06.417\nbecause it was pretty complex,\nand I was like, okay.\n\n385\n00:22:06.417 --> 00:22:11.375\nIt was all sorts of finance stuff,\nso Mike's like, let me go ahead and\n\n386\n00:22:11.375 --> 00:22:13.680\nwrite this, yeah, I got it!\n\n387\n00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.372\nLet me go ahead and send it to you,\nso he did a little test file.\n\n388\n00:22:16.372 --> 00:22:20.215\nHe sent it to Phillip, and\nPhillip's like, it won't work, he's like,\n\n389\n00:22:20.215 --> 00:22:21.130\nwhat do you mean?\n\n390\n00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:23.988\nAnd Mike's like, no, it works just fine!\n\n391\n00:22:23.988 --> 00:22:30.941\nMike's on a PC, Phillip is on a Mac,\nhm, why didn't it work?\n\n392\n00:22:30.941 --> 00:22:37.494\nSo Justin, do you know what a curly\nquote and a straight quote is?\n\n393\n00:22:37.494 --> 00:22:39.854\n&gt;&gt; You're making that up.\n\n394\n00:22:39.854 --> 00:22:42.791\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, I'm not.\n\n395\n00:22:42.791 --> 00:22:46.378\n&gt;&gt; Uhh, nope [LAUGH].\n\n396\n00:22:46.378 --> 00:22:51.175\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, this is also-\n&gt;&gt; Actually, yeah, I've encountered this.\n\n397\n00:22:51.175 --> 00:22:51.675\n&gt;&gt; You have?\n\n398\n00:22:51.675 --> 00:22:53.955\n&gt;&gt; Because of copy and\npaste, you've got the,\n\n399\n00:22:53.955 --> 00:22:56.063\nit kind of looks like\na comma at the quote.\n\n400\n00:22:56.063 --> 00:22:58.864\nAnd you're like, those are the same thing,\nbut they're not.\n\n401\n00:22:58.864 --> 00:22:59.840\n&gt;&gt; You know of this.\n\n402\n00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:00.826\n&gt;&gt; They're not the same.\n\n403\n00:23:00.826 --> 00:23:03.078\nYeah, because it's caused\nissues in source code,\n\n404\n00:23:03.078 --> 00:23:06.587\nwhen you're trying to pull it\nfrom a sample bar or something.\n\n405\n00:23:06.587 --> 00:23:09.277\n&gt;&gt; Or if someone's typed it and\nsent you a message,\n\n406\n00:23:09.277 --> 00:23:11.255\nsometimes you get the curly quote.\n\n407\n00:23:11.255 --> 00:23:14.961\nAnd it doesn't behave the same, and\nstuff's jacked, and you're like, well,\n\n408\n00:23:14.961 --> 00:23:15.724\nthat's weird.\n\n409\n00:23:15.724 --> 00:23:19.056\n&gt;&gt; Yes, my gosh, so this is\nsomething you have encountered, too.\n\n410\n00:23:19.056 --> 00:23:23.902\nOkay good, so it's, if you've encountered\nit, I've encountered it, you probably,\n\n411\n00:23:23.902 --> 00:23:26.918\nwell, you might have as well,\nor at least you now know.\n\n412\n00:23:26.918 --> 00:23:32.387\nI'm in Mac, I'm in Word,\nif I, did you see it?\n\n413\n00:23:32.387 --> 00:23:33.386\nDid you see it happen?\n\n414\n00:23:33.386 --> 00:23:37.962\n[SOUND] Okay, I'll do it one more time,\nwatch, ready?\n\n415\n00:23:37.962 --> 00:23:43.418\nIt starts straight and then it curves,\nyes, why is it doing that?\n\n416\n00:23:43.418 --> 00:23:45.174\nThis is the preference, okay?\n\n417\n00:23:45.174 --> 00:23:48.548\nBecause Macs are a little bit\nmore stylish, okay, right?\n\n418\n00:23:48.548 --> 00:23:52.121\nSo if we wanted to just say, quote,\n\n419\n00:23:52.121 --> 00:23:57.494\nit makes curly quotes as\nopposed to straight quotes.\n\n420\n00:23:57.494 --> 00:23:59.839\nNow how am I going to\nmake it a straight quote?\n\n421\n00:23:59.839 --> 00:24:03.334\nThis, in Word, okay, and I know,\nwe're like, this isn't Word, I understand,\n\n422\n00:24:03.334 --> 00:24:04.738\nbut it goes along the same lines.\n\n423\n00:24:04.738 --> 00:24:09.076\nIf I go into the autocorrect And\nthen go into the Auto Format as you type.\n\n424\n00:24:09.076 --> 00:24:14.060\nYou can see right there,\nstraight quotes with smart quotes.\n\n425\n00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:17.205\nThey also call curly quotes,\nsmart quotes, okay?\n\n426\n00:24:17.205 --> 00:24:20.970\n[LAUGH] He's giving me sideways looks, hm.\n\n427\n00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:22.400\nSo yeah, that's what it's going to do.\n\n428\n00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:28.000\nIf I turn this off, and\nthen close this, and now if I\n\n429\n00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.680\ncome here,\ndo you see how now it stays straight.\n\n430\n00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:39.080\nSo, that is the difference between curly\nor smart quotes versus straight quotes.\n\n431\n00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:44.900\nDoesn't seem like a big deal, but it will\nwreck you a little bit if you've got\n\n432\n00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:50.660\nsomebody from a PC trying to bring over\na function that has quotes around a lot\n\n433\n00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:55.460\nof stuff into your Macintosh environment,\nit can be a little weird, okay?\n\n434\n00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.640\nAnd then we had to look for this.\n\n435\n00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:58.700\nI mean, it took us a while.\n\n436\n00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:00.200\nI'm like, wait.\n\n437\n00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.360\nCause I noticed it.\n\n438\n00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.605\nWell, you know why I noticed it?\n\n439\n00:25:02.605 --> 00:25:06.740\nCause I do typography and I love fonts and\nI love typesetting and everything.\n\n440\n00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:09.770\nSo that's why I'm like, wait,\nno, wait, that's a curly quote.\n\n441\n00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:13.080\nAnd that's what was causing problems.\n\n442\n00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:16.660\nHow we fixed it,\nit's in your system preferences.\n\n443\n00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:19.540\nThis isn't an application preference.\n\n444\n00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:24.000\nWe had to go into the system\npreferences of Philip's machine,\n\n445\n00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.500\ngo into keyboard and\nI believe it is text, yes right here.\n\n446\n00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:32.110\nYou see use smart quotes and dashes.\n\n447\n00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:33.540\nJust check that off.\n\n448\n00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:36.320\nThat way the system doesn't do that.\n\n449\n00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:40.820\nSo Mac won't, or Excel won't do that.\n\n450\n00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:43.560\nOnce you turn that off,\nhe might have had to like restart.\n\n451\n00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:44.480\nJust for fun.\n\n452\n00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:48.380\nThen he went ahead and\nopened the file, did the function.\n\n453\n00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:48.970\nEverything was fine.\n\n454\n00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:56.494\nWeird, strange,\nvery kinda minute that you might oversee.\n\n455\n00:25:56.494 --> 00:26:00.339\nWell now hopefully, since you've\nheard me ramble on about quotes,\n\n456\n00:26:00.339 --> 00:26:04.600\nit might make it a little bit easier and\nunderstand why you're doing that.\n\n457\n00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:08.480\nSo just a few little things about your,\n\n458\n00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:13.440\nthings you might encounter as\na Mac user doing your functions.\n\n459\n00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.220\nLittle things, right?\n\n460\n00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:19.315\nNot too terrible hard, but\nthat formula builder, I said it right!\n\n461\n00:26:19.315 --> 00:26:22.661\n[SOUND] I fight with it.\n\n462\n00:26:22.661 --> 00:26:26.810\nI'll be honest, I do fight with it,\nso I tend to not use it as much.\n\n463\n00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:30.670\nOr at least I just know and\nI just cancel and start over and\n\n464\n00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:32.350\nthat usually will fix the problems.\n\n465\n00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:35.150\n&gt;&gt; Well, in the famous words,\nknowing's half the battle.\n\n466\n00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:36.464\nYou definitely have to know this.\n\n467\n00:26:36.464 --> 00:26:38.996\nIt's just educate this gadget.\n\n468\n00:26:38.996 --> 00:26:40.860\nThis will going to bring down\nour frustration level and\n\n469\n00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:42.720\nallow us to be a little more productive.\n\n470\n00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:46.550\nNow Vonne, before we head out of here,\nare there any final parting words?\n\n471\n00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:49.570\n&gt;&gt; Just from we're going\nthrough our different examples\n\n472\n00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:53.070\nof functions within the function library,\nand other examples, and\n\n473\n00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:58.480\nyou are in Mac,\njust try to really look at the syntax.\n\n474\n00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:01.470\nAnd use that and understand\n\n475\n00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:06.060\nthe composition of the function\ncause it will work the same way.\n\n476\n00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:07.540\nAnd just watch about those quotes.\n\n477\n00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:12.200\nOkay, so just in case you're like, it will\nbe the same way for most of the time.\n\n478\n00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.927\nI always going to keep myself open\njust in case something else goes\n\n479\n00:27:15.927 --> 00:27:17.230\na little wonky on you.\n\n480\n00:27:18.641 --> 00:27:21.700\n&gt;&gt; That's all I have to say\nabout those smart quotes is.\n\n481\n00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:25.620\nWell, definitely come on back as we\ncontinue looking at more Excel functions.\n\n482\n00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:27.440\nBut for now we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n483\n00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:30.280\nSo signing off for Office Pro TV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n484\n00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:30.930\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n485\n00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:32.849\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n486\n00:27:32.849 --> 00:27:37.277\n[SOUND]\n\n",

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.354 --> 00:00:16.931\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison,\n\n4\n00:00:16.931 --> 00:00:19.886\nand I'm glad you made it back\nbecause we got more Excel functions.\n\n5\n00:00:19.886 --> 00:00:22.205\nYeah, we're talking about\nmore Excel functions.\n\n6\n00:00:22.205 --> 00:00:23.425\nActually, in these episode,\n\n7\n00:00:23.425 --> 00:00:26.825\nwe're gonna be talking about keyboard\nshortcuts that are used for functions.\n\n8\n00:00:26.825 --> 00:00:30.175\nAnd when I say we, I'm not actually\ngonna do a lot of talking.\n\n9\n00:00:30.175 --> 00:00:32.795\nWe have someone who knows all about them,\nMiss VonneSmith.\n\n10\n00:00:32.795 --> 00:00:34.935\nHow you doing today, Vonne?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic.\n\n11\n00:00:34.935 --> 00:00:38.060\nAnd yourself?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic as well, and\n\n12\n00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.608\nyou know I do love a good\nkeyboard shortcut.\n\n13\n00:00:40.608 --> 00:00:45.764\nI like to play this game where I'm gonna\nuse the mouse as little as possible,\n\n14\n00:00:45.764 --> 00:00:46.590\nright?\n\n15\n00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.623\nAnd the reason I do that, if you had\na desk every day like us, it doesn't seem\n\n16\n00:00:50.623 --> 00:00:54.548\nlike a lot, but this repetitive motion,\nit turns my shoulder into mush.\n\n17\n00:00:54.548 --> 00:00:56.410\nIt hurts.\n\n18\n00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.150\nSo I've got to where, as much as I can,\nmy hands are on the keyboard.\n\n19\n00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.250\nI'm not moving them.\n\n20\n00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.950\nSo I'm kind of interested,\n\n21\n00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.813\nwhat keyboard shortcuts are we learning?\n&gt;&gt; Well, actually, I don't have that many.\n\n22\n00:01:05.813 --> 00:01:07.660\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n23\n00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.280\n&gt;&gt; But this is really\n\n24\n00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.840\njust shortcuts in general.\n\n25\n00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.150\nSo that's why I wanted to go ahead and\nbring in yes, keyboard shortcuts,\n\n26\n00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.200\ncuz yes, I do have quite a few of them.\n\n27\n00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.310\nThey're gonna help you.\n\n28\n00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.720\nNow we're talking about keyboard shortcuts\nthat are specific for functions, okay?\n\n29\n00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.400\nThere are a lot of keyboard\nshortcuts out there,\n\n30\n00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.110\nlike Ctrl+S, for save, or\nCmd+S, if you're on a Mac.\n\n31\n00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.960\nSo this is one to go from both platforms,\nokay?\n\n32\n00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.140\nIf I did Cmd+A or Ctrl+A,\nthat would be select all.\n\n33\n00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.310\nThere's tons and tons of shortcuts.\n\n34\n00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.700\nAnd you can go ahead and find them, and\n\n35\n00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.410\nI believe we talk about that in\nthe Excel Essentials episodes, or\n\n36\n00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.530\nat least in the beginning\nwhere you can go ahead and\n\n37\n00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.140\nreference them and\nfind them online, lots of them.\n\n38\n00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.230\nLike Justin's saying,\n\n39\n00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.910\nif you have something that you do all\nthe time, find the shortcut for it and\n\n40\n00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.630\nstart just mapping your brain to do that,\nand it will make you more efficient.\n\n41\n00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.150\nYeah, like he's saying, it doesn't seem\nlike a lot, but you add that all up after\n\n42\n00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.330\na week or a month, and\nyou could be saving a lot of time.\n\n43\n00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.390\nSo things that I want to\nshow about functions.\n\n44\n00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.780\nThere's three main sections that we're\ngonna cover, is how to copy things.\n\n45\n00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.630\nCopy, really?\n\n46\n00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.130\nYes, copy and fill the functions.\n\n47\n00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.730\nThere's a couple cute little things I\nwant to show you now in one episode.\n\n48\n00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.450\nI sprinkle them all\nthroughout these episodes.\n\n49\n00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.098\nSo you'll see them again, but\nthis is just one stop shop for everything.\n\n50\n00:02:34.098 --> 00:02:36.460\nWe're also gonna talk about\nabsolute references and\n\n51\n00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.170\nwe're gonna talk about copy and\npasting as values.\n\n52\n00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.065\nOkay, so why don't we get started?\n\n53\n00:02:42.065 --> 00:02:44.550\nWe have a file called Shortcuts.\n\n54\n00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.280\nI am on the PC, so\n\n55\n00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.389\non a Mac I will tell you specifically when\nit's different or when they are the same.\n\n56\n00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:53.920\nSo let's look at this.\n\n57\n00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.880\nI want to go ahead and add up.\n\n58\n00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.890\nSo we're gonna do the Autosum.\n\n59\n00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.030\nSo we'll click the Autosum.\n\n60\n00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.170\nWe wanna make sure we just\nget those particular cells.\n\n61\n00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.060\nAnd there we go.\n\n62\n00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:11.350\nSo once I found one, I want to copy\nthe function down through all of these.\n\n63\n00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.430\nSo we, white box, we select it.\n\n64\n00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.360\nYou get the little black plus.\n\n65\n00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.620\nThat is the fill handle because the fill\nhandle's primary job is to copy, so\n\n66\n00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.700\nyou click, hold, and drag down.\n\n67\n00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.739\nUsing relative reference,\nthat's gonna go ahead and\n\n68\n00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:34.020\nupdate the values because now this\ngoes down to B6, 7, 8, and 9.\n\n69\n00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.330\nRelative reference, we covered all\nof this in our basic functions.\n\n70\n00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.930\nBut nothing shortcut about that, but\n\n71\n00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.050\nthere are some other\nthings that you can do.\n\n72\n00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.665\nFor example, let me show you\nanother one with the average and\n\n73\n00:03:47.665 --> 00:03:50.342\nthen I'll show you the fun\nshortcut that I'm talking about.\n\n74\n00:03:50.342 --> 00:03:54.790\nSo let's go ahead and\nfind the average of our functions.\n\n75\n00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.400\nAnd again more explanations\nabout these in the episodes.\n\n76\n00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.050\nOkay, so this is the one where\nI now want to fill it down.\n\n77\n00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.360\nNotice this one right here\nis next to another range\n\n78\n00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.860\nof information, whether it's functions or\nit was the actual values themselves.\n\n79\n00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.814\nInstead of single-click or\nsingle-click, hold, and drag down,\n\n80\n00:04:16.814 --> 00:04:21.420\nyou can automatically make it populate\ndown or fill down by double-clicking.\n\n81\n00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.099\nIf you just go,\n[SOUND] then it goes ahead.\n\n82\n00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:25.310\nThat's pretty slick.\n\n83\n00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.150\nI really like that.\n\n84\n00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.720\nSo it's gonna go ahead and\nfind all of that.\n\n85\n00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.360\nJust a quick backup, if you're like,\nwell, why didn't you just go ahead and\n\n86\n00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.720\ndo this one here?\n\n87\n00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.130\nWell, watch, if I take this and\ndouble-click, I'm clicking,\n\n88\n00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.420\nit's not doing anything.\n\n89\n00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.332\nThe reason why, it's too far away.\n\n90\n00:04:42.332 --> 00:04:49.570\nOkay, if I took this and moved it over to\nhere, now it's next to the information.\n\n91\n00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.500\nNow it will see,\nI get something next to it?\n\n92\n00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.320\nI'm just going to keep on copying or\n\n93\n00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:01.220\nfilling down until I see\nwhere the stop is for\n\n94\n00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:07.050\nthe range next to me, and then I'll\ngo ahead and not fill down anymore.\n\n95\n00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.630\nI like that.\n\n96\n00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.310\nSo double-clicking to go ahead and\nfill down.\n\n97\n00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.880\nLet's go across, okay?\n\n98\n00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.560\nThere's one other one I forgot to\nshow you, but I'll come back around.\n\n99\n00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.262\nSo let's come into here because now you're\nlike, I really love this double-click.\n\n100\n00:05:19.262 --> 00:05:21.390\nI'm gonna go ahead and\njust do it all the time, right?\n\n101\n00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.686\nAnd then you do this and, what, what?\n\n102\n00:05:24.686 --> 00:05:26.120\nIt only goes down.\n\n103\n00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.730\nIt does not go across.\n\n104\n00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.780\nIf you want to go across,\nyou're gonna have to click, hold and\n\n105\n00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.180\ndrag all the way across.\n\n106\n00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.250\nNow that being said,\nyou're like is that the only way?\n\n107\n00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:44.210\nNo, and that's where I kinda wanna\nbacktrack just a little bit,\n\n108\n00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.690\ncome back over to here, because there\nis another way of filling down.\n\n109\n00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.580\nIt's like reverse.\n\n110\n00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:58.490\nYou select, so I did the first one, so you\ndo have to have one completed function.\n\n111\n00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.200\nIf you click, hold, and drag down,\nyou select the range first and\n\n112\n00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:10.010\nthen you do Ctrl+D for down,\nwould be Cmd+D in a Mac,\n\n113\n00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:14.210\nit will copy down or fill down.\n\n114\n00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.310\nThe same would be for this.\n\n115\n00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.607\nIf I'm going D for down,\nJustin, I'm gonna call on you.\n\n116\n00:06:21.607 --> 00:06:23.600\nHow do you think I'm\ngonna go to the right?\n\n117\n00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:25.810\n&gt;&gt; R for right?\n\n118\n00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.885\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH] there you go.\n\n119\n00:06:27.885 --> 00:06:33.826\nCtrl+R, and it goes across,\nsame for Cmd+R in Mac.\n\n120\n00:06:33.826 --> 00:06:37.490\nSo there's some other ways that\nyou can go across or down.\n\n121\n00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.460\nSo just different ways\nof how to fill down or\n\n122\n00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:46.525\ncopying your functions from one place\nto another, and kind of some fun stuff.\n\n123\n00:06:47.935 --> 00:06:49.445\nAbsolute reference, okay?\n\n124\n00:06:49.445 --> 00:06:53.975\nFull disclosure, I am filming this episode\nafter I filmed quite a few episodes that\n\n125\n00:06:53.975 --> 00:06:55.606\nare in the function library.\n\n126\n00:06:55.606 --> 00:07:01.995\n[LAUGH] And you will see me struggle with\ntyping in the dollar signs in there.\n\n127\n00:07:01.995 --> 00:07:05.867\nAnd you'll hear me say, I don't have\na keyboard that has a function key.\n\n128\n00:07:05.867 --> 00:07:07.507\n[LAUGH] Another full disclosure.\n\n129\n00:07:07.507 --> 00:07:12.692\n[LAUGH] I found out how my touch bar on\nmy Macintosh computer can go ahead and\n\n130\n00:07:12.692 --> 00:07:14.290\nshow function keys.\n\n131\n00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:18.580\nAnd then how I can also do that in my\nvirtual machine that's running Windows.\n\n132\n00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.760\nAnd now I have function\nkeys across the top.\n\n133\n00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:26.020\nAnd I'm [LAUGH] sitting here going\nlike why didn't I do this before?\n\n134\n00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.750\nSo hey, just letting you know.\n\n135\n00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:29.500\nI'm human.\n\n136\n00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.930\nSo I wanted to show you how\nyou can use the F4 key.\n\n137\n00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.550\nIt's really, really handy.\n\n138\n00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:37.110\nI use it all the time.\n\n139\n00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.660\nWell, I use it all the time\nwhen I have the key, and\n\n140\n00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.540\nthen figure out how I can\nget my function keys back.\n\n141\n00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.840\nSo if I was going to do the commission.\n\n142\n00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.838\nThe commission would be the sales\ntimes the commission rate,\n\n143\n00:07:47.838 --> 00:07:49.695\nwhich is 10% that's in this cell.\n\n144\n00:07:49.695 --> 00:07:58.083\nSo if I said, =, a very simple\nformula of this cell times this cell.\n\n145\n00:07:58.083 --> 00:07:59.897\nThink you've seen from our other episodes.\n\n146\n00:07:59.897 --> 00:08:02.800\nIf you haven't watched them,\ngo back and watch the basic functions.\n\n147\n00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.920\nIf I hit Enter and then say, yay,\nlet go ahead and copy this down.\n\n148\n00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.930\nLet's do the double click, and it breaks,\nbecause of absolute reference.\n\n149\n00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:15.320\nWe need to say, relatively move\ndown as I copy for my sales.\n\n150\n00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:20.930\nBut always times it back by this cell,\nI need it fixed in its position.\n\n151\n00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:25.390\nSo if I come back into this formula,\n\n152\n00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:30.430\nand edit it, my cursor, notice that\nmy cursor is at the backside of F2.\n\n153\n00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:34.590\nThat's the cell reference,\nby the way, okay, I just so\n\n154\n00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:35.990\nhappened to put it in the column F.\n\n155\n00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:40.790\nWhen I go here,\nI hit the F4 key on my keyboard.\n\n156\n00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:44.750\nAnd it automatically puts in\nthe dollar signs in front\n\n157\n00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:49.262\nof the column reference and\nthe row reference.\n\n158\n00:08:49.262 --> 00:08:55.290\nNice, so I could just have said,\nclick B2 times F2 and\n\n159\n00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:59.250\nhit F4 right away, and\nit would have done the absolute reference.\n\n160\n00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.780\nThe other thing to know is that you\ncan cycle through your references.\n\n161\n00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:07.530\nCuz sometimes you want to fix the column\nreference and not the row reference,\n\n162\n00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:10.810\nor other way around,\nthere's use case scenarios for that.\n\n163\n00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:16.120\nSo if I click the F4 again,\nnotice it cycles to just do the row,\n\n164\n00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:21.110\ndo it again, just the column, do it again,\ntakes the absolute reference off.\n\n165\n00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:23.050\nClick it again,\nputs them in front of both of them.\n\n166\n00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:28.172\nSo you sit there and cycle through to add\nthose dollar signs to fix that particular\n\n167\n00:09:28.172 --> 00:09:31.476\nreference, and that's pretty cool.\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne,\n\n168\n00:09:31.476 --> 00:09:32.960\nI'm gonna be honest with you.\n\n169\n00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.080\nI know you've said this before, and\nI just kind of thought of it in passing,\n\n170\n00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.910\nwe've been together for a few episodes.\n\n171\n00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.180\nThis is something that when I'm in Excel,\n\n172\n00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.870\nI almost always have at least\none absolute reference.\n\n173\n00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.570\nThis would save me so much time,\n\n174\n00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:50.020\nI just learned this,\nI didn't know this would work.\n\n175\n00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:50.710\nBut I'll tell you what,\n\n176\n00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:56.280\nI'm gonna make sure my touch bar's got\nfunction keys on them when I'm in Excel.\n\n177\n00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.696\nBecause typing those dollar signs\ndoesn't seem like a huge deal,\n\n178\n00:09:59.696 --> 00:10:01.408\nuntil you go to have to type them.\n\n179\n00:10:01.408 --> 00:10:03.559\nOr you forget and you're like,\nI gotta do that again,\n\n180\n00:10:03.559 --> 00:10:05.280\nand it's bad.\n&gt;&gt; And yeah,\n\n181\n00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.420\nyou guys are gonna watch me [LAUGH]\nlike I'm in the wrong space.\n\n182\n00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:10.622\nAnd I put my cursor in the wrong way and\nyou're like [SOUND].\n\n183\n00:10:10.622 --> 00:10:17.602\nSo yeah, I will demonstrate in quite a few\nof these episodes why this is so handy.\n\n184\n00:10:17.602 --> 00:10:21.876\nSo definitely use it, and\nthen once I hit Enter, copy this down,\n\n185\n00:10:21.876 --> 00:10:24.900\nI have an absolute reference, yeah.\n\n186\n00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:28.086\nWhen I first learned about this,\nI'm like, okay, that's fine,\n\n187\n00:10:28.086 --> 00:10:29.242\nI use it all the time too.\n\n188\n00:10:29.242 --> 00:10:34.170\nThere's always, I need you to always go\nback and fix this particular value within\n\n189\n00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:38.530\nour calculations, big deal,\nF4 will be your friend.\n\n190\n00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:43.350\nNow the other things that we do\na lot in here, especially when\n\n191\n00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:47.990\nwe're working with text, is that you're\ngonna need to paste those values.\n\n192\n00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:52.230\nBecause this function right here,\nthis isn't anything fancy.\n\n193\n00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:55.060\nI just concatenated these\ntogether with the ampersand,\n\n194\n00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:56.530\ndefinitely check that episode out.\n\n195\n00:10:56.530 --> 00:11:00.910\nWhere I wanted to bring out the first\nname and the last name, and\n\n196\n00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:03.030\nput them together in one cell.\n\n197\n00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.550\nSo it says Alice Wonderpaws and\nBishop Smith.\n\n198\n00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:07.980\nWell, that's great, but\n\n199\n00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:13.520\nthis isn't text right now, this is\nthe result of a formula or a function.\n\n200\n00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:18.090\nSo when I take this, and I select it,\nand I copy it, I'll right click for fun,\n\n201\n00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:18.950\nand we copy.\n\n202\n00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:22.310\nAnd then we come over\nhere to another location,\n\n203\n00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:25.800\nand maybe the same worksheet,\nmaybe another worksheet.\n\n204\n00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:31.340\nAnd then I just do a regular paste,\nit's gonna go, no, that doesn't work, why?\n\n205\n00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:35.950\nBecause it's trying to reference these\ncells that were in the original,\n\n206\n00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:37.410\ntrying to use relative reference.\n\n207\n00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:41.960\nBut it's like, wait, I'm already in\ncolumn A, I don't understand, okay.\n\n208\n00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:46.450\nOr you might get some weird results of,\nlet's go ahead and paste it here and\n\n209\n00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:51.310\nnow you're getting, wait, what,\ncuz it's relatively moving.\n\n210\n00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:56.500\nThat's the whole idea about copying and\npasting functions.\n\n211\n00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:01.030\nIt's going to use that relative reference,\nso I can't do that.\n\n212\n00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:06.628\nI don't want to do the function,\nI want the values.\n\n213\n00:12:06.628 --> 00:12:09.650\nNow, I 'm going to undo\nthis one more time.\n\n214\n00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:12.400\nIt's still copied,\nbecause it has the running ants around it.\n\n215\n00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:17.480\nIf I was coming down here to paste it,\nbefore I paste or\n\n216\n00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.860\nactually click the button,\nI could come into the right click.\n\n217\n00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:26.130\nAnd if I hover over those paste options,\nit's paste as values,\n\n218\n00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:29.320\nnot functions, so I could do it this way.\n\n219\n00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:35.030\nI could have also pasted and\nthen gone down to the paste options,\n\n220\n00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:39.110\nlittle smart tab down at the bottom,\nand then changed it from here.\n\n221\n00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:44.100\nI could have just gone to here,\nthere's always a whole bunch\n\n222\n00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.710\nof ways to find the paste,\nI could paste the values that way.\n\n223\n00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:50.450\nSo just understand the concept,\nthat's the biggest part.\n\n224\n00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:54.670\nAnd then two, which method of bringing it\n\n225\n00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:59.880\nin as values that makes the most sense to\nyou is the way that you like it, so yeah.\n\n226\n00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.680\nRight click, click the button, but\n\n227\n00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:09.100\nthen there's probably one of my favorites,\nnow, that I like to do.\n\n228\n00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.650\nAnd this is where a lot of times,\nI just wanna paste and\n\n229\n00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:16.810\nplace, I don't even wanna put it\nsomewhere else, I just want the values.\n\n230\n00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:20.400\nSo yes, copy paste right on top of it,\nor you could do this.\n\n231\n00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:24.410\nYou select it, you're gonna use your\nright-click mouse, I have a magic mouse,\n\n232\n00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:25.930\nbut it's still a right click.\n\n233\n00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:31.848\nOkay, so if I hold the right key,\nclick, hold, drag it over,\n\n234\n00:13:31.848 --> 00:13:36.554\nand then drag it back and\nlet go of the right click.\n\n235\n00:13:36.554 --> 00:13:41.562\nWhat it does, cuz anytime you right-click\ndrag in a PC, or this still works on Macs,\n\n236\n00:13:41.562 --> 00:13:45.960\nthis is not just a PC thing, it's always\ngonna give you a contextual menu.\n\n237\n00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:49.600\nSo there's some tricks that\nyou can right-click drag for\n\n238\n00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:54.130\nfiles on your desktop or what have you to\nmake copies of them, so it's kind of fun.\n\n239\n00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:55.380\nSo now it's like, okay, well,\n\n240\n00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:59.960\ndo you wanna copy here,\nsince I let go of it, as values?\n\n241\n00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:04.246\nYeah I can, and I've got it right\nlike that, so it's kind of fun.\n\n242\n00:14:04.246 --> 00:14:07.340\nRight-click drab, drab, [LAUGH] drag.\n\n243\n00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:11.820\nI always like the cute way of doing\nthings, just cuz, I don't know,\n\n244\n00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:12.520\nI like cute things.\n\n245\n00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.490\nSo maybe you'll find it cute,\nyou can do it that way too, so.\n\n246\n00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:17.480\n&gt;&gt; I will tell you,\n\n247\n00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:22.000\nI typically avoid right-click and\ndragging anything, but I don't know why.\n\n248\n00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.630\nWhy I have this aversion to,\nit's a right-click I shouldn't drag.\n\n249\n00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:29.500\nI always think of it as a left click,\nbut context menus,\n\n250\n00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.860\nthey can be super helpful.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n251\n00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:37.756\nthen, another full disclosure,\nI just recently started doing this method.\n\n252\n00:14:37.756 --> 00:14:43.125\nWell, that's cute, yeah,\nI've always just pasted in place and\n\n253\n00:14:43.125 --> 00:14:47.450\nused the smart tabs, or\njust the actual button on the home tab.\n\n254\n00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:50.030\nSo it's just kinda mixing\nit up a little bit,\n\n255\n00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:52.270\nit's my flavor of the month right now.\n\n256\n00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:56.700\nAnd so I'm happy with it, so I wanted to\npass that along to you as different ways\n\n257\n00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.200\nthat you can do some shortcuts.\n\n258\n00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:03.080\nWhoops, sorry, went a little to far,\njust trying to get it in our frame.\n\n259\n00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.540\nThere's another one that, honestly,\n\n260\n00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:09.670\nI looked this up while I was going through\nthe list of shortcuts in the help files,\n\n261\n00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:15.850\njust support.microsoft.com\nof Excel keyboard shortcuts.\n\n262\n00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:18.102\nI found some and I'm like,\nthat's kinda handy.\n\n263\n00:15:18.102 --> 00:15:24.560\nOkay, so\nyou can paste as value from cell above.\n\n264\n00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:30.690\nFor example, this one right\nhere I have the sum of these.\n\n265\n00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:37.760\nMaybe I just want this number 23 as 23,\njust because, and I wanted it right here.\n\n266\n00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:41.128\nIf you're in the cell, so you have to\nselect the cell that you want it to go,\n\n267\n00:15:41.128 --> 00:15:42.684\nit's the one directly above you.\n\n268\n00:15:42.684 --> 00:15:47.781\nIf you hold your Ctrl+Shift and the quote,\n\n269\n00:15:47.781 --> 00:15:52.738\nokay, the one by the Enter and Return key,\n\n270\n00:15:52.738 --> 00:15:57.441\nit will paste that cell above as a value.\n\n271\n00:15:57.441 --> 00:15:58.962\nOo, okay.\n\n272\n00:15:58.962 --> 00:16:02.380\nI've seen this done in programs\nwhere it's like, okay,\n\n273\n00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:05.186\nhere's the result of the formula or\nfunction.\n\n274\n00:16:05.186 --> 00:16:08.970\nAnd this is whatever that is as\nthe value and then you use that.\n\n275\n00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:12.152\nSo you keep this as your function or\nformula,\n\n276\n00:16:12.152 --> 00:16:14.929\nand this just needs to be a fixed value.\n\n277\n00:16:14.929 --> 00:16:16.797\nSo, okay, kinda cute.\n\n278\n00:16:16.797 --> 00:16:19.282\nYou have a very puzzling look over there,\nJustin.\n\n279\n00:16:19.282 --> 00:16:21.241\nI'm a little wondering\nwhat's going through that.\n\n280\n00:16:21.241 --> 00:16:21.890\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n281\n00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:24.590\nI can see where this is applicable here.\n\n282\n00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:27.720\nI'm trying to think of an alternative\nsituation where I would be like,\n\n283\n00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.990\nI want just the thing above where\nI am [LAUGH] to be copied down.\n\n284\n00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:34.530\nBut I'm sure it's a common pattern.\n\n285\n00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:38.210\nIt's just not something that I do.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I can see if\n\n286\n00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:42.870\nI need to keep in its formula body,\nif you wanna say.\n\n287\n00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:49.520\nAnd I also need it in its value body,\nand I use it for different ways.\n\n288\n00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.350\nI can see it.\n\n289\n00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:54.480\nWould I always set my stuff up this way?\n\n290\n00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:58.255\nMaybe not, but I thought it was cute,\nso I wanted to pass it along.\n\n291\n00:16:58.255 --> 00:16:59.920\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just out of curiousity,\n\n292\n00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.839\nwhat if we had a whole column, we had it\nhighlighted and we did that same exact\n\n293\n00:17:03.839 --> 00:17:07.855\nkeyboard shortcut, what happens?\n&gt;&gt; If you wanted all of them to-\n\n294\n00:17:07.855 --> 00:17:09.556\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so like-\n\n295\n00:17:09.556 --> 00:17:10.316\n&gt;&gt; So-\n\n296\n00:17:10.316 --> 00:17:12.225\n&gt;&gt; So are all of these formulas?\n\n297\n00:17:12.225 --> 00:17:13.340\n&gt;&gt; So-\n\n298\n00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:14.840\n&gt;&gt; I guess it doesn't matter.\n\n299\n00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:17.500\n&gt;&gt; Oo, sorry, let's copy.\n\n300\n00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:21.110\nI think I know what you're saying,\nbut let's find out.\n\n301\n00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:23.940\nSo if I did just like more values across,\n\n302\n00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:26.950\nthese are my results.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n303\n00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:28.040\n&gt;&gt; Are you saying now you want\n\n304\n00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:31.520\nall of these to be values?\n&gt;&gt; So that but\n\n305\n00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.650\nalso, I have another question.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n306\n00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:35.600\n&gt;&gt; Let's try that first.\n\n307\n00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.840\n&gt;&gt; Okay, cuz these are all functions.\n\n308\n00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:45.540\nSo if I selected these and did Ctrl+Shift,\nit looks like it's just one.\n\n309\n00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.420\nIt didn't want to do all of them.\n\n310\n00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:52.109\nIt looks like it's a single instance,\nfrom what I can see.\n\n311\n00:17:52.109 --> 00:17:54.475\n&gt;&gt; Okay, what if we had a column and\n\n312\n00:17:54.475 --> 00:17:57.464\nwe highlighted a column and then hid it.\n\n313\n00:17:57.464 --> 00:18:02.670\nDoes it mess stuff up, or\nwhat I have highlighted above,\n\n314\n00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:06.390\ndoes it bring down below?\n&gt;&gt; If these were all\n\n315\n00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:07.199\nfunctions?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n316\n00:18:07.199 --> 00:18:09.060\nlet's just say those are highlighted.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so let's come over here.\n\n317\n00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.990\nThese are functions.\n&gt;&gt; They were.\n\n318\n00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:13.730\n&gt;&gt; Or they were.\n\n319\n00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:14.890\nOkay, they were.\n\n320\n00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:16.720\nSo let's do it really quickly.\n\n321\n00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:21.636\nSo let's take this, and\nwe'll say equals this plus this.\n\n322\n00:18:21.636 --> 00:18:23.274\nJust for fun, and then we'll,\n\n323\n00:18:23.274 --> 00:18:25.465\ndon't worry about the space, like that.\n\n324\n00:18:25.465 --> 00:18:27.140\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n325\n00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:28.650\n&gt;&gt; So now they're highlighted.\n\n326\n00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:32.968\nWhat if I hold Ctrl+Shift and\nhit that quote?\n\n327\n00:18:32.968 --> 00:18:34.587\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no.\n\n328\n00:18:34.587 --> 00:18:35.876\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n329\n00:18:35.876 --> 00:18:39.360\nI was trying to figure out a way around\nthe system, but that looks like it might\n\n330\n00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.771\nbreak a bunch of stuff.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n331\n00:18:40.771 --> 00:18:43.768\nI don't think that you can find\na way to break this one, Justin.\n\n332\n00:18:43.768 --> 00:18:45.029\nIt is exactly like,\n\n333\n00:18:45.029 --> 00:18:49.718\nI will only copy the value above the cell\nthat you are selected in as a value.\n\n334\n00:18:49.718 --> 00:18:51.578\nThat's it, done.\n\n335\n00:18:51.578 --> 00:18:56.452\nBut it has to be directly above it,\nbecause if I'm like out here and\n\n336\n00:18:56.452 --> 00:19:00.032\nthen I did Ctrl+Shift quote,\nit's like, no.\n\n337\n00:19:00.032 --> 00:19:01.693\nI don't know what you're doing.\n\n338\n00:19:01.693 --> 00:19:04.280\nAnd on a Mac, it is Control.\n\n339\n00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:05.790\nIt is not Command.\n\n340\n00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:08.740\nIt's not Cmd+Shift, it is Ctrl+Shift.\n\n341\n00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:10.960\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n342\n00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:14.870\nSo all right,\nyou didn't break me there, Justin.\n\n343\n00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:17.840\nOr at least Excel helped\nme not break you there.\n\n344\n00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.526\nAgain, use case scenarios as\nto why you wanna do this.\n\n345\n00:19:20.526 --> 00:19:25.600\nAnd honestly, the last one I have is\njust that if you wanted to make this\n\n346\n00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:31.362\nparticular formula bar a little bit\nbigger, especially when you start getting\n\n347\n00:19:31.362 --> 00:19:36.618\ninto really long, complicated formulas,\nyou can do Ctrl+Shift+U.\n\n348\n00:19:36.618 --> 00:19:41.422\nAnd do you see how it automatically\nmade the formula bar just a little bit\n\n349\n00:19:41.422 --> 00:19:43.918\nbigger and wider so you can see more?\n\n350\n00:19:43.918 --> 00:19:45.899\nAnd you do Ctrl+Shift+U.\n\n351\n00:19:45.899 --> 00:19:50.007\nAgain, on the Mac,\nit is Control, not Command.\n\n352\n00:19:50.007 --> 00:19:52.620\nAnd then it just goes ahead and\nextends it out a little bit.\n\n353\n00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:55.850\nSo making the formula bar\njust a little bit bigger.\n\n354\n00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:58.775\nSo again, just a few shortcuts for\nyou guys.\n\n355\n00:19:58.775 --> 00:19:59.963\nI find them helpful.\n\n356\n00:19:59.963 --> 00:20:03.519\nAnd I wanted to put them all in one place,\njust in case when you go through\n\n357\n00:20:03.519 --> 00:20:06.544\neverything and you maybe see me\ndo it one way in one episode and\n\n358\n00:20:06.544 --> 00:20:08.860\nanother way in another episode.\n\n359\n00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:12.270\nThat's why I went ahead and\nput them all together, after I've done\n\n360\n00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:16.510\nquite a few of them, and I learned how\nto do the function keys on my Mac.\n\n361\n00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:19.000\nCheck out the functions in Mac episode.\n\n362\n00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.474\nIt's in your System Preferences.\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, Vonne,\n\n363\n00:20:21.474 --> 00:20:24.064\nI'll tell you what, you gave us\na bunch of keyboard shortcuts and\n\n364\n00:20:24.064 --> 00:20:27.287\nyou gave us a few other shortcuts that'll\njust help increase our productivity.\n\n365\n00:20:27.287 --> 00:20:29.830\nSo we had a little added bonus there.\n\n366\n00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:31.197\nSo thank you so much for that.\n\n367\n00:20:31.197 --> 00:20:32.532\nAnd thank you for joining us.\n\n368\n00:20:32.532 --> 00:20:34.860\nThese are going to be very helpful to you.\n\n369\n00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:37.075\nBut speaking of being helpful,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n370\n00:20:37.075 --> 00:20:38.284\nhelp ourselves on out of here.\n\n371\n00:20:38.284 --> 00:20:41.109\nSo signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n372\n00:20:41.109 --> 00:20:41.857\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n373\n00:20:41.857 --> 00:20:43.749\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n374\n00:20:43.749 --> 00:20:49.244\n[SOUND]\n\n",

It's fantastically,\nfanatically great, I don't know,\n\n10\n00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.001\n[LAUGH] I don't know where that came from.\n\n11\n00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:37.012\n&gt;&gt; Today is the best and\nno other day is any better [LAUGH].\n\n12\n00:00:37.012 --> 00:00:39.903\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, I just tried to\nput some f-words together, but\n\n13\n00:00:39.903 --> 00:00:41.912\nit didn't really work very well at all.\n\n14\n00:00:41.912 --> 00:00:43.654\n&gt;&gt; This is going downhill quick, Vonne.\n\n15\n00:00:43.654 --> 00:00:46.354\n&gt;&gt; It is, and we should move on to,\nwhat are we talking about,\n\n16\n00:00:46.354 --> 00:00:48.034\nwe're talking about named ranges.\n\n17\n00:00:48.034 --> 00:00:52.700\nYes, so much fun with these, and what\nis a named range, why would we use it?\n\n18\n00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.230\nWe're gonna go ahead and demonstrate\nthese concepts as we go through.\n\n19\n00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.412\nBut the whole idea is that you\nare gonna be naming a range of cells,\n\n20\n00:01:00.412 --> 00:01:04.003\nthere you go, definition within the topic.\n\n21\n00:01:04.003 --> 00:01:05.323\n&gt;&gt; Shortest episode ever.\n\n22\n00:01:05.323 --> 00:01:10.123\n&gt;&gt; Right, [LAUGH] so instead of saying,\nI need a range of cells, C2 through C5.\n\n23\n00:01:10.123 --> 00:01:15.510\nWell, those C2 through C5,\nthey mean something to you,\n\n24\n00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.660\nthey have some type of label, or\nthose are my quarter one sales.\n\n25\n00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.746\n&gt;&gt; Sales totals, or whatever,\nI can just name that Sales Totals.\n\n26\n00:01:23.746 --> 00:01:28.522\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, those are my January sales,\nso just name them January Sales.\n\n27\n00:01:28.522 --> 00:01:33.203\nAnd that way, you could use those named\nranges to be able to navigate to those\n\n28\n00:01:33.203 --> 00:01:36.582\nparticular areas,\nthose particular range of cells.\n\n29\n00:01:36.582 --> 00:01:39.642\nOr even better,\nsince this is an Excel function series,\n\n30\n00:01:39.642 --> 00:01:42.974\nyou can use them in functions,\nthat's what we're gonna do.\n\n31\n00:01:42.974 --> 00:01:45.732\n&gt;&gt; I would never have guessed that's\nwhat we were gonna do [LAUGH].\n\n32\n00:01:45.732 --> 00:01:48.608\n&gt;&gt; I know, it's very misleading,\nso [LAUGH].\n\n33\n00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:50.663\n&gt;&gt; Actually,\nwe're gonna make pie with them.\n\n34\n00:01:50.663 --> 00:01:53.001\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Pie, why is it always food?\n\n35\n00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:58.360\n&gt;&gt; It's for a foodie, that's why,\nwe have a problem, okay [LAUGH]?\n\n36\n00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.608\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna at least go to\npizza once in this episode.\n\n37\n00:02:01.608 --> 00:02:02.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, at least one good [CROSSTALK].\n\n38\n00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.806\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we go ahead and\nslice on, put it on a pizza,\n\n39\n00:02:05.806 --> 00:02:08.580\nlet's go ahead and slice on down here.\n\n40\n00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.320\nOkay, so\nwe have our file called named ranges, and\n\n41\n00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.640\nI just have a couple worksheets\nin here to go ahead and\n\n42\n00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.210\ngive us some examples of what\nwe can do with named ranges.\n\n43\n00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.890\nNow, we have actually covered\nthis in some other episodes,\n\n44\n00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.500\nit's kinda sprinkled all in through there.\n\n45\n00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.740\nI believe we did it in the essentials,\nactually, I can't even remember where\n\n46\n00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.270\nwe've done it, I just know I've said\nit a couple times in different places.\n\n47\n00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.320\nSo this is where we're going to\nbe using them within functions.\n\n48\n00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.240\nSo here we have our sales totals, we have\nour south sales and our north sales.\n\n49\n00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.904\nCool, now, I could go ahead if I wanted\nto add up the north and south totals.\n\n50\n00:02:47.904 --> 00:02:51.360\nJust normal, I could just go ahead and\ndo it remember auto sum?\n\n51\n00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.516\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Our fun little auto sum,\n\n52\n00:02:53.516 --> 00:02:56.511\nlet's go ahead and sum up these numbers.\n\n53\n00:02:56.511 --> 00:03:00.790\nAnd then we have to hold the Ctrl key cuz\nwe want another range, hold down Ctrl, and\n\n54\n00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:01.672\nthese numbers.\n\n55\n00:03:01.672 --> 00:03:06.510\nSo add up the south sales,\nadd up the north sales, we go ahead and\n\n56\n00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.680\nget our result of $257.\n\n57\n00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.130\nBut the thing is,\nthis function right here, or formula,\n\n58\n00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.540\nwhichever way you wanna say it,\nit's just B4.\n\n59\n00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.840\nIf I was looking at this without having\nany knowledge of what's going on,\n\n60\n00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.350\nthose are cells, they're just,\nI don't know what those cells mean.\n\n61\n00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.792\nSo, but if I can actually have\nsomething in our function that says,\n\n62\n00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:33.101\nnorth sales, and south sales,\nit makes more sense.\n\n63\n00:03:33.101 --> 00:03:35.983\nSo it's really just kind of\ngiving like a human element.\n\n64\n00:03:35.983 --> 00:03:39.242\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, some readability,\nalmost, to the formula.\n\n65\n00:03:39.242 --> 00:03:45.433\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just what it means to you, that's\nwhat the benefit of using name range is.\n\n66\n00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:51.090\nSo let's go ahead and delete that,\nand how do I name a range?\n\n67\n00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.600\nThere's a couple of ways, and\n\n68\n00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.981\nwe're gonna go through all\nthe different examples in this episode.\n\n69\n00:03:55.981 --> 00:04:01.206\nSo let's start with the first way,\nlet's select our south sales.\n\n70\n00:04:01.206 --> 00:04:07.390\nNow in our Excel environment,\nwe have up here, this is our name box.\n\n71\n00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.570\nNow this name box just goes ahead and\ntells you where you're at.\n\n72\n00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.970\nSince I'm in a range,\n\n73\n00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.930\nit's only gonna give me the first one\nthat's selected within the range.\n\n74\n00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.600\nCuz if I click here or here,\nnotice that it deselects the range, but\n\n75\n00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.850\nthen it goes ahead and\ngives me that particular cell.\n\n76\n00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.770\nSo if I select these, it doesn't really\nshow B4 through B6 within the name box,\n\n77\n00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.300\nstill only that first one.\n\n78\n00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.880\nWell, how I can make this a named\nrange is actually from up here.\n\n79\n00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.880\nIf I click on this, and notice I get\na flashing cursor, it's not flashing yet,\n\n80\n00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.060\nbut I get an I beam on my mouse cursor,\nand I click it.\n\n81\n00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.700\nNow it goes ahead and highlights\nthe cells, or that's not really the cell,\n\n82\n00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.880\nthat's the cell reference within\nthe name box, there we go.\n\n83\n00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.984\nAnd I just start typing,\nif I type in South_Sales,\n\n84\n00:04:54.984 --> 00:04:59.276\nnow the way that you\nhave to accept the name,\n\n85\n00:04:59.276 --> 00:05:03.112\nyou have to hit Enter on your keyboard.\n\n86\n00:05:03.112 --> 00:05:06.444\nTo make it sure that it knows that, yes,\n\n87\n00:05:06.444 --> 00:05:12.730\nyou're confirming that this is the name\nof this particular set of cells.\n\n88\n00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.500\nAnd so now you can see that when I\nselect it, it actually says South_Sales.\n\n89\n00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.580\n&gt;&gt; Now, Vonne, really quickly,\nfor some people like me,\n\n90\n00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.740\nwhere I use Tab autocomplete a lot,\nor I Tab around pages a lot.\n\n91\n00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.780\nWhat would happen if,\ncuz I'm probably going to do it,\n\n92\n00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.283\nwhat happens if I type in a name and\nI hit Tab instead of Enter?\n\n93\n00:05:30.283 --> 00:05:33.020\n&gt;&gt; I think nowadays,\nit'll probably do it, here, let's try it.\n\n94\n00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.952\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's give it a whirl.\n\n95\n00:05:33.952 --> 00:05:37.126\n&gt;&gt; So let's go here and\nif I go north_sales, whoops,\n\n96\n00:05:37.126 --> 00:05:40.155\nlet's move that cursor out,\nso you can see that,\n\n97\n00:05:40.155 --> 00:05:44.223\nnorth_sales, and I hit the Tab,\nactually, Tab doesn't work.\n\n98\n00:05:44.223 --> 00:05:46.293\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there you go, so no,\n\n99\n00:05:46.293 --> 00:05:47.930\nit doesn't work with Tab.\n\n100\n00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.373\n&gt;&gt; Excellent.\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, now you gotta go ahead and\n\n101\n00:05:50.373 --> 00:05:53.715\nhit Enter, but\nnotice my flashing cursor's still there.\n\n102\n00:05:53.715 --> 00:05:55.534\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; If I click out of this and\n\n103\n00:05:55.534 --> 00:06:00.032\nI select this again, it doesn't get it,\nso that's what I'm saying.\n\n104\n00:06:00.032 --> 00:06:05.960\nEmphasizing the, hit the Enter key, accept\nthe name, before you click off of it.\n\n105\n00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.285\nOtherwise it's not gonna know that you\nwanna go ahead and give it that name,\n\n106\n00:06:10.285 --> 00:06:12.124\nso that's one of those things.\n\n107\n00:06:12.124 --> 00:06:14.632\nSo I'm gonna zoom out of here, and\n\n108\n00:06:14.632 --> 00:06:19.230\nI don't know if you picked up that,\nI didn't say south space.\n\n109\n00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.520\nYep, yeah, cuz you know where we're going,\nthere's naming conventions.\n\n110\n00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.995\n&gt;&gt; Yeah there are, there's always\na naming convention [LAUGH].\n\n111\n00:06:23.995 --> 00:06:26.417\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there's always rules for\nthese kinds of things,\n\n112\n00:06:26.417 --> 00:06:27.661\nso syntax rules for naming.\n\n113\n00:06:27.661 --> 00:06:30.846\nThis is a link that I got off of,\nit's in our show notes, so\n\n114\n00:06:30.846 --> 00:06:32.480\nyou could go ahead and get it.\n\n115\n00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.908\nAnd this is really just, here,\nif I scroll all the way back up,\n\n116\n00:06:35.908 --> 00:06:37.872\ndefining these names in a formula.\n\n117\n00:06:37.872 --> 00:06:42.852\nAnd so you can see that it gets to learn\nabout syntax rules for your names,\n\n118\n00:06:42.852 --> 00:06:46.720\nso it has to,\nfirst character must be a letter.\n\n119\n00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.000\nAnd an underscore character or\n\n120\n00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.070\na backslash,\nremaining characters if you can see.\n\n121\n00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:58.650\nYou cannot use the upper case and\nlower case C and R as defined names.\n\n122\n00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:03.873\nBecause they do use, and\nwe actually saw this in another\n\n123\n00:07:03.873 --> 00:07:08.776\nseries when we were linking\npieces of Excel in Word.\n\n124\n00:07:08.776 --> 00:07:13.760\nAnd where it's giving me like an R and\na C, like row and column.\n\n125\n00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.700\nHere, we're using A as a column and\n2 as a row, but\n\n126\n00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.150\ninternally, it sees them as rows and\ncolumns.\n\n127\n00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:26.140\nSo you can't say, this is going to be R25,\n\n128\n00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:30.133\nthat's not gonna, doesn't work that way.\n\n129\n00:07:30.133 --> 00:07:32.540\nAnd so\nyou can see that spaces are not allowed,\n\n130\n00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.824\nit can only be 255 characters,\nwell, that's a lot [LAUGH].\n\n131\n00:07:35.824 --> 00:07:38.977\n&gt;&gt; Man, might as well just\ngive up at this point [LAUGH].\n\n132\n00:07:38.977 --> 00:07:41.205\n&gt;&gt; The limitations [LAUGH].\n\n133\n00:07:41.205 --> 00:07:43.563\n&gt;&gt; Yes, just tie my hands, why don't you?\n\n134\n00:07:43.563 --> 00:07:47.531\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And you can see that now, it\ndoesn't say that you can't use uppercase\n\n135\n00:07:47.531 --> 00:07:49.920\nand lowercase, but it is case-sensitive.\n\n136\n00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:55.384\nSo if I named this, like for example over\nhere, remember I named this South_Sales.\n\n137\n00:07:55.384 --> 00:07:59.080\nWell, if I'm going to use this\nin a formula or go ahead and\n\n138\n00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.930\ntry to navigate to it by typing\nin lowercase south_sales,\n\n139\n00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:08.380\nIt's not going to recognize it\nbecause it does see case sensitivity.\n\n140\n00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:11.690\nSo that's something to know\nabout our naming conventions.\n\n141\n00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:14.280\nNow I told you that one way we could\ndo this is go ahead and select it and\n\n142\n00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.780\ndo it through the name box.\n\n143\n00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.530\nBut there is, of course,\nother ways, right?\n\n144\n00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:20.770\nSo if you come over here\nto your formulas tab,\n\n145\n00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:25.240\nthere's a whole group in our ribbon\nthat's called defined names.\n\n146\n00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.070\nAnd we have, a name manager.\n\n147\n00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:28.070\nAnd all these other things.\n\n148\n00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:30.893\nLet's just take a look in the name\nmanager right now while we have just\n\n149\n00:08:30.893 --> 00:08:31.990\na small amount.\n\n150\n00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:35.515\nSo you can see that it says south\nsales it gives me the values.\n\n151\n00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:40.581\nIt's giving where it's referred to you and\nyou can see that we've done this\n\n152\n00:08:40.581 --> 00:08:45.586\nin our basics that we know that this is\na sheet name is called defined names.\n\n153\n00:08:45.586 --> 00:08:50.568\nAnd that is absolutely\nreferencing B4 through B6, so\n\n154\n00:08:50.568 --> 00:08:57.460\nwe know where that particular place is or\nwhat that named range is right here.\n\n155\n00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:59.880\nSo this is our name\nmanager that can be good.\n\n156\n00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.820\nNow the thing is, with this name manager.\n\n157\n00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.011\nWhy don't we go ahead and\n\n158\n00:09:03.011 --> 00:09:06.033\ndo one thing in the name manager\nwhile we're talking about it.\n\n159\n00:09:06.033 --> 00:09:10.593\nHere, South Sales, what if I typed in $20,\n\n160\n00:09:10.593 --> 00:09:14.470\nI added another cell within this range.\n\n161\n00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:19.980\nBut South Sales only refers to as\na named range for these three cells.\n\n162\n00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:23.770\nWhat if I wanted to edit,\nI don't wanna change the name.\n\n163\n00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:26.310\nI need to add more of that reference.\n\n164\n00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:29.690\nThat's where that name manager can\ncome in handy, to where you can go in,\n\n165\n00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:30.910\nlet's go look at it.\n\n166\n00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:35.850\nYou can edit that particular name,\nsay all right, well let's go ahead and\n\n167\n00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:39.640\nif I click it,\nnotice it says I could change the name.\n\n168\n00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.630\nMaybe I wanted to do a lowercase\ninstead of uppercase just because.\n\n169\n00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:47.620\nAnd then it refers to,\nwell I just need to change that reference.\n\n170\n00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.790\nSo I can click this\nlittle button right here.\n\n171\n00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:51.050\nNow there's a couple ways you could do it.\n\n172\n00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:53.740\nYou could just come right here and\njust type in 7,\n\n173\n00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:56.860\ncause I know it's the next\nrow down that I need.\n\n174\n00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.750\nOr, I could go ahead and\nlet's do it back to six.\n\n175\n00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:03.780\nI can click on this button right here and\nit collapses this up.\n\n176\n00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:07.638\nI come back out over here,\nselect the cells that I need to do, and\n\n177\n00:10:07.638 --> 00:10:10.293\nnow, actually, that's actually bad.\n\n178\n00:10:10.293 --> 00:10:11.126\n&gt;&gt;

Let's go here and I want this, okay.\n\n296\n00:15:44.823 --> 00:15:46.794\nHold the ctrl key and this.\n\n297\n00:15:46.794 --> 00:15:53.229\nWell D4 through D6 is the north sales,\nall right?\n\n298\n00:15:53.229 --> 00:15:55.312\n&gt;&gt; What's strange is that when\nyou did just the south sales,\n\n299\n00:15:55.312 --> 00:15:56.340\nit showed up as south sales.\n\n300\n00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:57.003\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n301\n00:15:57.003 --> 00:15:59.510\n&gt;&gt; It wasn't until you\nhit that control key.\n\n302\n00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:00.690\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n303\n00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:03.909\nOkay.\nWell, it's supposed to do that.\n\n304\n00:16:03.909 --> 00:16:10.373\nI'm a little confused as to why it's not\ndoing that, let's try it one more time.\n\n305\n00:16:10.373 --> 00:16:14.963\nLet's go the insert function route,\nand we'll say yes, I want the sum, and\n\n306\n00:16:14.963 --> 00:16:18.008\nI want the first number of these,\nyep South Sales.\n\n307\n00:16:18.008 --> 00:16:22.830\nSecond number is going to be these,\nwhich is the North Sales.\n\n308\n00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:24.000\n&gt;&gt; I like that a whole lot better.\n\n309\n00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.102\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, yeah maybe-\n&gt;&gt; Ctrl key does some crazy voodoo to it.\n\n310\n00:16:29.102 --> 00:16:33.557\n&gt;&gt; I'm a little perplexed honestly, my\nfirst inclination is to blame the virtual\n\n311\n00:16:33.557 --> 00:16:36.610\nmachine, but\nI don't think I can do that on this one.\n\n312\n00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:41.295\n[LAUGH] But, it is interesting that with\nthe auto sum and using that Ctrl key.\n\n313\n00:16:41.295 --> 00:16:44.592\nThe only thing is I've made\nit with a mapping of them,\n\n314\n00:16:44.592 --> 00:16:46.850\nbecause I am using a Mac keyboard.\n\n315\n00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:48.190\n&gt;&gt; Who knows?\n\n316\n00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:52.310\n&gt;&gt; That's okay, well, if it happens\nto you, let's just go ahead and\n\n317\n00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:54.116\nsay maybe we should use\nthe insert function box instead.\n\n318\n00:16:54.116 --> 00:16:56.340\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz that definitely works.\n\n319\n00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:59.260\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and typing it out worked as well.\n\n320\n00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.775\nSo if option three doesn't work,\nyou know, what we won't do option three.\n\n321\n00:17:02.775 --> 00:17:05.747\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We call that a work around.\n\n322\n00:17:05.747 --> 00:17:09.255\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and just like let it go,\n\n323\n00:17:09.255 --> 00:17:13.780\nlet it go,\nit won't make you upset any longer.\n\n324\n00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:15.236\n&gt;&gt; Hold you back anymore.\n\n325\n00:17:15.236 --> 00:17:15.769\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n326\n00:17:15.769 --> 00:17:16.903\n&gt;&gt; I have two little girls.\n\n327\n00:17:16.903 --> 00:17:19.485\n&gt;&gt; That's so awesome,\nthat just made me very proud.\n\n328\n00:17:19.485 --> 00:17:24.140\n[LAUGH] Okay, so let's come over to\nsome other ways that we can go ahead and\n\n329\n00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:27.695\ndo some named ranges,\nthis one's pretty fun,\n\n330\n00:17:27.695 --> 00:17:32.225\nthis is one of those kind of magical\nones that makes me happy with this.\n\n331\n00:17:32.225 --> 00:17:35.986\nSo we have our cats over here and\nwe have our sales and\n\n332\n00:17:35.986 --> 00:17:40.800\nI want to make like this range of\ncells that would be Fuego sales and\n\n333\n00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:47.303\nthen these would be Bishops and Pumpkin\nand Pomerance, Sasha, Singer, and Tootsie.\n\n334\n00:17:47.303 --> 00:17:49.230\nYou got the idea, right?\n\n335\n00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:54.611\nCool thing is, I can select all of\nthis and say, okay, guess what?\n\n336\n00:17:54.611 --> 00:17:58.416\nI want you to make named\nranges based off of\n\n337\n00:17:58.416 --> 00:18:02.239\nthe labels that are in that first column.\n\n338\n00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.660\nThat's why you have create from selection,\n\n339\n00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:11.850\nif I click create from selection its\nalready going to determine, hey,\n\n340\n00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:15.580\nI see that kind of differentiation\nof that first column,\n\n341\n00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:20.380\nthat left column, I see that is that the\none you want, but notice you could choose\n\n342\n00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:24.810\nwhich one you want, you go head and click\nokay and you're like, yeah, did it work?\n\n343\n00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:29.265\nIt did, if I come over here to\nthe name manager look at that, Fuego,\n\n344\n00:18:29.265 --> 00:18:32.875\nthere is the sheet and\nit is D2 through B2, awesome.\n\n345\n00:18:32.875 --> 00:18:37.207\nYou know we can also check if we select\nthem it tells us in the name box that that\n\n346\n00:18:37.207 --> 00:18:40.100\nis the Puma and that this is the Pumpkin.\n\n347\n00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.491\nYes, I love that, isn't that candy?\n\n348\n00:18:41.491 --> 00:18:44.820\n&gt;&gt; Is there a way to because\nthese are obviously sales figures\n\n349\n00:18:45.985 --> 00:18:48.658\n&gt;&gt; Fuego might be a little too ambiguous.\n\n350\n00:18:48.658 --> 00:18:53.511\nI want to be Fuego sales,\nam I able to add on to that auto function?\n\n351\n00:18:53.511 --> 00:18:55.612\n&gt;&gt; Well, with the automatic one and\n\n352\n00:18:55.612 --> 00:18:59.330\nhe's only gonna take what\nthe contents are of that sale.\n\n353\n00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:04.026\nNow, if I had typed in Fuego sales,\nBishop sales, if I had actually,\n\n354\n00:19:04.026 --> 00:19:07.770\nadded that into the content of the cell,\nit would then,\n\n355\n00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:11.539\nanytime there's a space,\nit would put an underscore.\n\n356\n00:19:11.539 --> 00:19:15.519\nSo if it has multiple words,\nyou could do that.\n\n357\n00:19:15.519 --> 00:19:19.752\n&gt;&gt; The hacker in me, is there any kind of\nmetadata I can insert into the cell that\n\n358\n00:19:19.752 --> 00:19:21.879\nsays sales, that it's a sales cell?\n\n359\n00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:28.590\nAnother pull from that, I wonder I\ndont know, I'm thinking out loud.\n\n360\n00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:30.759\n[LAUGH] That's my homework for\ntonight, right?\n\n361\n00:19:30.759 --> 00:19:35.335\n&gt;&gt; I would say, I'm sure there is\nsomewhere to half that you could do, but\n\n362\n00:19:35.335 --> 00:19:38.400\nsome weird scripting stuff you could do.\n\n363\n00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.980\n&gt;&gt; The default answer is sure in DBA.\n\n364\n00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:44.855\n&gt;&gt; Mine is absolutely positively maybe.\n\n365\n00:19:44.855 --> 00:19:46.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah.\n\n366\n00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:50.380\nMy brain cells are going no, I don't know.\n\n367\n00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:53.300\n[LAUGH] We're just going\nto leave that one alone.\n\n368\n00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:59.744\nBut yes, we could go into the name\nmanager and we could go into Fuego and\n\n369\n00:19:59.744 --> 00:20:04.456\nwe could edit, and\nthen we could do Fuego_sales.\n\n370\n00:20:04.456 --> 00:20:09.194\nSo I could go ahead and\nmanually add in the extra information if\n\n371\n00:20:09.194 --> 00:20:12.757\nit's not getting exactly\nthe way I want it to.\n\n372\n00:20:12.757 --> 00:20:17.553\nSo we do have that particular one, but\nthe whole automatic part of it, I'm gonna,\n\n373\n00:20:17.553 --> 00:20:19.558\nI'm gonna take a pass on that one.\n\n374\n00:20:19.558 --> 00:20:22.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And we're going to do the same\n\n375\n00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:26.910\nthing just for fun, you can see\nthat we can select all of these.\n\n376\n00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:31.391\nUse the create from selection,\nuse that top row of that's what I want and\n\n377\n00:20:31.391 --> 00:20:35.009\nthen say, yep, that's so\nsuper cool, and there you go.\n\n378\n00:20:35.009 --> 00:20:40.124\nNow, one thing I did want to make mention\nof is if I said okay let's go ahead and\n\n379\n00:20:40.124 --> 00:20:45.670\ndo a sum of and I'm using our little cute\nshortcuts and everything, double click.\n\n380\n00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:51.622\nBefore I go any further,\nlet me stop and just give you a couple\n\n381\n00:20:51.622 --> 00:20:56.664\nlittle tid bits on typing and\nI do this all the time.\n\n382\n00:20:56.664 --> 00:21:01.068\nAnd I don't know if you hear me when\nwe're in open office settings, I'm like,\n\n383\n00:21:01.068 --> 00:21:01.610\nstop it.\n\n384\n00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:03.601\nAnd cuz we all kinda talk to each other.\n\n385\n00:21:03.601 --> 00:21:06.982\nIt's because I do this all the time and\nit makes me irritated.\n\n386\n00:21:06.982 --> 00:21:09.489\n&gt;&gt; So this is another bag for us.\n\n387\n00:21:09.489 --> 00:21:10.950\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, another bag, yes.\n\n388\n00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:16.246\nIf I go ahead and click equals and\nI start typing in su,\n\n389\n00:21:16.246 --> 00:21:23.440\nand I want the sum my inclination is\nto hit Enter, that's what I want.\n\n390\n00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.990\nWell, when I hit enter\nit takes me out of it.\n\n391\n00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:28.690\nIt's like-\n&gt;&gt; It's like saying you entered what you\n\n392\n00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:30.610\nwant, and I'm off to the next thing.\n\n393\n00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:34.910\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I'm telling not listening to\nmy own directions that I tell you guys.\n\n394\n00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:38.870\nEnter goes ahead and says I'm done\nI've accepted I'm ready to move on.\n\n395\n00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:41.902\nNo, so the thing is if you're using this\n\n396\n00:21:41.902 --> 00:21:46.224\nto help you type things in\nyou need to use your tab key.\n\n397\n00:21:46.224 --> 00:21:47.850\nThat's the one I want so.\n\n398\n00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:49.171\n&gt;&gt; Love that tab key.\n\n399\n00:21:49.171 --> 00:21:50.920\n&gt;&gt; Down arrow, yep.\n\n400\n00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.583\n&gt;&gt; Tab, there it goes ahead and populate.\n\n401\n00:21:53.583 --> 00:21:58.340\n&gt;&gt; And typically, I'm using it as a tab\nautofill, and it's doing that here.\n\n402\n00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:03.992\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so if I start typing f, okay,\nthen we're gonna type in the letter u.\n\n403\n00:22:03.992 --> 00:22:08.320\nThere it is, don't hit enter,\nhit the tab key.\n\n404\n00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.856\nThere it goes ahead and populate, now,\nI can go ahead and close a parenthesis and\n\n405\n00:22:11.856 --> 00:22:13.680\nhit enter and I've got, now, Perfect.\n\n406\n00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.268\nSo, yes, use the Tab.\n\n407\n00:22:15.268 --> 00:22:18.812\nDown here with Tab,\ndown here with Tab to go ahead and\n\n408\n00:22:18.812 --> 00:22:23.981\nstart populating your functions in\nthe whole typing out fun helping thing.\n\n409\n00:22:23.981 --> 00:22:26.432\nNow, we're gonna take this and\nI'm going to put them,\n\n410\n00:22:26.432 --> 00:22:28.742\ncuz you're thinking relative reference,\nright?\n\n411\n00:22:28.742 --> 00:22:32.000\nWe'll the thing we start\nusing name ranges.\n\n412\n00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.280\nWell, named ranges are great for\nmaking sense to you there,\n\n413\n00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.950\nbut relative reference,\nthe whole copy down and everything,\n\n414\n00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:45.720\nit works with relative reference for\ncell references, not named references.\n\n415\n00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:46.248\nYeah, you got it.\n\n416\n00:22:46.248 --> 00:22:49.120\n&gt;&gt;

We should [LAUGH]\n\n427\n00:23:11.223 --> 00:23:12.055\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You know what,\n\n428\n00:23:12.055 --> 00:23:13.032\nmaybe the next version.\n\n429\n00:23:13.032 --> 00:23:15.785\n&gt;&gt; That's right, maybe next time,\nright, they'll get it someday.\n\n430\n00:23:15.785 --> 00:23:18.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And just to go ahead and\n\n431\n00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:21.760\ngive you one last example of\nhow you can use named ranges.\n\n432\n00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:26.880\nThe thing is it doesn't actually have to\nbe a range, it can be a single cell, okay.\n\n433\n00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:27.940\nI can-\n&gt;&gt; That's interesting,\n\n434\n00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.019\nis it technically a range\nif there's only one?\n\n435\n00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:34.997\nSure, it's a range of [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; In Excel land, it is, yeah.\n\n436\n00:23:34.997 --> 00:23:35.913\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well,\n\n437\n00:23:35.913 --> 00:23:37.980\nit's a range of just one to one.\n\n438\n00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.896\n&gt;&gt; Whatever helps you sleep at night,\nVonne.\n\n439\n00:23:41.896 --> 00:23:42.989\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n440\n00:23:42.989 --> 00:23:44.206\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're gonna go with that one.\n\n441\n00:23:44.206 --> 00:23:45.997\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna go with that one,\nthat's right.\n\n442\n00:23:45.997 --> 00:23:50.002\n&gt;&gt; So you can see here, and we've done\nthis where we did our totals and we did\n\n443\n00:23:50.002 --> 00:23:54.483\nour totals plus the commission, so let's\njust do a quick auto sum, like there.\n\n444\n00:23:54.483 --> 00:23:59.052\nGo ahead and pull that down, we went\nahead and did the first one, selected it,\n\n445\n00:23:59.052 --> 00:24:01.492\ngot the black plus sign, filled it down.\n\n446\n00:24:01.492 --> 00:24:03.260\nSo it totals plus commission and\n\n447\n00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:07.515\nthis is where we talked about absolute\nreference within our basic function,\n\n448\n00:24:07.515 --> 00:24:12.490\nthink it was basic functions part two\nactually, where we go over this concept.\n\n449\n00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:15.550\nAnd we said, all right, we need to make\nsure we put dollar signs in those row\n\n450\n00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:17.050\nreferences, in the column references.\n\n451\n00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:19.880\nWell, the thing is,\nremember what Name Manager does?\n\n452\n00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:26.090\nYour name manager already puts\nin the absolute references for\n\n453\n00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:31.050\nthose cells within the range, or\nin this case we're gonna do a single cell.\n\n454\n00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:34.740\nWe're gonna take this cell right here,\nI2, the 10%.\n\n455\n00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:37.650\nThis is the commission,\n\n456\n00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:41.270\nlike in our brains, this is commission,\nso give it that name.\n\n457\n00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:41.950\nCome over here.\n\n458\n00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:43.080\nI'm gonna to go to the name box, and\n\n459\n00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:47.930\nwe're gonna type in lower\ncase C-O-M-M-I-S-S-I-O-N.\n\n460\n00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:50.020\nHit the enter to accept that.\n\n461\n00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:53.320\nThat's the name of that one cell.\n\n462\n00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:59.110\nSo if I come over here and type in,\nlet's go, equals this particular cell.\n\n463\n00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:06.300\nTimes and then we start comn,\nthere's my tab, tag.\n\n464\n00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:09.730\nHit the tab key, there we go, highlights.\n\n465\n00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:14.750\nAgain, it's just a named\nreference to a single cell.\n\n466\n00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:17.170\nNow, if I use that, it goes ahead.\n\n467\n00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:20.160\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Why don't you like that?\n\n468\n00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:23.880\nWe found a typo,\nhow do you want to correct it.\n\n469\n00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:24.550\nOkay cool.\n\n470\n00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:28.400\nI like when it does that autocorrect for\nme.\n\n471\n00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:32.250\nI'm not exactly sure what my error was but\nit will.\n\n472\n00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:34.670\nYou know what.\n\n473\n00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:35.312\nI tried to do close of the function.\n\n474\n00:25:35.312 --> 00:25:38.432\n&gt;&gt; I didn't see to be honest with you.\n\n475\n00:25:38.432 --> 00:25:41.946\n&gt;&gt; I don't, this happens all the time\nwhere if we ever have to do an edit,\n\n476\n00:25:41.946 --> 00:25:45.120\nthey're like,\njust go back to what you were just saying.\n\n477\n00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.370\nI'm like, what was I just saying?\n\n478\n00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:48.190\nI don't even know.\n\n479\n00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:49.330\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Who am I?\n\n480\n00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:50.115\n&gt;&gt; I have that a lot.\n\n481\n00:25:50.115 --> 00:25:50.800\n[LAUGH] So\n\n482\n00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:55.980\nwe've got here, and if I pull this down\nto copy, it automatically changes.\n\n483\n00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:57.490\nI don't have to do anything of that\n\n484\n00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:03.260\nthe I2 is an absolute reference\nbecause this is an absolute reference.\n\n485\n00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:08.390\nJust keep going back to the cell that is\nnamed commission and then add that into or\n\n486\n00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:12.320\ntimes that into the totals and\nit's all part of my formula so, cool.\n\n487\n00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:16.820\n&gt;&gt; So name cells by nature\nare absolute references?\n\n488\n00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:18.685\n&gt;&gt; Whether it's a single cell or a range.\n\n489\n00:26:18.685 --> 00:26:19.407\n&gt;&gt; Or a range.\n\n490\n00:26:19.407 --> 00:26:23.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so back when we're here,\nthey're all dollar signs.\n\n491\n00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.190\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; They're all absolute references.\n\n492\n00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:27.000\nThis is never gonna change.\n\n493\n00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.700\nThis is never gonna change.\n\n494\n00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.620\nThis is never gonna change.\n\n495\n00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:31.760\nIt's automatically that.\n\n496\n00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:35.820\nSo if you just go ahead and\ngive that single cell a name,\n\n497\n00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:39.600\nuse it in your formative function, you've\ngot an automatic absolute reference.\n\n498\n00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.215\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n&gt;&gt; And it gives you that human element of,\n\n499\n00:26:42.215 --> 00:26:46.515\nyeah, E3 which we'll okay we'll\njust have to roll with that one.\n\n500\n00:26:46.515 --> 00:26:47.905\n[LAUGH] And times it by the commission.\n\n501\n00:26:47.905 --> 00:26:52.261\n&gt;&gt; Super simple like you said\nthe readability makes it easier for\n\n502\n00:26:52.261 --> 00:26:57.010\nus as humans to start working\nin computer land and Excel land.\n\n503\n00:26:57.010 --> 00:27:01.280\nAnd interact with each other instead\nof going, you dumb computer,\n\n504\n00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.130\nI don't know what the heck\nyou're talking about.\n\n505\n00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:06.020\nAnd you're going well,\nI just want to use names [LAUGH].\n\n506\n00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:08.260\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's funny when you're like,\nyeah, what's my name?\n\n507\n00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:09.260\nI do that all the time.\n\n508\n00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.770\nIt's part of the episode [LAUGH].\n\n509\n00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:12.060\nThat's pretty funny.\n\n510\n00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:13.890\n&gt;&gt; And we do this all the time.\n\n511\n00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:19.570\nThink about if you go to ITPro.tv or\nOfficePro.tv, any of those things.\n\n512\n00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:23.560\nThat's actually a number that may change\nbehind the scenes that you never see.\n\n513\n00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:27.180\nAll you have to remember is that\nhuman readable format's the same idea\n\n514\n00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:29.980\nas that we're using something\nthat we identify with.\n\n515\n00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:32.170\nAnd that is translated\ninto computer speed.\n\n516\n00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:35.405\n&gt;&gt; You techy.\nYou're talking about IP addresses,\n\n517\n00:27:35.405 --> 00:27:37.183\nDNS, and all that fun.\n\n518\n00:27:37.183 --> 00:27:39.002\nI do know a little bit about that.\n\n519\n00:27:39.002 --> 00:27:39.534\n&gt;&gt; A little bit about that.\n\n520\n00:27:39.534 --> 00:27:41.083\n&gt;&gt; I do have my net plus certification.\n\n521\n00:27:41.083 --> 00:27:41.808\n&gt;&gt; You do now.\n\n522\n00:27:41.808 --> 00:27:44.354\n&gt;&gt; I wouldn't know how to connect\nyou to the internet, though.\n\n523\n00:27:44.354 --> 00:27:46.090\n[LAUGH] It was a long time ago.\n\n524\n00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:51.260\nI do know about different subnets and the\ndifferent classes and loopback addresses.\n\n525\n00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:54.835\nLook at me, just spouting out all this\nIT knowledge, and now we've got to stop.\n\n526\n00:27:54.835 --> 00:27:56.605\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Certainly way out of my\n\n527\n00:27:56.605 --> 00:27:57.300\ndepth here.\n\n528\n00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:57.981\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n529\n00:27:57.981 --> 00:27:59.051\n&gt;&gt;

my helmet on,\n\n19\n00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.742\ncuz it's gonna blow my mind.\n\n20\n00:00:43.742 --> 00:00:45.668\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It might be a little bit.\n\n21\n00:00:45.668 --> 00:00:51.130\n[CROSSTALK] Yes, we're gonna be\ntalking about 3D cell reference and\n\n22\n00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.100\nthis is another one.\n\n23\n00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.090\nThey're all so fun to me, obviously.\n\n24\n00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.650\nThis is one of my favorites,\nbut this one's pretty cool.\n\n25\n00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:05.460\nSo let's say you have to do a lot of the\nsame things across multiple worksheets.\n\n26\n00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.970\nMaybe we have quarters, quarter one,\nquarter two, quarter three, quarter four.\n\n27\n00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.750\nAnd that's basically the exact\nsame thing on every worksheet but\n\n28\n00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.660\njust with some different\nnumbers changed out.\n\n29\n00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.675\nEverything's in the same place,\nwe've got it all the same way and\n\n30\n00:01:21.675 --> 00:01:25.977\nyou wanna perform calculations and\nalso, we wanted just to go ahead and\n\n31\n00:01:25.977 --> 00:01:30.298\nenter the same information across\nall the worksheets at the same time.\n\n32\n00:01:30.298 --> 00:01:34.288\n&gt;&gt; This one, I'll be completely\nhonest with you, I didn't know you\n\n33\n00:01:34.288 --> 00:01:38.867\ncould do this until kind of recent where\nI was just like, are you kidding me?\n\n34\n00:01:38.867 --> 00:01:39.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n35\n00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.520\nit's just, it's one of those things,\n\n36\n00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.800\nI knew how to the formulas part\nof the three cell reference.\n\n37\n00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.830\nIt's like, okay, yeah, you go ahead and\ncalculate the same cell across multiple\n\n38\n00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.780\nworksheets and it just goes ahead and\ncalculates stuff.\n\n39\n00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.160\nGreat, functions and the formulas.\n\n40\n00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.050\nI didn't know about\nthe entering data part.\n\n41\n00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.321\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; Well, you answered,\n\n42\n00:01:55.321 --> 00:01:59.230\nmy first question was, what the heck was\n3D cells, and I'm assuming, from what you\n\n43\n00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.163\njust said, was that it's a cell that is\nbeing used throughout multiple worksheets.\n\n44\n00:02:03.163 --> 00:02:06.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's the third dimensions,\nthree-dimensional.\n\n45\n00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.100\nIt's not just-\n&gt;&gt; It's busting out of its\n\n46\n00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.990\nlittle own worksheet.\n\n47\n00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n48\n00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.202\n&gt;&gt; Kind of giving you- [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n49\n00:02:11.202 --> 00:02:15.063\nsome three-dimensional cube thing.\n\n50\n00:02:15.063 --> 00:02:15.830\nYeah, sure, in my brain.\n\n51\n00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:16.421\n&gt;&gt; It was a nice try.\n\n52\n00:02:16.421 --> 00:02:20.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH] In my brain, it's forming a cube.\n\n53\n00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.390\nBut yeah, it's pretty neat.\n\n54\n00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.760\nSo let's jump in.\n\n55\n00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.060\nAnd, let me start giving you some\nexamples of where we're going.\n\n56\n00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.610\nSo, I do have a couple of workbooks\nalready open that we're gonna be\n\n57\n00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.000\ngoing with across here.\n\n58\n00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.490\nOne that we have all ready done, one\nthat we're gonna enter the content into.\n\n59\n00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.020\nBut let's go ahead and look at this.\n\n60\n00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.010\nSo, this is our 3D enter content.\n\n61\n00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.600\nSo I have Christmas Cats Regional Sales.\n\n62\n00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.840\nNow I went ahead and\ncreated all these worksheets for us.\n\n63\n00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.890\nBut you can see the only thing\nthat's different right now for\n\n64\n00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.010\nus to kind of keep our brain intact is\nthat this is the Southern region so\n\n65\n00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.000\nthis is the worksheet called South.\n\n66\n00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.035\nThis is the worksheet,\nI just skipped over one,\n\n67\n00:03:01.035 --> 00:03:02.840\n[LAUGH] this is the worksheet called West.\n\n68\n00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.560\nThis is East.\n\n69\n00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.990\nThis is North, South, East and West.\n\n70\n00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.240\nSo we have all of them there and\nI went ahead and put that there so\n\n71\n00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.150\nwe can have, again, that visual reference\nas we are on that particular worksheet.\n\n72\n00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.989\nWell, I'm setting this up.\n\n73\n00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.640\nI know that our Christmas Cats\nsales has four categories.\n\n74\n00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.840\nAnd that we have quarters and so we would\nneed to basically make it look like this.\n\n75\n00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.950\nI want to have the Toys,\nAccessories Clothing and Food.\n\n76\n00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.810\nThe Total Average, the Q1's and da-da-da.\n\n77\n00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.099\nSo one way.\n\n78\n00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:42.906\nThis is not anything to do with,\nC3 cell reference right now.\n\n79\n00:03:42.906 --> 00:03:47.060\nOne way, you could go ahead and\nbuild out this first one.\n\n80\n00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.420\nYou can go ahead and type in toys and\nda-da-da, all that other stuff.\n\n81\n00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.880\nYou go ahead and type it all in,\nget everything done and\n\n82\n00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.500\nyou can copy the worksheet.\n\n83\n00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.030\nWe would go ahead create a copy,\nmake that, and then go ahead and\n\n84\n00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.970\ndelete all the content out.\n\n85\n00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.920\nSo if I was here, just to\ndemonstrate that, we're on the West.\n\n86\n00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.313\nSo I've done all of this, got my one.\n\n87\n00:04:11.313 --> 00:04:15.356\nNow I need to make another one,\nso you go ahead and copy it.\n\n88\n00:04:15.356 --> 00:04:18.200\nWe make a copy, we move it to the end.\n\n89\n00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.250\nAnd now we have an exact duplicate.\n\n90\n00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.497\nThen we come in here and say that\nthis is east if we can type it in.\n\n91\n00:04:25.497 --> 00:04:32.290\nEast change this to east and then go\nahead and get rid of these numbers.\n\n92\n00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.640\nAnd then type in all of our new\nnumbers for that kinda stuff.\n\n93\n00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.280\nAnd then do it again, copy it go ahead and\nchange over, go ahead and\n\n94\n00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.420\nchange over that's fine\nnothing wrong about that.\n\n95\n00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:48.480\nBut, well now I've decided that it's not\ntoys that needs to change to the same\n\n96\n00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.734\nthing, it needs to be something different\nor I need to add a whole other thing.\n\n97\n00:04:51.734 --> 00:04:53.675\nMan, I've already got them already done.\n\n98\n00:04:53.675 --> 00:04:56.646\nNow I have to do the one part copy,\npaste, copy, paste, copy.\n\n99\n00:04:56.646 --> 00:04:58.142\nNo, no, no, no, no.\n\n100\n00:04:58.142 --> 00:05:00.440\nLet me break it down for\nyou to make it a little easier.\n\n101\n00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.210\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n102\n00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.860\nundo this to make sure this goes\nback to the way I want it to be.\n\n103\n00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.455\nOkay, good, and\nkeep on going back that's perfect.\n\n104\n00:05:08.455 --> 00:05:14.865\nYou can use the 3D cell reference,\n3D sheet reference to say,\n\n105\n00:05:14.865 --> 00:05:19.851\ngo ahead on and\nall of these worksheets do this same\n\n106\n00:05:19.851 --> 00:05:24.140\nthing in the same place\nacross all of them.\n\n107\n00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.170\nWait what?\n\n108\n00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:27.840\nOkay [LAUGH] watch.\n\n109\n00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.250\nSo I have here, I wanna put toys,\naccessories, clothing and food here.\n\n110\n00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:38.370\nI'm going to select North the worksheet,\nhold the shift key,\n\n111\n00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.535\nso remember,\nshift is going to be selecting a range.\n\n112\n00:05:41.535 --> 00:05:46.721\nSelect that and notice I have\nall four worksheets selected.\n\n113\n00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:52.520\nI'm on the North one, come over here\nto A6 and we're gonna type in Toys and\n\n114\n00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:58.470\nwe're gonna type in Accessories, and\nwe're gonna type in, what was it?\n\n115\n00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.812\nClothing and Food.\n\n116\n00:06:02.812 --> 00:06:09.450\nNow, I'm going to select all of these rows\nbecause I had it formatted before this.\n\n117\n00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.800\nAnd I want to go ahead and\nmake these rows a little higher and\n\n118\n00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.810\nI also want to go ahead and, whoops,\nthat’s not what I wanted to do.\n\n119\n00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.740\nLet’s undo that and let’s just make this\na little bit wider so I can see that.\n\n120\n00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.640\nAll right cool.\n\n121\n00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.382\nWell, you're thinking I'm just doing\nthis on the North worksheet, aren't I?\n\n122\n00:06:25.382 --> 00:06:29.434\nNo, if you come over,\nlook this is the South worksheet, and\n\n123\n00:06:29.434 --> 00:06:32.430\nthe East worksheet and the West worksheet.\n\n124\n00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.786\nI just entered in the exact same\ncontent across all of the sheets.\n\n125\n00:06:35.786 --> 00:06:37.850\n&gt;&gt; Saved yourself a lot of time and\neffort there, did you?\n\n126\n00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:38.380\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n127\n00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:38.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n128\n00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:43.020\nthis where the part where I'm like,\nI didn't know you could do this.\n\n129\n00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I've just been copying and deleting and\n\n130\n00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.510\nchanging out the pieces.\n\n131\n00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.038\n&gt;&gt; You crazy woman.\n\n132\n00:06:48.038 --> 00:06:50.310\n&gt;&gt; I know-\n&gt;&gt; What were you thinking?\n\n133\n00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI'm pretty excited about this one.\n\n134\n00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.156\nSo I just thought that was neat,\nso you can go ahead and\n\n135\n00:06:57.156 --> 00:07:01.795\npopulate multiple worksheets with\nthe same content in the same place.\n\n136\n00:07:01.795 --> 00:07:03.984\nAs long as you go ahead and\nselect them all first.\n\n137\n00:07:03.984 --> 00:07:06.698\nAnd the cool thing is,\nlet's go ahead and keep going,\n\n138\n00:07:06.698 --> 00:07:10.320\nI'm gonna Shift click to\nselect all of my worksheets.\n\n139\n00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.330\nYou can do all the formatting.\n\n140\n00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:12.970\nCuz you noticed I changed the row height,\nright?\n\n141\n00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:14.920\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And I changed the column width.\n\n142\n00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.880\nAnd if I came to here and typed in Q1,\nthese are all preformatted,\n\n143\n00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.280\nby the way, so I mean,\nthat's because I do my practices, and\n\n144\n00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.840\nthen I delete it all with content up for\nyou guys to do your other stuff.\n\n145\n00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:31.980\nSo we have Q3, Q4, and now, oops,\nokay, let's do capital Q, and\n\n146\n00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:36.980\nnow I'm going to go ahead and\nchange these to be.\n\n147\n00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.038\n&gt;&gt; No Q5?\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n\n148\n00:07:38.038 --> 00:07:40.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No Q5, not this year.\n\n149\n00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:42.437\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So we've got here,\n\n150\n00:07:42.437 --> 00:07:46.129\nand then I can make it red and\nthen I can make that column width.\n\n151\n00:07:46.129 --> 00:07:49.171\nIt's just so neat to where it's like,\nlook at that.\n\n152\n00:07:49.171 --> 00:07:52.916\nAll of them across all of my\nworksheets have the exact same content.\n\n153\n00:07:52.916 --> 00:07:56.391\nThe other thing is, not just formatting\nanything, you could delete them.\n\n154\n00:07:56.391 --> 00:07:58.439\nWhat if, you know what?\n\n155\n00:07:58.439 --> 00:08:02.368\nFood is no longer a category, and\nI wanna delete it on all of them.\n\n156\n00:08:02.368 --> 00:08:03.040\n&gt;&gt; Who needs anymore?\n\n157\n00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.392\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n158\n00:08:04.392 --> 00:08:05.688\nYeah, they're fine.\n\n159\n00:08:05.688 --> 00:08:06.208\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n160\n00:08:06.208 --> 00:08:08.629\n&gt;&gt; So we go ahead and select all of these.\n\n161\n00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:11.601\nTake that one cell, just go ahead and\nhit the delete key, and\n\n162\n00:08:11.601 --> 00:08:13.303\nit deletes it across all of those.\n\n163\n00:08:13.303 --> 00:08:17.670\n&gt;&gt; So it just has to make sure that you\nhave all the worksheets that you want\n\n164\n00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:20.422\nselected to have this\neffect to go out to it.\n\n165\n00:08:20.422 --> 00:08:22.116\nJust make sure they're selected and\nba-da-bing, you make a change, and\n\n166\n00:08:22.116 --> 00:08:22.650\nit changes all of them.\n\n167\n00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:28.129\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and the whole idea is that\nit's in the same exact place.\n\n168\n00:08:28.129 --> 00:08:31.152\nThe cell is the same in all,\nhowever many sheets across.\n\n169\n00:08:31.152 --> 00:08:32.376\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n170\n00:08:32.376 --> 00:08:37.365\n&gt;&gt; So if I had food on,\nlet's say, row nine in north, but\n\n171\n00:08:37.365 --> 00:08:43.783\nit's in row ten in west,\nit's gonna delete whatever's in row nine.\n\n172\n00:08:43.783 --> 00:08:45.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n173\n00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:50.960\n&gt;&gt; That's the whole idea of same cell\nreference, or same reference across\n\n174\n00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.900\nmultiple sheets so just as long as\neverything is uniform you're good.\n\n175\n00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.781\nYou start getting into changing\nthings here and there, and\n\n176\n00:08:59.781 --> 00:09:04.841\nmoving things around, then it starts to\nlose its power of why this is so cool.\n\n177\n00:09:04.841 --> 00:09:08.001\nSo think about it,\nyou have months of the year.\n\n178\n00:09:08.001 --> 00:09:10.086\nYou're going to have\nworksheets with the months.\n\n179\n00:09:10.086 --> 00:09:14.728\nThere's so many different examples of\nwhere you have the exact same data across\n\n180\n00:09:14.728 --> 00:09:16.123\nmultiple worksheets.\n\n181\n00:09:16.123 --> 00:09:18.876\nSo that's why I feel this is one of\nthose like, cool, that's awesome, yay.\n\n182\n00:09:18.876 --> 00:09:21.228\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n183\n00:09:21.228 --> 00:09:25.810\nlet's move onto performing some\ncalculations with our worksheet.\n\n184\n00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:29.706\nSo I have this one right here,\nI have 3D formulas.\n\n185\n00:09:29.706 --> 00:09:33.645\nNow this one, I would say we already did,\nI did the same thing\n\n186\n00:09:33.645 --> 00:09:37.907\nto set this up that I was just\nshowing you in the entering content.\n\n187\n00:09:37.907 --> 00:09:42.748\nYou could see that I have a north\nworksheet, a south, and an east.\n\n188\n00:09:42.748 --> 00:09:46.953\nNow I use the same way of putting\nin the labels and everything, and\n\n189\n00:09:46.953 --> 00:09:51.924\nthen I did come into the north, and just\nto give us a quick tour around the block\n\n190\n00:09:51.924 --> 00:09:57.127\nof what's in this workbook, notice that\nwe have some sales, and in the north and\n\n191\n00:09:57.127 --> 00:10:01.370\nwatch if you switch over to south,\nthese are different numbers.\n\n192\n00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:07.473\nSo I entered in different sales figures\nfor each one of these quarters.\n\n193\n00:10:07.473 --> 00:10:10.072\nSorry I'm trying to get the zoom\nlevel in for each one of them, so\n\n194\n00:10:10.072 --> 00:10:12.060\nyou can see that a little bit better,\nall right.\n\n195\n00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:15.502\nSo we know that all\nthe numbers are different and\n\n196\n00:10:15.502 --> 00:10:21.455\nnow what I'd like to do is I'd like to go\nahead and calculate all of them together.\n\n197\n00:10:21.455 --> 00:10:28.293\nNow before we get to using the 3D cell\nreference, or the 3D formulas in here,\n\n198\n00:10:28.293 --> 00:10:33.066\nI first want to just insert\nnormal sum functions here.\n\n199\n00:10:33.066 --> 00:10:35.816\nSo, not, we're doing a little preview.\n\n200\n00:10:35.816 --> 00:10:40.120\nGet a preface, get us ready to do the cell\nreference, or the 3D cell reference.\n\n201\n00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.020\nOkay, so nothing special here.\n\n202\n00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.550\nGo ahead and let's do our auto sum.\n\n203\n00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:46.951\nWe're going to select this quarter one.\n\n204\n00:10:46.951 --> 00:10:51.781\nWe're going to hit Enter,\ncomplete that function, select the cell.\n\n205\n00:10:51.781 --> 00:10:55.756\nWe wanna copy, use our fill handle,\nour awesome relative reference.\n\n206\n00:10:55.756 --> 00:10:57.236\nWe go ahead and pull over.\n\n207\n00:10:57.236 --> 00:10:58.908\nThat's fantastic.\n\n208\n00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:01.298\nSame thing here,\nwe'll go ahead and auto sum it.\n\n209\n00:11:01.298 --> 00:11:03.660\nIt automatically pulls in\nall the cells that I want.\n\n210\n00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.610\nI don't need to do any modification.\n\n211\n00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:06.552\nHit enter.\n\n212\n00:11:06.552 --> 00:11:10.808\nOther way, remember to go ahead and\nuse your white plus to select,\n\n213\n00:11:10.808 --> 00:11:12.636\ndo the Ctrl+D to fill down.\n\n214\n00:11:12.636 --> 00:11:14.330\nDoes the copying.\n\n215\n00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:19.060\nSame thing here but we're gonna do\na auto average, and then averaging up,\n\n216\n00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:22.050\nnot that number,\nthese are the arguments that I want.\n\n217\n00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:25.966\nEnter, select, black plus, pull over.\n\n218\n00:11:25.966 --> 00:11:29.092\nThen the yearly totals would be,\nof course,\n\n219\n00:11:29.092 --> 00:11:33.137\nauto summing up the quarter sales and\nthen there's that.\n\n220\n00:11:33.137 --> 00:11:36.690\nThe average, the yearly,\nI think quarterly average.\n\n221\n00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:37.580\nThat makes sense.\n\n222\n00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:41.898\nWe go ahead and then do our average,\ngrab those across.\n\n223\n00:11:41.898 --> 00:11:43.731\nI love when it's super fast and easy.\n\n224\n00:11:43.731 --> 00:11:44.362\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n225\n00:11:44.362 --> 00:11:45.194\n&gt;&gt; Look at that.\n[LAUGH]\n\n226\n00:11:45.194 --> 00:11:45.949\n&gt;&gt; You make Excel look like\n\n227\n00:11:45.949 --> 00:11:47.011\nit's just something people do.\n\n228\n00:11:47.011 --> 00:11:49.667\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, it is.\n\n229\n00:11:49.667 --> 00:11:52.995\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not easily, though.\n\n230\n00:11:52.995 --> 00:11:54.523\nNot without watching you do it first.\n\n231\n00:11:54.523 --> 00:11:55.530\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n&gt;&gt; Now, you can do it.\n\n232\n00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:56.370\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n233\n00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:56.890\n&gt;&gt; That's the whole purpose.\n\n234\n00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:58.202\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Awesome.\n\n235\n00:11:58.202 --> 00:12:02.720\nSo we've got all of this here,\nbut I've got south and east.\n\n236\n00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.500\nRemember, they're all\nset up the exact same.\n\n237\n00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:10.860\nStill not getting into the 3D\nreference thing that you're like?\n\n238\n00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:14.500\nbut I'm just trying to give\nyou other examples right here.\n\n239\n00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.638\nIf I take this,\nit says sum up B6 through B9.\n\n240\n00:12:17.638 --> 00:12:20.634\nRemember when we use fill handle,\nwe really are doing what?\n\n241\n00:12:20.634 --> 00:12:22.060\nCopying, right?\n\n242\n00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.686\nSo using the relative reference,\nrelative reference.\n\n243\n00:12:24.686 --> 00:12:29.726\nIf I take all of this, cuz these were\nall functions in here, so I'm copying.\n\n244\n00:12:29.726 --> 00:12:31.700\nWhen I copy these cells,\n\n245\n00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:36.779\nI am copying the formula slash\nfunction that's in these cells.\n\n246\n00:12:36.779 --> 00:12:41.709\nWell, watch what happens if I come over\nto these self, all right, remember,\n\n247\n00:12:41.709 --> 00:12:43.200\nsame exact position.\n\n248\n00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:47.870\nIf I paste these,\nit's doing the relative reference again.\n\n249\n00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:54.011\nSo it's saying sum of B6 through B9,\njust now on this worksheet.\n\n250\n00:12:54.011 --> 00:12:57.850\nOkay, cool, so it will travel across.\n\n251\n00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:00.744\nNow this is just a straight copy,\nnothing fancy.\n\n252\n00:13:00.744 --> 00:13:05.236\nSo I come back over to north,\ncome on over here, we go ahead and paste.\n\n253\n00:13:05.236 --> 00:13:09.442\nUpdates all the values, so\nit still just copying over that formula,\n\n254\n00:13:09.442 --> 00:13:10.976\njust on a new worksheet.\n\n255\n00:13:10.976 --> 00:13:13.410\nSo, again, nothing super fancy,\n\n256\n00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:18.681\njust throwing all these little tidbits\nas we go through our lessons to say,\n\n257\n00:13:18.681 --> 00:13:23.789\nyeah that's another neat little trick\nthat I can put up my sleeves, so I can\n\n258\n00:13:23.789 --> 00:13:29.094\npull it out whenever I'm ready to go,\nand then we do the same thing over here.\n\n259\n00:13:29.094 --> 00:13:30.309\nSelect these two cells.\n\n260\n00:13:30.309 --> 00:13:32.800\nWe're copying over the function.\n\n261\n00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:33.926\nSame exact position,\n\n262\n00:13:33.926 --> 00:13:37.076\nremember this wouldn't work if\nyou're in a different place.\n\n263\n00:13:37.076 --> 00:13:40.720\nIf we go over here,\nsame place here, oops there we go.\n\n264\n00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:45.139\nLet's go ahead and do that, and\nwe go ahead and do the same thing here.\n\n265\n00:13:45.139 --> 00:13:50.638\nAll right, so now we have done all of our\ncalculations across all of our worksheets,\n\n266\n00:13:50.638 --> 00:13:52.817\nand so that was just normal land.\n\n267\n00:13:52.817 --> 00:13:56.201\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now back into the name of this episode.\n\n268\n00:13:56.201 --> 00:13:56.754\n&gt;&gt; Three-dimensionals.\n\n269\n00:13:56.754 --> 00:13:58.385\n&gt;&gt; The three-dimensional, yes.\n\n270\n00:13:58.385 --> 00:14:00.172\n[NOISE]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n271\n00:14:00.172 --> 00:14:02.562\n&gt;&gt; All right, so my summary.\n\n272\n00:14:02.562 --> 00:14:05.893\nWith my summary, I would like to,\nwhat is a summary?\n\n273\n00:14:05.893 --> 00:14:07.021\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n274\n00:14:07.021 --> 00:14:08.126\n&gt;&gt; Well, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's start there Vonne.\n\n275\n00:14:08.126 --> 00:14:09.885\n&gt;&gt; It's a summary.\n\n276\n00:14:09.885 --> 00:14:13.623\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Perfect [LAUGH] example of what\n\n277\n00:14:13.623 --> 00:14:15.135\na definition not.\n\n278\n00:14:15.135 --> 00:14:16.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n279\n00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:21.371\na summary is the quickly contrived-\n&gt;&gt; It's hard right?\n\n280\n00:14:21.371 --> 00:14:22.475\n&gt;&gt; It is hard.\n&gt;&gt; What is a summary?\n\n281\n00:14:22.475 --> 00:14:25.742\n&gt;&gt; We're basically taking all the major\npieces of each thing that you want to know\n\n282\n00:14:25.742 --> 00:14:28.335\nabout and put them in a shortly,\ncompact little definition.\n\n283\n00:14:28.335 --> 00:14:30.580\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's consolidated.\n\n284\n00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.511\nWe're gonna add them all up, okay.\n\n285\n00:14:32.511 --> 00:14:36.944\nSo, right here, if I'm doing my,\nthis is supposed to be, by the way,\n\n286\n00:14:36.944 --> 00:14:40.960\nI just realized I did something,\nthe region is supposed to be all.\n\n287\n00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.766\nWhoops, all right, okay,\nso let's just go ahead and\n\n288\n00:14:43.766 --> 00:14:45.969\ncorrect that because this is our summary.\n\n289\n00:14:45.969 --> 00:14:49.461\n&gt;&gt; Is that what these are technically\ncalled, summary sheets, or summaries?\n\n290\n00:14:49.461 --> 00:14:53.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's just a worksheet that we're\nwanting to see all of our yearly totals.\n\n291\n00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:57.293\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so here, this is, and\n\n292\n00:14:57.293 --> 00:15:00.103\nwe could even say summary for\n\n293\n00:15:00.103 --> 00:15:05.620\nthe year of 2017 even\nthough 2017's not done.\n\n294\n00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:10.697\nSo yes, I want to say, in all of our\nquarter, okay, it's quarter one.\n\n295\n00:15:10.697 --> 00:15:11.259\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n296\n00:15:11.259 --> 00:15:16.222\n&gt;&gt; For toys, for all of our regions,\nI want to calculate\n\n297\n00:15:16.222 --> 00:15:20.980\nthe quarter one from the north,\nwe put her at 60.\n\n298\n00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:24.916\nQuarter one from the south,\n32, quarter one from the east.\n\n299\n00:15:24.916 --> 00:15:25.835\nWhere's west?\n\n300\n00:15:25.835 --> 00:15:28.274\nI'm leaving that out on purpose,\nit'll come back.\n\n301\n00:15:28.274 --> 00:15:33.855\nSo we wanna take,\nwhat is this, B6 from east,\n\n302\n00:15:33.855 --> 00:15:37.776\nB6 from south, B6 from north.\n\n303\n00:15:37.776 --> 00:15:39.056\nIs it following a pattern?\n\n304\n00:15:39.056 --> 00:15:40.032\n&gt;&gt; It does seem to be.\n\n305\n00:15:40.032 --> 00:15:44.514\n&gt;&gt; B6 across all three sheets.\n\n306\n00:15:44.514 --> 00:15:46.267\n3D formulas.\n\n307\n00:15:46.267 --> 00:15:51.876\nSo I want to add up,\non my summary worksheet,\n\n308\n00:15:51.876 --> 00:15:58.580\nAll of the B6s across North,\nSouth, and East.\n\n309\n00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:00.790\nSo, I'm starting to write my formula.\n\n310\n00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:02.370\nSo, where's my first place?\n\n311\n00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:06.410\nIt's in the North, notice it's\nwriting the formula at the top.\n\n312\n00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:11.130\nI want this cell, but\n\n313\n00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:16.430\nI want this one cell across\nall three worksheets.\n\n314\n00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:22.849\nSo, you hold your Shift key, single click\non East, and look at what it wrote.\n\n315\n00:16:22.849 --> 00:16:27.950\nAdd up, sum, all of the B6s across.\n\n316\n00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:30.020\n&gt;&gt; North through East, hence the colon.\n\n317\n00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:30.590\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n318\n00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:31.170\n&gt;&gt; Craziest thing ever.\n\n319\n00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:33.140\n&gt;&gt; Look at you you're picking up so well.\n\n320\n00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.190\nAnd how do we accept a function,\nor formula?\n\n321\n00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:36.280\n&gt;&gt; We hit Enter.\n\n322\n00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.710\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so even though you're not\non the right worksheet do it.\n\n323\n00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:39.230\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't matter.\n\n324\n00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:41.810\n&gt;&gt; Boom, there you go.\n\n325\n00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:42.517\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool.\n\n326\n00:16:42.517 --> 00:16:51.150\n&gt;&gt; Now, I have calculated all of the B6s\nacross these one, two, three worksheets.\n\n327\n00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:51.750\nPretty sweet, right?\n\n328\n00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:52.321\n&gt;&gt; Very sweet.\n\n329\n00:16:52.321 --> 00:16:55.150\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so\nthink about how many things you could do.\n\n330\n00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:59.080\nI have the totals in the same\ncell in every worksheet and\n\n331\n00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.900\nI wanna summary it all up.\n\n332\n00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:04.208\nSummarize it, I wanna add it all up,\nthere you go.\n\n333\n00:17:04.208 --> 00:17:06.016\nNow, when you're here, the cool thing is,\n\n334\n00:17:06.016 --> 00:17:08.740\nnow I'll just start using\nrelative reference.\n\n335\n00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:12.059\nWell, now, I wanna go ahead and fill it\nin for all of them, let's go ahead and\n\n336\n00:17:12.059 --> 00:17:13.147\njust pull it all across.\n\n337\n00:17:13.147 --> 00:17:18.254\nAnd there you go,\nadd up all the C6s, all the D6s,\n\n338\n00:17:18.254 --> 00:17:23.220\nall the E6s across these three worksheets.\n\n339\n00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:25.050\nSweet, well then you know\nwhat else you could do?\n\n340\n00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:29.280\nIf you did it here, select them all and\npull them all down, and there you go.\n\n341\n00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.890\n&gt;&gt; It's a beautiful thing,\nisn't it?, it's so neat.\n\n342\n00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:33.060\nI love this.\n\n343\n00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:35.130\nAll right.\nSo, now, I've got all of that, and so,\n\n344\n00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:40.061\nevery one of these quarter,\nquarterly summarizings.\n\n345\n00:17:40.061 --> 00:17:42.440\nWhat?, okay, [LAUGH].\n\n346\n00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.870\n&gt;&gt; Go with that.\n\n347\n00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:45.360\n&gt;&gt; Keep on going.\n\n348\n00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.390\nSo, now, here we could just go ahead and\n\n349\n00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:52.680\nperform a regular sum, cuz remember\nit's pulling from all that other data.\n\n350\n00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:57.680\nRemember that cute little copy that I did,\ncuz this over here,\n\n351\n00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:01.080\nthat's just saying sum of B6 through B9,\nregular auto-sum.\n\n352\n00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.770\nGo ahead and grab all of that.\n\n353\n00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:03.880\nCopy this.\n\n354\n00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:07.590\nCome over here to the summary and\ndo the same thing of pasting it.\n\n355\n00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:08.440\nThere you go.\n\n356\n00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:14.310\nIt's still doing on this worksheet\nsumming up all of our Q1s,\n\n357\n00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:18.120\nbut all of these numbers are pulling\nfrom all of our worksheet.\n\n358\n00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:22.390\nSo, this is our true summary\nof everything across.\n\n359\n00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:26.120\nAnd so, now, I'll just go ahead and\ndo this one easily.\n\n360\n00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:29.698\nI wanna sum up all of our totals here.\n\n361\n00:18:29.698 --> 00:18:32.280\nAnd then do our averages.\n\n362\n00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:38.350\nSo, what were the consolidated\naverages across everything for\n\n363\n00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:42.880\nall of our three regions, and\nthen, the same thing would be over\n\n364\n00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:48.040\nhere to our auto sums, and then,\nlet's pull that down over here.\n\n365\n00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:51.007\nWonderful, so\nthat is our 3D cell reference, but\n\n366\n00:18:51.007 --> 00:18:54.601\nthere's a couple other little\nthings I wanna throw in there.\n\n367\n00:18:54.601 --> 00:18:58.508\nOkay, at one of course, we still\nhave the whole updating, well, oops,\n\n368\n00:18:58.508 --> 00:19:01.432\nthat wasn't 60,000,\nthat was supposed to be.\n\n369\n00:19:01.432 --> 00:19:02.302\n&gt;&gt; 600,000.\n\n370\n00:19:02.302 --> 00:19:03.806\n&gt;&gt; 600,000.\n\n371\n00:19:03.806 --> 00:19:04.819\n&gt;&gt; Someone did great.\n\n372\n00:19:04.819 --> 00:19:06.750\n&gt;&gt; One, two, three,\nfour, okay, there we go.\n\n373\n00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:11.367\nPerfect, changes it on this one worksheet,\nwell, then it's gonna change it there too.\n\n374\n00:19:11.367 --> 00:19:13.412\n&gt;&gt; Someone's getting a bonus this year.\n\n375\n00:19:13.412 --> 00:19:14.003\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\n\n376\n00:19:14.003 --> 00:19:19.440\nAnd that's how we've got there,\nthese are some good sales and everything.\n\n377\n00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:25.660\nBut North, South, East, well, and West.\n\n378\n00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:26.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And West.\n\n379\n00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:27.710\n&gt;&gt; Certainly, you left the west off.\n\n380\n00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:29.270\n&gt;&gt; I did on purpose.\n\n381\n00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:30.675\n&gt;&gt; You don't like the wicked witch of it.\n\n382\n00:19:30.675 --> 00:19:33.081\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n383\n00:19:33.081 --> 00:19:33.614\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n384\n00:19:33.614 --> 00:19:39.290\nI really just wanted to show you\na neat little thing here 3D West.\n\n385\n00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:40.740\nOkay, I just got myself confused.\n\n386\n00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:43.890\nI'm like why did I put,\nthat was in the beginning of the episode.\n\n387\n00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:45.170\nYep, I'm good.\n\n388\n00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:50.990\nSo, right here, [LAUGH], we have the same\nworksheet in a different workbook.\n\n389\n00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:55.411\nEverything's the same, because I\njust wanted to show you this watch.\n\n390\n00:19:55.411 --> 00:19:56.620\nLet me preface this really quick.\n\n391\n00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:03.630\nWhere I'm going here this says,\nour consolidated information.\n\n392\n00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:04.830\nOops, wrong sheet.\n\n393\n00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:08.110\nThis one is North through East.\n\n394\n00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:11.450\nThat means North is the start.\n\n395\n00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:13.559\nEast is the end.\n\n396\n00:20:13.559 --> 00:20:16.350\nIt means, everything else in between it.\n\n397\n00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:21.690\nSo, Daniel, if I want to throw\nin West into all of this.\n\n398\n00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:24.155\nIt's North through East.\n\n399\n00:20:24.155 --> 00:20:25.680\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n400\n00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:29.580\nI would click on the sheet\nthat I wanted to start with.\n\n401\n00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.591\nHold Shift and\nthen click on the end sheet.\n\n402\n00:20:31.591 --> 00:20:33.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, there would be a range of sheets.\n\n403\n00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:34.870\n&gt;&gt; You're on the right track.\n\n404\n00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:35.735\nThat's the range, right?\n\n405\n00:20:35.735 --> 00:20:38.184\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I need that range, right?\n&gt;&gt; It's between north and east, but\n\n406\n00:20:38.184 --> 00:20:40.450\nI want East and I want, wait, West.\n\n407\n00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:40.995\n&gt;&gt; You want West.\n\n408\n00:20:40.995 --> 00:20:43.520\n&gt;&gt; I want West to be part of all of this.\n\n409\n00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.279\n&gt;&gt; West to be [CROSSTALK] all of this.\n\n410\n00:20:44.279 --> 00:20:48.460\n&gt;&gt; I want west to be part of all of this\nto go ahead and calculate everything up.\n\n411\n00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:51.820\nWell, if it's saying every\nsheet between North and\n\n412\n00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:58.160\nEast why don't I come over here to West,\ncopy this,\n\n413\n00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.660\nmove it into this particular workbook?\n\n414\n00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:06.536\nAnd don't move it to the end,\njust make sure it's between what?\n\n415\n00:21:06.536 --> 00:21:07.217\n&gt;&gt; The range.\n\n416\n00:21:07.217 --> 00:21:08.944\n&gt;&gt; Between North and East.\n\n417\n00:21:08.944 --> 00:21:10.023\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, makes sense.\n\n418\n00:21:10.023 --> 00:21:13.574\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I'm gonna throw in,\nnotice I making a copy and\n\n419\n00:21:13.574 --> 00:21:17.515\nputting into another workbook,\nbecause it is already open.\n\n420\n00:21:17.515 --> 00:21:19.755\nWe did this in our essential series.\n\n421\n00:21:19.755 --> 00:21:24.635\nI'm putting it between North and East,\nso I'm gonna move it towards before\n\n422\n00:21:24.635 --> 00:21:29.575\nthe south, I click OK, and then,\nlook at what just happened.\n\n423\n00:21:30.705 --> 00:21:32.818\nOut number,\ncuz it wasn't 3 million before.\n\n424\n00:21:32.818 --> 00:21:33.585\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n425\n00:21:33.585 --> 00:21:38.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because West has\nnow being brought in-between\n\n426\n00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:40.240\n&gt;&gt; North and East, and\n\n427\n00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.560\nthat's what that reference is\nsaying anything between them.\n\n428\n00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:48.270\n&gt;&gt; So, as long as you copy another sheet\ninto the range that has been defined,\n\n429\n00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:48.820\nyou're go to go.\n\n430\n00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:50.720\nIt's kinda just say, yeah,\nthat's inside of that range,\n\n431\n00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.760\nI'm rocking, version numbers.\n\n432\n00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:55.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, nice,\nyou see why I left West out.\n\n433\n00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.055\n&gt;&gt; I see,\nI was wondering what you were doing.\n\n434\n00:21:57.055 --> 00:21:59.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; She's got to put West in, I mean,\n\n435\n00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.130\nit's West.\n\n436\n00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:01.450\nWe couldn't go without West.\n\n437\n00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:06.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, so it's just a whole\nconcept of putting it in that range.\n\n438\n00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:08.520\nIt has to have everything else the same.\n\n439\n00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:12.080\nThat's why all the toys are in row six,\n\n440\n00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:17.130\nthe food is in row nine,\nthe total all of us the exact same place.\n\n441\n00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:19.090\nYou start getting things\nin different places,\n\n442\n00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:23.910\nlike I said before, it breaks\nthe whole cube, or the 3D reference.\n\n443\n00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:24.852\n&gt;&gt; The tesseract.\n\n444\n00:22:24.852 --> 00:22:27.430\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The thing that is making all\n\n445\n00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:28.130\nthis work.\n\n446\n00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:29.990\nIt has to be in the same place.\n\n447\n00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:34.420\nBut super powerful if you have to work\nacross multiple sheets of how you can\n\n448\n00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:35.859\nenter an information.\n\n449\n00:22:35.859 --> 00:22:41.510\nAnd making sure you select that range\nof sheets, making sure you go ahead and\n\n450\n00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:46.279\nget the formulas too add up same\nplaces across multiple sheets,\n\n451\n00:22:46.279 --> 00:22:49.915\nyou can do a lot of awesome,\nneat things with it.\n\n452\n00:22:49.915 --> 00:22:52.755\nSo, I just love that kind of stuff.\n\n453\n00:22:52.755 --> 00:22:56.275\n&gt;&gt; I think it was extremely cool, you did\na great job of showing us how it worked.\n\n454\n00:22:56.275 --> 00:23:00.085\nYou even had a little surprise plot twist\nright at the very end, fun stuff for\n\n455\n00:23:00.085 --> 00:23:05.325\nus to really sink in these concepts\nof working with 3D cells and\n\n456\n00:23:05.325 --> 00:23:07.335\n3D formulas inside of the cells.\n\n457\n00:23:07.335 --> 00:23:08.310\nVery cool stuff.\n\n458\n00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:11.490\nI really, really like it especially,\nbecause of the time saving aspect.\n\n459\n00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:14.810\nI'm all about being as\nlet's put it this way,\n\n460\n00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:17.979\nas little as necessary\nwhen it comes to effort.\n\n461\n00:23:17.979 --> 00:23:20.360\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You want to be efficient.\n\n462\n00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.030\n&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you, yes I do.\n\n463\n00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:23.183\n&gt;&gt; Not lazy.\n\n464\n00:23:23.183 --> 00:23:23.834\n&gt;&gt; A procrastinator [LAUGH].\n\n465\n00:23:23.834 --> 00:23:27.132\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz that's what I'm, sorry.\n\n466\n00:23:27.132 --> 00:23:29.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's who I am.\n\n467\n00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.940\nAll right, Vonne thanks for\njoining us today.\n\n468\n00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:34.260\nAnd we do thank our audience for\nwatching as well.\n\n469\n00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.980\nHopefully you, guys, enjoy this and\ngotten a lot out of it.\n\n470\n00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:39.680\nBut it is time for\nus to sign off for OfficeProTV.\n\n471\n00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.280\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n472\n00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:42.050\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n473\n00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:44.141\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n474\n00:23:44.141 -->

00:00:16.220\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n4\n00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.152\nI'm your host Zach Memos,\nFor Excel functions, and\n\n5\n00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:22.224\nwe're gonna be looking at\nformula auditing right now.\n\n6\n00:00:22.224 --> 00:00:24.942\nAnd the person who's\ngonna help us learn all\n\n7\n00:00:24.942 --> 00:00:29.001\nabout this is our professional\nOffice Pro person, Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:30.089\nThere she is, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n9\n00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:32.963\n[APPLAUSE]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yay, thank you so much.\n\n10\n00:00:32.963 --> 00:00:33.689\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome.\n\n11\n00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:35.067\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So glad to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:35.067 --> 00:00:38.800\nSo yes, we are gonna be talking\nabout formula auditing.\n\n13\n00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.770\nNow, I actually went ahead and\ntitled this episode as such.\n\n14\n00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.888\nBecause this is actually the group name\nin the ribbon under the Formulas tab\n\n15\n00:00:48.888 --> 00:00:53.925\nthat actually kind of incorporates\na whole bunch of different commands or\n\n16\n00:00:53.925 --> 00:00:56.627\ntools that we're gonna be looking at.\n\n17\n00:00:56.627 --> 00:00:58.899\nSo this gonna cover our tray cells,\n\n18\n00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.536\nwe're also gonna be covering the error\nmessages or the error checking.\n\n19\n00:01:03.536 --> 00:01:06.198\nWe're also gonna look at\nthe evaluate formulas, and\n\n20\n00:01:06.198 --> 00:01:08.931\njust really everything\nthat's in that little group.\n\n21\n00:01:08.931 --> 00:01:10.850\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; It is all under, okay,\n\n22\n00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.860\nwell, I'm looking at a formula but\nI don't really know what it's saying.\n\n23\n00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.646\nAnd sometimes, I mean, looking at some\nof these Excel functions and formulas,\n\n24\n00:01:18.646 --> 00:01:21.387\nyou're like,\nthat just looks like complete Greek to me.\n\n25\n00:01:21.387 --> 00:01:22.596\nI do not know what this is pulling from.\n\n26\n00:01:22.596 --> 00:01:26.430\nWhere are these cells,\nhow does this even work?\n\n27\n00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.666\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Greek and it confuses me.\n\n28\n00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:29.799\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah,\nwe've talked about this.\n\n29\n00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.471\nIt's almost like a whole 'nother\nlanguage that's going on here.\n\n30\n00:01:32.471 --> 00:01:34.708\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a whole 'nother language.\n\n31\n00:01:34.708 --> 00:01:38.937\n&gt;&gt; And so I wanna be able to see where is\nthis coming from, where is this going and\n\n32\n00:01:38.937 --> 00:01:42.060\ngive me a little bit of help\nto explain what's going on.\n\n33\n00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.080\nAnd actually,\n\n34\n00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.290\nExcel does a pretty good job of giving\nus some helpful tidbits along the way.\n\n35\n00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.762\nSo that's what I'd like to\nexplore in this episode.\n\n36\n00:01:50.762 --> 00:01:51.830\n&gt;&gt; Please do.\nGo right into it.\n\n37\n00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:52.818\nI wanna find out.\n\n38\n00:01:52.818 --> 00:01:54.614\n&gt;&gt; Well, why don't we go ahead and\njump right it.\n\n39\n00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:55.502\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n\n40\n00:01:55.502 --> 00:01:58.640\n&gt;&gt; So I have a file called Trace and\nEvaluate because, well,\n\n41\n00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.185\nthat's what we're doing.\n\n42\n00:02:00.185 --> 00:02:02.036\nSo I've got this sheet right here.\n\n43\n00:02:02.036 --> 00:02:04.997\nAnd if I'm just looking at this,\nnow I created this, so\n\n44\n00:02:04.997 --> 00:02:07.300\nI have a pretty good understanding.\n\n45\n00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.845\nAnd actually, even looking back at this,\nit's like wait, how did I build this?\n\n46\n00:02:09.845 --> 00:02:12.090\nWhy did I come up with these numbers?\n\n47\n00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.508\nAnd again, this is for\ndemonstration purposes.\n\n48\n00:02:14.508 --> 00:02:17.952\nSo if I'm looking at here,\nI start kind of clicking on some stuff.\n\n49\n00:02:17.952 --> 00:02:19.870\nOkay so the materials, right?\n\n50\n00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.556\nSo we're looking at cat toys basically,\n\n51\n00:02:21.556 --> 00:02:24.461\ncuz of course, we're still in\nChristmas Cats Incorporated, right?\n\n52\n00:02:24.461 --> 00:02:31.140\nSo I have the cost of a toy would be,\nwhat are the materials that we have?\n\n53\n00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.677\nSo I'm looking at, okay,\nthe cost of catnip is $2.\n\n54\n00:02:33.677 --> 00:02:38.145\nAll right, and\nthe fluff that is made out of it is $0.50.\n\n55\n00:02:38.145 --> 00:02:40.350\nSo this is just kind of a materials list.\n\n56\n00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.719\n&gt;&gt; Which is made from recycled plastic\nbags because we are green conscious.\n\n57\n00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:49.048\n&gt;&gt; Well yeah, there is if you look\ndown here, fluff ingredients, right?\n\n58\n00:02:49.048 --> 00:02:51.377\n&gt;&gt; Aha!\n&gt;&gt; I have some cotton, some rayon, and\n\n59\n00:02:51.377 --> 00:02:55.750\nwe do have some synthetic parts of that,\nso that's all totaling up together.\n\n60\n00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.454\nAnd then I have some prices here, but\nhow did I come up with these numbers?\n\n61\n00:02:59.454 --> 00:03:03.450\nNow, we know from other episodes, talking\nabout basic functions and basic formulas,\n\n62\n00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.620\nwhat we always wanna look\nup in the formula bar.\n\n63\n00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.058\nWell, if I start looking at this\nCatnip Mouse, and I start looking at this,\n\n64\n00:03:10.058 --> 00:03:12.366\nyou're like, okay, so\nwhere did that come from?\n\n65\n00:03:12.366 --> 00:03:17.264\nOkay, F3 times F10, absolute reference\nbecause we know about the dollar signs,\n\n66\n00:03:17.264 --> 00:03:18.362\nand then plus F3.\n\n67\n00:03:18.362 --> 00:03:21.789\nWhere's F3, what is that coming from?\n\n68\n00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:26.028\nAnd this fluff that's over here,\nwell, that's not just $0.50,\n\n69\n00:03:26.028 --> 00:03:28.886\nthat's actually summing\nup some other places.\n\n70\n00:03:28.886 --> 00:03:31.514\nAnd this Catnip Mouse materials,\n\n71\n00:03:31.514 --> 00:03:35.689\nthis is where I wanna audit\nwhat my formulas are doing.\n\n72\n00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:39.048\nAnd of course, auditing,\nI always think of taxes, right?\n\n73\n00:03:39.048 --> 00:03:42.310\nYou don't wanna get audited by the IRS but\nit's one of those that they come in and\n\n74\n00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.560\nthey start looking through\nall of your records,\n\n75\n00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.010\nand making sure that,\nwell, everything adds up.\n\n76\n00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.160\nThat's the exact same thing\nwe're gonna be doing here.\n\n77\n00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.280\nWe're gonna audit our formula.\n\n78\n00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.600\nSo on the Formulas tab,\nlike I said before.\n\n79\n00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.900\nHere is a group name of Formula Auditing.\n\n80\n00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.150\nAnd here are the buttons\nthat we're gonna explore.\n\n81\n00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.890\nSo let's start with the trace cells.\n\n82\n00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.176\nTrace precedence, trace dependence,\n[LAUGH] talking about taxes, right?\n\n83\n00:04:08.176 --> 00:04:09.549\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Talking about okay,\n\n84\n00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.382\nif you're gonna claim dependents, right?\n\n85\n00:04:11.382 --> 00:04:14.220\nNormally, if you have children or\nsomebody that you take care of.\n\n86\n00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.790\nSo those are people that\nare attached to you, right?\n\n87\n00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.810\nAnd then precedence, what precedes you,\nthose types of things.\n\n88\n00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.752\nSo the words of how they're actually being\nused are just what we would think of\n\n89\n00:04:26.752 --> 00:04:27.672\nin real life.\n\n90\n00:04:27.672 --> 00:04:33.702\nThings that are below or kind of dependent\non a certain person, or in this case,\n\n91\n00:04:33.702 --> 00:04:39.468\na cell, or this cell that has things\nthat are preceding it, that came to it.\n\n92\n00:04:39.468 --> 00:04:43.980\nAnd basically what it's gonna do is just\nstart translating where it all comes and\n\n93\n00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.420\nshow you the lines.\n\n94\n00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.706\nIt shows you the relationships and\nthe connections between it, all right?\n\n95\n00:04:48.706 --> 00:04:51.310\n&gt;&gt; Ha.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so why don't we go here?\n\n96\n00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.156\nWe're gonna go to the Bunny Mouse,\nall right?\n\n97\n00:04:54.156 --> 00:05:01.710\nSo this is saying that with our\nBunny Mouse, well, what precedes this?\n\n98\n00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.949\nBecause this obviously is a result\nof some type of cells and\n\n99\n00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:07.076\nfunctions and everything like that.\n\n100\n00:05:07.076 --> 00:05:08.110\nSo that's what would go.\n\n101\n00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.511\nSo we're gonna go up here.\n\n102\n00:05:09.511 --> 00:05:12.480\nWe put our cursor on\nthe cell that we want.\n\n103\n00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.596\nAnd we want to either trace\nthe dependents or trace precedents.\n\n104\n00:05:17.596 --> 00:05:19.282\nAnd this is the one\nthat we would wanna do.\n\n105\n00:05:19.282 --> 00:05:23.492\nIf I click on trace precedents,\nnotice that is says for\n\n106\n00:05:23.492 --> 00:05:29.462\nyou to get to this result, you're\nactually using this cell and this cell.\n\n107\n00:05:29.462 --> 00:05:30.490\nCool, so I can see that.\n\n108\n00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.954\nIf you kinda look at this, the price\nof the Bunny Mouse would be the cost of\n\n109\n00:05:35.954 --> 00:05:41.077\nthe Bunny Mouse times the markup,\nthen added back into it, right?\n\n110\n00:05:41.077 --> 00:05:46.208\nAnd that creates the 50% markup of\nthe cost of the toy which is $5.63.\n\n111\n00:05:46.208 --> 00:05:50.710\nSo it's giving me those lines\nof how that's connected.\n\n112\n00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:51.890\nOkay, that's pretty cool.\n\n113\n00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.609\nAt least now I have kind\nof a visual reference,\n\n114\n00:05:54.609 --> 00:05:56.927\nas to what cells are being used in this.\n\n115\n00:05:56.927 --> 00:05:59.704\nAnd if you wanted to remove that,\nyou just go ahead and\n\n116\n00:05:59.704 --> 00:06:03.799\nclear those out because they're not\ngonna affect anything of your formulas.\n\n117\n00:06:03.799 --> 00:06:08.068\nAgain, this is just trying to show you\nwhere things are coming from or going to.\n\n118\n00:06:08.068 --> 00:06:11.731\nSo let's remove those, and that's cool.\n\n119\n00:06:11.731 --> 00:06:15.707\nWell, let's take the Catnip Mouse,\nwell, where does that come from?\n\n120\n00:06:15.707 --> 00:06:20.850\nIf I click on the trace precedents,\nit's pulling from here.\n\n121\n00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.060\nThe cost, the catnip,\n\n122\n00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.820\nthe fluff, and the beads all together\nare summing up to give this result.\n\n123\n00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.567\nSo that's where we're talking about\nthose precedents which could be really\n\n124\n00:06:30.567 --> 00:06:31.266\nquite handy.\n\n125\n00:06:31.266 --> 00:06:32.102\nAnd I'm gonna remove that.\n\n126\n00:06:32.102 --> 00:06:35.303\nNow, that's me just clicking once, okay?\n\n127\n00:06:35.303 --> 00:06:38.757\nWell, this bunny mouse,\nI'll tell you that the Bunny Mouse,\n\n128\n00:06:38.757 --> 00:06:40.875\nlet's do the trace precedence once.\n\n129\n00:06:40.875 --> 00:06:45.018\nSo, okay, it's using this mark up and\nthen the Bunny Mouse.\n\n130\n00:06:45.018 --> 00:06:49.250\nWell, the Bunny Mouse, we know that\nthat cell, that has something on it.\n\n131\n00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.654\nBecause just like the Catnip Mouse or\nthe Bunny Mouse,\n\n132\n00:06:52.654 --> 00:06:55.699\nit is a combination of these materials,\nright?\n\n133\n00:06:55.699 --> 00:06:59.786\nWell, watch what happens if I\nhit the trace precedence again.\n\n134\n00:06:59.786 --> 00:07:04.294\nWell now it's showing me\nthe precedence for the Bunny Mouse.\n\n135\n00:07:04.294 --> 00:07:09.365\nCuz the Bunny Mouse is dependent on or\nhas a precedence of the catnip,\n\n136\n00:07:09.365 --> 00:07:12.347\nthe fluff, the string, and the beads.\n\n137\n00:07:12.347 --> 00:07:13.693\nSo it's used all these materials.\n\n138\n00:07:13.693 --> 00:07:17.201\nWell, I also know, because I built this,\n\n139\n00:07:17.201 --> 00:07:22.181\nthe fluff is really a combination\nof the fluff ingredients.\n\n140\n00:07:22.181 --> 00:07:25.352\nSo if I click the trace precedence\none more time, my gosh, look.\n\n141\n00:07:25.352 --> 00:07:26.352\nIt's kinda like a family tree.\n\n142\n00:07:26.352 --> 00:07:27.706\n&gt;&gt; It's interconnected.\n\n143\n00:07:27.706 --> 00:07:31.350\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's like try and go ahead and\nfind you're grandparents, and\n\n144\n00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:34.155\nyour family tree of how this\nkinda comes down, right?\n\n145\n00:07:34.155 --> 00:07:38.990\nThis is basically a family tree,\nif you wanna say, of all of your formulas.\n\n146\n00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:40.851\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So I can see, cool.\n\n147\n00:07:40.851 --> 00:07:43.408\nAnd if I click it again, whoops,\nthat's the wrong one, sorry.\n\n148\n00:07:43.408 --> 00:07:46.570\n[LAUGH] Then if I click that,\nwell, that's the end of the line.\n\n149\n00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.040\nThat's as far back as we go.\n\n150\n00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:53.041\nWell, the fluff ingredients\ncreate the fluff.\n\n151\n00:07:53.041 --> 00:07:56.574\nThe fluff is part of the Bunny Mouse.\n\n152\n00:07:56.574 --> 00:08:00.834\nThe Bunny Mouse is part of the total\nprice of the Bunny Mouse that we put on\n\n153\n00:08:00.834 --> 00:08:01.548\nthe shelf.\n\n154\n00:08:01.548 --> 00:08:02.058\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n155\n00:08:02.058 --> 00:08:04.371\n&gt;&gt; Sweet,\nI could see where everything comes from.\n\n156\n00:08:04.371 --> 00:08:09.334\nAll right because that was tracing\nthe Precedent, I start from the end and\n\n157\n00:08:09.334 --> 00:08:10.382\ngo backwards.\n\n158\n00:08:10.382 --> 00:08:13.708\nNow if I remove these arrows,\nI'm gonna take these off,\n\n159\n00:08:13.708 --> 00:08:15.658\nwe could go the other way, okay?\n\n160\n00:08:15.658 --> 00:08:18.930\nCuz we're talking about the synthetic,\nright, okay?\n\n161\n00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:25.270\nSo we'll take the synthetic, this is a\ncell that other things are dependent upon.\n\n162\n00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:28.227\nSo here we go,\nwe're going to go with the dependent.\n\n163\n00:08:28.227 --> 00:08:32.590\nThere we go,\nsynthetic is part of the fluff.\n\n164\n00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:37.908\nIf I go click it again, well that goes\nover the fluff is in the catnip and\n\n165\n00:08:37.908 --> 00:08:41.250\nmouse or catnip mouse and bunny mouse.\n\n166\n00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.500\nClick it again, those are connected.\n\n167\n00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:47.510\nThose cells are then used in\nthe catnip mouse and the bunny mouse.\n\n168\n00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:50.820\nAnd they're also used in\nthe outside cost plus materials.\n\n169\n00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.542\nI click it one more time, okay,\nthat's the end of the road.\n\n170\n00:08:53.542 --> 00:09:00.381\nSo it's starting, and seeing where this is\nused, or ending, and where it comes from.\n\n171\n00:09:00.381 --> 00:09:01.423\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, right, right.\n\n172\n00:09:01.423 --> 00:09:04.570\n&gt;&gt; So that can be really,\nreally handy when you're just trying to.\n\n173\n00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:07.204\nNow, I used,\nI tried to use pretty simple ones,\n\n174\n00:09:07.204 --> 00:09:11.520\njust like this plus this divided by that,\nand so on and so forth.\n\n175\n00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:16.290\nBut when you get in to super complex\none this can make a huge difference of\n\n176\n00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:20.400\ntrying to find out, bounce out whatever\neverything is, just use the line.\n\n177\n00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:25.439\nI'm a little bit more of a visual person\nmyself, so I like seeing how this works.\n\n178\n00:09:25.439 --> 00:09:29.050\nSo pretty neat stuff,\nwith the precedence and dependence.\n\n179\n00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:33.012\nAnd notice if I went back to that bunny\nmouse, and then did the precedence.\n\n180\n00:09:33.012 --> 00:09:36.040\nYou can see it's just making\nthe same arrows, the same colors.\n\n181\n00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:40.300\nSo this is where you wanna try to\nnot confuse yourself too much.\n\n182\n00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:41.830\nSo just remove your arrows,\n\n183\n00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:46.460\nbut notice you could remove just the\nprecedence, or just the dependence there.\n\n184\n00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.360\nAnd so you could keep whichever\narrows you wanted to go into.\n\n185\n00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.680\nSo I love doing that,\nit's nice to be able to see this.\n\n186\n00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.120\nI also touched upon this and,\nI think it's the basic formulas in here.\n\n187\n00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:00.832\nSo if you're like, you saw me do\nthis before, you're right, I did.\n\n188\n00:10:00.832 --> 00:10:04.332\n[LAUGH] I had to also kind of segment out\nbecause that was just one little part of\n\n189\n00:10:04.332 --> 00:10:05.327\na separate episode.\n\n190\n00:10:05.327 --> 00:10:09.432\nSo separating this out as to how\nyou can audit your formulas.\n\n191\n00:10:09.432 --> 00:10:11.039\n&gt;&gt; And Vonne,\nI can see how this has been very helpful\n\n192\n00:10:11.039 --> 00:10:12.379\ntoo if you were in a presentation.\n\n193\n00:10:12.379 --> 00:10:13.049\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n194\n00:10:13.049 --> 00:10:17.974\n&gt;&gt; Being able to connect the dots quickly,\nthis is how we got to this figure here.\n\n195\n00:10:17.974 --> 00:10:22.552\n&gt;&gt; I didn't even think of it that way but\nthat's an amazing example.\n\n196\n00:10:22.552 --> 00:10:27.924\nBecause yeah, there's a lot of times where\nyou as somebody who is doing the numbers,\n\n197\n00:10:27.924 --> 00:10:31.070\nI need to present this to the board,\nor whatever.\n\n198\n00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:33.137\nWow, awesome, I like that, good job.\n\n199\n00:10:33.137 --> 00:10:36.125\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I would like to be the CEO now.\n\n200\n00:10:36.125 --> 00:10:37.609\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, right?\n\n201\n00:10:37.609 --> 00:10:39.512\nI'll let you make\nthe decisions from now on.\n\n202\n00:10:39.512 --> 00:10:40.711\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n203\n00:10:40.711 --> 00:10:43.014\ntracing is one way that we could go ahead.\n\n204\n00:10:43.014 --> 00:10:47.870\nNow I wanted to go ahead and\npoint out the outside costs here.\n\n205\n00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:51.960\nSo let me go to this,\nthe Catnip Mouse right here.\n\n206\n00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:55.063\nSo if I click on the precedence here,\n\n207\n00:10:55.063 --> 00:10:59.676\nI get a new thing that we\nhadn't seen in the other ones.\n\n208\n00:10:59.676 --> 00:11:02.191\nThese are the blue lines\nthat are connected.\n\n209\n00:11:02.191 --> 00:11:05.363\nBut then I get this dotted black line.\n\n210\n00:11:05.363 --> 00:11:08.267\nWhat that means is that I have numbers or\n\n211\n00:11:08.267 --> 00:11:13.817\ncell references within this particular\nformula that are not in this file.\n\n212\n00:11:13.817 --> 00:11:18.475\nAnd you could actually see here,\nnotice it says that it is F3+.\n\n213\n00:11:18.475 --> 00:11:23.302\nAnd then an absolute\nreference to a whole other\n\n214\n00:11:23.302 --> 00:11:28.391\nfile outside cost.xlsx in Sheet1, cell A4.\n\n215\n00:11:28.391 --> 00:11:31.618\nSo that is gonna be an indication\nthat you have outside or\n\n216\n00:11:31.618 --> 00:11:34.580\ncells that are in other files,\ncuz you can do that.\n\n217\n00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:38.790\nYou can create formulas that\nare going across multiple workbooks,\n\n218\n00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.540\nnot just within the same workbook.\n\n219\n00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:45.460\nSo that's one that if you get right on\nthe actual line and double-click it.\n\n220\n00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:48.138\nIt bring us to your Go To box.\n\n221\n00:11:48.138 --> 00:11:50.372\nAnd you're like okay let me go ahead and\nsee this.\n\n222\n00:11:50.372 --> 00:11:52.573\nSo you click on the Go To and\nyou click OK.\n\n223\n00:11:52.573 --> 00:11:56.730\nAnd then that's gonna say, hey this is\ninvalid, and you're like wait, it isn't?\n\n224\n00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:03.700\nIt is, the only problem about doing this,\nyou would have to open the workbook up.\n\n225\n00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.620\nIt can't just like open the workbook\nfrom this particular dialog box.\n\n226\n00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.709\nBut at least it does tell\nme that it's outside costs.\n\n227\n00:12:10.709 --> 00:12:16.890\nSo I know that I have a file called\noutside costs out here on my desktop.\n\n228\n00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:19.822\nLet me go ahead and open that up.\n\n229\n00:12:19.822 --> 00:12:23.771\nAnd then it's just one cell for\nthis particular example.\n\n230\n00:12:23.771 --> 00:12:27.890\nSo now that I have it open,\nlet me switch back over to that file.\n\n231\n00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:33.490\nDouble click on that little line of\nour precedent, select that Go To.\n\n232\n00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:40.540\nClick OK and then it will jump to the\nactual reference in this particular file.\n\n233\n00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:42.626\nJust the key is you've\ngotta have it opened.\n\n234\n00:12:42.626 --> 00:12:46.103\nOtherwise it's gonna tell you\nthis isn't valid, but it is.\n\n235\n00:12:46.103 --> 00:12:52.051\nSo just a little thing to point out and\nto see if you ever see those dotted lines.\n\n236\n00:12:52.051 --> 00:12:56.186\nThat's why I called it outside costs,\nto try a different file.\n\n237\n00:12:56.186 --> 00:12:56.941\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n238\n00:12:56.941 --> 00:12:59.730\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, now some other things that\nyou can do, and let me go ahead and\n\n239\n00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:00.980\nremove those errors.\n\n240\n00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.910\nIf you're looking at some things,\nand you're like,\n\n241\n00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:05.550\nwell how did they\ndetermine these formulas?\n\n242\n00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:10.420\nThere is that Show Formulas button that's\nright here, which will do exactly that.\n\n243\n00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:11.460\nIf you go ahead and\n\n244\n00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:15.740\nclick on it, notice that it will go\nahead and expand out in the cells.\n\n245\n00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:20.650\nBut it's showing you those\nparticular formulas and functions.\n\n246\n00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:25.730\nSo this is just B7+B5 and then, of course,\nclicking on it gets the color coding.\n\n247\n00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:29.043\nAnd then clicking here will show you\nwhich one, where it's going, and so\n\n248\n00:13:29.043 --> 00:13:29.692\nand so forth.\n\n249\n00:13:29.692 --> 00:13:32.082\nSo being able to show\nthe formula is just kinda nice.\n\n250\n00:13:32.082 --> 00:13:35.748\nBut notice that there is a shortcut,\nthe Ctrl+tilde,\n\n251\n00:13:35.748 --> 00:13:38.011\nor the Ctrl+accent right there.\n\n252\n00:13:38.011 --> 00:13:41.528\nThat's where I had people,\nI don't know what I hit, but\n\n253\n00:13:41.528 --> 00:13:44.546\nsomehow now I'm showing\nformulas everywhere.\n\n254\n00:13:44.546 --> 00:13:46.262\nThis is where you can turn it off, okay?\n\n255\n00:13:46.262 --> 00:13:50.097\nSo if it throws you off a little bit,\na lot of people do it by mistake.\n\n256\n00:13:50.097 --> 00:13:53.910\nNot on purpose, and that's where you\nlearn, hey, that's what that is.\n\n257\n00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:57.847\nSo we have our Show Formulas that\ncan give you a little bit of help.\n\n258\n00:13:57.847 --> 00:14:01.550\nAll right, errors, [LAUGH] errors.\n\n259\n00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:03.302\n[SOUND] Wrong, bad.\n\n260\n00:14:03.302 --> 00:14:05.125\n&gt;&gt; We don't make no stinking mistakes.\n\n261\n00:14:05.125 --> 00:14:07.173\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Never, [LAUGH] yeah, so\n\n262\n00:14:07.173 --> 00:14:09.440\nwe've got some different ones here.\n\n263\n00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:14.060\nAnd I have pulled up a website that\ngives you a lot of references,\n\n264\n00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:15.540\nDetect errors in formulas.\n\n265\n00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.090\nThis is in the show notes so\ndefinitely check that out.\n\n266\n00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:21.962\nAnd it does have a list of the things\nthat I'm going to just kind of brush upon\n\n267\n00:14:21.962 --> 00:14:22.892\na couple of them.\n\n268\n00:14:22.892 --> 00:14:26.349\nBut notice that there's a whole bunch\nof different things that they have\n\n269\n00:14:26.349 --> 00:14:28.967\nin this particular help file\nthat can be very helpful.\n\n270\n00:14:28.967 --> 00:14:29.537\n&gt;&gt; Indeed.\n\n271\n00:14:29.537 --> 00:14:31.335\n&gt;&gt; So we've got ones that happen.\n\n272\n00:14:31.335 --> 00:14:34.547\nWe've talked about\nthe number signs in a cell.\n\n273\n00:14:34.547 --> 00:14:36.598\nThat just means that it's too short,\n\n274\n00:14:36.598 --> 00:14:39.363\nor it's not wide enough to\ndisplay all the values.\n\n275\n00:14:39.363 --> 00:14:43.937\nAnd then there's some other ones that\nwe're going to display here in this\n\n276\n00:14:43.937 --> 00:14:45.130\nparticular file.\n\n277\n00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:50.157\nAll right, so the ones right here,\nnow if you see things with a,\n\n278\n00:14:50.157 --> 00:14:53.408\nif you see a cell with a green\ntriangle on the corner.\n\n279\n00:14:53.408 --> 00:14:58.610\nThat means that there is some\ntype of error that's going on,\n\n280\n00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:01.474\nand notice you have a null value.\n\n281\n00:15:01.474 --> 00:15:04.824\nI think there's one over here with NAME,\nso what does that mean?\n\n282\n00:15:04.824 --> 00:15:09.022\nI don't understand,\nwell if I start with the VALUE one.\n\n283\n00:15:09.022 --> 00:15:11.754\nThe Catnip Mouse right here, oops sorry.\n\n284\n00:15:11.754 --> 00:15:14.155\nIf I click here and\nthis one I'm trying to go [LAUGH].\n\n285\n00:15:14.155 --> 00:15:20.567\nIt's got that it is doing F3 times F10.\n\n286\n00:15:20.567 --> 00:15:25.433\nAnd if I click here it's gonna show there,\nI'm trying to give you the thing.\n\n287\n00:15:25.433 --> 00:15:30.249\nYou can't multiply times a slash,\nor it's using an operator.\n\n288\n00:15:30.249 --> 00:15:32.644\nSo that's just saying,\nhey something's wrong here.\n\n289\n00:15:32.644 --> 00:15:34.800\nAnd the thing is like,\nhey I don't know what that is.\n\n290\n00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:40.119\nYou click on this, it actually gives you\na lot of things that'll tell you that.\n\n291\n00:15:40.119 --> 00:15:42.289\nHelp on this Error,\nit goes out to a website.\n\n292\n00:15:42.289 --> 00:15:46.940\nShow Calculation Steps, and this actually\ngets into the evaluate dialog box.\n\n293\n00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.300\nBut notice it's like, there's an error.\n\n294\n00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:53.132\nIt's actually trying to show\nyou that 3 times a slash,\n\n295\n00:15:53.132 --> 00:15:55.833\nyou can't do that, it doesn't work.\n\n296\n00:15:55.833 --> 00:16:00.823\nSo that's why it's saying that there\nis a value error within this particular\n\n297\n00:16:00.823 --> 00:16:01.521\nformula.\n\n298\n00:16:01.521 --> 00:16:02.753\nWell then my markup's wrong.\n\n299\n00:16:02.753 --> 00:16:07.842\nIf I just type in 50% there\nThat corrected it, perfect.\n\n300\n00:16:07.842 --> 00:16:10.091\nOkay, so there's my problem.\n\n301\n00:16:10.091 --> 00:16:12.815\nThis one over here where it says name.\n\n302\n00:16:12.815 --> 00:16:17.414\nOkay, well, if I click on that,\nwhat's the problem on here?\n\n303\n00:16:17.414 --> 00:16:22.596\nWell, if you look at that, Sume, no.\n\n304\n00:16:22.596 --> 00:16:24.682\n[LAUGH] Sum is just.\n\n305\n00:16:24.682 --> 00:16:26.492\n&gt;&gt; Sum maybe.\n\n306\n00:16:26.492 --> 00:16:28.066\n&gt;&gt; Sume doesn't work.\n\n307\n00:16:28.066 --> 00:16:30.010\nSume is not a name function,\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n308\n00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:31.850\n&gt;&gt; Within Excel.\n\n309\n00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:35.587\nSo that's basically saying that you\nhave a name problem, the formula or\n\n310\n00:16:35.587 --> 00:16:36.641\nthe function name.\n\n311\n00:16:36.641 --> 00:16:41.531\nSo if I came out here and\ngot rid of the E, and then just hit Enter,\n\n312\n00:16:41.531 --> 00:16:42.989\nthen it would fix.\n\n313\n00:16:42.989 --> 00:16:44.389\nThese are very basic ones and\n\n314\n00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:47.530\nvery similar ones, but\nyou are going to find this a lot.\n\n315\n00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:50.870\nFor example, this one right over here,\n\n316\n00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:56.385\nlet's see that this says, okay,\nit says B25 divided by C24.\n\n317\n00:16:56.385 --> 00:16:59.182\nSo what's the problem here?\n\n318\n00:16:59.182 --> 00:17:02.830\nWell, in this sense, this is a problem\nof absolute reference, okay?\n\n319\n00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:07.119\nSo we wanted to say that, okay,\nwell, the production cost is $30,000.\n\n320\n00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:12.294\nSo the cost per toy would be\nthe production cost divided by the amount,\n\n321\n00:17:12.294 --> 00:17:15.728\nor the amount divided\nby the production cost.\n\n322\n00:17:15.728 --> 00:17:17.270\nAnd that's how you get there.\n\n323\n00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:19.510\nWell, this is a relative\nreference problem.\n\n324\n00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:25.690\nIs that this one is referencing\nCB25 which is right there,\n\n325\n00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:31.200\nbut it's also doing C24, so\nit's doing the wrong reference.\n\n326\n00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.950\nIt just needs to have\nan absolute reference in there.\n\n327\n00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:36.629\nSo that's where we have\na problem with that one.\n\n328\n00:17:36.629 --> 00:17:40.990\nIf I took this and said, all right,\nso let's go ahead and click here.\n\n329\n00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:47.228\nI want the production costs to go down,\nor sorry, the production amount, but\n\n330\n00:17:47.228 --> 00:17:53.012\nthe production cost, which is C22,\nthat has to be an absolute value.\n\n331\n00:17:53.012 --> 00:17:58.698\nSo if I put that there, and then copy\nit down, now I don't have a problem.\n\n332\n00:17:58.698 --> 00:18:00.022\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; Is good.\n\n333\n00:18:00.022 --> 00:18:00.692\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so\n\n334\n00:18:00.692 --> 00:18:04.220\nyou have these different things\nthat'll happen all the time.\n\n335\n00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:08.227\nThe forgetting to absolute reference\n\n336\n00:18:08.227 --> 00:18:12.993\na value in my formula,\nI do that all the time.\n\n337\n00:18:12.993 --> 00:18:17.132\nI'm like, those numbers don't work,\nand then I'm like, no,\n\n338\n00:18:17.132 --> 00:18:20.640\nI wanted to say, go ahead and\ndivide by this every time.\n\n339\n00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.160\nThis divided by this,\nthis divided by this.\n\n340\n00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:26.319\nSo I write the first time and\nforget to absolute reference it,\n\n341\n00:18:26.319 --> 00:18:27.487\nI do that all the time.\n\n342\n00:18:27.487 --> 00:18:31.530\nSo letting you know that, yep, it happens.\n\n343\n00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:32.560\nSo what's this one over here?\n\n344\n00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:36.330\nOkay, this null one right here,\nwhere it says the catnip mouse.\n\n345\n00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:41.696\nThis is where it's kind of like can you\nfind the error, what is wrong here?\n\n346\n00:18:41.696 --> 00:18:47.522\nWell, in the sum, remember we talked\na lot about the colon is the range.\n\n347\n00:18:47.522 --> 00:18:51.302\nThe comma would be like an and, so\n\n348\n00:18:51.302 --> 00:18:57.790\nwe're saying sum up B13 through B15 and\nB3 and B6.\n\n349\n00:18:57.790 --> 00:18:59.079\nI forgot a comma.\n\n350\n00:18:59.079 --> 00:19:00.936\nSo this is a syntax error.\n\n351\n00:19:00.936 --> 00:19:04.121\n&gt;&gt; So this is where I took this and\nput a comma, and\n\n352\n00:19:04.121 --> 00:19:06.588\nthen watch this one back over here.\n\n353\n00:19:06.588 --> 00:19:10.790\nIf it goes ahead and I hit Enter,\nthen it goes ahead and corrects itself.\n\n354\n00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:11.509\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n355\n00:19:11.509 --> 00:19:12.013\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n356\n00:19:12.013 --> 00:19:17.070\nI mean that's the nice thing that if you\ndon't know what's wrong with your formula.\n\n357\n00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:21.330\nI mean, I'm showing you like the\ncorrections on a very simple level, but\n\n358\n00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:25.800\nuse the reference here of what are the\ndifferent errors which would that help\n\n359\n00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.300\non the error will go with it.\n\n360\n00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit's great that that's available, too.\n\n361\n00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:33.740\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and the other thing is\nwhen you have those errors that come out,\n\n362\n00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:36.954\nuse this drop-down right here and\nshow the steps.\n\n363\n00:19:36.954 --> 00:19:40.665\nTell me what's wrong and then our edit in\nthe formula bar, that's just going and\n\n364\n00:19:40.665 --> 00:19:41.548\nhighlighting it.\n\n365\n00:19:41.548 --> 00:19:45.225\nAnd then using the colors that come\nout from highlighting your cells,\n\n366\n00:19:45.225 --> 00:19:46.920\nthat can really, really help.\n\n367\n00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:50.024\nSo it's kind of one of those,\nokay, let me just look at this.\n\n368\n00:19:50.024 --> 00:19:53.064\nI mean, look at the error,\nwhat's wrong with it?\n\n369\n00:19:53.064 --> 00:19:54.056\nTell me what it is.\n\n370\n00:19:54.056 --> 00:19:58.638\nAnd then Excel will usually try to\nhelp you along the way of telling you\n\n371\n00:19:58.638 --> 00:19:59.751\nwhat's wrong.\n\n372\n00:19:59.751 --> 00:20:02.630\nCouple other areas that I always run into.\n\n373\n00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:07.660\nThis is one right here to where\nyou see the ZIP code, okay?\n\n374\n00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:11.799\nWell, ZIP codes, I have a lot of ZIP\ncodes that start with zeros, right?\n\n375\n00:20:11.799 --> 00:20:16.006\nAnd so what I would have to do\nis I'd have to change the cell\n\n376\n00:20:16.006 --> 00:20:18.980\nformatting of the cells to be as text.\n\n377\n00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:22.860\nNotice right here, if I go to home,\nI format my entire column.\n\n378\n00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:26.298\nAnytime I have a ZIP code or anything that\nneeds to start with a preceding zero,\n\n379\n00:20:26.298 --> 00:20:29.790\nI usually go ahead and format as text,\nbecause I don't wanna have to worry about\n\n380\n00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:31.793\ndoing number formats or\nanything like that.\n\n381\n00:20:31.793 --> 00:20:34.926\nWe've talked about this in other\nepisodes outside of this show.\n\n382\n00:20:34.926 --> 00:20:39.718\nThis is in, I believe,\nthe Excel Essentials.\n\n383\n00:20:39.718 --> 00:20:40.434\nWow, that's hard to say.\n\n384\n00:20:40.434 --> 00:20:41.454\n&gt;&gt; Excel Essentials.\n\n385\n00:20:41.454 --> 00:20:44.180\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH] that's where we\ntalk about number format, but\n\n386\n00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:45.277\nI get this all the time.\n\n387\n00:20:45.277 --> 00:20:48.830\nAnd it throws me an error that says,\nhey, there's something wrong with this.\n\n388\n00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:53.090\nThere's nothing wrong with this, but\nwhat it's showing if I click on this and\n\n389\n00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:58.620\nclick on the error smart tag, it's saying,\nhey, the number, it's a number.\n\n390\n00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:02.432\nI see it as a number, but\nyou're telling me it's text.\n\n391\n00:21:02.432 --> 00:21:04.180\nAre you sure you want that to be text?\n\n392\n00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.799\nSo Excel's trying to be helpful here.\n\n393\n00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:10.471\nIt's smart enough to say that's not text.\n\n394\n00:21:10.471 --> 00:21:12.343\nSo maybe that's your problem.\n\n395\n00:21:12.343 --> 00:21:15.782\nA lot of times, no,\nthat's not the problem in Excel.\n\n396\n00:21:15.782 --> 00:21:17.790\nI'm good, thank you.\n\n397\n00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:20.500\nI really want you to\njust ignore this error.\n\n398\n00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:24.050\nSo the ones that were like, actually\nhaving an error, where it's like, hey,\n\n399\n00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:25.370\nhelp me, okay, great.\n\n400\n00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:29.610\nBut sometimes I don't need\nyou to be that helpful, so\n\n401\n00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:33.200\nignoring an error will just get\nthe green triangle off of it.\n\n402\n00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.800\nNow this is one of those things,\nand I've said this before,\n\n403\n00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.510\nif you can just live with the green arrow,\nlike I know that's not wrong.\n\n404\n00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:40.540\nI know I'm right.\n\n405\n00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:45.080\nIt's okay, cuz I don't wanna have\nto take the green arrows out.\n\n406\n00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.250\nThen just leave them there,\nthey're not gonna do anything to you.\n\n407\n00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:49.193\nThey're not gonna do\nanything to your numbers.\n\n408\n00:21:49.193 --> 00:21:52.930\nWell, I guess in a sense your text,\ncuz that's how we formatted it.\n\n409\n00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:56.860\nSo it's really more of if this just\ndrives you crazy, then just go ahead and\n\n410\n00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:00.810\nselect them all and just tell them\nto just ignore the error, all right?\n\n411\n00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:07.479\nSo great that it checks, sometimes it\ndoesn't need to be doing that, all right?\n\n412\n00:22:07.479 --> 00:22:08.976\nSo that's something we can do.\n\n413\n00:22:08.976 --> 00:22:10.119\n&gt;&gt; Kinda like your picky Uncle Herbert.\n\n414\n00:22:10.119 --> 00:22:11.967\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n415\n00:22:11.967 --> 00:22:13.645\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like [SOUND], no.\n\n416\n00:22:13.645 --> 00:22:15.557\n&gt;&gt; Just be quiet,\nUncle Herbert, just be quiet.\n\n417\n00:22:15.557 --> 00:22:17.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just ignore him.\n\n418\n00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:20.714\nHe'll be fine, he just keeps talking but\nyou just go, uh-huh, great.\n\n419\n00:22:20.714 --> 00:22:26.501\n[LAUGH] And then just one more thing back\non this for example here this null value.\n\n420\n00:22:26.501 --> 00:22:28.590\nAnd you go back into the error checking.\n\n421\n00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:33.600\nThis is where if you do have errors,\nit will go through each one of them, and\n\n422\n00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.909\nI have corrected quite a few of them,\nbut it says right there,\n\n423\n00:22:36.909 --> 00:22:39.287\nthe ranges in the formula\ndo not intersect.\n\n424\n00:22:39.287 --> 00:22:43.723\nWell, that still doesn't say you have\nsyntax error, but it is telling you that.\n\n425\n00:22:43.723 --> 00:22:46.590\nAnd you can see the calculation steps.\n\n426\n00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:48.240\nIt kinda jumps into here.\n\n427\n00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:53.110\nThe next evaluation will result in\nan error, cuz it doesn't understand it.\n\n428\n00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:55.718\nSo it's even sometimes will help you,\nI still don't get it.\n\n429\n00:22:55.718 --> 00:22:57.593\n[LAUGH] It takes practice, and\n\n430\n00:22:57.593 --> 00:23:01.270\nit takes just recognizing how\nthat kind of works in there.\n\n431\n00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:02.240\nSo you can go through and\n\n432\n00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:07.900\nactually do an error check where it will\ngo to each error that's in your worksheet.\n\n433\n00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:11.170\nI probably should have done that first\nbefore I started correcting them all.\n\n434\n00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:14.070\nSo that's one that you can do.\n\n435\n00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:16.310\nAll right, a couple more things.\n\n436\n00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:19.410\nI get this all the time, okay?\n\n437\n00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:22.223\nMy reference error, this is a big one.\n\n438\n00:23:22.223 --> 00:23:25.563\nAnd a lot of times this happens,\nfor example,\n\n439\n00:23:25.563 --> 00:23:30.112\nI wanted to copy over the cost of\nthe toys, back over from here.\n\n440\n00:23:30.112 --> 00:23:33.830\nI just wanted to take this and\ncopy it over to another worksheet.\n\n441\n00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:39.415\nAnd just use that for data, just regular\ndata to go ahead and do other things on.\n\n442\n00:23:39.415 --> 00:23:43.206\nBut when I copy it and\nI paste it, just like this,\n\n443\n00:23:43.206 --> 00:23:47.660\nis that it's going,\nI don't understand my reference.\n\n444\n00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:52.890\nCuz remember this, what was it, $3.50?\n\n445\n00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:57.875\nIt's a formula, so this cell has\nactually got its presence, right?\n\n446\n00:23:57.875 --> 00:24:00.509\nIt has other cells that it made this from.\n\n447\n00:24:00.509 --> 00:24:02.509\nI come over here to a new worksheet,\n\n448\n00:24:02.509 --> 00:24:06.924\nit's like It's trying to reference\nthese cells and it doesn't understand.\n\n449\n00:24:06.924 --> 00:24:08.500\nIt's like, no.\n\n450\n00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:10.390\nIt's not there.\n\n451\n00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:11.910\nThis is where it's like, you know what?\n\n452\n00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:16.960\nI really didn't want that information\nwith the calculation in it.\n\n453\n00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:21.443\nJust wanted it to show the 350 and\nwhatever other cost of the mouse is.\n\n454\n00:24:21.443 --> 00:24:27.023\nSo what you really probably need to do\nis you need to paste this as values,\n\n455\n00:24:27.023 --> 00:24:32.640\njust values, not your formulas and\nthen that's what I really wanted.\n\n456\n00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:36.877\nI really just wanted $3.50 to $3.25,\n$3.75.\n\n457\n00:24:36.877 --> 00:24:40.528\nSo, hopefully a few of you\nout there are going, my gosh,\n\n458\n00:24:40.528 --> 00:24:43.830\nyes it's exactly what I do and\nthat's what happens.\n\n459\n00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:48.649\nFor example this one with the full name,\nthe names over here of Puma Princess,\n\n460\n00:24:48.649 --> 00:24:50.559\nSasha Cat and Bishop Timothy.\n\n461\n00:24:50.559 --> 00:24:54.835\nThey are not just straight names, they're\nactually a result of a concatenation of\n\n462\n00:24:54.835 --> 00:24:58.756\nyour first and last name with a space\nin between it, and that's the result.\n\n463\n00:24:58.756 --> 00:25:01.529\nYou really just want the data as data.\n\n464\n00:25:01.529 --> 00:25:07.134\nThat's where the copying and pasting,\nI'll just put it right here,\n\n465\n00:25:07.134 --> 00:25:10.465\npaste as values will remove that, okay?\n\n466\n00:25:10.465 --> 00:25:12.628\nI do that a lot too, guys, so it's okay.\n\n467\n00:25:12.628 --> 00:25:17.030\n[LAUGH] So the reference, It's trying\nto reference out to a cell that's in\n\n468\n00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:20.350\nthe result of that formula\nthat doesn't exist.\n\n469\n00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:22.940\nOr in this sense,\nit's trying to reference itself, and\n\n470\n00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:25.760\nthat's where it's a straight\nup real reference.\n\n471\n00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:30.220\nIt's saying you were referencing B6,\nbut now I'm in B6.\n\n472\n00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:32.538\nI am spinning out of control.\n\n473\n00:25:32.538 --> 00:25:34.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, ask the right question.\n\n474\n00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:34.959\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\nwe don't want you spinning out of control.\n\n475\n00:25:34.959 --> 00:25:37.578\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, no, no,\nno, no, that would be bad.\n\n476\n00:25:37.578 --> 00:25:42.030\nAnd the last thing I'd like to end\noff with is evaluating a formula.\n\n477\n00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:47.390\nYour formulas the way they're written\ncan be a little confusing, I know.\n\n478\n00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:49.287\nFor example, this is an if formula.\n\n479\n00:25:49.287 --> 00:25:53.694\nSo if we're talking it out,\njust speaking in normal terms.\n\n480\n00:25:53.694 --> 00:25:55.665\nThis is something that\nhappens a lot in businesses.\n\n481\n00:25:55.665 --> 00:25:58.597\nAll right, we have our sales figures okay?\n\n482\n00:25:58.597 --> 00:26:00.880\nSo in our January if it totals up.\n\n483\n00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.990\nThis January sales were 489.\n\n484\n00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:05.840\nWell, in our business\nof Cats Incorporated,\n\n485\n00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:09.139\nwe have a goal that you\nwere needing to sell $500.\n\n486\n00:26:09.139 --> 00:26:15.025\nOr if there's a $500 monthly total, then\neverybody gets a bonus of 25%, or there's\n\n487\n00:26:15.025 --> 00:26:20.390\n25% on top of that total, and then it gets\nredistributed or so and so forth right.\n\n488\n00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:25.241\nSo that's something if you make this,\nthe you get this,\n\n489\n00:26:25.241 --> 00:26:27.882\nbut if you don't you get that.\n\n490\n00:26:27.882 --> 00:26:31.625\nWow, [LAUGH] so we've got some here.\n\n491\n00:26:31.625 --> 00:26:36.162\nAnd this result right here,\nnotice that 49 does that meet our goal?\n\n492\n00:26:36.162 --> 00:26:37.190\nNo.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n493\n00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:38.949\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna get a bonus, are we?\n\n494\n00:26:38.949 --> 00:26:40.320\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; So did we get a bonus?\n\n495\n00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.930\nNope, we sure didn't.\n\n496\n00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:44.530\nThis right here, it's $1000.\n\n497\n00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:51.554\nThat is meeting our bonus, so then we\nwould take 25% of $1000 which is $250.\n\n498\n00:26:51.554 --> 00:26:55.020\nThen altogether, we would have a total,\nI guess that should be total plus bonus.\n\n499\n00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:58.813\nIt would be $1250, right?\n\n500\n00:26:58.813 --> 00:27:01.945\nSo when we're talking it up, sure.\n\n501\n00:27:01.945 --> 00:27:06.174\nYou look at this up here on this\nformula bar and you're like, what?\n\n502\n00:27:06.174 --> 00:27:09.593\n[LAUGH] That's really confusing.\n\n503\n00:27:09.593 --> 00:27:12.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a lot of\nlittle scratches up there.\n\n504\n00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:16.098\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There's nicks and\nscratches and dollar signs.\n\n505\n00:27:16.098 --> 00:27:20.466\nAll right, so this is where if\nyou take the result yourself and\n\n506\n00:27:20.466 --> 00:27:22.902\nyou go into the evaluate formula,\n\n507\n00:27:22.902 --> 00:27:28.770\nit's gonna just kind of help you along and\nstep you through the process.\n\n508\n00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:33.262\nSo it says, okay, show the result of\nthe underlined expression, click Evaluate.\n\n509\n00:27:33.262 --> 00:27:35.148\nOkay, well that says, if D10.\n\n510\n00:27:35.148 --> 00:27:37.580\nNow the cool thing is right\nhere there's a step in.\n\n511\n00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:41.078\nWell then where is D10 coming from?\n\n512\n00:27:41.078 --> 00:27:46.449\nIf I put Step in, well D10 is really\nthe result of sum D5 through D8,\n\n513\n00:27:46.449 --> 00:27:48.370\nour February sales.\n\n514\n00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:48.950\nOkay, cool.\n\n515\n00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:49.503\nThanks.\n\n516\n00:27:49.503 --> 00:27:50.781\nLet me just step out.\n\n517\n00:27:50.781 --> 00:27:54.945\nAnd then,\nnotice it says that it evaluated $1000.\n\n518\n00:27:54.945 --> 00:27:58.344\nIs $1000 greater than K4?\n\n519\n00:27:58.344 --> 00:27:59.430\nWhere's K4?\n\n520\n00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:01.205\nWell, K4 says that it's $500.\n\n521\n00:28:01.205 --> 00:28:06.696\nSo you see the step in kind of gives\nyou what this underlying thing is.\n\n522\n00:28:06.696 --> 00:28:09.512\nAnd then if you step out,\nthen it's gonna go ahead and\n\n523\n00:28:09.512 --> 00:28:11.840\nit will start evaluating all those things.\n\n524\n00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.290\nSo you're saying, yes.\n\n525\n00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:16.096\nI can see $1000 is greater than 500.\n\n526\n00:28:16.096 --> 00:28:17.433\nSo let me go ahead and evaluate.\n\n527\n00:28:17.433 --> 00:28:18.275\nYes, it's true.\n\n528\n00:28:18.275 --> 00:28:20.081\nThen the next one, D10, okay?\n\n529\n00:28:20.081 --> 00:28:23.392\nWell, D10 is $1000.\n\n530\n00:28:23.392 --> 00:28:28.434\nK5, that's the 25%, so\nthey'll go ahead and evaluate that.\n\n531\n00:28:28.434 --> 00:28:29.912\nOkay, that's 250.\n\n532\n00:28:29.912 --> 00:28:34.962\nNow 250 plus D10 which is $1000,\n\n533\n00:28:34.962 --> 00:28:38.550\nthat means that it is $1250.\n\n534\n00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:41.301\nIt is true, so we get 1250.\n\n535\n00:28:41.301 --> 00:28:44.408\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n&gt;&gt; So it takes you through step by step of\n\n536\n00:28:44.408 --> 00:28:49.400\nthe formula to try and kind of break\nit down into those steps to show you\n\n537\n00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:54.826\nthe kind of computation that's happening,\nthe logic that's behind it,\n\n538\n00:28:54.826 --> 00:28:59.302\nand hopefully give you a little\nbit more of a guide to how this is\n\n539\n00:28:59.302 --> 00:29:03.469\nactually being determined,\nevaluating this formula.\n\n540\n00:29:03.469 --> 00:29:05.879\nHopefully, somewhat more in\nsome understandable terms,\n\n541\n00:29:05.879 --> 00:29:08.439\nsometimes you're like,\nI still don't know what that means.\n\n542\n00:29:08.439 --> 00:29:12.634\n[LAUGH] But at least it's giving you\na little bit of a leg up, and so\n\n543\n00:29:12.634 --> 00:29:17.784\nthose are the different things that you\ncan do to audit your formulas in Excel.\n\n544\n00:29:17.784 --> 00:29:22.373\nTry to give you a little more explanation\nas to how is this actually happening.\n\n545\n00:29:22.373 --> 00:29:25.355\nThis is simple,\nyou go into some complex ones,\n\n546\n00:29:25.355 --> 00:29:30.068\nyou might need a couple different gurus\n[LAUGH] to go ahead and explain them.\n\n547\n00:29:30.068 --> 00:29:33.727\nBut at least it gives you a starting\npoint, and see where you go.\n\n548\n00:29:33.727 --> 00:29:35.430\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne,\nyou're the only guru we need.\n\n549\n00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:37.520\nAnd thank you so very much.\n\n550\n00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:40.380\nFormula auditing, great episode,\nhope you enjoyed it.\n\n551\n00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:41.316\nI know I did.\n\n552\n00:29:41.316 --> 00:29:43.800\nAnd make sure you watch all of\nthe Excel functions episodes too,\n\n553\n00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.930\nbecause you'll be happy that you did.\n\n554\n00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:47.802\nAnd thank you for watching OfficeProTV.\n\n555\n00:29:47.802 --> 00:29:49.790\nRemember a good office\npro is always learning.\n\n556\n00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:50.640\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n557\n00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:51.488\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n558\n00:29:51.488 --> 00:29:53.099\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again very soon.\n\n",

OfficePro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:16.838\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison, and\n\n4\n00:00:16.838 --> 00:00:19.689\nin today's episode where we're\ncontinuing on with Excel functions.\n\n5\n00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.456\nSpecifically, we're gonna be\ntalking about the sum function.\n\n6\n00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:25.843\nI feel compelled because of the title.\n\n7\n00:00:25.843 --> 00:00:31.302\nBut luckily, we have our very own Excel\nmaestro in the studio with us today,\n\n8\n00:00:31.302 --> 00:00:32.678\nMs. Vonne Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:32.678 --> 00:00:33.708\nHow are you doing today, Vonne?\n\n10\n00:00:33.708 --> 00:00:34.570\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic.\n\n11\n00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.544\nYes, we are summing up all of our numbers.\n\n12\n00:00:37.544 --> 00:00:40.286\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] If I went ahead and did the way\n\n13\n00:00:40.286 --> 00:00:44.359\nthat pretty much almost everything you\nread about in Excel function today.\n\n14\n00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:48.304\nGo ahead and capitalize the name of\nthe functions, well, because that's how it\n\n15\n00:00:48.304 --> 00:00:52.148\ngoes in the actual function dialog box,\nand how it actually shows up in Excel.\n\n16\n00:00:52.148 --> 00:00:55.993\nSo I decided to stay with convention,\nand go ahead and capitalize it.\n\n17\n00:00:55.993 --> 00:00:58.846\nAnd yes, you see all caps and you feel\nlike you have to talk really loud, right?\n\n18\n00:00:58.846 --> 00:01:01.521\nYes, so that's good for you to set.\n\n19\n00:01:01.521 --> 00:01:02.587\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n20\n00:01:02.587 --> 00:01:05.672\nthat's one of those things that\nfrom an email etiquette type thing,\n\n21\n00:01:05.672 --> 00:01:08.395\nif you're typing in all caps,\nthat means you're yelling.\n\n22\n00:01:08.395 --> 00:01:09.850\nBut, a lot of times these functions are.\n\n23\n00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.838\nI like to think of them as\nkind of like programming.\n\n24\n00:01:12.838 --> 00:01:18.326\nSo it's how they're naming the routines,\nyou should use similar naming conventions.\n\n25\n00:01:18.326 --> 00:01:21.061\nEven if they do work,\nyou should still try to abide by those,\n\n26\n00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:24.884\ncuz in future updates may change, hey,\nif it's not capitalized, doesn't work.\n\n27\n00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:27.637\nI'm pretty sure things are broken\nif you don't capitalize.\n\n28\n00:01:27.637 --> 00:01:30.117\nI use autocomplete a lot, so\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n29\n00:01:30.117 --> 00:01:33.698\n&gt;&gt; I have a hard time\n&gt;&gt; Speaking to that, but what is,\n\n30\n00:01:33.698 --> 00:01:37.125\nI mean,\nis the sum exactly what it sounds like.\n\n31\n00:01:37.125 --> 00:01:40.662\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] and that's where you,\nwell we have an entire episode on\n\n32\n00:01:40.662 --> 00:01:44.940\njust the sum function, and when you think\nof sum, you're just adding up numbers.\n\n33\n00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.285\nWe're saying, I would like to take this\nplus this, and tell me what the result is.\n\n34\n00:01:49.285 --> 00:01:53.301\nAnd we did do a little bit of these\ndifferent things in the basic functions,\n\n35\n00:01:53.301 --> 00:01:57.028\nwhere we we're just describing what\nis a function, how do we use it.\n\n36\n00:01:57.028 --> 00:02:01.002\nSo some of it might seem a little\nredundant, if you've watched that episode.\n\n37\n00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:02.939\nBut, this is the function library, so\n\n38\n00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.186\nwe're just going through all\nthe different functions in Excel.\n\n39\n00:02:06.186 --> 00:02:07.965\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\ngive you examples.\n\n40\n00:02:07.965 --> 00:02:10.991\nAnd so that's why there might\nbe a little bit of redundancy.\n\n41\n00:02:10.991 --> 00:02:12.579\nDone on purpose for you.\n\n42\n00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:15.534\nSo, why don't we go ahead and get started.\n\n43\n00:02:15.534 --> 00:02:20.701\nI have a file called, some.xlsx,\nand we've got some information on\n\n44\n00:02:20.701 --> 00:02:25.971\nhere to where we have some stores for\nour Christmas cats incorporated.\n\n45\n00:02:25.971 --> 00:02:30.801\nWe're still going on with the cats,\nso we see Gainesville, Jacksonville,\n\n46\n00:02:30.801 --> 00:02:33.417\nOrlando, and I want to make some totals.\n\n47\n00:02:33.417 --> 00:02:35.885\nI wanna see how many bouncy balls we sell.\n\n48\n00:02:35.885 --> 00:02:39.756\nHow many total toys that we sell in\nGainesville, and then I have some other\n\n49\n00:02:39.756 --> 00:02:43.451\nones over here, so we could start\ngoing through some different ones.\n\n50\n00:02:43.451 --> 00:02:46.437\nAnd I have a couple of different\nworksheets that we're going to go\n\n51\n00:02:46.437 --> 00:02:49.860\n[INAUDIBLE] to give you some more samples\nAlso throwing out some short cuts,\n\n52\n00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.132\nyou know I love a short cut.\n\n53\n00:02:51.132 --> 00:02:52.556\nSo we're gonna go through everything.\n\n54\n00:02:52.556 --> 00:02:59.206\nSo,, let's talk about, first of all, let's\ntotal up our Gainesville store total.\n\n55\n00:02:59.206 --> 00:03:03.334\nI wanna see how many total toys\ndid we sell in Gainesville.\n\n56\n00:03:03.334 --> 00:03:06.150\nSo, just like we always know,\nwe need to go ahead and\n\n57\n00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.109\nput our cursor into where we\nwant the answer to go into.\n\n58\n00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:14.470\nThis is where I want my formula or\nfunction to be able to be inserted.\n\n59\n00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.282\nSo then,\nwe go over to our formulas tab, and\n\n60\n00:03:17.282 --> 00:03:22.009\nthe sum function is part of the Math and\nTrigonometry group of functions.\n\n61\n00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:26.190\nAs we scroll on down through here,\nthis is where, this is one of the ways\n\n62\n00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.632\nthat we can go ahead and\nfind where the sum function lives.\n\n63\n00:03:29.632 --> 00:03:34.261\nAnd when we click on this, it's going to\nopen up the answer function dialog box to\n\n64\n00:03:34.261 --> 00:03:38.981\nwhere it says, all right, we'll now go\nahead and give me the function argument.\n\n65\n00:03:38.981 --> 00:03:41.712\nAnd, it gives us little tips and\ntricks along the way.\n\n66\n00:03:41.712 --> 00:03:45.246\nIt's where we're going to add\na just one range of numbers.\n\n67\n00:03:45.246 --> 00:03:48.705\nSo we only need number one, and\nthen, it's gonna say, go ahead and\n\n68\n00:03:48.705 --> 00:03:50.539\nadd up all the numbers in the range.\n\n69\n00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:53.513\nLet's go ahead and\nget rid of whatever it's in there, and\n\n70\n00:03:53.513 --> 00:03:56.198\nwe're going to make sure\nour cursor is in the field.\n\n71\n00:03:56.198 --> 00:04:01.336\nWe come out over into our worksheet,\nand we select with our white plus sign,\n\n72\n00:04:01.336 --> 00:04:05.938\nB4 through B9, because those\nare all of the toys in Gainesville.\n\n73\n00:04:05.938 --> 00:04:08.996\nYou can always see the results of your\nformulas kind of hanging out down here,\n\n74\n00:04:08.996 --> 00:04:10.794\nand say like, yep, that looks about right.\n\n75\n00:04:10.794 --> 00:04:13.190\nAnd we click OK, and there you go.\n\n76\n00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.470\nThat's what we've got\nwith our sum function.\n\n77\n00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.170\nAnd then, you can see up in the formula\nbar in here, that's it's going to go ahead\n\n78\n00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.620\nand start with our equal sign, cuz\nthat's where it always starts off with.\n\n79\n00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.155\nWe have the sum and\nthen the range of B4 through 9.\n\n80\n00:04:26.155 --> 00:04:28.214\nWe know that the range is with the colon.\n\n81\n00:04:28.214 --> 00:04:33.442\nSo that is the easiest way, or one of\nthe easiest ways that you can go ahead and\n\n82\n00:04:33.442 --> 00:04:37.144\nuse the sum function [LAUGH],\nthat's what I just did.\n\n83\n00:04:37.144 --> 00:04:39.326\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sum function [LAUGH]\n\n84\n00:04:39.326 --> 00:04:40.659\n&gt;&gt; Functions are fun,\n\n85\n00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:42.545\nit's actually in the name.\n\n86\n00:04:42.545 --> 00:04:46.803\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] exactly, so, a little\nbit of a flipping around on there.\n\n87\n00:04:46.803 --> 00:04:50.682\nSo why don't we go ahead and\nnow do two ranges.\n\n88\n00:04:50.682 --> 00:04:53.489\nLet's do the Gainesville and\nOrlando stores only.\n\n89\n00:04:53.489 --> 00:04:57.012\nSo let's go ahead and\nput our cursor here in D16, and\n\n90\n00:04:57.012 --> 00:05:00.318\nI want to total up all the Gainesville and\nOrlando.\n\n91\n00:05:00.318 --> 00:05:04.074\nSo let's use the insert function\ndialogue box this time.\n\n92\n00:05:04.074 --> 00:05:06.094\nYou could either click\nthe little button right here.\n\n93\n00:05:06.094 --> 00:05:10.708\nOr you can go ahead and click it on the\ninsert function button up on the left hand\n\n94\n00:05:10.708 --> 00:05:12.416\nside of the formula's tab.\n\n95\n00:05:12.416 --> 00:05:16.761\nSo many different ways to get to the same\nplace, so we'll go with the small button,\n\n96\n00:05:16.761 --> 00:05:17.642\nwe'll go here.\n\n97\n00:05:17.642 --> 00:05:21.235\nSo this is where we need to go ahead and\nfind the sum function.\n\n98\n00:05:21.235 --> 00:05:25.270\nWe know that it is in our Math and\nTrigonometry category, or\n\n99\n00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.568\nI can also, I know I've been using\nthis for a lot of times here.\n\n100\n00:05:29.568 --> 00:05:33.149\nSo I'm gonna go to the most recently used,\nand then it will be there.\n\n101\n00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:36.158\nAnd you know if we need to\nwe could always go ahead and\n\n102\n00:05:36.158 --> 00:05:39.037\ndo our search in the top\nto find the sum function.\n\n103\n00:05:39.037 --> 00:05:43.720\nWe'll click OK, and now we want to go\nahead and total up two different ranges.\n\n104\n00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.026\nSo using the insert function dialog box,\nit makes it a little easier for us.\n\n105\n00:05:47.026 --> 00:05:51.802\nTo go ahead and say, let's go ahead and\nput the one, the first number range,\n\n106\n00:05:51.802 --> 00:05:55.567\nwhich is going to be from here,\nall of our Gainesville toys.\n\n107\n00:05:55.567 --> 00:05:58.890\nAnd then we're gonna put our cursor\nin the second number, and it's\n\n108\n00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:02.877\ngoing to go ahead and kinda divide it all\nup for us, and it's kinda nice that way.\n\n109\n00:06:02.877 --> 00:06:09.437\nSo we'll click our cursor there, select\nthe cells in Orlando, and there we go.\n\n110\n00:06:09.437 --> 00:06:16.084\nWe could see that, that result is we've\ndone 736 toys in those different stores.\n\n111\n00:06:16.084 --> 00:06:21.288\nSo, using the different ranges,\nnotice up here in the syntax that it\n\n112\n00:06:21.288 --> 00:06:27.146\nis going to say the first range here,\ncomma, and then the second range here.\n\n113\n00:06:27.146 --> 00:06:31.355\nAnd of course, if you always click\ninto the formula, you can go ahead and\n\n114\n00:06:31.355 --> 00:06:35.305\nsee the highlighting of the different\nnumbers that it's pulling.\n\n115\n00:06:35.305 --> 00:06:39.306\nAnd so that way we could go ahead, and see\nthe syntax of that particular function.\n\n116\n00:06:39.306 --> 00:06:43.211\nI just hit the escape key right now\nto go ahead and get out of that.\n\n117\n00:06:43.211 --> 00:06:44.531\nSo up until this point,\n\n118\n00:06:44.531 --> 00:06:48.561\npretty much been almost all of a review\nfrom our basic function episode.\n\n119\n00:06:48.561 --> 00:06:52.523\nBut, it's nice to be able to go\nahead re-emphasize all these, and\n\n120\n00:06:52.523 --> 00:06:56.638\ndo all the basics for your sum before\nwe move on to some other examples.\n\n121\n00:06:56.638 --> 00:06:59.499\n&gt;&gt; Now, speaking of basics,\nthose of you watching, you're like,\n\n122\n00:06:59.499 --> 00:07:00.939\nJustin wasn't in that episode.\n\n123\n00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:03.886\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I may be asking a question that was\n\n124\n00:07:03.886 --> 00:07:07.254\nalready talked about, but\njust to further emphasize.\n\n125\n00:07:07.254 --> 00:07:10.363\nWhen I had a number three with those\nbrackets and then comma dot, dot,\n\n126\n00:07:10.363 --> 00:07:12.854\ndot That means that I'm not\njust limited to two ranges.\n\n127\n00:07:12.854 --> 00:07:19.933\nI essentially can have unlimited ranges,\nfinite, unlimited, right?\n\n128\n00:07:19.933 --> 00:07:24.342\nSome finite number that is more than two,\nin order to get a sum over multiple\n\n129\n00:07:24.342 --> 00:07:27.571\nkind of partitions about the spreadsheet,\ncorrect?\n\n130\n00:07:27.571 --> 00:07:31.357\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and that is a nice thing\nabout using that insert function.\n\n131\n00:07:31.357 --> 00:07:34.461\nIs if I'm going ahead and say,\nhere's number one and number two,\n\n132\n00:07:34.461 --> 00:07:37.185\nI can then just go number three,\nit could be a single cell.\n\n133\n00:07:37.185 --> 00:07:39.735\nAnd then, number four could be two cells.\n\n134\n00:07:39.735 --> 00:07:42.372\nI mean, so you could go ahead and add,\n\n135\n00:07:42.372 --> 00:07:46.589\nI'm sure that there's some limiters,\nyou know, 255.\n\n136\n00:07:46.589 --> 00:07:48.137\nI'm just throwing out a number,\n\n137\n00:07:48.137 --> 00:07:51.078\nI've no idea of how many one's\nthat you could go ahead and use.\n\n138\n00:07:51.078 --> 00:07:53.668\nBut yes, you can go ahead and\nkeep on going,\n\n139\n00:07:53.668 --> 00:07:58.079\ncuz it's really more of like I wanna Add\nup this and this and this and this and\n\n140\n00:07:58.079 --> 00:08:00.694\nthis and\nyou can keep on going which is nice.\n\n141\n00:08:00.694 --> 00:08:04.161\nI can go ahead and keep clicked then but\nI'm not populating them so\n\n142\n00:08:04.161 --> 00:08:07.768\nits not changing anything it's not\ngoing to add like extra commas.\n\n143\n00:08:07.768 --> 00:08:11.527\nIt's just used there to kind of\nhelp you log in that's why I do\n\n144\n00:08:11.527 --> 00:08:14.859\nthat insert function dialogue box so\ngood question.\n\n145\n00:08:14.859 --> 00:08:17.945\nNow we're going to move\non to using the autosum.\n\n146\n00:08:17.945 --> 00:08:22.916\nNow I love the autosum and\nespecially if your data is set up\n\n147\n00:08:22.916 --> 00:08:27.483\nthe right way for\nit to be used the most efficiently.\n\n148\n00:08:27.483 --> 00:08:31.753\nFor example, if I have the bouncy balls,\nI want to go ahead and\n\n149\n00:08:31.753 --> 00:08:36.600\ntotal up how many bouncy balls that\nI have across all three stores now,\n\n150\n00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:41.881\nthe location of where I want the answer\nto go is right next to all the numbers.\n\n151\n00:08:41.881 --> 00:08:45.426\nSo, this is the situation we're\nusing autosum is gonna be really\n\n152\n00:08:45.426 --> 00:08:46.525\nlike snappy quick.\n\n153\n00:08:46.525 --> 00:08:49.909\nSo, put your cursor after\nthere you click the autosum,\n\n154\n00:08:49.909 --> 00:08:54.806\nbecause it automatically goes ahead and\nputs in the sum function, goes ahead and\n\n155\n00:08:54.806 --> 00:08:59.072\npops up with the equals,\nthe function name, and then the arguments.\n\n156\n00:08:59.072 --> 00:09:03.442\nAnd then it's gonna go out and\ngrab whatever it sees closest to\n\n157\n00:09:03.442 --> 00:09:07.825\nwhere you're at and\nin this case that's exactly what I need.\n\n158\n00:09:07.825 --> 00:09:12.805\nSo it's like with one single click\nof a button I could go ahead and\n\n159\n00:09:12.805 --> 00:09:18.628\ncreate all of my adding or my rows or\nfor the information I want right there.\n\n160\n00:09:18.628 --> 00:09:21.952\nSo boom super quick, love it,\nit's pretty awesome.\n\n161\n00:09:21.952 --> 00:09:26.393\nNow I still go ahead and\nuse the autosum when I have the result of\n\n162\n00:09:26.393 --> 00:09:29.565\nthe formula that is not\nnext to the numbers.\n\n163\n00:09:29.565 --> 00:09:34.323\nFor example if I wanted to total up\nthe Jacksonville stores go ahead and\n\n164\n00:09:34.323 --> 00:09:37.723\nclick here on the bottom\nwhere my store totals go.\n\n165\n00:09:37.723 --> 00:09:40.224\nI go the the autosum and\nit is smart enough to say\n\n166\n00:09:40.224 --> 00:09:43.896\nwell the numbers are on top of you so\nI'm going to go ahead and pull that.\n\n167\n00:09:43.896 --> 00:09:48.166\nNow I could go ahead and say yes that's\ngreat, but I don't want to include these\n\n168\n00:09:48.166 --> 00:09:51.439\nblank rows in here because what\nif I did put a number in there?\n\n169\n00:09:51.439 --> 00:09:52.746\nI don't want to throw it off.\n\n170\n00:09:52.746 --> 00:09:57.417\nSo It is good to make sure with the white\nplus sign, you go back out and select\n\n171\n00:09:57.417 --> 00:10:02.309\nthe numbers that you want to go ahead and\ntotal up and then you hit enter to accept\n\n172\n00:10:02.309 --> 00:10:07.230\nor you can also hit the little plus sign,\nsorry, the check mark right here.\n\n173\n00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:11.367\nIt's like to say, yep I'm done I just\nlike to hit enter and then move on.\n\n174\n00:10:11.367 --> 00:10:15.927\nAnd just to tell about the autosum\nwith your multiple ranges,\n\n175\n00:10:15.927 --> 00:10:21.363\nas long as you use your Ctrl key you can\ngo ahead and keep selecting multiple\n\n176\n00:10:21.363 --> 00:10:26.373\nranges and-or cells, and\nit will go ahead and populate it for you.\n\n177\n00:10:26.373 --> 00:10:30.313\nSo let's do the Gainesville and\nOrlando stores again.\n\n178\n00:10:30.313 --> 00:10:35.693\nWe'll go over to our autosum, I get\nmy first range hold that control key.\n\n179\n00:10:35.693 --> 00:10:38.168\nThen go ahead and select my second and\n\n180\n00:10:38.168 --> 00:10:41.554\nas long as you keep the control\nkey held down you can go ahead and\n\n181\n00:10:41.554 --> 00:10:45.942\nkeep going to do that so, again, do you\nlike the insert function dialogue box?\n\n182\n00:10:45.942 --> 00:10:47.909\nDo you like the autosum?\n\n183\n00:10:47.909 --> 00:10:51.801\nTo each his own and whichever way\nmakes you feel more comfortable.\n\n184\n00:10:51.801 --> 00:10:56.850\nAnd I want you're kinda used to doing\nit a little more, you might actually\n\n185\n00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:01.589\ngo on to the next way of doing it,\nis to where you actually type it out.\n\n186\n00:11:01.589 --> 00:11:06.577\nCuz sometimes no matter how much help\nthe Insert Function dialog box gives you,\n\n187\n00:11:06.577 --> 00:11:10.448\nyou're gonna have to manually\ntype out parts of the formula,\n\n188\n00:11:10.448 --> 00:11:13.740\nwhich will be some more\nexamples a little bit later.\n\n189\n00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:18.451\nSo let's go ahead and start with the sum\nof where I want the answer to go to.\n\n190\n00:11:18.451 --> 00:11:23.660\nWe always start out with our equals sign\nand then we go ahead and type in the name\n\n191\n00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:28.549\nof the function and as soon as you start\ntyping it's going to give you that\n\n192\n00:11:28.549 --> 00:11:33.873\nhelper drop down that's going to help\npopulate your functions along the way.\n\n193\n00:11:33.873 --> 00:11:38.110\nSo if I use that, that's what I want,\nI want the sum function.\n\n194\n00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:42.660\nThen I can go ahead and use my open\nparenthesis to get my arguments.\n\n195\n00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:48.391\nAnd then, I want to then take my mouse I\ncould physically type in D4 through D9,\n\n196\n00:11:48.391 --> 00:11:52.604\nbut why don't you go ahead and\nkind of mix it up a little bit,\n\n197\n00:11:52.604 --> 00:11:57.103\nuse your cursor as flashing and\nwhere it's going to populate.\n\n198\n00:11:57.103 --> 00:12:01.173\nGo ahead and select yourselves\nwith your mouse say yep I'm good,\n\n199\n00:12:01.173 --> 00:12:05.471\nclose the parentheses, hit enter and\nthen it goes ahead and does it.\n\n200\n00:12:05.471 --> 00:12:09.406\nSo a whole bunch of different\nways that we can go ahead and\n\n201\n00:12:09.406 --> 00:12:14.454\nget the answers to our formulas where\nwe want them to go so, there we go.\n\n202\n00:12:14.454 --> 00:12:18.587\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne, I said something earlier in\nthe episode about case sensitivity and\n\n203\n00:12:18.587 --> 00:12:23.347\nuppercase letters, I'm interested cuz you\njust typed all lowercase there, it worked,\n\n204\n00:12:23.347 --> 00:12:25.054\nbut does it stay all lowercase.\n\n205\n00:12:25.054 --> 00:12:29.235\nLooks like it might be a little helpful\nfor you because well, the uppercase is\n\n206\n00:12:29.235 --> 00:12:33.759\nthe actual function name and it just\nassumed, this is probably what they meant.\n\n207\n00:12:33.759 --> 00:12:37.486\nSo there is some transformation behind the\nscenes that occurs just to be helpful to\n\n208\n00:12:37.486 --> 00:12:39.818\nyou so\nyou don't have to remember caps locks.\n\n209\n00:12:39.818 --> 00:12:41.888\n&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly,\ncuz I it's good that you pointed that out,\n\n210\n00:12:41.888 --> 00:12:43.417\nbecause I was just typing out the letters.\n\n211\n00:12:43.417 --> 00:12:47.236\nThis is gonna go ahead here because\nall function names are going to\n\n212\n00:12:47.236 --> 00:12:50.993\ngo in capital letters that's\na good way to know the difference.\n\n213\n00:12:50.993 --> 00:12:56.419\nGood, let's go over to another\nexample that I want to show\n\n214\n00:12:56.419 --> 00:13:03.857\nusing the regular operators of this cell\nplus this cell, versus using the sum.\n\n215\n00:13:03.857 --> 00:13:07.648\n&gt;&gt; And really kinda comes down\nto how it handles errors.\n\n216\n00:13:07.648 --> 00:13:12.651\nOver here you see I've got the bouncy\nballs and crinkle balls for Gainesville,\n\n217\n00:13:12.651 --> 00:13:17.516\nso I really just wanna go ahead and add\nthis bouncy ball and this crinkle ball.\n\n218\n00:13:17.516 --> 00:13:21.597\nI could go ahead and use the plus sign,\nlet's go over this one,\n\n219\n00:13:21.597 --> 00:13:26.141\nwe can go ahead and say equals and\nthen this particular cell will go with\n\n220\n00:13:26.141 --> 00:13:31.093\nthe crinkle ball first Then I use plus\nthe bouncy balls so, that looks good.\n\n221\n00:13:31.093 --> 00:13:35.085\nClick OK 164, totally fine.\n\n222\n00:13:35.085 --> 00:13:39.179\nWhat if I went over here and\ndid the, let's go with the autosum.\n\n223\n00:13:39.179 --> 00:13:42.029\nAnd then notice it's not\npulling the right numbers.\n\n224\n00:13:42.029 --> 00:13:44.361\nSo sometimes the autosum\nisn't always accurate and\n\n225\n00:13:44.361 --> 00:13:47.709\nthat's okay because I'm going back out and\ngoing to select my arguments.\n\n226\n00:13:47.709 --> 00:13:52.133\nI want this one hold my control key,\nand this one, okay.\n\n227\n00:13:52.133 --> 00:13:56.838\nThis way I went the bouncy ball first so,\neither way, same thing so I go ahead and\n\n228\n00:13:56.838 --> 00:13:59.589\nclick enter everything\nlooks the exact same.\n\n229\n00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:03.958\nAnd if I had changed this number from 1,\nfrom 96 to 196,\n\n230\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:07.247\nyou can see it's going\nto change the results.\n\n231\n00:14:07.247 --> 00:14:11.797\nBut for what if I went ahead and\ndid like NA like Not Available.\n\n232\n00:14:11.797 --> 00:14:16.147\nLike for some reason, like, we didn't\nhave any crinkle balls in Gainesville for\n\n233\n00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:18.239\nthis particular session or whatever.\n\n234\n00:14:18.239 --> 00:14:24.368\nAnd I take this, well, here it changes\nto 68 here it's giving me an error.\n\n235\n00:14:24.368 --> 00:14:28.762\nIt's saying, Hey, there's a value problem,\n\n236\n00:14:28.762 --> 00:14:32.525\nI can't, you cannot add number to text.\n\n237\n00:14:32.525 --> 00:14:37.302\nIt just breaks all mathematical\ntheories or what have you.\n\n238\n00:14:37.302 --> 00:14:40.943\nI know you're a mathematical person but,\nI'm pretty sure that's the way it goes\n\n239\n00:14:40.943 --> 00:14:43.554\nwell at least in this situation\nit's going to be that way.\n\n240\n00:14:43.554 --> 00:14:49.214\nSo, you can't add a number and a text and\nso that's why you get a value error here.\n\n241\n00:14:49.214 --> 00:14:53.488\nBut if I'm using the sum function,\nnotice it's just gonna go ahead and\n\n242\n00:14:53.488 --> 00:14:56.493\ntreat N/A as just nothing,\nit's gonna be zero.\n\n243\n00:14:56.493 --> 00:15:01.618\nSo it's really just 86\nplus zero which is 68.\n\n244\n00:15:01.618 --> 00:15:06.494\nSo, that might be some, I just want to\nkinda emphasize of why you might want to\n\n245\n00:15:06.494 --> 00:15:11.594\nuse the sum function, even if you're only\nadding up two numbers, or two cells,\n\n246\n00:15:11.594 --> 00:15:16.492\nit might just go ahead and avoid some\nerrors that you might come down the line.\n\n247\n00:15:16.492 --> 00:15:21.436\nSo, we've got that let's talk about\nhow we can Copy our functions\n\n248\n00:15:21.436 --> 00:15:25.851\nbecause right here our store\ntotals are toy totals, whew,\n\n249\n00:15:25.851 --> 00:15:31.255\nthat was a hard one to get out I want to\nbe able to pull this all the way down.\n\n250\n00:15:31.255 --> 00:15:36.132\nWhen I say pull down, it means I'm going\nto use the fill handle to copy this\n\n251\n00:15:36.132 --> 00:15:38.818\ndown and using the relative reference.\n\n252\n00:15:38.818 --> 00:15:42.031\nSo, if I click, hold, and drag down,\nyou can see that, there we go.\n\n253\n00:15:42.031 --> 00:15:45.867\nWe went ahead and got all of our\ntoy totals for the spirals and\n\n254\n00:15:45.867 --> 00:15:48.880\nthe jumping frogs,\nby taking the first cell.\n\n255\n00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.063\nTaking that function, copying it down, and\n\n256\n00:15:52.063 --> 00:15:56.921\nthen using that relative reference,\nit knows that you went down, so\n\n257\n00:15:56.921 --> 00:16:01.381\nthe references go down and\nthen another down and down and down.\n\n258\n00:16:01.381 --> 00:16:05.382\nAnd so that's where doing one of them and\nthen copying across or\n\n259\n00:16:05.382 --> 00:16:08.707\ndown depending on which\nway you're going is super,\n\n260\n00:16:08.707 --> 00:16:12.182\nsuper helpful because of\nthat relative reference, so\n\n261\n00:16:12.182 --> 00:16:16.739\nI really like to show you guys how to\ndo that or this particular example.\n\n262\n00:16:16.739 --> 00:16:22.774\nNow we're gonna move on to another example\nthat I could go through very easily and\n\n263\n00:16:22.774 --> 00:16:26.875\nsay, all right,\nwell let's do the Toy Totals [LAUGH].\n\n264\n00:16:26.875 --> 00:16:31.506\nWe'll go with the AutoSum,\ngrab all of them, hit Enter, grab this,\n\n265\n00:16:31.506 --> 00:16:35.130\npull it down, that's great,\ndo the same thing here.\n\n266\n00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:37.309\nWe can go ahead and do the AutoSum.\n\n267\n00:16:37.309 --> 00:16:41.382\nYep, I want to total that up, grab that,\nblack bus it all the way over, and\n\n268\n00:16:41.382 --> 00:16:44.063\nthen we can go ahead and\nget something like that.\n\n269\n00:16:44.063 --> 00:16:45.571\nThat was done pretty quickly, right?\n\n270\n00:16:45.571 --> 00:16:48.950\nThere's even a faster way to do it.\n\n271\n00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:52.137\nIt all depends on how\neverything is set up.\n\n272\n00:16:52.137 --> 00:16:58.759\nIf everything is set up nicely like this,\nyou can do all this in one step.\n\n273\n00:16:58.759 --> 00:17:00.340\nIt's pretty awesome.\n\n274\n00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:02.893\nWatch, if I select all of this,\nall right, so\n\n275\n00:17:02.893 --> 00:17:06.431\nnow I'm even grabbing all the text,\nthe labels, everything,\n\n276\n00:17:06.431 --> 00:17:10.907\nbecause it's going to differentiate\nthe difference between text and numbers.\n\n277\n00:17:10.907 --> 00:17:16.839\nAnd so get them all there, just hit\nthe AutoSum button, and then poof done.\n\n278\n00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:18.400\n[LAUGH] Right?\n\n279\n00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:22.561\n&gt;&gt; Well, I will tell you Vonne, I can't\ntell you how long I've spent to get\n\n280\n00:17:22.561 --> 00:17:26.794\nrelative column totals and row totals\nbecause then at the lower right hand\n\n281\n00:17:26.794 --> 00:17:29.472\ncorners you essentially\nhave Overall total.\n\n282\n00:17:29.472 --> 00:17:34.263\nI can't tell you how long I have spent all\nright, I gotta get these over here, and\n\n283\n00:17:34.263 --> 00:17:37.521\ndidn't know that would work,\nso I am kind of excited.\n\n284\n00:17:37.521 --> 00:17:42.338\nThat just made me more efficient in\nmy Excel adventures when I do dive\n\n285\n00:17:42.338 --> 00:17:43.274\ninto Excel.\n\n286\n00:17:43.274 --> 00:17:48.011\n&gt;&gt; Nice, yeah, well, I like that too and\nof course, it's every single spreadsheet\n\n287\n00:17:48.011 --> 00:17:52.361\nthat you are going to set up this way,\nnot always, but if it is, it's nice.\n\n288\n00:17:52.361 --> 00:17:55.146\nAnd just to show you\neven more of a shortcut.\n\n289\n00:17:55.146 --> 00:17:58.389\nYes, the clicking\nthe button is totally fine,\n\n290\n00:17:58.389 --> 00:18:03.913\nthere's nothing wrong with that, but\nthe keyboard shortcut for this is Alt =.\n\n291\n00:18:03.913 --> 00:18:06.764\nSo I just held down on the Alt key and\nthen =, which is weird cuz you usually\n\n292\n00:18:06.764 --> 00:18:08.849\nhold the Ctrl or\nsomething like that, but the Alt =.\n\n293\n00:18:08.849 --> 00:18:11.568\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Vonne, I'm gonna be honest with you,\n\n294\n00:18:11.568 --> 00:18:12.374\nyou just blew my mind.\n\n295\n00:18:12.374 --> 00:18:17.145\nI'm not sure I can continue this\nshow because I'm big on not\n\n296\n00:18:17.145 --> 00:18:20.018\nmoving my hands from the keyboard.\n\n297\n00:18:20.018 --> 00:18:24.227\nSo if I can select and Alt =, and\nboom AutoSum, and then it gets me.\n\n298\n00:18:24.227 --> 00:18:26.367\nThat is a work of art.\n\n299\n00:18:26.367 --> 00:18:30.706\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, I'm so glad that I could\nteach you something really quick cuz I'm\n\n300\n00:18:30.706 --> 00:18:32.172\nall about shortcuts too.\n\n301\n00:18:32.172 --> 00:18:35.350\nSo yeah, if you want quick totals,\nthere you go.\n\n302\n00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:39.166\nSelect Alt =, bada bing, bada boom.\n\n303\n00:18:39.166 --> 00:18:43.579\nSo let's move over to some other\nexamples for summing that.\n\n304\n00:18:43.579 --> 00:18:47.916\nNow, if you have things in a table,\nnow this is formatted as a table.\n\n305\n00:18:47.916 --> 00:18:50.709\nI went over to the Home tab,\nI went ahead and formatted it,\n\n306\n00:18:50.709 --> 00:18:54.243\nI've got my Table Tools Contextual tab,\nso it's already got that here.\n\n307\n00:18:54.243 --> 00:18:58.036\nIf I wanted to have this\npopulate with the sum,\n\n308\n00:18:58.036 --> 00:19:02.818\nthe cool thing is already formatted,\nit already does it.\n\n309\n00:19:02.818 --> 00:19:06.139\nIf you're like I just I just kinda did a\ncouple loops, let me just show you, okay.\n\n310\n00:19:06.139 --> 00:19:10.395\nSo right here, if I put my cursor\nwhere I want the answer to go into,\n\n311\n00:19:10.395 --> 00:19:13.448\nI go over to the formulas and\nI go to the AutoSum.\n\n312\n00:19:13.448 --> 00:19:15.129\nIt's also on the Home tab by the way.\n\n313\n00:19:15.129 --> 00:19:17.368\nOn the Home,\nthere is the AutoSum right there.\n\n314\n00:19:17.368 --> 00:19:20.124\nSo if I click it,\nnotice it will go ahead and\n\n315\n00:19:20.124 --> 00:19:24.878\npull out the references just like we\nhad before, but do take notice that it\n\n316\n00:19:24.878 --> 00:19:28.958\ndoes some weird syntaxing because\nit's formatted as a table.\n\n317\n00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:31.071\nSo you see it's taking the table name,\n\n318\n00:19:31.071 --> 00:19:34.913\nwhich is table one cuz I didn't name\nit and then it's saying all right,\n\n319\n00:19:34.913 --> 00:19:39.293\nwe're going to go through cuz you can see\nthe colon cuz you know that's through.\n\n320\n00:19:39.293 --> 00:19:42.617\nAnd we have January and March,\nthat looks like the column headings.\n\n321\n00:19:42.617 --> 00:19:47.033\nAnd these brackets that are these square\nbraces that are going on and everything,\n\n322\n00:19:47.033 --> 00:19:50.304\nit's really kinda going through\nwhat's known as an array.\n\n323\n00:19:50.304 --> 00:19:51.514\nYou don't have to worry about it.\n\n324\n00:19:51.514 --> 00:19:53.195\nYou're with me here.\n\n325\n00:19:53.195 --> 00:19:54.767\nWe're gonna do the Justin hand wave.\n\n326\n00:19:54.767 --> 00:19:57.962\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's okay, don't worry about that.\n\n327\n00:19:57.962 --> 00:20:02.221\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like to think of those as just\nnamed fields instead of using the Excel\n\n328\n00:20:02.221 --> 00:20:02.897\nlabeling.\n\n329\n00:20:02.897 --> 00:20:04.027\nSo within tables,\n\n330\n00:20:04.027 --> 00:20:08.417\nthose are just named fields that should\nmake sense to you just at a glance.\n\n331\n00:20:08.417 --> 00:20:11.611\nYou don't have to know the intricacies\nof the new ones, details about it, so\n\n332\n00:20:11.611 --> 00:20:12.511\nnothing to see here.\n\n333\n00:20:12.511 --> 00:20:13.686\nIt still works.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n334\n00:20:13.686 --> 00:20:16.203\n[LAUGH] And then all we gotta\ndo now is just hit Enter and\n\n335\n00:20:16.203 --> 00:20:17.806\ntwo things are gonna happen.\n\n336\n00:20:17.806 --> 00:20:19.609\nIt's gonna do the Fuego.\n\n337\n00:20:19.609 --> 00:20:23.561\nIt's also just gonna go ahead and\nautomatically do all the other ones, and\n\n338\n00:20:23.561 --> 00:20:25.584\nthat's again because it's a table.\n\n339\n00:20:25.584 --> 00:20:29.859\nIf it wasn't a table, it wouldn't do\nthat automatically, so I like that.\n\n340\n00:20:29.859 --> 00:20:34.226\nI love formatting everything as tables,\nso that's a little trick there for you.\n\n341\n00:20:34.226 --> 00:20:36.995\nAnd just notice the references and\neverything will be fine.\n\n342\n00:20:36.995 --> 00:20:40.936\nNotice it doesn't change\nhere because we don't have\n\n343\n00:20:40.936 --> 00:20:45.238\nlike the relative reference in\nthe sense of the rows here.\n\n344\n00:20:45.238 --> 00:20:48.703\nIt doesn't see that,\nall it sees is okay, this is the field.\n\n345\n00:20:48.703 --> 00:20:50.478\nWe're in the same place,\nso we're all good.\n\n346\n00:20:50.478 --> 00:20:53.181\nSo again, we're all fine there.\n\n347\n00:20:53.181 --> 00:20:58.074\nAll right, so let's move onto the last\none that I wanted to show you with\n\n348\n00:20:58.074 --> 00:21:03.313\ndoing some different examples of how\nyou can use this sum function, right.\n\n349\n00:21:03.313 --> 00:21:06.381\nYou're like wow, I didn't know there was\nthis this many options between sums.\n\n350\n00:21:06.381 --> 00:21:10.270\nSo the running totals, now this is\nsomething we see in our bank accounts and\n\n351\n00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.422\neverything like that where it's\nlike here's the number and\n\n352\n00:21:13.422 --> 00:21:16.817\nthen if we have a deposit or\na withdrawal, either a plus or minus,\n\n353\n00:21:16.817 --> 00:21:20.195\nthen it needs to go ahead and\njust keep giving us a running total.\n\n354\n00:21:20.195 --> 00:21:24.094\nSo for example, if I was going to say\nwell, what's my running total here?\n\n355\n00:21:24.094 --> 00:21:29.639\nIt's just going to be B3 through,\nwell at this point B3, but\n\n356\n00:21:29.639 --> 00:21:36.860\nif I get to say this part where okay, now\nI've got party supplies as a withdrawal,\n\n357\n00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:42.740\nthat means that it needs to add up or\nsum with the negative numbers.\n\n358\n00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:48.804\nWell, then that means to go B3 through B6\nand then give me the answer right here.\n\n359\n00:21:48.804 --> 00:21:52.661\nSo it's like keep the same\nstarting point and as I go down,\n\n360\n00:21:52.661 --> 00:21:56.222\nI wanna go ahead and\nget all of the range going on here.\n\n361\n00:21:56.222 --> 00:21:57.694\nSo there's two things that\nwe're gonna need to do.\n\n362\n00:21:57.694 --> 00:22:02.922\nWe're gonna need to set up that we want to\nhave a range function, well actually a sum\n\n363\n00:22:02.922 --> 00:22:08.024\non a range, and then we need to make sure\nthat it always keeps starting at the top.\n\n364\n00:22:08.024 --> 00:22:09.880\nSo let's go through this.\n\n365\n00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:13.869\nWe're going to put our cursor in\nwhere we want the answer to go to.\n\n366\n00:22:13.869 --> 00:22:18.069\nI'm gonna zoom out so I can find my\nfunctions, or that will be the formulas.\n\n367\n00:22:18.069 --> 00:22:20.686\nCome over to my AutoSum.\n\n368\n00:22:20.686 --> 00:22:23.927\nNow this is where I want to say B3.\n\n369\n00:22:23.927 --> 00:22:28.437\nThis is where I would probably go\nahead and use the manual typing.\n\n370\n00:22:28.437 --> 00:22:30.513\nI actually put my cursor there.\n\n371\n00:22:30.513 --> 00:22:31.236\nIt was already there.\n\n372\n00:22:31.236 --> 00:22:35.811\nI put the colon B3 through B3,\nwhich might seem kind of weird\n\n373\n00:22:35.811 --> 00:22:40.752\nright now because you're like,\nwell, why don't I just put B3?\n\n374\n00:22:40.752 --> 00:22:44.531\nIt will make sense when we go ahead and\ncopy the function down, so\n\n375\n00:22:44.531 --> 00:22:46.359\njust stay with me for a second.\n\n376\n00:22:46.359 --> 00:22:49.586\nNow, if I hit Enter and said, okay,\nlet's just go ahead and then go down and\n\n377\n00:22:49.586 --> 00:22:52.819\ndo everything else, it's like,\nthat doesn't make any sense because this\n\n378\n00:22:52.819 --> 00:22:56.123\nis that whole relative reference of moving\ndown, both the references move down.\n\n379\n00:22:56.123 --> 00:23:02.035\nSo what we need to do is\nfix something in place.\n\n380\n00:23:02.035 --> 00:23:05.863\nI've also heard this be referred to as\nlocking a cell or locking a reference.\n\n381\n00:23:05.863 --> 00:23:10.846\nI personally don't like to use\nthe terminology of lock because you\n\n382\n00:23:10.846 --> 00:23:14.145\ncan lock cells and\nthe protection of cells.\n\n383\n00:23:14.145 --> 00:23:17.557\nWe always talk about words and\nwhat they mean.\n\n384\n00:23:17.557 --> 00:23:21.186\nThis is where I want to\nmake an absolute reference.\n\n385\n00:23:21.186 --> 00:23:27.198\nThat's the technical terminology\nof always start at $1000.\n\n386\n00:23:27.198 --> 00:23:32.970\nSo in this particular sense, when I\ncopy this down, I want this to stay put.\n\n387\n00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:36.891\nSo if we put a dollar sign in\nfront of the column reference,\n\n388\n00:23:36.891 --> 00:23:41.612\na dollar sign in front of the row\nreference, in this one it's not gonna\n\n389\n00:23:41.612 --> 00:23:45.875\nmake a difference because\nit's still gonna show $1000.\n\n390\n00:23:45.875 --> 00:23:48.598\nIt's fine.\nIt's when we take this and\n\n391\n00:23:48.598 --> 00:23:54.253\ncopy down That it will keep that\nfixed as an absolute reference.\n\n392\n00:23:54.253 --> 00:24:00.263\nSo in this one,\nwe'd go from B3 through B4 through B5,\n\n393\n00:24:00.263 --> 00:24:03.461\n6, 7, 8 and B3 stays put.\n\n394\n00:24:03.461 --> 00:24:06.551\nWe're saying this reference doesn't move,\nso that can be quite handy.\n\n395\n00:24:06.551 --> 00:24:11.822\nAnd now you can see that I'm not doing\ntoo bad on my bank account right now,\n\n396\n00:24:11.822 --> 00:24:16.330\nbut that's where we have a running\ntotal is using that absolute\n\n397\n00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:21.281\nreference mixed with a relative\nreference to go ahead and copy that.\n\n398\n00:24:21.281 --> 00:24:25.913\nAnd there's one other thing that I\nwanted to point out for you guys.\n\n399\n00:24:25.913 --> 00:24:27.139\nLet's just go ahead.\n\n400\n00:24:27.139 --> 00:24:27.926\nI went too far.\n\n401\n00:24:27.926 --> 00:24:32.841\nI wanted to delete these,\nis another shortcut for copying down.\n\n402\n00:24:32.841 --> 00:24:35.860\nI said we can pull down\nby using the fill handle.\n\n403\n00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:41.905\nYou could also double click with the fill\nhandle and it will automatically\n\n404\n00:24:41.905 --> 00:24:47.769\nfill down to as far as it can see your\nnumbers, so I really like that one.\n\n405\n00:24:47.769 --> 00:24:52.667\nThe other one that you could do is you\ncould select your whole range of where\n\n406\n00:24:52.667 --> 00:24:55.432\nyou want that first cell to copy down, and\n\n407\n00:24:55.432 --> 00:24:59.633\nin this case, since it's down,\nit's Ctrl D, which is down.\n\n408\n00:24:59.633 --> 00:25:04.060\nIf you were going across,\nyou could select that and do Ctrl R,\n\n409\n00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:09.186\nwhich would be for the right and\nit will go ahead and copy your function.\n\n410\n00:25:09.186 --> 00:25:13.226\nSo quite a few different ways and examples\nof how we can use the sum function.\n\n411\n00:25:13.226 --> 00:25:16.215\nHopefully this is kind of\ntriggering some like I can do,\n\n412\n00:25:16.215 --> 00:25:19.087\nI know how to do that now and\nI can go ahead and use this in.\n\n413\n00:25:19.087 --> 00:25:22.161\nWhether it's your real life or\nin your business,\n\n414\n00:25:22.161 --> 00:25:27.209\nit is probably one of the most popular and\nmost used functions within Excel because\n\n415\n00:25:27.209 --> 00:25:32.058\nthat's what we're usually doing is\npulling up some numbers, so there we go.\n\n416\n00:25:32.058 --> 00:25:34.638\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne, I do have a quick\nquestion for you, you said Ctrl D.\n\n417\n00:25:34.638 --> 00:25:38.259\nAre these shortcuts platform specific?\n\n418\n00:25:38.259 --> 00:25:42.662\nIf I'm on a Mac is that now Cmd\nversus Ctrl D for Windows or\n\n419\n00:25:42.662 --> 00:25:44.931\ndo they map those either or?\n\n420\n00:25:44.931 --> 00:25:48.687\n&gt;&gt; As far as I know,\nI'm pretty sure that they are the same.\n\n421\n00:25:48.687 --> 00:25:49.746\nI know I have done this in Mac.\n\n422\n00:25:49.746 --> 00:25:55.673\nThe Cmd R I'm kinda questioning\njust in case, but I don't know why.\n\n423\n00:25:55.673 --> 00:26:00.021\nMaybe it's triggering something,\nbut it should be the same.\n\n424\n00:26:00.021 --> 00:26:04.615\nIf not, we can always consult the oracle\nand look at all of our keyboard shortcuts.\n\n425\n00:26:04.615 --> 00:26:07.733\nSo that would be what\nI would be doing now,\n\n426\n00:26:07.733 --> 00:26:11.930\ndown on the computer is are they\nthe same in a Mac and a PC?\n\n427\n00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:12.457\nBut good question.\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha,\n\n428\n00:26:12.457 --> 00:26:14.186\nI know that sometimes trips me up,\n\n429\n00:26:14.186 --> 00:26:18.256\nespecially on some of my development work\nflows, but thank you so much, Vonne.\n\n430\n00:26:18.256 --> 00:26:22.475\nI will tell you we saw some handy,\nhandy, handy shortcuts,\n\n431\n00:26:22.475 --> 00:26:26.944\nexcept the real power starts to\nshine when you don't have 10 or\n\n432\n00:26:26.944 --> 00:26:32.112\n15 fields, but instead 1,000,\n10,000, 30,000.\n\n433\n00:26:32.112 --> 00:26:37.239\nWhere transaction laws, things of\nthat nature, I need to get the sum,\n\n434\n00:26:37.239 --> 00:26:41.175\nsee what I have at the end of the month or\nend of the year.\n\n435\n00:26:41.175 --> 00:26:43.191\nThen you're like,\nI'm glad I know these shortcuts.\n\n436\n00:26:43.191 --> 00:26:47.308\nSo thank you so much,\nour very own Excel maven.\n\n437\n00:26:47.308 --> 00:26:49.146\nBut it does look like we are running\nout of time for this episode,\n\n438\n00:26:49.146 --> 00:26:50.011\nbut definitely join us back.\n\n439\n00:26:50.011 --> 00:26:54.027\nWe've got more Excel\nfunctions coming to you.\n\n440\n00:26:54.027 --> 00:26:55.478\nBut for now we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for Office Pro TV.\n\n441\n00:26:55.478 --> 00:26:58.265\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n442\n00:26:58.265 --> 00:26:58.799\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n443\n00:26:58.799 --> 00:27:01.188\n&gt;&gt;

OfficePro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.637 --> 00:00:17.317\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n4\n00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:20.453\nAnd in today's episode, we're coming\nback with more Excel functions In\n\n5\n00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:22.488\nparticular we are going\nto be looking at sum if.\n\n6\n00:00:22.488 --> 00:00:27.110\nNow we've touched on sum,\nsum if sounds a little interesting, but\n\n7\n00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.282\nluckily we have our very\nown Excel maven here.\n\n8\n00:00:30.282 --> 00:00:30.907\nMs. Vonne Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:30.907 --> 00:00:31.644\nHow you doing today Vonne?\n\n10\n00:00:31.644 --> 00:00:32.546\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing wonderful.\n\n11\n00:00:32.546 --> 00:00:33.115\nHow are you?\n\n12\n00:00:33.115 --> 00:00:34.714\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic.\n\n13\n00:00:34.714 --> 00:00:37.428\nIt was a little hot earlier,\nit got a little bit muggy, but\n\n14\n00:00:37.428 --> 00:00:40.046\nnow it's starting to cool down,\nwe're all good to go.\n\n15\n00:00:40.046 --> 00:00:45.655\nI'm kind of interested in sum if, it's fun\nto say, then what does it actually do?\n\n16\n00:00:45.655 --> 00:00:47.986\n&gt;&gt; Well it does exactly what it says.\n\n17\n00:00:47.986 --> 00:00:50.371\n[LAUGH] I love to define things,\n\n18\n00:00:50.371 --> 00:00:54.600\nit's going to sum if it\nmeets a certain criteria.\n\n19\n00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.512\nSo in our previous episodes, we were\ntalking about all the different ways,\n\n20\n00:00:57.512 --> 00:00:59.206\nwe can go ahead and\nadd up all of our numbers.\n\n21\n00:00:59.206 --> 00:01:02.490\nWe're saying,\nall of the numbers within this range.\n\n22\n00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.724\nWell now what we're gonna say is,\nokay, well go ahead and\n\n23\n00:01:05.724 --> 00:01:10.227\nadd up the numbers in this range, but only\nif it meets a criteria somewhere else.\n\n24\n00:01:10.227 --> 00:01:14.161\nOkay, so this is where we go ahead and\nsay something like hey,\n\n25\n00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:18.969\nlet's go ahead and add up all of our\ntotals, if the category equals toys.\n\n26\n00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:20.837\nOkay, perfect, that sounds wonderful.\n\n27\n00:01:20.837 --> 00:01:24.367\nAnd these are probably scenarios that\nyou're gonna have to do a lot of times.\n\n28\n00:01:24.367 --> 00:01:26.319\nWe're okay, well let's go ahead and\n\n29\n00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:29.370\nadd up everything if it's\nat the store Gainesville.\n\n30\n00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.700\nAnd I already started going in\nthe multiple criteria's and just realize\n\n31\n00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.306\nlike no, cuz if I do multiple criterias,\nthat would be at some ifs with an s.\n\n32\n00:01:40.306 --> 00:01:42.886\nSo we're gonna say that for\nanother episode.\n\n33\n00:01:42.886 --> 00:01:47.553\nBut just a kinda pretty warn you if you\ndo need multiple ifs of summing, you will\n\n34\n00:01:47.553 --> 00:01:52.692\nhave to do a separate function, and that\nis a separate episode, so just to clarify.\n\n35\n00:01:52.692 --> 00:01:55.105\n&gt;&gt; Okay, okay, we got a little\nbit of foreshadowing there.\n\n36\n00:01:55.105 --> 00:01:59.261\nWe do have some clarification, but\nyou get one criteria for a sum if, right?\n\n37\n00:01:59.261 --> 00:02:02.229\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, and so\nwhy don't we go ahead and\n\n38\n00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.027\ndo the implementation of this topic and\njump down into our file here.\n\n39\n00:02:07.027 --> 00:02:10.139\nSo they have some of the same stuff\nwe have been looking at in some\n\n40\n00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.684\nother episodes or maybe you will be\nseeing them in some other episodes.\n\n41\n00:02:13.684 --> 00:02:17.276\nThis is where we have our sales\nrepresentatives our categories with\n\n42\n00:02:17.276 --> 00:02:20.460\nthe unit price, quantity,\nand total as you can see.\n\n43\n00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.573\nSo if I wanted to just sum up the totals\nfor all of our sales reps and\n\n44\n00:02:25.573 --> 00:02:31.841\nour toys, we can go ahead and write our\nautosum or just a regular sum function.\n\n45\n00:02:31.841 --> 00:02:35.201\nGo ahead and grab our arguments over here,\nand whoops, that's too much, so\n\n46\n00:02:35.201 --> 00:02:36.764\nlet's go ahead and try that again.\n\n47\n00:02:36.764 --> 00:02:40.285\nI will do the other way, and\nlet's go ahead and add all those up.\n\n48\n00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:45.596\nSo we had about 13,\n$1400 or so, in sales here.\n\n49\n00:02:45.596 --> 00:02:48.180\nBut now I wanna go ahead, and\n\n50\n00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.477\nonly give me the sum of the totals for\nthe category of toys.\n\n51\n00:02:53.477 --> 00:02:56.394\nSo let's go ahead and\nwrite this particular function.\n\n52\n00:02:56.394 --> 00:03:00.964\nLet's start off by writing our\nfunction from the insert formula or\n\n53\n00:03:00.964 --> 00:03:02.683\nfunction dialogue box.\n\n54\n00:03:02.683 --> 00:03:04.805\nAnd I have my most recently used, and\n\n55\n00:03:04.805 --> 00:03:07.961\nthat's because I've been\ndoing some examples here.\n\n56\n00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:10.390\nSo I have it right ready to go.\n\n57\n00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.240\nIf you need to,\nyou can always use your search, and\n\n58\n00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.250\neverything like we've done\nin some other episodes.\n\n59\n00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.737\nSo let's find the SUMIF,\nand then we click OK.\n\n60\n00:03:17.737 --> 00:03:20.994\nAnd let's read what it's asking us to do.\n\n61\n00:03:20.994 --> 00:03:23.850\nIt says that we need a range,\n\n62\n00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.576\nas the cells specified by\na given condition or criteria.\n\n63\n00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:34.452\nSo this is the one, the range of cells\nthat you want evaluated not the ones that\n\n64\n00:03:34.452 --> 00:03:37.691\nyou want to be added up,\nthat is a different field.\n\n65\n00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:42.905\nThis is the range of the criteria, so just\nkind of make sure you clarify that and\n\n66\n00:03:42.905 --> 00:03:45.753\nread the descriptions that it had in here.\n\n67\n00:03:45.753 --> 00:03:50.112\nSo we want to base it on our category, and\n\n68\n00:03:50.112 --> 00:03:55.002\nI'm going to select from B2 through B21.\n\n69\n00:03:55.002 --> 00:04:00.409\nLook at these range of cells and\nthen tell me what the toys are.\n\n70\n00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:04.343\nSo I'm gonna click my cursor down into\nthe criteria and for this example,\n\n71\n00:04:04.343 --> 00:04:06.252\nI'm gonna use the cell reference.\n\n72\n00:04:06.252 --> 00:04:12.149\nSo I'm gonna come over here, and click on\nH4, because I already have that typed in.\n\n73\n00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:14.709\nSo I'm gonna,\ninstead of physically typing in toys,\n\n74\n00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.609\nI'm gonna use the cell reference here.\n\n75\n00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.300\nAnd then I'm going to\nthen add up my Sum_range,\n\n76\n00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:25.020\nlet's read that right there,\nthe actual cells to sum.\n\n77\n00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.750\nOkay, perfect, that's what I wanna do.\n\n78\n00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.170\nSo let's go out and\nselect all of the totals,\n\n79\n00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.143\nwhich would be from E2 through E21.\n\n80\n00:04:33.143 --> 00:04:35.093\nYou can see that I do have a result,\n\n81\n00:04:35.093 --> 00:04:38.060\nso looks like I'm on my way\nof writing it correctly.\n\n82\n00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.815\nYou click OK and then there you go.\n\n83\n00:04:39.815 --> 00:04:42.869\nI have already preformatted this cell,\nby the way, to be in currency.\n\n84\n00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:46.630\nSo you can see that that is it, and\nif you wanted to test this out,\n\n85\n00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.706\nbecause I'm always like\nis this working properly?\n\n86\n00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:53.603\nLet's come over here to our data and\nlet's sort it,\n\n87\n00:04:53.603 --> 00:04:57.066\nlet's come over here and\nsort this from a to z.\n\n88\n00:04:57.066 --> 00:04:59.785\nAnd you can see there had changes\nfrom Accessories, Clothing, Toys.\n\n89\n00:04:59.785 --> 00:05:04.430\nLet's look at down here, Toys,\nI will select all of these numbers.\n\n90\n00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.202\nI can look down at my status bar\ndown here, and it does say yep, 354.\n\n91\n00:05:09.202 --> 00:05:13.764\nThat says 354, I think we are good and\nlet's move up.\n\n92\n00:05:13.764 --> 00:05:16.110\nThere you go.\nYep, it's correct, wonderful, right.\n\n93\n00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.857\nSo you know that you can\ntrust the results here.\n\n94\n00:05:19.857 --> 00:05:22.137\nNow if I wanted to change this.\n\n95\n00:05:22.137 --> 00:05:23.345\nLet me just go ahead and\n\n96\n00:05:23.345 --> 00:05:27.172\nshow you that if I wanted to change\nthis back to just hard coding of toys.\n\n97\n00:05:27.172 --> 00:05:30.444\nLet's open up the insert\nfunction dialog box again.\n\n98\n00:05:30.444 --> 00:05:35.095\nAnd in the criteria, instead of using that\ncell reference, let's get rid of that and\n\n99\n00:05:35.095 --> 00:05:36.331\ntype in the word toys.\n\n100\n00:05:36.331 --> 00:05:41.233\nNow I am going to give you a quick\nlittle demonstration here that I'm\n\n101\n00:05:41.233 --> 00:05:45.450\nusing at lower case toys,\nand not an upper case Toys.\n\n102\n00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:50.698\nAnd it will still find it because in\nthis scenario, it is not case sensitive.\n\n103\n00:05:50.698 --> 00:05:55.330\nBut it does need to match\ncompletely what is in there.\n\n104\n00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.472\nFor example, if I typed in T-O-O-Y, so\n\n105\n00:05:58.472 --> 00:06:03.201\ntooys in here, notice that my\nresult in here is going to be zero.\n\n106\n00:06:03.201 --> 00:06:07.440\nCuz it does have to do an exact\nmatch when we're using the sum if,\n\n107\n00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.491\nI need to make sure it matches.\n\n108\n00:06:09.491 --> 00:06:15.093\nAnd notice another thing that it does go\nahead and put parenthesis around text.\n\n109\n00:06:15.093 --> 00:06:19.235\nBecause if it's seeing a string of text,\nit does need to have those quotations\n\n110\n00:06:19.235 --> 00:06:23.213\naround it to make sure that it understands\nthat and that's what you can do.\n\n111\n00:06:23.213 --> 00:06:28.132\nNow which way you wanna do, cell reference\nversus hard coding, completely up to you.\n\n112\n00:06:28.132 --> 00:06:32.290\nIf you had done, I'm just gonna\ndo a Ctrl+Z to back up once.\n\n113\n00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.679\nThe nice thing about doing a cell\nreference is you can go ahead and\n\n114\n00:06:34.679 --> 00:06:35.217\nchange this.\n\n115\n00:06:35.217 --> 00:06:41.230\nIf I typed in clothing and then hit Enter\nor Tab, notice it's going to change.\n\n116\n00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:48.232\nBecause it's just taking whatever is\nin the contents of cell, that is H4.\n\n117\n00:06:48.232 --> 00:06:53.736\nAnd then going ahead and using that as our\ncriteria cuz that could be kind of fun.\n\n118\n00:06:53.736 --> 00:06:57.572\nNow you can also use operators\nthat are like greater than or\n\n119\n00:06:57.572 --> 00:07:01.680\nless than when you want to go ahead and\ndo an if statement.\n\n120\n00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.261\nNotice here, if I want to add up\nthe total price of all items with\n\n121\n00:07:06.261 --> 00:07:09.039\nthe unit price that is less than 15.\n\n122\n00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:12.176\nSo if I come over here,\nunit price, let's go ahead and\n\n123\n00:07:12.176 --> 00:07:15.533\nsort it first to make sure\nthat we're getting this right.\n\n124\n00:07:15.533 --> 00:07:17.045\nLet's go smallest to largest.\n\n125\n00:07:17.045 --> 00:07:22.116\nSo less than 15, so\nthat would mean all of these.\n\n126\n00:07:22.116 --> 00:07:26.257\nSo numbers here, let's go ahead and\nlook at the result,\n\n127\n00:07:26.257 --> 00:07:30.331\nit says down here,\nthat the sum is going to be $486.\n\n128\n00:07:30.331 --> 00:07:33.073\nIt's down on the status bar behind\nmy head just to let you know.\n\n129\n00:07:33.073 --> 00:07:36.444\nSo we can go ahead and see,\nyep, there's some of 486, so\n\n130\n00:07:36.444 --> 00:07:38.971\nwe know that that's what\nwe are looking for.\n\n131\n00:07:38.971 --> 00:07:45.114\nLet's write the formula here, and let's\njust start for fun, let's type it out.\n\n132\n00:07:45.114 --> 00:07:49.641\nWe're going to say =SUMIF,\nhit the Tab key.\n\n133\n00:07:49.641 --> 00:07:50.702\nWhat is my range?\n\n134\n00:07:50.702 --> 00:07:56.469\nNow remember from that dialogue box\nthat we need to look at the Unit Price.\n\n135\n00:07:56.469 --> 00:08:02.870\nHere, and then we'll say look at all\nof this, the criteria will be, wait.\n\n136\n00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:06.790\nBefore I go,\nI need to make sure I put the comma,\n\n137\n00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:10.250\ncuz since I'm writing the formula,\nI do have to put that syntax in there.\n\n138\n00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:15.520\nSo making sure that I'm following the laws\nof Excel here when I'm writing it.\n\n139\n00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.570\nOtherwise, you're gonna get errors,\nand it happens to me all the time.\n\n140\n00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:22.130\nSo we're going to now say\nthe criteria is this particular cell,\n\n141\n00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:25.690\nthat means less than 15,\ngo ahead and put that comma in.\n\n142\n00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:28.330\nSo now,\nwhat is the range that I need to add up?\n\n143\n00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:32.030\nAnd we will go with total,\nlet's take all of these.\n\n144\n00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:37.013\nAnd that's about looks right,\nwe hit Enter, and yeah, it is 486.\n\n145\n00:08:37.013 --> 00:08:41.179\nYes, this is working\nswimmingly right here.\n\n146\n00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:46.394\nAnd you wanna point out something right\nnow that, it's funny because, if you\n\n147\n00:08:46.394 --> 00:08:52.720\ndon't do it exactly the right way, you're\ngonna have some really weird results.\n\n148\n00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.990\nLet me explain what I'm talking about,\nyou're like,\n\n149\n00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.630\nI have no idea what you're talking about.\n\n150\n00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:59.090\nI'm almost not sure what I'm\ntalking about right now.\n\n151\n00:08:59.090 --> 00:08:59.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Where am I going?\n\n152\n00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.850\nOkay, I know where we're going.\n\n153\n00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:05.252\nRight here, notice in this particular one,\n\n154\n00:09:05.252 --> 00:09:09.907\nif I double-click to go ahead and\nget my cursor to color code,\n\n155\n00:09:09.907 --> 00:09:15.476\nwhere my variables are coming in,\nnotice that I selected B2 thru B21.\n\n156\n00:09:15.476 --> 00:09:20.321\nThis one is B or E2 thru E21.\n\n157\n00:09:20.321 --> 00:09:24.360\nBut in this one right here,\nI used the headings.\n\n158\n00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.950\nAnd then some of you might be asking, well\nwait, do I have to include the headings,\n\n159\n00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:28.980\ndo I not include the headings?\n\n160\n00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.770\nWell you can see right here,\nit doesn't matter,\n\n161\n00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:34.880\nbecause you are saying, use this criteria.\n\n162\n00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:40.875\nSo it's looking at these entire range, and\nunit price does not equal the criteria,\n\n163\n00:09:40.875 --> 00:09:44.513\nwhich is less than 15,\nso you'll be okay there.\n\n164\n00:09:44.513 --> 00:09:49.116\nThe biggest thing to know about this is if\nyou pull a heading in one of your ranges,\n\n165\n00:09:49.116 --> 00:09:51.569\nyou have to pull the heading and\nthe other.\n\n166\n00:09:51.569 --> 00:09:55.672\nYou have to make sure it matches, okay,\n\n167\n00:09:55.672 --> 00:10:00.720\nso you can not or do, but\nit's got to be the same.\n\n168\n00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.864\nLet me just give you an example here,\nif I went and said well, for\n\n169\n00:10:03.864 --> 00:10:05.038\nthis one I wanna do C2.\n\n170\n00:10:05.038 --> 00:10:08.677\nNotice the color changes, that I'm\nnot including the heading here, and\n\n171\n00:10:08.677 --> 00:10:11.050\nI hit Enter, that is not the same, is it?\n\n172\n00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:17.170\nNo, we were at 486, so it has to match up,\nthis has to match with this.\n\n173\n00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:20.670\nIf it does this,\nthings are gonna be wonky, and\n\n174\n00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:22.220\nyou're not gonna get the results.\n\n175\n00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:26.040\n&gt;&gt; It seems like missing the rung\non a ladder as you're climbing up,\n\n176\n00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.070\nthings will just fall apart and\nit will get real dicey after that.\n\n177\n00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:31.600\nSo you have to go one, one, right?\n\n178\n00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.340\nYour feet meet every rung on the ladder,\nand\n\n179\n00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:38.632\nlikewise, you wanna make sure that you\nhave kinda this one-to-one correspondence.\n\n180\n00:10:38.632 --> 00:10:39.680\n[SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n181\n00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.790\n&gt;&gt; And that way you don't have wonkiness.\n\n182\n00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:43.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and the thing is if I,\n\n183\n00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:48.430\nif this is a really large data set, I'd\nbe like you think you can just trust it.\n\n184\n00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:51.261\nAnd that's where, you can trust it,\nif you write it right.\n\n185\n00:10:51.261 --> 00:10:53.829\n[LAUGH] So if you just be\na little bit careful on that, so\n\n186\n00:10:53.829 --> 00:10:56.011\nI wanted to emphasize\nthat point right here.\n\n187\n00:10:56.011 --> 00:10:59.647\nAnd the other thing I wanted to emphasize,\non this particular example of\n\n188\n00:10:59.647 --> 00:11:02.890\nusing the operators,\nlike the greater than, the hard coding.\n\n189\n00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:07.540\nIf I came up to here, and changed this,\nlet's first of all, let's change this back\n\n190\n00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:11.110\nto match, so now we have E2 and\nC2, all right, we're good there.\n\n191\n00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:14.703\nAnd we wanna say less than 15.\n\n192\n00:11:14.703 --> 00:11:18.557\nAnd you can already tell,\nas soon as I start typing in a formula and\n\n193\n00:11:18.557 --> 00:11:23.020\nthe colors start changing,\nthey disappear, something's wrong.\n\n194\n00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:26.060\nSo if I hit Enter, and\nit's also gonna give me this error saying,\n\n195\n00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:30.360\nhey, there's a problem,\nwhat are you trying to do?\n\n196\n00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.310\nSo the first character's an equal.\n\n197\n00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:35.360\nOkay, well that's not really\ngiving you necessarily\n\n198\n00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.860\nthe exact information that you need.\n\n199\n00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.590\nThe biggest thing to note is that\neven though this is an operator,\n\n200\n00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:44.490\nyou have to still put\nthis in quotation marks.\n\n201\n00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:47.280\nYou have to still treat\nit as a string of text,\n\n202\n00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:51.940\njust like you did when we hard coded\nthis from the cell reference of\n\n203\n00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:56.380\ntoys to the word toys, it needs to\nhave those quotations around it.\n\n204\n00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:01.550\nSo just because you think, well this is a\nnumber, and I'm saying less than or equal\n\n205\n00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:07.270\nto, or whatever, greater than or equal to\nan number, it's still treated as text.\n\n206\n00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:08.510\nBut just make sure you remember that.\n\n207\n00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:11.220\nAnd that's why, of course,\nusing the insert function dialog box,\n\n208\n00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:15.050\nif you just physically type that in,\nit would put the quotes around it for you.\n\n209\n00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:19.812\nSo just be aware of it, and\nbe careful with that one.\n\n210\n00:12:19.812 --> 00:12:24.160\nAll right, and this is basically just\nanother example, just another variation.\n\n211\n00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.840\nLet's use the SUMIF, and we are going\nwith, let me read what I wrote down.\n\n212\n00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.970\nTotal price of all items with\na quantity greater than, so quantity.\n\n213\n00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:35.140\nSo I need to make sure I'm\npulling the right one.\n\n214\n00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:38.450\nI'll grab the heading in this one, just\nmaking sure I need to match it up with\n\n215\n00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:41.620\nthe rungs on a ladder,\nI like that analogy.\n\n216\n00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:45.960\nThe criteria is going to\nbe this particular cell.\n\n217\n00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:51.680\nAnd then this sum range would then be all\nof the total, grabbing the heading here.\n\n218\n00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.495\nAnd we hit, yep, that's right, 680,\n\n219\n00:12:54.495 --> 00:12:58.465\nthat's perfect, so\nyou can see that we're going to do that.\n\n220\n00:12:58.465 --> 00:13:00.873\nRight, little bit of absolute referencing,\n\n221\n00:13:00.873 --> 00:13:04.320\nI'm going to reference\nthe absolute reference right here.\n\n222\n00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.510\nBecause you need to make sure when\nyou're starting to copy down,\n\n223\n00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:10.720\nbecause I can see that, you might have\nsomething in your organization where I\n\n224\n00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:16.040\nneed to pull out sum all of these\ntotals if it meets these criterias.\n\n225\n00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:20.296\nAnd I don't wanna have to do it more than\nonce, I wanna go ahead and do it once and\n\n226\n00:13:20.296 --> 00:13:21.610\ncopy it down.\n\n227\n00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:27.170\nLet's go to this steps, insert function,\nSUMIF, we need to do the range.\n\n228\n00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:29.620\nAnd you're like well Vonne,\nyou've already did this once before.\n\n229\n00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:33.090\nWhy don't you just go ahead and copy\nthe formulas you had, that you wrote for\n\n230\n00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:34.460\nthe toys and everything like that?\n\n231\n00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:38.370\nRemember the whole\ncopying of a function or\n\n232\n00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:41.215\na formula,\nit's using that relative reference.\n\n233\n00:13:41.215 --> 00:13:43.500\nYou'd have to go and\nchange all the references anyway.\n\n234\n00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:44.950\nSo saying, well, from here to here,\n\n235\n00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:49.500\nit's much easier just to start over and\nmove forward from there.\n\n236\n00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.480\nSo let's go with\nthe criteria of Accessories,\n\n237\n00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.000\nwhich will actually be cell H15.\n\n238\n00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.370\nWe will sum up, did I use B1,\nokay so I need to make sure I pull\n\n239\n00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:04.150\nthe heading there, making sure I've\ngo that, and then we click OK.\n\n240\n00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:08.360\nGreat, just what I talked about,\nthe relative reference.\n\n241\n00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:12.310\nYou pull this down and you're thinking,\nwell great those are the numbers.\n\n242\n00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:16.710\nI didn't get a weird error or\na dash or anything that would be\n\n243\n00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:20.720\nkinda strange in here, this is where\nyou should always double-check.\n\n244\n00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.920\nAnd this will especially ring true,\nwatch the values here.\n\n245\n00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:31.280\nSo let's just say, okay, 184, okay, 5,\n300, just to kinda get our bearings.\n\n246\n00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:35.025\nCome over here to this particular column,\nand let's sort Z to A.\n\n247\n00:14:35.025 --> 00:14:38.032\nDid you see that number change down there,\nJustin?\n\n248\n00:14:38.032 --> 00:14:39.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Let me sort it A to Z,\n\n249\n00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.020\nthere's another one.\n\n250\n00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:44.190\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna give you a little\nbit of a math lesson here.\n\n251\n00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:47.816\nEven if it is conditional summing,\norder shouldn't matter for\n\n252\n00:14:47.816 --> 00:14:50.378\nactually summing things together, right?\n\n253\n00:14:50.378 --> 00:14:52.020\n3 plus 2 is 2 plus 3.\n\n254\n00:14:53.202 --> 00:14:57.190\nThose are, it's what's called commutative\noperations, so order shouldn't matter,\n\n255\n00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:58.640\neven though you are building, essentially,\n\n256\n00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.510\na mask to mask out some\nof the summed ranges.\n\n257\n00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:03.660\nBut, eh, gets a little weird.\n\n258\n00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:06.325\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so this is where,\nwhere is the error?\n\n259\n00:15:06.325 --> 00:15:10.446\nEven though it's not giving me\na blinking flashing reference or\n\n260\n00:15:10.446 --> 00:15:12.630\nvalue error, lets look at this.\n\n261\n00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:18.380\nLet's go to toys, double-clicking\nthe color codes have shifted, right?\n\n262\n00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:22.900\nIf you come down here, that is right,\nwe want this, cuz we want the accessories.\n\n263\n00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.336\nWhoops, whoa, whoa,\nhello, sorry about that.\n\n264\n00:15:25.336 --> 00:15:28.452\n[LAUGH] Let's go ahead, it's nice to know\nthat we can always click on that, and\n\n265\n00:15:28.452 --> 00:15:30.390\ngo ahead and get some information on it.\n\n266\n00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:33.920\nLet's change down to here,\nthere's that relative reference.\n\n267\n00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:38.610\nYes, I want you to move down when\nI copy to do all of my criterias,\n\n268\n00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:41.970\nbut always go back to the same range.\n\n269\n00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:46.590\nAll right, absolute referencing coming\nback up into our original formula.\n\n270\n00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:50.030\nWe need to lock down if we want to say,\n\n271\n00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:54.380\nI've talked about in other one,\nwhy is that not working?\n\n272\n00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:54.964\nThere we go.\n[LAUGH].\n\n273\n00:15:54.964 --> 00:15:58.492\nYou need to make sure you hold your Shift\nkey when you hit the 4 to go ahead and\n\n274\n00:15:58.492 --> 00:15:59.958\nget that dollar sign in there.\n\n275\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:03.512\nSo you can get that absolute\nreference in there.\n\n276\n00:16:03.512 --> 00:16:08.740\nRemember your shortcut on a Windows\nkeyboard is F4, your function key.\n\n277\n00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:12.550\nThat's where I can't do this on my virtual\nmachine cuz it's not mapped to it.\n\n278\n00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:13.290\nI probably should.\n\n279\n00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:14.220\nEvery time I do this I'm like,\n\n280\n00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:18.990\nyou should go ahead and map that keyboard\nshortcut to make your life a lot easier.\n\n281\n00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:21.800\nAnd I'm trying to talk and\ntype at the same time,\n\n282\n00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.070\nand it's starting to get\nme a little messed up.\n\n283\n00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:25.740\nOkay, let's make sure\nI'm doing this right.\n\n284\n00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:27.690\nThat needs to be a dollar sign.\n\n285\n00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:28.560\nThere we go.\n\n286\n00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.700\nAnd one, two, three, four.\n\n287\n00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:31.750\nAll right, I got it.\n\n288\n00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:36.980\nSo now I'm changing this to an absolute\nreference here when I copy this down.\n\n289\n00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:40.400\nNow the numbers,\nI know they're the same, but\n\n290\n00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.100\njust to make sure that\nI'm doing this correctly.\n\n291\n00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:44.910\nNow you can see when I jump into this.\n\n292\n00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:49.270\nYup, same range and\nthen we come down to this, ooh, stop it.\n\n293\n00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.650\nCome down to here, yeah, same range, yes,\n\n294\n00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:57.420\nwe're always going to keep\naccessing the same category and\n\n295\n00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:01.910\ntotal range, and that will make sure that\nyour numbers are definitely correct.\n\n296\n00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:04.490\nSo don't always trust it,\n\n297\n00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:08.460\njust make sure you do everything properly,\nand then you can.\n\n298\n00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:12.600\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne, you kinda bring up\nsomething that always got me about Excel.\n\n299\n00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:17.381\nWe have these kind of\nranges that are C1 to C21.\n\n300\n00:17:17.381 --> 00:17:19.230\nAnd I know we have named ranges.\n\n301\n00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:22.430\nCan we use named ranges with the sum if?\n\n302\n00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:25.518\n&gt;&gt; Of course, you must see the next\nworksheet down there, don't you?\n\n303\n00:17:25.518 --> 00:17:29.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm sitting off to the side\n\n304\n00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:31.220\nquietly scoping out what we're doing.\n\n305\n00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:32.428\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n306\n00:17:32.428 --> 00:17:33.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, but\n\n307\n00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:36.120\nit is something helpful\nfrom my point of view.\n\n308\n00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:39.030\nReadability is important, especially when\nyou're trying to reason about something.\n\n309\n00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:42.890\nAlso it prevents mistakes in\nmy kind of biased opinion.\n\n310\n00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:47.760\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and if you watch more of\nthese episodes I'm gonna keep coming back\n\n311\n00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.760\nto it and you're going, man, she's\nreally drilling down that named ranges.\n\n312\n00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.610\nAnd it really does make a big difference.\n\n313\n00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:55.170\nAnd I have some examples here.\n\n314\n00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:58.670\nYou can see that I went ahead and\nused the Category, so\n\n315\n00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:02.080\nthat is going to be my criteria range.\n\n316\n00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:05.780\nH4 is still just a regular cell reference,\nand then the Total Sales.\n\n317\n00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.380\nAnd the nice thing about\nusing named ranges,\n\n318\n00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:12.560\nespecially like where we were just\nat with the copying, right here.\n\n319\n00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:13.530\nWell, let's look at this.\n\n320\n00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:16.350\nIt's saying okay, well,\nit looks like everything's already done.\n\n321\n00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:20.240\nI don't have to worry about those putting\nthe dollar signs in for each one of\n\n322\n00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:25.480\nthe cell references, to make sure we\nhave that locked range or fixed range.\n\n323\n00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.150\nJust use the named range cuz\nthat's always gonna be that way.\n\n324\n00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:30.440\nIt's just one less step\nthat you have to do.\n\n325\n00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:34.390\nNow of course, yes, you have to go\nahead and use the named ranges.\n\n326\n00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:36.910\nBut it's super easy when you have\nheadings, just select it all and\n\n327\n00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:39.970\nuse the create name from selection,\nand that's great.\n\n328\n00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:41.660\nSo they're like yay,\nthis is gonna go down, and\n\n329\n00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.900\nwe'll do that double-click\nthat we learned about how,\n\n330\n00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:47.870\nand you're like, uh-oh, wait, I thought\nyou said this is gonna work right!\n\n331\n00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:48.730\nI did this on purpose!\n\n332\n00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:50.790\nAll right, so let's look at this.\n\n333\n00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:55.120\nLet's jump into here, right,\neverything's fine, we're good there.\n\n334\n00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.410\nLet's go into this one.\n\n335\n00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:01.830\nHm, what changed there?\n\n336\n00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:07.910\nOkay, there's that one, and then there's\nthat one, and then there's that.\n\n337\n00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:09.940\nWait, that's still there.\n\n338\n00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:15.110\nHave any reason why this\nmight not work there, Justin?\n\n339\n00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:16.730\nI'm just going to throw it out there.\n\n340\n00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:18.430\n&gt;&gt; So these are conditions, and\n\n341\n00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:22.290\nI'm guessing it's doing some kind of\ntext matching in order to do the math.\n\n342\n00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:24.750\nIs there a hidden white\nspace character somewhere?\n\n343\n00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:26.990\nI'm just throwing it out there,\nI could be wrong.\n\n344\n00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:28.410\nOr is there a possibility of typo?\n\n345\n00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:30.165\n&gt;&gt; Ding, ding, ding.\n\n346\n00:19:30.165 --> 00:19:35.025\n[LAUGH] You got that, and\nI know from your programming background,\n\n347\n00:19:35.025 --> 00:19:38.988\nit's like you make one little extra,\n\n348\n00:19:38.988 --> 00:19:42.570\nlike a colon or something,\nit can throw everything off.\n\n349\n00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:44.600\nAnd that's exactly what I did here.\n\n350\n00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.100\nRight here on the accessories,\n\n351\n00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:50.770\nI don't know if you can see right there\nif I scroll in, there is a white space.\n\n352\n00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:55.430\nAnd that goes back to what I was saying,\nit is an exact match here, so, now,\n\n353\n00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:58.310\nthe case sensitivity,\nthat's not what we're talking about.\n\n354\n00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:59.980\nThat doesn't come into play.\n\n355\n00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:04.010\nIt's that there's an extra space,\nif I backspace or delete that.\n\n356\n00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:04.980\nHit Enter.\n\n357\n00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:05.480\nThere we go.\n\n358\n00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.080\nAll right?\n\n359\n00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.490\nSo again those little\n\n360\n00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:13.320\nkinda hidden monsters lurking in the\ncorner like I'm not gonna make you work.\n\n361\n00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:14.610\nAnd you're like why?\n\n362\n00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:18.150\nSo just trying to give you all\nthose things to kinda look for.\n\n363\n00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:20.669\nOkay, am I using, okay,\ndo I need absolute references?\n\n364\n00:20:20.669 --> 00:20:23.220\nAll right,\nis that actually doing the right way?\n\n365\n00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:25.700\nOkay, that's, is it matching perfectly?\n\n366\n00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:28.080\nThat's what we need to\nbe very careful about.\n\n367\n00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:31.770\n&gt;&gt; And Vonne, before we move past that,\nI just wanna reassure everybody.\n\n368\n00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:35.640\nLike that's part of this adventure,\nwhenever you're first interacting with\n\n369\n00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.590\nthese, you're going to\nrun into a few of those.\n\n370\n00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:39.600\nDon't worry, take a deep breath.\n\n371\n00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:43.700\nLet the frustration flow out of you,\nand eventually it will become so\n\n372\n00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.710\nsecond nature you're like\nthat's the problem right there.\n\n373\n00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:49.141\nYou'll become the person that\nmakes it very deflating.\n\n374\n00:20:49.141 --> 00:20:49.680\nWhat is wrong?\n\n375\n00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.610\nAnd you just point to I bet there's\nan extra white space character after that,\n\n376\n00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:54.200\nor hey, there's a typo.\n\n377\n00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:58.700\nSo through practice, we get better at\nbeing more proficient and efficient.\n\n378\n00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:01.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's why I try to\nthrow these little zingers in for\n\n379\n00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:04.662\nyou, so that way you can\ngo through your checklist.\n\n380\n00:21:04.662 --> 00:21:07.998\nIs it this, is it this, is it this, this,\nand then you can just like let it go, and-\n\n381\n00:21:07.998 --> 00:21:08.499\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n382\n00:21:08.499 --> 00:21:09.762\n&gt;&gt; Let that anger just fly\n\n383\n00:21:09.762 --> 00:21:12.965\non out the window and\nbecome one with the wind and the sky.\n\n384\n00:21:12.965 --> 00:21:15.018\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So sorry I had to.\n\n385\n00:21:15.018 --> 00:21:16.619\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well,\n\n386\n00:21:16.619 --> 00:21:20.752\nthat escalated to a whole different place\nthan I expected, but we'll go with it.\n\n387\n00:21:20.752 --> 00:21:23.921\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\nnow we're gonna move on to mouse toys.\n\n388\n00:21:23.921 --> 00:21:29.400\n[LAUGH] So this is where, what if I\nwanted to match part of the text?\n\n389\n00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:37.050\nThis is still a condition, okay, I want\nto, some, if it contains a specific word.\n\n390\n00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:38.260\nSo let's go through this example.\n\n391\n00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:42.240\nYou can see, and I have come over here and\nbolded some of these.\n\n392\n00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:46.610\nI also made some of them green just to\nkind of give us a reference point, so\n\n393\n00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:48.340\nwhat we're looking at here.\n\n394\n00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:49.810\nSo let's just type it in.\n\n395\n00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:53.020\nWe will say I want to do a sum if.\n\n396\n00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:58.580\nWe've already done this before, but\njust for demonstration purposes,\n\n397\n00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:03.800\nwe're going to say that the toy and\nthe criteria is going to be\n\n398\n00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:08.560\nspiral and\nthen the sum range is going to be here.\n\n399\n00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.657\nAnd then if you look, yep it is 60.\n\n400\n00:22:10.657 --> 00:22:13.080\nI didn't format the cell.\n\n401\n00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.710\nBut 36 plus 24 is 60.\n\n402\n00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:17.460\nSo it is doing that.\n\n403\n00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:19.830\nAnd just from the other example,\nwe could go ahead and\n\n404\n00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:24.310\ntype in the word spiral and,\nI gotta it in all caps.\n\n405\n00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:26.940\nOkay, well, that didn't like that.\n\n406\n00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:28.520\nWhy didn't it like that?\n\n407\n00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:29.255\nI know why.\n\n408\n00:22:29.255 --> 00:22:30.690\nJustin, do you know why?\n\n409\n00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:34.550\n&gt;&gt; You forgot to put quotes and\nit's treating it as the wrong data type.\n\n410\n00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:37.792\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\nwe're going to, there we go.\n\n411\n00:22:37.792 --> 00:22:41.570\nAnd just, I didn't realize I had my\ncaps lock on it, but it does drill home\n\n412\n00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:45.120\nthe point that it is not case sensitive\nit's when you use those quotes.\n\n413\n00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.190\nSo that's great, exact match.\n\n414\n00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:51.990\nBut what about if I wanted it to contain\nthe word mouse anywhere in here?\n\n415\n00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:53.360\nWe have heart mouse.\n\n416\n00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.460\nBeach mouse, we have a mouse tail.\n\n417\n00:22:55.460 --> 00:23:00.730\nI wanna sum up if it has that word\nsomewhere in there, that string of text.\n\n418\n00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:03.000\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n419\n00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.130\nLet's do the SUMIF.\n\n420\n00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:07.880\nAnd we're gonna do the same thing,\nhere's our range.\n\n421\n00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:11.020\nOur criteria is mouse.\n\n422\n00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:12.800\nYou know what?\nWe're gonna physically type this in\n\n423\n00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:17.880\nbecause notice, I put even in here for\nmy reference, type in value so\n\n424\n00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.380\nI can show you this in a couple steps.\n\n425\n00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:25.400\nSo we're going to say mouse, and then\nwe're going to sum up these values here.\n\n426\n00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:27.208\nThere we go.\n\n427\n00:23:27.208 --> 00:23:30.000\nWe click Enter and you can see,\nwell, wait, it says 0.\n\n428\n00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.190\nYou always said to look at that.\n\n429\n00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:33.590\nSomething's gone wrong.\n\n430\n00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:37.130\nAnd it is because it\nis not an exact match.\n\n431\n00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:42.340\nNothing in here has mouse as\nthe only word within that cell.\n\n432\n00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:46.285\nSo what we want to use here is we\nwanna use some wildcard character.\n\n433\n00:23:46.285 --> 00:23:52.155\nWe wanna say if there's anything in\nfront of the word mouse like part mouse,\n\n434\n00:23:52.155 --> 00:23:55.089\nor, and/or I guess you could say, or\n\n435\n00:23:55.089 --> 00:24:00.432\nthe other one would be if there is\nanything past it like mouse fields.\n\n436\n00:24:00.432 --> 00:24:03.756\nSo that's where we use our asterisks for\nour wildcard characters.\n\n437\n00:24:03.756 --> 00:24:10.010\nNow because this is typed in as text,\nall I have to do is put my cursor in here.\n\n438\n00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:14.670\nPut the wild card character\nin front of the m in mouse.\n\n439\n00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:20.170\nCome over here and put the wild\ncard character at the end of mouse.\n\n440\n00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:23.110\nAnd then I hit enter, and it does work.\n\n441\n00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:28.410\nAnd you can see that if we look at these,\nI'm just gonna go ahead,\n\n442\n00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:31.410\nI know that's the answer, and\nI'm not very good at adding in my head.\n\n443\n00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:35.040\nBut, yeah,\nall those numbers adding up is $347.\n\n444\n00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.640\nSo, that's perfect.\n\n445\n00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.960\nBecause I hard coded, if you want to say.\n\n446\n00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.880\nI typed in the value for that criteria.\n\n447\n00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.900\nNow, if we use it in the other way,\nso let's go ahead and\n\n448\n00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:47.270\ngo through the steps again.\n\n449\n00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:50.110\nOkay?\nJust for reiteration.\n\n450\n00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:53.120\nWe will take here, this is right there.\n\n451\n00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.610\nWe'll take our criteria.\n\n452\n00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:57.130\nHave the word mouse,\nsum up our range here.\n\n453\n00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:00.940\nAnd it's still zero because you're\nthinking, well that's fine.\n\n454\n00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:04.410\nLet's just go ahead and\nput our wild card character there,\n\n455\n00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:06.770\nand our wild card character there.\n\n456\n00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:10.260\nAnd like I said from our other example,\nthe colors have gone away.\n\n457\n00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:12.730\nIt stopped recognizing these ranges.\n\n458\n00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:14.880\nYeah, that's because you\ncan't do it this way.\n\n459\n00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:18.950\nOkay, if you're using cell references,\nconnected or\n\n460\n00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:23.980\nif you wanna say concatenated with let's\ngo ahead and find strings of text,\n\n461\n00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:28.950\nthat wildcard character needs\nto be designated as text.\n\n462\n00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:33.500\nAnd it also has to be added\ninto the cell reference.\n\n463\n00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:38.770\nSo when you're kind of mixing these\ndifferent flavors if you want to say,\n\n464\n00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:39.980\ncell references and text.\n\n465\n00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:44.660\nYou need to kind of use some other\ncharacters if you want to say,\n\n466\n00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:45.820\nto make this work out right.\n\n467\n00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:47.220\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n468\n00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:51.540\nWe're going to open the quote,\nasterisk, close the quote.\n\n469\n00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:53.286\nI'm going to try to zoom in so\nyou can see a little bit better.\n\n470\n00:25:53.286 --> 00:25:55.242\nAnd then the ampersand,\n\n471\n00:25:55.242 --> 00:25:59.910\nthis is that concatenation\nthat bring these two together.\n\n472\n00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:04.840\nSo anything in front of the mouse that\nis treated as text, add that into,\n\n473\n00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:08.800\nif you wanna say, the cell reference,\nwhatever's in the cell reference, and\n\n474\n00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:15.280\nthen on the other side, another ampersand,\nopen the quote, close the quote.\n\n475\n00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:18.160\nNow my colors are coming back,\nit likes that.\n\n476\n00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.850\nSo that's how you have to write this.\n\n477\n00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:25.580\nAnd this is something that you don't\nreally find in the insert function\n\n478\n00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:30.290\ndialog box, you just have to kinda know\nthis, you just have to know that this is\n\n479\n00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:35.420\nhow I need to marry these two things\ntogether, to make it understand\n\n480\n00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:40.360\nthat this is what I'm looking for,\nand that will give you the same value.\n\n481\n00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:45.610\nSo it can be a little weird if you're not\nused to seeing those different types of\n\n482\n00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:49.540\noperators or\ncharacters that represent certain things.\n\n483\n00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:53.006\nI know from programming we have\nthe double ampersand, and the pipes,\n\n484\n00:26:53.006 --> 00:26:56.077\nthe single pipe,\nthe double pipes that mean and's or or's.\n\n485\n00:26:56.077 --> 00:26:58.565\nI'm sure I'm now speaking your language,\nand you are all like, wait, what?\n\n486\n00:26:58.565 --> 00:27:01.750\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, so that's something that I\n\n487\n00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:04.410\nthink has been helpful to me\nwhenever I see things like this.\n\n488\n00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:06.810\nI actually think how's\nthe data represented?\n\n489\n00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:10.810\nIn general terms, I don't think people,\nthat's at the forefront of your mind until\n\n490\n00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:13.840\nyou run into errors like this\nwhere you have to fix something.\n\n491\n00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:16.310\nI need the cell reference,\nI'm just going to put the wild card.\n\n492\n00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:20.880\nWell actually, you have to tell Excel,\nusing these special characters,\n\n493\n00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:25.600\nit's kind of like you have smoke\nsignals or something like that.\n\n494\n00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:33.100\nHey, I need you to replace this H12 or\nH21 with the value that is in that cell,\n\n495\n00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:39.310\nnot actually the three letters or\nthree alphanumeric characters H 2 1.\n\n496\n00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:43.420\nI don't H21, I want whatever\nis in H21 to be replaced here.\n\n497\n00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:45.820\nSo it is a little bit out there but\n\n498\n00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:50.480\nI definitely can see how sum if helps us\npartition our data, gives us a little more\n\n499\n00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:54.970\nintelligence, especially if we want toys\nand accessories and things of that nature.\n\n500\n00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:57.400\nIt does look like we are running\nlow on time Vaughn but\n\n501\n00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.120\nwe definitely have more Excel\nfunctions coming at you.\n\n502\n00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:03.730\nSo definitely stay tuned, but for now\nwe're going to go ahead and sign off for\n\n503\n00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:05.860\nOffice Pro TV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison,\n\n504\n00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:06.540\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vaughn Smith.\n\n505\n00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:07.660\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you next time.\n\n",

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:17.353\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and\n\n4\n00:00:17.353 --> 00:00:20.610\nin today's episode we're back\nwith more Excel functions.\n\n5\n00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.190\nWell, I guess we're always coming back\nwith more functions in this series.\n\n6\n00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.480\nBut that's just how we roll.\n\n7\n00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.070\nAnd particularly,\nwe're gonna be looking at sumifs,\n\n8\n00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.570\nyes, that's an s at the beginning and\nthe end because, well,\n\n9\n00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.560\nit expands our horizons whenever\nwe need conditional summing.\n\n10\n00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.865\nAnd well, to tell us all about that\nvery thing we have our one and only Ms.\n\n11\n00:00:39.865 --> 00:00:40.400\nVon Smith.\n\n12\n00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.970\nHow are you today, Von?\n\n13\n00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.493\n&gt;&gt; I am so good,\nI don't know what to do with myself.\n\n14\n00:00:44.493 --> 00:00:47.388\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] She's just shaking off camera,\n\n15\n00:00:47.388 --> 00:00:50.504\nit's kind of, it's disturbing and\nexciting at the same time.\n\n16\n00:00:50.504 --> 00:00:53.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, that usually inspires me.\n\n17\n00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.870\nSo [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n18\n00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.680\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, we are gonna be talking about\n\n19\n00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.970\n&gt;&gt; Summing on multiple criterias.\n\n20\n00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.610\nSo this is not necessarily a part two but\n\n21\n00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.320\ndoes correspond very closely\nwith our sum if episode.\n\n22\n00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.830\nSo we're just gonna go ahead and\nthen say, instead of I want a sum\n\n23\n00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.080\nif the category is toys, what if it's\n&gt;&gt; Toys that have a greater\n\n24\n00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.990\nquantity of 10 and\na unit price that's less than 2.\n\n25\n00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.590\nYou can see multiple criteria\nthat we want to go ahead and do.\n\n26\n00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.264\nAnd that's probably something that you\nneed to do in a lot of your organizations\n\n27\n00:01:27.264 --> 00:01:30.977\nis to go ahead and kind of,\nit's like drill down in databases.\n\n28\n00:01:30.977 --> 00:01:35.680\nI want to go all the way down into\nthis particular level of in the store,\n\n29\n00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.145\nwith the sales rep, with this category,\nthose types of things.\n\n30\n00:01:40.145 --> 00:01:42.875\nSo we're going to well do it.\n\n31\n00:01:42.875 --> 00:01:47.030\nLet's jump on down into\nour file called sum ifs.\n\n32\n00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.610\nAn example I have here is I\nwould like to see what the sum\n\n33\n00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.450\ntotal of the category of food\nthat is greater than five.\n\n34\n00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.260\nNow, that's why I went ahead and\nhighlighted these in, or\n\n35\n00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.810\nI guess I should say highlighted.\n\n36\n00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.480\nI changed the font color\njust to kind of show us Yep.\n\n37\n00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.970\nHere's our food and\nthen greater than five.\n\n38\n00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.680\nThat's right here.\n\n39\n00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.870\nSo that would be okay eight, 6, and 10.\n\n40\n00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.430\nI got that and if I look it here,\n\n41\n00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.100\nI know that the sum is going to\nbe 354 based on my status bar.\n\n42\n00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.370\nSo just let's keep that number in mind and\n\n43\n00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.050\nlet's go through the steps\nto get this result.\n\n44\n00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.272\nWe're gonna go through the answer function\ndialog box cuz it's always a great helper.\n\n45\n00:02:32.272 --> 00:02:36.831\nWe're going to find our sum ifs that\nis in my most recently used items,\n\n46\n00:02:36.831 --> 00:02:38.290\nwe click okay.\n\n47\n00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.550\nNow, this is where if you're used to and\nhave done these if,\n\n48\n00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.850\nsingularly, this is reverse.\n\n49\n00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.230\nBefore it's like, let's go ahead and\ndesignate the criteria and\n\n50\n00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.210\nthen based on the criteria tell me what\nthe range of numbers you want to add up.\n\n51\n00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.650\nHere, we tell it what we wanna sum up and\nthen give it the criteria.\n\n52\n00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.510\nBecause if you think about, we have\nmultiple criteria's so it's flipped.\n\n53\n00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.800\nSo just keep that in mind,\nmultiples go and reverse.\n\n54\n00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.160\nLet's just do it and\nfollow the instructions.\n\n55\n00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.290\nThe actual sales to sum,\nthat's what it says.\n\n56\n00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.890\nI would like to have all of\nthese numbers right here.\n\n57\n00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.910\nWhat is the first criteria range?\n\n58\n00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.936\nOkay, these are the ranges cells that you\nwant evaluated for a particular condition.\n\n59\n00:03:28.936 --> 00:03:31.240\nWhat I would like to take, what did I say?\n\n60\n00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.173\nI need the category, so\nlet's select all of them.\n\n61\n00:03:34.173 --> 00:03:38.480\n[LAUGH] And I'll tell you that my little\ntrip up there that happens sometimes is,\n\n62\n00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.290\nI'll stop here.\n\n63\n00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.710\nEspecially if it's sorted, no,\nyou have to give the entire range of your\n\n64\n00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.880\ndata set if you wanna say to\nmake it evaluates everything.\n\n65\n00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.620\nDon't stop In the middle of it and\n\n66\n00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.840\nmake sure we talk about the wrongs in the\nother episode and making sure they add up.\n\n67\n00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:04.490\nSo A1 thru A21 the criteria we'll\nuse the cell reference of food and\n\n68\n00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:10.200\nyou can see that, yep, in that sense\nin that one criteria it's $478.\n\n69\n00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.670\nBut I need another criteria, so\n\n70\n00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.240\nput our cursor into the criteria range\nnumber two and that would be the quantity,\n\n71\n00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:23.280\nmaking sure we're getting\nit from C1 to C21.\n\n72\n00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.890\nAnd then the criteria here would be that\nI would like it to be greater than Five.\n\n73\n00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:30.750\nPerfect.\n\n74\n00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:31.730\nAnd then it goes ahead and\n\n75\n00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.660\nputs the quotations around everything\nthat we need to understand.\n\n76\n00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.260\nWell actually it's just\nyou can cell reference but\n\n77\n00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260\nit's not gonna put it in our formula but\nit is gonna understand that.\n\n78\n00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.120\nAnd the result is 354 and\nthat's exactly it.\n\n79\n00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.530\nNow, just to let you know,\nwell actually let me just stop there.\n\n80\n00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.240\nGetting ahead of myself there.\n\n81\n00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.700\nI'm getting really excited.\n\n82\n00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.312\nBecause that would be two criterias,\nfood and\n\n83\n00:04:54.312 --> 00:04:59.035\nquantity greater than 20, but\nyou can keep adding more and\n\n84\n00:04:59.035 --> 00:05:04.052\nmore criteria that you would want or\nmore if statements in here.\n\n85\n00:05:04.052 --> 00:05:06.235\nI'm gonna start from the beginning again,\n\n86\n00:05:06.235 --> 00:05:10.360\njust again to make sure if we start\ncopying it gets a little weird.\n\n87\n00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.980\nSo, you can add as many as you want.\n\n88\n00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.500\nI'll go a little bit faster this time.\n\n89\n00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.580\nWhat are the numbers I want to add up,\nthat's what I want here.\n\n90\n00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.620\nOops, that's not [LAUGH] that's\ntoo few arguments because you got\n\n91\n00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.110\nexcited again [LAUGH] and\nhit the Enter key.\n\n92\n00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.290\nLet's try that again and\njump back into it.\n\n93\n00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.030\nThere's my range.\n\n94\n00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.950\nThe criteria would be, wait, see.\n\n95\n00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.610\nStop, slow down, take a breath Von, those\nare the numbers that I want to add up.\n\n96\n00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.890\nMy next criteria range\nwould be my category, and\n\n97\n00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.820\nthen mu criteria would be food,\ngood there.\n\n98\n00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.960\nNext range would be quantity, there we go.\n\n99\n00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.010\nCriteria two would be greater than five,\nbut\n\n100\n00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:59.020\nthen I need another criteria and\nthis is where I start get too excited.\n\n101\n00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.540\nWell, I don't have a third criteria, you\njust need to hit t he tap key when you're\n\n102\n00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:09.300\ndone typing in the second\ncriteria after the range.\n\n103\n00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.550\nThe tab will then give you the next set\n\n104\n00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.110\nof ranges that you want to look at for\nyour criteria.\n\n105\n00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.150\nSo just know it's not two only.\n\n106\n00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.150\nYou could have multiple,\nmultiple, multiple.\n\n107\n00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.370\nYou just have to keep\nhitting that tab key.\n\n108\n00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:28.970\nSo then on this one we want the unit\nprice that would be less then 20.\n\n109\n00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.630\nSo we'll come on over here and\nwe go there and\n\n110\n00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:36.580\nwe select that range, hit the Tab key and\n\n111\n00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:42.090\nthen we go with less than 20 and\nthen if we click OK, is that right?\n\n112\n00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:46.820\nSo at the unit price,\nsee that one's 20 and 21, 22.\n\n113\n00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:53.480\nSo these are the only ones that are less\nthan 20 and 100 + 78 is 178, perfect.\n\n114\n00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:59.600\nSo just make sure you allow the insert\nfunction dialogue box to add\n\n115\n00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.040\nthose other fields in for\nyou when you hit the tab key.\n\n116\n00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.720\nSo don't let that trip\nyou up too much in there.\n\n117\n00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.420\n&gt;&gt; And Ron I think I just had an epiphany.\n\n118\n00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.490\nAnd I could be totally off base here, but\n\n119\n00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.820\nif you have any previous\ndatabase experience.\n\n120\n00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.180\nYou made a comment about database.\n\n121\n00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:21.140\nThis is almost how you get select the sum\nwhere, so you get a bunch of where\n\n122\n00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:26.540\nclauses that you can use if you've\nactually done some kind of analysis there.\n\n123\n00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.455\nSo it kind of makes sense why,\nwhat are we getting?\n\n124\n00:07:29.455 --> 00:07:31.295\nAnd then here's all my criteria.\n\n125\n00:07:31.295 --> 00:07:33.575\nBecause all those where\nclauses are then gonna come.\n\n126\n00:07:33.575 --> 00:07:37.575\nSo that more closely mirrors then the sum\nmyth we talked about on the website.\n\n127\n00:07:37.575 --> 00:07:39.575\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we do have an access\nshow that we go ahead and\n\n128\n00:07:39.575 --> 00:07:40.375\ntalked about that side.\n\n129\n00:07:40.375 --> 00:07:42.770\nEventually that's where it's\ngoing to show up, as well.\n\n130\n00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:46.110\nIt's like I'm telling the future or\nthe past or\n\n131\n00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:49.525\nthe present, you don't know and\nI don't know either.\n\n132\n00:07:49.525 --> 00:07:52.417\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly,\ncause it's all relative.\n\n133\n00:07:52.417 --> 00:07:54.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Which is a perfect leading to\n\n134\n00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:58.550\nmy next example of copying.\n\n135\n00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:02.670\nAnd If you're not familiar with absolute\nreferencing, make sure you go back and\n\n136\n00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:07.170\ndefinitely look at the sum if episode and\nthe basic functions to talk about this.\n\n137\n00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:09.510\nBecause this is where if I\nwanted to copy this down and\n\n138\n00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:12.490\nI color coded some things here.\n\n139\n00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:16.640\nIf I look at this, if I click on this cell\nright here and you look up at this formula\n\n140\n00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.390\nbar, you're probably like,\nI am kinda scare at what's going on here.\n\n141\n00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:23.580\nBut let's just jump into it and\ndo the insert function dialogue box.\n\n142\n00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:27.290\nIt's still doing the same thing that\nwe just did in our previous one.\n\n143\n00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:30.650\nWe want to go ahead and\nhave that summing up\n\n144\n00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:33.670\nthis particular criteria range\nwhich would be the category.\n\n145\n00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:39.180\nSo we want in this case, food that\nhas a quantity greater than five.\n\n146\n00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:40.650\nAnd that's wonderful.\n\n147\n00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:45.240\nWhat I did hear though, is I went\nahead and put dollar signs in there.\n\n148\n00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.720\nThe dollar signs mean absolute reference.\n\n149\n00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:53.640\nBecause I'm wanting to pull out\nthe sums of all of these categories,\n\n150\n00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:58.110\nso I'm like, yeah, this is perfect,\nand I'm ready and rocking to go.\n\n151\n00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:02.620\nAnd so you pull this down and\nyou're like, yeah this is great.\n\n152\n00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:04.080\nMan, what, wait.\n\n153\n00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:09.620\nI thought you said absolute arranges and\neverything will be fine.\n\n154\n00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:13.023\nI must have missed a step on purpose.\n\n155\n00:09:13.023 --> 00:09:15.040\n[LAUGH] So, let's look at.\n\n156\n00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.140\nSo Justin, I'm gonna put you on\nthe spot again here, all right?\n\n157\n00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.590\nSo let's look at this.\n\n158\n00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:21.580\nWe've got all of our color coding.\n\n159\n00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.890\nIt's saying,\nall right we're gonna sum this up.\n\n160\n00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:28.860\nOkay, this is our first range,\nthis is the criteria.\n\n161\n00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:35.010\nThis is our next criteria would be, okay,\nlet's look at that, that's that one, okay?\n\n162\n00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:39.250\nSo that would be here,\nthat would be our quantity G4, okay.\n\n163\n00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:44.340\nThat all works out well,\nlet's look at this one Hmm.\n\n164\n00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:45.890\nCan you tell where the problem is?\n\n165\n00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:47.570\n&gt;&gt; Wait a minute, wait a minute.\n\n166\n00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:49.460\nDon't tell me, I'm gonna get this.\n\n167\n00:09:51.276 --> 00:09:52.690\nSo it moved down from quantity.\n\n168\n00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:56.072\nWe actually want to create an absolute\nreference with quantity so\n\n169\n00:09:56.072 --> 00:10:00.600\nwe don't actually go to an empty cell and\nthen the selection gets all jenky.\n\n170\n00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.965\n&gt;&gt; Gold stars all around.\n\n171\n00:10:01.965 --> 00:10:02.920\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n\n172\n00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:03.530\n&gt;&gt; You did it.\n\n173\n00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:04.730\n&gt;&gt; It's like I'm learning.\n\n174\n00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:05.720\nIt's weird.\n\n175\n00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.963\n&gt;&gt; Or reading the show notes.\n\n176\n00:10:06.963 --> 00:10:07.900\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or that, or that.\n\n177\n00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:09.525\nDon't tell them our magic.\n\n178\n00:10:09.525 --> 00:10:12.330\n[SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; Look behind the curtain.\n\n179\n00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:13.080\nThere's the wizard.\n\n180\n00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.350\n&gt;&gt; There's nothing to see here.\n\n181\n00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:19.520\n&gt;&gt; But yes, I did do this on purpose, cuz\nI'm thinking, everything's set up right.\n\n182\n00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:24.200\nYes, you need to make sure you get\nall of the references you need.\n\n183\n00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.080\nSo that was the one that we need.\n\n184\n00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:32.200\nThis particular one which is G6, right?\n\n185\n00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.230\nNo, that's G4.\n\n186\n00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:34.545\nOkay, there we go.\n\n187\n00:10:34.545 --> 00:10:39.150\n[LAUGH] Gotta make sure I\nget the right one in there.\n\n188\n00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.160\nThat's what I want.\n\n189\n00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.050\nAnd if I hit Enter, that's perfect.\n\n190\n00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:47.170\nNow if I pull this down,\nyep, it does work.\n\n191\n00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:51.700\nSo make sure you get all of your\nreferences that you want to\n\n192\n00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.700\nlock down in a sense.\n\n193\n00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:59.155\nSo multiple criterion I wanted to go ahead\nand throw this example in here to kind of\n\n194\n00:10:59.155 --> 00:11:04.980\nre-emphasize that whole concatenating of\nour ranges and how you wanted to do this.\n\n195\n00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:10.190\nAnd this is an example that you probably\nhave in a regular business that I would\n\n196\n00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:16.690\nlike to go ahead and sum up some\nvalues that occur between two dates.\n\n197\n00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:21.420\nSo if I look at this,\nit looks like from January to May\n\n198\n00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:25.830\nthat these are all of some selling dates\nin here and I would really like to see how\n\n199\n00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:30.180\nmuch did we sell from February and March.\n\n200\n00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:35.200\nSo in ahead I made some sell\nreferences out here of February 1st\n\n201\n00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.330\nthrough March 31st.\n\n202\n00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:42.125\nAnything in between that,\nthat would need to be Greater than or\n\n203\n00:11:42.125 --> 00:11:47.924\nequal to cuz we wanna make sure that we\nget that particular sale on that date.\n\n204\n00:11:47.924 --> 00:11:51.359\nAt greater than or\nequal to this particular start date and\n\n205\n00:11:51.359 --> 00:11:55.868\nthen less than or equal to the end date\nbecause even though they're dates,\n\n206\n00:11:55.868 --> 00:11:58.890\nwe know that Excel still\ntreats these as numbers.\n\n207\n00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:02.754\nSo we're really just saying\nGreater than or less than and\n\n208\n00:12:02.754 --> 00:12:04.778\nthen go in between like that.\n\n209\n00:12:04.778 --> 00:12:09.370\n&gt;&gt; It is in a little bit higher like\ncrazy speak, it is a bounded interval.\n\n210\n00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.809\nWe have inclusive interval beginning and\nand\n\n211\n00:12:11.809 --> 00:12:14.703\nend including both ends\nbecause I will forewarn you.\n\n212\n00:12:14.703 --> 00:12:19.102\nI'm not entirely sure about Excel, but\nthere are other data analysis things that\n\n213\n00:12:19.102 --> 00:12:22.110\nyou can do where it includes one end,\nbut not the other.\n\n214\n00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:26.410\nSo leaving out the equal to on the less\nthan or equal to or greater than or\n\n215\n00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:30.890\nequal to, be very, very careful about that\ncuz I'm not saying I've done that but\n\n216\n00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:33.570\nI've done that and\nit messed up some of my calculations.\n\n217\n00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:34.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\n\n218\n00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:36.350\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n219\n00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:40.020\ntype this out, we're going to say\nthis is where I want my result to go.\n\n220\n00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:44.860\nWe're going to go to the insert function\ndialog box, we will say some ifs\n\n221\n00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:49.940\nwhere you want to sum up this range and\nI'm using E1 in there.\n\n222\n00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:52.770\nSo I'm making sure I pull\nmy headings in there,\n\n223\n00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:55.790\nthe first range is we're\nlooking at our dates.\n\n224\n00:12:55.790 --> 00:13:02.870\nSo let's go to A1 through A21, so\nthat's the first criteria range.\n\n225\n00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:09.100\nAnd then the criteria is going to be this\ncell, let's just take it in steps, okay.\n\n226\n00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:13.870\nThen we're going to, I know that\nwe said greater than or equal to.\n\n227\n00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:15.000\nI'm getting there.\n\n228\n00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.470\nThen our next one, it's the same range.\n\n229\n00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:21.060\nSo we're still looking at this range.\n\n230\n00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:26.450\nAnd the end criteria is this cell, okay?\n\n231\n00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:30.990\nWe know that this is going to be wrong\nif we watched our sum if episode.\n\n232\n00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:34.080\nSomething is gonna be a little off.\n\n233\n00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.360\nAnd even if we came into here,\nwhy we're still here.\n\n234\n00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:41.020\nLet's say that we want\nthis to be greater than.\n\n235\n00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:44.400\nSo we need to make sure we put\nthe greater than or equals to.\n\n236\n00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:50.220\nSo just looking at that syntax, that's\nwhat we need to make sure that it has.\n\n237\n00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:54.280\nAnd then on this one we need to\nmake sure that we do a less than.\n\n238\n00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:59.940\nSo that would be less than or\nequal to that particular range as well.\n\n239\n00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.820\nAnd I'm just using the tab key to\nshow you that it is gonna start\n\n240\n00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.650\nputting those quotations\naround everything.\n\n241\n00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:09.040\nBut it's still not working, okay?\n\n242\n00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.830\nWhy is that not working?\n\n243\n00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:17.140\nThis is that back to, it's looking in,\nwhen I put quotations around something,\n\n244\n00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:20.325\nit thinks that everything\nwithin the beginning and\n\n245\n00:14:20.325 --> 00:14:22.905\nthe ending quote is treated as text.\n\n246\n00:14:22.905 --> 00:14:25.345\nSo they're like,\nI don't know what that is.\n\n247\n00:14:25.345 --> 00:14:29.815\nThere's no text that says a greater than\nsymbol and an equal sign and then H6.\n\n248\n00:14:29.815 --> 00:14:33.915\nThis is that mix-mashing of I believe,\nlike you said, the data types.\n\n249\n00:14:33.915 --> 00:14:36.880\nYour strings and your integers and.\n\n250\n00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.451\nWe´re not gonna end up in boolean and\nall of this stuff.\n\n251\n00:14:38.451 --> 00:14:40.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We´re not getting crazy, but\n\n252\n00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:43.290\nI like to think of this as,\ndo you want the label off this box?\n\n253\n00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:47.460\nOr do you want the value inside\nthe box that has the label H6 on it?\n\n254\n00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:51.100\nSo we´re getting a little, it has to\ncome to the forefront of your mind.\n\n255\n00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.510\nIt may not be something that you\nthink about all the time, but\n\n256\n00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:56.308\nin these cases where you´re trying\nto use dynamic cell referencing.\n\n257\n00:14:56.308 --> 00:15:00.066\nYou're probably gonna have to just grit\nyour teeth, let it become ingrained and\n\n258\n00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:01.760\nthen it becomes second nature.\n\n259\n00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:05.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and again, this was that last\nexample that we did in the sum if or\n\n260\n00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:06.760\nyeah in the sum if episode.\n\n261\n00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:11.370\nSo what we need to do is we\nneed to treat this as text and\n\n262\n00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:15.480\nthen concatenate it\ntogether with whatever's in\n\n263\n00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:19.930\nthat box of H6 and\neverything's working there.\n\n264\n00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:22.788\nAnd then we needed, we've gotta get rid of\nthat quote cause' that's wrong, isn't it?\n\n265\n00:15:22.788 --> 00:15:24.810\nYep, cuz that's a cell reference.\n\n266\n00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:28.560\nSo only put the quotes around the thing\nthat you need to treat as text and\n\n267\n00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:29.500\nthen add it into.\n\n268\n00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.470\nSo we need to come over\nhere to do the same thing,\n\n269\n00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:38.140\nclose that, put the ampersand,\nget rid of that particular one.\n\n270\n00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:38.980\nDid I do?\nYep,\n\n271\n00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.790\nthat looks right and\nlet's hit enter and ta-da.\n\n272\n00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:43.220\nThere you go.\n\n273\n00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:48.310\nAnd if we look at this just to kind of\nmake sure I bowled them to double check,\n\n274\n00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:53.410\nyep, down in my status bar\nit says the sum is $696.\n\n275\n00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:57.800\nSo we are rolling and\nwe're cooking with Crisco here.\n\n276\n00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.370\nWe totally got that right.\n\n277\n00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:04.310\nSo just make sure you remember all of\nthose syntax that you can get really from\n\n278\n00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:06.740\nanywhere else besides typing it out.\n\n279\n00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:12.270\nAnd I put this the wrong one back in here\nto just you how it will go ahead and\n\n280\n00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:14.390\npopulate out this way.\n\n281\n00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:18.890\nBut we've gotta make sure we put in those\nquotes and the ampersands to make sure\n\n282\n00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:21.930\nthat everything goes right with\nthose particular criterias.\n\n283\n00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:26.040\nSo just a little example that is like\na real world situation that you're\n\n284\n00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:29.450\nprobably gonna run into and\nnow you have some skills and\n\n285\n00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:33.010\ntools in your toolbox to\nwrite your formulas this way.\n\n286\n00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:36.130\n&gt;&gt; Now, I'm glad you showed us that we\ncan actually apply multiple criterias to\n\n287\n00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:39.540\nthe same criteria range,\nbecause that has a little bit, right?\n\n288\n00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.470\nWe're not filtering on\ndifferent properties,\n\n289\n00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:46.120\nwe're actually filtering on\nan interval For a particular property.\n\n290\n00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.890\nNow, those are typically\nwhat are orderable.\n\n291\n00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:51.220\nWhat I mean is,\nthey have some order, right?\n\n292\n00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:57.070\nLast week was before this week,\nnext week is after so numeric types.\n\n293\n00:16:57.070 --> 00:17:00.970\nIt gets a little weird if you have\ntypes that don't have some kind of\n\n294\n00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:02.740\nordering to them like an intuitive thing.\n\n295\n00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.090\nNow, Von, before we duck outta her,\n\n296\n00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:09.460\ncuz I know we're getting right\nnear the end, one quick question.\n\n297\n00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:14.280\nIs there any difference for using named\nranges with sum ifs versus sum if?\n\n298\n00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:15.280\nOr do those still apply?\n\n299\n00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.400\nYou don't have to show us cuz definitely\ngo check out the sum if episode,\n\n300\n00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:23.280\ncuz we talked a fair amount about name\nranges but can we still use those?\n\n301\n00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.295\n&gt;&gt; You know I love a name range.\n\n302\n00:17:25.295 --> 00:17:26.099\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm like, yes.\n\n303\n00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:28.100\n[LAUGH] Yes you totally can.\n\n304\n00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:29.680\nSo the same rules apply,\n\n305\n00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:33.250\njust really you can use name\nranges anywhere and like you said,\n\n306\n00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:37.070\nI think Bethany other episodes we keep\nreferencing talking about the intervals or\n\n307\n00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:41.480\nbefore and behind and if you look at\nsequence or It's all out the wind.\n\n308\n00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.830\nBut definitely check out that episode.\n\n309\n00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:47.573\nYes, name ranges is making a little bit\nmore logical when you're reading it.\n\n310\n00:17:47.573 --> 00:17:52.136\nSo you're not seeing a bunch of cell\nreferences that don't mean anything to you\n\n311\n00:17:52.136 --> 00:17:53.920\nand can be a little bit easier.\n\n312\n00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:57.860\nRecognize well and the whole absolute\nreferencing automatically in a sense\n\n313\n00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:00.640\nby using the name ranges can\ndefinitely help you out.\n\n314\n00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.690\nSo yep, you are right on the money.\n\n315\n00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:04.362\nYou got more gold stars-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n316\n00:18:04.362 --> 00:18:05.020\n&gt;&gt; To go around there Justin.\n\n317\n00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:06.730\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well I just wanna make sure because\n\n318\n00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:10.750\nI know in the world of applications and\nsoftware, every once in a while and\n\n319\n00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:14.180\nsomething that you think should work\nas it does with everything else.\n\n320\n00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:17.610\nAnd like actually in this time we decided\nto do it a little bit differently so\n\n321\n00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:21.510\nI figure that people love name ranges\nlike I do then I should probably ask.\n\n322\n00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:22.083\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n323\n00:18:22.083 --> 00:18:26.679\nthat's why we're here telling you all\nabout it exact same thing that you do.\n\n324\n00:18:26.679 --> 00:18:28.050\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So Von,\n\n325\n00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:30.900\nthank you so much for\nilluminating some ifs.\n\n326\n00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.020\nAgain an s and an s.\n\n327\n00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:37.127\nBut it does look like we are done with\nthis episode so we're gonna go ahead and\n\n328\n00:18:37.127 --> 00:18:40.609\nskedaddle but we've got more\nExcel functions coming your way.\n\n329\n00:18:40.609 --> 00:18:44.470\nBut for now, signing off for Office Pro\nTV, I've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n330\n00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:45.090\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Von Smith.\n\n331\n00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:46.765\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n332\n00:18:46.765 -->

another exciting\n\n4\n00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:15.655\nepisode of Office Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.655 --> 00:00:17.278\nI'm your host Justin Dennison.\n\n6\n00:00:17.278 --> 00:00:21.168\nAnd in today's episode, well we're\nback with more Excel functions and\n\n7\n00:00:21.168 --> 00:00:23.291\nit just makes me warm and fuzzy inside.\n\n8\n00:00:23.291 --> 00:00:26.740\nParticularly, we're gonna be talking\nabout count, count A and account blank.\n\n9\n00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.806\nI feel like we're on an episode of Sesame\nStreet, but who knows what we'll soon find\n\n10\n00:00:30.806 --> 00:00:34.041\nout, because we have our very own\nExcel maven, Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n11\n00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:35.394\nHow are ya doing today, Vonne?\n\n12\n00:00:35.394 --> 00:00:36.757\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic [LAUGH].\n\n13\n00:00:36.757 --> 00:00:37.781\n&gt;&gt; That is always good to hear.\n\n14\n00:00:37.781 --> 00:00:38.948\n&gt;&gt; It is, and you know what?\n\n15\n00:00:38.948 --> 00:00:41.378\nIt does sound like we're on\nan episode of Sesame Street.\n\n16\n00:00:41.378 --> 00:00:44.250\nWe have one, two, three,\nfunctions [LAUGH].\n\n17\n00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.808\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're talking about today that all\n\n18\n00:00:46.808 --> 00:00:48.387\ninvolve, well, counting.\n\n19\n00:00:48.387 --> 00:00:50.575\nThat's something that\nyou might have to do.\n\n20\n00:00:50.575 --> 00:00:51.521\nI do it a lot.\n\n21\n00:00:51.521 --> 00:00:54.984\nThere were things that I would have\nto do back when I went to university,\n\n22\n00:00:54.984 --> 00:00:57.306\nlike how many students do\nwe have in this class?\n\n23\n00:00:57.306 --> 00:01:00.295\nHow many am I forecasting to be in this?\n\n24\n00:01:00.295 --> 00:01:04.717\nAnd so, I make columns and just put a\nlittle X or something that indicates yep,\n\n25\n00:01:04.717 --> 00:01:05.927\nthat's the person.\n\n26\n00:01:05.927 --> 00:01:07.739\nAnd then, I have to say, all right.\n\n27\n00:01:07.739 --> 00:01:09.803\nNow how many Xs do I\nhave in this one column?\n\n28\n00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:11.930\nAnd that would be counting.\n\n29\n00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.730\nAnd so, there's some different ways that\nwe can go ahead and count, versus on what\n\n30\n00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.270\nthe information that's in the cell,\nis it a number, is it text, is it blank?\n\n31\n00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.769\nWhat I need to count based on\nthat particular means of data.\n\n32\n00:01:24.769 --> 00:01:30.305\nI don't want to say criteria because I\nwanted to say like, what's the criteria.\n\n33\n00:01:30.305 --> 00:01:35.069\nBut I don't want to confuse that with\nsomething else that we'll talk about in\n\n34\n00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:37.359\nanother episode which is a count if.\n\n35\n00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:41.129\nAnd that definitely involves\ncount if it meets a criteria.\n\n36\n00:01:41.129 --> 00:01:45.593\nBut for now in this episode, like I said,\nwe're just gonna do straight up counting,\n\n37\n00:01:45.593 --> 00:01:46.901\nlike regular counting.\n\n38\n00:01:46.901 --> 00:01:51.683\nSo we're gonna go ahead and get started\nwith a file that I have called count.xlxs,\n\n39\n00:01:51.683 --> 00:01:54.022\nor the extension that we have for Excel.\n\n40\n00:01:54.022 --> 00:01:57.144\nBecause I always mess those up,\ncuz it's really hard.\n\n41\n00:01:57.144 --> 00:01:58.092\nX-L-S-X.\n\n42\n00:01:58.092 --> 00:02:00.817\nI have to really slow down, enunciate\nmy words, or my letters, I would say.\n\n43\n00:02:00.817 --> 00:02:05.004\nHey, we're back on\nSesame Street again [LAUGH].\n\n44\n00:02:05.004 --> 00:02:07.313\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know,\nI've learned a new word.\n\n45\n00:02:07.313 --> 00:02:09.411\nExcelsior, I think that's what she said.\n\n46\n00:02:09.411 --> 00:02:10.708\nSo from here on out we're\nworking in Excelsior documents.\n\n47\n00:02:10.708 --> 00:02:16.083\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, it just kind of [SOUND],\nit just blends all together.\n\n48\n00:02:16.083 --> 00:02:20.802\n[LAUGH] All right, so why don't we go into\nthis worksheet to see what we have, and\n\n49\n00:02:20.802 --> 00:02:23.760\nI just kept this small dataset so\nwe can go ahead and\n\n50\n00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.019\nmake sure that we see that\nthis is actually happening.\n\n51\n00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.262\nRight, so the count function,\ndon't know to say it but it counts.\n\n52\n00:02:31.262 --> 00:02:35.076\nYep, that's what it does,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n53\n00:02:35.076 --> 00:02:42.278\nSo if i was going to count the quantity,\nhow many entries do i have in this column?\n\n54\n00:02:42.278 --> 00:02:45.487\nNow as you can see when I\nhighlight a small set like this,\n\n55\n00:02:45.487 --> 00:02:48.643\ndown in the status bar which\nwe've talked about a lot.\n\n56\n00:02:48.643 --> 00:02:51.587\nYou can see I have counted it, it has 14.\n\n57\n00:02:51.587 --> 00:02:55.788\nOkay, great, well that's wonderful\n[LAUGH] but we're gonna go ahead and\n\n58\n00:02:55.788 --> 00:02:59.038\nwrite a formula or\na function I should say, to go ahead and\n\n59\n00:02:59.038 --> 00:03:01.915\nmake sure that that's\nexactly what we are doing.\n\n60\n00:03:01.915 --> 00:03:03.593\nSo why don't we go ahead and\n\n61\n00:03:03.593 --> 00:03:08.272\nclick our cursor into J3 which is the cell\nthat we want to go ahead and count.\n\n62\n00:03:08.272 --> 00:03:09.929\nWe always wanna start there.\n\n63\n00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:13.572\nAnd we know there's quite a few\ndifferent ways to go ahead and\n\n64\n00:03:13.572 --> 00:03:18.434\ninsert different functions, we're gonna\nstart by going into the formula tab,\n\n65\n00:03:18.434 --> 00:03:22.171\ngo into insert function, and\nwe're going to find the count.\n\n66\n00:03:22.171 --> 00:03:24.612\nNow it is in my most recently used items,\nand\n\n67\n00:03:24.612 --> 00:03:29.233\nnow that I just thought about it I'm like\nI don't remember what category it's in.\n\n68\n00:03:29.233 --> 00:03:33.414\nOkay, yes, it is in the statistical\ncategory of functions right there.\n\n69\n00:03:33.414 --> 00:03:36.232\nSo if you wanted to go into\nthat particular book over here,\n\n70\n00:03:36.232 --> 00:03:39.236\nif you wanted to, you're more\nthan welcome to do it that way.\n\n71\n00:03:39.236 --> 00:03:44.011\nBut like I said, I've been using this\nquite a lot in these last couple episodes,\n\n72\n00:03:44.011 --> 00:03:46.199\nor last couple of days, I would say.\n\n73\n00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:48.861\nSo we're gonna go to the most recent\nthing used and we're gonna use count.\n\n74\n00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:52.627\nCount the number of cells in\na range that contains numbers,\n\n75\n00:03:52.627 --> 00:03:55.275\nthat's kind of the key word right there.\n\n76\n00:03:55.275 --> 00:04:00.578\nSo if I click OK, so what is going to be\nmy range of numbers that I'm counting?\n\n77\n00:04:00.578 --> 00:04:05.155\nI come up over to here, and\nI select all of these cells right there.\n\n78\n00:04:05.155 --> 00:04:10.153\nFrom D2 to D15 and you can see\nthat the result is 14, perfect.\n\n79\n00:04:10.153 --> 00:04:12.044\nThat's how many I have.\n\n80\n00:04:12.044 --> 00:04:12.554\nEasy peasy.\n\n81\n00:04:12.554 --> 00:04:14.994\nPretty straightforward on that one.\n\n82\n00:04:14.994 --> 00:04:19.755\nWell, let's go ahead and do some of these\nother columns that I have for counting,\n\n83\n00:04:19.755 --> 00:04:24.519\nand see some different varying results,\nand then explain why that is happening.\n\n84\n00:04:24.519 --> 00:04:27.188\nSo, let's go ahead and\nlet's look at the number of dates.\n\n85\n00:04:27.188 --> 00:04:29.922\nNow I do have a few things in here.\n\n86\n00:04:29.922 --> 00:04:33.123\nLet's just kind of look\nat this information.\n\n87\n00:04:33.123 --> 00:04:34.025\nWe've got some blank.\n\n88\n00:04:34.025 --> 00:04:38.481\nWe have something that says NA like\nNot Applicable for this particular one.\n\n89\n00:04:38.481 --> 00:04:41.784\nWe're going to click our\ncursor here in cell K3.\n\n90\n00:04:41.784 --> 00:04:45.663\nWe will go over to our most recently\nused items which is right here,\n\n91\n00:04:45.663 --> 00:04:46.851\nwe'll stay there.\n\n92\n00:04:46.851 --> 00:04:51.244\nAnd we'll go with count and\nthen I will select that column right here,\n\n93\n00:04:51.244 --> 00:04:55.203\nall of the cells and\nI have A2 through A15, and it says 11.\n\n94\n00:04:55.203 --> 00:04:58.236\nOkay, well, let's try to look at that.\n\n95\n00:04:58.236 --> 00:05:00.952\nIt's not 14, because this is,\nwell, it's blank.\n\n96\n00:05:00.952 --> 00:05:04.717\nThere's no value in there, so\nit's not gonna count that.\n\n97\n00:05:04.717 --> 00:05:09.608\nIt's not gonna count this one, and\nit's not gonna count this one either,\n\n98\n00:05:09.608 --> 00:05:12.493\nbecause this is text,\nthis is not a number.\n\n99\n00:05:12.493 --> 00:05:17.392\nAnd that is specifically why it says the\ncount function will only count numbers,\n\n100\n00:05:17.392 --> 00:05:18.194\nthat's it.\n\n101\n00:05:18.194 --> 00:05:22.104\nFor example,\nyou probably know where I'm going now,\n\n102\n00:05:22.104 --> 00:05:26.354\nif I wanted to count my categories here,\nif I go to here, and\n\n103\n00:05:26.354 --> 00:05:31.728\nthen select all of the categories,\nit's gonna give me a big fat goose egg.\n\n104\n00:05:31.728 --> 00:05:37.121\nCuz it says there's nothing in there\nthat is a number, this is text.\n\n105\n00:05:37.121 --> 00:05:41.733\nSo I can't use the count function if\nthere is anything that involves text.\n\n106\n00:05:41.733 --> 00:05:48.146\nSo I think you can get the idea that\nthe units would be the same thing.\n\n107\n00:05:48.146 --> 00:05:49.563\nLet's just go ahead and\nfinish that one up.\n\n108\n00:05:49.563 --> 00:05:52.482\nJust so we can go ahead and\nsay that we did.\n\n109\n00:05:52.482 --> 00:05:56.700\nOur unit price and then we hit 11 because\nyou can see we do have some blanks.\n\n110\n00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.284\nSo let's move on to the next function\nof how we can count up text.\n\n111\n00:06:00.284 --> 00:06:03.707\n&gt;&gt; Now, before you move on, there's\nsomething a little crazy about this.\n\n112\n00:06:03.707 --> 00:06:07.284\nYou said it's only a number, and\nI'm sure some viewers are like\n\n113\n00:06:07.284 --> 00:06:11.471\n[INAUDIBLE] I mean they had numbers in\nthem but aren't those texts, right?\n\n114\n00:06:11.471 --> 00:06:13.259\nHow do we reconcile that?\n\n115\n00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:16.395\nHow do we think about that?\n\n116\n00:06:16.395 --> 00:06:19.124\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's a really good question and\n\n117\n00:06:19.124 --> 00:06:23.727\nI actually have my note that I was\nsupposed to talk about what a date is,\n\n118\n00:06:23.727 --> 00:06:28.423\ncuz we think of a date as a day but\nin Excel terminology a date is a number.\n\n119\n00:06:28.423 --> 00:06:33.985\nSo it does see that 4/20.2017,\nthat equates to a specific number.\n\n120\n00:06:33.985 --> 00:06:38.646\nAnd that's back when we were doing\nour number formatting, back in\n\n121\n00:06:38.646 --> 00:06:43.909\nExcel Essentials that we said if we\nwant this to a number, it does see that.\n\n122\n00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:47.908\nSo it's almost like a giant look up\ntable of what Excel goes ahead and\n\n123\n00:06:47.908 --> 00:06:52.399\nsees dates as a number type thing and\nif you're like what's a look up table,\n\n124\n00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:55.224\ndon't worry,\nwe have functions on those too.\n\n125\n00:06:55.224 --> 00:06:59.584\nBut that's a really good point and I did\nwanna make that a point but I forgot so\n\n126\n00:06:59.584 --> 00:07:02.188\nI'm so\nglad you're here to keep me in check.\n\n127\n00:07:02.188 --> 00:07:06.347\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think you've actually calmed\nmy fears because from a programmatic\n\n128\n00:07:06.347 --> 00:07:09.337\nstandpoint we don't really\nthink about it this way but\n\n129\n00:07:09.337 --> 00:07:12.074\ndates are always in reference\nto some other date.\n\n130\n00:07:12.074 --> 00:07:15.497\nLike that was three days ago, but our\ncalendar is referenced to some start time.\n\n131\n00:07:15.497 --> 00:07:19.239\nSo all you have to do is give\nthe number of seconds, number of hours,\n\n132\n00:07:19.239 --> 00:07:20.171\nnumber of days.\n\n133\n00:07:20.171 --> 00:07:24.480\nAnd I'm guessing, considering you can\nformat that as a date behind the syntax\n\n134\n00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.527\ncells, probably just using that as\na number and then saying, well,\n\n135\n00:07:28.527 --> 00:07:32.835\nI can do a date lookup and just show the\ndate lookup in a presentational manner to\n\n136\n00:07:32.835 --> 00:07:34.958\nwhere everyone else understands it.\n\n137\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.485\n&gt;&gt; I couldn't have said it better,\nmyself [LAUGH].\n\n138\n00:07:37.485 --> 00:07:41.790\nSo thank you, that is a perfect\nexplanation of how Excel treats dates,\n\n139\n00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:44.216\nand you are very much prepster, so.\n\n140\n00:07:44.216 --> 00:07:45.514\n&gt;&gt; Makes me feel good about myself.\n\n141\n00:07:45.514 --> 00:07:46.939\nI needed that today Vonne, thanks.\n\n142\n00:07:46.939 --> 00:07:49.014\n&gt;&gt; You get, one, two,\nthree stars on that one.\n\n143\n00:07:49.014 --> 00:07:49.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n144\n00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:50.224\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n145\n00:07:50.224 --> 00:07:52.216\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n146\n00:07:52.216 --> 00:07:54.101\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's ahead and\n\n147\n00:07:54.101 --> 00:07:55.703\ngo back to our count A now.\n\n148\n00:07:55.703 --> 00:07:59.986\nAnd A is going to,\nwhen I think of it Count anything, and\n\n149\n00:07:59.986 --> 00:08:03.177\nthat means it could be text, or numbers,\n\n150\n00:08:03.177 --> 00:08:08.118\nit could be either one, so\nthat's one that I wanted to show you.\n\n151\n00:08:08.118 --> 00:08:13.097\nLet's start with a category, so\nI'm on cell, what is this, L4, and\n\n152\n00:08:13.097 --> 00:08:18.424\nthis time I'm going to use this button\nright here and we will go to account A.\n\n153\n00:08:18.424 --> 00:08:22.483\nI don't see it in my most recently used so\njust to remind you that you can always\n\n154\n00:08:22.483 --> 00:08:26.356\ncome up to the search and say, I really\nwanna find where is the count A, and\n\n155\n00:08:26.356 --> 00:08:29.194\nthen if you click go it will go ahead and\nbring that up.\n\n156\n00:08:29.194 --> 00:08:33.884\nAnd even if you had done just C-O-U and\nthen you say search, it will go ahead and\n\n157\n00:08:33.884 --> 00:08:37.051\nbring up any of those functions\nthat start with that.\n\n158\n00:08:37.051 --> 00:08:41.623\nSo just to keep, I'm pretty sure it's\nin the statistical again, but, hey,\n\n159\n00:08:41.623 --> 00:08:45.804\nwhy just go ahead and use the search,\nthat's the easisest way to do it.\n\n160\n00:08:45.804 --> 00:08:48.185\nAnd so the way that they describe is this,\n\n161\n00:08:48.185 --> 00:08:51.329\ncount the number of cells in\na range that are not empty.\n\n162\n00:08:51.329 --> 00:08:55.955\nSo that's another way of saying\nreally just count anything in that\n\n163\n00:08:55.955 --> 00:08:57.369\nparticular range.\n\n164\n00:08:57.369 --> 00:09:02.225\nSo let's come over here and\nselect the category column right there.\n\n165\n00:09:02.225 --> 00:09:05.319\nAnd you can see that yep,\nit does go ahead and\n\n166\n00:09:05.319 --> 00:09:11.440\ncount 14 because it's counting our words\nif you're gonna say not just our numbers.\n\n167\n00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:16.707\nAnd let's come over here to the date just\nto see that there was a mixture in there,\n\n168\n00:09:16.707 --> 00:09:17.256\nright?\n\n169\n00:09:17.256 --> 00:09:21.802\nI have that NA it will count that as well\nso let's go ahead and go back to our\n\n170\n00:09:21.802 --> 00:09:27.271\naccount A, which is right here, and then I\nwill select it, and it should give us 12.\n\n171\n00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:32.085\nExactly, so we can have a mixture of\nnumbers and dates or not dates, or\n\n172\n00:09:32.085 --> 00:09:32.829\nnumbers.\n\n173\n00:09:32.829 --> 00:09:36.275\nNumbers and text,\nthat's what I'm trying to get at.\n\n174\n00:09:36.275 --> 00:09:39.172\nI'll go ahead and\ncount those values right there.\n\n175\n00:09:39.172 --> 00:09:43.638\nBut it will count just straight\nnumbers as well, so if you wanted to.\n\n176\n00:09:43.638 --> 00:09:47.350\nAnd let's go ahead and do another\nvariation of just typing this out,\n\n177\n00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:48.891\nand writing out the count A.\n\n178\n00:09:48.891 --> 00:09:53.719\nWe'll hit the tab key to go ahead and\nthen select the range here, and\n\n179\n00:09:53.719 --> 00:09:54.999\nthen close that.\n\n180\n00:09:54.999 --> 00:09:58.753\nSo it's not gonna give you zero\nif it's looking at numbers.\n\n181\n00:09:58.753 --> 00:10:01.623\nCuz again,\nthat is still any type of value.\n\n182\n00:10:01.623 --> 00:10:06.481\nSo that's something to know about the\ndifferentiation between count and count A.\n\n183\n00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:09.581\nWell, for that count blank.\n\n184\n00:10:09.581 --> 00:10:17.148\nSounds pretty self explanatory, what do\nyou think it's gonna count there, Justin?\n\n185\n00:10:17.148 --> 00:10:21.064\n&gt;&gt; So you have count A as count\nanything that's not blank,\n\n186\n00:10:21.064 --> 00:10:23.408\nthen count blank counts blanks.\n\n187\n00:10:23.408 --> 00:10:26.433\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] One, two, three stars again.\n\n188\n00:10:26.433 --> 00:10:27.909\n&gt;&gt; Man I'm on a role today.\n\n189\n00:10:27.909 --> 00:10:30.472\nI am, I am,\nyou're making me feel good about myself.\n\n190\n00:10:30.472 --> 00:10:32.777\nWe're learning, it's a good day.\n\n191\n00:10:32.777 --> 00:10:33.731\nI'm gonna chop it up.\n\n192\n00:10:33.731 --> 00:10:36.428\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Awesome, so why don't\nwe go ahead and demonstrate this.\n\n193\n00:10:36.428 --> 00:10:41.459\nSo with our dates, if I wanted to\ncount in how many are blank in there.\n\n194\n00:10:41.459 --> 00:10:44.928\nLet's do the fun one of\ntyping this out again.\n\n195\n00:10:44.928 --> 00:10:46.988\nSo I just typed in equals.\n\n196\n00:10:46.988 --> 00:10:50.161\nAnd then I type in the first\ncouple letters of there.\n\n197\n00:10:50.161 --> 00:10:53.795\nAnd you can see I've got a couple\ndifferent count, there's my count blank.\n\n198\n00:10:53.795 --> 00:10:55.893\nLet's go ahead and\nhit the tab key on that,\n\n199\n00:10:55.893 --> 00:10:58.062\ncuz don't hit enter cuz\nI always hit enter.\n\n200\n00:10:58.062 --> 00:11:02.286\nI was just doing this this morning and\nI was just like, don't hit the enter,\n\n201\n00:11:02.286 --> 00:11:03.481\njust hit the tab key.\n\n202\n00:11:03.481 --> 00:11:06.001\nSo just go ahead and\nmake sure you remember that, and\n\n203\n00:11:06.001 --> 00:11:09.803\nnow you could physically type in the range\nbut I like to just use a combination.\n\n204\n00:11:09.803 --> 00:11:14.900\nLet's go ahead and select all of\nthese now her,e and now we hit enter\n\n205\n00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:21.086\nto accept our answer, and then yep, there\nare two blank cells within this range.\n\n206\n00:11:21.086 --> 00:11:24.886\nSo it's doing the exact\nthing it's supposed to do.\n\n207\n00:11:24.886 --> 00:11:29.263\nLet's come over here to the category,\nwell the category we already know,\n\n208\n00:11:29.263 --> 00:11:33.925\nwe can already see that there aren't any\nblanks so we're all right on that one.\n\n209\n00:11:33.925 --> 00:11:37.541\nLet's do the unit, and\nlet's start typing this out again.\n\n210\n00:11:37.541 --> 00:11:42.351\nCount blank tab, we'll go ahead in here.\n\n211\n00:11:42.351 --> 00:11:44.611\nBecause what do you think\nthe answer would be?\n\n212\n00:11:44.611 --> 00:11:46.174\nJust before we start there,\nJustin, you could see.\n\n213\n00:11:46.174 --> 00:11:49.236\n&gt;&gt; So there's 14 total cells and\nthere's three blanks.\n\n214\n00:11:49.236 --> 00:11:51.012\nSo I'm gonna go 11, but.\n\n215\n00:11:51.012 --> 00:11:54.308\n&gt;&gt; Other way,\nremember we're counting blanks.\n\n216\n00:11:54.308 --> 00:11:54.891\n&gt;&gt; See.\n\n217\n00:11:54.891 --> 00:11:59.092\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I threw you for\na loop didn't you.\n\n218\n00:11:59.092 --> 00:12:01.388\n&gt;&gt; I was on such a roll\nwhen I sabotaged myself.\n\n219\n00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:03.540\nSo I'm gonna go with three.\n\n220\n00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:05.038\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n221\n00:12:05.038 --> 00:12:06.069\n&gt;&gt; Well.\n\n222\n00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.848\n&gt;&gt; I was still wrong.\n\n223\n00:12:06.848 --> 00:12:08.123\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You set me up.\n\n224\n00:12:08.123 --> 00:12:08.740\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n\n225\n00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That was a double setup,\n\n226\n00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.138\nI'm sorry [LAUGH].\n\n227\n00:12:11.138 --> 00:12:13.552\nWell, okay but\nI would have said three too.\n\n228\n00:12:13.552 --> 00:12:15.363\nSo but I did this on purpose.\n\n229\n00:12:15.363 --> 00:12:19.869\nLearning experience, so the thing is,\nit says that it is blank but\n\n230\n00:12:19.869 --> 00:12:21.401\nwe think it's blank.\n\n231\n00:12:21.401 --> 00:12:24.567\nBut this is where it's not really blank.\n\n232\n00:12:24.567 --> 00:12:27.460\nThat's that kind of fake blank,\nif you wanna say.\n\n233\n00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:32.637\nBut I click here, all right, well, this is\ncell C2, but I don't see anything here.\n\n234\n00:12:32.637 --> 00:12:37.509\nBut if I click in there and\ndouble click I don't know if you can see,\n\n235\n00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:39.863\nbut where ever my cursor lands?\n\n236\n00:12:39.863 --> 00:12:42.638\nThere's actually a space.\n\n237\n00:12:42.638 --> 00:12:47.989\n&gt;&gt; White space character they do count as\ncharacters even if you can't see them.\n\n238\n00:12:47.989 --> 00:12:52.171\n&gt;&gt; Yes the non printing characters,\nif I backspace out of there and\n\n239\n00:12:52.171 --> 00:12:53.651\nthen click over here.\n\n240\n00:12:53.651 --> 00:12:55.865\nNotice that our number\nturns to one over here.\n\n241\n00:12:55.865 --> 00:13:01.874\nBut I come into here, hit the spacebar,\nand then click out, it goes to one.\n\n242\n00:13:01.874 --> 00:13:06.830\nSo this is one of those make sure,\nI can't tell you how many times that\n\n243\n00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:11.968\nnon-printing characters,\nthe non-breaking space that we call it.\n\n244\n00:13:11.968 --> 00:13:14.568\nThat will mess you up.\n\n245\n00:13:14.568 --> 00:13:16.327\nEspecially if you're trying to do,\n\n246\n00:13:16.327 --> 00:13:19.062\nin another episode we're\ngonna be doing the count, if.\n\n247\n00:13:19.062 --> 00:13:22.998\nAnd if you have Gainesville, and\nyou're trying to match that criteria but\n\n248\n00:13:22.998 --> 00:13:25.384\nyou have Gainesville\nwith a space at the end?\n\n249\n00:13:25.384 --> 00:13:29.827\nIt's gonna return that there's nothing\nmatching because of that space.\n\n250\n00:13:29.827 --> 00:13:31.545\nIt can really, really trip you up.\n\n251\n00:13:31.545 --> 00:13:36.503\nSo just be very careful about looking at\nthis and making sure blanks are really\n\n252\n00:13:36.503 --> 00:13:40.028\nblank and that there's not\nthat kind of hidden space.\n\n253\n00:13:40.028 --> 00:13:42.773\nIt's kind of a lurking\nlittle thing right there.\n\n254\n00:13:42.773 --> 00:13:47.086\n&gt;&gt; And I will forewarn you from\na figuring out what's wrong\n\n255\n00:13:47.086 --> 00:13:51.124\nperspective Those errors,\nI mean they are errors,\n\n256\n00:13:51.124 --> 00:13:56.018\nthey give you unexpected output,\nbased on what you expected.\n\n257\n00:13:56.018 --> 00:13:59.750\nThey're really hard to track down,\ncuz you're like, what there's three,\n\n258\n00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:01.511\nthis says zero, that's not right.\n\n259\n00:14:01.511 --> 00:14:05.725\nAnd where this can really come in is\nif you have a formula where you need to\n\n260\n00:14:05.725 --> 00:14:09.320\ndivide by the number of blank spaces or\nsomething like that.\n\n261\n00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:13.593\nI'm having a hard time coming up with\nconcrete examples at this current time.\n\n262\n00:14:13.593 --> 00:14:17.784\nBut that zero, boom, all your calculations\nblow up and you get weirdness so\n\n263\n00:14:17.784 --> 00:14:19.432\nthey're hard to track down.\n\n264\n00:14:19.432 --> 00:14:22.341\nSo it's easier to be really careful up\nfront instead of trying to back track and\n\n265\n00:14:22.341 --> 00:14:23.409\nfigure out what went wrong.\n\n266\n00:14:23.409 --> 00:14:28.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I think you're talking about if\nyou have some type of nested formula or\n\n267\n00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:32.603\nfunctions that it's all depending on,\nit's tripped me up a lot.\n\n268\n00:14:32.603 --> 00:14:34.285\nEven going through some of these examples.\n\n269\n00:14:34.285 --> 00:14:36.796\nAnd the reason why I said that\nGainesville one, is because I did that.\n\n270\n00:14:36.796 --> 00:14:39.828\nI typed it in with a space and\nI was just like, my gosh.\n\n271\n00:14:39.828 --> 00:14:42.660\nAnd it took me a good\n15 minutes of kind of,\n\n272\n00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:46.196\nit's not a very complex formula and\nit took me awhile.\n\n273\n00:14:46.196 --> 00:14:49.313\nSo just be aware of it, and\nthat's why I really wanna emphasize it.\n\n274\n00:14:49.313 --> 00:14:53.749\nYou have to make sure that your data that\nyou're actually trying to analyze is\n\n275\n00:14:53.749 --> 00:14:54.370\ncorrect.\n\n276\n00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:57.041\nCuz these functions will do\nexactly what you tell it.\n\n277\n00:14:57.041 --> 00:14:59.136\nIt's like,\nI'm giving you exactly what you want.\n\n278\n00:14:59.136 --> 00:15:00.615\nIt's like, no, you're not.\n\n279\n00:15:00.615 --> 00:15:05.334\nThere's that kind of lurking error.\n\n280\n00:15:05.334 --> 00:15:08.205\nThat's not gonna give you\nan actual error report, so.\n\n281\n00:15:08.205 --> 00:15:10.206\nAll right, so\nthat's what we've got going on.\n\n282\n00:15:10.206 --> 00:15:13.893\nJust to show you now this is\nanother example of a blank cell.\n\n283\n00:15:13.893 --> 00:15:17.477\nIt's just to where you might have,\nnotice here, in this particular cell,\n\n284\n00:15:17.477 --> 00:15:21.297\nit has equals, and then an open quote,\nand then a space, and then a close quote.\n\n285\n00:15:21.297 --> 00:15:25.021\nSo it's just kinda like\nthis empty formula,\n\n286\n00:15:25.021 --> 00:15:29.924\nif you wanna say,\njust kind of putting out an actual space.\n\n287\n00:15:29.924 --> 00:15:34.478\nSo if I got those particular cells,\nand really blanked them out for\n\n288\n00:15:34.478 --> 00:15:37.565\nreal, then it is doing\nexactly what it says,\n\n289\n00:15:37.565 --> 00:15:41.733\nthat there are three blanks in\nthat particular unit column.\n\n290\n00:15:41.733 --> 00:15:45.670\nSo it does work, it is true,\nyou just have to know.\n\n291\n00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:48.955\nSo those are some of our basic counting.\n\n292\n00:15:48.955 --> 00:15:52.568\nAnd just to kind of throw\nanother example out of this,\n\n293\n00:15:52.568 --> 00:15:57.808\nthis is something that I would actually\ndo In my job, almost daily in a sense.\n\n294\n00:15:57.808 --> 00:15:58.568\nWell, daily,\n\n295\n00:15:58.568 --> 00:16:02.317\ndepending on the time of the semester\nof when we're actually doing, like.\n\n296\n00:16:02.317 --> 00:16:04.297\nPre-enrollment and everything like that.\n\n297\n00:16:04.297 --> 00:16:08.214\nSo, I have, for example,\na list of students, okay?\n\n298\n00:16:08.214 --> 00:16:10.127\nAnd then, I have attendance.\n\n299\n00:16:10.127 --> 00:16:15.412\nOkay, so maybe, this is a teacher's\nattendance book as to well, I\n\n300\n00:16:15.412 --> 00:16:21.650\nwant to go ahead and tell me how many days\nabsent each one of these students have.\n\n301\n00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:23.424\nSo, well then, that would be perfect.\n\n302\n00:16:23.424 --> 00:16:28.388\nIf I wanna take how many absences,\nthat would mean there would have to be\n\n303\n00:16:28.388 --> 00:16:32.719\nno X in that particular field,\nthat's a well, count blank.\n\n304\n00:16:32.719 --> 00:16:35.277\nIf it is blank, well then,\nthat's what I want you to count.\n\n305\n00:16:35.277 --> 00:16:39.850\nSo let's go ahead and start typing\nthat out, and I'm going to say,\n\n306\n00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:42.995\nequals and then use my helper,\nuse my tab key.\n\n307\n00:16:42.995 --> 00:16:45.265\nSelect the range of our first student.\n\n308\n00:16:45.265 --> 00:16:49.585\nThen go ahead and hit Enter, and you can\nsee that Rose had perfect attendance for\n\n309\n00:16:49.585 --> 00:16:50.241\nthis week.\n\n310\n00:16:50.241 --> 00:16:51.455\nGood job, Rose.\n\n311\n00:16:51.455 --> 00:16:56.078\nNow this is where using our copying down\nof our function would work really well,\n\n312\n00:16:56.078 --> 00:16:57.942\nusing our relative reference.\n\n313\n00:16:57.942 --> 00:17:01.091\nBecause now, I wanna go ahead and do the\nsame thing for all of our students, and\n\n314\n00:17:01.091 --> 00:17:03.643\nwe've talked about in some other episodes,\nsome shortcuts.\n\n315\n00:17:03.643 --> 00:17:06.967\nMy favorite is just take the fill hand,\nor the black plus sign,\n\n316\n00:17:06.967 --> 00:17:08.361\nand just double click it.\n\n317\n00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:11.304\nAnd when you double click it, it will go\nahead and fill down all the way across.\n\n318\n00:17:11.304 --> 00:17:14.489\nYou're like, yes, this is perfect,\nthis is doing so good.\n\n319\n00:17:14.489 --> 00:17:17.553\nAnd I can see that yep,\nthose are all the blanks, and\n\n320\n00:17:17.553 --> 00:17:20.142\nwe are all okay with\nthe number of absences.\n\n321\n00:17:20.142 --> 00:17:21.403\nAnd it looks like, you know what?\n\n322\n00:17:21.403 --> 00:17:26.644\nMona, hey, you've been out of class\nthree days this week, not so good.\n\n323\n00:17:26.644 --> 00:17:28.944\nSo that, we can go ahead and\nuse our count.\n\n324\n00:17:28.944 --> 00:17:31.564\nWell then, the other thing you\nmight need to calculate would be,\n\n325\n00:17:31.564 --> 00:17:33.435\nwe're not gonna say calculate,\nI say count.\n\n326\n00:17:33.435 --> 00:17:37.240\nWell then,\nwhat was our attendance for each day?\n\n327\n00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:41.390\nSo let's go ahead and count,\nif there is an X in here,\n\n328\n00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:43.711\nthen go ahead and count that.\n\n329\n00:17:43.711 --> 00:17:48.632\nNow X is not a number, okay so\nI wouldn't use the calc function,\n\n330\n00:17:48.632 --> 00:17:50.466\nI would use the count A.\n\n331\n00:17:50.466 --> 00:17:53.994\nBut I will show you a little\ntrick that I normally do.\n\n332\n00:17:53.994 --> 00:17:59.936\nBecause I do love the auto sum, or\nthe auto functions that are in there.\n\n333\n00:17:59.936 --> 00:18:03.921\nAnd I'm not calculating,I'm not\nadding the drop down next to it.\n\n334\n00:18:03.921 --> 00:18:07.578\nI can go ahead and\ndo a average count numbers, no, wait,\n\n335\n00:18:07.578 --> 00:18:12.246\nyou just said do a count A, I know, but\njust roll with me for a little bit.\n\n336\n00:18:12.246 --> 00:18:16.684\nSo, I'm just gonna go ahead and\ndo the count numbers, and then,\n\n337\n00:18:16.684 --> 00:18:18.713\nselect my cells, hit Enter.\n\n338\n00:18:18.713 --> 00:18:21.627\nAnd it's gonna give me a zero,\nI know it's gonna give me a zero.\n\n339\n00:18:21.627 --> 00:18:25.148\nI just come back into here, and\nthen, come up to my formula bar and\n\n340\n00:18:25.148 --> 00:18:26.572\nput the letter a in there.\n\n341\n00:18:26.572 --> 00:18:30.454\nEven if it was lowercase, cuz I know\nthat's the function I really want.\n\n342\n00:18:30.454 --> 00:18:33.317\nThen hit Enter, and\nthen it goes ahead and changes it.\n\n343\n00:18:33.317 --> 00:18:36.800\nSo sometimes,\nthat's just the way I've always done it,\n\n344\n00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.725\njust cuz I'm obsessed\nwith the auto functions.\n\n345\n00:18:39.725 --> 00:18:43.559\n[LAUGH] And then, of course, we wanna use\nthat relative reference to pull across or,\n\n346\n00:18:43.559 --> 00:18:45.345\nin this sense, let's do another one.\n\n347\n00:18:45.345 --> 00:18:51.192\nLet's do the Select All the cells, and\ndo a Ctrl+R, which would be for the right.\n\n348\n00:18:51.192 --> 00:18:53.961\nWe did the Ctrl+D when\nwe were filling down.\n\n349\n00:18:53.961 --> 00:18:58.666\nAnd it will copy over using that\nrelative reference to now count the C,\n\n350\n00:18:58.666 --> 00:18:59.636\nthe E, and F.\n\n351\n00:18:59.636 --> 00:19:04.244\nAnd so,\nwe can see that we had perfect attendance.\n\n352\n00:19:04.244 --> 00:19:07.049\nNow I just looked at this,\nwhy is that working there?\n\n353\n00:19:07.049 --> 00:19:08.063\nIs that a blank?\n\n354\n00:19:08.063 --> 00:19:11.507\nOkay, nope that's what,\nno wait, we have 17 students.\n\n355\n00:19:11.507 --> 00:19:12.491\nThat's why [LAUGH].\n\n356\n00:19:12.491 --> 00:19:17.651\nNevermind, okay, I just forgot [LAUGH] how\nmany total students I have in my class.\n\n357\n00:19:17.651 --> 00:19:19.425\nWhich, you know,\nI guess that happens sometimes.\n\n358\n00:19:19.425 --> 00:19:21.102\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know names,\n\n359\n00:19:21.102 --> 00:19:22.708\nyou know how to interact with people.\n\n360\n00:19:22.708 --> 00:19:24.318\nSometimes, whoopsy, daisy.\n\n361\n00:19:24.318 --> 00:19:25.696\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, but Vonne,\n\n362\n00:19:25.696 --> 00:19:26.467\nI do see something here.\n\n363\n00:19:26.467 --> 00:19:30.883\nThis is great, and being an instructor\nmyself in a previous life.\n\n364\n00:19:30.883 --> 00:19:33.424\nThere are times you need\nto keep attendance.\n\n365\n00:19:33.424 --> 00:19:39.578\nMy concern about this is, what if you do\nhave a blank that is, maybe it's a space?\n\n366\n00:19:39.578 --> 00:19:42.712\nWhoops, I hit a space, then enter,\nas I was going down the column, or\n\n367\n00:19:42.712 --> 00:19:44.108\nsomething like that, right.\n\n368\n00:19:44.108 --> 00:19:48.679\nI'm taking role, hit a space, oops, but\nnow that would actually be counted, right?\n\n369\n00:19:48.679 --> 00:19:49.868\nDo I have that wrong?\n\n370\n00:19:49.868 --> 00:19:53.708\n&gt;&gt; You are correct, unless Ashley,\nlook at Tina right here.\n\n371\n00:19:53.708 --> 00:19:56.836\nOkay, Tina,\nit says that she wasn't absent any day.\n\n372\n00:19:56.836 --> 00:20:02.672\nWell, if we look, yup,\nthere's that lurking space in that cell.\n\n373\n00:20:02.672 --> 00:20:05.981\nIf I come into here and double click,\nyup, there's that space,\n\n374\n00:20:05.981 --> 00:20:07.613\nand so you do have to be careful.\n\n375\n00:20:07.613 --> 00:20:12.479\nThere actually is a function\nthat will remove spaces,\n\n376\n00:20:12.479 --> 00:20:15.986\nso that's, I believe it's the trim?\n\n377\n00:20:15.986 --> 00:20:17.882\nYeah-\n&gt;&gt; That sounds right,\n\n378\n00:20:17.882 --> 00:20:21.894\nbased on my limited experience\ncomparatively, that does sound right.\n\n379\n00:20:21.894 --> 00:20:25.395\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we will have an episode\non that, and I will just be like yep.\n\n380\n00:20:25.395 --> 00:20:30.370\nIt's almost, the 100, well,\n99.9% sure it is trim.\n\n381\n00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:32.814\nBut yeah, that way you could go ahead,\nand get those white spaces off, so\n\n382\n00:20:32.814 --> 00:20:34.446\nthat might be something\nthat you might wanna do.\n\n383\n00:20:34.446 --> 00:20:37.234\nThe other thing you could\nalways do is do a find.\n\n384\n00:20:37.234 --> 00:20:41.265\nIf you know within this particular\ndataset, if you go ahead and\n\n385\n00:20:41.265 --> 00:20:42.720\njust say find a space.\n\n386\n00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.561\nAnd then it will go ahead and\ngive you those results,\n\n387\n00:20:45.561 --> 00:20:47.444\nthat would be another way to do it.\n\n388\n00:20:47.444 --> 00:20:50.199\nSo let's go ahead and actually,\nyou know, let's do that.\n\n389\n00:20:50.199 --> 00:20:54.015\nSo if I do a find, and I just,\nwhoops that is the wrong one.\n\n390\n00:20:54.015 --> 00:20:58.910\n[LAUGH] So we come over here to find,\nand I'll do the find here, and\n\n391\n00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:03.810\nthen I could say find what, and\nI just actually hit the space bar.\n\n392\n00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:07.979\nAnd then I find all, notice it will\ngo ahead and give me, well now,\n\n393\n00:21:07.979 --> 00:21:10.370\nthere's quite a few of them in there.\n\n394\n00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:16.638\nCuz see, we have rows and we have\nthe Tina, so that is finding a space.\n\n395\n00:21:16.638 --> 00:21:20.668\nSo that's something that you would\nprobably wanna make sure that right there\n\n396\n00:21:20.668 --> 00:21:22.222\nmatch entire cell contents.\n\n397\n00:21:22.222 --> 00:21:26.862\nTo make sure that, I don't want you\nto have a space that's in a name,\n\n398\n00:21:26.862 --> 00:21:28.712\nif I then find all of those.\n\n399\n00:21:28.712 --> 00:21:32.383\nThat's where, in this particular example,\nit will go ahead and\n\n400\n00:21:32.383 --> 00:21:34.866\nfind, there's that one right there.\n\n401\n00:21:34.866 --> 00:21:37.276\nSo, and\nthen there's that one right there, yep.\n\n402\n00:21:37.276 --> 00:21:39.792\nThose are the ones that have a blank.\n\n403\n00:21:39.792 --> 00:21:42.815\nAnd so,\nif you just replace it with nothing,\n\n404\n00:21:42.815 --> 00:21:47.603\nthen it will go ahead, if you replace it,\nwell at least you can find it.\n\n405\n00:21:47.603 --> 00:21:51.545\nSo I'm not sure if you can\nreplace it with nothing,\n\n406\n00:21:51.545 --> 00:21:56.234\nlike remove the space, but\nat least it will find them for me.\n\n407\n00:21:56.234 --> 00:22:00.102\nAnd now you've got me, I'm like, can I do,\nwell, I guess that's where you would\n\n408\n00:22:00.102 --> 00:22:02.552\ngo ahead and\nuse the function to go ahead and do that.\n\n409\n00:22:02.552 --> 00:22:05.701\nSo, at least I know where they are,\ncome into here, and\n\n410\n00:22:05.701 --> 00:22:07.921\nthen I could make sure I space them out.\n\n411\n00:22:07.921 --> 00:22:09.509\nAnd then, there we go.\n\n412\n00:22:09.509 --> 00:22:13.245\nAnd now, Tina should have\nthe correct number of absences.\n\n413\n00:22:13.245 --> 00:22:18.311\nSo this is just one of the ways that\nwe could go ahead and find our blanks.\n\n414\n00:22:18.311 --> 00:22:21.242\nSo, I guess our non-blanks, right.\n\n415\n00:22:21.242 --> 00:22:22.573\n[LAUGH] That's what were doing.\n\n416\n00:22:22.573 --> 00:22:24.139\nAnd now I've got myself a little confused.\n\n417\n00:22:24.139 --> 00:22:25.619\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There are all kind of entities\n\n418\n00:22:25.619 --> 00:22:28.868\nto count, and we have a difficult time,\nsometimes keeping those straight.\n\n419\n00:22:28.868 --> 00:22:30.083\nWe are not infallible.\n\n420\n00:22:30.083 --> 00:22:32.850\nHowever Vonne,\nI can see the depth in utility in this.\n\n421\n00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:36.584\nI'm thinking from a more Math,\nI'm like okay, I can count this,\n\n422\n00:22:36.584 --> 00:22:40.999\npartition data set, but I need to show\na useful example, so thank you so much.\n\n423\n00:22:40.999 --> 00:22:46.042\nWe are finished with Count A and\nCount Blank, am I right, Vonne?\n\n424\n00:22:46.042 --> 00:22:49.208\n&gt;&gt; You know Justin,\nyou must have read my mind.\n\n425\n00:22:49.208 --> 00:22:53.082\nOr rather just show notes, [LAUGH] because\nthat is exactly what I did in this\n\n426\n00:22:53.082 --> 00:22:55.091\nexample, and I want to show you here.\n\n427\n00:22:55.091 --> 00:22:57.579\nSo why don't we look at Tina right here.\n\n428\n00:22:57.579 --> 00:23:01.528\nSo Tina Chandler, it says that\nshe's been absent for zero days.\n\n429\n00:23:01.528 --> 00:23:05.764\nBut I look in there, and like,\nwell, yep, it's that dreaded,\n\n430\n00:23:05.764 --> 00:23:09.093\nlurking space that I have\nin this particular cell.\n\n431\n00:23:09.093 --> 00:23:12.065\nSo this is one of those like well,\nI wanted to be accurate, especially,\n\n432\n00:23:12.065 --> 00:23:13.694\nif you are teacher taking attendance.\n\n433\n00:23:13.694 --> 00:23:17.724\nSo, what if I wanted to say hey, can\nwe just get rid of all of those blanks?\n\n434\n00:23:17.724 --> 00:23:18.982\nWell, you can.\n\n435\n00:23:18.982 --> 00:23:22.602\nYou can use the Find &amp; Replace,\nwhich would be super, super handy.\n\n436\n00:23:22.602 --> 00:23:25.752\nSo while we're on our Home tab,\ncome over here to our Find.\n\n437\n00:23:25.752 --> 00:23:27.936\nAnd we'll just go straight to Replace,\n\n438\n00:23:27.936 --> 00:23:30.450\nbecause that brings up\nboth of them together.\n\n439\n00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:32.691\nSo we are going to find what?\n\n440\n00:23:32.691 --> 00:23:36.800\nNow, I'm just gonna take my space\nbar here, and just hit the Space.\n\n441\n00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:40.338\nAnd that's what I wanna find, and so\nlet's go ahead and look at the Find All,\n\n442\n00:23:40.338 --> 00:23:42.580\nand see our report of what\nit's going to give us.\n\n443\n00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:46.668\nBut the thing is like, wow,\nit's giving us a lot in there, isn't it?\n\n444\n00:23:46.668 --> 00:23:50.497\nOkay, so it's giving me the ones\nwith Rose, well of course.\n\n445\n00:23:50.497 --> 00:23:54.910\nIt's looking for a space, and there\nis a space between Rose and Mitchell,\n\n446\n00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:56.604\nthe first and the last name.\n\n447\n00:23:56.604 --> 00:23:59.872\nSo, that's not what I want to look for\nhere.\n\n448\n00:23:59.872 --> 00:24:03.824\nAnd that's where you just need to make\nsure that you have the check box right\n\n449\n00:24:03.824 --> 00:24:06.911\nthere, where we want it to\nmatch the entire cell content.\n\n450\n00:24:06.911 --> 00:24:08.907\nThat's what I'm looking for.\n\n451\n00:24:08.907 --> 00:24:12.262\nSo let's look at that again, and\nwe find yep, that's where it is.\n\n452\n00:24:12.262 --> 00:24:16.976\nIf I look, there's that C3 and\nE3, so I've got those.\n\n453\n00:24:16.976 --> 00:24:20.960\nI can see that my whole\ncell has a space in it.\n\n454\n00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.566\nSo, well, I wanna get rid of it.\n\n455\n00:24:23.566 --> 00:24:26.342\nWell, it's almost too simple.\n\n456\n00:24:26.342 --> 00:24:27.898\nWe'll just replace it with what?\n\n457\n00:24:27.898 --> 00:24:28.658\nReplace it with blank.\n\n458\n00:24:28.658 --> 00:24:31.095\nWell, not actually blank, nothing.\n\n459\n00:24:31.095 --> 00:24:32.112\nWell, I guess blank is nothing.\n\n460\n00:24:32.112 --> 00:24:34.787\nOkay [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It gets a little weird when you start\n\n461\n00:24:34.787 --> 00:24:37.391\ntalking about data types,\ninstead of a computer,\n\n462\n00:24:37.391 --> 00:24:39.284\nbecause a blank space is something.\n\n463\n00:24:39.284 --> 00:24:43.186\nIt is a blank space,\nnothing is the absence of said thing.\n\n464\n00:24:43.186 --> 00:24:44.747\n&gt;&gt; So is that the null, right?\n\n465\n00:24:44.747 --> 00:24:45.357\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n466\n00:24:45.357 --> 00:24:46.722\n&gt;&gt; Is null or not null or?\n\n467\n00:24:46.722 --> 00:24:48.292\n&gt;&gt; I feel like we're getting\ninto a metaphysics discussion.\n\n468\n00:24:48.292 --> 00:24:49.136\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n469\n00:24:49.136 --> 00:24:51.962\nmaybe we shouldn't have show everyone\nexactly what we're talking about.\n\n470\n00:24:51.962 --> 00:24:54.476\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right?\nSo I have in there find, there is a space.\n\n471\n00:24:54.476 --> 00:24:57.490\nAnd you can see my cursor does\nmove a little bit to the right.\n\n472\n00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:00.219\nReplace with,\nmy cursor's just in there, and\n\n473\n00:25:00.219 --> 00:25:03.300\nif I go ahead and replace all,\nyup, we're all done.\n\n474\n00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:04.665\nWe've made our two replacements.\n\n475\n00:25:04.665 --> 00:25:05.732\nYou click OK.\n\n476\n00:25:05.732 --> 00:25:07.352\nThis is where it can\nkind of get confusing.\n\n477\n00:25:07.352 --> 00:25:09.932\nWell wait, it's still in there, right?\n\n478\n00:25:09.932 --> 00:25:12.815\nNo, if I did a find all again,\nthere's nothing in there.\n\n479\n00:25:12.815 --> 00:25:15.532\nBecause remember,\nmy search criteria was find in space.\n\n480\n00:25:15.532 --> 00:25:19.231\nWe can't find a space in a,\nthe whole contents of the cell, so that's\n\n481\n00:25:19.231 --> 00:25:23.892\nwhere we're like yeah, it totally did what\nit was supposed to, what I asked it do.\n\n482\n00:25:23.892 --> 00:25:29.388\nAnd then look at our results, yup,\nTina did, actually had two absences,\n\n483\n00:25:29.388 --> 00:25:33.065\nbecause now it's counting\na full blank in there.\n\n484\n00:25:33.065 --> 00:25:36.022\nSo that's something really easy,\nif you're gonna go ahead and\n\n485\n00:25:36.022 --> 00:25:37.674\nuse the whole contents of the cell.\n\n486\n00:25:37.674 --> 00:25:40.028\nFor this particular example it's, well,\n\n487\n00:25:40.028 --> 00:25:44.428\na great example of where to use the find\nreplace, so I'm very glad you asked that.\n\n488\n00:25:44.428 --> 00:25:47.863\nAnd you're reading my show notes, and\njust like always, keeping me on track.\n\n489\n00:25:47.863 --> 00:25:51.176\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, Vonne, that is definitely\na time that I've struggled with.\n\n490\n00:25:51.176 --> 00:25:53.288\nAnd I'm glad you showed me\nthat finer replace trip,\n\n491\n00:25:53.288 --> 00:25:56.705\nbecause if you're using count blank, it\ncan definitely come in handy, especially\n\n492\n00:25:56.705 --> 00:25:57.245\n&gt;&gt; You're like,\n\n493\n00:25:57.245 --> 00:25:58.535\nwell these are unexpected results.\n\n494\n00:25:58.535 --> 00:26:01.445\nSo thank you so much,\nnow we have count, count a, and\n\n495\n00:26:01.445 --> 00:26:04.497\ncount blank,\nare we finished with these set of counts?\n\n496\n00:26:04.497 --> 00:26:05.797\n&gt;&gt; We are for these ones, and\n\n497\n00:26:05.797 --> 00:26:09.298\nthen we're gonna have some more with\nsome criteria for the countifs.\n\n498\n00:26:09.298 --> 00:26:11.039\nAnd that gets super fun.\n\n499\n00:26:11.039 --> 00:26:12.241\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne, thanks for\nshowing me that trick.\n\n500\n00:26:12.241 --> 00:26:15.721\nThat is something that is definitely\nin place on my Excel spreadsheets from\n\n501\n00:26:15.721 --> 00:26:16.395\ntime to time.\n\n502\n00:26:16.395 --> 00:26:19.951\nSo find and\nreplace gonna be a handy tool for me.\n\n503\n00:26:19.951 --> 00:26:23.111\nBut it does look like we're running\nout of time for this episode, but\n\n504\n00:26:23.111 --> 00:26:25.247\nwe have more Excel\nfunctions coming your way.\n\n505\n00:26:25.247 --> 00:26:28.222\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for OfficePro.TV.\n\n506\n00:26:28.222 --> 00:26:29.529\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n507\n00:26:29.529 --> 00:26:30.208\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n508\n00:26:30.208 --> 00:26:31.027\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n509\n00:26:31.027 --> 00:26:34.742\n[SOUND]\n\n",

OFFICEPRO.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.494 --> 00:00:16.756\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n4\n00:00:16.756 --> 00:00:19.293\nAnd in today's episode, we're back\nwith more Excel functions, and well,\n\n5\n00:00:19.293 --> 00:00:21.060\nwe're gonna be counting with countif and\ncountifs.\n\n6\n00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.232\nYes, you heard it right,\nthere's an extra S on that second one.\n\n7\n00:00:26.232 --> 00:00:29.047\nAnd luckily, we have the very\nperson that will hopefully,\n\n8\n00:00:29.047 --> 00:00:32.163\nguide us to when do we use one\nversus the other, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:32.163 --> 00:00:34.174\nHow are you doing today, Vonne?\n\n10\n00:00:34.174 --> 00:00:35.453\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic.\n\n11\n00:00:35.453 --> 00:00:38.804\n&gt;&gt; That is always good to hear, Vonne,\nI'm glad to have you back in the studio.\n\n12\n00:00:38.804 --> 00:00:40.737\nAnd I'm kind of interested, countif and\n\n13\n00:00:40.737 --> 00:00:43.788\ncountifs, it sounds like I'm\njust saying weird words, wrong.\n\n14\n00:00:43.788 --> 00:00:45.315\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It does, yeah,\n\n15\n00:00:45.315 --> 00:00:48.201\nyou start to kinda blend\nthem all together.\n\n16\n00:00:48.201 --> 00:00:50.837\nBut, yeah, this is where we're going\nto be counting based on a criteria.\n\n17\n00:00:50.837 --> 00:00:54.361\nSo countif would be a single criteria.\n\n18\n00:00:54.361 --> 00:00:57.233\nAnd, what do you think\ncountifs is gonna be?\n\n19\n00:00:57.233 --> 00:01:00.122\nIt's gonna be multiple criterias,\nexactly [LAUGH].\n\n20\n00:01:00.122 --> 00:01:03.002\nSo that's gonna be the difference\nbetween these two functions.\n\n21\n00:01:03.002 --> 00:01:07.989\nAnd so, I have quite a few examples of\nhow we could go ahead and use these.\n\n22\n00:01:07.989 --> 00:01:11.125\nAnd why don't we just jump right on in and\nget started.\n\n23\n00:01:11.125 --> 00:01:13.194\nSo, we've got a CountIf.xlfs.\n\n24\n00:01:13.194 --> 00:01:16.850\nI said that wrong again, man.\n\n25\n00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.968\nIt's just an Excel worksheet, or\nworkbook called countif, how about that?\n\n26\n00:01:18.968 --> 00:01:21.364\n&gt;&gt; Excelsior file.\n\n27\n00:01:21.364 --> 00:01:22.057\nThat's what I said, Excelsior.\n\n28\n00:01:22.057 --> 00:01:24.194\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n29\n00:01:24.194 --> 00:01:28.578\nSo, we've got some [INAUDIBLE] information\nthat we did in our count episode,\n\n30\n00:01:28.578 --> 00:01:30.946\nwe did the count, count a, count blank.\n\n31\n00:01:30.946 --> 00:01:32.614\nAnd so, now we're going to do a countif.\n\n32\n00:01:32.614 --> 00:01:37.434\nI would like to count the number\nof times that we have a category\n\n33\n00:01:37.434 --> 00:01:39.486\nthat equals toys, okay?\n\n34\n00:01:39.486 --> 00:01:42.055\nSo that's our criteria.\n\n35\n00:01:42.055 --> 00:01:44.825\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\ndo the same thing that we've been doing.\n\n36\n00:01:44.825 --> 00:01:48.319\nWe're going to get the cells selected\nthat where we want our answer to go into.\n\n37\n00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.293\nWe go over to our formulas,\nwe can go in to our most recently used.\n\n38\n00:01:52.293 --> 00:01:56.054\nOr we could go ahead and find it\nthrough the insert function dialog box,\n\n39\n00:01:56.054 --> 00:01:57.822\nif we don't know where it's at.\n\n40\n00:01:57.822 --> 00:01:58.958\nSo we can type it in.\n\n41\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:03.230\nThere's our countif, and then we click OK,\nand so it's saying, that we are going\n\n42\n00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.095\nto count the number of cells within\na range that meets the given condition.\n\n43\n00:02:07.095 --> 00:02:11.391\nGreat, so\nwhat's the range that we want to evaluate?\n\n44\n00:02:11.391 --> 00:02:13.296\nWe want to look at all of the categories.\n\n45\n00:02:13.296 --> 00:02:18.059\nSo let's go ahead and select A2\nthrough A15, and then the category is,\n\n46\n00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:19.655\nwe want it to say, toys.\n\n47\n00:02:19.655 --> 00:02:24.210\nNow this is where we're going to\nphysically type in their word,\n\n48\n00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.773\nlet's go ahead and turn the caps lock off,\n[LAUGH], and go with toys.\n\n49\n00:02:28.773 --> 00:02:33.300\nAnd then, if I hit the tab key, just to\nsee within this dialog box, that yep,\n\n50\n00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.100\nit looks like it's given\nus an answer of three.\n\n51\n00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:42.386\nLet's go ahead and click OK, and\nlook at these, there's one, two, three.\n\n52\n00:02:42.386 --> 00:02:44.079\nThere are three toys right\nhere within this category.\n\n53\n00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.495\nSo it did exactly what\nit is supposed to do.\n\n54\n00:02:48.495 --> 00:02:50.211\nAll right, well let's just go ahead and\n\n55\n00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:52.290\npoint out before we get\ntoo much further in here.\n\n56\n00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.867\nThat when we physically typed in the word\ntoys, notice how it put the quotations\n\n57\n00:02:57.867 --> 00:03:02.626\naround the word toys, because it is\nseeing this as a string of text.\n\n58\n00:03:02.626 --> 00:03:05.756\nSo that's gonna happen anytime that\nyou go ahead and type out a value.\n\n59\n00:03:05.756 --> 00:03:09.400\nRather than using our cell reference,\nas you can see down here,\n\n60\n00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.247\nwhere we will go ahead,\nand use a cell reference.\n\n61\n00:03:12.247 --> 00:03:16.310\nSo, just one more time, let's go ahead and\ndo the same thing here.\n\n62\n00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.012\nSo, now if I'm gonna type it in, and\nI want it to evaluate that I want\n\n63\n00:03:21.012 --> 00:03:24.574\nthe quantity that's going\nto be greater than six.\n\n64\n00:03:24.574 --> 00:03:29.100\nLet's try a different way instead\nusing the insert function dialog box,\n\n65\n00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.633\nlet's just type it out.\n\n66\n00:03:30.633 --> 00:03:34.057\nLet's go equals, and\nwe will start count, and\n\n67\n00:03:34.057 --> 00:03:38.095\nthen let's drop down using\nour down arrows to count if.\n\n68\n00:03:38.095 --> 00:03:39.585\nHit that Tab key over there.\n\n69\n00:03:39.585 --> 00:03:41.345\nAnd what is our range?\n\n70\n00:03:41.345 --> 00:03:46.853\nLet's go ahead and select with our mouse,\nthe range that we want to evaluate.\n\n71\n00:03:46.853 --> 00:03:50.523\nThen we're going to type in a comma,\nbecause that's what we need to do for\n\n72\n00:03:50.523 --> 00:03:51.544\nthe proper syntax.\n\n73\n00:03:51.544 --> 00:03:58.180\nAnd then the criteria would be\ngreater than or equal to six.\n\n74\n00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.473\nAnd we're like, yeah, I'm doing good.\n\n75\n00:03:59.473 --> 00:04:04.279\nWe hit Enter, and then it's gonna tell\nme that it doesn't like that, okay.\n\n76\n00:04:04.279 --> 00:04:07.861\nAnd that is because we forgot\nto put those quotations around.\n\n77\n00:04:07.861 --> 00:04:12.095\nSo it's just like we were doing in\nthe dialog box, where it did it for us.\n\n78\n00:04:12.095 --> 00:04:15.395\nIf we would have done the dialog box,\nand just typed that in,\n\n79\n00:04:15.395 --> 00:04:17.878\nit would have put that\nquotations around it.\n\n80\n00:04:17.878 --> 00:04:20.409\nBut, since we're typing it out,\n\n81\n00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:25.746\nwe need to make sure that we remember\nto go ahead and put the quotes there.\n\n82\n00:04:25.746 --> 00:04:30.820\nAnd so now, when I hit Enter, it will\ngo ahead and do that, which is weird.\n\n83\n00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.479\nAnd actually, before the episode, and\nwe don't wanna get too deep into it.\n\n84\n00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.211\nI know that was kinda throwing you for\na loop there, Justin.\n\n85\n00:04:38.211 --> 00:04:42.632\nBecause of the operators with the string\nof text, and something with programming,\n\n86\n00:04:42.632 --> 00:04:45.195\nand it breaks things, and\nall that kinda stuff.\n\n87\n00:04:45.195 --> 00:04:49.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's generally discouraged\nusing a string to evaluate comparisons.\n\n88\n00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.231\nBecause mostly from my aspect,\nyou're taking outside user input,\n\n89\n00:04:53.231 --> 00:04:55.773\nwhich could lead to\nsecurity vulnerabilities.\n\n90\n00:04:55.773 --> 00:05:00.041\nNot necessarily, there are times where\nyou may wanna use something like this.\n\n91\n00:05:00.041 --> 00:05:01.065\nBut you always have to be iffy.\n\n92\n00:05:01.065 --> 00:05:03.139\nBut, since you're building\nyour own spreadsheet,\n\n93\n00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:04.668\nyou know what input's gonna be there.\n\n94\n00:05:04.668 --> 00:05:07.554\nI'm pretty sure it's okay to do that.\n\n95\n00:05:07.554 --> 00:05:10.493\nNow, if your spreadsheet is\naggregating a bunch of user input, and\n\n96\n00:05:10.493 --> 00:05:12.933\nthen doing a comparison,\nit could be a little bit iffy.\n\n97\n00:05:12.933 --> 00:05:14.940\nBut just keep that in mind.\n\n98\n00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.818\nIt is text that is evaluating\nto some kind of relationship,\n\n99\n00:05:17.818 --> 00:05:19.607\nin order to make those comparisons.\n\n100\n00:05:19.607 --> 00:05:23.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and for somebody, me,\nlike a regular Office user,\n\n101\n00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.156\nI'm not a super crazy coder person.\n\n102\n00:05:25.156 --> 00:05:29.599\nI know for you, as a coder person, you're\njust like, wooh, that's kinda breaking\n\n103\n00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:34.126\nsome rules in there So if you're like, I\ndon't know what he just said, that's okay.\n\n104\n00:05:34.126 --> 00:05:37.076\nBut just know that for us,\nwhen we're working in Excel,\n\n105\n00:05:37.076 --> 00:05:38.494\nit does need to treat that.\n\n106\n00:05:38.494 --> 00:05:41.076\nEven though it has an operator in there,\nas a string of text,\n\n107\n00:05:41.076 --> 00:05:43.116\nbecause we're physically\ntyping it in there.\n\n108\n00:05:43.116 --> 00:05:46.664\nSo, wanted to make that point there for\nyou guys.\n\n109\n00:05:46.664 --> 00:05:50.503\nSo that's where we wanna head and\nbase a count on a criteria, a countif.\n\n110\n00:05:50.503 --> 00:05:54.214\nAnd yes, we can totally use\na cell reference in that,\n\n111\n00:05:54.214 --> 00:05:56.450\nif I wanted to do the same thing.\n\n112\n00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.141\nLet's go to the insert\nfunction dialog box again, and\n\n113\n00:06:00.141 --> 00:06:03.441\nwe'll go with the range\nof category right here.\n\n114\n00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:07.854\nThe criteria, now we wanna go ahead and\nsay that it is clothing,\n\n115\n00:06:07.854 --> 00:06:09.999\nand that is my cell reference.\n\n116\n00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:13.590\nAnd that's what I want to go ahead and do.\n\n117\n00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:18.787\nYou click OK, and it gives us that we\nhave four clothing, same thing here.\n\n118\n00:06:18.787 --> 00:06:20.542\nLet's go ahead and type it out.\n\n119\n00:06:20.542 --> 00:06:24.438\nWe'll say, =countif, same thing, tab.\n\n120\n00:06:24.438 --> 00:06:31.950\nSelect the cells, hit Enter, and this is\nwhere, it has too few of an argument.\n\n121\n00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.495\nWhy is that?\nWell, why don't I go ahead and\n\n122\n00:06:34.495 --> 00:06:36.514\nclose the parentheses.\n\n123\n00:06:36.514 --> 00:06:38.071\nOkay, really?\nWell, you know what,\n\n124\n00:06:38.071 --> 00:06:42.110\nthis is where we'll go ahead and escape,\nand use the function dialogue box.\n\n125\n00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.047\n[LAUGH] Let's try that again.\n\n126\n00:06:45.047 --> 00:06:47.159\nSo we'll go ahead and\ncountif, and we'll click OK.\n\n127\n00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:50.032\nWe'll select all of these.\n\n128\n00:06:50.032 --> 00:06:54.004\nUse my criteria to be accessories and\nthen, that's what I was trying to do.\n\n129\n00:06:54.004 --> 00:06:56.761\n[LAUGH] And I'm a little.\n\n130\n00:06:56.761 --> 00:07:01.136\n&gt;&gt; So Vonne, I can actually clarify\nthis for you, cuz I was like there.\n\n131\n00:07:01.136 --> 00:07:02.768\nSo whoops, forgot the criteria.\n\n132\n00:07:02.768 --> 00:07:05.332\nAnd that's important,\nif you're conditionally counting things.\n\n133\n00:07:05.332 --> 00:07:08.036\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly right.\n\n134\n00:07:08.036 --> 00:07:09.644\nYou know, I was just going too fast.\n\n135\n00:07:09.644 --> 00:07:12.248\nThat's where I should\nhave just slowed down,\n\n136\n00:07:12.248 --> 00:07:14.400\njust read the actual helping of like.\n\n137\n00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.794\nHey, here's your criteria.\n\n138\n00:07:15.794 --> 00:07:20.083\nYeah, I was seeing if you were\npaying attention there, Justin.\n\n139\n00:07:20.083 --> 00:07:24.100\n&gt;&gt; Well, I got a gold star for today,\nbut that brings up a good point.\n\n140\n00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.524\nI do the same thing, [SOUND] okay,\nI don't even read it.\n\n141\n00:07:27.524 --> 00:07:32.297\nA lot of times errors, especially in\nExcel, and some of these more point and\n\n142\n00:07:32.297 --> 00:07:33.875\nclick user interfaces.\n\n143\n00:07:33.875 --> 00:07:36.840\nThese indicate to help you\nfigure out what's wrong, so\n\n144\n00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.136\nit's probably in your best\ninterest to actually read those.\n\n145\n00:07:40.136 --> 00:07:45.017\nHowever, we're not immune to it, I do it,\n[SOUND] whatever, I just move along.\n\n146\n00:07:45.017 --> 00:07:47.177\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\ndid you see what I just did is like, wait,\n\n147\n00:07:47.177 --> 00:07:48.498\nI obviously did something wrong.\n\n148\n00:07:48.498 --> 00:07:50.512\nYou know what I'm gonna do?\n\n149\n00:07:50.512 --> 00:07:53.493\nI'm gonna go back to the insert\nfunction dialog box,\n\n150\n00:07:53.493 --> 00:07:57.014\nbecause I like how it helps you\nalong This is what you need to do.\n\n151\n00:07:57.014 --> 00:07:58.475\nThat's what you need,\ncuz I forgot the comma.\n\n152\n00:07:58.475 --> 00:08:02.053\nI just got all kind of turned around.\n\n153\n00:08:02.053 --> 00:08:05.630\nSo if anything, this is the perfect\nteachable moment for if you're\n\n154\n00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:09.600\nnot feeling as confident or something's\nnot right, just jump into that.\n\n155\n00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.474\nAnd it gives you that helping.\n\n156\n00:08:11.474 --> 00:08:13.352\nSo I like that, good.\n\n157\n00:08:13.352 --> 00:08:17.393\nAnd there's another reason you're like\nwhy is it not matching accessories.\n\n158\n00:08:17.393 --> 00:08:23.010\nHey you want to take a gander\nas to why its not matching?\n\n159\n00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:25.997\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to guess there's\nan extra blank space somewhere or\n\n160\n00:08:25.997 --> 00:08:28.931\nsomething like that because as\nI said in a previous episode,\n\n161\n00:08:28.931 --> 00:08:30.667\nthose are the bane of my existence.\n\n162\n00:08:30.667 --> 00:08:32.646\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and its right here.\n\n163\n00:08:32.646 --> 00:08:34.060\nIt's on this cell reference.\n\n164\n00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:37.992\nIf I go to accessories,\nyou can see my cursor right there.\n\n165\n00:08:37.992 --> 00:08:39.486\nThere is a space.\n\n166\n00:08:39.486 --> 00:08:43.821\nIf I backspace that and then hit enter,\nyep, then it's gonna work.\n\n167\n00:08:43.821 --> 00:08:45.949\nAlways gotta look for those white spaces.\n\n168\n00:08:45.949 --> 00:08:51.010\nSo we've got that, and\nthat's what our count if function\n\n169\n00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:55.983\nreally simply does for us is,\ncount based on a criteria.\n\n170\n00:08:55.983 --> 00:08:59.563\nSo let's jump over to this\nworksheet right over here.\n\n171\n00:08:59.563 --> 00:09:04.668\nThis is where, just as an example of, hey,\nI wanna go ahead and count up the number\n\n172\n00:09:04.668 --> 00:09:09.857\nof toys, clothing, food and accessories\nthat we have in this particular column.\n\n173\n00:09:09.857 --> 00:09:15.280\nSo let's start and let's try and\ntype it out again.\n\n174\n00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:16.621\nLet's do equals.\n\n175\n00:09:16.621 --> 00:09:18.691\nAnd we will do the count if,\n\n176\n00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:22.843\nand I will pay attention to\nthe little helper guy here.\n\n177\n00:09:22.843 --> 00:09:24.251\nWhat is my range?\n\n178\n00:09:24.251 --> 00:09:25.713\nHere is my range.\n\n179\n00:09:25.713 --> 00:09:27.960\nNow I gotta make sure I put a comma.\n\n180\n00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.815\nAnd now what's my criteria?\n\n181\n00:09:29.815 --> 00:09:34.326\nWell, here's my cell reference that\nsays toys, and then if I hit Enter.\n\n182\n00:09:34.326 --> 00:09:35.515\nYep, it works.\n\n183\n00:09:35.515 --> 00:09:39.419\nThis is one of the those where hey,\nI wanna now do the same thing for\n\n184\n00:09:39.419 --> 00:09:40.637\nall the way across.\n\n185\n00:09:40.637 --> 00:09:41.819\nYou get excited.\n\n186\n00:09:41.819 --> 00:09:46.396\nYou copy and then it's gonna do\nthe [SOUND] Nope, you can't do that.\n\n187\n00:09:46.396 --> 00:09:50.738\nBecause it's using the relative reference,\nwhich is great for\n\n188\n00:09:50.738 --> 00:09:52.837\nwhat I want the criteria to be.\n\n189\n00:09:52.837 --> 00:09:56.475\nBut not good for,\nif you look up at that formula bar,\n\n190\n00:09:56.475 --> 00:10:00.636\nit moves the column of what\nI'm supposed to be evaluating.\n\n191\n00:10:00.636 --> 00:10:02.638\nSo that's not what you want.\n\n192\n00:10:02.638 --> 00:10:04.317\nSo how do I fix this?\n\n193\n00:10:04.317 --> 00:10:05.936\nUse that absolute reference.\n\n194\n00:10:05.936 --> 00:10:10.156\nI wanna fix the column reference\nhere in this picture before me,\n\n195\n00:10:10.156 --> 00:10:13.999\nbecause this is the range that\nI want to keep going back to.\n\n196\n00:10:13.999 --> 00:10:18.794\nSo we just go ahead and put that\ndollar sign in front of our column and\n\n197\n00:10:18.794 --> 00:10:22.991\nrow references to say always\na two through always a 15 but\n\n198\n00:10:22.991 --> 00:10:25.661\nthe G eight, that's the criteria.\n\n199\n00:10:25.661 --> 00:10:30.841\nThat's this one that does need to go\nahead and use the relative reference.\n\n200\n00:10:30.841 --> 00:10:35.061\nSo we'll go ahead and fix this\nparticular formula here in the toys,\n\n201\n00:10:35.061 --> 00:10:36.773\ncuz that's the right one.\n\n202\n00:10:36.773 --> 00:10:41.817\nNow use the white plus to select, the\nblack plus to fill across, and now it will\n\n203\n00:10:41.817 --> 00:10:46.960\ngo ahead and do what it's suppose to,\nbecause that range will always stay put.\n\n204\n00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:51.260\nSo that's something always good to\nknow about remembering when and\n\n205\n00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:56.014\nwhy you want to use absolute versus\nrelative reference when doing multiple\n\n206\n00:10:56.014 --> 00:10:59.046\nformulas like copying\nacross to other places.\n\n207\n00:10:59.046 --> 00:11:04.503\nAnd just because I can't say\nenough about named ranges.\n\n208\n00:11:04.503 --> 00:11:07.089\nYou watch a couple of my other episodes,\nlike I talk a lot about these.\n\n209\n00:11:07.089 --> 00:11:12.082\nThese are one of those things where\nI feel like it just takes a few steps\n\n210\n00:11:12.082 --> 00:11:16.230\nout of this whole process,\ncuz we had to go back, fix it.\n\n211\n00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:18.975\nNow, if I would have known ahead of time,\nyeah, I could go ahead and\n\n212\n00:11:18.975 --> 00:11:20.725\njust throw in those absolute references.\n\n213\n00:11:20.725 --> 00:11:25.624\nBut named ranges are already\nabsolute references.\n\n214\n00:11:25.624 --> 00:11:29.449\nSo you could see,\nif I select these cells right here,\n\n215\n00:11:29.449 --> 00:11:32.769\nI've already named these\ncells as category.\n\n216\n00:11:32.769 --> 00:11:36.399\nSo if I come back over here to\nthe same thing, all right and\n\n217\n00:11:36.399 --> 00:11:40.030\nthen using the writing the formula,\nwhich I didn't do so\n\n218\n00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:43.453\nwell before but\nnow hopefully we'll do better here.\n\n219\n00:11:43.453 --> 00:11:48.518\nIf I start typing in my formula,\nwe'll do a count if, and then I know that\n\n220\n00:11:48.518 --> 00:11:53.769\nis a named range, so I know my first\nthing is category, there's my range.\n\n221\n00:11:53.769 --> 00:11:58.080\nI love those little helpers right there,\nlike yep, that's what I want.\n\n222\n00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.371\nUse my comma, and\nthen my criteria is toys.\n\n223\n00:12:01.371 --> 00:12:02.298\nAnd then I hit enter.\n\n224\n00:12:02.298 --> 00:12:06.494\nI don't have to remind myself\nto do the absolute reference,\n\n225\n00:12:06.494 --> 00:12:09.879\nbecause category is category,\nno matter what.\n\n226\n00:12:09.879 --> 00:12:11.453\nSo doing the copy over, there we go.\n\n227\n00:12:11.453 --> 00:12:16.759\nIt's just like one less step if you\ngo ahead and use those named ranges.\n\n228\n00:12:16.759 --> 00:12:21.272\nAnd it just makes so much more sense of\nlike category of toys and so on and so\n\n229\n00:12:21.272 --> 00:12:21.799\nforth.\n\n230\n00:12:21.799 --> 00:12:23.634\nSo just throwing that out there for you.\n\n231\n00:12:23.634 --> 00:12:27.271\nLove named ranges so\ngo ahead and try them out.\n\n232\n00:12:27.271 --> 00:12:29.308\nNow, what if I want to do a counting,\na partial?\n\n233\n00:12:29.308 --> 00:12:36.181\nOkay, so right over here, this is what\nwe did with some with the sum ifs.\n\n234\n00:12:36.181 --> 00:12:37.052\nWe did it with this the same example.\n\n235\n00:12:37.052 --> 00:12:41.933\nI feel like we're back to the heart mouse\nand the beach mouse and the bunny mouse.\n\n236\n00:12:41.933 --> 00:12:47.964\nI wanna make sure that I'm counting\nanything that has the word mouse in it.\n\n237\n00:12:47.964 --> 00:12:49.649\nSo let's do that.\n\n238\n00:12:49.649 --> 00:12:53.014\nLet's use our insert\nfunction dialogue box.\n\n239\n00:12:53.014 --> 00:12:54.803\nWe're gonna count if.\n\n240\n00:12:54.803 --> 00:12:57.900\nAnd we will use the range, same one here.\n\n241\n00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:00.022\nAnd let's go with the criteria.\n\n242\n00:13:00.022 --> 00:13:06.169\nIf I type in mouse, I can already\nsee that this is not going to work.\n\n243\n00:13:06.169 --> 00:13:08.799\nThe result is going to be zero.\n\n244\n00:13:08.799 --> 00:13:14.013\nThat's because it's trying to\nfind mouse as an exact match.\n\n245\n00:13:14.013 --> 00:13:16.242\nThere isn't just mouse.\n\n246\n00:13:16.242 --> 00:13:20.818\nIt has either something or\nor something behind it.\n\n247\n00:13:20.818 --> 00:13:23.770\nYou can see that we have our mouse tails.\n\n248\n00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:27.493\nSo this is where we can use\nour wildcard characters.\n\n249\n00:13:27.493 --> 00:13:31.875\nSo I know that if I put an asterisk\nin front of something or\n\n250\n00:13:31.875 --> 00:13:34.970\nbehind it, that indicates anything.\n\n251\n00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:42.190\nSo anything in front of the word mouse and\nalso anything behind the word mouse.\n\n252\n00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:47.144\nSo if I put those two in there, and\nalso notice that it is lowercase.\n\n253\n00:13:47.144 --> 00:13:49.402\nIt's going to return any of the case.\n\n254\n00:13:49.402 --> 00:13:54.005\nIt is not case sensitive in this\nparticular example right here to where,\n\n255\n00:13:54.005 --> 00:13:57.334\nyep, it found one, two,\nthree, four, five six.\n\n256\n00:13:57.334 --> 00:13:57.852\nThat's right.\n\n257\n00:13:57.852 --> 00:14:02.048\nNotice it also, since I'm using\nan insert function dialog box,\n\n258\n00:14:02.048 --> 00:14:06.494\nto put in those quotes around it,\nbecause it is finding that as text.\n\n259\n00:14:06.494 --> 00:14:09.187\nSo if we click OK,\nthat's exactly what I want.\n\n260\n00:14:09.187 --> 00:14:13.562\nSo that's something that can be really,\nreally handy there.\n\n261\n00:14:13.562 --> 00:14:17.183\nNow if you're going to be\nusing the same idea, the same,\n\n262\n00:14:17.183 --> 00:14:21.797\nI want to use wild card characters,\nbut you're using cell references.\n\n263\n00:14:21.797 --> 00:14:24.898\nThat's what gets a little\ntricky in a sense.\n\n264\n00:14:24.898 --> 00:14:26.820\nSo let's start it again.\n\n265\n00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:29.903\nWe'll go ahead and\ndo the count if, same thing.\n\n266\n00:14:29.903 --> 00:14:32.002\nHere's our range.\n\n267\n00:14:32.002 --> 00:14:35.039\nHere's our criteria and\nyou're thinking,all right.\n\n268\n00:14:35.039 --> 00:14:38.948\nSo now, since this is just H10,\nit is finding mouse,\n\n269\n00:14:38.948 --> 00:14:43.943\nlet's just put those same wild card\ncharacters that we did before, and\n\n270\n00:14:43.943 --> 00:14:48.709\nwe click OK and it's going to say,\nnope, that didn't work at all.\n\n271\n00:14:48.709 --> 00:14:50.015\nWell, why not?\n\n272\n00:14:50.015 --> 00:14:56.019\nWell, because when you're using asterisks\nwith a combination of cell references\n\n273\n00:14:56.019 --> 00:15:02.020\nbeing wild cards, you have to write the\nformula in a, we'll call it a special way,\n\n274\n00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:07.538\nto make sure it understands, take this\nthing that we're treating as text.\n\n275\n00:15:07.538 --> 00:15:12.393\nThen add it into whatever is in\nthe content of that particular cell.\n\n276\n00:15:12.393 --> 00:15:16.584\nAnd then since we have another\nwildcard on the other side,\n\n277\n00:15:16.584 --> 00:15:20.871\nadd that into looking at this\nas anything with text past it.\n\n278\n00:15:20.871 --> 00:15:21.487\nSo let me show you.\n\n279\n00:15:21.487 --> 00:15:26.923\nWe are gonna go ahead and up in the\nformula bar, we're going to go ahead and\n\n280\n00:15:26.923 --> 00:15:31.221\nput that this is text,\nanything in text, combined with,\n\n281\n00:15:31.221 --> 00:15:37.212\nyou have to use that ampersand, that and,\nkinda like concatenate it together.\n\n282\n00:15:37.212 --> 00:15:43.153\nAnd then on the other side, we need to put\nanother ampersand and then another quote.\n\n283\n00:15:43.153 --> 00:15:48.091\nSo text combined with cell content,\nthen text.\n\n284\n00:15:48.091 --> 00:15:48.640\nWe go ahead and hit enter.\nAnd\n\n285\n00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.645\nthat's where it will\ngive us the same results.\n\n286\n00:15:51.645 --> 00:15:56.757\nSo it's a little extra work and\nyou have to manually type this in.\n\n287\n00:15:56.757 --> 00:16:01.631\nEven using the cell, the insert function\ndialogue box, like I like to do.\n\n288\n00:16:01.631 --> 00:16:03.089\nIt still didn't help me in that.\n\n289\n00:16:03.089 --> 00:16:06.964\nSo that's just kind of like a little\nthing you need to know about,\n\n290\n00:16:06.964 --> 00:16:10.072\nif you're kind of combining\nwild card characters.\n\n291\n00:16:10.072 --> 00:16:12.922\nAnd anything with text\nwith a content of a cell.\n\n292\n00:16:12.922 --> 00:16:16.261\nSo just keep that in mind there,\nif you need to ever use that.\n\n293\n00:16:16.261 --> 00:16:20.076\nBecause now, if we took this,\nthis is like well, why wouldn't I just,\n\n294\n00:16:20.076 --> 00:16:22.343\nthis one seemed a lot easier, wasn't it?\n\n295\n00:16:22.343 --> 00:16:25.009\nYeah, but then,\nwe have some flexibility here.\n\n296\n00:16:25.009 --> 00:16:29.517\nIf I typed in like the word ball,\nyou can see there's like a crank-a ball,\n\n297\n00:16:29.517 --> 00:16:31.750\na spark-a ball, and a bouncy ball.\n\n298\n00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:34.869\nIf I go there, then it's going ahead and\ngiving me three.\n\n299\n00:16:34.869 --> 00:16:37.263\nSo, it depends on which\nway you need to go.\n\n300\n00:16:37.263 --> 00:16:40.082\nThe flexibility and the dynamicness,\n\n301\n00:16:40.082 --> 00:16:43.590\ndynamicness is that even a word there,\nJustin?\n\n302\n00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:46.993\n&gt;&gt; Dynamic, dynamis, dynamicism.\n\n303\n00:16:46.993 --> 00:16:51.079\nYou know what, Vonne, I don't know,\nwe'll go with what you said, originally.\n\n304\n00:16:51.079 --> 00:16:52.865\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well actually,\n\n305\n00:16:52.865 --> 00:16:55.548\nnow I forgot what I said [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's dynamic.\n\n306\n00:16:55.548 --> 00:16:58.711\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's exactly what-\n&gt;&gt; And we have a solution to a problem,\n\n307\n00:16:58.711 --> 00:17:01.282\nway to think outside of the box,\nteam work there.\n\n308\n00:17:01.282 --> 00:17:05.101\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, I do like to make up my own\nwords there, so yes, we wanna go ahead.\n\n309\n00:17:05.101 --> 00:17:08.359\nAnd have that flexibility of\nusing the cell reference, and\n\n310\n00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:10.062\nthen we can replace the value.\n\n311\n00:17:10.062 --> 00:17:13.671\nAnd there's our [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There you go.\n\n312\n00:17:13.671 --> 00:17:15.396\n&gt;&gt; There you go, folks [LAUGH].\n\n313\n00:17:15.396 --> 00:17:18.268\n[LAUGH] All right, so let's move on.\n\n314\n00:17:18.268 --> 00:17:22.858\nSo we've got another simple, this is\njust carried over from our account one.\n\n315\n00:17:22.858 --> 00:17:24.644\nSo just again,\nmore things that we could talk about.\n\n316\n00:17:24.644 --> 00:17:28.754\nIf I wanted to now have it to where,\nif there's an L in this,\n\n317\n00:17:28.754 --> 00:17:32.068\nand there's an L here,\nand there's an L here.\n\n318\n00:17:32.068 --> 00:17:34.517\nThat's one where we would\nwanna do a countif criteria.\n\n319\n00:17:34.517 --> 00:17:38.099\nSo, let's type in our countif, and\n\n320\n00:17:38.099 --> 00:17:42.151\nthen we will tab, we will come over here.\n\n321\n00:17:42.151 --> 00:17:48.296\nSelect our range use, our comma, and then,\nopen the quote, and type in the letter L.\n\n322\n00:17:48.296 --> 00:17:51.068\nClose the quote,\nbecause we know that, that is text.\n\n323\n00:17:51.068 --> 00:17:53.389\nHit Enter,\nthere's not going to be anything in there.\n\n324\n00:17:53.389 --> 00:17:57.992\nBut double click with the fill handle,\nand then it will go ahead, yep,\n\n325\n00:17:57.992 --> 00:18:00.773\nthere's an L there, there's an L there.\n\n326\n00:18:00.773 --> 00:18:04.779\nSo that's just again, another example\ncarrying over from our other counts.\n\n327\n00:18:04.779 --> 00:18:08.187\nI wanted to go ahead and\nthrow that in there, so now,\n\n328\n00:18:08.187 --> 00:18:10.210\nlet's move over to countifs.\n\n329\n00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:12.567\nMm, countifs multiple criteria.\n\n330\n00:18:12.567 --> 00:18:17.186\nSo for this particular example,\nwe wanted to countif the toy, toys,\n\n331\n00:18:17.186 --> 00:18:21.827\nthat's our category, with a quantity\ngreater than or equal to four.\n\n332\n00:18:21.827 --> 00:18:25.192\nSo, if I look at the toys,\nand I did went ahead and\n\n333\n00:18:25.192 --> 00:18:29.233\nbold this just to make it a little\neasier for us to see here.\n\n334\n00:18:29.233 --> 00:18:33.601\nIf it's greater than four, greater than or\nequal to four, so right there,\n\n335\n00:18:33.601 --> 00:18:38.331\nit would be one, two, three, it should\nbe five, that's going to be our result.\n\n336\n00:18:38.331 --> 00:18:42.742\nAgain, very easy to have with ten values,\nyou have 10,000 values,\n\n337\n00:18:42.742 --> 00:18:46.744\nyou're gonna wanna have the functions\nto be able to do this for you.\n\n338\n00:18:46.744 --> 00:18:50.634\nSo let's go with our inter function\ndialog box, cuz I love that,\n\n339\n00:18:50.634 --> 00:18:52.420\nwe're gonna go to countifs.\n\n340\n00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:57.287\nHere's our first criteria range, so\nwe want to select these cells here.\n\n341\n00:18:57.287 --> 00:18:58.169\nWell, what is the criteria?\n\n342\n00:18:58.169 --> 00:19:01.294\nWe're going to physically\ntype in the word toys, and\n\n343\n00:19:01.294 --> 00:19:04.293\nwe know it's gonna put\nthe parentheses around it.\n\n344\n00:19:04.293 --> 00:19:06.392\nAnd it's giving me eight, all right.\n\n345\n00:19:06.392 --> 00:19:07.666\nSo good, we're on the right track.\n\n346\n00:19:07.666 --> 00:19:12.850\nSo now the next criteria range, would be\nnow go ahead and look at the quantity.\n\n347\n00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:19.852\nThe quantity has to be greater than or\nequal to four.\n\n348\n00:19:19.852 --> 00:19:23.650\nAnd then, if I hit the tab key here,\ncuz that's just cycling me out of this\n\n349\n00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:27.107\nparticular field, it does give me five,\nand then, there you go.\n\n350\n00:19:27.107 --> 00:19:32.894\nAnd that is countifs, cuz we have\nmultiple criteria that we are evaluating.\n\n351\n00:19:32.894 --> 00:19:37.494\nAs you can see, as I keep on, I just gonna\ntab through here, we can have a whole,\n\n352\n00:19:37.494 --> 00:19:38.749\nhow many can we have?\n\n353\n00:19:38.749 --> 00:19:44.637\nOkay, well alot [LAUGH], so I keep on\ntabbing through, now what is the range.\n\n354\n00:19:44.637 --> 00:19:47.665\nI'm gonna say 255 or 256,\nbut I really don't know.\n\n355\n00:19:47.665 --> 00:19:51.152\nIf you have 255 criteria is a lot.\n\n356\n00:19:51.152 --> 00:19:53.743\n&gt;&gt; Couple of points on that.\nIt's like you're reading my mind, so\n\n357\n00:19:53.743 --> 00:19:55.060\nkinda freaking me out.\n\n358\n00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:58.319\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But second point, if you have,\n\n359\n00:19:58.319 --> 00:20:01.966\neven if it's a 100,\nif you have 100 conditions.\n\n360\n00:20:01.966 --> 00:20:04.512\nAnd you may wanna look at\nreorganizing your data, and\n\n361\n00:20:04.512 --> 00:20:08.654\nmaybe breaking those conditionals up and\nthen doing conditions on those reductions.\n\n362\n00:20:08.654 --> 00:20:12.524\nJust to give some granularity,\ncuz otherwise, give a 100 conditions in\n\n363\n00:20:12.524 --> 00:20:15.859\na countifs, and you're wrong,\nand one of them, or something.\n\n364\n00:20:15.859 --> 00:20:18.905\nYou're like, man, I gotta go back and\nlook through all that.\n\n365\n00:20:18.905 --> 00:20:21.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I would just be very careful about\n\n366\n00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:21.921\nthat.\n\n367\n00:20:21.921 --> 00:20:25.714\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, a couple,\neven like four or five, okay, that's fine.\n\n368\n00:20:25.714 --> 00:20:27.979\nEspecially, if you have a large dataset,\nokay.\n\n369\n00:20:27.979 --> 00:20:30.401\nI need to find, in this store,\nwith this salesperson,\n\n370\n00:20:30.401 --> 00:20:32.060\nwith this particular manufacturer.\n\n371\n00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:35.608\nThat I can understand,\nyou can go pretty deep.\n\n372\n00:20:35.608 --> 00:20:38.871\nBut yeah, you don't wanna go too,\ntoo crazy on that one, so.\n\n373\n00:20:38.871 --> 00:20:42.201\nBut at least we know,\nwe have a lot of multiple criterias.\n\n374\n00:20:42.201 --> 00:20:43.415\nSo let's go ahead and finish this one up.\n\n375\n00:20:43.415 --> 00:20:47.795\nI just hit in the OK button,\nand that's what we've got.\n\n376\n00:20:47.795 --> 00:20:51.432\nAnd then, I just went ahead and I did\nadd a third one here, to where we could\n\n377\n00:20:51.432 --> 00:20:54.926\nalso use the cell references,\ninstead of physically typing them in.\n\n378\n00:20:54.926 --> 00:20:58.840\nSo let's find the three\ncriterias that we have.\n\n379\n00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.971\nLet's go with the answer,\nI do like the dialog box.\n\n380\n00:21:01.971 --> 00:21:03.857\nI'm gonna tell you guys that,\n\n381\n00:21:03.857 --> 00:21:07.936\nyou guys have probably seen this\nthroughout this entire episode.\n\n382\n00:21:07.936 --> 00:21:12.230\nSo let's find first criteria, and\nthen the criteria is toys, okay?\n\n383\n00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:13.402\nWe got eight, good.\n\n384\n00:21:13.402 --> 00:21:17.321\nLet's go with our second one,\nwe have to have the quantity.\n\n385\n00:21:17.321 --> 00:21:22.294\nThat is greater than 4, but that is typed\ninto our cell, so we're going there.\n\n386\n00:21:22.294 --> 00:21:27.630\nAnd then, the next one would be, let's\nlook at our stores, and then the store.\n\n387\n00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:32.525\nLet's hit the tab key, so gets us into\nour criteria, would be Kingsville, and\n\n388\n00:21:32.525 --> 00:21:34.001\nthat is exactly right.\n\n389\n00:21:34.001 --> 00:21:38.587\nSo, we have greater than four, but then\nthree of of them are in the Tampa store,\n\n390\n00:21:38.587 --> 00:21:40.652\ntwo of them are in the Gainesville.\n\n391\n00:21:40.652 --> 00:21:44.360\nWe click OK, and\nthere's our multiple criterias.\n\n392\n00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:48.332\nSo, good stuff right there,\njust go ahead and keep on adding.\n\n393\n00:21:48.332 --> 00:21:50.586\nAgain, starts looking kind of scary,\n\n394\n00:21:50.586 --> 00:21:54.289\nwhen we look at it just reading\nthe formula from the formula bar.\n\n395\n00:21:54.289 --> 00:21:57.838\nAnd the last one I wanted to show you,\nis just one of those,\n\n396\n00:21:57.838 --> 00:22:01.331\nagain emphasizing the whole\nidea of what to I need to fix?\n\n397\n00:22:01.331 --> 00:22:02.937\nWhat do I need to not fix?\n\n398\n00:22:02.937 --> 00:22:05.381\nSo, if I was gonna go through here,\n\n399\n00:22:05.381 --> 00:22:09.464\nmaybe we have to where the games\nwere stored in Tampa store.\n\n400\n00:22:09.464 --> 00:22:13.818\nThey're having a softball tournament,\nor something to that effect.\n\n401\n00:22:13.818 --> 00:22:18.462\nAnd so, they're ordering t-shirts, and so\nwe're going to need to get a count of how\n\n402\n00:22:18.462 --> 00:22:22.608\nmany people in Gainesville need a small,\nmedium, large, or extra large?\n\n403\n00:22:22.608 --> 00:22:27.215\nLet's go and do a countifs, and\nthe first criteria would be,\n\n404\n00:22:27.215 --> 00:22:31.216\nlet's look at the store,\nand then we get that range.\n\n405\n00:22:31.216 --> 00:22:34.849\nThe criteria would be Gainesville,\nall right,\n\n406\n00:22:34.849 --> 00:22:39.911\nthen the next criteria,\nmoving this around, let's scroll on up.\n\n407\n00:22:39.911 --> 00:22:44.590\nLet's get the small column, and\nthen, the criteria would be,\n\n408\n00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:50.496\nlet's use a cell reference there, as well,\nsince we've already typed it out.\n\n409\n00:22:50.496 --> 00:22:54.724\nAnd that's looks good, we click OK,\nand it looks like I have a problem.\n\n410\n00:22:54.724 --> 00:22:58.020\nAnd what is the problem?\n\n411\n00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:03.466\nWell, this is a value, so,\nlet's see what we've got going on.\n\n412\n00:23:03.466 --> 00:23:04.461\nWhat is the problem here?\n\n413\n00:23:04.461 --> 00:23:08.719\nLet's look at it, I know what I did.\n\n414\n00:23:08.719 --> 00:23:12.822\nOkay, but by any chance, do you,\nI'm putting you on the spot there, Justin.\n\n415\n00:23:12.822 --> 00:23:16.935\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nI do like a little live action debugging.\n\n416\n00:23:16.935 --> 00:23:22.080\nSo, I'm gonna guess that you actually\ntried to count the X's in the small.\n\n417\n00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.540\nAm I on the right track?\n\n418\n00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:27.255\nLike, we're using the small column, but\n\n419\n00:23:27.255 --> 00:23:30.359\nwe actually wanna countif if it's an X,\nright?\n\n420\n00:23:30.359 --> 00:23:35.067\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that is true, okay, so,\nwe need to make sure that there's two,\n\n421\n00:23:35.067 --> 00:23:38.479\nthat's actually,\nthere's two things now [LAUGH].\n\n422\n00:23:38.479 --> 00:23:41.474\nSo we've got B2, and then the B22.\n\n423\n00:23:41.474 --> 00:23:45.482\nThis one says C1, so sometimes,\nwhen it doesn't match up the ranges,\n\n424\n00:23:45.482 --> 00:23:46.807\nit gets a little wonky.\n\n425\n00:23:46.807 --> 00:23:51.118\nBut yes, the J4's like,\nwe have that we wanna go ahead and\n\n426\n00:23:51.118 --> 00:23:53.804\ndo small, but I was actually wrong.\n\n427\n00:23:53.804 --> 00:24:00.214\nI don't want to say does it equal small,\nI want it to equal what.\n\n428\n00:24:00.214 --> 00:24:02.053\nX, it has to equal X.\n\n429\n00:24:02.053 --> 00:24:03.643\nLet's see if that fixes it.\n\n430\n00:24:03.643 --> 00:24:07.974\nOkay, it still doesn't work, and that's\nwhere I'm almost positive right here,\n\n431\n00:24:07.974 --> 00:24:09.257\nif we change this to two.\n\n432\n00:24:09.257 --> 00:24:11.561\nAnd then we go ahead, then it does it.\n\n433\n00:24:11.561 --> 00:24:14.597\nIt doesn't like when it sees\ndifferent ranges sometimes.\n\n434\n00:24:14.597 --> 00:24:17.385\nAnd so it's like, okay,\nwe have to evaluate and\n\n435\n00:24:17.385 --> 00:24:20.316\nwe have one without a heading,\none with a heading.\n\n436\n00:24:20.316 --> 00:24:22.310\nAnd that throws it off for some reason.\n\n437\n00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:24.633\nSo that's something that we need to do.\n\n438\n00:24:24.633 --> 00:24:28.663\nSo that was actually two troubleshootings\nin one, and we didn't plan that one.\n\n439\n00:24:28.663 --> 00:24:30.949\n[LAUGH] That's not in the notes.\n\n440\n00:24:30.949 --> 00:24:33.294\n&gt;&gt; It is, and it's definitely not,\nI can vouch for that.\n\n441\n00:24:33.294 --> 00:24:37.703\nBut however, I like that you were like,\nall right, let me just analyze this.\n\n442\n00:24:37.703 --> 00:24:41.792\nAnd this is something that you're probably\ngonna have to do through data analysis and\n\n443\n00:24:41.792 --> 00:24:42.883\nsome previous roles.\n\n444\n00:24:42.883 --> 00:24:44.816\nI've definitely spent\na chunk of time going,\n\n445\n00:24:44.816 --> 00:24:47.598\nthere's a parentheses around\nhere somewhere that I'm missing.\n\n446\n00:24:47.598 --> 00:24:50.956\nOr just like this,\nI accidentally selected a heading in one,\n\n447\n00:24:50.956 --> 00:24:52.388\nheading not in the other.\n\n448\n00:24:52.388 --> 00:24:54.451\nMy range is actually\nhave different numbers.\n\n449\n00:24:54.451 --> 00:24:56.033\nI like to think of it as a zipper.\n\n450\n00:24:56.033 --> 00:24:57.915\nA lot of these, they need to zip together.\n\n451\n00:24:57.915 --> 00:25:01.533\nAnd then if your zipper's all like\nshifted off by one, it's weird, so.\n\n452\n00:25:01.533 --> 00:25:03.662\n&gt;&gt; That's a great example,\nI've love that [LAUGH].\n\n453\n00:25:03.662 --> 00:25:05.644\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly right.\n\n454\n00:25:05.644 --> 00:25:07.768\nAnd I can tell you from my coding days,\nHTML.\n\n455\n00:25:07.768 --> 00:25:11.572\nYeah, there's a missing quote,\nthere's a missing equals.\n\n456\n00:25:11.572 --> 00:25:15.074\nAnd you're spending a half an hour looking\nat it, somebody comes along and goes,\n\n457\n00:25:15.074 --> 00:25:15.957\nit's right there.\n\n458\n00:25:15.957 --> 00:25:16.640\nYou're like, aah [LAUGH].\n\n459\n00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.408\n&gt;&gt; It's probably one of the most\ndeflating experiences you're gonna\n\n460\n00:25:18.408 --> 00:25:18.911\nhave in your life.\n\n461\n00:25:18.911 --> 00:25:20.805\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah it happens a lot [LAUGH].\n\n462\n00:25:20.805 --> 00:25:23.318\n[LAUGH] So those are ones we can do.\n\n463\n00:25:23.318 --> 00:25:26.749\nNow the whole thing we were\ncoming back to here was that,\n\n464\n00:25:26.749 --> 00:25:28.648\nif I wanted to use this across.\n\n465\n00:25:28.648 --> 00:25:32.536\nSo now, I wanna go ahead and\nsee the difference like the mediums, and\n\n466\n00:25:32.536 --> 00:25:34.760\nlargest, and the extra largest here.\n\n467\n00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:37.904\nWell, we we're using and this is again,\nI loved the color codings.\n\n468\n00:25:37.904 --> 00:25:42.802\nSo if I clicked up here, yes,\nI said I wanted to use Gainesville.\n\n469\n00:25:42.802 --> 00:25:47.777\nAnd I wanted to go ahead and count if it\nhas an x, and then moved across to medium,\n\n470\n00:25:47.777 --> 00:25:49.283\nlarge and extra large.\n\n471\n00:25:49.283 --> 00:25:52.464\nBut I need to make sure I\nfixate some of these things.\n\n472\n00:25:52.464 --> 00:25:56.877\nI needed to always come back and\nkeep looking at the Gainesville.\n\n473\n00:25:56.877 --> 00:25:59.557\nAnd then, the small, medium,\nand large needs to move.\n\n474\n00:25:59.557 --> 00:26:04.619\nSo we need to ahead and\nabsolute reference our range here.\n\n475\n00:26:04.619 --> 00:26:07.973\nAnd then our range here, but we also have\nto make sure we don't move the criteria.\n\n476\n00:26:07.973 --> 00:26:11.798\nIt still needs to stay in Gainesville,\nso let's go ahead and\n\n477\n00:26:11.798 --> 00:26:14.730\nabsolute reference that particular cell,.\n\n478\n00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:18.907\nThen the C2 through C22, that will move\nover to the medium, large and extra large.\n\n479\n00:26:18.907 --> 00:26:22.142\nSo we're good there\neverything else is set.\n\n480\n00:26:22.142 --> 00:26:23.738\nStill gives you the same result,\n\n481\n00:26:23.738 --> 00:26:26.362\nbecause it really comes\nthrough when you copy across.\n\n482\n00:26:26.362 --> 00:26:31.311\nAnd then, I can tell that yep, there's\nmy one medium, there's my three larges,\n\n483\n00:26:31.311 --> 00:26:34.015\nand my four extra larges,\nso that will work.\n\n484\n00:26:34.015 --> 00:26:36.504\nAnd then you would do the exact\nsame thing for Tampa.\n\n485\n00:26:36.504 --> 00:26:39.542\nI will say, if you try it like,\nooh, go ahead and do this,\n\n486\n00:26:39.542 --> 00:26:43.824\nwe're gonna have the same problem that I\njust experienced with the mixed matching\n\n487\n00:26:43.824 --> 00:26:45.333\nthat you said, the zipper.\n\n488\n00:26:45.333 --> 00:26:48.990\nSo sometimes trying to\ncome back through here and\n\n489\n00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:53.803\ntry to see does that work right or\nnot, cuz I can tell there is four\n\n490\n00:26:53.803 --> 00:26:58.550\nsmalls in Tampa That's where\nit's gonna do the color coding.\n\n491\n00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:00.976\nSee, it moved down, the zipper,\nman, the zipper, I love that.\n\n492\n00:27:00.976 --> 00:27:05.439\n[LAUGH] So I could still go ahead,\nthat's right.\n\n493\n00:27:05.439 --> 00:27:09.895\nThis would turn to I6, okay,\nbecause that's gonna do the Tampa.\n\n494\n00:27:09.895 --> 00:27:13.622\nBut then I gotta move this up,\nthis has got to match with this one.\n\n495\n00:27:13.622 --> 00:27:20.583\nSo I would need to make this C2 move\nit up, but that's C's gotta move up to.\n\n496\n00:27:20.583 --> 00:27:24.430\nThis is gotta go to C22, so\nthat way our zippers are matching up.\n\n497\n00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:29.150\nAnd then, if I hit Enter,\ncuz everything else is okay.\n\n498\n00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:32.825\nThat will give me four,\nthen I can pull it over, and\n\n499\n00:27:32.825 --> 00:27:35.994\nit will be accurate of\nwhat our numbers are.\n\n500\n00:27:35.994 --> 00:27:41.407\nSo, I'm actually glad that we had\na big mistake there, minor mistake\n\n501\n00:27:41.407 --> 00:27:46.746\nto be able to do that trouble shooting,\nand use that zipper analogy.\n\n502\n00:27:46.746 --> 00:27:48.284\nWords.\n&gt;&gt; Words.\n\n503\n00:27:48.284 --> 00:27:48.942\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Words are hard.\n\n504\n00:27:48.942 --> 00:27:51.294\nWords are definitely hard.\n\n505\n00:27:51.294 --> 00:27:54.625\nAnd some of the most kind of the learning\nexperiences you're gonna have is.\n\n506\n00:27:54.625 --> 00:27:59.347\nYou mess up and you have to fix a problem,\nso definitely don't shy away from those.\n\n507\n00:27:59.347 --> 00:28:02.408\nAnd we'd like to keep those in, because\nit shows you, how do I think about this?\n\n508\n00:28:02.408 --> 00:28:06.367\nHow do I solve this issue even though\nwe're learning new concepts at the time?\n\n509\n00:28:06.367 --> 00:28:08.412\nBecause if you're learning something new,\n\n510\n00:28:08.412 --> 00:28:11.758\nyou'll definitely run into problems\nthat you definitely have to solve.\n\n511\n00:28:11.758 --> 00:28:15.868\nI used definitely like seven times in that\nsense, but we're gonna go with it, but\n\n512\n00:28:15.868 --> 00:28:18.026\nVonne, is there any parting words for us?\n\n513\n00:28:18.026 --> 00:28:22.322\n&gt;&gt; I'll say, if at first you don't\nsucceed, try, try, try again [LAUGH].\n\n514\n00:28:22.322 --> 00:28:26.104\n&gt;&gt; You can see, as me, as your mascot\nright here is that I still trip over\n\n515\n00:28:26.104 --> 00:28:29.314\nmyself, and have to remind myself okay,\nwhat am I doing?\n\n516\n00:28:29.314 --> 00:28:31.926\nSlow down, remember what your syntax is,\n\n517\n00:28:31.926 --> 00:28:35.061\nuse the other ways that you\ncould go around things.\n\n518\n00:28:35.061 --> 00:28:38.018\nAnd so, It's okay,\nwe're all gonna do it, and you will too.\n\n519\n00:28:38.018 --> 00:28:40.378\nBut at least now, hopefully,\nwe have given you some tips and\n\n520\n00:28:40.378 --> 00:28:42.381\ntricks to help you make it\na little less stressful.\n\n521\n00:28:42.381 --> 00:28:45.252\n&gt;&gt; Well some definite words of\nencouragement there, Vonne.\n\n522\n00:28:45.252 --> 00:28:48.988\nI'm gonna try to internalize them, and\nuse them in my everyday practices, and\n\n523\n00:28:48.988 --> 00:28:50.120\nhopefully you will to.\n\n524\n00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:53.111\nAnd well, to get more of those tidbits\ncome on back for Excel functions, but\n\n525\n00:28:53.111 --> 00:28:55.561\nit does look like we're running\nout of time for this episode.\n\n526\n00:28:55.561 --> 00:28:59.084\nSo signing off for OfficePro.TV,\nI been your host, Justin Benison.\n\n527\n00:28:59.084 --> 00:28:59.755\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n528\n00:28:59.755 --> 00:29:00.999\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n529\n00:29:00.999 -->

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.580\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:15.711\nGreetings everyone and welcome back to\nanother exciting episode of Office Pro TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.711 --> 00:00:18.771\nI'm your host Justin Dennison, and\nwe're back with more Excel functions.\n\n4\n00:00:18.771 --> 00:00:22.820\nIn particular we're gonna be looking at\naverage, and average a, or average e.\n\n5\n00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.980\nI don't know luckily we'll have someone\nto set me right if I mispronounce that,\n\n6\n00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:27.820\nthe one and only Vonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.960\nHow are you doing today Vonne?\n\n8\n00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.080\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing pretty good yeah.\n\n9\n00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.880\nOur director Taylor said that one and\nI'm like you're reading average a,\n\n10\n00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.431\nand I'm like that's that's pretty funny.\n\n11\n00:00:38.431 --> 00:00:39.424\n[LAUGH] Yeah so\n\n12\n00:00:39.424 --> 00:00:43.156\nwe are gonna talk about those\nparticular functions in this episode.\n\n13\n00:00:43.156 --> 00:00:46.020\nSo why don't we go ahead and define and\n\n14\n00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.520\nsince you're a math person there Justin,\nwhat does average mean?\n\n15\n00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.450\n&gt;&gt; Well I'm gonna pretend\nI'm not a math person,\n\n16\n00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.440\nbecause this can get a little iffy.\n\n17\n00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.570\nAn average, you take all the numbers\nup and you add them together, and\n\n18\n00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.160\nthen you divide by how\nmany numbers you got.\n\n19\n00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.220\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n20\n00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.714\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think it's correct.\n\n21\n00:01:02.714 --> 00:01:03.860\n&gt;&gt; No, I know it's correct.\n\n22\n00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.290\nBut I also was doing a little pun there,\ndid you catch the pun?\n\n23\n00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.940\nWhat does average mean?\n\n24\n00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:11.760\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n25\n00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.615\n&gt;&gt; Is it-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry!\n\n26\n00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:14.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, but it gets weird,\n\n27\n00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.840\ncuz the mean can be a little shaky.\n\n28\n00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.130\nThey're all measures of central tendency.\n\n29\n00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.510\nBut typically, everyday speech, mean and\naverage mean exactly, are they exactly?\n\n30\n00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.630\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; For everyday conversations, mean and\n\n31\n00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.380\naverage mean, mean the same thing.\n\n32\n00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.390\n&gt;&gt; I know,\nit's like we're talking in circles.\n\n33\n00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.870\nAnd that's where,\nin my mathematical world,\n\n34\n00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.750\nthey do equal, the same thing.\n\n35\n00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.320\nBut as soon as you're like, yeah,\n\n36\n00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.610\nI'm like, wait, it means it can\ngo a little outside of that.\n\n37\n00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.110\nAnd you're just smiling over there.\n\n38\n00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.510\nI'm like, okay well anyways for\nus non-super mathematicians, yeah, we're\n\n39\n00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.280\ngonna take all of the numbers, and add\nthem up, and divide by how many we have.\n\n40\n00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.460\nOkay, that's great.\n\n41\n00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.880\nNow the cool thing is is\nwith the function called or\n\n42\n00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.150\nnamed average it does exactly that.\n\n43\n00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.980\nWe say performance function on this range\nitself, and it's going ahead and doing it.\n\n44\n00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.460\nSo why don't we jump in and\nshow you how it's done.\n\n45\n00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.100\nI have a file called average all,\n\n46\n00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.690\nbecause I'm going to be doing all the\naverage functions within this workbook.\n\n47\n00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.665\nI'm gonna start off with the first one.\n\n48\n00:02:21.665 --> 00:02:26.633\nOkay so what we have some Gainesville\ncats and we have some Jacksonville cats,\n\n49\n00:02:26.633 --> 00:02:27.550\njust random.\n\n50\n00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.259\nAnd these are the number of meows\nthat they maybe do in an hour, a day.\n\n51\n00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:36.480\nThey're just numbers that we\nwant to find the average.\n\n52\n00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.380\nOn average how many times do\nthe Gainesville cats meow?\n\n53\n00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.090\nSo just like our other functions\nthat we did with our sums and\n\n54\n00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.440\neverything we're going to\nstart from the very beginning.\n\n55\n00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.880\nI would say that average is\none of the basic functions.\n\n56\n00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.590\nYou're gonna add things up,\nyou're gonna sum things up,\n\n57\n00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.000\nyou're gonna count things up,\nthose types of things.\n\n58\n00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.750\nSo if it works the exact same way you\n\n59\n00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.700\nstart with where do I want the answer\nto my function, or evaluation to go.\n\n60\n00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.810\nSo I am selecting cell\nE4 Now you can go ahead and\n\n61\n00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.360\nput in functions multiple ways we've\ntalked about this, you could type it out.\n\n62\n00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.840\nYou can in this particular one you can\nuse the autosum with the drop down, or\n\n63\n00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.140\nwe can go ahead and\nuse the insert function dialogue box.\n\n64\n00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.200\nWe'll go through them just so\n\n65\n00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.590\nyou can go ahead see them because maybe\nyou haven't watched the other episodes.\n\n66\n00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.910\nSo Cell where I want\nthe answer to go into.\n\n67\n00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.970\nI'm gonna go into the formulas\ntab on the ribbon.\n\n68\n00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.250\nAnd I've collapsed this just to make it\na little bit easier to see everything.\n\n69\n00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.160\nAnd we go to insert function.\n\n70\n00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.650\nAnd then we can go ahead and find this.\n\n71\n00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.160\nNow I have looked for some sums,\nthat's why you see average and average if.\n\n72\n00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.771\nIf they're not in this dialog box,\nyou can always go ahead and type them in.\n\n73\n00:03:46.771 --> 00:03:50.645\nAnd then you could type in average,\nand then hit go, and\n\n74\n00:03:50.645 --> 00:03:52.630\nit should go ahead and find.\n\n75\n00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.323\nThere's my average, and\nthen I click OK, and\n\n76\n00:03:55.323 --> 00:03:58.660\nit gives me a description\nof what I'm supposed to do.\n\n77\n00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.180\nOkay, it returns the average, or\narithmic mean of its arguments.\n\n78\n00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.390\nWhich can be numbers names or age or\nreferences that contain numbers.\n\n79\n00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.610\nOkay, perfect, let's just go ahead and\nsay, add up all these numbers and\n\n80\n00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.430\ndivide by how many we have.\n\n81\n00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.110\nSo then you go ahead and\nfind the numbers that you want.\n\n82\n00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.800\nAs long as there's something here,\nnow notice that it's doing B4 through D4.\n\n83\n00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.410\nNope that's not it okay?\n\n84\n00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.520\nBecause it's trying to find something\nrelative to where I was when\n\n85\n00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.220\nI had my cell selected.\n\n86\n00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.536\nTrying to find stuff around it.\n\n87\n00:04:28.536 --> 00:04:31.980\nDon't worry that deposits\nsomething there that is wrong.\n\n88\n00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.930\nIt could be right,\nyou could be right next it and\n\n89\n00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.560\nbe like, that's exactly what I want,\ngreat wonderful.\n\n90\n00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.540\nI'm gonna hit the delete\nkey to go ahead and\n\n91\n00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.290\nget everything out cuz I tend to get in\nthis like, but it'll just replace it.\n\n92\n00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.350\nJust delete it okay?\n\n93\n00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:46.370\nGet rid of it,\n\n94\n00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.780\nhave your flashing cursor into the field\nthat you want your numbers to be in.\n\n95\n00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.610\nYou take your cursor,\nyour white selection, and\n\n96\n00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.950\nyou select the cells that\nyou would like to evaluate.\n\n97\n00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.770\nNow right now, I'm only averaging up the\nGainesville cats, that's all I want to do.\n\n98\n00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.440\nNotice, of course, you could do both.\n\n99\n00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.570\nThat's why I have Jacksonville and\nGainesville,\n\n100\n00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.020\nI want the average of all of our\nFlorida division or what have you.\n\n101\n00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.300\nSo I'm just going to use\none group of numbers.\n\n102\n00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.070\nYou can see that this is working because\nit's pulling the values out here.\n\n103\n00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.900\nIt's giving you the result here, it's 4.6.\n\n104\n00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.450\nYou click OK, and then there you go,\nthat's what I've got.\n\n105\n00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:30.030\nI've got the average meows for\nour cats in Gainesville has about.\n\n106\n00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.980\nWell, it is 4.6.\n\n107\n00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.370\nDo be careful about how\nthis cell is formatted.\n\n108\n00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.740\nIt might be formatted\ndifferently if you were doing,\n\n109\n00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.570\nsay, currency and this formatted as a\nnumber, you also have your decimal places.\n\n110\n00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.770\nWe've talked about this in other episodes,\nbut just be aware of that.\n\n111\n00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.970\nSo use the insert function dialog box,\ncool.\n\n112\n00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.880\nYou could also do the autosum but\nwe're not summing so\n\n113\n00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.430\nif I select the cell where I want my\nanswer to go into which is going to be E7.\n\n114\n00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.280\nWe go into formulas and actually we're\ngonna go over here to the home button just\n\n115\n00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.930\nbecause there's multiple\nplaces you can do it.\n\n116\n00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.120\nYou can go to Formulas,\nit's right there, or the Home.\n\n117\n00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.210\nAnd notice, if I click the button,\nright on, whoops.\n\n118\n00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.750\nI clicked the, here, let's go ahead and\ndouble-click on this, so\n\n119\n00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.430\nI can get this to be fully expanded.\n\n120\n00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.660\nIf I click on the button itself,\nit's going to perform the sum function.\n\n121\n00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.280\nBut if I click the drop down next to it,\nI can have some commonly\n\n122\n00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.900\nused functions that will automatically\npopulate, and everything's great.\n\n123\n00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.670\nSo if I click on Average,\nnotice that it's, again,\n\n124\n00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:40.620\ntrying to find values that are closest to\nyou, and that's not what I want, okay?\n\n125\n00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.530\nSo as long as you stay\nright where you're at,\n\n126\n00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.690\nyou take your mouse, you select the cells.\n\n127\n00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.700\nCuz these little ones now\nif you get too much and\n\n128\n00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.820\nyou're like oop that's not right, stop.\n\n129\n00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:55.700\nJust white plus sign, do not get the move,\nwhite plus and you go out and\n\n130\n00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.360\nselect or maybe wait that's supposed\nto be you know what that was not,\n\n131\n00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.040\nwere you waiting for me [LAUGH].\n\n132\n00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I was like Vonne,\n\n133\n00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.575\nVonne I think we're supposed\nto be doing Jacksonville now.\n\n134\n00:07:06.575 --> 00:07:11.611\n&gt;&gt; And great example of like I\nhad the wrong range of cells.\n\n135\n00:07:11.611 --> 00:07:12.460\nAs long as you get them.\n\n136\n00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:18.050\nNow if you get too far out of those and\nyou're like escape, abort, abort.\n\n137\n00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.700\nOkay you just hit the escape key okay and\nthen it can stop.\n\n138\n00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.980\nOr wherever you're at just hit enter,\ndelete it, and start over.\n\n139\n00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.660\nOkay all these things we\nhave talked about but\n\n140\n00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.770\nagain I'm just kind of doing some reviews.\n\n141\n00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.700\nCuz again if you were down here.\n\n142\n00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.361\nIf I was right here and I clicked\nthe auto average, drop down first,\n\n143\n00:07:33.361 --> 00:07:34.977\nthat's exactly what I want.\n\n144\n00:07:34.977 --> 00:07:39.334\nI can just hit enter and be done but\nI'm not, I'm over here and so\n\n145\n00:07:39.334 --> 00:07:43.569\nwe drop down, average,\npick the ones that we want.\n\n146\n00:07:43.569 --> 00:07:46.129\nHit enter when we're done okay?\n\n147\n00:07:46.129 --> 00:07:47.585\nAnd now I get 4.2.\n\n148\n00:07:47.585 --> 00:07:52.010\nSo you can see that the cats in\nGainesville meow just a little bit more on\n\n149\n00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:52.689\naverage.\n\n150\n00:07:53.849 --> 00:07:56.596\nSo now I can go ahead and type this in.\n\n151\n00:07:56.596 --> 00:08:00.403\nNow Either way when you're using the\ninsert function dialog box you saw that\n\n152\n00:08:00.403 --> 00:08:02.850\nthere was two places where we could do it.\n\n153\n00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:06.266\nOr doing the auto average we could\nuse the command key to select\n\n154\n00:08:06.266 --> 00:08:08.180\nmultiple ranges of cells, okay?\n\n155\n00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.030\nSo we're gonna kind of\ncombine all of them.\n\n156\n00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:14.820\nWe can start off by typing equals cuz we\nknow all of our functions start with that.\n\n157\n00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:15.700\nWe type in average.\n\n158\n00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:20.090\nAs soon as I start typing it's going\nto start eliminating some of them.\n\n159\n00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:22.638\nSo if I want this one I hit the tab key.\n\n160\n00:08:22.638 --> 00:08:25.780\n[LAUGH] It's funny because it's been\na while since I've actually typed it.\n\n161\n00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.210\nI'm like is it the spacebar,\nis it the tab,\n\n162\n00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:31.410\nno I wanna automatically complete that.\n\n163\n00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:32.910\nSo now it goes ahead and\ngives me that function.\n\n164\n00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:39.070\nAnd now I have, with my flashing cursor\nhere, what do you want to average up?\n\n165\n00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:41.660\nSo then I take my selector.\n\n166\n00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:44.170\nClick hold and drag down,\nselect all of those.\n\n167\n00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:45.440\nBut I also want these.\n\n168\n00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:50.680\nSo just select a multiple range of cells,\nyou hold the command key.\n\n169\n00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.810\nNo this is, I'm sorry,\nthis is Windows, isn't it?\n\n170\n00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:54.200\nSorry, I've been teaching so\n\n171\n00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.730\nmuch in Mac lately that I just realized\nthat, did I say that before, too?\n\n172\n00:08:57.730 --> 00:08:58.250\nDid I say command?\n\n173\n00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:00.120\n&gt;&gt; No, I don't think so.\n\n174\n00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.629\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Not that I remember, but\n\n175\n00:09:01.629 --> 00:09:06.255\nI might've been really focused on we\nwere getting ready to misreport data so.\n\n176\n00:09:06.255 --> 00:09:09.090\n[LAUGH] I make no claims that I'm correct.\n\n177\n00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.940\n&gt;&gt; I am in the PC world\nright now it is control.\n\n178\n00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.453\nControl will go ahead and\n\n179\n00:09:14.453 --> 00:09:18.280\nallow you to select multiple\nranges of non-contiguous data.\n\n180\n00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:23.418\nSo I apologize if I was saying command,\nlike I said I've been in the MAC world for\n\n181\n00:09:23.418 --> 00:09:26.810\nquite a few weeks,\na couple of months actually now.\n\n182\n00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:29.480\nSo now we've got this, I'm done.\n\n183\n00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:34.323\nTo really make sure that you\nare completing the exercise you do need to\n\n184\n00:09:34.323 --> 00:09:38.110\ndo a completed parentheses,\nthis is what I've got.\n\n185\n00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:43.070\nIt color codes my ranges,\nI hit Enter, and now I have 4.4.\n\n186\n00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:44.730\nOkay, pretty good, right?\n\n187\n00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.290\nAny questions so far, Justin,\npretty straightforward?\n\n188\n00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:49.290\n&gt;&gt; Pretty straightforward,\nbut I do have a question.\n\n189\n00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:53.300\nWhat if I hit equals average, just\nleave the parentheses open and closed?\n\n190\n00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.491\nDoes it give me an actual error, or\n\n191\n00:09:55.491 --> 00:09:58.900\ndoes it report there's\nnothing divided by nothing?\n\n192\n00:09:58.900 --> 00:09:59.900\nDoes it-\n&gt;&gt; Like this?\n\n193\n00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.640\n&gt;&gt; How does it report,\nhow do I know that that's my error?\n\n194\n00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.560\nYep.\n&gt;&gt; That's where I'm done.\n\n195\n00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.250\nIt's gonna say there's a problem, okay.\n\n196\n00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:13.280\nYou get this there's a problem\nin many different places, okay.\n\n197\n00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.860\nSo it's like, okay, well, maybe it's this.\n\n198\n00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:21.048\nDid you type, so it's kind of\ngiving a very generic error message\n\n199\n00:10:21.048 --> 00:10:25.070\nthat doesn't always tell you\nexactly what you did wrong.\n\n200\n00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:29.860\nOkay, so you would just OK, and\nthen it says, no you have to do something.\n\n201\n00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.410\nNow, notice down here we could\ngo ahead and click this button.\n\n202\n00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:37.880\nBut I don't have anything in there so\nit doesn't really do anything until you\n\n203\n00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:42.100\nactually get in to say, for example here,\noops, hit got the wrong one.\n\n204\n00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:50.610\nSo if I was here, now it's going to\nhighlight the expressions, okay?\n\n205\n00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:53.950\nOr the range of cells that I have,\nthat's after you've done it.\n\n206\n00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:56.070\nSo yeah, you can't average nothing,\nbasically.\n\n207\n00:10:56.070 --> 00:11:01.770\nWhich kind of kind of comes, slightly\ncomes around to these are all numbers.\n\n208\n00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:05.095\nWe were just doing episodes right\nbefore this about data types in\n\n209\n00:11:05.095 --> 00:11:07.780\nprogramming languages and everything.\n\n210\n00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:12.440\nYou can evaluate numbers, you can go ahead\nand average them, but what about text?\n\n211\n00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:17.514\nWhat about if here Pumpkin,\nokay, he was having a bad day,\n\n212\n00:11:17.514 --> 00:11:21.780\nhe didn't meow at all, he went to 0 right?\n\n213\n00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:26.810\nSo in this sense, when it's 0 it's\nstill adding all of these up, and\n\n214\n00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:29.190\ndividing by 5, right?\n\n215\n00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:32.370\nBecause it's saying there\nare five entries in here, and so\n\n216\n00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:35.390\nthe Gainesville Meow goes through 3.8.\n\n217\n00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:40.730\nThe average has gone down because Pumpkin\ndid a big old goose egg right here.\n\n218\n00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:44.710\nWell, what if I typed in N/A?\n\n219\n00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:48.766\nMaybe in our,\nI can't use the slash properly.\n\n220\n00:11:48.766 --> 00:11:52.220\n[LAUGH] Maybe in the way\nthat we are reporting data,\n\n221\n00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:56.450\nif you don't have any sales or\nmeows, you get a big old N/A.\n\n222\n00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:59.320\nAnd if I hit Enter, look at what\nthat number did there, Justin.\n\n223\n00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:04.800\nNow I know you can do enough numbers\nin your head, so you can see it again,\n\n224\n00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.723\nokay so 0, 3.8.\n\n225\n00:12:07.723 --> 00:12:11.240\nN/A and it went to 4.75.\n\n226\n00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.520\nDo you know what it's doing?\n\n227\n00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:18.030\n&gt;&gt; So those numbers added together\nare 19 divided by 4, yeah, 4.75.\n\n228\n00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:22.808\nSo it did 19 divided by 4, so\nit just more or less skipped that entry.\n\n229\n00:12:22.808 --> 00:12:26.172\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's saying that I don't\nunderstand what this is, but\n\n230\n00:12:26.172 --> 00:12:27.320\nthere are five cats.\n\n231\n00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.529\nSo really in the way that we're reporting,\n\n232\n00:12:30.529 --> 00:12:34.790\nN/A it's not applicable,\nthat's really 0 isn't it?\n\n233\n00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:40.110\nOkay, so\nwhy isn't it doing the whole divide by 5?\n\n234\n00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:42.849\nBecause this particular function,\n\n235\n00:12:42.849 --> 00:12:46.480\nthe average function will\nonly look at numbers.\n\n236\n00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.725\nIf it sees text it just skips it, and\n\n237\n00:12:49.725 --> 00:12:55.580\ncompletely ignores it, and\nsays I only have four numbers.\n\n238\n00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:58.680\nI'm gonna add up the four numbers,\nand I'm gonna divide by 4.\n\n239\n00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.920\nNot add this up and divide this by 5,\ntreating this as a 0.\n\n240\n00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.790\nDoes that make sense?\n\n241\n00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:09.415\nSo what you can do,\nthere's another function.\n\n242\n00:13:09.415 --> 00:13:10.577\nAveragea, right?\n\n243\n00:13:10.577 --> 00:13:13.040\n[LAUGH] The average a.\n\n244\n00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:17.600\nOkay, this is just like your counts and\neverything, count versus count a.\n\n245\n00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:21.430\nA to me means all, everything.\n\n246\n00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:24.070\nIt's going to count text.\n\n247\n00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:27.280\nSo this is weird because now you're kind\nof mixing two different data types, right?\n\n248\n00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.710\nIt's like you can't average text, right?\n\n249\n00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:32.170\nI mean,\nwe just got finished talking about this.\n\n250\n00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:34.850\nBut what is it going to do?\n\n251\n00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:37.389\nWhat it does and\nhow I'm going to edit this formula by\n\n252\n00:13:37.389 --> 00:13:40.400\nthe way is I'm going to click on\nthe cell that has the formula.\n\n253\n00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.028\nI'm gonna come up to my formula bar and\n\n254\n00:13:43.028 --> 00:13:47.310\nI'm just going to change the name\nof the formula to average a.\n\n255\n00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:52.631\nAnd what it does is it's\ngoing to evaluate and\n\n256\n00:13:52.631 --> 00:13:57.740\nwhat it says is that this becomes text.\n\n257\n00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:02.870\nAnd it sees it so\nnow it's going back and making this 3.8.\n\n258\n00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:07.635\nWhich was what we had, okay.\n\n259\n00:14:07.635 --> 00:14:09.970\nBut let's do this, okay, so if I did here.\n\n260\n00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:15.380\nIf I did average,\nlet's go back to average, and select this.\n\n261\n00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:17.210\nSo we can kind of compare and contrast.\n\n262\n00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:19.259\nRight now, the average is 4.5.\n\n263\n00:14:19.259 --> 00:14:22.880\nWith average a, it's 3.8, okay?\n\n264\n00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.380\nBack if I did this, and\ntyped this into 0, now they equal.\n\n265\n00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:32.080\nSo what do you think it does with average\na, how does it treat the text right there?\n\n266\n00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.824\n&gt;&gt; I'm guessing it just says the value\nthat I'm going to sum up is 0, but\n\n267\n00:14:34.824 --> 00:14:36.370\nI'm also going to increase the count.\n\n268\n00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:40.890\nI'm gonna go ahead and count this record\nas part of the averaging process.\n\n269\n00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:47.060\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yes, so I will take any\ntext value, I'm going to equal it to 0.\n\n270\n00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:50.090\nAnd then I'm going to add\nit as one of my entries.\n\n271\n00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:51.470\nSo it's not gonna be 4, it's gonna be 5.\n\n272\n00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:55.911\nAnd that's where these\nare very different results\n\n273\n00:14:55.911 --> 00:15:00.070\nbased on how it's going\nto treat your text.\n\n274\n00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:06.276\nOkay, so that way if you ever have\nany mixed matched data types N/A or\n\n275\n00:15:06.276 --> 00:15:10.556\nnone, or you type in goose egg or\nwhat have you,\n\n276\n00:15:10.556 --> 00:15:14.410\nthat text will equal 0 in how it averages.\n\n277\n00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:18.256\n&gt;&gt; Now the selection of these respective\nfunctions this seems to be very specific\n\n278\n00:15:18.256 --> 00:15:19.140\nto your use case.\n\n279\n00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:23.640\nCuz I could think of times where if I\ndo not hand reported data, right, N/A.\n\n280\n00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.887\nI don't wanna count it\nas part of the average,\n\n281\n00:15:25.887 --> 00:15:28.840\nbecause I know that it's gonna\ndrive it down artificially.\n\n282\n00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:32.611\nSo I'm guessing, picking whether\nyou use average or average a,\n\n283\n00:15:32.611 --> 00:15:36.210\nis gonna be dependent on\nyour respective use case.\n\n284\n00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:40.155\nAlso that makes me think,\nare there any times where whatever we\n\n285\n00:15:40.155 --> 00:15:44.931\ntyped in there could possibly lead to\nsome odd instances of data reporting?\n\n286\n00:15:44.931 --> 00:15:49.741\n&gt;&gt; You must do some of this stuff on your\nown or you looked at the show notes again,\n\n287\n00:15:49.741 --> 00:15:53.310\nwhich is true,\ntrue [LAUGH] because there's something.\n\n288\n00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:57.073\nNot to get too far off the topic,\nBoolean, right?\n\n289\n00:15:57.073 --> 00:16:00.780\nCan you expand on Boolean there, Justin?\n\n290\n00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:05.045\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think of Boolean as\nthe answer to a question, of yes or\n\n291\n00:16:05.045 --> 00:16:08.007\nno questions, or it's on or off, right?\n\n292\n00:16:08.007 --> 00:16:12.807\nThat light is either on These lights are\non or they're off, it's not Now you can\n\n293\n00:16:12.807 --> 00:16:17.400\nargue that there's a dimmer switch,\nbut we're gonna say standard.\n\n294\n00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:21.470\nSo any time I think of Boolean, if I\never have to ask myself a question about\n\n295\n00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:25.540\nthe data,\nlike does this equal four, right?\n\n296\n00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.330\nThat's a yes or no question.\n\n297\n00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:32.220\nIf that's a yes or no question, then I'm\ngoing to get a true for yes or a false for\n\n298\n00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:34.960\nno, and that's an on or off.\n\n299\n00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:39.340\nI'm guessing in Excel it can\nalso be maybe a zero or a one?\n\n300\n00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:42.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well as soon as you start\nGosh I looked too far into the lights,\n\n301\n00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:43.860\nI'm blinded now.\n\n302\n00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:46.950\nBut yes the whole lights are on,\nthe lights are off,\n\n303\n00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:49.350\nand if you get down into binary right?\n\n304\n00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:53.160\nThe electrical switch is on or\nit's off, and what's binary?\n\n305\n00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.270\nOne and zero.\n\n306\n00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:57.560\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; One and five Vonne, one and five.\n\n307\n00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.534\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it's either on or off, so\n\n308\n00:16:59.534 --> 00:17:02.421\nif it's on it's true, it equals one, and\n\n309\n00:17:02.421 --> 00:17:07.877\nthat's exactly what it's going to do here,\nis that there are reserved words and\n\n310\n00:17:07.877 --> 00:17:11.920\nI think this is really more\nalmost like general computing.\n\n311\n00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:15.888\nIt's not really totally\nexclusive to Excel,\n\n312\n00:17:15.888 --> 00:17:21.290\nthis is everywhere really,\ntrue equals 1, false equals 0.\n\n313\n00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:25.576\nSo if I came in,\nlet's come back to this example,\n\n314\n00:17:25.576 --> 00:17:30.480\nif I typed in true,\ndo you see how that value changed?\n\n315\n00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.430\nIt went up to four.\n\n316\n00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:32.945\nThat didn't do anything, right?\n\n317\n00:17:32.945 --> 00:17:37.630\nCuz again, average doesn't look at text,\nbut it looked at here and said it.\n\n318\n00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:40.221\nNow if I typed back N/A,\nit goes back to 3.8.\n\n319\n00:17:40.221 --> 00:17:46.660\nIf I type in False, then it's gonna\nsay the same because it's still zero.\n\n320\n00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:48.280\nFalse is zero.\n\n321\n00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.280\nN/A is zero.\n\n322\n00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:54.320\nThe only time it's going to be\ndifferent is if you change it to true,\n\n323\n00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:57.880\nwhich is a little strange.\n\n324\n00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.520\nI wouldn't say strange,\nit totally makers sense to me,\n\n325\n00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:05.630\nhow many times am I going\nto type in the word true?\n\n326\n00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:11.168\nI mean, we're talking about in real world\nsituations, it's probably gonna be none,\n\n327\n00:18:11.168 --> 00:18:15.180\nN/A, void, those types of things\nif were talking business wise.\n\n328\n00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.627\nAnd like you said,\n\n329\n00:18:16.627 --> 00:18:22.603\nyou're going to have to evaluate how you\ntreat a nothing value, a zero value.\n\n330\n00:18:22.603 --> 00:18:24.220\nDo you eliminate it?\n\n331\n00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:28.270\nOr do you include it to\nadjust your numbers.\n\n332\n00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:31.702\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and we're not talking cooking\nbooks here, just so we're clear.\n\n333\n00:18:31.702 --> 00:18:34.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Did you see me kinda stop on that one?\n\n334\n00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:35.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was like uh-oh, uh-oh.\n\n335\n00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:38.372\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But in all seriousness knowing about\n\n336\n00:18:38.372 --> 00:18:42.740\nthis true reserved word this could\nsave you some heartache right?\n\n337\n00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:46.220\nIf you're collecting data then you\njust change how you collect the data\n\n338\n00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:50.850\nnecessary so you can say,\nwell I need average, or average A.\n\n339\n00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:53.120\nWe don't have this reserve word True,\n\n340\n00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.730\nbecause if that's accidentally in\nthere and you haven't planned for\n\n341\n00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:59.210\nit, well that could drastically\nchange your respective results.\n\n342\n00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:03.490\nNow, if you're talking thousands of rows,\nit might not seem like a big deal, but\n\n343\n00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:05.710\nif you have 300 trues in there, and\n\n344\n00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:09.560\nreally what it meant was,\ndo you not want to answer true?\n\n345\n00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:12.247\nSomebody worded a question wrong,\nor something like that,\n\n346\n00:19:12.247 --> 00:19:15.894\nthen you have a misrepresentation of what\nyou're actually trying to calculate.\n\n347\n00:19:15.894 --> 00:19:20.439\nNow Vonne we've seen average, and average\nA, at least initially, are there any other\n\n348\n00:19:20.439 --> 00:19:24.230\nthings that we need to be aware of\nto think about before we head out?\n\n349\n00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:25.340\n&gt;&gt; Honestly, no.\n\n350\n00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:27.350\nI mean an average is an average.\n\n351\n00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:31.030\nI think the examples that we're giving in\nreal world situations of how you have to\n\n352\n00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:34.812\nunderstand what your numbers\nmean is the biggest part of it.\n\n353\n00:19:34.812 --> 00:19:38.594\nSome variations on just\nthe basic function of average,\n\n354\n00:19:38.594 --> 00:19:42.373\nin the sum episodes we did like\nthe sum and I think sum if,\n\n355\n00:19:42.373 --> 00:19:48.006\nI did some other examples of where we use\ndifferent operators, like greater than or\n\n356\n00:19:48.006 --> 00:19:53.906\nequal to, but that's more of the ifs, that\nwe're gonna get into in the next episode.\n\n357\n00:19:53.906 --> 00:19:57.290\nBut definitely go back and\ncheck out the episodes on sum,\n\n358\n00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:01.592\nbecause if you're taking a range of\nnumbers instead of adding them up and\n\n359\n00:20:01.592 --> 00:20:06.850\nyou want to average them, you just change\nout where I put sum and put average.\n\n360\n00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:09.470\nAnd then you can get some\ndifferent variations on it and\n\n361\n00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:11.140\njust different ways to\nthink about your numbers.\n\n362\n00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:15.420\nSo I would say as a suggestion go and\ncheck those episodes out and\n\n363\n00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:19.170\nsee how you can just kind of\ninsert a different function and\n\n364\n00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:20.620\naverage, instead of summing it up.\n\n365\n00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.730\nBut that's all I have for\nthis episode, but\n\n366\n00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:27.072\nwe have some more with some if\nstatements coming up after this.\n\n367\n00:20:27.072 --> 00:20:28.703\n&gt;&gt; Logic and averaging.\n\n368\n00:20:28.703 --> 00:20:31.550\nI tell you what, you don't want to\nmiss it, so definitely come on back.\n\n369\n00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:33.130\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of there.\n\n370\n00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:36.030\nSo signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n371\n00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:36.810\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n372\n00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:40.159\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:16.950\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n4\n00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.680\nAnd we're back at you with\nmore Excel functions and well,\n\n5\n00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.060\nwe're gonna be talking about\nAVERAGEIFs and AVERAGEIFS.\n\n6\n00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.510\nI put an S on both of those.\n\n7\n00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.730\nThere's actually two\ndifferent functions there.\n\n8\n00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.640\nAnd this is something that's\ngonna help us out, but\n\n9\n00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.065\nI don't wanna steal her thunder because we\nhave a special guest in studio with us.\n\n10\n00:00:33.065 --> 00:00:34.257\nMiss Vonne Smith,\nhow're you doing today, Vonne?\n\n11\n00:00:34.257 --> 00:00:35.182\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing pretty good.\n\n12\n00:00:35.182 --> 00:00:36.035\nHow're you doing?\n\n13\n00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:37.105\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic.\n\n14\n00:00:37.105 --> 00:00:40.445\nNow on a previous episode we\ntalked about average and AVERAGEA.\n\n15\n00:00:40.445 --> 00:00:44.625\nOr average A as some other people call it,\nwe had a little fun there.\n\n16\n00:00:44.625 --> 00:00:46.335\nBut average if and average ifs,\n\n17\n00:00:46.335 --> 00:00:50.275\nI'm guessing, we're gonna add a little\nlogic to our averaging, right?\n\n18\n00:00:50.275 --> 00:00:54.538\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nit is perform an average on said group of\n\n19\n00:00:54.538 --> 00:00:58.927\nnumbers Only if it meets the criteria,\nokay.\n\n20\n00:00:58.927 --> 00:01:03.059\nSo we have some different samples,\nmaybe we have multiple stores and\n\n21\n00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.279\nI wanna take in it all in one big list.\n\n22\n00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:09.080\nAnd I wanna say okay,\nif I wanna average the sales,\n\n23\n00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.410\nthat will be only if the store\nin another column equals Pinto.\n\n24\n00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.602\nOr what if I wanted, that's just one if,\nthat's one condition.\n\n25\n00:01:18.602 --> 00:01:23.332\nWhat if, okay, well it has to\nbe in the Gainesville store, and\n\n26\n00:01:23.332 --> 00:01:26.028\nonly if it's after a certain date.\n\n27\n00:01:26.028 --> 00:01:27.647\nWell, then that's two criterias.\n\n28\n00:01:27.647 --> 00:01:32.599\nSo if would be a single criteria,\nifs would be multiple, and\n\n29\n00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:35.424\nyou could have as many as you want.\n\n30\n00:01:35.424 --> 00:01:39.739\nAnd this is where like if you looked\nat the formula by itself it's like man,\n\n31\n00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:44.630\nthat looks super complicated,\nI wouldn't even know how to type that in.\n\n32\n00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.920\nI will honestly say I would\nagree with you there.\n\n33\n00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.220\nIf I had to type it in by myself,\n\n34\n00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.250\neven with some of the helpings it\nmight get a little confusing honestly.\n\n35\n00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.030\nSo for these two functions,\n\n36\n00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.060\nI'm going to highly suggest that you\nuse the inter function dialogue box.\n\n37\n00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.180\nBecause it gives you just like step by\nstep, it explains what you're supposed to\n\n38\n00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.320\ndo, and it just makes them a little\neasier to kind of compartmentalized and\n\n39\n00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.210\nknow what place I'm supposed to put what.\n\n40\n00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.170\nWhere do I average my numbers,\nand where do I put the criteria.\n\n41\n00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.600\nOkay, so yes,\nyou could totally type it out, no problem.\n\n42\n00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.970\nI'm not going to because I\nthink it's a little bit easier.\n\n43\n00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.800\nSo, and I try to take the path of least\nresistance and make it to where it doesn't\n\n44\n00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.200\nhurt my brain too much, so\nthat's what we're going to be doing.\n\n45\n00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.610\nSo yep, it's just averaging on\ncriterias and that's really it.\n\n46\n00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.410\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne, there's nothing\nwrong with being a little lazy.\n\n47\n00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.880\nGoodness knows that I'm lazy when\nit comes to things like this,\n\n48\n00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.140\nso it's perfectly okay.\n\n49\n00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.360\nNow the one thing about that average\nifs and you can definitely say well,\n\n50\n00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.320\nwe'll see that a little bit later.\n\n51\n00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.540\nIt has to meet all of the criteria or\nnothing, right?\n\n52\n00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.560\nLike it either is or isn't, there's\nno kind of in between there, right?\n\n53\n00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.441\n&gt;&gt; Correct and the range of cells\nthat you're gonna be averaging,\n\n54\n00:02:56.441 --> 00:02:58.997\nif it doesn't meet that criteria or\nyou type it in wrong,\n\n55\n00:02:58.997 --> 00:03:02.170\nit's just gonna like, all right,\nI'm just gonna average all of it.\n\n56\n00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.960\nIt kinda just like ignores the if part of\nit, and will still perform your average.\n\n57\n00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.063\nSo that's something you do need to watch.\n\n58\n00:03:09.063 --> 00:03:12.849\nKinda be aware of your data and\nbe like, is that right?\n\n59\n00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.910\n[LAUGH] So be careful on this.\n\n60\n00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.670\nAnd now we're doing a very\nsmall amount of data.\n\n61\n00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.540\nSmaller ranges so we can get this\nconcept when you start getting into\n\n62\n00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.210\nhundreds of thousands of rows.\n\n63\n00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.998\nYeah, that's where you have gonna have\nto trust it and hope you did it right.\n\n64\n00:03:29.998 --> 00:03:33.967\nAnd that where maybe even doing like\na little example on like a smaller set to\n\n65\n00:03:33.967 --> 00:03:37.244\nmake sure is this working,\nyep, it's working, I'm good.\n\n66\n00:03:37.244 --> 00:03:40.147\nIf it's working here,\nit should work in the other place.\n\n67\n00:03:40.147 --> 00:03:43.595\nBut we're doing a lot like [LAUGH] ifs,\nright, [LAUGH]\n\n68\n00:03:43.595 --> 00:03:46.498\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, famous last words.\n\n69\n00:03:46.498 --> 00:03:47.161\n&gt;&gt; Should.\n\n70\n00:03:47.161 --> 00:03:49.707\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz should followed by anything.\n\n71\n00:03:49.707 --> 00:03:52.555\nIt works, it should work,\ndoesn't work, look at that.\n\n72\n00:03:52.555 --> 00:03:54.059\n&gt;&gt; With a bunch of astericks after it.\n\n73\n00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.862\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n74\n00:03:54.862 --> 00:03:57.912\n&gt;&gt; That has no place of\nwhere the astericks are.\n\n75\n00:03:57.912 --> 00:04:00.302\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit's footnotes without actual footnotes.\n\n76\n00:04:00.302 --> 00:04:02.040\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, [LAUGH].\n\n77\n00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.170\nAll right, well,\nwhy don't we come in to our file?\n\n78\n00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.940\nIt's the same file that I was just doing\nin average that's why I've left it\n\n79\n00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.740\non the average and average A.\n\n80\n00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:12.908\nAverage if.\n\n81\n00:04:12.908 --> 00:04:13.630\nWell, there we go.\n\n82\n00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:14.990\nLet's move all over to here.\n\n83\n00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.680\nSo we have some categories, unit prices.\n\n84\n00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.550\nThis looks familiar?\n\n85\n00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.238\nYeah, I use a lot this same\ndata in a lot of my episodes.\n\n86\n00:04:22.238 --> 00:04:25.280\nSo I've got a category,\nunit price, quantity and total.\n\n87\n00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.138\nNow these totals are in itself,\ntheir own, formulas, sorry.\n\n88\n00:04:31.138 --> 00:04:35.049\nI was trying to say functions because this\nis just a take the cell times the cell, so\n\n89\n00:04:35.049 --> 00:04:37.120\nthat would be a formula.\n\n90\n00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:43.680\nSo if I wanted to average the sales but\nonly of the category of clothing.\n\n91\n00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.240\nOkay, cuz if I went ahead and\nselected all of these and\n\n92\n00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.430\ndid average all these cells,\nIt's gonna give me all of them.\n\n93\n00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.290\nOkay but no, only if in this\ncolumn it's in clothing, and\n\n94\n00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.230\nyes I did sort them, okay, just to\nmake it a little easier for ourselves.\n\n95\n00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.359\nSo I really only wanna grab these, and\nhonestly I know the answer right now.\n\n96\n00:05:01.359 --> 00:05:05.186\nBecause down here in the status\nbar the average is 53 40.\n\n97\n00:05:05.186 --> 00:05:08.930\nThis is another way of okay\nlike am I close to it?\n\n98\n00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.950\nAll right when it's this simple,\nit's a little nice to check yourself.\n\n99\n00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:18.980\nOkay so this is where I want to\nhave the answer to my question.\n\n100\n00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.370\nI want the function,\nthe answer to go here.\n\n101\n00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.780\nSo we're gonna use the formulas\ntab on the ribbon,\n\n102\n00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.430\nwe're gonna go to the insert\nfunction cuz it's so much easier.\n\n103\n00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.080\n&gt;&gt; You could type it in, I already\nhave it down here for average if but,\n\n104\n00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.590\nagain just type in average if and\nclick go.\n\n105\n00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.880\nBecause, honestly, I don't even\nremember what category it's in,\n\n106\n00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.445\nI want to say it's probably in statistical\nbecause that's where it's going to be,\n\n107\n00:05:43.445 --> 00:05:45.940\nyep, it is, okay, good job [LAUGH] But\n\n108\n00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.100\nI don't remember all the categories,\ntype it, make it easier on yourself.\n\n109\n00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.630\nSo let's go with average if, we click OK.\n\n110\n00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.824\nAnd this is where you do have to\nread the dialog box and I'm gonna\n\n111\n00:05:58.824 --> 00:06:05.402\nclick on each one of these before we even\nstart because to me, it's backwards.\n\n112\n00:06:05.402 --> 00:06:07.080\nSo it's saying range.\n\n113\n00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.980\nIs the range of cells you want evaluated?\n\n114\n00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.570\nTo me, I would think, well,\n\n115\n00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.520\nI want to evaluate the average\nof these totals, right?\n\n116\n00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.150\nThat's not it.\n\n117\n00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.890\nLet's go through it.\n\n118\n00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:25.180\nCriteria, the criteria is the condition or\ncriteria in the form of a number.\n\n119\n00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.490\nExpression text that defines which\ncells will be used to find the average.\n\n120\n00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.390\nI know, keep going this will\nmake it a little easier.\n\n121\n00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:39.700\nAverage the actual cells to\nbe used to find the average.\n\n122\n00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:47.296\nSo this part, the range of numbers\nthat I want to average are the totals.\n\n123\n00:06:47.296 --> 00:06:54.971\nThe range of cells that that I want you\nto look at as the criteria is Column A.\n\n124\n00:06:54.971 --> 00:06:59.877\nAnd then the criteria itself\nwould be the value of clothing.\n\n125\n00:06:59.877 --> 00:07:02.964\nAnd so, it's a little, it's kinda hard,\n\n126\n00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:06.981\ncuz I can see Justin's face\nover here going wait, what?\n\n127\n00:07:06.981 --> 00:07:09.100\nI'm a little, it's backwards right?\n\n128\n00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.391\n&gt;&gt; That wording is not super clear because\nthat's not out of our criteria would have\n\n129\n00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:17.194\nbeen, I don't know, like some kind\nof expression or, I don't know.\n\n130\n00:07:17.194 --> 00:07:19.870\nLike that's not how I\nwould have read that.\n\n131\n00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.056\n&gt;&gt; And it could be an expression\nas in like greater than or\n\n132\n00:07:22.056 --> 00:07:23.523\nequal to 20 something like that.\n\n133\n00:07:23.523 --> 00:07:25.050\nIt totally could be that, too.\n\n134\n00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:30.058\nAnd that where it's like it's helping,\nbut it's a little slightly\n\n135\n00:07:30.058 --> 00:07:35.080\nconfusing especially for\nyour programatic and mathematical mind.\n\n136\n00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.968\nYou're like that's a little weird.\n\n137\n00:07:36.968 --> 00:07:41.660\nSo just know and\nthat's why we go through this,\n\n138\n00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:48.250\nyou put the range of the category or\ncriteria here.\n\n139\n00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:51.420\nSo watch I'm going to put\nmy cursor in this field.\n\n140\n00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:56.055\nI am going to select A2, I'm going\nto scroll down I'm going to hold my\n\n141\n00:07:56.055 --> 00:07:59.294\nshift key and click down here so\nthis is my range.\n\n142\n00:07:59.294 --> 00:08:03.270\nI did not bring in the headings\nCould you bring in the headings?\n\n143\n00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:09.632\nYes, keep that thought for just a second,\nbut I just want to evaluate the data.\n\n144\n00:08:09.632 --> 00:08:14.467\nSo look at this column and\nthen what is the criteria?\n\n145\n00:08:14.467 --> 00:08:17.910\nWe are saying that we want\nthe average sales of clothing.\n\n146\n00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:19.840\nSo clothing would be the criteria.\n\n147\n00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.670\nIn this particular range, find this value.\n\n148\n00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:26.420\nI could physically type in clothing,\nwhoops,\n\n149\n00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.070\nmake sure you actually\nmatch it right there.\n\n150\n00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.690\nI could say, find clothing.\n\n151\n00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:32.470\nNothing wrong with that.\n\n152\n00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:35.630\nBut I also have it here.\n\n153\n00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:39.450\nMake sure you delete that I have it\nright here, and that does match,\n\n154\n00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:40.710\nthis the cell value.\n\n155\n00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:42.870\nSo I could use a cell reference, and\n\n156\n00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:46.830\nnotice that it is just putting\nin clothing as the criteria.\n\n157\n00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:51.760\nOkay, so hard code or cell reference.\n\n158\n00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.690\nWhat am I actually averaging?\n\n159\n00:08:55.690 --> 00:09:03.961\nCursor in that field I am averaging\nfrom D2 down through hold shift, D21.\n\n160\n00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:07.719\nAnd I can see that looks about right,\n53, 40, and\n\n161\n00:09:07.719 --> 00:09:13.472\nwe saw when we selected those values down\nin the status bar that that's what I want.\n\n162\n00:09:13.472 --> 00:09:17.717\nThere you go, you click OK,\nand that's the answer, okay?\n\n163\n00:09:17.717 --> 00:09:23.765\nSo give me the average of the sales\nbased on if they are clothing,\n\n164\n00:09:23.765 --> 00:09:27.685\nnot accessories, not food, not toys and\n\n165\n00:09:27.685 --> 00:09:32.400\nthen that's how you can do the average if,\nokay.\n\n166\n00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:37.104\nAnd if I changed this, this is where even\nthe cell reference is connected by typed\n\n167\n00:09:37.104 --> 00:09:38.915\nin toys and that would change.\n\n168\n00:09:38.915 --> 00:09:45.840\nOkay, if I typed in Justine,\nthat thing I don't understand it.\n\n169\n00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.590\nSo it actually does give you\nan error on this particular one.\n\n170\n00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:51.650\nI have seen it to where I'm just like, no,\nI'm just gonna go ahead and average it.\n\n171\n00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:56.230\nSo that might be in the Mac world,\nhonestly I can't remember where I saw it.\n\n172\n00:09:56.230 --> 00:10:01.070\nBut just in case it might give you\nthis like, hm, I don't understand, or\n\n173\n00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.410\nit could just give you a number\nthat doesn't mean anything.\n\n174\n00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:07.368\nThat doesn't actually meet the criteria,\nso\n\n175\n00:10:07.368 --> 00:10:11.437\nkeep it open, and\njust know you need to type it.\n\n176\n00:10:11.437 --> 00:10:12.136\nDoes that make your?\n\n177\n00:10:12.136 --> 00:10:16.414\n&gt;&gt; That makes a lot more sense,\nand I'm kinda thinking,\n\n178\n00:10:16.414 --> 00:10:20.044\nthis one column is more or\nless a mask, right?\n\n179\n00:10:20.044 --> 00:10:22.419\nIf it matches these for the criteria,\n\n180\n00:10:22.419 --> 00:10:27.480\nthen only those are seen from underneath\nyou can kind of think of them as cut outs.\n\n181\n00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.868\nIt cuts out, so you can see those\nvalues and it mask off the rest and\n\n182\n00:10:30.868 --> 00:10:32.787\nthat's actually what the average.\n\n183\n00:10:32.787 --> 00:10:36.147\nUpon like the initial dialogue\nbox I was like that's backwards.\n\n184\n00:10:36.147 --> 00:10:37.882\nThat's not how I would\nhave thought about that.\n\n185\n00:10:37.882 --> 00:10:39.924\nAverage numbers is the actual data.\n\n186\n00:10:39.924 --> 00:10:44.596\nCriteria is actually what you're trying\nto match the original range which is I\n\n187\n00:10:44.596 --> 00:10:49.010\nthink the range, the use of the word\nrange is what's confusing about it.\n\n188\n00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:53.807\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is, and that's where just\nunderstanding it, and it's that last one,\n\n189\n00:10:53.807 --> 00:10:56.672\ncuz if you didn't read\nthrough each one of them.\n\n190\n00:10:56.672 --> 00:11:01.434\nLike the actual cells that you're going\nto be performing the average on, okay,\n\n191\n00:11:01.434 --> 00:11:05.480\nit makes a little bit more sense if\nyou go through each one of them.\n\n192\n00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:10.060\nSo we can do the same thing if we wanted\nto do the average unit price of the food.\n\n193\n00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.380\nOkay, so just food, same idea.\n\n194\n00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:16.280\nSo I'm going to go to the answer at\nfunction, I'm gonna go to average if.\n\n195\n00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.600\nAll right, we click OK.\n\n196\n00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:22.737\nThe range, now notice this time I\nam choosing the heading I am going\n\n197\n00:11:22.737 --> 00:11:28.080\nA1 through A21, the criteria since\nI have it as a cell reference.\n\n198\n00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.977\nI'm going to click in,\nmake sure you click your cursor.\n\n199\n00:11:30.977 --> 00:11:34.228\nThat gets me through this day,\nI forget to move my cursor and\n\n200\n00:11:34.228 --> 00:11:38.470\nthen I am just populating, cuz it's\ngoing to populate whatever you select.\n\n201\n00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:40.610\nIt is gonna populate\nwherever your cursor is.\n\n202\n00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:43.110\nDon't forget to move in the next field.\n\n203\n00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:45.160\nThe criteria is food.\n\n204\n00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:53.310\nThe average range is D1 through D21.\n\n205\n00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:56.830\n95, and if look at my,\nand we said food, right?\n\n206\n00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:58.097\nSo here's food.\n\n207\n00:11:58.097 --> 00:12:01.016\nHere is, wait,\nI just did that wrong, didn't I?\n\n208\n00:12:01.016 --> 00:12:04.183\n[LAUGH] I just realized here.\n\n209\n00:12:04.183 --> 00:12:05.637\nLet's look at this.\n\n210\n00:12:05.637 --> 00:12:08.868\nAverage unit price, what I'm doing?\n\n211\n00:12:08.868 --> 00:12:13.152\nI'm doing the sales and\nthe unit price is over here\n\n212\n00:12:13.152 --> 00:12:16.222\n&gt;&gt; I was like, I got you.\n\n213\n00:12:16.222 --> 00:12:18.808\nYeah, yeah, you're right.\n\n214\n00:12:18.808 --> 00:12:23.340\nCuz I saw that last column for food and\nI was like those are all like 100 over,\n\n215\n00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.480\nhow is it getting an average of 99?\n\n216\n00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I wasn't doing the unit price.\n\n217\n00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.282\n&gt;&gt; But this actually illustrates something\nthat you've said all ready and I've said,\n\n218\n00:12:32.282 --> 00:12:36.651\nyou have to have kind of a gut feeling\nabout you shouldn't get like 5,000.\n\n219\n00:12:36.651 --> 00:12:38.680\nAnd you'll be like, whoa,\nthat's some expensive food.\n\n220\n00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.200\n&gt;&gt; Right [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n221\n00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.283\nknowing a little bit about your data,\nright?\n\n222\n00:12:42.283 --> 00:12:44.835\nThe respective trends or\nlike the boundaries or\n\n223\n00:12:44.835 --> 00:12:48.232\nwhatever will allow you to get,\nthat doesn't make any sense.\n\n224\n00:12:48.232 --> 00:12:51.148\nAnd keep you from propagating errors\nfurther on, so you can go and\n\n225\n00:12:51.148 --> 00:12:52.480\nfix them when they occur.\n\n226\n00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.200\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\nAnd\n\n227\n00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:57.740\nI love the color coding that you're\nPC world gives you, it's like, okay.\n\n228\n00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:03.100\nThat's the blues, and the reds, and\nthe purples I got knowing the formula,\n\n229\n00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.780\nand honestly if we look at that, if you\nwere looking at that by yourself like, no,\n\n230\n00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:08.710\nI don't know what that is, right?\n\n231\n00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:12.100\nThat's why to me, yes, it gives me\nthe options, but I don't like to type it,\n\n232\n00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.900\nI'm just gonna use the dialogue box.\n\n233\n00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:18.570\nBut in this sense, since I am somehow\nfamiliar with it, this is the criteria.\n\n234\n00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:23.000\nThis is the range of the criteria,\nthis is the criteria value.\n\n235\n00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.165\nThis is the one that I'm off on, so\nI'm just gonna edit it right here,\n\n236\n00:13:28.165 --> 00:13:32.209\nit's not D1 it's B1, and\nthen this needs to be B1.\n\n237\n00:13:32.209 --> 00:13:33.230\nOkay, there you go.\n\n238\n00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:34.700\nNow that's the unit price.\n\n239\n00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.810\nNow I have the correct column.\n\n240\n00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:39.900\nThen I hit Enter and I have 17.2.\n\n241\n00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:45.040\nYeah, that's better on the unit price,\ncuz if I look at my food,\n\n242\n00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:51.221\nthere we go, yep, 17.20, but\nthe sales, no, that's, there you go.\n\n243\n00:13:51.221 --> 00:13:56.360\nNone of your information is good\nto remember and everything.\n\n244\n00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:01.254\nNow again this one,\nI didn't put in the column.\n\n245\n00:14:01.254 --> 00:14:03.100\nI'm gonna hit the Escape key.\n\n246\n00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.060\nThis one, I did.\n\n247\n00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.520\nDid it do anything different?\n\n248\n00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.430\nNo, everything's fine.\n\n249\n00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:13.500\nThe placement we'll get you\na little wonky is if say,\n\n250\n00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:17.280\nI use the headers in my criteria range.\n\n251\n00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:22.090\nBut in my average range I want to be two,\nright?\n\n252\n00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:23.750\nDidn't grab it and I hit Enter.\n\n253\n00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:28.660\n19, that wasn't right, was it?\n\n254\n00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:32.630\nOkay, look at this.\n\n255\n00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:33.994\nIt's 17, 20.\n\n256\n00:14:33.994 --> 00:14:37.530\nSo that's a little strange,\nisn't it, right?\n\n257\n00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:44.965\nIt's still giving me a value, but\nit doesn't, it's not pulling that in.\n\n258\n00:14:44.965 --> 00:14:49.394\nThat's [LAUGH] you are deep in\nthought over there, Justin,\n\n259\n00:14:49.394 --> 00:14:51.528\nof how it actually did that.\n\n260\n00:14:51.528 --> 00:14:55.007\n&gt;&gt; Is it just averaging that column,\nlike is it a failsafe,\n\n261\n00:14:55.007 --> 00:14:59.434\nit's saying, you're not able to\nzip these two columns together.\n\n262\n00:14:59.434 --> 00:15:01.920\nI don't have a one to one match\nbetween these two columns.\n\n263\n00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.420\nDoes it just fall back and\nsay the average is this?\n\n264\n00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:08.130\n&gt;&gt; Well, the average of our unit price\nis actually down here is 14, 70.\n\n265\n00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:13.220\n&gt;&gt; All right, then I don't know,\nI don't know, that's kind of an odd one.\n\n266\n00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:16.780\n&gt;&gt; It is, okay, and\nI have tried to play around with this and\n\n267\n00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:19.830\nI don't know if it's like,\nremember when we were doing the average a.\n\n268\n00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:25.340\nAnd if it's text it doesn't see it,\nor it makes it zero?\n\n269\n00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:31.550\nI don't know if that's exactly the,\nexact, answer to this.\n\n270\n00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:33.225\nBasic, it's not right!\n\n271\n00:15:33.225 --> 00:15:36.430\n[LAUGHS] It is incorrect.\n\n272\n00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:40.295\nAnd it's like I don't, I can't match.\n\n273\n00:15:40.295 --> 00:15:43.135\nSo it's not going to give me the correct,\nremember the last one,\n\n274\n00:15:43.135 --> 00:15:45.605\nwhere it gave us an actual error.\n\n275\n00:15:45.605 --> 00:15:47.272\nThe divide zero.\n\n276\n00:15:47.272 --> 00:15:48.605\nNope, can't do this.\n\n277\n00:15:48.605 --> 00:15:50.435\nHere, it didn't give me an error.\n\n278\n00:15:50.435 --> 00:15:52.025\nBut that's not the right information.\n\n279\n00:15:52.025 --> 00:15:54.700\nThat's not the right\nanswer to my question.\n\n280\n00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.385\nSo you need to be careful.\n\n281\n00:15:57.385 --> 00:15:59.027\nBottom of the story.\nBottom of the story?\n\n282\n00:15:59.027 --> 00:16:01.941\nOkay.\n[LAUGH] The moral of the story is You need\n\n283\n00:16:01.941 --> 00:16:02.751\nto match.\n\n284\n00:16:02.751 --> 00:16:06.761\nIf you have headings, and you select\nyour headings, do it for all of them.\n\n285\n00:16:06.761 --> 00:16:08.639\nIf you don't use your headings for\nyour data,\n\n286\n00:16:08.639 --> 00:16:10.855\nthen don't use your headings\nanywhere else, okay.\n\n287\n00:16:10.855 --> 00:16:18.180\nThat's to me, in my experience, that's how\nI answer this question, match it, okay?\n\n288\n00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:21.051\nThat's all you got, so there you go.\n\n289\n00:16:21.051 --> 00:16:23.182\n[LAUGH] So that's our average if,\n\n290\n00:16:23.182 --> 00:16:28.240\nI know it's kind of an open-ended like,\nokay, we gotta just kinda move on.\n\n291\n00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.190\n&gt;&gt; That's sometimes what\nhappens though right?\n\n292\n00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:34.160\nYou get these and you're like, I don't\nreally know why this isn't working.\n\n293\n00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:38.539\nWell that's all right, you just need\nto know, messed up, that's not right,\n\n294\n00:16:38.539 --> 00:16:39.600\ngut instinct.\n\n295\n00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:44.810\nNow 19 and 17 are pretty close so that's\na gotcha that I would probably write down.\n\n296\n00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:48.000\nMaybe put on a post-it note, and go,\n[SOUND] tack that on my monitor.\n\n297\n00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.936\nAnd go, don't forget, you got uneven\nmatched columns and average if and\n\n298\n00:16:51.936 --> 00:16:53.750\nthings are gonna go awry.\n\n299\n00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:56.885\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nit's usually with the headings, okay, so\n\n300\n00:16:56.885 --> 00:16:58.460\njust be careful with that.\n\n301\n00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:02.101\nSo if we come over to our average ifs,\n\n302\n00:17:02.101 --> 00:17:07.191\nthis is where we have multiple criterias,\nright?\n\n303\n00:17:07.191 --> 00:17:11.160\nSo average quantity of toys $20 and\nover, so\n\n304\n00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:15.240\naverage quantity, so\nit's this column right?\n\n305\n00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:19.380\nOkay this is where you gotta make sure\nI'm doing the right columns there Justin.\n\n306\n00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:26.230\nOkay average quantity of toys, so\nthis is the column that has my criteria.\n\n307\n00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:32.629\nAnd then the value is toys right, but\nthe other criteria is that it is $20,\n\n308\n00:17:32.629 --> 00:17:37.864\nI would say unit price,\nsorry I should probably clarify that.\n\n309\n00:17:37.864 --> 00:17:45.030\nQuantities of toys with unit price,\nthere we go, $20 and over.\n\n310\n00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:48.184\nSo, that means if I, let's actually\njust look at a very small dataset, okay,\n\n311\n00:17:48.184 --> 00:17:49.280\nhere are our toys, right.\n\n312\n00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:54.350\nHow many of them are $20 dollars and over?\n\n313\n00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.900\n&gt;&gt; The last three, they're 20, 22 and 23,\n\n314\n00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:01.460\nso then that would just\nbe those last three.\n\n315\n00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.980\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so the answer is 3.333, right?\n\n316\n00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:10.160\nSo, on a small set that's great,\nlarge set, much more difficult.\n\n317\n00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.741\nSo, that's where we need to, and\n\n318\n00:18:11.741 --> 00:18:15.447\nI'm hearing that greater than just to kind\nof show you like that operator I think I\n\n319\n00:18:15.447 --> 00:18:17.750\neven alluded to that in\none of the other episodes.\n\n320\n00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:21.156\nIt doesn't have to be just like\na set value or a hard coded thing,\n\n321\n00:18:21.156 --> 00:18:23.568\nyou can go ahead and\ndo expressions that way.\n\n322\n00:18:23.568 --> 00:18:28.980\nSo expressions means it has to evaluate,\nis it than or equal to 20?\n\n323\n00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:31.395\nLet's do it, ready?\n\n324\n00:18:31.395 --> 00:18:32.369\nCursor where you want it,\n\n325\n00:18:32.369 --> 00:18:35.080\nyou're definitely gonna wanna use\nthe insert function dialogue box.\n\n326\n00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:38.724\nSo, Insert Function, average,\nifs, l already got it up,\n\n327\n00:18:38.724 --> 00:18:40.800\nwe know that we move for it, okay.\n\n328\n00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:46.910\nClick okay, okay [LAUGH] I swear,\nyou need to read.\n\n329\n00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:49.850\nAverage, the actual cells\nto find the average weight.\n\n330\n00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:52.617\nBut the other one, that was the end right?\n\n331\n00:18:52.617 --> 00:18:57.410\nOkay, [LAUGH] now with the ifs,\nit goes in the front, okay?\n\n332\n00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:00.363\nSo the actual cells that we need to use,\n\n333\n00:19:00.363 --> 00:19:04.980\nand then the criteria range,\nand then the criteria.\n\n334\n00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:10.930\nIf I keep going, do you see how each time\nI click into the field, it keeps going.\n\n335\n00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:14.370\nOkay, so\nnow I have these two criterias, so\n\n336\n00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:18.180\nlet's go ahead and say what am I,\noops sorry, that's the wrong key.\n\n337\n00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:22.870\nI am averaging up what cells,\noops, cancel.\n\n338\n00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:24.720\n[SOUND] Sorry, let's just start over.\n\n339\n00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.800\n[LAUGH] Escape will take\nyou all the way out of it.\n\n340\n00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:32.920\nLet's go with average ifs, we click OK,\nmy cursor's in the right place.\n\n341\n00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:35.492\nD2, hold the shift key, D21,\n\n342\n00:19:35.492 --> 00:19:40.650\nthat's my range that I'm going to\nactually perform the average on.\n\n343\n00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:45.795\nThe criteria range one is my categories,\n\n344\n00:19:45.795 --> 00:19:51.680\nit needs to be in\nthe category A2 through 21.\n\n345\n00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:57.476\nThe criteria is, now I don't have a cell\nref, I could like reference in itself but\n\n346\n00:19:57.476 --> 00:20:01.145\nwe're going to just to type in the word,\ntoys.\n\n347\n00:20:01.145 --> 00:20:06.400\nLet's type it in correctly, notice how\nit automatically when I hit the tab\n\n348\n00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:11.250\nkey to move on, it goes ahead and puts it\nin parenthesis cuz it's a string of text.\n\n349\n00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:14.460\nAnd it's already averaging 81 right now.\n\n350\n00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:21.310\nI just realized,\nIt's not the quantity is it, it's c.\n\n351\n00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:23.460\nJustin you were supposed to.\n\n352\n00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:25.270\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry there's a lot going on over\n\n353\n00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:25.930\nhere, Vonne.\n\n354\n00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:28.820\nI would've caught it afterwards I promise,\n\n355\n00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.546\nI would've been like wait\na minute that's not right.\n\n356\n00:20:30.546 --> 00:20:34.659\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I figured I'd catch it right\nnow, because I still wanna go ahead and\n\n357\n00:20:34.659 --> 00:20:35.930\ntotal up the numbers.\n\n358\n00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:41.350\nBut did you notice down here I started\nto look and said wait that's not right.\n\n359\n00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:44.410\nI'm doing the totals again,\nI'm not doing the unit prices.\n\n360\n00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:46.480\n&gt;&gt; And you should do those things.\n\n361\n00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:50.556\nActually you said something that it\nputs it in parentheses if it's text, or\n\n362\n00:20:50.556 --> 00:20:51.793\nit should be quotes?\n\n363\n00:20:51.793 --> 00:20:53.130\nDid I use the wrong teminology there?\n\n364\n00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:54.459\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, I was just making sure that\n\n365\n00:20:54.459 --> 00:20:56.750\nit's actually like doing what\nit's supposed to be doing.\n\n366\n00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:57.490\n&gt;&gt; It's quotes.\n\n367\n00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:00.772\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I just called them parentheses.\n\n368\n00:21:00.772 --> 00:21:02.317\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Tomato, tomato, question mark,\n\n369\n00:21:02.317 --> 00:21:03.231\ngeez how about that?\n\n370\n00:21:03.231 --> 00:21:07.745\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Which would give us very,\nvery different answers, so yes.\n\n371\n00:21:07.745 --> 00:21:13.170\nParentheses for the text that I'm hard\ncoding into this particular criteria.\n\n372\n00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:16.110\nNow, the next criteria range we said,\nit has to be a toy but,\n\n373\n00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:20.260\nit has to be greater\nthan $20 of a unit price.\n\n374\n00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:24.330\nSo, what's going to be the range for\nmy second criteria?\n\n375\n00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:27.700\nB2 through,\n\n376\n00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:33.210\nhold the shift key, B21, okay cuz I'm\nnot using headings in this example.\n\n377\n00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:39.620\nThe criteria here would need to\nbe greater than or equal to 20.\n\n378\n00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:43.349\nNow you don't have to put\nin like the dollar sign and\n\n379\n00:21:43.349 --> 00:21:46.310\nthe dot decimals because it is a number.\n\n380\n00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:50.460\nIt's just looking like currency\nbecause of the number formatting.\n\n381\n00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:53.090\nOkay, and that's what I need to have.\n\n382\n00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:57.112\nAnd so it looks like,\nI think we are good here,\n\n383\n00:21:57.112 --> 00:22:02.150\nlet's click okay, and\nwe got it, yay, all right.\n\n384\n00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:06.500\nAnd that is a very complex\nlooking formula, lots of commas,\n\n385\n00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:10.950\nand quotes, and there's a greater than,\nand these ranges.\n\n386\n00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:16.420\nThat's why using the dialog box is gonna\nmake it a lot easier for yourself.\n\n387\n00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:21.820\nSo that is the average quantity of\ntoys with a unit price over $20.\n\n388\n00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:27.110\nSo that is a lot of ifs going on there so.\n\n389\n00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:29.700\n[SOUND] I have another example.\n\n390\n00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.645\nOkay, and we're getting low on time but\nthis is one,\n\n391\n00:22:32.645 --> 00:22:35.600\nlet's just take this and\nexpand it a little bit more.\n\n392\n00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:40.210\nOkay, I have shirt sizes,\nI have colors and I have numbers sold.\n\n393\n00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:44.970\nSo I have three colors of shirts pink,\nblue, or yellow.\n\n394\n00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:50.110\nI have three sizes, small, medium and\nlarge, and they're just kind of random.\n\n395\n00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:52.890\nSo, I have some smalls and\nsome larges and some mediums.\n\n396\n00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:59.830\nI would like to average small pink, small\nyellow, small blue, get the idea right?\n\n397\n00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:02.959\nI want all of these different categories.\n\n398\n00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.310\nAm I going to type this in\nall these take notes, yeah,\n\n399\n00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:08.020\nI'm not going to do this over and\nover and over again.\n\n400\n00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:14.064\nHow many times is this,\nthat is wait, nine, right?\n\n401\n00:23:14.064 --> 00:23:18.930\nMath [LAUGH],\nyes this is how we're gonna do it.\n\n402\n00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:24.099\nSame way, but we're gonna throw in\nsome mix of absolute references and\n\n403\n00:23:24.099 --> 00:23:26.280\nrelative references.\n\n404\n00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:30.698\nSo let's go with our insert function,\naverage ifs,\n\n405\n00:23:30.698 --> 00:23:35.180\nclick okay, average range we\nare averaging up the number sold.\n\n406\n00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:38.360\nSo we went to select all of these, okay?\n\n407\n00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.120\nThe average range okay, criteria one,\n\n408\n00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.220\nsee I even have to like\nokay what's my next step?\n\n409\n00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:47.080\nCriteria range one is the size,\n\n410\n00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:53.460\nI would like to take the sizes,\nthe criteria is going to be,\n\n411\n00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:57.540\nright here I'm using the cell reference,\nso that's the first criteria.\n\n412\n00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:03.286\nThe second criteria is the color,\nso B2 Through B35.\n\n413\n00:24:03.286 --> 00:24:09.240\nThe criteria value is the color.\n\n414\n00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:11.190\nSo that is what I have.\n\n415\n00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:13.580\nMake sense?\n\n416\n00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:16.798\nClick OK, that works.\n\n417\n00:24:16.798 --> 00:24:22.240\nWe get excited and\nwe copy this down, that looks right.\n\n418\n00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:24.190\nIt's not, is it?\n\n419\n00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:27.432\nIt is not right at all.\n\n420\n00:24:27.432 --> 00:24:32.627\nThe reason is because, and if you haven't\nseen the absolute reference and relative\n\n421\n00:24:32.627 --> 00:24:38.280\nreference episode, I believe it's Function\nBasics Part 2, definitely check that out.\n\n422\n00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:43.988\nAny time that we're copying down we're\nmoving all of the references down.\n\n423\n00:24:43.988 --> 00:24:50.120\nSo if I look here, C2 through C35,\nthis just changed from C3 to C36.\n\n424\n00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:54.230\nWhat's down here in C36?\n\n425\n00:24:56.250 --> 00:25:02.710\nNothing, okay, talking about knowing\nyour numbers and no, that's not right.\n\n426\n00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:05.280\nI need to change that.\n\n427\n00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:10.410\nSo what you have to do is I would like\nthe references here, the criteria.\n\n428\n00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:17.990\nCuz remember, if we double-click on this,\nthis is the value of the criteria.\n\n429\n00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:21.077\nThat one I wanna move down,\nwhen I copy this function, to say,\n\n430\n00:25:21.077 --> 00:25:23.365\nchange this to medium,\nchange this to large.\n\n431\n00:25:23.365 --> 00:25:29.016\nChange this to pink and change this\nto yellow, change this to blue.\n\n432\n00:25:29.016 --> 00:25:33.510\nDon't ever change the range of\ninformation that you're looking at.\n\n433\n00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:37.350\nYou are always going to\nlook at C2 through C35.\n\n434\n00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:41.010\nYou are always going to\nlook at B2 through B35.\n\n435\n00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:45.820\nYou're always going to look\nat these numbers to average.\n\n436\n00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.340\nSo you need absolute references.\n\n437\n00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:52.628\nI do not have a full size keyboard right\nnow, so I cannot throw the F4 key to go\n\n438\n00:25:52.628 --> 00:25:56.650\nahead and automatically change\nthis to an absolute reference.\n\n439\n00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:59.169\nDollar sign in front of the C and\nthe, oops that's the wrong one.\n\n440\n00:25:59.169 --> 00:26:04.180\nAnd the two, don't ever change there,\nsame thing here.\n\n441\n00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:06.590\nThere, okay?\n\n442\n00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:09.206\nHere is another range,\nthis is the criteria range.\n\n443\n00:26:09.206 --> 00:26:14.215\nSo dollar signs here,\noops dollar signs there.\n\n444\n00:26:14.215 --> 00:26:18.190\nNo dollar signs here, that stays relative.\n\n445\n00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:21.988\nThis needs to be absoluted\nas well to fix its position.\n\n446\n00:26:21.988 --> 00:26:26.480\nThis stays relative, yeah.\n\n447\n00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:30.303\nNow on this very first one,\nwhen I hit Enter, nothing should change.\n\n448\n00:26:30.303 --> 00:26:34.800\nCuz that is the exact same\ncalculation that it is performing.\n\n449\n00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.685\nBut if I take this and I pull it down, and\n\n450\n00:26:37.685 --> 00:26:41.458\njust keep an eye on these\nnumbers if I change these.\n\n451\n00:26:41.458 --> 00:26:44.540\nThose did change down there.\n\n452\n00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:48.653\nBecause it makes a difference, and\nthat is always looking at the same range.\n\n453\n00:26:48.653 --> 00:26:52.686\nSo that is scary looking, very scary.\n\n454\n00:26:52.686 --> 00:26:56.900\nBut when you break it down,\nyou go to the insert function dialog box.\n\n455\n00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:01.765\nAnd you understand when you need relative\nreference and when you need absolute\n\n456\n00:27:01.765 --> 00:27:06.628\nreferences you can make something that\nis somewhat simple and average at these\n\n457\n00:27:06.628 --> 00:27:11.360\nnumbers based on this criteria and\nreally complicate it with that formula.\n\n458\n00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:14.240\nBut it all kind of comes together.\n\n459\n00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.490\nSo hopefully that makes\nsome sense to you guys.\n\n460\n00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:19.150\nAnd you can use those examples for\nthings that you need.\n\n461\n00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:22.669\nBecause these are common things\nthat you need in a business or\n\n462\n00:27:22.669 --> 00:27:26.130\nin an organization that,\nI need this type of calculation.\n\n463\n00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:30.829\nBut if it's a, b and c or x, y and z,\nit has to meet those criterias for\n\n464\n00:27:30.829 --> 00:27:33.270\nyou to be able to add those numbers.\n\n465\n00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:34.048\nSo there you go.\n\n466\n00:27:34.048 --> 00:27:35.273\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne, thank you so\n\n467\n00:27:35.273 --> 00:27:38.630\nmuch, I can see this average if is\nalmost like a progressive filter.\n\n468\n00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:40.391\nOkay put this up, put this up and\n\n469\n00:27:40.391 --> 00:27:44.501\nnow I can only see a small subset of my\ndata that are based on these respective\n\n470\n00:27:44.501 --> 00:27:48.500\ncriteria and their criterion ranges,\nand then find the average there.\n\n471\n00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.346\nNow before we get out of here, Vonne,\n\n472\n00:27:50.346 --> 00:27:53.130\nare there any kinda final\nparting words of wisdom for us?\n\n473\n00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:56.712\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's funny because as soon as\nyou starting going, like, wait, hold on,\n\n474\n00:27:56.712 --> 00:27:58.310\nI forgot something really quickly.\n\n475\n00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:02.890\nI'm doing this through functions\nbecause I can't change the information.\n\n476\n00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:05.753\nJust quickly down here, there's a couple\nworksheets that I skipped over.\n\n477\n00:28:05.753 --> 00:28:07.388\nThey're like,\nwhy do you have that in there?\n\n478\n00:28:07.388 --> 00:28:09.991\nSo let's come back into here.\n\n479\n00:28:09.991 --> 00:28:12.645\nI love tables.\n\n480\n00:28:12.645 --> 00:28:18.136\nAnd I could format my information as\na table, and then come down to here.\n\n481\n00:28:18.136 --> 00:28:22.720\nThis is my subtotal and\nit's doing the average.\n\n482\n00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.978\nSo if you haven't seen the episodes\non tables definitely check out\n\n483\n00:28:25.978 --> 00:28:28.142\nthe Excel Advanced Series, I love tables.\n\n484\n00:28:28.142 --> 00:28:30.869\nCuz I'm adding a subtotal line and\ndoing my average.\n\n485\n00:28:30.869 --> 00:28:31.850\nThat's for everything.\n\n486\n00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:36.820\nSo I could come up to here and\nsay, well only give me the smalls.\n\n487\n00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:40.451\nWell the average for\nall the smalls is 3.5.\n\n488\n00:28:40.451 --> 00:28:45.240\nGo ahead and give me the average for\njust the small blue.\n\n489\n00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.871\nIt's 3.\nI could totally do this,\n\n490\n00:28:46.871 --> 00:28:51.400\nthere's nothing wrong with this,\nit's dynamically changing.\n\n491\n00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:54.090\nYou could take this and copy and\npaste it out and everything like that.\n\n492\n00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:58.390\nBut here, there's a reason why there's\nsometimes you wanna do tables, and\n\n493\n00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:00.762\nwhy sometimes you wanna do functions.\n\n494\n00:29:00.762 --> 00:29:03.900\nIn the old way of performing functions,\n\n495\n00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:08.710\nbecause of how you need to bring\nup the data or report the data.\n\n496\n00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:11.730\nSometimes well,,\nyou get really good at tables.\n\n497\n00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:15.165\nYou're like, this is so\nmuch easier, this is almost easier.\n\n498\n00:29:15.165 --> 00:29:18.833\nBecause it's just, once your absolute\nreferences are [SOUND] pull it down,\n\n499\n00:29:18.833 --> 00:29:20.752\ntake that part out, put it somewhere.\n\n500\n00:29:20.752 --> 00:29:22.778\nEmail it off to somebody and you're fine.\n\n501\n00:29:22.778 --> 00:29:24.942\nAnd so I didn't want you to think,\n\n502\n00:29:24.942 --> 00:29:28.790\nwhy did you skip over those\nworksheets that say tables?\n\n503\n00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:33.608\nCuz you are, in a sense, doing the same\nthing without having to think about all\n\n504\n00:29:33.608 --> 00:29:38.004\nthat crazy syntax, and look at\nthe inserts and function dialogue box.\n\n505\n00:29:38.004 --> 00:29:40.796\nBut it's just, it's a different\nfunctionality and when and\n\n506\n00:29:40.796 --> 00:29:42.500\nwhere you want to use it.\n\n507\n00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:45.969\n&gt;&gt; Right, we could get those same answers\nexcept there are some nuanced differences.\n\n508\n00:29:45.969 --> 00:29:48.100\nI only get one of those totals at a time.\n\n509\n00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:52.894\nWhereas I want a more macroscopic view of\ncomparing these respective combinations of\n\n510\n00:29:52.894 --> 00:29:53.700\ncategories.\n\n511\n00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:57.886\nSo they're different contexts,\nthey achieve the same results.\n\n512\n00:29:57.886 --> 00:29:58.721\nMe personally,\n\n513\n00:29:58.721 --> 00:30:01.950\nI like to have all of the data in\nfront of me at once if I can help it.\n\n514\n00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:04.260\nSo thank you so much, Vonne,\nand thank you for joining us.\n\n515\n00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:05.980\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n516\n00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:08.619\nSo signing off for

I'm doing pretty good.\n\n13\n00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.159\nThat was really a nice punny\n\n14\n00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:39.089\nintroduction there.\n\n15\n00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:39.971\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n16\n00:00:39.971 --> 00:00:41.291\n&gt;&gt; I do try sometimes,\n\n17\n00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:43.040\nVonne, I do try.\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n18\n00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.820\nwell, you mentioned they seem\nkind of the same, min, max.\n\n19\n00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.846\nI mean, what do you think\nof when you think of min?\n\n20\n00:00:50.846 --> 00:00:52.682\n&gt;&gt; The smallest in a collection?\n\n21\n00:00:52.682 --> 00:00:53.931\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when you think of small?\n\n22\n00:00:53.931 --> 00:00:58.072\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The smallest thing that I could have?\n\n23\n00:00:58.072 --> 00:01:00.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly.\n\n24\n00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.067\nI'm trying to illustrate the point that\nit sounds like they are going to be\n\n25\n00:01:05.067 --> 00:01:08.176\nsimilar functions, and\nthey are to a degree.\n\n26\n00:01:08.176 --> 00:01:11.460\nBut I'm going to show\nyou they are different.\n\n27\n00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.360\nAnd min and max, minimum value,\nmaximum value within a certain range,\n\n28\n00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.270\nand if I look at a certain\nnumber is what's the highest?\n\n29\n00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.270\nWhat's the lowest, okay?\n\n30\n00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.873\nAnd that's what it's going to do,\nit's gonna pull that right back out.\n\n31\n00:01:21.873 --> 00:01:26.205\nThese are I'd probably say one\nof the more basic functions.\n\n32\n00:01:26.205 --> 00:01:30.345\nThey are in the autosum button, or\nthe little button that we saw that\n\n33\n00:01:30.345 --> 00:01:33.205\nwe could do the average, we could\ndo the sum, we could do the count.\n\n34\n00:01:33.205 --> 00:01:35.925\nThere's also min and\nmax that's in that list as well.\n\n35\n00:01:35.925 --> 00:01:43.240\nSo I would say it's one of the big ones\nthat does a very simple function, okay?\n\n36\n00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.810\nAnd then the small and large,\n\n37\n00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.160\nthere's just a little bit of\ndifferentiation going on there.\n\n38\n00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.640\nSo why don't we just go ahead and\n\n39\n00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.680\nget started and\nI'm gonna call on you there, Justin.\n\n40\n00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.890\nSo get ready.\n\n41\n00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.128\nPut on your thinking caps,\nthis one's gonna be tough.\n\n42\n00:01:58.128 --> 00:01:59.782\n&gt;&gt; I will try my best, Vonne, and\n\n43\n00:01:59.782 --> 00:02:01.890\nI don't know if I have my thinking cap.\n\n44\n00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.490\nI'm still working on its construction.\n\n45\n00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.310\nIt actually started as a base trucker hat\nand then now I'm putting other things on.\n\n46\n00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.160\nNah, I joke,\n\n47\n00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.590\nI'll try my best to be ready, though.\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna bedazzle it up\n\n48\n00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.368\na little bit?\n&gt;&gt; I don't know what that means,\n\n49\n00:02:14.368 --> 00:02:15.599\nbut [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n50\n00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.700\nwell, how about I go with numbers?\n\n51\n00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.500\nYou know numbers so.\n&gt;&gt; I do know numbers.\n\n52\n00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.595\n&gt;&gt; All right, so why don't we go ahead and\n\n53\n00:02:21.595 --> 00:02:24.653\njump down to our files called min,\nmax, small, large.\n\n54\n00:02:24.653 --> 00:02:26.110\nFancy that.\n\n55\n00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.550\nSo if I'm looking at this\nlittle group of numbers, right?\n\n56\n00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.530\nWe have our cats and\nhow many times they meowed.\n\n57\n00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.500\nAnd of course Bishop,\nhe has just gone crazy lately.\n\n58\n00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.073\nHe will not be quiet.\n\n59\n00:02:38.073 --> 00:02:41.349\n[LAUGH] All right, so if I looked at this,\nlooking at these numbers,\n\n60\n00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.353\ncan you see them by the way, Justin?\n&gt;&gt; I can see them.\n\n61\n00:02:43.353 --> 00:02:45.498\nI can see them very clearly.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n62\n00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:48.520\ncuz I know our TVs are kinda far away,\nso I was just making sure.\n\n63\n00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.770\nIf I was looking at this list of numbers,\nwhat is the maximum value?\n\n64\n00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.660\nWhat's the highest value in there?\n&gt;&gt; The highest value is 50.\n\n65\n00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.475\n&gt;&gt; Okay, what's the lowest value?\n\n66\n00:02:58.475 --> 00:03:00.287\n&gt;&gt; That would be 1.\n\n67\n00:03:00.287 --> 00:03:01.440\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm,\n\n68\n00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.348\nwhat would be the second largest value?\n\n69\n00:03:06.348 --> 00:03:09.028\nSecond largest value is 25.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, right and\n\n70\n00:03:09.028 --> 00:03:14.283\nthen the second smallest value.\n&gt;&gt; I think that it's 4.\n\n71\n00:03:14.283 --> 00:03:15.699\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yes.\n\n72\n00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:19.110\nSo those are things that we would look and\nwe evaluate within this range.\n\n73\n00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.960\nAnd we looked at them and\nsaid what's the highest,\n\n74\n00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.210\nwhat's the lowest, what's the second\nhighest, what's the second lowest.\n\n75\n00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.610\nThat's exactly what these functions do,\nmin lowest, max highest.\n\n76\n00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.360\nThe small you get to determine\nthe placement, okay?\n\n77\n00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.860\nLike may what is this six smallest value?\n\n78\n00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.536\nWhat is this second smallest value?\n\n79\n00:03:42.536 --> 00:03:44.648\nAnd that's what is going to do evaluate.\n\n80\n00:03:44.648 --> 00:03:48.190\nIt's only going to bring back the value.\n\n81\n00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.935\nIt's looking at this range.\n\n82\n00:03:48.935 --> 00:03:55.395\nSo it's not saying, okay,\nso who had the most meows?\n\n83\n00:03:55.395 --> 00:03:58.610\nI would say Bishop, but that's different.\n\n84\n00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.110\nThat's me going to this number and\n\n85\n00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.120\nthen looking over into another\narea to pull out the cat's name.\n\n86\n00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.715\nThat's not what this function does.\n\n87\n00:04:07.715 --> 00:04:10.510\nIf you're thinking like,\nbut I want it to do that.\n\n88\n00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.200\nThat's somewhere else, that's kind of\nmixing multiple functions together.\n\n89\n00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.630\nWe're just trying to say with these\nepisodes in like the function library,\n\n90\n00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.340\nthis is just what the function does,\nthat's it.\n\n91\n00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.060\nBuilding blocks, then we can go ahead and\nput them all together in other examples.\n\n92\n00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.610\n&gt;&gt; So small and\n\n93\n00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.980\nlarge are kind of like abstractions\nover min and max where min and\n\n94\n00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.840\nmax are like I want the absolute\nlargest or the absolute smallest.\n\n95\n00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.200\nSmall and large are like,\nI want the second smallest,\n\n96\n00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.490\nI want the third smallest.\n\n97\n00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.140\nIt allows a little more I guess\nfluidity in your selection, right?\n\n98\n00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.951\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like placement.\n\n99\n00:04:43.951 --> 00:04:50.560\nIf I had a list of 20,000 numbers,\ngive me the top 10 or whatever.\n\n100\n00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.030\nSo give me the largest then the second\nlargest then the third largest and\n\n101\n00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.850\nthe fourth largest.\n\n102\n00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.270\nNow, each one of those is\nits own function, okay?\n\n103\n00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.614\nSo, you would have to go ahead and\nchange it.\n\n104\n00:05:00.614 --> 00:05:04.220\nSo, all this talking, why don't we do it?\n\n105\n00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.930\nOkay, so let's go ahead and\nfind the minimum value.\n\n106\n00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.770\nSo I select my cursor, I select the cell\nthat I want the answer to go into.\n\n107\n00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.340\nThat's always step one.\n\n108\n00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.090\nIn this one we're going to go to\nthe autosum button on the home tab,\n\n109\n00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.180\nwe could have also gone to it on\nthe data tab, that's not the data tab,\n\n110\n00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.695\nhow about the formula tab.\n\n111\n00:05:21.695 --> 00:05:25.040\n[LAUGH] And then go to autosum,\nand there is your min.\n\n112\n00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.419\nSo it's saying here's my function name.\n\n113\n00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:30.477\nIt automatically tries to pull in the cell\nreferences that it thinks it needs,\n\n114\n00:05:30.477 --> 00:05:32.943\nthat's not what I want,\nwhite plus sign only.\n\n115\n00:05:32.943 --> 00:05:36.046\nSelect the range of cells\nthat it needs to evaluate.\n\n116\n00:05:36.046 --> 00:05:39.990\nWhich is B2:B11, so that's through.\n\n117\n00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:46.800\nYou hit Enter to accept it and just\nlike you said, one is the minimum value.\n\n118\n00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.980\nSame thing with the max.\n\n119\n00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.366\nNow, look, let's do just\na slight variation just for fun.\n\n120\n00:05:50.366 --> 00:05:53.298\nLet's type it out,\ncuz this one's not to terribly hard.\n\n121\n00:05:53.298 --> 00:05:54.998\nSo we will start off with an equals.\n\n122\n00:05:54.998 --> 00:05:59.150\nWe will type in the function name,\nwhich is max.\n\n123\n00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.670\nOpen up the parentheses.\n\n124\n00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.140\nUsing our cursor or using our\nmouse we can come and select it or\n\n125\n00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.970\nyou could type it in.\n\n126\n00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.740\nBut I think it's easier to\njust go ahead and select it.\n\n127\n00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.986\nI always like to go ahead and\nclose the parentheses.\n\n128\n00:06:11.986 --> 00:06:12.677\nI am using that right.\n\n129\n00:06:12.677 --> 00:06:13.810\nI just said parentheses.\n\n130\n00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:14.877\nI didn't say quotes in the last one,\ndid I?\n\n131\n00:06:14.877 --> 00:06:15.699\n&gt;&gt;

The more you know, right?\n\n261\n00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:37.850\n&gt;&gt; Well, make it to where you're like,\n\n262\n00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:39.830\nI don't understand what's going on.\n\n263\n00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:42.680\nBut now you know what the min and\nmax and what true and false means.\n\n264\n00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:46.240\nLet's come back over here to the smalls,\nbecause I just wanted to show.\n\n265\n00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.360\nI think you get the idea\nof how this works.\n\n266\n00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.240\nBut let's go with the, hey,\nI want to go ahead and copy down.\n\n267\n00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.510\nWe've down a couple of the episodes\nwhere do the absolute reference and\n\n268\n00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:57.300\nthen everything else changes.\n\n269\n00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.920\nLet's type in, we'll go crazy,\nwe're gonna type it.\n\n270\n00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:05.180\nWe're gonna say small, and\nthen we're going to open up the bracket.\n\n271\n00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.902\nWe're going to type in B2,\nbecause I know that's my array, :B11.\n\n272\n00:14:08.902 --> 00:14:13.390\nI can see it highlighting, that's good.\n\n273\n00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:16.023\nI'm not done though,\nI know, I'm sorry I forgot.\n\n274\n00:14:16.023 --> 00:14:18.106\n[LAUGH] And then comma.\n\n275\n00:14:18.106 --> 00:14:22.540\nLet's go with 2, because I know\nthat that is the placement I want.\n\n276\n00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:25.070\nAnd because we're getting fancy I'm like,\nI just want to go ahead and\n\n277\n00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:26.580\ncopy this down, right?\n\n278\n00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:30.260\nSo we absolute reference\nthe first cell and\n\n279\n00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:34.040\nthen we absolute reference\nthe second cell.\n\n280\n00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.690\nYou hit Enter and that's correct.\n\n281\n00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:39.060\nSo you're getting all excited and\nlike, yeah, let's go ahead and go.\n\n282\n00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.960\nWell, that didn't work, right?\n\n283\n00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:47.330\nDo you know why there, Justin?\n&gt;&gt; I'm guessing it's not auto-incrementing\n\n284\n00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:51.130\nthe respective second value,\nbecause it's not reading from something.\n\n285\n00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:53.460\nIt's not considered a range or\na sequence or anything like that.\n\n286\n00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:54.610\n&gt;&gt; Or a cell reference.\n\n287\n00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:55.750\nYes, so, yeah.\n\n288\n00:14:55.750 --> 00:15:00.180\nIt doesn't do the same kinda copying\nthat you might think it would because of\n\n289\n00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:01.830\nwhat we just said.\n\n290\n00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:04.460\nSo that's just something to realize then\n\n291\n00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:08.400\nthat the nice thing is if you do\nkeep it at a absolute reference.\n\n292\n00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.470\nAll you have to do is come into\neach one of your formulas and\n\n293\n00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:18.870\nthen change that particular placement\nin the array that you would want.\n\n294\n00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:21.838\nSo doesn't work like you might\nthink some of our other, like,\n\n295\n00:15:21.838 --> 00:15:23.408\nlet's just go ahead and copy it.\n\n296\n00:15:23.408 --> 00:15:27.675\nSo I can automatically populate it\nwith the relative reference and\n\n297\n00:15:27.675 --> 00:15:29.610\nthe absolute reference.\n\n298\n00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:30.920\nIt doesn't exactly work.\n\n299\n00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:35.202\nSo I just wanted to go ahead and\nthrow that in there.\n\n300\n00:15:35.202 --> 00:15:37.225\nOne last, do you have any other question?\n\n301\n00:15:37.225 --> 00:15:39.219\nSorry, you had a puzzling\nlook on your face.\n\n302\n00:15:39.219 --> 00:15:40.961\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, my mind went, well,\n\n303\n00:15:40.961 --> 00:15:45.670\nthat second, third, fourth, I could\njust take the first number of that.\n\n304\n00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:47.380\nI was thinking about getting\ncrazy with functions.\n\n305\n00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.080\nLike splitting this text up and\nusing that as a number,\n\n306\n00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.490\nand putting that as the second.\n\n307\n00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:55.780\nAnd that way I can have human\nreadable text and then, and\n\n308\n00:15:55.780 --> 00:16:00.426\nit's just an exercise of the main.\n&gt;&gt; I went there too, I'm like,\n\n309\n00:16:00.426 --> 00:16:03.140\nhow can you make that like\nautomatically updated.\n\n310\n00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:04.730\nI mean, you could figure it out,\n\n311\n00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:07.580\nlike making some types of nested\nstatements until you're like,\n\n312\n00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:12.273\nthis is this and this is that like\nfind the min, but make this change.\n\n313\n00:16:12.273 --> 00:16:14.160\nSo, I'm not saying it's not possible.\n\n314\n00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:14.850\nIt is.\n\n315\n00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:16.506\nI just like you said,\n\n316\n00:16:16.506 --> 00:16:20.484\nit's just too much now.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And just for fun just to show\n\n317\n00:16:20.484 --> 00:16:25.466\nyou that in this particular large range\nof cells, it doesn't have to go across.\n\n318\n00:16:25.466 --> 00:16:29.466\nIt can be both, if I want to\ndefine the minimum value here,\n\n319\n00:16:29.466 --> 00:16:34.270\nI could just say, let's go ahead and\ngo across all this.\n\n320\n00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:40.300\nIt doesn't have to be in one column and\nin one row, or across or down.\n\n321\n00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:41.650\nIt can go both.\n\n322\n00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:46.070\nAnd the same way with your max, just for\nfun, we'll go ahead and take this.\n\n323\n00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:50.380\nCould have just copied it and\nchange out the max.\n\n324\n00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:51.620\nSo that's just telling me where it is.\n\n325\n00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:55.250\nBut when you have a large range of\nnumbers like this, it's like, okay,\n\n326\n00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:56.340\nI know it's negative 5.\n\n327\n00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:57.910\nWhere is negative 5?\n\n328\n00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:04.390\nIn this example, I'm just going back\nto you can do conditional formatting.\n\n329\n00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:06.430\nBecause conditional\nformatting's more of a visual.\n\n330\n00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:08.530\nThis gives me the result.\n\n331\n00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:12.973\nBut if I wanted to look at these numbers\nand tell me what the lowest value is.\n\n332\n00:17:12.973 --> 00:17:15.602\nIf you go back and select it first, okay,\n\n333\n00:17:15.602 --> 00:17:21.000\nwe do have an episode on conditional\nformatting in the advanced Excel series.\n\n334\n00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.010\nBut if I go to the Top and Bottom Rules,\nand then go to More Rules,\n\n335\n00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:30.560\nI want to have the top, not the top ten,\nI want the top one, okay?\n\n336\n00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:36.470\nAnd then, format with it,\nlet's just put in a fill of red, okay?\n\n337\n00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:37.170\nWait, no, that's the top.\n\n338\n00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:38.268\nMaybe we'll do green?\n\n339\n00:17:38.268 --> 00:17:40.700\nWe'll make it red, how about that, okay?\n\n340\n00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.560\nAnd, there it is, okay?\n\n341\n00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:47.290\nAnd I can do the same thing here as if I\nwanted to go ahead and go back and say,\n\n342\n00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:50.970\nwell, now go ahead and\ngive me the bottom one, and\n\n343\n00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:54.770\nthen we'll format this with yellow.\n\n344\n00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:59.400\nUsing colors that don't match what\nwe're trying to show, but you see,\n\n345\n00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.065\nnow it's gonna go ahead and do that.\n\n346\n00:18:02.065 --> 00:18:05.600\nThe cool thing about this,\nsince I'm doing conditional formatting,\n\n347\n00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.130\nis what if I came into here and\nmade this 200?\n\n348\n00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:12.190\nYou see how it's gonna change within the\nformula and it's gonna change visually.\n\n349\n00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:16.030\nSo if I did this as negative 50,\nthen that's gonna change.\n\n350\n00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:21.120\nSo conditional formatting can be really\ncool of visually showing you where it is.\n\n351\n00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.402\nThis goes a head and gives you the result,\nbut just different reasons,\n\n352\n00:18:24.402 --> 00:18:27.478\ndifferent ways because that's\njust something I was thinking of.\n\n353\n00:18:27.478 --> 00:18:29.492\nI wanna see where it is.\n\n354\n00:18:29.492 --> 00:18:32.760\nOkay, then try conditional formatting.\n\n355\n00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:33.943\nAnd then of course you\ncan clear your rules.\n\n356\n00:18:33.943 --> 00:18:35.330\nYou can manage your rules.\n\n357\n00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:37.245\nBut again, other episodes on that,\ncheck it out.\n\n358\n00:18:37.245 --> 00:18:41.640\nAnd there you go, minimum,\nmaximum min or min.\n\n359\n00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:42.603\nMax, min A.\n\n360\n00:18:42.603 --> 00:18:44.878\nMax A, small and large.\n\n361\n00:18:44.878 --> 00:18:45.466\n[SOUND] Okay.\n\n362\n00:18:45.466 --> 00:18:47.490\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, I tell you what, Vonne,\n\n363\n00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:51.270\nit almost seems like they are saying\nthe different sides of I don't\n\n364\n00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:52.980\nknow hyperdimensional coin.\n\n365\n00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.145\nI don't know.\nWho knows.\n\n366\n00:18:54.145 --> 00:18:57.290\nBut we definitely have more Excel\nfunctions coming at you so come on back.\n\n367\n00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:58.668\nBut for now we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n368\n00:18:58.668 --> 00:19:01.860\nSo signing off for OfficePro.TV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n369\n00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:02.490\n&gt;&gt;

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.171 --> 00:00:17.970\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison,\nand I tell you what,\n\n4\n00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.480\nI'm excited because we got more Excel\nfunctions coming right back at you.\n\n5\n00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.688\nAnd in particular,\nwe're gonna be talking about mini.\n\n6\n00:00:24.688 --> 00:00:28.580\nWait a minute.\nI was joking with you before the show.\n\n7\n00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.560\nMin ifs and max ifs.\n\n8\n00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.400\nI almost said mini s, but luckily we have\nsomeone who's going to keep everything\n\n9\n00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.780\nstraight for us, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n10\n00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.894\nHow are you doing today, Vonne?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing pretty good, and\n\n11\n00:00:36.894 --> 00:00:38.449\nnow I can't see it any other way either.\n\n12\n00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:39.506\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n13\n00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:41.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm thinking maxi fs.\n\n14\n00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.320\nAnd then I think, a nice maxi dress.\n\n15\n00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.540\nI'm sure you have quite a few\nof those in your closet.\n\n16\n00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.797\n&gt;&gt; I tell you what, if I had a dollar for\n\n17\n00:00:48.797 --> 00:00:53.698\nevery one of those I had, I don't even\nknow if I'd have to work here anymore.\n\n18\n00:00:53.698 --> 00:00:57.494\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, well luckily, for us,\n\n19\n00:00:57.494 --> 00:01:03.858\nthat Excel has brought us a couple\nnew functions in Office 365 and\n\n20\n00:01:03.858 --> 00:01:11.470\nExcel 2016, and I almost said Office\n2016 but I guess that makes sense.\n\n21\n00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.587\nAnyways, okay, they're new, in the sense\nthat they didn't exist before.\n\n22\n00:01:17.587 --> 00:01:20.760\nAll right, why don't I just go ahead and\nlet you know what it means.\n\n23\n00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.149\nYou're going to find a minimum\nvalue if it meets certain criteria,\n\n24\n00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.126\nand of course you could\nhave multiple criterias.\n\n25\n00:01:30.126 --> 00:01:31.689\nSame with the max,\n\n26\n00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:37.266\nto find the maximum value based on\na set of criteria, or criterias.\n\n27\n00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:39.436\nWait, isn't the plural of criteria,\n\n28\n00:01:39.436 --> 00:01:41.190\ncriteria?\n&gt;&gt; Criteria.\n\n29\n00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.450\nSo it's a criterion?\n\n30\n00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.850\nCriterion is the singular.\n\n31\n00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.455\nCriteria is the plural, I think.\n&gt;&gt; Well, I've been saying the plural.\n\n32\n00:01:49.455 --> 00:01:52.090\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it is criteria and there\n\n33\n00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.005\ncould be only one of those [LAUGH] so.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n34\n00:01:55.005 --> 00:01:55.573\n&gt;&gt; We'll go with that.\n\n35\n00:01:55.573 --> 00:01:56.653\n&gt;&gt; We'll go with deer.\n\n36\n00:01:56.653 --> 00:01:58.980\nThere's a lot of deer.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n37\n00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:59.936\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, so\n\n38\n00:01:59.936 --> 00:02:02.000\nI'm gonna show you how it works.\n\n39\n00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.560\nNow, we've already done the min and\n\n40\n00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.720\nthe max function in another episode and\nI said this isn't based on anything else.\n\n41\n00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.150\nAnd it's also not pulling\nthe value next to it.\n\n42\n00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.920\nThat's still true.\n\n43\n00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.780\nIt's still just gonna go ahead and\nfind the highest or\n\n44\n00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.895\nlowest value based on a criteria.\n\n45\n00:02:16.895 --> 00:02:20.710\nSo why don't we look down at the computer\nand just bringing up the help files to\n\n46\n00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.364\nshow you that this is only available\nwith an Office 365 subscription.\n\n47\n00:02:24.364 --> 00:02:26.659\nSo actually, that being said,\n\n48\n00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:31.845\nI'm going to clarify that if you had\na standalone version of 2016 and\n\n49\n00:02:31.845 --> 00:02:36.960\nnot having the office subscription\nthen this wouldn't be available.\n\n50\n00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.583\nSo it is in Office 365 only.\n\n51\n00:02:38.583 --> 00:02:41.630\nAnd the MIN's the same thing.\n\n52\n00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.683\nAnd then it's just gonna go ahead and\nbase it on our criteria.\n\n53\n00:02:44.683 --> 00:02:48.500\nWe've done AVERAGEIF and AVERAGEIFS.\n\n54\n00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.347\nWe've also done SUM and SUMIFS.\n\n55\n00:02:50.347 --> 00:02:55.750\nSo this isn't, I would say it's new but\nit's not that new, okay.\n\n56\n00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.086\nIt's just a criteria, they just expanded\nit to these two particular functions.\n\n57\n00:02:59.086 --> 00:03:01.919\nSo I have a file that we've got going on.\n\n58\n00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:07.117\nWe've got some different categories and\nunit prices, quantities and totals for\n\n59\n00:03:07.117 --> 00:03:12.250\nour Christmas cats, categories of\naccessories, clothing, food, and toys.\n\n60\n00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.320\nNow I went ahead and\nsorted this in this small data set just so\n\n61\n00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.170\nyou can see the functionality\nof these functions.\n\n62\n00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.510\nSo if I wanted to find what\nwas the maximum unit price\n\n63\n00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.280\nof our accessories, okay?\n\n64\n00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.340\nSo if it's in accessories,\nthen look at this unit price and\n\n65\n00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.380\ntell me which is the largest.\n\n66\n00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.512\nNow it's sorted, so\nit's pretty easy to see.\n\n67\n00:03:37.512 --> 00:03:41.416\nBut again, if you have lots of random\ninformation that you can't sort or\n\n68\n00:03:41.416 --> 00:03:43.528\nis not in any kind of pattern like that,\n\n69\n00:03:43.528 --> 00:03:47.650\nthen this is where these particular\nfunctions will be beneficial to you.\n\n70\n00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.959\nBut if I look at this, okay,\naccessories, unit price.\n\n71\n00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.604\nThen we can see,\nwith just these five items, that 18 wait,\n\n72\n00:03:53.604 --> 00:03:55.369\nyeah we're doing max, okay.\n\n73\n00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:57.410\n[LAUGH] That 18 is the maximum value.\n\n74\n00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.795\nAnd then if I wanted to find that for\nthe clothing, toys, and food,\n\n75\n00:04:02.795 --> 00:04:06.923\nthe nice thing is that we're just\ngonna go ahead and absolute value or\n\n76\n00:04:06.923 --> 00:04:08.859\nabsolute reference our range.\n\n77\n00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:12.124\nAnd then be able to\ncopy our function down,\n\n78\n00:04:12.124 --> 00:04:16.400\nchanging the criteria out\nbased on our cell reference.\n\n79\n00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.010\nSo that's pretty cool.\n\n80\n00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.310\nLet's start, put our cursor or select the\ncell that I want the answer to go into.\n\n81\n00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.729\nLet's go through the function dialog box,\neasier to kind of see how it works.\n\n82\n00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:29.530\nI've already got it in my\nmost recently used functions.\n\n83\n00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.710\nBut if you need to find it, go ahead and\ntype it in, and I think it's in the,\n\n84\n00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:34.980\nyou know what I just realized?\n\n85\n00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:41.500\nI think it's in the statistical\ngroup maybe, I would assume.\n\n86\n00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.650\nYep, there it is, okay.\n\n87\n00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:43.838\nI figured as much, but\n\n88\n00:04:43.838 --> 00:04:47.914\njust in case, that's where it is if you\nneed to select the category that way.\n\n89\n00:04:47.914 --> 00:04:52.100\nAll right, let's go back over to most\nrecently used and click the MAXIFS.\n\n90\n00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.536\nClick OK, and then it says,\nlet's go ahead and find the functions and\n\n91\n00:04:55.536 --> 00:04:59.395\nit's going to say, what are the cells\nthat are returning the maximum values?\n\n92\n00:04:59.395 --> 00:05:02.371\nThis is the range that I want to find.\n\n93\n00:05:02.371 --> 00:05:07.713\nWe're talking about unit price, so\nwe will click our cursor in B2,\n\n94\n00:05:07.713 --> 00:05:12.225\nhold our shift down through B21,\nand here is a range of,\n\n95\n00:05:12.225 --> 00:05:18.140\nlook at all these cells based on this\ncriteria, cursor into the next field.\n\n96\n00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.770\nThe criteria range is our category.\n\n97\n00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.281\nAnd again, I'm not pulling my headings,\njust for this example.\n\n98\n00:05:25.281 --> 00:05:29.167\nIf you use your headings, make sure you\nuse it in all of your references and\n\n99\n00:05:29.167 --> 00:05:33.450\nall of your ranges, so\nthat way it matches and it understands.\n\n100\n00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:34.900\nSo that's what we're looking at,\n\n101\n00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.300\nour category, clicking our cursor into\ncriteria, we need to find the criteria.\n\n102\n00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.370\nWe are using the cell reference so\n\n103\n00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.640\nwe're going to say whatever is in H3,\nwhich is Accessories,\n\n104\n00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.690\nand you can see that the result is showing\n18, so I know I'm on the right track.\n\n105\n00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.790\nWe could have multiple criteria but we're\ngoing to save that for the next example.\n\n106\n00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.400\nYou click OK, and\nthen there you go, awesome.\n\n107\n00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.593\nI wanna do it for all, but like I said,\n\n108\n00:06:03.593 --> 00:06:06.349\nI've gotta absolute\nreference those ranges.\n\n109\n00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:12.305\nYou need to always look in the unit\nprice and always look in the category.\n\n110\n00:06:12.305 --> 00:06:17.100\nI'm gonna double click in this cell and\nthen get into the function.\n\n111\n00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.160\nI don't have the F4 key on my laptop but\nremember,\n\n112\n00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.267\nif you are you are on a full keyboard,\nF4 is a way to go ahead and\n\n113\n00:06:24.267 --> 00:06:28.110\nput in the dollar signs in front of\nthe column and the row reference.\n\n114\n00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.184\nSame thing over here.\n\n115\n00:06:29.184 --> 00:06:32.400\nBecause I wanna fix this,\ndon't move this one.\n\n116\n00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.587\nDon't move the unit price range.\n\n117\n00:06:33.587 --> 00:06:38.340\nAnd I also need to fix the range for\nthe categories.\n\n118\n00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.700\nSo always look at the unit price.\n\n119\n00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:41.809\nAlways look at the categories.\n\n120\n00:06:41.809 --> 00:06:47.056\nI am not going to absolute reference H3\ncuz that is the one that I want to have\n\n121\n00:06:47.056 --> 00:06:53.000\nrelatively changing as I copy down the\nfunction, so nothing should change, okay?\n\n122\n00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.350\nIf it does, you did something wrong.\n\n123\n00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:59.170\nAnd then I will take this,\ndouble-click on the fill handle, and\n\n124\n00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:00.860\nthen we automatically fill that down.\n\n125\n00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.274\nAnd then if we look, yep, that's right.\n\n126\n00:07:02.274 --> 00:07:06.927\nLooking at our data,\nthere's our maximum unit\n\n127\n00:07:06.927 --> 00:07:12.260\nprice if it meets\nthe criteria of our category.\n\n128\n00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.367\nThere you go, that's our maximum value.\n&gt;&gt; This seems pretty\n\n129\n00:07:15.367 --> 00:07:16.519\nstraightforward, Vonne.\n\n130\n00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:20.904\nAnd if you plan this correctly, you can\nalways use the relative reference for\n\n131\n00:07:20.904 --> 00:07:23.110\nthe label you're looking for.\n\n132\n00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.050\nOne quick question, though,\nif we change that to lowercase a.\n\n133\n00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.710\nI just wanna make sure, I don't think\nExcel messes with that if that says\n\n134\n00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:33.650\naccessories with a lowercase a instead\nof Accessories with an uppercase A.\n\n135\n00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:36.400\nBut I'm just making sure cuz\nsometimes I've gotten burnt in\n\n136\n00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.975\nother situations with that.\n&gt;&gt; That's a good question and\n\n137\n00:07:38.975 --> 00:07:41.788\nat I first I'm like,\nyou mean in the references?\n\n138\n00:07:41.788 --> 00:07:43.540\nOkay, in here.\n\n139\n00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:48.868\nSo let's type in A, and, no, it is not\ncase specific, but that's a good point.\n\n140\n00:07:48.868 --> 00:07:51.775\nJust in case, that you need.\n\n141\n00:07:51.775 --> 00:07:52.675\nJust in case.\n\n142\n00:07:52.675 --> 00:07:53.915\nDid you hear that?\n\n143\n00:07:53.915 --> 00:07:56.926\n[LAUGH] I didn't do that on purpose.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n144\n00:07:56.926 --> 00:07:58.339\n&gt;&gt; It just sounded funny in my brain.\n\n145\n00:07:58.339 --> 00:08:01.337\nI'm like,\nI'm hanging out with Justin right now.\n\n146\n00:08:01.337 --> 00:08:02.110\nAll right, sorry.\n\n147\n00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:04.340\n[LAUGH] There you go.\n\n148\n00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.200\nThat is not case specific,\nso that is nice.\n\n149\n00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.610\nAnd of course,\nwe could be hard coding these criteria,\n\n150\n00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.214\nwhich we'll do in another example.\n\n151\n00:08:10.214 --> 00:08:13.004\nBut let's go ahead and get the minimum\njust to show some variation on here.\n\n152\n00:08:13.004 --> 00:08:16.493\nDo I really wanna have to type\nall of these all over again?\n\n153\n00:08:16.493 --> 00:08:21.156\nThe only thing that's really going\nto change in here for the minimum,\n\n154\n00:08:21.156 --> 00:08:25.739\nis I need to change the max ifs to\nmin ifs, and then change the relative\n\n155\n00:08:25.739 --> 00:08:29.860\nreference for what the criteria\nis to this particular cell.\n\n156\n00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.940\nAnd I wanna just move the minimum total.\n\n157\n00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:37.390\nSo it's almost kind of like half\ndozen which way, six dozen.\n\n158\n00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:41.054\nI always mess this up every single time.\n&gt;&gt; Six in\n\n159\n00:08:41.054 --> 00:08:43.897\none-half dozen in the other?\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n160\n00:08:43.897 --> 00:08:44.624\nexactly.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n161\n00:08:44.624 --> 00:08:45.870\n&gt;&gt; I cannot get that saying,\n\n162\n00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:49.108\nI think I've messed it up every\nsingle episode I've ever tried to.\n\n163\n00:08:49.108 --> 00:08:54.119\n[LAUGH] I've had to have you or\nDaniel fix me, [LAUGH] every time.\n\n164\n00:08:54.119 --> 00:08:55.330\nSo yes, I can rewrite it.\n\n165\n00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:56.180\nI'm just gonna do this,\n\n166\n00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:59.740\nI'm gonna copy this and\nit's copied in the function, okay?\n\n167\n00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:01.940\nAnd then I'm going to paste it.\n\n168\n00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:06.860\nAnd if I look in here,\nnow I'm just gonna change the references.\n\n169\n00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.533\nI want the minimum total.\n\n170\n00:09:08.533 --> 00:09:10.428\nSo it's not gonna be unit price.\n\n171\n00:09:10.428 --> 00:09:14.240\nBut it's the same range\njust one column over.\n\n172\n00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.766\nSo I'll just change it right in here,\nokay?\n\n173\n00:09:15.766 --> 00:09:20.350\nI will take this, let's go over here.\n\n174\n00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:22.581\nAll right, so B2, that is the unit price.\n\n175\n00:09:22.581 --> 00:09:25.588\nSo we're just gonna change that to D2.\n\n176\n00:09:25.588 --> 00:09:30.530\nSo this is where you start to\nget a little more confident\n\n177\n00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:35.159\nin being able to read those formulas or\nfunctions.\n\n178\n00:09:35.159 --> 00:09:37.790\nBut okay now I can, and\nalso the color coding's really nice.\n\n179\n00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:41.530\nSo yep,\nI'm trying to find the minimum total.\n\n180\n00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:44.350\nBased on the category,\nokay, so that column stays.\n\n181\n00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.930\nSo I just need to keep the criteria as A.\n\n182\n00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:53.204\nIt's already changed the reference from\nwhen I pasted to the criteria being H8.\n\n183\n00:09:53.204 --> 00:09:56.336\nThe last thing I need to do is just\nchange out the name of the function,\n\n184\n00:09:56.336 --> 00:09:57.470\njust change this to min.\n\n185\n00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:59.551\nAnd it's okay that I'm\nusing lower case letters.\n\n186\n00:09:59.551 --> 00:10:03.100\nSo as soon as I hit Enter,\nit goes ahead and does that.\n\n187\n00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:08.090\nSo try it, try to get a little\nbit more comfortable with\n\n188\n00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:12.650\nreading the functions and\nunderstanding where the commas are.\n\n189\n00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:15.203\nWhat your ranges are,\nand just changing them.\n\n190\n00:10:15.203 --> 00:10:19.009\nAnd so now, I can just take this and\ncopy down, and there we go.\n\n191\n00:10:19.009 --> 00:10:20.880\nSo just kind of looking.\n\n192\n00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.096\nYep, seven, clothing.\n\n193\n00:10:23.096 --> 00:10:25.249\nOkay, yep, that's our minimum value.\n\n194\n00:10:25.249 --> 00:10:27.320\nSo yeah, I trust you.\n\n195\n00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.480\nYou're doing all right.\n\n196\n00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:32.700\nSo then what if we need\nsome other criteria?\n\n197\n00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.850\nWe have multiple criteria.\n\n198\n00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:40.620\nThe maximum total in toys\nwhen quantity is less than 5.\n\n199\n00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:44.890\nSo looking at it really quickly,\nokay, here are the toys, okay?\n\n200\n00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:49.046\nMy maximum total, but\nonly if the quantity is less than 5.\n\n201\n00:10:49.046 --> 00:10:52.870\nI know this is kind of like some weird\ncircular thing, but quantity less than 5.\n\n202\n00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:54.692\nOkay, so that’s 2, 3 and 4.\n\n203\n00:10:54.692 --> 00:10:55.930\nOkay, so 2, 3, 4.\n\n204\n00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:59.923\nAnd then what is the total?\n\n205\n00:10:59.923 --> 00:11:04.064\nOkay, 76, 60, 46.\n\n206\n00:11:04.064 --> 00:11:06.246\nSo 76 would be the one.\n\n207\n00:11:06.246 --> 00:11:08.138\nYou're like, well yeah, because that's 4.\n\n208\n00:11:08.138 --> 00:11:09.497\nBut remember, the unit price could change.\n\n209\n00:11:09.497 --> 00:11:12.410\nSo all of that is fluctuating.\n\n210\n00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:15.020\nSo I need to be able to\nwrite a function for it.\n\n211\n00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:18.680\nUsing the insert function dialogue box,\nwe will go to the max if's.\n\n212\n00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:23.703\nWe want to take the range from our total.\n\n213\n00:11:23.703 --> 00:11:27.580\nSo that's D2 through shift D21.\n\n214\n00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:33.210\nThe criteria one is what category?\n\n215\n00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:36.440\nSo A2 through A21.\n\n216\n00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:43.494\nThe criteria is toys, cuz I do not have\na cell reference to reference that from.\n\n217\n00:11:43.494 --> 00:11:47.146\nThe second range is going\nto be the quantity,\n\n218\n00:11:47.146 --> 00:11:51.488\nmaking sure you move your\ncursor through the fields.\n\n219\n00:11:51.488 --> 00:11:54.120\nIt gets me every time,\nI start going too fast.\n\n220\n00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.540\nSo this criteria is that it\nneeds to be less than five.\n\n221\n00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:01.710\nOkay, less than is this one,\nlooks like an L, so L.\n\n222\n00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:07.120\nAnd then five, not less than equal\ntoo cuz that would include the five,\n\n223\n00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.572\nno less than five.\n\n224\n00:12:08.572 --> 00:12:12.324\nMeaning below it, and\nI click okay and then, yep,\n\n225\n00:12:12.324 --> 00:12:15.500\n76 there is the answer.\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne.\n\n226\n00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.495\nSo we've seen that we can have like\ntwo different criteria over two\n\n227\n00:12:18.495 --> 00:12:21.063\ndifferent ranges, but\nI'm guessing we can discontinue\n\n228\n00:12:21.063 --> 00:12:23.813\nto chain those together, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, you could\n\n229\n00:12:23.813 --> 00:12:27.770\ngo this criteria one, two, three,\nfour, and all these different values.\n\n230\n00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:33.409\nI believe actually over in our\ndocumentation, if I look at it.\n\n231\n00:12:33.409 --> 00:12:35.793\nAll right, additional ranges,\n\n232\n00:12:35.793 --> 00:12:40.317\nwhere you can associate criteria\nends up a 2, wait, 100.\n\n233\n00:12:40.317 --> 00:12:42.004\nWhat is that number?\n\n234\n00:12:42.004 --> 00:12:44.078\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n235\n00:12:44.078 --> 00:12:45.400\n&gt;&gt; 126 pairs.\n\n236\n00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.022\n&gt;&gt; 126 pairs?\n\n237\n00:12:48.022 --> 00:12:53.554\nSo that would be 252 plus the previous\n2 that you have, which is 254\n\n238\n00:12:53.554 --> 00:12:58.000\nplus the first range which is 255, 255,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n239\n00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:58.756\n&gt;&gt; We keep seeing\n\n240\n00:12:58.756 --> 00:13:00.400\nthat limit all over the place.\n\n241\n00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.460\nSo it looks like maybe that's\njust an argument number limit.\n\n242\n00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:06.910\nSo that makes sense, but they come in\npairs so we gotta be careful there cause\n\n243\n00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:09.870\nthe documentation reports those as pairs.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n244\n00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:13.870\nwe're already where it's\nstating criteria range two.\n\n245\n00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:17.095\nSo that's where its like,\nthat doesn't sound like a computer number.\n\n246\n00:13:17.095 --> 00:13:20.040\nJustin just explained it that to us.\n\n247\n00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.247\nAnd I always like having a math\ngenius right next to me,\n\n248\n00:13:23.247 --> 00:13:25.141\n[LAUGH] when we're doing stuff.\n\n249\n00:13:25.141 --> 00:13:27.490\nAnd yeah, that makes sense.\n\n250\n00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:31.724\nI think we went on a lame one time that\nmaybe that's like the total number of\n\n251\n00:13:31.724 --> 00:13:33.717\narguments any function can have?\n\n252\n00:13:33.717 --> 00:13:35.562\nI'm not ready to make that claim.\n&gt;&gt; Who\n\n253\n00:13:35.562 --> 00:13:36.330\nknows.\n\n254\n00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:37.283\n&gt;&gt; But-\n&gt;&gt; Who knows.\n\n255\n00:13:37.283 --> 00:13:37.898\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n256\n00:13:37.898 --> 00:13:39.358\n&gt;&gt; But it appears to be that way,\n\n257\n00:13:39.358 --> 00:13:40.770\nnothing to see here.\n\n258\n00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:43.440\nBut maybe it is.\n\n259\n00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:47.362\nIt doesn't seem like it's too hard to\nchain together or you're getting ready to\n\n260\n00:13:47.362 --> 00:13:50.715\nthrow a monkey ranch into the works.\n&gt;&gt; I'm not going like, okay,\n\n261\n00:13:50.715 --> 00:13:53.450\nI'm gonna have four\ndifferent sets of criteria.\n\n262\n00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:57.739\nI'm really just gonna do the same thing\nagain with a couple little variations,\n\n263\n00:13:57.739 --> 00:14:00.630\njust in case you haven't\nseen every single episode.\n\n264\n00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:02.884\nIf you're like, hey,\nI've seen you do this quite a few times.\n\n265\n00:14:02.884 --> 00:14:05.578\nYeah, we try to tend to\nrepeat the same stuff.\n\n266\n00:14:05.578 --> 00:14:10.283\nBut anyways, because once you know about\nabsolute references, relative references,\n\n267\n00:14:10.283 --> 00:14:12.190\nand those different things.\n\n268\n00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:14.843\nIt all becomes just replace\nwhatever function name it is.\n\n269\n00:14:14.843 --> 00:14:16.563\nBut I wanted to just give you an example,\n\n270\n00:14:16.563 --> 00:14:19.307\nbecause we did one right here\nwhere we had two criteria, right?\n\n271\n00:14:19.307 --> 00:14:25.520\nWe had go ahead and find the maximum and\nwe hard coded the actual criteria.\n\n272\n00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.010\nWe didn't use cell references.\n\n273\n00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:31.910\nJust to show you another example with the\ncell reference and how you've just got to\n\n274\n00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:35.440\nbe slightly careful every once in\na while when you're doing things.\n\n275\n00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.240\nSo let's look at what we have.\n\n276\n00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.960\nWe wanna find the maximum total\n\n277\n00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:44.690\nin a category when a quantity\nis less than a quota.\n\n278\n00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:46.815\nNow we are listing that a quota here,\n\n279\n00:14:46.815 --> 00:14:49.560\ncuz each category we have\na specific selling quota And\n\n280\n00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:53.430\nthen this particular worksheet, just to\nlet you know, I fixed all the unit prices.\n\n281\n00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:56.720\nSo they're just, okay, every accessory is\nsix just to kind of give it a little bit\n\n282\n00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.110\nmore of a real world example.\n\n283\n00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:03.390\nAnd so,\nif the quota is eight in accessories.\n\n284\n00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:08.370\nWell, anything below eight, right,\nlike six and three, well then,\n\n285\n00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:11.080\nwhat was the maximum total?\n\n286\n00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.460\nIt's kind of like, okay,\nwe almost got there but\n\n287\n00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.860\nthen, where were we right below it?\n\n288\n00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.011\nOkay, so\nthat's what I wanna throw out there.\n\n289\n00:15:18.011 --> 00:15:21.751\nEssentially we're gonna be writing one,\nand then copying down.\n\n290\n00:15:21.751 --> 00:15:24.299\nWe're gonna use that absolute\nreference again to go ahead and\n\n291\n00:15:24.299 --> 00:15:26.400\nfix those ranges that we wanna look at.\n\n292\n00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:31.380\nAnd there's one gotcha that I'd like to\nthrow in there just to make sure you don't\n\n293\n00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:35.144\njust kind of go through and\nbe like, why isn't this working?\n\n294\n00:15:35.144 --> 00:15:37.400\nBecause well, I've done it a couple times.\n\n295\n00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:40.830\nSo I wanna make sure you\nguys can maybe avoid that.\n\n296\n00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:42.662\nLet's put our cursor here.\n\n297\n00:15:42.662 --> 00:15:46.046\nGo into our insert function dialog box,\nyes, this is the one we want.\n\n298\n00:15:46.046 --> 00:15:50.672\nWe know that we've seen this a couple\nof times, we want the maximum total.\n\n299\n00:15:50.672 --> 00:15:54.357\nAnd we find that, why don't we go\nahead and add some references,\n\n300\n00:15:54.357 --> 00:15:57.581\nbecause we know that we want\nthis to always stick, okay?\n\n301\n00:15:57.581 --> 00:16:00.468\nSo let's put the dollar signs in,\nbecause I don't have a keyboard.\n\n302\n00:16:00.468 --> 00:16:04.406\nIt has an f4 my next criteria\nrange is my category,\n\n303\n00:16:04.406 --> 00:16:07.745\nlet's go ahead and select that, whoops.\n\n304\n00:16:07.745 --> 00:16:12.504\n[LAUGH] All right you know what,\nI'm going to go ahead and do this.\n\n305\n00:16:12.504 --> 00:16:16.669\nWe're gonna physically type this in,\nI know we're getting crazy.\n\n306\n00:16:16.669 --> 00:16:21.633\nJustin, you're gonna have to make sure\nI'm typing this in right, A2 through A21.\n\n307\n00:16:21.633 --> 00:16:26.080\nI forgot my dollar sign,\nno I already did it, dollar sign there.\n\n308\n00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.910\n21, okay?\n\n309\n00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:34.440\nThe criteria is going to be our\ncell reference of accessories.\n\n310\n00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.405\nThe next criteria range is going to be\n\n311\n00:16:37.405 --> 00:16:43.310\nour quantity, so\nwe will say we want our quantity.\n\n312\n00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:46.094\nOops, sorry, getting a little crazy.\n\n313\n00:16:46.094 --> 00:16:48.572\nNow I will,\nyou know what I'm trying to do?\n\n314\n00:16:48.572 --> 00:16:54.790\nI'm trying to use my cursor or my\nselection of my range and my arrow keys.\n\n315\n00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:56.890\nSo here's a lesson.\n\n316\n00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:59.880\nMake sure you go ahead and\ncomplete this and that is E.\n\n317\n00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:05.990\nSo let's say C down through C,\nthere we go.\n\n318\n00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:08.974\nClick in here and now I put my cursor,\n\n319\n00:17:08.974 --> 00:17:14.188\nwhat I've done is I was trying to combine,\nselecting my cells.\n\n320\n00:17:14.188 --> 00:17:18.463\nSo it was in like the cell selector\nrange and then I'm using my arrow key.\n\n321\n00:17:18.463 --> 00:17:23.193\nSo what it's trying to do is move\nmy cell selector over to the cells\n\n322\n00:17:23.193 --> 00:17:25.180\nthat I am trying to select.\n\n323\n00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:28.050\nOkay, does everybody see\nwhat I'm doing there?\n\n324\n00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:29.162\nI'm going too fast again.\n\n325\n00:17:29.162 --> 00:17:34.352\nAnd so if I'm trying to use my cursor\nwithin the field to type in, you gotta\n\n326\n00:17:34.352 --> 00:17:40.064\nmake sure that you have it activated in\nthere, not in your cell selector, okay?\n\n327\n00:17:40.064 --> 00:17:42.880\nSo I'm leading by example\nof what not to do.\n\n328\n00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:48.967\nI shouldn't even not what, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What\n\n329\n00:17:48.967 --> 00:17:49.748\nnot to do.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n330\n00:17:49.748 --> 00:17:51.966\n&gt;&gt; I'm guessing is what you're trying\n\n331\n00:17:51.966 --> 00:17:52.471\nto say.\n\n332\n00:17:52.471 --> 00:17:54.055\n[LAUGH] Man, words are hard sometimes.\n\n333\n00:17:54.055 --> 00:17:55.766\nI've got to give that to you.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n334\n00:17:55.766 --> 00:18:01.300\nnow I'm back into where I'm outside\nof the insert function dialog box.\n\n335\n00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:05.220\nAnd I'm using here that I would\nlike to have my quota, but\n\n336\n00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.330\nwhat I wanna do is do a less than.\n\n337\n00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:10.360\nNow this is where yu could go ahead and\n\n338\n00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:14.340\njust type in less than,\noops, [LAUGH] I'm sorry.\n\n339\n00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.720\nThere we go, now I've got a less than.\n\n340\n00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:21.634\nIf you hit Enter it's going to throw\nyou an error and you're like, well why,\n\n341\n00:18:21.634 --> 00:18:24.886\nit didn't throw me an error in\nthe the last one cuz I went ahead and\n\n342\n00:18:24.886 --> 00:18:29.492\nI put quotes around it saying less than\nand we type in the physical number five.\n\n343\n00:18:29.492 --> 00:18:33.540\nWhen you're using cell references in here,\nyou gotta be careful,\n\n344\n00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:39.710\nyou've got to say that I would like\nyou to treat this less than as text.\n\n345\n00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:44.890\nPut that around, but\nthen add that in to a cell reference.\n\n346\n00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:45.850\nSo we use the ampersand.\n\n347\n00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:49.210\nWe actually did this back in\nlike I believe the sum ifs.\n\n348\n00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:51.270\nThere's other episodes\nwhere we had to do this,\n\n349\n00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:55.460\nwhere we were hard coding it with\nan operator, a comparison, and\n\n350\n00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:59.310\nthen with a cell reference you've\ngot to put those together.\n\n351\n00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:03.082\nYou have to concatenate it\nwith that ampersand, whoo.\n\n352\n00:19:03.082 --> 00:19:05.750\nI know, that was a rough one, right?\n\n353\n00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:08.050\nAnd this is what's gonna happen in Excel.\n\n354\n00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:12.780\nAnd those little gotchas of why is\nit keep moving my cursor and yeah,\n\n355\n00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:15.280\nit's doing exactly what I told it to do.\n\n356\n00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.890\nI just need to make sure I remember\nwhere I need to be at the right time,\n\n357\n00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:19.880\nso absolute references.\n\n358\n00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:20.750\nThere's my criteria.\n\n359\n00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:22.680\nI can already see that the answer is 36.\n\n360\n00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.390\nSo I am on a roll and that's good.\n\n361\n00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:29.960\nYeah, that was a lot of work but\nthe reward here is going to\n\n362\n00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:34.710\nbe when I say, I want all of these\nto go now ahead and process.\n\n363\n00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:37.230\nI want you to give me that maximum for\n\n364\n00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:41.030\nall of it, took that time,\nall I gotta do is double-click it.\n\n365\n00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:42.200\nAnd now it will go ahead and\n\n366\n00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:47.650\ngive me for all of them cuz I'm using\nmy relative reference on the quota\n\n367\n00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:53.200\nwith that less than doing my relative\nreference on my other criteria.\n\n368\n00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.398\nAnd then going ahead and populating down.\n\n369\n00:19:55.398 --> 00:19:59.924\nSo [SOUND] That was a rough one but I hope\nyou can see how this can really work to\n\n370\n00:19:59.924 --> 00:20:04.669\nyour advantage if you take the time and\nunderstand the absolute reference and\n\n371\n00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:08.908\nrelative reference, what the function\nis actually asking you for.\n\n372\n00:20:08.908 --> 00:20:12.876\nAnd that little operator with\nthe comparison operator with the ampersand\n\n373\n00:20:12.876 --> 00:20:14.350\nwith your cell reference.\n\n374\n00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:17.565\nThere we go.\n&gt;&gt; Well I'll tell you what Vonne,\n\n375\n00:20:17.565 --> 00:20:21.140\nthat concatenation of the operator with\nthe cell reference, that could be a doozy.\n\n376\n00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.911\nThat'll be a hard one to pick\nout if you're not careful.\n\n377\n00:20:23.911 --> 00:20:27.663\nSo definitely remember that so thank you\nso much for highlighting that for us and\n\n378\n00:20:27.663 --> 00:20:31.359\nwell I'm gonna try not to forget it and\nyou don't forget to come on back and join\n\n379\n00:20:31.359 --> 00:20:34.943\nus for more Office Pro Excel functions,\nbut for now we're gonna go ahead and\n\n380\n00:20:34.943 --> 00:20:37.060\nget out of here\n&gt;&gt; So signing off for Office Pro TV,\n\n381\n00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:39.134\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n382\n00:20:39.134 --> 00:20:42.705\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n383\n00:20:42.705 --> 00:20:44.176\n[SOUND]\n\n",

OfficePro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.275 --> 00:00:16.966\nI'm you host Justin Dennison and well,\n\n4\n00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:20.162\nI hope you're ready because we've got\nmore Excel functions coming at you.\n\n5\n00:00:20.162 --> 00:00:23.302\nAnd we're going to be talking about\nRAND and RANDBETWEEN in this episode.\n\n6\n00:00:23.302 --> 00:00:26.421\nAnd well, to help us along in that\nvery endeavors, someone very special,\n\n7\n00:00:26.421 --> 00:00:27.220\nMiss Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.040\nHow you doing today, Vonne?\n\n9\n00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.780\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic, how are you doing?\n\n10\n00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.146\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic as well.\n\n11\n00:00:31.146 --> 00:00:33.660\nAnd RAND and\nRANDBETWEEN because of my experience,\n\n12\n00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.570\nI'm guessing we're gonna be talking\nabout random numbers and stuff.\n\n13\n00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.670\nAm I right?\n\n14\n00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.172\n&gt;&gt; Ding ding, yes we are.\n\n15\n00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:44.300\n[LAUGH] And this is actually\nsomething that I use all the time.\n\n16\n00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.190\nFor me because I'm generating exercise\nfiles for you guys to go ahead and\n\n17\n00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.950\ndo calculations and everything.\n\n18\n00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.220\nAnd all these numbers that I get for\nunit prices for\n\n19\n00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.970\ncat toys and the number of meows that\nthey did and all those different things.\n\n20\n00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.550\nI don't manually type those in.\n\n21\n00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.380\nI use a function.\n\n22\n00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.858\nAnd that randomly goes ahead,\n\n23\n00:01:08.858 --> 00:01:13.550\nand selects numbers between 5 and 12.\n\n24\n00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.813\nAnd then it just populates and\nl just go [SOUND] okay great, perfect.\n\n25\n00:01:16.813 --> 00:01:19.993\nI have the unit price for all the\ndifferent cat toys and the accessories and\n\n26\n00:01:19.993 --> 00:01:21.280\nall those different things.\n\n27\n00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.290\nSo I don't type all that in.\n\n28\n00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.180\nI use this.\n\n29\n00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.170\nSo I personally use this frequently.\n\n30\n00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.770\nI use the RANDBETWEEN,\nI don't use the RAND.\n\n31\n00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.110\nAnd I will show you why because of\nwhat they do in what the functions do.\n\n32\n00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.619\nWow, that was circular.\n\n33\n00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:40.405\n&gt;&gt; Well I tell you what,\n\n34\n00:01:40.405 --> 00:01:43.330\nthat was straight from the department\nof redundancy department.\n\n35\n00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.281\nCouldn't have said it better.\n\n36\n00:01:44.281 --> 00:01:45.664\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I feel like you're revealing\n\n37\n00:01:45.664 --> 00:01:48.620\na little bit too much magic from behind\nthe scenes on how you prep these.\n\n38\n00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.438\nBut I guess I'll let you go ahead and\nshow us how it's done.\n\n39\n00:01:51.438 --> 00:01:53.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're an open book here.\n\n40\n00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.105\nI'll let you know what I do and\nsometimes what I don't do.\n\n41\n00:01:57.105 --> 00:01:59.200\n[LAUGH] Which is manually insert numbers.\n\n42\n00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.420\nSo I will show you how I do this.\n\n43\n00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.050\nSo I just have a blank workbook.\n\n44\n00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.180\nNothing special going on here.\n\n45\n00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.920\nI have just a random cell selected.\n\n46\n00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.300\nSo I would like to generate\nsome random numbers.\n\n47\n00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.350\nThat sounds good.\n\n48\n00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.570\nWe'll use the insert function dialog\nbox to make this a little easier.\n\n49\n00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.710\nWe'll type in rand and hit go.\n\n50\n00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:21.910\nThat's the only one I got.\n\n51\n00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.360\nSo and then if we look at\nthis it says return to random\n\n52\n00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.130\nnumber greater than or\nequal to zero and less then one.\n\n53\n00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.340\nOkay.\n\n54\n00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.760\nSo that right there is why\nI don't use RAND by itself.\n\n55\n00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.980\nBut let's go a head and\nsee what it actually does.\n\n56\n00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.260\nWe'll click okay, and\nthen the thing is, that's all it is.\n\n57\n00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.000\nIt just says,\nthat the function takes no arguments.\n\n58\n00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.818\nI don't have a range of numbers.\n\n59\n00:02:50.818 --> 00:02:55.290\nI don't have to type anything into it and\nit just does it.\n\n60\n00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.840\nNow, this right here,\nthe formula result is volatile.\n\n61\n00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.016\nThat sounds scary, right,\n\n62\n00:03:00.016 --> 00:03:03.162\nlike it's gonna come out of the screen\nlike [SOUND] like bite me or something.\n\n63\n00:03:03.162 --> 00:03:06.280\nOr maybe that's just me and\nmy scary brain, I don't know.\n\n64\n00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.550\nBut that's what volatile means.\n\n65\n00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:08.810\nIt's like it's always changing.\n\n66\n00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.790\nIt seems very unsteady or unpredictable.\n\n67\n00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.580\nThat's fine.\n\n68\n00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.160\nLet's just click OK.\n\n69\n00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.620\nAnd then it just goes ahead and\nthere you go.\n\n70\n00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.217\nThere's my random number.\n\n71\n00:03:18.217 --> 00:03:24.620\nAnd if I increase the decimals,\nthis is just a display thing.\n\n72\n00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:25.860\nSo it's just gonna keep on going.\n\n73\n00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.883\nSo this is where I can reduce or\nincrease a decimal point and\n\n74\n00:03:30.883 --> 00:03:35.098\nit's going to give me\na number between 0 and 1.\n\n75\n00:03:35.098 --> 00:03:39.788\nAnd if I wanted to then generate a random\nlist of numbers, you just take your fill\n\n76\n00:03:39.788 --> 00:03:44.700\nhandle, you copy it down, and, ooh, I went\na little bit further than I wanted to.\n\n77\n00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.540\nAnd, there you go.\n\n78\n00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.648\nThere are my random numbers that\nwere generated from this formula.\n\n79\n00:03:50.648 --> 00:03:54.361\n&gt;&gt; And what's interesting Vonne,\nis based on my background, this function,\n\n80\n00:03:54.361 --> 00:03:57.970\nthis ability is actually encapsulated\nin a lot of programming languages.\n\n81\n00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.040\nYour like, wait a minute,\nwe're not programming.\n\n82\n00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.240\nFormulas and functions in Excel,\nyou're kinda programming.\n\n83\n00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.820\nSo it's all right, but that volatility,\n\n84\n00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.360\nthe zero to one, very common and\nit's evenly distributed.\n\n85\n00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.580\nWhich means if I generate some\nastronomically large then I will get\n\n86\n00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.350\nrelative even distribution of what numbers\nare selected between zero and one.\n\n87\n00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.270\nSo I get kinda uniform, right?\n\n88\n00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.880\nLastly, I feel compelled,\nthis is called random.\n\n89\n00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.550\nIt's from a computer, don't use this for\nany security or anything.\n\n90\n00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.460\nThis is just for,\nI need a random seed for something.\n\n91\n00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.200\nDon't use it for truly random generation.\n\n92\n00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and, I mean, and that's why,\n\n93\n00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.890\nfor me, using this in these exercise\nfiles, I just need some unit prices.\n\n94\n00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.150\nI just make them up.\n\n95\n00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.490\nAnd so just go ahead and do it.\n\n96\n00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.890\nNow, when I say that, I'm not using this,\n\n97\n00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.750\nbecause I need something\nthat's bigger than 1, usually.\n\n98\n00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.420\nAnd I don't want the decimals and\neverything.\n\n99\n00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.150\nAnd someone's like, couldn't you\njust take those, move the decimal.\n\n100\n00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.580\nYou could do some formulas past that and\neverything.\n\n101\n00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.200\nLike times it by 10,000 and whatever.\n\n102\n00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.650\nFor now, we're just gonna show you\nit will generate random numbers.\n\n103\n00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.040\nOkay, yay.\n\n104\n00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.470\nLet's move onto another sheet.\n\n105\n00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.960\nAnd there's a reason why I'm\nmaking this on a new worksheet.\n\n106\n00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.389\nI'll come back around to it in a second.\n\n107\n00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:17.840\nNet unit pricing.\n\n108\n00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.088\nI need numbers between five and\n12, that's what I need.\n\n109\n00:05:21.088 --> 00:05:24.260\nThere's a RANDBETWEEN.\n\n110\n00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.928\nIt's already in my most recently used,\nI believe that these are in your math and\n\n111\n00:05:28.928 --> 00:05:30.470\ntrig, if I'm mistaken.\n\n112\n00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:31.940\nIt's not statistical.\n\n113\n00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.510\nIf I look in math and trig, and\nwe're going with RAND, yup, there it is.\n\n114\n00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.180\nThey're small, but\nwe've got RANDBETWEEN, and\n\n115\n00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.800\nit says return to ran a number\nbetween the two numbers you specified.\n\n116\n00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.150\nExactly what I want.\n\n117\n00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.798\nWhat's my bottom number?\n\n118\n00:05:47.798 --> 00:05:48.703\n5.\n\n119\n00:05:48.703 --> 00:05:49.680\nWhat's the top number?\n\n120\n00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.004\n12, done.\n\n121\n00:05:52.004 --> 00:05:53.770\nOkay, I usually type this one out, too.\n\n122\n00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.390\nI don't use the answer function\ndialog box cuz I use it so much.\n\n123\n00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.212\nSo then I just do what's my bottom,\nand then what's my top,\n\n124\n00:06:00.212 --> 00:06:02.460\nclose the parenthesis, and be done.\n\n125\n00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.100\nYou click OK.\n\n126\n00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.330\nAnd it says 12.\n\n127\n00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.870\nPerfect, copy it down,\nthere's my unit price.\n\n128\n00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:10.720\nAll right, yay.\n\n129\n00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.590\nFormat it, move along,\nand that's what I do.\n\n130\n00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.340\nAnd I can say, and\nthere you go, and bye bye.\n\n131\n00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.210\nNo, I have a few more little caveats\nhere and there to talk to you about.\n\n132\n00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.959\nBut that's the moral of the story or\n\n133\n00:06:22.959 --> 00:06:25.480\nthe gist of it is how to\nget the random numbers.\n\n134\n00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.535\n&gt;&gt; Real quick question about this Vonne.\n\n135\n00:06:26.535 --> 00:06:30.204\nIf we increase the number\nof decimal places on these,\n\n136\n00:06:30.204 --> 00:06:32.658\nis it zero or is it just [SOUND] stuff?\n\n137\n00:06:32.658 --> 00:06:38.040\n&gt;&gt; That is an excellent question yes\nbecause if I, let's try this again.\n\n138\n00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.700\nLet me escape.\n\n139\n00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.600\nLet's just zoom in just a little bit.\n\n140\n00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:46.432\nSo if I say equals RANDBETWEEN and\nthen I type in,\n\n141\n00:06:46.432 --> 00:06:51.139\nlet's even have some fun -4.25.\n\n142\n00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:52.076\nIs that what you're asking?\n\n143\n00:06:52.076 --> 00:06:53.690\nLike the decimals in here?\n\n144\n00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.198\n&gt;&gt; So not only this.\n\n145\n00:06:56.198 --> 00:07:01.070\nThis is handy if I can use fractional\nnumbers as the bottom and the top.\n\n146\n00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:04.680\nBut also if I have things that appear to\nbe whole numbers, like in the previous\n\n147\n00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.750\nsheet, if I increase the decimal places\ndo I actually have whole numbers?\n\n148\n00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.260\nLike is it all zeroes?\n\n149\n00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.842\nOr do I have like 2389482789?\n\n150\n00:07:12.842 --> 00:07:14.220\n&gt;&gt; Let's look, okay.\n\n151\n00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.190\nSo I'm going to hit Enter on this one.\n\n152\n00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:18.490\nSo we're kind of combining both those.\n\n153\n00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:19.540\nI get -1.\n\n154\n00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.620\nBut I specified a decimal, right?\n\n155\n00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:27.330\nAnd if I pull this down and then I,\nthey're not doing decimals.\n\n156\n00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.525\nAnd I increase my decimals.\n\n157\n00:07:29.525 --> 00:07:31.540\nNo, it's only whole numbers.\n\n158\n00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.272\nThey will not give you decimal places.\n\n159\n00:07:34.272 --> 00:07:38.080\nSo it won't do 4.,\nif you think about that,\n\n160\n00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:42.630\nif I'm saying 5 through 12,\nthink of all like infinite possibilities.\n\n161\n00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.661\nYou've talked to me about some\ncrazy math like theory stuff, and\n\n162\n00:07:45.661 --> 00:07:48.040\nI'm just like this little\nbrain can't handle it.\n\n163\n00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.550\nBut that's a lot.\n\n164\n00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:54.560\nSo I'm assuming that that's\nwhy this particular function\n\n165\n00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.060\nis not gonna do this both places.\n\n166\n00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.670\nIt will only do whole numbers.\n\n167\n00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:58.700\nDoes that answer your question?\n\n168\n00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:02.882\n&gt;&gt; That does answer my question,\nwhich means if you need decimal places,\n\n169\n00:08:02.882 --> 00:08:05.950\nyou actually have to roll\nback to generating RAND and\n\n170\n00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:10.777\nthen figuring out some formula to scale\nthe respective range of where you want it.\n\n171\n00:08:10.777 --> 00:08:13.100\nIt's actually not too bad.\n\n172\n00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.200\nYou just take your result and\nmultiply whatever your upper bound is, and\n\n173\n00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.200\nyou'll get zero to that upper bound, so.\n\n174\n00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and there's some other nest of\nfunctions where you could just say take\n\n175\n00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:28.030\nthis and kind of then randomly times it\nby different amounts, like 100 or 10.\n\n176\n00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:32.540\nYou could get complicated like that,\nto do some\n\n177\n00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:36.990\nother types of rim generated numbers\nwith decimal places, like you're saying.\n\n178\n00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:40.750\nWe'll keep that for maybe another example.\n\n179\n00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:41.778\nMaybe I'll have you do it too.\n\n180\n00:08:41.778 --> 00:08:44.410\n[LAUGH] So that way we could\njust get some other ways.\n\n181\n00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:48.530\nBut yes, whole numbers only for\nyour RANDBETWEEN.\n\n182\n00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:51.040\nI did use negative numbers.\n\n183\n00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.620\nSo I can go in that stretch.\n\n184\n00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.422\nLook, this one even gave me zero.\n\n185\n00:08:55.422 --> 00:08:59.370\nOkay, so if you needed that range,\nyou're more than welcome to do that.\n\n186\n00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:04.100\nGood questions, good answers,\nbut now what about this?\n\n187\n00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.960\nThis is what can get a little weird.\n\n188\n00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.960\nI come back over here, and actually here.\n\n189\n00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:14.737\nI like you to just kind of mentally\nmake a note of 10, 5, 11, 7.\n\n190\n00:09:14.737 --> 00:09:16.188\nOkay, so you see those?\n\n191\n00:09:16.188 --> 00:09:19.998\nGreat, I'm gonna go back\nover here to sheet one,\n\n192\n00:09:19.998 --> 00:09:24.013\nand I'm gonna type in Justin,\nand then I hit Enter.\n\n193\n00:09:24.013 --> 00:09:25.920\nWhoa, did you see what just happened?\n\n194\n00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.233\nYou knew this was happening too,\ndidn't you?\n\n195\n00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:33.980\n[LAUGH] And if I typed in Vonne and\nhit Enter, changed again.\n\n196\n00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.059\nWhat's going on?\n\n197\n00:09:35.059 --> 00:09:35.837\nWhat?\n\n198\n00:09:35.837 --> 00:09:39.030\nYes, that whole thing that I\ntold you that it's volatile.\n\n199\n00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:43.907\nAny time that you're doing any other\nchanges in your document, I typed in\n\n200\n00:09:43.907 --> 00:09:49.270\nJustin and Vonne, I could come over here,\ndouble-click, and then hit Enter.\n\n201\n00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:52.250\nI didn't even type anything and\nit's still changing.\n\n202\n00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:53.040\nWhat?\n\n203\n00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.440\nThat's just how the function works, okay?\n\n204\n00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.530\nIt's just saying, hey,\n\n205\n00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:01.600\nyou're making changes, I'm randomly\ngenerating this thing, and so I change it.\n\n206\n00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.455\nAnd even, this is not sheet-specific.\n\n207\n00:10:04.455 --> 00:10:08.267\nWasn't it 10, 7, 11, or something-\n&gt;&gt; It was not 5, 6, 12,\n\n208\n00:10:08.267 --> 00:10:09.041\nI can tell you that.\n\n209\n00:10:09.041 --> 00:10:10.590\n&gt;&gt; There you go, exactly.\n\n210\n00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:14.600\nSo it's changing on all of these,\neven over here.\n\n211\n00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.860\nSo this is workbook-wide.\n\n212\n00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.400\nIt is not worksheet specific.\n\n213\n00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.771\nIt will change.\n\n214\n00:10:20.771 --> 00:10:26.830\nNow, you're like, does that mean your\nunit price is changing every time?\n\n215\n00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:31.250\nNo, what I do is I will randomly\ngenerate these numbers, and\n\n216\n00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:34.990\nthen what I need to do is make\nit stop being a function, okay?\n\n217\n00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:40.230\nI don't want it to be RANDBETWEEN,\nI want it to be numbers.\n\n218\n00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:41.740\nThere's a couple ways you could do this.\n\n219\n00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:44.400\nI'm just gonna go across just a few.\n\n220\n00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.080\nSo if you're like, well,\nyou could do it this way too.\n\n221\n00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.410\nYes, that's probably right.\n\n222\n00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:50.616\nI'm just gonna select a couple of them.\n\n223\n00:10:50.616 --> 00:10:55.498\nI'm going to copy it,\ncome over here, and I paste it, but\n\n224\n00:10:55.498 --> 00:10:58.880\nI'm still pasting the function.\n\n225\n00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.730\nYou come down here and\nyou can go into your paste options and\n\n226\n00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:05.220\nI could just paste the values.\n\n227\n00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:11.000\nI do not want you to be a formula, I want\nyou to be numbers and it takes it out.\n\n228\n00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.530\nThis is a function, this is a number.\n\n229\n00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:17.920\nThat's why you always wanna look\nup in your function dialog box or\n\n230\n00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.620\nfunction tool bar, right?\n\n231\n00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.400\nYeah, so that's where we want to look.\n\n232\n00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:26.947\nAnd so that's how I fix my\nrandomly generated numbers,\n\n233\n00:11:26.947 --> 00:11:31.382\nby copying and pasting it to another\nlocation and then use the smart tag.\n\n234\n00:11:31.382 --> 00:11:33.860\nWell you're like, well,\nI don't want to change it.\n\n235\n00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.960\nI need to keep the location.\n\n236\n00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.580\nSo a lot of times what I do is\nI'll take this, I will select it.\n\n237\n00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:42.060\nBy the way, I'm just gonna do this.\n\n238\n00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:46.460\nI am making a copy over here cuz I want to\nshow you a couple other examples, okay?\n\n239\n00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.920\nSo if I have this, here's my selection.\n\n240\n00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.430\nI mean sorry, cancel that.\n\n241\n00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:52.120\nLet's select this.\n\n242\n00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.090\nI will copy it.\n\n243\n00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.180\nIt's just the same place\nI was just at [LAUGH].\n\n244\n00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:59.472\nAnyways, and\nthen I come up here to paste and\n\n245\n00:11:59.472 --> 00:12:05.160\nthen I paste it right back in place\nof where it goes, as just values.\n\n246\n00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.244\nSo now they are just numbers.\n\n247\n00:12:06.244 --> 00:12:11.187\nSo you can select it, copy it,\npaste it, from the home tool bar, and\n\n248\n00:12:11.187 --> 00:12:13.850\nthat's a little easier.\n\n249\n00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:17.080\nThe other one that I wanted to show\nyou that's kinda fun, okay, and\n\n250\n00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.270\nI saw somebody do this, and\nI was like, yeah, I forgot about that.\n\n251\n00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:23.361\nIf I take this selection,\nI'm gonna just zoom out a little bit so\n\n252\n00:12:23.361 --> 00:12:24.858\nyou could see the whole thing.\n\n253\n00:12:24.858 --> 00:12:27.972\nIf I not just drag cuz that's just moving.\n\n254\n00:12:27.972 --> 00:12:32.080\nIf you take your mouse and\nyou right-click, okay?\n\n255\n00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:36.372\nYou hold your right-click down,\nand right-click drag over and\n\n256\n00:12:36.372 --> 00:12:40.740\nthen keeping that held down,\nyou just drag it back over to itself,\n\n257\n00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.874\neven if there is text next to it,\nyou're fine.\n\n258\n00:12:43.874 --> 00:12:45.020\nRight-click drag.\n\n259\n00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:49.668\nIt then gives you this option, cuz that's\nwhat you do anytime in a Windows machine.\n\n260\n00:12:49.668 --> 00:12:53.120\nIf you right-click drag something\nit always gives you this\n\n261\n00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.260\ncontextual menu of hey,\nwhat do you wanna do?\n\n262\n00:12:55.260 --> 00:13:00.870\nAnd then I can just copy here as\nvalues only and then it does it, so.\n\n263\n00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:06.950\nIt's the same functionality\nregardless of how you do it,\n\n264\n00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:11.670\nis that you're pasting just the values and\ntaking out the functions of it.\n\n265\n00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:14.673\nSo that's just a couple ways that you\ncould do it and now they're fixed and\n\n266\n00:13:14.673 --> 00:13:15.506\nthey're numbers.\n\n267\n00:13:15.506 --> 00:13:19.074\nAnd so now, yes, pull the curtain behind,\n\n268\n00:13:19.074 --> 00:13:22.946\nyou see what I do a lot for\nprepping these files.\n\n269\n00:13:22.946 --> 00:13:23.638\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne,\n\n270\n00:13:23.638 --> 00:13:28.550\nI found it interesting that you said this\nis workbook-wide, everything is good.\n\n271\n00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:33.460\nAnd I noticed that even when you fill\ndown the original one still flips.\n\n272\n00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:38.363\nSo fill also causes these to [SOUND]\nalmost like a slot machine, right?\n\n273\n00:13:38.363 --> 00:13:41.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's just randomly like okay,\nhere we go.\n\n274\n00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:44.090\nYou're doing something in the worksheet,\nlike you said.\n\n275\n00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:45.130\nI copied down and\n\n276\n00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:51.030\nthat first one flipped cuz I'm performing\na command in this particular product.\n\n277\n00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:54.850\nSo it will flip over every single time.\n\n278\n00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:57.740\nAnd actually, when you asked that\nquestion, I looked down at my notes and\n\n279\n00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:00.770\nwent, yeah, I have one other\nexample just to show you guys.\n\n280\n00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:03.980\nJust to kind of give you different\nways of thinking of this.\n\n281\n00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:07.220\nCuz you said don't use this for\nsecurity reasons or what have you.\n\n282\n00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.640\nTotally agree on that.\n\n283\n00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:14.650\nBut what if you have, hey, I wanna just\nstart randomly generating invoice numbers.\n\n284\n00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:19.450\nOkay, now this is where I'd probably\nbe like, I would do them sequentially,\n\n285\n00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:21.501\nlike 001, 002, 003.\n\n286\n00:14:21.501 --> 00:14:24.750\nBut that's just how I would do it.\n\n287\n00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:31.717\nFor fun what if I needed to have numbers\nthat always start with like 1001?\n\n288\n00:14:31.717 --> 00:14:34.260\nThat's our department number or something.\n\n289\n00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:39.859\nAnd then the next set of four\nnumbers I want to have random.\n\n290\n00:14:39.859 --> 00:14:45.906\nSo I would start at 1001001.\n\n291\n00:14:45.906 --> 00:14:48.789\nOkay, and then I just realized\nI'm typing these in and\n\n292\n00:14:48.789 --> 00:14:51.493\nI'm not typing in the function,\njust keep going.\n\n293\n00:14:51.493 --> 00:14:57.780\nAnd I want 10019999, okay?\n\n294\n00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:00.218\nThose are the numbers that\nI want to go through.\n\n295\n00:15:00.218 --> 00:15:05.884\nSo what I can say is writing\nthe formula out, RANDBETWEEN.\n\n296\n00:15:05.884 --> 00:15:08.307\nAnd then I take this number, I mean,\n\n297\n00:15:08.307 --> 00:15:11.598\nI can actually use the cell\nreference if I want to.\n\n298\n00:15:11.598 --> 00:15:13.139\nAnd then say this number and\n\n299\n00:15:13.139 --> 00:15:18.097\nthen say, alright that's sounds good, and\nnow all of these numbers are going to,\n\n300\n00:15:18.097 --> 00:15:21.651\nI just realized that that's\ngoing to use relative reference.\n\n301\n00:15:21.651 --> 00:15:23.791\nOkay, that's fine, you know what,\nwe'll just do this.\n\n302\n00:15:23.791 --> 00:15:26.240\nWe'll go head and absolute reference this.\n\n303\n00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.088\nThis is what I do when\nI go off the cuff and\n\n304\n00:15:28.088 --> 00:15:30.400\nI don't go by what I planned\nto do to begin with.\n\n305\n00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.160\nThat's all right, I can fix it.\n\n306\n00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:38.570\nSo now you can see that, there you go,\nso everything starts with 101 and\n\n307\n00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:42.530\nthen randomly picks between these numbers.\n\n308\n00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:46.790\nSo you can use that if you need to have\nfixed numbers in a certain place, and\n\n309\n00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:48.340\nthen randomly generate the rest.\n\n310\n00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.550\nSame ideas, you would have to go ahead and\n\n311\n00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:56.160\ndo the right-click, drag, back over,\nand then copy it as values only.\n\n312\n00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:00.490\nAnd then if I wanted to put a dash in\nbetween them, because I need to have them\n\n313\n00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:06.530\nas 1001-6961,\nthen that's just number formatting.\n\n314\n00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:10.850\nI could go into a custom number format and\n\n315\n00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:17.290\nthen say that I would need 000\ncuz I want them to accept zeros.\n\n316\n00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:21.005\nThen open the parenthesis,\nthat's not a parenthesis, that's a quote.\n\n317\n00:16:21.005 --> 00:16:25.894\nAnd then typing the dash,\nclose the quote, Justin over there like,\n\n318\n00:16:25.894 --> 00:16:28.795\ndo you know what you're talking about?\n\n319\n00:16:28.795 --> 00:16:30.505\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] It varies.\n\n320\n00:16:30.505 --> 00:16:34.454\nSo that way I'm saying take the first\nfour numbers including zeros,\n\n321\n00:16:34.454 --> 00:16:38.538\nput in a hyphen or a dash, that's why\nI have the quotes around my text and\n\n322\n00:16:38.538 --> 00:16:40.590\nthen the last four numbers.\n\n323\n00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:44.170\nAnd then if I click OK,\nthen I get something like that.\n\n324\n00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:47.670\nSo that way,\nI can have all these different ways.\n\n325\n00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:49.620\nAgain, just another example.\n\n326\n00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:52.880\nJust kinda get you thinking of like\nhow you might want to use this\n\n327\n00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:57.620\nin your everyday life cuz maybe you don't\nhave to prep exercise files like me.\n\n328\n00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:00.230\nYou need to generate invoice numbers.\n\n329\n00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:01.250\nYou can do that.\n\n330\n00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:05.750\n&gt;&gt; Well Vonne, I can tell you that every\ntime I'm here I'm like this is how I would\n\n331\n00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:08.440\ndo, right when you explain something,\nyou're like this is what we're gonna do.\n\n332\n00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.500\nAnd I'm like, what would I do?\n\n333\n00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:13.010\nAnd I always make it way more\ncomplicated than it needs to be.\n\n334\n00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:15.990\nI was like, yeah,\nwell you can have this and\n\n335\n00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:18.840\nyou can concatenate these two numbers\ntogether after you make them a string.\n\n336\n00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:20.810\nAnd you're like,\njust customer number format.\n\n337\n00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:22.370\nI was like, yeah, you can do that.\n\n338\n00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:25.824\nSo definitely try to keep\nthings simple and RAND and\n\n339\n00:17:25.824 --> 00:17:28.400\nRANDBETWEEN, maybe you\ndon't use them every day,\n\n340\n00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.100\nbut when you do need them they\nwill definitely be there for you.\n\n341\n00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.570\nAnd Vonne, before we get out\nof here is there any final\n\n342\n00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:35.060\nparting words of wisdom for us?\n\n343\n00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.450\n&gt;&gt; Well, when you just said that,\nI would do this and I would do that,\n\n344\n00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:39.150\nand I would concatenate it.\n\n345\n00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:42.890\nI started going down that path too, and\nI'm like wait no custom number format.\n\n346\n00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:47.762\nSo I just wanted to throw in there that\nyou can get the same end result so\n\n347\n00:17:47.762 --> 00:17:49.822\nmany different ways.\n\n348\n00:17:49.822 --> 00:17:53.370\nAnd so someone's like I would've done it\nthat way, I would've done it this way.\n\n349\n00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:56.680\nI know, there's a lot of\ndifferent things that you can do.\n\n350\n00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:00.180\nSo I don't want you to think that what\nI'm showing you is just the only way to\n\n351\n00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:00.730\ndo things.\n\n352\n00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.060\nJust keep it open, okay.\n\n353\n00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:08.714\nAnd keep thinking hey,\nI did 15 steps to make this happen, but\n\n354\n00:18:08.714 --> 00:18:11.080\nI could've done it with two.\n\n355\n00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.530\nOkay.\nWell at least I know it's possible.\n\n356\n00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:13.570\nIt's all a learning experience,\n\n357\n00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:17.125\nso just throwing those two cents in\nbecause I do the same thing all the time.\n\n358\n00:18:17.125 --> 00:18:18.830\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm glad to know that I'm not\n\n359\n00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:21.920\nthe only one who makes things way more\ncomplicated than they need to be.\n\n360\n00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.735\nWell, not to complicate your life,\n\n361\n00:18:23.735 --> 00:18:26.320\nyou should definitely check\nout more OfficeProTV.\n\n362\n00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.540\nBut for this episode,\nwe're gonna go ahead and get outta here.\n\n363\n00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.350\nSo signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n364\n00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:32.000\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n365\n00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.149\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n366\n00:18:34.149 -->

OfficePROTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:16.980\nI'm you host Justin Dennison.\n\n4\n00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:17.980\nAnd let me tell you what,\n\n5\n00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.710\nit's time to level up as we continue\non with our Excel functions adventure.\n\n6\n00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.815\nAn in particular what we're gonna be\nlooking at today, and now, and know,\n\n7\n00:00:25.815 --> 00:00:28.677\nI'm not talking about the time\nthat we're recording, but Instead,\n\n8\n00:00:28.677 --> 00:00:29.665\nsome Excel functions.\n\n9\n00:00:29.665 --> 00:00:32.425\nAnd here to help us along in that\nvery endeavor is Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n10\n00:00:32.425 --> 00:00:33.425\nHow you doing today, Vonne?\n\n11\n00:00:33.425 --> 00:00:36.165\n&gt;&gt; Today, I'm doing very good right now.\n\n12\n00:00:36.165 --> 00:00:37.620\n&gt;&gt; I see what you did there.\n\n13\n00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.975\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's Excel functions in\n\n14\n00:00:38.975 --> 00:00:39.760\neveryday language.\n\n15\n00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.435\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, yes, and\n\n16\n00:00:41.435 --> 00:00:47.025\nthese are probably the most basic\nof our date functions, okay?\n\n17\n00:00:47.025 --> 00:00:48.965\nThere's lots of things that you\ncan do with time and dates and\n\n18\n00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:53.130\nit's really important because I think\na lot of people will go ahead and\n\n19\n00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.060\nstore dates in their Excel spreadsheets.\n\n20\n00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.096\nBecause they're logging things in for\ntheir business and\n\n21\n00:01:00.096 --> 00:01:03.470\na lot of things do revolve around time and\ndates so\n\n22\n00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.351\nwe're going to jump into the first\nones which is the today and the now.\n\n23\n00:01:08.351 --> 00:01:12.641\nNow I can show you this\nprobably in 30 seconds and be,\n\n24\n00:01:12.641 --> 00:01:15.170\nsee that's what it does, bye.\n\n25\n00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.580\nBut, I wanna give you a back story,\ngive you a little introduction.\n\n26\n00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.190\nWe are going to keep this very basic and\nvery simple.\n\n27\n00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.570\nThis is something that today and\n\n28\n00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.430\nnow that you will most likely\nbuild upon in nested functions and\n\n29\n00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.655\ncombine it in with other things to be\nable to do date and time calculations.\n\n30\n00:01:34.655 --> 00:01:39.155\nAll right but we're gonna keep it small,\nkeep it a nice level playing field.\n\n31\n00:01:39.155 --> 00:01:43.650\nAnd throw a little interesting tidbit\nthere in about some history and\n\n32\n00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.930\nsome preferences that could get\nyou a little spun around a bit.\n\n33\n00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:49.850\nWait, what day is it?\n\n34\n00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.110\nI mean I do that all the time, wait, what?\n\n35\n00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.350\nIs today Friday?\n\n36\n00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.290\nWait, it's only Thursday?\n\n37\n00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.210\nMan, so,\nwe'll throw that out there for you.\n\n38\n00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.470\nSo, we're going to get started.\n\n39\n00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.110\nWhy don't we go ahead and\njump on down and talk about dates.\n\n40\n00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.630\nWe're gonna do a quick review Justin.\n\n41\n00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.200\nI have, that's actually my MAC so\nwhy don't we go ahead and\n\n42\n00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.980\nnot click that one and come down here,\nto, there we go a new workbook.\n\n43\n00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.010\nThat's what I was trying to get at.\n\n44\n00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.275\nSo, Justin?\n\n45\n00:02:19.275 --> 00:02:24.806\nGive me a date.\n\n46\n00:02:24.806 --> 00:02:25.717\n&gt;&gt; 2-1-2009.\n\n47\n00:02:25.717 --> 00:02:27.760\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, all right.\n\n48\n00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.590\nThat's why I'm just typing in a date.\n\n49\n00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.330\nNow, from other episodes in our\nessential series, when I went ahead and\n\n50\n00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.570\ntyped in a date it automatically\nformatted it, as a date.\n\n51\n00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:44.454\nBecause Excel will do that because a title\nin its specific pattern that I understood,\n\n52\n00:02:44.454 --> 00:02:49.056\nif I did 2--1--09 is not\ngonna see that as a date.\n\n53\n00:02:49.056 --> 00:02:53.670\nOkay the automatic date formatting\nis something that does happen with\n\n54\n00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.554\nExcel when you're typing.\n\n55\n00:02:55.554 --> 00:02:58.831\nCuz in a regular notebook,\nWorkbook not notebook,\n\n56\n00:02:58.831 --> 00:03:02.230\nthat open up the notes\nkind of threw me off.\n\n57\n00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.100\nRight here,\nit's in a general number format.\n\n58\n00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.660\nSo that's what we've got.\n\n59\n00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.880\nWhen I typed in a date it automatically\nflipped it into a date format.\n\n60\n00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.020\nSo formatting cells is something\nthat we've talked about.\n\n61\n00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.530\nIf I typed in 5 and I wanted that to be\ndisplayed as dollars, I just click on it,\n\n62\n00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.550\nand then it's $5.\n\n63\n00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.360\nThe same as if I typed in something and\nI wanted to format it as a date or\n\n64\n00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.550\nmaybe this particular date,\nI wanna change this into a long date, and\n\n65\n00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.840\nactually show the day and\nthe month spelled out.\n\n66\n00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.460\nAnd so different ways that we\ncan look at things, but dates.\n\n67\n00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.670\nDoes the computer really\nknow what day it is, Justin.\n\n68\n00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.910\nWhat is a date in computer language?\n\n69\n00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.750\n&gt;&gt; Well, actually, it's funny because\nwe don't think of dates this way.\n\n70\n00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.370\nBut dates are always based on some\npreviously established reference.\n\n71\n00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.080\nAnd then we pick a unit to\ncount from that, right?\n\n72\n00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.700\nSo if we're talking about years,\n\n73\n00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.450\nwell how do we differentiate\nlast year to this year?\n\n74\n00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.790\nWell, that's 365 and a quarter.\n\n75\n00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:01.580\nBut we do 365.\n\n76\n00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.070\nDays get a little weird.\n\n77\n00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.280\nBut right, what is 2010?\n\n78\n00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.400\nWhether there is some zero date,\nand then we went one, two,\n\n79\n00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.970\nthree, four, five, six, seven, eight,\nnine, ten, all the way through and\n\n80\n00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.180\nit's just a reference to a previously\nestablished reference point.\n\n81\n00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit's a number in all actuality but\n\n82\n00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.650\nthat's a great way of explaining it that\nthere is some type of, like you said,\n\n83\n00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.710\na reference table that\nthe computer is understanding.\n\n84\n00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.690\nAll right this is today's date but\nit thinks it's a number.\n\n85\n00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.270\nYes, it is connected to\nyour computer clock and\n\n86\n00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.490\neverything like that once\nwe get into our functions.\n\n87\n00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.870\nBut that's what it understands as dates.\n\n88\n00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.460\nSo this is really a number.\n\n89\n00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:51.050\nIf I take this and just change it back\ninto a general format, it's a 39,845.\n\n90\n00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.730\nThat's what February 1,\n2009 is in this computer.\n\n91\n00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.290\nThat's how all computers,\nthat's what they think of, in numbers.\n\n92\n00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.410\nWell if it's a number then what can we do?\n\n93\n00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.700\nWe can perform calculations on it, okay.\n\n94\n00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.740\nPerfect, now what two minus,\n&gt;&gt; One, [LAUGH].\n\n95\n00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.802\nI almost said five and I'm, well,\nlet's not go negative, okay?\n\n96\n00:05:11.802 --> 00:05:13.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I just went into a whole other world\n\n97\n00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.990\nthat we're not gonna go in when\nwe're talking about dates, okay?\n\n98\n00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.470\nSo just remember that dates are numbers.\n\n99\n00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.830\nAnd when we talk about days,\nwe also have time, right?\n\n100\n00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:30.622\nSo if I typed in, let's go with 9,\nOops, that's the wrong key.\n\n101\n00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:33.530\n[LAUGH] 9 space AM.\n\n102\n00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.080\nIt actually puts it into\na custom number format.\n\n103\n00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.960\nBut it understands this as time.\n\n104\n00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.860\nNow it's not tied to a specific day,\njust so you know.\n\n105\n00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.800\nIt's not like a date and a time.\n\n106\n00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.310\nBut if I took this and\nconverted it into general.\n\n107\n00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.160\nIt's a decimal.\n\n108\n00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.790\nOkay, what about like 9:00 PM?\n\n109\n00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.420\nWhat do you think that is?\n\n110\n00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.660\nOkay, that's gonna be a decimal as well.\n\n111\n00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.910\nThis kinda looks like something, right?\n\n112\n00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:08.650\nOkay, so\non one full day it's gonna be one.\n\n113\n00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:14.970\nAnd so when you have time, it's going\nto be a decimal or a fraction of that.\n\n114\n00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:15.870\nAnd 375, 875.\n\n115\n00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.920\nIf I typed in 11 PM, okay?\n\n116\n00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:20.980\nAnd then went to here.\n\n117\n00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.920\nAll right, well,\nthen that's almost two one.\n\n118\n00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.550\nSo that's what it's talking about when\nyou're going to be talking about time.\n\n119\n00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:30.900\nIt's in a decimal.\n\n120\n00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.480\nDates are in whole numbers.\n\n121\n00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.860\nTimes are in fractions or decimals.\n\n122\n00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:41.060\nSo if I typed in 2-1-09 and\n\n123\n00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:48.780\nthen I typed in the time as well,\nit's going to give me that in fractions.\n\n124\n00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.200\nIt's going to give me\na decimal point with that.\n\n125\n00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.880\nSo it would take this 39,845 point and\n\n126\n00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.430\nwhatever the time that\nis associated with that.\n\n127\n00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:58.890\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n128\n00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:03.490\nJust kind of a quick review about\nhow dates work in Excel and\n\n129\n00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:08.470\nwhat it means, and whole numbers,\ndecimals, time, and date.\n\n130\n00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:14.420\nCool, because you have a date\nfunction called today.\n\n131\n00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.590\nThe today function doesn't\n\n132\n00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:22.230\nreally have any arguments because a lot\nof times it's when we do text format.\n\n133\n00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.450\nIf I say I want to upper something,\n\n134\n00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:26.400\nyou have to give it a cell\nreference like that.\n\n135\n00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.590\nIn between the parentheses,\nyou have your arguments.\n\n136\n00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:32.400\nIn this function, there are no arguments.\n\n137\n00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.390\nLet's just go ahead and\n\n138\n00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:37.620\ngo to the insert function dialog\nbox to see what this looks like.\n\n139\n00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.140\nI'm just going to go ahead and\ntype into Today and then click Go so\n\n140\n00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.040\nit can find it for me.\n\n141\n00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.800\nAnd that's the one I want.\n\n142\n00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:48.620\nAnd it says right here, returns\nthe current date formatted as a date.\n\n143\n00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.223\nIt takes no arguments.\n\n144\n00:07:50.223 --> 00:07:53.786\nThis is volatile, that's so scary.\n\n145\n00:07:53.786 --> 00:07:56.742\nBut it really just means\nit's always going to change.\n\n146\n00:07:56.742 --> 00:07:58.635\nAnd that's all you do, you click OK.\n\n147\n00:07:58.635 --> 00:08:02.957\nAnd it's going to give today's date, at\nthe time of his recording, it is April 27,\n\n148\n00:08:02.957 --> 00:08:03.568\n2018.\n\n149\n00:08:03.568 --> 00:08:08.890\nPerfect, that's it.\n\n150\n00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:10.650\nThat's really all the function does.\n\n151\n00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:14.180\nIt is going to return the date\naccording to your system clock.\n\n152\n00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.269\nI will say in this virtual machine,\nthere's some weird thing,\n\n153\n00:08:17.269 --> 00:08:18.650\nit doesn't reset the time.\n\n154\n00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:22.764\nI have to actually go into the time and\ndate, and turn off automatic and\n\n155\n00:08:22.764 --> 00:08:24.680\nturn it back on to reset itself.\n\n156\n00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:29.830\nThat's a virtual machine thing, has\nnothing to do with my computer by itself.\n\n157\n00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:35.070\n&gt;&gt; So does that mean that if I\nalter the clock on my computer and\n\n158\n00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:39.460\nI run today,\ndo I get a different value within Excel?\n\n159\n00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.190\n&gt;&gt; You wanna try it?\n\n160\n00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:43.160\n&gt;&gt; Sure, let's try it.\n\n161\n00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.110\n&gt;&gt; I'm, I wanna say yes, but\nwhy don't we try it, it's behind my head.\n\n162\n00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:48.770\nSo why don't we go ahead and\nlook at the clock and\n\n163\n00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:51.530\nI'm going to adjust the Date and Time.\n\n164\n00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:56.740\nI wanna say yes, but if I went ahead and\nchanged this to another time zone.\n\n165\n00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.330\nRight, because that would change the time.\n\n166\n00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:00.340\nOr, could we-\n&gt;&gt; I was thinking turning\n\n167\n00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:01.316\nthe automatic off.\n\n168\n00:09:01.316 --> 00:09:03.350\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And then manually set it.\n\n169\n00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.930\n&gt;&gt; Right here, change?\n\n170\n00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:04.730\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n171\n00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:09.110\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so we're going to\nchange it to the the 30th, and\n\n172\n00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:14.550\nwe'll change it and then,\nwe'll close this and let's just try.\n\n173\n00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:22.160\nI wonder if there's a refresh,\nI know you can refresh your formula.\n\n174\n00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.859\n&gt;&gt; I wonder, can you just hit Enter?\n\n175\n00:09:26.313 --> 00:09:28.050\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n176\n00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:32.890\nBecause I had to do something to\ninitiate it creating a change.\n\n177\n00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:35.720\nAnd so, once it went ahead and\ndid that change, yes,\n\n178\n00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.390\nit is connected to that clock, so Yes.\n\n179\n00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:41.960\nIt is true, I though that was the answer\nbut it is always good to check right?\n\n180\n00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.390\nAnd I know you, you are always\ntrying to break things, so [LAUGH]-\n\n181\n00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:46.060\n&gt;&gt; So all I can think about is,\n\n182\n00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:49.390\nI can mess with the system clock and\ntotally mess the cell system up.\n\n183\n00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:51.070\n&gt;&gt; Pretty much, yeah.\n\n184\n00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:54.868\n&gt;&gt; So I'm thinking of ways to break it but\nthis also brings up an interesting point.\n\n185\n00:09:54.868 --> 00:09:59.430\nIf you're utilizing this for\nmaybe parts of reporting or something,\n\n186\n00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:00.275\nyou need to be careful.\n\n187\n00:10:00.275 --> 00:10:03.690\nCuz if your system clock\nis by chance wrong,\n\n188\n00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:07.300\nthen the use of this is going\nto be a little bit different, so\n\n189\n00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:12.290\nyou just have to keep that in mind and\nI also noticed this does something else.\n\n190\n00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:17.195\nAny time parts of the worksheet\nchange then it re-does it, right?\n\n191\n00:10:17.195 --> 00:10:19.590\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's a good point.\n\n192\n00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:23.150\nKeep that thought, because I'm gonna\nshow that a little bit more but\n\n193\n00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:24.900\nthat is huge point.\n\n194\n00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:28.170\nGreat points all together of,\nhey make sure your computer clock and\n\n195\n00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:30.850\nyour system clock is correct.\n\n196\n00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:33.810\nBecause if you use this, and we're gonna\nuse this in other calculations and\n\n197\n00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:40.020\nformulas, yeah, and if your job is to\nreport when people get paid, you know.\n\n198\n00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:46.050\nThat might be a little scary if you\nmess with people's time and money.\n\n199\n00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:51.130\nSo, good good points, cool, and\nyes it's ball time it keeps changing.\n\n200\n00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:55.910\nKeep that in mind,\nlet's do the now function.\n\n201\n00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:59.070\nCuz it's very similar, and\nit's the same thing, no argument.\n\n202\n00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:00.100\nSo I'm gonna type this out.\n\n203\n00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.040\nI'm just gonna say = now.\n\n204\n00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.431\nI'll go ahead and do the open and\nclosed parentheses.\n\n205\n00:11:04.431 --> 00:11:05.736\nI'm gonna hit Enter.\n\n206\n00:11:05.736 --> 00:11:07.280\nWell what's the difference there?\n\n207\n00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:13.530\nThis is today, this is now, the biggest\ndifference, it reports the time as well.\n\n208\n00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:21.440\nThe today does not report time, the now\nwill report time, the date and the time.\n\n209\n00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.690\nSo that's the biggest differences\nbetween these two functions.\n\n210\n00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:29.170\nI'm just gonna move this over here,\njust to kinda move it away for a second.\n\n211\n00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:32.350\nAnd let's just zoom in just so\nyou could see that a little bit more.\n\n212\n00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:35.440\nOkay, cool, so that's what we've got.\n\n213\n00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:40.260\nNow if I went ahead and changed these\nboth to numbers, just to show you.\n\n214\n00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:44.470\nThere is the one that has the decimal,\nand the one that doesn't have a decimal.\n\n215\n00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:48.540\nBecause of the time versus just the date,\nthe whole number and\n\n216\n00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:52.150\nthe decimals,\nI'm gonna undo that for a second.\n\n217\n00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:56.270\nYou can take your now function and\n\n218\n00:11:56.270 --> 00:12:02.130\nyou could record this, or you could format\nit as a short date and take the time out.\n\n219\n00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:04.260\nBut just know that in the formula or\n\n220\n00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:08.042\nfunction itself,\nit is going to calculate your time.\n\n221\n00:12:08.042 --> 00:12:12.590\nAll right, so keep that in mind,\nwhen you're doing it here.\n\n222\n00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:17.076\nIf I took this today and tried to format\nit, we'll do a custom, not custom,\n\n223\n00:12:17.076 --> 00:12:20.243\nwe'll just go into more of\nthe options with the date.\n\n224\n00:12:20.243 --> 00:12:24.982\nAnd say, I would like you to report the\nday and the time, you see that's, wait,\n\n225\n00:12:24.982 --> 00:12:29.410\nbut I thought this one,\nI thought it's 9:30 right, why is this 12?\n\n226\n00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:34.420\nIt's always gonna report 12,\nbecause it's not grabbing,\n\n227\n00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.240\nif you wanna say, the time of it.\n\n228\n00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.390\nSo it's not like you can just format it,\nand\n\n229\n00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:41.400\nit's automatically gonna\nstart reporting the time,\n\n230\n00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:46.830\nno you would have to change the function\nitself for it to include the time.\n\n231\n00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:51.390\nSmall nuances, but good to understand the\ndifferences between these two functions.\n\n232\n00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:53.920\n&gt;&gt; And effectively, you can think of it\nas if you've formatted it as a number.\n\n233\n00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.840\nIf it's a whole number without a decimal,\nit's always gonna be reporting 12,\n\n234\n00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.450\nbecause it's always gonna try to\nsay well let me add some decimals.\n\n235\n00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:01.920\nWell what are the decimals,\nall I can do is add zero,\n\n236\n00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:05.510\nI can't randomly grab just\na random number and report those.\n\n237\n00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:09.771\nThat would be very non-deterministic\nwhich is super annoying.\n\n238\n00:13:09.771 --> 00:13:11.443\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; When it comes to function.\n\n239\n00:13:11.443 --> 00:13:12.581\n&gt;&gt; I know you love that.\n\n240\n00:13:12.581 --> 00:13:17.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Like you love it but you also are like\n\n241\n00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:23.131\nthis is not, it breaks all of my rules\nof determining exactly what's happening.\n\n242\n00:13:23.131 --> 00:13:27.010\n[LAUGH] Good point, so\nyou said about the volatile thing.\n\n243\n00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:30.700\nSo I wanna open up a file,\ndo I have it up?\n\n244\n00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:34.680\nI was just doing this yesterday,\nso test, so let's open this up.\n\n245\n00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:37.420\nJust the date function, right?\n\n246\n00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:42.842\nThis one is date, this is custom,\nbut it is the now.\n\n247\n00:13:42.842 --> 00:13:44.665\nAll right, sorry,\nI was looking the the wrong place.\n\n248\n00:13:44.665 --> 00:13:47.460\n[LAUGH] I need to look at the formula bar,\nit's not doing anything.\n\n249\n00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:52.740\nClicking around an Excel worksheet,\ndoesn't record any actual\n\n250\n00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:57.760\ninput or computation, so\nwe haven't done anything.\n\n251\n00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:02.750\nI'm trying to talk enough to get maybe\na minute or so, past Because this is\n\n252\n00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:06.930\nsomething that people will say,\nwell I didn't do anything in the file.\n\n253\n00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:10.300\nAll I did was open it and close it,\nnormally, if you have done something and\n\n254\n00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:15.520\nhaven't saved your changes, it will say\nhey do you want to save your changes?\n\n255\n00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:19.520\nWell, if I try to close this, that's what\nI was looking for, so, look it that.\n\n256\n00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.550\nIt's like,\ndo you want to save your changes?\n\n257\n00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:23.010\nI didn't do anything.\n\n258\n00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:29.930\nWell you didn't do anything, but\nthe functions are always computing.\n\n259\n00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:32.550\nOr they're actually\nperforming calculations,\n\n260\n00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:35.940\njust doing processes in the background.\n\n261\n00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:38.270\nBecause you're saying,\nI want you to report the date,\n\n262\n00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:42.500\nI want you to report the time today and\nnow, so it is doing something.\n\n263\n00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:47.650\nSo just be aware, that if you have these\ntwo functions and you don't actually\n\n264\n00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:52.370\ndo anything, it' still gonna ask you, do\nyou wanna save or do you not wanna save.\n\n265\n00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:55.700\nEven if you say, don't,\nit's not gonna put the time backwards, no,\n\n266\n00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:56.970\nit will just happen next time.\n\n267\n00:14:56.970 --> 00:15:00.310\nSo just letting you know that,\nthat is something to be aware of and\n\n268\n00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:05.030\nyou had mentioned you had to do\nsomething for it to change it.\n\n269\n00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:09.920\nCome back around, that's where, yeah, you\nsometimes don't have to do anything and\n\n270\n00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.310\nit's still doing it.\n\n271\n00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:13.190\nAll right, so like I said,\n\n272\n00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:16.320\nonce you understand that these\nare numbers what can I do?\n\n273\n00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:21.570\nI can do some basic calculations with\nthem, so I have a quick little example.\n\n274\n00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:25.700\nAnd we have something like, hey,\nI have a, whoops come on over here.\n\n275\n00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:30.330\nLet's move on over, I have project dates.\n\n276\n00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:35.160\nI have some things that we have to get\ndone, and there are due dates on that.\n\n277\n00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.930\nWell, I want to know how\nmany days left do we have\n\n278\n00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:39.590\non that particular project, you know?\n\n279\n00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:43.440\nAnd I want to count down, I don't want\nto have to change this every single day.\n\n280\n00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:47.726\nSo, how about we take, well when's\nthe project due, and just take and\n\n281\n00:15:47.726 --> 00:15:50.870\nminus what today is, and\nit should give us a result,\n\n282\n00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:54.451\nbecause these are all numbers\nI'm gonna back out anyways.\n\n283\n00:15:54.451 --> 00:15:55.603\nOkay, well that sounds great.\n\n284\n00:15:55.603 --> 00:15:59.429\nSo this is a cell that has\na today Function it, okay, so\n\n285\n00:15:59.429 --> 00:16:01.675\nI've kinda put it off to a side,\n\n286\n00:16:01.675 --> 00:16:07.460\nbecause I'm gonna use that as a cell\nreference to perform my calculation.\n\n287\n00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:12.111\nSo we're gonna say, all right, we'll take\nthis equals this cell minus this cell,\n\n288\n00:16:12.111 --> 00:16:13.560\nthat's all I need to do.\n\n289\n00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:17.918\nWhen I hit Enter, we have 96 days left to\ngo ahead and complete that project, cool.\n\n290\n00:16:17.918 --> 00:16:20.800\nWell, now I wanna do it for\nthe rest of them.\n\n291\n00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.345\nYou do have to absolute reference\nthis one, because I want to\n\n292\n00:16:24.345 --> 00:16:28.532\nmake sure we go down here, but\ndon't change the cell reference there.\n\n293\n00:16:28.532 --> 00:16:31.531\nSo, if I edit this particular function,\n\n294\n00:16:31.531 --> 00:16:37.360\nwe'll just take an absolute reference,\nthe date cell with that function in it,\n\n295\n00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:42.210\nand then we can double click and\nmove this along down the road.\n\n296\n00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.500\nOkay, perfect, sounds great, right?\n\n297\n00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.600\nLike that, one thing to be careful of.\n\n298\n00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.850\nIf I had this, I'm gonna come\ncome over here to the cell and\n\n299\n00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:53.920\nchange this to NOW, and hit Enter.\n\n300\n00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.116\nNow we have them in decimals,\nand it's like, okay,\n\n301\n00:16:56.116 --> 00:16:57.410\nwell, you know what you could do?\n\n302\n00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:59.350\nYou could just take this, and\n\n303\n00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:03.210\nyou could format this, you could just say,\noops, that's the other button.\n\n304\n00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:05.984\nI wanna, and\nthen look at where we're at, but\n\n305\n00:17:05.984 --> 00:17:10.200\nnow the whole numbers,\nthey're getting rounded up, aren't they?\n\n306\n00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.538\nBecause of the clock, the 24 hour clock,\n\n307\n00:17:13.538 --> 00:17:18.605\nonce it gets past noon,\nit's gonna go ahead and change your date.\n\n308\n00:17:18.605 --> 00:17:22.447\nSo, just something to think about,\ncuz a lot of people think, the TODAY and\n\n309\n00:17:22.447 --> 00:17:24.040\nthe NOW are the exact same thing.\n\n310\n00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:28.380\nNot always, okay, so just beware.\n\n311\n00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.350\nI would just stick with the TODAY.\n\n312\n00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:36.980\nIf I'm using days, and I do not need\nany decimals or time, use that, okay?\n\n313\n00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:38.810\nSo, that's something that you could do.\n\n314\n00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:43.610\nA very basic calculation\nwith the TODAY and NOW.\n\n315\n00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:46.640\nThe other example that I have down here\nis that you actually don't even have to\n\n316\n00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.100\nneed to.\n\n317\n00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.940\nDon't actually have to need to,\n[LAUGH] what?\n\n318\n00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:57.000\nYou don't have to put the TODAY in\na separate cell as a reference,\n\n319\n00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.240\nyou could actually type it\nright into your formula.\n\n320\n00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:05.850\nI could say, = this cell- the TODAY.\n\n321\n00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:09.030\nNow, I was like, wait, but that's wrong.\n\n322\n00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:11.350\nThat's just because it's\nformatted as a date.\n\n323\n00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:15.320\nIf I take this and then put this back\nto a Number, it's the same thing.\n\n324\n00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:21.910\nSo you can nest it, if you wanna say,\nright into your calculations.\n\n325\n00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:25.250\nIn this sense, if I just copy down,\nbecause now it's not copying a cell\n\n326\n00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:26.790\nreference, I don't have\nto absolute reference it.\n\n327\n00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:30.539\nI can just go ahead and say today\nis the day, and we copy it on down.\n\n328\n00:18:30.539 --> 00:18:36.200\nSo you could type it directly into any\ntype of calculations, if you so desire.\n\n329\n00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:41.555\nSo, just again, very basic examples\nof how to calculate with dates.\n\n330\n00:18:41.555 --> 00:18:46.349\nWe'll have lots more episodes on\ndoing all sorts of date calculations,\n\n331\n00:18:46.349 --> 00:18:50.053\nbut that was the one that I\nwanted to just show, for now.\n\n332\n00:18:50.053 --> 00:18:51.800\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\nthank you so much Vonne.\n\n333\n00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:55.094\nAnd I will tell you, there's\na little bit of me that always wants\n\n334\n00:18:55.094 --> 00:18:57.655\nto put things as separate cell references.\n\n335\n00:18:57.655 --> 00:19:01.725\nSo I can make sure if things are going\nwonky with these, I'm like okay,\n\n336\n00:19:01.725 --> 00:19:04.595\nwell let me look at this individual,\nso I don't have to change all those.\n\n337\n00:19:04.595 --> 00:19:08.597\nBut that's just me, and\nsometimes you have different needs, right?\n\n338\n00:19:08.597 --> 00:19:09.897\nNow, before we get out of here, Vonne,\n\n339\n00:19:09.897 --> 00:19:15.007\nare there any final words of wisdom for\nthese particular functions?\n\n340\n00:19:15.007 --> 00:19:18.247\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I set myself up in the beginning,\nI said I have this little tidbit for\n\n341\n00:19:18.247 --> 00:19:22.710\nyou, and this is the tidbit.\n\n342\n00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:25.950\nOkay, Justin, as you take a sip of coffee,\n\n343\n00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:31.482\n[LAUGH] do you know anything between\nthe 1900 and 1904 date system?\n\n344\n00:19:31.482 --> 00:19:35.864\n&gt;&gt; Well, there were four years\nbetween those [LAUGH] two dates.\n\n345\n00:19:35.864 --> 00:19:38.764\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was actually\ncurious if you knew this, and\n\n346\n00:19:38.764 --> 00:19:44.430\nit's just kind of one of those, that's\nwhat that particular preference means.\n\n347\n00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:46.615\nLet me tell you what it is,\nwhy don't we come back down into here?\n\n348\n00:19:46.615 --> 00:19:51.063\nOkay, so, I'm going to pull up,\nthere is things that I've,\n\n349\n00:19:51.063 --> 00:19:56.090\nthroughout history in talking about, well,\n\n350\n00:19:56.090 --> 00:20:00.854\nExcel for Mac and Excel for PC,\nthey don't do the same things.\n\n351\n00:20:00.854 --> 00:20:04.016\nWell, yeah, of course there\nhas always been differences,\n\n352\n00:20:04.016 --> 00:20:07.187\nbut in how they do dates,\nthere's some major differences.\n\n353\n00:20:07.187 --> 00:20:10.490\nNow, this is old information,\njust so you know.\n\n354\n00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:14.640\nToday, if you're using Excel 2016 for\nMac and Excel 2016 for PC,\n\n355\n00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.160\nyou probably won't encounter this.\n\n356\n00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:21.656\nBut it is something to just be aware of,\njust in case your dates are like,\n\n357\n00:20:21.656 --> 00:20:23.300\nthat's way off.\n\n358\n00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:29.006\nThose are not our dates,\nbecause there's a preference in this,\n\n359\n00:20:29.006 --> 00:20:32.945\nand back in the day,\nin the old Excel for Mac,\n\n360\n00:20:32.945 --> 00:20:39.195\nthey used the date system that\nstarted with 1904 and not 1900.\n\n361\n00:20:39.195 --> 00:20:43.860\nBecause, just really quickly for,\nif I type in, actually I have it, okay?\n\n362\n00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.026\nSo let's go ahead and\ncome over here, okay?\n\n363\n00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:51.770\nSo if I take these numbers, right, just\nstraight numbers, and I went ahead and\n\n364\n00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:57.000\nsaid what are these in dates, and\nI changed this to a short date.\n\n365\n00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.570\nIt says it's January 1st, 1900, January\n2nd, because that's just how it counts.\n\n366\n00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:06.930\nYou talked about that reference, there is\na 0, and there is a 1, so January 1st.\n\n367\n00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:12.660\nYou can't do dates before 1900 and\nin Excel, it just doesn't like that.\n\n368\n00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:15.760\nI'm not saying you can't, but\nfor what we're explaining, no.\n\n369\n00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.760\nSo that's what it thinks of, okay,\nthis is our reference table.\n\n370\n00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:27.220\nWell that's how Excel PC was programmed,\nbut look at this one, okay?\n\n371\n00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:30.976\nIf I look at this one, and\nI take the same numbers,\n\n372\n00:21:30.976 --> 00:21:35.902\nand I change it to a short date,\nthat is not the same thing, is it?\n\n373\n00:21:35.902 --> 00:21:41.078\n1 is January 2nd, 1904.\n\n374\n00:21:41.078 --> 00:21:45.210\n[LAUGH] Hmm, yeah, exactly.\n\n375\n00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:48.280\nOkay, so let me give you\na little background over here.\n\n376\n00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:53.110\nSo right in here, this is from Microsoft,\nso basically it's saying that, yes,\n\n377\n00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:55.610\nthis is our dates and\neverything like that.\n\n378\n00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:59.460\nBut it says right here,\nBy default, Microsoft Excel for\n\n379\n00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:03.590\nMacintosh uses the 1904, because of\nthe design of early Macintosh computers,\n\n380\n00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:08.820\ndates before January 1, 1904,\nare not supported, okay?\n\n381\n00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:11.490\nAnd it was intended to prevent\nproblems related to the fact\n\n382\n00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:13.380\nthat 1900 was not a leap year.\n\n383\n00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:16.104\nIf you switch to the 1900 date system,\n\n384\n00:22:16.104 --> 00:22:21.189\nExcel from Macintosh does not support\ndates as early as January 1, 1900.\n\n385\n00:22:21.189 --> 00:22:23.100\nSorry, [LAUGH] you're smiling over there.\n\n386\n00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:26.081\n&gt;&gt; It's funny, I was like, I almost\nbet this has to do with leap year.\n\n387\n00:22:26.081 --> 00:22:31.061\nCuz leap years have all these weird rules,\nlike it's every fourth year,\n\n388\n00:22:31.061 --> 00:22:35.332\nunless it's divisible by,\nunless it's every 400 years.\n\n389\n00:22:35.332 --> 00:22:38.475\nAnd then it's not a leap year because\nwe gotta set back, so I was like,\n\n390\n00:22:38.475 --> 00:22:41.210\nI bet this is related to leap\nyears cuz those are four digits.\n\n391\n00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:41.718\nNo way-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n392\n00:22:41.718 --> 00:22:43.280\n&gt;&gt; It can't be related to leap years.\n\n393\n00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.330\nIt is, yeah, and\n\n394\n00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:48.980\nso that's a little history on here, is\nthat's where you would have some problems.\n\n395\n00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:55.755\nSo you've got to where you have in\nthe serial number of July 5, 1998,\n\n396\n00:22:55.755 --> 00:23:02.115\nare reported two different ways in\nthe two different date systems.\n\n397\n00:23:02.115 --> 00:23:06.485\nThat can be a serious problem\nif you've got going on, right?\n\n398\n00:23:06.485 --> 00:23:08.636\nSo I was like, [SOUND] all right.\n\n399\n00:23:08.636 --> 00:23:12.455\nWell, I'll tell you that\nthis is a preference, okay?\n\n400\n00:23:12.455 --> 00:23:16.464\nAnd this is one I will, to be honest,\nI have glossed over this so many times,\n\n401\n00:23:16.464 --> 00:23:19.927\nI'm just like, [SOUND],\nI don't know what that is, it's okay.\n\n402\n00:23:19.927 --> 00:23:22.100\nI mean, we all do it, right?\n\n403\n00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:26.110\nAll right, well this is a preference,\nper workbook.\n\n404\n00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:34.210\nIn Excel for PC, if I go into\nthe Options and go into Advanced and\n\n405\n00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:39.290\ngo down into calculation,\nright there, okay?\n\n406\n00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:43.310\nUse 1904 date system.\n\n407\n00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:50.290\ni could, if I wanted to, and in this other\nfile, I'm using the Alt+Tab for this.\n\n408\n00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:56.307\nThat's why it's reporting differently,\nbecause this particular workbook,\n\n409\n00:23:56.307 --> 00:24:02.068\nI have the preference down here,\nthat we are using The 1904 date system.\n\n410\n00:24:02.068 --> 00:24:03.247\nOkay, so it's a setting.\n\n411\n00:24:03.247 --> 00:24:06.263\nIt is a preference that you could use.\n\n412\n00:24:06.263 --> 00:24:10.226\nAnd if you're working with really\nold files that might be between a PC\n\n413\n00:24:10.226 --> 00:24:10.960\nand a Mac.\n\n414\n00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.680\nOr maybe somebody has changed\nthe preference in one of your cell files\n\n415\n00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:17.380\neven on your PC to use\nthis 1904 date system.\n\n416\n00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:22.810\nThis could wreak all sorts of\nhavoc on your life, right?\n\n417\n00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:25.560\nAnd especially if you're going now,\nI just wanted to go ahead and\n\n418\n00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:28.810\nbring this back over into\nthe Mac world is if you go\n\n419\n00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:33.860\ninto your Preferences &gt; Calculations,\nit's right there as well.\n\n420\n00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:36.070\nSee, by default, it's not turned on, okay?\n\n421\n00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:40.514\nSo this is Excel for\nMac as what's progressed.\n\n422\n00:24:40.514 --> 00:24:44.962\nI'm pretty sure it stopped using the 1904\ndate system and it updated itself,\n\n423\n00:24:44.962 --> 00:24:47.830\ncuz this has never been\na problem with me using Mac.\n\n424\n00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:51.184\nBut just in case,\nit could be a little weird and\n\n425\n00:24:51.184 --> 00:24:54.289\neven more if you were copying and pasting.\n\n426\n00:24:54.289 --> 00:24:59.170\nSo this is the date in\n1900 if I copy this, okay?\n\n427\n00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:05.440\nI'm going to do a Ctrl+C,\nAlt+Tab to jump over to this one.\n\n428\n00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:08.980\nAnd then, I keep hitting the wrong one,\nsorry, guys.\n\n429\n00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:12.720\nAnd there, that's not the same day, is it?\n\n430\n00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.382\nNo, it is not.\n\n431\n00:25:14.382 --> 00:25:18.950\nIt is off by 1,462 days or\nnumbers remember,\n\n432\n00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:23.421\ncuz we're all just talking\nthe serial numbers.\n\n433\n00:25:23.421 --> 00:25:26.035\nSo that's like ugh, that's not good.\n\n434\n00:25:26.035 --> 00:25:29.550\n[LAUGH] So you have a whole other\n\n435\n00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:32.450\nlittle monkey wrench that\ncould be thrown in there.\n\n436\n00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:36.654\nIf somebody somehow had\ntheir preferences in 1904.\n\n437\n00:25:36.654 --> 00:25:38.617\nNow the thing is on the surface,\n\n438\n00:25:38.617 --> 00:25:41.830\nyou probably would never\neven know that this was on.\n\n439\n00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:43.410\nCuz if you just typing in dates,\n\n440\n00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:47.000\nyou're not seeing the number\nbehind the scenes, right?\n\n441\n00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.560\nSo if you've never even\nlooked at what the number is,\n\n442\n00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:53.230\nyou might be thinking everything is fine,\nokay?\n\n443\n00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:58.369\nReally when you start talking about cross\ncompatibility between two different\n\n444\n00:25:58.369 --> 00:26:03.059\ndate systems, the 1900 date system and\nthe 1904 date systems.\n\n445\n00:26:03.059 --> 00:26:06.716\nWhen you're just trying to copy and paste\nor moving around or somebody opens this\n\n446\n00:26:06.716 --> 00:26:09.870\nwith a different preference and\nthey're like, this is not right.\n\n447\n00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:12.870\nSo just be aware of it.\n\n448\n00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:14.830\nI will say I've never encountered this.\n\n449\n00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:17.150\nI've never had any problems with it.\n\n450\n00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:22.088\nBut I also can tell you I probably\nhave never held a job that is so\n\n451\n00:26:22.088 --> 00:26:26.600\ndate-dependent or\nlike I'm in Excel all day long.\n\n452\n00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:27.990\nI'm doing bookkeeping and\n\n453\n00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:32.840\naccounting, and I'm in charge of all\nthe HR and payroll for a company.\n\n454\n00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.430\nI've never done that.\n\n455\n00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:37.430\nSo I can't say that it's not out there.\n\n456\n00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:42.320\nSo I wanted to let you know\nthat this is what it does.\n\n457\n00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:48.948\nNow, they do talk about a fix down in\nhere to where if you're copying and\n\n458\n00:26:48.948 --> 00:26:56.144\npasting, then you can do some kinda fun\nlittle thing with the paste special.\n\n459\n00:26:56.144 --> 00:26:58.262\nOkay, so let's talk about\npaste special with the values.\n\n460\n00:26:58.262 --> 00:27:00.210\nOkay, I'll just show you really quickly.\n\n461\n00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:05.036\nIf I come back over to nope,\nthis one, I past it, this one.\n\n462\n00:27:05.036 --> 00:27:08.430\nI put off to the side, 1,462, right?\n\n463\n00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:11.030\nCuz if you take this and\nyou copy it, Cmd+C,\n\n464\n00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:16.330\nthen select the range\nthat has the wrong dates.\n\n465\n00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:20.890\nAnd then come over to your Paste Special,\nI could have right-clicked on this.\n\n466\n00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:24.800\nIs this operation that you can subtract,\nhave you ever seen this?\n\n467\n00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.640\nIt's kind of a lesser-known one.\n\n468\n00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.170\nI think it's kind of cute, okay?\n\n469\n00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:34.290\nBut what you're saying is first,\nnotice I did copy the value first,\n\n470\n00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:36.250\nselected the range.\n\n471\n00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:39.510\nAnd then when I paste,\nI want it to subtract.\n\n472\n00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:43.074\nAnd when I click OK and\nif I format this back as a date,\n\n473\n00:27:43.074 --> 00:27:46.330\nthen they're back to\nthe dates that they were.\n\n474\n00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:50.990\nSo you see I'm taking the value,\nthat conversion value, copying it and\n\n475\n00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:53.220\npasting special over this range and\n\n476\n00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:56.610\ntelling it to subtract whatever\nis copied onto my clipboard.\n\n477\n00:27:56.610 --> 00:28:00.670\nSo there is a way that you can fix\nit if you ever encounter this.\n\n478\n00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:05.140\nI've also seen some examples of\npeople doing with a VBA scripting.\n\n479\n00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:07.750\nBut if you're not wanted to jump into VBA,\n\n480\n00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:12.410\nthat is something that you could do,\njust in case you ever come across it.\n\n481\n00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:14.390\nSo I don't know about you, Justin.\n\n482\n00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:17.850\nI find that kind of fascinating,\nI kinda like history like that.\n\n483\n00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:18.792\nAnd of course,\n\n484\n00:28:18.792 --> 00:28:23.299\nwhen you're just fascinating in a sense\nof like that's really not cool.\n\n485\n00:28:23.299 --> 00:28:26.040\nBut it make sense, but\nit doesn't, I don't know.\n\n486\n00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:30.962\nIt's one of those things that\njust makes me go okay, all right.\n\n487\n00:28:30.962 --> 00:28:33.873\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's like one of those Rube Goldberg\n\n488\n00:28:33.873 --> 00:28:36.608\nmachines where it like the one thing\nfalls and hits the other thing and\n\n489\n00:28:36.608 --> 00:28:38.710\nthen you're like that is fascinating.\n\n490\n00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:41.275\nThat's a lot of work to fix and\nI don't know.\n\n491\n00:28:41.275 --> 00:28:47.120\nIt's weird, because I suspect that 1904\nthing was probably before Apple transition\n\n492\n00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:51.210\nto their new version of their operating\nsystem, because I talked about early Macs.\n\n493\n00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:54.482\nIf you're still using a workbook\nfrom one of those early days,\n\n494\n00:28:54.482 --> 00:28:59.220\nmight wanna spend some time to\nmaybe update that a little bit.\n\n495\n00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:03.230\nBut maybe your company is already\nused to referencing from 1904,\n\n496\n00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:06.390\nand luckily that's there, but\nit could lead to a bad hiccup.\n\n497\n00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:10.005\nYour projections for project\ncompletion could be four years off.\n\n498\n00:29:10.005 --> 00:29:11.675\nSo we definitely have\nto keep that in mind.\n\n499\n00:29:11.675 --> 00:29:14.585\nAnd well, keep in mind, we've got\nmore Excel functions coming at you.\n\n500\n00:29:14.585 --> 00:29:16.245\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n501\n00:29:16.245 --> 00:29:19.295\nSo signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n502\n00:29:19.295 --> 00:29:20.135\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n503\n00:29:20.135 --> 00:29:21.917\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.443 --> 00:00:18.403\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison,\nand let me tell you what,\n\n4\n00:00:18.403 --> 00:00:20.099\nwe got some exciting news for you.\n\n5\n00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.992\nMore Excel functions, I know, you asked\nfor them, we brought them back to you.\n\n6\n00:00:23.992 --> 00:00:28.990\nAnd well, in this episode we're gonna be\ntalking about month, day, year, and text.\n\n7\n00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.090\nThat last one seems a little out of line,\nbut luckily we have someone in\n\n8\n00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.190\nthe studio who's gonna keep us in line,\nMs Vonne Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.748\nHow are you today, Vonne?\n&gt;&gt; I feel that's a tall order right there,\n\n10\n00:00:36.748 --> 00:00:38.708\nkeeping you in line [SOUND].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know,\n\n11\n00:00:38.708 --> 00:00:41.895\ncuz I can get a little unruly sometimes.\n&gt;&gt; I know, you're just there like hey,\n\n12\n00:00:41.895 --> 00:00:44.329\ndo this because I'm trying to\nbreak everything your showing so.\n\n13\n00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:45.281\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n14\n00:00:45.281 --> 00:00:47.302\n&gt;&gt; Which is great because it does keep us\n\n15\n00:00:47.302 --> 00:00:49.270\nall in line as to what we're doing.\n\n16\n00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.460\nAnd yes, we are doing month, day,\n\n17\n00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.925\nyear, we're in our date function and\nthen yeah, what's this text?\n\n18\n00:00:56.925 --> 00:01:01.185\nOkay, well, this is where in a date,\nsay I have a specific date,\n\n19\n00:01:01.185 --> 00:01:04.680\nI would like to extract and\ngive me the month out of it.\n\n20\n00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.710\nGive me the day, give me the year.\n\n21\n00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.000\nOkay, that seems pretty straight forward,\nand it is.\n\n22\n00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.770\nAnd in this episode,\nwe're just gonna kinda keep it that way.\n\n23\n00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.920\nWe're going to just show you\nhow it works and then move on.\n\n24\n00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.490\nI will say that these particular\nfunctions you're going to use\n\n25\n00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.070\nin conjunction with other functions.\n\n26\n00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.998\nTo be able to pull things out\nwith maybe with IF statements and\n\n27\n00:01:28.998 --> 00:01:31.473\nall sorts of other Nested functions.\n\n28\n00:01:31.473 --> 00:01:35.585\nSo, learning how this works\nby itself is the first step.\n\n29\n00:01:35.585 --> 00:01:40.051\nAnd then we can go ahead and\nmove on to other more complicated ways of,\n\n30\n00:01:40.051 --> 00:01:43.410\nyou go ahead and\ncomposing them all together.\n\n31\n00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.390\nBut yeah, that text, yeah, I had to\nthrow it in on this particular episode.\n\n32\n00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.720\nTo be honest, you'll probably see this\npop up a couple different places too.\n\n33\n00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.815\nBut in this one, it is specific, because\ntext, what do you think it's gonna do?\n\n34\n00:01:55.815 --> 00:01:59.732\nIt's gonna give us text\nfrom a numerical value and,\n\n35\n00:01:59.732 --> 00:02:02.680\nspecifically this time, with dates.\n\n36\n00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.800\nBecause we all know, if you've\nwatched the Time and Now episode,\n\n37\n00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.320\nif you haven't I definitely\nsuggest you go back there.\n\n38\n00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.120\nEven if you think you know it,\n\n39\n00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.630\nthere's a couple little cute things in\nthere that I think are worth your while.\n\n40\n00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.440\nSo we know that it's a date,\nwe know it's going to pull stuff up,\n\n41\n00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.400\nbut it is a number, right?\n\n42\n00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.490\nSo we type it in as August 1st, 2011, but\n\n43\n00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.886\nit's a number, and August can also be\nrepresented as an eight, wait, is that?\n\n44\n00:02:28.886 --> 00:02:33.010\nNo, eight, okay [LAUGH] I just realized,\nis that the right number or, January,\n\n45\n00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.080\nFebruary, March, April, I had to start\ncounting on my fingers right there.\n\n46\n00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.770\nSo it can be represented\ntwo different ways.\n\n47\n00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.290\nSo that's why I went ahead and\nincluded this function,\n\n48\n00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.100\nthe text function,\nin this particular episode.\n\n49\n00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.880\nSo, why don't we get started?\n\n50\n00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.040\nLet's come on down on the computer,\nand I have a specific file.\n\n51\n00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.278\nNot [INAUDIBLE].\nI probably could have open it before we\n\n52\n00:02:54.278 --> 00:02:55.340\nstarted but guess what?\n\n53\n00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.040\nI forgot, that's okay.\n\n54\n00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.320\nSo now I've got some dates.\n\n55\n00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.330\nThese are just randomly generated dates.\n\n56\n00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.836\nJust to know how I did this.\n\n57\n00:03:02.836 --> 00:03:07.356\nI took a date,\nI think I did a January 1st and\n\n58\n00:03:07.356 --> 00:03:11.519\nthen I did December 31st of 2018.\n\n59\n00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.910\nConverted into numbers then found\nthose numbers and did a Randbetween.\n\n60\n00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.670\nAnd then just went ahead and copied them\ndown to randomly generate these numbers.\n\n61\n00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.860\nAnd then I converted them back to dates.\n\n62\n00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.850\nIsn't that sly there?\n&gt;&gt; I'll tell you what,\n\n63\n00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.230\nit almost feels like cheating.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well for\n\n64\n00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.630\nme when I need to generate random\ninformation, I love using Randbetween.\n\n65\n00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.820\nIf you haven't watched that episode,\ncheck that one out.\n\n66\n00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.170\nPretty simple and I use it all the time.\n\n67\n00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.370\nSo that's what I did.\n\n68\n00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.620\nI have some dates, let's get those letters\n\n69\n00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.810\ncorrectly pronounced, and\nI'd like to extract the month.\n\n70\n00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.840\nThis is a pretty simple function,\nso I'm gonna type it in.\n\n71\n00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.230\nWe're gonna say =, we're gonna type\nin month, that's the one I want.\n\n72\n00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.270\nI hit the Tab to go ahead and complete,\nand put that open parenthesis.\n\n73\n00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.940\nEvaluate this particular cell.\n\n74\n00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.330\nNow, if you look in here, it says serial.\n\n75\n00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.570\nIf you were looking at that and\nit said, I don't understand.\n\n76\n00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.247\nYou don't know that dates are numbers,\nthat might be a little weird.\n\n77\n00:04:10.247 --> 00:04:15.479\nAnd more than that, it is a serial,\na series of numbers, it's a reference so\n\n78\n00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:19.920\nit goes in order, so\nthat's why it's referring to it as serial.\n\n79\n00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.860\nYou say that this is the date.\n\n80\n00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.360\nI'm just kind of in that, make sure you\nclose your parentheses and then hit Enter,\n\n81\n00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.413\nand then it extracts it.\n\n82\n00:04:27.413 --> 00:04:28.600\nIt says it's 8, okay?\n\n83\n00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.260\nI've heard people that's just a left\nfunction in text but this isn't a text.\n\n84\n00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.860\nThis is a date, so\nyou're using date functions.\n\n85\n00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.700\nSo you're saying pull out the month.\n\n86\n00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.680\nThen I will just copy that down by double\nclicking on the fill handle to go ahead\n\n87\n00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.690\nand populate the rest.\n\n88\n00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.800\nAnd it's extracting and giving me\nthe month of that particular cell.\n\n89\n00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.250\nCool, same thing across,\nwe're just gonna use a different function.\n\n90\n00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.524\nWe're gonna use the day function,\nlooking at that cell, give me the day.\n\n91\n00:04:56.524 --> 00:05:01.942\nOkay, there's 7, copy it down by\ndouble-clicking, takes it on out.\n\n92\n00:05:01.942 --> 00:05:08.760\nAnd then the same with the year and\nwe come over here and there you go.\n\n93\n00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.733\nIt extracts out the year and we pull this\ndown or double click it, it's all 2018 so\n\n94\n00:05:13.733 --> 00:05:16.445\nthere's no variation in that and\nthat's it.\n\n95\n00:05:16.445 --> 00:05:22.229\nSo maybe that's something that you would\nthen format as a table of just say count.\n\n96\n00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:26.783\nBecause maybe I need to see how\nmany times we entered invoices for\n\n97\n00:05:26.783 --> 00:05:29.241\nthe month of October or November.\n\n98\n00:05:29.241 --> 00:05:34.380\nSo I count if the cell equals ten and\nthen give me how many.\n\n99\n00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.960\nSo, I mean, there's little\nthings you can do past that.\n\n100\n00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.740\n&gt;&gt; I can see this being\n\n101\n00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.200\nuseful if you wanted to look\nat different charts based on.\n\n102\n00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.980\nI want to look at\na histogram of some quantity\n\n103\n00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.950\nbased on where they divide up in month,\nokay?\n\n104\n00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.820\nWell, now I wanna look only in the month\nof October, and I wanna see how\n\n105\n00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.850\nour sales or our revenue divides up\nover the course of the October month.\n\n106\n00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.610\nOr if you had multiple years,\nyou could continue to just slice and dice.\n\n107\n00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.320\nSo this is very helpful if you\nneed some binning operations or\n\n108\n00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.390\nmaybe even some filter operations.\n\n109\n00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.416\nBinning is what you do in a histogram,\nyou create the fine bins and\n\n110\n00:06:09.416 --> 00:06:12.455\nyou put stuff in bins and\nthat's what you get the histogram with.\n\n111\n00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:13.175\n&gt;&gt; He saw me go.\n\n112\n00:06:13.175 --> 00:06:14.791\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n113\n00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:16.578\n&gt;&gt; I just mouthed the words like,\n\n114\n00:06:16.578 --> 00:06:20.190\nwhat's a, okay, okay, containers?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah, so\n\n115\n00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.160\nyou're slicing and dicing and\nthen you go from here to here is day 1 and\n\n116\n00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.677\nyou start just kind of dropping them in.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I've just never heard that\n\n117\n00:06:27.677 --> 00:06:30.034\nterminology before, but\nI know what you're talking about, so cool.\n\n118\n00:06:30.034 --> 00:06:35.837\nAnd you use this in your programming\nlanguages a lot of times cuz you need to\n\n119\n00:06:35.837 --> 00:06:41.655\npull out dates and, is it similar, or\ndo you actually use day or extract?\n\n120\n00:06:41.655 --> 00:06:44.147\nI don't want to get off\ninto DEV Pro too much but-\n\n121\n00:06:44.147 --> 00:06:45.985\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is very similar.\n\n122\n00:06:45.985 --> 00:06:48.305\nIt's not necessarily just a function, but\n\n123\n00:06:48.305 --> 00:06:53.040\nthe manipulation of dates in\nthe languages I use are very similar.\n\n124\n00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.240\nI try to make date manipulation\nas easy on myself as possible.\n\n125\n00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.660\nSo if I have to I'll go and\npull out external tools.\n\n126\n00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.700\nLuckily, it's kind of built into Excel for\n\n127\n00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:03.595\nyou.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n128\n00:07:03.595 --> 00:07:06.115\nand we've actually talked\nabout this off-camera,\n\n129\n00:07:06.115 --> 00:07:09.120\nbecause dates is so,\nyou have leap years and\n\n130\n00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.680\nFebruary that only has 28 days every once\nin a while and all those kind of things.\n\n131\n00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.370\nIt can get a little weird if you\nthink about how the computer has to\n\n132\n00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:18.370\nthink about this.\n\n133\n00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:22.460\nSo it's just something to\nswirl around your noggin but\n\n134\n00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.570\ndon't think about it too much cuz then\nyou'll be like how does this work?\n\n135\n00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:26.350\nI don't know.\n\n136\n00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:30.670\nOkay so,\nlet's move on to the text function,\n\n137\n00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:36.120\nbecause when we talk about,\nlike I said, July or August.\n\n138\n00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.320\nWe are also thinking month 7 and month 8.\n\n139\n00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.520\nBecause it has a name and\nit also has a numerical value.\n\n140\n00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.580\nSo that's what the text\nfunction is going to do.\n\n141\n00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.990\nI'm not gonna type this one out because\nit has a couple of extra things in it\n\n142\n00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.080\nthat you need to know about.\n\n143\n00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.715\nSo let's go through the dialogue box and\n\n144\n00:07:54.715 --> 00:07:57.590\nthen it's also going to\nprompt us to realize.\n\n145\n00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:02.330\nWe need to know a little bit\nmore about date formats and\n\n146\n00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.220\nthe way that the computer\nthinks about them.\n\n147\n00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.170\nJust keep that in mind.\n\n148\n00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:07.270\nI'll walk you through.\n\n149\n00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:08.310\nWhy don't we start?\n\n150\n00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:10.520\nLet's go to the insert\nfunction dialogue box.\n\n151\n00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.260\nI've already gotten mine in here\ncuz I've been working with it.\n\n152\n00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.570\nSo find the text function, and\nthen you can use the drop down or\n\n153\n00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:19.630\nthe type in, you click OK.\n\n154\n00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.090\nSo it is going to ask you now,\nwhat am I evaluating?\n\n155\n00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:24.650\nWhat do I need to look at?\n\n156\n00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:25.570\nThat's still this cell.\n\n157\n00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.540\nAnd it is a number because it's a date.\n\n158\n00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:33.107\nWell then tell me how you\nwant me to format it as text.\n\n159\n00:08:33.107 --> 00:08:36.196\nSorry, I zoomed in a little too\nmuch off to the side, there we go.\n\n160\n00:08:36.196 --> 00:08:40.908\nSo is a number format in text\nform from the category box on\n\n161\n00:08:40.908 --> 00:08:46.043\nthe number tab in the format\ncells dialogue box not general.\n\n162\n00:08:46.043 --> 00:08:49.782\nAnd that's where you might go, what?\n\n163\n00:08:49.782 --> 00:08:51.779\nI don't understand.\n\n164\n00:08:51.779 --> 00:08:55.970\nWell, I'm not gonna type it in right now\nand then I'll come back to tell you what\n\n165\n00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:59.690\nthat means and where to find\nthe references and more about it.\n\n166\n00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:02.230\nI'm just gonna type mm cuz I'm looking for\nthe month.\n\n167\n00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:05.580\nSo I'm typing in two lower case ms and\n\n168\n00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.810\nI'm doing it in the dialogue box cuz I'm\ngonna hit the Tab key to complete this.\n\n169\n00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:16.000\nAnd do notice, it is putting this\nin quotes, that is very important.\n\n170\n00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.190\nThat's why I didn't wanna\ntype it in to begin with.\n\n171\n00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:22.681\nOne cuz I,\n[LAUGH] didn't want to forget it, and two,\n\n172\n00:09:22.681 --> 00:09:26.728\nto show you that it is gonna do that and\nit is resulting in 08.\n\n173\n00:09:26.728 --> 00:09:31.800\nThat's not text, hold on, I'll come back.\n\n174\n00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:36.820\nBut it is going to do that, and\nthis is where understanding\n\n175\n00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:42.900\nhow the custom formats or\nhow it understands things is important.\n\n176\n00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.926\nI have this website, okay now,\nthis is specifically for date, so\n\n177\n00:09:45.926 --> 00:09:49.344\nthere is more things that you can do\nwith the text function than just dates.\n\n178\n00:09:49.344 --> 00:09:52.328\nOkay, so I don't want you to think\nthat this is the only thing it does.\n\n179\n00:09:52.328 --> 00:09:57.726\nBut if I was looking at dates, and\nsometimes it puts the day before the month\n\n180\n00:09:57.726 --> 00:10:03.425\nand then the month is just a three letter\nabbreviation versus fully typed out.\n\n181\n00:10:03.425 --> 00:10:08.190\nWell, that's because it understands within\nthis custom number format or the date\n\n182\n00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:15.460\nformatting that there are particular\ncodes that it understands right here.\n\n183\n00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:19.140\nIf I want the months as 1 through 12,\n\n184\n00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:23.570\nwithout the 0 in front of it,\nthen you just use a single m.\n\n185\n00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:29.210\nThe one that used as two ms, that's where\nit's going to put a zero in front of it.\n\n186\n00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:32.260\nSo that way, they're always two digits.\n\n187\n00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:38.270\nIf I wanted to do the three-letter\nabbreviations of your month, use three ms.\n\n188\n00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:43.100\nIf you want it full typed out then\nyou go ahead and use four, okay?\n\n189\n00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.073\nIs this more to your coding stuff?\n\n190\n00:10:45.073 --> 00:10:47.935\nDon't they use ms and ds?\n&gt;&gt; It's very similar.\n\n191\n00:10:47.935 --> 00:10:52.845\nYou'll always have something for\nformatting dates in whatever respective\n\n192\n00:10:52.845 --> 00:10:56.340\nprogram you're using that has what's\ncalled a domain specific language.\n\n193\n00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:59.560\nThat's always gonna have this\nkind of mini formatting language.\n\n194\n00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.640\nThe m and the mm and I see the d and\n\n195\n00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.850\nthe dd, yeah,\nthose are very similar to what I use.\n\n196\n00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.930\nSome of them are a little bit\ndifferent but don't worry,\n\n197\n00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:08.860\nif you know them in Excel and\nyou see them in other places.\n\n198\n00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:12.360\nIt's gonna be real easy, once you learn\none, to kinda just map them over.\n\n199\n00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.730\nSo don't think,\nI've got to memorize all that?\n\n200\n00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:18.570\nThey actually end up being really\nhelpful in other capacities as well.\n\n201\n00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:23.430\nAlso this is a common format of saying\nthis is how I want you to format the date\n\n202\n00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.330\nif you have someone actually\ntrying to complete task for\n\n203\n00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:27.510\nyou so.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n204\n00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:32.870\nwe talked about this in number formatting\nin the Excel Essentials episodes.\n\n205\n00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:36.220\nAnd then also if you're\ndoing custom number formats,\n\n206\n00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:38.220\nwhen do you put a 0 versus a 9?\n\n207\n00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.560\nDoes it keep the preceding 0 or\ndoes it go to the 9?\n\n208\n00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.730\nThere's all sorts of different variations,\nI'm concentrating just on\n\n209\n00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:46.920\ndates in this particular episode,\nbecause we're talking about dates.\n\n210\n00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:50.950\nSo you could see the single ds\nversus the double, triple, and\n\n211\n00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:55.410\nquadruple ds to go ahead and extract and\n\n212\n00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:59.740\nformat the date as text\nin whatever format.\n\n213\n00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:04.464\nSo that's where I'm doing the Alt Tab,\nwhere I did two ms.\n\n214\n00:12:04.464 --> 00:12:09.084\nIf I came in here and did three,\nnotice that it just goes ahead and\n\n215\n00:12:09.084 --> 00:12:14.500\nabbreviates it, and then if I do four,\nit's going to return August.\n\n216\n00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.810\nThat's pretty cool, okay?\n\n217\n00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:21.222\nSo and then if I go with that,\nnow it's extracting this as text,\n\n218\n00:12:21.222 --> 00:12:24.180\ncool, same thing over here.\n\n219\n00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.780\nNow this time we're going to try and\ntype it out.\n\n220\n00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:29.110\nOkay, we're going to open the parenthesis.\n\n221\n00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:34.610\nThis is the cell, comma, quote, cuz you\nneed to make sure they're in quotes.\n\n222\n00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:37.920\nLet's go with three, right?\n\n223\n00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.620\nAnd did I type it in right?\n\n224\n00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:40.596\nYes, I did, yay.\n\n225\n00:12:40.596 --> 00:12:43.835\n[LAUGH] I like the function dialog box,\njust so you know, okay?\n\n226\n00:12:43.835 --> 00:12:48.390\nAnd I could go ahead and\nformat whichever way I wanted to.\n\n227\n00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:53.170\nThat way I know that it is a day\ninstead of a numerical value and\n\n228\n00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:56.950\nthen the same with the text with the year,\n\n229\n00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:01.600\nwe'll go ahead and do it's A2.\n\n230\n00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.290\nThis one you only have two or four.\n\n231\n00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:08.710\nOkay, so if I did open quote YY\nclose the quotes close bracket,\n\n232\n00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:10.950\nthat is not a bracket\nthat is a parenthesis.\n\n233\n00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:15.391\nAnd then it is going to give me\na two digit year for that, okay?\n\n234\n00:13:15.391 --> 00:13:21.138\nPretty cool, very functional and\nhow you can combine with other things.\n\n235\n00:13:21.138 --> 00:13:27.309\nThese are all functions, so\nif you wanted this to be straight text.\n\n236\n00:13:27.309 --> 00:13:28.896\nIt's funny I've done so\n\n237\n00:13:28.896 --> 00:13:33.517\nmany episodes that I feel like I say\nthis every single day, because I do.\n\n238\n00:13:33.517 --> 00:13:35.711\nBut you might not watch\nany of the other episodes.\n\n239\n00:13:35.711 --> 00:13:41.110\nSo you need to make sure that you\nunderstand that this is not text or\n\n240\n00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:42.492\ndata by itself.\n\n241\n00:13:42.492 --> 00:13:47.356\nYou're going to need to copy and\npaste it into itself as values.\n\n242\n00:13:47.356 --> 00:13:52.672\nOr, when you copy it and\nbring it somewhere else,\n\n243\n00:13:52.672 --> 00:13:58.380\nyou need to make sure that\nyou paste it as values only.\n\n244\n00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.300\nCuz it's trying to keep that formula,\n\n245\n00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:04.373\nbecause that's what it does when you copy,\nso you paste at Azure values.\n\n246\n00:14:04.373 --> 00:14:07.190\nOr you can go up to here, and paste,\n\n247\n00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:11.190\nI know this isn't a different place, or\nif I came back over to here, you copy it.\n\n248\n00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:15.080\nAnd then you paste it right back\non top of itself as a value.\n\n249\n00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:20.420\nSo make sure that you know that you need\nto do that, if you need this information,\n\n250\n00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:24.100\nin its pure data format,\nnot in its function.\n\n251\n00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:25.797\nI feel like you have\na question over there, Justin.\n\n252\n00:14:25.797 --> 00:14:27.930\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna ask you,\n\n253\n00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:30.880\nmaybe I'm getting a little crazy here,\n\n254\n00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:37.010\nmaybe this is beyond scope.\n\n255\n00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:39.660\nSo each one of those we had either\nthe month or the day or the year,\n\n256\n00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:44.070\ncan we combine those in some other pattern\nand have that applied to the date as well?\n\n257\n00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.835\nSo, [LAUGH] better yet,\ncan we try something?\n\n258\n00:14:49.835 --> 00:14:51.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Sure.\n\n259\n00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:56.214\n&gt;&gt; All right, so can we in the next\n\n260\n00:14:56.214 --> 00:15:01.635\ncolumn over, can we equal text?\n\n261\n00:15:01.635 --> 00:15:06.445\nAnd A2 is fine and then quote,\n\n262\n00:15:06.445 --> 00:15:11.270\nhow about four ys, dash, mm?\n\n263\n00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:14.921\nAnd, I mean, if this works then we\nknow the other ones work, and boom.\n\n264\n00:15:14.921 --> 00:15:16.270\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's what you're asking.\n\n265\n00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:20.796\nSo I'm like,\nI don't understand the question,\n\n266\n00:15:20.796 --> 00:15:24.256\nthat's why I'm like, maybe [LAUGH].\n\n267\n00:15:24.256 --> 00:15:29.630\nSo you're talking about the patterns\nof how you wanted to extract that out.\n\n268\n00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:34.897\nAnd if I needed to I could go -dddd,\n\n269\n00:15:34.897 --> 00:15:37.420\nlike that?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n270\n00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.420\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yes, okay,\n\n271\n00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:40.950\nyou can [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n272\n00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:46.110\nthe only reason I can think of using this\ninstead of maybe a custom number format or\n\n273\n00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:51.720\nsomething is maybe you need to have this\nas a changeable value in a cell reference.\n\n274\n00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:54.610\nTo where depending on how you\nreport it to various people.\n\n275\n00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:57.100\nYou can just turn that to a different one.\n\n276\n00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.160\nRight, be like, I need this format for\n\n277\n00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.690\nall my government clients\nbecause it has to be here.\n\n278\n00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:02.470\nI need this format for\n\n279\n00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:05.380\nall my corporate clients and\nmaybe you're giving them the same report.\n\n280\n00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:08.920\nBut that's, maybe even make that a drop\ndown and get click there's my format,\n\n281\n00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.000\nall your dates change and then boom boom,\n\n282\n00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.313\ndone.\n&gt;&gt; That's really good.\n\n283\n00:16:12.313 --> 00:16:13.137\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n284\n00:16:13.137 --> 00:16:15.081\n&gt;&gt; No, I really like that example and\n\n285\n00:16:15.081 --> 00:16:18.048\nI didn't even think to maybe\nput it in that context.\n\n286\n00:16:18.048 --> 00:16:21.750\nBut yeah, because, like you said,\nwe're doing single ones, but\n\n287\n00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:24.060\nyou can combine them together.\n\n288\n00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:28.050\nAnd use the function of text\n\n289\n00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:31.950\nto give you a specific formatting that\nyou can't maybe necessarily achieve.\n\n290\n00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:36.650\nOr maybe it's even easier to understand\ndoing it this way and giving it a pattern\n\n291\n00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:39.010\nand, like you said, I'm just going\nto go ahead and do it differently.\n\n292\n00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:41.250\nIt's all the same stuff,\nI’m just gonna go ahead.\n\n293\n00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:45.640\nBut of course, making sure you're not\npacing it into another location for\n\n294\n00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.830\nyour report as the function.\n\n295\n00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:52.630\nYou pace it as the values, because in\nthat sense, you only need the value.\n\n296\n00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:55.620\nYou don't need the function\nto come over or\n\n297\n00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:59.668\nbe part of the report or\nthe data that you are reporting.\n\n298\n00:16:59.668 --> 00:17:04.791\nSo, right, sometimes, anytime Justin\nhas a question I get a little nervous.\n\n299\n00:17:04.791 --> 00:17:06.684\nI'm like, what is he gonna ask me?\n\n300\n00:17:06.684 --> 00:17:09.742\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, and just in case my question,\n\n301\n00:17:09.742 --> 00:17:13.230\nsometimes my clarity,\ncuz I’m in my brain there.\n\n302\n00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:16.191\nJust to put this in context,\nI had very specific date,\n\n303\n00:17:16.191 --> 00:17:21.560\ntime formats that I had to adhere\nto in a previous role using.\n\n304\n00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:22.960\nThis is what we want it reported as.\n\n305\n00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.930\nSo I had to write a bunch of these format\nstrings in the things that I did, so\n\n306\n00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:27.858\nI was like could I do this in Excel?\n\n307\n00:17:27.858 --> 00:17:31.920\nBut you can combine those and then it just\nkind of parses and goes you want a year,\n\n308\n00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:36.660\nand a month, and\na day as the whole date written out?\n\n309\n00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:37.430\nYeah, you can do that.\n\n310\n00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:41.040\nSo having that dynamism, I'm like okay.\n\n311\n00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.890\nI can see why text is in this episode and\nhow it can be so\n\n312\n00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:45.333\nhelpful.\n&gt;&gt; And honestly,\n\n313\n00:17:45.333 --> 00:17:48.999\nI started to get a little, cuz I get\nmy own brand, I'm like do we need other\n\n314\n00:17:48.999 --> 00:17:52.183\nquotes and then we have to concatenate\nit and all that kind of stuff?\n\n315\n00:17:52.183 --> 00:17:54.792\nJust to put this in context,\nI had very specific date,\n\n316\n00:17:54.792 --> 00:17:57.740\ntime formats that I had to adhere\nto in a previous role using.\n\n317\n00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:01.430\nSo it's not anything that\nyou had to put together.\n\n318\n00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:05.320\nIt's not text necessarily, it's not\nstrings that you have to put together.\n\n319\n00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:09.940\nIt's just what it thinks of and you're\njust saying spit it out this way, so good.\n\n320\n00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:13.950\nI thought that was a great\nepisode because I knew it, but\n\n321\n00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:16.810\nI didn't know it,\nbecause I didn't think to say it that way.\n\n322\n00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:21.310\nSo that's why we always have hosts\nwith us to keep us on our toes and\n\n323\n00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:22.370\nto keep you out there.\n\n324\n00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:27.060\nSaying yeah, that sounds like a really\ngreat way to use it, so thank you there,\n\n325\n00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:30.350\nJustin.\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne, I think I can mirror that,\n\n326\n00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:33.130\npart of the strengths that we have\nis we have different backgrounds.\n\n327\n00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:36.720\nAnd different ways of thinking\nabout any one respective thing.\n\n328\n00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.290\nSo, we can poke at it, we can break it,\n\n329\n00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:42.030\nwe can add to each other's understandings,\nand that what we're here to help you do.\n\n330\n00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:44.870\nSo, hope you enjoyed that but for\nnow we're going to go ahead and\n\n331\n00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:45.650\nget out of here.\n\n332\n00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:48.700\nSo, signing off for Office Pro TV I've\nbeen your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n333\n00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:49.212\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n334\n00:18:49.212 --> 00:18:50.525\n&gt;&gt; And we will see next time.\n\n335\n00:18:50.525 -->

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.535 --> 00:00:19.367\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and\nwell, we got more Excel functions.\n\n4\n00:00:19.367 --> 00:00:21.284\nYou know we couldn't leave\nyou hanging like that.\n\n5\n00:00:21.284 --> 00:00:26.095\nAnd in particular, we're going to be\ntalking about CONCAT and TEXTJOIN.\n\n6\n00:00:26.095 --> 00:00:29.018\nOdd word that first word, but luckily we\nhave someone who's gonna make sure we have\n\n7\n00:00:29.018 --> 00:00:31.272\nthe clarity that we need in order\nto use these effectively, Ms.\n\n8\n00:00:31.272 --> 00:00:34.261\nVonne Smith, how you doing today Vonne?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing pretty good, how you doing?\n\n9\n00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:36.148\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic, and you and\n\n10\n00:00:36.148 --> 00:00:40.532\nI were talking before the show, it's\nlike we talked the same language now but\n\n11\n00:00:40.532 --> 00:00:42.160\njust in different context.\n\n12\n00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.030\nSo we're gonna be talking\nabout concatenation, I guess,\n\n13\n00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.920\nand joining text together?\n&gt;&gt; You are correct.\n\n14\n00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.386\n[LAUGH] Yes, cuz we host each\nother shows and we're doing\n\n15\n00:00:51.386 --> 00:00:56.128\na lot of a programming fundamentals\nright now with your side on DevPro.TV.\n\n16\n00:00:56.128 --> 00:01:01.470\nAnd I'm just like, this is exactly what I\ndo in Excel cuz it's all the same, really.\n\n17\n00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.679\nWe talk about it but Excel functions,\n\n18\n00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:07.061\nthey're really just programming\nlike stuff in the back,\n\n19\n00:01:07.061 --> 00:01:11.823\nlike it's all in the same whether you're\ndoing Python or Excel or Javascript like\n\n20\n00:01:11.823 --> 00:01:16.370\nit's pretty much the same thing just\nwhatever flavor you're working with.\n\n21\n00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.072\nSo, but don't let that scare you cuz\nyou're like wait, you just said Python and\n\n22\n00:01:19.072 --> 00:01:21.008\nJavascript, I have no idea\nwhat you're talking about.\n\n23\n00:01:21.008 --> 00:01:26.905\nThat's okay, we're going to keep it in the\nExcel world and talk about joining texts.\n\n24\n00:01:26.905 --> 00:01:32.570\nCuz there's quite a lot of things that you\ncan do with calculating numbers in Excel,\n\n25\n00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.595\nbut what about text,\nwe use text a lot in Excel.\n\n26\n00:01:36.595 --> 00:01:41.206\nAnd so there's gonna be many\nfunctions that we can do with text.\n\n27\n00:01:41.206 --> 00:01:42.900\nSo I figure we'll start,\n\n28\n00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.905\nI'm not exactly sure where I'm gonna\nput this in the program or the library,\n\n29\n00:01:47.905 --> 00:01:52.525\nbut to me I feel like this is a good way\nto start with using text in Excel and\n\n30\n00:01:52.525 --> 00:01:55.489\nthe text functions.\n&gt;&gt; I agree because this is one of those\n\n31\n00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:58.197\ntimes where we can,\nwe can create derived values.\n\n32\n00:01:58.197 --> 00:02:01.257\nWhat I mean by derived, let's say you\nhave an Excel sheet that has first and\n\n33\n00:02:01.257 --> 00:02:03.662\nlast name, but you need the full name.\n\n34\n00:02:03.662 --> 00:02:08.027\nWell, there is no point in having paying\nsomeone to go click, click, paste, copy,\n\n35\n00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:09.200\nblah, blah, blah.\n\n36\n00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.940\nJust derive that value from\nthe other two columns.\n\n37\n00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.250\nOr an address where you have it\ndelineated by a street, city, state,\n\n38\n00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.382\nzip code, what if you need that in a very\nparticular form, you're making labels.\n\n39\n00:02:20.382 --> 00:02:21.790\nJust use an Excel function.\n\n40\n00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.868\nI think this is paramount in trying to\nfigure out how to be as lazy as possible\n\n41\n00:02:25.868 --> 00:02:29.365\nwhen actually deriving all those things.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, I was also like,\n\n42\n00:02:29.365 --> 00:02:31.390\ndid you look at my exercise\nfiles before we started?\n\n43\n00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.374\nBecause this is exactly\nwhat we're going to do.\n\n44\n00:02:32.374 --> 00:02:34.861\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, interestingly enough,\n\n45\n00:02:34.861 --> 00:02:39.560\nI'll tell you, I haven't even looked\nat the notes other than the title.\n\n46\n00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.030\nThose are things that I have done and\nI have done frequently.\n\n47\n00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.320\nWhere I'm like, I just need these\ntwo things kinda squished together.\n\n48\n00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.970\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n49\n00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.410\nwhen you said the title of this show,\nthat's probably a good place to start.\n\n50\n00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.950\nWhy don't we go ahead and come down into\nthe computer because the title of this\n\n51\n00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.600\nepisode are functions in the function\nlibrary that we're going to go over.\n\n52\n00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.572\nBut they're new, okay?\n\n53\n00:03:02.572 --> 00:03:09.120\nCONCAT is a new function that is only\navailable as an Office 365 subscriber and\n\n54\n00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.934\nyou need to make sure you have\nthe latest version of Office,\n\n55\n00:03:13.934 --> 00:03:16.844\nwhich right now is Excel 2016.\n\n56\n00:03:16.844 --> 00:03:20.390\nYou're like, but\nhow is it different than concatenate?\n\n57\n00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.440\nIt's the same thing and\nI had a silly joke.\n\n58\n00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.300\nAnd I'm like CONCAT, yeah, it's not a with\ncat, cuz we always talk about cats here.\n\n59\n00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.593\nIt's actually joining text, I know.\n\n60\n00:03:30.593 --> 00:03:33.210\n[LAUGH] Anyways, we have it.\n\n61\n00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.700\nIt is going to replace\nthe CONCATENATE function.\n\n62\n00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.820\nAnd it's still there, okay?\n\n63\n00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.780\nYou can use CONCAT or CONCATENATE,\nthey really don't operate any differently.\n\n64\n00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:51.440\nFrom everything that I can see,\nthey're pretty much the exact\n\n65\n00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.945\nsame and it's backwards compatibility for\nolder versions of Excel.\n\n66\n00:03:57.945 --> 00:04:02.454\nThat's being said,\nTEXTJOIN is also a newer function that is\n\n67\n00:04:02.454 --> 00:04:05.844\navailable as an Office 365 subscription.\n\n68\n00:04:05.844 --> 00:04:08.561\nAnd you need to have\nthe latest version of Office.\n\n69\n00:04:08.561 --> 00:04:09.826\nOkay, this one's pretty cool.\n\n70\n00:04:09.826 --> 00:04:13.850\nI'll tell you right now, this function,\nI'm like, ooh, that's neat.\n\n71\n00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.100\nSo we're going to go through those.\n\n72\n00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.180\nBut we're gonna go over some other\nways that you can join text together,\n\n73\n00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.880\nconcatenate text from different cells.\n\n74\n00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.006\nSo we're going to start off with\nthe old way, I guess you can say or\n\n75\n00:04:28.006 --> 00:04:30.121\nanother way that you can do this.\n\n76\n00:04:30.121 --> 00:04:32.187\nYes, just what you said, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n77\n00:04:32.187 --> 00:04:33.218\n&gt;&gt; The full name.\n\n78\n00:04:33.218 --> 00:04:34.174\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry Vonne,\n\n79\n00:04:34.174 --> 00:04:38.233\nI did not realize I was stealing all your\nthunder here cuz I was just thinking about\n\n80\n00:04:38.233 --> 00:04:42.373\nthe things that I've done before that I\nhad a use for these respective functions.\n\n81\n00:04:42.373 --> 00:04:46.420\nAnd yeah, it just so\nhappens you also use them.\n\n82\n00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.977\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n83\n00:04:46.977 --> 00:04:47.684\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n84\n00:04:47.684 --> 00:04:49.259\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's also one of the most common\n\n85\n00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:52.217\nthings that people wanna know in Excel\nis I have a first and a last name, and\n\n86\n00:04:52.217 --> 00:04:53.103\nI need the full name.\n\n87\n00:04:53.103 --> 00:04:55.030\nOkay, so\nthat's what we're going to go with.\n\n88\n00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.750\nI have some cats here.\n\n89\n00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:04.190\n[LAUGH] Yes, I have Bishop Timothy Smith,\nand we've got, who else we got?\n\n90\n00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.680\nYeah, we got a couple other ones in here,\nso Pumpkin Winter Squash.\n\n91\n00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.318\nThat was my cat.\n\n92\n00:05:10.318 --> 00:05:13.992\nAll right, so I need to go ahead and\nconcatenate these together.\n\n93\n00:05:13.992 --> 00:05:20.695\nBut I'm gonna show you that you can\ndo something with the ampersand.\n\n94\n00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:24.293\nNow, I'm starting off a function or\nformula with an equal sign.\n\n95\n00:05:24.293 --> 00:05:28.160\nI'm then going to select this cell,\n\n96\n00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:34.034\nI'm gonna use the &amp;,\nthen this cell, &amp;, this cell.\n\n97\n00:05:34.034 --> 00:05:36.194\nThat's totally valid.\n\n98\n00:05:36.194 --> 00:05:40.920\nIt does exactly what you said,\ntake this, and this,\n\n99\n00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.770\nand this, with the operator of the &amp;,\nthat's fine.\n\n100\n00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:51.060\nNow notice that it takes it straight\nout so there's no spaces in there.\n\n101\n00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.870\nAnd I've used this ampersand\nin like the sum if.\n\n102\n00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.760\nI mean, we've seen this in other episodes.\n\n103\n00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.540\nSo there's nothing wrong with this.\n\n104\n00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.175\nBut let me go ahead and come back into\nhere, because if I wanted to add a space,\n\n105\n00:06:02.175 --> 00:06:06.290\nsay A2, okay, so that would be Alice.\n\n106\n00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:11.980\nAnd then I want you to add in open quote,\nspace, close the quote.\n\n107\n00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.008\nBecause you need to say\nthis is a string of text.\n\n108\n00:06:14.008 --> 00:06:17.470\nAnytime you have any things in quotes,\nit's going to be a string.\n\n109\n00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.950\nAnd then another ampersand, then the cell.\n\n110\n00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:26.675\nThen take this cell and\na another space and the last cell.\n\n111\n00:06:26.675 --> 00:06:31.160\nAnd if I hit Enter,\nthen it puts in spaces.\n\n112\n00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.115\nTotally fine, there is nothing\nwrong with doing it this way.\n\n113\n00:06:33.115 --> 00:06:35.900\nOkay, and I've actually looked at this.\n\n114\n00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.740\nI went through and\nI tried to scare the internet,\n\n115\n00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:44.566\nwhy would you wanna use ampersands\nover the CONCATENATE function.\n\n116\n00:06:44.566 --> 00:06:47.290\nAnd all I got was some people\nlike to type it out and\n\n117\n00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.010\nsome people like to use a function,\nI mean that was all, okay.\n\n118\n00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.520\nSo I couldn't really find any tried and\ntrue,\n\n119\n00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.223\nlike this is why and this is why not.\n\n120\n00:06:56.223 --> 00:07:00.733\nSo let's just go with, hey,\ngo with it if you feel like it, okay?\n\n121\n00:07:00.733 --> 00:07:04.894\nAnd yes, you could go ahead and use your\nrelative reference and copy down and\n\n122\n00:07:04.894 --> 00:07:06.659\nit's going to do exactly that.\n\n123\n00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:15.990\nGreat, now the CONCATENATE function is\nthe same idea just written differently.\n\n124\n00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:20.430\nI think it's easiest if you go through\nthe Insert Function dialogue box with\n\n125\n00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.350\nany function that you're just\nstarting out with cuz it makes it\n\n126\n00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:25.640\na little easier to walk\nyou through anything.\n\n127\n00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.010\nSo let's go with Cheedo Randy Sticks.\n\n128\n00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:29.660\nOkay, there we go.\n\n129\n00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.930\nWe'll go ahead and\nclick the Insert Function dialog box.\n\n130\n00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.240\nCONCATENATE is in your Text functions.\n\n131\n00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:41.890\nSo if I go down and choose the category\nof Text and you go through here.\n\n132\n00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:48.120\nIf you look, I don't even see\nCONCATENATE in here, right?\n\n133\n00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.046\nI see CONCAT, that's because, of course,\n\n134\n00:07:51.046 --> 00:07:55.210\nthey're trying to phase you all\nout of using that old function.\n\n135\n00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:58.448\nSo that way you would use CONCAT, right?\n\n136\n00:07:58.448 --> 00:08:03.096\nBut anyway, if I really,\nreally wanted to use CONCATENATE.\n\n137\n00:08:03.096 --> 00:08:07.187\nThe way that you could do it to make\nit kinda pop up is if you start\n\n138\n00:08:07.187 --> 00:08:12.360\ntyping it out, well, let's make\nsure you say C-O-N, okay, concat.\n\n139\n00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:16.023\nAnd then notice that we have CONCAT and\nCONCATENATE.\n\n140\n00:08:16.023 --> 00:08:19.520\nNotice there's a little\nkind of warning down here.\n\n141\n00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:24.112\nIt doesn't say anything past\njust like hey, warning,\n\n142\n00:08:24.112 --> 00:08:27.736\ndanger, Will Rogers, that's bad.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n143\n00:08:27.736 --> 00:08:29.109\n&gt;&gt; It's just old, okay?\n\n144\n00:08:29.109 --> 00:08:32.036\nAll it's saying is that you\nreally need to use the other one.\n\n145\n00:08:32.036 --> 00:08:36.540\nBut I really wanna show you concatenate,\njust because once you get it to\n\n146\n00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:41.120\nwhere you've half written this out,\nyou've gotten the function name in there.\n\n147\n00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.270\nThen, go ahead and click into\nthe insert function dialogue box.\n\n148\n00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:47.530\nYou can do that any time,\nyou kinda jump in and out of typing.\n\n149\n00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:49.240\nLet me go back to here.\n\n150\n00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.090\nAnd now it just says hey,\nwhat do you want to join together?\n\n151\n00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.987\nAnd notice that it says,\nyou can join up to 255 text strings.\n\n152\n00:08:55.987 --> 00:09:00.600\nI could pull together that many cells,\nthat's a lot.\n\n153\n00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.610\nBut at least we know that we can do that.\n\n154\n00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:07.008\nSo with our cursor here in text one, we\nsay I would like to concatenate this cell,\n\n155\n00:09:07.008 --> 00:09:12.700\nand this cell, and this cell.\n\n156\n00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:16.570\nYou're gonna get the same result that\nI showed with the ampersand that is\n\n157\n00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:18.920\nnot gonna do the spaces, okay?\n\n158\n00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:22.280\nBut the way it's written,\nit's just like okay,\n\n159\n00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:25.640\ninstead of ampersand we're just\nconcatenating all of these cells.\n\n160\n00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:32.310\nThis is where in a dialog box, you could\ndelete this and just type in the space.\n\n161\n00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:34.902\nYou don't put the quotes around it,\nbecause as soon as you Tab,\n\n162\n00:09:34.902 --> 00:09:36.250\nit's gonna do it for you, okay?\n\n163\n00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:39.602\nSo that's another kind of like ooh,\nI forgot to close a quote.\n\n164\n00:09:39.602 --> 00:09:41.600\nDo it here, it does it for you.\n\n165\n00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.160\nSo then I say we'll go\nwith this particular cell.\n\n166\n00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.088\nHit the Tab, hit the Space, make sure.\n\n167\n00:09:47.088 --> 00:09:49.930\nThis is where I almost started.\n\n168\n00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:52.750\nI went ahead and go like let's get there.\n\n169\n00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:53.760\nWrong space.\n\n170\n00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.765\nMake sure you get your cursor into\nthe field of where you're populating.\n\n171\n00:09:57.765 --> 00:10:01.098\nThat's one of the things in\nusing the insert dialogue box\n\n172\n00:10:01.098 --> 00:10:03.050\nis I get going too fast, okay?\n\n173\n00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:05.460\nMove your cursor along the way.\n\n174\n00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:10.530\nAnd so now I get the same exact results\njust written a little bit differently\n\n175\n00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:15.230\nusing the CONCATENATE\nversus the ampersand, okay?\n\n176\n00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:16.410\nAnd we can just go ahead and\n\n177\n00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:20.460\npull down, and we've got our concatenate.\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne,\n\n178\n00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.320\nit was kind of interesting.\n\n179\n00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.619\nAnd you said CONCAT versus CONCATENATE.\n\n180\n00:10:23.619 --> 00:10:28.491\nAnd I saw that little triangle with the\nexclamation point, if I'm not mistaken,\n\n181\n00:10:28.491 --> 00:10:30.006\nI think that's called.\n\n182\n00:10:30.006 --> 00:10:31.513\nI don't know if it's called that here, but\n\n183\n00:10:31.513 --> 00:10:33.402\nit's called the deprecation\nnotice in other places.\n\n184\n00:10:33.402 --> 00:10:36.199\nAnd what that means is it's\nstill available now, but\n\n185\n00:10:36.199 --> 00:10:38.940\nyou should not use it for new projects.\n\n186\n00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:40.930\nBecause eventually,\nit will probably go away.\n\n187\n00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:45.465\nWith that said, you're probably\nstill gonna encounter this.\n\n188\n00:10:45.465 --> 00:10:50.051\nAnd I wonder if one of the things is,\nis there removing the limitation, 255?\n\n189\n00:10:50.051 --> 00:10:55.081\nThis concat also have a 255-limit or\nis it beyond that?\n\n190\n00:10:55.081 --> 00:10:55.907\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question.\n\n191\n00:10:55.907 --> 00:10:58.171\n&gt;&gt; That's what I was almost assuming like\n\n192\n00:10:58.171 --> 00:10:59.770\nthen you could just join more.\n\n193\n00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.579\nNo, I looked this up and and\n\n194\n00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:06.823\nthe concat has the same that you\ncan have 254 text arguments.\n\n195\n00:11:06.823 --> 00:11:10.588\nSo 254, not 255, okay?\n\n196\n00:11:10.588 --> 00:11:15.883\nAnd it cannot exceed\n32,767 total characters,\n\n197\n00:11:15.883 --> 00:11:19.572\nand that's concat not concatenate.\n\n198\n00:11:19.572 --> 00:11:22.830\nSo I tried to look in this way like what?\n\n199\n00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:26.697\nI typed why are they are going to concat?\n\n200\n00:11:26.697 --> 00:11:28.916\nI couldn't find that either.\n\n201\n00:11:28.916 --> 00:11:30.681\nThat was a little hidden.\n\n202\n00:11:30.681 --> 00:11:36.770\nAnd with the syntax, concatenate versus\nconcat does the exact same thing.\n\n203\n00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:41.950\nAt the time of this recording,\nI have not found a logical answer\n\n204\n00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:47.249\nfrom Microsoft as to why they\njust shortened the function name.\n\n205\n00:11:47.249 --> 00:11:49.970\nOkay, maybe it's out there, but\nI haven't found it just yet.\n\n206\n00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:56.119\nSo for now, we're just gonna be like okay,\nwe're just gonna use concat, wonderful.\n\n207\n00:11:56.119 --> 00:11:58.579\nNow you already saw me\ndo it with concatenate,\n\n208\n00:11:58.579 --> 00:12:00.840\nthere's nothing different here.\n\n209\n00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.850\nSo I would just do the same thing.\n\n210\n00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:07.640\nUsing the dialogue box,\nit's a lot easier going this way I feel.\n\n211\n00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:13.439\nAnd we will go ahead and add that in\ntogether, add the space, oops, see?\n\n212\n00:12:13.439 --> 00:12:17.182\nI did it again, and I told you to do\nsomething and then I didn't do it myself.\n\n213\n00:12:17.182 --> 00:12:20.991\nAdd that, Tab, Space, Tab, cell.\n\n214\n00:12:20.991 --> 00:12:26.694\nPerfect, done,\ndouble-click the fill handle.\n\n215\n00:12:26.694 --> 00:12:29.570\nI'm not sure if I throw that in here and\nthere in these different episodes.\n\n216\n00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:33.355\nDifferent ways to go ahead and just\npopulate down instead of dragging it down.\n\n217\n00:12:33.355 --> 00:12:37.280\nDouble-clicking on the fill handle will\njust automatically do that for you.\n\n218\n00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:41.972\nAnd then it goes, boop, goes down to the\nlast entry within this range of contiguous\n\n219\n00:12:41.972 --> 00:12:44.000\ncells, and then there you go.\n\n220\n00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.180\nWonderful, pretty cool,\nnow we go ahead and concatenate.\n\n221\n00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.497\nLet's move on to text join,\nI like this one.\n\n222\n00:12:51.497 --> 00:12:54.895\nYou're gonna see the same\nresults in a different way, but\n\n223\n00:12:54.895 --> 00:12:57.600\nit gives you a little\nbit more flexibility.\n\n224\n00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.360\nWe already saw that we\nhad to add in that space\n\n225\n00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.620\nas part of the thing we\nneed to concatenate.\n\n226\n00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:09.110\nWith text join,\nyou go a little bit differently.\n\n227\n00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:15.210\nBecause those spaces that we added in\nhere, those are known as delimiters.\n\n228\n00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:17.626\nA delimiter, in anything,\n\n229\n00:13:17.626 --> 00:13:22.668\nis just some type of thing that\nis separating other things.\n\n230\n00:13:22.668 --> 00:13:28.960\n[LAUGH] So it's a delimiter character and\nspace is a specific character.\n\n231\n00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.490\nBut sometimes,\nmaybe like with this, I need it for\n\n232\n00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:37.430\nsome reason, that I need commas\nin between each one of these.\n\n233\n00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:41.400\nI don't just need a comma,\nI need a comma and a space to go ahead and\n\n234\n00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:45.690\nput in Alice Wonderpaws,\nHuman Resources, Green.\n\n235\n00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:47.740\nI need it all combined.\n\n236\n00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:51.512\nWell, this function will\nlet you pick the delimiter,\n\n237\n00:13:51.512 --> 00:13:56.764\nwill automatically put it in between\neach one of them, and then that's it.\n\n238\n00:13:56.764 --> 00:13:58.730\nIt's pretty cool,\nI see you're smiling over there.\n\n239\n00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:00.880\nYou do this in your programming\nlanguages too, don't you?\n\n240\n00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was sorry,\n\n241\n00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:04.450\nI just created these weird parallels.\n\n242\n00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:06.800\nI'm like well,\nthat would be this thing and that.\n\n243\n00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:07.740\nThis is how I do it.\n\n244\n00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.313\nSo I just got happy.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n245\n00:14:10.313 --> 00:14:11.316\n&gt;&gt; Nothing really to add to\n\n246\n00:14:11.316 --> 00:14:13.934\nthe conversation, though,\nother than I got happy about it.\n\n247\n00:14:13.934 --> 00:14:15.244\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I did the same thing in his\n\n248\n00:14:15.244 --> 00:14:15.752\nepisodes.\n\n249\n00:14:15.752 --> 00:14:16.693\nI'm over there going uh-huh.\n\n250\n00:14:16.693 --> 00:14:17.573\nAnd he's like you have a question?\n\n251\n00:14:17.573 --> 00:14:19.581\nI'm like no,\nI'm just making an observation so.\n\n252\n00:14:19.581 --> 00:14:21.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n253\n00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:22.467\n&gt;&gt; Let's go ahead and\n\n254\n00:14:22.467 --> 00:14:23.960\nshow you how to use this text join.\n\n255\n00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.430\nSo I have the cell that I want selected.\n\n256\n00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:31.120\nDefinitely go into the dialog box and\n\n257\n00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.529\nI will go TEXTJOIN,\nnew one and there it is.\n\n258\n00:14:35.529 --> 00:14:37.816\nOkay, we will click OK.\n\n259\n00:14:37.816 --> 00:14:40.170\nHere we go, we need a delimiter.\n\n260\n00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:43.230\nA character or\nstring to enter between each item.\n\n261\n00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:46.700\nI would like a comma and a space.\n\n262\n00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.960\nIgnore empty, this is kinda neat, okay?\n\n263\n00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.704\nWhat is it gonna do if it\nencounters an empty cell, okay?\n\n264\n00:14:54.704 --> 00:14:58.677\nAnd this is something when\nyou export out CSV files.\n\n265\n00:14:58.677 --> 00:15:02.290\nIf there's nothing in there,\nyou just get a whole bunch of commas and\n\n266\n00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:03.920\nit's like I don't need that.\n\n267\n00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:08.751\nSo you could actually tell it whether\nyou want to ignore empty cells or not.\n\n268\n00:15:08.751 --> 00:15:10.198\nWe're gonna go with true.\n\n269\n00:15:10.198 --> 00:15:12.895\nIt is default, it says you don't have to.\n\n270\n00:15:12.895 --> 00:15:14.410\nWe're gonna put it in there anyways.\n\n271\n00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.380\nThen, what is the first cell\nthat you would like to add?\n\n272\n00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:22.890\nI'm going to go with, let me zoom\nthat a little bit, I want Alice.\n\n273\n00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:30.414\nI'm going to specifically do it\nthis way first of saying I want A2,\n\n274\n00:15:30.414 --> 00:15:34.508\nthen B2, C2, Tab and D2, okay?\n\n275\n00:15:34.508 --> 00:15:38.630\nYeah, but that's just a range,\ncouldn't I just say like A2 through D2?\n\n276\n00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:43.176\nYou totally can, nothing wrong with that,\nI'll show you in a second.\n\n277\n00:15:43.176 --> 00:15:45.097\nThere's a reason why and\n\n278\n00:15:45.097 --> 00:15:49.958\nanother kind of advanced example\nof why I'm doing it this way.\n\n279\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:54.099\nAnd I can already see in the result,\nthat's where it's gonna be.\n\n280\n00:15:54.099 --> 00:15:57.097\nI click OK, I'm like man, that's cool.\n\n281\n00:15:57.097 --> 00:15:57.837\nI really like this.\n\n282\n00:15:57.837 --> 00:15:59.486\nThis kinda gets me excited.\n\n283\n00:15:59.486 --> 00:16:07.130\nThat's nice and you look at the syntax\nof the function not too terribly hard.\n\n284\n00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:12.210\nAnd now since I went to the dialogue box\nand understand that, this first thing and\n\n285\n00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:17.410\nbefore the first comma, or argument\nwithin the function is the delimiter.\n\n286\n00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:23.550\nI could come in here and maybe take out\nthat extra space and put like a slash.\n\n287\n00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:27.620\nAnd then it puts in\nthe slash as the delimiter.\n\n288\n00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:31.310\nI can come in here and\nput in three spaces.\n\n289\n00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:32.320\nWhat's in three spaces?\n\n290\n00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:36.210\nSo it's kinda neat that you\ncan have the same deliminator\n\n291\n00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:37.770\npopulated through everything.\n\n292\n00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:41.450\nAnd you can kind of pick and choose,\ncuz maybe you were doing file path.\n\n293\n00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.900\nI saw something with how you go ahead and\ndo file path with the flash.\n\n294\n00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:51.730\nThe comma space for any type of list\nitems really neat on how it does it.\n\n295\n00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:55.900\nAnd if I copy this down,\nthen it does it for all of it, and\n\n296\n00:16:55.900 --> 00:17:01.980\nsince we told it to not, the true for\nthe ignoring your blanks.\n\n297\n00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:07.370\nIf I took this one and deleted it out, and\ndeleted this one out, maybe even delete it\n\n298\n00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:13.330\nhere, you see how it doesn't give me extra\ncommas where there's an empty space.\n\n299\n00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:15.600\nThat right there is pretty neat as well.\n\n300\n00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:20.190\nBut if I had taken this and made to false,\n\n301\n00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:22.220\nlet me make sure I just\ntype in false right.\n\n302\n00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:26.130\nLet's just add all sorts of different,\nuppers and lowers.\n\n303\n00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:28.940\nAnd now you can see here,\nsince there's blanks,\n\n304\n00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:35.340\nit's gonna give me those extra commas,\nwhere there are missing entities, okay?\n\n305\n00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:38.880\nReasons why and why you might\nnot want those or why you would.\n\n306\n00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.160\nSo kinda neat that you could\ndo it right from that formula.\n\n307\n00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:47.205\nAnd like I said,\nI could have come into here and\n\n308\n00:17:47.205 --> 00:17:53.140\nsaid, all right, I don't wanna\ndo the each cell individually.\n\n309\n00:17:53.140 --> 00:18:00.100\nI want the range from A2 through D2,\ntotally fine as well.\n\n310\n00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:03.690\nLet's change that back to true,\ncuz I do like that.\n\n311\n00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:08.860\nAnd we'll hit enter, come back,\ndouble-click, fill it in, pretty cool.\n\n312\n00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:13.580\nSo, you can use a range,\nyou can use individual cells, and\n\n313\n00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:16.995\njust say this, this, this, or arrange.\n\n314\n00:18:16.995 --> 00:18:20.502\nPretty neat stuff that you\ncan do with text join, and\n\n315\n00:18:20.502 --> 00:18:25.273\nthat's a newer function within 2016.\n&gt;&gt; So before this we would have to use\n\n316\n00:18:25.273 --> 00:18:28.140\nconcatenate and\nkind of squish all those together.\n\n317\n00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:33.130\nThere wasn't something that was similar\nto text join, other than concatenate?\n\n318\n00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:35.505\n&gt;&gt; Not to my knowledge.\n\n319\n00:18:35.505 --> 00:18:38.085\n[LAUGH].\nI'm like, I don't think so.\n\n320\n00:18:38.085 --> 00:18:40.190\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, it makes sense,\n\n321\n00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:43.900\nbecause as I said, we allude to it.\n\n322\n00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:48.940\nI do things like this programmatically and\nI suspect that this came along\n\n323\n00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:53.430\nbecause people were like programmatically\ndoing this like using macros or\n\n324\n00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:55.660\nsomething or some extension.\n\n325\n00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:59.850\nAnd people are like, we do this so often,\nwhy isn't this just part of Excel?\n\n326\n00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:01.933\nI am totally hypothesizing about that.\n\n327\n00:19:01.933 --> 00:19:03.861\nI'm not saying that's the reasoning there.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n328\n00:19:03.861 --> 00:19:07.620\nI'm gonna go along with the hypothezation.\n\n329\n00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:08.478\n&gt;&gt; Hypothesis?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n330\n00:19:08.478 --> 00:19:09.970\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n331\n00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:10.690\n&gt;&gt; Because I feel like\n\n332\n00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:12.952\nthat's probably what they were doing too.\n\n333\n00:19:12.952 --> 00:19:18.680\nCould you have accomplished this before\ntext join with some type of VBA or\n\n334\n00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.610\nmore advanced programming?\n\n335\n00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:25.280\nYeah, probably, and then they just went\nahead and made it a little easier,\n\n336\n00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.110\nwhich is really, really cool.\n\n337\n00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:32.673\nCome back to that and making it easy,\nkeep that in mind, okay,\n\n338\n00:19:32.673 --> 00:19:36.020\ncuz there's flash fill which is so cool.\n\n339\n00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:40.830\nBut before I go on to that, I just\nwanted to show you a little bit more\n\n340\n00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:44.860\nadvanced version of this.\n\n341\n00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:50.710\nLike I have address, city,\nstate, zip, but I wanna have it\n\n342\n00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:55.880\nto where the Tampa and Florida has\na comma but everything else has a space.\n\n343\n00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.270\nBack in this other example,\nit was just like,\n\n344\n00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:01.260\nwell then if I put in my delimiter\nthen each one of them would\n\n345\n00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:05.390\nhave a comma between it, or\nevery one would have a space.\n\n346\n00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:06.980\nBut between these,\nI want something different.\n\n347\n00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:08.360\nAnd then the rest of it, I want spaces.\n\n348\n00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:14.100\nSo this is just an example of a nested\nstatement or nested function, right?\n\n349\n00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:19.547\nSo remember back to where we said,\nI want to add in A,\n\n350\n00:20:19.547 --> 00:20:24.590\nB, C, D, one, two, three, four.\n\n351\n00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:28.130\nWell, what this is is add this one cell.\n\n352\n00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:32.660\nThis right here,\nyou can consider that like another piece.\n\n353\n00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.750\nAnd if you look at it, what is it doing?\n\n354\n00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:40.140\nIt's just saying, well, text join this,\nthis, but then this one in parenthesis,\n\n355\n00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:42.880\njoin with a comma and\n\n356\n00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:48.150\na space between B2 and C2,\nbetween Tampa and Florida.\n\n357\n00:20:49.245 --> 00:20:53.140\nThen take this out if it has blanks.\n\n358\n00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:54.730\nThat is all one piece, okay?\n\n359\n00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.330\nAnd then put in D2 for the last entry.\n\n360\n00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:04.050\nSo you can get pretty creative without\ngoing too crazy with the syntax.\n\n361\n00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:07.820\nThis looks scary, the biggest thing\nyou gotta remember when you do nested\n\n362\n00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.920\nstatements or nested functions\nis making sure your parenthesis,\n\n363\n00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:14.300\nbecause there's one, two here.\n\n364\n00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:20.310\nThis text joined by itself,\nokay, that is one function.\n\n365\n00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:24.480\nThese are the arguments of text join.\n\n366\n00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.610\nAnd then all of that, and\nthey color code it nicely.\n\n367\n00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:30.240\nThe red is saying this is all one piece,\n\n368\n00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:34.545\nthat is part of the bigger text join,\nokay?\n\n369\n00:21:34.545 --> 00:21:39.340\nSo I have episodes that\n\n370\n00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:42.840\nspecifically just kinda get a little\nbit more into nested functions.\n\n371\n00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:47.680\nBut this is one example of it, and just\nmake sure you don't put an equals here.\n\n372\n00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:50.980\nThere's only one equals, okay,\nit's performing the function for\n\n373\n00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:52.190\nthe whole thing.\n\n374\n00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:57.940\nSo that's just an example of how I could\ntake something like that, put a comma\n\n375\n00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:03.610\nin between city and state, and then spaces\nin the rest using the text join function.\n\n376\n00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:06.540\nAgain, pretty cool, I like that.\n\n377\n00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:11.380\nAll right, but,\n[LAUGH] there's flash fill.\n\n378\n00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:14.920\nFlash fill is still one of those\nturn it around and make it easy,\n\n379\n00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:17.210\nlike we do this all day long.\n\n380\n00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:22.450\nSo why don't we just program\nthe application to do it.\n\n381\n00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:24.372\nAt the time it's recording,\n\n382\n00:22:24.372 --> 00:22:29.330\nflash fill is only a PC functionality,\nit does not work in Mac, I'm sorry.\n\n383\n00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:35.064\nI really hope that they extend\nthat out to Mac versions, but\n\n384\n00:22:35.064 --> 00:22:39.661\nat this time I don't know if,\nor when, they will do that.\n\n385\n00:22:39.661 --> 00:22:47.236\nSo, here we go, if I take Alice, I wanna\ndo Alice, Kimba, Wonder paws, okay?\n\n386\n00:22:47.236 --> 00:22:50.900\nI start typing in this,\nnow this is continuous range of cells.\n\n387\n00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:56.263\nSo I type Alice, Kimba, Wonder paws,\n\n388\n00:22:56.263 --> 00:23:00.300\nEnter, straight text.\n\n389\n00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:01.910\nI start typing the next one.\n\n390\n00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:08.070\nDo you see how it automatically\nfound the pattern\n\n391\n00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:13.100\nthat I had typed in, in that cell above,\nlooked at all the stuff next to it?\n\n392\n00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:16.820\nIt saw like, you just put spaces\nin between every one of them.\n\n393\n00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:20.750\nWhen you go down to the next one, I'm\nsmart enough that I'm gonna look at that\n\n394\n00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:23.640\nfield and say, you want to do the rest\nof them like that, don't you?\n\n395\n00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:27.019\nYou just hit enter and then, there you go.\n\n396\n00:23:27.019 --> 00:23:29.815\n[LAUGH] That's pretty neat, right?\n&gt;&gt; I will tell you,\n\n397\n00:23:29.815 --> 00:23:32.990\nVonne, that seems like a whole\nbunch of cheating right there.\n\n398\n00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:34.800\nYou didn't even have to do anything.\n\n399\n00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.980\nIt's like, well here's the pattern,\nhere's what we think.\n\n400\n00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:40.380\nNow, we say this is helpful, but\nthere's other times we complain about\n\n401\n00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.680\nthings being too helpful and\nmaking assumptions.\n\n402\n00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:45.890\nSo this I think this is\na pretty good feature.\n\n403\n00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:48.970\nBut I could see where sometimes you're\nlike, no, that's not what I want.\n\n404\n00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:51.312\nI just wanted this first row doing that.\n\n405\n00:23:51.312 --> 00:23:53.323\nSo you would just have to\nbe aware of those things.\n\n406\n00:23:53.323 --> 00:23:56.226\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and then also how is going to,\n\n407\n00:23:56.226 --> 00:24:00.815\nwhat if I have Nothing here,\nand I have nothing there, and\n\n408\n00:24:00.815 --> 00:24:03.167\nI have a couple extra things.\n\n409\n00:24:03.167 --> 00:24:09.372\nSo if I start typing in,\nI think I have to start, bell.\n\n410\n00:24:09.372 --> 00:24:11.330\nOkay, see I had to do the first one.\n\n411\n00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:15.368\nOkay, so let's go back into here and\nlet's see if I can trick and be like yes,\n\n412\n00:24:15.368 --> 00:24:16.189\nwander pause.\n\n413\n00:24:16.189 --> 00:24:18.024\nI spaced and then deleted.\n\n414\n00:24:18.024 --> 00:24:21.863\nAnd now, if I start typing in bell, okay.\n\n415\n00:24:21.863 --> 00:24:24.829\nWell, now I gotta do the whole\nthing over again and so\n\n416\n00:24:24.829 --> 00:24:27.398\nmaybe it's gray at the first time,\nbut yes.\n\n417\n00:24:27.398 --> 00:24:30.290\nWhat I'm trying to get at,\nI have a whole episode about flash fill.\n\n418\n00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:31.690\nSo definitely go back,\n\n419\n00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:36.100\ncuz I don't wanna fill in this episode\nwith only talk about flash fill, but\n\n420\n00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:40.932\nthose nuances of what it does with some\nblank cells, what if there's extra text?\n\n421\n00:24:40.932 --> 00:24:43.671\nIt can get a little,\nyeah, it's helpful and\n\n422\n00:24:43.671 --> 00:24:47.509\nit's doing it automatically, but\nit didn't know how to do this,\n\n423\n00:24:47.509 --> 00:24:51.434\nand it's giving you some wonky\nresults of what I didn't want to do.\n\n424\n00:24:51.434 --> 00:24:55.473\nWhen you have a function like this,\nit's a function.\n\n425\n00:24:55.473 --> 00:24:59.475\nSo, just kinda keep that in mind.\n\n426\n00:24:59.475 --> 00:25:01.534\nAnd, the other thing about here,\n\n427\n00:25:01.534 --> 00:25:06.023\nif I did, the cool thing about patterns,\nit doesn't have to go straight.\n\n428\n00:25:06.023 --> 00:25:12.521\nIf I did wonder pause, comma, space,\nAlice, and then I start typing\n\n429\n00:25:12.521 --> 00:25:17.497\nin darling are you gonna break on me?\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well anyway,\n\n430\n00:25:17.497 --> 00:25:20.775\n[LAUGH] it should automatically\ngo ahead and find that pattern.\n\n431\n00:25:20.775 --> 00:25:24.434\nI'm wondering if I just kind of,\nI kinda knocked it out of rotation and\n\n432\n00:25:24.434 --> 00:25:25.806\nit doesn't understand.\n\n433\n00:25:25.806 --> 00:25:29.677\nSo I kinda would probably go back and\nundo and redo.\n\n434\n00:25:29.677 --> 00:25:32.993\nIt will find it though, and it will work.\n\n435\n00:25:32.993 --> 00:25:36.128\nSince this is not a flash fill episode,\nbut I'm just gonna go dude,\n\n436\n00:25:36.128 --> 00:25:38.888\ngo check the other one out,\ncuz I do this exact same sample.\n\n437\n00:25:38.888 --> 00:25:42.231\nBut I do wanna make a big point on here,\n\n438\n00:25:42.231 --> 00:25:46.795\nwhen I type in one you see what happened?\n&gt;&gt; You misspelled\n\n439\n00:25:46.795 --> 00:25:47.562\nwonderful.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n440\n00:25:47.562 --> 00:25:49.880\nthat's probably why it doesn't like it.\n\n441\n00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.751\nSo let's try it one more time.\n\n442\n00:25:51.751 --> 00:25:54.042\nJust so I can do it.\n\n443\n00:25:54.042 --> 00:25:55.577\nAnd we've got a couple minutes left,\nright?\n\n444\n00:25:55.577 --> 00:25:59.564\nSo if I start typing in,\nthere we go, thank you.\n\n445\n00:25:59.564 --> 00:26:04.324\nSee, it didn't understand how to\nfigure out what's going on with\n\n446\n00:26:04.324 --> 00:26:06.279\nthe missing information.\n\n447\n00:26:06.279 --> 00:26:10.269\nBut it actually almost worked\njust like the text join.\n\n448\n00:26:10.269 --> 00:26:12.795\nBack to my point of where\nI was trying to get to.\n\n449\n00:26:12.795 --> 00:26:14.840\nThis is just straight text, isn't it?\n\n450\n00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:17.885\nThis is not a result of a function.\n\n451\n00:26:17.885 --> 00:26:22.311\nIf I came over here and tried to copy and\npaste this to another worksheet or\n\n452\n00:26:22.311 --> 00:26:24.791\nanother place, it's gonna go, nope.\n\n453\n00:26:24.791 --> 00:26:28.098\nI don't understand,\ncuz I'm copying the function.\n\n454\n00:26:28.098 --> 00:26:31.801\nSo this is that same thing that\nwe do in quite a few episodes,\n\n455\n00:26:31.801 --> 00:26:36.468\nis that if I want this to be straight\ntext again, like actual information,\n\n456\n00:26:36.468 --> 00:26:38.338\nyou copy and paste as values.\n\n457\n00:26:38.338 --> 00:26:42.718\nWhether you copy and paste in place,\ndo that fun trick that I like to do,\n\n458\n00:26:42.718 --> 00:26:46.237\nwhich is the right-click drag and\nthen drag it over one.\n\n459\n00:26:46.237 --> 00:26:50.141\nI could even drag it over to the left cuz\nI haven't let go of the right-click on\n\n460\n00:26:50.141 --> 00:26:50.695\nmy mouse.\n\n461\n00:26:50.695 --> 00:26:51.971\nThen move it back.\n\n462\n00:26:51.971 --> 00:26:56.369\nIf given the option of copy here with\nvalues and now this is straight text.\n\n463\n00:26:56.369 --> 00:26:59.072\nSo that's something you\nhave to do with any,\n\n464\n00:26:59.072 --> 00:27:03.769\nany function that you do whether it's\nwith numbers or with text if I don't want\n\n465\n00:27:03.769 --> 00:27:07.344\nto be in its function form you've\ngot to paste it as values.\n\n466\n00:27:07.344 --> 00:27:12.394\nWhether you paste it in some other places\nvalues, paste it in places values but\n\n467\n00:27:12.394 --> 00:27:16.615\nyou gotta paste it as values,\notherwise it's still a function.\n\n468\n00:27:16.615 --> 00:27:20.235\nSo again, repeated throughout\nquite a few of these episodes.\n\n469\n00:27:20.235 --> 00:27:21.719\nSo if you're like, I've heard this before.\n\n470\n00:27:21.719 --> 00:27:22.909\nYeah, you're right.\n\n471\n00:27:22.909 --> 00:27:26.406\nBut the flash fill, it isn't a function.\n\n472\n00:27:26.406 --> 00:27:27.962\nIt's just going to do it.\n\n473\n00:27:27.962 --> 00:27:32.746\nSo lots of different examples\non how you can join text.\n\n474\n00:27:32.746 --> 00:27:37.454\nReally kind of focusing on the concat and\ntext join, thus the title of the episode.\n\n475\n00:27:37.454 --> 00:27:42.382\nBut some other ones along the way in\ncase you wanted to know the alternative\n\n476\n00:27:42.382 --> 00:27:44.583\nways of doing it.\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne, those are,\n\n477\n00:27:44.583 --> 00:27:45.545\nthose definitely handy.\n\n478\n00:27:45.545 --> 00:27:49.895\nI use things similar to that and\nmy explorations as well.\n\n479\n00:27:49.895 --> 00:27:53.346\nThat flash fill, I don't know,\nI feel like eventually I would be,\n\n480\n00:27:53.346 --> 00:27:56.333\nthis is non-deterministic,\nI'm gonna have a problem.\n\n481\n00:27:56.333 --> 00:28:00.237\nBut, it's PC only, so I don't have\nto worry about it at current time.\n\n482\n00:28:00.237 --> 00:28:03.412\nBut any final parting words of wisdom\nbefore we get out of here, Vonne?\n\n483\n00:28:03.412 --> 00:28:04.438\n&gt;&gt; It just sounds like you have some\n\n484\n00:28:04.438 --> 00:28:04.938\ntrust issues.\n\n485\n00:28:04.938 --> 00:28:06.822\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well you know what,\n\n486\n00:28:06.822 --> 00:28:09.273\nI don't think we have time to\ntalk about my personal life.\n\n487\n00:28:09.273 --> 00:28:12.254\nSo we're gonna go ahead and get out of\nhere, so signing off for Office PRO.TV,\n\n488\n00:28:12.254 --> 00:28:14.527\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n489\n00:28:14.527 --> 00:28:16.077\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n490\n00:28:16.077 --> 00:28:19.881\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

OfficePro.tv.\n\n3\n00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.448\nI'm your host Justin Dennison,\nand woo, let me tell you what,\n\n4\n00:00:18.448 --> 00:00:22.170\nwe got more Excel functions coming\nright at you, just for you.\n\n5\n00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.400\nYeah, you right there.\n\n6\n00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.680\nAnd in particular we're gonna be\ntalking about left, right and mid.\n\n7\n00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.760\nThose are my left and right hands,\nthey're probably reversed for you.\n\n8\n00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.610\nBut luckily we have someone who's\nnot gonna get us all twisted.\n\n9\n00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.660\nAnd let us know what left,\nright and mid actually does.\n\n10\n00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.830\nThe one and only, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n11\n00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:38.560\nHow are you today, Vonne?\n\n12\n00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.600\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing pretty good.\n\n13\n00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.960\nI'm feeling a little pressure that I'm\ngonna keep you all from being twisted.\n\n14\n00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.060\n&gt;&gt; Well, you know, I don't know.\n\n15\n00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.070\nI will tell you,\nI'm big on over promise and under deliver.\n\n16\n00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.970\nSo that's how we roll on my shows.\n\n17\n00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:50.661\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n18\n00:00:50.661 --> 00:00:54.203\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, these are actually functions that\n\n19\n00:00:54.203 --> 00:00:59.582\nI know you are familiar with because I\nhost on some of your Dev Pro TV shows.\n\n20\n00:00:59.582 --> 00:01:05.330\nAnd we've talked about strings of text\nencoding in programming languages.\n\n21\n00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.260\nAnd how we want to get some off the front,\nget some off the back and\n\n22\n00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.670\nthen find out what's in the middle.\n\n23\n00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.060\nAnd that's exactly what\nwe're going to be doing.\n\n24\n00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.680\nSo this is a text function or\n\n25\n00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.620\ntext functions that we can\ndo with strings of text.\n\n26\n00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.940\nSo to try and just make this a little more\ninteresting because I could probably show\n\n27\n00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.650\nyou these things in 30 seconds and\nbe like, done.\n\n28\n00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.870\nBut that's not how we roll here at Office\nPro TV so we're going to mix a couple\n\n29\n00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.870\nof my favorite things in this episode and\nwe're going to have a little bit of fun.\n\n30\n00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.580\nSo why don't we go ahead and\nget started I have my desktop and just for\n\n31\n00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.530\nfun, cattywampus.\n\n32\n00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.160\nYes, [LAUGH] I just wanted to find\nsome random fun word to go ahead.\n\n33\n00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.170\nAnd start our example of what\nthis is actually going to do for\n\n34\n00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.060\nus in functionality.\n\n35\n00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.210\nBut do you what cattywampus means there,\nJustin?\n\n36\n00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.260\n&gt;&gt; This is actually a word?\n\n37\n00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.629\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I thought you totally made it up.\n\n38\n00:01:59.629 --> 00:02:01.668\n&gt;&gt; No\n&gt;&gt; Nope,I don't know what it means that\n\n39\n00:02:01.668 --> 00:02:03.710\n[LAUGH] I thought it was a Vonne word.\n\n40\n00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.110\n&gt;&gt; No, I like were you're going because I\nprobably would say something like this.\n\n41\n00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.480\nBut no this is an actual\nterm that you will find and\n\n42\n00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.835\nit was first something that\nis in disarray, or askew.\n\n43\n00:02:15.835 --> 00:02:18.665\nOr something that is not directly\nacross from something else,\n\n44\n00:02:18.665 --> 00:02:21.595\nkind of like how we use catty corner,\nright?\n\n45\n00:02:21.595 --> 00:02:25.275\nThe library is catty\ncorner from the town hall.\n\n46\n00:02:25.275 --> 00:02:27.125\nJeff is over here, okay, yeah.\n\n47\n00:02:27.125 --> 00:02:29.155\nSo it has a double meaning, okay.\n\n48\n00:02:29.155 --> 00:02:32.750\nIt's not exactly next to each other,\nor I mean,\n\n49\n00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.740\nif you threw a bunch of papers on my desk,\nmy desk would be very cattywampus.\n\n50\n00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.610\n&gt;&gt; So I'll tell you what.\n\n51\n00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.940\nA lot of people watching are probably\ngoing, I've never used any of those terms\n\n52\n00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.670\nbefore, cattywampus,\ncattycorner, [LAUGH] adjacent.\n\n53\n00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.570\nThat's all right.\n\n54\n00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:49.590\nWe're from the south.\n\n55\n00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.600\nSo that's how [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n56\n00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.520\nit is a term you'll find in the midland\nand southern United States.\n\n57\n00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.670\nSo I've used CATTY\ncorner quite frequently.\n\n58\n00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.410\nI don't know how frequently but I was.\n\n59\n00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.429\nAnd it had cat in there.\n\n60\n00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:04.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so that made me happy.\n\n61\n00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.660\nSo if I were to ask you to so\nI'm gonna put you on the spot.\n\n62\n00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.190\nAre you ready?\n\n63\n00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.830\nAll right.\n\n64\n00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.792\nWhat would be,\ntell me what the first three letters are.\n\n65\n00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:12.807\n&gt;&gt; C-A-T.\n\n66\n00:03:12.807 --> 00:03:13.680\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n67\n00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.180\nSo that would be on what side of the word?\n\n68\n00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.910\n&gt;&gt; The left.\n\n69\n00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.452\n&gt;&gt; Give me the last five letters\n&gt;&gt; A-M-P-U-S.\n\n70\n00:03:19.452 --> 00:03:20.300\n&gt;&gt; Um-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Ampus.\n\n71\n00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.410\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; Ampus.\n\n72\n00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.420\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because\n\n73\n00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.820\nthat's on the-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n74\n00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:24.440\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n75\n00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.920\nOK.\nGive me the middle letters, but\n\n76\n00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.140\nI want you to start at\nthe fifth character.\n\n77\n00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.890\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n78\n00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.130\n&gt;&gt; Or\nafter the fifth character I should say.\n\n79\n00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.110\n&gt;&gt; So the middle letters?\n\n80\n00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.090\nI'm guessing-\n&gt;&gt; Wait, let me clarify.\n\n81\n00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.841\nGive me the three middle letters\nstarting after character five.\n\n82\n00:03:41.841 --> 00:03:42.870\n&gt;&gt; Okay, after character five.\n\n83\n00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:46.780\nMan, that one's hard.\n\n84\n00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.840\nI'm going to go with A, M, P?\n\n85\n00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.780\nOr WAMP.\n\n86\n00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:51.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n87\n00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.780\nOne, two, three, four, five.\n\n88\n00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.540\nSo CATTY is five.\n\n89\n00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.990\nSo after five would be\nthe sixth character.\n\n90\n00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.041\nYou're probably doing too much\nplottting stuff over those.\n\n91\n00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:04.310\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I am way overthinking this.\n\n92\n00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.230\nI was like the middle.\n\n93\n00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.420\nSo I'm gonna cut these off.\n\n94\n00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.600\nI'm gonna go to the middle\nof that word and find those.\n\n95\n00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.160\nBut I'm guessing t middle or\n\n96\n00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.780\nmid has a little bit different meaning,\nwhen I guess on how you tweak it.\n\n97\n00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.989\n&gt;&gt; You would have to say, where do you\nneed a count from, because if I decide\n\n98\n00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.616\nthe middle, that's gonna be variable like\nI want you to start five letters in.\n\n99\n00:04:24.616 --> 00:04:28.746\nAnd letters are starting at one in Excel\ncuz I know the whole zero index and\n\n100\n00:04:28.746 --> 00:04:30.660\nit's a programming thing.\n\n101\n00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:31.860\nCheck out DevPro TV.\n\n102\n00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.960\nSo this is one two three four five.\n\n103\n00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.010\nNot zero one to three four.\n\n104\n00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.310\nAnyways you have to determine\nwhere you wanna start and\n\n105\n00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.020\nthen how many characters\nyou want it to return.\n\n106\n00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.140\nAnd that's what the functions\nare going to do for us, okay.\n\n107\n00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.990\nNow I'm keeping this very simple\n&gt;&gt; Just to\n\n108\n00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.505\ndemonstrate what these particular\nfunctions are going to do.\n\n109\n00:04:55.505 --> 00:04:58.840\nBecause this is going to be an example\nthat everything is very uniform.\n\n110\n00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.880\nSo we're going to come over\nhere to cat toys, okay.\n\n111\n00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.450\nSo let's say we have item codes for\nour different cat toys.\n\n112\n00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.680\nAnd we are creating cat toys in different\n\n113\n00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.060\nhockey teams that we're selling\nat our lightning store.\n\n114\n00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.150\nSo we can play with all of our enemies and\nopponents\n\n115\n00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.110\nin the Stanley Cup Final and say no we\ndon't like these Pittsburgh Penguins.\n\n116\n00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.170\nAnd we're gonna have them different colors\nso our cats can go ahead and destroy them.\n\n117\n00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:33.112\nAnd make us feel better about look at\nmy cats destroying the [INAUDIBLE],\n\n118\n00:05:33.112 --> 00:05:33.860\nso anyways.\n\n119\n00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:34.810\n&gt;&gt; Well I tell you what Vonne,\n\n120\n00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.580\nthere seems to be some pent up rage\n[LAUGH] or descent or something there.\n\n121\n00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.770\nBut maybe we shouldn't go down\nthat corridor specifically.\n\n122\n00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.730\n&gt;&gt; Well I'm mixing my two favorite things,\n&gt;&gt; Cats and hockey.\n\n123\n00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.160\nAnd right now,\nat the time of this recording,\n\n124\n00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.550\nwe're in the middle of\nthe Stanley Cup finals.\n\n125\n00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.300\nAnd I'm just gonna call it now,\nLightning all the way.\n\n126\n00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.050\nAnyway, so we're gonna go ahead.\n\n127\n00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.310\nI need something from this.\n\n128\n00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.680\nBecause let's say that\nthe first couple letters.\n\n129\n00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.740\nThe first three.\n\n130\n00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.658\nIn our item code, indicates the team okay?\n\n131\n00:06:04.658 --> 00:06:06.600\nLike PIT is Pittsburgh.\n\n132\n00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:12.010\nVGK, it's a Vegas Golden Knights,\nit's a brand new team.\n\n133\n00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.210\nAnd the middle two are going to be,\ncuz I made this all up by the way.\n\n134\n00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.550\nSo those are gonna be our animals.\n\n135\n00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.940\n10 is a bird, 11 is a mouse,\n12 is a lizard, 13 is a dog.\n\n136\n00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.050\nCuz we want our cats to destroy our dogs.\n\n137\n00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:26.086\nThis is getting really dark.\n\n138\n00:06:26.086 --> 00:06:27.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n139\n00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.690\nthen the last two are the colors,\nlike blue, white and black.\n\n140\n00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.350\nBecause those are lightening colors.\n\n141\n00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.210\nBecause maybe I need to be\nable to take these item codes.\n\n142\n00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:42.231\nAnd take out parts of it because I want\nto see how many animals do I have?\n\n143\n00:06:42.231 --> 00:06:44.125\nHow many different colors do I have?\n\n144\n00:06:44.125 --> 00:06:46.290\nBecause I want to be\nable to pull that out.\n\n145\n00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.795\nSo this is somewhat of a common\nthing that you might need to do.\n\n146\n00:06:48.795 --> 00:06:53.520\nInstead of concatenating information\ntogether, meaning join it together,\n\n147\n00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.050\nI need to break it part.\n\n148\n00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:56.024\nI need pieces out of it.\n\n149\n00:06:56.024 --> 00:06:59.340\nNow again, keeping simple,\nthese are all uniform.\n\n150\n00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.370\nThey all have three, then a dash,\nthen two, then a dash, then three.\n\n151\n00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:05.590\nSo this, that's great.\n\n152\n00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:11.400\nWhat if they circuit a null variable and\nI just, that not saying it's not possible.\n\n153\n00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:17.170\nIt's just a little bit more advanced and\ninvolves multiple message functions.\n\n154\n00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.450\nOkay so yes you can do it if\nyou're already thinking that,\n\n155\n00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:21.490\njust not in this episode.\n\n156\n00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.390\nLet's just get the basic concept\nof what these functions do.\n\n157\n00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:27.250\nLet's get the team.\n\n158\n00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.290\nLet's get the first three\ncharacters from the left.\n\n159\n00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:33.061\nSo we're gonna type this one out because\nit's not too terribly difficult.\n\n160\n00:07:33.061 --> 00:07:35.610\nWe're going to say equals.\n\n161\n00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:38.090\nWe're going to say left because\nthat is the function name.\n\n162\n00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.610\nWe're gonna open the parentheses.\n\n163\n00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.990\nWhat is the cell that I'm trying\nto get the left characters\n\n164\n00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:47.720\nout of is this particular cell.\n\n165\n00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.910\nThen, how many characters do I want?\n\n166\n00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:52.960\nMake sure the comma in there, okay.\n\n167\n00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:57.880\nI want three and\nthen we close the parenthesis.\n\n168\n00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.813\nAnd then, there you go,\nthat's what we got.\n\n169\n00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:02.999\nAnd just to show you in\nthe insert function dialog box,\n\n170\n00:08:02.999 --> 00:08:08.330\nit just kinda gives you the option of like\nwhat is this string that I'm looking at.\n\n171\n00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.510\nAnd then give me the number of characters.\n\n172\n00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:14.950\nSpecify how many characters\nyou want the LEFT to extract.\n\n173\n00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:17.610\nSo just showing you what it shows.\n\n174\n00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:20.130\nAnd then we want to copy it down.\n\n175\n00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:20.910\nAnd then there you go.\n\n176\n00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:24.150\nSo now I've pulled out the first\nthree characters for all of these.\n\n177\n00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:26.860\nThink you got the same idea for\n\n178\n00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:31.780\nlet's go over here to color, the right's\na little easier, let's say equal right,\n\n179\n00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:37.690\noops right open, this is the cell\nthat I wanna look at comma,\n\n180\n00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:44.195\nthe last three characters\nthen it brings out blu great.\n\n181\n00:08:44.195 --> 00:08:49.010\nDouble-click, fill it down,\ngets out the last three characters.\n\n182\n00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:54.420\nNow, the mid is just like I explained\nwhen I was asking about Catty right?\n\n183\n00:08:54.420 --> 00:09:00.470\nI had to tell you how many characters\nin to start back to the specific\n\n184\n00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:04.480\nmiddle place that I want and then how\nmany characters I want you to extract.\n\n185\n00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:09.720\nSo those are multiple arguments that you\nhave to put in with your mid function.\n\n186\n00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.910\nSo I'm going to, let's go to the dot\ndialog box, make it a little easier.\n\n187\n00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:22.020\nIs in there in our text categories and\nwe will find mid and we will click okay.\n\n188\n00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.325\nAnd so let's go ahead and\nfind the cell that I want to evaluate\n\n189\n00:09:25.325 --> 00:09:30.950\nStart_num is the position of the first\ncharacter that you want to extract.\n\n190\n00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:38.025\nSo I would like to extract the one,\ntwo, three, four, okay?\n\n191\n00:09:38.025 --> 00:09:41.630\nBecause I need to make sure\nthat I include that dash.\n\n192\n00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:45.790\nAnd then the number of\ncharacters are two and\n\n193\n00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:52.210\nI just realized I messed that up,\nwait, I need a start at five.\n\n194\n00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:52.760\nThere we go.\n\n195\n00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.780\nCuz looking at this I want to\nextract the numbers one and two.\n\n196\n00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:01.030\nSo start at five,\nI'm doing some crazy coding aren't I?\n\n197\n00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:04.140\nYeah, which actually backwards, but\nanyway we're gonna go ahead and\n\n198\n00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:08.300\nsay I want the number of characters\nstarting at five, give me two.\n\n199\n00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.040\nThat is what I'd like to extract.\n\n200\n00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:14.240\nWe click OK and then we copy it down.\n\n201\n00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:20.970\nSo that's how we could our left and\nour right and our mid by themselves.\n\n202\n00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:23.550\nThis is still text, isn't it?\n\n203\n00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:27.880\nNo, this is still function and\nit not a number or\n\n204\n00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:31.540\nnot a text that I need to then copy and\npaste.\n\n205\n00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.980\nSame thing we do with\na lot of these functions.\n\n206\n00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:39.950\nSo if I wanted this to stay as\ntext you would have to go ahead.\n\n207\n00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:46.390\nAnd do the copy and paste either into\nanother worksheet and paste as values.\n\n208\n00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:53.360\nOr do the copy and then paste in place and\nsay I only want the values and\n\n209\n00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:58.600\nnow the cell contents is blu,\nwhi and so on and so forth.\n\n210\n00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:05.500\nIt is not the result of a function, and\nnow I can use it as its data itself.\n\n211\n00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:10.440\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Vonne, that mid is kind\nof like the left, but I have an offset.\n\n212\n00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:14.200\nSo mid is left with an offset,\nthat's not how I was thinking about it.\n\n213\n00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.990\nI was thinking like when you say mid,\ngive me the middle three characters,\n\n214\n00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:18.410\nlike there was a bunch of magic.\n\n215\n00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:20.640\nThis actually makes a lot more sense now.\n\n216\n00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.490\nHave some kind of offset.\n\n217\n00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:26.830\nI'm gonna start at that offset and\nthen grab some n number of characters.\n\n218\n00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:30.410\nAnd that just allows me to go you're going\nto the middle of the word to do this.\n\n219\n00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:35.320\nI'm guessing that mid could reproduce\nboth left and right by itself.\n\n220\n00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.470\nAm I correct in that?\n\n221\n00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:40.400\nLike if I put mid zero, right.\n\n222\n00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.700\nSo A to zero and then give me three.\n\n223\n00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:44.825\n&gt;&gt; A to 0.\n\n224\n00:11:44.825 --> 00:11:48.300\n&gt;&gt; And then give me 3, or\n1, excuse me, maybe it's 1.\n\n225\n00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:49.393\nLet's try in one.\n\n226\n00:11:49.393 --> 00:11:50.094\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n227\n00:11:50.094 --> 00:11:54.420\n&gt;&gt; So, give me 3 characters\nstarting with 1, sorry [INAUDIBLE]\n\n228\n00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:55.090\n&gt;&gt; Start at 1.\n\n229\n00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:55.960\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n230\n00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.649\n&gt;&gt; Give me 3, yes,\nthat's the exact same thing as left.\n\n231\n00:12:00.649 --> 00:12:01.360\n&gt;&gt; Got you.\n\n232\n00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.240\n&gt;&gt; Because it,\none is our starting character.\n\n233\n00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:09.140\nSo that way and it is always from\nthe left that the mid starts because\n\n234\n00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:12.940\nwe're just going right to\nleft in this particular case.\n\n235\n00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:16.500\n&gt;&gt; What happens if you put a negative\nnumber in there for the starting position?\n\n236\n00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:17.142\n&gt;&gt; Let's try it.\n\n237\n00:12:17.142 --> 00:12:21.703\nIt says [LAUGH].\n\n238\n00:12:21.703 --> 00:12:26.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay I have some hopeful,\nI had my figures crossed over that one.\n\n239\n00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:27.559\nBut it doesn't work.\n\n240\n00:12:27.559 --> 00:12:31.320\n&gt;&gt; No, you're getting too\nmuch in your cody brain.\n\n241\n00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.590\nYeah [LAUGH] because I remember\nsome episodes with you that you\n\n242\n00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:36.070\ndo some negatives and do some values.\n\n243\n00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:38.740\nBut now it doesn't work exactly like that.\n\n244\n00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:43.271\nSo yeah we can't have negative, so\nwe would say start at 5 and go through 3,\n\n245\n00:12:43.271 --> 00:12:47.475\nno we want it 2, okay,\nthat's what we wanted, all right, perfect.\n\n246\n00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:51.900\nSo, but that is how these particular\nfunctions work, you do have to copy and\n\n247\n00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:57.370\npaste, to make sure that you are getting\njust the values and not the function.\n\n248\n00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:00.140\nAnd coming back around to some of\n\n249\n00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:03.660\nthese episodes where we're\ngoing back to the flash fill.\n\n250\n00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.080\nMan, I love this stuff.\n\n251\n00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.368\nThe flash fill,\nwe did this in the concatenate, right?\n\n252\n00:13:08.368 --> 00:13:12.340\nYou can use it to extract as well.\n\n253\n00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:15.420\nSo if I come into here,\nif you want more flash fill episodes,\n\n254\n00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:21.110\ndefinitely check out the Excel Essential\nseries, at this time we're recording,\n\n255\n00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:25.300\nonly APC functionality,\nsorry MAC users, I know.\n\n256\n00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:32.670\nSo if I typed in give me PIT, hit enter,\nas soon as I started typing in V.\n\n257\n00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:37.500\nDo you see how it says I see what you\ntyped in, I'm looking over next door,\n\n258\n00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:41.461\nI see that, just hit enter and\nit goes ahead and does it.\n\n259\n00:13:41.461 --> 00:13:45.795\n[LAUGH] Every time I do flash field,\nJustin's face just goes, ugh.\n\n260\n00:13:45.795 --> 00:13:50.860\n[LAUGH] And I think you have to do it more\nthan, no the first time it went away,\n\n261\n00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:51.738\nso lets try it again.\n\n262\n00:13:51.738 --> 00:13:59.010\nLet's do 13, this happened last time,\nwhen I was testing this out.\n\n263\n00:13:59.010 --> 00:13:59.992\nI had it that one time.\n\n264\n00:14:02.224 --> 00:14:04.785\nThere we go.\nI had to get it right away to make sure\n\n265\n00:14:04.785 --> 00:14:07.290\nthat yep, it found it and pull that out.\n\n266\n00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:11.990\nAnd I think you get the idea if I type it\nin and then, yep, that's what I want and\n\n267\n00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:13.620\nit'll pull it out.\n\n268\n00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:17.995\nYou saw it happen.\n\n269\n00:14:17.995 --> 00:14:18.510\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n\n270\n00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:19.221\n&gt;&gt; I went too fast.\n\n271\n00:14:19.221 --> 00:14:20.530\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And this is one of those things,\n\n272\n00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:21.900\nthis is why my face contorts.\n\n273\n00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:25.130\nBecause I can see you getting\nin the rhythm of things and\n\n274\n00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:28.790\nusing this a great deal and\nthen something like this happens.\n\n275\n00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:33.830\nWhich is, it's just one of those nuance\nbehaviors where you're like, well it does.\n\n276\n00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:38.070\nIt's like following a specific\nlike regular expression or\n\n277\n00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:40.960\nlike a pattern and\nthen you don't catch it in time.\n\n278\n00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:41.920\nLike you saw all the numbers.\n\n279\n00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And then now you're spending time like\n\n280\n00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:46.052\ntry to figuring out how to make it work.\n\n281\n00:14:46.052 --> 00:14:46.601\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; So-\n\n282\n00:14:46.601 --> 00:14:48.290\n&gt;&gt; When I couldn't use the function.\n\n283\n00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:48.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n284\n00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:52.940\n&gt;&gt; And just pull it out and this be fine,\nso this is a great example of sometimes\n\n285\n00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.610\nmaybe the path of least\nresistance like you're saying,\n\n286\n00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:57.185\nuse this great intelligent feature.\n\n287\n00:14:57.185 --> 00:15:02.620\n[COUGH] It doesn't always work\nexactly the way you want it to.\n\n288\n00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:05.540\nAnd maybe we should do the functions,\nis that what you're?\n\n289\n00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:06.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n290\n00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:10.785\nIt's the non-determinism that\nhurts my heart and my brain.\n\n291\n00:15:10.785 --> 00:15:13.044\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know, I know that definitely.\n\n292\n00:15:13.044 --> 00:15:15.024\nWell, you're, you're, total little brain.\n\n293\n00:15:15.024 --> 00:15:17.524\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which is very true, so\n\n294\n00:15:17.524 --> 00:15:23.880\nI could stop there but I just want for one\nlast little thing and it's kind of geeky.\n\n295\n00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:27.890\nAnd it kind of gets into an area\nthat I love to talk about.\n\n296\n00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:32.160\nBut I'm gonna take a brief just to\nnot go completely off the rails.\n\n297\n00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.750\nBecause you have the left,\nand the right and the mid.\n\n298\n00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:41.600\nBut you also have left B,\nright B and mid B.\n\n299\n00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.820\nWhat does that mean?\n\n300\n00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.310\nSo we're just gonna go with left for\nthis example.\n\n301\n00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:51.800\nWe're talking about,\nin our language right now,\n\n302\n00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.550\nthat we are in a single byte language.\n\n303\n00:15:54.550 --> 00:16:00.560\nBut there are other characters, or\nother language sets, that we have left B\n\n304\n00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:05.170\nreturns the first characters based\non the number of bytes you specify.\n\n305\n00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:11.074\nAnd this is where,\nare you familiar with the CJK,\n\n306\n00:16:11.074 --> 00:16:19.290\nbasically, the Eastern languages such\nas Chinese or Japanese or Korean.\n\n307\n00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:24.390\nThose character sets, those characters,\nthey're considered double byte fonts.\n\n308\n00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:28.430\nThey're considered double bytes because\nthe information that they have to carry\n\n309\n00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:32.160\nin order to represent that\nparticular character on screen.\n\n310\n00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:37.060\nIt takes more information than us or\nour language in the sense of like an a or\n\n311\n00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:38.450\nan e or an i.\n\n312\n00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:41.650\nAnd this is stuff that,\nbecause you know me and typography and\n\n313\n00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:42.300\neverything like that.\n\n314\n00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.940\nI can start really geeking\nout on this stuff.\n\n315\n00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:48.790\nBut it's something that I just\nwanted to throw out that in\n\n316\n00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:52.090\nother languages you might\nhave to use the left b.\n\n317\n00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:57.300\nNow it does say down in here that\nyou do have to have like this is\n\n318\n00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:03.500\nonly going to work if your DBCS.\n\n319\n00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.780\nDouble Byte Character Sets,\nis the default language on the machine.\n\n320\n00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:13.270\nI don't have anything other than English,\n\n321\n00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:17.980\nso I can't fully attest to this,\nI can't read this.\n\n322\n00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.840\nBut I just wanted to throw that out for\nyou and if you want to\n\n323\n00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:24.840\nget kind of geeky on this stuff, it's\njust going in your Wikipedia articles.\n\n324\n00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:26.200\nAnd, like, what it actually means and\n\n325\n00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:30.840\nthis is where, like, how we actually get\nthe letter a to show up in your screen.\n\n326\n00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:34.440\nAnd, like, encoding character sets and\nWe've talked about this,\n\n327\n00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.580\nit was like your Unicode and your ASCII.\n\n328\n00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:38.860\nSo if you want to go down\na rabbit hole [LAUGH] and\n\n329\n00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.200\njust kind of get a little geeky on this.\n\n330\n00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:46.030\nSo if like how it actually represents\ncharacters and the code points.\n\n331\n00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:50.640\nAnd it's almost like the little dots\nthat is actually making your letters\n\n332\n00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:55.790\non the screen and how it all kind of\nbrings down into your byte information,\n\n333\n00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:57.720\nsingle byte fonts, double byte fonts.\n\n334\n00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:01.800\nThey actually have triple byte fonts,\nwhich I'm not really very familiar with.\n\n335\n00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:04.350\nBut anyway, so just check this out.\n\n336\n00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:05.390\nRead a little bit about it.\n\n337\n00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:09.230\nIf it gets a little too heady for you and\nyou get into encoding methods and\n\n338\n00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:11.090\nstuff like that, you might wanna stop.\n\n339\n00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:15.780\nBut the CJK, Chinese, Japanese, Korean.\n\n340\n00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.940\nThat's what they're talking about when\nthey were referring to languages that\n\n341\n00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:22.320\nare in a double byte character set.\n\n342\n00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:27.610\nAnd that's why you do have\na function in Excel that has that\n\n343\n00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:33.700\nb on the end if you need it to\nfind double byte character sets.\n\n344\n00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:37.400\n&gt;&gt; Well I'll tell you what Vonne that is\nmaking my head hurt a little bit, but\n\n345\n00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.640\nit's good to know because there\nmay be a particular use case.\n\n346\n00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.290\nIt's not something that I\ntypically think about but\n\n347\n00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:44.690\nit's very interesting nonetheless.\n\n348\n00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:47.360\nGot to be careful with\nthat Wikipedia surfing.\n\n349\n00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:50.510\nBut you know what, that was so\nheady that I might have to go take a nap.\n\n350\n00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:53.110\nBut luckily, I'll be well rested for\nour next episode.\n\n351\n00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:54.850\nAnd well, you should come on back with me.\n\n352\n00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:56.810\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n353\n00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:59.810\nSo signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n354\n00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:00.510\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n355\n00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:01.218\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n356\n00:19:01.218 --> 00:19:08.968\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

OfficePro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.650\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n4\n00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.660\nAnd we're continuing on with Excel\nfunctions, and, well, in this episode,\n\n5\n00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.340\nwe're gonna be looking at proper lower and\nupper, if I remember correctly.\n\n6\n00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.400\nIt was just on the lower third.\n\n7\n00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.640\nSometimes your mind goes blank.\n\n8\n00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.940\nBut luckily we have someone who knows\nexactly what we're talking about,\n\n9\n00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:31.510\nMiss Vonne Smith.\n\n10\n00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:32.340\nHow you doing today, Vonne?\n\n11\n00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.000\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing pretty good, and, yeah,\nyou got them all, different order.\n\n12\n00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.160\nIt's all tomato tomato.\n\n13\n00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.020\nForwards backwards.\n\n14\n00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.220\nIt's all good, but\nwe are gonna be talking about text.\n\n15\n00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:49.240\nMore of different text functions within\nExcel, because it's something that\n\n16\n00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.730\nExcel doesn't have by default,\nof how to capitalize something.\n\n17\n00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.870\nOr if I type in something in Word,\nand it's all in lowercase,\n\n18\n00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.010\nI just select it choose change case, and\nthen I can go ahead and capitalize it.\n\n19\n00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.610\nDoing it all uppercase.\n\n20\n00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.390\nOr I could do sentence case,\nwhere it only capitalizes the first word.\n\n21\n00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.480\nOr I want the first letter\nof the first word or\n\n22\n00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.450\ndo I want it to go ahead and capitalize\nthe first letters of all of our words?\n\n23\n00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.000\nTrying to keep it all straight.\n\n24\n00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.090\nThese are just quick little\nbuttons you click in Word.\n\n25\n00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.340\nYou don't have that in Excel.\n\n26\n00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.950\nSo we're going to show you how you can\nuppercase some text with a function,\n\n27\n00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.560\nthe upper function.\n\n28\n00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.310\nLowercase something, think you get that.\n\n29\n00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.470\nLower and\n\n30\n00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.360\nproper, that would be to capitalize\nthe first letters of every word.\n\n31\n00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.740\nWhy don't we c'mon down and take a look.\n\n32\n00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.567\nI have my file called upper,\nlower, proper.\n\n33\n00:01:45.567 --> 00:01:48.745\nI got this particular worksheet and\nI've got some text over here.\n\n34\n00:01:48.745 --> 00:01:52.340\nNow I mixed them up on purpose.\n\n35\n00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.620\nSome of them are lowercase,\nsome of them are upper.\n\n36\n00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.670\nSome of them got some weird\ncapitalizations all throughout here.\n\n37\n00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.655\nAnd I also have some that have multiple\nwords in here because all of these\n\n38\n00:02:01.655 --> 00:02:02.664\nare just single words.\n\n39\n00:02:02.664 --> 00:02:05.393\nAnd then I have the big white buffalo,\n\n40\n00:02:05.393 --> 00:02:10.350\nwhich is what we call Mr.\ncuz he is the white buffalo, so.\n\n41\n00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.850\nAnd that's what we've got, so\nwhy don't we go through our functions.\n\n42\n00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.670\nThis is one where there's not a lot\ngoing on in the particular function,\n\n43\n00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.200\nso I'm gonna take a gander and\njust type it out, and see what happens.\n\n44\n00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.000\nInstead of using the insert function\ndialogue box, we will type in equals.\n\n45\n00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.470\nI know the name of the function,\nit's upper.\n\n46\n00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.430\nAnd now, all I do is type in a first\ncouple of letters, hit the tab key, and\n\n47\n00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.290\nthen it populates with this particular\nfunction, which is gonna automatically\n\n48\n00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.150\nuppercase whatever cell that\nI put into the argument.\n\n49\n00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.540\nSo take A2, make it uppercase,\nand you hit enter.\n\n50\n00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.750\nThere you go, perfect.\n\n51\n00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.740\nSo if I take this,\ndouble click to go ahead and\n\n52\n00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.510\nautomatically populate down throughout\nthe entire range that I have,\n\n53\n00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.800\nthe contiguous range, and\nit does exactly that.\n\n54\n00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.148\nCool, that's it.\n\n55\n00:03:06.148 --> 00:03:10.380\nIn a sense of like there's nothing\nspecial or different about it.\n\n56\n00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.840\nI just want to uppercase all of\nthese cells within this argument.\n\n57\n00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.900\nIn this case, it's just one.\n\n58\n00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.640\nIf I want to lowercase, yep you guessed\nit, you just type in lower okay?\n\n59\n00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.470\nNotice I am using lowercase letters\nwhile I type in the function name.\n\n60\n00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.400\nCuz as soon as I hit Enter\nit's gonna just do that.\n\n61\n00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.910\nThat's just the syntax of Excel doing it.\n\n62\n00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.870\nSo I want to lowercase\nthis particular cell.\n\n63\n00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.200\nI'm gonna hit, Enter.\n\n64\n00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.740\nI would tell you just go ahead and get in\nthe habit of closing your parenthesis when\n\n65\n00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.550\nyou're typing out your functions, but\nit will do it automatically for you.\n\n66\n00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.680\nAnd then, alice, everything is lowercase.\n\n67\n00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.590\nAll letters go lower.\n\n68\n00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.570\nYou guessed it.\n\n69\n00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:52.970\nKeep on going.\n\n70\n00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.620\nProper is going to do.\n\n71\n00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.760\nWhoops, what did I forget there, Justin?\n\n72\n00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.140\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\nThere was like a flash of light.\n\n73\n00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.970\nDid you forget a parenthesis?\n\n74\n00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I got going too fast.\n\n75\n00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.460\nI started, see so easy and then boom.\n\n76\n00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.130\nAnd then once you start getting a little\ntoo over confident with yourself,\n\n77\n00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.120\nyou start going too fast,\nyou make mistakes.\n\n78\n00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.650\nSo why don't we just for fun,\nhey, tell myself to slow down.\n\n79\n00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.400\nLet's use the insert function dialog box.\n\n80\n00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.370\nWe are in our category of text.\n\n81\n00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.300\nThere's quite a few\ndifferent text functions.\n\n82\n00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.980\nWe are doing proper.\n\n83\n00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.840\nI will take the proper conversion\nstring and text to proper case.\n\n84\n00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.907\nThe first letter in each word to\nuppercase, all letters to lowercase.\n\n85\n00:04:40.907 --> 00:04:45.761\nSo if you did want better definitions\nthan me just saying make it all lower,\n\n86\n00:04:45.761 --> 00:04:50.630\nyou can get the nice technical\ndefinitions for this particular function.\n\n87\n00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.260\nAnd then it just says tell\nme what the argument is.\n\n88\n00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.780\nHere is the cell.\n\n89\n00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:00.917\nAnd then we click okay, and double\nclicking all of them with a single word.\n\n90\n00:05:00.917 --> 00:05:03.557\nYou don't really see it,\nbut definitely down here,\n\n91\n00:05:03.557 --> 00:05:07.260\nwhen you have multiple words within\na cell, the big white buffalo.\n\n92\n00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.330\nThat is what we get and\nwhat Mr. Fuego is called.\n\n93\n00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:13.770\nAnd there you go.\n\n94\n00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.550\nAll of these, just like a lot of the stuff\nwe've talked about in our functions\n\n95\n00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.140\nepisodes, this is going to be\na result of a formula or function.\n\n96\n00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.080\nThis is not text.\n\n97\n00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.560\nIf I tried to copy this and\n\n98\n00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.740\npaste it somewhere else into another\nsheet, just, why don't we do it?\n\n99\n00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.110\nOkay, if I copy this.\n\n100\n00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.750\nCome over and make a new sheet and\nthen just paste it.\n\n101\n00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:42.140\nIt's going to say, I don't understand\ncuz it's copying over the proper of B2.\n\n102\n00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.880\nThere's nothing in B2,\nit doesn't understand that.\n\n103\n00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.560\nSo you need to make sure that\nyou paste it as values only.\n\n104\n00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.634\nAnd you can go ahead and do it right\nhere when you went to another place.\n\n105\n00:05:52.634 --> 00:05:57.050\nYou could also do the fun paste and place.\n\n106\n00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.800\nYou can copy it.\n\n107\n00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.860\nYou can paste it from the button up here.\n\n108\n00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.460\nSo I just did a command,\nsorry this is Windows, Ctrl+c, and\n\n109\n00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.110\nthen take this, and\njust paste it right in place of my values.\n\n110\n00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.350\nAnd now they're all values.\n\n111\n00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.490\nOr, just for fun,\nlet's throw them all in there.\n\n112\n00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:15.835\nRight click drag and\n\n113\n00:06:15.835 --> 00:06:20.037\nthen back into the same space to\nget you the copy as values only.\n\n114\n00:06:20.037 --> 00:06:23.182\nAnd now they are not,\nthis one still is, but\n\n115\n00:06:23.182 --> 00:06:26.334\nthey are not going to\nbe functions any more.\n\n116\n00:06:26.334 --> 00:06:33.830\nAnd that's all I have for the functions\nas themselves, upper, lower and proper.\n\n117\n00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:38.385\nJust a couple quick little other\nexamples that you can go with this.\n\n118\n00:06:38.385 --> 00:06:42.660\nFlash fill, this might not be in\nthe exact sequential order, but\n\n119\n00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.776\nat the time of the filming we did\nour really fun text, join, and\n\n120\n00:06:46.776 --> 00:06:51.870\nconcat episode right before this,\nwhere flash fill blew your mind.\n\n121\n00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.290\nYou could do the same thing\nwith your capitalization.\n\n122\n00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.400\nLet's zoom in just a little bit so\nyou can see this.\n\n123\n00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.570\nAll lower, if I start typing\nin Alice with an uppercase,\n\n124\n00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:05.280\nas soon as I start typing in the other,\nit will find that as well.\n\n125\n00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.650\nAnd then if I wanted,\nI'm just going to Ctrl+z back into there.\n\n126\n00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:16.510\nI could also do the same thing with my all\ncapitals and then it will do that as well.\n\n127\n00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:20.546\nSo that intelligent fill,\nthe flash fill, super neat.\n\n128\n00:07:20.546 --> 00:07:26.460\nIt's already a so you don't even have to\nworry about copying and pasting as values.\n\n129\n00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.480\nIt does it automatically.\n\n130\n00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.200\nMan that flash fill, pretty awesome.\n\n131\n00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:37.160\nAnd then you can also use your\ndifferent cases with the upper, lower,\n\n132\n00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.130\nand proper as nested functions.\n\n133\n00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:44.450\nSo if I was using that\nreally cool text join\n\n134\n00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:48.070\nthat I had done in another\nepisode that I just mentioned.\n\n135\n00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:53.271\nI wanted the result to go head and\njoin it, but then also be in all caps.\n\n136\n00:07:53.271 --> 00:07:55.440\nWe can go head and upper that.\n\n137\n00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:00.777\nWe would just need to take all of this and\nmake that our upper.\n\n138\n00:08:00.777 --> 00:08:07.487\nSo you just have to know the syntax and\nhow to properly write a nesting function.\n\n139\n00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:09.250\nSo I strat with the if, no if?\n\n140\n00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:16.820\nThat would be the equals, and I type in,\nproper, open the parenthesis.\n\n141\n00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.960\nGot to make sure you\nclose the whole thing.\n\n142\n00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:24.347\nSo make sure you got all your nested\nparenthesis in the proper way.\n\n143\n00:08:24.347 --> 00:08:28.442\nAnd then it went ahead and what did I?\n\n144\n00:08:28.442 --> 00:08:31.170\n&gt;&gt; You typed proper on this,\nbut I know what you're saying.\n\n145\n00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:34.600\nBut this actually brings up an interesting\npoint that I was gonna make anyway.\n\n146\n00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:40.740\nThis is one way that you could ensure that\neverything was uniform, like your names.\n\n147\n00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.251\nSo if you had data entry and\n\n148\n00:08:42.251 --> 00:08:46.859\nsome of the last names were input with\nlowercase letters or anything like that,\n\n149\n00:08:46.859 --> 00:08:51.013\nyou could ensure that the arrive value\nwere all formatted the same way.\n\n150\n00:08:51.013 --> 00:08:53.755\nBut I was like,\nshe's gonna, wait a minute.\n\n151\n00:08:53.755 --> 00:08:54.791\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So whoopsie-daisy,\n\n152\n00:08:54.791 --> 00:08:56.890\nbut this actually brings\nup another use case.\n\n153\n00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:59.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because I was just like wait,\nthat was not what I expected.\n\n154\n00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.550\nOne, everything is already improper.\n\n155\n00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:04.250\nSo it's already doing that.\n\n156\n00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:10.460\nTwo, I was saying capitalize in upper,\nbut then I typed it in proper, so yeah.\n\n157\n00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:18.000\nBut back to where it's already proper if\nI made this a lowercase k, then it works.\n\n158\n00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.380\nAnd if I come back to here, change proper\nto what I originally thought in my head,\n\n159\n00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:24.670\nand actually came out of my mouth.\n\n160\n00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:26.930\nI said I was going to\ncapitalize everything.\n\n161\n00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:28.230\nLet's uppercase this.\n\n162\n00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:29.490\nThere we go.\n\n163\n00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:34.730\nAnd now I will get everything\nin uppercase as one function.\n\n164\n00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:38.450\nThe text join, which is another function,\nso you can nest this together.\n\n165\n00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:42.980\nYes, ensuring that everything comes out\nthe way that you want it formatted, and so\n\n166\n00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:46.090\nthat's where you can\nkinda join them together.\n\n167\n00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:47.630\nBut that's where you could go ahead and\n\n168\n00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:51.690\ndo a change case in Excel\nusing those functions.\n\n169\n00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:55.010\n&gt;&gt; And utilizing those appropriately and\n\n170\n00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:58.330\nwe actually saw two use cases\nwhere we're joining some text.\n\n171\n00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.390\nBut I want to make sure these\nare uniformly formatted.\n\n172\n00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.000\nWe don't have those buttons\nthat we have in Word,\n\n173\n00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.480\nso we have to use these functions,\nand make sure you pick the right one.\n\n174\n00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:11.224\nBut also notice you just put it on the\noutside instead of trying to figure out,\n\n175\n00:10:11.224 --> 00:10:14.274\nwell, wait a minute,\nI need to create another set of columns,\n\n176\n00:10:14.274 --> 00:10:16.824\nthen make sure those are proper and\nthen join those.\n\n177\n00:10:16.824 --> 00:10:20.140\nSo the actual order sometimes take\na little bit of trial and effort.\n\n178\n00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:23.850\nWell, thank you so much Vonne, and thank\nyou for joining us for this episode, but\n\n179\n00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:24.350\ncome on back.\n\n180\n00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:26.070\nWe got more Excel functions coming at you.\n\n181\n00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:27.880\nBut for now we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n182\n00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.590\nSo signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI’ve been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n183\n00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:31.550\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n184\n00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:32.398\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n185\n00:10:32.398 -->

OFFICEPRO.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.508 --> 00:00:18.002\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison,\nand choo choo,\n\n4\n00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:20.097\nwe're back on the Excel functions train.\n\n5\n00:00:20.097 --> 00:00:23.665\nAnd we're going to come back at you with,\ntrim and clean.\n\n6\n00:00:23.665 --> 00:00:26.522\nAnd if you're looking at me,\nyou're like, I don't know if that,\n\n7\n00:00:26.522 --> 00:00:28.542\nyou don't know anything about that,\nJustin.\n\n8\n00:00:28.542 --> 00:00:32.873\nWell, you're right, but luckily we\nhave our very own Excel engineer,\n\n9\n00:00:32.873 --> 00:00:33.944\nalso a train pun.\n\n10\n00:00:33.944 --> 00:00:36.286\nHere in the studio today to\ntell us all about it, Ms.\n\n11\n00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:38.430\nVonne Smith,\nhow are you doing today, Vonne?\n\n12\n00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.064\n&gt;&gt; I am trying so hard not to just\ncompletely laugh throughout your entire\n\n13\n00:00:41.064 --> 00:00:42.865\nintroduction, it's like choo choo,\n[LAUGH].\n\n14\n00:00:42.865 --> 00:00:45.179\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was just getting so\n\n15\n00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:48.150\nexcited about that intro,\nso thank you for that.\n\n16\n00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.157\nAnd yes, I'm doing great, we're going\nto talk about, yes, trim and clean.\n\n17\n00:00:53.157 --> 00:00:57.460\nAnd yeah, we're not talking about hair or\nbeards or anything,\n\n18\n00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.383\nwe're talking about text.\n\n19\n00:00:59.383 --> 00:01:03.867\nBecause these are text functions that\nyou can use to trim things up and\n\n20\n00:01:03.867 --> 00:01:05.193\nto clean things up.\n\n21\n00:01:05.193 --> 00:01:07.360\nYou're like,\nthat still doesn't tell me anything!\n\n22\n00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.787\nI know, I'm trying to keep it\npurposely vague to go ahead and\n\n23\n00:01:10.787 --> 00:01:12.209\ndemonstrate what it is.\n\n24\n00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:18.292\nSo I think the easiest way to show you\nwhat this does is to go right into it.\n\n25\n00:01:18.292 --> 00:01:20.827\nSo we're just going to\njump on down into here,\n\n26\n00:01:20.827 --> 00:01:23.047\nI've got some files already worked up.\n\n27\n00:01:23.047 --> 00:01:26.489\nSo if I am using Word,\nokay, I like Word and\n\n28\n00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:29.950\nit's one of my favorite courses to teach.\n\n29\n00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.852\nI mean, I love Excel as well, but\nthere's just something about Word.\n\n30\n00:01:32.852 --> 00:01:35.958\nI do a lot of typesetting as well,\nso when I have Word,\n\n31\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:40.180\nI have this wonderful button up here\ncalled the show and hide character.\n\n32\n00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:46.055\nAnd what that does is it's going to\nshow all of the hidden characters,\n\n33\n00:01:46.055 --> 00:01:48.654\nthe non printing characters.\n\n34\n00:01:48.654 --> 00:01:51.723\nBecause something like the space,\nif I turn this off,\n\n35\n00:01:51.723 --> 00:01:54.204\nthis just looks like regular text, right?\n\n36\n00:01:54.204 --> 00:01:58.703\nTrim, space, then a hyphen or a dash,\nwhichever one you want to talk about,\n\n37\n00:01:58.703 --> 00:02:01.004\nthen another space, and then I enter.\n\n38\n00:02:01.004 --> 00:02:05.345\nThere's an enter mark there, that does\nnot print out on a piece of paper,\n\n39\n00:02:05.345 --> 00:02:06.966\nbut it is a character code.\n\n40\n00:02:06.966 --> 00:02:11.055\nIt is a key stroke, it is something\nthat's in the program that says,\n\n41\n00:02:11.055 --> 00:02:14.877\nsomething happened,\nyou hit the space bar, you hit the enter.\n\n42\n00:02:14.877 --> 00:02:19.475\nIf I came in here and hit the tab,\nthat's not space space space space space.\n\n43\n00:02:19.475 --> 00:02:20.970\nThis is a huge thing for me,\n\n44\n00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.490\nand anything or anybody really\nthat's going to work with Word.\n\n45\n00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.116\nWe should know what these are and\nunderstand it really carefully.\n\n46\n00:02:27.116 --> 00:02:30.187\nBecause it makes a huge difference as\nto whether you're doing tab stops or\n\n47\n00:02:30.187 --> 00:02:30.837\ndoing spaces.\n\n48\n00:02:30.837 --> 00:02:35.214\nBut, I digress, as I start talking about\nWord and I get really excited, but\n\n49\n00:02:35.214 --> 00:02:38.991\nsomething like this is going to tell me,\nis there a space before?\n\n50\n00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:40.823\nIs there a space after?\n\n51\n00:02:40.823 --> 00:02:43.881\nIs there two spaces after?\n\n52\n00:02:43.881 --> 00:02:46.933\nThat can make a huge difference\nif I am trying to find\n\n53\n00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:51.699\nan exact replica of something, especially\nwhen it starts getting into Excel.\n\n54\n00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:53.155\nSo let's switch over.\n\n55\n00:02:53.155 --> 00:02:57.536\nSo I have this same text that\nis right here, all right,\n\n56\n00:02:57.536 --> 00:03:02.129\nit is in column one of this\nparticular worksheet, okay?\n\n57\n00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.970\nAnd if I was looking at, just to remind\nmyself, it's the one, two, three,\n\n58\n00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.827\nthe third one, okay,\nif I was looking at this third one.\n\n59\n00:03:08.827 --> 00:03:10.729\nThat doesn't look like there's\nanything wrong with that, does it?\n\n60\n00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:15.354\nOkay, now, this one I can visibly\nsee the space before it, but\n\n61\n00:03:15.354 --> 00:03:17.114\nI don't see any space.\n\n62\n00:03:17.114 --> 00:03:21.115\nAnd probably most of the time, this might\nnot even be that big of a deal to you,\n\n63\n00:03:21.115 --> 00:03:23.349\nespecially if you're just storing data.\n\n64\n00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:27.015\nAnd you're typing along, you\naccidentally hit the space bar after or\n\n65\n00:03:27.015 --> 00:03:29.643\nbefore you went ahead and\ngone on to the next cell.\n\n66\n00:03:29.643 --> 00:03:30.900\nMaybe not that big of a deal.\n\n67\n00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.158\nYou start getting into look up functions\nwhere I'm looking up a specific value and\n\n68\n00:03:35.158 --> 00:03:37.580\nit has to match that if\nyou have an extra space.\n\n69\n00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.545\nHello World and\nHello World space is not the same, and\n\n70\n00:03:41.545 --> 00:03:46.142\nthat's where you might start\nrunning into issues or errors.\n\n71\n00:03:46.142 --> 00:03:49.236\nSo it might be better if I could be like,\nhey, you know what,\n\n72\n00:03:49.236 --> 00:03:51.260\nI really just want to clean this all up.\n\n73\n00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.113\nWell, let me say that,\nI'm going to trim this up because the trim\n\n74\n00:03:56.113 --> 00:04:01.308\nfunction is a function in itself\nthat will allow you to do just that.\n\n75\n00:04:01.308 --> 00:04:02.853\nYou know what?\nI just realized that I already\n\n76\n00:04:02.853 --> 00:04:04.498\nhave the results over here,\nsee right here?\n\n77\n00:04:04.498 --> 00:04:09.395\nThat is a trim of this, I forgot to take\nthat out before we started this exercise,\n\n78\n00:04:09.395 --> 00:04:12.866\nthat's okay,\nthat's supposed to be blank right here.\n\n79\n00:04:12.866 --> 00:04:15.942\nBut I want to get rid of it,\nand this is where people say,\n\n80\n00:04:15.942 --> 00:04:18.705\nwell, couldn't you just use a find and\nreplace?\n\n81\n00:04:18.705 --> 00:04:24.303\nLike, find an extra space, you could,\nbut that's more back in Word.\n\n82\n00:04:24.303 --> 00:04:28.428\nNow the advanced functionality of find and\nreplace in Excel might not work as fast.\n\n83\n00:04:28.428 --> 00:04:31.017\nEspecially since you already\nhave a function that does that,\n\n84\n00:04:31.017 --> 00:04:32.422\nthat's what we're going to do.\n\n85\n00:04:32.422 --> 00:04:40.039\nSo the trim will remove extra spaces but\nit doesn't remove spaces in between.\n\n86\n00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:43.888\nBecause you're like, I don't want to have\nthe Hello World become Hello World with no\n\n87\n00:04:43.888 --> 00:04:44.861\nspace in between it.\n\n88\n00:04:44.861 --> 00:04:47.844\nIt doesn't do that what\nthe trim function does and\n\n89\n00:04:47.844 --> 00:04:51.771\nI'm just going to type this one\nout because it's pretty simple.\n\n90\n00:04:51.771 --> 00:04:55.808\nIs it's going to look at this cell and\n\n91\n00:04:55.808 --> 00:05:01.166\ntrim off the spaces before and\nthe spaces after.\n\n92\n00:05:01.166 --> 00:05:06.585\nSo if I hit enter,\nnotice the space in between the two words\n\n93\n00:05:06.585 --> 00:05:12.020\nare not going to be removed,\nso that's a good thing to do.\n\n94\n00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.607\nAnd again if I put my cursor in here,\nyou could see,\n\n95\n00:05:15.607 --> 00:05:18.117\nthat it is I believe it's this one.\n\n96\n00:05:18.117 --> 00:05:21.172\nThere's one of them in here that\nhas an extra space at the end.\n\n97\n00:05:21.172 --> 00:05:23.431\nBut we want to make sure\nthat we get rid of that, so\n\n98\n00:05:23.431 --> 00:05:25.152\nthat's what the trim is going to do.\n\n99\n00:05:25.152 --> 00:05:28.997\nA very simple function that\nwill kind of clean up,\n\n100\n00:05:28.997 --> 00:05:32.215\nI use that sparingly, the word clean up.\n\n101\n00:05:32.215 --> 00:05:34.233\nIt's just like, swipe up,\nnot the function,\n\n102\n00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:36.212\nbecause that is something different, okay?\n\n103\n00:05:36.212 --> 00:05:40.143\nSo anyways, simple,\nnot too terribly hard, and by itself,\n\n104\n00:05:40.143 --> 00:05:44.842\nthat's all it does, just remember\nthis is a function, this is not text.\n\n105\n00:05:44.842 --> 00:05:49.144\nSo if you needed this to\nbecome text in another place,\n\n106\n00:05:49.144 --> 00:05:55.086\nyou would need to copy the text and\npaste it back into place as just values.\n\n107\n00:05:55.086 --> 00:05:57.757\nBecause if you try take\nthis somewhere else,\n\n108\n00:05:57.757 --> 00:06:01.495\nyou don't want the function to\ncome along as the data in a cell.\n\n109\n00:06:01.495 --> 00:06:06.359\nYou want the values to come out and now I\nhave removed any space in the beginning,\n\n110\n00:06:06.359 --> 00:06:07.673\nany space at the end.\n\n111\n00:06:07.673 --> 00:06:12.122\nAnd it took out all of them from there,\nso that's pretty cool.\n\n112\n00:06:12.122 --> 00:06:16.225\n&gt;&gt; Real quick question here, Vonne,\nthat last in row five, Hello,\n\n113\n00:06:16.225 --> 00:06:17.924\nis that space space World?\n\n114\n00:06:17.924 --> 00:06:19.018\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n115\n00:06:19.018 --> 00:06:24.213\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\ntrim actually takes that extra space out?\n\n116\n00:06:24.213 --> 00:06:28.754\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it does, but\nit doesn't take a single space out, okay?\n\n117\n00:06:28.754 --> 00:06:32.853\nSo for example, if I take here, right?\n\n118\n00:06:32.853 --> 00:06:33.971\nSee the result?\n\n119\n00:06:33.971 --> 00:06:36.005\nWait, wait, did I pass?\n\n120\n00:06:36.005 --> 00:06:38.811\nI pasted it as values,\nhold on one second, let's back up.\n\n121\n00:06:38.811 --> 00:06:43.572\nOkay, let's come back to here, so\nthis is our function, correct?\n\n122\n00:06:43.572 --> 00:06:47.804\nSo let's come into here,\nwe've got a couple of spaces in between,\n\n123\n00:06:47.804 --> 00:06:49.298\nlet's see the result.\n\n124\n00:06:49.298 --> 00:06:52.072\nYes, it just won't take out multiple,\n\n125\n00:06:52.072 --> 00:06:56.158\nit won't take out a single\nspace between the words, okay?\n\n126\n00:06:56.158 --> 00:06:59.578\nBecause that way, if it's another single,\nif it took out all spaces,\n\n127\n00:06:59.578 --> 00:07:01.126\nthat wouldn't make any sense.\n\n128\n00:07:01.126 --> 00:07:05.593\nSo yes, if you had a bunch in between,\nit will go ahead and trim that.\n\n129\n00:07:05.593 --> 00:07:09.984\nIt's almost like it's looking at each word\nindividually and then saying, okay, well,\n\n130\n00:07:09.984 --> 00:07:11.154\nthere's another one.\n\n131\n00:07:11.154 --> 00:07:13.568\nAt least that's what I'm trying to go\nthrough the logic and I'm like, yeah, but\n\n132\n00:07:13.568 --> 00:07:14.692\nthat kind of breaks at the beginning.\n\n133\n00:07:14.692 --> 00:07:19.741\nAnyways, multiple spaces,\nwhether it's in the front or\n\n134\n00:07:19.741 --> 00:07:23.048\nthe back or in between, will go away.\n\n135\n00:07:23.048 --> 00:07:28.286\nAnd I just kind of contradicted myself\nbecause there was a single space here,\n\n136\n00:07:28.286 --> 00:07:30.228\nit got rid of a single space.\n\n137\n00:07:30.228 --> 00:07:32.357\nIt gets rid of your extra spaces, [LAUGH].\n\n138\n00:07:32.357 --> 00:07:35.025\n&gt;&gt; All right, I think that,\nextra spaces, right?\n\n139\n00:07:35.025 --> 00:07:37.559\nBecause actually,\nat the beginning of some text and\n\n140\n00:07:37.559 --> 00:07:41.028\nat the end of some text are a little\nbit different than words in between.\n\n141\n00:07:41.028 --> 00:07:44.611\nSo, now in my world, you actually have\nto treat those differently anyway.\n\n142\n00:07:44.611 --> 00:07:48.455\nSo I'm like, no, that's probably right,\nit removes extra spaces,\n\n143\n00:07:48.455 --> 00:07:51.093\nit really cuts down on the beginning and\nthe end.\n\n144\n00:07:51.093 --> 00:07:55.529\nBut I find it kind of interesting, this is\nreally helpful because it will get rid of\n\n145\n00:07:55.529 --> 00:07:57.991\nduplicate spaces that exist between words.\n\n146\n00:07:57.991 --> 00:08:01.757\nBut you've been saying clean and then you\nkind of back up, what's that all about?\n\n147\n00:08:01.757 --> 00:08:06.085\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, because I don't\nwant to cloud the waters in here.\n\n148\n00:08:06.085 --> 00:08:11.010\nBecause the clean function,\nit does something a little different.\n\n149\n00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:13.518\nI brought this up, so we have clean.\n\n150\n00:08:13.518 --> 00:08:17.860\nIt removes all non-printable\ncharacters from text.\n\n151\n00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.150\nOkay, well, isn't that a space, right?\n\n152\n00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:29.160\nWell yeah, and I actually probably should\nhave went ahead and brought up the trim\n\n153\n00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:34.720\nExcel support, because I know that that\nbrings it up to that specific right here.\n\n154\n00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.497\nThere we go.\nSo just to kinda get us into what this is\n\n155\n00:08:37.497 --> 00:08:38.419\ndescribing.\n\n156\n00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:44.170\nIt removes all spaces from text except for\nsingle spaces between words.\n\n157\n00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:47.171\nThat was, should've just read that\nsentence off before trying to\n\n158\n00:08:47.171 --> 00:08:49.750\nturn it around and just be like,\nyeah, remove spaces.\n\n159\n00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:53.520\nThere we go.\nBut it is specifically a space,\n\n160\n00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.930\nlike you and I think of like,\nwe hit the space bar.\n\n161\n00:08:55.930 --> 00:09:02.280\nBut, Justin, you and I know that there\nis something in coding languages and\n\n162\n00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:08.879\nespecially, I remember it from HTML,\nis the wonderful non-breaking space.\n\n163\n00:09:08.879 --> 00:09:15.177\nA non-breaking space and a space,\nvisually, doesn't look any different.\n\n164\n00:09:15.177 --> 00:09:18.938\nIf I turn these characters off,\nHello World,\n\n165\n00:09:18.938 --> 00:09:22.126\nall of those look like spaces, right?\n\n166\n00:09:22.126 --> 00:09:23.590\nThey're not, okay?\n\n167\n00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:26.844\nThey are other types of characters.\n\n168\n00:09:26.844 --> 00:09:29.920\nYou see those little kinda\ncircley dot things at the top?\n\n169\n00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:35.560\nThat, in Word,\nis an indication of a non-breaking space.\n\n170\n00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:40.010\nHm, okay, well,\nwhere would I ever do this?\n\n171\n00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:42.717\nMaybe you're like,\nI don't even know what this is.\n\n172\n00:09:42.717 --> 00:09:45.063\nI've never encountered this.\n\n173\n00:09:45.063 --> 00:09:46.193\nYou'd be surprised.\n\n174\n00:09:46.193 --> 00:09:50.058\nIf you copy and paste things, especially\nfrom web pages, maybe put it into Word,\n\n175\n00:09:50.058 --> 00:09:52.522\nand you don't have a show and\nhide character on, and\n\n176\n00:09:52.522 --> 00:09:55.730\nyou're thinking like, okay,\nthat's just regular spaces.\n\n177\n00:09:55.730 --> 00:10:01.100\nIf you turn this on, they might actually\nbe coded with non-breaking spaces,\n\n178\n00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:05.250\nlike it's kinda like hard code space,\nnot like a normal space.\n\n179\n00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:09.801\nAnd you might not see any\ndifference until you get\n\n180\n00:10:09.801 --> 00:10:14.137\nsomewhere where it\nactually does make sense.\n\n181\n00:10:14.137 --> 00:10:15.728\nYou're familiar with this character.\n\n182\n00:10:15.728 --> 00:10:18.362\n&gt;&gt; I am, I try to stay away from\nit because of exactly what you're\n\n183\n00:10:18.362 --> 00:10:19.880\ntalking about.\n\n184\n00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:24.740\nIt sometimes crops up at\nthe most inopportune times,\n\n185\n00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:28.520\nwhere you're like that's weird.\n\n186\n00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.317\nThat's not behaving like\nthe other times it behaves.\n\n187\n00:10:31.317 --> 00:10:33.139\nSo I try to stay away from them but yeah,\n\n188\n00:10:33.139 --> 00:10:35.647\nI'm all too familiar with\nthe non-breaking space.\n\n189\n00:10:35.647 --> 00:10:40.117\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so if you're copying\ninformation from, specifically like as\n\n190\n00:10:40.117 --> 00:10:44.876\na real-world example, a website and\nyou put it into Excel and then it's doing\n\n191\n00:10:44.876 --> 00:10:49.367\nthese weird spacing things,\nit's because you're bringing that over.\n\n192\n00:10:49.367 --> 00:10:53.427\nBut then this function right here,\nour CLEAN function,\n\n193\n00:10:53.427 --> 00:10:57.834\nit's going to remove non-printable\ncharacters from text.\n\n194\n00:10:57.834 --> 00:11:01.777\nSo if I come back over here to\nExcel cuz I'm like all right, well,\n\n195\n00:11:01.777 --> 00:11:06.091\nthis particular column right here,\nthese are non-breaking spaces.\n\n196\n00:11:06.091 --> 00:11:11.210\nI can't really show you in\nExcel that this is what it is.\n\n197\n00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:14.563\nI promise you, I copied it right\nhere from this Word document, okay?\n\n198\n00:11:14.563 --> 00:11:21.280\nSo that's where you know that =trim, and\nwe know that this isn't gonna work, okay?\n\n199\n00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.380\nBut just to kind of show you,\nbecause these aren't spaces.\n\n200\n00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.836\nSo I could go ahead and try and\nit's not gonna take out that extra stuff.\n\n201\n00:11:27.836 --> 00:11:30.360\nIt did take out these, right?\n\n202\n00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:35.410\nBut it didn't take out the beginning\nones because those beginning ones\n\n203\n00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:36.610\naren't spaces.\n\n204\n00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:38.470\nThey're non-breaking spaces.\n\n205\n00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:43.670\nOkay, well now,\nyou told me that clean works.\n\n206\n00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:45.039\nSo let's come back over here.\n\n207\n00:11:45.039 --> 00:11:46.970\nLet's go ahead and select the cell.\n\n208\n00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:51.110\nAnd instead of typing in trim,\nlet's type in clean,\n\n209\n00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:57.672\nbecause it says it'll do that,\nremove the non-printing characters.\n\n210\n00:11:57.672 --> 00:12:00.380\nThis still didn't work,\nwhat's going on here?\n\n211\n00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:04.670\nBut I thought you said it would go\nahead and remove that extra stuff?\n\n212\n00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:05.568\nAnd see here?\n\n213\n00:12:05.568 --> 00:12:10.170\nNotice that those two spaces didn't come\nout because they're non-breaking spaces.\n\n214\n00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:15.330\nWell, that's because if you come back over\nto here, there's a little note, okay?\n\n215\n00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:20.482\nAnd if you can't read that, I'll just\ntell you that it says it was designed to\n\n216\n00:12:20.482 --> 00:12:25.639\nremove the first 32 non-printing\ncharacters in the seven bit ASCII code,\n\n217\n00:12:25.639 --> 00:12:28.389\nvalues 0 through 31, from text.\n\n218\n00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:29.990\nWait a second.\n\n219\n00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:33.457\nSo you're actually not telling\nme all non-printing characters,\n\n220\n00:12:33.457 --> 00:12:35.723\nvery specific non-printing characters.\n\n221\n00:12:35.723 --> 00:12:42.670\nAnd you're also talking about back in\nthe ASCII language of 0 through 31.\n\n222\n00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:44.450\nOkay.\nAnd then we get into this Unicode and\n\n223\n00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:46.660\nthere's some other values right in here.\n\n224\n00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:49.601\nNone of these, by the way,\nare spaces, or non-breaking spaces,\n\n225\n00:12:49.601 --> 00:12:53.534\nbecause the Unicode value for non-breaking\nspaces is 160, which is not on this list.\n\n226\n00:12:53.534 --> 00:12:56.290\nAnd you're like, well,\nthat doesn't make any sense, okay?\n\n227\n00:12:56.290 --> 00:13:02.097\nSo this is a very specific function for\nvery specific values that,\n\n228\n00:13:02.097 --> 00:13:07.176\nI will tell you,\nmost of you all out there, I'd say pretty\n\n229\n00:13:07.176 --> 00:13:12.062\ncertain you probably won't\never encounter it, okay?\n\n230\n00:13:12.062 --> 00:13:15.560\nOther reason, if you're like ASCII,\nUnicode [SOUND].\n\n231\n00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.966\nYou gotta keep me in check there, Justin,\ncuz I love to talk about this stuff.\n\n232\n00:13:18.966 --> 00:13:21.759\nBut everything that we type\nin has a specific code and\n\n233\n00:13:21.759 --> 00:13:25.887\nwhat we have are character sets and\nASCII was, think about the progression of\n\n234\n00:13:25.887 --> 00:13:30.076\na computer language and how it actually\nunderstands it, and all these ones and\n\n235\n00:13:30.076 --> 00:13:32.322\nzeroes, bytes and bits of information.\n\n236\n00:13:32.322 --> 00:13:36.637\nASCII was kind of like a very,\nI don't want to say primitive, but\n\n237\n00:13:36.637 --> 00:13:39.471\nlike an earlier adoption of the language.\n\n238\n00:13:39.471 --> 00:13:43.149\nAnd it had As and Bs and Cs and\njust regular characters, but\n\n239\n00:13:43.149 --> 00:13:47.808\nthere's a whole bunch of other characters\nout there that this particular\n\n240\n00:13:47.808 --> 00:13:50.081\ncharacter set couldn't support.\n\n241\n00:13:50.081 --> 00:13:54.847\nSo this was a seven bit only,\nso you have 128 characters.\n\n242\n00:13:54.847 --> 00:13:57.078\nWe all know there's more than\ncharacters out there, so\n\n243\n00:13:57.078 --> 00:13:58.888\nthat's when they started going to Unicode.\n\n244\n00:13:58.888 --> 00:14:03.491\nUnicode was like an expansion of that,\nbut what Unicode did is it went ahead and\n\n245\n00:14:03.491 --> 00:14:05.940\nhad to be backwards compatible.\n\n246\n00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:11.960\nSo the first 128 characters of the Unicode\nare really the ASCII characters as well.\n\n247\n00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.310\nSo lots of geeky stuff.\n\n248\n00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:15.560\nThis particular Wikipedia\n\n249\n00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:21.960\narticle does kind of give you a little\nbit down on the bottom of some of this.\n\n250\n00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.548\nJust like a very general so\nif you read this stuff, like I said,\n\n251\n00:14:25.548 --> 00:14:27.328\nthis is like my geek out stuff.\n\n252\n00:14:27.328 --> 00:14:29.810\nI love geeking out on character sets.\n\n253\n00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:32.760\nAnd then going on through here.\n\n254\n00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:37.600\nRegardless, if you're like okay,\njust know that it's how your\n\n255\n00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.656\ncomputer writes the characters\nin its code language.\n\n256\n00:14:41.656 --> 00:14:45.037\nAnd it has tables of these characters.\n\n257\n00:14:45.037 --> 00:14:48.978\nNow, sorry if I'm scrolling\nalong really fast.\n\n258\n00:14:48.978 --> 00:14:53.816\nThe first 32 characters in\nASCII language are things\n\n259\n00:14:53.816 --> 00:14:58.444\nthat I could not generate\nthese characters in Word or\n\n260\n00:14:58.444 --> 00:15:01.819\nExcel, because it's too advanced.\n\n261\n00:15:01.819 --> 00:15:05.404\nI am not going to give you\nthe character seven of the bell or\n\n262\n00:15:05.404 --> 00:15:08.781\nthe backspace or\nthe horizontal tab or the line feed.\n\n263\n00:15:08.781 --> 00:15:11.650\nNow these are things like our Shift+Enter,\nEnter.\n\n264\n00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:15.465\nThese are actually the characters that\nkind of, it's like built on top of this.\n\n265\n00:15:15.465 --> 00:15:16.990\nLike new line.\n\n266\n00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:18.294\nAnd it's just code, okay?\n\n267\n00:15:18.294 --> 00:15:19.260\nAgain, geeky stuff.\n\n268\n00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:25.555\nSo what I had to do to make this\nactually work, and show you that it ran.\n\n269\n00:15:25.555 --> 00:15:28.129\nSo I actually had to implement your\nhelp there, there, there, there,\n\n270\n00:15:28.129 --> 00:15:28.900\nJustin, didn't I?\n\n271\n00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.513\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Sure did,\ndid, I'll tell you what.\n\n272\n00:15:31.513 --> 00:15:32.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n273\n00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:36.340\nso we actually generated\nsome of these characters,\n\n274\n00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:41.490\nactually used Python to just sprinkle\nsome characters in among some text.\n\n275\n00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:45.450\nAnd typically what you're gonna see, some\nof these, now, not necessarily the new\n\n276\n00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:48.060\nline character or things like that,\nbut like that null character?\n\n277\n00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:51.220\nYou're gonna see those in\nold school transmissions.\n\n278\n00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:53.503\nOr like how information was saved.\n\n279\n00:15:53.503 --> 00:15:55.680\nOr maybe like Internet connections.\n\n280\n00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:59.059\nIt's not typically something you're\ngonna see in Word and Excel.\n\n281\n00:15:59.059 --> 00:16:00.912\nBut maybe you're copying and pasting.\n\n282\n00:16:00.912 --> 00:16:03.241\nMaybe there's some holdover there.\n\n283\n00:16:03.241 --> 00:16:08.850\nIt would still be nice to be able to\ntreat those, but yeah, we got it done.\n\n284\n00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:12.330\nIt was a little hit or miss there\na couple of times but we got it done.\n\n285\n00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:16.698\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would say this is almost\nantiquated stuff that you're not going\n\n286\n00:16:16.698 --> 00:16:17.208\nto see.\n\n287\n00:16:17.208 --> 00:16:18.748\nIf you have like super,\n\n288\n00:16:18.748 --> 00:16:23.907\nsuper old systems that you're generating\ninformation out of, possibly, but\n\n289\n00:16:23.907 --> 00:16:29.120\nagain, this is so core level that you're\nprobably not going to find it, okay?\n\n290\n00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.620\nBut since it's the geek part of me,\nI had to show you, and\n\n291\n00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:34.650\nI had to have Justin do this.\n\n292\n00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:38.850\nAnd yes, you've coded it,\nyou exported it as a CSV file.\n\n293\n00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:42.727\nI then took it and brought it in,\nand this is what we've got.\n\n294\n00:16:42.727 --> 00:16:47.133\nSo we have first, last, age, and favorite\nfood, right, of some of our hosts.\n\n295\n00:16:47.133 --> 00:16:49.400\nAnd this is what you generated.\n\n296\n00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.600\nI kinda went and messed it around.\n\n297\n00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.947\nBut see,\nthere's this weird box-looking thing.\n\n298\n00:16:53.947 --> 00:16:55.270\nHave you ever seen this?\n\n299\n00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:57.320\nI've seen this on my text messages.\n\n300\n00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.830\nOr whatever, where I didn't upgrade\nmy emoji set or what have you, and\n\n301\n00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:03.380\nsomebody's using this new emoji,\nI'm like, it's just a little box.\n\n302\n00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:08.500\nYou see this on Facebook or Instagram,\nit's just a box with an X on it,\n\n303\n00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.790\ncuz I don't have it,\nI don't have that character set.\n\n304\n00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:14.670\nAnd my computer or phone can't read it.\n\n305\n00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:15.660\nBut you'll see this as well.\n\n306\n00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.562\nSo this is hopefully, maybe this kinda\nbrings it into the real-world context and\n\n307\n00:17:18.562 --> 00:17:19.730\nyou have seen this before.\n\n308\n00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:21.180\n&gt;&gt; It's funny that you say that.\n\n309\n00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:23.722\nSo Unicode adoption was\napparently lagging for\n\n310\n00:17:23.722 --> 00:17:27.610\na little while, especially in\nprogramming languages and stuff.\n\n311\n00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:31.700\nAnd it's really started moving forward\nbecause of that exact reason, emojis.\n\n312\n00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:32.410\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n\n313\n00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:36.638\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so being able to type\nemojis in actual programming\n\n314\n00:17:36.638 --> 00:17:39.818\nlanguages has made a significant change.\n\n315\n00:17:39.818 --> 00:17:42.420\nThey're like, now, we got to go to\nUnicode so we can support these.\n\n316\n00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:45.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it has a character set.\n\n317\n00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:48.203\nIt has to have a code\nto put in the eggplant,\n\n318\n00:17:48.203 --> 00:17:51.494\nand the open mailbox and\neverything like that.\n\n319\n00:17:51.494 --> 00:17:53.136\nIt needs to understand that and\n\n320\n00:17:53.136 --> 00:17:56.620\nthen the different ones that they\nkeep on adding on and adding on.\n\n321\n00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:01.020\nA lot of times through your OS,\nor sorry, I'm on an iPhone,\n\n322\n00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:02.560\nso I have to go ahead and do that.\n\n323\n00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:05.000\nBut yes, it's going ahead and\ngiving me this.\n\n324\n00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.070\nNow on this particular one,\nI can see the little box.\n\n325\n00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:12.194\nOn this one, though,\nthere is one indication.\n\n326\n00:18:12.194 --> 00:18:14.840\nI'm like,\nthat's not being a number right there.\n\n327\n00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.459\nCuz it's on the left, not on the right.\n\n328\n00:18:17.459 --> 00:18:20.379\nBut if I didn't know,\nif I double-click here,\n\n329\n00:18:20.379 --> 00:18:24.451\nthere is an actual character there,\nand one of, and it's random.\n\n330\n00:18:24.451 --> 00:18:27.871\nSo I don't know what character this is,\nbut it's something, and\n\n331\n00:18:27.871 --> 00:18:29.810\nthat's an indication for me.\n\n332\n00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:32.990\nI can see there's a space here,\nI can see there's one here,\n\n333\n00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:36.550\nand I've kind of like,\nput them all together in random places,\n\n334\n00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:40.500\nto just kind of prove the point of like,\nit's going to take these out.\n\n335\n00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:45.100\nSo I know that trim, sorry,\nyes, trim is not going to work.\n\n336\n00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:49.200\nBut I will know that\nclean will take this out.\n\n337\n00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.110\nSo if I say, let's go ahead and\nclean this one up, okay?\n\n338\n00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:54.301\nAnd that shouldn't change anything\ncuz there's nothing wrong.\n\n339\n00:18:54.301 --> 00:18:59.309\nBut if I then take that,\nit brings all of that, the little box out.\n\n340\n00:18:59.309 --> 00:19:01.520\nIt takes the weird thing\noff of Cherokee's name.\n\n341\n00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:06.891\nAnd so what I could also do is take this\nand move it across to the last name.\n\n342\n00:19:06.891 --> 00:19:10.038\nAnd then I can pull this down so\nI can do it all at one time.\n\n343\n00:19:10.038 --> 00:19:12.820\nBut one thing that's a little\nbit weird with this one\n\n344\n00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:17.070\nis notice that it went ahead and\ntook this out.\n\n345\n00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:20.382\nIt has SmithAdams and RainbowBoose.\n\n346\n00:19:20.382 --> 00:19:24.322\nI just gave Cherokee a nice,\nfun little hyphenated name.\n\n347\n00:19:24.322 --> 00:19:26.038\nSo why is it doing that?\n\n348\n00:19:26.038 --> 00:19:29.030\nI thought that's a space,\nno, that's not a space.\n\n349\n00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:33.594\nThat is a weird special character\nthat only the clean will work\n\n350\n00:19:33.594 --> 00:19:37.293\nbecause I made Justin generate that code,\nokay?\n\n351\n00:19:37.293 --> 00:19:41.165\nInteresting, and then we could go ahead,\nI can zoom out just for\n\n352\n00:19:41.165 --> 00:19:45.489\nfun to show you that I could take this and\njust copy it all the way across.\n\n353\n00:19:45.489 --> 00:19:47.220\nAnd then just copy this all the way down.\n\n354\n00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:51.915\nAnd by the way, I went ahead and\nmade you 50], and I'm 29.\n\n355\n00:19:51.915 --> 00:19:55.900\n[LAUGH] But then it went ahead and\ntook those out.\n\n356\n00:19:55.900 --> 00:20:00.066\nAnd so yes, this function does work, but\n\n357\n00:20:00.066 --> 00:20:07.699\nonly in very specific cases that most\nof you will probably never encounter.\n\n358\n00:20:07.699 --> 00:20:10.611\nBut I had to spend a lot of time\ntalking about a function you probably\n\n359\n00:20:10.611 --> 00:20:11.410\nwill never use.\n\n360\n00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:17.162\nOkay, and then just to have a little bit\nmore fun, what about if it was both?\n\n361\n00:20:17.162 --> 00:20:22.077\nMaybe there's some weird special ASCII\ncharacters that have come from some\n\n362\n00:20:22.077 --> 00:20:25.927\nantiquated system, but\nthen there's some extra spaces.\n\n363\n00:20:25.927 --> 00:20:30.391\nBecause if I went ahead and did,\nall right, let's go ahead and\n\n364\n00:20:30.391 --> 00:20:32.540\ntrim this out, okay?\n\n365\n00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:36.007\nAnd then we take this and\nbe like, hm, all right,\n\n366\n00:20:36.007 --> 00:20:40.893\nwell, that went ahead and\nremoved this particular space right here.\n\n367\n00:20:40.893 --> 00:20:44.280\nSo tacos,\nthat came out cuz it was a regular space.\n\n368\n00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:48.040\nIt didn't take out the cheese or the space\nin the cheese right there because it's\n\n369\n00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.640\nnot a special, sorry, it's not a space.\n\n370\n00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:55.238\nSo I could go ahead and say,\nall right, well, take all of this.\n\n371\n00:20:55.238 --> 00:20:59.980\nAll right, so\nthis is going to become my argument.\n\n372\n00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:05.030\nAnd then run the clean on top of the trim.\n\n373\n00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:06.760\nNow of course,\nyou could do this one twice.\n\n374\n00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.774\nYou could go ahead and\nmake this one column and\n\n375\n00:21:08.774 --> 00:21:10.418\nthen clean that particular result.\n\n376\n00:21:10.418 --> 00:21:13.130\nBut I'm just basically\nnesting these all together.\n\n377\n00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:19.070\nSo I am taking out all of it and so\nnow all of my special characters come out.\n\n378\n00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:23.200\nThat report that will be using trim, and\n\n379\n00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.400\nit cleaned out all the spaces, and\nso now I have something like this.\n\n380\n00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:31.420\nAgain, probably won't ever have to nest\nthose two together, but just in case.\n\n381\n00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:35.070\nThese are all values, back over here\nall of these, they're not values,\n\n382\n00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:35.800\nthey are functions.\n\n383\n00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.090\nSo if you wanted them as values,\n\n384\n00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:41.292\nyou would have to copy,\npaste in place, as values only.\n\n385\n00:21:41.292 --> 00:21:47.470\nAgain, i'm kind of glossing over\nthis particular part because\n\n386\n00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:51.720\nI've filmed for ten days in a row now and\nhave said this in every single episode.\n\n387\n00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.962\nSo if this is the first\none you've ever come to,\n\n388\n00:21:53.962 --> 00:21:56.150\nyou're like,\nyou're really not talking about this much.\n\n389\n00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:58.224\nBut other episodes we do.\n\n390\n00:21:58.224 --> 00:22:01.990\nYou don't wanna copy over the function,\nyou wanna copy over the text itself.\n\n391\n00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:06.651\nSo pretty simple functions for\nvery specific reasons.\n\n392\n00:22:06.651 --> 00:22:10.320\nTrim and clean, we talked a lot\nabout it because I had to just,\n\n393\n00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.720\nI couldn't get away from\ntalking about character sets.\n\n394\n00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:18.110\nSo there you go, hope that helps and\nyou can use this in conjunction with other\n\n395\n00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:19.930\nfunctions along the way if\nyou need to go ahead and\n\n396\n00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:22.440\nget rid of those spaces and\ndo some other things.\n\n397\n00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:23.330\n&gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, Vonne,\n\n398\n00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:26.385\nyou're like a train coming down the tracks\nwhen it come down to character sets.\n\n399\n00:22:26.385 --> 00:22:30.240\nBut sometimes we just have to indulge\nin our little interests, right?\n\n400\n00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.825\nSo hopefully you found this interesting.\n\n401\n00:22:32.825 --> 00:22:33.830\nI did.\n\n402\n00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:35.829\nIt was fun to generate that for\nyou, Vonne.\n\n403\n00:22:35.829 --> 00:22:38.226\nAnd well,\nyou never know when it's going to come up,\n\n404\n00:22:38.226 --> 00:22:41.390\nthat one time you're like, yeah,\nclean will get rid of this.\n\n405\n00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:42.763\nIt'll clean it up for me.\n\n406\n00:22:42.763 --> 00:22:44.310\nAnd you'll go, thank you, Vonne.\n\n407\n00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:46.227\nAnd well, you better come on back.\n\n408\n00:22:46.227 --> 00:22:47.988\nCuz we got more Excel\nfunctions coming at you.\n\n409\n00:22:47.988 --> 00:22:49.540\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n410\n00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:52.230\nSo signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n411\n00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.980\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n412\n00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:54.930\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n413\n00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:59.598\n[SOUND]\n\n",

OfficePro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.633 --> 00:00:17.188\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison and\n\n4\n00:00:17.188 --> 00:00:19.456\nwe're coming back at you\nwith more Excel functions.\n\n5\n00:00:19.456 --> 00:00:22.121\nBecause we know you love them and\nyou asked for more of them, so\n\n6\n00:00:22.121 --> 00:00:23.625\nwe're bringing them to you.\n\n7\n00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:28.424\nAnd in this episode, in particular, we're\ngonna be talking about char code, unichar,\n\n8\n00:00:28.424 --> 00:00:29.004\nunicode.\n\n9\n00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:32.470\nI think I got all those right and\nwe'll see if I, in fact, did.\n\n10\n00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.449\nBecause we have someone very special\nto help us along in this endeavor, Ms.\n\n11\n00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:36.018\nVonne Smith.\n\n12\n00:00:36.018 --> 00:00:36.759\nHow are you today, Vonne?\n\n13\n00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:39.461\n&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm doing very good and\nyou did a very good job with that one.\n\n14\n00:00:39.461 --> 00:00:39.988\nSo good job.\n\n15\n00:00:39.988 --> 00:00:40.536\nGood job.\n\n16\n00:00:40.536 --> 00:00:42.862\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Good job, well, I'll tell you what.\n\n17\n00:00:42.862 --> 00:00:45.432\nIt makes me happy that you\ntold me I did a good job.\n\n18\n00:00:45.432 --> 00:00:49.462\nI don't even know if I need to be here\nthe rest of this episode because well I'm\n\n19\n00:00:49.462 --> 00:00:51.956\nnot entirely sure what\nall of these things are.\n\n20\n00:00:51.956 --> 00:00:53.724\nWhat are we actually talking about?\n\n21\n00:00:53.724 --> 00:00:57.033\n&gt;&gt; We get to talk about something that's\nvery near and dear to my heart and\n\n22\n00:00:57.033 --> 00:00:57.662\nvery geeky.\n\n23\n00:00:57.662 --> 00:00:59.839\nI love to geek out on this stuff.\n\n24\n00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.656\nYes, I have talked about this before\non some other episodes if you were\n\n25\n00:01:03.656 --> 00:01:04.571\nwatching some.\n\n26\n00:01:04.571 --> 00:01:09.508\nWe get to talk about character sets and\ncharacter codes, and unicode,\n\n27\n00:01:09.508 --> 00:01:11.082\nand ANSI, and ASCII.\n\n28\n00:01:11.082 --> 00:01:17.031\nAnd all sorts of fun stuff and all about\ncharacters, about letters and sentence.\n\n29\n00:01:17.031 --> 00:01:20.413\nI also do a lot of graphic design,\nas well.\n\n30\n00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:25.557\nSo this kinda correlates right into my\nworld of fonts and ligatures and glyphs,\n\n31\n00:01:25.557 --> 00:01:30.571\nand all these different characters,\nand it's just fun stuff to talk about.\n\n32\n00:01:30.571 --> 00:01:33.550\nI will go ahead and\npreface this right now.\n\n33\n00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.930\nThese are functions, you probably\nwon't really encounter that much and\n\n34\n00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.010\nonce I show you you're going to be like...\n\n35\n00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.220\nI have no idea why I would\never use this and that's okay.\n\n36\n00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.030\nI am totally fine with that all.\n\n37\n00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:55.313\nSo is this one of the most primarily used\nfunctions, the jury is out on that one?\n\n38\n00:01:55.313 --> 00:01:59.330\nI will say using this in\ncombination with other functions,\n\n39\n00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.200\nthat's where you're gonna\nprobably see the most of it.\n\n40\n00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.999\nBut these episodes are meant to just\nlet's just explain what this does.\n\n41\n00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:11.549\nLet's define it and then get into some\nother examples of how I go ahead and\n\n42\n00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:16.471\nmake them all combined together and see\nwhere some real power can be from this,\n\n43\n00:02:16.471 --> 00:02:20.872\nbut we are gonna start off by just\ngoing a little bit through history and\n\n44\n00:02:20.872 --> 00:02:23.884\ntalking about what exactly\nis a character set?\n\n45\n00:02:23.884 --> 00:02:25.782\nSo why don't we just come on down?\n\n46\n00:02:25.782 --> 00:02:29.234\nI have some websites that I\nhave in the episode notes.\n\n47\n00:02:29.234 --> 00:02:31.500\nSo definitely check these out,\nthese are all listed here.\n\n48\n00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.280\nWhat is a character set?\n\n49\n00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.512\nWe're talking about difference and\nspecific character in codings and\n\n50\n00:02:39.512 --> 00:02:43.111\nthis website gets all very geeky about\nYou are not supposed to use these\n\n51\n00:02:43.111 --> 00:02:46.791\nparticular terms, and why you're\nnot supposed to use character set.\n\n52\n00:02:46.791 --> 00:02:47.972\nI use it all the time.\n\n53\n00:02:47.972 --> 00:02:49.881\nSo I'm like should I?\n\n54\n00:02:49.881 --> 00:02:50.862\nWhat am I going with?\n\n55\n00:02:50.862 --> 00:02:53.877\nAgain, like I said, this can a little.\n\n56\n00:02:53.877 --> 00:02:55.802\nIt can get a little geeky.\n\n57\n00:02:55.802 --> 00:02:58.693\nBasically, it's just\nthink of our alphabet.\n\n58\n00:02:58.693 --> 00:03:01.763\nABC, we're talking about English as well.\n\n59\n00:03:01.763 --> 00:03:06.033\nWe have certain characters within\nour language and that's what we use.\n\n60\n00:03:06.033 --> 00:03:09.223\nUppercase, lowercase,\nall those different things.\n\n61\n00:03:09.223 --> 00:03:13.390\nSo this is just kind of defining\nhow these are all in computer talk.\n\n62\n00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.078\nThis is like a certain code,\nbecause we know that computers are really\n\n63\n00:03:18.078 --> 00:03:21.424\njust a bunch of ones and\nzeros on and off switches.\n\n64\n00:03:21.424 --> 00:03:22.969\nSo we actually display, we take for\n\n65\n00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:25.337\ngranted sometimes like when\nyou type in the letter a and\n\n66\n00:03:25.337 --> 00:03:28.285\nwe have all the stuff disappear on\nthe screen, how does it all work?\n\n67\n00:03:28.285 --> 00:03:32.330\nHow does your computer know\nwhat letters you're even using?\n\n68\n00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.539\nThat's where you kind if really start\ndigging down into how this works,\n\n69\n00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:38.273\nit's all this kind of stuff.\n\n70\n00:03:38.273 --> 00:03:41.066\nAnd when you talk about\ncharacter encoding,\n\n71\n00:03:41.066 --> 00:03:45.551\nused to represent a repertoire of\ncharacters by some encoding system and\n\n72\n00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:49.314\nthen it starts talking about\nlike an electrical telegraph.\n\n73\n00:03:49.314 --> 00:03:54.344\nNow, we're going way back in history like\nhow did all this kind of stuff happen?\n\n74\n00:03:54.344 --> 00:03:58.105\nAnd how do we really think about\ncharacters and what they mean, and\n\n75\n00:03:58.105 --> 00:03:59.661\nhow we form our languages?\n\n76\n00:03:59.661 --> 00:04:02.429\nSee I'm already getting a little\nphilosophical on this stuff,\n\n77\n00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:03.512\nbecause it just starts.\n\n78\n00:04:03.512 --> 00:04:06.702\nYou can go down so many rabbit holes.\n\n79\n00:04:06.702 --> 00:04:09.360\nReading and learning about this stuff.\n\n80\n00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.370\nSo I'm trying to keep it up here,\nbut just like let's talk about this\n\n81\n00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.090\nfield data when we talk\nabout US Army Signal Corp.\n\n82\n00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.947\nAll certain ways of how\nyou can encode things and\n\n83\n00:04:21.947 --> 00:04:24.152\nwhere you get a specific a character.\n\n84\n00:04:24.152 --> 00:04:27.854\nNow they have some other geeky\nstuff like a coded character and\n\n85\n00:04:27.854 --> 00:04:30.842\nthe you have code point,\nand then a code unit, and\n\n86\n00:04:30.842 --> 00:04:35.422\nthen you get into these things like\nwe're talking about a lot of this stuff.\n\n87\n00:04:35.422 --> 00:04:41.296\nASCI and then you have UTF,\nUTF 8, 6, 16 and 32.\n\n88\n00:04:41.296 --> 00:04:42.572\nThe different bytes or\n\n89\n00:04:42.572 --> 00:04:47.481\nbits of information that is used to create\nthe characters of our different languages.\n\n90\n00:04:47.481 --> 00:04:52.179\nJust kinda going down through here,\na code page is a table of values describes\n\n91\n00:04:52.179 --> 00:04:56.171\nthe character sets for\nencoding a particular set of characters.\n\n92\n00:04:56.171 --> 00:05:00.042\nUsually with a number of control\ncharacters like when you hit the enter key\n\n93\n00:05:00.042 --> 00:05:01.051\non your keyboard.\n\n94\n00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:04.694\nWhen you hit the tab, when you hit\nthe Shift tab or do a line break,\n\n95\n00:05:04.694 --> 00:05:08.751\nall of those different things that we\nagain just kinda take for granted.\n\n96\n00:05:08.751 --> 00:05:12.210\nThere are certain things that happen here.\n\n97\n00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.281\nNow, the first one we're gonna\ntalk about here is ASCII.\n\n98\n00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:20.733\nIt stands for the American Standard Code\nfor Information Interchange.\n\n99\n00:05:20.733 --> 00:05:23.652\nIt's just how they started\nlike what is uppercase A?\n\n100\n00:05:23.652 --> 00:05:24.901\nWhat is lowercase a?\n\n101\n00:05:24.901 --> 00:05:25.940\nWhat is the number one?\n\n102\n00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.342\nWhat is the slash?\n\n103\n00:05:27.342 --> 00:05:36.002\nAll of those things and it has a list of\n128 characters that you have in ASCII.\n\n104\n00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:37.759\nIt goes through our bit deck.\n\n105\n00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:42.814\nIt's a 7-bit language or character set and\nthen it's just going through here.\n\n106\n00:05:42.814 --> 00:05:48.955\nIt also talks about and this is the one\nwe talked about with the Trim and Clean.\n\n107\n00:05:48.955 --> 00:05:54.335\nThat was the episode where I had you\ngenerate a specific code that I couldn't\n\n108\n00:05:54.335 --> 00:06:00.550\neven do on any of my computers, which you\ncould do with your Python coding language.\n\n109\n00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.191\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like we said before,\nthese are control characters.\n\n110\n00:06:03.191 --> 00:06:05.303\nYou might get a few of them that crop up.\n\n111\n00:06:05.303 --> 00:06:09.612\nBut a lot of times, these are some kind\nof interchange where we're saying, hey,\n\n112\n00:06:09.612 --> 00:06:10.611\nthis is a null bit or\n\n113\n00:06:10.611 --> 00:06:14.562\nthis is a null character which means\nend the transmission in this context.\n\n114\n00:06:14.562 --> 00:06:18.347\nTypically not on a keyboard, I've yet\nto see a keyboard that has a null key.\n\n115\n00:06:18.347 --> 00:06:19.513\nThat would be kind of weird.\n\n116\n00:06:19.513 --> 00:06:20.321\nShould it be there?\n\n117\n00:06:20.321 --> 00:06:21.562\nCuz it's null, I don't know.\n\n118\n00:06:21.562 --> 00:06:24.150\nBut yeah, we found a way around it.\n\n119\n00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.521\nBut for the most part,\nyou're not gonna encounter many of them.\n\n120\n00:06:26.521 --> 00:06:31.676\n&gt;&gt; And we talked about how in this ASC\nlanguage that those first 32 codes,\n\n121\n00:06:31.676 --> 00:06:35.151\n0 through 31 were those\ncontrol characters.\n\n122\n00:06:35.151 --> 00:06:39.367\nSo it's kind just like that history lesson\nof how we've progressed in this technology\n\n123\n00:06:39.367 --> 00:06:40.554\nand being able to do it.\n\n124\n00:06:40.554 --> 00:06:45.318\nKept those and then it went ahead and\nadd the rest, so\n\n125\n00:06:45.318 --> 00:06:48.471\nthere's a list of 128 values.\n\n126\n00:06:48.471 --> 00:06:52.650\nAnd if we start looking down through here,\nfor example,\n\n127\n00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:58.061\n65 right here, well then that's number\nfive and then we keep on going.\n\n128\n00:06:58.061 --> 00:07:00.102\nThere's A, wait that's 65 there.\n\n129\n00:07:00.102 --> 00:07:02.151\nSo there's the uppercase A.\n\n130\n00:07:02.151 --> 00:07:06.140\nKeep that in mind,\nbecause it’s gonna come back around.\n\n131\n00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.812\nSo there’s 128 characters.\n\n132\n00:07:07.812 --> 00:07:12.608\nWell, then what you have is you\nhave like another level of that\n\n133\n00:07:12.608 --> 00:07:17.600\nwhich is ANSI which is\nAmerican National Standards Institute.\n\n134\n00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:25.620\nSo it basically just extended\nthat character set to 256 or 255.\n\n135\n00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.192\nBy the way, these are all twos.\n\n136\n00:07:27.192 --> 00:07:27.923\nAren't they, Justin?\n\n137\n00:07:27.923 --> 00:07:31.846\nSo this is the whole math and computer\nstuff, and bits, and 8 bits, and 16 bits,\n\n138\n00:07:31.846 --> 00:07:32.690\nand everything.\n\n139\n00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:36.634\nAgain, mathy stuff where you're just not.\n\n140\n00:07:36.634 --> 00:07:41.641\nBut it went ahead and\nextended it out past the 127 to include\n\n141\n00:07:41.641 --> 00:07:46.082\nother things like the euro and\nsome other characters.\n\n142\n00:07:46.082 --> 00:07:48.142\nThere's the registered trademark.\n\n143\n00:07:48.142 --> 00:07:51.605\nThere's the copyright sign, 169.\n\n144\n00:07:51.605 --> 00:07:56.478\nThese are just numbers that people\nlike me, I've memorized a few of them.\n\n145\n00:07:56.478 --> 00:07:58.118\nI've memorized 169.\n\n146\n00:07:58.118 --> 00:08:02.059\nJust because I use that as an example\nin my different exercises.\n\n147\n00:08:02.059 --> 00:08:02.970\nOkay, cool.\n\n148\n00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:07.953\nSo we have ASCII and ANSI went ahead and\nmade it to a little bit bigger.\n\n149\n00:08:07.953 --> 00:08:09.167\nAnd then it's like, well, you know what?\n\n150\n00:08:09.167 --> 00:08:11.070\nWhat about all those other languages?\n\n151\n00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:15.695\nWhat about the oomlats and\nthe carrots and all the tildes, right.\n\n152\n00:08:15.695 --> 00:08:16.353\nThere's a lot of them.\n\n153\n00:08:16.353 --> 00:08:19.490\nI know some of them are in here,\nbut we need more.\n\n154\n00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:22.017\nSo that's where you started\nto go with Unicode.\n\n155\n00:08:22.017 --> 00:08:27.400\nAnd if you think about the name,\nUnicode, uniform, uniformality.\n\n156\n00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:33.117\nBecause it's kind of like everybody\nstarted making their own encoding methods.\n\n157\n00:08:33.117 --> 00:08:39.352\nLike how a Macintosh has their character\nsets is different than a PC character set.\n\n158\n00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:44.347\nThrough all this history, everybody is\ndoing their kind of versions of and\n\n159\n00:08:44.347 --> 00:08:46.470\ncodes of letters and numbers.\n\n160\n00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:47.348\nWell it's like, you know what?\n\n161\n00:08:47.348 --> 00:08:51.804\nThis is getting a little too crazy,\nwhy don't we just go to one system?\n\n162\n00:08:51.804 --> 00:08:53.070\nCool, that sounds great.\n\n163\n00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:56.711\nThe other thing we're gonna do, is we're\ngoing to extend our character sets.\n\n164\n00:08:56.711 --> 00:09:01.770\n256 or 255 is too limited,\nwhy don't we go bigger?\n\n165\n00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:07.724\nAnd that's where you have the unicode, and\nthen you start getting into the Unicorn.\n\n166\n00:09:07.724 --> 00:09:08.366\nUnicorn [LAUGH].\n\n167\n00:09:08.366 --> 00:09:12.126\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Now you're\ntelling me there's a unicorn,\n\n168\n00:09:12.126 --> 00:09:16.073\nthat I'm trying to think\nof ASCII art like unicorn?\n\n169\n00:09:16.073 --> 00:09:17.406\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But that's not what,\n\n170\n00:09:17.406 --> 00:09:18.533\nyou just meant Unicode.\n\n171\n00:09:18.533 --> 00:09:22.623\n&gt;&gt; I do like to talk about mythical\ncreatures and cats, and rainbows,\n\n172\n00:09:22.623 --> 00:09:26.588\nand stars and dancing bears,\nbut yes,in this sense, Unicode.\n\n173\n00:09:26.588 --> 00:09:31.833\nAnd it gets into your UTF,\nin your UTF 8, 16, 32.\n\n174\n00:09:31.833 --> 00:09:39.340\nAgain, think about eight, 16, 32, just the\namount of characters it can incorporate.\n\n175\n00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:43.871\nAnd that 65,536,\nthat is another thing with Excel.\n\n176\n00:09:43.871 --> 00:09:48.090\nIt's just the whole increments,\nnot increments, what are the two?\n\n177\n00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:48.742\n&gt;&gt; Powers of two.\n\n178\n00:09:48.742 --> 00:09:50.167\n&gt;&gt; Thank you [LAUGH] the powers of two.\n\n179\n00:09:50.167 --> 00:09:51.986\nI'm like the thing that\ngoes above the letter.\n\n180\n00:09:51.986 --> 00:09:54.121\nThe number of the exponents, exactly.\n\n181\n00:09:54.121 --> 00:09:59.040\nSo anyways, that's kind of a little\nhistory lesson of where we're at,\n\n182\n00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:03.719\nand that we have Unicode that took\nthe ASCII and ANSI up to 255, and\n\n183\n00:10:03.719 --> 00:10:05.590\nthen just added on more.\n\n184\n00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:10.699\nAnd so,\nthere's a whole other extension of codes\n\n185\n00:10:10.699 --> 00:10:15.820\nthat represent characters\nwithin our language.\n\n186\n00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.434\nNow just really quickly,\nthe difference between ANSI and ASCII,\n\n187\n00:10:18.434 --> 00:10:19.607\nI've already told you that.\n\n188\n00:10:19.607 --> 00:10:22.980\nIt's 128 to 256, but\njust going through our different ones.\n\n189\n00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.602\nSo, why are we even talking about that?\n\n190\n00:10:25.602 --> 00:10:31.668\nWhy do you give us a history on all of\nthese character sets and encodings?\n\n191\n00:10:31.668 --> 00:10:36.115\nBecause the CODE function in Excel,\n\n192\n00:10:36.115 --> 00:10:41.283\nwell, it's going to go ahead and return.\n\n193\n00:10:41.283 --> 00:10:46.634\nA numeric code for\nthe first character in a text string.\n\n194\n00:10:46.634 --> 00:10:48.836\nWow, I can't even read that\nsentence very well, can I?\n\n195\n00:10:48.836 --> 00:10:52.310\n[LAUGH] I'm having trouble with\nmy own character set in my brain.\n\n196\n00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:55.766\nOkay well, like isn't that what\nyou just showed us, Bob, right?\n\n197\n00:10:55.766 --> 00:11:00.417\nYou said I have a whole list of\neverything like, right here and\n\n198\n00:11:00.417 --> 00:11:04.007\nlike that's you told us\nwhat all that stuff is.\n\n199\n00:11:04.007 --> 00:11:05.436\nWell, guess what?\n\n200\n00:11:05.436 --> 00:11:06.790\nExcel does it too.\n\n201\n00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:11.977\nYou can go ahead and say, give me,\nwhat is the code value of the letter a?\n\n202\n00:11:11.977 --> 00:11:16.980\nWhat is the code value for letter v?\n\n203\n00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:20.416\nJustin is over there going, okay.\n\n204\n00:11:20.416 --> 00:11:25.233\n&gt;&gt; So, this is kind of an oddly specific\nthing, returning numeric code, got it.\n\n205\n00:11:25.233 --> 00:11:27.490\nFor the first character, okay?\n\n206\n00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:29.780\nAnd a text string.\n\n207\n00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:33.240\nBut can have a bunch of character,\nit's really weird to me.\n\n208\n00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.917\nWhy it's just the first one?\n\n209\n00:11:34.917 --> 00:11:36.405\n&gt;&gt; That's just what the function does.\n\n210\n00:11:36.405 --> 00:11:41.060\n[LAUGH] And exactly,\nyou're just like, all right.\n\n211\n00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.619\nJust nod and be like, okay, sounds good.\n\n212\n00:11:44.619 --> 00:11:48.417\nRemember I told you how many\ntimes are you gonna use this?\n\n213\n00:11:48.417 --> 00:11:51.030\nJust, I just want you to\nknow that they exist okay?\n\n214\n00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:54.732\nThe other thing I'm going\nto point out right now,\n\n215\n00:11:54.732 --> 00:11:59.598\nis you see how it says returns code with,\nbased on your computer.\n\n216\n00:11:59.598 --> 00:12:03.682\nIt depends on what operating\nenvironment are you working with?\n\n217\n00:12:03.682 --> 00:12:06.890\nANSI, well guess what,\nWindows goes ahead and use it.\n\n218\n00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:09.072\nAnd then you have\nthe Macintosh character set.\n\n219\n00:12:09.072 --> 00:12:13.713\nGod, this is where we get back to like\nthe old-school, where PCs and Macs are so\n\n220\n00:12:13.713 --> 00:12:19.050\ndifferent, they're still different,\nbut okay, keep that in mind.\n\n221\n00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:23.866\nThe Char function, or\nyou can just say character,\n\n222\n00:12:23.866 --> 00:12:29.471\nit's going to return the character\nspecified by a number.\n\n223\n00:12:29.471 --> 00:12:33.706\nThe Char to translate code page\nnumbers you might get from files or\n\n224\n00:12:33.706 --> 00:12:36.510\ntypes of computers into characters.\n\n225\n00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:40.527\nAgain, based on your system, hmm.\n\n226\n00:12:40.527 --> 00:12:46.550\nOkay, that,\nI just want you to know how these work.\n\n227\n00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:49.808\nJust go okay, that sounds great.\n\n228\n00:12:49.808 --> 00:12:53.828\nSo for example, I have some ABCs.\n\n229\n00:12:53.828 --> 00:12:55.600\nI already seen them in Wikipedia.\n\n230\n00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.790\nI know, but it's fun.\n\n231\n00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:02.322\nSo if I say okay, let's go ahead and\ngive me the code of this text.\n\n232\n00:13:02.322 --> 00:13:04.799\nWhoops, that text, how about there?\n\n233\n00:13:04.799 --> 00:13:08.260\nClose the parenthesis,\nhit Enter, and it's 65.\n\n234\n00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:13.916\nJust like the list and references that\nI've seen online that I can go ahead and\n\n235\n00:13:13.916 --> 00:13:17.408\nfind out exactly what\ncode number we have here.\n\n236\n00:13:17.408 --> 00:13:19.421\nNothing too crazy on that one.\n\n237\n00:13:19.421 --> 00:13:22.334\nWe could look up here and\nthen we come down to here and yep,\n\n238\n00:13:22.334 --> 00:13:25.510\nthese are the code numbers for\nthese particular characters.\n\n239\n00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:31.319\nSo, the exclamation point,\nthe dollar sign is code 36.\n\n240\n00:13:31.319 --> 00:13:36.126\nBy the way I just took this and\ncopied it, I did control C.\n\n241\n00:13:36.126 --> 00:13:38.080\nAnd then I'm coming over here and\npasting it.\n\n242\n00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.370\nAnd because of the relative reference,\n\n243\n00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:42.871\nit's then moving one\ncell over to the left.\n\n244\n00:13:42.871 --> 00:13:48.140\nSo, now it is finding the code of I1,\nit is not going back to the letter A.\n\n245\n00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:50.295\nJust join okay.\n\n246\n00:13:50.295 --> 00:13:51.284\nWell, that's great.\n\n247\n00:13:51.284 --> 00:13:55.702\nAnd that example that you said about\nit's going to return the character,\n\n248\n00:13:55.702 --> 00:13:59.190\nthe first character, it's like,\nokay, da da da da da and\n\n249\n00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:04.330\nthen you go, 49, 49, 49, 49,\nthat, doesn't seem correct.\n\n250\n00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.125\nWhy is that, Justin?\n\n251\n00:14:06.125 --> 00:14:10.869\n&gt;&gt; Because the number one is the first\ncharacter in that text stream.\n\n252\n00:14:10.869 --> 00:14:14.139\nAnd so it's going that's a one,\nthat's a one that's a one, that's a one,\n\n253\n00:14:14.139 --> 00:14:17.380\nall the way up til it gets to 20, which,\nthat's a two, so it brings back 50.\n\n254\n00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:21.274\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and same way, if I had done here,\n\n255\n00:14:21.274 --> 00:14:26.784\nif I said let's go ahead and\ngive me the code of this word.\n\n256\n00:14:26.784 --> 00:14:30.861\nIt's only gonna give me A, and\nthe same would be for all of these,\n\n257\n00:14:30.861 --> 00:14:33.395\nit's only going to give me the h or the w.\n\n258\n00:14:33.395 --> 00:14:37.754\nNo, it's lower case, and uppercase,\nthat's a very specific one.\n\n259\n00:14:37.754 --> 00:14:41.368\nIt's only gonna return the first one.\n\n260\n00:14:41.368 --> 00:14:43.380\nOkay, not too bad.\n\n261\n00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:48.750\nNow these over here,\nthese are special characters,\n\n262\n00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:54.851\nmeaning that these come from,\nwell, it's number 151.\n\n263\n00:14:54.851 --> 00:14:59.999\nSo Justin, is that ANSI or ASCI?\n\n264\n00:14:59.999 --> 00:15:01.990\n&gt;&gt; 120, it has to be ANSI.\n\n265\n00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:06.170\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and ANSI is ASCI,\nit's all kind of combined together.\n\n266\n00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:08.675\nAnd really, we don't even,\nit's just the same idea.\n\n267\n00:15:08.675 --> 00:15:10.539\nSo you got these different numbers.\n\n268\n00:15:10.539 --> 00:15:13.332\nOkay, kind of fun.\n\n269\n00:15:13.332 --> 00:15:16.060\nIf I come over here to the character,\nthis is the reverse,\n\n270\n00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:18.560\nhere are our numbers what\nis it going to give me?\n\n271\n00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:23.555\nIt's going to return me\nthe actual character based\n\n272\n00:15:23.555 --> 00:15:27.862\non those codes that, well, what's that?\n\n273\n00:15:27.862 --> 00:15:30.680\nWhy are these not giving me any numbers,\nJustin?\n\n274\n00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:31.916\nIt's almost like I'm in prison here.\n\n275\n00:15:31.916 --> 00:15:36.215\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, those are the control characters\nthat are zero to 31 that are typically\n\n276\n00:15:36.215 --> 00:15:38.985\neither printed on or\nhave very specific use cases.\n\n277\n00:15:38.985 --> 00:15:42.799\n&gt;&gt; Uh-mm, and I suppose I probably could,\nI could just that line to make to do\n\n278\n00:15:42.799 --> 00:15:46.572\nthe clean episode, but I'm not sure\nit will work just the right way,so.\n\n279\n00:15:46.572 --> 00:15:50.395\nAnd it's just kind of fun, cuz I wanted\nyou to generate some Python code for\n\n280\n00:15:50.395 --> 00:15:51.134\nme so,okay.\n\n281\n00:15:51.134 --> 00:15:52.504\nAll right, so, that's great.\n\n282\n00:15:52.504 --> 00:15:54.013\nWe go ahead and do the same thing.\n\n283\n00:15:54.013 --> 00:15:56.629\nI don't know why I just\ntyped that back out,\n\n284\n00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:59.883\nbecause I could just have\ncopied it same idea so now I'm\n\n285\n00:15:59.883 --> 00:16:04.790\ngetting a specific character, I could copy\nthis whole thing and put it over here.\n\n286\n00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:11.638\nHow about we go ahead and do copy and then\nwe do paste and then we pull it on down.\n\n287\n00:16:11.638 --> 00:16:18.460\nThese aren't above, these are above 128,\n[LAUGH] so this is in 256,\n\n288\n00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:22.310\nso these are extended characters and\nwe're like, okay, that's great.\n\n289\n00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:25.670\nI wanna point out something that's\nkind of fun, i'm gonna flip on over.\n\n290\n00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:29.110\nSo this is my Mac and\nI'm a Macintosh environment.\n\n291\n00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:31.353\nWhen I look at these, okay so\n\n292\n00:16:31.353 --> 00:16:36.313\nlet's first of all look at this\ncharacter one, so right here.\n\n293\n00:16:36.313 --> 00:16:40.010\nLet's just take a look at this Justin,\nespecially 170 right?\n\n294\n00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:45.751\nThis is mac and 170 in PC,\n\n295\n00:16:45.751 --> 00:16:51.275\nthat's not the same is it?, why?\n\n296\n00:16:51.275 --> 00:16:56.250\nCuz if this particular function,\nyou're talking about your,\n\n297\n00:16:56.250 --> 00:17:00.120\nprogrammer platform\nspecific character sets.\n\n298\n00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.555\nWe just talked about Mac and\nPCs aren't the same.\n\n299\n00:17:02.555 --> 00:17:06.470\n1-28 probably not gonna\nget that many issues.\n\n300\n00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:09.910\nWhen you go above 128 of\nyour character codes,\n\n301\n00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:12.210\nthat's where you're gonna\nsee some variations.\n\n302\n00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:17.045\nThe same thing over here where this is\nsaying that these are 151 and 150, those\n\n303\n00:17:17.045 --> 00:17:21.832\nare by the way m dashes and n dashes, the\nn, the m, the different length of dashes.\n\n304\n00:17:21.832 --> 00:17:26.539\nAnd there is certain reasons why you wanna\nuse n versus m, one is just long than\n\n305\n00:17:26.539 --> 00:17:31.680\nthe other cuz if you think about the m\nversus the n, that's the difference.\n\n306\n00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:35.030\nSorry, me and my typography geekiness.\n\n307\n00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:40.820\nBut if I look over here,\nthat's not the same, right?\n\n308\n00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:46.210\nSo this is just a little, this is where\nit gets a little different as to how and\n\n309\n00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:48.080\nthis, by the way,\nthat's actually a unicode.\n\n310\n00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:53.080\nSo don't disrupt that one, so\nlet's go ahead and just, so I'm\n\n311\n00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:57.250\ngiving away my secrets of where I'm going\nnext, okay?, different character sets.\n\n312\n00:17:57.250 --> 00:18:02.081\nAll righty, because if I come\nover here and I'm on a PC and\n\n313\n00:18:02.081 --> 00:18:07.531\nI say give me the code for\nthis guy and it's gonna be like, 63.\n\n314\n00:18:07.531 --> 00:18:10.559\n[LAUGH] That can't be right and\n\n315\n00:18:10.559 --> 00:18:15.533\nthat's 63 and that's 63 and that's 63.\n\n316\n00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:20.610\nOkay, let's just move on over here,\nbecause I could go ahead and\n\n317\n00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:25.960\ndo right from here, I could do,\nwell, give me the character of this.\n\n318\n00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:31.460\nAnd we could see that that's a question\nmark, because it doesn't understand.\n\n319\n00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:34.830\nThere's a whole bunch of\nquestion marks through here.\n\n320\n00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:35.920\nDo you know why, Justin?\n\n321\n00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.500\n&gt;&gt; I feel like Excel's just trolling us\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n322\n00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.410\n&gt;&gt; So I'm being honest with you, but\n\n323\n00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:44.205\nI suspect that I don't know.\n\n324\n00:18:44.205 --> 00:18:46.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I suspect it's like, what is this?\n\n325\n00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:48.700\nIs Excel just going, mm mm?\n\n326\n00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:51.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nbecause what does the function do?\n\n327\n00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:55.300\nThe Char only returns it based on.\n\n328\n00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.460\n&gt;&gt; The first character.\n\n329\n00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:04.170\n&gt;&gt; The first character and ANSI, remember\nthe progression of where we went through.\n\n330\n00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:09.380\nWhen we went from ANSI to ASCI and the one\nthat tried to make it all the same was?\n\n331\n00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.280\n&gt;&gt; Unicode.\n\n332\n00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:15.860\n&gt;&gt; Unicode exactly, so that's where\nhere you don't wanna use code,\n\n333\n00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:22.260\nyou wanna use Unicode and\nin Unicode that's where we get that.\n\n334\n00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:28.490\nThat is the value in Unicode and\nthis is where it doesn't understand.\n\n335\n00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:31.130\nIt's just like why,\nwhy can't it give me it?\n\n336\n00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:34.740\nI'm not using care, Char is using what?\n\n337\n00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:40.406\nUni character because I have to be,\nonce you get outside of\n\n338\n00:19:40.406 --> 00:19:45.304\nlike the normal language,\nyou need to, it has limitations.\n\n339\n00:19:45.304 --> 00:19:48.396\nYou need to go to the Unicode or\n\n340\n00:19:48.396 --> 00:19:53.110\nthe Uni character to be\nable to match them up.\n\n341\n00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:56.350\nAnd that is a scary\nlooking cat as opposed to\n\n342\n00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:58.850\nthe cute looking cat\nover here in Macintosh.\n\n343\n00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:02.250\nBut this is where\nthe numbers are the same.\n\n344\n00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:05.280\nOkay, these are going to be the same,\n\n345\n00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:09.200\nbecause we're on unicode and uni\ncharacters, because they're all the same.\n\n346\n00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:15.122\nThey're all platform agnostic, you go\nahead and you use that particular code.\n\n347\n00:20:15.122 --> 00:20:20.155\n[LAUGH] I feel like your eyes\nare glassed over a little.\n\n348\n00:20:20.155 --> 00:20:22.260\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I am churring on a bunch of information\n\n349\n00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:25.800\ncause as much as I've kind of dealt\nwith this in my programmatic role,\n\n350\n00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.871\nI've never actually ran into\nwhere I have platform issues.\n\n351\n00:20:28.871 --> 00:20:32.608\nIt was just a real pain to go\nbetween the two different,\n\n352\n00:20:32.608 --> 00:20:37.850\nbetween ASCI and Unicode you're\nlike well I, it was forced upon me.\n\n353\n00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:42.290\nBut seeing that, woah,\nyou can get differences based on platform,\n\n354\n00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:44.850\nin some programs I'm like Unicode\nall the way, let's do it.\n\n355\n00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:46.860\nEverybody, turn the switch, let's do it.\n\n356\n00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:49.830\n&gt;&gt; See, that's what I have in my notes.\n\n357\n00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:52.960\nThen why would I ever wanna use code or\n\n358\n00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.890\ncharacter if like, unicode is\nencompassing all of that anyways.\n\n359\n00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:00.770\nJust go ahead and unicode, that's totally\nfine, there's nothing wrong with that.\n\n360\n00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:04.411\nAnd it's like, why don't we just\nuse the unicode and uni character,\n\n361\n00:21:04.411 --> 00:21:07.480\nbecause it doesn't corporate everything.\n\n362\n00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:10.360\nAnd it's one of those,\nit kinda depends on what you can remember.\n\n363\n00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:14.450\nLike I know that copyright is 169,\n\n364\n00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:19.900\nI just know that because I've memorized\nit, but if I turned this into Unicode\n\n365\n00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:24.730\nright, that's that particular number.\n\n366\n00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:28.690\nNow that's gonna be the same on\nboth the Mac and PC platform,\n\n367\n00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:33.259\nso everybody knows that the m\ndash is Unicode character 8212.\n\n368\n00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:37.770\nEverybody knows, well that's still 169,\nI remember that, but\n\n369\n00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:40.500\nit's gotten to a, gets to a certain point.\n\n370\n00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:44.750\nSo that's where it gets a little weird and\n\n371\n00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:49.736\nagain, you're like I'm\nnever gonna use this.\n\n372\n00:21:49.736 --> 00:21:54.776\nI get it, again like I promised you,\nthis was all kinda geeky and just,\n\n373\n00:21:54.776 --> 00:21:59.312\nseeing what is behind the scenes\nof our different characters and\n\n374\n00:21:59.312 --> 00:22:03.008\nemojis and\nall these different things that we use and\n\n375\n00:22:03.008 --> 00:22:08.790\nhow we communicate and actually use\nlanguage and syllables to do things.\n\n376\n00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:11.280\nOkay, so that's all these functions do.\n\n377\n00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.800\nBut it's when of like okay\n\"why would I ever use this?\n\n378\n00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:21.428\nwhy are you showing me this?\"\nIt will come into play more than\n\n379\n00:22:21.428 --> 00:22:27.710\nyou might think because of how you\ncan combine with other functions,\n\n380\n00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:33.664\nlike \"I want to find a specific character,\nI wanna find a space or\n\n381\n00:22:33.664 --> 00:22:37.880\nI wanna find that copyright symbol, right?\n\n382\n00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:41.615\nTake all of that out, those different\nthings are like use that as a delimiter,\n\n383\n00:22:41.615 --> 00:22:43.330\nI've using my left or my right.\n\n384\n00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:46.600\nThere are reasons why\nyou're going to use them.\n\n385\n00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.960\nYou might not ever encounter it\nonce you leave this episode.\n\n386\n00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:55.430\nWell you will because I'll make some other\nexamples with it, but just keep it mind,\n\n387\n00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:59.290\nlike for example, one that I've seen\nwhich I think is kind of interesting,\n\n388\n00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:03.390\nis I wanna take these and\nI wanna add a line break.\n\n389\n00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:07.248\nAnd just so\nyou know if I was typing here, blah,\n\n390\n00:23:07.248 --> 00:23:11.303\nblah, blah, blah and I did, hit alt-enter.\n\n391\n00:23:11.303 --> 00:23:17.960\nAlt-enter is going to head and give you\na line break within the cell, right.\n\n392\n00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.060\nNot enter, cuz that goes to the next one.\n\n393\n00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:24.240\nI wanna add a line break, why would I\nwanna take these and I wanna concatenate,\n\n394\n00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.820\nor join, these two cells.\n\n395\n00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:29.097\nAnd I want to add a line\nbreak in between them and\n\n396\n00:23:29.097 --> 00:23:31.710\nthen add a copyright symbol into it.\n\n397\n00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:34.400\nAnd you're like, yeah,\nI would totally do this!\n\n398\n00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.360\nI know, it's just fun to be able\nto show you how to use this.\n\n399\n00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:42.028\nSo, if I want to go with this and\nbefore we start, I know that line break,\n\n400\n00:23:42.028 --> 00:23:43.805\nthe character code is ten.\n\n401\n00:23:43.805 --> 00:23:48.773\nI just know that, can't make excel do that\nI had to actually go in my references and\n\n402\n00:23:48.773 --> 00:23:53.245\nout on to the internet and find what's\nthe character code for line break.\n\n403\n00:23:53.245 --> 00:23:57.353\nThat's one and\nthen I know that the copyright is...\n\n404\n00:23:57.353 --> 00:24:00.553\nCharacter code 169, so\n\n405\n00:24:00.553 --> 00:24:05.421\nif I said, hey let's take hello world and\n\n406\n00:24:05.421 --> 00:24:09.454\nwe will add in a character of 10,\n\n407\n00:24:09.454 --> 00:24:17.240\nthen I want you to add in this cell and\nthen I'd like you to.\n\n408\n00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:22.422\nAdd in a space and then I'd like you\n\n409\n00:24:22.422 --> 00:24:27.255\nto add in a character of 169.\n\n410\n00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.112\nYeah, it didn't work,\n\n411\n00:24:31.112 --> 00:24:35.880\nthat's just cuz you didn't do\nthe text wrap in the cell itself.\n\n412\n00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:39.300\nSo you'd have to actually tell it to wrap\nthe force it to the end of the line cuz\n\n413\n00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:42.450\nremember it's just a character right now.\n\n414\n00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:45.545\nIf it doesn't have word wraps\nit's like I'm just a character.\n\n415\n00:24:45.545 --> 00:24:49.130\nBu,t now I can wrap okay I'll go ahead and\nperform what you want and\n\n416\n00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:51.830\nthen I can center it and\nthen I can pull this down.\n\n417\n00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:57.120\nAnd do something like that,\nso if you need to put in.\n\n418\n00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:01.630\nLine breaks are specific\ncharacters that you cannot\n\n419\n00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:06.630\ntype in when concatenating or\njoining or finding.\n\n420\n00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:08.290\nYou might have to use the character code.\n\n421\n00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:10.410\nAnd the other thing might be,\nI don't know what the code is.\n\n422\n00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:14.650\nSo you might have to type it,\nuse the code function to find the number.\n\n423\n00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:19.635\nThen use the number to add into\nthe character function nested into your\n\n424\n00:25:19.635 --> 00:25:20.999\nother functions.\n\n425\n00:25:20.999 --> 00:25:23.796\n[LAUGH] Yeah, exactly.\n\n426\n00:25:23.796 --> 00:25:27.142\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That was fun, wasn't it?\n\n427\n00:25:27.142 --> 00:25:29.577\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let me tell you.\n\n428\n00:25:29.577 --> 00:25:31.325\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n429\n00:25:31.325 --> 00:25:33.140\n&gt;&gt; And\nit may seem like you wouldn't do this.\n\n430\n00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:36.920\nI actually did a little bit of\ndata munching in previous roles.\n\n431\n00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.135\nThis may be more applicable\nthan you would think.\n\n432\n00:25:39.135 --> 00:25:42.303\nKinda have some raw text I need\nto like [SOUND] like slice and\n\n433\n00:25:42.303 --> 00:25:43.926\ndice and put these in here.\n\n434\n00:25:43.926 --> 00:25:47.330\nWoah, well that's an odd character,\nit's got this little box in here.\n\n435\n00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:50.925\nI got to do some introspection,\nwhat is this doing?\n\n436\n00:25:50.925 --> 00:25:54.585\nSo these could come in handy especially\nif you're doing in a text processing or\n\n437\n00:25:54.585 --> 00:25:56.005\nsomething like that.\n\n438\n00:25:56.005 --> 00:26:00.195\nOr even maybe you're getting messages\nfrom a network interface and you want to\n\n439\n00:26:00.195 --> 00:26:04.915\nanalyze them with Excel you may still\nneed these, its particular use cases.\n\n440\n00:26:04.915 --> 00:26:08.854\nBut I can think maybe of it's a little\nmore cases you're probably not going\n\n441\n00:26:08.854 --> 00:26:10.552\nto use this for invoicing then.\n\n442\n00:26:10.552 --> 00:26:14.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and that's where,\nlike you said, the edge cases.\n\n443\n00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:18.780\nAnd again, you might see, it might come\nback around later and your like yeah,\n\n444\n00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:23.270\nI remember talking,\nmom loves to geek out about this stuff so,\n\n445\n00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:25.180\nnow I can see where it comes into play.\n\n446\n00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:29.694\nAnd yeah, antiquated systems,\nold systems that use some weird stuff,\n\n447\n00:26:29.694 --> 00:26:30.809\nit might happen.\n\n448\n00:26:30.809 --> 00:26:34.885\nThere's one more example that I do\nactually find kind of cute, okay.\n\n449\n00:26:34.885 --> 00:26:39.772\nBecause I like cute stuff and different\nways to just find some weird edge\n\n450\n00:26:39.772 --> 00:26:43.790\ncase scenario of why you would do this,\nall right.\n\n451\n00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:47.980\nCustom lists, we did an episode where\nI asked what your pets' names were and\n\n452\n00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:52.140\nyou gave me Sparky and somebody else,\nI just remember Sparky.\n\n453\n00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:54.710\nSo when it comes up, I just type it in,\n\n454\n00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:58.220\nI type in Justin, auto fill down,\nthose are custom lists.\n\n455\n00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:01.660\nWell, so I could go ahead and\ntype in like one, go ahead and\n\n456\n00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:05.330\nuse my lists and then I could fill it in.\n\n457\n00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:06.910\nI want to fill a series, right?\n\n458\n00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:11.552\nI could also do Monday, Tuesday,\nWednesday and go ahead, oops, hello.\n\n459\n00:27:11.552 --> 00:27:13.597\nLet's go ahead and fill that down and\nit's gonna go ahead and\n\n460\n00:27:13.597 --> 00:27:15.200\nfill in the days of the week.\n\n461\n00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.080\nWell we can do numbers,\nbut what about letters?\n\n462\n00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:21.852\nWhat if I take letters and be like, hey, I\nwanna go ahead and fill down, do A, B, C,\n\n463\n00:27:21.852 --> 00:27:22.503\nD, E, F, G.\n\n464\n00:27:22.503 --> 00:27:24.210\nIt doesn't do that, does it?\n\n465\n00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:25.331\nNope, guess what?\n\n466\n00:27:25.331 --> 00:27:28.840\nWe could use the fun little\ncharacter codes and stuff.\n\n467\n00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:32.200\nI always do that to try and\ndo my undo for Ctrl+z.\n\n468\n00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:38.609\nWe can use a combination of these to\nmake a custom list that does A and\n\n469\n00:27:38.609 --> 00:27:44.903\ndrag on that all the way to Z but\nI do know that the character code for\n\n470\n00:27:44.903 --> 00:27:50.346\na uppercase A is 65, wait,\nwhy is that not working?\n\n471\n00:27:50.346 --> 00:27:54.975\nWait [LAUGH] that needs to be code,\nthere we go I needed the code number for\n\n472\n00:27:54.975 --> 00:27:57.150\nthe letter a, I know it's 65.\n\n473\n00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:04.340\nSo I can take 65 just typing it in, pull\nthis on down, fill this in with a series.\n\n474\n00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:07.027\nOkay I need to go down to 26,\n\n475\n00:28:07.027 --> 00:28:12.632\ncuz that would get to z wouldn't it,\nso row 26 25, 26.\n\n476\n00:28:12.632 --> 00:28:17.940\nThere we go, so, 1 through 26, so, these\nare just filling in a series of numbers.\n\n477\n00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:26.150\nNow, I will say give me the character for\nhere and then that's my A.\n\n478\n00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:31.790\nUsing my relative reference or\nmy character function\n\n479\n00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:35.120\nisn't this cute okay I\nknown it's adorable.\n\n480\n00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:40.660\nSo now I've got A through Z just like\na lot of our episodes talk about,\n\n481\n00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:42.660\nthis is the result of a function.\n\n482\n00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:45.740\nThis is not the actual letter A,\nthe letter W.\n\n483\n00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:50.270\nSo fun little shortcut, right click drag.\n\n484\n00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:53.740\nI'm right clicking,\nholding, dragging one, or\n\n485\n00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:56.980\nhow ever many spaces over them,\nright back over itself,\n\n486\n00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:00.680\nto get the contextual menu that'll\nallow me to copy here as values.\n\n487\n00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:05.520\nAnd you can copy and paste in place with\nit as values up here at the clipboard.\n\n488\n00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.000\nNow, it's just letters.\n\n489\n00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.370\nWhile its selected, I can come into file,\nI can go into options I can go to\n\n490\n00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:17.870\nadvanced, I can come down\nhere to my custom list.\n\n491\n00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:18.830\nWhere are you.\n\n492\n00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:19.550\nThere it is.\n\n493\n00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:21.620\nDown there in the general.\n\n494\n00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:22.530\nEdit my custom list.\n\n495\n00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:26.940\nSince it's already seeing that\nI have cells selected in here.\n\n496\n00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:30.570\nThat's where I can just say,\ngo ahead and bring this on in.\n\n497\n00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:36.922\nNow I have created a custom list\nthat I can come over to here and\n\n498\n00:29:36.922 --> 00:29:42.902\nsay hey, here's the letter A and\nthen I pull it on down and\n\n499\n00:29:42.902 --> 00:29:49.906\nI've got a custom list with A, B,\nC, D, E, F, G and so much fun.\n\n500\n00:29:49.906 --> 00:29:50.596\nI don't know.\n\n501\n00:29:50.596 --> 00:29:51.696\nI am singing.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHTER]\n\n502\n00:29:51.696 --> 00:29:52.440\n&gt;&gt; I'll tell you what.\n\n503\n00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:54.960\nWe're going to have to\nget you calmed down,\n\n504\n00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:58.060\nbecause you're in some sort of\nfugue state where you black out,\n\n505\n00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:02.240\nlike a character sensor [LAUGHTER] See\nthen I'm like I don't know what happened.\n\n506\n00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:02.920\n&gt;&gt; I know!\n\n507\n00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:04.551\n&gt;&gt; That is pretty cool though-\n&gt;&gt; It's fun.\n\n508\n00:30:04.551 --> 00:30:06.900\n&gt;&gt; Can you imagine typing A, B, C, D and\n\n509\n00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:10.797\nthen correspondingly they should\nbe lower case letter ones and\n\n510\n00:30:10.797 --> 00:30:15.003\nif you want a lowercase list you can\ndo apply to the exact same thing.\n\n511\n00:30:15.003 --> 00:30:19.300\nFor some reason the only thing I can\nthink of is substitutional ciphers.\n\n512\n00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:23.510\nWhere I can look up the character code and\nshift it by some amount, or do a replace\n\n513\n00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:26.800\nthrough some kind of mathematical\noperation to get it back down.\n\n514\n00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.916\nI don't know what, that's not something\nyou would normally build in Excel, but\n\n515\n00:30:29.916 --> 00:30:33.280\nI was like, yeah, I can do that,\njust knowing these few functions.\n\n516\n00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:38.010\n&gt;&gt; It's just a fun little thing of how\nto apply in a real-world scenario,\n\n517\n00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:39.670\nlike how you'd ever use it.\n\n518\n00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:40.220\nThere it is.\n\n519\n00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:43.130\nIt's a Wrinkles, Frisky, Aurora and Texas.\n\n520\n00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:47.540\nJust wanted to show you in Mac where you\ngo to get and edit your custom list.\n\n521\n00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:51.750\nThe same exact procedure, you just\nneed to go into your preferences and\n\n522\n00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:55.590\nfrom preferences, that's where you go\ninto custom lists and you can add it in.\n\n523\n00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:58.800\nYeah, I was doing the Excel for Mac series\nwhen we were talking about your pets.\n\n524\n00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:03.649\nOkay, so I just wanted to show you the two\ndifferent operating systems of how you can\n\n525\n00:31:03.649 --> 00:31:07.526\nuse some fun with characters, okay,\nyou just need to stop being so\n\n526\n00:31:07.526 --> 00:31:09.082\nI'm going to keep going.\n\n527\n00:31:09.082 --> 00:31:12.100\n&gt;&gt; All right I'm going to have to calm you\ndown and we're going to have to cool off\n\n528\n00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:16.830\nafter this episode come on, see,\nit's infectious, well it should be so\n\n529\n00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:19.980\ninfectious that should come on back,\nthat would be a smart move.\n\n530\n00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:21.750\nBut for now we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n531\n00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:24.660\nSo signing off for Office Pro TV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n532\n00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:25.330\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n533\n00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:27.821\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n534\n00:31:27.821 --> 00:31:31.623\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

another exciting\nepisode of Office Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:17.160\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and\n\n5\n00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.020\nwe're back with more Excel functions and\nwell don't replace your set,\n\n6\n00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.780\nthere's no substitute for\nthe wonderful things that are to come.\n\n7\n00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.570\nAnd actually speaking of that that's what\nwe're gonna be doing in this episode.\n\n8\n00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.580\nAnd here to help us along in that very\nendeavor, this is Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.884\nHow are you doing today Vonne?\n&gt;&gt; I\n\n10\n00:00:30.884 --> 00:00:31.648\nlove your introductions!\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n11\n00:00:31.648 --> 00:00:33.430\n&gt;&gt; They just make me smile!\n\n12\n00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.290\n&gt;&gt; It's like a game.\n\n13\n00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.730\nI don't know.\nIt's like, can I somehow weed this in?\n\n14\n00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:37.480\nI don't now.\n\n15\n00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.060\nI find them funny.\n\n16\n00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.340\nOther people may not.\n&gt;&gt; I\n\n17\n00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.580\nfind them hilarious.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n18\n00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.630\n&gt;&gt; So I'm over here trying not to laugh\n\n19\n00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.330\neverytime, but you are correct.\n\n20\n00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.545\nWe are not, there is no substitution for\nwhat we are gonna talk about.\n\n21\n00:00:50.545 --> 00:00:52.590\n[LAUGH] I can't do it as good as you.\n\n22\n00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.840\nWe're going to talk about the replace and\nthe substitute functions in Excel.\n\n23\n00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.450\nOkay what does that mean?\n\n24\n00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.470\nExactly what they say.\n\n25\n00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.160\nI want to replace, some text.\n\n26\n00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.830\nThis is part of our text functions or\n\n27\n00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.700\nreally just,\nwe just want to replace something, okay?\n\n28\n00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.680\nSo I want to replace something\nwith something else, okay?\n\n29\n00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.820\nI want to substitute one thing for\nanother.\n\n30\n00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.318\nSounds kinda like the same, don't they?\n\n31\n00:01:21.318 --> 00:01:26.170\nYeah, okay and also by themselves you\n\n32\n00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.260\nmight be like, great, what do we do?\n\n33\n00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.270\nJust like so many of my other episodes,\nyou're gonna combine them.\n\n34\n00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.640\nBut again,\nwe need to learn what is this by itself?\n\n35\n00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.260\nUnderstand it, so that way,\nwhen we go a little bit further and\n\n36\n00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.630\nput it into other functions and\nnest things, it will make sense to us.\n\n37\n00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.390\nSo let's start,\nI have a website that just went ahead and\n\n38\n00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.550\npulled up the support files,\ncuz it has documentation on all of these.\n\n39\n00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.810\nREPLACE, there is a REPLACEB.\n\n40\n00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.420\nWe notice this in some other ones,\nwhere it's talking about all right,\n\n41\n00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.150\nare we talking about characters.\n\n42\n00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:14.020\nThat's the replace or\nbytes of information and replace\n\n43\n00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.180\nb is intended to be used with languages\nthat use double byte character sets.\n\n44\n00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.820\nAnd this is where we really normally find\nthat in such languages like Japanese,\n\n45\n00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.540\nChinese and Korean.\n\n46\n00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.820\nSo that's where we're going to find\nthose particular types of Languages and\n\n47\n00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.320\ncharacter sets.\n\n48\n00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.600\nSo just know that you\nwould need to do that and\n\n49\n00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.480\nit also means that your\ncomputer is already installed.\n\n50\n00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.290\nAnd uses that as the default language for\nyou operating system.\n\n51\n00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.540\nWe're gonna concentrate on the replace and\nthen substitute, same idea.\n\n52\n00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.170\nIt's just gonna go ahead and\nsubstitute the new text for the old text.\n\n53\n00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.330\nCool.\n\n54\n00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.570\nAnd the other one was again,\nreplaces parts of a tax trade.\n\n55\n00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.080\nSee, it's pretty straightforward and\nthey seem to be exactly the same.\n\n56\n00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.290\nBut with a few slight variations.\n\n57\n00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.420\nSo why don't we see it.\n\n58\n00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.110\nHave a file, replace and substitute.\n\n59\n00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.000\nI have some item numbers, okay.\n\n60\n00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.030\nSo we're here.\n\n61\n00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.390\nMaybe this is for\na Christmas Cats Incorporated, all right.\n\n62\n00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.500\nAnd we have this item number.\n\n63\n00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.370\nAnd we realize that we\nneed to change all of\n\n64\n00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.810\nthe Christmas Cats Incorporated\nover to Dancing Dogs Company,\n\n65\n00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.380\nbecause that's what we use for\nour databases and everything like that.\n\n66\n00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.470\nSo I would like to replace\nanytime you see CCI with DDC.\n\n67\n00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.840\nCool, let's use the function to do it.\n\n68\n00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.640\nPut my cursor or\nselect a cell that I want.\n\n69\n00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.530\nI hit the Insert Function dialog box.\n\n70\n00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.680\nMine's already in my most recently used,\nbut\n\n71\n00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.460\nyou know you can always type into the go.\n\n72\n00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.110\nType in replace, hit go and\nthen it will give you them.\n\n73\n00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.000\nOr you can go ahead and\n\n74\n00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.360\ntry and find the category it is,\nI don't always remember which ones there.\n\n75\n00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.800\nIt is a text function, so you can\ngo ahead and find it in that group.\n\n76\n00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.088\nWe're just going to click OK.\n\n77\n00:03:59.088 --> 00:04:01.470\nOr double-click on it.\n\n78\n00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.990\nHere we go!\n\n79\n00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.790\nThe old text that you want\nto replace some characters.\n\n80\n00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.430\nSo what am I looking at?\n\n81\n00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.870\nI want you to look at\nthis particular cell.\n\n82\n00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.370\nAnd it's pulling in, okay great,\nI see that as a string of text.\n\n83\n00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.220\nTell me where you want to start?\n\n84\n00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.220\nSo the start is the position\nof the character\n\n85\n00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.650\nin the old text that you want\nto replace with new text.\n\n86\n00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.240\nNow this is one you do have to count.\n\n87\n00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.180\nIf I look at this.\n\n88\n00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:33.990\nC starts at one, two, three,\nfour, that's the dash, five.\n\n89\n00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:41.410\nFive is the starting position that I\nwould like you to start replacing.\n\n90\n00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:49.200\nHow many characters in, the number of\ncharacters, that I want to replace.\n\n91\n00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.298\nWell in this sense, I'd like to replace 3.\n\n92\n00:04:52.298 --> 00:04:56.886\nAnd the three characters\nthat I would like to\n\n93\n00:04:56.886 --> 00:05:01.230\nreplace it with is going to be DDC, okay?\n\n94\n00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.120\nYeah, it seems like, all right, well, that\nseems like a lot just to replace this and\n\n95\n00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.110\nthat sounds great.\n\n96\n00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.800\nEverything is uniform, right?\n\n97\n00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.680\nBecause if I take this and copy it down.\n\n98\n00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.960\nThat's fine okay but then down here,\nlet me zoom out a little bit.\n\n99\n00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.050\nThese have different preceding numbers.\n\n100\n00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.546\nSo position five is in\ndifferent place here, right?\n\n101\n00:05:26.546 --> 00:05:30.254\nSo if I took this and\ncopied it down to here,\n\n102\n00:05:30.254 --> 00:05:34.810\nthen that kind of puts\nit all out of whack.\n\n103\n00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.730\nGreat for uniformity.\n\n104\n00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:41.900\nNot so great for non uniformity or\nvariable lengths of text.\n\n105\n00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.220\nIt's like, that seems kind of weird.\n\n106\n00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.050\nIt's not always going\nto be set up that way.\n\n107\n00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.730\nI know.\n\n108\n00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:47.690\nThat's okay.\n\n109\n00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.990\nBut, when it is set up great,\nit can be used pretty straightforward.\n\n110\n00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.440\nAnd also notice, look what it treated\nwith null values or not null.\n\n111\n00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.200\nJust blank cells.\n\n112\n00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.550\nI go ahead and put the DDC in there.\n\n113\n00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.050\nAlright, again, just what are the\nlimitations of this, what does it do.\n\n114\n00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.720\nIt's looking at the text,\nit starting at position five.\n\n115\n00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.240\nLooking at three characters,\nand replacing those\n\n116\n00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.560\nparticular three characters.\n&gt;&gt; Now, Vonne,\n\n117\n00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.150\nI do have a question about it.\n\n118\n00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.960\nThe DDC from the blank,\nthat kind of answers part of it.\n\n119\n00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.790\nSo, I start at five, you said three,\nbecause I had three characters to replace.\n\n120\n00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.410\nBut if I said the number\nof characters is three, but\n\n121\n00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:29.540\nthen I had six things to\nactually substitute in there,\n\n122\n00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.430\nget rid of those three and and\nsplice in those six characters,\n\n123\n00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.601\nso if I put DDC DDC.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm,\n\n124\n00:06:36.601 --> 00:06:41.300\nlet's go up to here let's\ngo to the top one okay?\n\n125\n00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:47.405\nAnd you're saying that's six\ncharacters but this number is three.\n\n126\n00:06:47.405 --> 00:06:52.044\nLet's see It basically\ncompletely ignores you.\n\n127\n00:06:52.044 --> 00:06:55.047\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so it's gonna start at five,\n\n128\n00:06:55.047 --> 00:06:57.910\nit's gonna cut out the next three.\n\n129\n00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.310\nAnd after it cuts those two pieces,\n\n130\n00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:02.740\nit's gonna take the replacement, stack\nthem in there and squish it back together.\n\n131\n00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.446\nIt's like It's like you're\npeeling onions off a sandwich and\n\n132\n00:07:05.446 --> 00:07:07.804\nyou're adding more meat in the process or\nsomething.\n\n133\n00:07:07.804 --> 00:07:08.932\nI don't know.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n134\n00:07:08.932 --> 00:07:13.720\nthat actually kinda you're making\nan interesting argument that that three.\n\n135\n00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.850\nI told it three characters,\nbut I put six of them in.\n\n136\n00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:18.130\nIt's like, well, I'm just gonna go ahead.\n\n137\n00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:18.875\nWhat if I put in 1?\n\n138\n00:07:18.875 --> 00:07:24.516\nOkay, so, but there's an I.\n\n139\n00:07:24.516 --> 00:07:30.390\nAnd there's a 1, 2-DDCDDCCI.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n140\n00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:33.040\n&gt;&gt; Okay, now when we go the other way,\n\n141\n00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:38.050\nthey said just that one character,\nI only want you to go one,\n\n142\n00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:41.670\nso it's only looking at that first C.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it slices that on it.\n\n143\n00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.890\nWhat if we put a zero only?\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's try it, okay.\n\n144\n00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:51.334\nThen it keeps it.\n&gt;&gt; So then it's not really a place.\n\n145\n00:07:51.334 --> 00:07:54.375\nIf you're putting a zero in there, it's\nnot, it's like, I'm just shove that it\n\n146\n00:07:54.375 --> 00:07:57.980\nin the middle right there.\n&gt;&gt; It's funny because look at the example\n\n147\n00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.246\nof Replace the ad.\n\n148\n00:07:59.246 --> 00:08:03.157\n[LAUGH] So, I kind of gave away\na little bit of another example of\n\n149\n00:08:03.157 --> 00:08:05.210\nwhere you might wanna use this.\n\n150\n00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:06.110\nBut that's okay.\n\n151\n00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:09.170\nI have no problem because it was\njust a nice train of thought\n\n152\n00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:11.290\nof where we were going.\n\n153\n00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:13.480\nHow does this function actually work.\n\n154\n00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.960\nAnd Justin's the best at this because he\nsometimes throws me for loops where 'm\n\n155\n00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:22.520\nscared of what he's gonna ask cuz I'm not\nsure if I tested it to that limit there.\n\n156\n00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:28.220\nBut we are seeing how it's working so\nI appreciate that Justin there.\n\n157\n00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.320\nAnd now we can see what it's doing.\n\n158\n00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.405\nSo I'm going to tell you to hold your\nthought if you have any more questions,\n\n159\n00:08:34.405 --> 00:08:40.090\ncuz let's just look at the substitute and\nsee how this particular one works for now.\n\n160\n00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:44.540\nOkay so substitute is very similar, okay?\n\n161\n00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:48.040\nSo let's go ahead and bring this in and\nwe're going to get the function.\n\n162\n00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.460\nAnd we're going to look at this string.\n\n163\n00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:56.200\nSo now what I'd like to say is I\nwould like to look at the old text.\n\n164\n00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.680\nAnd by the way,\nI'm using the insert function dialog box.\n\n165\n00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.140\nSo anytime you're using text,\nyou wanna put it in strings.\n\n166\n00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.210\nThe nice thing it does it for me.\n\n167\n00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:07.260\nSo our site quotes to go ahead and\ncreate a string.\n\n168\n00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:13.578\nI want you to find CCI and\nI would like you to replace it with DDC.\n\n169\n00:09:13.578 --> 00:09:16.326\nDon't worry about the answers\nto number four right now,\n\n170\n00:09:16.326 --> 00:09:19.430\nit's optional variable\nbecause it's not bold.\n\n171\n00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:22.016\nI click OK and it did it.\n\n172\n00:09:22.016 --> 00:09:26.230\nTotally fine and\nit pulls down and that's fine.\n\n173\n00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:30.480\nAnd if we keep on going, let's zoom\nout a little bit and I pull this down.\n\n174\n00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:32.960\nThen that's kinda nice.\n\n175\n00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.750\nIt doesn't matter about\nthe variable length of text\n\n176\n00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:38.390\ncuz you're being very specific.\n\n177\n00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:41.210\nFind CCI and replace it with DDC.\n\n178\n00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:43.310\nThat's exactly what I want you to do.\n\n179\n00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:46.841\nDon't worry about where it's\nat in the actual string.\n\n180\n00:09:46.841 --> 00:09:54.510\nCool, one little thing, little gotcha,\nthat's a little too much.\n\n181\n00:09:54.510 --> 00:10:02.030\nCCI, right, capital DDC, what if I changed\nthis, remember, it was CC to begin with.\n\n182\n00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.470\nOops, sorry, I'm hitting the wrong keys.\n\n183\n00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.460\nLowercase c and lowercase i, Justin,\n\n184\n00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.210\nwhat do you think is gonna happen?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n185\n00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:15.650\nbased on previous experience with Excel,\nit should be case non specific,\n\n186\n00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:21.140\ncase insensitive, but it just showed me.\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n187\n00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.230\n&gt;&gt; I don't like when this happens.\n\n188\n00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:25.760\nBut I actually understand behind\nthe scenes, so the way it's searching for\n\n189\n00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:31.140\nthat pattern, it has to dilineate between\nupper case and lower case letters.\n\n190\n00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:32.800\nBut the fact that that doesn't occur and\n\n191\n00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.840\na bunch of different functions\ncan lead to some, man.\n\n192\n00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.430\nWhy is that not working like I thought?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n193\n00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:41.880\nwhy are you doing it this time and\nnot the other?\n\n194\n00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:47.010\nAnd it's not uniform so\nthat's a little but\n\n195\n00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:51.050\nyou know what it does and so it can't\nreplace cuz doesn't see it the same way.\n\n196\n00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:56.730\nSo it is case specific and\nit does have to be an exact match for\n\n197\n00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:59.960\nit to find what you want.\n\n198\n00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:03.340\nSo that's what the functions do.\n\n199\n00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:07.040\nCouple different variations\njust to have some fun.\n\n200\n00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.090\nWe already kinda eluded to this\nis that you can use replace add.\n\n201\n00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:14.790\nNow give me a scenario like\na real world scenario.\n\n202\n00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:18.440\nSay these are our item numbers for\nChristmas Cats Incorporated and\n\n203\n00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:23.500\nthat when we send it to\nthe Jacksonville Processing Plant or\n\n204\n00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:29.770\nwhatever that it needs to have\nthat J-A-X into the item number.\n\n205\n00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:34.487\nBut what we can say is I wanna\nadd this is an extra sequence in\n\n206\n00:11:34.487 --> 00:11:37.101\nour item number before the CCI.\n\n207\n00:11:37.101 --> 00:11:41.066\nSo kinda threw it away that whole zero and\neverything that we did,\n\n208\n00:11:41.066 --> 00:11:45.270\nlet's just do it again so\nwe can kind of bring it all back.\n\n209\n00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:47.482\nWe are gonna replace,\nbut not really replace.\n\n210\n00:11:47.482 --> 00:11:49.940\nWe're gonna take this string of text.\n\n211\n00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:53.990\nWe are gonna start at one,\ntwo, three, four, five.\n\n212\n00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:57.720\nCuz after the first dash,\nso start at five.\n\n213\n00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:01.110\nThe number of characters,\nwe're gonna change is zero.\n\n214\n00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:08.990\nWe don't wanna change anything, and\nI'd like you to add a dash, J-A-X.\n\n215\n00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:13.700\nAnd so what it's going to do is,\ndo I need that other dash?\n\n216\n00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:15.350\nLet's see what happens.\n\n217\n00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:20.080\nOkay, there's a little fiberodo.\n\n218\n00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.000\nSo let's go ahead and go back to here.\n\n219\n00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.210\nWe want to have this start at five and\nwe want to put it on the other end.\n\n220\n00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.305\nThere we go.\n\n221\n00:12:28.305 --> 00:12:29.937\nThat looks right.\n\n222\n00:12:29.937 --> 00:12:32.010\nThere we go, that's what I wanted to do.\n\n223\n00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:34.410\nSo then it goes ahead and adds it in.\n\n224\n00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:35.660\nBut just like before,\n\n225\n00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:40.250\nwe kinda noticed that if I have\nvariable lengths in the beginning,\n\n226\n00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:45.590\nit's gonna still start at five,\nnot replace anything, and then add it in.\n\n227\n00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:52.200\nSo different lengths of item numbers,\nor text it's gonna get weird.\n\n228\n00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:56.960\nYou add it in with other functions,\nand everything will get all the right\n\n229\n00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:01.680\nway once you extend it out to\nusing the lens and the finds,\n\n230\n00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.350\nand all fun stuff, so,\nother episodes to come.\n\n231\n00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.640\nAnother one, so,\nsubstitute to change syntax.\n\n232\n00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:11.130\nWe wanna change all of them.\n\n233\n00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:14.087\nSo we would use these, substitute, okay?\n\n234\n00:13:14.087 --> 00:13:16.770\nSo we'd go with substitute, take this.\n\n235\n00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:18.050\nNo, that's the wrong one.\n\n236\n00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:19.282\nI clicked on the wrong one, didn't I?\n\n237\n00:13:19.282 --> 00:13:20.121\n[LAUGH] Thank you.\n\n238\n00:13:20.121 --> 00:13:21.013\nI saw Justin go uh-uh.\n\n239\n00:13:21.013 --> 00:13:23.090\n[LAUGH] Wrong one, Vonne.\n\n240\n00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:23.640\nThere we go.\n\n241\n00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:27.870\nSo we're going to take this\none the old text is a dash,\n\n242\n00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:29.680\nit's gonna put the quotes around it.\n\n243\n00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:34.050\nI'd like it to be a space,\nforward slash, space,\n\n244\n00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:41.180\nand then it goes ahead and\nreplaces all my dashes with slashes.\n\n245\n00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.360\nKind of cool.\n\n246\n00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:47.160\nBut what if I wanted to then,\nI'm going to select this text,\n\n247\n00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:53.020\nI'm going to copy this function,\nusing the right key.\n\n248\n00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:56.940\nAnd then escape and then I'm going\nto double click and then paste,\n\n249\n00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.770\nthat way it's not gonna use the relative\nreference cuz I'm double clicking\n\n250\n00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:03.820\ninto it to type in the text, and\nthen I'm going to bring into the function.\n\n251\n00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:08.030\nDialogue box, so that was just kind of\nshortcut ways of doing the same thing.\n\n252\n00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:10.650\nBut the instance number,\nthat's the one I wanna talk about.\n\n253\n00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:12.670\nBecause what I really wanna do is,\n\n254\n00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:18.310\nI really wanna change the second\ninstance of the slash.\n\n255\n00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:21.180\nI wanted to keep the dash.\n\n256\n00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:22.430\nI'm sorry, dash for slash.\n\n257\n00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:26.000\nWhoo, I should have chose some other\ndelimiters there, shouldn't I, Justin?\n\n258\n00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.070\nSo I wanna change it at\ninstance number two, okay?\n\n259\n00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:31.420\nSo let's look at what that does.\n\n260\n00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:36.950\nOkay, so the first dash is gonna say.\n\n261\n00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:42.510\nThe second one, the second instance of\nthe dash is gonna change to a slash,\n\n262\n00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:44.600\nand then the other one is\ngoing to remain a dash.\n\n263\n00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.070\nSo you can then pick and\n\n264\n00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:51.960\nchoose at which instance that that\nparticular string or character occurs.\n\n265\n00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:56.030\nAnd that gives you a little\nbit more pinpoint accuracy,\n\n266\n00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:59.200\nif you wanna say, of where you would\nlike to replace this character.\n\n267\n00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:00.780\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne,\n\n268\n00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:04.240\nwhat if I wanted to replace the second and\nthird instance, but not the first?\n\n269\n00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.420\nIs there any possible way\nto do that in substitute?\n\n270\n00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:08.550\n&gt;&gt; You can,\n\n271\n00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:13.340\njust we would have to keep going.\n&gt;&gt; I was hoping we could do something like\n\n272\n00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.920\ntwo comma, like in quotes or\n\n273\n00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.860\nsomething like two comma three.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's gonna give\n\n274\n00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:24.360\nus a nope we can't do that.\n&gt;&gt; What if we put that as a string?\n\n275\n00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.020\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; The-\n\n276\n00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.020\n&gt;&gt; Quotes around the two and\n\n277\n00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:27.650\nthe three.\n&gt;&gt; Pretty sure that's not gonna\n\n278\n00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:28.310\nwork either.\n\n279\n00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:30.970\nLet me go ahead and make sure that quote.\n\n280\n00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.660\nLet's get the arrow key to\nwork the proper way, and\n\n281\n00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:39.710\nthen, that's what you're asking, right?\n\n282\n00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:41.820\nOkay, nope,\nit doesn't understand that either.\n\n283\n00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.130\n&gt;&gt; What if we put a -1 in there?\n\n284\n00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.200\nCan we do the last one?\n&gt;&gt; Whoa.\n\n285\n00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.100\nThat, no.\n&gt;&gt; It's still a string.\n\n286\n00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:50.871\nWhat if we make it a number?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n287\n00:15:50.871 --> 00:15:53.055\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Not trying to throw you over\n\n288\n00:15:53.055 --> 00:15:54.615\nthe rails here.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n289\n00:15:54.615 --> 00:15:57.733\nnow this is the instance number, okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so the instance number,\n\n290\n00:15:57.733 --> 00:15:59.378\nwe don't want that to be a string.\n\n291\n00:15:59.378 --> 00:16:00.980\nWe were trying some strings there.\n\n292\n00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:01.751\nWhat if we put in a negative one?\n\n293\n00:16:01.751 --> 00:16:04.975\nDo we have one come back from the other\n\n294\n00:16:04.975 --> 00:16:07.837\nside?\n&gt;&gt; See how it's putting the negative one\n\n295\n00:16:07.837 --> 00:16:09.842\nin quoations?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n296\n00:16:09.842 --> 00:16:12.242\nWell, you want to explain\nthe negative one,\n\n297\n00:16:12.242 --> 00:16:13.271\nby the way?\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n298\n00:16:13.271 --> 00:16:16.110\nthere's some things that I do\nwhere you go negative one, and\n\n299\n00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:19.520\nyou actually start at the right-hand\nside and left or right languages.\n\n300\n00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.090\nAnd you come backwards from that side.\n\n301\n00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:25.533\nSo negative one would be the first one\nfrom the right instead of the first one\n\n302\n00:16:25.533 --> 00:16:26.252\nfrom the left.\n\n303\n00:16:26.252 --> 00:16:28.751\nSo I was hoping maybe instead\nof going I want the sixth one,\n\n304\n00:16:28.751 --> 00:16:32.710\nwhich is sometimes over, actually I\njust want the first one from this side.\n\n305\n00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:33.659\nSo you can get rid of the, I was trying.\n\n306\n00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:37.497\nEh, trying.\n&gt;&gt; I am not saying that you can't do this,\n\n307\n00:16:37.497 --> 00:16:37.999\nokay?\n\n308\n00:16:37.999 --> 00:16:43.940\nBut for the scope of this particular\nlesson we're gonna be like,\n\n309\n00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:47.770\nnot without a little tweaky, okay?\n\n310\n00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:49.873\nIt's possible, totally is.\n\n311\n00:16:49.873 --> 00:16:55.210\nBut we're gonna just say,\nwe'll do another one with that one.\n\n312\n00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:58.809\n[LAUGH] So that's where we could go\nahead and use the change only for\n\n313\n00:16:58.809 --> 00:17:00.064\nthat particular one.\n\n314\n00:17:00.064 --> 00:17:03.917\nLet's get back to where we changed\nthe middle dash to a slash.\n\n315\n00:17:03.917 --> 00:17:04.580\nOkay.\n\n316\n00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:09.055\nFun.\nAnd these are just pulling it down to just\n\n317\n00:17:09.055 --> 00:17:13.780\nshow you that if you took both of these\nand copied it down, that again, that\n\n318\n00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:18.960\nvariable length of text for the first set\nof numbers, or sequence in these items.\n\n319\n00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:21.297\nAnd is not gonna be that big of a deal.\n\n320\n00:17:21.297 --> 00:17:25.150\nSo just a couple examples of\nwhere you might wanna do this.\n\n321\n00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:29.067\nDo remember that all of these\nare going to be results of functions.\n\n322\n00:17:29.067 --> 00:17:32.971\nSo if you were going to be\nusing this somewhere else,\n\n323\n00:17:32.971 --> 00:17:37.672\na lot of times we use these functions\nto go ahead and get a value,\n\n324\n00:17:37.672 --> 00:17:43.000\nreturn something, and I wanna use\nit as a value, not as the function.\n\n325\n00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.956\nSo when I copy and paste this into\nanother worksheet or another workbook,\n\n326\n00:17:45.956 --> 00:17:49.195\nyou're gonna get that reference there,\nit's gonna be, I don't understand,\n\n327\n00:17:49.195 --> 00:17:51.263\ncuz it doesn't see this\nas this particular value.\n\n328\n00:17:51.263 --> 00:17:57.069\nSo you copy it, and when I copy, and\nif I want to keep it in the same place,\n\n329\n00:17:57.069 --> 00:18:00.830\nyou just paste it as values right over it.\n\n330\n00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:03.988\nNow if you're going and\nputting it in another worksheet,\n\n331\n00:18:03.988 --> 00:18:07.273\nyou would already go ahead and\nuse like the smart tags to say,\n\n332\n00:18:07.273 --> 00:18:10.772\nno I wanna paste these as values,\nand you will be fine with that.\n\n333\n00:18:10.772 --> 00:18:12.499\nBut we are gonna go ahead and paste and\n\n334\n00:18:12.499 --> 00:18:15.410\nplace because I wanted to actually\nuse something of the data.\n\n335\n00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:18.036\nGood thing.\n\n336\n00:18:18.036 --> 00:18:22.915\nThis is one where,\nisn't this just like Find and Replace?\n\n337\n00:18:22.915 --> 00:18:30.525\nLike the Find, the Find and Replace that\nwe use in Word or Excel or anything?\n\n338\n00:18:30.525 --> 00:18:33.620\nI'm like, how is this not that?\n\n339\n00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:36.473\nYou're kind of right, okay?\n\n340\n00:18:36.473 --> 00:18:40.730\nIn certain situations\nit is the same thing.\n\n341\n00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:44.148\nBack on this one when we said,\nwe'll go ahead and find CCI and\n\n342\n00:18:44.148 --> 00:18:45.365\nreplace it with DDC.\n\n343\n00:18:45.365 --> 00:18:47.662\nWhy didn't I just use the font and say,\n\n344\n00:18:47.662 --> 00:18:51.500\nwithin this worksheet go ahead\nfind all instances and change it?\n\n345\n00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.924\nYeah, that's exactly what you could do.\n\n346\n00:18:54.924 --> 00:18:56.060\nNothing wrong with that.\n\n347\n00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:59.858\nSo I don't know about any of you all\nout there are thinking the same thing,\n\n348\n00:18:59.858 --> 00:19:03.838\nbecause when I learned about these\nfunctions, I'm like [SOUND] as their own,\n\n349\n00:19:03.838 --> 00:19:05.881\nI'm probably not gonna do all of that.\n\n350\n00:19:05.881 --> 00:19:09.570\nI'm just gonna use the Find and\nReplace, and go on my merry way.\n\n351\n00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:13.213\nAnd you can even say well,\nit would replace all of these.\n\n352\n00:19:13.213 --> 00:19:17.833\nWell yeah, but you could go ahead and\nselect these cells first and\n\n353\n00:19:17.833 --> 00:19:22.370\nthen just say okay, go ahead and\nfind all instances of CCI.\n\n354\n00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.835\nLet's go ahead and,\ndo I want to match case or not match case?\n\n355\n00:19:24.835 --> 00:19:28.360\nDon't have to worry about that whole\nsubstitute doing some weird things.\n\n356\n00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:31.303\nAnd then, within the sheet, yeah,\nall right, let's go ahead and\n\n357\n00:19:31.303 --> 00:19:34.299\nmaybe not even- I just want to look\nat the values, not the formulas,\n\n358\n00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:35.922\ncuz right now there are no formulas.\n\n359\n00:19:35.922 --> 00:19:38.700\nBut I wouldn't want to\nuse it in the formulas.\n\n360\n00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:42.314\nAnd then, when I go ahead and replace\nthis with DDC, and then, I go ahead and\n\n361\n00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:45.419\nsay Replace All, and it only replaced\nthe ones that I selected and\n\n362\n00:19:45.419 --> 00:19:47.475\nnot the ones that I didn't have selected.\n\n363\n00:19:47.475 --> 00:19:50.630\nSo you could make that argument.\n\n364\n00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:53.322\nBut then what if I wanted to just\nchange that second delimiter?\n\n365\n00:19:53.322 --> 00:19:59.760\nJust finding that one in the middle\nhyphen or dash and change it to a slash?\n\n366\n00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:03.919\nThere's a case where you would\nprobably want to go ahead and\n\n367\n00:20:03.919 --> 00:20:08.912\nuse that particular function,\nthe substitute with, I could tell what\n\n368\n00:20:08.912 --> 00:20:13.759\ninstance number without Justin trying\nto go over there and break it.\n\n369\n00:20:13.759 --> 00:20:16.220\n[LAUGH] And that kind of thing,\n\n370\n00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:21.350\nthat's when you might wanna\nresort to using the substitute.\n\n371\n00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:25.043\nYou would substitute the Find and\nReplace for the substitute function, woo!\n\n372\n00:20:25.043 --> 00:20:26.028\nOkay.\n\n373\n00:20:26.028 --> 00:20:28.562\nBy themselves.\n\n374\n00:20:28.562 --> 00:20:31.914\nAll right, I definitely see\nreasons why I wanna use it, and\n\n375\n00:20:31.914 --> 00:20:33.800\nwhere they'll work perfectly.\n\n376\n00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:38.346\nVery little amounts of text,\nyou will see this a lot of time in Word.\n\n377\n00:20:38.346 --> 00:20:42.269\nAdvanced examples of how\nyou can extract text,\n\n378\n00:20:42.269 --> 00:20:45.997\ncuz a lot of people use\nthese text functions,\n\n379\n00:20:45.997 --> 00:20:52.620\nIn their everyday use of Excel because\nthey wanna get that stuff out of it.\n\n380\n00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:54.876\nIt's not numerical data, it's text data.\n\n381\n00:20:54.876 --> 00:21:00.690\nSo you will see these more than\nyou probably think you will.\n\n382\n00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:05.365\nSo, I believe I am done.\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne, I don't know,\n\n383\n00:21:05.365 --> 00:21:06.600\nI don't know how I feel.\n\n384\n00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:10.331\nI can see drilling down into finer\ndetails, but by and large, I'm probably\n\n385\n00:21:10.331 --> 00:21:14.063\njust gonna select and find and replace\nuntil I wanna set up maybe a pipeline or\n\n386\n00:21:14.063 --> 00:21:16.705\nhave multiple sheets kind\nof cascade off each other.\n\n387\n00:21:16.705 --> 00:21:20.696\nWhere I want to do a lot of automated\nprocesses or something like that.\n\n388\n00:21:20.696 --> 00:21:22.730\nPretty interesting things.\n\n389\n00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:24.252\nNow before we get out of here Yvonne,\n\n390\n00:21:24.252 --> 00:21:27.138\nany final words of wisdom for us?\n&gt;&gt; I just wanted to come back to the whole\n\n391\n00:21:27.138 --> 00:21:28.960\nlike you going, but I want to do this!\n\n392\n00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:29.992\nI want to do this!\n\n393\n00:21:29.992 --> 00:21:33.800\nI'm glad that you're saying that,\ncuz I was like okay, stop, Justin.\n\n394\n00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:36.908\nStop asking questions but\nyou're probably asking the same questions.\n\n395\n00:21:36.908 --> 00:21:38.580\nWell, what if I want to do that?\n\n396\n00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:39.472\nWhat if I want to do that?\n\n397\n00:21:39.472 --> 00:21:42.924\nAnd this is the thing with Excel is like,\nokay, well I got that to work,\n\n398\n00:21:42.924 --> 00:21:45.593\nbut now in this situation,\nit totally doesn't work.\n\n399\n00:21:45.593 --> 00:21:47.202\nSo how do I change it?\n\n400\n00:21:47.202 --> 00:21:51.268\nHow do I, and that's just\nunderstanding these functions and\n\n401\n00:21:51.268 --> 00:21:57.200\nhow you sometimes gotta make some really\nlong looking functions where just like.\n\n402\n00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:01.540\nOo, that looks so scary but it's just\ncombining all of these different pieces.\n\n403\n00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:03.900\nSo I just want to let you\nknow I appreciate your,\n\n404\n00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.909\nwell I want it to do this because\nyou all out there are probably\n\n405\n00:22:06.909 --> 00:22:09.908\nsaying the same thing.\n&gt;&gt; Well I'm glad you appreciate it, Vonne,\n\n406\n00:22:09.908 --> 00:22:10.781\nbecause I'm not gonna stop.\n\n407\n00:22:10.781 --> 00:22:13.943\nAnd you better not stop coming on back\nto see more about Office Pro, but for\n\n408\n00:22:13.943 --> 00:22:15.910\nnow we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n409\n00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:17.026\nSo siging off for Office Pro.TV,\n\n410\n00:22:17.026 --> 00:22:18.478\nI've been your host Justin Anderson.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n411\n00:22:18.478 --> 00:22:19.894\nI'm Vonne Smith.\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n412\n00:22:19.894 -->

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.690\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison, and we're\ncoming back with more Excel functions.\n\n4\n00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.258\nAnd well, if you've been trying to\nfind top notch Office training,\n\n5\n00:00:23.258 --> 00:00:25.006\nwell your search is over.\n\n6\n00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:26.920\nThat's right, you're where you need to be.\n\n7\n00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.370\nAnd well, we're going to be talking\nabout Find and Search in this episode.\n\n8\n00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.200\nAnd luckily, we have someone who's gonna\ntell us all about it, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.313\nHow are you doing today, Vonne?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic after\n\n10\n00:00:34.313 --> 00:00:35.942\nthat magnificient introduction.\n\n11\n00:00:35.942 --> 00:00:37.734\nI really like what you did there.\n\n12\n00:00:37.734 --> 00:00:39.930\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I try, I try.\n\n13\n00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.750\nI was like, it's good,\nis it gonna come out?\n\n14\n00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.082\nI think it went well but we are gonna\nbe talking about Find and Search.\n\n15\n00:00:45.082 --> 00:00:48.227\nAnd it seems fairly self-explanatory, but\n\n16\n00:00:48.227 --> 00:00:53.440\nsometimes things that seem simple\nactually have a few more gotchas that may\n\n17\n00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.337\ncrop up than one would anticipate, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n18\n00:00:57.337 --> 00:01:00.289\nso the Find finds and the Search searches.\n\n19\n00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:01.653\nAll right bye, we're done yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n20\n00:01:01.653 --> 00:01:07.601\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know, it is that simple.\n\n21\n00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:12.920\nIn its entirety or by itself,\nit is exactly what it says it's gonna do.\n\n22\n00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:19.815\nYou're going to find a specific character,\nor string of characters, within a cell.\n\n23\n00:01:19.815 --> 00:01:24.166\nSo this is a text function and\nyeah, that's what it's gonna do.\n\n24\n00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:24.790\nSo, you know what?\n\n25\n00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.980\nI think we should just start off by just\njumping right in and figuring it out.\n\n26\n00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.780\nSo let's all go.\n\n27\n00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.760\nSo guess what?\n\n28\n00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.052\nFuego is a funny cat.\n\n29\n00:01:34.052 --> 00:01:36.360\nHe is, he is crazy.\n\n30\n00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.201\nSo Justin, if I asked you,\n\n31\n00:01:40.201 --> 00:01:44.543\ntell me what letter position is\n\n32\n00:01:44.543 --> 00:01:49.543\nthe letter F?\n&gt;&gt; That one's first position, and\n\n33\n00:01:49.543 --> 00:01:53.002\nthen one, two, three, four-\n&gt;&gt; No, no just the one-\n\n34\n00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:54.193\n&gt;&gt; Just the first, first.\n\n35\n00:01:54.193 --> 00:01:56.190\n&gt;&gt; Okay, [LAUGH] correct.\n\n36\n00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.950\nNumber one is the first position.\n\n37\n00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.720\nSo, that's exactly what the Find and\nthe Search function does.\n\n38\n00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.101\nIt's going to look at a string\nof text in this cell.\n\n39\n00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:11.110\nAnd by the way, this is in cell\none because I just made it big.\n\n40\n00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.950\nAnd it's just is going across those.\n\n41\n00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.530\nSo it does not live in A, B or C.\n\n42\n00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.740\nSo it's looking at this cell and\n\n43\n00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.920\nI ask you to find the letter F and\nit said position one.\n\n44\n00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.970\nExactly, so if I ask you to\ntell me what is the position\n\n45\n00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.459\nof the letter O.\n&gt;&gt; I think that would be position\n\n46\n00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:31.369\nfive, right?\n\n47\n00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:36.488\nF is one, U is two, E is three,\nG is four, and O is five.\n\n48\n00:02:36.488 --> 00:02:39.028\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yes, and in Excel,\n\n49\n00:02:39.028 --> 00:02:44.930\nwe all start counting from one,\nas opposed to other coding languages.\n\n50\n00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.030\nI know I've learned from you, Justin,\nthat is a zero length string.\n\n51\n00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.906\nMeaning that it starts at zero, the first\ncharacter is a zero and then one, two.\n\n52\n00:02:54.906 --> 00:03:00.060\nSo if you know that from other programming\nlanguages, that doesn't apply here.\n\n53\n00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.040\nOne is one, that's it.\n&gt;&gt; Okay so, these are one index.\n\n54\n00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.901\nThese count just like we normally would,\nright?\n\n55\n00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:13.922\nI have one cup, one computer, and this\nletter is in one, two, three, four, five.\n\n56\n00:03:13.922 --> 00:03:16.489\nSo all right, I gotta try to\nremember that, cuz I'm sure I'll\n\n57\n00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.296\nforget that at some point.\n&gt;&gt; I know, it might be a little difficult\n\n58\n00:03:19.296 --> 00:03:21.850\nfor you because it's so\ningrained in you that it is zero.\n\n59\n00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:22.820\nSo just know that.\n\n60\n00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.032\nAnd we've actually thrown out another\nword that you and I have been using.\n\n61\n00:03:27.032 --> 00:03:32.238\nIndex, its index position,\nstarting number.\n\n62\n00:03:32.238 --> 00:03:36.599\nI mean there's different ways that Excel,\nand how we maybe talk, will say it.\n\n63\n00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.813\nBut when we're talking about\nthe index of an array,\n\n64\n00:03:39.813 --> 00:03:45.498\nI don't wanna get too crazy on this, but\nit's basically saying the position, okay?\n\n65\n00:03:45.498 --> 00:03:50.242\nSo in case we're using that terminology,\nthe character position or\n\n66\n00:03:50.242 --> 00:03:52.793\nthe index number of that character.\n\n67\n00:03:52.793 --> 00:03:54.686\nIt's the same thing.\n\n68\n00:03:54.686 --> 00:03:56.240\nAll right, so that sounds good.\n\n69\n00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.030\nLet's go ahead and check this out.\n\n70\n00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.970\nBy the way, the space,\nit's not a blank cell.\n\n71\n00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.800\nThere is a physical space in there.\n\n72\n00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.180\nSo what position would the space be?\n\n73\n00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.270\nWell, why don't we just\nlet the function tell us?\n\n74\n00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.510\nSo let's click our cell that we\nwant the function to go into.\n\n75\n00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.180\nThis one's pretty simple, so\nlet's start by trying to type it out.\n\n76\n00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.640\nWe're going to say =find and\nopen the parenthesis, find text.\n\n77\n00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.220\nAnd notice that when I click on this,\nthis is going to say,\n\n78\n00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.250\nwhat am I wanting to find?\n\n79\n00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.120\nNow I can type in the letter F,\nbut it's right here.\n\n80\n00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.608\nSo we want to say, find the letter F, or\n\n81\n00:04:36.608 --> 00:04:41.647\nin this sense, A4 comma within what text?\n\n82\n00:04:41.647 --> 00:04:42.740\nThis cell.\n\n83\n00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.780\nNow the other one that's right here\nthat's in, that's not bold and\n\n84\n00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:52.160\nit's in like the brackets,\nthat means it's an optional parameter.\n\n85\n00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.600\nWe don't need that so we are just\ngoing to close the parenthesis.\n\n86\n00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.780\nAnd there, just like Justin said,\nhe was correct.\n\n87\n00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:04.660\nThe letter F is in cell one, or\nin position one, sorry about that.\n\n88\n00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.530\nSo if I pull this down, okay, we're going\nto go ahead and so, okay, what's wrong?\n\n89\n00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:10.890\nWhat did I do?\n\n90\n00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.243\nI did something wrong here.\n\n91\n00:05:13.243 --> 00:05:15.210\nI actually didn't mean\nto do that on purpose.\n\n92\n00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.140\nIt's that when I'm looking at this\nfunction, it's saying find it in Fuego,\n\n93\n00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.486\nI want it to stay that way.\n\n94\n00:05:20.486 --> 00:05:22.229\nSo what do I need to do?\n\n95\n00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:24.781\nI want this to relatively change so\n\n96\n00:05:24.781 --> 00:05:28.660\nI need to absolute reference\nthat cell right there.\n\n97\n00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.218\nSo let's go ahead and\nsay always look back at,\n\n98\n00:05:32.218 --> 00:05:36.063\nI put it in the wrong place,\nsorry, right there.\n\n99\n00:05:36.063 --> 00:05:37.774\nSo, that's not right either.\n\n100\n00:05:37.774 --> 00:05:39.905\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We got it now, but\n\n101\n00:05:39.905 --> 00:05:43.521\nthese are things that can\ndefinitely happen, right?\n\n102\n00:05:43.521 --> 00:05:46.011\nYou gotta go back and you gotta\nchange this to an absolute reference.\n\n103\n00:05:46.011 --> 00:05:49.666\nAnd then woopsy-daisy, I got the dollar\nsign in the wrong place and then,\n\n104\n00:05:49.666 --> 00:05:53.020\njust keep it in mind cuz you're\ngonna get some weird errors.\n\n105\n00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.644\nIt's okay.\n\n106\n00:05:53.644 --> 00:05:54.363\nWe all do it.\n\n107\n00:05:54.363 --> 00:05:56.500\nIt happens.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I do it all the time.\n\n108\n00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.960\nEspecially when I'm recording an episode.\n\n109\n00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.320\nSo [LAUGH] you can see\nthat if I pull this down,\n\n110\n00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.890\nthat's exactly what's\ngoing to happen here.\n\n111\n00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:07.070\nThere is a space but it's looking for\nthe space in the sixth position.\n\n112\n00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.510\nThe U is in the second.\n\n113\n00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.800\nNow, this is something\nthat I wanna point out,\n\n114\n00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.370\nthat it's saying that this\nis in the 12th position.\n\n115\n00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.300\nHm, you've already spotted it,\nhaven't you there, Justin?\n\n116\n00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.070\nIt's like cuz I said I don't\ngive me the other one.\n\n117\n00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.670\nBut why is this one saying\n1 is this one saying 12,\n\n118\n00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.346\nyou wanna take a gander at this?\n&gt;&gt; This is another one of those times\n\n119\n00:06:26.346 --> 00:06:28.528\nwhere case actually matters, and\n\n120\n00:06:28.528 --> 00:06:33.800\nthis could be a trip up because then\nother times case doesn't matter in Excel.\n\n121\n00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.130\nBut if you're doing a find and\nI'm gonna go out on a limb and\n\n122\n00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.750\nI'm gonna guess that\nSearch does this as well.\n\n123\n00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:40.430\nI could be wrong.\n\n124\n00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.790\nWe'll see,\nget to laugh at me if I am wrong.\n\n125\n00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.100\nCase does matter because I'm searching for\nsomething very particular, so\n\n126\n00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.870\ndo keep that in mind.\n&gt;&gt; You're almost correct.\n\n127\n00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.470\nI think you have it backwards\nthe way you're explaining it.\n\n128\n00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.450\nIs that Find is case-sensitive,\n\n129\n00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.419\nSearch is not.\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n130\n00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.768\nthe Search part was a guess.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n131\n00:07:01.768 --> 00:07:03.750\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the Search part was a guess.\n\n132\n00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.000\nJust because we've done a couple\nof episodes where I'm like, yeah,\n\n133\n00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.740\nthat doesn't make sense but you're\ntelling me that Search actually is case\n\n134\n00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.710\ninsensitive.\n&gt;&gt; And Find is case sensitive, correct.\n\n135\n00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:18.130\nAnd that's gonna be one of the main\ndifferences between why would I\n\n136\n00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:19.780\nuse Find and why would I use Search.\n\n137\n00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.260\nSo let's go through just so\nI can show you the search.\n\n138\n00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:27.030\nAnd for fun, let's go to the dialog\nbox just to go ahead and\n\n139\n00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:31.070\nshow you that it will say, find what text?\n\n140\n00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:35.460\nI want to find this\nletter within this cell.\n\n141\n00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.470\nAnd don't worry about the start number for\nright now.\n\n142\n00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:39.367\nAnd right now, it's 1.\n\n143\n00:07:39.367 --> 00:07:42.958\nAnd if we pulled this down,\neverything would be.\n\n144\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.192\nI did it again.\n\n145\n00:07:44.192 --> 00:07:49.750\n[LAUGH] Let's go ahead and\nabsolute reference this, there we go.\n\n146\n00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:53.090\nSorry guys, and\nabsolute reference, there we go.\n\n147\n00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.571\nEverything is the same except for\nthis one, and\n\n148\n00:07:56.571 --> 00:08:00.758\nthat's where you're going\nto see Sensitivity to case.\n\n149\n00:08:00.758 --> 00:08:05.646\nIf I change this o to an uppercase O,\nnow I'm going to actually\n\n150\n00:08:05.646 --> 00:08:10.070\ngenerate an error or\nbasically, I don't understand.\n\n151\n00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:11.050\nI don't find anything.\n\n152\n00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:17.190\nI can not find the letter o\ncapitalized within this cell.\n\n153\n00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:20.090\nSame thing if I did here for U but\n\n154\n00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:25.670\nnotice that of course the search is\njust gonna go ahead and keep finding it.\n\n155\n00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:29.010\nSo you can of course see\nwhere you might need to,\n\n156\n00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:33.530\nI need to have it be case sensitive or\nno, either or.\n\n157\n00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:36.409\nSo that's the biggest difference\nbetween these two functions, so\n\n158\n00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:37.425\njust keep that in mind.\n\n159\n00:08:37.425 --> 00:08:44.070\nNotice that there are two Fs in here and\nthere's actually two Us in here.\n\n160\n00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:48.850\nSo with this one,\nlet's put that back down to a lowercase.\n\n161\n00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:51.567\nIf I wanted to say, well,\nI want the second one.\n\n162\n00:08:51.567 --> 00:08:55.862\nI'll have another example in a little bit,\nbut for right now,\n\n163\n00:08:55.862 --> 00:08:59.850\nyou could come back into\nthis particular function.\n\n164\n00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:04.592\nAnd there is a start num, specifies the\ncharacter at which to start the search.\n\n165\n00:09:04.592 --> 00:09:08.057\nSo if I didn't want it to\nstart at character one,\n\n166\n00:09:08.057 --> 00:09:11.278\nmaybe I wanted it to\nstart at character five.\n\n167\n00:09:11.278 --> 00:09:14.378\nCuz I know that the first\nU is past character five.\n\n168\n00:09:14.378 --> 00:09:20.047\nIf I click on there, notice how then it's\ngoing to generate the result of number 13.\n\n169\n00:09:20.047 --> 00:09:24.975\nIf you count over, that u right here\nin funny is going to be in character\n\n170\n00:09:24.975 --> 00:09:27.741\nspot position, or index number 13.\n\n171\n00:09:27.741 --> 00:09:29.357\nSo that's what it's going to generate.\n\n172\n00:09:29.357 --> 00:09:34.550\nNow this might be maybe you're looking for\nspecific characters in maybe\n\n173\n00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:39.569\nlike a part number but you don't want\nit to look at the first six because\n\n174\n00:09:39.569 --> 00:09:44.530\nthat's specified for let's say\nlike a factory number or whatever.\n\n175\n00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:48.340\nDon't look at that, but\nlook at this, and it's consistent.\n\n176\n00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:53.218\nThat might be where, yes, the start number\nwould be very advantageous to you because\n\n177\n00:09:53.218 --> 00:09:54.789\nof where you want to start.\n\n178\n00:09:54.789 --> 00:09:59.734\nBut I'm sure some of you all out\nthere are going, well yeah but,\n\n179\n00:09:59.734 --> 00:10:04.967\nwhat if it's like, I just wanna\nfind the second U, or the second A?\n\n180\n00:10:04.967 --> 00:10:06.942\nIs there a way that I could do that?\n\n181\n00:10:06.942 --> 00:10:08.800\nThere is, okay.\n\n182\n00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.169\nSo just keep that in mind,\nI'm coming to it in just a little bit.\n\n183\n00:10:12.169 --> 00:10:15.800\nAll right, so,\njust a couple other example.\n\n184\n00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.885\nWe've already done it in the basic.\n\n185\n00:10:17.885 --> 00:10:21.484\nI just wanted to through this in here for\njust showing you when find and\n\n186\n00:10:21.484 --> 00:10:25.786\nsearch is going to be different and when\nthe start number would make a difference.\n\n187\n00:10:25.786 --> 00:10:30.584\nBecause of, well there's varying\nlengths of text here, so\n\n188\n00:10:30.584 --> 00:10:36.150\nthat way your start position might\nbe a little off from here and there.\n\n189\n00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:40.772\nSo, let's move on to that whole\nexample I just gave to you.\n\n190\n00:10:40.772 --> 00:10:43.830\nAll right, well I want to go ahead and\n\n191\n00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:49.110\nfind the part number in here,\nbut I want to find a dash.\n\n192\n00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.840\nAnd it's always going to\ngive you the first one.\n\n193\n00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.240\nWe'll use the search for this one.\n\n194\n00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.605\nAt this point we could use Find or\n\n195\n00:10:54.605 --> 00:10:57.192\nSearch because a dash isn't\ncase-sensitive right there.\n\n196\n00:10:57.192 --> 00:10:59.850\nYou don't have an upper or lower case.\n\n197\n00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:00.960\nSo let's go ahead and start.\n\n198\n00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:05.180\nWe will say, let's go ahead and\nsearch for, what am I looking for?\n\n199\n00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:10.580\nSince I'm typing this out, I'm going\nto need to make sure I put the text\n\n200\n00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:15.354\nin parenthesis and say,\nI want you to find this string of text.\n\n201\n00:11:15.354 --> 00:11:18.611\nBy the way, in this other sheet back\nover here, I'm not gonna click on it,\n\n202\n00:11:18.611 --> 00:11:19.970\nI actually typed the word cat.\n\n203\n00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:24.350\nSo like open the quote,\nC-A-T, close the quote.\n\n204\n00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.730\nThat is the string of text\nthat I would like you to find.\n\n205\n00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:30.427\nSo it doesn't have to be a cell reference,\nit could be any amount of text.\n\n206\n00:11:30.427 --> 00:11:31.772\nSo find this within,\n\n207\n00:11:31.772 --> 00:11:37.450\nmake sure I put the comma because that\nneeds to be the next argument, this cell.\n\n208\n00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:39.280\nNot worrying about the start number.\n\n209\n00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.940\nClose the parenthesis.\nAnd it gives me number four.\n\n210\n00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:46.860\nAnd if I look, one, two, three, yep, four.\n\n211\n00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.910\nThe dash is in the fourth position.\n\n212\n00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.635\nAnd if I take this and pull down.\n\n213\n00:11:51.635 --> 00:11:53.828\nDon't have to worry about\nrelative reference on this one.\n\n214\n00:11:53.828 --> 00:11:56.580\n[LAUGH] So it's saying,\nyep, it's in the fourth.\n\n215\n00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:57.310\nThat's the third.\n\n216\n00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:00.180\nThat's the eighth because I\nhave varying degrees of text.\n\n217\n00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:03.434\nBefore that first dash, so\nI'm going to get different results.\n\n218\n00:12:03.434 --> 00:12:07.001\nSo this where using that start number or\nthe start index,\n\n219\n00:12:07.001 --> 00:12:10.880\nthat's gonna give us all sorts\nof weird results, isn't it?\n\n220\n00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:16.126\nSo we need to figure out is there\nanother way that I could do this?\n\n221\n00:12:16.126 --> 00:12:18.090\nThere is, okay?\n\n222\n00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:22.593\nSo it involves a little bit more typing.\n\n223\n00:12:22.593 --> 00:12:28.145\nSo I'm gonna double check,\nI have it all written out in my notes.\n\n224\n00:12:28.145 --> 00:12:30.890\nI also have it down here just\nin case it gets a little weird.\n\n225\n00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:32.307\nSo we're gonna try and type it out.\n\n226\n00:12:32.307 --> 00:12:35.783\nBut if you think about what we're\nsaying here, is we're doing a search.\n\n227\n00:12:35.783 --> 00:12:40.836\nAnd then the start index right here,\nthe start number,\n\n228\n00:12:40.836 --> 00:12:45.028\nwhat I'd like to do is I'd like to put,\nwell,\n\n229\n00:12:45.028 --> 00:12:49.990\nI want you to start after\nthe first time you look for it.\n\n230\n00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:52.956\nSo what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna put a search within a search.\n\n231\n00:12:52.956 --> 00:12:58.377\nOkay, so we're going to try it,\nhere we go, we are going to copy it.\n\n232\n00:12:58.377 --> 00:13:01.469\nI actually clicked the Ctrl key for\nthe first time, that's so good.\n\n233\n00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.105\nOf course I can't get it right.\n\n234\n00:13:04.105 --> 00:13:08.376\n[LAUGH] Y'all are just watching me\ndo all sorts of fun mess ups today.\n\n235\n00:13:08.376 --> 00:13:10.087\nSo let's double-click.\n\n236\n00:13:10.087 --> 00:13:11.087\nThere we go.\n\n237\n00:13:11.087 --> 00:13:14.786\nI was trying to get it started for\nus so then I could say\n\n238\n00:13:14.786 --> 00:13:20.370\nthat this our first argument,\nif you wanna say, or the first search.\n\n239\n00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:26.820\nThe parameter of our start needs\nto start after that second comma.\n\n240\n00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:31.930\nSo I said find this within this text,\nwhere am I going to start?\n\n241\n00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:35.794\nSo then we're going to say I want\nyou to then search again and\n\n242\n00:13:35.794 --> 00:13:39.209\nwith this search I want you\nto open the parenthesis.\n\n243\n00:13:39.209 --> 00:13:42.735\nI want to open the quote\ndash close the quote, and\n\n244\n00:13:42.735 --> 00:13:48.169\nthen we're going to say within cell A2,\nso we're still looking at that.\n\n245\n00:13:48.169 --> 00:13:54.017\nAnd then what you're gonna do here\nis you're gonna close this and\n\n246\n00:13:54.017 --> 00:13:56.910\nyou're gonna say +1.\n\n247\n00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:59.192\nThink about it.\n\n248\n00:13:59.192 --> 00:14:03.855\nSearch this within this but,\nthen search again, look for\n\n249\n00:14:03.855 --> 00:14:09.190\nthat, and in all of that,\nyou're just gonna do the next one.\n\n250\n00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:14.422\nAdd it together and that gives me one,\ntwo, three, four, five, six, seven.\n\n251\n00:14:14.422 --> 00:14:19.960\nAll right, so that's the index so\nwe're just saying, search this and\n\n252\n00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:25.430\nthen add one, the next iteration\nof where this is going to go.\n\n253\n00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:26.630\nAnd that's what we're going to get.\n\n254\n00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:28.840\nNow, why does this give me a value?\n\n255\n00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.092\nCuz there isn't a second hyphen,\nor dash right there.\n\n256\n00:14:31.092 --> 00:14:34.719\nSo that's a little loopy right there, but\n\n257\n00:14:34.719 --> 00:14:38.562\ndoes that syntax satisfy\nyour coding brain?\n\n258\n00:14:38.562 --> 00:14:40.585\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It does for now.\n\n259\n00:14:40.585 --> 00:14:44.674\nI think I'm gestating a question\nthat I'll have in just a moment, but\n\n260\n00:14:44.674 --> 00:14:49.202\nthere's another column there, is third\njust rinse and repeat are the same?\n\n261\n00:14:49.202 --> 00:14:50.554\nIs it just more nest?\n\n262\n00:14:50.554 --> 00:14:54.071\nAnd these are working inside out,\nso it's gonna do the inner search,\n\n263\n00:14:54.071 --> 00:14:57.170\nreplace that number,\nput that inside of the outer search.\n\n264\n00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:59.705\nAnd then if we had a third one,\nwe would do that one and\n\n265\n00:14:59.705 --> 00:15:02.774\nthen place that in the outer most search,\nso it's inside out.\n\n266\n00:15:02.774 --> 00:15:06.271\nI don't know of anything otherwise,\nI am at a loss for\n\n267\n00:15:06.271 --> 00:15:09.467\nother things that work inside out.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n268\n00:15:09.467 --> 00:15:12.038\nthis is one of those where at first,\nI'll be honest,\n\n269\n00:15:12.038 --> 00:15:16.240\nI thought why don't you just take this and\njust say well just do it twice?\n\n270\n00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.620\nRight, you know Justin,\nthat's not gonna work, is it?\n\n271\n00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:21.666\nNo, cuz exactly what you just said.\n\n272\n00:15:21.666 --> 00:15:23.329\nIt's gotta say you have to do this.\n\n273\n00:15:23.329 --> 00:15:25.638\nThen do this, then do.\n\n274\n00:15:25.638 --> 00:15:31.910\nYou have to go ahead and go inside,\nout to be able to make this work.\n\n275\n00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:33.146\nSo you can't just add a two.\n\n276\n00:15:33.146 --> 00:15:36.061\nIt's not just like, the second and\nthe third and the fourth.\n\n277\n00:15:36.061 --> 00:15:39.252\nYou got to put it all together again.\n\n278\n00:15:39.252 --> 00:15:42.100\nAll right, so I am consulting\nmy notes because, like I said,\n\n279\n00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.680\nthis gets a little weird.\n\n280\n00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:47.440\nSo we've got the first search, okay, open.\n\n281\n00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:50.127\nNow we've got the second search.\n\n282\n00:15:50.127 --> 00:15:55.237\nAnd so in this one,\nwe're going to say the start number and\n\n283\n00:15:55.237 --> 00:16:01.287\nyou're gonna do it again, say search And\nthen you're going to say,\n\n284\n00:16:01.287 --> 00:16:05.978\nokay, [LAUGH] we're gonna open this up,\ndo the dash,\n\n285\n00:16:05.978 --> 00:16:10.596\nclose that, comma,\nwe're gonna look in cell A2.\n\n286\n00:16:10.596 --> 00:16:15.969\nAnd then you're going\nto say that's search,\n\n287\n00:16:15.969 --> 00:16:19.500\n[LAUGH] search, perfect.\n\n288\n00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:26.112\nNow we've gotta do another plus one and\nthen another plus one,\n\n289\n00:16:26.112 --> 00:16:29.652\nthink about it, nope.\n&gt;&gt; You have an extra comma in there.\n\n290\n00:16:29.652 --> 00:16:30.238\n&gt;&gt; Do I?\n\n291\n00:16:30.238 --> 00:16:30.873\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, after the,\n\n292\n00:16:30.873 --> 00:16:34.218\nbehind the [CROSSTALK].\n&gt;&gt; Right there, that's it,\n\n293\n00:16:34.218 --> 00:16:36.014\nthat's what we need.\n\n294\n00:16:36.014 --> 00:16:41.109\n[SOUND] I know, it's a lot, right,\n[LAUGH] you gotta be very careful on it,\n\n295\n00:16:41.109 --> 00:16:44.165\nbut like I said, it's this inside of this.\n\n296\n00:16:44.165 --> 00:16:48.426\nSo then you add plus one, do it again,\nand then add another plus.\n\n297\n00:16:48.426 --> 00:16:52.789\nAnd then it's going to give you\nthe third instance of that dash.\n\n298\n00:16:52.789 --> 00:16:59.753\nAnd this one is not giving me one because\nit doesn't have a third dash, but here.\n\n299\n00:16:59.753 --> 00:17:01.625\nOne, two, three, one, two, three,\n\n300\n00:17:01.625 --> 00:17:04.650\nthat's what you can do.\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne,\n\n301\n00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:10.050\nhere's my question, and hopefully, I'm\njust kind of interested if this works out.\n\n302\n00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:15.980\nSo for the second column, could we\ndo a reference to the first column?\n\n303\n00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:20.050\nSo instead of a search inside of a search,\nthat inner search, can we just point that\n\n304\n00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:25.430\nto the first column, like the number four?\n&gt;&gt; So you're saying replace all of this,\n\n305\n00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:29.102\nright, from here with, which would be B2,\n\n306\n00:17:29.102 --> 00:17:31.896\nis that what you're asking?\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n307\n00:17:31.896 --> 00:17:33.201\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, wait,\n\n308\n00:17:33.201 --> 00:17:35.459\nwe need a, how about that?\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n309\n00:17:35.459 --> 00:17:36.287\nthat was all right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n310\n00:17:36.287 --> 00:17:37.239\n&gt;&gt; No comma.\n\n311\n00:17:37.239 --> 00:17:38.827\n&gt;&gt; No comma, cuz B, okay,\n\n312\n00:17:38.827 --> 00:17:41.333\ncuz that already is inside of it, see?\n\n313\n00:17:41.333 --> 00:17:45.384\nBut all of the text that was in there,\n\n314\n00:17:45.384 --> 00:17:49.683\nit lives in B2, so yes.\n&gt;&gt; Now what if we take that and we drag it\n\n315\n00:17:49.683 --> 00:17:51.969\nto the right to the third column?\n&gt;&gt; This one?\n\n316\n00:17:51.969 --> 00:17:53.140\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n317\n00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:56.469\n&gt;&gt; Well we're gonna need to-\n\n318\n00:17:56.469 --> 00:17:57.569\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we're close.\n\n319\n00:17:57.569 --> 00:17:59.472\n&gt;&gt; We need to change our references,\n\n320\n00:17:59.472 --> 00:18:00.789\nwe're looking at A2.\n\n321\n00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:08.488\nRight, okay, and then what lives in C2 is\nwhat lives in B2, so yeah, there you go.\n\n322\n00:18:08.488 --> 00:18:11.397\nThere's nothing wrong\nwith doing it that way.\n\n323\n00:18:11.397 --> 00:18:15.144\nAnd the way you just said it, it makes\na little bit more logical sense to us,\n\n324\n00:18:15.144 --> 00:18:18.515\ndoesn't it?\n&gt;&gt; So full disclosure, the only reason I\n\n325\n00:18:18.515 --> 00:18:23.080\nknow how to do this is, I used Excel for\nsome of my undergrad work.\n\n326\n00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:26.527\nAnd we would do things like, I need\nto know the 100th, like we would have\n\n327\n00:18:26.527 --> 00:18:29.890\nfunctions that would depend on,\nI need to know the 100th iteration.\n\n328\n00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:35.670\nAnd so we would make 100 columns and\nthen make them reference the previous one.\n\n329\n00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:37.800\nAnd then just pull them\nto the right 100 times,\n\n330\n00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.754\nthen hide all the things in between.\n&gt;&gt; Wow, yeah, well,\n\n331\n00:18:40.754 --> 00:18:44.589\nfor something like that you have\nto nest so many times, cuz yeah,\n\n332\n00:18:44.589 --> 00:18:48.032\nthat one that we were doing\nbefore this down here, right?\n\n333\n00:18:48.032 --> 00:18:52.368\nThat started to get, I even got lost,\nthat's why I have to consult my map over\n\n334\n00:18:52.368 --> 00:18:54.837\nhere to make sure that\nI'm typing it right,\n\n335\n00:18:54.837 --> 00:18:58.341\nbecause I gotta make sure that\nI close the right parentheses.\n\n336\n00:18:58.341 --> 00:19:02.426\nThis is a huge helpful hint,\n\n337\n00:19:02.426 --> 00:19:07.200\nis doing intermediate steps.\n\n338\n00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.608\nDoing a column that goes ahead and\ndoes the calculation or the function.\n\n339\n00:19:10.608 --> 00:19:13.590\nThat you're then gonna nest\nwithin the other function, and\n\n340\n00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:15.294\njust use that as a cell reference.\n\n341\n00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:19.620\nYou have to go with whatever\nmakes it easier on your brain.\n\n342\n00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:22.658\nAnd if this makes it easier, let me do\nthe first one, let me do the second,\n\n343\n00:19:22.658 --> 00:19:23.493\nlet me do the third.\n\n344\n00:19:23.493 --> 00:19:28.155\nLet me go then now put them all together,\nthat's a little easier sometimes.\n\n345\n00:19:28.155 --> 00:19:29.858\n&gt;&gt; And just full disclosure,\n\n346\n00:19:29.858 --> 00:19:32.449\nyou have to be careful,\ncuz you can get all\n\n347\n00:19:32.449 --> 00:19:36.832\nkinds of twisted with what needs to\nbecome an absolute reference now.\n\n348\n00:19:36.832 --> 00:19:39.367\nInstead of, yeah, we'll just copy and\npaste this over here and\n\n349\n00:19:39.367 --> 00:19:40.980\neverything's good.\n\n350\n00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:44.870\nBecause if you're doing a previous\nreference and you're dragging things over,\n\n351\n00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:49.190\nthen that part number actually moves\nover to column 1 and the third column.\n\n352\n00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:52.050\nAnd then things get messed up,\nso you have to be careful there\n\n353\n00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:54.000\nwhen you're employing this method.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n354\n00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.190\nexactly what we just did, like,\nwait, now we need to keep going.\n\n355\n00:19:57.190 --> 00:20:01.660\nSo we probably would stay here,\nor maybe this one,\n\n356\n00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:04.670\nand absolute reference this, and\nthen pull it across and what have you.\n\n357\n00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:06.573\nSo that's a really good point, and\n\n358\n00:20:06.573 --> 00:20:10.643\nyou've seen me mess this up almost in\nevery example that we've done so far.\n\n359\n00:20:10.643 --> 00:20:13.801\nIs when to absolute reference,\nand when to relative reference.\n\n360\n00:20:13.801 --> 00:20:16.223\nIt will you get you every time,\nand I've been doing this for,\n\n361\n00:20:16.223 --> 00:20:18.890\nI don't even wanna tell you how\nmany years I've been doing this.\n\n362\n00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:23.230\nSo it happens, it's okay, cool, great.\n\n363\n00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:27.606\nSo now let's do one last one, this'll\nkinda get the whole point, because again,\n\n364\n00:20:27.606 --> 00:20:31.875\nI could have stopped after five minutes,\nand find finds, and search searches.\n\n365\n00:20:31.875 --> 00:20:36.176\nBut I wanna make sure you have some\ncontext as to when to use this, because,\n\n366\n00:20:36.176 --> 00:20:38.720\nwell we just did a double or\na triple search.\n\n367\n00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.512\nSearch, within a search, within a search.\n\n368\n00:20:40.512 --> 00:20:44.440\nYou're gonna see this\na lot in combinations,\n\n369\n00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:48.620\nof course, like other functions, in\nconjunction with other functions, right.\n\n370\n00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:53.620\nOkay, so I need to look for\nthings, let's review the,\n\n371\n00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:57.520\nsorry, giving some of it away,\nremember the left function, okay?\n\n372\n00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.910\nIf you haven't watched that episode,\ndefinitely go back and\n\n373\n00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:02.910\nwatch it cuz these kinda build upon\neach other, at least these ones.\n\n374\n00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:07.320\nSo with the left,\nwhat the left function does, and\n\n375\n00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.820\nlet's just dump in it so we can see.\n\n376\n00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:12.220\nIt says look at a specific string of text,\nlook at A2,\n\n377\n00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:17.620\nand then retrieve the number\nof characters from the left.\n\n378\n00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:21.750\nSo we said three,\ngive me three characters in here.\n\n379\n00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:26.870\nWell that's fine if you only have Bob,\n\n380\n00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:30.900\nbut when we pull this down,\nit's like Bob, Rob, Rob, wait.\n\n381\n00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:33.550\nNo that's not working, because it's\nRobert and it's Robert Stephen.\n\n382\n00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:37.240\nIt's not gonna work when you\nhave variable amounts of text.\n\n383\n00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:43.130\nYour desired results are gonna be\nsomething that look like this over here.\n\n384\n00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:49.730\nI'd like you to pull out\nthe first name within this text.\n\n385\n00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:53.720\nWell, okay, that looks cool, and\nyou can actually see, it's been done, and\n\n386\n00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.470\nI didn't type that out,\nthat is a function.\n\n387\n00:21:56.470 --> 00:22:00.710\nSo what's the commonality of,\nwhat is the separator,\n\n388\n00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:04.980\nwhat indicates when the first name ends?\n\n389\n00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:08.990\nNot the dash, the hyphen, it is the space.\n\n390\n00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:13.032\nif I could say hey,\ncan you just go ahead and\n\n391\n00:22:13.032 --> 00:22:19.897\nretrieve me all of the characters from\nthe left up until the first space.\n\n392\n00:22:19.897 --> 00:22:23.410\nIf you can give me the first space,\nwouldn't that give me the first name?\n\n393\n00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:27.780\nWell yes, it would, so hear me say it,\n\n394\n00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:31.560\ncan you go and find that first space?\n\n395\n00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:35.050\nGive me the space and\nthen give me everything to the left.\n\n396\n00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:40.600\nOkay, well, why don't we go ahead and\ndo it, all right?\n\n397\n00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:44.780\nSo just to kinda, I did the first one,\nbut let's go ahead and\n\n398\n00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:47.990\nget rid of all of this for fun, okay?\n\n399\n00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:52.073\nSo the position of the first space,\nlet's just do the find.\n\n400\n00:22:52.073 --> 00:23:01.130\nAnd find the space within this text,\nenclose it.\n\n401\n00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:05.850\nSo that's at position four, so that\nwould say give me the left characters 4,\n\n402\n00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:09.780\nthis would be 7, this would be 14,\nthis would be 3.\n\n403\n00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:14.199\nOkay, see, I already started\ndoing the whole intermediary.\n\n404\n00:23:14.199 --> 00:23:18.481\nI was gonna do it on this example, but\nyou jumped ahead, that's okay [LAUGH].\n\n405\n00:23:18.481 --> 00:23:19.339\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry Vonne,\n\n406\n00:23:19.339 --> 00:23:22.513\nsometimes my brain's just like,\nwhat about this, what about this?\n\n407\n00:23:22.513 --> 00:23:27.171\nAnd I get ahead of myself, I'm sorry.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Just don't ever do again.\n\n408\n00:23:27.171 --> 00:23:30.100\n[LAUGH] No, it was a perfect time for\nit to come out.\n\n409\n00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:34.290\nSo cuz we've actually talked about\nthis off camera before, yeah,\n\n410\n00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:37.570\nyou always wanna do intermediate\ncolumns in between.\n\n411\n00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:40.995\nSo I'm like, I'm gonna start\nputting those in the episodes.\n\n412\n00:23:40.995 --> 00:23:46.275\nSo let's say I want to find, so\nwe're going to say, give me the left.\n\n413\n00:23:46.275 --> 00:23:50.756\nOkay, so now it's going to say,\nwhat is the text, what am I looking at?\n\n414\n00:23:50.756 --> 00:23:53.948\nI want you to look at\nthis particular cell.\n\n415\n00:23:53.948 --> 00:23:57.539\nWell, the number of cells and this is\nwhere, couldn't we just go ahead and\n\n416\n00:23:57.539 --> 00:23:58.058\nuse that?\n\n417\n00:23:58.058 --> 00:24:00.075\nI know, but let's just have fun and\ntype it out.\n\n418\n00:24:00.075 --> 00:24:06.699\nWe wanna say well find the,\ncuz you saw me do it before,\n\n419\n00:24:06.699 --> 00:24:13.767\nspace within this particular cell,\nand then that's it.\n\n420\n00:24:13.767 --> 00:24:20.531\nWe go ahead and close that one,\nclose that one, and it gives me Bob.\n\n421\n00:24:20.531 --> 00:24:25.382\nSo now with Bob, it'll go to Robert,\nRobert Steven, and Bo.\n\n422\n00:24:25.382 --> 00:24:28.839\nSo it's going to the space and\nthen giving me there.\n\n423\n00:24:28.839 --> 00:24:30.692\nAnd yeah, you guessed it.\n\n424\n00:24:30.692 --> 00:24:35.014\nCould I just go ahead and\nsay, give me the left of this\n\n425\n00:24:35.014 --> 00:24:39.352\nfrom that number of spaces,\nnumber of characters?\n\n426\n00:24:39.352 --> 00:24:41.139\nOops, wrong one.\n\n427\n00:24:41.139 --> 00:24:43.699\nYeah, you can totally do that.\n\n428\n00:24:43.699 --> 00:24:48.559\nIt just depends on what way you want\nto actually look at your function.\n\n429\n00:24:48.559 --> 00:24:50.209\nDo you want it to look like that?\n\n430\n00:24:50.209 --> 00:24:51.887\nOr do you want it to look like that?\n\n431\n00:24:51.887 --> 00:24:56.438\nNothing wrong with it, but that's how\nyou can retrieve first names out of\n\n432\n00:24:56.438 --> 00:25:00.198\ncolumns which is, a lot of times,\na lot of people want to do.\n\n433\n00:25:00.198 --> 00:25:03.898\nWhether it's names,\npart numbers, direct, whatever,\n\n434\n00:25:03.898 --> 00:25:07.080\njust find up to the space,\nokay, very common one.\n\n435\n00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:12.367\nA few last little things just to let you\nknow, gonna pull up the Help files here.\n\n436\n00:25:12.367 --> 00:25:17.826\nThere is a FIND and FINDB for whether\nyou're going to indicate characters or\n\n437\n00:25:17.826 --> 00:25:21.335\nbytes, or\nyour double-byte character fonts.\n\n438\n00:25:21.335 --> 00:25:24.150\nSo mostly for your Japanese, Chinese and\n\n439\n00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:28.736\nKorean languages that would have to\nbe installed on your machine for\n\n440\n00:25:28.736 --> 00:25:32.530\nit to understand that, and for\nit to be able to use that.\n\n441\n00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:34.245\nBut one thing to notice out of here is,\n\n442\n00:25:34.245 --> 00:25:37.276\nit says these functions may not\nbe available in all languages.\n\n443\n00:25:37.276 --> 00:25:43.513\nOkay, so that's something to look out for\nif like it just can't understand it,\n\n444\n00:25:43.513 --> 00:25:48.943\nand that's something to be careful of and\nthe FIND is case sensitive.\n\n445\n00:25:48.943 --> 00:25:52.542\nThe SEARCH does have a SEARCHB as well for\nthe bytes and\n\n446\n00:25:52.542 --> 00:25:57.502\nthat it also can support they have\nthe same warnings here is that you have to\n\n447\n00:25:57.502 --> 00:26:02.954\nhave your double byte fonts and your not\nor maybe not supported in all languages.\n\n448\n00:26:02.954 --> 00:26:08.901\nBut the other thing is that you use\nwildcard characters within your search.\n\n449\n00:26:08.901 --> 00:26:12.017\nI didn't wanna go that\nfar down the rabbit hole,\n\n450\n00:26:12.017 --> 00:26:15.588\nwith this particular example\ntrying to keep it basic but\n\n451\n00:26:15.588 --> 00:26:20.842\nyou can use things that can find, you can\nuse the question mark and the asterisks.\n\n452\n00:26:20.842 --> 00:26:23.946\nBut if you actually wanted it\nto find the question mark or\n\n453\n00:26:23.946 --> 00:26:27.383\nthe asterisks,\nyou'd have to put a in front of it, so\n\n454\n00:26:27.383 --> 00:26:31.616\nthat's something that you might wanna\nexperiment of why you might wanna use\n\n455\n00:26:31.616 --> 00:26:36.144\nthe search that has a little bit more\ncapabilities of using wildcard character.\n\n456\n00:26:36.144 --> 00:26:39.950\nSo just wanna make it one of\nthose last little comments or\n\n457\n00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:45.228\njust information about these two\nfunctions, but does exactly what it says.\n\n458\n00:26:45.228 --> 00:26:47.856\nWe're going to find and\nwe're going to search, and\n\n459\n00:26:47.856 --> 00:26:50.648\nthen usually do something else with it.\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne,\n\n460\n00:26:50.648 --> 00:26:54.295\nyou brought up a great point, always\nconsult the documentation because now\n\n461\n00:26:54.295 --> 00:26:57.089\nmy mind is racing,\nwhat languages is it not available in?\n\n462\n00:26:57.089 --> 00:27:01.314\nBut we know it works in English, and\nwell unfortunately that is Vonne and\n\n463\n00:27:01.314 --> 00:27:04.223\nI is native language, so\nthat's it works for us,\n\n464\n00:27:04.223 --> 00:27:08.266\nit works on my machine that is\nofficially certified in this episode.\n\n465\n00:27:08.266 --> 00:27:11.160\nBut thank you so much and\nthere's some tricky stuff there but\n\n466\n00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:15.307\ndefinitely doable and very applicable this\nis appealing to my programmatic mind, and\n\n467\n00:27:15.307 --> 00:27:18.261\nwell hopefully you have found\nsomething appealing as well and\n\n468\n00:27:18.261 --> 00:27:21.701\nwe'll come on back but for now we're\ngonna go ahead and get out of here.\n\n469\n00:27:21.701 --> 00:27:24.498\nSo signing off for Office ProTv,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n470\n00:27:24.498 --> 00:27:25.242\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n471\n00:27:25.242 --> 00:27:26.890\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n472\n00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:32.648\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

OfficePro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.152 --> 00:00:18.841\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and we're\nback at you with more Excel functions and\n\n4\n00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:21.470\nwe're gonna be talking\nabout LEN in this episode.\n\n5\n00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.600\nNo I'm not talking about that aunt\nyou haven't spoken to in two years,\n\n6\n00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.610\nwe're actually talking about\nLEN which is an excel function.\n\n7\n00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.587\nHopefully we're gonna have everything\nexplained to us in great detail by the one\n\n8\n00:00:31.587 --> 00:00:34.344\nand only Vonne Smith,\nhow are you doing today, Vonne?\n\n9\n00:00:34.344 --> 00:00:37.619\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing pretty good [LAUGH]\n[INAUDIBLE] like Aunt LEN?\n\n10\n00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:40.383\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, southern.\n\n11\n00:00:40.383 --> 00:00:43.464\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well I have an Aunt Cookie,\n\n12\n00:00:43.464 --> 00:00:45.950\nan Aunt Tootie, and an Aunt Candy.\n\n13\n00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.290\n&gt;&gt; I actually have an Aunt LEN, so-\n&gt;&gt; Do you really?\n\n14\n00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.249\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n15\n00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:49.799\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That was like-\n\n16\n00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:50.800\n&gt;&gt; Not L-E-N, but\n\n17\n00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.341\nit's just the way I say it.\n\n18\n00:00:52.341 --> 00:00:55.268\n&gt;&gt; I was just like,\nwhere is that coming from?\n\n19\n00:00:55.268 --> 00:00:55.768\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n20\n00:00:55.768 --> 00:00:58.455\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so sorry, we derail sometimes,\n\n21\n00:00:58.455 --> 00:01:02.008\nbut that was fun.\nYes, the LEN, and\n\n22\n00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:05.887\nwhat does it do?\nWell, it gives you the length,\n\n23\n00:01:05.887 --> 00:01:11.029\nthat's it, done.\n[LAUGH] That's all it does,\n\n24\n00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:12.239\nokay?\nNow the thing is,\n\n25\n00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:17.200\nby itself, the only thing it's gonna\ngive you is the number of characters and\n\n26\n00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.130\nthe length of that text string in a cell.\n\n27\n00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.238\nYou could use it by itself\nto maybe do some checking,\n\n28\n00:01:24.238 --> 00:01:28.940\nI've seen it done like in a lot of\ntutorials, just like show you characters.\n\n29\n00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.306\nThis is just how many is in there,\nand just like see if we did this,\n\n30\n00:01:32.306 --> 00:01:34.770\nthen it changes the length\nof what's in there.\n\n31\n00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.861\nSo that's really what it is,\nyou're gonna use it in combinations with\n\n32\n00:01:38.861 --> 00:01:43.361\nother functions, like things like\nthe search function, the find function,\n\n33\n00:01:43.361 --> 00:01:45.839\nthe substitute, the mid, right, left.\n\n34\n00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:49.866\nAnd there's so many different places\nwhere you're going to find like I need to\n\n35\n00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:54.077\ndetermine the length of this text string,\nand then do some kind of calculations on\n\n36\n00:01:54.077 --> 00:01:57.390\nit, like take off this many characters,\nand so on and so forth.\n\n37\n00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.470\nSo that's where you're really going to see\nthe power in this particular function.\n\n38\n00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.490\nWe're gonna keep it really simple for this\nexample, just introduce you to it, show\n\n39\n00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.360\nyou a couple, I would say, basic examples\nof it and that's it, so why don't we go?\n\n40\n00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.340\nJump on down, and I'm going to\ntest you Justin, are you ready?\n\n41\n00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.550\nOkay, tell me how many characters\nare in the word hello.\n\n42\n00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.850\n&gt;&gt; Five, I think there's five\ncharacters there, I count real good.\n\n43\n00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.150\n&gt;&gt; I was like, that was really fast,\nyou kinda scared me a little bit,\n\n44\n00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.230\nand yes, you are correct,\nlet's see if you're correct.\n\n45\n00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.160\nSo what is the function?\n\n46\n00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.187\nWe're going to type in LEN just one thing,\n\n47\n00:02:38.187 --> 00:02:43.582\nwhat is the thing you're looking at,\nand then you close it and it says, 5.\n\n48\n00:02:43.582 --> 00:02:47.913\nSo good job,\nyou know how to count 5 characters,\n\n49\n00:02:47.913 --> 00:02:53.598\nwhich you say that would be the same\nanswer for the next two cells?\n\n50\n00:02:53.598 --> 00:02:57.469\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Vonne, I'm gonna go out\non a limb here and I'm gonna say yes,\n\n51\n00:02:57.469 --> 00:02:58.810\nexcept there's a trick.\n\n52\n00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.700\nThere's hidden spaces in there somewhere,\nisn't there?\n\n53\n00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.610\nHow did you know?\n\n54\n00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.675\nBecause of how I said it?\n\n55\n00:03:06.675 --> 00:03:09.740\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well there is some of that inflection\n\n56\n00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.370\nthat makes me question what you're doing.\n\n57\n00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.010\nBut, this is actually something that will\nbe the bane of your existence widowing\n\n58\n00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.580\ntext processing,\nas those hidden space characters.\n\n59\n00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.340\nSo, I went really fast but\nI was on the fence,\n\n60\n00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.113\nyou might have tricked\nme with the first one.\n\n61\n00:03:25.113 --> 00:03:29.383\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH] no, you know me well\nenough, when I start going like this and\n\n62\n00:03:29.383 --> 00:03:33.890\nyeah that's exactly what we've\ngot right here, even like Pi.\n\n63\n00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.450\nThere's 6 characters in there?\n\n64\n00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.780\nThe length of that cell is 6?\n\n65\n00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.840\nYeah because there's one, two, three,\n\n66\n00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.800\nfour extra spaces that I purposefully\nput in there for this particular lesson.\n\n67\n00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.030\nThere's a front space, and where it says\nI am a bunny, those types of things.\n\n68\n00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.660\nSo, that's all the length does,\n\n69\n00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.940\nit's going to return the length\nof the string of text.\n\n70\n00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.950\nOkay, cool, I mean,\nwe could do it down here, but\n\n71\n00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.316\nthere's the same examples what's up there.\n\n72\n00:04:04.316 --> 00:04:09.297\nBy itself, that's it,\nnothing else really going on there.\n\n73\n00:04:09.297 --> 00:04:12.698\nYou have an inquisitive look over\nthere at, you're scaring me Justin.\n\n74\n00:04:12.698 --> 00:04:14.823\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n75\n00:04:14.823 --> 00:04:16.408\n&gt;&gt; No, I feel like LEN might be used a\n\n76\n00:04:16.408 --> 00:04:20.500\ngreat deal in conjunction with a couple of\nother functions that we've talked about.\n\n77\n00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.690\nTrim, and clean, if we use those we'll\nbe getting more consistent results.\n\n78\n00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.047\nMaybe if we nest them or\nintentionally say go ahead and\n\n79\n00:04:30.047 --> 00:04:32.517\nclean this up now find the length of it.\n\n80\n00:04:32.517 --> 00:04:34.580\n&gt;&gt; You can, yes,\nyou could totally do that.\n\n81\n00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.450\nSo yes, get rid of all the extra\nspaces and then give me the length or\n\n82\n00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.250\nif there is a specific length that we need\nto stay in and then trim everything else.\n\n83\n00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.880\nI mean there's so\n\n84\n00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.200\nmany different combinations of\nwhere you could go with this.\n\n85\n00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.510\nIt can really get crazy cuz like I said,\nby itself, its not gonna do much for you.\n\n86\n00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.269\nSo let's do a few examples that I've said,\n\n87\n00:04:54.269 --> 00:04:57.562\njust trying to keep it basic\nbecause it starts to go.\n\n88\n00:04:57.562 --> 00:04:59.708\nYou automatically start using this and\n\n89\n00:04:59.708 --> 00:05:03.420\nthen doing it inside of a other\nfunctions inside of other function.\n\n90\n00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.560\nYou see length like six times in a long\n\n91\n00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.374\nstring that just like gives you\nthe answer of like, mm-hm, what?\n\n92\n00:05:10.374 --> 00:05:12.742\nSo let's just try to\nkeep it pretty simple.\n\n93\n00:05:12.742 --> 00:05:16.254\nI'm using the same example that\nI used in my left, mid and\n\n94\n00:05:16.254 --> 00:05:21.540\nright episode so definitely check that\nout because we are gonna build on this.\n\n95\n00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.380\nSo when we have something like say,\nthe different cat toys that we have,\n\n96\n00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.590\nwe have our different hockey teams, that\nwe have the Knights and the Predators.\n\n97\n00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:31.830\nBecause we're selling things for\n\n98\n00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.070\nthe Stanley Cup, even though the Tampa\nBay Lightning are gonna to win, yay!\n\n99\n00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.140\nSo we've got here, so if I'm going\nto have something that's uniform,\n\n100\n00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.740\nthen the left function is\ngoing to work really well.\n\n101\n00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.132\nSaying hey, give me the first three\ncharacters, from the left, and\n\n102\n00:05:46.132 --> 00:05:47.962\nthe same thing with the mid.\n\n103\n00:05:47.962 --> 00:05:54.250\nAll right, we'll go ahead and go to index\nor position number five, and give me two.\n\n104\n00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.421\nTotally fine for these cuz everything is\nthe same and consistent but the color,\n\n105\n00:05:59.421 --> 00:06:03.837\nnow that's where, if I was going\nto do the regular right function.\n\n106\n00:06:03.837 --> 00:06:09.460\nSo go to the right and give me\nthe four characters from the right.\n\n107\n00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.600\nWell that's great for the word blue but\n\n108\n00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.560\nwhat about chartruce,\nwhat about fuchsia, right?\n\n109\n00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.394\nThat's not gonna work very well,\nthis has varying degrees of text.\n\n110\n00:06:20.394 --> 00:06:26.710\nMm-hm, I'm gonna do a Justin, mm-hm,\n\n111\n00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:32.060\nwhat could we do here, mm-hm,\nI know what we could do, what is the same?\n\n112\n00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:37.130\nIn this example,\nthe same is the first characters,\n\n113\n00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.450\nthere are seven characters in here.\n\n114\n00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:46.440\nOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven,\nwith all the dashes in there, okay.\n\n115\n00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:51.661\nWell, if I know that's the same,\nthen couldn't I just say like,\n\n116\n00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:56.805\nwhat if I took the length of the string,\nminus seven characters.\n\n117\n00:06:56.805 --> 00:07:01.579\nCuz then the remainder will go ahead and\ngive me the amount of character that I\n\n118\n00:07:01.579 --> 00:07:06.720\nwould need to put into the right\nfunction to say extract that amount.\n\n119\n00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.800\nWell that would be kind of fun, right?\n\n120\n00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.291\nAnd just to kinda get the idea,\nlets do that, right?\n\n121\n00:07:14.291 --> 00:07:18.934\nSo if this one is,\nlets do length by itself, okay, so\n\n122\n00:07:18.934 --> 00:07:24.213\nwhat is the length of this cell,\nthat's 11 and then down.\n\n123\n00:07:24.213 --> 00:07:31.499\nOkay that's where we have 12 and\n14 and 17, well what is 11 minus 7?\n\n124\n00:07:31.499 --> 00:07:35.860\nThat's 4 [LAUGH] I've got\nmy math guy over here,\n\n125\n00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:40.310\nso 11 minus, wait, no,\n7 minus 12, 12 minus 7.\n\n126\n00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:43.040\nOoh, am I the one who should\nbe doing math over here?\n\n127\n00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.710\nYou get the idea, so then that's\ngoing to give me that number of\n\n128\n00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.170\ncharacters through\nretrieve from the right.\n\n129\n00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:52.590\nOkay, well then, let's write it,\nlet's go ahead and say not length,\n\n130\n00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:57.451\ngive me the right function and the right\nfunction is, what am I going to look at?\n\n131\n00:07:57.451 --> 00:08:01.733\nI wanna look at this particular cell Well,\nthen what's the number of characters?\n\n132\n00:08:01.733 --> 00:08:07.295\nWell, we just said that it would\ngive me the length of that cell,\n\n133\n00:08:07.295 --> 00:08:10.570\nand then just take away seven.\n\n134\n00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:16.770\nSo we would say len, and\nthen open parentheses, of this cell.\n\n135\n00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:20.830\nThen we go ahead and close this,\ncuz remember that was all that was in it.\n\n136\n00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:23.770\nJust go minus 7,\n\n137\n00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:29.360\nclose the outside of the right, so\nthe outsides of the right function.\n\n138\n00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:34.290\nThose inside parentheses\nare the arguments of the len function.\n\n139\n00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:36.040\nAnd then we get blue.\n\n140\n00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:39.940\nAnd if we pull it on down,\nnow I get all the variants.\n\n141\n00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:44.080\nNow, that's pretty simple in\nthe sense of logically thinking.\n\n142\n00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.640\nThese are going to stay consistent, so\n\n143\n00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.490\njust take off the first seven\ncharacters of the length.\n\n144\n00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:50.843\nCool, there you go.\n\n145\n00:08:50.843 --> 00:08:55.378\nPretty, to me, a simple or\na basic example of how to use\n\n146\n00:08:55.378 --> 00:09:00.620\nthe length in conjunction with\nanother function right there.\n\n147\n00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:05.970\nSo any gotchas,\nis your brain twisting too much here?\n\n148\n00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:07.160\n&gt;&gt; I don't think there's any gotchas.\n\n149\n00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:07.920\nOther than the fact,\n\n150\n00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.510\nsometimes you gotta take a step back and\nreevaluate the problem, right?\n\n151\n00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.520\nAnd you're like, wait a minute,\nI get some inconsistencies here.\n\n152\n00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.010\nThis is where you start going,\nwell, what do I know is true?\n\n153\n00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:18.470\nWhat are the things that are the same?\n\n154\n00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:20.070\nWhat are the things that are different?\n\n155\n00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:24.587\nBecause the only way you\narrive at this is by going!\n\n156\n00:09:24.587 --> 00:09:29.436\nWell, there's always consistently\nthese seven characters at the front,\n\n157\n00:09:29.436 --> 00:09:31.590\nhow do I use that to my advantage?\n\n158\n00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:36.250\nInstead of going, well,\nI'll only get these seven characters.\n\n159\n00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:37.810\nEssentially, you're doing an adjustment.\n\n160\n00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:40.160\nYou go over here, and\nnow I'm gonna grab these.\n\n161\n00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:45.750\n&gt;&gt; This is reminding me of your\nalgorithmic problem solving series of\n\n162\n00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:46.730\ndraw a picture.\n\n163\n00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:51.030\nWhat do I know, what do I need to know,\nand sometimes change the problem.\n\n164\n00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:54.619\nAnd that's where, wait, like you said,\nthis is what's consistent.\n\n165\n00:09:54.619 --> 00:09:56.770\nNow, is all your data\ngonna always be that way?\n\n166\n00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:58.010\nNot necessarily.\n\n167\n00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:00.484\nSometimes it will, when you're talking\nabout part numbers and things like that.\n\n168\n00:10:00.484 --> 00:10:03.358\nSo it's like, let me flip it around.\n\n169\n00:10:03.358 --> 00:10:09.420\nYeah, how to kind of logically come at\nthis stuff is sometimes the hardest part.\n\n170\n00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.990\nAnd I've seen examples of this.\n\n171\n00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:13.822\nAnd just through all my experience,\n\n172\n00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:15.920\nit's like, that's one way to go ahead and\nlook at it.\n\n173\n00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:20.110\nI'm like, cool, that's the way\nwe're going to do it, so great.\n\n174\n00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:25.044\nOn that same thought,\nwhat if I have something like this?\n\n175\n00:10:25.044 --> 00:10:29.290\nOkay, well, I wanna extract the last name.\n\n176\n00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:32.212\nIf you've watched the find\nthe search episode,\n\n177\n00:10:32.212 --> 00:10:36.004\nwe talked about using the left\nwith that particular function.\n\n178\n00:10:36.004 --> 00:10:42.743\nOn this one, we're gonna use the len\nwith the right function again.\n\n179\n00:10:42.743 --> 00:10:46.099\nBut we're also gonna combine the find.\n\n180\n00:10:46.099 --> 00:10:48.330\nWoo, all right, you ready?\n\n181\n00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:48.882\nHere we go.\n\n182\n00:10:48.882 --> 00:10:52.910\nSo if you think about this,\nI want to extract the last thing.\n\n183\n00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:55.520\nWell, what's the consistent thing?\n\n184\n00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.250\nWhat's something that I can\nkinda pinpoint that this\n\n185\n00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:00.280\nshould be the same on all of them?\n\n186\n00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:06.186\nWell, the last name is the last\nword before that space.\n\n187\n00:11:06.186 --> 00:11:07.847\nNow, these are just first and\nlast names, so\n\n188\n00:11:07.847 --> 00:11:10.630\nwe're not worrying about double names and\neverything like that.\n\n189\n00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:11.795\nAgain, it might throw some things.\n\n190\n00:11:11.795 --> 00:11:14.710\nBut again,\nthe last name is the last space, so\n\n191\n00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:19.220\nFuego, Bishop, Bo, Pumpkin, Pooma.\n\n192\n00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:23.380\nI could just say, well,\nwhy don't we look at the right, and\n\n193\n00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:26.780\nthen retrieve me that many characters.\n\n194\n00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.670\nHow am I gonna get that many characters?\n\n195\n00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:31.460\nWell, I want you to find the space.\n\n196\n00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:35.201\nAnd once you find where the space is,\ncuz what does the find function do?\n\n197\n00:11:35.201 --> 00:11:36.424\nIt tells me the position.\n\n198\n00:11:36.424 --> 00:11:37.700\nSo here's the position of it.\n\n199\n00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.790\nWell, if I could take that and\n\n200\n00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:44.370\nthen minus it from the length,\nthen that would essentially give\n\n201\n00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:47.320\nme the number of characters that I\nneed the write function to retrieve.\n\n202\n00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:51.081\nWoo, I know,\nyou're going some circles, right?\n\n203\n00:11:51.081 --> 00:11:51.632\nWhat is it?\n\n204\n00:11:51.632 --> 00:11:52.448\nWhoa, wee!\n\n205\n00:11:52.448 --> 00:11:54.633\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n206\n00:11:54.633 --> 00:11:56.256\nwe may just put that in another episode.\n\n207\n00:11:56.256 --> 00:12:00.110\n&gt;&gt; I know!\n&gt;&gt; But just for old time's sake, woo!\n\n208\n00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:01.510\nYou have to be careful.\n\n209\n00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:04.880\nBecause sometimes you can get into a\ncyclic nature where you go, wait a minute,\n\n210\n00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:05.595\nwhat am I doing?\n\n211\n00:12:05.595 --> 00:12:08.160\nBut with Excel, you try some things.\n\n212\n00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.110\nAnd you're either gonna get a no,\nor there's a value error.\n\n213\n00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:13.200\nOr you go, aw.\n\n214\n00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.420\nBut what you have done,\nis you've figured out what doesn't work.\n\n215\n00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:21.220\nSo don't necessarily get kinda bogged down\nwith, it didn't work like I wanted it to.\n\n216\n00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:24.560\nWell, now you know, but\nwere you closer than you were originally?\n\n217\n00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:28.125\nAnd some of you may be going, but\nwhy would I ever need last names?\n\n218\n00:12:28.125 --> 00:12:31.620\nWell, if you need to arrange labels,\nmaybe you're doing a mail merge.\n\n219\n00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:34.480\nMaybe you're doing, I don't know,\nsome reporting or something.\n\n220\n00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.825\nAnd all you have from input data\nis you asked for your full name.\n\n221\n00:12:37.825 --> 00:12:41.370\nAnd you go, well I have a bunch of people,\nthere are some hiccups here.\n\n222\n00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:44.320\nThey just type first, space, last name.\n\n223\n00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.664\nBut I actually wanna put them backwards.\n\n224\n00:12:46.664 --> 00:12:51.050\n[SOUND] You need to slice and dice,\nso this is a legitimate use case.\n\n225\n00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:55.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this is honestly some of the\ntop things that people want out of Excel.\n\n226\n00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.885\nSo yes, I'm sure you're like,\nI always want this.\n\n227\n00:12:57.885 --> 00:12:59.470\nYes, great, awesome.\n\n228\n00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:00.787\nAnd yeah, wasn't there the date?\n\n229\n00:13:00.787 --> 00:13:02.197\nThere was something with the date,\n\n230\n00:13:02.197 --> 00:13:04.649\nthat we just had to flip them\nbecause the dates were negative.\n\n231\n00:13:04.649 --> 00:13:06.700\nAnd you were like, yeah,\ncuz dates are in the past.\n\n232\n00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:08.530\nAnd I was like, yeah, exactly.\n\n233\n00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:12.110\nYou don't think that straight,\nso anyways, keep on going.\n\n234\n00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:15.590\nWhy don't we just break it up.\n\n235\n00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:18.911\nLet's give me the length\nof Fuego Firepants.\n\n236\n00:13:18.911 --> 00:13:20.850\nAll right, that's 15 characters.\n\n237\n00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:25.840\nGo ahead and pull it down through Pooma,\njust get some math in our head.\n\n238\n00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.740\nAnd don't worry, we've got a good\nguy over here to keep us in check.\n\n239\n00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.420\nSo we've got, you're okay.\n\n240\n00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.330\n[LAUGH] Like, wait,\nwhat am I supposed to do?\n\n241\n00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:33.260\nNo, you're fine.\n\n242\n00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:37.180\nSo we're going to find,\nwhat are we going to find?\n\n243\n00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:39.240\nThe text that we want is a space.\n\n244\n00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:43.190\nSo open quotes, space,\nquote, quote, comma.\n\n245\n00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:46.980\nWithin this string, that's all I need.\n\n246\n00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.550\nOkay, so that's where, 6.\n\n247\n00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:50.730\nSo I would just pull this down.\n\n248\n00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:55.755\nSo you would think that the number of\ncharacters from the right would be, well,\n\n249\n00:13:55.755 --> 00:14:00.570\n15 minus 6 is, Wait, [LAUGH].\n\n250\n00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:01.717\n&gt;&gt; It's 9.\n&gt;&gt; 9?\n\n251\n00:14:01.717 --> 00:14:02.309\n&gt;&gt; It's 9.\n\n252\n00:14:02.309 --> 00:14:04.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I am so bad at math in my head.\n\n253\n00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:06.822\nI'm just going,\ndon't bring your fingers out.\n\n254\n00:14:06.822 --> 00:14:11.208\n[LAUGH] Okay,\nthis one is that is that, okay.\n\n255\n00:14:11.208 --> 00:14:13.974\nOkay, great that's the number of\ncharacters we're gonna take out\n\n256\n00:14:13.974 --> 00:14:14.660\nfrom the right.\n\n257\n00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:17.740\nSo why don't we write it all out?\n\n258\n00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:21.140\nWe're going to say,\ngive me the right function.\n\n259\n00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:22.780\nAnd what are we looking for?\n\n260\n00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:26.770\nThis string,\nwhat's the number of characters?\n\n261\n00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:31.150\nWell, the number of characters\nis really the length.\n\n262\n00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:33.848\nSo we need to go ahead and\nsay, what is the length of a2?\n\n263\n00:14:33.848 --> 00:14:36.180\nAnd by the way, I do have this\nwritten out here in my notes.\n\n264\n00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:40.246\nSo I'm cheating slightly,\nbecause the syntax can get a little scary.\n\n265\n00:14:40.246 --> 00:14:43.886\nSo I've got len of (a2),\n\n266\n00:14:43.886 --> 00:14:49.818\nminus the Find of the same\nthing we just wrote.\n\n267\n00:14:49.818 --> 00:14:53.710\nWhoops, that one needs to be\na double quote, goodness gracious.\n\n268\n00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:54.560\nAnd then we go there.\n\n269\n00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.510\nAnd then what are we finding in cell a2?\n\n270\n00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:59.967\nWe're gonna close that, of the Find.\n\n271\n00:14:59.967 --> 00:15:02.660\nAnd now I need to close all of the right.\n\n272\n00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:03.970\nAnd now,\nthis is like you were just saying.\n\n273\n00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:06.270\nOkay, did I do that right?\n\n274\n00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:08.370\nDid I get the right comma?\n\n275\n00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:10.420\nIt will tell you when\nyou have a syntax error.\n\n276\n00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.609\nI'm pretty sure I don't,\nbut let's, fingers crossed.\n\n277\n00:15:12.609 --> 00:15:15.139\nYay, it worked [LAUGH]!\n\n278\n00:15:15.139 --> 00:15:22.420\nBut it's exactly what we just said,\nblank, minus where the space position is.\n\n279\n00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:25.650\nAnd then that's the number of\ncharacters that you are retrieving\n\n280\n00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:27.610\nfrom the right of this cell.\n\n281\n00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:29.450\nCool, and then we pull it on down.\n\n282\n00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:34.170\nAnd then we get out all those different\nvarying degrees of last name.\n\n283\n00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:39.288\nSo this is one of those, well,\nwe did this in another episode.\n\n284\n00:15:39.288 --> 00:15:41.625\nAnd I really wanna go ahead and\nbring this back.\n\n285\n00:15:41.625 --> 00:15:47.046\nCuz sometimes when we're going this whole\nlogical thinking of where I need to get,\n\n286\n00:15:47.046 --> 00:15:50.476\nsometimes it might be\neasier to break it down.\n\n287\n00:15:50.476 --> 00:15:52.359\nBreak it down and, I can find the space.\n\n288\n00:15:52.359 --> 00:15:53.439\nThen I can find the length.\n\n289\n00:15:53.439 --> 00:15:55.030\nThen I could do this,\nthen I could do that.\n\n290\n00:15:55.030 --> 00:16:00.209\nWell then, if I take 15 minus 6 of this,\nthat would work.\n\n291\n00:16:00.209 --> 00:16:01.432\nCool.\n\n292\n00:16:01.432 --> 00:16:06.285\nSometimes writing it all out in one\nlong nested function is more difficult\n\n293\n00:16:06.285 --> 00:16:09.030\nthan it needs to be, for your brain.\n\n294\n00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:09.710\nOkay?\n\n295\n00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:13.130\nSo, I could go ahead and\ndo the same thing using cell references.\n\n296\n00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:18.050\nAnd then maybe with this I might want to\nuse the insert function dialog box to,\n\n297\n00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:19.279\nkind of, help me along.\n\n298\n00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:24.460\nThis one, it's not necessarily going to,\nbut because I know how this works,\n\n299\n00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.630\nbut you might need to use\nthat to help you along.\n\n300\n00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:32.750\nSo I could say,\ndo the wright function on this cell- well,\n\n301\n00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:34.080\nwhat's the number of characters?\n\n302\n00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.440\nIt's this minus that.\n\n303\n00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:39.280\nOops.\nClose it down.\n\n304\n00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:44.940\nIt's gonna give me the exact same results.\n\n305\n00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:46.450\nAnd this might make\na little bit more sense.\n\n306\n00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:49.420\nBut if I was looking at this by itself,\nlike what's in D2?\n\n307\n00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:51.160\nWhat's in C2?\n\n308\n00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.950\nThis whole thing written out, well,\n\n309\n00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:58.420\nit's the length minus finding\nthe space character position, and\n\n310\n00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:01.070\nthen taking that and then finding that's\nthe number of character from the right.\n\n311\n00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:05.096\nSo sometimes it could be great, sometimes\nit might not be if you're going back to\n\n312\n00:17:05.096 --> 00:17:07.407\nunderstand because then\nyou have to go back and\n\n313\n00:17:07.407 --> 00:17:11.318\nclick through all of the different cells\nto understand what's in that cell and\n\n314\n00:17:11.318 --> 00:17:13.953\nthe function there and\nhow it's all tied together.\n\n315\n00:17:13.953 --> 00:17:17.450\nSo 6000, half, one or\nthe other, did I say it right?\n\n316\n00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:20.195\n&gt;&gt; Nope [LAUGH].\n\n317\n00:17:20.195 --> 00:17:24.210\n[LAUGH] 6 dozen, 72 and half of 1.\n\n318\n00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.684\nYou said six dozen or half one of another.\n\n319\n00:17:26.684 --> 00:17:29.247\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n320\n00:17:29.247 --> 00:17:30.742\n&gt;&gt; I never get it right.\n\n321\n00:17:30.742 --> 00:17:33.748\n&gt;&gt; But it does make for good fun.\n\n322\n00:17:33.748 --> 00:17:35.880\nActually I do have a question about this.\n\n323\n00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:39.893\nAnd this is something I don't do a great\ndeal of, you were talking about,\n\n324\n00:17:39.893 --> 00:17:42.694\nnot having a lot of context for\nwhat D2 and C2 are.\n\n325\n00:17:42.694 --> 00:17:45.934\nIs it possible to take the space, right?\n\n326\n00:17:45.934 --> 00:17:49.880\nThe space index, which is the position,\nspace position, or the length.\n\n327\n00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:51.480\nCould we make those named ranges and\n\n328\n00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.490\nthen actually point those to where\nthey're a little more readable?\n\n329\n00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:58.389\n&gt;&gt; You mean like where D2 is this?\n\n330\n00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:03.160\nWell, the only thing about it is they're\nchanging as we go all the way down.\n\n331\n00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.330\nSo you're saying if I name this, but\n\n332\n00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:11.240\nit's the whole range,\nit's not an individual cells?\n\n333\n00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:16.237\nSo for this one I would want to have,\nlike D2 would be length.\n\n334\n00:18:16.237 --> 00:18:20.976\nC2 would be space, but\nthen when I pull that down,\n\n335\n00:18:20.976 --> 00:18:25.509\nnamed ranges or named cells,\nI couldn't have.\n\n336\n00:18:25.509 --> 00:18:29.440\nI can't make this one name, and then have\nit be the same for each individual cell.\n\n337\n00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:34.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sorry, this is one of those\nthings because I don't use them a lot.\n\n338\n00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:37.000\nAnd I'm kind of jumping outside of\nthe scope of this episode a little bit.\n\n339\n00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:43.430\nI do like readability, but, name rank you\nget them all as a chunk you don't get\n\n340\n00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:48.080\nyou can't do one by one as you go through\neasily we're not saying you can't do it.\n\n341\n00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.995\nThere is probably some crazy\nway with scripting or macros or\n\n342\n00:18:50.995 --> 00:18:52.111\nsomething like that.\n\n343\n00:18:52.111 --> 00:18:53.154\n&gt;&gt; For this example,\n\n344\n00:18:53.154 --> 00:18:56.617\nthe way that we are wanting to do\nthe same thing all the way down.\n\n345\n00:18:56.617 --> 00:19:01.419\nWe're only doing 5, if we had 500, we\nwould wanna use that relative reference,\n\n346\n00:19:01.419 --> 00:19:04.120\nto go ahead and\njust change the cell reference.\n\n347\n00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:07.350\nBut I like the way you're thinking,\nand that's the whole reason for\n\n348\n00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:08.360\nusing named ranges.\n\n349\n00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:09.350\nIf you don't know what that is,\n\n350\n00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:14.040\ngo back into the Excel,\nactually no, it's in this series.\n\n351\n00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.340\nWe talk about named ranges\nwithin the Excel functions.\n\n352\n00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:19.800\nSo definitely go back and check that out,\nbecause it is very very handy.\n\n353\n00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:25.630\nIf I was doing that within one\ncalculation that I would want to say,\n\n354\n00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:29.610\ntake the principle, or you were giving\nme some math lessons of velocity times\n\n355\n00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:33.121\ndistance times something with\na triangle and things like that.\n\n356\n00:19:33.121 --> 00:19:33.870\n[LAUGH].\n\n357\n00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:38.430\nBut you could name it,\nif it was just one single formula.\n\n358\n00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:39.780\nAnd that would help it.\n\n359\n00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:42.960\nFor this particular example, not so much.\n\n360\n00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:48.700\nBut other places, yes, that might\nbe able to be very helpful for you.\n\n361\n00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:53.680\nUsing words, to go ahead and refer to\na cell rather than just a cell reference.\n\n362\n00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.920\nSo I like you're thinking and\nI like the track that you're on.\n\n363\n00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:00.193\nSo, but from everything that I know,\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n364\n00:20:00.193 --> 00:20:03.777\nthrow that out there, it wouldn't work for\nthis particular example.\n\n365\n00:20:03.777 --> 00:20:09.059\nSo, but hopefully these two examples that\nwe have with the extracting the color and\n\n366\n00:20:09.059 --> 00:20:11.549\nthe varying length, using the fine and\n\n367\n00:20:11.549 --> 00:20:15.642\nthe length gives you some examples\nof where you could go with it.\n\n368\n00:20:15.642 --> 00:20:19.645\nThere will be other examples in\nthe library later when we just come to our\n\n369\n00:20:19.645 --> 00:20:20.320\nexamples.\n\n370\n00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.390\nThere you go.\n\n371\n00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:23.435\nI'm just going to stop.\n\n372\n00:20:23.435 --> 00:20:26.270\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Alright, well there you have it.\n\n373\n00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:28.840\nUsing len though it seems like a len.\n\n374\n00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:30.360\nWho cares?\nThere's a couple got you's.\n\n375\n00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.560\nDon't forget about those spaces.\n\n376\n00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:38.520\nYou may have to use other things in\nconjunction, that's not even a word.\n\n377\n00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:43.870\nConjunction with len in order to get\na more uniform len calculation but\n\n378\n00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:45.920\nalso they can be used to slice and dice.\n\n379\n00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:50.320\nSo can be very powerful if kinda\nbolted on with the other tools.\n\n380\n00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:51.190\nBut definitely stay tuned.\n\n381\n00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:53.570\nWe've got more excel functions\ncoming at you, but for this episode,\n\n382\n00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:55.140\nwe're going to go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n383\n00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:56.820\nSo signing off for all OfficeProTV.\n\n384\n00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:57.860\nI'm your host Justin Dennison.\n\n385\n00:20:57.860 --> 00:20:58.382\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n386\n00:20:58.382 --> 00:21:00.350\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.390\nI'm your host Justin Dennison, and well,\n\n4\n00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.370\nwe're coming back with\nmore Excel functions.\n\n5\n00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.350\nAnd well, this one's shrouded\nin a little bit of mystery,\n\n6\n00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.770\nbecause our title is just a single word,\nif.\n\n7\n00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.880\nBut we'll have to see how that plays\nout and if she can manage to keep\n\n8\n00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.320\neverything kinda on a straight and narrow,\nI think she'll help us figure it out.\n\n9\n00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.590\nThe one and only Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n10\n00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.750\nHow are you doing today, Vonne?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing pretty good, how about you?\n\n11\n00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.305\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fine myself and well,\n\n12\n00:00:40.305 --> 00:00:43.280\nif seems like just one word, Vonne.\n\n13\n00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.535\nWhat could there possibly\nbe with the word if?\n\n14\n00:00:45.535 --> 00:00:48.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, it's if happens,\n\n15\n00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.580\nthen something.\n\n16\n00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.070\nIf, then, else, okay?\n\n17\n00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.840\nIf you eat all your dinner\nthen you get a cookie.\n\n18\n00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.450\nElse you don't get anything,\nand what do you do?\n\n19\n00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.670\nYou force it down because\nyou really want that cookie,\n\n20\n00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.530\nso it's a condition, and we've actually\ntalked about this in other episodes.\n\n21\n00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.900\nWe've done some ifs, average ifs,\nand it was a criteria.\n\n22\n00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.520\nAnd there was a specific function that\nwas attached to it that we wanted to do.\n\n23\n00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.010\nWell, if function in it's own.\n\n24\n00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.790\nProbably one of the most used or\nthe most popular functions in Excel.\n\n25\n00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.510\nCuz it's a lot of times what we're trying\nto do when we're analyzing our data.\n\n26\n00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:34.532\nWell, if our sales were this way and then\ncalculate this particular other field.\n\n27\n00:01:34.532 --> 00:01:37.340\nAnd it's we have already done\nthat in other functions.\n\n28\n00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.860\nYeah I know, but this where we are just\nsimplifying it and just taking the if\n\n29\n00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.890\nstatement and keeping it very simple in\nthis episode of a single if statement.\n\n30\n00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.680\nWe are not going to get into nested\nifs in this particular episode.\n\n31\n00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.760\nThere will be others and lots of examples.\n\n32\n00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.300\nBut you will see this function a lot.\n\n33\n00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.790\nSo just getting a very basic understanding\nabout it at first is going to help you\n\n34\n00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.010\nstart using it a little bit more advanced\nand get a little bit more creative.\n\n35\n00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:14.250\nBut the logic is,\nif this is true then do this.\n\n36\n00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.970\nOtherwise, something else.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n37\n00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.250\nwell that's a lot of kind of\nnavigating various paths.\n\n38\n00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.520\nSo I'm kind of interested.\n\n39\n00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.820\nI know how it works in my world.\n\n40\n00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.840\nI'm kind of interested to\nsee how if works in Excel.\n\n41\n00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.560\nMaybe I'm having a little trouble.\n\n42\n00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.900\nMaybe I'm over thinking it a little bit.\n\n43\n00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.220\nIs it easier than it sounds?\n\n44\n00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.730\nOr are there some gotchas\nthat we need to be aware of?\n\n45\n00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.180\n&gt;&gt; Well unlike your language, and\n\n46\n00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.748\nit's funny.\n\n47\n00:02:38.748 --> 00:02:43.650\n[LAUGH] We filmed your if\nepisodes right before this one.\n\n48\n00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.940\nWe're on the if train, that is for sure.\n\n49\n00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.550\nIt's not as complicated in a sense\nof yours is make sure you indent,\n\n50\n00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.080\nmake sure it's in the right places.\n\n51\n00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.530\nAnd you kind of went right in and\nnested if statements.\n\n52\n00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.465\nSo the nice thing is that we have\nthe insert function dialog box that's\n\n53\n00:03:00.465 --> 00:03:01.400\ngonna help us.\n\n54\n00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.620\nAnd now we're gonna take it maybe one\nother level up from the episodes we\n\n55\n00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.210\njust filmed in DevProTV of how we're gonna\nbe doing calculations and everything.\n\n56\n00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.420\nCuz that's normally what\nyou're gonna wanna do.\n\n57\n00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.980\nSo let's jump on down, see what it does,\nand then you can go ahead and\n\n58\n00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.180\ntell me if it's easier or\nmore complicated for you.\n\n59\n00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.660\nThen again,\nwe all come from different places, so\n\n60\n00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.290\nthat's why our perspective\nmight be slightly different.\n\n61\n00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.300\nJust wanted to kind of pull this up\nto just show you that we have an,\n\n62\n00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.080\nif something is true, then do something.\n\n63\n00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.190\nOtherwise, do something else, exactly.\n\n64\n00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.910\nSo I know you have in your language,\nyou have else as an actual keyword.\n\n65\n00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:44.060\nThis is kind of already implied into it,\nand so we're going to go with it.\n\n66\n00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.470\nSo we have our logical tests.\n\n67\n00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.690\nFor example, something like if C2\nequals yes, then type in a one.\n\n68\n00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.150\nIf not, then type in a two, okay?\n\n69\n00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.480\nInstead of doing their examples,\nwe're gonna do our examples, okay?\n\n70\n00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.590\nI have a file called if_simple, okay?\n\n71\n00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.100\nSo let's just go through,\nI have a couple different variations or\n\n72\n00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.040\ndifferent examples to try,\nthat's gonna get you thinking on this if.\n\n73\n00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.140\nSo let's talk about this one first.\n\n74\n00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:17.590\nIf sales are greater than $500\nthen we wanna put the word yes.\n\n75\n00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.640\nIf not, then no.\n\n76\n00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.600\nSo I'd like to say right here,\nis this greater than $500, yes.\n\n77\n00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.010\nYes, no.\n\n78\n00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.840\nNo, yes.\n\n79\n00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.440\nNo, well, is it greater than?\n\n80\n00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.200\nThis is where we have to be\ncareful about our operators.\n\n81\n00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.580\nThat would be a no.\n\n82\n00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.440\nThe answer is 500.\n\n83\n00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.650\nThat would be greater than or equal to.\n\n84\n00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.100\nSo understanding about our comparison\noperators are going to be very important\n\n85\n00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.440\nto understand what you\nare actually asking for.\n\n86\n00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.100\nOkay cuz greater than, or greater than or\nequal to, very different things.\n\n87\n00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.020\nAnd then that will be no.\n\n88\n00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.200\nSo I would like to print that right here.\n\n89\n00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.060\nWhat if I only have 9, I have 9,000.\n\n90\n00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.299\nYou're gonna wanna write an if statement.\n\n91\n00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.150\nLet's go to the insert function\ndialogue box, make this easier.\n\n92\n00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.770\nSo cell selected where we want\nto go ahead and put this in.\n\n93\n00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.830\nYou can type in if and then click Go\nto find the particular one you want.\n\n94\n00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.340\nThis isn't on our logical group so\nif you wanted to go into the logical and\n\n95\n00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.642\nreference you could go, that's look up,\nthat is not, that is just logical, sorry.\n\n96\n00:05:21.642 --> 00:05:23.020\n[LAUGH] And there is our if.\n\n97\n00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.670\nSorry, I just double-clicked\non that really quickly.\n\n98\n00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.820\nHere we go, let's look at this.\n\n99\n00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.700\nLogical test is any value or expression\nthat can be evaluated to true and\n\n100\n00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.290\nfalse, okay?\n\n101\n00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:41.113\nWhat if we say if this cell,\nB2, is greater than or\n\n102\n00:05:41.113 --> 00:05:45.993\nequal, we'll go ahead and put equal too.\n\n103\n00:05:45.993 --> 00:05:50.861\nIs it greater than or equal to 500,\nbecause that is what our quota for\n\n104\n00:05:50.861 --> 00:05:53.050\nthis particular company is.\n\n105\n00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.540\nIs this true.\n\n106\n00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.970\nSo this is the statement that\nyou're going to have to write, and\n\n107\n00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.360\nthis is where you can get very creative\nand all those kinds of things.\n\n108\n00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.530\nSo I would like to evaluate,\nis this greater than 500?\n\n109\n00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.980\nIf it is true,\nI'd like you to type in the word YES.\n\n110\n00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.380\nThat is because I'm using\na function dialog box.\n\n111\n00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.540\nWhen I hit the Tab key,\ngonna automatically put that in quotes,\n\n112\n00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.602\nbecause this is a string of text.\n\n113\n00:06:16.602 --> 00:06:18.210\nAll I wanna put in right now.\n\n114\n00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:24.100\nOtherwise, if it's false\nI want you to type in NO,\n\n115\n00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.380\nI'm hitting Tab again just to show you\nthat it is going to put that in quotes.\n\n116\n00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:33.870\nSo see, you could have your three\narguments within your function.\n\n117\n00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.920\nIf before the first comma\nis the logical test,\n\n118\n00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:44.190\nthen what happens if it's true,\nthen what happens if it's false.\n\n119\n00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.100\nSo this is how it looks.\n\n120\n00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.250\nAnd this is what it does.\n\n121\n00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.720\nYou can see that it is working right now,\nbecause it's giving me, yes,\n\n122\n00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.600\nit is evaluating and\ndoing exactly what we told it to.\n\n123\n00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.495\nSo when I click OK, there is YES.\n\n124\n00:06:56.495 --> 00:07:00.160\nDouble-click or click, hold, and\ndrag down to copy the function.\n\n125\n00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:05.660\nAnd then we can see, yep,\nbecause we did greater than or\n\n126\n00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.790\nequal to 500, we'll get a YES.\n\n127\n00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:12.950\nAnd that's the basic syntax of\nan if statement within Excel.\n\n128\n00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:16.890\nHow you're doing so far there Justin?\n&gt;&gt; I'm just trying to map this to\n\n129\n00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:17.600\nthings I already knew.\n\n130\n00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.980\nThis is pretty straightforward, but if I,\nother than the text, if I wanted to\n\n131\n00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:27.120\nmaybe do something else, there are other\nways of accomplishing similar things.\n\n132\n00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.930\nLike conditional formatting or\nsomething like that,\n\n133\n00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:34.640\nis that the opposite side of this coin?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] This is, it's so funny.\n\n134\n00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.650\nBecause you can start going\ndown the rabbit hole.\n\n135\n00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:40.500\nWell, you could do it this way, you\ncould do it that way, you could do that.\n\n136\n00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.580\nYeah, it's just depending on\nwhat is the end result for you.\n\n137\n00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:48.750\nNow, conditional formatting is more\nof a visual, I could take this and\n\n138\n00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:51.980\nsay if it is greater\nthan 500 make it green.\n\n139\n00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:58.172\nThat's a visual representation and it is\nformatting, I am conditionally formatting.\n\n140\n00:07:58.172 --> 00:08:02.640\nThis is just giving me a result.\n\n141\n00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.920\nAnd this is a very simple one of yes or\nno.\n\n142\n00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:12.740\nThen we start taking it to another level\nand what if we start doing calculations?\n\n143\n00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:15.950\nMore advanced logical statements.\n\n144\n00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:17.780\nLike what am I evaluating?\n\n145\n00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:21.681\nAnd so, let's keep going with\nsome other examples right here.\n\n146\n00:08:21.681 --> 00:08:25.046\nThen, we're just trying to get\na foundational knowledge of if\n\n147\n00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:26.195\nstatements, okay?\n\n148\n00:08:26.195 --> 00:08:31.680\nSo, if your brains going like, there's\nthis way and that way, I get it, okay?\n\n149\n00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.750\nThat is what Excel does.\n\n150\n00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:36.340\nWe just did this like logic is hard, okay?\n\n151\n00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.820\nAnd we're just taking about ifs.\n\n152\n00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.154\nWe haven't even gotten into\nthe other logical stuff.\n\n153\n00:08:41.154 --> 00:08:43.620\nWell, if you're watching in order.\n\n154\n00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:47.300\nSo now,\nlet's go with if sales are greater than or\n\n155\n00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:51.840\nequal to 500,\nthe cat receives 10% of the sales, okay?\n\n156\n00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:57.270\nSo here is our sales representatives,\nright and they have sales.\n\n157\n00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:01.190\nAnd if they meet their quota or\ntheir sales number,\n\n158\n00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:06.190\nthen they get a 10% bonus on\nthe number of your sales, right?\n\n159\n00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:08.110\nPretty straight forward.\n\n160\n00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:09.530\nLet's go ahead and write it.\n\n161\n00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:14.404\nI'm gonna do another way of getting\ninto the interfunctionality box, okay?\n\n162\n00:09:14.404 --> 00:09:18.340\nBecause I definitely like to use\nthis when I'm doing if statements.\n\n163\n00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:22.680\nI started typing it out, so I said equals\nif and then opened the parenthesis.\n\n164\n00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.520\nAnd then I'm gonna click on the Insert\nFunction button right here to jump\n\n165\n00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:31.630\ninto it and\nget me into the parameters of it.\n\n166\n00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:32.940\nSo what is the logical test?\n\n167\n00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:40.000\nIf this cell, so take the cell,\nis it greater than or equal to and\n\n168\n00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.650\nwe're typing in 500 because again, that's\nthe same statement as we did before.\n\n169\n00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:45.700\nThis is my test.\n\n170\n00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.440\nBut if it is true,\n\n171\n00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:51.490\nwe don't want this to print yes,\nI want it to do the calculation.\n\n172\n00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:58.750\nAll right, well then, take the sales and\nthen multiply it by 10%.\n\n173\n00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:00.570\nGive them their bonus.\n\n174\n00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:04.861\nYou can see it's working because\nit's 56 and that's 10% of $560.\n\n175\n00:10:04.861 --> 00:10:09.250\nAnd if they didn't get it,\nthey just get a N/A or\n\n176\n00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:14.790\nlike nope or like try again or\nsorry Charlie or whatever\n\n177\n00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:18.110\nyou want to print out in that particular\nlike you didn't make your bonus.\n\n178\n00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:22.700\nAnd I wanna make sure that I can see that,\nso that is my false.\n\n179\n00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.210\nIf I just, let me just stop right there.\n\n180\n00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:29.570\nI click okay and click hold and\ndrag, copy it down.\n\n181\n00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:32.860\nNope, nope, nope, some people did,\nsome people didn't.\n\n182\n00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.690\nJust for fun, okay, let's take this out.\n\n183\n00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:38.760\nAnd what if I didn't\nput anything in there?\n\n184\n00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.610\nWhat if I came into here and\njust left this blank?\n\n185\n00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:45.680\nI just don't want to put\nanything if it's false.\n\n186\n00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.060\nAnd then you copy it down.\n\n187\n00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.380\nIt's just going to say the word false,\nokay?\n\n188\n00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:55.410\nSo you do need to put\nsomething in there and\n\n189\n00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:59.110\nI think that might be a little different\nthan some of your language because\n\n190\n00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:02.430\nit's always going to put out,\nit's almost like an else,\n\n191\n00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:07.150\nlike there's always an else in here and\nyou have to type something in of\n\n192\n00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:12.258\nwhat you want it to spit out.\n&gt;&gt; What if I in the function download box,\n\n193\n00:11:12.258 --> 00:11:13.980\nwhat if I just put quote, quote?\n\n194\n00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:18.442\nDoes that still put false or\n\n195\n00:11:18.442 --> 00:11:22.652\ndo I now get esentially empty cells.\n&gt;&gt; Like\n\n196\n00:11:22.652 --> 00:11:23.402\nthat?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n197\n00:11:23.402 --> 00:11:27.341\nthat is kind of what I anticipated for\njust leaving it empty but\n\n198\n00:11:27.341 --> 00:11:32.770\nthats making you be explicit about that\nis probably better in all honestly.\n\n199\n00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:36.360\nLike you want nothing in this,\nthen put quote, quote,\n\n200\n00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.560\nwhich is empty string, nothing in there.\n&gt;&gt; Or\n\n201\n00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.190\nzero.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, zero.\n\n202\n00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:43.090\n&gt;&gt; If I wanted it to be $0 and by the way,\n\n203\n00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:46.730\nthese cells were already formatted\nas accounting, just so you know.\n\n204\n00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:48.080\nThat was preformatted.\n\n205\n00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:52.310\nSo if I take that,\nthen in this sense it's blank, okay?\n\n206\n00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:55.530\nBut at least it's like, nope,\nthere is nothing in there, okay?\n\n207\n00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:59.880\nSo string of text,\nI wanna say zero like the word zero.\n\n208\n00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.370\nIf I was and again,\nthat's why I like the dialog box.\n\n209\n00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:05.310\nIt would put those quotes\naround the string or zero.\n\n210\n00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:08.430\nOr if you leave it completely blank,\nit will say false.\n\n211\n00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.710\nGood point to say, I need to put this in.\n\n212\n00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:17.080\nAs a separate variation, same idea.\n\n213\n00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:23.430\nBut I was hard coding those numbers into\nthe calculations within the if statement.\n\n214\n00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:29.433\nAnd that's something like maybe your quota\nchanges, what if your bonus changes?\n\n215\n00:12:29.433 --> 00:12:34.489\nThen, using those as cell references and\nthen using absolute\n\n216\n00:12:34.489 --> 00:12:40.045\nreferences might make it a little\nbit more flexible for you, okay?\n\n217\n00:12:40.045 --> 00:12:43.110\nSo let's try the same thing,\nthe same idea, right?\n\n218\n00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:50.140\nSo the scenario hasn't changed,\nwe're going to come into the dialogue box.\n\n219\n00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:51.220\nSo, same idea.\n\n220\n00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:54.260\nIs this cell greater than or equal to?\n\n221\n00:12:54.260 --> 00:13:00.630\nBut this time we're not typing in 500\nbecause the quota is in a cell reference.\n\n222\n00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.700\nThe actual number is here.\n\n223\n00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:08.297\nSo I'm comparing,\nis B2 560 greater than or\n\n224\n00:13:08.297 --> 00:13:12.128\nequal to G2, the quota, okay?\n\n225\n00:13:12.128 --> 00:13:18.770\nThat's good, well, if it is true,\nsame idea, take the total sales times,\n\n226\n00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:24.040\nso I'm typing in the multiplication,\nthe asterisk.\n\n227\n00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.590\nTimes here.\n\n228\n00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:29.100\nNotice that the cell is formatted\nwith the percent sign and\n\n229\n00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.260\nit is in a percentage cell formatting.\n\n230\n00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.300\nSo cell formatting and all those\nthings do make a difference here.\n\n231\n00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:38.840\nTake that if it is false, right?\n\n232\n00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.160\nThen you just receive a standard bonus.\n\n233\n00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:46.000\nThe standard bonus is here, so I did\nchange the variable, the scenario, sorry,\n\n234\n00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.122\nslightly, then you just get $5.\n\n235\n00:13:48.122 --> 00:13:50.960\nIt's like we get five bucks for showing\nup and trying to sell for the week.\n\n236\n00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:56.230\nNot too bad [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH] and\nthere we go.\n\n237\n00:13:56.230 --> 00:14:00.310\nI've got it, we click okay and\nthat gives me 56.\n\n238\n00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:03.650\nYou already know it's coming if you\nunderstand what absolute values mean.\n\n239\n00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:06.860\nBecause if you try to pull that down,\nit's gonna stop.\n\n240\n00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:10.240\nBecause there are certain things\nwhen you start using cell references\n\n241\n00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:14.530\nas opposed to the hard coded values\nlike typing in 500 and times 10%,\n\n242\n00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:17.590\nis that you need to\nabsolute reference this.\n\n243\n00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:19.520\nSo let's get into this function.\n\n244\n00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:24.180\nAnd let's look that I want to relatively\nchange the sales, so that stays.\n\n245\n00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:27.210\nBut G2, the quota, that needs to be fixed.\n\n246\n00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:30.390\nWe got to put our dollar signs or\nF4 in there, okay?\n\n247\n00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:34.870\nWe don't want the B2 to change, so that's,\nI'm sorry, we want to keep that relative.\n\n248\n00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:39.840\nThis has to stay the same and\nthe standard bonus has to stay the same.\n\n249\n00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.175\nSo we have to absolute reference or\n\n250\n00:14:42.175 --> 00:14:46.910\nfix those particular cells in this,\nthat formula should not change.\n\n251\n00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:48.550\nThe result of that\nformula shouldn't change.\n\n252\n00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:53.170\nIt's the rest of them we copied down that,\nyep, that's exactly what happened.\n\n253\n00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:58.376\nAnd so, gets that standard bonus but\nPumpkin did pretty good,\n\n254\n00:14:58.376 --> 00:15:01.779\nhe got $70 in his bonus ship, bonus check.\n\n255\n00:15:01.779 --> 00:15:07.088\nThat's more of a cat treats for Feugo,\nwhich he would be very happy with.\n\n256\n00:15:07.088 --> 00:15:13.600\nBut what if there was a separate, so\nlike hey, if this happens, that's one way.\n\n257\n00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.950\nBut if you go the other way,\nyou're gonna get another one.\n\n258\n00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:20.440\nAgain, this is more of the else,\nmore of the else statement.\n\n259\n00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.380\nBut you can use that as a calculation.\n\n260\n00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:28.887\nSo let's see, if the cat cell is more\nthan 150 units, that's including 150.\n\n261\n00:15:28.887 --> 00:15:31.670\nJust another way of saying greater than or\nequal to.\n\n262\n00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:34.680\nThen they receive a 20%\nbonus of their sales.\n\n263\n00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:38.680\nBut if it is below 150,\nmeaning that it's false,\n\n264\n00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:42.370\nthen they will receive a bonus\nof 10% of their sales.\n\n265\n00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:46.883\nOkay, so you can have multiple\ncalculations in here for\n\n266\n00:15:46.883 --> 00:15:50.057\nyour If and Else or your True and False.\n\n267\n00:15:50.057 --> 00:15:54.577\nAnd the unit price by the way,\nsales is just taking the unit\n\n268\n00:15:54.577 --> 00:15:59.203\nprice times the price per unit,\nas an absolute reference.\n\n269\n00:15:59.203 --> 00:16:03.054\nSo we will take this,\njump into the function, and\n\n270\n00:16:03.054 --> 00:16:05.540\nwhat is our logical statement?\n\n271\n00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:09.340\nIs B2 greater than or equal to, and\n\n272\n00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:13.404\nwe want this to be 150 hard coding.\n\n273\n00:16:13.404 --> 00:16:15.861\nAgain, could have made a cell reference.\n\n274\n00:16:15.861 --> 00:16:19.480\nIf it is true, nope,\nthat's the wrong cell, isn't it?\n\n275\n00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:23.274\nThat is not what we want,\n\n276\n00:16:23.274 --> 00:16:28.157\nwe want the sales times 20%.\n\n277\n00:16:28.157 --> 00:16:32.548\nAnd if it's false,\nyou still get a little bit of a bonus, and\n\n278\n00:16:32.548 --> 00:16:35.141\nthat's going to be 10%, okay?\n\n279\n00:16:35.141 --> 00:16:40.410\nSo different places where we can put the\nformulas or calculations within the ifs\n\n280\n00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:45.693\nand the elses, not really it's the false,\nthe trues and the false.\n\n281\n00:16:45.693 --> 00:16:50.219\nI should probably go ahead and go with\nthat, so just different variations.\n\n282\n00:16:50.219 --> 00:16:53.411\nAll right, what about dates?\n\n283\n00:16:53.411 --> 00:16:55.713\nThis is the fun one, okay?\n\n284\n00:16:55.713 --> 00:17:01.787\nGet ready cuz this is where we have\nto stop thinking like humans, what?\n\n285\n00:17:01.787 --> 00:17:03.730\nI know, that's crazy.\n\n286\n00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:09.103\nWe want to determine the past due\nstatus for these companies, right?\n\n287\n00:17:09.103 --> 00:17:14.052\nPrancing Parrots and\nPerfect Polish Nails Accessories.\n\n288\n00:17:14.052 --> 00:17:18.930\nAcro Cats, by the way, that is a real\ncompany and they have performing cats.\n\n289\n00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:21.758\nI've seen their performance, it's amazing.\n\n290\n00:17:21.758 --> 00:17:25.720\n[LAUGH] Sorry, Justin's face\nare over there, is like wait what?\n\n291\n00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.136\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm like all right, so\n\n292\n00:17:27.136 --> 00:17:28.498\ndon't get this camera on me,\n\n293\n00:17:28.498 --> 00:17:29.867\nI gotta go look these cats up.\n\n294\n00:17:29.867 --> 00:17:30.943\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n295\n00:17:30.943 --> 00:17:33.061\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty amazing.\n\n296\n00:17:33.061 --> 00:17:33.981\n&gt;&gt; I don't doubt it.\n\n297\n00:17:33.981 --> 00:17:34.673\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n298\n00:17:34.673 --> 00:17:37.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cats are interesting animals.\n\n299\n00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:37.681\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's awesome.\n\n300\n00:17:37.681 --> 00:17:41.451\nSo anyway, sorry, total derailment\nright there for just a minute.\n\n301\n00:17:41.451 --> 00:17:43.032\nThe rest of them, are completely made up.\n\n302\n00:17:43.032 --> 00:17:47.872\nSo the status, if they're 30\ndays past due, then I'd like for\n\n303\n00:17:47.872 --> 00:17:49.721\npast due to show up here.\n\n304\n00:17:49.721 --> 00:17:52.062\nAnd if not, then say okay.\n\n305\n00:17:52.062 --> 00:17:53.920\nSo let's look at this.\n\n306\n00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:58.874\nRight now, the time that we're recording,\nit is April 30th, 2018.\n\n307\n00:17:58.874 --> 00:18:00.643\nIs that past due there, Justin?\n\n308\n00:18:00.643 --> 00:18:05.700\nIs Dancing Dogs past due on their bill?\n&gt;&gt; They're past due, delinquent,\n\n309\n00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:09.695\ncashed out, they're in collections.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Correct,\n\n310\n00:18:09.695 --> 00:18:13.332\nnow let's say that this one.\n\n311\n00:18:13.332 --> 00:18:15.573\nAre they 30 days past due?\n&gt;&gt; They're not,\n\n312\n00:18:15.573 --> 00:18:17.742\nthat's actually in the future\nfrom the time of this recording.\n\n313\n00:18:17.742 --> 00:18:20.322\nSo they still got\na little while to pay up.\n\n314\n00:18:20.322 --> 00:18:22.265\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so this should be okay, and\n\n315\n00:18:22.265 --> 00:18:23.680\nthis should be past due.\n\n316\n00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:27.849\nOkay, well let's go ahead and\ntype it out, okay?\n\n317\n00:18:27.849 --> 00:18:30.793\nYou're like, I feel like you're\nprepping this up for this not to work.\n\n318\n00:18:30.793 --> 00:18:31.691\nYeah, that's right.\n\n319\n00:18:31.691 --> 00:18:34.802\nSo if we go ahead and\nclick If, and we start this.\n\n320\n00:18:34.802 --> 00:18:37.362\nSo what is our logical test?\n\n321\n00:18:37.362 --> 00:18:39.270\nAnd I'm combining a couple\ndifferent things in here.\n\n322\n00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:43.075\nSo if you have not watched the Today and\nnow episode,\n\n323\n00:18:43.075 --> 00:18:46.373\ncheck that out,\ncuz I'm putting it in here.\n\n324\n00:18:46.373 --> 00:18:49.891\nSo we're going to say that I want B2,\nright?\n\n325\n00:18:49.891 --> 00:18:55.043\nThis date, I want to see,\nif it's 30 days past due.\n\n326\n00:18:55.043 --> 00:18:58.252\nSo you're gonna say minus today,\na function,\n\n327\n00:18:58.252 --> 00:19:00.912\nopen parenthesis close parenthesis.\n\n328\n00:19:00.912 --> 00:19:08.464\nOkay, so taking that and we wanna say\nif this is actually greater than 30.\n\n329\n00:19:08.464 --> 00:19:12.750\nAll right, if it's more than 30 days\npast due, cuz that make sense, right?\n\n330\n00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:18.234\nToday minus January 1, 2017,\nthat's gonna definitely be a big number.\n\n331\n00:19:18.234 --> 00:19:21.482\nIt's like 400 something days past due.\n\n332\n00:19:21.482 --> 00:19:27.042\nSo if it is true, then I'd like\nyou to just type in past due.\n\n333\n00:19:27.042 --> 00:19:29.933\nOoh, what'd I just do there?\n\n334\n00:19:29.933 --> 00:19:34.898\nOkay, past due, so there we go.\n\n335\n00:19:34.898 --> 00:19:38.011\nAll right,\nthat must have hit something weird, and\n\n336\n00:19:38.011 --> 00:19:42.271\nthen if it's false we're gonna say,\nwe're okay, you're all good.\n\n337\n00:19:42.271 --> 00:19:43.910\nThose are all strains of text.\n\n338\n00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:48.101\nIt is saying that it is volatile because\ntoday's day is gonna change, we click OK.\n\n339\n00:19:48.101 --> 00:19:53.070\nAnd then if I scroll back over here, What?\n\n340\n00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:56.652\nWait, but you told me, we're smiling\nbecause Justin knows what's coming.\n\n341\n00:19:56.652 --> 00:19:57.711\nWe do practice this.\n\n342\n00:19:57.711 --> 00:20:01.992\n[LAUGH] I'm like this is all\nsorts of wrong, so wait a second.\n\n343\n00:20:01.992 --> 00:20:08.870\nIt's telling me that something\nin June 1st is past due.\n\n344\n00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:11.550\nI'm totally confused right now.\n\n345\n00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:15.180\nI will say that I've actually like I\nlooked this up, and I found a tutorial\n\n346\n00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:19.063\nthat told you to do it exactly the same\nway, and we're like that's not right.\n\n347\n00:20:19.063 --> 00:20:23.350\nThere's something really wrong about this,\nso\n\n348\n00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:27.435\nI don't understand, but\nthis is in the past.\n\n349\n00:20:27.435 --> 00:20:28.121\nSo Justin,\n\n350\n00:20:28.121 --> 00:20:30.305\ndo you wanna take it away there?\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n351\n00:20:30.305 --> 00:20:35.262\nthis is where things get a little heady,\nbecause we think of we tend to,\n\n352\n00:20:35.262 --> 00:20:40.222\nwhen we say past, when we use\nthe language past, in the past or behind,\n\n353\n00:20:40.222 --> 00:20:44.953\nthere's actually an implicit\nnegative with numbers, all right?\n\n354\n00:20:44.953 --> 00:20:48.354\nAlso the way numbers, or excuse me,\ndates are represented in Excel,\n\n355\n00:20:48.354 --> 00:20:50.094\nthey're represented as numbers.\n\n356\n00:20:50.094 --> 00:20:54.560\nToday is a bigger number than yesterday.\n\n357\n00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:59.062\nAnd so if we take yesterday minus today,\nwe're gonna get a negative number.\n\n358\n00:20:59.062 --> 00:21:03.123\nIt's kind of a odd thing to think about.\n&gt;&gt; And let's pause right there and\n\n359\n00:21:03.123 --> 00:21:04.546\ndemonstrate this.\n\n360\n00:21:04.546 --> 00:21:10.652\nAll right, well let's just do what you\njust said, okay, so let's say this, right?\n\n361\n00:21:10.652 --> 00:21:16.002\nMinus today,\nwhich is what we just typed in there.\n\n362\n00:21:16.002 --> 00:21:20.945\nThat's, sorry, that's gonna be a really\nstrange number because it thinks\n\n363\n00:21:20.945 --> 00:21:25.911\nit's a date, and there, it's saying\nthat this is a negative number, right?\n\n364\n00:21:25.911 --> 00:21:27.011\nBut for us,\n\n365\n00:21:27.011 --> 00:21:31.427\nwe're thinking it's 400 days in the past.\n\n366\n00:21:31.427 --> 00:21:32.198\n&gt;&gt; And-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n367\n00:21:32.198 --> 00:21:33.136\n&gt;&gt; As a matter of fact,\n\n368\n00:21:33.136 --> 00:21:35.741\nwhen you say 400 days in the past,\nthat is negative.\n\n369\n00:21:35.741 --> 00:21:39.455\nSo when you think past, and this is one\nof those things where people are like,\n\n370\n00:21:39.455 --> 00:21:41.350\nwhy do we need negative numbers?\n\n371\n00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:43.301\nNegative numbers,\nall they talk about is direction.\n\n372\n00:21:43.301 --> 00:21:46.091\nAre we moving backwards or\nforwards effectively.\n\n373\n00:21:46.091 --> 00:21:51.793\nSo it's -484 days ago,\nis when that date elapsed.\n\n374\n00:21:51.793 --> 00:21:56.341\nBut we use the word past\nas a substitute for this.\n\n375\n00:21:56.341 --> 00:21:59.902\nWe're like it should be 30 or\nsome positive number.\n\n376\n00:21:59.902 --> 00:22:03.968\nSo it gets a little iffy, because we\nthink of numbers differently or dates,\n\n377\n00:22:03.968 --> 00:22:06.482\nrespectively, differently.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\n\n378\n00:22:06.482 --> 00:22:12.026\nthat's where this result of\nthe formula will always be negative,\n\n379\n00:22:12.026 --> 00:22:16.186\na negative number can\nnever be greater than 30.\n\n380\n00:22:16.186 --> 00:22:19.936\nSo while we're thinking of it as,\nwell, we need to subtract that,\n\n381\n00:22:19.936 --> 00:22:21.983\nit's actually the other way around.\n\n382\n00:22:21.983 --> 00:22:24.028\nSo we can still make this happen,\n\n383\n00:22:24.028 --> 00:22:27.692\nit's really just more of\nunderstanding of how dates work.\n\n384\n00:22:27.692 --> 00:22:31.280\nAnd like what Justin just said,\ndates or numbers.\n\n385\n00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:35.873\nAnd sometimes it's hard for\nus as humans to think of it that way.\n\n386\n00:22:35.873 --> 00:22:39.541\nTo think like the computer and\nknow what it's doing.\n\n387\n00:22:39.541 --> 00:22:44.859\nSo this still will work, we just have\nto alter this just a little bit.\n\n388\n00:22:44.859 --> 00:22:46.790\nWe just have to flip it.\n\n389\n00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:55.581\nWe have to say today, okay, Minus this\ncell reference, which is B2, okay?\n\n390\n00:22:55.581 --> 00:23:01.378\nSo we just flipped it, which doesn't\ngo in the order that our brains think,\n\n391\n00:23:01.378 --> 00:23:03.923\nwe have to think like a computer.\n\n392\n00:23:03.923 --> 00:23:07.412\nSo now if I click OK,\nnow that is past due.\n\n393\n00:23:07.412 --> 00:23:10.733\nAnd if I click, hold and drag this down,\n\n394\n00:23:10.733 --> 00:23:14.753\nnow everything works\nthe way it's supposed to.\n\n395\n00:23:14.753 --> 00:23:18.430\nAnd if I wanted, if I was doing just\na very simple something like this.\n\n396\n00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:23.158\nI would have to say TODAY- the cell,\nbackwards,\n\n397\n00:23:23.158 --> 00:23:27.331\nthat again, it's formatting it as a date.\n\n398\n00:23:27.331 --> 00:23:30.490\nIt is backwards then\nwhat we think it to be.\n\n399\n00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:34.793\nSo just a little kind of,\nthrowing some logic in there.\n\n400\n00:23:34.793 --> 00:23:39.712\nThrowing some dates in there and\nhow this all works together.\n\n401\n00:23:39.712 --> 00:23:44.442\nAnd that's my last example\nof doing simple ifs.\n\n402\n00:23:44.442 --> 00:23:48.127\nBut again, if you're looking at stuff like\nthat, if I was looking at just the syntax,\n\n403\n00:23:48.127 --> 00:23:49.653\nit would get a little weird, okay?\n\n404\n00:23:49.653 --> 00:23:53.984\nSo use the insert function dialogue\nbox until you get familiar with it.\n\n405\n00:23:53.984 --> 00:23:59.962\nAnd some of those trues and falses can,\nthey can get pretty complicated.\n\n406\n00:23:59.962 --> 00:24:01.721\nYou can nest things inside of those.\n\n407\n00:24:01.721 --> 00:24:04.747\nBut for right now,\nthat's all we're gonna do.\n\n408\n00:24:04.747 --> 00:24:10.761\nSo ifs, if we're done,\nwe're gonna pass it back over to you,\n\n409\n00:24:10.761 --> 00:24:12.023\nJustin.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n410\n00:24:12.023 --> 00:24:12.728\nwell-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n411\n00:24:12.728 --> 00:24:13.542\n&gt;&gt; I guess it's passed back to me.\n\n412\n00:24:13.542 --> 00:24:16.923\nNow, just for clarity,\nif you're like well no,\n\n413\n00:24:16.923 --> 00:24:19.872\nthe opposite makes sense to me,\nthat's fine.\n\n414\n00:24:19.872 --> 00:24:24.002\nBut in interactions with other people,\nI've noticed that whenever we use the word\n\n415\n00:24:24.002 --> 00:24:27.955\npast, sometimes we'll get all twisted\nwhen there's actual numbers around.\n\n416\n00:24:27.955 --> 00:24:30.530\nBecause that's actually a negative number.\n\n417\n00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:33.918\nNotice that Vonne put\nan extra column to calculate,\n\n418\n00:24:33.918 --> 00:24:39.082\nto see what that value was that was being\nevaluated for the condition in the end.\n\n419\n00:24:39.082 --> 00:24:42.212\nI actually recommend that, I do that\na great deal when I'm using Excel.\n\n420\n00:24:42.212 --> 00:24:45.930\nIt allows me to get a quick gut check of,\nhey, does this make sense?\n\n421\n00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:47.511\nNegative, why is that negative?\n\n422\n00:24:47.511 --> 00:24:51.293\nAnd then you're not chasing like why\nis this pass doing okay flipped?\n\n423\n00:24:51.293 --> 00:24:53.750\nYou're not chasing that,\nyou actually see value.\n\n424\n00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:59.582\nSo never be afraid of adding little extra\ncolumns for intermediate calculations.\n\n425\n00:24:59.582 --> 00:25:01.031\nBut you know what?\n\n426\n00:25:01.031 --> 00:25:03.363\nI'm looking at the clock and\nwe are out of time for this episode.\n\n427\n00:25:03.363 --> 00:25:04.864\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n428\n00:25:04.864 --> 00:25:07.772\nSo signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n429\n00:25:07.772 --> 00:25:08.512\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n430\n00:25:08.512 --> 00:25:10.306\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n431\n00:25:10.306 --> 00:25:14.751\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

officepro.tv.\n\n3\n00:00:16.051 --> 00:00:18.468\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and\nyou asked for and so\n\n4\n00:00:18.468 --> 00:00:21.403\nwe're bringing back at you yeah\nthat's more Excel functions and\n\n5\n00:00:21.403 --> 00:00:25.110\nin particular we're gonna be talking about\nand, as well as, or, couldn't use that\n\n6\n00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.430\nother coordinating conjunction there\nbecause it would have gotten confusing.\n\n7\n00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.280\nAnd you're like what are those all about?\n\n8\n00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.370\nWell luckily we've got our resident\nmagician to help us along in that very\n\n9\n00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.470\nendeavor, Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n10\n00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.880\nHow are you doing today Vonne?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing pretty good,\n\n11\n00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.020\nhow about yourself?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic.\n\n12\n00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.730\nNow I know where we're going,\n\n13\n00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.800\nwe're talking about ands and\nors which is a little bit of logic.\n\n14\n00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.010\nThis is something that, well,\nit's kind of in my world, a little bit.\n\n15\n00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.460\nBut I'm kind of interested\nto see how Excel handles\n\n16\n00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.110\nthis.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n17\n00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.470\nand I know you spend\na lot of time in this.\n\n18\n00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.730\nAnd yeah, in your programming,\nin DevProTV,\n\n19\n00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.040\nI've actually been on\nsome of your episodes.\n\n20\n00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.650\nIt's quite enjoyable.\n\n21\n00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.650\nAnd yes, we are talking about logical\nfunctions within Excel today and\n\n22\n00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.000\nwe're gonna start with the AND\nas well as the OR.\n\n23\n00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.960\nYeah, it's really hard.\n\n24\n00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.830\nWe're gonna say and and or\na lot throughout this episode.\n\n25\n00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.060\nAnd we have done actually some other ones.\n\n26\n00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.420\nWe did the IF statement.\n\n27\n00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.470\nThat's a logical function and\nthen the IF which we'll review here today\n\n28\n00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.410\nis we're asking a question and\nthen if this happens,\n\n29\n00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.910\ntrue or false, go ahead and give me\ntwo different responses or results.\n\n30\n00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.460\nSo were gonna bring that back\ninto this particular episode but\n\n31\n00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.640\nwe're gonna concentrate on\nthe other ones and or, woo,\n\n32\n00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.120\nnow this is where the way that we talk as\nhumans and like do you like this and that?\n\n33\n00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.770\nDo you like this or that?\n\n34\n00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.420\nHow we think of it and\nhow we collectively as humans, address it.\n\n35\n00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.131\nIt can get a little different in computer\n\n36\n00:01:59.131 --> 00:02:00.610\nworlds.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n37\n00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.110\nit's funny cuz when we're talking, right?\n\n38\n00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.998\nDo you like this and that?\n\n39\n00:02:04.998 --> 00:02:07.786\nYou're more likely I\nargue to answer yes or\n\n40\n00:02:07.786 --> 00:02:11.490\nno to that question than if you have or\nin there.\n\n41\n00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.560\nDo you like this or that?\n\n42\n00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.150\nYou will not go, yes or no, you go,\n\n43\n00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.350\nwell I like this one not that one,\nlike you'll further clarify.\n\n44\n00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.170\nSo, the OR I have found is sometimes\na little trickier because it's not\n\n45\n00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.750\nour default kind of, yes or no is not our\n\n46\n00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.350\ndefault answer to an OR question.\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n47\n00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.880\nwe always we have to follow it up with\nmore details, so I'll let you know why\n\n48\n00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.130\nI like this one better than that one or\nhow we go about how we talk.\n\n49\n00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.190\nSo we're gonna jump right\nin to exactly that.\n\n50\n00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.045\nI need to ask you some questions, Justin.\n\n51\n00:02:48.045 --> 00:02:51.200\nJustin?\nHow about I first get your name right,\n\n52\n00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.980\nand then we can ask you some questions.\n\n53\n00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.560\nSo let's start.\n\n54\n00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.160\nWe're gonna jump on\ndown into our computer.\n\n55\n00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.220\nSo Justin, do you like cheese?\n&gt;&gt; I do love cheese,\n\n56\n00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.160\nit is delicious.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n57\n00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.810\nyou would say yes?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n58\n00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.790\n&gt;&gt; So the question is, do you like cheese?\n\n59\n00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.516\nYes, well another way that we could\nsay yes in computer talk would be?\n\n60\n00:03:10.516 --> 00:03:11.985\n&gt;&gt; True.\n\n61\n00:03:11.985 --> 00:03:13.695\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n62\n00:03:13.695 --> 00:03:17.980\n[LAUGH] Yes, this is where now we're gonna\nhave to start using all of our words.\n\n63\n00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.570\nSo yes, that is true.\n\n64\n00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.270\nNotice by the way, as soon as typed in\ntrue do you see how it capitalize itself?\n\n65\n00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.440\nOkay, we should go ahead and\nclarify this right now.\n\n66\n00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.020\nIn all of computers really\nin this application,\n\n67\n00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.850\nthere are some like keywords, TRUE and\nFALSE are all over the place.\n\n68\n00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.310\nSo, just so you know,\n\n69\n00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.180\nit's like that didn't actually become like\na keyword, it didn't do anything fancy.\n\n70\n00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.900\nIt just kinda knows to do that to itself.\n\n71\n00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.880\nSo if you're typing that in just,\nI just wanted to throw that out to you.\n\n72\n00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.290\nIt's okay, it's not changing anything in\nthe background, but they are somewhat,\n\n73\n00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.770\nlike, reserved words.\n\n74\n00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.130\nDo you like onions.\n&gt;&gt; No, absolutely not, no.\n\n75\n00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.080\nCan I say no again?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n76\n00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.200\na double no?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n77\n00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.378\n&gt;&gt; So that would be false.\n\n78\n00:04:04.378 --> 00:04:05.913\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n79\n00:04:05.913 --> 00:04:07.450\n&gt;&gt; Olives?\n\n80\n00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.335\n&gt;&gt; I like those less than onions, so no.\n\n81\n00:04:09.335 --> 00:04:10.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] More nos,\n\n82\n00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.590\nso that would be false.\n\n83\n00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.290\nAnd what about mushrooms?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n84\n00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.320\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so that would be true.\n\n85\n00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.290\nOkay, so very simple statements.\n\n86\n00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.390\nWe're just asking a question.\n\n87\n00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:22.490\nWell, how about I come down here?\n\n88\n00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.350\nDo you like cheese and mushrooms?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n89\n00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.420\n&gt;&gt; Okay, which would be true.\n\n90\n00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.400\nWhat about onions and olives?\n\n91\n00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.090\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n92\n00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.640\nSo you don't like either one of those?\n\n93\n00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.570\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n94\n00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.460\nOkay, what about cheese and onions?\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n95\n00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.300\nif there's onions there so no.\n&gt;&gt; So right there,\n\n96\n00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.310\nthat's a clarification of well\nI like cheese but not onions.\n\n97\n00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:53.760\nSo, if you talk about and, you do not like\nthose together, so that would be a no.\n\n98\n00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:00.110\nSo when you're using an and in logical\nstatements or logical operations,\n\n99\n00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.750\nif one of them is false,\nthen the whole thing is false, okay.\n\n100\n00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.850\nThere might be six of them in there,\nyou might like have all five of them but\n\n101\n00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.590\nthat sixth ingredient, yeah,\nwe're talking about pizza.\n\n102\n00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.390\nIt's like, well then you know it.\n\n103\n00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.720\nNo, I cannot have that pizza because\none those elements is not true.\n\n104\n00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.250\nSo then it will always yield a false.\n\n105\n00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.540\nSo what about mushrooms and onions?\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n106\n00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:23.700\n&gt;&gt; Same thing because you\n\n107\n00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:24.740\ndon't like onions.\n\n108\n00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.670\nSo you like mushrooms but\nyou can't like both of them.\n\n109\n00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:32.860\nSo that's just of a way of\ndemonstrating our logical functions.\n\n110\n00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:33.990\nBut now we get to our or,\n\n111\n00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.485\ndo you like cheese or mushrooms?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n112\n00:05:37.485 --> 00:05:40.820\nAnd I'm gonna try to answer yes or no even\nthough this is not typically how we would\n\n113\n00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.471\nanswer or questions.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Onions or\n\n114\n00:05:44.471 --> 00:05:46.220\nolives?\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n115\n00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:48.630\n&gt;&gt; Neither one of them?\n\n116\n00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:49.450\nNeither.\n\n117\n00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.740\nCheese or onion?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n118\n00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.820\n&gt;&gt; Yes, because you like cheese but\n\n119\n00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.327\nnot onions see how that's different\n,when we are doing the, AND, that would\n\n120\n00:06:00.327 --> 00:06:05.338\nyield a no but when you are doing\nit as an OR it yields a yes or\n\n121\n00:06:05.338 --> 00:06:09.470\na true so mushrooms or onions.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n122\n00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:10.670\n&gt;&gt; You like one of them, so\n\n123\n00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.870\nit's going to be yes.\n\n124\n00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.387\nOkay so that's where you just have to\nkind of think about both sides, or\n\n125\n00:06:17.387 --> 00:06:19.130\nmultiple sides.\n\n126\n00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.926\nOr it can be one or\nthe other okay either, okay, but so\n\n127\n00:06:23.926 --> 00:06:27.237\neither, neither, neither, nor.\n\n128\n00:06:27.237 --> 00:06:28.054\nIt can get a little,\n\n129\n00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:30.860\nyou just have to kind of I would\nsay you have to kind of slow down.\n\n130\n00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.670\nAnd really just kind of\nthink about it of what\n\n131\n00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:37.010\nyou're trying to ask of it.\n&gt;&gt; If you're response would be\n\n132\n00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.460\nI like neither, then that's a no.\n\n133\n00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.890\nThat's the only way that you\nget a no answer out of an or\n\n134\n00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:43.820\nstatement is if you say neither.\n\n135\n00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.140\nSo it's kind of a right,\nthey both start with and.\n\n136\n00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.930\nSo you like onions or olives?\n\n137\n00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:48.480\nNeither.\n\n138\n00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.020\nSo no.\n\n139\n00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:54.270\nIf there's yes to one anything else,\nif there's not an either in there,\n\n140\n00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.300\nthen it's a yes.\n&gt;&gt; That's a good way of saying it.\n\n141\n00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:56.857\nI like that,\n\n142\n00:06:56.857 --> 00:06:59.207\nyou've thought logic before, haven't you?\n&gt;&gt; We did.\n\n143\n00:06:59.207 --> 00:07:01.797\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Just a little bit.\n\n144\n00:07:01.797 --> 00:07:04.610\nAll right, so\nwhen we're talking about logical test.\n\n145\n00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.980\nOkay, that's we're testing something here,\n\n146\n00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:12.730\nwe are going to make a test to see like\nokay and this is gonna kind of come\n\n147\n00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:16.380\nback up in our further examples in here\nwhen we get to the and and the or.\n\n148\n00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:21.530\nWe're testing meows more than or equal to.\n\n149\n00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:23.000\nWe're just I'm just\nthrowing this out there.\n\n150\n00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.590\nSo we want to test to see if Sasha cat,\ndid he\n\n151\n00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:32.850\nmeow more than our quota\nif you want to say.\n\n152\n00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:38.800\nWell, that would be is 7 more than or\nequal to 5?\n\n153\n00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.930\nWell, the answer would be yes,\n7 is more than 5.\n\n154\n00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.090\nYou could also take it around to where,\nwhat about the swipes?\n\n155\n00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:47.138\nOkay, like?\n\n156\n00:07:47.138 --> 00:07:51.674\nSwipes, we're gonna be testing if they get\na treat or not, okay, and you need to tell\n\n157\n00:07:51.674 --> 00:07:56.084\nme that you're hungry but you can't swipe\nat me, because if you swipe too much then\n\n158\n00:07:56.084 --> 00:07:59.802\nI'm not giving you a treat, okay, so\nright here we could do a test of.\n\n159\n00:07:59.802 --> 00:08:04.557\nOkay is this Sasha swiped me twice,\nbut our quarter is 3, and\n\n160\n00:08:04.557 --> 00:08:08.673\nit's less than 3, so\nit's 2 less than 3, yes, so\n\n161\n00:08:08.673 --> 00:08:13.711\nyou get the idea of where we're\ngoing to be comparing something.\n\n162\n00:08:13.711 --> 00:08:19.024\nNow greater than or equal to, greater\nthan, less than, you could also do equal,\n\n163\n00:08:19.024 --> 00:08:23.680\nokay, right here, pumpkin or\nmaybe if this was like it has to equal 5.\n\n164\n00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:29.016\nIf anything but 5, it's not gonna work,\nso you could do is 5 equal to 5?\n\n165\n00:08:29.016 --> 00:08:31.120\nYes, is 3 equal to 5?\n\n166\n00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:36.470\nNo, so\nyou can do that type of comparison but\n\n167\n00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:39.190\nyou are going to be\ntesting the waters out.\n\n168\n00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:43.331\nSo just very simple, this has nothing\nto do with the ors to the ifs.\n\n169\n00:08:43.331 --> 00:08:48.987\nThis is just like, you could write\na very simple logical formula or\n\n170\n00:08:48.987 --> 00:08:55.795\ntest to say is this cell greater than, so\nwe have to do the looks like a G, right?\n\n171\n00:08:55.795 --> 00:09:01.860\nOops, that's the equal to, this cell,\nis B7 greater than or equal to B3?\n\n172\n00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.710\nNow, you can see that I have a couple\nof them, so I'd wanna go ahead and\n\n173\n00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:07.010\ncopy this down.\n\n174\n00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:10.730\nSo I would go ahead and absolute\nreference that last cell there because we\n\n175\n00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:12.460\nalways wanna go back and declare the B3.\n\n176\n00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:17.180\nSo I'd go ahead and F4, dollar signs\nin front of the references, and\n\n177\n00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.830\nthen yes, that's true,\nyou pull it on down.\n\n178\n00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.800\nOops, there we go, and\nwe pull it on down and\n\n179\n00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.250\nthere you go, that's always\ngoing to yield a true or false.\n\n180\n00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:29.753\nIt doesn't say yes or no, it's true and\nfalse, that is the result of this\n\n181\n00:09:29.753 --> 00:09:35.185\nparticular logical formula or\nreally logical tests.\n\n182\n00:09:35.185 --> 00:09:39.765\nSo same thing here, I'm just really\nquickly we'll just say is this one less\n\n183\n00:09:39.765 --> 00:09:44.073\nthan this one, absolute reference it,\nhit enter, yes, it's true.\n\n184\n00:09:44.073 --> 00:09:50.172\nAnd the reason I'm doing here is because\nwe're going to now combine those together.\n\n185\n00:09:50.172 --> 00:09:55.245\nTo say, well, you have to make sure\nwe meow more than 5 and don't swipe\n\n186\n00:09:55.245 --> 00:10:01.180\nme three times in a row, so it looks like\nyep, Sasha would win, Pumpkin would win.\n\n187\n00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:05.030\nSo you can kinda get the idea right\nhere of where we're going, but\n\n188\n00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:07.980\nof course we have to learn\nhow to write it in Excel.\n\n189\n00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.790\nLets re read if statement for\na minute, okay?\n\n190\n00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:17.646\nWith the if statement and\nif function, it's just a single test,\n\n191\n00:10:17.646 --> 00:10:22.769\nlet's going to the insult,\n[LAUGH] we're not gonna insult anybody,\n\n192\n00:10:22.769 --> 00:10:29.520\nwe're going to insert dialogue box,\ninsert function we're going to do if.\n\n193\n00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:33.580\nAnd see right there,\nthe logical test is any value or\n\n194\n00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:38.170\nexpression that can be evaluated,\nbut it's just one.\n\n195\n00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:42.040\nI'm saying okay, well,\nif we're just doing a straight meow,\n\n196\n00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.750\nwe're not throwing in the slight fist yet,\nwe're saying just like before,\n\n197\n00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:50.100\nis this cell greater than or\nequal to this cell?\n\n198\n00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.920\nWe know we're gonna copy it, so\nwe're going to have to reference it,\n\n199\n00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:58.550\nthat's the logical test, that's what\nI'm putting in there, just one.\n\n200\n00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:03.390\nAnd then if it is true, I would like\nto type in the word treat, which\n\n201\n00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:07.770\nonce you tab out of it, it puts it in\nquotations because of the string of text.\n\n202\n00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:12.100\nOr if it's false you say, no bad cat,\n\n203\n00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:17.680\nyou can put whatever text you want in\nthere, or numbers, or another equation.\n\n204\n00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.820\nThere's all sorts of different ways,\n\n205\n00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:21.870\nwe're just kinda keeping\nit pretty simple right now.\n\n206\n00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:23.990\nAnd that's our true and our false,\n\n207\n00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:28.490\nwhat is our result, and then,\nwhat am I going to put in there?\n\n208\n00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:30.740\nSo, looks like Fuego and\n\n209\n00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:33.838\nPooma, that they're being bad\nlittle kitties over there.\n\n210\n00:11:33.838 --> 00:11:36.760\nUsually Pooma cuz she's just too nice and\nshe sits in the corner and\n\n211\n00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:41.730\ndoesn't do anything, so, okay,\nFuego, he's used to the bad cat.\n\n212\n00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:47.160\nPerfect, so now when you're doing your if\nstatements, what if I have two conditions?\n\n213\n00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:52.440\nWhat if I need to meow more than 5 and\n\n214\n00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:58.110\nswipe less than 3, that's where you're\ngoing to bring in your and statement.\n\n215\n00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:05.280\nWe're gonna do and by itself just to show\nyou what it does and by itself, it's\n\n216\n00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:11.230\njust gonna yield true or false, that's all\nthat particular function is ever gonna do.\n\n217\n00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:15.890\nSo if all you're looking for is true and\nfalse, use and by itself, but\n\n218\n00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:22.270\nit's more times than not, you're gonna use\nit in conjunction with other functions.\n\n219\n00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:25.690\nThat seems to be a running theme\nthroughout a lot of our functions,\n\n220\n00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:28.860\nit's like this is one piece of another\nbecause these are the things that we're\n\n221\n00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:33.450\nusually asking of our data.\n\n222\n00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:36.920\nThis, if meow and swipe,\nyou get something, okay, so\n\n223\n00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:41.240\nlet's combine it together,\nlet's step it up, and,\n\n224\n00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:45.220\nhow do we do an and, we're gonna do it\nequals, we're gonna type this one out.\n\n225\n00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:49.419\nIt's not too terribly complicated and\nonce I do and,\n\n226\n00:12:49.419 --> 00:12:54.266\nlet's look at what it says,\nit just says argument, it says,\n\n227\n00:12:54.266 --> 00:12:58.790\nargument 1 is logical 1,\nargument 2 is logical 2.\n\n228\n00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:01.871\nAnd you could keep on going, that's like,\n\n229\n00:13:01.871 --> 00:13:06.547\ncheese, onions, pepperoni,\nmushrooms, and salami, right?\n\n230\n00:13:06.547 --> 00:13:08.581\nThat would be a good pizza for\nme, [LAUGH] but\n\n231\n00:13:08.581 --> 00:13:11.420\nthere's onions on yours so\nyou wouldn't like it, right?\n\n232\n00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:15.950\nSo you can have as many\nlogical statements or\n\n233\n00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:20.310\ntests as you would like, so\nbefore just like we did.\n\n234\n00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:24.040\nNow, could I go ahead and\nlike just grab this cell and this cell?\n\n235\n00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:27.800\nTotally, but again, I'm just trying\nto keep it all together for us,\n\n236\n00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:34.610\nwe would say is this cell greater than or\nequal to this cell, absolute reference.\n\n237\n00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:35.720\nThat is the wrong F key,\n\n238\n00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:39.930\nlet's go with that one, so\nthat's the first statement, comma.\n\n239\n00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:43.190\nThen the next statement, or\nI really should be saying condition or\n\n240\n00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:48.000\nlogical test, so\nlet's go with this cell, is less than,\n\n241\n00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.520\nthis cell, absolute reference,\nokay, let's hit enter.\n\n242\n00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:57.621\nAnd yes, cuz two trues, that's a true,\nand we keep on going down and we\n\n243\n00:13:57.621 --> 00:14:03.851\ndrag this down, okay, true, this is gonna\nyield a false because it's gotta be both.\n\n244\n00:14:03.851 --> 00:14:07.017\nThis one is gonna yield a false\nbecause they are both false, and\n\n245\n00:14:07.017 --> 00:14:10.570\nthis one is going to be true, okay,\nso that's all this is going to do.\n\n246\n00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:14.570\nNow we're gonna do is put it all together,\n\n247\n00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:19.020\nokay, [LAUGH] it's something\nlike put it all together,\n\n248\n00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:23.450\nbake it, and round it, put it in the oven,\nI don't know why that is just true\n\n249\n00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:27.265\nduring that particular nursery rant.\n&gt;&gt; So I can't even remember all of it but\n\n250\n00:14:27.265 --> 00:14:30.561\nI know what you're talking about,\nI was like, where did she get, ahh.\n\n251\n00:14:30.561 --> 00:14:32.722\n&gt;&gt; Right, and mark it with a b,\n\n252\n00:14:32.722 --> 00:14:36.053\nand put it in the, wow, okay, I'm sorry,\n\n253\n00:14:36.053 --> 00:14:39.134\nmy mind is went [SOUND] childhood memory.\n\n254\n00:14:39.134 --> 00:14:40.235\n&gt;&gt; Anyway.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n255\n00:14:40.235 --> 00:14:42.785\n&gt;&gt; So I can sure she's talking about ifs\n\n256\n00:14:42.785 --> 00:14:45.495\ncuz I can't remember that.\n&gt;&gt; I know it's all right,\n\n257\n00:14:45.495 --> 00:14:51.285\nI completely derailed us but\nanyways, let's keep on going and\n\n258\n00:14:51.285 --> 00:14:53.915\nwe will move on to the if statement.\n\n259\n00:14:53.915 --> 00:14:58.236\nFor us we're gonna do this,we're\ngoing to open this cell up,\n\n260\n00:14:58.236 --> 00:15:03.712\nmeaning I'm going to edit directly into,\nI'm gonna copy the text out of this.\n\n261\n00:15:03.712 --> 00:15:08.564\nNot copying the cell because I\nwant to get this part to be able\n\n262\n00:15:08.564 --> 00:15:13.335\nto nest this in my if statement\ncuz this is my logical test.\n\n263\n00:15:13.335 --> 00:15:18.255\nThis is the test that I need to have\nin the if statement of whether they get\n\n264\n00:15:18.255 --> 00:15:20.797\na treat or they don't get a treat, so\n\n265\n00:15:20.797 --> 00:15:25.590\nthat's why you wanna copy\nthe formula text, not the cell.\n\n266\n00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:29.370\nThen I'm gonna hit escape to get out\nof it, double click into the cell and\n\n267\n00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:32.165\nthen paste so\nthat way the references don't change,\n\n268\n00:15:32.165 --> 00:15:35.410\ncuz otherwise when you copy the cell\nit does change the references.\n\n269\n00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:38.222\nPut all of this is my logical test, so,\n\n270\n00:15:38.222 --> 00:15:41.891\nknowing a little bit about\nhow if statements work,\n\n271\n00:15:41.891 --> 00:15:47.542\nI know that I'm going to type in the\nfunction name, and then open the bracket.\n\n272\n00:15:47.542 --> 00:15:50.849\nWe can go ahead and capitalize it, it will\ncapitalize it automatically for us but\n\n273\n00:15:50.849 --> 00:15:52.124\nI just want you to see it there.\n\n274\n00:15:52.124 --> 00:15:55.472\nSo, if, open the parenthesis,\n\n275\n00:15:55.472 --> 00:16:00.741\nhere is my logical test,\nkeep that in parenthesis.\n\n276\n00:16:00.741 --> 00:16:06.690\nAfter the one closing parenthesis of\nthe test, we're gonna put a comma.\n\n277\n00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:09.990\nThen if it is true and\nsee it's highlighting, if it is true,\n\n278\n00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:16.500\nwe're going to say you get a treat and\nthen a comma, and then open the quote.\n\n279\n00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:20.550\nAnd if not, you say no, you are a bad cat.\n\n280\n00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:24.120\nWhoa hello, that is not we wanna say,\nwe wanna say BAD CAT,\n\n281\n00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.730\nI think I hit the Space bar or something.\n\n282\n00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:27.890\nSo I just double checked.\n\n283\n00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:28.660\nYes, that's what I've got.\n\n284\n00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:30.060\nLet's close that parenthesis.\n\n285\n00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:36.230\nOkay, just making sure that my syntax\nis correct and let's move back over so\n\n286\n00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:37.630\nyou can see that.\n\n287\n00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:43.320\nThere you go, we have evaluated\nthat Sasha gets a treat, and\n\n288\n00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:48.520\nso does, trying to get the, there we go,\nand so does Pumpkin and Bishop.\n\n289\n00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:52.530\nPoema and Fuego do not and\nthat is our argument.\n\n290\n00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:57.450\nSo we're putting two of our conditions and\nwith an and operator.\n\n291\n00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:01.830\nNot an operator,\na function with an if statement.\n\n292\n00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:07.390\nSee it gets slightly circular when you\ntry to talk out a little bit more but\n\n293\n00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:08.640\nthat's what we're going to do.\n\n294\n00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:10.900\nThat's an AND.\n\n295\n00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.950\nWhat about the OR?\n\n296\n00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:16.340\nSo we're gonna do this as well.\n\n297\n00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:21.510\nSo we're going to take this,\nwe're going to copy this.\n\n298\n00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:25.500\nWe're going to escape,\ncomeback to OR, double-click and\n\n299\n00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:26.610\nthen we're going to paste.\n\n300\n00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:29.300\nBecause what's the other thing I\nneed to change out there Justin,\n\n301\n00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.780\nI'm gonna give you a test.\n&gt;&gt; Wait,\n\n302\n00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:32.915\nwe're just need to change OR.\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n303\n00:17:32.915 --> 00:17:34.630\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we need to change the AND to the OR\n\n304\n00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:39.140\nand, for some reason, when I think of this\nfunction, I would almost think of AND\n\n305\n00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.560\nis saying all,\n\n306\n00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:45.580\nlike all of these things have to be true.\n&gt;&gt; And then the or could be in it.\n\n307\n00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:46.600\nAll or in it.\n\n308\n00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.630\nSo, if you think of it,\nthat's not what they're called, but\n\n309\n00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:53.670\nif you think of it that way, then it might\nhelp with the reason, especially if you\n\n310\n00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:56.200\nhave a lot of test conditions.\n&gt;&gt; Again,\n\n311\n00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:01.000\nanother great way to just kind of\nremember how to approach these functions.\n\n312\n00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.200\nBecause these are pretty decent\nexamples and it sounds as like,\n\n313\n00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:11.700\nI feel like it's enough to keep your\nbrain not going too crazy on the logic.\n\n314\n00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:17.700\nSo, we can look at the OR of what is true\nand what is false but, neither right?\n\n315\n00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:22.190\nNeither would be no, so that would\nbe false, and, then we're gonna take\n\n316\n00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:27.140\nthe same thing just like we did with\nthe AND, we're going to, whoops.\n\n317\n00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:28.680\nSorry, I gotta hit the escape key.\n\n318\n00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:29.940\nWe gotta double click,\n\n319\n00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:34.370\nput it in there, wrap all of this up and\nI'm just gonna move over for you.\n\n320\n00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:37.695\nGonna wrap all of this up into an IF.\n\n321\n00:18:37.695 --> 00:18:42.205\nThis is our test from back over here,\ncomma.\n\n322\n00:18:42.205 --> 00:18:45.455\nThen we type in treat, not tera.\n\n323\n00:18:45.455 --> 00:18:47.515\nWe're going to do a treat and\n\n324\n00:18:47.515 --> 00:18:52.867\nthen well maybe a little Nice,\nwe're just gonna say no.\n\n325\n00:18:52.867 --> 00:18:54.643\nWe won't key.\n\n326\n00:18:54.643 --> 00:19:00.277\nSo we'll take that, syntax correct,\nperfect, and we put it on down.\n\n327\n00:19:00.277 --> 00:19:05.327\nSo you can see this time\nthat Pulma does get a treat,\n\n328\n00:19:05.327 --> 00:19:09.920\nbecause she's a very nice cat so\nshe didn't swipe at me at all.\n\n329\n00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.360\nSo it's just because\nshe's a very quiet cat.\n\n330\n00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:17.200\nSo she didn't meow enough but she was\nwaiting patiently, so you get a treat.\n\n331\n00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:24.055\nBefore I go, no, he's, if all every\ntime I walk the path, it doesn't matter\n\n332\n00:19:24.055 --> 00:19:27.345\nwhere he's sitting, I just kinda like,\nI'm just kinda grab that paw!\n\n333\n00:19:27.345 --> 00:19:28.185\nI'm like what?\n\n334\n00:19:28.185 --> 00:19:32.305\nI just fed you, he's a [UNKNOWN.\n\n335\n00:19:32.305 --> 00:19:35.595\nAnyway, so\nthat's what we have with our statements.\n\n336\n00:19:35.595 --> 00:19:42.075\nNow everything that I have been talking\nabout has been comparing numbers, correct?\n\n337\n00:19:42.075 --> 00:19:47.590\nI wanted to show you that you can do\nthis with text and I already have it.\n\n338\n00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:52.180\nSo just cuz, it might be that you're\ncomparing, and looking at data, that is,\n\n339\n00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:53.780\nlike, okay, well, what's in here?\n\n340\n00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:56.100\nCheese, pizza, cat, dog, or cheese, pizza.\n\n341\n00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.250\nWell, these are the things\nthat I'm looking for.\n\n342\n00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:02.120\nCheese, or pizza and\nI want to yield one of the others.\n\n343\n00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:07.130\nNow, this is where AND is probably\nnot gonna work with text string.\n\n344\n00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:09.250\nSo let me just show you\nwhat it says right here.\n\n345\n00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:14.310\nWe're saying and does A5 equal A1, okay.\n\n346\n00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:21.030\nCheese, right?, but,\nit also needs to equal B2,\n\n347\n00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:24.180\nwhich is a less actually,\nI actually got those in a wrong reference.\n\n348\n00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:28.600\nSo, why don't we go ahead and\njust change those to A1, sorry guys.\n\n349\n00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:33.180\nLet's go with A, it's still not gonna\nwork [LAUGH] And, we'll go to A.\n\n350\n00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:34.410\nThere we go, perfect.\n\n351\n00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:38.185\nNow we'll copy it down,\nwe'll have it absolute.\n\n352\n00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:42.210\nRestaurant, yeah I'm thinking\nfood too much but, you see,\n\n353\n00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:43.960\nit's always going to be\nfalse isn't it Justin?\n\n354\n00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:45.880\nBecause even with cheese and pizza,\n\n355\n00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.780\nit doesn't work, does it?\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n356\n00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:51.025\nthat's because we're doing\nthis quality comparison.\n\n357\n00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:54.940\nI'm sure we could get a little\ncrazy with other comparisons,\n\n358\n00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:56.670\nlike deeply nested things.\n\n359\n00:20:56.670 --> 00:21:04.450\nBut strict equality, cheese is not cheese\nand pizza, it's not the same, right.\n\n360\n00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:09.840\nThat's like saying the number five can\nbe the number five, or the number seven.\n\n361\n00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.510\nIt just doesn't make sense.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's where the OR\n\n362\n00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:16.760\nis, no it's both, and what he said,\n\n363\n00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:20.730\ndoes it have the cheese inside.\n\n364\n00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:26.880\nYou can nest finds and\nall sorts of other test and\n\n365\n00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.950\ncomparisons within using other functions,\nbut by itself, that's not gonna work, but\n\n366\n00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:34.580\nwith text, you could do something,\nlike an OR.\n\n367\n00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:37.170\nThis is where it would actually make\na little bit more sense and this one,\n\n368\n00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.780\nI did actually have the reference correct.\n\n369\n00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:46.150\nIt can be cheese, or pizza, and\nnotice, I also put an extra one.\n\n370\n00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:51.610\nIt's saying, comparing and looking at\ncheese or A5, and doesn't equal CAT,\n\n371\n00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:56.630\nand since did one equal one of the any,\nright?\n\n372\n00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:57.790\nIt's going to yield TRUE.\n\n373\n00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:01.180\nSame with pizza and cat,\nbecause it was another value in there.\n\n374\n00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:04.830\nDog, cheese pizza, that's going\nto go ahead and go with false.\n\n375\n00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:11.839\nSo working with text totally is\navailable in AND and OR statements.\n\n376\n00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:14.440\nIt just goes like you're saying.\n\n377\n00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:15.950\nIt's straight equality.\n\n378\n00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:19.900\nSo you probably wanna only go with OR\nand not the AND\n\n379\n00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:23.560\nfunction when you're talking about text.\n&gt;&gt; Now, Vaughn, it's kind\n\n380\n00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.600\nof interesting cuz this entire episode\nwe've been talking about comparisons.\n\n381\n00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:30.540\nWhich you should, but\nI'm always looking to break things.\n\n382\n00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:34.660\nMaybe I could hurry or I forget.\n\n383\n00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:38.220\nWhat happens if I don't have comparisons,\nlike if I have just,\n\n384\n00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:43.060\nI have text inside of an AND or an OR?\n&gt;&gt; You're always\n\n385\n00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:48.058\ngood with that like hey Von what if we did\nthis and I'm like hmm, let's find out!\n\n386\n00:22:48.058 --> 00:22:50.880\n[LAUGH] All right,\nthat's a great question and\n\n387\n00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.180\nit's a really good thing\nto talk about here.\n\n388\n00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:59.040\nWhen we're doing AND and ORs,\nyes you are going to need to do a test.\n\n389\n00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:05.960\nI need to test this information or this\nlogical function to see what's going on.\n\n390\n00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:12.580\nSo we are you, let me go with AND,\nso you're saying if I just said cat.\n\n391\n00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:16.258\nSo cat is a string so\nwould have to put it in quotes, right?\n\n392\n00:23:16.258 --> 00:23:19.800\nSo you're saying cat or dog.\n\n393\n00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:23.860\nNow that's not the same as saying equals,\nis this equal to this?\n\n394\n00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:25.730\nBecause that is what\nyou're trying to find out,\n\n395\n00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:29.770\nyou're just saying cat dog, declaration.\n\n396\n00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:34.800\nNo, it doesn't understand that.\n\n397\n00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.910\nIt's saying I don't know\nwhat I'm looking at.\n\n398\n00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:38.170\nI don't have any test.\n\n399\n00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:42.140\nSo, no even more no.\n\n400\n00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:47.297\nIt's just a value of saying and you get a\nlittle thing it's like no, it's an error.\n\n401\n00:23:47.297 --> 00:23:52.070\nSorry, we can't help you there,\nso it's gonna break in that sense\n\n402\n00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:56.353\nwhen you're talking about just\nstraight text, all right.\n\n403\n00:23:56.353 --> 00:24:00.134\nLet's switch over to Justin,\nhe's just going over.\n\n404\n00:24:00.134 --> 00:24:00.684\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n405\n00:24:00.684 --> 00:24:02.427\nI got a follow up question.\n&gt;&gt; Uh-oh,\n\n406\n00:24:02.427 --> 00:24:05.570\nI'm a little scared [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; I get burned about this\n\n407\n00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:09.690\nevery once in a while in some\nof my kind of experiences.\n\n408\n00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:11.600\nThe text doesn't work, that's cool.\n\n409\n00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:14.974\nThat's actually a good thing I argue,\ncuz I can't accidentally\n\n410\n00:24:14.974 --> 00:24:17.604\nmess up and get weird values\n&gt;&gt; What if you change those to\n\n411\n00:24:17.604 --> 00:24:18.990\nnumbers?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n412\n00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:22.246\n&gt;&gt; Like the number 1 and the number 5?\n\n413\n00:24:22.246 --> 00:24:23.970\nI don't know.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n414\n00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:25.010\nlet's go to number 1 and number 5.\n\n415\n00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:29.740\nNow, let's look it..\n\n416\n00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:32.970\nRemember what AND as a function does.\n\n417\n00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:37.246\nThe only thing it will do is it\nwill either do a false or a true.\n\n418\n00:24:37.246 --> 00:24:41.100\nWith our test, it's saying here is\nlogical test 1, here is logical test 2.\n\n419\n00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:42.690\nAnd it's like 1 in 5.\n\n420\n00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:44.298\nThat's a declaration.\n\n421\n00:24:44.298 --> 00:24:47.284\nWhat's going on?.\n\n422\n00:24:47.284 --> 00:24:48.540\nI do know what's going on.\n\n423\n00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:51.872\nBut Justin, do you want to take this?\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n424\n00:24:51.872 --> 00:24:54.690\nbefore I make any assertions,\nlet's try one other thing.\n\n425\n00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:57.841\nLet's change that 1 to a 0.\n&gt;&gt; Remember,\n\n426\n00:24:57.841 --> 00:25:01.090\nit has to be both.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, okay.\n\n427\n00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:01.960\n&gt;&gt; False.\n\n428\n00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:05.725\n&gt;&gt; What if we changed that 0 back to a 5,\n\n429\n00:25:05.725 --> 00:25:09.523\nbut changed the number 1 to a 0?\n&gt;&gt; Like that?\n\n430\n00:25:09.523 --> 00:25:10.874\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n431\n00:25:10.874 --> 00:25:11.374\n&gt;&gt; False.\n\n432\n00:25:11.374 --> 00:25:11.918\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n433\n00:25:11.918 --> 00:25:13.127\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n434\n00:25:13.127 --> 00:25:15.714\n&gt;&gt; I see what's going on here.\n\n435\n00:25:15.714 --> 00:25:18.020\nI think I see what's going on.\n\n436\n00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:23.555\nSo with AND, a number will actually\nevaluate to a true or a false.\n\n437\n00:25:23.555 --> 00:25:29.120\n0 appears to be false, and\nthen everything else is true.\n\n438\n00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.372\nI say that, wonder if we try a negative.\n\n439\n00:25:31.372 --> 00:25:35.466\nWhat about a negative 5 and a negative 3?\n\n440\n00:25:35.466 --> 00:25:38.890\n&gt;&gt; Negative 5, negative 3.\n\n441\n00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:43.560\nOkay, so anything except 0 is true.\n\n442\n00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:46.180\n0 is false so in AND,\nif there's a 0 in there.\n\n443\n00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:49.470\nBut this is important because\nif you forget a test, right?\n\n444\n00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:53.870\nIf you forget a comparison, you may get\nactually get a true or false result.\n\n445\n00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:56.523\nBut all you said is 7 and 4, all right.\n\n446\n00:25:56.523 --> 00:25:58.220\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And why is that?\n\n447\n00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:02.380\nIf you're out there going,\nwhy is it doing true?\n\n448\n00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:06.777\nWell, the thing is true, false,\n\n449\n00:26:06.777 --> 00:26:11.286\non, off, yes, no, 1, 0.\n\n450\n00:26:11.286 --> 00:26:15.632\nThe thing is the way computers talk.\n\n451\n00:26:15.632 --> 00:26:20.425\n1 is yes, it's on.\n\n452\n00:26:20.425 --> 00:26:22.920\n0 is no, it's off.\n\n453\n00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:28.910\nYou can think of it as 1 is true,\n0 is false.\n\n454\n00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:34.158\nSo maybe it can explain if you're going,\nso now all these different ways\n\n455\n00:26:34.158 --> 00:26:39.930\nof us saying 0 and 5, or 5 and 1, or what\ndid we say, negative 5 and negative 3.\n\n456\n00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:41.870\nWhy is that true?\n\n457\n00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:45.730\nIt's not 0, but it's less.\n\n458\n00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:46.411\nIt gets a little weird.\n\n459\n00:26:46.411 --> 00:26:50.103\nBut before we get too far\ndown the rabbit hole,\n\n460\n00:26:50.103 --> 00:26:53.802\nbecause I can see your\nbrain going like [SOUND].\n\n461\n00:26:53.802 --> 00:26:58.685\nYou just have to simplify it down\ninto computer talk in ons and\n\n462\n00:26:58.685 --> 00:27:02.750\noff, ones and zeros.\n&gt;&gt; True and false, yes and no.\n\n463\n00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:04.880\nSo it can, like you said,\n\n464\n00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:10.020\nit can yield some weird results if\nyou're using numbers as declarations and\n\n465\n00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:13.111\nnot any type of comparisons.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n466\n00:27:13.111 --> 00:27:16.950\nI've been in some of the other episodes.\n\n467\n00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:19.160\nThis actually behaves,\nif I remember correctly,\n\n468\n00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:23.510\na little bit differently than some other\ntimes where we may have true or false,\n\n469\n00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:27.500\nwhere everything else\nis false except true.\n\n470\n00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:30.230\nThere was one thing where it\nwas like the opposite of that.\n\n471\n00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:32.810\nSo just you gotta be careful here.\n\n472\n00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:35.504\nWhat happens if we change this to an or?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm,\n\n473\n00:27:35.504 --> 00:27:37.790\nso we did OR.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n474\n00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:39.070\n&gt;&gt; So the negatives.\n\n475\n00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:42.089\n&gt;&gt; What if we make one of them 0?\n\n476\n00:27:42.089 --> 00:27:45.661\n&gt;&gt; First you said, well, with the OR, see,\n\n477\n00:27:45.661 --> 00:27:48.730\nI had to stop myself,\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n478\n00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:54.659\nnow if they're both 0, Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Wow,\n\n479\n00:27:54.659 --> 00:27:57.978\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, if you had a giant\n\n480\n00:27:57.978 --> 00:28:03.840\nset of interdependent sheets and\nyou accidentally fed numbers into one.\n\n481\n00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:08.877\nAnd it was like how much you're in debt or\nsomething, [SOUND] and it cascades, this\n\n482\n00:28:08.877 --> 00:28:12.568\ncould be an actual catastrophic error.\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and\n\n483\n00:28:12.568 --> 00:28:17.500\nexactly what you just said because\nI would never type in 1 or 0.\n\n484\n00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:22.470\nYou could type in 52.65\nbecause that's your debt, or\n\n485\n00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:26.080\nthat's a cell reference\nthat you didn't realize,\n\n486\n00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:30.135\nthat wasn't a comparison,\nit wasn't a test.\n\n487\n00:28:30.135 --> 00:28:32.385\nYeah, that could be huge.\n\n488\n00:28:32.385 --> 00:28:36.305\nSo that's where it seems like,\nyeah, this isn't too bad.\n\n489\n00:28:36.305 --> 00:28:40.335\nBe careful of these things and\nwhat you're actually selecting in,\n\n490\n00:28:40.335 --> 00:28:42.485\nwhat your data is actually saying,\n\n491\n00:28:42.485 --> 00:28:46.125\nwhat's in these cells that you're\ntrying to make these comparisons?\n\n492\n00:28:46.125 --> 00:28:51.730\nBecause, yeah, these are things that you\nprobably would never think would happen.\n\n493\n00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:55.160\nAt least now you know it could.\n\n494\n00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:59.810\nAnd you can be on the alert and\nknow when you get into this this,\n\n495\n00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:04.820\nit could yield some unexpected\nresults if you're just throwing in\n\n496\n00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:10.117\nnumbers in there and not actually\nsaying is 52 greater than 100?\n\n497\n00:29:10.117 --> 00:29:12.126\nThat's a test.\n\n498\n00:29:12.126 --> 00:29:17.539\nAs long as you're comparing something,\nyour logical functions should\n\n499\n00:29:17.539 --> 00:29:22.521\nwork most of the time but\nof course you have to remember the syntax.\n\n500\n00:29:22.521 --> 00:29:25.084\nThere are so many variables, but yes,\n\n501\n00:29:25.084 --> 00:29:29.910\nI hope that clarifies a little bit\nabout these two functions, AND and OR.\n\n502\n00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:31.950\nYou're gonna see them a lot.\n\n503\n00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:35.333\nThey're logical functions,\nthe IFs, the ANDs, the ORs and\n\n504\n00:29:35.333 --> 00:29:39.580\nthen you get into the whole other\nworld of like LOOKUPs and everything.\n\n505\n00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:41.680\nThese are very common functions.\n\n506\n00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:45.739\nYou just have to look at it and\nreally remember and\n\n507\n00:29:45.739 --> 00:29:51.700\nunderstand what is AND, what is OR,\nAND, ANY, OR, EITHER, right?\n\n508\n00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.503\nSo what did you say?\n&gt;&gt; AND is ALL.\n\n509\n00:29:53.503 --> 00:29:54.189\n&gt;&gt; AND is ALL.\n\n510\n00:29:54.189 --> 00:29:54.884\n&gt;&gt; And ALL is ANY.\n\n511\n00:29:54.884 --> 00:29:57.010\nSo if any of them are true, AND and OR,\n\n512\n00:29:57.010 --> 00:29:59.910\nthen it's true.\n&gt;&gt; See, I'm already lost in them.\n\n513\n00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:02.400\n&gt;&gt; All of them are true in an AND,\n\n514\n00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.120\nis an AND untrue.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n515\n00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:08.290\n&gt;&gt; So you still be very careful.\n\n516\n00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:09.110\nI still get them mixed up.\n\n517\n00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:10.820\nI'm like, yeah, wait a minute.\n\n518\n00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:13.800\nHold on, that one's not true and\nthat one's broken.\n\n519\n00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:17.310\nSo you can get a little twisted\nwith logic, so don't worry.\n\n520\n00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:22.450\nNow Vonne, before we get out of here, any\nfinal parting words of wisdom from you?\n\n521\n00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:23.938\n&gt;&gt; I don't think so.\n\n522\n00:30:23.938 --> 00:30:24.737\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n523\n00:30:24.737 --> 00:30:27.050\n&gt;&gt; Wow, it's like and we're done.\n\n524\n00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:28.300\nYes, just be careful.\n\n525\n00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:29.600\nWell, all right, well, there you have it.\n\n526\n00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:30.690\nDefinitely be careful but\n\n527\n00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:35.630\nthese can be great decision-makers when\nyou're trying to set up a complex logic.\n\n528\n00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:37.700\nRemember, you have up to 255 of them.\n\n529\n00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:40.620\nAnd if need be,\nyou can probably create two columns and\n\n530\n00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:43.890\nadd those two things\ntogether to further expand.\n\n531\n00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:46.910\nDon't forget, though, there's a couple\nof edge cases you gotta watch out for.\n\n532\n00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:49.100\nAnd while speaking of watch out,\nyou should definitely come on and\n\n533\n00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:51.110\nwatch some more Excel functions.\n\n534\n00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:53.140\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n535\n00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:55.940\nSo signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n536\n00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:56.620\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n537\n00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:58.225\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n538\n00:30:58.225 --> 00:31:02.721\n[SOUND]\n\n",

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.534 --> 00:00:20.049\nI'm your host, Vonne Smith, and\nwe are coming back at you with more of our\n\n4\n00:00:20.049 --> 00:00:24.580\nExcel Functions series, and in this\nepisode, we're gonna be talking about NOT.\n\n5\n00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.270\nAnd here to not get us confused is Mr.\nJustin Dennison, how are you today?\n\n6\n00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.610\n&gt;&gt; I'm not bad Vonne, I'm not bad.\n\n7\n00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.520\nAnd no, you don't need to adjust\nyour seat, I'm not Vonne Smith, and\n\n8\n00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.580\nthat's not Justin Dennison, but you are on\nOfficePro and yeah, this is one of those\n\n9\n00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:45.080\nthings where since I've built into a logic\nbefore, I decided to grab the helm.\n\n10\n00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.270\nI actually shoved Vonne out of the way and\nwas like, move, I got this.\n\n11\n00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.810\nRight, Vonne?\n\n12\n00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:54.372\n&gt;&gt; And I said, go for it because\n[LAUGH] I will tell you all right now,\n\n13\n00:00:54.372 --> 00:00:57.370\nthis one, this is a doozy, okay?\n\n14\n00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.180\nThis is a logical function\nthat we're gonna talk about.\n\n15\n00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.650\nThe NOT function.\n\n16\n00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:11.620\nAnd this reminds me of opposite day in\nschool of like, not here, not in it.\n\n17\n00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.750\nIt is hard, so put your helmets on,\n\n18\n00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.150\nwe're gonna strap on in and I did bring\nin Mr. Justin Dennison to help us because\n\n19\n00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.310\nyou've explained this quite a lot,\nin a way that,\n\n20\n00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.240\nI thought was probably the easiest way\nto go by, because we, I'll tell you,\n\n21\n00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.740\nwe've been off camera, circling of\nhow are we going to approach this,\n\n22\n00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.660\nand so you know what,\nwe just decide to flip.\n\n23\n00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.360\n&gt;&gt; Would have split the script so\nto speak, and yeah,\n\n24\n00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.910\nI think the most difficult thing is you\nbrought up some childhood kinda thing,\n\n25\n00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.530\nand language directly influences\nhow we perceive things,\n\n26\n00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.050\nhow we reason about things,\nbecause our language can be ambiguous,\n\n27\n00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.190\nor we're told a bunch of rules,\ndon't use a double negatives.\n\n28\n00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.790\nExcept when you need double\nemphasis on the negative part, but\n\n29\n00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.780\nit's really bad, right?\n\n30\n00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.470\nI don't not like this.\n\n31\n00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.770\nWait a minute.\n\n32\n00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.000\nIf I don't not like it,\nthat means that I do like it, right?\n\n33\n00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.520\nBut those are simple things.\n\n34\n00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.170\nIf you start expanding that out,\nit's a compound sentence.\n\n35\n00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.819\nIt becomes more difficult to\nreason about and it's funny.\n\n36\n00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.090\nIt's funny in the sense of, we laugh and\ngiggle how complex it is, but\n\n37\n00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.930\nit ends up possibly leading to errors.\n\n38\n00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.200\nI'm gonna come back to this one\npoint throughout this episode.\n\n39\n00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:36.592\nWhen you can trace things in a positive\nmanner, eliminate the not, if possible.\n\n40\n00:02:36.592 --> 00:02:39.992\nNow, it may require you either\nre-running the sentences or\n\n41\n00:02:39.992 --> 00:02:44.056\nrethinking about the problem, but\nit's probably in your best interest\n\n42\n00:02:44.056 --> 00:02:46.721\nbecause adding a not\nsometimes get you kind of,\n\n43\n00:02:46.721 --> 00:02:51.210\nyou end up going the opposite direction\nthat you meant to and it gets weird.\n\n44\n00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.515\n&gt;&gt; This reminds me of your DevProTV\nshow where you talk about these things,\n\n45\n00:02:55.515 --> 00:02:59.090\nwhat I know, what do I need to know,\nand sometimes,\n\n46\n00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.700\nchange the problem, turn around to\nwhere I could kind of flip it back.\n\n47\n00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.840\nSo, this is a mantra of yours that's\nbeen through all of your stuff [LAUGH]\n\n48\n00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.080\n&gt;&gt; Well I try my best,\n\n49\n00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.420\nit's worked well for me and\nhopefully, it'll work well for you.\n\n50\n00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.240\nAnd just to illustrate how\ndifficult adding a not can be,\n\n51\n00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.160\nwell we have an example here for,\ntake a look at the screen.\n\n52\n00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.360\nAnd this is not my computer, so\nif I scroll in that direction,\n\n53\n00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.720\njust bear with me and if I go on\nscreensaver, just bear with me as well.\n\n54\n00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.220\nSo Vonne, we're gonna flip the script and\nask you a few questions, except,\n\n55\n00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.170\nI'm gonna add kind of the negation.\n\n56\n00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.538\nDo you not like cheese?\n\n57\n00:03:41.251 --> 00:03:42.130\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n58\n00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.428\n&gt;&gt; So you do not.\n\n59\n00:03:43.428 --> 00:03:44.115\n&gt;&gt; Wait, yes.\n\n60\n00:03:44.115 --> 00:03:46.680\n[LAUGH] Already confused.\n\n61\n00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.280\n&gt;&gt; So if you-\n&gt;&gt; Do not like cheese.\n\n62\n00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.160\nNo, I like cheese.\n\n63\n00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.540\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nwe're gonna put a no here.\n\n64\n00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.044\nAll right, and then,\ndo you not like onions?\n\n65\n00:03:57.044 --> 00:04:00.892\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So, do you not like,\n\n66\n00:04:00.892 --> 00:04:03.530\nokay, but I do like.\n\n67\n00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.003\nSo, wait a minute, no,\n\n68\n00:04:05.003 --> 00:04:08.670\nyou're automatically adding\nan additional nogation.\n\n69\n00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.250\nNogation is essentially\nflipping it around, right?\n\n70\n00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.760\nAnd then gating the not by answering no,\nand\n\n71\n00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.220\nit's already,\nI could continue to ask this.\n\n72\n00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.540\nIt's already kind of getting confusing\nbecause we go, wait a minute,\n\n73\n00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.310\ntypically we would not answer those\nquestions with just a simple yes or no.\n\n74\n00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.510\nDo you not like onions?\n\n75\n00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.100\nNo, I do like onions.\n\n76\n00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.410\nNotice how when I put the clarification,\nthe answer becomes more definitive,\n\n77\n00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.150\nit actually becomes a little\neasier to reason about.\n\n78\n00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.210\nIt's almost an after thought, the no or\n\n79\n00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.090\nthe yes part of the beginning\nof the sentence.\n\n80\n00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.320\nDo you not like cheese?\n\n81\n00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.050\nNo, I like cheese.\n\n82\n00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.190\nWell, see the no's there.\n\n83\n00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.330\nDo you not like mushrooms?\n\n84\n00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.190\nNo, I like mushrooms.\n\n85\n00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.770\nDo you not like onions?\n\n86\n00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:53.630\nYes, I don't like onions.\n\n87\n00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.980\nSo that little added extra\ncan provide clarity and\n\n88\n00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.910\nthat's typically how we\nanswer those questions.\n\n89\n00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.580\nNow, these are already kinda twisted,\nright?\n\n90\n00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.320\nBut if we come down here and\nif we start adding and,\n\n91\n00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.020\ndo you not like cheese and onions?\n\n92\n00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.570\nWait a minute,\ndo I not like cheese and onion?\n\n93\n00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.360\nSo what we're gonna do is,\nin the meantime,\n\n94\n00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.860\nwe're gonna leave this adding\nadditional logic operators\n\n95\n00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.540\ncan make things a little more difficult\nthan they need to be upfront.\n\n96\n00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.250\nSo we're not gonna do that, all right?\n\n97\n00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.610\nSo let's go ahead and, one final review.\n\n98\n00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.040\nWe're gonna hop over here and this is\na review from our previous episode,\n\n99\n00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.490\nour and, or episode where we\nhave a true or false, right?\n\n100\n00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:50.040\nAnd both True and True, that means\nthat I would have a true statement.\n\n101\n00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.230\nTrue or True would have a true statement.\n\n102\n00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:58.860\nAnd Vonne, I'm gonna actually change this\nup a little bit and say And, all right?\n\n103\n00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.990\nAnd Or, just so\nwe can get a quick overview here.\n\n104\n00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.920\nSo I'm gonna say =And, and click.\n\n105\n00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.218\nAnd, I forgot, you got to add the.\n\n106\n00:06:09.218 --> 00:06:12.940\nYou know, Vonne, you got me every time.\n\n107\n00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.170\nThere we go.\n\n108\n00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:15.550\nSo boom.\n\n109\n00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.950\nI'm gong to put an =Or here.\n\n110\n00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.860\nSo, true and comma, true.\n\n111\n00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.880\nAnd really, I guess I could add some\nother things there, but that's all right.\n\n112\n00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:28.670\nWe'll go with it.\n\n113\n00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:32.760\nSo, and and and or true and true\n&gt;&gt; We have to drag it\n\n114\n00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.720\ndown if it's not next to each other.\n\n115\n00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.262\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I forgot about that.\n\n116\n00:06:35.262 --> 00:06:35.910\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n117\n00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.760\n&gt;&gt; See, that's why you're here Vonne,\n\n118\n00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.290\nit's those small little\ntricks that I forget about.\n\n119\n00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:46.900\n&gt;&gt; So true,\nwhen do I have a false with an int?\n\n120\n00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.610\nIf any of them are false,\nnotice here, right?\n\n121\n00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.790\nDoesn't me out enough, right?\n\n122\n00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.375\nOr excuse me, now is too much, right?\n\n123\n00:06:56.375 --> 00:06:58.315\nSwipes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you right.\n\n124\n00:06:58.315 --> 00:07:00.845\n&gt;&gt; I look at that 3 and\nI was like no, that's not right.\n\n125\n00:07:00.845 --> 00:07:01.927\n&gt;&gt; Keep going.\n\n126\n00:07:01.927 --> 00:07:03.765\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] False said false, or\n\n127\n00:07:03.765 --> 00:07:05.855\nfalse said true is false.\n\n128\n00:07:05.855 --> 00:07:10.155\nFalse and false is false, but true and\ntrue, true and true, true and true.\n\n129\n00:07:10.155 --> 00:07:13.345\nSo only when you're both or\nall of them are true.\n\n130\n00:07:13.345 --> 00:07:14.920\nThese are the only two conditions.\n\n131\n00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.480\nSo it could get a little iffy if\nyou had a bunch of other ones.\n\n132\n00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.000\nWe have two, and then with or,\nif any of them are true then it's true.\n\n133\n00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.660\nThe only time we encounter a false is\nif we have both falses, all right?\n\n134\n00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.730\nNow, keep that in mind\nbecause now you're comparing\n\n135\n00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:37.680\nthese two things and\nit seems fairly straightforward.\n\n136\n00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:43.910\nBut if we come back and we think,\nwell how does not kind of play into this?\n\n137\n00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:48.080\nOkay, so let's think about this.\n\n138\n00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.714\nStatus is good if you have no timeouts.\n\n139\n00:07:50.714 --> 00:07:52.190\nNow timeouts in this context,\n\n140\n00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.042\nwe were talking about I was like,\nlike sports timeouts?\n\n141\n00:07:55.042 --> 00:07:58.388\nNo, we're saying we're putting the cats\nin timeout because They've been\n\n142\n00:07:58.388 --> 00:07:59.232\nnaughty, right?\n\n143\n00:07:59.232 --> 00:08:04.050\n&gt;&gt; Yes, they've been a bad kitty and\nyou're like, okay, you need a time out.\n\n144\n00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:07.670\nSo if you've been in time out,\nkind of like my children, right, okay?\n\n145\n00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:09.710\nYou've got a time out, then you are bad.\n\n146\n00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:11.250\nSee, I'm already flipping it.\n\n147\n00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:17.058\nOkay, so your status is good if\nyou have no time outs statement.\n\n148\n00:08:17.058 --> 00:08:18.103\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n149\n00:08:18.103 --> 00:08:20.573\n&gt;&gt; And then all we've done here,\n\n150\n00:08:20.573 --> 00:08:23.900\nit's more or less a simple binary logic.\n\n151\n00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:27.040\nSasha, yes, you've had timeouts.\n\n152\n00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.605\nPumpkin, yes, you've had timeouts.\n\n153\n00:08:28.605 --> 00:08:30.784\nPuma, no, you don't have any timeouts.\n\n154\n00:08:30.784 --> 00:08:35.703\nSo if we look here, and Bishop no, and\nFuego, I mean, with a name like Fuego,\n\n155\n00:08:35.703 --> 00:08:39.282\nfire, I'm sure there's time\nouts always in there, but\n\n156\n00:08:39.282 --> 00:08:41.620\nmaybe I'm projecting a little bit.\n\n157\n00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.994\nBut our status test here.\n\n158\n00:08:43.994 --> 00:08:49.007\nWell, this is false, right, you had a bad\n\n159\n00:08:49.007 --> 00:08:54.451\nstatus because you've had time outs, okay?\n\n160\n00:08:54.451 --> 00:09:00.825\nNow, if you come here and you look, wait\na minute, let me make sure I said that,\n\n161\n00:09:00.825 --> 00:09:05.500\nif you have time outs,\ntrue is good, false is bad, okay?\n\n162\n00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.090\nGot a little twisted there.\n\n163\n00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:10.450\nNow, if we come here and\nlook, notice this,\n\n164\n00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:13.500\nthat's a weird looking character, right?\n\n165\n00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:19.490\nTypically you see an equal sign or a less\nthan, or a greater than, greater than or\n\n166\n00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:24.220\nequal to, this is not equal to, okay?\n\n167\n00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:28.870\nSo is B7 not equal to yes?\n\n168\n00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:30.880\nWell, now we're back\nto that flipped logic.\n\n169\n00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:34.420\nWell, wait a minute, hold on,\nwhen not equal to yes,\n\n170\n00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:40.100\nbecause in our minds what we have to do in\norder to determine if it's not equal to,\n\n171\n00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.300\nwe gotta ask ourseves,\nwell are they equal?\n\n172\n00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:46.630\nThen we answer yes or\nno, and then we flip it.\n\n173\n00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:50.160\nThere's actually an inherent\ntwo-step process, and\n\n174\n00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.720\nI'm projecting it a little bit, but when\nI've interacted with other people they go,\n\n175\n00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.600\nwell, all right, yes is yes, but, no.\n\n176\n00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:03.110\nThere's like this inherent not\nkind of flipping the operator\n\n177\n00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:05.810\nafter determining whether they are equal.\n\n178\n00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:08.310\n&gt;&gt; It's almost like when you\nspeak another language or\n\n179\n00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:09.710\ntrying to learn another language.\n\n180\n00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:11.190\nYou say it in English in your head and\n\n181\n00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:14.040\nyou flip it around and then you try\nto spit it back out as Spanish.\n\n182\n00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.670\nAnd then in my case, unfortunately,\nit gets all sorts of wrong.\n\n183\n00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:21.405\nBut cuz yes is yes, it does equal yes.\n\n184\n00:10:21.405 --> 00:10:26.980\nSo no, it doesn't equal yes,\nso it's false.\n\n185\n00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:32.218\nSo I had to internally take the true or\nyes and say no.\n\n186\n00:10:32.218 --> 00:10:39.692\nAnd that is essentially what not does,\ntrue yields false, false yields true.\n\n187\n00:10:39.692 --> 00:10:46.440\nThat s the definition of not, but\nit was so hard to keep straight.\n\n188\n00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.130\n&gt;&gt; And this is one of those\ntimes where I think strings or\n\n189\n00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:50.840\nwords actually exarcebate this issue.\n\n190\n00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:55.740\nBecause we look here you go,\nokay, is yes not equal to yes?\n\n191\n00:10:55.740 --> 00:11:01.140\nWell, wait a minute,\nyes is yes, so false, no.\n\n192\n00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.760\nIt was kind of like,\ndo you not like cheese, right?\n\n193\n00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.970\nBut wait a minute, I do like cheese,\nno, I do like cheese, right?\n\n194\n00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:09.340\nIs yes not equal to yes?\n\n195\n00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:12.920\nNo, yes is equal to yes.\n\n196\n00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.500\nSo that follow-up clarification.\n\n197\n00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:21.740\nBecause of that, I would recommend this\noperator to use exclusively with numbers.\n\n198\n00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:25.540\nNow, there maybe a time\nlike here where you need to\n\n199\n00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:29.535\ndetermine is this label here in order to\njust flip your logic, and this works fine.\n\n200\n00:11:29.535 --> 00:11:33.470\nThis is gonna be easier to\nreason about with numbers, okay?\n\n201\n00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:35.080\nIs four not equal to five?\n\n202\n00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.482\nI only wanna know if\nit's not equal to five,\n\n203\n00:11:38.482 --> 00:11:42.050\nthen that's my condition,\nthen this works fine.\n\n204\n00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:44.099\nBut I'll even go further than that.\n\n205\n00:11:44.099 --> 00:11:48.020\nBecause we talked about that\ninherent two step process, right?\n\n206\n00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.099\nOkay, I determined its quality and\nthen I flipped it.\n\n207\n00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:56.870\nIf you come over here, you'll notice\nfalse, false, false, false, true,\n\n208\n00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:01.550\ntrue, false, false, true, true, you'll\nnotice both of those columns are the same.\n\n209\n00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:07.510\nThat means whatever is in this cell\nevaluates to whatever's in this cell, and-\n\n210\n00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:09.190\n&gt;&gt; Actually it's the same thing.\n\n211\n00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:09.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n212\n00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:11.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I'm getting there.\n\n213\n00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:11.970\nI'm getting there.\n\n214\n00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:13.130\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.\n\n215\n00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:14.220\nBut we are evaluating B7.\n\n216\n00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:15.670\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n217\n00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:16.550\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\nSo-\n\n218\n00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:18.360\n&gt;&gt; Just making sure, sorry.\n\n219\n00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.130\nKeep going [LAUGH].\n\n220\n00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:23.740\n&gt;&gt; So both of these columns evaluate\nthe same thing, and that's because instead\n\n221\n00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:29.120\nof using that operator,\nequals not B7 is yes.\n\n222\n00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.323\nHere's that two step process.\n\n223\n00:12:30.323 --> 00:12:32.165\nLet's go ahead and look at the enter.\n\n224\n00:12:32.165 --> 00:12:34.096\nIs B7 yes?\n\n225\n00:12:34.096 --> 00:12:35.678\nWell, yes.\n\n226\n00:12:35.678 --> 00:12:37.570\nIs it not that though?\n\n227\n00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:38.220\nSo what do I do?\n\n228\n00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:42.180\nI take that yes and I flip it a no, or\ntake that true and flip it to false.\n\n229\n00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:48.284\nThis is a little easier to reason about\nfor me, and I found typically for\n\n230\n00:12:48.284 --> 00:12:49.193\nother people.\n\n231\n00:12:49.193 --> 00:12:52.234\nYou may be the exception to that.\n\n232\n00:12:52.234 --> 00:12:57.396\nBut take this not and now you have not\nonly the ability to have that in here,\n\n233\n00:12:57.396 --> 00:13:00.893\na two step process, but\nalso expand beyond that,\n\n234\n00:13:00.893 --> 00:13:05.080\ncuz this doesn't necessarily\nhave to be inequality.\n\n235\n00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.880\nIt can be any kind of logical test.\n\n236\n00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:13.050\nAny kind of comparison or\nmultiple comparisons, okay?\n\n237\n00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:19.050\nSo the not operator, all it does is,\nthink of it, if you walk into a room and\n\n238\n00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:24.045\nthe light's on, well, turn it off, that's\nwhat NOT does, it just flips the switch.\n\n239\n00:13:24.045 --> 00:13:28.843\nSo,along those lines,\nnot doesn't seem too bad,\n\n240\n00:13:28.843 --> 00:13:33.421\nbut if we come over here to this,\n[SOUND] all right,\n\n241\n00:13:33.421 --> 00:13:37.564\nI'm gonna try my best\nto keep this straight,\n\n242\n00:13:37.564 --> 00:13:42.172\nI was on the other side of\nthis in another episode.\n\n243\n00:13:42.172 --> 00:13:45.844\nSo Vonne, I'm gonna have to ask you to\nkeep me honest if I get this mixed up.\n\n244\n00:13:45.844 --> 00:13:49.340\nI don't want to tell the wrong bad\nkitties that they're bad or whatever.\n\n245\n00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:54.630\nBut if I meow too much or\n\n246\n00:13:54.630 --> 00:14:00.637\nI swipe too much, is that right?\n\n247\n00:14:00.637 --> 00:14:01.813\nIf I don't, no wait a minute.\n\n248\n00:14:01.813 --> 00:14:03.558\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n249\n00:14:03.558 --> 00:14:06.460\n&gt;&gt; So you already got it backwards\n&gt;&gt; We're already getting ourselves\n\n250\n00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:09.360\nconfused and that's why we're like,\nI don't want to jump in too quick, meow,\n\n251\n00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:15.030\nI don't want to jump in too quickly with\nthat, so we have meows more than 5, okay.\n\n252\n00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:19.870\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So if meow too much, and\n\n253\n00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:24.470\nyou swipe too much, yes you're bad,\nso we're again flipping it.\n\n254\n00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:29.298\nSo we wanna make sure that\nit's lower swipes, more meows,\n\n255\n00:14:29.298 --> 00:14:34.560\nthat's good, So [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right,\n\n256\n00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.150\nso we're meowing to get attention,\nbut we're not swiping to get attention\n\n257\n00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:42.400\nis effectively what, so you'll notice\nsomething, we're having this discussion.\n\n258\n00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.910\nAnd this is what it boils down to with\nlogic, you have to develop some kind of\n\n259\n00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:50.470\nway of thinking about what you're trying\nto achieve necessary to really kind of\n\n260\n00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:55.440\nwrangle with it in your mind because\nif you don't phrase it just right in\n\n261\n00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:00.080\norder for you to understand, then you\ncan get your logic backwards, all right.\n\n262\n00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.066\nLogic is not easy.\n\n263\n00:15:02.066 --> 00:15:05.732\nSo if we look here,\nlet's just look on it separately,\n\n264\n00:15:05.732 --> 00:15:09.012\njust as a quick review,\nmore than equal to five.\n\n265\n00:15:09.012 --> 00:15:15.054\nSo that means if you meow enough\nto get attention, then hey,\n\n266\n00:15:15.054 --> 00:15:21.470\nokay I got you, but\ncorrespondingly swipes is less than three.\n\n267\n00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:24.100\nYou don't want to get smacked by a cat.\n\n268\n00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:31.650\nSo okay, you are a good cat\nif either of those is true.\n\n269\n00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:32.820\nDo I have that correct?\n\n270\n00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.350\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you are correct.\n\n271\n00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:38.320\n&gt;&gt; All right, so if either, now notice I\nsaid either, so that's where this or, so\n\n272\n00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.040\nas long as you do one or the other.\n\n273\n00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:44.190\nNow if you don't do either, right?\n\n274\n00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:47.930\nOr neither of them, then that's a bad cat.\n\n275\n00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:53.160\nSo we looked at this if statement,\nand okay.\n\n276\n00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.913\n&gt;&gt; Straightforward if statement and\nthe positive.\n\n277\n00:15:55.913 --> 00:15:58.492\nOkay, if we look at yeah,\njust like we did in the or.\n\n278\n00:15:58.492 --> 00:16:03.305\nThis is like you said, either, or,\nIf your good, you get a treat.\n\n279\n00:16:03.305 --> 00:16:05.001\nIf your bad, you do not get a treat.\n\n280\n00:16:05.001 --> 00:16:07.810\nSo, no, not.\n\n281\n00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:10.310\nSo there's no not in this.\n\n282\n00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:14.164\nSo if we look at this,\nif you do either one of those, right?\n\n283\n00:16:14.164 --> 00:16:15.129\nThen you get a treat.\n\n284\n00:16:15.129 --> 00:16:17.970\nAnd correspondingly, you're a good kitty.\n\n285\n00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:21.000\nAnd otherwise you get not a treat,\nand we only have no treat.\n\n286\n00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.730\nNow, if we come here and\nwe look at the not, obviously,\n\n287\n00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:25.460\nthat's going to flip, right?\n\n288\n00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:29.490\nSo we're, there's actually a,\nthere's a formula here.\n\n289\n00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:31.320\nRight?\nWe still keep that OR.\n\n290\n00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:35.620\nThere's no reference of that other column.\n\n291\n00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:40.220\nSo, if not, condition A or condition B.\n\n292\n00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.390\nRight?\n\n293\n00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:43.370\nAnd it is flipped.\n\n294\n00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:47.870\nTrue goes to false, true goes to false,\ntrue goes to false, false goes to true.\n\n295\n00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:51.610\nBut, then what's interesting\nis by introducing that not and\n\n296\n00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:55.280\nagain just very superficial,\nlet's look at this.\n\n297\n00:16:56.390 --> 00:17:00.940\nWe're gonna come in here and\nsay, if not either one of those,\n\n298\n00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.850\nthat means you've done neither, right?\n\n299\n00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:07.718\nNot or, is neither then bad cat,\ngood kitty.\n\n300\n00:17:07.718 --> 00:17:11.540\nNotice that the order of those, right?\n\n301\n00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:12.506\nBad is first.\n\n302\n00:17:12.506 --> 00:17:16.000\nWell what if we phrase it in the positive,\nright?\n\n303\n00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:16.820\nIn this if statement.\n\n304\n00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:22.590\nNotice, treat which implies\ngood kitty is first.\n\n305\n00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:27.260\nBy using that not, your if statement,\nall you've done is switched them.\n\n306\n00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.250\nSo that's why I'm gonna come\nback to something I said at\n\n307\n00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:31.050\nthe beginning of this episode.\n\n308\n00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:34.220\nWhen you can, phrase it in the positive.\n\n309\n00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:42.050\nBecause the if statement is this, if this\ncondition, do this, otherwise, do this.\n\n310\n00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:43.310\nRight?\n\n311\n00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:48.370\nIf that's true, then do this first thing,\nreturn that value.\n\n312\n00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:49.700\nOtherwise, return this other value.\n\n313\n00:17:50.858 --> 00:17:55.420\nIf you not it, then you have to remember,\nokay I gotta flip them because if I'm not\n\n314\n00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:59.620\nthen effectively, what I'm doing is say\nreturn this one in the negation of this.\n\n315\n00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:01.090\nSee how it's hard,\nlike it's a lot of words.\n\n316\n00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:06.750\nSo not will flip the bit and by flipping\nthe bit, you turn the light off or on.\n\n317\n00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:07.820\nIf it's off, turn it on.\n\n318\n00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:08.909\nIf it's on, turn it off.\n\n319\n00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:13.980\nBut do keep in mind that when\nused in conjunction with Or and\n\n320\n00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.600\nAnd, it actually changes.\n\n321\n00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:22.303\nLogically speaking, if not OR, right?\n\n322\n00:18:22.303 --> 00:18:27.856\nThis, or this, is the same as saying and.\n\n323\n00:18:27.856 --> 00:18:33.570\nAnd actually when I add to this\nVonne just to hop in here.\n\n324\n00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:34.890\nThe escape key.\n\n325\n00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:36.010\nEscape key, aww, man.\n\n326\n00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:41.680\nYou've got some keys in here,\nlike I said this is not my computer.\n\n327\n00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.500\nIt's always weird when you\nflip computers [LAUGH].\n\n328\n00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:47.500\nSo, I'm going to look at this, so\nif we look at this formula, not or\n\n329\n00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:51.810\nthis and this All right so\nI'm gonna grab this and I'm gonna copy.\n\n330\n00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:53.416\nNope.\nWe're also on virtual so\n\n331\n00:18:53.416 --> 00:18:56.168\nuse the control key and\nnot the command key [LAUGH].\n\n332\n00:18:56.168 --> 00:18:58.234\nYeah, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+C.\n\n333\n00:18:58.234 --> 00:19:01.380\nAll right so, escape.\n\n334\n00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:04.055\nWow Vonne, you make this look so\neasy and it's not.\n\n335\n00:19:04.055 --> 00:19:08.000\n[LAUGH] So then we're gonna\ndouble click into here, alright?\n\n336\n00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.870\nSo, what I'm gonna do is we're using\nthis and instead of OR, right?\n\n337\n00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:17.190\nI'm gonna change this to an AND,\nlet me zoom in here.\n\n338\n00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:19.360\nSo And.\n\n339\n00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:24.820\nAnd then, I'm gonna put a NOT right here.\n\n340\n00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:28.641\nAnd this is just to show you\none when in doubt, right?\n\n341\n00:19:28.641 --> 00:19:29.143\nTry some things out.\n\n342\n00:19:32.012 --> 00:19:35.912\nSo we go here and\nI need to come back over here and\n\n343\n00:19:35.912 --> 00:19:41.239\nremove, Right?\n\n344\n00:19:41.239 --> 00:19:43.020\nRemove that and boom.\n\n345\n00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.720\nNow, let's zoom back out and\n\n346\n00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:50.910\nwe're gonna now,\ngonna just drag this down and boom.\n\n347\n00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:53.878\nNotice that these two values\nare exactly the same.\n\n348\n00:19:55.524 --> 00:19:58.419\nWhen you see these two values,\nif you not and or,\n\n349\n00:19:58.419 --> 00:20:02.250\nit's the same as anding\nthe not of the two enters.\n\n350\n00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:06.178\nSo you kinda [SOUND] you rearrange.\n\n351\n00:20:06.178 --> 00:20:09.574\nBut I'll show you that not necessary so\nyou're remember that and\n\n352\n00:20:09.574 --> 00:20:11.560\nthis is just about phrasing, right?\n\n353\n00:20:13.712 --> 00:20:19.280\nI either have not done either\none of these, the alternative is\n\n354\n00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:28.230\nI have not meowed more than five times and\nnot swiped less than five.\n\n355\n00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:30.466\nNotice how I added two nots in there.\n\n356\n00:20:30.466 --> 00:20:33.410\nWhen you can, eliminate the not.\n\n357\n00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:39.120\nIf you can't, then try to\neliminate more than one of them.\n\n358\n00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:44.640\nSee I have not, not, and this is just a\nrecommendation based on my experience with\n\n359\n00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.080\nhaving discussions about logic.\n\n360\n00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:52.450\nThis is going to cause you a little\nmore problems than saying,\n\n361\n00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:54.470\nokay, did I do this or this?\n\n362\n00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:55.980\nNope, then just flip that.\n\n363\n00:20:55.980 --> 00:21:00.250\nYeah because, yeah you're OR\njust became an AND.\n\n364\n00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:04.455\nAnd the AND became and OR and, whoo it is.\n\n365\n00:21:04.455 --> 00:21:07.215\nIt's hard, I mean,\nthat's why we practice this,\n\n366\n00:21:07.215 --> 00:21:12.165\nbe ready to just kind of say,\nyes, logic is NOT easy.\n\n367\n00:21:12.165 --> 00:21:16.655\nIt is really difficult to\nunderstand the not part of it.\n\n368\n00:21:16.655 --> 00:21:21.055\nAnd the other thing is going back to,\nif we were, do I want a good kitty or\n\n369\n00:21:21.055 --> 00:21:21.575\na bad kitty?\n\n370\n00:21:21.575 --> 00:21:28.310\nIt's more of also how you're asking\nthe data for what you want to yield.\n\n371\n00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:33.610\nAnd like you said, sometimes you really\nhave to try to flip it back around.\n\n372\n00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:36.900\nBut I wanna know if what's a good cat or\na bad cat.\n\n373\n00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:42.621\nAnd there's multiple ways\nto get to the same result.\n\n374\n00:21:42.621 --> 00:21:45.500\nDo you use the not,\ndo you not use the not?\n\n375\n00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:46.534\nDo you use the and?\n\n376\n00:21:46.534 --> 00:21:47.370\nDo you use the or?\n\n377\n00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:51.493\nIt hurts, it actually hurts my brain.\n\n378\n00:21:51.493 --> 00:21:55.867\n[LAUGH] And it's funny because\nthis exemplifies a common example,\n\n379\n00:21:55.867 --> 00:22:00.448\nlogic is not easy, or I could say logic\nis hard, I've eliminated the not,\n\n380\n00:22:00.448 --> 00:22:03.200\nbecause not easy is difficult Right?\n\n381\n00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.690\nOr difficult, hard, let's just say hard.\n\n382\n00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:08.756\nNow, you and\nI are talking before this episode and\n\n383\n00:22:08.756 --> 00:22:12.140\nwe were talking about getting a loan or\nsomething like that.\n\n384\n00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:15.030\nAnd it was funny because as we were\ntalking, Vonne was like, well,\n\n385\n00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:20.460\nI wanna say you're rejected if\nany of these is broken, right?\n\n386\n00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:23.150\nNot this, not this or not this.\n\n387\n00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:26.370\nAnd I was like well, why don't you just\nsay you're accepted if they're all?\n\n388\n00:22:27.821 --> 00:22:31.791\nI removed all nots and just say you\ngotta have all of these in order to get\n\n389\n00:22:31.791 --> 00:22:36.180\naccepted, and the only way that you get\nrejected is if you're not accepted.\n\n390\n00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:41.314\nSo now I've said,\nrejection is based on not accepted.\n\n391\n00:22:41.314 --> 00:22:43.200\nAnd I've kind of moved those around.\n\n392\n00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.048\nThat takes some practice.\n\n393\n00:22:44.048 --> 00:22:47.880\nAnd you may not use not all the time,\nbut it is there,\n\n394\n00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:52.190\nyou just need to turn on the light switch\nwhen it's off or turn it off when it's on.\n\n395\n00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:53.700\nSo, definitely realize that.\n\n396\n00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:58.520\nAsk questions in the positive if you can,\nand well other than that,\n\n397\n00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:00.668\nI think that's a pretty\ngood overview of not.\n\n398\n00:23:00.668 --> 00:23:06.390\nWhoo yes, that was really good Justin,\nbecause and this is why\n\n399\n00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:11.880\nwe flipped it around on you guys, to just\nkinda get a different perspective on this.\n\n400\n00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:16.810\nBecause I'll tell you, I was having\nproblems and he's like, you know what,\n\n401\n00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:18.890\nyou just go over there,\nI think it's much easier.\n\n402\n00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:20.810\nAnd sometimes that's what we have to do,\n\n403\n00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:25.310\nwe have to step back, take a different\nperspective and flip the script.\n\n404\n00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:28.550\nSo I think I just kinda repeated\nthat a couple of different times.\n\n405\n00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:31.640\nSo we are the redundancy department or\nredundancy and\n\n406\n00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:34.060\nI think that means it's\ntime to get on out of here.\n\n407\n00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:37.010\nSo thank you so much for watching,\nbut signing off for Office Pro TV.\n\n408\n00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:38.700\nI've been your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n409\n00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:39.250\nAnd I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n410\n00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:40.307\nAnd we'll see you soon.\n\n411\n00:23:40.307 --> 00:23:44.230\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

I'm doing fantastic.\n\n13\n00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.460\nHow are you?\n\n14\n00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.170\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic as well.\n\n15\n00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.320\nMatch, some of these functions,\n\n16\n00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.870\nyou would think they would be\nmore explanatory in their nature.\n\n17\n00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.350\nObviously, you can go read\nabout the documentation but\n\n18\n00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.070\nmatch, why would I care about using match?\n\n19\n00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and the word itself,\nwe think hey,\n\n20\n00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.060\nI want to match this with this or\nfind the match.\n\n21\n00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.520\nRemember the memory where you flip\nover a cards and everything, and\n\n22\n00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.420\nyou take a pair and you're like they match\nand you get that into your little pile.\n\n23\n00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.325\nIt's nothing like that.\n\n24\n00:01:01.325 --> 00:01:04.160\n[LAUGH] It's kind of strange.\n\n25\n00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:10.225\nSo, what it's going to do is,\nis it's going to return the position\n\n26\n00:01:10.225 --> 00:01:15.560\nof an element in a array.\n\n27\n00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.860\nWe'll get around to it, okay?\n\n28\n00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.585\nThis is again one of those functions that,\nby itself, you're like, okay, but\n\n29\n00:01:21.585 --> 00:01:26.350\nthere are some other examples in\nanother episode where this is gonna\n\n30\n00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.910\nkind of come back into play\nwith the index episode.\n\n31\n00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.340\nSo definitely watch that.\n\n32\n00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.110\nAnd see where it's like,\nI see where I can use this.\n\n33\n00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.550\nJust like a lot of our functions in this\nlibrary that you've been looking through.\n\n34\n00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.920\nI think she's said that\nin every single episode.\n\n35\n00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.760\nYeah, I pretty much have, so\nwe are gonna get started.\n\n36\n00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.130\nWe are gonna play a little game Justin,\nare you ready?\n\n37\n00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.880\n&gt;&gt; I'm as ready as I can be.\n\n38\n00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.860\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so why don't we go ahead and\n\n39\n00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.740\njump down into the screen and\nI will show you where we are at.\n\n40\n00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.110\nSo I've got some cats, right?\n\n41\n00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.996\nI thought I would mix it up a little\nbit there Justin, I put in some dogs.\n\n42\n00:02:01.996 --> 00:02:05.139\n[LAUGH] Justin's face went [SOUND] what?\n\n43\n00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:07.680\n[LAUGH] Yes, I put in some dog names.\n\n44\n00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.990\nSo I have Wolfie.\n\n45\n00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.960\nYes, that was one of my dogs.\n\n46\n00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.260\nAnd Albert, Poochie,\nDaffodil, BeeBoo and Jack.\n\n47\n00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.228\nOkay, the first four were animal that I\ngrew up with, last, they were good friends\n\n48\n00:02:21.228 --> 00:02:26.714\ndog that was so cute that'd run around\nthe coffee table and Jack was a boxer.\n\n49\n00:02:26.714 --> 00:02:32.327\nAnyway, in case if you wanna know about\nwhat this function's actually about,\n\n50\n00:02:32.327 --> 00:02:35.364\nJustin, I'm going to ask you a question.\n\n51\n00:02:35.364 --> 00:02:39.429\nIf you look at this list of cats,\ntell me what number in,\n\n52\n00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:42.550\nfrom top to bottom, what number is Fuego?\n\n53\n00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.260\nAnd this is not like your coding stuff.\n\n54\n00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.560\nSo regular stuff.\n\n55\n00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.550\n&gt;&gt; From top it's the first number.\n\n56\n00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.630\nIs that what you're asking?\n\n57\n00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.870\nIt's the number five.\n\n58\n00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.185\n&gt;&gt; What position is\nFuego within this list?\n\n59\n00:02:52.185 --> 00:02:53.465\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\nI'm sorry, sorry, sorry.\n\n60\n00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:56.314\n&gt;&gt; That's what I should maybe clarify.\n\n61\n00:02:56.314 --> 00:02:57.105\n&gt;&gt; I was like, I'm sorry.\n\n62\n00:02:57.105 --> 00:02:58.315\nOne, two, three, four.\n\n63\n00:02:58.315 --> 00:02:59.175\nIt's number four.\n\n64\n00:02:59.175 --> 00:02:59.725\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n65\n00:02:59.725 --> 00:03:02.920\n&gt;&gt; That's why you looked so\nconfused when I said five.\n\n66\n00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.315\n[LAUGH] You were like, what?\n\n67\n00:03:05.315 --> 00:03:08.351\n&gt;&gt; And then I'm like,\nmaybe he didn't hear me say Fuego, and\n\n68\n00:03:08.351 --> 00:03:09.885\n[LAUGH] got a little confused.\n\n69\n00:03:09.885 --> 00:03:14.320\nAnd I also mentioned,\nnot like your coding stuff,\n\n70\n00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.510\nbecause in, I know we are doing\na show in DevPro about Python.\n\n71\n00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.290\nAnd we have a zero index strings.\n\n72\n00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.240\nAnd when you are looking at a length\nof string and it's characters,\n\n73\n00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.100\nit actually starts counting from zero.\n\n74\n00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.690\nSo it's like zero, one, two, three.\n\n75\n00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.140\nSo I didn't want you to say three,\nand then I'm going, what?\n\n76\n00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.245\nNo, it's four, okay?\n\n77\n00:03:33.245 --> 00:03:35.182\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So I went ahead and said five.\n\n78\n00:03:35.182 --> 00:03:36.320\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n79\n00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.533\n&gt;&gt; I said some crazy stuff.\n\n80\n00:03:37.533 --> 00:03:39.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so he is number four.\n\n81\n00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:40.765\nWe'll get there.\n\n82\n00:03:40.765 --> 00:03:45.370\n[LAUGH] All right, that's all you just\nwent down and said, he's number four.\n\n83\n00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.470\nOkay, so\nin this list what number is Daffodil?\n\n84\n00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.790\n&gt;&gt; Also four.\n\n85\n00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.370\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I didn't mean to do that,\nbut yes it is number four.\n\n86\n00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.900\nThat is exactly what the match\nfunction is going to do.\n\n87\n00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.630\nIt is going to say look up a value.\n\n88\n00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.110\nSo these are the different arguments\nthat are in a match function.\n\n89\n00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.030\nThere was a lookup value.\n\n90\n00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.400\nI said look, tell me where Fuego is?\n\n91\n00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.800\nSo that was your value that\nI wanted you to look up.\n\n92\n00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.880\nThen I said, in this list.\n\n93\n00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.380\nThis is the list.\n\n94\n00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.440\nThat would be the second argument.\n\n95\n00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.362\nAnd then there this third argument of\na match type, and there's zero, one and\n\n96\n00:04:29.362 --> 00:04:30.380\nnegative one.\n\n97\n00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.130\nWhat that means,\n\n98\n00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.855\nis whether you want an exact match,\nor sorting ascending, or descending.\n\n99\n00:04:36.855 --> 00:04:39.800\nWe'll come back around and\nexamples like how about we do this?\n\n100\n00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.780\nSo Justin, in this list,\ntell me what position is 15?\n\n101\n00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.180\n&gt;&gt; Position three.\n\n102\n00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:54.898\n&gt;&gt; What if I say what would be 12?\n\n103\n00:04:54.898 --> 00:04:58.290\n&gt;&gt; What would be the 12th\nnumber of where would 12 be?\n\n104\n00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.560\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so let me clarify.\n\n105\n00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.163\nAll right, so okay, with this positions,\nso we have one, two, three,\n\n106\n00:05:04.163 --> 00:05:05.517\nfour, five, okay?\n\n107\n00:05:05.517 --> 00:05:08.406\nIt can only mean one of these positions.\n\n108\n00:05:08.406 --> 00:05:11.330\nWhat is 12, without going over.\n\n109\n00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.680\nWhat position would that be?\n\n110\n00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.610\n&gt;&gt; That would be three.\n\n111\n00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:17.630\nWould it be two?\n\n112\n00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:23.240\n&gt;&gt; Yes, this is the way that the function\nworks without going over, right?\n\n113\n00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.840\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, alright, so\nlet me further clarify why I said three.\n\n114\n00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.377\nThere's something that I do that will tell\nyou the position that it gets inserted\n\n115\n00:05:31.377 --> 00:05:33.238\ninto if it were found.\n\n116\n00:05:33.238 --> 00:05:36.660\n&gt;&gt; Okay\n&gt;&gt; That's why I was like it's gonna be in\n\n117\n00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.459\nthe third position, but\n15's over, 10's under,\n\n118\n00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:44.030\n10's the last thing,\nso ten is position two.\n\n119\n00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.360\nIt would be inserted in three but\nit's one more than ten so.\n\n120\n00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.740\n&gt;&gt; Further clarification there.\n\n121\n00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.110\nMy brain's wired a little different.\n\n122\n00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I might not have been as\nclear as what would be the position\n\n123\n00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:55.700\nof these five?\n\n124\n00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.280\nYou would have to pick one but you\ncan't go over it, so it has to be less.\n\n125\n00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.310\nSo you'd be one, two, three.\n\n126\n00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.190\nWait, that's too much.\n\n127\n00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.420\nSo let me back up one, or go up one.\n\n128\n00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:10.020\nAnd okay, so that'd be ten, so\nthen it would be position two.\n\n129\n00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:15.380\nThat's what I'm trying to get at is\nto what this match type is going to\n\n130\n00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.110\ncome back to you.\n\n131\n00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.339\nThe same would be for\nthis its just in the opposite, okay?\n\n132\n00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:25.903\nInstead of notice these are in\na ascending order, correct?\n\n133\n00:06:25.903 --> 00:06:29.420\nThat's gonna be something that's very\nimportant in this particular function.\n\n134\n00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:35.156\nThis is descending order,\nso what would be 50?\n\n135\n00:06:35.156 --> 00:06:36.910\nThat would be position?\n\n136\n00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.027\n&gt;&gt; Three.\n&gt;&gt; Three, and\n\n137\n00:06:39.027 --> 00:06:43.841\nthen if I said what would be 60?\n\n138\n00:06:43.841 --> 00:06:49.010\nIt's the same idea but\nnow it's like it can't be less.\n\n139\n00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it can go under.\n\n140\n00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.860\nIt can’t overshoot the value so to speak.\n\n141\n00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:53.710\n&gt;&gt; Going down.\n\n142\n00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:54.880\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Going down.\n\n143\n00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.000\nSo 60 would be position two.\n\n144\n00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.380\n&gt;&gt; Right, because 50 is already less so\n\n145\n00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:05.730\nrelative ordering in these dictates\nthat behavior effectively,\n\n146\n00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:09.470\nwhich brings up the following question and\ntell me if I’m getting ahead of myself.\n\n147\n00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:13.590\nI guess there's kind of a supposition\nthat these are ordered, right?\n\n148\n00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.430\nDo they have to be ordered for\nthis function to work in predictable ways?\n\n149\n00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:22.340\n&gt;&gt; Yes, when you're doing\nthese particular match types.\n\n150\n00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.450\nOkay, so yes,\nthat is a key factor in this.\n\n151\n00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:30.070\nSo that's just explaining\nthe the logic if you want to say,\n\n152\n00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:35.690\nthis isn't logical format or\nfunction, those get really scary,\n\n153\n00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:40.440\ngo back and watch our not\nepisode that's a doozy [LAUGH].\n\n154\n00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:45.658\nSo were gonna just do exactly what\nthe function does is, return the value.\n\n155\n00:07:45.658 --> 00:07:51.233\nAnd just for fun, I went ahead and\nbrought up the website with the support.\n\n156\n00:07:51.233 --> 00:07:55.785\nIt just says it searches for\na specified admin arrange cells then\n\n157\n00:07:55.785 --> 00:07:59.842\nreturns the relative position\nof that item in the range.\n\n158\n00:07:59.842 --> 00:08:02.653\nWhich is exactly what I\nwas having Justin do.\n\n159\n00:08:02.653 --> 00:08:05.777\nSo why don't we write this function.\n\n160\n00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:09.750\nBishop in this range, we already\nknow that's gonna be one, correct?\n\n161\n00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:14.310\nNow when we're doing text, now this\ncould just as well be numbers, but\n\n162\n00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:17.280\nin this particular one\nwe want an exact match.\n\n163\n00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.649\nOkay, if there's not like a, and\n\n164\n00:08:18.649 --> 00:08:20.830\nespecially with text,\nit's gonna be kind of a weird.\n\n165\n00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:25.650\nYou can't do what's the closest\nwithout going over with the eighth,\n\n166\n00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:27.730\nand it doesn't really work that well.\n\n167\n00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:32.400\nSo this, for text you probably\nwant it to be an exact match.\n\n168\n00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.470\nJust throwing it out there, I'm not gonna\ngo this far this particular episode.\n\n169\n00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:40.219\nBut it does say that you can\nuse some wildcard characters\n\n170\n00:08:40.219 --> 00:08:44.370\nright here with your asterisks and\neverything.\n\n171\n00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:48.732\nFor right now, we're just gonna\njust nod our heads and say okay,\n\n172\n00:08:48.732 --> 00:08:51.740\ngreat, that's an available option.\n\n173\n00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.870\nBut I'm just trying to keep it easy and\nget us to understand\n\n174\n00:08:55.870 --> 00:09:00.544\nthe functionality of the function so\nwe'll leave that for another day.\n\n175\n00:09:00.544 --> 00:09:02.470\nHow do I write this?\n\n176\n00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:04.302\nLet's go to the insert\nfunction dialogue box.\n\n177\n00:09:04.302 --> 00:09:08.355\nI've already got it pulled up,\nyou know that you can type it on the go,\n\n178\n00:09:08.355 --> 00:09:09.820\nwe're doing the match.\n\n179\n00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:12.744\nAnd then it says,\nhere is the lookup value,\n\n180\n00:09:12.744 --> 00:09:17.500\nthe value that you use to find [LAUGH]\nI'm like, am I reading that wrong?\n\n181\n00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:26.043\nIs the value you use to find the value\nyou want in the array, okay [LAUGH].\n\n182\n00:09:26.043 --> 00:09:30.365\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] This must be\nlegacy like I don't know,\n\n183\n00:09:30.365 --> 00:09:33.907\nmaybe this is, that's worded odd.\n\n184\n00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:35.340\n&gt;&gt; I know, and I got so.\n\n185\n00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.320\n&gt;&gt; That's worded oddly.\n\n186\n00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.066\n&gt;&gt; I got so flustered, I closed it.\n\n187\n00:09:38.066 --> 00:09:41.620\n[LAUGH] after that we're gonna finish\nthe actual function in here so\n\n188\n00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:43.990\nI was like It's the thing\nyou need to look up.\n\n189\n00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:45.460\nAll right, so what are we doing?\n\n190\n00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.820\nWe're doing a cell reference,\nwe're gonna say cell A2.\n\n191\n00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:52.182\nYou could just as easily type in a value\nif you wanted to hard code it, but\n\n192\n00:09:52.182 --> 00:09:54.450\nwe're doing a cell reference.\n\n193\n00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:58.170\nThe lookup array, an array is\njust a collection of information,\n\n194\n00:09:58.170 --> 00:09:59.410\nit's a range of cells.\n\n195\n00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:02.280\nSo I am going to look this up here.\n\n196\n00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:06.930\nIn this list of cats,\nthrew a couple extra cats in there.\n\n197\n00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:11.502\nWe haven't seen Speck before, he's my\nhusband's cat from way back in the day,\n\n198\n00:10:11.502 --> 00:10:12.386\nadorable cat.\n\n199\n00:10:12.386 --> 00:10:16.808\n[LAUGH] So we will go with match type, and\n\n200\n00:10:16.808 --> 00:10:23.280\nyou can see it has 1, 0,\nor -1, for exact, it is 0.\n\n201\n00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.620\nSo that's what we would like.\n\n202\n00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:28.650\nWe go ahead and click okay,\nand just like I would ask you,\n\n203\n00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:32.326\nit is position number one in this list.\n\n204\n00:10:32.326 --> 00:10:35.880\nCool, so I'm gonna copy this down, but\n\n205\n00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:40.720\nI do need to go ahead and\nmake an absolute reference of this.\n\n206\n00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.730\nSo let's go ahead and\nput those dollar signs in.\n\n207\n00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:51.320\nAnd make sure, somehow my function\nkey has a, I'm hitting the caps lock.\n\n208\n00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:56.120\nHold on, okay,\nhow many times am I going to do this?\n\n209\n00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:00.940\nWe need F6, is that it?\n\n210\n00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:05.250\nThank you, F5, okay, goodness, all right.\n\n211\n00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:06.590\nOne of these days I'll\nget this word right.\n\n212\n00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:09.750\nPerfect, so now I have absolute\nreference of this list.\n\n213\n00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:11.220\nThere we go, we take this.\n\n214\n00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:15.990\nAnd now I'm just gonna do one at\na time for demonstration purposes.\n\n215\n00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:20.530\nSo here it says fuego is in position\nnumber four, which is correct,\n\n216\n00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:23.390\nbut that's a lower case fuego.\n\n217\n00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:26.300\nThis is just demonstrating\nthat it is case insensitive.\n\n218\n00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.120\nIt does not, it is not case sensitive.\n\n219\n00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.470\nSo you could have upper or\n\n220\n00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:34.910\nlower, mixture of them,\nit's just gonna find the characters.\n\n221\n00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:36.480\nBut what about duplicates?\n\n222\n00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:42.300\nPumpkin is in this list twice,\nin position three, and in position five.\n\n223\n00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.530\nSo if I pull this down,\nwhich one is it going to return?\n\n224\n00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:48.430\nIt's only going to return the first one.\n\n225\n00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:52.700\nIt does not treat duplicates this way,\nit won't say 3, 5 and 12,\n\n226\n00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.646\nit's just the first one.\n\n227\n00:11:54.646 --> 00:12:00.027\nNow Zanger right here,\nwe can see it's not Zanger,\n\n228\n00:12:00.027 --> 00:12:03.460\nit's Zinger is the cat's name.\n\n229\n00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:07.230\nSo when I pull this down, I can't find it.\n\n230\n00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:11.360\nThere's nothing there, so\nthat's the error that's going to happen.\n\n231\n00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.360\nAnd then, right here I have Puma,\nand I pull this down.\n\n232\n00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.920\nIt's not case sensitive,\nright, so it should work.\n\n233\n00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.170\nWhy is that?\n\n234\n00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.690\nAny thoughts there Justin?\n\n235\n00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:26.110\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna guess there's a hidden\nwhite space character somewhere.\n\n236\n00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:32.970\n&gt;&gt; You are correct, and its in the notes\ntoo, but yes that's this one right here.\n\n237\n00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:37.837\nThere is puma,\nthere is a white space in there and\n\n238\n00:12:37.837 --> 00:12:41.050\nthat is why it's not matching.\n\n239\n00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.868\nSo it has extra white space so\nif it's not exact,\n\n240\n00:12:44.868 --> 00:12:49.630\nin that sense, it could be\na little off putting right there.\n\n241\n00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:53.510\nSo, pretty cool,\nthat's what the match function does.\n\n242\n00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:56.755\nNow we could stop but I wanted to\nshow you a couple other examples.\n\n243\n00:12:56.755 --> 00:13:04.120\nIs because, the cool thing about match is\nthat it can be used horizontally, cool.\n\n244\n00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.840\nSo if I wanted to match, and\nI'm just going to type this in.\n\n245\n00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:14.210\nThis particular reference comma,\nwe want this range of cells.\n\n246\n00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:18.140\nLet's go ahead and\nI wish my function keys would work.\n\n247\n00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:21.150\nSo I could go ahead and click, my gosh!\n\n248\n00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:25.900\nSorry, this was not working at my\ndesk before we started this episode.\n\n249\n00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:29.420\nI guess, this decided to go ahead and\nfix itself, thank you.\n\n250\n00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:32.290\nAll right, so now I'm gonna go ahead and\nuse my exact match.\n\n251\n00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:35.460\nThat's what I want, here we go, perfect.\n\n252\n00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.800\nYou can see that Albert is\nin position number two.\n\n253\n00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:43.850\nAnd if I pull this down,\nyou can see that Daffodil is number four.\n\n254\n00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:47.510\nBee Boo, not spelled right, so that’s\nwhere you’re going to get that same error.\n\n255\n00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:52.500\nSo you can do, across, across, or down.\n\n256\n00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.520\nAnd that's the match function does.\n\n257\n00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.310\n&gt;&gt; And these are for strings, and\nyou may have actually said this.\n\n258\n00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:58.978\nSo this is just plain text.\n\n259\n00:13:58.978 --> 00:14:03.340\nI'm guessing 0 is always the entry if\nI'm looking through an array of text.\n\n260\n00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:07.880\nLike a range of text, or\nam I over simplifying it?\n\n261\n00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:11.090\n&gt;&gt; For me, I would use 0.\n\n262\n00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:14.280\nAnd now,\nare you asking if you didn't type it in?\n\n263\n00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.180\nLike if you didn't actually,\nor are you just saying-\n\n264\n00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.870\n&gt;&gt; So like, if we put negative 1 or\n\n265\n00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:19.320\n1 here, right?\n\n266\n00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.060\nBecause we talkede about those sort types.\n\n267\n00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.169\nAnd I know we haven't quite got there,\nbut we've been putting a 0, and\n\n268\n00:14:23.169 --> 00:14:24.010\nI saw that little drop down.\n\n269\n00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:25.120\nIt was less than or\n\n270\n00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.700\ngreater than, we talked about there\nneeded to be some kind of ordering.\n\n271\n00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:33.020\nWell with these list of names,\nordering is kind of ambiguous.\n\n272\n00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:35.770\nI guess you could do\nalphabetical ordering but.\n\n273\n00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:37.121\n&gt;&gt; Yeah let's go ahead and do it now,\n\n274\n00:14:37.121 --> 00:14:40.300\nnot that you're jumping ahead cuz we're\ngetting ready to show those examples.\n\n275\n00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.831\nSo why don't we change that, okay so\n\n276\n00:14:42.831 --> 00:14:46.628\nwhy don't we take this 0 in the match,\nand make it 1.\n\n277\n00:14:46.628 --> 00:14:49.820\nOkay, so 1, you can see it's got\nto be that less than, right.\n\n278\n00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:53.190\nSo if I go ahead and\nclick there, Bishop's fine.\n\n279\n00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:55.900\nRight, and I pull this down,\nremember, it's 1, 4, 3.\n\n280\n00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:00.480\n1, 1, 5, what?\n\n281\n00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:08.920\nIt did give us a match, or it gave us\na result, but it's it's not right, is it?\n\n282\n00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:14.410\nYeah, so this is where I can't find\nthe reasoning of what it's actually doing.\n\n283\n00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:17.330\nAll I know is that you should probably\njust go ahead and use 0 when you're\n\n284\n00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:20.830\nworking with text because it doesn't\ntreat it as greater than and less than.\n\n285\n00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:22.590\nYou don't really do that with text.\n\n286\n00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:27.450\nIt's not something that you\nevaluate if you want to say.\n\n287\n00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:28.050\n&gt;&gt; Hear me out on this.\n\n288\n00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:30.540\nWhat if we take that range of names,\nand we sort them?\n\n289\n00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:33.844\nWhat if we sort them alphabetically?\n\n290\n00:15:33.844 --> 00:15:36.820\n&gt;&gt; Okay, let's go with sorting A to Z.\n\n291\n00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:42.980\nOkay, so now we have Bishop is 1,\nFuego is 2,\n\n292\n00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:47.450\nPumpkin is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\n293\n00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:54.507\n&gt;&gt; But it looks like it splits\nthe difference when there's duplicates.\n\n294\n00:15:54.507 --> 00:15:57.108\nDuplicates are always gonna\nmess you up on this one.\n\n295\n00:15:57.108 --> 00:15:59.857\nBut it looks like if\nthey are sorted A to Z,\n\n296\n00:15:59.857 --> 00:16:04.664\nyou might get A little better results,\nbut you still may get weirdness.\n\n297\n00:16:04.664 --> 00:16:08.139\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and especially with text,\nto me, just go with zero, okay.\n\n298\n00:16:08.139 --> 00:16:13.210\nEverything that I can find,\nyou want to do exact match with text.\n\n299\n00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:16.650\nIt's only when you're doing numbers\nthat you can really go with the one or\n\n300\n00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:21.610\nthe negative one for whether you want\nit to be less than or greater than or\n\n301\n00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:25.040\nthe closest without\ngoing over type example.\n\n302\n00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.790\nWhy don't we go ahead and do that?\n\n303\n00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:27.820\nSo same thing here.\n\n304\n00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:32.600\nSo I put these little numbers off to\nthe side just to keep our brain in order.\n\n305\n00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:36.040\nAnd this is sorted ascending.\n\n306\n00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:41.430\nWe have to have that because when you\nget it into not sorted, just kind of\n\n307\n00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:47.050\nlike the text, it just gives you some\nwonky results that just don't make sense.\n\n308\n00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:50.630\nSo same idea, we'll go ahead and\nmatch this and\n\n309\n00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:53.720\nwe will look up this particular value.\n\n310\n00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:58.480\nWhoops, that's the wrong one,\nand two comma.\n\n311\n00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:04.750\nWe will grab this range, we will click\nthe F4 key which is working again, yea.\n\n312\n00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:09.960\nSo then I will comma, and\nnow we can see that we did the number one.\n\n313\n00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:15.250\nThat was that example of I wanna make sure\nthat we don't go over when I hit Enter.\n\n314\n00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:18.070\nNow ten matches, so\nthat's position number two.\n\n315\n00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.578\n15, that's going to be 3.\n\n316\n00:17:21.578 --> 00:17:25.440\nBut nine, where's nine gonna fall?\n\n317\n00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:30.990\nIt's looking down, it's greater than\nfive but, oops, ten is too much,\n\n318\n00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:38.400\nso we're going to go back up and\nthis will give us position one, okay.\n\n319\n00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.560\nSame thing with 14.999 and 15.004, right.\n\n320\n00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:47.060\nSo it's not 15, so\nwe're gonna go back up to position 2.\n\n321\n00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:50.120\nSo it's the closest without going over.\n\n322\n00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:55.470\nAnd I've heard it say it's gonna keep\non running or jumping until it bumps\n\n323\n00:17:55.470 --> 00:18:00.960\ninto the next biggest value,\nand then it's gonna jump back.\n\n324\n00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:06.270\nNow if you think jump back, the direction\nthat you're actually traveling is down.\n\n325\n00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:10.930\nCuz we're saying, it is sorted, so\nyou go down, so then it gets too big and\n\n326\n00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:13.380\nthen you, boop,\nyou gotta jump back up one position.\n\n327\n00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.810\nSo that's what this means.\n\n328\n00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:20.380\nAnd it is not going to do the same thing,\nso\n\n329\n00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:25.370\nwe're gonna go ahead and just select all\nof this and we are going to copy it.\n\n330\n00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:27.820\nI'm going to come into, whoops I\nalways do that, let's go ahead and\n\n331\n00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:32.680\ncome into here, paste it, but\nthen just change this value to a nine.\n\n332\n00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.670\nSo looking for\nthere we will also go ahead and\n\n333\n00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:41.505\nchange out this particular list here.\n\n334\n00:18:41.505 --> 00:18:45.900\nSo same idea but this is text,\nand this time it's just like,\n\n335\n00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.590\nnope, I don't understand.\n\n336\n00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:53.320\nThe other one, it did give us results but\nit didn't really get it.\n\n337\n00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:57.804\nSo it's like, [SOUND] no,\nI don't understand what's going on here.\n\n338\n00:18:57.804 --> 00:19:02.709\nSo again, varying result as what\nit's gonna do with text when you\n\n339\n00:19:02.709 --> 00:19:05.930\nput that match type of one or\nnegative one.\n\n340\n00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.510\nJust a little weird.\n\n341\n00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:09.470\nQuestion there?\n\n342\n00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:12.202\n&gt;&gt; I would say,\nI would probably still stick with zero.\n\n343\n00:19:12.202 --> 00:19:13.809\nBut if we take that horizontal range,\n\n344\n00:19:13.809 --> 00:19:15.830\nbecause that's actually\nnot what I expected.\n\n345\n00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:18.020\nI expect it to give me numbers,\nbut maybe it'd be weird.\n\n346\n00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:21.217\nBut it gives me not available.\n\n347\n00:19:21.217 --> 00:19:25.430\nWhat if we alphabetize left to right?\n\n348\n00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:27.440\nDoes that change those results?\n\n349\n00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.290\nAnd mainly the only reason I want to\nknow is what to keep a look out for\n\n350\n00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:32.700\nif I get weird stuff.\n\n351\n00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:36.720\n&gt;&gt; I just realized, I don't know,\nI can't sort this way.\n\n352\n00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.310\n&gt;&gt; Ahh.\n\n353\n00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:39.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can't sort horizontally.\n\n354\n00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:43.400\nSo I'd have to do some\nchanging of the stuff, so.\n\n355\n00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.390\nI mean we can,\n\n356\n00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:52.070\nwell we can change this to Albert,\nand this to Whoopie.\n\n357\n00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:57.689\n&gt;&gt; And now they're all one.\n\n358\n00:19:57.689 --> 00:19:59.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n359\n00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:00.720\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] So-\n&gt;&gt; Well but this is also w.\n\n360\n00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n361\n00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:06.040\n&gt;&gt; So if I name this Bob.\n\n362\n00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:13.047\nYou see, it's trying but it's,\ncuz now when it goes to Bob, cuz A,\n\n363\n00:20:13.047 --> 00:20:17.258\nB, okay,\nwell now it's number two cuz now this is,\n\n364\n00:20:17.258 --> 00:20:20.750\nwell you know what,\nwhy don't we keep on going?\n\n365\n00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:26.205\nWhat if we did cat,\na dog named cat, it's still five.\n\n366\n00:20:26.205 --> 00:20:29.160\nSo you see how it's not, it's not working.\n\n367\n00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.710\n[LAUGH] I know you're trying,\n\n368\n00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:34.300\nI don't think it's-\n&gt;&gt; No no, I mean this is actually\n\n369\n00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:38.560\nmy point is to try to figure out\nwhat should I be on the lookout for.\n\n370\n00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:42.240\nBecause if it has NA, I'm like, okay,\nyeah that's right, I can't do that.\n\n371\n00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:46.090\nBut if it gives me numbers,\nI might go, yeah, that works.\n\n372\n00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:46.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n373\n00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:48.060\n&gt;&gt; The five see.\n\n374\n00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.940\n&gt;&gt; Well, why don't we stay with that,\nbecause right here,\n\n375\n00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:52.230\nthis is not sorted, correct?\n\n376\n00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:57.520\nRight, it's 50, 30, 10, 20, 40.\nWon't tell me what the position is.\n\n377\n00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.210\nLet's go ahead and do the same thing.\n\n378\n00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:06.223\nLet's match the position for here,\ncomma to this range, F4, comma one, right.\n\n379\n00:21:06.223 --> 00:21:09.889\nSo we're gonna go ahead and do the one,\n\n380\n00:21:09.889 --> 00:21:14.010\nbecause we're not to the negative one yet.\n\n381\n00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:16.530\nThat's correct.\n\n382\n00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:19.720\nSo if I pull this down, well where is 20?\n\n383\n00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.110\nI say 1, 2, 3, 4, but where's 30?\n\n384\n00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.750\nFour?\n\n385\n00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:24.290\nWhere's 15?\n\n386\n00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:24.790\nThree?\n\n387\n00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:33.590\nIt doesn't understand if it's not\nsorted properly with that number one.\n\n388\n00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.157\n&gt;&gt; How do they get five at the end?\n\n389\n00:21:36.157 --> 00:21:38.890\nYou may not know.\n\n390\n00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:41.108\n&gt;&gt; Did I misunderstand?\n\n391\n00:21:41.108 --> 00:21:41.930\n&gt;&gt; It's not right.\n\n392\n00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:43.770\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; We did one which should be\n\n393\n00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:44.700\ntop to bottom, right?\n\n394\n00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:46.540\n&gt;&gt; I just realized that,\nyeah, that should be one.\n\n395\n00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:47.040\nIt's wrong.\n\n396\n00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.960\nIt does not like it if it is not sorted.\n\n397\n00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:55.045\nThat's the biggest thing to understand,\nif it's not sorted.\n\n398\n00:21:55.045 --> 00:21:58.300\nCuz now if I take this and\nthen we go ahead and sort this.\n\n399\n00:22:00.874 --> 00:22:05.365\nIt still didn't work, cause that's-\n&gt;&gt; Well now it's in the right position.\n\n400\n00:22:05.365 --> 00:22:09.720\n&gt;&gt; Wait, I'm sorry, it's 50\n&gt;&gt; I was like no, no it's right\n\n401\n00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:10.501\n&gt;&gt; No, that's right, that's right, and\n\n402\n00:22:10.501 --> 00:22:11.246\nI'm like, yeah, it should be right.\n\n403\n00:22:11.246 --> 00:22:13.220\nI'm like, okay, [SOUND].\n\n404\n00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:16.762\nMoral of the story,\nmake sure you have it sorted, and\n\n405\n00:22:16.762 --> 00:22:22.000\nthen you can use your ones, or negative\nones if it's in the other direction.\n\n406\n00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:22.820\nSo, yeah.\n\n407\n00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:25.160\nI just got confused,\nI still thought 50 was on the top.\n\n408\n00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:30.600\n[LAUGH] We are really,\nreally pushing the limits of this one,\n\n409\n00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.120\nwhich is what Justin always does,\nwhich is good cuz\n\n410\n00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:38.600\nit makes us learn a little bit more of,\nno, you can definitely not do that.\n\n411\n00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.710\nOr sometimes we're like,\nwell yes you can, there you go.\n\n412\n00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:45.980\nSame idea,\nI think you guys got the idea now.\n\n413\n00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:51.410\nInstead of one, we do a negative one\nbecause now it's going the other way.\n\n414\n00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:54.994\nSo if I did the same thing,\nwe will do it one more time.\n\n415\n00:22:54.994 --> 00:22:59.740\nWe'll take that, go ahead and\nselect this range, F4.\n\n416\n00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:04.110\nIt is now going to be a negative one,\nokay.\n\n417\n00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:09.950\nAnd so you can see that number\n10 is in the 8th position, and\n\n418\n00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:14.210\nthen if I pull this on down 15 isn't a 7,\n45 is 144 is 1 as well,\n\n419\n00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:21.440\nbecause then it's like,\nwait, no, that's too small.\n\n420\n00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:25.733\nWe've gotta go back up,\ncuz now we're doing descending order,\n\n421\n00:23:25.733 --> 00:23:29.493\nwe're doing negative, so\nyou're going the other way.\n\n422\n00:23:29.493 --> 00:23:34.365\nAnd so same idea here, the negative\none on this is still just giving\n\n423\n00:23:34.365 --> 00:23:37.590\nus some strange results with the text.\n\n424\n00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:42.737\nAnd then an unsorted list is going\nto do the same thing of giving you\n\n425\n00:23:42.737 --> 00:23:47.619\nsome strange results for\nwhen you go ahead and give it a match.\n\n426\n00:23:47.619 --> 00:23:52.619\nSo that's what it does,\nmatch will go ahead and\n\n427\n00:23:52.619 --> 00:23:59.250\nreturn the position of a value\nthat you specify within a range.\n\n428\n00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:04.210\nJust remembering those match types And\nthen what you need to do if you are using\n\n429\n00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:08.950\na match type that is not exact\nof how to sort your information.\n\n430\n00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:12.900\nIf you're thinking,\nwhat's this gonna do for me, like,\n\n431\n00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:18.020\nokay it's gonna tell me this is third\nin the position, sure, all right.\n\n432\n00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:22.210\nYou're gonna have to combine it\nwith some other functions for\n\n433\n00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:28.680\nyou to kinda think like, that's when and\nwhere I would actually use that.\n\n434\n00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.968\nBut that is coming up in the next episode.\n\n435\n00:24:31.968 --> 00:24:33.400\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne,\nnow before we get out of here,\n\n436\n00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:37.420\nI actually thought of one final thing\nto see if we can smack it and break it.\n\n437\n00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:40.089\nIf we go back to values of box a,\nthat tab, so we used one,\n\n438\n00:24:40.089 --> 00:24:42.494\nwhich assumes that the date\nis in ascending order.\n\n439\n00:24:42.494 --> 00:24:46.170\nAnd we showed that ascending order works\nbest, it actually works correctly.\n\n440\n00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:51.429\nWhat if we go to, we can just go\nto the 10, 15, 9, 14, 9, 9, 9.\n\n441\n00:24:51.429 --> 00:24:54.310\nWhat if we change that to\na negative one telling it\n\n442\n00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:59.782\nthe opposite way what\nresults do we have there?\n\n443\n00:24:59.782 --> 00:25:05.950\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha, okay, so I change the sort\norder or the match order to -1.\n\n444\n00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:12.250\nIt doesn't understand, and then if I\ndo here, it just doesn't understand.\n\n445\n00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:14.770\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that actually works for me.\n\n446\n00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:18.415\nI like that better than it going,\nsome stuff, here's a number.\n\n447\n00:25:18.415 --> 00:25:20.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz if you get a number,\n\n448\n00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:22.090\nif it tells you N/A,\n\n449\n00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:25.870\nwe talked about this earlier in the\nepisode, you go, that's not gonna work.\n\n450\n00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:28.392\nIf it gives you numbers,\nyou go, I don't know.\n\n451\n00:25:28.392 --> 00:25:30.920\nAll right, I guess that works.\n\n452\n00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:34.390\n&gt;&gt; It would be super misleading,\nand you might think, especially\n\n453\n00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:37.880\nif you're looking at a huge range of\nstuff, you're not gonna go through.\n\n454\n00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:42.604\nWhen we have five values or\nnine values, yeah, we can see,\n\n455\n00:25:42.604 --> 00:25:45.190\nhm, that's broken, right?\n\n456\n00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:48.395\nBut if you're just relying on it,\nbe like, yeah,\n\n457\n00:25:48.395 --> 00:25:52.610\nwell, it's gonna tell me the position,\nbe careful about that.\n\n458\n00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:54.911\nThat's a really good point to make.\n\n459\n00:25:54.911 --> 00:25:59.410\nYou really need to understand what those,\nthe zeroes, the ones, and\n\n460\n00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:00.935\nthe negative ones, and\n\n461\n00:26:00.935 --> 00:26:05.369\nhow how your data must be to have that\nreact the way that you intend it.\n\n462\n00:26:05.369 --> 00:26:09.387\nCuz otherwise, it shows you like,\nyep, I got you an answer,\n\n463\n00:26:09.387 --> 00:26:11.730\n[LAUGH] but it's not right.\n\n464\n00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:13.580\nThat could lead to all sorts of problems.\n\n465\n00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:16.939\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can think of all the times\nthat I started searching for\n\n466\n00:26:16.939 --> 00:26:19.100\nwhy I have that value error.\n\n467\n00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.640\nCuz I used pre-computed\nvalues somewhere else,\n\n468\n00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:24.520\ncombine it with another function,\nand then things go horribly awry.\n\n469\n00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:28.150\nSo hopefully that doesn't happen to you,\nand hopefully you'll come on back and\n\n470\n00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:29.570\njoin us for more OfficePro.\n\n471\n00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:31.770\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n472\n00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:34.047\nSigning off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n473\n00:26:34.047 --> 00:26:35.075\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n474\n00:26:35.075 --> 00:26:35.920\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n475\n00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.969\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:15.312\nexciting episode of OfficeProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.312 --> 00:00:18.298\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison, and well,\n\n5\n00:00:18.298 --> 00:00:22.756\nyou should be glad you're back\nbecause we got more Excel functions.\n\n6\n00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:23.910\nWhat function are we talking about?\n\n7\n00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.240\nThe index function.\n\n8\n00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.100\nDraped in mystery, right?\n\n9\n00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.375\nLuckily we have someone who's gonna pull\nback the curtains and reveal all, Ms.\n\n10\n00:00:31.375 --> 00:00:32.010\nVionne Smith.\n\n11\n00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.250\nHow you doing today, Vonne?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing pretty good.\n\n12\n00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.550\nHow about you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic,\n\n13\n00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.394\nand all I could think about is all\nof the knowledge that may not apply\n\n14\n00:00:40.394 --> 00:00:45.060\n[LAUGH] in this content\nsurrounding the word index.\n\n15\n00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.182\nSo the word is index.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n16\n00:00:47.182 --> 00:00:51.778\ncuz I think I think it means something\na little bit different to us\n\n17\n00:00:51.778 --> 00:00:56.471\noffice people or Excel people than\nyou as a developer and a coder.\n\n18\n00:00:56.471 --> 00:01:02.018\nAnd we've kind of alluded to this fact\na couple of times, actually in our episode\n\n19\n00:01:02.018 --> 00:01:07.170\nabout match, that this actually kind\nof matches up together a little bit.\n\n20\n00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.966\nBut no, not code-wise usually\nhow you think about positioning,\n\n21\n00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:13.390\nsomething about zero length string.\n\n22\n00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.590\nAn index in your brain is the position\nthat something requires, I guess,\n\n23\n00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.958\nor embodies in a particular list.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so before this episode I was,\n\n24\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:29.415\nyeah, indexes, like list indexes, but\nthat's not what we're talking about.\n\n25\n00:01:29.415 --> 00:01:32.060\nTypically in my world\neverything is zero indexes.\n\n26\n00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.590\nThat's not to say,\n\n27\n00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.890\nthat just means you start counting\nfrom zero, that's how I use that word.\n\n28\n00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.712\nSo I may start asking question, Vonne,\n\n29\n00:01:38.712 --> 00:01:41.563\nin this episode where you go\nthat doesn't apply yet, Justin.\n\n30\n00:01:41.563 --> 00:01:44.800\nJust sit over there and think about\nwhat you've said and don't say it again.\n\n31\n00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.530\nSo I'll try not to do that, but\nI'm wondering, are they related?\n\n32\n00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.633\n&gt;&gt; Kind of, in a weird roundabout way,\n\n33\n00:01:54.633 --> 00:01:56.770\nso let's start with an example.\n\n34\n00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.030\nLet's not even worry about what\nthe function does and everything.\n\n35\n00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.146\nI have an example.\n\n36\n00:02:02.146 --> 00:02:05.680\nWe're gonna play a little game,\nLet's Ask Justin, okay?\n\n37\n00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.542\nSo I have a list here of\nthe number of meows per month.\n\n38\n00:02:09.542 --> 00:02:13.870\nOkay, with our cats over here and\nthe months.\n\n39\n00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.816\nSo if I told you just\nin regular normal talk,\n\n40\n00:02:18.816 --> 00:02:23.496\nright, human talk, not computer talk,\n\n41\n00:02:23.496 --> 00:02:30.426\nhow many meows did Fuego do in March?\n&gt;&gt; 229,\n\n42\n00:02:30.426 --> 00:02:32.693\nI think I'm seeing that right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n43\n00:02:32.693 --> 00:02:37.043\nI don't know if you can see far cuz\nthe TVs are a little far away, but\n\n44\n00:02:37.043 --> 00:02:40.091\ntell me the process that\nyou did in your brain.\n\n45\n00:02:40.091 --> 00:02:44.002\nBreak it down as to what did you do first.\n&gt;&gt; So I'm like all right,\n\n46\n00:02:44.002 --> 00:02:46.530\nso Fuego, first I made a cursory glance.\n\n47\n00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.095\nI was like, I need to orientate myself.\n\n48\n00:02:48.095 --> 00:02:50.210\nAre names columns or rows?\n\n49\n00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.520\nAnd then, okay, the columns are months,\nthe rows are labeled with names.\n\n50\n00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.740\nAnd then I was like, all right, well,\nI'm gonna go down through the names and\n\n51\n00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.310\nfind Fuego.\n\n52\n00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.850\nAnd then on that row,\nI'm gonna head over to the columns and\n\n53\n00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.160\nmatch up with the corresponding\nlabeled column of March and\n\n54\n00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.810\njust read out that number.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah,\n\n55\n00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.690\nthat's the index function.\n\n56\n00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.310\nThat is saying, cuz this is part\nof the lookup family of functions,\n\n57\n00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.110\nthat I went ahead and said okay,\nyou said rows and columns perfectly.\n\n58\n00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.090\nSo these are our columns, right?\n\n59\n00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.310\nAnd if I have these as my labels, you went\ndown and went, one, two, three, four.\n\n60\n00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.360\nOkay, so Fuego is the fourth\nposition in the rows, and\n\n61\n00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.730\nthen you went over to one, two, three.\n\n62\n00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.290\nYou went over to the third\ncolumn within this whole\n\n63\n00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.700\ntable of information,\nthis range of data, this array.\n\n64\n00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.315\nSo tables, range, array,\nyou can kind of interchange them all, and\n\n65\n00:03:56.315 --> 00:03:57.858\nwe're just talking normal.\n\n66\n00:03:57.858 --> 00:03:59.819\nAll right, so that's what you do.\n\n67\n00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.830\nRight, and that's exactly what\nthe index function is going to do.\n\n68\n00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.870\nIt is going to retrieve\na value in a range of\n\n69\n00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:17.540\ninformation that you say this many rows\ndown, and this many columns across.\n\n70\n00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.980\nBecause we're not talking about\nthese columns or these rows,\n\n71\n00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.620\nlike in the Excel worksheet.\n\n72\n00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.940\nYou're talking with the relative\nposition within the table.\n\n73\n00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.072\nJanuary is the first column.\n\n74\n00:04:32.072 --> 00:04:37.080\nFebruary's the second, third, fourth,\nthat's what we're talking about here.\n\n75\n00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:43.520\nThis is the data within the table, and\nthat's what we're going to look for.\n\n76\n00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.320\nThere you go.\n\n77\n00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.050\nSo that's why I wanted to ask you,\nwhat did you do, right?\n\n78\n00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.210\nNow the index button is going\nto do the exact same thing.\n\n79\n00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:01.060\nSo that's why I was like kinda like\nwhat indexes in your world but\n\n80\n00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.860\nmaybe not exactly.\n\n81\n00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.430\nIt's what I would call a two-dimensional\nposition because I have a row\n\n82\n00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.035\nand a column.\n\n83\n00:05:07.035 --> 00:05:10.250\nAnd when you're actually\nlooking things up like this,\n\n84\n00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.540\nit doesn't matter whether you go.\n\n85\n00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.470\nI do rows first and then,\nbecause that's how most of us read.\n\n86\n00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.700\nI would tend to say most people\ngo top to bottom, left to right.\n\n87\n00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.710\nThere's nothing that says I\ncan't go to the March column and\n\n88\n00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.740\nthen go to the Fuego row.\n\n89\n00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.970\nThose are okay, but\nwe're talking about a function here.\n\n90\n00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.140\nSo I'm guessing we need to think\nabout it in a particular way.\n\n91\n00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.970\nIs there any way that we need to think\nabout that lookup process to make sure we\n\n92\n00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.788\ndon't switch arguments or get weird stuff.\n&gt;&gt; We just need to follow the directions\n\n93\n00:05:40.788 --> 00:05:43.688\nwithin the function as to this\nis where you put the column and\n\n94\n00:05:43.688 --> 00:05:45.142\nthis is where you put the row.\n\n95\n00:05:45.142 --> 00:05:49.132\nAnd that's what you really got to\nkeep it straight in your brain, too,\n\n96\n00:05:49.132 --> 00:05:51.250\nas to which one is which.\n\n97\n00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.900\nIt can flip depending on\nhow your data is sorted or\n\n98\n00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.200\nnot sorted, arranged and\nwhere you're trying to put the results,\n\n99\n00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.290\nthat might be where you, just be\na little careful about what goes where.\n\n100\n00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:09.320\nThat being said, let me jump down into\nthe documentation for the index function.\n\n101\n00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.980\nSo here it says,\nthe index function returns a value, or\n\n102\n00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.267\nthe reference to a value from\nwithin a table or range.\n\n103\n00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.790\nJust go okay for a minute.\n\n104\n00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.230\nNow the thing is,\n\n105\n00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:28.990\nthis particular function actually has\ntwo different ways that you can use it.\n\n106\n00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:34.460\nThe syntax that you can\nuse does vary slightly.\n\n107\n00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.970\nAnd this is where I'm like, wait,\nso is it two different functions?\n\n108\n00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:38.810\nNo, it's not two different functions,\nokay?\n\n109\n00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.380\nIt's the same thing.\n\n110\n00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.256\nIt's just whether or\nnot you use a fourth element or\n\n111\n00:06:45.256 --> 00:06:48.080\nfourth argument within the function.\n\n112\n00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.700\nAnd if you use that fourth argument,\n\n113\n00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.825\nit depends on how your\nfirst argument is set up.\n\n114\n00:06:55.825 --> 00:06:58.154\n[SOUND] Examples to come.\n\n115\n00:06:58.154 --> 00:07:02.679\nSo it will be there, but\nI just wanted to let you know that there\n\n116\n00:07:02.679 --> 00:07:07.830\nare going to be two different choices or\nvariations on this function.\n\n117\n00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:12.480\nAnd at first, it's gonna seem\nlike there's no difference, but\n\n118\n00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:17.860\nwhen you get into specific examples\nof when it does get different,\n\n119\n00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.075\nthen that's when they get different.\n\n120\n00:07:20.075 --> 00:07:25.414\n[LAUGH] Little strange,\nokay, just prepping you now.\n\n121\n00:07:25.414 --> 00:07:28.106\nBut hopefully, through these examples,\nyou'll see when and\n\n122\n00:07:28.106 --> 00:07:29.898\nwhere this is going to make a difference.\n\n123\n00:07:29.898 --> 00:07:34.112\nOkay, so let's just start\nwith the same variations, but\n\n124\n00:07:34.112 --> 00:07:37.040\nthey're gonna end up looking the same.\n\n125\n00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.150\nLet's just go.\n\n126\n00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:44.865\nI'm gonna return the results of Pumpkin\nfor March, so let's just go ahead and\n\n127\n00:07:44.865 --> 00:07:46.230\nget that in our brain.\n\n128\n00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.100\nWe went one, two, three.\n\n129\n00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:51.930\nSo Pumpkin is the third cat within\nthis table, so one, two, three.\n\n130\n00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:56.265\nAnd then we need March,\nwhich is one, two, three, so\n\n131\n00:07:56.265 --> 00:07:59.206\nit's the third row, third column.\n\n132\n00:07:59.206 --> 00:08:03.830\nWe should get 302, that's going to\nbe our result, so let's look at it.\n\n133\n00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.860\nLet's get our cursor in\nthe cell that we want, or\n\n134\n00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:12.030\nselect the cell, insert function\ndialog box, we are going to the index.\n\n135\n00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:16.890\nWe click OK, and\nnotice that right away it's like hey\n\n136\n00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:21.350\nit has different things that you\ncan do here, which one do you want?\n\n137\n00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:25.770\nDo you want to use the array,\nrow number and column number?\n\n138\n00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:29.420\nOr do you wanna use the reference and\nthen row number and column number and\n\n139\n00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:30.330\nthen area number?\n\n140\n00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:32.916\nMmm, first one?\n\n141\n00:08:32.916 --> 00:08:34.158\nThat's fine, okay.\n\n142\n00:08:34.158 --> 00:08:38.060\nSo let's just go ahead and click the first\none and then see what it wants us to do.\n\n143\n00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:44.850\nThe array is the range of cells or\nan array constant.\n\n144\n00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:47.670\nIt's just your table, it's your range.\n\n145\n00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:50.500\nIt's your array,\nit's the thing that you're looking at.\n\n146\n00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:55.380\nThe biggest thing that you do need to know\nabout this particular one is you do not,\n\n147\n00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.570\nthis is wrong.\n\n148\n00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:04.170\nThat is not correct, you do not take\nthe headings or the labels with it.\n\n149\n00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:07.573\nYou need to just do the data itself.\n\n150\n00:09:07.573 --> 00:09:12.140\nYou want this,\nthat's what you need to select.\n\n151\n00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:13.310\nSo be careful about that.\n\n152\n00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.270\nNow you're going to do the row number.\n\n153\n00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:18.840\nCuz you asked, well which way does it go?\n\n154\n00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.885\nWell in this case,\nRow is first, then column okay?\n\n155\n00:09:22.885 --> 00:09:28.195\nSo that's in the function you do have\nto abide by what it's asking for.\n\n156\n00:09:28.195 --> 00:09:33.395\nSo we said that the row number was one,\ntwo, three, physically type in three.\n\n157\n00:09:33.395 --> 00:09:38.515\nAnd the column number was one,\ntwo, three, March, three.\n\n158\n00:09:39.665 --> 00:09:43.680\nYou can see it's already returning\na result and that's exactly what it does.\n\n159\n00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.360\nThat is the index function.\n\n160\n00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.330\nOkay, we're not gonna stop there because\nwe have a lot more explanations to go with\n\n161\n00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.960\nand different examples to\nreally drive this home.\n\n162\n00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.150\nSo that's what I would do.\n\n163\n00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:00.492\nI see Justin's look, but I just keep\nit for one second, he's [LAUGH].\n\n164\n00:10:00.492 --> 00:10:03.396\n&gt;&gt; I know there's a lot to unpack here, so\n\n165\n00:10:03.396 --> 00:10:05.420\nI'm gonna sit over here and\n\n166\n00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.193\njust pull my lips tightly together.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n167\n00:10:08.193 --> 00:10:09.561\n&gt;&gt; I'll just be like, mm-hm, mm-hm.\n\n168\n00:10:09.561 --> 00:10:10.649\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n169\n00:10:10.649 --> 00:10:11.417\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n170\n00:10:11.417 --> 00:10:12.165\n&gt;&gt; Get that little lean\n\n171\n00:10:12.165 --> 00:10:12.785\ngoing [CROSSTALK]\n\n172\n00:10:12.785 --> 00:10:13.569\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That you got there.\n\n173\n00:10:13.569 --> 00:10:17.260\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna get my hard contemplative\n\n174\n00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:21.100\nlean.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So this is where I, and\n\n175\n00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.820\nespecially if you're thinking well\nwhat if I wanted to change this to\n\n176\n00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:24.718\nZinger for February?\n\n177\n00:10:24.718 --> 00:10:27.840\nI'm not gonna copy it down,\nI'm just going to change it right here.\n\n178\n00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:32.620\nZinger is one, two, three, four,\nfive and then February is one, two.\n\n179\n00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:37.880\nSo I would come into here and\nchange this from three to\n\n180\n00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.920\nfive and then zinger, that's zinger.\n\n181\n00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:47.050\nThen February would be two, and\nit gives me 321, that's the right one.\n\n182\n00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:49.030\nBut notice, it seems very manual.\n\n183\n00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:52.030\nI don't have to go in there and\nactually change the numbers, right?\n\n184\n00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:55.790\nThat doesn't seem,\nI know, hold the thought,\n\n185\n00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:59.250\nwe'll come back around with a match and\nit'll make it a little bit more dynamic.\n\n186\n00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:00.990\nThese two functions, match and index,\n\n187\n00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:06.430\nreally do come together you usually\nsee them explained together as well.\n\n188\n00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:12.659\nWell now that other variation so\nlet's just do the Zinger one as well.\n\n189\n00:11:12.659 --> 00:11:16.480\nSo Zinger February right, because\nthere was two different variations.\n\n190\n00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.260\nLet's look at it, so I'm going to\nuse it index, let's just go for\n\n191\n00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.900\nthe second one for fun.\n\n192\n00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.190\nWe'll click OK.\n\n193\n00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:29.560\nNow it's using the reference, but\nnotice the definition right here.\n\n194\n00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:34.300\nIt's a reference to one or more ranges.\n\n195\n00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.750\nOkay, keep that in the back\nof your mind for right now.\n\n196\n00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:41.313\nBut for now, it just says I can use one so\nI'm going to do the same thing.\n\n197\n00:11:41.313 --> 00:11:45.457\nI'm gonna select here the range, array,\n\n198\n00:11:45.457 --> 00:11:50.170\ntable whatever,\nthe row number, same thing.\n\n199\n00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:53.915\nI need to go down, we're doing\nZinger in February so that's five,\n\n200\n00:11:53.915 --> 00:11:56.492\nthe column is still two\nthat hasn't changed.\n\n201\n00:11:56.492 --> 00:12:01.103\nAnd then it says area number, and\nit says well select a range and\n\n202\n00:12:01.103 --> 00:12:04.061\nreference from which to return a value.\n\n203\n00:12:04.061 --> 00:12:06.210\nThat doesn't make any sense.\n\n204\n00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:09.720\nThe first area selected or\nentered is area one.\n\n205\n00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:13.870\nThe second area is area two and so on.\n\n206\n00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:17.020\nWell I only have one, so\nit doesn't matter, right now.\n\n207\n00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:21.730\nI'll come back around to where this will\nmake more sense as to where this would\n\n208\n00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:23.290\nmean something.\n\n209\n00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:24.330\nFor now, you know what I'm gonna do?\n\n210\n00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:25.540\nI'm just gonna ignore it.\n\n211\n00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.040\nI'm gonna be like,\nI'm not gonna put anything.\n\n212\n00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:31.990\nAnd I click OK, and it gives me the exact\nsame thing, no syntax difference.\n\n213\n00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:32.520\nLook it here.\n\n214\n00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:38.370\nSo if I click on this cell right there,\nclick on this cell, same thing.\n\n215\n00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:41.230\nSo why did it take me two\ndifferent places if it's gonna\n\n216\n00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:43.540\nend up looking the exact same?\n\n217\n00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:48.570\nFor this example,\nthere are no variations, okay?\n\n218\n00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:52.420\nSo again, don't think of it as two\nseparate functions, it's just how you're\n\n219\n00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:58.140\ngoing to treat it depending on what\ninformation you're looking at.\n\n220\n00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:00.520\nOkay, questions?\n&gt;&gt; Okay so\n\n221\n00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.350\nI'm guessing it behaves in\na particular way based on whether\n\n222\n00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:05.910\nit has three arguments, or\nwhether it has four arguments.\n\n223\n00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:11.180\nThis is something that I've seen\ncalled polymorphic to some extent.\n\n224\n00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:14.840\nThey've changed the form that\nthey take on based on something.\n\n225\n00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.690\nYou have four arguments, then it's\ngonna behave a little bit differently.\n\n226\n00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:22.842\nSo really we get to say index,\nyou give it a range, or something, comma,\n\n227\n00:13:22.842 --> 00:13:27.530\nrow comma, column and you're good to go.\n&gt;&gt; Done, correct.\n\n228\n00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:29.425\nBut when you go over to\nsomething like this.\n\n229\n00:13:29.425 --> 00:13:33.347\n[LAUGH] Justin just rubbed his face.\n\n230\n00:13:33.347 --> 00:13:36.106\nIt's like, wait, exactly.\n\n231\n00:13:36.106 --> 00:13:38.750\nRight, this is where we can get a little.\n\n232\n00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:42.119\nAll right,\nwe're adding in another element.\n\n233\n00:13:42.119 --> 00:13:45.043\nWe could call these tables, one, two,\n\n234\n00:13:45.043 --> 00:13:50.377\nbased on what those little red numbers\nare underneath it, three, four.\n\n235\n00:13:50.377 --> 00:13:54.144\nSo we have, what do we have,\nmeow, swipes, naps, and treats,\n\n236\n00:13:54.144 --> 00:13:56.150\njust making stuff up, okay?\n\n237\n00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:57.350\nAnd just to remind us,\n\n238\n00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:02.420\nright here, if we did the pumpkin in\nMarch, this is the same thing, right?\n\n239\n00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:06.150\nThere's nothing funky going on, just the\ncolumn reference and the row reference,\n\n240\n00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:07.920\njust like you said, okay.\n\n241\n00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:12.070\nBut that's only when I'm using one array,\nor one table.\n\n242\n00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:16.310\nWhen I want to do, all right,\nwell now let's go ahead and\n\n243\n00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:22.110\nbring in all of our tables, this is where\nit's gonna make a difference, okay?\n\n244\n00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:28.160\nAnd you're gonna need to use\nthe reference one, not the array one.\n\n245\n00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.130\nLet me show you.\n\n246\n00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:34.250\nGot my cell selected,\nwe'll insert the function.\n\n247\n00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:39.780\nWe're going to use the second one\nbecause now, in this reference,\n\n248\n00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:46.160\nwhat that means is I'm going to select\nmultiple ranges of information.\n\n249\n00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:51.210\nAnd the order in which I select\nthem determines what is one,\n\n250\n00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:53.190\nwhat is two, what is three,\nand what is four.\n\n251\n00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:55.690\nI'm going one, two, three, four.\n\n252\n00:14:55.690 --> 00:15:03.080\nBut if you went, one, two, three, four,\nthat's fine, it doesn't matter your order.\n\n253\n00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:08.090\nWhat matters is the number that you're\ngoing to put in that fourth position\n\n254\n00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:11.900\nwhere you remember what is one,\nwhat is two, what is three,\n\n255\n00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.880\nwhat is four.\n&gt;&gt; So Vonne, I would have to tell you,\n\n256\n00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:18.530\nif I were doing this, I would\nprobably whip out a sheet of paper.\n\n257\n00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:20.700\nEven if I wasn't labeling them like that,\nI would go all right, so\n\n258\n00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:24.250\nthis is my convention\nbecause I need to know this.\n\n259\n00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:28.190\nCuz as much as you empasize that, it seems\nlike that might be a source of a whole\n\n260\n00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:31.150\nbunch of bad.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] yeah.\n\n261\n00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:36.050\nBecause it's still, if you had four\ntables and you say give me the one\n\n262\n00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:40.320\nfrom the fourth one but\nyou selected that in a weird order, or\n\n263\n00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:44.940\nthe second one, you selected it weird,\nthere's still something in position two.\n\n264\n00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:48.792\nIt just might not be the one that you\nthought you selected the position two.\n\n265\n00:15:48.792 --> 00:15:50.373\nI feel like, show me!\n\n266\n00:15:50.373 --> 00:15:52.920\nI will, let's click OK.\n\n267\n00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:56.299\nAnd there's going to be another gotcha,\nso hold on.\n\n268\n00:15:56.299 --> 00:15:58.090\nSo what are my references?\n\n269\n00:15:58.090 --> 00:15:59.611\nFirst one, cool.\n\n270\n00:15:59.611 --> 00:16:02.730\nHold the control key, or\ncommand key if you're on a Mac.\n\n271\n00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:06.050\nI'm gonna move this over here,\nfor just a little bit, okay.\n\n272\n00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:08.730\nHold the control, select this one.\n\n273\n00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:15.691\nNotice how right there, you see how\nit's putting arrange, arrange and\n\n274\n00:16:15.691 --> 00:16:21.170\nthen it'll put another comma but\nthat's remember one,\n\n275\n00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:26.782\ntwo and then if I come out old\ncontrol three, four, okay?\n\n276\n00:16:26.782 --> 00:16:30.240\nSo I selected it in that order.\n\n277\n00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:36.050\nB, H, D, H, okay?\n\n278\n00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:37.480\nWhat am I looking for?\n\n279\n00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.287\nRight now I'm just doing fuego and\nMarch, okay.\n\n280\n00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:44.590\nFuego, March,\nkeep me in check there, Justin.\n\n281\n00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:47.220\nFuego is one, two, three, four.\n\n282\n00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:52.770\nThe column March is one, two, three, okay?\n\n283\n00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:55.630\nIt's a little bit different here.\n\n284\n00:16:55.630 --> 00:17:00.360\nCool, so now I want to find this in,\nI'm gonna find the meows first.\n\n285\n00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:05.050\nWe're gonna say, this is where,\nwhich area number, I suppose in the red,\n\n286\n00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:06.570\nthat's area number one.\n\n287\n00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:11.170\nNow, you already see something but\nit like [SOUND] something's wrong.\n\n288\n00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:13.610\nI know, but give me a second.\n\n289\n00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:16.260\nI click OK, it's gonna tell you,\nyou did this wrong.\n\n290\n00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.890\nAnd like, well, why?\n\n291\n00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:19.610\nI did exactly?\n\n292\n00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:21.569\nIt says you've entered too many arguments.\n\n293\n00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:24.740\nI don't understand.\n\n294\n00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:28.345\nThis is where the insert function\ndialog box actually fails you, okay?\n\n295\n00:17:28.345 --> 00:17:30.467\n[LAUGH] Which you're like why?\n\n296\n00:17:30.467 --> 00:17:33.280\nRemember how it's supposed to\ndo all this syntax for you?\n\n297\n00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.990\nRight, I think you found it Justin.\n\n298\n00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:39.420\nThis is all one argument.\n\n299\n00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.103\nHow am I going to treat it?\n\n300\n00:17:41.103 --> 00:17:42.490\nI'm gonna call on you Justin.\n\n301\n00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:44.790\nHow am I going to treat\nit as one argument?\n\n302\n00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.180\n&gt;&gt; Parentheses?\n\n303\n00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:51.324\nShould I use upward-inflectionally?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n304\n00:17:51.324 --> 00:17:54.560\n&gt;&gt; I think you should [LAUGH].\n\n305\n00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:56.504\n&gt;&gt; So that's where you need to put all of\n\n306\n00:17:56.504 --> 00:18:00.990\nthis, and I'm using my arrow key just\nto make sure I get in the right place.\n\n307\n00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:05.480\nThere, this is your reference.\n\n308\n00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.780\nAnd then this is your column, row, and\n\n309\n00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:12.881\nthen which table or\narea that you have selected.\n\n310\n00:18:12.881 --> 00:18:14.460\nThat's why 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n311\n00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:18.230\nYou see how the order?\n\n312\n00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:23.670\nThat's why this argument\ndepends on this argument of how\n\n313\n00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:27.938\nyou selected it and\nthe order in which you selected it.\n\n314\n00:18:27.938 --> 00:18:33.263\n[SOUND] All right,\nhit Enter, and that did it.\n\n315\n00:18:33.263 --> 00:18:37.270\n[LAUGH] I know, it's like, sometimes you\nfeel like you're running a marathon when\n\n316\n00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:39.880\nyou're doing these functions and\neverything.\n\n317\n00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.240\n&gt;&gt; So the whole time you're talking,\n\n318\n00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:45.085\nI'm trying to build a mental model that\nwould help me, kind of keep me straight.\n\n319\n00:18:45.085 --> 00:18:46.520\nSo I'm kind of looking at this and\n\n320\n00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:52.400\nseeing these four tables as four\ndifferent sheets of paper, in a folder.\n\n321\n00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:55.210\nAnd then what order they\nare in front to back.\n\n322\n00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:57.350\nIs the 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n323\n00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:59.900\nAnd so as a collection they're\nin that folder, right?\n\n324\n00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.570\nThat's our first argument.\n\n325\n00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:02.890\nAnd then you go, you know what?\n\n326\n00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:06.616\nI need to look on the third column,\nfourth row of it,\n\n327\n00:19:06.616 --> 00:19:11.120\nthose two arguments and\nthen which one it's in the page three.\n\n328\n00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:15.006\nFlip, flip, flip, third row,\nfourth column, pow, there it is.\n\n329\n00:19:15.006 --> 00:19:18.823\nIt's kind of like, how you would look\nup a complex reporting schedule or\n\n330\n00:19:18.823 --> 00:19:23.480\nsomething like that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and if I wanted to now return\n\n331\n00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:27.850\nthe number of swipes,\nI'd come into here for Fuego.\n\n332\n00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:33.420\nI would change this 1 to 2,\nand it should result in 4,\n\n333\n00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:37.870\nbecause Fuego, March 4th,\nin the second area.\n\n334\n00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:43.540\nOkay, and the same thing,\nif I change it over to number 3,\n\n335\n00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:48.940\nthen that would make that 241,\nwhich is correct.\n\n336\n00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:52.610\nSo, and that's if I want to change\nthe cats, then I change the column.\n\n337\n00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:54.790\nNo, sorry,\nrow reference if I wanna change the month,\n\n338\n00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:59.295\nI change the column reference, in which\ntable I would have to change the area.\n\n339\n00:19:59.295 --> 00:20:03.855\n[SOUND] Yeah, and again,\nlittle manual going on.\n\n340\n00:20:03.855 --> 00:20:06.210\nLike, I don't wanna have to go in and\nchange the numbers.\n\n341\n00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:08.880\nWe'll come back around as to how\nyou can make that more dynamic.\n\n342\n00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:15.960\nBut that is how you would use\nthe reference option of this particular\n\n343\n00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:20.970\nfunction, and using that fourth argument.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n344\n00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:25.620\nVonne, speaking of my mental model, I was\nthinking, what if you had 10,000 of these?\n\n345\n00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.330\nYou're not gonna put them all\non the same worksheet, right?\n\n346\n00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:30.430\nIf you had giant reports.\n\n347\n00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:33.578\nNot saying that you have to show us,\nbecause I think it's just add,\n\n348\n00:20:33.578 --> 00:20:34.474\nrinse and repeat.\n\n349\n00:20:34.474 --> 00:20:39.060\nI could do this route across sheets,\nright?\n\n350\n00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:40.940\nAnd say look at all of these.\n\n351\n00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:44.631\nAnd if they're all alphabetized, and\nwith the same header rows and stuff.\n\n352\n00:20:44.631 --> 00:20:50.175\nThen, that way I can look at specific\nsheets with that final argument.\n\n353\n00:20:50.175 --> 00:20:51.235\n&gt;&gt; I mean you could.\n\n354\n00:20:51.235 --> 00:20:54.686\nThere's nothing wrong with it\nbecause this right here as a,\n\n355\n00:20:54.686 --> 00:20:56.994\nwe're just gonna call it a table again.\n\n356\n00:20:56.994 --> 00:21:01.166\nI'm just using the range but if you put\nlike the sheet name in front of it and\n\n357\n00:21:01.166 --> 00:21:05.160\nput that all the single quotes and\neverything you can totally do that.\n\n358\n00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:09.440\nSo that's just like any formular of\nfunction you can reference other places\n\n359\n00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:17.270\nit's just what is name if you want to\nsay of that particular spot, okay.\n\n360\n00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:20.850\nThis is just using relatively in\nthis worksheet use these cells.\n\n361\n00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:24.160\nIf it was a separate worksheet, you would\nuse the sheet name in front of that.\n\n362\n00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.140\n&gt;&gt; And the order for that last argument,\n\n363\n00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:29.080\nwhether it's one, two, three,\nfour would be based on the order that you\n\n364\n00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:33.210\nput them in, with sheet names or\nnot, in that first part, right?\n\n365\n00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:38.141\nYes, so you could, the sheets\nmay not be in the same order but\n\n366\n00:21:38.141 --> 00:21:42.784\nhow you selected them in\nthe function that is that is key,\n\n367\n00:21:42.784 --> 00:21:45.818\nyes, very good point there Justin.\n\n368\n00:21:45.818 --> 00:21:46.920\nAll right, that's it.\n\n369\n00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.605\nAll right, you ready for the next one?\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if I am or not, honestly.\n\n370\n00:21:49.605 --> 00:21:50.457\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n371\n00:21:50.457 --> 00:21:52.460\n&gt;&gt; There's some shenanigans around here.\n\n372\n00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:54.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It take a little bit for\n\n373\n00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:57.100\nit to kind of [SOUND] like get in there.\n\n374\n00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:04.212\nNow this is gonna go off on\na slight tangent for a minute,\n\n375\n00:22:04.212 --> 00:22:11.002\nand we're gonna talk about arrays\nas actual array functions.\n\n376\n00:22:11.002 --> 00:22:15.118\nI'm gonna leave this to\na little lofty out there,\n\n377\n00:22:15.118 --> 00:22:20.998\nbecause array functions by themselves,\nthey mean something, okay.\n\n378\n00:22:20.998 --> 00:22:22.870\nHow you can actually\nperform an array function?\n\n379\n00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:28.030\nMeaning actual array calculation it takes\nthat you have to not just hit Enter,\n\n380\n00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:30.640\nyou have to hit Ctrl+Shift+Enter.\n\n381\n00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:35.780\nI'm gonna do this for you here, with just\na little kind of like, you'll have to\n\n382\n00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:40.040\nwatch the array functions episodes to\nreally understand what this means.\n\n383\n00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:43.380\nFor now, you're just gonna have to like\nsay, this is how this particular function\n\n384\n00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:45.630\nworks, within this particular option,\nokay.\n\n385\n00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:49.060\nI'm just prefacing that right now, okay.\n\n386\n00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:49.560\nHere we go.\n\n387\n00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:55.580\nWhen we talk about,\nin this particular option Fuego and March.\n\n388\n00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:57.310\nThat was just from the last bar sheet.\n\n389\n00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:59.060\nJust remind us, same idea.\n\n390\n00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:01.458\nRight, we did the comma, or I'm sorry,\n\n391\n00:23:01.458 --> 00:23:06.061\nthe parenthesis around that first argument\nto understand and then the column.\n\n392\n00:23:06.061 --> 00:23:10.941\nThe row, the column and\nthen the area number, okay.\n\n393\n00:23:10.941 --> 00:23:16.801\nBut that's just returning a single value\nof a single intersection of a row and\n\n394\n00:23:16.801 --> 00:23:17.536\ncolumn.\n\n395\n00:23:17.536 --> 00:23:23.530\nWhat if I wanted to use this but\n\n396\n00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:28.860\nthen say I want to\nreturn the whole record.\n\n397\n00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:32.660\nNow this terminology is something\nwe use in database language.\n\n398\n00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:35.830\nI want the record across.\n\n399\n00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:38.340\nIn databases as well,\nif I want the column,\n\n400\n00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:40.430\nthey usually refer to that as the field.\n\n401\n00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:41.980\nI want the field.\n\n402\n00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:48.090\nSo if I wanted to return, not just this,\nI want you to return all of this.\n\n403\n00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:54.590\nGive me this whole thing of Fuego meows or\nFuego swipes.\n\n404\n00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:56.190\nI want the whole record.\n\n405\n00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:58.725\nOr how about the cat's meow?\n\n406\n00:23:58.725 --> 00:24:02.840\n[LAUGH] In January, right there.\n\n407\n00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:05.630\nI want the whole field or column.\n\n408\n00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:09.880\nHm, you can do this, okay.\n\n409\n00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:13.670\nAnd you are gonna use this function,\n\n410\n00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:16.570\nthe same function that we used\nwith the reference option.\n\n411\n00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:21.300\nOkay, so same syntax, but there's\na couple things that you're going to do.\n\n412\n00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:24.640\nYou're going to make,\nif you want the whole record,\n\n413\n00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:28.780\nyou need to change\nthe column reference to 0.\n\n414\n00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:32.498\nIf you want the whole column you\nhave to change the row to 0.\n\n415\n00:24:32.498 --> 00:24:36.480\nBecause I'm not returning the\nintersection, I'm returning just this, or\n\n416\n00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:37.150\njust this.\n\n417\n00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:38.970\nThat's one.\n\n418\n00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:45.555\nTwo, you need to make sure that\nyou actually perform the array\n\n419\n00:24:45.555 --> 00:24:51.590\ncalculation by using the Ctrl+Shift+Enter,\nand this is the same on Mac, by the way.\n\n420\n00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:54.990\nIt's not Cmd, it's Ctrl,\nCtrl+Shift+Enter, do that.\n\n421\n00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:58.400\nAnd then, the other thing is\nthat you need make sure that\n\n422\n00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:03.170\nyou are selecting the cells\nthat you want the record or\n\n423\n00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:08.550\ncolumn to go into before you even start.\n\n424\n00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:10.699\nOkay, so\nI had this written in the episode notes.\n\n425\n00:25:10.699 --> 00:25:14.312\nSo just know that there are some\nparameters that are going to need to\n\n426\n00:25:14.312 --> 00:25:15.290\nbe matched here.\n\n427\n00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:19.450\nSo this is why I changed\nthe background color.\n\n428\n00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:23.050\nI filled these in, I was like this is\nwhere I want the information to go.\n\n429\n00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:26.681\nHave to have it selected first, okay?\n\n430\n00:25:26.681 --> 00:25:27.770\nSo that's one of it.\n\n431\n00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:30.420\nNow I'm just going to take this because\nthis is gonna make it a little bit easier\n\n432\n00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:32.420\nfor us to go ahead and take all of this.\n\n433\n00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:36.605\nI'm going to just copy, hit the Escape,\n\n434\n00:25:36.605 --> 00:25:40.470\ndouble-click, paste, Enter.\n\n435\n00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:43.540\nThere's nothing different here, so\nI just wanted to have something for\n\n436\n00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:45.610\nus to go on first.\n\n437\n00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:51.590\nOkay, so now what I'm gonna wanna do,\njust like I told you,\n\n438\n00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:53.550\nI have to select the cells first.\n\n439\n00:25:54.880 --> 00:26:00.370\nFrom here what I need to do is I need\n\n440\n00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:05.310\nto say I wanna bring out Fuego Meow, so\nwe have to think about which one is this.\n\n441\n00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:08.970\nThis is the row reference,\nthat's one I wanna keep.\n\n442\n00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:14.326\nOkay, it's the column\nthat needs to go to zero.\n\n443\n00:26:14.326 --> 00:26:18.745\nThink, okay, that's all I need to do,\nright, and then you hit Enter and\n\n444\n00:26:18.745 --> 00:26:22.970\nit's gonna say, nope, I don't understand,\nI only did one and two.\n\n445\n00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:24.540\nWhat was the third one?\n\n446\n00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:28.100\nI have to come back into this,\nselect it first.\n\n447\n00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:29.290\nI have to come back into here.\n\n448\n00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:32.643\nI have to Ctrl+Shift+Enter.\n\n449\n00:26:32.643 --> 00:26:38.270\nAs soon as I did Ctrl+Shift+Enter,\nthen it returned the array.\n\n450\n00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:40.880\nAnd notice, look at the syntax here, too.\n\n451\n00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:45.660\nDo you see how it put everything,\nthe whole thing\n\n452\n00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:49.980\nwent into squigglies or\ncurly braces right there?\n\n453\n00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.727\nSo that's where it's saying okay,\nlook at the reference.\n\n454\n00:26:52.727 --> 00:26:59.860\nOkay, so we still said area 1,\nrow 4, column 0.\n\n455\n00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:01.310\nDon't give me any columns.\n\n456\n00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:06.070\nJust give me the whole thing\nfrom this particular table.\n\n457\n00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:09.420\nYou have to do Ctrl+Shift+Enter.\n\n458\n00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:16.331\nAnd that way, it will return\nthe entire record within that one.\n\n459\n00:27:16.331 --> 00:27:21.706\n[LAUGH] Justin, how you doing?\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot of stuff to remember.\n\n460\n00:27:21.706 --> 00:27:22.658\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n461\n00:27:22.658 --> 00:27:24.970\n&gt;&gt; I'm not gonna lie to you, Vonne.\n\n462\n00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:26.830\nI would probably mess\nthat up a bunch of times.\n\n463\n00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:29.850\nBut I mean,\nit does grab all those kind of as a chunk,\n\n464\n00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:31.630\nand puts them where they need to be.\n\n465\n00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:34.670\nBut I could see this being\na source of frustration.\n\n466\n00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:35.600\nI'd be like, whatever.\n\n467\n00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:40.140\nI'm going to just do a highlighted\nrange and count one, two,\n\n468\n00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:43.691\nthree, and [SOUND], move it to the right.\n&gt;&gt; You know what?\n\n469\n00:27:43.691 --> 00:27:45.120\nI don't blame you.\n\n470\n00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:51.010\nI do not blame you one\nbit cuz it is a lot.\n\n471\n00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:55.164\nBut it's gonna, there's a lot\nof reasons why people want this.\n\n472\n00:27:55.164 --> 00:28:00.690\nAnd I know how they're gonna extract\nthis out when you have multiple ranges,\n\n473\n00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:02.360\nand I want this particular thing.\n\n474\n00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:06.255\nSo it does have its functionality,\nbut I agree,\n\n475\n00:28:06.255 --> 00:28:11.765\nthere's always 15,000 other ways\n[LAUGH] to do the same thing.\n\n476\n00:28:11.765 --> 00:28:12.810\nAnd it just depends.\n\n477\n00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:18.040\nAnd that's why there's so many variations\non, almost the same result, in the end.\n\n478\n00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:22.790\nYou're just going through a whole set\nof different functions of how you\n\n479\n00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:23.930\nretrieve it.\n\n480\n00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:26.380\nSo I feel you.\n\n481\n00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:28.360\nI'm not gonna lie.\n\n482\n00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:33.250\nSo with this one, what I would want to do,\nwe would select all of this.\n\n483\n00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:36.638\nSo this is going to\nreturn the cat's meows.\n\n484\n00:28:36.638 --> 00:28:42.978\nSo on this one,\nI would change this to row 0,\n\n485\n00:28:42.978 --> 00:28:47.940\ncolumn 1 in that, and\n\n486\n00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:53.900\nthen do Ctrl+Shift+Enter and then you\ncan see it's going to pull that out.\n\n487\n00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:55.670\nOkay, pretty cool.\n\n488\n00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:58.340\nLet's just say for\nsome reason I wanted to,\n\n489\n00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:01.410\ninstead of having this be Fuego,\nI wanted it to be Puma.\n\n490\n00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:07.170\nOkay, so\nif I want it to be Puma in swipes,\n\n491\n00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:10.150\nJustin, I know you're not\nfeeling this one so far.\n\n492\n00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:15.340\nBut if I wanted this one,\nwe would have to change what\n\n493\n00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:19.925\nvalues up here on Puma?\n&gt;&gt; That 4 needs to become a 2 and\n\n494\n00:29:19.925 --> 00:29:22.760\nthat 1 needs to become a 2, as well.\n\n495\n00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:26.940\nThen a Ctrl+Shift+Enter, I'm guessing.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, now,\n\n496\n00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:29.520\ndid you see me select all the cells first?\n\n497\n00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:32.395\nI didn't by the way, okay, I did not.\n\n498\n00:29:32.395 --> 00:29:34.335\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was really focused on that red table.\n\n499\n00:29:34.335 --> 00:29:35.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n500\n00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:37.310\nI did not select the three cells.\n\n501\n00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:39.262\nRemember, I said you have to do that.\n\n502\n00:29:39.262 --> 00:29:43.511\nWatch, if I do this,\nit will automatically do it for\n\n503\n00:29:43.511 --> 00:29:49.270\nme because it already understands\nthat this is the array, okay?\n\n504\n00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:50.860\nSo just be careful about that.\n\n505\n00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:55.930\nAnd if I had done this, and let's go back\nand put it to, what was it, a 4 and 1.\n\n506\n00:29:55.930 --> 00:30:00.940\nAnd then I just hit Enter,\nyou can't change this.\n\n507\n00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:02.010\nWhy not?\n\n508\n00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:03.850\nI didn't do Ctrl+Shift+Enter.\n\n509\n00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:08.130\nI just did Enter, so you click OK and\nthen you go Ctrl+Shift+Enter, and\n\n510\n00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:08.780\nthen it does it.\n\n511\n00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:11.310\nBut again,\nI didn't have anything selected, but\n\n512\n00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:13.490\nI had already done it from the beginning.\n\n513\n00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:15.766\nI can tell you are not\nfeeling this one [LAUGH].\n\n514\n00:30:15.766 --> 00:30:17.533\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm just gonna go out on a limb\n\n515\n00:30:17.533 --> 00:30:19.785\nhere and\nsay I shan't be using this function.\n\n516\n00:30:19.785 --> 00:30:20.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n517\n00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:23.897\n&gt;&gt; Not in this capacity anyway.\n\n518\n00:30:23.897 --> 00:30:25.226\n&gt;&gt; What's the whole purpose of\n\n519\n00:30:25.226 --> 00:30:26.300\nthese episodes?\n\n520\n00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:31.150\nIt's for\nyou to understand what the function does.\n\n521\n00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:33.100\nWill you ever use this example?\n\n522\n00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:41.240\nMaybe, maybe not, but\nI feel to me, I want to explain\n\n523\n00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:47.100\nwhy they have two variations and\nwhen would you use the two variations.\n\n524\n00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:51.770\nThat's the whole goal within this episode.\n\n525\n00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:55.709\nOkay, so you can create your opinions\non which way you wanna go with it.\n\n526\n00:30:55.709 --> 00:30:59.090\nSo why don't we go to one\nthat I think you might like.\n\n527\n00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:02.010\nLet's get off these arrays and\neverything like that.\n\n528\n00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:06.050\nBut at least you understand,\nhave a reference point of where this goes.\n\n529\n00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:12.080\nA lot of times,\nwhat you do is you use index with match.\n\n530\n00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:16.500\nBecause we're specifically\ntyping in number 3, right?\n\n531\n00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:23.617\nHere, we're going to go ahead and\nsay column 3, row.\n\n532\n00:31:23.617 --> 00:31:28.540\nGosh, row 3, column 3, ugh.\n\n533\n00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:31.120\nWhy don't we make this dynamic?\n\n534\n00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.875\nWell, what does the match do?\n\n535\n00:31:32.875 --> 00:31:35.410\nThe match returns positions, okay?\n\n536\n00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:40.030\nAnd this particular one right here\nis it's looking up this value.\n\n537\n00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:44.250\nAnd then it's going over to this range.\n\n538\n00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:50.180\nAnd then it is giving me an exact match,\nso that's where Pumpkin is coming from.\n\n539\n00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:52.610\nAnd it's position number 3.\n\n540\n00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:56.270\nRight here, March, look at this.\n\n541\n00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:59.670\nFind it in here,\ntell me what the position is.\n\n542\n00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:04.130\nThree, where do we see the threes in here?\n\n543\n00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:04.990\nRight there.\n\n544\n00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:11.640\nSo wait a second, I put what this is\nthe column, sorry, the row reference.\n\n545\n00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.610\nJust put the match function in there.\n\n546\n00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:16.200\nThis column reference.\n\n547\n00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.580\nI'll put a match function.\n\n548\n00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:20.630\nCool.\nSo whatever I type in here is going to go\n\n549\n00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:21.860\nahead and dynamically change right there.\n\n550\n00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:24.400\nThere you go.\n\n551\n00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:25.840\nThat can be kind of fun.\n\n552\n00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.010\nSo how do I do it?\n\n553\n00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:29.640\nI've got part of it already\nwritten out for us.\n\n554\n00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:34.610\nThat's why I did it in\nthese a stepped area.\n\n555\n00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:38.580\nSo I'm going to copy this,\nhit Escape so you don't go into there.\n\n556\n00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:42.790\nCome into this result and\nthen I will paste it.\n\n557\n00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:43.498\nNothing different right there.\n\n558\n00:32:43.498 --> 00:32:46.000\nOops, there we go.\n\n559\n00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.320\nThat's a little bit behind the head, but\n\n560\n00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:49.240\nwe'll come back to it in just a second,\nokay.\n\n561\n00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:53.050\nSo, when we have this result right there.\n\n562\n00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:56.155\nSo now, I have to change that out.\n\n563\n00:32:56.155 --> 00:32:59.740\nOkay, so I'm going to hit the escape key,\ncome back into this.\n\n564\n00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:01.870\nNow wait, we got to remember.\n\n565\n00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:03.750\nWhich way does it go first?\n\n566\n00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:07.300\nWe have row, then column.\n\n567\n00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:10.410\nRemember earlier we talked about just and\nI said,\n\n568\n00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:12.970\nyou got to be really\ncareful about which way.\n\n569\n00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:16.860\nAnd you have to go with the way\nthe formula or the function goes.\n\n570\n00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:22.170\nThe cats, that's my row.\n\n571\n00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:24.180\nThat's up here, right?\n\n572\n00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:27.980\nSo I have to double check to\nmake sure that is the pumpkin.\n\n573\n00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:29.640\nOkay so that is my row.\n\n574\n00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:33.720\nSo let's take this let's copy that, okay.\n\n575\n00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:34.750\nHit the escape.\n\n576\n00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:39.290\nCome into here, that's the row.\n\n577\n00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:40.710\nYes, it's this one.\n\n578\n00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:41.550\nOkay perfect.\n\n579\n00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:46.420\nLet's go put that one in there,\ncareful you gotta get rid of the equals,\n\n580\n00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:48.750\ncan't have two equals there.\n\n581\n00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:54.380\nThat's going to be, okay,\nlookup b, call row, okay.\n\n582\n00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:56.270\nGoing to hit Enter.\n\n583\n00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:58.470\nWe're going to come back in to here.\n\n584\n00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:03.630\nThis is the column, copy that, Escape.\n\n585\n00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:07.420\nCome in to here, that will be here.\n\n586\n00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:10.320\nI want to paste that in to there.\n\n587\n00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.699\nGet rid of the equals.\n\n588\n00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:14.010\nAll right, let's see.\n\n589\n00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:22.210\nWe're still returning 302 but\nif I change this to Bishop, look at that!\n\n590\n00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:25.440\nAnd then I type this in January.\n\n591\n00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:30.250\nThat's kinda neat,\nnow I've got an actual dynamic table.\n\n592\n00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:34.230\nSo where I can go ahead and\njust type in which CAT I want.\n\n593\n00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:42.970\nDo be careful,\nbecause if I did a spack, right?\n\n594\n00:34:42.970 --> 00:34:45.980\nThat's not gonna work,\nbecause that's not a cat.\n\n595\n00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:48.210\nSo you gotta be careful\nabout what you're typing in.\n\n596\n00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:52.780\nI think I did this before, and I typed in\nhere and I'm like why isn't it working?\n\n597\n00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:58.640\nI thought I had a cell reference wrong or\nsomething really off the chart.\n\n598\n00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:00.455\nWell, what's the problem, Justin?\n\n599\n00:35:00.455 --> 00:35:03.300\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well MARCH does not match\n\n600\n00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:04.300\nMAR.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n601\n00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:05.370\n&gt;&gt; So we're using\n\n602\n00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:07.730\nabbreviations versus whole name.\n\n603\n00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:10.180\nWhich actually we're talking about typing,\nbut\n\n604\n00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:13.270\nmy noodle the whole time's been going,\nwait a minute.\n\n605\n00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:16.870\nCouldn't we just create drop-down lists\nfrom the respective rows and column\n\n606\n00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:21.430\nheaders and that way it would go boop!\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that would be so smart!\n\n607\n00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:23.360\nAnd yeah, you totally can do that.\n\n608\n00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:25.610\nDo you remeber what you have to\ndo to make drop-downs in Excel?\n\n609\n00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:27.640\n&gt;&gt; Well, you need a list\n\n610\n00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:28.840\nof them somewhere.\n\n611\n00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:32.165\nAnd then there's some\nother things you gotta do.\n\n612\n00:35:32.165 --> 00:35:33.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n613\n00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:35.500\n&gt;&gt; That is the best explanation I\n\n614\n00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.880\ncould ever find.\n\n615\n00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:39.370\nIt's in data validation.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n616\n00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:40.670\n&gt;&gt; See, the reason I can't remember that,\n\n617\n00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:42.730\nthat doesn't make sense to me.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n618\n00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:44.284\n&gt;&gt; In my mind it doesn't make sense, but\n\n619\n00:35:44.284 --> 00:35:47.501\nwhen you really think about it you are\nvalidating that it comes from this list.\n\n620\n00:35:47.501 --> 00:35:51.496\nI think that's a little beyond the scope\nof what we're trying to do but you could\n\n621\n00:35:51.496 --> 00:35:54.640\ndo that and then you eliminate title.\n&gt;&gt; Totally, exactly.\n\n622\n00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:58.090\nYeah, so,if you don't know how to do data\nvalidation or creating dropdown lists,\n\n623\n00:35:58.090 --> 00:35:59.790\ndefinitely go back and\ncheck that episode out.\n\n624\n00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:03.450\nIt's in the Advanced series and\nthat's where it's kinda fun.\n\n625\n00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:06.550\nBut now, you can see like,\nthis is super cool.\n\n626\n00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:08.980\nThis is where the dynamicness [LAUGH] of\n\n627\n00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:14.250\nthese two functions can be\npretty if you put them together.\n\n628\n00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:19.670\nAnd use, now I understand when and\nwhere I probably wanna use a match.\n\n629\n00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:21.990\nAnd how I can use that within than and\n\n630\n00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:27.230\nI can do some pretty cool\nlookups with my information.\n\n631\n00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:30.380\nThat's pretty neat.\n\n632\n00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:32.170\nThey're pretty cool functions.\n\n633\n00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:36.177\nNow that we've got off the ones that\nyou were like I don't want that,\n\n634\n00:36:36.177 --> 00:36:37.710\nyou like this?\n&gt;&gt; So I will tell you.\n\n635\n00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:40.840\nMatch this up with the index function and\nI will like it.\n\n636\n00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:44.670\nBut all that array shenanigans, even\nthough I like arrays in some of my world.\n\n637\n00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:47.689\nThat array shenanigans,\nI wasn't feeling that.\n\n638\n00:36:47.689 --> 00:36:48.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n639\n00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:51.070\n&gt;&gt; There was too much to, I don't know.\n\n640\n00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:55.490\nFelt like I was played like a crisis or\nsome kind of game for the keyboard.\n\n641\n00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:59.330\nI don't know, it was weird, but\nyou know Vonne this can be very helpful.\n\n642\n00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:01.730\nAnd I can see how if you\nhave very complex data and\n\n643\n00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:05.860\nyou needed to multi-source,\nthis could be incredibly useful.\n\n644\n00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:09.260\nNow before we get out of here\nVonne are there final gadgets or\n\n645\n00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:12.640\nthings to remember of the index function,\nor match or\n\n646\n00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:17.200\ncombination thereof?\n&gt;&gt; Lookups can take on so many forms,okay.\n\n647\n00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:22.144\nI mean, there are just examples after\nexamples after examples of how you\n\n648\n00:37:22.144 --> 00:37:26.049\ncan use this in different ways\nof trying to get your data.\n\n649\n00:37:26.049 --> 00:37:28.580\nSo this one's just, to me,\njust a few of them.\n\n650\n00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:32.360\nJust trying to give you an idea of\nwhy we're doing these episodes of\n\n651\n00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:37.560\nunderstanding what these functions do and\njust kinda stop, okay.\n\n652\n00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:40.490\nFew little examples to get the ideas.\n\n653\n00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:45.500\nBut how you put it all together,\nthat's a lot.\n\n654\n00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:48.800\nSo just know there are lots\nof variations on these.\n\n655\n00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:49.660\n&gt;&gt; Well there you have it.\n\n656\n00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:54.020\nSome great advice about look up some and\nkinda, keeping your mind in check.\n\n657\n00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:57.870\nBut well, don't look away, because\nthere's more Office Pro coming at you.\n\n658\n00:37:57.870 --> 00:37:59.650\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n659\n00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:02.010\nSo signing off for OFFICEPRO.TV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n660\n00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:03.020\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n661\n00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:04.757\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n662\n00:38:04.757 --> 00:38:06.801\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.836 --> 00:00:19.021\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and\nwell, you asked for it, so\n\n4\n00:00:19.021 --> 00:00:21.780\nwe're bring it back to you\nmore Excel functions, and\n\n5\n00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.057\nin this episode we're actually,\nwe're looking at VLOOKUP.\n\n6\n00:00:25.057 --> 00:00:30.170\nI gotta guess at what that means,\nbut I'm not gonna say it right now.\n\n7\n00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.280\nWe're actually gonna turn it over to\nthe one and only Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n8\n00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.739\nHow are you doing today, Vonne?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic.\n\n9\n00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.475\nHow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic as well.\n\n10\n00:00:37.475 --> 00:00:40.646\nVLOOKUP, sounds like they took the word\nlook up and just put a V in front of it.\n\n11\n00:00:40.646 --> 00:00:43.589\nIs it, that was my guess, am I right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n12\n00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:45.244\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n13\n00:00:45.244 --> 00:00:46.535\n&gt;&gt; Pretty much, so\n\n14\n00:00:46.535 --> 00:00:50.850\nwhat do you think that V srtands for?\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna say Vertical.\n\n15\n00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.747\n&gt;&gt; You are correct again.\n\n16\n00:00:51.747 --> 00:00:52.929\n&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]\n\n17\n00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:55.937\n&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE] And we're done no, yes,\n\n18\n00:00:55.937 --> 00:01:00.800\nthis is probably the most\npopular function in Excel.\n\n19\n00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.870\nNext to probably some, okay?\n\n20\n00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.960\nBecause this is something that\neverybody needs from their dad.\n\n21\n00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.527\nOr at least most people\nneed from their daddy.\n\n22\n00:01:08.527 --> 00:01:10.810\nYou need to look something up.\n\n23\n00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.210\nI need to find something and\nretrieve a value.\n\n24\n00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.380\nLike well we've done a lot of things.\n\n25\n00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.000\nWe've done find, search, we did mash it.\n\n26\n00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.250\nAnd as we did all sorts of different\nthings, that's sounds like exactly that,\n\n27\n00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.950\nbut this is specific and so,\n\n28\n00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.190\nwe're gonna walk through the arguments\nthat are in this part particular function.\n\n29\n00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.226\nAlso, I wanna start with like the,\nhow you think of it.\n\n30\n00:01:34.226 --> 00:01:38.524\nAnd I try and said that lets talk about\nit in human terminology, and then lets\n\n31\n00:01:38.524 --> 00:01:42.755\ngo over and talk about it in computer\nterminology of how these arguments and\n\n32\n00:01:42.755 --> 00:01:44.112\none of the table array.\n\n33\n00:01:44.112 --> 00:01:47.126\nAnd what is the look of value,\nwhat does that all mean?\n\n34\n00:01:47.126 --> 00:01:51.839\nLet's just start with how we would\ndo things as, you and me as humans.\n\n35\n00:01:51.839 --> 00:01:53.865\nSo I'm gonna test you yet again Justin,\n\n36\n00:01:53.865 --> 00:01:57.383\nI'm gonna ask you some questions\nabout this particular worksheet and\n\n37\n00:01:57.383 --> 00:02:01.672\nyou're gonna tell me how it goes, ready?\n&gt;&gt; I'm as ready as I could possibly be.\n\n38\n00:02:01.672 --> 00:02:04.263\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's not too hard cuz we're\n\n39\n00:02:04.263 --> 00:02:06.947\nthinking like human still, okay?\n\n40\n00:02:06.947 --> 00:02:09.853\nSo take all your code and\nstuff out the window.\n\n41\n00:02:09.853 --> 00:02:14.001\nSo if I ask you looking at this we\nhave some first and last names,\n\n42\n00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:16.054\ndepartments and team colors.\n\n43\n00:02:16.054 --> 00:02:21.244\nIf I was going to ask you, can you tell\n\n44\n00:02:21.244 --> 00:02:26.432\nme what team color bishop is?\n&gt;&gt; Blue.\n\n45\n00:02:26.432 --> 00:02:29.422\n&gt;&gt; Okay, you gave him in the result\n\n46\n00:02:29.422 --> 00:02:31.452\n&gt;&gt; Tell me how you did that.\n\n47\n00:02:31.452 --> 00:02:32.713\n&gt;&gt; All right, so when you asked for\n\n48\n00:02:32.713 --> 00:02:34.453\nBishop, I assumed that was the first name.\n\n49\n00:02:34.453 --> 00:02:38.695\nSo I found the column\nheading that said first, and\n\n50\n00:02:38.695 --> 00:02:42.645\nthen I ran vertically to\nfind the word Bishop.\n\n51\n00:02:42.645 --> 00:02:44.128\nSo I matched that and\n\n52\n00:02:44.128 --> 00:02:47.451\nthen I went over to the team color column\n&gt;&gt; And said,\n\n53\n00:02:47.451 --> 00:02:50.469\nthere's the corresponding color.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah, and\n\n54\n00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:55.650\nthat's what we said, cuz I said,\nI want you to look up Bishop.\n\n55\n00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.100\nSo that is our lookup value.\n\n56\n00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.157\nI want you to find this.\n\n57\n00:03:00.157 --> 00:03:04.774\nFor example, if I told you to find a cat\nblossom, I'll answer this for you,\n\n58\n00:03:04.774 --> 00:03:06.810\nbecause It's the same process.\n\n59\n00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.303\nI would look to this cell, right here and\nsay, I'm looking for Blossom and\n\n60\n00:03:11.303 --> 00:03:13.936\ncome over here, so\nBlossom is the first name.\n\n61\n00:03:13.936 --> 00:03:18.826\nSo let me come down,\nthere's Blossom and then let's go over,\n\n62\n00:03:18.826 --> 00:03:23.717\nnow, I'm looking at this whole\nthing as the data, the table,\n\n63\n00:03:23.717 --> 00:03:29.340\nthe range, the array,\nwe'll throw out every single word we can.\n\n64\n00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.720\nIt's just this is the set of information.\n\n65\n00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.700\nSo I went over, from here,\nI went one, well, actually,\n\n66\n00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.910\nlet me count one, two, three,\nfour, because this table,\n\n67\n00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.370\nthis whole thing has one,\ntwo, three, four columns.\n\n68\n00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.395\nWe're not looking at column labels or\ncolumn headers in Excel.\n\n69\n00:03:52.395 --> 00:03:55.455\nIt doesn't matter that it's A, B,\nC, it doesn't matter the location.\n\n70\n00:03:55.455 --> 00:04:01.523\nWe're talking about this as one\ncontiguous set of data of my table array.\n\n71\n00:04:01.523 --> 00:04:07.584\nAnd the look up from here, this cell\nwas the first, not just the first name,\n\n72\n00:04:07.584 --> 00:04:12.513\nI'm talking about column number one,\nvertically aligned or\n\n73\n00:04:12.513 --> 00:04:17.438\nvertically organized, and\nthen we went over from one, two,\n\n74\n00:04:17.438 --> 00:04:22.050\nthree, four and\nthat returns the value, okay?\n\n75\n00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:27.531\nBecause that's exactly what we're going to\ntell the function of the VLOOKUP to do,\n\n76\n00:04:27.531 --> 00:04:29.086\nthat exact same thing.\n\n77\n00:04:29.086 --> 00:04:33.579\nLook it here, in this table, find it,\n\n78\n00:04:33.579 --> 00:04:39.300\nmatch it, and\nthen return the fourth column.\n\n79\n00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.750\nWhat's in that fourth column?\n\n80\n00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.643\nThat is yellow, so that would be\nthe team color for, well, awesome, cool.\n\n81\n00:04:46.643 --> 00:04:49.350\nSame idea, slight variation.\n\n82\n00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.280\nIf I was looking up by last name,\n\n83\n00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.620\nI want to find what department is\nthe cat with the last name of socks?\n\n84\n00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.410\nI don't go over to the first,\nI go over to last.\n\n85\n00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.730\nI find socks, and then I go over to sales.\n\n86\n00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.767\nSame idea, there's gonna be a slight\ngotcha in that one when we actually\n\n87\n00:05:08.767 --> 00:05:12.315\ndo the function, but\njust keep that in mind, okay?\n\n88\n00:05:12.315 --> 00:05:14.160\nA little foreshadowing.\n\n89\n00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.460\nAnother question Justin, okay?\n\n90\n00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.799\nNormal sock, if I'm looking at these cats,\nokay, these are their sales, okay.\n\n91\n00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.060\nThis is our,\nwe have like a tiered commission rate, so\n\n92\n00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.900\nif you get this many sales and\nyou get this percentage, but\n\n93\n00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.539\nyou have to meet that goal to be able\nto achieve that commission rate.\n\n94\n00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:37.019\nSo if I looked at Bishop,\nwhat would Bishop's commission rate be?\n\n95\n00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:39.160\nJust the rate.\n&gt;&gt; 10%\n\n96\n00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.202\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so you looked at this,\n\n97\n00:05:41.202 --> 00:05:46.230\ncame over here, return 10\n&gt;&gt; Cool, what about Uma?\n\n98\n00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:51.950\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna guess 5%.\n\n99\n00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.190\n&gt;&gt; Why?\n\n100\n00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.250\n&gt;&gt; Because I ran down to 100,\n\n101\n00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.390\nknow that's not a match,\n\n102\n00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:01.310\n150 that's too big, so I'm guessing,\nbased on previous experience,\n\n103\n00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.360\nit's gonna fall back to the previous\none that does not exceed that one.\n\n104\n00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.953\nYou are correct again, man, you are on\ntask today, good reading those notes.\n\n105\n00:06:09.953 --> 00:06:13.795\n[LAUGH] I know you've done these\nfunctions before, but yes,\n\n106\n00:06:13.795 --> 00:06:19.220\nwe talked about this like approximating\nmatch in well, the match episode, right?\n\n107\n00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.971\nAnd you were really trying to\nbreak that one, remember that?\n\n108\n00:06:21.971 --> 00:06:25.870\nYeah, so watch that episode,\nif you're familiar and\n\n109\n00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:31.042\nnot actually match index together is\nlike an alternative to VLOOKUPs and\n\n110\n00:06:31.042 --> 00:06:35.132\nthey're very similar,\nthey have different meanings.\n\n111\n00:06:35.132 --> 00:06:38.055\nAnd they're the same but\ndifferent, I know.\n\n112\n00:06:38.055 --> 00:06:40.950\nAll right, so that's something\nthat we're going to use and\n\n113\n00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:44.210\nthat's about what is a match type not,\nI shouldn't say match.\n\n114\n00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:48.654\nI should say, look up,\nI can't remember the actual argument name.\n\n115\n00:06:48.654 --> 00:06:52.317\nOnce we get into it, I'll tell you\nthe exact thing, but it's like do I want\n\n116\n00:06:52.317 --> 00:06:56.374\nan exact match or an approximation.\n&gt;&gt; I think that is called the match type,\n\n117\n00:06:56.374 --> 00:06:58.350\nI think it was or something type.\n\n118\n00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.470\nIt had the word type in it,\nand it was negative 101,\n\n119\n00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:05.360\nare we talking about the same parameter?\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's the match function.\n\n120\n00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.460\nCorrect, there was that in the VLOOKUP,\nyou see the true or false.\n\n121\n00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.540\nSame idea just different placement in\ndifferent placement of the argument.\n\n122\n00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.370\nI just can't remember\nthe arguments specific name.\n\n123\n00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.055\nBut you know what, we'll see when we\nactually go ahead and perform it.\n\n124\n00:07:20.055 --> 00:07:21.395\nSo why don't we do that?\n\n125\n00:07:21.395 --> 00:07:24.151\nLet's come back over to the team color,\nand\n\n126\n00:07:24.151 --> 00:07:28.174\nwe're going to look up the team color for\nthe cat's first name,\n\n127\n00:07:28.174 --> 00:07:32.485\njust like we talked about and\njust like I was quizzing Justin.\n\n128\n00:07:32.485 --> 00:07:35.942\nWe're just gonna do it with the function.\n\n129\n00:07:35.942 --> 00:07:40.655\nSo selected insert function dialogue box,\nI actually I don't have\n\n130\n00:07:40.655 --> 00:07:45.100\nthe VLOOKUP already in there,\nbut this is in our lookup group.\n\n131\n00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:49.104\nSo look up and reference, so\nI can find this, and then scroll on that.\n\n132\n00:07:49.104 --> 00:07:54.270\nThat's the last one, cuz it's vertical,\nokay, and let's actually just\n\n133\n00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:59.356\nread this for a second,you see looks for\nthe value in the left most column of\n\n134\n00:07:59.356 --> 00:08:04.302\na table Then return the value in the same\nrow from a column you specified.\n\n135\n00:08:04.302 --> 00:08:08.636\nJust like I had said,\nhow we walked ourselves through it.\n\n136\n00:08:08.636 --> 00:08:13.332\nBy default, the table must be\nsorted in ascending order.\n\n137\n00:08:13.332 --> 00:08:14.378\nRemember the whole match thing?\n\n138\n00:08:14.378 --> 00:08:19.520\nSorting does matter if you're doing\napproximation, keep that in mind.\n\n139\n00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.238\nLet's click OK cuz right here,\nwe're not doing approximation already,\n\n140\n00:08:23.238 --> 00:08:24.601\nwe're looking for names.\n\n141\n00:08:24.601 --> 00:08:31.269\nSo we're gonna need, is the Range_lookup,\nthat is the parameter name.\n\n142\n00:08:31.269 --> 00:08:34.221\nYeah, okay so why don't we go ahead and\n\n143\n00:08:34.221 --> 00:08:38.346\nwalk through exactly what\nthis function is asking us?\n\n144\n00:08:38.346 --> 00:08:42.028\nJust like I had told you,\nwhat am I looking up?\n\n145\n00:08:42.028 --> 00:08:49.402\nI am looking up Blossom, I am looking at\nthe cat's name that lives in this cell H2.\n\n146\n00:08:49.402 --> 00:08:52.617\nSo find that,\nthis is the thing you gonna look up.\n\n147\n00:08:52.617 --> 00:08:55.740\nWhere are you going to look this up?\n\n148\n00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.811\nPut your cursor on the table array,\nit's all of this.\n\n149\n00:08:59.811 --> 00:09:04.995\nI'm gonna use my Shift key to go ahead and\nuse my Shift click, and\n\n150\n00:09:04.995 --> 00:09:10.485\nsay, this whole table array,\nstarting at first and going to last.\n\n151\n00:09:10.485 --> 00:09:12.141\nSo we're starting at the leftmost column.\n\n152\n00:09:12.141 --> 00:09:16.598\nSo that's why we said\nBlossom here is gonna be\n\n153\n00:09:16.598 --> 00:09:20.831\nfound in Blossom here, the first column.\n\n154\n00:09:20.831 --> 00:09:25.581\nNow the column index number is\nthe column number in the table\n\n155\n00:09:25.581 --> 00:09:30.252\narray from which the matching\nvalues should be returned.\n\n156\n00:09:30.252 --> 00:09:35.054\nThe first column of values\nin the table is column one.\n\n157\n00:09:35.054 --> 00:09:40.052\nThat was me trying to emphasize\na couple times, column one,\n\n158\n00:09:40.052 --> 00:09:45.442\ncolumn two, three, four,\nfirst, last, department, team.\n\n159\n00:09:45.442 --> 00:09:49.301\nOne, two, three, four,\nwhat are we returning?\n\n160\n00:09:49.301 --> 00:09:55.244\nTeam color, that is four, so\ncolumn index number, four.\n\n161\n00:09:55.244 --> 00:09:59.899\nAnd if this is an optional value,\nnotice how it's not in bold.\n\n162\n00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:06.131\nThe thing about this one, is saying right\nhere, is a logical value, Range_lookup.\n\n163\n00:10:06.131 --> 00:10:09.292\n[LAUGH] Doesn't make any sense, if like\nwhat the actual name of the argument.\n\n164\n00:10:09.292 --> 00:10:14.894\nIt's a logical value to find the closest\nmatch in the first consorted\n\n165\n00:10:14.894 --> 00:10:20.220\nin ascending order, true or\nomitted, not admitted, omitted.\n\n166\n00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:24.625\nOkay, by default, if you leave this blank,\nit's always gonna do in approximation.\n\n167\n00:10:24.625 --> 00:10:29.640\nWith texts, you can get varying results,\nyou remember that match up,\n\n168\n00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.579\nas we really try that,\nhe was really trying to break it.\n\n169\n00:10:33.579 --> 00:10:36.673\nIf you leave this blank,\nit will always be true,\n\n170\n00:10:36.673 --> 00:10:39.924\nwhich means,\nit will find you the approximation.\n\n171\n00:10:39.924 --> 00:10:45.050\nThis is where if you want an exact match,\nyou really need to type in false, okay?\n\n172\n00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:49.716\nWhen we get into that tiered commission,\nthat's where approximation will be fine.\n\n173\n00:10:49.716 --> 00:10:52.606\nAnd but again, have to have it sorted,\nif it's not sorted,\n\n174\n00:10:52.606 --> 00:10:54.830\nyou're gonna get some weird results, okay.\n\n175\n00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:59.904\nSo that's exactly what I want, perfect,\nwe click OK, and there you go.\n\n176\n00:10:59.904 --> 00:11:03.363\nIt has returned Yellow,\nexactly what I told it.\n\n177\n00:11:03.363 --> 00:11:07.703\nBut if I came into here and\ntyped in Fuego,\n\n178\n00:11:07.703 --> 00:11:11.053\nthe Fuego turns to green, yay.\n\n179\n00:11:11.053 --> 00:11:18.013\nIf I typed in Bishop, Bishop is blue,\nso on, and so fort, pretty cool.\n\n180\n00:11:18.013 --> 00:11:22.559\nBut what if I typed in Bashap, right?\n\n181\n00:11:22.559 --> 00:11:27.353\nI misspelled his name, then I'm going\nto get a nope, can't find that.\n\n182\n00:11:27.353 --> 00:11:29.462\nWhat if I added another space?\n\n183\n00:11:29.462 --> 00:11:30.861\nWhat if I did lower case?\n\n184\n00:11:30.861 --> 00:11:32.137\nWhat if I said Fuego?\n\n185\n00:11:32.137 --> 00:11:35.908\nOkay, so case sensitivity,\nor it's insensitive.\n\n186\n00:11:35.908 --> 00:11:40.496\nBut if I add in another space,\nthen that's not an exact match,\n\n187\n00:11:40.496 --> 00:11:42.671\nbecause I told it to be false.\n\n188\n00:11:42.671 --> 00:11:47.737\nYou throw that false off, and\nstart typing in names that don't exist,\n\n189\n00:11:47.737 --> 00:11:51.207\nyou might not get an N/A,\nyou might get a green.\n\n190\n00:11:51.207 --> 00:11:54.272\nBecause it's finding\nsomething that's closest and\n\n191\n00:11:54.272 --> 00:11:56.797\nthe way that it kinda\ntries to approximate.\n\n192\n00:11:56.797 --> 00:11:59.314\nAnd you might get some weird values,\nso be careful of that.\n\n193\n00:11:59.314 --> 00:12:03.988\nWhen you're doing text or you needed that,\ndefinitely type in false, all right.\n\n194\n00:12:03.988 --> 00:12:06.544\nThat's our lookup function,\nyou don't like that do you?\n\n195\n00:12:06.544 --> 00:12:08.789\n&gt;&gt; So number one, that name is horrible.\n\n196\n00:12:08.789 --> 00:12:14.093\nI mean, now, that's very much my opinion,\nI don't think that name appropriately,\n\n197\n00:12:14.093 --> 00:12:18.030\njust provides me an understanding\nof what that parameter does.\n\n198\n00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:22.451\nAlso the fact,\nthat it's true by default, right?\n\n199\n00:12:22.451 --> 00:12:24.750\nBecause that lack, is it true,\n\n200\n00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:26.981\nif it's approximation?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n201\n00:12:26.981 --> 00:12:27.573\n&gt;&gt; Or do I have their brackground?\n\n202\n00:12:27.573 --> 00:12:30.644\n&gt;&gt; No, the approximating is true.\n\n203\n00:12:30.644 --> 00:12:35.474\nAnd if you leave it blank,\nif you leave it optional argument blank,\n\n204\n00:12:35.474 --> 00:12:39.990\nit will default to true,\nwhich is the approximation, right?\n\n205\n00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:43.694\n[LAUGH] It's, I see your face.\n&gt;&gt; So that's the second part,\n\n206\n00:12:43.694 --> 00:12:45.941\nit's either true, or it's not there.\n\n207\n00:12:45.941 --> 00:12:51.388\nWell, in my mind, not there is\nkind of an implicit false, right?\n\n208\n00:12:51.388 --> 00:12:56.573\nSo it's either explicitly true or\nnot, right?\n\n209\n00:12:56.573 --> 00:13:00.266\nIt's either explicit true or false, or if\nyou leave it off, it's an implicit false,\n\n210\n00:13:00.266 --> 00:13:02.300\nbut it's actually\nbackwards in its function.\n\n211\n00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:03.548\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and Excel has,\n\n212\n00:13:03.548 --> 00:13:06.919\nit keeps doing this to us, and\nit's not consistent, is it?\n\n213\n00:13:06.919 --> 00:13:10.091\nIt's like, flips it when it's\nnot supposed to be flipped, and\n\n214\n00:13:10.091 --> 00:13:14.456\nit's not the same in all functions, and\nman, it'll get you all sorts of twisted.\n\n215\n00:13:14.456 --> 00:13:17.856\nI'll say, when I first started\nlearning about VLOOKUPs,\n\n216\n00:13:17.856 --> 00:13:21.878\nI didn't understand that either,\nso I just, I always left it blank.\n\n217\n00:13:21.878 --> 00:13:24.582\nNow, I was always finding exact matches,\nbut\n\n218\n00:13:24.582 --> 00:13:27.016\nI should have really been putting false.\n\n219\n00:13:27.016 --> 00:13:32.817\nBut by reading that I'm, like,\nI'm not totally, okay, sure, I get it.\n\n220\n00:13:32.817 --> 00:13:36.338\nAnd also, I probably wasn't really reading\nit very, very clearly, and I was just\n\n221\n00:13:36.338 --> 00:13:39.865\nlike, so I never put that in there.\n&gt;&gt; And just to be clear, you know, we talk\n\n222\n00:13:39.865 --> 00:13:43.840\nabout these words, these differences,\nbut Excel has a very long life span.\n\n223\n00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.765\nAnd these are probably things where,\n\n224\n00:13:45.765 --> 00:13:49.564\nall these functions came along when\nthese set of programmers were around.\n\n225\n00:13:49.564 --> 00:13:54.091\nAnd this is how they thought about it,\nand so this is an evolution of a product,\n\n226\n00:13:54.091 --> 00:13:55.818\nso those things just happen.\n\n227\n00:13:55.818 --> 00:13:58.515\nBut you need to be aware of them,\nbecause they kinda\n\n228\n00:13:58.515 --> 00:14:01.296\nthrow a monkey wrench into things.\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and\n\n229\n00:14:01.296 --> 00:14:03.825\nI'm gonna throw another\nmonkey wrench into this.\n\n230\n00:14:03.825 --> 00:14:05.260\nAnd just show you,\n\n231\n00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:10.841\nto really drive the home the point about\nwhat your table array needs to be.\n\n232\n00:14:10.841 --> 00:14:12.943\nLet's go through this,\nwe talked about last name.\n\n233\n00:14:12.943 --> 00:14:17.299\nWe're thinking, well this is the last\nname is in this table, right?\n\n234\n00:14:17.299 --> 00:14:20.797\nThis is our table array, so\nwhy don't I just use the same thing?\n\n235\n00:14:20.797 --> 00:14:26.279\nWhy don't I just go ahead and I'll\ntype this in, I'll do a VLOOKUP, okay?\n\n236\n00:14:26.279 --> 00:14:30.836\nAnd then I will say,\nI wanna look up at this value, comma,\n\n237\n00:14:30.836 --> 00:14:33.731\nI know that it is this range of cells.\n\n238\n00:14:33.731 --> 00:14:37.007\nThis is the same table\nthat I was using before.\n\n239\n00:14:37.007 --> 00:14:42.943\nAnd I want to return now,\nthe department is column three, right?\n\n240\n00:14:42.943 --> 00:14:47.369\nSo I'll type in three, and\nthen, I will type in false,\n\n241\n00:14:47.369 --> 00:14:50.398\nbecause I want it to be an exact match.\n\n242\n00:14:50.398 --> 00:14:54.017\nAnd then you hit Enter and\nyou're like well, why didn't that work?\n\n243\n00:14:54.017 --> 00:14:57.034\nIt's the third column in this\nwhole table array, right?\n\n244\n00:14:57.034 --> 00:15:02.971\nThis is the table, yeah, but\nthis thing that your looking up,\n\n245\n00:15:02.971 --> 00:15:07.003\nwhen you say that this\nis your table array,\n\n246\n00:15:07.003 --> 00:15:11.052\nyou might think, this is the whole thing.\n\n247\n00:15:11.052 --> 00:15:16.975\nBut it will always look\nto the leftmost column,\n\n248\n00:15:16.975 --> 00:15:23.058\nand try to find whatever\nis in your lookup value.\n\n249\n00:15:23.058 --> 00:15:27.298\nThat's not the first name,\nthat's the last name.\n\n250\n00:15:27.298 --> 00:15:31.348\nSo this table array,\nwhere we think it's one whole table,\n\n251\n00:15:31.348 --> 00:15:33.538\nnot the way the function works.\n\n252\n00:15:33.538 --> 00:15:36.922\nIf I want this function to work and\nlook up the last name,\n\n253\n00:15:36.922 --> 00:15:41.172\nthe first column in my table array\nneeds to be where the last name list.\n\n254\n00:15:41.172 --> 00:15:45.946\nThis can't be A2, it needs to be B2.\n\n255\n00:15:45.946 --> 00:15:49.670\nNow, I can include column D,\nbut am I using it,\n\n256\n00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:53.319\ndo I really need it to\nlook all the way that far?\n\n257\n00:15:53.319 --> 00:15:58.168\nNo, it won't hurt anything if you keep it,\nbut\n\n258\n00:15:58.168 --> 00:16:03.644\nI really just need this to go to C23,\nso just B and C.\n\n259\n00:16:03.644 --> 00:16:07.122\nThis is the table array that is used for\nthe function,\n\n260\n00:16:07.122 --> 00:16:10.760\nnot for\nhow we think of the collection of data.\n\n261\n00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.297\nThis is the left most columns.\n\n262\n00:16:12.297 --> 00:16:17.623\nThat's an important factor in\ndetermining your table array and\n\n263\n00:16:17.623 --> 00:16:19.800\nwhat you're looking up.\n\n264\n00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.150\nThey have to match in\nthe left most column.\n\n265\n00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:24.906\nAnd if I do this,\nnow the other thing I would need to do.\n\n266\n00:16:24.906 --> 00:16:26.580\nNow within this column.\n\n267\n00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:29.420\nHow many columns are in this table array,\nJustin?\n\n268\n00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:30.730\n&gt;&gt; There's only two in this.\n\n269\n00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:34.980\nSo I'm guessing any time you do this,\nwhat I would call like a sub table.\n\n270\n00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:38.180\nYou have to modify that because\nyour relative positioning changes.\n\n271\n00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:40.328\n&gt;&gt; Correct, do if I have one two.\n\n272\n00:16:40.328 --> 00:16:43.850\nOne is always going to be the first\ncolumn that you're looking up.\n\n273\n00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:47.510\nSo then I would need to\nreturn two not three.\n\n274\n00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:48.940\nThe two column table array.\n\n275\n00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:51.660\nI want you to return the second column.\n\n276\n00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:57.506\nAnd then when I look this up, yes,\nis Frido Socks, he is in Sales.\n\n277\n00:16:57.506 --> 00:17:01.525\nOkay, so that's the gotcha\nthat I wanted to let you know.\n\n278\n00:17:01.525 --> 00:17:05.250\nYou're gonna have to be careful about\nwhere your table arrays starts.\n\n279\n00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:06.996\nAnd what you're looking up,\nthey have to match.\n\n280\n00:17:06.996 --> 00:17:10.352\nThey don't, it's gonna be a little weird.\n\n281\n00:17:10.352 --> 00:17:16.290\nAnd especially if you had first and\nlast names, like Taylor Austin, right?\n\n282\n00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:18.980\nWell those both could be first names.\n\n283\n00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:22.750\nSomebody's first name could be Smith,\nright, Smith Jared.\n\n284\n00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:27.502\nI mean, there's other things like that so\nyou do have to be a little careful and\n\n285\n00:17:27.502 --> 00:17:31.687\nthat's where you could get wrong results,\nand not even knowing it.\n\n286\n00:17:31.687 --> 00:17:35.825\nAnd you know those are the worst types of\nerrors you were just talking about those\n\n287\n00:17:35.825 --> 00:17:37.433\nbefore we started.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n288\n00:17:37.433 --> 00:17:40.354\nthose are the hardest to track down and\nthey can cause the most distraction.\n\n289\n00:17:40.354 --> 00:17:42.681\nBecause you'll see\nsomething else go wrong,\n\n290\n00:17:42.681 --> 00:17:46.449\nespecially if you have really\ncomplicated and interdependent formulas.\n\n291\n00:17:46.449 --> 00:17:48.290\nAnd you go, what's over here?\n\n292\n00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:53.740\nThis looks right, this looks right, this\nlooks right and it's a propagated error.\n\n293\n00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:57.370\nI do have one thing,\nactually a couple of things.\n\n294\n00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:01.591\nCould we look at the function\ndialog box for VLOOKUP?\n\n295\n00:18:01.591 --> 00:18:04.392\nAll right, so it's funny,\n\n296\n00:18:04.392 --> 00:18:09.879\nsomewhere in there in the left\nmost column of the table,\n\n297\n00:18:09.879 --> 00:18:16.033\ncan you go to column index.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n298\n00:18:16.033 --> 00:18:17.114\n&gt;&gt; So right here,\n\n299\n00:18:17.114 --> 00:18:21.605\nthe first column of values is\na tape like there's that one little\n\n300\n00:18:21.605 --> 00:18:26.700\nsentence where you go,\nthat has some far reaching implications.\n\n301\n00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.050\nAnd then if you go to range lookup,\n\n302\n00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:29.849\nI think it actually says\nsomething additional.\n\n303\n00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:31.520\nThere it is.\n\n304\n00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:34.700\nFind the closest match\nin the first column.\n\n305\n00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.401\nIt's kind of enough,\nyou can't easily read over them, right?\n\n306\n00:18:37.401 --> 00:18:38.403\nYou go, that's good.\n\n307\n00:18:38.403 --> 00:18:41.906\nFirst column, you're always gonna\nbe looking in the first column.\n\n308\n00:18:41.906 --> 00:18:44.160\nThat's not what I thought, right?\n\n309\n00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.441\nAnd then so be careful when you're\nreading these function descriptions.\n\n310\n00:18:47.441 --> 00:18:49.160\n&gt;&gt; And the first time I was reading,\n\n311\n00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.640\nI'm like find the closest.\n\n312\n00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.560\nI'm like why would you ever\nwanna find the closest match?\n\n313\n00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.450\nYou're gonna find it.\n\n314\n00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:55.096\nAnd then I, wait.\n\n315\n00:18:55.096 --> 00:18:59.410\n[LAUGH] It took me, cuz I was,\nthat's why for me I was always finding.\n\n316\n00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:03.129\nSo I was like why would you\never wanna find the closest?\n\n317\n00:19:03.129 --> 00:19:04.860\nThat doesn't make any sense.\n\n318\n00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:07.457\nSo I was just like, okay,\nwhatever, so I just left it out.\n\n319\n00:19:07.457 --> 00:19:12.379\n[LAUGH] I didn't really read it so\ngood point.\n\n320\n00:19:12.379 --> 00:19:13.260\n&gt;&gt; Second thing,\n\n321\n00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:17.865\nwhat happens if say we forget, right and\nI'm gonna try to break it, we forget and\n\n322\n00:19:17.865 --> 00:19:20.942\nwe do that sub-table but\nwe leave the three in there.\n\n323\n00:19:20.942 --> 00:19:22.980\nDo we get whoopsie daisies?\n\n324\n00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:25.225\nDo we get not applicable, okay.\n\n325\n00:19:25.225 --> 00:19:26.370\nWill you get an explicit error,\n\n326\n00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:27.370\nwhich is good?\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n327\n00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:28.530\nI get a different type of error.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n328\n00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:30.170\n&gt;&gt; Notice I have a reference error.\n\n329\n00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:36.401\nYou're referring to something that doesn't\nexist in my brain, that's Excel talking.\n\n330\n00:19:36.401 --> 00:19:40.653\nSo it is a different one than the NA, it's\nlike not applicable, like nope, not found.\n\n331\n00:19:40.653 --> 00:19:45.500\nOkay, so do be careful and definitely look\nup those errors, all the different types.\n\n332\n00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:50.480\nIt does make a difference in how\nyou think of what's wrong and\n\n333\n00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.220\nmight help you in problem solving it.\n\n334\n00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:57.850\nSo back to the why you do\nwanna use the approximate.\n\n335\n00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:01.650\nJust right here we're talking about\nthe commission for Pooma and Pumpkin.\n\n336\n00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:04.425\nMan, Pumpkin almost got it, got 199 but\n\n337\n00:20:04.425 --> 00:20:07.910\nhe didn't get it 200 so\nhe's just gonna get it.\n\n338\n00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:10.350\nHe should be getting\na 10% commission rate.\n\n339\n00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:14.020\nCuz it needs to come down,\nfind the highest, oop, too high.\n\n340\n00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:16.550\nGo back up one because this is a vertical.\n\n341\n00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:21.390\nSo let's do it again, we will go ahead and\ndo the insert function dialogue box and\n\n342\n00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:24.490\nwe will find the lookup.\n\n343\n00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:27.660\nWe'll click OK, same thing,\nwhat am I looking up?\n\n344\n00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.450\nI look to,\nhow many sales does this person have?\n\n345\n00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:32.660\nClick the cursor.\n\n346\n00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:35.130\nWhat is my table array?\n\n347\n00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:36.206\nIt's here.\n\n348\n00:20:36.206 --> 00:20:40.840\nI know I'm gonna be using it again,\nit's my, it's working today.\n\n349\n00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.904\nI've had the weirdest luck with my F4 key.\n\n350\n00:20:43.904 --> 00:20:46.830\nNot on the Mac side, doesn't even work.\n\n351\n00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:50.503\nRight, and I kind of test in my Mac,\nthen I come over in my Windows.\n\n352\n00:20:50.503 --> 00:20:54.677\nSorry, just let me feel my pain right now.\n&gt;&gt; Get it all\n\n353\n00:20:54.677 --> 00:20:55.372\nout, Vonne.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n354\n00:20:55.372 --> 00:20:56.820\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes you just gonna vent.\n\n355\n00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:57.612\nThat's just what you gotta do.\n\n356\n00:20:57.612 --> 00:21:02.184\nI mean technology can be frustrating.\n&gt;&gt; I started doing like [SOUND].\n\n357\n00:21:02.184 --> 00:21:04.020\nDon't I know not to just click in.\n\n358\n00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:07.020\nClick, click, click, click, click,\nI was just getting so frustrated.\n\n359\n00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:07.910\nWe do it too.\n\n360\n00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:10.390\nAnd then column index,\nwhat am I looking at?\n\n361\n00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:12.050\nThis is my table array.\n\n362\n00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:17.430\nIt's column one, column two,\nreturn the second column.\n\n363\n00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:24.290\nThis one I'm gonna just leave it blank\nbecause I do want the approximate match.\n\n364\n00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:25.850\nAnd it is assorting ascending.\n\n365\n00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:27.500\nI already have it set up.\n\n366\n00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:30.380\nThis by the way, this cell was\nalready formatted as a percentage.\n\n367\n00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:33.310\nSo if your like,\nmine didn't do that automatically.\n\n368\n00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:35.840\nIt does work on cell formatting, okay.\n\n369\n00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.650\nJust because this is formatted as\na percentage, doesn't mean this one is.\n\n370\n00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:43.610\nSo be careful about that when\nretrieving information out of\n\n371\n00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:48.469\na table in a lookup, and\nthen making sure it is entered into\n\n372\n00:21:48.469 --> 00:21:51.955\nthe cell the right way\nthat you want it to.\n\n373\n00:21:51.955 --> 00:21:55.935\nAnd if I pull this down, and\nthen that looks pretty good, okay,\n\n374\n00:21:55.935 --> 00:21:57.500\nwe are good right there.\n\n375\n00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:58.904\nAnd that's what's going to happen.\n\n376\n00:21:58.904 --> 00:22:02.791\nSo our absolute referencing, always good,\n\n377\n00:22:02.791 --> 00:22:07.710\nlooking at the table,\neverything was sorted properly.\n\n378\n00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:14.040\nOur columns matched, meaning my lookup\nwas the first column in my table array.\n\n379\n00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:18.010\nCool, and this is where if\nyou do not sort it ascending.\n\n380\n00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:23.097\nSo I did this on purpose, I already\nwrote the function in here just so\n\n381\n00:22:23.097 --> 00:22:24.985\nmake a little less time.\n\n382\n00:22:24.985 --> 00:22:28.360\nIt is not sorted, so it is giving me a,\n\n383\n00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.967\nthat is not right, is it?\n&gt;&gt; No\n\n384\n00:22:30.967 --> 00:22:31.776\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n385\n00:22:31.776 --> 00:22:37.860\nthis is gonna give you all\nsorts of wrong information.\n\n386\n00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:40.710\nGiving you a value but it's not correct.\n\n387\n00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:42.820\nThis has to be sorted.\n\n388\n00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:48.180\nSo and if I went ahead and then I think\nif I go ahead and sort it right now.\n\n389\n00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.270\nYep, see, it goes ahead and fixed itself.\n\n390\n00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:57.830\nSo that's a good thing, so just watch for\nit and be careful about this.\n\n391\n00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:00.586\nHonestly that's how vertical lookups work.\n\n392\n00:23:00.586 --> 00:23:02.613\nThese episodes are about,\n\n393\n00:23:02.613 --> 00:23:07.430\njust understanding the concept\nof the formula or the function.\n\n394\n00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:11.070\nSo just a few last little things\nthat kind of keep going because\n\n395\n00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:15.275\nthere are tutorials upon\ntutorials out there about VLOOKUP.\n\n396\n00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:21.737\nI wouldn't say so many different ways\nto do a VLOOKUP, it's how to combine\n\n397\n00:23:21.737 --> 00:23:26.804\nthe VLOOKUP with other functions and\nhow can you kind of put it all together.\n\n398\n00:23:26.804 --> 00:23:32.235\nAnd really just taking looks at different\nexamples of data and looking at it.\n\n399\n00:23:32.235 --> 00:23:36.936\nIt's almost like the thinking process of,\nI have this, I want that and I want this.\n\n400\n00:23:36.936 --> 00:23:39.038\nHow am I gonna put all together?\n\n401\n00:23:39.038 --> 00:23:43.052\nA lot of times if it's I'm looking for\nsomething, you're gonna do a VLOOKUP.\n\n402\n00:23:43.052 --> 00:23:50.056\nCuz most of your information, say it's\ngonna be in a vertical alignment or\n\n403\n00:23:50.056 --> 00:23:56.630\na vertical organization so\nthat's why this is so Popular and common.\n\n404\n00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:58.737\nBut just to show you,\nthere is things that you could take,\n\n405\n00:23:58.737 --> 00:24:00.586\nthat VLOOKUP that we did\nwith our commission rate.\n\n406\n00:24:00.586 --> 00:24:04.871\nSo nothing different here,\njust looking up our commission rate, and\n\n407\n00:24:04.871 --> 00:24:08.659\nthen we'll use that cell to go ahead and\ncalculate the total.\n\n408\n00:24:08.659 --> 00:24:09.828\nSo what did I do?\n\n409\n00:24:09.828 --> 00:24:12.951\nI looked this value up in this column.\n\n410\n00:24:12.951 --> 00:24:15.541\nIn this column,\nwell what is our commission?\n\n411\n00:24:15.541 --> 00:24:18.769\nWell that would be the sales\ntimes the commission rate.\n\n412\n00:24:18.769 --> 00:24:23.450\nSo, I put that in one column,\nand then over here my\n\n413\n00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:28.354\ntotal is just taking\nthe commission plus the sales,\n\n414\n00:24:28.354 --> 00:24:32.712\nso you should end up getting $165,okay.\n\n415\n00:24:32.712 --> 00:24:35.764\nBasic calculations that people can do.\n\n416\n00:24:35.764 --> 00:24:38.896\nWell, you could, there is nothing\nwrong in breaking up with columns\n\n417\n00:24:38.896 --> 00:24:41.488\nwe've talked about this in\nmany other episodes of like,\n\n418\n00:24:41.488 --> 00:24:43.554\nit's sometimes nice to\nbe a able to see that.\n\n419\n00:24:43.554 --> 00:24:44.423\nWhat is the commission rate?\n\n420\n00:24:44.423 --> 00:24:46.908\nWhat was the actual commission?\n\n421\n00:24:46.908 --> 00:24:52.358\nAnd then what was the total payout to that\nparticular sales rep or what have you?\n\n422\n00:24:52.358 --> 00:24:57.254\nWe just pull all together,\nyou can say, hey this is the cut,\n\n423\n00:24:57.254 --> 00:25:00.137\nthis is the sales, this is our pay.\n\n424\n00:25:00.137 --> 00:25:02.203\nWell, what's their pay?\n\n425\n00:25:02.203 --> 00:25:06.757\nTheir pay is their commission, their\ncommission rate times their sales and\n\n426\n00:25:06.757 --> 00:25:11.088\nthen you add that back up and save, and\nthen you can take that and do like,\n\n427\n00:25:11.088 --> 00:25:13.317\none point whatever the commission.\n\n428\n00:25:13.317 --> 00:25:17.884\nI was always taught the other way,\nyou take this, you multiply it, and\n\n429\n00:25:17.884 --> 00:25:19.190\nthen add it back in.\n\n430\n00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:21.187\nThat's how I was always taught,\n\n431\n00:25:21.187 --> 00:25:22.991\nwhich way were you taught?\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n432\n00:25:22.991 --> 00:25:26.205\nI'm not sure which way I\nwas taught explicitly.\n\n433\n00:25:26.205 --> 00:25:29.480\nLet me rephrase that,\nI don't know if I was told the second way.\n\n434\n00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:32.846\nI know for a fact I was talk just\nlike you, you take all right so\n\n435\n00:25:32.846 --> 00:25:35.835\nhow do you calculate interest effectively?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n436\n00:25:35.835 --> 00:25:39.966\nYou take what you have, you multiple by\nthe percentage and that's what you, but\n\n437\n00:25:39.966 --> 00:25:42.109\nnow you gotta add it back to the original.\n\n438\n00:25:42.109 --> 00:25:46.319\nBut then some way along the line I always\ngo, cool that's a percentage one, dot, and\n\n439\n00:25:46.319 --> 00:25:48.615\nthen I just put that\npercentage after the dot.\n\n440\n00:25:48.615 --> 00:25:53.084\nAnd then if it's more than one,\nright if it's 150%, you just add them and\n\n441\n00:25:53.084 --> 00:25:55.135\nyou multiply that by the risk.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n442\n00:25:55.135 --> 00:25:59.772\nI don't know where I was taught\nin school or what happened,\n\n443\n00:25:59.772 --> 00:26:06.479\nit was way further down the line where\nI'm like but that's, that's faster.\n\n444\n00:26:06.479 --> 00:26:11.183\n[LAUGH] It's just one of those things\nthat you learn a certain way and\n\n445\n00:26:11.183 --> 00:26:12.704\nyou stay in that way.\n\n446\n00:26:12.704 --> 00:26:15.663\nSo, anyway, but\nsorry little bit of attention,\n\n447\n00:26:15.663 --> 00:26:19.615\ndidn't know if you ever if you're\never felt that or felt that way.\n\n448\n00:26:19.615 --> 00:26:24.767\nBut back in here, the reason I said\nthat is cuz I'm doing that thing\n\n449\n00:26:24.767 --> 00:26:30.934\nlike multiply this and then add it back\nin and right here, this is exactly that.\n\n450\n00:26:30.934 --> 00:26:35.996\nIt's saying in these outer parentheses,\nthat's like saying take\n\n451\n00:26:35.996 --> 00:26:42.143\nthe commission rate and take the sales,\ntimes that together and then add the B5.\n\n452\n00:26:42.143 --> 00:26:46.347\nThe reason I'm also talking about this is\ncause this is the order of operations.\n\n453\n00:26:46.347 --> 00:26:50.115\nPlease excuse my dear Aunt Sally,\ndefinitely watch those basic functions\n\n454\n00:26:50.115 --> 00:26:52.458\nvideos or\nepisodes if you haven't seen them.\n\n455\n00:26:52.458 --> 00:26:56.946\nSo I have to do this first and\nthen add it back in,\n\n456\n00:26:56.946 --> 00:27:02.240\nwell here's my sales but\nthe commissary is the lookup.\n\n457\n00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:06.377\nThat lookup is here give me\nthe percentage then times\n\n458\n00:27:06.377 --> 00:27:10.523\nup to the sales do all that,\nadd it back in the sales.\n\n459\n00:27:10.523 --> 00:27:14.545\nAnd so it looks a little scary\nwhen you bundle all together,\n\n460\n00:27:14.545 --> 00:27:18.648\nbut you just have to break it\ndown into those basic formulas or\n\n461\n00:27:18.648 --> 00:27:23.645\nthe equations that you had to do back\nin school and calculating interest.\n\n462\n00:27:23.645 --> 00:27:26.450\nThat's exactly what you're doing okay?\n\n463\n00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:27.933\nCan you put it all together?\n\n464\n00:27:27.933 --> 00:27:30.621\nSure.\n\n465\n00:27:30.621 --> 00:27:33.774\nShould you break up in curves,\nthat's your choice, okay.\n\n466\n00:27:33.774 --> 00:27:37.914\nIt's which way, and\nwhat you need the data to say,\n\n467\n00:27:37.914 --> 00:27:41.107\nthat's always the biggest part of it.\n\n468\n00:27:41.107 --> 00:27:48.005\nSo, those are my few examples of vertical\nlookup in, to me, it's simplistic format.\n\n469\n00:27:48.005 --> 00:27:52.294\nJust remember that the table array,\nit always starts at one.\n\n470\n00:27:52.294 --> 00:27:57.185\nAnd the table array's leftmost\ncolumn must match with what you're\n\n471\n00:27:57.185 --> 00:27:59.771\nlooking up in that first argument.\n\n472\n00:27:59.771 --> 00:28:02.255\nSo as long as you keep that,\nin your ascending order,\n\n473\n00:28:02.255 --> 00:28:05.571\nif you're doing approximate match\nmake sure it's sorted ascending,\n\n474\n00:28:05.571 --> 00:28:09.632\nyou have your array, everything matches\nand other than that you'll be fine, right?\n\n475\n00:28:09.632 --> 00:28:15.184\nIt's simple until you get more advanced.\n&gt;&gt; Well there you have it ladies and\n\n476\n00:28:15.184 --> 00:28:15.905\ngentlemen.\n\n477\n00:28:15.905 --> 00:28:19.520\nSome key words of advice cuz you could\ndefinitely overlook some of those small\n\n478\n00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:22.859\nnuanced behaviors whenever you're\nusing the function dialogue box or\n\n479\n00:28:22.859 --> 00:28:24.266\nreading the documentation.\n\n480\n00:28:24.266 --> 00:28:28.021\nBut I will take a different stance on\nwill you add them all together but\n\n481\n00:28:28.021 --> 00:28:29.202\ndifferent columns?\n\n482\n00:28:29.202 --> 00:28:31.562\nIf you're just starting to\nlearn a function, right,\n\n483\n00:28:31.562 --> 00:28:34.591\nyou're kind of seeing how it works,\nI recommend different columns,\n\n484\n00:28:34.591 --> 00:28:38.317\nbecause if you get unexpected results it's\neasier to trace where things went wrong.\n\n485\n00:28:38.317 --> 00:28:41.944\nOnce you do that,\nthen combine them mainly because,\n\n486\n00:28:41.944 --> 00:28:46.227\nmaybe you're saving some space or\nmaybe you just got use to it.\n\n487\n00:28:46.227 --> 00:28:49.642\nJust makes things easier,\njust to see if things go all right,\n\n488\n00:28:49.642 --> 00:28:52.085\nespecially as things become more complex.\n\n489\n00:28:52.085 --> 00:28:55.476\nMaybe you're just doing something\nfairly simplistic, like here,\n\n490\n00:28:55.476 --> 00:28:57.996\njust put them all together and\nthat should be fine.\n\n491\n00:28:57.996 --> 00:29:02.837\nBut, now Vonne, before we head out of here\nany final words of wisdom, parting advice\n\n492\n00:29:02.837 --> 00:29:06.514\nfor us, before we shut it down?\n&gt;&gt; It's just, you've triggered something\n\n493\n00:29:06.514 --> 00:29:09.448\nin me, because we've done episodes\non like trace dependence, and\n\n494\n00:29:09.448 --> 00:29:11.256\nwhere you can actually find your errors.\n\n495\n00:29:11.256 --> 00:29:15.165\nDefinitely watch those episodes in this\nseries, it's where you're like going and\n\n496\n00:29:15.165 --> 00:29:16.112\nformula auditing.\n\n497\n00:29:16.112 --> 00:29:19.825\nSo there's a couple things and when you\nbreaking up into the different columns,\n\n498\n00:29:19.825 --> 00:29:21.966\nit can help you trace\nwhere your problems are.\n\n499\n00:29:21.966 --> 00:29:26.073\nSo, that's all,\njust another reference to another episode.\n\n500\n00:29:26.073 --> 00:29:29.061\nSo, we cross reference also,\nbut that's it.\n\n501\n00:29:29.061 --> 00:29:29.941\n&gt;&gt; Well I'll tell you what,\n\n502\n00:29:29.941 --> 00:29:31.902\nyou definitely don't want to\nmiss any of those episodes.\n\n503\n00:29:31.902 --> 00:29:33.628\nSo definitely check out the library, and\n\n504\n00:29:33.628 --> 00:29:36.547\ndefinitely come on back as we continue\nour look into Excel functions.\n\n505\n00:29:36.547 --> 00:29:38.736\nBut for now we're gonna go ahead and\nget on out of here.\n\n506\n00:29:38.736 --> 00:29:41.527\nSo signing out for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n507\n00:29:41.527 --> 00:29:42.415\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n508\n00:29:42.415 --> 00:29:45.098\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n509\n00:29:45.098 -->

OfficeProTv.\n\n3\n00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.490\nI'm you host Justin Dennison, and\nboy do I have a treat for you.\n\n4\n00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:19.584\nThat's right, more Excel functions.\n\n5\n00:00:19.584 --> 00:00:22.775\nAnd what we're gonna be\ntalking about HLOOKUP today.\n\n6\n00:00:22.775 --> 00:00:25.419\nAnd here to help us along in that\nvery endeavor is Ms. Vonne Smith.\n\n7\n00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:27.271\nHow are you doing today, Vonne?\n&gt;&gt; Doing pretty good, how are you?\n\n8\n00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:28.777\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic.\n\n9\n00:00:28.777 --> 00:00:32.950\nHLOOKUP, we talked about\nVLOOKUP in a previous episode.\n\n10\n00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.209\nI wanna go out on a limb here,\nisn't just VLOOKUP the horizontal?\n\n11\n00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:36.784\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n12\n00:00:36.784 --> 00:00:39.277\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n13\n00:00:39.277 --> 00:00:40.575\n&gt;&gt; You got it, yes.\n\n14\n00:00:40.575 --> 00:00:43.844\nSo V for vertical, H for horizontal.\n\n15\n00:00:43.844 --> 00:00:49.541\nAnd it works pretty much the exact same\nway, you just have to just [SOUND].\n\n16\n00:00:49.541 --> 00:00:52.626\nYou've just got to turn\nyourself over on your side and\n\n17\n00:00:52.626 --> 00:00:55.430\nstart going horizontal\nrather than vertical.\n\n18\n00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.310\nSo definitely do check\nout the vertical lookup,\n\n19\n00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.720\nif you've never done lookups before,\nand like, what is this HLOOKUP?\n\n20\n00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.297\nNow the thing is, how many times is\nour information going to be organized,\n\n21\n00:01:07.297 --> 00:01:11.737\nmore of like going horizontally,\nthan going vertically?\n\n22\n00:01:11.737 --> 00:01:15.758\nIt kind of like,\nit kind of defies the law of Excel.\n\n23\n00:01:15.758 --> 00:01:20.752\nBut that being said, it doesn't not exist.\n\n24\n00:01:20.752 --> 00:01:23.126\nWow, I feel like we're back\nin our not episode, right?\n\n25\n00:01:23.126 --> 00:01:27.440\n[LAUGH] Yeah, so\nit's more of just a different orientation.\n\n26\n00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.866\nSo instead of looking at\nthe leftmost column and\n\n27\n00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:33.605\nthen returning a column at the index,\n\n28\n00:01:33.605 --> 00:01:38.840\nyou're going to look at the topmost\nrow and then return a row reference.\n\n29\n00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.490\nThat's exactly what we're going to do.\n\n30\n00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.910\nSo we're gonna start off\nby just thinking about it.\n\n31\n00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.310\nHow would we do this?\n\n32\n00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.200\nWhat would I do as a human of\nthinking about this information?\n\n33\n00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.380\nSo I have some information, and\nwe are mixing things up today, yep.\n\n34\n00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.921\nWe're gonna be talking about dogs.\n\n35\n00:01:55.921 --> 00:01:58.562\nI know, who would've thunk it?\n\n36\n00:01:58.562 --> 00:02:01.550\nSo we don't have cat names,\nwe have dog names.\n\n37\n00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.050\nI guess, you see I didn't tell\nyou all that they were dogs,\n\n38\n00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.400\nyou probably would've\nthought they were cats here.\n\n39\n00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.088\nBut anyways, how about we go ahead and\njump down into our Excel workbook.\n\n40\n00:02:08.088 --> 00:02:09.664\nAnd here we go, yes.\n\n41\n00:02:09.664 --> 00:02:13.399\nAnd it actually does say dog.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, if you decide that's my cat\n\n42\n00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:16.976\nWolfie, I don't like,\nyou got that wrong, it's wrong.\n\n43\n00:02:16.976 --> 00:02:18.229\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n44\n00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.852\n&gt;&gt; Quick side note,\n\n45\n00:02:18.852 --> 00:02:20.093\nI also had a dog Poochie.\n&gt;&gt; Did\n\n46\n00:02:20.093 --> 00:02:20.840\nyou?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I did.\n\n47\n00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.807\n&gt;&gt; Well, I remember Poochie as,\n\n48\n00:02:22.807 --> 00:02:26.976\ndo you remember like the little\ndog like the toys and everything.\n\n49\n00:02:26.976 --> 00:02:31.180\nI think that's what we named her after,\nI was really small, but yeah.\n\n50\n00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.750\nPoochie and\nDaffodil were my dogs growing up.\n\n51\n00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.460\n&gt;&gt; Key take away though,\n\n52\n00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.306\ndon't name a cat Wolfie.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n53\n00:02:38.306 --> 00:02:38.904\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n54\n00:02:38.904 --> 00:02:40.442\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's funny you started laughing,\n\n55\n00:02:40.442 --> 00:02:42.372\nI'm just kind of like what happened,\nwhat did I say?\n\n56\n00:02:42.372 --> 00:02:44.969\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You didn't say anything.\n\n57\n00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:45.469\nYou're like, you would have known.\n\n58\n00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:46.536\nI was like, yeah, whatever.\n\n59\n00:02:46.536 --> 00:02:48.832\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So yeah,\n\n60\n00:02:48.832 --> 00:02:51.721\nyou threw me off there a little\nbit kind of like how it threw.\n\n61\n00:02:51.721 --> 00:02:56.349\nYou might not have your information all\norganized like this all the time to where,\n\n62\n00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.449\nbut we could like lookup January and\ngo across with it.\n\n63\n00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:04.657\nBut what we really wanna do is, we wanna\nlookup the dog and find out their,\n\n64\n00:03:04.657 --> 00:03:10.374\nwe'll just say the amount of milk-bones\nthat they ate this month or something.\n\n65\n00:03:10.374 --> 00:03:17.339\nSo if I asked you, hey,\nhow many bones did Albert eat in March?\n\n66\n00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:22.074\nIt's a dog, so just keyword dog.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n67\n00:03:22.074 --> 00:03:25.130\nAlbert in March, 79.\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n68\n00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.510\nhow did you do that?\n&gt;&gt; So I looked up the dog's name first.\n\n69\n00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.340\nSo I went to Albert, so that's the column.\n\n70\n00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.646\nAnd in that column I was like,\nJanuary, February, March.\n\n71\n00:03:33.646 --> 00:03:36.094\nSo it's the third one down, so that's 79.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n72\n00:03:36.094 --> 00:03:38.303\nI'm going to point out something one.\n\n73\n00:03:38.303 --> 00:03:39.466\nYou said third one down., right?\n\n74\n00:03:39.466 --> 00:03:41.231\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I did.\n\n75\n00:03:41.231 --> 00:03:44.834\nAnd the reason being is I thought\nabout this when you said something.\n\n76\n00:03:44.834 --> 00:03:48.750\nWe're gonna go by rows, I was like,\nthat means you can't have the headers.\n\n77\n00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.774\nYou can't include the headers.\n&gt;&gt; Actually,\n\n78\n00:03:50.774 --> 00:03:53.324\nyou have to include the headers.\n&gt;&gt; Excel,\n\n79\n00:03:53.324 --> 00:03:57.483\nwhy do you torture me like such nonsense?\n\n80\n00:03:57.483 --> 00:03:58.690\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right?\n\n81\n00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.428\nYeah, and\nthat's where it has to have this,\n\n82\n00:04:01.428 --> 00:04:04.612\ncuz think about just like vertical lookup,\nright?\n\n83\n00:04:04.612 --> 00:04:06.279\nWhat was the thing that we\nsaid the thing that we said?\n\n84\n00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:11.062\nThe thing that you're looking up,\nso I said you look to this cell.\n\n85\n00:04:11.062 --> 00:04:13.648\nI told you which one, but\nyou look to the cell.\n\n86\n00:04:13.648 --> 00:04:15.720\nYou said, Albert.\n\n87\n00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.030\nWhere is Albert?\n\n88\n00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.590\nAlbert is up here.\n\n89\n00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.300\nThese two things have to match.\n\n90\n00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.520\nSo our table array has to include this.\n\n91\n00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.953\nJust like,\nremember when we were looking at the cats?\n\n92\n00:04:28.953 --> 00:04:30.585\nWe were looking at Bishop?\n\n93\n00:04:30.585 --> 00:04:33.002\nAnd then the column,\nthe very first column,\n\n94\n00:04:33.002 --> 00:04:36.780\nit had to have Bishop in that\nfirst column, didn't it?\n\n95\n00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.560\nSo turn that on its side,\nwhat has to be in that top row?\n\n96\n00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.600\nIt has to be the item\nthat you're looking for.\n\n97\n00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.220\n&gt;&gt; For further clarity,\n\n98\n00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.410\nI'm talking about the counting.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n99\n00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:49.650\n&gt;&gt; So do you include\n\n100\n00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.445\nthose in the counting?\n&gt;&gt; Did we do it in the VLOOKUP?\n\n101\n00:04:53.445 --> 00:04:56.583\n&gt;&gt; Yes?\n\n102\n00:04:56.583 --> 00:04:59.103\n&gt;&gt; Yes?\n\n103\n00:04:59.103 --> 00:05:04.474\nIt's one of those things.where, even\nthough your're kind of twisting your head,\n\n104\n00:05:04.474 --> 00:05:08.220\nmy mind works differently if\nthings are arranged this way.\n\n105\n00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.869\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\n\n106\n00:05:08.869 --> 00:05:10.822\nthat's why we're used to going this way.\n\n107\n00:05:10.822 --> 00:05:13.350\nIt's hard, yeah, but we did.\n\n108\n00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.479\nRemember the first column was one,\nremember you actually read that.\n\n109\n00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:21.479\nSo I'll remind you that you read it,\nthat first column was column number one.\n\n110\n00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.649\nSo we went one, two, three, four.\n\n111\n00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:27.110\nSo yeah, it's the third column over.\n\n112\n00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.199\nJust like when you said,\nthat's why I wanted to point this out,\n\n113\n00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:31.689\nbecause I think it's a really a good one,\nyou said it's the third one down.\n\n114\n00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:35.515\nWell, the third one down from here.\n\n115\n00:05:35.515 --> 00:05:37.115\nIt's one, two, three.\n\n116\n00:05:37.115 --> 00:05:37.756\nThat's the third one.\n\n117\n00:05:37.756 --> 00:05:39.810\nBut if you counted this as one.\n\n118\n00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.880\nWell, actually, we're on Albert.\n\n119\n00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.880\nThat's one, two, three, four.\n\n120\n00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:46.926\nYeah, exactly.\n\n121\n00:05:46.926 --> 00:05:50.975\nSo that's the whole think like a human,\nthink like Excel.\n\n122\n00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:55.620\nAnd it is like vertical lookups,\nwhere we included that as column one.\n\n123\n00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.689\nNow we just had to flip it to say row one,\n\n124\n00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:02.230\nis what we're looking up and\nit has to match.\n\n125\n00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:03.470\nJust like the VLOOKUP,\n\n126\n00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:09.120\nwhere we did the first name versus\nthe last name in the cats, right?\n\n127\n00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.950\nAnd that they're table array,\neven though it's all in the same one,\n\n128\n00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.900\nyou had to have the left-most column\nbe the value that you're looking up,\n\n129\n00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.750\nit's the same thing on the horizontal.\n\n130\n00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.860\nWhatever you're looking up\nhas to be that first one.\n\n131\n00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:27.930\nWhether that is a call or\na data table header, or not.\n\n132\n00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.880\nBut most likely, it probably will.\n\n133\n00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.830\nSo just keep all of that in mind, and\nI I'm right there with you, it's hard.\n\n134\n00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.220\nIt's like yeah, just turn it over.\n\n135\n00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.160\nYour brain doesn't translate.\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying to sit here and\n\n136\n00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.500\nthink of why that is,\nbecause I was in the last episode and\n\n137\n00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.050\nI was like, yeah,\nthat just made sense to me.\n\n138\n00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.560\nBut when it's a column header,\nI'm usually like, I don't know.\n\n139\n00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.900\nIt's weird.\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n140\n00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.330\n&gt;&gt; It just seems weird.\n\n141\n00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.090\nIt's exactly the same thing.\n\n142\n00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.352\nYou had this printed on a sheet\nof paper and you went, [SOUND].\n\n143\n00:07:03.352 --> 00:07:04.922\nThen it's exactly the same thing.\n\n144\n00:07:04.922 --> 00:07:08.119\nBut I would probably\nmess this one up a lot.\n\n145\n00:07:08.119 --> 00:07:09.551\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, and\n\n146\n00:07:09.551 --> 00:07:12.995\nthis is where it's difficult, okay?\n\n147\n00:07:12.995 --> 00:07:15.855\nAnd we just filmed this like,\n[LAUGH] 15 minutes ago.\n\n148\n00:07:15.855 --> 00:07:17.819\nSo it's not that long.\n\n149\n00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:24.837\nWhy don't we go ahead and\ndo the actual function and go though it.\n\n150\n00:07:24.837 --> 00:07:29.117\nThe same thing with that false and\ntrue of do you want an exact match, or\n\n151\n00:07:29.117 --> 00:07:31.088\ndo you want an approximation?\n\n152\n00:07:31.088 --> 00:07:34.248\nSame thing holds true for HLOOKUPS.\n\n153\n00:07:34.248 --> 00:07:37.742\nI'm just going to go ahead and\nuse the falls for all of our examples,\n\n154\n00:07:37.742 --> 00:07:39.226\ncuz I do want an exact match.\n\n155\n00:07:39.226 --> 00:07:43.379\nAgain, he practicing back over is that\nVLOOKUP, but they do work the same.\n\n156\n00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:44.893\nSo definitely watch\nboth of these episodes.\n\n157\n00:07:44.893 --> 00:07:46.222\nSo let's do it.\n\n158\n00:07:46.222 --> 00:07:49.095\nSo where we want the answer to go into?\n\n159\n00:07:49.095 --> 00:07:52.031\nWe go ahead and\ninsert our function dialog box.\n\n160\n00:07:52.031 --> 00:07:56.072\nI still like for this one, I do like to\ngo ahead and go through the dialog box.\n\n161\n00:07:56.072 --> 00:07:58.427\nWhat am I looking up, okay?\n\n162\n00:07:58.427 --> 00:08:01.611\nThe value that's gonna be found\nin the first row of the table.\n\n163\n00:08:01.611 --> 00:08:05.254\nSo there's another one that was trying to\ntell us that you gotta have these match.\n\n164\n00:08:05.254 --> 00:08:08.920\nWe're looking to this dog or\nthis cell, really.\n\n165\n00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.188\nWhat is a table array?\n\n166\n00:08:12.188 --> 00:08:15.136\nOkay, the table array\nis what I'm looking up.\n\n167\n00:08:15.136 --> 00:08:22.520\nThat first row needs to be what\nwill match in a lookup value.\n\n168\n00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:30.720\nThere we go, the row index, and it does\nsay right here the first row is row one.\n\n169\n00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.941\nOkay, so let's just go, don't close that.\n\n170\n00:08:32.941 --> 00:08:34.602\n[LAUGH] Zoom back out.\n\n171\n00:08:34.602 --> 00:08:37.231\nWe want one, two, three, four,\n\n172\n00:08:37.231 --> 00:08:42.180\nbecause we're returning March,\nso that would be four.\n\n173\n00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:46.690\nOkay, we do want this\nto be not with a queue.\n\n174\n00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:50.830\nWe want this to be false so it does return\nan exact match cuz we're doing text.\n\n175\n00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:52.330\nSo we click OK.\n\n176\n00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.820\nAnd, yep, that's 79.\n\n177\n00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:59.561\nSo if we typed in Beeboo, so\nwe go ahead and bring that back Beeboo,\n\n178\n00:08:59.561 --> 00:09:02.623\ndid 104, all of those types of things.\n\n179\n00:09:02.623 --> 00:09:05.450\nSo it's the exact same\nthing just flipped around.\n\n180\n00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:11.086\nSo there is the horizontal lookup.\n\n181\n00:09:11.086 --> 00:09:14.620\nHey, other examples.\n\n182\n00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:20.095\nSo now this is one where,\nthis example is like I want to find each\n\n183\n00:09:20.095 --> 00:09:25.750\ndog's total bones eaten in March.\n\n184\n00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:28.878\nWell now the information\nis going this way, right?\n\n185\n00:09:28.878 --> 00:09:32.340\nAnd here's March, so\nI want all of this for each dog, but\n\n186\n00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:37.510\nnotice they're not in the same order,\nthey're all kinda mix matched.\n\n187\n00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.950\nI'd like to go ahead and\nbring this through.\n\n188\n00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:42.600\nSame thing,\nyou're just gonna absolute reference this.\n\n189\n00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.660\nAnd this might be a reason like maybe\nyour information is this way and\n\n190\n00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.860\nyou wanna turn it around and\nbring it down this way.\n\n191\n00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:53.880\nYou can do that, you just have\nto turn the orientation around.\n\n192\n00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:59.290\nSo let's go ahead and write it out,\nI'll just zoom out just a slight bit.\n\n193\n00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:03.120\nLet's go to the insert function,\nhorizontal lookup,\n\n194\n00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:09.790\ncuz I am looking up this cell, I'm looking\nto Albert, so that's what I wanna look up.\n\n195\n00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:12.710\nWhere am I looking up this information?\n\n196\n00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:16.740\nThat first row is the one\nthat has that lookup value.\n\n197\n00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.470\nSo here's my table array.\n\n198\n00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:19.708\nGonna go ahead and\n\n199\n00:10:19.708 --> 00:10:23.360\nabsolute reference this because I know\nI'm gonna wanna keep the table locked.\n\n200\n00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.580\nDon't ever leave that table\nwhen I'm copying down.\n\n201\n00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:28.780\nWhat is the row index?\n\n202\n00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:33.290\nWe know one, two, three, four.\n\n203\n00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:37.728\nFour, we're going to\nreturn the exact lookup.\n\n204\n00:10:37.728 --> 00:10:39.440\nWe click OK and\n\n205\n00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:44.340\nthen we just double-click, send it on\ndown and then I've brought my stuff out.\n\n206\n00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:50.340\nNothing different here besides just\nabsolute referencing the table.\n\n207\n00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:51.990\nSo pretty cool.\n\n208\n00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:56.390\nI wanted to throw in a little\ntidbit in this little section\n\n209\n00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:59.720\ncuz this is kind of a fun thing.\n\n210\n00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.580\nThese are going across, right?\n\n211\n00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:05.911\nWhat if I want those and I wanna copy\nit but I wanna paste it turning down?\n\n212\n00:11:05.911 --> 00:11:08.200\nYou know this little trick, Justin?\n&gt;&gt; I don't but\n\n213\n00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.624\nthis is something that you and I talked\nabout the other, I was like wait a minute.\n\n214\n00:11:11.624 --> 00:11:14.050\nIt was funny,\nI was just thinking about this.\n\n215\n00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:16.859\nThat you could use this to rearrange data.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n216\n00:11:16.859 --> 00:11:17.533\n&gt;&gt; And vertically and\n\n217\n00:11:17.533 --> 00:11:18.448\nhorizontally.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n218\n00:11:18.448 --> 00:11:20.390\nnow that's with the function, correct?\n\n219\n00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:21.440\nLike the actual information.\n\n220\n00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.380\nBut just copying and\npasting, if I take this and\n\n221\n00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:28.870\njust regular copy, and\nI'm gonna just move over here for now.\n\n222\n00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:30.040\nAnd I wanna come here.\n\n223\n00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.190\nLet me actually move over just\na little bit more so you can see it.\n\n224\n00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:37.785\nDon't just paste, if you're going to\nPaste Special, I'm going up here to do it.\n\n225\n00:11:37.785 --> 00:11:39.968\nIf you go to the Paste Special\ndialogue box,\n\n226\n00:11:39.968 --> 00:11:42.940\nthere's this little button\nwhich says transpose.\n\n227\n00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:44.858\nSo if you click this little check box and\n\n228\n00:11:44.858 --> 00:11:48.709\nclick OK, then it actually [SOUND] turns\nit on the other side which is kinda fun.\n\n229\n00:11:48.709 --> 00:11:51.001\nIt's a cute little one, it's neat, but\n\n230\n00:11:51.001 --> 00:11:54.026\nthat's where it's going to\nchange the orientation.\n\n231\n00:11:54.026 --> 00:11:56.695\nSo you could take something that goes\nacross and paste it downwards, or\n\n232\n00:11:56.695 --> 00:11:59.064\nyou can take something that's\ndownwards and paste it across.\n\n233\n00:11:59.064 --> 00:12:00.820\nSo, a little fun little trick.\n\n234\n00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.820\nDo you have a question?\n\n235\n00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.754\n[CROSSTALK].\n&gt;&gt; I have a question but\n\n236\n00:12:06.754 --> 00:12:08.740\nit's totally disjointed from this.\n\n237\n00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.470\nJust remind me.\n\n238\n00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:13.106\nI'll ask you more questions about\nwhat you just did here shortly.\n\n239\n00:12:13.106 --> 00:12:13.885\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n240\n00:12:13.885 --> 00:12:15.881\n&gt;&gt; But I was like [SOUND] wait a minute.\n\n241\n00:12:15.881 --> 00:12:16.508\nWait a minute.\n\n242\n00:12:16.508 --> 00:12:17.878\nI gotta get back on task.\n&gt;&gt; Okay [LAUGH].\n\n243\n00:12:17.878 --> 00:12:19.202\n&gt;&gt; So do carry on.\n\n244\n00:12:19.202 --> 00:12:21.035\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so it's more of an internal like,\n\n245\n00:12:21.035 --> 00:12:22.580\nI could do this, and I could do this.\n\n246\n00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.770\nWhich is hopefully what you\nguys are doing out there.\n\n247\n00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:27.282\nI was like I could see where\nI could totally do this.\n\n248\n00:12:27.282 --> 00:12:32.510\nSo there you go,\nlittle Easter egg in this episode for you.\n\n249\n00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:36.460\nSo now dog with match,\nthis is just trying to show you, yes,\n\n250\n00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:39.330\nthis is an H lookup, you could totally\ndo the same thing with a V lookup, okay?\n\n251\n00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:43.290\nBut just trying to give you different\nexamples of where you can kinda pull these\n\n252\n00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:44.580\nthings together.\n\n253\n00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:49.775\nSo what I wanna do here is I want to\nbe able to type in a dog's name and\n\n254\n00:12:49.775 --> 00:12:54.888\nthen if I change the month then I\nwant to change what the value is.\n\n255\n00:12:54.888 --> 00:13:01.186\nBut if I change the month then that's\nbasically saying I wanna change the four,\n\n256\n00:13:01.186 --> 00:13:06.356\nright, Albert four March,\nI want that to now be instead of four,\n\n257\n00:13:06.356 --> 00:13:09.649\nI want it to be five,\nor I want it to be two.\n\n258\n00:13:09.649 --> 00:13:16.614\nSo, how can I make that\nrow reference change?\n\n259\n00:13:16.614 --> 00:13:19.923\nI'll do Justin, hm all right.\n\n260\n00:13:19.923 --> 00:13:24.320\nWe need to use the match function.\n\n261\n00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.770\nSo, if I do match, let's just do a quick\nreminder, I'm just gonna do it down here.\n\n262\n00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:29.655\nWhat does match do?\n\n263\n00:13:29.655 --> 00:13:35.949\nYour match is going to tell you what\nthe position is within a list reference.\n\n264\n00:13:35.949 --> 00:13:39.536\nSo we're going to just type in match.\n\n265\n00:13:39.536 --> 00:13:41.776\nAnd what is our first lookup value?\n\n266\n00:13:41.776 --> 00:13:45.660\nIt is going to be April, right?\n\n267\n00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:48.310\nThis particular cell that I've typed in.\n\n268\n00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:50.507\nWhat is the lookup array?\n\n269\n00:13:50.507 --> 00:13:52.400\nIt's right here.\n\n270\n00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.960\nAnd then I do want to be an exact match so\nI will choose 0,\n\n271\n00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.760\nand then I will close that.\n\n272\n00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:03.776\nSo April is 4, so if I change this\nto March, then this is 3, right?\n\n273\n00:14:03.776 --> 00:14:05.506\nSo that's a cool thing.\n\n274\n00:14:05.506 --> 00:14:11.466\nWell that looks like a number that I put\nright in with that horizontal lookup and\n\n275\n00:14:11.466 --> 00:14:13.010\nthat would work.\n\n276\n00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:14.594\nThat would be cool, so\nif we type in this and\n\n277\n00:14:14.594 --> 00:14:16.727\nthen type in that then we\ncould go ahead and change it.\n\n278\n00:14:16.727 --> 00:14:18.641\nYeah, perfect, let's go.\n\n279\n00:14:18.641 --> 00:14:22.740\nYeah, so is anybody going, hm, hold on?\n\n280\n00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:23.758\nI know, there's a gotcha.\n\n281\n00:14:23.758 --> 00:14:25.920\nReferencing right now.\n\n282\n00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.330\nI'm gonna come into here and\njust copy all of this now.\n\n283\n00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:33.550\nSo I will get it ready to\ngo with the Escape key for\n\n284\n00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:38.200\nwhen I pull in the horizontal lookup.\n\n285\n00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.613\nSo I'm looking up the dog's name.\n\n286\n00:14:40.613 --> 00:14:43.133\nMake sure you put your cursor in there.\n\n287\n00:14:43.133 --> 00:14:44.970\nChange the table array.\n\n288\n00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:47.420\nThat's the same one I want, okay.\n\n289\n00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.070\nWhat is the row index?\n\n290\n00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:52.000\nIt is the actual match.\n\n291\n00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.233\nWhere that's gonna return a number.\n\n292\n00:14:53.233 --> 00:14:55.610\nBut don't keep the equal sign in there.\n\n293\n00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:56.670\nMake sure you take that off.\n\n294\n00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:59.390\nSo that's three, okay?\n\n295\n00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:00.320\nThat looks good.\n\n296\n00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.774\nI do want it to be exact.\n\n297\n00:15:02.774 --> 00:15:07.153\nSo you click and you're like,\nyeah, that works, right?\n\n298\n00:15:07.153 --> 00:15:09.653\nWoofie for March.\n\n299\n00:15:09.653 --> 00:15:13.918\nWhat's wrong Justin?\n&gt;&gt; You're off by one, well,\n\n300\n00:15:13.918 --> 00:15:15.850\nbecause our brand.\n\n301\n00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:18.180\nYeah, you count, wait a minute.\n\n302\n00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:21.350\nWait a minute,\nbecause the header row is there.\n\n303\n00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:24.417\nYou actually need to go more.\n&gt;&gt; Correct,\n\n304\n00:15:24.417 --> 00:15:30.152\nbecause when we looked in our\nmatch function, we said here.\n\n305\n00:15:30.152 --> 00:15:34.413\nSo in this, January is one,\nFebruary two, three, four, five.\n\n306\n00:15:34.413 --> 00:15:37.701\nYeah, because within its own array,\n\n307\n00:15:37.701 --> 00:15:42.129\nwithin its own lookup\narray that's the position.\n\n308\n00:15:42.129 --> 00:15:46.785\nBut our table array, this is one.\n\n309\n00:15:46.785 --> 00:15:48.944\nSo yeah, it's off by one.\n\n310\n00:15:48.944 --> 00:15:52.330\nSo, what would I do to\nthis number of match?\n\n311\n00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:53.592\nWhat could I do?\n\n312\n00:15:53.592 --> 00:15:54.497\nJust,\n&gt;&gt; Add one.\n\n313\n00:15:54.497 --> 00:15:59.153\n&gt;&gt; Correct, so we're going to add one.\n\n314\n00:15:59.153 --> 00:16:03.034\nAnd since it did all of that first,\nright, find that, okay.\n\n315\n00:16:03.034 --> 00:16:08.058\nAnd then just add that together,\ncuz this match is just yielding a number,\n\n316\n00:16:08.058 --> 00:16:11.807\nso I don't have to worry about\nlike extra parenthesis or\n\n317\n00:16:11.807 --> 00:16:16.940\nanything like that, just add one more,\nand yeah, Woofie in March is 99.\n\n318\n00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:20.767\nSo if I change this to May, and\n\n319\n00:16:20.767 --> 00:16:25.369\nthen change this to Jaque, right?\n\n320\n00:16:25.369 --> 00:16:29.145\nThen, there you go, that's pretty cool.\n\n321\n00:16:29.145 --> 00:16:34.123\nAll right, so now you can kinda make a\nlittle bit more of dynamic lookup table by\n\n322\n00:16:34.123 --> 00:16:36.386\njust using the match function for,\n\n323\n00:16:36.386 --> 00:16:41.074\nin this sense since this is a horizontal\nlook up we change the route index.\n\n324\n00:16:41.074 --> 00:16:43.100\nNow Vonne, instead of adding that one,\n\n325\n00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.969\ncould we have just extended\nthat to include the word dog?\n\n326\n00:16:45.969 --> 00:16:49.001\nAnd then will that kind of take care, now,\n\n327\n00:16:49.001 --> 00:16:52.454\njust because we can,\nit's just a thought I had,\n\n328\n00:16:52.454 --> 00:16:57.945\nmight not be the best idea cuz you may\nget weird matches and some shenanigans.\n\n329\n00:16:57.945 --> 00:17:01.252\nBut would that produce the same result?\n&gt;&gt; I was hoping you'd ask that, and\n\n330\n00:17:01.252 --> 00:17:03.353\nI actually didn't prompt\nyou to ask that before.\n\n331\n00:17:03.353 --> 00:17:07.002\nCuz sometimes I'm like hey,\nask me this one question somewhere,\n\n332\n00:17:07.002 --> 00:17:11.059\njust a little behind the scenes magic,\nsometimes we do ask you to do that.\n\n333\n00:17:11.059 --> 00:17:13.768\nYes, but what if I typed\nin the word dog right here?\n\n334\n00:17:13.768 --> 00:17:19.086\nThen it would actually return dog,\nand that's not really what you want.\n\n335\n00:17:19.086 --> 00:17:25.292\nSo I would say, yeah, to be more precise\nin what I want, I would just use\n\n336\n00:17:25.292 --> 00:17:31.299\nthe match then add one to satisfy\nthe VLOOKUP function in all of that.\n\n337\n00:17:31.299 --> 00:17:36.010\nAnd just to throw something else out,\nwhat if I type it in wrong?\n\n338\n00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:38.298\nAll right,\nthis is the exact same thing, but\n\n339\n00:17:38.298 --> 00:17:40.657\nwhat I've done here is\nI've made drop downs.\n\n340\n00:17:40.657 --> 00:17:43.991\nAnd we actually reference that in another\nepisode, I don't remember which one right\n\n341\n00:17:43.991 --> 00:17:46.225\nnow, but I know you're like,\ncan't you do drop downs?\n\n342\n00:17:46.225 --> 00:17:49.785\nAnd like, yeah, that would totally\nwork to avoid spelling mistakes.\n\n343\n00:17:49.785 --> 00:17:54.301\nSo yeah, I could change this, and\nthen change this here and go forth, so\n\n344\n00:17:54.301 --> 00:17:57.114\nthe data validation, so\nhow to make lists and\n\n345\n00:17:57.114 --> 00:18:01.731\neverything that on the list by the way\nis over here, it's on the same one.\n\n346\n00:18:01.731 --> 00:18:06.535\nYou could just as easily put that on\nanother worksheet and then be able to\n\n347\n00:18:06.535 --> 00:18:11.917\nreference that somewhere else or be\nreferencing that in your data validation.\n\n348\n00:18:11.917 --> 00:18:16.290\nAnd throwing that altogether I think you\nasked this again in another episode,\n\n349\n00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:20.548\nwhat about if I don't wanna, what if\nmy table's on a different worksheet?\n\n350\n00:18:20.548 --> 00:18:22.063\nCan you do that?\n\n351\n00:18:22.063 --> 00:18:26.942\nTotally, I just have a really\nquick example right here to where\n\n352\n00:18:26.942 --> 00:18:28.977\nAlbert in March, right?\n\n353\n00:18:28.977 --> 00:18:34.478\nIt's 79, but if you look at this,\ndo you see how, where's the table?\n\n354\n00:18:34.478 --> 00:18:35.779\nWhere is this all coming from?\n\n355\n00:18:35.779 --> 00:18:41.513\nYeah I'm looking to C5 on this, but\nthen it's looking at the Dogs worksheet.\n\n356\n00:18:41.513 --> 00:18:44.160\nSee how it has that exclamation point?\n\n357\n00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:48.076\nSo the table array just\nlives on another worksheet,\n\n358\n00:18:48.076 --> 00:18:52.355\nso when you see this,\nyou always look for the sheet name.\n\n359\n00:18:52.355 --> 00:18:55.903\nAll the rest is the same,\njust four and false.\n\n360\n00:18:55.903 --> 00:18:59.875\nSo you could have ranges on\nall sorts of different places.\n\n361\n00:18:59.875 --> 00:19:04.537\nYou don't have to do all of these\nfunctions and looking up parts and\n\n362\n00:19:04.537 --> 00:19:08.878\nlike looking up, I mean,\ngrabbing actual cell references.\n\n363\n00:19:08.878 --> 00:19:12.306\nIt could be anywhere,\nyou just need to remember when you're in\n\n364\n00:19:12.306 --> 00:19:16.703\nthe Insert Function dialog box, just to\nshow you really quick, if I took this and\n\n365\n00:19:16.703 --> 00:19:19.829\nwanted to write the same thing,\nhere's the age lookup.\n\n366\n00:19:19.829 --> 00:19:23.831\nYeah, look here, table array,\ncursor in the field,\n\n367\n00:19:23.831 --> 00:19:27.572\nnavigate over, and\nit'll populate the syntax for\n\n368\n00:19:27.572 --> 00:19:32.098\nthat particular worksheet, and\nthen I could come over here,\n\n369\n00:19:32.098 --> 00:19:36.642\nnot that this makes any sense,\nso it's still gonna be wrong.\n\n370\n00:19:36.642 --> 00:19:40.710\nBut maybe my dog matches over here and\nevery, so\n\n371\n00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:43.870\nyou can just keep on going with this.\n\n372\n00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:46.747\nI knew it was gonna break,\ncuz it's not making any sense.\n\n373\n00:19:46.747 --> 00:19:53.027\nBut, you look at that sheet name,\ncell name or cell references.\n\n374\n00:19:53.027 --> 00:19:55.703\nSometimes this could be a name deranged.\n\n375\n00:19:55.703 --> 00:19:59.827\nThese are variations on\nevery single function.\n\n376\n00:19:59.827 --> 00:20:03.772\nWe talked about that name deranges,\naccessing different worksheets and\n\n377\n00:20:03.772 --> 00:20:05.627\nsome of our essentials episodes.\n\n378\n00:20:05.627 --> 00:20:09.117\nBut just keep that in mind as far as\njust go ahead and throw that in here,\n\n379\n00:20:09.117 --> 00:20:12.787\njust because it just popped in my brain\nwhen we were doing this episode, so\n\n380\n00:20:12.787 --> 00:20:14.639\nwanted to just let y'all know that.\n\n381\n00:20:14.639 --> 00:20:21.403\nBut that is HLOOKUP, you just gotta turn\naround and just keep the noggin, well,\n\n382\n00:20:21.403 --> 00:20:25.954\nfrom not going completely turned around.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n383\n00:20:25.954 --> 00:20:26.730\n&gt;&gt; Well, Vonne,\n\n384\n00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:30.676\nwho would've thought that just turning\nyour head like this can make things not\n\n385\n00:20:30.676 --> 00:20:31.931\nquite as intuitive, but\n\n386\n00:20:31.931 --> 00:20:35.307\nit definitely showed us some of\nthe things we need to be careful of.\n\n387\n00:20:35.307 --> 00:20:39.746\nIt's very similar to VLOOKUP, but\nbased on your respective data structure.\n\n388\n00:20:39.746 --> 00:20:42.002\nYou may have to use HLOOKUP\ninstead of VLOOKUP.\n\n389\n00:20:42.002 --> 00:20:44.667\nSo thank you so much for that and\nthank you for joining us but for\n\n390\n00:20:44.667 --> 00:20:46.627\nnow we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n391\n00:20:46.627 --> 00:20:49.319\nSo signing off for Office Pro TV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n392\n00:20:49.319 --> 00:20:49.953\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n393\n00:20:49.953 --> 00:20:51.772\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n394\n00:20:51.772 --> 00:20:56.701\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:17.220\nI'm your host Justin Dennison, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.326\nyou better not touch that dial because\nwe've got more Excel functions for you.\n\n5\n00:00:20.326 --> 00:00:23.015\nAnd in particular we're gonna\nbe looking at, well, LOOKUP.\n\n6\n00:00:23.015 --> 00:00:25.622\nLooking at LOOKUP,\nthere was a lot of looks in that sentence.\n\n7\n00:00:25.622 --> 00:00:29.048\nBut luckily we have someone who's gonna\nkeep things straight for us, the one,\n\n8\n00:00:29.048 --> 00:00:30.237\nthe only Miss Vonne Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:30.237 --> 00:00:31.217\nHow are you doing today Vonne?\n\n10\n00:00:31.217 --> 00:00:32.690\n&gt;&gt; I am doing wonderful, how are you?\n\n11\n00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.772\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic, and\nLOOKUP, I feel like this is\n\n12\n00:00:35.772 --> 00:00:39.469\na little bit of deja vu because we\ntalked about, up to this point.\n\n13\n00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:42.323\nWe've talked about HLOOKUP, VLOOKUP.\n\n14\n00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.347\nDo we just put them together and\ncall it LOOKUP?\n\n15\n00:00:45.347 --> 00:00:48.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\nit's a little weird, right?\n\n16\n00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:55.927\nAnd we have it after in the library in\nthe sequence after H and V lookups, why?\n\n17\n00:00:55.927 --> 00:00:58.391\nWell, just because [LAUGH].\n\n18\n00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:01.292\nFor one, it's an older function,\n\n19\n00:01:01.292 --> 00:01:07.060\nthis is actually the function\nthat came before V and H lookups.\n\n20\n00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.830\nSo it's like, so how is it different?\n\n21\n00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.800\nWhy do we have three of them?\n\n22\n00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.980\nWell you know what?\n\n23\n00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.370\nI think we need to just jump right into\nan example, just to get us started.\n\n24\n00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.871\nAnd I think it's gonna illustrate the\npoint of what this particular function by\n\n25\n00:01:20.871 --> 00:01:24.242\nitself, just LOOKUP, not an H or\na V, what it does, okay?\n\n26\n00:01:24.242 --> 00:01:26.296\nSo why don't we jump down in here and\n\n27\n00:01:26.296 --> 00:01:28.910\nJustin I'm going to ask\nyou some questions.\n\n28\n00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:34.828\nSo if I wanted you to tell\nme the name of an employee,\n\n29\n00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:38.419\ndon't look over here, CC6.\n\n30\n00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:43.149\n&gt;&gt; All right, so I come down this\ncolumn in employee ID and go over to,\n\n31\n00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.489\nI guess you want first name?\n\n32\n00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:46.870\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I'm sorry, yes first name.\n&gt;&gt; Cheeto.\n\n33\n00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.252\n&gt;&gt; Cheeto, yes.\n\n34\n00:01:48.252 --> 00:01:52.282\nAnd so what you just did, you just\nexplained the whole process of what\n\n35\n00:01:52.282 --> 00:01:55.775\nwe've done in a previous episode for\nthe vertical lookup.\n\n36\n00:01:55.775 --> 00:01:59.492\nOkay, so I just told you,\nso right over here\n\n37\n00:01:59.492 --> 00:02:04.450\njust as a reminder I asked you\nto look up this employee ID.\n\n38\n00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.640\nSo this particular cell.\n\n39\n00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.060\nSo when you did you said, all right.\n\n40\n00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.463\nThis is the value,\nyou came over to that column.\n\n41\n00:02:11.463 --> 00:02:17.287\nYou went down, and then you went over, and\nthen you returned the value of, Cheeto.\n\n42\n00:02:17.287 --> 00:02:19.870\nAnd that's a VLOOKUP, okay, great.\n\n43\n00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:30.020\nWhat if I asked you to tell me\nthe employee ID for the cat James?\n\n44\n00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.500\nWait, I don't think James is in there.\n\n45\n00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.180\nHold on, let me, [LAUGH], sorry.\n\n46\n00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.470\nHow about Bishop?\n\n47\n00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.760\nThere we go, how about Bishop?\n\n48\n00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.610\n&gt;&gt; All right, so if I were doing then I\nwould come over to the first name column,\n\n49\n00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.298\ncome down to Bishop, and then go over\nto the employee ID, which is CC3.\n\n50\n00:02:43.298 --> 00:02:46.109\n&gt;&gt; Correct, that is right.\n\n51\n00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.287\nThat is right, [LAUGH], keyword there.\n\n52\n00:02:49.287 --> 00:02:55.214\nYou remember the thing we talked about\nwith vertical lookups that was so\n\n53\n00:02:55.214 --> 00:02:56.309\nimportant?\n\n54\n00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:58.420\nWith vertical lookups, VLOOKUPs.\n\n55\n00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.720\nWe said that this particular value\nhad something to do with what?\n\n56\n00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.250\n&gt;&gt; So we had to select our subset column,\n\n57\n00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.620\ncuz the first column was essentially\nour reference column or whatever.\n\n58\n00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.333\n&gt;&gt; Yes, the very first column,\nthe look up value that we're looking up.\n\n59\n00:03:14.333 --> 00:03:18.011\n[LAUGH] How many times are we\ngonna say that today, a lot.\n\n60\n00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:23.041\nWe wanted the employee ID, so this lookup\n\n61\n00:03:23.041 --> 00:03:28.840\nvalue had to match or\nbe in the left most column.\n\n62\n00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.900\nThe very first column\nreference within a VLOOKUP.\n\n63\n00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.177\nAnd then you went over, correct?\n\n64\n00:03:36.177 --> 00:03:39.543\nWe went to the right, from here.\n\n65\n00:03:39.543 --> 00:03:43.160\nThe thing with vertical lookups,\n\n66\n00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:49.090\nyou can't go left,\nyou can't go the other way.\n\n67\n00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.080\nIt doesn't work that way,\nVLOOKUPs only start at the left hand side.\n\n68\n00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.627\nI don't know which way,\nand go to the right.\n\n69\n00:03:56.627 --> 00:03:58.840\nThat's the only thing it can do.\n\n70\n00:04:00.526 --> 00:04:04.101\nAll right, well that's great, but\n\n71\n00:04:04.101 --> 00:04:08.364\nin this sense of,\nI want to look up Bishop and\n\n72\n00:04:08.364 --> 00:04:14.143\nreturn the value of Bishop in\nthe same row in employee ID.\n\n73\n00:04:14.143 --> 00:04:15.416\nOk, so that's the thing.\n\n74\n00:04:15.416 --> 00:04:20.020\nWith lookups, you can go either direction,\ndoesn't matter.\n\n75\n00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:24.404\nYou can take something and\nlook it up in a right column and\n\n76\n00:04:24.404 --> 00:04:29.121\nreturn something in left\ncolumn relative to each other.\n\n77\n00:04:29.121 --> 00:04:33.140\nOkay, well, that's pretty cool,\nand that's exactly what it can do.\n\n78\n00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.027\nNow, remember I said that this is an older\nfunction, this came before the V and\n\n79\n00:04:38.027 --> 00:04:38.777\nH LOOKUPs.\n\n80\n00:04:38.777 --> 00:04:45.730\nSo if it came before it doesn't have as\nmany parameters, as much flexibility.\n\n81\n00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.335\nIt has some things that\nyou just can't get around.\n\n82\n00:04:50.335 --> 00:04:56.315\nAnd so that's what kind of lends itself\nto maybe not being as powerful as a V or\n\n83\n00:04:56.315 --> 00:04:57.770\nan H LOOKUP.\n\n84\n00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.280\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n85\n00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.700\nI'm just going to go ahead and tell you\nthat, a few things with the lookup.\n\n86\n00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:09.434\nYou have to have your ranges be equal,\nlike in size.\n\n87\n00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:14.390\nLike, I can't say look up this and\nthen also look up that.\n\n88\n00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.989\nLike, sorry, the returning column,\nor the second column,\n\n89\n00:05:18.989 --> 00:05:24.187\nwe're gonna call it a vector cuz that's\nwhat they call it in the function.\n\n90\n00:05:24.187 --> 00:05:27.730\nThey have to be the exact size.\n\n91\n00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.166\nNow I've done some examples where\nthey're not of the same size, and\n\n92\n00:05:30.166 --> 00:05:31.595\nI was like well it seems to keep working.\n\n93\n00:05:31.595 --> 00:05:35.439\nBut it's one of those like that\nwhole unforeseen errors those,\n\n94\n00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:40.279\nyou might get some weird results if it's\nnot the exact same amount of information\n\n95\n00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:41.721\nthat it's looking at.\n\n96\n00:05:41.721 --> 00:05:43.540\nSo, that's something to know.\n\n97\n00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.200\nThe other thing,\nremember with the vertical lookups,\n\n98\n00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.600\nwe could do that exact match.\n\n99\n00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.160\nThat last argument was we could put false.\n\n100\n00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.440\nAnd if we put false,\nthen it would return an exact match.\n\n101\n00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.950\nOtherwise, if it was true, or\n\n102\n00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.110\nadmitted, omitted, sorry,\nif it is left blank and\n\n103\n00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.730\nnot populated,\nthen it automatically defaults to true.\n\n104\n00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:08.693\nTrue means an approximate match.\n\n105\n00:06:08.693 --> 00:06:11.948\nThe whole like the tiered commission,\nI am referring to this episode\n\n106\n00:06:11.948 --> 00:06:15.440\nthat I'm assuming that you have watched,\nthe vertical lookup episode.\n\n107\n00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.140\nSo definitely check that\nout if you're like,\n\n108\n00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.790\nI don't know what you're talking about?\n\n109\n00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:19.720\nCheck that out too.\n\n110\n00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.883\nThat's something that a lookup\nby itself is always approximate.\n\n111\n00:06:25.883 --> 00:06:29.263\nYou cannot designate it to be an exact.\n\n112\n00:06:29.263 --> 00:06:32.427\nIt just didn't exist\nwithin the perimeters or\n\n113\n00:06:32.427 --> 00:06:36.411\narguments of the function at\nthe time that it was created.\n\n114\n00:06:36.411 --> 00:06:39.770\nSo, few things to just be aware of.\n\n115\n00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.228\nYeah, cool if we're going\nfrom right to the left.\n\n116\n00:06:42.228 --> 00:06:48.539\nBut even the documentation,\nI'm gonna jump ahead.\n\n117\n00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:52.883\nEven the documentation in\nthe LOOKUP function, it's like,\n\n118\n00:06:52.883 --> 00:06:57.990\nyou really need to use VLOOKUPs,\nwe strongly suggest you use VLOOKUPs.\n\n119\n00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:02.394\nIt's like, it's pushing you\naway from this function, okay?\n\n120\n00:07:02.394 --> 00:07:05.150\nSo that's just letting you know, hey,\n\n121\n00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:10.432\nyou're gonna have a lot more options,\nif you wanna say, for V and H LOOKUPs.\n\n122\n00:07:10.432 --> 00:07:12.830\nOkay, so just throwing that out there.\n\n123\n00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.510\nSo why don't we go ahead and do this?\n\n124\n00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:20.940\nLet's take this example here of I want\nto look up a cat's first name and\n\n125\n00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.900\nreturn the employee ID.\n\n126\n00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.110\nSo let's get into the cell.\n\n127\n00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.675\nLet's open up the dialog box,\nand let's look for,\n\n128\n00:07:28.675 --> 00:07:32.665\nLOOKUP, and we'll go,\nand there's our LOOKUP.\n\n129\n00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:39.330\nNow, right away, you see that\nit actually has two variations.\n\n130\n00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:45.140\nWe have look up,\nlook up value vector, result vector.\n\n131\n00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.620\nWell actually look up value is one,\nsorry, one argument.\n\n132\n00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:53.210\nVectors, this isn't Illustrator,\nare we talking about paths?\n\n133\n00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:59.903\nNo, you really need to think of\nvector in this sense of an array.\n\n134\n00:07:59.903 --> 00:08:02.480\nA group, a range that's all\nyou have to think of it.\n\n135\n00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.909\nMy mind immediately\ngoes to somewhere else.\n\n136\n00:08:04.909 --> 00:08:08.689\nBut you were just talking about this the\nother day, about doing some crazy maths\n\n137\n00:08:08.689 --> 00:08:12.707\nand everything like that, you threw the\nword vector because that's in your world.\n\n138\n00:08:12.707 --> 00:08:16.737\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so there are some of these other\nthings, and I didn't know Excel could\n\n139\n00:08:16.737 --> 00:08:20.350\ndo vector math, and sometimes you'll\nhappen upon what a vector is.\n\n140\n00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:24.620\nSo if we look at row of employee IDs,\nor excuse me,\n\n141\n00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.960\nthe column, then you could think\nof that as a column vector.\n\n142\n00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.780\nSo it's some arbitrary number of elements,\nand\n\n143\n00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:35.510\nthey have an order and\nthey describe something.\n\n144\n00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:40.230\nFor all intents and\npurposes, it's just a range.\n\n145\n00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:43.720\nBut vectors do have specific properties\nthat you're probably not going to have to\n\n146\n00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:48.140\nworry about because they work very\nwell on specific sets of data.\n\n147\n00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it is a mathematical term.\n\n148\n00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:54.790\nSo in my world,\nit's a graphic design term.\n\n149\n00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:59.150\nSo the double meanings, but we have double\nmeanings on all of these things in itself.\n\n150\n00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:02.390\nAnyway, just to let you know that\nthat's what we're going to do first.\n\n151\n00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:06.873\nThis other one is just\nthe look up value in an array.\n\n152\n00:09:06.873 --> 00:09:08.390\nThat kinda sounds like a VLOOKUP.\n\n153\n00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:10.470\nYeah, remember, this one came before.\n\n154\n00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.320\nBut I'll show you both examples.\n\n155\n00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.290\nLet's do the first one.\n\n156\n00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:14.833\nWe click OK.\n\n157\n00:09:14.833 --> 00:09:17.165\nWhat am I looking up?\n\n158\n00:09:17.165 --> 00:09:20.902\nWe're gonna look up the name, we're\ngonna look up what's in this cell, H4.\n\n159\n00:09:20.902 --> 00:09:27.021\nWe're gonna come over to the range\nthat contains the only row or\n\n160\n00:09:27.021 --> 00:09:33.380\ncolumn of our values, so\nwe're going to look up our First Names.\n\n161\n00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:35.460\nClick in the next.\n\n162\n00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:40.370\nNow, this is funny because it says this is\nan optional value, but it's kind of like,\n\n163\n00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:43.580\nhow can it be optional\nif you have to have it?\n\n164\n00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.135\nYou need this, okay?\n\n165\n00:09:45.135 --> 00:09:48.145\nCuz otherwise I'm saying, look up Bishop.\n\n166\n00:09:48.145 --> 00:09:51.940\nOkay, well, that's fine, but\nI wanna return something else.\n\n167\n00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:58.160\nSo it does have its reason, but, again,\nI just think you need a result vector.\n\n168\n00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.940\nSo I'm going to then select these.\n\n169\n00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.400\nAnd then we say, perfect.\n\n170\n00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.084\nSo you can see there is the result,\nit's already showing that it is CC3.\n\n171\n00:10:06.084 --> 00:10:09.282\nThat's exactly what I have,\nlook up Bishop,\n\n172\n00:10:09.282 --> 00:10:12.360\ngo to the left and return the value.\n\n173\n00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.030\nCool, all right, so it's just,\nit's kinda like backwards.\n\n174\n00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:19.470\nDo remember, this is not an exact match.\n\n175\n00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.720\nSo if I type in Alice, that's fine.\n\n176\n00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.570\nNotice that the uppercase\non the L was okay.\n\n177\n00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:32.970\nEven if I did FUEGO in all uppercase,\nit's still going to give me Fuego is 9.\n\n178\n00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:39.217\nBut if I say like Jacks,\nokay, well, Jacks is 11.\n\n179\n00:10:39.217 --> 00:10:46.350\nOkay, so that worked, but that's when\nyou start getting into like, James.\n\n180\n00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:48.318\nOkay, see, there's 11.\n\n181\n00:10:48.318 --> 00:10:55.160\nJack and James are not the same,\nbut it's still giving me 11.\n\n182\n00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.760\nThat where it's not gonna say like,\nnope, it doesn't exist.\n\n183\n00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.183\nIt's just gonna give you something.\n\n184\n00:11:01.183 --> 00:11:07.060\nThat can get a little weird,\nso just be careful of that.\n\n185\n00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:11.400\n&gt;&gt; Now, Vonne, and maybe I missed this\nbecause I got giddy about vectors or\n\n186\n00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:16.250\nsomething, those first names that\nwe're actually searching through,\n\n187\n00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:17.530\nthose are alphabetized.\n\n188\n00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:22.880\nIs that a necessary component, or do we\nget weirdness if they're not alphabetized?\n\n189\n00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:28.070\n&gt;&gt; I am going to ask you to\njust keep that thought because-\n\n190\n00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:28.810\n&gt;&gt; I can do that.\n\n191\n00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:33.180\n&gt;&gt; It will come into play later.\n\n192\n00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:37.700\nNot necessarily because this is like\nthe range, it's not really the range,\n\n193\n00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.100\nit's when we get into the array.\n\n194\n00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.907\nSo do keep that in mind,\nit will come back around.\n\n195\n00:11:42.907 --> 00:11:49.860\nAnd with the approximation,\nthat is where it is in alphabetical order.\n\n196\n00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:55.285\nSo the approximate of where it's finding\nJames, if you see, it's It's after\n\n197\n00:11:55.285 --> 00:11:59.980\nJ-A-C, but it's not all the way to J-A-S.\n\n198\n00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:03.865\nSo it really is in between,\nbut it's going back to Jack.\n\n199\n00:12:03.865 --> 00:12:09.145\nYou can find some patterns when\nthe vector or range is alphabetized,\n\n200\n00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:14.622\nbut if it was not alphabetized,\nthen it'll get a little weird, okay?\n\n201\n00:12:14.622 --> 00:12:19.090\nOkay, so another thing with this, I told\nyou, you have to have the same ranges.\n\n202\n00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:22.554\nAnd the another is if I mismatch these,\nyou're like, okay,\n\n203\n00:12:22.554 --> 00:12:27.240\nwell, let's look at the name cuz we're\ndoing the same, this is the same example.\n\n204\n00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:34.801\nSo if I go with Jack,\nwell, Jack is Jack C11.\n\n205\n00:12:34.801 --> 00:12:35.871\nWhat's going on with that?\n\n206\n00:12:35.871 --> 00:12:38.410\nWell, I purposely messed it up.\n\n207\n00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:41.830\nYou need to make sure because\nit's almost like indexes\n\n208\n00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:44.780\nwhere it's gonna look in the same row.\n\n209\n00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:49.913\nSo when it came over,\nit found Jack but it didn't return 11.\n\n210\n00:12:49.913 --> 00:12:55.167\nIt didn't just go straight over to\nyour table cuz it doesn't see it,\n\n211\n00:12:55.167 --> 00:12:56.900\nit sees it as columns.\n\n212\n00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:01.610\nSo if it's not exact in where one is one,\n\n213\n00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:06.310\ntwo is two, three is three,\nyou're gonna mess it up, okay?\n\n214\n00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:11.090\nSo you gotta be careful about that and\nhow your data is arranged, and\n\n215\n00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:13.790\nthis one has these many,\nthis one has these many.\n\n216\n00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:17.030\nAnd it will be weird.\n\n217\n00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:20.410\nAnd sometimes,\nlike right here, Alice, right?\n\n218\n00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:22.210\nAlice doesn't have anything near it.\n\n219\n00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:24.422\nWait, that's the wrong,\nsorry, that's the wrong cell.\n\n220\n00:13:24.422 --> 00:13:26.200\n[LAUGH] Let's go here.\n\n221\n00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.639\nAlice C4?\n\n222\n00:13:27.639 --> 00:13:29.610\nBut why?\n\n223\n00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:31.433\nCuz that's the first one.\n\n224\n00:13:31.433 --> 00:13:33.600\nYou gotta be careful about your selection.\n\n225\n00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:39.308\nAnd how they match it,\nwhat was that thing in the zip [SOUND]?\n\n226\n00:13:39.308 --> 00:13:41.541\nIt's in the DevPro,\nsorry, I do [CROSSTALK].\n\n227\n00:13:41.541 --> 00:13:46.234\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so actually, it's funny because\nI was just thinking about something\n\n228\n00:13:46.234 --> 00:13:49.950\nthat we did where you search one array,\nlist or vector.\n\n229\n00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:52.840\nYou find its position and\nuse that position\n\n230\n00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.990\nto retrieve a corresponding position\nfrom two corresponding lists.\n\n231\n00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:01.630\nSo essentially you have a vector that I\nneed one-to-one zipped up.matches, right,\n\n232\n00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:05.030\nI need to be able to pair them\nalong both of those columns.\n\n233\n00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:10.522\nAnd if I can't do that then I get\nweirdness cuz you go, wait a minute,\n\n234\n00:14:10.522 --> 00:14:16.046\nI actually need position 3, but\nposition 3 over here it's [SOUND].\n\n235\n00:14:16.046 --> 00:14:18.576\nHave you ever tried to zip your coat or\nsomething like that, and\n\n236\n00:14:18.576 --> 00:14:20.360\nyour zipper gets all jacked up?\n\n237\n00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.010\nThen that's kinda how things are.\n\n238\n00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:25.862\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, and we just did enumeration\nand helpers yesterday in DevProTV and\n\n239\n00:14:25.862 --> 00:14:26.846\nI remembered that.\n\n240\n00:14:26.846 --> 00:14:28.850\nAnd I was like, that's really cool.\n\n241\n00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:29.982\nSo it just reminds me, hm.\n\n242\n00:14:29.982 --> 00:14:35.452\nIt's like these things all have this\nkinda base language that they talk in,\n\n243\n00:14:35.452 --> 00:14:36.400\nhow is that?\n\n244\n00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.915\nI don't know.\nYeah, exactly.\n\n245\n00:14:37.915 --> 00:14:40.890\n[LAUGH] Okay, so\nnow let's go with this one.\n\n246\n00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:42.245\nThis one's kind of weird.\n\n247\n00:14:42.245 --> 00:14:47.960\nWeird in the sense like, how many times is\nyour data going to be organized this way?\n\n248\n00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:53.612\nBut it's kinda neat, like right here,\nBishop, it's returning C3.\n\n249\n00:14:53.612 --> 00:14:56.620\nWell, there is nothing in these employees.\n\n250\n00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:03.830\nInteresting thing about the LOOKUP\nfunction is that you can\n\n251\n00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:06.820\nhave it in two different orientations.\n\n252\n00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:15.250\nSo I have, it's still that whole, 1, 2, 3,\n4, how am I zipping up if it's doing that?\n\n253\n00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:20.178\nSo Alice is with CC1,\nBell is with CC2, Bishop CC3.\n\n254\n00:15:20.178 --> 00:15:25.040\nBecause they're the same length or\nsame size.\n\n255\n00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:30.410\nEven though the first thing is going\nvertically, and the employee ID is going\n\n256\n00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:34.390\nhorizontally, they'll still match up,\nokay?\n\n257\n00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:36.210\nHow many times your data\ngonna be arranged this way?\n\n258\n00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:37.414\nI'm not sure, but\n\n259\n00:15:37.414 --> 00:15:42.380\nit's just kind of a neat little nuance\nof this particular function is that they\n\n260\n00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:47.214\ndon't have to have the same orientation\nof how the information is aligned.\n\n261\n00:15:47.214 --> 00:15:51.492\nBut index position matters, so\nthat's the whole matching up.\n\n262\n00:15:51.492 --> 00:15:55.166\nIf it doesn't match up\nthe way you want it to,\n\n263\n00:15:55.166 --> 00:15:58.667\nthen that's where It gets a little wonky.\n\n264\n00:15:58.667 --> 00:16:02.470\nAnd so, you can have it in\ntwo different directions.\n\n265\n00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:05.660\nAnd again, you can see it's\njust looking up this value,\n\n266\n00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:10.290\nwhat's is my first vector arrange,\nwhat's my second vector arrange.\n\n267\n00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:12.500\nAnd then it goes ahead and does it.\n\n268\n00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:17.140\nI've also seen this particular function\n\n269\n00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:22.170\nwritten to where well I'm not sure\nif it's gonna be the same size.\n\n270\n00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:24.610\nMaybe there's like some different data.\n\n271\n00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:30.800\nWhat you could do is you can,\nlet's go with just typing it all out.\n\n272\n00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:37.240\nYou can look up and then use your\nvector or range as the whole column.\n\n273\n00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:40.130\nJust say,\njust look up everything in column C and\n\n274\n00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:45.280\nthen everything in column A and\nthen there you go.\n\n275\n00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:50.750\nGreat, and it will, well,\nJacka doesn't exist but Jack does.\n\n276\n00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:55.300\nAnd let's go back to Bishop okay, so we'll\ngo with Bishop and now you can see it.\n\n277\n00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:58.610\nThen you got a little be careful though,\nis what if you get duplicates?\n\n278\n00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:02.420\nWhat if your employee IDs.\n\n279\n00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:05.190\nAll of this will get,\neven what's regular lookups, so\n\n280\n00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:09.090\nthis is not just reserved for\nlookups by themself.\n\n281\n00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:13.410\nI said regular as in vertical lookups,\nsorry, I kinda flipped those around.\n\n282\n00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:14.590\nDuplicate values and\n\n283\n00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:17.400\nif your not doing it, it's just\ngoing to give you like the first.\n\n284\n00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:21.462\nSo you do have to be careful of that ane\npeople are like, well what if it does?\n\n285\n00:17:21.462 --> 00:17:23.606\nI'm like, you go nest and you go ahead and\n\n286\n00:17:23.606 --> 00:17:27.971\nstart writing other functions inside of it\nto go ahead and tell you all these things.\n\n287\n00:17:27.971 --> 00:17:34.780\nBut just be aware that duplicates\nwill throw off your results.\n\n288\n00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.497\nOkay but anyways it does say,\n\n289\n00:17:36.497 --> 00:17:41.180\nhey, everything in column C, lookup and\nover to column A and give me back.\n\n290\n00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:45.101\nGreat when you have like\nspecific items in there.\n\n291\n00:17:45.101 --> 00:17:50.740\nSo we've got the column referenced,\njust another way to write it.\n\n292\n00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:57.460\nNow the array this is where, okay this\nkinda looks like a vertical lookup, right?\n\n293\n00:17:58.760 --> 00:17:59.870\nBecause it is.\n\n294\n00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:05.070\nWe're saying with an array, let's go into\nthe dialogue box so we can see right here.\n\n295\n00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:10.850\ni'm gonna choose that second one right\nthere of the lookup and the array.\n\n296\n00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:11.430\nClick OK.\n\n297\n00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:13.200\nSo what's the lookup value?\n\n298\n00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:13.770\nI'm looking up.\n\n299\n00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:17.180\nSo right now what we're doing is\nwe want to populate team colors.\n\n300\n00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:20.660\nSo the team color is based on\nwhat department you are in.\n\n301\n00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:28.160\nSo to find what team color I have,\nI have to look to this particular cell.\n\n302\n00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.074\nTell me what's in the cell in B2.\n\n303\n00:18:31.074 --> 00:18:32.840\nCome over to the array.\n\n304\n00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:34.310\nNotice that there's\nthe only other argument.\n\n305\n00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:36.620\nIt says, tell me what the table array is.\n\n306\n00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:37.210\nIt's right here.\n\n307\n00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:40.210\nNow, I know that I'm going\nto copy this down, so\n\n308\n00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:44.080\nI'm gonna go ahead and F4 and\nabsolute reference this.\n\n309\n00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:49.020\nSo look at B2,\nfind the array here, click OK.\n\n310\n00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:53.350\nAnd Justin, just to ask you,\nis Human Resources blue?\n\n311\n00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:54.160\n&gt;&gt; It is blue.\n\n312\n00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.040\n&gt;&gt; Okay, cool.\n\n313\n00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.120\nI'm going to check you on that.\n\n314\n00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:01.060\nSo now, I'm gonna take in here.\n\n315\n00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:03.780\nSo, Advertising is red, yes.\n\n316\n00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.430\nPurple, Marketing, okay.\n\n317\n00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:10.616\nGoing on down, do you see any\nof them that's a little weird?\n\n318\n00:19:10.616 --> 00:19:14.665\n&gt;&gt; Purple's in there a bunch of times.\n\n319\n00:19:14.665 --> 00:19:16.184\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n320\n00:19:16.184 --> 00:19:21.055\n&gt;&gt; Why is purple for Sales,\ncuz Sales is actually a valid lookup?\n\n321\n00:19:21.055 --> 00:19:23.614\nMm-hm and Sales is yellow.\n\n322\n00:19:23.614 --> 00:19:27.972\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, right?\n\n323\n00:19:27.972 --> 00:19:31.650\n[LAUGH] I know you're sitting there going,\nI don't understand.\n\n324\n00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:32.570\nAnd it's not spelled wrong.\n\n325\n00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:35.470\n&gt;&gt; But if you go down to\nAdvertising that works again.\n\n326\n00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:36.560\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Wait a minute,\n\n327\n00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:37.788\nthere's hidden spaces, isn't there?\n\n328\n00:19:37.788 --> 00:19:38.408\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n329\n00:19:38.408 --> 00:19:45.394\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Remember that thing I told you\nI'm gonna have you hold that until later?\n\n330\n00:19:45.394 --> 00:19:46.604\n&gt;&gt; No, I totally forgot.\n\n331\n00:19:46.604 --> 00:19:50.710\n[LAUGH] They're not alphabetized.\n\n332\n00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:52.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but what is not alphabetized?\n\n333\n00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:56.070\n&gt;&gt; The respective look up table.\n\n334\n00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:59.789\n&gt;&gt; Yes that makes a difference.\n\n335\n00:19:59.789 --> 00:20:01.750\n&gt;&gt; That's unfortunate.\n\n336\n00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:06.480\n&gt;&gt; This is where it should\ndemonstrate if you had a vlookup.\n\n337\n00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:10.320\nAnd you had an exact match and everything,\neverything would be fine, right?\n\n338\n00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.300\nIt wouldn't matter what\norder your table is in,\n\n339\n00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:15.610\nyou could have any department you want.\n\n340\n00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:17.220\nIt didn't have to be alphabetized.\n\n341\n00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:21.880\nThat's again where they kinda\njust improved the lookup.\n\n342\n00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:22.770\nBut, watch this.\n\n343\n00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:27.970\nIf I take here, and watch for the sales,\nif I take this Oops, that's the wrong one.\n\n344\n00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:34.117\nAnd then we sort ascending then it works.\n\n345\n00:20:34.117 --> 00:20:37.335\nYeah, your array,\nif you're gonna use the array,\n\n346\n00:20:37.335 --> 00:20:39.977\nyou're gonna need it to be alphabetized.\n\n347\n00:20:39.977 --> 00:20:42.510\nAnd you gotta be careful about that, and\n\n348\n00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:47.290\nin the documentation it does talk about,\nyou need to have these ascending.\n\n349\n00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:49.810\nYou need to have them sorted.\n\n350\n00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:53.410\nOkay, so right there,\nthe values in a lookup vector\n\n351\n00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:57.800\nmust be placed in ascending orders\notherwise, okay, uppercase.\n\n352\n00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.829\nAll right.\nSo we need to have the same size,\n\n353\n00:20:59.829 --> 00:21:03.287\nyou have to have it sorted,\nokay this is even in the vector part.\n\n354\n00:21:03.287 --> 00:21:06.541\nOkay, so we have to have it sorted,\nhave to have the same range.\n\n355\n00:21:06.541 --> 00:21:10.361\nWe can go to the left which is pretty\ncool and we can have an array, but\n\n356\n00:21:10.361 --> 00:21:11.986\nif we don't have the match.\n\n357\n00:21:11.986 --> 00:21:15.947\nOkay, it does have some limitations\nthat's just the nature of\n\n358\n00:21:15.947 --> 00:21:20.744\nthis particular function, but in certain\nsituations it can be kinda cool.\n\n359\n00:21:20.744 --> 00:21:26.210\nAnd it can give you what you need\nif this is exactly what you need.\n\n360\n00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:30.060\nBut that's the array\ndoes have to be sorted.\n\n361\n00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:35.330\n&gt;&gt; FYI Yvonne, typically when you're\nsearching through a vector or\n\n362\n00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:39.240\nan array or, like you have a list of\nthings and you're searching through them,\n\n363\n00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:43.800\nif they're in some kind of sorted order\nThat's always going to make things easier\n\n364\n00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:47.450\nbecause you can make certain\nassumptions if there sorted.\n\n365\n00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:51.670\nAnd do things like, let me go to the\nmiddle, is what I'm looking for less or\n\n366\n00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:52.490\ngreater than that?\n\n367\n00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:54.605\nAnd then you can, kind of, bounce around.\n\n368\n00:21:54.605 --> 00:21:56.245\nNumber one, it's performance thing.\n\n369\n00:21:56.245 --> 00:22:00.245\nBut number two, you can kind of short\ncircuit because you can go, I found it.\n\n370\n00:22:00.245 --> 00:22:02.595\nAnd then stop,\nyou don't have to continue searching.\n\n371\n00:22:02.595 --> 00:22:03.785\n&gt;&gt; I remember you're talking about this.\n\n372\n00:22:03.785 --> 00:22:08.525\nThis comes from that math background\nI was, what a vector does and\n\n373\n00:22:08.525 --> 00:22:10.975\nhow you do vector math.\n\n374\n00:22:10.975 --> 00:22:16.085\nSo, it all actually it means something\n[LAUGH] in the grand scheme of things.\n\n375\n00:22:16.085 --> 00:22:17.600\nThat's pretty cool.\n\n376\n00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.894\nOne last thing I wanna talk about\njust to kind of throw this is with\n\n377\n00:22:20.894 --> 00:22:22.000\nthe sorting, okay?\n\n378\n00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.460\nLet's jump back down in the computer so\nJustin, I'm gonna put you on alert again,\n\n379\n00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:31.370\nout of column A and column B,\nwhich one is sorted properly?\n\n380\n00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:34.080\nCan you see that?\n\n381\n00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:38.110\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna say column\nA is sorted appropriately.\n\n382\n00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:39.875\n&gt;&gt; The way that we would normally do it,\nright?\n\n383\n00:22:39.875 --> 00:22:41.120\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n384\n00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.913\n&gt;&gt; But with text,\nthat's not how it's, yeah, so\n\n385\n00:22:43.913 --> 00:22:49.585\nwhen you name files on your computer,\nif you have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.\n\n386\n00:22:49.585 --> 00:22:52.985\nSo yeah, it does weirdness,\nit don't like it.\n\n387\n00:22:52.985 --> 00:22:53.820\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, I know it.\n\n388\n00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:55.720\nI actually got you on something.\n\n389\n00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:58.288\nI'm so excited where you're\nI didn't even see that.\n\n390\n00:22:58.288 --> 00:23:04.917\nYeah, this is actually sorted correctly\naccording to the computer because yeah,\n\n391\n00:23:04.917 --> 00:23:10.510\nit's going, with text it's 1111, 2, 3.\n\n392\n00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:16.700\nIn our brains this is how it still works,\nthat's the correct sorting\n\n393\n00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:21.930\nbut if I took this and then sorted this\nascending, that's how it will sort.\n\n394\n00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:24.470\nBecause it's with text.\n\n395\n00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:29.280\nIf you have number, say this is like\nthe way it's like the computer source but\n\n396\n00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:32.150\nthere's nothing else in the cell,\njust numbers.\n\n397\n00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:36.900\nIf I took this and sorted this ascending,\nit's gonna sort the way the numbers work.\n\n398\n00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:38.870\nIt's only when it is associated with text.\n\n399\n00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:43.340\nSo if you have something with text and\nnumbers and\n\n400\n00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:47.780\nyou wanna use a lookup function and\nyou want to have it sorted ascending,\n\n401\n00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:50.950\nit will sort like this,\nit won't sort like that.\n\n402\n00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:56.010\nSo just be careful of that if any\ntime that your data has numbers and\n\n403\n00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:58.410\nyou have to sort it,\nit will throw this off.\n\n404\n00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:00.900\nWhich might throw you off and\n\n405\n00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:05.550\nthrow off how you want your\ndata to be actually organized.\n\n406\n00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:07.590\nSo just wanted to kinda\ngo back into there.\n\n407\n00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:12.030\nSo LOOKUP's, it's got some cool\nfunctionality, if that's what you need.\n\n408\n00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:17.970\nBut the power from the v and h lookups,\nthat might be where you go but\n\n409\n00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:22.810\nif you do need to go the other direction,\ndon't start the left most and go right.\n\n410\n00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:27.118\nYou need to find the right then go to\nthe left, you might need to go ahead and\n\n411\n00:24:27.118 --> 00:24:29.428\nlook at the lookup function, for you.\n\n412\n00:24:29.428 --> 00:24:31.810\n&gt;&gt; All right, Vonne,\nI do have a quick question for you.\n\n413\n00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:33.346\nThat whole sorting thing,\n\n414\n00:24:33.346 --> 00:24:37.163\nthat is a tricky one cuz that actually\nagitates me on my file system.\n\n415\n00:24:37.163 --> 00:24:40.349\nI'm like, no, I named that one number\nten cuz it's supposed to come after\n\n416\n00:24:40.349 --> 00:24:42.340\nnumber nine, not after number one.\n\n417\n00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:48.550\nHowever, inside of that Excel sheet, could\n\n418\n00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:54.210\nwe use other functions that are in\nthe series to grab just the numeric part,\n\n419\n00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:59.080\ncreate another column that is numeric and\nthen sort on that?\n\n420\n00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:02.470\nSo I get the corresponding correct\nsort for the file names so\n\n421\n00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:03.955\nthat my lookup would work correctly.\n\n422\n00:25:03.955 --> 00:25:05.007\n&gt;&gt; Why yes you can.\n\n423\n00:25:05.007 --> 00:25:06.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; For\n\n424\n00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:10.600\nthat particular example\nthe numbers are on the right.\n\n425\n00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:15.680\nSo you can use the right function but\nthen they're varying, right?\n\n426\n00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:20.000\nSo then, you would need to combine\nthat with the len function.\n\n427\n00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.950\nSo look at the length of this string or\n\n428\n00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:27.910\ntext and\nreturn this much after the first face.\n\n429\n00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:29.080\nThat's what you can do.\n\n430\n00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:35.080\nI think that we actually do\nthat exact example In the find\n\n431\n00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:38.180\nright I think it's fine because you\nhave to find the first space and\n\n432\n00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:39.750\nthen take all the text to the right.\n\n433\n00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:41.270\nSo I'm pretty sure it's in that episode.\n\n434\n00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:43.410\nBut you know what?\n\n435\n00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:46.330\nWatch them all because the left\nthe right the mid the len\n\n436\n00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:47.914\nthe find the search the replace.\n\n437\n00:25:47.914 --> 00:25:52.120\nThey all have its purpose and\nwhere you would go satart do like,\n\n438\n00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:55.365\nwe now wanna do this, I wanna do that,\nhow do I put them all together.\n\n439\n00:25:55.365 --> 00:25:57.290\nSo, definitely check those episodes out.\n\n440\n00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:01.199\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I always like to challenge myself\nto see, hey, can I take this function and\n\n441\n00:26:01.199 --> 00:26:03.806\nthis function, add a little salt and\npepper and boom,\n\n442\n00:26:03.806 --> 00:26:07.680\nhave something that actually works for\nme, and, doesn't make me frustrated.\n\n443\n00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:11.437\nSo, if you've been watching this series\nthere's a lot of tools in your tool belt\n\n444\n00:26:11.437 --> 00:26:14.160\nand well we're not done yet,\nso definitely come on back.\n\n445\n00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.920\nBut for now we're gonna go ahead and\nget out of here.\n\n446\n00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:18.690\nSo signing off for Office Pro TV,\nI'm your host Justin Dennison.\n\n447\n00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:19.440\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n448\n00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.992\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n449\n00:26:20.992 -->

I like what you did there.\n\n9\n00:00:30.185 --> 00:00:30.685\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n10\n00:00:30.685 --> 00:00:32.129\n&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm doing great, how are you?\n\n11\n00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:34.200\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic.\n\n12\n00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.130\nCHOOSE,\n\n13\n00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.800\nwe've kinda been on this run lately,\nBLOOKUP, HLOOKUP.\n\n14\n00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.470\nLOOKUP, is CHOOSE in the same family, or\n\n15\n00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.581\nam I totally off base here?\n&gt;&gt; No, it is.\n\n16\n00:00:44.581 --> 00:00:51.660\nIt is definitely in that look up and\nreference categories of functions.\n\n17\n00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.480\nAnd it's like, hm, all right, well CHOOSE.\n\n18\n00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.560\nDoes that mean I'm gonna just\nrandomly choose something?\n\n19\n00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.360\nNo, not really [LAUGH].\n\n20\n00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:05.600\nWhat it's gonna do, is it's going to\nchoose from a list that you provide.\n\n21\n00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.896\nIt's like?\n\n22\n00:01:06.896 --> 00:01:10.560\nThat sounds like a lot of\nthe things we've been doing.\n\n23\n00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.170\nSo, how does this work?\n\n24\n00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.300\nOkay, let's go right to the documentation\nand do some examples and\n\n25\n00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:22.820\nthen see what it does because I don't\nwanna say there's not much to it.\n\n26\n00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:30.130\nIt's just pretty straight forward and it\ndoes have specific use case scenarios for\n\n27\n00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.160\nwhen you would want to choose\nthe choose function over,\n\n28\n00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.940\nmaybe, a VLOOKUP or\na MATCH INDEX and some other types.\n\n29\n00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.840\nSo let's get started.\n\n30\n00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.790\nI've brought up the documentation,\nwell that's the file we're gonna use.\n\n31\n00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.157\nBut the documentation\nuse index_num to return\n\n32\n00:01:50.157 --> 00:01:55.400\na value from a list of value arguments,\nokay.\n\n33\n00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.970\nSo then let's keep going.\n\n34\n00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.430\nUse CHOOSE to select one of up to 254\nvalues based on the index number.\n\n35\n00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.702\nOkay, if you don't understand what\nan index number is, that's gonna be kind\n\n36\n00:02:06.702 --> 00:02:10.730\nof like, I'm reading this and\nI have no idea what you're talking about.\n\n37\n00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:15.850\nSo that's just something that we\nhave talked in other episodes,\n\n38\n00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.760\nso just a quick one.\n\n39\n00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.060\nIf I said dog, cat and bird, right?\n\n40\n00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.680\nWhat index number is cat?\n&gt;&gt; You said dog,\n\n41\n00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.570\ncat, index two.\n&gt;&gt; Index two, correct, yeah.\n\n42\n00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.500\nSo it's when we write a list of something,\nand\n\n43\n00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.120\nI had to remind myself dog, cat,\nbird, we said, one, two, three.\n\n44\n00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.279\nSo if I said, well,\nwhat is index position one?\n\n45\n00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:43.540\nYou would say, dog.\n\n46\n00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.346\nIf I say, what is index position three?\n\n47\n00:02:45.346 --> 00:02:46.435\nYou would say, bird.\n\n48\n00:02:46.435 --> 00:02:48.160\nAnd I said cat is two.\n\n49\n00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.700\nSo just like the episode with the LOOKUP,\nthey match, okay?\n\n50\n00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.590\nSo that's what we have\nwith an index number.\n\n51\n00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.670\nAnd what it's going to do is you're going\nto give it the index number, and then\n\n52\n00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:08.834\nwith whatever list that you put directly\ninto the function, it's gonna choose that.\n\n53\n00:03:08.834 --> 00:03:09.699\nOkay.\n\n54\n00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:11.804\nLet's see some examples and\n\n55\n00:03:11.804 --> 00:03:17.390\nsee if this kind of comes back around\ninto our brains and makes sense.\n\n56\n00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.800\nSo if I said this is gonna\nseem just like a LOOKUP, okay?\n\n57\n00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.140\nBecause, it is.\n\n58\n00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.933\nIf I said, Justin,\n\n59\n00:03:25.933 --> 00:03:30.135\nwhat team color is Alice Wonderpaws?\n&gt;&gt; Red.\n\n60\n00:03:30.135 --> 00:03:31.059\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, and\n\n61\n00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:33.810\nBishop Timothy would be?\n&gt;&gt; Blue.\n\n62\n00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.800\n&gt;&gt; Okay, because it's based on\n\n63\n00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.910\nthe number, right?\n\n64\n00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.010\nSo, I could totally do a VLOOKUP and\nsay, hey, look this up, totally fine.\n\n65\n00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.332\nSame thing with this, same idea, okay?\n\n66\n00:03:43.332 --> 00:03:46.290\nBut the lookup value is a number, correct?\n\n67\n00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.920\nIt is a position, it is saying it's\na whole number, one through whatever.\n\n68\n00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.880\nSo what the CHOOSE can do, now notice,\nthis is where I have an actual table.\n\n69\n00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.008\nWell what if you don't really wanna\nput the whole table off to the side or\n\n70\n00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:03.900\nanother worksheet or anything like that?\n\n71\n00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.380\nYou just wanna put it right in there,\nokay?\n\n72\n00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.410\nSo I could do, all right, let's =choose.\n\n73\n00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:11.680\nI'm gonna type this one out.\n\n74\n00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.110\nYou know what?\n\n75\n00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.740\nI just realized I'm not gonna type this\none out, because this is one that it\n\n76\n00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.360\nactually does lend itself to use\nthe dialogue box pretty well.\n\n77\n00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:26.630\nSo I wanna put in my values\ndirectly into the function.\n\n78\n00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.840\nSo I'm gonna find the CHOOSE and\nI'm gonna click OK.\n\n79\n00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.560\nWhat I'm I looking up?\n\n80\n00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.630\nIn this case I'm going with here.\n\n81\n00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.580\nWhatever is in cell two is\ngoing to create a number,\n\n82\n00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.380\nfrom 1 through,\nit looks like 4, with this one.\n\n83\n00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.309\nWhat's my value 1?\nWell, this is where you determine,\n\n84\n00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:50.870\nI want this to be red.\n\n85\n00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.010\nAnd notice we're using the dialogue box\nbecause you wanted to put the syntax into\n\n86\n00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.330\nwhere it puts the comma and\nthen the quotes around your string,\n\n87\n00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.680\ncuz that makes it a little easier.\n\n88\n00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:06.470\nSo red, yellow, tab, green and blue, okay.\n\n89\n00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.930\nSo what that means is one is red, two is\nyellow, three is green, four is blue.\n\n90\n00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.050\nClick OK, that's exactly what it does.\n\n91\n00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.364\nSo you see how with this, and I don't\nneed to do an absolute reference or\n\n92\n00:05:19.364 --> 00:05:20.367\nanything like that.\n\n93\n00:05:20.367 --> 00:05:24.389\nIt's just, hey, whatever number this is\n\n94\n00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:29.100\nyou are going to then choose\nfrom this index list.\n\n95\n00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:34.210\nThis is one, this is two, this is three,\nthis is four, and there you go.\n\n96\n00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.295\nThat is what the choose function does,\nokay?\n\n97\n00:05:38.295 --> 00:05:41.980\nSo, you'd create it right within itself.\n\n98\n00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.350\nThat's it, really [LAUGH].\n\n99\n00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:50.290\nI have a couple more examples\nbecause you're like, okay.\n\n100\n00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:55.090\nWell, all right, the positioning of\nyour list does make a difference.\n\n101\n00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.300\nSo let's do it one more time on this one,\njust for fun.\n\n102\n00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.750\nSo we will click CHOOSE and\nthis is what we're looking at.\n\n103\n00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.870\nOkay, so let's go with these are scores.\n\n104\n00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.691\nSo one would be poor, all right,\n\n105\n00:06:09.691 --> 00:06:14.523\nand then two would be okay [LAUGH].\n\n106\n00:06:14.523 --> 00:06:18.430\nAnd then this would be good.\n\n107\n00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:24.610\nAnd maybe we'll go with a very good and\na excellent, all right?\n\n108\n00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:29.050\nSo that's our value system\nfrom 1 through 5, perfect.\n\n109\n00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.974\nSo if somebody rates it a 4 there,\nit's very good.\n\n110\n00:06:30.974 --> 00:06:36.030\nAnd it is directly into the function.\n\n111\n00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.160\nYou have a puzzling look over there,\nJustin.\n\n112\n00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.810\nCan I ask,\nwhat's going on in that noggin of yours?\n\n113\n00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.738\n&gt;&gt; So in here, is it,\n\n114\n00:06:43.738 --> 00:06:49.245\nI'm trying to think of, so, What happens\n\n115\n00:06:49.245 --> 00:06:54.163\nif we now give it a number that's outside\n\n116\n00:06:54.163 --> 00:06:59.194\nof how many arguments we have?\n&gt;&gt; That's a good one,\n\n117\n00:06:59.194 --> 00:07:00.490\nso what about six?\n\n118\n00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:01.688\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n119\n00:07:01.688 --> 00:07:02.890\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n120\n00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:03.790\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't understand.\n\n121\n00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.780\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right, so that's broke.\n\n122\n00:07:09.443 --> 00:07:13.540\nIs this something that you would\nbe concerned with maintainability?\n\n123\n00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.588\nLike if I have to go back and\nchange these?\n\n124\n00:07:16.588 --> 00:07:20.983\nIt seems like this function would be an\nissue as far as all these things internal\n\n125\n00:07:20.983 --> 00:07:24.130\nto the function.\n&gt;&gt; I think I know where you're going.\n\n126\n00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.905\nSo in a sense of poor, okay, good.\n\n127\n00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:30.351\nWell now, what if it's excellence,\nlike super good?\n\n128\n00:07:30.351 --> 00:07:31.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n129\n00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.050\n&gt;&gt; That could be solved with one\n\n130\n00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:36.510\nother variation, let me show you.\n\n131\n00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:38.510\nAnd this is where you might start going,\nbut that's,\n\n132\n00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:40.010\nwhy don't you just use a LOOKUP?\n\n133\n00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.530\nI know, I know,\nthis is an alternative, okay?\n\n134\n00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:47.975\nSo this is just another way of doing\na lookup because you are saying\n\n135\n00:07:47.975 --> 00:07:54.029\nhere is the number, look up the index\nof that list and return that value.\n\n136\n00:07:54.029 --> 00:07:55.740\nSo it is in the family.\n\n137\n00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:00.490\nSo if your brain's like, why would I, I\nthink I still use the LOOKUP, that's fine.\n\n138\n00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:03.957\nWell okay, okay,\njust explaining what CHOOSE does.\n\n139\n00:08:03.957 --> 00:08:07.070\nYou could use cell references.\n\n140\n00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:13.803\nAnd so I could say I would like\nyou to look at this number,\n\n141\n00:08:13.803 --> 00:08:18.834\nand then I'd like this to be 1, 2, 3.\n\n142\n00:08:18.834 --> 00:08:21.276\nSo, you see,\nI'm using the cell reference that, whoops.\n\n143\n00:08:21.276 --> 00:08:24.960\nThat's, hey.\n&gt;&gt; You missed [INAUDIBLE].\n\n144\n00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.204\n&gt;&gt; I did, didn't I?\n\n145\n00:08:26.204 --> 00:08:26.836\nYou know what I did?\n\n146\n00:08:26.836 --> 00:08:29.186\nI think, no, that's Super Bad.\n&gt;&gt; No, you were Pretty Good.\n\n147\n00:08:29.186 --> 00:08:32.154\nYou missed G5.\n\n148\n00:08:32.154 --> 00:08:33.802\nThere you go.\n&gt;&gt; There, thank you, okay.\n\n149\n00:08:33.802 --> 00:08:36.068\n[LAUGH] Without the words.\n\n150\n00:08:36.068 --> 00:08:37.546\nWell, let me write off to the side.\n\n151\n00:08:37.546 --> 00:08:39.618\n[SOUND] Okay, so\nI should've just saw those.\n\n152\n00:08:39.618 --> 00:08:42.643\nOkay, that's where I could\nuse the cell reference.\n\n153\n00:08:42.643 --> 00:08:47.358\nSo instead of strings of text in\neach argument, I could say, yeah,\n\n154\n00:08:47.358 --> 00:08:48.530\npull all these.\n\n155\n00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:52.687\nAnd then, oops, I have to absolute\nreference every single one of these,\n\n156\n00:08:52.687 --> 00:08:53.702\nI just realized.\n\n157\n00:08:53.702 --> 00:08:54.984\nSo okay, so why?\n\n158\n00:08:54.984 --> 00:08:59.880\nCuz we're gonna copy down, so keep going.\n\n159\n00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.964\nOne more, F4, Copy.\n\n160\n00:09:02.964 --> 00:09:04.037\nIt seems like a lot of work.\n\n161\n00:09:04.037 --> 00:09:06.793\nAnd then we pull this down, and there.\n\n162\n00:09:06.793 --> 00:09:07.703\nI messed that up.\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n163\n00:09:07.703 --> 00:09:11.878\naccidentally it absolute\nreferenced the value lookup.\n\n164\n00:09:11.878 --> 00:09:13.795\n&gt;&gt; Wrong one, okay.\n\n165\n00:09:13.795 --> 00:09:17.113\nI was seeing if y'all\nwere gonna catch that.\n\n166\n00:09:17.113 --> 00:09:18.284\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n167\n00:09:18.284 --> 00:09:19.948\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n168\n00:09:19.948 --> 00:09:20.765\n&gt;&gt; Well luckily I was\n\n169\n00:09:20.765 --> 00:09:21.968\ntrying to pay attention.\n\n170\n00:09:21.968 --> 00:09:23.360\nAnd did I do good?\n\n171\n00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.754\nWhat was my rating?\n\n172\n00:09:24.754 --> 00:09:28.140\nDid I get a five?\n&gt;&gt; I would say you got a five, for sure.\n\n173\n00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.870\nSo yes, and this is where,\njust to kind of complete that thought,\n\n174\n00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.910\ncuz I know you're going\nsomewhere else now.\n\n175\n00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:40.229\nSo if you wanted like,\nit's not Super Bad, it's Very Not Good.\n\n176\n00:09:40.229 --> 00:09:43.865\n[LAUGH] I know,\nthat's not something you would change.\n\n177\n00:09:43.865 --> 00:09:46.258\nBut you could go ahead and change it.\n\n178\n00:09:46.258 --> 00:09:49.270\nSuper Good, yay.\n\n179\n00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:56.598\nSo you could change it that way of you're\nusing the references to pull this out.\n\n180\n00:09:56.598 --> 00:10:01.376\nAll right, so\nI'm going to cover two things\n\n181\n00:10:01.376 --> 00:10:05.389\nthat maybe all y'all are thinking.\n\n182\n00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:06.446\nOkay, well that's great.\n\n183\n00:10:06.446 --> 00:10:10.850\nBut what if I have decimal?\n\n184\n00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:16.370\nWhat if we're gathering this up and\nI need to evaluate what is 4.2?\n\n185\n00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.631\nWhat is 4.5?\n\n186\n00:10:18.631 --> 00:10:24.988\nWell normally, in regular rounding world,\nthe rule is 5 and above, right?\n\n187\n00:10:24.988 --> 00:10:30.088\nSo if I said 4.2, it's still Good.\n\n188\n00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:33.823\n1.4, still Very Not Good.\n\n189\n00:10:33.823 --> 00:10:38.400\n[LAUGH] If I did 1.9, what would you think\n\n190\n00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:43.367\nwould happen, Justin, normally?\n&gt;&gt; I would say,\n\n191\n00:10:43.367 --> 00:10:46.780\nbased on rounding rules, it would go to 2.\n\n192\n00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.505\nBut I don't know about this.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n193\n00:10:49.505 --> 00:10:52.127\n&gt;&gt; It didn't, so is it truncating?\n\n194\n00:10:52.127 --> 00:10:55.050\n&gt;&gt; It totally is truncating!\n\n195\n00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:57.710\nWould you like to explain\nwhat truncate means?\n\n196\n00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:58.586\n&gt;&gt; So truncate says,\n\n197\n00:10:58.586 --> 00:11:00.568\nall right there's a decimal point there.\n\n198\n00:11:00.568 --> 00:11:02.448\nWe're gonna slice and\nI don't care about that.\n\n199\n00:11:02.448 --> 00:11:04.605\nEssentially, that's how it's truncated.\n\n200\n00:11:04.605 --> 00:11:11.510\nJust give me the whole number, regardless\nof whether it's 0.9, 0.1, 0.999999999.\n\n201\n00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:13.000\n[SOUND] Just cut that off and\n\n202\n00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.466\nforget about it.\n&gt;&gt; Do not\n\n203\n00:11:14.466 --> 00:11:15.500\nround.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n204\n00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.007\n&gt;&gt; That is the whole idea of truncate.\n\n205\n00:11:17.007 --> 00:11:22.264\nAnd that is what it does and\nwhat it treats it\n\n206\n00:11:22.264 --> 00:11:28.266\nas when you have decimals for\nyour index number.\n\n207\n00:11:28.266 --> 00:11:29.420\nNumber.\n\n208\n00:11:32.288 --> 00:11:36.325\nI'm skipping my worksheets,\n\n209\n00:11:36.325 --> 00:11:41.301\nbut what if this was yes or something?\n\n210\n00:11:41.301 --> 00:11:44.780\nThe whole idea of the CHOOSE,\nit has to be a number.\n\n211\n00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:49.500\nThe thing that you're looking\nup must be a numerical value.\n\n212\n00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:56.590\nAnd the numerical value has a place,\nin the sense of\n\n213\n00:11:56.590 --> 00:12:01.471\nwhat you are putting as your values,\nthey need to be in an order.\n\n214\n00:12:01.471 --> 00:12:04.700\nWell, what if I'm doing this?\n\n215\n00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:08.670\nWhat if I wanna look up,\nokay, give me the team color?\n\n216\n00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:10.960\nLook up Human Resources and give me Blue.\n\n217\n00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.400\nHuman Resources is not a number is it?\n\n218\n00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.224\nNo, so it's text.\n\n219\n00:12:16.224 --> 00:12:21.870\nYou can't use a DHOOSE function\nwith something like this.\n\n220\n00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:25.562\nYeah, you could go ahead and\ndo this, you can get around it.\n\n221\n00:12:25.562 --> 00:12:31.950\nBut it has to have a numerical\nvalue in the LOOKUP value.\n\n222\n00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:35.610\nCuz that returns the INDEX number and\nthen it goes like this.\n\n223\n00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:39.466\nSo straight text like look\nup Human Resources and\n\n224\n00:12:39.466 --> 00:12:42.956\ngive me team Blue,\nyou would use a VLOOKUP.\n\n225\n00:12:42.956 --> 00:12:48.030\nOkay, so I'm just trying to give\nyou a scenarios of when and\n\n226\n00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:52.097\nwhere you would want to\ndo something like this.\n\n227\n00:12:52.097 --> 00:12:56.884\nThe VLOKUP does work with text, and that's\nwhat you would wanna kinda stay with.\n\n228\n00:12:56.884 --> 00:13:01.190\nYou can nest it, and do matches, and\nindexes, and all this kinda stuff, so\n\n229\n00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:04.707\nthere are ways that you can pull\nthis out and make CHOOSE work.\n\n230\n00:13:04.707 --> 00:13:07.335\nBut it just seems kind of like\na more of a roundabout way.\n\n231\n00:13:07.335 --> 00:13:10.213\nAnd in certain ways like this,\nthis is pretty straightforward.\n\n232\n00:13:10.213 --> 00:13:15.047\nOkay, maybe just use the CHOOSE here,\nand VLOOKUPs here\n\n233\n00:13:15.047 --> 00:13:18.604\nwhen we're talking about text.\n&gt;&gt; You know it's\n\n234\n00:13:18.604 --> 00:13:20.130\nfunny that you bring that up.\n\n235\n00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:21.580\nYou're like, it has to be a numeric value.\n\n236\n00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:22.520\nThat makes sense, right?\n\n237\n00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.560\nWe're finding a relative position.\n\n238\n00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.430\nNow you'll have to help me out here,\nVonne.\n\n239\n00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:29.296\nIf we go back to that call ref decimal,\nbecause I forget,\n\n240\n00:13:29.296 --> 00:13:33.077\nthis is currently formatted as General,\nas far as the number formatting.\n\n241\n00:13:35.467 --> 00:13:40.240\nIf I force the Score\ncolumn to be raw text does\n\n242\n00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:44.221\nthat break?\n&gt;&gt; So instead of General or a number,\n\n243\n00:13:44.221 --> 00:13:48.437\ncuz we could take these, like you're\nsaying, we can just say numbers.\n\n244\n00:13:48.437 --> 00:13:50.520\nAnd we could also increase or\ndecrease the decimal and\n\n245\n00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:51.970\nthat's not going to do anything.\n\n246\n00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:53.940\nSo you're saying, what if I took this and\n\n247\n00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:57.940\nforced it as Text.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n248\n00:14:01.551 --> 00:14:03.110\n&gt;&gt; Still sees it.\n\n249\n00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:06.740\n&gt;&gt; What if we now type in\n\n250\n00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:09.168\na different something at that point?\n&gt;&gt; word.\n\n251\n00:14:09.168 --> 00:14:10.957\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's broke, but\n\n252\n00:14:10.957 --> 00:14:12.680\nif we go back and now type 3.\n\n253\n00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:18.605\nOkay so there's an implicit\nconversion kind of behind the scene.\n\n254\n00:14:18.605 --> 00:14:19.693\n&gt;&gt; Now that's just a great question,\n\n255\n00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:21.890\nhonestly.\n&gt;&gt; Now, I was just trying to break it,\n\n256\n00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:25.185\nbecause if it broke when you did that,\nif, unbeknownst to you,\n\n257\n00:14:25.185 --> 00:14:29.590\nyour column formatting could affect your\nCHOOSE function if you weren't careful.\n\n258\n00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:32.000\nBut it looks like they thought of that,\nluckily.\n\n259\n00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:36.659\nBut I would be careful there,\ncuz you may get weirdness, right?\n\n260\n00:14:36.659 --> 00:14:38.500\n&gt;&gt; You're going in your coding mind.\n\n261\n00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:42.220\nBecause as soon as you take a number and\n\n262\n00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:46.450\nwrap it in quotations marks,\nit's treated as text.\n\n263\n00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:52.260\nAnd once it's text, it's not a number,\nand so it would normally break.\n\n264\n00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:53.912\nSo I'm actually glad\nthat you went this way,\n\n265\n00:14:53.912 --> 00:14:55.437\nbecause I was actually a little curious.\n\n266\n00:14:55.437 --> 00:15:00.180\nI'm like, I'm not really sure.\n\n267\n00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:05.202\nThe, what you said, implicit value\nof what is in this cell, it's 9.\n\n268\n00:15:05.202 --> 00:15:09.750\nIt's not nine or\nanything with 9 with a quote.\n\n269\n00:15:11.376 --> 00:15:14.122\nWell that's gonna be text,\nyeah, of course, yeah.\n\n270\n00:15:14.122 --> 00:15:20.254\nWell, nine doesn't work either, so\nlet's go back to, [LAUGH] sorry, 4.\n\n271\n00:15:20.254 --> 00:15:26.091\nAnd then if I say \"4\", but then I'm-\n&gt;&gt; You're adding characters to it,\n\n272\n00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:26.605\nthen.\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n273\n00:15:26.605 --> 00:15:27.130\ncorrect.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n274\n00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:30.736\nit's not that you're\nformatting it as raw text.\n\n275\n00:15:30.736 --> 00:15:35.930\nYou're actually adding characters to it,\nso it gets weird.\n\n276\n00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:39.470\nThere's this double nesting of this\nraw text that also has quotes on it.\n\n277\n00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:40.065\nIt's that a string?\n\n278\n00:15:40.065 --> 00:15:42.831\nThis has this number 4.\n\n279\n00:15:42.831 --> 00:15:45.368\nNo.\n&gt;&gt; I've been hanging with out you too much\n\n280\n00:15:45.368 --> 00:15:49.729\non DevCoreTV so I've been doing so many\nthings like the programming fundamentals\n\n281\n00:15:49.729 --> 00:15:53.093\nwith Python, so I'm starting to\ncross my worlds a little bit.\n\n282\n00:15:53.093 --> 00:15:55.383\nBut that is really a great point.\n\n283\n00:15:55.383 --> 00:15:57.116\nEven though it's formatted as this text,\nit has to be a number.\n\n284\n00:15:57.116 --> 00:16:01.488\nBut also illustrates the point\nof you can't use a word For\n\n285\n00:16:01.488 --> 00:16:06.890\nthe look up value for\nthe choose function it has to be a number.\n\n286\n00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:08.910\nAnd it doesn't matter if it's a decimal.\n\n287\n00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:10.870\nIt will truncate it, and\n\n288\n00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:15.190\nit also has to be a number within the\nrange of the list length that you gave it.\n\n289\n00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:21.540\nSo a lot of parameters on this\nparticular function, a simple function.\n\n290\n00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:26.110\nAnd useful in certain case scenarios.\n&gt;&gt; Now Vonne what if someone was maybe not\n\n291\n00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:28.570\nreading the function dialogue box or\nthe documentation.\n\n292\n00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:34.893\nWhat happens if you do choose\na range instead of individual values\n\n293\n00:16:34.893 --> 00:16:36.530\ninside of the choose?\n\n294\n00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:41.623\nThat is a great question\nas well because you saw me\n\n295\n00:16:41.623 --> 00:16:47.720\nhere when I went to this I said\neach value had to be entered.\n\n296\n00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:54.578\nYeah, because you cannot do, here let's\nactually just delete this for fun, okay.\n\n297\n00:16:54.578 --> 00:17:00.317\nAnd I can't come into here, we'll just\ntype it out for fun, lets go with choose.\n\n298\n00:17:00.317 --> 00:17:03.260\nAnd then you say, all right,\nlet's look up this one.\n\n299\n00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.690\nIt's gonna break cuz I have the wrong one.\n\n300\n00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:10.093\nAnd then say, well,\nthen let's just select all of these.\n\n301\n00:17:10.093 --> 00:17:12.170\nCuz I would think to do that.\n\n302\n00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:14.220\nLike, yeah, here's my range.\n\n303\n00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:17.380\nYou see how many are in there, and so\nthat becomes one, two, three, four, five.\n\n304\n00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.990\nI'll bring this back to two.\n\n305\n00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:27.340\nStill doesn't work,\nyou cannot select a range.\n\n306\n00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:32.780\nIt has to be like value one, two,\nthree because that's the way it's working.\n\n307\n00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:37.260\nOtherwise it doesn't have anything to\nindex, it doesn't see it as a range, and\n\n308\n00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.130\nthen automatically index\nbased on what they see.\n\n309\n00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:42.787\nIt has to be individual values.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, again,\n\n310\n00:17:42.787 --> 00:17:46.899\nI'm always trying to make sure\nthat it breaks explicitly.\n\n311\n00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:49.480\nCuz, if you haven't,\nyou'll get burned by that.\n\n312\n00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:52.230\nWhat is the explicit error message there,\nbefore you fix it?\n\n313\n00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:53.530\nI just wanted to see.\n&gt;&gt; This\n\n314\n00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:54.710\none?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n315\n00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:55.860\n&gt;&gt; So it's just\n\n316\n00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.122\na value.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right, got you.\n\n317\n00:17:57.122 --> 00:17:58.416\n&gt;&gt; Just a value error, it's just like,\n\n318\n00:17:58.416 --> 00:18:01.070\nnope, can't find it.\n&gt;&gt; I was hoping maybe they'd be like,\n\n319\n00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:05.135\nrange error, or you used a range\ninstead of a value, shame on you.\n\n320\n00:18:05.135 --> 00:18:06.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n321\n00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:07.960\nsometimes the errors do tell you.\n\n322\n00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:11.990\nIt's just like, nope,\nthere is no value, I can't find it, so.\n\n323\n00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:14.630\nNow I did wanna just throw one\nother little quick example,\n\n324\n00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.290\nthat I thought was kind of cute.\n\n325\n00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:18.950\nAnd you know, I like cute things.\n\n326\n00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:23.695\nRandom names, if I have,\nlet's say, I have a pool of\n\n327\n00:18:23.695 --> 00:18:28.766\nnames that I want to randomly\nselect the winner out of it.\n\n328\n00:18:28.766 --> 00:18:32.075\nAnd then maybe that winner,\nlike the department gets free lunch or\n\n329\n00:18:32.075 --> 00:18:34.452\nsomething to that effect,\nthat could be cute.\n\n330\n00:18:34.452 --> 00:18:39.321\nWhen I go with here,\nwell here are the names that I want.\n\n331\n00:18:39.321 --> 00:18:43.380\nI wanna pick one out of it and\njust randomly choose one.\n\n332\n00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:49.616\nWell random, remember that RANDBETWEEN?\n\n333\n00:18:49.616 --> 00:18:52.770\nThat would be kind of a fun\nlittle thing that we could do.\n\n334\n00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:56.310\nSo if I went to here, so\nwhat's the index number?\n\n335\n00:18:56.310 --> 00:19:02.930\nWell, I want to randomly generate\na number between 1 and 5.\n\n336\n00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:07.240\nSo that's going to be the function that\nI'm actually calling in the index number.\n\n337\n00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.556\nSo it will just pick whatever,\n\n338\n00:19:10.556 --> 00:19:15.272\nand then I will have to\ngo through each one and\n\n339\n00:19:15.272 --> 00:19:20.769\ngo to Pumpkin, and Fuego,\none more, and Zinger.\n\n340\n00:19:20.769 --> 00:19:25.114\nAnd then I click okay, and\nthen it just pulls in Zinger.\n\n341\n00:19:25.114 --> 00:19:27.216\nWell fun, yeah.\n\n342\n00:19:27.216 --> 00:19:29.049\nI just clicked something, and you're like,\n\n343\n00:19:29.049 --> 00:19:31.590\nhow did that change?\n&gt;&gt; There's a keyboard shortcut if\n\n344\n00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:32.220\nyou do F9.\n\n345\n00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:37.931\nF9 like refreshes,\ncuz remember the RANBETWEEN is random.\n\n346\n00:19:37.931 --> 00:19:43.921\nSo if I did something else, it's gonna\nrandomly switch it, F9 is the same thing.\n\n347\n00:19:43.921 --> 00:19:47.820\nSo I could just like, okay,\npull it in, okay, look, Fuego.\n\n348\n00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:52.580\nFuego is the winner of this semester or\nwhat have you.\n\n349\n00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:56.990\nAnd then if wanted to pull in, like,\nlet's go ahead and copy these and\n\n350\n00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:58.910\nthen paste them in here.\n\n351\n00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:02.890\nWell, now it's just automatically\nrandomly generating Bell.\n\n352\n00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:06.890\nJust kind of a cute example\nof where you could find it.\n\n353\n00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:10.877\nAnd then you could use your department, I\nwould use a vertical look up on this one.\n\n354\n00:20:10.877 --> 00:20:14.566\nI would do a VLOOKUP here to then look for\nthis cell, find it in this range,\n\n355\n00:20:14.566 --> 00:20:17.630\nand then it will go ahead and\nreturn the department.\n\n356\n00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:18.380\nThat could be fun.\n\n357\n00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.228\nYou could actually pull it all together.\n\n358\n00:20:21.228 --> 00:20:24.460\n[LAUGH] I know this looks really scared,\nbut\n\n359\n00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:27.580\nif you think about it,\nwhat's the vertical lookup?\n\n360\n00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:32.800\nThe vertical lookup is looking at,\nwe can even say this cell.\n\n361\n00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:38.360\nBut instead of this cell,\nit's really this whole thing.\n\n362\n00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:42.910\nThis is where you're like,\nlooking at a function and its arguments.\n\n363\n00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:49.310\nThis whole thing of,\nchoose a random number between 1 and 5,\n\n364\n00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:55.340\nand then look toward's these cells to go\nahead and give me the name of the cat.\n\n365\n00:20:55.340 --> 00:21:00.716\nThat's all in lookup value,\nthat's the whole thing.\n\n366\n00:21:00.716 --> 00:21:02.040\nThen where am I going?\n\n367\n00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:09.630\nI'm going out to this table array\nover here to look at the whole table.\n\n368\n00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:14.120\nI'm returning the second column,\nwhat is the department that they are in?\n\n369\n00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:20.610\nAnd I want an exact match, so I can\njust pull that whole thing all together.\n\n370\n00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:24.820\nThat's we're just trying to understand\nthe arguments, understand each function.\n\n371\n00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:29.352\nThat's a pretty interesting little\ncombined function to then just\n\n372\n00:21:29.352 --> 00:21:35.570\nautomatically saying, here this is\nthe department that has won this semester.\n\n373\n00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:38.899\nOkay, this is this week,\nand the same people.\n\n374\n00:21:38.899 --> 00:21:42.624\nAnd then you could just change out\nthe values for what they're pulling for\n\n375\n00:21:42.624 --> 00:21:45.160\nthe random name, and\nthen you can generate that.\n\n376\n00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:50.070\nSo, that's again,\nfun little example of how you might wanna\n\n377\n00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:53.850\nchoose the choose function and\nput it in with other things.\n\n378\n00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:55.530\nSo, pretty straightforward.\n\n379\n00:21:55.530 --> 00:22:00.420\nDoes have some limitations, but you can\nfind out different places where you\n\n380\n00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.045\nmight wanna use it, if you've got numbers.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n381\n00:22:03.045 --> 00:22:06.555\nI tell what Vonne, throughout this series,\nwe're learning we have these kind of\n\n382\n00:22:06.555 --> 00:22:09.120\nlittle composable pieces\nthat we can snap together.\n\n383\n00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.719\nI don't know, maybe like the Legos,\nor Mega Blocks, or\n\n384\n00:22:11.719 --> 00:22:13.244\nmay be even just a jigsaw puzzle.\n\n385\n00:22:13.244 --> 00:22:15.993\nAnd end up with some\nwould argue beautiful,\n\n386\n00:22:15.993 --> 00:22:18.870\nsome would argue absolutely mind blowing.\n\n387\n00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:21.410\nBut I tell you what,\nyou should definitely come on back.\n\n388\n00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:24.500\nWe're continuing to look around, but\nfor now we're gonna go ahead and\n\n389\n00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:25.280\nwrap this one up.\n\n390\n00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.780\nSo signing off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n391\n00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:29.478\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n392\n00:22:29.478 --> 00:22:30.747\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n393\n00:22:30.747 --> 00:22:35.505\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
